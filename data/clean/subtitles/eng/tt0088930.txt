someone s got to break the ice 
i m used to being a hostess 
it s always difficult
when a group of new friends
meet together
the first time 
i m prepared to start
the ball rolling 
i have no idea
why we re here
or what this is about 
but i am determined
to enjoy myself 
i m very intrigued 
this soup s delicious  isn t it 
you re used to being a hostess 
it s part of your life
when you re the wife of a

mmm  this is one of
my favorite recipes 
i know  madam 
what do you do in washington 
mr  green

how are we to get acquainted
without talking 
perhaps he doesn t want to 
if i wasn t keeping
the conversation going 
we d be sitting in
an embarrassed silence 
are you afraid of silence 
yes  
no  why 
you suffer from what we call
  pressure of speech   
who s   we   
are you a shrink 
i know a little about
psychological medicine 
oh  you re a doctor 
yes  but i don t practice 
practice makes perfect 
i think most men need
a little practice 
don t you  mrs  peacock 
what do you do  professor 
i m with the united nations 
another politician 
jesus 
i work for w h o  
the world health organization

i ve seen you before 
although you may
not have seen me 
you live in washington  too 
sure do 
does anyone not live
in washington 
i don t 
but you have a government job 
anyone not earn their living
from the government 
one way or another 
where s our host 
and why are we here 
 doorbell rings 
 wadsworth 
ah  good evening 
you re eagerly awaited 
are you locking me in 
i ll take the key 
over my dead body  sir 
may i take your bag 
no  i ll leave it here 
it contains evidence  i presume 
it contains surprises  my friend 
ladies and gentlemen 
may i present mr  boddy 
what are they doing here 
eating dinner 
do sit down  mr  boddy 
thanks 
take that away  honey 
look  i demand to know
what s going on 
why have we been dragged here 
well  i believe
we all received a letter 
my letter says 
  it will be to your advantage
to be present 
mr  boddy will end
a long standing  confidential 
and painful financial liability   
signed    a friend   
i received a similar letter 
so did we 
i also received a letter 
no  thanks  yvette 
i just ate 
you know her 
we know each other 
don t we  dear 
did your letter
say the same thing 
no 
i see 
can i interest anyone
in fruit or dessert 
then we ll adjourn to the study
for coffee and brandy 
where our unknown host
will reveal his intentions 
there s no one here 
please help yourself to brandy
and be seated 
mind if i smoke 
ladies and gentlemen 
i m to explain what you have
in common with each other 
unless you would care to  mr  boddy 
why me 
do they know who i am 
no  you ve never
identified yourself 
it s a hoax 
i suggest we leave 
i m sorry 
you cannot leave this house 
who ll stop me 
there s no way out 
the windows have bars 
the doors are locked 
you can t hold us prisoner 
he s right 
please return to the study 
everything will be explained 
you  too  mr  boddy 
other way 
you can t get out 
it s only glass 
you all have one thing in common 
you re all being blackmailed 
for some time 
you ve been paying
more than you can afford
to someone threatening
to expose you 
and you don t know who 
that s ridiculous 
nobody could blackmail me 
i ve never done anything wrong 
anybody else wish to deny it 
very well 
as everyone here
is in the same boat 
i ll reveal some details 
as instructed 
thank you  yvette 
you might spare us
this humiliation 
i m sorry 
professor plum  you were once
a professor of psychiatry 
specializing in homicidal lunatics
suffering from
delusions of grandeur 
but now i m with
the united nations 
no change 
but you don t practice medicine 
his license to practice
has been lifted 
what did he do 
what doctors mustn t do
with their lady patients 
oh  how disgusting 
are you making moral judgments 
mrs  peacock 
how then do you
justify taking bribes
in return for delivering
senator peacock s vote to lobbyists 
my husband s a paid consultant 
there s nothing wrong with that 
not if it s publicly declared 
but if the payment is delivered
by slipping used greenbacks
under the door of the men s room 
how would you describe that 
i d say it stinks 
how would you know 
so it s true 
no  it s a vicious lie 
you ve been paying blackmail
for over a year
to keep that story
out of the papers 
i believe you 
i m being blackmailed
for something i didn t do 
  me  too 
  and me 
not me 
you re not 
i did what i m being
blackmailed for 
what did you do 
to be perfectly frank 
i run a hotel which provides
gentlemen with the company
of a young lady
for a short while 
oh  yeah 
what s the phone number 
was colonel mustard
one of your clients 
tell them that s not true 
it s not true 
really 
no 
aha  a double negative 
do you have photographs 
that sounds like a confession 
you gave yourself away 
are you trying to
make me look stupid 
you don t need help 
that s right 
what s so terrible
about colonel mustard
visiting a house of ill fame 
he holds a sensitive security post
in the pentagon 
you drive an expensive car
for a colonel 
i came into money during the war
when i lost my mommy and daddy 
mrs  white 
you ve paid the blackmailer
ever since your husband
died mysteriously 
why is that funny 
that s why he was
lying on his back 
i didn t kill him 
then why are you
paying the blackmailer 
i don t want a scandal 
we had a humiliating confrontation 
he was deranged 
he was a lunatic 
he didn t like me 
he threatened
to kill me in public 
why kill you in public 
he threatened in public
to kill her 
oh  was that his final word 
being killed
is pretty final  right 
he was the one
who died  not you 
what was his profession 
he was a scientist 
nuclear physics 
what was he like 
he was always
a stupidly optimistic man 
it was a shock
to him when he died 
his head had been cut off 
and so had his  uh   
you know 
i had been out all evening 
do you miss him 
now that he s dead 
i have a life 
he was your second husband 
your first husband also disappeared 
he was an illusionist 
but he never reappeared 
he wasn t a very good illusionist 
i have something to say 
i won t wait for wadsworth
to unmask me 
i work for the state department 
and i m a homosexual 
i feel no shame
or guilt about this 
but i must keep it a secret
or i ll lose my job
on security grounds 
thank you 
well   
that just leaves mr  boddy 
what s your secret 
haven t you guessed 
he s the one blackmailing you 
you bastard 
put  em up 
put  em up 
gentlemen   
if you can t fight fairly 
don t fight at all 
nobody calls me a bastard 
was that necessary 
mrs  white 
wait  wait 
the police are coming 
  no  no 
  oh  no 
listen 
blackmail depends on secrecy 
you ve admitted
he s blackmailed you 
tell the police 
and he ll be convicted 
it s not so easy 
you ll never tell the police 
then i shall 
this conversation
is being tape recorded 
point of order 
tape recordings aren t
admissible evidence 
the police arrive in 45 minutes 
tell them the truth 
and mr  boddy will be behind bars 
where are you going 
i can help them decide 
can i get my bag 
who can guess what s in here 
the evidence against us  no doubt 
did you know you were meeting us 
yes 
what were you told  precisely 
that you were meeting
to discuss our arrangements 
if i didn t appear 
wadsworth would inform the police 
i could hardly resist
putting in an appearance 
excuse me 
open them 
why not 
i enjoy getting presents
from strange men 
a candlestick 
what s this for 
in your hands 
you each have a lethal weapon 
if you denounce me to the police 
you will also be
exposed and humiliated 
i ll see to that in court 
but   
if one of you
kills wadsworth now 
no one but the seven
of us will ever know 
he has the key
to the front door 
which he said
would only be opened
over his dead body 
i suggest we take him up
on that offer 
to avoid finding yourselves
on the front pages 
one of you better
kill wadsworth   now 
 thump 
 moan 
 gunshot 
aaahh 
it s not wadsworth 
is he alive 
mr  boddy 
stand back 
let me see 
he s dead 
who had the gun 
i did 
you shot him 
i didn t 
if you didn t shoot him 
who did 
nobody 
there s no gunshot wound 
somebody grabbed the gun 
and it went off 
look 
the bullet broke that vase 
excuse me 
he s absolutely right 
there s a bullet hole 
how did he die 
i don t know 
i m not a forensic expert 
someone here must have killed him 
i didn t do it 
i need a drink 
maybe he was poisoned 
aah 
aah 
mrs  peacock  it s all right 
we don t know anything 
sit down 
sit down 
i had to stop her
from screaming 
was the brandy poisoned 
i don t know 
looks like we ll never know 
unless   
unless she dies  too 
aah 
aah 
aah 
it s locked 
open up 
it s the murderer 
he s got yvette 
oh  my god 
you re alive 
no thanks to you 
there s a murderer here 
the murderer s in this room 
but where 
where  here 
we re looking at him   or her 
like mrs  white said 
somebody here is a killer 
how did you know 
i was listening 
why were you screaming
all by yourself 
because i am frightened 
i also drink the cognac 
i can t stay here by myself 
come back to the study with us 
with the murderer 
there s safety in numbers  my dear 
there s no indication
of how he died 
no 
this is absolutely terrible 
it s not what i d intended 
my god 
not what you intended 
you re not the butler 
i m not the butler 
but i am a butler  his butler 
if he told you to invite us 
why was he late 
i invited you 
i wrote the letters 
it was all my idea 
wait a minute 
i  i don t understand 
were you assisting
your late employer
to blackmail us 
certainly not 
i think you d better explain 
please sit down  everyone 
when i said i was
mr  boddy s butler 
this was misleading 
i was once his butler 
but his death didn t
end my employment 
what did end it 
when my wife decided to   
end her life 
she  too  was being blackmailed
by this odious man 
he hated my wife
for the same reason
he hated all of you  
he believed you were
thoroughly un american 
i m sorry 
he felt it was inappropriate
for a senator
to have a corrupt wife 
for a doctor
to abuse his patients 
for a wife
to emasculate her husband 
and  and   so forth 
if he was so patriotic 
why didn t he report us 
he decided to make a little money 
what could be
more american than that 
what was your role 
i was a victim  too 
at least  my wife was 
she had friends who were   
socialists 
oh  my god 
well   
we all make mistakes 
mr  boddy threatened
to turn her in
unless she named the socialists 
she refused  so he blackmailed her 
the price of his silence
was that we work for him for nothing 
we were slaves 
to make a long story short   
too late 
my wife s suicide
preyed on my mind
and created a sense
of injustice in me 
i resolved to put mr  boddy
behind bars 
the best way to do this and
free you from blackmail
was to get everyone
face to face 
confront mr  boddy
with his crimes 
and turn him in 
everything s explained 
nothing s explained 
we don t know
who killed him 
we ve got to find out
in 39 minutes
before the police arrive 
we can t have them come now 
which of you did it 
what do you mean    you   
well  i didn t do it 
one of us did 
we all had a motive 
great 
we ll all get the chair 
  maybe it wasn t us 
  who else 
who else is here 
  only the cook 
  only the cook 
well  she s not here 
aah 
i didn t do it 
somebody help me  please 
somebody help me  please 
don t touch it 
that s evidence 
not for us 
we can t take fingerprints 
explain yourself  wadsworth 
me  why me 
why kill the cook 
dinner wasn t that bad 
how can you make jokes 
it s my defense mechanism 
if i was the killer 
i d kill you next 
i said if 
there s one admitted killer here 
it is her 
i ve admitted nothing 
how many husbands
have you had 
mine or other women s 
yours 
just the five 
husbands should be like kleenex  
soft  strong  and disposable 
you re like a spider luring flies 
flies are where men
are most vulnerable 
if it wasn t you 
who was it 
who had the dagger 
you  mrs  peacock 
yes  i put it down
in the study 
when 
before   or after i fainted 
any of you could
have picked it up 
i suggest we take the cook s body
into the study 
why 
butlers like keeping
the kitchen tidy 
look 
the body s gone 
  what are you staring at 
  nothing 
  well  who s there 
  nobody 
what do you mean 
i mean no body 
boddy s body s gone 
he was dead 
we should ve made sure 
how 
by cutting his head off 
we d better look for him 
well 
he couldn t have been dead 
he was 
at least  i thought he was 
what difference
does it make now 
makes a difference to him 
maybe there is life after death 
life after death s as improbable
as sex after marriage 
maybe mr  boddy killed the cook 
  yes 
  yes 
how 
uh   
excuse me 
i have to   
is there a little girl s room
in the hall 
oui  oui  madame 
no  i just want to
powder my nose 
what s this  wadsworth 
the negatives to which
colonel mustard earlier referred 
you planning to
blackmail him  wadsworth 
no  i planned on
returning them to the colonel
when mr  boddy was unmasked 
very pretty 
want to see these  yvette 
no  i am a lady 
what sort of pictures 
they re my pictures 
i d like them back 
no  something in them
concerns me 
let me see 
nobody can get
into that position 
sure they can 
let me show you 
get off me 
aah 
it s mr  boddy 
he s attacking her 
aah 
no  no  he s dead 
mr  boddy  dead   again 
oh  my god 
she s fainting 
somebody catch her 
i ll catch her 
sorry 
you ve got blood
on your hands 
i didn t do it 
he s certainly dead now 
why would anyone
want to kill him twice 
seems so unnecessary 
what we call overkill 
unless he wasn t dead before 
what s the difference 
that s what we re trying
to find out  
who killed him  where 
and with what 
no need to shout 
i m not shouting 
all right  i am 
i m shouting 
i m shouting  i m shou  
okay  put the corpses on the sofa 
ladies first 
careful 
don t get blood on the sofa 
how do we do this 
tip her forward over the arm 
now mr  boddy 
ready 
a little higher 
there we go 
now 
who   
who had access
to the candlestick 
everybody 
it was given to you 
i dropped it 
anyone could ve picked it up 
we still have these weapons  
the gun  rope  wrench  lead pipe 
let s put them in this cupboard
and lock it 
there s a homicidal maniac about 
  good idea 
  good idea 
i m putting the key
in my pocket for safety 
you can open it
whenever you want 
what if you re the murderer 
i m not 
if i ve got it 
i know i m safe 
we don t know that we are 
we ll throw it away 
good idea 
  wonderful 
  right away 
sorry 
sorry 
can we help 
i didn t mean
to disturb the household 
my car broke down 
i was wondering
if i could use your phone 
just a moment 
 whispering 
very well  sir 
would you care to come in 
where is it 
what  the body 
the phone  what body 
there s nobody    in the study 
but there s a phone
in the lounge 
thank you 
when you re finished 
be good enough to wait here 
certainly 
 door locks 
aah 
where s the key 
in my pocket 
the cupboard key 
should i still dispose of it 
  yes 
  yes 
well   
what now 
let me out 
no  we re all
in this together 
if you leave 
i ll say you killed
them both 
  me  too 
  me  too 
you ll pay for this 
one day  when we re alone  
no sensible man
would be alone with you 
i could use a drink 
so could i 
just checking 
everything all right 
yep  two corpses 
everything s fine 
anybody else want a whiskey 
yeah 
all right  look 
pay attention  everybody 
there s nobody else
in this house  correct 
no 
then there is someone else here 
i said   no   meaning yes 
i want a straight answer 
is there someone else 
yes or no 
uh  no 
no  there is  or isn t 
yes 
please 
shouldn t we get that man
out of the house 
how can we throw him out
in this weather 
he may get suspicious 
throw him out 
he ll get more suspicious 
if i were him 
i d be suspicious already 
let him stay locked up for
another half hour 
the police will be here by then 
and there are two dead bodies
in the study 
  shh 
  shh 
there s still some confusion
about whether there s anybody else here 
there isn t 
confusion or anybody else 
either 
give me a clear answer 
what was the question 
is anybody else in the house 
  no 
  no 
that s what he says 
but does he know 
i suggest we handle this
in proper military fashion 
we split up and
search the house 
split up 
yes  we have little time 
so we ll split up into pairs 
pairs  suppose one of us
is the murderer 
whoever s left with the killer
might get killed 
then we ll discover
the murderer 
but the other half of the pair
would be dead 
casualties are inevitable 
you cannot make an omelet
without breaking eggs 
every cook will tell you that 
look what happened to the cook 
you re willing to chance that 
what choice have we 
none 
i suppose you re right 
it s dark upstairs 
i m frightened of the dark 
will anyone go with me 
  i will 
  i will 
no  thank you 
i suggest we all draw lots
for partners 
ready 
the two shortest together 
the next two shortest together 
agreed 
the two shortest search the cellar 
and so on  up 
it s you and me  honeybunch 
oh  god

we know what s in the study 
we ve just come
from the library 
the stranger s in the lounge 
let s go look
in the billiard room again 
want to go up in front of me 
absolutely non 
there s nobody up there 
then you go in front 
all right 
well    ladies first 
no  you  you can go first 
no  i insist 
you fear a fate worse than death 
no  death 
isn t that enough 
are you going in there 
yes  are you 
yes 
right 
right 
i don t see
any light switches in there 
neither do i 
shall i come in with you 
no 
i mean

and i ve been locked
into the lounge 
yes 
the funny thing is

and one of them is
my old boss from

hello  hello 
 whispering 
shut the door 
did anyone recognize you 
they must have 
and not just my face 
they know every inch of my body 
and they re not the only ones 
it s you 
something funny s going on here 
i don t know what it is 
no  i m not on duty 
but i have a feeling
that i m in danger 
you know that big ugly house  
hello 
hello 
are you there 
aah 
i m coming 
i m trying to find the door 
help me 
coming 
what s this 
another door 
two murders 
neither of them shot 
i heard a gun 
so did i 
i heard the front door slam 
the murderer must ve run out 
three murders 
six all together 
this is getting serious 
no gun 
yvette dropped it here 
very well  i know who did it 
you do 
furthermore 
i ll tell you how it was done 
follow me 
i shall take you through
the events of the evening
step by step 
at the start of the evening 
yvette was here by herself 
waiting to offer you
a glass of champagne 
i was in the hall 
i know because i was there 
then i hurried across
to the kitchen 
the cook was in here alive 
sharpening knives 
and then   
the doorbell rang 
and it was you 
i recognized you as colonel mustard 
i prevented you
from telling your name 
i wanted you to use your pseudonym 
i ran across to the library 
yvette met you and smiled
and poured you a drink 
the doorbell rang 
it was mrs  white
looking pale and tragic 
and i took her coat and hung it up 
i introduced mrs  white
to colonel mustard 
hello  hello 
i noticed that mrs  white
and yvette flinched 
there was thunder and lightning 
to make a long story short  
too late 
you all arrived 
the gong struck the cook 
we went into the dining room 
mrs  peacock sat here 
professor plum sat here 
mrs  white sat here 
mr  green  miss scarlet 
colonel mustard 
this chair was vacant 
we all revealed
we d received a letter 
get on with it 
the point is    blackmail 
this came out
after dinner in the study 
you re right 
mr  green stood here 
mrs  peacock here 
miss scarlet here 
professor plum here 
colonel mustard and mrs  white 
get on with it 
mr  boddy went to get
the surprise packages 
you opened your presents 
mr  boddy switched off the lights 
  aah  aah 
  aah 
oh  grand 
mr  boddy lay on the floor
apparently dead 
he was dead 
he was bashed later on the head 
okay  i made a mistake 
why was mr  boddy
pretending to be dead 
he realized his scheme had misfired 
and the gunshot was intended for him 
look  the bullet grazed his ear 
to escape death 
he pretended to be dead 
the gunman tried to kill him 
but remember what happened next 
mrs  peacock took a drink 
you said    maybe it s poisoned   
she screams  aah 
we took her to the sofa 
mr  green   
well  i had to stop her screaming 
then  more screaming 
yvette 
the billiard room 
we all rushed out 
one of us wasn t here  no 
  no 
  no 
maybe one of us
was murdering the cook 
who wasn t here with us 
do you know 
i do 
while we stood here 
trying to stop yvette from panicking 
someone could ve stayed in here 
picked up the dagger 
run down the hall 
and stabbed the cook 
we might ve seen
him running back 
not if they used this secret passage 
he ran down this to the study 
that s where it comes out 
yes 
what 
how did you know 
i ve known all along 
you could be the murderer 
ridiculous  if i was 
would i reveal how i did it 
well  who else knew
about the secret passage 
we found it  mustard and me 
you found it 
you could ve known 
i didn t 
why should we believe you 
because she was with us
in the billiard room 
why was the cook murdered 
she had nothing to do with mr  boddy 
of course she did 
i gathered you here
because you were all implicated
in mr  boddy s blackmail 
didn t anyone deduce
the others were involved  too 
what others 
the cook and yvette 
no 
that s how he got
his information 
before blackmailing anyone 
mr  boddy had to discover
their guilty secret 
the cook and yvette
were his accomplices 
i see 
so whoever knew   
that the cook was involved   
killed her 
yes 
i know  because i was
mr  boddy s butler 
that the cook had worked
for one of you 
who 
you recognized yvette 
don t deny it 
what do you mean 
i m not denying anything 
another denial 
okay  i knew yvette 
my husband had an affair with her 
but i didn t care 
you knew yvette  too 
she worked for me 
you  also  sir 
we ve already established
that you were one
of miss scarlet s clients 
that s why you wanted
those negatives  
photographs of you and yvette
in flagrante delicto 
boddy threatened to send them
to my mother 
which would ve killed her 
that would ve been an achievement 
since you said she s dead already 
so  he had the motive 
you all did 
where was mr  boddy killed 
don t you see  look 
we returned to the study 
mr  boddy was pretending to be dead 
but someone knows he s alive 
i explained
that i d invited you here 
we realized only
one other person was here 
the cook 
well  where is he 
aah 
by now she was dead 
we laid her down 
someone slipped through
the same secret passage 
again 
of course 
back to the study 
the murderer was in
the secret passage 
meanwhile  mr  boddy
had been on the floor 
he jumped up 
the murderer came out of here 
picked up the candlestick 
mr  boddy followed us into here 
looking for an escape 
the murderer crept up   
and killed him 
will you stop that 
no 
then he threw him into the toilet
and rejoined us in the kitchen 
who wasn t in the kitchen
the entire time 
whoever it was is the murderer 
 toilet flushing 
we locked the weapons up
and ran to the front door   
to throw away the key 
the motorist 
i didn t throw it 
i put it in my pocket 
someone could ve removed it
and substituted another 
we were all in a huddle 
anyone could ve done that 
wait a minute 
colonel mustard
has a top secret pentagon job 
mrs  white s husband was
a nuclear physicist  and   
yvette is a link between them 
what s your top secret job 
he s working on the secret
of the next fusion bomb 
how did you know 
can you keep a secret 
so can i 
is this a plot 
or did mustard do it alone 
we shall see 
bad luck that motorist
arrived at that moment 
not luck  i invited him 
you did 
everyone here was
mr  boddy s victim or accomplice 
everyone who s died gave him
information about one of you 
i got them here
so they d give evidence
against him 
what about that motorist 
what information did he have 
he was my driver during the war 
what was he holding over you 
he knew that i was a war profiteer 
i stole essential
air force radio parts 
and i sold them
on the black market 
that s how i made all my money 
but that doesn t make me a murderer 
a lot of our airmen died
because their radios didn t work 
was the policeman working
for mr  boddy  too 
the cop was from washington 
he was on my payroll 
i bribed him
so i could carry on with business 
mr  boddy found out 
oh  my god 
oh  please 
and the singing telegram girl 
she was my patient once 
i had an affair with her 
that s how i lost my license 
mr  boddy found that out  too 
well  let s put her in the study 
so   
now you all know why they died 
whoever killed mr  boddy
also wanted his accomplices dead 
how did the murderer
know about them 
i d guessed that this young singer
told boddy about me 
i knew nothing about any of you 
the murderer needed
to get the weapons 
he stole the key 
we followed mustard s suggestion
to split up and
search the house 
that s right 
it was colonel mustard s suggestion 
someone got away from his partner
and hurried to the study 
on the desk was mr  boddy s envelope 
it contained photographs and letters  
the evidence of mr  boddy s informants 
where is the envelope now 
gone 
destroyed 
perhaps in the fire 
the only possible place 
aha 
having found out the whole story 
the murderer went to the cupboard 
took out the wrench   
then we found the secret passage
to the lounge 
where we found
the motorist dead 
and we couldn t get in 
yvette ran to the cupboard 
got the gun 
and shot the door open 
then the doorbell rang 
 doorbell rings 
whoever it is 
they ve got to go away 
or they ll be killed 
ooh 
have you ever given any thought
to the kingdom of heaven 
what 
repent 
the kingdom of heaven s at hand 
you ain t whistling dixie 
armageddon is almost upon us 
it s already here 
go away 
your souls are in danger 
our lives are in danger 
the cop arrived next 
we locked him up 
we forgot the cupboard was unlocked 
we split up 
and the murderer switched off
the electricity 
oh  my god 
not again 
turn on the lights 
sorry 
didn t mean to frighten you 
you re a bit late 
i hate when he does that 
then there were
three more murders 
who did it 
none of us killed
mr  boddy or the cook 
who did 
the person who wasn t with us 
yvette 
  yvette 
  yvette 
she was listening
to our conversation 
she thought he was dead 
while we examined
the bullet hole 
she got the dagger 
ran to the kitchen 
and stabbed the cook 
we didn t hear her scream
because mrs  peacock was screaming 
yvette screamed 
and we ran to her 
when did she kill mr  boddy 
when i said 
we ran to the kitchen 
yvette hid to check mr  boddy 
he got up and followed them 
she hit him on the head
and dragged him to the toilet 
why 
to create confusion 
it worked 
why did she do it 
she was acting under orders
from the person
who later killed her 
  who 
  who 
who 
was it one of her clients 
or was it a jealous wife 
or an adulterous doctor 
no 
it was her employer  miss scarlet 
that s a lie 
is it 
you used her 
you killed the motorist
when we split up
to search the house 
how could i have known
about the passage 
easy  yvette told you 
when we split up again 
you switched off the electricity 
it was easy for you
on the ground floor 
you got the rope 
strangled yvette 
ran to the library 
killed the cop 
picked up the gun
where yvette dropped it 
opened the front door 
recognized the singing telegram
from her photograph 
and shot her 
you ve no proof 
the gun is missing 
gentlemen  turn out your pockets 
ladies  empty your purses 
whoever has the gun
is the murderer 
brilliantly worked out  wadsworth 
i congratulate you 
me  too 
shut up 
i don t understand one thing 
one thing 
why did you do it 
half of washington
knows what you do 
you were in no real danger 
they don t know my real business 
my business is secrets 
yvette found them out for me 
the secrets of senator peacock s
defense committee 
of colonel mustard s fusion bomb 
professor plum s u n  contacts 
and the work of your husband 
the nuclear physicist 
so  it is political 
you re a communist 
no  communism is
just a red herring 
like all members of
the oldest profession 
i m a capitalist 
and i ll sell my secrets  
your secrets  
to the highest bidder 
what if we don t cooperate 
you will  or i ll expose you 
we ll expose you  six murders 
it won t enhance
your reputation at the u n 
if it s revealed
you ve been implicated
in adultery with a patient
and her death
and the deaths of five others 
i might go up in their estimation 
and it s no good   
blackmailing me  madam 
i have no money 
neither do i 
i know  sweetie pie 
you can pay me
in government information 
all of you 
except you  wadsworth 
you as a mere butler
have no access
to government secrets 
so  i m afraid
your moment has come 
not so fast 
i do have a secret or two 
such as 
the game s up 
there are no more bullets 
i won t fall for that 
one shot at boddy 
two for the chandelier 
two at the lounge door 
and one for the singing telegram 
that s not six 
count 
one shot at the chandelier 
that s 1 plus 2 plus 1 plus 1  
no  1 plus 1 plus 2 plus 1  
okay  1 plus 2 plus 1    
shut up 
there s one bullet left 
guess who s getting it 
 ringing 
ohh  aah 
i m only a guest 
where s the chief 
ah  wadsworth  well done 
i did warn you  my dear 
mr  hoover is an expert on armageddon 
don t hate me for trying
to shoot you 
frankly  scarlet 
i don t give a damn 
there are no bullets left 
1 plus 2   
plus 1    
plus 2   
plus 1 is   
the murderer ran to the study 
picked up the rope
and lead pipe 
ran to the billiard room 
strangled yvette 
ran to the library 
hit the cop
with the lead pipe 
the singing telegram s
at the door 
the murderer got the gun 
opened the door 
recognized the girl 
shot her 
and ran back to the cellar 
but colonel mustard
wasn t in the cellar 
no   but you were 
so 
you murdered them all 
you were missing
during the murders 
and the cook was once yours 
don t you remember
your fatal mistake 
you told us at dinner
we were eating
one of your favorite recipes 
and monkey s brains 
though popular in cantonese cuisine 
are not often found
in washington  d c 
is that what we ate 
why would i murder the others 
in case they knew your secret 
so this had nothing to do
with the disappearing
nuclear physicist 
communism was just a red herring 
mrs  peacock did it all 
there s no proof 
well  the gun is missing 
gentlemen  turn out your pockets 
ladies  empty your purses 
whoever has the gun   
is the murderer 
very well 
what do you propose
to do about it 
nothing 
nothing 
i don t approve of murder 
but you ve done a public service
by ridding it
of a blackmailer and his informers 
what happens when the police arrive 
why should the police come 
nobody s called them 
you mean   
that s right 
i suggest we stack
the bodies in the cellar 
lock it 
leave quietly one at a time 
and pretend this never happened 
great idea 
i ll leave first   
if you don t mind 
be my guest 
in fact 
we owe you a vote of thanks 
i told you i didn t do it 
what if the authorities find out 
the f b i  will handle that 
my call from mr  hoover 
i work for him 
that s how i know about you 
there s one thing
i don t understand 
one thing 
who was mrs  peacock
taking bribes from 
a foreign power 
her husband controls
defense contracts 
there ll be a cover up 
what could be gained by exposure 
does the f b i  clean up
after multiple murder 
yes  that s why it s run
by a man called hoover 
oh  mrs  peacock 
how did you know my name 
the kingdom of heaven is at hand 
okay  take her away 
take your hands off me 
i m a senator s wife 
wadsworth  we got her 
you see  it s like the mounties 
we always get our man 
mrs  peacock was a man 
would anyone care
for fruit or dessert 
sorry  didn t mean
to frighten anyone 
you re too late 
then there were three more murders 
  who did it 
  who did it 
let s consider each murder one by one 
you knew mr  boddy was still alive 
even psychiatrists
can tell the difference
between live and dead patients 
your shot missed in the dark 
so you pretended he was dead
and killed him later  unobserved 
right  he was missing
after we found the cook 
but he was with us
when we found yvette 
how d he kill the cook 
i didn t 
you expect us to believe that 
you should 
you killed the cook  
your ex cook 
who informed on you 
you made one fatal mistake 
at dinner 
mrs  peacock told us she was eating
one of her favorite recipes 
and monkey s brains 
though popular in cantonese cuisine 
are not often to be found
in washington  d c 
colonel mustard 
when we saw the motorist 
you took the key
to the weapons cupboard 
then you suggested
that we all split up 
you crossed the hall 
took the wrench 
ran to the conservatory 
entered the lounge 
killed the motorist
with a blow on the head   
like that 
this is incredible 
not so incredible
as what happened next 
after we all split up again 
i went upstairs with you  mrs  white 
and  while i was
in the master bedroom 
you hurried downstairs
and turned off the electricity 
got the rope
and throttled yvette 
your husband was shtupping yvette 
that s why you killed him  too 
yes 
yes  i did it 
i killed yvette 
i hated her   so   much 
it  it   the f  
it  flame  flames   
flames   on the side of my face 
breathing  breath  
heaving breaths 
heaving   
miss scarlet crossed to the library
and hit the cop 
whom she d been bribing 
with a lead pipe 
true or false 
true  who are you  perry mason 
so  mr  green
shot the singing telegram 
i didn t 
nobody s left 
but i didn t do it 
the gun s missing 
whoever s got the gun  shot the girl 
i shot her 
  you 
  you 
so  it was you 
i d planned to expose you 
i know 
i d rather expose myself 
please 
there are ladies present 
you thought mr  boddy
was dead  why 
you d never met him until tonight 
you re mr  boddy 
wait a minute 
so who did i kill 
my butler 
oh  shucks 
he was expendable 
like all of you 
i m grateful to you all
for disposing of my network of spies 
saved me a lot of trouble 
now there s no evidence against me 
this has nothing to do
with my disappearing
nuclear physicist husband
or colonel mustard s work
with the fusion bomb 
no 
communism was just a red herring 
the police will be here 
none of you will get away with this 
why should the police come 
nobody s called them 
you mean   
oh  of course 
why shouldn t we
get away with it 
we ll lock the bodies in the cellar 
leave quietly 
and forget this ever happened 
and you ll go on blackmailing us 
of course 
why not 
i ll tell you why not 
aah 
oh  good shot  green 
very good 
are you a cop 
no  i m a plant 
i thought you were a fruit 
very funny 
f b i  that phone call
from j  edgar hoover was for me 
i told you i didn t do it 
all right  who done it 
  they   she did   
  that lady   he   
  this one    i   
  gentlemen   
they all did it 
but if you want to know
who killed mr  boddy
