tuscany fried bats   
i do feel  reg  that any
anti imperialist group like ours   
   must reflect such a divergence
of interest within its power base 
  agreed  francis 
  judith s point of view is very valid   
   provided the movement never forgets
it is the unalienable right of every man   
  or woman 
   or woman   
   to rid himself   
  or herself 
  agreed 
  thanks  brother 
  or sister 
  or sister   
where was i 
  i think you finished 
  right 
  it is the birthright of every man   
  or woman 
shut up about women  stan 
you re putting us off 
women have a perfect right to play
a part in our movement 
why are you always
on about women  stan 
i want to be one 
what 
i want to be a woman 
from now on  i want you
all to call me loretta 
  what 
  it s my right as a man 
well  why do you want
to be loretta  stan 
i want to have babies 
you want to have babies  
it s every man s right to have
babies if he wants them 
  but you can t have babies 
  don t you oppress me 
i m not oppressing you  stan 
you haven t got a womb 
where s the fetus gonna gestate 
you gonna keep it in a box 
here  i ve got an idea  suppose you agree
that he can t actually have babies   
   not having a womb  which is nobody s
fault  not even the romans    
   but he has the right to have babies 
  good idea  judith 
we shall fight the oppressors for your
right to have babies  brother  sister 
  what s the point 
  what 
why fight for his right to have babies
when he can t have babies 
it is symbolic of our struggle
against oppression 
symbolic of his struggle
against reality 
  get out there  get out 
  it s dangerous out there 
larks  tongues  otters  noses 
ocelots  spleens

 romanes eunt domus  
 people called romanes

  come on 
  romanus 
  goes like 
  anus 
vocative plural of anus is 
  ani 
  romani 
   eunt   what is eunt 
  go 
  conjugate the verb  to go  
  ere  eo  is  it  imus  itis  eunt 
so eunt is 
third person plural  present indicative 
 they go  
but  romans go home  is an order 
so you must use the 
  imperative 
  which is 
  oh    i 
  how many romans 
  plural  plural  ite  ite 
  ite 
domus  nominative 
 go home   this is motion
towards  isn t it  boy 
dative  not dative

the accusative  accusative 
domum  sir  ad domum

having grabbed his wife 
we inform pilate   
   that she is in our custody 
and forthwith issue our demands 
  any questions 
  what exactly are the demands 
we re giving pilate two days to dismantle
the entire roman imperialist state   
   and if he doesn t agree
immediately  we execute her 
  cut her head off 
  cut all her bits off 
send them back on the hour  every hour 
show them we re not to be trifled with 
and of course  we point out that they bear
full responsibility when we chop her up   
   and that we shall not
submit to blackmail 
no blackmail 
they ve bled us white  the bastards 
they ve taken everything we had 
and not just from us  from our fathers 
and from our fathers  fathers

i ll grant you the aqueduct and sanitation 
the two things the romans have done 
  and the roads

without saying  don t they 
but apart from sanitation 
aqueduct and roads   
  irrigation 
  medicine 
  education

if the romans left 
public baths 
it s safe to walk in the streets
at night now 
they know how to keep order 
let s face it  they re the only ones
who could in a place like this 
all right  but apart from sanitation 
medicine  education  wine  public order

system and public health

if questioned  we are sewage workers
on our way to a conference

and founder of the pfj   
    will be coordinating consultant
at the drain head

terrorist action  as he has a bad back 
  aren t you gonna come with us 
  solidarity  brother 
oh  yes  solidarity  reg 
once in the sewer 
timing will be of the essence 
there is a roman feast later 
so we must move fast   
    and don t wear your best sandals 
turning left here  we enter
the caesar augustus memorial sewer 
and from there proceed directly
to the hypocaust 
this has just been re tiled 
so terrorists  careful with those weapons 
we will now be directly beneath
pilate s audience chamber itself

well  tough titty for you  fish face 
  all right 
  why you sly   
brothers  brothers

dreaming of being spat at in the face 
well  it s not exactly friendly

now  take my case 
they hung me up here five years ago 
every night they take me down
for 20 minutes   
   then they hang me up again 
which i regard as very fair
in view of what i ve done 
and if nothing else  it s taught me
to respect the romans   
   and it s taught me that
you ll never get anywhere in this life   
   unless you are prepared to do
a fair day s work for a fair day s   
shut up 
  pilate wants to see you

my address is a high point
of passover 
my friend biggus dickus has come
all the way from rome to hear it 
  hail caesar 
  hail caesar 
you re not   
you re not thinking of giving
it a miss this year  then  sir 
give it a miss  
well  it s just that they re
in a rather funny mood today  sir 
really  centurion 
i m surprised to hear a man like you
rattled by a rabble of rowdy rebels 
  a bit thundery  sir 
  take him away 
i m a roman  i can prove it  honestly 
and crucify him well 
biggus 
  i really wouldn t  sir 
  out of the way  centurion 
let me come with you  pontius  i may be
of assistance if there is a sudden crisis 
right  now  item four  attainment of world
supremacy within the next five years 
  francis  you ve done some work on this 
  yeah  thank you  reg 
well  quite frankly  siblings 
i think five years is optimistic   
   unless we can smash the roman
empire within the next 12 months 
  twelve months 
  yeah  12 months 
and let s face it  as empires go 
this is the big one 
so we gotta get up off our arses
and stop just talking about it 
hear  hear 
i agree  it s action that counts 
not words  and we need action now 
you re right  we could sit around here
all day  talking  passing resolutions   
   making clever speeches 
it s not gonna shift one roman soldier 
so let s just stop gabbing on about it 
it s completely pointless   
   and it s getting us nowhere 
  right 
i agree 
this is a complete waste of time 
they ve arrested brian 
  what 
  they ve dragged him off 
they re gonna crucify him 
right 
this calls for immediate discussion 
  what  
  immediate 
  right 
  new motion 
completely new motion 
that there be immediate action   
once the vote has been taken 
obviously once the vote s been taken 
can t act on a resolution   
  reg  let s go now  please 
  right  right 
in the light of fresh information
from sibling judith   
  not so fast  reg 
  reg  for god s sake 
it s perfectly simple 
all you ve gotta do is to go out
of that door now   
   and try to stop the romans
nailing him up 
it s happening  reg 
something s actually happening  reg

and sisterly greetings to you  brian   
   on this occasion of your martyrdom  
  what 
 your death will stand as a landmark
in the continuing struggle to liberate   
   the parent land from the hands
of the roman imperialist aggressors   
   excluding those concerned with
drainage  medicine  roads  housing   
   education  and any other romans
contributing to the welfare of jews   
   of both sexes
and hermaphrodites  
signed   on behalf of the p f j

terrific  great  reg explained it to me 
and i think it s great what you re doing 
thank you  brian  i ll never forget you 
so there you are 
i might have known
it would end up like this 
just think of all the love
and affection i ve wasted on you 
well  if that s how you treat
your poor  old mother   
   in the autumn years of her life 
all i can say is 
go ahead  be crucified 
see if i care 
  i might have known 
  mum  mum 
i don t know what
the world is coming to 
cheer up  brian 
you know what they say 
some things in life are bad 
they can really make you mad 
other things just make
you swear and curse 
when you re chewing on life s gristle
don t grumble
give a whistle
and this ll help things
turn out for the best
and
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the light side of life
if life seems jolly rotten
there s something you ve forgotten
and that s to laugh and smile
and dance and sing
when you re feeling in the dumps
don t be silly chumps
just purse your lips and whistle
that s the thing
and always look on
the bright side of life
come on 
always look on the right side of life
for life is quite absurd
and death s the final word
you must always face
the curtain with a bow
forget about your sin
give the audience a grin
enjoy it
it s your last chance anyhow
so always look on
the bright side of death
just before
you draw your terminal breath
life s a piece of shit
when you look at it
life s a laugh and death s a joke
it s true
you ll see it s all a show
keep  em laughing as you go
just remember that
the last laugh is on you
and always look on
the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
come on  brian  cheer up 
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the bright side of life
worse things happen at sea 
you know 
always look on the bright side of life
what have you got to lose 
you come from nothing   
   you re going back to nothing 
what have you lost 
nothing 
nothing will come from nothing 
you know what they say 
cheer up  you old bugger 
come on  give us a grin 
there you are 
see  the end of the film  incidentally 
this record is available in the foyer 
some of us have got to live
as well  you know 
who do you think pays
for all this rubbish 
they re not gonna make
their money back  you know
