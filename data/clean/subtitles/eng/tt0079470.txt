romanus
goes like
anus
vocative plural of anus is
ani
romani
eunt what is eunt
go
conjugate the verb to go
ere eo is it imus itis eunt
so eunt is
third person plural present indicative
they go
but romans go home is an order
so you must use the
imperative
which is
oh  i
how many romans
plural plural ite ite
ite
domus nominative
go home this is motion
towards isnt it boy
dative not dative
not the dative sir

the entire roman imperialist state
and if he doesnt agree
immediately we execute her
cut her head off
cut all her bits off
send them back on the hour every hour
show them were not to be trifled with

full responsibility when we chop her up
and that we shall not
submit to blackmail

my friend biggus dickus has come
all the way from rome to hear it
hail caesar
hail caesar
youre not
youre not thinking of giving
it a miss this year then sir
give it a miss
well its just that theyre
in a rather funny mood today sir
really centurion
im surprised to hear a man like you
rattled by a rabble of rowdy rebels
a bit thundery sir
take him away
im a roman i can prove it honestly
and crucify him well
biggus
i really wouldnt sir
out of the way centurion
let me come with you pontius i may be
of assistance if there is a sudden crisis
right now item four attainment of world
supremacy within the next five years
francis youve done some work on this
yeah thank you reg
well quite frankly siblings
i think five years is optimistic
unless we can smash the roman
empire within the next 12 months
twelve months
yeah 12 months
and lets face it as empires go
this is the big one
so we gotta get up off our arses
and stop just talking about it
hear hear
i agree its action that counts
not words and we need action now
youre right we could sit around here
all day talking passing resolutions
making clever speeches
its not gonna shift one roman soldier
so lets just stop gabbing on about it
its completely pointless
and its getting us nowhere
right
i agree
this is a complete waste of time
theyve arrested brian
what
theyve dragged him off
theyre gonna crucify him
right
this calls for immediate discussion
what
immediate
right
new motion
completely new motion
that there be immediate action
once the vote has been taken
obviously once the votes been taken
cant act on a resolution
reg lets go now please
right right
in the light of fresh information
from sibling judith
not so fast reg
reg for gods sake
its perfectly simple
all youve gotta do is to go out
of that door now

cheer up brian
you know what they say
some things in life are bad
they can really make you mad
other things just make
you swear and curse
when youre chewing on lifes gristle
dont grumble
give a whistle
and thisll help things
turn out for the best
and
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the light side of life
if life seems jolly rotten
theres something youve forgotten
and thats to laugh and smile
and dance and sing
when youre feeling in the dumps
dont be silly chumps
just purse your lips and whistle
thats the thing
and always look on
the bright side of life
come on
always look on the right side of life
for life is quite absurd
and deaths the final word
you must always face
the curtain with a bow
forget about your sin
give the audience a grin
enjoy it
its your last chance anyhow
so always look on
the bright side of death
just before
you draw your terminal breath
lifes a piece of shit
when you look at it
lifes a laugh and deaths a joke
its true
youll see its all a show
keep em laughing as you go
just remember that
the last laugh is on you
and always look on
the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
come on brian cheer up
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the bright side of life
worse things happen at sea
you know
always look on the bright side of life
what have you got to lose
you come from nothing
youre going back to nothing
what have you lost
nothing
nothing will come from nothing
you know what they say
cheer up you old bugger
come on give us a grin
there you are
see the end of the film incidentally
this record is available in the foyer

for all this rubbish
theyre not gonna make
their money back you know
