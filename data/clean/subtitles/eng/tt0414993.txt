xibalba
it was their underworld
the place the dead souls go to be reborn
what what are you talking about
my book
im writing about it
i thought it took place in spain
it begins there
ends there
are you done
almost
good when do i read it
someday soon it will explode die
and give birth to new stars
how amazing that the mayans chose
a dying star to represent their underworld
of all the healthy points of light in the sky
how did they find one that was dying
where are your shoes
izzi come on come on

youve got to see for yourself
come right away
no i cant now i cant
to donovan
whats going on
show him
i came to check up on donovan
where is donovan
thats him
what it cant be
hes almost healed
theres hair growth
i didnt believe it either
antonio had me run some tests
donovan responded well
really well
i pulled up videos of him preop
hes testing twice as well
were seeing an increase in neural activity
in all areas usually stunted by ageing
and the tumor
no change
the growth patterns are normal
theres no positive or negative effect
we should tell dr guzetti right away
no no
antonio
prep a new cocktail
stick with the same substance
what
were moving forward
wait
but this could be a medical first
a revelation weve gotta pursue it
and duplicate the findings
we can monitor synaptic growth
but our focus is tumors not ageing
i know but
i want the next subject ready for surgery
is everything all right
yes
everythings all right
inquisitor
enter
the heretics
they have confessed
and ceded their lands to your holy office
they await yourjudgment
yet another slice of her nation is mine
soon she will be powerless against me
queen of nothing but her sins
what will you do with her
she too will confess
and then
she too will die
captain tis the queen
she is surrounded
the inquisitor demands blood
then there is no more time
what is our response
go now
warn the queen
and you where are you going
he must be cut out
she has forbidden it
there is no other choice
this is our only hope
stay stay
our bodies are prisons for our souls
our skin and blood
the iron bars of confinement
but fear not
all flesh decays
death turns all to ash
and thus
death frees every soul
you the condemned
you have confessed
you admit to protecting a queen
who twists the word of god
and drowns all spain in sin
your queen seeks immortality on earth
a false paradise
this is heresy
she leads you towards vanity
away from the spirit
but this is foolishness
for death exists
the day of judgment is irrefutable
all life must be judged
why are you here
come quickly
leave protect the queen
she sent me she demands your return
not before he dies
no tomas leave him
she desires a private audience
but fear not
she will not be in hell alone
i will make sure
her servants are waiting for her
faithful servant why do you cry
to see spain brought so low
with an enemy thriving within her borders
feasting on her strength
the shame is too much
ive failed her
dare not pity spain
these times are dark
but every shadow no matter how deep
is threatened by morning light
of course
this loyalty of yours
inspires you to protect spain at any cost
but killing the inquisitor is suicide
europe would have my head
i for one am not ready to die yet
are you
i will die for spain
i know conquistador
i know
and this bravery of yours
it may save us yet
for spain has a plan
there is hope
theres hope
father
i am father avila
of her royal franciscan order
our allegiance remains with spain
father
guards leave us
conquistador
i am going to tell you the true reason
why the inquisitor pits cross against crown
one year ago father avila returned
from the jungles of new spain
with a secret so great
it promised to free
all mankind from tyranny
spain desired this treasure
above all things
but the inquisitor feared it
with equal measure
when i refused to give up my quest for it
he responded with this violent coup
to bring spain to her knees
but we have not yielded
and now we will defeat him
this is our hope
a dagger
used in religious rituals
i took it from a dead mayan priest
the marking on the hilt
do you see it
it is a map
a map to the mayans greatest secret
greater than chichen itzá greater than
yaxchilán greater even than tikal
here in the centre in the core
of the oncegreat mayan civilization
we will find a lost pyramid
no
not lost
hidden
the hidden pyramid of the mayan myths
the myths tell us of a holy pyramid
built upon the navel of the earth
the birthplace of life
a special tree sprouts there
they say whoever drinks of its sap
will live forever
eternal life
spain hangs at the whims of a merciless
enemy and you taunt us with yarns
they are not yarns
remember
our own bible confirms it
in genesis there are two trees
in the garden of eden
the tree of knowledge
and the tree of life
when adam and eve disobeyed the lord
and ate from the tree of knowledge
the lord banned them from the garden
and hid the tree of life
could it be
could it be
kneel conquistador
let in the morning light
the beast runs amok in my kingdom
he has isolated me
and now he is sharpening his talons
for one more fateful push
but salvation lies
in the jungles of new spain
will you deliver spain from bondage
upon my honor and my life
then you shall take this ring
to remind you of your promise
you shall wear it when you find eden
and when you return
i shall be your eve
together we will live forever
iz
izzi
there you are
hey what are you doing here
babe we have lipper at three
this is an actual mayan book
look it explains their creation myth you see
thats first father hes the very first human
is he dead
he sacrificed himself to make the world
the tree of lifes bursting out of his belly
come on
listen his body became the trees roots
they spread and formed the earth
his soul became the branches
rising up forming the sky
all that remained
was first fathers head
his children hung it in the heavens
creating xibalba
xibalba the star
nebula
so what do you think
about
that idea
death as an act of creation
stay together guys
ill pull out the car
and meet you in front
iz iz

remember moses morales
who
the mayan guide i told you about
from your trip
the last night i was with him
he told me about his father who had died
but moses wouldnt believe it
izzi
no no listen listen
he said if they dug his fathers body up
he would be gone
theyd planted a seed over his grave
the seed became a tree
moses said his father became part of that tree
he grew into the wood into the bloom
and when a sparrow ate the trees fruit
his father flew with the birds
he said
death was his fathers road to awe
thats what he called it
the road to awe
now
ive been trying to write the last chapter and
i havent been able to get that out of my head
why are you telling me this
im not afraid anymore tommy
i asked lilly if i could be buried at her farm
no stop it
i want you to be with me
i am with you look
ill always be with you
i promise
will you stay with me tonight
yeah ill stay
ill stay
dont worry
were almost there
through that last dark cloud is a dying star
and soon enough xibalba will die
and when it explodes
you will be reborn
you will bloom
and i will live
dont worry
were almost there
thank you lord we are here
circles
he leads us in circles
only we are left
all of your countrymen are dead
he killed them all with this blind quest
its time time to stop him
captain we are lost
the franciscan and his tales are false
there is no hope for us here
theres only death
ive mapped us a course back to the ships
coward
damn the maps
were close and i will find it
captain captain captain
father what is it franciscan
in the jungle
the marking on the hilt
on the dagger
it is the same the same as on the stone
your choice  die now
or by my side fight and live
you fool
captain
father

we are here
where
the temple is there

it seems to me that we struggle
all our lives to become whole
complete enough when we die
to achieve a measure of grace
few of us ever do
most of us end up going out
the way we came in kicking and screaming
but somehow izzi young as she was
she achieved that grace
in her last days she became whole
she saw her
