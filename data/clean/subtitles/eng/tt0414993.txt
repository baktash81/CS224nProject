  just said to grab you and meet in surgery 
  where is he 
  i m not sure 
  call him 
  ok 
antonio sent me ahead with the scans 
he s still busy in chem lab 
breeny  it s manny 
where s antonio 
  it s still growing aggressively 
  that much in two days 
what do you mean  you don t know 
go get him  find him 
he s been lying open 50 minutes now 
  he s crossing the street

  i didn t ask 
  meet him at the elevator  get his ass in here 
micromanipulators at 42 degrees 
mediolateral  72 
yup 
how we doing  donovan 
you hanging in 
no good 
great specificity  but no suppression 
  shall we close 
  no  euthanize 
  why 
  if we don t treat now  the growth gets him 
dammit 
  i ll prepare the pentabarbital 
  no  wait 
  what is it 
  that compound we played with last year 
  which one 
  from that tree from central america 
  that one 
   natul tortuosa  82 a46  
  from guatemala 
  the old growth tree 
we had two samples  but it was sterile 
the graftings and clippings didn t take either 
  that s it 
  what s happening 
mix it with your compound 
they ve got a similar structure 
  manny  find those samples 
  i don t see it 
picture them side by side 
fold them into each other like two lovers 
woman on top 
they have complementary domains 
  if we can get them to stick   
  is this it 
  go 
  we have no toxicity reports  not a single   
it doesn t matter  donovan s on the table 
if we do nothing  he dies 
  antonio  how long 
  two hours 
keep him under 
  i ve never seen that adhesion pattern 
  what s it binding to it 
i don t know  but it s definitely
attaching to the high growth regions 
let s do it 
 751  1 25 
  syringe is loaded 
  give it 
manny  give me light 
lowering 
  injecting 
  injection at 23 57

  the gold star 
it s actually a nebula wrapped around
a dying star  that s what makes it look gold 
what 
  i took science 
  when 
junior high 
  the mayans called it xibalba 
  xibalba 
it was their underworld 
the place the dead souls go to be reborn 
what  what are you talking about 
my book 
  i m writing about it 
  i thought it took place in spain 
it begins there 
ends there 
are you done 
  almost 
  good  when do i read it 
someday soon it will explode  die 
and give birth to new stars 
how amazing that the mayans chose
a dying star to represent their underworld 
of all the healthy points of light in the sky 
how did they find one that was dying 
where are your shoes 
izzi  come on  come on 
let s warm you up 
whoa  whoa  careful 
ok  i ll get it

tommy 
  i m calling dr  lipper

jesus  i m sorry 
  it s been happening for a while 
  what 
  i m losing sensitivity to hot and cold 
  why didn t you tell me

tommy 
oh  jesus 
look  don t worry

i know  yes  i know  iz

  hello 
  alan  tommy 
  tommy 
  what s the earliest you can make tomorrow 
  let me check my schedule 
  it s time for you to read it 
  three  i m in surgery till then  is it urgent 
  no  no  that s fine  thanks  alan  bye 
  we re going to see him tomorrow 
  start it  tell me what you think 
  but it s not done 
  not quite 
don t answer it 
  hello  antonio  what s wrong 
  can you get down here 
  what is it 
  donovan 
  is he ok 
  he s perfectly fine 
  what s happening 
  you won t believe me 
you ve got to see for yourself 
come right away 
no  i can t now  i can t 
  to donovan 
  what s going on 
  show him 
  i came to check up on donovan 
  where is donovan 
  that s him 
what  it can t be 
he s almost healed 
there s hair growth 
  i didn t believe it either 
  antonio had me run some tests 
donovan responded well 
really well 
i pulled up videos of him pre op 
he s testing twice as well 
we re seeing an increase in neural activity
in all areas usually stunted by ageing 
  and the tumor 
  no change 
the growth patterns are normal 
there s no positive or negative effect 
  we should tell dr  guzetti right away 
  no  no 
antonio 
prep a new cocktail 
stick with the same substance 
what 
  we re moving forward 
  wait 
but this could be a medical first 
a revelation  we ve gotta pursue it
and duplicate the findings 
we can monitor synaptic growth 
but our focus is tumors  not ageing 
  i know  but   
  i want the next subject ready for surgery 
  is everything all right 
  yes 
everything s all right 
inquisitor 
enter 
the heretics 
they have confessed
and ceded their lands to your holy office 
they await yourjudgment 
yet another slice of her nation is mine 
soon she will be powerless against me 
queen of nothing but her sins 
what will you do with her 
she too will confess 
and then
she too will die 
captain   tis the queen 
she is surrounded 
the inquisitor demands blood 
then there is no more time 
what is our response 
go now 
warn the queen 
  and you  where are you going 
  he must be cut out 
  she has forbidden it 
  there is no other choice 
this is our only hope 
stay  stay 
our bodies are prisons for our souls 
our skin and blood 
the iron bars of confinement 
but fear not 
all flesh decays 
death turns all to ash 
and  thus 
death frees every soul 
you  the condemned 
you have confessed 
you admit to protecting a queen
who twists the word of god
and drowns all spain in sin 
your queen seeks immortality on earth  
a false paradise 
this is heresy 
she leads you towards vanity 
away from the spirit 
but this is foolishness 
for death exists 
the day of judgment is irrefutable 
all life must be judged 
  why are you here 
  come quickly 
  leave  protect the queen 
  she sent me  she demands your return 
  not before he dies 
  no  tomas  leave him 
she desires a private audience 
but fear not 
she will not be in hell alone 
i will make sure
her servants are waiting for her 
faithful servant  why do you cry 
to see spain brought so low 
with an enemy thriving within her borders 
feasting on her strength 
the shame is too much 
i ve failed her 
dare not pity spain 
these times are dark 
but every shadow  no matter how deep 
is threatened by morning light 
of course 
this loyalty of yours
inspires you to protect spain at any cost 
but killing the inquisitor is suicide 
europe would have my head 
i  for one  am not ready to die yet 
are you 
i will die for spain 
i know  conquistador 
i know 
and this bravery of yours 
it may save us yet 
for spain has a plan 
there is hope 
  there s hope 
  father 
i am father avila
of her royal franciscan order 
our allegiance remains with spain 
father 
guards  leave us 
conquistador 
i am going to tell you the true reason
why the inquisitor pits cross against crown 
one year ago  father avila returned
from the jungles of new spain
with a secret so great 
it promised to free
all mankind from tyranny 
spain desired this treasure
above all things 
but the inquisitor feared it
with equal measure 
when i refused to give up my quest for it 
he responded with this violent coup
to bring spain to her knees 
but we have not yielded 
and now we will defeat him 
this is our hope 
  a dagger 
  used in religious rituals 
i took it from a dead mayan priest 
the marking on the hilt   
do you see it 
it is a map 
a map to the mayans  greatest secret 
greater than chichen itzá  greater than
yaxchilán  greater even than tikal 
here  in the centre  in the core
of the once great mayan civilization 
we will find a lost pyramid 
no 
not lost 
hidden 
the hidden pyramid of the mayan myths 
the myths tell us of a holy pyramid 
built upon the navel of the earth 
the birthplace of life 
a special tree sprouts there 
they say whoever drinks of its sap
will live forever 
eternal life 
spain hangs at the whims of a merciless
enemy and you taunt us with yarns 
they are not yarns 
remember 
our own bible confirms it 
in genesis  there are two trees
in the garden of eden  
the tree of knowledge
and the tree of life 
when adam and eve disobeyed the lord
and ate from the tree of knowledge 
the lord banned them from the garden
and hid the tree of life 
could it be 
could it be 
kneel  conquistador 
let in the morning light 
the beast runs amok in my kingdom 
he has isolated me 
and now he is sharpening his talons
for one more fateful push 
but salvation lies
in the jungles of new spain 
will you deliver spain from bondage 
upon my honor and my life 
then you shall take this ring
to remind you of your promise 
you shall wear it when you find eden 
and when you return 
i shall be your eve 
together  we will live forever 
iz 
izzi 
  there you are 
  hey  what are you doing here 
  babe  we have lipper at three 
  this is an actual mayan book 
look  it explains their creation myth  you see 
that s first father  he s the very first human 
is he dead 
he sacrificed himself to make the world 
  the tree of life s bursting out of his belly 
  come on 
listen  his body became the tree s roots 
they spread and formed the earth 
his soul became the branches 
rising up  forming the sky 
all that remained
was first father s head 
his children hung it in the heavens 
creating xibalba 
xibalba  the star 
nebula 
  so what do you think 
  about 
that idea 
death as an act of creation 
stay together  guys 
i ll pull out the car
and meet you in front 
iz  iz 
  tommy 
  hey

  what the hell s going on 
  i brought in dean katari and dr   
i m sorry  what are you doing here 
  antonio and betty were just showing me   
  donovan s synaptic growth increased 
his brain is identical to scans
from 12 years ago  when he was six 
and the tumor 
  exactly  please 
  tommy   
please 
perhaps you should wait for me in my office 
manny  i ll be right there

  that s for you

it s all done except the last chapter 
i want you to help me 
how 
finish it 
finish it 
  i don t know how it ends 
  you do 
you will 
stop 
  remember moses morales 
  who 
  the mayan guide i told you about 
  from your trip 
the last night i was with him 
he told me about his father who had died 
  but moses wouldn t believe it 
  izzi 
no  no  listen  listen 
he said if they dug his father s body up 
he would be gone 
they d planted a seed over his grave 
the seed became a tree 
moses said his father became part of that tree 
he grew into the wood  into the bloom 
and when a sparrow ate the tree s fruit 
his father flew with the birds 
he said
death was his father s road to awe 
that s what he called it 
the road to awe 
now 
i ve been trying to write the last chapter and
i haven t been able to get that out of my head 
why are you telling me this 
i m not afraid anymore  tommy 
i asked lilly if i could be buried at her farm 
no  stop it 
  i want you to be with me 
  i am with you  look 
i ll always be with you 
i promise 
will you stay with me tonight 
yeah  i ll stay 
i ll stay 
don t worry 
we re almost there 
through that last dark cloud is a dying star 
and soon enough  xibalba will die 
and when it explodes 
you will be reborn 
you will bloom 
and i will live 
don t worry 
we re almost there 
thank you  lord  we are here 
circles 
he leads us in circles 
only we are left 
all of your countrymen are dead 
he killed them all with this blind quest 
it s time  time to stop him 
captain  we are lost 
the franciscan and his tales are false 
there is no hope for us here 
there s only death 
  i ve mapped us a course back to the ships 
  coward 
damn the maps 
we re close and i will find it 
captain  captain  captain 
father  what is it  franciscan 
in the jungle   
the marking on the hilt 
  on the dagger 
  it is the same  the same as on the stone 
your choice   die now
or  by my side  fight and live 
  you fool 
  captain 
father 
take it 
we are here 
  where 
  the temple is there 
sorry  father 
for you  there is only death 
but our destiny is life 
you shall wear it when you find eden 
and when you return 
i shall be your eve

it seems to me that we struggle
all our lives to become whole 
complete enough when we die
to achieve a measure of grace 
few of us ever do 
most of us end up going out
the way we came in  kicking and screaming 
but somehow izzi  young as she was 
she achieved that grace 
in her last days she became whole 
she saw her   
tommy 
  tommy
