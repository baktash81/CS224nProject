um 
do you ever laugh on people
with retardation 
here in america  we try not to   
make fun of or be funny with things
that people don t choose 
but perhaps you have not seen  um   
someone with a very funny retardation 
my brother bilo   
have a very funny  uh  retardation 
um  in mental retardation  you know   
it causes a lot of pain and hardship
for a lot of families 
sometime my sister

it s the theory that women
should be equal to men   
in matters economic 
  social and political 
  now  you are laughing
