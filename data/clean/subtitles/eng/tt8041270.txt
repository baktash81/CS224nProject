keep it steady 
damn  i don t see it  do you see it 
settle down  kid  she can t run forever 
dinosaurs are in our world 
and with every confrontation  we learn
more about this frightening new reality 
how did we get here 
oh  my god 
it s been three decades
since the deadly events at jurassic park 
and we ve yet to find a way
for these animals to live safely among us 
after the devastating eruption
of isla nublar s long dormant volcano 
those who survived were transported
to the mainland 
many of the larger predators
were captured 
but the remaining creatures
scattered here 
in big rock national park 
while most remained in the wild 
those who made their way to civilization
struggled to adapt
to unfamiliar conditions 
local authorities have warned
the animals are unpredictable 
and when hungry  extremely violent 
as the dinosaurs spread across borders 
a global black market has risen 
  they re not ours 
  go on  you sad  pathetic loser 
to combat the growing threat
of illegal poachers 
the us congress awarded
sole collection rights
to the global giant biosyn genetics 
at biosyn  we re dedicated to the idea
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves 
ceo lewis dodgson has created
a sanctuary in italy s dolomite mountains 
where he hopes to study
the dinosaurs  ancient immune systems
for unique pharmaceutical properties 
while biosyn believes
we can handle genetic power responsibly 
the public remains skeptical 
some note these government contracts have
led to massive spikes in biosyn s profits 
and rumors persist of a human clone
who mysteriously disappeared 
leading to a worldwide search 
some believe she s genetically identical
to charlotte lockwood 
deceased daughter of jurassic park
co founder  benjamin lockwood 
now that we brought these animals
back from extinction 
can we face the consequences 
are we responsible for them 
or should they be left
to fend for themselves 
as we adapt to an ever changing world 
we must find answers to these questions 
for their safely as well as for our own 
let it go 
hold on 
we are inside
the illegal breeding facility 
the juveniles are kept in cages
to keep costs down 
it s medieval 
claire 
why do you think he s separated
from the rest 
i don t think he s gonna make it 
no  what are you doing 
we could report this 
the dfw takes days to investigate 
we can save this one now 
it s okay  it s okay  buddy 
okay  here we go 
nope  no 
  lift 
  okay 
  support the head 
  yeah 
okay  yeah 
  hurry up 
  check the right side 
  with me 
  go  go  go 
okay  come on 
come on  let s go 
  hold on 
  to what 
shit 
claire  we re gonna get shot 
  no  claire  no  no  claire 
  oh  god 
oh  shit 
everybody good 
  no 
  no 
okay  okay  so i think
we get this one to the dfw 
and then we hit them again 
yeah  yeah  you saw
that breeding ground  right 
we re done 
i got a call last week 
it s a real job  something i can do
to effectively change things 
  i gotta take it 
  they need us 
are you saving these dinosaurs
because they need us 
or are you saving them
to absolve yourself 
  claire 
  i mean  this is crazy 
claire 
you re doing the right thing 
but this    this isn t the way
to go about it anymore 
honestly  you need someone
who s good at being shot at 
aren t you and owen still 
like  a weird thing 
  it s not that weird 
  he didn t mean  weird  
  mm mmm 
  no 
uh  he meant  like  surprising 
hyah 
let s bring  em home 
hyah 
hyah 
no 
okay  come here 
okay 
hey  hey 
we re gonna get you
someplace safe 
hey 
there you go 
there you go 
yeah 
shit 
poaching s three to five 
y all know that 
looks like we ll be
taking that animal off your hands 
like hell you will 
all right  seems our friend
don t recognize the badge 
department of fish and wildlife 
we re rounding up that dinosaur
for its own safety 
that s funny 
 cause my friends here 
they typically know all the new recruits 
shep  do you remember meeting these guys
in orientation or not 
nope 
dinosaur bone powder goes for what 
3000 an ounce 
makes this animal here worth about   
shoot   500 000 
how y all want this to go  huh 
your bones ain t worth nothing to me 
hey  brother 
he ain t lying 
i ll see you around 
never seen you walk away
from a fight before 
yeah 
i got obligations 
shouldn t you be in school 
i m homeschooled 
that so 
and where s home 
i don t know 
whoa 
better not stand there  man 
holy crap 
what in the world  man 
so  the dinosaurs   
hey 
where you been 
nowhere 
what are you burning 
oh  nothing  just some old blankets 
you sure you didn t go past the bridge 
that s the look you give me
when you think i m lying 
  well  are you 
  no 
maisie  you re literally looking
everywhere but here 
i said i didn t go past the bridge 
maisie 
can we start over 
i know  claire  there are people out there
who ll do anything to find me 
i m not angry 
  that means you don t have to be angry 
  i m not angry 
  i can take care of myself 
  hey 
it s okay for us to depend on each other 
that s what people do 
how would i know what people do 
the only people i ve spoken to
in the past four years are you both 
besides 
i m not even a real person anyway 
  what 
  i was made from someone else 
i m not me 
you are the only you who ever was 
what 
  n no 
  was that  like  really corny 
it was so corny 
  can we keep that between us 
  can t promise that 
  hey  kid 
  hello 
sorry i m late 
aw 
you smell like horses 
  mmm 
  oh  you like that  do ya 
  i do  yeah 
  oh 
okay  um   
i m gonna make dinner 
everything okay 
she went into town again 
ah  this kid 
did you talk to her 
i tried 
i ll talk to her 
slow breaths  take your time 
hey  cut away from yourself 
whoa 
wanna know how to win
a knife fight 
you gotta let yourself get cut 
make sure they re cutting
something dispensable
while you re cutting something vital 
and then say something cool like   
 wrong girl  wrong time  
wrong girl  wrong time 
whoo 
  stone cold 
  right 
  i would not mess with her 
  no way 
listen  we should probably
talk about you going into town 
i don t   
i don t think you understand
how bad it is being trapped here 
you re not trapped here 
we just don t trust people 
no  you just don t trust me 
and then you expect me to trust you 
  why can t i have any freedom 
  because you can t 
that went great 
what is happening 
  she s 14 
  yeah 
you remember what that was like 
i do 
we can t keep her here forever 
if we don t figure this out  she s gonna
go a lot farther than the bridge 
if they find her 
we re never gonna see her again 
we gotta protect her  that s our job 
that s what we re gonna do 
protect her how 
by locking her inside 
she s got questions 
you know  questions we can t answer 
she wants to know who she is 
who charlotte lockwood was 
tracked grady to his house 
you were right  raptor s got a juvenile 
but listen  there s something else 
i found that girl you ve been after 
here you go 
thanks for coming 
wasn t sure who to call 
fish and wildlife didn t even want
to see it if it wasn t a dinosaur 
yeah  well 
they get all the attention 
you guys want to vary
the sampling plots
a hundred yards each 
these your students 
yeah  we ve been looking into the impact
of industrial farming on the environment 
so  this is right up our alley 
they hit 60 fields
in the county 
you seen anything like
this before 
no  not like this 
they ve been leaving degraded fields
all across the midwest 
first these big companies try to kill off
all the insects  now this 
is that your land 
that s the bennetts  corn 
the locusts didn t eat that 
you plant the same seed
as the bennet is 
no 
we re independent 
they use biosyn seed 
yeah  i bet they do 
you say you caught a live one 
kids  this is dr  ellie sattler 
she s a scientist from the university 
a bug scientist 
uh  sort of 
i study plants from a long time ago 
and that helps me figure out
how to protect plants and soil now 
wow  look at that 
pretty cool  huh 
this is called a field sequencer 
and it helps me read dna
everywhere i am 
i m gonna put this swab in his mouth 
good job 
and now  i need to take your little buddy
on a road trip 
where are you taking it 
i need a second opinion 
  hey  madeline 
  yeah 
we just gotta clean out
this little cylinder 
okay  let her down slow 
  got it 
  yeah 
easy 
let s start padding that other side 
just about there  i m on it 
why do we dig 
because paleontology is science 
and science is about the truth 
and there is truth in these rocks 
stop 
it says here
that the t  rex had a tiny brain 
well  it turns out that t  rex
was way smarter than we thought 
capable of memory  of loyalty 
that s a t  rex 
they ve been around
since  like  the  90s 
i don t get why we re here
digging up bones 
it just seems kinda random 
right 
grant 
you re gonna want to see this 
guys  can you help me 
i ll pack it out 
i ll make sure nobody else crosses it 
ellie sattler 
alan grant 
you look the same 
and this place  it s so   
so  uh    you 
i m sorry  if i d known
you were coming  i would ve   
uh   
can i get you something 
a beer or   
um  well  maybe not at 10 00 a m  
but iced tea or   
tea  yeah 
tea  i can do that 
saw a lot of tourists
on the way in 
well  the funding s dried up 
so somebody s gotta pay for all this 
right  thank you 
i read your articles about soil science
and regenerative farming 
that s great 
thanks 
gave me grounds
for some hope for a change 
and the one about growing algae 
mmm  alan  it s amazing 
it s a totally viable
carbon neutral fuel 
it s incredible  our answers
are in our oceans and in our soil 
sure  it s gonna take work 
but we re on the verge of extinction 
my god  what are we gonna do 
just sit around 
not on my watch 
what 
no  nothing  i just   
just like listening to you is all 
so  you re here on your own 
yeah  yeah  on my own 
how are your kids 
mmm 
amazing  grown  it s shocking 
they re both in college 
can you believe that 
and mark 
it s over 
oh 
oh  i m sorry to hear that 
it s okay 
i m back to me 
and my work  you know  it s   
that s great 
it s good  it is  i m alone at last 
exciting times 
yeah  i m living the alan grant life 
  it s just   
  can be lonely 
   so freeing 
ellie 
you didn t come out all this way
just to catch up  now  did you 
well  that s a locust 
mandibles  wings  thorax  but   
god  the size of it is massive 
it has genes that have been extinct
since the cretaceous 
and swarms of them are decimating crops
from iowa to texas 
terrifying  right 
started as a few hundred 
there could be millions
by the end of the summer 
if they keep going  there ll be
no grain to feed chickens  cattle 
the entire food chain
would collapse 
well  it s clearly designed 
but why would anyone do that 
none of the crops they re eating
are biosyn seed 
biosyn 
you re saying biosyn made this 
i mean  it would not shock me that they
wanna control the world s food supply 
not before a few million starve 
yeah  what is that saying 
how we re three meals away from anarchy 
if we don t stop them 
you can pick your last three meals 
so  why are you bringing it to me 
i need concrete evidence
biosyn s responsible for all this 
i need to go to their sanctuary
and get dna from another locust there 
but i need a witness 
alan 
you command respect 
people believe you 
ellie 
you know why i m here 
it s quiet  i m done with all that 
are you  okay 
well  i m sorry  alan 
nobody gets that luxury anymore 
not even you 
and you know what 
you re the one i trust 
this biosyn sanctuary is  what 
a hundred miles from anywhere 
how do you even get in there 
i got an invite
from their in house philosopher 
seems there s a lot of money
in being a chaotician these days 
and he just happened
to invite you out of the blue 
he said there were things i d wanna see 
uh huh 
you coming or what 
it s clear 
keep it going  that s good 
every animal captured
on the mainland comes through here
before shipping out
to biosyn s sanctuary in the dolomites 
we give them medical attention
and make sure they leave healthy 
so much security 
those are just the ones you see 
a lot of shady types out there
want these guys 
  hey 
  your plane s just fueling up 
biosyn s a tough invite 
you guys must know somebody 
  do you mind if i   
  of course 
hello 
you see me 
you follow me 
we rescued these guys
from an illegal breeding farm
in nevada a few weeks ago 
shut the whole place down 
anonymous tip 
good girl  yes  yes 
alan  you never get used to it 
okay  we re good  close it up 
  take care 
  thank you  bye 
okay 
hey 
you look just like blue 
this 
you wanna try it 
okay 
huh 
maisie  don t move 
hey  girl 
staying out of trouble 
she had a baby  that s impossible 
  back up 
  she won t hurt us  right 
you re damn right she will 
just breathe 
  if you don t  she ll think you re scared 
  i am scared 
nah 
she doesn t need to know that 
her nest has got to be nearby 
maisie  get inside 
  i m coming with you 
  what did i just say 
  we gotta move 
  not yet  we need the girl 
hey  what s up 
wow 
maisie 
maisie 
mm mmm  mm mmm 
where you going 
you can t keep me here 
you re not my mother 
she s leaving the house 
get in the truck 
come on  let s go 
got it 
  tie it down 
  hold on 
come on  let s go 
  get in 
  come on 
let s get out of here 
who are you 
claire 
they found her 
what  who are they 
poachers  i ve seen them around 
leader s a real shit heel 
he must have recognized me 
followed me here 
  where is she 
  go get the truck 
oh  my god 
oh  god 
  owen 
  hey  no 
they took her kid too 
i am gonna get her back 
i promise you that 
come on 
i know who to call 
please  please  no  no 
this year  man 
what s next 
historically 
uh  darkness  blood  rain of fire 
i think frogs 
we re not gonna be around
for much longer anyway 
these locusts in nebraska
are about to wrap it up 
they re eating the corn  wheat 
basically all of our food
and our food s food 
so  we can say goodbye to this 
hello 
franklin  it s me  you at work 
okay  you re kind of
a subject of interest around here 
so i can t really be talking to you 
come on  i m in trouble 
i really need your help  please 
yeah  and i could lose my job 
and you know i m not qualified
to do anything else 
we re outside 
let me talk to him 
  that him 
  that s him 
name s rainn delacourt 
real piece of work 
what d he take 
something we care about
very much 
oh  shit  i told you somebody
would come looking for her 
you can t just take a person  claire 
  we had no choice 
  not in the eyes of the law 
this guy is not the law 
tell us how to find him 
where d you call me from 
we have a man on the inside
of delacourt s operation 
there s an exchange in malta
sometime tomorrow  cash for cargo 
was she with him 
there s no mention 
but we have people on the ground already 
one of them you know 
a lot of us got recruited by the cia
after the park went down 
barry s french intelligence now 
i need to talk to him 
you can t just call him 
he s deep cover 
look  once we make
the bust in malta 
our guys will see
if delacourt knows where she is 
our guys  not you 
promise me you won t go in there
with your vest and mess everything up 
why would i do that 
look  you guys are both crazy 
but you seem like you re good parents 
or whatever you re trying to be 
she s lucky to have you 
don t get killed  okay 
i think we re almost there 
yeah 
dr  sattler  dr  grant 
  ramsay cole  communications 
  oh  hey 
i have to warn you 
everyone s so excited to have you 
you guys are absolute legends
around here 
mmm  you must be confusing us
with somebody else 
you know  it s great that you guys
are still so close with dr  malcolm 
i mean  sometimes you meet your heroes
and they disappoint you 
but he s exactly the way
you d want him to be 
i mean  such motility of thought 
it s incredible 
how much time
have you spent with him 
uh  well  i know that was sarcastic 
but honestly  not enough 
oh  please  after you 
and watch your head 
biosyn bought this land
for the amber deposits back in the  90s 
but we ve managed
to turn it into a safe haven
for about 20 displaced species 
first generation came from sorna 
most of the nublar dinosaurs are here too 
took fish and wildlife three years
to catch the t  rex 
  the   
  the t  rex is here 
oh  yeah  yeah 
arrived just before you guys 
aerial deterrent system  active 
restricted air space 
protects the airborne life 
keeps the pterosaurs below 500 feet 
airborne 
is that dreadnoughtus 
what 
beautiful  right 
the name means  fear nothing  
well  i guess you know that 
  what do they graze on 
  hawthorn and fern 
all indigenous  nothing stocked
except for the deer population 
it s a great mezzanine species
for the apex predator 
the apex predator 
giganotosaurus 
at least for now 
you don t let people in there  right 
uh  no  our    our research   
our research outposts are connected
completely underground 
if we have to 
we can just herd the animals remotely
using a neuro implant that sends
electrical signals directly to the brain 
like shocks 
uh    n no  like signals 
doesn t it strike you as a little bit   
  cruel 
  cruel 
do you know how much voltage was
in the electric fences at jurassic park 
yeah 
please join dr  ian malcolm
at noon in the lecture hall
for the ethics of genetic power 
god  everyone s so young 
well  it is part of our ethos
to attract the best and brightest 
doctors 
respected  renowned dr  sattler 
dr  grant  hi 
wow  this is big  i m lewis 
  dodgson  yeah 
  hi 
  you re lewis dodgson 
  i am  how do you do 
we didn t expect
to actually see you here 
well  i wouldn t be anywhere else 
  would you 
  no 
i mean  the people you see here
are changing the world 
would you mind if we  um   
  just to    it would mean a lot 
  oh 
do you wanna  um   
  oh  great  thank you so much 
  oh 
  that s good  that s good  thanks 
  okay 
so  you are going to see
some remarkable things today 
we are unlocking the true power
of the genome 
we re this close  believe me 
you ll make a fortune with that 
no  it s not about money 
no  we ve already identified dozens
of applications for paleo dna 
we re talking about cancer 
alzheimer s  autoimmune 
we will be saving lives 
  but    shh 
  i bet 
um  anyway  i wish i could
take you around myself  but  uh  it s   
so  you re in more than capable hands
with ramsay 
he s basically a young me 
only smarter and  uh  taller 
do you have food 
  like  one of my bars 
  pardon  um   
no  never mind 
i i ll find something 
so  i want to do more of this
later on  if we  um   
oh  we booked you
a private pod   
  right 
     for the trip out  so   
it s beautiful  you ll love it 
through the caverns and everything 
you better hurry  malcolm s on 
he s a bit of a contrarian 
but i like him 
he keeps us on our toes  anyway 
thank you for being here  it s   
okay  um  follow me  please 
what 
human beings have no more right
to safety or liberty
than any other creature
on this planet 
we not only lack dominion over nature 
we re subordinate to it 
and now  here we are
with the opportunity to rewrite life
at our fingertips 
and just like nuclear power 
nobody knew what to expect
with genetic engineering 
but they pressed the button
and hoped for the best 
just like you are doing now 
yep  you 
you control the future
of our survival on planet earth 
according to you 
the solution is genetic power 
but that same power
could devastate the food supply 
create new diseases 
alter the climate even further 
unforeseen consequences occur 
and every time  every single time   
we all act surprised 
because deep down 
i don t think that any of us actually
believe that these dangers are real 
in order to instigate
revolutionary change 
we must transform human consciousness 
whoo 
yeah 
  may am 
  dr  malcolm 
very good  there you go 
i don t want to be rude
to my friends  thank you 
catch me on my way out 
thanks  everybody 
look at you 
and look at me  and look at you 
wha    this is so trippy 
you look like you re doing well 
well  i got five kids  you know 
whom i adore more than life itself  so   
expenses add up 
you  alan  are you   
you have any family or   
  no 
  so  i need to talk to you 
yeah  i need to talk to you too 
privately 
do you two talk a lot 
  he slid into my dms 
  he did what 
  it s urgent  ian 
  what did you do 
seven minutes to midnight stuff 
the doomsday clock might be
about out of time 
but  as they say  it s always darkest
just before eternal nothingness 
what 
locusts altered with cretaceous era dna 
  that s not my field 
  but if these things continue to multiply 
we re talking about
cascading system wide effects  ian 
gosh  that s a drag 
  what is the matter with you 
   drag  
why  is there something special
you wanted me to do 
  how about give a damn 
  you know too much not to care 
hey  i gave my opinion
robustly for years 
as expected  the sum of our human
endeavors has led to our annihilation 
and the only play now
is to take the time we have left and  uh   
you know 
just like we always do  squander it 
honestly  ian  that s bullshit 
can i offer you guys some joe 
tyler  please  two cappuccinos 
i don t want a cappuccino 
i could do  like  a cortado
or macchiato   
trust me  it s real tough  that jet lag 
this is gonna perk you right up 
the locusts are part of a larger project
called hexapod allies 
  i   
  you re right about their intent 
i started hearing rumors
six weeks ago 
i read your piece on decadence
and put two and two together 
  i was not raising my voice 
  you re beginning to  it s crescendoing 
they re proliferating wildly 
they re lasting three 
four times longer than they should 
and all my models are pointing
toward a global ecological collapse  ian 
downstairs  sublevel six 
that s where they keep
the locusts 
look for a lab marked l4 
but wait  how are we
gonna get down there 
this looks so silky 
may i touch this blouse  by any chance 
sure 
you know what it is 
don t tell me  this is   
  you won t know it 
     sustainable bamboo 
  it is sustainable bamboo 
  that s why i said   
  how d you know 
  i just know 
  it s amazing 
  very amazing 
i ve got cumin  cinnamon 
i ve got allspice 
which is not very popular 
  i ve got five spice   
  doctor 
   if you re into that kind of feel 
  um  and let s talk milks 
  yeah 
okay  soy milk  yes 
  no 
  what just happened 
we re in 
sublevel six  restricted 
lewis  you re not listening to me 
the locusts  prehistoric dna has made them
stronger than they should be 
they re multiplying like crazy
and they re not dying 
  what part of this don t you understand 
  i do understand 
this is gonna be a global famine 
hey  hey 
we can t anticipate everything 
we need to eradicate the ones we released 
  what 
  all of them 
  no  no 
  like   
  henry  we don t want to cause a panic 
  like yesterday 
we want control 
there s no such thing 
when we re afraid 
what do we do 
what have we done before 
we follow through 
that s what we do 
right 
right 
we found the girl 
she s en route 
  cost me a fortune 
  what 
  wait  you found her 
  yeah  found them both 
her and the little raptor 
blue reproduced all on her own 
just like you said 
you re so smart  henry 
that s why this works 
you understand the value
of these creatures 
you always have 
i do too 
we don t stop because of a  what 
little side project went south 
hey  if they trace the locusts back to us 
they come for the dinosaurs 
all your work  gone 
billions of dollars in assets  gone 
diamonds with no one to mine them 
you really think
she s the solution 
okay 
everything involving the girl
goes through me  right 
is she all right 
she better be 
she s the most valuable
intellectual property on the planet 
i said i d call you 
they land yet 
second plane is incoming 
  who said anything about a second plane 
  we flew them separately 
i m not taking any chances

what 
do you remember how we used
to get the raptors in the truck 
  yeah 
  yeah

now 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
freeze 
i m flying us out of here 
tell me where you wanna be dropped 
you ever flown to biosyn 
owen  they took her to biosyn 
there s an airfield
on the north side of the island 
go 
you re under arrest  stay where you are 
right 
heads up 
we made a lot of enemies today 
we gotta go 
  he ll be here

come on 
hold on tight 
oh  sh

i don t know 
am i  am i 
let me see 
  is it    is it cut 
  no  no 
no  you re okay 
  okay 
  you re okay 
kayla watts 
you re welcome 
you don t look like you fly for biosyn 
i m gonna take that the way you meant it
and not the way it sounded 
i fly for whoever got a bag 
but we ll call this one a favor 
those don t work  they broke 
i ll take you all to biosyn 
but i can t promise it won t be dangerous 
you re willing to risk your life
for people you never met 
you wanna ask questions 
or you want a ride 
we ll take the ride 
so this is
our habitat development lab 
a lot of exciting discoveries
as of late 
we ve brought back numerous species
in their purest form 
and i mean complete  untouched genomes 
like moros intrepidus 
  what 
  yeah 
wow 
what about splicing dna 
you know  creating new species 
oh  no  dr  sattler 
we don t do that here 
we like to think we re more evolved 
looks like we still have
some time left before your ride 
uh  would you guys like to tour
the facilities yourselves 
oh  uh  i mean  we could 
  yeah  why not 
  great 
i ll meet you guys at the hyperloop 
station three in about 30 minutes 
elevators are down this hall 
not those 
those lead you
down to the sublevels 
you need special clearance
to get down there 
  oh  okay 
  thirty minutes 
here  take this 
okay 
yep 
i m really sorry
that it had to happen this way 
yep  that s what kidnappers say 
claire should never have
hidden you away 
you re way too important  maisie 
you took her too 
yeah 
we needed her
to help us understand you 
hey  beta 
you okay 
did you say  beta   is that her name 
i gave it to her 
beta is pretty special 
you know  when we made blue 
we used monitor lizard dna
to fill in the gaps in her genome 
monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate 
so beta and blue
are genetically identical 
and that s what they have
in common with you and   
charlotte 
what do you know about charlotte 
she died 
a long time ago 
it broke my grandpa s heart 
so he made me 
no  maisie  actually  he didn t 
charlotte made you 
i m so excited for everyone to see
what we ve been doing here 
there s new technology being made 
new science  like  every day almost 
and it s great to be in the center of   
center of that 
charlotte lived on site b
with all of us till the storm 
she loved dinosaurs 
  charlotte  be careful 
  yeah  i will 
she grew up around scientists 
and eventually   
she became one herself 
a butterfly flew
info my office this morning 
they say tiny things have huge impacts 
and i agree wholeheartedly 
she was brilliant 
for all my work with creatures 
wings flapping   
in ways that i ll never be 
in the metaphysics of identity 
can a replica truly be the original 
and if it s possible  what makes it so 
i ve lost my pen 
is that me 
yeah 
just like blue  charlotte was able
to have a child all by herself 
she created you with her own dna 
so i do have a mother 
your grandfather didn t want
anyone to know the truth 
he was protecting her  and you 
and we re the same 
you were 
when you were a baby  charlotte started
to show symptoms of a genetic disorder 
that s how she died 
she didn t know she had it
until after you were born 
  do i have it too 
  no 
she changed your dna 
she altered every cell in your body
to eradicate this disease 
no one on earth has ever known
how to do that 
she fixed me 
charlotte s discovery
is a part of you now 
your dna could change the world 
and i have to know how she did it 
but i just can t replicate her work 
if i could just study you and beta 
whose dna was never changed  i could   
fix a terrible mistake that i ve made 
what kind of mistake 
sublevel six  restricted 
thanks for coming 
  which lab did malcolm say 
  l4 
this is it 
okay  get in 
get the sample and get out 
and move slow 
they can swarm
at the slightest disturbance 
orthoptera 
two weeks 
fully mature  this one 
ready  easy 
okay  go 
what 
go get it 
is that necessary 
wh what did you think was gonna happen 
i have to take a sample 
we need concrete evidence  this is it 
alan  you said there was no time 
can you get it 
of course i can get it 
okay  easy 
watch its legs 
ugh  yech 
here we go 
they re cell signaling between them 
this is not good  ellie 
i almost got it 
how does she remain an asset  henry 
if you re incriminating both of us
by showing her classified things
on the computer 
charlotte lockwood believed
the methods used at jurassic park
could cure disease 
she was right 
having filled the gaps
in maisie s genome with altered dna 
she used a pathogen to deliver
the repaired sequence to every cell 
if i can repurpose what she did 
i could change the locust dna 
eradicating them in a single generation 
maisie and the baby raptor
will provide the missing data 
hey  do you wanna get out of here 
what the   
got it 
oh  my god 
they re everywhere  help me 
oh  god  no 
oh  my god  oh  my god 
maisie 
asset containment breach 
please remain at your stations 
asset containment breach 
please remain at your stations 
oh  my god 
  oh  god  i can t see 
  where s the key 
oh  god 
you okay 
yeah  you 
yeah 
oh 
you re dr  ellie sattler and alan grant 
you were at jurassic park 
what are you doing here 
what  what   
what are you doing here 
i m maisie lockwood 
uh  hey  we don t  uh   
we re not   
we don t work for biosyn 
i can tell 
  we gotta get out of here 
  yeah  we should go 
okay  in and out 
we find your girl and go 
tower  this is n141  request to land
for freight delivery  over 
n141  negative 
we ve been advised you re carrying
unauthorized passengers  over 
copy that  tower 
be advised shipment is perishable 
we need immediate clearance 
it s an emergency  over 
there isn t    no 
negative 
return to point of origin 
you seem to be breaking up 
are you hearing me on your side 
may need to check systems 
nice try  kayla 
they will down your bird 
who is this 
is this denise 
you do not want me to start spilling
secrets  denise  you remember dubrovnik 
she s   
different denise  in accounts 
talked to santos 
it s the girl s parents 
let s shut off the ads 
are you sure 
uh huh 
what s that 
uh   
that s the  uh   
that s the aerial deterrent system 
  keeps the airborne life away 
  why is it blinking 
dead ass denise in the tower
just turned it off 
we gotta get out of this airspace
right now 
  that s another plane  right 
  not exactly 
  is that a   
  quetzalcoatlus 
late cretaceous 
should have stayed there 
okay  okay 
it s cool  we re good  it s gone 
this plane is going down 
if you re gonna eject 
you need to do it now 
  i only got one chair  and she s in it 
  you don t have parachutes 
i wasn t expecting company 
claire  we gotta get you off this plane 
what 
the parachute is gonna open automatically 
if it doesn t  you pull this lever 
do you understand me 
claire 
if it doesn t open automatically 
you re gonna pull
this lever behind you  okay 
ten thousand feet 
hey  you re the one
who s gotta go to get to her 
you re her mom 
you re her only shot 
i ll see you again 
i love you 
what s the plan 
whatever happens  that s the plan 
  three 
  this way 
  alan  we need the code 
  let s try this thing 
yeah 
get down 
  thank god it s you 
  i know 
  this place is a maze 
  good you re here 
we were so confused 
i thought we were lost 
then you said station three 
and i was like  here   
do you have the sample 
  what 
  what are you talking about 
the dna sample  do you have it 
biosyn s responsible
for the locust epidemic 
dodgson s covering it up 
you were right 
i m here to help you 
do you have it 
yeah 
good 
this pod will take you
to the airfield 
we have a plane ready to fly 
  ian told you about hexapod allies 
  no 
i told him 
what 
  okay  you guys gotta go 
  wait 
maisie 
maisie lockwood 
go 
okay 
that was my baby 
okay  okay 
where d you learn to fly 
uh  air force 
legacy on my mama s side 
yeah  i m navy 
okay  so how d you end up doing this 
i was a legit contract pilot
for a grip 
but it didn t exactly pay enough
to be out here sending money home 
so i hit up a few contacts
for the more lucrative shady shit 
honestly  i might be done
with this line of work 
is that why you re helping us 
i was there
when they handed your girl off to biosyn 
i could have said something  but i didn t 
and when i saw her picture   
it isn t enough to do nothing 
thank you 
no 
nope 
what an asshole 
you good 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
yeah  i m not shook at all  you 
nah  nah  no 
ejection seat beacon 
we ll find her 
okay  okay 
you really love her  huh 
yeah 
i get it 
i like redheads too 
what  god 
  who is that 
  it s grant and sattler 
  is this live 
  twelve minutes ago 
we were tracking the escaped asset 
my guys missed it 
they stole a dna sample 
how d they get in there 
they used an access key 
yankee white clearance 
one of our cameras saw ian malcolm
put something in sattler s pocket 
all right 
i want to see him 
and get ramsay up here too 
will you 
  where are they now 
  on the way to the airfield 
they caught the hyperloop
right on schedule 
how are you 
you all right 
not really  no 
hey 
i  uh  knew your mom 
you did 
mm hmm 
yeah  a few years
after hammond died 
she came to my university to lecture 
and we became good friends 
what was she like 
brilliant 
light years ahead
of everybody else 
and she had a conscience 
while they were out
building theme parks 
well  she was determined to prove
that genetic power could save lives 
and i was her experiment 
no 
she wanted a child more than anything 
but she wanted you to have
what she couldn t 
a full life 
i didn t know her long 
but i know she loved you very much 
what s happening 
this must be the old amber mines 
we re inside the mountain 
they must ve made access doors
when they built these tunnels 
you ready 
i m good 
no  that s not reasonable 
you want to go into the dark tunnel 
i want to stay in the bulletproof tube 
who s being unreasonable 
but the bulletproof tube has no door 
look  uh   
i know how you feel 
it s    it s scary  it is 
but trust me  moving forward
is better than staying still 
and dr  sattler here is
a good person in a tight spot 
and this is a tight spot 
so  you coming 
all right 
hey  i heard the alarm 
everything all right 
yeah  no  no 
nothing we can t  uh  handle  listen   
  you rang 
  oh  good 
dr  malcolm  you are   
  fired 
  what 
it was such a cushy gig 
you can give your access key to security
if you still have it 
one of the hyperloop pods
just shut down in the amber mines 
what 
wow  this day 
uh  which    which pod are we   
are there  um   
dinosaurs in the mines 
there are dinosaurs everywhere 
technically  birds are dinosaurs 
g genetically speaking at least 
okay 
lewis  grant and sattler are in this pod 
  we need to send a security team asap 
  absolutely  ramsay  thank you 
let s all just stay in our lanes though 
we can take care of it 
thank you  doctor 
that s it  huh 
nothing else to see here 
uh  i m not sure
i admire your tone right now 
  you need to leave 
  yeah  i do 
but first 
i owe all these folks an apology 
i think that by lending my cachet
to this joint 
i might ve made it seem
as if biosyn wasn t rotten to the core 
that s enough  ian 
see  here s how they get you 
they give you so many promotions
in a short period of time
that it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking 
oh  my god 
then there are doors that you don t open 
things that you ignore 
but mainly  he s exploiting
your enchantment with these 
is there an actual concern here 
or are you just   
you re racing toward the extinction
of our species  and you don t care 
you know exactly what you re doing 
but you won t stop 
you can t 
i thought you might be different 
but you re just like everyone else 
you see what you want to see 
you imagine unchecked avarice 
so that s what you find 
you envision  what 
an evil  unbound prometheus 
  so that s what i am to you 
  prometheus got gored 
so will you  you rapacious rat bastard 
ramsay  will you help dr  malcolm
gather his things 
his room  and then to the airfield 
that s it 
dodgson 
allosaurus 
giganotosaurus 
largest known terrestrial carnivore 
he put two apex predators in one valley 
pretty soon there s only gonna be one 
did you feel that 
that s an air current 
must be an opening up ahead 
how old is this mine 
do you think 
just breathe 
nobody panic 
just watch out for bats 
  who said anything about bats 
  i hate bats 
well  there s probably no bats 
no falling rocks 
just a possibility of toxic gas 
dehydration  hypothermia 
just possibilities  nothing for certain 
i should ve left you where you were 
why did i bring you into this 
  you were happy in your element 
  what  what  ellie 
what 
i wasn t happy 
you weren t 
  do you guys have kids 
  what 
uh    no  i i do  two 
but not with him 
uh    no 
no  just old friends 
uh  just old friends 
really 
won t be long
before security knows you re gone 
a map  that looks like an old map 
you don t have a new map 
there s an access gate
at the northeast corner of the mine 
  if your friends make it out   
  if 
  when they make it out 
  yes  sir 
that s where they ll be 
these roads are protected  right 
uh  yeah  i d drive fast 
you did good 
yeah  well  actually 
it s a complete disaster  but thanks 
not yet 
lewis 
what  what are you doing down here 
actually  no  this is good 
you sent a rescue team
into the mines for grant and sattler 
yeah  what  okay  of course  yeah 
  are you deleting research files 
  uh  we are  yes 
you and i got to protect
what we ve built  right 
you think they wouldn t love
to get their hands in here 
take all the resources
i ve spent decades collecting 
just because  what 
we made a bad call  it happens 
seven 
hexapod allies 
what  oh 
okay  what do people know 
the locusts were designed to spread
genetic modifications to crops 
protection against droughts 
frost  disease  a breakthrough 
  goddamn right it was 
  yeah  only it didn t work 
you ensured they can t eat biosyn seed 
so they re eating everything else 
which i did not see coming 
we have a solution 
  independent farmers suffered at first 
  henry s on it 
nobody cared much  now the world s
food supply is verging on collapse 
find the girl  change the locusts  dna 
  the trail s gonna lead back to you 
  we solve the problem 
ramsay  thank you 
disappears in the next news cycle 
just like everything else  this is not it 
81c1 
or you could accept responsibility 
share your research with the world 
yep 
you know  i was 28 once  i get it 
you look around  you   
realize you re surrounded by injustice
and cruelty and you wanna change it 
yep 
and then you grow up 
somebody puts you in charge 
and you see that there is no changing it 
it s chomp or be chomped 
  where are you going with that 
  oh 
we don t apologize for our mistakes 
we erase them 
stay on your phone  i may need you 
watch yourself 
  ellie 
  yeah 
what was that 
be careful 
oh  my god  are you okay 
forget the hat 
come on 
go  go  go 
go  go  go  go  go 
there s no button 
it s a car 
  oh  my god  ian 
  ian  over here 
  help 
  please 
  open the gate 
  please help us 
  do you know the code 
  i didn t know there was gonna be a code 
i didn t know there was gonna be a code 
oh  my god 
oh  my god 
the brake 
pull the brake 
there are 10 000 possibilities 
push your legs against it 
  1984 
  come on  ian 
  kick up against it 
  hurry 
miles davis s birthday  0526 
  ian 
  please  please

come on  come on 
go on  get 
yuck 
hey 
oh  my god 
i thought you were dead 
what do they even eat 
we better get inside 
go ahead 
containment chamber compromised 
it s locked 
gonna need something heavy 
something sharp  or both 
that can t be right 
  is that   
  oh  no 
oh  my god 
he s burning the evidence 
  oh  my god  oh  my god  oh  my   
  that s bananas 
oh  my god 
i    i know that
this may seem precarious  but   
no  we re teetering

the regulations are clear
that in the event of a level two   
shh 
jeffrey 
god   
damn it 
just   
just call it 
attention  attention 
this is an immediate evacuation order 
remote herding system
is now active 
all living assets en route
to emergency containment 
i can t get hold of anybody
since everything is on fire 
  dr  sattler  get some water 
  oh  thanks 
dr  grant 
here you are 
i m owen grady 
big fan  i read your book 
well  book on tape 
owen grady  owen grady 
yeah  i know who you are 
you trained raptors 
i tried  yeah 
  how you doing

jurassic world  not a fan 
mm mmm 
okay 
so  we good to find a way out of here 
  yep 
  let s get it 
there s a helicopter
out in the main complex 
we turn the ads back on  we go home 
  wait  what s an ads 
  aerial deterrent system 
you know 
for the pterodactyls and shit 
keeps them away from the helicopters 
well  how do we turn it back on 
it looks like all the systems
run through to the control room 
which is on the third floor 
these outposts
are all connected underground 
all right  easy  rambo 
so you worked
in the raptor pen  huh 
yeah 
wow  and what happens 
do you just tell them what to do
and they comply  or   
well  it s a human animal bond
based on mutual respect 
mm hmm 
i had a dog once 
humped my leg so much
i got a callus on my shinbone 
that s a true story 
oh  god  hey  good 
here s what i m thinking 
we get started again 
you and me 
i can get money 
yeah  money s cheap these days 
wh what s the matter 
don t look so worried  there s   
there s opportunity in everything 
e even this  you ll learn that 
i ve been thinking 
maybe you take more of a lead now  okay 
you re ready  i think 
here  take   
what the hell
is the matter with you 
it was you 
you told malcolm
about the program  y you   
you set this whole thing up 
you set me up 
i gave you every opportunity
i did not have  i   
we have an understanding  ramsay 
and you do not break that 
i would not break this 
i m not you 
uh oh 
this is very bad 
this is the same system
we used at the park 
great  so we can turn on the thing
and then we all get out of here 
let s see  ads   
what s this  what s  error 99  
not enough power 
in a breakdown 
all available power is seized
by the primary system to keep running 
we need all that power
to reactivate the ads 
the system s safety feature
is what s gonna kill us 
of course 
  how do we get more power 
  we can t 
but we can redistribute what we have 
  just need to   
  shut down the primary system 
  yes  exactly 
  where is it 
  uh  next floor up 
  i m coming with you 
we escaped down here 
  where is that  water treatment center 
  hydroelectric system  sub eight 
give me eight minutes 
i could find her 
wait  who s this now 
beta  blue s baby 
velociraptor 
  what 
  a baby raptor 
you gave her a name 
how about that 
i made a promise
we would bring her home 
you made a promise
to a dinosaur

all living assets now in containment 
come on 
still get nightmares 
all the time 
you 
i have a lot of regrets 
oh  yeah 
well 
we hold on to regret 
we stay in the past 
what matters  i guess  is   
is what we do now 
  right 
  yeah 
ah 
okay 
nobody said there d be bugs 
b4  she s in here 
watch the sides 
they always come from the sides 
you know  at first we thought
they disembowel their prey  but no 
they re smart enough
to go straight for the throat 
the veins  the arteries 
sometimes both at the same time 
okay 
okay 
we ve got you 
it s right down that aisle 
it s right down that aisle where you are 
why are they skulking in

we re gonna figure this out  it s complex 
we don t have time for complex 
primary system compromised 
wait a minute  wait a minute 
aerial deterrent system active 
victory  victory 
damn  that felt good 
oh  come on 
what s your story 
wait 
at biosyn  we re dedicated to the idea
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves 
all right  kayla  we re good to go

charlotte lockwood changed every cell

today marks the first day of testimony
from biosyn whistleblower ramsay cole 
the senate will also hear from
doctors grant  sattler and malcolm 
who have been vocal in this debate
since the incident at jurassic park 
you look   
  uncomfortable 
     trustworthy 
yeah  not getting used to it 
let s finish this 
yeah 
dr  henry wu
has found an emergency solution
to the ecological crisis 
his use of a pathogen
to alter the locusts  dna
has revolutionized modern genetics 
he attributed the discovery
to another scientist  charlotte lockwood 
who died nearly 13 years ago 
by un decree  biosyn valley
has been designated a global sanctuary 
the animals will live there free 
safe from the outside world 
  money 
  money 
thank you 
life on earth has existed
for hundreds of millions of years 
and dinosaurs were only a part of that 
and we re an even smaller part of that 
they really put us in perspective 
the idea that life on earth
existed 65 million years ago   
it s humbling 
we act like we re alone here 
but we re not 
we re part of a fragile system
