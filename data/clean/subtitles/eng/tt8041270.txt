keep it steady
damn i dont see it do you see it
settle down kid she cant run forever
dinosaurs are in our world
and with every confrontation we learn
more about this frightening new reality
how did we get here
oh my god
its been three decades
since the deadly events at jurassic park
and weve yet to find a way
for these animals to live safely among us
after the devastating eruption
of isla nublars longdormant volcano
those who survived were transported
to the mainland
many of the larger predators
were captured
but the remaining creatures
scattered here
in big rock national park
while most remained in the wild
those who made their way to civilization
struggled to adapt
to unfamiliar conditions
local authorities have warned
the animals are unpredictable
and when hungry extremely violent
as the dinosaurs spread across borders
a global black market has risen
theyre not ours
go on you sad pathetic loser
to combat the growing threat
of illegal poachers
the us congress awarded
sole collection rights
to the global giant biosyn genetics
at biosyn were dedicated to the idea
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves
ceo lewis dodgson has created
a sanctuary in italys dolomite mountains
where he hopes to study
the dinosaurs ancient immune systems
for unique pharmaceutical properties
while biosyn believes
we can handle genetic power responsibly
the public remains skeptical
some note these government contracts have
led to massive spikes in biosyns profits
and rumors persist of a human clone
who mysteriously disappeared
leading to a worldwide search
some believe shes genetically identical
to charlotte lockwood
deceased daughter of jurassic park
cofounder benjamin lockwood
now that we brought these animals
back from extinction
can we face the consequences
are we responsible for them
or should they be left
to fend for themselves
as we adapt to an everchanging world
we must find answers to these questions
for their safely as well as for our own
let it go
hold on
we are inside
the illegal breeding facility
the juveniles are kept in cages
to keep costs down
its medieval
claire
why do you think hes separated
from the rest
i dont think hes gonna make it
no what are you doing
we could report this
the dfw takes days to investigate
we can save this one now
its okay its okay buddy
okay here we go
nope no
lift
okay
support the head
yeah
okay yeah
hurry up
check the right side
with me
go go go
okay come on
come on lets go
hold on
to what
shit
claire were gonna get shot
no claire no no claire
oh god
oh shit
everybody good
no
no
okay okay so i think
we get this one to the dfw
and then we hit them again
yeah yeah you saw
that breeding ground right
were done
i got a call last week
its a real job something i can do
to effectively change things
i gotta take it
they need us
are you saving these dinosaurs
because they need us
or are you saving them
to absolve yourself
claire
i mean this is crazy
claire
youre doing the right thing
but this this isnt the way
to go about it anymore
honestly you need someone
whos good at being shot at
arent you and owen still
like a weird thing
its not that weird
he didnt mean weird
mmmmm
no
uh he meant like surprising
hyah
lets bring em home
hyah
hyah
no
okay come here
okay
hey hey
were gonna get you
someplace safe
hey
there you go
there you go
yeah
shit
poachings three to five
yall know that
looks like well be
taking that animal off your hands
like hell you will
all right seems our friend
dont recognize the badge
department of fish and wildlife
were rounding up that dinosaur
for its own safety
thats funny
cause my friends here
they typically know all the new recruits
shep do you remember meeting these guys
in orientation or not
nope
dinosaur bone powder goes for what
3000 an ounce
makes this animal here worth about
shoot 500000
how yall want this to go huh
your bones aint worth nothing to me
hey brother
he aint lying
ill see you around
never seen you walk away
from a fight before
yeah
i got obligations
shouldnt you be in school
im homeschooled
that so
and wheres home
i dont know
whoa
better not stand there man
holy crap
what in the world man
so the dinosaurs
hey
where you been
nowhere
what are you burning
oh nothing just some old blankets
you sure you didnt go past the bridge
thats the look you give me
when you think im lying
well are you
no
maisie youre literally looking
everywhere but here
i said i didnt go past the bridge
maisie
can we start over
i know claire there are people out there
wholl do anything to find me
im not angry
that means you dont have to be angry
im not angry
i can take care of myself
hey
its okay for us to depend on each other
thats what people do
how would i know what people do
the only people ive spoken to
in the past four years are you both
besides
im not even a real person anyway
what
i was made from someone else
im not me
you are the only you who ever was
what
nno
was that like really corny
it was so corny
can we keep that between us
cant promise that
hey kid
hello
sorry im late
aw
you smell like horses
mmm
oh you like that do ya
i do yeah
oh
okay um
im gonna make dinner
everything okay
she went into town again
ah this kid
did you talk to her
i tried
ill talk to her
slow breaths take your time
hey cut away from yourself
whoa
wanna know how to win
a knife fight
you gotta let yourself get cut
make sure theyre cutting
something dispensable
while youre cutting something vital
and then say something cool like
wrong girl wrong time
wrong girl wrong time
whoo
stonecold
right
i would not mess with her
no way
listen we should probably
talk about you going into town
i dont
i dont think you understand
how bad it is being trapped here
youre not trapped here
we just dont trust people
no you just dont trust me
and then you expect me to trust you
why cant i have any freedom
because you cant
that went great
what is happening
shes 14
yeah
you remember what that was like
i do
we cant keep her here forever
if we dont figure this out shes gonna
go a lot farther than the bridge
if they find her
were never gonna see her again
we gotta protect her thats our job
thats what were gonna do
protect her how
by locking her inside
shes got questions
you know questions we cant answer
she wants to know who she is
who charlotte lockwood was
tracked grady to his house
you were right raptors got a juvenile
but listen theres something else
i found that girl youve been after
here you go
thanks for coming
wasnt sure who to call
fish and wildlife didnt even want
to see it if it wasnt a dinosaur
yeah well
they get all the attention
you guys want to vary
the sampling plots
a hundred yards each
these your students
yeah weve been looking into the impact
of industrial farming on the environment
so this is right up our alley
they hit 60 fields
in the county
you seen anything like
this before
no not like this
theyve been leaving degraded fields
all across the midwest
first these big companies try to kill off
all the insects now this
is that your land
thats the bennetts corn
the locusts didnt eat that
you plant the same seed
as the bennet is
no
were independent
they use biosyn seed
yeah i bet they do
you say you caught a live one
kids this is dr ellie sattler
shes a scientist from the university
a bug scientist
uh sort of
i study plants from a long time ago
and that helps me figure out
how to protect plants and soil now
wow look at that
pretty cool huh
this is called a field sequencer
and it helps me read dna
everywhere i am
im gonna put this swab in his mouth
good job
and now i need to take your little buddy
on a road trip
where are you taking it
i need a second opinion
hey madeline
yeah
we just gotta clean out
this little cylinder
okay let her down slow
got it
yeah
easy
lets start padding that other side
just about there im on it
why do we dig
because paleontology is science
and science is about the truth
and there is truth in these rocks
stop
it says here
that the t rex had a tiny brain
well it turns out that t rex
was way smarter than we thought
capable of memory of loyalty
thats a t rex
theyve been around
since like the 90s
i dont get why were here
digging up bones
it just seems kinda random
right
grant
youre gonna want to see this
guys can you help me
ill pack it out
ill make sure nobody else crosses it
ellie sattler
alan grant
you look the same
and this place its so
so uh you
im sorry if id known
you were coming i wouldve
uh
can i get you something
a beer or
um well maybe not at 1000 am
but iced tea or
tea yeah
tea i can do that
saw a lot of tourists
on the way in
well the fundings dried up
so somebodys gotta pay for all this
right thank you
i read your articles about soil science
and regenerative farming
thats great
thanks
gave me grounds
for some hope for a change
and the one about growing algae
mmm alan its amazing
its a totally viable
carbonneutral fuel
its incredible our answers
are in our oceans and in our soil
sure its gonna take work
but were on the verge of extinction
my god what are we gonna do
just sit around
not on my watch
what
no nothing i just
just like listening to you is all
so youre here on your own
yeah yeah on my own
how are your kids
mmm
amazing grown its shocking
theyre both in college
can you believe that
and mark
its over
oh
oh im sorry to hear that
its okay
im back to me
and my work you know its
thats great
its good it is im alone at last
exciting times
yeah im living the alan grant life
its just
can be lonely
so freeing
ellie
you didnt come out all this way
just to catch up now did you
well thats a locust
mandibles wings thorax but
god the size of it is massive
it has genes that have been extinct
since the cretaceous
and swarms of them are decimating crops
from iowa to texas
terrifying right
started as a few hundred
there could be millions
by the end of the summer
if they keep going therell be
no grain to feed chickens cattle
the entire food chain
would collapse
well its clearly designed
but why would anyone do that
none of the crops theyre eating
are biosyn seed
biosyn
youre saying biosyn made this
i mean it would not shock me that they
wanna control the worlds food supply
not before a few million starve
yeah what is that saying
how were three meals away from anarchy
if we dont stop them
you can pick your last three meals
so why are you bringing it to me
i need concrete evidence
biosyns responsible for all this
i need to go to their sanctuary
and get dna from another locust there
but i need a witness
alan
you command respect
people believe you
ellie
you know why im here
its quiet im done with all that
are you okay
well im sorry alan
nobody gets that luxury anymore
not even you
and you know what
youre the one i trust
this biosyn sanctuary is what
a hundred miles from anywhere
how do you even get in there
i got an invite
from their inhouse philosopher
seems theres a lot of money
in being a chaotician these days
and he just happened
to invite you out of the blue
he said there were things id wanna see
uhhuh
you coming or what
its clear
keep it going thats good
every animal captured
on the mainland comes through here
before shipping out
to biosyns sanctuary in the dolomites
we give them medical attention
and make sure they leave healthy
so much security
those are just the ones you see
a lot of shady types out there
want these guys
hey
your planes just fueling up
biosyns a tough invite
you guys must know somebody
do you mind if i
of course
hello
you see me
you follow me
we rescued these guys
from an illegal breeding farm
in nevada a few weeks ago
shut the whole place down
anonymous tip
good girl yes yes
alan you never get used to it
okay were good close it up
take care
thank you bye
okay
hey
you look just like blue

oh my god
oh god
owen
hey no
they took her kid too
i am gonna get her back
i promise you that
come on
i know who to call
please please no no
this year man
whats next
historically
uh darkness blood rain of fire
i think frogs
were not gonna be around
for much longer anyway
these locusts in nebraska
are about to wrap it up
theyre eating the corn wheat
basically all of our food
and our foods food
so we can say goodbye to this
hello
franklin its me you at work
okay youre kind of
a subject of interest around here
so i cant really be talking to you
come on im in trouble
i really need your help please
yeah and i could lose my job
and you know im not qualified
to do anything else
were outside
let me talk to him
that him
thats him
names rainn delacourt
real piece of work
whatd he take
something we care about
very much
oh shit i told you somebody
would come looking for her
you cant just take a person claire
we had no choice
not in the eyes of the law
this guy is not the law
tell us how to find him
whered you call me from
we have a man on the inside
of delacourts operation
theres an exchange in malta
sometime tomorrow cash for cargo
was she with him
theres no mention
but we have people on the ground already
one of them you know
a lot of us got recruited by the cia
after the park went down
barrys french intelligence now
i need to talk to him
you cant just call him
hes deep cover
look once we make
the bust in malta
our guys will see
if delacourt knows where she is
our guys not you
promise me you wont go in there
with your vest and mess everything up
why would i do that
look you guys are both crazy
but you seem like youre good parents
or whatever youre trying to be
shes lucky to have you
dont get killed okay
i think were almost there
yeah
dr sattler dr grant
ramsay cole communications
oh hey
i have to warn you
everyones so excited to have you
you guys are absolute legends
around here
mmm you must be confusing us
with somebody else
you know its great that you guys
are still so close with dr malcolm
i mean sometimes you meet your heroes
and they disappoint you
but hes exactly the way
youd want him to be
i mean such motility of thought
its incredible
how much time
have you spent with him
uh well i know that was sarcastic
but honestly not enough
oh please after you
and watch your head
biosyn bought this land
for the amber deposits back in the 90s
but weve managed
to turn it into a safe haven
for about 20 displaced species
first generation came from sorna
most of the nublar dinosaurs are here too
took fish and wildlife three years
to catch the t rex
the
the t rex is here
oh yeah yeah
arrived just before you guys
aerial deterrent system active
restricted air space
protects the airborne life
keeps the pterosaurs below 500 feet
airborne
is that dreadnoughtus
what
beautiful right
the name means fear nothing
well i guess you know that
what do they graze on
hawthorn and fern
all indigenous nothing stocked
except for the deer population
its a great mezzanine species
for the apex predator
the apex predator
giganotosaurus
at least for now
you dont let people in there right
uh no our our research
our research outposts are connected
completely underground
if we have to
we can just herd the animals remotely
using a neuroimplant that sends
electrical signals directly to the brain
like shocks
uh nno like signals
doesnt it strike you as a little bit
cruel
cruel
do you know how much voltage was
in the electric fences at jurassic park
yeah
please join dr ian malcolm
at noon in the lecture hall
for the ethics of genetic power
god everyones so young
well it is part of our ethos
to attract the best and brightest
doctors
respected renowned dr sattler
dr grant hi
wow this is big im lewis
dodgson yeah
hi
youre lewis dodgson
i am how do you do
we didnt expect
to actually see you here
well i wouldnt be anywhere else
would you
no
i mean the people you see here
are changing the world
would you mind if we um
just to it would mean a lot
oh
do you wanna um
oh great thank you so much
oh
thats good thats good thanks
okay
so you are going to see
some remarkable things today
we are unlocking the true power
of the genome
were this close believe me
youll make a fortune with that
no its not about money
no weve already identified dozens
of applications for paleodna
were talking about cancer
alzheimers autoimmune
we will be saving lives
but shh
i bet
um anyway i wish i could
take you around myself but uh its
so youre in morethancapable hands
with ramsay
hes basically a young me
only smarter and uh taller
do you have food
like one of my bars
pardon um
no never mind
iill find something
so i want to do more of this
later on if we um
oh we booked you
a private pod
right
for the trip out so
its beautiful youll love it
through the caverns and everything
you better hurry malcolms on
hes a bit of a contrarian
but i like him
he keeps us on our toes anyway
thank you for being here its
okay um follow me please
what
human beings have no more right
to safety or liberty
than any other creature
on this planet
we not only lack dominion over nature
were subordinate to it
and now here we are
with the opportunity to rewrite life
at our fingertips
and just like nuclear power
nobody knew what to expect
with genetic engineering
but they pressed the button
and hoped for the best
just like you are doing now
yep you
you control the future
of our survival on planet earth
according to you
the solution is genetic power
but that same power
could devastate the food supply
create new diseases
alter the climate even further
unforeseen consequences occur
and every time every single time
we all act surprised
because deep down
i dont think that any of us actually
believe that these dangers are real
in order to instigate
revolutionary change
we must transform human consciousness
whoo
yeah
may am
dr malcolm
very good there you go
i dont want to be rude
to my friends thank you
catch me on my way out
thanks everybody
look at you
and look at me and look at you
wha this is so trippy
you look like youre doing well
well i got five kids you know
whom i adore more than life itself so
expenses add up
you alan are you
you have any family or
no
so i need to talk to you
yeah i need to talk to you too
privately
do you two talk a lot
he slid into my dms
he did what
its urgent ian
what did you do
seven minutes to midnight stuff
the doomsday clock might be
about out of time
but as they say its always darkest
just before eternal nothingness
what
locusts altered with cretaceousera dna
thats not my field
but if these things continue to multiply
were talking about
cascading systemwide effects ian
gosh thats a drag
what is the matter with you
drag
why is there something special
you wanted me to do
how about give a damn
you know too much not to care
hey i gave my opinion
robustly for years
as expected the sum of our human
endeavors has led to our annihilation
and the only play now
is to take the time we have left and uh
you know
just like we always do squander it
honestly ian thats bullshit
can i offer you guys some joe
tyler please two cappuccinos
i dont want a cappuccino
i could do like a cortado
or macchiato
trust me its real tough that jet lag
this is gonna perk you right up
the locusts are part of a larger project
called hexapod allies
i
youre right about their intent
i started hearing rumors
six weeks ago
i read your piece on decadence
and put two and two together
i was not raising my voice
youre beginning to its crescendoing
theyre proliferating wildly
theyre lasting three
four times longer than they should
and all my models are pointing
toward a global ecological collapse ian
downstairs sublevel six
thats where they keep
the locusts
look for a lab marked l4
but wait how are we
gonna get down there
this looks so silky
may i touch this blouse by any chance
sure
you know what it is
dont tell me this is
you wont know it
sustainable bamboo
it is sustainable bamboo
thats why i said
howd you know
i just know
its amazing
very amazing
ive got cumin cinnamon
ive got allspice
which is not very popular
ive got fivespice
doctor
if youre into that kind of feel
um and lets talk milks
yeah
okay soy milk yes
no
what just happened
were in
sublevel six restricted
lewis youre not listening to me
the locusts prehistoric dna has made them
stronger than they should be
theyre multiplying like crazy
and theyre not dying
what part of this dont you understand
i do understand
this is gonna be a global famine
hey hey
we cant anticipate everything
we need to eradicate the ones we released
what
all of them
no no
like
henry we dont want to cause a panic
like yesterday
we want control
theres no such thing
when were afraid
what do we do
what have we done before
we follow through
thats what we do
right
right
we found the girl
shes en route
cost me a fortune
what
wait you found her
yeah found them both
her and the little raptor
blue reproduced all on her own
just like you said
youre so smart henry
thats why this works
you understand the value
of these creatures
you always have
i do too
we dont stop because of a what
little side project went south
hey if they trace the locusts back to us
they come for the dinosaurs
all your work gone
billions of dollars in assets gone
diamonds with no one to mine them
you really think
shes the solution
okay
everything involving the girl
goes through me right
is she all right
she better be
shes the most valuable
intellectual property on the planet
i said id call you
they land yet
second plane is incoming
who said anything about a second plane
we flew them separately
im not taking any chances
and well need payment before delivery
i didnt like what happened last time
okay okay just call me when its done
you said i was going someplace safe
you are
walk to the car
no
its not a choice
fifty grand to fly one little raptor
not bad
whats with the girl
not your problem
pleasure doing business
were ready lets go
owen
hi claire
i thought you wouldve chosen
a quieter line of work
i tried my cousin and i opened a café
i lasted three weeks
the way the world is headed
its hard to look away
delacourt was hired by soyona santos
a broker
in the underground dinosaur trade
we dont have intel on his cargo
but once they make the exchange
well see what they know about your girl
you can listen in
but promise me you will not make contact
no
there is a big underground market
for dinosaurs now
europe middle east northern africa
it all comes through here
dont look at anyone
dont talk to anyone
just try to blend in
im okay
still flying for santos huh
you must need money
whats it to you
ive got cargo
a thousand kilos of dinosaur
to palermo
lystrosaurus very rare
i give you two thousands
eight
he may be ugly but hes got spirit
what are you gonna do with him
hes mine now what do you care
yeah come on man
yes

i fly for whoever got a bag
but well call this one a favor

ill take you all to biosyn
but i cant promise it wont be dangerous
youre willing to risk your life
for people you never met
you wanna ask questions
or you want a ride
well take the ride
so this is
our habitat development lab
a lot of exciting discoveries
as of late
weve brought back numerous species
in their purest form
and i mean complete untouched genomes
like moros intrepidus
what
yeah
wow
what about splicing dna
you know creating new species
oh no dr sattler
we dont do that here
we like to think were more evolved
looks like we still have
some time left before your ride
uh would you guys like to tour
the facilities yourselves
oh uh i mean we could
yeah why not
great
ill meet you guys at the hyperloop
station three in about 30 minutes
elevators are down this hall
not those
those lead you
down to the sublevels
you need special clearance
to get down there
oh okay
thirty minutes
here take this
okay
yep
im really sorry
that it had to happen this way
yep thats what kidnappers say
claire should never have
hidden you away
youre way too important maisie
you took her too
yeah
we needed her
to help us understand you
hey beta
you okay
did you say beta is that her name
i gave it to her
beta is pretty special
you know when we made blue
we used monitor lizard dna
to fill in the gaps in her genome
monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate
so beta and blue
are genetically identical
and thats what they have
in common with you and
charlotte
what do you know about charlotte
she died
a long time ago
it broke my grandpas heart
so he made me
no maisie actually he didnt
charlotte made you
im so excited for everyone to see
what weve been doing here
theres new technology being made
new science like every day almost
and its great to be in the center of
center of that
charlotte lived on site b
with all of us till the storm
she loved dinosaurs
charlotte be careful
yeah i will
she grew up around scientists
and eventually
she became one herself
a butterfly flew
info my office this morning
they say tiny things have huge impacts
and i agree wholeheartedly
she was brilliant
for all my work with creatures
wings flapping
in ways that ill never be
in the metaphysics of identity
can a replica truly be the original
and if its possible what makes it so
ive lost my pen
is that me
yeah
just like blue charlotte was able
to have a child all by herself
she created you with her own dna
so i do have a mother
your grandfather didnt want
anyone to know the truth
he was protecting her and you
and were the same
you were
when you were a baby charlotte started
to show symptoms of a genetic disorder
thats how she died
she didnt know she had it
until after you were born
do i have it too
no
she changed your dna
she altered every cell in your body
to eradicate this disease
no one on earth has ever known
how to do that
she fixed me
charlottes discovery
is a part of you now
your dna could change the world
and i have to know how she did it
but i just cant replicate her work
if i could just study you and beta
whose dna was never changed i could
fix a terrible mistake that ive made
what kind of mistake
sublevel six restricted
thanks for coming
which lab did malcolm say
l4
this is it
okay get in
get the sample and get out
and move slow
they can swarm
at the slightest disturbance
orthoptera
two weeks
fully mature this one
ready easy
okay go
what
go get it
is that necessary
whwhat did you think was gonna happen
i have to take a sample
we need concrete evidence this is it
alan you said there was no time
can you get it
of course i can get it
okay easy
watch its legs
ugh yech
here we go
theyre cell signaling between them
this is not good ellie
i almost got it
how does she remain an asset henry
if youre incriminating both of us
by showing her classified things
on the computer
charlotte lockwood believed
the methods used at jurassic park
could cure disease
she was right
having filled the gaps
in maisies genome with altered dna
she used a pathogen to deliver
the repaired sequence to every cell
if i can repurpose what she did
i could change the locust dna
eradicating them in a single generation
maisie and the baby raptor
will provide the missing data
hey do you wanna get out of here
what the
got it
oh my god
theyre everywhere help me
oh god no
oh my god oh my god
maisie
asset containment breach
please remain at your stations
asset containment breach
please remain at your stations
oh my god
oh god i cant see
wheres the key
oh god
you okay
yeah you
yeah
oh
youre dr ellie sattler and alan grant
you were at jurassic park
what are you doing here
what what
what are you doing here
im maisie lockwood
uh hey we dont uh
were not
we dont work for biosyn
i can tell
we gotta get out of here
yeah we should go
okay in and out
we find your girl and go
tower this is n141 request to land
for freight delivery over
n141 negative
weve been advised youre carrying
unauthorized passengers over
copy that tower
be advised shipment is perishable
we need immediate clearance
its an emergency over
there isnt no
negative
return to point of origin
you seem to be breaking up
are you hearing me on your side
may need to check systems
nice try kayla
they will down your bird
who is this
is this denise
you do not want me to start spilling
secrets denise you remember dubrovnik
shes
different denise in accounts
talked to santos
its the girls parents
lets shut off the ads
are you sure
uhhuh
whats that
uh
thats the uh
thats the aerial deterrent system
keeps the airborne life away
why is it blinking
dead ass denise in the tower
just turned it off
we gotta get out of this airspace
right now
thats another plane right
not exactly
is that a
quetzalcoatlus
late cretaceous
should have stayed there
okay okay
its cool were good its gone
this plane is going down
if youre gonna eject
you need to do it now
i only got one chair and shes in it
you dont have parachutes
i wasnt expecting company
claire we gotta get you off this plane
what
the parachute is gonna open automatically
if it doesnt you pull this lever
do you understand me
claire
if it doesnt open automatically
youre gonna pull
this lever behind you okay
ten thousand feet
hey youre the one
whos gotta go to get to her
youre her mom
youre her only shot
ill see you again
i love you
whats the plan
whatever happens thats the plan
three
this way
alan we need the code
lets try this thing
yeah
get down
thank god its you
i know
this place is a maze
good youre here
we were so confused
i thought we were lost
then you said station three
and i was like here
do you have the sample
what
what are you talking about
the dna sample do you have it
biosyns responsible
for the locust epidemic
dodgsons covering it up
you were right
im here to help you
do you have it
yeah
good
this pod will take you
to the airfield
we have a plane ready to fly
ian told you about hexapod allies
no
i told him
what
okay you guys gotta go
wait
maisie
maisie lockwood
go
okay
that was my baby
okay okay
whered you learn to fly
uh air force
legacy on my mamas side
yeah im navy
okay so howd you end up doing this
i was a legit contract pilot
for a grip
but it didnt exactly pay enough
to be out here sending money home
so i hit up a few contacts
for the more lucrative shady shit
honestly i might be done
with this line of work
is that why youre helping us
i was there
when they handed your girl off to biosyn
i could have said something but i didnt
and when i saw her picture
it isnt enough to do nothing
thank you
no
nope
what an asshole
you good
yeah yeah yeah
yeah im not shook at all you
nah nah no
ejection seat beacon
well find her
okay okay
you really love her huh
yeah
i get it
i like redheads too
what god
who is that
its grant and sattler
is this live
twelve minutes ago
we were tracking the escaped asset
my guys missed it
they stole a dna sample
howd they get in there
they used an access key
yankee white clearance
one of our cameras saw ian malcolm
put something in sattlers pocket
all right
i want to see him
and get ramsay up here too
will you
where are they now
on the way to the airfield
they caught the hyperloop
right on schedule
how are you
you all right
not really no
hey
i uh knew your mom
you did
mmhmm
yeah a few years
after hammond died
she came to my university to lecture
and we became good friends
what was she like
brilliant
lightyears ahead
of everybody else
and she had a conscience
while they were out
building theme parks
well she was determined to prove
that genetic power could save lives
and i was her experiment
no
she wanted a child more than anything
but she wanted you to have
what she couldnt
a full life
i didnt know her long
but i know she loved you very much
whats happening
this must be the old amber mines
were inside the mountain
they mustve made access doors
when they built these tunnels
you ready
im good
no thats not reasonable
you want to go into the dark tunnel
i want to stay in the bulletproof tube
whos being unreasonable
but the bulletproof tube has no door
look uh
i know how you feel
its its scary it is
but trust me moving forward
is better than staying still
and dr sattler here is
a good person in a tight spot
and this is a tight spot
so you coming
all right
hey i heard the alarm
everything all right
yeah no no
nothing we cant uh handle listen
you rang
oh good
dr malcolm you are
fired
what
it was such a cushy gig
you can give your access key to security
if you still have it
one of the hyperloop pods
just shut down in the amber mines
what
wow this day
uh which which pod are we
are there um
dinosaurs in the mines
there are dinosaurs everywhere
technically birds are dinosaurs
ggenetically speaking at least
okay
lewis grant and sattler are in this pod
we need to send a security team asap
absolutely ramsay thank you
lets all just stay in our lanes though
we can take care of it
thank you doctor
thats it huh
nothing else to see here
uh im not sure
i admire your tone right now
you need to leave
yeah i do
but first
i owe all these folks an apology
i think that by lending my cachet
to this joint
i mightve made it seem
as if biosyn wasnt rotten to the core
thats enough ian
see heres how they get you
they give you so many promotions
in a short period of time
that it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking
oh my god
then there are doors that you dont open
things that you ignore
but mainly hes exploiting
your enchantment with these
is there an actual concern here
or are you just
youre racing toward the extinction
of our species and you dont care
you know exactly what youre doing
but you wont stop
you cant
i thought you might be different
but youre just like everyone else
you see what you want to see
you imagine unchecked avarice
so thats what you find
you envision what
an evil unbound prometheus
so thats what i am to you
prometheus got gored
so will you you rapacious rat bastard
ramsay will you help dr malcolm
gather his things
his room and then to the airfield
thats it
dodgson
allosaurus
giganotosaurus
largest known terrestrial carnivore
he put two apex predators in one valley
pretty soon theres only gonna be one
did you feel that
thats an air current
must be an opening up ahead
how old is this mine
do you think
just breathe
nobody panic
just watch out for bats
who said anything about bats
i hate bats
well theres probably no bats
no falling rocks
just a possibility of toxic gas
dehydration hypothermia
just possibilities nothing for certain
i shouldve left you where you were
why did i bring you into this
you were happy in your element
what what ellie
what
i wasnt happy
you werent
do you guys have kids
what
uh no ii do two
but not with him
uh no
no just old friends
uh just old friends
really
wont be long
before security knows youre gone
a map that looks like an old map
you dont have a new map
theres an access gate
at the northeast corner of the mine
if your friends make it out
if
when they make it out
yes sir
thats where theyll be
these roads are protected right
uh yeah id drive fast
you did good
yeah well actually
its a complete disaster but thanks
not yet
lewis
what what are you doing down here
actually no this is good
you sent a rescue team
into the mines for grant and sattler
yeah what okay of course yeah
are you deleting research files
uh we are yes
you and i got to protect
what weve built right
you think they wouldnt love
to get their hands in here
take all the resources
ive spent decades collecting
just because what
we made a bad call it happens
seven
hexapod allies
what oh
okay what do people know
the locusts were designed to spread
genetic modifications to crops
protection against droughts
frost disease a breakthrough
goddamn right it was
yeah only it didnt work
you ensured they cant eat biosyn seed
so theyre eating everything else
which i did not see coming
we have a solution
independent farmers suffered at first
henrys on it
nobody cared much now the worlds
food supply is verging on collapse
find the girl change the locusts dna
the trails gonna lead back to you
we solve the problem
ramsay thank you
disappears in the next news cycle
just like everything else this is not it
81c1
or you could accept responsibility
share your research with the world
yep
you know i was 28 once i get it
you look around you
realize youre surrounded by injustice
and cruelty and you wanna change it
yep
and then you grow up
somebody puts you in charge
and you see that there is no changing it
its chomp or be chomped
where are you going with that
oh
we dont apologize for our mistakes
we erase them
stay on your phone i may need you
watch yourself
ellie
yeah
what was that
be careful
oh my god are you okay
forget the hat
come on
go go go
go go go go go
theres no button
its a car
oh my god ian
ian over here
help
please
open the gate
please help us
do you know the code
i didnt know there was gonna be a code
i didnt know there was gonna be a code
oh my god
oh my god
the brake
pull the brake
there are 10000 possibilities
push your legs against it
1984
come on ian
kick up against it
hurry
miles daviss birthday 0526
ian
please please
do something
were not gonna make it
lets lets all try to stay positive
please
i know i know i know
oh my god
what do you know
it actually worked
ian this is maisie
hi maisie

we need to get out of this valley
yeah
come on come on
lets go lets go
come on come on
go on get
yuck
hey
oh my god
i thought you were dead
what do they even eat
we better get inside
go ahead
containment chamber compromised
its locked
gonna need something heavy
something sharp or both
that cant be right
is that
oh no
oh my god
hes burning the evidence
oh my god oh my god oh my
thats bananas
oh my god
i i know that
this may seem precarious but
no were teetering
shouldnt we all lean
to the left or something
thats a very constructive
thank you maisie

they helped me escape
yeah
you okay
thank you
yeah
we gotta go
gonna have to break a window
to get inside that thing
hope nobody is afraid of heights
dont move
dont move
what is that
giganotosaurus
biggest carnivore the world has ever seen
maisie maisie
look at me look at me
go
go go go
come on
no no no no
hustle
im gonna die
climb climb kid
no
youre not no youre not

go go go
come on
hey
oh yeah come here
help me open it
i got ya
go go go
go go go
run
see not so bad
come on
owen
claire
call an evacuation
we need to bring the animals inside
the regulations are clear
that in the event of a level two
shh
jeffrey
god
damn it
just
just call it
attention attention
this is an immediate evacuation order
remote herding system
is now active
all living assets en route
to emergency containment
i cant get hold of anybody
since everything is on fire
dr sattler get some water
oh thanks
dr grant
here you are
im owen grady
big fan i read your book
well book on tape
owen grady owen grady
yeah i know who you are
you trained raptors
i tried yeah
how you doing
the one here
you were at jurassic world
jurassic world not a fan
mmmmm
okay
so we good to find a way out of here
yep
lets get it
theres a helicopter
out in the main complex
we turn the ads back on we go home
wait whats an ads
aerial deterrent system
you know
for the pterodactyls and shit
keeps them away from the helicopters
well how do we turn it back on
it looks like all the systems
run through to the control room
which is on the third floor
these outposts
are all connected underground
all right easy rambo
so you worked
in the raptor pen huh
yeah
wow and what happens
do you just tell them what to do
and they comply or
well its a humananimal bond
based on mutual respect
mmhmm
i had a dog once
humped my leg so much
i got a callus on my shinbone
thats a true story
oh god hey good
heres what im thinking
we get started again
you and me
i can get money
yeah moneys cheap these days
whwhats the matter
dont look so worried theres
theres opportunity in everything
eeven this youll learn that
ive been thinking
maybe you take more of a lead now okay
youre ready i think
here take
what the hell
is the matter with you
it was you
you told malcolm
about the program yyou
you set this whole thing up
you set me up
i gave you every opportunity
i did not have i
we have an understanding ramsay
and you do not break that
i would not break this
im not you
uhoh
this is very bad
this is the same system
we used at the park
great so we can turn on the thing
and then we all get out of here
lets see ads
whats this whats error 99
not enough power
in a breakdown
all available power is seized
by the primary system to keep running
we need all that power
to reactivate the ads
the systems safety feature
is whats gonna kill us
of course
how do we get more power
we cant
but we can redistribute what we have
just need to
shut down the primary system
yes exactly
where is it
uh next floor up
im coming with you
we escaped down here
where is that water treatment center
hydroelectric system sub eight
give me eight minutes
i could find her
wait whos this now
beta blues baby
velociraptor
what
a baby raptor
you gave her a name
how about that
i made a promise
we would bring her home
you made a promise
to a dinosaur
youre coming with us right
maisie i
please
ill be on channel five
okay
were on three
come back
i always come back
ill have that chopper hot in ten
wait for my signal
evacuation phase four complete
all living assets now in containment
come on
still get nightmares
all the time
you
i have a lot of regrets
oh yeah
well
we hold on to regret
we stay in the past
what matters i guess is
is what we do now
right
yeah
ah
okay
nobody said thered be bugs
b4 shes in here
watch the sides
they always come from the sides
you know at first we thought
they disembowel their prey but no
theyre smart enough
to go straight for the throat
the veins the arteries
sometimes both at the same time
okay
okay
weve got you
its right down that aisle
its right down that aisle where you are
why are they skulking in
you can sprint right for it
okay here it is
okay itll be a yellow button
on a grid of six
theres a green button
do you see a green button
its not that green button
its four from the bottom
above this
whoa whoa whoa
fourth one up
third one down or fourth one up
same thing
ian be specific
she was here
lights off
i dont know how i could possibly
be more specific
other than to say
that the one you want is marked
with e1 e1
e1
e1
yeah
no no no no no
damn it shes fast
hey
eyes on me
ive got to hit her
on the side of her neck
maisie
youre gonna hold her focus
grant
were triangulating
go
sorry girl
i promised your mom
id get you home
primary system rebooting
wait oh no no no
no no no
its rebooting
it shouldnt be doing that
here take this
gonna stay on it
shut it down
were gonna make it work
were gonna figure this out its complex
we dont have time for complex
primary system compromised
wait a minute wait a minute
aerial deterrent system active
victory victory
damn that felt good
oh come on
whats your story
wait
at biosyn were dedicated to the idea
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves
all right kayla were good to go
okay cutie
come here
you all right
someday
okay
hey
i remember you
please you have to listen to me
you created an ecological disaster
and i can fix it
charlotte lockwood changed every cell
in maisies body
it saved her life
if i can understand
how charlotte rewrote maisies dna
i can spread change from one locust
to the entire swarm
before its too late
its okay
its okay
its what she wouldve wanted
thank you
no no no
no no no no no
him
not him not him
its always him
every si
is that a dinosaur
on your shoulder
yeah why
i have air meet me at the center
no no no wait wait wait
hey hey do not land in here
i dont have a choice dude
the valley isnt safe
no theyre not in the valley anymore
oh
this isnt about us
go go
come on
oh my god get him up
come on come on
come on
come on come on come on
come on
ellie no
come on maisie go
ramsay get in
come on come on come on
everybody hold on to somebody
ow
no at every level
complete systemic corruption
in the executive ranks
systemic corruption you get that
write that down
yeah its crazy
and then and then we crashed
into this ice lake right
i mean
they literally owe me a plane
i need to get this sample vetted
at the lab
before i take it to my contact
at the times
you could uh come with me
unless you need
to get back to your dig
ellie
yeah
i am coming with you
i know one more minute
then well send you home with your folks
today marks the first day of testimony
from biosyn whistleblower ramsay cole
the senate will also hear from
doctors grant sattler and malcolm
who have been vocal in this debate
since the incident at jurassic park
you look
uncomfortable
trustworthy
yeah not getting used to it
lets finish this
yeah
dr henry wu
has found an emergency solution
to the ecological crisis
his use of a pathogen
to alter the locusts dna
has revolutionized modern genetics
he attributed the discovery
to another scientist charlotte lockwood
who died nearly 13 years ago
by un decree biosyn valley
has been designated a global sanctuary
the animals will live there free
safe from the outside world
money
money
thank you
life on earth has existed
for hundreds of millions of years
and dinosaurs were only a part of that
and were an even smaller part of that
they really put us in perspective
the idea that life on earth
existed 65 million years ago
its humbling
we act like were alone here
but were not
were part of a fragile system
