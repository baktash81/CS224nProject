and this  too  was given me to know 
that the beast would come to our world 
the world of krull   
    and his black fortress would be seen
in the land   
    that the smoke of burning villages
would darken the sky   
    and the cries of the dying echo
through deserted valleys 
but one thing i cannot know 
whether the prophecy be true   
    that a girl of ancient name
shall become queen   
    that she shall choose a king  and that
together they shall rule our world   
    and that their son shall rule the galaxy 
father 
colwyn should have been here by now 
he may be forced to travel
through the forests and the stone country 
all the passes and the roads
are held by the slayers 
colwyn may not get through 
that would please you 
i sent men to help 
but i see no reason for an alliance
with our ancient enemies 
father  the invaders
are destroying our world 
we must have the alliance 
only if we re united 
do we stand a chance against them 
then  i ll make a treaty with king turold 
it s not necessary for you to marry his son 
it s the only way to guarantee the alliance 
the marriage is my choice 
if it were anyone but turold s son 
colwyn is a great fighter 
good fighters make bad husbands 
perhaps 
horsemen approaching 
open the gate 
we sent to you for help  none came 
twenty men were despatched to you 
we ve lost 300 getting here 
i didn t choose this marriage  turold 
nor did i  eirig 
i chose it  your daughter chose it 
it ll be done 
and you ll lead this army with mine
against the slayers 
whatever army i have 
i ll lead against them   
   until i ve won or i m dead 
i have chosen well 
so have i 
your journey was hard 
but necessary 
  it may already be too late 
  it s not too late 
is this where the ceremony will be 
tonight at moonrise 
my father says that good fighters
make bad husbands 
  that depends 
  on what 
on whether you expect a husband
to follow you around   
   jump every time you clap your hands 
wouldn t you jump for me 
no  of course not  you re a warrior 
from this day  my kingdom is no more 
nor mine 
a single kingdom under our children 
agreed 
i give fire to water 
it will not return  except from the hand
of the woman i choose as my wife 
i take fire from water 
i give it only to the man
whom i choose as my husband 
take the fire from my hand 
call the roll  guards 
  slayers 
  arm yourselves 
  we ll fight together 
  no  is there a safe way out 
  an underground passage 
  come on 
my place is with you 
  do you love me 
  of course i love you 
then go 
colwyn  hurry back to me 
everyone in the centre of the room 
get back 
take it 
here 
colwyn 
lyssa 
colwyn 
colwyn 
father 
lyssa 
she s alive 
where 
stay still 
where 
for now  beyond your reach 
who are you 
i am ynyr 
the old one 
well  not as old as all that 
you ve come down
from the granite mountains 
yes  i am needed now 
father 
there s no time now for grief 
you haven t lost a father
and a bride on the same day 
nor have i become king on that day 
i have no kingdom 
your kingdom may be greater
than you know 
i give it to you  old man 
and welcome to it 
i came to find a king   
   and i find a boy instead 
lyssa 
they will hold her in the black fortress 
can you lead me to it 
you must have help 
i ll find men on the way 
in the fortress 
you will face more than the slayers 
you will face the beast 
who is their leader 
he can be killed 
perhaps 
but no man has ever seen him and lived 
you will need more than men and swords 
you will need the power of the glaive 
the glaive is nothing
but an ancient symbol 
it doesn t really exist 
it exists  up there 
in a cave on the highest peak 
without the glaive 
you will never be able to reach lyssa 
i need weapons  not symbols 
once  the glaive was
a very powerful weapon 
it can be so again 
but only in the hands of the right man 
for only the right man
can retrieve the glaive 
am i that man 
i wish i knew 
i cannot go with you 
don t worry  if it s there 
i ll come back with it 
if you do not come back with it   
   you ll not come back at all 
you have been brought here for a marriage 
i am the king you will choose 
do not use it until you need it 
  how will i know when 
  you ll know 
if you lead me to the black fortress 
i ll use it soon enough 
that will not be so easy 
at each sunrise  the black fortress moves 
sometimes it is in the mountains 
sometimes in the desert   
   sometimes in the sea 
never the same place twice 
but you told me you knew where to find it 
there are kingly virtues other than bravery 
courtesy is one of them 
i m sorry 
it s the thought of lyssa there 
i  too  was young   
   once 
i  too  loved as you do 
but your love will be   
   luckier than mine 
what i told you is that i knew
how to find the fortress   
   and that is by seeking the vision
of the blind emerald seer 
but his place isn t known either 
it is known to me 
it is a day s journey from here  come 
help 
help  i m drowning 
this might have been quicksand 
i might have been sucked to my death
while you stood there gawking 
where is this place 
the forest near the granite mountains 
blast  1 000 miles off course 
i was rushed 
there was a difference of opinion
concerning a gooseberry pie 
the man left it sitting on his windowsill 
  what did he expect 
  perhaps he expected to eat it 
for that rudeness  lout 
i think i ll turn you into a bat 
might teach you some manners
to hang upside down for an hour or two 
the hill people lack the power to do harm 
we shall see about that  old man 
we ll see about that 
no  that s a recipe for hot fudge sauce 
it ll have to be a goose 
fat and ugly 
very fat  very ugly 
from that  you see what i could ve done
to you if i were a vengeful man 
you may leave me now 
dear  dear  let me see now   
the forest is not safe 
you d best travel with us 
me  travel with you 
do you know who i am 
no 
i am ergo the magnificent 
short in stature  tall in power   
   narrow of purpose and wide of vision 
and i do not travel with peasants
and beggars  goodbye 
wait  wait for me 
i ve just remembered
i have urgent business in this direction 
what business 
staying alive 
i will allow you to go
wherever you please within these walls 
for this is the palace from which you
will rule this world and countless others 
you cannot escape me 
you will be my queen 
you re no great chooser of roads  old man 
this way will save us half a day s travel 
robbers 
they re men  we don t know yet
whether they re robbers 
faces that ugly
could only belong to robbers 
don t worry  i ll turn them all into pigs 
you re surrounded by 100 men 
100 is not enough 
what have we here  a fighter 
besides  you re short about 90 men 
let s just kill them and be done with it 
soft  rhun  i don t kill men
without good reason 
nor do i  and be thankful for it 
you re escaped prisoners 
every one  slaves  bandits 
fighters and brawlers 
desperate men 
  as desperate as you ll ever see 
  good 
those are the kind of men i need 
you need 
well  see  these men
follow no man but me   
   and i follow no man at all 
  would you follow a king 
  a king 
there are many lunatics wandering
through the country claiming to be kings 
would you follow a king
to the black fortress 
now i know you re a lunatic 
i wouldn t follow my own father
to the black fortress 
  lf he could find it 
  he wouldn t be so foolish 
is it foolish to defend your world 
to fight for your homes and families 
if the invaders conquer 
you ll be slaves with the rest of us 
noble sentiments  but we fight for profit 
  you know what i mean 
  the profit s freedom  and fame 
freedom  but we have it 
and fame  it s an empty purse 
count it  go broke   
   eat it  go hungry   
   seek it and go mad 
that is true 
but this fame and this freedom
you could leave to your sons 
how did you know i had sons 
if the slayers conquer krull 
your sons will be enslaved forever 
i have no sons  but i will go with you 
the boy shames you all 
only the king and the lord marshal
have the keys to these manacles 
  you don t look like a lord marshal 
  no 
you look about the right age
to be turold s son 
the exact age 
torquil  you re growing old 
your brain s softening 
nine men like you are worth an army 
if we succeed  unlock them 
otherwise  i ll die with them 
well  you heard him  we re now an army 
an unpaid army 
you got a problem  rhun 
can t a man even talk to himself
without being interrupted 
let s go 
  come along 
  nennog  move 
gooseberries 
ergo 
ynyr  help 
horrible  there was
a terrible creature over there 
and over there 
a creature with only one eye 
  one eye 
  a cyclops 
he was aiming a spear straight at me 
had it been so  you would now be dead 
he was aiming at a slayer   
   for they have ancient hatred
between them 
long ago  his ancestors lived
in a world far from krull 
and had   
   two eyes like other men 
then they made a bargain with the beast
who is the leader of the slayers 
they gave up one of their eyes
in exchange for the power   
   to see into the future 
but they were cheated 
for the only future
they are permitted to see   
   is the time of their own death 
they re sad  solitary creatures 
born to know   
   the day they will die 
today would have been my day 
if it hadn t been for him 
up you go 
we three will go on 
the rest will remain here 
we four will go on  i m not staying behind
with these criminals 
we four will go 
he marches us
towards a solid face of rock 
the man has raisins in his braincase 
i recognise an old friend 
mad  they re all mad 
we seek the black fortress 
such a vision will be opposed 
who seeks it 
the new king 
with an old voice 
you know the voice 
yes  my friend 
we re trying to find the   
i will seek the fortress for you 
  got any sugarballs 
  no 
  gumdrops 
  no 
what kind of boy are you 
boys always have candy 
i have a cinnamon bar 
share and share alike 
i am ergo the magnificent 
short in stature  tall in power 
narrow of purpose and wide of vision 
that is very impressive 
i should hope so 
i m titch 
that s not impressive  but adequate 
the black fortress 
where is it 
are you all right 
yes 
the beast does not like
curious seers poking into his affairs 
his power is too great
for you to overcome 
yes  here  but there is one place
where his power cannot reach 
the emerald temple 
yes  in that place 
he cannot oppose my vision 
will you travel there with us 
it is in the great swamp 
a treacherous place 
our need is great 
the temple is at the centre of the swamp 
where three trees grow as one 
how can anything grow in that place 
it smells of death 
death and power are close cousins 
don t think i like your relatives  old man 
have a look 
the profit of this journey 
they re worth a fortune 
maybe  to someone
who s very nearsighted 
what 
but they were emeralds 
hey  rhun  emeralds 
i swear it  they were emeralds 
rocks in our pockets and gravestones
above our heads is all we ll get from this 
slayers 
  from the lake 
  take cover 
  over here 
  get down 
get down there 
quick  over there 
colwyn 
over here 
that s the second time
you ve saved my life 
  i am ergo 
  the magnificent 
hasn t he got a name 
his name is rell 
he visits the seer sometimes 
he doesn t speak much 
so i ve noticed  except to be sarcastic
to people who wish to be friends 
or jest with those
who already are his friends 
my name is no jest  beanpole  it s nice
to have a short name if you re 20 feet tall   
   but small people need large names
to give them weight 
your actions give you weight  my friend 
i saw you save the boy from a spear 
that s what friends are supposed
to do for each other 
quite so 
you ve been with us for a long way now 
since the beginning  when i learned
that the old one had come down   
   i knew that the time had come 
join us  then  all men need company 
yes 
all men 
that way 
if i had my wish 
i d be out of this gloomy place right away 
if i really had my wish 
i d be sitting on top of a gooseberry pie   
   as big as a mountain 
no  that s a bit greedy 
i ll settle for one as big as a house 
i d wish for a puppy 
only one puppy  if you re wishing 
why not wish for 100 
i only want one 
that s a foolish wish 
and you  rell  what would you wish for 
ignorance 
no 
  nennog 
  help 
help him 
the ground  it s sinking 
it is the power of the beast 
  link up  make a chain 
  help  get me out 
rhun  get hold of him 
hurry

  i will stay 
  be careful 
thank you 
i ll lead the seer  titch  you go ahead 
thank you  brother 
i ll lead the seer  you go ahead with titch 
  this way 
  no 
you sure 
i recognise this tree 
i recognise the place now 
we re in sight of the trees  brother 
he who seeks the knowledge
must lead me 
no one else may approach 
here is the knowledge you seek 
the beast has many weapons 
this was one of them 
the changeling 
how did you know 
i found the seer s body in the quicksand 
he gave his life for us 
he was my only family 
we re your family now 
now we have no way
to find the black fortress 
there is one who might help 
who 
the widow of the web 
that creature helps no one 
and none who go there return 
  she has great powers 
  yeah  to kill 
she may not kill me  for i know her name 
her name is death 
she had another name once 
an ancient and powerful name 
we all risk our lives on this journey 
my risk is no greater than yours 
i must try 
where are my papers 
blast  i really must get organised
one of these days 
puppy 
where s ergo 
he ll be back soon 
from here  i go on alone 
  i m going with you 
  no 
if two approach 
she would certainly kill both 
alone  i may have a chance 
each to his fate  colwyn 
yeah 
yes  each to his fate 
if i m not back by morning   
   you ll know mine 
we stay here 
i still say it was a foolish wish 
we have no food 
and the men are too tired to hunt 
  hey  kegan 
  hello 
doesn t one of your wives
live in a village near here 
lona  no  she moved down to the river 
how many wives does he have 
about seven or eight  at the last count 
he s a travelling man  you see 
he covers a lot of ground 
merith 
she lives in a village
at the edge of the giant trees 
can she cook 
it s not her strongest point 
but hear  i tell you 
just have her bring provisions 
magnificence there reckons he can cook 
we ll soon see 
plenty more if you re still hungry 
out of my way  let me get at it 
  well 
  well  what 
who s the girl then 
her village was burned 
she d nowhere to go  so i took her in 
look at her one more time 
and i ll throw her out 
merith  oh  my sweet 
she doesn t hold a candle to you 
  she s not even pretty 
  yeah 
now  look  petal 
  faithful   is my middle name 
you must eat something 
i m not hungry 
please  for me 
thank you 
what troubles you 
you have chosen a paltry kingdom
on an insignificant planet 
and love 
love is fleeting 
power is eternal 
such is my power 
it can be yours 
i don t want your power 
do not let my form frighten you 
lyssa 
i can assume any form i wish 
any form you wish 
there s no love in that form 
and you think there s love
in your boy king 
i ve not held a man in my arms
since my lover left 
this is a lie 
i know how painful it is
to be far from your lover 
he will betray you 
comfort me for one night 
he will not 
i can t betray my bride 
then he will die 
let me comfort you 
i can t accept comfort when she has none 
you will not then 
i cannot 
my master said 
 make him betray her  if not  kill him  
yes  he is my master  these talons
were a heartbeat away from your throat 
i could have killed you in an instant 
but  in the hour i knew you  i loved you 
it is you who are betrayed 
power is fleeting  love is eternal 
remember me 
consider this power 
if you consent to be my queen   
    i will halt the attacks of the slayers 
it is in your power
to stop the killing and burning 
each hour you delay 
more innocent people will be killed 
think on it 
hurry  colwyn 
i seek the widow 
enter here and die 
lyssa 
lyssa 
who speaks that name 
it is i  ynyr 
i give you this time 
lyssa 
i was young when i last heard that name 
i was young when i last spoke it to you 
and my face was as beautiful as my name 
and i loved you  lyssa  with all my heart 
but you would not stay with me 
  there were responsibilities  duty   
  ambition 
you had a son 
we had a son 
but you said nothing 
where is he 
i killed him when he was born 
and this is my punishment 
my son 
since i could not kill you 
my rage needed a victim 
i know you can never forgive me 
i cannot forgive myself 
i have already forgiven you 
you can never forgive a woman
who has killed your son 
if i had not   
   could i see you now as i saw you then 
and allow me to see through your eyes 
how could i have left you 
your vision is your gift to me 
and your vision could be your gift to me 
  what can i see for you 
  the black fortress  where does it rise 
tomorrow   
   in the iron desert 
but the knowledge is useless 
for you can t leave here 
no man has ever escaped the web 
there is a young girl being held
in the fortress 
a young girl with your name 
a young man seeks her 
the age i was when   
   you and i met 
when you and i loved 
what you ask is beyond my power 
it can be turned only once 
that is the law of the web 
then the second lyssa will share your fate 
she will die  grow old and lonely 
she will die in a place of darkness 
this world will be a place of darkness 
these are the sands of my life 
accept them and the spider
will have no power to harm you 
but your own life runs out with the sand 
what about your life 
i give it to the girl who bears my name 
i cannot stop the sand 
you cannot stop time 
go now 
save the other lyssa 
at sunrise   
at sunrise   
   the black fortress will appear   
   in the iron desert 
it will remain there until sunrise
of the following day 
you must   
you must reach it 
we ll reach it  you ll be with us 
no 
no  my   
   race is run 
use your power wisely 
do not squander it 
i learned the power from you 
i won t forget 
we ll bury him here 
the iron desert s 1 000 leagues from here 
fire mares 
fire mares can travel
1 000 leagues in a day 
there s time if we move quickly 
that s it  drive them back 
the grey is the leader 
hold him 
come on  come on 
i ve got you 
gentle as a baby 
  saddle the others  quickly 
  right 
come on  hold still 
stand still  you beast 
take good care of him 
  why doesn t he come 
  it s his time to die 
if he s going to die anyway 
why doesn t he come with us 
no  he must stay here and accept his fate 
if he opposes it 
he ll bring great pain on himself 
steady  i must remain here 
is it time 
you ve done enough  rell  stay here 
each to his fate 
each to his fate 
rell  i ll ride with you 
i have to stay here  my friend 
we had no time 
hold on 
there it is 
yes  and only madmen would want
to get this close to it 
we re going to get a lot closer 
and quickly  it s almost dawn 
we must get inside
before the twin suns rise 
rhun  get back 
i was wrong 
the journey was worthwhile 
finish it   
  we ll have to rush them 
  no  wait 
we ll be picked off as soon as we move 
colwyn  look 
follow him 
come on 
kegan  mind the boy 
get your axe in the opening 
it s no use 
this is my time 
keep moving 
which way 
look out

  we ll get you out of here 
here s where i stay 
lead on 
i can t hold him 
throw us a rope 
slayers 
i m going down

get back 
  come out 
  no  wait 
there is nothing we can do  get out 
from here  i must go on alone 
go where  there s no way in 
there is one way 
we must find the others  ergo 
they ve stopped 
bardolph  let it go 
look out 
  lyssa 
  colwyn 
not here  colwyn  he s too powerful 
you must fight him away from the centre 
the glaive is gone 
i have no way to fight him 
colwyn  it s not the glaive  it s you 
no  lyssa  it s us 
it s us he can t defeat 
it won t return to me except from the hand
of the woman i choose as my wife 
i give it only to the man
whom i choose as my husband 
take the fire from my hand 
we have to find the others  come on 
i won t leave you  ergo 
  bardolph

stand back 
help them down 
he ll be all right 
  you are his queen 
  yes 
  then we ve won 
  yes 
oh  boy  i should have stuck to puppies 
i think   
   it s time we unlocked those manacles 
i thought i d keep them
as a memento of our journey 
the key s yours 
only the king and his lord marshal
carry this key 
that s right
