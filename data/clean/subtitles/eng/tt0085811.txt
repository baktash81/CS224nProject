and this too was given me to know
that the beast would come to our world
the world of krull
and his black fortress would be seen
in the land
that the smoke of burning villages
would darken the sky
and the cries of the dying echo
through deserted valleys
but one thing i cannot know
whether the prophecy be true
that a girl of ancient name
shall become queen
that she shall choose a king and that
together they shall rule our world
and that their son shall rule the galaxy
father
colwyn should have been here by now
he may be forced to travel
through the forests and the stone country
all the passes and the roads
are held by the slayers
colwyn may not get through
that would please you
i sent men to help
but i see no reason for an alliance
with our ancient enemies
father the invaders
are destroying our world
we must have the alliance
only if were united
do we stand a chance against them
then ill make a treaty with king turold
its not necessary for you to marry his son
its the only way to guarantee the alliance
the marriage is my choice
if it were anyone but turolds son
colwyn is a great fighter
good fighters make bad husbands
perhaps
horsemen approaching
open the gate
we sent to you for help none came
twenty men were despatched to you
weve lost 300 getting here
i didnt choose this marriage turold
nor did i eirig
i chose it your daughter chose it
itll be done
and youll lead this army with mine
against the slayers
whatever army i have
ill lead against them
until ive won or im dead
i have chosen well
so have i
your journey was hard
but necessary
it may already be too late
its not too late
is this where the ceremony will be
tonight at moonrise
my father says that good fighters
make bad husbands
that depends
on what
on whether you expect a husband
to follow you around
jump every time you clap your hands
wouldnt you jump for me
no of course not youre a warrior
from this day my kingdom is no more
nor mine
a single kingdom under our children
agreed
i give fire to water
it will not return except from the hand
of the woman i choose as my wife
i take fire from water
i give it only to the man
whom i choose as my husband
take the fire from my hand
call the roll guards
slayers
arm yourselves
well fight together
no is there a safe way out
an underground passage
come on
my place is with you
do you love me
of course i love you
then go
colwyn hurry back to me
everyone in the centre of the room
get back
take it
here
colwyn
lyssa
colwyn
colwyn
father
lyssa
shes alive
where
stay still
where
for now beyond your reach
who are you
i am ynyr
the old one
well not as old as all that
youve come down
from the granite mountains
yes i am needed now
father
theres no time now for grief
you havent lost a father
and a bride on the same day
nor have i become king on that day
i have no kingdom
your kingdom may be greater
than you know
i give it to you old man
and welcome to it
i came to find a king
and i find a boy instead
lyssa
they will hold her in the black fortress
can you lead me to it
you must have help
ill find men on the way
in the fortress
you will face more than the slayers
you will face the beast
who is their leader
he can be killed
perhaps
but no man has ever seen him and lived
you will need more than men and swords
you will need the power of the glaive
the glaive is nothing
but an ancient symbol
it doesnt really exist
it exists up there
in a cave on the highest peak
without the glaive
you will never be able to reach lyssa
i need weapons not symbols
once the glaive was
a very powerful weapon
it can be so again
but only in the hands of the right man
for only the right man
can retrieve the glaive
am i that man
i wish i knew
i cannot go with you
dont worry if its there
ill come back with it
if you do not come back with it
youll not come back at all
you have been brought here for a marriage
i am the king you will choose
do not use it until you need it
how will i know when
youll know
if you lead me to the black fortress
ill use it soon enough
that will not be so easy
at each sunrise the black fortress moves
sometimes it is in the mountains
sometimes in the desert
sometimes in the sea
never the same place twice
but you told me you knew where to find it
there are kingly virtues other than bravery
courtesy is one of them
im sorry
its the thought of lyssa there
i too was young
once
i too loved as you do
but your love will be
luckier than mine
what i told you is that i knew
how to find the fortress
and that is by seeking the vision
of the blind emerald seer
but his place isnt known either
it is known to me
it is a days journey from here come
help
help im drowning
this might have been quicksand
i might have been sucked to my death
while you stood there gawking
where is this place
the forest near the granite mountains
blast 1000 miles off course
i was rushed
there was a difference of opinion
concerning a gooseberry pie
the man left it sitting on his windowsill
what did he expect
perhaps he expected to eat it
for that rudeness lout
i think ill turn you into a bat
might teach you some manners
to hang upside down for an hour or two
the hill people lack the power to do harm
we shall see about that old man
well see about that
no thats a recipe for hot fudge sauce
itll have to be a goose
fat and ugly
very fat very ugly
from that you see what i couldve done
to you if i were a vengeful man
you may leave me now
dear dear let me see now
the forest is not safe
youd best travel with us
me travel with you
do you know who i am
no
i am ergo the magnificent
short in stature tall in power
narrow of purpose and wide of vision
and i do not travel with peasants
and beggars goodbye
wait wait for me
ive just remembered
i have urgent business in this direction
what business
staying alive
i will allow you to go
wherever you please within these walls
for this is the palace from which you
will rule this world and countless others
you cannot escape me
you will be my queen
youre no great chooser of roads old man
this way will save us half a days travel
robbers
theyre men we dont know yet
whether theyre robbers
faces that ugly
could only belong to robbers
dont worry ill turn them all into pigs
youre surrounded by 100 men
100 is not enough
what have we here a fighter
besides youre short about 90 men
lets just kill them and be done with it
soft rhun i dont kill men
without good reason
nor do i and be thankful for it
youre escaped prisoners
every one slaves bandits
fighters and brawlers
desperate men
as desperate as youll ever see
good
those are the kind of men i need
you need
well see these men
follow no man but me
and i follow no man at all
would you follow a king
a king
there are many lunatics wandering
through the country claiming to be kings
would you follow a king
to the black fortress
now i know youre a lunatic
i wouldnt follow my own father
to the black fortress
lf he could find it
he wouldnt be so foolish
is it foolish to defend your world
to fight for your homes and families
if the invaders conquer
youll be slaves with the rest of us
noble sentiments but we fight for profit
you know what i mean
the profits freedom and fame
freedom but we have it
and fame its an empty purse
count it go broke
eat it go hungry
seek it and go mad
that is true
but this fame and this freedom
you could leave to your sons
how did you know i had sons
if the slayers conquer krull
your sons will be enslaved forever
i have no sons but i will go with you
the boy shames you all
only the king and the lord marshal
have the keys to these manacles
you dont look like a lord marshal
no
you look about the right age
to be turolds son
the exact age
torquil youre growing old
your brains softening
nine men like you are worth an army
if we succeed unlock them
otherwise ill die with them
well you heard him were now an army
an unpaid army
you got a problem rhun
cant a man even talk to himself
without being interrupted
lets go
come along
nennog move
gooseberries
ergo
ynyr help
horrible there was
a terrible creature over there
and over there
a creature with only one eye
one eye
a cyclops
he was aiming a spear straight at me
had it been so you would now be dead
he was aiming at a slayer
for they have ancient hatred
between them
long ago his ancestors lived
in a world far from krull
and had
two eyes like other men
then they made a bargain with the beast
who is the leader of the slayers
they gave up one of their eyes
in exchange for the power
to see into the future
but they were cheated
for the only future
they are permitted to see
is the time of their own death
theyre sad solitary creatures
born to know
the day they will die
today would have been my day
if it hadnt been for him
up you go
we three will go on
the rest will remain here
we four will go on im not staying behind
with these criminals
we four will go
he marches us
towards a solid face of rock
the man has raisins in his braincase
i recognise an old friend
mad theyre all mad
we seek the black fortress
such a vision will be opposed
who seeks it
the new king
with an old voice
you know the voice
yes my friend
were trying to find the
i will seek the fortress for you
got any sugarballs
no
gumdrops
no
what kind of boy are you
boys always have candy
i have a cinnamon bar
share and share alike
i am ergo the magnificent
short in stature tall in power
narrow of purpose and wide of vision
that is very impressive
i should hope so
im titch
thats not impressive but adequate
the black fortress
where is it
are you all right
yes
the beast does not like
curious seers poking into his affairs
his power is too great
for you to overcome
yes here but there is one place
where his power cannot reach
the emerald temple
yes in that place
he cannot oppose my vision
will you travel there with us
it is in the great swamp
a treacherous place
our need is great
the temple is at the centre of the swamp
where three trees grow as one
how can anything grow in that place
it smells of death
death and power are close cousins
dont think i like your relatives old man
have a look
the profit of this journey
theyre worth a fortune
maybe to someone
whos very nearsighted
what
but they were emeralds
hey rhun emeralds
i swear it they were emeralds
rocks in our pockets and gravestones
above our heads is all well get from this
slayers
from the lake
take cover
over here
get down
get down there
quick over there
colwyn
over here
thats the second time
youve saved my life
i am ergo
the magnificent
hasnt he got a name
his name is rell
he visits the seer sometimes
he doesnt speak much
so ive noticed except to be sarcastic
to people who wish to be friends
or jest with those
who already are his friends
my name is no jest beanpole its nice
to have a short name if youre 20 feet tall
but small people need large names
to give them weight
your actions give you weight my friend
i saw you save the boy from a spear
thats what friends are supposed
to do for each other
quite so
youve been with us for a long way now
since the beginning when i learned
that the old one had come down
i knew that the time had come
join us then all men need company
yes
all men
that way
if i had my wish
id be out of this gloomy place right away
if i really had my wish
id be sitting on top of a gooseberry pie
as big as a mountain
no thats a bit greedy
ill settle for one as big as a house
id wish for a puppy
only one puppy if youre wishing
why not wish for 100
i only want one
thats a foolish wish
and you rell what would you wish for
ignorance
no
nennog
help
help him
the ground its sinking
it is the power of the beast
link up make a chain
help get me out
rhun get hold of him

this way
no

i recognise this tree
i recognise the place now
were in sight of the trees brother
he who seeks the knowledge
must lead me
no one else may approach
here is the knowledge you seek
the beast has many weapons
this was one of them
the changeling
how did you know
i found the seers body in the quicksand
he gave his life for us
he was my only family
were your family now
now we have no way
to find the black fortress
there is one who might help
who
the widow of the web
that creature helps no one
and none who go there return
she has great powers
yeah to kill
she may not kill me for i know her name
her name is death
she had another name once
an ancient and powerful name
we all risk our lives on this journey
my risk is no greater than yours
i must try
where are my papers
blast i really must get organised
one of these days
puppy
wheres ergo
hell be back soon
from here i go on alone
im going with you
no
if two approach
she would certainly kill both
alone i may have a chance
each to his fate colwyn
yeah
yes each to his fate
if im not back by morning
youll know mine
we stay here
i still say it was a foolish wish
we have no food
and the men are too tired to hunt
hey kegan
hello
doesnt one of your wives
live in a village near here
lona no she moved down to the river
how many wives does he have
about seven or eight at the last count
hes a travelling man you see
he covers a lot of ground
merith
she lives in a village
at the edge of the giant trees
can she cook
its not her strongest point
but hear i tell you
just have her bring provisions
magnificence there reckons he can cook
well soon see
plenty more if youre still hungry
out of my way let me get at it
well
well what
whos the girl then
her village was burned
shed nowhere to go so i took her in
look at her one more time
and ill throw her out
merith oh my sweet
she doesnt hold a candle to you
shes not even pretty
yeah
now look petal
faithful is my middle name
you must eat something
im not hungry
please for me
thank you
what troubles you
you have chosen a paltry kingdom
on an insignificant planet
and love
love is fleeting
power is eternal
such is my power
it can be yours
i dont want your power
do not let my form frighten you
lyssa
i can assume any form i wish
any form you wish
theres no love in that form
and you think theres love
in your boy king
ive not held a man in my arms
since my lover left
this is a lie
i know how painful it is
to be far from your lover
he will betray you
comfort me for one night
he will not
i cant betray my bride
then he will die
let me comfort you
i cant accept comfort when she has none
you will not then
i cannot
my master said
make him betray her if not kill him
yes he is my master these talons
were a heartbeat away from your throat
i could have killed you in an instant
but in the hour i knew you i loved you
it is you who are betrayed
power is fleeting love is eternal
remember me
consider this power
if you consent to be my queen
i will halt the attacks of the slayers
it is in your power
to stop the killing and burning
each hour you delay
more innocent people will be killed
think on it
hurry colwyn
i seek the widow
enter here and die
lyssa
lyssa
who speaks that name
it is i ynyr
i give you this time
lyssa
i was young when i last heard that name
i was young when i last spoke it to you
and my face was as beautiful as my name
and i loved you lyssa with all my heart
but you would not stay with me
there were responsibilities duty
ambition
you had a son
we had a son
but you said nothing
where is he
i killed him when he was born
and this is my punishment
my son
since i could not kill you
my rage needed a victim
i know you can never forgive me
i cannot forgive myself
i have already forgiven you
you can never forgive a woman
who has killed your son
if i had not
could i see you now as i saw you then
and allow me to see through your eyes
how could i have left you
your vision is your gift to me
and your vision could be your gift to me
what can i see for you
the black fortress where does it rise
tomorrow
in the iron desert
but the knowledge is useless
for you cant leave here
no man has ever escaped the web
there is a young girl being held
in the fortress
a young girl with your name
a young man seeks her
the age i was when
you and i met
when you and i loved
what you ask is beyond my power
it can be turned only once
that is the law of the web
then the second lyssa will share your fate
she will die grow old and lonely
she will die in a place of darkness
this world will be a place of darkness
these are the sands of my life
accept them and the spider
will have no power to harm you
but your own life runs out with the sand
what about your life
i give it to the girl who bears my name
i cannot stop the sand
you cannot stop time
go now
save the other lyssa
at sunrise
at sunrise
the black fortress will appear
in the iron desert
it will remain there until sunrise
of the following day
you must
you must reach it
well reach it youll be with us
no
no my
race is run
use your power wisely
do not squander it
i learned the power from you
i wont forget
well bury him here
the iron deserts 1000 leagues from here

fire mares can travel
1000 leagues in a day
theres time if we move quickly
thats it drive them back

come on come on
ive got you
gentle as a baby
saddle the others quickly

if he opposes it
hell bring great pain on himself
steady i must remain here

youve done enough rell stay here
each to his fate
each to his fate
rell ill ride with you

of the woman i choose as my wife
