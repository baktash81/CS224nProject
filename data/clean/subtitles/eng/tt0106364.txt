i m telling you  friends 
it s vigilantism at its deadliest 
how many times are we gonna
let batman cross the line 
i m sorry  councilman  but you can t blame
batman for what happened to chuckie sol 
why not  he s a loose cannon  commissioner 
it s not just my opinion  a lot of people 
including the police  i might add   
   think batman s as unstable
as the crooks he brings in 
what kind of city are we running   
   when we depend on the support
of a potential madman 
such rot  sir 
why  you re the very model of sanity 
oh  by the way  i pressed your tights
and put away your exploding gas balls 
thank you  alfred 
might one inquire what this is 
a piece of windshield from chuckie sol s car 
there s a chemical residue on it 
some kind of dense  long chain
macromolecular polymer 
adaptogenic  of course 
of course 
i should be landing any minute 
  it ll be good to see you again  arthur 
  you too 
and don t worry about a thing 
we ll clear up these old family finances 
don t forget  you ve got a bigtime
city councilman on your side 
i can t believe it s been 10 years 
thinking of looking up some old friends 
oh  arthur  don t start that again 
he s ancient history 
that s encouraging  i ll see you soon 
oh  come on  bruce

it makes him nervous 
what about the i word 
  the i word 
   ingagement  
i d watch out for brucie
if i were you  girls 
first he wines and dines you   
   makes you think you re the only
woman he s ever been interested in 
and just when you re wondering
where to register the china   
   he forgets your phone number 
that s bruce wayne s style 
  bruce 
  excuse me 
oh  god  it s awful 
bruce  bruce 
  a friend in need 
  councilman

i tell you  bruce 
i do a lot of financial planning 
when it comes to money 
you can t take the future for granted 
but money means little if you
don t have loved ones to share it with 
nothing s more important than family 
  yes  mr  beaumont 
  carl 
excuse me  sir  but there s
a mr  valestra here to see you 
he says he has an appointment 
if mr  valestra says he has an appointment 
then mr  valestra has an appointment 
that s what i like about your pop 
kiddo  he knows his priorities 
is my shirt too big 
or is that my flesh crawling 
well  mr  valestra is not
what you d call a people person 
  no kidding

hmph  so we meet again  i like the cape 
not sure about the mask  though 
have you ever seen this

  but that s your father 
he s the one who set up
their corporate partnership 
so  that s his job 
he was the one element
that tied these gangsters together 
  where s your father now 
  haven t a clue 
  why don t you try madagascar 
  that s not what you told reeves 
you told him you were
closer than ever to your father 
  you had me bugged  is that it 
  i can read lips 
then read them now  get out 
you still following your dad s orders 
the way i see it  the only one in this
room controlled by his parents is you 
sal valestra  your angel of death awaits 
guess the joke is on me 
you re not batman after all 
looks like there s a new face in gotham 
and soon his name will be all over town 
to say nothing of his legs and feet
and spleen and head 
stay away  this is not your fight 
this madness ends now 
batman  this is the police 
you are under arrest 
step away from the edge of the roof 
put your hands on top of your head
and stay in the light 
stay on him 
alpha 63 in pursuit  subject

  quick  around the back 
  come on 
come on  you grunts 
  andrea 
  hurry 
who s that 
there are certain advantages to having
a sturdy cranium  master bruce 
but then  hardheadedness
was always your virtue 
well  i m sure i have things to do elsewhere 
you have an excellent sense of timing 
it was all over tv  i had to do something 
i m grateful  of course 
but i still need to know why you re not
telling me the truth about your father 
well  i suppose the world s greatest
detective will find out eventually 
you remember daddy was having
a meeting that night with his partners 
  you re a liar and a cheat  carl 
  you ve taken what s ours 
  you re gonna pay  one way or another 
  no  please 
daddy  what s going on 
i m sorry you had to see this  miss beaumont 
  let her go 
  watch it  carl 
please  sal  give me one more day 
i swear i ll get the money 
convince me 
this time tomorrow  on my mother s grave 
as soon as the european banks open 
i ll have the whole amount wired to you 
twenty four hours 
this time tomorrow we ll have the money   
   or i ll have your heart in my hand 
let s go  boys 
  dad  are you all right 
  pack a suitcase 
  we ve got to get to the airport now 
  what 
  but you said you d have the money 
  it s not that simple 
the money s tied up in investments 
it could take weeks to free up 
but i can t leave 
bruce proposed to me 
we re going to get married 
listen to me 
i just used up the last shred of pity
sal valestra has 
if i don t pay him back within 24 hours 
they ll find us and they ll kill us both 
how    why did you do this  dad 
why did you get involved with these people 
i m sorry  andi 
i just wanted a chance for you   
i ll get you out of this 
somehow  we ll be free of those guys 
whatever it takes  that s a promise 
from that night  we were on the run 
we hid all over europe 
eventually settled on
the mediterranean coast 
dad was able to parlay the money
he embezzled into a fortune 
finally he had enough
to pay them back  or so he thought 
it would never be enough 
they wanted interest compounded in blood 
we had to find another way 
the man in the costume  your father 
he said he d get them  somehow 
when i heard about chuckie sol 
well  i had to come back to find him 
to stop him  i m sorry  bruce 
that s twice now i ve come
into your life and screwed it up 
can we make it work this time 
i want to say yes   
   but you know it s going to come down
between me and your father 
daddy doesn t matter anymore 
  i ll see you tonight 
  i ll be here 
it s so good to see you
and miss beaumont together again 
might one ask what this bodes
for your alter ego 
i m not sure  alfred 
everything s happening so fast 
  so much has changed 
  you still love each other 
it s true 
i love her 
maybe after this is settled   
   maybe then 
i m sure they would ve wanted you
to be happy  sir 
  hm 
  is something wrong 
maybe 
oh  no 
you re telling me there were four precincts
on batman and he still got away 
unbelievable 
tsk  tsk

oh  artie  i m crushed

  oh  but you knew about it afterwards 
and put it to good use  eh 
  what do you want 
  to find out who s iced the old gang 
haven t you read the papers  it s batman 
wrong  it ain t the bat 
nope  nope  i ve seen the guy 
he looks more like
the ghost of christmas future 
nowhere near as cute as batboy 
  you re saying it s someone else 
  yeah 
someone who wouldn t mind seeing
our old pals out of the way 
maybe    gulp  sob     me too 
that s when i thought about you  arturo 
an important  upstanding guy like you
could find it awkward   
   if certain secrets
were revealed about his past 
wait  you re not saying that i   
mr  reeves  miss beaumont on the line 
beaumont

oh  you devil

oh  no 
why did the joker meet with you 
it has to do with the gangster murders 
doesn t it  he thinks you re involved

beaumont needed me to help him
and his kid get out of town 
we kept in touch 
when was the last time you spoke to him 
years ago  my first election campaign 
i was running out of money
and asked beaumont for help 
he said no 
so you sold him to the mob 
i was broke  desperate 
they said all they wanted
was their money back 
  councilman  please 
  nurse

you never call and never write   
   i still got a soft spot for you 
so i m sending you a fun gift  airmail

dad

ain t it always the way 
you get in the mood and company shows up 
joker  your angel of death awaits 
i m impressed  lady 
you re harder to kill
than a cockroach on steroids 
so you figured it out 
gotta hand it to you  nice scheme 
costume s a bit theatrical 
but  hey  who am i to talk 
very cute  but i can blow smoke too  toots 
nice trick  sweetheart 
you could teach old batsy
a thing or two about disappearing 
you re not smiling  joker 
i thought you found death amusing 
me  oh  no 
you won t hear a giggle out of me 
made you look 
well  if it isn t smokey the babe 
just in time to meet her biggest fan 
how about a little pick me up 
your father s dead  isn t he 
you came into town early
to get chuckie sol   
   so you could shift the blame
to your father if you had to 
they took everything  bruce 
my dad  my life  you 
i m not saying it s right  or even sane 
but it s all i ve got left 
so either help me or get out of the way 
  you know i can t do that 
  look what they did to us 
what we could ve had  they had to pay 
but  andi  what will vengeance solve 
if anyone knows the answer
to that  bruce  it s you 
leave  andi  now 
please 
oh  batsy 
yoo hoo 
joker 
you re too late  batman 
there are 20 miles of tunnels
under this place   
   and they re all filled
with high explosives 
in five minutes  everything goes up 
you just don t know when to quit  do you 
what are you doing 
you re crazy  i m your only chance
to get out of here 
let me go or we ll both die 
whatever it takes 
for once  i m stuck without a punch line 
uh oh 
okay  i give up 
i surrendered already 
  tell her  batman 
  andrea 
you ve got to get out of here 
this place is wired to explode 
no  one way or another  it ends tonight 
goodbye  my love 
andrea 
i couldn t save her  alfred 
i don t think she wanted to be saved  sir 
vengeance blackens the soul  bruce 
i always feared you would become
that which you fought against 
you walk the edge of that abyss
every night  but you haven t fallen in   
   and i thank heaven for that 
but andrea fell into that pit years ago 
and no one  not even you 
could ve pulled her back
