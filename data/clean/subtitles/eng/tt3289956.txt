no relation to paul and carol
whos she
well for now shes a jane doe
you got something
nothing was stolen
not a scratch on the outside
of the house either
doesnt look like someone broke in
to me it looks like
they were trying to break out
cause of death
how about we skip this part tonight
come on this ones a soft ball
smoke inhalation
youre telling me
that smoke killed mr howard
well damaged nasal passage
damaged throat damaged lungs
damaged lungs yes
but incompatible with life
so youre saying thats not the cod
im saying look before you leap
where did the police find the body
in his kitchen
house on fire
front door is 30 feet away
yet hes not trying to get there
lungs are damaged
but airways not denuded nearly enough
so he stopped breathing
before that fire really got going
open him up
now now you see here
down below the occipital
a fracture
that explains the swelling in his brain
subdural hematoma
thats what did it not the smoke
everybody has a secret
some just hide them better than others
some people are better at finding them
you did good youll get there
nobodys even claimed him yet
he was all alone thats why he died
he died because he fell and hit his head
you got plans tonight
emma wants to go see a movie at the strand
i thought theyd closed that place down
no when was the last time
you even went to go see a movie dad
she has alzheimers
and hes building her a house
the notebook
oh yeah your mother made me go
and see it with her for her birthday
i fell asleep five minutes in
yeah
are you alright finishing up
yeah
whats up tilden
hematoma
stanley
hey dad
stanley got another one
dad
jesus christ
its so easy
howd you get down here
the key was in the elevator
oh my god
i gotta say this is not
what i was expecting
you said it was old but wow
i thought we were supposed to meet out front
well i got tired of waiting
where are you going
im having a little look
come back
god the place just keeps going
well three generations
of tildens keep expanding
end up with this
stateoftheart facility
hey come on
whats the rush
ive been down here all day
you got to see me at my job
why cant i see you at yours
you work at a book store
are these all people
just three tonight
can i see one
well no no you cannot see one
why not
because theres
some things you cant unsee okay
come on i can handle it
no no and my dad is way too strict
try me
so whatll it be
are you serious
are you
hell yeah
pick one
not that one the one next to it
a bodys a body
yeah well i pick that one
whats that for
to make sure hes dead
there used to be a time it was hard to tell
a comatose person from a dead one
so coroners tied bells
to everybody in the morgue
so if they heard a ting they knew somebody
down there wasnt quite ready to go
so why do you have one
well im
im a bit of a traditionalist
why did you cover his face
there wasnt much of a face left to cover
point blank gun shot blast tend to do that
who shot him
angle of entry suggests he did it to himself
until we found strychnine in his system
judging by the progress it made through
his bloodstream he was already dead
by the time somebody blew his face off
why would anyone do that
you sound like your boyfriend
leave the why to the cops and the shrinks
were just here to find cause of death
no more no less
you dont wanna see that
its alright
look whos easy now
you shouldve seen the look on your face
i cant wait to see the look on your face
when youre not getting laid tonight
hold on hold on not even if i ply you
with popcorn and sourpatch kids
youre lucky youre cute
how do you get used to that
you do and you dont
sheriff

found her in the basement
of the douglas place
no id no fingerprints in the system
no one has a clue who she is
i dont suppose you know
how she wound up there
stanley
damn thing gets meaner by the day
alvarez there was working
at paul and carols place
my best bet he killed our jane doe
needed a place to dump the body
didnt count the douglas
being home or paul having a 38
first thing tomorrow ill bring him in
but for now shes the priority
still it would have been nice
to take a look at the crime scene
i got four people dead and no
goddamn clue how any of it connects
nobodys pissin in your grits here shel
but we do have protocol
press is gonna need answers on this
in the morning and i got nothing
now theyll buy a 1079
i can give them a b and e gone haywire
but what i cant sell is her
time frame
its gotta be tonight
okay
you didnt have to come back
i know
this is the autopsy of an unidentified
female henceforth known as jane doe
performing the autopsy will be myself
tommy tilden attending coroner
i will be assisted by austin tilden
certified medical technician
this autopsy will be conducted
in four stages
beginning with an external evaluation
followed by an internal evaluation
of the heart and lungs
the digestive organs
and finally the brain
weve got some beautiful weather here
for the next few days
subject is in her mid to late 20s
appears to be
subject appears to be in her mid to late 20s
caucasian skin appears normal
no outwards signs of bleeding or bruising
no scarring
no distinctive external markings
hair brown
eyes
grey
you dont see clouding like that
unless a bodys been dead for days
theres no lividity
no rigor mortis either
when do you think she died
well shes colder
than the ambient temperature
what conditions at the scene
could be confounding factors
look how small her waist is like it
doesnt really fit the rest of her frame
could be congenital
we wont know until we open her up
mark it down on the board
well come back to it later
her wrists and ankles are fractured
how do you break your wrists and ankles
without any outward signs
i see it all the time simple fractures
simple
her joints are shattered
what is that what is it dirt
no no this is denser
heavier
its this is peat
havent seen this stuff in ages
its under her toenails too
yeah there are trace amounts in the hair
shes covered in it
like maybe she was buried in it
where do you even find peat
you buy it at a nursery
but naturally in the ground
up north not around here
nasal passages no sign of inflammation
no fluid and no foreign substances
and ear canals are
clear
i hadnt expected that
tongue has been
severed
crudely non surgically
she could have bitten it off you know
she ods on something tensed up
these arent bite marks see striations
ive seen something like this before
about 15 years back
human trafficking around norfolk
two girls
hands and feet
bound tight
to keep them from running
cut out their tongues
for making too much noise
you think this was some kind
of a prostitution thing
cant rule it out
here she has a molar missing
on the lower left side
take some impressions
its definitely some kind of fabric
bag it
send it to the lab
no external seminal fluid present
give me a swab
shes torn up inside
there are ridges grooves in the tissue
abrasions
no cuts
deliberate
severed tongue shattered joints
vaginal trauma
the theory tracks
were barely out of the external
we got a ways to go
well now proceed
with the internal examination
starting with the heart and lungs
help me with the block
theyre not supposed
to bleed like that right
ive seen it
but only on a fresh corpse
an hour dead maybe two
its caused by a build up of pressure
what is that melanoma maybe
on the inside
possible
lets see what the lab comes back with
can you hand me the rib cutters
today
shit
what did you do
i got it
i need you to focus here
i got it
well
you were right
her waist doesnt fit her frame
its not congenital
then what is it
well if you wear one
long enough a corset
didnt those go out of style
a couple of hundred years ago
the lungs severely blackened
wouldnt have taken her for a smoker
she could smoke ten packs
a day for 30 years
wouldnt explain this
thats what killed her right
no this amount of lung damage though
id expect the body to be covered
in third degree burns
its like finding a
a bullet in the brain
but with no gunshot wound
her hearts marked up
almost like its been cut
well not just her heart
what do you think that is genetic defect
probably scar tissue
scar tissue
from what
imagine all this internal trauma
was reflected externally
shattered ankles and wrists
fireburned lungs scarred organs
what would she look like
shed be mangled
disfigured beyond recognition
but shes not
i mean how the hell do you even do this
if you wanna kill someone you shoot them
or poison them or drown them
a million easy ways
you dont go to these lengths
unless you wanna make them suffer
what the
ill get it
so clean
what happened to you
what the hell happened
are you okay
somethings in the vent
thanks
oh shit
give me a minute
what are you doing
the drawer
must have not closed it all the way
stanley was a pain in the ass
but he was your mothers
one of the few things of hers i had left
yeah i miss her too
right lets keep going
this is stage three
of the autopsy of jane doe
beginning with the stomach
and the gastrointestinal system
dad you can talk to me
im not keeping anything from you
you just you put up this act for people
im fine
alright
what is that
a flower
jimson weed paralyzing agent
probably explains
the inflammation on her organs
heres a weird thing
that settles it shes from up north
yeah but how did she end up here
one thing at a time
im just trying to make sense of all this
gusts are now being reported
at up to 60 miles per hour
rain is expected to top
three inches within the hour
this one might be a bigger deal
than we were led to believe
dad how about we just
finish this in the morning
burke needs a cod tonight
were not even close
when we start something we finish it
you wanna leave
leave
it looks like some kind of shroud
and old
stomach acids should have
dissolved this thing
i mean the fact that its intact
at all is amazing
now see what is that
roman numerals
okay
these numerals
the order t and and this s
it doesnt fit
what are you doing
someone pulled out her tooth wrapped it
in fabric and forced her to swallow it
and the drawing
i dont know religious
possibly ritualistic
well lets play that one out
every ritual has its purpose
what mo have we seen so far
first they bound her
then they ripped out her tongue
poisoned her paralyzed her
forced her to swallow the cloth
then the cuts
the internal mutilation stabs
then as if that wasnt enough
they burned her
almost like a human sacrifice
i got to tell you
we have serious weather reports
coming in from all the monitoring
stations across the state
weve got a flash flood warning now in
full effect for all of grantham county
theyve got concerns about
you cant kill someone this way
without leaving a trace on the outside
she doesnt even have a broken nail
if we could just find out
why she was tortured
down here if you cant see it
touch it it doesnt matter
now these bodies are not just cods dad
this happened to her for a reason
trust me when i tell you this is not
a storm you wanna get caught in folks
one things for sure
youre not going anywhere
hey dad
i think maybe we should get out of here

ray of sunshine
she thought it was corny as shit
but it stuck
if id have known i wouldve helped her
you know that dont you
i mean she was always so bright
so happy
to think she was carrying around all that
pain all that unhappiness every day
i shouldve seen it but i didnt
she had to deal with it alone
all these mistakes
my mistakes
and you had to pay for them
why hasnt she killed us yet
well its not for want of trying
well look what she can do
if she wanted us dead
when we cut into her
she tried to stop us each time
its like theres something
she doesnt want us to find
you wanna go back in there
if we stay here were dead
if we could just figure out how she died
maybe we can figure out how to stop her
dad
right behind you

austin
dad
no
dad
dad dad
come on come on
come on
okay
brain is normal
theres got to be something
all her other organs are scarred
what the fuck
what is it
thats why we couldnt find cause of death
shes still alive
alive
we lit her on fire
we took out her heart
theres something some energy
call it what you want
something is keeping her going
what the
leviticus
let me see that
leviticus
twenty twenty seven
if these are roman numerals then theyd be
any man or woman
who consults the spirits of the dead
shall be put to death for they are
dad
seventeenth century
north east
new england
they are a witch
and their blood shall be
on their own heads
it fits
witches are a myth
you cant keep denying
there were no witches in salem
they were kids young girls
falsely accused wrapped up in hysteria
one pointing to the next
who pointed to the next
but they were all all innocent
only
they didnt hang her
or burn her at the stake
they tortured her
mercilessly
the ritual
didnt work
what if
what if the ritual
performed on an innocent
accidentally created
the very thing were trying to destroy
everything they did to her
everything weve done to her
she can feel it
she wants us
to feel it too
thats why shes keeping us alive
this is her revenge
this is
her ritual
but why us
why the douglas why anybody
were on her path thats all
we were just stops along the way
those who survived got rid of her
and buried her as far away as possible
that hasnt stopped her
because no one got close enough
no one could see
what we have seen
shes still suffering
and it wont stop
it wont stop until
until what
dad until what
i wont fight you
but please
please dont hurt him
let me help you
dad
