no relation to paul and carol 
who s she 
well  for now  she s a jane doe 
  you got something 
  nothing was stolen 
not a scratch on the outside
of the house either 
doesn t look like someone broke in 
to me  it looks like
they were trying to break out 
cause of death 
how about we skip this part tonight 
come on  this one s a soft ball 
smoke inhalation 
you re telling me
that smoke killed mr  howard 
well  damaged nasal passage 
damaged throat  damaged lungs   
damaged lungs  yes 
but incompatible with life 
  so  you re saying that s not the cod 
  i m saying look before you leap 
where did the police find the body 
  in his kitchen 
  house on fire 
front door is 30 feet away 
yet  he s not trying to get there 
lungs are damaged   
   but airways not denuded nearly enough 
so  he stopped breathing
before that fire really got going 
open him up 
now  now you see here 
  down below the occipital 
  a fracture 
  that explains the swelling in his brain 
  subdural hematoma 
that s what did it  not the smoke 
everybody has a secret 
some just hide them better than others 
some people are better at finding them 
you did good  you ll get there 
nobody s even claimed him yet 
  he was all alone  that s why he died 
  he died because he fell and hit his head 
you got plans tonight 
emma wants to go see a movie at the strand 
i thought they d closed that place down 
no  when was the last time
you even went to go see a movie  dad 
she has alzheimer s
and he s building her a house 
the notebook 
oh  yeah  your mother made me go
and see it with her for her birthday 
i fell asleep five minutes in 
yeah 
  are you alright finishing up 
  yeah 
what s up  tilden 
hematoma 
stanley 
hey  dad 
stanley got another one 
dad 
jesus christ 
  it s so easy 
  how d you get down here 
  the key was in the elevator 
  oh  my god 
i gotta say  this is not
what i was expecting 
you said it was old but wow 
i thought we were supposed to meet out front 
well  i got tired of waiting 
  where are you going 
  i m having a little look 
  come back 
  god  the place just keeps going 
well  three generations
of tildens keep expanding   
   end up with this
state of the art facility 
hey  come on 
  what s the rush 
  i ve been down here all day 
you got to see me at my job 
why can t i see you at yours 
you work at a book store 
  are these all people 
  just three tonight 
  can i see one 
  well  no  no  you cannot see one 
  why not 
  because there s   
     some things you can t un see  okay 
  come on  i can handle it 
no  no  and my dad is way too strict 
try me 
so  what ll it be 
are you serious 
  are you 
  hell yeah 
pick one 
not that one  the one next to it 
a body s a body 
yeah  well  i pick that one 
  what s that for 
  to make sure he s dead 
there used to be a time it was hard to tell
a comatose person from a dead one 
so coroners tied bells
to everybody in the morgue 
so if they heard a  ting  they knew somebody
down there wasn t quite ready to go 
  so  why do you have one 
  well  i m   
   i m a bit of a traditionalist 
  why did you cover his face 
  there wasn t much of a face left to cover 
point blank gun shot blast tend to do that 
who shot him 
angle of entry suggests he did it to himself 
until we found strychnine in his system 
judging by the progress it made through
his bloodstream he was already dead   
   by the time somebody blew his face off 
  why would anyone do that 
  you sound like your boyfriend 
leave the  why  to the cops and the shrinks 
we re just here to find cause of death 
no more  no less 
you don t wanna see that 
it s alright 
look who s easy now 
you should ve seen the look on your face 
i can t wait to see the look on your face
when you re not getting laid tonight 
hold on  hold on  not even if i ply you
with popcorn and sourpatch kids 
you re lucky you re cute 
how do you get used to that 
you do and you don t 
sheriff

  dad  if you need me to stay   
  oh  don t worry about it 
you two go have your fun

i mean  he wouldn t be here

  here we go 
  well  my dad

hey  you think i wanna be here  down there 
this isn t my life  i don t wanna be
austin tilden  the morgue worker 
just    he needs my help right now 
come on  it s been two years 
he can take care of himself 
come back in a few hours 
we ll catch the midnight show

and don t  you know  don t smile
because a smile means  yes   you know 
i know it s in there 
now  you re gonna blow your whole game 
maybe 
you re hot 
found her in the basement
of the douglas  place 
no id  no fingerprints in the system 
no one has a clue who she is 
i don t suppose you know
how she wound up there 
stanley 
damn thing gets meaner by the day 
alvarez there was working
at paul and carol s place 
my best bet  he killed our jane doe 
needed a place to dump the body 
didn t count the douglas 
being home or paul having a  38 
first thing tomorrow  i ll bring him in
but for now she s the priority 
still  it would have been nice
to take a look at the crime scene 
i got four people dead and no
goddamn clue how any of it connects 
nobody s pissin  in your grits here  shel 
but we do have protocol 
press is gonna need answers on this
in the morning and i got nothing 
now they ll buy a 10 79 
i can give them a  b and e gone haywire 
but what i can t sell is her 
time frame 
  it s gotta be tonight 
  okay 
you didn t have to come back 
i know 
this is the autopsy of an unidentified
female henceforth known as  jane doe  
performing the autopsy will be myself 
tommy tilden  attending coroner 
i will be assisted by austin tilden 
certified medical technician 
this autopsy will be conducted
in four stages 
beginning with an external evaluation   
   followed by an internal evaluation
of the heart and lungs   
   the digestive organs
and finally  the brain 
we ve got some beautiful weather here
for the next few days 
subject is in her mid to late 20s 
appears to be 
subject appears to be in her mid to late 20s 
caucasian  skin appears normal 
no outwards signs of bleeding or bruising 
no scarring 
no distinctive external markings 
hair  brown 
eyes   
   grey 
you don t see clouding like that
unless a body s been dead for days 
there s no lividity 
no rigor mortis either 
when do you think she died 
well  she s colder
than the ambient temperature 
  what  conditions at the scene 
  could be confounding factors 
look how small her waist is  like it
doesn t really fit the rest of her frame 
could be congenital 
we won t know until we open her up 
mark it down on the board 
we ll come back to it later 
her wrists and ankles are fractured 
how do you break your wrists and ankles   
   without any outward signs 
  i see it all the time  simple fractures 
  simple 
her joints are shattered 
what is that  what is it  dirt 
no  no  this is denser 
heavier 
it s    this is peat 
haven t seen this stuff in ages 
it s under her toenails  too 
yeah  there are trace amounts in the hair 
she s covered in it 
like  maybe she was buried in it 
  where do you even find peat 
  you buy it at a nursery 
but naturally in the ground   
   up north  not around here 
nasal passages  no sign of inflammation 
no fluid and no foreign substances   
   and ear canals are   
   clear 
i hadn t expected that 
  tongue has been   
  severed 
crudely  non surgically 
she could have bitten it off  you know 
she ods on something  tensed up   
these aren t bite marks  see  striations 
i ve seen something like this before   
   about 15 years back 
human trafficking around norfolk 
two girls   
   hands and feet   
   bound tight   
   to keep them from running 
cut out their tongues
for making too much noise   
you think this was some kind
of a prostitution thing 
can t rule it out 
here  she has a molar missing
on the lower left side 
take some impressions 
it s definitely some kind of fabric 
bag it 
send it to the lab 
no external seminal fluid present 
give me a swab 
she s torn up inside 
there are ridges  grooves in the tissue 
  abrasions 
  no  cuts 
deliberate 
severed tongue  shattered joints 
vaginal trauma   
the theory tracks 
we re barely out of the external 
we got a ways to go 
we ll now proceed
with the internal examination   
   starting with the heart and lungs 
help me with the block 
they re not supposed
to bleed like that  right 
i ve seen it 
but only on a fresh corpse 
an hour dead  maybe two 
it s caused by a build up of pressure 
what is that  melanoma maybe 
on the inside 
possible 
let s see what the lab comes back with 
can you hand me the rib cutters 
today 
shit 
  what did you do 
  i got it 
i need you to focus here 
i got it 
well   
   you were right 
her waist doesn t fit her frame 
  it s not congenital 
  then what is it 
well  if you wear one
long enough  a corset   
didn t those go out of style
a couple of hundred years ago 
the lungs severely blackened 
wouldn t have taken her for a smoker 
she could smoke ten packs
a day for 30 years   
   wouldn t explain this 
that s what killed her  right 
no  this amount of lung damage  though   
i d expect the body to be covered
in third degree burns 
it s like finding a   
a bullet in the brain   
   but with no gunshot wound 
her heart s marked up 
almost like it s been cut 
well  not just her heart 
what do you think that is  genetic defect 
  probably scar tissue 
  scar tissue 
from what 
imagine all this internal trauma   
   was reflected externally 
shattered ankles and wrists   
   fire burned lungs  scarred organs 
  what would she look like 
  she d be mangled 
disfigured beyond recognition   
   but she s not 
i mean  how the hell do you even do this 
if you wanna kill someone  you shoot them
or poison them or drown them 
a million easy ways 
you don t go to these lengths   
   unless you wanna make them suffer 
  what the   
  i ll get it 
so clean 
what happened to you 
what the hell happened 
  are you okay 
  something s in the vent 
thanks 
oh  shit 
give me a minute 
what are you doing 
the drawer   
   must have not closed it all the way 
stanley was a pain in the ass 
but he was your mother s 
one of the few things of hers i had left 
  yeah  i miss her  too 
  right  let s keep going 
this is stage three
of the autopsy of jane doe 
beginning with the stomach
and the gastro intestinal system 
dad  you can talk to me 
i m not keeping anything from you 
you just    you put up this act for people   
i m fine 
alright 
what is that 
a flower 
jimson weed  paralyzing agent 
probably explains
the inflammation on her organs 
here s a weird thing 
that settles it  she s from up north 
yeah  but how did she end up here 
one thing at a time 
i m just trying to make sense of all this 
gusts are now being reported
at up to 60 miles per hour 
rain is expected to top
three inches within the hour 
this one might be a bigger deal
than we were led to believe 
dad  how about we just   
finish this in the morning 
burke needs a cod tonight 
we re not even close 
when we start something  we finish it 
you wanna leave   
   leave 
it looks like some kind of shroud 
and old 
stomach acids should have
dissolved this thing 
i mean  the fact that it s intact
at all is amazing 
now see  what is that 
roman numerals 
okay 
these numerals 
the order  t and    and this s 
it doesn t fit 
what are you doing 
someone pulled out her tooth  wrapped it
in fabric and forced her to swallow it 
and the drawing 
i don t know  religious 
possibly    ritualistic 
well  let s play that one out 
every ritual has its purpose 
what mo have we seen so far 
first they bound her 
then they ripped out her tongue   
   poisoned her  paralyzed her   
   forced her to swallow the cloth 
then the cuts   
   the internal mutilation  stabs 
then as if that wasn t enough 
they burned her 
almost like a human sacrifice 
i got to tell you 
we have serious weather reports
coming in from all the monitoring
stations across the state 
we ve got a flash flood warning now in
full effect for all of grantham county 
they ve got concerns about   
you can t kill someone this way
without leaving a trace on the outside 
she doesn t even have a broken nail 
if we could just find out
why she was tortured   
down here  if you can t see it 
touch it  it doesn t matter 
now  these bodies are not just cods  dad 
this happened to her for a reason 
trust me when i tell you  this is not
a storm you wanna get caught in  folks 
one thing s for sure 
you re not going anywhere 
hey  dad 
i think maybe we should get out of here 
help me with this 
holy shit 
what the fuck 
dad  dad 
here 
let s get the fuck out of here 
come on  come on 
the generator 
there s not enough power 
it s stuck

wheeled her through that door 
  son   
  until we cut into her 
you re talking about a corpse 
these things we found inside her

inside  those were impossible 
whatever the hell happened in here   
   we are way past possible 
it s her 
so  what do we do 
  rapid decomp 
  everything we took out of her 
that s almost like her body

all this is my fault 
  you couldn t have known 
  yeah 
yeah  that s what everyone told me   
   about your mom 
you know why i used to call her ray 
ray of sunshine 
she thought it was corny as shit 
but it stuck 
if i d have known  i would ve helped her 
you know that  don t you 
i mean  she was always so bright 
so happy 
to think she was carrying around all that   
   pain  all that unhappiness every day 
i should ve seen it  but i didn t 
she had to deal with it alone 
all these mistakes   
   my mistakes   
   and you had to pay for them 
why hasn t she killed us yet 
well  it s not for want of trying 
well  look what she can do   
   if she wanted us dead 
when we cut into her   
   she tried to stop us each time 
it s like there s something
she doesn t want us to find 
  you wanna go back in there 
  if we stay here  we re dead 
if we could just figure out how she died   
   maybe we can figure out how to stop her 
  dad 
  right behind you 
keep moving 
austin 
dad 
no 
dad 
dad  dad 
come on  come on 
come on 
okay 
brain    is normal 
there s got to be something 
all her other organs are scarred 
  what the fuck 
  what is it 
that s why we couldn t find cause of death 
she s still alive 
alive 
we lit her on fire 
we took out her heart 
there s something  some energy 
call it what you want 
something is keeping her going 
what the   
leviticus 
let me see that 
leviticus 
twenty  twenty seven 
if these are roman numerals then they d be   
   1693 
 any man or woman
who consults the spirits of the dead    
    shall be put to death for they are    
dad 
seventeenth century 
north east 
new england 
 they are a witch    
    and their blood shall be
on their own heads  
it fits 
witches are a myth 
you can t keep denying 
there were no witches in salem 
they were kids  young girls 
falsely accused  wrapped up in hysteria   
   one pointing to the next 
who pointed to the next   
   but they were all  all innocent 
only   
   they didn t hang her   
   or burn her at the stake 
they tortured her   
     mercilessly 
  the ritual   
didn t work 
what if   
what if the ritual 
performed on an innocent   
   accidentally created   
   the very thing we re trying to destroy 
everything they did to her 
everything we ve done to her 
she can feel it 
she wants us   
   to feel it too 
that s why she s keeping us alive 
this is her revenge 
this is   
   her ritual 
but why us 
why the douglas   why anybody 
we re on her path  that s all 
we were just stops along the way 
those who survived got rid of her   
   and buried her as far away as possible 
that hasn t stopped her 
because no one got close enough 
no one could see   
   what we have seen 
she s still suffering   
   and it won t stop 
it won t stop until   
until what 
dad  until what 
i won t fight you 
but please
