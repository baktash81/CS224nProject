please juliet tell me what i should do
my heart is breaking

i think she came back
to find her one true love
and they had 10 children
and still make passionate love every night
except he got bald and fat
and she has to do all the work
francesca
francesca
and maybe she stayed in london

mmmhmm
i had the most amazing day
i got to answer a letter
that was written 50 years ago
i know it might not get there
but it just feels so good to write
yeah i think you should spend more time

wine auction thats happening in livorno
in livorno

listen to
what this poor girl writes
juliet is there anything worse
in this world than a man
excuse me
lm sorry to interrupt

yes thats us
great
may i ask which one of you wrote this letter
to my grandmother claire smith
i wrote that
and i cant believe that it found you
yes we brits tend to stay
in our family homes
yeah this is amazing
its less than a week since i mailed it
it was a very thoughtful letter
now what were you thinking
i was thinking that she deserved an answer
yeah 50 years ago maybe not now
lm sorry i didnt know true love
had an expiration date
true love are you joking
could you imagine what wouldve happened
if she hadnt seen sense
well yeah you wouldnt be here
and that would be an upside
what are you doing here anyway
what are you some lonely american girl
who has to live vicariously through others
lm not lonely i am engaged
my condolences to the groom
excuse me
so thats it youve come all the way
from london to give me a lecture
no i came because i couldnt let
my grandmother come on her own
claire is here why
i think even you might be able
to work that one out
oh my god
thats awesome
shes come to find her lorenzo
awesome
and if lorenzo doesnt want to see her
has forgotten her
is gravely ill or dead
lets say just for fun then what
thought so
i want to meet her ld like to meet claire
and i want to play for manchester united
but lm shit at football
you dont think that she wants to meet me
i honestly think
she has no interest meeting a woman
that can manage to jam oh my god
and awesome into the same sentence
gran theyre closing up
we should go now
excuse me claire hi hi
my name is sophie
and i wrote you the letter
letter from juliet
goodness thank you
thank you but however did you find us
well your grandson found me actually
you did
right well the thing is
i thought we should
yeah well hes very sweet
and very charming and he thought
that you might like to meet me
uncharacteristically thoughtful of you dear
yes well under the circumstances
it seems a little churlish not
to meet the woman responsible
for this voyage of lunacy
okay
charlie doesnt approve
which makes this all the more fun
we were just going for a glass of wine
would you like to join us
absolutely not
what
absolutely not
its been a long day its too long a day
okay darling have a good sleep
but i
do you know somewhere we could go
i actually have the perfect place
i cant believe youre really here
i was taking an art course in tuscany
staying with a family outside siena
and they had a son lorenzo
and it was love at first sight
he had such gentle blue eyes
and he told me i was very beautiful
and he gave me this ring
we wanted to get married
but ld got exams back in england
and my parents would never have agreed
and i got scared
and i ran away
now
what i really want is to
tell him that lm so sorry
i was such a coward
of course a card or letter is just too simple
so youve come to find your lorenzo
yes and i think i know where he is
where
on the farm just near siena
charlies driving me down tomorrow
only because i didnt want you to hitchhike
well he thinks its a big mistake
because you dont have a romantic bone
in your body
no no its because i am a realist
no because you are an englishman
cold as fish
right and who was it
that wrote romeo and juliet
williamo shakespearelli a great italian
theyre mad theyre mad
sophie my dear
good night thank you so much
thank you
good night good night everybody
good night
charlie lets go
good night ladies ciao
good luck

ciao
how wonderful would it be
if she found her romeo
imagine if she did 50 years later
all because you found that letter
nobody would believe it
if it werent true you know
wait wait
oh for here she comes
sorry
may i come with you to find lorenzo
come with us
what about this fiancé of yours
youre in the city of love
and you want to come with us
yes i do because hes busy and lm free
and i mean
of course if its not an intrusion
no no its not an intrusion
i just listen
i do have one thing to tell you first
its not an intrusion
this is not entirely selfless
it started out as a simple reply
to your letter
and now i think its so amazing
what youre doing
and ld love to write about it if its okay
a journalist
gran a journalist
trying to pry into our private lives
charlie come on
its hardly state secrets is it
lm not a journalist
i would like to be some day but
and you think grans story is your ticket
i think its a story worth telling
ld love to have you with us
really
yes of course
we would
how much time
did you actually spend with lorenzo
every second that we could
ld go to meet him after class
to the farm where he was working
and wed sit under the trees and wed share
some bread with tomatoes and olive oil
its so romantic
yeah
whats so romantic about eating in the dirt
really
the dirt
well you see he loved the earth
he loved talking to me about the rain
and the springs of fresh water
and wed walk for miles and miles
wed lie in the dry grass
i can still remember
the smell of his sweet hot sweat and
okay okay gran we get the picture
so you must feel like youre about
to find your longlost soul mate
yes
her soul mate was my grandfather
lets not invalidate my entire existence
okay lm sorry i just
thats clearly not what i meant
charlies just like my husband
both skeptics
my husband always insisted
that love was nothing but hormones
but you see underneath
he had such a warm passionate heart
and charlies just the same
tell me about the guy youre in love with
victor
yeah
well victor is a chef an amazing chef
wow
yeah hes opening his own restaurant

human rights helping refugees get asylum

lm so surprised
i just didnt have you pinned down
as the savehumanity type at all
really
and what type did you have me
pinned down for exactly
well i was leaning towards
elitist oxford prig
but now that you mention it
selfsatisfied dogooder works as well

of character then
but she does deal with facts charlie

good night
forgive me where are my manners
you know lve been wondering that
since i met you
yes well i dont know what it is
but you seem to bring out
the very worst in me
somehow its my fault
all of this is your fault
you wrote that blasted letter
nonetheless may i walk you to your room
you know lm not the buttonedup
buttockclenching killjoy
you try to make me out as
right and i made you argue that
true love is bollocks
guilty
its just that lm genuinely worried for her
i know she may seem carefree
but her life hasnt been all that simple
is it that unreasonable for me to worry
no but i have a really good feeling
about this youll see
lets hope youre right
signora claire
signor bartolini
were not done yet
of course were not darling
hello
hello
hello
hi is claire with you no
no no shes turned in early actually
okay
i was gonna ask if you wanted dinner but
i just i wanted to get started on my story
hows it coming
its coming okay
am i in it
you may be why
can i read just a little bit
are you kidding me
come on just a little bit
absolutely not
how am i to be sure that
lm being properly portrayed
no you are believe me you are
whats that supposed to mean
it means good night charlie
good night
okay
yeah
good night
what okay
is this
one of those situations
where youre really saying the opposite
of what you actually mean
no
right
good night then
good night charlie
good morning
gran wants to sleep in this morning
is she okay
i mean does she need anything
no need
shes tough as old boots that one
churchill in a dress
so i thought ld see a bit of siena
since were here
its a good idea
i suppose you want to keep on writing
i mean
work work work
admirable trait
right of course carry on then
charlie
since were here
i hate to compliment you but what
youre doing for claire is really
its sweet and i
i imagine that youd rather be spending
your holiday elsewhere
so did you volunteer your services or did
your parents i mean where do they fit in
ld like to think theyre someplace nice
they were killed in a car accident
when i was 10
lm sorry
god lm sorry
thank you sophie i appreciate it
it was a difficult time
gran lost her son
i lost my parents
lm not a big believer in happy endings
lm afraid
anyway gran stepped in took an angry
obnoxious young boy under her wing
and made me the simply unpleasant man
i am today
so isnt your fiancé
starting to get just a tad lonely
you know victors having
the time of his life right now
and i doubt he even notices that lm gone
what about you
dont you have a girlfriend
that is a very very long story
yeah lm not surprised
its been about a year
since lve seen patricia
and you broke up with her
are you insinuating that lm more the type
to be dumped rather than do the dumping
maybe i am
actually i did break up with patricia
this time
okay thats enough
all right thats enough
sophie
thats enough
your writing is really good
thank you
no its really really really good
why are you so surprised
how come youve never shown
your work to anyone
i never feel like its finished
why
because i guess lm a perfectionist
you know thats just another way
of saying lm a chicken
listen youve got nothing to be afraid of
youre not a fact checker youre a writer
what was that for
lm not a chicken
and lm not a gentleman
do you think we should get back to claire
yeah many more lorenzos
okay
we should get back to claire
i am lorenzo bartolini
take him take him
i am lorenzo bartolini
wow
i am lorenzo bartolini
do you know what you are
you are the montagues and the capulets
you mean well at least lm not romeo
thats the understatement of the century
no no no because you see
if i found the love of my life
i wouldnt stand there like an idiot
whispering in a garden
i would just grab her from that
blasted balcony and be done with it
do you believe in destiny
do you
yeah i think so
i think its destiny that lm here right now
with claire
of course of course with claire
well this is the street
well theres 2 heres number 2
this is what i feared the most
charlie we dont even know if its him
i hope its not i hope its not
either way were finished were done
no not here
when do we stop
over the next hill or the next
scour the whole country
no no it ends here
there are other lorenzos
not too far away from here
its not the ending you want is it
this isnt just a clever story
with a clever ending
stop it charlie
its our life its my grans life
its not about
charlie its not about a story
no no no shes already lost the man once
how many more times
would you have her lose him
you know what
i dont expect you to understand any of this
because you dont know a thing
about real loss
yeah
youre wrong
sophies mother ran away from her
when she was a little girl
its different gran its different
youre right
but
sophies mother chose to leave her
and you always knew your mum and dad
loved you
come in
hi
oh dear
i just wanted to see if you were all right

on behalf of myself and my lovely wife
la mia bella claire
and now its your turn
well
go on
dear friends
50 years ago
i went to juliets house in verona
i wrote her a letter
and i asked her a question
and two months ago i received a reply
and without that letter
none of us would be here today
sophie would you mind
if i read out the words you wrote to me
all right
dear claire what and if
are two words as nonthreatening
as words can be
but put them together side by side
and they have the power
to haunt you for the rest of your life
what if
i dont know how your story ended
but if what you felt then was true love
then its never too late
if it was true then
why wouldnt it be true now
you need only the courage
to follow your heart
i dont know
what a love like juliets feels like
a love to leave loved ones for
a love to cross oceans for
but ld like to believe
if i ever were to feel it
that ld have the courage to seize it
and claire if you didnt
i hope one day that you will
all my love
juliet
ill be right back all right gran
sophie
of course
a balcony
well
what are you doing up there
lm gonna go
why
because this is really painful
i should have realized sooner but i didnt
or i guess maybe i couldnt
but victor and i arent together anymore
and i guess i came back hoping that
wait wait youre not engaged
no
but its too late
its clearly too late
and it really doesnt matter anymore
because honestly
i love you
i cant believe i just said that
but i do i love you it doesnt
i mean it shouldnt matter to you
because youre here with patricia
patricia
and you should be back with her right now
patricia is my cousin shes my cousin
how is that legal
no
sophie no
no no no let me explain
sophie lm so stupid theres two patricias
theres my cousin whos here
and the one
that lve completely forgotten about
more importantly theres only one sophie
now would you please come down
wait charlie charlie stop
what are you doing
charlie what are you doing
listen to me
listen to me very very carefully
i live in london a gorgeous vibrant
historic city that i happen to love living in
you live in new york
which is highly overrated
pardon me
but since the atlantic ocean
is a bit wide to cross every day
swimming boating or flying
i suggest we flip for it
what are you saying
and if those terms are unacceptable
leaving london will be a pleasure
as long as youre waiting for me
on the other side
cause the truth is sophie
i am madly deeply truly
passionately in love with you
you are
i am
are you gonna kiss me
yeah
yeah
oh my god
charlie
i cant believe i just did that
hi

can you move
only my lips
what if we were made for each other
born to become best friends and lovers
i want to stay right here
in this moment with you
over and over and over again
what if this could be a real love
a love a love yeah
i dont know what to think
is this real or just a dream
in my heart is where youll be
ill keep waiting till we meet
what if we were made for each other
born to become best friends and lovers
i want to stay right here
in this moment with you
over and over and over again
what if this could be a real love
