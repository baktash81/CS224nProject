they post them on the wall
in juliet s courtyard 
and then these secretaries come back
with this basket
and they retrieve the letters every day 
and then they write back  as juliet 
to all the letters
that have return addresses on them

how long have you

almost a year 
wow  and may i ask
why don t you wear an engagement ring 
yeah  see  that s    that s me  i insisted 
he was so busy  you know 
this whole restaurant and everything 
and i guess i felt it unnecessary 
still  a girl should have a ring 
 i didn t go to him  juliet 
 i didn t go to lorenzo 
 his eyes were so full of trust 
 i promised i d meet him
to run away together
 because my parents don t approve 
 but instead  i left him waiting for me 
below our tree 
 waiting and wondering where i was 
 l m in verona now 
 i return to london in the morning 
and l m so afraid 
 please  juliet  tell me what i should do 
 my heart is breaking 
and i have no one else to turn to 
 love  claire  
and it s been there for all those years 
i think she came back
to find her one true love 
and they had 10 children
and still make passionate love every night 
except he got bald and fat
and she has to do all the work 
  francesca 
  francesca 
and maybe she stayed in london
and married a duke
and lived happily ever after  just like me 
  but you married an accountant  not a duke 
  nobody s perfect 
and i bet when she s making love
to that duke   
  yeah 
   she s imagining her first love  lorenzo 
isabella  i have to write back 
then answer her 
good night  friends 
good night 
hey 
hey 
  sorry l m late 
  no  it s fine  no worries 
  how was your day  good 
  it was   
  it was so good 
  yeah 
  yeah 
  good  l m glad 
how was angelina 
yeah  it was good  i mean  she s amazing 
you know  that woman is incredible 
she s very instinctive  you know 
she cooks without recipes 
i mean  she s incredible 
  she s invited me to cook again 
  really 
yeah  yeah 
i think i can learn a lot from her 
but   
no  no  you first  you first  sorry  sorry 
  no  just real quick  i just   
  mmm hmm 
i had the most amazing day 
i got to answer a letter
that was written 50 years ago 
i know it might not get there 
but it just feels so good to write 
yeah  i think you should spend more time
with them 
  why 
  because it s your passion  right 
and also because it fits perfectly 
because i just got off the phone
with signor morini 
and he s invited me to this amazing
wine auction that s happening in livorno 
  in livorno 
  yeah  yeah  yeah 
it s super exclusive 
i mean  i don t know   
i don t know if i can get a ticket  you know 
i mean  l ll be off  like  a day or two  max 
if you want  l ll try to get two tickets 
  but l m not sure i can get two tickets 
  yeah 
to a wine auction  in livorno 
yeah  it sounds terrible  i know 
l m sorry  l m so    i feel terrible now 
i feel terrible  i mean  it s   
i miss you already  you know 
  i ll be back very soon  okay 
  yeah  be careful 
bye  ciao 
listen to
what this poor girl writes 
 juliet  is there anything worse
in this world than a man  
excuse me 
l m sorry to interrupt 
but are you the secretaries of juliet 
  yes  that s us 
  great 
may i ask  which one of you wrote this letter
to my grandmother  claire smith 
i wrote that 
and i can t believe that it found you 
yes  we brits tend to stay
in our family homes 
yeah  this is amazing 
it s less than a week since i mailed it 
it was a very thoughtful letter 
now  what were you thinking 
i was thinking that she deserved an answer 
yeah  50 years ago  maybe  not now 
l m sorry  i didn t know true love
had an expiration date 
true love  are you joking 
could you imagine what would ve happened
if she hadn t seen sense 
well  yeah  you wouldn t be here 
and that would be an upside 
what are you doing here anyway 
what  are you some lonely american girl
who has to live vicariously through others 
l m not lonely  i am engaged 
my condolences to the groom 
excuse me 
so that s it  you ve come all the way
from london to give me a lecture 
no  i came because i couldn t let
my grandmother come on her own 
claire is here  why 
i think even you might be able
to work that one out 
oh  my god 
that s awesome 
she s come to find her lorenzo 
awesome 
and if lorenzo doesn t want to see her 
has forgotten her 
is gravely ill or dead 
let s say  just for fun  then what 
thought so 
i want to meet her  l d like to meet claire 
and i want to play for manchester united 
but l m shit at football 
you don t think that she wants to meet me 
i honestly think
she has no interest meeting a woman
that can manage to jam   oh  my god 
and  awesome  into the same sentence 
gran  they re closing up 
we should go now 
excuse me  claire  hi  hi 
my name is sophie 
and i wrote you the letter 
letter  from juliet 
goodness  thank you 
thank you  but however did you find us 
  well  your grandson found me  actually 
  you did 
right  well  the thing is 
  i thought we should   
  yeah  well  he s very sweet
and very charming  and he thought
that you might like to meet me 
uncharacteristically thoughtful of you  dear 
yes  well  under the circumstances 
it seems a little churlish not
to meet the woman responsible
  for this voyage of lunacy 
  okay 
charlie doesn t approve 
which makes this all the more fun 
we were just going for a glass of wine 
would you like to join us 
absolutely not 
  what 
  absolutely not 
it s been a long day  it s too long a day 
  okay  darling  have a good sleep 
  but i   
do you know somewhere we could go 
i actually have the perfect place 
i can t believe you re really here 
i was taking an art course in tuscany 
staying with a family outside siena 
and they had a son lorenzo 
and it was love at first sight 
he had such gentle blue eyes 
and he told me i was very beautiful 
and he gave me this ring 
we wanted to get married 
but l d got exams back in england
and my parents would never have agreed 
and i got scared 
and i ran away 
now
what i really want is to
tell him that l m so sorry
i was such a coward 
of course  a card or letter is just too simple 
so  you ve come to find your lorenzo 
yes  and i think i know where he is 
where 
on the farm  just near siena 
charlie s driving me down tomorrow 
only because i didn t want you to hitchhike 
well  he thinks it s a big mistake 
because you don t have a romantic bone
in your body 
no  no  it s because i am a realist 
no  because you are an englishman 
cold as fish 
right  and who was it
that wrote romeo and juliet 
williamo shakespearelli  a great italian 
they re mad  they re mad 
sophie  my dear 
good night  thank you so much 
thank you 
good night  good night  everybody 
  good night 
  charlie  let s go 
  good night  ladies  ciao 
  good luck 
  bye 
  ciao 
how wonderful would it be
if she found her romeo 
imagine if she did  50 years later 
all because you found that letter 
nobody would believe it
if it weren t true  you know 
wait  wait 
  oh  for    here she comes 
  sorry 
  may i come with you to find lorenzo 
  come with us 
what about this fiancé of yours 
you re in the city of love
and you want to come with us 
yes  i do  because he s busy and l m free 
and i mean   
  of course  if it s not an intrusion 
  no  no  it s not an intrusion 
i just    listen 
  i do have one thing to tell you first 
  it s not an intrusion 
this is not entirely selfless 
it started out as a simple reply
to your letter 
and now i think it s so amazing
what you re doing 
  and l d love to write about it if it s okay 
  a journalist 
gran  a journalist
trying to pry into our private lives 
charlie  come on 
it s hardly state secrets  is it 
l m not a journalist 
i would like to be some day  but   
and you think gran s story is your ticket 
i think it s a story worth telling 
l d love to have you with us 
  really 
  yes  of course 
we would 
how much time
did you actually spend with lorenzo 
every second that we could 
l d go to meet him after class 
to the farm where he was working 
and we d sit under the trees and we d share
some bread with tomatoes and olive oil 
  it s so romantic 
  yeah 
what s so romantic about eating in the dirt 
really 
the dirt 
well  you see  he loved the earth 
he loved talking to me about the rain
and the springs of fresh water 
and we d walk for miles and miles 
we d lie in the dry grass 
i can still remember
the smell of his sweet  hot sweat and   
okay  okay  gran  we get the picture 
so you must feel like you re about
to find your long lost soul mate 
yes 
her soul mate was my grandfather 
let s not invalidate my entire existence 
okay  l m sorry  i just   
that s clearly not what i meant 
charlie s just like my husband 
both skeptics 
my husband always insisted
that love was nothing but hormones 
but you see  underneath 
he had such a warm  passionate heart 
and charlie s just the same 
tell me about the guy you re in love with 
victor 
yeah 
  well  victor is a chef  an amazing chef 
  wow 
yeah  he s opening his own restaurant
in new york 
and that s the reason we re here 
we re meeting suppliers all around 
and he s actually    he s in livorno
at a wine auction as we speak 
that sounds fun 
for him  yeah 
well  and do your parents like him 
yeah  my dad  my dad likes him 
my mom left us when i was nine 
oh  dear 
  oh  dear  l m sorry about that 
  that s okay  it was a really long time ago 
slowly  slowly 
how do you want to go about this 
ring the doorbell 
what if the wife answers
and goes into a fit of jealous rage  gran 
well  l d be flattered 
l m more worried that
he won t remember me 
right  let s go home then  gran 
before this all ends in tears 
come on  there s no one in 
l m gonna check the back 
there s no    we made our best effort 
there s no need to prolong
the disappointment 
it s me  yeah 
good afternoon  l m charlie wyman

  and sophie 
  ciao 
l m claire  do you remember 
claire 
it s not him

but now that you mention it 
self satisfied do gooder works  as well 
i guess you re a poor judge
of character then 
but she does deal with facts  charlie 
okay 
  l m off to bed 
  okay 
  good night  darling 
  good night  sleep well 
  may i walk you to your room 
  be nice to each other 
she is awesome 
i respect your usage of the word
this one instance 
oh  l m flattered  thank you for approving 
you re very welcome 
right  well  should we hit the sack 
sorry  i guess i   
well  as much as l d love to sit here
and drink the whole bottle of caparzo   
no  go to bed  you should 
good night  charlie 
right 
  well  good night 
  good night 
forgive me  where are my manners 
you know  l ve been wondering that
since i met you 
yes  well  i don t know what it is 
but you seem to bring out
the very worst in me 
  somehow it s my fault 
  all of this is your fault 
you wrote that blasted letter 
nonetheless  may i walk you to your room 
you know  l m not the buttoned up 
buttock clenching killjoy
you try to make me out as 
right  and i made you argue that
true love is bollocks 
guilty 
it s just that l m genuinely worried for her 
i know she may seem carefree 
but her life hasn t been all that simple 
is it that unreasonable for me to worry 
no  but i have a really good feeling
about this  you ll see 
let s hope you re right 
signora claire 
signor bartolini 
we re not done yet 
of course we re not  darling 
hello 
  hello 
  hello 
hi  is claire with you  no 
no  no  she s turned in early  actually 
okay 
i was gonna ask if you wanted dinner  but   
i just    i wanted to get started on my story 
how s it coming 
it s coming okay 
am i in it 
  you may be  why 
  can i read just a little bit 
  are you kidding me 
  come on  just a little bit 
absolutely not 
how am i to be sure that
l m being properly portrayed 
no  you are  believe me  you are 
  what s that supposed to mean 
  it means good night  charlie 
  good night 
  okay 
yeah 
good night 
  what  okay 
  is this
one of those situations
where you re really saying the opposite
of what you actually mean 
no 
right 
good night then 
good night  charlie 
good morning 
gran wants to sleep in this morning 
is she okay 
i mean  does she need anything 
no need 
she s tough as old boots  that one 
churchill in a dress 
so  i thought l d see a bit of siena
since we re here 
it s a good idea 
i suppose you want to keep on writing 
i mean   
work  work  work 
admirable trait 
right  of course  carry on then 
charlie 
since we re here   
i hate to compliment you  but what
you re doing for claire is really   
it s sweet  and i   
i imagine that you d rather be spending
your holiday elsewhere 
so did you volunteer your services  or did
your parents  i mean  where do they fit in 
l d like to think they re someplace nice 
they were killed in a car accident
when i was 10 
l m sorry 
god  l m sorry 
thank you  sophie  i appreciate it 
it was a difficult time 
gran lost her son 
i lost my parents 
l m not a big believer in happy endings 
l m afraid 
anyway  gran stepped in  took an angry 
obnoxious  young boy under her wing
and made me the simply unpleasant man
i am today 
so  isn t your fiancé
starting to get just a tad lonely 
you know  victor s having
the time of his life right now 
and i doubt he even notices that l m gone 
what about you 
  don t you have a girlfriend 
  that is a very  very long story 
yeah  l m not surprised 
it s been about a year
since l ve seen patricia 
and you broke up with her 
are you insinuating that l m more the type
to be dumped rather than do the dumping 
maybe i am 
actually  i did break up with patricia 
this time 
okay  that s enough 
all right  that s enough 
  sophie   
  that s enough 
  your writing is really good 
  thank you 
no  it s really  really  really good 
why are you so surprised 
how come you ve never shown
your work to anyone 
  i never feel like it s finished 
  why 
because i guess l m a perfectionist 
you know that s just another way
of saying  l m a chicken  
listen  you ve got nothing to be afraid of 
you re not a fact checker  you re a writer 
  what was that for 
  l m not a chicken 
  and l m not a gentleman 
do you think we should get back to claire 
yeah  many more lorenzos 
okay 
we should get back to claire 
i am lorenzo bartolini 
take him  take him 
i am lorenzo bartolini 
wow 
i am lorenzo bartolini 
do you know what you are 
you are the montagues and the capulets 
you mean    well  at least l m not romeo 
  that s the understatement of the century 
  no  no  no  because you see 
if i found the love of my life 
i wouldn t stand there like an idiot
whispering in a garden 
i would just grab her from that
blasted balcony and be done with it 
do you believe in destiny 
do you 
yeah  i think so 
i think it s destiny that l m here  right now 
with claire 
of course  of course  with claire 
well  this is the street 
well  there s 2  here s number 2 
this is what i feared the most 
  charlie  we don t even know if it s him 
  i hope it s not  i hope it s not 
  either way  we re finished  we re done 
  no  not here 
when do we stop 
over the next hill  or the next 
scour the whole country 
no  no  it ends here 
there are other lorenzos
not too far away from here 
it s not the ending you want  is it 
this isn t just a clever story
  with a clever ending 
  stop it  charlie 
  it s our life  it s my gran s life 
  it s not about   
charlie  it s not about a story 
no  no  no  she s already lost the man once 
how many more times
would you have her lose him 
you know what 
i don t expect you to understand any of this
because you don t know a thing
about real loss 
yeah 
you re wrong 
sophie s mother ran away from her
when she was a little girl 
it s different  gran  it s different 
you re right 
but
sophie s mother chose to leave her 
and you always knew your mum and dad
loved you 
come in 
hi 
oh  dear 
i just wanted to see if you were all right 
l m okay 
claire  l m so sorry if i caused you   
no 
every minute has been so special 
darling 
may i 
one of the great joys in life
is having one s hair brushed 
charlie  say you re sorry 
in the eye  charlie  with contrition 
sophie   
  thank you 
   l m afraid i   
in the eye 
yes  gran  l m not 12 
prove it 
l m sincerely sorry  sophie 
it won t happen again 
excellent

wherever they may be 
may i join you 
please 
i am sorry  sophie 
i used to lay out under the stars as a kid 
in the summertime

 doubt that the sun doth move 
 doubt truth be a liar
 but never doubt i love

no  you know 
you can t go on forever 
at some point  you have to stop 
then why is it that

boy 
  we re here 
  it s amazing 
i just want to say thank you
on behalf of myself and my lovely wife 
la mia bella claire 
and now it s your turn 
  well   
  go on 
dear friends 
50 years ago 
i went to juliet s house in verona 
i wrote her a letter
and i asked her a question 
and two months ago  i received a reply 
and without that letter 
none of us would be here today 
sophie  would you mind
if i read out the words you wrote to me 
all right 
 dear claire   what  and  if 
 are two words as non threatening
as words can be 
 but put them together  side by side 
 and they have the power
to haunt you for the rest of your life 
 what if 
 i don t know how your story ended 
 but if what you felt then was true love
 then it s never too late 
 if it was true then 
why wouldn t it be true now 
 you need only the courage
 to follow your heart 
 i don t know
what a love like juliet s feels like 
 a love to leave loved ones for 
a love to cross oceans for 
 but l d like to believe 
if i ever were to feel it 
 that l d have the courage to seize it 
 and  claire  if you didn t 
 i hope one day that you will 
 all my love 
 juliet 
i ll be right back  all right  gran 
sophie 
of course 
  a balcony 
  well 
what are you doing up there 
l m gonna go 
why 
because this is really painful 
i should have realized sooner  but i didn t 
or i guess maybe i couldn t 
but victor and i aren t together anymore 
  and i guess i came back hoping that   
  wait  wait  you re not engaged 
no 
but it s too late 
it s clearly too late 
and it really doesn t matter anymore
because  honestly 
i love you 
i can t believe i just said that 
but i do  i love you  it doesn t   
i mean  it shouldn t matter to you 
  because you re here with patricia 
  patricia 
and you should be back with her right now 
patricia is my cousin  she s my cousin 
  how is that legal 
  no   
sophie    no 
no  no  no  let me explain 
sophie  l m so stupid  there s two patricias 
there s my cousin  who s here 
and the one
that l ve completely forgotten about 
more importantly  there s only one sophie 
now  would you please come down 
wait  charlie  charlie  stop 
what are you doing 
charlie  what are you doing 
listen to me 
listen to me very  very carefully 
i live in london  a gorgeous  vibrant 
historic city that i happen to love living in 
you live in new york 
which is highly overrated 
  pardon me 
but since the atlantic ocean
is a bit wide to cross every day 
swimming  boating or flying 
i suggest we flip for it 
what are you saying 
and if those terms are unacceptable 
leaving london will be a pleasure 
as long as you re waiting for me
on the other side 
 cause the truth is  sophie 
i am madly  deeply  truly 
passionately in love with you 
you are 
i am 
  are you gonna kiss me 
  yeah 
yeah 
oh  my god 
charlie 
i can t believe i just did that 
hi 
are you okay 
please tell me no one saw that 
nobody saw it 
good  that s good 
can you move 
only my lips 
what if we were made for each other
born to become best friends and lovers
i want to stay right here
in this moment with you
over and over and over again
what if this could be a real love
a love  a love  yeah
i don t know what to think
is this real or just a dream 
in my heart is where you ll be
i ll keep waiting till we meet
what if we were made for each other
born to become best friends and lovers
i want to stay right here
in this moment with you
over and over and over again
what if this could be a real love
a love  a love  yeah
i write our names down in the sand
picturing all our plans
i close my eyes and i can see
you  and you ask   will you marry me  
is it made up in my mind 
am i crazy just wasting time 
i think this could be love
l m serious
what if we were made for each other
born to become best friends and lovers
i want to stay right here
in this moment with you
over and over and over again
what if this could be a real love 
a love  a love  yeah
boy  you know you really make my heart stop
stop  stop
