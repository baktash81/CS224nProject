a career ahead in surveillance 
l hear patroltec has an opening 
so   
exactly what
did you girls do last night 
exactly 
exactly 
here s the thing  mom 
the thing is   
we left the house 
but l assure you  it was for
a very important adolescent cause 
adolescent 
as in   growing up   
ls that so hard to believe 
yes  it is 
because not too long ago
l had a little girl who took ballet 
she did magic tricks 
we used to bake together
in her easy bake oven 
and she loved ponies and ladybugs 
l remember her 
l guess l missed the bridge
between ladybugs and boys 
l think l m still standing on that bridge 
you take your time crossing it 
got you something 
a doorknob 
with a lock 
to the urstoppable freshmer 
unstoppable 
  that s my mom 
  she s giving me a ride 
l have to get home
and finish packing 
  bye 
  bye 
bye 
  l had a fun time

you re really moving 
everything changes now 
everything would have changed anyway 
last night did that 
tell me how the view is
from the lunch spot 
lf we sit there 
what do you mean 
wherever we sit 
that ll be the lunch spot 
you re ready for high school 
l blame you 
take care of the girls 
don t forget 
never 
l think this is yours 
ard so it happered  
the girl ir the lopsided crowr
got her kiss 
naturally  h told harrah all about it 
h try to keep her up to date
