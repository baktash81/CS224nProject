all the people that i used to know  see 
do i remember louise bryant 
why  of course 
i couldn t forget her if i tried 
i can t   
i might sort of scratch my memory 
but not at the moment 
you know  things go
and come back again 
it was christopher street 
and i was thinking about
another street down there instead 
until it came back
that it was christopher street 
sometimes i have lapses like that 
i d forgotten all about them 
were they socialists 
i guess they must ve been 
but i don t think they were
of any importance 
i don t remember them at all 
i know that jack went around
with mabel dodge 
and then he went around
with another gal 
and then he went around
with louise bryant 
i know there were shifts back and forth 
but it never occurred to me   
it never impinged on
my own personal life 
i like baseball 
i don t know what
the outside world thought of them 
but they were a couple 
i mean  you always spoke of
louise bryant and jack reed 
i recall his telling me
that he had two ambitions
when he came to college 
one was to be elected
president of his class 
he didn t know anyone in the class 
no one knew him 
the other was to make a million dollars
by the time he was 25 
now  my idea about jack reed
is probably different from most 
but i knew him well 
i knew he was a man of strong views 
i knew he was independent 
and i have an idea 
i may be wrong of this 
that his wife was a communist
and that his wife had influenced him 
as any wife does 
as you know and i know 
louise bryant 
well  i thought she was something
of an exhibitionist 
no  i m not gonna talk about people 
don t fool yourself 
no  sir  i m not    i m not
a purveyor of neighborhood gossip 
or anything of the kind 
that s not my job 
he was quiet 
he was a nice fellow 
i would say  if i met him 
i would say he was a nice fellow 
he was  however  a fighting fellow
in regards to principles 
i said  i think 
that a guy who s always interested
in the condition of the world
and changing it
either has no problems of his own
or refuses to face them 
jack   
well  i wouldn t call him a playboy 
but some people did 
jack reed s life  short as it was 
happened at a time 
and all of us  after all 
are the victims of our time and place 
when he had the opportunity 
as a reporter 
to be in some very exciting
and dramatic places 
it isn t everybody can
be buried in the kremlin 
and he s the only american 
born in portland  oregon 
now  isn t that something 
  what s he hugging 
  a statue 
well  i can see that 
but what s it a statue of 
it s just a statue  mr  woodward 
  how much is it 
  it s  75 
  for a photograph 
  that s right  mrs  rudisile 
this is interesting  mrs  trullinger 
not that it isn t very nice 
but it isn t a painting 
mr  woodward 
i d like you to look at this 
  i think i see the intention here 
  yes 
eve dominates  you see 
the dream dominates the dreamer 
it s   
it looks blurry to me 
the other one looked blurry  too 
i think that s the intention
of the photographer  mr  woodward 
what  to be blurry 
but perhaps if you looked at it
from a different point of view   
louise 
this is you 
lovely figure 
louise  have you taken
leave of your senses 
don t be a fool  paul 
you think i m a fool
because i object to my wife
being displayed naked in front
of half the people i know   
yes  my god 
it s a work of art in a gallery 
what s the matter with you 
you used to call portland
a stuffy provincial coffin for the mind 
it may be stuffy and provincial 
but it also happens
to be a coffin where i earn a living 
you can take your living
and fill up teeth with it 
because i can earn my own living 
i have my work 
you consider a few articles in
the oregonian and the gazette work 
no  i ll tell you
what your work is  louise 
it s making yourself
the center of attention 
it s shocking louise trullinger 
emancipated woman of portland 
now  we re gonna say good night
to these people and go home 
  i m going to the liberal club 
  you re not going to the liberal club 
  i m going to the liberal club  paul 
  no  you re not   
it s very nice  mrs  trullinger  all of it 
it s very gratifying to hear 
isn t it  louise 
isn t it  louise 
of course  you know
who is going to be at the liberal club 
patriotic americans believe in freedom 
and unless we are willing to take arms
to defend our heritage 
we cannot call ourselves
patriotic americans 
i m proud to be free 
i m proud to be an american 
and if the man
we elected president decides
that our freedoms are being threatened
and that the world must
be made safe for democracy 
then i know i won t be alone
in heeding the call of patriotism 
what is this war about 
each man will have his own answer 
i have mine  i m ready to be called 
now  tonight we have with us
the son of margaret
and the late c j  reed of portland 
who has witnessed this war first hand 
and i  for one  see no reason
why we here at the liberal club
shouldn t listen to what
jack reed has to say 
what would you say
this war is about  jack reed 
profits 
what did he say 
excuse me  mr  reed 
hello  my name is louise bryant
and i am a journalist 
and i was wondering if you might
have time to give me an interview 
i m sorry  i don t  i don t do interviews 
i had a piece in the blast not long ago 
  berkman s blast  really 
  that s right 
well  when did you want
to do this interview 
now 
i don t live here 
  i live in a house by the river 
  oh  really 
my  my  my  two places 
yeah  i use this place as a studio 
do you like white lilies 
they re my favorite flowers 
  you re not married  are you 
  no  i don t think i believe in marriage 
  are you married 
  marriage 
how could anyone believe in marriage 
i bet your mother s glad
to see you back in portland 
just glad when i m not in jail 
is this you 
yes  do you like it 
yeah  i think they re   
  a little blurry  but this one s very nice 
  yes 
it is  now   
granted  the profit motive
in the world economy
is a basic root cause for the war 
do you feel that those
americans who are pro war
and who ascribe their motives
to patriotism are cynical or naive 
and  if they re cynical 
is it the cynicism of patriots
who feel that without a profit motive 
the power structure elite of this country
will not enter the war 
even though they feel
that the containment
of german militarism
may be necessary for   
all right  miss bryant  do you want
an interview  write this down 
are you naive enough to think
containing german militarism
has anything to do with this war 
don t you understand that england
and france own the world economy
and germany just wants a piece of it 
keep writing  miss bryant 
miss bryant  can t you grasp
that j p  morgan
has loaned england and france
a billion dollars 
and if germany wins 
he won t get it back 
more coffee 
america would be entering the war
to protect j p  morgan s money 
if he loses it  we ll have a depression 
so  the real question is 
why do we have an economy
where the poor have to pay
so the rich won t lose money 
all right  now  what haven t we covered 
economic freedom for women
means sexual freedom 
and sexual freedom
means birth control   
dissent  the masses stands for dissent 
   we have a predominantly
upper middle class readership 
so  we have to run around the country
raising money for the magazine
any way we   
what 
well  i m thinking that i guess i   
that i ought to offer you more coffee 
i hadn t realized the hour  but
i seem to have taken up
a lot of your time 
well  that s okay by me 
does this happen to you often 
not often enough 
well 
we certainly have come a long way fast 
yeah 
do you want to take it a step further 
yeah 
what would you think if i asked you
to do something
that might seem a little selfish 
well  i    i think you should 
good  good  because i d like you
to take a look at my work
and tell me what you think 
you see  i really respect
your opinion so much 
well  it s odd 
because i was just gonna ask you
if you had anything
i could take a look at 
i know it s an imposition
but i d be very grateful and you see 
i ve read everything
that you ve ever written 
well  i d be happy to do it  so  that s   
well  thank you 
well  then i    i ll get your coat 
oh  and i hope you won t
be gentle with me 
  gentle 
  i m a serious writer 
you can really be tough 
no  i will be  no  i will be 
  thank you 
  thank you 
  do you want me to leave 
  not really  but i m late 
  late at 6 00 in the morning 
  yes  i have an appointment 
well  could i see you tomorrow night 
i m busy tomorrow night 
  because i m leaving town the next day 
  gee  i m sorry 
so  if you have time 
let me know what you think 
and i ll send you a copy of the interview

take a look sometime 
yeah  yeah  yeah  okay  i understand

you want me

yeah 
what as  what as 
  what do you mean  what   
  what as 
  your girlfriend 
  what does that mean 
what as  your girlfriend 
your mistress  your paramour 
your concubine 
why does it have to be as anything 
because i don t wanna
get into some kind
of emotional possessive involvement
where i m not able to   
i want to know what as 
well  it s nearly thanksgiving 
why don t you come as a turkey 
i always thought she was
a very earnest girl who went away 
probably the dentist knew nothing
except about teeth 
and was mainly interested   
and then she had
this wonderful journalist
who could talk about all sorts of things 
i had a coat i brought from germany 
and she wanted that coat
and made me all kinds of propositions 
but i wanted it  too 
but finally i gave in and gave it to her 
i had other coats 
so that s how she operated 
she went after him 
as i say  she got him 
so she wasn t any dummy 
but it was something to happen
in little old portland 
you didn t hear the word  sex  
you didn t hear the word  lesbian  
you didn t hear the word  homosexual  
you didn t hear the word  abortion  
you didn t hear those things 
men respected women 
they helped them on with their coats 
they opened the doors for them 
and the man and woman
who courted each other 
they married each other 
you know something that i think 
that there was just as much
fucking going on then as now 
only now 
it has a more perverted quality 
now there s no love whatever included 
then  there was your heart 
a bit of heart in it 
greenwich village was there 
and new york was around it 
and the rest of new york did not act
the way greenwich village did  exactly 
it was sort of a center of dissent
and had been for a long time
in american life 
people from all over
the country came there 
they were regarded as bohemian 
their ways of life were irregular 
the way they dressed
and certainly the way they thought
was outside the mainstream
of american life 
and as i recollect it 
marriage was not important
in greenwich village 
i remember hearing a line
jack said to somebody
he was trying to lure into bed 
she was being very coy  and he said 
 aren t you pagan enough  
hello 
hello  jack 
if it s illegal to hand out pamphlets
on birth control 
i m proud to be a criminal 
no one is arguing with your
inalienable right to go to jail  emma 
all i m saying
is that this is not the right time
to go to jail for birth control 
oh  there s a right time
to go to jail for birth control 
the masses is governing
conscience now 
soon you ll be indistinguishable
from the new york times 
emma  all i m saying
is that you are too valuable
  to the anti war movement 
  you re wrong 
  no  he s right  if we get into this war   
  and you re wrong 
  will you let me finish my sentence 
  your sentence is not worth finishing 
thousands of american women 
overworked  underfed 
are dying  giving birth to anemic
children who can t last out a year 
are their lives any less valuable
than thousands of american boys  
  i want those back tuesday 
  i m not saying    do you think 
  oh  shit 
  exactly 
good night 
  you want some coffee 
  chase and sanborn 
  i m out of coffee 
  again  i m leaving 
no  the conversation is over 
you re a journalist  jack 
when you re a revolutionary 
we ll discuss priorities 
hopefully over coffee 
  it s late  i ll walk you home 
  why  i won t hurt anybody 
well   
yeah 
it s friday night 
i m so glad to see you 
really  i m so glad to see you 
i finished your articles 
they re very good 
the railroad piece  i think  is   
needs polishing 
  it s repetitious  but   
  but that s deliberate 
i m using repetition to make a point 
i don t want it to seem too polished 
oh 
well  i think
you re gonna love new york 
emma  emma  emma 
i think it was emma goldberg 
i think so 
i never forgot emma goldman 
she inspired me to the very depths 
and max eastman was a beloved man 
the real radical  a free spirit 
he was in that same group
with that emma goldman 
that was her name 
goldman  not goldberg 
floyd dell was one of them 
he wrote novels  beautiful novels 
the radicals included people
like the iwws
and bill haywood 
and there were walter lippmann 
and lincoln steffens
and isadora duncan
and edna st  vincent millay 
alfred stieglitz   
oh  and margaret sanger 
my lord  i picketed for her 
and  of course 
the great writer eugene o neill
came from down there 
i don t think there s anybody
who can touch o neill today 
you have to be a bit of a rebel
to be an artist of any kind  i believe 
and everybody in greenwich village
was a bit of a rebel 
  what do you do  louise 
  i write 
good for you 
could you pass the bread  please 
  thanks 
  because to the middle class american 
everyone on the left is the same 
an anarchist  a socialist   
would you pass the bread  please 
  what do you do  louise 
  i write 
good  madame schumann heink   
jack tells me you write  miss bryant 
what do you write about 
everything 
you write about everything 
everything  yes  everything  nothing   
just   
i see 
now  about davis and sloan 
have they quit 
not yet  but they   
i don t think they should sit here
like this  i don t  i think it s cruel 
  it s just   
  organization  right 
look  what does a capitalist do 
let me ask you that  mike 
huh  tell me 
i mean  what does he make 
besides money 
i don t know what he makes 
the workers do all the work  don t they 
well  what if they got organized 
i mean  all the workers 
not just the plumbers 
and the carpenters
and the goddamn cigar makers 
but all of them  all over the world 
not in just one country 
give him a beer  will you 
what if they all got organized 
don t you think they could   
they could change society overnight 
they can make it into
anything they wanted 
jack  can i tap you for  5  i m flat 
well  don t ask this pretentious
son of a bitch for money 
if you need  5  i ll give it to you 
let me have  4 50  will you 
  what isn t fair 
  you see what i m saying 
if all the workers in the world
belonged to one big union 
  there wouldn t be a war  would there 
  are you listening to me 
miss bryant 
you ve been nursing
that beer for an hour 
can i get you a glass of wine
or something 
no  thank you  i m fine 
thank you  anyway 
  beer s fine 
  you are an amiable person 
and a very good painter  i hear 
i write

read engels  read marx 
my god  you can t interpret freud
in an economic context 
you know you got a taxi waiting 
zosima represents
the corruption of religion 
i tell you you re wrong

  but do you seriously believe

see you tomorrow 
we ve been trying for two years 
capitalists can take this country into
war any time they damn well please 
the only impact you can make
is in the streets 
of course  but   
but don t you think  emma 
that if debs gets a lot of votes 
it ll strengthen that image 
no  i don t  i think voting is the opium
of the masses in this country 
every four years  you deaden the pain 
yeah  but   
don t you think   
i just made it very clear
what i think  miss bryant 
come on  e g 
don t be so goddamn dogmatic 
  louise has a point  she says   
  suddenly i m dogmatic 
why does my status change
every time you get a new woman  jack

  you see whigham 
  yesterday 
  how was that 
  we mostly talked about you  of course 
did he offer you work 
no  but he made a big point
of telling me
what wonderful friends
you and he have become over the years 
it was a fascinating meeting 
are you angry at whigham or me 
what is it 
it s nothing 
you said you d be back tuesday
and it s saturday 
didn t i say i d back
at the end of the week 
  the end of the week is friday 
  the end of the week is friday 
saturday s not the
end of the week anymore  huh 
jack  you said you d be back tuesday 
what difference does it make 
what do you think i ve been doing 
running around listening
to the sound of my own voice 
how do i know whose voice
you ve been listening to 
obviously you like it
a lot better than mine 
look at me  oh  god 
i m like a wife 
i m like a boring  clinging 
miserable little wife 
  who d wanna come home to me 
  me 
well  i can t do this 
i can t do this anymore 
you can t do what 
i m just living in your margins 
i don t know what i m doing here 
i don t know what my purpose is 
  well  tell me what you want 
  i want to stop needing you 
i want you to know something 
i asked whigham
if he d send me to france 
  is that what you want 
  that s what i want 
  what are you doing  louise 
  i can t work around you 
will you tell me why you re doing this 
i m not taken seriously
when you re around 
when i m around
you re not taken seriously 
oh  god  this is not good 
you mean
you think i m taken more seriously 
is that what you re talking about 
do you mean you re not 
come on  jack 
you know what i m saying 
you re not being honest with me 
i don t know what you re saying 
you re not being honest with me 
please  be honest with me 
i am so being honest with you 
maybe if you took yourself a little more
seriously  other people would  too 
i told you what i thought
about the armory piece 
i was honest about that 
i think it s very nice 
but no  i don t take it very seriously 
  thank you 
  why do you even expect
to be taken seriously if you re
not writing about serious things 
i don t understand that 
i found myself an apartment 
i m looking for one 
i m not even sure i know
what things you re serious about 
one day you re writing
about the railroads 
and you don t even finish the piece 
the next day you re doing a piece
on an art exhibition
that happened three years ago 
look  why do you give me
anything to read  anyway 
if i criticize it at all 
you tell me you like it the way it is 
and when we re out with other people 
if somebody doesn t ask you
a direct question 
you tell me you feel ignored 
but with everything
that s happening in the world today 
you decide to sit down and write a piece
on the influence of the goddamned
armory show of 1913 
are people supposed
to take that seriously 
well  i don t really care 
  you care 
  i m not really    i don t care 
  you care 
  i don t care 
and i m not interested
in whether your stupid friends
  take me seriously or not 
  well  they don t take it seriously 
that s why they don t take it seriously 
i found an apartment on houston street 
and i m moving in 
and i ll tell you something else 
jack reed 
i don t think we like the same people
or the same kind of life 
  and i wanna be on my own 
  go ahead  be on your own 
i don t give a damn 
you re on your own anyway 
oh  i know you don t give a damn 
well  will you tell me
why the hell i should give a damn 
you shouldn t  don t give a damn 
  i don t give a damn  either 
  that s right  i don t give a damn 
  i m getting out of here 
  good  fine  i m leaving  too 
honey  can we just
get out of new york 
let s go somewhere
and just write what we wanna write 
provincetown was
just a tiny little fishing village 
and it was very  very conservative 
we d take the fall river steamer
up there  i remember  every summer 
we used to save fares
by sleeping in tiers 
and we always got bedbugs 
you did whatever you pleased up there 
and we put on some very
interesting plays  experimental plays
that a commercial theater
couldn t possibly do 
take susan glaspell s trifles 
there s a whole play
without the protagonist
even appearing on the stage 
and they gave three one act plays 
one of them was a play by   
i always thought it was by john reed
and louise bryant 
but i see it s by her 
they were in it 
the play was terrible 
and they were worse 
and of course  gene o neill
was known as the poet 
but i liked his plays
better than his poetry 
will you never understand 
are you so stupid
that you do not know what i mean 
i am offering myself to you 
i am kneeling before you 
i have promised you my body 
my body that men have
found so beautiful 
i have promised to love you 
a negro sailor 
tell them not to stand behind the moon 
don t stand behind the moon 
  back 
  can you step back a little bit 
 cause of the moon 
this is the moon here 
  this way 
  yes 
take it from  i hate the sea  
will you never understand 
are you so stupid
that you don t know what i mean 
i m offering myself to you 
i m kneeling before you 
i    i  who have had so many men
kneel before me 
i m offering you my body 
my body that men have
found so beautiful 
i have promised to love you 
you  a negro sailor 
is that not humiliation enough
that you must keep me waiting so 
answer me  please  answer me 
will you give me that water 
i have no water 
old teddy wants this war  doesn t he 
i wonder how long it ll take the public
to find out he s a maniac 
teddy roosevelt has rabies 
universal military training 
jack  your second speech is out 
and the ironic part of it is
that poor people  they love him 
sure  they do 
they ll take him up san juan hill again 
you can t touch the bunny suit 
it s rented 
did you read the piece
on the convention 
if the left doesn t defend wilson 
we re gonna get president hughes 
think we ought to go to st  louis 
i am not going to st  louis
to defend wilson 
  i think we should 
  why  what good would it do 
i don t know 
if you don t think hughes would have us
in a war in a few months 
it wouldn t do any good at all 
wilson s kept us out so far 
reed thought that he was a good poet 
he was a terrible poet 
he thought that he could write
good novels 
short stories 
of course  he was a poet 
and not a great poet 
but some of it was very fine 
but  as a journalist 
jack reed topped them all 
  look  pull this up 
  hey  jack 
see  that s good 
jack  your ride s here 
  excuse me  i ll wait outside 
  okay  okay 
  do you see what i mean  if one   
  jack  the taxi s waiting 
yeah  i got to run 
bye  honey 
jack reed wanted to stir up trouble 
he wanted to stir up trouble
for the capitalists 
and he also wanted
to arouse the working masses
to the necessity of some
kind of effective united action 
in other words  i am accusing him
of either being a busybody
or of being a fraidy cat 
not wanting to face things
of his own nature 
dear louise  st  louis is very hot
and very crowded with democrats 
all having a wonderful time
and wearing little paper hats
in anticipation of wilson s nomination 
i d like to think it s because
he doesn t want the united states
to go into the war 
but who knows
the mind of a democrat 
by the way  i ve decided to throw out
the poem on white lilies 
the rhyming scheme was wrong 
maybe when i get back
i can start it again 
politics sure plays hell
with your poetry 
i keep thinking i see you 
it s the damnedest thing 
i miss you  honey 
i miss walking on the beach 
  hello 
  where s the whiskey 
would you like a glass 
don t try and decide 
i ll get you one 
i like your play 
i only hope i can do the part justice 
i think your dialogue is beautiful 
i really do  i love it   
then why the hell
don t you just stand still and say it
instead of wandering all over the stage 
you re supposed to be looking
for your soul  not an ashtray 
would you rather i didn t smoke
during rehearsals 
i d rather you went up in flames
than put out your cigarette
in the middle
of a monologue about birth 
i m sorry  you re absolutely right 
it makes me wanna cancel
the whole production 
i won t do it again 
excuse me  i m sorry 
you keep the glass  i ll take the bottle 
are you leaving 
give me your glass 
are you nervous 
  or is that a tremor 
  why aren t you in chicago with jack 
why should i be 
he has his things  i have mine 
  what are they 
  what 
the things that you have that are yours 
what are they 
my work  for one 
he s a real mean
son of a bitch  isn t he 
what do you mean 
leaving you alone with your work 
  you think i mind 
  you should 
it s the one thing
we mustn t be left alone with 
  you may feel that way  i don t 
  good 
don t let those village radicals keep you
from being what you should be 
what do you think i should be 
the center of attention 
well  you must have been
with some very competitive women 
let s just say possessive 
possessive  that s something else 
it s a waste of time 
i m not 
neither is jack  for that matter 
oh  yes  i know 
you and jack have your own things 
he has the freedom to do the things
that he wants to and so do i 
and i think anyone who s afraid
of that kind of freedom
is really only afraid
of his own emptiness 
are you making this up
as you go along 
i d like you to go 
why 
because i don t want to be patronized 
i m sorry if you don t believe
in mutual independence
and free love and respect 
don t give me a lot of parlor socialism
that you learned in the village 
if you were mine  i wouldn t share you
with anybody or anything 
it d be just you and me 
you d be at the center of it all 
you know 
it would feel lot more like love
than being left alone with your work 
  i hope i haven t upset you 
  not at all  i m grateful 
but you seem to be looking
for something much more serious
than what i had in mind 
  than what you had in mind 
  yes 
you see  jack and i
are both perfectly capable
of living with our beliefs 
but i think someone as romantic as you
would be destroyed by them 
and i don t want that to happen 
it would upset jack too much 
you can t come and play in my yard
i don t love you anymore
you ll be sorry when you see me
sliding down my cellar door
you can t holler down my rain barrel
you can t climb my apple tree
i don t want to play in your yard
if you can t be good to me
i don t want to play in your yard
i don t like you anymore
you ll be sorry when you see me
sliding down our cellar door
you can t holler down our rain barrel
you can t climb our apple tree
i don t want to play in your yard
if you won t be good to me
wonderful 
floyd  i ve been
waiting for this for weeks 
tap your sensuality 
  wonderful close 
  extraordinary 
very good  excellent 
  floyd  that s new for you  isn t it 
  max  what about you 
  okay  who s next 
  i just recited
two thirds of my new play 
you said it was a work
of uncanny perception 
oh  did i  how quickly we forget 
  well 
  jack  come in 
news from the front 
  hello  jack 
  hello  jack 
  hi  jack 
  how was the trip 
welcome back 
  who s next 
  nobody s next 
let s have a dance out of gene 
jack  you re just in time
to see o neill dance 
okay  do something irish 
come on  gene 
yeah  let s have it  gene 
  yeah  go ahead gene 
  recite something from your new play 
hutch says it s wonderful 
tell us about the convention  jack 
how was wilson s speech 
never mind the speech 
what was he wearing 
  what about wilson 
  yeah  what about wilson 
oh  i don t think there s any reason to
believe that wilson s gonna do anything
other than support the interest of the
ruling class and take us into the war 
but as long as he says he s against it 
then i think we have to support him 
because he ll have to make good on
that campaign promise
for at least a few months
and that might give us time
to strengthen the anti war coalition 
but there s a lot more pro war feeling in
the streets now than there was before   
you want another drink  gene 
i guess not 
  good night 
  night 
good night 
would you like
some cold tea with lemon 
no  thanks 
well  i ll have some  anyway

two  no  there should be three 
oh  excuse me  i m sorry 
i m very sorry to hover like this 
it s not that
you re not doing a wonderful job 
it s just that i m very concerned
about this one particular box 
  here  no  no 
  i ll take it 
where s the whiskey 
  lady  where do you want this 
  oh  just put it over there 
that ll be fine  thank you 
yeah 
  anything to drink in there

oh  here  thanks 
thank you very much  i   
  thank you  good

you know 
you left without saying goodbye 
that s not like you  not that i have
slightest idea what you re like 
success at last  see  a    here we go 
your skill as a bartender
seems to have deteriorated 
  are you nervous 
  yes  no  i m   
why should i be nervous  my god 
it s gonna smell like a saloon in here 
  what is it 
  it s a poem telling you that i love you 
and that i won t be possessive
and i won t be jealous 
and you can sleep with whoever
you want  live with whoever you want 
i ll do anything that you say 
i d like to kill you  but i can t 
so you can do whatever you want to 
except not see me 
or smoke during the monologue 
gene  jack and i 
we haven t told anyone yet
because we were too embarrassed 
but
we re married 
jack and i got married 
  that is embarrassing 
  yes  isn t it 
we felt very silly  but we wanted to do it 
and it s gonna be good 
we re gonna work together 
we re gonna spend
all our time together 
that s why we took a lease
on this place 
so we wouldn t have to go back
to the city 
does this mean that we have to cheat 
or is this a free
and independent marriage 
  gene 
  you re a lying irish whore from portland
and you used me
to get jack reed to marry you 
no  i didn t 
i just want us to be friends  gene 
oh  how genteel  that would be a
good role for you  wouldn t it 
 there s louise with jack and gene 
 he s crazy about her 
but jack doesn t know 
 poor jack  poor gene 
what a heartbreaker she is  
what a heartbreaker you are  louise 
i m sorry  i m   
where is he 
washington 
well  mrs  reed 
i ll do whatever you say 
what do you want me to do 
wish us well 
i wish you well 
you and jack 
jack 
oh  god 
i m not sure whether she had an affair
with eugene o neill or not
during this time 
and nobody seemed to know  or   
it was nobody s business  anyway  so   
i don t know what that situation was 
the report was that
she and reed and o neill
had a ménage à trois 
jack  what    what is   
oh  god  i swear   
   that we love america 
we love her mountains  her forests   
there were mutinies
in the french army 
there were mutinies
in various parts of the front 
and then  in 1917  the troops 
poorly armed 
poorly equipped  poorly clothed 
went back to russia
to talk it out with the czar 
and when they got through 
there wasn t any czar 
revolution in russia 
this was the spring of 1917 
and i became so excited
that i zigzag jumped the benches
as we walked out of the park 
oh  i was so happy as a young boy 
revolution  the people take over 
down with the czar 
naturally  i was happy 
well  haven t you made the politics
a little nebulous here 
  what do you mean  nebulous  
  unclear   
  how can you say they re unclear 
  well  they re unclear to me  i   
why am i necessarily attempting
to define the politics
of a specific group of people 
it isn t what i said 
i think it s a vast oversimplification 
oh  it s just an opinion 
you know 
if you made carbons of these 
i could take them on the train with me 
wilson  of course 
was elected on the platform of
 keep us out of war  in 1916 
but in 1917  wilson reversed himself
and declared war against germany 
the mission at that time was to make
the world safe for democracy 
reed said 
 this is a war for democracy 
where is the goddamn democracy  
if men really disapproved of war  dear 
we d have stopped wars years ago 
men like wars  always have 
so they all went and got little uniforms 
went to war 
  my country is at war 
  yes 
and so today  i  too  am at war 
my name is jack reed 
i m from new york 
this is not my war  and i m not gonna
have anything to do with it 
all right  all right 
all right  folks 
there was a lot of anti war feeling 
of course 
we had no one against the war 
there wasn t a soul against the war 
well  i m not talking about saying it
to the workers any other way 
how do we move them 
right  how do we organize them 
the socialist party   
the socialist party of america
is nothing to sneeze at 
you think the socialist party
is going to take a position 
you boys are reds  aren t you 
the socialist party is useless 
jack  is that right 
now  that s the truth  jack 
the united states is at war 
your friends are talking to you 
if the workers of the world act together 
they can stop the war  and i m not   
this one even pisses red 
you ran around saving the world
until your kidney acted up again 
very intelligent 
and you re gonna keep running around
making speeches
until you wind up
in the hospital  brilliant 
and then 
you re gonna lose your kidney  perfect 
harry  how much is the government
paying you to keep me quiet 
  very funny  keep laughing 
  yeah 
that hurt  didn t it 
listen  i m gonna tell you something 
you re not gonna be able to keep doing
what you ve been doing 
this is a serious condition 
it could kill you 
harry  look  i want to know if   
could this thing interfere
with having children 
  yes  you cannot have sex if you die 
  no  come on  harry  seriously 
are you thinking about having children 
not at the moment 
but i want to be able to   
is louise talking about it 
no 
well  just because
she isn t talking about it
it doesn t mean
she isn t thinking about it 
don t worry  you don t make babies
with your kidneys 
look  i m gonna send you home
to louise 
tell her to keep you there 
put you in bed 
give you lots of liquids 
i m gonna write it all down 
look  louise doesn t know about
this  and i don t want her to  okay 
  fine 
  so  can you give me my bill here 
  i don t want it sent to the house 
  do you have any money 
not at the moment 
then why the hell
should i give you a bill  go home 
it is my belief that socialism and peace
are inseparable 
and i reiterate that the socialist party
will stand firmly behind
its resolution to oppose
american involvement in this war 
mr  chairman  louis fraina 
local boston 
the chair recognizes
the delegate from boston 
and i still want to know
what specific action
we are going to take against the war 
your resolution is all very nice 
but will it stop even one boy from
being killed  i don t think so 
   stigmatized as unpatriotic 
the task that confronts us is difficult 
let us hope
that we can handle it properly 
what s that supposed to mean 
stupid 
i d like to know if the socialist party
is gonna fight conscription or not 
  that s what i d like to know 
  will the delegate identify himself 
i am not a delegate  mr  chairman 
my name is john reed 
i write for the magazine the masses 
and i want to know if the socialist party
is gonna organize demonstrations   
i m sorry  mr  reed 
you have no credentials here 
now  this floor is reserved
for delegates  not journalists 
mr  chairman 
is the socialist party prepared
  to take a position on the draft or not 
  hey  shut up 
i m sorry  mr  reed 
you have no credentials 
let him speak  will you 
mr  reed 
you re getting into party politics  eh 
i m just trying to be a journalist 
mr  chairman   
so is trotsky 
let us see what happens in russia 
why don t you join the socialist party 
we need good people like you 
big things are happening in russia 
as appalling as it may seem
to see socialists supporting bloodshed 
i can understand the necessity
of supporting one s government
during times of war 
the task that confronts us is a giant 
in that 
we must continue our opposition 
  we have to give this dog a name 
  well  she has a name 
what s the matter with her name 
  i can t find anything in this house 
  i m not going to call a dog  dog  
i suppose if she were a baby 
you d wanna call her  person  
not really 
i think i might wanna call her  jack  
no  no  bad 
see  now this is why
i can t find anything 
you put things anywhere 
dog  dog 
she s still not housebroken 
you got to grab her
when she squats like that 
and then take her outside  that s right 
and then when she goes 
you ve got to give her a reward 
all right  now  stay  dog 
are we having garlic for dinner  honey 
no  no  no 
why  why  do you think
i m using too much garlic 
i thought i d put a little in the sauce 
garlic doesn t bother me 
  that s from gene 
  sorry  i didn t mean to read it 
i didn t realize what it was 
he gave it to me in october 
i haven t seen him since 
  you don t have to explain 
  i m not explaining 
  i m just telling you it s over 
  louise  look 
i don t expect you to tell me
everything you do 
what about if you tell me something 
just tell me the truth 
  jack  i haven t seen him 
  don t do that  louise 
don t tell me that gene gave you
a love poem six or seven months ago 
but you put it in a book
and you haven t seen him since 
i don t care
whether you ve seen him or not 
  i just care about dishonesty 
  oh  i see 
you don t care
that i had an affair with another man 
you just care about dishonesty 
look who s being dishonest 
you care  you care so much 
you won t even talk about it 
  you won t even mention   
  wanna talk  i ll talk about it 
you want to be honest about it 
if i didn t wanna be honest about it 
do you think i d be silly enough
to leave a poem he gave me
lying around in the house
in a book of walt whitman 
why not whitman 
i m sure gene would feel right at home
in that company 
oh  no  you don t care 
why the hell should i care that
you slept with somebody else 
do you think i haven t 
i don t think we have to report
to each other
every time we go to bed with somebody 
it doesn t mean anything 
it doesn t mean that i love you any less 
do you love me any less
 cause you went to bed with gene 
what difference does it make 
i just don t think we should lie about it 
that s all 
  who 
  what do you mean   who  
  who was it 
  who was what 
who was it 
what do you want  a list 
it doesn t mean anything 
louise 
louise 
  what are you doing 
  i m not sure 
  i wanna know where you re going 
  i don t want to talk about it 
  well  i wanna talk about it 
  you said it all  jack 
what  what did i say now
that we both haven t said 100 times 
please forward my mail
to john k  wheeler 
wheeler bell syndicate 
i ll have someone pick up
the rest of my things in the morning 
didn t we say that people had to give
each other freedom
  if they were gonna live together 
  we said a lot of things 
i thought
we weren t going to be possessive 
  i thought you loved me 
  who says i don t 
you love yourself  me  you fuck 
when you re not fucking other people 
that is 
freedom  you mean i should just be
like you and not give a damn  is that   
is that what fucking gene means 
you don t give a damn about us 
i m not packing my bag 
i wanna know where you re going 
  get out of my   
  where you going 
  get out of my   
  you re not going   
get away  get out of my way 
  how many were there 
  come on  louise 
you don t know the first thing about
what living together means 
go ahead  i know where you re going 
i thought you needed someone
to share your life with  but i was wrong 
as long as you get your two shots of
limelight every day 
you don t need a thing 
you go to hell  both of you 
it could possibly have been
a matter of prestige  you know 
to say that you had an affair
with louise bryant 
i haven t been spared
the legends about men that are
supposed to have had affairs with me 
because i was known by name 
affairs which never occurred at all 
it s very difficult to tell  you know 
do you know there is nothing
more bewildering
than when you get a letter
from a loony who says 
 that marvelous week
we spent in venice  
  yeah 
  and it happens about every two years 
  yes 
  it s most extraordinary 
one day  i was out walking
with my aunt in portland 
and she was quite something 
she was six feet tall 
and i said to her 
 what is all this ado about louise 
 what do you think of her  aunt belle  
she said 
 well  she had something
that just appeals  
that s my story 
  how you feeling 
  oh  better 
  here you are 
  oh  thanks  harry 
thanks 
well  we got it out just in time 
but since god only knows what
condition the one you ve got left is in 
you better treat it well 
that means  tell that goddamn eastman
you got to be in bed by midnight 
if you get an infection now  that s it 
absolutely no salt 
 dear jack 
i m relieved you re feeling so well again 
 i talked to a specialist here in paris 
 and he said you can lead
a perfectly normal life 
 i hope you re not neglecting
your writing 
 please don t spend your energy
 getting caught up in things
you can t afford  
 dear jack  i m enclosing a piece
i ve written
 on a volunteer ambulance driver
 from the new york city
police department 
 also  please don t keep asking me
if you can come over here 
 it just makes me think you have no    
 dear jack  yes 
wheeler s very happy with my work 
 life here is so hectic and exhilarating
that i don t have a minute    
 dear jack  don t worry  i m well 
 my only problem is keeping up with
wheeler s demands for more stories  
    serial newsletter under the heading 
 letters from france  
 please don t mention this to anyone 
 i promised wheeler i wouldn t
say anything to you  
 dear jack  i feel i ve really grown
through my work for wheeler 
 and there s no reason to worry about
my being here alone  
bolsheviks  sandy  the bolsheviks 
jesus christ 
if the bolsheviks get in  sandy 
you can just bend right over
and kiss your ass goodbye 
because they ll pull russia
right out of the war

pete  the bolsheviks are small potatoes 
russia isn t gonna get out of the war 
you want to walk down

what are you talking about 
jesus christ 
don t tell her that i told you  all right

that wheeler had to let her go
because she hadn t turned anything in
that he could use 
other than some story about a cop
that went over there to drive
a police department ambulance 
  he let her go 
  fired her 
  when did you hear that 
  a couple of weeks ago 
no  it was a month 
more than a month and a half ago 
oh  look  jack 
wheeler s a goddamn moron 
tell her she shouldn t feel ashamed
about being fired 
  i m gonna see you later  huh 
  jack  what s the matter 
hell  we ve all been fired 
i ve been fired 
hell  i ll drink to it 
imagine  65 million
go to war  right 
10 million die 
10 million become orphans 
20 million become maimed  crippled 
or wounded 
you had catastrophe in europe 
you had a holocaust in europe 
you had a desire for change 
who can stop them
when there was
such a revolutionary sentiment  huh 
who could stop them 
you know  i think i m gonna have to get
a new typewriter   
  what are you   
  what 
you look fine  are you all right now 
oh  god  yes 
nobody needs two kidneys 
the second one s just for show 
sorry  this isn t a very good time 
they re moving me
to another communications center 
so  i m just not going to be able to
talk to you right now  jack 
could we just go out here a second 
just for a second 
  look  i m on my way to russia 
  oh  really  have you enlisted 
very funny 
i know you re doing work here
that s good 
 cause i read the ambulance piece
and i thought that was good 
  thank you 
  and i know you re working on your book
and i know how important that is to you 
but you got to have enough sense
if you re trying to build up
your reputation as a journalist 
to be in the right place at the right time 
  i appreciate your advice 
  well  the place to be now is russia 
  thank you  i ll remember that 
  louise  it s chaos  they can t last 
they re in their third
provisional government in six months 
you know what that means  it means
there might be another revolution 
the workers are deserting the factories 
the army s deserting the battlefronts 
the exiles are all coming back 
the jews  the anarchists  the socialists 
all of them are going back 
only this time
it might be the real thing 
and if they have
a real workers  revolution in russia 
they d have one in germany 
and if they had one in germany 
  it could happen all over the world 
  got a match 
louise  that d be the end of the war 
you don t have to tell me
what s happening in russia 
  i read the papers 
  well  come with me 
as a colleague 
i m not talking about anything else 
come with me as a colleague 
you ought to be in petrograd 
oh  yeah  well  that s what you said
about new york 
  i was right about new york 
  no  i have work i m doing here 
and i happen to think my work is   
it is important  but it s not important as
what you could be doing in russia 
i wanna work together  as partners 
i don t want a partner  and if
i wanted to go to russia  i d go alone 
  i wouldn t need you to take me 
  louise 
russia is not the safest place
in the world for a woman to be alone 
you may be a hell of a journalist 
but that doesn t mean   
louise  we d better hurry along 
so  moving you out of here  huh 
yes  i ve been promised an interview
with general plumer 
well  i ve got to run along myself

jack  jack reed 
  joe  joe volski

  yes  yeah

great things are happening 
are you traveling by yourself 
  i think i am 
  well  then i ll switch 
we met in chicago 
boy  oh  boy  were you a speaker 
you don t remember me  eh 
well  it s not that 
  maybe i just    maybe it s the hat 
  my hat 
yeah  maybe i just don t recognize you
in this particular hat 
oh  then i m a revolutionary
returning in disguise 
well  comes the revolution 
i ll buy you a new hat 
  i see you re studying russian 
  yeah  i m trying to 
know what 
  what 
  i mean 
ask me anything you want in russian 
thank you  i ll keep that in mind 
let s see   
excuse me 
excuse me  now here s the thing 
i d be a goddamned fool not to take you
up on this offer  so  here s what i want 
i want to sign my own name
to my own stories
and i don t want to use a double byline 
i want to be responsible
for my own time and my own actions 
i want to be referred to as miss bryant 
and not as mrs  reed 
and i want to keep an account
of every cent we spend
so that i can pay you back 
now  i assume you know that
i m not going to sleep with you 
so just don t confuse the issue
by bringing it up 
that s it 
  fine 
  good 
you like salami 
he says 
 wait a minute  i have to go back 
 i forgot my teeth on the table  
he says   hell with your teeth 
 what do you think 
they re bombarding with sandwiches  
after the revolution 
you ll buy me a new hat 
thank you very much 
i ll keep you by your word 
by the way  did you hear this one 
a man   
lenin asks 
 why do you let your beard grow  
i says   i want to remember
what i ate yesterday  
this is a hard word 
but it means  i don t smoke  
okay 
 are you one of the family  
he said   no  that s why i m crying  
there s a foreman of a logging camp 
he s trying to hire a crew 
you know  and he goes down
a long line of very big men
and he gets to a little man in the back
and he says   who the hell are you 
what re you doing here 
 don t you know that i need men who
can chop down dozens of trees a day 
 where the hell
have you ever worked before  
and the little man says 
 well  i worked in the sahara forest  
and the foreman says 
 you mean the sahara desert  
and the little man says 
 yes  sure  now  
a woman knocks at the door
of her neighbor 
i didn t tell you that 
she says   my husband just died 
i want to sell his jacket  
he says 
 what s the matter with the pants  
she says   the pants  i wear  
the russian border 
the russian border 
he s already fighting for three months 
now he joined the bolsheviks
and he s not going to fight anymore 
i don t think he s afraid 
there are many bolsheviks in the army 
and the bolsheviks will stop the war 
he s 14 years old 
the communists obviously wanted
peace  rightly so 
because the country was completely
unable to sustain a war 
there was treason
and there was corruption 
there was everything under the sun 
but certainly   
there was certainly no possibility
of conducting a war 
kerensky was anxious to conduct it 
produce some battalions of women
who were going to go and fight 
jack reed 
alex  what the hell are you doing here 
  you have someone to meet you 
  no 
then what luck i am here 
  lois 
  yes 
alex gomberg 
  looking for accommodation 
  no  just a hotel 
more good luck 
i know of an empty apartment 
you have transportation 
no problem  follow me 
a lot of people had an idea
that utopia was growing up 
i could not blame them
for being pro bolshevik 
but i wasn t 
the one person
who was awfully ignorant about russia
  was beatrice webb 
  yes  she was 
she didn t know a thing 
do not be misled by the quiet
in the streets 
underneath is great tension 
alex  how much time
has the kerensky government got left 
any day now  the bolsheviks will strike 
fantastic  isn t it 
a quiet street 
and yet we are in the heart of petrograd 
give him four rubles 
jack  lois  lucky for you  i am here 
yeah  thanks  thanks again 
only one bed  that s a double 
single  that s a single 
this is where i ii   
this is good for me  i can just   
good 
i don t mind this at all 
he s calling for an insurrection 
isn t he 
day and night  day and night 
 another insurrection will ruin russia  
 another insurrection will save russia  
 the war is ruining russia  
 without england or france 
russia will be isolated  
 the bolsheviks are ruining russia  
lois  lucky for you  i am here 
louise 
  this is the line for bread 
  yes 
there s another line for boots 
and there is still another line for cards
on which they ll get the boots
in two  three months 
did we have to get rid of the czar
to stand in line for bread 
  what does that mean 
  i don t know 
vosstanie means  insurrection  
and  kerensky  means  kerensky  
and bolsheviki means bolshevik 
so i think it calls for an insurrection
by the bolsheviks
against the kerensky government
and the kornilovtsy 
  what s a kornilovtsy 
  louise  i m not that fluent in russian 
look  if they buy this 
they re gonna cut you down
to 400 or 500 words  aren t they 
  that starts out like you got 5 000 
  where would you cut 
i d lose this  i d lose this 
but what s your lead 
oh  i know what you think 
you think the strongman line 
well  i just don t know if you re gonna
take anybody s breath away
with that for a lead  you know 
you re right 
it s too long  it s too general 
and the strongman line
is the best lead 
you ve been right
about something else  too 
the bolsheviks will take russia
out of the war 
  good night 
  night 
 in the streets the talk
is of peace and bread 
 neither of which
kerensky has provided  
 everybody knows that
something is going to happen 
 everybody knows that
something is going to happen 
 but nobody knows just what  
yes 
i m sorry  i don t speak russian 
i m english 
 petrograd does not sleep 
 at night  the arguments grow louder
and the crowds thicken  
 nobody is satisfied with kerensky 
 the far right wants a strongman 
the far left wants peace 
 everyone waits to see
what the bolsheviks will do  
 it is not easy to write fairly about
the bolshevik leader lenin 
 he is absorbed  cold 
impatient of interruptions  
  you re editorializing here 
  i never editorialize 
  at the end 
  you re right  cut it 
what i don t understand is   
why did you take out the piece
about the gunshot  it was very good 
  it is good  isn t it 
  yeah 
put it back in for me 
mr  zinoviev  do you still feel
that the timing is wrong
for a bolshevik insurrection 
 i interviewed zinoviev at smolny 
 he d been in hiding with lenin  
   had another whole decade 
less than a day 
 his style is still that of a man in hiding 
 we hear trotsky speak at smolny 
 if lenin represents thought 
trotsky represents action 
 he is essentially an agitator  
 the meeting hall at smolny
was packed  at one point 
 someone in the platform
asked the comrades not to smoke 
 and everybody  including the smokers
took up the cry 
  don t smoke  comrades   
and then they went on smoking  
 at the point trotsky said 
 we are trying to avoid insurrection 
  but if the kerensky government
attacks us 
  we shall answer blow by blow  
 the audience broke into wild cheers  
 lenin is a strange popular leader 
a leader purely by virtue of intellect 
 colorless  humorless 
uncompromising 
 he seems to have
none of trotsky s force of personality
 or his gift for phrasemaking 
and yet it is lenin who is the architect  
kerensky is some socialist  huh 
 the winter palace of the czar  where
kerensky s government holds office 
   is vast and magnificent    
   it is quiet in the winter palace 
 there s no sign here
of the strikes and lockouts
 that convulse moscow and odessa 
 no evidence that
transportation is paralyzed 
 that the army is starving
and in the big cities  there is no bread  
 kerensky is full of old world manners
and charm  totally unlike lenin  
  provisional government will last  
kerensky said during the interview 
  in spite of the bolsheviks   
 he seemed bitter  defensive  
900 000 men deserted
since january the 1st 
that s 14  of the russian army  i   
i m sort of braising the cabbage 
 cause i thought it d be a nice change 
you know that house
where rhys williams is staying 
evidently  the banker s daughter
came home in hysterics the other night 
 cause some woman streetcar
conductor called her  comrade  
so after dinner  they all voted
they preferred the germans
to the bolsheviks by 10 to one 
anyway  the social revolutionaries
asked the british ambassador
to please not to mention their visit 
because they were already considered
too far to the right 
and you know 
it s the same group of people
you couldn t even see a year ago 
 cause they were too far to the left 
karsavina is dancing tonight 
and  oh  manny komroff says
that charlie chaplin will be   
jack   
thanks for bringing me here 
will they strike 
do you speak english 
do you speak english 
do you speak english 
do you speak english 
do you speak english 
do you speak english 
  do you speak english 
  yes 
will they strike 
  new york 
  yes 
  you know broome street 
  yes 
i know 
but can you tell me what he s saying 
  i lived there four years 
  really  what s he   
what is he saying 
can you tell me what he s saying 
he says don t strike 
he says it s not right
to leave our russian soldiers
at front without guns 
you are a long way from new york 
he says that our russian
soldiers at the front
are also strike 
that is why they re leaving the front 
what s that 
he said that the workers of england 
france and america
will be left alone to fight germany 
tell him he doesn t know
how many workers
in england  france and america
are against the war 
you lived in new york  tell him that 
you are right  american 
go ahead  you speak 
go ahead 
tell them about your american workers 
no  i can t speak here  i don t have
any credentials to speak here 
  i m an american   
  credentials  what credentials 
everyone has credentials here 
he ask you to speak 
speak  i translate 
i only want to say that if you strike 
the american workers
will not feel betrayed 
they re waiting for your example 
they re waiting for your leadership 
if you refuse to support
the capitalist war machine 
they will follow your example 
and if workers of the world
stand together 
the war can be stopped 
they support you
and will join you in revolution 
then  comrades  come rally
and the last fight
let us face
the internationale
unites the human race
then  comrades  come rally
and the last fight
let us face
the internationale
unites the human race
that s how it goes 
porter

i ll take it with me to washington

  attorney general 
  attorney general of the united states

  louise 
  max

on women in the revolution 
and then we re gonna help
edit each other s books 
no more separations 
we ve really promised each other  max 
we re really going to get down
to living our own lives 
it s so moving 
god  max  you should ve been there 
well  they took my notes 
every goddamn note i have for my book 
can they do that 
welcome home  let s go 
come on  come on 
we ll get your notes back 
you ll write your book 
a lot s been happening  now what
the hell is going on here  jack 
i understand you and louise
have decided to be happy 
it s a very difficult situation
for a country who is conducting a war 
when one of its allies has a revolution
and the government is changed 
the thing that made the furor
was that the russians withdrew 
and we lost an ally 
we thought the russians
had gone back on us 
the bolshevik revolution  at the time 
was the most single striking
event in the history of the times 
of the whole era 
the complete transformation
of russian society 
and the taking over
by the peasants and the workers
of the machinery of the state 
it never had happened before in history 
you re a grand old flag
you re a high flying flag
and forever and e er may you wave
you re the emblem of
the land i love
the home of the free and the brave
every heart beats true
for the red  white and blue
where there s never a boast or brag
should auld acquaintance be forgot
keep your eye on the grand old flag
over there is not till 1918 
over there  over there
send the word  send the word
over there
that the yanks are coming   
you know that one 
but the other one
after grand old flag 
or before  was
i m a yankee doodle dandy 
i m a yankee doodle dandy
yankee doodle   
real live nephew of my uncle sam
born on the 4th of july
i ve got a yankee doodle sweetheart
she s my yankee doodle joy
yankee doodle went to london
just to ride the ponies
i am the yankee doodle boy
that was a big hit 
  do you believe in god 
  i beg your pardon 
it s a simple question  miss bryant 
now do you want me to repeat it 
i m sorry  for a moment i thought
you asked me
if i believed there s a god 
that is precisely what i asked you 
i see  well  i have no way of knowing 
are you a christian 
i was christened in the catholic church 
  well  are you a christian now 
  i suppose i am 
do you believe
in our lord jesus christ 
i believe in the teachings of christ 
am i being tried for witchcraft 
miss bryant  tell me 
are there no decent  god fearing
christians among the bolsheviks 
does one have to be god fearing
and christian to be decent 
senator  the bolsheviks believe
that it s religion  particularly christianity 
that s kept the russian people back
for so many centuries 
  miss bryant   
  lf any of you d ever been to russia
and seen the peasants 
you might think they had a point 
on the subject of decency  senator 
the bolsheviks took power
with the slogan   an end to the war  
within six months  they made good
their promise to the russian people 
now  the present president
of the united states of america
went to this country in 1916 
on a  no war  ticket 
within six months 
he d taken us into the war 
and 115 000 young americans
didn t come back 
if that s how decent 
god fearing christians behave 
give me atheists anytime 
by the way  senator overman 
in russia  women have the vote 
which is more than you can say
for this country 
miss bryant 
do you advocate a soviet government
for this country 
no  in this country
i don t think it would work 
in other words 
you mean the red scare 
they got scared  or we got scared 
no  we didn t get scared 
they were afraid that the unions
would grow in strength 
a radical movement in america 
they were scared 
oh  sure 
the americans  they were frightened
to death by it  you know 
that it could occur here 
sure  everybody was in mortal dread
of the government descending on them 
the fbi or whatever it was 
don t you know 
we had to expose them 
and once they told american people
what communism was   
people won t have nothing to do
with communism now 
they know what it is 
but then  they didn t know 
it was a new thing 
public opinion was
solidly against anyone
who had a good word
for the russian revolution 
but louise was always communicating
what she had experienced 
i brought blankets  here 
and a heavy coat  here 
chase and sanborn 
gloves 
thank you  jack 
everyone else brought me hats 
and louise sends you her best and this 
a scarf  very kind 
i m afraid your time is up 
well 
we re going to keep fighting this 
will you tell max i d like a picture
of myself in the magazine 
and under it  i would like the words 
 deported in 1919 
 the government of the most
powerful country in the world
 is afraid of this woman  
we re going to get you back  e g 
the revolution needs you 
we re gonna get you back 
comrade  i m not leaving
the revolution 
in russia  i ll be joining it 
i urged the deportation of all
alien communists 
all alien communists 
it s bad enough having
a communist with us 
but to have alien communists
who are not citizens 
denouncing our form
of government and our republic
and everything else 
they should be deported 
and i led a big fight on that
for a long while 
it wasn t a very healthy atmosphere 
so when john reed came along 
well  he was a voice of what i love 
he was able to go into the most
controversial subject of all 
communism  bolshevism 
he was considered one of the rare
persons who could do a thing like that 
he knew he was
on the threshold of history 
and he wrote it that way 
  a touch of this   
  jack  i m back 
i m in here  honey 
i talked to edmund and alfred today
at liveright s 
  what a day it s turned out to be 
  stay out  honey  stay out  stay out 
what are you doing in there 
is everything okay 
  can t i help 
  no  no  no  no 
sure smells good  what is it 
stay out  honey 
what did edmund have to say 
stay out  honey 
what did edmund have to say 
he said in a few weeks
the steelworkers will strike 
he thinks at least 200 000 of them 
and maybe as many as 300 000 
but he doesn t think there s
any stopping them this time 
yeah  that s good 
you still thinking
about doing a piece on it  i am 
well  i can t really talk now 
but what does he say the next step is 
evidently the federal government s
saying the steel organizers are reds 
so what they re doing is
forming a bureau of investigation
just to look into subversive activity 
and you know  with all this talk
about the leadership of the af of l
being in cahoots with the steel trust 
alfred asked me if i was still gonna do
the piece on the iww 
so i said   alfred  for the moment
i don t want to go any further away
   than new jersey  
  really 
oh  that s good  that s good 
  just   
  yeah  it is good 
sit down  i ll just be a minute 
jack  what are you doing 
  how did you leave it with edmund 
  he s gonna read the piece on debs 
okay  the first course 
  yeah 
  sit down 
sit down and close your eyes  sit down 
okay 
oh  my 
my   
  go ahead 
  oh 
what do you think 
really  you serious 
really  thank god 
i was gonna flambé them out here 
but the goddamn things flambéed
themselves in the pan 
he was certainly the main inspiration
in the development
of a revolutionary movement
through his history
of ten days that shook the world 
ten days that shook the world
was  of course  his masterpiece 
he was there when
the bolshevik revolution took place 
and his was the best report of it 
max eastman had this story
that john reed came down 
tousled hair all  you know   
and said he was writing a book
and not to disturb him for ten days 
and that became
ten days that shook the world 
supposedly 
he was an enormous 
enormous success 
and this success
largely changed his whole life  i think 
 cause he found out there was
something that he could do well 
do practically better than anyone else 
 comrades  we have made
a great stride forward in our program
 to capture
the socialist party for revolution 
 the time of right wing domination
of the party has ended 
 they have fallen before the shining
example of revolutionary russia
 like so many bowling pins 
 comrades  we have done better
than we could have dreamed 
 the left wing has won 12
of the 15 seats
 on the socialist party executive 
 including myself 
edmund macalpine and jack reed  
he took a tremendous jump forward
from there on 
he became a revolutionist
on the workers  side 
and he had no more illusions
about people like wilson 
we all have problems 
you can t escape having problems 
don t you know 
but to take on the problem
of all humanity 
to save all humanity 
my god  that was too big
even for jesus christ 
don t you know
he got himself crucified 
how the hell do we expect
to do those things 
oh 
louise  is that you 
hello  harry 
well  where have you been lately 
i haven t seen you in a long time 
that s right 
is this thing gonna last all day 
it might  we ve been kicked out 
  kicked out of what 
  the socialist party 
  wait  wait  who got kicked out 
  everybody in that room 
the executive committee
kicked us all out 
  the whole left wing 
  that s right  they nullified the election 
  can they do that 
  they ve done it 
we re the majority  we have the votes 
we weren t expelled
by the membership 
we were expelled by the executives 
and you re talking about doing exactly
what the executive committee
wants us to do 
give the party back to them
without a fight 
yes  and organize our own party 
goddamn it  louis 
the socialist party is our own party 
we were voted into power
by its membership
and we can t be expelled
by the executives 
it s an illegal act  and if we fight it
at the convention  we ll win 
why do we have to fight 
what do you mean 
 why do we have to fight  
for what do we stay in a party
in which we must win control
from the minority  not once  but twice 
well  what is it  louis  you mean 
if we must fight for what we deserve 
then to hell with it 
is that your idea of revolution 
i d like to hear more about
your revolutionary concept  louis 
my idea of revolution
is not a revolution in my own party 
and my idea of a socialist party
is not a debating society 
it is a party of action 
fine  fine 
the best example we can give them
is go to that convention
and take control of the party 
no  we form our own party 
and i hope that everybody here
who believe in bolshevism
will be there that night
to help found that party 
all right  but i say you re wrong 
and i say that i m gonna be there
at that socialist party convention
to take the seat that belongs to me 
and i urge everyone here today
to be there to take the seats
that belong to you 
it s almost like they want to be
separated from the masses 
they do want to be separated
from the masses  that s the point 
let s go 
i ve been in a minority before 
hello 
while he liked the draft manifesto 
he s a bit nervous
about the social patriot clause 
  excuse me 
  tactically  he s gonna be trouble 
is he gonna bring his people
to the convention or not 
the man will talk theory
with you all year 
well  i don t think so 
he ll go with fraina 
isn t that nice  he likes the manifesto 
how about carnofsky 
i don t think we re gonna have
as much support as we thought  jack 
we re gonna get in 
what did carnofsky say 
  carnofsky said no 
  i m telling you  jack   
  just knowing on our own   
  half of fraina s people would come   
come in 
louise  please keep her quiet  will you 
  hi  eddie 
  how can   
  hello  eddie 
  hello  louise  ben 
hey 
eddie  what about levine 
  eddie 
  yeah 
  what did levine say 
  he never showed  he   
i waited over an hour 
  levine didn t show 
  that doesn t sound like levine 
sure it does  where were you meeting 
in casey s 
now  that surprises me 
that really surprises me 
i could have missed him 
it was really busy in there 
  you could have missed him 
  what s that supposed to mean 
i was late 
how late 
forty  forty five minutes 
nora started spitting up blood
again this morning 
i had to take her to the clinic 
and i had to wait for my mother
to come and pick up the kid 
so you were 45 minutes late 
yeah  i thought i could make it 
i really did 
all right  we gotta get in touch
with the guy  how do we do it 
he s on his way to chicago 
that s one of the reasons
i thought he would still be there 
wait a minute 
you thought he d still be there 
  yeah 
  who asked for the meeting  eddie 
  who asked for the meeting 
  who asked for the meeting 
  did levine want the meeting 
  yeah  i thought he wanted it 
did he call us 
no  we called him 
then why would he wait 
we wanted the meeting 
i m sorry 
well  why didn t you call one of us
and get somebody to take your place 
because i thought i could make it 
i mean  i thought the man
would still be there 
you thought  you thought  you thought 
try not to think too much  eddie 
not when your comrades
are depending on you 
be sure 
all right  look 
do we have a contact
for levine in chicago 
let s call singer 
  do you have a number for him 
  yeah  well  i ve probably got it 
here 
thanks 
you know  they might work better
if you put something in your stomach
besides coffee 
you re a little hard on eddie 
aren t you  under the circumstances 
you think my sympathies
can help eddie s wife 
might help eddie 
listen to me 
building a party will help eddie 
four  eight  twelve   
you know  i think we all believe
in the same things 
but with us 
it s more or less our good intentions 
and with jack  it s a religion 
our old friend jack s
getting serious on us 
okay  hey  frank  how are you 
how are you 
excuse me  what s happening here 
no one s admitted without a red card 
that s the order of the executive 
well  i m on the executive 
so is he  so is he   
  no one s admitted without a red card 
  where do we get the red cards 
you ll have to take that up
with the credentials committee 
and where s
the credentials committee 
and where s
the credentials committee 
i don t know 
i don t think he wants us to go in there 
well  the way to take the hall
is to take the hall 
edmund 
edmund  jack 
okay  let s go  let s go 
come on  this way 
to propose the agenda 
i would like to read a message
from the credentials committee
to the floor 
may we please have order back there 
in the back of the hall  could we have   
sergeant at arms  would you see
what s going on back there 
ladies and gentlemen  it seems
we have a group of intruders
who are trying to take over
this conference 
we re not going to let them 
now  please  please sit down 
i need these aisles clear 
sergeant at arms 
i must have these aisles clear 
please  everyone  sit down 
now  these are bolshevik sympathizers
who are trying to take over this party 
and we re not going to let them 
the police are coming 
these people aren t socialists 
these people are just thugs 
now you see  that is bolshevik tactics 
come on  delegates 
these people are imposters 
they were not elected
to the leadership of this party 
ladies and gentlemen 
the police are coming 
  you see  the police 
  what the hell is this 
that s the only way the executive
committee can stay in power 
is by the use of the capitalist police 
flash your red cards 
they ll resort to any tactics
to keep the working class
away from its true leadership
because they re afraid of revolution 
officers  whoever has no red card
does not belong in this room 
hold up your red cards 
it s all right  we re going 
you don t have to throw us out 
if you want to know
where the true leadership
of the socialist party of america is 
it ll be in the basement of this building
in five minutes   
  red cards  everybody 
   and you re welcome to join us 
i want anybody who does not have
a red card to be out of this hall 
comrade chairman  i move that
we immediately constitute ourselves
as the bona fide communist party 
and that we call ourselves
the communist labor party of america 
i second that motion 
well  look  if we re gonna have
a really revolutionary party 
i think what we have to do
is to find out from the american worker
what he wants the most and then
we have to translate it back to him
in terms of the labor movement
as a whole 
what we have to do
is make him want more 
we have to make him want
the whole goddamn revolution 
those people upstairs
think that karl marx was somebody
who wrote a good antitrust law 
and whether we call our party
the socialist labor party
or the real socialist communist   
whatever we call the party 
it doesn t matter because it   
hello  lou  are you lost 
no  i m not lost 
i m here to tell my friends
that the newly formed
communist party of america
is meeting at the russian federation
on blue island avenue 
we welcome your applications 
they will be judged
on an individual basis 
you re gonna judge our applications 
we re gonna apply to you
for membership 
comrade chairman 
i d like to call that question  please 
the motion has been made
and seconded that
we immediately constitute ourselves
as the bona fide communist party
and that we call ourselves
the communist labor party of america 
all those in favor 
please signify by saying aye 
aye 
opposed  motion is carried 
comrades  comrades 
comrades  this is the wrong time
to be fighting against one another 
we should be united in our struggle
against the capitalists 
you should have thought of that
six weeks ago  louis 
if your people had stayed with us 
we d have had a majority 
and we d be in control
of that convention upstairs 
we have five times your membership 
louis  your arithmetic s
something like your politics 
we will be at the russian federation
on blue island avenue 
i hope to see some of you there 
comrade chairman  i move we
immediately send a delegate to moscow
to gain recognition by the comintern
for the communist labor party
of america 
  and that delegate be jack reed 
  second the motion 
the motion has been made
and seconded to send jack reed
to moscow immediately
as the international delegate
to obtain recognition of the comintern
for the communist labor party
of america 
all those in favor 
please signify by saying aye 
aye 
opposed  motion is carried 
since the first question
i m going to be asked   
all right  thank you 
all right  comrades  since
the first question i m gonna be asked
by the comintern is gonna be
about membership eligibility 
i think i m gonna have to be very clear
what our position is
in relation to
the foreign language federation 
i m gonna have to say exactly
what our requirements are
as opposed to any other group 
and i think we ll have to make it clear
on our platform committee
and be very clear in the manifesto 
  good luck in moscow  jack 
  okay  harry 
well  i guess you boys think
you can run a newspaper without me 
hello  jessie 
good girl 
  hello 
  hello 
let me make it easy for you  jack 
i m not going with you 
and if you go  i m not sure i ll be here
when you get back 
louise  you know  the comintern
doesn t know edmund or alfred
from the new york yankees 
they know me 
somebody s got to go over there
who s got a background 
we d be back by christmas 
we can t merge with fraina 
we can t deal with him
on membership eligibility 
he wouldn t accept half of our people 
the man is gonna do nothing
but alienate himself
from any potential
broad base of support 
he s sociologically isolated 
programmatically he s impossible
to deal with   
you mean he s a foreigner 
don t do that  louise 
six months ago  you were friends 
these people can barely speak english 
they don t even want to be integrated
into american life 
the foreign language federations
aren t gonna create bolshevism
in america any more
than eating borscht will 
being russian
doesn t make a revolution 
do you think the american workers
are gonna be led
by the russian federations 
or an insular italian like louis fraina 
he has no possibility
of leading a revolution in this country 
unlike you 
i m just saying
that the revolution in this country
is not gonna be led by immigrants 
revolution  in this country 
when  jack  just after christmas 
well  what do you think
we could ve done with the steel strike
if we d been ready 
30 000 party members all armed
with a unified theory and program
leading 365 000 steelworkers 
what it takes is leadership 
and we gotta get it
by getting recognition from moscow 
  i have to go 
  you don t have to go 
you want to go  you want to go running
all over the world ranting and raving
and making resolutions
and organizing caucuses 
what s the difference
between the communist party
and the communist labor party
except that you re running one
and he s running the other 
  i ve made a commitment 
  to what 
to the fine distinction between
which half of the left of the left
is recognized by moscow as
the real communist party in america 
to petty political squabbling between
humorless and hack politicians
just wasting their time
on left wing dogma 
to getting the endorsement
of a committee in russia
you call the international
for your group of 14 intellectual friends
in the basement
who are supposed to tell the workers
of this country what they want 
whether they want it or not 
write  jack 
you re not a politician  you re a writer 
and your writing has done more
for the revolution
than 20 years of this infighting can do 
and you know it 
you re an artist  jack 
don t go 
don t run away
from what you do the best 
jack 
i ll be back by christmas 
i m going into the city 
when do you leave 
tomorrow 
  i see 
  i ll be back by christmas 
will you be here 
i don t know  i ll see you when i see you 
here  your passport and papers 
your name s james gormley 
go now 
well  mrs  reed  sit down 
what can i do for you 
hello  gene  how are you 
fine  and you 
i m fine 
sit down 
  how s jack 
  he s fine  he s in russia 
  is he 
  yes 
he s trying to get recognition
from the comintern
for the communist labor party 
you see  they ve split
into two different factions 
and you 
left alone with your work again 
no 
well  actually  yes 
but my work is different now 
i do a lot of lecturing
about what i saw in russia 
ah  yes  russia 
russia s been good for you and jack 
given you a way to meet people 
given him a reason to leave home 
russia 
russia 
are you really that cynical 
or are you angry with me 
i m really that cynical 
why would i be angry with you 
gene  if you d been to russia 
you d never be cynical
about anything again 
you would have seen
people transformed  ordinary people 
louise  something in me tightens when
an american intellectual s eyes shine
and they start to talk to me
about the russian people 
  wait   
  something in me says   watch it 
 a new version of irish catholicism
is being offered for your faith  
  it s not like that 
  and i wonder why
a lovely wife like louise reed
who s just seen the brave new world
is sitting around
with a cynical bastard like me
instead of trotting all over russia
with her idealistic husband 
it s almost worth being converted 
well  i was wrong to come 
you and jack have a lot of
middle class dreams for two radicals 
jack dreams that he can hustle
the american working man 
whose one dream is to be rich enough
not to have to work 
into a revolution led by his party 
and you dream that if you discuss
the revolution with a man
before you go to bed with him 
it ll be missionary work rather than sex 
i m sorry to see you and jack
so serious about your sports 
it s particularly disappointing
in you  louise 
you had a lighter touch
when you were touting free love 
boy  you ve become quite the critic 
haven t you  gene 
just leaned back and analyzed us all 
duplicitous women who tout free love
and then get married 
power mad journalists
who join the revolution
instead of observing it 
middle class radicals
who come looking for sex
and then talk about russia 
it must seem so contemptible
to a man like you
who has the courage to sit on his ass
and observe human inadequacy
from the inside of a bottle 
well  i ve never seen you
do anything for anyone 
i ve never seen you
give anything to anyone 
so i can understand why you might
suspect the motives of those who have 
but whatever jack s motives are  how   
i seem to have touched a wound 
you re a wounding son of a bitch 
and whatever i ve done to you 
you ve made me pay for it 
louise 
jessie 
hey  jess  come on  come here  jess 
jessie  come here 
jessie 
jessie 
jessie 
  oh 
  good evening 
by the order of the attorney general
of the united states 
a  mitchell palmer 
i have a warrant here
for the arrest of one john silas reed 
look upstairs  frank 
  arrest for what 
  sedition 
  where is he 
  what do you mean by sedition 
lady  don t ask me 
ask woodrow wilson 
just tell me where he is 
i don t suppose there s a chance
of you being a bolshevik agitator 
is there 
why don t you just look around 
and see how agitated you get 
in 1919 
there were no more
than four or five americans
who got into russia
because the country was surrounded
on all sides 
you were actually forbidden to go 
and you could only go illegally 
it was very dangerous
to go through finland 
because the finns
were a white government 
and they were bitterly opposed
to the reds 
they decided to strangle
the revolutionary bolshevik infant
in its cradle 
and 16 armies went into russia
from the east and from the west 
for the purpose
of wiping out the bolsheviks
and wiping out the revolution
and restoring christian civilization
to its rightful place 
speak english 
have a lemon 
you won t see one for a long time 
thank you  i just want to know
if you think that i was clear
  in what i said about   
  eminently clear 
salt 
  salt 
  for the lemon 
thank you 
i see you eat the peel with the lemon 
fights the scurvy  so does the onion 
together  they fight better 
you see  what i really wanted to do
was ask your frank opinion
whether we   
you think we ll get the endorsement
from the committee 
  i ask unofficially  of course 
  unofficially 
unofficially  i don t know 
yeah  well  it s such a   
it s a peculiarly american problem
and i   
  you do think i was clear 
  quite clear 
in this case  however  clarity does not
necessarily guarantee endorsement 
well  i don t know 
in this case  i think perhaps it might 
you know  in fact  i don t   
what i really want to do
is to make a detailed report
for the executive committee to read
on conditions in america 
you see  i d like to deal in that report
with the entire history
of the american federation of labor 
i d like to deal
with its support of the war  you see 
and i m gonna talk
about the persecution of the iww 
i m gonna deal with the rise
of the patrioteering societies 
and the capitulation
of leading socialists 
  i m gonna    am i speaking too quickly 
  no  no  go on 
and so i will deal with
the rising militancy of american labor 
i ll talk about the general strikes
in seattle and winnipeg 
the boston police strike 
i m gonna discuss the plumb plan 
and particularly the attitude
and the policies of the af of l
and iww toward them 
now  after that  i think it s important   
comrade reed  the executive
committee of the comintern
has decided against endorsing
either the communist labor party
or the communist party of america 
and instructs the two parties
to merge forthwith 
sit here  comrade reed 
this time  your usual chair 
as you can see 
is now occupied by your detailed report
on american conditions 
a most penetrating study 
very  very clear 
thank you 
obviously  it wasn t clear enough 
comrade radek 
i think there must have been
some mistake
about my travel arrangements
about my return to the united states 
well  it seems as if i ve been asked
to report to the propaganda bureau 
that is right 
comrade reed 
the executive committee has decided
you are very much needed
at the propaganda bureau 
we plan for you to remain
in soviet russia until july 
you re very welcome
to the bureau of propaganda 
well  thank you very much 
but i thought that these
travel arrangements had been made 
i have to get to the latvian
or the finnish border 
and to which border would you suggest 
comrade reed 
well  i understand that train travel
is very dangerous at the moment   
why does he need a train 
because i have urgent personal
considerations and responsibilities
  in the united states and i   
  of what nature 
  excuse me 
  of what nature 
  i have a family 
  we all have families 
well  i can speak only for myself
and i must see my wife 
it s very urgent 
and i ask only
for a single place on a train 
but you have a place on the train 
you have a place
on the train of this revolution 
you have been like so many others 
the best revolutionaries 
one of the engineers
on the locomotive of this train
that pulls this revolution
on the tracks of historical necessity
laid out for it by the party 
you can t leave us now 
we can t replace you 
  what right do you have you to leave   
  i m not sure 
to do what  to see your wife 
last year at the international congress
i learned that my son
was very ill of typhus 
i didn t go to see my son
because i knew i was needed
where i was placed by the party 
what you don t understand is   
would you like to abandon this moment
in your life 
would you ever get this moment again 
  i am not abandoning the revolution 
  comrade reed  you re a writer 
people know and respect your work 
  you speak with authority of feeling 
  comrade zinoviev 
for the past eight weeks 
i ve been completely unable
to communicate with my wife
or with my comrades
in the united states 
i need to go back  i would like your help 
comrade reed  you can always go back
to your private responsibilities 
so can i 
you can never  never come back
to this moment in history 
i m sorry 
i have no right to tell you
about your own life 
you know it better than i do 
maybe it was impossible
to get out of russia 
there was white armies all around 
so escape was not dreamt of 
we had a communication from jack 
he was in prison in finland
where he couldn t communicate freely 
but he got word out to me
to take a message to louise 
and i remember walking over to louise 
she lived right near me 
i walked over to louise s apartment
on patson place 
and spent an evening with her
talking about jack 
and she talked very earnestly
about jack s plight 
mrs  reed  the united states
cannot involve itself
in the internal affairs of finland 
are you trying to tell me
the american consul
  can t give you any information 
  i m afraid that there s nothing
  that the state department can do 
  don t give me that garbage 
if his name were rockefeller 
there d be something you could do 
mrs  reed  if your husband s name
were rockefeller 
i think he would hardly be
under indictment
for a conspiracy to overthrow
the united states government 
he has only one kidney 
he could be dangerously ill 
that is a chance
that your husband took  mrs  reed 
when he left the united states
without an exit visa or a passport 
good day  mrs  reed 
the united states
participated with the allies
in military expeditions against
the soviet union
in an attempt to overcome them 
invade them 
and set up another government 
oh  yes  yes 
there was a noose
to be pulled around russia
which gave you an idea
of how a whole country
can be surrounded
east  west  south  and north 
your name 
and the name of your contact in finland 
your name 
and the name of your contact in finland 
i don t know what color

  okay 
  oh  okay 
  all right 
  i understand 
from the top 
oh  i see  then they made a map 
terry spoke to me 
louise  i don t think you realize
how difficult this trip to be for a woman 
you d have to stow away 
if you got there at all 
it would take you six months to   
terry said that he thought that
you could arrange a freighter for me
  as far as norway 
  don t know why you re saying it 
you know what i mean 
sit down 
i want to talk to you about something 
   indicates the map 
i could go 
i can sign on as a seaman 
there d be no questions asked 
i think under the circumstances   
don t look at me like that 
jack reed s a friend of mine 
i m not gonna let
the son of a bitch rot in jail 
just seemed to me
that i m not as interested   
   and at this point

where the cross is made

  you also looked under r e l d 
  yes  comrade reed 
  yes  yes  what do you want 
  there s many people wait 
  excuse me 
  lf something come  we ll notify you 
what have you heard 
not much  what have you heard 
i don t hear  i wait 
they ve jailed more anarchists 
but they made bill shatoff
head of the siberian railway 
they treated me very well 
and i m reserving my judgment 
  well  that s wise 
  there s so much i don t understand 
there are forests within easy reach
of petrograd 
why is this city freezing 
i asked zinoviev 
he said our enemies have destroyed
all the means of transportation
and killed off our horses
as well as our men 
how would we get at it 
i said   what about
the people of petrograd 
 they could go there together on foot
and haul the wood back with ropes  
he said   oh  yes  it would make
the people warmer 
 but it would interfere with the carrying
out of the main political policy  
  you get letters from america  e  g 
  oh  yes 
all opened by the justice department 
i hope they enjoy what they read  i don t 
so i asked him 
 what are the main political policies  
he said 
 concentration of all power in the hands
 of the proletarian avant garde 
 the avant garde of the revolution 
which is the communist party  
anybody mention louise 
i don t think so 
you haven t heard from her 
i ve sent her cables 
but i don t get any answer 
  for how long 
  a long time 
wait 
rhys williams
mentioned her in his letter 
he hasn t heard from her  either 
what d he say 
i think he said
that he d tried to reach her
sometime after christmas 
but she d left new york 
how long ago was that 
well  you know how these letters take
a couple of months to get here 
by the time i get them  whoever sent it
is either in jail or deported 
  that s it 
  which 
  there 
  rhys williams 
oh 
  first the eyes go  then the legs 
  yeah 
yeah  i don t understand
the fuel situation  either 
i don t know   
he says she seems to be out of town 
that s all he said 
yeah 
what did he say about o neill 
o neill  nothing 
come on  what did he say 
nothing 
can i see it 
i m sorry 
i just don t know where   
jack  sit down 
if louise were to come here 
she d have to leave
the united states illegally 
then live in exile with you 
and never go home again 
all for the sake of a revolution
she was never any part of 
why should she 
you chose the life of a revolutionary 
she didn t 
your cables only focus the
justice department s attention on her 
and the most seditious thing
they can accuse her of
is being your wife 
leave her alone 
let her choose her own future 
why hasn t she answered me 
i think she has answered you 
he s been released 
they won t tell me where he is 
do you know  she was much hated
for her extravagance in clothes 
well  a long time ago 
somebody said to me 
 people who   
 women whose lives
have been in danger
 over a long period
are always the most extravagant  
comrades  as wrong headed
as many of its policies are 
the iww is a revolutionary union
and the american federation of labor
is not 
to think we can infiltrate
the american federation of labor
and convert it
to revolutionary policies is hopeless 
translation 
comrades  that s the wrong translation 
that s not what he said 
what s he saying 
for us to make a point
on the floor of the congress 
we have to go
from our own english language
into the official german language
to the italian  or spanish 
or french language 
  and then  when the response from   
  what is your question  please 
simply for the labor union issue 
could we have the english language
as an official language
on the floor of the congress 
comrade reed  this is the third time
you have raised this proposal 
the issue has been decided 
we must move on
to the national and colonial issues 
real revolutionary workers
in the united states
quit the af of l a long time ago
and joined the iww 
we have to make
the russians understand this 
and that s why we want your support
to extend the session of congress
and to keep the debate open 
jack  are you okay 
  did you talk to sadoul 
  yes  i did 
comrades  i m still opposed to closing
the discussion here 
i think that this discussion
is being closed
to avoid hearing the american
and the british delegations 
and if for no other reason than that 
it shows that discussion
should continue 
comrade radek
uses this sort of remark
in place of an argument and as a result 
he doesn t want to talk about it 
what reed says is not distinguished
by excessive fear of distorting the truth 
he goes on day and night
and has the cheek to claim
that the discussion is being broken off
because of fear of the great might
of john reed 
comrade reed  you may have time
to discuss it until tomorrow morning 
other people do not have the time 
comrade radek  other people that
don t have the time for this discussion
are 101 leaders of the iww
who are in jail today
in the united states
because of their revolutionary views 
and if we turn our back
on these comrades
out of some pipe dream to radicalize
the american federation of labor
which cannot be done  it is a disgrace 
we ve discussed this
during six sessions of this commission 
we spent whole day today discussing it 
and you insinuate
we are trying to dismiss the issue 
we haven t had enough discussion   
we haven t had enough discussion
for my friend here
to realize that louis fraina and i
think alike on this problem 
every american on our delegation 
  every man on the english delegation   
  you are a member of this committee 
you are not
an independent political party 
comrade zinoviev  i will not be
steamrollered by this committee
that has not had
a proper education on this problem 
on the fact   
the discussion is closed 
however  if comrade reed
wishes to make a statement 
he will have two minutes to do so 
i would merely want to say that
on behalf of the american delegates 
that we will refuse
to vote on these theses 
and that i myself
will resign my seat on this committee 
jack  i think we have to face it 
the dream that we had
is dying in russia 
if bolshevism means
the peasants taking the land 
the workers taking the factories 
russia s one place
where there s no bolshevism 
you know  i can argue with cops 
i can fight with generals 
i can t deal with a bureaucrat 
you think zinoviev is nothing worse
than a bureaucrat 
the soviets have no more
local autonomy 
the central state has all the power 
all the power
is in the hands of a few men
and they are destroying the revolution 
they are destroying any hope
of real communism in russia 
they re putting people like me in jail 
my understanding of revolution
is not a continual extermination
of political dissenters 
and i want no part of it 
every single newspaper s
been shut down
or taken over by the party 
anyone even vaguely suspected
of being a counter revolutionary
can be taken out and shot
without a trial  where does that end 
is any nightmare justifiable
in the name of defense
against counter revolution 
the dream may be dying in russia 
but i m not 
it may take some time  i m getting out 
you sound like you re a little confused
by the revolution in action  e g 
up to now 
you ve only dealt with it in theory 
what did you think
this thing was gonna be 
a revolution by consensus
where we all sat down
and agreed over a cup of coffee 
nothing works 
four million people died last year 
not from fighting a war 
they died from starvation and typhus
in a militaristic police state
that suppresses
freedom and human rights
where nothing works 
they died because of a
french  british and american blockade
that cut off
all food and medical supplies
and because counter revolutionaries
have sabotaged the factories
and the railroads and the telephones 
and because the people 
the poor  ignorant 
superstitious  illiterate people 
are trying to run things themselves 
just as you always said that they should 
but they don t know
how to run them yet 
did you really think things would work
right away 
did you really expect
social transformation
to be anything other than
a murderous process 
it s a war  e g  
and we gotta fight it like we fight a war 
with discipline 
with terror  with firing squads 
or we just give it up 
those four million people
didn t die fighting a war 
they died from a system
that cannot work 
it s just the beginning  e g 
it s not happening
the way we thought it would 
it s not happening
the way we wanted it to 
but it s happening 
if you walk out on it now 
what s your whole life meant 
could you tell me if my resignation
is ready for signature yet 
  it is 
  good 
may i see it 
thank you 
  thank you  comrade reed 
  welcome back  comrade reed 
now you ll be able to represent
the american workers
at the forthcoming congress at baku
to inspire revolution among the peoples
of the middle east 
prepare for a difficult trip 
our only route
is through divided territory 
some of these intellectuals
spread rumors
that he changed his mind afterwards 
trying to  you know 
show that he came to his senses 
it s preposterous 
these men  well 
i don t even remember them 
i don t want to remember them 
all trains to baku canceled
because of attacks
by counter revolutionaries 
there must be some train to baku 
all trains to baku canceled
because of attacks
by counter revolutionaries 
there has to be something to baku 
louise 
emma 
emma 
emma 
how in the name of god
did you get into russia 
  i had no idea how long it would take 
  so  you ll wait for a while 
by the time you got there 
he d be back here anyway 
go on in  go on in 
oh  i m sorry 
it s all right  it s all right 
here  louise  sit down  sit down 
i want to tell you something 
it s late  i know 
i want to thank you for that scarf 
oh  yes 
i was wrong about you 
so was i 
the american oil companies
are trying to establish
a world monopoly of oil 
in 1898  the filipinos rebelled against
the cruel colonial government of spain 
but after the spaniards
had been driven out   
the americans have promised
the filipinos independence 
soon an independent filipino republic
will be proclaimed 
the government of united states
sent soldiers and sailors there   
   under a dictatorship
worse than the british tyrants 
what s that for 
they are supporting you
for your call for a holy war
of islamic people against
the western infidels 
excuse me  comrade reed 
they said you are not happy
with the translations of your speech 
i did the german into turkic
and comrade ossinsky
did the russian into german 
russian 
who turned it into russian
in the first place 
well  i don t know 
they were already in russian
when we got them
from the office of comrade zinoviev 
  i m sorry for my english 
  your english is fine  comrade 
zinoviev  did you do
the translations of my speech 
i supervised it  yes 
i didn t say  holy war  
i said  class war  
i took a liberty
of altering a phrase or two 
yes  well  i don t allow people
to take those liberties with what i write 
aren t you propagandist enough
to utilize what moves people most 
i m propagandist enough
to utilize the truth 
and who defines this truth 
you or the party 
is your life dedicated to speaking for   
you don t talk about what
my life is dedicated to 
your life  you haven t resolved
what your life is dedicated to 
you see yourself as an artist
and at the same time as a revolutionary 
as a lover to your wife  but also as a
spokesman for the american classes 
zinoviev  you don t think
a man can be an individual
and be true to the collective 
or speak for his own country
and the international at the same time 
or love his wife
and still be faithful to the revolution 
you don t have a self to give 
would you ever be willing
to give yourself to this revolution 
when you separate a man
from what he loves the most 
what you do is purge
what s unique in him 
and when you purge
what s unique in him 
  you purge dissent 
  comrade reed 
and when you purge dissent 
you kill the revolution 
revolution is dissent 
  comrade reed 
  you don t rewrite what i write 
comrade reed  counter revolutionaries 
counter revolutionaries 
comrade reed 
papa 
papa 
don t leave me 
please don t leave me 
comrade  the doctor
would like to see you now 
the doctor thinks
that we must do more analysis 
and a picture of his illness
will be clearer in a few days 
and he wants you to know
that we shall do the best conditions
for comrade reed
to prevent possibility
of high blood pressure
to cause a stroke 
i really    i know   
what 
how are you 
no 
jack 
you know  i don t    i don t   
you hear it 
  huh 
  what was that 
the water plays little songs 
it s not december  is it 
my  my  my  my 
god  what a time it was  huh 
  want to come to new york with me 
  new york 
i got a taxi waiting 
i wouldn t mind 
what as 
what as 
what as 
gee  i don t know 
comrades 
comrades 
well  i want to go home 
yeah 
i ll get you some water 
oh  god 
it was in the afternoon 
sometime in the fall  i think 
october  i think 
somebody came to tell me
that jack reed died 
you can imagine how   
how i felt 
i d forgotten all about them 
were they socialists 
many of them were idealists 
you know 
things go and come back again 
i don t know what the outside world
thought of them 
but they were a couple 
i mean  you always spoke
of louise bryant and jack reed 
he was just a man in the prime of life 
i don t even know 
did they ever have any children 
they probably didn t have any children 
he and louise 
again  you can t tell 
when you have children 
whether they will carry on
your revolutionary tradition or not 
why did he do it 
well  it s impossible to say
why edison invented 
or why galli curci sang   
he was definitely a stirrer up of people 
that was his field 
that s what he came to do  apparently 
he s well known amongst a few 
but not everybody 
they don t know who in heck he is 
i look for myself to die any day 
he was asked by lenin 
 are you an american  
he said   yes  
and lenin said 
 an american american  
and reed said   yes  
of course 
nobody goes with the idea of dying 
everybody wants to live
