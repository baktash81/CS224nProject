does bulletproof glass stop
a 762 armorpiercing round
frank why did you stop the car

i think we lost them
think again
thought complete lets go
what do you mean
you cant find him
hes one man in one car
hes a chauffeur for christs sakes
not exactly sir we think theres
a possibility he may have been in on it
thats impossible
how would you know
hes been working here for a month
he couldve been setting this up
the whole time and you wouldnt
have known any different
you are such an expert on
knowing people  his background
hes exspecial forces head of an
elite commando unit for five years
specialized in search and destroy
been in and out of lebanon
syria sudan the man is a hunter
i dont care what his skills are
i dont care where hes from
this is not a war zone
this is an american city
wheres my son

youre quite a guy
another time
another place
you and me baby
the pleasure we could have
beauty
frank
frank
frank
not what you expected when
you reported for work this morning
is it frank no
is that what passes
for wit in this circle
in this circle my friend
wit is not a requirement of the job
brutality yes
an ability to inflict pain
absolutely
a certain psychotic moral ignorance
blind obedience all required
but not wit
how was it
fun
only the beginning my love
whats this all about
a timely question max
pardon me
hello
put me on the speaker so you dont
have to repeat the instructions
in the next two hours youll get
5 million in nonsequential 100 bills
you put them in
a waterproof suitcase
you go to the
bayfront park personally
there will be a blue chrysler
parked on the sand
you place the suitcase
in the trunk and you leave
i dont know if i can get
five million dollars in two hours
mr billings please
i read the newspapers
the day you were appointed
to your current position
your net worth exceeded
100 million dollars
so you wont even feel the bite
what guarantee do i have
that you wont harm my son
guarantee mr billings huh
im not a car dealer
dont let the charming accent
and my grammatical
impeccable syntax mislead you
i live in the jungle
and in the jungle
you either eat or be eaten
but in the spirit of doing business
here is the guarantee
ten minutes past the deadline if the
money doesnt arrive i send a finger
twenty minutes a hand
thirty minutes a foot
sounds like we have a deal
dont we mr billings
you have a deal
could we please speak to our son
mommy mommy
you have two hours mr billings
starting now
just get my son
all right all right
frank you promised you
wouldnt let anybody hurt me
you promised

its frank dont hang up
pretend its someone else
hi susan
uh no im just here at home
i didnt do it audrey she had
a gun on jack i had no choice
yeah i saw that
what do you know
its more than a kidnapping
they called and asked for a ransom
the doctors there were fake
they were trying to give jack a shot
when i interrupted them
audrey i promised jack
i wouldnt let anyone hurt him
im not gonna break that promise
frank
ill call you back
audrey
is everything all right
thats a pretty stupid question to
ask right now dont you think jeff
all right so tell me again
inspector tarconi
why you didnt immediately
identify yourself as a police officer
oh i was uh overwhelmed by the
effectiveness of your operation
and the sophistication
of your equipment
you know i work in a small
office in small town
we only have small crimes
i must admit
i was a little insecure
and you and frank martin
are friends right
a friend oh i wouldnt say
exactly a friend
i know him
we have a relationship
a long relationship
not so long
but they found you cookin
in his house  im french
so
we dont need to know someone
for a long time
in order to cook for them
its our way of breaking the ice
take for example you
this sandwich and coffee
you will pardon me to think so
but its not very good
yeah i know it sucks but what
does that got to do with anything
do you have a kitchen
stay back stay back
dont move
smith drop it
fuck
aah
i just found this
oh jesus
what happened
well take care of it for you
are you sure this is safe
look over your shoulder
we got you covered
as my mother used to say
a meal is only limited
by your imagination  hmm
thats créme brulée
and croque monsieur
cream brulée
créme brulée
croque monsieur
croque monsieur
oui
where are you
cooking
cooking can you talk
speak of the devil my mother
mom
please um do you mind
thank you
may i ask who youre cooking for
for the us marshals
but once they found my badge
they were very polite
they gave me coffee
and a sandwich
you wouldnt believe what passes
for food in this place frank
but im correcting the situation
while they wait for my chief
to call back and confirm everything
of course that might take a while
hes never there
anything about me  yes
they are very interested about you
they want to know where you are
where are you
nowhere for very long
listen hold on
do you have access to a computer
its years since having access
to something decent
oh handsome fellow
who is he
thats what i need to know
do they have an id program
youll forgive me
but im not so used to this system
back home there is
one computer for 10 of us
so how is it with you frank
its a complicated story
you mean you are in the shit
you might say that
in other words
youre not arrested
ah voilà a russian biologist
with advanced degrees
from the state laboratory for
biological warfare in siberia

the ransom is still there
thanks the ransom still
hasnt been picked up

kidnapping cases in two years

the ransom im gonna get my son back
audrey dont make this any more
complicated than it already is
im not making this complicated
jefferson its because of your job
what does my job

it has everything to do with it
dont you understand because you
became famous we became the targets
and no matter what
any of you all think
the only one whos out there
trying to get jack back is frank
frank the chauffeur
you spoke with frank martin
and didnt tell us about it
what the hell are you
doing talking to him
because he is the last
person who saw jack alive
