he s one man in one car 
he s a chauffeur  for christ s sakes

a possibility he may have been in on it 
  that s impossible 
  how would you know 
he s been working here for a month 
he could ve been setting this up   
the whole time and you wouldn t
have known any different 
  you are such an expert on
knowing people    his background

elite commando unit for five years   
specialized in search and destroy 
been in and out of lebanon 
syria  sudan  the man is a hunter

beauty 
frank 
frank 
frank 
not what you expected when
you reported for work this morning 
is it  frank  no 
is that what passes
for wit in this circle 
in this circle  my friend   
wit is not a requirement of the job 
brutality  yes 
an ability to inflict pain 
absolutely 
a certain psychotic  moral ignorance 
blind obedience  all required 
but not wit 
how was it 
  fun 
  only the beginning  my love 
what s this all about 
a timely question  max 
pardon me 
hello 
put me on the speaker so you don t
have to repeat the instructions 
in the next two hours  you ll get
 5 million in non sequential  100 bills 
you put them in
a waterproof suitcase 
you go to the
bayfront park personally 
there will be a blue chrysler
parked on the sand 
you place the suitcase
in the trunk  and you leave 
i don t know if i can get
five million dollars in two hours 
mr  billings  please 
i read the newspapers 
the day you were appointed
to your current position   
your net worth exceeded
100 million dollars 
so  you won t even feel the bite 
what guarantee do i have
that you won t harm my son 
guarantee  mr  billings  huh 
i m not a car dealer 
don t let the charming accent   
and my grammatical 
impeccable syntax mislead you 
i live in the jungle 
and in the jungle   
you either eat or be eaten 
but in the spirit of doing business 
here is the guarantee 
ten minutes past the deadline  if the
money doesn t arrive  i send a finger 
twenty minutes  a hand 
thirty minutes  a foot

pretend it s someone else 
hi  susan 
uh  no  i m just here at home 
i didn t do it  audrey  she had
a gun on jack  i had no choice 
yeah  i saw that 
  what do you know 
  it s more than a kidnapping 
they called and asked for a ransom 
the doctors there were fake 
they were trying to give jack a shot   
when i interrupted them 
audrey  i promised jack
i wouldn t let anyone hurt him 
  i m not gonna break that promise 
  frank 
i ll call you back 
audrey 
is everything all right 
that s a pretty stupid question to
ask right now  don t you think  jeff 
all right  so tell me again 
inspector tarconi   
why you didn t immediately
identify yourself as a police officer 
oh  i was  uh  overwhelmed by the
effectiveness of your operation   
and the sophistication
of your equipment 
you know  i work in a small
office in small town 
we only have small crimes 
i must admit 
i was a little insecure 
and you and frank martin
are friends  right 
a friend  oh  i wouldn t say
exactly a friend 
i know him 
we have a relationship 
  a long relationship 
  not so long 
  but they found you cookin 
in his house    i m french 
  so 
  we don t need to know someone   
for a long time
in order to cook for them 
it s our way of breaking the ice 
take  for example  you 
this sandwich and coffee 
you will pardon me to think so 
but it s not very good 
yeah  i know  it sucks  but what
does that got to do with anything 
do you have a kitchen 
stay back  stay back 
don t move 
smith  drop it 
fuck 
aah 
i just found this 
oh  jesus 
  what happened 
  we ll take care of it for you 
  are you sure this is safe 
  look over your shoulder 
we got you covered 
as my mother used to say   
   a meal is only limited
by your imagination     hmm 
that s créme brulée
and croque monsieur 
  cream brulée 
  créme brulée 
  croque monsieur 
  croque monsieur 
  oui 
  where are you 
  cooking 
  cooking  can you talk 
  speak of the devil  my mother 
  mom 
please  um  do you mind 
thank you 
may i ask who you re cooking for 
for the u s  marshals 
but once they found my badge 
they were very polite 
they gave me coffee
and a sandwich 
you wouldn t believe what passes
for food in this place  frank 
but i m correcting the situation   
while they wait for my chief
to call back and confirm everything 
of course  that might take a while 
he s never there 
  anything about me    yes 
they are very interested about you 
they want to know where you are 
where are you 
nowhere for very long 
listen  hold on 
do you have access to a computer 
it s years since having access
to something decent 
oh  handsome fellow 
who is he 
that s what i need to know 
do they have an i d  program 
you ll forgive me 
but i m not so used to this system 
back home  there is
one computer for 10 of us 
so  how is it with you  frank 
it s a complicated story 
  you mean  you are in the shit 
  you might say that 
in other words 
you re not arrested 
ah  voilà  a russian biologist
with advanced degrees   
from the state laboratory for
biological warfare in siberia

  miami  park west 
king street  number 11

conducive to your good health   
which is all i needed to know
in the first place 
have a good life 
what s left of it 
outpost to base 
the ransom is still there 
thanks  the ransom still
hasn t been picked up 
what does that mean 
don t worry 
right now it means nothing 
what if it s not a kidnapping 
i ve worked with over 15
kidnapping cases in two years 
you think that if they don t take
the ransom  i m gonna get my son back 
audrey  don t make this any more
complicated than it already is 
i m not making this complicated 
jefferson  it s because of your job 
what does my job
have to do with any of this 
it has everything to do with it 
don t you understand  because you
became famous  we became the targets 
and no matter what
any of you all think   
the only one who s out there
trying to get jack back is frank 
frank  the chauffeur 
you spoke with frank martin
and didn t tell us about it 
what the hell are you
doing talking to him 
because he is the last
person who saw jack alive 
we found the boy 
it shut down
