you wouldn  t be
mr  andy webb 
would you 
that  s right 
my name is amanda child 
this here is travis child 
he  s my brother 
he looks kind of flat 
don  t he 
no  i mean this is
my brother right here 
that  s his name 
travis child 
i know  i know 
no offense 
what about it 
well  see 
my brother  s in town here
for a little
temporary business 
we  re on our way
to nashville for
a big engagement 
he  s got a record contract
waiting for him 
a big one 
how   bout
a sody pop 
it sounds like
this might get
a little windy 
oh  no  thanks 
well  i  m going
to have one 
strawberry 
might as well
have one 
looks good
having a good looking
lady customer and all 
well  okay 
anything to help you out 
see  i  m my brother s
manager 
mm hmm 
and i saw this place 
i thought maybe we could
help each other out 
that  d be nice 
folks helping folks 
right 
now  my brother  s
real anxious to get
to nashville 
but he always
listens to me 
and i told him
i thought it  d be nice
if he played here
for a week 
tuned up his act 
so to speak 
now  he said he would 
providing that
i could set up the deal 
well  now 
i don  t know about  
now wait a minute 
let me tell you
the best part 
when he starts blowing out
them songs of his 
i got to be real honest
with you  mister 
he knocks them folks
flat out of their minds 
you ain  t seen
nothing like it 
i mean  in a couple days 
when the word gets out
that he  s here 
you  re going to be
drawing in people
from all over georgia 
i haven  t even heard
anything like it 
it  s a sight to see 
well  now  say i was
to go for this deal  
and i got to admit
my curiosity is up 
how much
would it cost me 
for the week  i mean 
you are going
to love this 
just  300
for the whole week 
maybe a couple
extra bucks for
some backup boys 
but i  ll
scrounge them up myself 
300 plus 
unbelievable  isn  t it 
mm hmm 
sort of
a coincidence too 
oh  really  why 
well  that  s
the exact same amount
it  s going to cost
to get your brother
out of judge
wintergreen  s jail 
here  s for your old
strawberry soda 
now hold on there
just a minute 
little  un 
don  t go running off

i was afraid if i
tried to stop you 
you  d have
broke your tongue 
so    
well  now 
i can  t rightly go
for putting on
a show right now 
but i was
thinking i do need
some time off
to tend to some
other business 
and this is a slow
time of the year
around the club 
so i thought
maybe he could
tend bar for me 
give me
a little time off 
he ain  t no bartender 
he  s an artist 
i know that  honey 
it  s the best offer
i got 
oh  shit
