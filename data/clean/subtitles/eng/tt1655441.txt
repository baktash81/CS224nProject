1924  death of lenin

edisons newsreel
a trip down market street
san francisco ca 1906
adaline marie bowman was born
at 1201 am january 1st 1908
at childrens hospital san francisco
the only child of fay and milton bowman
on june 16th 1929
just as adaline bowman and her mother
stopped to admire the expense
with three years hence
construction would be finish
on the golden gate bridge
a young engineer displayed
uncommon gallantry
87 days later
adaline married clarence james prescott
at old st marys cathedral in san francisco
three years later
adaline gave birth to a baby girl
they named her flemming
after adalines paternal grandmother
on february 17th 1937
eight workers and two engineers
lost their lives
when a section of scaffolding
felt through a safety net
during construction of the golden gate bridge
among the deceased
was adalines husband
ten months after her husbands death
adaline was driving north
to her parents beach cottage
where 5 year old flemming
was waiting up for her
when something
highly unusual occurred
something almost magical
snow fell in sonoma county california
the emerge in the frigid water
caused  adalines body
to go to an anoxic reflex
instantly stopping her breathing
and slowing her heartbeat
within two minutes
adaline bowmans core temperature
had dropped to 87 fº 30º c degrees
her heart stopped beating
at 825
a bolt of lightning
struck the vehicle
discharging half a billion volts of electricity
and producing 60 000 amperes of current
its effect was threefault
first the charge defribillated
adaline bowmans heart
second
she was jilted of her anoxic state
causing her to draw
her first breath in two minutes
third
based on bon laymans principle of electron compression
and dioxide nucleic acid
which will be discovered in the year 2035
adaline bowman were henceforth
to be immune to the ravages of time
she will never age another day
as the years passed
adaline credited her unchanging
appearance to a combination of a healthy diet
exercise heredity and good luck
adaline

soon after adaline
moved back to san francisco
and took a clerical job
at the school of medicine

of every opportunity
to research her condition
after a year of intense study
adaline bowman was forced
to confront the fact
that there was absolutely
no scientific explanation for her condition

of the communist party
or have you ever been
a member of the communist party
adaline

and appearance every decade
and never to speak
a word of her fate
to another living soul
in seven weeks when
jennifer larson disappears forever

hello
hey jenny
alright you dont actually

oh be quiet
theres more here than meets the eye
this used to be one of those
popular picture houses in the city
a movie theater
yes
in the thirties a woman named
mary elizabeth woods
red about a chemical magnat
who would create a drivein theater
hum hum
in camden new jersey
and so naturally she needed
one of her own here in san francisco
everyone thought she was crazy
as a loon which she was
she would sleep with anyone
who wasnt her husband
and she used to put all this airs
like shes better than anyone else
anyway
because of local ordinances
she couldnt have an openair theater
so she brought all the cars in here
thats a spring right there
it was spectacular
i imagine
are you ready
for the best part
sure
ok look up
she had photoluminescent
filaments installed
they took the time
to create the constellations
isnt it beautiful
yeah
what are you doing
come on
cheers
the great paradox
of all this is that
the better our engines get
the further we can see
but now i see the future
its in the past
the events line has not
even reach us yet
i dont think ill ever understand
why so few people care about history
the future has its charms too
when can talk about ours

a couple of hundred billion
plato believe that
every soul has a companion star
he returns to after death
if you live tomorrow life
you believe that

im a scientist
plato was a philosopher
a poet
why did you name
your comet after my mother
if my calculations were correct
they turned out to be wrong
it would have been the
closest approach
to earth of any comet
in 200 hundred years
in other words
like your mother
a near miss

propose to her

the moon is responsible
for much of what takes place
on the surface of the earth
a stray meteor
hit the moon in 1178
the result in concussion
would cause
extreme tides on every lunar phase
in tierra del fuego argentina
a 23 per cent rise
in the mean tide on this night
produced a storm 200000 miles
of the pacific coast
causing an increase in the amount
of molecular ionization in the atmosphere
for the first time
in 78 years
snow fell
in this part of sonoma county
in the first stages
of hypothermia
the body will try
to generate heat
through shivering
when this fails
it will decrease
the flow of blood
to the extremities
metabolism
slows to a crawl
youre dying
but you dont know it
in the final stages
the victim breathes only
once or twice a minute
a state of suspended animation
jenny
at 707 pm
adaline bowmans
core temperature
had dropped to 87 degrees f 30º c
her heart
stopped beating
at last
at the age 107
adaline bowman was
by any definition
dead
at precisely 209 pm
paramedics placed two defibrillator paddles
on adaline bowmans chest
they counted the prescribed
five seconds before ministering
750 volts of electricity
how is she
weve just run a series of tests
and dont see any
long term damages
