 1924   death of lenin 
 1906 news by year
edison s newsreel 
 a trip down market street
san francisco ca 1906 
adaline marie bowman was born
at 12 01 am january 1st 1908
at children s hospital  san francisco 
the only child of fay and milton bowman 
on june 16th 1929 
just as adaline bowman and her mother
stopped to admire the expense
with three years  hence
construction would be finish
on the golden gate bridge 
a young engineer displayed
uncommon gallantry 
87 days later 
adaline married clarence james prescott
at old st  mary s cathedral in san francisco 
three years later 
adaline gave birth to a baby girl 
they named her flemming 
after adaline s paternal grandmother 
on february 17th 1937 
eight workers and two engineers
lost their lives
when a section of scaffolding
felt through a safety net 
during construction of the golden gate bridge 
among the deceased
was adaline s husband 
ten months after her husband s death
adaline was driving north
to her parents beach cottage 
where 5 year old flemming
was waiting up for her 
when something
highly unusual occurred 
something    almost magical 
snow fell in sonoma county california 
the emerge in the frigid water
caused  adaline s body
to go to an anoxic reflex 
instantly stopping her breathing
and slowing her heartbeat 
within two minutes
adaline bowman s core temperature
had dropped to 87 fº  30º c  degrees 
her heart stopped beating 
at 8 25 
a bolt of lightning
struck the vehicle
discharging half a billion volts of electricity
and producing 60 000 amperes of current 
it s effect was three fault 
first  the charge defribillated
adaline bowman s heart 
second 
she was jilted of her anoxic state
causing her to draw
her first breath in two minutes 
third 
based on bon layman s principle of electron compression
and dioxide nucleic acid 
which will be discovered in the year 2035 
adaline bowman were  henceforth 
to be immune to the ravages of time 
she will never age another day 
as the years passed 
adaline credited her unchanging
appearance to a combination of a healthy diet 
exercise  heredity and good luck 
adaline 
miriam  hello

and took a clerical job
at the school of medicine

of every opportunity
to research her condition 
after a year of intense study 
adaline bowman was forced
to confront the fact
that there was absolutely
no scientific explanation for her condition

of the communist party 
or have you ever been
a member of the communist party

changing her name  residence
and appearance every decade
and never to speak
a word of her fate
to another living soul

into the hills  leaving their boats behind 
hundreds of boats were left on shore 
downtown san francisco

now    city services
found this
when they were digging
for utility line 
oh  my god

i was a math major in college 
and  in my spare time 
i developed an algorithm
for analyzing climate data 
but my roommate figured out that it could
also be used for economic forecasts

sold it three years later and then
with his half he retired to fiji 
and with my half i m   
i m doing this 
your job is
scaring away money

where you re taking him 
someplace he s never been before 
  hello 
  hey  jenny 
alright  you don t actually
think is my first chop chop date 
oh  be quiet 
there s more here than meets the eye 
this used to be one of those
popular picture houses in the city 
  a movie theater 
  yes 
in the thirties  a woman named
mary elizabeth woods
red about a chemical magnat
who would create a drive in theater
  hum hum
  in camden  new jersey 
and so naturally  she needed
one of her own  here in san francisco 
everyone thought she was crazy
as a loon  which she was 
she would sleep with anyone
who wasn t her husband 
and she used to put all this airs
like she s better than anyone else 
anyway   
because of local ordinances 
she couldn t have an open air theater 
so she brought all the cars in here 
that s a spring right there 
it was spectacular   
i imagine 
are you ready
for the best part 
  sure
  ok  look up 
she had photoluminescent
filaments installed 
they took the time
to create the constellations 
isn t it beautiful 
yeah 
what are you doing 
come on 
cheers 
the great paradox
of all this is that   
the better our engines get
the further we can see 
but now i see the future 
it s in the past 
the event s line has not
even reach us yet 
i don t think i ll ever understand
why so few people care about history 
the future has its charms too 
when can talk about ours 
  ellis   
  not the distant future   
 i m talking about this weekend

of hours from here

i was at second year in med school so   
so  i was like    26 
i was thinking about
quitting medicine  bored 
but i was     i was afraid 
i was too old to start over 
i told her   
i told adaline about it
and she just laughed in my face 
she said   go for it  
don t be silly 
 life s too short  
if it wasn t for her i probably wouldn t
have found  astronomy and physics
she was only a couple of years older
than i was but she was so wise 
she was so   
sophisticated 
she hum

this is funny 
what do you mean 
what did i do 
you were very close 
you were very close 
you said that two twice now 
and you should see your face
when you talk about her 
are you gonna wax nostalgic
this whole weekend 
look  it s just that that   
she looks so much like
her mother that i m remembering things
that i even didn t
know i remembered

the idea is to get
enough of these little   
  wedges 
  pie 
  they re cheese 
they re wedges  you get
enough of them to fill up
your circle and you win  ok 
most of the questions
are about a stupid stuff 
hence the word  trivia  
yeah  like  here s
an example for you   
hum    on june 22nd 1938
this american boxer
retained his heavy weight
championship when he beat
max schmeling in the 1st round
  well  that it is in top four 
  ah  yeah

what would happen first 
dad loses in trivial pursuit
or della finally appears 
della 
yeah  you remember the comet
i told you about 
the one that my dad
my dad discovered   
he named it della c 1981 
after my great aunt  adèle 
  ok  let s go

how many stars do you think
there are in our galaxy 
i don t know

a couple of hundred billion 
plato believe that   
every soul has a companion star
he returns to after death 
if you live tomorrow life 
you believe that 
no  no  i m a   
i m a scientist 
plato was a philosopher 
a poet 
why did you name
your comet after my mother 
if my calculations were correct 
they turned out to be wrong    
it would have been the   
closest approach   
to earth of any comet
in 200 hundred years 
in other words   
like your mother 
a near miss 
what does that mean 
i was gonna
propose to her 
i had an engagement ring in my pocket 
she stood me up 
near miss

dead 
at precisely 2 09 p m 
paramedics placed two defibrillator paddles
on adaline bowman s chest 
they counted the prescribed
five seconds before ministering
