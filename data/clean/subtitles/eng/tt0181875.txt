time is near
time for toys
and time for cheer
we ve been good
but we can t last
hurry  christmas
hurry fast
want a plane
that loops the loop

we can hardly
stand the wait
please  christmas
don t be late
you wanna be atticus finch  good 
  i like him 
  why 
  he s honest 
  yes 
  he stands up for the right thing 
  yes 
  and he s a good father 
  he is 
  did it all by himself 
  did what all by himself 
  raised his kids 
  he didn t raise them by himself  
who was the woman that
came to their house every day 
  calpurnia 
  calpurnia  he remembered 
  and what about boo 
  what about boo 
boo radley is the most interesting
character in to kill a mockingbird 
boo radley is the most interesting
character in to kill a mockingbird 
mom  tell me more about livia 
she killed everybody so her son tiberius
could inherit the throne   like nixon 
it s awfully common 
the same stories  the shakespeare  like
those plays we saw at the old globe 
  anita 
  hey  mom 
  want something to eat 
  no  thanks  i already ate 
  are you sure  i made soy cutlets 
  i m fine  i already ate 
wait 
you ve been kissing 
  no  i haven t 
  yes  you have 
  i can tell 
  you can t tell 
not only can i tell 
i know who it is  it s darryl 
what you got
under your coat 
it s un fair that we can t
listen to our music 
it s because it is about drugs
and promiscuous sex 
simon and garfunkel is poetry 
it is the poetry
of drugs and promiscuous sex 
honey  they re on pot 
first  it was butter 
then it was sugar and white flour 
bacon  eggs  bologna 
rock  n  roll  motorcycles 
then  it was celebrating christmas
on a day in september   
when you knew it
wouldn t be commercialized 
  what else are you gonna ban 
  you want to rebel against knowledge 
i m trying to give you the cliff s notes
on how to live life in this world 
we re like nobody else i know 
i am a college professor 
why can t i teach my own kids  use me 
darryl says that you
use knowledge to keep me down 
he says i m a   yes   person   
and you are trying to raise us
in a    no   environment 
well  clearly    no   is a word
darryl doesn t hear much 
i can t live here  i hate you 
  even william hates you 
  i don t hate her 
you do hate her 
you don t even know the truth 
  don t be a drama queen 
  feck you 
this is a house of lies 
there it is 
  your sister used the   f   word 
  i think she said   feck   
  what s the difference 
  the letter    u   
i look so much younger
than everyone else 
enjoy it while you can 
mom  it s time 
  can this wait till we get home 
  mom  pull over 
tell him the truth 
tell him how old he is 
he knows how old he is 
but other kids make fun of him
because of how young he looks 
nobody includes him  they call him
  the narc   behind his back 
  they do 
  what s a narc 
  a narcotics officer 
  well  what s wrong with that 
come on  you guys 
it s no big deal 
i m twelve 
she skipped me a grade 
big deal 
i m a year younger 
they re 1 3  i m 1 2 
aren t i  
i also put you in first grade when
you were five  and i never told you 
so i m how old 
you re 11  
  eleven 
  so you skipped fifth grade 
 there s too much padding in the grades 
 eleven 
this explains    so much 
you ve robbed him
of an adolescence 
adolescence is a marketing tool 
honey  i know you were
expecting puberty   
but you re just gonna have to
shine it on for a little while 
who needs a crowd 
who put such a high premium
on being typical 
you re unique  take those extra years
and do what you want 
go to europe for a year 
take a look around 
see what you like 
follow your dream 
you ll still be
the youngest lawyer in the country 
your dad was so proud of you 
he knew you were an accelerated child 
what about me 
you are rebellious
and ungrateful of my love 
this song explains why i m leaving home
to become a stewardess 
we can t talk 
we have to listen to rock music 
i love you 
let us be lovers
we ll marry our fortunes together
i ve got some real estate
here in my bag
hey  man  take good care
of her in san francisco  man 
and walked off
to look for america
one day    you ll be cool 
look under your bed 
it ll set you free 
michigan seems
like a dream to me now
watch the plant 
you re 1 8 and i can t stop you 
i ve gone to look for america
bye 
she ll be back 
maybe not soon 
i said  be careful
his bow tie
is really a camera
toss me a cigarette
i think there  s one in my raincoat
we smoked the last one an hour ago
so i looked at the scenery
she read her magazine
and the moon rose
over an open field
here  s a theory
for you to disregard   
completely 
music  you know  
true music  
not just rock  n  roll  
it chooses you 
it lives in your car  or alone 
listening to your headphones  
you know  with the vast  scenic bridges
and angelic choirs in your brain 
it s a place apart   
from the vast  benign   
lap of america 
it s quite an honor to have
the world s greatest rock critic   
and editor of creem magazine   
back home in san diego
for a few days 
  lester bangs 
  the doors  jim morrison 
he s a drunken buffoon
posing as a poet 
  i like the doors 
  give me the guess who 
they got the courage to be drunken
buffoons  which makes them poetic 
give me some
  white light white heat   
iggy pop 
amen 
put this on 
this isn t on your play list either 
  isn t it a bit early for that 
  not for me 
that was lester bangs  this is
alice wisdom  and here is iggy pop 
so you re the kid who s sent me those
articles from the school newspaper 
yeah  yeah 
i ve been doing some stuff for
a local underground paper also 
  what are you  the star of your school 
  they hate me 
you ll meet them all again
on their long journey to the middle 
your writing is damn good  it s just
a shame you missed out on rock  n  roll 
  it s over 
  over 
it s over  you got here
just in time for the death rattle 
last gasp 
last grope 
  at least i m here for that 
  what do you type on 
smith corona galaxies deluxe 
  and you like lou reed 
  the early stuff 
i n his new stuff 
he s trying to be bowie 
he should just be himself 
  you take drugs 
  no 
smart kid 
i used to do speed 
you know  and sometimes
a little cough syrup 
i d stay up all night 
just writing and writing 
i mean 
like 25 pages of dribble  
you know  about the faces 
or coltrane 
you know  just to fucking write 
all right 
it s been nice to meet ya 
keep sending me your stuff 
i can t stand here all day
talking to my many fans 
i understand 
you know  because once you go to l a  
you re gonna have friends like crazy 
but they re gonna be fake friends 
they re gonna try to corrupt you 
you got an honest face 
and they re gonna tell you everything 
but you cannot make friends
with the rock stars 
  is it okay if i  
  if you re gonna be a true journalist  
you know  a rock journalist  
first  you never get paid much 
but you will get free records
from the record company 
jesus 
fucking nothing about you
that is controversial  man 
god  it s gonna get ugly  man 
they re gonna buy you drinks 
you re gonna meet girls  they re gonna
fly you places for free  offer drugs 
i know it sounds great 
but these people are not your friends 
these are people who want you
to write sanctimonious stories   
about the genius of rock stars 
and they will ruin rock  n  roll 
and strangle   
everything we love
about it  right 
and then it just becomes
an industry of cool 
i m telling you  you re coming along at
a very dangerous time for rock  n  roll 
that s why i think you should turn 
go back  and be a lawyer or something 
but i can tell from your face
that you won t 
i can give you 35 bucks 
  give me 1  000 words on black sabbath 
  an assignment 
you have to make your reputation
on being honest   
and   
you know  unmerciful 
honest 
unmerciful 
if you get into a jam 
you can call me 
i stay up late 
look at this 
look at this 
an entire generation of cinderellas 
and there s no slipper coming 
you want to get high 
looking to get high 
all i have to do is listen 
  that s what lester bangs said 
  as long as i know this is a hobby 
i ll pick you up right here
at  11 00 sharp 
if you get lost 
use the family whistle 
  good luck 
  thanks 
don t take drugs 
yes  mother

they wanna be near someone famous 
we re here because of the music 
we are band aids 
 she used to run a school for band aids 
 we don t have intercourse with them 
we inspire the music 
we re here because of the music 
she was the one
who changed everything 
she was the one who said 
   no more sex 
no more exploiting
our bodies and our hearts   
  right 
 just blowjobs  that s it 
  it s all happening 
  it s all happening 
here comes sabbath 
ozzy osbourne

i think i saw sapphire in there 
does anybody remember laughter 
sapphire 
  come on

oh  the enemy 
a rock writer 
right  i d like to interview you

we play for the fans 
not the critics 
russell  jeff   
ed  larry 
i really love your band 
i think the song    fever dog  
is a big step forward for you 
and you guys producing it yourselves
instead of glyn johns   
that was the right thing to do 
and russell  russell 
the guitar sound

in incendiary 
way to go 
hey  man

take a straight and stronger course
to the corner of your life
hey  red dog 
hey hey 
good to see you  man 
some people have a hard time
explaining rock  n  roll 
i don t think anyone can
really explain rock  n  roll 
maybe pete townshend 
but that s okay 
rock  n  roll is a lifestyle
and a way of thinking   
and it s not about money
and popularity 
although some money would be nice 
but it s a voice that says 
   here i am   
and fuck you
if you can t understand me   
and one of these people
is gonna save the world 
and that means that rock  n  roll
can save the world   
all of us together 
and the chicks are great  but what
it all comes down to is that thing 
the indefinable thing when people
catch something from your music 
what i m talking about is  
wait  what am i talking about 
  the buzz 
  the buzz 
and the chicks  the whatever   
is an offs hoot of the buzz

found you a pass

he s a fan

he looks harmless  but he does represent
the magazine that trashed    layla     
broke up cream  ripped every album
led zeppelin ever made 
don t forget the rules  man 
this little shit is the enemy 
he writes what he sees 
if i don t get into a room

you are going to get me
in so much trouble

and some of the people
that you meet on the road   
are really amazing people 
like you 
but some of the stuff that happens 
it s good for   
a few people to know about 
as opposed to  say   
a million people 
  understand what i m trying to say 
  yeah 
see  i grew up with these guys 
but i can t play all that i can play 
i m past  em 
as musicians  but   
the more popular we get 
the bigger their houses get   
the more responsibilities 
the pressure  you know  
the harder it gets
for me to walk out on them 
what am i doing 
i m telling secrets to the one guy

what about graduation 
we had an agreement  william 
i m sorry i didn t

i guess i just miss you 
and i don t understand   
why i ve driven my two kids
so far away from me 
by all practical rules 
don t i get you for another three years 
was i not fun 
yes 
this is beth from denver 
she s one of the legendary 
original band aids 
  she s clairvoyant 
  i can t read your mind or anything 
i mean  i pick up things
here and there 
estrella says hi 
  she says i can stay in your room 
  sure 
great  i ve got some   
hydroponic pot 
wow  your aura
is really fantastic 
  it s this beautiful purple color 
  i love you 
i missed the last thing you said 
  your aura is purple 
  i love you 
  what 
  purple  it s purple 
  mom  what 
  your aura is purple 
i miss you and i love you 
i love you 
all right 
fire away  i m ready 
do you have to be depressed
to write a sad song 
do you have to be in love
to write a love song 
is the song better
if it really happened to you 
like    love thing    where did you
write that  who is it about 
when did you get
so professional 
gentlemen  your first
t shirts have arrived 
it s the record company s mistake 
and they will pay 
t shirts are gone 
band happy  all right 
can we just skip the vibe  and go
straight to us laughing about this 
yeah  okay 
because i can see by your face
you want to get into it 
how can you tell 
i m just one of the out of focus guys 
here  take it 
let s take a good look at it 
all right 
see  you love this t shirt 
it lets you say
everything you want to say 
well  it speaks
pretty loudly to me 
it s a t shirt 
do you give a shit
about a t shirt 
i m just hungry  man  let s just go out
and find some barbecue or something 
i m always gonna
tell you the truth 
from the very beginning 
we said i m the front man   
and you re the guitarist
with mystique 
that s the dynamic we agreed on 
page  plant  mick  keith  
but somehow it s all turning around 
we have got to control
what s happening 
  there s a responsibility here 
  excuse me 
didn t we all get into this
to avoid responsibility 
i can t say any more
with the writer here 
you can trust him 
say what you want 
he won t write it 
i work as hard  or harder 
than anybody on that stage 
you know what i do 
i connect 
i get people off  
i look for the one guy
who isn t getting off   
and i make him get off 
actually  that you can print 
and yet  why do i always end up
feeling like i m a joke to you 
you want to pretend this isn t
gonna be a very big band  well  it is 
you call yourself
a leader of this band   
but your direction
allowed this t shirt   
when you allowed dick
to manage us 
 cause he s your friend 
don t you see  man 
the t shirt is everything 
is it my turn now 
because i think we should  for once 
say what we really mean 
  this is the part where you quit 
  right  i m so predictable 
deal with it 
and let me say
what nobody else wants to say 
  what 
  your looks have become a problem 
all right  enough 
break it up 
everyone out of the room
for five minutes 
hey  yeah 
william  sorry 
come on  man  come on 
let s go find something real 
from here on out  i m only interested
in what is real

  thanks 
  you know

my dad died of a heart attack   
and my sister believes
that my mom is so intense   
that she had to escape our family   
and they can t seem to find
a way to get through it 
i mean  they don t even speak
to each other anymore 
plus  she gave me all her albums 
and now she s a stewardess

you had a busy day today
in carl jung s opinion   
we all have a sixth sense  
intuition 
when you meet someone and you suddenly
feel like you can t live without them

from the collective unconscious 
or  it could just be hormones

he  s a smart  good hearted
15 year old kid   
with infinite potential 
this is not some apron wearing mother

he s not ready for your world
of compromised values   
and diminished brain cells
that you throw away like confetti 
am i speaking to you clearly 
  yes  ma am 
  if you break his spirit   
harm him in any way   
keep him from his chosen profession 
which is law   
something you may not value 
but i do   
you will meet the voice
at the other end of this telephone 
and it will not be pretty 
do we understand each other 
  uh  yes  ma am 
  i didn t ask for this role   
but i ll play it 
now go do your best 
   be bold and mighty forces
will come to your aid   
goethe said that 
it s not too late for you to become
a person of substance  russell 
please get my son home safely 
you know  i m glad we spoke 
song and pong
it sounds like lots of fun
won t you get on my back
for piggyback ride
get on my back
for piggyback ride
  all right  boys 
  all right 
your mom kind of freaked me out 
she means well 
from troy  michigan   
would you please welcome
to cleveland   
stillwater 
father  father
tell me the story
tell me what to do
doctor  doctor
is there a cure
for the young man s broken blues
and he said
everybody knows
yeah  you had to be there
girl  you had to be there
did you see that chick s shirt
in front of russell 
when you play a great show
like tonight  
okay  i need everyone s attention 
please 
girls  i need five minutes
with the band alone 
right 
well  it seems the rumors are true 
the record company has sent
a big time manager here   
to try and talk you
into replacing me 
his name is dennis hope 
i know you ve all heard of him 
he s got all the big bands 
and he s outside right now   
and he wants five minutes with you 
and  well  i think
we ve gotta do this 
  well  send him in 
  yeah  bring him in 
  we ll send him out on a rail 
  all right 
we ll finish the interview in maryland 
you can fly home from maryland  okay 
hey  we ve already got a manager 
he s been with us from the beginning 
respectfully 
we all have our roots 
i believe in bands
holding on to their roots 
those roots need to be augmented 
your manager here
needs a manager 
example   if you hadn t have run out
on your contract in phoenix   
we could have sued
over russell s hand 
but you left  negating the contract 
forfeiting the deposit 
you effectively traveled a long way
to pay that promoter to electrocute you 
okay  your damages have put you
way in the hole for this tour 
right now  you owe the record company
more than you ve got 
but your record s selling 
there s money to be made 
so i brought a plane in  we could add
more shows to make up the difference 
  respectfully 
  we travel by bus 
doris is the soul of this band 
that bus has been our home since
we were the jeff bebe band  no way 
hey  man  i d travel on a pogo stick
if i thought we could make more money 
you could play more dates
with a plane 
well  it s not about money  it s about
playing music and turning people on 
clearly  respectfully 
why should we pay you for something
we can do ourselves 
do you know how to keep
from getting charged   
for the ice below the floorboards
at chicago stadium 
do you know how to do
a headlining tour 
do you know how to get a record
not pressed  but played 
you gotta take what you can 
when you can  while you can   
and you gotta do it now 
that s what the big boys do 
because if you think mick jagger ll
still be out there   
trying to be a rock star at age 50 
you re sadly  sadly mistaken 
i didn t invent the rainy day  man 
i just own the best umbrella 
i m telling you  you re coming along at
a very dangerous time for rock and roll 
the war is over 
they won   
and they will ruin rock and roll   
and strangle everything
we love about it 
put  em up 
all right  money down 
one guy says     i ll draw a picture
and you guess what it is  all right   
  can i help you 
  is russell hammond here 
hey  the enemy 
come on in  son

this is the circus 
everybody s trying not to go home 
  nobody s saying good bye 
  would you like some 
  i may 
  how many 
  quit looking at me like that 
  you think you can fool me 
i can read you 
i know what you re thinking 
  what s that 
  you re worried about me and russell 
yeah  i gotta work on that 
you re so sweet 
god  if there was more of you in him 
don t tell me this stuff 
i wanna like him 
did you miss your test or something 
  you have no idea 
  look  i know i m not on the plane 
i m not going
on some other band s bus 
i could go with the stillwater road crew
but that would be pathetic   
and the girls are all going
with humble pie 
so  if you could find out
from russell  
forget it 
i m flying to new york myself 
i ve got a bunch of partial tickets 
i know his ex wife   
current girlfriend thing
is gonna be there 
i m not sure that s a good idea 
what are you saying 
did russell say something 
  i don t know anything 
  well  i know he wants me there 
wake up 
don t go to new york 
  why are you yelling at me 
  i thought we were going to morocco 
there is no morocco 
there s never been a morocco 
there s not even a penny lane 
i don t even know
your real name 
if i ever met a man
in the real world   
who looked at me
the way you just looked at me  
when and where
does this    real world   occur 
i mean  i am really confused here 
all these rules   
and all these sayings and nicknames 
honey  you re too sweet
for rock and roll 
sweet  where do you get off 
where do you get sweet 
i am dark and mysterious
and pissed off  
and i could be very dangerous
to all of you 
i am not sweet 
and you should know that about me 
i am the enemy 
look  you should be happy for me 
you don t know
what he says to me in private 
maybe it is love 
as much as it can be for somebody  
who sold you to humble pie
for 50 bucks and a case of beer 
i was there 
i was there 
oh  god 
i m sorry 
what kind of beer 
welcome to new york 
it s okay to be nervous 
you should be nervous 
all you can do is be yourself   
and leave a pint of blood
on that stage

write what you want 
you re william miller 
  yep 
  oh  baby 
didn t anything happen  i mean 
after  600 in room service bills 
didn t you get anything on tape
with russell hammond 
and where were you in this piece 
what did you wanna write 
because this reads
like what they wanted you to write 
you obviously saw more
than you wrote about 
  something must have happened 
  let s push up flippo s who cover 
good   cause it s gonna take me
three days to get through this research 
it s all handwritten
on little bits of paper 
  it s a puff piece 
  they refer to the women as   chicks   
 as a woman  i have a problem with that 
 you want  em to like you 
  i know it s a side issue 
  it happens 
  it s embarrassing 
  ben  you told me to send what i had 
it s not finished 
give me tonight to work on it 
oh  man  you made friends with  em 
see  friendship is the booze
they feed you   
 cause they want you to get drunk
and feel like you belong 
well  it was fun 
because they make you feel cool 
  and  hey  i met you  you are not cool 
  i know 
even when i thought i was 
i knew i wasn t 
because we are uncool 
while women will always be
a problem for guys like us   
most of the great art in the world
is about that very problem 
good looking people  
they got no spine 
their art never lasts 
they get the girls 
but we re smarter 
  yeah  i can really see that now 
  yeah   cause great artist about   
you know  guilt and longing   
and  you know 
love disguised as sex   
and sex disguised as love 
hey  let s face it 
you got a big head start 
i m glad you were home 
i m always home 
i m uncool 
  me too 
  you re doing great  you know 
the only true currency
in this bankrupt world   
is what you share with someone else
when you re uncool 
listen  my advice to you  
and i know you think
these guys are your friends  
if you wanna be a true friend to them   
be honest and unmerciful 
   i m flying high
over tupelo  mississippi   
with america s hottest band   
and we re all about to die   
  dark  lively 
  yeah  yeah  and it gets better 
  did this all really happen 
  i ll call and check the quotes 
holy shit  i just got off the phone
with rolling stone 
they called me too 
what s he using 
all   he s using it all 
this  according to the   fact checker   
so what 
  so what    
we come off like amateurs   
some average band trying to come
to grips with success   
jealous and fighting
and breaking up 
we re buffoons 
   rock and roll can save the world    
  the chicks are great    
i sound like a dick 
  you are a dick 
  i never said that 
maybe we just don t see ourselves
the way we really are 
is it that hard
to make us look cool 
this kid has you on acid screaming 
   i m a golden god   from a fan s rooftop 
they used him to fuck us  they ll
probably just put you on the cover 
wait  i never said 
   i m a golden god   
or did i  
he was never a person 
he was a journalist 
it s phenomenal  william 
to be quite honest with you 
it s sophisticated  intelligent  we
only had to cut out a couple of grafs 
jeff bebe s mother already sent over a
whole shoe box full of childhood photos 
  she did 
  but it s really gonna look fantastic 
the band just denied 90 percent
of the story  it s a fabrication 
you weren t honest 
and worse  you wasted our time 
did you talk to russell hammond 
russell hammond is the one
who denied it 
  now wait a second 
  denied it 
we re going with the who 
manuscript s in my office 
he s just some fan 
what do you expect 
so  anyway  put those two pieces  
wait 
you guys  this is my brother 
  nice to finally meet you 
  you have a good day 
you guys  i ll deadhead back later 
i think i m needed 
i ll see you 
you look awful  but it s great 
you re living your life 
you re free of mom 
hey  i ll take off work 
let s have an adventure together  
you and me   finally 
anywhere you wanna go 
anywhere in the world 
this is not my idea of a good time 
 just get me to my bed 
  i ll deal with her 
i forgive you 
i didn t apologize 
i am out of here 
  hey  sapphire 
  hey  boy 
  i hate good byes 
  me too 
is penny okay 
the quaaludes incident 
well  it wasn t pretty 
she could ve died 
you know  i always told her not to let
too many guys fall in love with her 
i guess i was wrong 
one of them ended up saving her life 
what do you care  i mean 
we all know what you did to him 
i mean  everybody knows 
even penny lane 
how you doing 
can you believe these new girls 
none of them use birth control 
and they eat all the steak 
i mean  they don t even know
what it is to be a fan 
you know  to truly love some silly
little piece of music  or some band   
so much that it hurts 
it s russell 
don t hang up 
i can t really talk right now 
i m in a room full of people 
actually  i m alone 
i won t call again  i promise 
but i need to see you face to face   
because i m never as good
as when you re there   
and i can see myself
the way you look at me 
and i m sorry  if we could just get
together and find some time to talk 
let s say all the things
we never said 
give me your address 
i m coming to you   
this time 
got a pen 
i m russell hammond 
so this is the famous russell hammond 
come in 
  is she home 
  who  anita 
  where am i  
  hello 
you know  when we spoke 
i felt that we connected 
oh  man 
my son is very important to me too   
and i do think you owe him
an apology 
  i appreciate you showing up 
  no  no  i agree   
ma am 
there s hope for you yet  russell 
well  
so this is   
where the enemy sleeps 
you know  i think we both wanted to  
to be with her 
and she wanted us to be together 
you should give her a call 
you both live in the same city 
  you really think i should 
  yeah 
that girl really cares about you 
man  i never even knew her real name 
oh  i called your magazine   
and told them the truth 
i don t know
what they re gonna do with it   
but i told them
every word you wrote was true 
we are gonna do this one more time 
so  russell   
what do you love about music
