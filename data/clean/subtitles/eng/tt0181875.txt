and time for cheer

but we cant last
hurry christmas

that loops the loop

we can hardly
stand the wait
please christmas
dont be late
you wanna be atticus finch good
i like him
why
hes honest
yes
he stands up for the right thing
yes
and hes a good father
he is
did it all by himself
did what all by himself
raised his kids
he didnt raise them by himself
who was the woman that
came to their house every day
calpurnia
calpurnia he remembered
and what about boo
what about boo
boo radley is the most interesting
character in to kill a mockingbird
boo radley is the most interesting
character in to kill a mockingbird
mom tell me more about livia
she killed everybody so her son tiberius
could inherit the throne like nixon
its awfully common
the same stories the shakespeare like
those plays we saw at the old globe
anita
hey mom
want something to eat
no thanks i already ate
are you sure i made soy cutlets
im fine i already ate
wait
youve been kissing
no i havent
yes you have
i can tell
you cant tell
not only can i tell
i know who it is its darryl
what you got
under your coat
its un fair that we cant
listen to our music
its because it is about drugs
and promiscuous sex
simon and garfunkel is poetry
it is the poetry
of drugs and promiscuous sex
honey theyre on pot
first it was butter
then it was sugar and white flour
bacon eggs bologna
rock n roll motorcycles
then it was celebrating christmas
on a day in september
when you knew it
wouldnt be commercialized
what else are you gonna ban
you want to rebel against knowledge
im trying to give you the cliffs notes
on how to live life in this world
were like nobody else i know
i am a college professor
why cant i teach my own kids use me
darryl says that you
use knowledge to keep me down
he says im a yes person
and you are trying to raise us
in a  no environment
well clearly  no is a word
darryl doesnt hear much
i cant live here i hate you
even william hates you
i dont hate her
you do hate her
you dont even know the truth
dont be a drama queen
feck you
this is a house of lies
there it is
your sister used the f word
i think she said feck
whats the difference
the letter  u
i look so much younger
than everyone else
enjoy it while you can
mom its time
can this wait till we get home
mom pull over
tell him the truth
tell him how old he is
he knows how old he is
but other kids make fun of him
because of how young he looks
nobody includes him they call him
the narc behind his back
they do
whats a narc
a narcotics officer
well whats wrong with that
come on you guys
its no big deal
im twelve
she skipped me a grade
big deal
im a year younger
theyre 1 3 im 1 2
arent i
i also put you in first grade when
you were five and i never told you
so im how old
youre 11
eleven
so you skipped fifth grade
theres too much padding in the grades
eleven
this explains so much
youve robbed him
of an adolescence
adolescence is a marketing tool
honey i know you were
expecting puberty
but youre just gonna have to
shine it on for a little while
who needs a crowd
who put such a high premium
on being typical
youre unique take those extra years
and do what you want
go to europe for a year
take a look around
see what you like
follow your dream
youll still be
the youngest lawyer in the country
your dad was so proud of you
he knew you were an accelerated child
what about me
you are rebellious
and ungrateful of my love
this song explains why im leaving home
to become a stewardess
we cant talk
we have to listen to rock music
i love you
let us be lovers
well marry our fortunes together
ive got some realestate
here in my bag
hey man take good care
of her in san francisco man
and walked off
to look for america
one day youll be cool
look under your bed
itll set you free
michigan seems
like a dream to me now
watch the plant
youre 1 8 and i cant stop you
ive gone to look for america
bye
shell be back
maybe not soon
i said be careful
his bow tie
is really a camera
toss me a cigarette
i think there s one in my raincoat
we smoked the last one an hour ago
so i looked at the scenery
she read her magazine
and the moon rose
over an open field
here s a theory
for you to disregard
completely
music you know
true music
not just rock n roll
it chooses you
it lives in your car or alone
listening to your headphones
you know with the vast scenic bridges
and angelic choirs in your brain
its a place apart
from the vast benign
lap of america
its quite an honor to have
the worlds greatest rock critic
and editor of creem magazine
back home in san diego
for a few days
lester bangs
the doors jim morrison
hes a drunken buffoon
posing as a poet
i like the doors
give me the guess who
they got the courage to be drunken
buffoons which makes them poetic
give me some
white lightwhite heat
iggy pop
amen
put this on
this isnt on your play list either
isnt it a bit early for that
not for me
that was lester bangs this is
alice wisdom and here is iggy pop
so youre the kid whos sent me those
articles from the school newspaper
yeah yeah
ive been doing some stuff for
a local underground paper also
what are you the star of your school
they hate me
youll meet them all again
on their long journey to the middle
your writing is damn good its just
a shame you missed out on rock n roll
its over
over
its over you got here
just in time for the death rattle
last gasp
last grope
at least im here for that
what do you type on
smithcorona galaxies deluxe
and you like lou reed
the early stuff
i n his new stuff
hes trying to be bowie
he should just be himself
you take drugs
no
smart kid
i used to do speed
you know and sometimes
a little cough syrup
id stay up all night
just writing and writing
i mean
like 25 pages of dribble
you know about the faces
or coltrane
you know just to fucking write
all right
its been nice to meet ya
keep sending me your stuff
i cant stand here all day
talking to my many fans
i understand
you know because once you go to la
youre gonna have friends like crazy
but theyre gonna be fake friends
theyre gonna try to corrupt you
you got an honest face
and theyre gonna tell you everything
but you cannot make friends
with the rock stars
is it okay if i
if youre gonna be a true journalist
you know a rock journalist
first you never get paid much
but you will get free records
from the record company
jesus
fucking nothing about you
that is controversial man
god its gonna get ugly man
theyre gonna buy you drinks
youre gonna meet girls theyre gonna
fly you places for free offer drugs
i know it sounds great
but these people are not your friends
these are people who want you
to write sanctimonious stories
about the genius of rock stars
and they will ruin rock n roll
and strangle
everything we love
about it right
and then it just becomes
an industry of cool
im telling you youre coming along at
a very dangerous time for rock n roll
thats why i think you should turn
go back and be a lawyer or something
but i can tell from your face
that you wont
i can give you 35 bucks
give me 1 000 words on black sabbath
an assignment
you have to make your reputation
on being honest
and
you know unmerciful
honest
unmerciful
if you get into a jam
you can call me
i stay up late
look at this
look at this
an entire generation of cinderellas
and theres no slipper coming
you want to get high
looking to get high
all i have to do is listen
thats what lester bangs said
as long as i know this is a hobby
ill pick you up right here
at  1100 sharp
if you get lost
use the family whistle
good luck

some people have a hard time
explaining rock n roll
i dont think anyone can
really explain rock n roll

rock n roll is a lifestyle

and its not about money
and popularity
although some money would be nice
but its a voice that says
here i am
and fuck you
if you cant understand me
and one of these people
is gonna save the world
and that means that rock n roll
can save the world
all of us together

it all comes down to is that thing
the indefinable thing when people
catch something from your music

some of us
we got girlfriends
back home you know
some of us have wives
and some of the people
that you meet on the road
are really amazing people

its good for
a few people to know about
as opposed to say
a million people
understand what im trying to say
yeah
see i grew up with these guys
but i cant play all that i can play
im past em
as musicians but
the more popular we get
the bigger their houses get
the more responsibilities
the pressure you know
the harder it gets
for me to walk out on them

band happy all right
can we just skip the vibe and go
straight to us laughing about this
yeah okay
because i can see by your face
you want to get into it
how can you tell
im just one of the outoffocus guys
here take it
lets take a good look at it
all right
see you love this tshirt
it lets you say
everything you want to say
well it speaks
pretty loudly to me
its a tshirt
do you give a shit
about a tshirt
im just hungry man lets just go out
and find some barbecue or something
im always gonna
tell you the truth
from the very beginning
we said im the front man
and youre the guitarist
with mystique
thats the dynamic we agreed on
page plant mick keith
but somehow its all turning around
we have got to control
whats happening
theres a responsibility here
excuse me
didnt we all get into this
to avoid responsibility
i cant say any more
with the writer here
you can trust him
say what you want
he wont write it
i work as hard or harder
than anybody on that stage
you know what i do
i connect
i get people off
i look for the one guy
who isnt getting off
and i make him get off
actually that you can print
and yet why do i always end up
feeling like im a joke to you
you want to pretend this isnt
gonna be a very big band well it is
you call yourself
a leader of this band
but your direction
allowed this tshirt
when you allowed dick
to manage us
cause hes your friend
dont you see man
the tshirt is everything
is it my turn now
because i think we should for once
say what we really mean
this is the part where you quit
right im so predictable
deal with it
and let me say
what nobody else wants to say
what
your looks have become a problem
all right enough
break it up
everyone out of the room
for five minutes
hey yeah

goethe said that
its not too late for you to become
a person of substance russell
please get my son home safely
you know im glad we spoke
song and pong
it sounds like lots of fun
wont you get on my back
for piggyback ride
get on my back
for piggyback ride
all right boys
all right
your mom kind of freaked me out
she means well
from troy michigan
would you please welcome
to cleveland
stillwater
father father
tell me the story
tell me what to do
doctor doctor
is there a cure
for the young mans broken blues
and he said
everybody knows
yeah you had to be there
girl you had to be there
did you see that chicks shirt
in front of russell
when you play a great show
like tonight
okay i need everyones attention
please
girls i need five minutes
with the band alone
right
well it seems the rumors are true
the record company has sent
a bigtime manager here
to try and talk you
into replacing me
his name is dennis hope
i know youve all heard of him
hes got all the big bands
and hes outside right now
and he wants five minutes with you
and well i think
weve gotta do this
well send him in
yeah bring him in
well send him out on a rail
all right
well finish the interview in maryland
you can fly home from maryland okay
hey weve already got a manager
hes been with us from the beginning
respectfully
we all have our roots
i believe in bands
holding on to their roots
those roots need to be augmented
your manager here
needs a manager
example if you hadnt have run out
on your contract in phoenix
we could have sued
over russells hand
but you left negating the contract
forfeiting the deposit
you effectively traveled a long way
to pay that promoter to electrocute you
okay your damages have put you
way in the hole for this tour
right now you owe the record company
more than youve got
but your records selling
theres money to be made
so i brought a plane in we could add
more shows to make up the difference
respectfully
we travel by bus
doris is the soul of this band
that bus has been our home since
we were the jeff bebe band no way
hey man id travel on a pogo stick
if i thought we could make more money
you could play more dates
with a plane
well its not about money its about
playing music and turning people on
clearly respectfully
why should we pay you for something
we can do ourselves
do you know how to keep
from getting charged
for the ice below the floorboards
at chicago stadium
do you know how to do
a headlining tour
do you know how to get a record
not pressed but played
you gotta take what you can
when you can while you can
and you gotta do it now
thats what the big boys do
because if you think mick jaggerll
still be out there
trying to be a rock star at age 50
youre sadly sadly mistaken
i didnt invent the rainy day man
i just own the best umbrella
im telling you youre coming along at
a very dangerous time for rock and roll
the war is over
they won
and they will ruin rock and roll
and strangle everything
we love about it
put em up
all right money down
one guy says  ill draw a picture
and you guess what it is all right
can i help you
is russell hammond here
hey the enemy

and pissed off
and i could be very dangerous
to all of you
i am not sweet
and you should know that about me
i am the enemy
look you should be happy for me
you dont know
what he says to me in private
maybe it is love
as much as it can be for somebody
who sold you to humble pie

write what you want
youre william miller
yep
oh baby
didnt anything happen i mean
after 600 in roomservice bills
didnt you get anything on tape
with russell hammond
and where were you in this piece
what did you wanna write
because this reads
like what they wanted you to write
you obviously saw more
than you wrote about
something must have happened
lets push up flippos who cover
good cause its gonna take me
three days to get through this research
its all handwritten
on little bits of paper
its a puffpiece
they refer to the women as chicks
as a woman i have a problem with that
you want em to like you
i know its a side issue
it happens
its embarrassing
ben you told me to send what i had
its not finished
give me tonight to work on it
oh man you made friends with em
see friendship is the booze
they feed you
cause they want you to get drunk
and feel like you belong
well it was fun
because they make you feel cool
and hey i met you you are not cool
i know
even when i thought i was
i knew i wasnt
because we are uncool
while women will always be
a problem for guys like us
most of the great art in the world
is about that very problem
goodlooking people
they got no spine
their art never lasts
they get the girls
but were smarter
yeah i can really see that now
yeah cause great artist about
you know guilt and longing
and you know
love disguised as sex
and sex disguised as love
hey lets face it
you got a big head start
im glad you were home
im always home
im uncool
me too
youre doing great you know
the only true currency
in this bankrupt world
is what you share with someone else
when youre uncool
listen my advice to you
and i know you think
these guys are your friends
if you wanna be a true friend to them
be honest and unmerciful
im flying high
over tupelo mississippi
with americas hottest band
and were all about to die
dark lively
yeah yeah and it gets better
did this all really happen
ill call and check the quotes
holy shit i just got off the phone
with rolling stone
they called me too
whats he using
all hes using it all
this according to the factchecker
so what
so what
we come off like amateurs
some average band trying to come
to grips with success
jealous and fighting
and breaking up
were buffoons
rock and roll can save the world
the chicks are great
i sound like a dick
you are a dick
i never said that
maybe we just dont see ourselves
the way we really are
is it that hard
to make us look cool
this kid has you on acid screaming
im a golden god from a fans rooftop
they used him to fuck us theyll
probably just put you on the cover
wait i never said
im a golden god
or did i
he was never a person
he was a journalist
its phenomenal william
to be quite honest with you
its sophisticated intelligent we
only had to cut out a couple of grafs
jeff bebes mother already sent over a
whole shoe box full of childhood photos
she did
but its really gonna look fantastic
the band just denied 90 percent
of the story its a fabrication
you werent honest
and worse you wasted our time
did you talk to russell hammond
russell hammond is the one
who denied it
now wait a second
denied it
were going with the who
manuscripts in my office
hes just some fan
what do you expect
so anyway put those two pieces
wait
you guys this is my brother
nice to finally meet you
you have a good day
you guys ill deadhead back later
i think im needed
ill see you
you look awful but its great
youre living your life
youre free of mom
hey ill take off work
lets have an adventure together
you and me finally
anywhere you wanna go
anywhere in the world
this is not my idea of a good time
just get me to my bed
ill deal with her
i forgive you
i didnt apologize
i am out of here
hey sapphire
hey boy
i hate goodbyes
me too
is penny okay
the quaaludes incident
well it wasnt pretty
she couldve died
you know i always told her not to let
too many guys fall in love with her
i guess i was wrong
one of them ended up saving her life
what do you care i mean
we all know what you did to him
i mean everybody knows
even penny lane
how you doing
can you believe these new girls
none of them use birth control
and they eat all the steak
i mean they dont even know
what it is to be a fan
you know to truly love some silly
little piece of music or some band
so much that it hurts
its russell
dont hang up
i cant really talk right now
im in a room full of people
actually im alone
i wont call again i promise
but i need to see you face to face
because im never as good
as when youre there
and i can see myself
the way you look at me
and im sorry if we could just get
together and find some time to talk
lets say all the things
we never said
give me your address
im coming to you
this time
got a pen
im russell hammond
so this is the famous russell hammond
come in
is she home
who anita
where am i
hello
you know when we spoke
i felt that we connected
oh man
my son is very important to me too
and i do think you owe him
an apology
i appreciate you showing up
no no i agree
maam
theres hope for you yet russell
well
so this is
where the enemy sleeps
you know i think we both wanted to
to be with her
and she wanted us to be together
you should give her a call
you both live in the same city
you really think i should
yeah
that girl really cares about you
man i never even knew her real name
oh i called your magazine
and told them the truth
i dont know
what theyre gonna do with it
but i told them
every word you wrote was true
we are gonna do this one more time
so russell
what do you love about music
to begin with
