when you wake up in the morning 
do you feel tired and rundown 
do you have that listless feeling 
 turns off ringing alarm clock 
 children talking  laughing 
 electric shaver buzzing 
 telephone ringing 
  jefferies

 jefferies  gunnison  how did
you get to be such a big editor
with such a small memory 
thrift  industry and hard work   
and catching the publisher
with his secretary

plaster cocoon

sorry for you  gunnison 
must be rough on you thinking of me
wearing this cast for another week 
that one week is gonna cost
me my best photographer 
and you a big assignment 
where 
 gunnison  there s no point
in even talking about it 
 jefferies 
oh  come on  come on  where 
kashmir  got a code tip from
the bureau chief this morning 
the place is about to go up in smoke 
what did i tell you  didn t i tell
you that s the next place to watch 
   gunnison  you did 
   jefferies  when do i leave  hour 
  with that cast on  you don t 
  stop sounding stuffy 
i can take pictures from a jeep
or a water buffalo  if necessary 
 gunnison  you re too valuable to the
magazine for us to play around with 
  i ll send morgan or lambert 
   jefferies  morgan or lambert 
that s fine 
i get myself half killed for you 
and you reward me
by stealing my assignments 
 gunnison  i didn t ask you to stand in
the middle of an automobile racetrack 
 jefferies  you asked for something
dramatically different 
  you got it 
   gunnison  so did you 
  goodbye  jeff 
  now  wait a minute  gunnison 
you ve got to get me out of here 
six weeks sitting
in a two room apartment
with nothing to do but look out
the window at the neighbours 
  bye  jeff 
  no  gunnison  i   
if you don t pull me out
of this swamp of boredom 
i m gonna do something drastic 
   gunnison  like what 
   jefferies   like what   get married 
then i ll never be able to go anywhere 
 gunnison 
it s about time you got married 
before you turn into
a lonesome and bitter  old man 
yeah  can t you just see me 
rushing home to a hot apartment
to listen to the automatic laundry
and the electric dishwasher
and the garbage disposal
and the nagging wife 
 gunnison  jeff  wives don t nag
any more  they discuss 
 jeff  is that so  is that so 
maybe in the high rent district
they discuss 
in my neighbourhood  they still nag 
 gunnison  well  you know best 
i ll call you later 
yeah  have some good news
the next time  huh 
 arguing  indistinct 
 woman 
good morning  i said   good morning  
oh  good morning 
 children laughing  playing 
say  i wouldn t dig so deep
if i were you 
you re giving them far too much water 
why don t you shut up 
well 
i do declare 
 woman  state sentence
for a peeping tom 
is six months in the workhouse 
oh  hello  sweetheart 
they got no windows in the workhouse 
in the old days  they used to put
your eyes out with a red hot poker 
any of those bikini bombshells
you re always watching
worth a red hot poker 
oh  dear 
we ve become a race of peeping toms 
what people ought to do
is get outside their own house
and look in for a change 
yes  sir  how s that for
a bit of homespun philosophy 
reader s digest   april 1939 
well  i only quote from the best 
you don t have to take
my temperature this morning 
quiet  see if you can break 100 
you know  i should have been
a gypsy fortune teller
instead of an insurance company nurse 
i got a nose for trouble 
can smell it ten miles away 
you heard of that market crash in  29 
i predicted that 
just how did you do that  stella 
oh  simple  i was nursing
a director of general motors 
 kidney ailment   they said 
 nerves   i said 
then i asked myself 
 what s general motors
got to be nervous about  
 overproduction   i says   collapse  
when general motors has to go
to the bathroom ten times a day 
the whole country s ready to let go 
you know  stella 
in economics  a kidney ailment
has no relationship to the stock market 
  none whatsoever 
   stella  crashed  didn t it 
i can smell trouble
right here in this apartment 
first you smash your leg 
then you get
to looking out the window 
see things you shouldn t see 
trouble 
i can see you in court now
surrounded by a bunch of lawyers
in double breasted suits 
you re pleading 
you say   judge 
it was only a bit of innocent fun 
i love my neighbours  like a father  
and the judge says 
 well  congratulations 
you ve just given birth
to three years in dannamora  
right now  i d welcome trouble 
you ve got a hormone deficiency 
how can you tell from a thermometer 
those bathing beauties
you ve been watching
haven t raised your temperature
one degree in a month 
here we go 
 sighs  one more week 
 groans  i think you re right 
i think there is gonna be
trouble around here 
i knew it 
ooh  do you ever heat that stuff 
gives your
circulation something to fight 
  what kind of trouble 
  lisa fremont 
you kidding 
she s a beautiful  young girl 
and you re a reasonably
healthy young man 
  she expects me to marry her 
  that s normal 
  i don t want to 
  that s abnormal 
i m just not ready for marriage 
every man s ready for marriage
when the right girl comes along 
lisa fremont is the right girl
for any man with half a brain
who can get one eye open 
she s alright 
  what did you do  have a fight 
  no 
  father loading up the shotgun 
  what 
  please  stella 
  it s happened before  you know 
some of the world s
happiest marriages have
started  under the gun  
as you might say 
  no  she s just not the girl for me 
  yeah  she s only perfect 
she s too perfect  she s too talented 
she s too beautiful 
she s too sophisticated 
she s too everything  but what i want 
is what you want
something you can discuss 
what  it s very simple  stella 
she belongs to that rarefied
atmosphere of park avenue 
expensive restaurants
and literary cocktail parties 
people with sense
belong wherever they re put 
can you imagine her tramping around
the world with a camera bum
who never has more than
a week s salary in the bank 
if she was only ordinary 
you never gonna get married 
i ll probably get married
one of these days 
but when i do  it s gonna be
to someone who thinks of life
not just as a new dress
and a lobster dinner
and the latest scandal 
i need a woman who s willing to   
hold it 
who s willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it 
so the honest thing for me to do
is just call the whole thing off 
let her find somebody else 
yeah  i can hear you now 
 get out of my life 
you perfectly wonderful woman  
look  mr jefferies 
i m not an educated woman 
but i can tell you one thing 
when a man and a woman see
each other and like each other 
they ought to come together  wham 
like a couple of taxis on broadway
and not sit around analysing each other
like two specimens in a bottle 
there s an intelligent way
to approach marriage 
intelligence 
nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence 
 laughs  modern marriage 
  no  we ve progressed emotionally 
  baloney 
once it was see somebody 
get excited  get married 
now  it s read a lot of books 
fence with a lot of four syllable
words  psychoanalyse each other
until you can t tell the difference
between a petting party
and a civil service exam 
people have different emotional levels  
when i married myles  we were both
a couple of maladjusted misfits 
we are still maladjusted  and we
have loved every minute of it 
well  that s fine  stella 
now  would you
fix me a sandwich  please 
yes  i will  and i ll spread
a little common sense on the bread 
lisa s loaded to her fingertips
with love for you 
i got two words of advice
for you  marry her 
  she pay you much 
  oh 
 chuckling 
there you are 
  here s the key 
  thank you 
well  if you want anything  just ring 
honey 
come on 
got to carry you over the threshold 
window shopper 
 piano  woman vocalising 
 children talking in distance 
 children shouting playfully 
how s your leg 
it hurts a little 
  and your stomach 
  empty as a football 
and your love life 
not too active 
anything else bothering you 
mm hm 
who are you 
reading from top to bottom 
lisa   
carol   
fremont 
is this the lisa fremont who
never wears the same dress twice 
only because it s expected of her 
it s right off the paris plane 
  do you think it ll sell 
  that depends on the quote 
let s see now 
there s the aeroplane ticket over 
import duties  hidden taxes 
  profit markup  
  a steal at  1 100 
eleven hundred 
they ought to list that dress
on the stock exchange 
we sell a dozen a day
in this price range 
who buys them  tax collectors 
even if i had to pay 
it would be worth it 
  just for the occasion 
  why  is something big going on 
it s going on right here  it s a big night 
it s just an old
run of the mill wednesday 
the calendar s full of them 
it s opening night of the last depressing
week of l b jefferies in a cast 
well  i haven t noticed
a big demand for tickets 
that s because i bought out the house 
you know  this cigarette box
has seen better days 
i picked that up in shanghai 
which has also seen better days 
it s cracked and you never use it 
it s too ornate 
i m sending up a plain  flat 
silver one with your initials 
that s no way to spend
your hard earned money 
i wanted to 
ooh 
what would you think of
starting off with dinner at  21   
you have  perhaps 
an ambulance downstairs 
no  better than that   21   
thank you for waiting  carl 
the kitchen s right there on the left 
i ll take the wine 
  good evening  mr jefferies 
  carl 
just put everything
in the oven  carl  on low 
  let s open the wine now 
   jeff  alright 
  it s a montrachet 
  a great big glassful 
there s a corkscrew right over there 
here  i ll do it 
  big enough 
  yeah  they re fine 
i can t think of anything more
boring or tiresome
than what you ve been through
and the last week must be the hardest 
alright  yeah  i want to get
this thing off and get moving 
well  i m going to make this
a week you ll never forget 
fine  thanks 
just a minute  carl 
  this will take care of the taxi 
  thank you  miss fremont 
  have a pleasant dinner  mr jefferies 
  alright  good night 
good night 
what a day i ve had 
  are you tired 
  not a bit 
i was all morning in a meeting 
then i had to dash to the waldorf
for a quick drink with madam dufrene 
who s just over from paris
with some spy reports 
then i had to go to  21  and have lunch
with the harper s bazaar people 
that s when i ordered dinner 
then i had two fall showings
20 blocks apart 
then i had to have a cocktail
with leland and slim hayward 
we re trying to get his new show 
then i had to dash back and change 
well  now  tell me 
what was mrs hayward wearing 
  she looked wonderfully cool 
  she didn t  did she 
she had on the most divine
italian hand printed  
  oh  italian 
  oh  you 
  italian  imagine 
  to think i planted three nice items
  in the columns about you today 
  you did 
  you can t buy that kind of publicity 
  i know 
someday you may want to
open up a studio of your own here 
how would i run it from  say  pakistan 
jeff   
isn t it time you came home 
you could pick your assignment 
  i wish there was one i wanted 
  make the one you want 
  you mean leave the magazine 
  yes 
  for what 
  for yourself and me 
i could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow 
  fashions  portraits 
   chuckles 
  now  don t laugh  i could do it 
  that s what i m afraid of 
can you see me driving down
to the fashion salon in a jeep
wearing combat boots and a three day
beard  wouldn t that make a hit 
i could see you looking
very handsome and successful
in a dark blue  flannel suit 
let s stop talking nonsense  shall we 
hm 
guess i d better
start setting up for dinner 
 bing crosby    to see you
  is to love you
  and i see you
  everywhere
  in the sunrise
  in the moonglow
  anyplace i look
  you re there
  to see you
  is to want you
  and i see you all the time
  on a sidewalk
  in a doorway
  on the lonely stairs i climb
  someday
  let me show you
  how happy endings start
  you ll find
  how well i know you
  cause to know you at all
  is to know you by heart
  to see you
  is to love you
  and you re never out of sight
  and i love you
  and i ll see you
  in the same old dream
  tonight  
 jeff  miss lonelyhearts 
at least that s something
you ll never have to worry about 
oh 
you can see my apartment from here 
all the way up on 63rd street 
no  not exactly 
but we have a little apartment here
that s probably as popular as yours 
you remember  of course 
miss torso  the ballet dancer 
she s like a queen bee
with her pick of the drones 
 lisa  i d say she s
doing a woman s hardest job 
juggling wolves 
thank you 
well  she picked the most
prosperous looking one 
she s not in love with him   
or any of them 
oh  how can you tell that from here 
you said it resembled
my apartment  didn t you 
i hope they re cooked this time 
 distant siren wailing 
 siren becoming louder 
 woman talking  indistinct 
   piano 
where s that
wonderful music coming from 
some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment 
well   
he lives alone 
probably had a very unhappy marriage 
oh  it s enchanting 
it s almost as if it were
being written especially for us 
hm  no wonder he s having
so much trouble with it 
at least you can t say
the dinner isn t right 
lisa    it s perfect 
as always 
there can t be that much difference
between people and the way they live 
we all eat  talk  drink 
laugh  wear clothes 
well  now look  
if you re saying all this because
you don t want to tell me the truth 
because you re hiding something from
me  then maybe i can understand 
i m not hiding anything  it s just that  
it doesn t make sense 
what s so different about it here
from there or anyplace you go
that one person couldn t live
in both places just as easily 
some people can 
now  if you ll just let me  
what is it but travelling from
one place to another taking pictures 
it s like being a tourist
on an endless vacation 
ok  that s your opinion 
you re entitled to it 
  now  let me give you my side 
  it s ridiculous to say
that it can only be done by a special 
private little group of anointed people 
i made a simple statement 
a true statement 
but i can back it up if you ll just
shut up for a minute 
if your opinion is as rude as your
manner  i don t think i care to hear it 
oh  come on now  simmer down 
i can t fit in here  you can t fit in there 
according to you  people
should be born  live and die
  on the same spot 
  shut up 
  did you ever eat fish heads and rice 
  of course not 
well  you might have to
if you went with me 
did you ever try to keep warm
in a c 54 at 15 000 feet 
20 degrees below zero 
oh  i do it all the time 
whenever i have
a few minutes after lunch 
did you ever get shot at  run over 
did you ever get sandbagged
because somebody got unfavourable
publicity from your camera 
did you ever    those high heels 
they ll be great in the jungle 
and the nylons
and those six ounce lingerie 
  three 
  alright  three 
they ll make a big hit in finland 
just before you freeze to death 
well  if there s one thing i know 
it s how to wear the proper clothes 
yeah  yeah 
well  try and find a raincoat in brazil 
even when it isn t raining 
lisa  in this job you carry one suitcase 
your home
is the available transportation 
you don t sleep very much 
you bathe less 
and sometimes the food that you eat
is made from things that you couldn t
even look at when they re alive 
jeff  you don t have to be deliberately
repulsive just to impress me i m wrong 
deliberately repulsive 
i m trying to make it sound good 
you just have to face it  lisa 
you re not meant for that kind of a life 
few people are 
  you re too stubborn to argue with 
  i m not stubborn  i m just truthful 
i know  a lesser man would have
told me it was one long holiday 
and i would have awakened
to a rude disillusionment 
well  now  wait a minute 
if you want to get vicious on this thing 
i d be happy to accommodate you 
no  i don t particularly want that 
so that s it 
you won t stay here 
and i can t go with you 
it would be the wrong thing 
you don t think either one
of us could ever change 
right now it doesn t seem so 
i i m in love with you 
i don t care what you do for a living 
i d like to be part of it somehow 
it s deflating to find out
the only way i can be part of it 
is to take out a subscription
to your magazine 
i guess i m not the girl i thought i was 
there s nothing wrong with you  lisa 
you ve got this town
in the palm of your hand 
not quite  it seems 
goodbye  jeff 
you mean good night 
  i mean what i said 
  well  lisa   
couldn t we just   
couldn t we just   
keep things status quo 
without any future 
well  when am i gonna see you again 
not for a long time 
at least    not until tomorrow night 
 woman screams  glass shatters 
 thunder rumbling 
 rain falling 
 whispering  hey  rain 
 whispering 
grab that  wait  i ll get the clock 
 whispering  oh  no 
 clock hits ground 
alarm begins ringing 
pull it 
pull on it  let me do it 
in you go   groaning 
 ringing stops 
 thunder rumbles 
 car horn honking 
 thunder rumbling 
no  you can t come in 
it s much too late 
no  not now 
no  i said good night 
 foghorn blaring in distance 
 rain dripping 
 children laughing  talking 
what s that supposed to be  ma am 
it s called hunger 
you d think the rain
would have cooled things off 
  all it did was make the heat wet 
  ahh  that s it 
that s stiff right there  right there 
the insurance company
would be much happier
if you d sleep in bed at night
instead of in that wheelchair 
  how do you know 
  eyes are all bloodshot 
must have been watching
out that window for hours 
yeah  i was 
what are you gonna do
if one of them catches you 
it depends which one 
miss torso  for example  
you keep your mind off her 
she sure is the
 eat  drink and be merry  girl 
yeah  she ll wind up fat 
alcoholic and miserable 
yeah 
speaking of misery 
poor miss lonelyhearts 
she drank herself to sleep again  alone 
poor soul  maybe one day
she ll find her happiness 
yeah  and some man will lose his 
isn t there anybody in the
neighbourhood
who could cast an eye in her direction 
well   
it might just be that the salesman
will be available soon 
oh  him and his wife splitting up 
i just can t figure it 
he went out several times
last night in the rain 
  carrying his sample case 
  well  he s a salesman  isn t he 
what would he be selling
at three o clock in the morning 
flashlights 
luminous dials for watches 
house numbers that light up 
i don t think so 
i don t think so 
i think he was taking
something out of the apartment 
uh huh  his personal effects 
he s gonna run out on her  the coward 
yeah  sometimes it s worse
to stay than it is to run 
yeah  well  it takes a particularly low
type of man to do a thing like that 
how about this morning 
any further developments 
the shades are all drawn
in the apartment 
  in this heat 
  yeah 
well  they re up now 
   woman vocalising 
  get back  get back 
  where do you want me to go 
  come on  get out of sight 
  what s the matter 
that salesman s looking out of
his window  you see 
get back  he ll see you 
i m not shy  i ve been looked at before 
 jeff  that s no ordinary look 
that s the kind of look a man gives
when he s afraid somebody
might be watching him 
 dog whimpering 
 woman  get away from there 
he ll be after you 
go on  into the house 
into the house  shoo  shoo 
goodbye  mr jefferies 
see you tomorrow 
     piano 
  uh huh 
  and don t sleep in that chair again 
  uh huh 
 uh huh  uh huh  
great conversationalist 
stella   
take those binoculars out
and bring them here  will you 
trouble 
i can smell it 
i ll be glad when they crack
that cast  and i can get outta here 
uh huh 
   piano 
   piano resumes 
   whistling 
 barking 
   whistling tune 
how far does a girl have to go
before you ll notice her 
well  if she s pretty enough 
she doesn t have to go anywhere 
she just has to  be  
well  ain t i 
pay attention to me 
i m not exactly
on the other side of the room 
your mind is    and when
i want a man  i want all of him 
don t you ever have any problems 
i have one now 
so do i 
tell me about it 
why 
why would a man leave
his apartment three times
on a rainy night with a suitcase 
and come back three times 
he likes the way his wife
welcomes him home 
no  no  not this salesman s wife 
and why didn t he go to work today 
homework  it s more interesting 
what s interesting about a butcher knife
and a small saw
wrapped in newspaper 
nothing  thank heaven 
why hasn t he been
in his wife s bedroom all day 
i wouldn t dare answer that 
well  listen  i ll answer it  lisa 
there s something terribly wrong 
   lisa  and i m afraid it s with me 
  what do you think 
something too frightful to utter 
 jeff  he went out a few minutes
ago in his undershirt  hasn t come back 
that would be a terrible job to tackle 
   piano 
just how would you start
to cut up a human body 
jeff  i ll be honest with you 
you re beginning to scare me 
jeff  did you hear what i said 
you re beginning to scare  
shh  he s coming back 
  jeff  if you could only see yourself 
  what s the matter 
sitting around looking out of the
window to kill time is one thing 
but doing it the way
you are with binoculars
and wild opinions about every
little thing you see is diseased 
do you think i consider it recreation 
i don t know what you consider it 
but if you don t stop it 
i m getting out of here 
  what s the  
  what is it you re looking for 
i just want to find out what s
the matter with the salesman s wife 
does that make me
sound like a madman 
what makes you think there s
something the matter with her 
a lot of things  she s an invalid 
she demands constant care 
yet not the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day  why 
  maybe she died 
   jeff  where s the doctor 
where s the undertaker 
she could be sleeping  under sedatives 
he s in there now 
there s nothing to see 
there is something 
i ve seen it through that window 
i ve seen bickering and family quarrels
and mysterious trips at night
and knives and saws and rope 
now  since last evening  not a sign
of the wife  tell me where she is 
  i don t know 
  what s she doing 
maybe he s leaving his wife 
i don t know  i don t care 
lots of people have knives and saws
and ropes around their houses 
and lots of men don t speak
to their wives all day 
lots of wives nag and
men hate them and trouble starts 
but few of them end up in murder 
if that s what you re thinking 
it s pretty hard for you to keep
away from that word  isn t it 
you could see all that he did 
couldn t you 
  of course  i  
  you could see cos the shades were up
and he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard 
i ve seen him  
jeff  do you think a murderer
would let you see all that 
that he wouldn t pull the shades
down and hide behind them 
he s being clever  he s being nonchalant 
and that s
where you re not bring clever 
a murderer would never parade
his crime in front of an open window 
why not 
for all you know  there s
something sinister going on there 
where  oh 
 laughs  no comment 
let s start
from the beginning again  jeff 
tell me everything you saw
and what you think it means 
   telephone rings 
  yeah 
 lisa   the name on the second floor
rear mail box reads 
 mr and mrs lars   
 that s l a r s  
 lars thorwald  
what s the number of the apartment 
 lisa   125 west ninth street  
thank you  dear 
 lisa   ok  chief 
what s my next assignment  
just go home 
 lisa 
 alright  but what s he doing now  
he s just sitting
in the living room in the dark 
hasn t gone near the bedroom 
now you go home
and get some sleep  good night 
 lisa   good night  
 man   what s it about  jeff  
look  doyle 
i can t tell you over the phone 
you have to be here
and see the whole set up 
it s probably nothing 
it s just a little neighbourhood murder 
   doyle   did you say murder  
  yes  as a matter of fact  i did 
 doyle   oh  come now  
my only thought was throwing a little
business your way  that s all 
i figured a detective would jump at
the chance of something to detect 
   doyle   i m not working  
  what 
 doyle 
 this happens to be my day off  
i usually took my best pictures
on my day off 
   doyle   i ll drop by  
  ok  doyle  as soon as you can 
bless your heart  stella 
gee whiz  look at this 
i can t tell you
what a welcome sight this is 
no wonder your husband still loves you 
  the police 
  what 
  you called the police 
  well  not exactly 
not an official call 
it s an old friend of mine 
an old  ornery friend of mine
