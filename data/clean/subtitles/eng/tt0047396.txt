rushing home to a hot apartment
to listen to the automatic laundry
and the electric dishwasher
and the garbage disposal
and the nagging wife

arguing indistinct
woman

children laughing playing

youre giving them far too much water
why dont you shut up
well
i do declare
woman state sentence
for a peeping tom
is six months in the workhouse
oh hello sweetheart
they got no windows in the workhouse
in the old days they used to put
your eyes out with a redhot poker
any of those bikini bombshells
youre always watching
worth a redhot poker
oh dear
weve become a race of peeping toms
what people ought to do
is get outside their own house
and look in for a change
yes sir hows that for
a bit of homespun philosophy
readers digest  april 1939
well i only quote from the best
you dont have to take
my temperature this morning
quiet see if you can break 100
you know i should have been
a gypsy fortuneteller
instead of an insurance company nurse
i got a nose for trouble
can smell it ten miles away
you heard of that market crash in 29
i predicted that
just how did you do that stella
oh simple i was nursing
a director of general motors
kidney ailment they said
nerves i said
then i asked myself
whats general motors
got to be nervous about
overproduction i says collapse
when general motors has to go
to the bathroom ten times a day
the whole countrys ready to let go
you know stella
in economics a kidney ailment
has no relationship to the stock market
none whatsoever
stella crashed didnt it
i can smell trouble
right here in this apartment
first you smash your leg
then you get
to looking out the window
see things you shouldnt see
trouble
i can see you in court now
surrounded by a bunch of lawyers
in doublebreasted suits
youre pleading
you say judge
it was only a bit of innocent fun
i love my neighbours like a father
and the judge says
well congratulations
youve just given birth
to three years in dannamora
right now id welcome trouble
youve got a hormone deficiency
how can you tell from a thermometer
those bathing beauties
youve been watching
havent raised your temperature
one degree in a month
here we go
sighs one more week
groans i think youre right
i think there is gonna be
trouble around here
i knew it
ooh do you ever heat that stuff
gives your
circulation something to fight
what kind of trouble
lisa fremont
you kidding
shes a beautiful young girl
and youre a reasonably
healthy young man
she expects me to marry her
thats normal
i dont want to
thats abnormal
im just not ready for marriage
every mans ready for marriage
when the right girl comes along
lisa fremont is the right girl
for any man with half a brain
who can get one eye open
shes alright
what did you do have a fight
no
father loading up the shotgun
what
please stella
its happened before you know
some of the worlds
happiest marriages have
started under the gun
as you might say
no shes just not the girl for me
yeah shes only perfect
shes too perfect shes too talented
shes too beautiful
shes too sophisticated
shes too everything but what i want
is what you want
something you can discuss
what its very simple stella
she belongs to that rarefied
atmosphere of park avenue
expensive restaurants
and literary cocktail parties
people with sense
belong wherever theyre put
can you imagine her tramping around
the world with a camera bum
who never has more than
a weeks salary in the bank
if she was only ordinary
you never gonna get married
ill probably get married
one of these days
but when i do its gonna be
to someone who thinks of life
not just as a new dress
and a lobster dinner
and the latest scandal
i need a woman whos willing to
hold it
whos willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it
so the honest thing for me to do
is just call the whole thing off
let her find somebody else
yeah i can hear you now
get out of my life
you perfectly wonderful woman
look mr jefferies
im not an educated woman
but i can tell you one thing
when a man and a woman see
each other and like each other
they ought to come together wham
like a couple of taxis on broadway
and not sit around analysing each other
like two specimens in a bottle
theres an intelligent way
to approach marriage
intelligence
nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence
laughs modern marriage
no weve progressed emotionally
baloney
once it was see somebody
get excited get married
now its read a lot of books
fence with a lot of foursyllable
words psychoanalyse each other
until you cant tell the difference
between a petting party
and a civil service exam
people have different emotional levels
when i married myles we were both
a couple of maladjusted misfits
we are still maladjusted and we
have loved every minute of it
well thats fine stella
now would you
fix me a sandwich please
yes i will and ill spread
a little common sense on the bread
lisas loaded to her fingertips
with love for you
i got two words of advice
for you marry her
she pay you much
oh
chuckling
there you are
heres the key
thank you
well if you want anything just ring
honey
come on
got to carry you over the threshold
window shopper
piano woman vocalising
children talking in distance
children shouting playfully
hows your leg
it hurts a little
and your stomach
empty as a football
and your love life
not too active
anything else bothering you
mmhm
who are you
reading from top to bottom
lisa
carol
fremont
is this the lisa fremont who
never wears the same dress twice
only because its expected of her
its right off the paris plane
do you think itll sell
that depends on the quote
lets see now
theres the aeroplane ticket over
import duties hidden taxes
profit markup
a steal at 1100
eleven hundred
they ought to list that dress
on the stock exchange
we sell a dozen a day
in this price range
who buys them tax collectors
even if i had to pay
it would be worth it
just for the occasion
why is something big going on
its going on right here its a big night
its just an old
runofthemill wednesday
the calendars full of them
its opening night of the last depressing
week of l b jefferies in a cast
well i havent noticed
a big demand for tickets
thats because i bought out the house
you know this cigarette box
has seen better days
i picked that up in shanghai
which has also seen better days
its cracked and you never use it
its too ornate
im sending up a plain flat
silver one with your initials
thats no way to spend
your hardearned money
i wanted to
ooh
what would you think of
starting off with dinner at 21
you have perhaps
an ambulance downstairs
no better than that 21
thank you for waiting carl
the kitchens right there on the left
ill take the wine
good evening mr jefferies
carl
just put everything
in the oven carl on low
lets open the wine now
jeff alright
its a montrachet
a great big glassful
theres a corkscrew right over there
here ill do it
big enough
yeah theyre fine
i cant think of anything more
boring or tiresome
than what youve been through
and the last week must be the hardest
alright yeah i want to get
this thing off and get moving
well im going to make this
a week youll never forget
fine thanks
just a minute carl
this will take care of the taxi
thank you miss fremont
have a pleasant dinner mr jefferies
alright good night
good night
what a day ive had
are you tired
not a bit
i was all morning in a meeting
then i had to dash to the waldorf
for a quick drink with madam dufrene
whos just over from paris
with some spy reports
then i had to go to 21 and have lunch
with the harpers bazaar people
thats when i ordered dinner
then i had two fall showings
20 blocks apart
then i had to have a cocktail
with leland and slim hayward
were trying to get his new show
then i had to dash back and change
well now tell me
what was mrs hayward wearing
she looked wonderfully cool
she didnt did she
she had on the most divine
italian handprinted
oh italian
oh you
italian imagine
to think i planted three nice items
in the columns about you today
you did
you cant buy that kind of publicity
i know
someday you may want to
open up a studio of your own here
how would i run it from say pakistan
jeff
isnt it time you came home
you could pick your assignment
i wish there was one i wanted
make the one you want
you mean leave the magazine
yes
for what
for yourself and me
i could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow
fashions portraits
chuckles
now dont laugh i could do it
thats what im afraid of
can you see me driving down
to the fashion salon in a jeep
wearing combat boots and a threeday
beard wouldnt that make a hit
i could see you looking
very handsome and successful
in a dark blue flannel suit
lets stop talking nonsense shall we
hm
guess id better
start setting up for dinner
bing crosby  to see you
is to love you
and i see you
everywhere
in the sunrise
in the moonglow
anyplace i look
youre there
to see you
is to want you
and i see you all the time
on a sidewalk
in a doorway
on the lonely stairs i climb
someday
let me show you
how happy endings start
youll find
how well i know you
cause to know you at all
is to know you by heart
to see you
is to love you
and youre never out of sight
and i love you
and ill see you
in the same old dream
tonight
jeff miss lonelyhearts
at least thats something
youll never have to worry about
oh
you can see my apartment from here
all the way up on 63rd street
no not exactly
but we have a little apartment here
thats probably as popular as yours
you remember of course
miss torso the ballet dancer
shes like a queen bee
with her pick of the drones
lisa id say shes
doing a womans hardest job
juggling wolves
thank you
well she picked the most
prosperouslooking one
shes not in love with him
or any of them
oh how can you tell that from here
you said it resembled
my apartment didnt you
i hope theyre cooked this time
distant siren wailing
siren becoming louder
woman talking indistinct
piano
wheres that
wonderful music coming from
some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment
well
he lives alone
probably had a very unhappy marriage
oh its enchanting
its almost as if it were
being written especially for us
hm no wonder hes having
so much trouble with it
at least you cant say
the dinner isnt right
lisa its perfect
as always
there cant be that much difference
between people and the way they live
we all eat talk drink
laugh wear clothes
well now look
if youre saying all this because
you dont want to tell me the truth
because youre hiding something from
me then maybe i can understand
im not hiding anything its just that
it doesnt make sense
whats so different about it here
from there or anyplace you go
that one person couldnt live
in both places just as easily
some people can
now if youll just let me
what is it but travelling from
one place to another taking pictures
its like being a tourist
on an endless vacation
ok thats your opinion
youre entitled to it
now let me give you my side
its ridiculous to say
that it can only be done by a special
private little group of anointed people
i made a simple statement
a true statement
but i can back it up if youll just
shut up for a minute
if your opinion is as rude as your
manner i dont think i care to hear it
oh come on now simmer down
i cant fit in here you cant fit in there
according to you people
should be born live and die
on the same spot
shut up
did you ever eat fish heads and rice
of course not
well you might have to
if you went with me
did you ever try to keep warm
in a c54 at 15000 feet
20 degrees below zero
oh i do it all the time
whenever i have
a few minutes after lunch
did you ever get shot at run over
did you ever get sandbagged
because somebody got unfavourable
publicity from your camera
did you ever those high heels
theyll be great in the jungle
and the nylons
and those sixounce lingerie
three
alright three
theyll make a big hit in finland
just before you freeze to death
well if theres one thing i know
its how to wear the proper clothes
yeah yeah
well try and find a raincoat in brazil
even when it isnt raining
lisa in this job you carry one suitcase
your home
is the available transportation
you dont sleep very much
you bathe less
and sometimes the food that you eat
is made from things that you couldnt
even look at when theyre alive
jeff you dont have to be deliberately
repulsive just to impress me im wrong
deliberately repulsive
im trying to make it sound good
you just have to face it lisa
youre not meant for that kind of a life
few people are
youre too stubborn to argue with
im not stubborn im just truthful
i know a lesser man would have
told me it was one long holiday
and i would have awakened
to a rude disillusionment
well now wait a minute
if you want to get vicious on this thing
id be happy to accommodate you
no i dont particularly want that
so thats it
you wont stay here
and i cant go with you
it would be the wrong thing
you dont think either one
of us could ever change
right now it doesnt seem so
iim in love with you
i dont care what you do for a living
id like to be part of it somehow
its deflating to find out
the only way i can be part of it
is to take out a subscription
to your magazine
i guess im not the girl i thought i was
theres nothing wrong with you lisa
youve got this town
in the palm of your hand
not quite it seems
goodbye jeff
you mean good night
i mean what i said
well lisa
couldnt we just
couldnt we just
keep things status quo
without any future
well when am i gonna see you again
not for a long time
at least not until tomorrow night
woman screams glass shatters
thunder rumbling
rain falling
whispering hey rain
whispering
grab that wait ill get the clock
whispering oh no
clock hits ground
alarm begins ringing
pull it
pull on it let me do it
in you go groaning
ringing stops
thunder rumbles
car horn honking
thunder rumbling
no you cant come in
its much too late
no not now
no i said good night
foghorn blaring in distance
rain dripping
children laughing talking
whats that supposed to be maam
its called hunger
youd think the rain
would have cooled things off
all it did was make the heat wet
ahh thats it
thats stiff right there right there
the insurance company
would be much happier
if youd sleep in bed at night
instead of in that wheelchair
how do you know
eyes are all bloodshot
must have been watching
out that window for hours
yeah i was
what are you gonna do
if one of them catches you
it depends which one
miss torso for example
you keep your mind off her
she sure is the
eat drink and be merry girl
yeah shell wind up fat
alcoholic and miserable
yeah
speaking of misery
poor miss lonelyhearts
she drank herself to sleep again alone
poor soul maybe one day
shell find her happiness
yeah and some man will lose his
isnt there anybody in the
neighbourhood
who could cast an eye in her direction
well
it might just be that the salesman
will be available soon
oh him and his wife splitting up
i just cant figure it
he went out several times
last night in the rain
carrying his sample case
well hes a salesman isnt he
what would he be selling
at three oclock in the morning
flashlights
luminous dials for watches
house numbers that light up
i dont think so
i dont think so
i think he was taking
something out of the apartment
uhhuh his personal effects
hes gonna run out on her the coward
yeah sometimes its worse
to stay than it is to run
yeah well it takes a particularly low
type of man to do a thing like that
how about this morning
any further developments
the shades are all drawn
in the apartment
in this heat
yeah
well theyre up now
woman vocalising
get back get back
where do you want me to go
come on get out of sight
whats the matter
that salesmans looking out of
his window you see
get back hell see you
im not shy ive been looked at before
jeff thats no ordinary look
thats the kind of look a man gives
when hes afraid somebody
might be watching him
dog whimpering
woman get away from there
hell be after you
go on into the house
into the house shoo shoo
goodbye mr jefferies
see you tomorrow
piano
uhhuh
and dont sleep in that chair again
uhhuh
uhhuh uhhuh
great conversationalist
stella
take those binoculars out
and bring them here will you
trouble
i can smell it
ill be glad when they crack
that cast and i can get outta here
uhhuh
piano
piano resumes
whistling
barking
whistling tune
how far does a girl have to go
before youll notice her
well if shes pretty enough
she doesnt have to go anywhere
she just has to be
well aint i
pay attention to me
im not exactly
on the other side of the room
your mind is and when
i want a man i want all of him
dont you ever have any problems
i have one now
so do i
tell me about it
why
why would a man leave
his apartment three times
on a rainy night with a suitcase
and come back three times
he likes the way his wife
welcomes him home
no no not this salesmans wife
and why didnt he go to work today
homework its more interesting
whats interesting about a butcher knife
and a small saw
wrapped in newspaper
nothing thank heaven
why hasnt he been
in his wifes bedroom all day
i wouldnt dare answer that
well listen ill answer it lisa
theres something terribly wrong
lisa and im afraid its with me
what do you think
something too frightful to utter
jeff he went out a few minutes
ago in his undershirt hasnt come back
that would be a terrible job to tackle
piano
just how would you start
to cut up a human body
jeff ill be honest with you
youre beginning to scare me
jeff did you hear what i said
youre beginning to scare
shh hes coming back
jeff if you could only see yourself
whats the matter
sitting around looking out of the
window to kill time is one thing
but doing it the way
you are with binoculars
and wild opinions about every
little thing you see is diseased
do you think i consider it recreation
i dont know what you consider it
but if you dont stop it
im getting out of here
whats the
what is it youre looking for
i just want to find out whats
the matter with the salesmans wife
does that make me
sound like a madman
what makes you think theres
something the matter with her
a lot of things shes an invalid
she demands constant care
yet not the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day why
maybe she died
jeff wheres the doctor
wheres the undertaker
she could be sleeping under sedatives
hes in there now
theres nothing to see
there is something
ive seen it through that window
ive seen bickering and family quarrels
and mysterious trips at night
and knives and saws and rope
now since last evening not a sign
of the wife tell me where she is
i dont know
whats she doing
maybe hes leaving his wife
i dont know i dont care
lots of people have knives and saws
and ropes around their houses
and lots of men dont speak
to their wives all day
lots of wives nag and
men hate them and trouble starts
but few of them end up in murder
if thats what youre thinking
its pretty hard for you to keep
away from that word isnt it
you could see all that he did
couldnt you
of course i
you could see cos the shades were up
and he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard
ive seen him
jeff do you think a murderer
would let you see all that
that he wouldnt pull the shades
down and hide behind them
hes being clever hes being nonchalant
and thats
where youre not bring clever
a murderer would never parade
his crime in front of an open window
why not
for all you know theres
something sinister going on there
where oh
laughs no comment
lets start
from the beginning again jeff
tell me everything you saw
and what you think it means
telephone rings
yeah
lisa the name on the second floor
rear mail box reads
mr and mrs lars
thats lars
lars thorwald

and see the whole setup
its probably nothing
its just a little neighbourhood murder
doyle did you say murder

doyle oh come now

business your way thats all
i figured a detective would jump at
the chance of something to detect
doyle im not working

i usually took my best pictures
on my day off
doyle ill drop by
ok doyle as soon as you can

its an old friend of mine
an old ornery friend of mine
