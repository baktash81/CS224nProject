that trains dogs
to sniff cancer
cancer
yeah
sounds pretty wacky but

so were a pilot program
which is very exciting
because weve been getting
amazing results
wait so youre telling me
these dogs know people
have cancer before doctors do
we see the world
dogs smell it
their sense of smell is
100000 times as acute as ours
so were working on trying
to get the dogs to recognize
the difference between cancer
samples and benign samples
if we successfully
scenttrain a dog
it can make the difference
between life and death
wait so i get
to scenttrain a dog
thats so cool
i love the enthusiasm
but first
i hope this isnt cjs purpose
we went every day
cj was happy
and that made me happy
why is he getting treats

was the only thing
i ever got from my dad
that was the only thing
that made me feel like
somewhere in the world
there might actually be
someone looking out for me

really stupid wasnt it
you cannot take the car

i never knew there could be
such a thing as a sad car ride

a few things out of the way
i need to play
i need to wrestle
i need to bite a few faces
i need to bark

i dont know why
she left me behind
i waited so long
i got older and older
and when it was time i knew
i guess i wasnt gonna be
with cj in this life
i had a good life with joe
but it was really hard knowing
cj was out there without me
i knew our journey wasnt over
i came back small
but i was not gonna
let that stop me
ive been born
enough times now to know
that when youre hungry
you have got to fight for it
so apparently
my growing phase was over
i was gonna remain small
catsized
if i was gonna find cj
i was gonna need
a new strategy
look at you
you are so cute
hey i already belong to somebody
were really looking
for an older dog
i have the perfect dog for you
mm
sorry about that
nothing personal
aw how sweet
this little cutie
would fit in my purse
nope
keep moving
good going old guy
oh shes gonna be tricky
wait wait
i know that sound
could it be
i think it might be
what if it is
im sorry max but im gonna
have to take you back
to the shelter
i have to find out
i dont want to have
to do this but
ow oh oh max
sorry youve been great
thanks for all the food and water
max max
whoa this place is huge
out of my way
dog coming through
sorry about that
being small does have
some advantages
wow that smells good
maybe just one lick
no forget that
i cannot let her get away this time
i cant see a thing
i need to get to higher ground
square
park is a 97acre park
oh yeah there she is

i cant believe
youre in new york
i never saw you
as a bigcity guy
well i was in london
for a while
and when the opportunity
came up here
i thought to myself
why not give it a try
my nose told me rocky was gone
poor trent
a person cant be happy
without a dog
well its a pretty nice place
you must be doing okay
i wonder what the snack
situation is here
sorry

i follow the rules
i always admired how you
didnt care about the rules
mm yeah well
gloria didnt exactly
teach me to follow rules
how is your mom
oh i dont know
i havent spoken to her
in years
mm
hows the music career
good yeah
i mean its hard
plus im walking
all these dogs now
just to pay the bills
so its
thats a relief
uh for a second
i thought youd become
one of those
outofcontrol dog ladies
cj was happy
and it made her laugh
she never laughs with barry
all right well
i should probably get going
yeah
hey uh my girlfriend
is coming in next weekend
uh maybe we could do
a double date
with you and your boyfriend
yeah sure wed love that
okay
okay
cj seemed sad
after we left trent
i could tell she wanted trent
in our pack
so did i
which meant
barry had to go
hey hey hey hey cj
barrys
cj
ive been
holding this in all day
and its go time
cj
yes
just saying
if i have to bite this guy
to get rid of him

adopting a dog
was such a stupid decision
why are you saying that
look at you cj
your career is nowhere

i dont need any help
feeling bad about myself
yeah well i just dont think

it didnt make any sense
wake up with
somebody near you
it was just me and cj
and we moved around a lot
we went on a lot of walks
every couple of days
we were sleeping somewhere new
but we never saw trent
even when we knew where he was
watched the beard
crawl around on your face
i stayed close to cj but
she still seemed sad

a professional dog walker
what happened to you
oh yeah

um music is what
i really care about
oh so you have a band
nope no band
just me and my guitar
oh where do you play
uh well
i havent exactly
booked a gig yet
kind of just been working
on my songs
i wanted to have a whole set
before i started playing
in public
oh so i mean
music is on the side
and dog walking is
your real job then right
liesl didnt pee on anything
but she was definitely
marking her territory
ready for food here
lets go put the bowl down
okay okay
ah sit
good boy
oh this is delicious
best meal ever
whoa slow down max

the best meal of my life
good to have trent back
in the pack
can i say something
you may not want to hear
sure
i think you have stage fright
wait that smell
i
okay fine
maybe i have
a little stage fright
but well i dont know
maybe my songs
just arent ready yet
hmm well
i remember that smell
from when i was molly
how will you know
whether theyre ready
if you dont play them
right
oh
thats a cute little trick
i smelled the smell
now i get a treat
you see that
wow
trent how long have you
been wiped out like this
wiped out
um
actually
since i moved back from london
i guess im
im just jetlagged
you do you think maybe
you should see a doctor
just to make sure

youre changing the subject
from your musical career
i am gonna think
about that okay

go see a doctor
okay

to the hospital max
when i get back
well go on a long walk okay
trent went away
and then cj was gone a lot

if anybody ever needed a dog
it was gloria
oh ah
she needed love

so clarity i
i have been sober for um
nine months and 13 days
and
i was not a good mother
and i am sso sorry clarity
and

letters from him
that he wrote to me
when i was pregnant
with you
um
and your grandparents

it is so important
that you know who he was
because he was
i dont want to read these
gloria
oh yes you do
yeah
just trust me
on that one thing
and um
i know itit may take time
i do hope that someday
you can forgive me

pretty good ear scratcher too
maybe there is hope for her
after all
the papers smelled
like hannahs boy
they made me think of ethan
and hannah and the farm
gloria i miss you
i think im gonna get
the motorola job
i saw an apartment
next to a park
that would be perfect
for the baby

know what were doing
but we have each other
and we will figure it out
together
we can spend the summer
with my mom and ethan
at the farm in michigan
i know my mom will be
super helpful to us
she is so excited
to be a grandmother
i cannot wait to meet
our little girl
how do you raise a child
to be strong and bold
to believe in herself
shell have a good start
with you as her mom
i have so many dreams for her and for us
cant believe im taking
my mothers advice but
if i dont try it
ill never know will i max
will i
sometimes the best thing you can do
is just be there
even if your ribs get
a little bit crushed
and it makes you want to go
all the times
i doubted myself
all these stories
that i couldnt tell
wouldnt stand
in front of a crowd
or say my thoughts too loud
but theres a fire
im feeling
that burns me up
for once in my life
im ready to jump
im falling fearless
no other way to do this
