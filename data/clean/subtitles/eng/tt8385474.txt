i i i knew you wanted
that money
so you can fix
this crumbling farm 
this farm is not crumbling 
ethan was mad 
i hadn t heard him talk
like that in a long time 
it has nothing to do
with the money 
it has to do with providing
a loving home for cj 
well  hannah  i am her mother 
so  wherever i am 
that is her home 
and okay  wow  obviously 
i m not welcome here 
you are always welcome here

every single day 
no  thank you  it s actually
not what i need right now 
well  what about cj

i was such an idiot 
hey  it happens 
you never make bad choices 
i m too afraid of my parents 
at least you don t have to do
a hundred hours
of community service 
wait  so you re gonna be
one of those people
picking up trash
on the side of the highway 
no  actually 
i got assigned to this program
that trains dogs
to sniff cancer 
  cancer 
  yeah 
sounds pretty wacky  but   
at least i get
to take molly with me 
so  we re a pilot program 
which is very exciting
because we ve been getting
amazing results 
wait  so you re telling me
these dogs know people
have cancer before doctors do 
we see the world 
dogs smell it 
their sense of smell is
100 000 times as acute as ours 
so  we re working on trying
to get the dogs to recognize
the difference between cancer
samples and benign samples 
if we successfully
scent train a dog 
it can make the difference
between life and death 
wait  so i get
to scent train a dog 
that s so cool 
i love the enthusiasm 
but first   
i hope this isn t cj s purpose 
we went every day 
cj was happy 
and that made me happy 
why is he getting treats 
i want treats  too 
  good dog  bode 
  okay 
if bode gets one more treat
and i get nothing 
i m gonna go nuts 
good boy  good boy  bode 
mm  that smell 
is that why bode gets treats 
maybe if i   
  did you see that 
  yeah 
good girl 
that s it 
if you smell the smell 
you get a treat 
cj  do you mind if i start
training molly  too 
good girl  molly

mom  that money
was the only thing
i ever got from my dad 
that was the only thing
that made me feel like 
somewhere in the world 
there might actually be
someone looking out for me 
but i guess that was
really stupid  wasn t it 
you cannot take the car 
why not  i paid for it 
i never knew there could be
such a thing as a sad car ride

i need to bite a few faces 
i need to bark

day after day passed

i don t know why
she left me behind 
i waited so long 
i got older and older 
and when it was time  i knew 
i guess i wasn t gonna be
with cj in this life 
i had a good life with joe 
but it was really hard knowing
cj was out there without me 
i knew our journey wasn t over 
i came back small 
but i was not gonna
let that stop me 
i ve been born
enough times now to know
that when you re hungry 
you have got to fight for it 
so  apparently 
my growing phase was over 
i was gonna remain small 
cat sized 
if i was gonna find cj 
i was gonna need
a new strategy 
look at you 
you are so cute 
hey  i already belong to somebody 
we re really looking
for an older dog 
i have the perfect dog for you 
mm 
sorry about that 
nothing personal 
aw  how sweet 
this little cutie
would fit in my purse 
nope 
keep moving 
good going  old guy 
oh  she s gonna be tricky 
wait  wait 
i know that sound 
could it be 
i think it might be 
what if it is 
i m sorry  max  but i m gonna
have to take you back
to the shelter 
i have to find out 
i don t want to have
to do this  but   
  ow  oh  oh  max

  thanks for all the food and water 
  max  max 
whoa  this place is huge 
out of my way 
dog coming through

being small does have
some advantages 
wow  that smells good 
maybe just one lick 
no  forget that 
i cannot let her get away this time 
i can t see a thing 
i need to get to higher ground 
   square
park is a 9 7 acre park   
oh  yeah  there she is 
afternoon

i m not gonna lose you
this time

it s like he chose you 
i can t 
i i live with my boyfriend

i   
i really can t bring home
another one 
that s too bad 
he s scheduled
to be put down tomorrow 
wait  are you serious 
w we do our best to foster out
to no kill shelters 
but they re full 
we re full 
max is taking a place
that could go to another dog 
  oh  but you can t

it has to keep flowing 
or it backs up 
duke 
ah ah ah ah  sit

you told me about 
yep 
keep your distance 
i m protecting cj now 
great personality 
he just needs a minute
to warm up 
and duke loves
having a playmate 
and i guess playing your music
for two dogs is
better than one dog  right 
right 
they re a good audience 
too bad dogs don t buy records 
look  i m gonna play for people
when i m ready  all right 
every day 
cj walked a huge group of dogs 
they knew i was in charge 
  hey 
  hey

who s this little guy 
oh  um  that s max 
be careful 
he s not very friendly 
oh  trent 
i m so glad to see you 
where s rocky 
he seems pretty friendly to me 
i can t believe
you re in new york 
i never saw you
as a big city guy 
well  i was in london
for a while 
and when the opportunity
came up here 
i thought to myself 
 why not give it a try  
my nose told me rocky was gone 
poor trent 
a person can t be happy
without a dog 
well  it s a pretty nice place 
you must be doing okay 
i wonder what the snack
situation is here 
sorry 
you know me 
i follow the rules 
i always admired how you
didn t care about the rules 
mm  yeah  well 
gloria didn t exactly
teach me to follow rules 
how is your mom 
oh  i don t know 
i haven t spoken to her
in years 
mm 
how s the music career 
good  yeah 
i mean  it s hard 
plus  i m walking
all these dogs now
just to pay the bills 
so it s   
that s a relief 
uh  for a second 
i thought you d become
one of those
out of control dog ladies 
cj was happy 
and it made her laugh 
she never laughs with barry 
all right  well 
i should probably get going 
yeah 
hey  uh  my girlfriend
is coming in next weekend 
uh  maybe we could do
a double date
with you and your boyfriend 
yeah  sure  we d love that 
okay 
okay 
cj seemed sad
after we left trent 
i could tell she wanted trent
in our pack 
so did i 
which meant   
barry had to go 
hey  hey  hey  hey  cj 
barry s 
cj 
i ve been
holding this in all day 
and it s go time 
cj 
yes 
just saying 
if i have to bite this guy
to get rid of him 
i absolutely will 
adopting a dog
was such a stupid decision 
why are you saying that 
look at you  cj 
your career is nowhere 
okay  thanks  barry 
i don t need any help
feeling bad about myself 
yeah  well  i just don t think
you have what it takes 
i don t want to be here
anymore 
where are you gonna go 
you gave up your apartment 
you have no money 
yeah  well 
i will figure something out 
  don t walk away from me 
  don t touch me 
we    don t    like    you 
duke 
hey 
thanks 
amanda comes back next tuesday 
she said it would be okay 
we re not allowed dogs here 
so keep him on the down low 
okay  thanks 
so i got rid of barry 
but trent didn t join our pack 
it didn t make any sense 
  wake up with
somebody near you     
it was just me and cj 
and we moved around a lot 
we went on a lot of walks 
every couple of days 
we were sleeping somewhere new 
but we never saw trent 
even when we knew where he was 
  watched the beard
crawl around on your face     
i stayed close to cj  but   
she still seemed sad 
  oh  the revolution was here  
  that would set you free
from those     
can you go get a cab 
  yeah  there s a few coming 
  max  come on  max 
    come on 
  trent 
max 
cj  what s wrong with you

in the guest bedroom
until you find your own place 
i m sorry 
i don t mean to be such a pain 
you re not being a pain 
i just need a little time
to get back on my feet 
um  trent 
can i speak with you
for a second 
okay 
hmm 
i guess that dog
doesn t know how to walk 
feel like maybe
i m getting you into trouble 
it s fine 
liesl can be a little jealous 
hey  is it okay if we sit down 
i m exhausted 
yeah  sure 
you okay 
yeah  yeah  just  uh   
think i m working too much 
  oh 
  excuse me 
so  trent tells me that you re
a professional dog walker 
what happened to you 
oh  yeah 
uh  just on the side 
um  music is what
i really care about 
oh  so you have a band 
nope  no band 
just me and my guitar 
  oh  where do you play 
  uh  well 
i haven t exactly
booked a gig yet 
kind of just been working
on my songs 
i wanted to have a whole set
before i started playing
in public 
oh  so  i mean 
music is on the side 
and dog walking is
your real job  then  right 
liesl didn t pee on anything 
but she was definitely
marking her territory 
ready for food here 
let s go  put the bowl down 
okay  okay 
ah  sit 
good boy 
oh  this is delicious 
best meal ever 
whoa  slow down  max 
i m done 
trent 
tough day 
not too bad 
think i just need some sleep 
  yeah  i bet 
  oh  hey  little guy 
i literally just had
the best meal of my life 
good to have trent back
in the pack 
can i say something
you may not want to hear 
sure 
i think you have stage fright 
wait  that smell 
i   
okay  fine 
maybe i have
a little stage fright 
but    well  i don t know 
maybe my songs
just aren t ready yet 
hmm  well   
i remember that smell
from when i was molly 
how will you know
whether they re ready
if you don t play them 
right 
oh 
that s a cute little trick 
i smelled the smell 
now i get a treat 
you see that 
wow 
trent  how long have you
been wiped out like this 
 wiped out  
um   
actually   
since i moved back from london 
i guess i m   
i m just jet lagged 
you    do you think maybe
you should see a doctor 
just to make sure
everything s okay 
you re changing the subject
from your musical career 
i am gonna think
about that  okay 
will you just please
go see a doctor 
  okay 
  excuse me 
you owe me a treat 
gloria  stop calling me 
  there s a girl     
come in 
hey  uh  liesl s here 
could you come out 
i want to tell you both
something 
sure 
and they re sure it s cancer 
they re sure 
what did they tell you
about treatment options 
well  the good news is  uh 
they caught it early 
but i ll have to do chemo 
do you have to go
to the hospital 
i hate hospitals 
they terrify me 
you know that 
then definitely
don t get cancer 
why are you laughing 
hey  hey  it was   
it was just a joke 
do you really think that this
is the time to joke 
i    i need some air 
it ll be okay 
thanks 
and what did she say 
she said she s not up
for being a nurse 
wow 
that is pretty cold 
ugh  sorry 
maybe it s for the better 
she d probably find some way of
making it about herself anyway 
hey 
you know you re gonna
beat this 
right 
definitely 
i i think 
i i still can t believe this 
well  i m not going anywhere 
thanks  cj 
everything s gonna be fine 
hmm 
they remind me of ethan and
hannah when they were young 
ooh  do they want
to lick each other 
hey  i got to go
to the hospital  max 
when i get back 
we ll go on a long walk  okay 
trent went away 
and then cj was gone a lot 
ah  stay  max 
why say  walk 
if you don t mean  walk  
trent came home 
and he slept a lot 
he slept even more than me 
thank you 
and i d been biting
at this itch for a long time 
boy  you re really chewing
that spot  aren t you 
maybe i should take you
to the vet 
okay 
so 
it s really good 
really 
no  it s horrible 
  here  i m gonna try it 
  uh   
oh  it s really bad 
trent wore clothes for outside
even though he always
stayed inside 
  it s healthy  tastes healthy 
  he looked ridiculous 
aw  i m sorry  max 
as soon as your leg heals 
we ll take it off  okay 
i don t know  max 
every time i think about
playing in public 
my heart just starts racing 
i don t know 
maybe i don t have
what it takes 
i wish this bed
was made out of bacon 
you accidentally
gave someone your key 
does life get
any better than this 
it s the doctor 
hi  dr  robbins 
mm hmm 
okay  so what does that mean 
okay 
thank you  will do 
what did she say 
sh sh she said my   
my scans were clean 
i m cancer free

well  if you don t try 
you ll never know 
so  what are you doing here 
gloria

if anybody ever needed a dog

something that loves you
like this  without conditions 
because you probably
really needed that 
yeah  i did 
so  clarity  i   
i have been sober for  um 
nine months and 13 days 
and   
i was not a good mother 
and i am s so sorry  clarity

really like to be
a part of your life 
i really want to trust you 
gloria 
i just don t know if i can 
so  it s your father s birthday
next week 
i don t know if you knew that 
um  and you are about
to turn the age
that he was when he died 
which is so crazy 
um   
i have some  uh 
letters from him
that he wrote to me
when i was pregnant   
with you 
um   
and your grandparents
gave them to me 
and i   
i think you should have them 
i was so angry when he died 
and    scared 
and i was just    lost 
but  um  i realize now
it is so important
that you know who he was 
because he was   
i don t want to read these 
gloria 
oh  yes  you do 
yeah 
just trust me
on that one thing 
and  um   
i know it it may take time 
i do hope that someday
you can forgive me 
turns out gloria s a
pretty good ear scratcher  too 
maybe there is hope for her 
after all 
the papers smelled
like hannah s boy 
they made me think of ethan
and hannah and the farm 
gloria  i miss you 
i think i m gonna get
the motorola job 
i saw an apartment
next to a park
that would be perfect
for the baby 
i know we re both scared 
but i finally have
some clarity 
we re so young  and we don t
know what we re doing 
but we have each other 
and we will figure it out
together 
we can spend the summer
with my mom and ethan
at the farm in michigan 
i know my mom will be
super helpful to us 
she is so excited
to be a grandmother 
i cannot wait to meet
our little girl 
how do you raise a child
to be strong and bold 
to believe in herself 
she ll have a good start
with you as her mom 
i have so many dreams for her and for us 
can t believe i m taking
my mother s advice  but   
   if i don t try it 
i ll never know  will i  max 
  will i 
  sometimes the best thing you can do
is just be there 
even if your ribs get
a little bit crushed
and it makes you want to go 
  all the times  
  i doubted myself  
  all these stories  
  that i couldn t tell  
  wouldn t stand  
  in front of a crowd  
  or say my thoughts too loud  
  but there s a fire
i m feeling  
  that burns me up  
  for once in my life  
  i m ready to jump  
  i m falling  fearless  
  no other way to do this  
   cause even when
i m crashing down  
  there is higher ground  
  i m falling  fearless  
  no other way to do this  
   cause even if
i m crashing down  
  i m in this moment now  
  i m falling  fearless   
  i don t want to steal
your freedom     
you re so great
