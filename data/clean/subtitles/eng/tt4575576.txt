the weather vane broke off
when the house fell
out of the tree

a heffalump and panicked
and then they all
flew out of the door
oh

about tiggers is
their tops are made
out of rubber
their bottoms are
made out of springs

very small donkey

creatures arent real
dont worry this is
part of the plan
careful we dont
want to fly out
we just need a leap of faith

oh wait for me
mr robin
come on
ooh that floor would be
good for bouncing whoohoo
oh youre back thank goodness
stop
i have the answer
this better be worth the wait
oh it is sir
because the answer to
all your problems
is nothing
nothing
nothing comes from
nothing robin
oh thats where youre wrong
doing nothing leads to
the very best something
i told you hes gone crackers
what happens when people
have time off work
nothing to do
they go on holiday
and what do people
need to go on holiday
luggage mr winslow
you employ thousands of people
all across your companies
and if you were to give
them all paid holidays
paid holidays
at the moment
you supply the wealthy
and no one else
do you see
but now look
if we all could afford
to go on holiday
up here
there would be hundreds
and thousands of
ordinary people
going to the countryside to
the lakes and beaches
all with their winslow luggage
and if we made the
prices cheaper
then everybody could
afford to buy them
oh great
our lovely beaches rammed
with hoi polloi
with their gramophones
and bottles of cider
now now hold on giles
father please this
is clearly codswallop
well you would say that
wouldnt you giles
and why is that
because youre a woozle
so thats what
a woozle looks like shh
what the devil is a woozle
a woozle is a slinking
little monster
who gets everyone else to
do his work for him
and hopes that we forget
whats important in our lives
our families
our dear friends
the people who love us
the people whom we love
were here to tell you
im here to tell you
that were not
afraid of heffalumps
and woozles anymore are we

lost his marbles
