they re always late 
i don t need to remind you 
we re under increasing
pressure to cut costs 
mr  robin  yes 
if we replace the
second inner bevel
with beechwood   
we can increase buoyancy
by four percent 
and decrease weight
by point two percent 
and cost 
oh  well  it might
save a few pennies 
oh  keep plugging
away  everyone 
bravo  that s what
we like to hear

there s no such thing
as heffalumps 
there s no such thing
as heffalumps 
there s no such   
look

to tell us then 
let s see 
looks like they were all here 
rabbit   
oh  someone was bouncing 
tigger  looks like a disaster 
why wasn t i invited 
so i think what happened is   
the weather vane broke off
when the house fell
out of the tree   
and started making that noise   
and they all thought it was
a heffalump and panicked 
and then they all   
flew out of the door 
oh 
look  haycorn shells  a
whole trail of them 
follow them and
we ll find piglet 
now that is   
i m sorry  old bean

out of rubber 
their bottoms are
made out of springs

about to be made for me

anyone s seen a bear
or a tigger or a
very small donkey

part of the plan 
careful  we don t
want to fly out

and then we could
all be together 
i saved a little bit 
sweetheart 
i was wrong about work 
i was wrong about everything   
and i m so sorry 
i ve been a father of
very little brain 
i lost myself  maddy

choose from now on 
all right 
oh  you gave us a real fright 
well  another
disastrous expotition

it all depends on how
you look at things 
mom  did you know that
we went to the train
and had a tea party 
darling  you re a genius 
oh 
come on 
oh  off we go again  righto 
come on  it s not too late 
oh  wait for me 
mr  robin 
come on 
ooh  that floor would be
good for bouncing  whoo hoo 
oh  you re back  thank goodness 
stop 
i have the answer 
this better be worth the wait 
oh  it is  sir 
because the answer to
all your problems   
is nothing 
nothing 
nothing comes from
nothing  robin 
oh  that s where you re wrong 
doing nothing leads to
the very best something 
i told you  he s gone crackers 
what happens when people
have time off work 
nothing to do 
they go on holiday 
and what do people
need to go on holiday 
luggage  mr  winslow 
you employ thousands of people
all across your companies   
and if you were to give
them all paid holidays   
paid holidays 
at the moment   
you supply the wealthy 
and no one else 
do you see 
but now look 
if we all could afford
to go on holiday   
up here   
there would be hundreds
and thousands of
ordinary people   
going to the countryside  to
the lakes  and beaches   
all with their winslow luggage 
and if we made the
prices cheaper   
then everybody could
afford to buy them 
oh  great 
our lovely beaches rammed
with hoi polloi   
with their gramophones
and bottles of cider 
now  now  hold on  giles 
father  please  this
is clearly codswallop 
well  you would say that 
wouldn t you  giles 
and why is that 
because you re a woozle 
so that s what
a woozle looks like  shh 
what the devil is a woozle 
a woozle is a slinking 
little monster   
who gets everyone else to
do his work for him   
and hopes that we forget
what s important in our lives 
our families 
our dear friends 
the people who love us 
the people whom we love 
we re here to tell you   
i m here to tell you   
that we re not
afraid of heffalumps
and woozles anymore  are we 
dear lord  he has
lost his marbles 
has he 
let s address the heffalump
in the room  shall we 
what were you doing
this weekend  giles 
what

a woozle before  son 
but by the sound of
it  you are one

on this immediately 
thank you very much  sir 
i look forward to it 
but first
