the only ball that means anything
that wins it is the nine
now the player can shoot
eight trick shots in a row
blow the nine and lose
on the other hand the player can
get the nine in on the break
if the balls spread right and win
which is to say that
luck plays a part in nineball
but for some players
luck itself is an art

l feel so doggone lonely
todayjust isnt my day
when l got home this morning
l found a letter on my bed
when l opened up that letter
l broke right down and cried
she said now daddy
l hate to leave you
but lm in love
with another guy
l couldnt believe she wrote it
so l read it over again
and when l was finished
the tears came down like rain
the more l read
this doggone letter
the more my
poor heart cries
she said now daddy
l hate to leave you
but lm in love
with another guy
my baby she said
