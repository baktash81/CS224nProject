from an article i read 
they dug up a mastodon
somewhere in siberia 
been in the ice for thousands of years
and the meat was still good 
mastodon 
well  what have you got to say for yourself 
this is my son  cal 
when you were his age 
i imagine you thought it only right   
   to let your father know
before you stayed out all night 
or at least to offer some kind
of apology when you did come home 
well  times change 
well  as i was saying 
a mastodon is a kind of elephant 
hasn t lived on the earth for a long while 
  and the meat was still fresh 
  sweet as a pork chop 
you re more excited about this
than you ve been for a long time 
now  i seem to be  don t i 
see  will  i ve been sort of
in a rut out there in the ranch 
  sixteen  17 years  i ve kept out of things 
  i know 
but now i feel that
if i could only do something   
   some little thing for  before i die 
some little thing for progress  uh   
   for people  maybe 
call it anything you want 
i might make up for all the years
i ve been lying fallow 
so lately i ve been reading up all i can
about refrigeration 
and i can t get it out of my head
that you can keep anything good   
   as long as you can get it cold enough 
like that mastodon there 
  good afternoon  abra 
  good afternoon  mr  trask 
  hello  mr  hamilton 
will  hello 
adam  hello  son 
aron  hi  dad 
now my son  uh  aron  that is 
thinks i may have a good idea here 
dad wrapped a head of lettuce
in wax paper   
   and kept it in our icebox
for over three weeks   
     and it still came out fresh and good  right 
  quite right  son 
  dad  is it all right if we look around 
  course  aron  belongs to us now 
do you know where the biggest market
for vegetables is in the winter 
will  where 
adam  new york city 
and they can t raise them there 
but the railroad had promised me
those fruit cars 
don t you have anything to say to me  cal 
  yeah 
adam  it s about time  well 
well  i read in the monterey newspaper   
   that if we get into this war   
   there are gonna be some fortunes made 
but you re gonna make them
in beans and corn  and stuff like that 
  you don t need all this ice 
  you re perfectly right 
beans are up to 3 cents 
you wanna make a profit  you plant beans 
and they keep too  don t they 
but i m not particularly interested
in making a profit  cal 
look here  will 
i m not an inventor nor a scientist   
   but i know i have an idea here 
will  i come from a family of inventors 
people full of ideas like this one 
i m the only one that didn t have an idea
and the only one that ever made a dime 
you wanna make a profit 
you plant beans 
put out that cigarette 
that place is full of sawdust 
  come on  adam  he s just thoughtless 
  thoughtless  he s inconsiderate 
i don t know 
i m at my rope s end with that boy 
i don t understand him  i never have 
aron i ve understood since he was a child 
abra

you don t remember your mother at all

adam 
cal  stop  stop that  cal 
what are you doing  stop it 
 blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven   
   whose sin is covered 
blessed is the man unto whom
the lord imputeth not iniquity   
   and in whose spirit there is no guile  
and you are forgiven  cal 
i think there is no iniquity
in your actions   
   only something i do not know 
why did you push that ice down 
cal 
i don t know 
was it    
was it vengeance  anger 
fear that i would punish you
for not coming home last night 
what was it 
i wanted to see it
slide down the chute 
  perhaps you had better read from here on 
  i ll read it  dad 
no  it s for cal to read 
start at the fifth verse 
verse 5 
 i acknowledge my sin unto thee 
and mine iniquity have i not hid 
i said  i will confess my transgressions
unto the lord   
   and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin  selah  
adam 
go on 
six 
and i suggest a little slower  cal 
and you don t have to read
the verse numbers 
 for this shall every one that is godly
pray unto thee 
and surely in the floods of great waters   
   they shall not come nigh unto him 
selah  
  seven 
  not the numbers  cal 
 thou art my hiding place 
thou shalt preserve me from trouble   
   thou shalt compass me about
with songs of deliverance  selah  
  eight 
  you have no repentance  you re bad 
through and through  bad 
aron 
excuse me  i ll go out and wait for abra 
 door closes 
cal  you re right  i am bad 
i knew that for a long time 
adam 
i didn t mean that  cal  i spoke in anger 
cal 
well  it s true 
aron s the good one 
i guess there s just a certain amount   
   of good and bad you get
from your parents   
     and i just got the bad 
  that s not true 
cal  listen to me 
you can make of yourself
anything you want 
it s up to you  a man has a choice 
that s where he s different from an animal 
you don t listen  you ll never remember 
my mother   
   she s not dead and gone to heaven   
   is she 
why do you ask that 
she s not dead at all 
she s not buried in the east

  pain 
if she    if she was still alive

i have no idea  she went east 
how do you know 
when she left the ranch we lived on
when you and aron were born   
   i heard she went east 
what was she like  was she bad 
i guess she   
i never really knew what she was like 
she wasn t like other people 
there was something she seemed to lack 
kindness  maybe  conscience 
i never knew what she was after 
  how come she left you 
  i never knew that either 
she was so full of hate 
  hate for you 
  for everything 
you won t tell aron that she didn t die

 man stops singing 
does adam know that you   
   roam around over here at night 
adam s an old friend of mine 
you know  cal  from   
   way back in his ranch days 
i was afraid when you moved here
last year   
   that you might find out something
about kate 
but then she was over here on the bay   
   and you were way over on the other side
of the mountains in salinas 
so i figured it d be all right 
you think he ll ever
find out about her 
he d never come over here 
here  you might as well look at this now 
it s a picture of your father
and your mother on their wedding day 
you re the first person
i ve ever showed it to 
cal 
i knew it 
 man resumes singing 
oh  i knew it was true 
when that old guy told me in the bar 
i knew it 
how did you know it was true 
because she ain t no good
and i ain t no good 
i knew there was a reason why i wasn t 
i hate her 
and i hate him too 
come on  i ll take you home

where she come from  really 
there were a lot of drifters in those days 
of all the people   
of all the people   
how come he married her 
you have no idea how pretty she was  cal 
young and full of spirit 
and your father hadn t been
off the ranch much  you know 
he s not a worldly man 
  did she shoot him 
  yes  she did 
how come 
i don t know 
did he do something to her 
  did he hurt her 
  no 
it wasn t in him to hurt her 
after she left him  he died 
he walked around  but he died 
he must have done something to hurt her 
no  no  sir 
he gave her everything
that any woman could ask for 
you see  your father has more kindness   
   and more conscience
than any man that i ve ever known 
he s a good man  cal 
don t sell him short  boy 
 adam humming

no  there were just some matters
i want to talk over with him 
what have you got there 
oh  well  i figured it would save some time 
so i   
it s very ingenious  cal  very ingenious 
did you think of it

i m very pleased
with the way you re taking hold   
   and are working so well  cal 
thanks  thanks  dad 
adam  think you better
have your lunch now  it s time 
hi  cal 
  aron s out in the field 
  i brought his lunch 
  well    okay  i ll take it to him 
  cal 
lydia  vamoose 
he ll be here in a minute 
i ve been fixing aron s lunch 
i ll fix yours too if you like after this 
no  thanks 
would you be eating with her
if i weren t here 
who 
no  i didn t ask her to come up here 
girls follow you around  don t they 
  does she bother you 
  she doesn t bother me 
who is she 
i never saw her before in my life 
 laughing 
i ll bet 
you re really working
at this lettuce business  aren t you  cal 
do you think it ll turn out all right 
your father will lose quite a lot of money
if it doesn t 
just about all he s got 
i like your father 
do you 
i threw away about  3 000 once 
yeah 
  when i was 13 
  you threw it away 
it was a diamond ring worth about that 
at least my father told me
that s what he paid for it 
i threw it in the river 
made dad terribly angry 
 abra laughs 
i reckon it would 
but i forgave him 
and it s been all right ever since 
  you forgave him 
  yes 
 laughs 
you forgave him because you threw
a ring of his worth  3 000 into the river 
  that s right 
  you forgave him 
that s right  ha ha ha 
is there an egg in this basket 
you see  i thought he didn t love me 
that made me feel awful 
girls love their fathers terribly 
do they 
my mother died when i was 13   
   and dad got married again soon after that 
did you know that 
no  i didn t know that 
  are you interested in hearing about me 
  yeah 
when dad got married again 
it made me sick 
i just hated everybody 
i used to sit and just glare at people   
   or i wouldn t even answer
when they spoke to me 
  why you telling me all this 
  i want to 
i was that way for months 
i just hated everybody 
and i thought nobody in the world loved me 
and it was awful 
then i found this ring
that dad gave my new mother   
     so i took it and threw it in the river 
  good 
 abra laughing 
i thought you d like that 
  did he ever find it 
  never 
 both laughing 
they tried 
what d they do to you 
dad punished me  not badly  i guess 
but i felt he shouldn t have
punished me at all 
i felt he should have loved me more
because i did it 
but he didn t 
isn t it funny 
i m grown up now   
   but i still understand kids
better than i do grownups 
you re not so grown up 
  i m very grown up 
  that s a matter of opinion 
i m very grown up 
more so than dad  because i forgave him
for not understanding 
and the minute i forgave him in my mind   
   i felt better 
now we get along fine 
we love each other 
not like we did when i was 13   
   but enough so we can live together
till i get married 
he s just my father now 
nothing to rave about 
i still don t like her much 
but then  she s a woman 
why  that girl just hates me  doesn t she 
you better tell her i m your brother s girl 
i don t have to explain anything
to anybody 
i ll go now and leave the field to her 
my  your hair s in a mess 
hey  dad  what s that

coal chute 
aron  okay  woman  where s the beans

made of wood 
  it ll save a lot of time 
  yes  sir

well  if it don t work  it ain t that kid s fault 
i never saw anybody work
so hard in my life 
let s go  pete  now  leonard 
 band playing fanfare 
good luck  adam 
 train whistle blowing 
do you know the principle
of the internal combustion engine 
no  i m afraid not 
will  i ll never be able to

oh  sure you will  you just listen to roy 
he s been to the automobile school
in chicago 
mr  trask has just revolutionized
the entire vegetable market 
  wait till those cars get to new york 
  don t you worry 
it s about time he owned
his own automobile   
   and about time he learned to drive it 
  now don t you think so  roy 
  i ll do my best 
well  now pay strict attention  boys 
 horn honking 
roy 
don t touch that 
wait till it s explained to you 
no  now for heaven s sake 
don t touch anything  anybody 
now  the power of the explosion
is exerted on a piston   
   and through connecting rod
and crankshaft   
   through transmission 
thence to rear wheels 
  got that so far 
  sure  he s got that 
now  we go on
to the operation of the automobile 
this here s the ignition key 
would you mind putting out
that cigarette  please 
turn this doohickey here to the left 
that puts her on battery 
  see where it says  bat  
  oh  yes  yes 
  bat  short for battery 
  that s right  good boy 
thank you  thank you very much 
first you gotta retard the spark

she ll probably kick your blasted arm off 
  oh  now remember that 
  now  this here is the spark 
you push her way up  listen 
 humming 
  this here s the gas  you push her   
  down 
  you had lessons before

  oh  you re a smart old buzzard 
  thank you very much 
  keep your eyes open  don t you 
  try to 
now  this here is the crank 
see this wire sticking out of the radiator 
that s the choke 
now watch careful 
grab hold of the crank like this 
push in till she catches 
see how my thumb is turned down 
i noticed that  why do you do that 
if you put her around this way
with my thumb around her   
   she d probably knock
my blasted thumb off 
oh  dear  dear  first you lose your blasted arm
and then you lose your blasted thumb 
  that s wrong way around 
  how s that 
he made a joke 
i never did see him so happy 
you pull out this choke 
turn her around to suck gas in 
then you give her a hard spin 
  she caught  first time 
  oh  caught on what

let s get out of here
before they start up that pianist again 
there must be some easier way
to stop the germans than this  anyway 
  i gotta make some money 
  sure  everybody s got to 
no  i gotta 
cal  remember  you said that
if you wanna make money   
   you ought to raise beans 
yeah  beans are up 3 5 cents now 
now  the way i figure it  it s like you said 
the country s gonna get into war  isn t it 
i don t see any way out 
  war s good for business 
  the best there is 
well  see  that s why i wanna go into beans 
see  i gotta get enough money
to give my father back what he lost 
oh  i see 
you think you can make
all that money back  huh 
i gotta 
you know  you re crazy

  five thousand dollars 
  mm 
it s a little different when you start
putting it into figures  isn t it 
yeah 
i know you wanna help your father   
   but a kid your age can t be expected
to put his hands on  5 000 
maybe if you could raise 100 or so 
we could let you have a little share 
no  i don t want a little share 
i want the whole thing 
  i ll get the 5 000 
  maybe if you and aron went in together   
aron ain t got nothing to do with this 
this is my deal  i ll get the 5 000 
what are you gonna do  borrow it 
yeah 
all right  if you can borrow  5 000   
   i know a farmer who s got over 800 acres 
  it s under cultivation 
  all right  what do we do 
if we can guarantee him 5 cents a pound   
   and make him a seed loan 
he ll plant beans 
so will a lot of other farmers 
why  we can contract
all the bean acreage you want 
 cal laughing 
that s it  that s it  that s great 
when do we start 
how do you know the price
is gonna go above 5  though 
did you read the newspapers
this morning 
we re apt to be in war any minute 
you know  i got a contract
with the british purchasing agency   
   and i got a friend in
the quartermaster corps 
do you know
that we could sell all the dry beans   
   that we can find
at 10 cents a pound or more 
that s what i want  that s it  see 
  how much will i make 
  oh  enough for what you want

he s bright 
what are you gonna do when you finish 
you re going to college 
maybe 
or back to some ranch 
no  i don t like the ranch 
well  you take after me 
makes me mad just to think about a ranch 
sit down 
thanks 
now  what do you want with  5 000 
i wanna go into business 
you re a little young for that 
aren t you 
i m old enough 
well  yeah  i guess you re right 
i guess you are 
  what kind of business do you wanna go into 
  beans 
see  beans are up to 3 5 cents now 
and we get into war 
they re gonna go up to 10  12 
  if we get into the war 
  that s a gamble you have to take 
  now  will hamilton says that   
  will 
you going into business
with will hamilton 
you see   
   my father  he lost about all he had in   
yeah  i know  i heard about that 
i wanna make enough to pay him back 
what s the matter with him 
can t he make any money 
yeah 
only   
only he s too good to bother
with money  huh 
okay 
what makes you think i d give you  5 000 
well  i don t know who else to ask 
you got a lot of nerve coming to me 
why  i didn t do anything to you 
well   
it s a good business venture 
and i ll pay you back  i ll give you interest 
you re a business woman  ain t you 
one of the best  son 
you know  sam told me that
you think i ought to be run out of town 
you re afraid that your father and aron
might find out about me  is that it 
this  5 000 now 
that wouldn t be
any kind of blackmail  would it 
  oh  i never thought about that 
  heh 
but now that you do  it s a good idea  huh 
 laughs 
  maybe 
  well  it s not 
anyway  i m not gonna hurt
your precious father or your brother 
  do they know anything about me 
  no 
father thinks you re in the east   
   and aron thinks you re dead 
well  then there s no reason to think
that they ever will find out about me 
we don t exactly move in the same circles 
what are you staring at 
how come you did it 
did what 
shot my father 
did he tell you that 
 laughs 
how come you ran away from all of us 
how come you shot him   
     ran away and did all that stuff 
  none of your business 
i shot him because he tried to stop me 
i could have killed him if i d wanted to 
but i didn t 
i just wanted him to let me go 
  why 
  because he tried to hold me 
he wanted to tie me down 
he wanted to keep me
on a stinking little ranch   
   away from everybody 
keep me all to himself 
well  nobody holds me 
  but he loved you 
  love 
he wanted to own me  he wanted to   
   bring me up like a snot nosed kid   
   and tell me what to do 
well  nobody tells me what to do 
always so right himself 
knowing everything 
reading the bible at me 
  what are you grinning at 
  nothing 
maybe you know what i m talking about  huh 
  ha  ha 
  always so right himself 
  yeah 
  yeah 
maybe like you said out there 
maybe you are more like me  huh 
yeah  you got sense 
maybe you don t fall for that slop
any more than i do 
maybe you know what people
are really like  what they want 
i got the toughest house on the coast   
   and the finest clientele  yeah 
half the stinking city hall go there 
they sneak in at night   
   and i walk in this front door
in the daytime  see 
and i built it up from nothing 
now you want  5 000 of my money   
   to go into business
to pay your father back what he lost 
you know  that s funny 
oh  well  i don t think
he ll know where i got it 
no  but it s funny just the same 
your father 
he s the purest man there is 
isn t he  oh   
he thought he had me all tied up
with his purity 
and now i give you  5 000
of the money that i made   
   to save him his purity 
 scoffs 
if you don t think that s funny 
you d better not go to college 
 kate sighing

he s a good businessman 
how d he ever happen to let you go
into this bean business  anyway 
i don t know 
i do  maybe he likes you

but it just seems to affect him
so personally 
man  three shots for a dime

the horrors committed by the germans 
abra 
look 
do we have time 
officer 
   after the germans had been through   
     the women of the town    
man  that german s here again 
it is not true  it is lies  all lies 
come on  cal  is it scary 
attendant 
here we go 
albrecht 
it is lies  all lies 
i d like to give that guy
a piece of my mind 
see over there  that s castroville 
everything looks so small 
 singing  higher and higher
and higher and higher
what 
growing and growing
and growing and growing
  what are you talking about 
  i ll tell you sometime 
cal  does aron really love me 
  um   
  i seem to have sort of lost him 
i mean  we re going
to be married someday  but   
well  if he does love me  he doesn t   
i can t tell anymore 
cal  can i ask you something 
yeah  go ahead 
these girls that you always
go around with 
you know  remember there was
that little mexican girl once 
what are girls like that like 
i mean  you don t really love them  do you 
well  then why do you go out with them 
is it because you re bad 
you re not angry  are you 
  well  why do you  then  are you bad  cal 
  do you think i m bad 
i don t know 
i guess i don t know
what is good and what s bad 
i mean  aron is so good   
   and i m not 
not good enough for aron  anyway 
because sometimes when i m with aron   
aron likes to talk about our being in love   
   and think about it
and that s all right  but   
these girls that you go out with  do    
maybe i don t know what love is exactly 
i know love is good the way aron says  but   
   well  it s more than that  it s got to be 
oh  i shouldn t talk to you this way  cal 
i shouldn t   
   but i don t know who else to talk to 
and sometimes i think i m really bad 
sometimes i don t know what to think 
  well  aron ll knock that out of you 
  will he 
he s got to 
the way i figure it out   
   aron never having had a mother   
   well  he s made her everything good
that he can think of   
   and that s what he thinks i am 
and that s who he s in love with 
it s not me at all 
because i m not a bit like that made up one 
not a bit 
i don t mean i think i m really bad 
look at that star 
it must be a planet  it s so bright 
probably 
i bet that girl s waiting for you
down there somewhere

she was pretty 
you ve been awfully nice  cal
