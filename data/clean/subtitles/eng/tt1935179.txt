bullshit
prettiest girl ive ever seen hands down

i tell you shes like a dream
you dont want to wake up from
shes got these birds tattooed
on her hands here
nightingales
good luck birds
that a good luck snake
no it is not
i hate snakes
thats because god put em
here for us to fear
we knew to be afraid of snakes long
before we ever even got into this world
the cherokee would wrap their pregnant
womens bellies in snake skin
induce labor scare the child out
put that around your bed at night
snake wont cross a braided rope
thanks
so whats that tattoo for then
a reminder
dont get bit
i was 10 swimmin about a mile
up from here me and juniper
son of a bitch
swam up on me
bit me right here up under the armpit
juniper got me off to the clinic
doctor said i should have
been dead in 20 minutes
took us over an hour just to get to town
so whatd they do for it
gave me the antivenom
cottonmouth
see here
thing with antivenom is
they can only give it to you once
made of horse blood
body would reject it a second time
so the cure becomes
more dangerous than the poison
what happens if you get bit again
i die
or just sweat it out
we gotta go help necks uncle

neck hows that line comin
if youre gonna do it do it
this shits crazy
one down
come on
wanna sit down
hey you must really like to fight
not really
you got a lot of friends
theyre all right
i dont know all of them
i bet youre pretty popular
why do you say that
because youre nice to people
how do you know that
youre nice to me
but i like you
i got you something
a bracelet
yeah
neckbones uncle finds them in the river
and collects the pearls and
i thought with your name and everything
thank you
you wanna be my girlfriend
youve been seeing mud
no
you dont have to lie to me boy
ive seen you running
around taking things
he all right
hes okay
he called you an assassin
how long have you known mud
a few days
thats long enough to
know hes full of shit
so its not true
i was a sharpshooter for awhile
in the marines in muds world thats an assassin
but its not exactly true right
yeah i guess
assassin
you think hes a badass dont you
i dont know
you know why hes stuck off on that island
yeah
he shot somebody
you know why he shot that man
cause he hurt juniper
right
the real reason muds in all
the trouble hes got is because of her
hes been in love with that girl
since he was your age
trouble is she dont care about nobody
but herself ive told him as much
shed bed down with the meanest snake
she could find
and then when things got bad
shed go runnin back to mud
hed take her back
then hed go find whatever unlucky
son of a bitch laid a hand on her
and beat him so bad
hed know never to touch her again
only this time i guess
he figured beatin wasnt good enough
he had to go shoot that feller
im not for sure but id put money on it
that she knew hed do it
she might even put him up to it
either way those two are set for failure
the only chance hes got
is to cut her loose
thatll never happen
but i tell you what muds no badass
hes runnin scared right now
ive got to go
youre wrong about juniper
they love each other
and theyre going to make it
if you werent such a worn out
old man youd know it was true

for bad luck
i dont know where this boats been
or what kind of person
the owner was before me

serious bad business left on it
we got too much ridin on this thing
to leave to chance
tom called me over
to his place this morning
what did he say
he was runnin down juniper
told him he was a worn out old man
and he couldnt know
how much you love her

you lie to me again
we thought it was junk
we didnt think it was worth anything
ellis
you tellin me i raised a thief
im not a thief
you take property thats not yours
property that belongs to another man
that junk was his livelihood
im ashamed of you
senior
shut your mouth
you think you can take things
and not have him see it
neither one of yous got any respect
for a mans livelihood
a life that puts clothes on your back
and food in your stomach
dont you blame this on me
one doesnt have a thing to do
with the other and you know it
you dont tell me what i know
if you can steal a mans life
out from under him
and think he wont take a lesson from that
then youre dumber than you look
stop it dad
and shes raisin you
a snake just like herself
and you can curl up beside her
before i give a goddamn
but you just remember this boy
you just remember when they come in here
and they tear this place apart
board by board you hear me
you are a man whos never had
the strength to support his own life
