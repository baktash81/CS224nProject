green beans never tasted so good

protection 
y all needn t be afraid of me 
i ve got two ways to protect myself
out here  this shirt

there are fierce powers
at work in the world  boys 
good  evil 
poor luck  best luck 
as men 
we ve got to take advantage where we can 
y all comin  
so who s this guy
you re waiting on 
i m not waitin  on no guy 
i m waitin  on my girlfriend 
  juniper 
  is she hot 
she s beautiful 
bullshit 
prettiest girl i ve ever seen  hands down 
blonde hair  long legs 
i tell you  she s like a dream
you don t want to wake up from 
she s got these birds tattooed
on her hands here 
nightingales 
good luck birds 
that a good luck snake 
no  it is not 
i hate snakes 
that s because god put  em
here for us to fear 
we knew to be afraid of snakes long
before we ever even got into this world 
the cherokee would wrap their pregnant
women s bellies in snake skin 
induce labor  scare the child out 
put that around your bed at night 
snake won t cross a braided rope 
thanks 
so what s that tattoo for then 
a reminder 
don t get bit 
i was 10  swimmin  about a mile
up from here  me and juniper 
son of a bitch
swam up on me 
bit me right here up under the armpit 
juniper got me off to the clinic 
doctor said i should have
been dead in 20 minutes 
took us over an hour just to get to town 
so what d they do for it 
gave me the anti venom 
cottonmouth 
see here 
thing with anti venom is 
they can only give it to you once 
made of horse blood 
body would reject it a second time 
so the cure becomes
more dangerous than the poison 
what happens if you get bit again 
i die
or just sweat it out 
we gotta go help neck s uncle

mud 
you can call me mud 
here  mud

sorry  boys  but i m going to have to go
back on our deal for the boat 
i don t feel good about it 
but i don t see any other way
out of what i m into 
so you know about the state troopers 
what state troopers 
the ones spreadin 
your picture all over the place 
stoppin  cars on the 165 
searching for your ass 
no  i don t know about that 
but it don t surprise me 
i got a lot of folks lookin  for me 
why 
i shot a man 
killed him 
i m sorry i didn t tell you boys sooner 
but i was hopin  to be long gone
before anything came of it 
didn t want y all involved 
look  y all been real good to me 
you re the only friends i got out here 
if troopers got 165 blocked  that means
they got other roads blocked  too 
so i ain t goin  to get nowhere in a car 
i want to try getting this boat down 
see if we can get it in the water 
see  with a boat like this 
i can make it to the gulf in two days 
heck  from there  i can get anywhere 
but i need a boat at least this big
to make it on the open water 
it s got no title  no owner 
nobody lookin  for it 
it s my best shot 
who d you kill 
just a bad piece of business 
y all don t need to hear about it 
i need to hear about it 
juniper  she

restaurants down in texas 
where were you 
i was around  but

this world and there are things you can t

a few days 
that s long enough to
know he s full of shit 
so  it s not true 
i was a sharpshooter for awhile
in the marines  in mud s world  that s an assassin 
but it s not exactly true  right 
yeah  i guess 
assassin 
you think he s a badass  don t you 
i don t know 
you know why he s stuck off on that island 
yeah 
he shot somebody 
you know why he shot that man 
 cause he hurt juniper 
right 
the real reason mud s in all
the trouble he s got is because of her 
he s been in love with that girl
since he was your age 
trouble is she don t care about nobody
but herself  i ve told him as much 
she d bed down with the meanest snake
she could find 
and then when things got bad 
she d go runnin  back to mud 
he d take her back 
then he d go find whatever unlucky
son of a bitch laid a hand on her
and beat him so bad
he d know never to touch her again 
only this time  i guess
he figured beatin  wasn t good enough 
he had to go shoot that feller 
i m not for sure  but i d put money on it
that she knew he d do it 
she might even put him up to it 
either way  those two are set for failure 
the only chance he s got
is to cut her loose 
that ll never happen 
but i tell you what  mud s no badass 
he s runnin  scared right now   
i ve got to go 
you re wrong about juniper 
they love each other
and they re going to make it 
if you weren t such a worn out
old man  you d know it was true 
what do you say  ellis 
i got more stuff 
yeah  did you find a motor 
not yet 
what s that 
bonfire s my all purpose cure all
for bad luck 
i don t know where this boat s been
or what kind of person
the owner was before me 
for all i know  there could be some
serious bad business left on it 
we got too much ridin  on this thing
to leave to chance 
tom called me over
to his place this morning 
what did he say 
he was runnin  down juniper 
told him he was a worn out old man 
and he couldn t know
how much you love her
