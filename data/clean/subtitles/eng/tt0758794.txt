lets go
nate nate ruffin
this our boys plane
this our boys plane
its so terrible
you didnt get my message
marshall university in west virginia
is in a state of shock today
following the terrible tragedy of last
saturday nights crash of a chartered airline
seventyfive people died in the wreckage
the football team the coaches
and some prominent residents
traveling with the team
these were beautiful young men
and its just a tragedy
that is beyond all comprehension
no one of us will ever
enter this stadium
without thoughts of them
and so our lord grant them
eternal rest and peace
which enables them
at this very moment
to look upon us here
and smile and be with us
this is our faith this is our hope
amen
those were not welcome days
we buried sons
brothers
mothers
fathers
fianc√©s
clocks ticked but time did not pass
the sun rose and the sun set
but the shadows remained
when once there was sound
now there was silence
what once was whole
now is shattered
have you mentioned this
to any of the other board members
a few most of them
would prefer not to think about it
i can understand that sentiment
it doesnt make sense to rush
right back into it you know
our coaching staff gone
our athletic department gone
so many of our boosters gone
wed have to start
all over again from scratch
my god we dont have the resources
or the manpower right now
i know all the reasons
to suspend the program paul
im just surprised to hear it
coming from you
this town just didnt lose
a football team don
we lost doctors lawyers
city councilmen
we lost fathers sons husbands
how many kids lost a parent
how many kids lost both parents
twentyeight
wouldnt be a game anymore don
be a weekly reminder of what weve lost
and i just dont see how that would
do anyone in this town any good
somebodys going to
have to tell them paul
all your scholarships will still be honored
boys its very important that
we take a collective breath as a town
and figure out the
proper course of action
and you think the proper course of action
is ending the program
i didnt say we were going to end the
program i said we are going to suspend it
look under the best of circumstances
it takes years to build a team
and well these are not
the best of circumstances
the ncaa will not let freshmen play
and they are the only players
we have besides you
when we do bring the program back we
want to make sure were able to do it right
if thats what you mean right
if they bring the program back
this aint right dr dedmon
it aint fair
i understand your position son
i will personally pass on your concerns to
the board before they make their decision
why cant i pass on
my concerns myself
well unfortunately board of governors
meetings are and always have been
closeddoor
come on
everybody up lets go come on
reggie put down the stick come on
i need yall to listen
now as of 15 minutes ago
we aint got football no more
if you gonna be marshall
you gonna be marshall right now

hi mr griffen
its good to see you
glad youre not giving up the booth
ive been coming here every day
for 30 years no reason to stop now
i think you should have this back
chris gave it to you
yeah he did
but you gave it to your wife first
and then you passed it down to him
so im passing it back up to you
it should stay in your family
what family
annie
you keep it
wear it and every morning
you put it on you think of him
don
red
what are you working on there
well i been promising carole
a new shed for a while now so
no time like the present i guess
red ive got an offer for you
i was afraid you might
mrs dawson if it had been me
i dont even know how id make it out
of bed in the morning
let him build a hundred sheds
hello this is president donald dedmon
weve decided to go ahead
with our football program next season
and your name was the first
on a list of potential candidates
for the head coaching position
well no i completely
understand i just
you were the first one
on my list so i
no no we decided
to bring the program back
yes it wasnt an easy decision
no thats totally understandable i
well thank you very much for
well taking the time
to at least talk with me about it
as ive been told
you had a great career at marshall and
yes thank you
no i understand
no i
please its
hey honey
you ever been to huntington before
mouth closed peter thank you
west virginia
no
why
just curious
hey peter
yeah
been quieter than i wouldve
guessed this morning
ernie salvatore called from the herald
says he wants to talk
if you have a moment
oh and there was another call
a jack lengyel called
from the college of wooster
says he may be interested
in the open coaching job
wooster
where in the world is wooster
does it really matter
okay now lets show dr dedmon
how its done here
run hard knees high play till
the whistle blows 17razor on three
on three 17razor
hut hut hut go go go
there he goes there he goes
oh first down
you see that oh yeah
is he all right
hey 32 are you all right
all right go kill your brother
now you see that point is
that tree wouldnt have been there
if you had a fullback blocking for him
and that is why im a fan
of the power i formation
well im sorry im afraid i havent the
faintest idea what a power i formation is
oh you dont
oh thank you dear
youre welcome
power i formation
is just your basic offensive scheme
put the fullback in front of the tailback
now frankly jack i dont care to know
actually im confident that im better off
not knowing what one is i think
well dr dedmon on that
we will have to agree to disagree
thank you
jack there is one thing i need to know
and please excuse me if i seem blunt
you are the first person ive interviewed
who is not an alumnus
and well since you called us
i have to ask what your angle is jack
youve got a great setup here
you have no ties to marshall
why do you want this job
who in their right mind
would volunteer for something
son dont put that in your mouth
no put it down thats right
its not an outrageous question i think
whats he gonna do
hes gonna put it in his pants
i bet he puts it in his pants
son dont put that in your pant sandy
i got it peter
im sorry excuse me
well i was just wondering if you had
given this any thought at all
before you asked me to drive 200 miles
out here to see you
a little bit yeah
little bit
well all right then
i have a long ride home
and i should be getting on with it
you thank your wife for the lovely dinner
are you sure okay
yes thank
thank you
say don
you wanna know why
i picked up the phone is that it
frankly i do
its not gonna be complicated
jack ive had four months of complicated
i just need honest
when i heard about
what had happened your situation
the only thing i could think about
was the four of them
i thought about how much
they mean to me
and about how bad it would hurt if
well if i was to lose them
then i thought about a team
and a school
and a town
thats gotta be hurting real bad
and i thought hell
maybe i can help
so i called you
yeah
i guess thats the only real why i got
right there
touchdown
ladies and gentlemen
please welcome the new head coach
of our thundering herd
jack lengyel
hi there
thank you
i am honored to be the new head
football coach here at marshall university
also would like to say a big thank you
from myself my wife and our three kids
we drove in from wooster last night
arrived at our new home here
electricity worked
the water pressure was high
there was a sixpack of beer in the fridge
and a pound cake on the counter
four for four
we appreciate the hospitality we really do
any questions
coach
yes sir
ernie salvatore heralddispatch
now realistically coach
what are your expectations for the season
well i can tell you this
if its a miracle youre looking for
well you should keep looking because
youre gonna end up disappointed
and im gonna end up out of a job
followup coach followup
one quick followup coach
what would you say to
the family members in the community
who feel that putting the team back
on that field might be disrespectful
i am a football coach
that is what i do
and thats why im here
i guess thats it
i have no idea
what kind of answer was that
how many clich√©s
are there any other questions
this guy wont make it
so this is my varsity team huh
there was four of us
but one of us aint here
so i guess its just three
okay
im coach jack lengyel guys
normally im bad with names
so the good news is
i may actually be able
to keep you fellas straight
nate is it
okay now hold on
while i commit this to memory nate
as in nate the great
date late escape wait nate
mcdrake
i got it locked
kid i went to grade school with
see thats a little wordassociation trick
i learned helps jog the recall
i read about it in redbook
and i tell you what it really works too
well were in this together now boys
im not going anywhere
and thats a promise
already got one name down
soon as the wife gets things
settled at the house
yall are coming over for supper
and ill get the other two
we are marshall
its a new day men
i like those boys don i do i do
the thing is im gonna need
55 more just like them
oh that i cant help you with im afraid
well actually you can don
you see i need you to petition
the ncaa for me
ask them to make an exception
allow us to play freshmen
now its the only chance we have
to get any edge on recruiting
much less put a full football team
on the field
i mean we are way behind here
well you know the ncaa
better than i do jack
theyre rigid as a board
they dont make exceptions
usually true
yeah
hey you know my son he crapped
his pants yesterday now hes 4
all right now my wife is out shopping
so i had to clean him up
she got home i told her what happened
she says i cant believe it
i said i cant believe it either
the kids 4 years old
he shouldnt be doing that shit
pun intended
you know what she says to me
she says jack no not that
i cant believe you finally
changed a diaper
what are you talking about
theres a first time for everything
hey i know you
in the middle yes i do
ask me your name go ahead
i wont even look ask me your name
whats my name
nate ruffin
team cocaptain eleven interceptions
in only seven games last year
redbook
stuff really works
hey we can do this doc
what are those 1 by5s
onebysixes
they dont look that wide from down here
saw you guys play once
did we win
it was the ashland game
well thatd be a no then
well you guys looked pretty good
till the fourth quarter
probably shouldve gone to the nickel
you know youre probably right
you know i appreciate you
coming out here to see me
but they already came out here to ask me
back and i already told them that im not
coming back so
yeah i heard i heard about that
just thought i could make you
a better offer
you know they asked you
to be the head coach
i want you to be the assistant coach
i think thats a demotion jack
well maybe
maybe not
i mean its the same duties
practically just less pay
same hours less responsibility
same team less pressure
i tell you red you know
the cupboard is pretty bare
and i could use some recruiting help
from someone who knows the area
you know carole and i
moved here two years ago it was
spring of 69
they had hired me as a receivers coach
but when i got here they told me
i was in charge of recruiting too so
that first year i went out
and i got us 20 kids
went to 20 homes
sat in 20 living rooms
and i promised 20 mothers
that id look after their sons
itd have been the class of 73
theres not one of them left
so let me ask you jack
how am i supposed to look a mother in the
eye and promise her anything ever again
i dont know red
i just dont think i could
take that field again jack
is that the ohio valley coal line
the same one that went off the tracks
near akron last winter
yep thats the one
back on track
well listen
if youre able to figure it out
doors always open
it was a pleasure meeting you red
nice meeting you
ill keep that defensivenickel
package idea in mind
for my fourth quarters in the future
maybe get a few more ws
onebysix huh
yup
same coverage less boards

we can run an offense
we can save a young mans life
come on now power i big on big
we got a huge problem
on the oline coach
i dont think its because
the defensive line is so spectacular
no no
men power i you know im a fan
of it thats why i brought it here
i have learned in the last two weeks
that it is not working
so as of right now the power i
goes in the trash
along with every fleaflicker
double reverse
and every other trick play
that you may have in your playbook
get rid of it
men it is time to simplify ball
so put our heads together here
what is the simplest offense
that you have ever run
and actually won a football game
any ideas a good idea no right or wrong
in here today men lets talk it out
well theres always the veer
the veer thats interesting
talk that out red
well the veers an option offense
spreads things out
takes the focus off any one man
its designed for teams that dont
have a strong offensive line
now that is us in a nutshell
well who runs it that we can talk to
bill yeoman came up with it
at houston
but other than west virginia
no one really runs it outside of texas
west virginia runs the veer

winning is everything
and nothing else matters
i mean ive said that
so many times myself
ive lost count you know
and it doesnt matter in what sport
and it doesnt matter what country
any coach whos worth a darn
in this business believes those words
fact
and then i came here
for the first time in my life
hell maybe for the first time
in the history of sports
suddenly its just not true anymore
at least not here not now no
you see
red it doesnt matter if we win
or if we lose
its not even about
how we play the game
what matters is that we play the game
that we take the field
that we suit up on saturdays
and we keep this program alive
we play the game red
and im telling you one day
not today not tomorrow
not this season
probably not next season either
but one day you and i are gonna wake up

for those of you who may not know
this is the final resting place
for six members
of the 1970 thundering herd
the plane crash that took their lives
was so severe so absolute
that their bodies were unable
to be identified
so they were buried here together
six players
six teammates
six sons of marshall
this is our past gentlemen
this is where we have been
this is how we got here
this is who we are
today
i wanna talk about our opponent
this afternoon
theyre bigger faster stronger
more experienced
and on paper theyre just better
and they know it too
but i wanna tell you something
that they dont know
they dont know your heart
i do ive seen it
you have shown it to me
you have shown this coaching staff
your teammates
you have shown yourselves
just exactly who you are in here
now when you take that field today
youve gotta lay
that heart on the line men
from the soles of your feet with every
ounce of blood youve got in your body
lay it on the line
until the final whistle blows
and if you do that
if you do that
we cannot lose
we may be behind on the scoreboard
at the end of the game
but if you play like that
we cannot be defeated
now we came here today to remember
six young men
and 69 others
who will not be on the field
with you today
but they will be watching
and you can bet your ass
that theyll be gritting their teeth
with every snap of that football
you understand me
how you play today
from this moment on
is how you
will be remembered
this is your opportunity
to rise from these ashes
and grab glory
we are
marshall
we are
marshall
we are
marshall
the funerals end today

but jack lengyel
has the marshall young thundering herd
a team of freshmen of transfer students
of walkons
a team of nobodies and no ones
somehow are beating the xavier pirates
after 30 minutes of football
well that is true
but i gotta believe that at some point
speed size and experience will prevail
come on booth
thats the way to start the second half
this young thundering herd looks like
theyre ready to play
44xpunch lets go

for a little while longer folks
but theres a complete pass to crawford
go go go
he breaks free
and hes in the end zone

of this marshall team
and with the extra point xavier has
taken the lead back from marshall

a field goal will not be enough
