and in this moment  once every year   
   throughout the town 
throughout the school   
   time stands still

no  stay back  stay up there  no 
  let s go 
  nate  nate ruffin 
this our boys  plane 
this our boys  plane  
it s so terrible 
you didn t get my message 
marshall university in west virginia
is in a state of shock today   
   following the terrible tragedy of last
saturday night s crash of a chartered airline 
seventy five people died in the wreckage 
the football team  the coaches   
   and some prominent residents
traveling with the team   
these were beautiful young men   
   and it s just a tragedy
that is beyond all comprehension 
no one of us will ever
enter this stadium   
   without thoughts of them 
and so  our lord  grant them
eternal rest and peace   
   which enables them
at this very moment   
   to look upon us here
and smile and be with us 
this is our faith  this is our hope 
amen 
those were not welcome days 
we buried sons   
   brothers   
   mothers   
   fathers   
   fianc√©s 
clocks ticked  but time did not pass 
the sun rose and the sun set 
but the shadows remained 
when once there was sound   
   now there was silence 
what once was whole   
   now is shattered 
have you mentioned this
to any of the other board members 
a few  most of them
would prefer not to think about it 
i can understand that sentiment 
it doesn t make sense to rush
right back into it  you know 
our coaching staff  gone 
our athletic department  gone 
so many of our boosters  gone 
we d have to start
all over again from scratch 
my god  we don t have the resources
or the manpower right now 
i know all the reasons
to suspend the program  paul 
i m just surprised to hear it
coming from you 
this town just didn t lose
a football team  don 
we lost doctors  lawyers 
city councilmen 
we lost fathers  sons  husbands 
how many kids lost a parent 
how many kids lost both parents 
  twenty eight 
  wouldn t be a game anymore  don 
be a weekly reminder of what we ve lost 
and i just don t see how that would
do anyone in this town any good 
somebody s going to
have to tell them  paul 
all your scholarships will still be honored 
boys  it s very important that
we take a collective breath  as a town   
   and figure out the
proper course of action 
and you think the proper course of action
is ending the program 
i didn t say we were going to end the
program  i said we are going to suspend it 
look  under the best of circumstances 
it takes years to build a team   
   and  well  these are not
the best of circumstances 
the ncaa will not let freshmen play   
   and they are the only players
we have besides you 
when we do bring the program back  we
want to make sure we re able to do it right 
if  that s what you mean  right 
if they bring the program back 
this ain t right  dr  dedmon 
it ain t fair 
i understand your position  son 
i will personally pass on your concerns to
the board before they make their decision 
why can t i pass on
my concerns myself 
well  unfortunately  board of governors 
meetings are and always have been   
   closed door 
come on 
everybody up  let s go  come on 
reggie  put down the stick  come on 
i need y all to listen 
now  as of 15 minutes ago 
we ain t got football no more 
if you gonna be marshall 
you gonna be marshall right now 
earn your stripes 
now  i want the two of you
to go with randy   
   and get every cheerleader and every girl
you can possibly find   
   and get them here at 5 00  the two
of y all  i need you to go with george   
   and find every cat in them frat houses
and get them here at 5 00 
go  now  go 
i need you on this one  reggie 
i need you  man 
find every person y all met
in freshman orientation   
   and i need them here at 5 00 
all right  come on  now  come on 
  five o clock 
  nate 
  yeah 
  come here a sec 
hey  i heard that some
of the guys are wavering 
  wavering 
  yeah  they re just kind of   
no  no  no  what you mean  what you
talking about  who s wavering  tom 
they don t feel it s the right thing to do
right now  step out on that field 
it s the only thing to do  tom 
this about our teammates  man 
now  i need to know
who you talking about 
no one  man 
five o clock  all right 
  yeah 
  yeah 
  you all right

why we re here today 
what i d like to do first

son  we do not have a team

athletic director  may he rest in peace

where to begin 
well  you can start with a coach  sir

hey  mr  boone 
annie  honey  come here

take some time for yourself 
the job will be waiting when you get back 
one thing i don t need
is more time for myself 
i just want things to get back to normal 
hi  mr  griffen 
it s good to see you 
glad you re not giving up the booth 
i ve been coming here every day
for 30 years  no reason to stop now 
i think you should have this back 
chris gave it to you 
yeah  he did 
but you gave it to your wife first 
and then you passed it down to him   
   so i m passing it back up to you 
it should stay in your family 
what family 
annie   
   you keep it 
wear it  and every morning
you put it on  you think of him 
  don 
  red 
what are you working on there 
well  i been promising carole
a new shed for a while now  so   
no time like the present  i guess 
red  i ve got an offer for you 
i was afraid you might 
mrs  dawson  if it had been me   
   i don t even know how i d make it out
of bed in the morning 
let him build a hundred sheds 
hello  this is president donald dedmon 
we ve decided to go ahead
with our football program next season   
   and your name was the first
on a list of potential candidates   
   for the head coaching position 
well  no  i completely
understand  i just   
you were the first one
on my list  so i   
no  no  we decided
to bring the program back 
yes  it wasn t an easy decision 
no  that s totally understandable  i   
well  thank you very much for   
   well  taking the time
to at least talk with me about it 
as i ve been told 
you had a great career at marshall and   
yes  thank you 
no  i understand 
no  i   
please  it s   
hey  honey 
you ever been to huntington before 
mouth closed  peter  thank you 
west virginia 
no 
why 
just curious 
  hey  peter 
  yeah 
been quieter than i would ve
guessed this morning 
ernie salvatore called from the herald 
says he wants to talk
if you have a moment 
oh  and there was another call 
a jack lengyel called
from the college of wooster 
says he may be interested
in the open coaching job 
wooster 
where in the world is wooster 
does it really matter 
okay  now  let s show dr  dedmon
how it s done here 
run hard  knees high  play till
the whistle blows  17 razor  on three 
on three  17 razor 
hut  hut  hut  go  go  go 
there he goes  there he goes 
oh  first down 
  you see that  oh  yeah 
  is he all right 
hey  32  are you all right 
all right  go kill your brother 
now  you see that  point is 
that tree wouldn t have been there   
   if you had a fullback blocking for him 
and that is why i m a fan
of the power i formation 
well  i m sorry  i m afraid i haven t the
faintest idea what a power i formation is 
oh  you don t 
oh  thank you  dear 
  you re welcome 
  power i formation   
   is just your basic offensive scheme 
put the fullback in front of the tailback 
now  frankly  jack  i don t care to know 
actually  i m confident that i m better off
not knowing what one is  i think 
well  dr  dedmon  on that 
we will have to agree to disagree 
thank you 
jack  there is one thing i need to know   
   and please excuse me if i seem blunt 
you are the first person i ve interviewed
who is not an alumnus 
and  well  since you called us   
   i have to ask what your angle is  jack 
you ve got a great setup here 
you have no ties to marshall 
why do you want this job 
who in their right mind
would volunteer for something    
son  don t put that in your mouth 
no  put it down  that s right 
  it s not an outrageous question  i think 
  what s he gonna do 
he s gonna put it in his pants 
i bet he puts it in his pants 
  son  don t put that in your pant   sandy 
  i got it  peter 
i m sorry  excuse me 
well  i was just wondering if you had
given this any thought at all   
   before you asked me to drive 200 miles
out here to see you 
a little bit  yeah 
little bit 
well  all right  then 
i have a long ride home   
   and i should be getting on with it 
you thank your wife for the lovely dinner 
  are you sure  okay 
  yes  thank  
thank you 
say  don 
you wanna know why
i picked up the phone  is that it 
frankly  i do 
  it s not gonna be complicated 
  jack  i ve had four months of complicated 
i just need honest 
when i heard about
what had happened  your situation   
   the only thing i could think about
was the four of them 
i thought about how much
they mean to me   
   and about how bad it would hurt if   
well  if i was to lose them 
then i thought about a team   
   and a school   
   and a town   
   that s gotta be hurting real bad 
and i thought  hell   
   maybe i can help 
so i called you 
yeah 
i guess that s the only real  why  i got 
right there 
touchdown 
ladies and gentlemen   
   please welcome the new head coach
of our thundering herd   
   jack lengyel 
hi there 
thank you 
i am honored to be the new head
football coach here at marshall university 
also would like to say a big thank you
from myself  my wife and our three kids 
we drove in from wooster last night 
arrived at our new home here 
electricity worked 
the water pressure was high 
there was a six pack of beer in the fridge
and a pound cake on the counter 
four for four 
we appreciate the hospitality  we really do 
any questions 
  coach 
  yes  sir 
ernie salvatore  herald dispatch 
now  realistically  coach 
what are your expectations for the season 
well  i can tell you this   
   if it s a miracle you re looking for   
   well  you should keep looking  because
you re gonna end up disappointed   
   and i m gonna end up out of a job 
follow up  coach  follow up 
one quick follow up  coach 
what would you say to
the family members in the community   
   who feel that putting the team back
on that field might be disrespectful 
i am a football coach 
that is what i do
and that s why i m here 
i guess that s it 
i have no idea 
what kind of answer was that 
how many clich√©s    
are there any other questions 
this guy won t make it 
so this is my varsity team  huh 
there was four of us   
   but one of us ain t here 
so i guess it s just three 
okay 
i m coach jack lengyel  guys 
normally  i m bad with names 
so the good news is   
   i may actually be able
to keep you fellas straight 
nate  is it 
okay  now  hold on
while i commit this to memory  nate 
as in nate the great 
date  late  escape  wait  nate 
mcdrake 
i got it  locked 
kid i went to grade school with 
see  that s a little word association trick
i learned  helps jog the recall 
i read about it in redbook 
and i tell you what  it really works  too 
well  we re in this together now  boys 
i m not going anywhere 
and that s a promise 
already got one name down 
soon as the wife gets things
settled at the house   
   y all are coming over for supper 
and i ll get the other two 
we are marshall 
it s a new day  men 
i like those boys  don  i do  i do 
the thing is  i m gonna need
55 more just like them 
oh  that i can t help you with  i m afraid 
well  actually  you can  don 
you see  i need you to petition
the ncaa for me 
ask them to make an exception 
allow us to play freshmen 
now  it s the only chance we have
to get any edge on recruiting   
   much less put a full football team
on the field 
i mean  we are way behind here 
well  you know the ncaa
better than i do  jack 
they re rigid as a board 
they don t make exceptions 
usually true 
yeah 
hey  you know  my son  he crapped
his pants yesterday  now  he s 4 
all right  now  my wife is out shopping 
so i had to clean him up 
she got home  i told her what happened 
she says   i can t believe it  
i said   i can t believe it either 
the kid s 4 years old   
   he shouldn t be doing that shit  
pun intended 
you know what she says to me 
she says   jack  no  not that 
i can t believe you finally
changed a diaper  
what are you talking about 
there s a first time for everything 
hey  i know you 
in the middle  yes  i do 
ask me your name  go ahead 
i won t even look  ask me your name 
  what s my name 
  nate ruffin 
team co captain  eleven interceptions
in only seven games last year 
redbook 
stuff really works 
hey  we can do this  doc 
what are those  1  by 5s 
one by sixes 
they don t look that wide from down here 
  saw you guys play once 
  did we win 
it was the ashland game 
well  that d be a no  then 
well  you guys looked pretty good
till the fourth quarter 
probably should ve gone to the nickel 
you know  you re probably right 
you know  i appreciate you
coming out here to see me   
   but they already came out here to ask me
back and i already told them that i m not   
     coming back  so   
  yeah  i heard  i heard about that 
just thought i could make you
a better offer 
you know  they asked you
to be the head coach 
i want you to be the assistant coach 
i think that s a demotion  jack 
well  maybe 
maybe not 
i mean  it s the same duties 
practically  just less pay 
same hours  less responsibility 
same team  less pressure 
i tell you  red  you know 
the cupboard is pretty bare 
and i could use some recruiting help
from someone who knows the area 
you know  carole and i
moved here two years ago  it was   
   spring of  69 
they had hired me as a receivers coach   
   but when i got here  they told me
i was in charge of recruiting too  so   
that first year i went out
and i got us 20 kids 
went to 20 homes 
sat in 20 living rooms 
and i promised 20 mothers
that i d look after their sons 
it d have been the class of  73 
there s not one of them left 
so let me ask you  jack 
how am i supposed to look a mother in the
eye and promise her anything ever again 
i don t know  red 
i just don t think i could
take that field again  jack 
is that the ohio valley coal line 
the same one that went off the tracks
near akron last winter 
yep  that s the one 
back on track 
well  listen 
if you re able to figure it out   
   door s always open 
it was a pleasure meeting you  red 
nice meeting you 
i ll keep that defensive nickel
package idea in mind   
   for my fourth quarters in the future 
maybe get a few more w s 
one by six  huh 
yup 
same coverage  less boards 
hey  tom 
guess we got us a coach  huh 
hey  look 
when they first roomed us together
freshman year  i wasn t too sure about you 
you know  but we stuck it out 
and now you re my best friend 
i mean  remember freshman two a days 
i m puking my guts out and
i wanna quit football and you won t let me

  red  what are my choices 
  dave walsh 
solid athlete  solid arm  solid kid

  jack  that s it 
  that s it  10 
that s it  coach 
all right  guys 
competition breeds improvement 
now  we need options here 
let s look around  keep our eyes open 
we need legs  hands and a decent arm 
right there  who s 86 
that s reggie oliver 
receiver from alabama 
bear bryant called me personally 
actually  to recommend him 
  you wanna try him out at qb 
  unless you think it s a bad idea 
  let s push them to the limit  men  huh 
  right  coach 
come on  hit it  now 
check 
not good  coach 
james  james  get over here 
that s supposed to be a post route 
  post 
  post 
you do know the difference between a
post route and a flag route 
no  coach 
all right  all right 
you see the big goalpost there 
that s why they call it a post route  post 
you head right to that post 
cut 10 yards  to the post 
see the big pylon down
at the corner of the end zone 
that s what we call a flag  all right 
so when you re running the flag route   
   10 yards to the corner of the end zone 
to the flag 
  all right  all right 
  i got it 
do it again 
come on  let s go 
nice speed  booth  nice speed 
nice speed  shalhoop  hey 
  what are you doing 
  oh  i kick the ball  coach 
but after you kick it  son 
you re still a football player 
good job  george  good job  george 
come here  come here 
  what s your name  51 
  my name s creole 
creole  this redbook s
taking me only so far 
urbanek  i need names  last names on
everyone s helmet  all right  this afternoon 
now  creole  the man outweighs you
by 75 pounds  okay 
when you re hitting him up high   
   he ll beat you and you ll be
on your ass every time  all right 
you gotta come in here 
you gotta get him low 
get him in the legs  okay  that s how
you ll keep him from coming through 
  stay low on him  low  man 
  what should i do if he goes low 
good question  george says 
what does he do if he goes low 
five one comes low 
head slap and you re around him 
like that  you see that 
head slap the shit out of him 
  give me second team  mcnally 
  we don t have a second team  jack 
shit  okay  yeah  we do
have a second team  jackson  urbanek 
lengyel  mcnally  dawson   
   line up here 
offensive line  watch this 
  coach  you don t have any pads on 
  now  you just play ball  olson 
quarterback s still standing 
big on big 
we can run an offense 
we can save a young man s life 
come on  now  power i  big on big 
we got a huge problem
on the o line  coach 
i don t think it s because
the defensive line is so spectacular 
no  no 
men  power i  you know i m a fan
of it  that s why i brought it here 
i have learned in the last two weeks
that it is not working 
so as of right now  the power i
goes in the trash   
   along with every flea flicker 
double reverse   
   and every other trick play
that you may have in your playbook 
get rid of it 
men  it is time to simplify  ball 
so put our heads together here 
what is the simplest offense   
   that you have ever run
and actually won a football game 
any idea s a good idea  no right or wrong
in here today  men  let s talk it out 
well  there s always the veer 
the veer  that s interesting 
talk that out  red 
well  the veer s an option offense 
spreads things out 
takes the focus off any one man 
it s designed for teams that don t
have a strong offensive line 
now  that is us in a nutshell 
well  who runs it that we can talk to 
bill yeoman came up with it
at houston   
   but other than west virginia 
no one really runs it outside of texas 
  west virginia runs the veer 
  yeah 
jack  that s crazy  we re rivals 
you think they ll invite us to lunch
and hand over their playbook 
they don t have to take us out to lunch 
we ll pick some up on the way 
morgantown  the veer  i like it 
eight time southern
conference champions  red 
jack  jack  i gotta tell you 
i really don t think this is your best idea 
  red  good to see you again 
  oh  coach

the veer this year

your bread and butter  as it were 
we re just hoping that we could
come down here and maybe   
   you could give us a few pointers 
  pointers 
  tips 
advice  anything that you d
be willing to show us

decisions until the last possible second 
give me that ball

oh  look at that hit 
every time he commits 
he gets the option to get the ball outside

   next week s first home game against
xavier university won t be any easier 
the xavier game will be the first
home game since the devastating crash   
   that killed 75 players and fans

shit  we re bringing the worst out in me 
and for what 
so that we can collect pity applause
in front of every college in the conference 
you didn t know rick tolley 
i did 
and on the day that he died  he said   
   the only thing that they judge us on 
the only thing that counts  is winning 
nothing else matters 
so  what do we do 
how are we honoring their memory 
we put together a team
that doesn t win  can t win 
not this week  not this season 
hell  maybe not ever 
we re not honoring them  jack 
we re disgracing them

why 
i don t know 
the board voted you out this morning 
what  may i ask why 
come on  don 
you were always a temporary solution 
you said it yourself after roland resigned 
you were just a band aid  remember 
is this about the football program  paul 
the crash just cut too damn deep  don 
it s not just the team that s bleeding 
it s not just the school 
it s the entire town 
do you have any idea
what it s like for annie right now 
she can t read the paper 
she can t watch the news 
she can t even go to work
without being reminded of football   
   which reminds her of the crash 
which reminds her of my dead son 
paul 
this isn t about football  is it 
and this isn t about annie 
and this isn t about the town  paul 
this is about the loss of your son 
and i m sorry 
but until you find the strength
to deal with that pain   
   nothing s going to get any better 
no matter how many presidents
you fire  paul 
just about closed  sorry 
my wife tells me you ve got
the best apple pie in huntington 
depends on the apple 
well  do you mind if i try 
hey  annie 
  annie cantrell 
  yeah 
  thank you 
  you re welcome 
mr  griffen 
i don t believe we ve been
formally introduced yet 
i m jack lengyel 
thank you 
i understand don dedmon
lost his job this week 
he s well qualified  he ll find a place 
you know  if you have a problem
with anything that happens on the field   
   blame me  not him  i m the coach here 
and what happens out there
is my responsibility  not his 
you re not from here 
you weren t here last november   
   so i don t expect you
to understand this 
this is not about what happened
on that field 
this is about what happened
to this town 
this is not a game 
i m real sorry about your son 
mr  griffen 
he was a hell of a running back 
i bet you were real proud 
please don t talk about him
like you knew him 
i was proud of him 
and i m still proud of him 
he was right  you know 
  who was right 
  your boy tolley 
winning is everything
and nothing else matters 
i mean  i ve said that
so many times myself   
   i ve lost count  you know 
and it doesn t matter in what sport 
and it doesn t matter what country   
   any coach who s worth a darn
in this business believes those words 
fact 
and then i came here 
for the first time in my life   
   hell  maybe for the first time
in the history of sports   
   suddenly  it s just not true anymore 
at least not here  not now  no 
you see   
   red  it doesn t matter if we win
or if we lose 
it s not even about
how we play the game 
what matters is that we play the game 
that we take the field 
that we suit up on saturdays   
   and we keep this program alive 
we play the game  red 
and i m telling you  one day   
   not today  not tomorrow 
not this season   
   probably not next season either 
but one day  you and i are gonna wake up   
   and suddenly we re gonna be like
every other team in every other sport   
   where winning is everything
and nothing else matters 
and when that day comes   
   well  that s when we ll honor them 
we ve got a team meeting
tomorrow morning  red 
got a little field trip planned
for the boys   
   and  well  we d love
to see you there  coach

for those of you who may not know   
   this is the final resting place
for six members   
   of the 1970 thundering herd 
the plane crash that took their lives
was so severe  so absolute   
   that their bodies were unable
to be identified 
so they were buried here  together 
six players   
   six teammates   
   six sons of marshall 
this is our past  gentlemen 
this is where we have been 
this is how we got here 
this is who we are   
   today 
i wanna talk about our opponent
this afternoon 
they re bigger  faster  stronger 
more experienced   
   and on paper  they re just better 
and they know it  too 
but i wanna tell you something
that they don t know 
they don t know your heart 
i do  i ve seen it 
you have shown it to me 
you have shown this coaching staff 
your teammates 
you have shown yourselves
just exactly who you are in here 
now  when you take that field today   
   you ve gotta lay
that heart on the line  men 
from the soles of your feet  with every
ounce of blood you ve got in your body   
   lay it on the line
until the final whistle blows 
and if you do that   
   if you do that   
   we cannot lose 
we may be behind on the scoreboard
at the end of the game   
   but if you play like that 
we cannot be defeated 
now  we came here today to remember   
   six young men   
   and 69 others   
   who will not be on the field
with you today 
but they will be watching 
and you can bet your ass   
   that they ll be gritting their teeth
with every snap of that football 
you understand me 
how you play today   
   from this moment on 
is how you   
   will be remembered 
this is your opportunity
to rise from these ashes   
   and grab glory 
  we are  
  marshall 
  we are  
  marshall 
  we are  
  marshall 
the funerals end today

marshall s kicking game was spotty at best
last week against morehead 
blake  come on 
let s see what lengyel
decides to do here 
we re kicking it 
let s go  we re kicking it 
this is an awfully long kick
for sophomore blake smith   
   a walk on from marshall s soccer team 
the kick is good 
hey 
  that s groovy  baby 
  that s groovy  baby 
i don t believe it 
the young thundering herd   
   has a 3 0 lead
as they take it into halftime 
hot damn 
he s liable to make that from 50 
good call 
stick around 
we ve got a dogfight on our hands   
   as xavier is certainly
a second half team 
  we are  
  marshall 
  we are  
  marshall 
damn it  coach  i said i m all right 
nate  you re sitting 
you can t do that  coach 
i gotta cover 19 
nineteen s got six catches

  yes  we do  yes  we do  nate 
but you ve done enough 
coach  i ve been going to my right
all day

  you ve done enough  nate

are we gonna be all right  coach 
yeah  we re gonna be all right 
yeah  we re gonna be all right 
thanks for joining us
back at halftime  folks 
you know what s hard to fathom 
it s hard to believe this is even possible   
   but jack lengyel
has the marshall young thundering herd   
   a team of freshmen  of transfer students 
of walk ons   
   a team of nobodies and no ones   
   somehow are beating the xavier pirates
after 30 minutes of football 
well  that is true 
but i gotta believe that  at some point   
   speed  size and experience will prevail 
come on  booth 
that s the way to start the second half 
this young thundering herd looks like
they re ready to play 
  44 x punch  let s go 
  break 
nineteen  set  hut 
  big hit on oliver   
  ball 
   who loses the ball  xavier scoops it up 
let s go 
he s on the 30   
   the 20   
   touchdown  xavier 
and just like that 
xavier takes the lead  6 3 
it s okay  come on 
  you re still the captain of this team 
  yes  sir 
i m gonna need you to be that captain
from the sideline 
set  hut 
  yeah  baby  let s go 
  come on  let s go 
  great call 
  all right 
twenty two 
all right  yeah 
it s your team now 
set  hut 
nice flag route by bill james 
he s got one foot inbounds 
that s good for a first down 
  yeah  come on 
  thought you were a basketball player 
if he doesn t pass  give it to wooch 
if he does  tuck it 
  tuck it and go 
  it s up to you  go 
oliver in with the play 
they re close  folks  very  very close 
just four yards
from a thundering herd score 
come on  reggie 
touchdown  reggie oliver 
and marshall grabs the lead right back 
9 6   
   with eight seconds remaining
in the third quarter 
let s go 
that s what it looks like on paper
right there  doesn t it 
if marshall can hold on
for a little while longer  folks  
but there s a complete pass to crawford 
go  go  go 
he breaks free 
and he s in the end zone 
touchdown  xavier 
oh  my  what a dagger to the heart
of this marshall team 
and with the extra point  xavier has
taken the lead back from marshall   
   13 9 with one minute left to play 
  we are  
  let s go  marshall  come on 
marshall has time
for one last ditch effort   
   but they ll have to march
all the way downfield into the end zone 
  a field goal will not be enough 
  thirteen  set  hut 
oliver breaks loose 
he s in the open field 
go  go  go 
something s happening here
for the thundering herd 
down  down  down  on the ball 
we got one time out  coach 
  i 13  i 13 
  run your offense  run your offense 
set  hut 
oliver holds the ball  rolls out 
and is sacked 
that s gonna be costly
as the clock keeps tick  
no  wait  he got rid of it 
he got rid of it 
a huge gain for the herd 
marshall marches upfield 
but with less than 30 seconds left   
     time is running out for the boys in green 
  time out  time out 
marshall calls their last time out 
come on  marshall
