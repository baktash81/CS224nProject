up a rival operation

east coast mob

  the sun rising  
  from the river  
  nature s miracle once more  
  will light the world  
  but this light  
  is not for those men  
  still lost in  
  an old black shadow  
  won t you help me to believe  
  that they will see  
  a day  
  a brighter day  
  when all the shadows  
  will fade away  
  that day i ll cry  
  that i believe  
  oh  my love  
  high above us  
  the sun now  
  embraces nature  
  and from nature  
  we should learn  
  that all can start again  
  as the stars must fade away  
  to give a bright new day

 panting 
rose  hello
