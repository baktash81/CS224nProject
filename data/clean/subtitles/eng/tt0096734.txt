wet cabin   
and wait for that neighbour
with the enormous head   
to get drunk and fall down 
he s a hydrocephalic  i don t think

nobody on the block has 
but i did talk to the real estate broad
that sold them the place 
apparently  their last house
only burnt to the ground 
  really 
  yep 
a hideous  raging inferno 
neighbours from hell 
maybe 
whatever it is  i m glad i m not
the one who lives right next door 
come on  let s face it 
these klopeks are strange 
i ve been watching that house
ever since they moved in 
no one goes in 
no one comes out 
no visitors 
no deliveries 
what do you think
they re eatin   ray 
well  maybe these people
just want to keep to themselves  art 
remember when the knapps
lived next door 
how many conversations did you
have with the knapps  i had two 
  oh  come on 
  they didn t even say goodbye
when they moved 
oh  please 
don t even compare the two 
at least 
if they weren t conversational   
the knapps were semi normal 
they worked in their yard  they mowed
their lawn  they had a lawn to mow 
these klopeks    we don t even know
how many of them there are 
there are three of them 
they only come out at night 
ricky butler says
they re nocturnal feeders 
oh  ricky butler says 
last week when i was up on the roof
with my telescope   
i saw them in their backyard 
  what were they doing  honey 
  digging 
  kind of like grave diggers 
  maybe 
all right  that s enough
of this conversation 
i want you to stop spying on the klopeks
with ricky butler 
and i d like you to stop filling
his head with such half cocked theories 
  where you goin  
  i m gonna change into my vacation togs 
are you done with your eggs 
i m gonna mix the zinnias in
with the rest of the flowers 
the man at the nursery said   
  boy  that really burns my ass 
  what 
 that old fart 
he s got the best lawn on the block 
and you know why 
because he trains his dog
to crap in my yard 
hey  mrs rumsfield

he d come over to your place 
well  he s busy now

which is kind of like
the gateway to hell

oh  well 
i was doing some thinking 
and  you know  being that their
last house burned down and all   
it s like  maybe 
somebody left the gate open 
it s them 
they re movin  around again 
it was a night just like this
that it happened 
what happened 
mr weingartner 
it was a long time ago 
hinkley hills was a lot smaller then 
safer too  you never had to lock
your doors  everybody knew everybody 
i must have been maybe
nine  ten years old 
  you know where the big mall is 
  yeah 
there used to be a big drugstore
on the corner there 
  it had a big soda fountain  remember 
  yeah 
the guy who ran it was a rotund guy 
had glasses 
his name was skip 
lived over on elm 
had a wife  a couple kids 
not too sharp 
the guy s 40 years old  he s wearing
a paper hat and making cherry cokes 
it s a cinch he s not
running for governor  right 
anyway  it got hot that summer 
it got real hot 
it was sweltering 
that heat where your underwear sweats
and it crawls up the   
anyway  it s hot  okay 
and they start smelling
this really vile stench over on elm   
and they figure it s comin 
from skip s place 
no one wants to say anything 
do you knock on the guy s door 
 hi  your house stinks  
so people are trying
to ignore it  right 
they re trying to pretend it isn t
happening  you know those pine things 
they re trying to cover up with those
pine things that you can put in cars 
people are hanging those
on their porches 
  oh  you think that s funny  ricky 
  well  yeah 
let me tell you
what happened next 
the state health inspector shows up 
they talk to skip 
he says he s got a sump pump problem 
they leave 
the guy s got a sewer problem 
he says he ll look after it 
everything s okay  right 
wrong 
a couple hours later   
there s smoke pouring out
of the windows of skip s house 
  the firemen go in  know what they find 
  what 
skip s family  dead 
murdered   
by skip    weeks earlier   
with an ice pick 
yeah  the guy killed
his whole family   
with an ice pick 
yeah  yeah  just put  em
in the cool basement   
covered  em up with a sheet and went
back to makin  treats for the townsfolk 
only skip didn t count on there
being a big heat wave that summer 
you know what all those people
were smelling on elm  ricky 
what 
skip s family s bodies   
decomposing in the summer heat 
apparently  one day skip made
just one too many lemon phosphates 
el snappo 
i remember that  i remember
hearing about that when i was a kid 
they they tore down
the soda fountain that fall 
these towns are full of those stories 
they re happening right under your nose 
you know  speaking of noses   
ever since this family
has moved to this block   
i ve been noticing
a weird kind of odour

you see the guy with the curly hair 
that s mr peterson 
he s this sceptic 
he s basically grounded in reality   
and he doesn t want to believe
his neighbours are up to
something strange 
 cause if they were 
he d have to deal with it 
okay  now see the fat guy 
that s mr weingartner 
he thinks the klopeks
are really evil   
and that they re building
a dungeon in their basement

snipers use it
for night visión 
what are we gonna do with it 
get a look in those
barred up basement windows

think we should go through with this 
are you a  fraidy cat 
no  i just think things
have gone off the deep end 
infrared night visión scopes  what
are we gonna do next  tap their phone 
that can be arranged 
then all we have to do is burn
a cross on their front lawn

a goddam cat over there 
  i m gonna go find out what exactly   
  get down  get down 
no headlights 
i can see the news report now 
 they were a quiet family 
kept pretty much to themselves 
no one would have ever
suspected them of foul play  
i ve never seen anybody drive
their garbage to the street   
and then bang the hell
out of it with a stick 
i ve never seen that 
i say we get a look
in those garbage cans 
call me overly cautious  but don t
you think that s a bit suspicious 
the three of us going through
their garbage at 11 00 at night
in the middle of a rainstorm 
affirmative 
that garbage is going nowhere 
i say we wait  til first light 
scope me

i m only trying to take a nap 
i m only laying here
with my eyes closed   
trying to get some goddam sleep 
quiet  quiet  quiet  i wouldn t wake you
if it wasn t important 
  i think we flushed  em out 
  okay 
the klopeks 
  rumsfield and i  we flushed  em out 
  how 
we wrote a note 
we slipped it under their door 
  we rang the bell  and then we ran 
  you did that 
  yeah 
  oh  geez  stupid idi   
i can t believe you   
all i did was write 
 i know what you ve done  
  i didn t sign it or anything 
  oh  i can t    you stupid   
  why didn t you    god 
  you gotta goose these people 
you gotta give them a little shot 
let  em know that you re there 
good dog  vince 
go get it 
here s the thing  art 
they re gonna think i did it 
  why 
  the old guy saw me write a note   
and put it under walter s door 
so they re gonna think
that i did it 
you wrote a note and put it under the   
i didn t know that 
it doesn t matter
 cause we got  em on the run now 
now they know that we know
that they know that we know 
yes  it does matter  you did it 
but they re gonna suspect me 
they re not gonna suspect anybody 
they re   
  do you know what this is 
  it s a bone 
  it s a femur 
  it s a femur bone 
a femur just happens to be
a human thigh bone  ray 
  wait  how do you know that 
  biology 101 
look at the size of this thing 
think this came off
a chicken or something 
where the hell did vince get this 
 he dug it up
from underneath the fence 
ray  ray 
there s no doubt any more 
this is real 
your neighbours are murdering people 
they re chopping  em up 
they re burying  em in their backyard 
ray  this is walter 
no 
there s just got to be
some other explanation for this 
it s just some litter 
the guy s a litterbug 
it could be a candy bar wrapper 
it could be a napkin 
it could be a crumpled up
credit card receipt 
those things blow around
all the time 
it  uh    no  it s my note 
  oh  oh  i m sorry 
  ouch 
i didn t see you 
i didn t see you

i think it s time we all stopped
acting like kindergartners 
  don t you  ray 
  yes  carol 
now  before somebody falls off a roof
or sets themselves on fire   
i think we should go over there 
knock on their door   
and invite ourselves in
for a nice  neighbourly chat 
get to know these people
like we should have done a month ago 
that s a good idea 
i ll make brownies 
  great  while you keep  em busy  l   
  you re not invited 
  can t we do this tomorrow  carol 
  would you relax 
we ll probably find out more
in five minutes of friendly chat   
than you guys can in a month
of snooping around

a doctor in the neighbourhood 
you know  i think it s great you ve been
able to stay with all the original wood 
i was never over here
when the knapps lived here 
how unfortunate for the knapps 
you know  it s funny  but i don t
remember seeing a moving van out front 
i don t understand that 
it was parked outside all day 
  really 
  s say  how is  uh   
the    drainage
on your property here 
i know when it rains at our house   
boy  the basement
just floods right over 
basement  ray comes up
with a winning idea 
maybe we should go
take a look in the basement 
maybe that was brother
down there   
tapping on the ceiling
a couple minutes ago 
who knows 
just what kind of doctor
is this brother of yours 
why don t you
ask him yourself 
ah  we have guests 
sort of 
my brother  the doctor 
werner klopek 
how nice to meet you 
ray peterson 
oh  pardon my glove 
i thought the candles
would be romantic    for the ladies 
  oh 
  they re lovely 
i really must apologize
for the paint 
i was just touching up
one of my pictures 
i find painting relaxes me 
  sugar substitute 
  no  thank you 
it was impolite of us not to have
introduced ourselves sooner 
i find my work is rather solitary 
it always keeps us on the move 
did you know we ve had to move
four times in as many years 
oh  all that moving must be
very hard on you  hans 
indeed 
and tomorrow   
tomorrow we must all go
to the university   
to discuss yet another transfer 
no  and we re just
getting to know you 
that s a shame 
isn t that a shame  honey 
that s a shame 
says who 
and i was just remarking   
to hans    today   
how nice it would be   
to meet all
of our new neighbours   
and here you are 
  actually  we re not all here 
  oh 
walter  the old man next door 
we don t know where the hell he is 
oh  god  jesus christ 
sorry  sorry  ow 
terrible thing 
the plight of the elderly 
we were just remarking
the other day   
about how an old guy like that   
could just drop off
the face of the earth without a sign 
vanish  no one ever see him again 
no trace  nothing 
right  ray  yesterday  wasn t it 
we werejust talking
about it yesterday 
i bet you were

a little participation here 
i think they re clean 
i think bonnie and carol are right

that s rich  considering you re
the one who started this whole thing

  honey  would you
and bonnie excuse us 
i think i should have a talk with
the boys in the den for a few minutes 
  okay

klopeks 
wow 
after the dog came up
out of the basement 
i found it wedged between
a bunch of magazines   
all of which

klopeks went back
inside walter s house   
and got the hair

they were going away tomorrow 
yeah 
as soon as that car leaves

no one knows how many trip alarms
they have in there 
no  i can take out everything
they ve got with one clip of the snips 
  right  captain 
  affirmative 
siren mode 
pretty neat  eh 
i can raise all the police channels   
and the power company channels
on this baby 
  be careful up there  art 
  it s okay  ray 
we gotta get going though 
we re burning daylight here 
hey  where should we start diggin 
once we get over there 
we start in the backyard 
then check the basement 
be careful up there

hey  safety is my middle name 
i thought his middle name was louis

of your own holes  huh 
i was just checking this one 
besides  the radio    i was monitoring   
this is turning out to be a lot more
work than we thought it was gonna be 
why don t we check the house 
it s probably a lot cooler in there 
that s a good idea 
let s try the house 
we ll start in the basement 
we ll start in the basement
and just work our way up 
 ray  i m thinking the reason we
didn t find anything in the backyard   
is because they probably weren t
burying anybody in the backyard 
they were digging bodies up and they
probably buried them in the basement 
that s a possibility  art 
i say we start in the kitchen  they
probably got some cold beer in there 
or some knockwurst or something 
i m starving 
it s locked 
  hey  give me a credit card 
  yeah 
  where did you learn how to do that 
  i don t know how to do this

of this furnace 
this thing s
got to be 80 years old 
these old places have got
to be hell to heat 
this house isn t that big 
what the hell does he need
a furnace like this for 
i think there s been some modifications
on this  cause this conduit s brand new 
it runs all the way back over there
and up through a hole in the ceiling 
i saw some of that
in their living room 
and a thermostat
on a home furnace   
is that supposed to go
to 5 000 degrees  do you think 
it must be what all the noise was 
look at all the stuff
they put together down here 
  they got this place
wired with batteries 
  there s got to be 40 of them 
look  we got power here 
this is no ordinary furnace 
what s that 
yo  rumsfield 
awesome 
mr rumsfield  are you okay 
  yes  yes  i m all right 
  that was very cool  man 
art  art  look 
  look  i found it 
  that s loose dirt 
they must have burned his body up
in the furnace   
and then buried his bones right here 
what do we do now 
i ll tell him that
they built a crematorium down here 
don t tell him that  he ll just want to
come down  wait  til we find something
