im taking the specimen
no i havent prepped
the chamber
i dont want him frozen
i want him soft
weve already discussed this
i had to go
over your head
im moving him
to our scranton facility
you cant risk taking him
through open country
this isnt open for discussion
his unique ability
to regenerate
iost and damaged tissue
it just cries out for more research
youll risk the deaths
of innocent civilians if he escapes
yes
but im sure sergeant marcus
and his men
can handle the transfer
just fine
sergeant
everythings under control maam
dr wimmer please
hes no longer your problem
can we get that rag off him
what the hell

i need you in lab two
you found something
two viables
in what condition
pertect were attempting reanimation
what can i do
you stoney and kinsa
theyll slow me down
just walk them through it okay
run a structural scan
and log them in
ill check back later
fine
okay where are we
boards all green the n2s ready
begin stabilizing
cell fractures
yes professor
i need a scan glycerol levels
cerebral profusion
the works
i live to serve
lets see what we have here
decrystalization of the membranes is
at 32 percent
somebody get her clothes off
i got it
i got it
honestly
wheres her diffusion barriers
seventeen and stable
here we go
stay still or youll get an elbow where

got who
no ones here
youre safe with us
there was a leak
in the cryounit and
was he contained
it was contained
but when the cryounit ruptured
you didnt escape it
it put you into stasis
for how long
the year is 2455
now i know this
is a huge shock
but youll be safe here
youre aboard grendel a classfour
catamaran transport ship
were on our way back home and
youll be just fine
thats over 400 years
secure line perez dieter
solaris research station
connect
lowe you bastard
weve hit the mother lode
do you know what time it is
i dont care
weve got a goldmine
a box of dvds
is not a goldmine
ive told you i cant move them
look at the file
two 400yearold frozen specimens
one wellpreserved
one wellpreserved
the other one are you ready
for this up and walking around
400 years old
and walking around
yeah 455 years
to be exact
who cares who gives a shit
people theyll pay huge money
to see her
let me ask you a question
is this the first person
youve reanimated
of course not
how many people
are out there today
walking around thawed out
and looking good
hundreds
thousands
maybe
but not 450 years old
shes nearly twice
as old as anyone
250 450
whats the difference
doctor
a hundred years ago when
reanimation was
more unpredictable
sure maybe
but now
its old news
damn it i need money
oh i know i know
the other viable
is marked voorhees
thats not jason voorhees
is it
what do you know about him
jason voorhees
he killed
nearly 200 people
and simply disappeared
without a trace
why to the right buyer
he could be worth a fortune
ive got him frozen here
on the ship
you work out a list
ofownership
no list hes my find
hes mine
what about your students
theyre students the educational
experience will be enough
doctor doctor
you are one son of a bitch
soon to be one rich son
of a bitch
lowe out
professor
i think that
we need to talk
about my midterm
poor baby no wonder
you wore this thing
harder harder
whos been a naughty little boy
i have
harder
a little harder hows that
yeah

you like it right there
yeah
a little harder for daddy
come on
come on
you pass

i like you just
the way you are
i think youre pertect
okay

help me no
no no
i brought you something
to eat
soon well be
at earth two
earth two what happened
to earth one
yeah well its dead
the oceans the soil
either will sustain life
can i do anything else
for you
you want to tell me
what happened
i take it being stabbed
and frozen
wasnt part of your plan
im a
i was a project leader
at crystal lake research
the subject
as jason voorhees
jason voorhees
notorious murderer
we executed him
for the first time in 2008
for the first time
we tried everything
electrocution
gas firing squad
we even hung him once
nothing worked
we couldnt terminate him
so we decided to contain him
cryogenic stasis
freeze him until we could figure
out what to do
seems sensible
i thought so
unfortunately some people who were
too smart for their own good
felt that a creature
that couldnt be killed was
too valuable
to file away
in the end it always
comes down to money
how do you thank someone
who gives you back your life
youll be alive for a long time
well figure out something
why dont you just admit it
you want me
i could never be with a girl whose
balls are bigger than mine

lab two
where did you get that
from your friend
with the hockey mask
you brought him
on board
hes in the next lab
were safe
safe
our scans reveal him
to be very dead
could your scans be wrong
get rid of him
hes too dangerous
that would be irresponsible
and foolhardy
hes a valuable scientific artifact
that must be carefully preserved
much like yourself
he is an unstoppable
killing machine
hes not dead
believe me
hes definitely dead
show me
im putting us
on lockdown
attention we have
a hostile on board
grunt team report to weapons
the chick
repeat we have
a hostile on board
grunt team report to weapons
everyone else get to lab one
baby im not ready yet
hurry up
grunt teams assembled
dallas is a noshow

lou
guys
weve lost
our entire port pontoon
the internal pressure is stable
the main
thrusters are offline
life support
we should be okay
for a while
but hes out there
well be fine
were in a highvolume traffic lane
another shipll come by
well be safe here
shut up
