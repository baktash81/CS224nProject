i m taking the specimen 
no  i haven t prepped
the chamber 
i don t want him frozen 
i want him soft 
we ve already discussed this 
i had to go
over your head 
i m moving him
to our scranton facility 
you can t risk taking him
through open country 
this isn t open for discussion 
his unique ability
to regenerate
iost and damaged tissue 
it just cries out for more research 
you ll risk the deaths
of innocent civilians if he escapes 
yes 
but i m sure sergeant marcus
and his men
can handle the transfer
just fine 
 sergeant 
 everything s under control  ma am 
 dr  wimmer  please 
 he s no longer your problem 
can we get that rag off him 
what the hell 
oh  my god 
get out of here 
what happened 
i m sorry 
cryogenic breach 
emergency lock down 
oh  god  no 
no 
kay em 
no viruses  no bacteria 
no toxins  it s clean 
 it s still cold 
 wow 
what is that 
it s like a big kind
kind of frozen storage thing 
probably a cryostasis unit 
i d guess
early port series 
quadroport 11 
manufactured in 2010 
precise historic records
are inconsistent 
anyone thinking
what i m thinking 
open it up 
 what the hell is that 
 humanoid 
organic composition
is unclear 
what s on his face 
some kind of 20th century
carbon filtration unit 
it s a hockey mask 
very good  tsunaron 
 what s a hockey mask 
 facial armor
used in a sport outlawed
in 2024 
amazing 
absolute museum quality 
are you paying attention 
azrael 
yeah 
well  don t touch anything 
guys 
we got another body here 
kay em 
she s pertectly preserved 
cell crystallization
is at 25 percent 
25 percent 
suggest nanotech and phase
one cell reconstruction 
wait    wait a minute  are you   
   are you saying that   
    we can bring her back to life 
 yes 
but she is deteriorating 
opening the door has compromised
her hibernation 
lou  get ready for dust off 
we have a priority evac 
copy that  ready in five 
not five  now 
what the    
look out 
55 cc s of etherene  you ll be fine 
fine  i m missing my arm

how d we get this screwed up gig 
i didn t join the corps
to be a babysitter 
 brodski 
 sarge  we found a viable

and get to lab two 
once we re in the clear  i d like
to check your circuits 
 i ll bet you would 
 it isn t like that 
i need you in lab two 
 you found something 
 two viables 
 in what condition 
 pertect  we re attempting reanimation 
 what can i do 
 you  stoney and kinsa   
 they ll slow me down 
  just walk them through it  okay 
run a structural scan
and log them in 
 i ll check back later 
 fine 
 okay  where are we 
 board s all green  the n 2 s ready 
begin stabilizing
 cell fractures 
 yes  professor 
i need a scan  glycerol levels 
cerebral profusion   
    the works 
 i live to serve 
 let s see what we have here 
decrystalization of the membranes is
at 32 percent 
 somebody get her clothes off 
 i got it 
i got it 
honestly 
where s her diffusion barriers 
seventeen and stable 
here we go 
stay still or you ll get an elbow where

subject discovered
in cryosuspension 
 how s it going 
 good  what s up 
 where do you want this 
 on the specimen table 
 hi  baby 
 hey  gorgeous 
initiating scan 
smart and sexy 
professor 
take a look at this guy s

like a mammoth 
get out of here and come back

 my pleasure  professor 
ready phase two 
bring on the ants 
that s it 
come to mama 
temperature  96 2

easy  easy 
vital signs are normal
and strong 
no shit 
easy 
easy 
did ya get him 
where is he 
tell me you got him 
got who 
no one s here 
you re safe with us 
there was a leak
in the cryo unit and   
was he contained 
it was contained 
but when the cryo unit ruptured 
you didn t escape it 
it put you into stasis 
for how long 
the year is 2455 
now  i know this
is a huge shock   
but you ll be safe here 
you re aboard grendel  a class four 
catamaran transport ship 
we re on our way back home and   
you ll be just fine 
2455 
that s over 400 years 
secure line  perez  dieter 
solaris research station 
connect 
lowe  you bastard 
we ve hit the mother lode 
do you know what time it is 
i don t care 
we ve got a goldmine 
a box of dvds
is not a goldmine 
i ve told you  i can t move them 
look at the file 
two 400 year old frozen specimens 
one well preserved   
one well preserved 
the other one  are you ready
for this  up and walking around 
400 years old
and walking around 
yeah  455 years 
to be exact 
who cares  who gives a shit 
people  they ll pay huge money
to see her 
let me ask you a question 
is this the first person
you ve reanimated 
of course not 
how many people
are out there today   
walking around thawed out
and looking good 
 hundreds 
 thousands 
maybe 
but not 450 years old 
she s nearly twice
as old as anyone 
250  450 
 what s the difference 
 doctor 
a hundred years ago  when
reanimation was   
more unpredictable   
sure  maybe 
but now   
it s old news 
damn it  i need money 
oh  i know  i know 
the other viable
is marked  voorhees  
that s not jason voorhees 
is it 
what do you know about him 
jason voorhees 
he killed
nearly 200 people   
and simply disappeared
without a trace 
why  to the right buyer
he could be worth a fortune 
i ve got him frozen here
on the ship 
you work out a list
ofownership 
no list  he s my find 
he s mine 
what about your students 
they re students  the educational
experience will be enough 
doctor  doctor 
you are one son of a bitch 
soon to be one rich son
of a bitch 
lowe out 
professor 
i think that   
we need to talk
about my midterm 
poor baby  no wonder
you wore this thing 
harder  harder 
 who s been a naughty little boy 
 i have 
harder 
 a little harder  how s that 
 yeah 
 oh  good 
 how s that 
yeah 
 daddy wants it hard 
 yeah 
 yeah  that s it 
 right there 
 you like it right there 
 yeah 
a little harder for daddy 
come on 
 come on 
 you pass 
what do you think 
 do you like them 
 they re fine 
look  kay em  i don t think
this is going to work 
 why do you want those things 
 janessa has them 
 well  janessa s   
 real 
yes 
let s not complicate things 
all right 
i like you just
the way you are 
i think you re pertect 
okay 
help  wayland  no 
somebody help 
help me  no 
no  no 
i brought you something
to eat 
soon we ll be
at earth two 
earth two  what happened
to earth one 
yeah  well  it s dead 
the oceans  the soil 
either will sustain life 
can i do anything else
for you 
you want to tell me
what happened 
i take it being stabbed
and frozen
 wasn t part of your plan 
 i m a   
i was a project leader
at crystal lake research 
the subject
as jason voorhees 
jason voorhees 
notorious murderer 
we executed him
for the first time in 2008 
for the first time 
we tried everything 
electrocution 
gas  firing squad 
we even hung him once 
nothing worked 
we couldn t terminate him 
so we decided to contain him 
cryogenic stasis 
freeze him until we could figure
out what to do 
seems sensible 
i thought so 
unfortunately some people who were
too smart for their own good   
felt that a creature
that couldn t be killed was 
too valuable
to file away 
in the end  it always
comes down to money 
how do you thank someone
who gives you back your life 
you ll be alive for a long time 
we ll figure out something 
why don t you just admit it 
you want me 
i could never be with a girl whose
balls are bigger than mine 
guys  our star patient is back 
tsunaron and janessa 
 hi 
 hi 
i see that my clothes
fit okay

where did you get that 
from your friend 
with the hockey mask 
you brought him
on board 
he s in the next lab 
we re safe 
safe 
our scans reveal him
to be very dead 
could your scans be wrong 
get rid of him 
he s too dangerous 
that would be irresponsible
and foolhardy 
he s a valuable scientific artifact
that must be carefully preserved 
much like yourself 
he is an unstoppable
killing machine 
he s not dead 
believe me 
he s definitely dead 
show me 
i m putting us
on lock down 
attention  we have
a hostile on board 
 grunt team  report to weapons 
 the chick 
repeat  we have
a hostile on board 
grunt team  report to weapons 
everyone else  get to lab one 
 baby  i m not ready yet 
 hurry up 
grunt team s assembled 
dallas is a no show

i told him to stay calm 
to wait until we got to solaris and
then we could take care of this   
monster 
i said

brodski was just too proud 
who locked the damn door 
somebody wants to tell me
what is going on 
grunts are dead 
 which ones 
 all of them 
oh  man 
lou  how long
till we reach solaris 
i m taking us out
of hyperdrive now 
kids and their goddamn
field trips  you know 
just bring a psycho on board 
i know i ll get blamed
for this shit 
solaris to grendel  we have you on
approach  stand by for docking number 
grendel to solaris  we need
military and medical at the gate 
we got a big problem here 
real goat fuck 
grendel  what s your problem 
what s your problem 
look   
we ll be all right 
he s trapped in the cargo bay 
we re locked in here 
can the solaris grunts
kill him 
absolutely 
i ve been in constant contact
with solaris 
sixty highly
trained professionals
are standing by to get us
off this ship 
solaris to grendel  pull up 
abort docking 
you re coming in too fast 
grendel   
what now 
 warning  prepare for impact 
 hang on

 it can t be gone 
 look  it s gone 
what are we going to do 
lou 
what sort of damage
we looking at 
i m sending out
a distress beacon 
 lou 
 guys   
we ve lost
our entire port pontoon 
 the internal pressure is stable 
 the main   
 thrusters are offline 
 life support 
we should be okay
for a while 
 but he s out there 
 we ll be fine 
we re in a high volume traffic lane 
another ship ll come by 
we ll be safe here 
shut up 
what are you doing 
maybe he gave up 
you really think so 
i don t think he s out there 
why don t you just stick your head
out and have a peek 
oh  my god  go  go 
janessa  go

so  you think we ll make it 
the statistical probability
of survival is 12 percent 
twelve percent  can t you come up
with better odds 
 no 
 bullshit  kay em  that s bullshit 
preparation for launch
may be a simple procedure 
but getting there alive 
it is a problem 
you telling me that there s
absolutely no chance
for us to better
our odds 
statistical probability of survival
just went up to   
fifty three percent 
want to go for a hundred 
he s here 
quiet 
but if he s in here 
he ll kill us   
quiet 
one more sound  and i ll snap
your neck myself
