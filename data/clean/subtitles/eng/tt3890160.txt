that was our boy
hes been boosting cars
since he was old enough
to see over the dash
he stole my mercedes
had a lot of merch in it
i watched him do it too
i didnt stop him though
cause i was just blinded
by the balls on that kid
course he didnt know
who i was
or the worth of the junk in
the trunk once he dumped it
but once i tracked him down i
made sure to tell him who i was
what i was capable of
and how much he owed me
and since hes
been paying me back
hes also shown me
what hes capable of
wow

a bread truck a ways away

hold all positions
you dont belong in this world
no
hands behind your back
do not move
im sorry
please leave him alone
how would you describe your
relationship with the defendant
we were friends
and i think we both wanted
to be more than that
he got himself into a bad spot
i was just
trying to get him out
i believe the defendant
is of good character
he didnt deserve
what happened to him
was the strangest thing
he finally drove off
and he threw
my purse right at me
then he actually said
im sorry
he looked at me and
he shook his head
like he was warning me somehow
telling me not to go inside
he looked concerned like he
was uh trying to save me
he made a mistake
when he was younger
and its haunted him ever since
when he tried to get out
he was pressured even harder
it was never his fault
hes got a good heart
always had always will
with regard to
counts 1 through 19
and count 21
i hereby sentence the defendant
to 25 years in
the federal penitentiary
subject to a parole hearing
after five years served
you got a letter kid
hey baby
you know its funny
even though i heard it so
many times in the court case
i still cant get used to the fact
that your real name is miles
its a cool name though
i can think of a lot
of great miles songs
but we still have to get through
all those baby songs first
i cant wait until
the day when its just us
