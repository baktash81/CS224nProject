the ghost that baited
cops doing 130 on 85 
headlights off 
brake lights disconnected 
he drove  em around in circles
on spaghetti junction 
left  em in the dust every time 
that was our boy there 
wasn t that  like  10 years ago 
yeah

that was our boy 
he s been boosting cars
since he was old enough
to see over the dash 
he stole my mercedes 
had a lot of merch in it 
i watched him do it  too 
i didn t stop him  though 
 cause i was just blinded
by the balls on that kid 
 course he didn t know
who i was 
or the worth of the junk in
the trunk once he dumped it 
but once i tracked him down  i
made sure to tell him who i was 
what i was capable of 
and how much he owed me 
and since he s
been paying me back 
he s also shown me
what he s capable of 
wow

long stay parking structure
at hartsfield jackson
to get a heist vehicle
that stays colder longer 
boost a commuter car 
a family car

hands behind your back 
do not move 
i m sorry 
please  leave him alone 
how would you describe your
relationship with the defendant 
we were friends 
and i think we both wanted
to be more than that 
he got himself into a bad spot 
i was just
trying to get him out 
i believe the defendant
is of good character 
he didn t deserve
what happened to him 
was the strangest thing 
he finally drove off 
and he threw
my purse right at me 
then he actually said 
 i m sorry  
he looked at me and
he shook his head 
like he was warning me  somehow
telling me not to go inside 
he looked concerned  like he
was  uh  trying to save me 
he made a mistake
when he was younger 
and it s haunted him ever since 
when he tried to get out 
he was pressured even harder 
it was never his fault 
he s got a good heart 
always had  always will 
with regard to
counts 1 through 19 
and count 21 
i hereby sentence the defendant
to 25 years in
the federal penitentiary 
subject to a parole hearing
after five years served 
you got a letter  kid 
hey  baby 
you know  it s funny 
even though i heard it so
many times in the court case 
i still can t get used to the fact
that your real name is miles 
it s a cool name  though 
i can think of a lot
of great miles songs 
but we still have to get through
all those baby songs first 
i can t wait until
the day when it s just us
