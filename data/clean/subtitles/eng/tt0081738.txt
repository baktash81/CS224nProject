ones she showed us yesterday 
isn t it rather isolated 
well  secluded  i d say 
  are you sure it wasn t  1 000 a week 
  quite sure 
  furnished 
  indeed 
  what s the catch 
  catch  mr curtis 
a bargain like that
wouldn t stay on the market 
maybe there s a ghost 
what self respecting english house
would be without one 
nonsense  the fact is mrs aylwood 
the owner  is a bit eccentric 
she has no family left
and she needs the income 
but she is quite sentimental about the house
and picky about who lives in it 
look around 
i ll nip to the cottage for the keys 
  is someone living there 
  mrs aylwood 
i expect that s why she wants to make sure
the tenants are the right sort of people 
if we live here  i m gonna climb this
and go exploring in those woods 
leave a trail of pebbles so i can grab you
before the wicked witch eats you up 
if she lives in a gingerbread house 
i ll eat it up  i m starved 
  what is it 
  mrs aylwood 
  i ve brought a lovely family to   
  you were told to notify me first 
  i tried to reach you by telephone 
  i haven t left the house all day 
mrs curtis writes charming children s books 
and mrs curtis is quite well known
in american musical circles 
pianist and composer  he s here
to conduct one of his own operas 
mrs aylwood  are you all right 
i ll get the keys 
they don t build houses like this any more 
what we need is a little light 
there s a large dining room
and the kitchen has full butler s pantry 
the living room is just beyond
the music room  this way 
that s a bit more cheery  isn t it 
how long before lunch 
you just had breakfast an hour ago 
when you said opera 
i thought he was a serious musician 
i have a very soft touch late at night 
come on  jan  let s go upstairs 
i want that room  it s really neat 
and you can look right out at the woods 
did you hurt yourself 
it s just a little cut 
i thought   
i thought i saw something
out there in the woods 
what sort of person are you 
it s hard to say  just    average  i guess 
are you adventurous    and kind 
are you kind 
i    try to be 
and sensitive 
do you sense things 
mrs aylwood  my husband would like
to talk about the details of the lease 
that is  if you ve decided to let us live here 
i m going to take a chance on you 
isn t this a pretty room 
  what was all that about 
  i don t know 
what happened to your hand 
i cut it on that window 
let s see 
  mom 
  what  darling 
  couldn t we keep looking 
  this place has everything we need 
  and the price is right  why don t you like it 
  i don t know 
the whole atmosphere  i guess 
i had such a funny  cold feeling
out by the woods 
like someone was watching me 
and then there s mrs aylwood   
and this house 
older people  when they live alone 
tend to be a bit unusual 
something awful happened here 
i can feel it 
something awful 
boy  mrs aylwood sure is creepy 
comforting to know
we re the right sort of people 
i ve seen the iciest of old ladies
melted by your charm 
  i think your daughter did the trick 
  me 
no  dear  not you 
she had a daughter  about your age 
  had 
  lost  many years ago 
  perhaps you reminded mrs aylwood of her 
  lost how 
i really don t know all the details 
just that she disappeared 
i believe the circumstances
were rather tragic 
she s going to stay here 
is that what you wanted 
let s see  gooseneck lamp
up here with the rest of my writing things 
mirror in the living room  please 
  jan  you didn t 
  i don t know what happened 
i wasn t even touching it 
mom  i couldn t see myself in it 
my reflection wasn t in it 
what 
i couldn t see myself in the mirror 
and then i saw   
i thought i saw    somebody else in it 
you know how old mirrors are  i never made
a move without something getting broken 
that s seven years  bad luck 
nonsense  i broke a mirror
the day i met your mother 
i m not sure that makes your point  darling 
it s ok  dad  i ll get it 
well  be careful 
boo 
  boy  are you ever jumpy 
  brat

i ever had  i may want to use it on you again 
  out 
  some people are no fun at all

  but what does it mean 
  you oughta know  you whispered it to me 
  i was talking to mike 
  well  i heard somebody say it 
i ve never seen you write like that 
ring up and mike will deliver what you need 
that s marvellous  when i m working  it s
hard to tear myself away from the typewriter 
he can pick things up for you in the village 
he s a good lad  my mike 
my strong right arm since his dad died 
i wanted him to stay at college  but   
mrs fleming  what s wrong

ellie  please 
ellie  why didn t you answer
when i called you 
i didn t hear you  and you shouldn t
sneak up like that  you scared me 
  i was yelling myself hoarse 
  i didn t hear 
  i asked you not to come into the woods 
  i had to  nerak ran off 
if i hadn t come after her 
she would have gotten lost 
isn t this a pretty place 
yeah 
yes  it is 
  that s a happy song 
  what 
the song you were just humming 
i wasn t humming anything 
come here  nerak 
  did you see that 
  see what 
all i can see is this vicious animal
trying to smother me 
  we should head back 
  tell that to nerak 
  i mean it  now 
  come back  you little   
jan 
  no 
  let go of me 
  stop  you re drowning her 
  let me go 
  stop 
  get out of my way 
she had to  she had to push you down
to get you loose from the branch 
she saved your life 
  i thought she was trying to drown you 
  ellie   
go and fetch some dry clothes
for your sister 
yes  ma am  come on  nerak 
dry your hair or you ll take a chill 
i don t know how to thank you for saving me 
what kind of name is that  nerak 
ellie just made that up 
it s the name karen spelled backwards 
what is it  what s wrong 
that was my daughter s name  karen 
mrs thayer told us
you d lost your daughter  i m sorry 
drink this 
  mrs aylwood 
  yes 
was anything wrong with karen s eyes 
why do you ask 
the night she disappeared   
was she blindfolded 
how do you know about the blindfold 
you asked me once if i sensed things 
well  i have  and ellie s been hearing things 
it s like someone is watching us 
  and the day we moved in  i saw something 
  what 
an image in a mirror 
a girl    about my age   
with long blonde hair 
and she was blindfolded 
  you saw her 
  i m not sure 
could you   
could you tell me what happened 
how she disappeared 
my husband was killed in the war 
and karen was everything to me 
she was soon to be 17 
and i stayed up late    finishing her present 
karen wasn t in her room 
she was always so considerate 
i couldn t believe
she d gone off without telling me 
then i remembered there was an eclipse 
she might have gone to watch it at the pond 
karen 
karen  where are you 
mary  john 
tom  tom colley 
karen 
karen 
karen 
they searched the ruins   
but there was no sign of karen 
no sign at all 
didn t the other kids
know what happened to her 
why was she blindfolded 
they said it was part of a game 
they used to meet in the chapel 
sometimes there seems to be
something out there 
sometimes    i hear someone
whispering in the wind 
mrs aylwood  what do you think
happened to karen 
i think she s still out there 
  what nonsense 
  i told you there was a ghost 
as long as it keeps out of the house 
i can live with it 
for heaven s sake  i knew mrs aylwood
was strange  but this is ridiculous 
i did see something in the mist at the pond 
that s why i fell in 
we ll always be grateful
to her for saving you 
but i won t have her filling your head
with these far fetched fantasies 
excuse me 
  i ll catch you later  i want to watch mike 
  ok 
she seems less moody today 
this is what she needs  it ll do her good 
knight on shining motorcycle 
  how many sandwiches do we have 
  four for me and one for you 
come on 
come on  mike 
  hi  guys 
  hi 
grab a sandwich
before your sister eats them all 
ellie  let s get closer 
well  be careful now 
  there he is 
  there s mike 
jan  come quick 
what is it 
quickly 
jan  quickly 
wow  did you see that 
  what did you want 
  i didn t want you  nerak did 
  it s lucky you moved off that rock 
  it wasn t luck 
  what do you mean 
  it s nothing  forget it 
  it s just been a crazy kind of week all round 
  do you want to talk about it 
mrs aylwood told me that karen 
her daughter  disappeared years ago 
when she was about my age 
and was never seen again 
if karen was murdered  that would explain
her haunting the woods  wouldn t it 
mrs aylwood said there were three kids
with karen that night 
one was john keller 
and there was a tom something  collier 
tom colley  he lives in the woods
in the old lodge  kind of a hermit 
and there was a girl  mary    mary pierce 
  mary pierce 
  yeah 
that was my mother s name
before she married dad 
it was a long time ago  it s best forgotten 
  how come you never told me 
  it happened years before you were born 
i remember your dad saying it s important
to live in the present and leave the past 
there s something about those woods
that bothers you 
you never go near them 
not even to take the short cut to the village 
across that rickety old bridge 
i should say not 
mum  what do you think
really happened to karen aylwood 
i think she ran away from home 
i don t know why she did 
but it s the only logical explanation 
what were the four of you doing 
we were just    just larking about 
it was john keller s idea 
it was    just a game 
then there was a    sudden summer storm 
lightning struck the belfry 
the whole thing was aflame 
we ran out 
at least    three of us did 
i ve never been back to that place again 
look what daddy made me
to watch the eclipse on saturday 
  i can show you how to make one 
  not now  mike s taking us riding 
i ll get ready 
  mom said she d only be a minute 
  that means ten 
  i wish you didn t have to go 
  so do i 
but if i don t  singers  dancers
and musicians will be unemployed 
  jan  i ll be back in time for supper 
  ok 
  see if you can find some peanut butter 
  crunchy or smooth 
  smooth 
  crunchy 
ok  i ll handle it  have a good ride 
  bye 
  bye 
  bye 
  bye 
good riding  ellie  ride ahead
and make sure the path s clear of indians 
it gets me out of the way so you two
can be alone  doesn t it  see you 
come on  come on  snowball  let s go 
i tried to talk to mum about karen 
she was very evasive 
she really didn t want to talk about it at all 
come on  you guys  hurry up 
let go back through the woods 
  no  mike  i don t think we should 
  oh  come on 
help  help me 
help  mike  help 
  stop  snowball 
  hang on 
cocoa  help 
mike  help 
stop  cocoa  stop 
cocoa 
anybody there 
is anyone in there 
mike 
are you ok 
  that man 
  it was tom colley  he didn t hurt you 
i saw karen s face again 
in the chapel  in a coffin 
it s only a reflection 
it couldn t have been my reflection 
i wasn t standing here 
i was back there  it was karen  her image 
she was lying in that coffin
as if she were dead 
i think i was sent here for a reason 
you were on a runaway horse 
he could have bolted in any direction 
he bolted because
something in the woods spooked him 
don t build it up into a   
mike 
what made the windows break 
the wind  it just came
blasting through the chapel 
but there wasn t any wind outside 
overlapping circles  what does it mean 
  can t we go now  jan 
  sure we can  ellie  come on  jan 
mike  there was a shadow of a triangle
on this coffin when i came in 
the same triangle
that s on the window in my bedroom 
these circles  they must mean something 
there was a circle
on the water at the pond  too 
it was strange 
i ve seen her  mr keller 
as god s my witness  i ve seen her 
  she was in the chapel  she was 
  you re drunk 
not then  i wasn t 
she was there  i tell you 
she come in and went right to the coffin
and looked inside 
  that s impossible 
  listen 
it s thundering 
there was thunder and lightning
that other night  the night we   
now  i ve told you
never to talk about that night 
all that time gone by  and her looking
like it was yesterday it happened 
  how could that be 
  get hold of yourself  man 
it s been nearly 30 years 
now  none of us could look the same 
could we 
there 
what was it i seen  then 
has she come back from the grave
to haunt us for what we done  mr keller 
is it the ghost of karen i seen 
works every time 
we should bring ellie 
it might curb her appetite 
  what took you so long 
  i saw her again 
  what are you talking about 
  in the mirrors 
she was reaching out  begging me 
pleading with me to help her 
  she s trapped and needs my help 
  oh  come on  jan 
  it means something  mike 
  you re not making sense 
there s something i ve got to do 
maybe she wants me to find out
what really happened that night 
  how 
  i don t know  but i ve got to find out 
stay 
didn t you see the signs 
this is private property 
mr keller  i had to see you 
it s about karen aylwood 
  what about karen aylwood 
  she needs help 
  how would you know that 
  i ve seen her 
  where 
  in mirrors 
mirrors  you see yourself as karen 
no  it was her image 
why was she blindfolded in the chapel 
i ve gotta know what happened that night 
why do you  you re a stranger here 
it s none of your business 
don t you see  she needs my help 
she s trapped somewhere   
that s enough  i ve better things to do
than listen to hysterical fantasies 
what happened to karen
was a tragedy that touched us all 
changed us all  but it s best forgotten 
  have you ever forgotten 
  get out of here 
  mr keller  please 
  i said  clear out 
tom colley 
tom colley 
please  don t be angry 
i didn t mean to come inside 
i called but nobody answered 
  you ain t no ghost 
  i m the girl you saw in the chapel 
you ain t karen come back to haunt us 
why would she do that 
can t talk about that 
mr keller  he said not to 
nasty poacher hurt its paw 
but old tom ll make it right 
like he did for you  eh 
nearly right now  ain t you 
not like them poor little ones there 
when i finds  em like that  dead 
i buries  em 
tom  was karen dead when you found her 
never found karen  looked and looked 
here  hold 
it won t hurt you none 
they know when you try to help 
  karen needs your help  tom 
  needs me 
yes  she needs you 
but karen s gone 
  tom  if you knew karen was trapped   
  awful things  traps  they hurt 
  you d set her free  wouldn t you 
  if i could find her 
you don t have to  tom  all you have to do
is tell me what happened in the chapel 
why did you blindfold her 
what was it you did 
you and mary pierce and john keller 
mr keller said mustn t talk about that 
  mary pierce said you were playing a game 
  she said 
yes  tom  what kind of game 
ring round the roses  it was 
never meant to harm karen 
loved karen  wouldn t ever hurt her 
there was three of us 
me and mary made our way
to the secret meeting place  the old chapel 
we had blindfolded karen 
that was what john keller had told us to do 
she was the new one  you see 
john keller was already in there 
you have been brought to this place to prove
yourself worthy of our secret society 
we number only three  we alone
have passed this test of courage 
many have tried and failed 
once we link hands  you must not show fear 
you must not speak  you must not remove
the blindfold  you must not move at all 
we shall hold hands around you and you
must not break the circle of our friendship 
whatever happens  whatever we say or do 
you must abide by our code 
banish all thoughts from your mind 
do you understand 
let us join hands   
   and concentrate 
mary pierce  tom colley and i  john keller 
we are looking upon you  karen aylwood 
willing you to be as one with us 
we ask the question  is this person worthy   
she wasn t there any more 
when the bell come down 
she was gone already 
  are you sure 
  i told  em what i seen 
 where could she have gone   they says 
there was no other way out 
and they looked and looked   
and never found nothin  
tom

ellie

from jan  she was humming it at the pond
the day she fell in the water 
come in  child  there s something
i want to show you  i think you ll like it 
  my mother said i was never to bother you 
  it s no bother 
come on  i was just about
to have some tea and cakes 
ok 
this belonged to my daughter 
i gave it to her on her fifth birthday 
she loved it 
she played it at night
before she went to sleep 
it s the same tune you heard at the pond 
listen 
your sister tells me you hear    other things 
voices that tell you to    do things 
i was just dreaming 
not when you named nerak 
she named herself 
listen  child  listen to the music 
see if you can hear that voice again 
  mrs aylwood 
  hi  jan 
look at the music box  isn t it pretty 
in a minute  ellie  i ve something to tell
mrs aylwood  i just came from tom colley s 
he said it was some kind
of initiation ceremony 
he said there was a flash of light 
just like you saw 
but when the bell crashed 
karen was already gone 
there was no other way out 
that s what tom colley said 
the bell crashed  karen was already gone 
karen  must help karen

  mom  i can t  i can t stop 
there s something i ve got to do 
or ellie and i ll go on being haunted 
whatever is out there

stop it this minute 
mom  i m scared 
whatever it is out there 
it s not going to use you  either of you 
not karen 
we ve got to hurry 
nearly too late 
  hardly ever happens 
  what hardly ever happens 
ellie  you said it hardly ever happens 
what does it mean 
i don t know  jan 
i can t remember 
 do again tomorrow  
do what 
i don t know 
i m scared 
good  you re up  mom said not to wake you 
seen my thing to watch the eclipse 
no 
dad says you can t look straight at the sun
or it ll ruin your eyes 
  i hope he gets here in time to see it 
  daddy s coming 
mom called him 
help me look  jan  it s nearly too late 
nearly too late 
here it is 
that s funny  i looked in there before 
we can all take turns using it 
it hardly ever happens 
hardly ever happens 
  what hardly ever happens 
  i just told you  the eclipse 
there are lots of moon eclipses 
but a sun eclipse is special 
what time does it start 
12 30  oh  rats 
when mike did this  it came out elephants 
not ring around the rosey 
ring round the roses  it was 
what s wrong 
nothing  tell mom i m going back to sleep 
  hello 
  you gotta do something for me 
  jan  what s wrong 
  i think i know what those circles meant 
  the overlapping ones meant an eclipse 
  there s an eclipse today 
and the circle at the pond
meant a circle of people 
i can t explain it all 
but i have to get keller  tom and your mom
to the chapel now before the eclipse 
i need your help  tell her anything 
say it s a matter of life or death 
jan 
where are you going 
i m going to the chapel with john keller 
tom colley and mary fleming 
i want them to repeat
the ceremony they held  linking hands 
like in a seance
when people make objects move 
  i think that s what happened to karen   
  no  you mustn t do that 
whatever happened to my karen
could happen to you 
mrs aylwood  i have to do it 
whatever is haunting ellie and me
will never leave us alone 
god be with you  child 
  karen aylwood s dead 
  how do you know that 
she never would have put her mother
through suffering 
part of the suffering is not knowing 
maybe we can find out what happened 
how she disappeared before the bell fell 
or how she died  if she died 
i told you before  it s none of your business 
mr keller  it was your idea  wasn t it 
the secret society 
the initiation ceremony 
don t you wanna know the truth 
who do you think you are to disrupt lives
and reopen old wounds 
they never really healed  did they 
isn t that why you lock yourself away
in that dreary house 
a prisoner of your own guilt 
mr keller  i don t have much time 
but you owe it to karen
and you owe it to yourself
to try to help make this happen 
  they should have been here by now 
  they won t come  not back to this place 
but they are  they re coming 
nerak  look   
nerak  get over here 
nerak  come back 
  i can t 
  you must 
we re running out of time 
we can t waste it arguing 
it may not work  mrs fleming 
but we must try 
we have to repeat the ceremony 
no  no 
whatever happened 30 years ago
was during an eclipse 
the same thing s happening now 
so maybe we can bring her back 
nerak 
nerak 
nerak 
nerak 
nerak 
nerak 
nerak 
don t do it  when karen did it  something
went wrong  she was never seen again 
the circle won t be broken this time 
no  no  no  we ran away once before
and we ve regretted it ever since 
  we must not run out again 
  the blindfold 
mr keller  i have to know exactly
what you said and did that night 
  i told karen   
  to me  mr keller  i m karen now 
  say it to me 
  very well 
once we link hands  you must not show fear 
you must not speak  you must not remove
the blindfold  you must not move at all 
we shall hold hands and you must not break
our circle of friendship 
  if anything happens to jan  i ll break it 
  don t interfere  move away 
we are looking upon you  karen aylwood 
willing you to be as one with us 
we ask the question  is this person worthy 
listen 
ready to return 
i have been trapped on your planet 
karen was my intervention 
we exchanged places by mistake 
magnetic pull of the eclipse
transferred our positions 
now exchange places again 
  almost time 
  ellie 
i must return home 
where s home 
what happened to karen 
continue  continue 
my power comes from you 
the three linked as before 
when darkness comes at noon 
  the eclipse 
  it s almost time  hurry 
go on with the ceremony  mr keller 
we ve gotta beat the eclipse 
come on 
we shall hold hands around you 
you must not break our circle of friendship 
with joined hands 
we call upon the powers of the universe
to grant us   
this is our chance 
don t break the circle 
mary  give me your hand 
must return home 
time s running out  hurry 
  hurry 
  but where is karen 
karen was in the way 
mistake  transferred by mistake 
in error we exchanged places 
karen s still in my dimension 
trapped and suspended 
must reverse the process 
concentrate 
exchange persons again  transfer back 
now  later too late 
now 
now  now 
  it s taking me 
  jan  you have to get out of that 
i can t 
jan  move  move 
break the ring  break it
