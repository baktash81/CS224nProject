what is he  today s edition 
another penguin sighting 
another penguin sighting  check it out 
penguin man living in gotham s sewers 
read all about the latest sighting 
may i have your attention  gotham city 
it is time for tonight s lighting of the tree 
how about that 
part man  part penguin  all horrifying 
find out for only 50 cents  come on 
read about the possible terror
beneath our feet  check it out 
read about it 
missing link between man and bird 
my dear boy   
   sometimes it s a diversion
to read such rubbish 
usually  it s a waste of time 
whatever  today s issue 
 the penguin  man or myth  
the globe  right here  25 cents 
well  here s hoping 
with luck  gotham will have its first
merry christmas in years 
i feel almost vulgar at yuletide   
   mentioning the new power plant 
but if we re to break ground
when we must  i ll need permits   
   variances  tax incentives 
that sort of pesky nonsense 
power plant 
studies show we ve enough power to get
us into the middle of the next century 
your analysts foresee growth
at 1  per annum  that s a mild swelling 
imagine   
   a gotham city   
   of the future  lit up like a blanket
of stars   
   but blinking on and off   
   embarrassingly low on juice 
frankly   
   i cringe  mr  mayor 
sorry  any plans must go
to the usual committees   
   through the usual channels 
i have a suggestion 
well   
   actually  really  just more like a question 
i m afraid we haven t
properly housebroken ms  kyle 
in the plus column  though   
   she makes great coffee 
dad 
mr  mayor  time to go down
and bring joy to the masses 
 actually  more of a question  
you stupid corn dog 
corn dog  corn dog 
i have enough signatures
from shreck employees to warrant a recall 
that s not a threat  just simple numbers 
maybe  but you sure as hell
don t have an issue or a candidate 
thank you  ladies and gentlemen 
from those of us at city hall
to each and every one of you   
    happy holidays 
we have with us a man who needs
no introduction  he s given us so much 
please welcome gotham s
own santa claus  max shreck 
pick up those contracts for personnel and   
   pick up the dry cleaning
and paper towels   
darn 
i forgot my speech 
remind me to take it out
on what s her name 
santa claus 
afraid not 
i m just a poor schmo  got lucky 
sue me   
    if i want to give some back 
i only wish i could hand out more
than just   
    expensive baubles 
i wish i could hand out world peace   
    and unconditional love   
    wrapped in a big bow 
oh  but you can 
oh  but you will 
merry christmas 
great idea 
not mine 
what are you waiting for  the signal 
we want the big guy 
the guy who runs the show 
what do you want 
not you 
shreck 
you ll have to go through me 
dad  go  save yourself 
dad  go 
shut up 
take one step closer  mr  manbat  and i ll   
you missed 
the batman 
or is it just  batman  
your choice  of course 
well  that was   
   very brief 
just like all the men in my life 
what men 
well   
   then again  there s you 
but you need therapy 
thanks for saving the day  batman 
the circus gang is back 
we ll see 
they almost made off with our mover
and shaker  max shreck 
where is that insufferable son of a bitch 
i believe the word you re looking for is   
actually  this is all just a bad dream 
you re at home in bed   
   heavily sedated  resting comfortably   
   dying from the carcinogens
you ve personally spewed   
   in a lifetime of profiteering 
tragic irony   
   or poetic justice 
you tell me 
my god  it s true 
penguin man of the sewer 
odd as it may seem  max   
   you and i have something in common 
we re both perceived as monsters 
but somehow   
   you re a well respected monster   
   and i am  to date   
   not 
frankly  i feel that s a bum rap 
i m a businessman 
tough  yes 
shrewd  okay  but that does not
make me a monster 
don t embarrass yourself  max 
i know all about you 
what you hide  i discover 
what you put in your toilet   
   i place on my mantle  get the picture 
is that supposed to hypnotize me 
no  just give you a splitting headache 
it s not working 
oh  you big baby 
just blanks 
would i go through all this trouble
just to kill you 
no  max 
i have an entirely other purpose 
i m ready  max 
i ve been down here too long 
it s time for me to ascend   
   to re emerge   
   with your help   
   your know how   
your savvy
i wasn t born in the sewer  you know 
i come from   
   like you 
and  like you  i want some respect 
a recognition of my basic humanity 
but most of all   
   i want to find out who i am   
   by finding my parents   
   learning my human name 
simple stuff that the good people
of gotham take for granted 
and   
   exactly why am i going to help you 
well   
let s start 
let s see what we have in here 
a batch of toxic waste   
   from your clean textile plant 
there s a whole lagoon of this crud
in the back 
it could have come from anywhere 
what about the documents that prove you
own half of the firetraps in gotham city 
if there were such documents   
   that s not an admission   
   they would ve been shredded 
good idea 
a lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference 
by the way   
   how s fred atkins  your old partner 
fred 
fred s actually   
i believe he s on an extended vacation 
he s good 
good 
hiya  max  remember me 
i m fred s hand 
want to greet any other body parts 
remember  max   
   you flush it  i flaunt it 
you know what  mr  penguin  sir 
i think  perhaps   
   i could help orchestrate
a  welcome home  scenario for you 
once we re both back home 
perhaps we could help each other 
you won t regret this  mr  shreck 
honey  i m home 
oh  i forgot  i m not married 
miss kitty 
back from more sexual escapades
you refuse to share 
not that i d ever pry 
drink your dinner 
what 
how can anyone be so pathetic 
yes  to you i seem pathetic 
but i m a working girl 
must pay the rent  maybe if you
chipped in instead of stepping out 
selina  dear  it s your mother 
just calling to say hello 
yeah  but   
but i m disappointed you re not
coming home for christmas 
i want to discuss why you insist
on languishing in gotham city   
    as some lowly secretary 
lowly assistant 
selina  about that christmas getaway
we planned   
i ll be going alone  dr  shaw says i need
to be my own person  not an appendage 
some appendage 
the party never stops
on selina kyle s answering machine 
i should ve let him win
that last racquetball game 
hello   
    selina kyle 
we re calling to tell you about exciting 
new gotham lady perfume 
it makes women feel like women   
and the men have no complaints either 
this is yourself reminding you to come
all the way back to the office   
      if you forgot the bruce wayne file   
  you stupid corn dog 
working late 
i m just boning up for your bruce wayne
meeting in the morning 
i pulled all the files
on the proposed power plant   
   and mr  wayne s hoped for investment 
i even opened the protected files   
how industrious 
how did you open the protected files 
may i ask 
i figured your password was  geraldo  
your chihuahua  and it was 
this is all very interesting 
though a bit on the technical side   
   about how the power plant
is a power plant in name only   
   since  in fact  it s going to be a big 
giant   
   big  giant    capacitor 
and  instead of generating power 
it ll be sucking power from   
   gotham city   
   and storing it   
   stockpiling it   
   which is a very novel approach  i d say 
who d you say this to 
nobody 
what did curiosity do to the cat 
i m no cat 
i m just an assistant 
a secretary 
and a very good one 
too good 
listen   
   it s our secret  honest 
how can you be so mean
to someone so meaningless 
this power plant   
   is my legacy  it s what i leave behind 
for chip 
nothing must prevent that 
go ahead  intimidate me 
bully me  if it makes you feel big 
it s not like you can kill me 
actually  it s a lot like that 
for a second  you really frightened me 
really 
honey  i m home 
oh  i forgot  i m not married 
selina  this is your mother  call me 
selina  this is your mother 
why haven t you called me back 
hello  selina kyle 
we re just calling to make sure
you ve tried gotham lady perfume 
one whiff of this and your boss
will ask you to stay after work   
    for a candlelight staff meeting for two 
gotham lady perfume 
exclusively at shreck s department store 
i don t know about you 
miss kitty  but i feel   
   so much yummier 
ladies and gentlemen 
i stand before you again to denounce
the urban chaos we live with in our city 
it s got to stop 
it s going to stop 
our community is coming apart   
    in a season when
it should be coming together 
i don t care what the cynics may say 
this is the christmas season   
    and should be a healing time 
i say that not only as an official   
    but as a husband and a father 
last night s violence won t happen again 
i m not good at speeches 
so i ll just say   thanks  
it s the hideous penguin man 
take the baby  just don t hurt me  please 
this was the remarkable scene
only minutes ago in gotham plaza 
the mysterious penguin saving the life
of the mayor s baby   
      and announcing his presence 
  all i want in return   
    is a chance   
    to find my mom and dad 
a chance to find out who they are   
    and thusly   
    who i am 
and then   
    with my parents   
    try to understand    why 
why they did what i guess
they felt they had to do   
    to a child   
    who was born   
    a little different 
a child   
    who spent his first christmas   
    and many since   
    in a sewer 
mr  wayne  something wrong 
his parents 
this scene  direct from gotham plaza 
i hope he finds them 
here he is  standing alongside
gotham s leading citizen  max shreck 
how about a statement 
people want to know 
  penguin s not to be disturbed 
  it s a public place 
  walk  now  move 
  freedom of the press 
wait a minute 
what about the freedom
to rediscover your roots   
   with dignity and privacy 
is the penguin a personal friend 
he s a personal friend of the whole city 
so have a heart 
give the constitution a rest 
it s christmas 
 red triangle circus put on
a swell show with fierce lions 
 circus returns for a two week   
 kids will love    
thanks 
it s cold 
it s vichyssoise 
it s supposed to be cold 
 circus is back with a freak show 
may not be suitable for kids   
    featuring a poodle lady   
    the world s fattest man   
    and aquatic bird boy  
why are you determined to prove   
   that this penguin is not what he seems 
must you be the only lonely  man beast 
in town 
 the circus folded its tents yesterday   
    after reports of missing children
in several towns 
 police have closed down
the red triangle fairgrounds 
 however  at least one
freak show performer vanished before   
    he could be questioned  
i suppose you feel better now 
no 
actually  i feel worse 
why re you still out 
are you concerned about that strange 
heroic penguin person 
i think he knows who his parents are 
there s something else 
mr  penguin   
a penguin is a bird that cannot fly 
i am a man 
i have a name 
oswald cobblepot 
you ll never be able to settle with them 
true 
i was their  number one  son   
   and they treated me like number two 
but it s human nature to fear   
   the unusual 
perhaps   
   when i held my   
   tiffany baby rattle   
   with a shiny flipper   
   instead of five chubby digits   
   they freaked 
but i forgive them 
 penguin forgives parents 
 i m at peace with myself and the world 
  don t need hands as long
as you got heart 
  my heart is filled with love 
i feel five feet tall   
  he s like a frog that became a prince 
  no  he s more like a penguin 
now  now  pretty little thing 
nice and easy 
i love a big  strong man who s not afraid
to show it with someone half his size 
be gentle  it s my first time 
tic tac toe 
you make it easy  don t you 
always waiting for some batman
to save you 
i am catwoman   
   hear me roar 
i d offer you coffee  but my assistant
is using her vacation time 
good time  everyone but the bandits ll
be slacking off till after the new year 
i m not sure i like the inference 
i didn t realize i made one 
i m pushing this power plant now
because it ll cost more later 
a million saved is a million earned 
i commissioned this report 
take a look at it 
gotham city has a power surplus 
i m sure you know that 
my question is 
what s your angle 
 power surplus   bruce  shame on you 
no such thing  one can never have
too much power 
if my life has a meaning 
that s the meaning 
i ll fight you  i ve already spoken
to the mayor and we agree 
mayors come and go 
blue bloods tire easily 
can you go 15 rounds
with muhammad shreck 
i guess we ll find out 
of course  i don t have a crime boss
like cobblepot in my corner 
 crime boss   shows what you know   
    mr  to the manor born 
with a silver spoon  
oswald is gotham s new golden boy 
if his parents hadn t 86 ed him 
you d have been bunkies at prep school 
he controls the red triangle gang 
i can t prove it yet  but we both   
i ll not stand for mud slinging here 
if my assistant was here 
she d have already escorted you out   
anywhere he wants 
preferably some nightspot grotto   
or
   secluded hideaway 
nice suit 
that s my name  don t wear it out
or i ll make you buy me a new one 
this is bruce   
   wayne 
we ve met 
have we 
no  i m sorry  i mistook me
for somebody else 
you mean   mistook me  
isn t that what i said 
i don t think so 
what happened 
did you hurt yourself    on that ski slope 
is that why you cut short your vacation 
came back 
it s a blur 
not complete amnesia  i remember
sister mary margaret puking in church   
   and betsy saying
it was morning sickness 
and the time i forgot to wear
my underpants to school   
   and the name of the boy who noticed
was ricky friedburg 
he s dead now 
but last night   
   complete blur 
couldn t you just die 
please   
   show out mr  wayne 
with pleasure 
your coat  mr  wayne 
you don t seem like the type
who does business with shreck 
no  you don t seem like the type
to take orders from him 
well  that s a   
   long story 
i could free up some time 
  i m listed 
  i m tempted 
i m working 
i m leaving 
you buy that blurry business 
women 
nothing surprises me   
   except your late mother 
who d have thought selina
had a brain to damage 
bottom line 
she tries to blackmail me 
i ll drop her out of a higher window 
meantime   
   l ve got badder fish to fry 
oswald   
   it s max 
you re home 
how ve you been 
your extended family 
good to have a family 
i d rather not be disturbed now 
come on downstairs  oswald 
i have a surprise 
i don t like surprises 
come on 
don t peek 
you ll spoil it 
adulation is a cross to bear 
god knows i know 
but someone s got to supplant our
standing in the way of progress  mayor 
and don t deny it  mr  cobblepot 
you ve got the magic 
your charisma s bigger than both of us 
come on down 
mayor 
mayor 
elections happen in november 
it s late december 
don t worry 
i want you to meet jen and josh 
my image consultants 
here 
reclaim your birthright 
i m jen 
okay  let s see  what i d like to do first
is put these gloves on you 
our research tells us
that voters like fingers 
so if we were to just lose this   
we ll do it another time 
not a lot of reflective surfaces
in the sewer  huh 
still  it could be worse 
my nose could be gushing blood 
what do you mean by that 
everybody  back to work 
let s make   
   a mayor 
you re right  we missed
the regular election   
   but elected officials can be recalled 
impeached   
   given the boot  look at nixon  agnew 
then think of you   
   oswald cobblepot  filling the void 
i d like to fill her void 
we ll need signatures to overturn
the ballot  i can supply those 
  teach her my french flipper trick 
  we need one more thing 
a platform 
stop global warming  start global cooling 
make the world an icebox 
i like it  but to get the mayor recalled 
we must have a catalyst 
 you re doing great  mayor cobblepot  
 your table is ready  mayor cobblepot  
 i need you  oswald  i need you now  
 that s the biggest parasol i ve ever seen  
soon an incident like the gulf of tonkin 
or the reichstag fire   
you want my old friends up there   
   to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy 
  exactly 
  sounds fun 
but   
   i mustn t get sidetracked  maxie 
i have my own things to tend to 
 sidetracked   this is your chance
to fulfill your destiny   
   that your parents carelessly discarded 
reclaim my birthright  you mean 
lmagine  as mayor 
you have the ear of the media   
   access to the captains of industry   
   unlimited poontang 
you drive a hard bargain  maxie 
all right  i ll be mayor 
burn  baby  burn 
  who is she 
  what is she 
i don t know whether to open fire
or fall in love 
you poor guys 
always confusing your pistols
with your privates 
don t hurt us  our take home s
less than  300 
you re overpaid  hit the road 
go ahead and hit me 
admiring your handiwork 
touring the riot scene 
gravely assessing the devastation 
 upstanding mayor  stuff 
you re not the mayor 
things change 
what do you want 
the direct approach 
i admire that in a man with a mask 
you don t really think you ll win  do you 
things change 
i saw her first  got to fly 
how could you  i m a woman 
i m sorry 
as i was saying  i m a woman
and can t be taken for granted 
life s a bitch  now so am i 
who are you 
who s the man behind the bat 
maybe you can help me find   
   the woman   
   behind the cat 
no  that s not you 
there you are 
saved by kitty litter 
bastard 
alfred   
   bring me some antiseptic ointment 
coming  are you in pain  sir 
not really 
i may have saved the mayor s baby   
   but i refuse to save a mayor   
   who stood by  helpless as a baby   
   while gotham was ravaged
by a disease   
   that turned eagle scouts
into crazed clowns   
   and happy homemakers into catwomen 
thank you 
oswald cobblepot  the mystery man beast 
made his bid to run gotham 
mr  cobblepot  you are the coolest
role model a young person could have 
and you re the hottest young person   
   a role model could have 
here 
wear a button 
let me just get it on here 
thank you 
this mayor stuff is not about power 
it s about reaching out to people   
   touching people  groping people 
  penguin   
  my name is not penguin 
it s oswald cobblepot 
oswald  there s somebody here to see you 
just the pussy i ve been looking for 
it s chilly in here 
i ll warm you 
down  oswald 
we need to talk 
you see   
   you and i have something in common 
sounds familiar 
appetite for destruction 
contempt for the czars of fashion 
wait  don t tell me 
naked sexual charisma 
batman 
the thorn in both our sides 
the fly in our ointment 
ointment 
i ve got scented and unscented 
i ll come back later 
perchance  are you a registered voter 
i m a mayoral prospect 
i have but one pet cause today 
ban the bat 
oh  him again  no bother 
he s already history  check it out 
we ll disassemble his batmobile
and turn it into an h bomb on wheels 
he d have even more power as a martyr 
to destroy batman  we must first
turn him into what he hates the most 
namely  us 
frame him 
not even in office yet
and already an enemies list 
those names are not for prying eyes 
why should i trust some catbroad anyway 
maybe you re a screwed up sorority chick
getting back at her daddy   
   for not buying her that pony
when she turned sweet sixteen 
nice birdie 
nice kitty 
nice kitty 
batman napalmed my arm 
he knocked me off a building just
when i started to feel good about myself 
i want to play an integral part
in his degradation 
a plan is forming 
i want in 
the thought of busting batman
makes me feel all   
   dirty 
maybe i ll just give myself a bath
right here 
i challenge the mayor   
    to re light the christmas tree
in gotham plaza tomorrow night 
sir  shall we change the channel
to a program with some dignity and class 
the love connection perhaps 
    not that i have any faith in the mayor 
but i hope and pray   
    that batman   
    will be present to preserve the peace 
subtle 
why are you doing this 
selina 
sorry  i didn t mean to scare you 
scare me  i was just scaring myself 
i don t see how  but   
it s nice to see you in the real world 
away from shreck 
it s nice to be here 
are you all right 
you look like you have the holiday blues
or something 
boy  the news these days 
weird 
i heard on tv that catwoman
weighs 140 pounds 
how do these hacks sleep at night 
it s not even accurate   batman blows it  
he probably saved millions
in property damage alone 
you re not going to the re lighting
of the tree  are you 
i wouldn t be caught dead there 
it s going to be a hot time
in the cold town tonight 
you got kind of a dark side  don t you 
no darker than yours 
why don t you come over
and we can watch it on tv 
the tree lighting ceremony 
i can t  i have to be somewhere tonight 
how about coming for dinner at five 
let s say six 
five 
five  you and me 
the tree lights up
and then i push the button 
wait  wait 
i push the button  then the tree lights up 
who are you 
talent scout 
come in 
i don t just light trees 
i m an actress as well 
what is that thing 
a camera or something 
say   cheese  
cheese 
thanks  alfred 
i m sure he s wonderful company   
   but doesn t the  gold plated bachelor  bit
get a little stale 
a lot like the  lonely secretary  syndrome 
i guess 
executive assistant 
sorry 
secretary 
any girlfriend 
sure 
you mean  as in serious 
no  had one  didn t work 
what went wrong  hang on 
i think i know 
you kept things from her 
i told her everything 
the truth frightened her 
there are two truths   
   you know 
she had trouble reconciling them
because i had trouble   
   reconciling them 
vicki thought   
vicki 
ice skater or stewardess 
no  she was a photojournalist 
was vicki right about your   
   difficulty with duality 
you see   
   if i say yes  then   
   you ll think of me as a   
   norman bates  a ted bundy type and   
you might not let me kiss you 
it s the so called normal guys
who always let you down 
sickos never scare me 
at least they re committed 
i can t do that 
neither can i 
this is a special bulletin 
the ice princess has been kidnapped 
can you confirm reports of batman s
suspected involvement in the abduction 
the evidence is purely circumstantial 
this was found  stained with blood 
in the missing girl s dressing room 
  i must go 
  no  it s your house 
hold on  just sit for a second and relax 
i ll be right back 
i ve got to go to the plaza 
  he is begging me to show 
  i hoped you d snub him 
i can t  there s been a kidnapping 
here s what i want you to do 
shit 
tell selina  ms  kyle 
i had to go out of town 
tell her that a big business deal came up   
you know what 
let her know  not in some kind of dumb 
 be my girlfriend  way   
i ll relay the message 
mr  wayne told me to tell you that   
bruce  yes   
would you tell him   
   l ve been going through   
a lot of changes and   
just that   
   this is not a rejection   
   my abruptly leaving 
in fact  he makes me feel the way   
   i hope i really am 
could you just make up a sonnet or   
a dirty limerick 
one has just sprung to mind 
this way  ma am 
ladies and gentlemen 
please  may i have your attention 
i know that to many of you   
    gotham seems a bit
beleaguered these days 
but i want you to know
your elected officials   
    and your police department   
    have the situation well in hand 
got to hurry 
thank you 
it was set up to look like i did it 
i ll tell the police i was kidnapped
by an ugly birdman with fish breath 
did somebody say fish 
i haven t been fed all day 
eat floor 
high fiber 
hey  stud   
   i thought we had something together 
  we do 
got to go  girl talk 
she let me go  i think  cause i reasoned
with her  girl to girl 
be careful  don t move 
lawn dart 
rats with wings  do your thing 
batman pushed the princess 
hold your fire 
you re catnip to a girl like me 
handsome  dazed   
   and to die for 
mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it 
but a kiss   
   can be even deadlier if you mean it 
you re the second man
who s killed me this week 
but i ve got seven lives left 
i tried to save you   
seems like every woman
you try to save ends up dead 
or deeply resentful 
maybe you should retire 
damn 
outstanding 
you re beauty and the beast   
   in one luscious christmas gift pack 
you said you d scare the ice princess 
she looked pretty scared to me 
a touch of the bubbly 
so what are we waiting for 
let s consummate our fiendish union 
what 
oh  come on 
can t you picture 
it s dark in the mayor s mansion 
i m bushed  so here you come
into the bedroom   
   twitching your little tail   
   my slippers in one hand 
a dry martini in the other 
please 
i wouldn t touch you to scratch you 
you lousy minx  i should have you spayed 
you sent out all the signals 
i don t think i like you anymore 
good bye  my unintended 
go to heaven 
there he is 
don t adjust your sets 
welcome   
    to the oswald cobblepot
school of driving 
gentlemen  start your screaming 
this may be a bad time to mention it 
but my license has expired 
relax 
i ll take care of the squealing  wretched 
pinhead puppets of gotham 
you must admit i played this stinking city
like a harp from hell 
helpless old lady at 12 00 high 
that s funny 
now i m a little worried 
so he survived  why worry 
he didn t even lose a limb 
an eyeball  bladder control 
listen to them  they ve lost faith
in old symbols 
they re ready to bond with you 
the icon of the future 
if it works  don t fix it 
we ll celebrate tonight at my annual ball 
shreck and cobblepot   
   the visionary alliance 
when it came time   
    to ensure the safety of our fair city   
    did the mayor have a plan 
no 
he relied on a man 
a batman 
a ticking time bomb of a costumed freak   
our prime concern is
this ghastly grotesque 
but let s not forget about
repairing the batmobile 
there s security to consider 
we can t just take it to any old body shop 
security 
who let vicki vale into the batcave 
i m working  i turn around and there she is 
 hi  vick  come on in  
  ready 
  i ll take the stairs 
you ask    am i up here for personal glory 
no 
the glory that i yearn to recapture   
    is the glory of gotham 
how can this be accomplished 
i know   
    you re all concerned 
relax 
i ll take care of the squealing  wretched 
pinhead puppets of gotham 
i didn t say that 
you must admit i played
this stinking city   
    like a harp from hell 
you must admit   
    i played this stinking city
like a harp from hell 
why is there always someone who brings
eggs and tomatoes to a speech 
there he is 
my babies 
did you miss me 
did you miss me 
great speech  oswald 
my name is not oswald

i am an animal  cold blooded 
crank the a c  
where are my lists  bring me the names 
it s time 
these are the names of the first born sons
of gotham city 
just like i was 
and like me  a terrible fate waits for them 
tonight  while their parents party   
   they ll be dreaming away   
   in their safe cribs   
   their soft beds   
   and we ll snatch them   
   carry them into the sewer   
   and toss them into a deep  dark 
watery grave 
penguin 
killing sleeping children   
   isn t that a little   
no  it s a lot 
a reminder 
tonight is that loathsome party hosted
by the odious mr  shreck 
may we rsvp
in the resoundingly negative 
not interested 
although   
   selina kyle might be there 
ingenious costume 
let me guess 
trust fund goody goody 
feeling good

of gotham city 
i am the light of this city   
   and i am its mean  twisted soul

aren t you tired of this
sanctimonious robber baron   
   coming out on top when
he should be six feet under 
you may have problems with your boss 
but who do you think you are 
i don t know anymore  bruce 
a kiss under the mistletoe 
 mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it  
 but a kiss can be even deadlier   
    if you mean it  
oh  my god 
does this mean we have to start fighting 
let s go outside 
  are you okay 
  i m all right 
you didn t invite me   
   so i crashed 
what do you want 
right now  my troops   
   are fanning out across town   
   for your children 
yes 
for your first born sons 
the ones you left defenseless at home   
   so you could dress up like jerks   
   get juiced and dance   
   badly 
i ve personally come   
   for gotham s favorite son   
   mr  chip shreck 
you re coming with me 
you great white dope   
   to die  way down in the sewer 
not chip  if you have any human feeling 
take me instead 
i don t  so  no 
i m the one you want 
isn t it max shreck who manipulated
and betrayed you 
isn t it max  not chip   
   you want to see immersed
to his eyeballs in raw sewage 
okay  you got a point 
i ll let the little prince live  for now 
in the duck 
this is going to be good   
   to cut down a whole crop
of gotham s most promising   
   before their prime 
you ask me    how do i lure them in 
a little  pied penguin  action 
and you get to watch them sink   
   into a deep puddle   
   of your industrial by products 
then   
   you join them 
hurry up and get those kids loaded 
right this way  kiddies 
come with me 
so where are all the children 
 dear penguin 
 the children regret
they re unable to attend 
 batman  
my dear penguins   
   we stand on a great threshold 
it s okay to be scared 
many of you won t be coming back 
thanks to batman   
   the time has come   
   to punish all god s children 
first   second   third  and fourth born 
why be biased 
male and female 
hell  the sexes are equal   
   with their erogenous zones   
   blown sky high 
forward   
   march 
the liberation of gotham   
   has begun 
the penguins are moving above ground 
penguin army   
    approaching launch destination
at gotham plaza 
one minute until ignition 
they wouldn t put me on a pedestal   
   so i m laying them on a slab 
penguins seem to be converging
on gotham plaza 
thirty seconds until ignition 
estimated casualties after launch 
100 000 people 
the penguins have reached
gotham square 
fifteen seconds to ignition 
ready when you are  sir 
i ve got the coordinates 
let s turn them around 
something is wrong 
something has jammed the signal 
they seem to be turning around 
there is also something coming this way 
very large  very fast 
who s there 
i m homing in on the signal s origin 
you re jealous
because i m a genuine freak   
   and you have to wear a mask 
you might be right 
but what it all comes down to is 
who s holding the umbrella 
my babies 
i don t know what you want 
but i can get it with a minimum of fuss 
money 
jewels 
a very big ball of string 
your blood  max 
i gave at the office 
a half pint  i m talking gallons 
let s make a deal 
other than my blood  what can i do 
sorry  max  a die for a die 
you re not just saving a life   
shut up  you re going to jail 
don t be naive  the law doesn t
apply to people like him    or us 
wrong on both counts 
why do this 
let s just take him to the police 
then we can go home   
   together 
selina

split   
   down the center

   forever  just like in a fairy tale 
i just couldn t live with myself
