to read such rubbish
usually its a waste of time
whatever todays issue
the penguin man or myth
the globe right here 25 cents
well heres hoping
with luck gotham will have its first
merry christmas in years
i feel almost vulgar at yuletide
mentioning the new power plant
but if were to break ground
when we must ill need permits
variances tax incentives
that sort of pesky nonsense
power plant
studies show weve enough power to get
us into the middle of the next century
your analysts foresee growth
at 1 per annum thats a mild swelling
imagine
a gotham city
of the future lit up like a blanket
of stars
but blinking on and off
embarrassingly low on juice
frankly
i cringe mr mayor
sorry any plans must go
to the usual committees
through the usual channels
i have a suggestion
well
actually really just more like a question
im afraid we havent
properly housebroken ms kyle
in the plus column though
she makes great coffee
dad
mr mayor time to go down
and bring joy to the masses
actually more of a question
you stupid corn dog
corn dog corn dog
i have enough signatures
from shreck employees to warrant a recall
thats not a threat just simple numbers
maybe but you sure as hell
dont have an issue or a candidate
thank you ladies and gentlemen
from those of us at city hall
to each and every one of you
happy holidays
we have with us a man who needs
no introduction hes given us so much
please welcome gothams
own santa claus max shreck
pick up those contracts for personnel and
pick up the dry cleaning
and paper towels
darn
i forgot my speech
remind me to take it out
on whatshername
santa claus
afraid not
im just a poor schmo got lucky
sue me
if i want to give some back
i only wish i could hand out more
than just
expensive baubles
i wish i could hand out world peace
and unconditional love
wrapped in a big bow
oh but you can
oh but you will
merry christmas
great idea
not mine
what are you waiting for the signal
we want the big guy
the guy who runs the show
what do you want
not you
shreck
youll have to go through me
dad go save yourself
dad go
shut up
take one step closer mr manbat and ill
you missed
the batman
or is it just batman
your choice of course
well that was
very brief
just like all the men in my life
what men
well
then again theres you
but you need therapy
thanks for saving the day batman
the circus gang is back
well see
they almost made off with our mover
and shaker max shreck
where is that insufferable son of a bitch
i believe the word youre looking for is
actually this is all just a bad dream
youre at home in bed
heavily sedated resting comfortably
dying from the carcinogens
youve personally spewed
in a lifetime of profiteering
tragic irony
or poetic justice
you tell me
my god its true
penguin man of the sewer
odd as it may seem max
you and i have something in common
were both perceived as monsters
but somehow
youre a wellrespected monster
and i am to date
not
frankly i feel thats a bum rap
im a businessman
tough yes
shrewd okay but that does not
make me a monster
dont embarrass yourself max
i know all about you
what you hide i discover
what you put in your toilet
i place on my mantle get the picture
is that supposed to hypnotize me
no just give you a splitting headache
its not working
oh you big baby
just blanks
would i go through all this trouble
just to kill you
no max
i have an entirely other purpose
im ready max
ive been down here too long
its time for me to ascend
to reemerge
with your help
your knowhow
your savvy
i wasnt born in the sewer you know
i come from
like you
and like you i want some respect
a recognition of my basic humanity
but most of all
i want to find out who i am
by finding my parents
learning my human name
simple stuff that the good people
of gotham take for granted
and
exactly why am i going to help you
well
lets start
lets see what we have in here
a batch of toxic waste
from your clean textile plant
theres a whole lagoon of this crud
in the back
it could have come from anywhere
what about the documents that prove you
own half of the firetraps in gotham city
if there were such documents
thats not an admission
they wouldve been shredded
good idea
a lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference
by the way
hows fred atkins your old partner
fred
freds actually
i believe hes on an extended vacation
hes good
good
hiya max remember me
im freds hand
want to greet any other body parts
remember max
you flush it i flaunt it
you know what mr penguin sir
i think perhaps
i could help orchestrate
a welcome home scenario for you
once were both back home
perhaps we could help each other
you wont regret this mr shreck
honey im home
oh i forgot im not married
miss kitty
back from more sexual escapades
you refuse to share
not that id ever pry
drink your dinner
what
how can anyone be so pathetic
yes to you i seem pathetic
but im a working girl
must pay the rent maybe if you
chipped in instead of stepping out
selina dear its your mother
just calling to say hello
yeah but
but im disappointed youre not
coming home for christmas
i want to discuss why you insist
on languishing in gotham city
as some lowly secretary
lowly assistant
selina about that christmas getaway
we planned
ill be going alone dr shaw says i need
to be my own person not an appendage
some appendage
the party never stops
on selina kyles answering machine
i shouldve let him win
that last racquetball game
hello
selina kyle
were calling to tell you about exciting
new gotham lady perfume
it makes women feel like women
and the men have no complaints either
this is yourself reminding you to come
all the way back to the office
if you forgot the bruce wayne file
you stupid corn dog
working late
im just boning up for your bruce wayne
meeting in the morning
i pulled all the files
on the proposed power plant
and mr waynes hopedfor investment
i even opened the protected files
how industrious
how did you open the protected files
may i ask
i figured your password was geraldo
your chihuahua and it was
this is all very interesting
though a bit on the technical side
about how the power plant
is a power plant in name only
since in fact its going to be a big
giant
big giant capacitor
and instead of generating power
itll be sucking power from
gotham city
and storing it
stockpiling it
which is a very novel approach id say
whod you say this to
nobody
what did curiosity do to the cat
im no cat
im just an assistant
a secretary
and a very good one
too good
listen
its our secret honest
how can you be so mean
to someone so meaningless
this power plant
is my legacy its what i leave behind
for chip
nothing must prevent that
go ahead intimidate me
bully me if it makes you feel big
its not like you can kill me
actually its a lot like that
for a second you really frightened me
really
honey im home
oh i forgot im not married
selina this is your mother call me
selina this is your mother
why havent you called me back
hello selina kyle
were just calling to make sure
youve tried gotham lady perfume
one whiff of this and your boss
will ask you to stay after work
for a candlelight staff meeting for two
gotham lady perfume
exclusively at shrecks department store
i dont know about you
miss kitty but i feel
so much yummier
ladies and gentlemen
i stand before you again to denounce
the urban chaos we live with in our city
its got to stop
its going to stop
our community is coming apart
in a season when
it should be coming together
i dont care what the cynics may say
this is the christmas season
and should be a healing time
i say that not only as an official
but as a husband and a father
last nights violence wont happen again
im not good at speeches
so ill just say thanks
its the hideous penguin man
take the baby just dont hurt me please
this was the remarkable scene
only minutes ago in gotham plaza
the mysterious penguin saving the life
of the mayors baby
and announcing his presence
all i want in return
is a chance
to find my mom and dad
a chance to find out who they are
and thusly
who i am
and then
with my parents
try to understand why
why they did what i guess
they felt they had to do
to a child
who was born
a little different
a child
who spent his first christmas
and many since
in a sewer
mr wayne something wrong
his parents
this scene direct from gotham plaza
i hope he finds them
here he is standing alongside
gothams leading citizen max shreck
how about a statement
people want to know
penguins not to be disturbed
its a public place
walk now move
freedom of the press
wait a minute
what about the freedom
to rediscover your roots
with dignity and privacy
is the penguin a personal friend
hes a personal friend of the whole city
so have a heart
give the constitution a rest
its christmas
red triangle circus put on
a swell show with fierce lions
circus returns for a twoweek
kids will love
thanks
its cold
its vichyssoise
its supposed to be cold
circus is back with a freak show
may not be suitable for kids
featuring a poodle lady
the worlds fattest man
and aquatic bird boy
why are you determined to prove
that this penguin is not what he seems
must you be the only lonely manbeast
in town
the circus folded its tents yesterday
after reports of missing children
in several towns
police have closed down
the red triangle fairgrounds
however at least one
freakshow performer vanished before
he could be questioned
i suppose you feel better now
no
actually i feel worse
whyre you still out
are you concerned about that strange
heroic penguin person
i think he knows who his parents are
theres something else
mr penguin
a penguin is a bird that cannot fly
i am a man
i have a name
oswald cobblepot
youll never be able to settle with them
true
i was their numberone son
and they treated me like number two
but its human nature to fear
the unusual
perhaps
when i held my
tiffany baby rattle
with a shiny flipper
instead of five chubby digits
they freaked
but i forgive them
penguin forgives parents
im at peace with myself and the world
dont need hands as long
as you got heart
my heart is filled with love
i feel five feet tall
hes like a frog that became a prince
no hes more like a penguin
now now pretty little thing
nice and easy
i love a big strong man whos not afraid
to show it with someone half his size
be gentle its my first time
tictactoe
you make it easy dont you
always waiting for some batman
to save you
i am catwoman
hear me roar
id offer you coffee but my assistant
is using her vacation time
good time everyone but the banditsll
be slacking off till after the new year
im not sure i like the inference
i didnt realize i made one
im pushing this power plant now
because itll cost more later
a million saved is a million earned
i commissioned this report
take a look at it
gotham city has a power surplus
im sure you know that
my question is
whats your angle
power surplus bruce shame on you
no such thing one can never have
too much power
if my life has a meaning
thats the meaning
ill fight you ive already spoken
to the mayor and we agree
mayors come and go
blue bloods tire easily
can you go 15 rounds
with muhammad shreck
i guess well find out
of course i dont have a crime boss
like cobblepot in my corner
crime boss shows what you know
mr tothemanorborn
withasilverspoon
oswald is gothams new golden boy
if his parents hadnt 86ed him
youd have been bunkies at prep school
he controls the red triangle gang
i cant prove it yet but we both
ill not stand for mudslinging here
if my assistant was here
shed have already escorted you out
anywhere he wants
preferably some nightspot grotto
or
secluded hideaway
nice suit
thats my name dont wear it out
or ill make you buy me a new one
this is bruce
wayne
weve met
have we
no im sorry i mistook me
for somebody else
you mean mistook me
isnt that what i said
i dont think so
what happened
did you hurt yourself on that ski slope
is that why you cut short your vacation
came back
its a blur
not complete amnesia i remember
sister mary margaret puking in church
and betsy saying
it was morning sickness
and the time i forgot to wear
my underpants to school
and the name of the boy who noticed
was ricky friedburg
hes dead now
but last night
complete blur
couldnt you just die
please
show out mr wayne
with pleasure
your coat mr wayne
you dont seem like the type
who does business with shreck
no you dont seem like the type
to take orders from him
well thats a
long story
i could free up some time
im listed
im tempted
im working
im leaving
you buy that blurry business
women
nothing surprises me
except your late mother
whod have thought selina
had a brain to damage
bottom line
she tries to blackmail me
ill drop her out of a higher window
meantime
lve got badder fish to fry
oswald
its max
youre home
howve you been
your extended family
good to have a family
id rather not be disturbed now
come on downstairs oswald
i have a surprise
i dont like surprises
come on
dont peek
youll spoil it
adulation is a cross to bear
god knows i know
but someones got to supplant our
standing in the way of progress mayor
and dont deny it mr cobblepot
youve got the magic
your charismas bigger than both of us
come on down
mayor
mayor
elections happen in november
its late december
dont worry
i want you to meet jen and josh
my image consultants
here
reclaim your birthright
im jen
okay lets see what id like to do first
is put these gloves on you
our research tells us
that voters like fingers
so if we were to just lose this
well do it another time
not a lot of reflective surfaces
in the sewer huh
still it could be worse
my nose could be gushing blood
what do you mean by that
everybody back to work
lets make
a mayor
youre right we missed
the regular election
but elected officials can be recalled
impeached
given the boot look at nixon agnew
then think of you
oswald cobblepot filling the void
id like to fill her void
well need signatures to overturn
the ballot i can supply those
teach her my french flipper trick
we need one more thing
a platform
stop global warming start global cooling
make the world an icebox
i like it but to get the mayor recalled
we must have a catalyst
youre doing great mayor cobblepot
your table is ready mayor cobblepot
i need you oswald i need you now
thats the biggest parasol ive ever seen
soon an incident like the gulf of tonkin
or the reichstag fire
you want my old friends up there
to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy
exactly
sounds fun
but
i mustnt get sidetracked maxie
i have my own things to tend to
sidetracked this is your chance
to fulfill your destiny
that your parents carelessly discarded
reclaim my birthright you mean
lmagine as mayor
you have the ear of the media
access to the captains of industry
unlimited poontang
you drive a hard bargain maxie
all right ill be mayor
burn baby burn
who is she
what is she
i dont know whether to open fire
or fall in love
you poor guys
always confusing your pistols
with your privates
dont hurt us our takehomes
less than 300
youre overpaid hit the road
go ahead and hit me
admiring your handiwork
touring the riot scene
gravely assessing the devastation
upstandingmayor stuff
youre not the mayor
things change
what do you want
the direct approach
i admire that in a man with a mask
you dont really think youll win do you
things change
i saw her first got to fly
how could you im a woman
im sorry
as i was saying im a woman
and cant be taken for granted
lifes a bitch now so am i
who are you
whos the man behind the bat
maybe you can help me find
the woman
behind the cat
no thats not you
there you are
saved by kitty litter
bastard
alfred
bring me some antiseptic ointment
coming are you in pain sir
not really
i may have saved the mayors baby
but i refuse to save a mayor
who stood by helpless as a baby
while gotham was ravaged
by a disease
that turned eagle scouts
into crazed clowns
and happy homemakers into catwomen
thank you
oswald cobblepot the mystery manbeast
made his bid to run gotham
mr cobblepot you are the coolest
role model a young person could have
and youre the hottest young person
a role model could have
here
wear a button
let me just get it on here
thank you
this mayor stuff is not about power
its about reaching out to people
touching people groping people
penguin
my name is not penguin
its oswald cobblepot
oswald theres somebody here to see you
just the pussy ive been looking for
its chilly in here
ill warm you
down oswald
we need to talk
you see
you and i have something in common
sounds familiar
appetite for destruction
contempt for the czars of fashion
wait dont tell me
naked sexual charisma
batman
the thorn in both our sides
the fly in our ointment
ointment
ive got scented and unscented
ill come back later
perchance are you a registered voter
im a mayoral prospect
i have but one pet cause today
ban the bat
oh him again no bother
hes already history check it out
well disassemble his batmobile
and turn it into an hbomb on wheels
hed have even more power as a martyr
to destroy batman we must first
turn him into what he hates the most
namely us
frame him
not even in office yet
and already an enemies list
those names are not for prying eyes
why should i trust some catbroad anyway
maybe youre a screwedup sorority chick
getting back at her daddy
for not buying her that pony
when she turned sweetsixteen
nice birdie
nice kitty
nice kitty
batman napalmed my arm
he knocked me off a building just
when i started to feel good about myself
i want to play an integral part
in his degradation
a plan is forming
i want in
the thought of busting batman
makes me feel all
dirty
maybe ill just give myself a bath
right here
i challenge the mayor
to relight the christmas tree
in gotham plaza tomorrow night
sir shall we change the channel
to a program with some dignity and class
the love connection perhaps
not that i have any faith in the mayor
but i hope and pray
that batman
will be present to preserve the peace
subtle
why are you doing this
selina
sorry i didnt mean to scare you
scare me i was just scaring myself
i dont see how but
its nice to see you in the real world
away from shreck
its nice to be here
are you all right
you look like you have the holiday blues
or something
boy the news these days
weird
i heard on tv that catwoman
weighs 140 pounds
how do these hacks sleep at night
its not even accurate batman blows it
he probably saved millions
in property damage alone
youre not going to the relighting
of the tree are you
i wouldnt be caught dead there
its going to be a hot time
in the cold town tonight
you got kind of a dark side dont you
no darker than yours
why dont you come over
and we can watch it on tv
the treelighting ceremony
i cant i have to be somewhere tonight
how about coming for dinner at five
lets say six
five
five you and me
the tree lights up
and then i push the button
wait wait
i push the button then the tree lights up
who are you
talent scout
come in
i dont just light trees
im an actress as well
what is that thing
a camera or something
say cheese
cheese
thanks alfred
im sure hes wonderful company
but doesnt the goldplatedbachelor bit
get a little stale
a lot like the lonelysecretary syndrome
i guess
executive assistant
sorry
secretary
any girlfriend
sure
you mean as in serious
no had one didnt work
what went wrong hang on
i think i know
you kept things from her
i told her everything
the truth frightened her
there are two truths
you know
she had trouble reconciling them
because i had trouble
reconciling them
vicki thought
vicki
ice skater or stewardess
no she was a photojournalist
was vicki right about your
difficulty with duality
you see
if i say yes then
youll think of me as a
norman bates a ted bundy type and
you might not let me kiss you
its the socalled normal guys
who always let you down
sickos never scare me
at least theyre committed
i cant do that
neither can i
this is a special bulletin
the ice princess has been kidnapped
can you confirm reports of batmans
suspected involvement in the abduction
the evidence is purely circumstantial
this was found stained with blood
in the missing girls dressing room
i must go
no its your house
hold on just sit for a second and relax
ill be right back
ive got to go to the plaza
he is begging me to show
i hoped youd snub him
i cant theres been a kidnapping
heres what i want you to do
shit
tell selina ms kyle
i had to go out of town
tell her that a big business deal came up
you know what
let her know not in some kind of dumb
bemygirlfriend way
ill relay the message
mr wayne told me to tell you that
bruce yes
would you tell him
lve been going through
a lot of changes and
just that
this is not a rejection
my abruptly leaving
in fact he makes me feel the way
i hope i really am
could you just make up a sonnet or
a dirty limerick
one has just sprung to mind
this way maam
ladies and gentlemen
please may i have your attention
i know that to many of you
gotham seems a bit
beleaguered these days
but i want you to know
your elected officials
and your police department
have the situation well in hand
got to hurry
thank you
it was set up to look like i did it
ill tell the police i was kidnapped
by an ugly birdman with fish breath
did somebody say fish
i havent been fed all day
eat floor
high fiber
hey stud
i thought we had something together
we do
got to go girl talk
she let me go i think cause i reasoned
with her girltogirl
be careful dont move
lawn dart
rats with wings do your thing
batman pushed the princess
hold your fire
youre catnip to a girl like me
handsome dazed
and to die for
mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it
but a kiss
can be even deadlier if you mean it
youre the second man
whos killed me this week
but ive got seven lives left
i tried to save you
seems like every woman
you try to save ends up dead
or deeply resentful
maybe you should retire
damn
outstanding
youre beauty and the beast
in one luscious christmas gift pack
you said youd scare the ice princess
she looked pretty scared to me
a touch of the bubbly
so what are we waiting for
lets consummate our fiendish union
what
oh come on
cant you picture
its dark in the mayors mansion
im bushed so here you come
into the bedroom
twitching your little tail
my slippers in one hand
a dry martini in the other
please
i wouldnt touch you to scratch you
you lousy minx i should have you spayed
you sent out all the signals
i dont think i like you anymore
goodbye my unintended
go to heaven
there he is
dont adjust your sets
welcome
to the oswald cobblepot
school of driving
gentlemen start your screaming
this may be a bad time to mention it
but my license has expired
relax
ill take care of the squealing wretched
pinhead puppets of gotham
you must admit i played this stinking city
like a harp from hell
helpless old lady at 1200 high
thats funny
now im a little worried
so he survived why worry
he didnt even lose a limb
an eyeball bladder control
listen to them theyve lost faith
in old symbols
theyre ready to bond with you
the icon of the future
if it works dont fix it
well celebrate tonight at my annual ball
shreck and cobblepot
the visionary alliance
when it came time
to ensure the safety of our fair city
did the mayor have a plan
no
he relied on a man
a batman
a ticking timebomb of a costumed freak
our prime concern is
this ghastly grotesque
but lets not forget about
repairing the batmobile
theres security to consider
we cant just take it to any old body shop
security
who let vicki vale into the batcave
im working i turn around and there she is
hi vick come on in
ready
ill take the stairs
you ask am i up here for personal glory
no
the glory that i yearn to recapture
is the glory of gotham
how can this be accomplished
i know
youre all concerned
relax
ill take care of the squealing wretched
pinhead puppets of gotham
i didnt say that
you must admit i played
this stinking city
like a harp from hell
you must admit
i played this stinking city
like a harp from hell
why is there always someone who brings
eggs and tomatoes to a speech
there he is

in their safe cribs
their soft beds
and well snatch them
carry them into the sewer
and toss them into a deep dark
watery grave
penguin
killing sleeping children

and betrayed you
isnt it max not chip

to his eyeballs in raw sewage
okay you got a point
ill let the little prince live for now
in the duck
this is going to be good
to cut down a whole crop
of gothams most promising
before their prime
you ask me how do i lure them in
a little pied penguin action
and you get to watch them sink
into a deep puddle
of your industrial byproducts
then
