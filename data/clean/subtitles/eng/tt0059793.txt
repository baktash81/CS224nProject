  night of the surter 
  what was that we saw tonight 
  surter beach party 
  and the night before last 
  son of surt and sinbad the surter 
  double feature 
  canoe   
do you ever get a spooky feeling
that we keep seeing
the same movie over and over 
and all they do
is change the titles a little 
yeah  it s terrific stuff  isn t it 
couldn t we  just once 
see a nice quiet movie 
where boy meets girl 
they have problems
which aren t weird  they fall in love 
and live happily ever after 
why would you want
to see unhealthy stuff like that 
oh  i don t know  maybe once
i d like to go to a movie
where i don t get seasick 
i ll make you a deal 
you go with me thursday night 
next time i ll take you to one of those
happily ever after clambakes  deal 
  i guess 
  where s the thing playing 
oh  who knows  maybe they don t
make movies like that anymore 
well  sure 
you wanna know why 
because people don t want to
be depressed by all that slop 
ha  that henderson boy went
right into the house with her 
 shouting  right into the house 
she and the henderson boy 
the two of them 
why shouldn t he go
in the house 
he s been hanging around
since he was old enough to wave bye bye 
nevertheless 
they happen to represent
two separate and distinct
members of the opposite sex 
  alone  in that house 
  you tell them  kid 
with their parents all over europe 
someone s got to keep an eye
on those girls 
meantime 
by authority of
the federal communications commission 
and the grace of
a kindly providence 
which gave me the power of
not having to listen to people 
i am now going off the air 
don t you dare take that thing off 
i haven t finished talking 
good night  old woman 
i can t hear what you re sayin

  mm hm 
you won t regret it  i m sure 
mother is an extremely fine cook 
  i m sure she is  gregory 
  mother cooks the best duck 
and as for the duck 
did i tell you it was a gadwall 
no  i don t believe you did 
i  uh  stood all day
in a duck blind to get it 
in the pouring rain 
i almost got pneumonia 
  oh  i m so sorry 
  no  it s all right  it was worth it 
well worth it 
it s a beautiful creature 
perfectly beautiful  superb eating 
mother    mother prepares duck
in the classic  old fashioned way 
she hangs it out
on the screen porch
for 48 hours before cooking 
it makes all the difference
in the world 
  all the difference in the world 
   girl  i  um   
i m looking forward
to meeting your mother 
i ve heard so much about her 
i know you two are gonna be
the very best of friends 
and now  uh   
  good night 
  good night 
  i ll see you in the morning 
  mm hm 
  same time as usual 
  hmm 
 barking 
 growling 
 growling 
 tearing 
   barking 
  quiet  blitzy 
good night 
my little beauties   cooing 
 growling 
 meowing 
oh 
 knocking 
okay  where s the duck 
  i beg your pardon 
  i want my duck 
your duck 
if you please 
i m sorry 
i really don t know   
 growling  where is that sneaky 
miserable guttersnipe 
  he s got my duck 
  what duck 
don t you dare pretend with me 
  i saw him come in here with it 
  you saw who come in 
patricia randall 
i have had all i can take 
that rotten cat of yours 
he molests my prize albino fantails 
crawls all over my car every time
i wash it with his muddy paws 
he digs up mother s bulbs 
he s driven my dog to the brink
of a nervous breakdown 
you mean dc 
well  i m sorry 
but actually  he isn t my cat 
he isn t anybody s cat 
what are you talking about 
he lives here  doesn t he 
of course  but don t you see 
you don t own someone like dc 
he s family 
 sighing  oh 
but what am i gonna do 
shoot  i spent all day
in a duck blind 
humph  pouring rain 
and i get one duck 
one single gadwall 
and that flea raddled fiend
had to go and steal it 
i know you re upset 
but be honest  it was dark  wasn t it 
it could have been that nasty cat
from across the street 
the one who does everything
that dc gets blamed for 
   meowing 
  now  do you think   
oh  dc  how could you 
hold this 
dc  give that to me this instant 
 meowing 
i want you to know
i m very  very disappointed in you 
oh 
oh  gregory  i am sorry 
i can t think what
could have come over him 
bad  bad cat  ah 
 bad  bad cat  
you re a menace
to the whole neighborhood 
mark you  if i had my way 
the authorities would
do away with you 
now  wait a minute  gregory 
dc s a cat 
he can t help his instincts 
he s a hunter  just like you are 
only he s not stupid enough
to sit out in the pouring rain all day 
well 
just let me make myself quite clear 
you better keep him locked up at night 
the next time i find him at our place 
i ll give him a pantsful of buckshot 
nine times  if necessary 
 meowing 
i know 
i don t care for him much  either 
but he does have a point 
don t you think 
was that gregory
i heard down there 
  correct 
  he sounded angry 
yeah  i believe he was 
  what goes on around here  anyway 
  nothing  nothing at all 
dc just happened to take a duck
off gregory s back porch 
   happened  to take a duck 
  yes 
gregory came stamping and banging
over here to find it 
furious  made a perfect fool of himself 
i don t think he s a stable person 
  there goes my duck dinner 
  your what 
he invited me to his house for dinner 
his mother was gonna fix the duck 
fix the   
ingrid  don t you see 
you re walking into a trap 
for goodness sakes  gregory drives me
to work in the morning 
at night he picks me up
and he takes me home 
if he wants to go
to all that trouble 
the least i can do
is be courteous if he asks me to dinner 
how can you be so blind 
it began with
the old car pool routine  right 
why shouldn t it  his law office
happens to be next door to where i work 
but the point is  there used to be
five people in that car 
then gregory traded in his sedan
for a two seater sports car 
and mr  burke 
miss patters and miss mosely
were ruthlessly squeezed out
to find other transportation  correct 
  now  listen   
  creeping matrimony  that s what it is 
the car pool  the duck dinner 
a movie here and there 
inky  you re taking the gas
and you don t even know it 
thank you  dear 
i m sure you mean well 
but i think i can handle
the gregory situation
in my own bumbling way 
i m sorry  but i suppose at your age 
when that important person
hasn t come into your life 
  well   
  well  what 
well  i suppose a tinge 
just the faintest tinge  of desperation 
begins to blow your judgment 
good night 
i can assure you  there is no tinge
of desperation in my outlook 
  and my vision is exceptionally clear 
  good 
which  i might add 
brings us to your friends 
  my friends 
  yes  dear 
the one we ve been tripping over
all these years 
canoe  that s very unfair 
canoe is   
well  he s just defenseless 
he s very sweet and young  and   
   needs help 
  i certainly agree he needs something 
doesn t he do anything
but mope around in shorts
  and eat us out of house and home 
  just shows how little you know him 
  canoe has plenty of ambition 
  what 
to be the first 50 year old surfer
at santa monica 
if you ask me  he s   
what s the matter 
dc s wearing a wristwatch 
well  what will that dear  sweet 
innocent cat be bringing home next 
the hope diamond  i imagine 
  where do you suppose he got it 
  i don t know 
probably some child slipped it on 
or some teenager put it on for a joke 
good night  check with lost and found
in the morning 
 patti  ingrid 
look  someone started to scratch
something on the casing 
see   h e  
and that looks like part of an l 
h e l   
i ll bet somebody was trying to write
 help  and they were interrupted 
somebody s in trouble 
what cooks in that wild
little head of yours now 
somebody s in trouble 
i feel it in my bones 
you bet  now get out and let me
go to sleep  i m a working girl 
don t you think
we ought to do something 
good night 
come on  dc  give 
someone does need help  don t they 
i know you could find a way to tell me
if you really wanted to 
a smart cat like you 
you can be such a rat sometimes 
don t say anything 
just point me towards the coffee 
what s wrong with you 
i didn t close my eyes once last night 
oh  i ve got huge dark circles
under my eyes 
  and me so young 
  what s bothering you 
i just couldn t stop thinking
about this watch 
especially that pitiful
cry for help on the back 
oh  you re not going to start that 
so help me   
you know  i thought
and thought and thought 
and i think i finally know the answer 
the watch belongs to her 
  the kidnapped woman 
  yeah 
come off it  how far out can you get 
does it have a name 
   honking 
  no  but it s exactly the sort of watch
a woman like that would wear 
feminine  yet   
bank tellerish  if you see what i mean 
patti  you are absolutely impossible 
have a nice day at the office  inky 
you ve got that terrible
butter won t melt in your mouth
expression 
i know what s going on
in your little mind 
  and i forbid it 
  what do you mean 
you re not going to overdramatize this 
like you do everything else 
i absolutely forbid you to get
the police stirred up
with another of your hallucinations
about people in trouble 
you re not to go near
the police with that watch 
  certainly 
  bye 
   gregory  good morning  ingrid 
  good morning 
naturally  i wouldn t go to the police 
this is a job for the fbi 
may i help you 
  yes  i d like to see a  uh   
  we call them agents here 
  yes  i d like to see an agent 
  may i ask what about 
i have information
about one of your crimes 
  thank you  would you wait over there 
  yes 
  these are for you  mr  hart 
  thank you 
  i m back at 11 00 
  yes  sir 
  morning  hart 
  good morning  mr  kelso 
  hi  vicky  anything for me 
  no  sir 
 kelso  if mr  paul calls about
the bank records  put him through 
see you around 
  is he an agent 
  yes  he is 
  nice face  hasn t he 
  why  yes 
 buzzing 
yes  mr  ellender 
the messenger hasn t arrived yet 
i can put a tracer on it 
we haven t heard
from denver all morning 
i ll connect you with agent morrow 
he s got the reports on that case 
 phone ringing 
 clearing throat 
well  we ve got 22 howards
in los angeles county 
better start right at the top 
mr  kelso  i have something to report
on one of your cases 
it s a family cat 
he s called dc 
that means  darn cat  
daddy named him 
he called him something worse 
mother won t let us use that 
excuse me 
first  what is your name 
patricia randall 
808 pendelton avenue 
uh huh  and what is
this information you have  miss randall 
it s dc  our cat 
he likes to prowl around at night 
as cats do  nothing wrong with that 
and he likes people  as a general rule 
if they re nice and give him food 
he goes back 
i think he has a regular route
to pick out food 
sort of like a milkman in reverse 
  and this relates to one of our cases 
  yes  yes  it does 
last night
dc was out roaming around 
and stole a duck from mr  benson
down the street 
ah  miss  um  randall   
i m afraid that
that s a police matter 
you see  our jurisdiction is limited
to certain fields of investigation 
at the present time 
duck stealing is not one of them 
how about bank robbery
and kidnapping 
maybe i d better hear
the rest of your story 
thank you 
well  last night dc came home
wearing a wristwatch 
  wearing a wristwatch 
  yes 
  instead of his collar 
  oh 
and i couldn t help thinking what
i would do if i were poor miss miller 
held prisoner by two hoodlums 
  and a stray cat came wandering in 
  mm hm 
don t you see  i d try to put
something of mine on the cat as a clue 
like a wristwatch  maybe even
try to scratch something on it 
do you have this wristwatch 
mr  kelso  i knew you d understand 
that s why i selected you personally 
here 
you see  of course  on the back 
where she started to scratch
the word  help  
  and was interrupted 
  uh huh 
 h e    
and that squiggle could be an  l  
well  that doesn t quite
spell  help   does it 
she was wearing a wristwatch
at the time of her abduction 
we have only a superficial description 
  this may or may not be the watch 
  but wouldn t it be enough to start on 
i wonder if you could wait here
for just a few moments 
of course  my entire day
is at your disposal 
thank you  miss randall 
  it s a goofy idea 
  that s what i thought too  sir 
  the only thing is  i like it 
  you do  sir 
i don t like this paper chase
someone s leading us on 
those 20 dollar bills from the bank
we ve been picking up
  at convenient towns up the valley 
  they went in another direction 
or stayed here in the city 
this watch lead ties in with that 
  how s your workload  kelso 
  me  sir 
uh  well  i m going over
old bank records on johnny the cooch 
  we re ready to trip him up 
  the cooch can wait 
kidnapping takes priority 
i want you to set up surveillance
and tail this cat 
  tail the cat 
  he may take us to the criminals 
that s all 
actually  i don t have
any experience in tailing cats 
for that matter  who does 
sorry  sir  you wish me to set up
a surveillance on this informant 
exactly as if we thought of him
as a person 
unless  of course  it works out better
to think of him as a cat 
sir  i think it s only fair to tell you 
i don t get on well with cats 
there s a kind of an antagonism
between us 
  is that so 
  yes  and i have a slight allergy 
allergy  i know the medical records
of every man in this office 
have you been keeping
something from me 
it s a very small allergy  sir 
  hardly worth mentioning 
  don t 
stay in touch  i m available
on this case 24 hours a day 
yes  sir 
sir  it s just that every time
i m around c   
c     loud sneeze 
gesundheit  and good luck 
thank you  sir 
 sneezing 
yes  a lot of people
are gonna be sorry
for the things they said about dc 
 laughing  wait till they find out
he s working with the fbi 
i don t think we should expose
your cat s relationship with us
at this time 
i d like to remain
as inconspicuous as possible 
you don t want everyone in the
neighborhood to know who you are 
exactly  people tend
to become overstimulated
when they discover an fbi man
in the neighborhood 
it interferes with the quiet 
orderly process of investigation 
  hmm 
  especially kidnap cases 
see  this places the life
of the kidnap victim
into additional jeopardy 
we ve gotta not
generate too much heat 
the kidnappers ll chicken out 
kill miss miller 
dispose of the remains
and take off 
uh  that s one way to put it  yes 
oh 
you go first 
remember  everything
quiet  calm  inconspicuous 
quiet  calm  inconspicuous 
 whistling 
that brazen creature 
right in broad daylight 
what are you cackling about now 
a strange man just went
into the house with patti 
  so what 
  he was carrying a bag 
don t get yourself up
in a sweat  old woman 
  it s probably the plumber 
  it was not the plumber 
  this man was nicely dressed 
  that s the way plumbers dress now 
the prices they charge these days 
i m surprised he wasn t
wearing a tuxedo 
 kelso  do you have any friends 
people who are in and out all the time 
i m afraid so 
father always complained
we were running a rehabilitation center
for punch drunk juveniles 
uh huh  i d prefer a room
on the second floor  actually 
to reduce the chance of somebody
coming in and finding me at work 
  this your room 
  ingrid s  my sister 
  oh  would she mind 
  no  not at all 
  she d be only too happy to help 
  good 
that s the side door
from the kitchen 
yes  that s the exit dc uses when
he goes out for an evening on the town 
uh huh  tonight  we ll set up
our communications unit in here 
whatever you like 
all right  and now  i suppose
i d better meet the c    c   
   sneezes 
  bless you  what did you say 
 rapid breathing 
i said i   
   suppose i   
   better meet the   
  oh 
ah  dc  he s probably goofing around
under the bed or something 
that s his favorite spot 
  ah  your sins have caught up with you 
   meowing 
this is your fbi 
well   chuckle  this is the   
   informant  as we say
down at the office 
hear that  dc 
you re the informant now 
nice little kitty cat 
good  good kitty cat

cahill  spires

 wheezing  sneezing 
what s the matt    oh 
 meowing 
oh  you poor darling 
frightened to death 
that     sneezing  cat 
 honking 
  oh  good morning  mr  benson 
  good morning  mrs  macdougall 
i hope ingrid
is feeling better this morning 
  better  is something wrong 
  well  i figured she was sick 
she had the doctor over last night 
or leastwise 
i assume he was the doctor 
who else would be up there 
in her room 
exactly 
mrs  macdougall 
exactly what time was this 
look at the old buzzard 
i can imagine what she s telling him 
 of course it s none of my business 
but there were men in ingrid s room  
you won t tell him they re fbi people 
no one must know 
what am i supposed to say  the kiwanis
club is having fall maneuvers here 
you re a love  i know you won t
give everything away 
remember  miss miller s life
hangs in the balance 
so does my car pool 
my reputation won t be worth
a plug nickel unless you get them out 
we ve got to think
of miss miller and cooperate 
of course  but the fbi has
gotten along all these years
without using my room
as a base of operation 
i want mr  whoever he ls 
and his ham radio or whatever that is 
out of my room by the time i get home 
or i ll become very difficult 
  is that clear 
  yes  quite 
  have a nice day 
  good morning  ingrid 
  how do you feel this morning 
  be careful  gregory 
be extremely careful what you say 
i haven t had my coffee 
and i m in no mood
for stupid  irresponsible remarks 
oh 
   knocking 
  come in 
  kelso 
  yes  sir 
i was just looking at your report 
it probably sounds peculiar on paper 
if i might amplify   
only thing missing is chester conklin
and the max sennett bathing girls 
that s very good 
  however  we did learn something 
  oh 
there are too many men on the detail 
the informant  that is 
the cat  became suspicious 
i felt that we were crowding him
a little too much 
that s about
the same conclusion i reached 
  i ve assigned the men to other work 
  i won t need them 
as a matter of fact  i m about to
forget this whole cat angle 
you can go back to work
on johnny the cooch 
as you know  i never wanted to
be involved in this cat thing 
however  i would like to try
one more time by myself 
how  single handed and at night 
are you gonna follow this animal 
  i ll use a small transmitter 
  a trans   
  you wanna bug the cat 
  that s right 
okay  one more night 
one  no more 
  thank you  sir 
  and don t try to be a hero 
  if you turn up anything  bring us in 
  absolutely  sir 
  i sure appreciate your help 
  it s all right 
our parents are away 
so i can use their room 
don t worry about your reputation 
when it s over  we can explain
  what the men were doing in your room 
  thanks 
then we ll restore your image
as a nice  quiet  respectful girl 
  who wouldn t get involved with men 
  oh  please  dear 
i don t mind being respectable 
but i don t want to be a cold potato 
i don t think there s danger of that 
do you  mr  kelso 
  no  i hardly think so 
  thanks 
the collar s ready 
  shall i slip it on the informant 
  oh  yes  please 
you d never guess  would you 
that s the bug 
  bug 
  microphone 
and look  here s
a miniature transmitting set 
sweet  isn t it 
wherever dc goes  mr  kelso can hear
everything around him 
conversation  music 
footsteps  anything 
but suppose dc simply
shakes him off his trail 
he did last night  didn t he 
lmpossible  that s where
the direction finder goes to work 
  hey  be careful with that thing 
  absolutely 
dc has a built in beeper in his collar 
which sends out signals 
and the signals are picked up on this 
just by turning it  mr  kelso can tell
by that needle exactly where dc is 
  oh  come on  patti 
  i ll prove it to you 
look  i ll borrow the spare collar
and hide you somewhere in the house 
  and we ll get mr  kelso to find you 
  don t be ridiculous 
i ve got things to do 
and i m sure   
don t you want to see
how they spend your tax money 
you don t want him
to think you re stuffy 
i couldn t care less
whether he thinks i m stuffy or not 
go in there  it ll be fun 
here s the collar 
  hey  this lock sticks 
  no  it works like a charm 
see 
  okay  ingrid s all ready 
  good 
  ready for what 
   knocking 
oh  canoe 
  i promised i d go to the drive in 
  it s almost 9 00 
  can you get rid of him 
  yes  i ll do the camille bit again 
  is he liable to keep hanging around 
  possible 
  he s sweet  but flypaper 
  hey  keep your date with him 
get him out of the neighborhood 
this is my last chance 
i can t risk gumming it up 
i wanted to help 
this will help me 
now  please   
and  uh  hurry 
  all right 
   knocking 
 grunts 
  i m ready  let s go 
  what s your hurry

  hold it down  i gotta call in 
i had a feeling
he d blow this case open 
  the robbers are in this neighborhood 
  i don t want to jump to conclusions 
but we stirred up a hornet s nest 
kelso requesting control  emergency 
   sneezing 
   knocking 
oh  dc  there you are 
did they hurt you 
however did you find them 
i was trailing dc through a yard
down the street 
and he roused up some pigeons 
and person unknown
ripped off a shotgun blast at us 
  main control  go ahead 
  agent kelso here  sir 
  i have something worth looking into 
  that wasn t robbers 
that was your nasty gregory 
shooting at dc 
  who s gregory 
  he lives down the street 
  he keeps pigeons 
  go ahead  kelso 
  oh  boy 
  kelso 
the situation i was just talking about 
it just checked out 
negative 
 loud pounding 
step aside  please 
where is he 
where do you think you re going 
to shoot dc 
i didn t shoot your rotten little beast 
but i should have 
  is anything wrong 
  there most certainly is 
you re not going upstairs
to murder dc in cold blood 
i am not after your moronic cat 
i m after the man
that was following him 
yes  a prowler behaving
in a very peculiar manner 
  why don t we all go talk about it 
  ingrid 
i am going to go through
every inch of this house
  and make sure he didn t sneak in here 
  i ve got to break communications 
  i hardly think that s necessary 
  nevertheless 
i am going up 
 gregory  after all  there s just
you two girls here 
and i would never forgive myself
if i woke up
and found one of you had been murdered 
you ve got nerve 
bursting into my room 
 gregory  now  ingrid 
i want you to believe
that my paramount thought
is for your safety 
 patti  we re perfectly safe 
there s no prowler here 
 gregory  i am not a man
for half measures 
i shall not be content until i have
searched every inch of this house 
gregory benson  i will not have you
tramping around my room this way 
and put down that ridiculous thing
before you shoot somebody 
let me assure you  i am familiar
with the handling of this firearm 
 lngrid  i m warning you 
if you don t get out this instant 
this very instant   
 gregory  i have no intention
of leaving   
 meowing 
excuse me  the wiring
seems okay  miss randall 
  wiring 
  yes  but don t hesitate to call 
  no  thank you 
  just a minute  now you just wait 
i hope you don t think i am goof enough
to believe that ridiculous story
about you being in that closet
to fix that wiring 
  if i may   
  because   
   if you think i think that 
you have another think coming 
miss randall  i m afraid we ll have to
take him into our confidence 
you will take me into nothing 
  i want nothing to do with you 
  i m certain when you hear   
i have borne witness to all the
circumstances i care for one evening 
how come he knows your name 
is he one of the men
mrs  macdougall was talking about 
i couldn t say 
who do you think he is 
i shudder to think 
i really do 
i can say  it does open up
a fascinating area for conjecture 
oh  don t be such
a complete floop  gregory 
this is all perfectly easy to explain 
don t say another word 
or i ll slap your face 
  we re explaining nothing to him 
  well 
i hope you realize that mother is
going to take this all very badly 
  doesn t she usually 
  ingrid 
there s no reason for you
to cast a slur upon my mother 
at least she  after all 
is an innocent party 
yeah  good night 
oh  and just one more thing 
i suggest you find yourself
another car pool 
well  goodbye  gregory 
oh  inky  i m sorry 
it was all my fault 
it s all for the best  i suppose 
um  well  goodbye and thanks very much
for your cooperation 
  goodbye 
  i ve been assigned to a new lead 
i ve got orders
to wrap up the operation here 
why 
well  my boss thinks we re not getting
anywhere with our cat surveillance 
i haven t come up
with a shred of evidence
to connect the cat with the criminals 
but what about miss miller s watch 
the office just completed their report
on all the jewelers
and watch repair people in this area 
nothing turned up to indicate
it belonged to miller 
but it does 
you know it does 
i don t know  it s a theory and
without evidence  we can t waste time 
oh  i think that s horrible 
what about miss miller  hmm 
you re gonna abandon her
to the mercy of those criminals 
that s enough  patti tends
to overdramatize things 
what s worse  she has this diabolical
knack of getting everybody involved 
no  it was a good idea  in a way 
we had to be sure 
so long  patti 
goodbye 
oh  i m sorry 
  excuse me 
  sorry  goodbye  now 
i don t know what you must think of me 
every time we met  i lost my temper 
that s all right 
we meet all kinds 
that wasn t what i meant to say 
  i  um   
  it s okay 
  so long  now 
  bye 
that fellow has a most attractive way
of putting his foot in his mouth 
  what d you say his name was 
  zeke kelso 
hmm  well  no matter 
let s go to bed 
tomorrow  if you don t mind 
let s get the house back to normal 
whatever you say 
more evidence 
that s what they want  is it 
hey  get out of it 
  no  no  no  no  no 
  why 
i wouldn t hear of it 
absolutely not 
and besides 
it s none of my business 
  that s all 
  of course it s your business 
that s ridiculous 
we can and we must save miss miller 
  no  i m no hero 
  oh 
look at me

  no 
  that s the thing  i m not a hero 
i wanna tell you  not only will i not

please leave me alone 
  i m very busy
