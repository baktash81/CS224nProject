anderton  show a cop on horseback 
jad  near the capitol 
  no maglev system 
jad  the mall 
georgetown 
the pre cogs can see a murder
four days out  why the late call 
a red ball  crimes of passion have no
premeditation  so they show up late 
most of our scrambles are flash events 
we rarely see premeditation anymore 
  people have gotten the message

i thought they stopped the murder 
that s just an echo 
pre cog déjà vu  if you will 
the really bad ones
the pre cogs see over and over again 
wally  erase the incoming 
narrator 
imagine a world without murder 
  i lost my best friend 
  i lost my aunt 
  i lost my dad 
  i lost my father 
i lost my wife 
narrator  six years ago  the homicide
rate had reached epidemic proportions 
it seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed 
but instead of one miracle  we
were given three  the pre cognitives 
within just one month
under the precrime program   
   the murder rate in the district
of columbia was reduced 90  
  they were waiting for me 
  he was gonna rape me 
  i was going to be stabbed 
  right here 
narrator  precrime effectively
stopped murder in our nation s capital 
in the six years of our experiment   
   there hasn t been a single murder 
narrator 
and now precrime can work for you 
we want to make certain
that every american   
   can bank on the infallibility
of the system 
and to ensure that what keeps us safe
will also keep us free 
  precrime  it works 
man 1  it works 
woman 1  it works 
man 2  it works 
woman 2  it works 
  it works 
children 
precrime  it works 
narrator  on april 22  vote  yes 
on the national precrime initiative 
man 
what s the matter  can t sleep 
anderton  just need a little clarity 
man  true that 
you want the customary clarity or
the new and improved kind of clarity 
anderton 
give me the new stuff 
man  new and improved clarity 
clarity  clarity  yes  indeed 
anderton 
come on  come on 
don t bust my balls  you ve only given
me four  and some of these are duds 
man 
sweet dreams  chief 
don t worry 
your secret s safe with me 
i could use a little juice on my side 
what do you think you know 
it s like my daddy used to say 
 in the land of the blind   
   the one eyed man is king  
anderton

anderton in hologram  sean 
  hi  daddy

anderton 
no  that s good

  see  you re a natural runner 
  gotta keep running 
yeah  gotta keep running 
gotta keep running

anderton  you re gonna beat everybody 
  i think you ll beat everyone someday 
  i gotta go  bye

reminds me of rosarito beach 
remember 
we had 20 dollars and   
waiting in that van so the sun

john  john  john 
put the camera down 
look  i m all ready for bed 
what is this  no  put it away 
it s time to put the camera
to sleep   
   and time to come
and take care of your wife 
why don t you put the camera down
and come and watch the rain with me 
no  i promise i ll make it
a memorable moment 
put the camera down
or you re not getting anything tonight 
 siren wails 
a gentleman at justice
wants to take this away from us 
in a week  people will vote
on whether or not   
   what we ve been doing has been
a noble minded enterprise   
   or a chance to change the way
this country fights crime 
anderton  i understand  sir 
burgess  john   
   watch this danny witwer 
the observer from justice 
  i met him yesterday 
  let him look around 
  answer his questions  but watch him 
  yes  sir 
if there s any problem 
make sure we know about it 
anderton 
i understand 
fletcher  pre cogs declare a killer 
and their name is embedded in wood 
since the shape and grain of each piece
is unique  they re impossible to forge 
you understand the legalistic
drawback to precrime methodology 
  here we go again 
  i m not with the aclu on this   
   but we arrest individuals
who ve broken no law 
  they will 
  the commission is metaphysics 
the pre cogs see the future 
and they re never wrong 
but it s not the future if you stop it 
  isn t that a fundamental paradox 
  yes 
you re talking about predetermination 
which happens all the time 
  why d you catch that 
  it was gonna fall 
anderton  you re certain 
  yeah 
but it didn t fall  you caught it 
preventing it doesn t change
the fact that it was going to happen 
witwer 
you ever get any false positives 
someone intends to kill  but doesn t 
how do the pre cogs tell the difference 
they don t see what you intend to do 
only what you will do 
why can t they see
rapes  assaults  suicides 
because of the nature of murder 
nothing s more destructive to the
metaphysical fabric that binds us   
   than the untimely murder of a human 
  that wasn t walt whitman 
iris hineman  she developed pre cogs 
designed the system and the interface 
witwer  speaking of interfacing 
i d love to say hello 
  to hineman 
  to them 
anderton  cops aren t allowed inside 
  you ve never been inside 
we keep strict separation so that
no one can be accused of tampering 
  i ll be the first one to go in then 
  maybe you didn t hear me 
  if it s a question of authority  
  there is no question 
you don t have any 
i have a warrant in my pocket
that says different 
  show it to me 
  sure 
witwer  this investigation of precrime
and its personnel is conducted   
   under the direct supervision and
permission from the attorney general 
i m here as his representative   
   which means you re now operating
under my supervision 
seems you ve been left
out of the loop 
fletcher 
all right  we re ready  let s go 
  hold it right there  hold on 
computer  not cleared for access 
eye dent  john anderton  approved 
anderton  wally 
wally  no  no  no  no 
danny witwer from justice 
we re to give him the run of the farm 
  i can t touch you 
  don t touch anything 
wally  you can t be in here 
  just answer his questions 
witwer  tell me how  
  they re sleeping 
sorry  tell me how all this works 
the photon milk acts as both a
nutrient supply and conductor 
it enhances the images they receive 
we call the female agatha 
the twins are arthur and dashiell 
we scan by way of optical tomography 
white light pinpoints pulse
along the length of the headgear   
   and are reread after absorption
through their brain tissue 
in other words  we see what they see 
they don t feel pain  we keep
their heads stocked with dopamine 
plus  we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels 
don t want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep 
  they can t be kept too awake either 
anderton  don t think of them as human 
no  they re much more than that 
science has stolen
most of our miracles 
in a way  they give us hope 
hope of the existence of the divine 
it s interesting that some people
have begun to deify the pre cogs 
pre cogs are pattern recognition filters 
that s all 
  yet you call this room the  temple  
  a nickname 
the oracle isn t where
the power is  anyway 
the power is with the priests 
even if they had to invent the oracle 
you guys are nodding like you know
what he s talking about 
well  come on  chief  the way we work 
changing destiny and all   
   we re more like clergy than cops 
  jad 
  yeah 
go to work  all of you 
sorry  old habit 
i spent three years at fuller seminary
before i became a cop 
  my father was proud 
  what does he think of your work 
i don t know  he was shot and killed
when i was 15 at our church in dublin 
i know what it s like
to lose someone close 
nothing s like the loss of a child 
i don t have any children  so i can
only imagine what that was like 
to lose your son
in such a public place like that   
now we can make sure that
kind of thing doesn t happen to anyone 
  tell me what it is you re looking for 
  flaws 
there hasn t been a murder
in six years  this system is  
perfect  i agree 
if there s a flaw  it s human 
it always is 
john 
wally 
can you see 
what happened  her acth levels
just shot through the roof 
  what d you do 
anderton  she grabbed me 
impossible  they re not aware of us 
in the milk  all they see is the future 
  she looked straight at me 
  it could have been a nightmare 
  she spoke to me 
  to you 
what d she say 
 can you see  
 organ music plays 
you the sentry 
yes  sir  i m gideon 
you re chief anderton 
the music relaxes the prisoners 
i don t ever see you precops down here 
am i in trouble 
not yet 
i m interested in a murder 
  i got plenty of those  kill type 
  drowning 
that narrows it down 
not too many in here for that 
  victim s caucasian  female 
  this about the justice department 
i m supposed to spruce up for a tour
they got tomorrow  you like this tie 
stop 
roll back 
there 
she s a golden oldie  one of our first 
probably before your time 
  this is the composite of the three 
  that s right 
combined data stream
based on all three previsions 
  just show me agatha s data stream 
  for that   
   we go for a ride 
anderton 
my god 
i d forgotten there were so many 
gideon  they d all be out there
killing people if it wasn t for you 
look at them 
look at how peaceful they seem 
but on the inside  busy  busy  busy 
okey pokey 
now that is one bad man 
he drowned a woman named
anne lively out at roland lake 
the killer s a john doe 
never identified 
why is he still a john doe 
why wasn t he id d from the eye scan 
those are not his eyes  he had them
swapped out to fool the scanners 
you can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days 
okay  so you want
just the female prevision 
anderton 
that s right 
we don t seem to have her data 
try again 
this is odd  see 
we have the two previsions  we got
what art saw  we got what dash saw 
but agatha s isn t here 
probably just a glitch 
tell me about the intended victim 
this anne lively 
looks like she s a neuroin addict 
like our john doe here 
address history
includes the beaton clinic 
so she cleaned up 
where is she now 
i guess glitches come in twos 
you finally crawl your way out
of one hole just to fall into another 
uh    what     no 
can t let you take that out of here 
chief 
  it s against the rules 
  anything else against the rules 
careful  chief  you dig up the past 
all you get is dirty 
burgess  the third prevision was what 
kind of fuzzy or something 
no  the third prevision 
agatha s prevision  wasn t there 
that s not all  there are a dozen more
cases with missing previsions 
you d think we d have found
the cure for the common cold 
celeste  it s stress 
  what s this 
herbal tea with honey 
i hate herbal tea 
almost as much as i hate honey 
just drink it 
before i pour it in your lap 
  can i get you anything  john 
anderton  no  thank you 
witwer s scheduled for a tour
of containment tomorrow 
yeah  give him a tour 
  lara called me 
  what 
she s worried about you 
quite frankly  so am i 
i m fine 
i understand you ve been spending
a lot of time in the sprawl 
  i go running down there 
  in the middle of the night 
what if danny witwer
insisted on a full chem run 
i m fine 
the minute precrime goes national 
they are going to take it away 
  we won t let them 
  no 
how is an old man and a cop on the
whiff ever going to stop them 
my father once said to me   
    you don t choose the things
you believe in  they choose you  
there s a reason you are here 
had precrime been in place earlier 
your loss would have been prevented 
remember  the eyes  
the eyes of the nation
are on us right now 
i m not the generation
anyone listens to   
   but people trust you when you
speak of your belief in precrime 
they know that it s a belief born of
pain  not politics  i understood that 
i may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause 
but now 
your pain is hurting both of us 
they re not going to take it
away from us 
i won t let them 
witwer

get out of my house  go 
by mandate of the district of columbia 
i m placing you under arrest for  
anderton 
go to sleep 
witwer 
you two stay with me 
 classical music plays 
 anderton gasps 
anderton 
dr  hineman 
hineman  you re trespassing 
i don t have visitors 
 coughs 
that would be from the doll s eye 
the vine   
   the baneberry that scratched you
during your illegal climb over my wall 
it s not a true doll s eye 
it s a little hybrid i designed 
once the poison gets into your
bloodstream  you ll start to see   
   the most extraordinary display
of blue objects 
this just isn t your week  is it 
chief anderton 
i m not a killer 
hineman 
you better drink this 
soon you won t be able to swallow 
and then you ll be totally buggered 
all of it 
okay  now take a minute
to right yourself 
just what is it you think
i can do for you 
you could tell me how someone
can fake a prevision 
how would i know that 
because you invented precrime 
 hineman chuckles 
what s so funny 
if the consequences of several genetic
mistakes and science gone haywire   
   can be called an invention 
then i invented precrime 
  you don t seem proud 
  i m not 
i was trying to heal them 
not turn them into something else 
  heal who 
  the innocents we use to stop the guilty 
you re talking about the pre cogs 
you think they came from a test tube 
they are merely the ones who survived 
i was doing genetic research 
treating children of drug addicts 
this was 10 years ago 
when neuroin first hit the streets 
it was impure  not the engineered
cocktail popular among the educated 
all of these kids were born with severe
brain damage  most died before age 12 
those few who survived 
they had a gift 
i call it a gift  for them 
it was more like a cosmic joke 
they would wake up in the night 
curled in the corner   
   screaming  clawing at the walls 
because when these children
closed their eyes at night   
   they dreamt only of murder
over and over  one after the other 
it didn t take long for us to realize
that the real nightmare was   
   that these dreams were about to come
true  these murders were happening 
you say some of the children died 
so many of them 
despite what we did for them 
or maybe because of what we
did to them  but it doesn t matter 
it s a perfect system now  isn t it 
anderton 
i m not going to commit murder 
i ve never met the man
i m supposed to kill 
and yet a chain of events has started
that will lead you to his murder 
  not if i stay away from him 
  can you avoid a man you ve never met 
  you won t help 
  i can t help you  nobody can 
the pre cogs are never wrong 
but occasionally   
   they do disagree 
what 
most of the time  all three pre cogs
will see an event in the same way   
   but once in a while  one of them will
see things differently than the others 
jesus christ 
why didn t i know about this 
because these minority reports
are destroyed the instant they occur 
why 
for precrime to function  there can t
be any suggestion of fallibility 
who wants a justice system
that instills doubt 
it may be reasonable 
but it s still doubt 
are you saying
i ve haloed innocent people 
i m saying that every so often 
those accused of a precrime   
   just might have
an alternate future 
does burgess know about this 
about this minority report 
i used to joke with lamar that
we were the parents of precrime 
parents often see their children as they
want them to be and not as they are 
answer my question  does lamar
burgess know about the minority report 
yes  of course  he knew 
but at the time  we felt their existence
was an insignificant variable 
insignificant to you  maybe 
but what about those people that
i put away with alternate futures 
  my god  if the country knew  
  the system would collapse 
  i believe in that system 
  do you really 
you wanna bring it down 
you will bring it down
if you manage to kill your victim 
that ll be the most spectacular public
display of how precrime didn t work 
  i m not gonna kill anybody 
  hold that thought 
  why should i trust you 
  you shouldn t trust anyone 
certainly not the attorney general 
who wants it all for himself 
and not the young federal agent 
who wants your job 
not even the old man who just wants
to hang on to what he created 
don t trust anyone 
just find the minority report 
you said the minority report
is destroyed 
the record is destroyed 
the original report still exists 
i designed it so the report is stored
in a safe place  but not declared 
what safe place is that 
the safest place there is 
where is it 
inside the pre cog who predicted it 
all you have to do
is download it  darling 
that s all  huh 
just walk into precrime 
get into the temple   
   somehow tap into these pre cogs
and download this minority report 
  if you have one 
  and then walk out 
actually  you ll have to run out 
but yes  that s what you have to do 
you re insane 
or you think i am 
i ll get eye scanned a dozen times
before i get within 1o miles of precrime 
sometimes in order to see the light 
you have to risk the dark 
as a policeman  
excuse me  as a former policeman   
   i m sure that you know
all sorts of people   
   who can help you out
in this regard 
it s funny how all
living organisms are alike 
when the chips are down 
when the pressure is on   
   every creature
on the face of the earth   
   is interested in one thing
and one thing only 
its own survival 
find the minority report 
how do i even know which one has it 
hineman  it s always in the more gifted
of the three 
which one is that 
the female 
fletcher  we ve got three men
in a room  the victim is here   
   john is here  and this
unidentified male  at the window 
the adjacent building suggests
public housing  which means  
  there s thousands like this one 
  they re everywhere 
but he doesn t go there to kill crow
for another 22 hours 
  this is chief anderton s space 
jad  casey  it s okay 
  he s not here 
  he ll be back 
  i doubt that 
  what happened to you 
i m betting
he s somewhere in the sprawl 
he s smart enough to go
where billboards can t id him 
there s fewer consumers 
which means fewer scanners 
  why won t he just run 
  because he thinks he s innocent 
we concentrate on the sprawl 
we do fly overs in ships 
with two spyder teams on the ground 
thermal scan the entire area  read
anything with eyes and a heartbeat 
where is she 
 man screams 
man  started blowing buttons for no
reason whatsoever  and i knew that 
this damn cold 
don t worry  i could cut open your
chest and sew a dead cat in there   
   you wouldn t get an infection  not
with the antibios i ll shoot into you 
that s comforting 
you do understand i can t just
give you new irises 
please  don t touch 
because the scanners would read the
new scar tissue  alarms will go off   
   and large men with guns will appear 
what was that 
what was that 
  it s anesthesia  it s all downhill  
  you always sneak up on your patients 
you wouldn t break the hand
of a violinist before the concert 
please  relax 
all i m trying to tell you is that i ll
have to remove your eyes completely 
i know 
  i have to replace them with new ones 
  i know  but i wanna keep the old ones 
  why 
  because my mother gave them to me 
what s it to you 
you can t resell them 
whatever you say  it s your money 
 speaks in swedish 
let me introduce my gorgeous
assistant  miss van eyck 
 toilet flushes 
 woman sings in swedish 
 eddie mumbles 
  this is not a lot of money 
  it s all that i could safely move 
eddie

i was a plastic surgeon

in burn victims  mostly women 
  i put you away 
  yeah  you did 
you made those tapes 
they were performance pieces 
  you set your patients on fire 
  i put them out 
some not as quickly as others  but
let s change the subject  shall we 
the future s so much more interesting
than the past  don t you think 
miss van eyck 
i m afraid she s already smitten 
she only has eyes for you 
i know what you re thinking  john 
how can i do what i do now 
let s say that i spent an awful lot
of time in the prison library 
that was a great way to avoid the more
unpleasant aspects of prison life 
confinement was
a real education  a real   
   eye opener 
 speaks in swedish 
for true enlightenment 
there s nothing quite like   
   well  let s say  taking a shower
while this large fellow   
   with an attitude you can t
knock down with a hammer   
   whispers in your ear   oh  nancy  
that was a lot of fun 
thank you for putting me there   
   and giving me the opportunity to
get to know myself so much better 
and now to return the favor 
witwer  this your work 
lara  yes 
i like it 
  how do you take your coffee 
  cream and sugar 
  i don t have any cream  sorry 
  just sugar then

i had to ask 
  i don t have any sugar either 
  thank you 
  he hasn t tried to contact you 
  no 
did he ever mention the name
leo crow 
no  but i don t talk
to john much anymore 
  so you haven t seen his apartment 
  that was our apartment 
have you been there recently 
it s full of these 
  how long has he been doping 
  since right after we lost our son 
  you mean after he lost your son 
  it was nobody s fault 
but john was with him
at the public pool 
you said in your divorce papers
that john tried to kill himself 
  it wasn t a suicide attempt 
  what was it then 
the fbi found something
that belonged to my son  a sandal 
john was upset  he  
he took out his gun
and watched home movies 
  he shot  
  this is all in your statement 
he shot a hole in the ceiling  so what 
you lose your son 
let s see how well you handle it 
lamar thinks you left john because he
lost himself in precrime instead of you 
i left him because every time
i looked at him  i saw my son 
every time i got close to him 
i smelled my little boy 
that s why i left him 
and now you can leave 
don t take the bandages off
for 12 hours 
if you take them off before then 
you ll go blind  understand 
in the fridge  there s milk 
greta made you a sandwich 
make sure you drink a lot of water

tour guide  the precrime program
began in 2046 with a federal grant 
and now  nine years later 
d c  is the safest city in america 
  get down 
  why  because precrime works 
precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives 
what happens now is the verification
and protection of future victims 
can we see the pre cogs 
they have such a powerful gift 
they re kept in peaceful seclusion   
   so as not to be distracted 
this display should give you some idea
of what their daily life is like 
the pre cogs get over
8 million letters every year 
children  wow 
  that s more than santa claus gets 
each pre cog has their own bedroom 
tv and weight room 
it s wonderful to be a pre cog 
my mom s new boyfriend
came over again last night 
he s just not very intelligent 
my mom wouldn t let me eat upstairs 
i had to listen to him go on and on 
anderton

without anyone knowing 
well  there s still the other two 
the other two can still function  right 
they re a hive mind  it takes all three
for their predictive abilities to work 
they can t see murders anymore 
agatha  she s the key 
she s the one they listen to   
   the one with the most talent 
  she takes care of the other two 
  jesus 
wally  please bring her back

let go of the gun 
you re not gonna kill me 
  goodbye  crow 
  anderton  wait a sec   
 screams 
woman 1  did you see it 
man  stay back 
woman 2 
what s happening down there 
woman 3 
murder 
murder  murder 
witwer 
doesn t make sense 
if you were a child killer 
would you leave these photos out 
anderton might have found them 
  what kind of cop were you before this 
  treasury agent 
  this will be your first murder scene 
  yeah 
i worked homicide before federal 
this is an orgy of evidence 
  know how many orgies i had as a cop 
  how many 
none 
this was all arranged 
tv announcer  the first murder in the
six years of the precrime experiment 
 phone rings 
tv announcer 
sadly enough  this failure was human 
the protection team
simply didn t get there in time 
but the murder itself happened exactly
as the pre cogs predicted it would 
today s event put a human face
on the precrime system 
celeste  danny witwer s on the phone 
he says it s important 
lamar 
  what 
witwer  there s something wrong 
  we re chasing the wrong man 
  what 
i don t wanna say over the phone 
meet me at anderton s 
we recovered that
from leo crow s hotel room 
burgess  i remember when i gave this
to him  back in baltimore 
witwer 
please  sir 
tell me what you have 
this is the murder of a woman
named anne lively 
john told me about this 
you got this from containment 
yes  this is from the twins 
arthur and dashiell 
agatha s stream was missing 
this one is from the cyber parlor 
anderton downloaded this directly
from agatha  rufus riley recorded it 
  it s the same prevision 
  not quite 
look at the surface wind
across the water  watch the ripples 
moving away from shore 
now the second image  the one from
containment that art and dash saw 
watch the water 
the wind s changed 
the ripples are moving the other way 
this murder s taking place
at two different times 
anderton was watching this
right before he was tagged 
he told me about
the missing data stream 
  he was concerned you might find it 
  he was right  i did 
it was inside of agatha 
so the question is  why would someone
want this erased from the data file 
danny  just tell me
what you re thinking 
i m thinking someone
got away with murder 
how 
jad told me that sometimes the pre cogs
see the same murder more than once 
  it s called an echo 
  jad called it pre cog déjà vu 
we teach the techs to identify
and disregard them 
yeah  but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo 
what if he was looking at a completely
different murder altogether 
i don t understand 
all you d have to do is hire someone
to kill anne lively   
   like a drifter  a neuroin addict 
someone with nothing to lose 
precrime stops the murder
from taking place   
   haloes the killer  takes him away 
but then  right then  someone else   
   having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes   
   commits the murder
in exactly the same way 
technician takes a look  thinks he s
looking at an echo  erases it 
it d have to be someone with access
to the previsions in the first place 
  someone fairly high up 
  shh 
do you know what i hear 
nothing 
no footsteps up the stairs 
no hovercraft out the window 
no clickety click of little spyders 
do you know why 
because right now 
the pre cogs can t see a thing 
 gun fires 
agatha 
can you see  it s beautiful 
  where are we going 
anderton  someplace safe 
 phone rings 
  burgess 
  lamar  it s lara 
burgess  yes  lara 
  you have to help him 
  is he there 
  yes 
is the pre cog with him 
  yes 
  keep them there  i m on my way 
please don t tell danny witwer 
i don t trust him 
burgess 
i won t say a word 
you just don t let john leave 
all right 
he s no killer  lamar 
i know 
agatha 
it s cold 
anderton 
lara  this is agatha 
you remember when i would read
tom sawyer to you and sean 
he got so scared when tom and becky
were lost in the cave 
i gotta sit down 
i gotta figure this out 
i gotta figure this out 
anderton 
they used sean 
they wanted me to think
crow killed him 
but he didn t 
he didn t 
why would they set you up 
because i found out about her 
about who 
  how could i not have seen this 
  seen what 
anne lively 
agatha 
dr  hineman once said 
 the dead don t die   
   they look on and help  
remember that  john 
agatha 
sean 
he s on the beach now   
   toe in the water 
he s asking you to come in with him 
he s been racing his mother
up and down the sand 
there s so much love in this house 
he s 10 years old 
he s surrounded by animals 
he wants to be a vet 
you keep a rabbit for him 
a bird and a fox 
he s in high school 
he likes to run  like his father 
he runs the two mile
and the long relay 
he s 23 
he s at a university 
he makes love
to a pretty girl named claire 
he asks her to be his wife 
he calls here and tells lara 
who cries 
he still runs   
   across the university and
in the stadium  where john watches 
oh  god  he s running so fast 
just like his daddy 
he sees his daddy 
he wants to run to him 
but he s only 6 years old 
and he can t do it 
and the other man is so fast 
there was so much love in this house 
i want him back so bad 
so did she 
can t you see 
she just wanted her little girl back 
but it was too late 
her little girl was already gone 
she s still alive 
she didn t die 
but she s not alive 
anderton 
agatha 
just tell me   
   who killed your mother 
who killed anne lively 
i m sorry  john

john anderton 
by mandate of the d c 
precrime division   
   i m placing you under arrest for the
murders of leo crow and danny witwer 
wally 
that s it 
that s my girl 
i was so worried about you 
did he hurt you 
i missed you so much 
it s okay  wally s here 
wally s here 
you re a part of my flock now  john 
welcome 
it s actually kind of a rush 
they say you have visions   
   that your life flashes
before your eyes   
   that all your dreams come true 
this is all my fault 
there was nothing anyone could do 
i thought you might want
to have those 
i haven t worn this in years  i wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight 
you look great 
i knew he was having trouble
for some time  yet i did nothing 
  the guy from usa today is here 
  tell him not now 
  he just wanted a few minutes before  
  not now 
  i thought you were retiring 
  well  i was 
but this incident with john made me
realize the fragility of all this 
this is john s legacy
as much as it is my own 
now i have an obligation
to protect that 
lara  i know how difficult
this is for you 
but maybe you can find
some closure in the fact   
   that john finally found
the man who killed your son 
who s anne lively 
  who 
  anne lively 
john was talking about her
right before they took him 
i don t know who that is 
john said something about him being
set up because he found out about her 
  well  we know why john was tagged 
  he also said crow was a fake 
and witwer  he was killed with
john s gun inside john s apartment 
do you know the reason why
john came here to work for you 
  sean 
  yes 
he came here to work for you
because he thought   
   if he could just stop
that kind of thing from happening   
  i understand 
  no  i don t think you do 
sir  they wanna start
the press conference in two minutes 
lara   
   john was the best cop i ever knew   
   and  in some ways 
also the best man 
but the scars he carried around   
well  i know he d want us to honor
the good things we remember about him 
and i also know why he married you 
you re as stubborn as he is 
  lamar   
  do you know how to tie one of these 
could you please give me a hand 
i m all thumbs  as you see 
listen  i ll tell you what i ll do 
first thing monday 
i ll look over the witwer evidence 
and i ll have gideon
run the containment files   
   see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of  
what did you say her name was 
anne lively 
but i never said she drowned 
  sir  the press conference is starting 
burgess  i ll be right there 
we ll talk about this later 
perhaps tomorrow 
i ll come by the cottage 
 organ music plays 
i d like a word with my husband 
you re not authorized 
how did you get in here 
thank you 
ladies and gentlemen  lamar burgess 
director of the new national precrime 
on behalf of your staff 
we present you with this 
  congratulations  sir 
burgess  my god 
how did you get this 
i padded your expense account
for six months 
revolvers like this one
were given to generals   
   at the end of the civil war
by their troops 
the cylinders were loaded
with five gold plated bullets   
   to symbolize the end
of the destruction and death   
   that had ripped the country apart
for five years 
ladies and gentlemen 
with precrime going national   
   maybe we can all look forward
to a time when none of us   
   will have to discharge
another firearm ever again 
now enjoy yourselves 
enjoy yourselves  that s an order 
does this mean we can finally use
the lake house on weekends 
 phone rings 
hello 
yes  right away 
  excuse me  so sorry 
woman  excuse me 
  sir 
burgess  yes 
sir  you have an emergency call
on your private line 
yes  this is burgess 
anderton  hello  lamar  i just wanted
to congratulate you  you did it 
you created a world without murder 
everyone wants your name on a hat 
can you sign these 
all you had to do was kill someone
to do it 
 phone rings 
a room  jad 
jad  it s lara  john needs a favor 
  what are you talking about 
anderton  agatha s mother  anne lively 
just a junkie who had a kid once
and had to give her up  but surprise 
she cleaned herself up 
and she wanted her daughter back 
she wanted agatha 
jad  you getting this  it s from the
female only  no time or incident data 
it isn t the future 
it already happened 
anderton  the problem was  without
agatha  there was no precrime 
she s the strongest of the three 
without agatha  you had nothing 
you wouldn t be where you are now 
standing there  signing autographs 
cop  what are you doing 
  what are you doing with that 
knott  what you up to  big man 
  think before you send that 
knott 
slow down 
anderton  you had to get rid of anne
lively  which presented a problem 
how can you kill her
without the pre cogs seeing it 
simple  use a system
you control against her 
you hired someone to kill her  knowing
the pre cogs would see that murder 
you lured anne lively
out to the lake   
   with the promise of reuniting her
with her daughter 
where s my daughter 
where 
run 
run 
 crowd gasping 
anderton  when you were all alone 
you killed her yourself   
   in the same way the pre cogs
predicted your john doe would kill her 
you made the real murder
look like an echo   
   knowing the tech would do what
he was trained to do  disregard it 
anne lively became
just another missing person 
so  what are you gonna do  lamar 
what are you gonna do 
 gasps 
we got a red ball 
think about the lives
that little girl has saved 
think about the lives
that little girl has saved 
think of all the lives she will save 
she could have saved sean 
don t you ever say his name 
you used the memory of my dead son
to set me up 
you used the memory of my dead son
to set me up 
you knew that would
drive me to murder 
  what are you gonna do now  lamar 
anderton  what are you gonna do now 
  how are you gonna   
  shut me up 
forgive me  john 
forgive me  john 
anderton 
lamar 
it s over 
the question you have to ask is 
what are you gonna do now 
no doubt the pre cogs have
already seen this 
no doubt 
you see the dilemma  don t you 
if you don t kill me  pre cogs were
wrong and precrime is over 
if you do kill me  you go away   
   but it proves the system works 
pre cogs were right 
so  what are you gonna do now 
what s it worth 
just one more murder 
you ll rot in hell with a halo  but
people will still believe in precrime 
all you have to do is kill me 
like they said you would 
except   
   you know your own future   
   which means you can change it
if you want to 
you still have a choice  lamar 
like i did 
yes  i have a choice   
   and i made it 
forgive me  john 
 gun fires 
forgive me 
forgive me  my boy

anderton  in 2054  the six year
precrime experiment was abandoned 
all prisoners were unconditionally
pardoned and released   
   although police departments
kept watch on many of them for years 
agatha and the twins   
   were transferred
to an undisclosed location
