i thought they stopped the murder
thats just an echo
precog déjà vu if you will
the really bad ones
the precogs see over and over again
wally erase the incoming
narrator
imagine a world without murder
i lost my best friend
i lost my aunt
i lost my dad
i lost my father
i lost my wife
narrator six years ago the homicide
rate had reached epidemic proportions
it seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed
but instead of one miracle we
were given three the precognitives
within just one month
under the precrime program
the murder rate in the district
of columbia was reduced 90
they were waiting for me
he was gonna rape me
i was going to be stabbed
right here
narrator precrime effectively
stopped murder in our nations capital
in the six years of our experiment
there hasnt been a single murder
narrator
and now precrime can work for you
we want to make certain
that every american
can bank on the infallibility
of the system
and to ensure that what keeps us safe
will also keep us free
precrime it works
man 1 it works
woman 1 it works
man 2 it works
woman 2 it works
it works
children
precrime it works
narrator on april 22 vote yes
on the national precrime initiative
man
whats the matter cant sleep
anderton just need a little clarity
man true that
you want the customary clarity or
the new and improved kind of clarity
anderton
give me the new stuff
man new and improved clarity
clarity clarity yes indeed
anderton
come on come on
dont bust my balls youve only given
me four and some of these are duds

john john john

to sleep
and time to come
and take care of your wife
why dont you put the camera down
and come and watch the rain with me
no i promise ill make it
a memorable moment
put the camera down
or youre not getting anything tonight
siren wails
a gentleman at justice
wants to take this away from us
in a week people will vote
on whether or not
what weve been doing has been
a nobleminded enterprise
or a chance to change the way
this country fights crime
anderton i understand sir
burgess john
watch this danny witwer
the observer from justice
i met him yesterday
let him look around
answer his questions but watch him
yes sir
if theres any problem
make sure we know about it
anderton
i understand
fletcher precogs declare a killer
and their name is embedded in wood
since the shape and grain of each piece
is unique theyre impossible to forge
you understand the legalistic
drawback to precrime methodology
here we go again
im not with the aclu on this
but we arrest individuals
whove broken no law
they will
the commission is metaphysics
the precogs see the future
and theyre never wrong
but its not the future if you stop it
isnt that a fundamental paradox
yes
youre talking about predetermination
which happens all the time
whyd you catch that
it was gonna fall
anderton youre certain
yeah
but it didnt fall you caught it
preventing it doesnt change
the fact that it was going to happen
witwer
you ever get any false positives
someone intends to kill but doesnt
how do the precogs tell the difference
they dont see what you intend to do
only what you will do
why cant they see
rapes assaults suicides
because of the nature of murder
nothings more destructive to the
metaphysical fabric that binds us
than the untimely murder of a human
that wasnt walt whitman
iris hineman she developed precogs
designed the system and the interface
witwer speaking of interfacing
id love to say hello
to hineman
to them
anderton cops arent allowed inside
youve never been inside
we keep strict separation so that
no one can be accused of tampering
ill be the first one to go in then
maybe you didnt hear me
if its a question of authority
there is no question
you dont have any
i have a warrant in my pocket
that says different
show it to me
sure
witwer this investigation of precrime
and its personnel is conducted
under the direct supervision and
permission from the attorney general
im here as his representative
which means youre now operating
under my supervision
seems youve been left
out of the loop
fletcher
all right were ready lets go
hold it right there hold on
computer not cleared for access
eyedent john anderton approved
anderton wally
wally no no no no
danny witwer from justice
were to give him the run of the farm
i cant touch you
dont touch anything
wally you cant be in here
just answer his questions
witwer tell me how
theyre sleeping
sorry tell me how all this works
the photon milk acts as both a
nutrient supply and conductor
it enhances the images they receive
we call the female agatha
the twins are arthur and dashiell
we scan by way of optical tomography
whitelight pinpoints pulse
along the length of the headgear
and are reread after absorption
through their brain tissue
in other words we see what they see
they dont feel pain we keep
their heads stocked with dopamine
plus we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels
dont want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep
they cant be kept too awake either
anderton dont think of them as human
no theyre much more than that
science has stolen
most of our miracles
in a way they give us hope
hope of the existence of the divine
its interesting that some people
have begun to deify the precogs
precogs are patternrecognition filters
thats all
yet you call this room the temple
a nickname
the oracle isnt where
the power is anyway
the power is with the priests
even if they had to invent the oracle
you guys are nodding like you know
what hes talking about
well come on chief the way we work
changing destiny and all
were more like clergy than cops
jad
yeah
go to work all of you
sorry old habit
i spent three years at fuller seminary
before i became a cop
my father was proud
what does he think of your work
i dont know he was shot and killed
when i was 15 at our church in dublin
i know what its like
to lose someone close
nothings like the loss of a child
i dont have any children so i can
only imagine what that was like
to lose your son
in such a public place like that
now we can make sure that
kind of thing doesnt happen to anyone
tell me what it is youre looking for
flaws
there hasnt been a murder
in six years this system is
perfect i agree
if theres a flaw its human
it always is
john
wally
can you see
what happened her acth levels
just shot through the roof
whatd you do
anderton she grabbed me
impossible theyre not aware of us
in the milk all they see is the future
she looked straight at me
it could have been a nightmare
she spoke to me
to you
whatd she say
can you see
organ music plays
you the sentry
yes sir im gideon
youre chief anderton
the music relaxes the prisoners
i dont ever see you precops down here
am i in trouble
not yet
im interested in a murder
i got plenty of those kill type
drowning
that narrows it down
not too many in here for that
victims caucasian female
this about the justice department
im supposed to spruce up for a tour
they got tomorrow you like this tie
stop
roll back
there
shes a golden oldie one of our first
probably before your time
this is the composite of the three
thats right
combined data stream
based on all three previsions
just show me agathas data stream
for that
we go for a ride
anderton
my god
id forgotten there were so many
gideon theyd all be out there
killing people if it wasnt for you
look at them
look at how peaceful they seem
but on the inside busy busy busy
okeypokey
now that is one bad man
he drowned a woman named
anne lively out at roland lake
the killers a john doe
never identified
why is he still a john doe
why wasnt he idd from the eye scan
those are not his eyes he had them
swapped out to fool the scanners
you can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days
okay so you want
just the female prevision
anderton
thats right
we dont seem to have her data
try again
this is odd see
we have the two previsions we got
what art saw we got what dash saw
but agathas isnt here
probably just a glitch
tell me about the intended victim
this anne lively
looks like shes a neuroin addict
like our john doe here
address history
includes the beaton clinic
so she cleaned up
where is she now
i guess glitches come in twos
you finally crawl your way out
of one hole just to fall into another
uh what no
cant let you take that out of here
chief
its against the rules
anything else against the rules
careful chief you dig up the past
all you get is dirty
burgess the third prevision was what
kind of fuzzy or something
no the third prevision
agathas prevision wasnt there
thats not all there are a dozen more
cases with missing previsions
youd think wed have found
the cure for the common cold
celeste its stress
whats this
herbal tea with honey
i hate herbal tea
almost as much as i hate honey
just drink it
before i pour it in your lap
can i get you anything john
anderton no thank you
witwers scheduled for a tour
of containment tomorrow
yeah give him a tour
lara called me
what
shes worried about you
quite frankly so am i
im fine
i understand youve been spending
a lot of time in the sprawl
i go running down there
in the middle of the night
what if danny witwer
insisted on a full chem run
im fine
the minute precrime goes national
they are going to take it away
we wont let them
no
how is an old man and a cop on the
whiff ever going to stop them
my father once said to me
you dont choose the things
you believe in they choose you
theres a reason you are here
had precrime been in place earlier
your loss would have been prevented
remember the eyes
the eyes of the nation
are on us right now
im not the generation
anyone listens to
but people trust you when you
speak of your belief in precrime
they know that its a belief born of
pain not politics i understood that
i may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause
but now
your pain is hurting both of us
theyre not going to take it
away from us
i wont let them
witwer

by mandate of the district of columbia
im placing you under arrest for
anderton
go to sleep
witwer
you two stay with me
classical music plays
anderton gasps
anderton
dr hineman
hineman youre trespassing
i dont have visitors
coughs
that would be from the dolls eye
the vine
the baneberry that scratched you
during your illegal climb over my wall
its not a true dolls eye
its a little hybrid i designed
once the poison gets into your
bloodstream youll start to see
the most extraordinary display
of blue objects
this just isnt your week is it
chief anderton
im not a killer
hineman
you better drink this
soon you wont be able to swallow
and then youll be totally buggered
all of it
okay now take a minute
to right yourself
just what is it you think
i can do for you
you could tell me how someone
can fake a prevision
how would i know that
because you invented precrime
hineman chuckles
whats so funny
if the consequences of several genetic
mistakes and science gone haywire
can be called an invention
then i invented precrime
you dont seem proud
im not
i was trying to heal them
not turn them into something else
heal who
the innocents we use to stop the guilty
youre talking about the precogs
you think they came from a test tube
they are merely the ones who survived
i was doing genetic research
treating children of drug addicts
this was 10 years ago
when neuroin first hit the streets
it was impure not the engineered
cocktail popular among the educated
all of these kids were born with severe
brain damage most died before age 12
those few who survived
they had a gift
i call it a gift for them
it was more like a cosmic joke
they would wake up in the night
curled in the corner
screaming clawing at the walls
because when these children
closed their eyes at night
they dreamt only of murder
over and over one after the other
it didnt take long for us to realize
that the real nightmare was
that these dreams were about to come
true these murders were happening
you say some of the children died
so many of them
despite what we did for them
or maybe because of what we
did to them but it doesnt matter
its a perfect system now isnt it
anderton
im not going to commit murder
ive never met the man
im supposed to kill
and yet a chain of events has started
that will lead you to his murder
not if i stay away from him
can you avoid a man youve never met
you wont help
i cant help you nobody can
the precogs are never wrong
but occasionally
they do disagree
what
most of the time all three precogs
will see an event in the same way
but once in a while one of them will
see things differently than the others
jesus christ
why didnt i know about this
because these minority reports
are destroyed the instant they occur
why
for precrime to function there cant
be any suggestion of fallibility
who wants a justice system
that instills doubt
it may be reasonable
but its still doubt
are you saying
ive haloed innocent people
im saying that every so often
those accused of a precrime
just might have
an alternate future
does burgess know about this
about this minority report
i used to joke with lamar that
we were the parents of precrime
parents often see their children as they
want them to be and not as they are
answer my question does lamar
burgess know about the minority report
yes of course he knew
but at the time we felt their existence
was an insignificant variable
insignificant to you maybe
but what about those people that
i put away with alternate futures
my god if the country knew
the system would collapse
i believe in that system
do you really
you wanna bring it down
you will bring it down
if you manage to kill your victim
thatll be the most spectacular public
display of how precrime didnt work
im not gonna kill anybody
hold that thought
why should i trust you
you shouldnt trust anyone
certainly not the attorney general
who wants it all for himself
and not the young federal agent
who wants your job
not even the old man who just wants
to hang on to what he created
dont trust anyone
just find the minority report
you said the minority report
is destroyed
the record is destroyed
the original report still exists
i designed it so the report is stored
in a safe place but not declared
what safe place is that
the safest place there is
where is it
inside the precog who predicted it
all you have to do
is download it darling
thats all huh
just walk into precrime
get into the temple
somehow tap into these precogs
and download this minority report
if you have one
and then walk out
actually youll have to run out
but yes thats what you have to do
youre insane
or you think i am
ill get eyescanned a dozen times
before i get within 1o miles of precrime
sometimes in order to see the light
you have to risk the dark
as a policeman
excuse me as a former policeman
im sure that you know
all sorts of people
who can help you out
in this regard
its funny how all
living organisms are alike
when the chips are down
when the pressure is on
every creature
on the face of the earth
is interested in one thing
and one thing only
its own survival
find the minority report
how do i even know which one has it
hineman its always in the more gifted
of the three
which one is that
the female
fletcher weve got three men
in a room the victim is here
john is here and this
unidentified male at the window
the adjacent building suggests
public housing which means
theres thousands like this one
theyre everywhere
but he doesnt go there to kill crow
for another 22 hours
this is chief andertons space
jad casey its okay
hes not here
hell be back
i doubt that
what happened to you
im betting
hes somewhere in the sprawl
hes smart enough to go
where billboards cant id him
theres fewer consumers
which means fewer scanners
why wont he just run
because he thinks hes innocent
we concentrate on the sprawl
we do flyovers in ships
with two spyder teams on the ground
thermal scan the entire area read
anything with eyes and a heartbeat
where is she
man screams
man started blowing buttons for no
reason whatsoever and i knew that
this damn cold
dont worry i could cut open your
chest and sew a dead cat in there
you wouldnt get an infection not
with the antibios ill shoot into you
thats comforting
you do understand i cant just

lost himself in precrime instead of you

began in 2046 with a federal grant
and now nine years later
dc is the safest city in america
get down
why because precrime works
precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives
what happens now is the verification
and protection of future victims
can we see the precogs
they have such a powerful gift
theyre kept in peaceful seclusion
so as not to be distracted
this display should give you some idea
of what their daily life is like
the precogs get over
8 million letters every year
children wow
thats more than santa claus gets
each precog has their own bedroom
tv and weight room
its wonderful to be a precog
my moms new boyfriend

murder
murder murder
witwer
doesnt make sense
if you were a child killer
would you leave these photos out
anderton might have found them
what kind of cop were you before this
treasury agent
this will be your first murder scene
yeah
i worked homicide before federal
this is an orgy of evidence
know how many orgies i had as a cop
how many
none
this was all arranged
tv announcer the first murder in the
six years of the precrime experiment
phone rings
tv announcer
sadly enough this failure was human
the protection team
simply didnt get there in time
but the murder itself happened exactly
as the precogs predicted it would
todays event put a human face
on the precrime system
celeste danny witwers on the phone
he says its important
lamar
what
witwer theres something wrong
were chasing the wrong man
what
i dont wanna say over the phone
meet me at andertons
we recovered that
from leo crows hotel room
burgess i remember when i gave this
to him back in baltimore
witwer
please sir
tell me what you have
this is the murder of a woman
named anne lively
john told me about this
you got this from containment
yes this is from the twins
arthur and dashiell
agathas stream was missing
this one is from the cyber parlor
anderton downloaded this directly
from agatha rufus riley recorded it
its the same prevision
not quite
look at the surface wind
across the water watch the ripples
moving away from shore
now the second image the one from
containment that art and dash saw
watch the water
the winds changed
the ripples are moving the other way
this murders taking place
at two different times
anderton was watching this
right before he was tagged
he told me about
the missing data stream
he was concerned you might find it
he was right i did
it was inside of agatha
so the question is why would someone
want this erased from the data file
danny just tell me
what youre thinking
im thinking someone
got away with murder
how
jad told me that sometimes the precogs
see the same murder more than once
its called an echo
jad called it precog déjà vu
we teach the techs to identify
and disregard them
yeah but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo
what if he was looking at a completely
different murder altogether
i dont understand
all youd have to do is hire someone
to kill anne lively
like a drifter a neuroin addict
someone with nothing to lose
precrime stops the murder
from taking place
haloes the killer takes him away
but then right then someone else
having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes
commits the murder
in exactly the same way
technician takes a look thinks hes
looking at an echo erases it
itd have to be someone with access
to the previsions in the first place
someone fairly highup
shh
do you know what i hear
nothing
no footsteps up the stairs
no hovercraft out the window
no clicketyclick of little spyders
do you know why
because right now
the precogs cant see a thing
gun fires
agatha
can you see its beautiful
where are we going
anderton someplace safe
phone rings
burgess
lamar its lara
burgess yes lara
you have to help him
is he there
yes
is the precog with him
yes
keep them there im on my way
please dont tell danny witwer
i dont trust him
burgess
i wont say a word
you just dont let john leave
all right
hes no killer lamar
i know
agatha
its cold
anderton
lara this is agatha
you remember when i would read
tom sawyer to you and sean
he got so scared when tom and becky
were lost in the cave
i gotta sit down
i gotta figure this out
i gotta figure this out
anderton
they used sean
they wanted me to think
crow killed him
but he didnt
he didnt
why would they set you up
because i found out about her
about who
how could i not have seen this
seen what
anne lively
agatha
dr hineman once said
the dead dont die
they look on and help
remember that john
agatha
sean
hes on the beach now
toe in the water
hes asking you to come in with him
hes been racing his mother
up and down the sand
theres so much love in this house
hes 10 years old
hes surrounded by animals
he wants to be a vet
you keep a rabbit for him
a bird and a fox
hes in high school
he likes to run like his father
he runs the twomile
and the long relay
hes 23
hes at a university
he makes love
to a pretty girl named claire
he asks her to be his wife
he calls here and tells lara
who cries
he still runs
across the university and
in the stadium where john watches
oh god hes running so fast
just like his daddy
he sees his daddy
he wants to run to him
but hes only 6 years old
and he cant do it
and the other man is so fast
there was so much love in this house
i want him back so bad
so did she
cant you see
she just wanted her little girl back
but it was too late
her little girl was already gone
shes still alive
she didnt die
but shes not alive
anderton
agatha
just tell me
who killed your mother
who killed anne lively
im sorry john
but youre gonna have to run again
what
run
i love you
its okay
lara no no
youll be fine with them
lara no no
cop stay with me stay with me
lara john no
cop dont talk
john anderton
by mandate of the dc
precrime division
im placing you under arrest for the
murders of leo crow and danny witwer
wally
thats it
thats my girl
i was so worried about you
did he hurt you
i missed you so much
its okay wallys here
wallys here
youre a part of my flock now john
welcome
its actually kind of a rush
they say you have visions
that your life flashes
before your eyes
that all your dreams come true
this is all my fault
there was nothing anyone could do
i thought you might want
to have those
i havent worn this in years i wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight
you look great
i knew he was having trouble
for some time yet i did nothing
the guy from usa today is here
tell him not now
he just wanted a few minutes before
not now
i thought you were retiring
well i was
but this incident with john made me
realize the fragility of all this
this is johns legacy
as much as it is my own
now i have an obligation
to protect that
lara i know how difficult
this is for you
but maybe you can find
some closure in the fact
that john finally found
the man who killed your son
whos anne lively
who
anne lively
john was talking about her
right before they took him
i dont know who that is
john said something about him being
set up because he found out about her
well we know why john was tagged
he also said crow was a fake
and witwer he was killed with
johns gun inside johns apartment
do you know the reason why
john came here to work for you
sean
yes
he came here to work for you
because he thought
if he could just stop
that kind of thing from happening
i understand
no i dont think you do
sir they wanna start
the press conference in two minutes
lara
john was the best cop i ever knew
and in some ways
also the best man
but the scars he carried around
well i know hed want us to honor
the good things we remember about him
and i also know why he married you
youre as stubborn as he is
lamar
do you know how to tie one of these
could you please give me a hand
im all thumbs as you see
listen ill tell you what ill do
first thing monday
ill look over the witwer evidence
and ill have gideon
run the containment files
see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of
what did you say her name was
anne lively
but i never said she drowned
sir the press conference is starting
burgess ill be right there
well talk about this later
perhaps tomorrow
ill come by the cottage
organ music plays
id like a word with my husband
youre not authorized
how did you get in here
thank you
ladies and gentlemen lamar burgess
director of the new national precrime
on behalf of your staff
we present you with this
congratulations sir
burgess my god
how did you get this
i padded your expense account
for six months
revolvers like this one
were given to generals
at the end of the civil war
by their troops
the cylinders were loaded
with five goldplated bullets
to symbolize the end
of the destruction and death
that had ripped the country apart
for five years
ladies and gentlemen
with precrime going national
maybe we can all look forward
to a time when none of us
will have to discharge
another firearm ever again
now enjoy yourselves
enjoy yourselves thats an order
does this mean we can finally use
the lake house on weekends
phone rings
hello
yes right away
excuse me so sorry
woman excuse me
sir
burgess yes
sir you have an emergency call
on your private line
yes this is burgess
anderton hello lamar i just wanted
to congratulate you you did it
you created a world without murder
everyone wants your name on a hat
can you sign these
all you had to do was kill someone
to do it
phone rings
aroom jad
jad its lara john needs a favor
what are you talking about
anderton agathas mother anne lively
just a junkie who had a kid once
and had to give her up but surprise
she cleaned herself up
and she wanted her daughter back
she wanted agatha
jad you getting this its from the
female only no time or incident data
it isnt the future
it already happened
anderton the problem was without
agatha there was no precrime
shes the strongest of the three
without agatha you had nothing
you wouldnt be where you are now
standing there signing autographs
cop what are you doing
what are you doing with that
knott what you up to big man
think before you send that
knott
slow down
anderton you had to get rid of anne
lively which presented a problem
how can you kill her
without the precogs seeing it
simple use a system
you control against her
you hired someone to kill her knowing
the precogs would see that murder
you lured anne lively
out to the lake
with the promise of reuniting her
with her daughter
wheres my daughter
where
run
run
crowd gasping
anderton when you were all alone
you killed her yourself
in the same way the precogs
predicted your john doe would kill her
you made the real murder
look like an echo
knowing the tech would do what
he was trained to do disregard it
anne lively became
just another missing person
so what are you gonna do lamar
what are you gonna do
gasps
we got a red ball
think about the lives
that little girl has saved
think about the lives
that little girl has saved
think of all the lives she will save
she could have saved sean
dont you ever say his name
you used the memory of my dead son
to set me up
you used the memory of my dead son
to set me up
you knew that would
drive me to murder
what are you gonna do now lamar
anderton what are you gonna do now
how are you gonna
shut me up
forgive me john
forgive me john
anderton
lamar
its over
the question you have to ask is
what are you gonna do now
no doubt the precogs have
already seen this
no doubt
you see the dilemma dont you
if you dont kill me precogs were
wrong and precrime is over
if you do kill me you go away
but it proves the system works
precogs were right
so what are you gonna do now
whats it worth
just one more murder
youll rot in hell with a halo but
people will still believe in precrime
all you have to do is kill me
like they said you would
except
you know your own future
which means you can change it
if you want to
you still have a choice lamar
like i did
yes i have a choice
and i made it
forgive me john
gun fires
forgive me
forgive me my boy

anderton in 2054 the sixyear
