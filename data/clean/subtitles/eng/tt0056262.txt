to make a body feel at home 
  oh  there s nothing halfway  
  about the iowa way to treat you  
  when we treat you  
  which we may not do at all  
  there s an iowa kind of special  
  chip on the shoulder attitude  
    we ve never been without  
    that we recall  
  we can be cold as  
  the falling thermometer in december  
  if you ask about our weather in july  
  and we re so by god stubborn  
  we can stand touching noses  
  for a week at a time  
  and never see eye to eye  
  but what the heck  
  you re welcome  
  join us at the picnic  
    you can eat your fill  
    of all the food you bring yourself

  we can stand touching noses  
  for a week at a time  
  and never see eye to eye

  if your crop should happen to die

shh  hill s the name this trip 
professor harold hill 
why didn t you tell me you were coming 
i didn t know i was  myself 
i never thought i d find a slicker
like you here in the sarsaparilla belt 
this is where i work 
  you mean you live in this town 
  yeah  i like it too 
it s not brooklyn  new york 
not the city of homes and churches but  
brooklyn 
marce  this isn t even dubuque 
hey  are you hiding out or what 
just not as light on my feet as i used
to be when i was shilling for you 
you re in a business that got
a lot of close shaves 
i got a nice job now 
i got a nice girl 
ethel toffelmier 
that s the boss s niece 
so you ve gone legitimate  huh 
i knew you d come to no good 
what are you selling now 
i heard you were in steam automobiles 
  i was 
  what happened 
  somebody actually invented one 
  no 
so now i m back at the old stand 
not boys  bands 
they got no call for boys  bands
in this town 
anything iowa folk don t have
they do without 
they got music 
they got a gramophone down
to the barber shop 
and a stuck up librarian gives piano 
  gives piano 
  a maiden lady 
she ll expose you
before you unpack this bag 
maiden lady librarians who give piano
are a specialty of mine 
just point her out
the minute you see her 
yeah  i ll back her into a corner
and breathe on her glasses 
thar she blows 
i ll do it but i won t like it 
that s not the librarian 
that s mrs  shinn  the mayor s wife 
good afternoon  mrs  shinn 
don t change the subject 
something the matter 
the same thing is the matter as is
always the matter here  look 
is this the sort of book
you give my daughter 
this ruby hat of omar kay ay ay  
i am appalled 
i did recommend it 
it s beautiful persian poetry 
it s dirty persian poetry 
people lying out in the woods
eating sandwiches 
getting drunk
with pitfall and with gin 
drinking directly out of jugs
with innocent young girls 
  no daughter of mine  
  mrs  shinn 
the rubaiyat of omar khayyam
is a classic 
it s a smutty book  like most of
the others you keep here  i daresay 
honestly  mrs  shinn 
wouldn t you rather have your daughter
read a classic than elinor glyn 
what elinor glyn reads
is her mother s problem 
just you keep your dirty books
away from my daughter 
you sure picked yourself a town 
let me take you over to the hotel 
not sure i m going to stay yet 
first i got to find a way to get into
some of these iowa boodlebags 
greg  it ain t easy 
all i need is an opening 
you remember the pitch  what can i use 
what s new around here 
the other day a farmer brought in
an egg had 3 yolks in it 
was in the paper 
that s exciting  all right 
no  what do you talk about 
there s the weather  of course 
when it s in season 
now  marce  i need some ideas     
     if i m going to get your town
out of the serious trouble it s in 
river city ain t in any trouble 
we ll have to create some 
must create a desperate need
in your town for a boys  band 
why is everyone rubbering
into the billiard parlor 
marcellus 
they just got in a new pool table 
harold 
they must have seen one before 
no  just billiards 
that ll do it 
just sit where you are 
and remember     
     if you see that music teacher    
are you mr  dunlop 
either you re closing your eyes to a
situation you don t wish to acknowledge   
     or you are not aware
of the caliber of disaster   
     indicated by the presence of
a pool table in your community 
  well  you got trouble  my friend  
  right here  i say  
  trouble right here in river city  
  why  sure  i m a billiard player  
  certainly mighty proud to say  
  i m always proud to say it  
  i consider that the hours i spend  
  with a cue in my hand are golden  
  help you cultivate horse sense  
  and a cool head and a keen eye  
  you ever take and try to give  
  an ironclad leave to yourself  
  from a three rail billiard shot   
  but just as i say  
  it takes judgment  brains and maturity  
  to score in a balk line game  
  i say that any boob  
  can take and shove a ball in a pocket  
  and i call that sloth  
  the first big step on the road  
  to the depths of degrada   i say first  
  medicinal wine from a teaspoon  
  then beer from a bottle  
  the next thing you know your son is  
  playing for money in a pinch back suit  
  and listening to some big  
  out o  town jasper  
  hearing him tell about  
  horserace gambling  
  not a wholesome trotting race  no  
  but a race where they set down  
  right on the horse   
  like to see some stuck up jockey boy  
  setting on dan patch   
  make your blood boil   
  well  i should say   
  now  friends  
  let me tell you what i mean  
  you got 1  2  3  4  
  5  6 pockets in a table  
  pockets that mark the difference  
  between a gentleman and a bum  
  with a capital b and that  
  rhymes with p and that stands for pool  
  and all week long your river city  
  youth ll be frittering away  
  i say your young men ll be frittering  
  frittering away their noontime  
  suppertime  chore time too  
  get the ball in the pocket  
  never mind getting dandelions pulled  
  or the screen door patched  
  or the beefsteak pounded  
  never mind pumping any water  
  till your parents are caught  
  with the cistern empty on a saturday night  
  and that s trouble  
  yes  you got lots and lots of trouble  
  i m thinking of the kids in the  
  knickerbockers  shirttail young ones  
  peeking in the pool hall window  
  after school  
  you got trouble  folks  
  right here in river city  
  trouble with a capital t and that  
  rhymes with p and that stands for pool  
  now i know all you folks  
  are the right kind of parents  
  i m going to be perfectly frank  
  would you like to know what kind of  
  conversation goes on  
  while they re loafing around that hall   
  they ll be trying out bevo  
  trying out cubebs  
  trying out tailor mades  
  like cigarette fiends  
  and bragging all about  
  how they re going to cover up  
  a telltale breath with sen sen  
  one fine night they leave the pool hall  
  headin  for the dance at the armory  
  libertine men and scarlet women  
  and ragtime  
  shameless music  
  that ll grab your son  
  your daughter  with the arms of  
  a jungle animal instinct mass teria  
  friends  the idle brain  
  is the devil s playground  trouble   
    we got trouble  
    right here in river city  
  with a capital t and that rhymes with p  
  and that stands for pool  
  we ve surely got trouble  
  right here in river city  
  got to figure out a way to keep  
  the young ones moral after school  
our children s children
gonna have trouble
mothers of river city 
heed that warning before it s too late 
watch for the telltale signs
of corruption 
the minute your son leaves the house     
     does he rebuckle his knickerbockers
below the knee 
is there a nicotine stain
on his index finger 
a dime novel hidden in the corn crib 
is he starting to memorize jokes
from captain billy s whiz bang 
are certain words
creeping into his conversation 
words like       
like  swell  
and  so s your old man  
if so  my friends       
  you got trouble  
  right here in river city  
  with a capital t and that rhymes with p  
  and that stands for pool  
  we surely got trouble  
  right here in river city  
  remember the maine  plymouth rock  
  and the golden rule  
  our children s children  
  gonna have trouble  
  oh ho  we got trouble  
  we re in terrible  terrible trouble  
  that game with the 15 numbered balls  
  is the devil s tool  
  oh  yes  we got  
  trouble  trouble  trouble

what  dear 
you ll find it in balzac 
excuse me for living 
but i never read it 
  neither has anyone else in this town  
  there you go again  
  with the same old comment  
  about the low mentality  
  of river city people  
  and taking it all too much to heart  
now  mama  as long as the       
  madison public library  
  was entrusted to me  
  for the purpose of improving  
  river city s cultural level  
  i can t help my concern that  
  the ladies of river city  
  keep ignoring  
  all my counsel and advice  
but  darling 
  when a woman has a husband  
  and you ve got none  
  why should she take advice from you  
  even if you can quote  
  balzac and shakespeare  
  and all them other  
  highfalutin greeks   
  if you don t mind my saying so  
  you have a bad habit  
  of changing every subject  
  no  i haven t changed the subject  
  i was talking about that stranger  
    what stranger   
    with the suitcase  
  who may be your very last chance  
  do you think that i d allow  
  a common masher  now really  mama   
  i have my standards  
  where men are concerned  
  and i have no intention    
  i know all about your standards  
  and if you don t mind my saying so  
  there s not a man alive  
  who could hope to measure up  
  to that blend of paul bunyan   
  saint pat and noah webster  
  you ve concocted for yourself  
  out of your irish imagination  
  your iowa stubbornness  
  and your library full of books

very patient and understanding 
i m patient

you ll see the glitter
of crashing cymbals     
     and hear the thunder of rolling drums
and the shimmer of trumpets  tam tada 
and you ll feel something akin
to the electric thrill i once enjoyed     
     when gilmore     
     pat conway  the great creatore     
     w c  handy     
     and john philip sousa     
     all came to town
on the very same historic day 
  76 trombones led the big parade  
  with 110 cornets close at hand  
  they were followed by rows and rows  
  of the finest virtuosos  
  the cream of every famous band  
  76 trombones caught the morning sun  
  with 110 cornets right behind  
  there were more than a thousand reeds  
  springing up like weeds  
  there were horns  
  of every shape and kind  
  there were copper bottom timpani  
  in horse platoons  
  thundering  thundering  
  all along the way  
  double bell euphoniums  
  and big bassoons  
  each bassoon  
  having his big fat say  
  there were 50 mounted cannon  
  in the battery  
  thundering  thundering  
  louder than before  
  clarinets of every size  
  and trumpeters who d improvise  
  a full octave higher than the score  
whoo 
  76 trombones hit the counterpoint  
  while 110 cornets blazed away  
  to the rhythm of hark  hark  hark   
  all the kids began to march  
  and they re marching still right today  
there ain t nothing like a brass band
to stir a fella up 
when i hear them trombones     
it s them peck horns that really does it 
i bet you estherville
ain t got anything like it 
or even des moines

it s only fair to tell you
i m not impressed by your credentials     
     which i ve not seen 
nor your manners  which i have 
harold 
it s a golden key  as it were 
your key to the magic world of music 
none of our family s ever been
what you d call musical

four weeks for the uniforms

uniforms and instruction books 
why warm up if
you re not going to pitch 
you can t pass yourself off as
a music professor  you can t read music 
i have a revolutionary new method 
the think system 
you don t bother with notes 
my boy   
     someday reading music is
going to be absolutely obsolete 
i hope it s soon  in four weeks
these people will want to hear music 
but when the uniforms arrive
they forget everything else 
at least long enough for me
to collect and leave 
this is a refined operation  son 
i ve got it timed down to
the wave of the brakeman s hand     
     on the last train out of town

but he left all the books to her 
she was seen going and coming
from his place 
oh  yes  that woman made       
  brazen overtures  
  with a gild edge guarantee  
  she had a golden glint in her eye  
  and a silver voice  
  with a counterfeit ring  
j  ust melt her down and you ll reveal  
  a lump of lead as cold as steel here  
  where woman s heart should be

we got chicken croquettes tonight 
no  i m not thinking about food 
going to line yourself up
a little canoodling 
no  i got something to look up
at the library 
from what i ve heard       
let me fix you up with
myrtle toffelmier  ethel s sister 
real nice girl 
teaches sunday school 
no wide eyed  eager  wholesome 
innocent sunday school teacher for me 
that kind of gal spins webs
no spider ever   listen  boy 
a gal who trades on all that purity
merely wants to trade
my independence for her security
  the only affirmative she will file  
  refers to marching down the aisle  
  no golden glorious gleaming  
  pristine goddess  
  no  sir  
  for no diana do i play faun  
  i can tell you that right now  
  i snarl  i hiss  
  how can ignorance be compared to bliss   
  i spark  i fizz  
  for the lady who knows what time it is  
  i cheer and i rave  
  for the virtue i m too late to save  
  the sadder but wiser girl for me  
  no bright eyed blushing breathless  
  baby doll baby  
  no  sir  
  that kind of child ties knots  
  no sailor ever knew  
  i prefer to take a chance  
  on a more adult romance  
  no dewy young miss who keeps resisting  
  all the time she keeps insisting  
  no wide eyed wholesome innocent female  
  no  sir   
  why  she s the fisherman  
  i m the fish  you see  
plop 
  i flinch  i shy  
  when the lass with  
  the delicate air goes by  
  i smile  i grin  
  when the gal with a touch of sin  
  walks in  
  i hope and i pray  
  for a hester to win just one more  a   
  the sadder but wiser girl s  
  the girl for me  
  the sadder but wiser girl for me  
it s all right 
i know everything and it makes
no difference 
  i don t know what you re talking about 
  mr  madison 
you were probably very young 
anyone can make a mistake 
what 
no apologies  no explanations 
you see  i ll only be in town
a short while    
     and the sadder but wiser girl for me 
would you please make
your selection and leave

  what do you want to take out 
  the librarian 
crowd 
shh

the librarian 
you re not listening  marian

     rian  
  oh  what can i do  my dear  
  to catch your ear   
  i love you madly  madly  
  madam librarian  
  marian  
  heaven help us  
  if the library caught on fire  
  and the volunteer hose brigade men  
  had to whisper the news to  
  ma     
     rian  
  madam libra     
shh 
     rian  
  oh  what can i say  my dear  
  to make it clear   
  i need you badly  badly  
  madam librarian  
  marian  
  if i stumbled and i busted  
  my whatchamacallit  
  i could lie on your floor unnoticed  
  till my body had turned to  
  car     
     rion  
  madam libra     
     rian  
  now in the moonlight  
  a man could sing it  
  in the moonlight  
  and a fellow would know  
  that his darling  
  had heard every word of his song
  with the moonlight  
  helping along  
  but when i try in here  
  to tell you  dear  
  i love you madly  madly  
  madam librarian  
  marian   
  it s a long lost cause  
  i can never win  
  for the civilized world accepts  
  as unforgivable sin  
  any talking out loud  
  with any librarian  
  such as ma     
     rian  
  madam libra     
     rian  
tommy 
men 
shh

  madam librarian  
  marian

     rian  
  hey  professor 
  hello  tommy 
  i think i got it 
  yeah 
my music holder for
a marching piccolo player 
  oh 
  i still haven t worked out     
     a couple of minor flaws 
even edison doesn t always
get it right the first time 
when you hold it tight enough
to keep the music steady     
     you cut off the circulation
and you can t wiggle your fingers 
and meanwhile     
     you could go blind 
i d say it still needs a little work 
like to check out
a few prospects with me 
hey 
you mean you re going in there 
i don t see any quarantine sign 
gee  i got to hand it to you  professor 
see you later 
i hope 
just a minute here 
are you soliciting 
you haven t got a license 
why  no  mr  mayor 
mr  mayor  i collect doorbells 
and this specimen has an
unusual tone quality  
flattery will not avail you 
soliciting is statutory in this county 
malfeasance without a permit 
why haven t you been over at city hall 
  i must have just missed you 
  none of your alibis 
  your hand  isn t that amazing 
  hmm 
what  what 
that spread of the little finger 
it s hereditary 
  it is  what does that mean 
  mm 
it means your son s little finger   
     is perfectly situated for
the spit valve on a flügelhorn 
  is that good 
  good 
it means america finally has
an artist who can     
     flügel the  minute waltz 
in 50 seconds 
  how can i get one of those horns 
  sign here 
yes  sir 
fine  fine 
that ll be 17 dollars import fee 
just think  i could ve
missed this whole thing 
my son could ve  
i haven t got any son 
oh  george 
i never had a son 
  i never said you did 
  what do you know 
i d certainly know if i gave you a son 
  i m not talking to you 
  who are you talking to 
  him 
  who 
never mind 
zaneeta  call dr  pyne for your father 
harold  yes  my dear mrs  paroo 
you must realize     
     that only one
out of every 78 adults    
     has a ganglion that reaches
the ligature clear down to the apex 
this automatically turns your
entire face into an amazing embouchure 
i never had a sick day
in my life  doctor 
ah  professor 
professor  what shall i do for it 
no  you don t understand 
i m trying to tell you 
you have the facial characteristics     
     of a cornet virtuoso 
if your boy has that same firm chin   
     and those splendid cheek muscles 
oh ho ho      
by george 
not that he d ever really be great 
is that so 
and in the name of
st  bridget  why not 
all of the really great
cornet players were irish 
o clark  o mendez  o klein      
but  professor  we are irish 
no 
no  really  that clinches it 
sign here  madam 
your boy was born to play the cornet 
fine  fine 
that ll be 7 dollars earnest money 
nothing more due until
the opening of band practice 
thank you  and i ll need your boy s
measurements for his uniform 
mrs  paroo 
his uniform 
  oh  yes  
  ah 
  winthrop 
  well  hello there  son 
why  certainly  his uniform 
and there won t be
a penny due until delivery 
which gives him four weeks to enjoy 
anticipate  imagine at no cost 
never allow the demands of tomorrow     
     to interfere with the pleasures
and excitements of today 
would it have a   
  a       
  a       
a stripe  why  certainly  my boy 
a wide  red stripe down each side 
what do you think of that 
you ll have to excuse winthrop 
we can t get him to say
three words a day 
not even to us 
if you can get him to play
in that band     
     you ll have st  michael s
own way with you 
but if anybody can do it 
i bet you can  heh heh 
thank you 
you ve a gift of the blarney about you 
no mistaking that 
  where are you from  my boy 
  gary  indiana 
i knew it 
where d you say 
gary  indiana 
gary conservatory was my alma mater 
was she now 
yes  indeed 
gold medal class of  05 
  gary  indiana  
what a wonderful name 
named for elbert gary
of judiciary fame
  gary  indiana  
  as a shakespeare would say  
  trips along softly  
  on the tongue this way  
  gary  indiana  
  let me say it once again  
  gary  indiana  
  that s the town that knew me when  
  now if you d like to have  
  a logical explanation  
  how i happened on  
  this elegant syncopation  
  i will say without  
  a moment of hesitation  
  there is just one place  
  that can light my face  
  gary  indiana  
  not louisiana  
  paris  france  
  new york or rome  
  but gary  indiana  
  gary  indiana  
  my home sweet home  
  gary  indiana  
  gary  indiana  
  my home sweet home  
  ah 
  whoa 
mama 
how do you do  miss paroo 
how do you do 
of course  paroo 
i thought the name sounded familiar 
  i ve been trying to see you 
  he wants to put winthrop in the band 
marian 
we re not interested 
but marian dear  the boy might have
his father s musical gift 
he does have my ganglion  you know 
your husband is musical 
i d like to talk to him 
do you always burst into people s homes
prying into personal affairs 
we re not interested 
marian 
there s one for and one against 
now  why not let
the boy s father decide 
the boy s father is dead 
anything else 
i am sorry 
but all the more reason
he should have this 
my brother is an unhappy child who can t
understand why his father was taken away 
would you care to explain it to him 
he s been brooding for two years 
and as for your musical tricks 
go into business with a carnival man    
     who sells painted watches
and glass diamond rings 
harold 
musical tricks  now  miss paroo 
i have a feeling she likes the idea 
a little cautious 
but i admire that in a woman 
i ll be back later in the week 
i do hope you ll excuse marian 
she s not really  
please  don t you worry about a thing 
i m sure that at heart 
she s as lovely as yourself 
good day to you  widow paroo 
  has he gone 
  he has  and i hope not forever 
darling  don t you ever think
of your future 
now  mama  a girl s future
doesn t depend on encouraging     
     every fast talking 
self centered   
     woman chasing traveling man
who comes to town 
all right  darling  all right 
only it s a well known principle that
if you keep the flint in one drawer     
     and the steel in the other
you ll never strike a fire 
  mama 
  a fine looking man 
and educated 
gary  indiana conservation
class of  aught five 
that he claims his commodity is music
does not  in this case  impress me 
nor does anything else about him 
i give up 
at your age  if you don t mind my asking 
what are you waiting for 
not for ed griner  who backs me
into the history shelf     
     every time he s in the library 
he does 
or ed gammage who has the buggy
with the removable back seat 
if you re waiting for a knight in shining
white armor to come riding up the street      
i m not waiting for that either 
then what are you waiting for 
marian paroo 
if you don t mind my asking   
     don t you ever think
about being in love 
being in love 
  being in love  
  used to be my favorite dream  
  oh  yes  
  i ve been in love  
  more than anybody else has  
  i guess  
  my first love  
  heroically ran the streetcar  
  i tingled at every clang clang  
  next i fell for the principal  
  but  oh  that teacher who sang  
   in the gloaming   
  knee deep in love  
  what a lovely dream  
  and yet somehow  
  me deep in love s  
  only half of what  
  i m longing for now  
  i still love my being  
  in love with someone  
  but tell me why couldn t there be  
  somebody being in love  
  with me   
  all i want is a plain man  
  all i want is a modest man  
  a quiet man  
  a gentle man  
  a straightforward and honest man  
  to sit with me  
  in a cottage somewhere  
  in the state of iowa  
  and i would like him to be  
  more interested in me  
  than he is in himself  
  and more interested in us  
  than in me  
  and if occasionally he d ponder  
  what makes shakespeare  
  and beethoven great  
  him i could love till i die  
  him i could love  
  till i die  
  being in love  
  what a lovely dream  
  and yet  
  somehow  
  being in love s  
  only half of what  
  i m longing for now  
  and so then  
  tonight i ll be in there dreaming  
  and hoping that someday there ll be  
just once 
  somebody being in love  
  with me

how do you get any right around here 
aiding and abetting the swindling
activities of this cymbal salesman 
you know what i see written

now get out 
get out  you wild kid 
papa  please

if i could make you understand  
well  you can t 
and thanks for the buggy ride 
i read that book you gave me
from cover to cover   
     and didn t find a thing 
mr  mayor  please  
i ll settle your hash    
     as soon as i get these premises
off my oldest girl 
  yes 
  but in the meantime     
      i m vouching for tommy djilas 
he has the confidence
of every kid in town 
you ll be waiting to shake his hand     
     when our band
plays its first concert 
by that time 
my fine young feathered    
     my feathered young 
my feathered fine  
never mind 
oliver  jacey  ewart  olin 
i want that man s references
and i want them tonight 
he s slipperier than
a mississippi   sturgeon 
i think mayor shinn behaved abominably 
and it was wonderful of you 
sticking up for tommy djilas 
  oh  that was nothing 
  yes  it was 
a man can t go back on his principles
because personal risk is involved 
what does the poet say 
a coward dies 1000 deaths 
a brave man    
     only 500 
  something like that 
  thank you 
get his papers or get him in jail 
i couldn t make myself clearer     
     if i was a buttonhook
in well water 
i want to talk to you
about winthrop s cornet 
a beautiful instrument 
hammered brass  mother of pearl keys 
but he never touches it  he said
you told him it wasn t necessary 
you must understand  
something about a  think system  
he says if he thinks the  minuet in g 
he can play it 
i admit it s still
in the experimental stages 
to a seasoned professional like yourself
it may seem ludicrous 
you mustn t say that 
  i mustn t 
  no 
throughout history the true
originator is always laughed at 
i hope you don t class me with
those small minds who ridiculed  
  galileo 
  yes  and his conception of the heavens 
or fulton 
  yes  or columbus 
  and his conception of the egg  
globe 
the one thing one must remember 
no matter who one is     
     or what one is working for     
     one can do anything
if one puts one s mind to it 
miss marian   
     if one could only tell you
how much you ve done for one 
i would deem it a great privilege
to talk with you again 
well  all i said  
may one call upon you some evening 
any night this week 
good evening  gentlemen 
sorry  professor 
but we got our orders 
we all been deputized

ah  what s that thing you got

combination pocketknife and tool kit

and six sturdy steel blades 
blessed martin of tours 
one spear blade  one sheep s foot blade 
one small pen blade

it was a present 
from harold 
  professor hill

      i better learn to whittle and spit 
i got the spitting down pretty good 
winthrop  what do you and harold

and sometimes just plain talk 
he talks about his hometown 
gary  indiana 
he said he d take me there someday 
isn t that nice 
he taught me a song about it
with hardly any  s s in it 
  gary  indiana  
  gary  indiana  
  let me say it once again  
  gary  indiana  
  that s the town that knew me when  
  if you d like to have  
  a logical explanation  
  how i happened on this  
  elegant syncopation  
  there is just one place  
  that can light my face  
  gary  indiana  
  not louisiana  
  paris  france  
  new york or rome  
    but  
    gary  indiana  
  gary  indiana  
  my home sweet home  
all right  enough of that 
come along  now 
you still have to change
for the sociable 
do the shinns live
around here somewhere 
the shinn home is on east elm 
this is west elm 
mm  criminy 
oh  i see you re the
piano teacher here in town 
you must know about this fellow hill
forming a boys  band here 
don t let that worry you no more 
i got the goods on him in spades 
that swindling  two bit
thimblerigger 
that s why i got to see shinn 
i m just passing through     
     and number 8 only makes
a 15 minute water stop and  
ooh 
i wish it was 20 
sure could concentrate five minutes
on you  girlie girl 
who are you 
name s charlie cowell 
anvil salesman 
but now i ve got heavier things
on my mind 
i ve got to protect the good name
of the traveling fraternity from hill 
mr  cowell 
you re making a big mistake 
mistake  my old lady s corset cover 
he s been the raspberry seed     
     in my wisdom tooth just long enough 
he spoiled lllinois for me 
but he won t spoil iowa 
you re a music teacher 
you didn t see through him 
  he s no more professor  
  i know all about that 
bandleaders are always called professor 
it s an academic courtesy 
he s a fine director  
now wait a minute 
fine director 
tell me  you heard one note
of music from any band 
well  no  but  
but nothing  girlie girl 
he never formed a band in his life 
and you think he ever will 
not on your previous existence 
just listen a minute  
i d like to 
i d like to do more than that
if i had the time 
sure got the inclination 
but i got to leave this dynamite
with somebody on the way to the depot 
bye  girlie girl  i ll see you
next time i come through 
you ll never make that train
at the depot  catch it at the crossing 
i ve got to leave word  and i can see
you ain t the one to leave it with 
wait a minute 
mr  cowell 
you don t know me very well yet 
is that an invitation  girlie girl 
no  i mean  i don t know you 
i d need more time anyway 
what i mean is     
     as well as i d like to 
oh  there s no trouble there    
     girlie girl 
i ve never met a man    
     who sells anvils before 
it s really quite     
     different 
takes a real salesman 
i can tell you that 
anvils have a limited appeal  you know 
what am i doing 
if i miss that train  i ll lose my job 
and i got to leave word about hill 
leave word with me 
not on your tintype  girlie girl 
how do i know
you ll deliver these letters 
try me 
there s your train  run for it 
you double dealing  
who do you think you re protecting 
that guy s got a gal
in every county in lllinois     
     and he s taken it away from
every one of them  that s 102 counties 
not counting the piano teachers
like you he cozies up to    
     just to keep your mouths shut 
neither one of you have
heard the last of me  girlie girl 
  i ll pop the question  
  lida rose  i m home again  rose  
  without a sweetheart to my name  
  good evening  miss marian  
  lida rose  how everyone knows  
  that i am hoping you re the same  
mrs  paroo 
marian 
marian dear  who was you talking   
why  professor hill 
mrs  paroo  the top of the evening 
miss marian 
you and marian come up and set 
i ve got some jelly on the stove 
there s no jelly on the stove 
well  i ll put some on 
  shall we  set   as your mother said 
  really  i don t  
you did ask me to call  remember 
did i  i didn t mean anything 
i m not suggesting
your invitation inferred     
     anything but academic enlightenment 
the think system 
i ve been by your house
to explain it to you     
     but there always seem
to be people around 
ladies mostly  i thought 
yes  mrs  squires
and several of the other ladies 
i m glad 
i wouldn t want anyone beating my time 
 you wouldn t  
 no  ma am  
it s evidently not
the convenient evening 
i ll see you at the sociable 
professor hill  is it true
that you ve had 100   
  what i m trying to say is  
  yes 
i was wondering   
     how you developed the think system 
the think system 
oh  the think system 
it s quite simple  really 
it s as simple as whistling 
no one had to develop an
elaborate technique for whistling 
you simply think the tune up here   
     and it comes out clearly here 
now just suppose you try this yourself 
i ll take your word for it 
why don t we all sit down 
are all music teachers
as dense as i am 
all music teachers 
i daresay you ve met dozens 
maybe even a hundred 
  well  
  are they all as fascinated as i   
     with the think system 
some more and some less 
one young lady had thought
up the same system 
she showed me a few refinements 
i see 
have i said something wrong 
please don t let me keep you 
you must have more important
things to do    
     than explain the think system to me 
nope  can t think of one 
come  let s sit 
i must be very dull company
for a man of your experience 
now where d you ever get
an idea like that  heh heh 
one hears rumors about
traveling salesmen 
oh  now  you mustn t
believe everything you hear 
after all  one even hears rumors
about librarians 
i presume you re referring
to uncle maddy 
  uncle maddy 
  mr  madison  my father s best friend 
no matter what they say 
he left that library job to me     
     so mother  winthrop and l
could have security 
surely  you don t believe  
no  but that s just what i m saying 
why do you suppose
people start rumors 
narrow mindedness  jealousy 
jealousy mostly  i guess 
exactly 
and jealousy mostly starts
rumors about traveling salesmen 
what have you heard 
oh 
nothing about you personally 
it s just   
     you know  generally 
what have you heard generally 
just that  
but of course 
it stands to reason that disappointment
and jealousy can lead to  
well  take you  for instance 
your attentions to customers    
     and teachers might easily be
misconstrued  mightn t they 
i mean now  honestly  mightn t they 
and as you say  if a salesman
or somebody were jealous    
     they could be downright lies 
now  couldn t they 
  what could 
  rumors and things 
of course 
it goes to show  you should never
believe everything you hear 
i mean  if you just discuss things 
i d be delighted to discuss     
     anything in the world with you 
but couldn t we do it sitting down 
you do sit 
your knees bend and all 
we could sit on the steps  i suppose 
or on the large hollow log
over at the footbridge 
no  i couldn t do that 
i ve never been to the footbridge
with a man in my life 
just to talk 
i have to dress for the sociable 
then meet me there in 15 minutes 
no  i can t 
please 
some other time 
maybe tomorrow 
please 
oh  my dear little librarian 
you pile up enough tomorrows
and you ll collect     
     nothing but a lot
of empty yesterdays 
i don t know about you     
     but i d like to make today
worth remembering 
oh       
so would i  
the footbridge     
      15 minutes 
fifteen minutes 
marian  mama 
  what  
i told the professor i d meet him
at the footbridge in 15 minutes 
glory be and the saints be praised 
  it works 
  what works 
i been using the  tink  system
on you from the parlor 
any of you people mayor shinn 
please  you got to clear this area 
mrs  shinn wants
to start the entertainment 
no  we want to dance 
wait ll you see the new steps
professor hill taught us 
mr  washburn 
my group is ready to perform 
  start her out 
  okay  what ll it be 
 the shipoopi  
  now a woman who ll kiss on the  
  very first date is usually a hussy   
  and a woman who ll kiss on the  
  second time out is anything but fussy  
  but a woman who ll wait  
  till the third time around  
  head in the clouds  
  feet on the ground  
  she s the girl he s glad he s found  
  she s his shipoopi  
  shipoopi  shipoopi  shipoopi  
  the girl who s hard to get  
  shipoopi  shipoopi  shipoopi  
female singers 
  but you can win her yet  
  walk her once  
  just to raise the curtain  
  walk around twice  
  and you make for certain  
  once more in the flower garden  
  she will never get sore  
  if you beg her pardon  
  do re mi fa so la si do  
  si la so fa mi re do  
  squeeze her once  
  when she isn t looking  
  if you get a squeeze back  
  that s fancy cooking  
  once more for a pepper upper  
  she will never get sorev
  on her way to supper  
  do re mi fa so la si do

miss marian  you re late 
  you said 15 minutes 
  not that kind of late  i meant       
i d say about     
     26 years late 
it took you all this time to get
to the footbridge with a fella 
if you want to know the truth 
it was almost longer 
  oh 
  halfway here    
      i nearly turned back 
i suppose i m not
the first person to discover   
     a girl doesn t think clearly
under the spell of your salesmanship 
you surely don t think i ve
been trying to sell you anything 
oh  no 
you ve given me something 
that s why i had to come 
  i don t recall giving you  
  yes 
something beautiful 
that s why i came 
and i m so glad 
please don t be afraid
i expect too much more 
one can t expect
a traveling salesman to stay put 
there ve been many ports of call
and there ll be many more 
still  i can be grateful
for what you ve left behind 
for me 
marian  
  there were bells  
  on the hill  
  but i never heard them ringing  
  no  i never heard them at all  
  till there was you  
  there were birds  
  in the sky  
  but i never saw them winging  
  no  i never saw them at all  
  till there was you   
  and there was music  
  and there were wonderful roses  
  they tell me  
  in sweet fragrant meadows  
  of dawn  
  and dew  
  there was love  
  all around  
  but i never heard it singing  
  no  i never heard it at all  
  till there was you  
  there was love  
  all around  
  but i never heard it singing  
  no  i never heard it at all  
  till there was  
  you  
marian 
there s lots you don t know about me 
i m not asking 
excuse me 
i m expecting a telegram from rudi friml 
this could be it 
who s the salesman  looks like
she s selling and you re buying 
i have to keep her off balance 
she s as off balance as
a catboat in a hurricane 
it s just until those uniforms arrive 
they re here and the kids are in them 
tommy passed out the uniforms
and collected most of the money 
now he s pretending there s
a band practice at the lumberyard 
  what time s the freight train go 
  9 40 from the junction 
it isn t even 8 30 yet 
you better cheese it now while you can 
i came up through the ranks
on this skirmish 
i won t resign without my commission 
now go on  beat it 
never a peaceful moment
in the music business 
now where were we 
you were going to tell me
what i don t know about you 
yeah 
but we don t have to go
into that right now 
of course not 
we never have to go into that  harold 
madam librarian  you are a lady
from the ground up

doing research lately 
but she did plenty of it
when you first came here

i have to get something
to draw around my shoulders 
you knew all the time 
i ve known since
three days after you came here 
i tore this out of the indiana journal 
i meant to use it against you 
now i give it to you with all my heart 
but if you knew  
  it s your sweet  hello  dear   
  that sets me up  
  and it s your  got to go  dear

fellow that organized the band 
there ain t any band 
there ain t never been a band 
there ain t never going to be a band 
unless you hunt this man down now

roped and hogtied  if you have to 
and don t let him give you the slip 
all right  after him

i ll only be a minute 
  while 110 cornets played the air  
  then i modestly took my place  
  as the one and only bass  
  and i oompahed up and down the square  
marian 
  good night  my someone  
  good night  my love  
  with 110 cornets right behind  
marian 
  our star is shining  
  its brightest light  
  there were horns of every shape and    
  sweet dreams be yours  dear  
  if dreams there be  
marian 
  while 110 cornets played the air  
  i wish i may  
  and i wish i might  
  now good night  
  my someone  
  good night   
he s not in there 
try the livery stable 
try the freight depot 
let s go  greg 
the flivver s in the alley 
all cranked up 
they re onto you 
that anvil salesman   
     is running all over town
spilling everything 
come on 
run  professor 
they re talking about tar and feathers 
i ve looked all over for winthrop 
he s run away 
maybe he s in his room 
it s not often i m at a loss for words  
it s all right 
don t you know that 
you don t owe me a word 
not a word 
now hurry  please 
greg 
he s not around here  folks 
let s try by the creamery 
  whoa  hold on a minute  son 
  i m not your son  leave me go 
not until i talk to you a minute 
i won t listen 
you wouldn t tell the truth anyway 
  i would too 
  would tot 
tell you anything you want to know 
can you lead a band 
no 
  are you a big liar 
  yes 
  are you a dirty  rotten crook 
  yes 
then leave me go  you big liar 
you wanted the truth  didn t you 
i m bigger than you 
and you re getting it all 
so just stop wiggling 
now      
there are two things
you re entitled to know 
one  you re a wonderful kid 
i thought so from the first 
that s why i wanted you in the band     
     so you d stop moping around
and feeling sorry for yourself 
what band 
i always think there s a band  kid 
winthrop  what s the other thing
i m entitled to know 
that s none of your business 
come to think of it 
i wish you never came to river city 
no  you don t  winthrop 
sister  you believe him 
i believe everything he ever said 
winthrop 
but he promised us 
i know what he promised us 
and it all happened just like he said 
the lights  the colors 
the cymbals and the flags 
where was all that 
in the way every kid in town
walked around all summer     
     and looked and acted 
especially you 
and the parents too 
does mama wish he d never come 
well  you do  don t you 
no  winthrop 
you d better go  harold  please 
go on  professor 
hurry up 
i can t go  winthrop 
why not 
well  for the first time in my life     
      i got my foot caught in the door 
there was love
all around
but i never heard it singing
no  i never heard it at all
till there was you 
marcellus 
greg 
greg  they re here 
run this way 
go on  professor  that way  that way 
shinn  and always remember 
fellow river city zeeans     
      i did everything in my power
to prevent this dire     
     happening from   
     happening 
fourscore  
how will you get our money back 
that professor collected almost
 300 on uniforms just tonight 
i haven t seen a uniform or my boy
either since just after supper 
he s a kidnapper 
that s a fine situation we have here 
shinn 
fourscore  
just a minute 
virtue has triumphed 
the sword of restibution    
     has cut down    
     professor harold hill 
and if there are those 
as i ve heard    
     who are melting tar
and plucking feathers     
      i will not say them nay 
i should think some of you could forget
your everlasting iowa stubbornness     
     long enough to remember what
this town was like before harold hill came 
do you 
  well  do you 
  hold up  there 
and then after he came 
suddenly there were things to do     
     and things to be proud of     
     and people to go
out of your way for 
surely some of you can be grateful
for what this man has brought to us 
i d think you d want to admit it 
you re wasting a great deal of time 
if there s a person in this hall    
     who doesn t want this man
hill tarred and feathered     
     let him  by god  stand up 
eulalie  sit down 
and the rest of you  who are standing
there like shropshire sheep 
maybe you can remember other things 
like what you paid for uniforms     
     technical instruction books
and band instruments 
with the understanding    
     your children would be taught
to play in a band 
well  where s the band 
where s the band  
 whistle blows 
crowd 
oh       
no  i couldn t 
now  think  men 
think 
 playing discordant tune 
that s my barney 
that tuba s my barney 
wonderful  barney 
that s eddie  that s eddie s clarinet 
oh  oh 
linus 
play to me  son 
play to me 
davey 
that s my davey 
oh 
  76 trombones led the big parade  
  with 110 cornets close at hand  
  they were followed by rows and rows  
  of the finest virtuosos  
  the cream of every famous band  
  76 trombones caught the morning sun  
  with 110 cornets right behind  
  there were more than a thousand reeds  
  springing up like weeds  
  there were horns  
  of every shape and kind  
  there were copper bottom timpani  
  in horse platoons  
  thundering  thundering  
  all along the way  
  double bell euphoniums  
  and big bassoons  
  each bassoon  
  having his big fat say  
  there were 50 mounted cannon  
  in the battery  
  thundering  thundering
