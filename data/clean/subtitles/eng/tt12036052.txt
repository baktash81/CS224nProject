salt wind sucked water bodies

shani senses leads way
close
shanis instincts water right
deep gorge surprise

quelea
gaia remembers birds leading mother water many years ago
perhaps could
follow birds passage high main river
theres small stream
enough wet mouths keep parched young ones going
shani learned important lesson gaia today
little birds big lifesavers
quelea arent settling drink
gaia gambles following
small stream feeder zambezi river
magnificent point
mosioatunya smoke thunders

gaia urges
together shani gaia shield young sides
making harder crocodiles reach
leave crocodiles behind face new even worse danger
water getting deeper current much stronger
