police department in california
he works with us with the governors
office everybody loves him
hes getting an award from the
association of security agencies
its understandable
that youre distraught
and looking for justice

that you want it so much
that you saw your killer in a man
who bore a slight resemblance
we run into this
all the time in police work
wheres he getting that award
dont
flint your friend dewald is foul

paper us mint quality
thats what was in that truck
you wanted to follow the truck
back to la to find his print shop
its right here in wonder world
what is he raving on about
hes insane hes proved that
in wonder world
this place is as hightech
as nasa and nintendo combined
they got a hidden room under
this closed ride i was in there
thats why they were chasing me
my men were pursuing mr foley
because hes delusionary
and potentially dangerous
this room delusionary also
no there is a closed ride
which we use to
id better take a look at it
maybe wed better look at it
right here counterfeit bills
out of this machine
is this true
fraid so officer
fraid weve been
caught redhanded right ellis
fraid so
would you like to see them
first quality make a run donald
we call them wonder world dollars
redeemable for admission
rides souvenirs
its our big christmas promotion
were giving it away to elementary
schools across the country
you must be in on this
you supply equipment
he supplies paper right
they changed it
to this shit after i left
after we leave theyll put it back
whats this paper
ordinary rag
they switched it
i am tired
of these accusations officers
i want this man
arrested for public endangerment
could i speak with you a moment
god damn it we spent a fucking year
with our noses up dewalds ass
were this close to locking this up
and you piss all over us
our case is blown
youre going back to detroit
and if you werent a cop
id have you doing dead time

get on the plane
i got a wife three kids a mortgage
and a pension that wont cut it
that job at wonder world

axel i left as soon
as i got your call are you ok

because this note by itself
it just dont make no sense
this is important life and death
why would he even send that
not help i need to talk to you
nothing just this
oh shit fry must have found
some sample paper
he knew theyd kill him
so he sent it to you
theres a barcode
what does that mean
it used to belong to uncle sam
now we got evidence we can put
sanderson and dewalds ass in jail
i dont think so
i figured youd call uncle dave
here so we followed him
i actually was a real cop once
so i know how you assholes think
which is to say slowly
very slowly
so you were carrying the evidence
the whole time sherlock
heres the real ending of the story
lets see if you like it
we heard you were loose
you had a grudge against the park
i feared you might try
to harm our beloved uncle dave
so i raced over here as fast
as i could to try and stop you
but alas it was too late
get him all the way in the car
take it
take it
you worried about fingerprints
forget it
look at the gun its yours
give me your weapon
throw that gun in the street
close the door and get over there
hold on uncle dave damn it
dont you die on me man
i got an emergency out here
its a gut shot come on
that was uncle dave
pressure
90 over 40 and dropping
i got to get his pressure up
lets go guys
i need oxygen lets go
on three one two three
get an arterial line in him
any medical history
ive been shot before
but its no big deal
wheres the coffee machine
down the hall
this is an allcity alert for
a suspect in the thornton shooting
suspect is an
africanamerican male
you hear some black guy
shot uncle dave
no
come on lets get out of here
did you hear
somebody shot dave thornton
somebody shot uncle dave
is there a tv here
yes of course
authorities believe
that foley attacked uncle dave
in retaliation
for some personal rejection
the muchloved uncle dave is
undergoing surgery at this moment
according to hospital sources
the prognosis is bleak
how does a psycho like that
live with himself
janice axel get out of the park
theyre going to kill whoever
knows about roger frys note
janice cant come to the phone
right now can i take a message
if you do anything
itll be your fault
i want you at wonder world

if you dont show up here
in a halfhour
