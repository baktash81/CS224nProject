  isn t it possible you re mistaken 
that ellis dewald
just resembles todd s killer 
i made the guy in detroit 
it was dewald 
he s the head of the largest private
police department in california 
he works with us  with the governor s
office  everybody loves him 
he s getting an award from the
association of security agencies 
it s understandable
that you re distraught
and looking for justice 
not to mention revenge 
but isn t it just possible
that you want it so much
that you saw your killer in a man
who bore a slight resemblance 
we run into this
all the time in police work 
  where s he getting that award 
  don t 
flint  your friend dewald is foul 
i know he s foul 
and i m going to this awards show
to put some pressure on him 
maybe panic him
into doing something stupid 
axel  if you go

  detective foley

  i have no doubts 
nor do i have any ideas 
exactly two weeks ago 
detective foley 
roger fry  the park s
chief operating officer   
and my friend  disappeared 
roger fry designed the park  from the
landscaping to the concession stands 
  what do you mean  disappeared 
  show him the note 
i received this interoffice
the day roger disappeared 
 this is important 
life and death  roger 
  what was so important 
  i don t know 
what was he doing
the day he disappeared 
he was probably doing
one of his usual inspections 
  this guy designed the whole park 
  yes 
  and he knew the place cold 
  of course 
so what are you thinking 
he must ve found something
someone didn t want him to find 
at wonder world 
what on earth could that be 
it s a place
of childhood innocence and fun 
and life and death 
you met uncle dave  uncle dave

and then you push this button 
and out it comes from the mechanism 
the brightest  blinding light
ever that you seeing

to help you

he went berserk 
he was firing a weapon in the park 
there are hundreds
of children around 
  they don t give oscars in prison

fulbright  secret service 
  i put you on a plane to detroit 
  you re gonna be glad i stayed 
i know what you re investigating 
it s right here 
yeah  and what am i investigating 
paper  us mint quality 
that s what was in that truck 
you wanted to follow the truck
back to la to find his print shop 
  it s right here in wonder world 
  what is he raving on about 
  he s insane  he s proved that 
  in wonder world 
this place is as high tech
as nasa and nintendo combined 
they got a hidden room under
this closed ride  i was in there 
that s why they were chasing me 
my men were pursuing mr  foley
because he s delusionary
and potentially dangerous 
this room  delusionary also 
no  there is a closed ride 
which we use to   
  i d better take a look at it 
  maybe we d better look at it 
right here  counterfeit bills 
out of this machine 
  is this true 
   fraid so  officer 
 fraid we ve been
caught red handed  right  ellis 
 fraid so 
would you like to see them 
first quality  make a run  donald 
we call them wonder world dollars 
redeemable for admission 
rides  souvenirs 
it s our big christmas promotion 
we re giving it away to elementary
schools across the country 
you must be in on this 
you supply equipment 
he supplies paper  right 
they changed it
to this shit after i left 
  after we leave they ll put it back 
  what s this paper 
  ordinary rag 
  they switched it 
i am tired
of these accusations  officers 
i want this man
arrested for public endangerment 
could i speak with you a moment 
god damn it  we spent a fucking year
with our noses up dewald s ass 
we re this close to locking this up 
and you piss all over us 
our case is blown 
you re going back to detroit 
and if you weren t a cop 
i d have you doing dead time
in leavenworth for life 
detective flint  he s yours 
let s go  axel 
make sure he doesn t
get on the plane 
i got a wife  three kids  a mortgage
and a pension that won t cut it 
that job at wonder world
is my retirement plan 
we re being followed 
it s the security guards
at wonder world 
they probably want to make sure
you get on that plane 
because of you  my future
is in real fucking jeopardy 
dewald is pissed  sanderson
won t think too highly of me 
hold up  stop the car 
  that liquor store  stop 
  what 
  oh  shit 
  wait 
it s all right  don t worry  i ll
get him  when i do  i ll kill him 
axel  i left as soon
as i got your call  are you ok 
i m fine  but i want you to think
back to the night fry disappeared 
  maybe you forgot something 
  no  why would you think that 
because this note by itself   
it just don t make no sense 
 this is important  life and death  
why would he even send that 
not  help  i need to talk to you  
nothing  just this 
oh  shit  fry must have found
some sample paper 
he knew they d kill him
so he sent it to you 
  there s a barcode 
  what does that mean 
it used to belong to uncle sam 
now we got evidence  we can put
sanderson and dewald s ass in jail 
i don t think so 
i figured you d call uncle dave
here  so we followed him 
i actually was a real cop once
so i know how you assholes think 
which is to say  slowly 
very slowly 
so you were carrying the evidence
the whole time  sherlock 
here s the real ending of the story 
let s see if you like it 
we heard you were loose 
you had a grudge against the park 
i feared you might try
to harm our beloved uncle dave 
so i raced over here as fast
as i could to try and stop you 
but alas  it was too late 
get him all the way in the car 
take it 
take it 
you worried about fingerprints 
forget it 
look at the gun  it s yours 
give me your weapon 
throw that gun in the street 
close the door and get over there 
hold on  uncle dave  damn it 
don t you die on me  man 
i got an emergency out here 
it s a gut shot  come on 
that was uncle dave 
  pressure 
  90 over 40 and dropping 
i got to get his pressure up 
let s go  guys 
i need oxygen  let s go 
on three  one  two  three 
get an arterial line in him 
any medical history 
i ve been shot before 
but it s no big deal 
  where s the coffee machine 
  down the hall 
this is an all city alert for
a suspect in the thornton shooting 
suspect is an
african american male

shot uncle dave 
  no 
  come on  let s get out of here 
did you hear 
somebody shot dave thornton 
  somebody shot uncle dave 
  is there a tv here 
yes  of course 
authorities believe
that foley attacked uncle dave
in retaliation
for some personal rejection 
the much loved uncle dave is
undergoing surgery at this moment 
according to hospital sources 
the prognosis is bleak 
how does a psycho like that
live with himself 
janice  axel  get out of the park
