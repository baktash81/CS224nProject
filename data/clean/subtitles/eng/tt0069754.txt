  mm hm 
  thank you 
 doorbell 
can i help you 
mrs  wadsworth 
oh  you re from welfare 
  come on in 
  thank you 
  what you say your name was 
  mrs  gentry  ann 
  go right in 
  thank you 
it was nice of you to call first 
most of you workers just pop in 
please sit down 
make yourself comfortable 
this is just a routine visit 
mrs  wadsworth 
but i m sure you re an old hand
at this sort of thing 
you might say so  after all these years 
let s see    when was the last time
you saw a worker  
oh  about six months ago 
we usually see one of you county people
about twice a year 
well  you know  er   
a worker will be glad to come more often 
if there s a need for it 
we re a very self sufficient family 
are you going to be baby s new worker 
i don t mind telling you  mrs  wadsworth 
i    i made a special effort
to get this assignment 
you did  now  why is that 
well  i heard about the case
from one of the other workers 
and it was impossible
not to be interested 
i see 
what is the composition
of the family now 
same as before 
no changes to speak of 
in other words  
you  your two daughters and your son 
baby  mm hm  we ve been living
in this house ever since he was born 
i notice you call him baby 
and the case history
doesn t show any other name  
  what is his real name 
   woman  just baby 
  i m germaine 
  my daughter  this is mrs  gentry  honey 
she s going to be baby s new worker 
nice to meet you 
  now  what about the family income 
  just what the county gives us for baby 
your daughters  are they employed 
uh  my daughters 
no  they help out the best they can 
but it doesn t come to too much 
alba gives tennis lessons
in the afternoon  and germaine   
once in a while  i do a tv commercial 
sometimes  i don t know
how we make ends meet 
but we always seem to manage 
isn t there any money
from your husband s pension 
  or his social security 
  well  how could there be 
 giggles  she thinks he s dead 
 laughing heartily  that man didn t die 
no such luck 
it happened just before baby was born 
when i needed him most 
he ran off and left us 
  but then  all that s in the record 
  oh  i m sure it is 
my husband was a very weak man 
mrs  gentry 
  no character 
  none at all 
and you ve had no contact with him
since he left 
as far as i m concerned 
he might as well be dead 
i understand how you feel 
mrs  wadsworth 
well  like all things 
some good came out of it 
we got used to being without a man 
  i d like to see baby before i leave 
   germaine  do you have to 
well  yes  i see all my clients 
why  ls there any reason i shouldn t 
no  of course not 
it s just that baby s taking
his afternoon nap 
unless you think ifs important 
 ann  oh  i ll be careful not to wake him 
besides  i m sure you know
that it s one of the basic requirements
of my job that i see everyone 
of course  as his new worker 
you should see him 
don t you think so  germaine 
nursery is this way 
 mrs  wadsworth  he gets the best care
in all the world  we all see to that 
 germaine talking sweetly to baby 
mm  chocolate 
 kicking table 
mind if i feed him 
 baby grizzles 
hi  baby  are you hungry 
now  open up  whoopsie 
are you hungry 
are you hungry  yes  come on   
 ann  you do this everyday 
mrs  wadsworth 
have to  or the muscles will go bad 
his legs seem perfectly normal 
i m surprised he doesn t walk 
you must have  er  quite a few clients 
mrs  gentry 
seems like baby s one of your favorites 
what gives you that idea 
well  this is your third time here
in a week 
i guess you re right 
he is of special interest to me 
but then  he s a pretty special baby 
 phone rings 
 typewriters clattering 
  you wanted to see me  mr  foley 
  yes  i did 
  oh  please sit down  ann 
  thank you 
oh  i see you ve been reading
my baby file 
under the circumstances 
i thought it would be best 
what circumstances 
ann  i ve been going through your reports
for the past few weeks 
you re not spending nearly enough time
with your emergency cases 
you ve been devoting yourself almost
exclusively to this wadsworth baby 
well  maybe i have 
but with very good reason 
ann  i m not telling you to drop it 
just ease off 
compromise 
mr  foley 
this case is full of compromise 
and indifference 
and criminal negligence 
and we re responsible 
ann  you exaggerate 
other workers have put time in
on this case 
and they ve come up
with no significant results 
none of those other workers spent enough
time on the case to accomplish anything 
  that s not true  one did   
  yes  one did 
and just when she was beginning
to make progress  she disappeared 
  people drop out of sight  it happens 
  not very often 
well  the police looked into it 
they were satisfied 
but i m not 
   ann laughing 
   germaine  don t let him go too high 
  he might fall out and get hurt 
  you re having a ball  aren t you 
   baby laughing 
  yeah  well  i am  too 
you know  he seems so intelligent 
germaine  so alert 
maybe  but when you ve been
around him some more 
you ll realize how limited he is 
you think so 
  i ought to know 
  ooh 
i have to clean up after him 
hey  that was fun  wasn t it 
let s play another game  i know what 
let s play with the ball 
let s play with the ball  yeah 
the ball  yeah  that ll be fun 
uh huh  ok 
get ready  get ready 
get ready to catch it 
i m gonna throw it 
there it goes 
well  that s a good job 
that s good  that was good  good boy 
you caught it  didn t you 
hey  let s try something else  ok 
i m going to roll the ball   
and i want you to gel it 
that s the way 
he s a good baby  he knows

bring it to ann 
oh  yes  that s a good baby 
he s such a sweet baby 
oh   
  oh  he s a smart baby 
  what s going on 
oh  i ve just been playing
with your brother 
you know  some of his responses
are really surprising 
any kid a couple of years old can do that 
but he can t do any more 
well  i m not so sure 
alba  isn t it time for baby s nap 
mm hm  i d better take him inside 
  come on  you 
   baby protests 
 he grizzles 
  he likes you 
  well  sure 
i like him 
i know somebody
who s not going to like it  not any of it 
now  come on  let s get inside 
i m getting sick
of this moth eaten old thing 
  come on 
   baby crying 
does she mean your mother 
pay no attention to alba 
she s always saying dumb things like that 
now  i m sure you have other clients to see 
i ll walk you to your car 
thank you 
you dress so beautifully  ann 
how do you do it
on a social worker s salary 
easy  by spending my whole salary 
of course  you have a husband
lo pay all the other bills 
your husband  tell me  what does he do 
uh    roger was an architect 
he  uh    he created some
of the finest buildings in the city 
did you say  was  
ann 
uh    when was the last time
baby  uh  had an examination 
why do we have to talk about baby
all the time 
we dam 
i d like to find out more about you 
well  there s really
not much to find out  i  er   
i lead a pretty conventional life 
let s see  i live in a nice house
with a marvelous husband 
an understanding mother in law 
that s about it 
do you like physical exercise 
sometimes 
i love to go hiking up in the mountains 
do you ever do anything like that 
unfortunately 
i don t have much free time 
well  maybe on a saturday
when you re not working 
oh  i usually spend saturdays with roger 
besides  i don t think
it would be much fun for you 
i mean  you d probably wind up
having to carry me 
you never know what you re missing
until you try it 
well  maybe  but i m a scorpio  
we re very cautious 
bye bye 
oh  when was the last time
baby was examined by a psychologist 
a psychological test to determine
his mental range and physical reactions 
we had all those tests when he was a baby 
but he must have had more tests
since then 
no  there didn t seem to be
any reason for it 
why 
oh  nothing in particular 
ll was just a thought 
you know  scorpios really aren t cautious 
just dangerous 
  bye bye 
   engine starts 
it s late  ann 
don t you think you should go to bed 
not yet  i want to finish these 
he was so beautiful 
we were so beautiful together 
why did it have to happen 
i just cannot accept it 
ann 
i won t let it be this way 
your son   
your son was everything to me 
i know 
 ann  it should have been me 
it should have been  it was my fault 
 woman  no  billy  you can t come over 
you know about the freak 
they don t like outsiders coming by 
i d only get in trouble  and you know it

 baby sobbing 
baby  baby  don t cry 
 i jazz playing on radio

i don t think you like me very much 
  i don t know you 
  well  you could get to know me 
actually  i m a very easy person to know 
i d like to be your friend  alba 
in a way  lhere s more to it than that 
i really need your friendship 
why 
you know how much
i want to help your brother 
so 
i can t do it without the cooperation
and support of the whole family 
has anyone been giving you any trouble 
no 
but that s not the same as having
your complete trust and confidence 
baby was born backwards 
he s been that way all his life 
  that s all there is to it 
   baby crying 
stop that  baby 
or i ll have to punish you 
  how do you punish him 
  when he s bad  he gets a spanking 
i think he s just hungry 
i know he s hungry 
how dumb do you think i am 
but i have to wait for mama to get back 
why don t you get him a bottle 
i ll keep an eye on him 
i m sure you would 
but i m not supposed to leave him alone 
well  he wouldn t be alone  i d be here 
you did say your mother
was coming home soon 
mm hm  you d better wait 
mama wants to see you
as much as you want to see her 
 phone rings 
 continues ringing 
aren t you going to answer it 
guess i ll have to 
he    baby  hey 
yes  it must get lonely in there
all by yourself 
i bet you d like playmate  wouldn t you 
yes  you would 
let me be your playmate 
yes  thank you  yes 
let s try something
more grown up today  ok 
you re a bright fella  anybody can see that 
you wanna try to stand up 
yeah  wanna stand up 
want to try  give me your hands 
give me your hands  that s my boy 
that s my boy 
up we go 
ok  hold on 
come on  let s try it  up 
that s right  that s right 
o0p3 
but that was good  yeah 
it was fun  wasn t it  yeah 
let s try it again 
let s try it 
you just trust me 
i won t let you fall  
let s go  up  good 
  that s right  hold onto me 
  mrs  gentry 
just what do you think you re doing 
just trying to test his balance
and coordination 
yeah  well you shouldn t be trying
anything with him  he s much too delicate 
and you had no business
leaving him alone 
phone rang 
and i thought it might be important 
nothing s that important 
i didn t mean any harm  mrs  wadsworth 
i just want to help baby
reach his full potential 
are you sure that s all you want 
mrs  gentry 
what more could there be 
 alba  baby s happyjust like he is 
he loves being a baby 
nobody s asking for your opinion 
young lady 
give me the bottle
and get back in the house 
let s you and i have a little talk 
woman to woman 
  do you have any children  mrs  gentry 
  no  unfortunately 
well  i ve raised three children 
and believe me  i ought to know
what is best for my own child 
oh  i m sure you do 
mrs  wadsworth 
if i could convince you that baby
is capable of growth and development 
you wouldn t stand in his way  would you 
of course not  what mother would 
well  then  i think you should consider
putting baby into a special clinic
for the retarded 
a clinic  you mean like a hospital 
oh  no  not like a hospital 
it s a day clinic 
more like a school  where baby could be
with other young people like himself 
it s really the best way 
maybe the only way 
well  i never thought about it 
but i don t think it would work 
why not 
a lot of reasons 
it d put a real hardship on the family 
besides  i don t drive a car 
but that s no problem 
i could take baby to the clinic for you 
you mean take him there by yourself 
i d be happy to  it s part of my job 
no 
nobody takes my baby anywhere
without me 
i only thought   
well  maybe you think too much 
when it comes to baby 
i do all the thinking 
i see 
besides  we   
we could never afford
anything like a    a clinic 
but you could  mrs  wadsworth 
for someone like yourself 
these places are cost free 
what about the cost to us
in heartache and disappointment
when it all comes to nothing 
but we still have to try 
just give your son a chance 
and i know he won t disappoint you 
  are you that sure of yourself 
  yes 
well  i m willing to keep an open mind 
show me  show me why you think
baby has a chance 
but i m no therapist 
well  i ll make allowances for that 
show me 
alright 
baby  baby 
  come on  that s a boy  come on 
   baby grizzles 
yeah  come on 
what do you do with the ball 
you remember the ball 
now  come on out 
come on out  that s a boy 
that s a good boy 
qkey flake   some on 
come an up here 
yeah  we re gonna play with the ball 
we re gonna play with the ball 
look at the ball 
i m gonna throw the ball 
see the ball   it s fun 
there it goes 
now  get the ball  baby 
go on  you remember 
you remember  it s fun 
it s fun  it s fun 
get the ball  get the ball 
that s the way 
get the ball and bring it back 
get the ball and bring it back  baby 
that s the way 
get the ball and bring it back  baby 
baby  bring the ball back 
bring it back  baby 
bring it back  baby 
you call that progress 
even a dog can do a trick like that 
that s my failure 
mrs  wadsworth  don t make him pay
for my inadequacy 
well  i m not making any promises 
but i will think about what you said 
you won t be sorry 
  bye 
  i ll call you 
mama 
damn you 
get inside 
 electric jolt  baby screams 
  baby doesn t walk 
   electric jolt 
and baby doesn t talk 
and baby doesn t stand 
baby doesn t walk 
   electric jolt  baby screams 
  and baby doesn t talk to strangers 
alba  you ve punished him enough 
if you use this thing on him  you ll cripple him 
  it s better than using a belt  germaine 
  i ain t used it in two months 
he has to be disciplined or else he ll
do things he shouldn t and hurt himself 
you ll end up killing him 
when he s naughty 
it s the best way to teach him obedience 
don t kill him 
you know mama doesn t want him to
stand up and he shouldn t trust strangers 
baby doesn t stand
and that s what keeps baby safe 
stop it  he s your brother  not an animal 
arch 
maybe that ll teach you some discipline 
now  just get him in the closet 
get him in the closet 
yes  mama 
 baby sobbing gently 
 sobs  mama 
 children chattering 
 children chattering 
 ann  i hope you had a chance
to look over baby s file 
 man  yes  i have 
 ann  ralph  what do you see 
i know you ll agree
with my recommendation 
what s your special interest in this case 
can you think of anything more horrible
than being buried alive  
well  that s what happened
to this client 
he s been imprisoned
by a kind of sick love 
there s a normal  full grown man  
trapped  with no way out 
there s something here i don t understand 
if he isn t seriously retarded 
then how do you account for the fact
that he can t walk or talk 
negative reinforcement 
some kind of consistent punishment
to discourage him from normal learning 
that s a pretty serious charge 
well  they re a pretty strange family  
especially the mother 
each child is by a different man 
and all of them abandoned her 
now  the last one she was married to 
baby s father 
and i think when he left 
she just never got over it 
so shes taking revenge
on the only male member of the family 
well  that might be a partial answer 
but there s probably more to it
of a pathological nature 
ann  if you re convinced
mrs  wadsworth is an unfit mother 
you should turn the case over
to the public guardian 
i thought of doing that 
but i m hoping i won t have to 
suppose it s necessary 
well  i know enough about them 
more than enough 
but to prove it with solid evidence 
no chance 
i just don t understand it 
they should have been here
over half an hour ago 
  maybe they misunderstood you 
  no 
i was very precise about the time
and the place 
  may i 
  of course 
 phone rings 
hello 
 ann   germaine  this is ann gentry 
i m here at the clinic with dr  sutton 
   is baby on the way over  
  we re not going there today

mama changed her mind 
she changed her mind 
germaine  i d like to speak
with your mother  please 
she doesn t want to speak to you 
 have you talked
to your supervisor today  
no  why 
maybe you should 
 phone cuts off 
without their cooperation 
there isn t much you can do 
we ll just see about that 
  mr  foley  extension 360  please 
  ann 
i think you should forget this case 
what about baby 
what s going to happen to him 
  ann   
  mr  foley  this is ann gentry 
germaine wadsworth suggested
that i call you 
 muffled voice 
what kind of complaint 
surely  you don t believe
all that garbage  
yes  but   
but   
but mr  foley 
can t we at least talk about this 
   i m telling you to drop it  
  alright  mr  foley 
ann  i m beginning to worry about you 
that damn woman

 door shuts 
 mrs  wadsworth  well  what the hell
brings you back here again 
i can understand your surprise 
mrs  wadsworth 
after going behind my back
and telling ridiculous lies 
you were expecting someone else  
you re damn right 
you re not our worker anymore 
i just wanted to face you one more time
to tell you that you re sick 
you re the one who needs help  not baby 
ok  you said it 
now  get off my property 
  she causing trouble again  mama 
  you keep quiet 
now you  get away from here 
or i ll call the oops
and have them take you away 
i m going to fight you  mrs  wadsworth 
with the only weapon i have   the law 
for the legal custody of baby 
now  you just go ahead and try  honey 
there s an agency
that works to protect people 
it s called the public guardian office 
and you will be hearing from them 
  they can t do anything to us 
  they can investigate everything 
mrs  wadsworth  do you think your
treatment of baby can stand up to that 
that s just so much horse shit 
you want him for yourself 
well  agency or no agency 
you ain t gonna get him 
cos baby belongs to us 
no  to me 
he belongs to himself  he s not
the sub human thing you ve made him 
and once i report what i know 
it s just a matter of time
before baby is taken away
from all of you 
you damn bitch 
i ll be seeing you  mrs  wadsworth  
in court 
judith  i m home

 phone rings 
hello 
 this is ann gentry 
my mother in law said that you called  
well  i just wanted to apologize
for all that happened today 
there s really no excuse
for the way we acted 
we re willing to cooperate with you 
if you just give us another chance 
ok  uh   
 let s forget about what happened 
and make a fresh start 
right  so there s no reason
to bring in the public guardian 
maybe not 
we ll have to see about that 
 suppose we    
meet tomorrow sometime at my office 
well  i have an idea 
baby s having a birthday party tomorrow 
come then 
well  i appreciate the invitation 
mrs  wadsworth 
 but a party usually
isn t the best time to    
well  that way  you can also see baby
in a real family situation 
it might give you some more ideas
on how to help him 
alright

 wadsworth family  
 i am in the process
of making baby into a grown man 
 as i have always suspected 
 his responses are those
of a sensitive and intelligent person 
 his progress  so far 
proves that beyond a doubt 
 in a short time  the baby you once knew
will no longer exist 
 even if circumstances beyond my control
force him to return    home   
    it will be too late
to reverse his transformation 
 your baby is lost to you forever  
good samaritan 
what a lie 
we ve got to get him back
before ifs loo late 
just tell us what you want  mama 
we ll do it 
first  we have to find her 
 germaine  that s her car
