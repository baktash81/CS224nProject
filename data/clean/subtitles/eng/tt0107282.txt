for a foolish sum
this bird boasted
the market vendor
was once a duck that
stretched its neck
in hopes
of becoming a goose
and now look
it is too beautiful to eat
then the woman and the swan
sailed across an ocean
many thousands of li wide
stretching their necks
toward america
on her journey
she cooed to the swan
in america i will have
a daughter just like me
but over there nobody will say
her worth is measured
by the loudness
of her husbands belch
over there nobody will
look down on her
because i will make her speak
only perfect american english
and over there she will always be
too full to swallow any sorrow
she will know my meaning
because i will give her this swan
a creature that became more
than what was hoped for
but when she arrived
in the new country
the immigration officials
pulled the swan away from her
leaving the woman
fluttering her arms
and with only one swan
feather for a memory
for a long time now
the woman had wanted
to give her daughter
the single swan feather
and tell her this feather
may look worthless
but it comes from afar
and carries with it
all my good intentions

ying ying take this
my mother died four months ago
i realized for the first time
they wanted me to take my mothers place
so i sat down on the east
where things begin
with my mothers best friends
my mother started the joy luck club
having met all these women in church
auntie an mei
auntie lindo
auntie ying ying
for 30 years
these women feasted
forgot past wrongs
laughed and played
lost and won
and told the best stories
each week
they hoped to be lucky
and that hope
was their only joy
their connection with each other
had more to do with hope
than joy or luck
you win like your mother
uh i only played once
with some jewish friends in college
hmph jewish mahjong
not the same thing
entirely different
now chinese mahjong
very tricky
you have to watch
what everybody throw out
and you keep all this
in your head
and if nobody play well
then the game is just like
jewish mahjong no strategy
you american girls
play chinese jewish
whats the difference
oh
they were worried
in me they see their own daughters
just as ignorant of all
the hopes and dreams
our mothers brought
to this country
hey hey hey hey hey
no talking in chinese
huh
how do i know youre not cheating
we would not cheat
you dont know but not we
ah
you dont know but we are your auntie
and we are very honest people
we will not cheat you
maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe
hey june why you not
take the piano home
you only one who play
when i was nine years old
my mothers version
of believing in me
was believing that
i could be anything
anything she wanted
the best piano prodigy
this side of china
i never practiced
lucky for me old mr chong
couldnt tell the difference
hed gone stonedeaf
over the years
me and beethoven
we both hear it in our head
okeydokey
now how many sharps
how many flats
what key are we in
z major
what good
z major
now for the recital
more feeling
more gusto
im a girl and by me
thats only great
i am proud that
my silhouette is curvy
when i was young
auntie lindo
was my mothers
best friend and archenemy
their weapons of choice
were comparing their children
mom was sick of hearing
auntie lindo brag
about her daughter waverly who
was chinatowns chess champion
that night mom figured
id redeem her
with my international piano debut
i ask my daughter
help me carry grocery
she think this too much ask
all day long she play chess
i dust off all her trophy
appreciate me no
you lucky you dont have
the same problem
my problem
worser than yours
if i tell june
time to wash dish
she hear nothing but music
its like you cant stop
this natural talent
being a girl
until that night
i didnt believe i was a prodigy
twerp
in fact i used to go out of my way
to prove my mother wrong
that i wasnt cut out
to be the best anything
i could only be me
it was incredible it was like my hands
were possessed by mozart
and everybody could see this
could hear this
i was a genius
i had been discovered
and then i heard it
maybe they didnt notice
bravo bravo
encore well done
here we come
walkin down the street
after the talent show fiasco
get the funniest looks from
i figured i never had
to play the piano again
everyone we meet
400 turn off tv
hey hey were the monkees
practice piano time
people say we monkey around
i couldnt believe what she
was saying like i was
but were too busy singin
supposed to go through the
same torture again forget it
to put anybody down
what i say 400
were just tryin to be friendly
come and watch us sing and play
im not going to play any more
why should i
were the young generation
what did you say
and weve got something to say
im not your slave
this isnt china
you cant make me
get up
no no i wont
no
no no i wont
you want me to be someone im not
ill never be the kind of daughter
that you want me to be
there be two kinds of daughter
obedient or follow own mind
only one kind of daughter
could live in this house
obedient kind
then i wish i wasnt your daughter
i wish you werent my mom
too late to change this
thats when i remembered
what we could never talk about
then i wish i were dead
like them the babies
that you killed in china
my mother had once told me
this strange story
what happened
to her in china
she said she was going to chungking
to meet the man who was her husband
that was the first time i ever heard
she was married before my father
she barely had time to grab
her babies twin girls
that was the first time
i heard she had other babies
i always try to picture
in my mind what really happened
but she would never explain
she would only say by the time
she reached chungking
she had lost everything
and i said
wait what do you mean everything
what happened
to those babies
there were so many things about
my mother i never understood
this is the only one
i never forgave
the babies
you know
two babies
the babies we all thought
that the babies had died
but last month at a church picnic
you know
two babies your mother leave
on the roadside in wartime
its miracle
but we find them
yes can you imagine
they still alive
what are you saying
theyre alive
i think your mother
always want to find them
her longcherished wish
so after she died
we tried for her
writing writing writing
my
this is from them those babies
ah no baby anymore
theyre alive
oh what does it say
what does it mean
it say
see here
they are very glad
no no no no no
overjoyed beyond belief
at last find you
their little sister
and they say
see here
how sad how very sad
too late to meet their mother
now she no longer in this world
yes yes
it says
see here
you must come to china
and meet them
and tell them
all about their mother
what could i tell them
i didnt know anything
about her she was
she was my mother
what do you mean
tell them how smart she was
your mother is your voice
how kind she was
everyone love her
how sincere how hardworking she was
and the excellent dishes she cooked
even better than mine
and how beautiful she sang
dont you remember
how can a daughter
not know her own mother
youre right
i will tell them
ii should
i want to
june june
what you thinking
oh those babies
of course the twins
i cant believe im actually
going to meet them
how sad they must have been
when you told them mom died
that must have been the hardest
letter for you to write
oh peanut bowl empty
oh oh ill get us some
all this time never
telling her the truth
must tell her today
how can you not tell her
how can i tell her what
the letter really say
then she never go to china
never go to see her sister
am i right
yes of course
lindo i still think its wrong
its so sad for those babies
how could suyuan
give them up
to lose a mother so young
to wonder why
even to this day i wonder
how my own mother
could give me up
that day
when i was only
four years old
i came upon a meeting
that would change
my life forever
come here quick
come here
huang tai tai
this is my daughter
come here lindo
come over here
come to mama
dont keep huang tai tai waiting
she looks like a brat
shes usually very obedient
shes just shy today
i didnt know it but that day
my mother made a promise
that when i became 1 5 i would
go live in this womans house
she looks so skinny
dont go by her looks
look at that lucky face
shell give you many grandsons
and fulfill the old matchmakers
guarantee to have many sons
with a husband
i had never met before
come here come here
have huang tai tai
take a closer look at you
stop stuffing yourself
no girl should eat so fast
for the next ten years
my mother treated me as if
i already belonged to huang tai tai
look at those dirty spots
who would want such a dirty
daughterinlaw
always be careful
otherwise when you go
to huang tai tais
she will disapprove of you
my mother did not say these things
because she didnt love me
she said these things
so she would not wish
for something
that was no longer hers
and then one day
my mother said our whole family
was moving to the south
everyone except me
remember
when you see huang tai tai
act happy
really you are very lucky
the marriage ceremony has begun
bride and groom
pay respect to each other
pay respect to the ancestors
be blessed with prosperity
be blessed with many sons
that night i would meet
my husband for the first time
the one who would
control my destiny
decide whether
i was happy or not
this one moment would decide
for my whole life
whether fear would rule
or i would
i decided
underneath i knew who i was
i promised myself
never to forget
i have prayed to the gods
many days for you
so that you were not too ugly
or too old
i must have prayed too hard
ha scared you to death
i am the husband
i make all the decisions
you sleep on the floor
do it do it now
the next few years
i tried to accept my life
to act like an obedient wife
every night i made
huang tai tai special soup
good for motherinlaws
still she was not pleased
where are my grandsons
my son says
you often refuse
to sleep with him
what kind of a wife are you
you sleep on your side
after that
i slept with my husband
every night
i slept with him
just like brother and sister
where are my grandsons
huh
my son says hes planted enough
seeds in you to fill a basket
plenty for
ten thousand grandsons
its all your fault
always running around
letting my sons seeds
spill out
from now on
you lie in bed all day
lie down
lie down
until my grandson comes
do you hear me
disgusting little thing
close all the windows
feel this
im pregnant
thats impossible
its yours
whatd i tell you
shes like this all the time
what the hells happening
whats wrong
tell me quick
its so scary
its too terrible to say
i had a bad dream
our ancestors came to me
so angry
they told me if tyanyu stays
in this marriage
he will die
whats this bullshit
what a stupid girl
to have bad dreams
the ancestors said
if the matter is
not settled immediately
they will begin
the cycle of destruction
there are three signs he said
first he has drawn a spot
on tyanyus back
and this spot will eat away
tyanyus flesh
just as it ate away
our ancestors face
the same mole i had seen
during all those nights
of sleeping just like
brother and sister
next our ancestor
touched my mouth
our ancestor said
if i dont leave this marriage
all my teeth will fall out
but how could i leave
this family i love so much
i live and die
for this family
the open spot in my mouth
where a rotted tooth
fell out four years ago
our ancestor also said
this girl here
is tyanyus
true spiritual wife
already growing his son
its true
to prove it our ancestor
planted the seed in her womb
already ripe in one day
ah ping
come over here
come over here
if you dont believe me
ask the matchmaker
i told them the matchmaker
had made the wrong match
on purpose
just for money
matchmaker how could you
how could you
well
mistakes happen in heaven
the hell with this
get out
all of you
huang tai tai
got her grandson
the servant girl

my promise to my mother

to act like you so important
go to fancy barber
with tornup jeans
darlene we need
a shampoo here
i mean i even married
a chinese guy to please her
he was gorgeous
he gave her a granddaughter
but was she satisfied
when we got divorced she got
all upset like it was my fault
i just want to show you
something its upstairs
watch out for shoshanas toys
and when i finally started dating again
when i tried to hint
to her about rich
that we were
living together
how could she not notice
this was not going to go away
even with her silent treatment
this is what
i wanted to show you
you know rich
the guy i told you about
i dont know why he got it for me
its really never cold enough to wear
you wanna try it
this not so good
only leftover strips
see fur too short
no long hairs
how can you
criticize a gift
he gave this to me
with all his heart
thats why i told you
not so good
i wasnt going to let her
get away with it this time
making me feel bad about rich
the love of my life
who treated me
like i was perfect
well arent you going
to say anything else
what i should say
about the apartment
about this
and this
or this
all of this
were here
where is everybody
the next week i brought rich to moms
birthday dinner sort of a surprise present
i figured she was going to have
to accept rich like it or not
oh rich this is my father
how ya doin
happy birthday mom
how are you
im good thank you
and ma this is rich
great to meet you
boy something smells wonderful
i guess we came to the right
place huh here you are
you know waverly has been telling me
that you are the best cook
i think maybe we got her
so many spots on his face
of course the night
was still young
thank god i already prepped
him on the emily post of chinese manners
hi uncle
how are you
actually there were a few things
i forgot to mention
uh let me make a toast
he shouldnt have had that second glass
heres to
when everyone else had
had only half an inch
everyone in the family
just for taste
shrimp my favorite
he should have taken only
a small spoonful of the best dish
until everyone had
had a helping
he has good appetite
he shouldnt have bragged
he was a fast learner
but the worst was when rich
criticized my mothers cooking
and he didnt even know
what he had done
as is the chinese
cooks custom
my mother always
insults her own cooking
but only with the dishes
she serves with special pride
this dish not salty enough
no flavor
its too bad to eat
but please
oh
that was our cue
to eat some
and proclaim it
the best shed ever made
you know lindo
all this needs is
a little soy sauce
oh uh oh
so howd your mom react when
you told her about the wedding
it never came up
how come
shed rather get
rectal cancer
oh
ma a soft wave for body
what do you think
look she doesnt
want it too short
otherwise itll be
too tight for the wedding
and we dont want it
looking too weird or kinky
isnt that right ma
not too kinky
why does my daughter think
shes translating english for me
maybe i dont go
what do you mean
maybe i dont go to your wedding
oh dont be ridiculous

future husbands family
i could see her face
looking at me
but not seeing me
she was ashamed
so ashamed
to be my daughter
ma

thinking about my mother
how much i wanted
to be like her
your mother
she told me
all the hopes
she had for me
words i would never forget
youre so lucky

youll have a better life
but listen carefully
to what is calling

after that everything
like this dream
our wedding
our son
honored guests
thank you for coming
i have persuaded
the famous diva miss bai yen
to sing in honor of my son
there he was
with his opera singer
this was not
his first conquest
only the first i permitted
myself to recognize
by then i knew what kind
of man i had married
happiest when he was cruel
let me have him
he became forgetful
dont touch it
so forgetful he had not
returned by the next morning
or the next evening
whos this
this person is a whore
just like you
my son
my son
listen to that voice
strong
like his father
look at you
disgusting
you make me sick
clean up this mess
you hear me
my whole life turned
in this moment
if i had left him
or killed him
i would not have lost
the one thing that mattered
my mind kept repeating
a single thought
he had taken from me
my innocence
my youth my heart
everything
so i took from him
the only thing i could
my baby was so light
in my arms
because his little spirit
had flown away
and with his
my spirit had also gone
years later
i moved to america
but what i had done in china
was always with me
in time i remarried
and i had a daughter
but lena had no spirit
because i had none
to give her
mommy
mommy
are you hungry yet
mom
mommy please answer me
mommy oh mom
as i was growing up
there were times when mom
went through these bad spells
she often seemed
scared and sad
but she would never
talk about it
except to say that she had been
married to a bad man in china
over the years
mom got better
although it seemed like all her fears
turned into worries about me
so now that im married
and shes visiting
our new house
i hope she can finally
be happy for me
dont worry
everythings fine
hes very nice to me
nice
nice very nice
oh mom mom
whats this
why dont you uh rest
in the living room
ill make you
some tea okay
ive got some
chrysanthemum tea
whats this writing
mom its nothing
you know its just
the things we share
at least thats what
harold calls it
sharing
everything 5050
so our love is always equal
the irony is i was the one
who started it that way
lets see
fortyone dollars
oh total
each what
you dont have enough
no its uh
its just uh i was
never very good at math
so what if i had a salad
and he had three courses
we were equals
except that i work in his firm
and he pays himself
seven times more
than he pays me
seven and a half
and then last year when we
finally decided to get married
we agreed love yes
false dependencies no
with most everything
we keep track of what we spend
then split it 5050
of course we agreed early on
not to include personal stuff
like my tampons and
feminine hygiene spray
and his shaving lotion
and foot powder
honey isnt there
a generic brand of cat food
i mean do they know the difference
for crying out loud 3476
but we still have these
philosophical arguments
about the gray areas
like magazines i subscribe to
which he reads
but only because theyre there
and the cat
even the goddamn cats fleas
you gave her to me
as a birthday gift
and now you want me to pay
to get rid of her fleas
ice cream you dont share
you dont eat ice cream
ever since that time you got sick on
strawberry and chocolate flavor together
i remember
now you must pay for half
of his ice cream
why do you do this
lena
hmm
lena when you buy charcoal
you have to buy lighter fluid
dont you know that yet do i
have to remind you every time
lena cannot eat ice cream
what
what are we talking about
its true ive hated
ice cream all my life
i dont touch the stuff
well i assumed you were always
trying to diet or something
oh yes shes lost so much weight
you cant see her anymore
hmm
one million dollars
and the walls are still crooked
its bad luck
harold wanted to keep it
that way for the effect
for effect a person has to lie here
thinking shes in a coffin
oh
careful its not too sturdy
harold made it back in college
why do you keep it
you put one more thing on top
and everything falls down
do you need anything else
no
okay
no nothing
competition
what is a drag race
what an idiot
regatta not drag race
i dont believe this guy
its cold
excuse me
i said would you close
the window please its cold
thats right for 1000
takes you to an even 6000
oh theres the bell
for final jeopardy
you have 30 seconds to come up
with the right question
honey move
whats goin on
i dont think you should get credit
for your ice cream anymore
fine you got it
end of discussion
why do you have to be
so goddamn fair
now at 10400 but youre
still not in the lead nancy
just what is this
about exactly
i dont know
maybe everything
the way we account for
everything what we share what
we dont share im sick of it
adding things up subtracting making it
come out even when its not im sick of it
youre the one
who wanted the cat
what are you talking about
all right
if you think im being unfair
well both pay for the fleas
this is not about fleas
that is not the point
then please tell me
what is the point
i i just think that we
need to change things
we need to think about
what this marriage is based on
not this balance sheet
well i know what
our marriage is based upon
and if you dont
then you better think about it
before you start
to change things
all around this house
i see the signs
my daughter looks
but she does not see
this is a house that
will break into pieces
mom
its not too late
all my pains my regrets
i will gather them together
my daughter will hear me calling
even though ive said no words
she will climb the stairs
to find me
mom
she will be scared
because at first
her eyes will see nothing
she will feel in her heart
mom
this place where she hides her fears
mom
she will know
i am waiting
like a tiger in the trees
now ready to leap out
and cut her spirit loose
mom
do you know what you want
i mean from him
respect
tenderness
then tell him now
and leave this lopsided house
do not come back
until he give you those things
with both hands open
i cant
losing him does not matter
it is you who will be found
and cherished
so my mom sees this mirror
at the foot of our bed
and she says aiya
a mirror there is bad luck
all the romance will hit the mirror
poom go back the opposite direction
so whatd you do
we moved it
yeah put that baby
right on the ceiling
waverly loves it
so ive heard
yeah well this guy

wheres jennifer
oh her auntie june
is putting her down for a nap
oh ill go check on her
oh yeah
and now the woman was old
and she had a daughter who
grew up speaking only
english and swallowing
more cocacola than sorrow
whats sorrow
sadness
for a long time now the woman
wanted to give her daughter
the single swan feather
and tell her
is the swan real
is there really a swan
i dont know baby
its my mamas story
and we cant ask her
cause shes dead
and the woman would
tell her daughter
this feather
may look worthless
but it comes from afar and carries with it
all my good intentions
whats intentions
oh a good intention means
everything your mommy wants for you
oh
like blowing out candles
on your birthday cake
like it
its great
its gonna be great for june
i bet the twins
are in china right now
dreaming about
their little american sister
yes but their motherh
thats who they waited for
all these years
they will be so sad
they already know
auntie lindo wrote them
as a little girl
i wondered every day
worst of all
i had to wonder in secret
i had no memory
of my mother
because she was
kicked out of the house
when i was four years old
an mei
you are not my daughter
if you have any selfrespect
you should kill yourself
your husband just died
and youve become
another mans concubine
an mei
the scar from the soup
was all i had left
of my mother
my grandmother my uncle
and my aunties
they taught me to hate her
they accused her of breaking
her vow as a widow
and running away
to marry a rich man
who already had a wife
two concubines and other children
then one day as my grandmother
was lying in her deathbed
if you have any dignity
leave right away
let your mother go to heaven
in peace
you are no longer
her daughter
i saw my own face
looking back at me
it was an old tradition
only the most
dutiful of daughters
would put her own flesh in a soup
ma
to save her mothers life
my mother did this
with her whole heart
even though my grandmother
had disowned her
this is how a daughter
honors her mother
ma
the pain of the flesh
is nothing
the pain you must forget
this is the most
important sacrifice
a daughter can make
for her mother
mama dont leave
mama dont leave
anmei mamas leaving
respect your uncle
and your aunties
remember be obedient
dont forget your mama
if you take this child away
she will become like you
never able to face anyone
never able to lift her head
i lost her once before
this time i took my chance
before it was too late
ma ma
you are going to ruin her whole life
mom mom
lets go
jennifer
give the soup to mommy
im afraid youll spill it
there you go
good girl
ted coming to dinner
why do you ask that
huh you bought flour egg
bittersweet hershey bar
skippy chunky
good for only chocolate
peanut butter pie who else eat
well iits not
a dinner exactly
just sort of a meeting
at the house tonight
meeting
yeah well we both thought it was time
to settle all the property stuff
both
yeah both absolutely
what you going to ask for
what are you talking about
talking about what youre worth
that first afternoon
he introduced himself on campus
he asked to borrow my notes
i pretended
i didnt know who he was
um this is so good
it is
people look at the newspaper
and they see the articles
i dont know why
im saying this
i knew who you were
when you came up to me
iive watched you for weeks
like all the girls watch you
and i was excited and flattered
when you came on to me
so i baked you this pie
and and we had dinner
only i dont know who you are
i know who your family is
and what they do
and suddenly im starting to wonder
whether i belong in this conversation
i dont like feeling that way
well
oh
i love you said that
i didnt say it to impress you
thats why it did
his dad owned
a publishing empire
his moms family had wineries
id never been around
people like this
dad mom
hi
this is rose hsu
my girlfriend
the one word sent me
into total shock
from which im afraid
ive never quite recovered
how do you do
hello hi
hello
is this a private reverie
or can an old lady join you
sure
you and ted havent known
each other long have you
actually no
ive never heard him speak
of you until this morning
but its always a thrill for a mother
to hear that sort of excitement
in her sons voice
so i hope you
wont misunderstand
what i have to say
i want you to know rose that
were a very liberal family
i couldnt believe what she was telling me
and we know several very
charming oriental people
it was straight out
of some awful racist movie
its just that ted
is going to be working
like the world of suzie wong
with his father in the company
and uh hes going to be
judged by people
of a different standard
publishers authors
critics and their wives
and they wont be
as understanding as we are
mrs jordan you sound as if
ted and i are getting married
thats hardly the case
oh i know dear its just that well
the way the world is
how unpopular vietnam was
im not vietnamese
im american
of course you are
its just
i understand you
thats all im trying to say
do you understand
mom
hello darling
were having a wonderful visit
hello darling
you know you know
i always knew you were a jerk
but shit this is the first time
in my life i am ashamed of you
how dare you
use that language
i think you better
apologize right now
im sorry mom you made
a fuckin asshole out of yourself
in front of the woman i love
were outta here
i wasnt sorry
what his mother did
how else would i have known
if he hadnt rescued me
how wonderful he was
that he loved me
in six months
we were married
after the wedding
the fears began to sink in
take hold
everything i had married into
the pressure the weight of it
i promised myself
that i could handle it
that nothing nothing
could ever change me
or us
wayne could you chop this up
into smaller slices
last time they were
way too big thanks
ah also could you dress
the deviled eggs
with tomatoes and watercress
at first it was just
a bunch of little things
loving things a wife would do behind
the scenes without him even knowing
you know like paying
the household bills
joe last time these
deviled eggs were too salty
buying him special gifts
that showed my love
thats still too salty
the beautiful part was
he never had to ask for any of this
in fact he never even knew
i told myself that was
the selfless way the loving way
instead of the chicken shit way
i was offered a fellowship in fine arts
hi
oh hi
to this school i admired in idaho
of course that was out of the question
how are you
the interesting part was
i never asked the question
not even of myself
sometimes i really dont
understand im serious
he leaves his wife
he was running two of
his familys magazines now
and there were four or five
business affairs each week
a 23yearold girl
i was glad to help
and knew he appreciated it
it just doesnt make any sense
i just dont understand
that at all i dont
i really dont i mean
if you can explain it to me
because
why does one cultivate their daughter
i mean they happen to
disagree with each other
and over time i could see
that ted was becoming bored
we said less and less
so i tried harder
i got pregnant for the worst reason
imaginable a last attempt to hang on
although of course i never thought of it
that way at the time
the good news was
he adored her
honey should we eat
in or out tonight
you decide
well uh
if we eat in
iive got lamb chops
or i could call ernies
or square one
whatever you want
really itll be great
okay i didnt mean
to interrupt your work
ill figure something out
youre not interrupting me
really i meant what i said
i want to hear what you want
cause i could defrost a chicken
if the lamb chops are too heavy
youve had a hard day
ii dont really care
i i just want you to
be happy
honey whats wrong
did i say something wrong
its just that
once in a while
i would like to hear
what you want
what do you mean
i mean id like to hear your voice
even if we disagree
you used to be different
different
you used to have an opinion
we used to argue
thats what you want
you want us to argue
i want you to be here
honey im here
im here for you you just have to
just tell me what you want
i told you
ill do the chicken
are you happy
of course i am
whats her name
is she beautiful
look i think that
we have to sell the house
but anything that you want any special
things that you need you let me know
need any cash you call barry and he
whats her fucking name
whats the difference
shes not the reason
what you going to do with leftovers
after he eat one slice
throw it away i guess
you ask yourself
why you make this
because i know
even if you dont
i like being tragic ma
i learned it from you
you think he sees this pie
now hes so sorry
take you for granted
you think this
you the foolish one
every time you give him gift
like begging
take this oh sorry
please forgive me
im not worth as much as you
so he only take you
more for granted
youre just like my mother
never know what youre worth
until too late
when i went to live
with my mother
i thought i had
become so happy
so important
then my new family returned
from the countryside
wu tsing his other wives
and children
now i wondered what my place
in this family would be
first wife
was a ghost of a woman
she blinded herself
to the faults of her daughters
third wife never gave
wu tsing a son
and lived in fear
shed be kicked out
but even she
outranked my mother
who was only fourth wife
the newest one
and finally second wife
the empress
of the household
with wu tsings only son
i watched how my mother
looked at this boy
and i wondered why
so youve come back already
this is the daughter
you wanted permission to bring
yes her name is anmei
put this on
second wife
this is too expensive
for a small child
she is not worthy of it
who is she to say who is worthy
a treasure like you
needs precious pearls
to light up your face
you may call me big mother
give them back
hurry now
if you dont thank big mother
you will make me
very angry
thank you big mother
anmei give me the necklace
i know you dont want to
but i will not have her buy you
for such a cheap price
my precious
pearl necklace
that had almost bought
my mind and heart
it was made out of glass
why should you believe me
i have become nothing
a fourth wife
a lowclass concubine
but anmei
i was not always like this
i was a first wife
your fathers only wife
never forget that
you are a daughter
of a first wife
you cant
my daughter is with me
then send her away
or let her watch
anmei
go to your nannys room
please
anmei why are you here alone
ive been looking for you
everywhere
is that his smell
why did you bring me here
nanny told me
she told me everything
you went to west lake temple
to make offerings
in memory of my father
wu tsing saw you there
second wife invited you over
to play mahjong
that night
wu tsing came to your room
i told her the rest so fast
as if it would hurt her less
ma
ma ma ma
no one believed
she was raped
not even her own mother
she had nothing
no one would take her in
no one would give her work
and she was carrying
wu tsings child
to save her baby
there was only one place
she could go
and when he was born
my little brother
second wife claimed him as her reward
give me back my son
an mei
i stayed alive
to keep my hope
of seeing you again one day
so its all true
an mei i brought you here
to give you a better life
but now
i know what i really have to do
mommy
mama mama
mama wake up
hurry wake up
mama
they were doing nothing
only waiting
for my mother to die
second wife told me
my mother had died by accident
taking too much opium
lies i know my mother
killed herself on purpose
mommy
she had eaten
sticky sweet dumplings
one after the other
filled with opium
when the poison
broke into her body
she whispered to me that she would
rather kill her own weak spirit
so she could give me
a stronger one
mama mama
mama
can you see
can you see
i am no longer scared
i am strong now
i see clearly now
whats true and whats false
my mother chose
the date of her death
to give me the power
over her enemies
my mothers ghost will return
in three days to settle scores
that day will be
the lunar new year
all debts must be paid by then
or horrible tragedies
will befall you
lord buddha forgive me
so on that day wu tsing
promised to revere my mother
as if she had been
first wife his only wife
he promised to raise me
and my mothers son
as his honored children
the highest position
and on that dayn
second wifes hair
began to turn white
mama
and on that day
i learned to shout
mom what does it mean
what does it mean mommy
i tell you the story
because i was raised
the chinese way
i was taught
to desire nothing
to swallow
other peoples misery
and to eat my own bitterness
and even though i taught
my daughter the opposite
but still she came out
the same way
maybe it is because she was born
to me and she was born a girl
and i was born to my mother
and i was born a girl
all of us like stairs
one step after another
going up going down
but always going the same way
but no this cannot be
this this not knowing
what youre worth
this not begin with you
my mother not know her worth
until too late
too late for her but not for me
now we will see
if not too late for you hmm
rose im
im standing out in the rain
ringing the bell for 1 5 minutes
are you okay
honey

for my daughters sake

good night daisy
thank you byebye
uhhuh okay goodbye
auntie lindo
i have something
i must tell you
one little thing
i forget tell you
you know i write letter
to your sisters
telling them how happy
you are to find them
how happy you are
you go to china to see them
yes auntie lindo
youve already told me this
and then i signed it
from your mother
what you signed the letter
in my mothers name
i try write different letter
telling them
so sad too late
mother gone dead
but how can i write
such letter no
this is my thinking
better hear from own sister
important news
you only one who can
you
you mean they think
that shes still alive
oh my god
my god
my god
you have to write back
tell them that shes dead
i cant tell them that
auntie lindo you have to write
another letter
too late
no way to do this
you leaving tonight
you must go you tell them
anyway this is best way
that my thinking
you know
ever since mommy died
its like a mystery
where everything is
she hides everything
jewelry even the fake stuff
for three years
she tried to tell me
where she hide everything
in case she die
i guess i wasnt listening
i i picked some things for them
you tell me if theyre okay
this one is from me
old photos of mom in china
i dont need old photos
for memory i have lots
you have lots
now they should have her
am i right
yeah
maybe when they see
picture of mom
so young so beautiful
they can still remember her
not like the way she look
when she left them
the way she looked
oh yes
very bad dysentery
back then
no medicine no doctors
she almost died you know
she never told you
oh
she thought
better not die
next to my babies
nobody saves babies
with such bad luck
who wants two babies
with ghost mother following them
very bad luck very
you know everything she had
she left with those babies
everything worth anything
she left a note
with all her gold
promising more if babies brought
to their father in chungking
ah so much bad luck
then she thought
even worser luck
someone save her
after she left them
put her in a truck
she woke up in the hospital
screaming wanting to die
come sit
one more thing
i found this
in mommys jewelry box
i know she was
saving it for you
someday she was going
to give to you i think now
go ahead open
its good luck for china
see
its a swan feather
swan feather
she decided
she couldnt give
that feather to you not yet
she didnt think
you would understand
well i guess i was never
very good at listening to her
no no no no
she thought
she wasnt worthy enough
mother to give it to you
worthy enough for me
because she gave up hope
about her other daughters
how can she show you
how to hope big
when she had lost hope
a mother mother can never give up
her hope for her own children
never
never
but she never did
on the day youre born
she transfer all her hope to you
all hope from those babies
she transferred
all her hopes to me
mine too
oh i love you daddy
i will tell them this feather
may look worthless
but it comes from afar
and carries with it
all my good intentions
hey hey hey hey
hey
yeah yeah yeah
mamas gone to heaven

four months ago
