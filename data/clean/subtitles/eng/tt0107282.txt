for a foolish sum 
 this bird   boasted
the market vendor   
 was once a duck that
stretched its neck   
in hopes
of becoming a goose 
and now look 
it is too beautiful to eat  
then the woman and the swan
sailed across an ocean   
many thousands of li wide   
stretching their necks
toward america 
on her journey
she cooed to the swan   
 in america i will have
a daughter just like me 
but over there  nobody will say
her worth is measured   
by the loudness
of her husband s belch 
over there  nobody will
look down on her   
because i will make her speak
only perfect american english 
and over there  she will always be
too full to swallow any sorrow 
she will know my meaning
because i will give her this swan   
a creature that became more
than what was hoped for  
but when she arrived
in the new country   
the immigration officials
pulled the swan away from her   
leaving the woman
fluttering her arms   
and with only one swan
feather for a memory 
for a long time now 
the woman had wanted   
to give her daughter
the single swan feather   
and tell her   this feather
may look worthless   
but it comes from afar
and carries with it   
all my good intentions

ying ying  take this 
 my mother died four months ago 
     9 99 
i realized for the first time 
they wanted me to take my mother s place 
so i sat down on the east 
where things begin   
with my mother s best friends 
my mother started the joy luck club 
having met all these women in church 
auntie an mei   
auntie lindo   
auntie ying ying 
for 30 years 
these women feasted   
forgot past wrongs 
laughed and played   
lost and won
and told the best stories 
each week
they hoped to be lucky   
and that hope
was their only joy 
their connection with each other
had more to do with hope   
than joy or luck 
  you win like your mother 
  uh  i only played once   
  with some jewish friends in college 
  hmph  jewish mah jong 
not the same thing 
entirely different 
now  chinese mah jong
very tricky 
you have to watch
what everybody throw out   
and you keep all this
in your head 
and if nobody play well   
then the game is just like
jewish mah jong  no strategy 
you american girls
play chinese  jewish 
what s the difference 
oh 
they were worried 
in me  they see their own daughters 
just as ignorant of all
the hopes and dreams   
our mothers brought
to this country 
hey  hey  hey  hey  hey 
no talking in chinese 
  huh 
  how do i know you re not cheating 
  we would not cheat 
  you don t know  but not we 
  ah 
you don t know  but we are your auntie 
and we are very honest people 
  we will not cheat you 
  maybe  maybe  maybe  maybe  maybe 
hey  june  why you not
take the piano home 
you only one who play 
when i was nine years old   
my mother s version
of believing in me   
was believing that
i could be anything   
anything she wanted 
the best piano prodigy
this side of china 
i never practiced 
lucky for me  old mr  chong
couldn t tell the difference 
he d gone stone deaf
over the years 
me and beethoven 
we both hear it in our head 
okey dokey 
now  how many sharps   
how many flats 
  what key are we in 
  z major 
  what  good 
  z major 
now  for the recital   
more feeling   
more gusto 
i m a girl and by me
that s only great
i am proud that
my silhouette is curvy
when i was young 
auntie lindo   
was my mother s
best friend and archenemy 
their weapons of choice
were comparing their children 
mom was sick of hearing
auntie lindo brag   
about her daughter waverly  who
was chinatown s chess champion 
that night mom figured
i d redeem her   
  with my international piano debut 
  i ask my daughter   
 help me carry grocery  
she think this too much ask 
all day long she play chess 
i dust off all her trophy 
appreciate me  no 
you lucky you don t have
the same problem 
my problem
worser than yours 
if i tell june
time to wash dish   
she hear nothing but music 
it s like you can t stop
this natural talent 
being a girl
until that night 
i didn t believe i was a prodigy 
twerp 
in fact  i used to go out of my way
to prove my mother wrong   
that i wasn t cut out
to be the best anything   
i could only be me 
it was incredible  it was like my hands
were possessed by mozart 
and everybody could see this 
could hear this 
i was a genius 
i had been discovered 
and then i heard it 
maybe they didn t notice 
bravo  bravo 
encore  well done 
here we come
walkin  down the street
  after the talent show fiasco   
  get the funniest looks from
  i figured i never had
to play the piano again 
  everyone we meet
  4 00  turn off tv 
  hey  hey  we re the monkees
  practice piano time 
  people say we monkey around
  i couldn t believe what she
was saying  like i was   
  but we re too busy singin 
  supposed to go through the
same torture again  forget it 
  to put anybody down
  what i say  4 00 
  we re just tryin  to be friendly
 come and watch us sing and play
 i m not going to play any more 
  why should i 
  we re the young generation
  what did you say 
  and we ve got something to say
i m not your slave 
this isn t china 
you can t make me 
  get up 
  no  no  i won t 
no 
no  no  i won t 
you want me to be someone i m not 
i ll never be the kind of daughter
that you want me to be 
there be two kinds of daughter 
obedient or follow own mind 
only one kind of daughter
could live in this house 
  obedient kind 
  then i wish i wasn t your daughter 
i wish you weren t my mom 
too late to change this 
that s when i remembered
what we could never talk about 
then i wish i were dead   
like them  the babies
that you killed in china 
my mother had once told me
this strange story   
what happened
to her in china 
she said she was going to chungking
to meet the man who was her husband 
that was the first time i ever heard
she was married before my father 
she barely had time to grab
her babies  twin girls 
that was the first time
i heard she had other babies 
i always try to picture
in my mind what really happened   
but she would never explain 
she would only say by the time
she reached chungking   
she had lost everything 
and i said 
 wait  what do you mean  everything  
what happened
to those babies  
there were so many things about
my mother i never understood 
this is the only one
i never forgave 
the babies 
you know 
two babies 
the babies  we all thought
that the babies had died 
  but last month at a church picnic  
  you know   
two babies your mother leave
on the roadside  in wartime 
it s miracle 
but we find them 
yes  can you imagine 
they still alive 
what are you saying 
they re alive 
i think your mother
always want to find them   
her long cherished wish 
so after she died 
we tried for her 
  writing  writing  writing 
   my   
  this is from them  those babies 
  ah  no baby anymore 
they re alive 
oh  what does it say 
what does it mean 
it say  
see here 
they are very glad  
no  no  no  no  no 
overjoyed beyond belief   
at last find you 
their little sister 
and they say  
see here 
how sad  how very sad   
too late to meet their mother   
now she no longer in this world 
yes  yes 
it says  
see here 
you must come to china
and meet them   
and tell them
all about their mother 
what could i tell them 
i didn t know anything
about her  she was  
  she was my mother 
  what do you mean 
tell them how smart she was   
  your mother is your voice 
  how kind she was 
  everyone love her 
  how sincere  how hard working she was 
  and the excellent dishes she cooked 
  even better than mine 
and how beautiful she sang 
don t you remember 
how can a daughter
not know her own mother 
you re right 
i will tell them 
i i should 
i want to 
june  june 
what you thinking 
oh  those babies 
of course  the twins 
i can t believe i m actually
going to meet them 
how sad they must have been
when you told them mom died 
that must have been the hardest
letter for you to write 
oh  peanut bowl empty 
oh  oh  i ll get us some 
all this time never
telling her the truth 
  must tell her today 
  how can you not tell her 
how can i tell her what
the letter really say 
then she never go to china 
never go to see her sister 
am i right 
yes  of course 
lindo  i still think it s wrong 
it s so sad for those babies 
how could suyuan
give them up 
to lose a mother so young   
to wonder why 
even to this day i wonder   
how my own mother
could give me up 
that day   
when i was only
four years old   
i came upon a meeting   
that would change
my life forever 
come here quick 
come here 
huang tai tai 
this is my daughter 
come here  lindo 
come over here 
come to mama 
don t keep huang tai tai waiting 
she looks like a brat 
she s usually very obedient 
she s just shy today 
i didn t know it  but that day
my mother made a promise 
  that when i became 1 5  i would
go live in this woman s house   
  she looks so skinny 
don t go by her looks 
look at that lucky face 
she ll give you many grandsons 
and fulfill the old matchmaker s
guarantee to have many sons   
  with a husband
i had never met before 
  come here  come here 
have huang tai tai
take a closer look at you 
stop stuffing yourself  
no girl should eat so fast 
for the next ten years   
my mother treated me as if
i already belonged to huang tai tai 
look at those dirty spots 
who would want such a dirty
daughter in law 
always be careful 
otherwise when you go
to huang tai tai s   
she will disapprove of you 
my mother did not say these things
because she didn t love me 
she said these things   
so she would not wish
for something   
that was no longer hers 
and then one day   
my mother said our whole family
was moving to the south 
everyone except me 
remember   
when you see huang tai tai   
act happy 
really  you are very lucky 
the marriage ceremony has begun 
bride and groom 
pay respect to each other 
pay respect to the ancestors 
be blessed with prosperity 
be blessed with many sons 
that night i would meet
my husband for the first time 
the one who would
control my destiny   
decide whether
i was happy or not 
this one moment would decide
for my whole life   
whether fear would rule   
or i would 
i decided
underneath i knew who i was 
i promised myself
never to forget 
i have prayed to the gods
many days for you   
so that you were not too ugly   
or too old 
i must have prayed too hard 
ha  scared you to death 
i am the husband 
i make all the decisions 
you sleep on the floor 
do it  do it now 
the next few years 
i tried to accept my life   
to act like an obedient wife 
every night i made
huang tai tai special soup   
good for mother in laws 
still  she was not pleased 
where are my grandsons 
my son says   
you often refuse   
to sleep with him 
what kind of a wife are you 
you sleep on your side 
after that 
i slept with my husband 
every night
i slept with him   
just like brother and sister 
where are my grandsons 
huh 
my son says he s planted enough
seeds in you to fill a basket 
plenty for
ten thousand grandsons 
it s all your fault 
always running around   
letting my son s seeds
spill out 
from now on   
you lie in bed all day 
lie down 
lie down 
until my grandson comes 
do you hear me 
disgusting little thing 
close all the windows 
feel this 
i m pregnant 
that s impossible 
it s yours 
what d i tell you 
she s like this all the time 
what the hell s happening 
what s wrong 
tell me quick 
it s so scary 
it s too terrible to say 
i had a bad dream 
our ancestors came to me 
so angry 
they told me if tyan yu stays   
in this marriage   
he will die 
what s this bullshit 
what a stupid girl
to have bad dreams 
the ancestors said   
if the matter is
not settled immediately   
they will begin   
the cycle of destruction 
there are three signs  he said 
first  he has drawn a spot
on tyan yu s back 
and this spot will eat away
tyan yu s flesh 
just as it ate away
our ancestor s face 
the same mole i had seen
during all those nights   
of sleeping just like
brother and sister 
next  our ancestor
touched my mouth 
our ancestor said   
if i don t leave this marriage   
all my teeth will fall out 
but how could i leave
this family i love so much 
i live and die
for this family 
the open spot in my mouth   
where a rotted tooth
fell out four years ago 
our ancestor also said
this girl here   
is tyan yu s
true spiritual wife   
already growing his son 
it s true 
to prove it our ancestor
planted the seed in her womb 
already ripe in one day 
ah ping 
come over here 
come over here 
if you don t believe me 
ask the matchmaker 
i told them the matchmaker
had made the wrong match   
on purpose 
just for money 
matchmaker  how could you 
how could you 
well   
mistakes happen in heaven 
the hell with this 
get out 
all of you 
huang tai tai
got her grandson 
the servant girl
got her marriage 
i got a rail ticket to shanghai

my promise to my mother 
but years later  things
were somewhat different

the perfect countermove 
as if she had been
the chess champion 
even at that age 
i knew i had an amazing gift 
this power 
this belief in myself   
to be better than anyone else 
if someone was bigger than me 
older than me  it didn t matter 
and if they were mean

what she said 
it was like a curse 
this power i had 
this belief in myself   
i could actually
feel it draining away 
i could feel myself
becoming so ordinary 
all the secrets i once saw   
i couldn t
see them anymore 
all i could see was  
were my mistakes 
my weaknesses 
the best part of me just   
  check 
  disappeared 
but i can t put it all
on my mother 
i did it to myself 
i never played chess again 
she needs a cut
and a perm  trevor 
and this color of hers  it s from that
cheap black dye she s been using at home 
god forbid she d pay to have
anything professionally done 
why i should pay 
what for 
why i should pay 90 dollar 
to act like you  so important 
go to fancy barber
with torn up jeans 
darlene  we need
a shampoo here 
i mean  i even married
a chinese guy to please her 
he was gorgeous 
he gave her a granddaughter 
but was she satisfied 
when we got divorced  she got
all upset like it was my fault 
i just want to show you
something  it s upstairs 
  watch out for shoshana s toys 
  and when i finally started dating again   
when i tried to hint
to her about rich   
that we were
living together  
how could she not notice 
this was not going to go away 
even with her silent treatment 
this is what
i wanted to show you 
you know rich 
the guy i told you about 
i don t know why he got it for me 
it s really never cold enough to wear 
you wanna try it 
this not so good 
only leftover strips 
see  fur too short 
no long hairs 
how can you
criticize a gift 
he gave this to me
with all his heart 
that s why i told you 
not so good 
i wasn t going to let her
get away with it this time   
making me feel bad about rich 
the love of my life   
who treated me
like i was perfect 
well  aren t you going
to say anything else 
what i should say 
about the apartment 
about this 
and this 
or this 
all of this 
we re here 
where is everybody 
the next week i brought rich to mom s
birthday dinner  sort of a surprise present 
i figured she was going to have
to accept rich  like it or not 
  oh  rich  this is my father 
  how ya doin  
  happy birthday  mom 
  how are you 
  i m good  thank you 
and  ma  this is rich 
great to meet you 
boy  something smells wonderful 
i guess we came to the right
place  huh  here you are 
you know  waverly has been telling me
that you are the best cook 
i think maybe we got her 
so many spots on his face 
of course  the night
was still young 
thank god i already prepped
him on the emily post of chinese manners 
hi  uncle 
how are you 
actually  there were a few things
i forgot to mention 
uh  let me make a toast 
  he shouldn t have had that second glass   
  here s to   
  when everyone else had
had only half an inch   
  everyone in the family 
just for taste 
shrimp  my favorite 
he should have taken only
a small spoonful of the best dish   
until everyone had
had a helping 
he has good appetite 
he shouldn t have bragged
he was a fast learner 
but the worst was when rich
criticized my mother s cooking   
and he didn t even know
what he had done 
as is the chinese
cook s custom   
my mother always
insults her own cooking   
but only with the dishes
she serves with special pride 
this dish not salty enough 
no flavor 
it s too bad to eat 
but please  
oh 
that was our cue
to eat some   
and proclaim it
the best she d ever made 
you know  lindo   
all this needs is
a little soy sauce 
oh  uh  oh 
so  how d your mom react when
you told her about the wedding 
it never came up 
how come 
she d rather get
rectal cancer 
oh 
ma  a soft wave for body 
what do you think 
look  she doesn t
want it too short 
otherwise it ll be
too tight for the wedding 
and we don t want it
looking too weird or kinky 
isn t that right  ma 
not too kinky 
why does my daughter think
she s translating english for me 
maybe i don t go 
  what do you mean 
  maybe i don t go to your wedding 
  oh  don t be ridiculous 
  maybe already ridiculous 
hair too ridiculous for
future husband s family 
i could see her face
looking at me   
but not seeing me 
she was ashamed   
so ashamed
to be my daughter 
ma 
  what s wrong 
  nothing 
nothing 
i   i only thinking   
thinking about my mother   
how much i wanted
to be like her 
your mother 
she told me   
all the hopes
she had for me   
words i would never forget 
you re so lucky 
you don t have ears like mine 
you ll have a better life 
but listen carefully
to what is calling 
can you feel in your heart   
what i am saying 
will you always keep it there 
you know   
after today   
i will never   
give you any more advice 
in my memory  my  
my mother very
important to me   
just like her words 
easy to appreciate memory 
ma 
why don t you like rich 
it s rich you afraid
i not like 
if i don t like your rich   
i act polite  say nothing 
let him have big cancer   
let my daughter be a widow 
i like rich 
of course i do   
to allow him to marry
such a daughter 
you don t know  
you don t know the power
you have over me 
one word from you 
one look   
and i m   
four years old again 
crying myself to sleep 
because nothing i do   
can ever  ever please you 
now  
now you make me happy 
look  look  look  look  ma  ma 
auntie ying  auntie ying 
  i did it 
  rich

after that  everything
like this dream 
our wedding   
our son 
honored guests 
thank you for coming 
i have persuaded
the famous diva  miss bai yen   
  to sing in honor of my son 
  there he was   
with his opera singer 
this was not
his first conquest   
only the first i permitted
myself to recognize 
by then i knew what kind
of man i had married 
happiest when he was cruel 
let me have him 
he became forgetful 
don t touch it 
so forgetful he had not
returned by the next morning 
or the next evening 
who s this 
this person is a whore 
just like you 
my son 
my son 
listen to that voice 
strong   
like his father 
look at you 
disgusting 
you make me sick 
clean up this mess 
you hear me 
my whole life turned
in this moment 
if i had left him
or killed him   
i would not have lost
the one thing that mattered 
my mind kept repeating
a single thought 
he had taken from me
my innocence   
my youth  my heart 
everything 
so i took from him
the only thing i could 
my baby was so light
in my arms   
because his little spirit
had flown away 
and with his 
my spirit had also gone 
years later 
i moved to america 
but what i had done in china
was always with me 
in time  i remarried   
and i had a daughter 
but lena had no spirit   
because i had none
to give her 
mommy 
mommy 
are you hungry yet 
mom 
mommy  please answer me 
mommy  oh  mom 
as i was growing up   
there were times when mom
went through these bad spells 
she often seemed
scared and sad 
but she would never
talk about it   
except to say that she had been
married to a bad man in china 
over the years
mom got better   
although it seemed like all her fears
turned into worries about me 
so now that i m married   
and she s visiting
our new house   
i hope she can finally
be happy for me 
don t worry 
everything s fine 
he s very nice to me 
nice 
nice  very nice 
  oh  mom  mom  
  what s this 
why don t you  uh  rest
in the living room 
i ll make you
some tea  okay 
i ve got some
chrysanthemum tea 
  what s this writing 
  mom  it s nothing 
you know  it s just
the things we share 
at least that s what
harold calls it 
sharing 
everything 50 50 
so our love is always equal 
  the irony is  i was the one
who started it that way 
  let s see  
  forty one dollars 
  oh  total 
each  what 
you don t have enough 
no  it s  uh   
it s just  uh  i was
never very good at math 
so what if i had a salad
and he had three courses 
we were equals 
except that i work in his firm
and he pays himself   
seven times more
than he pays me 
seven and a half 
and then last year  when we
finally decided to get married   
we agreed  love  yes 
false dependencies  no 
with most everything 
we keep track of what we spend   
then split it 50 50 
of course we agreed early on
not to include personal stuff   
like my tampons and
feminine hygiene spray   
and his shaving lotion
and foot powder 
honey  isn t there
a generic brand of cat food 
i mean  do they know the difference 
for crying out loud   34 76 
but we still have these
philosophical arguments   
about the gray areas 
like magazines i subscribe to 
which he reads   
but only because they re there 
and the cat 
even the goddamn cat s fleas 
you gave her to me
as a birthday gift 
and now you want me to pay
to get rid of her fleas 
ice cream you don t share 
you don t eat ice cream 
ever since that time you got sick on
strawberry and chocolate flavor together 
i remember 
now you must pay for half
of his ice cream 
why do you do this 
lena 
hmm 
lena  when you buy charcoal 
you have to buy lighter fluid 
don t you know that yet  do i
have to remind you every time 
lena cannot eat ice cream 
what 
what are we talking about 
it s true  i ve hated
ice cream all my life 
i don t touch the stuff 
well  i assumed you were always
trying to diet or something 
oh  yes  she s lost so much weight
you can t see her anymore 
hmm 
one million dollars 
and the walls are still crooked 
  it s bad luck 
  harold wanted to keep it
that way for the effect 
for effect  a person has to lie here
thinking she s in a coffin 
  oh 
  careful  it s not too sturdy 
harold made it back in college 
why do you keep it 
you put one more thing on top
and everything falls down 
do you need anything else 
  no 
  okay 
no  nothing 
   competition 
  what is a drag race 
  what an idiot 
regatta  not drag race 
i don t believe this guy 
it s cold 
excuse me 
i said  would you close
the window  please  it s cold 
that s right for 1 000 
takes you to an even 6 000 
oh  there s the bell
for  final jeopardy  
you have 30 seconds to come up
with the right question 
honey  move 
what s goin  on 
i don t think you should get credit
for your ice cream anymore 
fine  you got it 
end of discussion 
why do you have to be
so goddamn fair 
now at 10 400  but you re
still not in the lead  nancy  
just what is this
about exactly 
i don t know 
maybe everything 
the way we account for
everything  what we share  what
we don t share  i m sick of it 
adding things up  subtracting  making it
come out even when it s not  i m sick of it 
you re the one
who wanted the cat 
  what are you talking about 
  all right 
if you think i m being unfair 
we ll both pay for the fleas 
this is not about fleas 
that is not the point 
then  please  tell me 
what is the point 
i   i just think that we
need to change things 
we need to think about
what this marriage is based on   
  not this balance sheet 
  well  i know what
our marriage is based upon 
and if you don t 
then you better think about it   
before you start
to change things 
all around this house 
i see the signs 
my daughter looks 
but she does not see 
this is a house that
will break into pieces 
mom 
it s not too late 
all my pains  my regrets   
i will gather them together 
my daughter will hear me calling 
even though i ve said no words 
she will climb the stairs
to find me 
  mom 
  she will be scared   
because at first
her eyes will see nothing 
  she will feel in her heart   
  mom 
  this place where she hides her fears 
  mom 
she will know   
i am waiting
like a tiger in the trees   
now ready to leap out
and cut her spirit loose 
mom 
do you know what you want 
i mean  from him 
respect 
tenderness 
then tell him now 
and leave this lopsided house 
do not come back
until he give you those things 
with both hands open 
i can t  
losing him does not matter 
it is you who will be found    
and cherished 
so my mom sees this mirror
at the foot of our bed 
and she says   ai ya 
a mirror there is bad luck 
all the romance will hit the mirror 
poom  go back the opposite direction  
  so what d you do 
  we moved it 
yeah  put that baby
right on the ceiling 
  waverly loves it 
  so i ve heard 
yeah  well  this guy
will do anything for her 
  but they re allies  but now
it s getting out of hand   
  ah 
because after the party 
we re going to lake tahoe   
 and he actually asked her to come with us 
 okay 
  come on  she d have a great time 
  what are you  nuts 
well  choosing between the two of us 
i d rather i had the great time  okay 
  you ll have a good time 
  easy  cowboy 
  oh 
ah  ah  ah  save some
room for dessert 
my mom s cake is coming out  and i m
counting on you guys for two slices apiece 
  she ll eat five 
  ten 
uh  do i have to use chopsticks 
because it could take a while 
  where s jennifer 
  oh  her auntie june
is putting her down for a nap 
  oh  i ll go check on her 
  oh  yeah 
and now the woman was old 
and she had a daughter who
grew up speaking only   
english and swallowing
more coca cola than sorrow 
  what s  sorrow  
  sadness 
for a long time now  the woman
wanted to give her daughter   
the single swan feather
and tell her  
is the swan real 
is there really a swan 
i don t know  baby 
it s my mama s story  
and we can t ask her
 cause she s dead 
and the woman would
tell her daughter   
 this feather
may look worthless   
but it comes from afar and carries with it
all my good intentions  
  what s  intentions  
  oh  a good intention means   
  everything your mommy wants for you 
  oh 
like blowing out candles
on your birthday cake 
  like it 
  it s great 
it s gonna be great for june  
i bet the twins
are in china right now   
dreaming about
their little american sister 
yes  but their mother   h
that s who they waited for
all these years 
  they will be so sad 
  they already know 
auntie lindo wrote them 
as a little girl 
i wondered every day 
worst of all 
i had to wonder in secret 
i had no memory
of my mother   
because she was
kicked out of the house   
when i was four years old 
an mei 
you are not my daughter 
if you have any self respect   
you should kill yourself 
your husband just died   
and you ve become
another man s concubine 
  an mei 
  the scar from the soup   
was all i had left
of my mother 
my grandmother  my uncle
and my aunties   
they taught me to hate her 
they accused her of breaking
her vow as a widow   
and running away
to marry a rich man   
who already had a wife 
two concubines and other children 
then one day  as my grandmother
was lying in her deathbed   
if you have any dignity 
leave right away 
let your mother go to heaven
in peace 
you are no longer
her daughter 
i saw my own face
looking back at me 
it was an old tradition 
only the most
dutiful of daughters   
  would put her own flesh in a soup   
  ma 
to save her mother s life 
my mother did this
with her whole heart   
even though my grandmother
had disowned her 
  this is how a daughter
honors her mother 
  ma 
the pain of the flesh
is nothing 
the pain you must forget 
this is the most
important sacrifice   
a daughter can make
for her mother 
mama  don t leave 
mama  don t leave 
an mei  mama s leaving 
respect your uncle
and your aunties 
remember  be obedient 
don t forget your mama 
if you take this child away   
she will become like you 
never able to face anyone 
never able to lift her head 
i lost her once before 
this time i took my chance
before it was too late 
  ma  ma 
  you are going to ruin her whole life 
mom  mom 
let s go 
jennifer 
give the soup to mommy 
i m afraid you ll spill it 
there you go 
good girl 
ted coming to dinner 
why do you ask that 
huh  you bought flour  egg   
bittersweet hershey bar 
skippy chunky 
good for only chocolate
peanut butter pie  who else eat 
well  i it s not
a dinner exactly 
just sort of a meeting
at the house tonight 
  meeting 
  yeah  well  we both thought it was time   
to settle all the property stuff 
  both 
  yeah  both  absolutely 
what you going to ask for 
what are you talking about 
talking about what you re worth 
that first afternoon
he introduced himself on campus   
he asked to borrow my notes 
i pretended
i didn t know who he was 
um  this is so good 
it is 
people look at the newspaper 
and they see the articles  
i don t know why
i m saying this 
i knew who you were
when you came up to me 
i i ve watched you for weeks 
like all the girls watch you   
and i was excited and flattered
when you came on to me 
so i baked you this pie
and  and we had dinner 
only i don t know who you are 
i know who your family is
and what they do   
and suddenly i m starting to wonder
whether i belong in this conversation 
i don t like feeling that way 
well 
  oh 
  i love you said that 
i didn t say it to impress you 
that s why it did 
his dad owned
a publishing empire 
his mom s family had wineries 
i d never been around
people like this 
  dad  mom 
  hi 
this is rose hsu 
my girlfriend 
the one word sent me
into total shock   
  from which  i m afraid 
i ve never quite recovered 
  how do you do 
  hello  hi 
  hello 
is this a private reverie
or can an old lady join you 
sure 
you and ted haven t known
each other long  have you 
  actually  no 
  i ve never heard him speak
of you until this morning 
but it s always a thrill for a mother
to hear that sort of excitement   
in her son s voice 
so i hope you
won t misunderstand   
what i have to say 
i want you to know  rose  that
we re a very liberal family   
  i couldn t believe what she was telling me 
  and we know several very   
  charming oriental people 
  it was straight out
of some awful racist movie   
  it s just that ted
is going to be working   
  like the world of suzie wong 
with his father in the company 
and  uh  he s going to be   
judged by people
of a different standard 
publishers  authors 
critics and their wives 
and they won t be
as understanding as we are 
mrs  jordan  you sound as if
ted and i are getting married 
that s hardly the case 
oh  i know  dear  it s just that  well 
the way the world is 
how unpopular vietnam was 
i m not vietnamese 
i m american 
of course you are 
it s just  
i understand you 
that s all i m trying to say 
  do you understand 
  mom 
  hello  darling 
we re having a wonderful visit 
   hello  darling  
you know  you know 
i always knew you were a jerk 
but  shit  this is the first time
in my life i am ashamed of you 
how dare you
use that language 
i think you better
apologize right now 
i m sorry  mom  you made
a fuckin  asshole out of yourself   
in front of the woman i love 
we re outta here 
i wasn t sorry
what his mother did 
how else would i have known 
if he hadn t rescued me   
how wonderful he was 
that he loved me 
in six months 
we were married 
after the wedding 
the fears began to sink in   
take hold  
everything i had married into 
the pressure  the weight of it 
i promised myself
that i could handle it 
that nothing  nothing
could ever change me 
or us 
wayne  could you chop this up
into smaller slices 
last time they were
way too big  thanks 
ah  also  could you dress
the deviled eggs   
  with tomatoes and watercress  
  at first  it was just
a bunch of little things   
loving things a wife would do behind
the scenes without him even knowing 
  you know  like paying
the household bills   
 joe  last time these   
  deviled eggs were too salty 
  buying him special gifts
that showed my love 
that s still too salty 
the beautiful part was 
he never had to ask for any of this 
in fact  he never even knew 
i told myself that was
the selfless way  the loving way   
instead of the chicken shit way 
  i was offered a fellowship in fine arts   
  hi 
  oh  hi 
  to this school i admired in idaho 
  of course  that was out of the question 
  how are you 
the interesting part was 
i never asked the question   
not even of myself 
sometimes i really don t
understand  i m serious 
  he leaves his wife  
  he was running two of
his family s magazines now   
  and there were four or five
business affairs each week 
    a 23 year old girl 
 i was glad to help
and knew he appreciated it 
 it just doesn t make any sense 
i just don t understand
that at all  i don t  
i really don t  i mean 
if you can explain it to me 
  because  
  why does one cultivate their daughter 
i mean  they happen to
disagree with each other 
and  over time  i could see
that ted was becoming bored 
we said less and less 
so i tried harder 
i got pregnant for the worst reason
imaginable  a last attempt to hang on 
although  of course  i never thought of it
that way at the time 
the good news was 
he adored her 
honey  should we eat
in or out tonight 
  you decide 
  well  uh   
if we eat in 
i i ve got lamb chops 
or i could call ernie s
or square one 
whatever you want 
really  it ll be great 
okay  i didn t mean
to interrupt your work 
  i ll figure something out 
  you re not interrupting me 
really  i meant what i said 
i want to hear what you want 
 cause i could defrost a chicken
if the lamb chops are too heavy 
you ve had a hard day 
i i don t really care 
i   i just want you to   
be happy 
honey  what s wrong 
did i say something wrong 
it s just that
once in a while   
i would like to hear
what you want 
  what do you mean 
  i mean  i d like to hear your voice   
even if we disagree 
  you used to be different 
  different 
  you used to have an opinion 
we used to argue 
  that s what you want 
  you want us to argue 
  i want you to be here 
honey  i m here 
i m here for you  you just have to  
just tell me what you want 
i told you 
i ll do the chicken 
are you happy 
of course i am 
what s her name 
is she beautiful 
look  i think that
we have to sell the house   
but anything that you want  any special
things that you need  you let me know 
  need any cash  you call barry and he  
  what s her fucking name 
what s the difference 
she s not the reason 
what you going to do with leftovers
after he eat one slice 
throw it away  i guess 
you ask yourself
why you make this 
because i know 
even if you don t 
i like being tragic  ma 
i learned it from you 
you think he sees this pie   
now he s so sorry
take you for granted 
you think this 
you the foolish one 
every time you give him gift   
like begging 
 take this  oh  sorry 
please forgive me 
i m not worth as much as you  
so he only take you
more for granted 
you re just like my mother 
never know what you re worth 
until too late 
when i went to live
with my mother   
i thought i had
become so happy   
so important 
then my new family returned
from the countryside 
wu tsing  his other wives
and children 
now i wondered what my place
in this family would be 
first wife
was a ghost of a woman 
she blinded herself
to the faults of her daughters 
third wife never gave
wu tsing a son   
and lived in fear
she d be kicked out 
but even she
outranked my mother   
who was only fourth wife   
the newest one 
and finally  second wife   
the empress
of the household   
with wu tsing s only son 
i watched how my mother
looked at this boy 
and i wondered why 
so you ve come back already 
this is the daughter
you wanted permission to bring 
yes  her name is an mei 
put this on 
second wife 
this is too expensive   
for a small child 
she is not worthy of it 
who is she to say who is worthy 
a treasure like you   
needs precious pearls
to light up your face 
you may call me big mother 
give them back 
hurry now 
if you don t thank big mother   
you will make me
very angry 
thank you  big mother 
an mei  give me the necklace 
i know you don t want to 
but i will not have her buy you
for such a cheap price 
my precious
pearl necklace   
that had almost bought
my mind and heart   
  it was made out of glass 
  why should you believe me 
i have become nothing 
a fourth wife 
a low class concubine 
but an mei   
i was not always like this 
i was a first wife 
your father s only wife 
never forget that 
you are a daughter
of a first wife 
you can t 
my daughter is with me 
then send her away 
or let her watch 
an mei 
go to your nanny s room 
please 
an mei  why are you here alone 
i ve been looking for you
everywhere 
is that his smell 
why did you bring me here 
nanny told me 
she told me everything 
you went to west lake temple   
to make offerings
in memory of my father 
wu tsing saw you there 
second wife invited you over   
to play mah jong 
that night   
wu tsing came to your room   
i told her the rest so fast   
as if it would hurt her less 
ma 
ma  ma  ma 
no one believed
she was raped 
not even her own mother 
she had nothing 
no one would take her in 
no one would give her work 
and she was carrying
wu tsing s child 
to save her baby   
there was only one place
she could go 
and when he was born 
my little brother   
  second wife claimed him as her reward 
  give me back my son 
an mei 
i stayed alive   
to keep my hope
of seeing you again one day 
so it s all true 
an mei  i brought you here
to give you a better life 
but now   
i know what i really have to do 
mommy 
mama  mama 
mama  wake up 
hurry  wake up 
mama  
they were doing nothing   
only waiting
for my mother to die 
second wife told me
my mother had died by accident   
taking too much opium 
  lies  i know my mother
killed herself on purpose 
  mommy 
she had eaten
sticky sweet dumplings   
one after the other 
filled with opium 
when the poison
broke into her body   
she whispered to me that she would
rather kill her own weak spirit   
so she could give me
a stronger one  
mama  mama 
mama 
can you see 
can you see
i am no longer scared 
i am strong now 
i see clearly now   
what s true and what s false 
my mother chose
the date of her death   
to give me the power
over her enemies 
my mother s ghost will return
in three days to settle scores 
that day will be
the lunar new year 
all debts must be paid by then 
or horrible tragedies
will befall you 
lord buddha  forgive me 
so  on that day  wu tsing
promised to revere my mother   
as if she had been
first wife  his only wife 
he promised to raise me
and my mother s son   
as his honored children 
the highest position 
and on that day   n
second wife s hair
began to turn white 
mama 
and on that day 
i learned to shout 
mom  what does it mean 
what does it mean  mommy 
i tell you the story
because i was raised   
the chinese way 
i was taught
to desire nothing   
to swallow
other people s misery   
and to eat my own bitterness 
and even though i taught
my daughter the opposite   
but still she came out
the same way 
maybe it is because she was born
to me and she was born a girl 
and i was born to my mother 
and i was born a girl 
all of us like stairs   
one step after another 
going up  going down   
but always going the same way 
but  no  this cannot be 
this  this not knowing
what you re worth 
this not begin with you 
my mother not know her worth   
until too late 
too late for her  but not for me 
now we will see
if not too late for you  hmm 
rose  i m  
i m standing out in the rain   
ringing the bell for 1 5 minutes 
are you okay 
honey

honey  it s our house 
we agreed to sell it 
that s why i m here 
you re not taking my house 
you re not taking my daughter 
you re not taking
any part of me 
 cause you don t know
who i am  
i died 60 years ago  
i ate opium   
and i died   
for my daughter s sake 
now get out of my house 
  i m listening 
  it s not your fault  none of it 
i was the one
who told you that   
my love wasn t good enough   
that your love was
worth more than mine 
i was so full of shit 
  oh

  oh  it s auntie june s piece

how everybody s here 
yeah  your mom
would ve been so proud 
no meal s ever gonna be the same
without your mom s famous crab 
last chinese new year 
we had auntie lindo s family to dinner 
  it was the last time
my mom would ever cook   
  wow

  yeah  we can eat crab  mmm  yummy 
old chong 
everything all right 
how is everything 
oh  excellent  bravo 
best  best quality 
thank you 
you see 
best quality 
that s how my mother was 
everything had to be the best 
she believed the same about me 
that i could be anything 
instead   
i was the biggest disappointment
in my mother s life 
shoshana  stop playing
with your food 
say  didn t you play
the piano once 
  no  not really 
  yeah  i could ve sworn 
after all these years 
she was still so sneaky 
hey  june 
how your business go 
your mother tell me
you busy  busy  busy 
it s going pretty good 
although one of my clients
seems to think   
that freelance means free 
just because we re friends 
listen  june  i don t know
how to tell you this 
but that stuff you wrote  
well  the firm decided
it was unacceptable 
you re lying  you   you said  
you said it was terrific 
  i didn t want to hurt your feelings 
  you said that  
i was trying to see
if i could fix it somehow   
  but it just won t work 
  look  all copy needs fine tuning 
rewrites are free  of course 
i m just as concerned about
making it perfect as you are 
 june  i really don t think  
 just tell me what they
want to have changed 
i ll give you a call next week  okay 
we ll go over it line by line 
june  i can t 
it s just not   
well  sophisticated 
  i m sure what you do
for your other clients is wonderful 
  you girls 
ma 
and we are a big firm 
and we need somebody
who understands that 
  who understands our style 
  what does style have to do with it 
oh  god  i mean  really  june 
 three benefits  three needs 
three reasons to buy 
satisfaction guaranteed 
  for today s and tomorrow s tax needs  
  that s just part of it 
yeah  the bad part 
true 
cannot teach style 
june not like waverly 
must be born this way 
i was so humiliated 
outsmarted by waverly
and betrayed by my own mother 
i see you didn t
touch your crab 
like i said at dinner 
not hungry 
what 
still mad at waverly  
how could i be mad at someone
with all that style 
it s just a shame that
i wasn t born that way 
  so it s me you re mad at 
  no 
i m just sorry that
you got stuck with such a loser   
that i ve always been
so disappointing 
what you mean  disappoint 
  piano 
  everything 
my grades  my job  
not getting married 
  everything you expected of me 
  not expect anything 
never expect 
only hope  
only hoping best for you 
it s not wrong to hope 
no 
well  it hurts 
because every time you hoped
for something i couldn t deliver  it hurt 
it hurt me  mommy 
and no matter
what you hope for   
i ll never be more
than what i am 
and you never see that 
what i really am 
  uh huh

only you tried to take it 
everybody else

it s amazing  isn t it 
auntie lindo 
auntie ying ying   
auntie an mei   
long time friends
of my mother   
you are like
second mothers to me   
in so many ways 
truly 
i mean  you gave her back to me
by finding my sisters 
you ve given me something
i can still do for her 
here  i thought it was too late 
well  it isn t 
all right  well  good night  tc 
good night  daisy 
  thank you  bye bye 
  uh huh  okay  good bye 
auntie lindo 
i have something
i must tell you 
one little thing
i forget tell you 
you know i write letter
to your sisters   
telling them how happy
you are to find them   
how happy you are
you go to china to see them  
yes  auntie lindo 
you ve already told me this 
and then i signed it   
from your mother 
what  you signed the letter
in my mother s name 
i try write different letter
telling them   
 so sad  too late 
mother gone  dead  
but how can i write
such letter  no 
this is my thinking 
better hear from own sister 
important news 
  you  only one who can  
  you  
you mean  they think
that she s still alive 
oh  my god 
my god 
my god  
you have to write back 
tell them that she s dead 
i can t tell them that 
auntie lindo  you have to write
another letter 
too late 
no way to do this 
you leaving tonight 
you must go  you tell them 
anyway  this is best way 
that my thinking 
you know 
ever since mommy died   
it s like a mystery
where everything is 
she hides everything 
jewelry  even the fake stuff 
for three years
she tried to tell me   
where she hide everything
in case she die 
i guess i wasn t listening 
i  i picked some things for them 
you tell me if they re okay 
this one is from me 
old photos of mom in china 
i don t need old photos
for memory  i have lots 
you have lots 
now they should have her 
am i right 
yeah 
maybe when they see
picture of mom   
so young  so beautiful   
they can still remember her 
not like the way she look
when she left them 
the way she looked 
oh  yes 
very bad dysentery 
back then 
no medicine  no doctors 
she almost died  you know 
she never told you 
oh 
she thought   
 better not die
next to my babies 
nobody saves babies
with such bad luck 
who wants two babies
with ghost mother following them 
very bad luck  very  
you know  everything she had
she left with those babies 
everything worth anything 
she left a note
with all her gold   
promising more if babies brought
to their father in chungking 
ah  so much bad luck 
then  she thought 
even worser luck 
someone save her
after she left them 
put her in a truck 
she woke up in the hospital 
screaming  wanting to die 
come  sit 
one more thing 
i found this
in mommy s jewelry box 
i know she was
saving it for you 
someday she was going
to give to you  i think now 
go ahead  open 
it s good luck for china 
see 
it s a swan feather 
swan feather 
she decided   
she couldn t give
that feather to you  not yet 
she didn t think
you would understand 
well  i guess i was never
very good at listening to her 
no  no  no  no 
she thought   
she wasn t worthy enough
mother to give it to you 
worthy enough for me 
because she gave up hope
about her other daughters 
how can she show you
how to hope big   
when she had lost hope 
a mother  mother can never give up
her hope for her own children 
  never 
  never 
but she never did 
on the day you re born   
she transfer all her hope to you   
all hope from those babies 
she transferred
all her hopes to me 
mine too 
oh  i love you  daddy 
i will tell them this feather
may look worthless   
but it comes from afar   
and carries with it
all my good intentions 
hey  hey  hey  hey 
hey  
yeah  yeah  yeah 
mama s gone to heaven 
  gone  mama s dead 
  i m sorry 
when 
four months ago 
i m so sorry 
she loved you very much 
i m your sister  june  
our little sister 
i ve come to take
our mother s place 
i ve come to bring you
her hopes 
our sister 
our family 
it was enough   
for them and for me 
because really she was there
