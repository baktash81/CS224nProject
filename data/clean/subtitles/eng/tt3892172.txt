that makes him act strange
does he have weapons here
anything that might hurt somebody

okay
does he hide things
this is where we keep our
tools and important papers

thank you
are you just gonna
stand there
what are you doing
were making
um dream boards
you cut out pictures that
have to do with your future
so like houses or pets
or jobs stuff like that
something
to look forward to
like for example i want
love in my future so
its just something that we do every
week and it gives us a path
so what are you
doing here
i wasnt where i was supposed
to be so they took me away
well they dont think i was
where i was supposed to be
okay
where were you
with my dad in the park
so youre homeless then
no
why else would you be
living in the woods
if you had a home they
wouldnt have brought you here
they just dont understand
that it was my home
where is your dad
now
i think hes somewhere in this building
hes gonna come get me
tiffany know anyone whose
parents come for them
no
me neither
you want to make sure that
you fill in each bubble

the computer will grade this test
and the computer cant tell the
difference between bubbles and doodles
d
b
c
a
a
how do you read my answers you think
theyre gonna mean a certain thing
they might be able to tell us
a little bit more about you
you could just ask
yeah but you might not
be able to say it
we dont have any record of you going
to school who taught you how to read
my dad teaches me
youre actually quite a bit
ahead of where you need to be
but school is about social skills
too not just intellectual ones
can i see my dad now
respond truefalse
to each question
um its voiceactivated so you just
say it right into the microphone
theres 435 questions
if you cant answer something
you got three seconds
itll beep and move on
to the next statement
there you go
welcome
the test will begin in three seconds
i wake up rested and
peaceful most mornings
true
i enjoy reading
articles on crime
false
my daytoday life is full of
things that keep me interested
true
i have nightmares
or troubling dreams
i think about things that
are too bad to talk about
things arent turning out like
the prophets said they would
false
it seems like
no one understands me
false
do you feel safe living with your dad
yes
i saw that the two
of you share a tent
this ever made you feel uncomfortable
no
its warmer with two people at night
yeah
has anybody ever touched your body without your permission
no
we didnt need
to be rescued
your dad needs
to provide you shelter
and a place to live
he did he does
its not a crime
to be unhoused
many people are
but its illegal
to live on public land
is my dad
taking tests like this
i know theres
a lot of questions
and you wouldnt be the first one
to have a problem with this test
okay
but you can only abstain
from so many
i dont want it
to count against you
okay so true or false
im proud of my daughter
true
shes a really wonderful kid
you did a really great job
raising her
so lets answer
as many of these as we can
i am a strong team player
used to be
okay
i find it hard to imagine having a
long life and fulfilling my goals
in finding placement
for you and tom
weve considered
what kind of support
will be most helpful
for the both of you
wed like to go back
to the way we were living
we have found an option
its not the park
um its kind of a special accommodation
its pretty isolated
there would be no rules or regulations
saying you cant live here
because someone
is saying you can
traffic has already
begun to back up across the state
taking a look
at what the chopper sees
where is forest park
its directly behind us
this is mr walters

on my mind
they said
a person saw you

didnt think they saw me
it was a mistake
why didnt you
say something
i was afraid
i didnt want to leave our camp
it was such a good one

we stayed there too long
are we gonna be
okay here

the best of it
we could sleep out here

that one
right where the line of the
tree meets the leader

those are for the pain
when he does finally wake up
thank you
yep you bet

inside of a beehive
would you like me
to show you
okay wait right there
let me get something
for you
when i open this the bees are gonna come up
mmhmm
but theyre not
coming out to hurt you
when a bee stings it dies
so they dont wanna sting you
they wanna come up
and land on you
and just get to know you
its kind of nice to have the
trust of a whole box of creatures
that have the power to come out
and kill you if they wanted to
so it means a lot to me
that i have their trust
i worked hard to get it
mmm
come on
i nearly got it
lost it

like a seahorse
yeah
hows your dad doing
hes okay
trying to get up
on the crutches
yeah i didnt figure
hed stay down for long
he wants to leave
i imagine hes trying to find
a way to make it all right
and now he feels stuck
you know my friend here
boris has helped me a lot
i think your dad would like
having him around
he can sense
when somebodys restless
he can nudge him awake and help
him out of the dreams that way
thats what he does for me
i wonder if you wouldnt mind
taking him for a few days
hey
great
all right
good seeing you

thank you dear
dale this is all
ive got
me and dad
we want to stay
can you take it
youre welcome to stay down there
until your dad gets better
if you guys were gonna

water and propane things like that
is this enough
i dont need to take
your money right now
we want to stay
a long time
okay
i can take this
as a deposit
im not gonna rent the place
out from under you
thank you
