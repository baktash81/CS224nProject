  why d you chase us 
we need to figure out

  you needed a dog to figure that out 
  it s a big park 
i want you to tell me a
little bit about your dad 
does he drink
or take pills
or anything
that makes him act strange 
does he have weapons here 
anything that might hurt somebody 
no 
okay 
does he hide things 
this is where we keep our
tools and important papers 
one second 
thank you 
are you just gonna
stand there 
what are you doing 
we re making 
um  dream boards 
you cut out pictures that
have to do with your future 
so  like  houses or pets
or jobs  stuff like that 
something
to look forward to 
like  for example  i want
love in my future  so   
it s just something that we do every
week  and it gives us a path 
so  what are you
doing here 
i wasn t where i was supposed
to be  so they took me away 
well  they don t think i was
where i was supposed to be 
okay 
where were you 
with my dad in the park 
so you re homeless then 
no 
why else would you be
living in the woods 
if you had a home  they
wouldn t have brought you here 
they just don t understand
that it was my home 
where is your dad
now 
i think he s somewhere in this building 
he s gonna come get me 
tiffany  know anyone whose
parents come for them 
  no 
  me neither 
you want to make sure that
you fill in each bubble 
don t make any stray marks   cause
the computer will grade this test

difference between bubbles and doodles 
 d  
 b  
 c  
 a  
 a  
how do you read my answers  you think
they re gonna mean a certain thing 
they might be able to tell us
a little bit more about you 
you could just ask 
yeah  but you might not
be able to say it 
we don t have any record of you going
to school  who taught you how to read 
my dad teaches me 
you re actually quite a bit
ahead of where you need to be 
but school is about social skills
too  not just intellectual ones 
can i see my dad now 
respond true false
to each question 
um  it s voice activated  so you just
say it right into the microphone 
there s 435 questions 
if you can t answer something
you got three seconds 
it ll beep and move on
to the next statement 
there you go 
welcome 
the test will begin in three seconds 
i wake up rested and
peaceful most mornings 
true 
i enjoy reading
articles on crime 
false 
my day to day life is full of
things that keep me interested 
true 
i have nightmares
or troubling dreams 
i think about things that
are too bad to talk about 
things aren t turning out like
the prophets said they would 
false 
it seems like
no one understands me 
false 
  do you feel safe living with your dad 
  yes 
i saw that the two
of you share a tent 
  this ever made you feel uncomfortable 
  no 
  it s warmer with two people at night 
  yeah 
  has anybody ever touched your body without your permission 
  no 
we didn t need
to be rescued 
your dad needs
to provide you shelter
and a place to live 
he did  he does 
it s not a crime
to be unhoused 
many people are 
but it s illegal
to live on public land 
is my dad
taking tests like this 
i know there s
a lot of questions 
and you wouldn t be the first one
to have a problem with this test 
okay 
but you can only abstain
from so many 
i don t want it
to count against you 
okay  so true or false 
 i m proud of my daughter  
true 
she s a really wonderful kid 
you did a really great job
raising her 
so let s answer
as many of these as we can 
 i am a strong team player  
used to be 
okay 
 i find it hard to imagine having a
long life and fulfilling my goals  
in finding placement
for you and tom 
we ve considered
what kind of support
will be most helpful
for the both of you 
we d like to go back
to the way we were living 
we have found an option 
it s not the park 
um  it s kind of a special accommodation 
it s pretty isolated 
there would be no rules or regulations
saying you can t live here
because someone
is saying you can 
traffic has already
begun to back up across the state 
taking a look
at what the chopper sees   
where is forest park 
it s directly behind us 
this is mr  walters 
hi  tom 
welcome 
hey there

on some basic groceries 
and here s a casserole
for later 
when i read about you
in the paper   
we really can t thank you enough 
this is very generous of you

we could make this work 
a lot of people like to imagine they
could live the way you guys were living 
um   
okay

it was hard not knowing
how you were doing 
i was worried about you too 
everything s different now 
we can still think
our own thoughts 
come in 
here

there s something
on my mind 
they said
a person saw you 
and   
that s how
they found our camp 
i saw a person  but i
didn t think they saw me 
it was a mistake 
why didn t you
say something 
i was afraid 
i didn t want to leave our camp 
it was such a good one 
yeah 
we stayed there too long 
are we gonna be
okay here 
we re gonna make
the best of it 
we could sleep out here

interrupt your breakfast 
i was hoping you could help
out with the tree work 
you ever
drive a tractor 
you have any work
in the stables 
yeah  but  uh  i don t want
you down there just yet 
those are expensive animals
and take some training 
but right now
i need help with the trees 
that s where
i make my money

a half dozen more left 
we don t want to send something like
this to a customer in california 
they would not be
pleased with that 
it s got a big hole in it 
the top isn t over center 
it s a little wild  we only want
one top on a christmas tree 
no  right   
that one 
right where the line of the
tree meets the leader 
that s where
it needs to be cut

that s gonna frustrate him 
it s hard to tell if he may have lost some
function in his toes without an x ray

coming out to hurt you 
when a bee stings it dies 
so they don t wanna sting you 
they wanna come up
and land on you
and just get to know you 
it s kind of nice to have the
trust of a whole box of creatures
that have the power to come out
and kill you if they wanted to 
so it means a lot to me
that i have their trust 
  i worked hard to get it 
  mmm

yeah  i didn t figure
he d stay down for long 
he wants to leave 
i imagine he s trying to find
a way to make it all right 
and now he feels stuck 
you know  my friend here 
boris  has helped me a lot 
i think your dad would like
having him around 
he can sense
when somebody s restless 
he can nudge him awake and help
him out of the dreams that way 
that s what he does for me 
i wonder if you wouldn t mind
taking him for a few days 
hey 
great 
all right 
good seeing you 
okay  thank you 
thank you  dear 
dale  this is all
i ve got 
me and dad 
we want to stay 
can you take it 
you re welcome to stay down there
until your dad gets better 
if you guys were gonna
be here a long time 
it costs something to stay on for
water and propane  things like that 
is this enough 
i don t need to take
your money right now 
we want to stay
a long time 
okay 
i can take this
as a deposit 
i m not gonna rent the place
out from under you 
  thank you 
  will you grab that other bag 
dale  i really like
living here 
hmm 
i m looking for the carrots 
the dried carrots 
what s that for 
i leave this out for someone
who lives up in the woods 
haven t seen him
in years 
but i know
he gets the food
 cause when i come back 
the bag is always empty 
that s a good one  throw
some oranges in there too 
been the same spot
for years 
have you ever seen
inside a hive before 
it s cool  huh 
you put your hand
over it 
you can feel
the warmth of the hive 
a person can withstand
500 stings 
close your eyes 
open 
see  you don t need
to be scared 
i want to
tell you something 
please do 
i paid for this place 
so we can stay here 
yeah  that was
the right thing to do 
i rented this place 
so we can live here 
what are you doing 
dad  your    your leg isn t
even healed all the way 
and it won t 
it won t heal right 
i don t want to leave 
last time
you almost died 
and you would have
if i hadn t found you 
that will never
happen again

that different from us

to us  but we have to

with you isn t wrong with me
