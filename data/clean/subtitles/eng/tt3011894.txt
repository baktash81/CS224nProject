i see
my first boyfriend
was a classical musician
well thats what he studied
whats his name

he sent in some works
back when we were together
but they were never published
or printed
whats the right word
choose whatever term you like
and lll make it popular
pasternak gabriel pasternak
pasternak
lf id known it ld have told you
i was a gravedigger not a critic
he submitted his thesis
at the conservatory of music
when i was president of the jury
l ripped him apart
yes i was with him at the time
what you did to him was awful
he spent a week in bed
after reading the review
sometimes i have to destroy
some poor guys self esteem
to protect the ears
of an entire population
i may be wrong sometimes
but in this case
his work was
a dreadful monstrosity
are you still in touch with him
we didnt end on great terms
but lm still fond of him
he was a good guy
maybe but if you present
a piece like that to a jury
there has to be
something wrong with you
gabriel pasternak
how could l forget him
we laughed about it for months
lm sorry to interrupt
but i was listening to you
what a huge coincidence
gabriel pasternak
was my student
at palomar elementary school
i had to tell him
he was being held back
i can assure you
the kid had issues
lve never seen anything like it
in 30 years as a teacher
he was screaming
and crying like a newborn baby
miss leguizamón
lgnacio fontana

lgnacio fontana
unbelievable
theres a cosmic connection here
wasnt pasternak one of your classmates
are you friends with him
intimate friends
poor guy we were awful to him
this is beyond unbelievable

gabriel pasternak is
the cabin chief on this flight
we did our training together
we were friends
then he asked me out
and when l refused he started to get
never mind
after takeoff
he brought coffee to the cockpit
the door is locked
the pilots wont answer
im desperate
i dont know what to do
i cheated on him
with his only friend
with him
gabriel
gabriel are you there
its victor
victor jensen

who are you
l was his psychiatrist for years
then i raised my fees
he got mad and stopped seeing me
open the door gabriel

its not your fault
youre just a victim here
lm telling you plain and simple
it was your parents
who ruined your life
they asked too much of you
ever since you were born
they projected all their
disappointments on you

hi antonio how are you
hello dear
how are you
fine
we were just leaving
im the father
ill see you out
why not get a cab
and pick up the car later
you missed your daughters birthday
you make it sound so easy
lm tired of being robbed
the curb was not painted yellow
do you have any idea
how furious that makes me
do you have any idea
how furious it makes me
that you always have an excuse
that you blame society
for everything
today was the tow truck
yesterday was traffic
tomorrow itll be the rally
the truth is
you could have left earlier
you could have helped me set up
and have been here to welcome
your daughters friends
but everything else is a priority
except your family
and lm such a fool to think
one day youll change
but you know what
society wont change
you wont change
and lm tired
whats that supposed to mean
youre the engineer
do the math
the government allows a company
to rake in the big bucks from these fines
obviously
our elected officials get their cut
lts outrageous
but thats how it is
you have two options
pay and relax
or you give yourself
a heart attack
you know what
l have plenty to live for
i want to sail travel around the
world with my grandchildren
dont get so upset
right
take it easy
good morning
i got this ticket
i already paid the towing fee
but theres been a mistake
the curb wasnt painted yellow
may i
sure
lts 560 pesos
listen
lm a bit anxious about this
so please hear me out
the curb wasnt painted
i think you should send someone
to the address of the infraction
so you can check im right
then on behalf of the city government
you should apologize
because lm right
you should give me back
the towing fees
and compensate me for all the time
im wasting
according to the ticket
your car
was in a noparking zone
thats proof enough
the fine is 560 pesos
and you have to pay it either way
if you dont
interests will start accumulating
are you listening
proof enough my ass
lm telling you the curb
was not painted yellow
first dont insult me
lm doing my job
second you should know
how the law works
the fact that you dont know it
doesnt mean you can avoid
the consequences for breaking it
if you kill someone and say
i didnt know l couldnt do that
you go to jail
maybe no one told you that
but youll go to jail anyway
get the picture
that example is pretty inaccurate
im supposed to know by heart
where l am not allowed to park
whether the spaces are marked or not
exactly
that information
is available on the dmv website
i see
can you call your superior
there are none
really
what are you
the fucking president
sir theres a lot of people here
if youre not going to pay
please step aside
how does it feel to be a crook
tell me
security window 7
security
great
im submitting a complaint
exercising my rights as a citizen
that makes me a criminal
want to call security
call security go ahead
call them now do it
what are you doing
get off me
sign here please
hey buddy
how are you
they didnt rape you did they
this is unbelievable
this is really unbelievable
lts crazy
seijas sent the company lawyer
to take care of everything
finally some goodwill
because lately
maybe thats not the right word
your name is all over the news
along with the companys name
seijass partners arent too happy
the city government
is one of our biggest clients
theyre letting you go simón
lts been decided
youre currently unemployed
mr fischer
why is that a crime
i never said that
but it sounded like
thats what you were implying
lts not a crime
but it is a problem
when you have to provide
for your family every month
shes referring to child support
which includes clothing
tuition medical insurance
excuse me
lve supported my wife year round
ever since l met her
and my daughter will always have
what she needs
lf i have a problem
dont worry ill work it out
fortunately my client is now working
so we dont see why mr fischer
should have shared custody
excuse me
ive been paying for everything
for years
just because this month
shes employed and lm not
i dont have the right
to joint custody of our daughter
l hope the judge realizes
how unfair this situation is
what the judge will realize
is how violent you are
when you refer to your wife
what violence
im describing reality
where do you see violence
i see violence all over the place
mr fischer
i see violence on the streets
when l turn on the tv
and i see violence
in this newspaper article
im convinced that less contact
a child has with this kind of event
the better itll be for her wellbeing
victoria do you want to take
my daughter away from me
no i dont want to take
your daughter away from you
whats wrong
are you going crazy
my client and l are finished here
well see each other again in court
youre not going to say anything
are you working for her
get a therapist mr fischer
what
its from the heart
lll talk to you later
someones here
a kiss
hello
lm simón fischer
i spoke with mr ederers secretary
im supposed to leave my cv
sure lll give it to her
id rather give it to her personally
and if mr ederers here
ld like to have a word with him
i worked for over ten years
at seijas raffo martinez and associates
im not a rookie
the engineer is on a construction site
and his secretary
shes out for lunch
its 4 pm
i dont handle her schedule
you know what
l wont leave a damn thing
you can all go fuck yourselves
you ederer and his secretary
especially his secretary
go fuck yourselves
lunch at 4 pm
they must think im an idiot
the blue chevrolet
youre rude
this is a fascist regime
i have to pay first and complain later
exactly
you wont stop until a tragedy occurs
an act of terrorism
according to the official version
the defense claims it was an accident
the engineer worked with explosives
and the tow truck movement
caused the explosion
the prosecutor responds
the fact there were no victims
proves the engineer
meticulously calculated
the explosion range
this is the 4th time
my cars been towed
help me dynamite
please dynamite
blow up the tax office
lnsurance company refuses to pay
the tow truck companys responsible
for the damages
there are questions about the tow truck
companys concession
on social networks
thousands demand the release
of the engineer known as dynamite
thank you
happy birthday dynamite
dad
what happened
what happened santiago
say something
promise me he wont go to jail
well do everything we can
we reiterate right on libertador avenue
a driver struck a pregnant woman
and drove off
the driver did not stop
to help the victim
santiago tell me the truth
were you drinking
did you smoke pot
the eye witnesses couldnt identify
the car brand nor the license plate
as we speak the police is
analyzing security camera footage
in order to identify the vehicles owner
hit and run
another murderer behind the wheel
whos the car registered to
its in my name
and this is the registered address
yes
what have l done
what have you done
you ruined our life you asshole
help him mauricio please
get him out
santiago listen
l need to ask you some questions
look at me
was anyone else in the car
did you tell anyone what happened
no
lets take a look at the car
the windows are tinted
were they closed
l think so
try to remember
yes
did you get out of the car
to see what happened
or did you keep driving
l kept driving
where were you coming from
a bar downtown
did anyone see you arrive
or leave in the car
your friends a girl
i swear l cant remember
unfortunately
we have just been informed
that in the ambulance
heading to the hospital
both the woman
and her unborn child passed away
police is still gathering information
through footage from security cameras
and interrogating witnesses
thank you maam
youre welcome
lm really embarrassed to have
to make this proposition
but weve known each other for years
and i feel we have this kind of bond
besides
youre a father
l know you want the best for your kids
so i think this arrangement
may be good for you too
if you say you took the car for a drive
last night while we were sleeping
and that you were driving
at the time of the accident
lll hire the best lawyer
to get you the shortest sentence
possible
with good behavior
youll be out in a year and a half
is that right
thats right
good
and for doing me that huge favor
lll pay you 500000 dollars
you wouldnt earn that in a lifetime
and your family will be set for life
you know santiago
he wouldnt survive in prison
he couldnt stand it
josé
please sit in the car
grab the wheel with both hands
touch it everywhere
good
youd had some whiskey
your bosses were sleeping
as you parked the car like every night
you felt like going for a ride
if theyd asked youd have said
the tires needed air
then you bumped into something
and you cant remember anything
after that
until you woke up in here
josé
l cant thank you enough
dont touch him please
lts alright maam
excuse me
ive been thinking and
l dont know
id like to discuss it with my wife
she cant know about it

you end up with no deal
and youd go to prison for perjury
fine

and go to the country house
when you drive by a toll booth

mauricio pereyra

such an awful tragedy
an hour ago
my client heard noises downstairs
he thought someone had broken in
he went into the garage
and found the groundskeeper
sitting in his car drunk
in a state of shock
then he heard the news he put two
and two together and he called me
mauricio pereyra
this is the prosecutor on duty
and this is josé
hes worked for the family for what
1 5 years
now were going to speak
to the victims husband
the father of the unborn child

i went down libertador avenue
and i sped up
i was driving really fast
and l bumped into something
l couldnt tell what it was
lt was a blur
i thought it was a dog
l heard a loud thud
and l got scared
because l thought ld dented the car
l wanted to return and try to fix it
before mr mauricio woke up
may i
josé can you please sit
in the drivers seat
should i touch it
yes grab the wheel
sit back
could you shut the door
do you use the rear view mirrors
when you drive
the mirrors
yes of course l do
because in this position
you can only see the roof
lts a miracle
you only ran over one person
they must have moved
during the crash
all at the same time
yes
i think this car was driven
by someone much taller than you
does anyone else live in the house
my wife my son
my dog
no need to wake up the dog
but ld like to meet
your wife and son
sure no problem
well ask them to come down
do i have your permission
to start negotiating
ls it that bad
no everythings fine
hes willing to make a deal
but its going to be expensive
how expensive

dollars
he saw your house the way you live
he wont take less than that
the good news is
hell take care of everything
he knows the police chief
most of the judges
and hell help us reinforce the alibi
the groundskeepers
cant we leave him out
somebodys got to be responsible
two people are dead
it was all over the news
fine but l dont know
if i have that much cash
lts 1 5 million dollars
and theres my cut too

of course
im the one negotiating all this
l pay your firm a fortune every year
this is different
these are not fees
lm putting my name on the line
i was about to lend you my car
so your wife and son could make a getaway
youre not being fair
how much are we talking about
i dont know
half a million
look if youd like to call
another lawyer

my work ends here
go and close the deal
is everything okay josé
well not really
why not
for going to prison
im getting the same as your lawyer
l know im poor but
what youre doing is awful

then you go to prison
last night l watched a western
had a cup of tea
and went to bed early
what else do you want josé
be clear time is running out
the money we agreed on
and an apartment in mar de ajó
mauricio josé
can we all talk
justice justice
lets get to the point gentlemen
time is of the essence
theres no room
for misunderstandings
the story stays the same
lm going to need you
and your family to testify
so no one leaves town
youll leave the house in cuffs
with a hood on
outside therell be press
and angry people
theyll ask you questions
call you names dont say a word
we avoid controversy
let the trial move along
get a conviction and everyones happy
stop mom its my life
he wants to go out there and confess
lts the right thing to do
say something
he has no idea what hes doing
santiago calm down
your mom is right
well fix this
can you shut the door
and take care of santiago please
lets go
calm down santi
can we proceed
from now on youll be the middle man
l wont talk to mr pereyra again
until he testifies in court
and you josé avoid talking
to anyone except your lawyer
perfect
lll need some cash
for operational expenses
lets say 30000 dollars
lll need it first thing on monday
just one question
what do you mean
by operational expenses
there are officers outside
the police chief is there
if someone saw or heard anything
we need to cut them in
we have to avoid loose ends
so if youre ok
youll have the money on monday
but its coming out
of the budget we agreed on
i wont pay one more penny
mauricio please
yes please
thats what i say please
i know lm in a rough spot
but l wont be gutted like this
what the prosecutor
is saying is reasonable
lets not argue over 30000 dollars
you pay it then
take it out of your share
gentlemen theres no time for arguing
if you want to proceed
we have to do it now
then you pay it
youre getting 1 million dollars
and you want an extra
30000 for contingencies
whos getting a million
hes right
the million includes contingencies
your cut plus the 30000 add up
to a million dollars
dont touch my cut
you know what guys
lts over the deal is off
what do you mean its off
lts off
its over no one gets anything
no more
santiago
you said you wanted to confess
thats perfect
go out there and talk
l gave you the best education
and you always did
whatever you wanted
so now go screw yourself
calm down
can we be reasonable
what happened
theyre all vultures
thats what happened
but its over
l didnt kill anyone
the house of the alleged murderer
right here in san lsidro
this morning there was
an accident on libertador avenue
open the door
i have something important to tell you
can we talk in a civilized manner
what
its settled we have an agreement
the 30000 dollars will come
out of everyones share
l dont want to hear about it
lts over
get out of my house
let me remind you
two people are dead
lf santiago is found guilty
it will cost us much more
josé on the other hand is penniless
right so who will compensate
the victims family
the money should go to them
thats the right thing to do
that scumbag earns a salary
that comes out of my taxes
he should investigate what happened
you want to represent my son
discuss your fees with him
lf he can pay
its between you two
do what you have to do
do your job
we had a deal
its not honorable to back out
im sorry if l offended you
but ive always defended
your familys interests
i thank you with all my heart
youre an angel
can l talk to them
to see if l can improve the terms
excuse me
listen
i think we have
a better deal to offer you
josé takes the initial 500000
and says forget about
the apartment on the beach
the prosecutor and i
split the million
not one penny more
but we have to do it now
mauricio
the press is outside
and the prosecutor needs
to let the police chief
into the house
no
lll put up a total of one million
and you split it any way you want
what do you mean one million
take it or leave it
if you dont like it get lost
you come back here with
any other proposal
and lll press charges against
you for extortion
against you and the prosecutor
prosecutor can you reveal
the identity of the suspect
l cant give any details right now
but the case is virtually closed
theres only one suspect
and lm about to present
the brief to the judge
thank you
justice justice
watch out
always showing some skin bocha
and now
its time we all stand up
and give a big hand
to welcome our dear
