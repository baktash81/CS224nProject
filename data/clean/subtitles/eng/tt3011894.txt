about my hair 
l m a music critic

now you re trying to be nice 
classical music 
i see 
my first boyfriend
was a classical musician 
well  that s what he studied 
what s his name 
no  he s not famous 
he sent in some works
back when we were together 
but they were never published 
or printed 
what s the right word 
choose whatever term you like
and l ll make it popular 
pasternak  gabriel pasternak 
pasternak   
lf i d known it  l d have told you
i was a gravedigger  not a critic 
he submitted his thesis
at the conservatory of music
when i was president of the jury 
l ripped him apart 
yes  i was with him at the time 
what you did to him was awful 
he spent a week in bed
after reading the review 
sometimes i have to destroy
some poor guy s self  esteem
to protect the ears
of an entire population 
i may be wrong sometimes 
but in this case   
his work was   
a dreadful monstrosity 
are you still in touch with him 
we didn t end on great terms 
but l m still fond of him 
he was a good guy 
maybe  but if you present
a piece like that to a jury
there has to be
something wrong with you 
gabriel pasternak 
how could l forget him 
we laughed about it for months 
l m sorry to interrupt 
but i was listening to you 
what a huge coincidence 
gabriel pasternak
was my student
at palomar elementary school 
i had to tell him
he was being held back 
i can assure you 
the kid had issues 
l ve never seen anything like it
in 30 years as a teacher 
he was screaming
and crying like a newborn baby 
miss leguizamón 
lgnacio fontana 
remember me 
lgnacio fontana 
unbelievable 
there s a cosmic connection here 
wasn t pasternak one of your classmates 
  are you friends with him 
  intimate friends 
poor guy  we were awful to him 
this is beyond unbelievable 
i was a manager at home depot 
where this psycho you mentioned
worked for a while 
he always had trouble with customers 
so we had to let him go 
  and when i   
  excuse me 
does anyone else know gabriel pasternak 
  me 
  me too 
why 
why are you on this plane 
did you buy your tickets 
l m in real estate 
they sent it to me to check out a farm 
i have a meeting
with the tourism secretary 
they bought the ticket 
l won mine in a raffle 
i couldn t change the date 
l had to fly today 
gabriel pasternak is
the cabin chief on this flight 
we did our training together 
we were friends 
then he asked me out
and when l refused  he started to get   
never mind 
after takeoff 
he brought coffee to the cockpit 
the door is locked 
the pilots won t answer 
i m desperate 
i don t know what to do 
i cheated on him
with his only friend 
with him 
gabriel 
gabriel  are you there 
it s victor 
victor jensen 
talk to me  please 
  who are you 
  l was his psychiatrist for years 
then i raised my fees 
he got mad and stopped seeing me 
open the door  gabriel 
listen 
it s not your fault 
you re just a victim here 
l m telling you  plain and simple 
it was your parents
who ruined your life 
they asked too much of you
ever since you were born 
they projected all their
disappointments on you 
they are responsible
for your suffering 
gabriel  no one here   
has anything to do with it 
wlld tales

he auctioned our house 
because of him 
my father killed himself

be proud  kid 
for once in your miserable life 
you re doing something worthwhile 
  i m not doing anything 
  you re not 
you stay here arguing instead of
taking the food away from him 
relax 
you have nothing to worry about 
if there s an investigation 
i ll say l used rat poison in the kitchen
because we were infested 
which is true  by the way 
and some of it 
accidentally fell into a pot 
what will they say 
this is insane 
could this shit be expired 
there s no expiration date 
how does it work 
if rat poison is expired 
is it more or less harmful

l don t think so 
the towing fee is 490 pesos
and the parking ticket
will be sent to your address 
but l m trying to explain 
the curb wasn t painted yellow 
there was no way l could have known
it was a no parking zone 
i understand 
if you want to get your car back 
you have to pay the towing fee 
then you can file a complaint
monday to friday 
8 to 2 pm  at the dmv 
carlos pellegrini 211   1st floor 
let s do something else 
go and talk to whoever you need to 
l want to leave with my car

i m serious 
where is the office
where apologies are made 
we re all in the same boat 
please hurry up 
the parking ticket
indicates you committed an infraction 
we don t need further proof 
once again  if you want your car back 
you need to pay 
otherwise  please leave
so l can go on working 
lf i don t have cash 
we accept credit and debit cards 
or come back tomorrow 
but you ll be charged parking fee 
  you know you re a criminal 
  l m doing my job 
people who work for criminals
are criminals too 
right  that s your opinion 
just a miserable slave
to this corrupt system 
thank you  have a nice day 
almost there
don t bother 
almost everyone s gone
happy birthday  camila
happy birthday  precious 
can t we do it again 
forget about it  simón 
hello  baby  happy birthday 
here s the cake 
hello  kids 
hi  antonio  how are you 
hello  dear 
  how are you 
  fine 
we were just leaving 
i m the father 
i ll see you out 
why not get a cab
and pick up the car later 
you missed your daughter s birthday 
you make it sound so easy 
l m tired of being robbed 
the curb was not painted yellow 
do you have any idea
how furious that makes me 
do you have any idea
how furious it makes me
that you always have an excuse 
that you blame society
for everything 
today was the tow truck 
yesterday was traffic 
tomorrow it ll be the rally 
the truth is
you could have left earlier 
you could have helped me set up
and have been here to welcome
your daughter s friends 
but everything else is a priority
except your family 
and l m such a fool to think
one day you ll change 
but you know what 
society won t change 
you won t change 
and l m tired 
what s that supposed to mean 
you re the engineer 
do the math 
the government allows a company
to rake in the big bucks from these fines 
obviously 
our elected officials get their cut 
lt s outrageous 
but that s how it is 
you have two options 
pay and relax
or you give yourself
a heart attack 
you know what 
l have plenty to live for 
i want to sail  travel around the
world with my grandchildren   
  don t get so upset 
  right 
take it easy 
good morning 
i got this ticket 
i already paid the towing fee 
but there s been a mistake 
the curb wasn t painted yellow 
  may i 
  sure 
lt s 560 pesos 
listen 
l m a bit anxious about this 
so please  hear me out 
the curb wasn t painted 
i think you should send someone
to the address of the infraction
so you can check i m right 
then  on behalf of the city government 
you should apologize 
because l m right 
you should give me back
the towing fees
and compensate me for all the time
i m wasting 
according to the ticket 
your car
was in a no parking zone 
that s proof enough 
the fine is 560 pesos
and you have to pay it either way 
if you don t 
interests will start accumulating 
are you listening 
proof enough my ass 
l m telling you the curb
was not painted yellow 
first  don t insult me 
l m doing my job 
second  you should know
how the law works 
the fact that you don t know it
doesn t mean you can avoid
the consequences for breaking it 
if you kill someone and say 
  i didn t know l couldn t do that   
you go to jail 
maybe no one told you that 
but you ll go to jail anyway 
get the picture 
that example is pretty inaccurate 
i m supposed to know by heart
where l am not allowed to park 
whether the spaces are marked or not 
exactly 
that information
is available on the dmv website 
i see 
  can you call your superior 
  there are none 
really 
what are you 
the fucking president 
sir  there s a lot of people here 
if you re not going to pay 
please step aside 
how does it feel to be a crook 
tell me 
security  window 7 
security 
great 
i m submitting a complaint 
exercising my rights as a citizen 
that makes me a criminal 
want to call security 
call security  go ahead 
call them now  do it 
what are you doing 
get off me 
sign here  please 
  hey  buddy 
  how are you 
they didn t rape you  did they 
this is unbelievable 
this is really    unbelievable 
lt s crazy 
seijas sent the company lawyer
to take care of everything 
finally some goodwill 
because lately   
maybe that s not the right word   
your name is all over the news 
along with the company s name 
seijas s partners aren t too happy 
the city government
is one of our biggest clients 
they re letting you go  simón 
lt s been decided 
you re currently unemployed 
mr  fischer 
why  is that a crime 
i never said that 
but it sounded like
that s what you were implying 
lt s not a crime 
but it is a problem
when you have to provide
for your family every month 
she s referring to child support 
which includes clothing 
tuition  medical insurance 
excuse me 
l ve supported my wife year round
ever since l met her 
and my daughter will always have
what she needs 
lf i have a problem 
don t worry  i ll work it out 
fortunately my client is now working 
so we don t see why mr  fischer
should have shared custody 
excuse me 
i ve been paying for everything
for years 
just because this month
she s employed and l m not 
i don t have the right
to joint custody of our daughter 
l hope the judge realizes
how unfair this situation is 
what the judge will realize
is how violent you are
when you refer to your wife   
what violence 
i m describing reality 
where do you see violence 
i see violence all over the place 
mr  fischer 
i see violence on the streets 
when l turn on the tv 
and i see violence
in this newspaper article 
i m convinced that less contact
a child has with this kind of event 
the better it ll be for her well being 
victoria  do you want to take
my daughter away from me 
no  i don t want to take
your daughter away from you 
what s wrong 
are you going crazy 
my client and l are finished here 
we ll see each other again in court 
you re not going to say anything 
are you working for her 
  get a therapist  mr  fischer 
  what 
it s from the heart 
l ll talk to you later 
someone s here 
a kiss 
hello 
l m simón fischer 
i spoke with mr  ederer s secretary 
i m supposed to leave my cv 
sure  l ll give it to her 
i d rather give it to her personally 
and if mr  ederer s here 
l d like to have a word with him 
i worked for over ten years
at seijas raffo martinez and associates 
i m not a rookie 
the engineer is on a construction site 
and his secretary 
she s out for lunch 
it s 4 pm 
i don t handle her schedule 
you know what 
l won t leave a damn thing 
you can all go fuck yourselves 
you  ederer and his secretary 
especially his secretary 
go fuck yourselves 
lunch at 4 pm 
they must think i m an idiot 
the blue chevrolet 
you re rude 
this is a fascist regime 
i have to pay first and complain later 
exactly 
you won t stop until a tragedy occurs 
  an act of terrorism   
according to the official version 
the defense claims it was an accident 
  the engineer worked with explosives 
  and the tow truck movement
caused the explosion   
the prosecutor responds 
  the fact there were no victims
proves the engineer
  meticulously calculated
the explosion range   
this is the 4th time
my car s been towed 
help me dynamite 
please dynamite 
blow up the tax office 
lnsurance company refuses to pay 
  the tow truck company s responsible
for the damages   
there are questions about the tow truck
company s concession 
on social networks 
thousands demand the release
of the engineer known as   dynamite   
thank you 
happy birthday  dynamite   
dad 
what happened 
what happened  santiago 
say something 
promise me he won t go to jail 
we ll do everything we can 
we reiterate  right on libertador avenue 
a driver struck a pregnant woman
and drove off 
the driver did not stop
to help the victim   
santiago  tell me the truth 
were you drinking 
did you smoke pot 
the eye witnesses couldn t identify
the car brand nor the license plate 
as we speak  the police is
analyzing security camera footage
in order to identify the vehicle s owner 
hit and run 
another murderer behind the wheel   
who s the car registered to 
it s in my name 
  and this is the registered address 
  yes 
what have l done 
what have you done 
you ruined our life  you asshole 
help him  mauricio  please 
get him out 
santiago  listen 
l need to ask you some questions 
look at me 
was anyone else in the car 
did you tell anyone what happened 
no 
let s take a look at the car 
the windows are tinted 
were they closed 
l think so 
  try to remember 
  yes 
did you get out of the car
to see what happened
or did you keep driving 
l kept driving 
where were you coming from 
a bar downtown 
did anyone see you arrive
or leave in the car 
your friends  a girl 
i swear l can t remember 
unfortunately 
we have just been informed
that in the ambulance
heading to the hospital
both the woman
and her unborn child passed away 
police is still gathering information
through footage from security cameras
and interrogating witnesses   
  thank you  ma am 
  you re welcome 
l m really embarrassed to have
to make this proposition   
but we ve known each other for years
and i feel we have this kind of bond 
besides 
you re a father 
l know you want the best for your kids   
so i think this arrangement
may be good for you too 
if you say you took the car for a drive
last night while we were sleeping   
and that you were driving
at the time of the accident 
l ll hire the best lawyer
to get you the shortest sentence
possible   
with good behavior 
you ll be out in a year and a half 
  is that right 
  that s right 
good 
and for doing me that huge favor 
l ll pay you 500 000 dollars 
you wouldn t earn that in a lifetime 
and your family will be set for life 
you know santiago   
he wouldn t survive in prison 
he couldn t stand it 
josé   
please  sit in the car 
grab the wheel with both hands 
touch it everywhere 
good 
you d had some whiskey 
your bosses were sleeping 
as you parked the car  like every night 
you felt like going for a ride 
if they d asked  you d have said
the tires needed air 
then you bumped into something
and you can t remember anything
after that
until you woke up in here 
josé 
l can t thank you enough 
don t touch him  please 
lt s alright  ma am 
excuse me 
i ve been thinking and   
l don t know   
i d like to discuss it with my wife

and you d go to prison for perjury 
fine 
honey

  mauricio pereyra

l was about to call the police 
come in  please 
such an awful tragedy 
an hour ago 
my client heard noises downstairs 
he thought someone had broken in 
he went into the garage
and found the groundskeeper
sitting in his car  drunk 
in a state of shock 
then he heard the news  he put two
and two together and he called me 
mauricio pereyra 
this is the prosecutor on duty 
and this is josé 
he s worked for the family for what 
1 5 years 
now we re going to speak
to the victim s husband 
the father of the unborn child   
sir  what do you have to say

turn that off  it s not necessary 
i ve got one thing to say

l m going to   
very well  what happened  josé

josé

i ll be representing mr  torres
at my client s request 
he has never had any trouble
with the law and he s the father of two 
can you tell me about the accident 
l always park mr  mauricio s car 
l wanted to take the new one for a ride 
to take the beemer for a spin 
and last night   
l d been drinking 
and l went for it 
i never thought something
like this could happen 
i went down libertador avenue
and i sped up 
i was driving really fast 
and l bumped into something 
l couldn t tell what it was 
lt was a blur 
i thought it was a dog 
l heard a loud thud   
and l got scared
because l thought l d dented the car 
l wanted to return and try to fix it
before mr  mauricio woke up 
may i 
josé  can you please sit
in the driver s seat 
  should i touch it 
  yes  grab the wheel 
sit back 
could you shut the door 
do you use the rear view mirrors
when you drive 
the mirrors 
yes  of course l do 
because in this position 
you can only see the roof 
lt s a miracle
you only ran over one person 
they must have moved
during the crash 
all at the same time 
yes   
i think this car was driven
by someone much taller than you 
does anyone else live in the house 
my wife  my son   
my dog 
no need to wake up the dog 
but l d like to meet
your wife and son

we ll ask them to come down 
do i have your permission
to start negotiating 
ls it that bad 
no  everything s fine 
he s willing to make a deal 
but it s going to be expensive 
how expensive 
one million 
dollars 
he saw your house  the way you live 
he won t take less than that 
the good news is
he ll take care of everything 
he knows the police chief 
most of the judges
and he ll help us reinforce the alibi 
the groundskeeper s 
can t we leave him out 
somebody s got to be responsible 
two people are dead 
it was all over the news 
fine  but l don t know
if i have that much cash 
lt s 1  5 million dollars 
and there s my cut too 
your cut 
of course 
i m the one negotiating all this 
l pay your firm a fortune every year 
this is different 
these are not fees 
l m putting my name on the line 
i was about to lend you my car
so your wife and son could make a getaway 
you re not being fair 
how much are we talking about 
i don t know 
half a million 
look  if you d like to call
another lawyer 
that s fine by me 
my work ends here 
go and close the deal 
is everything okay  josé 
well  not really 
why not 
for going to prison 
i m getting the same as your lawyer 
l know i m poor  but   
  what you re doing is awful 
  awful 
then you go to prison 
last night l watched a western 
had a cup of tea
and went to bed early 
what else do you want  josé 
be clear  time is running out 
the money we agreed on   
and an apartment in mar de ajó 
mauricio  josé 
can we all talk 
justice  justice 
let s get to the point  gentlemen 
time is of the essence 
there s no room
for misunderstandings 
the story stays the same 
l m going to need you
and your family to testify 
so no one leaves town 
you ll leave the house in cuffs 
with a hood on 
outside there ll be press
and angry people 
they ll ask you questions 
call you names  don t say a word 
we avoid controversy 
let the trial move along 
get a conviction and everyone s happy 
stop  mom  it s my life 
he wants to go out there and confess   
lt s the right thing to do 
say something 
he has no idea what he s doing 
santiago  calm down   
your mom is right 
we ll fix this 
can you shut the door
and take care of santiago  please 
let s go 
calm down  santi 
can we proceed 
from now on  you ll be the middle man 
l won t talk to mr  pereyra again
until he testifies in court 
and you  josé  avoid talking
to anyone except your lawyer 
perfect 
l ll need some cash
for operational expenses 
let s say 30 000 dollars 
l ll need it first thing on monday 
just one question 
what do you mean
by operational expenses 
there are officers outside 
the police chief is there 
if someone saw or heard anything 
we need to cut them in 
we have to avoid loose ends 
so if you re ok   
you ll have the money on monday 
but it s coming out
of the budget we agreed on 
i won t pay one more penny 
  mauricio  please 
  yes  please   
that s what i say  please 
i know l m in a rough spot 
but l won t be gutted like this 
what the prosecutor
is saying is reasonable 
let s not argue over 30 000 dollars 
you pay it then 
take it out of your share 
gentlemen  there s no time for arguing 
if you want to proceed
we have to do it now 
then you pay it 
you re getting 1 million dollars
and you want an extra
30 000 for contingencies 
who s getting a million 
he s right 
the million includes contingencies 
your cut plus the 30 000 add up
to a million dollars 
don t touch my cut 
you know what  guys 
lt s over  the deal is off 
what do you mean it s off 
lt s off 
it s over  no one gets anything 
no more 
santiago 
you said you wanted to confess 
that s perfect 
go out there and talk 
l gave you the best education
and you always did
whatever you wanted 
so now  go screw yourself 
calm down 
can we be reasonable 
what happened 
they re all vultures 
that s what happened 
but it s over 
l didn t kill anyone 
   the house of the alleged murderer
right here in san lsidro 
this morning there was
an accident on libertador avenue   
open the door 
i have something important to tell you 
can we talk in a civilized manner 
what 
it s settled  we have an agreement 
the 30 000 dollars will come
out of everyone s share 
l don t want to hear about it 
lt s over 
get out of my house 
let me remind you
two people are dead 
lf santiago is found guilty 
it will cost us much more 
josé  on the other hand  is penniless 
right  so who will compensate
the victim s family 
the money should go to them 
that s the right thing to do 
that scumbag earns a salary
that comes out of my taxes 
he should investigate what happened 
you want to represent my son 
discuss your fees with him 
lf he can pay 
it s between you two 
do what you have to do 
do your job 
we had a deal 
it s not honorable to back out 
i m sorry if l offended you 
but i ve always defended
your family s interests 
i thank you with all my heart 
you re an angel 
can l talk to them
to see if l can improve the terms 
excuse me 
listen 
i think we have
a better deal to offer you 
josé takes the initial 500 000
and says forget about
the apartment on the beach 
the prosecutor and i
split the million 
not one penny more 
but we have to do it now 
mauricio 
the press is outside
and the prosecutor needs
to let the police chief
into the house 
no 
l ll put up a total of one million
and you split it any way you want 
  what do you mean  one million 
  take it or leave it 
if you don t like it  get lost 
you come back here with
any other proposal
and l ll press charges against
you for extortion 
against you and the prosecutor 
prosecutor  can you reveal
the identity of the suspect 
l can t give any details right now 
but the case is virtually closed 
there s only one suspect
and l m about to present
the brief to the judge 
thank you 
justice  justice 
watch out 
always showing some skin  bocha 
and now   
it s time we all stand up
and give a big hand
to welcome our dear   
romina and ariel 
let me hug my father in law 
take good care of her 
i ll be watching 
thank you 
l gave him a few good tips   
long live the newly weds 
everyone look this way 
a big smile
