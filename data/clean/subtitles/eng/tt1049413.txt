a lost world in south america 
lurking in the shadow of
majestic paradise falls

animals undiscovered by science

brought back this time 
gentlemen  i give you the
monster of paradise falls 
and gully  what a
swell monster this is 
but what s this

the national explorers society accuses
muntz of fabricating the skeleton

muntz of his membership 
humiliated  muntz vows to
return to paradise falls
and promises to capture
the beast    alive 
i promise to capture
the beast alive 
and i will not come
back until i do

off to clear his name

and good luck capturing the
monster of paradise falls

his fool s errand will
keep him most occupied   
most occupied  indeed
