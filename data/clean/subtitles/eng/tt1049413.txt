never before seen by civilized humanity
a lost world in south america
lurking in the shadow of
majestic paradise falls
its full of plants and
animals undiscovered by science
who would dare set foot on
this inhospitable summit
why our subject
today charles muntz

dirigible the spirit of adventure

his faithful dogs

for the canine comfort
its a veritable
flouting palace in the sky

to the locals hes considered
a business and hero and how
adventure is out there
but what has muntz
brought back this time

monster of paradise falls
and gully what a
swell monster this is

muntz of his membership
humiliated muntz vows to
return to paradise falls
and promises to capture
the beast alive

the beast alive
and i will not come
back until i do
