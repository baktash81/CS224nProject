i was just you said play something fast
did you read the music
that i wrote for you
yeah
do you know what polyrhythms are
yeah
i dont
these arent my drums
they belong to hunter
and he came up with the band name
i dont play the drums i play the drum
this drum in marching band for two years
i do it to get out of pe
but hunter says that doesnt matter
all it takes to be great
is commitment and sacrifice
which is what metals all about
or maybe its about power
or sticking it to the man
or denim or motorcycles or speed
or the devil
i dont totally understand it
but hunter says i dont have to
all i have to do is
play something heavy man
okay
like uh rock of ages
heavy
play something heavy
play something heavy
we need a bass player
mm
a bass player will be huge for us
yeah no doubt
no doubt
no doubt
stop stop
thats enough for today
emily can i talk to you for a second
the song youre playing
is not the song they are playing
im not sure youre even playing a march
weve talked about this

its an orchestra right
i know were in a marching band but
i see youre upset

fuck you
fuck your shitty band
fucking bullshit
too bad she cant play like she throws
i dont give a fuck so fuck you

cunt
you cant say that in america
that seems pretty metal to me
but im not sure
ill ask hunter about it
hes been into many things
since i met him
but hes stuck with metal
longer than any of them
when his mom left in seventh grade
he decided it was the key to everything
if we devote ourselves to metal
well own this school
watch it
everybody will see what we
really are and worship us like gods
im willing to give it a try
hunters been my best friend
ever since he stopped molly levine
from pulling out my hair in third grade
he always looks out for me
skip hoffman sucks pig dicks
i dont think he was trying to hit me
i was just in the way
clay moss

what im ready for
is your homecoming afterparty man
yep my parents are in geneva
so bring the whole school
if you want man seriously

asked your mom about the double bass kit
whatd she say
she said she doesnt have
a thousand dollars
okay well what about
a double bass pedal

but well have that attack
yeah she said
she doesnt have 150 either
shes in my speech class
i think shes english
scottish i dont know
i heard she went apeshit
on the band teacher
yeah
thats one messed up chick
the club isnt the best place
to find a lover
so the bar is where i go
ive never been to a party
i always wondered
what people like this did at them
people whose bands
didnt have names like skullfucker
now i know
here we are
in the middle of it all
and then we start to dance
and now im singing like
girl you know i want your love
your love was handmade
this rules
awesome idea
he said everybodys invited
boy lets not talk too much
how do they do it
what are you talking about
this is like three chords and they still
cant get it right they suck
look at the drummer
hes high out of his mind
i mean them all of them
how did they just do this
like its the easiest thing ever
okay listen to me
things are gonna happen for us
someday all these people
are gonna be like
holy shit
kevin schlieb and hunter sylvester

i couldve even hung out
with them maybe
but its gonna be too late

why dont they
i could give you a million reasons
my face is too narrow
i am talking to a girl
im not even afraid of her
beer is amazing
and im very pale
this party was a great idea
i dont care what hunter says

even he must be having fun right now

no no i
what did you call me
i didnt say anything to anybody i swear

me and my friend over here a real band
a serious band
not like you fucktards
got it um i guess well be seeing you
at the battle of the bands then
there hasnt been a battle of the bands
since dave migdall hung brain on stage
there is this year
go sign up with dean swanson
but maybe dont say fucktard
cause shes
a special olympics ambassador
all right guys
lets keep this party going
give me your car keys
come on
mm
hey
i was next
hunter i am busy
if youd like to wait
until i am done with the merinos
i demand you let us compete
in the battle of the bands
okay
not letting us play just because
were a postdeath metal band
would be a complete violation
of our first amendment rights
your first amendment rights
as a minor are unclear
but i agree it would be wrong
to exclude you
so why didnt
anybody tell us about it
i wasnt aware you had a death metal
postdeath
thank you frank
a postdeath metal band
youre welcome to participate
as long as your performance
is appropriate
i had to work on her but were in
awesome
so i guess we should start
looking for a bass player huh
yeah yeah definitely
this is huge for us
battle of the bands is where
it starts for people check it out
troy nix
jesus
guitarist and singer of kiloton
battle of the bands winners 1996
they were gods
no one in this school
liked heavy music same as now
but kiloton terrorized their way
straight to victory
by 1997
they were considered the greatest
unsigned metal band in the country
they could have been right up there
with metallica or pantera
but they broke up
i think drinking was involved
but you and me
thats not gonna happen to us
this is our moment
heavy music is gonna rise up
we win the battle of the bands
parlay that win into gigs
and then those gigs score us a deal
okay uh
what kind of deal
cocks okay
ive gotta get all the way to c hall
but um meet me after school
weve got work to do
hail satan
sup robbie
hop in
where are we going
youll take my life
but ill take yours too
it doesnt seem metal
to ask if hes got his dads permission
so i wont
but this
this definitely seems metal right
i mean i think it does
im not sure my mom and dad will
these drums
are gonna be huge for us
hes right
theyre huge
shut the fuck up
can i borrow the car
if you drop your brother off first
your father will pick him up
between shifts
im the best at crawl
and i can tread water the second longest
thats good earl
and i can do the best cannonball
everybody says
whats all this stuff
my drums
drums are dumb
yeah
i thought you were a clarinet player
no no
that was just so
i could do marching band instead of pe
i do that too
im kevin
emily
um
i saw you on the field
yeah that was my fault
i hadnt taken my meds for like
a week
i i take pepcid so
mm
do you like heavy metal at all
like rock of ages
uh no
more like
postdeath doom metal
i dont know what that is
and the slippers of spider climbing
go to malmsteen of gorgoroth
what kind of girlie name
is malmsteen of gorgoroth
i dont know dad why dont you ask
one of your real housewives
while youre shoving water balloons
into their tits
plastic surgeon
i understand dungeons  dragons
even less than metal
but its a chance for us
to hang out with new people
especially ones who play the bass
malmsteen
if he joins skullfucker
then were a band right
so we can play battle of the bands
if people like us
maybe theyll ask us to play some parties
i hope hunter likes this guy
sometimes hes not so nice to people
when hes uncomfortable
being around his dad makes him
well malmsteen just cant believe
that a halfling rogue
would be dumb and ungrateful enough
to try and rip off a halforc barbarian
who just saved him from five ice toads
but he thinks hell show mercy
until he remembers
that mercy is for the weak
malmsteen pulls out hell slinger
his 3 great sword
hunter
and he tells auriac stormhollow
to shut his glory hole
before he starts his first attack
plus ten thats a hit
hunter dont be an idiot
he runs the blade
between the thiefs ribs
second attack
uhoh
there goes the leg
and for the final attack
oh shit
head over to dr sylvesters
for some postop implants
because i just chopped off your dick
sure sure
you just remember that those implants
are what paid for your guitar
your incel action figures
and all your dumbass
satanworship tshirts
im gonna go play tennis
did you see my american express
where are you going
leaving
this sucks compared to call of duty
kevin see you in class
hunter we were going to ask him
to play bass for us
he says hes pretty good
its for the best
we can never trust a guy like that
im telling you
shes really good
we need a bass player
a metal bass player
she can be metal
thats the most ridiculous thing
ive ever heard
why why is that the most ridiculous thing
youve ever heard
because a celloplaying girl
is so nonmetal
that even thinking about it
is evaporating my balls
a lot of the time hunter
i dont know what youre talking about
metal not metal uh
maybe im just not right for skullfucker
okay switch places with me
what
just do it
slide over
open the door but dont get out
did you get her number
of course i got it
then what is it
i know i said id get her number
but i got her snapchat
snapchat is actually
no no no no no
no no no no
its fine
its the same thing
its not the same thing you know it
what
suck it cunt
ow
go go fuck
go fuck fuck
go go go go go
why why did you do that
truth to power bitch drive
why
faster than a bullet
terrifying scream
enraged and full of anger
hes half man and half machine
drive if he gets close enough
youre just as fucked as i am
you slow down you die thats metal
that is a dumb keanu reeves movie
planets devastated
oh shit
mankinds on its knees
watch out hell see you in the mirrors
if he gets close enough
what am i doing oh god
youre an asshole
evils going under deadly wheels
he is the painkiller
okay we can shake him
turn left on aspen
oh
dont slow down keep going straight
to where where
there
i we will not fit in there
i know this car
fucking do it
whoo
no no no
whoo
oh fuck
oh shit
whoa
fuck you fuck you
dude
i understand now
metal is commitment
and speaking truth to power
and sticking it to the man and speed
that was fucking awesome
metal is taking the wheel
whats this
homework
black sabbath
iron maiden
judas priest
metallica
anthrax
slayer
megadeth
motörhead
guns n roses
rage against the machine
pantera
emperor tool dio
meshuggah opeth slipknot
mastodon lamb of god
this is your history now
learn it live it
do lines of it in the bathroom
ill be working on this
its the solo to machinery
it fucking shreds
i had these made up
for luck
ill get to work on this then
cocks
fuck me okay
ah
fuck
generals gathered in their masses
just like witches at black masses
evil minds that plot destruction
sorcerer of deaths construction
in the fields the bodies burning
as the war machine keeps turning
death and hatred to mankind
poisoning their brainwashed minds
oh lord yeah
politicians hide themselves away
they only started the war
why should they go out to fight
they leave that role to the poor
yeah
hey um
hi
man shes amazing
maybe hunterll change his mind about her
when i tell him how much she shreds
enunciation and projection
these are two of the most important tools
in your communications toolbox
enunciation is the way we shape
the sounds that come out of our mouths
uh
dean swanson
wants to see hunter sylvester
i think that someone
is trying to kill me
infecting my blood
and destroying my mind
they only got
suspended two weeks
swanson wanted a month
but their assrapist coach intervened
yeah still theyre gone
they cant come back
to campus or anything
but when they come back
theyll totally assrape me
for getting them suspended
in the first place
getting them suspended its their fault
they defaced your hair
i flicked him in the chops first
okay well at clay mosss party
they pushed you into the speaker
in front of everybody
they started it
yeah i dont think
your average suburban nazi shitbag
is gonna see it that way
how is it
its cool yeah its cool yeah
yeah
yeah i kind of look like jason newsted
from metallica the bass player
hmm
oh right the one who got fired
its more viking than newsted
yeah like the school mascot
no no not like the school mascot
less like the school mascot
than anything on earth
more like a babys dick
than the school mascot
if a babys dick grew its own baby dick
then my hair would be more like
sorry im so late
glad you guys are still here
no no problem
no yeah not at all
uh yeah um so
um
what do you know
well how about you guys start playing
and ill work my way in
cool
um
how far have you gone in the the thing
yeah i i got through metallica
judas priest
im in the middle of slayer right now
and im having a little bit of trouble
okay okay lets try uh
lets try for whom the bell tolls
okay you got it kev
yeah okay
one two three four one two
yeah okay cool all right man
lets
that was cool
le um lets try playing the song
lets try playing the song
and we can see
how we vibe together as a band
and then well work on
all the stageshow elements later
right cool
two three four
i just
um im like kind of getting confused
cause i just dont know what else to do
dude you can play
or you can be wasted
but you cant play wasted
its not working out
we dont need a bass player
to beat those stooges
just keep it us two
okay like uh white stripes
weak no here check this out
its just two guys
it means that we wouldnt have to split
our contest winnings three ways
something to consider
thats mean
yeah it is
it doesnt feel
like a good time to tell hunter
that i dont wanna be in a band
that sounds like people being tortured
but i think its time for him to seriously
consider the only good option we have
no its a great option
it is time to speak truth to power
we have like two weeks
and she can learn everything in two days
its nothing personal emily
its just youre not consistent
with the image were trying to project
like i told kevin
is it because shes a girl
no
well what about joan jett
doesnt she rock
um the what about the runaways
thats joan jett
okay well theres lita ford
thats the runaways
and theres um
theres uh whats her um
kevin
uh what whats
whats the one with the song
kevin
kevin kevin kevin kevin
kevin we are a metal band
we are not an indie metal band
we are not an altmetal band
we are not a sort of metal band
we are a metal band
and for us to have a cello player
instead of a bass player
would be completely gay
uh
grinder
looking for meat
grinder
wants you to eat
youve gotta take all that in context
gay
gay our band is called skullfucker
skullfucker
you named it that to impress girls
were gonna die virgins
in a band called skullfucker
what i meant was were not
oh come on like she didnt know
hello
hey its kevin
oh
hey
uh hey i wanted to apologize
again for hunter being so rude and
that stuff he said he
its okay
im one too
hm
a virgin
i know its a shocker
oh um uh no
i was talking about that stuff
he said about girl cello players
in a metal band being gay
right sorry eh
first of all
thats a totally messed up thing to say
well maybe hes right
no hes not and youre not
not what
are we talking gayness
or heavy metal or virginity
uh um
all of them i think uh
they seem related
you are right
gay i dont think so
i guess theres sort of a spectrum
a virgin
oh um
yes definitely
hm
do you want to
to
do you want to not be
i uh
y yes
uh um uh do you
you know where temple solel is
on cleavy yeah
will you meet me
in the car park in a half hour
oh and can you bring thingies
for your thingy
hey mom uh
i need the car
okay
well your father should be back
from the shop around 800
and then we
mom i need the car
fucking
i know i know
we said 615
it is now 800
well something came up
what
what came up
nothing
i thought it was something
you said it was something
well i was wrong it was nothing
i can imagine something
being more important than a band practice
actually i cant
but i definitely cant see how nothing
could be more important kevin
well nothing
is more important
or nothing isnt more important
what i mean
i dont need abbott and costello
from you okay
i need a drummer a real drummer
metal is commitment kevin
its dedication sacrifice
mortification of the flesh
and all that shit
its serious
and if youre not gonna be
if youll be all girls with cello
showing up whenever i feel like it
then this isnt gonna work
and we wont win the battle of the bands
and then youre gonna be a loser
for the rest of your life
hey
hey
hey
oh hey
hi
where did you learn how to play
uh
i dont know
my friend just gave me these songs
and i practiced them
im not you know
a real drummer or anything
are you fucking high
that was intense
yeah
have you got a minute
are they all like this just pretty much
the same beat all the way through
yeah
pretty much
please kevin i promised my sister
and shes so psyched to have us play
but rays not getting out of rehab
for another month
and were tired of playing
with a wasted drummer
yeah man
fuck that dummy
i would like to
but its like i said
im in this band with hunter
and battle of the bands
is really important to him
lots of guys are in two bands
eric clapton was in like 60 bands
and i heard you play man
you could learn our songs in ten minutes
dont even worry
about the battle of the bands for now
just my sisters wedding
let me think about it
i feel you
but the weddings this weekend
so dont think too long
fuck
you blinked
i blunk
you blunk
three out of five
im pretty sure
youre better at staring than me
mmhmm
those your meds
mmhmm
my happy pills
dont you need more
mmmm
lay on top of me
not yet
lets just um
lie like this
i like it
makes me feel smooshed
on the field when i first saw you
yeah
did it feel good to
throw stuff and yell at people
no
feels good to not want to throw stuff
and yell at people
youre my happy pill
mm
its only a wedding
look youve got to understand something
kevin we dont fit in
you can try as hard as you want
you can get yourself a girlfriend
or whatever but you still wont fit in
she doesnt fit in either
why cant we all not fit in together
were not talking about that now
i dont even wanna go there
were talking about you being a traitor
maybe i wanna talk about it
im the founding member of skullfucker
and i say no yokos
you said fuck
we are both founding members
of skullfucker
dont
i am way more founding
i write songs buy equipment
designed our facebook page
oh fuck our facebook page
im the founding member of skullfucker
and i say no yokos
no more fuck
shut up
end of conversation
no you no you cant just declare
end of conversation
you dont have that authority
fine end of conversation
and that is how you knit a sweater
very good andrea
did you hear
how she enunciated and projected
get her all the way in the back right
and now hunter
death closes all
but something ere the end
some work of noble note
may yet be done
not unbecoming men that strove with gods
tennysons ulysses
you might know it from your english class
this speech is about metal
metal is about what ulysses was about
striving with gods
striking out for unknown territory
the people that crossed the bering strait
12000 years ago
metal
that kontiki guy
metal
the people on the mayflower
wouldve been metal
if it werent for all the jesus crap
and ulysses what did he do
huh
read dante hell tell you
ulysses got together
the baddest ass crew he could find
and then he sailed off
beyond the pillars of hercules
and then he was drowned
and pulled right down to hell
eighth circle
what is more metal than that
only the ninth circle
so achieving your dreams
with fellow badasses
going to hell if you have to
oh that sounds great right
but it wasnt so easy for ulysses
see he had um
he had penelope
mrs ulysses keeping him down
stay home
be king
go to work every day
he wasted decades of his life
on that shit
hunter
stop it
but one day ulysses decided
he was finished with his woman
hunter thats enough
it was inevitable
sooner or later the metal inside him
was bound to rise up
and crush
whatever stood in its path
fucker fucking cunt
youre fucking crazy
ill fucking i will fucking kill you
dont you ever come near me again
ow
not the guitar
that was inappropriate
bordering on inexcusable
i completely agree
im talking about you
wait what
is that what youve learned
from your interactions
with the vicious morons like skip hoffman
how to torment people weaker than you
look ive got
some personal issues with her
i could give a shit about
your personal issues with that poor girl
youre going to write down
exactly what you did
if miss johnson corroborates your account
ill include it in the disciplinary notice
ill send to your father
if she doesnt i will suspend you
your friends a massive dick
what the fuck
the fuck you doing
you are afraid of everybody
and instead of showing it like i do
you treat everybody like shit
and you make them hate you
great they leave you alone
they leave me alone
both of us are alone
mission accomplished
no no no
no shut up
you need me a lot more than i need you
without me
all of your dumb fantasies disappear
but without you
i might actually live a real life
you you cant
you cant
were skullfucker
fine fine go enjoy
your new fucking wacko girlfriend
and your new
and your new shitty band and

youre gonna tour with people
youre gonna spend all day every day
with them for years
