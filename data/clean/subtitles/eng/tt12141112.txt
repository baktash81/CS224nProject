i was just    you said play something fast 
did you read the music
that i wrote for you 
yeah 
do you know what polyrhythms are 
yeah 
i don t 
these aren t my drums 
they belong to hunter 
and he came up with the band name 
i don t play the drums  i play the drum 
this drum  in marching band for two years 
i do it to get out of pe 
but hunter says that doesn t matter 
all it takes to be great
is commitment and sacrifice 
which is what metal s all about 
or maybe it s about power 
or sticking it to the man 
or denim  or motorcycles  or speed 
or the devil 
i don t totally understand it 
but hunter says i don t have to 
all i have to do is   
  play something heavy  man 
  okay 
like  uh     rock of ages  
heavy 
play    something heavy 
play    something heavy 
we need a bass player 
  mm 
  a bass player will be huge for us 
  yeah  no doubt 
  no doubt 
no doubt 
stop  stop 
that s enough for today 
emily  can i talk to you for a second 
the song you re playing
is not the song they are playing 
i m not sure you re even playing a march 
we ve talked about this 
you have to listen and play 
it s an orchestra  right 
i know we re in a marching band  but   
i see you re upset 
fuck you 
fuck you 
fuck  i don t give a fuck
about what i m playing 
i don t give a fuck
about what they re playing 
fuck you 
fuck your shitty band 
fucking bullshit 
  too bad she can t play like she throws 
  i don t give a fuck  so fuck you 
fuck you 
cunt 
you can t say that in america 
that seems pretty metal to me 
but i m not sure 
i ll ask hunter about it 
he s been into many things
since i met him 
but he s stuck with metal
longer than any of them 
when his mom left in seventh grade 
he decided it was the key to everything 
if we devote ourselves to metal 
we ll own this school 
watch it 
everybody will see what we
really are and worship us like gods 
i m willing to give it a try 
hunter s been my best friend
ever since he stopped molly levine
from pulling out my hair in third grade 
he always looks out for me 
skip hoffman sucks pig dicks 
i don t think he was trying to hit me 
i was just in the way 
  clay moss 
  you ready for the game 
what i m ready for
is your homecoming after party  man 
yep  my parents are in geneva 
so bring the whole school
if you want  man  seriously 
  tell whoever  everybody s invited 
  all right 
  peace out  bro 
  catch you 
hey  man 
what s up 
asked your mom about the double bass kit 
what d she say 
she said she doesn t have
a thousand dollars 
okay  well  what about
a double bass pedal 
won t get the resonance 
but we ll have that attack 
yeah  she said
she doesn t have  150 either 
she s in my speech class 
i think she s english 
scottish  i don t know 
i heard she went apeshit
on the band teacher 
yeah 
that s one messed up chick 
  the club isn t the best place
to find a lover  
  so the bar is where i go  
i ve never been to a party 
i always wondered
what people like this did at them 
people whose bands
didn t have names like skullfucker 
now i know 
here we are   
in the middle of it all 
  and then we start to dance
and now i m singing like  
  girl  you know i want your love  
  your love was handmade     
this rules 
awesome idea 
he said everybody s invited 
  boy  let s not talk too much     
how do they do it 
what are you talking about 
this is like three chords and they still
can t get it right  they suck 
look at the drummer 
he s high out of his mind 
i mean  them  all of them 
how did they just    do this 
like it s the easiest thing ever 
okay  listen to me

someday  all these people
are gonna be like

i could give you a million reasons 
my face is too narrow   
i am talking to a girl 
i m not even afraid of her

a serious band 
not like you fucktards

at the battle of the bands then 
there hasn t been a battle of the bands
since dave migdall hung brain on stage 
there is this year 
go sign up with dean swanson 
but maybe don t say  fucktard  
 cause she s
a special olympics ambassador 
all right  guys 
let s keep this party going 
give me your car keys 
come on 
mm 
hey 
i was next 
hunter  i am busy 
if you d like to wait
until i am done with the merinos   
i demand you let us compete
in the battle of the bands 
okay 
not letting us play just because
we re a post death metal band
would be a complete violation
of our first amendment rights 
your first amendment rights
as a minor are unclear 
but i agree it would be wrong
to exclude you 
so why didn t
anybody tell us about it 
  i wasn t aware you had a death metal   
  post death 
thank you  frank 
a post death metal band 
you re welcome to participate 
as long as your performance
is appropriate 
i had to work on her  but we re in 
awesome 
so i guess we should start
looking for a bass player  huh 
yeah  yeah  definitely 
this is huge for us 
battle of the bands is where
it starts for people  check it out 
troy nix 
jesus 
guitarist and singer of kiloton 
battle of the bands winners 1996 
they were gods 
no one in this school
liked heavy music same as now 
but kiloton terrorized their way
straight to victory 
by 1997 
they were considered the greatest
unsigned metal band in the country 
they could have been right up there
with metallica or pantera 
but they broke up 
i think drinking was involved 
but you and me 
that s not gonna happen to us 
this is our moment 
heavy music is gonna rise up 
we win the battle of the bands 
parlay that win into gigs 
and then those gigs score us a deal 
okay  uh   
what kind of deal 
cocks  okay 
i ve gotta get all the way to c hall 
but  um  meet me after school 
we ve got work to do 
hail satan 
 sup  robbie 
  hop in 
  where are we going 
  you ll take my life
but i ll take yours too     
it doesn t seem metal
to ask if he s got his dad s permission 
so i won t 
but this   
this definitely seems metal  right 
i mean  i think it does 
i m not sure my mom and dad will 
these drums
are gonna be huge for us 
he s right 
they re huge 
shut the fuck up 
can i borrow the car 
if you drop your brother off first 
your father will pick him up
between shifts 
i m the best at crawl 
and i can tread water the second longest 
that s good  earl 
and i can do the best cannonball 
everybody says 
what s all this stuff 
my drums 
drums are dumb 
yeah 
i thought you were a clarinet player 
no  no 
that was just so
i could do marching band instead of pe 
i do that too 
i m kevin 
emily 
um   
i saw you on the field 
yeah  that was my fault 
i hadn t taken my meds for  like   
   a week 
i    i take pepcid  so   
mm 
do you like    heavy metal at all 
like rock of ages 
uh  no 
more like   
post death doom metal 
i don t know what that is 
and the slippers of spider climbing
go to malmsteen of gorgoroth 
what kind of girlie name
is malmsteen of gorgoroth 
i don t know  dad  why don t you ask
one of your real housewives
while you re shoving water balloons
into their tits 
plastic surgeon 
i understand dungeons   dragons
even less than metal 
but it s a chance for us
to hang out with new people 
especially ones who play the bass 
malmsteen   
if he joins skullfucker 
then we re a band  right 
so we can play battle of the bands 
if people like us 
maybe they ll ask us to play some parties 
i hope hunter likes this guy 
sometimes he s not so nice to people
when he s uncomfortable 
being around his dad makes him   
well  malmsteen just can t believe
that a halfling rogue
would be dumb and ungrateful enough
to try and rip off a half orc barbarian
who just saved him from five ice toads 
but he thinks he ll show mercy 
until he remembers
that mercy is for the weak 
malmsteen pulls out hell slinger 
his  3 great sword   
hunter 
   and he tells auriac stormhollow
to shut his glory hole
before he starts his first attack 
  plus ten  that s a hit 
  hunter  don t be an idiot 
he runs the blade
between the thief s ribs 
second attack 
uh oh 
there goes the leg 
and for the final attack   
oh  shit 
head over to dr  sylvester s
for some post op implants 
because i just chopped off your dick 
sure  sure 
you just remember that those implants
are what paid for your guitar 
your incel action figures 
and all your dumbass
satan worship t shirts 
i m gonna go play tennis 
did you see my american express 
where are you going 
leaving 
this sucks compared to call of duty 
kevin  see you in class 
hunter  we were going to ask him
to play bass for us 
he says he s pretty good 
it s for the best 
we can never trust a guy like that 
i m telling you 
she s really good 
we need a bass player 
a metal bass player 
she can be metal 
that s the most ridiculous thing
i ve ever heard 
why  why is that the most ridiculous thing
you ve ever heard 
because a cello playing girl
is so non metal
that even thinking about it
is evaporating my balls 
a lot of the time  hunter 
i don t know what you re talking about 
metal  not metal    uh   
maybe i m just not right for skullfucker 
okay  switch places with me 
  what 
  just do it 
slide over 
open the door  but don t get out 
  did you get her number 
  of course i got it 
then  what is it 
i know i said i d get her number 
but i got her snapchat 
  snapchat is actually   
  no  no  no  no  no 
  no  no  no  no 
  it s fine 
  it s the same thing 
  it s not the same thing  you know it 
what 
suck it  cunt 
ow 
go  go  fuck 
go  fuck  fuck 
go  go  go  go  go 
why  why did you do that 
truth to power  bitch  drive 
why 
  faster than a bullet  
  terrifying scream  
  enraged and full of anger  
  he s half man and half machine  
drive  if he gets close enough 
you re just as fucked as i am 
you slow down  you die  that s metal 
that is a dumb keanu reeves movie 
  planets devastated  
oh  shit 
  mankind s on its knees     
watch out  he ll see you in the mirrors
if he gets close enough 
what am i doing  oh  god 
you re an asshole 
  evil s going under deadly wheels  
  he is the painkiller     
okay  we can shake him 
turn left on aspen 
oh 
  don t slow down  keep going straight 
  to where  where 
  there 
  i    we will not fit in there 
i know this car 
fucking do it 
whoo 
  no  no  no 
  whoo 
oh  fuck 
oh  shit 
whoa 
fuck you  fuck you 
dude 
i understand now 
metal is commitment 
and speaking truth to power 
and sticking it to the man  and speed 
that was fucking awesome 
metal is taking the wheel 
what s this 
homework 
black sabbath 
iron maiden 
judas priest 
metallica 
anthrax 
slayer 
megadeth 
motörhead 
guns n  roses 
rage against the machine 
pantera 
emperor  tool  dio 
meshuggah  opeth  slipknot 
mastodon  lamb of god 
this is your history now 
learn it  live it 
do lines of it in the bathroom 
i ll be working on this 
it s the solo to  machinery  
it fucking shreds 
i had these made up 
for luck 
i ll get to work on this  then 
cocks 
fuck me  okay 
ah 
fuck 
  generals gathered in their masses  
  just like witches at black masses  
  evil minds that plot destruction  
  sorcerer of death s construction  
  in the fields  the bodies burning  
  as the war machine keeps turning  
  death and hatred to mankind  
  poisoning their brainwashed minds  
  oh  lord  yeah   
  politicians hide themselves away  
  they only started the war  
  why should they go out to fight   
  they leave that role to the poor  
  yeah   
hey  um   
hi 
man  she s amazing 
maybe hunter ll change his mind about her
when i tell him how much she shreds 
   enunciation and projection 
these are two of the most important tools
in your communications toolbox 
enunciation is the way we shape
the sounds that come out of our mouths 
uh   
dean swanson
wants to see hunter sylvester 
  i think that someone
is trying to kill me  
  infecting my blood  
  and destroying my mind  
they only got
suspended two weeks 
swanson wanted a month 
but their ass rapist coach intervened 
yeah  still  they re gone 
they can t come back
to campus or anything 
but when they come back 
they ll totally ass rape me
for getting them suspended
in the first place 
getting them suspended  it s their fault 
they defaced your hair 
i flicked him in the chops first 
okay  well  at clay moss s party 
they pushed you into the speaker
in front of everybody 
they started it 
yeah  i don t think
your average suburban nazi shitbag
is gonna see it that way 
how is it 
it s cool  yeah  it s cool  yeah 
yeah 
yeah  i kind of look like jason newsted
from metallica  the bass player 
hmm 
oh  right  the one who got fired 
it s more viking than newsted 
yeah  like the school mascot 
no  no  not like the school mascot 
less like the school mascot
than anything on earth 
more like a baby s dick
than the school mascot 
if a baby s dick grew its own baby dick 
then my hair would be more like   
sorry i m so late 
glad you guys are still here 
no    no problem 
no  yeah  not at all 
uh    yeah  um  so   
um   
what do you know 
well  how about you guys start playing
and i ll work my way in 
cool 
um   
how far have you gone in the    the thing   
yeah  i    i got through metallica 
judas priest 
i m in the middle of slayer right now
and i m having a little bit of trouble   
okay  okay  let s try  uh   
let s try  for whom the bell tolls  
okay  you got it  kev 
yeah  okay 
one  two  three  four  one  two 
yeah  okay  cool  all right  man 
let s   
that was cool 
le    um  let s try playing the song 
let s try playing the song 
and we can see
how we vibe together as a band 
and then we ll work on
all the stage show elements later 
right  cool 
two  three  four 
i just   
um  i m  like  kind of getting confused 
 cause i just don t know what else to do 
dude  you can play 
or you can be wasted 
but you can t play wasted 
it s not working out 
we don t need a bass player
to beat those stooges 
just keep it us two 
okay  like  uh    white stripes 
weak  no  here  check this out 
it s just two guys 
it means that we wouldn t have to split
our contest winnings three ways   
something to consider 
that s mean 
yeah  it is 
it doesn t feel
like a good time to tell hunter
that i don t wanna be in a band
that sounds like people being tortured 
but i think it s time for him to seriously
consider the only good option we have 
no  it s a great option 
it is time to speak truth to power 
we have  like  two weeks 
and she can learn everything in two days 
it s nothing personal  emily 
it s just you re not consistent
with the image we re trying to project   
like i told kevin 
is it because she s a girl 
no 
well    what about joan jett 
doesn t she rock 
um  the    what about the runaways 
that s joan jett 
  okay  well  there s lita ford 
  that s the runaways 
and there s  um   
there s  uh    what s her    um   
  kevin 
  uh  what    what s   
  what s the one with the song   
  kevin 
kevin  kevin  kevin  kevin 
kevin  we are a metal band 
we are not an indie metal band 
we are not an alt metal band 
we are not a sort of metal band 
we are a metal band 
and for us to have a cello player
instead of a bass player
would be completely gay 
uh   
  grinder  
  looking for meat  
  grinder  
  wants you to eat  
you ve gotta take all that in context 
gay 
gay  our band is called skullfucker 
skullfucker 
you named it that to impress girls 
we re gonna die virgins
in a band called skullfucker 
what i meant was  we re not   
oh  come on  like she didn t know 
hello 
  hey  it s kevin 
  oh 
hey 
uh  hey  i    wanted to apologize
again for hunter being so rude  and   
  that stuff he said  he   
  it s okay 
i m one too 
hm 
a virgin 
i know  it s a shocker 
oh  um    uh  no 
i was talking about that stuff
he said about girl cello players
in a metal band being gay 
right  sorry  eh   
first of all 
that s a totally messed up thing to say 
well  maybe he s right 
no  he s not  and    you re not 
not what 
are we talking gayness 
or heavy metal  or virginity 
uh  um   
all of them  i think  uh   
they seem related 
you are  right 
gay  i don t think so 
i guess there s sort of a spectrum 
a virgin 
oh  um   
yes  definitely 
hm   
do    you want to 
to   
do you want to not be 
i  uh   
y    yes 
uh  um    uh  do you 
  you know where temple solel is 
  on cleavy  yeah 
will you meet me
in the car park in a half hour 
oh  and can you bring thingies 
for your thingy 
hey  mom  uh   
  i need the car 
  okay 
well  your father should be back
from the shop around 8 00 
  and then we   
  mom  i need the car 
fucking   
i know  i know 
we said 6 15 
it is now 8 00 
  well  something came up 
  what 
what came up 
nothing 
i thought it was something 
you said it was something 
well  i was wrong  it was nothing 
i can imagine something
being more important than a band practice 
actually  i can t 
but i definitely can t see how nothing
could be more important  kevin 
well  nothing
is more important 
or nothing isn t more important 
what i mean   
i don t need abbott and costello
from you  okay 
i need a drummer  a real drummer 
metal is commitment  kevin 
it s dedication  sacrifice 
mortification of the flesh
and all that shit 
it s serious 
and if you re not gonna be 
if you ll be all  girls with cello 
showing up whenever i feel like it  
then this isn t gonna work 
and we won t win the battle of the bands 
and then you re gonna be a loser
for the rest of your life 
hey 
hey 
  hey 
  oh  hey 
hi 
where did you learn how to play 
uh   
i don t know 
my friend just gave me these songs 
and i practiced them 
i m not  you know 
a real drummer or anything

that was intense 
yeah

please  kevin  i promised my sister 
and she s so psyched to have us play 
but ray s not getting out of rehab
for another month 
and we re tired of playing
with a wasted drummer 
  yeah  man 
  fuck that dummy 
i would like to 
but it s like i said 
i m in this band with hunter 
and battle of the bands
is really important to him 
  lots of guys are in two bands 
  eric clapton was in  like  60 bands 
and i heard you play  man 
you could learn our songs in ten minutes 
don t even worry
about the battle of the bands for now 
just my sister s wedding 
  let me think about it 
  i feel you 
but the wedding s this weekend 
so don t think too long 
fuck

mm hmm 
those your meds 
mm hmm 
my happy pills 
don t you need more 
mm mm 
lay on top of me 
not yet 
let s just  um 
lie like this 
i like it 
makes me feel    smooshed 
on the field  when i first saw you   
yeah 
   did it feel    good to
throw stuff and yell at people 
no 
feels good to not want to throw stuff
and yell at people 
you re my happy pill 
mm 
it s only a wedding 
look  you ve got to understand something 
kevin  we don t fit in 
you can try as hard as you want 
you can get yourself a girlfriend 
or whatever  but you still won t fit in 
she doesn t fit in either 
why can t we all not fit in together 
we re not talking about that now 
i don t even wanna go there 
we re talking about you being a traitor   
maybe i wanna talk about it 
i m the founding member of skullfucker 
and i say no yokos 
you said  fuck  
we are both founding members
of skullfucker 
  don t 
  i am way more founding 
i write songs  buy equipment 
designed our facebook page   
oh  fuck our facebook page 
i m the founding member of skullfucker 
and i say no yokos 
  no more fuck 
  shut up 
end of conversation 
no  you    no  you can t just declare
end of conversation 
you don t have that authority 
fine  end of conversation 
and that is how you knit a sweater 
very good  andrea 
did you hear
how she enunciated and projected 
get her all the way in the back  right 
and now  hunter 
 death closes all
but something ere the end
some work of noble note
may yet be done
not unbecoming men that strove with gods  
tennyson s  ulysses  
you might know it from your english class 
this speech is about metal 
metal is about what  ulysses  was about 
striving with gods 
striking out for unknown territory 
the people that crossed the bering strait
12 000 years ago 
metal 
that kon tiki guy 
metal 
the people on the mayflower   
   would ve been metal
if it weren t for all the jesus crap 
and ulysses  what did he do 
huh 
read dante  he ll tell you 
ulysses got together
the baddest ass crew he could find 
and then he sailed off
beyond the pillars of hercules 
and then he was drowned 
and pulled right down to hell 
eighth circle 
what is more metal than that 
only the ninth circle 
so    achieving your dreams
with fellow badasses 
going to hell if you have to   
oh  that sounds great  right 
but it wasn t so easy for ulysses 
see  he had  um   
he had penelope 
mrs  ulysses  keeping him down 
 stay home  
 be king  
 go to work every day  
he wasted decades of his life
on that shit 
hunter 
stop it 
but one day  ulysses decided
he was finished with his woman 
hunter  that s enough 
it was inevitable 
sooner or later  the metal inside him
was bound to rise up   
   and crush
whatever stood in its path 
  fucker  fucking cunt 
  you re fucking crazy 
i ll fucking    i will fucking kill you 
  don t you ever come near me again 
  ow

that was inappropriate 
bordering on inexcusable 
i completely agree 
i m talking about you 
wait  what 
is that what you ve learned
from your interactions
with the vicious morons like skip hoffman 
how to torment people weaker than you 
look  i ve got
some personal issues with her   
i could give a shit about
your personal issues with that poor girl 
you re going to write down
exactly what you did 
if miss johnson corroborates your account 
i ll include it in the disciplinary notice
i ll send to your father 
if she doesn t  i will suspend you 
your friend s a massive dick 
what the fuck 
the fuck you doing 
you are afraid of everybody 
and instead of showing it like i do 
you treat everybody like shit
and you make them hate you 
great  they leave you alone 
they leave me alone 
both of us are alone 
mission accomplished 
  no  no  no   
  no  shut up 
you need me a lot more than i need you 
without me 
all of your dumb fantasies disappear 
but without you 
i might actually live a real life

with everyone else 
you have a right to be mad 
especially at hunter

my parents love me

wrong with you  but   
you re perfect 
you ever get angry 
sometimes 
i get it 
sometimes    also sad 
you know why 
i don t know 
it s because people treat you
like you re invisible

you re better than that 
you re not nothing  you re something
