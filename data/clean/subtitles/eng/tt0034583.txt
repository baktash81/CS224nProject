turned hopefully  or desperately   
toward the freedom of the americas 
lisbon became
the great embarkation point 
but not everybody could get
to lisbon directly 
and so a torturous  roundabout
refugee trail sprang up 
paris to marseilles   
across the mediterranean to oran 
then  by train or auto or foot 
across the rim of africa   
to casablanca in french morocco 
here  the fortunate ones 
through money or influence or luck   
might obtain exit visas
and scurry to lisbon 
and from lisbon to the new world 
but the others wait in casablanca 
and wait and wait   
and wait 
to all officers 
two german couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from oran 
murderer and possible accomplices
headed for casablanca 
round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document 
important 
may we see your papers 
i don t think i have them on me 
  in that case  you ll have to come along 
  wait  it s possible that i   
yes  here they are 
these papers expired three weeks ago 
you ll have to come along 
halt 
  what on earth is going on there 
  i don t know  my dear 
pardon  monsieur  pardon  madame 
have you not heard 
we hear very little 
and we understand even less 
two german couriers
were found murdered in the desert 
the unoccupied desert 
this is the customary roundup
of refugees  liberals   
and  of course  a beautiful young girl
for renault  the prefect of police 
along with these unhappy refugees   
the scum of europe
has gravitated to casablanca 
some of them have been waiting
years for a visa 
i beg of you  monsieur  watch yourself 
be on guard 
this place is full of vultures 
vultures everywhere  everywhere 
  thank you  thank you very much 
  not at all  au revoir  monsieur 
  au revoir  madame 
  au revoir 
what an amusing little fellow 
waiter 
  oh  how silly of me

perhaps tomorrow
we ll be on the plane 
  heil hitler 
  heil hitler 
it is good to see you again 
major strasser 
thank you  thank you 
may i present captain renault  police
prefect of casablanca  major strasser 
unoccupied france welcomes you
to casablanca 
thank you  captain 
it s good to be here 
major strasser  my aide 
lieutenant casselle 
captain tonnelli 
the italian service at your command 
that is kind of you 
you may find the climate
of casablanca a trifle warm 
we germans must get used to all
climates  from russia to the sahara 
perhaps you
weren t referring to weather 
what else 
the murder of the couriers 
what has been done 
my men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects 
but we know already
who the murderer is 
good  is he in custody 
no hurry  tonight he ll be at rick s 
everybody comes to rick s 
i ve already heard about this café 
and also about mr  rick himself 
it had to be you
it had to be you 
i wandered around and finally found
the somebody who 
could make me be true
could make me be blue 
and even be glad just to be sad
thinking of you 
some others i ve seen
might never be mean 
might never be cross  or try to be boss
but they wouldn t do 
for nobody else gave me a thrill 
honey  with all your faults
i love you still 
had to be you  wonderful you
had to be you
 cause my hair is curly 
 cause my teeth are pearly 
waiting  waiting  waiting 
i ll never get out of here 
i ll die in casablanca 
but can t you make it
just a little more 
please 
sorry  but diamonds are a drug on
the market  everybody sells diamonds 
there are diamonds everywhere  2400 
all right 
the trucks are waiting 
the men are waiting  everything   
it s the fishing smack santiago 
it leaves at 1 tomorrow night  here
from the end of la medina  third boat 
  thank you  thank you 
  and bring 15 000 francs in cash 
remember  in cash 
cheerio 
  open up  abdul 
  yes  professor 
  waiter 
  yes  madame 
will you ask rick
if he ll have a drink with us 
he never drinks with customers 
never  i have never seen it 
what makes saloonkeepers so snobbish 
perhaps if you told him   
i ran the second largest
banking house in amsterdam 
second largest 
that wouldn t impress rick 
the leading banker in amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen 
we have something
to look forward to 
and his father is the bellboy 
monsieur 
excuse me 
i m sorry  sir 
this is a private room 
of all the nerve  who do you think    
i know there is gambling in there 
  you dare not keep me out 
  yes  what s the trouble 
i have been in every gambling room
between honolulu and berlin 
and if you think i m going to be kept out
of a saloon like this   
you re much mistaken 
excuse me  please  hello  rick 
your cash is good at the bar 
what  do you know who i am 
i do  you re lucky the bar is open to you 
this is outrageous 
i shall report it to the angriff 
watching you just now  one would
think you ve been doing this all your life 
  what makes you think i haven t 
  nothing 
  but when you first came  i thought   
  you thought what 
what right do i have to think 
may i 
too bad about those two
german couriers  wasn t it 
they got a lucky break 
yesterday they were just clerks   
today they are the honored dead 
you are a very cynical person  rick 
if you ll forgive me for saying so 
i forgive you 
  will you have a drink with me 
  no 
i forgot  you never drink with   
i ll have another  please 
you despise me  don t you 
if i gave you any thought 
i probably would 
but why 
do you object
to the kind of business i do 
but think of all those poor refugees who
must rot here if i didn t help them 
that s not so bad  through ways of
my own  i provide them with exit visas 
for a price  ugarte  for a price 
but think of all the poor devils
who can t meet renault s price 
i get it for them for half 
is that so parasitic 
i don t mind a parasite 
i object to a cut rate one 
well  after tonight i will be through
with the whole business 
and i m leaving  finally 
this casablanca 
who did you bribe for your visa 
renault or yourself 
myself 
i found myself much more reasonable 
look  rick 
know what this is 
something that even you
have never seen 
letters of transit signed
by general de gaulle 
cannot be rescinded 
not even questioned 
one moment 
tonight i ll be selling those
for more money than i ever dreamed of 
and then  addio  casablanca 
i have many a friend in casablanca 
but somehow   
just because you despise me 
you are the only one i trust 
will you keep these for me  please 
  for how long 
  perhaps an hour  perhaps a little longer 
  i don t want them here overnight 
  don t be afraid of that 
please keep them for me 
thank you 
i knew i could trust you 
waiter  i ll be expecting some people 
if anybody asks for me 
i ll be right here 
rick   
i hope you re more impressed
with me now 
if you ll forgive me  i ll share my
good luck with your roulette wheel 
just a moment 
i heard a rumor those two german
couriers were carrying letters of transit 
oh  i ve heard that
rumor too  poor devils 
you re right  ugarte 
i am a little more impressed with you 
  say  who s got trouble 
  we got trouble 
  how much trouble 
  too much trouble 
well  now  don t you frown
just knuckle down and knock on wood 
  who s unhappy 
  we re unhappy 
  how unhappy 
  too unhappy 
uh oh  that won t do
when you are blue just knock on wood 
  who s unlucky 
  we re unlucky 
  how unlucky 
  too unlucky 
but your luck will change
if you ll arrange to knock on wood 
  who s got nothing 
  we got nothing 
  how much nothing 
  too much nothing 
say  nothing s not an awful lot
but knock on wood 
  now who s happy 
  we re happy 
  just how happy 
  very happy 
that s the way we re gonna say
so knock on wood 
  now who s lucky 
  we re all lucky 
  just how lucky 
  very lucky 
well  smile again and once again
let s knock on wood 
  hello  rick 
  hello  ferrari 
how s business at the blue parrot 
  fine  but i d like to buy your café 
  it s not for sale 
  you haven t heard my offer 
  it s not for sale at any price 
  what do you want for sam 
  i don t buy or sell human beings 
too bad 
that s casablanca s leading commodity 
in refugees alone
we could make a fortune   
if you d work with me
in the black market 
suppose you run your business
and let me run mine 
suppose we ask sam 
maybe he d like to make a change 
suppose we do 
when will you realize
that in this world today   
isolationism is no longer
a practical policy 
sam  ferrari wants you to work for him
at the blue parrot 
oh  i like it fine here 
he ll double what i pay you 
i ain t got time to spend
what i make here 
sorry 
the boss s private stock   
     because  yvonne  i love you 
  oh  shut up 
all right  all right  for you  i shut up 
because  yvonne  i love you 
oh  monsieur rick  monsieur rick 
some germans gave this check 
is it all right 
where were you last night 
that s so long ago 
i don t remember 
  will i see you tonight 
  i never make plans that far ahead 
give me another 
  sascha  she s had enough 
  don t listen to him  fill it up 
yvonne  i love you 
but he pays me 
  rick  i m tired of having you   
  sascha  call a cab 
  we re gonna get your coat 
  take your hands off me 
you re going home 
you ve had a little too much to drink 
hey  taxi 
who do you think you are 
pushing me around 
i was a fool
to fall for a man like you 
go with her  sascha 
be sure she gets home 
  and come right back 
  yes  boss 
  hello  rick 
  hello  louis 
how extravagant you are 
throwing away women 
someday they may be scarce 
i think now
i shall pay a call on yvonne 
maybe get her on the rebound 
when it comes to women 
you re a true democrat 
if he gets a word in 
it ll be a major italian victory 
the plane to lisbon 
you would like to be on it 
why  what s in lisbon 
the clipper to america 
i ve often speculated on why
you don t return to america 
did you abscond with the church funds 
did you run off with a senator s wife 
i like to think you killed a man 
it s the romantic in me 
it s a combination of all three 
and what in heaven s name
brought you to casablanca 
my health 
i came to casablanca for the waters 
the waters  what waters 
we re in the desert 
  i was misinformed 
  hm 
excuse me  monsieur rick 
a gentleman inside
has won 20 000 francs   
and the cashier
would like some money 
i ll get it from the safe 
i m so upset  rick  you know i   
forget it  emil  mistakes like that
happen all the time 
i m awfully sorry 
rick  there will be some excitement
here tonight  an arrest in your café 
  again 
  this is no ordinary arrest 
a murderer  no less 
if you re thinking of warning him  don t
put yourself out  he cannot escape 
  i stick my neck out for nobody 
  a wise foreign policy 
could have made the arrest earlier 
at the blue parrot 
out of my regard for you 
we re staging it here 
it will amuse your customers 
our entertainment s enough 
we re to have an important guest
here tonight 
major strasser
of the third reich  no less 
we want him to be here
when we make the arrest 
a demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration 
i see 
and what s strasser doing here 
he certainly didn t come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency 
  perhaps not 
  here 
  it shall not happen again 
  that s all right 
louis  you got something on your mind 
why don t you spill it 
how observant you are 
as a matter of fact 
i wanted to give you a word of advice 
yeah 
  have a brandy 
  thank you 
there are many exit visas
sold in this café   
but we know
that you ve never sold one 
that is the reason
we permit you to remain open 
i thought it was because
i let you win at roulette 
that is another reason 
there is a man arrived in casablanca
on his way to america 
he will offer a fortune to anyone
who ll furnish an exit visa 
  what s his name 
  victor laszlo 
victor laszlo 
rick  that is the first time
i ve seen you so impressed 
he s succeeded in impressing
half the world 
it s my duty to see that
he doesn t impress the other half 
laszlo must never reach america 
he stays in casablanca 
it ll be interesting
to see how he manages 
  manages what 
  his escape 
  but i just told you   
  stop it 
he escaped from
a concentration camp 
the nazis have chased him
all over europe 
  this is the end of the chase 
  twenty thousand francs says it isn t 
is that a serious offer 
i just paid out 20 
and i d like to get it back 
make it 10 
i m only a poor corrupt official 
  okay 
  done 
no matter how clever he is  he still
needs an exit visa  or i should say two 
  why two 
  he is traveling with a lady 
  he ll take one 
  i think not  i ve seen the lady 
and if he did not leave her
in marseilles or oran   
he certainly won t leave her
in casablanca 
maybe he s not quite
as romantic as you are 
it doesn t matter 
there is no exit visa for him 
whatever gave you the impression
that i might help laszlo escape 
because  my dear ricky 
i suspect that under that cynical shell   
you are at heart a sentimentalist 
laugh if you will  but i happen
to be familiar with your record 
let me point out just two items 
in 1935  you ran guns to ethiopia 
in 1936  you fought in spain
on the loyalist side 
and got well paid for it
on both occasions 
the winning side would
have paid you much better 
  maybe 
  uh huh 
it seems you re determined
to keep laszlo here 
i have my orders 
i see  gestapo spank 
my dear ricky  you overestimate
the influence of the gestapo 
i don t interfere with them 
and they don t interfere with me 
in casablanca  i am master of my fate 
  i am   
  major strasser is here  sir 
  you were saying 
  excuse me 
carl  see that major strasser
gets a good table  close to the ladies 
i have already given him the best   
knowing he is german
and would take it anyway 
take him quietly 
two guards at every door 
yes  sir 
  everything is ready  sir 
  go ahead 
  good evening  gentlemen 
  good evening  captain 
  won t you join us 
  thank you 
  it s a pleasure to have you here  major 
  champagne and a tin of caviar 
may i recommend veuve clicquot  26 
a good french wine 
  thank you 
  very well  sir 
  a very interesting club 
  especially so tonight  major 
in a few minutes you ll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers 
i expected no less  captain 
monsieur ugarte 
oh  yes 
  will you please come with us 
  certainly 
may i first please cash my chips 
very lucky  huh 
two thousand  please 
thank you 
rick  rick  help me 
  don t be a fool  you can t get away 
  but  rick  hide me  do something 
excellent  captain 
when they come for me 
i hope you ll be more of a help 
i stick my neck out for nobody 
i m sorry there was a disturbance  folks 
but it s all over now 
just sit down and have a good time 
enjoy yourselves  all right  sam 
okay  boss 
rick 
rick  this is major heinrich strasser
of the third reich 
  how do you do  mr  rick 
  how do you do 
you already know herr heinze
of the third reich 
please join us  mr  rick 
we are very honored tonight 
major strasser is one of the reasons the
third reich enjoys the reputation it has 
you repeat third reich as though
you expected there to be others 
well  personally  major 
i will take what comes 
do you mind
if i ask you a few questions 
  unofficially  of course 
  make it official if you like 
  what is your nationality 
  i m a drunkard 
and that makes rick a citizen
of the world 
i was born in new york city 
if that ll help you any 
i understand you came here from paris
at the time of the occupation 
there seems to be no secret
about that 
are you one of those people   
who cannot imagine the germans
in their beloved paris 
it s not particularly my beloved paris 
can you imagine us in london 
when you get there  ask me 
diplomatist 
how about new york 
well  there are
sections of new york  major   
that i wouldn t advise
you to try to invade 
  who do you think will win the war 
  i haven t the slightest idea 
rick is completely neutral
about everything 
and that takes in the field
of women too 
you were not always
so carefully neutral 
we have a complete dossier on you 
 richard blaine  american  age  37 
cannot return to his country  
the reason is a little vague 
we also know what you did in paris 
and also we know why you left paris 
don t worry 
we re not going to broadcast it 
are my eyes really brown 
you will forgive my curiosity 
mr  blaine  the point is   
an enemy of the reich
has come to casablanca   
and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us 
my interest in whether victor laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one 
in this case you have no sympathy
for the fox 
not particularly  i understand
the point of view of the hound too 
laszlo published the foulest lies
in the prague newspapers   
until the day we marched in 
and even after that  he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar 
of course  one must admit
he has great courage 
i admit he s clever  three times
he slipped through our fingers 
in paris he continued his activities 
we intend not to let it happen again 
excuse me  gentlemen  your business
is politics  mine is running a saloon 
good evening  mr  blaine 
you see  major 
you have nothing to worry about rick 
perhaps 
yes  monsieur 
  i reserved a table  victor laszlo 
  yes  monsieur laszlo  right this way 
two cointreaux  please 
i saw no one of ugarte s description 
victor  i feel somehow
we shouldn t stay here 
if we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us 
perhaps ugarte is in
some other part of the café 
excuse me  but you look like a couple
who are on their way to america 
well 
you ll find a market there for this ring 
i m forced to sell it at a great sacrifice 
  thank you  but i hardly think   
  perhaps for the lady 
the ring is quite unique 
  yes  i m very interested 
  good 
what is your name 
berger  norwegian 
at your service  sir 
victor 
i ll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar 
we don t want the ring 
but thanks for showing it to us 
such a bargain 
but that is your decision 
i m sorry  it is 
  monsieur laszlo  is it not 
  yes 
i am captain renault 
prefect of police 
yes  what is it you want 
merely to welcome you to casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay 
it isn t often we have
so distinguished a visitor 
thank you 
i hope you ll forgive me  captain 
the present french administration
hasn t always been so cordial 
may i present miss ilsa lund 
i was told you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit casablanca 
that was a gross understatement 
you re very kind 
  won t you join us 
  if you will permit me 
oh  no  emile  please  a bottle of your
best champagne  and put it on my bill 
  captain  please 
  it s a game we play 
they put it on the bill 
i tear up the bill  it is very convenient 
captain 
the boy who s playing the piano   
somewhere i ve seen him 
  sam 
  yes 
he came from paris with rick 
rick  who is he 
mademoiselle  you are in rick s 
rick is   
  is what 
  mademoiselle   
he s the kind of man that 
well  if i were a woman   
and i were not around 
i should be in love with rick 
but what a fool i am talking to a
beautiful woman about another man 
excuse me 
major 
mademoiselle lund and monsieur laszlo 
may i present major strasser 
how do you do 
this is a pleasure
i have looked forward to 
i m sure you ll excuse me
if i m not gracious 
you see  major strasser 
i am a czechoslovakian 
you were a czechoslovakian  now
you are a subject of the german reich 
i have never accepted that privilege 
and i m now on french soil 
i d like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on french soil 
this is hardly the time or place 
then we shall state
another time and place 
tomorrow at 10 in the prefect s office 
with mademoiselle 
captain  i am under your authority 
is it your order
that we come to your office 
let us say it is my request 
that is a much more pleasant word 
  very well 
  mademoiselle 
mademoiselle 
a very clever tactical retreat  major 
  this time they really mean to stop me 
  victor  i m afraid for you 
we ve been in difficult places before 
haven t we 
i must find out what berger knows 
  be careful 
  i will  don t worry 
monsieur berger  the ring 
could i see it again 
  yes 
  monsieur 
champagne cocktail  please 
i recognize you from the news
photographs  monsieur laszlo 
in a concentration camp 
one is apt to lose a little weight 
we read five times that you were killed
in five different places 
as you see 
it was true every single time 
thank heaven i found you  berger 
i m looking for a man by the name of
ugarte  he s supposed to help me 
ugarte cannot even help himself 
he s under arrest for murder 
he was arrested here tonight 
i see 
but we who are still free will do
all we can  we are organized 
underground  like everywhere else 
tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the caverne du bois 
if you will come   
monsieur 
will you ask the piano player
to come over here 
very well  mademoiselle 
  how s the jewelry business  berger 
  not so good  check  please 
too bad you weren t here earlier 
we had quite a bit of excitement 
didn t we  berger 
yes  excuse me  gentlemen 
  my bill 
  no  two champagne cocktails  please 
  hello  sam 
  hello  miss ilsa 
i never expected to see you again 
it s been a long time 
yes  ma am 
a lot of water under the bridge 
  some of the old songs  sam 
  yes  ma am 
where is rick 
i don t know 
i ain t seen him all night 
  when will he be back 
  not tonight no more  he ain t coming   
he went home 
  does he always leave so early 
  oh  he never   
well  he s got a girl
up to the blue parrot 
goes up there all the time 
you used to be
a much better liar  sam 
leave him alone  miss ilsa 
you re bad luck to him 
play it once  sam 
for old times  sake 
i don t know what you mean 
miss ilsa 
play it  sam 
play  as time goes by  
i can t remember it  miss ilsa 
i m a little rusty on it 
i ll hum it for you 
sing it  sam 
you must remember this 
a kiss is just a kiss 
a sigh is just a sigh 
the fundamental things apply 
as time goes by 
and when two lovers woo 
they still say   i love you  
on that you can rely 
no matter what the future brings 
as time goes by
sam  i thought i told you
never to play   
well  you were asking about rick 
and here he is  may i present   
  hello  ilsa 
  hello  rick 
oh  you ve already met rick 
mademoiselle  then perhaps you also   
this is mr  laszlo 
  how do you do 
  how do you do 
one hears a great deal about rick
in casablanca 
and about victor laszlo everywhere 
  won t you join us for a drink 
  rick never   
  thanks  i will 
  well   
a precedent is being broken  emile 
  interesting café  i congratulate you 
  i congratulate you 
  what for 
  your work 
thank you  i try 
we all try  you succeed 
she was asking about you
earlier  rick   
in a way that made me
extremely jealous 
i wasn t sure you were the same 
  let s see  the last time we met   
  was la belle aurore 
how nice  you remembered 
but  of course  that was the day
the germans marched into paris 
  not an easy day to forget 
  no 
i remember every detail 
the germans wore gray  you wore blue 
yes  i put that dress away 
when the germans march out
i ll wear it again 
ricky  you re becoming quite human 
i suppose we have to thank you for that 
ilsa  i don t wish to be the one
to say it  but it s late 
so it is 
we have a curfew in casablanca 
it would never do for the chief of police
to be found drinking after hours 
i hope we didn t
overstay our welcome 
not at all 
  your check  sir 
  it s my party 
another precedent gone 
this has been a very interesting evening 
i ll call you a cab 
gasoline rationing  time of night 
  we ll come again 
  anytime 
  say good night to sam for me 
  i will 
there s still nobody in the world who
can play  as time goes by  like sam 
he hasn t played it in a long time 
  good night 
  good night 
night 
a very puzzling fellow  this rick 
what sort is he 
i really can t say 
though i saw him quite often in paris 
  tomorrow at 10  at the prefect office

  good night 
  good night

  shut up and go home  will you 
  no  sir  i m staying right here 
they grab ugarte  then she walks in 
well  that s the way it goes 
one in  one out 
  sam 
 yes  boss 
if it s december 1941 in casablanca 
what time is it in new york 
what 
my watch stopped 
i bet they re asleep in new york 
i bet they re asleep all over america 
of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world   
she walks into mine 
  what s that you re playing 
  a little something of my own 
  stop it  you know what i want to hear 
  no  i don t 
you played it for her 
you can play it for me 
  i don t think i can remember   
  if she can stand it  i can 
play it 
yes  boss 
who are you really 
and what were you before 
what did you do 
and what did you think 
we said no questions 
here s looking at you  kid 
a franc for your thoughts 
in america they d bring only a penny 
i guess that s about all they re worth 
i m willing to be overcharged  tell me 
well  i was wondering   
yes 
why i m so lucky  why i should
find you waiting for me to come along 
  why there is no other man in my life 
  uh huh 
that s easy  there was 
he s dead 
i m sorry for asking 
i forgot we said no questions 
well  only one answer can
take care of all our questions 
nothing can stop them now  wednesday 
thursday at the latest  they ll be in paris 
richard  they ll find out your record 
you won t be safe here 
i m on their blacklist already 
their roll of honor 
moonlight and love songs
never out of date 
hearts full of passion
jealousy and hate 
woman needs man
and man must have his mate 
that no one can deny 
it s still the same old story 
a fight for love and glory 
a case of do or die 
the world will always welcome lovers 
as time goes by
henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more 
says he ll water his garden
with champagne   
before he ll let the germans drink it 
this sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied  doesn t it 
you said it 
here s looking at you  kid 
my german s a little rusty 
it s the gestapo 
they say they expect to be
in paris tomorrow 
they re telling us how to act
when they come marching in 
with the whole world crumbling 
we pick this time to fall in love 
it s pretty bad timing 
  where were you  say  10 years ago 
  10 years ago 
let s see 
yes  i was having a brace put
on my teeth  where were you 
looking for a job 
was that cannon fire 
or is it my heart pounding 
it s the new german 77th  and judging
by the sound  only about 35 miles away 
and getting closer every minute 
here  here  drink up 
we ll never finish the other three 
them germans will be here pretty soon 
and they ll come looking for you 
and don t forget 
there s a price on your head 
i left a note in my apartment 
they ll know where to find me 
it s strange 
  i know so very little about you 
  i know very little about you 
just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened 
be serious  darling  you are in danger 
you must leave paris 
no  we must leave 
yes  of course  we 
the train for marseilles leaves at 5 00 
i ll pick you up at your hotel at 4 30 
no  no  not at my hotel  i   
i have things to do in the city
before i leave 
i ll meet you at the station 
all right  at a quarter to 5 
why don t we get married
in marseilles 
that s too far ahead to plan 
yes  i guess it is too far ahead 
let s seem  what about the engineer 
why can t he marry us on the train 
oh  darling   
why not  the captain on a ship can 
it doesn t seem fair that   
hey  what s wrong  kid 
i love you so much 
and i hate this war so much 
it s a crazy world 
anything can happen 
if you shouldn t get away   
i mean if   
if something should keep us apart   
wherever they put you   
and wherever i ll be 
i want you to know that i   
kiss me 
kiss me as if it were the last time 
all aboard  the last train
leaving in three minutes 
where is she  have you seen her 
i can t find her 
she checked out of the hotel 
but this note came just after you left 
that s the last call  mr  richard 
do you hear me 
come on  mr  richard 
let s get out of here  come on 
  rick  i have to talk to you 
  uh huh 
i saved my first drink
to have with you  here 
  no  rick  not tonight 
  especially tonight 
why did you have to come to
casablanca  there are other places 
i wouldn t have come
if i d known you were here 
believe me  rick  it s true 
i didn t know 
it s funny about your voice 
how it hasn t changed  i can still hear it 
 richard  dear 
i ll go with you anyplace 
   we ll get on a train and never stop  
  don t  rick 
i can understand how you feel 
you understand how i feel 
how long was it we had  honey 
  i didn t count the days 
  well  i did 
every one of them 
mostly i remember the last one 
the wild finish  a guy standing
on a station platform in the rain   
with a comical look on his face   
because his insides
have been kicked out 
can i tell you a story  rick 
does it got a wild finish 
i don t know the finish yet 
go on  tell it  maybe one ll come
to you as you go along 
it s about a girl who had just come
to paris from her home in oslo 
at the house of some friends   
she met a man about whom
she d heard her whole life 
a very great and courageous man 
he opened up for her a whole
beautiful world   
full of knowledge
and thoughts and ideals 
everything she knew
or ever became was because of him 
and she looked up to him   
and worshiped him   
with a feeling
she supposed was love 
yes  that s very pretty 
i heard a story once  in fact 
i ve heard a lot of stories in my time 
they went along with the sound
of a tinny piano   
playing in the parlor downstairs 
 mister  i met a man once
when i was a kid   they d always begin 
i guess neither one of our stories
is very funny 
tell me   
who was it you left me for 
was it laszlo 
or were there others in between   
or aren t you the kind that tells 
i strongly suspect that ugarte left the
letters of transit with mr  blaine 
i would suggest you search
the café immediately 
if rick has the letters  he s too smart
to let you find them there 
you give him credit
for too much cleverness 
my impression was he s just
another blundering american 
we mustn t underestimate
american blundering 
i was with them when they blundered
into berlin in 1918 
as to laszlo 
we want him watched 24 hours a day 
it may interest you to know that at
this very moment he s on his way here 
there is nothing we can do 
i m delighted to see you 
did you have a good night s rest 
i slept very well 
strange  nobody s supposed
to sleep well in casablanca 
  may we proceed 
  with pleasure  won t you sit down 
thank you 
laszlo  we will not mince words 
you re an escaped prisoner of the reich 
so far you have been fortunate
in eluding us 
you have reached casablanca 
it is my duty to see
that you stay in casablanca 
whether or not you will succeed
is problematic 
not at all  renault s signature
is necessary on every visa 
captain  is it possible that laszlo
will receive a visa 
i m afraid not  my regrets  monsieur 
well  perhaps i shall like it
in casablanca 
and mademoiselle 
  you needn t be concerned about me 
  is that all you wish to tell us 
don t be in such a hurry 
you have all the time in the world 
you may be
in casablanca indefinitely 
or you may leave
for lisbon tomorrow 
  on one condition 
  and that is 
you know the leader of the underground
movement in paris  in prague   
brussels  amsterdam   
oslo  belgrade  athens   
  even berlin 
  yes  even in berlin 
if you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts   
you ll have your visa in the morning 
and the honor of having served
the third reich 
i was in a german concentration camp
for a year 
  that s honor enough for a lifetime 
  you will give us the names 
if i didn t give them to you
in a concentration camp   
where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal   
i certainly won t
give them to you now 
and what if you track down
these men and kill them 
what if you murdered all of us 
from every corner of europe  hundreds 
thousands would rise to take our places 
even nazis can t kill that fast 
herr laszlo  you have a reputation for
eloquence which i can now understand 
but in one aspect you are mistaken 
you said the enemies
of the reich could all be replaced 
but there is one exception 
no one could take your place
if anything unfortunate   
should occur to you
while you were trying to escape 
you won t dare
to interfere with me here 
this is still unoccupied france 
any violation of neutrality
would reflect on captain renault 
  monsieur  insofar as it is in my power 
  thank you 
by the way  monsieur  last night
you evinced an interest in signor ugarte 
  yes 
  i believe you have a message for him 
nothing important 
but may i speak to him now 
you would find the conversation
a trifle one sided 
signor ugarte is dead 
i m making out the report now 
we haven t quite decided
whether he committed suicide   
or died trying to escape 
  are you quite finished with us 
  for the time being 
good day 
undoubtedly  their next step will
be to the black market 
excuse me  captain 
another visa problem has come up 
  show her in 
  yes  sir 
sorry  monsieur  we were never
to handle the police 
  this is a job for signor ferrari 
  ferrari 
it can be most helpful
to know signor ferrari 
he pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here 
you will find him at the blue parrot 
thanks 
don t be too downhearted 
perhaps you can
come to terms with renault 
thank you very much  signor 
  hello  ferrari 
  good morning  rick 
the bus is in 
i ll take my shipment with me 
i ll have it sent over 
have a drink with me 
i never drink in the morning 
and every time you send my
shipment over it s a little short 
carrying charges  my boy 
carrying charges 
here  sit down 
there is something i want
to talk over with you  anyhow 
bourbon 
the news about ugarte
upsets me very much 
you re a fat hypocrite  you don t feel
any sorrier for ugarte than i do 
of course not  what upsets me
is that ugarte is dead   
and no one knows where
those letters are 
practically no one 
if i had those letters 
i could make a fortune 
so could i 
and i m a poor businessman 
i have a proposition
for whoever has those letters 
i ll handle the entire transaction 
get rid of the letters  take all the risk 
for a small percentage 
and the carrying charges 
naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses 
that s my proposition
for whoever has those letters 
i ll tell him when he comes in 
rick  i think you know
where those letters are 
you re in good company  renault
and strasser probably think so too 
that s why i came here  to give
them a chance to ransack my place 
rick  don t be a fool  take me into
your confidence  you need a partner 
excuse me  i ll be getting back 
morning 
signor ferrari
is the fat gent at the table 
you will not find a treasure
like this in all morocco 
only 700 francs 
  you re being cheated 
  doesn t matter  thank you 
for friends of rick s
we have a small discount 
did i say 700 francs 
you can have it for 200 
i m sorry i was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night 
doesn t matter 
for special friends of rick s
we have a special discount  100 francs 
your story had me a little confused 
or maybe it was the bourbon 
i have some tablecloths  napkins   
  thank you  i m really not interested 
  please  one minute 
why did you come back  to tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station 
yes 
well  you can tell me now 
i m reasonably sober 
i don t think i will  rick 
why not  after all  i got stuck with
a railway ticket 
i think i m entitled to know 
last night i saw
what has happened to you 
the rick i knew in paris 
i could tell him  he d understand 
but the one who looked at me
with such hatred   
i ll be leaving casablanca soon 
we ll never see each other again 
we knew very little about each other
when we were in love in paris 
if we leave it that way   
maybe we ll remember
those days and not casablanca 
not last night 
did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like 
hiding from the police 
running away all the time 
you can believe that if you want to 
well  i m not running away anymore 
i m settled now 
above a saloon  it s true   
but walk up a flight   
i ll be expecting you 
all the same 
someday you ll lie to laszlo 
you ll be there 
no  rick 
no  you see  victor laszlo
is my husband 
and was 
even when i knew you in paris 
i was just telling monsieur laszlo that
unfortunately i m not able to help him 
you see  my dear 
word has gone around 
as leader of all illegal activities in
casablanca   
i am influential and respected 
but it would not be worth my life
to do anything for monsieur laszlo 
you  however  are a different matter 
signor ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you 
  you mean for me to go on alone 
  and only alone 
i ll stay here and keep on trying 
i m sure in a little while   
might as well be frank  monsieur 
it would take a miracle to get you out 
the germans have outlawed miracles 
we are only interested in two visas 
  please  ilsa  don t be hasty 
  no  victor 
you two will want to discuss this 
excuse me  i ll be at the bar 
no  ilsa 
i won t let you stay here 
you must get to america  believe me 
somehow i will get out and join you 
but if the situation were different   
if i had to stay
and there were only visa for one   
would you take it 
yes  i would 
yes  i see 
when i had trouble getting out of lille 
why didn t you leave me there 
when i was sick
in marseilles for two weeks   
and you were in danger every minute 
why didn t you leave me then 
i meant to 
but something always held me up 
i love you very much  ilsa 
your secret will be safe with me 
ferrari is waiting for our answer 
not more than 50 francs 
we ve decided  signor ferrari 
for the present we will go on looking
for two visas  thank you very much 
well  good luck  but be careful 
  you know you re being shadowed 
  of course  it becomes an instinct 
i observe that you  in one respect 
are a very fortunate man 
i am moved to make one more
suggestion  why  i do not know 
because it cannot possibly profit me 
have you heard about ugarte
and the letters of transit 
yes  something 
those letters were not found on ugarte
when they arrested him 
  you know where they are 
  not for sure 
but i d guess that ugarte
left those letters with monsieur rick 
rick 
a difficult customer  that rick 
one never knows what he ll do or why 
but it is worth a chance 
thank you very much  good day 
goodbye  thank you for your coffee 
i shall miss that
when we leave casablanca 
gracious of you to share it with me 
good day  mademoiselle 
  monsieur 
  good day 
  here s to you  sir 
  good luck 
  i d better be going 
  my check  please 
i have to warn you  sir  this is
a dangerous place  full of vultures 
vultures everywhere 
thanks for everything 
  goodbye 
  it has been a pleasure to meet you 
i m sorry 
monsieur rick  you are getting
to be your best customer 
well  drinking 
i m very pleased with you 
you re beginning
to live like a frenchman 
that was some going over
your men gave my place 
we barely got cleaned up
in time to open 
i told strasser he wouldn t
find the letters here 
but i told my men
to be especially destructive 
you know how
that impresses germans 
rick  have you got
those letters of transit 
louis  are you pro vichy
or free french 
serves me right for asking a direct
question  the subject is closed 
  it looks like you re a little late 
  huh 
so yvonne s gone over to the enemy 
who knows  in her own way  she
may constitute an entire second front 
i think it s time for me to flatter
strasser a little  i ll see you later 
sascha 
french 75s 
put up a whole row of them  sascha 
starting here and ending here 
we will begin with two 
what did you say 
would you kindly repeat it 
  what i said is none of your business 
  i ll make it my business 
i don t like disturbances in my place 
either lay off politics or get out 
you see  captain 
the situation is not as under control
as you believe 
we try to cooperate
with your government 
but we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people 
captain  are you certain
which side you re on 
i have no conviction 
if that s what you mean 
i blow with the wind   
and the prevailing wind
happens to be from vichy 
and if it should change 
surely the reich doesn t admit
that possibility 
we are concerned
about more than casablanca 
we know that every french province
in africa is honeycombed with traitors 
waiting for their chance 
waiting perhaps for a leader 
a leader  like laszlo 
mm hm  i have been thinking 
it s too dangerous to let him go 
it may be too dangerous to let him stay 
i see what you mean 
thank you  carl 
thank you  carl 
sit down  have a brandy with us 
to celebrate our leaving
for america tomorrow 
thank you very much 
i thought you would ask me 
so i brought the good brandy   
and a third glass 
at last the day s came 
frau leuchtag and i
are speaking nothing but english now 
so we should feel at home
when we get to america 
a very nice idea 
  to america 
  to america 
to america 
what watch 
  ten watch 
  such much 
you will get along beautifully
in america 
how is lady luck treating you 
oh  too bad 
you ll find him over there 
  monsieur rick 
  yes 
  could i speak to you  please 
  how d you get in  you re underage 
  i came with captain renault 
  i should have known 
my husband is with me too 
he is  captain renault s getting
broad minded  sit down 
have a drink 
  no  of course not  you mind if i do 
  oh  no 
monsieur rick 
what kind of a man is captain renault 
like any other man  only more so 
no  i mean   
is he trustworthy 
is his word    
just a minute 
who told you to ask me that 
he did  captain renault did 
i thought so  where s your husband 
at the roulette table 
trying to win enough for our exit visas 
oh  of course he s losing 
  how long have you been married 
  eight weeks 
we come from bulgaria 
things are very bad there 
the devil has the people
by the throat 
so jan and i  we   
we do not want our children
to grow up in such a country 
  so you decided to go to america 
  yes 
but we haven t much money   
and traveling is so expensive
and difficult 
it was much more than we thought
to get here 
and then captain renault sees us 
and he is so kind  he wants to help us 
yes  i ll bet 
he tells me he can give us an exit visa 
but we have no money 
  does he know that 
  yes 
  and he s still willing to give you a visa 
  yes 
  and you want to know    
  will he keep his word 
he always has 
monsieur   
you are a man 
if someone loved you very much   
so that your happiness was the only
thing that she wanted in the world   
and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it   
     could you forgive her 
  nobody ever loved me that much 
and he never knew  and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart   
that would be all right 
wouldn t it 
  you want my advice 
  yes  please 
go back to bulgaria 
oh  but if you knew what it means to us
to leave europe  to get to america   
oh  but if jan should find out 
he is such a boy 
in many ways
i am so much older than he is 
yes  well  everybody in casablanca
has problems 
  yours may work out  you ll excuse me 
  thank you  monsieur 
  good evening 
  good evening 
you see  here we are again 
i take that
as a great compliment to sam 
i suppose he means to you
paris of happier days 
he does  could we
have a table close to him 
and as far away
from major strasser as possible 
the geography may be
a little difficult to arrange 
  paul  table 30 
  yes  sir 
right this way  if you please 
i ll have sam play  as time goes by  
i believe that s your favorite tune 
thank you 
  two cognacs  please 
  cognac 
do you wish to place another bet  sir 
no  no  i guess not 
have you tried 22 tonight 
i said 22 
leave it there 
cash it in and don t come back 
are you sure this place is honest 
honest  as honest as the day is long 
how are we doing tonight 
a couple of thousand less
than i thought there would be 
monsieur rick   
he s just a lucky guy 
monsieur rick 
may i get you a cup of coffee 
  no  thanks  carl 
  monsieur rick   
captain renault  may i    
not here 
come to my office in the morning 
we ll do everything businesslike 
  we ll be there at 6 
  i ll be there at 10 
i m very happy for both of you 
still  it s very strange that you won 
well  maybe not so strange 
  i ll see you in the morning 
  thank you  captain renault 
no 
boss  you ve done a beautiful thing 
go away  you crazy russian 
as i suspected 
you re a rank sentimentalist 
yeah  why 
why do you interfere
with my little romances 
put it down as a gesture to love 
well  i ll forgive you this time 
but i ll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond 
and it ll make me very happy
if she loses 
mr  blaine 
i wonder if i could talk to you 
  go ahead 
  well  isn t there some other place 
it s rather confidential 
what i have to say 
  in my office 
  right 
you must know it s very important
i get out of casablanca 
it s my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement 
you know what i ve been doing 
you know what it means to the work 
to the lives of thousands of people   
that i reach america
and continue my work 
i m not interested in politics 
the problems of the world
are not in my department 
i m a saloonkeeper 
my friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record 
you ran guns to ethiopia 
you fought against
the fascists in spain 
what of it 
isn t it strange you re always
fighting on the side of the underdog 
yes  i found that
a very expensive hobby 
but then i never was
much of a businessman 
are you enough of a businessman to
appreciate an offer of 100 000 francs 
  i appreciate it  but i don t accept it 
  200 000 
my friend  you could make it
a million francs or three 
my answer would still be the same 
there must be some reason
why you won t let me 
there is 
i suggest that you ask your wife 
  i beg your pardon 
  i said  ask your wife 
  my wife 
  yes 
play  la marseillaise   play it 
vive la france 
vive la démocratie 
see what i mean  if laszlo s presence in
a café can inspire this demonstration   
what more will his presence
in casablanca bring on 
i advise that this place
be shut up at once 
  but everybody s having a good time 
  yes  much too good a time 
the place is to be closed 
  but i have no excuse to close it 
  find one 
everybody is to leave immediately 
this café is closed until further notice 
clear the room at once 
how can you close me up 
i m shocked  shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here 
  your winnings  sir 
  thank you 
everybody out at once 
after this disturbance it is not safe
for laszlo to stay in casablanca 
this morning you implied it wasn t safe
to leave casablanca 
that is also true  except for one
destination  occupied france 
  occupied france 
  under safe conduct from me 
of what value is that 
you may recall what german guarantees
have been worth in the past 
  there are two other alternatives for him 
  what are they 
the french authorities
may find a reason   
to put him
in the concentration camp here 
the other alternative 
my dear 
perhaps you have already observed   
that in casablanca
human life is cheap 
good night  mademoiselle 
  what happened with rick 
  we ll discuss it later 
our faithful friend is still there 
please don t go
to the underground meeting tonight 
i must 
besides  it isn t often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife 
don t joke  after major strasser s
warning tonight  i m frightened 
tell you the truth 
i m frightened too 
shall i remain here
in a hotel room  hiding 
or shall i carry on the best i can 
whatever i d say 
you would carry on 
victor  why don t you tell me
about rick  what did you find out 
  apparently he has the letters 
  yes 
but no intention of selling them 
you d think if sentiment
wouldn t persuade him  money would 
did he give any reason 
  he suggested i ask you 
  ask me 
yes  he said   ask your wife  
i don t know why he said that 
well  our friend outside will think
we ve retired by now 
i ll be going in a few minutes 
  ilsa  i   
  yes 
when i was
in the concentration camp   
were you lonely in paris 
yes  victor  i was 
i know how it is to be lonely 
is there anything you wish to tell me 
no  victor  there isn t 
i love you very much  my dear 
yes 
yes  i know 
victor  whatever i do 
will you believe that i    
you don t even have to say it 
i ll believe 
good night  dear 
good night 
  victor 
  yes  dear 
be careful 
of course i ll be careful 
well  you are in
pretty good shape  herr rick 
how long can i afford to stay closed 
two weeks  maybe three 
maybe i won t have to 
a bribe has worked before 
in the meantime 
everybody stays on salary 
thank you  herr rick 
sascha will be happy to hear it 
i owe him money 
  you finish locking up  will you  carl 
  i will 
  then i am going to the meeting   
  don t tell me where you re going 
i won t 
good night 
good night  mr  rick 
  how did you get in 
  the stairs from the street 
i told you this morning you d come
around  but this is ahead of schedule 
well  won t you sit down 
  richard  i had to see you 
   richard  again  we re back in paris 
your visit isn t connected
by any chance with the letters of transit 
seems as long as i have those letters
i ll never be lonely 
ask any price you want 
but you must give me the letters 
i went all through that
with your husband  it s no deal 
i know how you feel about me   
but put your feelings aside
for something more important 
i have to hear again
what a great man your husband is   
what an important cause
he s fighting for 
it was your cause too 
in your own way  you were fighting
for the same thing 
i m not fighting for anything
anymore except myself 
i m the only cause i m interested in 
richard 
we loved each other once  if those
days meant anything at all to you   
i wouldn t bring up paris if i were you 
it s poor salesmanship 
listen to me  if you knew what really
happened  if you only knew the truth   
i wouldn t believe you
no matter what you said 
you d say anything now
to get what you want 
you want to feel sorry for yourself 
don t you 
with so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings 
one woman has hurt you   
and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world 
you re a coward and a weakling 
no  oh  richard  i m sorry 
i m sorry  but you are our last hope 
if you don t help us 
victor laszlo will die in casablanca 
what of it 
i m going to die in casablanca 
it s a good spot for it 
now  if you ll   
all right 
i tried to reason with you 
i tried everything 
now  i want those letters 
  get them for me 
  i don t have to  i got them right here 
put them on the table 
no 
for the last time 
put them on the table 
if laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you  you won t stop at anything 
all right 
i ll make it easier for you 
go ahead and shoot 
you ll be doing me a favor 
richard   
i tried to stay away 
i thought i would never see you again 
that you were out of my life 
the day you left paris   
if you knew what i went through 
if you knew how much i loved you 
how much i still love you 
and then 
it wasn t long after we were married
that victor went back to czechoslovakia 
they needed him in prague  but there
the gestapo were waiting for him 
just a two line item in the paper 
 victor laszlo apprehended 
sent to concentration camp  
i was frantic 
for months i tried to get word 
then it came 
he was dead 
shot trying to escape 
i was lonely 
i had nothing  not even hope 
then i met you 
why weren t you honest with me 
why d you keep your marriage a secret 
it wasn t my secret  richard 
victor wanted it that way 
not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage 
that was his way of protecting me 
i knew so much about his work 
if the gestapo found out i was his wife
it would be dangerous for me   
and for those working with us 
and when did you first find out
he was alive 
just before you and i
were to leave paris together 
a friend came and told me
that victor was alive 
they were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of paris 
he was sick  he needed me 
i wanted to tell you 
but i didn t dare 
i knew you wouldn t have left paris 
and the gestapo would have caught you 
well   
well  you know the rest 
well  it s still a story
without an ending 
what about now 
now 
i don t know 
i know that i ll never have the strength
to leave you again 
and laszlo 
you ll help him now  richard  won t you 
you ll see that he gets out 
then he ll have his work 
all that he s been living for 
all except one 
he won t have you 
i can t fight it anymore 
i ran away from you once 
i can t do it again 
oh  i don t know
what s right any longer 
you have to think for both of us 
for all of us 
all right  i will 
here s looking at you  kid 
i wish i didn t love you so much 
  i think we lost them 
  yes 
i m afraid they caught
some of the others 
come inside 
come  mr  laszlo 
i will help you immediately 
thank you 
carl  what happened 
the police break up our meeting 
herr rick 
we escaped at the last moment 
  come up here a minute 
  yes  i come 
turn out the light in the rear entrance 
it might attract the police 
  but sascha always puts out that light 
  tonight he forgot 
yes  i come  i will do it 
  i want you to take miss lund home 
  yes  sir 
it s nothing  just a little cut 
we had to get through a window 
this might come in handy 
thank you 
  had a close one  eh 
  yes  rather 
don t you sometimes wonder
if it s worth all this 
i mean  what you re fighting for 
we might as well question
why we breathe 
if we stop breathing  we ll die 
if we stop fighting our enemies 
the world will die 
what of it 
then it ll be out of its misery 
you know how you sound 
monsieur blaine 
like a man
who s trying to convince himself   
of something
he doesn t believe in his heart 
each of us has a destiny 
for good  or for evil 
  i get the point 
  i wonder if you do 
i wonder if you know that you re trying
to escape from yourself   
and that you ll never succeed 
you seem to know
all about my destiny 
i know a good deal more
about you than you suspect 
i know that you re in love
with a woman 
it s perhaps a strange circumstance   
that we both should be in love
with the same woman 
the first evening
i came into this café   
i knew there was something
between you and ilsa 
since no one is to blame   
i demand no explanation 
i ask only one thing 
you won t give me the letters of transit 
all right 
but i want my wife to be safe 
i ask you as a favor   
to use the letters
to take her away from casablanca 
you love her that much 
apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause 
well  i am also a human being 
yes  i love her that much 
  monsieur laszlo 
  yes 
you ll come with us 
we have a warrant for your arrest 
on what charge 
captain renault will discuss that
with you later 
it seems that destiny
has taken a hand 
you haven t any proof  and you know it 
this isn t germany or occupied france 
all you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days 
you might as well let him go now 
i d advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to laszlo 
if you were to help him escape   
what makes you think
i d stick my neck out for laszlo 
because  one 
you bet 10 000 francs he d escape 
two  you ve got the letters of transit 
don t bother to deny it 
and you might do it simply
because you don t like strasser s looks 
as a matter of fact 
i don t either 
they re all excellent reasons 
don t count too much
on my friendship 
in this matter i m powerless 
besides  i might lose the 10 000 francs 
you re not very subtle 
but you are effective  i get the point 
yes  i have the letters 
but i intend using them myself 
i m leaving casablanca
on tonight s plane  the last plane 
and i m taking a friend with me 
one you ll appreciate 
  what friend 
  ilsa lund 
that ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping laszlo escape 
the last man i want to see in america 
you didn t come here to tell me this 
you have the letters of transit 
you can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please 
why are you still interested
in what happens to laszlo 
i m not  but i am interested
in what happens to ilsa and me 
we have a legal right to go 
that s true   
but people have been held
in casablanca   
in spite of their legal rights 
what makes you think
we want to hold you 
ilsa is laszlo s wife 
she probably knows things
that strasser would like to know 
louis  i ll make a deal with you 
instead of this petty charge against him 
you could get something big   
something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years   
  be quite a feather in your cap  right 
  certainly 
germany   
vichy would be very grateful 
then release him 
you be at my place a half hour
before the plane leaves 
i ll have laszlo come there
to pick up the letters   
and that ll give you grounds
to make the arrest 
you get him  and we get away 
to the germans 
that last will be just a minor annoyance 
there s still something about this
i don t quite understand 
miss lund  she is very beautiful  yes   
but you were never interested
in any woman 
  she isn t just any woman 
  i see 
how do i know you ll keep
your end of the bargain 
i ll make the arrangements now
with laszlo in the visitor s pen 
i m gonna miss you 
you re the only one in casablanca
who has less scruples than i 
oh  thanks 
go ahead  ricky 
call off your watchdogs
when you let him go 
i don t want them around
this afternoon 
i m taking no chances  louis 
not even with you 
should we draw up papers 
or is a handshake good enough 
certainly not good enough 
but since i m in a hurry  it ll have to do 
to get out of casablanca and
go to america    you re a lucky man 
my agreement with sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits  that still goes 
i happen to know he gets 10 percent 
but he s worth 25 
abdul  carl and sascha 
they stay with the place or i don t sell 
of course 
rick s wouldn t be rick s without them 
well  so long 
don t forget you owe rick s
100 cartons of american cigarettes 
i shall remember to pay it to myself 
you re late 
i was informed when laszlo
left the hotel so i knew i d be on time 
  i asked you to tie up your watchdogs 
  he won t be followed here 
this place will never be
the same without you 
i know what you mean  but i ve spoken
to ferrari  you ll still win at roulette 
  is everything ready 
  i have the letters right here 
when we searched the place 
where were they 
sam s piano 
serves me right for not being musical 
here they are 
you better wait in my office 
here 
victor thinks i m leaving with him 
haven t you told him 
not yet 
but you were able to
arrange everything 
everything is quite all right 
we ll tell him at the airport 
the less time to think  the easier 
please trust me 
yes  i will 
  i don t know how to thank you 
  save it  we ve still lots of things to do 
  i brought the money 
  keep it  you ll need it in america 
  but we made a deal 
  never mind that 
  you won t have any trouble in lisbon 
  no  it s all arranged 
good  i ve got the letters here 
made out in blank 
all you have to do is fill
in the signatures 
victor laszlo 
victor laszlo  you re under arrest 
the charge of
accessory to the murder   
of the couriers
from whom the letters were stolen 
you re surprised about my friend ricky 
the explanation is simple 
love  it seems 
has triumphed over virtue  thank   
not so fast  louis  nobody is going
to be arrested  not for a while yet 
  have you lost your mind 
  i have  sit down 
  put that gun down 
  i don t want to shoot you   
but i will if you take one more step 
under the circumstances 
i will sit down 
  keep your hands on the table 
  i wonder if you realize what this means 
i do  we ve got time
to discuss that later 
call off your watchdogs  you said 
just the same  call the airport
and let me hear you tell them 
and remember 
this gun is pointed right at your heart 
that is my least vulnerable spot 
  hello  is that the airport 
  huh 
this is captain renault speaking 
there ll be two letters of transit
for the lisbon plane 
there s to be no trouble about them 
good 
hello  hello 
my car  quickly 
this is major strasser 
have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once 
at once  do you hear 
hello  radio tower 
lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes 
east runway 
visibility  1 ½ miles 
light ground fog 
depth of fog approximately 500 
ceiling unlimited  thank you 
have your man go with laszlo
and take care of his luggage 
certainly  rick  anything you say 
find laszlo s luggage 
put it on the plane 
yes  sir 
this way  please 
if you don t mind  fill in the names 
that ll make it more official 
you think of everything  don t you 
and the names are
mr  and mrs  victor laszlo 
  but why my name  richard 
  because you re getting on that plane 
i don t understand 
what about you 
i m staying with him
till the plane gets away 
no  what has happened 
last night you said   
last night
we said a great many things 
you said
i was to do the thinking for us 
i ve done a lot of it since then 
it adds up to one thing 
you re getting on that plane
with victor where you belong 
  richard  no   
  now  you ve got to listen to me 
any idea what you d have
to look forward to if you stayed here 
chances are we d both wind up
in a concentration camp  true  louis 
i m afraid major strasser would insist 
  you re saying this only to make me go 
  i m saying it because it s true 
inside of us we both know
you belong with victor 
you re part of his work 
the thing that keeps him going 
if that plane leaves
and you re not with him  you ll regret it 
maybe not today  maybe not tomorrow 
but soon  and for the rest of your life 
but what about us 
we ll always have paris 
we didn t have    we d lost it
until you came to casablanca 
we got it back last night 
  when i said i would never leave you 
  and you never will 
but i ve got a job to do too 
where i m going  you can t follow 
what i ve got to do
you can t be any part of 
ilsa  i m no good at being noble 
but it doesn t take much to see
that the problems of three little people   
don t amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world 
someday you ll understand that 
now  now 
here s looking at you  kid 
  everything is in order 
  all except one thing 
there s something you should know 
i don t ask you to explain anything 
i m going to anyway 
it may make a difference to you later on 
  you said you knew about ilsa and me 
  yes 
you didn t know she was at my place
last night when you were 
she came there for the letters of transit 
isn t that true  ilsa 
yes 
she tried everything to get them 
nothing worked 
she did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me 
but that was all over long ago 
for your sake  she pretended it wasn t 
and i let her pretend 
i understand 
  here it is 
  thanks 
i appreciate it 
welcome back to the fight 
this time i know our side will win 
are you ready  ilsa 
yes  i m ready 
goodbye  rick 
god bless you 
you better hurry 
you ll miss that plane 
i was right 
you are a sentimentalist 
stay where you are 
i don t know what you re talking about 
what you just did for laszlo 
that fairy tale you invented
to send ilsa away with him 
i know a little about women  my friend 
she went 
but she knew you were lying 
anyway  thanks for helping me out 
i suppose you know this isn t
going to be pleasant for either of us 
especially for you 
  i ll have to arrest you  of course 
  as soon as the plane goes  louis 
what was the meaning
of that phone call 
victor laszlo is on that plane 
why do you stand here 
why don t you stop him 
ask monsieur rick 
  get away from that phone 
  i advise you not to interfere 
i was willing to shoot captain renault 
and i m willing to shoot you 
  hello 
  put that phone down 
  get me the radio tower 
  put it down 
major strasser has been shot 
round up the usual suspects 
well  rick 
you re not only a sentimentalist   
but you ve become a patriot 
maybe  but it seemed
like a good time to start 
i think perhaps you re right 
it might be a good idea for you to
disappear from casablanca for a while 
there s a free french garrison
over at brazzaville 
  i could be induced to arrange a passage 
  my letter of transit 
i could use a trip 
but it doesn t change our bet 
you still owe me 10 000 francs 
that 10 000 francs
