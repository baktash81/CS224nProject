turned hopefully or desperately
toward the freedom of the americas
lisbon became
the great embarkation point
but not everybody could get
to lisbon directly
and so a torturous roundabout
refugee trail sprang up
paris to marseilles
across the mediterranean to oran
then by train or auto or foot
across the rim of africa
to casablanca in french morocco
here the fortunate ones
through money or influence or luck
might obtain exit visas
and scurry to lisbon
and from lisbon to the new world
but the others wait in casablanca
and wait and wait
and wait
to all officers
two german couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from oran
murderer and possible accomplices
headed for casablanca
round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document
important
may we see your papers
i dont think i have them on me
in that case youll have to come along
wait its possible that i
yes here they are
these papers expired three weeks ago
youll have to come along
halt
what on earth is going on there
i dont know my dear
pardon monsieur pardon madame
have you not heard
we hear very little
and we understand even less
two german couriers
were found murdered in the desert
the unoccupied desert
this is the customary roundup
of refugees liberals
and of course a beautiful young girl
for renault the prefect of police
along with these unhappy refugees
the scum of europe
has gravitated to casablanca
some of them have been waiting
years for a visa
i beg of you monsieur watch yourself
be on guard
this place is full of vultures
vultures everywhere everywhere
thank you thank you very much
not at all au revoir monsieur
au revoir madame
au revoir
what an amusing little fellow
waiter
oh how silly of me
what dear
ive left my wallet in the hotel
perhaps tomorrow
well be on the plane
heil hitler
heil hitler
it is good to see you again
major strasser
thank you thank you
may i present captain renault police
prefect of casablanca major strasser
unoccupied france welcomes you
to casablanca
thank you captain
its good to be here
major strasser my aide
lieutenant casselle
captain tonnelli
the italian service at your command
that is kind of you
you may find the climate
of casablanca a trifle warm
we germans must get used to all
climates from russia to the sahara
perhaps you
werent referring to weather
what else
the murder of the couriers
what has been done
my men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects
but we know already
who the murderer is
good is he in custody
no hurry tonight hell be at ricks
everybody comes to ricks
ive already heard about this café
and also about mr rick himself
it had to be you
it had to be you
i wandered around and finally found
the somebody who
could make me be true
could make me be blue
and even be glad just to be sad
thinking of you
some others ive seen
might never be mean
might never be cross or try to be boss
but they wouldnt do
for nobody else gave me a thrill
honey with all your faults
i love you still
had to be you wonderful you
had to be you
cause my hair is curly
cause my teeth are pearly
waiting waiting waiting
ill never get out of here
ill die in casablanca
but cant you make it
just a little more
please
sorry but diamonds are a drug on
the market everybody sells diamonds
there are diamonds everywhere 2400
all right
the trucks are waiting
the men are waiting everything
its the fishing smack santiago
it leaves at 1 tomorrow night here
from the end of la medina third boat
thank you thank you
and bring 15000 francs in cash
remember in cash
cheerio
open up abdul
yes professor
waiter
yes madame
will you ask rick
if hell have a drink with us
he never drinks with customers
never i have never seen it
what makes saloonkeepers so snobbish
perhaps if you told him
i ran the secondlargest
banking house in amsterdam
second largest
that wouldnt impress rick
the leading banker in amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen
we have something
to look forward to
and his father is the bellboy
monsieur
excuse me
im sorry sir
this is a private room
of all the nerve who do you think
i know there is gambling in there
you dare not keep me out
yes whats the trouble
i have been in every gambling room
between honolulu and berlin
and if you think im going to be kept out
of a saloon like this
youre much mistaken
excuse me please hello rick
your cash is good at the bar
what do you know who i am
i do youre lucky the bar is open to you
this is outrageous
i shall report it to the angriff
watching you just now one would
think youve been doing this all your life
what makes you think i havent
nothing
but when you first came i thought
you thought what
what right do i have to think
may i
too bad about those two
german couriers wasnt it
they got a lucky break
yesterday they were just clerks
today they are the honored dead
you are a very cynical person rick
if youll forgive me for saying so
i forgive you
will you have a drink with me
no
i forgot you never drink with
ill have another please
you despise me dont you
if i gave you any thought
i probably would
but why
do you object
to the kind of business i do
but think of all those poor refugees who
must rot here if i didnt help them
thats not so bad through ways of
my own i provide them with exit visas
for a price ugarte for a price
but think of all the poor devils
who cant meet renaults price
i get it for them for half
is that so parasitic
i dont mind a parasite
i object to a cutrate one
well after tonight i will be through
with the whole business
and im leaving finally
this casablanca
who did you bribe for your visa
renault or yourself
myself
i found myself much more reasonable
look rick
know what this is
something that even you
have never seen
letters of transit signed
by general de gaulle
cannot be rescinded
not even questioned
one moment
tonight ill be selling those
for more money than i ever dreamed of
and then addio casablanca
i have many a friend in casablanca
but somehow
just because you despise me
you are the only one i trust
will you keep these for me please
for how long
perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer
i dont want them here overnight
dont be afraid of that
please keep them for me
thank you
i knew i could trust you
waiter ill be expecting some people
if anybody asks for me
ill be right here
rick
i hope youre more impressed
with me now
if youll forgive me ill share my
good luck with your roulette wheel
just a moment
i heard a rumor those two german
couriers were carrying letters of transit
oh ive heard that
rumor too poor devils
youre right ugarte
i am a little more impressed with you
say whos got trouble
we got trouble
how much trouble
too much trouble
well now dont you frown
just knuckle down and knock on wood
whos unhappy
were unhappy
how unhappy
too unhappy
uhoh that wont do
when you are blue just knock on wood
whos unlucky
were unlucky
how unlucky
too unlucky
but your luck will change
if youll arrange to knock on wood
whos got nothing
we got nothing
how much nothing
too much nothing
say nothings not an awful lot
but knock on wood
now whos happy

thats the way were gonna say
so knock on wood

hello rick
hello ferrari
hows business at the blue parrot
fine but id like to buy your café
its not for sale
you havent heard my offer
its not for sale at any price
what do you want for sam
i dont buy or sell human beings
too bad
thats casablancas leading commodity
in refugees alone
we could make a fortune
if youd work with me
in the black market
suppose you run your business
and let me run mine
suppose we ask sam
maybe hed like to make a change
suppose we do
when will you realize
that in this world today
isolationism is no longer
a practical policy
sam ferrari wants you to work for him
at the blue parrot
oh i like it fine here
hell double what i pay you
i aint got time to spend
what i make here
sorry
the bosss private stock
because yvonne i love you
oh shut up
all right all right for you i shut up
because yvonne i love you
oh monsieur rick monsieur rick
some germans gave this check
is it all right
where were you last night
thats so long ago
i dont remember
will i see you tonight
i never make plans that far ahead
give me another
sascha shes had enough
dont listen to him fill it up
yvonne i love you
but he pays me
rick im tired of having you
sascha call a cab
were gonna get your coat
take your hands off me
youre going home
youve had a little too much to drink
hey taxi
who do you think you are
pushing me around
i was a fool
to fall for a man like you
go with her sascha
be sure she gets home
and come right back
yes boss
hello rick
hello louis
how extravagant you are
throwing away women
someday they may be scarce
i think now
i shall pay a call on yvonne
maybe get her on the rebound
when it comes to women
youre a true democrat
if he gets a word in
itll be a major italian victory
the plane to lisbon
you would like to be on it
why whats in lisbon
the clipper to america
ive often speculated on why
you dont return to america
did you abscond with the church funds
did you run off with a senators wife
i like to think you killed a man
its the romantic in me
its a combination of all three
and what in heavens name
brought you to casablanca
my health
i came to casablanca for the waters
the waters what waters
were in the desert
i was misinformed
hm
excuse me monsieur rick
a gentleman inside
has won 20000 francs
and the cashier
would like some money
ill get it from the safe
im so upset rick you know i
forget it emil mistakes like that
happen all the time
im awfully sorry
rick there will be some excitement
here tonight an arrest in your café
again
this is no ordinary arrest
a murderer no less
if youre thinking of warning him dont
put yourself out he cannot escape
i stick my neck out for nobody
a wise foreign policy
could have made the arrest earlier
at the blue parrot
out of my regard for you
were staging it here
it will amuse your customers
our entertainments enough
were to have an important guest
here tonight
major strasser
of the third reich no less
we want him to be here
when we make the arrest
a demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration
i see
and whats strasser doing here
he certainly didnt come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency
perhaps not
here
it shall not happen again
thats all right
louis you got something on your mind
why dont you spill it
how observant you are
as a matter of fact
i wanted to give you a word of advice
yeah
have a brandy
thank you
there are many exit visas
sold in this café
but we know
that youve never sold one
that is the reason
we permit you to remain open
i thought it was because
i let you win at roulette
that is another reason
there is a man arrived in casablanca
on his way to america
he will offer a fortune to anyone
wholl furnish an exit visa
whats his name
victor laszlo
victor laszlo
rick that is the first time
ive seen you so impressed
hes succeeded in impressing
half the world
its my duty to see that
he doesnt impress the other half
laszlo must never reach america
he stays in casablanca
itll be interesting
to see how he manages
manages what
his escape
but i just told you
stop it
he escaped from
a concentration camp
the nazis have chased him
all over europe
this is the end of the chase
twenty thousand francs says it isnt
is that a serious offer
i just paid out 20
and id like to get it back
make it 10
im only a poor corrupt official
okay
done
no matter how clever he is he still
needs an exit visa or i should say two
why two
he is traveling with a lady
hell take one
i think not ive seen the lady
and if he did not leave her
in marseilles or oran
he certainly wont leave her
in casablanca
maybe hes not quite
as romantic as you are
it doesnt matter
there is no exit visa for him
whatever gave you the impression
that i might help laszlo escape
because my dear ricky
i suspect that under that cynical shell
you are at heart a sentimentalist
laugh if you will but i happen
to be familiar with your record
let me point out just two items
in 1935 you ran guns to ethiopia
in 1936 you fought in spain
on the loyalist side
and got well paid for it
on both occasions
the winning side would
have paid you much better
maybe
uhhuh
it seems youre determined
to keep laszlo here
i have my orders
i see gestapo spank
my dear ricky you overestimate
the influence of the gestapo
i dont interfere with them
and they dont interfere with me
in casablanca i am master of my fate
i am
major strasser is here sir
you were saying
excuse me
carl see that major strasser
gets a good table close to the ladies
i have already given him the best
knowing he is german
and would take it anyway
take him quietly
two guards at every door
yes sir
everything is ready sir
go ahead
good evening gentlemen
good evening captain
wont you join us
thank you
its a pleasure to have you here major
champagne and a tin of caviar
may i recommend veuve clicquot 26
a good french wine
thank you
very well sir
a very interesting club
especially so tonight major
in a few minutes youll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers
i expected no less captain
monsieur ugarte
oh yes
will you please come with us
certainly
may i first please cash my chips
very lucky huh
two thousand please
thank you
rick rick help me
dont be a fool you cant get away
but rick hide me do something
excellent captain
when they come for me
i hope youll be more of a help
i stick my neck out for nobody
im sorry there was a disturbance folks
but its all over now
just sit down and have a good time
enjoy yourselves all right sam
okay boss
rick
rick this is major heinrich strasser
of the third reich
how do you do mr rick
how do you do
you already know herr heinze
of the third reich
please join us mr rick
we are very honored tonight
major strasser is one of the reasons the
third reich enjoys the reputation it has
you repeat third reich as though
you expected there to be others
well personally major
i will take what comes
do you mind
if i ask you a few questions
unofficially of course
make it official if you like
what is your nationality
im a drunkard
and that makes rick a citizen
of the world
i was born in new york city
if thatll help you any
i understand you came here from paris
at the time of the occupation
there seems to be no secret
about that
are you one of those people
who cannot imagine the germans
in their beloved paris
its not particularly my beloved paris
can you imagine us in london
when you get there ask me
diplomatist
how about new york
well there are
sections of new york major
that i wouldnt advise
you to try to invade
who do you think will win the war
i havent the slightest idea
rick is completely neutral
about everything
and that takes in the field
of women too
you were not always
so carefully neutral
we have a complete dossier on you
richard blaine american age 37
cannot return to his country
the reason is a little vague
we also know what you did in paris
and also we know why you left paris
dont worry
were not going to broadcast it
are my eyes really brown
you will forgive my curiosity
mr blaine the point is
an enemy of the reich
has come to casablanca
and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us
my interest in whether victor laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one
in this case you have no sympathy
for the fox
not particularly i understand
the point of view of the hound too
laszlo published the foulest lies
in the prague newspapers
until the day we marched in
and even after that he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar
of course one must admit
he has great courage
i admit hes clever three times
he slipped through our fingers
in paris he continued his activities
we intend not to let it happen again
excuse me gentlemen your business
is politics mine is running a saloon
good evening mr blaine
you see major
you have nothing to worry about rick
perhaps
yes monsieur
i reserved a table victor laszlo
yes monsieur laszlo right this way
two cointreaux please
i saw no one of ugartes description
victor i feel somehow
we shouldnt stay here
if we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us
perhaps ugarte is in
some other part of the café
excuse me but you look like a couple
who are on their way to america
well
youll find a market there for this ring
im forced to sell it at a great sacrifice
thank you but i hardly think
perhaps for the lady
the ring is quite unique
yes im very interested
good
what is your name
berger norwegian
at your service sir
victor
ill meet you in a few minutes
at the bar
we dont want the ring
but thanks for showing it to us
such a bargain
but that is your decision
im sorry it is
monsieur laszlo is it not
yes
i am captain renault
prefect of police
yes what is it you want
merely to welcome you to casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay
it isnt often we have
so distinguished a visitor
thank you
i hope youll forgive me captain
the present french administration
hasnt always been so cordial
may i present miss ilsa lund
i was told you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit casablanca
that was a gross understatement
youre very kind
wont you join us
if you will permit me
oh no emile please a bottle of your
best champagne and put it on my bill
captain please
its a game we play
they put it on the bill
i tear up the bill it is very convenient
captain
the boy whos playing the piano
somewhere ive seen him
sam
yes
he came from paris with rick
rick who is he
mademoiselle you are in ricks
rick is
is what
mademoiselle
hes the kind of man that
well if i were a woman
and i were not around
i should be in love with rick
but what a fool i am talking to a
beautiful woman about another man
excuse me
major
mademoiselle lund and monsieur laszlo
may i present major strasser
how do you do
this is a pleasure
i have looked forward to
im sure youll excuse me
if im not gracious
you see major strasser
i am a czechoslovakian
you were a czechoslovakian now
you are a subject of the german reich
i have never accepted that privilege
and im now on french soil
id like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on french soil
this is hardly the time or place
then we shall state
another time and place
tomorrow at 10 in the prefects office
with mademoiselle
captain i am under your authority
is it your order
that we come to your office
let us say it is my request
that is a much more pleasant word
very well
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
a very clever tactical retreat major
this time they really mean to stop me
victor im afraid for you
weve been in difficult places before
havent we
i must find out what berger knows
be careful
i will dont worry
monsieur berger the ring
could i see it again
yes
monsieur
champagne cocktail please
i recognize you from the news
photographs monsieur laszlo
in a concentration camp
one is apt to lose a little weight
we read five times that you were killed
in five different places
as you see
it was true every single time
thank heaven i found you berger
im looking for a man by the name of
ugarte hes supposed to help me
ugarte cannot even help himself
hes under arrest for murder
he was arrested here tonight
i see
but we who are still free will do
all we can we are organized
underground like everywhere else
tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the caverne du bois
if you will come
monsieur
will you ask the piano player
to come over here
very well mademoiselle
hows the jewelry business berger
not so good check please
too bad you werent here earlier

youre bad luck to him
play it once sam
for old times sake
i dont know what you mean
miss ilsa
play it sam
play as time goes by
i cant remember it miss ilsa
im a little rusty on it
ill hum it for you
sing it sam
you must remember this
a kiss is just a kiss
a sigh is just a sigh
the fundamental things apply
as time goes by
and when two lovers woo
they still say i love you
on that you can rely
no matter what the future brings
as time goes by
sam i thought i told you
never to play
well you were asking about rick
and here he is may i present
hello ilsa
hello rick
oh youve already met rick
mademoiselle then perhaps you also
this is mr laszlo
how do you do
how do you do

in casablanca
and about victor laszlo everywhere
wont you join us for a drink
rick never
thanks i will
well
a precedent is being broken emile
interesting café i congratulate you
i congratulate you
what for
your work
thank you i try
we all try you succeed
she was asking about you
earlier rick
in a way that made me
extremely jealous
i wasnt sure you were the same
lets see the last time we met
was la belle aurore
how nice you remembered
but of course that was the day
the germans marched into paris
not an easy day to forget
no
i remember every detail
the germans wore gray you wore blue
yes i put that dress away
when the germans march out
ill wear it again
ricky youre becoming quite human
i suppose we have to thank you for that
ilsa i dont wish to be the one
to say it but its late
so it is
we have a curfew in casablanca
it would never do for the chief of police
to be found drinking after hours
i hope we didnt
overstay our welcome
not at all
your check sir
its my party
another precedent gone
this has been a very interesting evening
ill call you a cab
gasoline rationing time of night

im on their blacklist already
their roll of honor
moonlight and love songs
never out of date
hearts full of passion
jealousy and hate
woman needs man
and man must have his mate
that no one can deny
its still the same old story
a fight for love and glory
a case of do or die
the world will always welcome lovers
as time goes by
henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more
says hell water his garden
with champagne
before hell let the germans drink it
this sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied doesnt it
you said it
heres looking at you kid
my germans a little rusty
its the gestapo
they say they expect to be
in paris tomorrow
theyre telling us how to act
when they come marching in
with the whole world crumbling
we pick this time to fall in love
its pretty bad timing
where were you say 10 years ago
10 years ago
lets see
yes i was having a brace put
on my teeth where were you
looking for a job
was that cannon fire
or is it my heart pounding
its the new german 77th and judging
by the sound only about 35 miles away
and getting closer every minute
here here drink up
well never finish the other three
them germans will be here pretty soon
and theyll come looking for you
and dont forget
theres a price on your head
i left a note in my apartment
theyll know where to find me

i know so very little about you
i know very little about you
just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened
be serious darling you are in danger
you must leave paris
no we must leave
yes of course we
the train for marseilles leaves at 500
ill pick you up at your hotel at 430

i have things to do in the city
before i leave
ill meet you at the station
all right at a quarter to 5
why dont we get married
in marseilles
thats too far ahead to plan
yes i guess it is too far ahead
lets seem what about the engineer
why cant he marry us on the train
oh darling
why not the captain on a ship can
it doesnt seem fair that
hey whats wrong kid
i love you so much
and i hate this war so much
its a crazy world
anything can happen
if you shouldnt get away
i mean if
if something should keep us apart
wherever they put you
and wherever ill be
i want you to know that i
kiss me
kiss me as if it were the last time
all aboard the last train
leaving in three minutes
where is she have you seen her
i cant find her
she checked out of the hotel
but this note came just after you left
thats the last call mr richard
do you hear me

lets get out of here come on
rick i have to talk to you
uhhuh
i saved my first drink
to have with you here
no rick not tonight
especially tonight
why did you have to come to
casablanca there are other places

i didnt know
its funny about your voice
how it hasnt changed i can still hear it
richard dear
ill go with you anyplace
well get on a train and never stop
dont rick
i can understand how you feel
you understand how i feel
how long was it we had honey
i didnt count the days
well i did
every one of them
mostly i remember the last one
the wild finish a guy standing
on a station platform in the rain
with a comical look on his face
because his insides
have been kicked out
can i tell you a story rick
does it got a wild finish
i dont know the finish yet
go on tell it maybe onell come
to you as you go along
its about a girl who had just come
to paris from her home in oslo
at the house of some friends
she met a man about whom
shed heard her whole life
a very great and courageous man
he opened up for her a whole
beautiful world
full of knowledge
and thoughts and ideals
everything she knew
or ever became was because of him
and she looked up to him
and worshiped him
with a feeling
she supposed was love
yes thats very pretty
i heard a story once in fact
ive heard a lot of stories in my time
they went along with the sound
of a tinny piano
playing in the parlor downstairs
mister i met a man once
when i was a kid theyd always begin
i guess neither one of our stories
is very funny
tell me
who was it you left me for
was it laszlo
or were there others in between
or arent you the kind that tells
i strongly suspect that ugarte left the
letters of transit with mr blaine
i would suggest you search
the café immediately
if rick has the letters hes too smart
to let you find them there
you give him credit
for too much cleverness
my impression was hes just
another blundering american
we mustnt underestimate
american blundering
i was with them when they blundered
into berlin in 1918
as to laszlo
we want him watched 24 hours a day
it may interest you to know that at
this very moment hes on his way here
there is nothing we can do
im delighted to see you
did you have a good nights rest
i slept very well
strange nobodys supposed
to sleep well in casablanca
may we proceed
with pleasure wont you sit down
thank you
laszlo we will not mince words
youre an escaped prisoner of the reich
so far you have been fortunate
in eluding us
you have reached casablanca
it is my duty to see
that you stay in casablanca
whether or not you will succeed
is problematic
not at all renaults signature
is necessary on every visa
captain is it possible that laszlo
will receive a visa
im afraid not my regrets monsieur
well perhaps i shall like it
in casablanca
and mademoiselle
you neednt be concerned about me
is that all you wish to tell us
dont be in such a hurry
you have all the time in the world
you may be
in casablanca indefinitely
or you may leave
for lisbon tomorrow
on one condition
and that is
you know the leader of the underground
movement in paris in prague
brussels amsterdam
oslo belgrade athens
even berlin
yes even in berlin
if you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts
youll have your visa in the morning
and the honor of having served
the third reich
i was in a german concentration camp
for a year
thats honor enough for a lifetime
you will give us the names
if i didnt give them to you
in a concentration camp
where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal
i certainly wont
give them to you now
and what if you track down
these men and kill them
what if you murdered all of us
from every corner of europe hundreds
thousands would rise to take our places
even nazis cant kill that fast
herr laszlo you have a reputation for
eloquence which i can now understand
but in one aspect you are mistaken
you said the enemies
of the reich could all be replaced
but there is one exception
no one could take your place
if anything unfortunate
should occur to you
while you were trying to escape
you wont dare
to interfere with me here
this is still unoccupied france
any violation of neutrality
would reflect on captain renault
monsieur insofar as it is in my power
thank you
by the way monsieur last night
you evinced an interest in signor ugarte
yes
i believe you have a message for him
nothing important
but may i speak to him now
you would find the conversation
a trifle onesided
signor ugarte is dead
im making out the report now
we havent quite decided
whether he committed suicide
or died trying to escape
are you quite finished with us
for the time being
good day
undoubtedly their next step will
be to the black market
excuse me captain
another visa problem has come up
show her in
yes sir
sorry monsieur we were never
to handle the police
this is a job for signor ferrari
ferrari
it can be most helpful
to know signor ferrari
he pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here
you will find him at the blue parrot
thanks
dont be too downhearted
perhaps you can
come to terms with renault
thank you very much signor
hello ferrari
good morning rick
the bus is in
ill take my shipment with me
ill have it sent over
have a drink with me
i never drink in the morning
and every time you send my
shipment over its a little short
carrying charges my boy
carrying charges
here sit down
there is something i want
to talk over with you anyhow
bourbon
the news about ugarte
upsets me very much
youre a fat hypocrite you dont feel
any sorrier for ugarte than i do
of course not what upsets me
is that ugarte is dead
and no one knows where
those letters are
practically no one
if i had those letters
i could make a fortune
so could i
and im a poor businessman
i have a proposition
for whoever has those letters
ill handle the entire transaction
get rid of the letters take all the risk
for a small percentage
and the carrying charges
naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses
thats my proposition
for whoever has those letters
ill tell him when he comes in
rick i think you know
where those letters are
youre in good company renault
and strasser probably think so too
thats why i came here to give
them a chance to ransack my place
rick dont be a fool take me into
your confidence you need a partner
excuse me ill be getting back
morning
signor ferrari
is the fat gent at the table
you will not find a treasure
like this in all morocco
only 700 francs
youre being cheated
doesnt matter thank you
for friends of ricks
we have a small discount
did i say 700 francs
you can have it for 200
im sorry i was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night
doesnt matter
for special friends of ricks
we have a special discount 100 francs
your story had me a little confused
or maybe it was the bourbon
i have some tablecloths napkins
thank you im really not interested
please one minute
why did you come back to tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station
yes
well you can tell me now
im reasonably sober
i dont think i will rick
why not after all i got stuck with
a railway ticket
i think im entitled to know
last night i saw
what has happened to you
the rick i knew in paris
i could tell him hed understand
but the one who looked at me
with such hatred
ill be leaving casablanca soon
well never see each other again
we knew very little about each other
when we were in love in paris
if we leave it that way
maybe well remember
those days and not casablanca
not last night
did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like
hiding from the police
running away all the time
you can believe that if you want to
well im not running away anymore
im settled now
above a saloon its true
but walk up a flight
ill be expecting you
all the same
someday youll lie to laszlo
youll be there
no rick
no you see victor laszlo
is my husband
and was
even when i knew you in paris
i was just telling monsieur laszlo that
unfortunately im not able to help him
you see my dear
word has gone around
as leader of all illegal activities in
casablanca
i am influential and respected
but it would not be worth my life
to do anything for monsieur laszlo
you however are a different matter
signor ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you
you mean for me to go on alone
and only alone
ill stay here and keep on trying
im sure in a little while
might as well be frank monsieur
it would take a miracle to get you out
the germans have outlawed miracles
we are only interested in two visas
please ilsa dont be hasty
no victor
you two will want to discuss this
excuse me ill be at the bar
no ilsa
i wont let you stay here
you must get to america believe me
somehow i will get out and join you
but if the situation were different
if i had to stay
and there were only visa for one
would you take it
yes i would
yes i see
when i had trouble getting out of lille
why didnt you leave me there
when i was sick
in marseilles for two weeks
and you were in danger every minute
why didnt you leave me then
i meant to
but something always held me up
i love you very much ilsa
your secret will be safe with me
ferrari is waiting for our answer
not more than 50 francs
weve decided signor ferrari
for the present we will go on looking
for two visas thank you very much
well good luck but be careful
you know youre being shadowed
of course it becomes an instinct
i observe that you in one respect
are a very fortunate man
i am moved to make one more
suggestion why i do not know
because it cannot possibly profit me
have you heard about ugarte
and the letters of transit
yes something
those letters were not found on ugarte
when they arrested him
you know where they are
not for sure
but id guess that ugarte
left those letters with monsieur rick
rick
a difficult customer that rick
one never knows what hell do or why
but it is worth a chance
thank you very much good day
goodbye thank you for your coffee
i shall miss that
when we leave casablanca
gracious of you to share it with me
good day mademoiselle
monsieur
good day
heres to you sir
good luck
id better be going
my check please
i have to warn you sir this is
a dangerous place full of vultures
vultures everywhere
thanks for everything
goodbye
it has been a pleasure to meet you
im sorry
monsieur rick you are getting
to be your best customer
well drinking
im very pleased with you
youre beginning
to live like a frenchman
that was some goingover
your men gave my place
we barely got cleaned up
in time to open
i told strasser he wouldnt
find the letters here
but i told my men
to be especially destructive
you know how
that impresses germans
rick have you got
those letters of transit
louis are you provichy
or free french
serves me right for asking a direct
question the subject is closed
it looks like youre a little late
huh
so yvonnes gone over to the enemy
who knows in her own way she
may constitute an entire second front
i think its time for me to flatter
strasser a little ill see you later
sascha
french 75s
put up a whole row of them sascha
starting here and ending here
we will begin with two
what did you say
would you kindly repeat it
what i said is none of your business
ill make it my business
i dont like disturbances in my place
either lay off politics or get out
you see captain
the situation is not as under control
as you believe
we try to cooperate
with your government
but we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people
captain are you certain
which side youre on
i have no conviction
if thats what you mean
i blow with the wind
and the prevailing wind
happens to be from vichy
and if it should change
surely the reich doesnt admit
that possibility
we are concerned
about more than casablanca
we know that every french province
in africa is honeycombed with traitors
waiting for their chance
waiting perhaps for a leader
a leader like laszlo
mmhm i have been thinking
its too dangerous to let him go
it may be too dangerous to let him stay
i see what you mean
thank you carl
thank you carl
sit down have a brandy with us
to celebrate our leaving
for america tomorrow
thank you very much
i thought you would ask me
so i brought the good brandy
and a third glass
at last the days came
frau leuchtag and i
are speaking nothing but english now
so we should feel at home
when we get to america
a very nice idea
to america
to america
to america
what watch
ten watch
such much
you will get along beautifully
in america
how is lady luck treating you
oh too bad
youll find him over there
monsieur rick
yes
could i speak to you please
howd you get in youre underage
i came with captain renault
i should have known
my husband is with me too
he is captain renaults getting
broadminded sit down
have a drink
no of course not you mind if i do
oh no
monsieur rick
what kind of a man is captain renault
like any other man only more so
no i mean
is he trustworthy
is his word
just a minute
who told you to ask me that
he did captain renault did
i thought so wheres your husband
at the roulette table
trying to win enough for our exit visas
oh of course hes losing
how long have you been married
eight weeks
we come from bulgaria
things are very bad there
the devil has the people
by the throat
so jan and i we
we do not want our children
to grow up in such a country
so you decided to go to america
yes
but we havent much money
and traveling is so expensive
and difficult
it was much more than we thought
to get here
and then captain renault sees us
and he is so kind he wants to help us
yes ill bet
he tells me he can give us an exit visa
but we have no money
does he know that
yes
and hes still willing to give you a visa
yes
and you want to know
will he keep his word
he always has
monsieur
you are a man
if someone loved you very much
so that your happiness was the only
thing that she wanted in the world
and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it
could you forgive her
nobody ever loved me that much
and he never knew and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart
that would be all right
wouldnt it
you want my advice
yes please
go back to bulgaria
oh but if you knew what it means to us
to leave europe to get to america
oh but if jan should find out
he is such a boy
in many ways
i am so much older than he is
yes well everybody in casablanca
has problems
yours may work out youll excuse me
thank you monsieur
good evening
good evening
you see here we are again
i take that
as a great compliment to sam
i suppose he means to you
paris of happier days
he does could we
have a table close to him
and as far away
from major strasser as possible
the geography may be
a little difficult to arrange
paul table 30
yes sir
right this way if you please
ill have sam play as time goes by
i believe thats your favorite tune
thank you
two cognacs please
cognac
do you wish to place another bet sir
no no i guess not
have you tried 22 tonight
i said 22
leave it there
cash it in and dont come back
are you sure this place is honest
honest as honest as the day is long
how are we doing tonight
a couple of thousand less
than i thought there would be
monsieur rick
hes just a lucky guy
monsieur rick
may i get you a cup of coffee
no thanks carl
monsieur rick
captain renault may i
not here
come to my office in the morning
well do everything businesslike
well be there at 6
ill be there at 10
im very happy for both of you
still its very strange that you won
well maybe not so strange
ill see you in the morning
thank you captain renault
no
boss youve done a beautiful thing
go away you crazy russian
as i suspected
youre a rank sentimentalist
yeah why
why do you interfere
with my little romances
put it down as a gesture to love
well ill forgive you this time
but ill be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond
and itll make me very happy
if she loses
mr blaine
i wonder if i could talk to you
go ahead
well isnt there some other place
its rather confidential
what i have to say
in my office
right
you must know its very important
i get out of casablanca
its my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement
you know what ive been doing
you know what it means to the work
to the lives of thousands of people
that i reach america
and continue my work
im not interested in politics
the problems of the world
are not in my department
im a saloonkeeper
my friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record
you ran guns to ethiopia
you fought against
the fascists in spain
what of it
isnt it strange youre always
fighting on the side of the underdog
yes i found that
a very expensive hobby
but then i never was
much of a businessman
are you enough of a businessman to
appreciate an offer of 100000 francs
i appreciate it but i dont accept it
200000
my friend you could make it
a million francs or three
my answer would still be the same
there must be some reason
why you wont let me
there is
i suggest that you ask your wife
i beg your pardon
i said ask your wife
my wife
yes
play la marseillaise play it
vive la france
vive la démocratie
see what i mean if laszlos presence in
a café can inspire this demonstration
what more will his presence
in casablanca bring on
i advise that this place
be shut up at once
but everybodys having a good time
yes much too good a time
the place is to be closed
but i have no excuse to close it
find one
everybody is to leave immediately
this café is closed until further notice
clear the room at once
how can you close me up
im shocked shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here
your winnings sir
thank you
everybody out at once
after this disturbance it is not safe
for laszlo to stay in casablanca
this morning you implied it wasnt safe
to leave casablanca
that is also true except for one
destination occupied france
occupied france
under safe conduct from me
of what value is that
you may recall what german guarantees
have been worth in the past
there are two other alternatives for him
what are they
the french authorities
may find a reason
to put him
in the concentration camp here
the other alternative
my dear
perhaps you have already observed
that in casablanca
human life is cheap
good night mademoiselle
what happened with rick
well discuss it later
our faithful friend is still there
please dont go
to the underground meeting tonight
i must
besides it isnt often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife
dont joke after major strassers
warning tonight im frightened
tell you the truth
im frightened too
shall i remain here
in a hotel room hiding
or shall i carry on the best i can
whatever id say
you would carry on
victor why dont you tell me
about rick what did you find out
apparently he has the letters
yes
but no intention of selling them
youd think if sentiment
wouldnt persuade him money would
did he give any reason
he suggested i ask you
ask me
yes he said ask your wife
i dont know why he said that
well our friend outside will think
weve retired by now
ill be going in a few minutes
ilsa i
yes
when i was
in the concentration camp
were you lonely in paris
yes victor i was
i know how it is to be lonely
is there anything you wish to tell me
no victor there isnt
i love you very much my dear
yes
yes i know
victor whatever i do
will you believe that i
you dont even have to say it
ill believe
good night dear
good night
victor
yes dear
be careful
of course ill be careful
well you are in
pretty good shape herr rick
how long can i afford to stay closed
two weeks maybe three
maybe i wont have to
a bribe has worked before
in the meantime
everybody stays on salary
thank you herr rick
sascha will be happy to hear it
i owe him money
you finish locking up will you carl
i will
then i am going to the meeting
dont tell me where youre going
i wont
good night
good night mr rick
how did you get in
the stairs from the street
i told you this morning youd come
around but this is ahead of schedule
well wont you sit down
richard i had to see you
richard again were back in paris
your visit isnt connected
by any chance with the letters of transit
seems as long as i have those letters
ill never be lonely
ask any price you want
but you must give me the letters
i went all through that
with your husband its no deal
i know how you feel about me
but put your feelings aside
for something more important
i have to hear again
what a great man your husband is
what an important cause
hes fighting for
it was your cause too
in your own way you were fighting
for the same thing
im not fighting for anything
anymore except myself
im the only cause im interested in
richard
we loved each other once if those
days meant anything at all to you
i wouldnt bring up paris if i were you
its poor salesmanship
listen to me if you knew what really
happened if you only knew the truth
i wouldnt believe you
no matter what you said
youd say anything now
to get what you want
you want to feel sorry for yourself
dont you
with so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings
one woman has hurt you
and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world
youre a coward and a weakling
no oh richard im sorry
im sorry but you are our last hope
if you dont help us
victor laszlo will die in casablanca
what of it
im going to die in casablanca
its a good spot for it
now if youll
all right
i tried to reason with you
i tried everything
now i want those letters
get them for me
i dont have to i got them right here
put them on the table
no
for the last time
put them on the table
if laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you you wont stop at anything
all right
ill make it easier for you
go ahead and shoot
youll be doing me a favor
richard
i tried to stay away
i thought i would never see you again
that you were out of my life
the day you left paris
if you knew what i went through
if you knew how much i loved you
how much i still love you
and then
it wasnt long after we were married
that victor went back to czechoslovakia
they needed him in prague but there
the gestapo were waiting for him
just a twoline item in the paper
victor laszlo apprehended
sent to concentration camp
i was frantic
for months i tried to get word
then it came
he was dead
shot trying to escape
i was lonely
i had nothing not even hope
then i met you
why werent you honest with me
whyd you keep your marriage a secret
it wasnt my secret richard
victor wanted it that way
not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage
that was his way of protecting me
i knew so much about his work
if the gestapo found out i was his wife
it would be dangerous for me
and for those working with us
and when did you first find out
he was alive
just before you and i
were to leave paris together
a friend came and told me
that victor was alive
they were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of paris
he was sick he needed me
i wanted to tell you
but i didnt dare
i knew you wouldnt have left paris
and the gestapo would have caught you
well
well you know the rest
well its still a story
without an ending
what about now
now
i dont know
i know that ill never have the strength
to leave you again
and laszlo
youll help him now richard wont you
youll see that he gets out
then hell have his work
all that hes been living for
all except one
he wont have you
i cant fight it anymore
i ran away from you once
i cant do it again
oh i dont know
whats right any longer
you have to think for both of us
for all of us
all right i will
heres looking at you kid
i wish i didnt love you so much
i think we lost them
yes
im afraid they caught
some of the others
come inside
come mr laszlo
i will help you immediately
thank you
carl what happened
the police break up our meeting
herr rick
we escaped at the last moment
come up here a minute
yes i come
turn out the light in the rear entrance
it might attract the police
but sascha always puts out that light
tonight he forgot
yes i come i will do it
i want you to take miss lund home
yes sir
its nothing just a little cut
we had to get through a window
this might come in handy
thank you
had a close one eh
yes rather
dont you sometimes wonder
if its worth all this
i mean what youre fighting for
we might as well question
why we breathe
if we stop breathing well die
if we stop fighting our enemies
the world will die
what of it
then itll be out of its misery
you know how you sound
monsieur blaine
like a man
whos trying to convince himself
of something
he doesnt believe in his heart
each of us has a destiny
for good or for evil
i get the point
i wonder if you do
i wonder if you know that youre trying
to escape from yourself
and that youll never succeed
you seem to know
all about my destiny
i know a good deal more
about you than you suspect
i know that youre in love
with a woman
its perhaps a strange circumstance
that we both should be in love
with the same woman
the first evening
i came into this café
i knew there was something
between you and ilsa
since no one is to blame
i demand no explanation
i ask only one thing
you wont give me the letters of transit
all right
but i want my wife to be safe
i ask you as a favor
to use the letters
to take her away from casablanca
you love her that much
apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause
well i am also a human being
yes i love her that much
monsieur laszlo
yes
youll come with us
we have a warrant for your arrest
on what charge
captain renault will discuss that
with you later
it seems that destiny
has taken a hand
you havent any proof and you know it
this isnt germany or occupied france
all you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days
you might as well let him go now
id advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to laszlo
if you were to help him escape
what makes you think
id stick my neck out for laszlo
because one
you bet 10000 francs hed escape
two youve got the letters of transit
dont bother to deny it
and you might do it simply
because you dont like strassers looks
as a matter of fact
i dont either
theyre all excellent reasons
dont count too much
on my friendship
in this matter im powerless
besides i might lose the 10000 francs
youre not very subtle
but you are effective i get the point
yes i have the letters
but i intend using them myself
im leaving casablanca
on tonights plane the last plane
and im taking a friend with me
one youll appreciate
what friend
ilsa lund
that ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping laszlo escape
the last man i want to see in america
you didnt come here to tell me this
you have the letters of transit
you can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please
why are you still interested
in what happens to laszlo
im not but i am interested
in what happens to ilsa and me
we have a legal right to go
thats true
but people have been held
in casablanca
in spite of their legal rights
what makes you think
we want to hold you
ilsa is laszlos wife
she probably knows things
that strasser would like to know
louis ill make a deal with you
instead of this petty charge against him
you could get something big
something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years
be quite a feather in your cap right
certainly
germany
vichy would be very grateful
then release him
you be at my place a halfhour
before the plane leaves
ill have laszlo come there
to pick up the letters
and thatll give you grounds
to make the arrest
you get him and we get away
to the germans
that last will be just a minor annoyance
theres still something about this
i dont quite understand
miss lund she is very beautiful yes
but you were never interested
in any woman
she isnt just any woman
i see
how do i know youll keep
your end of the bargain
ill make the arrangements now
with laszlo in the visitors pen
im gonna miss you
youre the only one in casablanca
who has less scruples than i
oh thanks
go ahead ricky
call off your watchdogs
when you let him go
i dont want them around
this afternoon
im taking no chances louis
not even with you
should we draw up papers
or is a handshake good enough
certainly not good enough
but since im in a hurry itll have to do
to get out of casablanca and
go to america youre a lucky man
my agreement with sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits that still goes
i happen to know he gets 10 percent
but hes worth 25
abdul carl and sascha
they stay with the place or i dont sell
of course
ricks wouldnt be ricks without them
well so long
dont forget you owe ricks
100 cartons of american cigarettes
i shall remember to pay it to myself
youre late
i was informed when laszlo
left the hotel so i knew id be on time
i asked you to tie up your watchdogs
he wont be followed here
this place will never be
the same without you
i know what you mean but ive spoken
to ferrari youll still win at roulette
is everything ready
i have the letters right here
when we searched the place
where were they
sams piano
serves me right for not being musical
here they are
you better wait in my office
here
victor thinks im leaving with him
havent you told him
not yet
but you were able to
arrange everything
everything is quite all right
well tell him at the airport
the less time to think the easier
please trust me
yes i will
i dont know how to thank you
save it weve still lots of things to do
i brought the money
keep it youll need it in america
but we made a deal
never mind that
you wont have any trouble in lisbon
no its all arranged
good ive got the letters here
made out in blank
all you have to do is fill
in the signatures
victor laszlo
victor laszlo youre under arrest
the charge of
accessory to the murder
of the couriers
from whom the letters were stolen
youre surprised about my friend ricky
the explanation is simple
love it seems
has triumphed over virtue thank
not so fast louis nobody is going
to be arrested not for a while yet
have you lost your mind
i have sit down
put that gun down
i dont want to shoot you
but i will if you take one more step
under the circumstances
i will sit down
keep your hands on the table
i wonder if you realize what this means
i do weve got time
to discuss that later
call off your watchdogs you said
just the same call the airport
and let me hear you tell them
and remember
this gun is pointed right at your heart
that is my least vulnerable spot
hello is that the airport
huh
this is captain renault speaking
therell be two letters of transit
for the lisbon plane
theres to be no trouble about them
good
hello hello
my car quickly
this is major strasser
have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once
at once do you hear
hello radio tower
lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes
east runway
visibility 1 ½ miles
light ground fog
depth of fog approximately 500
ceiling unlimited thank you
have your man go with laszlo
and take care of his luggage
certainly rick anything you say
find laszlos luggage
put it on the plane
yes sir
this way please
if you dont mind fill in the names
thatll make it more official
you think of everything dont you
and the names are
mr and mrs victor laszlo
but why my name richard
because youre getting on that plane
i dont understand
what about you
im staying with him
till the plane gets away
no what has happened
last night you said
last night
we said a great many things
you said
i was to do the thinking for us
ive done a lot of it since then
it adds up to one thing
youre getting on that plane
with victor where you belong
richard no
now youve got to listen to me
any idea what youd have
to look forward to if you stayed here
chances are wed both wind up
in a concentration camp true louis
im afraid major strasser would insist
youre saying this only to make me go
im saying it because its true
inside of us we both know
you belong with victor
youre part of his work
the thing that keeps him going
if that plane leaves
and youre not with him youll regret it
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow
but soon and for the rest of your life
but what about us
well always have paris
we didnt have wed lost it
until you came to casablanca
we got it back last night
when i said i would never leave you
and you never will
but ive got a job to do too
where im going you cant follow
what ive got to do
you cant be any part of
ilsa im no good at being noble
but it doesnt take much to see
that the problems of three little people
dont amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world
someday youll understand that
now now
heres looking at you kid
everything is in order
all except one thing
theres something you should know
i dont ask you to explain anything
im going to anyway
it may make a difference to you later on
you said you knew about ilsa and me
yes
you didnt know she was at my place
last night when you were
she came there for the letters of transit
isnt that true ilsa
yes
she tried everything to get them
nothing worked
she did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me
but that was all over long ago
for your sake she pretended it wasnt
and i let her pretend
i understand
here it is
thanks
i appreciate it
welcome back to the fight
this time i know our side will win
are you ready ilsa
yes im ready
goodbye rick
god bless you
you better hurry
youll miss that plane
i was right
you are a sentimentalist
stay where you are
i dont know what youre talking about
what you just did for laszlo
that fairy tale you invented
to send ilsa away with him
i know a little about women my friend
she went
but she knew you were lying
anyway thanks for helping me out
i suppose you know this isnt
going to be pleasant for either of us
especially for you
ill have to arrest you of course
as soon as the plane goes louis
what was the meaning
of that phone call
victor laszlo is on that plane
why do you stand here
why dont you stop him
ask monsieur rick
get away from that phone
i advise you not to interfere
i was willing to shoot captain renault
and im willing to shoot you
hello
put that phone down
get me the radio tower
put it down
major strasser has been shot
round up the usual suspects
well rick
youre not only a sentimentalist
but youve become a patriot
maybe but it seemed
like a good time to start
i think perhaps youre right
it might be a good idea for you to
disappear from casablanca for a while
theres a free french garrison
over at brazzaville
i could be induced to arrange a passage
my letter of transit
i could use a trip
but it doesnt change our bet
you still owe me 10000 francs
that 10000 francs
