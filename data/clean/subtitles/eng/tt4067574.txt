oxford movement attempt
effectively romanise church england
get church england away scriptures
king james bible back
ritualistic practices rome

another movement began world biblical scholarship
would almost completely transform
understanding bible
transformation would affected
men protestant profession
strangely worked cooperation rome
music playing
narrator prior th century
protestant scholars depended collection
greek manuscripts come europe
fall constantinople
collectively manuscripts would form foundation
new testament greek used reformers
men like william tyndale martin luther
geneva bible translators translation team
king james version
greek manuscripts collated
first erasmus rotterdam
erasmus would lay foundation traditional text
belief scripture
read people
alexandre vanautgaerden translate french

narrator work begun erasmus
would later continued robert stephanus whose
greek addition would used geneva bible
time work would furthered
famed calvinus scholar theodore beza
bezas greek new testament chiefly
used king james version
would years later elsevier brothers
holland would publish work even
give reformers greek official name
introduction addition
wrote text
received give
nothing changed corrupted
hence greek protestant reformation
would become known textus receptus received texts
christian pinto becomes standard greek
protestant scholars remained
nearly years
narrator th century
german scholar named constantin von tischendorf
would publish would become known
ancient biblical manuscript ever recovered
discovery would turn world bible scholarship
upside convincing many manuscript
lost version bible
pastor david brown go back
german higher criticism
developed theory called recension theory
recension theory
say bible lost
narrator recension theory introduced man named
johann semler th century
one disciples jakob griesbach
would popularize theory among german intellectuals
christian pinto semler griesbach
held unorthodox views christianity say least
semler known father german rationalism
clearly influenced griesbach
rationalism germany much like enlightenment
france rejected idea divinity
christ rejected supernatural elements
bible
virgin birth christ raised dead
ascending
france
unreasonable reason movement
well germany irrational
hence term rationalism
believed irrational believe
things rejected
view semler griesbach
semler griesbach two men
essentially rejected gospel
rationalism known
took hold germany germany became epicenter
higher criticism bible
narrator concentration activity germany
believed working jesuits whose
aim destroy confidence protestants
inerrancy scripture
acknowledged doctor ian paisley
say ongoing war waged rome
jesuits bible
dr ian paisley word man
word god
course rome used burn bibles
used burn people translated
used burn people read
didnt succeed
decided upon another scheme
would place jesuit priests
training protestant ministers
universities germany rome set work
whole structure unbelieving higher criticism
universities men
sought destroy belief bible
became cursed known higher criticism
young men faith bible
destroyed universities training colleges
men came ordained
didnt believe book
didnt believe creeds church
didnt believe historic christian faith
set work destroy faith
pastor david brown spirit textual criticism
nonbelief inspiration word god
looking bible like book scholars
even quote christian scholars
began follow line
christian pinto textual criticism proper sense
necessarily bad thing
dr da waite textual criticism
word used assess value one
great manuscript another
thats
bringing manuscripts together
showing one go
one go
narrator practice textual criticism
began middle ages grew
conflicts rome protestant reformation
often traced th century scholar
named richard simon
dr hd williams one
alleged really begun whole process
hes called father textual criticism
french roman catholic priest
christian pinto world today
textual criticism mean several different things
depending whos using term
applied
textual criticism ordinary sense
simply process going ancient manuscripts
collating trying remove errors
trying figure original text

known higher criticism
give historical analysis manuscripts
begin question whether moses could
really written book genesis
whether peter could written apostles ascribed
begin question authorship
historical nature bible
process usually
traced richard simon
narrator simon entered priesthood
initially educated jesuit priests
later sorbonne paris
would go enter congregation oratory
purpose oratory said
interpose barrier continuous
disquieting progress protestantism
christian pinto orders
simon involved whether jesuits
sorbonne paris oratory
involved variant forms
counter reformation
looking different ways
try overthrow protestant movement
narrator yet simons focus guided jesuits
beginning
laid foundation simons work
one original members
alfonso salmeron joined ignatius loyola
read salmeron paved way richard simon
jesuits introduced catholic reading bible
parameters time place context
semantic structures
christian pinto idea applying principles time
context dont necessarily sound like bad thing
realize used
weapons try undermine bible
one example book written another roman
catholic named isaac la peyrere area
written book called men adam
argued supposedly new information
scientific data come light greenland
china proved men lived earth
far back bc
thus throwing jeopardy traditional date creation
genesis goes back bc
narrator read la peyrere deployed hypothesis
men adam order attack calvinist
method interpreting scripture according
literal sense
christian pinto idea higher criticism
grew movement also called historic
criticism idea behind arrange certain dates
history around bible way make appear
bible historically accurate book
therefore possibly inspired
inerrant word god
thats whole point
narrator la peyreres work would powerful influence
richard simon would
assault reform teaching
read simon sharpened historical criticism
weapon could used attack
protestantisms fundamental error
doctrine sola scriptura
christian pinto sola scriptura
one mottos reformation
means scripture
idea christian faith based
teachings bible alone without interference
doctrines teachings men
contrast roman catholic teaching
says church tradition govern understanding
bible even two disagree
narrator defense catholic faith
richard simon wrote great changes taken
place manuscripts bible
since first originals lost completely
destroy principle protestants
tradition joined scripture
hardly anything religion
one confidently affirm
bible says scriptures alone
sufficient spiritual needs believers
apostle paul wrote scripture given
inspiration god profitable doctrine
reproof correction instruction righteousness
man god may perfect
thoroughly furnished unto good works
furthermore god promises preserve words
eternally lost
psalmist writes thy word true beginning
every one thy righteous judgments endureth forever
jesus said scriptures broken
heaven earth shall pass away
words shall pass away
flesh grass glory
man flower grass
grass withereth flower thereof falleth away
word lord endureth forever
christian pinto
define conflict catholicism
protestantism conflict authority
pope versus authority bible
whole reason bible came
known paper pope protestantism
name given catholics
arguments bible
especially active th century
era constantin von tischendorf went
searching ancient texts
narrator hostility catholics toward protestant
bible written th century historian john dowling
book burning bibles documented
catholics champlain new york burning bibles america
back
beliefs catholics th early th century
shown teaching cardinal james gibbons
pictured president theodore roosevelt
gibbons archbishop baltimore
book faith fathers
wrote scriptures alone
contain truths christian bound
believe contain
truths necessary salvation
similar view espoused england cardinal john
henry newman perhaps leading
catholic apologist th century
speaking bible said surely sacred volume
never intended teach us creed
first error heretics
attempt work unequal
eliciting systematic doctrine
scattered notices truth
scripture contains
christian pinto essentially newman saying
error heretics socalled
followed example ancient boreans
searched scriptures daily
test things hearing
something church rome
always discouraged
narrator one newmans contemporaries
renowned priest named thomas edward bridget
said true faith surrender mind
living authority known divine
puzzle documents doubt
correct interpretation
even modern catholic encyclopedia openly
declares supremacy bible source faith
unhistorical illogical fatal virtue faith
destructive unity
christian pinto see romes view bible
changed years
reformers day trying
recover ancient scripture way
could full understanding
word god
contrast church rome
went looking weaknesses text
protestant doctrine sola scriptura
could overthrown
thats difference
dr hd williams losing people rapidly
text preserved
priesthood believers
losing people roman catholic see
authority
something counter influence
narrator fighting sola
scriptura time arguing defense
latin vulgate declared council
trent true authoritative scripture
dr alan oreilly also condemned
luthers conclusion jeromes vulgate
corrupt bible know
condemned luthers
conclusion produce pure bible
either german english language
go back today
would call traditional text
example greek text new testament
found vast majority
surviving greek manuscripts
narrator introduction douayrheims bible
jesuit scholars wrote se see means
old vulgar latin translation approved good better
greek text cause
give place text copies readings
th century anglican scholar william whitaker
said papists contend latin text
authentic ought
tried text originals
meanwhile protestant scholar francis turretin
summed debate way
said question whether original text
hebrew greek corrupted either
carelessness copyists malice jews
heretics longer held
judge versions judged
roman catholics affirm deny
christian pinto romes position
according turretin greek hebrew
manuscripts corrupted time
could trusted
therefore shouldnt use manuscripts correct
latin vulgate erasmus done back
right reformation began
main issue
narrator also read preface douay
roman catholics contended latin vulgate
translated hebrew greek texts
pure
therefore many contended vulgate version
dictated holy spirit consequently
divine authority regarded even
original hebrew greek texts
hence jesuit scholars reims
concluded latin vulgate better
latin translations
greek text
places disagree
christian pinto
sola scriptura operating two fronts
first part discredit greek hebrew
manuscripts full corruptions errors
could trusted thus proving latin
vogate alone superior text
step two argue bible
difficult interpret necessary rely church
tradition infallible teachings pope
academic environment
developed several hundred years
tischendorf shows
tischendorf embraced rescention theory
idea bible lost needed found
add catholic scholars
like cardinal wiseman argued
truest representation bible
would found latin vulgate
elements came together th century
inspired tischendorf
take famous journey
narrator tischendorfs efforts clearly
aimed traditional greek text
would write last hit upon better
plan set aside textus receptus altogether
construct fresh text
christian pinto curious thing quote
tischendorf says
hit upon better plan mean
sounds though working somebody else
doesnt exactly say
narrator years prior journey
tischendorf influenced prominent catholic scholar
named nicholas cardinal wiseman
cardinal weisman developed theory
old latin texts developed north africa
second century
christian pinto wisemans assertion
seems attempt try prove latin
vulgate closer original manuscripts
known greek manuscript time
theory made tischendorf
partial latin vulgate
narrator read paris
tischendorf prepared edition new testament
intended use catholics
giving latin vulgate greek text
rendered far possible conformable
parallel columns
christian pinto tischendorf
developed greek manuscript
would conform latin vulgate
essentially reversed work erasmus rotterdam
years earlier
remember erasmus collated greek manuscripts
published first ever parallel bible
greek one column latin
used greek correct errors latin
well hundreds years later
tischendorf reverses process
parallel bible way
uses latin correct greek
work catholic archbishop
paris archbishop affre
shows relationship catholic
church time
also worth mentioning one tischendorfs critics
said tischendorf understood greek latin
narrator tischendorf would make great discovery
arrived st catherines monastery
base called mount sinai egypt
arrived took journey rome
received vatican
memoirs tischendorf wrote pass
silence interesting details travels
audience pope gregory xvi may
intercourse cardinal mezzofanti
surprising celebrated linguist
mezzofanti famous ability
speak languages fluently
tischendorf wrote mezzofanti honored
greek verses composed praise
christian pinto tischendorf well
favored rome odd considering
status protestant scholar
pastor david brown never quite figure
protestant scholar one
claimed protestant scholar
would meeting pope situation
theres lot unanswered questions
christian pinto
goes meet private audience pope
like going meet president prime minister
someone position
famous catholic cardinal mezzofanti
writing poem greek praise
great scholar
strange
tischendorf welcomed rome
leading catholic authorities time
fact memoirs reveals
archbishop affre paris
prepared parallel bible
gave recommendation vatican
received pope gregory
narrator tischendorf wrote gregory xvi
prolonged audience granted
took ardent interest undertaking
christian pinto pope gregorys interest tischendorf
curious
especially consider pope
gregory openly condemned protestant bible
societies time
narrator american author john dowling
wrote present pope gregory xvi
predecessor pope leo xii
denounced bible societies declaring bibles
distributed converted gospel christ
human gospel
still worse gospel devil
encyclical bible societies
pope gregory wrote taken great pains
remind faithful ancient laws concerning

narrator
scripture says concerning great harlot mystery
babylon thy sorceries nations deceived

jesuits created many fraudulent
forged documents
could persuade others ordinary means

isidore also known false decretals
elaborate forgery involved series letters

samuel p tregelles fenton john anthony hort
fragellis hort believed sinaiticus real
took sides simonides almost immediately
fragellis wrote story simonides
false absurd possible
response simonides defended argument published
guardian newspaper september

let favourers antiquity manuscript
persuade come brave ordeal
else forever hold peace
yet despite evasiveness tischendorf
newspapers england
defended denounced simonides fraud
attacks almost fanatical
often unreasonable
could tischendorfs relationship rome
something
era protestant historian ja wiley
wrote jesuits influence english media
book jesuits morals maxims plots
said two institutions especial
jesuits lay siege
press pulpit
press great britain already manipulated
extent public little dream
whole english press world supervised
word passed round writers speakers
causes handled
applause condemnation dealt
may accord interests wishes rome
yet simonides without supporters
another paper called literary churchman
questioned antiquity codex sinaiticus
argued simonides heard
said must
profess entire impartiality
though quite ready first admit
importance discovery tischendorf
prepared moment say dr tregelles
statements simonides false absurd
possible tischendorf applies terms
false absurd tregelles
reason tischendorf attacked tregelles
disagreed writing codex sinaiticus
tregelles said one point believe differ
materially tischendorf writing

believe difference attributed scribe
less ink style

places ink ran thin
tischendorf believed signified change writers
hence passage time
tregelles hand believed
scribe
sometimes ran low ink
difference
factor tischendorf spreads scribes
correctors fourth century way
seventh century span years
youre left wondering precise
scientific methods employed
also consider similar contentions
made ancient bones
dug ground
scientists tell us
millions years old forth
really ability date bones way
tischendorf really ability
date ancient manuscripts
initial attacks began
simonides asserted scholars reality
knew little nothing ancient manuscripts
response one critics
wrote neither tischendorf
possess true knowledge paleographical science
learned say random genuine
spurious
know reason
comment might brushed aside often
repeated testimony simonides exceeded
contemporaries expertise

james farrer book literary forgeries
wrote tischendorf senior simonides
five years science paleography
neither knowledge experience
another scholar whose testimony chiefly regarded
henry bradshaw keeper manuscripts

simonides always maintained mt
athos bible meaning codex sinaiticus written

deceived deception intended
mount athos location simonides
claimed created codex
provided many details manuscript written
came mount sinai
also provided many names greek world
said could confirm created manuscript
strangely details
never investigated either supporters
tischendorf newspapers time
james farrer wrote controversy said
settled mere opinions tregelles bradshaw
examined codex two months simonides
made claim work
reason examine suspicion
could motive
drove critical scholars time
simonides real threat academic establishment
western europe
claimed true would shown
tregelles bradshaw hort tischendorf
knew little nothing dating ancient texts
imagine hard fought discredit
simonides working time
man named joseph mayer

mr mayer come examine series

narrator important remember day
monks mount sinai deny tischendorfs story
claim found manuscript rubbish basket

possible tischendorf burned parts

kallinikos suggests

story nobody really seems believe
kallinikos claimed
st catharines monastery
tischendorf
tischendorf took first pages manuscript
without permission
said declare codex dr tischendorf
obtained identical codex simonides wrote inasmuch
saw hands tischendorf
recognized work
kallinikos also claimed manuscript washed
lemon juice herbs weaken appearance
letters give ancient look
response accusations supporters tischendorf
insisted simonides forged letters
claimed kallinikos fictional character
yet book james ferrar tells us kallinikos
indeed real person letters brushed
aside testimony fabulous
yet letters kallinikos bear within
almost prophetic warning codex
wrote newspapers
greatly sin foisting world
new manuscript old one
especially manuscript containing holy scriptures
injury church must accrue
even evidently numerous corrections manuscript
tischendorf originally documented
corrections
today codex sinaiticus home
british library london
finished codex sinaiticus project
aimed fully examining
tischendorfs famous manuscript
interviewed doctor juan garces
one curators project
work still progress
part codex sinaiticus project
gather material commission top scholars

produce history hasnt
written agree well enough
hope july able tell full story
interviewer offscreen truth
assertion von tischendorf found
first manuscript trash barrell
said book found basket
one many voices
make whole history
im position confirm
probable
narrator suspicious answer
heard chose wait finished
research jumping conclusion
yet incredibly british library published
website found omitted
documented history codex sinaiticus
ignored tischendorfs testimony
finding manuscript rubbish basket
instead claim monks
brought attention
said going tell full story
website makes mention four year controversy
constantine simonides
also spoke doctor scott mckendrick head western
manuscripts comparison
sinaiticus codex vaticanus
theyre different also one critical way
sinaiticus two ways actually say
two ways
one vaticanus extent correction
thats critical difference
sinaiticus corrected manuscript greek manuscript
scriptures
second vaticanus strange appearance
look manuscript expert
although know people tell
fourth century manuscript
actually looks like fifteenth century manuscript
theres one simple reason
almost entire text overwritten
fifteenth century scribe
hes added fifteenth century decoration
titling forth
strange appearance
narrator possible reason codex vaticanus
strange even newer appearance
may truly ancient manuscript
earliest recorded date vaticanus
ad first entered
record vatican library
manuscript formerly rejected erasmus
reformers believed corrupt
yet somehow warnings reformation
completely ignored tischendorf
scholars supported
embraced vaticanus without questioning
authenticity
considering may
one romes many historic forgeries
among company scholars fha scrivener
another prominent academic also
opposed constantine simonides
christian pinto strange thing
guys bradshaw scribner tregelles
hort supported codex vaticanus
questioned constantine simonides
understandable would question simonides
accused forgery
makes sense
would take time investigate claims
apply standard vatican
vatican much longer much provable
history forgery fakery fraud
didnt apply standard
examining codex vaticanus doesnt make sense
fact study happened tregelles
example goes vatican library
examine codex vaticanus priest
behaved strange manner
said looking codex
priests room making noise
try distract
said spent much time looking one
page long studying
would come away
almost though didnt want
opportunity study closely
narrator among startling features vaticanus
many omissions
gospels alone leaves
words clauses whole sentences
manuscripts agree things
narrator vaticanus known omissions
sinaiticus famous corrections
many average biblical codex
tischendorf reported corrections
british librarys project complete
number inflated dramatically
bbc documentary latest number corrections
given doctor mckendrick along theological
conclusions said imply
closer inspection text codex sinaiticus
littered revisions
historys altered biblical manuscript
within changes lie real theological secrets
approximately corrections
survives extraordinary rate
correction
means average
corrections page
given quality calligraphy
scholars surprised find many changes
many scribes wrote money
wrote quickly meant sometimes made errors
corrections cant explained way
theological reasons
biblical text could vary
couldnt immutible word god
codex sinaiticus revealing
instability story
volume oldest surviving copy
new testament complete
ancestor bibles
everybody else world
christian pinto right notice
conclusion bbc giving
theyre saying oldest bible supposedly
mistakes variance
proves immutable
inerrant word god hence confirming jesuits
vatican catholic scholars
higher critics arguing hundreds years
attempts destroy process
doctrine sola scriptura
narrator bbc documentary even goes
show influence codex sinaiticus
would specifically undermine protestant faith
king james bible
manuscript offered unique insights
scripture made scholars reevaluate evaluate
bible victorian christians relied
king james bible sturdy black shelves
thought perfect inerrant many people
across english speaking world
mostly bible believing protestants
fact matter scholars known
translations based
rather shaky evidence shaky texts
drove von tischendorf go search
across ancient scriptorius called
dr scot mckendrick manuscript first discovered
met exactly tischendorf looking
words early manuscript christian
bible
particular course subsequently found
earliest complete new testament
narrator codex sinaiticus really
earliest copy new testament
th century work created
constantine simonides
work somehow tampered manipulated
fulfill centuries old agenda
presenting many names dates places
scholars western europe
simonides seemed grow weary debates
one point wrote oppose
evidence living men zealous
defender pseudosinaitic codex
still incredulous say
remain faithful faithlessness
proclaimed truth answer
allseeing god day judgment
therefore spoken sin
wholly constantine simonides
simonides would publish final work
leaving england good
reaffirmed claims sinaiticus
included testimonies believed
yet enemies press continued
insist merely liar forger
charge forgery never proven simonides
traced initial conflict tischendorf
university leipzig
simonides presented first known copy
shepherd hermas greek
christian pinto reason shepherd hermas
important work
embraced early church
western europe known latin
yet scholars knew
originally written greek
nobody ever found copy greek
constantine simonides first man
bring greek copy shepherd hermas
western europe
thats important shepherd hermas
also found part codex sinaiticus
supports idea
could created codex sinaiticus

access greek copy shepherd hermas
hes person world
copy greek version shepherd hermas
thats significant
narrator scholars leipzig
embraced hermas manuscript genuine
tischendorf declared forgery
disagreed latin version
response simonides argued manuscript herams
correct common latin translations
different made accordance
greek originals suit
views latin translators put
mouth hermas doctrinal opinions
eminently calculated strengthen position
catholic church translators belonged
simonides biographer wrote chief dogmas
latin church severely attacked
exposure fraud latin translations
simonides gained much illwill among members
church
right
forgery
narrator charge forgery would
exaggerated english press point
simonides would eventually accused forging nearly
everything came contact
said left england
number men
opposed would become involved new revision
committee king james bible
committee led fenton john anthony hort friend
tregelles among first
embrace codex sinaiticus
leadership committee
would create new greek text fulfillment
tischendorf written
used foundation codex
vaticanus codex sinaiticus
entirely new greek text
different anything existed
narrator hort seems motivated
hatred traditional greek reformation
referred villainous vile textus
receptus
partner anglican bishop named bf wescott
committee members included tregelles
along fha scribener
interesting note committee also invited john
henry newman time catholic priest
declined offer invitation
reveals much theological opinions
wescott hort
dr ronald cooke know theres definite links
roman catholicism different bibles
wescott hort
definitely anglpcatholics best
interviewer offscreen would
call wescott hort anglocatholics
dr ronald cooke yeah would think
would class
whole tractarian movement
going time anglican church
anglocatholic movement john henry newman
later became cardinal roman catholic church
anglican church time john
keeble stride many writers
working make anglicanism roman catholic
wanted introduce many roman
catholic practices angilcanism
anglicans converted roman catholicism
time thousands members
neither anglican ministers
ready convert roman year lord
whole anglocatholic movement
going england
wescott hort
really midst furor
introducing roman catholic ideas anglican church
wescott hort letters
theyre procatholic
narrator one point wescott described seeing pietta
statue catholic mary holding dead body jesus
wrote alone could
knelt hours
hort said theres difference jesus
worship mary worship causes effects
theres strong catholic thing
american committee
phillip shaff
supportive catholicism
narrator philip shaff would lead committee
would develop american standard version bible
based greek text
created wescott hort
like tischendorf shaff met privately pope gregory
th even admitted kissing red slipper
shaff would become known ecumenical profit claimed
promoting germs new theology

shaff somehow suggesting revision committee
part greater agenda
worth considering wescott hort finished
revision king james bible
new greek text openly condemned dean john bergen
published critique titled revision revised
said frankly confess looks
much indeed like language lawyers
called conspiracy
believe jesuits counter
reformation going still today
dr ronald cooke oh yeah
believe thats one main efforts church
rome undo work protestant reformation
think jesuits forefront
battle evil
popes finally disbanded
first pope going poisoned
second pope said would probably
get also signed bill
suppress order suffered long time
agony poison got
reintroduced church
theyre still working today
theyve changed tactics believe
work ecumenical movement
th century vatican would take concept
ecumenical community global level
vatican council ii redefined position
rome religions world
exactly role revision bible
play new movement
world parliament philip schaff
said christ promised us one flock
one shepherd one fold
famous passage john mistranslated
error passed king jamess version
christ flock one many folds
must look therefore much broader union
scripture jesus said way truth
life man cometh unto father
apostle peter declared
neither salvation
none name heaven given
among men whereby must saved
meanwhile apostle paul warned church
said man preach gospel
let accursed
yet men could believe earliest new testament
manuscripts full errors early christians
unsure believe
