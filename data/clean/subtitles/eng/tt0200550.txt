hi im violet sanford
i just recently moved to new york
and i was wondering if you would
give my tape to one of your artists
violet that is so cute
now let me tell you about me
my name is wendy
and i first moved to new york
when i was 2 1 to be a dancer
but i broke my big toe
and then i got knocked up by this actor
who dumped me to join the peace corps
so for the last 1 6 years i been
raisin my daughter all by myself
and then two weeks ago
she tells me that she is a bisexual
and that she hates me more
than any person on this planet
now tell me how i can
help you please
because i am dying
to make your dreams come true
you dont take the tape
unless it comes from an agent
but i cant get an agent
until i get published
if we were to listen to that tape
that would give you grounds
for a copyright
or plagiarism lawsuit
its just a little tape
all i want is someone to sing my songs
welcome to the music business
good evening id please
hi uh sure
maybe
find a way to
make it back someday
what can i get you
let me ask you something
im a songwriter is there someone
here i could talk to about my songs
ive been a struggling
sax player for 1 2 years
what can i get you from the bar
pepsi and some crackers

someone out there

that would be mr odonnell
mr odonnell

in charge of uh finding bands and
booking new talent

so do you always eat breakfast
on the hood of your car
what can i say
im a romantic
you think this is romantic
well you may not be feeling it now
but i think one day
youll be on stage singing
a song about this very night
when we were downwind
from a trash barge
yeah catchy title
hum a few bars
sorry to disappoint you
but im a songwriter not a singer
when i get on stage
i freeze
what if the fate of the free world
rested on your voice
okay if the fate of the free
world depended on me singing
maybe
all i ever really wanted
is to sit in the dark
and hear someone great
singing my songs
i wanna be the one
who writes the music
i remember the first time
my mother played me
bridge over troubled water
by simon and garfunkel
i remember exactly
what she was wearing
i remember exactly how her hair smelled
and i remember exactly how i felt
and every time
i hear that song
i remember exactly
what she was wearing
and exactly
how her hair smelled
and exactly how i felt
cause the great songs last forever
so whats the problem
well
now theyre telling me
the only way to get my songs heard
is to go out there
and sing em myself
so were gonna have to try and fix
this little problem straight away
and how do you propose we do that
well is there any place
you feel comfortable singing
the shower
well start there
i mean i dont care how long
it takes how many hours
we have to spend in that shower
lets get to it
okay before we hit the showers
maybe you could tell me
a little something about yourself
oh really
what do you wanna know
what part of australia
are you from
im from all over
my family moved around a lot
so the rest of your family
doesnt live in new york
do you always ask this many questions
do you always dodge
this many questions
you can at least tell me
where you got all the moves
you pulled on the bar tonight
well if i told you
id id have to kill you
thats original
oh
the suns coming up
were gonna be late
late late for what
this is incredible

be gentle on the keyboard
i borrowed it from the club
you did all this
just to help me sing
i thought maybe we could cure that
stage fright ive heard so much about
kevin i wish you could
come on let me try
tell me what it feels like
you really wanna know
yeah
you asked for it
what are you doing
the only way i can show you
is to make you

the first thing that happens
is my heart starts to race
good
racing heart yep
got it
and then
my entire body starts shaking
shaking body
im im getting that yeah
and
then everything gets a bit
cloudy
clouds are definitely
rolling in
then i start
losing control

i think that audience got more
than they paid for really
whats lms stand for
lynn marie sanford

she died five years ago
she moved to new york to be
a singer when she was my age
she came pretty close
to the big time

she said it was
the scariest place in the world
sounds familiar
you really want me to sing
just tell me
what i have to do
disappear

be alone in the night
i dont like to
hear im wrong
when im right
and i dont like to

you
i dont like to
see a sky painted grey
and i dont like when
nothings going my way

if you wanna write a song if you want
to be like a serious songwriter
