we ve never followed through
on a single thing  you know 
and i think that s
what makes us so special

have the rain on my shoe
hi  i m violet sanford 
i just recently moved to new york   
and i was wondering if you would
give my tape to one of your artists 
violet  that is so cute 
now  let me tell you about me 
my name is wendy 
and i first moved to new york   
when i was 2 1 to be a dancer 
but i broke my big toe 
and then i got knocked up by this actor
who dumped me to join the peace corps 
so for the last 1 6 years i been
raisin  my daughter all by myself 
and then two weeks ago
she tells me that she is a bisexual   
and that she hates me more
than any person on this planet 
now  tell me how i can
help you  please   
because i am dying
to make your dreams come true 
you don t take the tape
unless it comes from an agent   
but i can t get an agent
until i get published 
if we were to listen to that tape 
that would give you grounds   
for a copyright
or plagiarism lawsuit 
it s just a little tape 
all i want is someone to sing my songs 
welcome to the music business 
  good evening  i d   please 
  hi  uh  sure 
maybe
find a way to
make it back someday
  what can i get you 
  let me ask you something 
i m a songwriter  is there someone
here i could talk to about my songs 
i ve been a struggling
sax player for 1 2 years 
  what can i get you from the bar 
  pepsi and some crackers 
hey  how are you doing 
then i hope there s
someone out there
excuse me 
who s that guy 
that would be mr o donnell 
mr o donnell 
he s the manager or something 
yeah  he s the music manager  he s
in charge of  uh  finding bands and   
booking new talent 
run away with my heart
run away with my hope

of the punisher 
this is the holy grail
of comic books 
  you collect comic books 
that s so cute 
  yeah 
it s not cute 
it s very rugged and manly 
  it s just a bit geeky  huh 
  i think it s sweet 
so  do you always eat breakfast
on the hood of your car 
what can i say 
i m a romantic 
you think this is romantic 
well  you may not be feeling it now 
but i think one day   
you ll be on stage singing
a song about this very night 
 when we were downwind
from a trash barge  
yeah  catchy title 
hum a few bars 
sorry to disappoint you 
but i m a songwriter  not a singer 
when i get on stage 
i freeze 
what if the fate of the free world
rested on your voice 
okay  if the fate of the free
world depended on me singing   
maybe 
all i ever really wanted
is to sit in the dark   
and hear someone great
singing my songs 
i wanna be the one
who writes the music 
i remember the first time
my mother played me
 bridge over troubled water    
by simon and garfunkel 
i remember exactly
what she was wearing 
i remember exactly how her hair smelled 
and i remember exactly how i felt 
and every time
i hear that song   
i remember exactly
what she was wearing   
and exactly
how her hair smelled   
and exactly how i felt 
 cause the great songs last forever 
  so  what s the problem 
  well   
now they re telling me
the only way to get my songs heard   
is to go out there
and sing  em myself 
so we re gonna have to try and fix
this little problem straight away 
  and how do you propose we do that 
  well  is there any place
you feel comfortable singing 
  the shower 
  we ll start there 
i mean  i don t care how long
it takes  how many hours
we have to spend in that shower 
  let s get to it 
  okay  before we hit the showers   
maybe you could tell me
a little something about yourself 
oh  really 
what do you wanna know 
what part of australia
are you from 
i m from all over 
my family moved around a lot 
  so the rest of your family
doesn t live in new york

of wrong
what s going on 
why do we need my guitar

okay  now there s a seat 
just there  uh huh 
okay 
take a look 
your fans wanna hear you sing 
i told you  i i can t sing my own songs 
i never could 
well  that s too bad  because they ve
requested to hear your songs 
be gentle on the keyboard 
i borrowed it from the club 
you did all this
just to help me sing 
i thought maybe we could cure that
stage fright i ve heard so much about 
kevin  i wish you could 
come on  let me try 
tell me what it feels like 
you really wanna know 
yeah 
you asked for it 
what are you doing 
the only way i can show you   
is to make you   
really nervous 
the first thing that happens   
is my heart starts to race 
good 
racing heart  yep 
  got it 
  and then   
my entire body starts shaking 
shaking body 
i m    i m getting that  yeah 
and   
then everything gets a bit   
cloudy 
clouds are definitely
rolling in 
then i start   
losing control 
well  how long
does this usually last 
oh  it s been known
to last all night 
  that must be horrible 
  it s excruciating 
i think that audience got more
than they paid for  really 
what s  l m s   stand for 
lynn marie sanford 
it was my mom s guitar 
she died five years ago 
she moved to new york to be
a singer when she was my age 
she came pretty close
to the big time 
well  what happened 
she hated the stage 
she said it was
the scariest place in the world 
sounds familiar 
you really want me to sing 
just tell me
what i have to do 
disappear 
all right  no problem 
i don t like to
be alone in the night
i don t like to
hear i m wrong
when i m right
and i don t like to
have the rain on my shoes
but i do love you
but i do love
you
i don t like to
see a sky painted grey
and i don t like when
nothing s going my way
and i don t like to be
the one with the blues but i do   
if you wanna write a song  if you want
to be like a serious songwriter   
you simply gotta go
with the mac 
laptop  you can lay your tracks down
on a blank cd  and you re done 
do you   
do you have a payment plan 
the way you lay your head upon
  play ball  let s go 
  my shoulder when you sleep
come on  cammie 
oh  i do
and i don t like to
hear i m wrong when i m right
and i don t like to
have the rain on my shoes
but i do love you
jeez  what are you doing

that was my dream 
and at least i did it
with a little bit of dignity 
and i didn t 
that s it

what  so i can t have a boyfriend now 
what kind of stupid shit is that 
hey  this place is my home   
and i m not willing to risk
everything i have on your personal life 
  it s business  plain and simple 
  this is not business 
i worked my ass off for you 
and you re supposed to be my friend 
i never said i was your friend 
i m your boss  and you knew
the rules like everybody else 
will you stop with  the rules  
it s a bar  for christ s sake 
then what are you
so upset about 
please remember
how we laughed
how we cried
how this world
was yours and mine
and how no dream
was out of reach
i stood by you
you stood by me
we took each day
and made it shine
we wrote our names
across the sky
we ran so fast
we ran so free
