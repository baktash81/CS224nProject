 grandpa exclaims 
good afternoon  miss 
sorry i can t stop 
i m off to india 
going to have
a cup of tea with
the maharajah  cheerio 
mr  potts 
i m sorry to
persist about this 
but perhaps you
simply aren t aware
that your children
were running
about in the road 
and after all  you know 
it s not a playground 
it s very     
would you mind
just pressing
that switch there 
switch 
yes  just behind you 
on the right 
the right 
the right 
thank you 
you really ought
to try and exercise
more control over them 
yes  i suppose i could
chain them up  couldn t l 
on a nice long chain 
of course 
so they get
plenty of exercise 
mr  potts 
don t your children
go to school 
oh  i have it now 
you re the
truant officer 
no  i m not
the truant officer 
well  didn t you
ever play truant 
i mean  just once 
no  i most
certainly did not 
i bet you didn t 
would it be too much
to ask what this is 
this  um  thing 
a little invention of mine 
cleans carpets by suction 
all that to clean carpets 
away with sweeping 
and away with brushing 
and away with
dirty carpets 
 laughing 
is that all you do 
mr  potts  invent things 
is that all i do 
and what s this gadget 
well  that s not
quite right yet 
but eventually 
i hope to transmit
moving pictures by wireless 
oh  really 
yes  really 
that s my     
and this 
this  madam 
is a sweet making machine 
and is this one
of the sweets 
yes  it is 
and is it supposed to have
all those holes in it 
no  actually  i think
that the problem is     
the boiling point of
your sugar is too high 
oh  we re an expert on
sweet making  are we 
well 
as a matter of fact     
and an expert
on child welfare 
i was only trying to
help your children 
well  maybe my children
like running wild
in the street 
did that ever occur to you 
i do not see any cause to     
and in any case 
how my children behave
is frankly
no concern of yours 
i was merely trying     
so  if you ll be so good
as to take yourself off
in that fancy
automobile of yours
and go do good
somewhere else 
well  i ve never been     
spoken to that way before 
well  maybe it s about time 
 huffs 
good afternoon  madam 
mind the cable 
vicious  interfering     
 engine sputtering 
if women are
going to drive
motorcars around 
they should learn to
operate one correctly 
well  i suppose
it wouldn t occur to you
to offer to help me 
get in the car  please 
well  for
a mechanically minded man 
mr  potts     
try switching it on 
oh 
hmm 
 engine starts 
 grinding 
open the throttle 
and keep it open 
women 
confounded woman 
who does she think she is 
coming in here
and telling me how
to raise my children 
do i need somebody
to tell me how
to raise my children 
do l  hmm 
no  of course not 
of course not 
where s my cardigan 
under your jacket 
under      yes 
self righteous busybody 
 laughs 
she won t be
bothering us again 
but i liked her 
so did l 
she was very pretty 
she certainly was 
do you think your
father s a crackpot 
your cardigan s
inside out 
oh 
do you think
i m a lunatic 
wasting my time on a lot
of silly inventions 
but they aren t silly 
they re wonderful 
nobody else
could think of them 
that s right  that is right 
nobody else could
think of them 
yes  after all 
what makes the battle
worth the fighting 
what makes the mountain
worth the climb 
what makes the questions
worth the asking 
the reason worth
the rhyme 
 singing  to me 
the answer s clear
it s having someone near
someone dear
someone to care for
to be there for
i have you two
someone to do for
muddle through for
i have you two
someone to share
joy or despair with
whichever betides you
life becomes a chore
unless you re living for
someone to tend to 
be a friend to
i have you two
someone to strive for
do or die for
i have you two
could be we three
get along so famously
 cause you two have me
and i have you two  too
 cheering 
 shattering 
 bell dings 
 tooting 
 sneezes 
both  someone to care for
to be there for
i have you two
someone to do for
muddle through for
i have you two
someone to smile

let s have a look 
yes 
hurry up  man 
yes  sir 
if i may be allowed
to explain  sir 
you have exactly
20 seconds 
yes 
well  the fundamental
novelty of these
particular sweets
is their musical quality 
not only are they
remarkably tasty 
but due to
the unique positioning
of these little holes 
they are capable 
when blown through 
of rendering
a tuneful whistle 
place your fingers
over the holes
and blow thus 
 steam whistle blowing loudly 
tasting time  milord 
too late  had your chance 
muffed it  good morning 
 whispering 
go on  follow him 
milord 
 blowing whistle 
caractacus  sir 
excuse me 
sir  if i may be
allowed to demonstrate 
you see  by blowing air
through this hole
in the center of the sweet
you get a
wonderful sounding     
raspberry 
no  no 
it s more like
a toot  really 
not enough fruit 
too much sugar 
yes  milord 
prepare the peppermint 
beautiful  would you
care to try it  sir 
under no circumstances 
prepare the lemon 
he s not doing
very well  is he 
you know  another
remarkable feature about
these little sweets
is that by
sucking on them     
throw it away 
will you get rid of
this idiot for me 
milord  you 
     in perfect pitch 
they also come in
strawberry  raspberry

and pineapple 
 mouthing  go on

on some all day sucker 
and don t try
a toffee or cream

in sugar confection

30 shillings is
pretty hard to come by 
and when i do get any money 
i need it for my inventions 
well  there isn t
any left 
jeremy and l
have been thinking 
it s our treasure chest 
these things are
enormously valuable 
look  an ivory tusk 
jeremy  that must be
worth a fortune 
jemlma  and diamonds 
and a golden crown 
it s probably
king alfred s 
of course  it needs
cleaning up a little 
take them  daddy 
you can sell them 
and never mind about the car 
you can spend it all
on your inventions 
thank you  children 
all these wonderful things 
they re very precious 
but i m afraid other people
wouldn t appreciate them 
why not  daddy 
because other people
don t see things
the way you do 
come on  now 
let s go to bed 
and don t you worry 
things are going to
come right somehow

your troubles to sea
so close your eyes
on hushabye mountain
wave goodbye to
cares of the day
and watch your boat
from hushabye mountain
sail far away

to protect their

it s useful in the underbrush
to have a hefty spear

as they really are 
after all 
a man with responsibilities
can t walk around
with his head in the clouds
all the time 
a man should keep his feet
solidly on the ground 
oh  a man should have
his dreams
but a man has to learn
to put those dreams
to some practical use 
not just sit around
and think about them
all the time 
both   singing  oh  you
