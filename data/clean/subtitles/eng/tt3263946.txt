mr jackson
members of the jury
id like you to take a look
at the sweet faces
of these beautiful babies
karmen and kameron
barely a year old
and already brimming with life
little amber eagerly waiting
for santas visit
in only two days
now i want you to imagine
these little angels
jury gasps
burning in their beds
this was no arson
this was murder
well i barely poked my head
out the door when
he just stood there with
a strange look in his eyes
thats total bullshit
whispers shut up
to the best of your knowledge
did todd willingham
ever make an attempt
to get back in that house
he was too worried about that
car of his
he didnt try to save those kids
till the cops showed up
and it was like he was
putting on a show
fire talks to you
it does not lie
then what did that fire
tell you
that it was deliberately set
by human hands
mr jackson
can you be more specific
someone poured gasoline
through those childrens room
even under their bed
in the shape of a pentagram
the symbol of the devil
he kept pouring down the hallway
to the front door
creating a fire barrier
preventing any escape
that fire was hotter
than the hinges of hell
we found evidence
of what we call crazed glass
another indication it was goosed
by liquid additive
worst of all the refrigerator
was moved to block the backdoor
someone made that house
into a death trap
inspector vasquez how many
arson cases have you worked on
i reckon more than 1200 fires
and to the best
of your knowledge
have you ever been
mistaken
sir fire does not destroy
evidence it creates it
if ive ever been wrong
its never been pointed out
mr horton
no questions your honor
mr webb you shared a cell
with todd willingham
at the navarro county jail
is that correct
yes sir
and what did he tell you
at that time
well he
he said that
he came home
and that one of his children
was hurt or even dead
or whatever
what
and then so he started
he decided that he was gonna
cover it up by starting a fire
hell no
did he tell you who it was
that injured that child
he did he said it was his wife
what
yeah
he said she was crying
yeah
and carrying on
with such emotion
he just decided to take some
paper and wad it up
and then he burnt it in a way
that made it look like
them children was playing
with it and such
and did willingham ever threaten
you about telling anybody
what he had told you
yeah
he pointed his finger at me
and did like this
ill kill you
thank you mr webb
yall need to start speaking
some fucking truth around here
calm down you just sit down
i am
no no this is corrupt
dont believe that shit
that shit never happened judge
control your client
counselor
todd that shit didnt happen
counselor
you took an oath didnt you
start speaking some
fucking truth then boy
this is my courtroom sir
gavel bangs
judge mr jackson
call your next witness
mr jackson mr evans
you have firsthand knowledge
of todd willinghams history
of violent behavior dont you
yes sir
would you explain to us
what transpired
between the two of you
i mean maybe me and stacy
was flirting a little
but it aint mean nothing
hell stacy shes like that
and todd sort of liked it
wasnt no reason
to beat the crap outta me
sorry your honor
beat me half to death
mr jackson
but mr willinghams propensity
for violence also found its way
into his home
busted lip black eyes
bruises all over her legs
oh and a red mark on her
stomach where he kicked her
mr jackson now mrs king
did she say what she believed
the cause of those beatings
to be
yes sir
stacy was pregnant
and todd wanted to make her
have a miscarriage
gasps and groans
is cathy kings testimony
correct
no sir
so todd didnt beat you up
when he found out
you were pregnant
and tried to force you
to abort
no sir
he even came with me
to the doctor
when i was pregnant
with them twins
he was excited
it might be a boy
so the testimony weve heard
about the beatings
the obscenities
im not saying todd and i
didnt fight
but i gave him just as many
bruises as he gave me
chuckling
is it true that the police
were called to your home
to control a situation
where todd willingham was
intoxicated
and calling you a quote
whore bitch and slut
yeah we was always arguing
it didnt mean nothing
people argue
despite the many occasions
that he behaved
in such a violent manner
how can you be so sure
that he didnt commit this
crime
because he loved those babies
and he loves me
mrs willingham
are you telling us
that all of these witnesses
who have testified to your
husbands violent abuse of you
are just lying
i dont know
do you have any idea why
they would lie
no
now you were raised
by your grandmother
your mother was a victim
of family violence wasnt she
mmhmm
can you tell us
what happened to her
defense objection
irrelevant your honor
overruled
the witness will
answer the question
mrs willingham
mumbles she was
mr jackson im sorry
can you speak up please
she was killed
by your father
yes
no further questions
you dont understand
todd is not like that
todd would never do anything
to hurt those babies
he loved those babies
with all his heart
he treated those babies
better than anybody else did
he would feed them
and change their diapers
and he pottytrained them
and you are not listening
the witness will step down
everybody in here
making up lies no ones paying
attention to the fact
no ones telling the fucking
truth
the witness is excused
no one accepts the truth
or listening to anything
were saying
judge young lady
when do we get a chance
to say the truth
judge you will step down
im sorry todd im sorry
crying
mr horton
call your next witness
your honor the defense rests
are we all clear
on what was just said then
todd
todd now hold on a minute
before they started
digging up her past
yall were clear on that
indistinct arguing
this is the worst kind of crime
there is
and theres been people
called up to this stand
to lie about me people who
just dont like me anyway
i just wanna make sure
i get a fair trial judge
i wash my hands of this
your honor
aint that how this shit works
now ive sat here and stayed
quiet while yall paint
the worst possible
picture of me
aint i got a right to respond
judge
well done son well done
sit down sit down
where are my friends
judge mr jackson
todd where are my family
call your next witness
people who can vouch for me
sir you need to calm down sir
the jury will disregard
what they just saw and heard
mr jackson
proceed with your summation
whosoever shall harm
one of my children
it is better for a millstone to
be hung around his neck
and for him to be cast
into the sea
members of the jury
i ask that the words
of mark 942
remind you
of your responsibility
as they remind me of mine
mr jackson
two days before christmas
willingham committed the
ultimate crime
can there be a more
righteous case
for the imposition
of the ultimate penalty
now whether capital punishment
in this case will deter others
i dont know
but i do know it will deter
cameron todd willingham
and that is what
the state of texas
is asking you to do today
willingham wrote his own
death sentence
when he killed those children
it is your duty to carry it out
sit down boy
only been 40 minutes
liberation could take days

everybody gets the same
amount of ice
except rich folks get it
in the summer
of course you could try to
become a cause célèbre

might even be worth some
publicity
you can get you one of them
fancy pants white shoe boys
willing to do it for free
by the end
who knows if you got enough time
left to make a difference
hold up
inmate what
you saying i can get me
a new lawyer with no money
yeah boy
now you just write up a letter
about your situation and send it
to the texas equal justice
and that should do it
thats initiative
initiativ to the e
tiv to the e
so you say your previous
counsel
failed to capitalize
on numerous opportunities
to reach the prosecutions
witnesses
or to present any viable
alternative
to their theories of your
culpability
he did a shit sorry job
sold you down the river
this is your trial transcript
and just a few books
might be helpful
homework
im preparing
a writ of habeas corpus
also known as the great writ
were allowed to present
new evidence
if we can find some that is
do you have any you know
resources to help us
someone wholl pay
for a private investigator
your wife or family
no sir
all right
well well figure something
out
we need to find something
in your trial
that demonstrates negligence
thats harder to do
once youve been convicted
i need you to go through
the transcript
and find anything questionable
okay can you do that
i think ill squeeze it
into my very hectic schedule
this writ could be your last
chance
and a slim one at that
hey metallica i can
practically hear you reading
give that a rest
let me beat you at crazy eights
this is making my head hurt
they make it that way
on purpose
keep out dummies

contemptuous colloquially
laughs spell that shit
without looking
analogous
did i even say it right
chuckles
meticulous
uhhuh
interwoven
now im gonna drop
some knowledge for you
that first appeal
it might not go nowhere
they aint gonna overturn
their hunting buddys
conviction
you might have a chance
with the fifth circuit
what about this supreme court
shit
you kidding if it leans
any more to the right
itll tip over
these books
keep talking about justice
like its something real
inmate man there aint
no justice in the system

stacy used to say it was like
trying to
grab a hold of two little
greased piggies
at the state fair
oh they was the most beautiful
babies in the whole world
theyre all different
but cut from the same cloth
now kameron she was smart
she had like
a routine that she stuck to
and if anybody disturbed it
and she didnt like it
she would let the whole of texas
know about it
karmen she was
she was more like me
and amber she was a great
big sister
she went from redecorating
her sisters room to
turning around to me one time
and saying daddy
i love the new babies but when
are they going home now
elizabeth chuckles
gosh i tell you
i wanna hear about the world
and i end up doing
all the talking
oh thats fine

how long has it been
eight years
hey

at the end of the line now
you scared todd

elizabeth

i love them more
than i love life itself
door rattles
officer times up
it was weird
he was gentle and soft spoken
oh thats because he wants to
get in your pants
you know thats true
thats rude
and he was a devil worshiper
to boot
no
no
no i heard it right on the tv
he burned up those babies
as a sacrifice to satan himself
elizabeth seriously girls
youre getting out of control
if anybody were to come near
my babies
i got a 38 colt by my bedside
with their name on it
the idea of you
with your loaded 38
makes me wanna move out
of the neighborhood
chuckling indistinct chatter
lets get started
are you gonna use some of this
for your new play as if
oh i dont know
fascinating
liz wha what if somebody
was trying to hurt your babies
id do anything
see
thats not the point
of course it is
its still taking a life
a monster
who dont deserve to live
its just revenge
i mean are we still there
isnt that a primitive idea
no its called restitution
let the punishment
fit the crime
okay well you better kill
your exhusband
oh wouldnt that be great
liz dont become one of those
sad women we hear about
who falls in love with
me
im just saying
thank you so much for
your interest in my love life
but dont worry
even someone as desperate as me
knows that a death row romance
doesnt have a future
chuckling chattering
hey
dad died
crickets chirping
todd dear elizabeth
i didnt get a chance to
express my deep gratitude
for your visit
it lifted my spirits for days
sir
i used to be full of hate
hate for the judge
hate for the jury
hate for everyone
who mistreated
me and wanted me dead
i guess after all this time
the hate just kinda
burned out of me
ive been working hard
on my case and
its funny
im no longer the same dumb
24yearold
who lost his place
in the world
and have achieved more learning
within these walls
than i ever did in school
i can remember every word
of our conversation
youre the kind of person
i never had the chance to meet
an artist
filled with intellectual ideas
and worldly wisdom
for me it was more than
a connection to a world
it brought my heart to laugh
and created an omnipotent glow
around my being
sounds like hes prepping
for the sats
mmhmm well first of all
its omnipotent
and secondly maybe hes just
trying to improve himself
i mean theres other people we
know who might wanna like
study for the sats
im studying
you wanna visit him again
is this like a a thing
i might
why
i dont know honey
you know when you just wanna
do something
help
somebody whos feeling
so much you know

chuckles

best freckles known to man
is he breaking hearts
on the cusp
they get to see their daddy

about your loss
i guess we both know what it is
to lose something now
i wrote a poem about my babies
its pretty bad
you wanna hear it
sure of course
its bad
i know their beauty flows
deep within
and all thats broken
their love will mend
this beauty of theirs
is so unique
its much more valuable
than priceless antiques

fucking terrible huh
laughs
its terrible laughs
man over pa all sections
call count five minutes
clear your ranks
clear the cages
buzzer sounds
youre a cowboys fan right
yeah
you think aikman and irving

you almost done
its fucking freezing out here
figured out why
youre always pissed
yeah whys that
because youre a prisoner here
too like me
you aint bottom of the pile
you aint top of the pile
neither
youre just kinda
middle of the pile
laughs
now in order to feel like
youre going somewhere
in the world
you got to stand on
the likes of me
but dont really get you
anywhere
you just kinda stay
in the middle
yeah
you my fucking therapist now
i just got a lot of time
on my hands is all
you ever read
mans search for meaning
i was absent that day
its by viktor e frankl
okay
yeah the guy basically says
to live is to suffer
and to survive you got to find
meaning in the suffering
i made a promise to my daughter
she visits me sometimes
you got a daughter too right
whats her name again
becky
lets go inside
no need to cuff your bitch ass
are you sure
im feeling dangerous brother
yeah you aint got shit
todd laughs

you still see them
yeah you taking care of them
yeah
you gonna tell them
you saw daddy
you gonna tell them im sorry
you know i didnt do it
dont you
elizabeth well todd
you want to hear
about my life so here goes
you probably didnt want this
much detail
but you did say
you wanted to know everything
mornings are tough
morning
teenagers think
they can stay up all night
then they seemed
surprised when they have
to wake up for school
i probably coddle
them too much
but thats my
right as a mother
well its just me now
i guess i want them to know
im there for them
hey hey didnt you need me
to sign
that signature page
for you
but i tell you
sometimes that hour between
600 and 700 in the morning
feels about five minutes long
lunch is that enough though
yeah
give me a hug
bye mama love you
love you
love you
bye now eat today
most days i try to write
recently not so much
as good as my life is
i cant help think
of all the plans i had
that never happened
i know that sounds spoiled
to someone in your situation
but you said
you want the truth
todd dear elizabeth
i cannot thank you enough
for sharing your thoughts
and feelings with me
i never really looked deeply
into myself
before we started writing
elizabeth dear todd
i got your drawing
that is so beautiful
todd you say you wanna know
what my life is like
well try staying in your
kitchen for an entire day
then think about
what itd be like
to be there
for the rest of your life
regular prisoners talk
about doing time
but on the row
there is no time
the clock stopped moving
the minute we were sentenced
people say
we should all live life
like it could be taken away
at any moment
death catches most people
unawares
youre asleep or your body
shuts down
or an accident happens
but to live every moment
waiting
knowing that they could decide
to kill you at any moment
cant help picturing
the dents on the door
where others have kicked
and fought as they went in
man
are you sure you want this one
its kind of a snooze and jury
was only out for an hour
i got some better ones
just this one please
all right
thanks sir
youre welcome next
woman hey
he wanted to get in so bad
he broke the windows
with a tire iron
but the fire just blew that
glass back at him
ive never seen a man
cry so hard
he didnt try to save those
kids until the cops showed up
and it was like
he was putting on a show
dont surprise me
he started that fire
mr jackson
this socalled art
hung above
todd willinghams bed
dr grigson
what can you tell us about it
in my experience such images
of death and violence
are often associated
with cultive type activities
it is my conclusion
that todd willingham
is a severe sociopath
with violent tendencies
mr jackson is it true
that the police were called
to your home
to control a situation
where todd willingham was
intoxicated
and calling you a
whore bitch and slut
todd would do never do anything
to hurt those babies
he loved those babies
with all his heart
he treated those babies
better than anybody else did
mr horton
no questions your honor
thank you for seeing me
mr horton
well you can thank my girl
ronda
yeah
she told me i had to see you
so you would stop pestering her
oh well i just wanted to get
your thoughts
on todd willingham
so you knew him before
oh yeah
i guess everybody in town
knew him huh
cross the street to stay out
of the way is more like it
nothing but trouble that boy
tell you a little story
night after
todds children died
the whole town had a gathering
to raise money
for their funeral
he acted like
hed just won the lottery
cheering
drinking playing darts
playing and whooping it up
and just because someone acts
inappropriately
doesnt mean theyre a murderer
though right
youre right
whats inappropriate
is taking his part
now you seem like an educated
woman
he had the motive he had the
means the science backed it up
what makes you so cocksure
hes innocent
honestly i dont know
if hes innocent or not
the question is
did he get a fair trial
let me guess
youve seen todd
and he charmed you
he was quite the ladies man
back in corsicana
i wouldnt know anything
about that
but what i do know
is that you failed
to challenge witnesses
that changed their story
you failed to reach out
to todds friends
you failed to find
a single scientific expert
i am sorry sir but
it seems like you barely tried
to create reasonable doubt
in the jurys minds
where did you get your law
degree missy
state didnt give me
enough money
to feed these horses
to defend that boy
but i did the best i could
yeah
yeah and regardless
of your estimation
of my professional abilities
the fact remains
that boy is a monster
and he will die
worry about the living
ms gilbert
yeah well maybe
you should do the same
we clearly have enough
to file an appeal
with the fifth circuit
now im sorry sir
but this horton seems like
a complete loser
i mean he decided
todd was guilty from the getgo
yeah granted todds trial
was a horror show
but it doesnt mean
hes innocent
but then
what about his appeal
ms gilbert
i appreciate your zeal
i worked this case for six
years and got nowhere
theres so many others that
needed my help who i can help
but then what if
they denied him habeas corpus
youre asking the state
to reopen a case
based on character witnesses
when the primary factor
in this conviction
was the arson investigation
now i have to agree with
the experts here ms gilbert
fire does not lie
look youve been kind to him
and i admire that
a personal involvement
can blind you to the truth
ive been there
just dont let your emotions
get the better of you
my emotions what
cause im a woman
sighs thats not what i meant
well then
why dont you enlighten me
have sympathy for the man
hes become
dont forget about
the man he was
great imma go
finish your job for you
hold on a sec
look im sorry
i dont mean to be rude
but its just its been a long
road for me on this one
and i got to let it
go at some point
but you know what
ive been reading this one file
this johnny webb character
and his testimony
seems like a complete lie
i mean is there a way we can
get to him
machine buzzing
hey
hey
machine whirring stops
hey hows it going
are you from one of those
church groups
no uh judge powell called you
right
yeah
yeah ive been
talking to some people
about todd willingham
sounds familiar
yeah you talked to the court
about how he confessed to you
about starting a fire
that killed his daughters
right yeah now i remember
it was sad real sad
yeah ive been reading
your testimony carefully
just wondering how all that
happened
its a long time ago you know
yeah i cant remember
last week
but it sure would help
if theres anything
you could tell me
well uh
i was just sitting in my cell
you know and and this guy
gets put in with me
hes talking for a while and
he confessed to me right there
thats about it
just like that
you felt like you knew
todd well or
like i said
we shared a cell so you know
why do you think
he confessed to you
i guess he just needed to tell
somebody
you know sometimes
a strangers good for that
hows that work
when you testify
in somebody elses case
they um give you
a reduced sentence or
did things change
youre a welder huh
guess so
my dad too
is that what you wanted to do
underwater welder actually
the coolest job
laughs
is that what you are now
i wish
i took a course though
been studying and shit
you know i took it down in
dont tell me houston
houston yeah
at the ocean corporation

they got everything in there
its expensive
yeah you aint kidding
thats far from here too
yeah you know
drove my truck though
this one
yeah yeah thats my baby
now that is thats sweet
almost got it new too
why are you asking me about all
this
how did you pay for this
oh i know what i wanted to
ask you
did jackson
the district attorney
did he promise you
a reduced sentence
for that little story
you told
i dont know i
did he do that to you
i dont know
like promise
to take care of you
they do that
you know i dont wanna
talk no more so
im sorry johnny but
was that the deal
yeah but i aint supposed
to talk about this stuff so
who told you not to talk about
it the district attorney
is asking you not to talk
and theyre using you
its time for you to leave
lady

kill an innocent person
and then you have to
live with it
im done here
theyre gonna kill
an innocent man
and you have to live with it

please
todd he threatened you
that stupid motherfucker
he threatened you
mmhmm listen to me
his story stinks you know why
that guys a snitch
i think the da paid somebody
to pay him off
he took a bribe
mmhmm
oh hes a spineless
piece of shit
but do you understand
what that means
we got a snitch
a gas can that was never found
and stacys testimony
yeah
look at all this evidence
reeve says theres no problem
weve got plenty to go
file an appeal
with the fifth circuit
fifth circuit i already spent
five of my appeals liz
i only got one more left
but you got one more left
its gonna go the same way
as all the others
todd youve got one more
do you think life is fair liz
hell no
do you think god
is all right with that
i dont think we know what his
plan is
i dont even try
to begin to imagine
i wanna live
thats why were not gonna give
up for one second
okay
so life isnt fair
what are we gonna do with that
i mean maybe this right now
is the best we get
us being here for each other
knowing how wrong it all this
maybe this is the god part
all of us down here
trying to figure it all out
thats beautiful baby
is this our house
is that mommy is she crying
she crying because i was
mean to her
is this daddy
daddy was bad huh
im sorry baby
the doctor who testified that
todd was a sociopath
never even met him
andrew that seems unfair
exactly
yeah
they bring him in
whenever they want
a guaranteed death penalty
his nickname is dr death
dr death
he
he was expelled
from the american
psychiatric association
for making diagnosis
without meeting defendants
this is why you read everything
i swear im gonna cook for you
tomorrow night
that is just pitiful
i like cold pizza
i do too but at least
put it on a plate
hey you juls did a dr hurst
call when i was out
nope bye
where you headed
studying
elizabeth with dave
you mean you actually know
his name
what
look
what
i know how amazing it must be
being pen pals
with a murderer
but its like you think
youre some kind of hero
or something
do you even know that andrew
is crying himself to sleep
at night
because he misses daddy
you have no idea
whats going on around here
i do
you dont
thats just not true
im sorry
im sorry sweet pea
man on radio
dallas is now inside the field
goal range on the arizona 37
second down and eight
cowboys come
out of the shotgun
theres a snap
cardinals coming
with the blitz
huntington scrambling left
its picked off again
come on
this time by adrian wilson
what kind of lameass excuse
for a quarterback
throws three interceptions
in the first quarter
laughs hey willingham
cowboys suck
hey shut the fuck up
whoever thought the cowboys
wouldnt make the playoffs
three years in a goddamn row
yeah
it sucks
unbelievable
elizabeth well first of all
we are talking
about a mans life
so now youre spearheading
an effort
to prove todds innocence
well i wouldnt say
spearheading
but i am helping
his lawyer
todds trial was
a complete travesty
man on radio
what a great ball game
hey willingham theyre talking
about you on the radio
hey todd
change the station man
which frequency are we on
its 1060
elizabeth
knew that i was going to
supposedly meet
a killer but
i found myself talking
to a vulnerable sensitive man
he was very easy to talk to
how do you expect to change
peoples minds
who know of todds past
that he beat his wife in front
of multiple witnesses but
elizabeth i mean have you
ever been cruel to someone
in your life
that make you a murderer
no
uh it was very clear
that witness testimony
changed from the time
they talked to the police
to the time they were
in a courtroom
theres new dna
evidence in this case
there may be new fire evidence
there are more questions
to answer here
radio presenter so
what youre telling me is
you believe that
todd is innocent
yes i am
i believe the state of texas
is about to kill
an innocent man
would you wanna
kill an innocent man
there is more than enough
evidence
for todd to be
granted an appeal
if theres any question
hey
evidence or any
your dates been set
february 17th
now i feel excited
i read something on somebody
whos supposed to be like
the world expert on fires
his names hurst
ive got a message to him
and found out
he lives in austin
and i just feel like
thats what we need
you know we need an expert
who can come in
and challenge this absurdity
liz im not here to be saved
well im not
im not a character
in one of your fucking plays
or a pretend boyfriend
or someone here to percolate
some excitement
in your otherwise boring
exfucking housewife life
i am here to die
these are my last days liz
not yours
and i dont need them filled up
with your false hope
now i am grateful for all
the faith youve had in me
all the work everything
but it dont matter
what truth you find now
it aint gonna make
no difference
i lied liz
i lied to you
i lied to everybody
i said i went in straight
to the girls room which i did
crawled over to them
burning shit falling on me
and smoke everywhere
everything was on fire
todd coughing
i tried to get in
but i couldnt
cause it was too hot
todd amber
i already knew that they
todd coughing
sirens wailing
sobbing i was too afraid to
i was too afraid to see my own
kids burning to death
i wanted to go back in
but i couldnt
cause i was too afraid
so i am guilty
any man who cant save his own
kids dont deserve to live
he wants to stop
maybe hes right
maybe were just torturing him
i mean what chance have we got
honestly
doesnt matter how many
think
you think this is just about
todd
system doesnt work
its broken
how many others out there
you think been fucked over
stacy yeah
for a while there
we was crazy in love
and then we got married
after the twins was born and
i thought that meant
he really loved me but
now i think he was just doing it
for them
well stacy if theres anything
you can remember
that we could use to save him
this is it
theyre about to kill him
i know that yeah
please help us

that youre willing to dive in
like this i mean
whats your sign
excuse me
under what sign
of the zodiac were you born
aries
and your horoscope
do you read it
sometimes i guess
sometimes its right
and sometimes its wrong
well all that stuff is just
people have always been
fascinated
by the stars they chartered
their movements
they could tell you
when mercury was retrograde
or when mars was aligned
with venus
they made predictions
based on these observations
these people were called
astrologers
they were the experts
on the solar system
until the science of astronomy
came along
and proved their ideas
to be nothing but bullpucky
ive studied the report
their experts wrote
follow me
move your feet
oh
what do you see
oh
nothing
exactly no burn signature
and no such thing
as crazed glass either
the spider pattern happens
when its hit by cold water
from the fire hoses
glass crackles
ah
i spent two days going over
every detail of this case
thing about investigators
is they tend to find
what theyre looking for
even if it isnt there
theyd already decided
todd was guilty
before they walked
into that house
they were so sure it was arson
they didnt even bother to
check the space heater
whoever installed
the electrical wiring
had never even heard
of a safety code
todd girls
dr hurst those flames
ran up the ceiling
burning the walls
before moving their way down
amber daddy
dr hurst the fire was
what we call a flashover
instant combustion
of everything flammable
the v pattern the experts
found
also a signature of a
flashover
the accelerant on the porch
dr hurst charcoal grill
and lighter fluid
the expert somehow neglected
to mention
my babies are burning up
and the refrigerator
that blocked the back door
linoleum underneath is
untouched
it was always there
never been moved
sighs
my report is based on hundreds
of hours of experiments
by the most rigorous scientists
in the field
these socalled experts
of theirs
may have seen lots of fires
but in the end
theyre just astrologers
thank you mr hurst
thank you so much
theres also just one more thing
that we have to
what we owe you
i dont believe in astrology
ms gilbert
but i do believe in karma
mine can use all the help it can
get the pleasures mine
todd we got hurst
listen to me
we got to hurst
we got to him
he said theres no way
that fire was arson
you know what that means
if theres no arson
theres no crime
can you believe it
no i cant
oh my god
its just like
ive been saying the whole time
well reeves is on his way
to parole board right now
he said theres no way
they wont regard this
as exculpatory evidence
todd we have a real chance
oh i dont know liz
im not fixing to start
hoping again
hope is bad
i got 10 days left
if i start hoping again
them 10 days is gonna go by
just like that
i understand but im hoping

fax machine whirring
woman this fax just came in
from the parole board sir

is always there
if you just
open yourself to it
you helped me to learn to enjoy
the simple blessings
of being alive
i only wish i had something
to give you in return
besides my love always
yours truly todd
okay lets go
presenter governor perry
question about texas
your state has executed
234 death row inmates
more than any other governor
in modern times
have you
cheering and applause
have you struggled
to sleep at night
with the idea that
any one of those
might have been innocent
no sir ive never struggled
with that at all
the state of texas
has a very thoughtful
a very clear
process in place
of which when someone commits
the most heinous of crimes
against our citizens
they get a fair hearing they go
through an appellate process
they go up to the supreme court
of united states
if thats required
but in the state of texas
if you come in to our state
and you kill
one of our children
you kill a police officer
youre involved with
another crime
and you kill
one of our citizens
you will face the ultimate
justice in the state of texas
