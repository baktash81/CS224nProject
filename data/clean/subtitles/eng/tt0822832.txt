debby welcome to our home
marley is a spirited dog
who loves interaction
weve never left him before
but we are sure hell behave
just as he does when were at home
there are just a few things about
marley youre gonna need to know
he eats three times a day
if he looks starved feed him again
now of course all of this food
is gonna have to go somewhere
so use the blue pooper scooper
and watch your step
dont worry about the color
he likes mangoes
marley is not allowed
to drink out of the toilet
so be sure to keep the lid closed
and the brick on the lid
you know actually
you might want
to just keep the bathroom door
shut in general
like most dogs marley
needs a lot of exercise
so try to take him for a walk or a run
every morning and every evening
marley let go
let go let go let go
aaah marley no
and be sure to lock the doors
and windows before you go to sleep
shoo shoo
but dont worry
marley is an excellent watchdog
you can rest easy at night
knowing hes on the job
thunderstorms are his weak point
you can give him sedatives
if you think a storm is arriving
okay here you go marley
marley come back here
he doesnt like them so push them
down his throat as far as they go
welcome welcome
im mrs butterly
now finally we do not allow marley
to get up on any piece of furniture
chew on anything except his toys
other than that enjoy him

so who gets the dog if you guys split up
were not splitting up
out of the realm of possibility
completely
theres nothing she can do no tantrum
too big no depression too deep
no failure to perform wifely duties
that would push you over the edge
why do you jump right to splitting up

is that conor hasnt slept in two weeks
because of that dogs barking
that patrick gets
knocked down twice a day
that i cant even think straight
god forbid theres
a hint of thunder
just dont
just calm down for a second
i know that its been a rough couple of
months with the new baby and everything
i understand that
but i was talking with arnie
and postpartum dep
dont you dare
i am not depressed
i am exhausted
im not angry because of some condition
i cant even go out
for an hour without the kids
because every babysitter in this
neighborhood is terrified of marley
i know that but you were the one that
said you didnt wanna work anymore
we can get help
i dont need any help
that makes it hard
just get rid of the dog
thats not gonna happen obviously
please keep your voice down
me keep my voice down
just do it just get rid of the dog
everybody gets rid of their dogs
its just a dog
and im just a husband you gonna
get rid of me when i misbehave
ive thought about it
well that makes two of us
what do you have to complain about
what do i
because youre such a joy to be around
youre such a jerk
so nice to walk in the door
feel like youre joining a chain gang
just a jerk

honey im sorry
i just got overwhelmed
no one tells you how hard this is all gonna be
which part
all of it
marriage being a parent
its the hardest job in the world
and nobody prepares you for that
nobody tells you how much
you have to give up
i feel like they do tell you
but you dont listen
or you think ah theyre just miserable
ive given up so much
of what made me who i am
but i cant say that because
im a very bad person if i say that
but i feel it i really do
i feel it sometimes i just
i just want you to know that
i do know that
and you can say it i say it
but i did make a choice
i made a choice and even
if its harder than i thought
i dont regret it
are you sure
i am very sure
cause it kinda has like a
theres no place like home feeling to it
i just think these things are gonna happen
and were gonna get through them
and well just do it together
together
getting rid of marley is not gonna fix anything
no
and getting rid of you
isnt gonna fix anything either
can i ask you a favor
yes

im glad to see a little blood
flowing from these people

theres a recurring theme here
recurring theme is we got a lot
of cranks in broward county
thats what im up against
but what im trying to say with all due respect
is that you are one of them
im a commentator
everyone wants me to act
like everythings great
when there are issues
theres overcrowding theres crime
theres racial tensions
every time you turn around theres a new
sky rise going up even uglier than the one
that goes on all over the world
its not florida its you whats wrong

oh hes turning 40 hes become a curmudgeon
thats not it maybe
i dont know maybe im sick of my column

for gods sakes
maybe a regional treasure
well a municipal treasure for sure

he seems okay
for now hes good
the problem is that once this happens
it almost always happens again
and if it does i dont know what
im gonna be able to do for him
hes an older dog i honestly dont think
he would survive the surgery
well we have to make sure
that doesnt happen again
well most likely
it is gonna happen again
well we also talked about that maybe
he ate too fast or drank too quickly
right
so maybe it doesnt have to happen again
well monitor that
im just saying you may wanna prepare yourself
that he may not make it through the night
maybe 10 of dogs
survive this kind of a thing
whatwhat is that number based on
what is it based on
yeah the reason why i ask
is i bet that numbers
based on regular dogs
regular dogs
yeah and this guy here is not like other dogs
i know people probably say that
all the time but to be honest
im not sure he really is a dog
he once ate an answering machine
just polished it off
he didnt chew it he ate it and then digested
it then went and had the phone for dessert
another time my son had colic and
this guy sat up all night didnt move
just stayed right there for nine hours
just keeping an eye on conor
so i think maybe that
the number applies to regular dogs
but not to him
well you got a fighter here
lets hope for the best
i know hes gonna be okay
ill see you in the morning
oh hi
hey
theyre gonnatheyre gonna
keep him overnight
but he seemed better when i left
the vet really seemed on top of it

bye clearance puppy
a dog has no use for fancy cars
or big homes or designer clothes
a waterlogged stick
will do just fine
a dog doesnt care
if youre rich or poor
clever or dull smart or dumb
give em your heart
and hell give you his
how many people
