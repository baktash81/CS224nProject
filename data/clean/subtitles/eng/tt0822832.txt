well  no  it s just  i don t even read
this crap when other people write it

inspiration  but it s not for a column

look at marley 
now he s eating the floor 
marley  stop 
marley  you re incorrigible 
incorrigible  i don t believe in that word 
every dog wants to learn 
hey  come here  baby

a dog can only have one master 
which one of you has the most natural
authority in your own relationship 
well  maybe i ll stand
over there for the beginning 
i thought so  shall we 
  geez 
  all right  sit 
sit  sit 
  sit  marley 
okay  marley  marley  sit 
this  class  is a classic example of a dog   
who has foolishly been
allowed to believe   
he is the alpha male of the pack   
and therefore  he can never be a happy animal 
yeah  he looks pretty miserable 
you  joker  rotate in 
and lose the sunglasses 
dog likes to be
looked at in the eye 
  jawohl 
  i got it 
  okay 
  okay  you got him 
  yeah

  whoa 
  rein in that dog 
all right  all right  class

of having confidence   
in your own authority

likes to obey his leader 
marley  heel

marley  marley 
marley 
careful  marley  no 
  marley 
aaah  that s it  he is out 
sorry  usually he does this with poodles 
that dog is a bad influence on the others 
now  leg humping is like a virus 
once it takes hold of the group  no 
  okay 
  he has got to go 
it was maybe your hair 
  reminded him of a poodle 
  never bring him back 
right from the beginning
she had me in her sights 
  i know  she really did 
  marley wouldn t take any of her crap 
that s why he got kicked out 
you are now the world s worst dog

 cause you know it s a lie 
poor son of a bitch 
okay  you wanna come up 
yeah  that s the least i can do 
  marley 
  get a little fresh air 
oh  gosh  it s like he s
walking the plank 
i mean  that s what
breaks my heart  is he s so happy 
  he doesn t know what s coming 
  honey  he s gonna be fine 
  oh  no  no  no  that makes me nervous 
  he s okay 
he s just getting a little air

you got him  careful  careful 
this is a rough draft   cause i d like
to take another pass at it 
you know  the beginning 
i think i might want 
i think we can maybe lose that 
 cause i think it gets a little bit  jokey  
i just reread it  and i didn t think
it really worked at all  i m sorry 
  i m gonna go back and do the zoning piece 
  wait  wait a minute 
what are you apologizing for 
this stuff is hysterical

okay  so what s next 
um  ice cream 
no  i mean on your list 
  my list 
  jen  the list 
your little play list that you had when
we got married that had the game plan 
  it was basically my marching orders 
  my plan 
your plan  i wanna know
what s next  scare me 
  you really wanna know 
  hit me 
  well  it s a toss up between the new roof 
  very practical 
and  uh  and a baby 
i could live with a few leaks 
  really 
  yeah  a couple 
but you know  a couple leaks
turn into maybe one big leak   
and then that big leak becomes
a very big responsibility 
  that s true 
  we may want to think
about fixing a lot of things   
  before we start 
  well  honey  we already fixed marley 
if we fix too many more things  then
i think this conversation becomes moot 
john  are you serious 
yeah  yeah  i think so 
  you realize we re not talking
about an actual roof here 
  yes 
i got that  about halfway
through i picked it up 
good metaphor though 
and you re not just saying this  cause
you think it ll lead to some funny columns 
honey  come on  i mean 
if i get some funny columns   
that s collateral damage
i think we can live with 
i mean  i m ready    if you are 
well  instead of trying
to have a baby   
why don t just stop
trying not to have one 
  okay  if i m following you
correctly  and i think i am 
  uh huh 
this is the part we head back 
we take it off  we get it on 
yes  but you ll  it ll have a little
more romance than that 
  yeah  we ll get some candles 
some sade of course 
  sade 
  honey 
  yeah 
did you have kibble today 
marley  come on  marley  go 
honey  he s a dog

on the growth   
of the domestic drug trade
for the times magazine

  yeah  i would love that 
of course  it will be
a lot of work  a lot of travel 
i would hope so

no  no  don t let him do that 
sorry  sorry 
all you have to do is 
you just knee him if he does that 
that shouldn t happen all the time 
just when you walk through the door 
but here  read this  this ll tell you
everything you need to know 
  i ve got the bags here 
  have you got everything 
  thank you  come on  honey 
  can you get that door 
  i got it 
  okay  here we are 
  honey  we re really late 
  oh  marley  marley 
debby  welcome to our home 
marley is a spirited dog
who loves interaction 
we ve never left him before 
but we are sure he ll behave   
just as he does when we re at home 
there are just a few things about
marley you re gonna need to know 
  he eats three times a day 
if he looks starved  feed him again 
now  of course  all of this food
is gonna have to go somewhere   
so use the blue pooper scooper 
and watch your step 
don t worry about the color 
he likes mangoes 
marley is not allowed
to drink out of the toilet   
so be sure to keep the lid closed   
  and the brick on the lid 
you know  actually 
you might want   
to just keep the bathroom door
shut in general 
like most dogs  marley
needs a lot of exercise   
so try to take him for a walk or a run
every morning and every evening 
marley  let go 
let go  let go  let go 
aaah  marley  no 
and be sure to lock the doors
and windows before you go to sleep 
shoo  shoo 
but don t worry 
marley is an excellent watchdog 
you can rest easy at night
knowing he s on the job 
thunderstorms are his weak point 
you can give him sedatives
if you think a storm is arriving 
okay  here you go  marley 
marley  come back here 
he doesn t like them  so push them
down his throat as far as they go 
welcome  welcome 
i m mrs  butterly 
now finally  we do not allow marley
to get up on any piece of furniture   
chew on anything except his toys 
other than that  enjoy him 
love  jenny and john

  we re not splitting up 
  out of the realm of possibility 
  completely 
there s nothing she can do  no tantrum
too big  no depression too deep 
no failure to perform wifely duties
that would push you over the edge 
why do you jump right to splitting up

i can t even go out
for an hour without the kids   
because every babysitter in this
neighborhood is terrified of marley 
i know that  but you were the one that
said you didn t wanna work anymore 
  we can get help 
  i don t need any help 
  that makes it hard 
  just get rid of the dog 
  that s not gonna happen obviously 
  please keep your voice down 
  me keep my voice down 
  just do it  just get rid of the dog 
everybody gets rid of their dogs 
it s just a dog 
and i m just a husband  you gonna
get rid of me when i misbehave 
  i ve thought about it 
  well  that makes two of us 
  what do you have to complain about 
  what do i 
  because you re such a joy to be around 
  you re such a jerk 
so nice to walk in the door 
feel like you re joining a chain gang 
just a jerk 
stop it  it s your fault 
  you gotta be kidding me

till things cool down at home 
a couple days will be all right 
you guys know each other 
you ll be comfortable

just until i can find
a more permanent home 
  this is his permanent home  john 
  mmm 
marley s not going anywhere 
honey  i m sorry 
i just got overwhelmed 
  no one tells you how hard this is all gonna be 
  which part 
all of it 
marriage  being a parent 
it s the hardest job in the world
and nobody prepares you for that 
nobody tells you how much
you have to give up 
i feel like they do tell you 
but you don t listen   
or you think   ah  they re just miserable  
i ve given up so much
of what made me who i am 
but i can t say that because   
i m a very bad person if i say that 
but i feel it  i really do 
i feel it sometimes  i just 
i just want you to know that 
i do know that 
and you can say it  i say it 
but i did make a choice 
i made a choice  and even
if it s harder than i thought   
i don t regret it 
  are you sure 
  i am very sure 
 cause it kinda has like a
 there s no place like home  feeling to it 
i just think these things are gonna happen
and we re gonna get through them 
  and we ll just do it together 
  together 
  getting rid of marley is not gonna fix anything 
  no 
and getting rid of you
isn t gonna fix anything either 
  can i ask you a favor 
  yes 
no more kids for a while 
absolutely  deal 
hi  guys

  gil lawford from the philadelphia inquirer 
  uh  yeah  yeah 
hi  how are you 
thanks for getting back to me 
oh  hey  who was that on the phone 
the philadelphia inquirer 
i sent the editor some clips
a while back and he wants to meet 
  what s a while back 
  he was down here on vacation a month ago 
and he read my stuff 
and we kind of had lunch 
  how do you kind of have lunch 
  i didn t think anything was gonna come of it 
okay 
  but 
  they offered me a job 
i mean  i have an interview 
  as  like  a columnist or 
  as a reporter 
as a reporter 
well  what did you say 
i said   thank you very much 
but i m happy here   
  never have i heard someone
piss and moan as much as john grogan 
if he doesn t like it here 
he should move  
that s part of my job
is to get a response 
  i m glad to see a little blood
flowing from these people 
  no 
  there s a recurring theme here 
  recurring theme is we got a lot
of cranks in broward county 
  that s what i m up against 
  but what i m trying to say  with all due respect   
is that you are one of them 
i m a commentator 
everyone wants me to act   
like everything s great 
when there are issues 
there s overcrowding  there s crime 
there s racial tensions 
every time you turn around there s a new
sky rise going up even uglier than the one 
that goes on all over the world 
it s not florida  it s you  what s wrong 
nothing s wrong  everyone wants to think 
 oh  he s turning 40  he s become a curmudgeon  
that s not it  maybe 
i don t know  maybe i m sick of my column 
i don t  i don t find the things
i m saying that interesting 
john  john  you re the comic voice
of south florida 
you re a national treasure 
for god s sakes 
  maybe a regional treasure 
  well  a municipal treasure for sure 
  thank you 
  listen  take a vacation 
go away for a couple weeks 
  take a month off 
  go where 
  i don t know 
  i live in a vacation spot 
then go to someplace where it s painful and sad 
oh  40 s gonna be tough  buddy 
i m not gonna lie to you 
but we knew that 
we knew this was when
father time was gonna make his move 
try to take us down a dark alley
and beat the hell out of us 
you got a little more
white around the temple   
but makes you look
more distinguished  i think 
we both lost a step 
i know 
how does it feel to have
your best years behind you 
you do everything you wanted to 
no  me neither 
all right  you hot 
you wanna cool off  let s do it 
you know what  not today 
you ve been on a leash
a little too long

of a second wind

something in my liberty
oh  my  my
happiness  coming and going

watch my fever growing
i know just where i am

piece of advice i ever gave you was a lot of crap

a mushy guy would tell you he s proud of you 
give you a hug and send you on your way

  door s always open

hut

okay 
  come on 
  what s wrong with him  dad 
nothing s wrong 
he s just    tired  right  dad 
yeah  the football
took it out of him 
let s go 
i don t know  i just don t understand 
a year ago  you couldn t wait
to be done with your column 
i know  but now i got this guy going through
every sentence with a fine tooth comb 
i gotta admit  sometimes i miss
the freedom where i could just 
  what 
  it s just  it s exhausting sometimes  john 
you always wanting something
that you don t have 
are you happy 
i mean  none of this
was part of the plan 
no  no  it wasn t part of the plan 
but it s so much better 
i m just sort of done making plans 
marley  oh  gross 
hmm  seems like somebody
needs to go out  whoo 
all right  marley 
come on  come on  boy 
oh  come on 
now it s really coming down 
marley  marley 
where d he go  marley 
  what s going on 
  i don t know 
  he s not coming back 
  marley 
well  he couldn t have gone far  marley 
i ll come with you  hold on 
  marley  i don t know where he could have gone 
  marley 
well  maybe he went
next door again in the barn 
  i ll check in the woodshed 
  okay 
marley 
marley 
marley  oh  marley 
  did you see anything 
  no  nothing 
  i gotta go talk to them 
  okay 
wow  it s pouring out there 
  did you find him 
  you know what 
he s out exploring 
you know how he loves the woods 
bobby says dogs  when they re
gonna die  they go away to do it 
that s what his beagle did 
mmm  well  you know 
that s true for beagles 
but  uh  not labs like marley 
he s just out causing trouble 
don t worry 
okay  now  you finished
with your homework 
  yep 
  nope 
nope  well  let s make that a  yep  
come on now 
marley  marley 
marley 
marley 
marley  ah  marley  you okay 
stay there 
why did his stomach twist  we don t
exactly know why this happens 
most likely he ate or drank something
quickly and his stomach just flipped 
i did manage to get a tube
down there to relieve some of the gas 
  i think i untwisted it 
  he seems okay 
for now  he s good 
the problem is that once this happens 
it almost always happens again 
and if it does  i don t know what
i m gonna be able to do for him 
he s an older dog  i honestly don t think
he would survive the surgery 
well  we have to make sure
that doesn t happen again 
well  most likely 
it is gonna happen again 
well  we also talked about that maybe
he ate too fast or drank too quickly 
  right 
  so maybe it doesn t have to happen again 
we ll monitor that 
i m just saying you may wanna prepare yourself
that he may not make it through the night 
maybe 10   of dogs
survive this kind of a thing 
what what is that number based on 
  what is it based on 
  yeah  the reason why i ask   
is i bet that number s
based on regular dogs 
  regular dogs 
  yeah  and this guy here is not like other dogs 
i know people probably say that
all the time  but to be honest   
i m not sure he really is a dog 
he once ate an answering machine 
just polished it off 
he didn t chew it  he ate it  and then digested
it  then went and had the phone for dessert 
another time  my son had colic and
this guy sat up all night  didn t move   
just stayed right there for nine hours
just keeping an eye on conor 
so i think maybe that
the number applies to regular dogs 
  but not to him 
  well  you got a fighter here 
let s hope for the best 
i know he s gonna be okay 
i ll see you in the morning 
  oh  hi 
  hey 
they re gonna they re gonna
keep him overnight 
but he seemed better when i left 
the vet really seemed on top of it 
  are you okay 
  yeah  what are you reading 
i m reading your old columns 
marley s in so many of them 
you still look at those 
yeah  i do sometimes 
even on the crappiest days 
the kids are driving me nuts 
laundry s not done   
and a hundred other things are wrong 
i always know that i have this 
it s five minutes of you 
sometimes they re sad
and sometimes they re really funny   
silly or whatever 
but  but they re all you 
and for those five minutes   
you make me feel better 
you should read them 
they re pretty great 
might even make a nice book 
  a book 
  something 
hello 
all right  thank you 
he s coming home 
is he there 
of course he s there 
he s always there 
  how does he know we re coming 
  i don t know  he just knows

colleen  she arrived after you left 
  what s with the ladybug getup 
  that was for her school play in preschool 
and then we couldn t get her out of
her costume for  like  a month afterwards 
and the reason why marley
looks like he s biting her head   
is because the antennas on it 
he went ballistic 
  things don t change 
  that s right 
  i wish i didn t have this interview 
  that s okay  i gotta get home 
conor s got a soccer game 
all right  well  one of these days
