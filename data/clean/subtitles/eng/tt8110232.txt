a lasting impression on her life 
my first child came easy enough 
but with patricia they had to open me up
under anesthesia 
i ve often thought that perhaps
the reason   
i told them when i got here 
 okay  i explored the criminal lifestyle

for christ s sake 
moltisanti is a religious name 
and still i m fucked 
i met death on route 23

if i was home i d have given him
a schiaff he d never forget 
what s he want to be when he gets older 
thinks he s gonna be a football player 
he s good 
i don t think he s pro material 
  what do you think  dick 
  probably not 
but who knows  he puts on a few pounds 
four years of college ball   
he should go to work for my cousin frank
in the patio furniture business 
here we go with that tune 
so maybe he s not a ball player  but li 
you don t wanna step on the kid s dream 
you always take his side 
look  you give him
the best advice you can 
you lead by example 
he ll make the right decision 
  this kid s got what it takes 
  that s what i m saying 
we all do things like that
when we re kids  right 
beat up the mister softee man 
if my christopher grew up to be like tony 
i d be goddamn proud of him 
i told him the other day  i said 
 you play football for a career 
it doesn t last long 
you wind up an old crippled man
by the time you re 32  
bobby piocosta  he s a junior 
on anthony s team 
he fractured his shoulder last week 
the mother was hysterical 
they had to take him
to a specialist at st  barnabas 
you think the school s gonna pay for that 
that s some christmas present  huh 
having your kid laid up 
he can t help outside 
hang the decorations 
he can t help shovel the walk   
don t give me that look  hm 
i thought it will be different 
what 
make love with a black man

if you feed them 
oh

i d stack my bread if you were my girl 
you want to have your own beauty parlor

thatjinxes it for me 
see  the law of averages say you got
the same chance of hitting
as any two random people 
yeah  but two people at the same time
don t have the same chance of winning 
that s the law of averages 
that s a fallacy  ms  johnson 
it s all random

come on  all right  dickie 
go get it 
that fall  johnny moved
to the suburbs  the black thing

this move made tony half a pussy 
in my estimation 
what made you think
it was a good idea
to steal the answers to the geometry test 
i didn t study  and  uh  i needed to pass 
so i could stay on the football team 
you know  you got charlie nodzak
in trouble  too 
when you paid him for the answers 
well  he was the only kid i knew
on the mimeo squad 
well  charlie was on the honor roll 
and you re missing the point 
you know stealing the test was wrong 
yeah  i guess so 
but if you re gonna kick me out of school 
i mean  you should just do it 
instead of us talking about it 
you talk a lot at home 
i don t know

the stanford binet  he s high iq 
  but you know that 
  you can t prove it by me 
he s got a d plus average 
well  that s because
he doesn t apply himself

 enthusiastic  insightful  playful  
ah  you re talking through your hat

you read to him from that book 
long into the night  apparently 
he remembered details 
he didn t know the word  ingot

best memories of his life
