 wind howling 
 rustling continues 
 screams 
do you know  jane eyre 
where the wicked
go after death 
they go to hell 
and what is hell 
a pit full of fire 
should you like
to fall into this pit
and be burned
there forever 
no  sir 
how might
you avoid it 
i must keep in good
health and not die 
 sighs 
what is her parentage 
she s an orphan 
her mother was
my husband s sister 
on his deathbed
he exhorted me
to care for her 
i have always treated her
as one of my own 
if you accept her
at lowood school 
mr  brocklehurst 
keep a strict eye on her 
she has a heart of spite 
and i m sorry to say
that her worst fault
is that of deceit 
brocklehurst 
you can rest assured
that we shall root out
the wickedness
in this small 
ungrateful plant 
mrs  reed  and as
for its vacations 
it must spend them
all at lowood 
 bell ringing

you  and i don t 
i dislike you worse

with an inseparable
band of love 
for thou 
even thou alone 
dost satisfy him
that loveth thee 
and without thee 
all things are vain
and empty 
amen 
all  amen 
it s wonderful to see
you up  miss elliott 
last week we thought
we d be escorting your remains
to an unmarked grave 
diana   chuckles  she read
the bride of lindorf
and suddenly it s all
woebegone maidens
and dramatic deaths 
jane  i m sorry to have
caused so much trouble 
diana  nonsense 
mary  you re the
most exciting thing
that s happened here
since st  john s
sermon on the
fall of babylon 
jane  i hope i ll not

expense  mr  rivers 
then tell me where

 gasping 
was it a thorough education 
most thorough 
teacher  a little wit   
girls  a little wit   
   will serve   
   a fortunate man

   a fortunate man 
burns 
i will not have you
before me in that attitude 
all rise 
i see you are mortifying
this girl s flesh 
sir  she was not   
it is your mission
to render her contrite
and self denying 
continue 
 helen groans 
 tray shattering 
the new girl 
this is the pedestal
of infamy 
and you will remain
upon it all day long 
you will have neither
food nor drink 
for you must learn
how barren is the
life of a sinner 
children  i exhort you
to shun her  exclude her 
shut her out
from this day forth 
withhold the hand
of friendship
and deny your love
to jane eyre 
the liar 
how do you bear
being struck 
miss scatcherd hits me
to improve me 
she s tormented
by my faults 
if she hit me 
i d get that birch
and break it
under her nose 
she d find another
soon enough 
my father used to preach
that life s too short
to spend in nursing
animosity 
at my aunt s house 
i was solitary
and despised 
she thought i could do
without one bit of
love or kindness 
you are loved 
there s an invisible world
all around you 
a kingdom of spirits
commissioned to
guard you  jane 
do you not see them 
jane 
have you something
for me to do 
you re doing
something already 
may i see 
these are wonderful 
st  john   
no  mary  please   
see how skilled jane is 
is this how
you perceive me 
miss elliott 
well  how fierce i am 
jane 
you re freezing 
your little feet are bare 
come into bed
and cover yourself 
 coughing 
how are you 
i m happy  jane 
i m going home 
back to your father 
i m going to god 
don t be sad 
you have a passion
for living  jane 
and one day you ll
come to the region of bliss 
don t leave me 
i like to have you near 
i will not leave you 
no one shall
take me from you 
 coughs

helen 
 carriage rolling away 
mr  rivers  i wondered
if you had yet heard
of any work i could do 
i found you a situation
some time ago 
but i ve delayed telling you
because the work is lowly
and i fear you ll scorn it 
i shan t mind what i do 
when i took over
the parish two years ago 
it had no school 
i opened one for boys 
i now intend to
open one for girls 
the schoolmistress
will have a cottage paid
for by benefactors
and she ll receive
 15 a year 
you can see how humble 
how ignoble it is 
mr  rivers 
thank you 
i accept 
with all my heart 
but you comprehend me 
 tis a village school 
cottagers  daughters 
what will you do
with all your fine
accomplishments 
i will save them
till they re wanted 
they will keep 
rochester  jane 
you will be quite
alone here 
i m not afraid
of solitude 
this is my first home
where i am neither dependent
nor subordinate to anyone 
thank you  mr  st  john 
it is small and plain 
as i told you 
then it ll suit me
very well 
girl  safe journey

driver  thornfield  miss 
wait here  miss 
 door opening 
how do you do 
my dear 
are you mrs  fairfax 
indeed i am 
what a tedious journey
you must have had 
your hands must
be frozen  here 
goodness 
how young you are 
i m quite experienced 
i can assure you 
of course you are 
i m sure we re very
lucky to have you 
leah  would you
ask martha to bring
a little hot port
and cut a sandwich or two 
draw nearer the fire 
john is taking your trunk
up to your room 
i ve put you at the
back of the house 
i hope you don t mind 
the rooms at the
front have much
finer furniture 
but they re so gloomy
and solitary  i think 
i m glad you re come 
to be sure  this is
a grand old house 
but i must confess that
in winter one can feel
a little dreary and alone 
leah s a very nice girl 
and john and martha
are good people  too 
but they are servants 
one cannot talk to them
on terms of equality 
jane  am i meeting
miss fairfax tonight 
who 
miss fairfax 
my pupil 
oh  you mean miss varens 
mr  rochester s ward 
she s to be your pupil 
who s mr  rochester 
why  the owner of thornfield 
mr  edward fairfax rochester 
i thought thornfield hall
belonged to you 
bless you  child 
what an idea  me 
i m only the housekeeper 
forgive me 
there is a distant
connection between
mr  rochester and me 
his mother was a fairfax 
but i d never presume on it 
heavens  me 
owner of thornfield 
we shall have a cheerful
house this winter 
with miss varens
here and with you 
we ll have quite
a merry time of it 
i m sure that last winter 
and what a severe one it was 
if it didn t rain it snowed 
if it didn t snow it blew 
i declare  not one soul
came to the house from
november to february 
when spring finally came 
i thought it a great relief
i hadn t gone distracted 
 laughing 
i ve had martha lay a fire 
i hope you ll be comfortable 
 faint chattering 
gardener  now  get that lot
turned over before
frost comes down 
boy  do you want
the upper bit doing
as well 
yes 
mrs  fairfax 
we must open the
window in the study today
to let in some air 
i ve never seen such
an ancient old house 
how beautifully
you ve preserved it 
well  mr  rochester s visits
are always unexpected 
he doesn t like
to arrive and find
everything all swathed up 
so i keep it in
constant readiness 
now  come and
meet miss varens 
did i mention
she s french 
 speaking french 
will you ask her
about her parents 
mr  rochester
neglected to tell me
anything about her 
 speaking french 
her mother
has passed away 
 gasps 
adèle is going to show us
her accomplishments 
oh 
 singing french song 
how very french 
 speaks french 
very good 
very good 
now  we re going
to make a press 
shut the book up 
butterfly 
and what was it
before it was a butterfly 
caterpillar 
 i shall leave
and walk into town  
 gasps   do not go  
begged her maid 
 the gytrash roams
these hills  
 speaks french 
a spirit of the north
that lies in wait
for travelers 
it tenants the
carcasses of beasts 
possesses horses 
wolves  great dogs 
you know it
only by its eyes 
which burn as
red as coals 
and if one should
chance upon you   
 speaking french 
nothing  a mere story 
 speaking french 
what nonsense 
mrs  fairfax 
whatever brings
you up here 
i ve been waiting
to pour our tea 
i m not in need of tea 
thank you 
it s a quiet life 
isn t it 
this isolated house 
a still doom for
a young woman 
i wish a woman could
have action in her life 
like a man 
it agitates me to pain
that the skyline over
there is ever our limit 
i long sometimes
for a power of vision
that would overpass it 
if i could behold
all i imagine   
i ve never seen a city 
i ve never
spoken with men 
and i fear my
whole life will pass   
now  exercise
and fresh air 
great cures for
anything  they say 
i have some letters to post 
will you take them 
 panting 
 wood creaking 
 horse neighing 
up  up  you
cursed beast  up 
 groaning 
stand back 
are you injured  sir 
may i be of some help 
where did you
come from 
just below 
at thornfield hall 
i am the governess 
i m on my way
to post a letter 
can i fetch
someone to help 
the governess 
you may help me yourself 
get hold of his bridle
and lead him to me 
if you would be so kind 
 neighing 
it would be easier
to bring me to the horse 
come here 
i must beg of you
to please come here 
miss governess 
hold it 
make haste
with your letter 
for who knows
what might lurk in
these dark woods 
mrs  fairfax  leah 
go and light the fire in
the master s bedroom 
and tell martha
to prepare for tea 
leah  yes  ma am 
mr  rochester s here 
go and change your frock 
he wishes to meet you 
leah  take her cloak 
i have to change 
i always dress for
the evening when
mr  rochester s here 
but all my dresses
are the same 
you must have
one that s better 
he s in a terrible humor 
his horse fell
in hay lane  and
his ankle is sprained 
he s at the doctor
this half hour 
where have you been 
 speaking french 
rochester  let her sit 
i ve examined adèle
and i find you ve taken
great pains with her 
she s not bright 
she has no talents 
yet in a short time
she s improved 
thank you  mr  rochester 
you ve been resident
here three months 
yes  sir 
and from whence
do you hail 
what s your tale of woe 
pardon 
all governesses
have a tale of woe 
what s yours 
i was brought up by my aunt 
mrs  reed of gateshead 
in a house even
finer than this 
i then attended
lowood school 
where i received
as good an education
as i could hope for 
i have no tale
of woe  sir 
where are your parents 
dead 
do you remember them 
no 
and why are you
not with mrs  reed
of gateshead now 
she cast me off  sir 
why 
because i was burdensome
and she disliked me 
no tale of woe 
mrs  fairfax 
i daily thank providence
for sending us miss eyre 
she s an invaluable   
don t trouble yourself to
give her a character 
i ll judge for myself 
i have her to thank
for this sprain 
sir 
you bewitched my horse 
i did not 
were you waiting
for your people
on that lane 
i have no people  sir 
i mean for the imps
and elves and little
green men 
the sad truth is 
they are all gone 
your land is neither wild
nor savage enough for them 
adèle brought me these 
are they yours 
yes  sir 
where did you
get your copies 
out of my head 
that head i now see
on your shoulders 
yes  sir 
who s this 
the evening star 
were you happy when
you painted these 
yes 
to paint is one of
the keenest pleasures
i have ever known 
then your pleasures
have been few 
are you satisfied
with them 
far from it 
i imagine things i m
powerless to execute 
you ve secured the
shadow of your thoughts 
yet the drawings
are  for a schoolgirl 
peculiar 
good night 
jane  come  adèle 
most merciful father 
we give thee humble
thanks for this 
thy special bounty 
amen 
amen 
amen 
 faint piano music 
sit nicely  please  adèle 
 piano lid closing 
rochester  pilot 
 door slamming 
 pilot barking 
rochester   shouting 
pilot  come here 
 gunshots 
rochester  go on 
further down 
rochester  by the river 
he s very abrupt
and changeful 
what manner
of man is he 
he s a good master 
he s fine company 
too  when he   
 gunshots 
except when he s
in an ill humor 
adèle 
rochester  i hate to reload 
 gunshot 
 rochester grunts 
 adèle speaks french 
 laughing 
on three 
one  two  three 
ready 
oh 
think that s it  sir 
take it down to the river 
come on 
 playing piano 
keep it 
 speaking french 
take it away and
disembowel it 
beautiful 
miss eyre 
i m not fond
of children 
nor do i particularly enjoy
simple minded old ladies 
but you might suit me 
if you would 
how  sir 
by distracting me
from the mire of
my thoughts 
 speaking french 
that is how maman
used to say 
precisely 
and that s
how she charmed
my english gold
out of my english pocket 
mrs  fairfax 
let s go and try it on 
shall we 
 sighing 
your gaze is very
direct  miss eyre 
do you think me handsome 
no  sir 
what fault do
you find with me 
i have all my limbs
and features 
i beg your pardon  sir 
i ought to have replied
that beauty is of
little consequence 
you re blushing  miss eyre 
and though
you re not pretty any more
than i am handsome 
i must say it becomes you 
and now i see
you re fascinated by
the flowers on the rug 
come  speak to me 
fact is  miss eyre 
i d like to draw you out 
you have rather
the look of another
world about you 
i don t wish to treat
you as inferior 
yet you d command
me to speak 
are you very hurt by
my tone of command 
there are few masters
who d trouble to enquire
whether their paid
subordinates
were hurt by their commands 
paid subordinate 
i d forgotten the salary 
well  on that
mercenary ground 
will you consent
to speak as my equal
without thinking that
the request arises
from insolence 
i d never mistake
informality for
insolence  sir 
one  i rather like 
the other  nothing freeborn
should ever submit to 
humbug 
even for a salary 
most free born things
would submit to
anything for a salary 
but i mentally shake
hands with you
for your answer 
not three in 3 000
schoolgirl governesses
would have answered me
as you ve just done 
then you ve not
spent much time in
our company  sir 
i m the same plain kind
of bird as all the rest 
with my common tale of woe 
i envy you 
how 
your openness 
your unpolluted mind 
when i was your age 
fate dealt me a blow 
and since happiness
is denied me 
i ve a right to get
pleasure in its stead 
and i will get it 
cost what it may 
then you ll degenerate
still more 
but  miss eyre 
if the pleasure
i was seeking was
sweet and fresh 
if it was an inspiration 
if it wore the robes of
an angel of light 
what then 
to speak truth  sir 
i don t understand you at all 
i fear the conversation
has got out of my depth 
you re afraid of me 
i m not afraid 
i ve simply no wish
to talk nonsense 
 laughs 
 sighs 
do you never laugh 
miss eyre 
only rarely  perhaps 
but you re not
naturally austere 
any more than
i m naturally vicious 
i can see in you
the glance of a
curious sort of bird
through the close set
bars of a cage 
a vivid  restless captive 
were it but free 
it would soar  cloud high 
 door opening 
mrs  fairfax  leah 
have you seen mrs  poole 
leah  yes  ma am 
the master s in no mood
for any more mistakes 
 woman laughing 
who s there 
 faint thud 
 louder thud 
 coughing 
wake up  sir 
wake up  sir 
wake up 
 hissing 
the quilt 
give it here 
 coughing 
 rochester grunting 
a noise aroused me
from my sleep 
what noise 
there was someone
at my door 
stay here 
don t make a sound 
 ticking 
say nothing about this 
you re no talking fool 
but   
i ll account for
this state of affairs 
say nothing 
yes  sir 
is that how you
would leave me 
jane  fire is
a horrible death 
you ve saved my life 
don t walk past me
as if we were strangers 
but what am i to do then 
i ve a pleasure in
owing you my life 
there is no debt 
i knew you would do me
good in some way 
i saw it in your eyes
when i first beheld you 
their expression did
not strike my very inmost
being so for nothing 
people talk of natural
sympathies  you   
 whispering 
good night then  sir 
you will leave me  then 
i am cold 
go 
 birds chirping 
has mr  rochester
not sent for us today 
why  he s gone away 
were you not aware 
he left after breakfast 
he s gone to the leas 
it s mr  eshton s place 
i believe blanche
ingram is there 
she s a great
favorite of his 
i saw her two years
ago when mr  rochester
gave a party here 
she s a most
elegant girl 
they sang a duet together 
they made a lovely harmony 
i was quite surprised
he didn t make a proposal 
but she has no fortune 
in every other way
they d make
a splendid match 
perhaps it s his
intention now 
he s far more likely to
have gone off to europe 
he often goes
without so much
as a fare you well 
and i don t see
him for a year 
leah  i collected
the burnt linen
from the master s room 
mrs  fairfax  that s fine 
just go make up the bed 
jane  england is
a great power  adèle 
british ships set sail
from here to the outer
limits of our empire 
navigating the five oceans
and four corners of our world 
from canada  here 
all the way to the
south of africa
and the cape of good hope 
across the indian ocean 
to australia and new zealand 
and on to burma  china 
india and malaya 
 speaking french 
nothing 
on these distant horizons 
you will find all
manner of men 
 knocking on door 
he s coming
back tomorrow 
 breathing heavily 
he s given me
directions to prepare
all the rooms 
i m to get more staff
from the george inn 
miss ingram s coming 
supplies to be got 
the linen  mattresses   
i ll go to the george now 
no  no  i ll tell martha   
may i assist you 
mrs  fairfax 
oh   
 carriages approaching 
 chattering 
south facing rooms
for lady ingram
and miss ingram 
colonel dent and mrs  dent
must have the river view 
martha  i reckon
master s taken a fancy
to that miss ingram 
he may well have
asked her already 
undercook  i ll wager
he will by end of week 
you mark my words 
sophie  adèle 
 adèle chattering in french 
what s she saying 
mr  rochester is here 
everybody out 
 speaking french 
blanche  edward 
rochester  allow me 
miss ingram 
lady ingram  i d forgotten
how masculine
thornfield is
blanche  i think
you need more flowers 
rochester  i have
the fairest of all on my arm 
come away  adèle 
tonight  he wants both
of you in the drawing
room after dinner 
not me  surely 
i m instructed to tell you 
if you resist 
he ll come up
and get you himself 
but i don t have a dress 
don t worry  child 
who ll notice 
mademoiselle 
 laughing 
lady ingram  i thought you
were not fond of children 
mr  rochester 
rochester 
nor am i  lady ingram 
lord ingram 
what induced you
to take charge of her 
rochester  she was
left on my hands 
why don t you
send her to school 
rochester 
she has a governess 
poor child 
i had about half
a dozen in my day 
all detestable incubi 
blanche s brother  it s true 
 all chuckling 
mr  rochester 
beware the governess 
blanche  mama thinks
they re generally hysterics 
lady ingram 
or degenerates 
i thank heaven
i have done with them 
blanche  it s a miracle
i survived my education 
i remember
miss wilson screaming 
 you villainous child  
that s right  she tried
to set her hair on fire 
frequently  i might add 
anyway  enough
of this dreary race 
we shall have music
and a new subject 
signor eduardo 
what shall it be 
 playing harpsichord 
rochester 
i give you beauty 
blanche 
there s nothing
new to be said 
i give you back
male beauty 
lady ingram  well 
that s my son 
blanche s brother  hear hear 
a man should pay
no heed to his looks 
he should possess
only strength and valor 
gentleman or highwayman 
his beauty lies
in his power 
then a pirate
would do for you 
 continues playing
harpsichord 
 singing 
why did you
leave the room 
i am tired  sir 
why didn t you come
and speak to me 
i haven t seen you
for weeks 
it would have been normal
and polite to wish me
good evening 
you seemed engaged 
you look pale 
i am well 
what have you been doing
while i ve been away 
teaching adèle 
you re depressed 
what s the meaning of this 
your eyes are full   
what is it 
there s a gentleman
to see you  sir 
 sighing 
from spanish town 
jamaica 
and indeed i think
he does come from
some hot place
because he won t
take off his coat 
mr  richard mason 
i ve put him in
the morning room 
have i done wrong 
bring him to my study 
jane  this is a blow 
if i were to go
to those people
and they looked at me
coldly and sneered 
and then left me
one by one 
what would you do 
would you go with them 
no  sir 
i d stay with you 
you d dare condemnation

lady ingram

a servant has had
a nightmare  that s all

very  very unpleasant 
richard  fairfax 
drive 
it s a strange night
you ve passed 
yes  sir 
you showed no fear 
i was afraid of
the inner room 
you were in no danger 
mr  rochester 
who did that violence 
i cannot tell you 
why do you protect them 
i drag through life
a capital error 
its consequence
blights my existence 
for years  i ve sought
to escape it 
this spring 
i came home heart sore
and soul withered 
and i met a gentle stranger
whose society revives me 
with her  i feel
i could live again
in a higher  purer way 
tell me 
am i justified in
overleaping an obstacle
of custom to attain her 
there is an obstacle 
a mere conventional
impediment 
but what can it be 
if you cherish
an affection  sir 
then fortune alone
cannot impede you 
yes 
and if the lady
is of noble stock
and has indicated that
she may reciprocate   
jane  of whom do
you think i speak 
of miss ingram 
i m asking what
jane eyre would do
to secure my happiness 
i would do
anything for you  sir 
anything that was right 
you transfix me quite 
i feel i can speak
to you now
of my lovely one 
for you ve met her
and you know her 
she s a rare one 
isn t she 
fresh and healthy 
without soil or taint 
i m sure
she ll regenerate me
with a vengeance 
 people laughing 
blanche  you look
ridiculous 
rochester 
this game
is ridiculous 
excuse me  sir 
does that creeping
creature want you 
excuse me 
this is from my
old nurse  bessie 
she says my cousin
john reed is dead 
he squandered his fortune
and has committed suicide 
the news has so
shocked my aunt 
it s brought on a stroke 
what  the aunt
who cast you out 
she s been asking for me 
i parted from her badly
and i can t neglect
her wishes now 
promise me
you won t stay long 
mr  rochester 
i ve had no wages 
i need funds for my journey 
how much do i owe you 
thirty pounds 
here s 50 
that s too much 
take your wages  jane 
i cannot 
then i only have 10 
now you owe me 
indeed i do 
meantime  i shall
safeguard it here 
do you trust me
to keep it 
not a whit  sir 
you are not to be
trusted at all 
mrs  reed  jane eyre 
i ve twice done
you wrong 
and i broke the vow
i made to reed 
please  don t think of it 
open that box 
take out the letter
and read it 
 madam 
 will you have the goodness
to send me
 the address of my
niece  jane eyre 
 i desire her to come
to me at madeira 
 fortune has blessed
my endeavors 
 and as i am childless 
i wish to adopt her
 and bequeath her at my death
whatever i may have to leave 
 yours  john eyre  madeira  
this is dated three years ago 
why did i never hear of it 
because i wrote
and told him
you d died of typhus
at lowood school 
 mrs  reed crying 
you called the names
of the dead
down upon me 
you cursed me 
i would have loved you
if you d let me 
you were born
to be my torment 
then love me or
hate me as you will 
you have my full
and free forgiveness 
 groaning 
be at peace 
jane  my dear uncle 
some years ago 
my aunt reed mistakenly
informed you that i had died 
i am writing to tell you
that i m very much alive
and gratified to find
i have a relative 
i look forward to
our correspondence 
hoping one day we may meet 
i m currently living
at thornfield hall 
where i am governess
to the ward of
mr  edward fairfax rochester 
ah  there you are 
just like one
of your tricks 
to steal in along
with the twilight 
if i dared i d touch you
to see if you were real 
come  jane 
stay your wandering feet
at a friend s threshold 
thank you  mr  rochester 
for your great kindness 
i m strangely glad
to get back again 
there s been
nothing official yet 
but he s ordered
jewels from his bank
and he s making preparations
to travel to europe 
 door opening 
 sophie and adèle
chattering in french 
adèle 
mademoiselle 
he s taken to singing 
the operas miss ingram
favors so well 
we ll hear
their announcement
soon  i m sure 
 men chattering 
you are to be married 
i see mrs  fairfax has
intimated my intention
to put my neck
into the sacred noose 
adèle should
go to school 
and i must seek
another situation 
congratulations  sir 
thornfield is a pleasant
place in spring  isn t it 
yes  sir 
you ll be sorry
to part with it 
it s always the way
with events in life 
no sooner
have you got settled
than a voice cries 
 rise and move on  
i ll find you
a new situation  jane 
one i hope
that you ll accept 
i shall be ready
when your order
to march comes 
must i really lose
a faithful paid subordinate
such as yourself 
you must 
we ve been good friends 
haven t we 
yes  sir 
i ve a strange feeling
with regard to you 
as if i had a string
somewhere under my left ribs 
tightly knotted to
a similar string in you 
and if you were to leave 
i m afraid that
cord of communion
would snap 
and i ve a notion
that i d take to
bleeding inwardly 
as for you 
you d forget me 
how 
i have lived
a full life here 
i have not been
trampled on 
i have not
been petrified 
i have not been
excluded from every
glimpse of what is bright 
i have known you 
mr  rochester 
and it strikes me
with anguish to be
torn from you 
then why must you leave 
because of your wife 
i have no wife 
but you are
to be married 
jane  you must stay 
and become
nothing to you 
am i a machine
without feelings 
do you think that
because i am poor 
obscure  plain and little
that i am soulless
and heartless 
i have as much soul as you
and full as much heart 
and if god had blessed me
with beauty and wealth 
i could make it as hard
for you to leave me
as it is for i
to leave you 
i m not speaking to you
through mortal flesh 
it is my spirit that
addresses your spirit 
as if we d passed
through the grave and stood
at god s feet  equal 
as we are 
as we are 
i am a free human being
with an independent will 
which i now exert
to leave you 
then let your will
decide your destiny 
i offer you my hand 
my heart 
jane 
i ask you to pass
through life at my side 
you are my equal
and my likeness 
will you marry me 
are you mocking me 
do you doubt me 
entirely 
your bride is miss ingram 
miss ingram 
she is the machine
without feelings 
it s you  you rare 
unearthly thing 
poor and obscure
as you are 
please accept me
as your husband 
i must have you for my own 
you wish me
to be your wife 
i swear it 
you love me 
i do 
then  sir 
i will marry you 
 thunder rumbling 
good night 
good night  my love 
good night 
am i a monster 
is it so impossible
that mr  rochester
should love me 
no 
i ve long noticed
you were a sort
of pet of his 
but you re so young
and you re so little
acquainted with men 
i don t want to
grieve you  child 
but let me just put
you on your guard 
gentlemen in his position   
well  let s just say 
they re not accustomed
to marry their governesses 
until you are wed 
distrust yourself
as well as him 
please 
keep him at a distance 
come 
what is it 
jane eyre with
nothing to say 
everything seems unreal 
i am real enough 
you  sir  are most
phantom like of all 
 indistinct 
 adèle chattering in french 
i will be jane eyre
no longer 
man  edward 
rochester  move it 
rochester  have the carriage
loaded and ready
within the hour 
take courage  jane 
i will 
come on 
priest  i require
and charge you both 
as you will answer
at the dreadful day
of judgment 
when the secrets
of all hearts
shall be revealed 
that if either of you
do know of any impediment
why you may not be
joined together lawfully 
you do now confess it 
 door opening 
edward fairfax rochester   
the marriage cannot go on 
an insurmountable
impediment exists 
proceed 
briggs   i affirm
and can prove   
proceed 
    that edward fairfax
rochester was 
 15 years ago 
married to my sister 
 bertha antoinetta mason 
at st  james  church 
 spanish town  jamaica  
a copy of the register
is now in my possession 
signed  richard mason 
she lives at
thornfield hall 
 panting 
this girl knew
nothing of this 
she thought all
was fair and legal 
she never dreamt
she was being entrapped
into a feigned union
with a defrauded wretch 
come  jane 
come  all of you 
meet my wife 
get back 
go  all of you  go 
you re 15 years too late 
mrs  poole 
you ought to
give warning  sir 
 bertha humming 
this is bertha
antoinetta mason 
my wife 
richard  antoinetta 
it s i  richard 
grace  she has her quiet
times and her rages 
the windows are shuttered
lest she throw herself out 
we have no furniture 
as she can make a weapon
out of anything 
i take her for a turn
upon the roof each day 
securely held 
as she s taken to
thinking she can fly 
my own demon 
 screams 
 yelling 
jane 
forgive me  i m worthless 
how could i 
jane 
no tears 
why don t you cry 
why not scream at me 
i deserve a hail of fire 
i need some water 
of course 
 gasps 
jane 
how are you now 
i will be well again soon 
i know you 
you re thinking 
talking is of no use 
you re thinking how to act 
all is changed  sir 
i must leave you 
no  no 
jane  do you love me 
then the essential things
are the same 
be my wife 
you have a wife 
i pledge you my
honor  my fidelity   
you cannot 
   my love  until
death do us part 
what of truth 
i would have
told you the truth 
you are deceitful  sir 
i was wrong
to deceive you 
i see that now 
it was cowardly 
i should have appealed
to your spirit as i do now 
bertha antoinetta mason 
she was wanted by
my father for her fortune 
i hardly spoke with her
before the wedding 
i lived with her
for four years 
her temper ripened 
her vices sprang up 
violent and unchaste 
only cruelty would check her 
and i d not use cruelty 
i was chained to her
for life  jane 
not even the law
could free me 
have you ever set foot
in a madhouse  jane 
no  sir 
the inmates are caged
and baited like beasts 
i spared her
that at least 
jane 
i earnestly pity you  sir 
no 
 both crying 
who would you offend
by living with me 
who would care 
i would 
you d rather drive
me to madness
than break some
mere human law 
i must respect myself 
listen to me 
listen 
i could bend you
with my finger
and my thumb 
a mere reed you feel
in my hands 
but whatever i do
with this cage 
i cannot get at you 
and it is your soul
that i want 
why don t you come
of your own free will 
god help me 
 crying 
jane 
 sobbing 
 distant thunder 
st  john 
i asked how you were 
i m getting on very well 
do you find the
work too hard 
not at all 
is the solitude
an oppression 
i hardly have time
to notice it 
thank you  girls 
both  yes  ma am 
then perhaps
you are dwelling
on things past 
when i came to your door 
i had nothing 
now i have a home and work 
free and honest 
i thank god
for the generosity
of my friends 
what you had left
before i met you 
i don t know 
but i counsel you
to resist firmly
every temptation
to look back 
that s what i intend to do 
a year ago  i was myself
intensely miserable 
i scorned this weakness 
fought hard against it
and won 
i wonder if we
do not share
the same alloy 
you are ambitious 
i think 
and this little school
will not hold you for long 
is this yours 
yes 
what s the matter 
nothing 
good night 
 banging on door 
jane 
miss eyre 
what brings you
from your hearth
on a night like this 
there is no bad
news  i hope 
how easily alarmed
you are  miss eyre 
please  won t
you sit down 
thank you  miss eyre 
i saw an advertisement
in the times from
a solicitor named briggs
inquiring of a jane eyre 
i knew a jane elliott 
this paper
resolved my suspicion
into certainty 
and so  i wrote to him 
he told the story of
a young governess 
and her employer 
a mr  fairfax rochester   
mr  rivers 
i can guess your feelings 
but please hear me 
as you know so much 
perhaps you ll tell
me how he is 
who 
mr  rochester 
i m ignorant of
all concerning him 
but he has
been seeking me 
no  he hasn t 
mr  briggs has 
and what does
he want with me 
merely to tell you
that your uncle 
mr  john eyre of
madeira  is dead 
that he has left you
all his property
and that you
are now rich 
what 
you are rich 
quite an heiress 
will you ask how
much you are worth 
how much am i worth 
twenty thousand pounds 
 laughing 
if you had committed
a murder
and i d found you out 
you could scarcely
look more aghast 
there must be
some mistake 
not at all 
you look desperately
miserable about it 
i must say 
please 
sit down 
i ve shocked you 
mr  st  john 
the debt i owe to you
and your sisters   
is nothing 
you saved my life 
please write to them 
this money frees us 
they will have 5 000 each 
and so will you 
if you ll take it 
certainly not 
and if you would accept
me as a sister 
perhaps we could
live together 
at moor house 
i told you the
news too quickly 
you re confused 
my only relative is dead 
you have family 
you cannot know
what isolation means 
and you cannot know
what it means
to be wealthy 
i have been alone always 
i ve never had
a brother or sisters 
please  let me be yours 
are you reluctant
to have me 
no  miss eyre 
on the contrary 
i shall write
to my sisters 
as you request 
brother 
st  john 
we are bid to work
while it is day 
for night cometh 
when no man shall work 
help us to choose
the harder path 
for as our master
is long suffering 
so must we be 
amen 
amen 
amen 
good night 
good night 
good night 
is jane not
our sister  too 
good night 
st  john 
 whispering  jane 
 footsteps approaching 
i go to india
in six weeks 
i can see what
your gifts are
and why they were given 
god intended you
for a missionary s wife 
i want to claim you 
i m not fit for it 
i trust you
unreservedly 
and know this 
in you 
i recognize
a fellow soul 
i ll go with you
to india 
jane 
i ll go if
i may go free 
free 
how can i take out
to india a girl of 19
unless she is my wife 
i love you as a brother 
as a husband  no 
my heart is mute 
then i must speak for it 
you ve said you ll come 
we shall marry 
and undoubtedly
enough of love
would follow 
enough of love 
yes  quite enough 
of love 
yes  in all its forms 
forgive me  but
the very name of love
is an apple of discord
between us 
my dear brother 
abandon your
scheme of marriage 
why this refusal 
it makes no sense 
i earnestly wish
to be your friend 
you can t give
half a sacrifice 
you must give all 
to marry you
would kill me 
kill you 
those words are
unfeminine and untrue 
i know where your heart turns
and to what it still clings 
say his name 
say it  say it 
rochester  jane 
why have you not
yet crushed this
lawless passion 
jane 
it offends me and
it offends god 
what is it 
where are you 
wait for me 
why do you speak to the air 
jane 
rochester  jane 
i am coming 
jane 
wait  please  miss 
 wood creaking 
jane eyre 
i thought
gypsies were come 
and then i saw you 
and i thought 
it cannot be 
you are a ghost 
no one knows
how it started 
i expect that mrs  poole
took too much of
the gin and water 
and as she slept 
the lady 
mrs  rochester 
unhooked the keys 
she did what she failed
to do a year ago 
set the whole place
to fire 
we would have
all perished
in the smoke 
but mr  rochester
would not rest till
we were all safe 
then he went
in for her 
the flames were
tearing up so high
it brought men running
from the village 
i saw her standing
on the roof 
the very edge 
i heard mr  rochester
beg her to come down 
but she jumped 
mr  rochester remained 
as if he would not move
until the fire consumed him 
i didn t know 
i didn t know
it was his wife 
i promise you 
why did you
run away  child 
i would have helped you 
i had some money saved 
you could have come to me 
where is he 
 whining 
pilot 
who s there 
this hand   
jane eyre 
edward  i am
come back to you 
fairfax rochester
with nothing to say 
you are altogether
a human being  jane
