burns
i will not have you

i see you are mortifying
this girls flesh
sir she was not
it is your mission
to render her contrite
and selfdenying
continue
helen groans
tray shattering
the new girl
this is the pedestal
of infamy
and you will remain
upon it all day long
you will have neither
food nor drink
for you must learn
how barren is the
life of a sinner
children i exhort you
to shun her exclude her
shut her out
from this day forth
withhold the hand
of friendship
and deny your love
to jane eyre
the liar
how do you bear
being struck
miss scatcherd hits me
to improve me
shes tormented
by my faults
if she hit me
id get that birch
and break it
under her nose
shed find another
soon enough
my father used to preach
that lifes too short
to spend in nursing
animosity
at my aunts house
i was solitary
and despised
she thought i could do
without one bit of
love or kindness
you are loved
theres an invisible world
all around you
a kingdom of spirits
commissioned to
guard you jane
do you not see them
jane
have you something
for me to do
youre doing
something already

coughs

carriage rolling away
mr rivers i wondered
if you had yet heard
of any work i could do
i found you a situation
some time ago
but ive delayed telling you
because the work is lowly
and i fear youll scorn it
i shant mind what i do
when i took over
the parish two years ago
it had no school
i opened one for boys
i now intend to
open one for girls
the schoolmistress
will have a cottage paid
for by benefactors
and shell receive
15 a year
you can see how humble
how ignoble it is
mr rivers
thank you
i accept
with all my heart
but you comprehend me
tis a village school
cottagers daughters
what will you do
with all your fine
accomplishments
i will save them
till theyre wanted
they will keep
rochester jane
you will be quite
alone here
im not afraid
of solitude
this is my first home
where i am neither dependent
nor subordinate to anyone
thank you mr st john

very well

lucky to have you

john is taking your trunk
up to your room
ive put you at the
back of the house
i hope you dont mind
the rooms at the
front have much
finer furniture
but theyre so gloomy
and solitary i think
im glad youre come
to be sure this is
a grand old house
but i must confess that
in winter one can feel
a little dreary and alone
leahs a very nice girl
and john and martha
are good people too
but they are servants
one cannot talk to them
on terms of equality
jane am i meeting
miss fairfax tonight

miss fairfax
my pupil

connection between
mr rochester and me
his mother was a fairfax
but id never presume on it
heavens me
owner of thornfield
we shall have a cheerful
house this winter
with miss varens
here and with you
well have quite
a merry time of it
im sure that last winter
and what a severe one it was
if it didnt rain it snowed
if it didnt snow it blew
i declare not one soul
came to the house from
november to february
when spring finally came
i thought it a great relief
i hadnt gone distracted
laughing
ive had martha lay a fire
i hope youll be comfortable
faint chattering
gardener now get that lot
turned over before
frost comes down
boy do you want
the upper bit doing

mrs fairfax
we must open the
window in the study today
to let in some air
ive never seen such
an ancient old house
how beautifully
youve preserved it
well mr rochesters visits
are always unexpected
he doesnt like
to arrive and find
everything all swathed up
so i keep it in
constant readiness
now come and
meet miss varens
did i mention
shes french
speaking french
will you ask her
about her parents
mr rochester

before it was a butterfly
caterpillar
i shall leave
and walk into town
gasps do not go
begged her maid
the gytrash roams
these hills
speaks french
a spirit of the north
that lies in wait
for travelers
it tenants the
carcasses of beasts
possesses horses
wolves great dogs
you know it
only by its eyes
which burn as
red as coals
and if one should
chance upon you
speaking french
nothing a mere story
speaking french
what nonsense
mrs fairfax
whatever brings
you up here
ive been waiting
to pour our tea
im not in need of tea
thank you
its a quiet life
isnt it
this isolated house
a still doom for
a young woman
i wish a woman could
have action in her life
like a man
it agitates me to pain
that the skyline over
there is ever our limit
i long sometimes
for a power of vision
that would overpass it
if i could behold
all i imagine
ive never seen a city
ive never
spoken with men
and i fear my
whole life will pass
now exercise
and fresh air
great cures for
anything they say
i have some letters to post
will you take them
panting
wood creaking
horse neighing
up up you
cursed beast up
groaning
stand back
are you injured sir
may i be of some help
where did you
come from
just below
at thornfield hall
i am the governess
im on my way
to post a letter
can i fetch
someone to help
the governess
you may help me yourself
get hold of his bridle
and lead him to me
if you would be so kind
neighing
it would be easier
to bring me to the horse
come here
i must beg of you
to please come here
miss governess
hold it
make haste
with your letter
for who knows
what might lurk in
these dark woods
mrs fairfax leah
go and light the fire in
the masters bedroom
and tell martha
to prepare for tea
leah yes maam
mr rochesters here
go and change your frock
he wishes to meet you
leah take her cloak
i have to change
i always dress for
the evening when
mr rochesters here
but all my dresses
are the same
you must have
one thats better
hes in a terrible humor
his horse fell
in hay lane and
his ankle is sprained
hes at the doctor
this half hour
where have you been
speaking french
rochester let her sit
ive examined ad√®le
and i find youve taken
great pains with her
shes not bright
she has no talents
yet in a short time
shes improved
thank you mr rochester
youve been resident
here three months
yes sir
and from whence
do you hail
whats your tale of woe
pardon
all governesses
have a tale of woe
whats yours
i was brought up by my aunt
mrs reed of gateshead
in a house even
finer than this
i then attended
lowood school
where i received
as good an education
as i could hope for
i have no tale
of woe sir
where are your parents
dead
do you remember them
no
and why are you
not with mrs reed
of gateshead now
she cast me off sir
why
because i was burdensome
and she disliked me
no tale of woe
mrs fairfax
i daily thank providence
for sending us miss eyre
shes an invaluable
dont trouble yourself to
give her a character
ill judge for myself
i have her to thank
for this sprain
sir
you bewitched my horse
i did not
were you waiting
for your people
on that lane
i have no people sir
i mean for the imps
and elves and little
green men
the sad truth is
they are all gone
your land is neither wild
nor savage enough for them
ad√®le brought me these
are they yours
yes sir
where did you
get your copies
out of my head
that head i now see
on your shoulders
yes sir
whos this
the evening star
were you happy when
you painted these
yes
to paint is one of
the keenest pleasures
i have ever known
then your pleasures
have been few
are you satisfied
with them
far from it
i imagine things im
powerless to execute
youve secured the
shadow of your thoughts
yet the drawings
are for a schoolgirl
peculiar
good night
jane come ad√®le
most merciful father
we give thee humble
thanks for this
thy special bounty
amen
amen
amen
faint piano music
sit nicely please ad√®le
piano lid closing
rochester pilot
door slamming
pilot barking
rochester shouting
pilot come here
gunshots
rochester go on
further down
rochester by the river
hes very abrupt
and changeful
what manner
of man is he
hes a good master
hes fine company
too when he
gunshots
except when hes
in an ill humor
ad√®le
rochester i hate to reload
gunshot
rochester grunts
ad√®le speaks french
laughing
on three
one two three
ready
oh
think thats it sir
take it down to the river
come on
playing piano
keep it
speaking french
take it away and
disembowel it
beautiful
miss eyre
im not fond
of children
nor do i particularly enjoy
simpleminded old ladies
but you might suit me
if you would
how sir
by distracting me
from the mire of
my thoughts
speaking french
that is how maman
used to say
precisely
and thats
how she charmed
my english gold
out of my english pocket
mrs fairfax
lets go and try it on
shall we
sighing
your gaze is very
direct miss eyre
do you think me handsome
no sir
what fault do
you find with me
i have all my limbs
and features
i beg your pardon sir
i ought to have replied
that beauty is of
little consequence
youre blushing miss eyre
and though
youre not pretty any more
than i am handsome
i must say it becomes you
and now i see
youre fascinated by
the flowers on the rug
come speak to me
fact is miss eyre
id like to draw you out
you have rather
the look of another
world about you
i dont wish to treat
you as inferior
yet youd command
me to speak
are you very hurt by
my tone of command
there are few masters
whod trouble to enquire
whether their paid
subordinates
were hurt by their commands
paid subordinate
id forgotten the salary
well on that
mercenary ground
will you consent
to speak as my equal
without thinking that
the request arises
from insolence
id never mistake
informality for
insolence sir
one i rather like
the other nothing freeborn
should ever submit to
humbug
even for a salary
most freeborn things
would submit to
anything for a salary
but i mentally shake
hands with you
for your answer
not three in 3000
schoolgirl governesses
would have answered me
as youve just done
then youve not
spent much time in
our company sir
im the same plain kind
of bird as all the rest
with my common tale of woe
i envy you
how
your openness
your unpolluted mind
when i was your age
fate dealt me a blow
and since happiness
is denied me
ive a right to get
pleasure in its stead
and i will get it
cost what it may
then youll degenerate
still more
but miss eyre
if the pleasure
i was seeking was
sweet and fresh
if it was an inspiration
if it wore the robes of
an angel of light
what then
to speak truth sir
i dont understand you at all
i fear the conversation
has got out of my depth
youre afraid of me
im not afraid
ive simply no wish
to talk nonsense
laughs
sighs
do you never laugh
miss eyre
only rarely perhaps
but youre not
naturally austere
any more than
im naturally vicious
i can see in you
the glance of a
curious sort of bird
through the closeset
bars of a cage
a vivid restless captive
were it but free
it would soar cloudhigh
door opening
mrs fairfax leah
have you seen mrs poole
leah yes maam
the masters in no mood
for any more mistakes
woman laughing
whos there
faint thud
louder thud
coughing
wake up sir
wake up sir
wake up
hissing
the quilt
give it here
coughing
rochester grunting
a noise aroused me
from my sleep
what noise
there was someone
at my door
stay here
dont make a sound
ticking
say nothing about this
youre no talking fool
but
ill account for
this state of affairs
say nothing
yes sir
is that how you
would leave me
jane fire is
a horrible death
youve saved my life
dont walk past me
as if we were strangers
but what am i to do then
ive a pleasure in
owing you my life
there is no debt
i knew you would do me
good in some way
i saw it in your eyes
when i first beheld you
their expression did
not strike my very inmost
being so for nothing
people talk of natural
sympathies you
whispering
good night then sir
you will leave me then
i am cold
go
birds chirping
has mr rochester
not sent for us today
why hes gone away
were you not aware
he left after breakfast
hes gone to the leas
its mr eshtons place
i believe blanche
ingram is there
shes a great
favorite of his
i saw her two years
ago when mr rochester
gave a party here
shes a most
elegant girl
they sang a duet together
they made a lovely harmony
i was quite surprised
he didnt make a proposal
but she has no fortune
in every other way
theyd make
a splendid match
perhaps its his
intention now
hes far more likely to
have gone off to europe
he often goes
without so much
as a fareyouwell
and i dont see
him for a year
leah i collected
the burnt linen
from the masters room
mrs fairfax thats fine
just go make up the bed
jane england is
a great power ad√®le
british ships set sail
from here to the outer
limits of our empire
navigating the five oceans
and four corners of our world
from canada here
all the way to the
south of africa
and the cape of good hope
across the indian ocean
to australia and new zealand
and on to burma china
india and malaya
speaking french
nothing
on these distant horizons
you will find all
manner of men
knocking on door

sophie ad√®le
ad√®le chattering in french

blanche edward
rochester allow me
miss ingram

rochester she was
left on my hands

rochester

poor child

a dozen in my day
all detestable incubi
blanches brother its true
all chuckling
mr rochester
beware the governess
blanche mama thinks
theyre generally hysterics
lady ingram
or degenerates
i thank heaven
i have done with them
blanche its a miracle
i survived my education
i remember
miss wilson screaming
you villainous child
thats right she tried
to set her hair on fire
frequently i might add
anyway enough
of this dreary race
we shall have music
and a new subject
signor eduardo
what shall it be
playing harpsichord
rochester
i give you beauty
blanche
theres nothing
new to be said
i give you back
male beauty
lady ingram well
thats my son
blanches brother hear hear
a man should pay
no heed to his looks
he should possess
only strength and valor
gentleman or highwayman
his beauty lies
in his power
then a pirate
would do for you
continues playing
harpsichord
singing
why did you
leave the room
i am tired sir
why didnt you come
and speak to me
i havent seen you
for weeks
it would have been normal
and polite to wish me
good evening
you seemed engaged
you look pale
i am well
what have you been doing
while ive been away
teaching ad√®le
youre depressed
whats the meaning of this
your eyes are full
what is it
theres a gentleman
to see you sir
sighing
from spanish town
jamaica
and indeed i think
he does come from
some hot place
because he wont
take off his coat
mr richard mason
ive put him in
the morning room
have i done wrong
bring him to my study
jane this is a blow
if i were to go
to those people
and they looked at me
coldly and sneered
and then left me
one by one
what would you do
would you go with them
no sir
id stay with you
youd dare condemnation
for my sake
for the sake of any friend
who deserved it
door closing
richard

wind howling
thud
gasps
door opening

flesh is torn

very very unpleasant
richard fairfax
drive
its a strange night
youve passed
yes sir
you showed no fear
i was afraid of
the inner room
you were in no danger
mr rochester
who did that violence
i cannot tell you
why do you protect them
i drag through life
a capital error
its consequence
blights my existence
for years ive sought
to escape it
this spring
i came home heartsore
and soulwithered
and i met a gentle stranger
whose society revives me
with her i feel
i could live again
in a higher purer way
tell me
am i justified in
overleaping an obstacle
of custom to attain her
there is an obstacle
a mere conventional
impediment
but what can it be
if you cherish
an affection sir
then fortune alone
cannot impede you
yes
and if the lady
is of noble stock
and has indicated that
she may reciprocate
jane of whom do
you think i speak
of miss ingram
im asking what
jane eyre would do
to secure my happiness
i would do
anything for you sir
anything that was right
you transfix me quite
i feel i can speak
to you now
of my lovely one
for youve met her
and you know her
shes a rare one
isnt she
fresh and healthy
without soil or taint
im sure
shell regenerate me
with a vengeance
people laughing
blanche you look
ridiculous
rochester
this game
is ridiculous
excuse me sir
does that creeping
creature want you
excuse me
this is from my
old nurse bessie
she says my cousin
john reed is dead
he squandered his fortune
and has committed suicide
the news has so
shocked my aunt
its brought on a stroke
what the aunt
who cast you out
shes been asking for me
i parted from her badly
and i cant neglect
her wishes now
promise me
you wont stay long
mr rochester
ive had no wages
i need funds for my journey
how much do i owe you
thirty pounds
heres 50
thats too much
take your wages jane
i cannot
then i only have 10
now you owe me
indeed i do
meantime i shall
safeguard it here
do you trust me
to keep it
not a whit sir
you are not to be
trusted at all
mrs reed jane eyre
ive twice done
you wrong
and i broke the vow
i made to reed
please dont think of it
open that box
take out the letter
and read it
madam
will you have the goodness
to send me
the address of my
niece jane eyre
i desire her to come
to me at madeira
fortune has blessed
my endeavors
and as i am childless
i wish to adopt her
and bequeath her at my death
whatever i may have to leave
yours john eyre madeira
this is dated three years ago
why did i never hear of it
because i wrote
and told him
youd died of typhus
at lowood school
mrs reed crying
you called the names
of the dead
down upon me
you cursed me
i would have loved you
if youd let me
you were born
to be my torment
then love me or
hate me as you will
you have my full
and free forgiveness
groaning

jane my dear uncle
some years ago
my aunt reed mistakenly
informed you that i had died
i am writing to tell you
that im very much alive
and gratified to find
i have a relative
i look forward to
our correspondence
hoping one day we may meet
im currently living
at thornfield hall
where i am governess
to the ward of
mr edward fairfax rochester
ah there you are
just like one
of your tricks
to steal in along
with the twilight
if i dared id touch you
to see if you were real
come jane
stay your wandering feet
at a friends threshold
thank you mr rochester
for your great kindness
im strangely glad
to get back again
theres been
nothing official yet
but hes ordered
jewels from his bank
and hes making preparations
to travel to europe
door opening
sophie and ad√®le
chattering in french
ad√®le
mademoiselle
hes taken to singing
the operas miss ingram
favors so well
well hear
their announcement
soon im sure
men chattering
you are to be married
i see mrs fairfax has
intimated my intention
to put my neck
into the sacred noose
ad√®le should
go to school
and i must seek
another situation
congratulations sir
thornfield is a pleasant
place in spring isnt it
yes sir
youll be sorry
to part with it
its always the way
with events in life
no sooner
have you got settled
than a voice cries
rise and move on
ill find you
a new situation jane
one i hope
that youll accept
i shall be ready
when your order
to march comes
must i really lose
a faithful paid subordinate
such as yourself
you must
weve been good friends
havent we
yes sir
ive a strange feeling
with regard to you
as if i had a string
somewhere under my left ribs
tightly knotted to
a similar string in you
and if you were to leave
im afraid that
cord of communion
would snap
and ive a notion
that id take to
bleeding inwardly
as for you
youd forget me
how
i have lived
a full life here
i have not been
trampled on
i have not
been petrified
i have not been
excluded from every
glimpse of what is bright
i have known you
mr rochester
and it strikes me
with anguish to be
torn from you
then why must you leave
because of your wife
i have no wife
but you are
to be married
jane you must stay
and become
nothing to you
am i a machine
without feelings
do you think that
because i am poor
obscure plain and little
that i am soulless
and heartless
i have as much soul as you
and full as much heart
and if god had blessed me
with beauty and wealth
i could make it as hard
for you to leave me
as it is for i
to leave you
im not speaking to you
through mortal flesh
it is my spirit that
addresses your spirit
as if wed passed
through the grave and stood
at gods feet equal
as we are
as we are
i am a free human being
with an independent will
which i now exert
to leave you
then let your will
decide your destiny
i offer you my hand
my heart
jane
i ask you to pass
through life at my side
you are my equal
and my likeness
will you marry me
are you mocking me
do you doubt me
entirely
your bride is miss ingram
miss ingram
she is the machine
without feelings
its you you rare
unearthly thing
poor and obscure
as you are
please accept me
as your husband
i must have you for my own
you wish me
to be your wife
i swear it
you love me
i do
then sir
i will marry you
thunder rumbling
good night
good night my love
good night
am i a monster
is it so impossible
that mr rochester
should love me
no
ive long noticed
you were a sort
of pet of his
but youre so young
and youre so little
acquainted with men
i dont want to
grieve you child
but let me just put
you on your guard
gentlemen in his position
well lets just say
theyre not accustomed
to marry their governesses
until you are wed
distrust yourself
as well as him
please
keep him at a distance
come
what is it
jane eyre with
nothing to say
everything seems unreal
i am real enough
you sir are most
phantomlike of all
indistinct
ad√®le chattering in french
i will be jane eyre
no longer
man edward
rochester move it
rochester have the carriage
loaded and ready
within the hour
take courage jane
i will
come on
priest i require
and charge you both
as you will answer
at the dreadful day
of judgment
when the secrets
of all hearts
shall be revealed
that if either of you
do know of any impediment
why you may not be
joined together lawfully
you do now confess it
door opening
edward fairfax rochester
the marriage cannot go on
an insurmountable
impediment exists
proceed
briggs i affirm
and can prove
proceed
that edward fairfax
rochester was
15 years ago
married to my sister
bertha antoinetta mason
at st james church
spanish town jamaica
a copy of the register
is now in my possession
signed richard mason
she lives at
thornfield hall
panting
this girl knew
nothing of this
she thought all
was fair and legal
she never dreamt
she was being entrapped
into a feigned union
with a defrauded wretch
come jane
come all of you
meet my wife
get back
go all of you go
youre 15 years too late
mrs poole
you ought to
give warning sir
bertha humming
this is bertha
antoinetta mason
my wife
richard antoinetta
its i richard
grace she has her quiet
times and her rages
the windows are shuttered
lest she throw herself out
we have no furniture
as she can make a weapon
out of anything
i take her for a turn
upon the roof each day
securely held
as shes taken to
thinking she can fly
my own demon
screams
yelling
jane
forgive me im worthless
how could i
jane
no tears
why dont you cry
why not scream at me
i deserve a hail of fire
i need some water
of course
gasps
jane
how are you now
i will be well again soon
i know you
youre thinking
talking is of no use
youre thinking how to act
all is changed sir
i must leave you
no no
jane do you love me
then the essential things
are the same
be my wife
you have a wife
i pledge you my
honor my fidelity
you cannot
my love until
death do us part
what of truth
i would have
told you the truth
you are deceitful sir
i was wrong
to deceive you
i see that now
it was cowardly
i should have appealed
to your spirit as i do now
bertha antoinetta mason
she was wanted by
my father for her fortune
i hardly spoke with her
before the wedding
i lived with her
for four years
her temper ripened
her vices sprang up
violent and unchaste
only cruelty would check her
and id not use cruelty
i was chained to her
for life jane
not even the law
could free me
have you ever set foot
in a madhouse jane
no sir
the inmates are caged
and baited like beasts
i spared her
that at least
jane
i earnestly pity you sir
no
both crying
who would you offend
by living with me
who would care
i would
youd rather drive
me to madness
than break some
mere human law
i must respect myself
listen to me
listen
i could bend you
with my finger
and my thumb
a mere reed you feel
in my hands
but whatever i do
with this cage
i cannot get at you
and it is your soul
that i want
why dont you come
of your own free will
god help me
crying
jane
sobbing
distant thunder
st john
i asked how you were
im getting on very well
do you find the
work too hard
not at all
is the solitude
an oppression
i hardly have time
to notice it
thank you girls
both yes maam
then perhaps
you are dwelling
on things past
when i came to your door
i had nothing
now i have a home and work
free and honest
i thank god
for the generosity
of my friends
what you had left
before i met you
i dont know
but i counsel you
to resist firmly
every temptation
to look back
thats what i intend to do
a year ago i was myself
intensely miserable
i scorned this weakness
fought hard against it
and won
i wonder if we
do not share
the same alloy
you are ambitious
i think
and this little school
will not hold you for long
is this yours
yes
whats the matter
nothing
good night
banging on door
jane
miss eyre
what brings you
from your hearth
on a night like this
there is no bad
news i hope
how easily alarmed
you are miss eyre
please wont
you sit down
thank you miss eyre
i saw an advertisement
in the times from
a solicitor named briggs
inquiring of a jane eyre
i knew a jane elliott
this paper
resolved my suspicion
into certainty
and so i wrote to him
he told the story of
a young governess
and her employer
a mr fairfax rochester
mr rivers
i can guess your feelings
but please hear me
as you know so much
perhaps youll tell
me how he is
who
mr rochester
im ignorant of
all concerning him
but he has
been seeking me
no he hasnt
mr briggs has
and what does
he want with me
merely to tell you
that your uncle
mr john eyre of
madeira is dead
that he has left you
all his property
and that you
are now rich
what
you are rich
quite an heiress
will you ask how
much you are worth
how much am i worth
twenty thousand pounds
laughing
if you had committed
a murder
and id found you out
you could scarcely
look more aghast
there must be
some mistake
not at all
you look desperately
miserable about it
i must say
please
sit down
ive shocked you
mr st john
the debt i owe to you
and your sisters
is nothing
you saved my life
please write to them
this money frees us
they will have 5000 each
and so will you
if youll take it
certainly not
and if you would accept
me as a sister
perhaps we could
live together
at moor house
i told you the
news too quickly
youre confused
my only relative is dead
you have family
you cannot know
what isolation means
and you cannot know
what it means
to be wealthy
i have been alone always
ive never had
a brother or sisters
please let me be yours
are you reluctant
to have me
no miss eyre
on the contrary
i shall write
to my sisters
as you request
brother
st john
we are bid to work
while it is day
for night cometh
when no man shall work
help us to choose
the harder path
for as our master
is longsuffering
so must we be
amen
amen
amen
good night
good night
good night
is jane not
our sister too
good night
st john
whispering jane
footsteps approaching
i go to india
in six weeks
i can see what
your gifts are
and why they were given
god intended you
for a missionarys wife
i want to claim you
im not fit for it
i trust you
unreservedly
and know this
in you
i recognize
a fellow soul
ill go with you
to india
jane
ill go if
i may go free
free
how can i take out
to india a girl of 19
unless she is my wife
i love you as a brother
as a husband no
my heart is mute
then i must speak for it
youve said youll come
we shall marry
and undoubtedly
enough of love
would follow
enough of love
yes quite enough
of love
yes in all its forms
forgive me but
the very name of love
is an apple of discord
between us
my dear brother
abandon your
scheme of marriage
why this refusal
it makes no sense
i earnestly wish
to be your friend
you cant give
half a sacrifice
you must give all
to marry you
would kill me
kill you
those words are
unfeminine and untrue
i know where your heart turns
and to what it still clings
say his name
say it say it
rochester jane
why have you not
yet crushed this
lawless passion
jane
it offends me and
it offends god
what is it
where are you
wait for me
why do you speak to the air
jane
rochester jane
i am coming
jane
wait please miss
wood creaking
jane eyre
i thought
gypsies were come
and then i saw you
and i thought
it cannot be
you are a ghost
no one knows
how it started
i expect that mrs poole
took too much of
the gin and water
and as she slept
the lady
mrs rochester
unhooked the keys
she did what she failed
to do a year ago
set the whole place
to fire
we would have
all perished
in the smoke
but mr rochester
would not rest till
we were all safe
then he went
in for her
the flames were
tearing up so high
it brought men running
from the village
i saw her standing
on the roof
the very edge
i heard mr rochester
beg her to come down
but she jumped
mr rochester remained
as if he would not move
until the fire consumed him
i didnt know
i didnt know
it was his wife
i promise you
why did you
run away child
i would have helped you
i had some money saved
you could have come to me
where is he
whining
pilot
whos there
this hand
jane eyre
edward i am
come back to you
fairfax rochester
with nothing to say
you are altogether
a human being jane
