   it could only be a kiss 
for l am a virgin   
   and could never   
   go all the way 
unless  of course  l were married 
or if a man pledged
his endless love   
   to me 
or if l knew that he
desperately cared for me 
or if he were really cute 
but my darling  you re shivering 
are you cold  what are you wearing
underneath that cape 
practically nothing 
oh  except that 
l forgot to tell you about
my chastity belt  lt s an everlast 
l ll bet 
oh  darling   
   don t despair   
   for it is written on a scroll 
 one day  he who is destined
for me   
   shall be endowed
with the magical key   
   that will bring an end to my   
   virginity  
oh  marian   
   if only t were me
