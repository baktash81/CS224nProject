who ll open bidding for this slave 
the lady of the moons 
no woman here
gives better massages 
her scalp massages
will make you sleep like a baby 
her leg massages

 a masseuse is worth
more than all wise men

and come here

nur ed din  wake up

making that 
look 
run to the market

but listen very carefully

it s a handsome offer 
you re a fool
if you don t take it  my boy 
very well  but stay away from me 
christian  why do you follow me 
i ask only for something to eat 
my belly s empty 
i have nothing  go with god 
who won t feed a guest
is an ingrate in god s eyes 
what is it 
what are you reading 
listen   
my eyes saw her 
to my great misfortune 
what agony it was
to leave her there 
poets of my court   
let s see if it s true
that poets can speak
even of what they haven t seen 
compose a poem
beginning with these words 
 my eyes saw her 
to my great misfortune 
what agony it was
to leave her there  
sium 
 my eyes saw her 
to my great misfortune 
what agony it was
to leave her there 
that gazelle who captured my heart
 neath the shade of two palms 
over her body she poured water
from a silver vase 
she saw me
and hid her love mound 
but it peered out
from between her fingers 
ah  to lie with her
for an hour or two  
 i said to two youths 
   love you  
have you any money  
they replied 
  yes    i answered
 and i spend it generously   
which those fine lads exclaimed 
it s a deal  
look there 
who ere those three boys  
you boys 
may i read some verses to you 
i wrote them long ago 
when i was almost
as young as you 
 a man hoary with age 
but with youthful desires 
loves handsome young men
and delights in distraction 
he arises in the morning
in the spirit of mosul  
oh  city of purity  
but dreams all day
of the sinful life of aleppo  
and now i d like
to propose something 
  we re listening 
  tell us 
come to my house 
where we always enjoy nice things 
fine wine
brought by the brothers
of the monastery   
lamb  and all manner of fowl 
let us eat and drink 
and then you ll take pleasure
with each other 
and  if you wish 
all three will pleasure me 
all right 
come 
 the greatest joy
is that of a young reveler
with handsome boys
for company 
one sings for him 
one drinks to his health 
and the other offers
his mouth to be kissed  
sium  compose a poem
about each of us 
 l would give my life
for the tenderness of this cheek 
for it s worth more than any sum  
 blessed be he who created
these smooth hairless cheeks
and gave this skin
such a beautiful hue  
 while my soul remains
in this tranquil village 
my heart is torn
between two desires 
one  for the minaret of baghdad 
the other for the land
of the two mosques  
  what is your name 
  berhane 
  how old are you 
  fifteen 
  are you married 
  no  and i plan never to marry 
why  have women hurt you 
no  but books say
they re treacherous 
 heaven on earth
is to be found at their breasts 
and the moon shines
above their mound of love  
that too is written in books  my boy 
but it s in their nature to betray men 
whether near or far 
they paint their eyes and nails
and braid their hair
and cause you nothing but woe 
i have a proposition 
will you come to my palace 
certainly  my lord  thank you 
  what is your name 
  giana 
  how old are you 
  fifteen 
  would you like to come with me 
  gladly 
come  let s go 
you ll lose your bet  zeudi 
your girl is a pot of piss
compared to my branch of myrrh 
no point arguing which is fairest 
we ve lulled them to sleep
with different potions
so they ll wake at different hours 
have we not 
they ll judge for themselves 
you and i will never agree 
she s far fairer than him 
just look at her 
i believe you re mistaken 
he is the fairest 
love will decide 
we ll wake them 
and the one who falls in love
with the other is the less beautiful 
for the plain always fall in love
with the beautiful 
very well 
we ll let love decide 
what god wills  happens 
what he doesn t  doesn t 
neither of us won 
each has fallen for the other
in equal measure 
each is the mirror of the other 
two full moons in the same sky 
  how did you get in 
  gate or courtyard   it s all the same 
you recognize me  zumurrud 
you dared say
my member never grew firm 
now you ll receive
your just punishment 
god will punish you for this 
nur ed din 
zumurrud 
blood of my blood 
zumurrud 
zumurrud  where are you 
where are you 
what s your name  handsome lad 
and why are you crying

mabuba  budur

 taj al muluk 
son of king suleiman 
grew into such
a handsome young man
that everyone who saw him
was enchanted
poems were written praising him 
and even the purest souls
grew shameless for his love 
so resplendent was his beauty 
as the poet said 
 i embraced him
and grew drunk from his scent 
swaying like a windswept branch 
i grew drunk without drinking 
intoxicated on the liquor of his saliva   
 dismounting from his horse 
taj spied a gentle and handsome
young man dressed in black 
but the youth s beauty seemed faded 
and he appeared dejected 
like one separated
from his loved ones  
what s that paper 
nothing of any use to you 
show me 
glory to god  who teaches a man
what he didn t know 
why did you begin to cry
when you saw this 
mine is a very long story 
the events linking me to that scroll
and to her that made it
are very strange 
tell me your story 
and of her who drew these gazelles 
my name is aziz 
and i was engaged to my cousin aziza 
on the day of the wedding 
when everything was ready 
i went to have my bath 
all the best  aziz 
best wishes to you and aziza 
good bye  aziz 
come back to see us one day 
you smell so good  aziz 
aziza  my bride 
ah  i just remembered 
i forgot to invite
my best friend  ali 
i ll be right back 
what are you doing 
aziza s waiting 
you sat on your kerchief 
now you can t
wipe your brow with it 
 the sun and moon marvel
when he appears 
and rosebuds blush in shame
to see his curls  
now you return  
all were here  the qadi 
guards  emirs  merchants 
they ate and drank 
but you didn t appear  and they left 
your father has postponed
the wedding for a year 
what happened to you 
i ve fallen in love with a girl
who threw her kerchief to me
from a window and then disappeared 
didn t she say anything 
she just did this 
what could she have meant 
putting her finger in her mouth
means you ve become to her
what the soul is to the body 
two fingers
between her breasts means
 return in two days
to ease my heart  
two days 
aziz 
my god  how awful you look 
you haven t eaten  drunk  or slept 
get up  put on fine garments 
and be happy 
the two days have passed 
hurry and get dressed 
go to her 
may god give wings to your love 
well  aziz 
why didn t you spend
the night with your beloved
and taken the pleasure
you wanted from her 
i wasn t mocking you 
tell me what happened 
no  she didn t appear 
aziz  don t be sad 
you re about to get
what you desire 
she was testing
the sincerity of your love 
you need only return tomorrow night
and sit beneath her window 
your troubles are over 
and now eat or you might die 
love drives a man insane 
he can t eat or sleep 
i know 
these are the signs of love 
  how did it go this time 
  she did this 
what does it mean 
 wait until sunset 
when darkness falls  come 
go to the garden
at the far end of the city 
keep going until you find a lamp 
sit and wait for me there 
my love is almost killing me  
it s not night yet 
rest a while 
you haven t eaten in a week 
how did it go 
i did everything just as you said 
only i dozed off 
when i awoke 
i found these on my stomach 
the coin is her right eye 
the eye one swears by 
the dagger means
she has sworn to kill you
if you behave like that again 
then what must i do 
return to her garden tonight 
but so you don t doze off again 
you must eat and rest now 
lie down and sleep 
i am to die 
wake up  aziz  and eat 
i m not hungry 
come now  eat 
don t act like a child 
this time be sure not to eat
or doze off in the garden 
she will come around dawn 
but i want to give you some advice 
when you leave her 
after you ve done
what you want with her 
recite these lines 
in the name of god
what should a young man do
when love becomes his master  
no  i mustn t touch anything 
aziz  my love 
you waited for me 
did you remember
to recite those lines 
oh  i forgot 
i was looking
at this parchment she gave me 
isn t it beautiful 
may i have it 
certainly  if you like it 
after making love with her tomorrow 
promise to recite those lines
before you leave her 
i promise 
now let me sleep 
i m so sleepy   
  farewell 
  listen 
 in the name of god 
what should a young man do
when love becomes his master  
he must handle it skillfully 
hide his secret 
and be patient
and resigned in all things 
where s aziza 
alone on the terrace  crying 
why 
how can you leave her like this 
without a thought to her suffering 
aziz  did you recite those lines 
yes  and she answered with these 
 he who loves must hide his secret
and be resigned to it  
 he has tried to resign himself
but finds within only a heart
made desperate by passion  
when you leave her
tomorrow morning 
recite those lines to her 
all right 
 he has tried to resign himself 
but finds within only a head
made desperate
by passion  my love  
if he cannot be resigned 
perhaps death is the best answer  
here 
did you recite my lines to her 
yes  and she replied 
 if he cannot be resigned 
perhaps death is the best answer  
 we have heard and obeyed 
so now we die 
say farewell to her
who has hindered my love  
listen 
 we have heard
and obeyed  so now we die 
say farewell to her
who has hindered my love  
my god  the girl who told you
those lines is dead 
if i d known about her 
i wouldn t have drawn you to me 
but she s my cousin 
  did she know we were making love 
  yes 
may god make you weep for your youth
as you ve made her weep for hers 
go now and see her 
how long will this ceremony go on 
we shall pray deep into the night 
as should you  who bear her death
on your conscience 
what did you do to break her heart 
she told me nothing  tell me 
i didn t do anything 
before she died 
she said you should tell that other girl 
 fidelity is good 
but so is frivolity  
i ll tell her 
she left me something to give you 
but only when
you sincerely mourn her death 
show me 
i don t see you sincerely weeping
and moaning over her death 
i have to go now 
i can t wait any longer 
my love 
you were right  she s dead 
we buried her today 
you are to blame 
beware lest you be made to pay 
she left word
that i should tell you this 
 fidelity is good 
but so is frivolity  
with these words she s saved you 
for i d decided to harm you 
harm me  how 
tonight 
before making love to me 
distribute alms for her soul
and have a tomb built
for her of marble 
as they do for a saint 
i shall do as you ask 
go 
wait  aziz 
a bit more perfume 
wait  aziz 
a bit more perfume 
have another glass
of this chilled wine 
to your health 
young man   
read me this letter from my son 
who works far away 
let me have it 
 dear father  i am well 
but i can t earn
a single dinar here 
but god s will be done 
i send my love  your son  ali  
thank you 
now come into my house
for some wine 
it s right here 
  ah  very nice 
would you prefer to die or to live 
  live 
  then marry me 
marry you 
only then will you be safe
from crazy budur 
who s crazy budur 
you ve lived a year with her
and don t know who she is 
ah  the men
she s killed before you 
aziza kept you safe up until now 
but where will you find
another like her 
you re an innocent babe when it comes
to women s perversity  are you not 
it s true 
i want to save you  but not like
your cousin  without compensation 
i m rich 
nothing s lacking in my house 
 no lack of bread in the pantry
or water in the pitcher  
you need only do for me
what the rooster does
for the hen 
  and what s that 
come closer 
you can t get away anyway 
do as you like with me 
i am your slave 
give it all to me 
for my life is yours 
aziz   
it s been a year 
and we ve each kept our promise 
you can go to your mother 
but swear
you ll return before nightfall 
i swear 
budur 
you re waiting for me 
how did you know i d return today 
i didn t 
i ve waited here a year 
day and night  without moving 
i m married and have a son 
i can only stay with you
for one night 
thank you very much 
but if you re married 
what good are you to me now 
but though i don t want you 
i won t let her have you either 
ladies  come out 
help 
 fidelity is good 
but so is frivolity  
aziza has saved you
with her words once again 
but i ll still punish you 
for you deserve it 
get powders for the wound 
what are you doing 
what are you doing 
no  budur  please 
take this 
pull 
aziz  my son 
where have you been 
what have you been doing
all this time 
aziza   
how good you were to me 
how you loved me 
here s what aziza left for you 
yes  aziz   
now i can give it to you 
 this is not the work of budur
but of princess dunya 
know  my love 
that i blame you for nothing 
in fact  i thank god
for letting me die before you 
your aziza  
i searched for princess dunya 
i entered her garden 
i saw her
and fell in love with her 
but what could i do now 
i ve become like a woman 
what s the matter 
let us go to dunya s city 
i ve fallen for her
without ever even seeing her 
help me find her and i ll pay you 
when my father sees
my bloodstained clothes 
he ll think i m dead 
that s dunya s father 
perhaps off to visit another king 
come on  taj 
is the sheik of the market here 
yes  but be careful 
he s one of those
who prefer bananas to figs 
that s him smoking over there 
  greetings  sheik 
  what handsome lads 
it s a shame you re so dirty
from your journey 
before anything else 
you must have a nice bath 
as the poet said 
 may the bath keeper enjoy
a long and happy life 
for his hand gently caresses
a naked body
born of water and light  
you d like to enjoy
their beauty in your bath  eh 
certainly  i m not like
our princess dunya  who hates men
and can t abide
any talk of marriage 
what s that 
hey  are you the gardener here 
yes  why 
may we see the garden 
just a moment 
i ll open the gate 
tell me  to whom
does this garden belong 
dunya  the king s daughter 
the one who hates men
and refuses to marry 
  that s the one  sir 
  why does she hate men 
she dreamed that a pigeon
was caught in a net
and saved by its companion 
but when the dove then got caught 
the pigeon flew off 
and the dove was slaughtered 
she s thought ever since
that all men are like that pigeon 
how much does this dunya pay you 
just one dinar 
listen  i want to create something
beautiful here to be remembered by 
like what  sir 
take these 300 dinars for now 
do as you wish here  gentlemen 
  let s go 
  what are you going to do 
are you looking for work 
i need two laborers 
at your service 
three dinars a day each 
  no  that won t do 
  four 
six 
nine 
we ll only work for you
if you pay us
just one dinar a day each 
are you two brothers 
not blood brothers 
just brothers in god 
why did you become holy men
who wander around living off alms 
to serve god 
tell me what happened
to bring you
to this point 
it will lighten your work
and perhaps teach
this young man something too 
if it magnifies the glory of god 
i ll tell you my story 
thank you for helping me 
i m dying of hunger and thirst 
but i ll reward you 
for i m the son of a king 
bandits attacked us as we carried
gifts to our ally  the king of india 
you d best tell no one of that 
our countries are enemies 
but i ll shelter you 
i ll be no trouble  i can work 
i ll pay for my needs  i ve studied 
i can write and do sums 
i know science and literature 
your learning is worthless here 
money is all people care about here 
you can chop wood
outside the city if you like 
are you man or demon 
i m a man 
  how did you find this place 
  i don t know myself 
perhaps fate meant to put an end
to my sorrow and pain 
who are you  child 
the daughter of a king 
a demon carried me off
and locked me in this tomb 
every ten days he comes
and makes love to me 
if i need him 
i have only to touch the words
engraved on that tablet
and he comes 
my love   
i want to free you from that demon 
you must be mine alone 
i ll take you away from here 
if the demon comes 
he ll answer to me 
run  get away 
he ll be here any minute 
and he ll kill you 
do you know
who these shoes belong to 
no  we ve never seen them before 
i seek the owner of these shoes 
would you know who that is 
no  none of us lost those shoes 
tailor  would you know
the owner of these shoes 
shahzaman   
a stranger found your shoes 
there s your lover 
kill him and you ll be spared 
kill her   
and i ll let you go unharmed 
i can t kill a woman
i ve never seen before
and who s never hurt me 
there s love between you two 
you ve made love with your eyes 
i can t be certain
you ve betrayed me
with her 
i won t kill you 
but neither will you go
unpunished 
i beg you  be merciful 
set me free 
set aside all hope of that 
rise up 
rise up   
you damned monkey 
in the great name of god
and by his power 
become that which your nature
most craves to be 
a monkey 
come here 
come on 
captain   
before we reach port 
an account of our voyage
must be written
on this scroll 
  we overlooked it  sir 
  i ll handle it 
where are you going 
 allow destiny to take its course 
and accept willingly what it brings 
be neither happy nor sad
about anything 
but if you open the inkwell
of power and grace 
be certain your ink is that
of goodness and generosity  
this calligraphy is truly beautiful 
none of my advisors
write in this script so well 
dress the author
in garments of honor
and lead him here in a procession 
ibriza  look 
father  how can you bring
a strange man
to see me 
is what my daughter says true 
you re a man and not a monkey 
is that right 
that s not a monkey but a man 
then i pray you  in god s name 
free him from his present condition 
for i would appoint him vizier 
i shall obey your command 
though it cost me my life 
you are welcome here 
poor monkey 
but your soul was stronger
than your form 
thank you
for giving me back my soul 
she sacrificed her life for me
and was consumed by flames 
my grief
was such that it could
have shattered mountains 
i felt i had offended god 
why would you renounce
your wealth  status  and learning 
not out of generosity
but because of destiny
and as a judgment on humankind 
  god be with you 
  and also with you  stranger 
i wish to entrust you
with a mission as if you were
my oldest friend 
very well  what is it 
god has revealed to me
that at noon tomorrow 
you will come to me
on that island across the gulf
and find me dead near a well 
wash my body and wrap me
in the shroud you ll find beside me 
and bury me 
then take my turban and tunic 
and when someone appears
and asks for them 
give them to him 
  very well 
one  two  three  four   
yunan  my son 
keep your eyes closed
and listen to me 
the see  yunan  the see 
go to your father
and ask permission
go on a sea voyage 
father 
we have islands
across the sea  don t we 
yes  why 
i want to outfit a ship and visit them 
you  set out to sea 
what kind of idea is this 
you  who s afraid even
of taking a bath 
who still plays with children 
and who sleeps all day long 
father  i want to see the world
and travel the sea 
climb the mast
and tell us what you see 
to starboard
the surface is teeming with fish 
straight ahead is a shadow
that s sometimes black
and sometimes white 
we re doomed  we ll all perish 
what s happening 
we re near black stone mountain 
where a copper knight
stands beneath a copper dome 
as long as he stands there 
every ship will be drawn
to the mountain
and smashed on the rocks below 
yunan   
dig beneath your feet 
there you ll find
a copper bow and a lead arrow 
shoot the knight beneath
the dome with your arrow 
send him crashing into the sear
and free the world
of this curse 
stay down there 
don t come out for any reason 
  all right  father 
i ll open this door when i return 
farewell  father 
farewell  my son 
who are you 
what do you want 
go away  don t kill me 
you don t mean to kill me 
you won t kill me  will you 
i m glad you ve calmed down 
i am a king  the son of a king 
and your friend 
i don t mean to kill you 
why would i 
i turn 15 today  and prophets
told my father  the king 
that on this day i would be killed
by a young man with no eyes
who would come from the sea
and free the world
by toppling a great copper knight 
but in exchange
an innocent victim
would have to die   me 
then trust in the goodness
of god and be happy 
i m glad i was shipwrecked
and ended up here to defend you 
for anyone seeking
to harm you will answer to me 
thank you 
i m glad you re my guest here 
even if it s underground 
there s a beautiful bath here 
go inside 
as the poet says 
 happy is the bath boy
whose hand touches
ali s breast and malik s back 
the bath may seem like an inferno 
but it is paradise 
there you ll find bodies
as beautiful as suns and moons  
come 
i too know a poem about the bath 
 a life of joy
for those
who enter the bath waters 
upon them many ponds
pour their ardent tears  
look there   
at that boy lying all alone
on the beach 
perhaps it s yunan  my son 
yes  it s him 
i recognize him 
yunan  my son  it s me  
your father 
god be with you  sir 
did someone leave a tunic with you 
yes  sir 
give it to me 
what s happening 
farewell  father 
where are you going  my son 
dunya  look there  in the house 
look how beautiful 
who could have decorated
the ceiling 
it s beautiful  dunya 
i don t understand 
this is the story from my dream 
yes  the dove there
is caught in the net 
but there s something here
that wasn t in your dream 
the pigeon you thought
flew off like a coward
was caught and killed
by a bird of prey 
sometimes dreams
are poor teachers 
because the whole truth
never lies in one dream   
but in many 
look here carefully  slave 
and make no mistake 
what s this called 
tell me 
  then it s called your pigeon 
  wrong 
then you tell me 
it s called
perfumed meadow grass 
thank god
for perfumed meadow grass 
now it s my turn  come here 
what s this called 
look carefully 
don t make a mistake 
perfumed meadow grass 
wrong  stupid 
then what s it called 
peeled pomegranate 
you re not done yet 
what s this called 
look carefully 
don t get it wrong again 
  peeled pomegranate 
  idiot  that s wrong 
then what is it 
the inn of good fare 
really 
and what s this called 
look carefully  no mistakes 
  which of you knows 
  i do 
then tell us 
this is the donkey
that grazes
on perfumed meadow grass 
eats peeled pomegranates   
and spends the night
in the inn of good fare 
zumurrud 
tear me to pieces if you like 
i m tired of wandering and searching 
i had the most beautiful slave
in the world  and i lost her 
come  lion 
kill me  eat me 
then my suffering will be over 
what is it 
what do you want 
i don t understand 
am i to follow you 
all right  i m coming 
stop 
it s dangerous
to eat from that dish 
others who ate that rice
were killed 
let him eat 
we ll see what happens 
let me eat 
if i m killed  it will end my suffering 
  what is your name 
  nur ed din 
dress and perfume this nur ed din
and bring him to my chambers 
far from killing him 
our king s treating him very hospitably 
the king must have noticed
his beautiful eyes 
one needn t wonder 
our king may well prefer
melons to plums 
i d have that boy too  my friends 
come here and massage my legs 
come on 
higher 
i ll go no higher than your knees 
what  you d refuse
to do as i command 
beware 
i ll make it very clear 
you must do as i say  boy 
i want you as my lover 
perhaps as a reward
i ll make you an emir 
  what do i have to do 
  go lie on the bed 
i ve never done this before  take back
your presents and let me leave 
obey me 
now go lie on the bed 
or shall i have you beheaded 
on your stomach 
pull your pants down 
hurry up 
please don t hurt me too much 
do you like love poems 
haven t you ever heard one 
don t look at me 
now listen 
 the fuzzy down of a first beard
has traced  like a poet s pen 
two lines in myrtle
on a young boy s cheeks 
the sun and moon marvel
when he appears 
no tree has ever yielded
so sweetly to the storm  
fine 
you know this other one 
don t look at me 
 l spoke of mounting him 
and he replied 
 will you never stop insulting me  
but when i showed him a dinar 
that handsome youth said 
 if destiny says
you are to mount me 
i can t escape it   
and how about this other one 
don t look at me 
 my love is great 
and that handsome youth said to me 
 push that thing in deep
with all your might   
isn t it getting hard 
not unless you touch it 
go on  touch it 
you know what awaits
if you don t obey 
come on 
you re like a woman down there 
and now mine
is standing up straight 
my love  don t you recognize
your slave 
zumurrud  my love 
you know
