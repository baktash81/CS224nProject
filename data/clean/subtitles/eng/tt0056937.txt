met in bloody civil war
and caesars legions
destroyed those of the great pompey
so that now only caesar
stood at the head of rome
but there was no joy for caesar
as in his other triumphs
for the dead which his legions
counted and buried and burned
were their own countrymen
the smoke of burning roman dead
is just as black
and the stink no less
it was pompey not i
who wanted it so
let what i have said be set down
you may stand
do not try and impress me by looking
either too penitent or too proud
as field officers
you fought miserably for pompey
men under your command will be
permitted to enlist in my legions
and returned to rome as romans
you shall have the same privilege
im not magnanimous your names
are marked youll be watched
first sign of treachery
youll be killed
what is it flavius antony
oh yes canidius
with news of pompey i hope
hail caesar
drink that in my name canidius
to all marc antonys cavalry
caesars left wing and right arm
what news of pompey or whats left
pompeys gone caesar
slipped through our fingers
disguised as a peddler
leaving most of his merchandise
gone where
he has a galley waiting at the coast
provision enough for egypt they say
egypt possibly
they owe him a great deal
hell ask for sanctuary
borrow money borrow time
i thought it was over
it seems its not
rufio consult the augurers
i want to know
in egypt will pompey face me at last
but surely caesar will now
return to rome
i must go to egypt in any case
king ptolemy and his sister
have a civil war of their own
intent on destroying each other
and in the process romes wheat
that cannot be so urgent
let the romans welcome
great caesar properly at last
in this greatest of his triumphs
triumph over what
over whom
canidius
caesar
leave me the 10th and 12th
antonys to take the rest to rome
when can he start
whenever you say
then at once
and in rome
marc antony is to speak for caesar
his authority is not to be questioned
his word will be yours
as always caesars word is law
of course
but remind him to keep his legions
intact they make the law legal
caesar
and even as caesars galleys
sailed the great sea to egypt
it was happening that
just as the romans
so the egyptians made war
one upon the other
for king ptolemy would no longer
share the throne
with his sister cleopatra
but drove her
from the city of alexandria
and sought to destroy her
weve arrived on their market day
once a week theyre allowed
in the royal enclosure
wheres the guard of honor for caesar
some representative
of the royal or military
we have the privilege of watching
caesar battle through our marketplace
marcellus a dozen frontrank men
swords only
clear a direct line
to the palace steps
then as many more to keep it open
its precisely what they hope wed do
manhandle their people
no this is their market day
we will go marketing
youre not serious
well shop our way to the palace
have you my money
everything is to be paid for by coin
tell them to put away the swords
and carry moneybags
olives oil of olives
ah the wine of samos
how much for your wine four drachma
sixty of your wine for my men
pay him
pay him
you said theyd push the people
and make them angry
why arent they doing
what you said theyd do
your king has asked a question
lord chamberlain
the romans have degenerated minds
most high majesty
they do the unexpected
particularly one roman
master of the unexpected
but with so few men
you all look so impressive
any one of you could be king
his divine majesty my lord ptolemy
iord of the upper
and lower regions
son of ra of horus and of thoth
beloved of
et cetera et cetera you welcome me
and i gaius julius caesar
pontifex maximus
et cetera et cetera thank you
from the senate and people
of rome hail king ptolemy
and his sister and coruler
queen cleopatra
they wont tell you so
but cleopatras dead
she tried to kill me
and we chased her into the desert
and there she died
whereas it is true
that his majestys sister
repeatedly plotted
to have him killed
it is not true
that cleopatra is dead
whereas it is true that she
fled from alexandria
i seem to always interrupt you
but the search for truth
can go on and on
pothinus is it not
lord chamberlain and chief eunuch
to king ptolemy an exalted rank
obtained not without certain
shall we say sacrifice
theodotus am i right
tutor to his majesty in history
philosophy and ambition
and achillas
they say youre a good soldier
as one to another where is cleopatra
with her army
and how many of your men
between her and alexandria
enough
may i speak
surely you have come in peace
and we present ourselves to you
in warm and respectful welcome
our only problem being an
internal one of concern only to us
why have you come caesar
as we all know when the father
of both ptolemy and cleopatra died
he named the two of them
to rule jointly over egypt
rome was appointed their guardian
and the executor of his will
i have come in the name of rome to ask
why cleopatra has been deposed
to resolve the differences
between her and king ptolemy
and to see that they peacefully
resume their joint rule of egypt
that will be difficult
cleopatra has forfeited her right
i shall try to decide justly
dont you see hell send for her
hell bring her back
the sun which sheds its grace
upon the ruler of the two lands
burns too brightly perhaps
if lord ptolemy wishes to retire
i wish nothing of the kind
i wont be put out of the way
until ive watched you give him that
a thousand pardons
i had almost forgotten
lord ptolemy wishes to enhance his
welcome by a gift of some importance
most generous
the ring give him pompeys ring
and now the token of
his majestys affection for rome
and regard for caesar
pompey the great
dead men they say do not bite
does it please you caesar
they said it would
please you very much
the sun does shed its grace
too brightly
it has become too hot here for kings
my lord ptolemy will retire
for his majesty
a roman guard of honor
it was not by your hand of course
lf as you say youve been told
of me you know better caesar
my men shall be
properly housed and fed
may i speak
not until youre spoken to
ill require rooms in the palace
i shall consider myself
honored to escort you
anyone but you
find the rest of pompey
tear out a thousand tongues
but find him
have him purified
the coin in the mouth
and the rest honorably
of course
for now this is what we must hold
moon gate and three others
here here and here
how are we placed
the 10th slingers on the moon gate
the rest in reserve
the 12th holding all other positions
very thin
for now deep enough
and the wells
the waters brackish but drinkable
so far keep an eye on them
watch the corn and wheat
with our supplies secure
we can hold indefinitely
for a week perhaps
but for the time being time enough
what do you want
is the man to be trusted
seems someones brought me a gift
from queen cleopatra
apparently a rug peddler
flavius doubts it
he seems to know the palace very well
he appeared through a secret passage
which none of the men knew
pothinus might send an assassin
in cleopatras name
have the man brought in
are you the one
who brings a gift from cleopatra
put it down and go
it is the command of my queen
i deliver her gift personally
i am caesar lay it here before me
forgive me admiral agrippa
but youre not caesar
nor you general rufio
nor you germanicus
my queens gift is for
the eyes of caesar
alone
it seems harmless enough
no caesar
you can lend me your sword rufio
it may require some cutting
odd way to carry a rug
isnt it easier
to sling it over your shoulder
it was less comfortable that way
for you or the rug
that sword caesar
the rug is such a delicate weave
if i may untie it for you
turn it over first
the rug is rightside up
i want it the wrong side up
should i flip it over with my sword
no
i find one can tell more
about the quality of merchandise
by examining the back side first
all hail cleopatra
kindred of horus and ra
beloved of the moon and sun
daughter to isis
and of upper and lower egypt
queen
thank you
here
take this to the captain
of the night watch
hell see the queens quarters
are made ready to her
stay where you are
have i dismissed you
no your majesty
this is my palace caesar
all of it
is available to me at my will
i am not your prisoner
if anything you are my guest
most kind
and as for having my quarters
as you put it made ready
my chief handmaiden has by now
brought the others out of hiding
they should almost be finished
impossible
the doors are under guard
there are doors and doors
of course
you must take me on a tour someday
within the walls of your palace
what are you waiting for
permission to leave
granted
apollodorus
thank you
im pleased you received my summons
and were able to
summons im pleased to say
i received nothing of the kind
im surprised you thought
i would answer one
young lady the voyage
in your carpet
has apparently not tired you
but im exhausted
caesar it is essential
we understand each other
only through me
can you hope to escape
the desperate situation
in which you find yourself
i wouldnt bite into that
did you bring it with you
have you had it tasted
if neither its probably poisoned
at least its another way out of the
desperate situation in which im found
youre being tolerant of me
arent you
is it because youre so much older
your maps are inferior
outofdate compared to mine
they and i have aged together
the lakes to the west
are poorly marked
certain important hill positions
not even noted
i must arrange for you to address
my mapmakers and general staff
weve gotten off to a bad start
havent we
ive rubbed you the wrong way
im not sure i want to be
rubbed by you at all young lady
it is permissible
for me to sit is it not
as quickly as possible you must
set me alone on the throne of egypt
my mission is to put to an end
to your tiresome squabbling
youre not a fool or are you
immodestly perhaps no
youve seen my brother
and listened to him
and that truly evil man
to whom he belongs
yes
shall we agree upon what rome
really wants
has always wanted of egypt
corn grain treasure
its the old story
roman greatness built
upon egyptian riches
you shall have them
you shall have them all and in peace
but there is only one way
my way make me queen
that sounds very much
like an ultimatum
there is no other way
for one whose assets
up to a few moments ago
was a devoted slave
and a rolledup carpet
but i have you now caesar
besides there are my armies
and the simple fact that
no mortal hand can destroy me
yes i recall some
mention of an obsession
you have about your divinity
isis is it not
i shall have to insist
that you mind what you say
i am isis i am worshiped
by millions who believe it
do not confuse what i am
with the socalled divine origin
that every roman general acquires
together with his shield
it was venus you chose to be
descended from wasnt it
i must now do a little
insisting of my own
the journey has tired you
and you wish to retire
i am not your servant caesar
do not dismiss me
secondly you have no armies
young lady
they are gone because
you could not pay them
egypts riches are not
available for your use
much less to give away
perhaps in a day or two
we can speak again
that may be too late
for both of us
your safety will be
my responsibility
and what about your own
i am prepared i believe
for the time being
i hope so
i hope you are as wise
as brilliant
the god they say you are
you roman generals
become divine so quickly
a few victories a few massacres
only yesterday pompey was a god
they murdered him didnt they
yes
because they thought
it would please you
it didnt did it
no
today i found myself remembering
how much my daughter loved him
she died trying
to bear him a son
gave him this ring
sleep well tonight caesar
these next days may
be difficult for you
good night
germanicus a guard to escort
queen cleopatra to her apartments
guards
the corridors are dark gentlemen
but you mustnt be afraid
havent we covered everything
we can tonight sir
perhaps a fresh start in the morning
no a few more matters
rufio has it occurred to you
that our maps of this area
are not quite what they should be
why no what makes you
think theyre not
i have an instinct about these things
actually of macedonian descent
no officially admitted egyptian blood
reputed to be extremely intelligent
and sharp of wit
queen cleopatra is widely read
wellversed in the sciences
and mathematics
she speaks seven languages
proficiently
were she not a woman shed be
considered an intellectual
nothing bores me so much
as an intellectual
makes a better admiral of you
agrippa
heres something
of more interest to the navy
in obtaining her objectives she has
been known to use torture poison
and even her own sexual talents
which are said to be considerable
her lovers i am told are listed
more easily by number than by name
it is said that she chooses
in the manner of a man
rather than wait to be chosen
in womanly fashion
well theres more reason
than we thought
for not wanting to leave
you two alone eh sir
im sorry i wasnt listening
are you inclined to trust cleopatra
trust not for a minute
trust  the word has always
made me apprehensive
like wine whenever ive tried it
the aftereffects have not been good
so ive given up wine
and trusting
oh its been a long
and difficult day gentlemen
the next few may be even longer
and more difficult
good night
good night
flavius
flavius
it is autumn again
my bestloved lesbia
look the torrents of roman leaves
are falling falling
and lovers revive in kisses
the promise of spring
which will end the winter world
with new nightingales calling
i taste your food daughter of isis
and if there be harm in it
let the harm fall upon me
but love must bring
despair one day
as beauty sorrow
why do you stop phoebus
in the corridor there is movement
thats how the romans
frighten the enemy
by stamping their elephant feet
no this is one man
followed by others
caesar i would say
would you
we must not disappoint
the mighty caesar
the romans tell fabulous tales
of my bath
and handmaidens
and my morals
cleopatras requested my presence
that was yesterday caesar
ive been occupied
the queen is occupied with her bath
perhaps caesar could return later
or tomorrow
im afraid not hold him
no dont hurt him
youre a good man apollodorus
i hope youre appreciated
wait here for me
ah then let us live and love
without one thought
for the gossip of virgins
now grown old and stale
suns go down and may return
but once put out
our own brief light
we sleep through
one eternal night
an intruder a man
oh its you
you wanted to see me
i summoned you yesterday
to an audience in my throne room
i was told i was not
permitted to go there
its too close to the quarters
occupied by your brother and the rest
i will not be told where
i can go and where i cannot go
since theres nothing you want
except my throne
at least youve dressed
properly for my presence
your best armor
almost but im afraid
its not being worn in your honor
i know
this morning you paid a formal
visit to the tomb of alexander
you remained alone beside
the sarcophagus for some time
id like to know
how you know
just staring down at him
and then you cried
why did you cry caesar
that man recites beautifully
is he blind
dont you hurt him
i wont not anyone
who speaks catullus so well
catullus doesnt approve of you
why havent you had him killed
because i approve of him
my desire to please you
caesar is very slight
nor do i greatly care to know
if you are black or white
achillas is moving
his entire army to alexandria
by tonight hell outnumber you
20to1 30to1
hell have the royal enclosure
entirely surrounded
except to the sea
do you plan to sail away
great caesar
not for the time being
achillas may attack tomorrow
the next day
whenever it suits him
very probable
in your wildest dreams caesar
how can you possibly hope to hold
the gates of this enclosure
against such odds
and if you say once more
for the time being
my officers say anything
from a week to indefinitely
what would you estimate
before youre without water
without food
your troops slaughtered
picked off from the rooftops
poisoned in the brothels
a few days caesar
at the most a few days
im inclined to agree with you
young man do you know this
of catullus
give me a thousand
and a thousand kisses
when we have many more
well scramble them
and forget the score
so evil envy will not know
how high the count
and cast its evil eye
it couldnt have been
as pleasant in the throne room
my desire to please you caesar
is very slight
be still
caesar a word its important
the egyptian galleys in the harbor
have been taking on men and armaments
when will they be prepared
tomorrow with the morning wind
burn them tonight
their ships lie close to shore
the fire may spread to the city
lets hope it doesnt
i cant risk a blockade
remember not before tonight
prepare as secretly as possible
i need this day
good luck
why not before tonight my lord
why does caesar need this day
i cant give you that information
for the time being
flavius
here it is caesar just arrived
the gods shouldnt
tantalize us so rufio
its even better than id hoped
be on your way you havent much time
hail caesar
its called an epilepse because of the
arching caused by muscular spasms
the contortions
the early greeks considered
those who suffered from it
to be favored by the gods
the great alexander they say
had this falling sickness
and so they say
the mighty caesar too
your majesty forgive me
sosigenes the library
what are you saying
the romans set fire
to the egyptian fleet
its about time
come see for yourself
the fires spread to the city
the city
just a few buildings
but the library is burning
the great library
aristotles manuscripts
the platonic commentaries
the plays the histories
the testament of the hebrew god
the book of books
wind blew into the merchant shipping
four burned and sank right here
and our ships
safe and dry
prisoners are surrendering in droves
i need help
not one man i may need your sailors
halt
take your hands off me
you should attack my guards more
often battle seems to become you
you grow more beautiful
each time i see you
and you grow bolder
and busier
actually were extremely busy
do you smell smoke
we found it necessary
to burn the egyptian fleet
the ships were in the water
did you find it necessary
to burn them in the streets
merchant ships caught fire
the burning masts fell
some houses
one of them the great
library of alexandria
yes ive been told
im extremely sorry
now if you dont mind i must ask
i do mind
are you putting the fire out
were forming prisoners
into fire brigades
oh i see romans only start fires
is that it
have you left the nursery
to come irritate the adults
another time were working
shall we remove her for you caesar
use roman genius for destruction
tear down pyramids wipe out cities
how dare you and the rest of your
barbarians set fire to my library
play conqueror all you want
mighty caesar
rape murder pillage thousands
millions of human beings
but neither you nor
any other barbarian
has the right to destroy
one human thought
enough
leave me alone with her
i will send for you when i finish
it wont be long
swords javelins
or are you going to set me on fire
the time has come for us
to understand each other
whatever else i may be in your
opinion first of all i am caesar
and i am cleopatra
queen daughter of isis
if i say so and when i say so
you are what i say you are
nothing more
hail caesar
you descendant of inbred generations
of incestuous mental defectives
how dare you call me barbarian
barbarian
daughter of a drunkard who
bribed his way to the throne
your price was too high remember
ive had enough of you pretenders
parading on ruins of past glories
only the future concerns me
keep out of my affairs do as i say
do as you say
literally
as if i were something
you had conquered
if i choose to regard you as such
am i to understand that youre free
to do with me whatever you want
whenever you want
yes i want that understood
wont you at least wear
your laurel wreath
so i can be reminded its
the divine caesar that honors me so
you talk too much
i promise you
you wont like me this way
caesar an attack on the moon gate
the moon gate
an attack in force
those ballistas need eliminating
send out a turtle
form the turtle
now is the time for us to attack
no
we have a full legion in reserve
we hold our positions here
two hours till dawn
well hold where we are
and what happens at dawn
i thought you knew
the sun comes up
tell the men theyve won
liberty and wine
for defenders of the gate
all reserves cavalry every man
available move out behind achillas
we have him in a vise
what is the other half
rufio and the armies of mithradates
he went out last night
mithradates how could
he get here this fast
i sent him when we sailed for egypt
no general in his right mind can
hold alexandria with two legions
as you and others have repeatedly
pointed out to me
i taste your drink
daughter of isis
and if there be harm in it
let the harm fall upon me
lotus
you wiped the rim of the cup
after you tasted it why
why so my mouth would not soil it
lotus
taste it again
pothinus said he would have me killed
forgive me majesty
forgive me forgive me
i forgive you
now drink it
apollodorus
apollodorus
great silence
for gaius julius caesar
senate consul of the people
of rome
you will all stand
let what is said be recorded
as the judgment and decree
of the senate and people of rome
there is no judgment here
and the decree not romes
but cleopatras
she has lied to you caesar
she and her slaves lie to you
you have not been accused pothinus
thus far
you are now charged with inciting and
abetting war against the roman army
and plotting to assassinate
queen cleopatra
you are guilty of both
you are sentenced to death
its too bright in here
shut out some of the sun
are you going to kill me too caesar
what am i accused of
king ptolemy is hereby removed
from the protective custody of rome
hell leave within the hour
and be conducted safely
to the camp of achillas
achillas youre going to send me
back to my own troops
he is to be accompanied
by his learned tutor theodotus
do you hear that
youll be saved along with me
stop grinning you little idiot
may i speak
you know that achillas is trapped
between your own legions
and the armies of mithradates
to send his majesty to fight
may mean his death
an occupational hazard
for those who are king
but then certainly not i caesar
im no king nor general
what do i know of war
a simple scholar
a man of thoughts and words
too many words enough
let all be done properly as decreed
flavius
find apollodorus
return his dagger to him
you might clean it first
it has pothinus all over it
yes yes i know im tired
i promise ill sleep
you have my apologies
for what almost happened to you
caesar will you talk with me
for just a minute
yesterday was full
tonight was long
this morning has not been uneventful
did you know that apollodorus
would kill pothinus
he was kind enough to wait until rome
had passed sentence of death
and my brother
and theodotus
they too will be killed possibly
probably
your majesty im truly weary
you knew all along didnt you
that there was no real danger
that mithradates was on his way
to reinforce you
why didnt you tell me
you wouldnt believe me
i really must insist
i wouldve believed you
you didnt trust me
not for an instant
and yet in these last few minutes
you have made me undisputed queen
the sole ruler of egypt why
perhaps tomorrow we could talk
why caesar
it was best for rome
best for egypt
for egypt too
cleopatra get out
i beg of you get out
that will not be needed
it wasnt necessary
for me to betray myself
i could have
called out for flavius
how many new spyholes
have you dug in the walls
are we being watched
even now
if you see flavius
you might send him to me
still trying to dismiss me
what is it you want
what more do you want
to be of help to you
there never has been help
there never will be
now there is
one day itll happen
where i cannot hide
where the world will see me fall
i shall tumble down before the mob
and foam at the mouth
and make them laugh
and theyll tear me to pieces
the gods themselves had your sickness
hannibal even the great alexander
and in the end they fell
were torn to pieces by the mob
not you
i will see to that
in the name of the senate and the
people of rome and by their will
isis herself would surrender her place
in heaven to be as beautiful as you
youre not supposed
to look at me no one is
if they arent looking
how do they know i am
you should be kneeling
would that do
before all these visiting kings
making believe
theyre not watching us
you have such bony knees
not only bony but unaccustomed
to this sort of thing
if were to get an early start
in the morning
what will it be tomorrow
more wheat
what ive seen could feed
more legions than rome ever had
theres enough to feed the world
more gold then
why not buy the world
surely you have enough
at least enough to pay more legions
than even rome has ever had
more granite more marble
more millions of slaves
to build whatever needs building
better routes to india
shorter routes to the east
what can there be in egypt
that i havent seen
egypt itself the reason for egypt
my responsibility is rome
alexander understood it
that from egypt
he could rule the world
he was very young
and you even younger
at your age such dreams have a
reality which grows less in time
caesar no longer dreams
dangerous to a man of my calling
necessary i would have thought
i cant stay away from rome too long
there are problems
messages from marc antony
endlessly demanding my return
and on my way back wars
to be fought in the east and north
even in rome itself
im not without opposition
do to them
what you did to achillas
this is opposition
of a different sort
they weave it cleverly lightly
like a cobweb
you know what happens when cobwebs
are not regularly swept away
do you trust this marc antony
if anyone in the world
i trust antony
let him brush away the cobwebs
for you and stay with me
youve been declared
dictator for a year
you can do what you want
with your time
everything but make it stand still
if when you return to rome
these wars that have to be fought
on the way are they important
well theres no such thing
as an unimportant war
ive been reading in your commentaries
about your campaigns in gaul
how does my writing
compare with catullus
well its different
dull
perhaps a little
too much description
youre being tactful
some of my critics brutus for one
tell me my latin is not only
ungrammatical but common
you spared his life more than once
people say its because
brutus is your son
is that true
i have no son
calpurnia your third wife
fourth
married to you how long
12 years
and still caesar has no son
no child at all
it is wellknown that
calpurnia is barren
a woman who cannot bear children
is like a river that is dry
i see no purpose in discussing
the subject further
a woman too must make
the barren land fruitful
she must make life grow
where there was no life
just as the mother nile feeds
and replenishes the earth
i am the nile
i will bear many sons
isis has told me
my breasts are filled
with love and life
my hips are rounded
and well apart
such women they say
have sons
that first time
when you stood here alone
why did you cry
will you tell me now
because i had lost something
what
a lifetime
mine
nonsense
having conquered the world
he died at 32
i am 52
my remaining ambition is to keep
the world from conquering me
your ambitions
must always have been his
they still must be
shall i tell you something
when i was 32 in spain
i came upon a statue of alexander
i wept then too
even then
i want you to have his sword
to take back with you
too deeply embedded
it can be removed
its buried in time
and alexanders mantle
too heavy for caesar
his dream then
make his dream yours caesar
his grand design
pick it up where he left off
out of the patchwork of conquests
one world
and out of one world one nation
one people on earth living in peace
so you have told me at last
what it is you want of me
of us
at the center the capital of this
world one people one nation
alexandria
he chose it
i am roman
he was greek what will it matter
when were all one people
i am 52 he was 32 and failed
we will succeed
your dreams your ambitions
one lifetime is not enough
for such dreams such ambitions
the cloak of alexander
cannot be too heavy
for rome and egypt
to carry together
and what if his sword
is too deeply embedded
yours will replace it caesar
you have a way of mixing
politics and passion
where does one begin
and the other leave off
that did not start
nor will it end with me
cleopatra whatever it is
however it comes out
leave me my destiny
your destiny
is no longer just yours
its mine too
soon there will be someone to
carry both the cloak of alexander
and the sword of caesar
and the name of caesar
and in that name he will rule egypt
and whatever part or all
of the world that we give him
our child
will be a son for you caesar
by isis i swear it
could you put off
your return to rome
just long enough
i came as quickly as i could
antony is welcome to caesars house
as often and as quickly as he likes
as caesars wife before truth
is distorted into vicious gossip
i wanted you to hear
that my husband has married cleopatra
theres some fresh wine
one of your many favorites
the ceremony according to vicious
gossip was in the egyptian religion
even if true that cant be
taken seriously
during which he was formally
declared an egyptian god
officially divine at last
that must have pleased caesar
calpurnia we know caesar you and i
this socalled marriage
has no validity under roman law
there must be political purpose
perhaps a symbolic ceremony
to ratify our bond with egypt
perhaps merely
indulging some barbaric custom
youve been loyal and kind
you came as quickly
as you could
unhappily vicious gossip
travels even faster than you
and the truth
have you heard for instance that
cleopatra is carrying caesars child
yes antony
we know him
you and i
there shall be
there shall be
rome
mighty and alone and unloved
a mistress
a mistress shall raise thee again
from earth to heaven
and all the world shall know
a golden age of justice and of love
a son shall be born to isis
a son shall be born to isis
rome shall know him in cloth of gold
the east shall see him laden
with jewels and treasure
a son of egypt and of rome
here shall he find his destiny
do exactly as i tell you
when the child is born
after he is anointed
and named royal prince
take him to caesar
bring caesar here
no exactly as i tell you
take the child to caesar
in front of his men
do you understand
in front of all the romans
lay him at caesars feet
at caesars feet
i will do just as you say
fear not
we have never lost a caesar
that remark was insubordinate
and in bad taste
caesar remember roman law
if you pick up this child
you acknowledge its yours
and a citizen of rome
as your heir
a son
i have a son
hail caesar
hail caesar
hes been made king of egypt
they have named their bastard
caesarion
prince caesarion
what better name for the heir
to the throne of rome
there is no throne of rome
nor shall there be
nor would caesar tolerate one
but a son
we know how much hes wanted one
i am happy for caesar
your happiness
is understandable enough
now that caesar has
publicly recognized a son
one need no longer
wonder about brutus
is it a relief not to be
wondered about casca
to be known openly
as you are for what you are
liar swindler bully and coward
brutus youll turn cascas head
with your flattery
and cascas head if turned
will see marc antony
a part of caesar more to be feared
than his infant son
but it is for the good of rome that
caesar has stayed so long in egypt
in his absence the people
have come to worship him as a god
why should he return to show himself
as mortal as the rest
there are those
who fear caesars ambition
but what is to fear
that he will destroy the republic
yes he will
i promise you he will
your tongue is old but sharp cicero
be careful how you waggle it
it may cut off your head
it will more likely
be your sword antony
tis just as sharp and quicker
and frightened of heads
therell be a strong smell
of wine in the senate today
we must breathe with restraint
octavian this whats his name
this son of caesar
does it upset you
no
you run off at the mouth so
one thinks your words
are as precious as your gold
like my gold i use them
where they are worth most
and your virtue
my friend has a friend
that too
you know its quite possible
that when you die
you will die without
ever having been alive
i cant leave without saying
goodbye to my son and to you
we thought your son and i
that if we came to you
we would have those
few minutes more
a good thing to remember my son
what you will not let go
no one will take from you
hail and farewell little caesar
was it a century ago when i was dropped
at your feet wrapped in a carpet
or was it last night
when will you send for us when
soon
how soon when
so much time must go by
before even i reach rome
and then how soon
within reasonable time
time is never reasonable
time is our enemy caesar
am i to conquer it for you
what plan of battle do you suggest
i must bring your son to rome
rome must see caesars son
who will one day rule
over caesars world
caesar
im afraid the tides
will soon be against you
not only time but the tides
even as divinities there seems
little we can do about either
but only after more than two years
and many wars
in africa and asia minor
was caesar able to cross over
to italy and come home at last
to celebrate his triumphs
and see to his affairs
in recognition the senate
has bestowed upon caesar
the rank privilege and title
of dictator of rome for life
dictator for life
at long last he is master of rome
apollodorus
everything must be made ready at once
ships servants
we are prepared
surely now nothing
can prevent his sending for us
if only to attend
his coronation as he did mine
your majesty
three long wasted years
why should the senate
have taken so long
to recognize what the world
has already known
that caesar was master of rome
rufio wishes to speak
your majesty seems to misunderstand
it seems quite clear caesar has been
declared dictator of rome for life
true but there is a vast difference
between dictator and master
no man can call himself
master of rome
why not
it has a meaning far too close
to a word no roman will tolerate
king
and to be dictator of rome for life
is to be granted the lifelong respect
and honor of the roman people
and the dictates of the dictator
must in each case of course
be approved by the senate of rome
thank you rufio
the enemy the enemy the enemy
sosigenes
you must think it odd that i propose
an invitation to queen cleopatra
do you
egypt after all has been
officially declared ally of rome
still i confess i was surprised
at some of those who voted in favor
were you
may i express my gratitude for being
permitted to visit todays session
it was truly inspiring
to witness the free will
of free men so fearlessly expressed
he seemed most anxious to be present
i saw no harm in granting permission
didnt you
after today never again shall i
doubt the extent of egypts wealth
i dont like ciceros implication
theres not enough gold in egypt
to buy a roman senator
more than enough it seems
to buy his vote
how was it now
rome will know him in cloth of gold
by reports the reception
in the streets is extraordinary
the queen has instructed
the procession to move slowly
for the peoples enjoyment
i might almost believe cleopatra set
out to capture the citizens of rome
one would have every reason
for believing exactly that
nothing like this has come
into rome since romulus and remus
how unafraid he is
how unafraid he is
your queen has conquered
the people of rome
the people yes
now then walk like a king
head up
listen to them cheer
take your throne
bow to the right left
now an angry glance at someone
whos displeased you
very good i tremble
see me tremble
no dont smile
not when theyre trembling
it makes them stop
now the prisoners
are dragged before you one by one
this one has no power anywhere
therefore means nothing
but you wish to be known
as a noble ruler what do you say
i pardon you
louder you pardon somebody
you want it known
i pardon you
ah now who comes here
once your friend you trusted him
and he turned against you
he has power wealth and family
he kneels
he begs you to be his friend again
to have you trust him again
and then what then little king
caesar must wish
what needs commanding
to drain the pontine marshes
to free rome from malaria
to fill my belly
to control the tibers floods
to improve the harbor at ostia
to please my ambition
and must i wish roads to be built
libraries for public use
the men of italy to be equal
to those of rome
many of these have merits
and merit our approval
merit your approval  is caesar
to come before the senate each day
like a schoolboy
now passing now failing
do you suggest the senate no longer
deliberate the welfare of rome
to end the process of roman law
i must be the law and my word
must be the welfare of rome
else take from me
this meaningless title of dictator
ive carried a sword for too long
i cannot now pretend
with an empty scabbard
surely caesar recalls the symbolic
nature of the title dictator
at the time it was conferred
it was to honor caesar
above all men
and to indicate romes gratitude
for your triumphs in its name
brutus i recall them well
those triumphs
do you
pharsalia for one
you trembled in antonys hand
when he was hot
to separate you from your head
with just cause
my command spared your life
there was no deliberating body
it was not my wish but my command
by my dictate that you stand here
dribbling virtue out of your mouth
sit down
no i want no more meaningless
privileges and considerations
no more honors designed to pacify me
i would rather have nothing
remain what i am at heart
a humble man anxious only to serve
why are the eyes of a statue
always without life
have any of you here seen the nile
spare yourselves the journey
she carries it within her eyes
i suggest caesar
that the hour is late
very late for rome
i was speaking cassius i was
now where was i
anxious to serve
yes ive served
served for all of my life
ive won for rome
more than half of the world
most of you owe your honors
and fortunes to me
and now i want you to do as i say
you will appoint me
emperor of rome
there is no need to resume your seats
on behalf of all thank you
majesty for your hospitality
good night
thank you and good night
they resent being summoned here for
meetings properly held in the senate
resent it do they
i cannot understand
that the eyes of a statue
should be always without life
they resent me
to flaunt me like this
theyll use it to keep from you
that which is yours
by divine right is that not so
yes it is
by divine right
we shall have the senate
in its deliberations deliberate that
are you quite sure
what it is you want
so desperately
ive always been sure
and caesar
does anyone speak for him
no
good night
tell me brutus is it proper
to stand before this goddess
caesars set here in the temple
or must we as romans kneel
not yet see there where room
has been left for another deity
when the god caesar stands beside the
goddess cleopatra
then rome will crawl before them
when that day comes if it comes
he demanded we make him emperor
only once and it was his sickness
his sickness grows worse
soon it will kill us
he asked once to be made emperor
but hes since decreed himself god
emperor and god no longer just king
but emperor and god
brutus open your eyes
what do you want of me
when the people think
upon the honor of rome
they think upon one man
brutus
by that honor and
by the responsibility you carry
brutus save rome from caesar
you cannot ask me to destroy him
then let caesar destroy rome
antony has just come from a meeting
of my friends with good news
tomorrow at the senate lucius cotta
will move that i be made king
it will pass
but i dont understand
king and emperor
and it will pass
the last few months
ive been enjoying
one of the few privileges
of being dictator
i have been appointing senators
slightly more than half the senate
has been appointed by me
once again the army of mithradates
on its way all the time
it will pass
tomorrow the ides of march
a day to be remembered
the senate will declare me
king of rome
king yes but not of rome
not of rome what are you saying
theyll offer you king
of the roman empire outside italy
theyre afraid caesar
even your friends
afraid of the people
perhaps in time
to be afraid of the people
to waste time on the people
king of all but rome
what is there the huts of gaul
the caves of britain
the whole of the empire outside italy
i will not accept
they mean it to be an empty gesture
another title to please your fancy
flatter your ego
nothing more
and it will pass
then accept it caesar
i have never settled
for half a victory
nor will you now
caesar mighty caesar
all i can say
is what youve taught me
take a little then a little more
until finally you have it all
let them declare you king
even if its only
of a tree in asia minor
the rest will come to you
to redo once more everything
i have already done
its what you have never done what
you never conquered that waits for you
the great legions of rome in the outer
empire that will become your legions
the gold the power of egypt
your egypt
caesar you can conquer
and hold the world as your own
wont you understand
kings are not elected
gods are not elected
why not only rome but all of italy
upon which rome stands
must fall in your hands
like a drop of sweat
let them make you what they choose
ill serve with you
my legions with yours
together well conquer a world beyond
the wildest dreams of alexander
rome
what was rome when sulla died
when crassus lost the armies
in parthia
these same men came after me
through the streets
howling like frightened dogs
caesar save us
they wouldve made me king then
i wouldnt let them then
he was thrown over the wall
its not a pretty sight
titus the moneylender
why should he be killed savagely
and brought here
obviously i am being warned
perhaps i am next
they dare to threaten you
caesarion where was my son
not far away
it frightened him
lepidus how many legions has he now
fifteen perhaps more
where
scythia
you and i will dine
with lepidus tonight
well talk of armies and battlefields
and lists of men to die
tomorrow in the senate let them offer
the sands of libya as my kingdom
i will accept
this is great caesar
beloved by rome
and at least one of us
who must die so that rome may live
if it must be done then let us do it
unashamed and unafraid
if the world is to know that
rome will not have a king
then let us make it the honorable
act of free men in the light of day
in the light of what day brutus
tomorrow
in the curia of the senate
and shall we be armed all of us
decimus come to caesars villa early
tomorrow to escort him to the senate
cimber marc antony must not enter
the curia with caesar
on a pretext lead him aside to speak
of what you heard at lepidus house
i remember something odd
at one point
caesar asked of each of us
what manner of death
we would choose
and caesar when it came to him
looked straight at me and said
sudden
odd isnt it
i was afraid id find you
still asleep
caesarion is
he was awake most of the night
did the storm frighten him
he said not but it did
i could tell
have you time to come in
decimus awaits he came by expressly
to accompany me to the senate
decimus has he done this before
a shrewd politician
he hopes to benefit
by arriving with me this day of days
keep antony close by
you too
the ladies of rome seem to have caught
each others fears this morning
like a head cold
calpurnia pleaded with me
not to go to the senate at all
why why would she
not want you to go
oh the bad night nothing else
she awoke screaming in her sleep
the thunder the lightning
she dreamed that she saw me murdered
that she saw me
or a statue of me covered in blood
the servants told her of seeing
men of fire in the heavens
odd happenings and so forth
strange birds were seen in the forum
one flew into the senate carrying a
sprig of laurel which it dropped
at the base of pompeys statue
pompey
caesar im afraid
you must not tell me to stay away
shall i too be afraid
can it be said of caesar he gave up
the world because of a thunderstorm
that such divinity that was in him ran
before mortal superstition
i feel you need me now
and i cannot help you
then help me to live as i have lived
always differently from the rest
the others for whom life is merely
an endless fear of dying
your gods
and mine go with you caesar
the world except for you
is filled with little men
fire burns
fire burns
the winds of destruction blow
rome
mighty and alone the winds of
destruction blow down upon thee
storms and hail
shall cut down wheat
shall cut down birds
and living things of earth
the heavens
and the gods themselves
my son
caesar caesar
caesar caesar
there has been much to do
and it seems you have
done it extremely well
is that where
yes
in egypt we build eternal monuments
to our dead heroes
here you burn them like rubbish
goodbye
ive brought the 10th legion
you have nothing to fear
nothing to fear
thats no reason for staying
so much has happened so quickly
suddenly i have the pieces
of a broken world to pick up
caesar you running off
at night like this
do you suggest that i stay why
dont ask me to be clear about
my feelings right now im tired
and with you
its never easy to say my meaning
but you speak so well antony
ive been told how excitingly
you read caesars will
to the sobbing murdering
free citizens of rome
naming as his heir
his great nephew octavian
i knew caesars will
and the reasons for it
if octavian hadnt been named
how many hours or minutes
would you have survived
and if caesar had become truly king
do you believe he would
still have named octavian
in any case its over
caesar
and the dream
that was murdered with him
first alexanders
then caesars
now over finished
first rome must be put in order
rome again
brutus and the others
must be found and killed
then
in death
caesar must be granted the power
and title he was denied in life
a dead king a dead god
safe enough even for rome
caesarion as caesars son could claim
the title of king and his deification
and to what court of law
would my son and i take our claim
i will present it
to the roman senate myself
i believe you would
and after the noble senators
have stopped laughing
do my son and i
then declare war on rome
no for this
a caesar would be needed
you have very little time
another caesar
but thank you
i shall remember your kindness to us
you give up too easily
do i
