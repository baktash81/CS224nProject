true
son
calpurnia third wife fourth
married long years
still caesar son child
wellknown calpurnia barren

must pleased caesar
calpurnia know caesar
socalled marriage validity roman law

celebrate triumphs see affairs
recognition senate bestowed upon caesar
rank privilege title dictator rome life
dictator life
long last master rome
apollodorus everything must made ready
ships servants prepared
surely nothing prevent sending us
attend coronation mine
majesty three long wasted years
senate taken long
recognize world already known
caesar master rome
rufio wishes speak

seems quite clear caesar declared dictator rome life
true vast difference dictator master
man call master rome

meaning far close word roman tolerate
king
dictator rome life
granted lifelong respect honor roman people
dictates dictator
must case course approved senate rome
thank rufio
enemy enemy enemy
sosigenes
must think odd propose invitation queen cleopatra

egypt officially declared ally rome
still confess surprised voted favor

may express gratitude permitted visit todays session
truly inspiring
witness free free men fearlessly expressed
seemed anxious present
saw harm granting permission didnt
today never shall doubt extent egypts wealth
dont like ciceros implication
theres enough gold egypt buy roman senator
enough seems buy vote

rome know cloth gold
reports reception streets extraordinary
queen instructed procession move slowly
peoples enjoyment
might almost believe cleopatra set capture citizens rome
one would every reason believing exactly
nothing like come rome since romulus remus
unafraid
unafraid
queen conquered people rome
people yes
walk like king head
listen cheer
take throne
bow right left
angry glance someone whos displeased
good tremble see tremble
dont smile
theyre trembling makes stop
prisoners dragged one one
one power anywhere therefore means nothing
wish known noble ruler say
pardon
louder pardon somebody want known
pardon
ah comes
friend trusted turned
power wealth family
kneels begs friend
trust
little king
caesar must wish needs commanding
drain pontine marshes free rome malaria

control tibers floods
improve harbor ostia please ambition
must wish roads built libraries public use
men italy equal rome
many merits merit approval
merit approval caesar come senate day
like schoolboy passing failing
suggest senate longer deliberate welfare rome
end process roman law
must law word must welfare rome
else take meaningless title dictator
ive carried sword long
pretend empty scabbard
surely caesar recalls symbolic nature title dictator
time conferred
honor caesar men
indicate romes gratitude triumphs name
brutus recall well triumphs

pharsalia one trembled antonys hand
hot separate head
cause
command spared life
deliberating body wish command
dictate stand dribbling virtue mouth
