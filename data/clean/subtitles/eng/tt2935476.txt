the name has always
sounded strange to me
i dont like to hear it
said out loud
my parents died
when i was very young
so theres no one to ask
where it came from
ive grown accustomed
to being on my own
some say even too accustomed
too independent
miss
miss
my scarf
i lost it
you must be farmer oak
gabriel yes
my aunts told me
about you
im working on her farm
for the winter
this is your land
im trespassing
youre welcome here

young george
whats this one called
old george
old george
so you find me amusing

goodness its mr oak
and after that
she was gonna be a governess
but she was far too wild
always has been
oh
miss bathsheba everdene
ive brought you a lamb
oh
thank you mr oak
hes such a dear thing
hes come too soon
and wont last the winter
so i thought youd like to
rear it instead
thank you
thats very kind
ill make some tea
the lamb is not why i came
go on
well miss everdene
i wanted to ask
would you like to marry me
ive never asked
anyone before
no
i should hope not
well
perhaps i erm i should
perhaps i should leave
mr oak
there are things to consider
is someone waiting for you
no but that doesnt mean
ill marry you
good day to you then
mr oak
mr oak wait
i didnt say i wouldnt
marry you either
i havent ever
really thought about it
i have 100 acres and 200 sheep
if i pay off the money
the farm is ours
you could have a piano
in a year or two
flowers and birds
and a frame for cucumbers
a baby or two
mr oak
or more
i will always
be there for you
mr oak
i dont want a husband
id hate to be
some mans property
i shouldnt mind
being a bride at a wedding
if i could be one
without getting a husband
thats stupid talk
you are better off
than i mr oak
i have an education
and nothing more
you could do much
much better than me
thats not the reason
im too independent for you
if i ever were to marry
id want somebody
to tame me
and youd never
be able to do it
youd grow to despise me
i would not
ever
goodbye miss everdene

joseph

and lets get this sorted out
look sharp men
the farmers here
mr oak is that you
perhaps you want
a shepherd maam
i owe you an immense
debt mr oak
if id have lost
all of this
id have lost my farm
your farm
my inheritance
my home too for a while
when my parents died
when my uncle passed away
he left it to me
of course
its a little ragged now
but this once used to be
the finest farm for miles
and i intend to
make it so again
perhaps you find
the idea preposterous
i no longer have
that luxury
im truly sorry to hear
of your loss mr oak
but if our reversal
of fortune
causes you any embarrassment
not at all maam
billy smallbury
9 and 8 pence
joseph poorgrass
go on joseph
go on lad
hat off
and what do you do joseph
i does general things
and in spring
i shoot the rooks
and help at
pig killing sir
i mean maam
7 and 9 pence
and another 9
because im new
thank you maam
now fanny robbin
where is fanny robbin
where is she
shes run away maam
shes gone off
with a soldier maam
not a soldier a sergeant
bailiff pennyways
here is 10 shillings
and a further 10
why
this ends our association
you are dismissed
i beg pardon miss
when my uncle was alive
this was a fine
productive farm
since his death
it has fallen into ruin
i can only assume
now see here miss
you cant get rid
of people like that
i have resolved to have
no bailiff at all
mr pennyways if youll
listen to me for a moment
mr pennyways
a fire threatened
to destroy the barn
and you are nowhere
to be found
i have no use for a man
like you mr pennyways
you are dismissed
get out
while you can
if i were you
now youve all met
our new shepherd mr oak
you understand
your duties mr oak
if i dont ill ask maam
from now on
you have a mistress
not a master
i dont yet know
my talents in farming
but i shall do my best
dont suppose
because im a woman
i dont know
the difference between
bad goingson and good
i shall be up
before youre awake
i shall be afield
before you are up
it is my intention
to astonish you all
back to work please
perhaps i should wait here
no
nonsense liddy
youre my companion
all of these
all of them
head high liddy
if they stare
do not hesitate
remember we have as much
right to be here as anyone
good morning
liddy if you lay things out
yes miss
gentlemen shall we
get back to business
there you go sir
if you feel it
you can feel the quality
this is
fine grain miss
thank you
perhaps we should
leave miss
but none of it
as good as this lot
its good stuff
ill grant you that
well its up to you
if you wanna go elsewhere
no no no
farmer stone
its miss everdene
farmer everdenes niece
he talked about you with
such great admiration
of course youre welcome
to try elsewhere
but i think youll find
the grain as good
as its ever been
mr stone
how much
5 a quarter
310 shillings
its the same grain
mr stone
you paid my uncle 5
this gentleman
will pay me the proper price
apparently not no
perhaps i should move on
liddy would you help me
with this gentleman
of course
perhaps youd like a sample
how much
5 a quarter
very well
hes rich hes handsome
he sends
the local girls mad
the taylor sisters
worked on him for two years
jane perkins spent 20
on new clothes
and might as well have
thrown the money
out the window
its said when he was young
his sweetheart jilted him
people always say that
women dont jilt men
men jilt us
did someone
jilt you miss
certainly not
a man did ask
to marry me once
some time ago
but i was too restless
to be tied down
what a luxury
to have a choice
kiss my foot sir
my face is for mouths
of consequence
it wasnt like that
at all
why
did you love him
no but i rather liked him
anyway its impossible now
mr boldwood
i had no intention
of shooting you
its miss everdene
your neighbor
farmer everdenes niece
im managing the farm
alone now
perhaps youve heard
yes im sure
youll do very well
in the circumstances
well as you say
were neighbors
look what
ive got here
what is it
listen to this
the rose is red
the violet blue
carnations sweet
and so are you
its a valentines card
im going to send it
to joseph poorgrass
just to see
the look of panic
on his stupid face
poor boy its a little bit
farfetched isnt it
what about mr oak then
no not mr oak
imagine if we sent it
to mr boldwood
ignoring you like that
all high and mighty
mr boldwood
perhaps not
why not
because i dont think
hell see the humor
perhaps he wouldnt
perhaps its too much
mr boldwood
youre right
perhaps it is
so were gonna toss for it
liddy
come on
open joseph
no jan coggan
open jan coggan
closed boldwood
sergeant troy 1100
yes sergeant troy and
miss fanny robbin
welcome
step down the front

miss everdenes here now

you dont think i would
no you wouldnt
come here
there
shes getting in
well done maam
gangway through
hey joseph joseph look
good morning
mr boldwood
miss everdene
mr boldwood wondered
if he might have a word
with you
mr boldwood of course
one thousand acres
a mix of arable and livestock
adjacent to everdene
an orchard glasshouse
i have some interesting pigs
some other time perhaps
thank you
you have a very beautiful house
mr boldwood
miss everdene
i want
very much
more than anything
to have you as my wife
miss everdene marry me
i
i feel
though i respect you
very much
i do not feel
what would justify me
in accepting your offer
i have known
disappointments before
but i would never have
asked in this instance
had i not been er
led to believe
unless
unless i am mistaken
the valentine
no youre not mistaken
but i should
never have sent it
forgive me it was
thoughtless to disturb
your peace of mind
so you meant it
as a joke
no no not as a joke
not exactly
it was impetuous
i see
perhaps you think
i am too old
but i will care for you
more than anyone
your own age
im sure you would
i will protect you
you shall have dresses
a gig uh a piano
i amuse you
no
its only
i have a piano
and i have my own farm
and i have no need
for a husband
no matter how honored
i am by the offer
i think
id like to return home
yes er ill er
ill get someone
to drive you
mr boldwood
ive made you miserable
it was very wicked of me
will you reconsider
let me think
yes
yes ill give you time
i will wait
youre working late
mr oak
will you teach me
here
spin the wheel
incline it like that
and slide it gently
spin the wheel
bit faster like that
very good
now slide it
i its
getting stuck
i wanted to ask
did the men say anything
today about mr boldwood
they did
what did they say
that youd be married
before the end of the year
come on
well id like you
to contradict it
to the men
well bathsheba
miss everdene please
if mr boldwood did really
speak of marriage
im not going to tell
stories just to please you
i just said i wanted you
to mention to the men
that it might not be true
i was going to marry him
i could say that
if you wish
but i could also
give you an opinion
on what youve done
i dare say
but i dont want
your opinion mr oak
i suppose not
well what is your opinion
that youre greatly
to blame
for playing pranks
on a man like mr boldwood
your actions were
unworthy of you
unworthy
may i ask
where my unworthiness lies
in rejecting you
perhaps
ive long given up
thinking of that
or wishing it either
but i will say this
leading on a man
you dont care for
is beneath you
i cannot allow a man
to criticize
my private conduct
you will please
leave the farm
at the end of the week
id prefer to go at once
then go i never want to
see your face again
very well
miss everdene
whoa there we are there
whats wrong with them
they broke fence
and ate the young clover
makes their stomachs swell
nothing
the whole flock is blasted
you mean theyre all
going to die
most probably
another one
gone here maam
only one way
of saving them
you must pierce
their side with a tool
a hollow tube
pricker inside
well can you do it
this ones still alive
no
can i
oh good lord no
one inch to the right
or the left
and you kill the ewe
for sure
not even a shepherd
can do it as a rule
well who then
gabriel
gabriel
gabriel oak wait
miss everdene needs you
why are you alone
did you find him
yes miss
so what did he say
he said
joseph
he said youre to go
in person
and request him civilly
in a proper manner
where does he get his airs
ill do no such thing
he said youd say that
he said to reply
beggars cant be choosers
mr oak
gabriel
gabriel
please dont
desert me gabriel
i need your help
make room for me
i wanna see
no dont you start
liddy be quiet

between the ribs

i thought we were
rather good together
so did i
we would make a fine duo
i wanted to thank you
for not approaching me
on that subject again
well it has not been easy
do you wish me to er
accompany you
back to the house
no i like to walk around
the farm every night
to make sure all is safe
then i
i can walk with you
ive done it
many times alone
good night mr boldwood
youve been very kind
a pleasure to see you
who are you
im sorry
i seem to be lost
were entangled
are you hurt
no
im looking for weatherbury
i hope i didnt startle you
weve got
hitched together somehow
here allow me
no no please
let me do it myself
if you lift your foot
for a moment
please dont stare
i dont think ive ever seen
a face as beautiful as yours
you shouldnt be here
please let me
have the lamp
a mighty impressive
harvest this looks like
miss
look
who is he liddy
sergeant francis troy
noble blood
full of promise
very sharp and trim
welleducated
there was good things
expected of him
he threw it all in
to be a soldier
well i wont have it
what are you doing miss
im going to
tell him to leave
i must absolutely insist
that you leave
at this very moment
i cant
will you follow me please
what angers you exactly
please
what i said
or the way i said it
you must know
who tells you
that youre beautiful
oh not to my face not
but there is someone
who kisses you
ive never been kissed
why couldnt you have just
passed by and said nothing
do you forgive me
i do not
why
because the things you say
i said that
you were beautiful
i wonder if you fight
as well as you speak
better
meet me tomorrow
i cant
you dont want to
yes but
then you must
i mustnt
nobody would know
please go now
tomorrow
the hollow in the ferns
do you trust me
i do
i give you my word
as a soldier
i will not harm you
the sword is blunt
but you must not flinch
ill try not to
you cut my hair
this sword could
skin you alive
but you told me i was safe
and you were
entirely safe
i gave you my word
now i will take this
miss everdene
perhaps i could
walk with you
im quite happy
to walk by myself
you should have nothing
to do with him
hes not
good enough for you
hes a perfectly decent man
thats not what i believe
why what have you heard
you dont know him at all
its all rumors
i like soldiers
but not this one
i believe him to have
no conscience at all
stay clear
dont listen to him
dont believe him
get rid of him
and what is it to you
im not such a fool
as to imagine
i might stand a chance now
that you are so above me
but dont suppose
im content to stay
a nobody all my life
one day i will leave you
you can be sure of that
but for now
i care for you too much
to see you go to ruin
because of him
so if you
dont mind ill
ill stay by your side
good evening
mr boldwood
you have been a dear friend
to me these past months
and it is because
i value our friendship
so greatly that i am writing
i am honored by your proposal
and have given it
much thought
but i must tell you that
to my own surprise
i have undergone
what can only be described
as a change of heart
and im afraid
i cannot accept your offer
i wasnt sure youd be here
where else would i be
you ready
are you sure
how does this sound
mrs bathsheba troy
all right
walk on
gentlemen
ladies and gentlemen
a short time ago
i had the privilege
and the simple fortune
of meeting this angel
your mistress
and now i stand before
you her husband
your master
and the proudest man
you will ever see
so please
charge your glasses
and sing out
to my most beautiful wife
mrs bathsheba troy
miss everdene
theres going to be a storm
oak you big lump to me
theres going to be a storm
we need to protect the ricks
or well lose the harvest
i need five to six men
for an hour no more
frank
perhaps we ought to
no
darling its our
wedding celebration
it will not rain tonight
my wife forbids it
now if youll excuse me
friends
one more thing
i may no longer
be sergeant troy
but i remain a soldier
in this one respect
the finest bottles
of french brandy
a triplestrength dose
for every man
cheers to your health
gabriel
gabriel
what can i do
its too dangerous
im coming up
hold it down
still no rain
itll come
come on hold me
come here come here
come here come on
gabriel ive been a fool
ive always had contempt
for silly girls
dazzled by flattery
in a scarlet uniform and
and now ive done
what i swore i would never do
but he told me
about another woman
a woman more beautiful
that hed loved before
and i couldnt bear it
so somewhere between
jealousy and distraction
i married him
i dont want an opinion
on the subject i just
in fact i forbid it
go to bed
ill finish it on my own
gabriel
thank you
sir
mr boldwood sir
i wanted to ensure your
mistress crops were safe
good work gabriel
shes lucky to have you
wait a moment sir
you seem unwell sir
you should go home
yes
yes i will
oak
you know that things
have not gone well
with me lately
i was going to get
a little settled in life
but er
it was not to be
i daresay
im something of a
a joke about the parish
but i do wanna make
one thing clear
there was no jilting
on her part
we were never engaged
no matter what people say
she promised me nothing
and yet
gabriel
i feel the most terrible grief
not a word to her
we understand each other yes
yes sir
damn and bother
sit
stay now turn around
can you spare a coin please
no no
hit him
come on
knock him out
hit him
pay up pay up mr troy
just take it
sir excuse me
could you spare a coin please
no
fanny
hello frank
hello
youre so pale
oh frank
darling your hands are shaking
i thought you said all souls
not all saints
i went to the wrong church
when i got there youd gone
and i dont blame you
but its been very hard
frank i
not now
my wife mustnt see you
your wife
mrs troy is very beautiful
no more than you
frank i must tell you
im carrying your child
what
what if i told you that
id made a terrible mistake
but that
i will make amends
i swear on my life
i will find a home
for you and our baby
youve sworn before frank
no this time
this time
go to budmouth
stay at the union
the workhouse frank
tonight just tonight
one night
and then meet me tomorrow
at 1000 on the bridge
ill bring you
all the money i have
and ill find a home for you
youll be safe my darling
and i promise you
i promise you
i will make amends
get back in the carriage
do you know
who that woman is
i do
who is she
shes nothing
get back in the carriage
frank
could you let me have 20
what for
i need it
if you continue to gamble
we will lose the farm
its not for gambling
whats it for
why should it matter
what its for
its my money
i work for it dont i
no you dont
not proper farm work
dont do something
youll regret
the money is required
for farm expenses
no mistake mr oak
this was miss robbins
last known abode
fanny was my uncles servant
and we shall treat her
with respect
perhaps we should
take her to the church
just for tonight
no bring her inside please
what did she die of liddy
i dont know miss
there were rumors but
fanny had a sweetheart
didnt she
yes miss
a soldier
please
come and sit
upstairs with me
i seem to cry a great deal
these days
i never used to cry at all
good night liddy
night miss
what
who is it
i cant say
stay stay stay
dont kiss them frank
im still your wife
this woman dead as she is
is more to me
than you ever were
or are or can be
you are nothing to me now
nothing
mrs troy
im afraid
im afraid
your husband has drowned
thats a great
responsibility sir
nonsense
no reason why a man
of your ability
shouldnt be able
to superintend two farms
and why shouldnt there be
stronger links
between our establishments
think of it
two thousand acres
under your sole charge
a share of my profits
miss everdene needs me here
and her farm
will have priority
id still need
miss everdenes permission
but of course
of course
i wouldnt dare do anything
without her blessing and
if itll help
sway your decision
theres an old comrade
of yours here
georgie
had to go all the way
to norcombe hill
to find this old fella
you pleased
yes sir very much
and ill have your
decision soon yes
you will sir
hey georgie
come on come on
come on come on
gabriel
youre getting on
in the world
of course you must
accept the offer
only with your approval
if i lose the farm
there may be no future
for any of us here
you know where
my loyalty lies
youre a man of great talent
ive no desire
to hold you back
thank you
come on georgie come on
forgive me
i understand there are debts
your late husband
perhaps perhaps we should
change the subject
perhaps i can help
mr boldwood
thats a very kind offer
but i would never dream
of accepting any money
i am a middleaged man
willing to protect you
for the rest of your life
you may run your farm
if you wish without risk
ill pay your
departed husbands debts
and guarantee
its financial stability
it can be your pastime
of course
wed need to wait
for proprietys sake
but when youre ready
im offering you shelter
comfort a safe harbor
as my wife
you must at least admire
my persistence
i do
and like me
yes
and respect me
yes very much
which is it
like or respect
it is difficult for a woman
to define her feelings
in a language
chiefly made by men
to express theirs
if you worry about a lack
of passion on your part
a lack of er
desire
if you worry about marrying me
merely out of guilt
and er
pity and compromise well
i dont mind
when must you give
your answer
by christmas
its a terrible responsibility
i hold that mans future
in my hands
his sanity too perhaps
could you care for him
you may suppose
love is wanting
but loves a wornout
miserable thing for me now
why are you asking me
i need someone whos objective
indifferent
then im afraid
youre asking the wrong man
good evening mr oak
good evening
thats it
mind
i appreciate
you coming along oak
ah
yes very good
well done erm
just more more things
yes sir
so what do you think
im not in the habit
of organizing parties
perhaps we should make it
an annual event
every christmas eve
ive invited
the whole village
do you think
miss everdene will come
im sure she will
yes
and youll come too i hope
i know miss everdene
would like you to be here
perhaps
for an hour or so
look im shaking
im so nervous
gabriel will you
as well as you can please
ill try
is there a knot
thats particularly
fashionable
youre asking the wrong man
what about women
does a woman keep her promise
she has promised
an implied promise
once again im
will she do whats right
if its not inconvenient to her
oak youve become
quite cynical lately
she never promised
that first time
therefore she has
never broken her promise
she hasnt promised
this time either
but she will tonight
i know she will
and when she does
i wanted to tell you
in advance gabriel
because i i believe
i know your secret
ive seen you together
the way you speak to her
and watch her
and look after her
and i know her er
profound affection for you
youve behaved like a man
and as the successful rival
successful through
your kindness
i wish to tell you
i am profoundly grateful
the cook
would like a word sir
kiss me joseph
no please dont
liddy dont
would you excuse me
ive come to say good night
go back and talk
to the poor things
youve broken their hearts
i dont suit
this kind of affair
no nor do i
i wish i could go too
i must go
not before youve danced
both of you
i insist
mr oak
thank you
tell me what to do
gabriel
do what is right
sorry excuse me
frank
black suits you
although a little premature
youre alive
and here i am
pulled from the sea
some fishermen found me
and brought me to shore
then i discovered
i was dead
and found i preferred it
for a while anyway
why have you come back
the strangest thing
i missed you
you dont seem
very happy to see me
you said
i was nothing to you
well then
honesty at all times
i find myself
in need of money
i gave up
my profession for you
and it seems a little harsh
that you have
a farm and a house
while im living off nothing
there is no money
then sell the farm
come home
no
i said come home
im your husband
and youll obey me
oh my god
