the name has always
sounded strange to me 
i don t like to hear it
said out loud 
my parents died
when i was very young 
so there s no one to ask
where it came from 
i ve grown accustomed
to being on my own 
some say even too accustomed 
too independent 
miss 
miss 
my scarf 
i lost it 
you must be farmer oak 
gabriel  yes 
my aunt s told me
about you 
i m working on her farm
for the winter 
this is your land 
i m trespassing 
you re welcome here 
good afternoon  farmer oak 
good afternoon  miss

young george 
what s this one called 
old george 
old george 
so you find me amusing

but she was far too wild 
always has been 
oh 
miss bathsheba everdene 
i ve brought you a lamb 
oh 
thank you  mr  oak 
he s such a dear thing 
he s come too soon
and won t last the winter 
so i thought you d like to
rear it instead 
thank you 
that s very kind 
i ll make some tea 
the lamb is not why i came 
go on 
well  miss everdene 
i wanted to ask   
would you like to marry me 
i ve never asked
anyone before 
no 
i should hope not 
well   
perhaps i  erm  i should   
perhaps i should leave 
mr  oak 
there are things to consider 
is someone waiting for you 
no  but that doesn t mean
i ll marry you 
good day to you  then 
mr  oak 
mr  oak  wait 
i didn t say i wouldn t
marry you  either 
i haven t ever
really thought about it 
i have 100 acres and 200 sheep 
if i pay off the money 
the farm is ours 
you could have a piano
in a year or two 
flowers and birds
and a frame for cucumbers 
a baby or two 
mr  oak   
or more 
i will always
be there for you 
mr  oak 
i don t want a husband 
i d hate to be
some man s property 
i shouldn t mind
being a bride at a wedding
if i could be one
without getting a husband 
that s stupid talk 
you are better off
than i  mr  oak 
i have an education
and nothing more 
you could do much 
much better than me 
that s not the reason 
i m too independent for you 
if i ever were to marry 
i d want somebody
to tame me
and you d never
be able to do it 
you d grow to despise me 
i would not 
ever

look sharp  men 
the farmer s here 
mr  oak  is that you 
perhaps you want
a shepherd  ma am 
i owe you an immense
debt  mr  oak 
if i d have lost
all of this 
i d have lost my farm 
your farm 
my inheritance 
my home  too  for a while
when my parents died 
when my uncle passed away 
he left it to me 
of course 
it s a little ragged now 
but this once used to be
the finest farm for miles 
and i intend to
make it so again 
perhaps you find
the idea preposterous 
i no longer have
that luxury 
i m truly sorry to hear
of your loss  mr  oak 
but if our reversal
of fortune
causes you any embarrassment   
not at all  ma am 
billy smallbury 
9 and 8 pence 
joseph poorgrass 
go on  joseph 
go on  lad 
hat off 
and what do you do  joseph 
i does general things 
and in spring
i shoot the rooks
and help at
pig killing  sir 
i mean ma am 
7 and 9 pence 
and another 9
because i m new 
thank you  ma am 
now  fanny robbin 
where is fanny robbin 
where is she 
she s run away  ma am 
she s gone off
with a soldier  ma am 
not a soldier  a sergeant 
bailiff pennyways 
here is 10 shillings
and a further 10 
why 
this ends our association 
you are dismissed 
i beg pardon  miss 
when my uncle was alive 
this was a fine 
productive farm 
since his death 
it has fallen into ruin 
i can only assume   
now see here  miss 
you can t get rid
of people like that 
i have resolved to have
no bailiff at all 
mr  pennyways  if you ll
listen to me for a moment 
mr  pennyways 
a fire threatened
to destroy the barn
and you are nowhere
to be found 
i have no use for a man
like you  mr  pennyways 
you are dismissed 
get out
while you can 
if i were you 
now you ve all met
our new shepherd  mr  oak 
you understand
your duties  mr  oak 
if i don t  i ll ask  ma am 
from now on 
you have a mistress 
not a master 
i don t yet know
my talents in farming 
but i shall do my best 
don t suppose 
because i m a woman 
i don t know
the difference between
bad goings on and good 
i shall be up
before you re awake 
i shall be a field
before you are up 
it is my intention
to astonish you all 
back to work  please 
perhaps i should wait here 
no 
nonsense  liddy 
you re my companion 
all of these 
all of them 
head high  liddy 
if they stare 
do not hesitate 
remember  we have as much
right to be here as anyone 
good morning 
liddy  if you lay things out 
yes  miss 
gentlemen  shall we
get back to business 
there you go  sir 
if you feel it 
you can feel the quality 
this is
fine grain  miss 
thank you 
perhaps we should
leave  miss 
but none of it
as good as this lot 
it s good stuff 
i ll grant you that 
well  it s up to you 
if you wanna go elsewhere   
no  no  no   
farmer stone 
it s miss everdene 
farmer everdene s niece 
he talked about you with
such great admiration 
of course  you re welcome
to try elsewhere 
but i think you ll find
the grain as good
as it s ever been 
mr  stone 
how much 
 5 a quarter 
 3 10 shillings 
it s the same grain 
mr  stone 
you paid my uncle  5 
 3 10 
this gentleman
will pay me the proper price 
apparently not  no 
 4 
 4 10 
 4 05 
perhaps i should move on 
liddy  would you help me
with this gentleman 
of course 
perhaps you d like a sample 
how much 
 5 a quarter 
very well 
 4 10 
he s rich  he s handsome 
he sends
the local girls mad 
the taylor sisters
worked on him for two years 
jane perkins spent  20
on new clothes
and might as well have
thrown the money
out the window 
it s said  when he was young 
his sweetheart jilted him 
people always say that 
women don t jilt men 
men jilt us 
did someone
jilt you  miss 
certainly not 
a man did ask
to marry me once 
some time ago 
but i was too restless
to be tied down 
what a luxury 
to have a choice 
 kiss my foot  sir 
my face is for mouths
of consequence  
it wasn t like that
at all 
why 
did you love him 
no  but i rather liked him 
anyway  it s impossible now 
mr  boldwood 
i had no intention
of shooting you 
it s miss everdene 
your neighbor 
farmer everdene s niece 
i m managing the farm
alone now 
perhaps you ve heard 
yes  i m sure
you ll do very well 
in the circumstances 
well  as you say 
we re neighbors 
look what
i ve got here 
what is it 
listen to this 
 the rose is red
the violet blue
 carnation s sweet
and so are you 
it s a valentine s card 
i m going to send it
to joseph poorgrass
just to see
the look of panic
on his stupid face 
poor boy  it s a little bit
far fetched  isn t it 
what about mr  oak  then 
no  not mr  oak 
imagine if we sent it
to mr  boldwood 
ignoring you like that 
all high and mighty 
mr  boldwood 
perhaps not 
why not 
because i don t think
he ll see the humor 
perhaps he wouldn t 
perhaps it s too much 
mr  boldwood 
you re right 
perhaps it is 
so we re gonna toss for it 
liddy 
come on 
open  joseph 
no  jan coggan 
open  jan coggan

come here 
there 
she s getting in 
well done  ma am 
gangway through 
hey  joseph  joseph  look 
good morning 
mr  boldwood 
miss everdene 
mr  boldwood wondered
if he might have a word
with you 
mr  boldwood  of course 
one thousand acres 
a mix of arable and livestock 
adjacent to everdene 
an orchard  glasshouse 
i have some interesting pigs 
some other time  perhaps 
thank you 
you have a very beautiful house 
mr  boldwood 
miss everdene 
i want
very much 
more than anything 
to have you as my wife 
miss everdene  marry me 
i   
i feel   
though i respect you
very much 
i do not feel
what would justify me
in accepting your offer 
i have known
disappointments before 
but i would never have
asked in this instance
had i not been  er 
led to believe   
unless   
unless i am mistaken 
the valentine 
no  you re not mistaken 
but i should
never have sent it 
forgive me  it was
thoughtless to disturb
your peace of mind 
so you meant it
as a joke 
no  no  not as a joke 
not exactly 
it was impetuous 
i see 
perhaps you think
i am too old 
but i will care for you
more than anyone
your own age 
i m sure you would   
i will protect you 
you shall have dresses 
a gig  uh  a piano 
i amuse you 
no 
it s only   
i have a piano 
and i have my own farm 
and i have no need
for a husband 
no matter how honored
i am by the offer 
i think
i d like to return home 
yes  er    i ll  er   
i ll get someone
to drive you 
mr  boldwood 
i ve made you miserable 
it was very wicked of me 
will you reconsider 
let me think 
yes 
yes  i ll give you time 
i will wait 
you re working late 
mr  oak 
will you teach me 
here 
spin the wheel 
incline it  like that 
and slide it gently 
spin the wheel 
bit faster  like that 
very good 
now slide it 
i    it s   
getting stuck 
i wanted to ask 
did the men say anything
today about mr  boldwood 
they did 
what did they say 
that you d be married
before the end of the year 
come on 
well  i d like you
to contradict it 
to the men 
well  bathsheba   
 miss everdene   please 
if mr  boldwood did really
speak of marriage 
i m not going to tell
stories just to please you 
i just said i wanted you
to mention to the men
that it might not be true
i was going to marry him 
i could say that
if you wish 
but i could also
give you an opinion
on what you ve done 
i dare say 
but i don t want
your opinion  mr  oak 
i suppose not 
well  what is your opinion 
that you re greatly
to blame
for playing pranks
on a man like mr  boldwood 
your actions were
unworthy of you 
unworthy 
may i ask
where my unworthiness lies 
in rejecting you 
perhaps 
i ve long given up
thinking of that 
or wishing it  either 
but i will say this 
leading on a man
you don t care for
is beneath you 
i cannot allow a man
to criticize
my private conduct 
you will please
leave the farm
at the end of the week 
i d prefer to go at once 
then go  i never want to
see your face again 
very well 
miss everdene 
whoa  there we are  there 
what s wrong with them 
they broke fence
and ate the young clover 
makes their stomachs swell 
nothing 
the whole flock is blasted 
you mean they re all
going to die 
most probably 
another one
gone here  ma am 
only one way
of saving them 
you must pierce
their side with a tool 
a hollow tube 
pricker inside 
well  can you do it 
this one s still alive 
no 
can i 
oh  good lord  no 
one inch to the right
or the left 
and you kill the ewe
for sure 
not even a shepherd
can do it  as a rule 
well  who  then 
gabriel 
gabriel 
gabriel oak  wait 
miss everdene needs you 
why are you alone

yes  miss

joseph 
he said you re to go
in person
and request him civilly
in a proper manner 
where does he get his airs 
i ll do no such thing 
he said you d say that 
he said to reply 
 beggars can t be choosers

i wanted to thank you
for not approaching me
on that subject again 
well  it has not been easy 
do you wish me to  er 
accompany you
back to the house 
no  i like to walk around
the farm every night
to make sure all is safe

i can walk with you 
i ve done it
many times alone 
good night  mr  boldwood 
you ve been very kind 
a pleasure to see you 
who are you 
i m sorry 
i seem to be lost 
we re entangled 
are you hurt 
no 
i m looking for weatherbury 
i hope i didn t startle you 
we ve got
hitched together somehow 
here  allow me 
no  no  please 
let me do it myself 
if you lift your foot
for a moment 
please don t stare 
i don t think i ve ever seen
a face as beautiful as yours 
you shouldn t be here 
please let me
have the lamp 
a mighty impressive
harvest this looks like 
miss 
look 
who is he  liddy 
sergeant francis troy 
noble blood 
full of promise 
very sharp and trim 
well educated 
there was good things
expected of him 
he threw it all in
to be a soldier 
well  i won t have it 
what are you doing  miss 
i m going to
tell him to leave 
i must absolutely insist
that you leave
at this very moment 
i can t 
will you follow me  please 
what angers you  exactly 
please 
what i said
or the way i said it 
you must know 
who tells you
that you re beautiful 
oh  not to my face  not   
but there is someone
who kisses you 
i ve never been kissed 
why couldn t you have just
passed by and said nothing 
do you forgive me 
i do not 
why 
because the things you say   
i said that
you were beautiful 
i wonder if you fight
as well as you speak 
better 
meet me  tomorrow 
i can t 
you don t want to 
yes  but   
then you must 
i mustn t 
nobody would know 
please go now 
tomorrow 
8 00 
the hollow in the ferns 
do you trust me 
i do 
i give you my word
as a soldier 
i will not harm you 
the sword is blunt 
but you must not flinch 
i ll try not to 
you cut my hair 
this sword could
skin you alive 
but you told me i was safe 
and you were 
entirely safe 
i gave you my word 
now i will take this 
miss everdene 
perhaps i could
walk with you 
i m quite happy
to walk by myself 
you should have nothing
to do with him 
he s not
good enough for you 
he s a perfectly decent man 
that s not what i believe 
why  what have you heard 
you don t know him at all 
it s all rumors 
i like soldiers 
but not this one 
i believe him to have
no conscience at all 
stay clear 
don t listen to him 
don t believe him 
get rid of him 
and what is it to you 
i m not such a fool
as to imagine
i might stand a chance now
that you are so above me 
but don t suppose
i m content to stay
a nobody all my life 
one day i will leave you 
you can be sure of that 
but for now 
i care for you too much
to see you go to ruin
because of him 
so if you
don t mind  i ll   
i ll stay by your side 
good evening 
mr  boldwood 
you have been a dear friend
to me these past months 
and it is because
i value our friendship
so greatly that i am writing 
i am honored by your proposal
and have given it
much thought 
but i must tell you that 
to my own surprise 
i have undergone
what can only be described
as a change of heart
and i m afraid
i cannot accept your offer 
i wasn t sure you d be here 
where else would i be 
you ready 
are you sure 
how does this sound 
mrs  bathsheba troy 
all right 
walk on 
gentlemen 
ladies and gentlemen 
a short time ago 
i had the privilege
and the simple fortune
of meeting this angel 
your mistress 
and now i stand before
you her husband 
your master 
and the proudest man
you will ever see 
so  please 
charge your glasses
and sing out
to my most beautiful wife 
mrs  bathsheba troy 
miss everdene 
there s going to be a storm 
oak  you big lump  to me 
there s going to be a storm 
we need to protect the ricks
or we ll lose the harvest 
i need five to six men
for an hour  no more 
frank 
perhaps we ought to   
no 
darling  it s our
wedding celebration 
it will not rain tonight 
my wife forbids it 
now if you ll excuse me 
friends 
one more thing 
i may no longer
be sergeant troy 
but i remain a soldier
in this one respect 
the finest bottles
of french brandy 
a triple strength dose
for every man 
cheers  to your health 
gabriel 
gabriel 
what can i do 
it s too dangerous 
i m coming up 
hold it down 
still no rain 
it ll come 
come on  hold me 
come here  come here 
come here  come on 
gabriel  i ve been a fool 
i ve always had contempt
for silly girls
dazzled by flattery
in a scarlet uniform and   
and now i ve done
what i swore i would never do 
but he told me
about another woman 
a woman more beautiful
that he d loved before 
and i couldn t bear it 
so somewhere between
jealousy and distraction 
i married him 
i don t want an opinion
on the subject  i just   
in fact  i forbid it 
go to bed 
i ll finish it on my own 
gabriel   
thank you 
sir 
mr  boldwood  sir 
i wanted to ensure your
mistress  crops were safe

a little settled in life

a joke about the parish 
but i do wanna make
one thing clear 
there was no jilting
on her part

what 
who is it 
i can t say   
stay  stay  stay 
don t kiss them  frank 
i m still your wife 
this woman  dead as she is 
is more to me
than you ever were 
or are  or can be 
you are nothing to me now 
nothing 
mrs  troy 
i m afraid   
i m afraid
your husband has drowned 
that s a great
responsibility  sir 
nonsense 
no reason why a man
of your ability
shouldn t be able
to superintend two farms 
and why shouldn t there be
stronger links
between our establishments 
think of it 
two thousand acres
under your sole charge 
a share of my profits 
miss everdene needs me here 
and her farm
will have priority 
i d still need
miss everdene s permission 
but  of course 
of course 
i wouldn t dare do anything
without her blessing  and 
if it ll help
sway your decision 
there s an old comrade
of yours here 
georgie 
had to go all the way
to norcombe hill
to find this old fella 
you pleased 
yes  sir  very much 
and i ll have your
decision soon  yes 
you will  sir 
hey  georgie 
come on  come on 
come on  come on 
gabriel 
you re getting on
in the world 
of course you must
accept the offer 
only with your approval 
if i lose the farm 
there may be no future
for any of us here 
you know where
my loyalty lies 
you re a man of great talent 
i ve no desire
to hold you back 
thank you 
come on  georgie  come on 
forgive me 
i understand there are debts 
your late husband 
perhaps    perhaps we should
change the subject 
perhaps i can help 
mr  boldwood 
that s a very kind offer 
but i would never dream
of accepting any money 
i am a middle aged man
willing to protect you
for the rest of your life 
you may run your farm 
if you wish  without risk 
i ll pay your
departed husband s debts
and guarantee
its financial stability 
it can be your pastime 
of course 
we d need to wait 
for propriety s sake 
but when you re ready 
i m offering you shelter 
comfort  a safe harbor 
as my wife 
you must at least admire
my persistence 
i do 
and like me 
yes 
and respect me 
yes  very much 
which is it 
like or respect 
it is difficult for a woman
to define her feelings
in a language
chiefly made by men
to express theirs 
if you worry about a lack
of passion on your part 
a lack of  er 
desire 
if you worry about marrying me
merely out of guilt 
and  er 
pity and compromise  well   
i don t mind 
when must you give
your answer 
by christmas 
it s a terrible responsibility 
i hold that man s future
in my hands 
his sanity  too  perhaps 
could you care for him 
you may suppose
love is wanting 
but love s a worn out 
miserable thing for me now 
why are you asking me 
i need someone who s objective 
indifferent 
then i m afraid
you re asking the wrong man 
good evening  mr  oak 
good evening 
that s it 
mind 
i appreciate
you coming along  oak 
ah 
yes  very good 
well done  erm   
just more    more things 
yes  sir 
so what do you think 
i m not in the habit
of organizing parties 
perhaps we should make it
an annual event 
every christmas eve 
i ve invited
the whole village 
do you think
miss everdene will come 
i m sure she will 
yes 
and you ll come too  i hope 
i know miss everdene
would like you to be here 
perhaps 
for an hour or so 
look  i m shaking 
i m so nervous 
gabriel  will you   
as well as you can  please 
i ll try 
is there a knot
that s particularly
fashionable 
you re asking the wrong man 
what about women 
does a woman keep her promise 
she has promised 
an implied promise 
once again  i m   
will she do what s right 
if it s not inconvenient to her 
oak  you ve become
quite cynical lately 
she never promised
that first time 
therefore  she has
never broken her promise 
she hasn t promised
this time  either 
but she will  tonight 
i know she will 
and when she does   
i wanted to tell you
in advance  gabriel 
because i    i believe
i know your secret 
i ve seen you together 
the way you speak to her 
and watch her 
and look after her 
and i know her  er 
profound affection for you 
you ve behaved like a man 
and as the successful rival 
successful through
your kindness 
i wish to tell you
i am profoundly grateful 
the cook
would like a word  sir 
kiss me  joseph 
no  please don t 
liddy  don t 
would you excuse me 
i ve come to say good night 
go back and talk
to the poor things 
you ve broken their hearts 
i don t suit
this kind of affair 
no  nor do i 
i wish i could go  too 
i must go 
not before you ve danced 
both of you 
i insist 
mr  oak 
thank you 
tell me what to do 
gabriel 
do what is right 
sorry  excuse me 
frank 
black suits you 
although a little premature 
you re alive 
and here i am 
pulled from the sea 
some fishermen found me
and brought me to shore 
then i discovered
i was dead
and found i preferred it 
for a while  anyway 
why have you come back 
the strangest thing 
i missed you 
you don t seem
very happy to see me 
you said
i was nothing to you 
well  then 
honesty at all times 
i find myself
in need of money 
i gave up
my profession for you 
and it seems a little harsh
that you have
a farm and a house
while i m living off nothing 
there is no money 
then sell the farm 
come home 
no 
i said  come home 
i m your husband
and you ll obey me 
oh  my god 
let me see 
if it s any consolation 
his life will be spared 
crime of passion 
morning  liddy 
it s a fine harvest  ma am 
best we ve had in years 
will we have it all over
before the dew 
we will indeed  ma am 
luck s been on our side 
come  liddy  give me a hand 
i m sorry i startled you 
i wanted to
tidy up for them 
i haven t been here for so long 
are you going in 
rehearsals 
i sing bass in the choir 
yes  i ve heard you 
then i apologize 
i ve been hoping to get
a chance to talk to you 
we ve    we ve not spoken
as much as i d have liked 
no 
i m leaving england 
leaving 
going to america 
there s a boat
leaving bristol
in four days  time 
i ll be on it 
now that the farm
is secure 
i understand i should
give you notice 
no  you must go
when you want 
i ll leave first thing tomorrow 
no fuss 
i think that s best 
gabriel 
gabriel 
wait 
you ll think i m strange  but   
i ve been worried 
have i offended you somehow 
no  not at all 
is it money 
i ll pay you
whatever you want 
i don t need money now 
a formal partnership  then 
nor a partnership 
the farm
belongs to you alone 
it s the finest farm
for miles around 
then why else
are you leaving 
i said
i d leave you one day 
well  you must not go 
you forbid me 
yes  if you like 
i forbid you 
it s time for you
to fight your own battles 
and win them  too 
so we should
say good bye  then 
i suppose so 
gabriel  wait 
thank you  gabriel 
you ve believed in me
and fought for me
and stood by my side when
all the rest of the world
is against me 
and we ve been through
so much together 
wasn t i your
first sweetheart 
weren t you mine 
and now i d have to
go on without you 
if i knew   
if i knew that you would
let me love you
and marry you   
but you will never know 
why not 
because you never ask 
would you say no again 
i don t know 
probably
