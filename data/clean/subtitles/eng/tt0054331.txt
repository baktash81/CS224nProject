called christianity   
which was destined to overthrow
the pagan tyranny of rome   
and bring about a new society   
the roman republics toodat the very
centre of the civilized world 
  of all things fairest    
sang the poet   
  first among cities and
home of the gods is golden rome    
yet even at the zenith
of her pride and power   
the republic lay fatally stricken
with a disease called   
human slavery 
the age of the dictator
was at hand   
waiting in the shadows
for the event to bring it forth 
in that same century   
in the conquered
greek province of thrace   
an illiterate slave woman
added to her master s wealth   
by giving birth to a son
whom she named spartacus 
a proud  rebellious son   
who was sold to living death
in the mines of libya   
before his thirteenth birthday 
there  under whip
and chain and sun   
he lived out his youth
and his young manhood   
dreaming the death of slavery   
2 000 years
before it finally would die 
back to work 
get up  spartacus 
you thracian dog 
come on  get up 
my ankle  my ankle 
my ankle 
spartacus again 
this time he dies 
back to work  all of you 
  welcome  lentulus batiatus 
  welcome  indeed  my dear captain 
eleven miles
through the disastrous heat   
and the cost
of hiring an escort   ruinous 
even so  i warrant you have nothing
fit to sell me  have you  captain 
i ve wasted my time and my money 
tell me the truth 
i think we have a few
you might be interested in 
what  these  carrion 
the buzzards are late 
this one here s not bad 
he s a gaul 
i don t like gauls  hairy 
 can he come down from there unassisted 
 come down  you 
come down 
be good enough
to show me the teeth 
  open your mouth 
  thank you 
yes  as the teeth go 
so go the bones 
this mouth is
really impermissible 
  the fellow s made of chalk 
  we have others  many others 
the sun s over there 
i have to pay these people 
who s that 
this one s a thracian 
i m making an example of him 
  how 
  starve him to death 
it s the only thing impresses slaves 
what a pity 
he reacts  good muscle tone 
can i see his teeth 
open your mouth  spartacus 
you smell like a rhinoceros 
captain  you asked him to open
his mouth  he doesn t obey you 
his teeth are
the best thing about him 
he hamstrung a guard with them
not more than an hour ago 
hamstrung  how marvellous 
i wish i d been here 
i ll take him 
let s look at some of the others 
come along 
in spite of sickness and death 
we will profit 11 000 sesterces 
including your commission 
of course 
no  sir 
without my commission 
marcellus  there they are 
they re a dirty looking lot 
but it s the best i could find 
no one else could have made
so fine a choice 
slaves   
you have arrived at the gladiatorial
school of lentulus batiatus 
here you will be trained by experts
to fight in pairs to the death 
obviously  you won t be required
to fight to the death here 
that will only be
after you ve been sold   
and then for ladies
and gentlemen of quality   
those who appreciate
a fine kill 
a gladiator s like a stallion 
he must be pampered 
you ll be oiled  bathed   
shaved  massaged 
taught to use your heads 
a good body with a dull brain
is as cheap as life itself 
you ll be given
your ceremonial caudas 
marcellus  please  there 
be proud of them 
on certain special occasions 
those of you who please me   
will even be given
the companionship of a young lady 
approximately half our graduates   
live for five  ten   ten years 
some of them
even attain freedom   
and become trainers themselves 
marcellus 
i congratulate you 
and may fortune smile on most of you 
marcellus  watch the second
from the right 
he s a thracian  they were going
to kill him for hamstringing a guard 
  we ll break him of that 
  don t overdo it  he has quality 
next 
next 
i like you 
i want you
to be my friend 
i want to be your friend 
all i ask is that
you get along with me 
what s your name  slave 
spartacus 
i feel you don t like me 
give him your sword 
take it 
i have a feeling
you want to kill me 
this is the only chance
you ll ever get 
kill me 
don t be afraid  slave 
you have that sword 
i only have
this piece of wood 
are you going
to disobey me 
take his sword 
you re not as stupid
as i thought 
you might even be intelligent 
that s dangerous for slaves 
you just remember   
from now on  everything you do 
i ll be watching 
you did the right thing 
every once in a while  marcellus likes
to kill a man as an example 
i think he s picked you 
better watch him 
  how long have you been here 
  six months 
i wish he d pick me 
i want one chance at that pig
before they carry me out 
quiet 
no talking down there 
you ll get us all in trouble 
just like in the mines 
what s your name 
you don t want
to know my name 
i don t want
to know your name 
just a friendly question 
gladiators don t make friends 
if we re ever matched
in the arena together   
i ll have to kill you 
helena   
with galino 
patricia   
crixus 
priscilla   
david 
claudia   
pharox 
varinia   
  dionysius 
  no  no  spartacus 
spartacus 
felicia  
i ve never had a woman 
you have one now  spartacus 
you must take her 
  go away 
  what will she think of you 
indeed  what will i think of you 
go away 
come  come  be generous 
we must learn to share our pleasures 
i m not an animal 
you re not trying to escape 
by any chance 
direct your courage
to the girl  spartacus 
i m not an animal 
  i m not an animal 
  neither am l 
what s your name 
varinia 
you ll have to take her
out of here  marcellus 
you may not be
an animal  spartacus   
but this sorry show
gives me very little hope   
that you ll ever be a man 
first rule 
you get an instant kill
on the red 
here  here 
always remember 
go for the red first   
because if you don t 
your opponent will 
in the blue 
you get a cripple 
here  here   
here and here 
second rule 
go for the cripple
before the slow kill 
here s a slow kill
on the yellow 
here  here   
and here 
remember   
a slow kill may have enough left
in him to kill you before he dies 
with a cripple 
you know you ve got him   
if you keep your distance
and wear him down 
the rest is all right
for a public spectacle in rome   
but here at capua we expect
more than simple butchery   
and we get it 
spartacus  why are you looking
at that girl 
varinia  stand still 
since all he can do
is look at girls   
all right  slave 
go ahead and look 
i said look 
no  no  this one
goes to the spaniard 
have a good night s rest 
spartacus 
in there 
woman 
i ve warned you
about this kind of thing 
all right  bring them in 
no talking 
move along there 
did they hurt you 
no 
that s a kill 
one  two   
three  four  five 
one  two  three  four 
we have visitors 
tremendous visitors 
two simply enormous roman lords
on the hill 
how easily impressed
you are  ramon 
just  cause they re romans 
i suppose they re enormous 
tell them to wait for me
when they arrive 
 master  you don t understand 
 how enormous do these roman lords get 
one of them is
marcus licinius crassus 
what  wait a minute 
crassus here  varinia 
my red toga with the acorns 
and some chairs in the atrium 
second best wine 
no  the best 
but small goblets 
gracchus  you know
how crassus loathes him 
take him away 
  i can t lift it 
  use your imagination  cover him 
tell marcellus
to get the men ready 
crassus has expensive taste 
he ll want a show of some sort 
forgive me  gracchus 
marcus licinius crassus   
most noble radiance   
first general of the republic   
father and defender of rome   
honour my house 
bless it with your presence 
wine  sweetmeats  can t you see
that their honours are exhausted 
have the goodness to sit 
is anything wrong 
your nobility 
no 
welcome
to the lady claudia maria   
former wife
of lucius caius marius   
whose recent execution
touched us all so deeply 
honour to the lady helena   
daughter of the late
septimus optimus glabrus   
whose fame shall live on forever
in the person of his son   
your brother 
marcus publius glabrus   
hero of the eastern wars 
how very much he knows 
allow me to bring you
up to date 
we re here to celebrate the marriage
of my brother to the lady claudia 
a mating of eagles 
your sanctity 
fan his magnitude 
he sweats 
my young friends desire
a private showing of two pairs 
two pairs  oh  yes 
i think i have something
that would please them 
  two pairs to the death 
  to the death  your ladyship 
surely you don t think we came
all the way to capua for gymnastics 
but i beg your honours 
here in capua we train
the finest gladiators in all italy 
we can give you a display
of swordsmanship   
which is better than anything
you can see in rome at any cost 
when they re sold  their new masters
may do with them as they wish   
but here  no  we never fight them
to the death 
crassus 
today is an exception 
but the ill feeling it would spread
through the whole school 
and then the cost  the cost 
name your price 
25 000 sesterces 
arrange it 
are you serious  sir 
arrange it immediately 
of course  we shall want
to choose them ourselves 
you do have a certain variety 
don t you 
yes  inexhaustible 
spartacus  there s going to be
a fight to the death 
  to the death 
  how do you know 
i heard marcellus
tell one of his guards 
  who fights 
  i don t know 
to the death 
what if they matched
you and me 
they won t 
what if they did 
would you fight 
i d have to  so would you 
would you try to kill me 
yes  i d kill 
i d try to save  
i d try to stay alive
and so would you 
all gladiators
up to the training area 
some visitors
want to admire you 
form a line
right here in front of me 
would your excellencies care
to make your selection now 
claudia 
they re magnificent 
for you  lady helena   
may i suggest praxus 
a veritable tiger 
i don t like him 
  i prefer that one 
  which one 
david 
crixus  yes 
marcellus  crixus
for the short sword 
have you ever seen such a pair
of shoulders  dionysius 
i admit he s small  but he s very
compact and extremely strong 
in fact  he looks  
he looks smaller here
than he does in the actual arena 
optical 
  give me that one 
  galino 
yes  yes  galino 
you have a shrewd eye  your pulchritude 
if i may permit myself the  
practically every man in this school
is an expert with a thracian sword   
but the trident is something
very rare these days 
may i suggest   
the ethiopian 
there are very few ethiopians
in the country 
ethiopians are recognized
as masters of the trident 
i ll take him 
draba  oh  no 
for you i want only the best  
i want the most beautiful 
i ll take the big black one 
very good 
only one man
in the entire school   
stands a chance with the thracian knife
against the trident 
there 
  over there  lady helena 
  he s impertinent 
  i ll take him 
  impertinent  and a coward to boot 
have him flogged 
over there  lady helena 
the beast of libya 
i prefer the coward 
if both men are down
and refuse to continue to fight   
your trainer will slit their throats
like chickens 
  we want no tricks 
  tricks  at the school of batiatus 
you heard the instruction  marcellus 
remember it 
i feel so sorry for the poor things
in all this heat 
don t put them
in those suffocating tunics 
let them wear just enough
for modesty 
whatever they wear  lady 
they ll bless your name 
back  the rest of you 
  our choosing has bored you 
  no 
most exciting  i tingle 
do let s get out of the sun 
may i conduct your magnificences
to the gallery now 
an eavesdropper 
oh  the god 
how far from rome must i go
to avoid that cunning face 
crassus  don t talk about gracchus 
he s so hateful 
for gracchus  hatred of the patrician
class is a profession   
and not such a bad one  either 
how else can one become
master of the mob   
and first senator of rome 
crassus  it s so boring 
i believe that girl smells
of perfume 
whatever it is 
she smells most delectable 
you can t keep slaves from stealing
these days unless you chain them 
when a slave s as pretty as she is 
she doesn t have to steal 
an arrangement is made 
if her ankles are good   
you could be sure
an arrangement was made 
  master 
  good heavens  a catastrophe 
  i ve been anointed 
  you trollop 
  i believe you did that on purpose 
  it was an accident  come here  girl 
don t be frightened 
  what country are you from 
  britannia 
how long have you been
a slave 
since i was thirteen 
you have a certain education 
my first master had me tutored
for his children 
i like her  she has spirit 
  i ll buy her 
  buy her  your magnificence 
i have spent
quite a lot of money on her 
yes  i ve no doubt of it 
two thousand sesterces 
two thou  
she ll be waiting at your litter 
no  i don t want her feet
spoilt by walking 
send her to rome with your steward
the next time he has to go there 
he leaves tomorrow
and the girl with him 
more wine 
and thank your gods 
you provoke me  crassus 
i shan t be nice to you any more 
  why distress me so much 
  you re horribly rich 
yet you re the only one
of my brother s friends   
who hasn t given him
a wedding present 
i was saving it
for a more suitable moment 
here  give it to him  child 
what is it 
as from this moment  your husband
is commander of the garrison of rome 
wonderful 
i don t know how i shall
ever be able to repay you 
time will solve that mystery 
  the garrison of rome 
  yes 
the only power in rome strong enough
to checkmate gracchus and his senate 
you are clever 
open up 
through that door 
but you will have
to watch him  claudia 
father almost disinherited him
because of slave girls 
the marriage contract
absolutely forbids a harem 
what about your litter bearers 
after all  every one of them
is under 20   
and taller than they should be 
she sets rather a high standard
for you  does she  
your pleasure  your highness 
to you  my dear  shall go the honour
of starting this poetic drama 
open up 
first pair 
crixus and galino 
those who are about to die
salute you 
crixus 
next pair 
those who are about to die 
salute you 
your thracian s doing well 
how were you able to get my appointment
without gracchus knowing 
i fought fire with oil 
i purchased the senate behind his back 
i still think
the trident s going to win 
  why doesn t he kill him 
  kill him 
what s the matter now 
  kill him 
  kill him  you imbecile 
he ll hang there till he rots 
take a last look  spartacus 
she s going to rome 
she s been sold 
she s been sold 
no talking
in the kitchen  slave 
there s trouble in the mess hall 
they killed marcellus and maybe others 
call out the guard 
move  move 
on second thoughts 
i ll deliver the girl personally 
ride to capua  call out the garrison 
i don t trust this lot 
  i hold you responsible 
  yes  sir 
around capua 
they ravaged the countryside   
forcing other slaves to join them 
looting  robbing 
burning everything   
while they make their camp
in the escarpments of vesuvius 
each day swells their numbers 
the situation presently lies
in the hands   
of this august body 
where s the mighty crassus 
  out of the city 
  at least you re here 
no need to fear for rome
as long as glabrus is with us 
let me add  over 1 00 estates
have been burned   
among them  gentlemen 
my own   
burned to the ground
and three million sesterces lost 
i propose the immediate recall
of pompey and his legions from spain 
  i could bring them in with 500 men 
  don t make a fool of yourself 
why call back the legions   
when the garrison of rome
has nothing to do   
but to defend us
from sausage makers 
let s send glabrus
against these scoundrels 
give  em a taste of roman steel 
i protest 
i most strongly protest 
there are more slaves
in rome than romans 
with the garrison absent 
what s to prevent them from rising too 
i did not say
the whole garrison 
six cohorts will
more than do the job 
the rest can stay in rome
to save you from your housemaids 
will you accept
such a charge  glabrus 
i accept the charge
of the senate   
if the senate truly charges me 
the garrison of rome
stands ready 
slave hunting s a dirty business 
it takes a brave commander
to consent to it 
i propose we turn
the city out tomorrow   
in tribute to glabrus
as he marches through 
and   
for temporary command
of the garrison during his absence   
i propose caius julius caesar 
you don t look very happy
over the new job 
it s not a serious disturbance 
glabrus will be back 
maybe 
at least it gives me a chance   
to separate glabrus
from crassus for a while 
you know  this republic of ours
is something like a rich widow 
most romans love her
as their mother 
but crassus dreams of marrying
the old girl  to put it politely 
hail glabrus 
hail glabrus 
  god be with you  glabrus 
  and with you too 
i hope he returns
to such applause 
one fat one  fimbria 
no  keep the change 
give it to your wife 
  may the gods adore you 
  only through your prayers 
let s make an old fashioned sacrifice
for glabrus  success 
i thought you had reservations
about the gods 
privately i believe in none of them 
neither do you 
publicly i believe in them all 
greetings  marcus clodius flavius 
is marcus glabrus in attendance 
  he awaits you in the atrium  sir 
  excellent 
what have we here 
a gift from the governor
of sicily  sir 
antoninus 
sicilian  age 26 
singer of songs 
for whom did you practice
this wondrous talent 
for the children of my master   
whom i also taught
the classics 
classics  indeed 
what position have we  i wonder 
for a boy of such varied gifts 
you shall be my body servant 
instruct him 
all of you  come with me 
are you on guard duty 
my dear crassus 
congratulate me 
or better still 
let us congratulate each other 
i congratulate us 
tomorrow i lead six cohorts
of the garrison   
against the slaves on vesuvius 
the whole city
is turning out to see us off 
great merciful
bloodstained gods 
your pardon 
i always address heaven
in moments of triumph 
did gracchus have something
to do with this brilliant affair 
yes  he even proposed it 
rather decently  too 
and you  do you think i made you
commander of the garrison   
to control some rock patch
on vesuvius 
it was to control
the streets of rome 
i only take six cohorts 
the rest of the garrison remains 
  under whose command 
  under caesar s 
excellent  excellent 
finding gracchus in control
of the mob and the senate   
you felt compelled to hand over
the garrison to him also 
i see 
i ll refuse  i ll withdraw
from the expedition 
one of the disadvantages
of being a patrician   
is that occasionally
you re obliged to act like one 
you pledged the senate to go 
and go you must 
if gracchus should decide
to move against you  
he won t 
has no need to 
he has  with your assistance 
immobilized me altogether 
your legions are still in camp
outside the city walls 
my legions 
do you truly believe i d order
my legions to enter rome 
i only point out that
you can if you have to 
are you not aware
of rome s most ancient law   
that no general may enter the city
at the head of his armed legions 
  sulla did 
  sulla  to the infamy of his name 
to the utter damnation
of his line 
no  my young friend 
one day i shall cleanse this rome
which my fathers bequeathed me 
i shall restore all the traditions
that made her great 
it follows  then  that i cannot come
to power or even defend myself   
by an act which betrays
the most sacred tradition of them all 
i shall not bring my legions
within these walls 
i shall not violate rome   
at the moment
of possessing her 
go 
prepare your troops
at once 
march out of rome tonight 
but the city tribute is impossible 
we ve already been made to look a fool 
let s not add the trappings of a clown 
leave by unfrequented streets 
without fanfare  without even a drum 
sneak out 
as you wish 
and for heaven s sake 
my young friend   
try and see to it that you don t have
to sneak back again 
farewell 
come on  fat boy 
noble romans   
fighting each other
like animals 
your new masters 
betting to see who ll die first 
drop your swords 
i want to see their blood
right over here where draba died 
when i fight matched pairs 
they fight to the death 
i made myself a promise  crixus 
i swore that
if i ever got out of this place   
i d die before i d watch
two men fight to the death again 
draba made that promise too 
he kept it 
so will l 
go on  get out 
what are we  crixus 
what are we becoming 
romans 
have we learned nothing 
what s happening to us 
we look for wine
when we should be hunting bread 
when you ve got wine 
you don t need bread 
you can t just be a gang
of drunken raiders 
  what else can we be 
  gladiators 
an army of gladiators 
there s never been
an army like that 
one gladiator s worth
any two roman soldiers that ever lived 
we beat the roman guards 
but a roman army s a different thing 
they fight different
than we do too 
we can beat anything they send
against us if we really want to 
  it takes a big army for that 
  we ll have a big army 
once we re on the march   
we ll free every slave
in every town and village 
can anybody get
a bigger army than that 
once we cross the alps 
we re safe 
nobody can cross the alps  every pass
is defended by its own legion 
there s only one way
to get out of this country 
the sea 
what good is the sea
if you have no ships 
the cilician pirates have ships 
they re at war with rome 
every roman galley that sails
out of brundusium pays tribute to them 
they ve got the biggest fleet
in the world 
i was a galley slave with them  they ll
take you anywhere for enough gold 
we haven t got enough gold 
take every roman we capture
and warm his back a little 
  we ll have gold  all right 
  spartacus is right 
let s hire these pirates
and march straight to brundusium 
come join us 
all of you  come join us 
come on and join us 
back to vesuvius 
varinia 
i thought
i d never see you again 
everything s so different 
the last time i saw you   
you were waiting
in the arena to  
i thought
you were in rome 
how d you escape 
i jumped out of the cart   
and batiatus was so fat  
i flew out of the cart   
and batiatus was so fat   
that he couldn t catch me 
he couldn t catch up with me 
do you realize   
nobody can ever sell you again 
nobody can sell you 
  or give you away 
  or give you away 
nobody can ever make you
stay with anybody 
nobody can make you
stay with anybody 
i love you  spartacus 
i love you 
i still can t believe it 
forbid me ever to leave you 
i do forbid you 
i forbid you 
it was funny at the time 
i wish he d heard it 
how good you are to me 
if i may say so 
  you may 
  thank you 
don t just eye those birds 
eat them 
there s no need to be
on your best behaviour here 
may i remind you   
you ve been very good to me
in the past 
i ve been good to you 
yes  you ve sold me slaves
at an extremely reasonable price 
and you arranged private gladiatorial
jousts at cost  or practically 
on the whole  you are both
ethical in business matters   
and certainly farsighted socially 
zenobia s put on a little weight
since i last saw her 
  yes  hasn t she  i like it 
  so do l 
you and i have a tendency
towards corpulence 
corpulence makes a man reasonable 
pleasant and phlegmatic 
have you noticed the nastiest
of tyrants are invariably thin 
in spite of your vices  you are
the most generous roman of our time 
vices 
the ladies 
ladies 
since when are they a vice 
perhaps i used the wrong word 
an eccentricity  a foible 
i hope i pronounced that word  
it s well known that even your groom
and your butler are women 
i m the most virtuous man in rome 
i keep these women
out of my respect for roman morality 
that morality  which has made
rome strong enough to steal   
two thirds of the world
from its rightful owners   
founded on the sanctity
of roman marriage and family 
i happen to like women 
i have a promiscuous nature   
and  unlike these aristocrats 
i will not take a marriage vow   
which i know my nature
will prevent me from keeping 
you have too great a respect
for the purity of womankind 
exactly 
it must be tantalizing
to be surrounded by so much purity 
it is 
now  let s mix business with pleasure 
how may i help you 
great gracchus 
i find it difficult to hate   
but there s one man i can t think of
without fuming 
  who s that 
  crassus 
  you ve grown ambitious in your hatred 
  do you blame me 
there i was  better than
a millionaire in the morning   
and a penniless refugee
by nightfall   
with nothing but these rags
and my poor flesh to call my own 
all because crassus decides
to break his journey at capua   
with a couple of capricious 
over painted nymphs 
these two daughters of venus
had to taunt the gladiators   
force them to fight to the death 
and before i knew what had happened   
revolution on my hands 
what revenge have you in mind 
i sold crassus this woman 
varinia 
  whom 
  varinia  may the gods give her wings 
there was no contract 
but she was clearly his slave   
as soon as
the deal was made 
now she s off with spartacus
killing people in their beds 
and crassus  
no mention of money  no 
you never offered me
this woman  why not  
well  she s not remotely
your type  gracchus 
  she is very thin and  
  look around you 
you ll see women of all sizes 
five hundred sesterces
deposit on varinia 
since he hasn t paid 
this gives me first call over crassus   
when she s caught and auctioned 
may the gods adore you 
why would you buy a woman
you ve never even seen 
to annoy crassus  of course 
and to help you 
fetch a stool  antoninus 
in here with it 
that will do 
do you steal  antoninus 
no  master 
do you lie 
not if i can avoid it 
have you ever
dishonoured the gods 
no  master 
do you refrain from these vices
out of respect for the moral virtues 
yes  master 
do you eat oysters 
when i have them  master 
do you eat snails 
no  master 
do you consider the eating
of oysters to be moral   
and the eating of snails
to be immoral 
no  master 
of course not 
it is all a matter
of taste  isn t it 
yes  master 
and taste is not
the same as appetite   
and therefore not a question
of morals  is it 
it could be argued so  master 
that will do 
my robe  antoninus 
my taste includes   
both snails and oysters 
antoninus  look 
across the river 
there is something
you must see 
there  boy  is rome 
the might  the majesty   
the terror of rome 
there is the power that bestrides
the known world like a colossus 
no man can withstand rome 
no nation can withstand her 
how much less   
a boy 
there s only one way to deal
with rome  antoninus 
you must serve her 
you must abase yourself
before her 
you must grovel at her feet 
you must   
love her 
isn t that so  antoninus 
  take your time 
  how are they coming 
good  give me another thousand like them
and we can march on rome 
come on  once again 
here on vesuvius 
we re safe from attack   
while we organize ourselves
into an army 
it may take six months 
it may take a year  we don t know 
once we re strong  we re gonna fight
our way south to the sea 
we re going to arrange for ships
with the cilician pirates 
then the sea will be a road
back home for all of us 
if you agree  you may join us 
if you don t agree  go back
before your escape is discovered 
too many women 
what s wrong with women 
where would you be now 
you lout   
if some woman hadn t fought
all the pains of hell   
to get you
into this accursed world 
i can handle a knife
in the dark as well as anyone 
i can cast spells
and brew poisons 
i have made the death shrouds
for seven roman masters in my time 
  you lout  i want to see spartacus 
  all right  grandmother 
i m spartacus  stay with us 
we ll need a million roman shrouds
before we re through 
where do you people come from 
most of us come
from the estate of lillius 
  what kind of work did you do there 
  sixteen years a carpenter and mason 
good  we can use carpenters 
  what kind of work did you do 
  i was a chief steward 
you ll help with the food supplies 
you ll report to the man patullus 
what kind of work did you do 
singer of songs 
singer of songs 
but what work did you do 
that s my work 
i also juggle 
juggle  what else do you do 
i can do feats of magic 
magic 
maybe he can make
the romans disappear 
i ll need one volunteer 
man or woman  how about you 
here we have a likely subject 
you ll notice there is
nothing in my hand  true 
  how many fingers do you see 
  three 
  how many fingers do you see 
  three 
i make a bowl 
my hand is upside down 
and i ask you to blow at it 
no  not hard enough  hard 
thank you 
would you like to try 
hit it against the rock  gently 
poet  i haven t had
an egg in days 
you haven t 
  here 
  thank you 
i m not going
to let mine get away 
  sing us a song 
  sing us a song  antoninus 
sing  antoninus 
when the blazing sun
hangs low in the western sky   
when the wind dies away
on the mountain   
when the song
of the meadow lark turns still   
when the field locust clicks
no more in the field   
and the sea foam sleeps
like a maiden at rest   
and twilight touches the shape
of the wandering earth   
i turn home 
through blue shadows
and purple woods   
i turn home 
i turn to the place
that i was born   
to the mother who bore me
and the father who taught me   
long ago  long ago   
long ago 
alone am l now  lost and alone 
in a far  wide  wandering world 
yet still when
the blazing sun hangs low   
when the wind dies away
and the sea foam sleeps   
and twilight touches
the wandering earth   
i turn home 
where d you learn that song 
my father taught it to me 
i was wrong about you  poet 
you won t learn to kill 
you ll teach us songs 
i came here to fight 
anyone can learn to fight 
i joined to fight 
  what s your name 
  antoninus 
there s a time for fighting 
and there s a time for singing 
now you teach us to sing 
sing  antoninus 
when the blazing sun
hangs low in the western sky  
you like him  don t you 
who wants to fight 
an animal can learn to fight 
but to sing beautiful things   
and make people believe them  
what are you thinking about 
i m free 
and what do i know 
i don t even know
how to read 
you know things
that can t be taught 
i know nothing 
nothing 
and i want to know 
i want to  
i want to know 
know what 
everything 
why a star falls
and a bird doesn t 
where the sun goes at night 
why the moon changes shape 
i want to know
where the wind comes from 
the wind begins in a cave 
far to the north 
a young god sleeps in that cave 
he dreams of a girl   
and he sighs   
and the night wind
stirs with his breath 
i want to know all about you 
every line   
every curve 
i want to know
every part of you 
every beat of your heart 
go on about the city
of metapontum 
what garrisons
will we find there 
there are two legions in the garrison 
some have been sent south  
set the litter down there 
where is this slave general 
dionysius  get the litter bearers
out of the rain 
give them food  bread 
and their freedom 
  all right  follow me 
  we ll pay you for them 
we have no slaves
in this camp 
tigranes levantus at your service 
my credentials 
come in 
 to the general of the italian slaves
called spartacus   
from ibar m hali  cilician governor
of the island of delos  
  sit down 
   greetings 
word has been received that you wish
to embark your armies   
on the cilician ships
from the italian port of brundusium 
  receive now my agent  tigranes   
  levantus 
 who bargains in my name 
may isis and serapis bring victory
to your cause  the governor of delos  
  who are isis and serapis 
  gods of the east 
why should they want us to win 
because they favour cilicia   
and cilicia  like you 
fights against the romans 
would you like some wine 
i drink only after the bargain
has been concluded   
never before 
how many ships
do these cilicians have 
five hundred at least 
but no deal is too small 
i assure you 
we ll need them all 
  all 
  what is the price 
price is 1 00 000 sesterces
per ship 
for 500 ships that would be   
50 million sesterces 
  you have such a sum 
  we will have 
see for yourself 
  beautiful 
  when will the ships be ready 
beautiful 
i love to see such beauty 
when will the ships be ready 
my friend   
when will you be ready 
how long will it take you   
to cross one third
the length of italy   
fighting a major battle
in every town 
one year  two years 
if we re not in brundusium
seven months from now   
we ll never be there 
what if we assemble the ships   
and there is no longer
a slave army to board them 
we ll give you a chest of treasure now 
the rest when we get to brundusium 
  this one 
  yes 
done  seven months from now 
the ships will be assembled 
arrange to have the chest loaded 
now  with your permission  i should
like to have the wine you offered me 
  will you join me 
  i will 
excellent workmanship 
it came from the estate
of a wealthy nobleman 
i ve heard that you are
of noble birth yourself 
i m the son
and grandson of slaves 
i knew that
when i saw you couldn t read 
of course  it pleases roman vanity
to think that you are noble 
they shrink from the idea
of fighting mere slaves   
especially a man like crassus 
  you know him 
  i entertained him one afternoon 
  you 
  in the arena 
excellent wine 
  may i ask you something 
  you can ask 
surely you know
you re going to lose  don t you 
you have no chance 
at this very moment  six cohorts
of the garrison of rome   
are approaching this position 
what are you going to do 
we ll decide that
when they get here 
let me put it differently 
if you looked
into a magic crystal   
and you saw your army destroyed
and yourself dead   
if you saw that in the future   
as i m sure
you re seeing it now   
would you continue to fight 
  yes 
  knowing that you must lose 
knowing we can 
all men lose when they die
and all men die 
but a slave and a free man
lose different things 
they both lose life 
when a free man dies 
he loses the pleasure of life 
a slave loses his pain 
death is the only freedom
a slave knows 
that s why he s not afraid of it 
that s why we ll win 
spartacus 
that pirate was right 
the garrison of rome 
they re setting up camp 
  how many are there 
  about six cohorts 
  where 
  at the mouth of the valley   
against the cliffs 
  strong camp 
  they have no stockade 
no stockade  are you sure 
  i m very sure 
  this campaign is great sport for them 
the romans are having a picnic 
  did they see you 
  no  we were hidden 
maybe we ought to join
this roman picnic 
form your men 
six cohorts 
a lot of arms and weapons   
to build our army with 
crixus always wanted
to march on rome 
now he doesn t have to 
rome s come to us 
half this way 
the rest over there 
stand up  the way
a noble roman should 
that s roman pride for you 
that s better 
what s your name 
marcus glabrus 
commander of the garrison
of rome 
commander 
he was commanding it on his belly
when we found him  playing dead 
you disappoint me 
marcus glabrus 
playing dead 
you afraid to die 
it s easy to die 
haven t you seen
enough gladiators in the arena   
to see how easy it is to die 
of course you have 
what are you going
to do to me 
i don t know 
  what should we do with him 
  let s have a matched pair  him and me 
i ll not fight like a gladiator 
you keep staring at this 
do you recognize this baton 
  yes 
  you should  it was in your tent 
the symbol of the senate 
all the power of rome 
that s the power of rome 
take that back to your senate 
tell them you and that broken stick is
all that s left of the garrison of rome 
tell them we want nothing
from rome 
nothing except our freedom 
all we want is to get out
of this damn country 
we re marching south
to the sea 
and we ll smash every army
they send against us 
put him on a horse 
their leader said
their hatred of rome was such   
that all they wished
was to escape from her rule 
if unopposed  he promised
a peaceful march to the sea 
if opposed  he threatens
to ravage the countryside   
and destroy every legion
sent against him 
and once they get to the sea 
they plan to take ship with cilician
pirates and return to their homes 
from which port do they
propose to embark 
i don t know 
but city garrisons
can t stand up to them 
if they are to be intercepted 
it s work for the legions 
what sort of a man is
this leader of the slaves 
i don t know 
i think they called him
spartacus 
is that name familiar to you 
yes  it does seem to be 
i can t place it 
after he talked to you 
what happened then 
i was tied to a horse
and lashed out of camp 
how many of your company
escaped 
fourteen have reported
thus far 
i myself was taken prisoner
in my own command tent 
the camp was thoroughly infiltrated
before an alarm could be sounded 
did you surround your camp
with moat and stockade 
no 
we arrived after sunset 
sentries were posted every ten paces 
there was no reason to expect
an attack by night 
then again  well  they  
continue 
they were only slaves 
i see 
i submit that publius marcus glabrus
has disgraced the arms of rome 
let the punishment
of the senate be pronounced 
if we punished every commander
who made a fool of himself   
we wouldn t have anyone left
above the rank of centurion 
but this is a case
of criminal carelessness 
six cohorts have been slaughtered 
crassus sponsored this young man 
let him pronounce sentence 
the punishment is well known 
let publius marcus glabrus
be denied   
fire  water 
food and shelter   
for a distance of 400 miles
in all directions from the city of rome 
one thing more 
glabrus is my friend  and i will not
dissociate myself from his disgrace 
i now lay down the command
of my legions   
and retire to private life 
good bye  crassus 
this is no time for a man of honour
to withdraw from public affairs 
  shame  shame 
  sit down 
this sort of heroic
public behaviour is nothing new 
i ve seen it before   we all have  
and i know the meaning of it 
  crassus acted on a point of honour 
  patrician honour 
no matter how noble
this looks from the outside   
i don t like the colour of it 
crassus is
the only man in rome   
who hasn t yielded to
republican corruption  and never will 
i ll take some republican corruption
along with some republican freedom   
but i won t take   
the dictatorship of crassus
and no freedom at all 
that s what he s out for   
and that s why he ll be back 
to the mother that bore me   
to the father that taught me   
to the god  
to the blue woods
and the purple shadows  l  
to blue shadows
and purple woods 
  spartacus  you frightened me 
  i m sorry 
  how long have you been there 
  a little while 
why didn t you say something 
you seemed so happy 
i didn t want to bother you 
i am happy 
spartacus  i ve been trying to remember
the song that antoninus sang 
is it blue shadows
and purple woods 
or is it purple woods
and blue shadows  or what is it 
i want to make love
to my wife 
spartacus  put me down  i m  
i don t care 
  you ve got  you ve  
  yes 
  you have to be gentle with me 
  why 
why  darling 
i m going to have a baby 
now put me down 
what 
a baby 
a baby  when 
in the spring 
  how  i mean  how do you know 
  i know 
a baby in the spring 
  i m gonna have a son 
  but it might be a daughter 
  why didn t you tell me 
  i just did 
you re cold 
here  get underneath this 
  did i hurt you 
  no  you didn t 
  i didn t mean to be so rough 
  why don t you kiss me 
this is the first time
i was ever going to have a baby 
a baby 
i m just the same
as i ever was  spartacus 
i won t break 
these slaves have already cost us
a thousand million sesterces 
if now they want to relieve us
of their unwelcome presence   
in the name of all the gods 
let them go 
impossible  they ve already infected
half of italy with this uprising 
if we permit them
to escape now   
this condition will spread
throughout the entire empire 
the republic   
is still weak
from 20 years of civil strife 
we re engaged in two wars 
one in spain
and the other in asia 
pirates have cut off
our egyptian grain supply   
and spartacus raids the commerce
of all south italy 
half the precincts of rome
are without bread 
the city is close to panic 
there are two things
we must do immediately 
confirm caesar as permanent
commander of the garrison   
and assign two legions   
to intercept and destroy spartacus
at the city of metapontum 
if we could only have had
batiatus in the other pot 
  now you re talking 
  varinia  wonderful meal 
a small piece of land
with a few goats on it 
the best wine in the world 
for wine you ve got to go to aquitania 
the sweetest grapes on earth 
come to lidya for wine 
that s the best 
the best wine comes from greece 
everybody knows that  even the romans 
no  lidya 
you re all wrong 
the best wine comes from home 
wherever it is 
i agree with you 
gentlemen 
  are there reports on metapontum 
  heralds are crying the news now 
we lost 1 9 000 men 
including commodius and his officers 
nineteen thousand 
have you estates in metapontum 
no  a son with commodius 
with your permission  good day 
we take five years
to train a legion 
how can this spartacus
train an army in seven months 
there s something wrong 
something very wrong 
  we should have an investigation 
  by all means  an investigation 
 where is spartacus now 
 he s nearing the seaport of brundusium 
i need a few moments
of the commander s time 
will you excuse us 
i hear you ve taken a house
in the fourth ward 
not a very splendid house either 
and you feasted 1 1  000 plebeians
in the field of mars 
it scarcely could ve
been called a feast 
for 200 years  your family
and mine have been members   
of the equestrian order
and the patrician party 
servants and rulers of rome 
why have you left us
for gracchus and the mob 
i ve left no one 
least of all rome 
but this much i ve learned
from gracchus  rome is the mob 
no 
rome is an eternal thought
in the mind of god 
i had no idea
you d grown religious 
that doesn t matter 
if there were no gods at all 
i d revere them 
if there were no rome 
i d dream of her   
as i want you to do 
i want you to come back
to your own kind 
i beg you to 
is it me you want
or is it the garrison 
both  tell me frankly 
if you were l  would you
take the field against spartacus 
  of course 
  why 
we have no other choice
if we re to save rome 
caesar 
which rome 
theirs   
or ours 
you know gracchus
is my friend 
i won t betray him 
caesar 
which is worse  to betray a friend
or to betray rome herself 
my dear crassus 
i face no such choice 
you will 
sooner than you think 
good afternoon  crassus 
i ve been looking for you all day 
your new master 
the senate s been in session all day
over this business of spartacus 
we ve got eight legions to march
against him and no one to lead them 
the minute you offer
the generals command   
they start wheezing
like winded mules 
i ve seen such epidemics before 
haven t you 
  how s your health 
  excellent  as you know 
i take it the senate s now offering
command of the legions to me 
  you ve been expecting it 
  i have 
but have you thought how costly
my services might be 
we buy everything else
these days 
no reason why we shouldn t be charged
for patriotism  what s your fee 
my election as first consul 
command of all the legions of italy   
and the abolition of senatorial
authority over the courts 
dictatorship 
order 
  advise me if my terms are acceptable 
  i can tell you now 
  they re unacceptable 
  yes  i know 
for the present perhaps  but times
change  and so does the senate 
when that day comes 
i shall be ready 
  convey my respects to your wife 
  with pleasure 
he s right  you know 
if something isn t done about spartacus 
the senate will change 
and crassus will move in
and save rome from the slave army   
by assuming dictatorship 
but that  like everything else 
depends on which way spartacus jumps 
just now  he s trying
to get out of italy 
if he succeeds 
the crisis is over   
and crassus may stay
in retirement indefinitely 
i ve arranged for spartacus
to escape from italy 
you ve done what 
i ve made a little deal
with the cilician pirates 
i ve assured them
that we won t interfere   
if they transport spartacus
and his slaves out of italy 
so now we deal with pirates 
we bargain with criminals 
don t you be so stiff necked about it 
politics is a practical profession 
if a criminal has what you want 
you do business with him 
how far are we from brundusium 
about 20 miles 
our army will have to camp here tonight 
they re still about six hours behind us 
patullus  ride ahead to brundusium 
bring tigranes here 
marco  report back to spartacus 
tell him we camp tonight
by the sea 
if all goes well  my estimate is
we can load 1 50 ships a day 
that s your job  dionysius 
work with the cilician pirates 
  that oughta keep him busy 
  saves me finding someplace to sleep 
crixus  keep giving me reports
on pompey 
there won t be any surprises 
i still want patrols of
the back country until we board ship 
i ll get them together now 
spartacus  the harbour district
in brundusium has food warehouses   
but not enough to provide
for the whole fleet 
the countryside s filled with cattle 
and we ve more than enough salt
to preserve them 
i ll handle it 
find out how many men we have in camp
who were galley slaves or sailors 
tigranes levantus 
  my dear general 
  welcome  tigranes 
no  no  you needn t look
for litter bearers to emancipate 
i rode a horse 
your gods isis and serapis
must ve been good to us 
the balance of the 50 million sesterces
we owe you 
general   
i bear a heavy burden
of evil tidings 
what is it 
pompey and his army
has landed in italy 
at the border of rhegium
three days ago 
we get complete reports
on their movements 
but do you also know   
that a roman fleet carrying
lucullus and his army   
arrives tomorrow at brundusium 
  lucullus here 
  you have no ships 
i saw them in the harbour 
the cilician fleet 
out of strategic necessity   
has been obliged to withdraw 
  withdraw 
  there are no ships at all 
cilician pirates can destroy
any roman fleet that ever sailed 
if they run away now 
it s not because they re afraid 
you better give me
a better reason 
i m as desolated
as you are  general 
stand up  up 
on your toes 
  you ll cut the skin 
  why did the cilicians run away 
they were paid 
and who paid them 
who 
crassus 
crassus won t fight us himself 
the reports say he won t take
the command of an army 
why would he bribe your pirates
to keep us from escaping 
i don t know  how can i answer
when there is no answer 
i ve been betrayed 
just as you have 
there is an answer 
there must be an answer
to everything 
we re five miles
from brundusium 
here s rhegium 
pompey s march must have
brought him to about here 
he s four days away 
maybe more 
lucullus lands
at brundusium tomorrow 
if we engage lucullus   
pompey will have enough time
to march against our rear 
if we turn west
to meet pompey   
lucullus will march
against our rear 
the only other army
in all of italy is here 
rome 
yes  of course 
crassus is inviting us
to march on rome   
so he can take the field
against us 
you mean crassus wants us
to march on rome 
he s forcing us to  he knows
i won t let myself be trapped   
between two armies
with my back to the sea 
he knows my only other choice
is rome 
somewhere on the way 
we meet 
if he beats us 
he becomes the saviour of rome   
and there s his final victory
over the senate 
general  allow me
to redeem myself in your eyes 
for a very small commission   
i can arrange for you  your family
and your leaders  of course   
to be smuggled out of italy and
transported to an eastern country   
where men of substance like you
are welcome and appreciated 
you can live there like kings
for the rest of your lives 
what do you think  general 
go away 
go away 
tell the trumpeters
to sound assembly 
tonight a roman army lands
in the harbour of brundusium 
another army is approaching
us from the west 
between them 
they hope to trap us here   
against the sea 
the cilician pirates have betrayed us 
we have no ships 
 by order of the senate   
be it known that we have
this day elected   
marcus licinius crassus   
first consul of the republic   
and commander in chief
of the armies of rome  
hail crassus 
rome will not allow us
to escape from italy 
we have no choice
but to march against rome herself   
and end this war the only way
it could have ended 
by freeing every slave in italy 
i promise you   
a new rome   
a new italy
and a new empire 
i promise the destruction
of the slave army   
and the restoration of order   
throughout all our territories 
i d rather be here 
a free man among brothers   
facing a long march
and a hard fight   
than to be the richest citizen
of rome   
fat with food
he didn t work for   
and surrounded by slaves 
i promise the living body
of spartacus   
for whatever punishment
you may deem fit 
that or his head 
this i vow by the spirits
of all my forefathers 
this i have sworn   
in the temple
that guards their bones 
hail crassus 
we ve travelled
a long ways together 
we ve fought many battles
and won great victories 
now  instead of taking ship
for our homes across the sea   
we must fight again 
maybe there s no peace
in this world   
for us or for anyone else 
i don t know 
but i do know   
that as long as we live   
we must stay true to ourselves 
i do know that we re brothers 
and i know that we re free 
we march tonight 
hail crassus 
greetings to you  crassus 
caius  gentlemen 
have your dispositions
been made 
each maniple knows its position in line 
sir  and exactly what s expected 
every legion commander
has been given his battle orders 
excellent  all positions
will now be changed 
changed 
spartacus takes too keen
an interest in our plans  i fear 
new battle orders
will be issued in a short while 
spartacus has every reason to believe
that he has outdistanced   
the pursuing armies
of pompey and of lucullus 
however  there are passes
through the apennine mountains   
unknown to any map 
it may fortify
your courage to know   
that pompey is at this moment encamped
some 20 miles to the west of us   
and that the army of lucullus
approaches from the south   
by forced night march 
sir  allow us to pledge you the most
glorious victory of your career 
i m not after glory 
i m after spartacus 
and  gentlemen 
i mean to have him 
however  this campaign
is not alone to kill spartacus 
it is to kill
the legend of spartacus 
you may go  gentlemen 
hail crassus 
lentulus batiatus
awaits your excellency 
  who 
  the lanista  sir 
admit him 
most blessed highness 
as soon as i received your message   
i hurried into your
distinguished presence 
i m glad you were able
to spare the time  sit down 
how gracious 
i understand  
i m informed  
that spartacus once trained
under your auspices 
yes  in fact   
if it isn t too subversive
to say so   
i made him
what he is today 
you re to be congratulated
indeed 
i  too  as it happens  since you re
so admirably qualified to give me   
what up to now
i ve not been able to obtain 
a physical description
of spartacus 
yes 
but you saw him 
  what 
  in the ring 
when 
when you visited my school
with those two charming ladies 
what  
i trust they re both
in good health 
they selected him to fight
against draba  the negro 
  i remember the negro 
  you had good cause to  if i remember  
if i may say so  your excellency 
a brilliant dagger thrust 
difficult angle 
  spartacus was the opponent 
  yes 
what did he look like 
that s a matter of some
importance to your highness 
yes  to every man who loves rome
and wishes to see her strong 
we re both roman patriots  sir 
you re a great one 
i  of course  smaller 
but we both believe
in roman fair play 
if you want
something from me   
i would be lacking
in respect for my own conscience   
if i did not say
that i wish something from you 
name your price 
if   no  
when you win
your victory tomorrow   
presumably the survivors
will be auctioned off   
in order to pay for the expenses
of this heroic expedition 
could not the agent
for that sale be he   
who shares this tiny moment
of history with your honour 
i authorize you to be the agent
for the sale of all survivors 
in return  you will remain here with us
until after the battle   
and aid me
in identifying spartacus 
after the battle 
you misunderstand me 
i m a civilian 
i m even more of a civilian
than most civilians 
if you wish to remain so   
i should strongly advise you
to stay here and be our guest 
guard 
my dear  all conquering
marcus licinius crassus   
what if it is spartacus
who crosses the battlefield   
looking for you 
in such circumstances 
i have no doubt   
you will be helping him 
this fellow remains with us
until after the battle 
make him comfortable 
don t let him feel lonely 
mommy  mommy 
when do we go home 
go to sleep  dear 
no pains yet 
he s a bad child  though 
he hits me with his fist 
he wants to see his mother 
can you blame him 
can you feel it 
no  i don t 
i hope he waits
till we get to rome 
rome 
they ve never beaten us yet 
no 
but no matter how many times
we beat them   
they still seem to have
another army to send against us 
and another 
varinia  it just seems
like we ve started something   
that has no ending 
if it ended tomorrow 
it would be worth it 
varinia  don t make me weak 
you re strong enough
to be weak 
i love you more than my life 
yet  sometimes  even with you here
sleeping beside me   
i feel so alone 
i imagine a god for slaves   
and i pray 
what do you pray for 
i pray for a son
who ll be born free 
i pray for the same thing 
take care of my son  varinia 
if he never knows me   
tell him who i was
and what we dreamed of 
tell him the truth  there will be
plenty of others to tell him lies 
i can t live without you 
spartacus 
for you and me
there can be no farewells 
as long as one of us lives   
we all live 
i felt it  did you feel it 
  yes  i did 
  that was so strong  does it hurt you 
that was so strong 
lucullus and pompey 
have we a count of prisoners 
we haven t made
the final count  sir 
i bring a message
from your master   
marcus licinius crassus   
commander of italy 
by command of
his most merciful excellency   
your lives are to be spared 
slaves you were   
and slaves you remain 
but the terrible penalty
of crucifixion   
has been set aside   
on the single condition
that you identify the body   
or the living person
of the slave called spartacus 
  i m spartacus 
  i m spartacus 
forgive me for being one of the last
to congratulate you  your nobility 
there s an ugly rumour
going round the camp   
that the prisoners
are to be crucified 
that is true 
perhaps this is the moment
to remind your highness   
that yesterday you promised me i could
be the agent in their auctioning 
last night you promised
spartacus to me  where is he 
in return  i promised you
the sale of the survivors   
and there will be none 
  it s varinia 
  yes  i remember 
you re the woman of spartacus 
i m his wife 
and this is his child 
yes 
where is spartacus 
dead 
did you see him killed 
yes 
you re lying  where is he 
at least here is someone
worth selling  your enormity 
i ll even take the child
as an investment 
  how many women have been taken 
  under forty  sir 
most of those who weren t killed have
run to the hills with their children 
you may sell all the others 
but not this woman 
but you haven t seen
the others  your magnitude 
they re of surpassing ugliness 
a genius wouldn t be able to sell them 
flog that scoundrel out of camp 
this woman and her child
are to be conveyed to my house in rome 
  halt them 
  halt 
antoninus 
tribune 
slaves are to be crucified
along the roadside   
the whole distance between here
and the gates of rome 
hold this man till the end 
and that man too 
  march on 
  march on 
i ve more stripes on my back
than a zebra 
every time i touch my wounds   
they sing like larks 
but in spite of that 
i think i ve found something   
  i never had before with all my wealth 
  what is that 
don t laugh at me 
but i believe it to be dignity 
in rome 
dignity shortens life   
even more surely than disease 
the gods must be saving you
for some great enterprise 
you think so 
anyone who believes i ll turn informer
for nothing is a fool 
i bore the whip
without complaint 
yes  indeed  that sounds
like a bad attack of dignity 
i hope  however 
this will not deflect you   
from the revenge
you were going to take on crassus 
no  on the contrary 
it only strengthens my resolve 
i m glad to learn that 
this woman varinia is in his house 
all rome knows about it 
malicious tongues even say   
that he s in love
for the first time in his life 
i noticed a strange look in his eye
when he first saw her 
it would take a great woman   
to make crassus
fall out of love with himself 
i ll be honest with you 
gracchus 
she s not as unattractive
as i told you she was 
dignity and honesty in one afternoon 
i hardly recognize you 
  but she is an impossible woman 
  beautiful 
beautiful  well  beautiful 
the more chains you put on her 
the less like a slave she looks 
  proud 
  proud  proud 
you d feel that she would surrender
to the right man   
which is irritating 
i like crassus 
let s save him from his agony 
let s steal this woman 
steal the woman  why 
i can no longer hurt crassus
in the senate   
but i can hurt him where
he ll feel it most  in his pride 
attack our enemy from within 
the scheme is excellent   
but i hope you re not suggesting
that i steal the woman 
yes 
buy some horses
and a cart with a canopy 
bring her here by nightfall 
add courage
to your newfound virtues 
would half a million sesterces
make you brave 
half a million 
crassus does seem to dwindle
in the mind  but  
let s reduce him still further 
a round million 
a million 
for such a sum 
i could bribe jupiter himself 
with a lesser sum  i have 
forgive the intrusion 
you know i m not in the habit
of coming into your house uninvited 
you ve always been welcome here   
as a pupil 
  you re not alone 
  no 
this time you ve come to teach 
you ve joined crassus 
  am i arrested 
  no 
but i must ask you to come with me
to the senate immediately 
what i do 
i do not for myself   
but for rome 
poor helpless rome 
let s go and hear more
about rome from crassus 
did you truly believe
500 years of rome   
could so easily be delivered
into the clutches of a mob 
already the bodies
of 6 000 crucified slaves   
line the appian way 
tomorrow the last of their companions
will fight to the death   
in the temple of my fathers
as a sacrifice to them 
as those slaves have died 
so will your rabble   
if they falter one instant
in loyalty to the new order of affairs 
the enemies of the state
are known 
arrests are in progress 
the prisons begin to fill 
in every city and province  lists
of the disloyal have been compiled 
tomorrow they will learn
the cost of their terrible folly   
their treason 
where does my name appear   
on the list of disloyal enemies
of the state 
first 
yet upon you i have
no desire for vengeance 
your property
shall not be touched 
you will retain the rank
and title of roman senator 
a house   
a farmhouse in picenum
has been provided for your exile 
you may take your women
with you 
why am i to be left
so conspicuously alive 
your followers are
deluded enough to trust you 
i intend that you shall speak to them
tomorrow for their own good   
their peaceful
and profitable future 
from time to time thereafter 
i may find it useful   
to bring you back to rome
to continue your duty to her   
to calm the envious spirit   
and the troubled mind 
you will persuade them
to accept destiny and order   
and trust the gods 
you may go 
halt 
now  why hide
behind that stola  
that s better 
that dress took some weeks
of a woman s life 
you  above all people  should respect
the work of slaves and wear it proudly 
come here 
this belonged to a queen   
the queen of persia 
it s heavy 
in time you will wear it
lightly enough 
sit down 
will you have
some squab and honey 
no 
you ll enjoy it 
and a piece of melon 
and some wine  of course 
eat 
i did not command you to eat 
i invited you 
you find the richness
of your surroundings   
makes conversation difficult 
why am i here 
good question 
a woman s question 
i wish the answer could be
as good and straightforward 
  the infant   it thrives 
  he thrives 
i purchased a wet nurse
for him yesterday 
i hope milk agrees with him 
i sent her away 
i prefer to nurse
the child myself 
i m not sure i approve 
it ties you to the old life 
i want you to begin
to look forward to the new 
i don t care
about my new life here 
you care about the life
of your child  don t you 
why do you threaten me
with my baby 
i belong to you 
you can take me anytime you wish 
but i don t want to take you 
i want you to give 
i want your love  varinia 
you think by threatening
to kill my child   
you ll make me love you 
i did not threaten
to kill your child 
i m sorry  varinia 
one shouldn t grieve forever 
i m not grieving 
i m remembering 
do i interfere
with your memories 
no 
you tread the ridge
between truth and insult   
with the skill
of a mountain goat 
what do you remember
when you think about spartacus 
it doesn t distress you
to talk about him 
no 
well  then   
what sort of a man was he   
really 
he was a man
who began all alone   
like an animal 
yet on the day he died   
thousands and thousands
would gladly have died in his place 
what was he 
was he a god 
he wasn t a god 
he was a simple man 
a slave 
i loved him 
he was an outlaw 
a murderer 
an enemy to everything fine
and decent that rome ever built 
damn you  you tell me 
  why did you love him 
  i can t tell you 
i can t tell you things
you can never understand 
but i want to understand 
don t you see 
i must understand 
you re afraid of him 
aren t you 
that s why you want his wife   
to soothe your fear
by having something he had 
when you re so afraid 
nothing can help 
nothing 
we shall see 
could we have won 
spartacus 
could we ever have won 
just by fighting them 
we won something 
when just one man says 
 no  i won t    
rome begins to fear 
and we were tens of thousands
who said no 
that was the wonder of it 
to have seen slaves
lift their heads from the dust   
to see them rise
from their knees   
stand tall   
with a song on their lips   
to hear them   
storm through the mountains
shouting   
to hear them sing
along the plains 
and now they re dead 
dead 
varinia   
dead 
and the baby 
all of them 
are you afraid to die 
spartacus 
no more than i was
to be born 
are you afraid 
yes 
hail counsel 
guards  fall in 
  where are the gladiators 
  over there  sir 
antoninus  the night passes slowly 
doesn t it 
you are he   
aren t you 
gladiator 
i m marcus licinius crassus 
you must answer
when i speak to you 
centurion 
let them fight now 
unchain them 
the entire city s been told
they ll fight tomorrow   
in the temple of your ancestors 
they will fight now  for me 
here 
and to the death 
and the victor shall be crucified 
we will test this myth
of slave brotherhood 
unchain them 
form a circle 
don t give them
the pleasure of a contest 
lower your guard 
i ll kill you on the first rush 
  i won t let them crucify you 
  it s my last order  obey it 
let them begin 
i won t let them crucify you 
do you realize how long it takes
to die on the cross 
i don t care 
forgive me  antoninus 
i love you  spartacus 
as i loved my own father 
i love you   
like my son
that i ll never see 
go to sleep 
here s your victory 
he ll come back 
he ll come back
and he ll be millions 
i wonder what spartacus
would say   
if he knew that the woman 
varinia  and her child   
are slaves in my household 
yes 
crucify him 
i want no grave for him 
no marker 
his body s to be burnt
and his ashes scattered in secret 
did you fear him  crassus 
not when i fought him 
i knew he could be beaten 
but now i fear him 
even more than i fear you 
  me 
  yes  my dear caesar 
you 
i don t see the letter here
to the leader of the senate 
julia  i don t like
the sound of weeping 
this is a happy house 
please stop it 
there you are  go away  julia 
where have you been all this time 
the city is full of crassus  legions 
we ve been hiding 
i don t know rome
as well as i know capua 
they re arresting everyone 
so this is the woman   
it took crassus 
eight roman legions to conquer 
i wish i had time to make
your acquaintance  my dear 
unfortunately  we all have
to make journeys   
to different destinations 
  where are we going 
  you re going to aquitania 
the governor s one
of my innumerable cousins 
here s a senatorial pass 
it s valid in all the known world 
why do i have to go
to aquitania 
 cause i ask you to 
it s very good of you  gracchus 
but i d rather  
double the money i promised you 
here s two million sesterces 
two million 
here  articles of freedom
for the woman 
and here s a smaller document
that i ve prepared   
for the child
befitting its size 
where are you going 
to picenum 
picenum 
that s the dreariest town in italy 
will you please leave me 
come with us 
see to it that i don t misuse
the money 
don t be ridiculous 
i m a senator 
will you please go
before the soldiers come here 
this would really make
crassus jealous 
go and make
my joy complete 
save your tears now 
save them for the journey 
prettier 
halt 
identify yourselves  please 
  lentulus batiatus 
  climb down and identify yourselves 
  i object to that tone 
  i ve got my orders 
come down
and identify yourselves  please 
as i told you  i m lentulus batiatus 
the lanista from capua 
this  
my sister in law 
lady  please 
she s travelling   
with her child to aquitania
on a senatorial pass 
  take a look through his baggage 
  not a word  please 
what did you say 
  tell the lady no loitering s allowed 
  instantly 
move on 
this is your son 
he s free  spartacus 
free 
he s free 
he ll remember you  spartacus 
because i ll tell him 
i ll tell him who his father was
and what he dreamed of 
varinia  have mercy on us 
get in the wagon 
my love  my life 
please die  die 
please  please die  my love 
oh  god
