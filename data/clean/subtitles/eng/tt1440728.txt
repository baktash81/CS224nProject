mathilde
range
150175 meters
time
five seconds
seven at the most
targets
one
firing rate
rapid
magazine capacity
large preferably a 556
the weapon must be
fairly light and compact
how compact
as compact as possible
you want an automatic rifle
to fit inside a womans purse
a small vanity case
would be permissible
a small briefcase would be possible
noise
silencer
i can only give you a suppressor
itll dampen the decibels
and dislocate the sound source
and reduce the muzzle flash
i cant make you silent
but i can make you invisible
as long as youre willing
to lose some range
two oclock
light blue shirt sunglasses
is he with you
i didnt see him
in any case im alone
ecco il suo americano
grazie
i can accept a slight loss of range
you want a weapon
with the firing capacity
of a submachine gun
and the range of a rifle
can you do it
clarke
un pacchetto
clarke
grazie
see you tonight
all the sheep in my flock
are dear to me
but some are dearer than most
especially those that
have lost their way
fabio meccanico
car doctor
but i think his work
is not always legal
did you ever want to be
anything but a priest
have you ever wanted to be
anything other than a photographer
i do what im good at
you have the hands of a craftsman
not an artist
you are good with machines
yet you told me just the opposite
when we first met
hmm
journalism
cannot make you a rich man
perhaps you are rich already
a man can be rich
if he has god in his heart
i dont think gods
very interested in me father
fabio
ive got some damage to my car
sì
im taking photographs in the mountains
okay okay
no i need tools
for a broken drive shaft
my garage
your garage
sì grazie
quanto costa
grazie
hello again edward
does this place get many visitors
this is the only way
to get here
did you check it for
footprints and tire tracks
three days ago i walked the river
both sides
lets check again
rounds
i prepared two kinds
10 jacketed 10 expanding
id like 20 of each
and 10 explosive
not a problem will mercury do
mercury will do very nicely
i brought my own target
right there
muzzle velocity
about 360 miles an hour
thats including 20 miles an hour off
for the sound suppression
ruger
m14
ive not had one before
youll find it easy
ive rebalanced it
for the weight of the suppressor
the fulcrums two centimeters forward
from the grip
but that shouldnt matter
if youre firing
im assuming you are
from a fixed position
theres no major recoil issues
you should be able to hold any target
even the smallest
go to the flower
fire into these reeds
say two steps away from me
two bursts five seconds apart
the sound suppression is superb
i couldnt place the direction of fire
i shall require the rounds and the weapon
by the first of next month
in the meantime
could you tighten
the adjusting screws on the sight
theyre too loose
what about the case
its a briefcase samsonite
black combination locks
you have a number you prefer
014
014
what do you want done with these
how thoughtful
asprinio i dont know it
its like moscato
only frizzante
it wouldnt look right
if the picnic wasnt touched
you chilled the wine i thought
had to be chilled
italian cops
dont move
so beautiful
its endangered
you like coming here
it serves a purpose
youve never taken a woman
here before
no
perhaps you do not have
a woman in your life
thank you for a lovely day
mr butterfly
sergio leone
italiano
no
sì
its like you cant stop
thinking about something
or someone
you dont have to act
act
you might have to with other clients
but you dont have to with me
i want you to be exactly
who you are
i came here to get pleasure
not to give it
maybe i pretend very well
you give me more tips
than the other girls get
i dont sleep with the other girls
ciao signor farfalla

how the fuck did they know
i was here
because youve lost your edge jack
buongiorno
youre up early
i needed some air
i walk here to meditate
i thank god for certain favors
he has granted me
and i ask him to look after those
of my friends who are sinners
all men are sinners
some are greater sinners than others
but those who seek peace
have much sinning in their history
maybe
forgive me this is the priest
in me speaking but
you have done much sinning
signor clarke
and you still do
something happened here last night
everything ive done
ive had good cause to do
do you wish to tell me
to confess
yes
for what reason
for your own sake
perhaps i can pray for you
perhaps
i wonder how many bastards
have been made here
you work in metal
you were given some steel by fabio
the car doctor
where was he conceived father
fabio the car doctor
why do you ask me that
you have each others photos
you have each others eyes
was he conceived here under the trees at night
like all the other bastards
i do not remember signor
it was many years ago
in the end it is i
who confesses to you
do you want me to do the same
for your own good
you cannot doubt the existence of hell
you live in it
it is a place without love
perhaps i have no right
to wear these robes
but i do have a heart
full of a fathers love
something close to his heart
and for that i am
both grateful and happy
what do you have my friend
ciao
i was not sure you were coming
i wasnt sure you meant me to
certo che sì
buonasera buonasera
buonasera
