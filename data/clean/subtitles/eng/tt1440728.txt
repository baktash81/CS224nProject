time

seven at the most 
targets 
one 
firing rate 
rapid 
magazine capacity 
large  preferably a 5 56 
the weapon must be
fairly light and compact 
how compact 
as compact as possible 
you want an automatic rifle
to fit inside a woman s purse 
a small vanity case
would be permissible 
a small briefcase would be possible 
noise 
silencer 
i can only give you a suppressor 
it ll dampen the decibels
and dislocate the sound source
and reduce the muzzle flash 
i can t make you silent 
but i can make you invisible
as long as you re willing
to lose some range 
two o clock 
light blue shirt  sunglasses  
is he with you 
i didn t see him 
in any case  i m alone 
ecco  il suo americano

clarke 
grazie 
see you tonight 
all the sheep in my flock
are dear to me 
but some are dearer than most 
especially those that
have lost their way 
fabio  meccanico  
 car doctor  
but i think his work
is not always legal 
did you ever want to be 
anything but a priest 
have you ever wanted to be
anything other than a photographer 
i do what i m good at 
you have the hands of a craftsman 
not an artist 
you are good with machines 
yet you told me just the opposite 
when we first met 
hmm 
journalism
cannot make you a rich man 
perhaps you are rich already 
a man can be rich
if he has god in his heart 
i don t think god s 
very interested in me  father 
fabio 
i ve got some damage to my car 
sì 
i m taking photographs in the mountains 
okay  okay 
no  i need tools 
for a broken drive shaft 
my garage 
your garage 
sì  grazie 
quanto costa 
grazie 
hello again  edward 
does this place get many visitors 
this is the only way
to get here 
did you check it for
footprints and tire tracks 
three days ago i walked the river 
both sides 
let s check again 
rounds 
i prepared two kinds 
10 jacketed  10 expanding 
i d like 20 of each 
and 10 explosive 
not a problem  will mercury do 
mercury will do very nicely 
i brought my own target 
right there 
muzzle velocity 
about 360 miles an hour 
that s including 20 miles an hour off 
for the sound suppression 
ruger 
m14 
i ve not had one before 
you ll find it easy 
i ve re balanced it 
for the weight of the suppressor 
the fulcrum s two centimeters forward 
from the grip 
but that shouldn t matter
if you re firing 
i m assuming you are 
from a fixed position 
there s no major recoil issues 
you should be able to hold any target  
even the smallest 
go to the flower 
fire into these reeds 
say  two steps away from me 
two bursts  five seconds apart 
the sound suppression is superb 
i couldn t place the direction of fire 
i shall require the rounds and the weapon 
by the first of next month 
in the meantime 
could you tighten 
the adjusting screws on the sight 
they re too loose 
what about the case 
it s a briefcase  samsonite 
black  combination locks 
you have a number you prefer 
  014 
  014 
what do you want done with these 
how thoughtful 
 asprinio   i don t know it 
it s like moscato 
only frizzante 
it wouldn t look right
if the picnic wasn t touched 
you chilled the wine  i thought   
had to be chilled 
italian cops 
don t move 
so beautiful 
it s endangered 
you like coming here 
it serves a purpose 
you ve never taken a woman
here before 
no 
perhaps you do not have
a woman in your life 
thank you  for a lovely day  
mr  butterfly 
sergio leone 
italiano 
no 
sì 
it s like you can t stop 
thinking about something 
or someone 
you don t have to act 
act 
you might have to with other clients 
but you don t have to with me 
i want you to be exactly 
who you are 
i came here to get pleasure 
not to give it 
maybe i pretend very well 
you give me more tips
than the other girls get 
i don t sleep with the other girls 
ciao  signor farfalla 
  how are you 
  good  thank you 
this is my friend anna 
hi

buongiorno 
you re up early 
i needed some air 
i walk here to meditate 
i thank god for certain favors 
he has granted me 
and i ask him to look after those 
of my friends who are sinners 
all men are sinners 
some are greater sinners than others 
but those who seek peace
have much sinning in their history 
maybe 
forgive me  this is the priest 
in me speaking  but
you have done much sinning  
signor clarke 
and you still do 
something happened here last night 
everything i ve done 
i ve had good cause to do 
do you wish to tell me 
  to confess 
  yes 
for what reason 
for your own sake 
perhaps i can pray for you 
perhaps 
i wonder how many bastards 
have been made here 
you work in metal 
you were given some steel by fabio  
the car doctor 
where was he conceived  father 
fabio  the car doctor 
why do you ask me that 
you have each other s photos 
you have each other s eyes 
was he conceived here  under the trees at night  
like all the other bastards 
i do not remember  signor 
it was many years ago 
in the end it is i
who confesses to you 
do you want me to do the same 
for your own good 
you cannot doubt the existence of hell  
you live in it 
it is a place without love 
perhaps i have no right
to wear these robes 
but i do have a heart
full of a father s love 
something close to his heart 
and for that i am
both grateful and happy 
what do you have  my friend 
ciao
