there s more to see
than can ever be seen
more to do
than can ever be done
there s far too much
to take in here
more to find
than can ever be found
but the sun rolling high
through the sapphire sky
keeps great and small
on the endless round
it s the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
it s the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
life s not fair  is it 
you see  i   
well  i shall never be king 
and you   
shall never see
the light of another day 
adieu 
didn t your mother ever tell you
not to play with your food 
what do you want 
i m here to announce that
king mufasa s on his way 
so you d better have a good excuse
for missing this morning s ceremony 
oh  look  zazu 
you ve made me lose my lunch 
you ll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you 
he s as mad as a hippo with a hernia 
i quiver with fear 
now  scar  don t look at me that way 
help 
scar 
drop him 
impeccable timing  your majesty 
why  if it isn t my big brother
descending from on high
to mingle with the commoners 
sarabi and i didn t see you
at the presentation of simba 
that was today 
i feel simply awful 
must ve slipped my mind 
yes  well  as slippery
as your mind is 
as the king s brother 
you should ve been first in line 
well  i was first in line 
until the little hairball was born 
that hairball is my son
and your future king 
i shall practice my curtsy 
don t turn your back on me  scar 
oh  no  mufasa 
perhaps you shouldn t
turn your back on me 
is that a challenge 
temper  temper 
i wouldn t dream of challenging you 
pity  why not 
well  as far as brains go 
i got the lion s share 
but when it comes
to brute strength   
i m afraid i m at the shallow end
of the gene pool 
there s one in every family  sire 
two in mine  actually  
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions 
what am i going to do with him 
he d make a very
handsome throw rug 
zazu 
and just think 
whenever he gets dirty 
you could take him out and beat him 
simba 
dad 
come on  dad  we gotta go  wake up 
sorry 
dad 
your son is awake 
before sunrise  he s your son 
come on  dad 
you promised 
ok  i m up 
look  simba 
everything the light
touches is our kingdom 
a king s time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun 
one day  simba 
the sun will set on my time here
and will rise with you
as the new king 
and this ll all be mine 
everything 
everything the light touches 
what about that shadowy place 
that s beyond our borders 
you must never go there  simba 
i thought a king
can do whatever he wants 
oh  there s more to being king
than getting your way all the time 
  there s more 
  simba    
everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance 
as king  you need to
understand that balance
and respect all the creatures 
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope 
but  dad  don t we eat the antelope 
yes  simba  but let me explain 
when we die  our bodies
become the grass 
and the antelope eat the grass 
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life 
good morning  sire 
good morning  zazu 
checking in with the morning report 
fire away 
chimps are going ape
giraffe remain above it all
elephants remember
though just what  i can t recall
crocodiles are snapping up
fresh offers from the banks
shown interest in my nest egg
but i quickly said no thanks
we haven t paid the hornbills
and the vultures have a hunch
not everyone invited
will be coming back from lunch
this is the morning report
gives you the long and the short
it s every grunt  roar  and snort
it s not a tale i distort
on the morning report
what are you doing  son 
pouncing 
let an old pro show you
how it s done 
oh  the buffalo have got a beef
stay low to the ground 
ok  stay low to the ground 
not a sound 
saffron is this season s colour
seen in all the herds
take it slow 
one more step   
then   
this is the morning report
gives you the long and the short
every grunt  roar  and snort
not a tale i distort
on the morning report
that s very good 
  zazu 
  yes 
sir  news from the underground 
now  this time   
sire  hyenas in the pride lands 
zazu  take simba home 
can t i come 
no  son 
i never get to go anywhere 
oh  young master 
one day you will be king 
then you can chase those
slobbering  mangy  stupid poachers
from dawn until dusk 
hey  uncle scar  guess what 
i despise guessing games 
i m gonna be king of pride rock 
oh  goody 
my dad just showed me
the whole kingdom 
and i m gonna rule it all 
yes  well  forgive me
for not leaping for joy 
bad back  you know 
hey  uncle scar  when i m king 
what ll that make you 
a monkey s uncle 
  you re so weird 
  you have no idea 
so  your father showed you
the whole kingdom  did he 
everything 
he didn t show you what s beyond
that rise at the northern border 
well  no  he said i can t go there 
and he s absolutely right 
it s far too dangerous 
only the bravest lions go there 
well  i m brave  what s out there 
i m sorry  simba 
i just can t tell you 
why not 
i m only looking out for the
well being of my favourite nephew 
yeah  right  i m your only nephew 
all the more reason
for me to be protective 
an elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince  oops 
an elephant what 
oh  dear  i ve said too much 
well  i suppose you d have
found out sooner or later 
you being so clever and all 
just do me one favour 
promise me you ll never visit
that dreadful place 
no problem 
there s a good lad 
you run along now and have fun 
and remember 
it s our little secret 
  hey  nala 
  hi  simba 
come on  i just heard
about this great place 
simba  i m kind of
in the middle of a bath 
and it s time for yours 
mom 
mom  you re messing up my mane 
ok  i m clean  can we go now 
so  where are we going 
it better not be anyplace dumb 
no  it s really cool 
so  where is this really cool place 
  around the water hole 
  the water hole 
what s so great about the water hole 
i ll show you when we get there 
mom  can i go with simba 
what do you think  sarabi 
well   
please 
it s all right with me 
  yeah 
  all right 
as long as zazu goes with you 
no  not zazu 
step lively 
the sooner we get to the water hole 
the sooner we can leave 
so  where are we really going 
an elephant graveyard 
wow 
zazu 
right  so  how are we
gonna ditch the dodo 
oh  just look at you two 
little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna 
your parents will be thrilled 
what with your being
betrothed and all 
be what 
betrothed  intended 
affianced 
meaning    
one day  you two are
going to be married 
i can t marry her  she s my friend 
yeah  it d be so weird 
sorry to bust your bubble 
but you two turtle doves
have no choice 
it s a tradition
going back generations 
when i m king 
that ll be the first thing to go 
not so long as i m around 
in that case  you re fired 
nice try 
but only the king can do that 
well  he s the future king 
yeah  so you have to
do what i tell you 
not yet  i don t 
and with an attitude like that 
i m afraid you re shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king  indeed 
not the way i see it 
i m gonna be a mighty king
so enemies beware
well  i ve never seen
a king of beasts
with quite so little hair
i m gonna be the main event
like no king was before
i m brushin  up on lookin  down
i m workin  on my roar
thus far  a rather
uninspiring thing
oh  i just can t wait to be king
you ve rather a long way to go 
young master  if you think   
  no one sayin    do this 
  now  when i said that   
  no one saying   be there 
  what i meant was   
  no one sayin    stop that 
  but what you don t realise   
  no one sayin    see here 
  now  see here 
free to run around all day
well  that s definitely out 
free to do it all my way
i think it s time that you and i
arranged a heart to heart
kings don t need advice
from little hornbills for a start
if this is where
the monarchy is headed
count me out
out of service  out of africa
i wouldn t hang about
this child is getting
wildly out of wing
oh  i just can t wait to be king
everybody  look left
everybody  look right
everywhere you look  i m
standing in the spotlight
not yet 
let every creature
go for broke and sing
let s hear it in the herd
and on the wing
it s gonna be
king simba s finest fling
oh  i just can t wait to be king
oh  i just can t wait to be king
oh  i just can t wait
to be king
i beg your pardon  madam  but   
get off 
simba 
nala

are still in there 
there s only one way to know 
come on  let s go check it out 
wrong  the only
checking out you will do
  will be to check out of here 
  oh  man 
we re way beyond the boundary
of the pride lands 
look  banana beak is scared

and right now we are all
in very real danger 
danger  ha

i laugh in the face of danger 
well  well  well  banzai

i don t know  shenzi

and quite by accident

and that would make you   
the future king 
do you know what we do to kings

but you told me they re nothing but
slobbering  mangy  stupid poachers

you deliberately disobeyed me 
and what s worse 
you put nala in danger 
i was just trying
to be brave  like you 
i m only brave when i have to be 
being brave
doesn t mean you go
looking for trouble 
but you re not scared of anything 
i was today 
  you were 
  yes 
i thought i might lose you 
i guess even kings get scared 
  but you know what 
  what 
i think those hyenas
were even scareder 
cos nobody messes with your dad 
  come here  you 
  oh  no 
gotcha 
dad 
  we re pals  right 
  right 
and we ll always be together  right 
simba  let me tell you something
that my father told me 
look at the stars 
the great kings of the past
look down on us from those stars 
  really 
  yes 
so whenever you feel alone 
just remember that those kings
will always be there to guide you 
and so will i 
man  that lousy mufasa 
i won t be able to sit for a week 
it s not funny  ed 
shut up 
will you knock it off 
  well  he started it 
  look at you guys 
no wonder we re dangling
at the bottom of the food chain 
man  i hate dangling 
yeah  if it weren t for those lions 
we d be runnin  the joint 
man  i hate lions 
  so pushy 
  and hairy 
  and stinky 
  and  man  are they   
ugly 
surely we lions
are not all that bad 
oh  scar  it s just you 
we were afraid it was
somebody important 
yeah  you know  like mufasa 
  yeah 
  i see 
  now that s power 
  tell me about it 
i just hear that name and i shudder 
do it again 
it tingles me 
i m surrounded by idiots 
now  you  scar  i mean  you re
one of us  i mean  you re our pal 
charmed 
oh  i like that  he s not king 
but he s still so proper 
hey  did you
bring us anything to eat 
scar  old buddy  old pal  did ya 
i don t think
you really deserve this 
i practically gift wrapped
those cubs for you 
and you couldn t even
dispose of them 
well  you know   
it wasn t exactly like
they was alone  scar 
yeah  what were we supposed to do 
kill mufasa 
precisely 
i know that your powers
of retention
are as wet
as a warthog s backside
but thick as you are  pay attention
my words are a matter of pride
it s clear from
your vacant expressions
the lights are not all on upstairs
but we re talking kings
and successions
even you can t be caught unawares
so prepare for
the chance of a lifetime
be prepared for sensational news
a shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer
and where do we feature 
just listen to teacher
i know it sounds sordid
but you ll be rewarded
when at last i am given my dues
and injustice deliciously squared
be prepared
yeah  be prepared 
we ll be prepared  for what 
for the death of the king 
  why  is he sick 
  no  fool  we re going to kill him 
  and simba  too 
  great idea  who needs a king 
no king  no king
  idiots  there will be a king 
  but you said   
i will be king 
stick with me 
and you ll never go hungry again 
  yeah  all right 
  long live the king 
long live the king 
it s great that
we ll soon be connected
with a king who ll be
all time adored
of course  quid pro quo 
you re expected
to take certain duties on board
the future is littered with prizes
and though i m the main addressee
the point that i must emphasise is
you won t get a sniff without me 
so prepare for
the coup of the century
be prepared for the murkiest scam
meticulous planning
tenacity spanning
decades of denial
is simply why
i ll be king undisputed
respected  saluted
and seen for the wonder i am
yes  my teeth
and ambitions are bared
be prepared
yes  our teeth
and ambitions are bared
be prepared
you wait here  your father has
a marvellous surprise for you 
what is it 
if i told you  it wouldn t be
a surprise now  would it 
if you tell me

father son    thing

  you know about that 
  simba  everybody knows about that 
  really 
  oh  yes 
lucky daddy was there
to save you  eh 
oh  and just between us 
you might want to work on
that little roar of yours 
ok

simba  it s to die for 
shut up

simba  what have you done 
there were wildebeests 
and he tried to save me 
it was an accident 
i didn t mean for it to happen 
of course  of course you didn t 
no one ever means for
these things to happen 
but the king is dead 
and if it weren t for you 
he d still be alive 
what will your mother think 
  what am i going to do 
  run away  simba 
run  run away and never return 
kill him 
hey  there he goes 
so go get him 
there ain t no way
i m going in there 
what  you want me to come out
looking like you  cactus butt 
but we got to finish the job 
well  he s as good as
dead out there anyway 
and if he comes back  we ll kill him 
yeah  you hear that 
if you ever come back 
we ll kill you 
mufasa s death is a terrible tragedy 
but to lose simba 
who had barely begun to live   
for me 
it is a deep  personal loss 
so it is with a heavy heart
that i assume the throne 
yet out of the ashes of this tragedy
we shall rise
to greet the dawning of a new era
in which lion and hyena
come together
in a great and glorious future 
get out of here 
i love this  bowling for buzzards 
gets  em every time 
hey  timon  you better come look

that s the stupidest thing i ever
heard 
maybe he ii   
hey  i ve got it 
what if he s on our side 
you know  having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea 
so we re keeping him

  i can see what s happening
  what 
  and they don t have a clue
  who 
they ll fall in love
and here s the bottom line
our trio s down to two
the sweet caress of twilight
there s magic everywhere
and with all this
romantic atmosphere
disaster s in the air
can you feel the love tonight 
the peace the evening brings
the world  for once
in perfect harmony
with all its living things
so many things to tell her
but how to make her see
the truth about my past   
impossible  she d turn away from me
he s holding back  he s hiding
but what  i can t decide
why won t he be
the king i know he is 
the king i see inside 
can you feel the love tonight 
the peace the evening brings
the world  for once
in perfect harmony
with all its living things
can you feel the love tonight 
you needn t look too far
stealing through
the night s uncertainties
love is where they are
and if he falls in love tonight
it can be assumed
his carefree days
with us are history
in short  our pal
is doomed
isn t this a great place 
it is beautiful 
but i don t understand something 
you ve been alive all this time 
why didn t you come
back to pride rock
