theres more to see
than can ever be seen
more to do
than can ever be done
theres far too much
to take in here
more to find
than can ever be found
but the sun rolling high
through the sapphire sky
keeps great and small
on the endless round
its the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
its the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
lifes not fair is it
you see i
well i shall never be king
and you
shall never see
the light of another day
adieu
didnt your mother ever tell you
not to play with your food
what do you want
im here to announce that
king mufasas on his way
so youd better have a good excuse
for missing this mornings ceremony
oh look zazu
youve made me lose my lunch
youll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you
hes as mad as a hippo with a hernia
i quiver with fear
now scar dont look at me that way
help
scar
drop him
impeccable timing your majesty
why if it isnt my big brother
descending from on high
to mingle with the commoners
sarabi and i didnt see you
at the presentation of simba
that was today
i feel simply awful
mustve slipped my mind
yes well as slippery
as your mind is
as the kings brother
you shouldve been first in line
well i was first in line
until the little hairball was born
that hairball is my son
and your future king
i shall practice my curtsy
dont turn your back on me scar
oh no mufasa
perhaps you shouldnt
turn your back on me
is that a challenge
temper temper
i wouldnt dream of challenging you
pity why not
well as far as brains go
i got the lions share
but when it comes
to brute strength
im afraid im at the shallow end
of the gene pool
theres one in every family sire
two in mine actually
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions
what am i going to do with him
hed make a very
handsome throw rug
zazu
and just think
whenever he gets dirty
you could take him out and beat him
simba
dad
come on dad we gotta go wake up
sorry
dad
your son is awake
before sunrise hes your son
come on dad
you promised
ok im up
look simba
everything the light
touches is our kingdom
a kings time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun
one day simba
the sun will set on my time here
and will rise with you
as the new king
and thisll all be mine
everything
everything the light touches
what about that shadowy place
thats beyond our borders
you must never go there simba
i thought a king
can do whatever he wants
oh theres more to being king
than getting your way all the time
theres more
simba
everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance
as king you need to
understand that balance
and respect all the creatures
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope
but dad dont we eat the antelope
yes simba but let me explain
when we die our bodies
become the grass
and the antelope eat the grass
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life
good morning sire
good morning zazu
checking in with the morning report
fire away
chimps are going ape
giraffe remain above it all
elephants remember
though just what i cant recall
crocodiles are snapping up
fresh offers from the banks
shown interest in my nest egg
but i quickly said no thanks
we havent paid the hornbills
and the vultures have a hunch
not everyone invited
will be coming back from lunch
this is the morning report
gives you the long and the short
its every grunt roar and snort
its not a tale i distort
on the morning report
what are you doing son
pouncing
let an old pro show you
how its done
oh the buffalo have got a beef
stay low to the ground
ok stay low to the ground
not a sound
saffron is this seasons colour
seen in all the herds
take it slow
one more step
then
this is the morning report
gives you the long and the short
every grunt roar and snort
not a tale i distort
on the morning report
thats very good
zazu
yes
sir news from the underground
now this time
sire hyenas in the pride lands
zazu take simba home
cant i come
no son
i never get to go anywhere
oh young master
one day you will be king
then you can chase those
slobbering mangy stupid poachers
from dawn until dusk
hey uncle scar guess what
i despise guessing games
im gonna be king of pride rock
oh goody
my dad just showed me
the whole kingdom
and im gonna rule it all
yes well forgive me
for not leaping for joy
bad back you know
hey uncle scar when im king
whatll that make you
a monkeys uncle
youre so weird
you have no idea
so your father showed you
the whole kingdom did he
everything
he didnt show you whats beyond
that rise at the northern border
well no he said i cant go there
and hes absolutely right
its far too dangerous
only the bravest lions go there
well im brave whats out there
im sorry simba
i just cant tell you
why not
im only looking out for the
wellbeing of my favourite nephew
yeah right im your only nephew
all the more reason
for me to be protective
an elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince oops
an elephant what
oh dear ive said too much
well i suppose youd have
found out sooner or later
you being so clever and all
just do me one favour
promise me youll never visit
that dreadful place
no problem
theres a good lad
you run along now and have fun
and remember
its our little secret
hey nala
hi simba
come on i just heard
about this great place
simba im kind of
in the middle of a bath
and its time for yours
mom
mom youre messing up my mane
ok im clean can we go now
so where are we going
it better not be anyplace dumb
no its really cool
so where is this really cool place
around the water hole
the water hole
whats so great about the water hole
ill show you when we get there
mom can i go with simba
what do you think sarabi
well
please
its all right with me
yeah
all right
as long as zazu goes with you
no not zazu
step lively
the sooner we get to the water hole
the sooner we can leave
so where are we really going
an elephant graveyard
wow
zazu
right so how are we
gonna ditch the dodo
oh just look at you two
little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna
your parents will be thrilled
what with your being
betrothed and all
bewhat
betrothed intended
affianced
meaning
one day you two are
going to be married
i cant marry her shes my friend
yeah itd be so weird
sorry to bust your bubble
but you two turtle doves
have no choice
its a tradition
going back generations
when im king
thatll be the first thing to go
not so long as im around
in that case youre fired
nice try
but only the king can do that
well hes the future king
yeah so you have to
do what i tell you
not yet i dont
and with an attitude like that
im afraid youre shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king indeed
not the way i see it
im gonna be a mighty king
so enemies beware
well ive never seen
a king of beasts
with quite so little hair
im gonna be the main event
like no king was before
im brushin up on lookin down
im workin on my roar
thus far a rather
uninspiring thing
oh i just cant wait to be king
youve rather a long way to go
young master if you think
no one sayin do this
now when i said that
no one saying be there
what i meant was
no one sayin stop that
but what you dont realise
no one sayin see here
now see here
free to run around all day
well thats definitely out
free to do it all my way
i think its time that you and i
arranged a hearttoheart
kings dont need advice
from little hornbills for a start
if this is where
the monarchy is headed
count me out
out of service out of africa
i wouldnt hang about
this child is getting
wildly out of wing
oh i just cant wait to be king
everybody look left
everybody look right
everywhere you look im
standing in the spotlight
not yet
let every creature
go for broke and sing
lets hear it in the herd
and on the wing
its gonna be
king simbas finest fling
oh i just cant wait to be king
oh i just cant wait to be king
oh i just cant wait
to be king
i beg your pardon madam but

so whenever you feel alone
just remember that those kings
will always be there to guide you
and so will i
man that lousy mufasa
i wont be able to sit for a week
its not funny ed
shut up
will you knock it off
well he started it
look at you guys
no wonder were dangling
at the bottom of the food chain

yeah if it werent for those lions
wed be runnin the joint

and hairy
and stinky

oh scar its just you
we were afraid it was
somebody important
yeah you know like mufasa

im surrounded by idiots
now you scar i mean youre
one of us i mean youre our pal
charmed
oh i like that hes not king
but hes still so proper
hey did you

you really deserve this
i practically giftwrapped
those cubs for you
and you couldnt even
dispose of them
well you know
it wasnt exactly like
they was alone scar
yeah what were we supposed to do
kill mufasa
precisely
i know that your powers
of retention
are as wet
as a warthogs backside
but thick as you are pay attention
my words are a matter of pride
its clear from
your vacant expressions
the lights are not all on upstairs
but were talking kings
and successions
even you cant be caught unawares
so prepare for
the chance of a lifetime
be prepared for sensational news
a shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer
and where do we feature
just listen to teacher
i know it sounds sordid
but youll be rewarded
when at last i am given my dues
and injustice deliciously squared
be prepared
yeah be prepared
well be prepared for what
for the death of the king
why is he sick
no fool were going to kill him
and simba too
great idea who needs a king

stick with me
and youll never go hungry again
yeah all right
long live the king

well soon be connected
with a king wholl be
alltime adored
of course quid pro quo
youre expected
to take certain duties on board
the future is littered with prizes
and though im the main addressee
the point that i must emphasise is
you wont get a sniff without me
so prepare for
the coup of the century
be prepared for the murkiest scam
meticulous planning
tenacity spanning
decades of denial
is simply why
ill be king undisputed
respected saluted
and seen for the wonder i am

and ambitions are bared
be prepared

the king i see inside
can you feel the love tonight
the peace the evening brings
the world for once
in perfect harmony
with all its living things
can you feel the love tonight
you neednt look too far
stealing through
the nights uncertainties
love is where they are
and if he falls in love tonight
it can be assumed
his carefree days
with us are history
