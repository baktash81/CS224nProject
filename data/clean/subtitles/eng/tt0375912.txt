fucking get down get down now
and you stay down stay down
but it wasnt for me
then came the summer of love
hashish and lsd arrived on the scene
there were villains locked away for
12 years for robbing a bank of 10 grand
doing time with drippy hippies
doing 12 months
for smuggling two million quids
worth of puff
i mean work it out mate
were in the wrong fucking game
drugs changed everything
always remember that one day all
this drug monkeybusiness will be legal
they wont leave it to people like me
when they figure out
how much money there is to be made
not millions fucking billions
recreational drugs plc
giving people what they want
good times today stupor tomorrow
but this is now
so until prohibition ends
make hay while the sun shines
im not against it
im a businessman whose commodity
happens to be cocaine
ten years ago charlie was for pop stars
or a celebritys birthday bash
it was demonized by daily mail readers
getting drunk in naff wine bars
now theyre my biggest clients
this is clarkie double first at cambridge
in industrial chemistry
well hes got to pay off
his student loan somehow
today i only deal in kilos
depending which tariff you use
thatll cost you either 28 grand
or 15 years in prison
which is more time than a rapist
cest la vie
it is vital that we work
to a few golden rules
always work in a small team
keep a very low profile only deal with
people who come recommended
its like selling anything
washing machines
handmade shoes blowjobs
as long as you dont take the piss
people will always come back for more
thats not to say we dont weave that
magic that makes two kilos into three
but never be too greedy
know and respect your enemy
it is only very very stupid people
who think the law is stupid
and avoid like the fucking plague
loud attentionseeking
wannabe gangsters
in it for the glory to be a face
to be a name
hello slavo yeah this is duke
everythings sweet when can we meet
they dont mean to fuck up they just do
forgive me for stating the obvious
but stay away from the enduser
they are guaranteed to bring you trouble
as do guns
i hate guns and violence
but as some roman general once said
if you seek peace plan for war
morty and his assistant terry
they watch my back
morty learnt caution the hard way
he did ten years inside
hes my bridge to the criminal world and
he ensures that the traffic is one way
look theres amsterdam
and theres oofdorfedorfe
not a fucking clue
none of them speak english
get in the car im sure its that way
move up
i bet you its that way
weve already been that way
yeah but were gonna go that way again
give us the map
oh dont start the pair of you
its like being out with a pair of kids
all day youve been moaning
it cant be that difficult
how many fucking greenhouses
can there be
morty
terence
clarkie
very very important
pay your supplier prompt
in our case thats mr jimmy price
hes the top of the pyramid
pay him in full on time without fail
no short counts
you get no second chances
jimmy calls the shots
where the fuck is gene
i dont know ask me one on sport
what time does your watch tell
the same as yours
hes never late
shut the fuck up
patience
gene here is jimmys righthand man
been with him since way back
all the drugs and cash go through gene
jimmy trusts him with his life
by the way jimmy would like to see
you tomorrow for a spot of lunch
wait a minute is there a problem
why does everybody assume theres a
problem just because he wants a word
maybe hes grateful
he fucking should be
see you at stoke park at one
this is just so beautiful
we need to get in and out
of here sharpish
paul and the tide aint gonna wait
everyone likes to walk
through a door mark ed private
therefore have a good reason
to be affluent
i own a share
in a very successful letting agency
it gives me an honest income
looks good on the selfassessment
whereas years ago scallywags
were trying to get money out of banks
now your problem is
how to get your illgotten gains in
thats a job for mr singh
he does my laundry
and in a week
it will be ready for collection
in the form of a nice clean cheque
for a round million
the business is on the up and up
but ive always said
have a plan and stick to it
quit while youre ahead
so barring any fuckups
im leaving it all behind
no we got the parcel
yeah better than expected actually

a little bit slightly turbo this end
come on boys lively lively

mass murder ethnic cleansing
theyre lunatics
theyre wanted by the united
fucking nations think about that
lets get this clear
duke has absolutely sweet fuckall
to do with us understand
everyone in amsterdam
believes that he has
bandied your names about
what
word on the street is theyve unleashed
their top boy his name is
his party piece right
is lopping peoples heads off
then fetching them back to his boss
its all about honor and respect with
these headbanging nationalist outfits
they cant have it getting about that
anybody has took liberties with them
but we had nothing to do with
the acquiring of said merchandise
ok we accept that
but with you lot up here punting
this shipment how does it look
bad
you do know that were only
talking pennies an article
stolen goods
you wont want them then
sit down lah lets not be too hasty
me and him need to have a little think
dont think too long someones
gonna make a killing on these pills
they already have
thats the problem kidder
that prick dukes made us look
a bunch of fucking amateurs
i told you he was trouble but he aint
gonna drag me down with him
try gene again what a fucking showup
hes not answering mort
ok
try jimmy at home
you sure
will you fucking ring him
where are we going morty
back to that boatyard
somebodys about to get a fucking slap
yes morty about fucking time
paul
what a way to go an iron burning a hole
in your chest until your heart boils
paulie wouldve told him anything then
wouldnt he
you see thats what happens
when you do business with loons
clarkie have a sniff about make some
phone calls but really quietly
find out where the dukes holed up
were gonna need an insurance policy
whats the fucking idea of phoning me at
home and leaving messages you prick
jimmy it was an emergency
dont fucking call me jimmy
and whats the idea of telling duke
those pills aint worth shit
you dont know
the problems youve caused
and dont be leaving it to that pair
of ponces cody and tiptoes
to find that bitch charlie
i fucking told you to do it
are you listening

that was quick
the gaff is rotten in there
kinkys still here isnt he
didnt tiptoes tell you
tell me what have you let him go
no i havent hes in here
kinky
i still want to be paid
so if im correct you three gearheads
are gonna be clucking very soon
in fact youre gonna be climbing
the walls any minute arent you
but im prepared to do you a favor
we can do this one of two ways
we can do it the nice way
which i think youll prefer
because the other way
is my friend takes you
and puts your head
through the window
right so was charlie here with kinky
yeah she was here for a couple of days
kinky turned up with five grand
whos giving kinky five grand
we dont know
they kept arguing she was saying
do you think its that easy
taking the five grand
but she was still caning the rocks
where is she now
brighton she kept begging
kinky to go with her
the other night i hears this noise
im looking out there its dark
but i sees this geezer all in black
its like something out of a kungfu film
pay no attention to him hes a nutter
shut the fuck up
and you fucking tell him now

for old times sake
you look well flush bruv
fuck me hes loaded
here couldnt make it five could you
mate
lets make it ten
yeah
tens
a nice
round number
whats the matter
whats happening been away
yeah ten fucking years
going off or do you need a red light
stop morty enough hes had enough
ill tell you when hes had enough
what the fuck is this
but lets forget about all that
lets have a cup of tea mr hurst
what the fuck
im sorry about that
i wont be around for a while
its me
hey
come on up
ill leave the door open
hows your day been so far
very fucking funny
have you eaten
ill have a chinky sent up
no im fine thank you
gene who the fuck is freddie
he used to run with me morty and jimmy
in this real kamikaze firm
in those days we were headed up
by this guy called crazy larry
yeah got shot didnt he bit of a lunatic
thats an understatement
they were a spunout bunch
always doing loads of drugs
not worried about keeping a low profile
i love you
turn over anyone
who couldnt go to the law
no fucking problem boys will be boys
until one of them kilburn jerry
shoots himself stone dead
this is a bit of a dilemma
this desperate posse cant call the law
or an ambulance
morty out of some mad
fucking sense of loyalty
actually volunteered
to dispose of the body
no head but things went a bit wrong
the guy larry told to help him
was freddie hurst
the total imbecile
had fallen asleep at some traffic lights
in a drunk en druginduced stupor
morty was still shut up in the van with
the headless body of kilburn jerry
being black
was even worse than being irish
they threw the book at morty
freddie got three years
for aiding and abetting
morty did ten years because
freddie hurst fell asleep
but he kept his mouth shut
did his bird
earned a lot of respect for that
all because some kid was being ridden
against his will by a psychotic lunatic
who
but you you fuck
larry
crazy larry was gay
he was never gay
larry used to say
fucking females is for puffs
so who shot crazy larry
a boyfriend
probably
larry made enemies very easy took
liberties with too many straight lads
not for me
listen son let me explain
something to you
freddies in intensive care
with a bit of a brain hemorrhage
you were there at the scene
thats called joint venture
now if freddie dies
youre either in the dock with morty
or youre in the witness box
putting him away think about that
you know i will have one of those
all right fellas
wheres duke
i dont know
what do you mean
i dont know i thought he was here
well go and fucking find him
hes probably having a night out
while us mugs babysit these
gene what the fuck
am i gonna do about these serbs
come here i have something for you
youre gonna need one of these
fuck me gene
i fucking hope not are you trying
to scare the shit out of me
i mean i fucking hate guns
although that one is really pretty
is that second world war
hey point it upwards
oh for fucks sake
here let me see if its loaded
you look like
you could do that blindfolded
i can and i do
i find it very relaxing
good for meditation
meditation is concentrating the front
of the mind with a mundane task
so the rest of the mind can find peace
and you find peace with guns
well on occasion it has been known
listen i know its not your thing
but if you ever have to kill somebody
never ever tell a living soul
who is this
my name is dragan
how did you get this number
boatman paul gave me your number
in the end
i believe you have some property
that belongs to my employer
and youre the person i should talk to
about the return of this cargo
stolen by your associate the duke
dragan the duke
is nothing to do with me
mr duke came to amsterdam
used your name said he work ed for you
are you listening
dragan
ive got an idea why dont
you come round for breakfast
ill squeeze some orange juice
and well talk about this like adults
how does that sound

the pigs are everywhere
this was meant to be easy no sweat
calm down gazza
im sure dukes just fine
well youve got 48 hours to find a buyer
or im sending em back ok
now listen
dont do anything stupid gazza
it aint worth the grief weve gone
underground off the radar
nothing personal
but i dont trust you
listen i just had a phone call
from gazza
being a crybaby threatening
to offload those pills in 48 hours
between you and that gobshite duke
hes promised jimmy a bumper payday
so get busy
i said to jimmy id try and
he put yous together

if you two cant make music hes gonna
want his whack out either way

weve got to find the duke

one moment mr troop i want to hear
what this bastard has to say for himself
im jimmys old colleague eddie temple
fuck
he told you to locate my daughter
hunt her down like some lost mongrel
he said you asked for his help
mr troop could find anyone
on the planet in ten minutes flat
if youd laid a finger on my daughter
youd be over the edge like that
youd join that shit kinky
who thought he could take my five grand
and fuck me over
the audacity how fucking dare you
ive known jimmy price for 45 years
it pays me to keep an eye on him
do you know what a remora fish is
yes
oh you do
well jimmy has been swimming
in my slipstream all my fucking life
i thought he might put some
volatile psychopath on the job
but ive checked you out son
youre a smart boy
but you keep very very bad company
you know i host
a charity golf tournament every year
quite an event in the social calendar
if i do say so myself
i like to invite jimmy some of my friends
find him absurdly hilarious
drinks are on me drinks for everyone
champagne
fucking good gear and all
but ive come unstuck in my attempts
to provide a spectacle for my chums
jimmy as usual
on the look out for tidbits
has met the development minister
of some tinpot republic
theyre trawling the west
for investments
they have vast natural resources
quite an investment for the right man
theyve sent in men from timbuktu
explaining all the details
profits shares longterm investments
shortterm investments
theyve even made him an honorary
citizen even made him one of the tribe
what we didnt know
until it all ended in tears
was that the hardline
communist insurgents
who control the country
outside the mining areas
bad news about our little venture jim
the communists have broken through
heading for the capital
with little resistance
what the fuck are you on about
i got word they were planning a push
the final coup de grâce i told jimmy
its all over
fucks sake
keep your voice down
get my money out quick now
as if it was some little kiddies
piggy bank
now i explained that wasnt possible
we thought wed bought a government
maybe someone made a better offer
forget about it
you win some you lose some
how much are we talking
its only a cheeky halfmill jim
its much more than that
how much
13
13 what
13 million pounds im fucked
have you gone fucking mad
13 million pounds
how could you be so fucking stupid
youve been right grafted
royally turned over
like some yank buying london bridge
dont talk to me like that
he accused me of instigating it
its no coincidence
i met them at your tournament
are you fucking demented
asked me to fly to zurich
to see the minister
still parked up
in la maison grande still eating well
big fat fucker
on little jimmys nest egg
jimmy thought hed keep charlotte
hostage while you went to get his money
little jimmy was so stupid
he thought he couldnt lose either way
im sorry what
if you find charlotte
hes got his hostage
if i find you trying to find her
i do his dirty work
im still not with you
your lives are inextricably linked
ive found out something
very interesting about jimmy
something ive long suspected
but ill let jimmy explain
you follow me
youve no doubt suffered jimmys
cid was geezers you
was at school with routine
the other chaps albert carter
another twisted bastard
from the old neighborhood
member of the regional crime squad
sit back relax and enjoy
it aint like your lot in the old days
theyve all gone squeaky
tell me about it jim
i have to box clever with those
college boys from anticorruption
fucking dogs slags ten grand
its the going rate jim
ten k hardly seems worth the bother
well theres only so much
in those informer funds
what about gene
does he suspect anything
what about me working
for the old firm listen gene
is too loyal for his own good
i dont fucking believe it
you better believe it
cause its fucking happening
where did you get this
mr troop made it for me
its one of his little hobbies
i dont fucking believe it
dont you want to hear
what jimmy has to say about you
ive got one for you
pluck ed and ready for the pot
just give us a name and hes gone
in time
i dont want a bunce
i want him out of the way
flash young runt
one of the new breed aint he
reckons he can just waltz off
into retirement
i want him away for 12
if hes got a kilo of class a
hes looking at double figures
ill put it there myself
sounds personal
hes got a few quid
hell come in handy
i set him up with that slippery accountant
in the first place
fucking raghead let slip didnt he
you will miss him when hes gone
mr price
