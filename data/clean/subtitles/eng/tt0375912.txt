fucking get down  get down now 
and you  stay down  stay down 
but it wasn t for me 
then came the summer of love 
hashish and lsd arrived on the scene 
there were villains locked away for
12 years for robbing a bank of 10 grand 
doing time with drippy hippies
doing 12 months
for smuggling two million quid s
worth of puff 
i mean  work it out  mate 
we re in the wrong fucking game 
drugs changed everything 
always remember that one day all
this drug monkey business will be legal 
they won t leave it to people like me
when they figure out
how much money there is to be made  
not millions  fucking billions 
recreational drugs plc 
giving people what they want 
good times today  stupor tomorrow 
but this is now 
so  until prohibition ends 
make hay while the sun shines 
i m not against it 
i m a businessman whose commodity
happens to be cocaine 
ten years ago  charlie was for pop stars
or a celebrity s birthday bash 
it was demonized by daily mail readers
getting drunk in naff wine bars 
now they re my biggest clients 
this is clarkie  double first at cambridge
in industrial chemistry 
well  he s got to pay off
his student loan somehow 
today  i only deal in kilos 
depending which tariff you use 
that ll cost you either 28 grand
or 15 years in prison 
which is more time than a rapist 
c est la vie 
it is vital that we work
to a few golden rules 
always work in a small team 
keep a very low profile  only deal with
people who come recommended 
it s like selling anything  
washing machines 
hand made shoes  blow jobs 
as long as you don t take the piss 
people will always come back for more 
that s not to say we don t weave that
magic that makes two kilos into three 
but never be too greedy 
know and respect your enemy 
it is only very  very stupid people
who think the law is stupid 
and avoid like the fucking plague
loud  attention seeking
wannabe gangsters 
in it for the glory  to be a face 
to be a name 
hello  slavo  yeah  this is duke 
everything s sweet  when can we meet 
they don t mean to fuck up  they just do 
forgive me for stating the obvious 
but stay away from the end user 
they are guaranteed to bring you trouble 
as do guns 
i hate guns  and violence 
but as some roman general once said 
 if you seek peace  plan for war  
morty and his assistant terry 
they watch my back 
morty learnt caution the hard way 
he did ten years inside 
he s my bridge to the criminal world  and
he ensures that the traffic is one way 
look  there s amsterdam 
and there s oofdorfe   dorfe 
not a fucking clue 
none of them speak english 
  get in the car  i m sure it s that way 
  move up 
  i bet you it s that way 
  we ve already been that way 
yeah  but we re gonna go that way again 
give us the map 
oh  don t start  the pair of you 
it s like being out with a pair of kids 
  all day you ve been moaning 
  it can t be that difficult 
how many fucking greenhouses
can there be 
morty 
terence 
clarkie 
very  very important  
pay your supplier prompt 
in our case  that s mr  jimmy price 
he s the top of the pyramid 
pay him  in full  on time  without fail 
no short counts 
you get no second chances 
jimmy calls the shots 
where the fuck is gene 
  i don t know  ask me one on sport 
  what time does your watch tell 
  the same as yours 
  he s never late 
shut the fuck up 
patience 
gene here is jimmy s right hand man 
been with him since way back 
all the drugs and cash go through gene 
jimmy trusts him with his life 
by the way  jimmy would like to see
you tomorrow for a spot of lunch 
wait a minute  is there a problem 
why does everybody assume there s a
problem  just because he wants a word 
maybe he s grateful 
he fucking should be 
see you at stoke park at one 
this is just so beautiful 
we need to get in and out
of here sharpish 
paul and the tide ain t gonna wait 
everyone likes to walk
through a door mark ed  private  
therefore  have a good reason
to be affluent 
i own a share
in a very successful letting agency 
it gives me an honest income 
looks good on the self assessment 
whereas years ago scallywags
were trying to get money out of banks 
now your problem is
how to get your ill gotten gains in 
that s a job for mr  singh 
he does my laundry 
and in a week 
it will be ready for collection 
in the form of a nice  clean cheque
for a round million 
the business is on the up and up 
but i ve always said 
have a plan and stick to it 
quit while you re ahead 
so barring any fuck ups 
i m leaving it all behind 
no  we got the parcel 
yeah  better than expected  actually 
it s just that things have gone
a little bit slightly turbo this end 
come on  boys  lively  lively 
if we miss this tide  we re
not going anywhere till daylight 
paul  you ain t being paid to moan 
you re being paid to get my cargo home 
come on  babe  you all right 
careful here  it s a bit wobbly 
life is so fucking good 
i can taste it in my spit 
i ll treat tomorrow s lunch like a last
supper  feign interest in his tales 
and then leave quietly forever

mr  duke  believe me 
gazza  go and load them pills 
but he got unlucky because this lot
are wanted for fucking war crimes 
mass murder  ethnic cleansing 
they re lunatics 
they re wanted by the united
fucking nations  think about that 
let s get this clear 
duke has absolutely sweet fuck all
to do with us  understand 
everyone in amsterdam
believes that he has 
  bandied your names about 
  what 
word on the street is they ve unleashed
their top boy  his name is   
his party piece  right 
is lopping people s heads off
then fetching them back to his boss 
it s all about honor and respect with
these head banging nationalist outfits 
they can t have it getting about that
anybody has took liberties with them 
but we had nothing to do with
the acquiring of said merchandise 
ok  we accept that 
but with you lot up here punting
this shipment  how does it look 
bad 
you do know that we re only
talking pennies an article 
  stolen goods 
  you won t want them  then 
sit down  lah  let s not be too hasty 
me and him need to have a little think 
don t think too long  someone s
gonna make a killing on these pills 
they already have 
that s the problem  kidder 
that prick duke s made us look
a bunch of fucking amateurs 
i told you he was trouble  but he ain t
gonna drag me down with him 
try gene again  what a fucking show up 
  he s not answering  mort

  yes  morty  about fucking time 
paul

in your chest until your heart boils 
paulie would ve told him anything  then 
wouldn t he 
you see  that s what happens
when you do business with loons 
clarkie  have a sniff about  make some
phone calls  but really quietly 
find out where the duke s holed up 
we re gonna need an insurance policy 
what s the fucking idea of phoning me at
home and leaving messages  you prick 
  jimmy  it was an emergency 
  don t fucking call me jimmy 
and what s the idea of telling duke
those pills ain t worth shit 
you don t know
the problems you ve caused 
and don t be leaving it to that pair
of ponces  cody and tiptoes 
to find that bitch charlie 
i fucking told you to do it 
are you listening 
find a buyer for those pills 
the person moving those pills
met a nasty end 
i don t give a fuck

  the gaff is rotten in there 
  kinky s still here  isn t he

are gonna be clucking very soon 
in fact  you re gonna be climbing
the walls any minute  aren t you 
but i m prepared to do you a favor 
we can do this one of two ways 
we can do it the nice way 
which i think you ll prefer 
because the other way
is my friend takes you
and puts your head
through the window 
right  so  was charlie here with kinky 
yeah  she was here for a couple of days 
kinky turned up with five grand 
  who s giving kinky five grand 
  we don t know 
they kept arguing  she was saying 
 do you think it s that easy
 taking the five grand  
but she was still caning the rocks 
where is she now 
brighton  she kept begging
kinky to go with her 
the other night  i hears this noise 
i m looking out there  it s dark 
but i sees this geezer all in black

down this neck of the woods 
hello  freddie 
so   
   mr  mortimer 
here  morty  couldn t spare us a few quid 
for old times  sake 
you look well flush  bruv 
fuck me  he s loaded 
here  couldn t make it five  could you   
   mate 
  let s make it ten 
  yeah 
ten s   
   a nice   
   round number 
what s the matter 
what s happening  been away 
yeah  ten fucking years 
going off  or do you need a red light 
stop  morty  enough  he s had enough 
  i ll tell you when he s had enough 
  what the fuck is this 
but let s forget about all that 
let s have a cup of tea  mr  hurst 
what the fuck 
i m sorry about that 
i won t be around for a while 
  it s me 
  hey 
come on up 
i ll leave the door open 
  how s your day been so far 
  very fucking funny 
have you eaten 
i ll have a chinky sent up 
no  i m fine  thank you 
gene  who the fuck is freddie 
he used to run with me  morty and jimmy
in this real kamikaze firm 
in those days  we were headed up
by this guy called crazy larry 
yeah  got shot  didn t he  bit of a lunatic 
that s an understatement 
they were a spun out bunch 
always doing loads of drugs 
  not worried about keeping a low profile 
  i love you 
turn over anyone
who couldn t go to the law 
no fucking problem  boys will be boys 
until one of them  kilburn jerry   
   shoots himself stone dead 
this is a bit of a dilemma 
this desperate posse can t call the law
or an ambulance 
morty  out of some mad
fucking sense of loyalty 
actually volunteered
to dispose of the body 
no head  but things went a bit wrong 
the guy larry told to help him
was freddie hurst 
the total imbecile
had fallen asleep at some traffic lights
in a drunk en  drug induced stupor 
morty was still shut up in the van with
the headless body of kilburn jerry 
being black
was even worse than being irish 
they threw the book at morty 
freddie got three years
for aiding and abetting 
morty did ten years because
freddie hurst fell asleep 
but he kept his mouth shut 
did his bird 
earned a lot of respect for that 
all because some kid was being ridden
against his will by a psychotic lunatic 
  who 
  but you  you fuck 
larry 
  crazy larry was gay 
  he was never gay 
  larry used to say   
  fucking females is for puffs 
so who shot crazy larry 
a boyfriend 
probably 
larry made enemies very easy  took
liberties with too many straight lads 
not for me 
listen  son  let me explain
something to you 
freddie s in intensive care
with a bit of a brain hemorrhage 
you were there at the scene 
that s called joint venture 
now  if freddie dies 
you re either in the dock with morty
or you re in the witness box
putting him away  think about that 
you know  i will have one of those 
  all right  fellas 
  where s duke 
  i don t know 
  what do you mean 
  i don t know  i thought he was here 
  well  go and fucking find him 
he s probably having a night out
while us mugs baby sit these 
gene  what the fuck
am i gonna do about these serbs 
come here  i have something for you 
  you re gonna need one of these 
  fuck me  gene 
i fucking hope not  are you trying
to scare the shit out of me 
i mean  i fucking hate guns 
although that one is really pretty 
is that second world war 
hey  point it upwards 
oh  for fuck s sake 
here  let me see if it s loaded 
you look like
you could do that blindfolded 
i can and i do 
i find it very relaxing 
good for meditation 
meditation is concentrating the front
of the mind with a mundane task
so the rest of the mind can find peace 
and you find peace with guns 
well  on occasion  it has been known 
listen  i know it s not your thing 
but if you ever have to kill somebody 
never  ever tell a living soul 
  who is this 
  my name is dragan 
how did you get this number 
boatman paul gave me your number 
in the end 
i believe you have some property
that belongs to my employer 
and you re the person i should talk to
about the return of this cargo 
stolen by your associate  the duke 
dragan  the duke
is nothing to do with me 
mr  duke came to amsterdam 
used your name  said he work ed for you 
  are you listening 
  dragan   
i ve got an idea  why don t
you come round for breakfast 
i ll squeeze some orange juice
and we ll talk about this like adults 
  how does that sound 
  sounds very hospitable 
  do you know where i live 
  no 
well  fuck off  then 
duke s gone missing 
he s a fucking liability 
the pigs are everywhere 
this was meant to be easy  no sweat 
calm down  gazza 
i m sure duke s just fine 
well  you ve got 48 hours to find a buyer
or i m sending  em back  ok 
now  listen 
don t do anything stupid  gazza 
it ain t worth the grief  we ve gone
underground  off the radar 
nothing personal 
but i don t trust you 
listen  i just had a phone call
from gazza 
being a cry baby  threatening
to offload those pills in 48 hours 
between you and that gobshite duke 
he s promised jimmy a bumper pay day 
  so get busy 
  i said to jimmy i d try and   
he put yous together 
you and duke  that s his job 
if you two can t make music  he s gonna
want his whack out either way 
that s business 
  i hope you put this dragan straight 
  yeah  i told him to fuck off 
what  please tell me
you re fucking joking 
well  i am beginning to regret it now 
we ve got to find the duke 
find these fucking pills 
we can t rely
on these monkeys to call gene 
we ve looked everywhere 
there s no sign 
you can t find any of his firm 
maybe this dragan geezer s already found
the duke and done the business 
yeah  well  there is someone i can call 
keep looking 
wait  you re gonna leave it to us 
this dragan geezer is phoning me 
i am the target 
and if we don t find the duke 
this  everything  all over 
  it s me  sidney s mate 
  oh  hiya 
  what took you so long to call

ok 
  your champagne  sir 
  i didn t order   
one moment  mr  troop  i want to hear
what this bastard has to say for himself 
i m jimmy s old colleague  eddie temple 
  fuck 
  he told you to locate my daughter 
hunt her down like some lost mongrel 
he said you asked for his help 
mr  troop could find anyone
on the planet in ten minutes flat 
if you d laid a finger on my daughter 
you d be over the edge like that 
you d join that shit  kinky 
who thought he could take my five grand
and fuck me over 
the audacity  how fucking dare you 
i ve known jimmy price for 45 years 
it pays me to keep an eye on him 
do you know what a remora fish is 
  yes 
  oh  you do 
well  jimmy has been swimming
in my slipstream all my fucking life 
i thought he might put some
volatile psychopath on the job 
but i ve checked you out  son 
you re a smart boy 
but you keep very  very bad company 
you know  i host
a charity golf tournament every year 
quite an event in the social calendar 
if i do say so myself 
i like to invite jimmy  some of my friends
find him absurdly hilarious 
drinks are on me  drinks for everyone 
champagne 
fucking good gear and all 
but i ve come unstuck in my attempts
to provide a spectacle for my chums 
jimmy  as usual
on the look out for tidbits 
has met the development minister
of some tin pot republic 
they re trawling the west
for investments 
they have vast natural resources 
quite an investment for the right man 
they ve sent in men from timbuktu
explaining all the details 
profits  shares  long term investments 
short term investments 
they ve even made him an honorary
citizen  even made him one of the tribe 
what we didn t know 
until it all ended in tears 
was that the hard line
communist insurgents
who control the country
outside the mining areas   
bad news about our little venture  jim 
the communists have broken through 
heading for the capital
with little resistance 
what the fuck are you on about 
i got word they were planning a push 
the final coup de grâce  i told jimmy 
  it s all over 
  fuck s sake 
  keep your voice down 
  get my money out quick  now 
as if it was some little kiddie s
piggy bank 
now  i explained that wasn t possible 
we thought we d bought a government 
maybe someone made a better offer 
forget about it 
you win some  you lose some 
how much are we talking 
it s only a cheeky half mill  jim 
  it s much more than that 
  how much 
  13 
  13 what 
  13 million pounds  i m fucked 
  have you gone fucking mad 
13 million pounds 
how could you be so fucking stupid 
you ve been right grafted 
royally turned over 
  like some yank buying london bridge 
  don t talk to me like that 
he accused me of instigating it 
it s no coincidence
i met them at your tournament 
are you fucking demented 
asked me to fly to zurich
to see the minister 
still parked up
in la maison grande  still eating well 
big fat fucker 
on little jimmy s nest egg 
jimmy thought he d keep charlotte
hostage while you went to get his money 
little jimmy was so stupid 
he thought he couldn t lose either way 
i m sorry  what 
if you find charlotte 
he s got his hostage 
if i find you trying to find her 
i do his dirty work 
  i m still not with you 
  your lives are inextricably linked 
i ve found out something
very interesting about jimmy 
something i ve long suspected 
but i ll let jimmy explain 
you follow me 
you ve no doubt suffered jimmy s
  cid was geezers you
was at school with  routine 
the other chap s albert carter 
another twisted bastard
from the old neighborhood 
member of the regional crime squad 
sit back  relax and enjoy 
it ain t like your lot in the old days 
  they ve all gone squeaky 
  tell me about it  jim 
i have to box clever with those
college boys from anti corruption 
  fucking dogs  slags  ten grand 
  it s the going rate  jim 
ten k  hardly seems worth the bother 
well  there s only so much
in those informer funds 
what about gene 
does he suspect anything 
what  about me working
for the old firm  listen  gene   
   is too loyal for his own good 
  i don t fucking believe it 
  you better believe it 
   cause it s fucking happening 
  where did you get this 
mr  troop made it for me 
  it s one of his little hobbies 
  i don t fucking believe it 
don t you want to hear
what jimmy has to say about you 
i ve got one for you 
pluck ed and ready for the pot 
  just give us a name and he s gone 
  in time 
i don t want a bunce 
i want him out of the way 
flash young runt 
one of the new breed  ain t he 
reckons he can just waltz off
into retirement 
i want him away for 12 
if he s got a kilo of class a 
he s looking at double figures 
  i ll put it there myself 
  sounds personal 
he s got a few quid  
he ll come in handy 
i set him up with that slippery accountant
in the first place 
fucking rag head let slip  didn t he 
 you will miss him when he s gone 
mr  price   
is that you  the flash runt
who thinks he s retiring 
you d no idea what jimmy was up to 
how do you think these fuckers
earn a living 
i would ve thought a smart young man
like you would know that already

  mr  troop 
thank you 
this looks like you  son 
smart part of town 
i ll keep an eye open  must dash off 
get home  wash and brush up 
opera tonight  the damnation of faust 
man sells his soul to the devil  all ends

business is being a good middleman

at greenwich park observatory 
  any taxi will drop you off

  i ve been here all day  get clarkie 
  day and fucking night  got it 
hello  young man  thank you
for coming at such short notice 
i hope you didn t feel too summoned 
how are you 
i m in the best of health  mr  temple 
thank you for asking 
  how are you keeping 
  i m very well 
  how was the performance of faust 
  complex 
no wonder it took him 60 years to write it 
how s the family 
what is this  a vicar s tea party 
you do sometimes take
your conversations away with you 
being a clever bastard  are we 
  how do i know you re not wired up 
  well  i m not 
then we ll have to trust each other 
won t we  sit down 
i ve been thinking  after
our chat the other day

no  i ve already got a buyer 
nearly took my hand off 
he s putting the money together now 
i told you  lah  i m still thinking 
it s only been three days 
what s the fucking hurry 
  what s he paying 
  it s confidential 
don t be an idiot 
let me match his offer 
they ve got history 
bad juju 
and  anyway  this serbian maniac s
in hot pursuit 
if i sold them to you  i d have to
disappoint him  and he is definitely not   
i did you a big fucking favor
letting you know about jimmy 
i think you owe me 
2½ million in sterling and euros 
high denomination used notes 
so if i gave you three million 
that would keep everyone happy 
let me state my position 
you can sell these pills
to whoever you like 
that s your privilege 
that s your business 
but i ll tell you 
i ll be very  very unhappy
if you don t sell  em to me 
you understand 
ok  mr  temple  three million  done 
  my buyer s not gonna be happy  though 
  fuck him  he ll get over it 
i m gonna need some help 
someone who can eliminate the problem 
someone who s a bit handy 
whoa  slow down  kidder 
mr  lucky does a drop of freelance work 
i don t need to know 
it s none of my business 
you tell him when 
and he ll come down on the train 
thanks  trev

when do i get my consignment 
monday  no  tuesday  probably 
tuesday  i m paying
over the odds  remember

what  about me working for the old firm 
convinced

amsterdam business with duke 
i really think we should keep
all of this to ourselves  right 
really 
why did you kill larry 
funnily enough 
it was jimmy who persuaded me 
jimmy never liked larry 
look at that wrong  un waving
his money around  it ain t right 
hey  i love you  man 
he saw the future was drugs
and it needed to be run like a business 
crazy larry
was no fucking businessman 
after that business with kilburn jerry   
that s it  son  you do him  bollocks 
   he wanted him gone 
i didn t have any problem doing him

you and jimmy have caused my little
angel charlotte considerable anxiety 
she s off to arizona

i m keeping those pills for myself 
by way of compensation 
i think i m entitled  simple  end of 
the amount of trouble
you ve caused the last few days 
jimmy 
poor little jimmy 
it would be in your interests
if this thing finishes here  now  today 
understand 
it doesn t matter what i do 
this lot are gonna come after you 
they re too long in the tooth
to rampage round the country 
looking for revenge  look at  em 
bunch of under endowed 
ageing fuck pigs 
are you enjoying this 
no  on the contrary 
take it as a compliment 
you re a bright young man 
this monkey business is in your blood 
under your skin 
you re not getting out  you re just
getting in  i ve every faith in you 
one day  it will be you sitting here telling
some young turk the facts of life 
and they are  mr  temple 
you re born  you take shit 
get out in the world  you take more shit 
climb a little higher  you take less shit 
until one day  you re up
in the rarefied atmosphere 
and you ve forgotten what shit
even looks like 
welcome to the layer cake  son 
this thing ends here  tonight 
you understand 
drug money s easy money  not grief 
the odds  as you can see 
are against you 
goodnight 
if you re gonna hang around in this game 
that s where you ve got to be 
in your bonded warehouse with
the ex soldiers doing the dirty work 
while you deliver the suspect lecture
to baffle your opponents
and cover your tracks 
the art of good business
is being a good middleman 
putting people together  i ll always
thank eddie for telling me that 
it s all about honor and respect 
this is the end  mr  duke  as i told you 
do you know what 
i fucking enjoyed that  brother 
just like the old days  shanks 
a nice bit of armed robbery

the money sent  lah

again  i am sorry about lucky 
don t worry about it  kidder 
man was a prick  anyway  later

give me three million for those pills

but suddenly there was a void
where once there was jimmy price 
and after a couple of days  eddie s little
getting in and getting out speech
started to make sense 
  angelo  thank you 
  thank you very much
