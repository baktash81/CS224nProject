i m currently single right now
if you guys are looking for anything 
you can chill at my house
if you guys are interested 
just make sure you keep
your face below my back 
so  like  my face is the only thing 
because  like  if your face
is on my video  it s gonna be ruined 
i m just waiting on the machine 
stop laughing at me  okay 
stop laughing at me 
  he s so blue 
  oh  my god 
this stuff actually works 
i was not expecting that 
that    it works 
  it works  let s get outta here 
  phew 
nobody s ever stood up for me
like that before 
you stood up for yourself 
you know  we just added a little color 
  aww 
  thank you 
of course 
aww 
you guys are the best 
this town is so much more fun
with you in it  nancy 
even if that means
we get in a lot more trouble 
oh  come on  just a little trouble 
your daughter assaulted my son 
that s more than enough for me to sue 
go right ahead 
all my daughter did was defend
a young girl your son cyberbullied 
my son did no such thing 
how about we look at the video
that derek posted
from your ip address 
  this is ridiculous 
  guys  let s all calm down a minute 
under state penal code 848 9 
cyberbullying is a crime
punishable by up to five years in prison
and  1 000 in fines 
and that s just for you  jeff 
this is not over  counselor 
i promise that 
are you sure jeff barnes
is the type of person
you want to have as an enemy 
i think i can handle him 
i m sorry about all this 
i ll make sure nancy
pays for the damages 
that s not gonna be enough  though 
this is not her first offense 
and she involved two other girls 
i can t just turn a blind eye 
she has to face
the consequences this time 
what did you have in mind 
eight hours a day 
okay  for the next two months 
basically my whole summer
just went sideways 
i m surprised that s all
the community service you got 
you committed several felonies 
hey  they re only felonies if you re 18 
oh  excellent point  counselor 
and  since you re nowhere near 18 
you are hereby grounded 
i stood up to a bully 
i mean  why should i get punished
for that 
i m proud of you 
but the way you did it isn t right 
you stooped to his level 
you pulled a prank that caused
thousands of dollars worth of damage 
they may have to re tile
the entire shower 
but worst of all 
you involved other girls 
i mean  that dye wears off 
and delivering justice isn t a prank 
it s my duty 
so  is it like last week 
it was your duty to burn
the word  assassin 
  into mr  blankenship s lawn 
  okay  no  he was shooting crows  dad 
that s murder 
if you think that driving everybody
in town crazy
is gonna sabotage things so bad for us
we have to move back to chicago 
you re wrong 
  we had a deal 
  we never made a deal 
you know  a deal is when two people
come to an agreement 
you made the decision 
i mean  you never gave me
a real choice 
i wanted to stay in chicago
with all my friends 
i never wanted to move here 
i couldn t stay there and you know that 
knowing everything about the city
reminded me of your mom 
yeah  well  maybe   
maybe i don t wanna forget her 
thank you very much 
vote for the train 
let s bring some new blood
to this town 
a little culture 
maybe a chipotle  huh 
you get a burrito 
you get a burrito 
you get a burrito 
where s my burrito 
vote for the train 
and you ll get one 
there she is 
straight from the hoosegow 
i got your skateboard there  sweetheart 
okay 
  listen  nancy 
  give her some space  cars 
support your local business 
vote for the train 
here  have a slice 
maybe you ll come to your senses
and vote for the train  too 
really  not the time 
train won t make anyone wanna visit
this delightful dump anyway 
hey  river heights isn t a dump 
well  it will be if this train
comes through here 
listen  i m fighting
for what makes this town special 
the charm of it  the community 
i mean  do you have any idea
how many historical homes
will be knocked to the ground 
oh  my darling brother 
the train will finally bring us
into the correct century 
grandpa here wants to keep us
in the stone ages 
and look  nancy thinks you re mental
if you find this place charming 
hello  hannah  i m right here 
this town needs something fresh
to shake things up  you know 
give it a little bad element 
  an edge  right 
  you see what she s doing 
see  your aunt
didn t make it in new york 
and now she thinks
she can bring all that
and her stand up career here  too 
hey  i opened for amy schumer  you know 
oh 
it was a door  but still  see 
  that was good  you laughed  right 
  that was all right  yeah 
i could be a big fish in a smaller pond 
fill seats at open mic night 
  hey 
  how you doing  nate 
just because more people
come to see your stand up routine 
doesn t mean the jokes
will actually be funny 
oh 
wow  dad  i didn t know
you had it in you 
sure  take my pie and my dreams 
and besides  jailbird 
i thought you were on my side 
whoa  this is between you two  not me 
okay  i hate to break up
a good family feud 
but it s time we go show people
like your misguided sister here
  how wrong they are 
  mmm hmm 
i m charging you for that pie  nate 
hey  i m just doing my part
to keep my favorite family together 
you guys are all i ve got 
plus  your dad here is the best lawyer
this town s ever seen 
ew  god  get a room 
hey  listen  before your dad got here 
this train was a sure thing 
now  not 
that s how persuasive this guy is 
yeah  yeah  all right  let s go 
all right  here you go 
all right  my brother
from another mother 
let s go rock this town hall meeting 
all right  i d tell you
to break a leg  but   
  but you d actually mean it 
  yeah  exactly 
hey  listen 
i know your dad s
a big pain in the butt 
but he does respect you 
yeah  if he respected me 
i wouldn t be here 
come here  sit with me 
there are no words
for what happened to you 
i can t even begin to know
how you must feel 
losing your mom 
but  think about your dad 
i mean  he lost the love of his life 
living in chicago was killing him 
he was turning into the living dead 
and he didn t want to be that for you 
i never really thought of it that way 
and this place isn t half as bad
as you think it is 
oh   
it kinda totally is 
but  you know 
present company excluded  of course 
having you here is so cool 
the house is alive again 
and i know this place is square
and a little backwards 
but it s nothing us cool girls
can t do something about 
i wish i were half as brave as you 
you re as persuasive as your dad 
and as righteous as your mom was 
those are superpowers  you know 
if you use them for good 
imagine who you could be 
oh  i thought i did 
yeah  i m just tired of everyone
looking at me  you know 
ah  they re all gonna be working
for you someday  don t worry about it 
hey  hey 
back in the car 
back in the car 
what is your problem 
your daddy better get with the times
and let that train come to town 
a lot of powerful people
stand to lose a lot of money
if your daddy has his way 
and i promise you 
they will not let that happen 
let go of me 
now  i m not a violent man 
but i will hurt people if i have to 
i m calling the cops 
cops care about delinquents 
do me a favor 
tell your daddy that willie wharton
said to get on board
or get out of the way 
he tried to run you down 
i m gonna kill this guy 
wait  wait  wait 
where are you going 
you don t even know  do you 
you re worse than nancy 
yeah  well  still right here 
that s just what we need
is two drews arrested on the same day 
hey  maybe we could have
matching handcuffs 
listen  i ve heard of this guy  wharton 
he s trouble 
got fired from the factory 
gets fired from jobs all the time 
  you know tammy drucker 
  uh huh 
he used to date her

this is like the most exciting thing
that s happened since we moved here 
he s not getting away with what he did 
i promise you that

it was mom s favorite 
thought it was a nice touch 
oh

you wouldn t have gone to the cops 
helen  just a minute

  i love your vest 
  thank you 
trust me  we don t want her help 
she s the one who made
that horrible video of derek
and she thinks she can do
whatever she wants

um   
yeah 
i think you and i
are gonna get along just fine 
come here  you 
uh  nancy 
where do you think you re going 
oh  i m taking my 15 
what 15 
the legend dates back to 1885 
when the colfax brothers 
who built twin elms 
malcolm and schuyler 
had a falling out over a woman 
millicent andrews 
malcolm had proposed to her 
she wasn t too jazzed up about being 
you know  married
to the number one pig farmer in town 
plus  she was hopelessly
in love with his brother  schuyler 
oh  boy 
legend has it 
malcolm killed them both
in a fit of jealousy 
buried them in the walls 
then  he offed himself 
did they ever find the bodies 
no 
but when i listen very carefully 
i think i can hear them crying 
you ve gotta be kidding me 
i wouid never kid about a thing
like the colfax ghosts 
stop pretending like you care
about any of this 
well  i don t have to pretend 
she had me at
 people buried in the walls  
you just want to get outta
community service 
which you deserve 
okay  first of all  helen 
i can t get outta community service 
i already tried 
and  second of all  aren t you curious
whether or not the colfax ghosts
are back for revenge 
oh  my 
what 
you two remind me
of when i was young 
but we had better hair
back in those days 
my best friend and i  rosie 
we despised each other 
we even fought once
over the same boy   
chad  peter   
i don t know 
there were so many of  em 
we both dated him 
then he jilted both of us 
we became best friends 
sadly  rosie moved to miami 
she loves a man in a speedo 
it just goes to show you
that sometimes a girl
can find her best friend
in her worst enemy 
huh 
huh 
  yeah  no   
  oh  no  sorry 
hard pass 
hi 
perfect timing  i made dinner 
  what did you do now 
  nothing 
i mean 
today has been incident free 
it s kind of hard to get in trouble
when you re working
on a chain gang  so   
yeah 
  besides that    look 
  mmm  mmm hmm 
  get right in it  yeah 
  okay 
  sit right here  don t trip 
  all right

i m getting ready to go
outta town this weekend 
and    wait  what

positive ways to express myself  right 
then what could be
more positive than helping
a sweet old lady
and witch grandniece 
listen  nancy 
i got a lot going on right now  okay 
i gotta schmooze this land owner
and convince him to reject
the train company s offer 
and i can t do that
if i m worried about you 
well  think of it
as taking me in protective custody 
of an octogenarian 
okay  that old bird can
kick some serious butt if she has to 
okay  but    but 
you re still grounded 
and remember our agreement 
yes  of course

you re too young to know who that is 
of course i know who that is 
oh  i swear that boy
had hips made of butter

photographic evidence to prove it 
i know  which is more than i have to say
about my burlesque career

when do the undead show up 
sometimes it s weird sounds 
music i didn t turn on   
then suddenly 
the lights start flickering crazily 
and then   
things just stop making sense 
don t make sense how 
unfortunately  one cannot be told
what happens at twin elms 
you have to experience it yourself 
you mean  like  the matrix 
i knew you d get the reference 
what  what  honey 
oh  my god  oh  my god 
what  darling  helen  what is it 
what  what  what 
there was in   
in the window 
it was a face  out the window

it was like a warthog or something 
the pig farmer 
  have you seen him before 
  never in the fiesh 
ew  i hate that word 
wait  that thing
might still be out there 
hope so 
oh  my gosh

god  son of a   
hey  nancy 
flora got you picking up trash
here at twin elms  too 
deputy patrick 
you scared the bejesus out of me 
what are you doing out here 
i didn t like the way
sheriff talked to flora yesterday 
so i figured i d come up here
and check the place out myself 
that s awfully nice of you 
and a little random 
not really 
i ve been coming out to twin elms
since i was a kid 
flora actually used to pay me
to mow her lawns in the summer 
before she turned it purple and pink 
yeah 
oh  you haven t happened to see   
a pig man running around  did you 
what 
helen thought she saw
a pigmonger esque thing 
oh  so  you saw the colfax ghost 
you know him 
everybody in river heights
knows the story 
but no one s actually
ever seen him in the flesh 
please  please don t say that word 
fair enough 
you think jeffrey barnes
had something to do with it 
you recognized his car 
i went to school with
derek s older brothers 
spoiled bunch  all of  em 
are you linking them with the ghost 
okay  well  i wanna walk
the property once more before i leave 
and call me if anything else happens 
and tell flora i ll drop in on her
to make sure everything s okay 
thanks  deputy 
maybe you re not as big a tool
as i thought you were 
why  thank you  nancy 
maybe you re not as much of
a pain in the butt i thought you were 
much obliged 
oh  you  uh  might have an easier time
getting around with a little more light 
  here

and raise you another 10 
okay  nancy  if you re such a genius 
then why would derek scare me
and my aunt just to get back at you 
you tell me  rich people are psychos 
i thought your dad
was a lawyer  and i m out 
not that kind of lawyer 
i mean  half of his clients
don t have enough money to pay him 
i forgot your dad s such a saint 
and your mother  nancy 
my mom was a civil rights advocate 
she badgered politicians to
open their eyes and help the little guy 
did she prank them 
she may have had
a more subtle approach than i do 
look  there s more than
one black mercedes in river heights 
not with the same
license plate  there isn t 
make up your mind 
earlier  you said you didn t
see the license plate clearly 
derek did not do this 
and when you find out that i am right 
you will owe me a major apology 
if i find out you re right 
i ll vote you for prom queen 
  i m already prom queen

gonna bet itself  let s go 
it s just you and me  flora

is it just me or are
the light bulbs floating

we may have had a ghost sighting 
i wanna tell you all about it 
but flora s just about to
serve us some breakfast  so   
well  that sounds exciting 
i want to hear all about it 
yeah  yeah  i ll give you
the blow by blow when i see ya 
thanks  dad 
okay  love ya 
love you more 
here  dear 
this ought to help
fight off those dragons 
so  what happened exactly 
you saved us from the ghost 
well  all i remember
is screaming like a baby
before everything went black 
and here i thought my cheese
was finally sliding off the cracker 
now that i know the haunting is real 
i kinda wish i were senile 
you guys don t think that last night
was actually supernatural  do you 
well  how else would you explain it 
i mean  that thing dragged me
around the house at nascar speeds 
and then it disappeared
and then it reappeared
in another part of the house 
what about the floating light bulbs 
no  there s gotta be an explanation 
like   
well  so what do we know 
one  we know a black mercedes
was lurking around twin elms 
  nancy  i told you   
  i know  i know 
i m just stating the facts  okay 
i ll give you a chance
to prove me wrong 
two  we know somebody came
in here and scared us half to death 
and three  we know
it felt insanely real 
were all the doors and windows
locked last night 
oh  yes 
i double check them every night 
are you sure 
maybe    i mean  the   
this is an old house 
maybe the locks don t work so well 
i had the locks redone
just last year 
wait  did you guys   
did you guys notice these footprints 
i thought you did that last night
when you were running around
in the pink grass 
no  no  i wipe my feet 
i m very well trained 
as if this house isn t messy enough 
oh  yes  somewhere in here 
there must be a   
i can t believe it 
well  you don t see that every day 
mean girls first 
i m just kidding 
  stay here  auntie 
  oh 
you don t have to tell me twice 
this must have been some kind
of servants  quarters back in the day 
hey  hey  hey  hey 
oh 
more pink footprints 
ah  yes  a dark  creepy tunnel 
i told you this was gonna be awesome 
huh 
now we know how they got in 
mmm 
oh  so  that s how they
attacked me with the drawers 
well  we re gonna have
to break it to flora
there s no skeletons in these walls 
oh  right 
hey  nancy  come take a look at this 
oh  this must be
how they control the lights 
but i wonder what this controls 
the ghost must have an accomplice 
okay 
but  why did it feel so real 
if people expect a ghost 
they ll see a ghost 
i think something more
than suggestion is at work here 
well  it could have been
sound waves or carbon monoxide 
no  if it was carbon monoxide 
you d be a ghost  too 
but it could have been
some type of drug 
could someone have spiked your food 
not a chance 
i bought that food yesterday 
no one but the three of us
touched it before dinner 
well  thanks for the help 
  i ll let you know what we find out 
  bye 
later 
what about visitors 
i mean  this place
needs a lot of upkeep 
maybe the guys who painted
your grass or a plumber 
or a carpenter 
good idea  i ll make a list 
wow  that s a lot of people 
mmm hmm 
i included some of my gentlemen callers 
oh  auntie 
what  too many 
never 
thank you 
hello  my name s nancy drew 
i understand you recently did
some work at twin elms 
hi  this is helen corning 
my aunt hired you to
rebuild her gazebo 
you replaced the plumbing 
you did the plaster work 
you replaced the windows 
oh  oops  sorry 
i didn t mean to call you 
really 
are you sure about that 
no  that s great 
yes  yes  thank you 
the air conditioner 
hmm   
you said the repairman
came over two weeks ago 
but the company had no record
of sending anyone 
wait  what is this thing 
there s a hose connected to the ac 
i don t know 
but it was taped to the pole 
what is that 
we should take that
to the police 
yeah  well 
let me connect the dots first 
we have to get this to the chem lab 
you know  isolate the chemicals 
find out where it came from 
and you just so happen to know
a chemist that can help us with that 
no  but i know someone who can 
bess and george 
oh  god  oh  man 
i m late for community service 
chemicals 
identification is no problem 
i got chromatography papers
in the lab at school
and this sick new chem app
on my phone  so  it s okay 
  okay 
  drew 
you took advantage
of deputy patrick yesterday 
but you re not taking advantage of me 
well  hey  i can talk
and pick up trash at the same time 
not on my watch 
if you don t get back to work 
i m gonna add two more weeks
to your sentence 
oh  come on  why stop at two 
  nancy 
  we can make it four  if you want 
here 
so you don t end up
with a life sentence 
this should help 
get out of my sight  drew 
you re free to go 
what just happened 
what does it look like 
i mean  i got nancy pardoned 
one of the lesser known advantages
of being from the oldest family
in river heights 
don t you mean  richest  
don t you mean   thank you  
oh 
you guys coming or what 
come on 
i m gonna   
hey  you behaving 
of course  how s your trip 
well  i m leaving now 
i ll text you when i get there 
it ll be a couple of hours 
  okay  love ya 
  love you more 
am i the only one not cool
with helen being here 
her great aunt is the one in trouble 
so  what 
you make nice with the nerdy chicks
until you get what you want 
hey  you re the ones
who attacked my boyfriend 
after he harassed bess online 
hey  guys 
this isn t about our problem 
it s about flora 
so  let s just isolate
whatever s in this tank 
and we can talk later  okay 
fine 
so    how do we get in 
well  i figured you know
how to pick a lock 
oh  so  i get in
a little trouble with the fuzz
and now i m public enemy number one 
  no  i just thought that   
  seriously  nance 
you gonna pick the lock or what 
well  yeah  totally 
don t worry about it 
sorry  this    this takes all night 
you can t even go a night
without talking to your bae 
okay  you guys are just jealous
because you don t have anyone 
oh  you mean  no one to hide behind 
okay 
who s still hungry  i know i am 
maybe now s a good time
to break out that cheesecake 
okay 
good idea 
come on  guys  take a bite 
yeah  this is seriously
god s cheesecake 
oh  blueberry 
that remind you of anyone  helen 
we re not gonna eat traitor cake 
technically  helen s not a traitor 
she s just our enemy 
probably shouldn t eat any anyways 
my skin is a mess 
well  if you don t wanna eat cheesecake 
that s fine  don t eat it 
but you really shouldn t worry
about sweets giving you pimples  bess 
that s the best thing
about being so smart 
you don t have to look pretty 
you won t be going out  anyways 
  you re freaking dead 
  let s go for it 
whoa  guys  stop 
i can sit here
and pretend to be polite 
but it doesn t change the fact that
she s the girlfriend of some guy
that thinks it s okay
to humiliate another human being 
you know exactiy what he did 
and you did nothing to stop it 
what was i supposed to do 
i don t know  you could ve
unfollowed him on instagram 
threatened to break up with him 
expressed even
the slightest shred of disapproval 
that s so easy for you to say 
you have nothing to lose 
maybe  but at least
i still have my soul 
  george  come on   
  nancy  are you that blind 
what  just because you found a new
friend that s more popular than we are 
well  is that really
what you think of me 
i don t know what
to think anymore  nance 
but i do know that as soon
as all of this is over 
she s gonna go right back to
laughing at all of us behind our backs 
you don t know what it s like to be me 
people are constantly
expecting things out of me 
like how i look 
and who i can hang out with 
and who i don t hang out with and   
oh  blah  blah  blah 
 don t hate me because
i m rich and i m pretty  
  i didn t say that 
  then what did you say 
 cause i sure didn t hear
a  sorry  anywhere in there 
i don t know  but i am sorry 
it s ready 
look  helen 
i appreciate you  you know 
getting me outta community service 
i get it  i should go home 
and i ll iet you know what we find out 
thank you 
good riddance 
come on  you guys 
it s over 
does anyone smell butterscotch
pudding  like  on a burning tire 
i was gonna say  uh   
bug spray souffie 
that s eggnog on fire 
it is the same chemical
found in all of those things 
myristicin 
myristi what  what is that 
it s a psychoactive compound
isolated from nutmeg 
so  somebody made us
see ghosts with nutmeg 
yeah  you know 
it s a little known fact 
but if it s consumed
in high enough concentrations 
it can cause
all types of physical reactions 
like nausea or hallucinations 
and then you wake up
with a really nasty hangover 
you said the hose was
connected to the vent 
so someone had a way of releasing
the chemical when the ac was on 
didn t know you knew so much
about hallucinogenic drugs 
chemistry s awesome 
but it says that
you d need a lot of nutmeg
before you could get any effect 
well  the concentration in that canister
was 50 times
more powerful and aerosolized 
so it hit your brains instantly 
so  somebody must be
buying a lot of nutmeg 
can you guys track
that down in the morning 
uh oh 
it is morning 
i better go over to derek s house
and try to get him to confess 
i m taking the evidence 
is this safe to carry 
yeah  just don t drop it 
i said don t  okay  just don t   
yeah  just don t drop it 
it s not funny 
stop messing with her 
not funny 
it can kill people 
call dad 
you ve reached carson drew 
please leave a message 
that s weird 
hey  dad  it s me 
i didn t get a text from you  call me 
busted 
well  well 
now what do we have here 
don t you think you re
overreacting just a little 
  i caught you breaking into their house 
  it wasn t the house 
it was the garage 
and i was only trying to see
if the car had any evidence
to connect it with
the haunting of twin elms 
which  by the way  it does 
oh  yeah  uh   
pink flamingo paint 
damning evidence  if i ever saw any 
yeah  actually  it is damning evidence 
cheese and rice  nancy  again 
handcuffs  really 
don t worry  hannah 
i ve started thinking nickel s my color 
your niece here was caught
breaking into the barnes household 
  is that true 
  depends on how you mean  true  
nancy  i explicitly said   don t go
into the garage till i get there  
wait  you knew about this 
yeah  i told her about it 
uh  yeah  after deputy patrick
checked out twin elms the other night 
he suggested we go to  uh   
uh    go investigate
the barnes  mercedes 
i didn t want nancy
to get in trouble again 
so i told her i d go
over there with her 
must have gotten our signals crossed 
i thought deputy patrick
left me hanging 
so i decided to take a look myself 
with a lock pick set 
it s perfectly legal to own lock picks 
up until the point where
you stick them in someone else s lock 
look  i can vouch for nancy 
sorry  good luck with that 
if you let her go 
i ll make sure she gets home
without any more trouble 
what just happened in there 
wasn t gonna let my boss
arrest the bravest kid in town
twice in one week 
no one s ever stood up
to the barnes family before 
because no one s ever been that dumb 
where were you last night 
i told you  i stayed at bess  
really  then why did bess  mom
think that she was staying with us 
 cause     cause bess 
george  helen and i
broke into the high school
and used the chem lab
to isolate a hallucinogenic drug
that s making flora see ghosts 
but we left everything
the way we found it   
that s not exactly the point 
nancy  you are out of control 
you can t just do whatever you want
and expect to get away with it 
look    i made some calls 
barnes family checked in to the
pike s resort in aspen four days ago 
haven t left since 
so  helen was right  but   
  who was driving that car to twin elms 
  i don t know 
i m still trying to figure that out 
the police are doing their job 
but next time you think about
pulling a b e 
try giving me a call first 
there s some people
in this town who actually care 
okay  this time you are really grounded 
no fake sleepovers
or haunted houses or   
especially investigations 
and i m confiscating your long board 
has dad called you 
no  but we don t usually argue
until after lunch 
why  you mean
he hasn t called you 
  no 
  since when 
hey  nance  what up 
my dad hasn t texted
or returned a call
from me or hannah in 15 hours 
you know
how weird that is  nate 
we have a rule 
last thing at night
and first thing in the morning 
you know  no exceptions 
yeah  i haven t
heard from him either 
well  maybe there s
no cell service at the campsite 
campsite  i   
i thought you said he   
i thought he was at a hotel 
no  no 
this dude that
your dad s meeting  owen michaelson 
will only close the deal
if you go camping with him 
like real camping 
like backpacks and canteens 
the cell service
is probably terrible there 
but that s not like him 
i mean  ever since mom died
he s been even more anal
about calling me than i am 
yeah  i know 
i m sorry  hon 
i didn t realize he hadn t told you 
i got caught up
in all this train paperwork
and didn t think to check on you 
i m falling down
on my godfather duties 
if he calls  i will make sure
that you talk to him 
  okay  nate  thanks 
  sure thing 
well  who d have thunk 
carson camping  huh  that s a relief 
no phone number 
  hey 
  we found the spice company 
bess and i
are suiting up to go con our way
into their records room right now 
they ll never know
what hit them 
you sound weird 
my dad hasn t called
in 18 hours  i mean   
something s off
and i can t put my finger on it 
your gut
is usually right  drew 
when in doubt  listen to it 
yeah  i ll keep that in mind 
holy cow  you scared   
hey  hey  whoa  whoa  whoa 
are you okay  what happened 
yeah 
i know i m the last person
you wanna see right now 
but i broke up with derek 
wow  i didn t know you had it in you 
but what did he do 
nothing  it was all me 
okay  sorry 
can we talk about this in the car 
  huh  yeah 
  my aunt s car  come on 
can you drive 
technically   
you know  george is right about me 
i mean  what i said about bess
was horrible 
who would say that
about another person 
you ve got a point 
but the thing is
i don t even know why i said it 
it just came
out of my mouth like   
i guess some part of me
was still trying to defend derek 
i really like bess 
in a different world  we d be friends 
you skate a lot better than you drive 
well  no one drives in chicago 
look  just   
just do what you think
is right  you know 
don t do what other peopie
expect you to do 
that s so freakin  terrifying 
and you have no idea 
it s just so easy for you
and george and bess 
because you re just so good at things 
important things  that matter 
and you re funny and you re smart 
what do i have
other than my hair and derek 
well  you actually
don t have derek anymore 
your hair s amazing 
you know  i m supposed to be
the hero in my own story 
but i m the villain 
i mean  i ve never
had to be brave or smart
and definiteiy never had to be nice 
maybe now s your chance 
at least the brave part 
 nice  we can   
work on 
mmm hmm 
and speaking of nice  how   
how good are you at accepting apologies 
apologies  for what 
i was wrong about the barnes  alibi 
i told you  nancy drew 
i m sorry  no 
i should have believed you 
i d grovel at your feet   
but i m having
a little trouble driving 
you have no idea
how good it feels to be right 
and there s one other thing 
i think that whoie vigilante justice
might not be the direction
i wanna go in for my future 
are you apologizing about derek 
i don t know
if i wanna go that far  you know  but   
can i just say that maybe
revenge isn t the answer 
that sort of thing 
thank you  nancy 
yeah  well   
just don t wanna be
that giri  you know 
so  i guess we have no suspect 
i ve got ideas  but   
well  i ve gotta find my dad first 
let s start this car again 
yo  what gives 
i can t do this 
you gotta    you gotta go 
you re the chemistry genius 
anyone asks me a serious question 
the ruse ain t gonna hold 
you ll be fine  i can tell you
everything you need to know 
yeah  i will be fine
because you re gonna go in there
and you re gonna do this 
see  look at you 
i have one
tiny adjustment  though 
oh  oh 
see  you look dangerous 
i feel kinda dangerous 
feel empowered
just standing next to you 
now  go in there 
track down some nutmeg 
okay 
  got it  all right 
  yeah  you got it

dad 
dad  are you here 
hey  who leaves
their cell phone during a business trip 
after i talked to him last night
he never got any of my messages 
i mean  nate said
he was out of cell range 
i mean  this makes no sense 
okay  stay focused 
what are the ciues 
i don t know  i have no idea 
okay  take a deep breath
and do your thing 
you got this 
maybe we got something
better than clues 
i already gave you
the keys to the room 
you are not getting access
to the security feed  too 
i told you
this is a matter of life and death 
 i told you
this is a matter of life and death  
don t mock me 
clearly you care about
customer satisfaction 
not really 
ooh 
somebody put a little more
than cream and sugar in this 
get out of here 
this is nothing but coffee 
then why is it so sticky 
ugh 
well  your boss is not gonna like it
when he finds out
you ve been drinking on the job 
here it is 
what s he doing to my dad 
it looks like
he s just putting him to sleep 
yeah  but how do we know that 
if he wanted to hurt your dad
he would ve used a gun
or a knife or something 
it can t be a robbery 
all he wanted was my dad 
well  at least we know what happened 
we have the evidence 
we can go to the police 
can t see the kidnapper s face 
oh  man 
wait  wait  it looks really familiar 
come on  drew  think

how much is the train company

i ve told you very politeiy    no 
listen to the lady

you sure handle stress pretty well 
he has a teenage daughter 
why would you go to all this trouble

in going through twin elms 
all the other property owners
would fall in line 
nobody would be able to stop the train 
but there s no way
i ll allow the sale to go through  nate 
we know
