for thanksgiving
we dont have it in england
is it is it a big deal
well its a heartwarming
american tradition
yeah it celebrates the time
when the indians shared their food
with the early settlers
and how did we repay them
we slaughter them in thousands
and then ship them off
to the shittiest bits of real estate
im lucy
i went to the closet under the stairs
and my clubs werent there
if youd asked
youd have said no
i never knew princeton
had a golf program

its just my way of unwinding
you know
whack a few balls around
at the end of the day
those lectures can fry your brains

he dropped two courses
is that fashionable
is what fashionable
your haircut or lack of one
androgyny suits you max
these kids are so spoiled
i washed dishes
to put myself through college
youve never washed one since
more stuffing jude
im stuffed enough thanks
you have any idea what your father
pays for those tuition fees

some kind of einstein or something
but it turns out hes just
a working stiff like meself
howd it go

mightve been a bit tricky anyway ive
spent half me life trying to hate him
he walked out on me mum
when i was just a bun in the oven

i mean were so normal
oh yeah
i dont know dinner was quite lively
you know when do that lot start
chucking plates at each other

yeah gets all nasty
max
oh man max what are you doing
you can burn that paper boy
but you still gotta show
daniel couldnt wait to go
he saw it as his patriotic duty
and i went along with it
i was proud of him i guess
apparently he did
something brave
so he wore a medal
when they buried him
you dont have to talk about this
i want to
i cant pretend like it didnt happen
he was my first boyfriend
he was the first person
i ever knew to die

i must be sure from the very start
that you would love me
more than her
if i trust in you
oh please dont run and hide
if i love you too
oh please dont hurt my pride

they slip away
across the universe
pools of sorrow waves of joy

possessing and caressing me
nothings gonna change my world
images of broken light
which dance before me
like a million eyes
they call me on and on
across the universe
thoughts meander like a restless wind
inside a letterbox
they tumble blindly as they
make their way across the universe
strike strike strike

us citizen and you were my son

charges for the riot and stuff
