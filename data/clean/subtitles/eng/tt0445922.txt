is it     is it a big deal 
well  it s a heartwarming
american tradition 
yeah  it celebrates the time   
   when the indians shared their food
with the early settlers 
and how did we repay them 
we slaughter them in thousands   
   and then ship them off
to the shittiest bits of real estate 
i m lucy 
i went to the closet under the stairs
and my clubs weren t there 
  if you d asked   
  you d have said no 
i never knew princeton

you know 
whack a few balls around
at the end of the day 
those lectures can fry your brains 
 lectures   what lectures 
he dropped two courses 
is that fashionable 
is what fashionable 
  your haircut  or lack of one 
  androgyny suits you  max 
these kids are so spoiled

but it turns out he s just
a working stiff like meself 
how d it go 
it was okay 
i mean  he didn t invite me back
for thanksgiving 
might ve been a bit tricky anyway  i ve
spent half me life trying to hate him 
he walked out on me mum

a shadow on the x ray 
  track marks  they won t take a junkie 
  you want him to shoot up 
no  we could just jab his arm
with a needle a few times 
make it a rusty needle 
then it ll get infected 
  that could work 
  yeah  gets all nasty 
  max 
  oh  man  max  what are you doing 
you can burn that paper  boy   
   but you still gotta show 
daniel couldn t wait to go 
he saw it as his patriotic duty 
and i went along with it 
i was proud of him  i guess 
apparently  he did
something brave   
   so he wore a medal
when they buried him 
you don t have to talk about this 
i want to 
i can t pretend like it didn t happen 
he was my first boyfriend 
he was the first person
i ever knew to die 
i d never even been
to a funeral before 
i m so scared for max

he ll bend his way out of this fix 
hope you re right 
i am right 
i love the bugger

than just holding hands
if i give my heart to you
i must be sure from the very start
that you would love me
more than her
if i trust in you
oh  please  don t run and hide
if i love you too
oh  please  don t hurt my pride
like her
 cause i couldn t stand the pain
and i would be sad if our new love
was in vain
so that s the way it is 
yeah  that s the way it is 
yeah  well  speaking as a brother 
i think she could do better

i m a cross dressing homosexual
pacifist with a spot on my lung

you know what really pisses me off 
is i swallowed all those cotton balls   
   and they never even
took an x ray 
  you still have options  man 
  yeah  jail or canada   
   and they both suck 
i mean  i could never come home

the americans are forcing even their
friends into becoming their enemies 
every day the hatred increases   
   in the hearts of the vietnamese
who want us out 
the image of america
will never again   
   be the image of revolution 
freedom and democracy   
   but the image
of violent imperialism 
hey  luce  luce  come on

on the edge of the balcony
he was shot 
we thought a firecracker
had gone on 
most of us were downstairs
on the lower level 
police have issued
an all points bulletin   
   for a well dressed white man
seen running from the scene 
we hold these truths
to be self evident   
   that all men are created equal 
memphis is a confused
and shocked city tonight 
no one can believe
what has happened 
it s been just a little over an hour   
   since dr  martin luther king died
from an assassin s bullet 
dr  king was rushed to st  joseph s
hospital emergency room 
he died from a gunshot wound
in the neck 
i m sick and tired of violence 
i m tired of the war in vietnam 
i look at you all
see the love there that s sleeping
while my guitar gently weeps
i look at the floor
and i see it needs sweeping
still my guitar gently weeps
not now  what is this ridiculous
bullshit  he can t even play guitar 
the sound sucked out there 
how many times    
get out there and tell tony to fix it
or i don t go on tomorrow night 
come on  sadie

yeah 
well  she s probably out
fighting for the cause  you know 
it look like you been
fighting for it too  huh 
i don t have one 
that s the problem 
words are flowing out
like endless rain into a paper cup
they slither while they pass
they slip away
across the universe
pools of sorrow  waves of joy
are drifting through my open mind
possessing and caressing me
nothing s gonna change my world
images of broken light
which dance before me
like a million eyes
they call me on and on
across the universe
thoughts meander like a restless wind
inside a letterbox
they tumble blindly as they
make their way across the universe
strike  strike  strike 
no  no

u s  citizen and you were my son
