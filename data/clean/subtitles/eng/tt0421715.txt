i m on a boat 
i m drifting 
can i do anything for you  mom

oh  sugar

finding it harder to keep my eyes open 
my mouth s full of cotton 
there  there  miss daisy 
you gonna scratch yourself to ribbons 
do you want any more
medication  mother 
doctor said you could have
as much as you want 
no need for anybody to suffer 
a friend told me
that she never had the chance
to say goodbye to her mother 
  i wanted to   
  it s okay 
i wanted to tell you
how much i m gonna miss you so   
mom 
oh  caroline 
are you afraid 
i m curious 
what comes next 
they built the train station in 1918 
my father was there the day it opened 
he said they had
a tuba band playing 
they had the finest clockmaker
in all of the south
to build that glorious clock 
his name was   
mr  gateau 
mr  cake 
he was married to a creole
of evangeline parish
and they had a son 
mr  gateau was  from birth 
absolutely blind 
when their son was old enough 
he joined the army 
and they prayed god would
keep him out of harm s way 
for months 
he did nothing but work on that clock 
one day 
a letter came 
and mr  gateau  done for the night 
went up  alone  to bed 
and their son came home 
they buried him in the family plot 
where he would be with them
when their time came 
mr  cake worked on his clock 
laboring to finish 
it was a morning to remember 
papa said
there were people everywhere 
even teddy roosevelt came 
it s running backwards 
i made it that way
so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war
might stand and come home again 
home to farm 
work 
have children 
to live long  full lives 
perhaps my own son
might come home again 
i m sorry if i ve offended anybody 
i hope you enjoy my clock 
mr  cake was never seen again 
some say he died of a broken heart 
some say he went to sea 
excuse me 
do you mind if i make a call 
somebody s watching my little boy 
sure 
i hope i haven t disappointed you 
you couldn t disappoint me 
well  i know i don t have much
to show for myself 
find my dark suitcase 
there s a diary 
this 
could you read it to me 
is this what you want to do 
i tried to read it
a hundred different times 
mom  it s not exactly   
it s just the sound of your voice  darling 
okay 
it s dated april 4th  1985 
and it says new orleans 
 this is my last will and testament 
 i don t have much to leave 
few possessions  no money  really 
 i will go out of this world the same way
i came in  alone and with nothing 
 all i have is my story 
 and i m writing it now
while i still remember it 
 my name is benjamin 
benjamin button   
and i was born under
unusual circumstances 
the first world war had ended 
and i ve been told it was
an especially good night to be born

his bones indicate severe arthritis 
his skin has lost all elasticity 
and his hands and feet are ossified 
he shows all the deterioration 
the infirmities  not of a newborn 
but of a man well in his 80s
on his way to the grave 
he s dying 
his body is failing him
before his life s begun 
where d he come from 
my sister s child  from lafayette 
she had an unfortunate adventure 
the poor child  he got the worst of it 
come out white 
there are places for unwanted babies
like these  queenie 
no room for another mouth to feed here 
the nolan foundation 
despite their good intentions 
thinks this place is
a large nuisance as it is 
  a baby   
  you said he don t have long 
  a baby   
  you said he don t have long 
queenie  some creatures

there was a silence in the house 
it was a wonderful place to grow up 
i was with people who had shed
all the inconsequences of earlier life 
left wondering about the weather 
the temperature of a bath 
the light at the end of a day 
for everyone that died  someone would
come to take their place 
i ve been married five times

by a neighbor tribe of cannibals

and you ought
to be ashamed of yourself

a leak on the roof 
once i was just crossing
the road to get the mail 
i never forgot her   
     blue eyes   
mom 
did you get that this benjamin loved you
from the first time that he saw you 
not many people experience that 
want me to go on 
he crosses something out 
when that baby came 
things were different 
your mama gone away
and your daddy gonna stay
didn t leave nobody but the baby
babies were born  people died 
a lot of folks been through
that old house 
i ve come to say goodbye 
i m going away 
going 
where 
i haven t figured that out yet 
but i ll send you a postcard
when i get there

hello 
  hi 
  i m moving in today 
welcome  we ve been expecting you 
can you please show her up
to mrs  rousseau s old room 
i m sorry  but we usually
don t allow dogs in the house 
well  she s old as the hills 
she s almost blind 
she won t be a bother much longer 
well  all right 
long as she stays from up underfoot 
right this way  ma am 
as hard as i try 
i can t remember her name 
mrs  lawson  or mrs  hartford 
maybe it was maple 
it s funny how sometimes
the people we remember the least
make the greatest impression on us 
i do remember she wore diamonds 
and she always dressed in fine
clothing  as if she was going out 
although she never did
and nobody ever came to visit her 
she taught me to play the piano 
it s not about how well you play 
it s how you feel
about what you re playing 
try this 
you can t help putting yourself
in the music 
there were many changes 
some you could see 
some you couldn t 
hair had started growing
in all sorts of places 
along with other things 
i felt pretty good  considering 
darling  the pain 
all right  mom  i ll get the nurse 
look at this eye 
this is a major hurricane 
a slow hurricane 
with maximum sustained winds of   
not doing too good 
nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave 
i m gonna ride it out 
there 
that should make things much easier 
have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes 
my father waited four hours for
my brother to get here from boger city

by lightning seven times 
once when i was in the field 
just tending to my cows 
my fourth hand didn t show up

well  you re drunk every night 
  is that a girl 
  close friend 
i want to show her the river 
you re not supposed to go joyriding
with civilians 
i could lose my license 
what are you waiting for 
pulled in for repair a wounded duck 
she s flying now  huh 
ahoy  sailor 
i wish we could go with them 
did you say something  mom 
it s getting really bad 
can you hear me  mom 
time just seeped out of me 
 things were changing quickly   
i don t know how it s possible 
but you seem to have more hair 
what if i told you
that i wasn t getting older 
but i was getting younger
than everybody else 
well  i d feel sorry for you 
to have to see everybody you love
die before you do 
it s an awful responsibility 
i d never thought about life or death
that way before 
benjamin  we re meant
to lose the people we love 
how else would we know
how important they are to us 
and one fall day  a familiar visitor
came knocking on our door 
you want to go with me
to the drugstore 
she taught me how to play the piano 
  amen 
  amen 
and she taught me
what it meant to miss somebody 
let s go 
i had gone to a brothel 
i d had my first drink 
said goodbye to one friend
and buried another 
in 1936  when i was coming to the end
of the 17th year of my life 
i packed my bag  said goodbye 
  bye  benjamin 
  goodbye 
i knew  life being what it was 
i d probably never see them again 
bye  mr  benjamin 
  good luck to you  son 
  thank you 
  i love you  mama 
  i love you  too  baby 
i want you to say your prayers
every night  hear

benjamin 
  where you going 
  to sea 
i ll send you a postcard 
from everywhere 
write me a postcard from everywhere 
can you imagine 
he sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went 
every place he worked 
newfoundland  baffin bay 
glasgow  liverpool  narvik 
he had gone with that captain mike 
captain mike had contracted
for three years
with moran brothers tug and salvage 
the old ship had been refitted with
a diesel engine and a new sea winch 
we went around florida
and up the atlantic seaboard 
we were a crew of seven now 
captain mike and me 
cookie  prentiss mayes
from wilmington  delaware 
the brody twins  rick and vic 
who got along fine at sea
but  for some reason 
once they were on dry land
couldn t stand the sight of each other 
you know  one in every
eight boats never returns 
there was john grimm 
who sure fit his name 
all hands lost at sea 
from belvedere  south dakota 
and pleasant curtis
from asheville  notch 
never said a word to anyone 
except himself 
i wrote him constantly 
i wrote him constantly 
i told him i had been invited to
audition in new york city
for the school of american ballet 
please stay 
thank you  thank you 
you can stay 
but i was relegated to the corps 
another dancing gypsy 
benjamin 
how is it when you showed up
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave 
but now  either i drink a hell
of a lot more than i think i do 
or you sprouted 
what s your secret 
well  captain 
you do drink a lot 
we stayed in a small hotel
with a grand name  the winter palace 
you have no idea
what you re talking about 
the hummingbird
is not just another bird 
its heart rate s 1 200 beats per minute 
its wings beat 80 times a second 
if you was to stop their wings
from beating 
it would be dead
in less than 10 seconds 
this is no ordinary bird 
this is a frickin  miracle 
they slowed down their wings
with moving pictures 
and you know what they saw 
their wingtips are doing that 
you know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for 
infinity 
infinity 
everybody  no matter
what differences they had 
the languages  the color of their skin 
had one thing in common 
they were drunk every single night 
three  please 
could you hold  dear  for us  please 
thank you very much  good evening 
her name was elizabeth abbott 
she was not beautiful 
she was plain as paper 
but she was pretty as any picture to me 
what are you looking at 
if you must know 
we have a longstanding agreement
never to go to bed sober 
  isn t that right  darling 
  whatever you say  darling 
her husband was walter abbott 
he was chief minister of
the british trade mission in murmansk 
and he was a spy 
  darling 
  oh  thank you  my darling 
  key  darling 
  oh  yes 
i broke my heel off one of my shoes 
i m not in the habit of walking about
in my stocking feet 
they were long days there 
and even longer nights 
one particular night 
i was having trouble sleeping 
i m sorry 
i couldn t sleep 
i was gonna make some tea 
would you like some 
oh  no  thank you 
milk  honey 
a bit of honey  please 
i hope you like flies in your honey 
oh  perhaps not 
oh  maybe better to let it steep a little 
steep 
soak 
i don t know  i mean 
there s a proper way of making tea 
well  where i m from 
people just want it to be hot 
well  quite right 
  now  you re a seaman 
  a sailor 
i hope you won t think me impolite 
but i have to ask 
aren t you a little old
to be working on a boat 
there s no age limit 
as long as you can do the work 
and you have trouble sleeping 
thank you 
i didn t think i did 
i usually sleep like a baby 
something s been keeping me up 
my father  in his 80s 
he was so convinced
he was gonna die in his sleep 
he limited himself
to having afternoon naps 
he was so determined
he was gonna cheat death 
  did he 
  did he what 
die in his sleep 
he died sitting in his favorite chair
listening to his favorite program
on the wireless 
he must have known something 
my husband s the british trade minister 
and we ve been here for 14 months 
  good god 
  we were supposed to go to peking
but it never seemed to work out 
have you been in the far east 
no  i ve never been anywhere  really 
i mean  outside of harbors 
and where is it that you re from 
new orleans  louisiana 
i didn t know there was another 
and she told me about all the places
she had been  and what she had seen 
and we talked till just before the dawn 
i m just a lush  myself 
and we went back to our rooms 
to our separate lives 
but every night 
we d meet again in that lobby 
a hotel in the middle of the night
can be a magical place 
a mouse running  and stopping 
a radiator hissing 
a curtain blowing 
there s something peaceful 
even comforting
knowing that the people you love
are asleep in their beds
where nothing can harm them 
elizabeth and i would lose track
of the night
until just before daybreak 
i think i may have given you
the wrong impression 
beg pardon 
well  married women don t customarily
sit around
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels 
i wouldn t know what a married woman
does or doesn t do 
good night 
murmansk 
 i ve met somebody 
and i ve fallen in love   
mom 
that was over 60 years ago 
did you love him  mother 
what does a girl know about love 
well   
  i m not dressed 
  oh  you look splendid  just as you are 
don t waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in murmansk 
 cause they re really
completely ordinary 
but the caviar and the vodka
are sublime and plentiful 
so 
savor it 
and don t eat it all at once 
because that way 
there s nothing left to enjoy 
and now  take a little swallow of vodka
while it s still in your mouth 
you haven t been with many women 
have you 
not on sundays 
and you ve never had caviar before 
have you 
no  ma am 
when i was 19 
i attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the english channel 
really 
but the current that day
was so strong that 
for every stroke i took 
i was pushed back two 
i was in the water for 32 hours 
and when i was two miles from calais 
it started to rain 
that s it  steady on 
when i couldn t go any further 
i stopped 
i just stopped 
and everybody asked me 
would i try again 
for why wouldn t i 
but i never did 
as a matter of fact  i ve never done
anything with my life after that 
your hands are so coarse 
i can feel the wind in your cheek 
i m afraid it s the witching hour 
it was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me 
it s something you never forget 
i think you make me feel younger 
you make me feel years younger  too 
i wish i was 
so many things i d change 
i d undo all my mistakes 
what mistakes 
i kept waiting  you know 
thinking that i d do something
to change my circumstances 
do something 
such an awful waste 
you never get it back 
wasted time 
if we re going to have an affair 
you re never to look at me
during the day 
and we re always to part before sunrise 
and we will never say  i love you   
those are the rules 
  are you cold 
  i m freezing 
oh  you  you re frozen 
what an idiot  i m standing here
in this fur  how thoughtless of me 
she was the first woman
that ever loved me 
you want me to skip some 
no  i m glad he had somebody
to keep him warm 
 i couldn t wait to see her again   
we saw each other every night 
we always used the same room 
but each time seemed new
and different 
come here 
elizabeth 
good night 
until one night 
yesterday  december 7th  1941 
a date which will live in infamy   
it s a meeting  a policy meeting
regarding your future 
possibly beyond 
there s been a change of plan  lads 
as you may or may not know 
the japs bombed
pearl harbor yesterday 
frank d  roosevelt s asked
each of us to do our part 
the chelsea s been commissioned
to serve in the united states navy 
to repair  to salvage  and to rescue 
anybody doesn t want to go to war 
now is the time to say so 
once you set foot on that boat 
you re in the navy  friend 
yeah  i ve been meaning
to talk with you  mike 
my wife s doing poorly 
i d like to maybe see her one more time 
you re free to make your way home
any way you can  mr  mayes 
well  if he s leaving  who s gonna cook 
food poisoning s one of the leading
causes of death at sea 
right after
inadequate safety equipment 
i can cook  captain 
been doing it all my life 
i don t know 
you re a little moody for war  benjamin 
what the hell 
i ll take any man wants to kick the shite
out of the japs and the huns 
that s it  pack your gear 
we re going to war  gentlemen 
she had left a note 
she wrote 
 it was nice to have met you   
and that was it 
it wasn t the war any of us expected 
we would just tow crippled ships 
scraps of metal  really 
if there was a war  we didn t see it 
there was a man assigned to us 
the chief gunner loved the navy 
but most of all  he loved america 
there is no other country in the world 
when you spell america   
his name was dennis smith 
and he was a full blooded cherokee 
his family had been americans
for over 500 years 
these pacifists 
they say they won t fight on conscience 
now  where would be
if everybody decided to act
  according to their conscience 
  keep it down  would you  chief 
hey  i ve been watching you 
you seem trustworthy 
if something happens to me 
could you see that this gets to my wife 
he d given me all of his pay 
hadn t spent a dime of it 
i want my family to know
i was thinking about them 
all hands on deck 
get your asses up here 
you lazy bastards 
the war had finally found us 
all stop 
pleasant  man that light 
a transport carrying 1 300 men
had been split by a torpedo 
we were first to arrive at the scene 
  cut the engines 
  all stop 
we were the only sound 
fellas 
sub 
we sure as hell
