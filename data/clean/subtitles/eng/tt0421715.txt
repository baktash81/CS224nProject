the wind mom
they say the hurricane is coming
im on a boat
im drifting

oh sugar
theres nothing left to do

finding it harder to keep my eyes open
my mouths full of cotton
there there miss daisy
you gonna scratch yourself to ribbons
do you want any more
medication mother
doctor said you could have
as much as you want
no need for anybody to suffer
a friend told me
that she never had the chance
to say goodbye to her mother
i wanted to
its okay
i wanted to tell you
how much im gonna miss you so
mom
oh caroline
are you afraid
im curious
what comes next
they built the train station in 1918
my father was there the day it opened
he said they had
a tuba band playing
they had the finest clockmaker
in all of the south
to build that glorious clock
his name was
mr gateau
mr cake
he was married to a creole
of evangeline parish
and they had a son
mr gateau was from birth
absolutely blind
when their son was old enough
he joined the army
and they prayed god would
keep him out of harms way
for months
he did nothing but work on that clock
one day
a letter came
and mr gateau done for the night
went up alone to bed
and their son came home
they buried him in the family plot
where he would be with them
when their time came
mr cake worked on his clock
laboring to finish
it was a morning to remember
papa said
there were people everywhere
even teddy roosevelt came
its running backwards
i made it that way
so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war
might stand and come home again
home to farm
work
have children
to live long full lives
perhaps my own son
might come home again
im sorry if ive offended anybody
i hope you enjoy my clock
mr cake was never seen again
some say he died of a broken heart
some say he went to sea
excuse me
do you mind if i make a call
somebodys watching my little boy

i hope i havent disappointed you
you couldnt disappoint me

right this way maam
as hard as i try
i cant remember her name
mrs lawson or mrs hartford

the people we remember the least
make the greatest impression on us
i do remember she wore diamonds
and she always dressed in fine
clothing as if she was going out
although she never did
and nobody ever came to visit her
she taught me to play the piano
its not about how well you play
its how you feel
about what youre playing

some you couldnt
hair had started growing
in all sorts of places
along with other things
i felt pretty good considering
darling the pain
all right mom ill get the nurse
look at this eye

a slow hurricane
with maximum sustained winds of
not doing too good
nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave
im gonna ride it out

that should make things much easier
have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes

captain mike and me
cookie prentiss mayes
from wilmington delaware
the brody twins rick and vic
who got along fine at sea
but for some reason
once they were on dry land

you know one in every
eight boats never returns
there was john grimm
who sure fit his name
all hands lost at sea
from belvedere south dakota
and pleasant curtis

i wrote him constantly
i wrote him constantly
i told him i had been invited to
audition in new york city
for the school of american ballet

another dancing gypsy
benjamin
how is it when you showed up
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave
but now either i drink a hell
of a lot more than i think i do
or you sprouted
whats your secret
well captain
you do drink a lot
we stayed in a small hotel
with a grand name the winter palace
you have no idea
what youre talking about
the hummingbird
is not just another bird
its heart rates 1200 beats per minute
its wings beat 80 times a second
if you was to stop their wings
from beating
it would be dead
in less than 10 seconds
this is no ordinary bird
this is a frickin miracle
they slowed down their wings
with moving pictures
and you know what they saw
their wingtips are doing that
you know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for
infinity
infinity
everybody no matter
what differences they had
the languages the color of their skin
had one thing in common
they were drunk every single night
three please
could you hold dear for us please
thank you very much good evening
her name was elizabeth abbott
she was not beautiful
she was plain as paper
but she was pretty as any picture to me
what are you looking at
if you must know
we have a longstanding agreement
never to go to bed sober
isnt that right darling
whatever you say darling
her husband was walter abbott
he was chief minister of
the british trade mission in murmansk
and he was a spy
darling
oh thank you my darling
key darling
oh yes

im sorry
i couldnt sleep
i was gonna make some tea
would you like some
oh no thank you

i dont know i mean
theres a proper way of making tea
well where im from
people just want it to be hot
well quite right

i didnt think i did
i usually sleep like a baby

my father in his 80s
he was so convinced
he was gonna die in his sleep
he limited himself
to having afternoon naps
he was so determined
he was gonna cheat death
did he
did he what
die in his sleep
he died sitting in his favorite chair
listening to his favorite program
on the wireless
he must have known something
my husbands the british trade minister
and weve been here for 14 months
good god
we were supposed to go to peking
but it never seemed to work out
have you been in the far east
no ive never been anywhere really
i mean outside of harbors
and where is it that youre from
new orleans louisiana
i didnt know there was another
and she told me about all the places
she had been and what she had seen
and we talked till just before the dawn
im just a lush myself
and we went back to our rooms
to our separate lives
but every night
wed meet again in that lobby
a hotel in the middle of the night
can be a magical place
a mouse running and stopping
a radiator hissing
a curtain blowing
theres something peaceful
even comforting
knowing that the people you love
are asleep in their beds
where nothing can harm them
elizabeth and i would lose track
of the night
until just before daybreak
i think i may have given you
the wrong impression
beg pardon
well married women dont customarily
sit around
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels
i wouldnt know what a married woman
does or doesnt do
good night
murmansk
ive met somebody
and ive fallen in love
mom
that was over 60 years ago
did you love him mother
what does a girl know about love
well
im not dressed
oh you look splendid just as you are
dont waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in murmansk
cause theyre really
completely ordinary
but the caviar and the vodka
are sublime and plentiful
so
savor it
and dont eat it all at once
because that way
theres nothing left to enjoy
and now take a little swallow of vodka
while its still in your mouth
you havent been with many women
have you
not on sundays
and youve never had caviar before
have you
no maam
when i was 19
i attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the english channel
really
but the current that day
was so strong that
for every stroke i took
i was pushed back two
i was in the water for 32 hours
and when i was two miles from calais
it started to rain
thats it steady on
when i couldnt go any further
i stopped
i just stopped
and everybody asked me
would i try again
for why wouldnt i
but i never did
as a matter of fact ive never done
anything with my life after that
your hands are so coarse
i can feel the wind in your cheek
im afraid its the witching hour
it was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me
its something you never forget
i think you make me feel younger
you make me feel years younger too
i wish i was
so many things id change
id undo all my mistakes
what mistakes
i kept waiting you know
thinking that id do something
to change my circumstances
do something
such an awful waste
you never get it back
wasted time
if were going to have an affair
youre never to look at me
during the day
and were always to part before sunrise
and we will never say i love you
those are the rules
are you cold
im freezing
oh you youre frozen
what an idiot im standing here
in this fur how thoughtless of me
she was the first woman
that ever loved me
you want me to skip some
no im glad he had somebody
to keep him warm
i couldnt wait to see her again
we saw each other every night
we always used the same room
but each time seemed new
and different
come here
elizabeth
