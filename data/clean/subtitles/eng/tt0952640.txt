you know  dave   
   some people might say
it s kind of weird   
   that a grown man

  you know what s weirder than that 
a grown man bringing
another grown man   
   a big box
with a bunch of chipmunks in it   
   who not only speak english
but can sing   
they do sing 
we ve been practicing all morning 
oh  you ve been practicing 
i never realized  okay  well 
yeah  okay  no 
dave  i m going to pretend   
   that i have a lunch to go to 
i ve got a lunch to go to 
what was that 
nothing  nothing 
just a little stage fright 
i thought my heart
was gonna explode 
we re not performing monkeys 
why do we have to sing
for that guy 
well  how s this 
pretend i need the money
and i hate my job   
   and you re staying at my place 
so you owe me 
we re sorry  dave 
yeah  that helps 
never mind  i m late for work 
can we go with you

you re going home 
can i stand in your lap and steer 
oh  can we at least beep the horn 
never mind 
so sorry about the delay 
it should be a couple more minutes 
but we re building the suspense 
 here he is 
 sorry i m late 
boy  am i jazzed about our
yum able energy bars commercial 
that s good able energy bar
commercial 
right  good able 
okay  here s the pitch 
we open on a group of lethargic kids 
close up on a little girl s face 
she s sad 
our customers don t like to think
of their kids as being sad 
could she be flying a kite 
i like kites 
good 
okay  great  she s flying a kite 
she s running with a kite 
she s running out of steam 
she s tired and lets go of the kite 
oh  no  we see her face  it s sad 
 but not too sad 
 right 
so she pulls out
her good able energy bar  
it s my mom  sorry 
 hi  mom

you know  when i first saw these
numbers  i thought there s just no way   
   but then i looked again 
the   size of theodore s butt   
why don t we come back to that 
anyway  10 years ago  the market share
for healthy food snacks   
   was imperceptible
among 6  to 12 year olds 
  how smart simon thinks he is   
yeah  as opposed to
how smart he actually is 
who s simon 
 i didn t  
 just move it along 
you know what

 hi 
 hello 
 hi  claire 
you re hot 
forgot you guys haven t officially met 
so  dave   
   i m sorry about that night 
i really thought that you  
that i was insane 
i totally understand it 
talking chipmunks 
it s a lot to take in over dinner 
but look at you now  you ve got
the career  promising future  kids 
you re like a family 
don t say   family   in front of dave 
it gives him gas 
 like  clear the room gas 
 does not 
he doesn t want a family 
why don t you guys go and play
or raid the dessert table 
don t take it personally  you guys 
some people don t know a good thing
when they ve got it 
right  dave 
claire 
no offense  big guy 
but you are not good at this 
hey  what do you think of this 
 what is it 
 it s alvin 
that looks nothing like alvin 
well  yeah  it s a prototype 
we ll sell a million of these things 
it s voice activated 
here  say something to it 
hello  ugly little alvin doll
that looks nothing like alvin 
 see  you love it  it s spanish 
 you know what  that s just weird 
come on  dave  dave  dave 
we ve got to expand
the munks  fan base 
i mean  forget about the music 
the music is but a means
to the big money  okay 
i m talking about our own
fur clothing line  cologne 
 i mean  
 they re just kids

and they could make us both
so much money   
    if you just let me work with them 
 i can t hear you  the music s too loud 
don t go against me on this  dave 
i never lose 
has anyone tried
the chocolate meatballs 
i ll probably go into insulin shock 
but it s worth it 
oh  a sweet  sweet 
sweet molasses meat 
hey  alvster  love the song  bro 
 up top 
 what s up  player 
so i see you re enjoying my little spread
that i ve put out for you guys 
what am i talking about 
you probably eat like this all the time 
well  dave says
he doesn t wanna spoil us 
dude  you re a rock star 
you re supposed to be spoiled 
i mean  you should be riding
in limousines and private planes 
and you should be going to parties
like this every night 
really 
because dave says we need our sleep 
look  alvin  this is hard to say
but  i mean  i gotta be upfront about it 
dave s holding you back  you know 
i could be making you 20 large a day 
 is that a lot 
 yes 
another thing   i m not gonna tell you 
i will tell you 
look  behind your back 
dave calls you
