just way down the hall
from each other 
 mumbles 
what am i talking about 
this is bad 
long distance relationships
never work 
this is just the beginning 
imagine the future 
friends separated   
promising each other
they ll remain besties 
but within months 
we ll be awkwardly bumping
into each other at the mall 
hey  george 
hey  do i know you 
harold  
you ll have a weird haircut 
i ll be wearing
a suit for some reason 
and before we know it 
separate classes
will lead to separate lives   
which inevitably
leads to robots 
what  why are there robots
at the mall 
because this is the future 
the future always has robots 
 screams 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
why are the robots
shooting other robots 
aren t they
supposed to be friends 
i don t know

very time consuming 
it took a week 
eww  they like each other 
oh  no  george 
i think it s much worse 
they like like each other 
what are you talking about 
adults don t
like like other adults 
well  you probably haven t
seen it at your home
since your parents are married 
in my studies  like liking
seems to end with marriage 
well  i should probably gel
back to running the school 
you know 
it s not gonna run itself 
 chuckles 
but     sighs 
oh  edith  get your head
out of the clouds

teaching experience 
oh  no  i can t say that i do 
not even  like  babysitting

camp counselor 
never was a camp counselor 
although
i did receive counseling   
for some trauma i experienced
as a child 
i m getting a really good vibe
about you 
now hold on 
let me see that resume 
it says here that you were
a genius inventor 
mad   
genius inventor 
but yes 
and then for
the last few years   
you ve  been in
a very dark place    
and your title was   
 revenge seeker  
 revenge at all costs   
 die  die  
am i reading this right 
yeah  that s basically
what i ve been up to   
so here i am 
applying for a job in
the thriving
public school system   
with all of
its amazing resources 
but honestly 
kids are so understanding 
so innocent 
their smiles brighten my heart
and fill me with   
a joy adjacent feeling 
as long
as they are controlled   
and do not laugh
nor smile nor play nor laugh 
children must never laugh 
well  you seem terrific 
you re hired 
both   what 
excellent 
oh  by the way 
going to need fridays off   
and every other tuesday
through thursday

hope that s not a problem 
okay  bye bye 
oh  this is bad 
we just hired a maniac
for a science teacher 
uh  yeah  we gotta fix this
before krupp finds out 
sounds like a job
for captain underpants 
no  no  no 
you need to stay here 
okay  you re
the principal  remember 
yeah  just sit there
and look angry for no reason 
you got it  grr

 exclaims 
 chalk writing on board 
 chalk clatters 
hiya  class 
i m your cool  new teacher 
not some scary guy
with a secret evil agenda 
anyway  i m just going to dive
right in here 
if there was one thing
about this world
that you could change   
what would it be 
ooh  ooh  peace on earth 
unattainable  anyone else 
pacific ocean into chocolate 
atlantic into nacho cheese 
ifs like we re the same person
and yet so  so different 
i love it 
 both snickering 
but more importantly   
if i had to change one thing
about the world   
it would be to get rid of   
laughter 
get rid of laughter 
what kind of person
wants to do that 
oh  oh  ah  ah  sir  sir 
yes  
i love it 
oh  look at this 
we got a grade a suck up 
good to know  good to know

of an average child

the  thinking about candy 
lopalus 
the  fear of
what s under the bed  lobe 
this is the  only thing
i ll eat is pizza   
 chicken nuggets 
or buttered noodles  lobe 
right here is the
 as soon as

 i want that toy  anterior lobe 
and this   
this is the
hahaguffawchuckleamalus 
this funny little purple part
holds our entire capacity
for laughter 
for years 
i ve tried to shrink it
or cut it out entirely   
but frustratingly 
our survival seems
dependent upon it 
i don t like this  i mean 
i don t really understand it 
but the stuff i am understanding
seems genuinely bad to me 
yeah  same 
um    excuse me  professor p

must teach it   
because that is how good it is 
i don t understand 
i thought  like 
we d be on the same page here 
what page is that 
i m on page 9  here 
it s fantastic 
look  look 
it s about
this evil science teacher   
who looks a lot like you 
by the way 
and he wanted to
rid the world of laughter   
but he couldn t figure out
how to do it 
even worse  i  seemed like
everywhere he went 
people were having fun
and laughing 
it just was infuriating 
but then  he discovered
someone who wasn t 
why is it funny 
captain underpants  
anti humor boy 
and then the professor says 
 very interesting  
that s my voice for him 
wait  wait  wait  gimme that 
that s no anti humor boy 
that s the suck up from class 
very interesting 
 chuckles

impressive use
of fast food analogies 
you giant baby with a cape on 
let s do this 
 growling 
 roaring

gave captain underpants
the boot 
george   foot  foot  ow

george   quiet five  quiet five 
but george and harold s plan
was working out perfectly 
 george vocalizing  so  they
shot themselves to the top
of the turbo toilet 2000 
to keep things dramatic 
they didn t quite make it 
and then   
and then   
and then   
what happened

than mr  krupp ever was 
but  you know  george   
bringing back krupp
permanently   
we ll never be
in the same class again

prepared anything  but   
 clears throat 
i  harold   
hereby declare george
as my best friend 
permanently  forever 
and i  george  accept
the permanent rights   
that harold has given me
to be his best friend forever   
and the constitution
of friends

of america 
land and the united states 
good  okay  yeah

clearly  we have 
chums 
thank you for chronicling

you boys are in big trouble 
 stammering 
i don t know how big yet   
 yells  why does this
keep happening 
where are my clothes

 george sighs 
i don t get it 
why is krupp so angry
and captain underpants so happy 
maybe it s because
captain underpants had us 
you know  he had friends 
we could fix that 
yeah  you know  we could 
so that s how we came
to pull the rarest prank
of all   
the prank   
for good

a date 
 love  edith  
 principal krupp  
oh

 clears throat 
but  if you must know

by the way 
i was tidying up my office   
and i believe
these belong to you   
our comics 
did you just pull that out
of the garbage can 
well  i read them   
and considering
they re completely
implausible  juvenile   
and filled with
the lowest form of wit   
potty humor   
they re actually pretty funny 
see ya later 
 vocalizing 
well  how about that   
 laughing 
that s a good one 
 sighs 
you know  it feels good to do
something nice for mr  krupp 
yeah  you know what  it does 
promise we ll never do it again 
promise 
oh  my 
i ve never been to
such a fancy restaurant before 
 toilet flushing 
well  i had to go all out
