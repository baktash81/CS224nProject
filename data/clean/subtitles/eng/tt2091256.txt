the future always has robots
screams
whoa whoa whoa

a very dark place
and your title was
revenge seeker
revenge at all costs
die die

yeah thats basically
what ive been up to
so here i am
applying for a job in
the thriving
public school system
with all of
its amazing resources
but honestly
kids are so understanding
so innocent
their smiles brighten my heart
and fill me with
a joyadjacent feeling
as long
as they are controlled
and do not laugh
nor smile nor play nor laugh
children must never laugh
well you seem terrific
youre hired
both  what
excellent
oh by the way
going to need fridays off

sounds like a job
for captain underpants
no no no
you need to stay here
okay youre
the principal remember
yeah just sit there
and look angry for no reason

why is my face wet
exclaims
chalk writing on board
chalk clatters
hiya class

not some scary guy
with a secret evil agenda
anyway im just going to dive
right in here
if there was one thing
about this world
that you could change
what would it be
ooh ooh peace on earth
unattainable anyone else
pacific ocean into chocolate
atlantic into nacho cheese
ifs like were the same person
and yet so so different
i love it
both snickering
but more importantly
if i had to change one thing
about the world
it would be to get rid of
laughter
get rid of laughter
what kind of person
wants to do that
oh oh ah ah sir sir
yes
i love it
oh look at this
we got a grade a suckup
good to know good to know
anyway
this is the brain
of an average child
right here is
the thinking about candy
lopalus
the fear of
whats under the bed lobe
this is the only thing
ill eat is pizza
chicken nuggets
or buttered noodles lobe
right here is the
as soon as
someone else has a toy
i want that toy anterior lobe
and this
this is the
hahaguffawchuckleamalus
this funny little purple part
holds our entire capacity
for laughter
for years
ive tried to shrink it
or cut it out entirely
but frustratingly
our survival seems
dependent upon it
i dont like this i mean
i dont really understand it
but the stuff i am understanding
seems genuinely bad to me
yeah same
um excuse me professor p
why are you trying to
get rid of laughter
isnt laughter
the best medicine
medicine is the best medicine
so
yeesh

oh its private
so that means your name is
professor privates
laughing
