and a bouquet of flowers   
    to brighten up the place 
mom 
mom  mom 
what she doesn t know is   
    three days prior 
her mother s fallen off a footstool   
   busted her head open
and broken her neck 
by the time she gets there 
her mother s body   
   is bloated with bacterial gases 
there s fluids leaking from
her eyes  ears  nose  mouth 
you get the picture 
well  death is tragic 
but it s also big business 
some people deal with it spiritually 
others deal with it legally 
but what most people don t know   
   is that when someone dies
in your house   
   it s up to you
to clean up the mess 
well  sure  the city will come
and take the body away 
but what they leave behind   
   is your own
personal little souvenir 
now  most people
don t have the stomach for that 
that s where i come in 
now  cleaning a body is   
   actually a lot like cleaning
any other household spill 
there are three basic steps 
first  get rid of all the bugs 
hiv  herpes  tuberculosis 
adenovirus  hantavirus  e  coli 
now  i assume all those things
are present  so i spray everything   
    with my own personal little cocktail
of antivirals and disinfectants 
and just between you and me 
i also throw in a little listerine 
the original flavor 
it has an enzyme
that liquefies coagulated blood 
you gotta use the original flavor 
not that new blue or orange shit 
well    
tom  that s

i asked a question back at my house
and you never answered me 
what kind of cleaning service
do you run here 
biomedical and biohazardous
abatement and sanitation 
you clean crime scenes 
yeah  but that s only a part
of what we do 
cherie give you our brochure 
i m not sure if you ve read
your paper yet  mr  cutler   
   but my husband is missing 
that s your husband  i m sorry 
the day after my husband
disappears   
   a crime scene cleaner shows up
at my door   
   talking about a job he did
at my house 
what am i supposed to think
about that 
i explained to you why i came by
your house  sorry for the mix up 
if you have information that ll help
police find your husband  go to them 
what makes you think i haven t
done that 
well  if you had  i d be talking
to them and not you 
i m a retired police officer 
mrs  norcut 
in my line of work   
   i m in regular contact
with the police 
if there were anything questionable
about a crime scene   
   i d be the first one to step up 
look  i know what you re
going through is rough 
i lost my wife a few years ago 
 so i understand  
 should i be grieving 
no  no  no  of course not 
then why would you empathize
with me 
well  i m just saying that your concern
is understandable 
you said you mistook my house
for one on ridgecrest lane 
 what kind of work did you do there 
 i m afraid i can t discuss that 
i m afraid i checked  mr  cutler 
there is no ridgecrest lane 
so yes  i d say that my concern
is more than understandable 
look  my husband made his share
of enemies   
   but i have a feeling you re
not one of them 
please  i won t repeat
anything you tell me 
i just need to know for myself 
did you do any work at my house 
look  i would love to be
of more assistance to you 
and i hope the police find
your husband 
now  if there s nothing else 
i have a really full day 
i m glad you re so friendly
with the police 
any time 
 mr  cutler  the police are here 
 thanks

a thousand times and never came in 
it s lovely 
it s private 
so were you followed 
who would be following me 
 you wearing a wire 
 no  are you 
why were you watching me
yesterday 
do you have something to tell me 
ask you 
why haven t you told
the police about me 
i don t trust the police 
look  i know your husband
was talking to the da 
he was gonna testify
against robert vaughn 
so i need to know
who else he was gonna implicate 
did you clean my house 
look  mr  cutler 
this has to be a two way street 
i haven t gone to the police
and i m not about to 
but  please  i need to know
what happened for myself 
i used to come to this church
twice a week 
once for mass  once for confession 
that was a long time ago 
yes 
yeah  i cleaned your house 
 oh  god 
 looked like a legitimate crime scene 
whoever did it had access
to the materials   
   and they knew procedure 
 how did he   
 he was shot 
where  exactly 
living room  on the couch 
who hired you 
that s what i m trying to find out 
mrs  norcut 
 two way street  right 
 yeah 
what was your husband
going to tell the grand jury 
i think it s better if i show you 
this used to be an old fire station 
and now it s a safe haven for kids 
that s a mighty big pair of scissors 
oh  that s robert vaughn 
he did the initial fundraising 
without him  we wouldn t be here 
my office is upstairs 
john wrote everything by hand
so that it could be authenticated 
he called this his
 get out of jail free card  
what is it 
it s an account ledger 
but it s in some kind of code 
look  these numbers
look like dates 
i m assuming these
are dollar amounts 
but this middle column 
i don t know 
they re too short
to be account numbers  right 
 could they be phone numbers 
 no  badge numbers 
are you sure 
yeah  this is a record
of every cop who s on the payroll 
jesus  this thing goes back
at least 1 0 years 
is there any way
we can find names 
if i still had access  which i don t   
   it could take days   
   possibly weeks to match
these badge numbers with names 
plus we don t have any evidence 
everybody in here s a suspect 
all right  a couple of weeks ago   
   vaughn came over
with another man 
it ended up in a shouting match
and i haven t seen vaughn since   
   but after that john became
really paranoid about the book 
he kept talking
about going to the da 
 and who was the other man 
 a detective vargas 
okay 
look  i need you
to write down the names   
   of every cop you talked to
since  including vargas 
okay 
maybe i can get
their badge numbers 
charming neighborhood 
 i been looking for a summer home 
 you got that list for me 
marty pappas  darrin harris 
jim vargas 
what do you need
with all these badges 
i met with the wife 
seems mr  norcut kept records 
every cop that s ever taken a cent
is written in a ledger   
   and listed by badge number 
jesus  tom  what are you   
you know how many guys vaughn
would send if he knew you had that 
 let me worry about that 
 well  take my advice 
 forget you ever saw any ledger 
 not that simple 
yeah  it is  somebody asks 
you say   what ledger  
 i m in the ledger 
 jesus christ  so burn it 
it s your motive  get rid of it 
 it s practically got a bow on it 
 poor woman s husband s dead 
burn the thing that might help her
find the killer

john didn t want kids 
but we almost had one recently 
we lost it 
sorry 
so am l 
what s the worst thing you ve seen 
oh  i wanna know 
the worst thing i ve ever seen 
that would have to be before this job
when i was a cop 
a homicide 
victim was a woman in her 30s 
two gunshot wounds to the chest 
shooter was there to rob the place   
   victim put up a fight
and he shot her 
there was moderate blood pooling
on the floor   
   some spatter on the beds
and walls 
that s the worst thing 
down the hall in another bedroom 
there was a kid 
two paramedics were sitting
with her 
she was clutching a stuffed animal 
a frog 
she found her mother s body
and called 91 1 
tough kid  if you think about it 
six years old and she still had sense
enough to call 91 1 
but those eyes 
those eyes that   
   saw something
no kid should ever have to see 
those eyes looked at me 
looked into me 
through me 
those eyes 
 that s the worst thing i ve ever seen 
 she was your daughter 
did you catch him 
oh  yeah 
yeah  we got him 
license and registration  please 
 ls there a problem  officer 
 your taillight s out 
 so where you headed 
 was i speeding too

i know who you are  tom 
hi

rose  that s not going to happen 
look at me 
i m never going to let anything
like that happen again 
and we are a team 
we re a good team 
we look out for each other 
but we don t dwell on things
we have no control over 
this project 
 i mean  look what it s doing to you 
 there is no stupid report  dad 
 there s no    i don t understand 
 i m starting to forget her 
oh  rose 
look  you can t spend your life
going through this box looking for her 
she s not there  she s gone 
it s just you and me now  okay 
so let s just put this away  all right

 have you lost your mind 
 you don t get it

 hello 
 i m coming to get you 
wait  wait  wait  i m not at the house 
i m at the hospital 
vargas called this morning  he
said he wanted me to identify a body 
the press found out john was gonna
testify  it s on the news  everywhere 
 what hospital

all right  just stay there 
i know a back way in 
 you all right

 what happened to your face 
 nothing 
 sure it s not john s 
 no 
his key was still on the ring
found in his car 
anybody else have one 
sister  neighbor 
no one  john was paranoid 
he didn t want copies lying around 
maybe he had one made
for someone he didn t tell you about 
as in a woman 
that wasn t john s style 
not making keys for them anyway 
look  i don t see
how any of this is helping us 
vaughn didn t need this
to look like an abduction 
if he d known about the ledger  he d
have ransacked your house to find it 
someone with a key wanted you
to come home to a clean house 
arlo 
oh  tom  you scared me 
 this is ann norcut 
 norcut  right 
wait 
does vargas know you re here 
i was hoping we can
get through this without him 
he kind of needs to be here 
but i don t know 
maybe we could do
the paperwork without him 
i don t understand why i have to do
this  they have photos of john 
they didn t tell you  well  the corpse
does not have much of a face 
mrs  norcut  i guess
all we need from you   
   is to identify a couple
of dms and the wedding band 
 dms 
 distinguishing marks 
if i could get you
to sign these  the top portion 
excuse me  is there a restroom 
i feel faint 
yes  i m sorry

where was that conscience of yours

 he made her kill her own baby 
 she lied to you 
you think i can t have
what you have 
she was gonna have our child

just like he buys everybody off 
he tried to buy me off 
 put the piece away 
 remember that night i went there 
he tried to write a check
so i would leave 
a check 
she was gonna have a baby with me 
tommy  with me 
 she was gonna have our child 
 stop waving your gun in my house

most people don t know this 
but when someone dies
in your house and leaves a mess   
   it s up to the family to clean it up 
most people don t have the stomach
for that kind of thing 
that s where my dad comes in 
my dad says
that stains have memories 
they remember their shape 
their color  their smell 
and the really deep ones
return again and again
