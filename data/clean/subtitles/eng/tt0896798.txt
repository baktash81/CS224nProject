and a bouquet of flowers
to brighten up the place
mom
mom mom
what she doesnt know is
three days prior
her mothers fallen off a footstool
busted her head open
and broken her neck
by the time she gets there
her mothers body
is bloated with bacterial gases
theres fluids leaking from
her eyes ears nose mouth
you get the picture
well death is tragic
but its also big business
some people deal with it spiritually
others deal with it legally
but what most people dont know
is that when someone dies
in your house
its up to you
to clean up the mess
well sure the city will come
and take the body away
but what they leave behind
is your own
personal little souvenir
now most people
dont have the stomach for that
thats where i come in
now cleaning a body is
actually a lot like cleaning
any other household spill
there are three basic steps
first get rid of all the bugs
hiv herpes tuberculosis
adenovirus hantavirus e coli
now i assume all those things
are present so i spray everything
with my own personal little cocktail
of antivirals and disinfectants
and just between you and me
i also throw in a little listerine
the original flavor
it has an enzyme
that liquefies coagulated blood
you gotta use the original flavor
not that new blue or orange shit
well

at my house
what am i supposed to think
about that
i explained to you why i came by
your house sorry for the mixup
if you have information thatll help
police find your husband go to them
what makes you think i havent
done that
well if you had id be talking
to them and not you
im a retired police officer
mrs norcut
in my line of work
im in regular contact
with the police
if there were anything questionable
about a crime scene
id be the first one to step up
look i know what youre
going through is rough
i lost my wife a few years ago
so i understand
should i be grieving
no no no of course not
then why would you empathize
with me
well im just saying that your concern
is understandable
you said you mistook my house
for one on ridgecrest lane
what kind of work did you do there
im afraid i cant discuss that
im afraid i checked mr cutler
there is no ridgecrest lane
so yes id say that my concern
is more than understandable
look my husband made his share
of enemies
but i have a feeling youre
not one of them
please i wont repeat
anything you tell me
i just need to know for myself
did you do any work at my house
look i would love to be
of more assistance to you
and i hope the police find
your husband
now if theres nothing else
i have a really full day
im glad youre so friendly
with the police
any time
mr cutler the police are here
thanks

oh what a dump
if i was gonna off myself i think
id go to the four seasons
yeah a lot of people do
im sorry i got a little drunk
last night
i know you wanted to talk

of a struggle

and im not talking ajax
so i hear this
i remember you asking me
about the case last
you following a lead here

i dont know who vaughns
got working there
i call it in to the wrong person

old habit
you still got all the papers right
yeah release forms crimescene
photos everythings at the office
hang on to everything
its your alibi
that just proves i was there
not that i didnt do it
you were just doing a job

but i had opportunity and ability
but not the motive right
we never took a penny
from vaughn
right tom
tom
you want me to help you out youre
gonna have to tell me whats going on
you ever wonder why they
stopped questioning us
about hill getting shanked
in prison
vaughn comes to me he says he can
make the whole inquiry go away

im thinking about rose
and shes already lost a parent
so i do the job

new business so i do another job

jurys gonna see an old soldier
marching to orders

everything norcut knew you think
vaughns gonna let anybody find him
vaughns not running things
but his guys are
this case was closed
before it opened
the whole investigation is a show
you remember how things were
i panicked as she soon as

where did you dig this up
this was years ago
lnternet
lnternet
why did they question you
if he was killed in jail
well you know
sometimes people think the police
can do anything they want
thats not the case
they questioned us
nothing came of it
what was his name
the man who did it
it only says inmate
i just wanna know
i told you a hundred times
daniel hill
he cant hurt us anymore
ive driven by this church
a thousand times and never came in
its lovely
its private
so were you followed
who would be following me
you wearing a wire
no are you
why were you watching me
yesterday
do you have something to tell me
ask you
why havent you told
the police about me
i dont trust the police
look i know your husband
was talking to the da
he was gonna testify
against robert vaughn
so i need to know
who else he was gonna implicate
did you clean my house
look mr cutler
this has to be a twoway street
i havent gone to the police
and im not about to
but please i need to know
what happened for myself
i used to come to this church
twice a week
once for mass once for confession
that was a long time ago
yes
yeah i cleaned your house
oh god
looked like a legitimate crime scene
whoever did it had access
to the materials
and they knew procedure
how did he
he was shot
where exactly
living room on the couch
who hired you
thats what im trying to find out
mrs norcut
twoway street right
yeah
what was your husband
going to tell the grand jury
i think its better if i show you
this used to be an old fire station
and now its a safe haven for kids
thats a mighty big pair of scissors
oh thats robert vaughn
he did the initial fundraising
without him we wouldnt be here
my office is upstairs
john wrote everything by hand
so that it could be authenticated
he called this his
get out of jail free card
what is it
its an account ledger
but its in some kind of code
look these numbers
look like dates
im assuming these
are dollar amounts
but this middle column
i dont know
theyre too short
to be account numbers right
could they be phone numbers
no badge numbers
are you sure
yeah this is a record
of every cop whos on the payroll
jesus this thing goes back
at least 1 0 years
is there any way
we can find names
if i still had access which i dont
it could take days
possibly weeks to match
these badge numbers with names
plus we dont have any evidence
everybody in heres a suspect
all right a couple of weeks ago
vaughn came over
with another man
it ended up in a shouting match
and i havent seen vaughn since
but after that john became
really paranoid about the book
he kept talking
about going to the da
and who was the other man
a detective vargas
okay
look i need you
to write down the names
of every cop you talked to
since including vargas
okay
maybe i can get
their badge numbers
charming neighborhood
i been looking for a summer home
you got that list for me
marty pappas darrin harris
jim vargas
what do you need
with all these badges
i met with the wife
seems mr norcut kept records
every cop thats ever taken a cent
is written in a ledger
and listed by badge number
jesus tom what are you
you know how many guys vaughn
would send if he knew you had that
let me worry about that
well take my advice
forget you ever saw any ledger
not that simple
yeah it is somebody asks
you say what ledger
im in the ledger
jesus christ so burn it
its your motive get rid of it
its practically got a bow on it
poor womans husbands dead
burn the thing that might help her
find the killer

isnt there anymore
you know if you were to ask me
back then
how my life was gonna turn out
i would have said like this
warm house kids running around
magnets on the refrigerator
john didnt want kids
but we almost had one recently
we lost it
sorry
so am l
whats the worst thing youve seen
oh i wanna know
the worst thing ive ever seen
that would have to be before this job
when i was a cop
a homicide
victim was a woman in her 30s
two gunshot wounds to the chest
shooter was there to rob the place
victim put up a fight
and he shot her
there was moderate blood pooling
on the floor
some spatter on the beds
and walls
thats the worst thing
down the hall in another bedroom
there was a kid
two paramedics were sitting
with her
she was clutching a stuffed animal
a frog
she found her mothers body
and called 91 1
tough kid if you think about it
six years old and she still had sense
enough to call 91 1
but those eyes
those eyes that
saw something
no kid should ever have to see
those eyes looked at me
looked into me
through me
those eyes
thats the worst thing ive ever seen
she was your daughter
did you catch him
oh yeah
