i mean  literally 
i see one drop of blood  that is me

due to our uninvited guest 
but i promise you 
by the time i find out who he works for   
you and i will be the best of friends 
to the shop  please 
arthur is in the dining room  sir 
arthur 
galahad 
the others were beginning to wonder if
we were going to have a double toast 
gentlemen  i am thankful to say
that it s been 17 years   
since we last had occasion
to use this decanter 
lancelot was an outstanding
agent and a true kingsman 
he will be sorely missed 
to lancelot 
to lancelot
i intend to start the selection process
for lancelot s replacement tomorrow 
i want each of you to propose a candidate
and have them report to uk hq
no later than 9 p m  gmt 
thank you 
merlin 
come in 
lancelot was investigating
a group of mercenaries
who were experimenting
with biological weaponry 
glasses  gentlemen  please 
uganda  2012  synthetic cathinone 
you put it in the water supply
of a guerrilla army base 
rage  cannibalism  multiple fatalities 
chechnya  2013 
insurgents turned on one another 
indisputable  the work of our mercenaries
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind 
so what happened to lancelot 
he tracked them to this
property in argentina 
and while he had them under surveillance 
he became aware that they
had effected a kidnapping 
so he executed a solo rescue mission   
which failed 
this is his last transmission 
kidnap victim is professor james arnold
  who is he 
  some climate change doomsayer 
expounded something called gaia theory about
the world healing itself or some such 
but what s curious  is
he s not actually missing 
this is professor arnold 
at imperial college  this morning 
it s all yours  and don t forget
your membership proposal 
try picking a more suitable
candidate this time 
17 years
and still evolving with the times remains
an entirely foreign concept to you 
need i remind you  i wouldn t be here
if it weren t for that young man 
he was as much kingsman material
as any of them 
more so 
but he wasn t exactly one of us  was he 
let s face it  galahad 
your little experiment failed 
with respect  arthur  you re a snob 
with respect 
the world is changing 
there s a reason why aristocrats
developed weak chins 
eggsy

yeah   
shit  what 
yes  i totally understand 
eggsy
would you like a lift home 
who are you 
the man who got you released 
that ain t an answer 
a little gratitude would be nice 
my name is harry hart 
and i gave you that medal 
your father saved my life 
so before you was a tailor  were
you in the army 
like an officer 
not quite 
so where was you posted  iraq or something 
sorry  eggsy  classified 
but my dad saved your life  yeah 
the day your father died 
i missed something 
and if it weren t for
his courage  my mistake
would have cost the lives
of every man present 
so i owe him 
your father was a brave man 
a good man 
and having read your files  i d think he d be
bitterly disappointed in the choices you ve made 
you can t talk to me like that 
huge iq  great performance
in primary school 
and it all went tits up 
drugs  petty crime  never had a job 
do you think there s a lot
of jobs going around here 
doesn t explain why you
gave up your hobbies 
first prize  regional
under tens  gymnastics
two years in a row  your coach had you
pegged as olympic team material 
yeah and when you grow up
around someone like my
step dad  you pick up new
hobbies pretty quick 
ah of course  always someone else s fault 
and who s to blame you for
quitting the marines 
you were halfway through training 
doing brilliantly  but you gave up 
because my mum went mental 
banging on about losing
me as well as my dad 
then we wouldn t be cannon
fodder for snobs like
you  judging people like
me from your ivory towers 
with no thought about why we do what we do 
we ain t got much choice  you get me 
and if we was born with the same
silver spoon up our arses   
we would do just as well as you 
if not better 
what the fuck you doing here 
you taking a piss 
some more examples of young men who
simply need a silver suppository 
ya  they are exceptions  come on 
nonsense  we haven t finished our drinks 
after you nicked his
car  dean says you re a
fair guy i don t give a
shit what your mum says 
listen  boys 
i ve had a rather emotional day 
so whatever your beef with eggsy is 
and i m sure it s well founded   
i would appreciate it enormously
if you could just leave us in peace   
until i finish this
lovely pint of guinness 
you should get out of the way  granddaddy 
or you ll get hurt a lot 
he ain t joking  you should go 
excuse me 
if you re looking for another rent boy 
they re on the corner of smith s street 
manners   
maketh   
man 
do you know what that means 
then let me teach you a lesson 
are we going to stand around here all day 
or are we going to fight 
you fucking    you fucking   
 stun 
amnesia
sorry about that 
needed to let off a little steam 
heard  yesterday a friend of mine died 
he knew your father too  actually 
i do apologise  eggsy  i should not
have done this in front of you 
no  please   i won t say nothing 
i swear 
if there is one thing i can
do  it s keep my mouth shut 
  you won t tell a soul 
  i swear  i ve never crossed anyone out 
is that a promise 
  on my life 
much appreciated  eggsy 
you re right about the snobs 
but there too  there are exceptions 
best of luck with everything 
in celebrity news  the richmond valentine
movie premiered in hollywood  last night 
the story of the internet
billionaire s rise to power
is expected to be this
award season s hot ticket 
one notable absence
from the red carpet was
iggy azalea  still missing
three days after   
eggsy  just go  please
because he s gonna   
  please don t hurt him 
  fuck off 
shut the fuck up 
who was with you in that fucking pub 
  i want to know the name of the geezer you was with 
  i was not with anyone 
i don t know what you re on about 
  fucking tell me his name 
  i don t know what you re fucking on about 
you listen to me  i want to know who you
was with in that pub  you understand 
i want to know his fucking name 
i don t know what you re fucking on about 
fuck off 
i could kill you right now and no one
in the the world will know it 
but i would 
i have enough evidence
on your activities to
have you locked up for
the rest of your life 
mister dean anthony baker 
so i suggest you leave the boy alone 
or i shall be forced to deliver it
to the appropriate authorities 
eggsy  meet me at the tailor s
i told you about 
what the fuck s going on here 
eggsy  you fucking maggot   
here s we gotta arrest him 
hey    hey    hey
come here 
you wanker 
i ll have you soon 
i ve never met a tailor before 
but i know you ain t one 
come with me 
come on here 
what do you see 
someone who wants to know
what the fuck is going on 
i see a young man with potential 
a young man who is loyal 
who can do as he is asked 
and who wants to do something
good with his life 
did you see the film  trading places  
no
how about  nikita  
 pretty woman  
all right 
my point is  the lack of a
silver spoon has set you
on a certain path  but
you needn t stay on it 
if you re prepare to adapt and learn 
you can transform 
oh  like in  my fair lady  
i know you re full of surprises 
yes  like  my fair lady 
only in this case  i am offering you the
opportunity to become a kingsman 
a tailor 
a kingsman agent 
  like a spy 
  of sorts 
interested 
you think i ve got anything to lose 
since 1849  kingsman tailors have clothed
the world s most powerful individuals 
in 1919  a great number of them had lost
their heirs to world war 1 
that meant a lot of money
going un inherited 
and a lot of powerful men with a desire
to preserve peace and protect life 
our founders realized
that they could channel
that wealth and influence
for a greater good 
and so began our adventure 
an independent international
intelligence agency
operating at the highest
level of discretion 
without the politics and bureaucracy   
that undermine the integrity of
government run spy organizations 
a suit is the modern gentleman s armor 
and the kingsman agents
are the new knights 
  how deep does this fucking thing go 
  deep enough 
shit  we re late 
your father had the same look on his face 
as did i 
come on 
  galahad 
  my code name 
late again  sir 
good luck 
in you go 
fall in 
ladies and gentlemen  my name is merlin 
you are about to embark
on what is probably the
most dangerous job
interview in the world 
one of you and only one of you
will become the next lancelot 
can anybody tell me what this is 
  a body bag  sir 
  correct 
  charlie  isn t it 
  yes  sir 
in a moment  you will
each collect a body bag 
you will write your
name on that bag 
you will write the details of your
next of kin  on that bag 
this represents your
acknowledgment of
the risks that you
are about to face   
as well as your
agreement to strict
confidentiality  which
incidentally if you break   
will result in you and your next
of kin being in that bag 
is that understood 
excellent 
fall out 
roxanne  but  
call me roxy 
  i am eggsy 
  eggy 
no  eggsy
eggy    and where did
they dig you up 
you know we are not allowed
to discuss who proposed us 
no need to bite his head off 
charlie s only making
conversation  right charlie 
i m digby 
digby 
eggy  this is
rufus 
rufus  eggy 
so eggy  are you
oxford or cambridge 
neither 
st  andrews  durham 
oh wait  i think we may have met 
did you serve me at the mcdonalds
in winchester service station 
no 
but if i had  i give you an
extra helping of secret sauce 
it s definitely st  andrews 
  just ignore them 
  do you need a pen 
cheers 
  amelia  isn t it 
  amelia 
  eggsy
hi eggsy 
don t take any notice
of those guys 
that s what i told him 
it s just scare tactics 
classic army technique 
no one s gonna die 
shame 
great  so you don t know 
the cia don t know 
nobody knows who this guy is 
fine 
seriously  it s fine 
well  it s not really fine but
it s not why i m here 
hell man  you know me 
money s not my issue 
i could have retired straight
out of mit  fucked off
to some island and let
the business run itself 
nobody told me to try
and save the planet 
i wanted to 
climate change research  lobbying 
years of studying  billions of dollars 
and you know why i quit 
because the last time i checked 
the planet was still fucked 
hence  my epiphany 
money won t solve this 
those idiots who call
themselves politicians 
they bury their heads
in the sand   
and stood for nothing but re election 
so i spent the last two years trying
to find a real solution 
and i found it 
now  if you really want to make
the world a better place   
i suggest you open
your fucking ears
because i m about
to tell it to you 
go on  mr  valentine 
i m still listening 
as long as you agree to all my terms 
no one panic  listen to me  stay calm 
  use snorkels 
  use snorkels 
  shower heads 
  shower heads 
she s right  go  fucking go 
and what about pulling the fucking door 
congratulations
on completing your first task 
charlie  roxy  well done 
for those who  re still confused
if you get a breathing
tube run the u bend of
a toilet  you have an
unlimited air supply 
simple physics  worth remembering 
eggsy 
well done for spotting
that was a two way mirror 
he is probably seen enough of  em 
yeah you can all wipe those
smirks off your faces 
because as far as
i am concerned 
every single one
of you has failed 
you all forgot the most important thing 
teamwork 
so much for classic army technique 
35 
5 
that s it 
hello 
can i help you 
yes  i have a question
about anthropogenic force 
really  well  it s actually
quite fascinating 
my colleague died
trying to rescue you 
and i m sure you saw how
well trained he was 
so i suggest you tell me who kidnapped you
and why they let you go 
i have no idea what you re talking about   
i can not say  it was   
oh for god s sake  i barely touched you 
how man are   
 implant activated 
fuck that guy  whoever he is  i m gonna   
he made me kill
professor arnold 
goddamn loved professor arnold 
well the good news is
we know the emergency and
surveillance systems work 
you know what is not good news 
 my colleague died  
that s what he said 
this is an organization
and they are all over us 
whoever you spoke to   
i told you  i am in contact with the
kgb  mi6  mossad and beijing 
they all insist he
wasn t one of theirs 
beijing 
so freaky how there s no recognizable name
for the chinese secret service 
now that s what you call a secret  right 
you know what 
fuck it  we need to speed things up 
bring the product release forward 
they are only halfway into production 
speeding it will cost a fortune 
do i look like i give a fuck 
just get it done  
as some of you will have
learned last night 
teamwork is paramount here at kingsman 
we are here to enhance your skills 
test you to limits 
which is why you re gonna pick a puppy 
wherever you go  your dog goes 
you will care for it 
you will teach it 
and by the time they are fully trained 
so will you be 
those of you who are still here  that is 
do you understand 
choose your puppy 
a poodle 
what 
they are gun dogs 
oldest working breed 
easy to train 
a pug 
it s a bulldog  isn t it 
it would get bigger though  wouldn t it 
ssshhhit
his mri shows no signs of concussion 
no direct brain trauma at all 
how much longer can he be out 
that s the million dollar question 
we don t know what he was
exposed to in there 
what about harry s footage 
it didn t stream to
his home terminal 
encrypted and uncrackable 
if and when he comes round 
you might wanna have
a word with him about
sharing his password 
is he gonna be alright 
we need to have patience  eggsy 
but there is hope  okay 
if i were you  i d concentrate
on your training 
make it through the
test  make him proud 
come on  j  b  come on 
i am not coming last cause of you 
j  b  i ll shoot you  goddamn 
i ll fucking shoot you 
merlin said we re not allowed to hold you 
bollocks 
water 
come on then 
eggsy  you forget it 
oh what s wrong mate 
can t take a joke 
seriously  you ll get turned out and it s
just not worth it 
maybe i don t give a fuck
about getting kicked out 
really  come on  you player 
charlie  fuck off 
yeah  go on  walk away 
dickhead 
come on  j  b 
it s all right 
you have exactly one hour
to complete the test 
starting now 
  new target  800 meters 
  it s unbelievable  you re still here 
lingering on like some big steaming shit
that just won t flush 
roger that 
target identified  and how
about you shut the fuck up 
positive discrimination 
it s worth it 
like those fucking steak
cooks who go down seaways
because their mum s a
one legged lesbian 
you don t know fuck all about my grades 
oh forgive me  i m sure
you re highly educated 
fire when ready 
how s that for positive discrimination 
i wanna thank you both for listening 
and i really  really appreciate
your traveling all this way 
your royal highness 
and you too  prime minister 
i think this is quite brilliant 
it is absolutely brilliant 
you are completely crazy 
i m sorry  your royal highness   
but you got a big role to play   
in getting the scandinavian
region back on track 
you re popular 
inspirational and
you have the power to
galvanize the people 
now whether you re on board or not   
i am going to have to insist
on getting you somewhere i
can ensure your safety 
how about you  prime minister 
you in or out 
well  i think it s
about time that
a politician did
something that   
actually made a difference 
too true 
take her away 
drink 
why not 
wait  help me 
do not worry  no harm will
come to the princess 
well i m republican anyway 
so it really doesn t matter 
release the princess 
okay  you re done 
not too bad  right 
i hardly felt a thing 
welcome aboard 
the pleasure is all mine 
ever heard of knocking 
only when i m casing
a place to rob 
amelia said you wanted to see me 
hope j  b  s training is going
as well as yours is 
sit 
congratulations on making it
to the final six candidates 
your test results are even
better than i could ve hoped 
come in 
eggsy  i need to have a
private conversation 
you re dismissed 
nonsense  let him observe 
he d learn a thing or two 
as you wish  take a look at this 
fucking hell  that s his    harry 
you blew up his head 
its a bit much  isn t it 
actually  the explosion was caused
by an implant in his neck 
here  under that scar 
did my hardware pick up the
signal that triggered it 
fortunately  yes 
unfortunately  the ip address
it traced it to is registered
to the valentine corporation 
it s not much of a lead 
they have millions of employees worldwide 
no  richmond valentine is a genius 
did you not see his announcement today 
no 
we each spend on average
 2 000 a year on cellphone
and internet usage 
it gives me great
pleasure to announce 
those days are over 
as of tomorrow  every man  woman and child
can claim a free sim card   
compatible with any cellphone 
any computer and   
utilize my communications network
for free 
free calls  free internet  for everyone 
forever 
valentine s assistant has
the same implant scar 
i think mr  valentine and i
shall have a tête à tête 
he s having a gala dinner next week 
i ll get you an invitation 
you need to be careful though 
since you were out  hundreds of vips
have gone missing 
no ransom notes 
exactly like professor arnold 
then i suggest you make my alias
somebody worth kidnapping 
you don t like heights 
yes it s okay i ve done it before 
probably alright if i don t think of it 
hey  you ll be alright 
you re top of the class 
listen up  your mission is to land in the
target without the radar detecting you 
if i read you on the radar or
you miss the target  you go home 
is that understood 
drop zone coming up  20 seconds 
here we go 
  i really don t think i can do this 
  of course you can t 
get to the back and i ll
show you how  yeah 
eggsy  eggsy   wait  hang on 
roxy  just stop fucking about 
follow me  yeah 
roxy  it s now or never 
jump 
good girl  rox 
i m glad you made it 
my my  you re all very cheerful 
you really think it was gonna
be that straightforward 
any idiot can read a heads up display 
a kingsman agent
needs to be able
to solve problems
under pressure 
like what to do when one of your group
has no parachute 
no parachute  who 
fuck  which one 
what do we do 
i told you  aim for the target
coming under the radar 
and i hope not to be
scraping one of you up 
but if i do have to and
you re inside the target   
means i ll be very impressed 
everybody listen  i ve got a plan 
pair up  grab the closest person to you 
rufus  come on

jape off your shoulder 
mr  devere  it s a pleasure to meet you

intrigued to meet you 
there are not many
billionaires i do not know 
i don t doubt it 
obviously  i have had my people
looking into your affairs
and that s some pretty
old money you re from 
how d your folks make it 
property  mostly 
property in the markets 
nothing personal  if that s your concern 
no  i m just in to find out what kind of
person you are  i m sure you understand that 
i most certainly do 
hope you re hungry 
i m famished 
good  grab a seat 
i ll have the big mac  please 
great choice 
but nothing beats two cheeseburgers
with secret sauce 
tastes great with
this  45 lafite 
a classic pairing 
may i suggest twinkies with
1937 château d yquem for pudding 
i like it
so you want to donate to my foundation 
you are aware that i wind
things down in that area  right 
climate changes affect us all 
mr  valentine 
and you are one of the few powerful people
who seems to share my concerns 
i stepped things down because
i wasn t getting anywhere 
every bit of research kept
pointing to the same thing 
the carbon emissions are a red
herring  and we are past the
point of no return no matter
what remedial actions we take 
you know your shit 
i sometimes envy the blissful
ignorance of those less well versed
in their shit 
as professor arnold always said 
 humankind is the only virus
cursed to live with the
horrifying knowledge of its
host s fragile mortality  
there are not a lot of
people who know about him 
do you like spy movies  mr  devere 
nowadays  they re all a little
serious for my taste 
but the old ones    marvelous 
give me a farfetched
theatrical plot any day 
the old bond movies  oh  man 
ah  when i was a kid 
that was my dream job 
a gentleman spy 
i always felt the old bond films were
only as good as the villain 
as a child  i rather fancied
a futuristic colorful megalomaniac 
what a shame we both had to grow up 
bon appétit 
just give me a couple of days
to think over your proposal 
i ll have my people get in touch with yours
and it s all good 
thank you for such a  happy meal  
  well  you want me to follow him 
  nah 
i put a nano tracker gel in the wine 
we ll know his every move for the next 24
hours  finally find out who he works for 
valentine didn t let
me out of his sight 
all i got was this 
on the way in 
south glade mission church
is a hate group based in kentucky 
the fbi have been
monitoring them for years 
do you think valentine
is a supporter 
no evidence yet of a direct connection 
but i ll keep looking 
oh  by the way 
the ever growing list
of missing persons   
now includes scandinavian royalty 
royal crown princess tilde 
just let me out  you psycho 
i told you  you re free
to go anytime you want 
as long as you agree
to my conditions 
i don t agree 
and i am never ever going to agree 
enough yet 
bitch 
the list of missing celebrities and dignitaries
has continued to grow in recent weeks 
and world leaders are coming under
increasing pressure to provide answers 
we are doing everything in our
power to find princess tilde 
you know  governments and security forces
worldwide are working together   
to find the person behind these abductions 
in other news  people all
over the world continue to
wait in line day and night
to get their free sim card 
mrs  p  you get one 
yeah  i ve been queuing up all day 
this unprecedented giveaway
by the philanthropist richmond valentine   
has already seen over a
billion cards distributed 
at ease 
so you thought you were
done for the day  huh 
probably not 
  a party 
  tonight  in london 
  who is this 
  your target 
your mission is to use your
nlp training to win over
the individual in the
photograph in your envelope 
and when i say  win over   i
do mean in the biblical sense 
easy
most girls love a bit rough 
we ll see about that  yeah 
who is that anyway 
i just had to come over
and say  amazing eyes  
  you wearing color contacts 
  no 
  you so are
  oh my god   negging   that s hilarious 
i haven t had anyone try
that since the 90s 
excuse me 
 negging   saying something
negative to a pretty
girl in order to undermine
her social value 
its supposed to make you
want to win his approval 
absurdly basic neurolinguistic
programming technique 
is it just me or does this
champagne taste a little bit funny 
that s an acquired taste  mate 
  i think it s just cheap 
  get one of these instead  they re delicious 
you know  if you re interested in ornamental
techniques  this guy is textbook 
see what he just did  its
called an  opinion opener 
he got you talking with
a neutral question   
got all of us involved in the conversation 
so that you crave individual attention 
nah  i m just saying that the
champagne tastes weird   
lady sophie  montague herring 
phone call for you at reception 
  be right back 
  see you in a bit  yeah 
  good job  rox  i m feeling a bit rough 
  you alright 
sorry to eavesdrop   
but there is a much easier way to
guarantee getting someone home 
rohypnol 
or even something stronger 
who the fuck are you 
where am i 
this knife can save your life 
fuck
my employer s got two
questions for you  eggsy 
what the fuck is kingsman 
and who is harry hart 
i do not know what the fuck that is 
oh eggsy  i just killed
two of your friends
because they gave me the
same bullshit answer 
just cut the fucking ropes  please 
eggsy  is the kingsman worth dying for 
fuck you
congratulations 
bloody well done 
  how d the others do 
  roxy passed with flying colors 
charlie s up next 
want to watch 
yeah  alright 
is kingsman really worth dying for 
no fuck  it isn t shit
i ll tell all you want  please 
chester king s arthur 
head of a spy agency 
it s called kingsman 
thank you charlie  much appreciated 
come on  it wasn t the fucking deal
i had such high hopes for you 
you are a bloody disgrace 
i m so sorry
please untie me 
untie yourself 
arthur  please 
anyone    no
galahad  percival  congratulations 
you candidates have reached the
final stage of the testing process 
as tradition allows  you now have
24 hours to spend with them 
eggsy  you should know
your father reached this point 
from now on 
there are no safety nets 
understood 
good  dismissed 
charlie  time to go home 
fuck you
my fucking dad s gonna hear about this 
 to pee or not to pee  
that was the headline the day after i
diffused a dirty bomb in paris 
   germany 1   england 5  
  i missed that game 
i was breaking up an undercover
spy ring at pentagon 
my first mission 
i foiled the assassination
of margaret thatcher 
not everybody had thanked you for that one 
the point is  eggsy  nobody thanked
me for any of them 
front page news  and all these occasions
were celebrity nonsense 
because it is the nature of kingsman that
our achievements remain secret 
a gentleman s name should appear in the
newspaper only three times 
when he s born  when he
marries and when he dies 
and we are  first and foremost  gentlemen 
pretty fucked then 
its like charlie said 
i am just a pleb 
being a gentleman has nothing to do with
the circumstances of one s birth 
being a gentleman is something one learns 
yeah  but how 
alright  first lesson 
you should have asked me
before you took a seat 
second lesson 
how to make a proper martini 
yes  harry 
goddamn it  it fucking hurts 
you are the one who asked for
a biometric security system 
what s wrong with
a simple switch 
a simple switch 
this is an extremely
dangerous machine 
it should only be operated by someone
responsible and sane as me 
bad shit can happen
if it falls into the wrong hands 
sync main terminal
  are we done here  shit
  no  now this one 
for the test of the church 
this one just has a short range 
a simple switch will do 
so you gonna teach me how to talk proper
like in  my fair lady  
that d be absurd 
being a gentleman has nothing
to do with one s accent 
its about being at ease in one s own skin 
as hemingway said  there is nothing noble
in being superior to your fellow man  
 true nobility is being superior
to your former self  
now  the first thing every gentleman
needs is a good suit 
by which i mean a bespoke suit 
never off the peg 
and kingsman suits are
always bulletproof 
so let s get you measured 
and whether you get the job
or not  you will have a
lasting and useful memento
of your time at kingsman 
i m so sorry  sir  but a gentleman
is completing his fitting 
fitting room 2 is available 
one does not use
fitting room 2   
when one is popping one s cherry 
perhaps i ll show you fitting
room 3  while we wait 
  so we going up or down 
  neither 
  is this it 
  of course not  pull the hook on your left 
oh  yes
very very nice 
you re going to need a pair of shoes
to go with your suit 
an oxford is any formal shoe 
with open lacing 
this additional decorative
piece is called broguing 
   oxford s  not brogue s  
  words to live by  eggsy 
words to live by 
try a pair 
your weapon scores are
excellent  by the way 
these you re familiar with 
and this is our standard issue pistol 
its quite unique  as you all
see it  it also fires a
shotgun cartridge for use in
messy close range situations 
how do they feel  now do your
very best in impersonation
of a german aristocrat s
formal greeting 
no  eggsy 
that is sick 
in the old days  they had a
phone in the heel as well 
how do i get it back in 
it is coated with one
of the fastest acting
neurotoxins known to
man  so very carefully 
i had a lot of fun with this 
one of our finest examples
of chemical engineering 
poison  harmless when ingested 
but at a time 
convenient to you   
it can be remotely activated 
primed 
lethal 
and what about these  what do these do 
electrocute you 
  don t be ridiculous  it s a hand grenade 
  shut up   
if you want to electrocute someone 
you ll need a signet ring 
a gentleman traditionally wears
the signet on his left hand  but
a kingsman wears it on whatever
hand happens to be dominant 
if you touch the contact behind the ring 
it delivers 50 000 volts 
and what about them  what
makes them so special 
nothing  that technology is caught up
with the spy world 
put it back  eggsy 
perfect timing  gentleman s just finished 
mr  devere 
what a coincidence 
you re totally the
reason i m here 
when you left my house  i was searching for
that dope ass smoking jacket you had on 
and since i m going as royal ascot  apparently
you need one of these penguin suits   
here i am  what are you doing here 
what s up man  richmond valentine 
this is my new valet 
i was just introducing him to my tailor 
another coincidence  so am i 
  did you have any chance to think further on my proposal 
  most definitely 
my people will be getting in
touch with you very soon 
i guarantee it 
a word of advice  ascot requires top hat 
i might suggest lock   co 
hatters 
st  james 
 lox   as in smoked fish 
as in  locked up  
i have trouble understanding
you people sometimes 
you all talk so funny 
gentlemen  would you look after him please 
now this is a dope ass top hat 
gazelle  lets go ascotting 
your hat is fine bill  come on 
don t make me late for the queen 
come on  gazelle  we re gonna be late 
how far is ascot  how far 
merlin said you wanted
to see me  sir 
sit down 
pretty dog  what s his name 
j b 
  as in  james bond  
  no 
   jason bourne  
  no  jack bauer 
bravo 
it pains me to admit it 
eggsy  but i think that
one day you might be as
good a spy as any of them 
take it 
shoot the dog 
this weapon is live 
shoot the dog 
give me the gun 
at least the girl s got balls 
get out 
i knew you couldn t make it 
go home 
merlin  send in roxy  please 
welcome to kingsman  lancelot 
oh god  i ve been so worried about you 
oh my dais  look how big you ve got 
  where is he 
  i am fine 
eggsy  please please  just
don t get involved   
no  i should never have
left you on your own 
this stops right now 
be right back 
oh mugsy  so you re back 
you nicked a fucking taxi now 
yeah  can i have a word about my mom s
black eye 
you wanna have a word with
me  you get out of that cab 
i ll knock you straight back
down on your fucking arse 
tell your muppets to go inside 
then i ll get out 
go on lads  there ll be two hits 
me and him and then he and the floor 
come on in  you prick 
let s see what you got  eh 
what are you doing 
remote car 
what are you doing 
now you ve gone all bollocks 
come on  he ll beat my fucking mother 
come back when you ve grown a pair  mugsy 
you throw away
your biggest opportunity
over a fucking dog 
and then you humiliate me
by stealing my boss s car 
you shot a dog just
to get a fucking job 
yes  i did 
mr pickle here reminds me of that
every time i take a shit 
you shot your dog
and had it stuffed 
you fucking freak 
no  i shot my dog and
then i brought him home
and continued to care
for him for the next eleven years
until he died of pancreatitis 
  what 
  it was a blank  eggsy 
it was a fucking blank 
remember amelia 
yeah
she didn t drown  she works in our tech
department in berlin  she s fine 
limits must be tested  a kingsman only condones
the risking of a life to save another 
as my father saved your life
even though your fuck up cost his 
what you ve get him stuffed here also 
can t you see that everything i have done
has been about trying to repay him 
harry  listen to this 
valentine s alarm is
saying something of note 
you know what i love about pen and paper 
nobody can hack into this shit 
our worldwide tour was a complete success 
we have total coverall 
  like when all your numbers in bingo are crossed out 
  bingo 
bingo  the game 
you have played bingo  right 
do i look like i play bingo 
point is   
if our tests go well at church tomorrow 
we are good to go 
south glade mission church 
  merlin  get the plane ready 
  will do
  i am so sorry  i m gonna do  
  you should be 
you stay right there 
i ll sort this mess out when i get back 
 kentucky  u s a 
and i say to you  bear witness 
watch the news  watch the news 
aids  floods
the blood of the innocents spilled 
and yet there are those
who doubt this is the wrath of god 
our filthy government condones sodomy 
divorce  abortion 
and yet some still doubt 
this is the work
of the antichrist 
you do not have to be a
jew  a nigger  a whore   
or an atheistic science
loving evolution spouter 
charming sermon 
can you see valentine anywhere 
so my friends  although he is a just god 
he is justly   
the one and there will be no turning back
are you sure we
are out of range 
we re over a 1000 feet away 
what s wrong 
  what if the calculations are wrong 
  you just have to trust me 
jews  nigger  fag lovers 
and the devil is burning
them for all eternity 
excuse me 
where are you going 
hey  what s your problem 
i am a catholic whore 
currently enjoying congress
out of wedlock with my
black jewish boyfriend   
who works in a military abortion clinic 
so hail satan  and have a
lovely afternoon  madam 
oh shit  he s leaving  i m
starting the test now 
hope enough of these
freaks have our sim cards 
ask you to sit down   
leave this church like the infidel you are 
you will eat your babies 
you will drown in the blood of the lord 
he will cast 
holy fuck 
shit  i can t watch this  get over here 
jesus   
galahad  can you hear me 
harry  harry   what the heck is going on 
just turn the volume down please 
i didn t expect it to
be that effective 
what kind of response
are we talking of 
100  
so everyone s been infected
whether they have sim card or not 
and its added benefit of
wiping out the kingsman 
not yet 
oh you need to see this 
what did you do to me 
i had no control 
i killed all those people 
  i wanted to 
  clever  isn t it 
in simple terms  its a
neurological wave that triggers
the centers of aggression
and switches off inhibitor 
transmitted through your nasty
free sim cards  i assume 
you know what this is like 
its like those old movies we both love 
now i m gonna tell you my whole plan   
and then i m gonna come up with some
absurd  convoluted way to kill you   
and then you ll find an equally
convoluted way to escape 
that sounds good to me 
well  this ain t that kind of movie 
no
is he dead 
that s usually what happens when
you shoot someone in the head 
  it feels good  right 
  no no  it does not feel good  it felt fucking awful 
what  you just killed how
many people in that church 
this is one guy 
no  no    no  they killed each other 
okay  send off the
countdown clock
this party starts tomorrow 
arthur 
  are you there 
  sadly  i am 
assemble the kingsman 
can t you see that everything i have done
has been about trying to repay him 
i see a young man
with potential 
who wants to do something
good with his life 
kingsman
arthur  harry is dead 
galahad is dead 
hence  we have just drunk a toast to him 
well then you know what
that psycho s doing 
how many people in the world
have got those sim cards 
valentine can send a signal
to any of them 
all of them  if they all go homicidal at
the same time  then  
indeed  and thanks to
galahad recordings
we have valentine s confession 
the intelligence has been passed on to the
relevant authorities 
our work is complete 
and a most distinguished legacy
for our fallen friend it is too 
and that s it 
come sit down  boy 
this is an 1815 napoleonic brandy 
and we only drink it
when we lose a kingsman 
galahad was very fond of you 
and on this occasion  i think it is
acceptable for us   
to bend the rules a little 
  these are all kingsmen 
  yes  our founder members 
i want you to join me in a toast 
to galahad 
to galahad 
harry said you don t like
to break the rules  often 
why now 
you re very good  eggsy 
perhaps i ll make you my
proposal for galahad s position 
provided we can see eye to eye
on certain political matters 
can you guess  
what this is 
i don t have to 
harry showed it 
you click it  i die 
i thought that brandy tasted a bit shit 
bravo 
valentine won you over  somehow
once he explained  i understood 
when you get a virus  you get a fever 
that s the human body raising its
core temperature to kill the virus 
planet earth works the same way 
global warming is the fever   
mankind is the virus 
we are making our planet sick 
a cull is our only hope 
if we do not reduce our
population ourselves 
there s only two
ways this can go 
the host kills the virus 
or the virus kills the host 
  either way   
  the result is the same 
the virus dies 
so valentine s gonna take care
of the population problem himself 
if we don t do something  nature will 
sometimes a culling is the only way to
ensure that this species survives 
and history will see valentine as the man
who saved humanity from extinction 
and he gets to pick and choose
who gets culled  does he 
all his rich mates  they get to live  and then when
he thinks its worth saving  he s keeping them safe 
  whether they agree with him or not 
  and you  eggsy 
in harry s honor  i am inviting you to
be part of a new world 
it s time to make your decision 
i would rather be with harry 
thanks 
so be it 
the problem with us
common types is 
that we are light fingered 
kingsman s taught me a lot 
but slight of hand   
yes  they re our our founder members 
i had that done already 
you dirty little fucking prick 
it s okay  lancelot  put it down 
it s verified 
arthur s phone s just
received an update text about
getting to safety  we
don t have a lot time 
  what you gonna do 
  the question is what we gonna do 
god knows who s in valentine s
pocket and who s not 
we ve no choice 
we are gonna have to deal
with this ourselves 
follow me 
  the fuck is this 
  i have no idea 
what you re playing with   
is a prototype personal
trans atmospheric vehicle 
it was developed as part of
reagan s star wars project 
its pretty basic  but
it should still work 
we re going to take out one
of valentine s satellites 
we re gonna break the chain 
stop the signal 
it will take him a couple
of hours to reboot it 
which buys us enough time for you to get me
into valentine s mainframe   
so i can shut it down 
lancelot  you are going to be using it 
get into your halo suit 
swedish air force
the swedish prime minister requesting
permission to land 
permission granted 
  please 
  thank you 
  so how many more are we expecting 
  not many  most have their own bunkers 
i figure we re just getting
really nervous once 
welcome  prime minister 
it seems the implant can emit
some kind of counter signal   
to ensure the wearer remains unaffected
by the waves from the sim card 
the waves that turns everyone
into a psycho killer 
quite  but what they probably didn t
tell anyone   
is that it can also super heat
their soft tissue at his command 
valentine s selected his chosen few
to get the countdown warning 
he had to be sure that it didn t
blow up to the wrong people beforehand 
and how does this help us right now 
it doesn t  roxy  here we go 
the higher you go 
the more the balloons expand 
when you reach the edge of the atmosphere 
they will explode 
you need to deploy your missile
just before that  okay 
the edge of the atmosphere 
and once you ve deployed  you ll need
to release for descent fast 
good luck 
you can do this  okay 
eggsy  come on 
time is not our friend 
getting in with arthur s invitation 
you gonna need to blend in 
  i m supposed to be arthur 
  his invitation s in his phone 
give them this and give
his real name  chester king 
  and what about you 
  i m the pilot  i m gonna stay here 
is that gonna fit me 
a bespoke suit always fits 
just be grateful harry
had it made for you 
get dressed 
the fuck s wrong with them 
i don t know  could have something
to do with mass genocide 
give me the mic 
everybody listen up 
what the fuck wrong with you people 
i just want to remind you that today
is a day of celebration 
we must put aside
all thoughts of death 
and focus on birth 
the birth of a new age 
we mustn t mourn those who
give their lives today 
we should honor their sacrifice 
she got my number to call me back    
and their role in saving
the human race 
we must put aside doubts and guilts 
you are the chosen people 
when folks tell their kids the story
of noah s ark  is noah the bad guy 
is god the bad guy 
how about the animals marching two by two 
of course not 
yes  that s it  so let s turn
that frown upside down 
eat  drink and party 
and i ll see you all in the new age 
rox  its me  how s the view 
  hideous 
  mine s pretty sweet 
  they made you one of these suits yet 
  no  not yet

look forward to then
