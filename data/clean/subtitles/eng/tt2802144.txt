arthur is in the dining room sir
arthur
galahad
the others were beginning to wonder if
we were going to have a double toast
gentlemen i am thankful to say
that its been 17 years
since we last had occasion
to use this decanter
lancelot was an outstanding
agent and a true kingsman
he will be sorely missed
to lancelot
to lancelot
i intend to start the selection process
for lancelots replacement tomorrow
i want each of you to propose a candidate
and have them report to uk hq
no later than 9 pm gmt
thank you
merlin
come in
lancelot was investigating
a group of mercenaries
who were experimenting
with biological weaponry
glasses gentlemen please
uganda 2012 synthetic cathinone
you put it in the water supply
of a guerrilla army base
rage cannibalism multiple fatalities
chechnya 2013
insurgents turned on one another
indisputable the work of our mercenaries
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind
so what happened to lancelot
he tracked them to this
property in argentina
and while he had them under surveillance
he became aware that they
had effected a kidnapping
so he executed a solo rescue mission
which failed
this is his last transmission
kidnap victim is professor james arnold
who is he
some climate change doomsayer
expounded something called gaia theory about
the world healing itself or some such
but whats curious is
hes not actually missing
this is professor arnold
at imperial college this morning
its all yours and dont forget
your membership proposal
try picking a more suitable
candidate this time
17 years
and still evolving with the times remains
an entirely foreign concept to you
need i remind you i wouldnt be here
if it werent for that young man
he was as much kingsman material
as any of them
more so
but he wasnt exactly one of us was he
lets face it galahad
your little experiment failed
with respect arthur youre a snob
with respect
the world is changing
theres a reason why aristocrats
developed weak chins

a little gratitude would be nice
my name is harry hart
and i gave you that medal
your father saved my life
so before you was a tailor were
you in the army
like an officer
not quite
so where was you posted iraq or something
sorry eggsy classified
but my dad saved your life yeah
the day your father died
i missed something
and if it werent for
his courage my mistake
would have cost the lives
of every man present
so i owe him
your father was a brave man
a good man
and having read your files id think hed be
bitterly disappointed in the choices youve made
you cant talk to me like that
huge iq great performance
in primary school
and it all went tits up
drugs petty crime never had a job
do you think theres a lot
of jobs going around here
doesnt explain why you
gave up your hobbies
first prize regional
under tens gymnastics
two years in a row your coach had you
pegged as olympic team material
yeah and when you grow up
around someone like my
stepdad you pick up new
hobbies pretty quick
ah of course always someone elses fault
and whos to blame you for
quitting the marines
you were halfway through training
doing brilliantly but you gave up
because my mum went mental
banging on about losing
me as well as my dad
then we wouldnt be cannon
fodder for snobs like
you judging people like
me from your ivory towers
with no thought about why we do what we do
we aint got much choice you get me
and if we was born with the same
silver spoon up our arses
we would do just as well as you
if not better
what the fuck you doing here
you taking a piss
some more examples of young men who
simply need a silver suppository
ya they are exceptions come on
nonsense we havent finished our drinks
after you nicked his
car dean says youre a
fair guy i dont give a
shit what your mum says
listen boys
ive had a rather emotional day
so whatever your beef with eggsy is
and im sure its well founded
i would appreciate it enormously
if you could just leave us in peace
until i finish this
lovely pint of guinness
you should get out of the way granddaddy
or youll get hurt a lot
he aint joking you should go
excuse me
if youre looking for another rent boy
theyre on the corner of smiths street
manners
maketh
man
do you know what that means
then let me teach you a lesson
are we going to stand around here all day
or are we going to fight
you fucking you fucking
stun
amnesia
sorry about that
needed to let off a little steam
heard yesterday a friend of mine died
he knew your father too actually
i do apologise eggsy i should not
have done this in front of you
no please i wont say nothing
i swear
if there is one thing i can
do its keep my mouth shut
you wont tell a soul
i swear ive never crossed anyone out
is that a promise
on my life
much appreciated eggsy
youre right about the snobs
but there too there are exceptions
best of luck with everything
in celebrity news the richmond valentine
movie premiered in hollywood last night
the story of the internet
billionaires rise to power
is expected to be this
award seasons hot ticket
one notable absence
from the red carpet was
iggy azalea still missing
three days after
eggsy just go please
because hes gonna
please dont hurt him
fuck off
shut the fuck up
who was with you in that fucking pub
i want to know the name of the geezer you was with
i was not with anyone
i dont know what youre on about
fucking tell me his name
i dont know what youre fucking on about
you listen to me i want to know who you
was with in that pub you understand
i want to know his fucking name
i dont know what youre fucking on about
fuck off
i could kill you right now and no one
in the the world will know it
but i would
i have enough evidence
on your activities to
have you locked up for
the rest of your life
mister dean anthony baker
so i suggest you leave the boy alone
or i shall be forced to deliver it
to the appropriate authorities
eggsy meet me at the tailors
i told you about
what the fucks going on here
eggsy you fucking maggot
heres we gotta arrest him
hey hey hey
come here
you wanker
ill have you soon
ive never met a tailor before
but i know you aint one
come with me
come on here
what do you see
someone who wants to know
what the fuck is going on
i see a young man with potential
a young man who is loyal
who can do as he is asked
and who wants to do something
good with his life
did you see the film trading places
no
how about nikita
pretty woman
all right
my point is the lack of a
silver spoon has set you
on a certain path but
you neednt stay on it
if youre prepare to adapt and learn
you can transform
oh like in my fair lady
i know youre full of surprises
yes like my fair lady
only in this case i am offering you the
opportunity to become a kingsman
a tailor
a kingsman agent
like a spy
of sorts
interested
you think ive got anything to lose
since 1849 kingsman tailors have clothed
the worlds most powerful individuals
in 1919 a great number of them had lost
their heirs to world war 1
that meant a lot of money
going uninherited
and a lot of powerful men with a desire
to preserve peace and protect life
our founders realized
that they could channel
that wealth and influence
for a greater good
and so began our adventure
an independent international
intelligence agency
operating at the highest
level of discretion
without the politics and bureaucracy
that undermine the integrity of
government run spy organizations
a suit is the modern gentlemans armor
and the kingsman agents
are the new knights
how deep does this fucking thing go
deep enough
shit were late
your father had the same look on his face
as did i
come on
galahad
my code name
late again sir
good luck
in you go
fall in
ladies and gentlemen my name is merlin
you are about to embark
on what is probably the
most dangerous job
interview in the world
one of you and only one of you
will become the next lancelot
can anybody tell me what this is
a body bag sir
correct
charlie isnt it
yes sir
in a moment you will
each collect a body bag
you will write your
name on that bag
you will write the details of your
next of kin on that bag
this represents your
acknowledgment of
the risks that you
are about to face
as well as your
agreement to strict
confidentiality which
incidentally if you break
will result in you and your next
of kin being in that bag
is that understood
excellent
fall out
roxanne but
call me roxy
i am eggsy
eggy
no eggsy
eggy and where did
they dig you up
you know we are not allowed
to discuss who proposed us
no need to bite his head off
charlies only making
conversation right charlie
im digby
digby
eggy this is
rufus
rufus eggy
so eggy are you
oxford or cambridge
neither
st andrews durham
oh wait i think we may have met
did you serve me at the mcdonalds
in winchester service station
no
but if i had i give you an
extra helping of secret sauce
its definitely st andrews
just ignore them
do you need a pen
cheers
amelia isnt it
amelia
eggsy
hi eggsy
dont take any notice
of those guys
thats what i told him
its just scare tactics
classic army technique
no ones gonna die
shame
great so you dont know
the cia dont know
nobody knows who this guy is
fine
seriously its fine
well its not really fine but
its not why im here
hell man you know me
moneys not my issue
i could have retired straight
out of mit fucked off
to some island and let
the business run itself
nobody told me to try
and save the planet
i wanted to
climate change research lobbying
years of studying billions of dollars
and you know why i quit
because the last time i checked
the planet was still fucked
hence my epiphany
money wont solve this
those idiots who call
themselves politicians
they bury their heads
in the sand
and stood for nothing but reelection
so i spent the last two years trying
to find a real solution
and i found it
now if you really want to make
the world a better place
i suggest you open
your fucking ears
because im about
to tell it to you
go on mr valentine
im still listening
as long as you agree to all my terms
no one panic listen to me stay calm
use snorkels
use snorkels
shower heads
shower heads
shes right go fucking go
and what about pulling the fucking door
congratulations
on completing your first task
charlie roxy well done
for those who re still confused
if you get a breathing
tube run the ubend of
a toilet you have an
unlimited air supply
simple physics worth remembering
eggsy
well done for spotting
that was a twoway mirror
he is probably seen enough of em
yeah you can all wipe those
smirks off your faces
because as far as
i am concerned
every single one
of you has failed
you all forgot the most important thing
teamwork
so much for classic army technique
thats it
hello
can i help you
yes i have a question
about anthropogenic force
really well its actually
quite fascinating
my colleague died
trying to rescue you
and im sure you saw how
welltrained he was
so i suggest you tell me who kidnapped you
and why they let you go
i have no idea what youre talking about
i can not say it was
oh for gods sake i barely touched you
how man are
implant activated
fuck that guy whoever he is im gonna
he made me kill
professor arnold
goddamn loved professor arnold
well the good news is
we know the emergency and
surveillance systems work
you know what is not good news
my colleague died
thats what he said
this is an organization
and they are all over us
whoever you spoke to
i told you i am in contact with the
kgb mi6 mossad and beijing
they all insist he
wasnt one of theirs
beijing
so freaky how theres no recognizable name
for the chinese secret service
now thats what you call a secret right
you know what
fuck it we need to speed things up
bring the product release forward
they are only halfway into production
speeding it will cost a fortune
do i look like i give a fuck
just get it done
as some of you will have
learned last night
teamwork is paramount here at kingsman
we are here to enhance your skills
test you to limits
which is why youre gonna pick a puppy
wherever you go your dog goes
you will care for it
you will teach it
and by the time they are fully trained
so will you be
those of you who are still here that is
do you understand
choose your puppy
a poodle
what
they are gun dogs
oldest working breed
easy to train
a pug
its a bulldog isnt it
it would get bigger though wouldnt it
ssshhhit
his mri shows no signs of concussion
no direct brain trauma at all
how much longer can he be out
thats the milliondollar question
we dont know what he was
exposed to in there
what about harrys footage
it didnt stream to
his home terminal
encrypted and uncrackable
if and when he comes round
you might wanna have
a word with him about
sharing his password
is he gonna be alright
we need to have patience eggsy
but there is hope okay
if i were you id concentrate
on your training
make it through the
test make him proud
come on j b come on
i am not coming last cause of you
j b ill shoot you goddamn
ill fucking shoot you
merlin said were not allowed to hold you
bollocks
water
come on then
eggsy you forget it
oh whats wrong mate
cant take a joke
seriously youll get turned out and its
just not worth it
maybe i dont give a fuck
about getting kicked out
really come on you player
charlie fuck off
yeah go on walk away
dickhead
come on j b
its all right
you have exactly one hour
to complete the test
starting now
new target 800 meters
its unbelievable youre still here
lingering on like some big steaming shit
that just wont flush
roger that
target identified and how
about you shut the fuck up
positive discrimination
its worth it
like those fucking steak
cooks who go down seaways
because their mums a
onelegged lesbian
you dont know fuckall about my grades
oh forgive me im sure
youre highly educated
fire when ready
hows that for positive discrimination
i wanna thank you both for listening
and i really really appreciate
your traveling all this way
your royal highness
and you too prime minister
i think this is quite brilliant
it is absolutely brilliant
you are completely crazy
im sorry your royal highness
but you got a big role to play
in getting the scandinavian
region back on track
youre popular
inspirational and
you have the power to
galvanize the people
now whether youre on board or not
i am going to have to insist
on getting you somewhere i
can ensure your safety
how about you prime minister
you in or out
well i think its
about time that
a politician did
something that
actually made a difference
too true
take her away
drink
why not
wait help me
do not worry no harm will
come to the princess
well im republican anyway
so it really doesnt matter
release the princess
okay youre done
not too bad right
i hardly felt a thing
welcome aboard
the pleasure is all mine
ever heard of knocking
only when im casing
a place to rob
amelia said you wanted to see me
hope j bs training is going
as well as yours is
sit
congratulations on making it
to the final six candidates
your test results are even
better than i couldve hoped
come in
eggsy i need to have a
private conversation
youre dismissed
nonsense let him observe
hed learn a thing or two
as you wish take a look at this
fucking hell thats his harry
you blew up his head
its a bit much isnt it
actually the explosion was caused
by an implant in his neck
here under that scar
did my hardware pick up the
signal that triggered it
fortunately yes
unfortunately the ip address
it traced it to is registered
to the valentine corporation
its not much of a lead
they have millions of employees worldwide
no richmond valentine is a genius
did you not see his announcement today
no
we each spend on average
2000 a year on cellphone
and internet usage
it gives me great
pleasure to announce
those days are over
as of tomorrow every man woman and child
can claim a free sim card
compatible with any cellphone
any computer and
utilize my communications network
for free
free calls free internet for everyone
forever
valentines assistant has
the same implant scar
i think mr valentine and i
shall have a têteàtête
hes having a gala dinner next week
ill get you an invitation
you need to be careful though
since you were out hundreds of vips
have gone missing
no ransom notes
exactly like professor arnold
then i suggest you make my alias
somebody worth kidnapping
you dont like heights
yes its okay ive done it before
probably alright if i dont think of it
hey youll be alright
youre top of the class
listen up your mission is to land in the
target without the radar detecting you
if i read you on the radar or
you miss the target you go home
is that understood
drop zone coming up 20 seconds
here we go
i really dont think i can do this
of course you cant
get to the back and ill
show you how yeah
eggsy eggsy wait hang on
roxy just stop fucking about
follow me yeah
roxy its now or never
jump
good girl rox
im glad you made it
my my youre all very cheerful
you really think it was gonna
be that straightforward
any idiot can read a headsup display
a kingsman agent
needs to be able
to solve problems
under pressure
like what to do when one of your group
has no parachute
no parachute who
fuck which one
what do we do
i told you aim for the target
coming under the radar
and i hope not to be
scraping one of you up
but if i do have to and
youre inside the target
means ill be very impressed
everybody listen ive got a plan
pair up grab the closest person to you
rufus come on
oh fuck
rufus
oh shit i cant
fuck
fucking cock
rufus you wanker
we are an odd number now
quick make a circle
fuck right boys lets do it
well pull our cords one by one
when we know whos it the person
on the right grabs him
ok eggsy
good plan eggsy you have 30 seconds
come on now hurry up

ok eggsy
you first okay
yep

rox
hugo digby

then youre not in the k
rufus you opened too soon
you were all over the radar
all three of you pack your bags go home
eggsy roxy congratulations
you have set a new record
opening at 300 feet
thats pretty ballsy
well done on completing another task
follow
sorry sir but why the fuck
you choose me as the gimp
am i the expendable candidate
no no no you dont talk to me like that
if you have a complaint you came here
and you whisper in my ear
you need to take that
jape off your shoulder
mr devere its a pleasure to meet you
i am sorry i seem to
have my dates muddles up
oh no no i canceled the
gala because of you
anybody willing to
donate that much
deserves their own dinner
come in
thank you
gotta admit i was really
intrigued to meet you
there are not many
billionaires i do not know
i dont doubt it
obviously i have had my people
looking into your affairs
and thats some pretty
old money youre from
howd your folks make it
property mostly
property in the markets
nothing personal if thats your concern
no im just in to find out what kind of
person you are im sure you understand that
i most certainly do
hope youre hungry
im famished
good grab a seat
ill have the big mac please
great choice
but nothing beats two cheeseburgers
with secret sauce
tastes great with
this 45 lafite
a classic pairing
may i suggest twinkies with
1937 château dyquem for pudding
i like it
so you want to donate to my foundation
you are aware that i wind
things down in that area right
climate changes affect us all
mr valentine
and you are one of the few powerful people
who seems to share my concerns
i stepped things down because
i wasnt getting anywhere
every bit of research kept
pointing to the same thing
the carbon emissions are a red
herring and we are past the
point of no return no matter
what remedial actions we take
you know your shit
i sometimes envy the blissful
ignorance of those less wellversed
in their shit
as professor arnold always said
humankind is the only virus
cursed to live with the
horrifying knowledge of its
hosts fragile mortality
there are not a lot of
people who know about him
do you like spy movies mr devere
nowadays theyre all a little
serious for my taste
but the old ones marvelous
give me a farfetched
theatrical plot any day
the old bond movies oh man
ah when i was a kid
that was my dream job
a gentleman spy
i always felt the old bond films were
only as good as the villain
as a child i rather fancied
a futuristic colorful megalomaniac
what a shame we both had to grow up
bon appétit
just give me a couple of days
to think over your proposal
ill have my people get in touch with yours
and its all good
thank you for such a happy meal
well you want me to follow him
nah
i put a nano tracker gel in the wine
well know his every move for the next 24
hours finally find out who he works for
valentine didnt let
me out of his sight
all i got was this
on the way in
south glade mission church
is a hate group based in kentucky
the fbi have been
monitoring them for years
do you think valentine
is a supporter
no evidence yet of a direct connection
but ill keep looking
oh by the way
the evergrowing list
of missing persons
now includes scandinavian royalty
royal crown princess tilde
just let me out you psycho
i told you youre free
to go anytime you want
as long as you agree
to my conditions
i dont agree
and i am never ever going to agree
enough yet
bitch
the list of missing celebrities and dignitaries
has continued to grow in recent weeks
and world leaders are coming under
increasing pressure to provide answers
we are doing everything in our
power to find princess tilde
you know governments and security forces
worldwide are working together
to find the person behind these abductions
in other news people all
over the world continue to
wait in line day and night
to get their free sim card
mrs p you get one
yeah ive been queuing up all day
this unprecedented giveaway
by the philanthropist richmond valentine
has already seen over a
billion cards distributed
at ease
so you thought you were
done for the day huh
probably not
a party
tonight in london
who is this
your target
your mission is to use your
nlp training to win over
the individual in the
photograph in your envelope
and when i say win over i
do mean in the biblical sense
easy
most girls love a bit rough
well see about that yeah
who is that anyway
i just had to come over
and say amazing eyes
you wearing color contacts
no
you so are
oh my god negging thats hilarious
i havent had anyone try
that since the 90s
excuse me
negging saying something
negative to a pretty
girl in order to undermine
her social value
its supposed to make you
want to win his approval
absurdly basic neurolinguistic
programming technique
is it just me or does this
champagne taste a little bit funny
thats an acquired taste mate
i think its just cheap
get one of these instead theyre delicious
you know if youre interested in ornamental
techniques this guy is textbook
see what he just did its
called an opinion opener
he got you talking with
a neutral question
got all of us involved in the conversation
so that you crave individual attention
nah im just saying that the
champagne tastes weird
lady sophie montague herring
phone call for you at reception
be right back
see you in a bit yeah
good job rox im feeling a bit rough
you alright
sorry to eavesdrop
but there is a much easier way to
guarantee getting someone home
rohypnol
or even something stronger
who the fuck are you
where am i
this knife can save your life
fuck
my employers got two
questions for you eggsy
what the fuck is kingsman
and who is harry hart
i do not know what the fuck that is
oh eggsy i just killed
two of your friends

is kingsman really worth dying for
no fuck it isnt shit
ill tell all you want please
chester kings arthur
head of a spy agency
its called kingsman
thank you charlie much appreciated
come on it wasnt the fucking deal
i had such high hopes for you
you are a bloody disgrace
im so sorry
please untie me
untie yourself
arthur please
anyoneno
galahad percival congratulations
you candidates have reached the
final stage of the testing process
as tradition allows you now have
24 hours to spend with them
eggsy you should know
your father reached this point
from now on
there are no safety nets
understood
good dismissed
charlie time to go home
fuck you
my fucking dads gonna hear about this
to pee or not to pee
that was the headline the day after i
diffused a dirty bomb in paris
germany 1  england 5
i missed that game
i was breaking up an undercover
spy ring at pentagon
my first mission
i foiled the assassination
of margaret thatcher
not everybody had thanked you for that one
the point is eggsy nobody thanked
me for any of them
front page news and all these occasions
were celebrity nonsense
because it is the nature of kingsman that
our achievements remain secret
a gentlemans name should appear in the
newspaper only three times
when hes born when he
marries and when he dies
and we are first and foremost gentlemen
pretty fucked then
its like charlie said
i am just a pleb
being a gentleman has nothing to do with
the circumstances of ones birth
being a gentleman is something one learns
yeah but how
alright first lesson
you should have asked me
before you took a seat
second lesson
how to make a proper martini
yes harry
goddamn it it fucking hurts
you are the one who asked for
a biometric security system
whats wrong with
a simple switch
a simple switch
this is an extremely
dangerous machine
it should only be operated by someone
responsible and sane as me
bad shit can happen
if it falls into the wrong hands
sync main terminal
are we done here shit
no now this one
for the test of the church
this one just has a short range
a simple switch will do
so you gonna teach me how to talk proper
like in my fair lady
thatd be absurd
being a gentleman has nothing
to do with ones accent
its about being at ease in ones own skin
as hemingway saidthere is nothing noble
in being superior to your fellow man
true nobility is being superior
to your former self
now the first thing every gentleman
needs is a good suit
by which i mean a bespoke suit
never off the peg
and kingsman suits are
always bulletproof
so lets get you measured
and whether you get the job
or not you will have a
lasting and useful memento
of your time at kingsman
im so sorry sir but a gentleman
is completing his fitting
fitting room 2 is available
one does not use
fitting room 2
when one is popping ones cherry
perhaps ill show you fitting
room 3 while we wait
so we going up or down
neither
is this it
of course not pull the hook on your left
oh yes
very very nice
youre going to need a pair of shoes
to go with your suit
an oxford is any formal shoe
with open lacing
this additional decorative
piece is called broguing
oxfords not brogues
words to live by eggsy
words to live by
try a pair
your weapon scores are
excellent by the way
these youre familiar with
and this is our standard issue pistol
its quite unique as you all
see it it also fires a
shotgun cartridge for use in
messy closerange situations
how do they feel now do your
very best in impersonation
of a german aristocrats
formal greeting
no eggsy
that is sick
in the old days they had a
phone in the heel as well
how do i get it back in
it is coated with one
of the fastestacting
neurotoxins known to
man so very carefully
i had a lot of fun with this
one of our finest examples
of chemical engineering
poison harmless when ingested
but at a time
convenient to you
it can be remotely activated
primed
lethal
and what about these what do these do
electrocute you
dont be ridiculous its a hand grenade
shut up
if you want to electrocute someone
youll need a signet ring
a gentleman traditionally wears
the signet on his left hand but
a kingsman wears it on whatever
hand happens to be dominant
if you touch the contact behind the ring
it delivers 50000 volts
and what about them what
makes them so special
nothing that technology is caught up
with the spy world
put it back eggsy
perfect timing gentlemans just finished
mr devere
what a coincidence
youre totally the
reason im here
when you left my house i was searching for
that dopeass smoking jacket you had on
and since im going as royal ascot apparently
you need one of these penguin suits
here i am what are you doing here
whats up man richmond valentine
this is my new valet
i was just introducing him to my tailor
another coincidence so am i
did you have any chance to think further on my proposal
most definitely
my people will be getting in
touch with you very soon
i guarantee it
a word of advice ascot requires top hat
i might suggest lock  co
hatters
st james
lox as in smoked fish
as in locked up
i have trouble understanding
you people sometimes
you all talk so funny
gentlemen would you look after him please
now this is a dopeass top hat
gazelle lets go ascotting
your hat is fine bill come on
dont make me late for the queen
come on gazelle were gonna be late
how far is ascot how far
merlin said you wanted
to see me sir
sit down
pretty dog whats his name
jb
as in james bond
no
jason bourne
no jack bauer
bravo
it pains me to admit it
eggsy but i think that
one day you might be as
good a spy as any of them
take it
shoot the dog
this weapon is live
shoot the dog
give me the gun
at least the girls got balls
get out
i knew you couldnt make it
go home
merlin send in roxy please
welcome to kingsman lancelot
oh god ive been so worried about you
oh my dais look how big youve got
where is he
i am fine
eggsy please please just
dont get involved
no i should never have
left you on your own
this stops right now
be right back
oh mugsy so youre back
you nicked a fucking taxi now
yeah can i have a word about my moms
black eye
you wanna have a word with
me you get out of that cab
ill knock you straight back
down on your fucking arse
tell your muppets to go inside
then ill get out
go on lads therell be two hits
me and him and then he and the floor
come on in you prick
lets see what you got eh
what are you doing
remote car
what are you doing
now youve gone all bollocks
come on hell beat my fucking mother
come back when youve grown a pair mugsy
you throw away
your biggest opportunity
over a fucking dog
and then you humiliate me
by stealing my bosss car
you shot a dog just
to get a fucking job
yes i did
mr pickle here reminds me of that
every time i take a shit
you shot your dog
and had it stuffed
you fucking freak
no i shot my dog and
then i brought him home
and continued to care
for him for the next eleven years
until he died of pancreatitis
what
it was a blank eggsy
it was a fucking blank
remember amelia
yeah
she didnt drown she works in our tech
department in berlin shes fine
limits must be tested a kingsman only condones
the risking of a life to save another
as my father saved your life
even though your fuckup cost his
what youve get him stuffed here also
cant you see that everything i have done
has been about trying to repay him
harry listen to this
valentines alarm is
saying something of note
you know what i love about pen and paper
nobody can hack into this shit
our worldwide tour was a complete success
we have total coverall
like when all your numbers in bingo are crossed out
bingo
bingo the game
you have played bingo right
do i look like i play bingo
point is
if our tests go well at church tomorrow
we are good to go
south glade mission church
merlin get the plane ready
will do
i am so sorry im gonna do
you should be
you stay right there
ill sort this mess out when i get back
kentucky usa
and i say to you bear witness
watch the news watch the news
aids floods
the blood of the innocents spilled
and yet there are those
who doubt this is the wrath of god
our filthy government condones sodomy
divorce abortion
and yet some still doubt
this is the work
of the antichrist
you do not have to be a
jew a nigger a whore
or an atheistic science
loving evolution spouter
charming sermon
can you see valentine anywhere
so my friends although he is a just god
he is justly
the one and there will be no turning back
are you sure we
are out of range
were over a 1000 feet away
whats wrong
what if the calculations are wrong
you just have to trust me
jews nigger fag lovers
and the devil is burning
them for all eternity
excuse me
where are you going
hey whats your problem
i am a catholic whore
currently enjoying congress
out of wedlock with my
black jewish boyfriend
who works in a military abortion clinic
so hail satan and have a
lovely afternoon madam
oh shit hes leaving im
starting the test now
hope enough of these
freaks have our sim cards
ask you to sit down
leave this church like the infidel you are
you will eat your babies
you will drown in the blood of the lord
he will cast
holy fuck
shit i cant watch this get over here
jesus
galahad can you hear me
harry harry what the heck is going on
just turn the volume down please
i didnt expect it to
be that effective
what kind of response
are we talking of
so everyones been infected
whether they have sim card or not
and its added benefit of
wiping out the kingsman
not yet
oh you need to see this
what did you do to me
i had no control
i killed all those people
i wanted to
clever isnt it
in simple terms its a
neurological wave that triggers
the centers of aggression
and switches off inhibitor
transmitted through your nasty
free sim cards i assume
you know what this is like
its like those old movies we both love
now im gonna tell you my whole plan
and then im gonna come up with some
absurd convoluted way to kill you
and then youll find an equally
convoluted way to escape
that sounds good to me
well this aint that kind of movie
no
is he dead
thats usually what happens when
you shoot someone in the head
it feels good right
no no it does not feel good it felt fucking awful
what you just killed how
many people in that church
this is one guy
nono no they killed each other
okay send off the
countdown clock
this party starts tomorrow
arthur
are you there
sadly i am
assemble the kingsman
cant you see that everything i have done
has been about trying to repay him
i see a young man
with potential
who wants to do something
good with his life
kingsman
arthur harry is dead
galahad is dead
hence we have just drunk a toast to him
well then you know what
that psychos doing
how many people in the world
have got those sim cards
valentine can send a signal
to any of them
all of them if they all go homicidal at
the same time then
indeed and thanks to
galahad recordings
we have valentines confession
the intelligence has been passed on to the
relevant authorities
our work is complete
and a most distinguished legacy
for our fallen friend it is too
and thats it
come sit down boy
this is an 1815 napoleonic brandy
and we only drink it
when we lose a kingsman
galahad was very fond of you
and on this occasion i think it is
acceptable for us
to bend the rules a little
these are all kingsmen
yes our founder members
i want you to join me in a toast
to galahad
to galahad
harry said you dont like
to break the rules often
why now
youre very good eggsy
perhaps ill make you my
proposal for galahads position
provided we can see eye to eye
on certain political matters
can you guess
what this is
i dont have to
harry showed it
you click it i die
i thought that brandy tasted a bit shit
bravo
valentine won you over somehow
once he explained i understood
when you get a virus you get a fever
thats the human body raising its
core temperature to kill the virus
planet earth works the same way
global warming is the fever
mankind is the virus
we are making our planet sick
a cull is our only hope
if we do not reduce our
population ourselves
theres only two
ways this can go
the host kills the virus
or the virus kills the host
either way
the result is the same
the virus dies
so valentines gonna take care
of the population problem himself
if we dont do something nature will
sometimes a culling is the only way to
ensure that this species survives
and history will see valentine as the man
who saved humanity from extinction
and he gets to pick and choose
who gets culled does he
all his rich mates they get to live and then when
he thinks its worth saving hes keeping them safe
whether they agree with him or not
and you eggsy
in harrys honor i am inviting you to
be part of a new world
its time to make your decision
i would rather be with harry
thanks
so be it
the problem with us
common types is
that we are light fingered
kingsmans taught me a lot
but slight of hand
yes theyre our our founder members
i had that done already
you dirty little fucking prick
its okay lancelot put it down
its verified
arthurs phones just
received an update text about
getting to safety we
dont have a lot time
what you gonna do
the question is what we gonna do
god knows whos in valentines
pocket and whos not
weve no choice
we are gonna have to deal
with this ourselves
follow me
the fuck is this
i have no idea
what youre playing with
is a prototype personal
transatmospheric vehicle
it was developed as part of
reagans star wars project
its pretty basic but
it should still work
were going to take out one
of valentines satellites
were gonna break the chain
stop the signal
it will take him a couple
of hours to reboot it
which buys us enough time for you to get me
into valentines mainframe
so i can shut it down
lancelot you are going to be using it
get into your halo suit
swedish air force
the swedish prime minister requesting
permission to land
permission granted
please
thank you
so how many more are we expecting
not many most have their own bunkers
i figure were just getting
really nervous once
welcome prime minister
it seems the implant can emit
some kind of counter signal
to ensure the wearer remains unaffected
by the waves from the sim card
the waves that turns everyone
into a psycho killer
quite but what they probably didnt
tell anyone
is that it can also super heat
their soft tissue at his command
valentines selected his chosen few
to get the countdown warning
he had to be sure that it didnt
blow up to the wrong people beforehand
and how does this help us right now
it doesnt roxy here we go
the higher you go
the more the balloons expand
when you reach the edge of the atmosphere
they will explode
you need to deploy your missile
just before that okay
the edge of the atmosphere
and once youve deployed youll need
to release for descent fast
good luck
you can do this okay
eggsy come on
time is not our friend
getting in with arthurs invitation
you gonna need to blend in
im supposed to be arthur
his invitations in his phone
give them this and give
his real name chester king
and what about you
im the pilot im gonna stay here
is that gonna fit me
a bespoke suit always fits
just be grateful harry
had it made for you
get dressed
the fucks wrong with them
i dont know could have something
to do with mass genocide
give me the mic
everybody listen up
what the fuck wrong with you people
i just want to remind you that today
is a day of celebration
we must put aside
all thoughts of death
and focus on birth
the birth of a new age
we mustnt mourn those who
give their lives today
we should honor their sacrifice
she got my number to call me back
and their role in saving
the human race
we must put aside doubts and guilts
you are the chosen people
when folks tell their kids the story
of noahs ark is noah the bad guy
is god the bad guy
how about the animals marching two by two
of course not
yes thats it so lets turn
that frown upside down
eat drink and party
and ill see you all in the new age
rox its me hows the view
hideous
mines pretty sweet

look forward to then
