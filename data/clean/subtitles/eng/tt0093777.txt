but he never regained consciousness
why was he here
he had an appointment with
his eminence this afternoon
lets talk about
our beliefs
and what we can
learn about them
we believe nature is solid
and time a constant
matter has substance
and time a direction
there is truth in flesh
huh
and the solid ground
the wind may be invisible
but its real
smoke fire water light
theyre different
not as to stone nor steel
but theyre tangible
and we assume time
has an arrow
because it is as a clock
one second is
one second for everyone
cause precedes effect
fruit rots
water flows downstream
were born we age we die
the reverse never happens
none of this is true
say goodbye to classical reality
because our logic collapses
on the subatomic level
into ghosts and shadows
from jobs friends insisting
that the good are rewarded
and the wicked punished
to the scientists of the 1930s
proving to their horror a theorem
that not everything can be proved
weve sought to impose
order on the universe
but we have discovered
something very surprising
while order does exist in the universe
it is not at all what we had in mind
professor birack in relativity
geometry breaks down on the cosmic
scale and in quantum physics
logic breaks down
on the submicroscopic scale
whats this
i dont know
birack did that whole series of
debates on the bbc a few years ago
oh with the english priest
right
maybe theyre planning
another one
he died before his appointment
with the cardinal
but he left a diary
youyou must help us
please
the discovery of this supernova
has immense significance
to the scientific community
particles collected date
from precambrian times
before man walked on earth
light from the explosion
was hurled through space
at 186000 miles per second
and is just now reaching us
across the vast expanse of the universe
he was the guardian priest
apparently he lived here
for over 30 years
once a week
he would venture out for food
and every day
he opened this door
built in the 1500s
by arrangement
with the spanish government
who knew about this only the
members of this forgotten sect
the brotherhood of sleep
there was a vow of silence
even their very existence
was kept from the holy see
the vatican didnt know
the guardian priest
would keep the secret
and before he died
would pass it on to another
the sect had enormous
power and authority
their actions were never questioned
latin
some of it is in latin
some in coptic greek numbers
its not easy to decipher
the original text has been
distorted over the years
distorted
rewritten
writing upon writing
sometimes two or three times
and improperly erased
you can still see
the old writing
its underneath
what is it
a secret that can no longer be kept
do you feel it
yes something
it was never here before
it started a month ago
what started
a change in the earth
and the sky
his power
i dont get it
what dont you get
the whole thing
it doesnt make sense
it violates common sense thats the whole
point thats what einstein couldnt accept
i cant accept it either do you know
anything about spontaneous human combustion
walter come on thats
schrodingers cat i know i know
so whats the point the point is
until the cat is observed by someone
hes not in any definite state
either alive or dead
hes in a wave superposition state
both dead and alive at the same time
huh
okay
only when we open the box
and observe the cat
does he materialize into reality
either dead or alive
but it doesnt make sense that
is the entire complete point
it doesnt make
any common sense
our common sense breaks down
on a subatomic level
why do i want a ph d in this
particle beam weapons
research grants
a millionaire when im 40
now i remember
youre really gonna like this
class canceled
will the following students
please see professor birack
shit there i am
me too
all of us and we heard birack wants
us to cancel our plans for the weekend
what thats not all a couple of
biochemistrys finest are coming with us
and someone to translate latin
coming with us where
im gonna have to pull some strings here this is just
not gonna happen i have serious plans for the weekend
400 walter biracks office oh i gotta
ditch pagels again hes not gonna like it
sleep with him
get an a
so what about your plans
i was gonna study actually
me too
im brian marsh by the way
since were spending
the weekend together
i know
catherine danforth
i know
so where did you
transfer from
kneale
theoretical physics
i came here to study with birack
youre applied physics right
so why are you taking
birack for theory
i wanna know
what the math means
biracks ruthless
he wants philosophers not scientists
well ive read his books
hes a brilliant man
just when i think ive got it
visualized it it just all goes away
i start seeing
oldfashioned classical reality again
i want the clock put back
i wanna put it all into a little box
but whenever i try
it just uh slithers out
some things arent changed
by quantum physics though
such as
well for instance
every theoretical physicist
i know wonders why it is
that no one who looks like you
ever seems to settle down
in our end of the building
thats not true and thats
an extremely sexist thing to say
confirmed sexist
and proud of it
hey i was just joking
what happened
you talk numbers you get romantic
you talk people you clam up
just a little miscue thats all
its not your fault
im sorry
ill see you later
hey wait
this conversation isnt what i
had in mind can we start over
okay
okay
i was hoping that you would need
some help with your theory
and that maybe we could discuss it
over over dinner or something
well i suppose
something could be arranged
there are other things
that i need help with over dinner
i have volunteered our services
to the archdiocese
now each of you
is a competent physicist
even though you dont have
a degree to prove it
participating in this examination
will greatly improve your
classroom averages i might add
plan to take your meals there
well bring cots to sleep on
there are other departments joining us
excuse me sir
is there some reason why youre not
telling us what were gonna be doing
in time
its your disbelief that powers him
your stubborn faith in
in common sense
that allows his deception
he lives in
the smallest parts of it
in the atoms
smaller
invisible
he lives in all of it
in the sum of its parts
we must translate
this book
you must prove it
scientifically
convince the outside world
the outside world doesnt want
to hear this kind of bullshit
just keep it locked away
youve already managed that
for 2000 years
no prison can hold him now
hi
hi
its getting cold out here i thought
this was supposed to be california
did you have a class tonight or
library
oh actually i was hoping youd
have a cup of coffee with me again
this is startin
to become a habit
okay
okay
good morning
thank you
we didnt get much sleep
mmm
who needs sleep
we do todays friday
can i tell you something
oh please dont
i want to
tell me next time
if there is one
or the time after that or
two years from now
who was he
the one who gave you
such a high opinion of men
i wouldnt like it if
either of us jumped to conclusions
how do you know i was going to say
what you think i was gonna say
because if you dont
i dont wanna know
oh please dont tell me
this place gives me the creeps
well it was abandoned
hmm i never wouldve guessed
no i hear it used to be
a beautiful church when
in the 1950s my husbands
parents used to come here
and then for some reason
it was closed down
well
yeah
hi im uh leahy
im looking for birack
hi brian marsh
hes over in there he is
ah thanks
professor birack
yes
hi im paul leahy
oh dr leahy
im glad you could come yes well now all
i really know about whats goin on here
is what one of your students
told me on the telephone
were just getting organized if you have
some equipment find a spot over there
all right
were making this the central lab
sure well what are we
actually doing here
well i gotta cover for leahy over
the weekend extra credit seminar wow
hi frank
dont leave
excuse me
i have to set up
hi
hello
frankie whos that
susan cabot
radiologist married
ah how married
very
oh hi doc
hi ill be workin upstairs
i want you to set up the
basic panel down here right
what are you supposed
to be testing
i dont know
compounds basic structures
when i know youll know
uh leahy
great
science marches on
yeah
need any help
no im okay
there better be a diploma in my
mailbox when i get home on monday
i really cant believe this is
happening i had a date tonight
with this beautiful young
trial attorney from century city
where were you taking him
please it isnt funny
what are they doing
theyre watching us
they started comin around when
i got here at 900 this morning
im calder microbiology
brian marsh
walter
lomax engineering
nice meeting you
hi
lomax
how you doing
so anybody know what
this whole deals about yet
not a clue
nobodys got a clue
im getting my doctorate
in theology
analysis of ancient scriptures
this shouldnt be too difficult
except for the numbers
its so wonderful
what youre doing father
opening the church again
are you all right
were ready
hes gaining strength
i can feel it all around us now
so whats going on
something downstairs
yeah what
i hate to tell you guys
but this is real bullshit
i know theres a reason why
nobodys opened this thing yet right
let me have your pen
for a second
is this some kind of
toxic crap could be
okay but i still dont understand
why were not taking direct samples
i mean whats the big mystery
catherines entering these equations
upstairs theyre translated from latin
differential equations
from a book written
2000 years ago
we hadnt invented
differential equations right
professor birack i dont think
we have too much to worry about
the lid on that thing wont open
look
its incredibly elaborate
right here theres a
theres a weird locking mechanism
looks like it can only
be opened from the inside
im going back
look at this
now a friend of mine at ucla
did a study of chronic schizophrenics
theyre supposed to have stereotyped routines
that they repeat every 20 minutes or so
you know like a stuck record in their brains
repeating the same phrase over and over
well i have been watching them
on and off all day
and they dont seem
to be making any movements
they just stand there
with those kinds of problems
i say let em stand there
if they want to ooh
you okay
yeah i bumped into something
this afternoon
its starting to hurt
probably nerves
its a bruise walter
you dont bruise from nerves
i used to break out when i was 12
doctor said it was homosexual panic
ill see you monday morning
you got anything for me
no im afraid not im guessing on the
acidity based upon the corrosion samples
the figures you gave me
yeah
well it cant be that high well
i know but you asked me to guess
all right get outta here
good night sir
hey whats with the sir business
okay good night sir doc
better
a lot better
my god
hey look can i talk
to you for a minute yes
nobodys really saying
much of anything here
were still putting together the first round of
tests and nobodys really stopped since we got here
get to the point
nothing anywhere ever is supposed
to be able to do what it is doing
now settle down now
go back to work a life form is
growing out of prebiotic fluid
its not winding down into disorder
its selforganizing
its becoming something
what
i mean an animal
a disease what
the hardest thing to hear for any of
us is something we dont agree with
i saw a star fall from heaven
unto the bottomless pit
and he was cast out
as water from the flood
this is crazy
man
hadnt you seen it yet
no for the last four hours ive been
carbon dating the corrosion on the lid there
were talking about
seven million years
what
yeah
im goin topside
want me to wait for you
no uhuh go on
this whole sections a kind of history
part of it was indecipherable
as if someone were deliberately
trying to erase it
i managed to piece together most of it
okay it kind of starts here
the container was buried somewhere
in the middle east eons ago by
it gets a little wild here
the father of satan
a god who once walked the earth
before man
but was somehow banished
to the dark side
apparently the father
buried his son inside the container
this was the section
someone was trying to erase
now later on here
christ comes to warn us
he was of extraterrestrial ancestry
but a humanlike race
finally they determine christ is crazy
but hes also gaining power converting a lot
of people to his beliefs so they kill him
but his disciples keep the secret
and hide it from civilization
until man could develop a science sophisticated
enough to prove what christ was saying
something like this can really
fuck up your weekend
how did the roman catholic church manage
to keep this a secret for 2000 years
apparently a decision was made
to characterize pure evil
as a spiritual force
even within the darkness
in the hearts of men
it was more convenient
in that way man remained
at the center of things
a stupid lie
we were salesmen thats all
we sold our product
to those who didnt have it
the new life
reward ourselves
punish our enemies
so we can live without truth
a substance
malevolence
that was the truth
asleep
until now
help me break this up
the others shouldnt hear this
faith is a hard thing to come
by these days look at this
that thing down therejust directed
a fairly sizable burst of energy
directed
in a straight line with the precision
of less than a millisecond
everybodys acting like we should
really be taking this seriously
you two arent taking
this seriously are you
what are we supposed to do
just go back to work
what would you rather have
a wreath of garlic
a benediction
a crucifix
then it really is old scratch
knocking at the door
a few minutes ago a vibration was triggered
in the metal on that thing downstairs
a strong one
some kind of
kinetic emission came out of it
now if it can transmit
a signal strong enough
it can move other objects
instantaneously across a distance
without outside intervention
psychokinesis
minddirected energy
dont tell the others yet
why not
they have a right to know that this
that it its conscious
not until you prove
it wasnt something else
a power surge or a draft of air
all right
you missed the big history lesson
youre not gonna believe
whats been going on up here
want one
anyone ever tell you that
you could pass for asian
whew
what was that all about
no sense of humor
have you seen susan
who
radiologist glasses
oh yeah shes right outside
where
she was there i think
somebody oughta tell her
look am i crazy or are we
stroking ourselves heavily here
thank you for taking the time
to share your thoughts
susan
theres more to it
theres some kind of power
directed outward
a controlled force
whats it doing
reaching out
influencing
changing things
moving objects by thought
extraordinary intervention
intelligent cause other than man
susan
hello
suppose
what your faith has said
was essentially correct
suppose there is a universal mind
controlling everything
a god willing the behavior
of every subatomic particle
now every particle
has an antiparticle
its mirror image
its negative side
maybe this universal mind
resides in the mirror image
instead of in our universe
as we wanted to believe
maybe hes antigod
bringing darkness instead of light
why werent we told the truth
without the technology to confirm
it would have been another legend
but he was our prisoner not yours
we had a responsibility
to warn the rest of the world
only the corrupt
are listened to now
and they tell us
what we want to hear
we believe it to be divine light
it just got colder in here
i know
suddenly as if
as if something
moved through the room
listen do you realize
whats going on up there
we are on the brink
of the ultimate truth
oh this priest is a real case
he is looney tunes and im
beginning to wonder about birack too
im going back
come on calder
come on frank
youre outta your minds
this is a joke this is caca
come on
caca
hello
wheres wyndham
uh he left
when
oh about 20 minutes ago
we tried to talk him out of it
but uh
has anyone seen susan
who
the radiologist glasses
well maybe she left too
maybe they both had
the right idea
this is not a dream
not a dream
we are using your brains
electrical system as a receiver
we are unable to transmit
through conscious neurointerference
you are receiving
this broadcast as a dream
we are transmitting from the year 19
walter
what
have you seen mullins
what no
susan
who
radiologist glasses
come on man
i was asleep
we cant find them
and wyndhams left
couple of the others are talking about leaving
were gonna have a meeting in the lab in half an hour
mullins left
i dont know
im gonna go downstairs
and look for him
well since im up now
if i dont come back
you can have my porsche
you are receiving this broadcast in order
to alter the events you are seeing
our technology has not developed
a transmitter strong enough
to reach your conscious
and your awareness
what were you dreaming
your kingdom father does
not include my unconscious
its mine and i may abuse it
any way i wish
without having to confess
whats in it
something i havent
told you
the brotherhood of sleep
anyone in close proximity
has the same dream
the one you had
just now
um
excuse me but i
the guardian priests had
the dream for years
what does it mean
a premonition
the dream evolves
unfolds
we shall start to have it
every time we go to sleep
as if its pushing
everything else out
making room for itself
mullins
do you think he really
just took off
i mean like he was actually
believing this whole business
why is everybody
looking at me that way
cause youre being assholeish thats
very assholeish of you to say so
look mullins is probably
off asleep someplace
or hes boffing
the radiologist
i hope hes getting laid i hope theyre both
on their way to a nice chinese restaurant
how can you keep
working like this
its 330
no wonder im so tired
i keep getting these figures
in the computer
but theyre not
making any sense
i stopped making sense
about 15 minutes ago
no i mean these equations
are beyond me now
theyre like another language mmm
go get some sleep
ill wake you in half an hour
oh 45 minutes
okay
hey are you okay
no
i know what you mean
i just want to go home pretend
none of this is really happening
whats that
hmm
oh its just a bruise
i got somehow
finally stopped hurting
this looks like a figure
of some kind
no i got to close my eyes okay
ill wake you
thanks
hello
im opening the door if you want to stop
what youre doing and put your clothes on
big doings in the lab tonight
theres a meeting
oh give me just 15 minutes
you want me to come back
later
any luck
cant find anybody
im going up to the lab
ill be there in a minute
were having a meeting
in the lab
lisa
mona lisa
lisa
this whole building is gonna
have to be encased in concrete
no way a building this size i
say we launch the fucker into space
im hearing something
where are the others
we think theyve left
kellys asleep i didnt
want to wake her up
im asking you to stay
the work that we do in the
next 48 hours is critical
how many of you have fallen
asleep tonight please tell me
come on please
you dreamed you dreamed about
the front of this church
about a dark figure coming out
didnt you
didnt you feel it
not like a dream
like something else
here
i had the dream too
this image of something that didnt
seem to belong to my subconscious
almost if i was watching
something prerecorded
tachyons
one possibility
whats that
its a greek word
it means swift one
so what is the dream
huh precognition
previous knowledge
of a future event
a shared vision of something
that is yet to occur
caused by that thing
downstairs perhaps not
tachyon is a subatomic particle
that travels faster than light
supposing it isnt a dream
supposing its a message
what if these dreams
premonitions omens
what if theyre really
visual messages sent
by other human beings
photographs
video signals
from where
the future
anything traveling faster
than the speed of light
would appear to be
going backward in time
a future scientist calculates
the exact spot
that the earth occupied
in space in the past
given trajectory and speed
he then beams
a tachyon signal
at that spot
transmitting video information
backwards through time
for us to receive as electrical
impulses neural stimulus
man oh man
for what purpose
could be a warning
to show us
whats going to happen
a sort of
remote camera view
of the future
so that we can change it
someone has finally
shown up to tell us
i think its time we stood up
for what we are
i think theres something wrong with
this im not getting anything now
its gone dead
maybe the generators dead no it looks
more like the units downstairs were cut off
hello hello
hey wyndham
hello hello
come here
look at this
ive got a message for you
and youre not
going to like it
look at his chest
pray for death
jesus christ
calder
no calder
no no
oh
no
kelly
aah
hey hey you guys
they got the back doors
blocked away there
what the hells
happening here
the back doors are locked
you okay
check the windows
whats going on here
we cant get out
its in here
dont come in here
go go go
lock the door
come on
get over here
the suns coming up
normally i love
being dominated by women
lisa im sorry about
what i said before
you dont look asian
at all
shit
i thought i heard walter
walter walter
what the fuck do you want
where are you
if i told you
you wouldnt believe me
hey can you dig through
and get me out of here
i dont know the walls
pretty thick are you all right
well thats a relative
thing right now but yeah
wait a second
theyre just standing there
outside
not trying to get in theyve
stopped attacking for some reason
walter where are you
exactly
im in this closet
i think we can
get through with this
its gonna take a while
walter were gonna
try and dig through
how long will it take
a couple ofhours
oh great ill tell you what
ill hang out here anyway
well get ready
to pull me back
come on brian come here
come on brian
come on lets go
now
come on come up here
come on man hurry up
come on come on brian
come on come on brian
come on
come on
you guys seen
any movies you like
all right
ajewish mother goes to the airport
to meet her daughter
the daughter steps off the plane
with an eightfoottall zulu warrior
with a bone through his nose
the mother screams
you fool
i said a rich doctor
not a dream
we are using your brains
electrical system as a receiver
we are unable to transmit
through conscious neurointerference
you are receiving this broadcast
as a dream
we are transmitting
from the year 199
we can try the hallway
after it gets dark
if i can make my way up front i could
break some windows call for help
no one out there
can help us
the other morning you said that
you had something to tell me
and you probably
think that none of that
matters now
but youre wrong
its the only thing
that does
worker ants driven
to a higher purpose
unknown
to the individual
street people
our colleagues
all controlled
demonic possession
of a kind
not what we would
expect though never that
why would he need us
the book says his purpose
is to bring the father
back from the dark side
wherever that is
there could be a limit as to
what he could do you know
as a volume of liquid
he controls simple
organisms easily
but maybe he needs something more
complex to complete a life cycle
a host in which to live
hello hello
walter
its kelly shes changing again
the swellings gone down as if the
liquid was absorbed into her system
i can see tissue changes
on her face
also i think
her bone structure is changing
maybe this is the only way
he could actualize his power
a parasite
growing into its host
this could be
some kind of gestation period
i know id seen it before
kelly had a mark it was a
bruise almost like a figure
i saw it in a history book
the astrologers staff
used in ritual magic
in the middle ages
the mark was on her
yes
as if she were chosen
walter
what
keep watching her closely
anything that you see tell us
i have to go
to the bathroom
god and father
of our lord
jesus christ
i appeal to your
holy name
humbly begging that you
will grant us help
against this
unclean
spirit
thou
tormenteth these creatures
of hell
through jesus christ
our lord
look down
upon these thy servants
caught in the coils of
where are you
christ
where are you
holy shit
get me the hell out ofhere
help me help me get out ofhere
theyre gonna kill me
i dont want to die
help me help
help me
behind the door behind
the door you cant brian
oh god help
help me oh
hey
aah
come on
its not working
father
father
i could
i could
unclean spirit
father
come to freedom
no
we stopped it
we stopped it here
through the grace of god
i stopped it
the future conjured up by the
that vile serpent
will not happen now
the smaller parts
could not live
without the strength
of the whole
they had to die
to fade away
as the whole was thrown
back and repelled
were safe
but hes waiting
on the other side
she died for us
