but he never regained consciousness 
why was he here 
he had an appointment with
his eminence this afternoon 
let s talk about
our beliefs   
and what we can
learn about them 
we believe nature is solid   
and time a constant 
matter has substance 
and time a direction 
there is truth in flesh 
huh 
and the solid ground 
the wind may be invisible 
but it s real 
smoke  fire  water  light   
they re different 
not as to stone nor steel 
but they re tangible 
and we assume time
has an arrow 
because it is as a clock 
one second is
one second for everyone 
cause precedes effect 
fruit rots 
water flows downstream 
we re born  we age  we die 
the reverse never happens 
none of this is true 
say good bye to classical reality 
because our logic collapses
on the subatomic level   
into ghosts and shadows 
from job s friends insisting   
that the good are rewarded
and the wicked punished   
to the scientists of the 1930s   
proving to their horror a theorem   
that not everything can be proved 
we ve sought to impose
order on the universe 
but we have discovered
something very surprising 
while order does exist in the universe 
it is not at all what we had in mind 
professor birack  in relativity   
geometry breaks down on the cosmic
scale  and in quantum physics   
logic breaks down
on the sub microscopic scale 
what s this 
i don t know 
birack did that whole series of
debates on the b b c  a few years ago 
oh  with the english priest 
right 
maybe they re planning
another one 
he died before his appointment
with the cardinal 
but he left a diary 
you you must help us 
please 
the discovery of this supernova   
has immense significance
to the scientific community 
particles collected date
from pre cambrian times   
before man walked on earth 
light from the explosion
was hurled through space   
at 186 000 miles per second 
and is just now reaching us
across the vast expanse of the universe 
he was the guardian priest 
apparently  he lived here
for over 30 years 
once a week 
he would venture out for food 
and every day 
he opened this door 
built in the 1500s   
by arrangement
with the spanish government 
who knew about this  only the
members of this forgotten sect 
the brotherhood of sleep 
there was a vow of silence 
even their very existence
was kept from the holy see 
the vatican didn t know 
the guardian priest
would keep the secret 
and before he died
would pass it on to another 
the sect had enormous
power and authority 
their actions were never questioned 
latin 
some of it is in latin 
some in coptic  greek  numbers 
it s not easy to decipher 
the original text has been
distorted over the years 
distorted 
rewritten 
writing upon writing 
sometimes two or three times 
and improperly erased 
you can still see
the old writing 
it s underneath 
what is it 
a secret that can no longer be kept 
do you feel it 
yes  something 
it was never here before 
it started a month ago 
what started 
a change in the earth   
and the sky 
his power 
i don t get it 
what don t you get 
the whole thing 
it doesn t make sense 
it violates common sense  that s the whole
point  that s what einstein couldn t accept 
i can t accept it either  do you know
anything about spontaneous human combustion 
walter  come on  that s
schrodinger s cat  i know  i know 
so what s the point  the point is 
until the cat is observed by someone 
he s not in any definite state 
either alive or dead 
he s in a wave superposition state 
both dead and alive at the same time 
huh 
okay 
only when we open the box
and observe the cat   
does he materialize into reality 
either dead or alive 
but it doesn t make sense  that
is the entire  complete point 
it doesn t make
any common sense 
our common sense breaks down
on a subatomic level 
why do i want a ph  d in this 
particle beam weapons 
research grants 
a millionaire when i m 40 
now i remember 
you re really gonna like this 
class canceled 
 will the following students
please see professor birack   
shit  there i am 
me too 
all of us  and we heard birack wants
us to cancel our plans for the weekend 
what  that s not all  a couple of
biochemistry s finest are coming with us 
and someone to translate latin 
coming with us where 
i m gonna have to pull some strings here  this is just
not gonna happen  i have serious plans for the weekend 
4 00  walter  birack s office  oh  i gotta
ditch pagels again  he s not gonna like it 
sleep with him 
get an  a  
so what about your plans 
i was gonna study  actually 
me too 
i m brian marsh  by the way 
since we re spending
the weekend together 
i know 
catherine danforth 
i know 
so where did you
transfer from 
kneale 
theoretical physics 
i came here to study with birack 
you re applied physics  right 
so why are you taking
birack for theory 
i wanna know
what the math means 
birack s ruthless 
he wants philosophers  not scientists 
well  i ve read his books 
he s a brilliant man 
just when i think i ve got it 
visualized it  it just all goes away 
i start seeing
old fashioned classical reality again 
i want the clock put back 
i wanna put it all into a little box 
but whenever i try 
it just  uh  slithers out 
some things aren t changed
by quantum physics though 
such as 
well  for instance 
every theoretical physicist
i know wonders why it is   
that no one who looks like you   
ever seems to settle down
in our end of the building 
that s not true  and that s
an extremely sexist thing to say 
confirmed sexist 
and proud of it 
hey  i was just joking 
what happened 
you talk numbers  you get romantic 
you talk people  you clam up 
just a little miscue  that s all 
it s not your fault 
i m sorry 
i ll see you later 
hey  wait 
this conversation isn t what i
had in mind  can we start over 
okay 
okay 
i was hoping that you would need
some help with your theory 
and that maybe we could discuss it   
over    over dinner or something 
well  i suppose
something could be arranged 
there are other things
that i need help with    over dinner 
i have volunteered our services
to the archdiocese 
now  each of you
is a competent physicist 
even though you don t have
a degree to prove it 
participating in this examination   
will greatly improve your
classroom averages  i might add 
plan to take your meals there 
we ll bring cots to sleep on 
there are other departments joining us 
excuse me  sir 
is there some reason why you re not
telling us what we re gonna be doing 
in time 
it s your disbelief that powers him 
your stubborn faith in   
in common sense   
that allows his deception 
he lives in
the smallest parts of it   
in the atoms 
smaller 
invisible 
he lives in all of it   
in the sum of its parts 
we must translate
this book 
you must prove it
scientifically 
convince the outside world 
the outside world doesn t want
to hear this kind of bullshit 
just keep it locked away 
you ve already managed that
for 2 000 years 
no prison can hold him now 
hi 
hi 
it s getting cold out here  i thought
this was supposed to be california 
did you have a class tonight  or   
library 
oh  actually  i was hoping you d
have a cup of coffee with me again 
this is startin 
to become a habit 
okay 
okay 
good morning 
thank you 
we didn t get much sleep 
mmm 
who needs sleep 
we do  today s friday 
can i tell you something 
oh  please  don t 
i want to 
tell me next time   
if there is one 
or the time after that  or   
two years from now 
who was he 
the one who gave you
such a high opinion of men 
i wouldn t like it if
either of us jumped to conclusions 
how do you know i was going to say
what you think i was gonna say 
because if you don t 
i don t wanna know 
oh  please  don t tell me 
this place gives me the creeps 
well  it was abandoned 
hmm  i never would ve guessed 
no  i hear it used to be
a beautiful church  when 
in the 1950s  my husband s
parents used to come here 
and then for some reason 
it was closed down 
well 
yeah 
hi  i m  uh  leahy 
i m looking for birack 
hi  brian marsh 
he s over in    there he is 
ah  thanks 
professor birack 
yes 
hi  i m paul leahy 
oh  dr  leahy 
i m glad you could come  yes  well  now  all
i really know about what s goin  on here   
is what one of your students
told me on the telephone 
we re just getting organized  if you have
some equipment  find a spot over there 
all right 
we re making this the central lab 
sure  well  what are we
actually doing here 
well  i gotta cover for leahy over
the weekend  extra credit seminar  wow 
hi  frank 
don t leave 
excuse me 
i have to set up 
hi 
hello 
frankie  who s that 
susan cabot 
radiologist  married 
ah  how married 
very 
oh  hi  doc 
hi  i ll be workin  upstairs 
i want you to set up the
basic panel down here  right 
what are you supposed
to be testing 
i don t know 
compounds  basic structures 
when i know  you ll know 
uh  leahy 
great 
science marches on 
yeah 
need any help 
no  i m okay 
there better be a diploma in my
mailbox when i get home on monday 
i really can t believe this is
happening  i had a date tonight   
with this beautiful young
trial attorney from century city 
where were you taking him 
please  it isn t funny 
what are they doing 
they re watching us 
they started comin  around when
i got here at 9 00 this morning 
i m calder  microbiology 
brian marsh 
walter 
lomax  engineering 
nice meeting you 
hi 
lomax 
how you doing 
so anybody know what
this whole deal s about yet 
not a clue 
nobody s got a clue 
i m getting my doctorate
in theology 
analysis of ancient scriptures 
this shouldn t be too difficult 
except for the numbers 
it s so wonderful
what you re doing  father 
opening the church again 
are you all right 
we re ready 
he s gaining strength 
i can feel it all around us now 
so what s going on 
something downstairs 
yeah  what 
i hate to tell you guys 
but this is real bullshit 
i know there s a reason why
nobody s opened this thing yet  right 
let me have your pen
for a second 
is this some kind of
toxic crap  could be 
okay  but i still don t understand
why we re not taking direct samples 
i mean  what s the big mystery 
catherine s entering these equations
upstairs  they re translated from latin 
differential equations 
from a book written
2 000 years ago 
we hadn t invented
differential equations    right 
professor birack  i don t think
we have too much to worry about 
the lid on that thing won t open 
look 
it s incredibly elaborate 
right here  there s a   
there s a weird locking mechanism 
looks like it can only
be opened from the inside 
i m going back 
look at this 
now  a friend of mine at u c l a 
did a study of chronic schizophrenics 
they re supposed to have stereotyped routines
that they repeat every 20 minutes or so 
you know  like a stuck record in their brains
repeating the same phrase over and over 
well  i have been watching them
on and off all day 
and they don t seem
to be making any movements 
they just stand there 
with those kinds of problems 
i say let  em stand there
if they want to  ooh 
you okay 
yeah  i bumped into something
this afternoon 
it s starting to hurt 
probably nerves 
it s a bruise  walter 
you don t bruise from nerves 
i used to break out when i was 12 
doctor said it was homosexual panic 
i ll see you monday morning 
you got anything for me 
no  i m afraid not  i m guessing on the
acidity based upon the corrosion samples 
the figures you gave me 
yeah 
well  it can t be that high  well 
i know  but you asked me to guess 
all right  get outta here 
good night  sir 
hey  what s with the  sir  business 
okay  good night  sir doc 
better 
a lot better 
my god 
hey  look  can i talk
to you for a minute  yes 
nobody s really saying
much of anything here 
we re still putting together the first round of
tests  and nobody s really stopped since we got here 
get to the point 
nothing    anywhere ever is supposed
to be able to do what it is doing 
now  settle down now 
go back to work  a life form is
growing out of pre biotic fluid 
it s not winding down into disorder 
it s self organizing 
it s becoming something 
what 
i mean  an animal 
a disease  what 
the hardest thing to hear for any of
us is something we don t agree with 
 i saw a star fall from heaven
unto the bottomless pit 
and he was cast out
as water from the flood     
this is crazy 
man 
hadn t you seen it yet 
no  for the last four hours  i ve been
carbon dating the corrosion on the lid there 
we re talking about
seven million years 
what 
yeah 
i m goin  topside 
want me to wait for you 
no  uh uh  go on 
this whole section s a kind of history 
part of it was indecipherable 
as if someone were deliberately
trying to erase it 
i managed to piece together most of it 
okay  it kind of starts here 
 the container was buried somewhere
in the middle east eons ago by     
it gets a little wild here   
 the father of satan 
 a god who once walked the earth
before man   
but was somehow banished
to the dark side   
apparently  the father
buried his son inside the container 
this was the section
someone was trying to erase 
now later on here 
 christ comes to warn us 
he was of extraterrestrial ancestry 
but a human like race   
finally  they determine christ is crazy 
but he s also gaining power converting a lot
of people to his beliefs  so they kill him 
but his disciples keep the secret
and hide it from civilization   
until man could develop a science sophisticated
enough to prove what christ was saying 
something like this can really
fuck up your weekend 
how did the roman catholic church manage
to keep this a secret for 2 000 years 
apparently  a decision was made   
to characterize pure evil
as a spiritual force 
even within the darkness
in the hearts of men 
it was more convenient 
in that way  man remained
at the center of things 
a stupid lie 
we were salesmen  that s all 
we sold our product   
to those who didn t have it 
the new life 
reward ourselves 
punish our enemies   
so we can live without truth 
a substance 
malevolence 
that was the truth 
asleep   
until now 
help me break this up 
the others shouldn t hear this 
faith is a hard thing to come
by these days  look at this 
that thing down therejust directed
a fairly sizable burst of energy 
directed 
in a straight line    with the precision
of less than a millisecond 
everybody s acting like we should
really be taking this seriously 
you two aren t taking
this seriously  are you 
what are we supposed to do 
just go back to work 
what would you rather have 
a wreath of garlic 
a benediction 
a crucifix 
then it really is old scratch
knocking at the door 
a few minutes ago  a vibration was triggered
in the metal on that thing downstairs 
a strong one 
some kind of   
kinetic emission came out of it 
now  if it can transmit
a signal strong enough   
it can move other objects   
instantaneously across a distance   
without outside intervention 
psychokinesis 
mind directed energy 
don t tell the others yet 
why not 
they have a right to know that this   
that it    it s conscious 
not until you prove
it wasn t something else   
a power surge or a draft of air 
all right 
you missed the big history lesson 
you re not gonna believe
what s been going on up here 
want one 
anyone ever tell you that
you could pass for asian 
whew 
what was that all about 
no sense of humor 
have you seen susan 
who 
radiologist  glasses 
oh  yeah  she s right outside 
where 
she was there  i think
somebody oughta tell her 
look  am i crazy  or are we
stroking ourselves heavily here 
thank you for taking the time
to share your thoughts 
susan 
there s more to it 
there s some kind of power   
directed outward 
a controlled force 
what s it doing 
reaching out 
influencing 
changing things 
moving objects by thought 
extraordinary intervention 
intelligent cause other than man 
susan 
hello 
suppose   
what your faith has said
was essentially correct 
suppose there is a universal mind
controlling everything 
a god willing the behavior
of every subatomic particle 
now  every particle
has an anti particle 
its mirror image 
its negative side 
maybe this universal mind   
resides in the mirror image
instead of in our universe   
as we wanted to believe 
maybe he s anti god 
bringing darkness instead of light 
why weren t we told the truth 
without the technology to confirm 
it would have been another legend 
but he was our prisoner  not yours 
we had a responsibility   
to warn the rest of the world 
only the corrupt
are listened to now 
and they tell us
what we want to hear 
we believe it to be divine light 
it just got colder in here 
i know 
suddenly  as if   
as if something   
moved through the room 
listen  do you realize
what s going on up there 
we are on the brink
of the ultimate truth 
oh  this priest is a real case 
he is looney tunes  and i m
beginning to wonder about birack too 
i m going back 
come on  calder 
come on  frank 
you re outta your minds 
this is a joke  this is caca 
come on 
caca 
hello 
where s wyndham 
uh  he left 
when 
oh  about 20 minutes ago 
we tried to talk him out of it 
but  uh   
has anyone seen susan 
who 
the radiologist  glasses 
well  maybe she left too 
maybe they both had
the right idea 
this is not a dream 
not a dream 
we are using your brain s
electrical system as a receiver 
we are unable to transmit
through conscious neuro interference 
you are receiving
this broadcast as a dream 
we are transmitting from the year 1 9   
walter 
what 
have you seen mullins 
what  no 
susan 
who 
radiologist  glasses 
come on  man 
i was asleep 
we can t find them 
and wyndham s left 
couple of the others are talking about leaving 
we re gonna have a meeting in the lab in half an hour 
mullins left 
i don t know 
i m gonna go downstairs
and look for him 
well  since i m up now 
if i don t come back 
you can have my porsche 
you are receiving this broadcast in order
to alter the events you are seeing 
our technology has not developed
a transmitter strong enough   
to reach your conscious
and your awareness 
what were you dreaming 
your kingdom  father  does
not include my unconscious 
it s mine  and i may abuse it
any way i wish   
without having to confess
what s in it 
something i haven t
told you 
the brotherhood of sleep   
anyone in close proximity   
has the same dream 
the one you had
just now 
um   
excuse me  but i   
the guardian priests had
the dream for years 
what does it mean 
a premonition 
the dream evolves 
unfolds 
we shall start to have it
every time we go to sleep 
as if it s pushing
everything else out 
making room for itself 
mullins 
do you think he really
just took off 
i mean  like he was actually
believing this whole business 
why is everybody
looking at me that way 
 cause you re being asshole ish  that s
very asshole ish of you to say so 
look  mullins is probably
off asleep someplace 
or he s boffing
the radiologist 
i hope he s getting laid  i hope they re both
on their way to a nice chinese restaurant 
how can you keep
working like this 
it s    3 30 
no wonder i m so tired 
i keep getting these figures
in the computer 
but they re not
making any sense 
i stopped making sense
about 15 minutes ago 
no  i mean these equations
are beyond me now 
they re like another language  mmm 
go get some sleep 
i ll wake you in half an hour 
oh  45 minutes 
okay 
hey  are you okay 
no 
i know what you mean 
i just want to go home  pretend
none of this is really happening 
what s that 
hmm 
oh  it s just a bruise
i got somehow 
finally stopped hurting 
this looks like a figure
of some kind 
no  i got to close my eyes  okay 
i ll wake you 
thanks 
hello 
i m opening the door  if you want to stop
what you re doing and put your clothes on 
big doings in the lab tonight 
there s a meeting 
oh  give me just 15 minutes 
you want me to come back 
later 
any luck 
can t find anybody 
i m going up to the lab 
i ll be there in a minute 
we re having a meeting
in the lab 
lisa  
mona lisa 
lisa 
this whole building is gonna
have to be encased in concrete 
no way  a building this size  i
say we launch the fucker into space 
i m hearing something 
where are the others 
we think they ve left 
kelly s asleep  i didn t
want to wake her up 
i m asking you to stay 
the work that we do in the
next 48 hours is critical 
how many of you have fallen
asleep tonight  please  tell me 
come on  please 
you dreamed    you dreamed about
the front of this church 
about a dark figure coming out 
didn t you   
didn t you feel it 
not like a dream 
like something else 
here 
i had the dream too 
this image of something that didn t
seem to belong to my subconscious 
almost if i was watching
something prerecorded 
tachyons 
one possibility 
what s that 
  it s a greek word 
it means  swift one   
so what is the dream 
huh  precognition 
previous knowledge
of a future event 
a shared vision of something
that is yet to occur 
caused by that thing
downstairs  perhaps not 
tachyon is a subatomic particle
that travels faster than light 
supposing it isn t a dream 
supposing it s a message 
what if these dreams 
premonitions  omens   
what if they re really   
visual messages sent
by other human beings 
photographs 
video signals 
from where 
the future 
anything traveling faster
than the speed of light   
would appear to be
going backward in time 
a future scientist calculates
the exact spot   
that the earth occupied
in space in the past 
given trajectory and speed 
he then beams
a tachyon signal   
at that spot 
transmitting video information
backwards through time 
for us to receive as electrical
impulses  neural stimulus 
man  oh  man 
for what purpose 
could be a warning 
to show us
what s going to happen 
a sort of   
remote camera view
of the future 
so that we can change it 
someone has finally
shown up to tell us 
i think it s time we stood up
for what we are 
i think there s something wrong with
this  i m not getting anything now 
it s gone dead 
maybe the generator s dead  no  it looks
more like the units downstairs were cut off 
hello  hello 
hey  wyndham 
hello  hello 
come here 
look at this 
i ve got a message for you 
and you re not
going to like it 
look at his chest 
pray for death 
jesus christ 
calder 
no  calder 
no  no 
oh   
no 
kelly 
aah 
hey  hey  you guys 
they got the back doors
blocked away there 
what the hell s
happening here 
the back doors are locked 
you okay 
check the windows 
what s going on here 
we can t get out  
  it s in here 
don t come in here 
go  go  go 
lock the door 
come on 
get over here 
the sun s coming up 
normally  i love
being dominated by women 
lisa  i m sorry about
what i said before 
you don t look asian
at all 
shit 
i thought i heard walter 
walter  walter 
what the fuck do you want 
where are you 
if i told you 
you wouldn t believe me 
hey  can you dig through
and get me out of here 
i don t know  the wall s
pretty thick  are you all right 
well  that s a relative
thing right now  but yeah 
wait a second 
they re just standing there
outside 
not trying to get in  they ve
stopped attacking for some reason 
walter  where are you 
exactly 
i m in this closet 
i think we can
get through with this 
it s gonna take a while 
walter  we re gonna
try and dig through 
how long will it take 
a couple ofhours 
oh  great  i ll tell you what 
i ll hang out here anyway 
well  get ready
to pull me back 
come on  brian  come here 
come on  brian 
come on  let s go 
now 
come on   come up here 
come on  man  hurry up  
come on   come on  brian 
come on   come on  brian 
come on  
come on 
you guys seen
any movies you like 
all right 
ajewish mother goes to the airport
to meet her daughter 
the daughter steps off the plane
with an eight foot tall zulu warrior   
with a bone through his nose 
the mother screams 
 you fool 
i said a rich doctor  
not a dream 
we are using your brain s
electrical system as a receiver 
we are unable to transmit
through conscious neuro interference 
you are receiving this broadcast
as a dream 
we are transmitting
from the year 1 9 9   
we can try the hallway
after it gets dark 
if i can make my way up front  i could
break some windows  call for help 
no one out there
can help us 
the other morning you said that
you had something to tell me 
and you probably   
think that none of that
matters now 
but you re wrong 
it s the only thing
that does 
worker ants  driven
to a higher purpose 
unknown
to the individual 
street people   
our colleagues 
all controlled 
demonic possession 
of a kind 
not what we would
expect  though  never that 
why would he need us 
the book says his purpose
is to bring the father   
back from the dark side 
wherever that is 
there could be a limit as to
what he could do  you know 
as a volume of liquid 
he controls simple
organisms easily 
but maybe he needs something more
complex to complete a life cycle 
a host in which to live 
hello  hello 
  walter 
  it s kelly  she s changing again 
the swelling s gone down  as if the
liquid was absorbed into her system 
i can see tissue changes
on her face

her bone structure is changing 
maybe this is the only way
he could actualize his power 
a parasite
growing into its host 
this could be
some kind of gestation period 
i know i d seen it before 
kelly had a mark  it was a
bruise  almost like a figure 
i saw it in a history book   
the astrologer s staff 
used in ritual magic
in the middle ages 
the mark was on her

that vile serpent   
will not happen now 
the smaller parts
could not live   
without the strength
of the whole 
they had to die 
to fade away 
as the whole was thrown
back and repelled 
we re safe 
but he s waiting
on the other side
