the good king had died
and no one could decide
who was rightful heir to the throne
it seemed that the land
would be torn by war
or saved by a miracle alone
and that miracle appeared
in london town
the sword
in the stone
and below the hilt
in letters of gold
were written these words
whoso pulleth out this sword
of this stone and anvil
is rightwise king born of england
though many tried for the sword
with all their strength
none could move the sword nor stir it
so the miracle had not worked
and england was still without a king
and in time
the marvelous sword was forgotten
this was a dark age
without law and without order
men lived in fear of one another
for the strong preyed upon the weak
a dark age indeed
age of inconvenience
no plumbing
no electricity
no nothing
oh
oh hang it all
hang it all

one blasted thing
oh now just a moment i
tight grip on the lance
oh
loose in the saddle knees in tight
weight forward and stay on target
you keep losing your grip
its not a mere matter of muscle son
jousting is a fine skill
it its a highly developed science
science indeed
one dummy trying to knock off
another dummy with a bit of a stick
and the warts just as hot for it
as the rest of them
he certainly is
that boys got real spark
lots of spirit
throws himself heart and soul
into everything he does
thats really worth something if it can
be turned in the right direction
fat chance of that
oh i plan to cheat of course
use magic
every last trick in the trade if i have to
id give anything to go riding about
on a great white charger
slaying dragons and griffins
and maneating giants
well wont you
oh no
you see im an orphan
and a knight must be of proper birth
i only hope im worthy
to be kays squire
thats a big job too you know
oh indeed yes yes
i would say almost impossible
yes well now then
when i said i could swim like a fish
i really meant as a fish
you mean you can turn yourself
into a fish
after all i happen to be a wizard
could you turn me into a fish
do you have any imagination
can you imagine yourself as a fish
oh thats easy
ive done that lots of times
oh
well good then i think that my magic
can do the rest
uh
archimedes what is that fish formula
who who what
you know that latin business
fish latin oh uh
aquarius aquaticus aqualitus
and now if you dont mind
i say good day to the both of you
if you please
when he stays out all night
hes always grumpy the next morning
he must stay out every night
yes yes
oh oh yes i say thats very good boy
who what what
all right boy all set here we go
aquarius aquaticus aqualitus quom
aquadigitarium
merlin am i a fish
am i a fish
yes yes yes you are a fish
if you dont stop
flipping and flopping around
and get in the water you wont last long
now stay right here in the tules
and ill be with you in a minute
so you thought you could take right off
like a shot did you
well i am a fish arent i
you merely look like a fish
that doesnt mean
you can swim like one
you dont have the instinct
so youll have to use your brain
for a change
you are living between two planes now
somewhere between the ceiling
and the floor
now there are lots of ups and downs
like a helicopter
helicopter
yes
it it no never mind
every flick of a fin creates movement
so first well start with the caudal fin
no no boy your tail tail
now that gives you the forward thrust
now lets get a rhythm
right left right left
one two left and right
by day and night
thats what makes the world go round
in and out
thin and stout
thats what makes the world go round
for every up there is a down
for every square
there is a round
yes
for every high
there is a low
and for every to
there is a
fro
fro
yes fro
to and fro stop and go
thats what makes the world go round
in and out
thin and stout
merlin merlin
i swallowed a bug
oh
whats wrong with that
after all boy you are a fish
instincts you know
but you said i had no instinct
yes oh
oh i did thats neither here nor there
the main thing is you must
set your sights upon the heights
dont be a mediocrity
mediocrity
thats right
dont just wait and trust to fate
and say thats how its meant to be
its up to you how far you go
if you dont try youll never know
and so my lad as ive explained
nothing ventured nothing gained
lets lets swim through
that tall grass again it tickles
oh oh i beg your pardon
me too
for every to there is a fro
for every stop there is a go
and thats what makes
the world go round
oh let go let go let go
you big bugeyed bully you
who me
oh here here here
here here now boy
no sense going around
insulting bullfrogs
a fish has plenty of other problems
without that
the water world has its forests
and its jungles too
so it has its tigers and its wolves
but that
thats what makes the world go round
you see my boy
its natures way
upon the weak
the strong ones prey
in human life its also true
the strong will try to conquer you
that is what you must expect
unless you use your intellect
brains and brawn
weak and strong
merlin help help
thats what makes the worl
jehoshaphat
quick merlin the magic
no no youre on your own lad
nows your chance to prove my point
what point
hes the brawn and youre the brain
now dont panic
you use your head
outsmart the big brute
smart move lad
thats using the old intellect
bravo boy great strategy
is the lesson about over
did you get the point
yes yes brain over brawn
ok lad ill fix the big brute
higgly piggly no no
hocus pocus no what the blazes
hey didda dihicka

by george i
ill turn him into a minnow
merlin
oh there you are boy
snick snack snorrel
how in the world
did you ever get out of that mess
that big fish almost swallowed me
and archimedes he he saved me
well by jove
now what do you know about that
i
i did nothing of the sort
i intended to eat him
young perch is my favorite dish
you know that
oh
do you believe that wart
well i
wart wart
ive got to go thank you merlin
it was so much fun and archimedes i
pin feathers boy
wart
where are you wart
coming im coming
now archimedes
why would you half drown yourself
for a tidbit of fish
and after such a big breakfast
pin feathers and gully fluff
we were doing fine
until we got in deep water
then along comes this huge pike
with big jaws and sharp jagged teeth
oh turn him off dad
he was a monster
the biggest fish i ever saw
and boy thats the biggest fish story
i ever heard
but its true sir
thats three demerits for being late
and three more for the fish story
now hop it to the kitchen
i told you the wart was loony
hes either out of his head or
theres something fishy going on here
for every high there is a low
for every to there is a fro
to and fro
stop and go
thats what makes the world go round
oh its you merlin sir
yes my lad
now have you ever considered
being a squirrel
no i dont suppose
well now
there is a tiny creature
with enormous problems
how he has survived
throughout the ages
is one of natures big mysteries
his life is hazardous
downright dangerous
would you like to try it
oh no id better not
oh
too dangerous for you eh
oh no its not that
its just that ive got six demerits
all this work to do
what a mess
what a medieval muddle
well have to modernize it
start an assembly line system
all right now
a one and a two and a three and a four
higitus figitus
migitus mum

wart oh no boy no no
wart
wha wait whoa
now what did i tell you
always look before you leap
well i made it didnt i
yes yes you made it you made it
but you cant always trust to luck boy
now first you start with the short jumps
gauge the distance carefully and
there you see
even then you can miss
so dont take gravity too lightly
or itll catch up with you
whats gravity
gravitys what causes you to fall
oh like a stumble or a trip
yes like a stumble or a
no no no
its the force that pulls you downward
the phenomenon that
any two material particles or bodies
if free to move
will be accelerated toward each other
merlin how will we get by
hmm oh
well i suppose we better go back
to a sidetrack
go on go on youve got lots of room
well i guess she cant be sidetracked
thats a girl squirrel
and a redhead at that
she sure acts funny
she likes you
why
yes well well thats nature again
but im afraid theres no time to explain
here now
youd better leave me out of it
yeah me too
merlin
merlin
youre on your own lad
im afraid magic
cant solve this problem
look im not a boy i mean
im not a squirrel im a boy
a human boy not a real sq
oh leave me alone
merlin what will i do
she wont leave me
well im afraid youre stuck lad
when a girl squirrel chooses a mate
its for life
but i wont be a squirrel tomorrow
she doesnt know that
she only knows one simple fact
that youre a him and shes a her
its a natural phenomenon
phenomenon
well its the
its a state of being
a frame of mind
its a most befuddling thing
and to every being
of every kind
it is discomboomerating
youre wasting time resisting
youll find the more you do
the more shell keep insisting
her him has got to be you
now leave me alone
i mean it
its a rough game anyone knows
go away
there are no rules
anything goes
theres no logical explanation
for this discomboomeration
its a most bemuddling
most befuddling thing

well
what have i got to lose
thats the spirit well start tomorrow
well show em wont we boy

now first of all lad
weve got to get all of these
medieval ideas out of your head
clear the way for new ideas
knowledge of mans fabulous
discoveries in the centuries ahead
now that will be a great advantage
advantage indeed
if the boy says the world is round
theyll take him for a lunatic
the world is round
yes yes thats right
and it also goes around
you mean itll be round someday
no no no its round now
man will discover this
in centuries to come
and he will also find
that the world is merely a tiny speck
in the universe
universe
ah youre only confusing the boy
hell be so mixed up hell
hell be wearing his shoes on his head
man has always learned from the past
after all you cant learn history
in reverse
its confusing enough
for heavens sakes
all right all right
have it your way archimedes
youre in charge
youre the headmaster now
so from now on hes your pupil
so from now on boy
you do as i say
yes sir
all right
now to start off
i want you to read these books
all of them
that my boy
is a mountain of knowledge
but i cant read
what what what
i dont suppose you know how to write
no sir
well what do you know
well i
never mind never mind
well start at the bottom the abcs
first the a and now the b
loop and around and theres the c
merlin look i can write
oh yes yes thats very good boy
hen scratch thats all hen scratch
now come on d e f
and now the g
you see its as simple as
no no no no boy
use your head use your head will you
how do you expect to learn anything
archimedes
have you seen
that flying machine model
i have nothing to do with your
futuristic fiddlefaddle you know that
whats that thing up there
hmm
oh yes of course here we are
do you mean man will fly
in one of those someday
if man were meant to fly
hed have been born with wings
i am about to prove otherwise
archimedes if you care to watch
here she goes
no no no
man will fly all right
just like a rock
it would have worked if
if it werent for this infernal beard
i never
never in my whole
man will fly someday i tell you
i have been there i have seen it
oh i do hope so
ive always dreamed about flying
that i was a bird and that
i could go sailing all over the sky
high above everything
avis alitus avita atheta
prestidigitonium
its my favorite dream
oh but then i suppose
everybody dreams about flying
im a bird im a bird im a bird
hold it boy not so fast not so fast
first id better explain
the mechanics of a birds wing
now these large feathers
are called the primaries and
and since when do you know
all about birds wings
i have made an extensive study
of birds in flight and i
and if you dont mind
i happen to be a bird
all right mr knowitall
hes your pupil
ouch
now boy flying is not merely
some crude mechanical process
it is a delicate art purely aesthetic
poetry of motion
and the best way to learn it is to do it
now since were pretty far up
well start with a glide
spread your wings way out way out
thats it thats it
now fan your tail
tippety toe tippety toe and off we go
now tuck your feet under like me
thats it thats the idea
whoa what
and dont fight the air currents
use them
why say boy
thats pretty good
well boy youre a natural
are you sure this is
the first time that you
wart wart hawk hawk
look out boy heads up
come on wart
archimedes help
wart wart
what oh
sounds like someones sick
how lovely
i do hope its serious
something dreadful
oh bat gizzards
its nothing but a scrawny little sparrow
with a beak full of soot
oh im not really a sparrow im a boy
a boy
merlin changed me with his magic
hes the worlds most powerful wizard
