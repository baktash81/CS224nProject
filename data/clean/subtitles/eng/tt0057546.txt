the good king had died
and no one could decide
who was rightful heir to the throne
it seemed that the land
would be torn by war
or saved by a miracle alone
and that miracle appeared
in london town
the sword
in the stone
and below the hilt 
in letters of gold 
were written these words 
 whoso pulleth out this sword
of this stone and anvil
 is rightwise king born of england  
though many tried for the sword
with all their strength 
none could move the sword  nor stir it 
so  the miracle had not worked 
and england was still without a king 
and in time 
the marvelous sword was forgotten 
this was a dark age 
without law and without order 
men lived in fear of one another 
for the strong preyed upon the weak 
a dark age  indeed 
age of inconvenience 
no plumbing 
no electricity 
no nothing 
oh 
oh  hang it all 
hang it all 
oh  now what  now what 
leave off  leave off 
oh  you    you fiendish chain  you 
everything complicated 
one big medieval mess 
now  let me see  um   
he should be here in   
uh  i d say half an hour 
who  who 
i d like to know who 
i told you  archimedes  i am not sure 
all i know is that someone
will be coming 
someone very important 
oh  pin feathers 
fate will direct him to me
so that i in turn may guide him
to his rightful place in the world 
huh  and you say he will arrive
in half an hour 
ha  well  we ll just see 
and you will  archimedes  you will 
ow 
he ll be a boy 
a small boy 
eleven  12 years old 
and a scrawny little fellow 
oh  no  no  no  that can t be the one 
surely not  why  that big lad
must be close on to 20 
ah 
there he is 
the scrawny little fellow  about 12 
he s a regular little grasshopper 
look at him go 
and where  where would you guess
he is at this very moment 
i am not guessing  archimedes

uh    less than a mile from here 
just beyond the forest 
and right on schedule

a soothsayer  a prognosticator 
i have the power to see into the future 
centuries into the future 
i ve even been there  lad 
and i ve seen all these things 
they re only plans and small models

for hundreds of years 
oh  you mean you can see everything
before it happens 
yes  everything 
ah  ah  ah  ah

how else would you get all this stuff
into one suitcase  i d like to know 
  but i think it s wonderful 
  oh  yes  it is  rather 
now  don t you get any foolish ideas
that magic will solve all your problems 
because it won t 
but sir  i don t have any problems 
oh  everybody s got problems 
the world is full of problems 
oh  blast it all 
there  now you see what i did 
that s the trouble with the world today

all muscle and no mentality 
do you want to be all muscle
and no brain 
  i don t have any muscle 
  you don t 
  well  how do you move about

how do you expect to amount
to anything without an education 
even in these bungling 
backward medieval times
you have got to know
where you re going  don t you 
yes  sir

you must plan for the future  boy 
you ve got to find a direction 
and you ve got

oh 
all right  we d better get a move on 
come on  lad  pick up the pace 
oh  the devil take it

  well  blast it all  i am 
after all  i took him in 
adopted the lad  you might say

four hours extra kitchen duty 
  report to the cook 
  but i d like you to meet   
go on  hop it  boy  hop  hop  hop it

and let s hear all about it 
they re having a big tournament
new year s day 
oh  that s not news  dash it all 
  they always do 
  but ector  ector 
here s where
all the excitement comes in 
to the winner of this tournament
goes the crown 
you mean   
you mean he ll be king of all england 
king of all england 
kay  lad  did you hear that 
pretty fair prize  i d say

wart  lad 
how d you like to go to london 
oh  sir ector  you mean it 
if you stick to your duties

oh  i will  sir  i will 
i don t want the wart for my squire 
here s to london  and here s to kay 
and here s to the banner
of the castle of the forest sauvage 
  cheers 
  cheers  cheers 
charge 
wait  boy  lean into it 
steady  boy  steady 
steady with the lance 
do it  white knight  hit him clean 
no  no  no 
heads up 
archimedes 
archimedes  where are we 
in a tumbled down old tower
in the most miserable old castle
in all christendom  that s where 
uh  c    castle  castle 
don t you even remember the boy 
uh    the boy 
can t you remember
one blasted thing 
oh  now  just a moment  i   
  tight grip on the lance 
  oh 
loose in the saddle  knees in tight 
weight forward and stay on target 
you keep losing your grip 
it s not a mere matter of muscle  son 
jousting is a fine skill 
it    it s a highly developed science 
science  indeed 
one dummy trying to knock off
another dummy with a bit of a stick 
and the wart s just as hot for it
as the rest of them 
he certainly is 
that boy s got real spark 
lots of spirit 
throws himself heart and soul
into everything he does 
that s really worth something if it can
be turned in the right direction 
fat chance of that 
oh  i plan to cheat  of course 
use magic 
every last trick in the trade if i have to 
i d give anything to go riding about
on a great white charger 
slaying dragons and griffins
and man eating giants 
  well  won t you 
  oh  no 
you see  i m an orphan
and a knight must be of proper birth 
i only hope i m worthy
to be kay s squire 
that s a big job too  you know 
oh  indeed  yes  yes 
i would say almost impossible 
yes  well  now then 
when i said i could swim like a fish 
i really meant as a fish 
you mean you can turn yourself
into a fish 
after all  i happen to be a wizard 
could you turn me into a fish 
do you have any imagination 
can you imagine yourself as a fish 
oh  that s easy 
  i ve done that lots of times 
  oh 
well  good  then i think that my magic
can do the rest 
uh   
archimedes  what is that fish formula 
who  who  what 
you know  that latin business 
fish  latin  oh  uh   
aquarius  aquaticus  aqualitus 
and now  if you don t mind 
i say good day to the both of you 
if you please 
when he stays out all night
he s always grumpy the next morning 
  he must stay out every night 
  yes  yes 
oh  oh  yes  i say  that s very good  boy 
who  what  what 
all right  boy  all set  here we go 
aquarius  aquaticus  aqualitus quom 
aquadigitarium 
merlin  am i a fish 
am i a fish 
yes  yes  yes  you are a fish 
if you don t stop
flipping and flopping around
and get in the water you won t last long 
now  stay right here in the tules
and i ll be with you in a minute 
so  you thought you could take right off
like a shot  did you 
well  i am a fish  aren t i 
you merely look like a fish 
that doesn t mean
you can swim like one 
you don t have the instinct 
so  you ll have to use your brain
for a change 
you are living between two planes now 
somewhere between the ceiling
and the floor 
now  there are lots of ups and downs 
like a helicopter 
  helicopter 
  yes 
it    it    no  never mind 
every flick of a fin creates movement 
so  first we ll start with the caudal fin 
no  no  boy  your tail  tail 
now  that gives you the forward thrust 
now  let s get a rhythm 
right  left  right  left
one  two  left and right
by day and night
that s what makes the world go round
in and out
thin and stout
that s what makes the world go round
for every up there is a down
  for every square
  there is a round 
yes 
  for every high
  there is a low 
and for every to
  there is a   
  fro 
  fro 
  yes  fro 
to and fro  stop and go
that s what makes the world go round
in and out
thin and stout
merlin  merlin 
  i swallowed a bug 
  oh 
what s wrong with that 
after all  boy  you are a fish 
instincts  you know 
but you said i had no instinct 
yes  oh 
oh  i did  that s neither here nor there 
the main thing is  you must   
set your sights upon the heights
don t be a mediocrity
  mediocrity 
  that s right 
don t just wait and trust to fate
and say that s how it s meant to be
it s up to you how far you go
if you don t try you ll never know
and so  my lad  as i ve explained
nothing ventured  nothing gained
let s    let s swim through
that tall grass again  it tickles 
oh  oh  i beg your pardon 
me  too 
for every to there is a fro
for every stop there is a go
and that s what makes
the world go round
oh  let go  let go  let go 
you big bug eyed bully  you 
who  me 
oh  here  here  here 
here  here now  boy 
no sense going around
insulting bullfrogs 
a fish has plenty of other problems
without that 
the water world has its forests
and its jungles  too 
so  it has its tigers and its wolves 
but that   
that s what makes the world go round
you see  my boy
it s nature s way
upon the weak
the strong ones prey
in human life  it s also true
the strong will try to conquer you
that is what you must expect
unless you use your intellect
brains and brawn
weak and strong
  merlin  help  help 
  that s what makes the worl   
jehoshaphat 
  quick  merlin  the magic 
  no  no  you re on your own  lad 
  now s your chance to prove my point 
  what point 
he s the brawn and you re the brain 
now  don t panic 
you use your head 
outsmart the big brute 
smart move  lad 
that s using the old intellect 
bravo  boy  great strategy 
  is the lesson about over 
  did you get the point 
yes  yes  brain over brawn 
ok  lad  i ll fix the big brute 
higgly piggly    no  no 
hocus pocus    no  what the blazes   
  hey didda dihicka   
  merlin 
hmm  now what 
oh  is it that  that boy 
  what in blazes   
  help  help 
help 
ouch 
help 
hmm  oh   
archimedes 
help 
what    what in   
what in thunder is a monster like that
doing in the moat 
by george  i   
i ll turn him into a minnow 
  merlin 
  oh  there you are  boy 
snick  snack  snorrel 
how in the world
did you ever get out of that mess 
that big fish almost swallowed me 
and archimedes  he  he saved me 
well  by jove 
now  what do you know about that 
i   
i did nothing of the sort 
i intended to eat him 
young perch is my favorite dish 
  you know that 
  oh   
  do you believe that  wart 
  well  i   
wart  wart 
i ve got to go  thank you  merlin 
it was so much fun  and archimedes  i   
  pin feathers  boy 
  wart 
  where are you  wart 
  coming  i m coming 
now  archimedes 
why would you half drown yourself
for a tidbit of fish 
and after such a big breakfast 
pin feathers and gully fluff 
we were doing fine
until we got in deep water 
then along comes this huge pike
with big jaws and sharp jagged teeth 
  oh  turn him off  dad 
  he was a monster 
the biggest fish i ever saw 
and  boy  that s the biggest fish story
i ever heard 
  but it s true  sir 
  that s three demerits for being late
and three more for the fish story 
now  hop it to the kitchen 
i told you the wart was loony 
he s either out of his head or
there s something fishy going on here 
for every high there is a low
for every to there is a fro
to and fro
stop and go
that s what makes the world go round
  oh  it s you  merlin  sir 
  yes  my lad 
now  have you ever considered
being a squirrel 
  no  i don t suppose 
  well  now 
there is a tiny creature
with enormous problems 
how he has survived
throughout the ages
is one of nature s big mysteries 
his life is hazardous 
downright dangerous 
would you like to try it 
oh  no  i d better not 
oh 
too dangerous for you  eh 
oh  no  it s not that 
it s just that i ve got six demerits 
all this work to do 
what a mess 
what a medieval muddle 
we ll have to modernize it 
start an assembly line system 
all right  now 
a one and a two and a three and a four 
higitus  figitus 
migitus  mum
tittendy  bittendy  buttondy  dum
but i m supposed to do it 
no one will know the difference  son
who cares
as long as the work gets done 
rubbety  scrubbety  sweepity  flew
come on  son  let s go  let s go 
wart 
wart 
wart  take it easy  take it easy  boy 
wart  oh  no  boy  no  no 
  wart 
  wha    wait  whoa 
now  what did i tell you 
always look before you leap 
well  i made it  didn t i 
yes  yes  you made it  you made it 
but you can t always trust to luck  boy 
now  first you start with the short jumps 
gauge the distance carefully and   
there  you see 
even then you can miss 
so  don t take gravity too lightly
or it ll catch up with you 
  what s gravity 
  gravity s what causes you to fall 
  oh  like a stumble or a trip 
  yes  like a stumble or a   
no  no  no 
it s the force that pulls you downward 
the phenomenon that
any two material particles or bodies 
if free to move 
will be accelerated toward each other 
merlin  how will we get by 
hmm  oh 
well  i suppose we better go back
to a sidetrack 
go on  go on  you ve got lots of room 
well  i guess she can t be sidetracked 
that s a girl squirrel
and a redhead  at that 
  she sure acts funny 
  she likes you 
why 
yes  well  well  that s nature again 
but i m afraid there s no time to explain 
here now 
you d better leave me out of it 
yeah  me  too 
merlin 
  merlin 
  you re on your own  lad 
i m afraid magic
can t solve this problem 
look  i m not a boy    i mean

a human boy  not a real sq   
oh  leave me alone 
merlin  what will i do 
she won t leave me   
well  i m afraid you re stuck  lad 
when a girl squirrel chooses a mate 
it s for life 
but i won t be a squirrel tomorrow 
she doesn t know that 
she only knows one simple fact 
that you re a him and she s a her 
it s a natural phenomenon 
phenomenon 
well  it s the   
it s a state of being 
a frame of mind
it s a most befuddling thing
and to every being
of every kind
it is discomboomerating
you re wasting time resisting
you ll find the more you do
the more she ll keep insisting
her  him  has got to be you
now  leave me alone 
i mean it 
it s a rough game  anyone knows
go away 
there are no rules
anything goes
there s no logical explanation
for this discomboomeration
it s a most bemuddling
most befuddling thing
oof  who  who  what the   
now  go on  shoo 
get a tree of your own 
skedaddle 
oh  you squirrelly squirrels 
ha ha  she s gaining on you  wart

we sure will 
now  first of all  lad 
we ve got to get all of these
medieval ideas out of your head 
clear the way for new ideas 
knowledge of man s fabulous
discoveries in the centuries ahead 
now  that will be a great advantage 
advantage  indeed 
if the boy says the world is round
they ll take him for a lunatic 
  the world is round 
  yes  yes  that s right 
and it also goes around 
  you mean  it ll be round someday 
  no  no  no  it s round now 
man will discover this
in centuries to come 
and he will also find
that the world is merely a tiny speck
in the universe 
  universe 
  ah  you re only confusing the boy 
he ll be so mixed up he ll   
he ll be wearing his shoes on his head 
man has always learned from the past 
after all  you can t learn history
in reverse 
it s confusing enough 
for heaven s sakes 
all right  all right 
have it your way  archimedes 
you re in charge 
you re the headmaster now 
so  from now on he s your pupil 
so  from now on  boy 
you do as i say 
  yes  sir 
  all right 
now  to start off 
i want you to read these books 
all of them 
that  my boy 
is a mountain of knowledge 
  but i can t read 
  what  what  what 
  i don t suppose you know how to write 
  no  sir 
  well  what do you know 
  well  i   
never mind  never mind 
we ll start at the bottom  the abc s 
first the a and now the b 
loop and around and there s the c 
merlin  look  i can write 
oh  yes  yes  that s very good  boy 
hen scratch  that s all  hen scratch 
now  come on  d  e  f 
and now the g 
you see  it s as simple as   
no  no  no  no  boy 
use your head  use your head  will you 
how do you expect to learn anything 
archimedes 
have you seen
that flying machine model 
i have nothing to do with your
futuristic fiddle faddle  you know that 
  what s that thing up there 
  hmm 
oh  yes  of course  here we are 
do you mean man will fly
in one of those someday 
if man were meant to fly 
he d have been born with wings 
i am about to prove otherwise 
archimedes  if you care to watch 
here she goes 
no  no  no 
man will fly  all right 
just like a rock 
it would have worked if   
if it weren t for this infernal beard 
i never   
never in my whole   
man will fly someday  i tell you 
i have been there  i have seen it 
oh  i do hope so 
i ve always dreamed about flying 
that i was a bird and that
i could go sailing all over the sky 
high above everything 
avis alitus avita atheta 
prestidigitonium 
it s my favorite dream 
oh  but then  i suppose
everybody dreams about flying 
i m a bird  i m a bird  i m a bird 
hold it  boy  not so fast  not so fast 
first  i d better explain
the mechanics of a bird s wing 
now  these large feathers
are called the primaries  and   
and since when do you know
all about birds  wings 
i have made an extensive study
of birds in flight and i   
and if you don t mind 
i happen to be a bird 
all right  mr  know it all 
he s your pupil 
ouch 
now  boy  flying is not merely
some crude mechanical process 
it is a delicate art  purely aesthetic 
poetry of motion 
and the best way to learn it is to do it 
now  since we re pretty far up 
we ll start with a glide 
spread your wings way out  way out 
that s it  that s it 
now  fan your tail 
tippety toe  tippety toe and off we go 
now  tuck your feet under like me 
that s it  that s the idea 
whoa  what 
and don t fight the air currents 
use them 
why  say  boy 
that s pretty good 
well  boy  you re a natural 
are you sure this is
the first time that you   
wart  wart  hawk  hawk 
look out  boy  heads up 
come on  wart 
archimedes  help 
wart  wart
