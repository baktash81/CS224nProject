happy anniversary 
and if you ll allow me 
a special toast to this man   
a man of endless energy
and ambition   
the cream of the new south   
my dear friend
and new senior partner   
in what will soon be the finest real
estate development in new orleans   
the new pontchartrain estates 
thank you  bob 
bob has very generously
referred to me   
as part of the cream
of the new south 
i think that might be
a little bit genteel for me 
i would be more inclined
to consider myself more of   
oh  skim milk of the middle west
or something 
energy   
ambition 
i would hope   
that we could direct
those qualities   
to try and retain   
for the new south   
some of the graceful values
of the old south 
  daddy

call the police 
i guess i ll have to take my money
out of the pontchartrain project 
i know  court 
just thinkin  about it
makes me sick 
you know  i m not gonna
take advantage of this 
we re gonna develop the land
just as you planned 
we ll build your park 
hell  i like trees 
if you pick up the option 
you re not obligated to do my plan 
you can do anything you want with it 
you know that 
i want to do this thing for you 
thanks  bob  i appreciate that 
of course  there s still
a week on the option 
if the police can get your money back

inspector brie is here 
he d like to see you right now 
  would you send him in 
  okay 
hello  inspector 
thank you for coming out  sit down 
thank you 
would you like a cup of coffee 
no  thank you  mr  courtland 
it s an excruciating situation 
i guess i don t have to
tell you that 
preparing for the worst
and hoping for the best 
i ve seen many cases
very similar to this 
they all ended up with the successful
return of the hostages   
and the apprehension
of the kidnappers 
it s just a matter of intelligence
and calm nerves 
just try to leave this as much
as possible to us  mr  courtland 
there s nothing you can really do 
i m willing to pay the money 
the money isn t important 
that s the hell of it  mr  courtland 
these men are professionals 
if they re caught without the loot 
they give up 
if they got the money in hand 
we may have a very dangerous fight 
are you sure 
absolutely 
it is  of course 
finally your decision 
what would you do 
something the lab has developed 
something the lab has developed 
we go through the drop
as instructed 
false money
and a small radio transmitter   
in a locked briefcase 
we track the pickup man
by radio truck 
he leads us to the hostages 
foolproof 
at no point will the lives
of your wife and daughter be in danger 
just leave it to us 
give me an estimation 
i got it  i got it 
you oughta be happy  little girl 
your daddy come through with the money 
everything s gonna be all right 
mommy  mommy 
daddy brought the money 
what the hell is that 
transmitter 
son of a bitch 
look at this  this is what
your old man thinks you re worth 
  nothin  
  mommy 
this is detective brie 
this is detective brie
of the new orleans police force 
the house is surrounded 
come out with your hands raised
and you will not be harmed 
  what do we do 
  be calm  get the knife 
don t panic 
cut those ropes
and let s get outta here 
break that window open 
mommy  mommy 
don t shoot unless you
want the kid to get it 
hold your fire  hold your fire 
peterson  this is brie 
we re on the broussard road
approaching the bridge 
are your roadblocks in place 
all set on your side  inspector 
i m helping an oil truck
off the road over here 
get it out of there 
we re on the bridge now 
the wife and daughter of new orleans
businessman michael courtland   
were killed yesterday   
when a kidnap rescue effort
sadly backfired 
over here is inspector august brie 
who s in charge of this case 
inspector  can you tell us
exactly what happened here 
i m sorry 
i can t divulge any information
at this time 
it s just been too tragic 
that s all 
the police did all they could 
the search for the bodies
remains fruitless   
hampered by the explosion
of the automobile   
and the currents of the mississippi 
here are your tickets 
now  remember  you leave
at 12 30 tomorrow 
you arrive in rome at 9 10
and you take the rapido to florence 
  do you have your passport 
  yeah 
i ll put these in your briefcase 
you about ready  michael 
i won t be a second 
what s that italian s name 
d annunzio 
he s a bit of a bore 
i m afraid 
a rich one  though 
i hope his english
is better than my italian 
you let me take care of him 
he s very susceptible to flattery 
he s gonna love it when i tell him
he s as wise as caesar   
and as honest as the pope 
you know  i m gonna like
this trip  bob 
really  i m lookin  forward to it 
i can find out what you were doing on
the florentine junkets all these years 
food  money   
and above all art  my man 
i m a lover of fine art 
  it s my only vice 
  you re just a renaissance man  robert 
he said 8 00 
oh  thanks  bob 
you know  i think you re right 
i should have come back
to italy years ago 
i told you  old boy 
it s the birthplace of western art 
one thing that puzzles me 
how do these old guys
get such young wives 
  i ll ask them 
  don t 
i think so too  would you like
to see a picture of my wife 
picture of your wife 
go ahead  show him a picture 
as americans say   such a jewel  
wonderful woman 
and cook    such a cook 
she s lovely 
this is maria 
such a wonderful woman 
  and i have six children 
  she s lovely 
lovely lady 
aren t you glad you asked 
a fantastico woman 
that s why i have to make
so much money 
she loves money 
and she deserves it 
  everybody likes money 
  and women 
oh  not everybody likes money  signor 
you take my partner here 
michael 
he and i own  in new orleans   
one of the biggest  best plots of land
in the suburban city 
for 15  16 years   
he has refused to build anything
on that land 
nothing but a tomb 
if you gentlemen will excuse me 
it s a little late 
late  he thinks it s late 
hell  i haven t even danced yet 
you should have stayed with us
last night  court 
we aren t getting any younger 
found that out  did you 
you re not upset
about last night  are you 
so what are we gonna do today 
i don t know  i thought we might
just do a little sightseeing   
absorb a little culture
and a little less wine 
that sounds great 
isn t this the church
where you and elizabeth met 
i ll be right back 
well  how was it  court 
the same 
well  you about ready to go back
to the old u s  of a   court 
i thought i d like to stay around
a few more days 
oh 
i d like to go back
to that church again 
why do you wanna do that 
will you come with me 
well  okay  if it d
make you feel better 
oh  my god 
  you sure you re gonna be all right 
  yeah  i ll be fine 
  i just need a few days 
  all right 
you take real good care
of yourself now 
thanks  bob 
oh  that s all right 
i speak english 
you are american 
you like the madonna 
it was painted in 1328   
by bernardo daddi 
that s early renaissance 
  you a student 
  no 
i used to be   
what do you call it 
bilingual secretary 
then one day i read
about the restoration project   
and i said   sandra 
the madonna needs you  
so i quit my dull job 
and here i am   
an art historian 
i can t think of anything
more important 
well  at least they don t
holler and scream at you   
when you talk to strange men 
what do you do 
i m in land development 
real estate 
ah  well  that sounds important 
it s not 
my name is courtland 
michael courtland 
happy to meet you 
i m sandra 
sandra portinari 
you ve been doing this work
a long time 
oh  i m not doing the restoration 
i m just a workman 
but i prepare everything
for the specialist 
you see  several years ago   
long after the floods   
moisture seeped into a portion
of the altarpiece   
and it began to peel   
revealing an older painting
underneath 
then the art scholars
had to decide what to do 
should they remove and destroy
a great painting by daddi   
to uncover what appears to be
a crude first draft underneath it 
or should they restore
the original   
but never know for sure
what lies beneath it 
what would you do 
hold on to it 
beauty should be protected 
good  that is what
the scholars decided to do 
now you have a free lecture 
and you don t have to read the brochure 
i wondered if i might   
repay you for your lecture   
and ask you to dinner somewhere 
you don t understand 
dinner can be
a pretty serious affair here 
lunch  i know a place nearby 
signor  i thought it was the italian men
who picked up the american women 
all right  lunch 
but i have to work another
hour and a half before i go 
i ll wait 
so you were in florence before 
a long time ago 
i was stationed near here
after the war 
i wasn t even born 
but my mother often told me   
how hard times were then 
you live with your mother 
not anymore  i have an apartment
near ponte vecchio 
but i was raised by my mother 
my father deserted us
a long time ago 
that s sad 
what was florence like
during the occupation 
confused 
i m really not an expert
on the occupation 
my mind is elsewhere 
i met my wife there 
oh  the plot thickens 
let us sit and tell sad tales   
about deserted daughters
and lonely husbands 
i thought you had a familiar
melancholy look   
when you came into the church 
that wasn t   
she died a long time ago 
i m sorry  i didn t mean that 
it s just that a single girl   
meets a lot of men 
mostly americans   
who want to tell her
about their wives 
it s not very flattering 
what was she like 
elizabeth   
she was very much like you 
like me 
she was italian 
no  she looked very much like you 
do you have a picture of her 
i really have to go now 
may i see you again sometime 
sure 
we could have
a nonserious dinner 
  seriously 
  when 
  tonight 
  tonight 
is that all right 
that s only five hours from now 
plenty of time to change 
all right  but i have to go see
my mother at the hospital after work 
i ll meet you there 
oh  it s the san giovanni 
i know 
all right 
see you  ciao 
ciao 
you re very fond
of that restaurant  aren t you 
yeah 
that s where you met elizabeth 
no  we met in the church
where you re working 
we used to eat
in the restaurant though 
tell me about her 
  elizabeth 
  yes 
well  as i said before 
she s very much like you 
i mean 
she looked very much like you 
she had brown hair   
and wore it longer 
kind of different  you know 
and she wore pink lipstick 
and she never wore rouge 
oh  her walk   
her walk was 180 degrees
different than yours 
  different 
  yeah 
  she had a very bryn mawr walk 
  bryn mawr 
yeah  very bryn mawr 
what do you mean   bryn mawr  
bryn mawr 
that s kind of a walk 
it s    well  it s   
it s    i don t   
just walk  and i ll   
just go ahead and walk upstairs 
no  that s an italian walk 
what do you expect 
it s a good walk  but it s
just not a bryn mawr walk 
a bryn mawr walk
is a kind of a glide  you know 
those girls used to wear long polo coats
in those old days  long raincoats 
they kind of glide 
like they re late for class 
they move fast
and just kinda glide 
this time now  just glide 
i ll talk you through it  okay 
  all right 
  don t sashay so much  just glide 
  all right 
  go ahead 
just glide 
no  not like a model 
just glide 
that s it  that s it 
she called me mike 
mike 
listen  i am a good catholic girl 
i obey everything the pope says 
you know 
what would the pope say
if i saw you tomorrow 
you forget i have a job to do 
tomorrow night

all right  come closer now 
come closer 
a little closer 
what is that  a love sonnet
from an italian boyfriend 
no  it isn t  jealous 
that s dante 
 while life endures   
you should not ever
be inconstant to your lady   
who in death doth lie 
so speaks my heart
and afterwards doth sigh  
you know  as a child   
i used to go to the church   
where dante came
to watch beatrice 
beatrice  la bella donna 
would sit here   
with her father   
and there   
come here 
  over there 
  i m her father 
the young dante  23 years old   
would stand and watch beatrice 
and here   
in between   
sat the lady of the screen   
a lady dante pretended to love   
so that beatrice
would not be embarrassed   
by his continual gaze 
you still love elizabeth 
don t you 
that s why you want me 
how did she die 
i killed her 
i m sorry  but i must go
to the hospital right away 
  my mother s very ill 
  i ll go with you 
  it s not your problem  i go alone 
  please 
all right 
well  let s hurry then 
mama

you love my sandra 
oh  mama 
i must know now

you ll have to forgive my mother 
she s always been a matchmaker 
you rich 
you gangster 
you marry him 
mama  we hardly know each other 
you get to know him   
after you re married 
no matter how many times i read it 
it still says the same thing 
look at that 
 hold st  louis cathedral for may 2 
break out the champagne 
i m returning tuesday the 19th
for a church weddin  
love  michael  
poor court 
he s a goner now 
i tell you  jane 
if i hadn t seen it with my own eyes 
i wouldn t have believed it 
it was like elizabeth
had stepped out of her tomb 
yeah  well  you ll see
soon enough for yourself 
  do you think she s a gold digger 
  i don t know what to think 
maybe we should call dr  ellman 
  what good would he do 
  he s been treating court for years 
but ellman lives in 1975 
michael lives in 1959 
  mr  michael 
  judy 
good to see you too 
i want you to meet sandra 
sandra  this is judy 
a lifelong member of this house 
hello  miss sandra 
mr  michael wrote me about you 
  let me help you with this 
  thank you 
it s beautiful here 
now  this d annunzio florence deal
is lookin  awful good  court 
looks like the old goat is finally
gonna invest some big money with us 
now  i ve got a preliminary
breakdown here   
of the basic estimated
development cost and cash flow   
for the joint venture proposal 
i d like you to look those over
if you would 
you wouldn t file
an in personam suit against me   
if i asked you to table all this
for a while  would ya 
i mean  with the wedding plans
and everything  i m just not up to it 
  would you mind  for a while 
  can do  court 
can do  that s what
a partner s for  i guess 
well  our friends are certainly
looking forward to meetin  sandra 
they ll all meet her
on the big day 
big day of the big wedding 
big day of my new life 
how do you say in italian 
 la vita nuova  
look  court   
i know this is
none of my business   
but don t you think maybe
this is all a little hasty 
a little premature 
you re right 
it s none of your business 
yes  miss sandra 
there s a locked room upstairs 
what is it 
it was the master bedroom 
why is it locked 
i don t know  miss sandra 
i don t clean it anymore 
i want to see it 
can you open it for me 
i don t have the key 
mr  michael keeps it 
where 
well  i guess it s all right 
he keeps it in his desk 
 february 14  1952 
i think the days in florence   
will be the happiest
i will ever have 
new orleans is a nice town   
and mike is very good to me   
but it is all so different now 
he is busy at work all day   
and sometimes i wonder if mike loves me
as much as his business  
there it is  darling 
isn t it beautiful 
and on the 19th   
it ll be all ours 
it s so big 
and mike  200 guests 
that s a lot of people 
just a small ceremony
would be fine 
no  it s more than a ceremony 
it s a celebration   
and there should be thousands   
and everything s got to be   
very special 
yes  if you say so 
good morning  robert 
  good morning  michael 
  good morning  jane  shirley 
what are you doing here  doc 
this was the only way i had
to get in touch with you 
you re a hard man to get a hold of 
what can i do for you 
i thought we might just sit down
for a while and have a personal talk 
purely a social visit 
why is it psychiatrists
are such lousy liars 
would you come in here  please 
did you all ask dr  ellman up here 
he called to find out how you were 
we thought you might wanna
be talkin  to somebody 
that s fine  thank you 
michael  why don t you
talk to charlie 
  that s fine 
  it s for your own good 
i went by and saw sandra yesterday 
i didn t think you d mind 
you didn t think i d mind 
you invade my privacy
and you ask if i d mind 
will you listen to yourself 
stop and listen to what you re saying 
  can t you see what you re doing 
  i know exactly what i m doing 
i don t want anybody
interfering with my private life 
you re talking with somebody
who already knows you   
knows you better probably
than anybody else 
sandra and i talked about
a lot of things yesterday 
i don t think
you re being fair with her 
you shouldn t marry out
of a sense of guilt   
or out of some morbid preoccupation
with elizabeth 
and now sandra is obsessed
with the idea of elizabeth 
that s all she wanted
to know about yesterday 
she s caught up in your fantasy 
you must know what s happening 
give yourself some time 
let your relationship
with sandra grow first 
and i want you back in therapy 
if not with me  with some other doctor 
but give yourself some time 
right 
except you got it wrong 
we ll talk about it   
after lunch 
good 
we ll work everything out 
just come on down to my office and   
i just don t want you to do anything
impulsively that you ll regret 
bye bye 
what s happening 
  why are you home 
  because you re here 
because my heart s here 
because i never want to leave 
where are you 
we ve been so worried 
look  we re both
really sorry about that 
we didn t mean it 
we only thought you   
okay  he s here 
just a minute 
it s michael 
michael  old boy  where are ya 
well  now  don t you think it s   
now  don t be hasty 
okay  if that s what you want 
he wants us to put his share
of the company into a trust fund 
  he s already sent the papers 
  where is he 
who knows 
  tomorrow

we can have the justice of the peace
perform the ceremony right here 
  why tomorrow

old court 
just can t come up
with the money   
not for elizabeth
and not for you 
mommy 
look at this  this is what
your old man thinks you re worth 
nothing  nothing  nothing 
mommy  mommy 
cut those ropes and let s leave 
break that window open 
don t shoot unless
you want the kid to get it 
it looks like your daddy
doesn t think you re worth a dime 
i m sure your uncle bob will 
i don t want this 
i don t want any part of it 
i don t want this 
i don t want any part of it 
 50 000 is a lot of money
to turn down  darling 
  you keep it  you earned it 
  it wasn t supposed to be like this 
it was a dirty business from the start
and you knew it 
i told you court would either
give up the land   
or be declared mentally incompetent
to manage it 
and you agreed  so don t start getting
an attack of conscience now 
at least you kept him out of bed 
look at it that way 
do you realize what i ve done 
i wanna go back to him 
i wanna confess everything 
i wanna beg him to forgive me 
look  you hold on 
just keep your head a minute 
we just swindled a man
out of millions 
now  the law isn t exactly gonna
look lightly on that   
if you go back to michael
and confess 
you made a dirty deal with me
and you executed it flawlessly 
you re the best investment
i ever made 
old court fell for your elizabeth act
hook  line and sinker 
so now i think you re entitled
to the due wages of sin 
you don t understand 
what am i gonna do now 
it s a little late for
existential questions  darling 
you just take the money  believe you me 
it ll help you to forget 
what am i gonna do 
  i can t take it 
  come on 
look  move 
hurry up 
have you got the money 
  this isn t enough 
  it s all for you 
what about the others 
  they re all dead 
  christ 
smart business deal
this turned out to be 
courtland surprised all of us 
so just take the money
and get out of here 
uncle bob 
where s mommy 
she s dead  honey 
your daddy didn t pay the men   
and they killed her 
you see  i gave the man the money 
i m taking care of you now 
now  you re gonna go with him   
on the plane to a faraway place where
i ve got friends you can live with 
now  i ll be there in about a week
to see if everything s okay 
but where s daddy 
he don t want you anymore  honey 
now you go with the man 
  go on

uncle bob

i know there can be none 
i was never killed with mother 
i was ransomed by la salle
and brought to florence   
where i lived with mrs  portinari 
i was raised believing
you killed mother 
i hated you  i lived for the day
when i could revenge her 
then la salle came to me with his plan
to swindle the land from you   
and i got my chance 
but you were not like he said 
i never thought i would   
iove you 
ladies and gentlemen  we are sorry
to disturb you at this time   
but we have just encountered
some unexpected turbulence 
would you please return to your seats
immediately and   
excuse me 
it wasn t there 
the money wasn t there 
it wasn t there 
you got me out of bed   
forced me to give you  500 000 
you were actin  crazy 
of course the money wasn t there 
i had to protect it from you 
i have the real money 
i was only lookin  after
your own good 
it s all yours now 
and this will surely keep you
from throwin  it away 
i killed her 
she came back a second time   
to let me prove i loved her   
and i killed her 
now she s gone 
you just can t seem
to keep a woman  can you 
you self righteous son of a bitch 
what did you think
you were anyway 
steppin  on anybody you wanted to   
tellin  people what to do
and when to do it 
sittin  on your ass   
while a fortune slipped
through our fingers 
do you know how rich
we could have been 
but you don t care
about money  do ya 
you never did 
you just threw away millions this
mornin  for that lyin  little bitch 
go ahead and kill me

she was in it with me  you fool 
she was in it from the start
