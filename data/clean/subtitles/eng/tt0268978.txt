thejapanese codes   
and built the a bomb 
mathematicians   
like you 
the stated goal of the soviets
is global communism 
in medicine
or economics 
in technology or space 
battle lines are being drawn 
to triumph  we need results 
publishable  applicable results

will be the next morse 
the next einstein 
who among you will be
the vanguard
of democracy  freedom

today  we bequeath
america s future

welcome to princeton  gentlemen 
man 
it s not enough hansen won
the carnegie scholarship 
man  2 
no  he has to have it
all for himself 
it s the first time
the carnegie prize
has been split 
hansen s all bent 
man  2 
rumor is he s got his sights
set on wheeler lab 
the new military
think tank at m i t 
they re only taking
one this year 
hansen s used
to being picked first 
oh  yeah 
he s wasted on math 
he should be running
for president 
there could be
a mathematical explanation
for how bad your tie is 
 laughs 
thank you 
neilson  symbol cryptography 
neils here broke a jap code 
helped rid the world of fascism 
at least that s what
he tells the girls  eh  neils 
the name s bender 
atomic physics 
  and you are 
  am i late 
  yes 
  yes  mr  sol 
oh  good 
uh  hi 
  sol  richard sol 
  neilson  the burden of genius 
  bender  there he is 
  so many supplicants 
and so little time 
  mr  sol 
  how are you  sir 
  ah  bender 
  nice to see you 
  congratulations  mr  hansen 
  ah  thank you 
i ll take another 
excuse me 
a thousand pardons 
i simply assumed you
were the waiter 
  play nice  hansen 
  nice is not hansen s
strong suit 
hansen 
honest mistake 
well  martin hansen 
it is martin  isn t it 
why  yes  john  it is 
i imagine you re getting
quite used to miscalculation 
i ve read your pre prints   
both of them 
the one on nazi ciphers 
and the other one
on non linear equations 
and i am supremely confident
that there is not
a single seminal
or innovative idea
in either one of them 
enjoy your punch 
 chuckles 
gentlemen  meetjohn nash 
the mysterious
west virginia genius 
the other winner of
the distinguished carnegie scholarship 
  bender  oh  okay 
  sol  oh  yeah

roommate 
oh  god  no 
  ugh 
   music slows  stops 
did you know that having
a hangover is   
is not having enough water
in your body
to run your krebs cycles 
which is exactly
what happens to you
when you re dying
of thirst 
so  dying
of thirst   
would probably feel
pretty much like
the hangover
that finally
bloody kills you 
 chuckles 
john nash 
hello 
charles herman 
pleased to meet you 
player 
all right 
well done 
charles 
well  it s official 
i m almost human again 
officer  i saw
the driver who hit me 
his name was johnny walker 
 mimics rimshot 
whew 
well  i got in last night
in time for   
english department
cocktails 
cock was mine 
the tail belonged
to a particularly lovely
young thing
with a passion
for   
d h  lawrence 
you re not easily
distracted  are you 
  i m here to work 
  hmmm  are you  right 
i see 
crikey 
is my roommate a dick 
hmm 
listen 
if we can t break the ice   
how about we drown it 
so what s your story 
you the poor kid
that never got to go
to exeter or andover 
despite my privileged
upbringing 
i m actually
quite well balanced 
i have a chip
on both shoulders 
 chuckles 
maybe you re just better
with the old integers
than you are with people 
my first grade teacher 
she told me
that i was born
with two helpings of brain 
but only half
a helping of heart 
 chuckles 
wow  she sounds lovely 
the truth is that l   
i don t like people much 
and they don t much like me 
but why 
with all your obvious
wit and charm 
 laughs 
seriously  john 
mathematics   
mathematics is
never going to lead you
to a higher truth 
and you know why 
 cause it s boring 
it s really boring 
 chuckles 
you know half these schoolboys
are already published 
i cannot waste time
with these classes   
and these books 
 coughs 
memorizing
the weaker assumptions
of lesser mortals 
 chuckles 
i need to look through   
to the governing dynamics 
find a truly original idea 
that s the only way
i ll ever distinguish myself 
it s the only way
that i ll ever   
matter 
yes 
hansen 
all right  who s next 
no  i ve played enough  go 
for one day  thank you 
  come on 
  l    i hate this game 
cowards  all of you 
none of you rise
to meet my challenge 
come on  bender 
whoever wins 
sol does his laundry
all semester 
  does that seem unfair
to anyone else 
  not at all 
  bender  look at him 
  nash 
taking a reverse
constitutional 
i m hoping to extract
an algorithm
to define
their movement 
  oh 
  psycho 
sol 
hey  nash  i thought
you dropped out 
you ever going
to go to class or   
classes will dull your mind 
destroy the potential
for authentic creativity 
oh  oh  i didn t
know that 
nash is going to stun us all
with his genius 
which is another way
of saying
he doesn t have
the nerve to compete 
you scared 
terrified 
mortified 
petrified 
stupefied    by you 
no starch 
pressed and folded 
let me ask
you something  john 
be my guest  martin 
bender and sol here
correctly completed
allen s proof
of peyrot s conjecture 
adequate work   
without innovation 
oh  i m flattered 
you flattered 
flattered 
and i ve got
two weapons briefs
under security review
by the d o d 
derivative drivel 
but nash achievements 
zero 
i m a patient man  martin 
is there an actual
question coming 
what if you never come up
with your original idea 
huh 
how will it feel
when i m chosen for wheeler   
and you re not 
what if you lose 
bender 
ah  there it is 
 chuckles 
you should not have won 
hmmm 
i had the first move 
my    my play was perfect 
the hubris
of the defeated 
the game is flawed 
gentlemen 
the greatjohn nash 
charles 
you ve been in here
for two days 
you know hansen s
just published another paper 
i can t even find a topic
for my doctorate 
well  on the bright side 
you ve invented window art 
this is a group
playing touch football 
this is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over bread crumbs 
and this here is a woman
who is chasing a man
who stole her purse 
john  you watched
a mugging 
that s weird 
in competitive behavior
someone always loses 
well  my niece knows that 
john  and she s about this high 
see  if i could derive
an equilibrium
where prevalence is
a non singular event 
where nobody loses 
can you imagine the effect
that would have
  on conflict scenarios 
and arms negotiations   
  when did you last eat 
  when did you last eat 
   currency exchange 
you know  food 
you have no respect
for cognitive reverie 
you know that 
yes  but pizza   
now  pizza i have
enormous respect for 
and of course beer 
i have respect for beer 
i have respect for beer 
  bender  good evening  neils 
  hansen  hey  nash 
who s winning 
you or you 
  bender  evening  nash 
  sol  hey  guys 
hey  nash 
woman 
he s looking
at you for sure 
hey  nash 
neils is trying
to get your attention 
  bender  you re joking 
  sol  oh  no 
  go with god 
  come back a man 
  fortune favors the brave 
  bombs away 
gentlemen  might i remind you
that my odds of success
dramatically improve
with each attempt 
this is going
to be classic 
maybe you want
to buy me a drink 
i don t exactly know
what i m required to say
in order for you
to have intercourse with me 
but could we assume
that i said all that 
essentially we re talking
about fluid exchange  right 
so  could we just
go straight to the sex 
oh  that was sweet 
have a nice night 
asshole 
   man laughs 
  neilson  ladies  wait 
charles  l   
i especially liked
the bit about fluid exchange 
it was really charming 
professor 
walk with me  john 
i ve been meaning
to talk with you 
the faculty is completing
mid year reviews 
we re deciding which placement
applications to support 
wheeler  sir 
that would be
my first choice 
and actually 
i don t really have
a second choice  sir 
john  your fellows
have attended classes 
they ve written papers 
they ve published 
i m still searching  sir 
for my   
  your original idea  i know 
  governing dynamics  sir 
it s very clever  john 
but i m afraid
it s just not nearly
good enough 
  may i 
  thank you 
i ve been working
on manifold embedding 
my bargaining stratagems
are starting to show
some promise 
if you could just
arrange another meeting 
if you d be kind enough 
with professor einstein   
  i ve repeatedly asked
you for that 
  now  john 
i d be able to show him
my revisions on his   
john 
do you see what they re
doing in there 
  professor  congratulations 
  max  thank you so much 
congratulations 
professor max 
  max  thank you  sir 
  thank you 
it s the pens 
reserved for a member
of the department
that makes the achievement
of a lifetime 
now  what do you see  john 
recognition 
well done  professor 
well done 
well  try seeing
accomplishment 
is there a difference 
john 
you haven t focused 
i m sorry 
but up to this point 
your record doesn t warrant
any placement at all 
good day 
and my compliments
to you  sir 
thank you so much 
i can t see it 
 whimpers 
  aah 
  jesus christ  john 
i can t fail 
  this is all i am 
  come on  let s go out 
  i got to get
something done 
  john 
  i can t keep
staring into space 
  john  enough 
got to face the wall 
follow their rules 
read their books   
you want to do
some damage  fine   
  but don t mess around 
   do their classes 
come on 
go on  bust your head 
kill yourself 
john  do it 
don t mess around 
bust your head 
go on 
bust that worthless head
wide open 
goddamn it  charles 
what the hell is
your problem  
it s not my problem 
and it s not your problem 
it s their problem 
your answer isn t
face the wall 
it s out there   
where you ve been working 
   panting 
   gasps 
that was heavy 
that isaac newton fellow
was right 
  he was onto something 
  clever boy 
 giggles 
john 
don t worry  that s mine 
i ll come and get it
in a minute 
   both laughing 
  oh  god 
  neilson  incoming  gentlemen 
  sol  ay yi yi 
 sighs 
deep breaths 
sol  nash  you might
want to stop
shuffling your papers
for five seconds 
i will not buy
you gentlemen beer 
bender 
oh  we re not here
for beer  my friend 
  john  oh 
   sol chuckles 
does anyone else feel she should be
moving in slow motion 
will she want
a large wedding  ya think 
shall we say swords  gentlemen 
  pistols at dawn 
  have you remembered nothing 
recall the lessons
of adam smith 
the father
of modern economics 
 in competition   
sol and neilson 
individual ambition
serves the common good  
  exactly 
  every man for himself 
gentlemen 
bender 
and those who strike out
are stuck with her friends 
hansen 
i m not gonna strike out 
sol 
you can lead a blonde to water 
but you can t make her drink 
  i don t think he said that 
  sol  nobody move   
she s looking over here 
she s looking at nash 
hansen 
oh  god  he may have
the upper hand now 
but wait until he
opens his mouth 
   laughing 
  remember the last time 
bender 
oh  yes  that was one
for the history books 
adam smith needs revision 
what are you
talking about 
if we all go for the blonde   
we block each other 
not a single one of us
is gonna get her 
so then we go
for her friends 
but they will all
give us the cold shoulder
because nobody likes
to be second choice 
well  what if no one goes
for the blonde 
we don t get
in each other s way 
and we don t insult
the other girls 
that s the only way we win 
that s the only
way we all get laid 
 laughs 
adam smith said
the best result comes
from everyone
in the group doing
what s best
for himself  right 
that s what he
said  right 
  right 
  incomplete 
incomplete  okay 
because the best result
will come   
from everyone in the group
doing what s best for himself   
and the group 
nash  if this is some way
for you to get the blonde
on your own 
  you can go to hell 
  governing dynamics 
governing dynamics 
adam smith   
was wrong 
  sol  oh  here we go 
  neilson  careful  careful 
thank you 
 c  of s  equals
 c  of t  
 muttering 
you do realize this
flies in the face
  of a 1 50 years
of economic theory 
  yes  i do  sir 
that s rather presumptuous 
don t you think 
it is  sir 
 stifled laugh 
well  mr  nash 
with a breakthrough
of this magnitude 
i m confident you will get
any placement you like 
wheeler labs 
they ll ask you to recommend
two team members 
 whispering 
yes 
stills and frank
are excellent choices 
sol and bender  sir 
sol and bender are
extraordinary mathematicians 
has it occurred to you
that sol and bender
might have plans
of their own 
 laughing 
  baby 
  wheeler  we made it 
  cheers  cheers  cheers 
  to    oh  oh 
okay  awkward moment 
gentlemen 
umm   
hmm

dr  john nash 
glad you could
come  doctor 
hello 
right this way 
we ve been intercepting

the computer can t
detect a pattern 
but i m sure it s code 
john 
why is that  general 
ever just know
something  dr  nash 
constantly

thank you 
captain 
dr  nash  follow me  please 
man on radio 
none of those who have

they could use
that would be effective

all right 
wheeler defense labs
mit campus
  thank you  sir 
  home run at the pentagon 
have they actually
taken the word  classified 
out of the dictionary 
oh  hi 
the air conditioning broke again 
how am i supposed to be
in here saving the world
  if i m melting 
  our hearts go out to you 
you know  two trips
to the pentagon in four years 
that s two more than we ve had 
it gets better  john 
just got our latest
scintillating assignment 
you know  the russians
have the h bomb 
the nazis are repatriating
south america 
the chinese have
a standing army of 2 8 million 
and i am doing
stress tests on a dam 
you made the cover
of fortune    again 
please note the use
of the word  you   not  we  
that was supposed
to be just me 
oh 
 laughs 
so not only do they rob me
of the fields medal 
now they put me on the cover
of fortune magazine
with these hacks 
these scholars of trivia 
john  exactly what s
the difference
between genius
and most genius 
quite a lot 
he s your son 
anyway  you ve got 1 0 minutes 
i ve always got 1 0 minutes 
sol 
before your new class 
can i not get a note
from a doctor or something 
you are a doctor  john 
and no 
now  come on 
you know the drill 
we get these
beautiful facilities 
m i t  gets america s
great minds of today
teaching america s
great minds of tomorrow 
poor bastards 
now  have a nice day at school 
the bell s ringing 
 door opens 
the eager young minds
of tomorrow 
 loudjackhammering 
can we leave one open 
professor 
it s really hot  sir 
your comfort comes second
to my ability
to hear my own voice 
personally 
i think this class
will be a waste   
of your   
and what is infinitely worse   
my time 
however  here we are 
so you may attend or not 
you may complete
your assignments at your whim 
we have begun 
miss 
excuse me 
  excuse me 
  hey  hey 
hi 
um  we have
a little problem 
it s extremely hot in here
with the windows closed
and extremely noisy
with them open 
so  i was wondering
if there was any way you could 
i don t know 
maybe work someplace else
for about 45 minutes 
  worker  not a problem 
  thank you so much 
  at a break 
  got it 
worker 
let s go  let s clean it
a little bit 
as you will find
in multivariable calculus 
there is often   
a number of solutions
for any given problem 
as i was saying 
this problem here
will take some of you
many months to solve 
for others among you 
it will take you the term
of your natural lives 
man 
professor nash 
william parcher 
big brother 
at your service 
what can i do
for the department of defense 
are you going to
to give me a raise 
let s take a walk 
  impressive work
at the pentagon 
  yes  it was 
oppenheimer used to say 
 genius sees the answer
before the question  
you knew oppenheimer 
his project was
under my supervision 
which project 
that project 
it s not that simple 
you know 
well  you ended the war 
we incinerated 1 50 000 people
in a heartbeat 
great deeds come
at great cost  mr  parcher 
well  conviction 
it turns out 
is a luxury of those
on the sidelines  mr  nash 
i ll try
and keep that in mind 
so  john  no family 
no close friends   
why is that 
john 
i like to think it s
because i m a lone wolf 
but mainly it s because
people don t like me 
 chuckles 
well  there are
certain endeavors
where your lack
of personal connection
would be considered
an advantage 
  this is a secure area 
  they know me 
have you ever
been here 
we were told during
our initial briefing
that these warehouses
were abandoned 
that s not precisely accurate 
 low radio chatter 
 tapes screeching 
 sirens 
man speaking russian 
by telling you
what i m about to tell you 
i am increasing
your security clearance
to top secret 
disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment 
get it 
what operation 
those are a good idea 
this factory is in berlin 
we seized it
at the end of the war 
nazi engineers were attempting
to build a portable atomic bomb 
the soviets reached
this facility before we did 
and we lost the damn thing 
the routing orders
at the pentagon 
they were about this 
weren t they 
the soviets aren t
as unified as people believe 
a faction of the red army
calling itself novaya svobga 
 the new freedom  
has control of the bomb
and intends to detonate it
on u s  soil 
their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties 
parcher 
man is capable
of as much atrocity
as he has imagination 
new freedom has sleeper agents
here in the u s 
mccarthy is an idiot 
but unfortunately
that doesn t make him wrong 
new freedom communicates
to its agents
through codes imbedded
in newspapers and magazines 
and that s where you come in 
you see  john 
what distinguishes you
is that you are 
quite simply 
the best natural code breaker
i have ever seen 
what exactly is it
that you would like me to do 
commit this list
of periodicals to memory 
scan each new issue 
find any hidden codes 
decipher them 
doctor 
place your chin
on the chin rest 
  stare into the light 
  man  pulse 88  regular 
okay  this may be
a little uncomfortable 
 groans 
that s got
a little zap to it  doesn t it 
he just implanted
a radium diode 
don t worry  it s safe 
the isotope decays predictably 
as a result 
these numbers change over time 
they re the access codes
to your drop spot 
so what am i now  a spy 
   knocking 
  come 
boy  you must be
really important 
it s all right  mike 
what are you working on 
classified 
everyone waited
half an hour 
for 
class 
you missed class today 
oh  i suspect that   
nobody missed me 
 chuckles 
the problem that you left
on the board   
i solved it 
oh  no you didn t 
you didn t even look 
i never said
that the vector fields
were rational functions 
your solution is elegant 
though on this
particular occasion 
ultimately incorrect 
you re still here 
i m still here 
why 
i m wondering  professor nash 
if i can ask you
to dinner 
you do eat  don t you 
oh  on occasion  yeah 
 chuckles 
table for one  prometheus alone
chained to the rock
with the bird circling overhead 
you know how it is 
 laughs 
no  i expect
that you wouldn t   
you wouldn t know 
if you leave your address
with my office 
i ll pick you up
friday at 8 00
and we ll eat 
one more thing 
do you have a name 
or should i just
keep calling you  miss  
governor 
may i present   
  miss alicia larde 
  miss alicia larde 
  how do you do 
  professor  please 
you and the governor 
wait  one second  i m sorry 
i want a copy of this 
first big date and all 
you know 
so  you boys need
to look good 
which is not a state
you find yourselves in
altogether naturally 
there  better 
  i m surprising him 
  you just keep on surprising him 
professor 
god must be a painter 
why else would we
have so many colors 
so you re a painter 
that s not actually
what i said 
but  yes   
i am 
here 
me 
your date 
practice human interaction
and social comportment 
that s a plan 
champagne would be lovely 
i ll be outside 
i will get the champagne 
oh  thank you 
thank you for that 
no  keep it 
i believe in deciding things
will be good luck 
do you 
no 
i don t believe in luck 
but i do believe
in assigning value to things 
oh 
i once tried
to count them all 
i actually made it to 4 348 
you are exceptionally odd 
i bet you re very
popular with the girls 
a pair of odd ducks  then 
mmm 
pick a shape 
what 
pick a shape 
an animal    anything 
okay 
an umbrella 
do it again 
 chuckles 
  do it again 
  all right 
  what would you like 
  do  uh   
an octopus 
 dog barking 
 alicia chuckles 
alicia 
you don t talk much  do you 
i can t talk to you
about my work  alicia 
i don t mean work 
i find that polishing
my interactions
in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort 
i have a tendency to expedite
information flow   
by being direct 
i often don t get
a pleasant result 
try me 
all right 
i find you attractive 
your aggressive
moves towards me
indicate that you
feel the same way 
but still 
ritual requires that we
continue with a number
of platonic activities
before we have sex 
i am proceeding
with those activities 
but in point of actual fact 
all i really want to do
is have intercourse with you
as soon as possible 
are you gonna slap me now 
how was that result 
girl 
what are you doing 
i m attempting to isolate
patterned re occurrences
within periodicals
over time    and you 
you talk funny  mr  nash 
do i know you 
my uncle says you re very smart
but not very nice 
so i shouldn t pay no mind
if you re mean to me 
and who might
your uncle be 
the prodigal roommate   
returns 
 chuckles

the refractive faces

empirical data

to redefine
my girlish notions of romance 
a proof 
verifiable data 
um    okay

all the data indicate it 
  but it hasn t been proven yet

well  now you tell me 
what is it 
woman 
professor nash 
welcome 
after 
john 
so  we see that
the    the zeroes 
of the reimann
zeta function 
correspond
to singularities
in space time 
singularities
in space time   
and conventional
number theory   
it breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration 
sometimes our expectations
are betrayed
by the numbers 
variables are impossible
to assign any   
rational value

alicia 
what s wrong with him 
john has schizophrenia 
people with this disorder
are often paranoid 
but    but his work 
he deals with conspiracies   
yes  yes  i know 
in john s world  these behaviors
are    accepted 
encouraged 
as such  his illness
may have gone untreated
far longer than is typical 
what do you mean 
how long 
possibly since
graduate school 
at least that s when
his hallucinations
seem to have begun 
what are you talking about 
what hallucinations 
one  so far 
that i am aware of 
an imaginary roommate
named charles herman 
charles isn t imaginary 
he and john have been
best friends since princeton 
have you ever met charles 
has he ever come to dinner 
he s always in town
for so little time  lecturing 
  was he at your wedding 
  he had to teach 
have you ever
seen a picture of him 
  talked to him
on the telephone 
  this is ridiculous 
i phoned princeton 
according to their
housing records 
john lived alone 
now  which is more likely   
that your husband 
a mathematician
with no military training 
is a government spy
fleeing the russians   
you re making him sound crazy 
   or  that he has
lost his grip on reality 
now the only way
i can help him
is to show him
the difference
between what s real
and what is in his mind 
come on 
what s he been working on 
his work is classified 
he mentioned a supervisor
by the name
of william parcher 
maybe mr  parcher
can clarify things for us 
but i can t get to him
without clearances 
you want me to help you get
the details of my husband s work 
john thinks i m a russian spy 
is that what you think 
  what did the doctor say 
  is he sick 
i don t know 
i want to see whatjohn s
been working on 
  you know you can t
go in his office 
  it s classified  alicia 
stop  oh 
oh  my god 
oh  my god 
why didn t you
say something 
alicia  john s always been
a little weird 
he said he was
doing code breaking 
that it was eyes only 
  top secret  part
of the military effort 
  was he 
well  it was possible 
you know 
directives come down
all the time
that some of us
aren t cleared for 
  it was possible 
  possible  but   
not likely 
lately  he d become
so much more agitated
and then when you called   
so  is this all
he s been doing every day 
cutting out magazines 
well  not all 
 door opens 
  alicia  i m so sorry 
  john  it s okay 
  i missed you 
  i missed you 
i have to talk to you 
okay 
alicia  i ve been
thinking about it 
and i do realize
that my behavior
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you
must have appeared insane 
i left you with no other choice 
i do understand   
  and i m truly sorry 
  that s okay 
everything s gonna be all right 
everything s gonna be all right 
we just have to talk quietly 
they may be listening 
there may be microphones 
i m gonna tell you
everything now 
it s breaking with protocol
but you need to know 
because you have to help me
get out of here 
i ve been doing top secret work
for the government 
there s a threat that exists
of catastrophic proportions 
i think the russians
feel my profile is too high 
that s why they simply
just don t do away with me 
they re keeping me here
to try to stop me
from doing my work 
you have to get to wheeler 
  you have to find
william parcher 
  stop 
  he can help us 
  stop  stop  stop 
i went to wheeler 
good  good 
there is no william parcher 
of course there is 
  i ve been working for him 
  doing what 
breaking codes 
dropping packages
in a secret mailbox
for the government to pick up 
how could you know that 
sol followed you 
  he thought it was harmless 
  sol followed me 
they ve never been opened 
it isn t real 
there is no conspiracy  john 
there is no william parcher 
it s in your mind 
do you understand  baby 
you re sick 
you re sick  john

you see  the nightmare
of schizophrenia
is not knowing what s true 
imagine   
if you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places
and the moments
most important to you
were not gone  not dead 
but worse   
had never been 
what kind of hell
would that be 
administering insulin

1 year later
alicia 
john always spoke so fondly
of being here at princeton 
and hansen is running
the department now 
so he keeps reminding us 
and reminding us 
 laughs 
yeah 
john won t come near
the campus  though 
  i think he s ashamed 
   baby cries 
hey  hey 
want this 
so  alicia  how   
how are you holding up 
well  the delusions have passed 
they re saying
with the medication
and low stress environment   
no  l    i mean 
how are you 
i think often what i feel
is obligation 
or guilt over wanting to leave 
rage againstjohn 
against god and   
but   
then i look at him
and i force myself to see
the man that i married 
and he becomes that man 
he s transformed
into someone that i love 
and i m transformed
into someone who loves him 
it s not all the time 
but   
it s enough 
i thinkjohn is
a very lucky man   
alicia 
so unlucky 
  alicia  this is us 
  sol  this is it 
  it s nice 
  it s near where i work 
alicia

he really wanted
to stop by and you know  see you 
you know  say hi 
squeamish 
yeah 
i suppose i would be  too 
but alas  i m stuck with me 
  i m trying to solve
the reimann hypothesis 
  uh huh 
oh  yeah 
i figured if   
if i dazzle them 
they will have
to reinstate me 
but it s difficult
with the medication 
because it s hard to   
see the solution 
you know  john 
you should go easy 
there are other
things besides   
besides work 
what are they 
 baby crying 
shh hh

 schizophrenic break

psychological bullshit 
look at me  john 
john  look at me

he s been injected
with a cloaking serum 
i can see him
because of a chemical
that was released
into my bloodstream
when my implant

i couldn t tell you 
it was for your own protection 
alicia 
  no 
  hello  i need
dr  rosen s office  please

i understand 
 engine starts 
 screams 
she never gets old 
marcee can t be real 
she never gets old 
you see them now 
yes 
why did you
stop your meds 
because i couldn t do my work 
i couldn t help
with the baby 
i couldn t   
i couldn t respond to my wife 
you think that s better
than being crazy 
we ll need to start you
on a higher run
of insulin shocks
and a new medication 
no 
there has
to be another way 
dr  rosen 
schizophrenia is degenerative 
some days may be
symptom free 
but over time 
you are getting worse 
it s a problem  that s all it is 
it s a problem with no solution 
and that s what i do 
i solve problems 
  that s what i do best 
  this isn t math 
dr  rosen 
you can t come up
with a formula
to change the way
you experience the world 
  all i have to do
is apply my mind 
  there s no theorem  no proof 
  you can t reason
your way out of this 
  why not  why can t i 
because your mind
is where the problem is
in the first place 
i can do this 
i can work it out 
all i need is time 
is that the baby 
the baby s
at my mother s  john 
 marcee humming 
dr  rosen 
without treatment  john 
the fantasies
may take over   
entirely 
alicia 
you almost ready 
rosen s waiting outside 
i can t go back
to that hospital 
i won t come home 
he said that
if you said that 
he has commitment
papers for me to sign 
well  maybe you
won t sign them 
maybe you ll just
give me some time 
i will try to figure this out 
whatever you do 
rosen is right
about one thing 
you shouldn t be here 
i m not safe anymore 
would you have hurt me  john 
i don t know 
maybe you should let
dr  rosen drive you to your mother s 
 muffled voices 
 car doors close 
 engine starts 
 car departs 
 footsteps on stairs 
rosen said to call if you try
and kill me or anything 
you want to know what s real 
this 
this 
this 
this is real 
maybe the part   
that knows the waking
from the dream 
maybe it isn t here 
maybe it s here 
i need to believe
that something
extraordinary is possible

that you could ignore
what i just did 
of course 
what are old friends for 
is that what we are  martin 
friends 
john  of course 
of course 
we always have been 
alicia and i think that   
that fitting in 
being part of a community 
might do me some good 
that a certain level of attachment 
familiar places  familiar people 
might help me   
elbow out these   
these certain delusions that i have 
it s a lot to ask 
and now that i m here 
i m quite certain
that you will just say no 
but i was wondering
if i could hang around 
 sighs 
huh 
will you be needing an office 
no 
no  i could just work
out of the library 
well  this guy tries
to wander into the library 
  but he doesn t have i d 
  why can t people read
their memos  huh

for noncommutative extensions 
 chuckles 
yes  it is 
but it only appears
to work sporadically  so  no 
but   
i believe i m
making progress 
you re   
you rejohn nash  right 
  toby kelly 
  hello 
i ve been studying
your equilibrium 
the one you wrote here 
at princeton 
to come up with something
totally original  the way you did   
you know  i was young 
 chuckles 
umm   
i ve been developing a theory 
i believe i can prove
that galois extensions
are covering spaces 
that everything 
everything is connected 
that it s all part
of the same subject 
when was the last time
you ate 
  excuse me 
  you know  food 
oh  uh   
my wife 
she loves mayonnaise 
oh  thank you 
thank you 
go on 
the function   
  is in the two categories 
  um hmm

   coming together
at maximum speed of   
let us say
1 0 miles per hour 
so you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle b 
and the fly  who can travel
at 20 miles an hour 
leaves the tire
of bicycle b and it flies
to the tire of bicycle a
and backwards and forwards
and so on and so forth
until the two bikes collide
and the poor little fly
is squashed 
   chuckling 
  this is the important thing
about actually focusing in
and comprehending
the area that you re
dealing with 
mathematics is very specific 
and it is an art form 
no matter what these people
around here will tell you 
especially the people from biology 
don t listen to any
of those people 
let me go back
to what you were doing before 
i might want to steal this 
write a book and get famous 
i was thinking
that i might teach 
a classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone 
john  besides 
you re a terrible teacher 
i m an acquired
taste  martin 
i was hoping there still
might be something
i could contribute 
what about the   
well  you know 
are they gone 
no  they re not gone 
and maybe they
never will be 
but i ve gotten used
to ignoring them
and i think as a result
they ve kind of given up on me 
you think that s what it s like
with all our dreams
and our nightmares  martin 
you ve got to keep feeding them
for them to stay alive 
john  they   
haunt you  though 
they re my past  martin 
everybody s haunted by their past 
well  good bye 
john  i ll talk
to the department 
maybe in the spring 
hey  nash 
you   
you scared 
terrified 
mortified 
petrified 
stupefied by you 
now you ought best ring alicia 
  or you re gonna get me   
  i ll ring her 
   in an awful
lot of trouble 
  thanks  professor 
  good bye 
  have a nice day 
  good bye 
papers in hand  mr  beyer

professor nash 
  can you see him 
  yeah 
  you sure 
  uh huh 
positive 
he s within your vision 
   laughing 
  okay  good 
forgive me  i m just
always suspicious of new people 
  see you next week  professor 
  see you next week 
so now that i know
that you re real 
who are you  and what can
i do for you 
professor  my name
is thomas king   
  thomas king 
  mmm hm 
   and i m here
to tell you
that you re being considered
for the nobel prize 
john 
forgive me  but i m just
a little stunned 
king 
over the past few years
your equilibrium
has become a cornerstone
of modern economics 
suddenly everybody
likes that one 
what about my work
on other some such projects   
manifold embedding 
the application
of your bargaining problem
to f c c  bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases   
  antitrust cases 
  yes 
i never would have
considered that 
  well   
  have i just reached
some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity 
 laughs 
no  no  you haven t 
 cause  i wouldn t
have thought of that 
shall we have tea 
oh  i don t go in there 
i usually just
take my sandwich
in the library 
come on  john 
let s have some tea 
it s a big day 
m most   
most commercially
available brands of tea
are not suitable to my palate 
i m not   
there are some
northern indian teas
which are dense enough   
i enjoy the flavor
that they have   
i have not been in this room
for some many years 
i wonder what tea they serve 
john 
why  thank you  young lady 
things have certainly
changed around here 
i have a son that age 
  harvard 
   king chuckles 
hmm 
i would have thought
the nominations
for the nobel prize
would have been secret 
i would have thought
you d only find out
if you won or lost 
that is generally
the case  yes 
but these are
special circumstances 
the awards are substantial 
they require private funding 
as such 
the image of the nobel is   
i see  you came here
to find out if i was crazy 
find out if i would
screw everything up
if i actually won 
dance around the podium 
strip naked and squawk
like a chicken 
things of this nature 
something like that  yes 
would i embarrass you 
yes  it is possible 
you see  l   
i am crazy 
i take the newer medications 
but i still see things
that are not here 
i just choose
not to acknowledge them 
like a diet of the mind 
i choose not to indulge
certain appetites 
like my appetite for patterns 
perhaps my appetite
to imagine and to dream 
man 
professor nash 
it s good to have
you here  john 
thank you 
  it s an honor  sir 
  thank you very much 
a privilege  professor 
professor 
  nicely done  john 
  thank you  tom 
thank you 
thank you 
thank you  ed 
that was certainly most unexpected

john 
thank you 
 applause fades 
i ve always believed in numbers 
in the equations and logics
that lead to reason 
but after a lifetime
of such pursuits 
i ask 
what truly is logic 
who decides reason 
my quest has taken me
through the physical 
the metaphysical 
the delusional 
and back 
and i have made the most important
discovery of my career 
the most important discovery
of my life 
it is only in the mysterious
equations of love
that any logical
reasons can be found 
i m only here tonight
because of you 
you are the reason i am 
you are all my reasons 
thank you 
john 
so nice to have met you 
i ll call for the car  dad 
bye bye 
woman 
bye bye 
  are you ready to go now 
  oh  yes  i am 
yes  indeed 
and yes  please 
thank you so much 
thank you 
what is it  what s wrong 
nothing 
nothing at all 
  come with me  young lady 
  oh hh   
i have a car outside 
are you interested in a ride 
 nash s theories have influenced
global trade negotiations    
where s it going to 
 national labor relations  and even
breakthroughs in evolutionary biology

i will 
 watch you 
in the darkness 
show you

 when the bad dreams 
 wake you crying 
i show you
