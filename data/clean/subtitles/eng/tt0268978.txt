won the war
mathematicians broke
thejapanese codes
and built the abomb
mathematicians
like you
the stated goal of the soviets
is global communism
in medicine
or economics
in technology or space
battle lines are being drawn
to triumph we need results
publishable applicable results
now who among you
will be the next morse
the next einstein
who among you will be
the vanguard
of democracy freedom
and discovery
today we bequeath
americas future
into your able hands
welcome to princeton gentlemen
man
its not enough hansen won
the carnegie scholarship
man 2
no he has to have it
all for himself
its the first time
the carnegie prize
has been split
hansens all bent
man 2
rumor is hes got his sights
set on wheeler lab
the new military
think tank at mit
theyre only taking
one this year
hansens used
to being picked first
oh yeah
hes wasted on math
he should be running
for president
there could be
a mathematical explanation
for how bad your tie is
laughs
thank you
neilson symbol cryptography
neils here broke a jap code
helped rid the world of fascism
at least thats what
he tells the girls eh neils
the names bender
atomic physics
and you are
am i late
yes
yes mr sol
oh good
uh hi
sol richard sol
neilson the burden of genius
bender there he is
so many supplicants
and so little time
mr sol
how are you sir
ah bender
nice to see you
congratulations mr hansen
ah thank you
ill take another
excuse me
a thousand pardons
i simply assumed you
were the waiter
play nice hansen
nice is not hansens
strong suit
hansen
honest mistake
well martin hansen
it is martin isnt it
why yes john it is
i imagine youre getting
quite used to miscalculation
ive read your preprints
both of them
the one on nazi ciphers
and the other one
on nonlinear equations
and i am supremely confident
that there is not
a single seminal
or innovative idea
in either one of them
enjoy your punch
chuckles
gentlemen meetjohn nash
the mysterious
west virginia genius
the other winner of
the distinguished carnegie scholarship
bender oh okay
sol oh yeah
bender
of course
choral record playing
coughs
oh christ
the prodigal
roommate arrives
roommate
oh god no
ugh
music slows stops
did you know that having
a hangover is
is not having enough water
in your body
to run your krebs cycles
which is exactly
what happens to you
when youre dying
of thirst
so dying
of thirst
would probably feel
pretty much like
the hangover
that finally
bloody kills you
chuckles
john nash
hello
charles herman
pleased to meet you
player
all right
well done
charles
well its official
im almost human again
officer i saw
the driver who hit me
his name was johnny walker
mimics rimshot
whew
well i got in last night
in time for
english department
cocktails
cock was mine
the tail belonged
to a particularly lovely
young thing
with a passion
for
dh lawrence
youre not easily
distracted are you
im here to work
hmmm are you right
i see
crikey
is my roommate a dick
hmm
listen
if we cant break the ice
how about we drown it
so whats your story
you the poor kid
that never got to go
to exeter or andover
despite my privileged
upbringing
im actually
quite wellbalanced
i have a chip
on both shoulders
chuckles
maybe youre just better
with the old integers
than you are with people
my first grade teacher
she told me
that i was born
with two helpings of brain
but only half
a helping of heart
chuckles
wow she sounds lovely
the truth is that l
i dont like people much
and they dont much like me
but why
with all your obvious
wit and charm
laughs
seriously john
mathematics
mathematics is
never going to lead you
to a higher truth
and you know why
cause its boring
its really boring
chuckles
you know half these schoolboys
are already published
i cannot waste time
with these classes
and these books
coughs
memorizing
the weaker assumptions
of lesser mortals
chuckles
i need to look through
to the governing dynamics
find a truly original idea
thats the only way
ill ever distinguish myself
its the only way
that ill ever
matter
yes
hansen
all right whos next
no ive played enough go
for one day thank you
come on
l i hate this game
cowards all of you
none of you rise
to meet my challenge
come on bender
whoever wins
sol does his laundry
all semester
does that seem unfair
to anyone else
not at all
bender look at him
nash
taking a reverse
constitutional
im hoping to extract
an algorithm
to define
their movement
oh
psycho
sol
hey nash i thought
you dropped out
you ever going
to go to class or
classes will dull your mind
destroy the potential
for authentic creativity
oh oh i didnt
know that
nash is going to stun us all
with his genius
which is another way
of saying
he doesnt have
the nerve to compete
you scared
terrified
mortified
petrified
stupefied by you
no starch
pressed and folded
let me ask
you something john
be my guest martin
bender and sol here
correctly completed
allens proof
of peyrots conjecture
adequate work
without innovation
oh im flattered
you flattered
flattered
and ive got
two weapons briefs
under security review
by the dod
derivative drivel
but nash achievements
zero
im a patient man martin
is there an actual
question coming
what if you never come up
with your original idea
huh
how will it feel
when im chosen for wheeler
and youre not
what if you lose
bender
ah there it is
chuckles
you should not have won
hmmm
i had the first move
my my play was perfect
the hubris
of the defeated
the game is flawed
gentlemen
the greatjohn nash
charles
youve been in here
for two days
you know hansens
just published another paper
i cant even find a topic
for my doctorate
well on the bright side
youve invented window art
this is a group
playing touch football
this is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over bread crumbs
and this here is a woman
who is chasing a man
who stole her purse
john you watched
a mugging
thats weird
in competitive behavior
someone always loses
well my niece knows that
john and shes about this high
see if i could derive
an equilibrium
where prevalence is
a nonsingular event
where nobody loses
can you imagine the effect
that would have
on conflict scenarios
and arms negotiations
when did you last eat
when did you last eat
currency exchange
you know food
you have no respect
for cognitive reverie
you know that
yes but pizza
now pizza i have
enormous respect for
and of course beer
i have respect for beer
i have respect for beer
bender good evening neils
hansen hey nash
whos winning
you or you
bender evening nash
sol hey guys
hey nash
woman
hes looking
at you for sure
hey nash
neils is trying
to get your attention
bender youre joking
sol oh no
go with god
come back a man
fortune favors the brave
bombs away
gentlemen might i remind you
that my odds of success
dramatically improve
with each attempt
this is going
to be classic
maybe you want
to buy me a drink
i dont exactly know
what im required to say
in order for you
to have intercourse with me
but could we assume
that i said all that
essentially were talking
about fluid exchange right
so could we just
go straight to the sex
oh that was sweet
have a nice night
asshole
man laughs
neilson ladies wait
charles l
i especially liked
the bit about fluid exchange
it was really charming
professor
walk with me john
ive been meaning
to talk with you
the faculty is completing
midyear reviews
were deciding which placement
applications to support
wheeler sir
that would be
my first choice
and actually
i dont really have
a second choice sir
john your fellows
have attended classes
theyve written papers
theyve published
im still searching sir
for my
your original idea i know
governing dynamics sir
its very clever john
but im afraid
its just not nearly
good enough
may i
thank you
ive been working
on manifold embedding
my bargaining stratagems
are starting to show
some promise
if you could just
arrange another meeting
if youd be kind enough
with professor einstein
ive repeatedly asked
you for that
now john
id be able to show him
my revisions on his
john
do you see what theyre
doing in there
professor congratulations
max thank you so much
congratulations
professor max
max thank you sir
thank you
its the pens
reserved for a member
of the department
that makes the achievement
of a lifetime
now what do you see john
recognition
well done professor
well done
well try seeing
accomplishment
is there a difference
john
you havent focused
im sorry
but up to this point
your record doesnt warrant
any placement at all
good day
and my compliments
to you sir
thank you so much
i cant see it
whimpers
aah
jesus christ john
i cant fail
this is all i am
come on lets go out
i got to get
something done
john
i cant keep
staring into space
john enough
got to face the wall
follow their rules
read their books
you want to do
some damage fine
but dont mess around
do their classes
come on
go on bust your head
kill yourself
john do it
dont mess around
bust your head
go on
bust that worthless head
wide open
goddamn it charles
what the hell is
your problem
its not my problem
and its not your problem
its their problem
your answer isnt
face the wall
its out there
where youve been working
panting
gasps
that was heavy
that isaac newton fellow
was right
he was onto something
clever boy
giggles
john
dont worry thats mine
ill come and get it
in a minute
both laughing
oh god
neilson incoming gentlemen
sol ayyiyi
sighs
deep breaths
sol nash you might
want to stop
shuffling your papers
for five seconds
i will not buy
you gentlemen beer
bender
oh were not here
for beer my friend
john oh
sol chuckles
does anyone else feel she should be
moving in slow motion
will she want
a large wedding ya think
shall we say swords gentlemen
pistols at dawn
have you remembered nothing
recall the lessons
of adam smith
the father
of modern economics
in competition
sol and neilson
individual ambition
serves the common good
exactly
every man for himself
gentlemen
bender
and those who strike out
are stuck with her friends
hansen
im not gonna strike out
sol
you can lead a blonde to water
but you cant make her drink
i dont think he said that
sol nobody move
shes looking over here
shes looking at nash
hansen
oh god he may have
the upper hand now
but wait until he
opens his mouth
laughing
remember the last time
bender
oh yes that was one
for the history books
adam smith needs revision
what are you
talking about
if we all go for the blonde
we block each other
not a single one of us
is gonna get her
so then we go
for her friends
but they will all
give us the cold shoulder
because nobody likes
to be second choice
well what if no one goes
for the blonde
we dont get
in each others way
and we dont insult
the other girls
thats the only way we win
thats the only
way we all get laid
laughs
adam smith said
the best result comes
from everyone
in the group doing
whats best
for himself right
thats what he
said right
right
incomplete
incomplete okay
because the best result
will come
from everyone in the group
doing whats best for himself
and the group
nash if this is some way
for you to get the blonde
on your own
you can go to hell
governing dynamics
governing dynamics
adam smith
was wrong
sol oh here we go
neilson careful careful
thank you
c ofs equals
c oft
muttering
you do realize this
flies in the face
of a 1 50 years
of economic theory
yes i do sir
thats rather presumptuous
dont you think
it is sir
stifled laugh
well mr nash
with a breakthrough
of this magnitude
im confident you will get
any placement you like
wheeler labs
theyll ask you to recommend
two team members
whispering
yes
stills and frank
are excellent choices
sol and bender sir
sol and bender are
extraordinary mathematicians
has it occurred to you
that sol and bender
might have plans
of their own
laughing
baby
wheeler we made it
cheers cheers cheers
to oh oh
okay awkward moment
gentlemen
umm
hmm
governing dynamics
congratulations john
thanks
toast
to wheeler labs
neilson
to wheeler

five years later
man
general the analyst
from wheeler lab is here
dr nash your coat
thank you sir
doctor general this is
wheeler team leader
dr john nash
glad you could
come doctor
hello
right this way
weve been intercepting
radio transmissions from moscow
the computer cant
detect a pattern
but im sure its code
john
why is that general
ever just know
something dr nash
constantly
general
weve developed several ciphers
if youd like to review
our preliminary data
doctor
nashs voice
mental voice
continues listing numbers
i need a map
461 308
starkey corners maine
91 263 5
prairie portage
minnesota
these are latitudes
and longitudes
there are a least 1 0 others
they appear to be routing orders
across the border into the us
extraordinary
gentlemen we need
to move on this
whos big brother
youve done your country
a great service son
captain
yes sir
accompany dr nash
what are the russians
moving general
captain rogers will escort you
to the unrestricted area doctor
thank you
captain
dr nash follow me please
man on radio
none of those who have
said they dont
like the method
have told us any other method
they could use
that would be effective
and when you hear
driver its dr nash
all right
wheeler defense labs
mit campus
thank you sir
home run at the pentagon
have they actually
taken the word classified
out of the dictionary
oh hi
the air conditioning broke again
how am i supposed to be
in here saving the world
if im melting
our hearts go out to you
you know two trips
to the pentagon in four years
thats two more than weve had
it gets better john
just got our latest
scintillating assignment
you know the russians
have the hbomb
the nazis are repatriating
south america
the chinese have
a standing army of 28 million
and i am doing
stress tests on a dam
you made the cover
of fortune again
please note the use
of the word you not we
that was supposed
to be just me
oh
laughs
so not only do they rob me
of the fields medal
now they put me on the cover
of fortune magazine
with these hacks
these scholars of trivia
john exactly whats
the difference
between genius
and most genius
quite a lot
hes your son
anyway youve got 1 0 minutes
ive always got 1 0 minutes
sol
before your new class
can i not get a note
from a doctor or something
you are a doctor john
and no
now come on
you know the drill
we get these
beautiful facilities
mit gets americas
great minds of today
teaching americas
great minds of tomorrow
poor bastards
now have a nice day at school
the bells ringing
door opens
the eager young minds
of tomorrow
loudjackhammering
can we leave one open
professor
its really hot sir
your comfort comes second
to my ability
to hear my own voice
personally
i think this class
will be a waste
of your
and what is infinitely worse
my time
however here we are
so you may attend or not
you may complete
your assignments at your whim
we have begun
miss
excuse me
excuse me
hey hey
hi
um we have
a little problem
its extremely hot in here
with the windows closed
and extremely noisy
with them open
so i was wondering
if there was any way you could
i dont know
maybe work someplace else
for about 45 minutes
worker not a problem
thank you so much
at a break
got it
worker
lets go lets clean it
a little bit
as you will find
in multivariable calculus
there is often
a number of solutions
for any given problem
as i was saying
this problem here
will take some of you
many months to solve
for others among you
it will take you the term
of your natural lives
man
professor nash
william parcher
big brother
at your service
what can i do
for the department of defense
are you going to
to give me a raise
lets take a walk
impressive work
at the pentagon
yes it was
oppenheimer used to say
genius sees the answer
before the question
you knew oppenheimer
his project was
under my supervision
which project
that project
its not that simple
you know
well you ended the war
we incinerated 1 50000 people
in a heartbeat
great deeds come
at great cost mr parcher
well conviction
it turns out
is a luxury of those
on the sidelines mr nash
ill try
and keep that in mind
so john no family
no close friends
why is that
john
i like to think its
because im a lone wolf
but mainly its because
people dont like me
chuckles
well there are
certain endeavors
where your lack
of personal connection
would be considered
an advantage
this is a secure area
they know me
have you ever
been here
we were told during
our initial briefing
that these warehouses
were abandoned
thats not precisely accurate
low radio chatter
tapes screeching
sirens
man speaking russian
by telling you
what im about to tell you
i am increasing
your security clearance
to top secret
disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment
get it
what operation
those are a good idea
this factory is in berlin
we seized it
at the end of the war
nazi engineers were attempting
to build a portable atomic bomb
the soviets reached
this facility before we did
and we lost the damn thing
the routing orders
at the pentagon
they were about this
werent they
the soviets arent
as unified as people believe
a faction of the red army
calling itself novaya svobga
the new freedom
has control of the bomb
and intends to detonate it
on us soil
their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties
parcher
man is capable
of as much atrocity
as he has imagination
new freedom has sleeper agents
here in the us
mccarthy is an idiot
but unfortunately
that doesnt make him wrong
new freedom communicates
to its agents
through codes imbedded
in newspapers and magazines
and thats where you come in
you see john
what distinguishes you
is that you are
quite simply
the best natural codebreaker
i have ever seen
what exactly is it
that you would like me to do
commit this list
of periodicals to memory
scan each new issue
find any hidden codes
decipher them
doctor
place your chin
on the chin rest
stare into the light
man pulse 88 regular
okay this may be
a little uncomfortable
groans
thats got
a little zap to it doesnt it
he just implanted
a radium diode
dont worry its safe
the isotope decays predictably
as a result
these numbers change over time
theyre the access codes
to your drop spot
so what am i now a spy
knocking
come
boy you must be
really important
its all right mike
what are you working on
classified
everyone waited
half an hour
for
class
you missed class today
oh i suspect that
nobody missed me
chuckles
the problem that you left
on the board
i solved it
oh no you didnt
you didnt even look
i never said
that the vector fields
were rational functions
your solution is elegant
though on this
particular occasion
ultimately incorrect
youre still here
im still here
why
im wondering professor nash
if i can ask you
to dinner
you do eat dont you
oh on occasion yeah
chuckles
table for one prometheus alone
chained to the rock
with the bird circling overhead
you know how it is
laughs
no i expect
that you wouldnt
you wouldnt know
if you leave your address
with my office
ill pick you up
friday at 800
and well eat
one more thing
do you have a name
or should i just
keep calling you miss
governor
may i present
miss alicia larde
miss alicia larde
how do you do
professor please
you and the governor
wait one second im sorry
i want a copy of this
first big date and all
you know
so you boys need
to look good
which is not a state
you find yourselves in
altogether naturally
there better
im surprising him
you just keep on surprising him
professor
god must be a painter
why else would we
have so many colors
so youre a painter
thats not actually
what i said
but yes
i am
here
me
your date
practice human interaction
and social comportment
thats a plan
champagne would be lovely
ill be outside
i will get the champagne
oh thank you
thank you for that
no keep it
i believe in deciding things
will be good luck
do you
no
i dont believe in luck
but i do believe
in assigning value to things
oh
i once tried
to count them all
i actually made it to 4348
you are exceptionally odd
i bet youre very
popular with the girls
a pair of odd ducks then
mmm
pick a shape
what
pick a shape
an animal anything
okay
an umbrella
do it again
chuckles
do it again
all right
what would you like
do uh
an octopus
dog barking
alicia chuckles
alicia
you dont talk much do you
i cant talk to you
about my work alicia
i dont mean work
i find that polishing
my interactions
in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort
i have a tendency to expedite
information flow
by being direct
i often dont get
a pleasant result
try me
all right
i find you attractive
your aggressive
moves towards me
indicate that you
feel the same way
but still
ritual requires that we
continue with a number
of platonic activities
before we have sex
i am proceeding
with those activities
but in point of actual fact
all i really want to do
is have intercourse with you
as soon as possible
are you gonna slap me now
how was that result
girl
what are you doing
im attempting to isolate
patterned reoccurrences
within periodicals
over time and you
you talk funny mr nash
do i know you
my uncle says youre very smart
but not very nice
so i shouldnt pay no mind
if youre mean to me
and who might
your uncle be
the prodigal roommate
returns
chuckles
come here
charles charles charles
my sister
got herself killed
in a car crash
not too far now marcee
her cowboy husband
was too drunk
to know that he was
too drunk to drive
so i took her in
shes so small
shes young john
thats how they come
im at harvard
doing the great
authors workshop
dh bloody lawrence
i really do think you should
buy yourself a new book
chuckles
well ive been reading
a lot about you
how are you john
at first all my work
here was trivial
but a new assignment
came up and
i cant really tell you
any details
top secret
black bag black ops
something like that
and uh
yes
well l i met a girl
no a human girl
homo sapiens
a biped
yup and contrary
to all probabilities
she finds me attractive
on a number of different levels
laughs
really
god thats wonderful
theres no accounting
for taste is there
should i marry her
oh god right
i mean everythings
going well
the job is fine
i have enough money
it all seems to add up
but how do you know for sure
nothings ever for sure john
thats the only
sure thing i do know
waiter
good evening
alicia please dont be angry
i just lost track
of time at work
again
mmhmm
im sorry
i didnt have time
to wrap it
happy birthday
the refractive faces
of the glass you see
they create
a full wavelength dispersal
so if you look inside it
you can see
every possible color
every possible color
yeah
remember you said that time
god must be a painter
because of all the colors
at the governors house
you said that
i didnt think
you were listening
im always listening
its beautiful
chuckles
alicia does our
relationship warrant
longterm commitment
cause i need
some kind of proof
some kind of verifiable
empirical data
laughs
im sorry
just give me a moment
to redefine
my girlish notions of romance
a proof
verifiable data
um okay
well how big
is the universe
infinite
how do you know
i know because
all the data indicate it
but it hasnt been proven yet
no
you havent seen it
how do you know for sure
i dont i just believe it
mmm
its the same
with love i guess
now
the part that
you dont know
is if i want
to marry you
applause

william my circumstance

alicias pregnant

how can i miss seeing
a guest lecture
by the inimitable
john nash
whats wrong
i got myself into something
i think i might need some help
well now you tell me
what is it
woman
professor nash
welcome
after
john
so we see that
the the zeroes
of the reimann
zeta function
correspond
to singularities
in spacetime
singularities
in spacetime
and conventional
number theory
it breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration
sometimes our expectations
are betrayed
by the numbers
variables are impossible
to assign any
rational value
professor nash
hold it
professor nash
professor nash
lets avoid a scene
shall we
what do you want
my name is rosen
dr rosen
im a psychiatrist
forgive me
if i dont seem persuaded
id like you

thorazine takes
a little while to wear off
sorry about
the restraints

of a right hook
weakly

ahem
macarthur psychiatric hospital
i find that highly unlikely
you made a mistake
my work is nonmilitary
in application

theres no good
in keeping secrets you know
groans
buzzer
charles
charles
i didnt mean to get you
involved in this
im im sorry
charles
the prodigal roommate

on the lecture slate
you lying son of a bitch
who are you talking to
tell me who you see
how do you say
charles herman in russian
how do you say it
in russian
theres no one there john
theres no one there
hes right there
hes right there
stop
i dont know anything
stop l i dont know anything
my name is john nash
im being held
against my will
somebody call
the department of defense
my name is john nash
im being held
against my will
alicia
whats wrong with him
john has schizophrenia
people with this disorder
are often paranoid
but but his work
he deals with conspiracies
yes yes i know
in johns world these behaviors
are accepted
encouraged
as such his illness
may have gone untreated
far longer than is typical
what do you mean
how long
possibly since
graduate school
at least thats when
his hallucinations
seem to have begun
what are you talking about
what hallucinations
one so far
that i am aware of
an imaginary roommate
named charles herman
charles isnt imaginary
he and john have been
best friends since princeton
have you ever met charles
has he ever come to dinner
hes always in town
for so little time lecturing
was he at your wedding
he had to teach
have you ever
seen a picture of him
talked to him
on the telephone
this is ridiculous
i phoned princeton
according to their
housing records
john lived alone
now which is more likely
that your husband
a mathematician
with no military training
is a government spy
fleeing the russians
youre making him sound crazy
or that he has
lost his grip on reality
now the only way
i can help him
is to show him
the difference
between whats real
and what is in his mind
come on
whats he been working on
his work is classified
he mentioned a supervisor
by the name
of william parcher
maybe mr parcher
can clarify things for us
but i cant get to him
without clearances
you want me to help you get
the details of my husbands work
john thinks im a russian spy
is that what you think
what did the doctor say
is he sick
i dont know
i want to see whatjohns
been working on
you know you cant
go in his office
its classified alicia
stop oh
oh my god
oh my god
why didnt you
say something
alicia johns always been
a little weird
he said he was
doing codebreaking
that it was eyesonly
top secret part
of the military effort
was he
well it was possible
you know
directives come down
all the time
that some of us
arent cleared for
it was possible
possible but
not likely
lately hed become
so much more agitated
and then when you called
so is this all
hes been doing every day
cutting out magazines
well not all
door opens
alicia im so sorry
john its okay
i missed you
i missed you
i have to talk to you
okay
alicia ive been
thinking about it
and i do realize
that my behavior
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you
must have appeared insane
i left you with no other choice
i do understand
and im truly sorry
thats okay
everythings gonna be all right
everythings gonna be all right
we just have to talk quietly
they may be listening
there may be microphones
im gonna tell you
everything now
its breaking with protocol
but you need to know
because you have to help me
get out of here
ive been doing topsecret work
for the government
theres a threat that exists
of catastrophic proportions
i think the russians
feel my profile is too high
thats why they simply
just dont do away with me
theyre keeping me here
to try to stop me
from doing my work
you have to get to wheeler
you have to find
william parcher
stop
he can help us
stop stop stop
i went to wheeler
good good
there is no william parcher
of course there is
ive been working for him
doing what
breaking codes
dropping packages
in a secret mailbox
for the government to pick up
how could you know that
sol followed you
he thought it was harmless
sol followed me
theyve never been opened
it isnt real
there is no conspiracy john
there is no william parcher
its in your mind
do you understand baby
youre sick
youre sick john

dr rosen
you see the nightmare
of schizophrenia
is not knowing whats true
imagine
if you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places
and the moments
most important to you
were not gone not dead
but worse
had never been
what kind of hell
would that be
administering insulin
man
842 am
how often

princeton university
1 year later
alicia
john always spoke so fondly
of being here at princeton
and hansen is running
the department now
so he keeps reminding us
and reminding us
laughs
yeah
john wont come near
the campus though
i think hes ashamed
baby cries
hey hey
want this
so alicia how
how are you holding up
well the delusions have passed
theyre saying
with the medication
and low stress environment
no l i mean
how are you
i think often what i feel
is obligation
or guilt over wanting to leave
rage againstjohn
against god and
but
then i look at him
and i force myself to see
the man that i married
and he becomes that man
hes transformed
into someone that i love
and im transformed
into someone who loves him
its not all the time
but
its enough
i thinkjohn is
a very lucky man
alicia
so unlucky
alicia this is us
sol this is it
its nice
its near where i work
alicia

parcher
the bomb is in

knowing your situation
requires you keep
a low profile mohammed
weve brought
the mountain to you
generator whirrs
radio signals
weve narrowed the bombs
location to somewhere

but we havent been able
to pinpoint its exact position
their codes have grown
increasingly complex
here look at this john

dr rosen said
rosen that quack
schizophrenic break
from reality right
psychological bullshit
look at me john
john look at me

marcee
unclejohn
charles

now
mental voices
alicia and charles never
coexist in the same
interactive field
alicia and parcher
voices continue
marcee lets play
voices increase
charles and marcee cannot
coexist with alicia
i understand
engine starts
screams
she never gets old
marcee cant be real
she never gets old
you see them now
yes
why did you
stop your meds
because i couldnt do my work
i couldnt help
with the baby
i couldnt
i couldnt respond to my wife
you think thats better
than being crazy
well need to start you
on a higher run
of insulin shocks
and a new medication
no
there has
to be another way
dr rosen
schizophrenia is degenerative
some days may be
symptomfree
but over time
you are getting worse
its a problem thats all it is
its a problem with no solution
and thats what i do
i solve problems
thats what i do best
this isnt math
dr rosen
you cant come up
with a formula
to change the way
you experience the world
all i have to do
is apply my mind
theres no theorem no proof
you cant reason
your way out of this
why not why cant i
because your mind
is where the problem is
in the first place
i can do this
i can work it out
all i need is time
is that the baby
the babys
at my mothers john
marcee humming
dr rosen
without treatment john
the fantasies
may take over
entirely
alicia
you almost ready
rosens waiting outside
i cant go back
to that hospital
i wont come home
he said that
if you said that
he has commitment
papers for me to sign
well maybe you
wont sign them
maybe youll just
give me some time
i will try to figure this out
whatever you do
rosen is right
about one thing
you shouldnt be here
im not safe anymore
would you have hurt me john
i dont know
maybe you should let
dr rosen drive you to your mothers
muffled voices
car doors close
engine starts
car departs
footsteps on stairs
rosen said to call if you try
and kill me or anything
you want to know whats real
this
this
this
this is real
maybe the part
that knows the waking
from the dream
maybe it isnt here
maybe its here
i need to believe
that something
extraordinary is possible
sighs
princeton university
two months later
hansen
come
hello martin
jesus christ
no l
i dont have that one
my savior complex
takes on a completely
different form
nash chuckles
i heard what happened
and well
l i wanted to write
and i tried you at macarthurs
but youd left
and i just
this is helingers
old office
yeah
yeah i stole it from him
seems that you won
after all martin
they were wrong john
no one wins
please please have a seat
god its so good
to see you
what brings you
back to princeton
charles john
john im sorry
but you have to tell him
tell him youre a genius
youre a genius john
tell him your work is critical
john please
is there any chance
that you could ignore
what i just did
of course
what are old friends for
is that what we are martin
friends
john of course
of course
we always have been
alicia and i think that
that fitting in
being part of a community
might do me some good
that a certain level of attachment
familiar places familiar people
might help me
elbow out these
these certain delusions that i have
its a lot to ask
and now that im here
im quite certain
that you will just say no
but i was wondering
if i could hang around
sighs
huh
will you be needing an office
no
no i could just work
out of the library
well this guy tries
to wander into the library
but he doesnt have id
why cant people read
their memos huh
then he goes totally nuts
john
not real
youre not real
theres no mission
oh shit shit
not real
you are not real
is this what you are soldier
some useless ghoul
the local madman
im not a soldier
youre gonna end up
in a cell
old worthless discarded
theres no mission
and while you rock and drool
the world will burn to ashes
you are not real
you are not real
youre still talking
to me soldier
theres no mission
im not a soldier
john john
john john john john
hey hey hey
hey hey hey
john john

john hey nash

hansen
john
john
you shouldve seen their faces
everybody was
just staring at me
john
you know that stress
triggers the delusions
i know
but then on the way home
charles was there
sometimes i really miss
talking to him
maybe rosens right
maybe i have to think
about going back into
the hospital again
no
come here
maybe try again tomorrow
john now you cant
ignore me forever
charles youve been
a very good friend to me
the best
but i wont talk to you again
i just cant

sniffs
goodbye
goodbye
i was wondering if i might
audit your course
its its an honor
professor nash
is something wrong
this will be my first class
laughs
good morning
eager young minds
muttering numbers
its never gonna work john
youre just
humiliating yourself
its pathetic
you are being pathetic
im ashamed of you
laughing
laughing continues
oh man
are you coming
youre gonna be late
dad youve got my book
what
youve got my book
oh right
thanks
goodbye
bye
alicia

bye honey
princeton university
october 1 97 8
did you just solve reimann
well what do you think
huh
thats an analog to frobenius
for noncommutative extensions
chuckles
yes it is
but it only appears
to work sporadically so no
but
i believe im
making progress
youre
yourejohn nash right
toby kelly
hello
ive been studying
your equilibrium
the one you wrote here
at princeton
to come up with something
totally original the way you did
you know i was young
chuckles
umm
ive been developing a theory
i believe i can prove
that galois extensions
are covering spaces
that everything
everything is connected
that its all part
of the same subject
when was the last time
you ate
excuse me
you know food
oh uh
my wife
she loves mayonnaise
oh thank you
thank you
go on
the function
is in the two categories
umhmm
hansen
alicia
alicia
john
coming together
at maximum speed of
let us say
1 0 miles per hour
so you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle b
and the fly who can travel
at 20 miles an hour
leaves the tire
of bicycle b and it flies
to the tire of bicycle a
and backwards and forwards
and so on and so forth
until the two bikes collide
and the poor little fly
is squashed
chuckling
this is the important thing
about actually focusing in
and comprehending
the area that youre
dealing with
mathematics is very specific
and it is an art form
no matter what these people
around here will tell you
especially the people from biology
dont listen to any
of those people
let me go back
to what you were doing before
i might want to steal this
write a book and get famous
i was thinking
that i might teach
a classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone
john besides
youre a terrible teacher
im an acquired
taste martin
i was hoping there still
might be something
i could contribute
what about the
well you know
are they gone
no theyre not gone
and maybe they
never will be
but ive gotten used
to ignoring them
and i think as a result
theyve kind of given up on me
you think thats what its like
with all our dreams
and our nightmares martin
youve got to keep feeding them
for them to stay alive
john they
haunt you though
theyre my past martin
everybodys haunted by their past
well goodbye
john ill talk
to the department
maybe in the spring
hey nash
you
you scared
terrified
mortified
petrified
stupefied by you
now you ought best ring alicia
or youre gonna get me
ill ring her
in an awful
lot of trouble
thanks professor
goodbye
have a nice day
goodbye
papers in hand mr beyer
princeton university
march 1 994
professor nash
can you see him
yeah
you sure
uhhuh
positive
hes within your vision
laughing
okay good
forgive me im just
always suspicious of new people
see you next week professor
see you next week
so now that i know
that youre real
who are you and what can
i do for you
professor my name
is thomas king
thomas king
mmmhm
and im here
to tell you
that youre being considered
for the nobel prize
john
forgive me but im just
a little stunned
king
over the past few years
your equilibrium
has become a cornerstone
of modern economics
suddenly everybody
likes that one
what about my work
on other some such projects
manifold embedding
the application
of your bargaining problem
to fcc bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases
antitrust cases
yes
i never would have
considered that
well
have i just reached
some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity
laughs
no no you havent
cause i wouldnt
have thought of that
shall we have tea
oh i dont go in there
i usually just
take my sandwich
in the library
come on john
lets have some tea
its a big day
mmost
most commercially
available brands of tea
are not suitable to my palate
im not
there are some
northern indian teas
which are dense enough
i enjoy the flavor
that they have
i have not been in this room
for some many years
i wonder what tea they serve
john
why thank you young lady
things have certainly
changed around here
i have a son that age
harvard
king chuckles
hmm
i would have thought
the nominations
for the nobel prize
would have been secret
i would have thought
youd only find out
if you won or lost
that is generally
the case yes
but these are
special circumstances
the awards are substantial
they require private funding
as such
the image of the nobel is
i see you came here
to find out if i was crazy
find out if i would
screw everything up
if i actually won
dance around the podium
strip naked and squawk
like a chicken
things of this nature
something like that yes
would i embarrass you
yes it is possible
you see l
i am crazy
i take the newer medications
but i still see things
that are not here
i just choose
not to acknowledge them
like a diet of the mind
i choose not to indulge
certain appetites
like my appetite for patterns
perhaps my appetite
to imagine and to dream
man
professor nash
its good to have
you here john
thank you
its an honor sir
thank you very much
a privilege professor
professor
nicely done john
thank you tom
thank you
thank you
thank you ed
that was certainly most unexpected
applause
nobel prize ceremony
stockholm sweden
december 1 994
john
thank you
applause fades
ive always believed in numbers
in the equations and logics
that lead to reason
but after a lifetime
of such pursuits
i ask
what truly is logic
who decides reason
my quest has taken me
through the physical
the metaphysical
the delusional
and back
and i have made the most important
discovery of my career
the most important discovery
of my life
it is only in the mysterious
equations of love
that any logical
reasons can be found
im only here tonight
because of you
you are the reason i am
you are all my reasons
thank you
john
so nice to have met you
ill call for the car dad
byebye
woman
byebye

oh yes i am
yes indeed
and yes please
thank you so much
thank you
what is it whats wrong
nothing
nothing at all
come with me young lady
ohhh
i have a car outside
are you interested in a ride
nashs theories have influenced
global trade negotiations
wheres it going to
national labor relations and even
breakthroughs in evolutionary biology
john and alicia nash live
