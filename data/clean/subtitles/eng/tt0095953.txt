dedication to family 
and charity to all 
and now  with sure and certain hope
of resurrection life 
we commend to you
the soul of our departed friend   
just have to go over the details of the will
tonight  then we re outta here 
i can wait in the car if you like 
somebody should be watering
those roses  they re dying 
i knew this car my whole life 
only drove it once 
it s a 1949 buick roadmaster convertible 
only 8 000 production models made 
straight eight  fireball eight 
the first full year
of the dynaflow transmission 
know it by rote 
you were his only child 
you came along when he was 
what  45 or something 
he probably thought he was never going
to have a son  so he had to love you 
i think you re exaggerating 
you were his child  his son  his blood 
he doesn t look like
a man who doesn t love his son 
what are you doing looking at this 
put that away  you wanna hear a story 
  don t get mad 
  the convertible in the garage 
  his baby  that and the goddamn roses 
  buick 
the car was off limits   that s a classic  
he d say   it s not for children   
tenth grade  i m 16 years old  and for
once i bring home a report card full of as 
i go to my old man 
 can i take the car out  
take the guys out 
sort of a victory drive 
he says no  i take it anyway 
i steal the keys  i sneak it out 
you took the car
with no permission  why  why then 
because i    i deserved it 
nothing i did was good enough
for this guy  don t you understand 
we re on columbia parkway  four kids 
we get pulled over 
an accident 
uh    pulled over   
whoo whoo whoo 
  what is  pulled over   police 
  yes  police 
  can i finish 
  yes 
he called in to report a stolen car  not
his son took the car without permission 
just stolen 
the other guys  dads bail them out
in an hour  he left me there two days 
  he left you in prison for two days 
  two days 
were you scared 
yeah  i was scared 
  left home  i never saw him again 
  charlie  after a year we ve been together 
this is the first time
i ve heard this story 
it s strange  i mean 
how can you keep all this inside you
and not say anything 
when i was a kid and i got scared 
the rain man would come and sing to me 
the rain what 
one of those imaginary
childhood friends 
  what happened to him 
  nothing  i just grew up 
not so much 
 and i remember  too 
the day you left home 
so full of bitterness and grandiose ideas 
so full of yourself   
 being raised without a mother 
your heart s hardness is understandable   
 your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me 
all these i forgive 
but your failure to write  to telephone 
to re enter my life in any way 
has left me without a son   
 i wish you all i ever wanted for you 
i wish you the best   
 i hereby bequeath to my son 
charles sanford babbitt 
that certain buick convertible 
the very car that unfortunately
brought our relationship to an end   
 also  outright title
to my prize winning hybrid rose bushes
to remind him of the value of excellence 
and the possibility of perfection   
 as for my home and all other property 
these shall be placed in trust 
in accordance with the terms of that
certain instrument executed herewith   
what does that mean  the last part 
it means that the estate  in excess
of  3 million after expenses and taxes 
will go into a trust fund for a beneficiary
to be named in this document 
  who  who is that 
  i m afraid i can t tell you that 
  who controls the money  you 
  no  he s called a trustee 
what is that  how does that work 
forgive me 
but there s nothing more i can say 
i m sorry  son 
i can see you re disappointed 
why should i be disappointed 
i got rose bushes  didn t i 
i got a used car  whatshisname   
what d you call him 
  the beneficiary 
  right 
he got  3 million  but not the rose bushes 
i definitely got the rose bushes 
  charles   
  i definitely got the rose bushes 
  there is no need to   
  to what  to be upset 
to be upset 
if there is a hell  sir 
my father is in it 
and he is looking up right now 
and he is laughing his ass off 
you wanna be his son for five minutes 
did you hear that letter 
  were you listening

for whose grandson was the
presidential retreat camp david named 
  lisa 
  eisenhower 
for david eisenhower  and you ve got
another five  ten dollar lead for lisa 
in days of yore  what would
a swashbuckler keep in his sheath 
whatever this is 
i don t understand the point of secrecy 
this patient is an old girlfriend
of my father s 
  i knew your father since you were two 
  the year my mother died 
i m trustee of the fund 
but this hospital receives nothing 
maybe that s something
we could discuss 
i took on this burden out of loyalty to
your father  that s where my loyalty ends 
and you think
i should feel that loyalty 
i think you feel cheated
out of your birthright
by a man who had
difficulty showing love 
i think if i were in your shoes
i d probably feel the same 
i was hoping you d help me understand
the right in what my father s done 
because failing that 
i have responsibilities of my own 
and they have to be met 
even if that means a fight 
this is not your car 
it s my boyfriend s 
my dad lets me drive slow
