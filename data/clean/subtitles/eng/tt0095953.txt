the soul of our departed friend
just have to go over the details of the will
tonight then were outta here
i can wait in the car if you like
somebody should be watering
those roses theyre dying
i knew this car my whole life
only drove it once
its a 1949 buick roadmaster convertible
only 8000 production models made
straight eight fireball eight
the first full year
of the dynaflow transmission
know it by rote
you were his only child
you came along when he was
what 45 or something
he probably thought he was never going
to have a son so he had to love you
i think youre exaggerating
you were his child his son his blood
he doesnt look like
a man who doesnt love his son
what are you doing looking at this
put that away you wanna hear a story
dont get mad
the convertible in the garage
his baby that and the goddamn roses
buick
the car was offlimits thats a classic
hed say its not for children
tenth grade im 16 years old and for
once i bring home a report card full of as
i go to my old man
can i take the car out
take the guys out
sort of a victory drive
he says no i take it anyway
i steal the keys i sneak it out
you took the car
with no permission why why then
because i i deserved it
nothing i did was good enough
for this guy dont you understand
were on columbia parkway four kids
we get pulled over
an accident
uh pulled over
whoowhoowhoo
what is pulled over police
yes police
can i finish
yes
he called in to report a stolen car not
his son took the car without permission
just stolen
the other guys dads bail them out
in an hour he left me there two days
he left you in prison for two days
two days
were you scared
yeah i was scared
left home i never saw him again
charlie after a year weve been together
this is the first time
ive heard this story
its strange i mean
how can you keep all this inside you
and not say anything
when i was a kid and i got scared
the rain man would come and sing to me
the rain what
one of those imaginary
childhood friends
what happened to him
nothing i just grew up
not so much
and i remember too
the day you left home
so full of bitterness and grandiose ideas
so full of yourself
being raised without a mother
your hearts hardness is understandable
your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me
all these i forgive
but your failure to write to telephone
to reenter my life in any way
has left me without a son
i wish you all i ever wanted for you
i wish you the best
i hereby bequeath to my son
charles sanford babbitt
that certain buick convertible
the very car that unfortunately
brought our relationship to an end
also outright title
to my prizewinning hybrid rose bushes
to remind him of the value of excellence
and the possibility of perfection
as for my home and all other property
these shall be placed in trust
in accordance with the terms of that
certain instrument executed herewith
what does that mean the last part
it means that the estate in excess
of 3 million after expenses and taxes
will go into a trust fund for a beneficiary
to be named in this document
who who is that
im afraid i cant tell you that
who controls the money you
no hes called a trustee
what is that how does that work
forgive me
but theres nothing more i can say
im sorry son
i can see youre disappointed
why should i be disappointed
i got rose bushes didnt i
i got a used car whatshisname
whatd you call him
the beneficiary

he got 3 million but not the rose bushes
i definitely got the rose bushes
charles

whatever this is
i dont understand the point of secrecy
this patient is an old girlfriend
of my fathers
i knew your father since you were two
the year my mother died
im trustee of the fund
but this hospital receives nothing
maybe thats something
we could discuss
i took on this burden out of loyalty to
your father thats where my loyalty ends
and you think
i should feel that loyalty
i think you feel cheated
out of your birthright
by a man who had
difficulty showing love
i think if i were in your shoes
id probably feel the same
i was hoping youd help me understand
the right in what my fathers done
because failing that
i have responsibilities of my own
and they have to be met
even if that means a fight
this is not your car
