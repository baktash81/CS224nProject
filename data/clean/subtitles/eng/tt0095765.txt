giggling and laughing

she s very nice 
my age  slim  long hair  brown 
big eyes  very blue  honest and direct 
a little beauty markon her lip 
very small  you only see it up close 
when she smiles  you feel like    i don t know 
love 
love 
i know how it is    the blue eyed ones are the
worst 
no matter what you do  they ll never be your
friends 
nothing for it 
the bigger the man  the deeper his imprint 
and if he loves  he suffers  knowing it s a
dead end street 
that s nice  what you just said

understand   
and no way to explain 
oh  you made the world 
with due respect to the lord   
who made the world in 2  3 days   
i d have taken a bit longer   
but in all modesty  i would ve done it better 
like i said    you always have an answer 
just for you  toto  i ll tell you a story 
let s sit down a minute 
misery of miseries 
once   
a king gave a feast   
for the loveliest princessesin the realm 
now  a soldierwho was standing guard   
saw the king s daughter go by 
she was the most beautiful of all   
and he instantly fell in love 
but what is a simple soldier   
next to the daughter of a king 
well  at last he succeededin meeting her   
and he told her he could no longerlive without
her 
the princess was so takenby the depth of his
feeling   
that she said to the soldier   
 if you can wait   
for 100 days and 100 nightsunder my balcony   
at the end of it  i shall be yours  
with that  the soldier wentand waited one day   
two days  then ten  then twenty 
each eveningthe princess looked out   
and he never moved 
in rain  in wind  in snow  he was always there 
birds shat on his head  bees stung him   
but he didn t budge 
at the end   
of 90 days   
he had become   
all dry  all white 
tears streamed from his eyes 
he couldn t hold them back 
he didn t even havethe strength to sleep 
and all that time  the princess watched him 
at long last  it was the 99th night   
and the soldier stood up  took his chair   
and left 
what  at the end 
at the very end 
and don t ask what it means  i don t know 
if you understand it  you tell me 
only one print 
you know i need two  one for the paradiso   
one for the next town 
you promised  i put up posters  made commitments 
if you screw me  watch out 
one print for two theaters 
you ll pay for this 
i m from naples  and you will see it and die 
we see the crib  the child s asleep 
 do something  
the lawyer told me  now i know 
 the lawyer told me  now i know  
and everyone must know  yes  everyone must know 
 everyone must know  
you believe me

it s toto  i knew it 
see how nice the house is 
we had it all redone  all thanks to you 
i have a surprise for you  come 
are you tired 
you have time to restbefore the funeral 
no  mama  it s only an hour by plane 
don t tell me thatafter all these years 
come  i put everything in here  all your things 
he must be glad you came  toto 
he always talked about you  always 
right up to the end 
he really    he really loved you 
he left something for you 
before you leave   
come see me 
how have you been 
when did you close it down 
six years ago in may  nobody came anymore 
you know better than i  mr  di vita    the economy 
tv  videos 
the old movie businessis just a memory 
the city bought the sitefor a parking lot 
they re demolishing it saturday  it s too bad 
what s this  mr  di vita  
you used to order me around 
now that you re a big shot  it s a little
different 
but  if you insist  toto 
excuse me 
who would ve believed it    little toto 
this is    what he left for you 
he never asked to see me 
no  never 
once your mother said to him   
that if he wanted it  you d surely come 
he was furious  he said   no 
toto must never come backto giancaldo  
he didn t say it to be mean 
he was a good man 
who knows what was goingthrough his head 
towards the end  he said strange things 
a moment beforehe closed his eyes   
he told your mothershe mustn t let you know 
what re you thinking 
just that i ve always beenafraid to come back 
and now  after all these years  i thought i was
stronger   
that i d forgottena lot of things 
but in fact   
i find i m right backwhere i was   
as if i d never been away 
yet when i look around  i don t recognize anyone 
and you  mama   
i deserted you 
ran out on you like a bandit   
without any explanation 
i never asked for any 
you don t have to explain to me 
i always thought it was goodwhat you did  why harp
on it 
you were right to leave 
you did what you wanted to do 
when i call you  a different woman always answers 
but i never heardin any of their voices   
that they really loved you 
i would ve known 
all the same  i d have liked   
to see you settled   
ioving someone 
but your life is there 
here there are only ghosts
