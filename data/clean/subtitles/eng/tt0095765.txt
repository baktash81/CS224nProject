understand
dont even try with feelings theres nothing to
understand
and no way to explain
oh you made the world
with due respect to the lord
who made the world in 2 3 days
id have taken a bit longer
but in all modesty i wouldve done it better
like i said you always have an answer
just for you toto ill tell you a story
lets sit down a minute
misery of miseries
once
a king gave a feast
for the loveliest princessesin the realm
now a soldierwho was standing guard
saw the kings daughter go by
she was the most beautiful of all
and he instantly fell in love
but what is a simple soldier
next to the daughter of a king
well at last he succeededin meeting her
and he told her he could no longerlive without
her
the princess was so takenby the depth of his
feeling
that she said to the soldier
if you can wait
for 100 days and 100 nightsunder my balcony
at the end of it i shall be yours
with that the soldier wentand waited one day
two days then ten then twenty
each eveningthe princess looked out
and he never moved
in rain in wind in snow he was always there
birds shat on his head bees stung him
but he didnt budge
at the end
of 90 days
he had become
all dry all white
tears streamed from his eyes
he couldnt hold them back
he didnt even havethe strength to sleep
and all that time the princess watched him
at long last it was the 99th night
and the soldier stood up took his chair
and left
what at the end
at the very end
and dont ask what it means i dont know
if you understand it you tell me
only one print
you know i need two one for the paradiso
one for the next town
you promised i put up posters made commitments
if you screw me watch out
one print for two theaters
youll pay for this
im from naples and you will see it and die
we see the crib the childs asleep
do something
the lawyer told me now i know
the lawyer told me now i know
and everyone must know yes everyone must know
everyone must know
you believe me
you believe me
yes i believe you
yes i believe you

and no one knows where she is
probably thats howit was meant to be
we each of us havea star to follow
get out of here
this land is cursed
living here day by day
you think itsthe center of the world
you believe nothingwill ever change
then you leave a year two years
when you come back everythings changed
the threads broken
what you came to find isnt there
what was yours is gone
you have to go awayfor a long time
many years
before you can come backand find your people
the land where you were born
but now no its not possible
right nowyoure blinder than i am
who said that gary cooper james stewart henry
fonda
no toto
nobody said it
this time its all me
life isnt like in the movies
life
is much harder
get out of here
go back to rome youre young
the world is yours
and im old
i dont want to hear youtalk anymore
i want to hear talk about you
dont come back
dont think about us
dont look back dont write
dont give in to nostalgia forget us all
if you do and you come back dont come see me
i wont let you in my house understand
thank you
for everything youve done for me
whatever you end up doing love it
the way you lovedthe projection booth
when you were a little squirt
hes left toto goodbye
got here too late what a shame
its toto i knew it
see how nice the house is
we had it all redone all thanks to you
i have a surprise for you come
are you tired
you have time to restbefore the funeral
no mama its only an hour by plane
dont tell me thatafter all these years
come i put everything in here all your things
he must be glad you came toto
he always talked about you always
right up to the end
he really he really loved you
he left something for you
before you leave
come see me
how have you been
when did you close it down
six years ago in may nobody came anymore
you know better than i mr di vita the economy
tv videos
the old movie businessis just a memory
the city bought the sitefor a parking lot
theyre demolishing it saturday its too bad
whats this mr di vita
you used to order me around
now that youre a big shot its a little
different
but if you insist toto
excuse me
who wouldve believed it little toto
this is what he left for you
he never asked to see me
no never
once your mother said to him
that if he wanted it youd surely come
he was furious he said no
toto must never come backto giancaldo
he didnt say it to be mean
he was a good man
who knows what was goingthrough his head
towards the end he said strange things
a moment beforehe closed his eyes
he told your mothershe mustnt let you know
whatre you thinking
just that ive always beenafraid to come back
and now after all these years i thought i was
stronger
that id forgottena lot of things
but in fact
i find im right backwhere i was
as if id never been away
yet when i look around i dont recognize anyone
and you mama
i deserted you
ran out on you like a bandit
without any explanation
i never asked for any
you dont have to explain to me
i always thought it was goodwhat you did why harp
on it
you were right to leave
you did what you wanted to do
when i call you a different woman always answers
but i never heardin any of their voices
that they really loved you
i wouldve known
all the same id have liked
to see you settled
ioving someone
but your life is there
here there are only ghosts
