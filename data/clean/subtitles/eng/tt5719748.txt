kyle  he got mixed up with some
clown by the name of dante 
and they stole
a kilo of coke from viking 
  who s viking 
  drug dealer  a big one 
  you know him 
  yeah  when he was a snot nosed kid 
  i knew his old man  bullitt 
  dad knew him  too 
whenever bullitt had rough stuff to be done 
that was his go to guy  after dad  me 
and then viking took over 
viking s a whole
different breed 
he likes hurting people 
i m gonna kill him  brock

what makes you think
you can kill a man 
i ve   
i ve killed three of his guys

threw them on the gorge 
  chicken wire 
  yeah  to let the fish get at them 
they ll eat the flesh

  where did you learn that 
  i read it in a crime novel 
  he is my brother 
  brother 
my ass 
i know 
  maybe i should   
  shut up 
you stay out of trouble 
the things we do for love  huh 
she was skimming the till
at a massage parlor 
they sent me to beat the shit
out of her  instead   
how s grace 
she left 
the lady s got good timing 
i ll give her that 
how do i find this viking 
you don t 
  you ve gone as far up the ladder as you re gonna go 
  we ll see 
one guy can disappear 
two  i don t think so 
three  with ten keys of coke 
maybe they were
all in it together 
you think three of my dealers
ran out on me 
that would make me the worst judge of
character in the rockies  that s your theory 
  no 
  no 
it was those goddamn indians 
this is all my father s fault
for getting into bed with them 
i m sorry  the indians 
when viking s father
was first getting started 
he made a deal with an
indian named white bull 
he supplied him  white bull
dealt on the reservation 
until white bull
wanted more turf 
  so he tossed white bull a few piece of crap towns 
  like kehoe 
and kehoe builds a ski resort 
turns it into a gold mine 
what s the one thing
history s taught us 
you keep those indians
on the reservation 
those indians 
they re always wanting more 
because they think the turf
was theirs all along 
might kinda have
a point there  right 
white bull gave this
to my father   
the day they shook
on their deal 
yeah 
it s time we give it
back to him 
what can i do for you two 
you could sit down with us 
tell us your story 
i got other customers 
yeah  that s funny 
all i can see in here is you 
please tell me you work nights 
thursdays  why 
you look this good in sunlight 
i gotta see you after dark 
eggs  bacon  pancakes 
and for you 
surprise me 
okay 
i was 13 when my dad kicked it 
you know his last words to me 
 try to bang every waitress
who ever serves you  
this indian is
taking forever to show up 
so  tell me
about this motel trick of yours 
twenty bucks 
it s not a trick  all right 
it s a beautiful invention  it s an invention
steve jobs would have been proud of 
  steve jobs  huh 
  that s right 
you know what made that guy
such a genius  simplicity 
  let s hear it already 
  all right 
i stay in motels
100 nights a year  right 
first thing  every morning  i hang a
 clean the room  sign on the doorknob 
maid sees the sign 
she opens the door 
now  pay attention
to the details here 
all the hard thought
behind them 
i m lying on top of the covers 
stone naked 
first crucial part 
i look into the maid s eyes  all right 
if i don t  she backs right outta that
door  it s over before it even starts 
i take the twenty 
i lay it right on my jimmy 
  boom 
  just a twenty 
maids make  8 35 an hour 
and they ve got miserable lives too 
that s the totally
underrated part of this 
the ball is completely
in her court 
she could back out of that door
no harm  no foul 
or    she could come and get it 
  what s your success rate 
  thirty one percent 
hundred motels a year 
you do the math 
he s got the same little
yellow gloves white bull wears 
  is that an indian thing 
  i guess 
it s good 
that s steve fucking jobs good 
i see one flaw  quality control 
i m paying her 20 bucks 
i m not asking for miss america 
still  there s no way there s 31 maids
in the whole country worth banging 
you d be surprised 
oh dear 
been at it all night 
haven t gotten a thing out of him 
and you won t 
you know  pain   
it s like a religion
to these guys 
you know  the apaches used to consider
getting tortured a mark of honor 
how s that for a value system 
  he s a ute 
  what now 
local indians are utes 
not apache 
you know i married an indian 
don t you think i know the difference 
this doesn t happen
in kehoe 
it just did 
it was his first run 
 just one run  papa  
he says to me 
 i can do it  
 i m your son  
what are we going to do 
okay  let s go home to denver 
mr  coxman 
i m very sorry for your loss 
thanks 
hey 
so   
  here you go 
  thanks 
ex boyfriend of mine works vice in denver 
so i gave him a call today 
because you missed him and
wanted to see how he was doing 
well  he still thinks
there s a chance for us 
what s his name 
kurt 
  how long were you two lovers 
  oh  jesus  two months  okay 
i had him look up the forensics
on our sign hanger 
the guy s name is simon legrew 
now  his father is white bull 
he s a native american
drug dealer from denver
who s been dealing coke
around here for 30 years 
so now  white bull
shares territory with viking 
he s a denver drug dealer whose
real name is trevor calcote 
so   
i m thinking   
what we have here is a turf war 
a drug turf war 
right here in kehoe 
so what are we gonna
do about it 
well  my 30 years  experience tells
me that this is a job for denver vice 
it doesn t bother you that i just
learned more about a local drug lord
in five minutes on the phone
than you ve learned in 30 years 
what bothers me is that kurt s lying in bed
tonight convinced that he s back in your heart 
kurt s a big boy 
i knew you d be back 
all right  viking s real name
is trevor calcote 
if you want him dead 
you re gonna have to hire a hit man 
  a hit man 
  yeah  an assassin 
do you know one 
the eskimo 
so  how does this work 
you buy the eskimo a train ticket 
he s afraid to fly 
you pick him up at the train
station  you drive him to a motel
where you give him
half the money upfront 
and then you go home 
  how do i know when it s done 
  keep checking the denver post 
they can t resist
a good rub out 
what is it with all these nicknames 
speedo  viking  eskimo 
the eskimo 
it s a gangster thing 
did you have a nickname 
yeah  wingman 
wingman 
yeah  from top gun 
as in  you can be my wingman  
wingman 
come on 
i tried  buddy 
some real music  please 
  what do you want to hear 
  anything else 
just no kanye 
take it out of his tip 
there s a convention in town 
this is all i could get 
  this is only half 
  that s right 
are you a cop 
no 
the reason i ask is cops are
always a year behind the street 
but the street knows it s two thirds
upfront  one third when the deal is done 
but cops    they still think
it s half and half 
okay  we can do two thirds 
we re gonna get along
just fine 
yes 
yes  ten grand  ten grand  baby 
ten grand 
that jet touchdown
just beat your browns 
whatever happened to loyalty 
sometimes loyalty
comes at a price 
and besides 
my grandmother s from brooklyn 
so  why don t you
give her a cut 
yeah 
says he s the eskimo 
says he has information
you wanna buy 
let s hear him out 
i ve been offered
ninety grand to ice you 
to ice me 
you wanna ice a guy  you go to the eskimo 
well  that works for me 
who knew white bull
had that kind of coin 
white bull s an indian 
indians don t farm out their kills 
so  if it wasn t white bull 
then who the hell was it 
that s what i m selling 
  well  how much 
  ninety grand 
you gotta love
the symmetry  there 
you are one hell
of a businessman 
i tries 
try  it s a singular 
  do we have a deal 
   course we got a deal 
deposit the money into
this cayman islands account 
when it hits  you get the name 
goody 
i like working with pros 
cuts way down
on the bullshit factor 
yeah  so   
who wants me dead 
guy s name is coxman 
coxman 
there was a coxman
on dad s payroll  right 
what was his name  he called
himself  uh  wing    ding   
ringworm    wing    ding   
  wingman 
  wingman 
wingman 
wingman wants me dead  why 
the why of it ain t my
business so i don t aks 
ask 
  i think our business here is done 
  so it is 
hey  can i ask two questions 
if i may 
one pro to another 
shoot 
why do they call you the eskimo 
comes from the brothers
in the hood 
any nigga crazy enough
to move up to snow country
has gotta be a fucking eskimo 
that s    you re funny 
  second question 
  all right  it s   
who taught you your ethics 
come again 
you made a deal to kill me for 90
grand and you didn t honor that deal 
it s because
i m honoring this one 
yeah 
guess a man s word doesn t
matter in the hood  right 
guess it s just every man
for himself in there 
you see  out here 
character counts 
without character there can be
no business and   
without business   
well   
what the hell
would we do all day 
would you mind
stepping off the rug 
is this what you call
an eskimo roll 
i m thinking ireland 
maybe germany 
yeah  for what 
  my ten grand vacation 
  oh

you re gonna take me to dublin 
yeah 
hey 
mustang  if we get caught out 
wingman 
how the hell you been 
we d like you to come
for a little ride

i guess you just don t get
what you pay for anymore 
  some of us do 
  oh yeah 
well  what about speedo
and limbo and santa 
how did those guys
work out for you  huh 
okay  now before you die 
you re gonna tell me
what this is all about 
the only question is 
how much pain do you wanna endure 
i got cancer of the ass  dickweed 
so screw you  and screw your pain 
you wanna know
what this is all about 
  it s about bullitt 
  my father

he d bang a rattlesnake
if someone held its head 
  no offense 
  no  none taken 
  dad had thousands of women 
  yeah  well  one of them was mine 
  what s that got to do with me 
  his rancid blood runs through your veins 
and that stupid grin of his is
plastered all over your arrogant face 
where s my cocaine 
i flushed it down the toilet 
  that was ten kilos 
  at least 
honestly  i thought it was more 
so  you kill my men 
you steal my coke 
over a goddamn woman 
it s called love  sweetheart 
you should try it sometime 
now  are we done 
or do you want
to keep on chatting  skippy

how you do it  fellas 
that s how you go out strong 
kehoe precinct

and white bull that you asked for   
i got all the files here 
you re the best 
wasn t easy 
thank you 
can you email them over 
i could  or i could drive them up and
put them right into your warm hands 
 course  it s a three hour drive 
so i need a place to stay the night 
well  there s always my place 
but  here s the thing 
i really need to spend
all night with those files 
now  if you were to shoot them
right over to me 
i could probably be done
with them by tonight 
and then i could put all my pent
up energy into something else 
hmm  okay  well 
you got them  baby  bang 
right in your inbox 
oh  they re right in there 
so  how do we wanna do this 
i m thinking you leave the
door open and your lights off 
trust me to find   
hold on a second  what was that 
  i said   
  oh god  we got an avalanche 
i gotta call you back 
oh  hey  gip 
yes 
do i look like
a homeless guy to you 
thirty years ago   
i lived in a hole in the ground below
the house of the guy that dealt me drugs 
one day  he came to me 
stuck out his hand 
i took it 
and we made a deal 
it was a good deal 
not a great deal 
i should have bought a casino
like my brother 
but a deal is a deal 
and i honored it 
that honor   
was repaid with butchery 
they took my only son 
today   
my boy will make
his final journey home 
we will stay 
take our revenge 
i will have blood for blood 
a son for a son 
hi 
  goddamn it 
  you forgot 
what 
  what 
  the bullying seminar 
oh  god 
  every other parent was there 
  you re right  i forgot about the bullying seminar 
but i m allowed to forget 
you know why 
because i wrote a check
for a new computer center 
you write a check  you get to skip on
150 bullying seminars  that s the math 
that s one of the perks
of my business 
you re not a businessman 
trevor  you re a criminal 
my powder s not good enough for you anymore 
i remember when it was plenty good enough 
when you used
to roll around in it

a little bit of my powder   
made you buck like a bronco 
goddamn 
close those beautiful
brown eyes of yours 
see if it all
comes back to you 
they needed a host for next week s
fundraiser  i signed you up

what is it you think we might
do to viking or to white bull 
take them out  save our town 
we got a little problem
to solve

we hung an innocent indian
from a road sign

not gonna like that 
so  has anyone got any ideas on
how we might set things right

one little screw up shouldn t
make us their bitches 
so we send them a short note

bit more oomph  something from our heart 
yeah  cut off his head 
stick it in a box and send it to them 
tell them he s the culprit 
tell them our old arrangement s
back in effect and good to go 
get that shit away from me  man
