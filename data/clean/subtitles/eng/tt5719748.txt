im going to make
some phone calls
find out what happened to kyle
she thinks youre one
of the guys from the old days
dont worry about her
kyle he got mixed up with some
clown by the name of dante
and they stole
a kilo of coke from viking
whos viking
drug dealer a big one
you know him
yeah when he was a snotnosed kid
i knew his old man bullitt
dad knew him too
whenever bullitt had rough stuff to be done
that was his goto guy after dad me
and then viking took over
vikings a whole
different breed
he likes hurting people
im gonna kill him brock
sure you are
what makes you think
you can kill a man
ive
ive killed three of his guys
what did you do with the bodies
wrapped them in chicken wire
threw them on the gorge
chicken wire
yeah to let the fish get at them
theyll eat the flesh
off the bones
so the bodies dont fill
with gas and rise
they stay at the bottom
where did you learn that
i read it in a crime novel
he is my brother
brother
my ass
i know
maybe i should
shut up
you stay out of trouble
the things we do for love huh
she was skimming the till
at a massage parlor
they sent me to beat the shit
out of her instead
hows grace
she left
the ladys got good timing
ill give her that
how do i find this viking
you dont
youve gone as far up the ladder as youre gonna go
well see
one guy can disappear
two i dont think so
three with ten keys of coke
maybe they were
all in it together
you think three of my dealers
ran out on me
that would make me the worst judge of
character in the rockies thats your theory
no
no
it was those goddamn indians
this is all my fathers fault
for getting into bed with them
im sorry the indians
when vikings father
was first getting started
he made a deal with an
indian named white bull
he supplied him white bull
dealt on the reservation
until white bull
wanted more turf
so he tossed white bull a few piece of crap towns
like kehoe
and kehoe builds a ski resort
turns it into a gold mine
whats the one thing
historys taught us
you keep those indians
on the reservation
those indians
theyre always wanting more
because they think the turf
was theirs all along
might kinda have
a point there right
white bull gave this
to my father
the day they shook
on their deal
yeah
its time we give it
back to him
what can i do for you two
you could sit down with us
tell us your story
i got other customers
yeah thats funny
all i can see in here is you
please tell me you work nights
thursdays why
you look this good in sunlight
i gotta see you after dark
eggs bacon pancakes
and for you
surprise me
okay
i was 13 when my dad kicked it
you know his last words to me
try to bang every waitress
who ever serves you
this indian is
taking forever to show up
so tell me
about this motel trick of yours
twenty bucks
its not a trick all right
its a beautiful invention its an invention
steve jobs would have been proud of
steve jobs huh
thats right
you know what made that guy
such a genius simplicity
lets hear it already
all right
i stay in motels
100 nights a year right
first thing every morning i hang a
clean the room sign on the doorknob
maid sees the sign
she opens the door
now pay attention
to the details here
all the hard thought
behind them
im lying on top of the covers
stone naked
first crucial part
i look into the maids eyes all right
if i dont she backs right outta that
door its over before it even starts
i take the twenty
i lay it right on my jimmy
boom
just a twenty
maids make 835 an hour
and theyve got miserable lives too
thats the totally
underrated part of this
the ball is completely
in her court
she could back out of that door
no harm no foul
or she could come and get it
whats your success rate
thirtyone percent
hundred motels a year
you do the math
hes got the same little
yellow gloves white bull wears
is that an indian thing
i guess
its good
thats steve fucking jobs good
i see one flaw quality control
im paying her 20 bucks
im not asking for miss america
still theres no way theres 31 maids
in the whole country worth banging
youd be surprised
oh dear
been at it all night
havent gotten a thing out of him
and you wont
you know pain
its like a religion
to these guys
you know the apaches used to consider
getting tortured a mark of honor
hows that for a value system
hes a ute
what now
local indians are utes
not apache
you know i married an indian
dont you think i know the difference
this doesnt happen
in kehoe
it just did
it was his first run
just one run papa
he says to me
i can do it
im your son
what are we going to do
okay lets go home to denver
mr coxman
im very sorry for your loss
thanks
hey
so
here you go
thanks
exboyfriend of mine works vice in denver
so i gave him a call today
because you missed him and
wanted to see how he was doing
well he still thinks
theres a chance for us
whats his name
kurt
how long were you two lovers
oh jesus two months okay
i had him look up the forensics
on our sign hanger
the guys name is simon legrew
now his father is white bull
hes a native american
drug dealer from denver
whos been dealing coke
around here for 30 years
so now white bull
shares territory with viking
hes a denver drug dealer whose
real name is trevor calcote
so
im thinking
what we have here is a turf war
a drug turf war
right here in kehoe
so what are we gonna
do about it
well my 30 years experience tells
me that this is a job for denver vice
it doesnt bother you that i just
learned more about a local drug lord
in five minutes on the phone
than youve learned in 30 years
what bothers me is that kurts lying in bed
tonight convinced that hes back in your heart
kurts a big boy
i knew youd be back
all right vikings real name
is trevor calcote
if you want him dead
youre gonna have to hire a hit man
a hit man
yeah an assassin
do you know one
the eskimo
so how does this work
you buy the eskimo a train ticket
hes afraid to fly
you pick him up at the train
station you drive him to a motel
where you give him
half the money upfront
and then you go home
how do i know when its done
keep checking the denver post
they cant resist
a good rub out
what is it with all these nicknames
speedo viking eskimo
the eskimo
its a gangster thing
did you have a nickname
yeah wingman
wingman
yeah from top gun
as in you can be my wingman
wingman
come on
i tried buddy
some real music please
what do you want to hear
anything else
just no kanye
take it out of his tip
theres a convention in town
this is all i could get
this is only half
thats right
are you a cop
no
the reason i ask is cops are
always a year behind the street
but the street knows its twothirds
upfront onethird when the deal is done
but cops they still think
its half and half
okay we can do twothirds
were gonna get along
just fine
yes
yes ten grand ten grand baby
ten grand
that jet touchdown
just beat your browns
whatever happened to loyalty
sometimes loyalty
comes at a price
and besides
my grandmothers from brooklyn
so why dont you
give her a cut
yeah
says hes the eskimo
says he has information
you wanna buy
lets hear him out
ive been offered
ninety grand to ice you
to ice me
you wanna ice a guy you go to the eskimo
well that works for me
who knew white bull
had that kind of coin
white bulls an indian
indians dont farm out their kills
so if it wasnt white bull
then who the hell was it
thats what im selling
well how much
ninety grand
you gotta love
the symmetry there
you are one hell
of a businessman
i tries
try its a singular
do we have a deal
course we got a deal
deposit the money into
this cayman islands account
when it hits you get the name
goody
i like working with pros
cuts way down
on the bullshit factor
yeah so
who wants me dead
guys name is coxman
coxman
there was a coxman
on dads payroll right
what was his name he called
himself uh wing ding
ringworm wing ding
wingman
wingman
wingman
wingman wants me dead why
the why of it aint my
business so i dont aks
ask
i think our business here is done
so it is
hey can i ask two questions
if i may
one pro to another
shoot
why do they call you the eskimo
comes from the brothers
in the hood
any nigga crazy enough
to move up to snow country
has gotta be a fucking eskimo
thats youre funny
second question
all right its
who taught you your ethics
come again
you made a deal to kill me for 90
grand and you didnt honor that deal
its because
im honoring this one
yeah
guess a mans word doesnt
matter in the hood right
guess its just every man
for himself in there
you see out here
character counts
without character there can be
no business and
without business
well
what the hell
would we do all day
would you mind
stepping off the rug
is this what you call
an eskimo roll
im thinking ireland
maybe germany
yeah for what
my ten grand vacation
oh
yeah well
guinness over becks any day
then dublin it is
youre gonna take me to dublin
yeah
hey
mustang if we get caught out
wingman
how the hell you been
wed like you to come
for a little ride
okay wingman
tell me about the eskimo
i guess you just dont get
what you pay for anymore
some of us do
oh yeah
well what about speedo
and limbo and santa
how did those guys
work out for you huh
okay now before you die
youre gonna tell me
what this is all about
the only question is
how much pain do you wanna endure
i got cancer of the ass dickweed
so screw you and screw your pain
you wanna know
what this is all about
its about bullitt
my father
lying piece of shit
stole my woman
dad banged anything
with a hole
hey bone what is it
you used to say about him
hed bang a rattlesnake
if someone held its head
no offense
no none taken
dad had thousands of women
yeah well one of them was mine
whats that got to do with me
his rancid blood runs through your veins
and that stupid grin of his is
plastered all over your arrogant face
wheres my cocaine
i flushed it down the toilet
that was ten kilos
at least
honestly i thought it was more
so you kill my men
you steal my coke
over a goddamn woman
its called love sweetheart
you should try it sometime
now are we done
or do you want
to keep on chatting skippy
nah
okay wingman
see thats
how you do it fellas
thats how you go out strong
kehoe precinct
yeah just a sec kim
yeah
denver vice
kurt hi
so that deep dive into viking
and white bull that you asked for
i got all the files here
youre the best
wasnt easy
thank you
can you email them over
i could or i could drive them up and
put them right into your warm hands
course its a threehour drive
so i need a place to stay the night
well theres always my place
but heres the thing
i really need to spend
all night with those files
now if you were to shoot them
right over to me
i could probably be done
with them by tonight
and then i could put all my pent
up energy into something else
hmm okay well
you got them baby bang
right in your inbox
oh theyre right in there
so how do we wanna do this
im thinking you leave the
door open and your lights off
trust me to find
hold on a second what was that
i said
oh god we got an avalanche
i gotta call you back
oh hey gip
yes
do i look like
a homeless guy to you
thirty years ago
i lived in a hole in the ground below
the house of the guy that dealt me drugs
one day he came to me
stuck out his hand
i took it
and we made a deal
it was a good deal
not a great deal
i should have bought a casino
like my brother
but a deal is a deal
and i honored it
that honor
was repaid with butchery
they took my only son
today
my boy will make
his final journey home
we will stay
take our revenge
i will have blood for blood
a son for a son
hi
goddamn it
you forgot
what
what
the bullying seminar
oh god
every other parent was there
youre right i forgot about the bullying seminar
but im allowed to forget
you know why
because i wrote a check
for a new computer center
you write a check you get to skip on
150 bullying seminars thats the math
thats one of the perks
of my business
youre not a businessman
trevor youre a criminal
my powders not good enough for you anymore
i remember when it was plenty good enough
when you used
to roll around in it
ah
see i remember when just
a little bit of my powder
made you buck like a bronco
goddamn
close those beautiful
brown eyes of yours
see if it all
comes back to you
they needed a host for next weeks
fundraiser i signed you up
here
three of vikings drug dealers
have disappeared in the last week
tell me who viking is again
the denver drug lord
white bulls rival
let me ask you a question
what is it you think we might
do to viking or to white bull
take them out save our town
we got a little problem
to solve
we
we hung an innocent indian
from a road sign
and my guess is white bulls
not gonna like that
so has anyone got any ideas on
how we might set things right
yeah maybe we should apologize
yeah
one little screw up shouldnt
make us their bitches
so we send them a short note
hey and what does
this uh short note say
i dont know how about
sorry about tonto
wont happen again
no
im thinking we need something with a
bit more oomph something from our heart
yeah cut off his head
stick it in a box and send it to them
tell them hes the culprit
tell them our old arrangements
back in effect and good to go
get that shit away from me man
what the hells wrong with you
weve got some of the best pot
stores in the world man all legal
but no instead you choose to
smoke that dang reservation weed
