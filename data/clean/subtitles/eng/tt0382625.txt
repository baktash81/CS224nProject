what is not rightfully yours 
i don t know what
you are talking about 
is it a secret you will die for 
  please 
  as you wish 
wait 
my god  forgive me 
in the sacristy   
   the church of saint sulpice 
is the rose line 
beneath the rose 
thank you 
symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past 
as the saying goes 
a picture says a thousand words   
   but which words 
interpret for me  please  this symbol 
first thing that comes to mind 
  hatred  racism 
  ku klux klan 
yes  yes  interesting  but they would
disagree with you in spain 
there  they are robes
worn by priests 
now this symbol  anyone 
evil 
in english  please 
devil s pitchfork 
poor  poor poseidon 
that is his trident  a symbol of power
to millions of the ancients 
now this symbol 
  madonna and child 
  faith  christianity 
no  no  it s the pagan god
horus and his mother  isis   
   centuries before
the birth of christ 
understanding our past
determines actively   
   our ability to understand
the present 
so how do we sift truth from belief 
how do we write our own histories 
personally or culturally   
   and thereby define ourselves 
how do we penetrate years 
centuries  of historical distortion   
   to find original truth 
tonight  this will be our quest 
i still think that his whole take on phi
was a little far fetched 
i don t think so  i think that the
golden ratio is everywhere in nature 
sure  i can do that 
my son is a student
of yours at harvard 
  michael culp  he adores you 
  oh  yeah 
he says you re the best teacher
he s ever had 
ms  culp  i think i already gave
michael an a minus 
he told me  thank you 
mr  langdon 
hi 
bonjour  professor 
i m lieutenant collet from dcpj 
a kind of french fbi 
will you take a look
at this photo  please 
my police chief  capitaine fache 
had hoped   
   considering your expertise
and the markings on the body   
   you might assist us 
will you excuse me a moment 
i was supposed to have
drinks with him 
yes  we know 
we found your name
in his daily planner 
he never showed 
i waited for over an hour 
why would someone do this to him 
oh  you misunderstand  professor 
he was shot  yes 
but what you see
in the photograph   
   monsieur saunière did to himself 
teacher  all four are dead 
the sénéchaux and the
grand master himself 
then i assume
you have the location 
confirmed by all 
independently 
i had feared the priory s penchant
for secrecy might prevail 
the prospect of death
is strong motivation 
it is here 
in paris  teacher 
it hides beneath the rose
in saint sulpice 
you will go forth  silas 
i chastise my body 
capitaine fache is waiting for you 
okay 
  mr  langdon 
  yes 
i m captain bezu fache 
you like our pyramid 
it s magnificent 
a scar on the face of paris 
after me  please 
it s the pairing
of those two pyramids 
it s unique 
the two are geometric echoes 
fascinating 
i m not sure how much help
i m gonna be here this evening 
how well did you know the curator 
not at all  we met only once 
we were on a   
on a panel together 
something is funny 
we didn t agree on much 
frankly  i was surprised
when he contacted me 
could we take the stairs 
so saunière requested
tonight s meeting 
yes 
how  did he call you 
e  mail  he heard i was in paris 
had something to discuss 
what 
you seem uncomfortable 
  are any of those real 
  of course not 
so you know something
of security procedures 
well  i know video surveillance in
a museum this size is cost prohibitive 
most now rely on containment 
yes  forget about
keeping the criminals out 
now we keep them in 
the grand gallery 
this is where you found the body 
how would you know that 
i recognize the parquet floor
from the polaroid  it s unmistakable 
dear god 
let s cover the talking points again 
your eminence 
many call opus dei
a brainwashing cult 
others  an ultraconservative
christian secret society 
  we are a simple catholic church 
  simple 
with a brand new  47 million
headquarters in manhattan 
our followers are generous 
should we apologize for that 
perhaps a less defensive tack 
your eminence 
the press continue
to be harsh with us 
we are not cafeteria catholics 
we don t pick and choose
which rules to follow 
we follow doctrine  rigorously 
does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity  tithing   
   and atonement for sins through
self flagellation and the cilice 
many of our followers are married 
many of them have families 
only a small proportion
choose to live ascetically   
   in the cloisters
of our residential halls 
but we are all united in god s work
around the world 
surely that is an admirable way
to lead one s life 
why are some media referring
to opus dei as  god s mafia  
obviously  some people fear
what they don t understand 
and because the war finally
draws to a close 
  bishop  we need to stay on message 
  that will be all  michael  thank you 
aringarosa 
silas has succeeded 
the legend is true 
it hides beneath the rose 
my part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled 
i meet the council in an hour 
i will have your money tonight 
teacher 
the vitruvian man 
it s one of leonardo da vinci s
most famous sketches 
and the star on his skin 
a pentacle 
and its meaning 
the pentacle is ancient 
symbols carry different meanings
in different settings 
this symbol  professor 
this setting 
the pentacle is
a pagan religious icon 
devil worship 
no  no  no  no 
the pentacle before that 
this is a symbol for venus 
it represents the female half
of all things 
it s a concept called  the divine
goddess  by religious historians 
you are telling me that
saunière s last act on earth   
   was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest  why 
captain fache 
obviously i can t tell you why 
i can tell you he  as well as anyone 
knows the meaning of this symbol   
   and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil 
  is that so 
  yes 
then   
   what do you make of this 
 o  draconian devil 
oh  lame saint  
it s a phrase 
doesn t mean anything  not to me 
what would you do if you had such
limited time to send a message 
well  i suppose
i d try to identify my killer 
precisely 
so  professor   
officer neveu 
please  pardon the interruption 
this is not the time 
i received the crime scene jpegs
at headquarters   
   and i ve deciphered the code 
it s a fibonacci sequence 
that s the code saunière
left on the floor 
headquarters sent me
to explain  captain 
it is the fibonacci sequence 
the numbers are out of order 
but before that  i have an urgent
message for professor langdon 
right 
pardon me 
i m sophie neveu 
french police  cryptology 
your embassy called division 
i m sorry  monsieur  they said
it was a matter of life and death 
this is the number of your
embassy s messaging service 
well  thank you 
hello  you ve reached
the home of sophie neveu 
miss neveu  this   
no  that s the right number 
you have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages 
but i m getting   
it s a three digit code 
it s on the paper i gave you 
professor langdon 
do not react to this message 
you must follow my directions
very closely and  above all   
   reveal nothing to captain fache 
you are in grave danger 
church of saint sulpice 
good evening  sister 
i need you to show someone
our church tonight 
of course  father 
but so late 
wouldn t tomorrow    
this is a request from an
important bishop of opus dei 
it would be my pleasure 
there s been an accident  a friend 
i have to fly home in the morning 
i see 
is there a restroom i could use  i just
wanna splash some water on my face 
yes 
she said it is meaningless 
mathematical joke 
is it meaningless 
i ll take another look
when i come back 
i m sorry  of course 
do you have a message
from saunière 
what are you talking about 
crazy old man 
you have me confused with
someone else 
i was asked to come here
and consult 
no  you are
sous surveillance cachée 
yes  and   
what 
bring the suspect to the crime scene
and hope he incriminates himself 
suspect 
check your jacket pocket 
just look 
gps tracking dot 
accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe 
the agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket   
   in case you tried to run 
we have you on a little leash 
professor 
why would i try to run 
i didn t do anything 
so  what do you think about
the fourth line of text   
   fache wiped clean
before you arrived 
he brought you here to force a
confession  professor langdon 
he s still in there 
what s he doing 
fache isn t even looking
for other suspects  okay 
he is sure you re guilty 
when did saunière contact you 
  today 
  yes  yes 
what time  what time 
at 3  around 3  three 
the gallery alarm was triggered at 8 
you were   
  i was giving a lecture 
  at 9 
you had the privacy light on
in your hotel room until 8 30  right 
we call fache  the bull  
once he starts  he doesn t stop 
he can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case 
and by then whatever saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless 
stop it  just stop 
who are you 
what are you talking about 
tell you what 
maybe who really killed him 
the fibonacci sequence 
i believe saunière wrote it   
   so his investigation would
include cryptographers 
that s quite a leap  isn t it 
no 
and the letters 
 p s  
p s   postscript 
 princess sophie  
yeah  silly  i know 
but i was only a girl
when i lived with him 
jacques saunière
was my grandfather 
apparently  it was his dying wish
that we meet 
if you help me understand why   
   i will get you to your embassy 
where we cannot arrest you 
fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here  was he 
no 
if we are to get away from here 
we must find another way 
what exactly do you propose 
saunière was reading his book 
 blood trail  
excuse me  captain 
crypto called 
they identified the code 
neveu told us already 
i should have fired her on the spot 
barging in like that 
yes 
except they didn t send neveu 
what 
captain  look at this 
he jumped 
shit 
he s moving again  and fast 
he must be in a car 
he s going south
on pont du carrousel 
bastard 
that cop will check
the whole lower floor 
i will only take a moment 
of course 
he is much older than i remember 
i hadn t seen or spoken to him
in a very long time 
he phoned my office today 
several times 
he said it was a matter
of life and death 
i thought it was another trick
to get back in touch 
it seems when
he couldn t speak to me   
   he reached out to you 
whatever he needed
so badly to say   
   he found neither of us in time 
  wait a minute 
  professor 
come on 
it can t be that easy 
this is wrong 
yeah  see  this is wrong 
the fibonacci numbers only
make sense when they re in order 
these are scrambled 
if he was trying to reach out 
maybe he was doing it in code 
would you hold this  please 
this phrase is meaningless 
unless you assume these letters
are out of order too 
an anagram 
you have eidetic memory 
not quite  but i can pretty much
remember what i see 
anagram is right 
 o  draconian devil  oh  lame saint 
becomes 
 leonardo da vinci 
the mona lisa  
professor  the mona lisa
is right over here 
look at this  he must have
thrown it from the window 
smart to hit the truck 
what  you admire him now 
we re stupid 
who did we leave at the museum 
ledoux  get him on the radio 
her smile is in
the lower spatial frequencies 
the horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right 
why 
well  see  she appears larger
from the left than on the right 
historically  the left was female 
the right was male 
the sacred feminine 
why do you say that 
something saunière said
the first time we came here 
there  blood 
hey 
 so dark the con of man  
no  it doesn t say that 
is it another anagram 
can you break it 
professor  hurry  hurry 
moon  sermon  charms 
demons  omens  codes 
monks  ranks  rocks 
madonna of the rocks 
da vinci 
careful  careful 
this can t be this  the fleur de lis 
stay where you are 
let go of the painting   
   and put it on the ground 
no  you put your gun down 
now 
or else i will destroy the painting 
hurry up 
slide your gun to me 
be careful 
i never really liked this painting 
run 
it was saunière s 
i remember finding it once
when i was a girl 
he d promised
he d give it to me one day 
have you ever heard
those words before  sophie 
 so dark the con of man  
no  have you 
when you were a child  were you
aware of any secret gatherings 
anything ritualistic in nature 
meetings your grandfather
would ve wanted kept secret 
was there ever any talk of something
called the priory of sion 
the what  why are you
asking these things 
the priory of sion is a myth 
one of the world s oldest and most
secret societies  with leaders like   
   sir isaac newton 
da vinci himself 
the fleur de lis is their crest 
they re guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to   
   as  the dark con of man  
but what secret 
the priory of sion protects
the source of god s power on earth 
i can t do this by myself 
i m in enough trouble as it is 
that s my embassy 
please 
even if we could get out of this   
okay 
no  no  no  you re not gonna make it 
you re not gonna make it 
well  that was   
we won t last long in this car 
fache doesn t like to be eluded 
even on a good day 
we need to get out of sight 
christ  give me strength 
you are a ghost 
christ  give me strength 
stealing in a house of god 
you are an angel 
christ  give me strength 
you have powerful friends 
bishop aringarosa
has been kind to me 
i could not miss this chance
to pray inside the saint sulpice 
a pity you couldn t wait for morning 
the light is not ideal 
tell me  sister  please 
of the rose line 
a rose line is any line that goes from
the north to south poles 
set into the streets of paris 
135 brass markers   
   mark the world s
first prime meridian   
   which passed through
this very church 
it hides beneath the rose 
i m sorry 
sister 
i do not want to keep you 
i will show myself out 
i insist 
may the peace of the lord
be with you 
and with you 
gray smart car  black roof 
corner of denain boulevard
at the train station 
how could you let them get away 
why not just shoot the damn painting 
imbecile 
you should put his cigar
out in your hand 
get out of here 
they found neveu s car
abandoned at the train station 
and two tickets to brussels paid for
with langdon s credit card 
a decoy  i m sure 
all the same 
send an officer to the station 
question all the taxi drivers 
i ll put this on the wire 
interpol  we re not sure he s guilty 
i know he s guilty  beyond a doubt 
robert langdon is guilty 
this is the bois de boulogne 
we should be safe in this park
for a few minutes 
your police don t patrol this park 
stay here 
police 
what do you want 
fifty euros for all your stuff 
go and get something to eat 
did it occur to you
that could be dangerous 
no  and now we have
a place to think 
any ideas  professor 
you could ve just handed me
a piece of a ufo from area 51 
 what s the next step  
with him  it s always 
 sophie  what s the next step  
puzzles 
codes 
a treasure hunt 
to find his killer 
maybe there is something
about this priory of sion 
i hope not 
any priory story ends in bloodshed 
they were butchered by the church 
it all started over a thousand
years ago when a french king   
   conquered the holy city
of jerusalem 
this crusade  one of the most
massive and sweeping in history   
   was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood   
   the priory of sion   
   and their military arm 
the knights templar 
but the templars were created
to protect the holy land 
that was a cover to hide their
true goal  according to this myth 
supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact   
   lost since the time of christ 
an artifact  it was said 
the church would kill to possess 
did they find it 
this buried treasure 
put it this way 
one day the templars
simply stopped searching 
they quit the holy land
and traveled directly to rome 
whether they blackmailed
the papacy   
   or the church bought their silence 
no one knows 
but it is a fact the papacy
declared these priory knights   
   these knights templar 
of limitless power 
by the 1300s  the templars
had grown too powerful 
too threatening 
so the vatican
issued secret orders   
   to be opened simultaneously
all across europe 
the pope had declared the
knights templar satan worshipers   
   and said god had charged him with
cleansing the earth of these heretics 
the plan went off like clockwork 
the templars
were all but exterminated 
the date was october 13th  1307 
a friday 
friday the 13th 
the pope sent troops
to claim the priory s treasure   
   but they found nothing 
the few surviving
knights of the priory had vanished   
   and the search for their
sacred artifact began again 
what artifact  i ve never
heard about any of this 
yes  you have 
almost everyone on earth has 
you just know it as the holy grail 
please  saunière thought he knew
the location of the holy grail 
maybe more than that 
this cross and the flower 
this could be very old  but look 
this metal here underneath is much
newer  and there s a modern id stamp 
 haxo 24  
and these dots 
these dots are read by a laser 
this is more than a pendant 
this is a key your grandfather left you 
he left us  professor 
and vingt quatre haxo 
it s not an id stamp 
it s a street address 
this is jacques saunière 
please leave a message
after the tone 
please  monsieur saunière 
pick up the phone 
this is sandrine bieil 
i have called the list 
i fear the other guardians are dead 
the lie has been told 
the floor panel has been broken 
please  monsieur  pick up the phone 
i beg you 
job 38  verse 11 
do you know it  sister 
job 38 11 
hitherto shalt thou come   
   but no further 
 but no further  
do you mock me 
where is the keystone 
i do not know 
no 
you are a sister of the church   
   and yet you serve them 
the priory 
jesus had but one true message 
that   
come  you saints of god 
hasten  angels of the lord 
to receive her soul 
and bring her to the sight
of the almighty 
in the name of the father 
the son  and the holy spirit 
welcome  bishop 
may christ be with you 
and also with you 
it s been too long  manuel 
i saw your press conference 
very priestly 
vultures 
but you need a good cover
to fly into italy these days 
so how are things in rome 
we serve at his pleasure 
today is today 
but there are many tomorrows 
vatican cellars 
1976 
seventy six  a year of independence 
how fitting 
i thought you d like it 
i ll fetch the others 
welcome  bishop 
this council is convened 
our words shall never
pass these walls 
what business  say you 
as you know  my request for funds   
yes  20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds 
a tad more than petty cash 
wouldn t you say  bishop 
the endeavor is complex 
freedom has a high cost 
and  of course  you will deliver us 
how fortunate we are 
i only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men 
how humble 
our savior  bishop aringarosa 
were we to grant your request   
   when would
this mission commence 
  actually  tonight 
  what 
  it has begun 
  we have not agreed 
how dare you presume to   
i do not presume  i act 
the vatican s unwillingness
to support us   
   is both impious and cowardly 
blood is being spilled because true
christian values lie in ruins  no more 
this council has forgotten
its very purpose 
tonight   
   the grail will be destroyed 
the priory s few remaining members
will be silenced 
i was contacted by a man
who calls himself only  the teacher  
he knows a great deal
about this council 
and about the priory 
two prostitutes identified
langdon and neveu   
   getting into a taxi
in the bois de boulogne 
because of your expertise 
  i m sorry 
  about the priory 
do you think that s why
saunière sought you out 
i can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it 
actually  i didn t think
he liked me very much 
once made a joke at my expense 
got a big laugh out of it 
what was it 
how may i help you 
the door to the right  please 
that was quite a performance 
the little shit should know better
than to play politics with me 
i know i got in front of you 
old friend 
i did what i thought was best 
so   
   now what 
now we wait for the teacher s call 
good evening  i am andré vernet 
the night manager 
i take it this is your first visit
to our establishment 
yes 
understood 
keys are often passed on
and first time users   
   are sometimes
uncertain of protocol 
keys are essentially
numbered swiss accounts 
often willed through generations 
is it yours  mademoiselle 
the shortest safety deposit box
lease is 50 years 
and what s your longest account 
quite a bit longer 
technologies change 
keys are updated 
but our accounts date back
to the beginning of banking itself 
once the computer
confirms your key   
   enter your account number
and your box is retrieved 
the room is yours 
as long as you like 
what if i lost track
of my account number 
how might i recover it 
i m afraid each key is paired
with a 10 digit number   
   known only to the account bearer 
i hope you manage to remember it 
a single wrong entry
disables the system 
  ten 
  ten 
your grandfather s
fibonacci sequence 
scrambled  unscrambled 
unscrambled 
it s your key 
funny  i don t even like history 
i ve never seen much good come
from looking to the past 
moment of truth 
my god  i don t believe this 
a rose 
the rose was a symbol
for the holy grail 
forgive the intrusion 
i m afraid the police arrived
more quickly than i anticipated 
you must follow me  please 
for your own safety 
you knew they were coming 
my guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived 
yours is one of our oldest
and highest level accounts 
it includes a safe passage clause 
safe passage 
if you would step inside  please 
time is of the essence 
in there 
hey  is there a problem 
good evening  sir  police 
i just drive from here to zurich 
not french  english 
  english 
  yes 
we are looking for two criminals 
you came to the right place 
they re all criminals here 
would you mind opening the hold 
please  you think they trust us 
the wages i get paid 
you don t have keys
to your own truck 
it s armored 
keys get sent to the destination 
you mind  i m on a schedule here 
and do all the drivers wear a rolex 
what 
this piece of shit 
forty euros in barbès 
yours for 35 
no  no  no 
  thirty 
  no  it s okay  it s okay 
come on  30  eh 
i said  no 
move along 
now we wait 
the teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money 
you have put tremendous faith
in this teacher of yours 
yes  i have  and i have given him
an angel to do his will 
for surely there is no better
soldier for god than my silas 
i firmly resolve  with the help of
thy grace  to confess my sins   
   to do penance
and to amend my life 
amen 
i chastise my body 
the holy grail 
a magic cup 
the source of god s power on earth 
it s nonsense 
you don t believe in god 
no 
i don t believe in some magic
from the sky 
just people 
sometimes that they can be kind 
and that s enough 
well  i think it has to be 
i think it s all we have 
are you a god fearing man 
professor 
i was raised a catholic 
well  that s not really an answer 
professor  are you okay 
go ahead  open it 
go on 
a cryptex 
they are used to keep secrets 
it s da vinci s design 
you write the information
on a papyrus scroll   
   which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar 
if you force it open  the vial breaks   
   vinegar dissolves papyrus   
   and your secret is lost forever 
the only way
to access the information   
   is to spell out the password   
   with these five dials 
each with 26 letters 
that s 12 million possibilities 
i ve never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex 
saunière made one for me once 
my grandfather gave me a wagon 
this clearly is not the holy grail 
come on 
please  you re not all right 
may i try something 
i don t know why it works 
my mother used to do it
when i was scared  i think 
you think 
yes 
feeling better  sophie 
my parents died in a car crash
with my brother 
i was 4 
i m sorry 
it was many years ago 
better 
yeah 
okay 
twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box   
   and now it s you two murderers 
bring it to me 
i don t know what
you re talking about 
all right  okay 
right now 
step back 
no one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree 
turn around 
turn around 
you too  mademoiselle 
sophie 
get in the truck 
i ll drive  hurry 
  better 
  always  if i got too nervous   
   i had to put my head out
of the window not to be sick 
saunière used to say
i was like a dog 
a cute dog  you know  a little dog 
what happened between you
and your grandfather  sophie 
i ve jammed my shoulder 
i ve been shot at  i m bleeding 
i need to know 
you say he raised you 
but you two don t talk anymore 
you call him by his last name 
you say you hate history 
nobody hates history 
they hate their own histories 
so now you re a psychologist too 
what if saunière had started
to groom you for the priory 
what do you mean  groom me 
your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child 
say saunière was hoping one day
you would join him in the priory 
still  years later 
when he imagines   
   the grail is in danger 
he reaches out to you 
so you are saying all this is real 
the priory  the holy grail 
we ve been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real 
  real enough to kill for 
  who 
i m out of my field here 
i do know a grail historian 
absolutely obsessed with priory myth 
an englishman 
lives here in france 
do you trust this man 
i hope you can 
vernet  andré 
it seems you re not a driver at all 
apparently  you lost your tongue
along with your truck 
aiding and abetting
two murder suspects 
that carries jail time 
speak to my lawyer 
all this confusion  violence 
vanishing property   
it might get around that your bank is
less than ideal  don t you think 
you think you re in pain now 
andré vernet 
my cause is worth your life 
understand 
what do you want 
your truck carries a homing device 
activate it 
please wait 
i ll see if he s available 
it s on the wrong side 
leigh likes all things to be english 
including his cars 
robert  do i owe you money 
leigh  my friend   
   care to open up
for an old colleague 
  of course 
  thank you 
but first  a test of honor 
three questions 
fire away 
your first 
shall i serve coffee or tea 
tea  of course 
excellent 
second  milk or lemon 
milk 
that would depend on the tea 
correct 
and now the third
and most grave of inquiries 
in which year did a harvard sculler
outrow an oxford man at henley 
surely such a travesty
has never occurred 
your heart is true 
you may pass 
welcome to château villette 
leigh teabing has spent
his entire life   
   studying the grail 
that thing is one hot tamale 
sorry 
the cryptex  it s a hot coal 
a hot potato 
so you want to keep our chest
close to our cards  yes 
very close 
the truck s signal is coming online 
it s about time 
locked on and tracking  sir 
very good  tell collet not to move in
until i get there 
attention  all of collet s units
to château villette 
the suspects neveu and langdon
are likely at that location 
aringarosa 
i still don t know why
he put you into this   
   and i m sorry 
but   
   i m also very glad 
you are requested
to make yourself at home 
robert 
and you travel with a maiden 
it seems 
sir leigh teabing 
may i present miss sophie neveu 
sophie  sir leigh teabing 
it s an honor to welcome you   
   even though it s late 
thank you for having us 
i realize it s quite late 
so late  mademoiselle 
it s almost early 
what a lovely smile you have 
earl grey 
lemon 
correct 
château villette  yes 
  no 
  oh  you must 
remy is from lyons 
but nevertheless   
   he is fantastic with sauces 
  thank you 
  no  i can t 
a dramatic late night arrival 
mention of life and death 
what can an old cripple
do for you  robert 
we wanna talk about
the priory of sion 
the keepers 
the secret war 
sorry for all the mystery 
leigh  i m into something here
that i cannot understand 
you 
  really 
  not without your help 
playing to my vanity  robert 
you should be ashamed 
not if it works 
there are always four 
the grand master
and the three sénéchaux   
   make up the primary
guardians of the grail 
thank you  remy 
that ll be all for now 
the priory s members
span our very globe itself 
philippe de chérisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967 
and that is what
they want you to believe 
the priory is charged
with a single task 
to protect the greatest secret
in modern history 
the source of god s power
on earth 
no  that s a common
misunderstanding 
the priory protects the source
of the church s power on earth 
the holy grail 
i don t understand 
what power  some magic dishes 
robert  has he been telling you
that the holy grail is a cup 
to understand the holy grail 
my dear   
   you must first understand
the holy bible 
the good book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven 
the bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man 
the pagan emperor constantine 
i thought constantine
was a christian 
oh  hardly  no 
he was a lifelong pagan   
   who was baptized
on his deathbed 
constantine was rome s
supreme holy man 
from time immemorial   
   his people had worshiped a balance
between nature s male deities   
   and the goddess 
or sacred feminine 
but a growing religious turmoil
was gripping rome 
three centuries earlier   
   a young jew named jesus
had come along   
   preaching love and a single god 
centuries after his crucifixion   
   christ s followers
had grown exponentially   
   and had started a religious war
against the pagans 
or did the pagans commence war
against the christians 
leigh  we can t be sure who began
the atrocities in that period 
we can at least agree that the
conflict grew to such proportions   
   that it threatened
to tear rome in two 
so constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan   
   but he was also a pragmatist 
and in 325 anno domini   
   he decided to unify rome under
a single religion  christianity 
christianity was on the rise 
he didn t want his empire torn apart 
and to strengthen this new
christian tradition   
   constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering   
   known as the council of nicaea 
and at this council   
   the many sects of christianity
debated and voted on  well   
   everything  from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels   
   to the date for easter   
   to the administering
of the sacraments  and of course   
   the immortality of jesus 
i don t follow 
well  ma chère 
until that moment in history   
   jesus was viewed by many of his
followers as a mighty prophet   
   as a great and powerful man 
but a man nevertheless 
a mortal man 
some christians held
that jesus was mortal 
some christians believed
he was divine 
not the son of god 
not even his nephew twice removed 
hold on  you re saying
jesus  divinity came from a vote 
well  remember  in those days 
gods were everywhere 
by infusing jesus the man
with the divine magic   
   by making him capable
of earthly miracles   
   as well as his own resurrection 
constantine turned him into a god   
   but within the human world 
and he basically knocked the more
distant gods out of the game 
constantine did not create
jesus  divinity 
he simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea 
  semantics 
  no  it s not semantics 
you re interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions 
fact  for many christians  jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next 
for some christians 
his divinity was enhanced 
absurd  there was a formal
announcement of his promotion 
they couldn t even agree
on the nicene creed 
excuse me 
 who is god  who is man  
how many have been murdered
over this question 
as long as there has been
a one true god   
   there has been killing
in his name 
now let me show you the grail 
this used to be the ballroom 
i have little occasion to dance
these days 
i trust you recognize
the last supper   
   the great fresco by
leonardo da vinci 
now  my dear 
if you would close your eyes 
oh  leigh  save us the parlor tricks 
you asked for my help  i recall 
allow an old man his indulgences 
now  mademoiselle 
where is jesus sitting 
  in the middle 
  good 
he and his disciples
are breaking bread 
and what drink 
wine  they drank wine 
splendid  and one final question 
how many wineglasses
are there on the table 
one  the holy grail 
open your eyes 
no single cup 
no chalice 
well  that s a bit strange  isn t it 
considering both the bible
and standard grail legend   
   celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the holy grail 
now  robert 
you could be of help to us 
if you d be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman  please 
no balloon animals 
i can make a great duck 
this is the original icon for male 
it s a rudimentary phallus 
  quite to the point 
  yes  indeed 
this is known as the blade 
it represents aggression
and manhood 
it s a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms 
yes  the more penises you have  the
higher your rank  boys will be boys 
now  as you would imagine  the
female symbol is its exact opposite 
this is called the chalice 
and the chalice resembles a cup
or vessel or  more importantly   
   the shape of a woman s womb 
no  the grail has never been a cup 
it is quite literally this ancient
symbol of womanhood 
and in this case  a woman who
carried a secret so powerful   
   that if revealed  it would devastate
the very foundations of christianity 
wait  please 
you re saying the holy grail
is a person  a woman 
and it turns out  she makes
an appearance right there 
but they are all men 
are they 
what about that figure
on the right hand of our lord   
   seated in the place of honor 
flowing red hair 
folded feminine hands 
hint of a bosom  no 
it s called scotoma 
the mind sees what it chooses to see 
who is she 
my dear  that s mary magdalene 
the prostitute 
she was no such thing 
smeared by the church
in 591 anno domini  poor dear 
mary magdalene was jesus  wife 
this is an old wives  tale 
the original one  in fact 
there s virtually no empirical proof 
he knows as well as i do
there s much evidence to support it 
theories  there are theories 
notice how jesus and mary
are clothed 
mirror images of each other 
the mind sees
what it chooses to see 
and venturing into the even more
bizarre  notice how jesus and mary   
   appear to be joined at the hip and
are leaning away from each other   
   as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them 
leonardo gives us the chalice 
yes  oh  and robert 
notice what happens   
   when these two figures
change position 
just because da vinci painted it
doesn t make it true 
no  but history   
   she does make it true 
now  listen to this  it s from
the gospel according to philip 
philip 
yes  it was rejected
at the council of nicaea   
   along with any other gospels
that made   
   jesus appear human
and not divine 
 and the companion of the savior
is mary magdalene 
christ loved her more
than all the disciples   
   and used to kiss her on the    
but this says nothing of marriage 
well  actually   
robert 
actually  in those days  the word
 companion  literally meant  spouse  
and this is from the gospel
of mary magdalene herself 
  she wrote a gospel 
  she may have 
  robert  will you fight fair 
  she may have 
 and peter said 
 did he prefer her to us  
and levi answered 
 peter  i see you contending
against a woman like an adversary 
if the savior made her worthy 
who are you  indeed  to reject her   
yes  and then  my dear  jesus
goes on to tell mary magdalene   
   that it s up to her
to continue his church 
mary magdalene  not peter 
the church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman 
few realize that mary was descended
from kings  just as her husband was 
now  my dear  the word
in french for holy grail 
from the middle english
 sangreal    
   of the original arthurian legend 
now  as two words 
can you translate for our friend 
sang real  it means  royal blood  
when the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of christ   
   it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried jesus  royal bloodline 
but how could christ
have a bloodline  unless    
mary was pregnant
at the time of the crucifixion 
for her own safety and for that
of christ s unborn child   
   she fled the holy land
and came to france 
and here  it is said 
she gave birth to a daughter  sarah 
they know the child s name 
  a little girl 
  yes 
if that were true 
it s adding insult to injury 
why 
the pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female 
people found god through sex 
in paganism  women were worshiped
as a route to heaven   
   but the modern church
has a monopoly on that   
   in salvation through jesus christ 
and he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world 
women  then  are a huge threat
to the church 
the catholic inquisition
soon publishes   
   what may be the most
blood soaked book in human history 
the malleus maleficarum 
the witches  hammer 
it instructed the clergy on how
to locate  torture and kill   
   all freethinking women 
in three centuries of witch hunts   
   50 000 women are captured 
burned alive at the stake 
oh  at least that 
some say millions 
imagine  then  robert   
   that christ s throne
might live on in a female child 
you asked what would
be worth killing for 
witness the greatest cover up
in human history 
this is the secret
that the priory of sion   
   has defended
for over 20 centuries 
they are the guardians
of the royal bloodline 
the keepers of the proof
of our true past 
they are the protectors of the living
descendants of jesus christ   
   and mary magdalene 
sir leigh 
sometimes i wonder
who is serving whom 
his sauces are not that fantastic 
yes  can i help you 
yes  they re on the news now 
living descendants  is it possible 
it s not impossible 
you have not been honest with me 
your pictures are on the television 
you are wanted for four murders 
that s why vernet said
 killing spree  
you come into my home 
playing on my passions for the grail 
  that s why he needed you 
  you will leave my house 
  leigh  listen 
  no  i m calling the police 
jacques saunière
was her grandfather 
you re the obsessive priory scholar 
you still keep lists
of who might be in the priory 
i ll bet jacques saunière
was on one of those lists 
he was on your list of who could
be grand master  wasn t he 
  what 
  i ll bet he was right at the top 
consider  four men murdered 
the same number as the guardians 
what if the priory was compromised 
the other sénéchaux dead 
what if you yourself were dying 
a grand master 
you d have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust 
someone outside the society 
maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished 
robert  your ruse is pathetic 
not really 
no  that s impossible 
can that really    
is it the keystone 
i ll even show it to you  leigh 
will you just tell us
what the hell it s for 
fache says to wait  so i wait 
what s fache thinking 
the truck is here  they re inside 
yes 
as the legend foretold 
 it hides beneath the rose  
oh  my 
leigh 
leigh 
please 
i m sorry  yes  of course 
inside the keystone   
   there ll be a map 
a map that will lead us
to the holy grail 
to be trained by
the grand master himself 
did he pass down the fleur de lis 
is that how you found this 
and he must have sung you
the riddle songs 
i know some of them 
can you keep secrets 
can you know a thing
and never say it again 
and codes 
i imagine they lie down
for you like lovers 
a sénéchal  a guardian of the grail
right here in my own home 
tell him  please 
i don t know any of this 
leigh  it s not that simple 
she doesn t rem   
robert 
do not move  woman 
cripple 
put the box on the table 
what  this trifle 
well  perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement 
put the keystone on the table 
you will not succeed 
only the worthy
can unlock the stone 
rip the gate down 
well  well  my dear 
sit down 
  are you okay 
  yeah  yeah 
  are you 
  yeah 
yes  well  make yourself useful 
you french fool 
get something
to restrain this monster 
above the joint 
fortunately 
a dragon most easy to slay 
he s wearing a cilice 
  a what 
  well  look 
inflicts pain so he can suffer
as christ suffered 
not so common these days 
opus dei 
remy  take care of this 
fache is opus dei 
the policeman who s chasing us 
he wears the cross in the world 
robert 
well  i must say 
you two are anything but dull 
leigh 
you want what s in this box 
we need a way out of here 
well  actually   
   i do have a plane 
  robert  where do we go 
  come along 
  in here  come in 
  over here 
get the door  hurry 
over here  over here  sophie 
watch out 
be careful 
come  rem   
shit 
easy 
jesus 
apropos 
i can t imagine
what your complaint is 
i d be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods 
put that away  we might need him 
better 
opus dei 
  what is it 
  a conservative catholic sect 
opus dei is a prelature
to the vatican 
you re saying the vatican
is killing people for this box 
no  no  no  not the vatican   
   and not opus dei 
but we are in the middle of a war 
and one that has been
going on forever 
on the one side stands the priory   
   and on the other
an ancient group of despots   
   with members hidden
in high ranking positions   
   throughout the church 
and this council of shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline 
and that throughout history 
they seek out and kill   
   the living descendants
of jesus christ 
  that s insane 
  is it 
how many atrocities and scandals
has the catholic church   
   rationalized in its time 
and what happens   
   if some persuasive scientific
evidence emerges that shows   
   that the church s version of christ
is inaccurate 
what if the world discovers   
   that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie 
the vatican faces a crisis of faith
unprecedented 
i ve got a signal now  sir 
it s ringing 
roger  look  i m so sorry  i ve got
tired of the weather here in france   
   and could you make
the plane ready for   
   zurich 
yes  no  we love zurich 
what the hell do you mean 
you lost them  collet 
you re the one who lost them 
you control every step of this investigation 
you don t let anybody breathe 
you re acting like
you lost your mind 
what is it with these two birds 
interpol just registered a new
flight plan from le bourget 
stay out of my way on this  collet 
did you kill jacques saunière 
i am the messenger of god 
did you kill my grandfather 
i am the messenger   
each breath you take is a sin 
no shadow will be safe again 
for you will be hunted by angels 
you believe in god 
your god doesn t
forgive murderers 
he burns them 
sophie 
the teacher will be pleased 
what will you do
once you have the grail 
destroy it 
the documents and the
sarcophagus  of course 
and the heir 
will you exercise the final edict 
spill his blood 
there will be no need 
once the sarcophagus is destroyed 
dna testing will be impossible 
there is no way to prove
a living bloodline 
but if you had to   
   would you do as councils
have done before us 
christ   
christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity 
so  too  may be the fate of his seed 
robert 
when we land  you must go
straight to your embassy 
is that so 
don t you see it 
they never wanted you 
maybe even fache didn t 
it s all about this   
   idiotic little box 
that s not too flattering 
crazy old man 
why leave me with this 
i should just throw it away 
he trusted you  sophie 
a guardian of the holy grail 
it sounds so stupid 
it s quite an honor 
if you think about it   
   and take it seriously 
he took it seriously enough
to get himself killed 
not him  you 
he was the only family i knew 
and maybe i didn t know him at all 
i m his marionette  robert 
like a girl again 
just with no gift at the end 
but you ve done enough 
i don t know why saunière
picked me to help you  sophie 
but i won t leave you alone
in all this 
two marionettes  then 
maybe this is why he chose you 
because you will stay 
i need the flight plan 
ten minutes 
i asked you to get it for me 
i m on break 
come back in 10 minutes 
my nose  my nose 
the flight plan  please 
you asshole 
it s not  cross  
 spear  
what happened to her 
no one knows 
mary magdalene lived out
her days in hiding 
and the zealots pursued her still   
   even in death  trying to destroy
proof of her existence 
but she always had her knights 
brave men sworn to defend her 
you see  to worship
before her sarcophagus   
   to kneel before the bones
of mary magdalene   
   was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power   
   who were oppressed 
ultimately  the priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline   
   until most believed
her sarcophagus   
   the holy grail   
   was finally lost in time 
what are you doing 
at the chateau  you said 
 it hides beneath the rose  
no  no  no  do be careful 
in latin  sub rosa 
literal translation   
 beneath the rose  
we need a mirror 
backwards  in the style
of leonardo himself 
thank you 
in london lies a knight
a pope interred
his labor s fruit
a holy wrath incurred
you seek the orb
that ought be on his tomb
it speaks of rosy flesh
and seeded womb
 in london lies a knight
a pope interred  
a knight whose funeral
was presided over by the pope 
of course  the priory knights
were not just any knights 
templars 
and there s just one place to bury
a templar knight in london 
temple church 
temple church 
if you ll excuse me  my dear   
   roger and i must discuss
a change in flight plan 
leigh 
harboring and transporting
fugitives 
you are already implicated enough 
you and i  robert 
have observed history 
time has been our glass 
we are in history now  living it 
making it 
 implicated  
i am on a grail quest 
forgive me  robert   
   but you two may well
have given this old man   
   the greatest night of his life 
thank you 
he s going to want more money 
i suppose this is a new technique
for investigations 
i ve lost them 
they flew to switzerland 
no extradition 
the controller filed charges 
ari was on dispatch  he called me 
what s going on  bezu 
you know that i am opus dei 
yes 
a bishop of my order called me 
he said a killer
came to him in confession 
his name was robert langdon 
he said i couldn t imagine
the evil in this man s heart 
that he would keep killing 
he said i had to stop him 
the bishop broke his vows
to tell me this 
he charged me
to stop robert langdon 
tell me  collet  who have i failed 
the bishop 
god himself 
they ve changed their flight plan
to london 
go on  fache 
i ll take care of the controller 
maybe he needs a few extra euros 
just tell me next time 
i have them  tower  relay hawker
to land and hold on tarmac 
  secure the area 
  wider 
  armed police 
  you two  round the back 
armed police 
put your hands in the air 
  three men up 
  ready 
put your hands in the air  do it now 
i m afraid that s
easier said than done in my case 
oh  good morning 
did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me 
sir  the french police say
you re transporting fugitives   
   and you may have
a hostage onboard 
i m to take you all into custody 
sadly  i have an important medical
appointment which i can t miss 
i ll fetch the car  sir 
this is serious  sir  the french police
are on their way  stop 
inspector  i can t afford the time
to indulge your games 
i m late and i m leaving 
if it s so important
for you to stop us   
   then you re just going
to have to shoot us 
you can start with him 
search the plane 
all right 
i could run them over 
bad tip 
let him go 
the french cannot be trusted 
everyone comfy 
biscuits 
they didn t notice anything 
well  people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes  don t you find 
do you have the bonds  bishop 
yes  i do  teacher 
i have chosen an opus dei
residence for the exchange 
i am honored 
by the time you get to london 
i will have the grail 
  i take it the news is good  then 
  i fly to london 
the teacher is waiting for me there 
he has chosen a house of opus dei
to make the exchange 
mere currency
for the location of the grail 
imagine it 
remember  if we are discovered by
the vatican  we are excommunicated 
  so should anything go wrong   
  yes  i know  i know 
this council does not exist 
as it never has 
old friend  heaven protect you 
keep an eye out for the police 
i must say  robert 
i m quite impressed   
   by the way you withstood
my little aeroplane 
did he never tell you 
when he was a boy 
young robert fell into a well 
how old were you 
seven 
treading water all night long 
screaming his lungs out   
   to the echoes screaming back 
when they found him 
he was nearly catatonic 
help 
it was a long time ago 
oh  now  now  robert 
you above all people shouldn t be one
to dismiss the influence of the past 
temple church 
i always forget it s right here 
built 1185 and modern london
just sprang up right around it 
tell me  why has the priory kept the
grail location secret all these years 
i don t know 
some say the priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself   
   which is especially odd   
   since legend suggests he may not
know his own true identity 
hello 
why do they make them so scary 
oh  it s cold 
 in london lies a knight
a pope interred  
so which tomb has an orb 
those knights
with their legs crossed   
   means they d been
to the holy land 
two wear tunics over their armor   
   and two have full length robes 
two are grasping swords 
and one    two are praying 
this one has his arms at his sides 
oh  and this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely 
i don t see any orb
that ought be on a tomb 
 ought be on his tomb  
are we looking for a missing orb 
maybe 
these aren t tombs 
  what  yes  of course they are 
  no 
  they re effigies 
  what 
not tombs  there s no bodies here 
this place is wrong 
can we go now  we should go 
sophie  no

just let her go  and you and i can   
we ll come to some agreement 
remy

let s see if we can access
the database on this 
 in london lies a knight
a pope interred  
compounding keywords 
knight  pope  grail 
your precious treasure was
almost lost  and with it  my fortune 
can you believe how well i did 
i even convinced the monk 
i should be in theater 
a toast to our success  teacher 
the end of the journey is near 
your identity shall go
with me to the grave 
there s your problem  mate 
it s your basic linguistic coincidence 
see  keywords keep coming up
with the writings   
   of some bloke named
alexander pope 
 a  pope  
your grandfather was a genius 
come on 
emergency 
which service do you require 
i know the location of two murderers
wanted by french police 
we ve just had a 999 call 
triangulation leads back
to docklands 
caller was male 
claimed your two murderers   
   are hiding at an opus dei house 
the knight we re looking for
is sir isaac newton 
his life s work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the church 
gravity  for god sakes 
and if you choose to believe   
   he was also a grand master
of the priory as well 
but if he offended
the catholic church   
   the pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral 
well  that s where i got it wrong 
 in london lies a knight
a pope interred  
sir isaac newton s funeral
was presided over   
   by his good friend 
his colleague  alexander pope 
a  pope  his first initial 
how did i miss that 
here 
yes  isaac newton s tomb 
an orb 
yes  which one  it s not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing 
 an orb with rosy flesh
and seeded womb  
solar system  the planets 
constellations  signs of the zodiac 
see  our moon is missing 
the moons of saturn and jupiter 
they re not here 
eyes of the cherubs themselves 
robert  these tracks 
look at the cane marks in the dust 
teabing was here 
he was alone 
when the two of you
arrived at my home as you did   
   others might call it god s will 
i believed that if i had the cryptex   
   i could solve the riddle alone 
but i was unworthy 
but you   
you have a reason to be here 
you re the last remaining
guardian of the grail 
your grandfather
and the other sénéchaux   
   would not have lied
with dying breath   
   unless they knew
their secret was preserved 
how could you know
saunière s last words 
leigh 
grail quests require sacrifice 
you are a murderer 
no  no  robert  tell her 
when history is written 
murderers are heroes 
you self righteous bastard 
we need to just walk away 
  no  don t  don t 
  walk away 
i ll do what i have to now 
anything 
do you understand 
so now   
   can t we all be friends again 
this way 
i m going to put this gun down 
i only want you both to listen 
i m listening now 
for 2000 years   
   the church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind   
   crushed passion and idea alike 
all in the name of their walking god 
proof of jesus  mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering   
   drive this church of lies
to its knees 
armed police 
drop your weapon 
stop  silas 
we are betrayed  my son 
the living heir must be revealed 
jesus must be shown
for what he was 
not miraculous  simply man 
i m sorry 
armed police 
drop your weapon  drop it  drop it 
put it down now  put it down 
i am a ghost 
the dark con can be exposed 
mankind can finally be set free 
and we can do it  robert 
the three of us 
how is silas 
is he     is he alive 
the monk 
bishop  how would you know
this killer s name 
get me out of here  fache 
wait 
langdon never came to you
in confession  did he 
one of your followers called you
about the crime scene photos 
i cannot be implicated here  there are
still important works to be done 
you used me 
god uses us all 
help me  fache 
take him 
  did you get his cell phone 
  yes  sir 
i m going to need a trace 
your silas is dead 
the priory s sacred charge   
   was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium 
the millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden 
the priory failed
in their sacred charge 
so  what choice did i have 
i sought out the enemy 
i persuaded them  the council
of shadows  that i was an ally 
i even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me 
rector  i made them call me 
 teacher  
  why don t you and i   
  no 
robert  no words  on your knees 
do it 
no  i mean it  down 
not you  no  my dear  you   
you re my miracle  sophie 
you re the guardian of the grail 
all the oppression of the poor
and the powerless   
   of those of different skin 
of women 
you can put an end to all that 
you must explode the truth
onto the world 
it s your duty 
you know the answer to this riddle 
open the cryptex   
   and i ll put down the gun 
i have no idea how 
i don t know the code 
and even if i did  i wouldn t tell you 
like your grandfather  then 
willing to die for your secret 
but by the way you ve been
looking at your hero   
   i wonder  would you
let him die for you 
open it  sophie  to save his life 
  leigh  you can t just   
  open the cryptex 
i don t know how 
open it or he dies 
  i swear  i don t know 
  do it  do it 
  stop it 
  i don t know 
stop it 
she can t do it  leigh 
but give me a moment 
robert 
what are you doing 
please 
i m sorry 
no 
no  robert 
no 
no 
oh  the map  it s ruined 
the map is ruined 
the grail 
it s lost 
the grail is gone 
only the worthy
find the grail  leigh 
you taught me that 
armed police 
drop it  drop your weapon 
put the gun down 
that one  the old man 
you re under arrest 
you do not have to say anything 
but it may harm your defense   
   if you do not mention 
when questioned   
   something which you
later rely on in court 
anything you do say
will be given in evidence 
i ll have some questions for you 
big crowd out there now 
thank you for your statements 
you are free to go  of course 
i m sorry  you thought
he was your friend  no 
it wasn t only us  was it 
he used you too 
leave us  please 
i should have been smarter 
i acted on faith  i suppose 
i m sorry 
how many 
your grandfather  the other three 
maybe more 
the monk was given to teabing
as a gift  it seems 
to do as he asked 
teabing killed the servant himself 
you know 
  remy 
  yes 
by poison 
how much of it
have you been able to figure out 
some  not enough for it
to make sense 
it won t ever make sense 
i m sorry 
he forgot everything we ve learned 
everything we teach 
it s why we study history 
so we ll stop killing each other 
robert  robert  robert 
how could you do it 
how could you  robert 
to destroy our hope of freedom 
to deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the magdalene 
how could you 
you couldn t  you solved it 
you took the scroll out
before it broke 
you solved it  oh  you ll find it  robert 
you ll find it  you know what to do 
you ll find the grail 
you ll kneel before her   
   and you ll set her free
upon the world 
that man there 
he s got the map to the holy grail 
there was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one 
the orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired newton s life s work 
work that incurred the wrath
of the church until his dying day 
a  p  p  l  e 
apple 
the holy grail  neath
ancient roslin waits
the blade and chalice
guarding o er her gates
adorned in masters 
loving art  she lies
she rests at last
beneath the starry skies
i think i know where she s gone 
i think the grail has gone home 
built by the templars themselves 
named for the original rose line 
rosslyn chapel 
so this is it 
the gift at the end 
 the holy grail  neath
ancient roslin waits  
you never told me the joke
saunière made of you 
what was it 
he called me a flatfoot 
a beat cop of history 
oh  a dumb policeman   
   who just does his job
day after day  of history 
you know  his father was one 
a policeman 
saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known 
we are who we protect  i think 
what we stand up for 
jewish   
   christian  egyptian   
   masonic  pagan   
   templar crosses   
   pyramids 
i think i ve been here before 
sophie 
a very long time ago 
come along  sophie 
sophie 
over here 
 the blade and chalice
guarding o er her gates  
pagan symbols for
male and female 
fused as one 
as the pagans would have wanted 
we re about to close  i m afraid 
we re just gonna be a moment 
robert 
i ve never seen that before 
the style is   
it s unmistakable 
these could have been painted by
leonardo da vinci 
 adorned in masters 
loving art  she lies  
 she rests at last
beneath the starry skies  
the fleur de lis 
she was here 
her sarcophagus 
mary magdalene 
the holy grail herself 
she was here 
with modern dna testing 
those bones   
   could have shown definitive proof
of a bloodline 
where did she go 
did the church finally get her 
this is incredible  look at this 
look at this  these records
go back thousands of years 
they date back
to the death of christ 
good god  could these
really be the grail documents 
what did he want from us 
to find her sarcophagus 
how was i ever supposed
to figure all this out 
when you and your
grandfather fought   
   was it something about your past 
how could you know that 
about how your parents died 
sophie 
it was during primary school 
i was in his library 
doing research 
i was trying to find out
about my family 
sophie  where are you  princess 
i wanted to know about them 
but i couldn t find any records 
not of their death   
   not of the accident 
i d asked him for as long
as i could remember   
   but he would never tell me 
i told you  no 
but why can t i 
he stood over me   
   and he wouldn t let me leave 
they re dead  dead and buried 
never look for them  sophie 
promise me 
swear it 
swear it to me 
i kept my promise 
the next week he sent me
to boarding school 
one weekend
i came home unexpectedly 
and what i saw
my grandfather doing   
some ritual 
i was so frightened 
we hardly ever spoke again 
do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the accident 
before your parents were killed 
yeah  no  i don t know 
why 
because i don t think
he was your grandfather 
these are my parents 
my brother 
and this is you  isn t it 
the paper says
the entire family was killed 
the mother  the father  the boy  6   
   and the girl  4 
but your name was never saunière 
it s saint clair 
it s one of the oldest families
in france 
it s from a line of the
merovingian kings 
royal blood 
i was so wrong 
saunière didn t want you to help guard
the secret of the holy grail 
sophie   
   you are the secret 
you survived the accident 
if it even was an accident 
the priory found out 
somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive 
they hid you with the
grand master himself   
   who raised you as his own 
according to all of this   
   princess sophie   
   you are the heir 
the end of the bloodline 
you are the last living descendent   
   of jesus christ 
what is this 
sophie 
who are you 
there have been many names 
the keepers 
guardians 
the priory of sion 
but to you  sophie  we are friends
of the man who raised you 
jacques saunière 
he would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much 
and that the priory are here
to protect you now   
   as they have always
protected our family 
i gave you up once   
   knowing i might
never see you again 
i m your grandmother  sophie 
i have prayed for this moment
for a very long time 
welcome home  child 
hey 
no more strings 
his last breath to keep me safe 
she has some things
she wants to tell me 
about my family 
what will you do 
the legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself 
they just got the pronoun wrong 
she said when saunière died   
   he took the location
of mary s sarcophagus with him 
so there s no way to empirically prove
that i am related to her 
what would you do  robert 
okay  maybe there is no proof 
maybe the grail is lost forever 
but  sophie  the only thing that
matters is what you believe 
history shows us
jesus was an extraordinary man   
   a human inspiration  that s it 
that s all the evidence
has ever proved 
but   
   when i was a boy   
when i was down in that well
teabing told you about   
   i thought i was going to die 
sophie 
what i did   
   i prayed 
i prayed to jesus to keep me alive   
   so i could see my parents again   
   so i could go to school again   
   so i could play with my dog 
sometimes i wonder
if i wasn t alone down there 
why does it have to be
human or divine 
maybe human is divine 
why couldn t jesus
have been a father   
   and still been capable
of all those miracles 
like turning water into wine 
well  who knows 
his blood is your blood 
maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again 
maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands 
and maybe you re
a knight on a grail quest 
well  here s the question 
a living descendent
of jesus christ   
   would she destroy faith 
or would she renew it 
so again i say  what matters
is what you believe 
thank you 
for bringing me here 
for letting him choose you   
   sir robert 
you take care 
yes 
hey 
nope 
maybe i ll do better with the wine 
godspeed
