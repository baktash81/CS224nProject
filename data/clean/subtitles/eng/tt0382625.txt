what is not rightfully yours
i dont know what
you are talking about
is it a secret you will die for
please
as you wish
wait
my god forgive me
in the sacristy
the church of saintsulpice
is the rose line
beneath the rose
thank you
symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past
as the saying goes
a picture says a thousand words
but which words
interpret for me please this symbol
first thing that comes to mind
hatred racism
ku klux klan
yes yes interesting but they would
disagree with you in spain
there they are robes
worn by priests
now this symbol anyone
evil
in english please
devils pitchfork
poor poor poseidon
that is his trident a symbol of power
to millions of the ancients
now this symbol
madonna and child
faith christianity
no no its the pagan god
horus and his mother isis
centuries before
the birth of christ
understanding our past
determines actively
our ability to understand
the present
so how do we sift truth from belief
how do we write our own histories
personally or culturally
and thereby define ourselves
how do we penetrate years
centuries of historical distortion
to find original truth
tonight this will be our quest
i still think that his whole take on phi
was a little farfetched
i dont think so i think that the
golden ratio is everywhere in nature
sure i can do that
my son is a student
of yours at harvard
michael culp he adores you
oh yeah
he says youre the best teacher
hes ever had
ms culp i think i already gave
michael an aminus
he told me thank you
mr langdon
hi
bonjour professor
im lieutenant collet from dcpj
a kind of french fbi
will you take a look
at this photo please
my police chief capitaine fache
had hoped
considering your expertise
and the markings on the body
you might assist us
will you excuse me a moment
i was supposed to have
drinks with him
yes we know
we found your name
in his daily planner
he never showed
i waited for over an hour
why would someone do this to him
oh you misunderstand professor
he was shot yes
but what you see
in the photograph
monsieur saunière did to himself
teacher all four are dead
the sénéchaux and the
grand master himself
then i assume
you have the location
confirmed by all
independently
i had feared the priorys penchant
for secrecy might prevail
the prospect of death
is strong motivation
it is here
in paris teacher
it hides beneath the rose
in saintsulpice
you will go forth silas
i chastise my body
capitaine fache is waiting for you
okay
mr langdon
yes
im captain bezu fache
you like our pyramid
its magnificent
a scar on the face of paris
after me please
its the pairing
of those two pyramids
its unique
the two are geometric echoes
fascinating
im not sure how much help
im gonna be here this evening
how well did you know the curator
not at all we met only once
we were on a
on a panel together
something is funny
we didnt agree on much
frankly i was surprised
when he contacted me
could we take the stairs
so saunière requested
tonights meeting
yes
how did he call you
e mail he heard i was in paris
had something to discuss
what
you seem uncomfortable
are any of those real
of course not
so you know something
of security procedures
well i know video surveillance in
a museum this size is costprohibitive
most now rely on containment
yes forget about
keeping the criminals out
now we keep them in
the grand gallery
this is where you found the body
how would you know that
i recognize the parquet floor
from the polaroid its unmistakable
dear god
lets cover the talking points again
your eminence
many call opus dei
a brainwashing cult
others an ultraconservative
christian secret society
we are a simple catholic church
simple
with a brandnew 47million
headquarters in manhattan
our followers are generous
should we apologize for that
perhaps a less defensive tack
your eminence
the press continue
to be harsh with us
we are not cafeteria catholics
we dont pick and choose
which rules to follow
we follow doctrine rigorously
does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity tithing
and atonement for sins through
selfflagellation and the cilice
many of our followers are married
many of them have families
only a small proportion
choose to live ascetically
in the cloisters
of our residential halls
but we are all united in gods work
around the world
surely that is an admirable way
to lead ones life
why are some media referring
to opus dei as gods mafia
obviously some people fear
what they dont understand
and because the war finally
draws to a close
bishop we need to stay on message
that will be all michael thank you
aringarosa
silas has succeeded
the legend is true
it hides beneath the rose
my part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled
i meet the council in an hour
i will have your money tonight
teacher
the vitruvian man
its one of leonardo da vincis
most famous sketches
and the star on his skin
a pentacle
and its meaning
the pentacle is ancient
symbols carry different meanings
in different settings
this symbol professor
this setting
the pentacle is
a pagan religious icon
devil worship
no no no no
the pentacle before that
this is a symbol for venus
it represents the female half
of all things
its a concept called the divine
goddess by religious historians
you are telling me that
saunières last act on earth
was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest why
captain fache
obviously i cant tell you why
i can tell you he as well as anyone
knows the meaning of this symbol
and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil
is that so
yes
then
what do you make of this
o draconian devil
oh lame saint
its a phrase
doesnt mean anything not to me
what would you do if you had such
limited time to send a message
well i suppose
id try to identify my killer
precisely
so professor
officer neveu
please pardon the interruption
this is not the time
i received the crimescene jpegs
at headquarters
and ive deciphered the code
its a fibonacci sequence
thats the code saunière
left on the floor
headquarters sent me
to explain captain
it is the fibonacci sequence
the numbers are out of order
but before that i have an urgent
message for professor langdon
right
pardon me
im sophie neveu
french police cryptology
your embassy called division
im sorry monsieur they said
it was a matter of life and death
this is the number of your
embassys messaging service
well thank you
hello youve reached
the home of sophie neveu
miss neveu this
no thats the right number
you have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages
but im getting
its a threedigit code
its on the paper i gave you
professor langdon
do not react to this message
you must follow my directions
very closely and above all
reveal nothing to captain fache
you are in grave danger
church of saintsulpice
good evening sister
i need you to show someone
our church tonight
of course father
but so late
wouldnt tomorrow
this is a request from an
important bishop of opus dei
it would be my pleasure
theres been an accident a friend
i have to fly home in the morning
i see
is there a restroom i could use i just
wanna splash some water on my face
yes
she said it is meaningless
mathematical joke
is it meaningless
ill take another look
when i come back
im sorry of course
do you have a message
from saunière
what are you talking about
crazy old man
you have me confused with
someone else
i was asked to come here
and consult
no you are
sous surveillance cachée
yes and
what
bring the suspect to the crime scene
and hope he incriminates himself
suspect
check your jacket pocket
just look
gps tracking dot
accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe
the agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket
in case you tried to run
we have you on a little leash
professor
why would i try to run
i didnt do anything
so what do you think about
the fourth line of text
fache wiped clean
before you arrived
he brought you here to force a
confession professor langdon
hes still in there
whats he doing
fache isnt even looking
for other suspects okay
he is sure youre guilty
when did saunière contact you
today
yes yes
what time what time
at 3 around 3 three
the gallery alarm was triggered at 8
you were
i was giving a lecture
at 9
you had the privacy light on
in your hotel room until 830 right
we call fache the bull
once he starts he doesnt stop
he can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case
and by then whatever saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless
stop it just stop
who are you
what are you talking about
tell you what
maybe who really killed him
the fibonacci sequence
i believe saunière wrote it
so his investigation would
include cryptographers
thats quite a leap isnt it
no
and the letters
ps
ps postscript
princess sophie
yeah silly i know
but i was only a girl
when i lived with him
jacques saunière
was my grandfather
apparently it was his dying wish
that we meet
if you help me understand why
i will get you to your embassy
where we cannot arrest you
fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here was he
no
if we are to get away from here
we must find another way
what exactly do you propose
saunière was reading his book
blood trail
excuse me captain
crypto called
they identified the code
neveu told us already
i should have fired her on the spot
barging in like that
yes
except they didnt send neveu
what
captain look at this
he jumped
shit
hes moving again and fast
he must be in a car
hes going south
on pont du carrousel
bastard
that cop will check
the whole lower floor
i will only take a moment
of course
he is much older than i remember
i hadnt seen or spoken to him
in a very long time
he phoned my office today
several times
he said it was a matter
of life and death
i thought it was another trick
to get back in touch
it seems when
he couldnt speak to me
he reached out to you
whatever he needed
so badly to say
he found neither of us in time
wait a minute
professor
come on
it cant be that easy
this is wrong
yeah see this is wrong
the fibonacci numbers only
make sense when theyre in order
these are scrambled
if he was trying to reach out
maybe he was doing it in code
would you hold this please
this phrase is meaningless
unless you assume these letters
are out of order too
an anagram
you have eidetic memory
not quite but i can pretty much
remember what i see
anagram is right
o draconian devil oh lame saint
becomes
leonardo da vinci
the mona lisa
professor the mona lisa
is right over here
look at this he must have
thrown it from the window
smart to hit the truck
what you admire him now
were stupid
who did we leave at the museum
ledoux get him on the radio
her smile is in
the lower spatial frequencies
the horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right
why
well see she appears larger
from the left than on the right
historically the left was female
the right was male
the sacred feminine
why do you say that
something saunière said
the first time we came here
there blood
hey
so dark the con of man
no it doesnt say that
is it another anagram
can you break it
professor hurry hurry
moon sermon charms
demons omens codes
monks ranks rocks
madonna of the rocks
da vinci
careful careful
this cant be this the fleurdelis
stay where you are
let go of the painting
and put it on the ground
no you put your gun down
now
or else i will destroy the painting
hurry up
slide your gun to me
be careful
i never really liked this painting
run
it was saunières
i remember finding it once
when i was a girl
hed promised
hed give it to me one day
have you ever heard
those words before sophie
so dark the con of man
no have you
when you were a child were you
aware of any secret gatherings
anything ritualistic in nature
meetings your grandfather
wouldve wanted kept secret
was there ever any talk of something
called the priory of sion
the what why are you
asking these things
the priory of sion is a myth
one of the worlds oldest and most
secret societies with leaders like
sir isaac newton
da vinci himself
the fleurdelis is their crest
theyre guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to
as the dark con of man
but what secret
the priory of sion protects
the source of gods power on earth
i cant do this by myself
im in enough trouble as it is
thats my embassy
please
even if we could get out of this
okay
no no no youre not gonna make it
youre not gonna make it
well that was
we wont last long in this car
fache doesnt like to be eluded
even on a good day
we need to get out of sight
christ give me strength
you are a ghost
christ give me strength
stealing in a house of god
you are an angel
christ give me strength
you have powerful friends
bishop aringarosa
has been kind to me
i could not miss this chance
to pray inside the saintsulpice
a pity you couldnt wait for morning
the light is not ideal
tell me sister please
of the rose line
a rose line is any line that goes from
the north to south poles
set into the streets of paris
135 brass markers
mark the worlds
first prime meridian
which passed through
this very church
it hides beneath the rose
im sorry
sister
i do not want to keep you
i will show myself out
i insist
may the peace of the lord
be with you
and with you
gray smart car black roof
corner of denain boulevard
at the train station
how could you let them get away
why not just shoot the damn painting
imbecile
you should put his cigar
out in your hand
get out of here
they found neveus car
abandoned at the train station
and two tickets to brussels paid for
with langdons credit card
a decoy im sure
all the same
send an officer to the station
question all the taxi drivers
ill put this on the wire
interpol were not sure hes guilty
i know hes guilty beyond a doubt
robert langdon is guilty
this is the bois de boulogne
we should be safe in this park
for a few minutes
your police dont patrol this park
stay here
police
what do you want
fifty euros for all your stuff
go and get something to eat
did it occur to you
that could be dangerous
no and now we have
a place to think
any ideas professor
you couldve just handed me
a piece of a ufo from area 51
whats the next step
with him its always
sophie whats the next step
puzzles
codes
a treasure hunt
to find his killer
maybe there is something
about this priory of sion
i hope not
any priory story ends in bloodshed
they were butchered by the church
it all started over a thousand
years ago when a french king
conquered the holy city
of jerusalem
this crusade one of the most
massive and sweeping in history
was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood
the priory of sion
and their military arm
the knights templar
but the templars were created
to protect the holy land
that was a cover to hide their
true goal according to this myth
supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact
lost since the time of christ
an artifact it was said
the church would kill to possess
did they find it
this buried treasure
put it this way
one day the templars
simply stopped searching
they quit the holy land
and traveled directly to rome
whether they blackmailed
the papacy
or the church bought their silence
no one knows
but it is a fact the papacy
declared these priory knights
these knights templar
of limitless power
by the 1300s the templars
had grown too powerful
too threatening
so the vatican
issued secret orders
to be opened simultaneously
all across europe
the pope had declared the
knights templar satan worshipers
and said god had charged him with
cleansing the earth of these heretics
the plan went off like clockwork
the templars
were all but exterminated
the date was october 13th 1307
a friday
friday the 13th
the pope sent troops
to claim the priorys treasure
but they found nothing
the few surviving
knights of the priory had vanished
and the search for their
sacred artifact began again
what artifact ive never
heard about any of this
yes you have
almost everyone on earth has
you just know it as the holy grail
please saunière thought he knew
the location of the holy grail
maybe more than that
this cross and the flower
this could be very old but look
this metal here underneath is much
newer and theres a modern id stamp
haxo 24
and these dots
these dots are read by a laser
this is more than a pendant
this is a key your grandfather left you
he left us professor
and vingtquatre haxo
its not an id stamp
its a street address
this is jacques saunière
please leave a message
after the tone
please monsieur saunière
pick up the phone
this is sandrine bieil
i have called the list
i fear the other guardians are dead
the lie has been told
the floor panel has been broken
please monsieur pick up the phone
i beg you
job 38 verse 11
do you know it sister
job 3811
hitherto shalt thou come
but no further
but no further
do you mock me
where is the keystone
i do not know
no
you are a sister of the church
and yet you serve them
the priory
jesus had but one true message
that
come you saints of god
hasten angels of the lord
to receive her soul
and bring her to the sight
of the almighty
in the name of the father
the son and the holy spirit
welcome bishop
may christ be with you
and also with you
its been too long manuel
i saw your press conference
very priestly
vultures
but you need a good cover
to fly into italy these days
so how are things in rome
we serve at his pleasure
today is today
but there are many tomorrows
vatican cellars
seventysix a year of independence
how fitting
i thought youd like it
ill fetch the others
welcome bishop
this council is convened
our words shall never
pass these walls
what business say you
as you know my request for funds
yes 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds
a tad more than petty cash
wouldnt you say bishop
the endeavor is complex
freedom has a high cost
and of course you will deliver us
how fortunate we are
i only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men
how humble
our savior bishop aringarosa
were we to grant your request
when would
this mission commence
actually tonight
what
it has begun
we have not agreed
how dare you presume to
i do not presume i act
the vaticans unwillingness
to support us
is both impious and cowardly
blood is being spilled because true
christian values lie in ruins no more
this council has forgotten
its very purpose
tonight
the grail will be destroyed
the priorys few remaining members
will be silenced
i was contacted by a man
who calls himself only the teacher
he knows a great deal
about this council
and about the priory
two prostitutes identified
langdon and neveu
getting into a taxi
in the bois de boulogne
because of your expertise
im sorry
about the priory
do you think thats why
saunière sought you out
i can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it
actually i didnt think
he liked me very much
once made a joke at my expense
got a big laugh out of it
what was it
how may i help you
the door to the right please
that was quite a performance
the little shit should know better
than to play politics with me
i know i got in front of you
old friend
i did what i thought was best
so
now what
now we wait for the teachers call
good evening i am andré vernet
the night manager
i take it this is your first visit
to our establishment
yes
understood
keys are often passed on
and firsttime users
are sometimes
uncertain of protocol
keys are essentially
numbered swiss accounts
often willed through generations
is it yours mademoiselle
the shortest safetydepositbox
lease is 50 years
and whats your longest account
quite a bit longer
technologies change
keys are updated
but our accounts date back
to the beginning of banking itself
once the computer
confirms your key
enter your account number
and your box is retrieved
the room is yours
as long as you like
what if i lost track
of my account number
how might i recover it
im afraid each key is paired
with a 10digit number
known only to the account bearer
i hope you manage to remember it
a single wrong entry
disables the system
ten
ten
your grandfathers
fibonacci sequence
scrambled unscrambled
unscrambled
its your key
funny i dont even like history
ive never seen much good come
from looking to the past
moment of truth
my god i dont believe this
a rose
the rose was a symbol
for the holy grail
forgive the intrusion
im afraid the police arrived
more quickly than i anticipated
you must follow me please
for your own safety
you knew they were coming
my guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived
yours is one of our oldest
and highestlevel accounts
it includes a safepassage clause
safe passage
if you would step inside please
time is of the essence
in there
hey is there a problem
good evening sir police
i just drive from here to zurich
not french english
english
yes
we are looking for two criminals
you came to the right place
theyre all criminals here
would you mind opening the hold
please you think they trust us
the wages i get paid
you dont have keys
to your own truck
its armored
keys get sent to the destination
you mind im on a schedule here
and do all the drivers wear a rolex
what
this piece of shit
forty euros in barbès
yours for 35
no no no
thirty
no its okay its okay
come on 30 eh
i said no
move along
now we wait
the teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money
you have put tremendous faith
in this teacher of yours
yes i have and i have given him
an angel to do his will
for surely there is no better
soldier for god than my silas
i firmly resolve with the help of
thy grace to confess my sins
to do penance
and to amend my life
amen
i chastise my body
the holy grail
a magic cup
the source of gods power on earth
its nonsense
you dont believe in god
no
i dont believe in some magic
from the sky
just people
sometimes that they can be kind
and thats enough
well i think it has to be
i think its all we have
are you a godfearing man
professor
i was raised a catholic
well thats not really an answer
professor are you okay
go ahead open it
go on
a cryptex
they are used to keep secrets
its da vincis design
you write the information
on a papyrus scroll
which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar
if you force it open the vial breaks
vinegar dissolves papyrus
and your secret is lost forever
the only way
to access the information
is to spell out the password
with these five dials
each with 26 letters
thats 12 million possibilities
ive never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex
saunière made one for me once
my grandfather gave me a wagon
this clearly is not the holy grail
come on
please youre not all right
may i try something
i dont know why it works
my mother used to do it
when i was scared i think
you think
yes
feeling better sophie
my parents died in a car crash
with my brother
i was 4
im sorry
it was many years ago
better
yeah
okay
twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box
and now its you two murderers
bring it to me
i dont know what
youre talking about
all right okay
right now
step back
no one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree
turn around
turn around
you too mademoiselle
sophie
get in the truck
ill drive hurry
better
always if i got too nervous
i had to put my head out
of the window not to be sick
saunière used to say
i was like a dog
a cute dog you know a little dog
what happened between you
and your grandfather sophie
ive jammed my shoulder
ive been shot at im bleeding
i need to know
you say he raised you
but you two dont talk anymore
you call him by his last name
you say you hate history
nobody hates history
they hate their own histories
so now youre a psychologist too
what if saunière had started
to groom you for the priory
what do you mean groom me
your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child
say saunière was hoping one day
you would join him in the priory
still years later
when he imagines
the grail is in danger
he reaches out to you
so you are saying all this is real
the priory the holy grail
weve been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real
real enough to kill for
who
im out of my field here
i do know a grail historian
absolutely obsessed with priory myth
an englishman
lives here in france
do you trust this man
i hope you can
vernet andré
it seems youre not a driver at all
apparently you lost your tongue
along with your truck
aiding and abetting
two murder suspects
that carries jail time
speak to my lawyer
all this confusion violence
vanishing property
it might get around that your bank is
less than ideal dont you think
you think youre in pain now
andré vernet
my cause is worth your life
understand
what do you want
your truck carries a homing device
activate it
please wait
ill see if hes available
its on the wrong side
leigh likes all things to be english
including his cars
robert do i owe you money
leigh my friend
care to open up
for an old colleague
of course
thank you
but first a test of honor
three questions
fire away
your first
shall i serve coffee or tea
tea of course
excellent
second milk or lemon
milk
that would depend on the tea
correct
and now the third
and most grave of inquiries
in which year did a harvard sculler
outrow an oxford man at henley
surely such a travesty
has never occurred
your heart is true
you may pass
welcome to château villette
leigh teabing has spent
his entire life
studying the grail
that thing is one hot tamale
sorry
the cryptex its a hot coal
a hot potato
so you want to keep our chest
close to our cards yes
very close
the trucks signal is coming online
its about time
locked on and tracking sir
very good tell collet not to move in
until i get there
attention all of collets units
to château villette
the suspects neveu and langdon
are likely at that location
aringarosa
i still dont know why
he put you into this
and im sorry
but
im also very glad
you are requested
to make yourself at home
robert
and you travel with a maiden
it seems
sir leigh teabing
may i present miss sophie neveu
sophie sir leigh teabing
its an honor to welcome you
even though its late
thank you for having us
i realize its quite late
so late mademoiselle
its almost early
what a lovely smile you have
earl grey
lemon
correct
château villette yes
no
oh you must
remy is from lyons
but nevertheless
he is fantastic with sauces
thank you
no i cant
a dramatic latenight arrival
mention of life and death
what can an old cripple
do for you robert
we wanna talk about
the priory of sion
the keepers
the secret war
sorry for all the mystery
leigh im into something here
that i cannot understand
you
really
not without your help
playing to my vanity robert
you should be ashamed
not if it works
there are always four
the grand master
and the three sénéchaux
make up the primary
guardians of the grail
thank you remy
thatll be all for now
the priorys members
span our very globe itself
philippe de chérisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967
and that is what
they want you to believe
the priory is charged
with a single task
to protect the greatest secret
in modern history
the source of gods power
on earth
no thats a common
misunderstanding
the priory protects the source
of the churchs power on earth
the holy grail
i dont understand
what power some magic dishes
robert has he been telling you
that the holy grail is a cup
to understand the holy grail
my dear
you must first understand
the holy bible
the good book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven
the bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man
the pagan emperor constantine
i thought constantine
was a christian
oh hardly no
he was a lifelong pagan
who was baptized
on his deathbed
constantine was romes
supreme holy man
from time immemorial
his people had worshiped a balance
between natures male deities
and the goddess
or sacred feminine
but a growing religious turmoil
was gripping rome
three centuries earlier
a young jew named jesus
had come along
preaching love and a single god
centuries after his crucifixion
christs followers
had grown exponentially
and had started a religious war
against the pagans
or did the pagans commence war
against the christians
leigh we cant be sure who began
the atrocities in that period
we can at least agree that the
conflict grew to such proportions
that it threatened
to tear rome in two
so constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan
but he was also a pragmatist
and in 325 anno domini
he decided to unify rome under
a single religion christianity
christianity was on the rise
he didnt want his empire torn apart
and to strengthen this new
christian tradition
constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering
known as the council of nicaea
and at this council
the many sects of christianity
debated and voted on well
everything from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels
to the date for easter
to the administering
of the sacraments and of course
the immortality of jesus
i dont follow
well ma chère
until that moment in history
jesus was viewed by many of his
followers as a mighty prophet
as a great and powerful man
but a man nevertheless
a mortal man
some christians held
that jesus was mortal
some christians believed
he was divine
not the son of god
not even his nephew twice removed
hold on youre saying
jesus divinity came from a vote
well remember in those days
gods were everywhere
by infusing jesus the man
with the divine magic
by making him capable
of earthly miracles
as well as his own resurrection
constantine turned him into a god
but within the human world
and he basically knocked the more
distant gods out of the game
constantine did not create
jesus divinity
he simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea
semantics
no its not semantics
youre interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions
fact for many christians jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next
for some christians
his divinity was enhanced
absurd there was a formal
announcement of his promotion
they couldnt even agree
on the nicene creed
excuse me
who is god who is man
how many have been murdered
over this question
as long as there has been
a one true god
there has been killing
in his name
now let me show you the grail
this used to be the ballroom
i have little occasion to dance
these days
i trust you recognize
the last supper
the great fresco by
leonardo da vinci
now my dear
if you would close your eyes
oh leigh save us the parlor tricks
you asked for my help i recall
allow an old man his indulgences
now mademoiselle
where is jesus sitting
in the middle
good
he and his disciples
are breaking bread
and what drink
wine they drank wine
splendid and one final question
how many wineglasses
are there on the table
one the holy grail
open your eyes
no single cup
no chalice
well thats a bit strange isnt it
considering both the bible
and standard grail legend
celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the holy grail
now robert
you could be of help to us
if youd be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman please
no balloon animals
i can make a great duck
this is the original icon for male
its a rudimentary phallus
quite to the point
yes indeed
this is known as the blade
it represents aggression
and manhood
its a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms
yes the more penises you have the
higher your rank boys will be boys
now as you would imagine the
female symbol is its exact opposite
this is called the chalice
and the chalice resembles a cup
or vessel or more importantly
the shape of a womans womb
no the grail has never been a cup
it is quite literally this ancient
symbol of womanhood
and in this case a woman who
carried a secret so powerful
that if revealed it would devastate
the very foundations of christianity
wait please
youre saying the holy grail
is a person a woman
and it turns out she makes
an appearance right there
but they are all men
are they
what about that figure
on the right hand of our lord
seated in the place of honor
flowing red hair
folded feminine hands
hint of a bosom no
its called scotoma
the mind sees what it chooses to see
who is she
my dear thats mary magdalene
the prostitute
she was no such thing
smeared by the church
in 591 anno domini poor dear
mary magdalene was jesus wife
this is an old wives tale
the original one in fact
theres virtually no empirical proof
he knows as well as i do
theres much evidence to support it
theories there are theories
notice how jesus and mary
are clothed
mirror images of each other
the mind sees
what it chooses to see
and venturing into the even more
bizarre notice how jesus and mary
appear to be joined at the hip and
are leaning away from each other
as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them
leonardo gives us the chalice
yes oh and robert
notice what happens
when these two figures
change position
just because da vinci painted it
doesnt make it true
no but history
she does make it true
now listen to this its from
the gospel according to philip
philip
yes it was rejected
at the council of nicaea
along with any other gospels
that made
jesus appear human
and not divine
and the companion of the savior
is mary magdalene
christ loved her more
than all the disciples
and used to kiss her on the
but this says nothing of marriage
well actually
robert
actually in those days the word
companion literally meant spouse
and this is from the gospel
of mary magdalene herself
she wrote a gospel
she may have
robert will you fight fair
she may have
and peter said
did he prefer her to us
and levi answered
peter i see you contending
against a woman like an adversary
if the savior made her worthy
who are you indeed to reject her
yes and then my dear jesus
goes on to tell mary magdalene
that its up to her
to continue his church
mary magdalene not peter
the church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman
few realize that mary was descended
from kings just as her husband was
now my dear the word
in french for holy grail
from the middle english
sangreal
of the original arthurian legend
now as two words
can you translate for our friend
sang real it means royal blood
when the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of christ
it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried jesus royal bloodline
but how could christ
have a bloodline unless
mary was pregnant
at the time of the crucifixion
for her own safety and for that
of christs unborn child
she fled the holy land
and came to france
and here it is said
she gave birth to a daughter sarah
they know the childs name
a little girl
yes
if that were true
its adding insult to injury
why
the pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female
people found god through sex
in paganism women were worshiped
as a route to heaven
but the modern church
has a monopoly on that
in salvation through jesus christ
and he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world
women then are a huge threat
to the church
the catholic inquisition
soon publishes
what may be the most
bloodsoaked book in human history
the malleus maleficarum
the witches hammer
it instructed the clergy on how
to locate torture and kill
all freethinking women
in three centuries of witch hunts
50000 women are captured
burned alive at the stake
oh at least that
some say millions
imagine then robert
that christs throne
might live on in a female child
you asked what would
be worth killing for
witness the greatest coverup
in human history
this is the secret
that the priory of sion
has defended
for over 20 centuries
they are the guardians
of the royal bloodline
the keepers of the proof
of our true past
they are the protectors of the living
descendants of jesus christ
and mary magdalene
sir leigh
sometimes i wonder
who is serving whom
his sauces are not that fantastic
yes can i help you
yes theyre on the news now
living descendants is it possible
its not impossible
you have not been honest with me
your pictures are on the television
you are wanted for four murders
thats why vernet said
killing spree
you come into my home
playing on my passions for the grail
thats why he needed you
you will leave my house
leigh listen
no im calling the police
jacques saunière
was her grandfather
youre the obsessive priory scholar
you still keep lists
of who might be in the priory
ill bet jacques saunière
was on one of those lists
he was on your list of who could
be grand master wasnt he
what
ill bet he was right at the top
consider four men murdered
the same number as the guardians
what if the priory was compromised
the other sénéchaux dead
what if you yourself were dying
a grand master
youd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust
someone outside the society
maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished
robert your ruse is pathetic
not really
no thats impossible
can that really
is it the keystone
ill even show it to you leigh
will you just tell us
what the hell its for
fache says to wait so i wait
whats fache thinking
the truck is here theyre inside
yes
as the legend foretold
it hides beneath the rose
oh my
leigh
leigh
please
im sorry yes of course
inside the keystone
therell be a map
a map that will lead us
to the holy grail
to be trained by
the grand master himself
did he pass down the fleurdelis
is that how you found this
and he must have sung you
the riddle songs
i know some of them
can you keep secrets
can you know a thing
and never say it again
and codes
i imagine they lie down
for you like lovers
a sénéchal a guardian of the grail
right here in my own home
tell him please
i dont know any of this
leigh its not that simple
she doesnt rem
robert
do not move woman
cripple
put the box on the table
what this trifle
well perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement
put the keystone on the table
you will not succeed
only the worthy
can unlock the stone
rip the gate down
well well my dear
sit down
are you okay
yeah yeah
are you
yeah
yes well make yourself useful
you french fool
get something
to restrain this monster
above the joint
fortunately
a dragon most easy to slay
hes wearing a cilice
a what
well look
inflicts pain so he can suffer
as christ suffered
not so common these days
opus dei
remy take care of this
fache is opus dei
the policeman whos chasing us
he wears the cross in the world
robert
well i must say
you two are anything but dull
leigh
you want whats in this box
we need a way out of here
well actually
i do have a plane
robert where do we go
come along
in here come in
over here
get the door hurry
over here over here sophie
watch out
be careful
come rem
shit
easy
jesus
apropos
i cant imagine
what your complaint is
id be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods
put that away we might need him
better
opus dei
what is it
a conservative catholic sect
opus dei is a prelature
to the vatican
youre saying the vatican
is killing people for this box
no no no not the vatican
and not opus dei
but we are in the middle of a war
and one that has been
going on forever
on the one side stands the priory
and on the other
an ancient group of despots
with members hidden
in highranking positions
throughout the church
and this council of shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline
and that throughout history
they seek out and kill
the living descendants
of jesus christ
thats insane
is it
how many atrocities and scandals
has the catholic church
rationalized in its time
and what happens
if some persuasive scientific
evidence emerges that shows
that the churchs version of christ
is inaccurate
what if the world discovers
that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie
the vatican faces a crisis of faith
unprecedented
ive got a signal now sir
its ringing
roger look im so sorry ive got
tired of the weather here in france
and could you make
the plane ready for
zurich
yes no we love zurich
what the hell do you mean
you lost them collet
youre the one who lost them
you control every step of this investigation
you dont let anybody breathe
youre acting like
you lost your mind
what is it with these two birds
interpol just registered a new
flight plan from le bourget
stay out of my way on this collet
did you kill jacques saunière
i am the messenger of god
did you kill my grandfather
i am the messenger
each breath you take is a sin
no shadow will be safe again
for you will be hunted by angels
you believe in god
your god doesnt
forgive murderers
he burns them
sophie
the teacher will be pleased
what will you do
once you have the grail
destroy it
the documents and the
sarcophagus of course
and the heir
will you exercise the final edict
spill his blood
there will be no need
once the sarcophagus is destroyed
dna testing will be impossible
there is no way to prove
a living bloodline
but if you had to
would you do as councils
have done before us
christ
christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity
so too may be the fate of his seed
robert
when we land you must go
straight to your embassy
is that so
dont you see it
they never wanted you
maybe even fache didnt
its all about this
idiotic little box
thats not too flattering
crazy old man
why leave me with this
i should just throw it away
he trusted you sophie
a guardian of the holy grail
it sounds so stupid
its quite an honor
if you think about it
and take it seriously
he took it seriously enough
to get himself killed
not him you
he was the only family i knew
and maybe i didnt know him at all
im his marionette robert
like a girl again
just with no gift at the end
but youve done enough
i dont know why saunière
picked me to help you sophie
but i wont leave you alone
in all this
two marionettes then
maybe this is why he chose you
because you will stay
i need the flight plan
ten minutes
i asked you to get it for me
im on break
come back in 10 minutes
my nose my nose
the flight plan please
you asshole
its not cross
spear
what happened to her
no one knows
mary magdalene lived out
her days in hiding
and the zealots pursued her still
even in death trying to destroy
proof of her existence
but she always had her knights
brave men sworn to defend her
you see to worship
before her sarcophagus
to kneel before the bones
of mary magdalene
was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power
who were oppressed
ultimately the priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline
until most believed
her sarcophagus
the holy grail
was finally lost in time
what are you doing
at the chateau you said
it hides beneath the rose
no no no do be careful
in latin sub rosa
literal translation
beneath the rose
we need a mirror
backwards in the style
of leonardo himself
thank you
in london lies a knight
a pope interred
his labors fruit
a holy wrath incurred
you seek the orb
that ought be on his tomb
it speaks of rosy flesh
and seeded womb
in london lies a knight
a pope interred
a knight whose funeral
was presided over by the pope
of course the priory knights
were not just any knights
templars
and theres just one place to bury
a templar knight in london
temple church
temple church
if youll excuse me my dear
roger and i must discuss
a change in flight plan
leigh
harboring and transporting
fugitives
you are already implicated enough
you and i robert
have observed history
time has been our glass
we are in history now living it
making it
implicated
i am on a grail quest
forgive me robert
but you two may well
have given this old man
the greatest night of his life
thank you
hes going to want more money
i suppose this is a new technique
for investigations
ive lost them
they flew to switzerland
no extradition
the controller filed charges
ari was on dispatch he called me
whats going on bezu
you know that i am opus dei
yes
a bishop of my order called me
he said a killer
came to him in confession
his name was robert langdon
he said i couldnt imagine
the evil in this mans heart
that he would keep killing
he said i had to stop him
the bishop broke his vows
to tell me this
he charged me
to stop robert langdon
tell me collet who have i failed
the bishop
god himself
theyve changed their flight plan
to london
go on fache
ill take care of the controller
maybe he needs a few extra euros
just tell me next time
i have them tower relay hawker
to land and hold on tarmac
secure the area
wider
armed police
you two round the back
armed police
put your hands in the air
three men up
ready
put your hands in the air do it now
im afraid thats
easier said than done in my case
oh good morning
did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me
sir the french police say
youre transporting fugitives
and you may have
a hostage onboard
im to take you all into custody
sadly i have an important medical
appointment which i cant miss
ill fetch the car sir
this is serious sir the french police
are on their way stop
inspector i cant afford the time
to indulge your games
im late and im leaving
if its so important
for you to stop us
then youre just going
to have to shoot us
you can start with him
search the plane
all right
i could run them over
bad tip
let him go
the french cannot be trusted
everyone comfy
biscuits
they didnt notice anything
well people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes dont you find
do you have the bonds bishop
yes i do teacher
i have chosen an opus dei
residence for the exchange
i am honored
by the time you get to london
i will have the grail
i take it the news is good then
i fly to london
the teacher is waiting for me there
he has chosen a house of opus dei
to make the exchange
mere currency
for the location of the grail
imagine it
remember if we are discovered by
the vatican we are excommunicated
so should anything go wrong
yes i know i know
this council does not exist
as it never has
old friend heaven protect you
keep an eye out for the police
i must say robert
im quite impressed
by the way you withstood
my little aeroplane
did he never tell you
when he was a boy
young robert fell into a well
how old were you
seven
treading water all night long
screaming his lungs out
to the echoes screaming back
when they found him
he was nearly catatonic
help
it was a long time ago
oh now now robert
you above all people shouldnt be one
to dismiss the influence of the past
temple church
i always forget its right here
built 1185 and modern london
just sprang up right around it
tell me why has the priory kept the
grail location secret all these years
i dont know
some say the priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself
which is especially odd
since legend suggests he may not
know his own true identity
hello
why do they make them so scary
oh its cold
in london lies a knight
a pope interred
so which tomb has an orb
those knights
with their legs crossed
means theyd been
to the holy land
two wear tunics over their armor
and two have fulllength robes
two are grasping swords
and one two are praying
this one has his arms at his sides
oh and this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely
i dont see any orb
that ought be on a tomb
ought be on his tomb
are we looking for a missing orb
maybe
these arent tombs
what yes of course they are
no
theyre effigies
what
not tombs theres no bodies here
this place is wrong
can we go now we should go
sophie no
where is the keystone
do not test me
let her go
dont hurt her
give me the keystone give it to me
here here here it is here it is
just let her go and you and i can
well come to some agreement
remy
remy no no no no put it away
put it away theyre too close
together you dont have a clear shot
yes i do
what do you think youre doing
thank you professor for a moment
this was getting complicated
oh this is absurd
oh for gods sake man
that was satisfying
im glad this bullshit is over
throw teabing in the trunk
what
here you okay
sorry
i dont think hes following
they wont kill leigh
until they find the grail
so we have to find it before they do
i have to get to a library fast
lieutenant

wasted space of so large a trunk
lets see if he complains so now
are you the teacher
i am
superbly done
youve been of great service
the cryptex has yet to be opened
i can still serve
youve done enough
we cannot let ego
deter us from our goal
i understand

and you will be rewarded
i will dispose of the old man
bless you silas
teacher

excuse me may i sit next to you
yeah sure
thank you
thats great
didnt say you had a boyfriend
thanks
lets see if we can access
the database on this
in london lies a knight
a pope interred
compounding keywords
knight pope grail
your precious treasure was
almost lost and with it my fortune
can you believe how well i did
i even convinced the monk
i should be in theater
a toast to our success teacher
the end of the journey is near
your identity shall go
with me to the grave
theres your problem mate
its your basic linguistic coincidence
see keywords keep coming up
with the writings
of some bloke named
alexander pope
a pope
your grandfather was a genius
come on
emergency
which service do you require
i know the location of two murderers
wanted by french police
weve just had a 999 call
triangulation leads back
to docklands
caller was male
claimed your two murderers
are hiding at an opus dei house
the knight were looking for
is sir isaac newton
his lifes work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the church
gravity for god sakes
and if you choose to believe
he was also a grand master
of the priory as well
but if he offended
the catholic church
the pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral
well thats where i got it wrong
in london lies a knight
a pope interred
sir isaac newtons funeral
was presided over
by his good friend
his colleague alexander pope
a pope his first initial
how did i miss that
here
yes isaac newtons tomb
an orb
yes which one its not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing
an orb with rosy flesh
and seeded womb
solar system the planets
constellations signs of the zodiac
see our moon is missing
the moons of saturn and jupiter
theyre not here
eyes of the cherubs themselves
robert these tracks
look at the cane marks in the dust
teabing was here
he was alone
when the two of you
arrived at my home as you did
others might call it gods will
i believed that if i had the cryptex
i could solve the riddle alone
but i was unworthy
but you
you have a reason to be here
youre the last remaining
guardian of the grail
your grandfather
and the other sénéchaux
would not have lied
with dying breath
unless they knew
their secret was preserved
how could you know
saunières last words
leigh
grail quests require sacrifice
you are a murderer
no no robert tell her
when history is written
murderers are heroes
you selfrighteous bastard
we need to just walk away
no dont dont
walk away
ill do what i have to now
anything
do you understand
so now
cant we all be friends again
this way
im going to put this gun down
i only want you both to listen
im listening now
for 2000 years
the church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind
crushed passion and idea alike
all in the name of their walking god
proof of jesus mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering
drive this church of lies
to its knees
armed police
drop your weapon
stop silas
we are betrayed my son
the living heir must be revealed
jesus must be shown
for what he was
not miraculous simply man
im sorry
armed police
drop your weapon drop it drop it
put it down now put it down
i am a ghost
the dark con can be exposed
mankind can finally be set free
and we can do it robert
the three of us
how is silas
is he is he alive
the monk
bishop how would you know
this killers name
get me out of here fache
wait
langdon never came to you
in confession did he
one of your followers called you
about the crimescene photos
i cannot be implicated here there are
still important works to be done
you used me
god uses us all
help me fache
take him
did you get his cell phone
yes sir
im going to need a trace
your silas is dead
the priorys sacred charge
was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium
the millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden
the priory failed
in their sacred charge
so what choice did i have
i sought out the enemy
i persuaded them the council
of shadows that i was an ally
i even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me
rector i made them call me
teacher
why dont you and i
no
robert no words on your knees
do it
no i mean it down
not you no my dear you
youre my miracle sophie
youre the guardian of the grail
all the oppression of the poor
and the powerless
of those of different skin
of women
you can put an end to all that
you must explode the truth
onto the world
its your duty
you know the answer to this riddle
open the cryptex
and ill put down the gun
i have no idea how
i dont know the code
and even if i did i wouldnt tell you
like your grandfather then
willing to die for your secret
but by the way youve been
looking at your hero
i wonder would you
let him die for you
open it sophie to save his life
leigh you cant just
open the cryptex
i dont know how
open it or he dies
i swear i dont know
do it do it
stop it
i dont know
stop it
she cant do it leigh
but give me a moment
robert
what are you doing
please
im sorry
no
no robert
no
no
oh the map its ruined
the map is ruined
the grail
its lost
the grail is gone
only the worthy
find the grail leigh
you taught me that
armed police
drop it drop your weapon
put the gun down
that one the old man
youre under arrest
you do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defense
if you do not mention
when questioned
something which you
later rely on in court
anything you do say
will be given in evidence
ill have some questions for you
big crowd out there now
thank you for your statements
you are free to go of course
im sorry you thought
he was your friend no
it wasnt only us was it
he used you too
leave us please
i should have been smarter
i acted on faith i suppose
im sorry
how many
your grandfather the other three
maybe more
the monk was given to teabing
as a gift it seems
to do as he asked
teabing killed the servant himself
you know
remy
yes
by poison
how much of it
have you been able to figure out
some not enough for it
to make sense
it wont ever make sense
im sorry
he forgot everything weve learned
everything we teach
its why we study history
so well stop killing each other
robert robert robert
how could you do it
how could you robert
to destroy our hope of freedom
to deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the magdalene
how could you
you couldnt you solved it
you took the scroll out
before it broke
you solved it oh youll find it robert
youll find it you know what to do
youll find the grail
youll kneel before her
and youll set her free
upon the world
that man there
hes got the map to the holy grail
there was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one
the orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired newtons lifes work
work that incurred the wrath
of the church until his dying day
a p p l e
apple
the holy grail neath
ancient roslin waits
the blade and chalice
guarding oer her gates
adorned in masters
loving art she lies
she rests at last
beneath the starry skies
i think i know where shes gone
i think the grail has gone home
built by the templars themselves
named for the original rose line
rosslyn chapel
so this is it
the gift at the end
the holy grail neath
ancient roslin waits
you never told me the joke
saunière made of you
what was it
he called me a flatfoot
a beat cop of history
oh a dumb policeman
who just does his job
day after day of history
you know his father was one
a policeman
saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known
we are who we protect i think
what we stand up for
jewish
christian egyptian
masonic pagan
templar crosses
pyramids
i think ive been here before
sophie
a very long time ago
come along sophie
sophie
over here
the blade and chalice
guarding oer her gates
pagan symbols for
male and female
fused as one
as the pagans would have wanted
were about to close im afraid
were just gonna be a moment
robert
ive never seen that before
the style is
its unmistakable
these could have been painted by
leonardo da vinci
adorned in masters
loving art she lies
she rests at last
beneath the starry skies
the fleurdelis
she was here
her sarcophagus
mary magdalene
the holy grail herself
she was here
with modern dna testing
those bones
could have shown definitive proof
of a bloodline
where did she go
did the church finally get her
this is incredible look at this
look at this these records
go back thousands of years
they date back
to the death of christ
good god could these
really be the grail documents
what did he want from us
to find her sarcophagus
how was i ever supposed
to figure all this out
when you and your
grandfather fought
was it something about your past
how could you know that
about how your parents died
sophie
it was during primary school
i was in his library
doing research
i was trying to find out
about my family
sophie where are you princess
i wanted to know about them
but i couldnt find any records
not of their death
not of the accident
id asked him for as long
as i could remember
but he would never tell me
i told you no
but why cant i
he stood over me
and he wouldnt let me leave
theyre dead dead and buried
never look for them sophie
promise me
swear it
swear it to me
i kept my promise
the next week he sent me
to boarding school
one weekend
i came home unexpectedly
and what i saw
my grandfather doing
some ritual
i was so frightened
we hardly ever spoke again
do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the accident
before your parents were killed
yeah no i dont know
why
because i dont think
he was your grandfather
these are my parents
my brother
and this is you isnt it
the paper says
the entire family was killed
the mother the father the boy 6
and the girl 4
but your name was never saunière
its saintclair
its one of the oldest families
in france
its from a line of the
merovingian kings
royal blood
i was so wrong
saunière didnt want you to help guard
the secret of the holy grail
sophie
you are the secret
you survived the accident
if it even was an accident
the priory found out
somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive
they hid you with the
grand master himself
who raised you as his own
according to all of this
princess sophie
you are the heir
the end of the bloodline
you are the last living descendent
of jesus christ
what is this
sophie
who are you
there have been many names
the keepers
guardians
the priory of sion
but to you sophie we are friends
of the man who raised you
jacques saunière
he would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much
and that the priory are here
to protect you now
as they have always
protected our family
i gave you up once
knowing i might
never see you again
im your grandmother sophie
i have prayed for this moment
for a very long time
welcome home child
hey
no more strings
his last breath to keep me safe
she has some things
she wants to tell me
about my family
what will you do
the legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself
they just got the pronoun wrong
she said when saunière died
he took the location
of marys sarcophagus with him
so theres no way to empirically prove
that i am related to her
what would you do robert
okay maybe there is no proof
maybe the grail is lost forever
but sophie the only thing that
matters is what you believe
history shows us
jesus was an extraordinary man
a human inspiration thats it
thats all the evidence
has ever proved
but
when i was a boy
when i was down in that well
teabing told you about
i thought i was going to die
sophie
what i did
i prayed
i prayed to jesus to keep me alive
so i could see my parents again
so i could go to school again
so i could play with my dog
sometimes i wonder
if i wasnt alone down there
why does it have to be
human or divine
maybe human is divine
why couldnt jesus
have been a father
and still been capable
of all those miracles
like turning water into wine
well who knows
his blood is your blood
maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again
maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands
and maybe youre
a knight on a grail quest
well heres the question
a living descendent
of jesus christ
would she destroy faith
or would she renew it
so again i say what matters
is what you believe
thank you
for bringing me here
for letting him choose you
sir robert
you take care
yes
hey
nope
maybe ill do better with the wine
godspeed
