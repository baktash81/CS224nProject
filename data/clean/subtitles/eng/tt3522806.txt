youre a hard man to find
speaking portuguese
you even have the accent right
i do say so
the principal i represent
has an offer for you
he would like three men killed
each death must look like an accident
your specialty i believe
seems that reports of your demise
have been greatly exaggerated
my principal could make that known
to certain interested parties
which means that your new life here
would end rather quickly
or you can do the job
and go back to being dead
whats your pleasure
senor otto santos
let me make a call
what are you doing

to fuck with the dead
grunts

he was supposed to get me
and i escaped to this island
it wasnt meant to be real

and attacked me
crain wanted me to look like a victim

so we meet what next
i use the cell and call
the preprogrammed number
let it ring once
after that i dont know
my new girl gets kidnapped is what
what
the thought didnt cross your mind
okay so you fall for me

why
well to force me to do something
i dont want to do
what is it that you do
ill make the call not you
i choose when they come
then ill take crain out
no im not going to
help you kill anyone
do you really believe that crain
lets the people he blackmails
into helping him live
ive spent my whole life
setting people up to die
i can set you up to live
sighs
my father was a doctor
of eastern medicine
he was a healer
bishop used to study with him
to learn how to heal
a man like him
i thought so too
but my father understood
that those who have been hurt the most
often have the greatest ability to heal
narrator
eighteen months ago
special military operative gina thornton
left the war zone in afghanistan
to offer humanitarian
assistance in cambodia
after my last deployment
i just needed a change
too many innocent people
getting caught in the line of fire
rules of engagement
made it impossible to prevent
children laughing
and then you know
when i came to phnom penh i uh
i dont know it just felt right here
and um i felt like i can maybe
do something good with my life
i cant afford any surprises
need to know what crain has on you
i run a shelter for victims
of human trafficking in cambodia
theres always been an issue or two
but ive managed to handle it
a few weeks ago
one of my staff members was kidnapped
two days later she was
thrown off a truck at my front door
beaten died within an hour
crain sent this asshole jeremy
who said it was just a taste
of what hed do
to everyone at the shelter
including the children
they are my weakness
all the leverage crain needed
so you see i didnt have a choice
i had to do what crain wanted me to
what are you doing
hold my hand
its for crains people
theyre watching
where
two men in a zodiac
out in the ocean
thai folk music playing
there you are
come on you two
youre gonna miss the best part
give me your hands
indistinct conversations
hold this please
we can just get a drink and
no you will not
you will stay right there
gina mei

sighs

and place three dots
on each others foreheads for good luck

both laughing

chuckles
gina hey
i um just wanted to
thank you for everything

and i wanted to apologize for
getting you into this mess
those kids are everything to me
if they get trafficked or
or killed
i couldnt bear it
i understand
i was an orphan too
i was sold to an east end gangster who
specialized in training child soldiers
crain was there too
what happened
i escaped he didnt
no doubt they blamed him
took it out in blood
so now he blames you
yeah this is his payback
oh god im so sorry
its not your fault
what are we gonna do
sighs
i worked it out
supply boat from the back side
of the island out of view
by tomorrow night
youll be out of danger
your kids too
its all arranged
what about crain
im not doing his three kills
once youre safe
theres only going to be one him

follow me
dog barking
sit down
beeps

crain id listen to her
if i were you arthur
no need for guards or guns
when the man you wants
sitting on a pound of semtex
how did you find me riah
what no hello
nice to see you after all these years
but then you always were
one for getting down to business
how did i find you
you should know better
than anyone arthur
theres no privacy anymore
not with wonderful things like
facial recognition
and satellite tracking
im going to give you something
i never give anyone
chance to walk away
give me the girl and walk away
i see youve developed
a sense of humor over the years
but if its all the same no
i need you youre the best
open it
i need you to eliminate three people
and this is the first
his name is krill
massmurderer and warlord
hes also the highestprofile
arms dealer in africa
hes imprisoned
on penjara kaedah in malaysia
his imprisonment
is what keeps him secure
its impossible for his enemies
to get to him
bishop and this
its important that you
swallow it only after the kill
or the fuel cell will degrade
and well never find you
wheres gina
do the three kills arthur
get the girl back
even if you dont love her
you at least owe her no
i mean shes in this shit
because of you
how do i know youll keep her alive
finish your kill get a video call
after the last one youll receive
instructions where to find her
and your words good is it
good heavens absolutely not
but i do have a very keen
sense of selfpreservation
i know that cheating you
will only make me your target
and since that concludes
our business for the moment
i wish you bonne chance
lets get moving sweetheart come on
come on lets go
indistinct conversations
crain
the prison is 70 miles out to sea
set atop cliffs
more than 100 meters high
and surrounded by sharkinfested waters
so basically impossible to get in
and nobody has ever gotten out
it will be even harder to get your man
hes surrounded at all times
by his team of loyal soldiers
getting him alone
will be your main challenge
employee
shark repellent yes sir
thank you

prisoners cheering
rat squeaks
who the hell is that
krill
he was an executioner for people like
charles taylor and the sudanese militia

the hearts of his victims

but he has his bodyguards
constantly protecting him

adrian cook

crain in the heart of downtown sydney
atop a 58story highrise
is the penthouse suite
owned by adrian cook
the mining and minerals billionaire
few people know that he originally
made his fortune in human trafficking
specializing in underage sex workers
he has plenty of manpower
protecting him of course
but thats the least of it
beeps
pilot there you go
the sydney opera house
and the harbour bridge
crain cooks paranoia
is only trumped by his ego
exhibit a his cantilever pool
the walls and floors are all concrete
threefeet thick
every door is made
of sixinch nickel chromium steel
thats like 12 armor plates
and the biometric sensors
and retina readers at the access points
are impossible to hack
its a fortress in the sky
elevator dings
indistinct chatter

as a tragic accident
effectively ruling out foul play

groaning

whirring
crain bishop if you pull
another stunt like that
our deal is off and youll never
see your little girlfriend again
now playtimes over
go to the port town of varna
on the black sea
indistinct chatter
thats where youll find
your third kill
sirens wailing in distance
his name is max adams
a wealthy american arms dealer
on the north side of varna
youll find a truly vulgar memorial
to bulgarian communism
adams spent a fortune restoring it
and putting in the most
comprehensive security system
indistinct chatter
but the interesting part
is what you dont see
camera whirs and clicks
hidden in the mountainside
below is the sub pen
adams stocks his uboats with
intercontinental ballistic missiles
nobody gets in or out
many have died trying
so needless to say this will be
the hardest site to penetrate by far
on top of all that krill and cooks
deaths may have adams on the defense
you have 24 hours
bishop youre using me
to take out the competition
ambulance sirens wailing
indistinct chatter
sirens wailing

speaking bulgarian
we will dispatch a helicopter

call me when you know something
guard on intercom
no sign of the intruder mr adams
thats because hes sitting

here in the safe room jackoff
magnificent
even if it is all stolen and looted
cubofuturist totalitarianism
of course its magnificent
like uh dinosaur bones
its ugly
who the fuck are you
im here to talk
lose your cell phone
i shouldve hired
those guys from houston
all right what is it
that you want to talk about
i want to help you avoid an accident
krill cook that was you
i warned those guys that one day crain
would come after all of us
cappuccino espresso
espresso no sugar
coffee machine whirs
krill was a warlord but also the
numberone arms dealer in africa
cook used his mining empire as a cover
to control the asian franchise
you have got europe
and most of south america
north america too
if you count mexicans
that didnt leave much for crain
so i have a deal for you
hmm well im a dealer
we can talk about it
adams ive been called
a lot of ugly names over the years
communist socialist racist fascist
none of which is true of course
well
im certainly not a communist
bishop you just admire
their architecture
adams i believe in fair play
i saw the david and goliath story
play out on the frontlines of vietnam
soviets in afghanistan
ethnic cleansing in bosnia
chemical weapons on the kurds
the little guy is always
gonna need a slingshot
and somebodys always gonna pay for it
an arms dealer with a moral clause
mmmhmm
lets talk about crain
we both need him gone
the question is how do we accomplish
that hes got an army around him
we need something tempting enough so
that crain uses his men to go after it
what do you have in mind
your submarine pen
have them search
for weapons treasure
your corpse
what
youll have to die
well thats easy
although it will cost
a tremendous amount of money
you can afford it
indistinct chatter
adams

and mr adams fell into the water
his security they tried to reach him
but the rocks came down
and he was buried under the water
gone
gasping
sighs

so goddamn invigorating
stay out of sight for two days
after that you can
invigorate all you want
panting
