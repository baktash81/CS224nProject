ive got him get back here now
husband yells babe
husband babe
ive got your gun
whose camera is that
how am i supposed to know that
aand are you sure
that what you saw was even a camera
am i sure that yes it was a camera
where does it go
husband i have no idea
also you know as well as i do
once something is recorded digitally
if it even was
its just out there
theres nothing you can do about it
its not like a 7eleven
where you can go in the back
andand tear out a hard drive
everyones an idiot to you huh
no not everyone
you lied to me
husband im not lying
we have no security cameras
on our property
really just like theres no gun
speaking of which how about we establish
some some ground rules on that gun
meaning what
meaning i have no idea
how much youve used or been around guns
but if youre going to be pointing it
at one of us you can point at me okay
i havent pointed it at anybody yet
i know that all im saying is
we know you have a gun
were not going anywhere
and to prevent any fucking
makes gunshot noises oopsiedoopsies
just put the safety on
safetys on
so nothing accidental
husband great but the question remains
what do you want me to do
its the same situation guys
its not the same situation
not if my face is out there
not if i have to hide from this
you think five grand is gonna cut it
all thats changed is
the amount you need right
am i right
we still all all three of us
we have to find a way through this
so it comes down to how much and how soon
so how much
to what to disappear start a new life
looks like thats what its going to take
so you know
a hundred a hundred
hundred fifty thousand dollars
husband chuckles
what what is so fucking funny
hundred fifty thousand
hundred fifty thousand
you think thats enough
yeah ii think youre going to want more
if you were looking for
any reasonable quality of life
yes thats right
something tells me
that maybe you and i have
some very different pictures
of quality of life
oh most definitely we do
but either way
i dont think 150000 is going to cut it
youre going to blow through it
like that snaps
double it then threeÂ hundred thousand
babe where was this cutthroat negotiator
when we were doing our prenups
wife chuckles
uh anyway
one mans opinion
i think were still too low
great then lets uh lets add a zero
three million
laughing
what are you laughing at
well nnow youre just
youre sounding ridiculous
excuse me arent you worth
several billion dollars now or something
whatever im rumored to be worth
which is actually much more
that still doesnt mean
that i can just pick up a little red phone
and withdraw however much money
whenever i want
thats not the way it works
also if im asking
for three million dollars
well dont you think
that might set off a few alarm bells
which isnt exactly
what you want correct
fine then what is
whats the most that you can get
whats the what is the max
you dont want the max
i want the f
i want the max whats the max
im the only one here
that has actually been inside a room
with over a million dollars in it
now there are certain limitations
to that kind of money
not only the amount
but how much does that money weigh
how much can i physically carry
do you have any idea
how much three million dollars weighs
how much
well i dont know the actual weight
thats not the point
point is that you have to think about
how much can fit inside one suit
just tell me the amount
okay just tell whwhats the
whats the number
husband chuckles
guys i have to use the bathroom
what
i waited as long as i could
so how we gonna do this
man hey hold on
hold on
this curtain stays open
wait what i i cant go like that
whats the problem
privacy
okay uh theres an option b
which is you pick a corner
of the living room and do your business
im fine either way
tempting
husband groans
exhales
okay
grunts
husband hmm
got it
yeah
husband so why me
i mean other than the obvious reason
why did you target my house
i think the less we know
about each other the better dont you
this does not seem random to me
it seems like you knew
there would be no security cameras
toilet flushes
and it seems you expected us to be gone
due diligence on your part
much better
foreboding music playing
husband fourÂ hundred fifty thousand
man lets round it up
even 500
just feels right to me
okay we could do that but the problem
ii remember
if im having any trouble
carrying the extra 50 ill uh
ill leave it in your pool
half a mil it is
lets go get you your money
foreboding music rising
its working
hey
stay where i can see you
no hey snaps audio audio only
husband mutters
every time i call on the computer
its on video
yeah
well i dont care not this time
have you ever called someone
for a quick emergency delivery of 500k
yes just last week i did
okay look i can get you the money
it will however
require a little fucking finesse
if i call and ask my assistant
to arrange this kind of cash
and dont do it facetoface
that might seem a little suspicious
im gonna be standing right here
perfect
right here
and if you so much as blink
in a way that i find questionable
were gonna have a problem okay
so no no nosescratching
no uh no code words
okay matt helm copy that

debbie huh
youre a real class act
you dont fucking know me
go fuck yourself
moody music playing
no knives
wife clears throat
wife sighs what
are we supposed to make small talk
well ii mean
you guys could talk to each other
or is that not something youre used to
not at gunpoint no
its not like we can ask you your name
or where youre from
or what you do or did for a living
and well its sunny out
so the weathers covered
hobbies and favorite color
probably are safe
him ive read plenty about
but youre a mystery
so why dont you start
my favorite colors black
i can tell
whats this tattoo
youre getting removed on your foot
husband how about
you stop looking at my wifes feet yeah
it was nothing
man the tattoo was nothing
that was one of the ugliest tattoos
ive ever seenÂ in my life
yeah i know
youve made that pretty clear
coughs laughs
yikes
lets keep uh spinning this wheel
howd you two meet
honey
um we met at a fundraiser
cystic fibrosis
muscular dystrophy
back when i was an assistant
ah
got it
you were his assistant
no not his assistant an assistant
the route most people take
unless of course youve made a fortune
or rob people in their homes
or work for your husband
wife i work with him
okay i head up our foundation
a job im highly qualified for
having worked for nonprofits
since before college
its probably very similar
except now you just have
all this money to play around with
im not playing around with anything
its its not a game okay
and not that i have to justify
my resume to you
but now im in charge of building
schools and hospitals
on four continents
you are justifying
so you can try
and belittle what i do all you want
but results speak for themselves
and you can go ahead
and question my motives
but at least i know what ill be doing
for the next 4 or 5 years
thats not exactly true
youll be taking on
more of an advisory role
once we have a baby
right babe
clicks tongue right thats the plan
gloomy music plays
did i or one of my companies do something
to harm or offend you personally
in some way
it really feels like you hate me
man huh
i dont fucking get it
how can people be so mad at me
its like fucking being mad at
a fucking clock
if youre mad at a clock
thats really on you
its not about the clock
im supposed to apologize for writing
an algorithm that was inevitable
and that saves companies and enriches
the lives of hundreds of employees
man laughs derisively
did i say something funny
yeah
hearing you talk about
enriching peoples lives is funny to me
husband do i not do that
you know
its really pretty fucking rudimentary
a bloated fat company dies
all jobs lost
or a leaner more efficient version
of that same company survives
some jobs survive
if anything im helping people find
a new career path thats more sustainable
but you however
you are here for the sole purpose
of enriching yourself
man you have no idea what im here for
or even if that money is just for me
its meaningless to you anyway
money that could change
any other persons life
i just doubt
youre going to give it all to the poor
gloomy music continues
hey what is this
what does it look like
its a zen garden
just like the little ones you see
on peoples desks but big
last time i was here
i had the idea of putting in
a mr miyagistyle fence so its in
remember
yeah i still dont know what that means
a mr miyagistyle fence
all right guys whats uh
whats up next on the agenda
what other shit
you have around here you dont use
horses neighing
wife laughing
horse neighs
wife laughs
actor gurgling onscreen
actor spits
brooding instrumental music playing
good work
you need to get close to him babe
win him over
what what are you
we dont know this guy
we dont know what he intends to do
once he gets the money
so you need to get close to him
do whatever it takes okay
i dont
do whatever it takes thats it
you can do it
man all right
either of you have a preference
i still dont understand why you think
its necessary to split us up
yeah well like i said
for my peace of mind
so why dont you go ahead and choose
babe
do you have a preference
ii dont care
why dont you take this one over here
not like either one of us
are going to sleep anyways
just remember ill be right over here
the whole night okay
okay
wife sniffs
okay
yeah
man doors stay open
husband shut the light off
man if it helps you
brooding music continues
fire crackling
cant sleep wife sighs
okay
its gonna be a long night
yeah
followed by a very long day
wife chuckles
and the only man i know who could
fall asleep during his own kidnapping
chuckles
i guess its one of those if you dont
laugh you cry moments huh
clears throat
do you mind
no i dont mind
wife exhales
wife exhales
your life is gonna be
very different after tomorrow
my life became very different the second
you two walked through the front door
i was almost gone too
i was leaving
couldnt help myself
what are you gonna do
the end of the day
everything being totally different
thats okay with me
i get that
oh you do
i think everyone feels that
at least once or twice in their life
do you
there was a time i didnt know
what i wanted to do with myself
like anybody else
then you found your purpose with him huh
he and i found it together
picture perfect
picture perfect
thats great
you guys are trying to have a kid
thats what he said
we are
congratulations
that takes any relationship
to a whole new level
must be tricky if one person
is really rarin to go
and the other person
isnt quite as ready right
not my business though
no
thats not my business at all
like we said picture perfect
what about you
you said before we didnt know
if the money was just for you
youre asking if i have a girlfriend
or if theres anyone
mm
you dont have to answer obviously
yeah im not going to
you want that
can pops
clears throat its a lot for you
the uh the money thats coming
its a lot for anybody
should be
the way he was able to get
that much cash together so quickly
he said it was
for another debbie didnt he
you know what fuck it
ill take one sighs
oh
thats good
thank you
mmhmm
sighs im supposed to be so grateful
and just take everything in stride
because look at my life
and the good that i get to do
but uh the truth is i
i miss my old life
inhales i miss my friends
and i miss feeling normal
okay im sorry i just
and um
im sure youre a nice person
but youre not some victim
youre just a person who made a trade
you know that right
youre just like the rest of us
i knew i wasnt marrying just him
i can remember
on my wedding day
everyone was just waiting
and i was standing there
staring down at my feet
and if i went forward
if i walked down the aisle
i knew exactly what would happen
in the next 30 or 40 years
i knew
and if i went back
if i didnt walk down the aisle
ii wasnt sure what to expect
but it would have been mine
my choice and mine alone
maybe for the very last time
i went forward
but if im being honest i
i didnt know if i would
until i took that very first step
well
well what
was it worth it
ask me again in 30 or 40 years
um sighs all right well
i uh i should get some sleep
night
exhales
object scraping
thanks
ill take a bloody mary too thanks
wrong side of the bed love
was there a right side
sniffs
mysterious music playing
so what company was it
husband huh
you cant help yourself huh
you were deemed redundant
and let go
thats it right
its okay you can tell me
i know what youre trying to do
just drop it
now i owe you something right
if you owe a debt
its to a hell of a lot more people
than just me
because of your little math equation
peoples jobs disappear
just like that snaps
dont even have time to prepare
prepare for what exactly
ask the coal miners
if theyre prepared for clean energy
theres this new thing going around
this new trendy mentality you know of
i exist so therefore you owe me
are you familiar with this
that is the very reason why we live
in a world full of
lazy fucking loafers and freeloaders
theyre too busy
sitting bitching and moaning
that when theyre confronted
with an obstacle its just groans
morosely i guess thats it
cries mockingly
but i recognized the opportunity
and i did something about it
every single fucking time
i didnt ask anyone for anything
and i didnt take anything
that wasnt fucking mine
not everyone who needs help
is a freeloader
babe i was not referring
to you or your charity
it was not a personal attack
it is personal
i needed help okay
and you paid my student loans
am i a freeloader
no
no because you dont
think like that do you
