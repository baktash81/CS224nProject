too big to carry or too easy to trace 
so that s it 
and you have our phones 
there s no landline 
no landlines  no security cameras 
and we don t have neighbors for miles 
we don t even know them 
so  for us  it s like you were never here

some shit was already missing

 phone ringing

 car engine turns over 
 engine shuts off 
 moody music plays

 tense music plays

   husband yells  babe 
 husband  babe 
i ve got your gun 
whose camera is that 
how am i supposed to know that 
a and are you sure
that what you saw was even a camera 
am i sure that    yes  it was a camera 
where does it go 
 husband  i have no idea 
also  you know as well as i do 
once something is recorded digitally   
if it even was   
it s just out there 
there s nothing you can do about it 
it s not like a 7 eleven
where you can go in the back
and and tear out a hard drive 
everyone s an idiot to you  huh 
no  not everyone 
  you lied to me 
   husband  i m not lying 
we have no security cameras
on our property 
really  just like there s no gun 
speaking of which  how about we establish
some    some ground rules on that gun 
  meaning what 
  meaning i have no idea
how much you ve used or been around guns 
but if you re going to be pointing it
at one of us  you can point at me  okay 
i haven t pointed it at anybody yet 
i know that  all i m saying is 
we know you have a gun 
we re not going anywhere 
and to prevent any fucking 
 makes gunshot noises   oopsie doopsies 
just put the safety on 
safety s on 
so  nothing accidental 
 husband  great  but the question remains 
what do you want me to do 
it s the same situation  guys 
it s not the same situation 
not if my face is out there 
not if i have to  hide from this 
you think five grand is gonna cut it 
all that s changed is
the amount you need  right 
am i right 
we still all    all three of us 
we have to find a way through this 
so it comes down to how much and how soon 
so  how much 
to what  to disappear  start a new life 
looks like that s what it s going to take 
so  you know 
a hundred    a hundred   
hundred fifty thousand dollars 
 husband chuckles 
what  what is so fucking funny 
  hundred fifty thousand 
  hundred fifty thousand 
you think that s enough 
yeah  i i think you re going to want more 
if you were looking for
any reasonable quality of life 
yes  that s right 
something tells me
that maybe you and i have
some very different pictures
of quality of life 
oh  most definitely we do 
but either way 
i don t think 150 000 is going to cut it 
you re going to blow through it
like that   snaps 
double it  then  three hundred thousand 
babe  where was this cutthroat negotiator
when we were doing our prenups 
 wife chuckles 
uh  anyway 
one man s opinion 
i think we re still too low 
great  then let s  uh  let s add a zero 
three million 
   laughing 
  what are you laughing at 
well  n now you re just   
you re sounding ridiculous 
excuse me  aren t you worth
several billion dollars now or something 
whatever i m rumored to be worth 
which is actually much more 
that still doesn t mean
that i can just pick up a little red phone
and withdraw however much money
whenever i want 
that s not the way it works 
also  if i m asking
for three million dollars 
well  don t you think
that might set off a few alarm bells 
which isn t exactly
what you want  correct 
fine  then what is   
what s the most that you can get 
what s the    what is the max 
you don t want the max 
i want the f   
i want the max  what s the max 
i m the only one here
that has actually been inside a room
with over a million dollars in it 
now  there are certain limitations
to that kind of money 
not only the amount 
but how much does that money weigh 
how much can i physically carry 
do you have any idea
how much three million dollars weighs 
how much 
well  i don t know the actual weight 
that s not the point 
point is that you have to think about
how much can fit inside one suit   
just tell me the amount 
okay  just tell    wh what s the   
what s the number 
 husband chuckles 
guys  i have to use the bathroom 
what 
i waited as long as i could 
so  how we gonna do this 
 man  hey  hold on 
hold on 
this curtain stays open 
wait  what  i  i can t go like that 
  what s the problem 
  privacy 
okay  uh  there s an option b 
which is you pick a corner
of the living room and do your business 
i m fine either way 
  tempting 
   husband groans 
 exhales 
okay 
 grunts 
 husband  hmm 
got it 
yeah 
 husband  so why me 
i mean  other than the obvious reason 
why did you target my house 
i think the less we know
about each other  the better  don t you 
this does not seem random to me 
it seems like you knew
there would be no security cameras 
   toilet flushes 
   and it seems you expected us to be gone 
due diligence on your part 
much better 
 foreboding music playing 
 husband  four hundred fifty thousand 
 man let s round it up 
even 500 
just feels right to me 
okay  we could do that  but the problem   
i i remember 
if i m having any trouble
carrying the extra 50  i ll  uh 
i ll leave it in your pool 
half a mil it is 
let s go get you your money 
 foreboding music rising

have you ever called someone
for a quick emergency delivery of 500k 
yes  just last week i did 
okay  look  i can get you the money 
it will  however 
require a little fucking finesse 
if i call and ask my assistant
to arrange this kind of cash 
and don t do it face to face 
that might seem a little suspicious 
i m gonna be standing right here 
  perfect 
  right here 
and if you so much as blink
in a way that i find questionable 
we re gonna have a problem  okay 
so  no    no nose scratching 
no  uh  no code words 
okay  matt helm  copy that 
who the fuck is matt helm

 moody music playing 
no knives 
 wife clears throat 
 wife sighs  what 
are we supposed to make small talk 
well  i i mean 
you guys could talk to each other 
  or is that not something you re used to 
  not at gunpoint  no 
it s not like we can ask you your name
or where you re from
or what you do  or did  for a living 
and  well  it s sunny out 
so the weather s covered 
hobbies and favorite color
probably are safe 
him  i ve read plenty about 
but you re a mystery 
so why don t you start 
my favorite color s black 
i can tell 
what s this tattoo
you re getting removed on your foot 
 husband  how about
you stop looking at my wife s feet  yeah 
it was nothing 
 man  the tattoo was nothing 
that was one of the ugliest tattoos
i ve ever seen in my life 
yeah  i know 
you ve made that pretty clear 
 coughs  laughs 
yikes 
let s keep  uh  spinning this wheel 
how d you two meet 
honey 
um  we met at a fundraiser 
  cystic fibrosis 
  muscular dystrophy 
back when i was an assistant 
ah 
got it 
you were his assistant 
no  not his assistant  an assistant 
the route most people take 
unless  of course  you ve made a fortune
or rob people in their homes 
or work for your husband 
 wife  i work with him 
okay  i head up our foundation 
a job i m highly qualified for 
having worked for non profits
since before college 
it s probably very similar 
except now you just have
all this money to play around with 
i m not playing around with anything 
it s  it s not a game  okay 
and not that i have to justify
my resume to you 
but now i m in charge of building
schools and hospitals
  on four continents 
  you are justifying 
 so you can try
and belittle what i do all you want 
but results speak for themselves 
and you can go ahead
and question my motives 
but at least i know what i ll be doing
for the next 4 or 5 years 
that s not exactly true 
you ll be taking on
more of an advisory role
once we have a baby 
right  babe 
 clicks tongue  right  that s the plan 
 gloomy music plays 
did i or one of my companies do something
to harm or offend you personally
in some way 
it really feels like you hate me 
 man  huh 
i don t fucking get it 
how can people be so mad at me 
it s like fucking being mad at
a fucking clock 
if you re mad at a clock 
that s really on you 
it s not about the clock 
i m supposed to apologize for writing
an algorithm that was inevitable
and that saves companies and enriches
the lives of hundreds of employees 
 man laughs derisively 
  did i say something funny 
  yeah 
hearing you talk about
enriching people s lives is funny to me 
 husband  do i not do that 
you know 
it s really pretty fucking rudimentary 
a bloated  fat company dies 
all jobs lost 
or a leaner  more efficient version
of that same company survives 
some jobs survive 
if anything  i m helping people find
a new career path that s more sustainable 
but you  however 
you are here for the sole purpose
of enriching yourself 
 man  you have no idea what i m here for 
or even if that money is just for me 
it s meaningless to you  anyway 
money that could change
any other person s life 
i just doubt
you re going to give it all to the poor 
 gloomy music continues 
hey  what is this 
  what does it look like 
  it s a zen garden 
just like the little ones you see
on people s desks  but big 
last time i was here 
i had the idea of putting in
a mr  miyagi style fence  so it s in 
remember 
yeah  i still don t know what that means 
a mr  miyagi style fence 
all right  guys  what s  uh 
what s up next on the agenda 
what other shit
you have around here you don t use 
 horses neighing

 brooding instrumental music playing 
good work 
you need to get close to him  babe 
win him over 
what  what are you   
we don t know this guy 
we don t know what he intends to do
once he gets the money 
so  you need to get close to him 
do whatever it takes  okay 
  i don t   
  do whatever it takes  that s it 
you can do it 
 man  all right 
either of you have a preference 
i still don t understand why you think
it s necessary to split us up 
yeah  well  like i said 
for my peace of mind 
so  why don t you go ahead and choose 
babe 
  do you have a preference 
  i i don t care 
why don t you take this one over here 
not like either one of us
are going to sleep anyways 
just remember  i ll be right over here
the whole night  okay 
okay 
 wife sniffs 
okay 
yeah 
 man  doors stay open 
   husband  shut the light off 
   man  if it helps you 
 brooding music continues 
 fire crackling 
can t sleep   wife sighs 
okay 
it s gonna be a long night 
yeah 
followed by a very long day 
 wife chuckles 
and the only man i know who could
fall asleep during his own kidnapping 
 chuckles 
i guess it s one of those  if you don t
laugh  you cry  moments  huh 
 clears throat 
do you mind 
no  i don t mind 
 wife exhales 
 wife exhales 
your life is gonna be
very different after tomorrow 
my life became very different the second
you two walked through the front door 
i was almost gone  too 
i was leaving 
couldn t help myself 
what are you gonna do 
the end of the day 
everything being totally different 
that s okay with me 
  i get that 
  oh  you do 
i think everyone feels that
at least once or twice in their life 
do you 
there was a time i didn t know
what i wanted to do with myself 
like anybody else 
then you found your purpose with him  huh 
he and i found it together 
picture perfect 
picture perfect 
that s great 
you guys are trying to have a kid 
that s what he said 
we are 
congratulations 
that takes any relationship
to a whole new level 
must be tricky if one person
is really rarin  to go
and the other person
isn t quite as ready  right 
not my business  though 
no 
that s not my business at all 
like we said  picture perfect 
what about you 
you said before we didn t know
if the money was just for you 
you re asking if i have a girlfriend 
or if there s anyone 
mm 
you don t have to answer  obviously 
yeah  i m not going to 
you want that 
 can pops 
 clears throat  it s a lot for you 
the  uh  the money that s coming 
it s a lot for anybody 
should be 
the way he was able to get
that much cash together so quickly 
he said it was
for another debbie  didn t he 
you know what  fuck it 
i ll take one   sighs 
oh 
that s good 
  thank you 
  mm hmm 
 sighs  i m supposed to be so grateful 
and just take everything in stride 
because  look at my life 
and the good that i get to do 
but  uh  the truth is  i 
i miss my old life 
 inhales  i miss my friends 
and i miss  feeling normal 
  okay  i m sorry  i just   
  and  um   
i m sure you re a nice person 
but you re not some victim 
you re just a person who made a trade 
you know that  right 
you re just like the rest of us 
i knew i wasn t marrying just him 
i can remember 
on my wedding day 
everyone was just waiting 
and i was standing there 
staring down at my feet 
and if i went forward 
if i walked down the aisle 
i knew exactly what would happen
in the next 30 or 40 years 
i knew 
and if i went back 
if i didn t walk down the aisle 
i i wasn t sure what to expect 
but it would have been mine 
my choice and mine alone 
maybe for the very last time 
i went forward 
but if i m being honest  i 
i didn t know if i would
until i took that very first step 
well 
well  what 
was it worth it 
ask me again in 30 or 40 years 
um   sighs   all right  well 
i  uh  i should get some sleep 
night 
 exhales

i ll take a bloody mary  too  thanks 
wrong side of the bed  love 
was there a right side 
 sniffs 
 mysterious music playing 
so  what company was it 
 husband  huh 
you can t help yourself  huh 
you were deemed  redundant 
and let go 
that s it  right 
it s okay  you can tell me 
i know what you re trying to do 
just drop it 
now  i owe you  something  right 
if you owe a debt 
it s to a hell of a lot more people
than just me 
because of your little math equation 
people s jobs disappear
just like that   snaps 
  don t even have time to prepare 
  prepare for what  exactly 
ask the coal miners
if they re prepared for clean energy 
there s this new thing going around 
this new trendy mentality  you know  of 
 i exist  so  therefore  you owe me  
are you familiar with this 
that is the very reason why we live
in a world full of
lazy fucking loafers and freeloaders 
they re too busy
sitting  bitching  and moaning
that when they re confronted
with an obstacle  it s just   groans 
 morosely   i guess that s it  
 cries mockingly 
but i  recognized the opportunity 
and i did something about it
every single fucking time 
i didn t ask anyone for anything 
and i didn t take anything
that wasn t fucking mine 
not everyone who needs help
is a freeloader 
babe  i was not referring
to you or your charity 
it was not a personal attack 
it is personal 
i needed help  okay 
and you paid my student loans 
am i a freeloader 
no 
no  because you don t
think like that  do you 
do you

for you to enjoy 
your children
