we were
closing up about this
audio commentary piece

it didnt age well
oh yeah we
we appreciate your candor
we had we had a different
view of it here though
i mean musicians for the most part
are pretty much monosyllabic teenagers
who really dont have that much to say
and thats the good ones right
so what are we doing here
the music industry is fine
its always gonna be fine
we always have been fine
maybe the kids are right
maybe music should be free anyway

oh really and you find that
a big surprise
seeing how you let you let
her walk out of the house
looking like l like
jodie foster from taxi driver
she dresses the way she wants to
and besides any daughter
who dresses like that
only wants one thing
a pimp
no dan think about it
a daddy

she needs some guidance

thirty seconds after youre gone

whenever youre alone

with god all right

if they dont get it right
you just need to work on
your performance a bit
im not a performer
i write songs from time to time
are all the songs
as good as that one
are you really an ar man
you look more like a homeless man
ive been celebrating all weekend
i signed a band and we got carried away
thats some song you got there
i promise you it could be a big hit
plus youre beautiful
sorry whats beauty
got to do with anything
jesus youre tricky arent you
no i actually just think
that music is about ears
not eyes
and im not judy garland
just off a greyhound bus
looking for stardom
but really thank you
ok bye
bye
ok heres the truth
i couldnt have signed you
if i wanted to all right
ok
i didnt come from a signing tonight
i havent signed anybody in seven years
my labels completely lost
all faith in me
so why did you give me your card
force of habit if i look homeless
its because i practically am
i left my home about a year or so ago
im sleeping on a shitty mattress
in some shitty apartment
and i wasnt celebrating tonight
i was drinking my ass off
standing on a subway platform
ready to kill myself
and then i heard your song
want to get a beer
sure
ok come on
dan mulligan born 1966
headed ar department
at island records for two years
left to cofound indie label
distressed records
with harvard classmate saul byron
so you own distressed records
i sold all my interests
due to emotional difficulties
what emotional difficulties
i was too emotional read on
very active on the hiphop scene
in new york in the early 90s
the pair were responsible
for discovering
numerous breakthrough artists
won two grammys as producer
lives in new york
with wife music journalist
miriam hart and their daughter
what happened to the grammys
i pawned them
you pawned them
how much did you get for them
125 for the both of them
which got me nice and wasted
one weekend a couple months ago
were you drunk when you heard my song
absolutely
thats when the magic happens
what magic
i hear things
you hear things
arrangements
you need to be drunk
for that sort of thing
you mustve been drunk tonight
because nobody else heard anything
no your songs good
its you
standing up there like a tomboy
i dont mean to be offensive
but dont you think that looks
a little passé
really
seriously
we get you a look
and a killer video
and youll go straight to the top
im thinking norah jones
singersongwriter thing at a piano
or the or the cardigans
back in the day when they
when they first came to america
maybe even deborah harry
a male band behind you
what you find that amusing
no im sorry something
went down the wrong way
sorry no you were saying me with
a cardigan on norah jones
babe who the fuck
do you think you are
youre gonna stand up
on a stage with a beatup guitar
and you think youre
carole fucking king
no i just think that an ar man
telling an artist how they should dress
or come across is total bullshit
people dont want that
they want authenticity
ok babe
authenticity
give me the name of one artist that
you think passes your authenticity test
dylan
dylan
that is the most cultivated artist
you couldve thought of
his hair his sunglasses
he changes his look every decade
randy newman
i fucking love randy newman
ok you got me on that
listen to me
i am not saying that you cant be
a real bona fide motherfucker
in this business

shitass label needs
im glad
you cant just barge in here
you cant come in like this

uh because thats our arrangement
you got somebody here

so where are we going mr ar man
were going to my partner to play him
your music got your demo
no
you dont have a demo
no
do you have myspace
or facebook or anything
myspace no i
no i dont i just
i you know i told you
i write songs from time to time
what do you write them for
what do you mean what for
for my pleasure and for my cat
oh really
does he like them
she yes she seems to
how do you know
because she purrs
maybe shes booing
no she purrs at leonard cohen too
and she has very good taste
maybe shes fucking with you
can we stop talking about cats now
ok
ok
fuck it lets do this
the oldfashioned way
thank you gretta
thanks very much thanks for coming in
im just gonna take
a moment to talk with dan for a minute
thank you
im not into it
its a little undercooked for me
she seems to have kind of
an attitude problem and
what are you looking for man
what you want some
some little teenage pop star
whose moms been raising her
since two years old for stardom
i mean
no thats not what im looking for
but if you know someone
like that i mean
just give me the money to make the demo
ill take her into the studio
get a hotshit producer get a couple
session musicians dial the thing out
then you can hear what im hearing
and then you can tell me to fuck myself
people send us their demos
its not the other way around
we dont we dont make demos
were prospectors man
were investors
were digging for gold
make a tape
and well get back to you
thats the best i can
do right now bro
so ive been thinking
why do we even need
to rent a fucking studio
because you need a desk
a live room and soundproofing
laptop pro tools
a couple dynamic mics
and the city is our fucking live room
you mean record outside
thats right
like where
everywhere
fuck him we dont need a demo
lets lets record an album
every song we do in a
different location
all over new york city
and we do it through the summer
and it becomes this tribute
to this beautiful
goddamn crazy fractured mess
of a city new york
ok like under the bridge
on the lower east side
top of the empire state building
rowing boats in the lake
in central park
chinatown cathedral
of saint john the divine
ok in the subway
in fucking harlem everywhere ok
ok so what happens
if it starts raining
whatever happens we record it
if we get arrested
keep rolling itll be beautiful
you like it
what do you think
its good
its good come on
will you produce it
me
yeah
no i havent produced
in a long time
well get somebody young to produce it
no but i want you to do it
why
because i do
ill give you strings
but we definitely need piano
fill in the guitars underneath
got it i love it done
done
the worlds first jag
mobile recording studio
is done
its bloody genius it is
where do you want to go
we need musicians
terminally miserably bored musicians
and after that i think
then you bring in the violin and cello
first cello then violin
when we get into that guitar thing
i want it to just become
a whole different kind of song
this is malcolm
malcolm is a child prodigy
hes been playing violin
since he was five years old
i technically started when i was four
four
wow
and this is his older sister rachel
shes at the manhattan school of music
on a full scholarship
topofherclass cellist
thats amazing
so heres the deal
i cant afford to pay you up front
so i want to offer you a
a legitimate backend deal
sound good
yeah as long as its
not fucking vivaldi
its not fucking vivaldi
its great no no no
im not its great
we definitely need piano
like fill in the guitar underneath
major seventh
got it i love it
steve beautiful
zach whats going on
i quit
good luck girls
bye
keep in touch yeah
when we get into that guitar thing
i want it to just become
a whole different kind of song

so why dont you
i mean she obviously

what are you the fucking
social services now

it must have been fairly tense
for you to leave
especially seeing as how much
she obviously wants you around
i im gonna split
ill see you tomorrow morning
fuck man
fuck that shit
dan
hey look im sorry
im sorry
what what do you want from me
what game are you playing
what does that mean
look i just
what
i saw how sweet she was today
and i just felt sorry
for you being away from that
that is such a crock of shit
you were back there judging me
you think that i left
that relationship
because im some sort
of selfish depressed prick
which i am by the way
no i dont think
youre a selfish depressed prick
i think youve let your troubles
get in the way of your entire life
oh babe babe
youre really showing
your age right now
you have no idea what happens
between two people
after 18 years of marriage
all right
and because youre willing
to hang around for some asshole
after he totally betrayed you
thats your business
im sorry youre right
i put a lot of time and
effort into that relationship
and no im not just walking away
because of a bump in the road
bump in the road
i left that relationship
because i was having
a fucking nervous breakdown
and she was out there
fucking some other guy
planning how she was gonna start
a new life with him
when i was here taking care of my kid
you have no fucking clue
what youre talking about
you know nothing
she goes to europe
to work on a junket and um
she ends up meeting
and falling in love with a singer
bang boom thunder lightning
fireworks the whole bit
and
the arrangement was
that they were gonna come back
and tell their partners
that theyd fallen in love
and they were gonna spend
the rest of their lives together
and so i go to the airport
to pick her up
and she just comes outwith it
first off whole story
and next day her bags are all packed
and were telling violet
whats gonna happen
so what did happen
he choked
he got on the airplane
went back to his life
turned his phone off
and she never heard from him again
i move into another bedroom
shes waiting around for
a phone call that never comes
and i turn into a
i lose my shit a little bit
im so sorry
no
maybe people in the music industry
just dont make good life partners
or fathers
yeah it certainly looks that way
i didnt mean about the fathers bit
you make a very good father
yeah right
maybe just not a good partner
what is that
this
yeah
thats a splitter
oh
its for uh two headphones
going into one input
yeah
its actually
from my first date with miriam
it is
what do you mean
we walked all over the city
listening to her cd player
um
i dont think we said more than
two words to each other the whole night
that was new years eve
and we were married two months later
wow
thats lovely
what kind of music you got
on your phone
im not giving you access
to my music library im really not
theres a lot of embarrassing
very guilty pleasures in there
mine too you can tell a lot about
a person by whats on their playlist
i know you can
thats whats worrying me
so are we gonna do this
ok
ok lets do it
this is a really good choice
oh yeah
genius
genius
perfect right
yeah yeah
great
yeah
yeah
oh no i forgot
what
ok ok we got to dance
what
we got to dance
all right all right
yeah we got to
where
we got to dance
this way i know i know i know
this way
ok so im quite frightened
cause you might find this cheesy
but it is one of my favorite songs
from one of my favorite films
so are you ready
its good right
thats what i love about music
what
one of the most banal scenes
is suddenly invested
with so much meaning you know
all these banalities
theyre suddenly turned
into these
these beautiful effervescent pearls
from music
ive got to say as ive gotten older
these pearls are just
becoming increasingly
more and more rare to me
more string than pearls
yeah youve got to travel
over a lot more string
to get to the pearls
this moment is a pearl gretta
it sort of is isnt it
all this has been a pearl
hey guys
hi
hello steve
come on and check it out
your boyfriend just won a music gong
no way
you wont believe it
done something to his face
wow thank you so much
im a bit taken aback by this
this is incredible
uh it just proves that a guy
from nowhere can actually make it
if he follows his dreams
ive been practicing this speech
into a shampoo bottle
in the shower my entire life
yeah
uh gosh thank you
nice beard you fucking loser
what dreams we never
had those dreams
i dont remember those dreams
how do you know
because i know him
maybe they were private dreams
maybe he just never told you about them
who was i living with
for the last five years
baby youve been living
with a rock star
only he didnt know it
it didnt matter
but now that he does
ive got to tell you
these people get married to it
they fall in love with the music
they fall in love with the lights
they fall in love with the road
the chicks all that shit
and no matter how hard he tries
hes never gonna be able
to make a woman happy
all right
see you in the morning
he just looks a dick
why would he do that
i dont know
why would anyone
ill tell you why hed do it
he wants to look like the guy who
doesnt realize ive grown a beard
i was so busy lost inside
myself writing music
i didnt realize id grown
a beard the size of my neck
im gonna sound
quite cheesy over it
i loved him like a fool
i dont think thats cheesy i think
that sounds like a phenomenal song
does it
yeah it sounds like a song
i think it sounds like
a song you should write right now
right now
write it down
write it down write it down
ok ok

a posh english girl
say it like someone in new york

grueling punishing
inspiring

you certainly found a beard anyway
look at that thing
yeah
its its intense
its big
yeah
did mim go with you
on tour
you want to go straight into this then
yeah
are you
are you the happiest couple ever
or did you break up after a month
and she came back
to new york on a bus
it was a train actually
im sorry
im being a bitch
no youre entitled
so
what have you been up to
god
its amazing gretta
really
totally
ambient sound and the city
thats it
no overdubs nothing
no no no its just
the way you hear it
god its so great
yeah
theyre really offering you a deal
no well i dont know
he has to play it to his
partner first so well see
i cannot believe
what hes done with your songs
i know hes amazing
you should get him to do your record
no its too late
we just finished mastering
the record in la
i recorded in various
studios on the road
wow so whats it called
on the road
oh
kind of like kerouac
yeah yeah it is
thats actually a
terrible album name
no i
i mean it worked for him
no its bad
its
i know that you know its bad too
no im
you know
anyway would you like to go hear it
i would love to hear it
ok
all right
what do you think
i think i need to listen to it again
no no i want
i want your immediate reaction
my immediate reaction
mmhmm
ok um
i i think that youve lost
the songs in the production
you know
i mean ok take lost stars
i wrote it as a as a ballad
and i dont know
it sounds like a piece of stadium pop
ooh
yeah but i wanted to
turn it into a hit
why
why what kind of question is that
youre the writer
you get sole writing credit on it
this is huge for you
yeah but i mean
you werent supposed to lose the song
in it you know i mean its
its delicate
i really i just
i think you should get it remixed
ah but everyone loves it
when we do it its amazing
you have to come see it live
the reaction to it
the energy in the room just changes
why are you so worried
about what other people think
its its our song
it is but you know
isnt that what music is about
its about sharing it with people
no not that song dave
ok well good then
who do we get to remix this
mim maybe you should
get mim to remix it
really ok so this is obviously
not anything about the album
you think
dont dont become this like
music biz couple you know
arguing about our um
our albums
the funny thing about this is that id
throw that fucking record into the ocean
if we could just continue
this conversation right now
this is what i want to
talk about ok
and if i could somehow
say something or do anything
that would undo
what i did to us then
just tell me what it is
help me
would you
would you throw it in the ocean
would you
would you want me to
no
no i just
you know i think
i think everythings changed
and im im just
finding it a bit hard to adjust
i know it makes sense
but were just gonna have
to find a way to
get through this
get through this together
when did you like
when did you realize that
when you sang to me on my voicemail
i realized that nobody on earth
in their right mind
would ever do anything remotely
like that and that killed me
that crushed me
you
completely won me over
i wasnt trying to win you over
i was trying to tell you to fuck off
and i had and
and now you know youve
youve come back and
and youve opened the whole thing up
again and i think actually i think
i think im gonna have to go
um take that
im gonna go
cause its all a bit much
i hear you just
take your time
im not going anywhere
youre gonna stay on the bench
yes im gonna live on this bench
uhhuh
come to the gramercy
on saturday please

i want you to see
how everyones just falling
in love with what you created

lets start a band

i love you
i know you do
hey
come on
yeah so pretty
bye
thanks for coming in guys
this is fantastic
you got a great record
and i missed it on the first listen
but i dont want to miss it again
were very glad that
you like it so
well i reached out to some
of my studio connects in la
and i was thinking
we can get the first track
placed in a in a film
the right film
theres also pilot season right now
yeah were not interested
in any of that stuff
ok so then what are you
interested in what are we doing here
well i think dan needs his job back
yeah sure what
take my office i dont care
ok all right so how i mean
i guess i want to know
how does this work
we put the album out
we sell it for
lets say an album
costs ten dollars a unit
the artist gets a dollar
same in publishing
its a buck for a book
i think im just thinking
for this specifically
to get my head around it
um i mean the album
it doesnt have any overhead
because we did it
yeah
and then distribution
i mean its not gonna go in stores
its gonna go online and publicity
would be what word of mouth
so i think what im wondering is
why do you get nine out
of ten of my dollars
gretta youre
a very smart young woman
and uh youre a determined artist
and you have a you have
a wonderful project here
and with the right team behind you
to push you and guide you
in the right direction and maybe hire
a producer to remix a couple tracks
you could have a hit record
and a very long career
but you know ultimately thats
thats up to you
ah you had them
you wound him up
i know its amazing when
youre not actually that interested
you always win the hand
yeah thats never really
worked out that well for me
i mean i found it worked very well
yeah
youre gonna get a deal
that asshole is gonna
give you a deal babe
you might have to
compromise a little bit but
never
of course
hey we should do a bunch of these
what do you mean
could do like the uh
the european series
i like that
paris tapes prague sessions
the berlin recordings
yes
go all over europe by rail
we could take the whole gang
you know
rachel malcolm steve
so
so
look l guess
ill see you in a while
thank you
thank you so much
oh man
thank you
guitar change all right
all right
uh so this next song
was actually given to me
by an amazing songwriter
and an even more amazing woman
uh yeah so its a very special song
were gonna do her arrangement of it
so if shes here
im not sure that she is
uh id love her to come up
and join us on this one
theres a guitar right there so
you know if youre here please
please join us its a really
special song to me so
see your vision of this song through
hey
hey
where are you going
uh home
whats on your mind
ok um
i dont want your label
to release my album
fine
fine really
well
no because i thought
that youd be really upset
no its your album
so what do you want
to do with it then
there it is
yeah
thats the whole album for a dollar
a buck for a book
the whole thing
now once this goes out thats it
theyre gone
yeah
are you sure you want to do this
yeah
how about two bucks
youre such a capitalist
no a buck is fair and then you know
well split it evenly between everyone
and malcolm and rachel
everyone come on
once i press this thats it
im going to war with my whole business
mm
oh
thats so exciting
ok
