  shut up  i ve got something  listen 
   from the bbc in london 
the british government   
having received no reply
to the observations presented   
to the german government   
has declared war on nazi germany 
  that s wonderful  wonderful 
  it is expected that   
   within the next few hours  france
will make a similar declaration 
poland is no longer alone 
wonderful  wonderful 
  mama  that was a great dinner 
  it certainly was 
when there s something to celebrate

 further restrictions
regarding liquid assets 
jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2 000 zlotys at home  
  what do we do with the rest 
  deposit it in a bank  blocked account 
banks  who d be stupid enough
to deposit money in a german bank 
we could hide the money  look here 
we can hide it under the flowerpots 
i ll tell you what we ll do 
we ll use try and tested methods 
you know what we did
in the last war 
we made a hole in the table leg 
and hid the money in there 
  suppose they take the table away 
  what do you mean 
germans go into jewish homes and
take furniture  valuables  anything 
  do they 
  why d they want a table like this 
  what on earth are you doing 
  listen  look 
this is the best place  no one would
think of looking under the flowerpot 
  no  listen  i ve been thinking   
  really  that s a change 
  you know what  we use psychology 
  we use what 
we leave the money and the watch
on the table  covered  in full view 
  are you stupid 
  the germans will never notice it 
that s the stupidest thing i ve ever
seen  of course they ll notice  look 
look here 
idiot 
  and you call me stupid 
  very good  that s the last place   
  this would take hours 
  we re not in a hurry 
  it won t take hours 
  how will you get them out  tell me 
  how will you get them out 
  quiet  order  please 
  you reach them out individually 
  no one listens to me 
quiet  please  quiet 
order  order  please 
  the lawyer  she likes order 
  listen  just listen  look 
the watch we put under the flowerpot
and the money we stuff in the violin 
  but i ll still be able to play 
  you ll find out 
  jurek  it s wladek szpilman 
  wladek  how are you 
we re fine  thank you 
and you 
fine  under the circumstances 
i guess i know why you re calling 
there s nothing we can do 
they won t reopen the station 
  yes  i know  but i   
  no music  no radio for the polish 
but sure you ll find work 
a pianist like you 
maybe  maybe not  but   
don t be offended  but i didn t call
to discuss my future carrier 
i nagged jurek for weeks and weeks 
and at last he gave in and said   
 all right  come with me tomorrow  
so i came and   
they bombed the station 
  meeting you like that was wonderful 
  really 
yes  it was unforgettable 
  i love your playing  mr  szpilman 
  call me wladek  please 
  no one plays chopin like you 
  i hope it s a compliment 
  of course  i mean it 
  i was    trying to be funny 
  should we go and have a coffee

  and you  what do you do 
  i finished with the conservatoire 
  you re a musician

  good bye

official decree 
no jews allowed in the park 
  my god  are you joking

we can just stand here and talk 
i think we re allowed to do that 
so  you play the cello  that s nice 
and who s your favorite composer 
chopin  really  well   
you ll have to learn to play
his cello sonata  won t you 
what about you  wladek 
perhaps i could accompany 
me on the piano  you on the cello 
mr  szpilman  you re quite 
quite wonderful 
call me wladek  please

i m sorry  i did my best 
  i thought the certificates d save us 
  stop it  wladek 
let s just hope that henryk
and halina will be better off 
  where will we be going

  can you hear what i m saying 
  i m telling you  it s a disgrace 
  i can hear you 
letting them take us to our death
like sheep to the slaughter 
  not so loud 
  why don t we attack them 
there s half a million of us here 
we can break out of the ghetto 
at least we can die honorably  not
as a stain on the face of history 
why are you so sure they re
sending us to our death 
you know why i m not sure 
because they didn t tell me 
  they re going to wipe us all out 
  what do you want me to do  fight 
to fight  we need organization 
plans  guns 
he s right  do you think i m going
to fight with my violin bowl 
the germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this 
they re sending us to a labor camp 
it s obvious 
sure 
look at that cripple  the old people 
the children  they re going to work 
look at you  you re going to carry
logs on your back 
henryk  halina  henryk 
i missed you 
i wanted to be with you 
i wanted to be with you 
stupid  stupid 
why did i do it  why did i do it 
she s getting on my nerves 
  what did she do  for god s sake 
  she smothered her baby 
they prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there 
the baby cried
just as the police came 
she smothered the cries with
her hands  the baby died 
a policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding 
what are you reading 
 if you prick us  de we not bleed 
if you tickle us  do we not laugh 
if you poison us  do we not die 
and  if you wrong us 
shall we not revenge  
  very appropriate 
  yes  that s why i brought it 
idiot  what does he think
he s gonna do with the money 
boy  come here

until things die down 
i ve bribed the policeman 
he ll come when it s over 
attention 
on the march

my god  i haven t been outside in 
it must be two years 
don t get overexcited 
it s gold 
very good price

her husband is an actor 
they re good people 
i d like to talk to her 
don t forget  wladek

down on the ground 
turn left 
on the march 
how long have you been here 
since last night 
i was pleased to see you 
they re going to start
the final resettlement now 
we know what it means 
we sent someone out 
zygmund  a good man 
his orders were to follow
the trains out of warsaw 
he got to sokolow 
a man told him the tracks divided 
one branch s leading to treblinka 
he said everyday freight trains
carrying people from warsaw   
branch off to treblinka
and return empty 
no transports of food
are ever seen on that line 
the civilians are forbidden
to approach the treblinka station 
they re exterminating us 
it won t take them long 
we are 60 thousand left 
out of half a million 
mostly young people 
and this time we re gonna fight 
we re in good shape 
organized 
we re prepared 
if you need help  i   
you  come here 
shit 
i m sorry  i m sorry 
i don t know what i was thinking 
take this  take this 
take him away 
i hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks 
he won t last long
if he goes on like this 
i ll see if i can get him
something better 
trouble 
round up only the jews 
round up 
only the jews 
the polish keep working 
only the jews 
i have good news for you 
there are rumors going around
that we like to   
to resettle you 
i promise you that now
and in the future   
nothing else is planned 
for this reason  we put
information posters on the wall 
to show you our goodwill   
you should vote one of you
to be allowed   
to go in town daily   
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes   
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers 
so  why should we do something
like this if we d resettle you 
you can make good business
out of the things you don t eat 
isn t that something that you jews
are good in  making money 
dismiss them 
that one  with the string 
the others  tied by wire 
now 
majorek

what are you up to 
what have you got there 
we are allowed to take
food to the ghetto 
three kilos of potato and bread 
open it

we reach you with a finger   
and you take the whole hand 
if you lie to me again

i ll teach you some discipline 
you dirty jews 
do you know why
