shut up ive got something listen
from the bbc in london
the british government
having received no reply
to the observations presented
to the german government
has declared war on nazi germany
thats wonderful wonderful
it is expected that
within the next few hours france
will make a similar declaration
poland is no longer alone
wonderful wonderful
mama that was a great dinner

when theres something to celebrate
youve got to make an effort
heres to great britain and france

look
further restrictions
regarding liquid assets
jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2000 zlotys at home
what do we do with the rest
deposit it in a bank blocked account
banks whod be stupid enough
to deposit money in a german bank
we could hide the money look here
we can hide it under the flowerpots
ill tell you what well do
well use try and tested methods
you know what we did
in the last war
we made a hole in the table leg
and hid the money in there
suppose they take the table away
what do you mean
germans go into jewish homes and
take furniture valuables anything
do they
whyd they want a table like this
what on earth are you doing
listen look
this is the best place noone would
think of looking under the flowerpot
no listen ive been thinking
really thats a change
you know what we use psychology
we use what
we leave the money and the watch
on the table covered in full view
are you stupid
the germans will never notice it
thats the stupidest thing ive ever
seen of course theyll notice look
look here
idiot

i guess i know why youre calling
theres nothing we can do
they wont reopen the station
yes i know but i
no music no radio for the polish
but sure youll find work
a pianist like you
maybe maybe not but
dont be offended but i didnt call
to discuss my future carrier
i nagged jurek for weeks and weeks
and at last he gave in and said
all right come with me tomorrow
so i came and
they bombed the station
meeting you like that was wonderful
really
yes it was unforgettable
i love your playing mr szpilman

i finished with the conservatoire
youre a musician

im going in there to complain
its better not believe me
its humiliating someone like you
goodbye
well find somewhere else
we can walk in the park
no we cant
official decree
no jews allowed in the park
my god are you joking
im not joking its true
we could sit in a bench but
no jews allowed on public benches

so you play the cello thats nice
and whos your favorite composer
chopin really well
youll have to learn to play
his cello sonata wont you
what about you wladek

because they didnt tell me
theyre going to wipe us all out
what do you want me to do fight

shes getting on my nerves
what did she do for gods sake
she smothered her baby
they prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there
the baby cried
just as the police came
she smothered the cries with
her hands the baby died
a policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding
what are you reading
if you prick us de we not bleed
if you tickle us do we not laugh
if you poison us do we not die
and if you wrong us
shall we not revenge
very appropriate

how long have you been here
since last night
i was pleased to see you
theyre going to start
the final resettlement now
we know what it means
we sent someone out
zygmund a good man
his orders were to follow
the trains out of warsaw
he got to sokolow
a man told him the tracks divided
one branchs leading to treblinka
he said everyday freight trains
carrying people from warsaw
branch off to treblinka
and return empty
no transports of food
are ever seen on that line
the civilians are forbidden
to approach the treblinka station
theyre exterminating us
it wont take them long
we are 60 thousand left
out of half a million
mostly young people
and this time were gonna fight
were in good shape
organized
were prepared
if you need help i
you come here
shit
im sorry im sorry
i dont know what i was thinking
take this take this
take him away
i hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks
he wont last long
if he goes on like this
ill see if i can get him
something better
trouble
round up only the jews
round up
only the jews
the polish keep working
only the jews
i have good news for you
there are rumors going around
that we like to
to resettle you
i promise you that now
and in the future
nothing else is planned
for this reason we put
information posters on the wall
to show you our goodwill
you should vote one of you
to be allowed
to go in town daily
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers
so why should we do something
like this if wed resettle you
you can make good business
out of the things you dont eat
isnt that something that you jews
are good in making money
dismiss them
that one with the string
the others tied by wire
now
majorek
