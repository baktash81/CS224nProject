 static crackling on monitor
then stops 
it was unclear what she was 
at least to someone 
this was a test 
we were difficult to spot then 
was there anything unusual
about how you found her 
to warrant an official investigation 
you know how people are
about old serial numbers 
everyone just sleeps better
when they know where they got to 
she likes him 
who 
this officer deckard 
she s trying to provoke him 
it is invigorating
being asked personal questions 
makes one feel   
   desired 
do you enjoy your work  officer 
please thank mr wallace for your time 
k 
you worked with officer deckard   
   back in the day 
what can you tell me about him 
he liked to work alone 
so did i 
so we worked together
to keep it that way 
that was it 
anything else you can tell me 
he sure wasn t long for this world 
how so 
something in his eyes 
any idea how i could contact him 
none 
he s nyugdíjas  
retired 
what happened

i make good angels now 
that is how i took us
to nine new worlds 
nine 
a child can count to nine on fingers 
we should own the stars 
yes  sir 
every leap of civilisation was built off
the back of a disposable workforce 
we lost our stomach for slaves   
   unless engineered 
but i can only make so many 
that barren pasture   
   empty   
   and salted   
   right here 
the dead space between the stars 
 whispering  and this  the seat
that we must change for heaven 
 replicant grunts 
 in normal voice  i cannot
breed them  so help me  i have tried 
we need more replicants
than can ever be assembled 
millions  so we can be trillions more 
we could storm eden and retake her 
tyrell s final trick 
procreation 
perfected  then lost 
but there is a child 
bring it to me

considering i was never a child 
well  would it help you share
if i told you it was an order 
i have one about a toy that i had 
a wooden horse 
with an inscription underneath 
all i remember is a group of boys
trying to take it away from me 
so i run 
i go looking for a place to hide it 
and the only place is this dark furnace 
it s very dark  and i m very scared   
   but this horse is all i have 
so i go in anyway 
later on  those kids find me   
   and they beat me to tell them
where it is  but i don t

sorry 
it s a compromised immune system 
a life of freedom 
so long as it s behind glass 
  is that why you re not off world 
  yes 
my parents had our passes in pocket 
but i took sick 
so it was a new life for me 
and they put me in my cage   
   filled it with everything they could
to keep me happy 
except company  of course 
and i was used to crowds 
what can i help you with 
thought you might be able to help me
with a case 
oh  that s the most interesting thing
i ve been offered to help with in ages 
do you mind if i work while you talk 
of course 
ana 
i promise i hear every word 
they say you re
the best memory maker there is 
well  then  they re kind 
i love birthday parties

you work for wallace 
ana 
subcontract  i m one of his suppliers 
he offered to buy me out 
but i take my freedom where i can find it 
why are you so good 
what makes your memories
so authentic 
ana  well  there s a bit of every artist
in their work 
but i was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8   
   so if i wanted to see the world 
i had to imagine it 
got very good at imagining 
wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product 
i think it s only kind 
replicants live such hard lives 
made to do what we d rather not 
i can t help your future   
   but i can give you good memories
to think back on and smile 
it s nice 
ana  it s better than nice 
it feels authentic 
and if you have authentic memories 
you have real human responses 
wouldn t you agree 
 inhales deeply 
are they all constructed 
or do you ever use ones that are real 
ana 
it s illegal to use real memories  officer 
how can you tell the difference 
can you tell if something   
   really happened 
they all think it s about more detail 
but that s not how memory works 
we recall with our feelings 
anything real should be a mess 
i can show you 
sit

  you two live here together 
  too many questions 
i had your job  i was good at it 
  it was simpler then 
  why you making it complicated 
  why don t you answer the question 
  what question 
i didn t figure you as one for bullshit 
what s her name 
rachael 
her name was rachael 
what happened to the kid 
who put it in the orphanage 
was it you 
i was long gone by then 
you didn t even meet your own kid 
why 
because that was the plan 
i showed them how to scramble
the records  cover their tracks 
everyone had a part 
mine was to leave 
then the blackout came 
paved over everything 
couldn t have found the child if i tried 
  did you want to 
  not really 
  why not 
  because we were being hunted 
i didn t want our child found   
   taken apart  dissected 
sometimes  to love someone   
   you gotta be a stranger 
to strangers 
  it s quarter to three  
  there s no one in the place  
  except you and me  
  so set  em up  joe  
  i got a little story  
  you ought to know

mariette  hey  there s someone
who wants to meet you 
you can trust us 
you must want me to look up
and to the left 
mariette 
this is freysa 
she fought with sapper on calantha 
k 
i recognise you 
did you help him hide the child 
oh   
i was there 
i saw a miracle delivered 
a perfect little face crying up at me 
mad as thunder 
were you with her 
rachael 
freysa 
i held her as she died 
we hid the child
and made a vow to keep our secret 
that s why sapper let you kill him 
i knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves 
if a baby can come from one of us   
   we are our own masters 
more human than humans 
freysa 
a revolution is coming 
and we re building an army 
i want to free our people 
 footsteps approaching 
if you want to be free   
   join us 
deckard  sapper  you  me   
   our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that s coming 
dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do 
you led wallace to deckard 
you cannot allow deckard
to lead wallace to me 
you must kill deckard 
deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe 
and she is 
when the time comes 
i will show her to the world   
   and she will lead our army 
 she  
of course 
rachael had a daughter 
with my own eyes  i saw her come 
i dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go 
it was a boy that you hid 
that is just a piece of the puzzle 
you imagined it was you 
oh 
you did 
you did 
we all wish it was us 
that s why we believe 
ana 
someone lived this  yes 
deckard  i showed them
how to scramble the records   
   cover their tracks 
freysa  with my own eyes  i saw her come 
i dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go 
ana  there s a bit of every artist in their work 
 grunts 
 buzzing 
wallace 
always jumping  that one 
never a thought of what to do
if it made land 
all the courage in the world
cannot alter fact 
i have wanted to meet you
for so very long 
you are a wonder to me  mr deckard 
i had the lock 
i found the key 
yet the pins do not align 
the door remains locked 
i need the specimen to reach it 
mr deckard 
the child 
i need the child 
to teach them all to fly 
and god remembered rachel   
   heeded her and opened her womb 
rachael  over speakers   do you like our owl

deckard 
decka rd 
wallace 
is it the same   
   now  as then   
   the moment you met her 
all these years
you looked back on that day   
   drunk on the memory
of its perfection 
how shiny her lips 
how instant your connection 
did it never occur to you that s why
you were summoned in the first place 
designed to do nothing short
of fall for her right then and there 
all to make that single perfect specimen 
that is  if you were designed 
love   
   or mathematical precision 
yes 
no 
i know what s real 
 sighing 
it was very clever
to keep yourself empty of information   
   and all it cost you was everything 
but you can still help me 
you had help in the hiding 
where did they go 
i know you know something 
help me   
   and very  very good things
can come to you 
you don t have children   
   do you 
oh  i have millions 
you think i have nothing to offer but pain 
only i know   
   you love pain 
pain reminds you
the joy you felt was real 
more joy  then 
do not be afraid 
an angel   
   made again 
for you 
did you miss me 
don t you love me 
her eyes were green 
wallace 
off world    
   i have everything i need
to make you talk 
you do not know what pain is yet 
you will learn
