it was unclear what she was
at least to someone
this was a test

about how you found her
to warrant an official investigation
you know how people are
about old serial numbers
everyone just sleeps better
when they know where they got to
she likes him
who
this officer deckard
shes trying to provoke him
it is invigorating
being asked personal questions
makes one feel
desired
do you enjoy your work officer
please thank mr wallace for your time
k
you worked with officer deckard
back in the day
what can you tell me about him
he liked to work alone

every leap of civilisation was built off
the back of a disposable workforce
we lost our stomach for slaves
unless engineered
but i can only make so many
that barren pasture
empty
and salted
right here
the dead space between the stars
whispering and this the seat
that we must change for heaven
replicant grunts

from when you were a kid
i feel strange sharing a childhood story
considering i was never a child
well would it help you share
if i told you it was an order
i have one about a toy that i had
a wooden horse
with an inscription underneath
all i remember is a group of boys
trying to take it away from me
so i run
i go looking for a place to hide it
and the only place is this dark furnace
its very dark and im very scared
but this horse is all i have
so i go in anyway
later on those kids find me
and they beat me to tell them
where it is but i dont

its just unusual
nice to meet you officer kd6  37
sorry
its a compromised immune system
a life of freedom
so long as its behind glass
is that why youre not offworld
yes
my parents had our passes in pocket
but i took sick
so it was a new life for me
and they put me in my cage
filled it with everything they could
to keep me happy
except company of course
and i was used to crowds
what can i help you with
thought you might be able to help me
with a case
oh thats the most interesting thing
ive been offered to help with in ages
do you mind if i work while you talk
of course
ana
i promise i hear every word
they say youre
the best memorymaker there is
well then theyre kind
i love birthday parties
kids chattering
k
you work for wallace
ana
subcontract im one of his suppliers
he offered to buy me out
but i take my freedom where i can find it
why are you so good
what makes your memories
so authentic
ana well theres a bit of every artist
in their work
but i was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8
so if i wanted to see the world
i had to imagine it
got very good at imagining
wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product
i think its only kind
replicants live such hard lives
made to do what wed rather not
i cant help your future
but i can give you good memories
to think back on and smile
its nice
ana its better than nice
it feels authentic
and if you have authentic memories
you have real human responses
wouldnt you agree
inhales deeply
are they all constructed
or do you ever use ones that are real
ana
its illegal to use real memories officer
how can you tell the difference
can you tell if something
really happened
they all think its about more detail
but thats not how memory works
we recall with our feelings
anything real should be a mess
i can show you
sit
now think about the memory
you want me to see

because that was the plan
i showed them how to scramble
the records cover their tracks
everyone had a part
mine was to leave
then the blackout came
paved over everything
couldnt have found the child if i tried
did you want to
not really
why not
because we were being hunted

i was there
i saw a miracle delivered
a perfect little face crying up at me
mad as thunder
were you with her
rachael
freysa
i held her as she died
we hid the child
and made a vow to keep our secret
thats why sapper let you kill him
i knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves
if a baby can come from one of us
we are our own masters
more human than humans
freysa
a revolution is coming
and were building an army
i want to free our people
footsteps approaching
if you want to be free
join us
deckard sapper you me
our lives mean nothing
next to a storm thats coming
dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do
you led wallace to deckard
you cannot allow deckard
to lead wallace to me
you must kill deckard
deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe
and she is
when the time comes
i will show her to the world
and she will lead our army
she
of course
rachael had a daughter
with my own eyes i saw her come
i dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go
it was a boy that you hid
that is just a piece of the puzzle
you imagined it was you
oh
you did
you did
we all wish it was us
thats why we believe
ana
someone lived this yes
deckard i showed them
how to scramble the records
cover their tracks
freysa with my own eyes i saw her come
i dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go
ana theres a bit of every artist in their work
grunts
buzzing
wallace
always jumping that one
never a thought of what to do
if it made land
all the courage in the world
cannot alter fact
i have wanted to meet you
for so very long
you are a wonder to me mr deckard
i had the lock
i found the key
yet the pins do not align
the door remains locked
i need the specimen to reach it
mr deckard
the child
i need the child
to teach them all to fly
and god remembered rachel
heeded her and opened her womb
rachael over speakers do you like our owl
deckard over speakers
its artificial
rachael
of course it is
deckard
must be expensive
rachael
very im rachael
deckard
decka rd
wallace
is it the same
now as then
the moment you met her
all these years
you looked back on that day
drunk on the memory
of its perfection
how shiny her lips
how instant your connection
did it never occur to you thats why
you were summoned in the first place
designed to do nothing short
of fall for her right then and there
all to make that single perfect specimen
that is if you were designed
love
or mathematical precision
yes
no
i know whats real
sighing
it was very clever
to keep yourself empty of information
and all it cost you was everything
but you can still help me
you had help in the hiding
where did they go
i know you know something
help me
and very very good things
can come to you
you dont have children
do you
oh i have millions
you think i have nothing to offer but pain
only i know
you love pain
pain reminds you
the joy you felt was real
more joy then
do not be afraid
an angel
made again
for you
did you miss me
dont you love me
her eyes were green
wallace
offworld
i have everything i need
to make you talk
you do not know what pain is yet
you will learn
thunder rumbling
classical music plays
woman over speakers
hello handsome
what a day hm
you look lonely
i can fix that
you look like a good joe
moans
freysa dying for the right cause
