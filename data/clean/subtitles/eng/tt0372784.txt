  finders keepers  and i found it 
in my garden 
finders keepers 
bruce 
 wood snapping 
 thud 
bruce 
mom  mr  alfred 
 whimpers 
 screaming 
 men screaming in distance 
did you have dream 
nightmare 
worse than this place 
 guard speaking foreign
language over p a  
old prisoner  whispering  
they are going to fight you 
  again 
  until they kill you 
can they kill me before breakfast 
you are in hell  little man 
and i am the devil 
you re not the devil 
you re practice 
 grunting 
 gunshots 
guard 
solitary 
  why 
  for protection 
  i don t need protection 
  protection for them 
 inmates groaning 
get in 
ducard  are you so
desperate to fight criminals   
   that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time 
actually  there were seven of them 
i counted six  mr  wayne 
how do you know my name 
the world is too small for someone
like bruce wayne to disappear   
   no matter how deep
he chooses to sink 
who are you 
my name is merely ducard 
but i speak for ra s al ghul   
   a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld 
a man who can offer you a path 
what makes you think i need a path 
someone like you
is only here by choice 
you have been exploring
the criminal fraternity   
   but whatever
your original intentions   
   you have become truly lost 
and what path can ra s al ghul offer 
the path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil   
   and wishes to serve true justice 
the path of the league of shadows 
 chuckles 
  you re vigilantes 
  no  no  no 
a vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification 
he can be destroyed or locked up 
but if you make yourself more
than just a man   
   if you devote yourself to an ideal   
   and if they can t stop you   
   then you become
something else entirely 
which is 
legend  mr  wayne 
tomorrow  you will be released 
if you are bored of brawling with petty thieves
and want to achieve something   
   there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes 
pick one of these flowers 
if you can carry it
to the top of the mountain   
   you may find what you were
looking for in the first place 
and what was i looking for 
only you can know that 
 indistinct chattering 
you turn back  you go back 
bruce 
ra s al ghul 
ducard 
wait 
 speaking foreign language 
 translating 
what are you seeking 
i seek   
   the means to fight injustice 
to turn fear   
   against those
who prey on the fearful 
 speaking foreign language 
ducard  translating  
to manipulate the fears in others   
   you must first master your own 
are you ready to begin 
i can    i can barely stand 
death does not wait
for you to be ready 
death is not considerate or fair 
and make no mistake 
here you ll face death 
tiger 
jujitsu 
panther 
you re skilled  but this is not a dance 
and you are afraid 
but not of me 
tell us  mr  wayne   
   what do you fear 
 bats squeaking 
bruce 
it s okay  it s okay 
you ll be okay 
alfred  will we be needing
an ambulance  master wayne 
thomas  no  i ll set the bone
and take him for an x ray later 
alfred 
very good  sir 
  i m very sorry  sir  i ve told   
thomas  don t worry  it s fine 
alfred  took quite a fall 
didn t we  master bruce 
thomas 
and why do we fall  bruce 
so we can learn to pick ourselves up 
just a little fall 
it s just a small fracture 
thomas 
the bats again 
you know why they attacked you 
don t you 
  they were afraid of you 
  afraid of me 
all creatures feel fear 
even the scary ones 
especially the scary ones 
i got something to show you 
  you think your mother will like them 
  yeah 
  i think it s time to get up 
  maybe 
thomas 
no going back to bed 
did you build this train  dad 
gotham s been good to our family 
but the city s been suffering 
people less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times 
so we built a new  cheap  public
transportation system to unite the city 
and at the center   
   wayne tower 
bruce  is that where you work 
  no  i work at the hospital 
i leave the running of our company
to much better men 
  better 
  well   
   more interested men 
 performers singing 
 choir and orchestra 
 gasping 
can we go 
please 
okay  let s go 
  what s wrong  bruce 
  no  no  it was me 
i just needed some fresh air 
a little bit of opera goes a long way 
right  bruce 
come on  let s go 
wallet  jewelry  come on  fast 
thomas  that s fine 
chill  fast

thomas  whispering  
bruce

loeb 
gordon 
hey 
good news 
we got him  son 
you re in excellent hands 
we ll be watching the empire 
when you grow up 
it ll be waiting for you 
i thought i might prepare a little supper 
  very well 
  alfred 
  yes  master bruce 
  it was my fault  alfred 
  i made them leave the theater 
  no  no  no 
  if i hadn t gotten scared   
  it was nothing that you did 
it was him  and him alone 
do you understand 
i miss them  alfred 
i miss them so much 
so do i  master bruce 
so do i 
ducard  and do you still feel
responsible for your parents  death 
my anger outweighs my guilt 
come 
you have learned to bury
your guilt with anger 
i will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth 
you know how to fight six men 
we can teach you how to engage 600 
you know how to disappear 
we can teach you
to become truly invisible 
invisible 
 speaking in foreign language 
the ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility 
 grunting 
always mind your surroundings 
ninjitsu employs explosive powders 
  as weapons 
  or distractions 
theatricality and deception
are powerful agents 
you must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent 
 man speaking
foreign language 
bruce  who is he 
  he was a farmer 
then he tried to take his neighbor s land
and became a murderer 
  now he is a prisoner 
  what ll happen to him 
justice  crime cannot be tolerated 
criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society s understanding 
your parents  death was not your fault 
it was your father s 
anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act 
  the man had a gun 
  would that stop you 
i ve had training 
the training is nothing 
will is everything 
the will to act 
yield 
you haven t beaten me 
you have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke 
ducard 
rub your chest 
your arms will take care of themselves 
you are stronger than your father 
you didn t know my father 
but i know the rage that drives you 
that impossible anger
strangling the grief   
   until the memory
of your loved one is just   
   poison in your veins 
and one day  you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed   
   so you d be spared your pain 
i wasn t always here in the mountains 
once  i had a wife 
my great love 
she was taken from me 
like you  i was forced to learn
there are those without decency   
   who must be fought
without hesitation  without pity 
your anger gives you great power 
but if you let it  it will destroy you   
   as it almost did me 
  what stopped it 
  vengeance 
that s no help to me 
why  bruce 
why could you not
avenge your parents 
will you be heading back to princeton
after the hearing  sir   
   or can i persuade you to stay on
for a day or two 
bruce 
i m not heading back at all 
alfred  you don t like it there 
  i like it fine 
they just don t feel the same way 
  i ve prepared the master bedroom 
  no 
my room will be fine 
alfred  with all due respect  sir 
wayne manor is your house 
bruce 
no  alfred  it s my father s house 
  your father is dead 
  this place is a mausoleum 
if i have my way  i ll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick 
this house  master wayne  has sheltered
six generations of your family 
why do you give a damn  alfred 
it s not your family 
i give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible   
   for what was most precious to him   
   in the whole world 
miss dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing 
she probably hopes
to talk you out of going 
bruce  should i just bury the past
out there with my parents  alfred 
i wouldn t presume to tell you
what to do with your past  sir 
just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future 
haven t given up on me yet 
never 
alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf 
hasn t he noticed
you re tall enough to reach now 
old habits die hard  i guess 
  never used to stop us anyway 
  no  it didn t 
how s your mom 
she misses this place 
so do i 
yeah 
but it s nothing without the people
who made it what it was 
  now there s only alfred 
  and you 
  i m not staying  rachel 
  you re just back for the hearing 
bruce  i don t suppose there s any way
to convince you not to come 
someone at this proceeding   
   should stand for my parents 
we all loved your parents  bruce 
  what chill did is unforgivable 
  then why is your boss letting him go 
in prison  he shared a cell
with carmine falcone 
he learned things  and he will testify
in exchange for early parole 
rachel  this man killed my parents 
i cannot let that pass 
and i need you
to understand that  please 
okay 
finch  the depression hit working
people  like mr  chill  hardest of all 
his crime was appalling  yes 
but it was motivated not by greed   
   but by desperation 
given the 14 years already served  as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation   
   with one of this office s
most important investigations   
   we strongly endorse his petition
for early release 
judge faden 
mr  chill 
chill 
your honor   
   not a day goes by that i don t wish
i could take back what i did 
sure  i was desperate 
like a lot of people back then   
   but that don t change what i did 
faden  i gather there is a member
of the wayne family here today 
has he got anything to say 
woman 1  he s coming out the side 
man 1  he s coming out the side  guys 
 clamoring 
man 2 
bruce wayne 
blonde female reporter 
joe  hey  joe 
falcone says hi 
 gunshot 
 people shouting 
rachel 
come on  bruce 
we don t need to see this 
i do 
rachel  the da couldn t understand
why judge faden insisted   
   on making the hearing public 
falcone paid him off
to get chill out in the open 
maybe i should be thanking them 
  you don t mean that 
  what if i do  rachel 
my parents deserved justice 
you re not talking about justice 
you re talking about revenge 
  sometimes  they re the same 
  no  they re never the same  bruce 
justice is about harmony  revenge is
about you making yourself feel better 
  it s why we have an impartial system 
  your system is broken 
 tires screeching
and horns honking 
you care about justice 
look beyond your own pain  bruce 
this city is rotting 
they talk about the depression
as if it s history  and it s not 
things are worse than ever down here 
falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs   
   preying on the desperate 
creating new joe chills every day 
falcone may not have killed
your parents  bruce   
   but he s destroying everything
that they stood for 
you wanna thank him for that 
here you go 
we all know where to find him 
as long as he keeps the bad people rich   
   and the good people scared 
no one ll touch him 
good people like your parents  who ll
stand against injustice  they re gone 
what chance does gotham have
when the good people do nothing 
  i m not one of your good people  rachel 
  what do you mean 
all these years  i wanted to kill him 
now i can t 
 slap 
your father would be ashamed of you 
you re taller than you look
in the tabloids  mr  wayne 
no gun  i m insulted 
  you could ve just sent a thank you note 
  i didn t come here to thank you 
i came here to show you that
not everyone in gotham s afraid of you 
only those who know me  kid 
look around you 
you ll see two councilmen   
   a union official 
couple off duty cops   
   and a judge 
now  i wouldn t have a second s hesitation of
blowing your head off right here and right now in front of them 
now  that s power you can t buy 
that s the power of fear 
i m not afraid of you 
because you think you got
nothing to lose 
but you haven t thought it through 
you haven t thought about
your lady friend down the da s office 
you haven t thought about
your old butler  bang 
people from your world   
   have so much to lose 
now  you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot   
   you know about the ugly side of life 
but you don t 
you ve never tasted desperate 
you re    you re bruce wayne 
the prince of gotham 
you d have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn t know your name 
so don t    don t come down here with your anger 
trying to prove something to yourself 
this is a world you ll never understand 
and you always fear   
   what you don t understand 
all right 
yeah  you got spirit  kid 
i ll give you that 
more than your old man anyway 
in the joint  chill told me about
the night he killed your parents 
he said your father begged for mercy 
begged 
like a dog 
should ve tipped better 
  for what 
  your jacket 
okay 
hey  hey  hey  let me have it 
it s a nice coat 
be careful who sees you with that 
  they re gonna come looking for me 
  who 
bruce 
everyone 
it s   
it s a nice coat 
ducard  when you lived among
the criminals  did you start to pity them 
bruce  the first time i stole
so that i wouldn  t starve  yes 
i lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong 
and when i traveled   
    i learned the fear before a crime   
    and then the thrill of success 
 officer shouting in mandarin 
bruce 
but i never became one of them 
 officer 1 speaking mandarin 
officer 2  fool  what the hell do i care
what your name is  you re a criminal 
 speaking mandarin 
i m not a criminal
officer 2 
tell that to the guy who owned these 
ducard  you ve traveled the world
to understand the criminal mind   
   and conquer your fears 
but a criminal is not complicated 
and what you really fear
is inside yourself 
you fear your own power 
you fear your anger   
   the drive to do great
or terrible things 
now you must journey inwards 
you are ready 
breathe 
breathe 
breathe in your fears 
face them 
to conquer fear 
you must become fear 
you must bask in the fear
of other men 
and men fear most
what they cannot see 
ducard  you have to become a terrible thought 
ducard  a wraith 
you have to become an idea 
ducard  feel terror cloud your senses 
ducard  feel its power to distort 
ducard  to control 
ducard  and know that this power
can be yours 
ducard  embrace your worst fear 
ducard  become one with the darkness 
 bats squeaking 
focus 
concentrate 
master your senses 
you cannot leave any sign 
bruce 
i haven t 
impressive 
 speaking foreign language 
ducard  translating  
we have purged your fear 
you are ready to lead these men 
you are ready to become a member
of the league of shadows 
but first  you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice 
 speaks foreign language 
no 
i m no executioner 
ducard  your compassion is
a weakness your enemies will not share 
that s why it s so important 
it separates us from them 
you want to fight criminals 
this man is a murderer 
  this man should be tried 
ducard  by whom 
corrupt bureaucrats 
criminals mock society s laws 
you know this better than most 
ra s al ghul 
you cannot lead these men   
   unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil 
and where would i be leading
these men 
gotham 
as gotham s favored son   
   you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality 
  how 
  gotham s time has come 
like constantinople or rome before it   
   the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice 
it is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die 
this is the most important function
of the league of shadows 
it is one we ve performed for centuries 
gotham   
   must be destroyed 
you can t believe in this 
ra s al ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts 
what he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary 
i will go back to gotham
and i will fight men like this   
   but i will not become an executioner 
bruce  please 
for your own sake 
there is no turning back 
  what are you doing 
  what s necessary  my friend 
 explosions 
 bruce screaming 
i will tell him you saved his life 
master wayne 
you ve been gone a long time 
  yes  i have 
  you look very fashionable 
apart from the mud 
are you coming back to gotham
for long  sir 
as long as it takes 
i want to show the people of gotham   
   their city doesn t belong
to the criminals and the corrupt 
in the depression  your father nearly
bankrupted wayne enterprises   
   combating poverty 
he believed that his example could inspire
the wealthy of gotham to save their city 
did it 
in a way 
their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action 
people need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy 
and i can t do that as bruce wayne 
as a man   
   i m flesh and blood 
i can be ignored  i can be destroyed 
but as a symbol   
as a symbol  i can be incorruptible 
  i can be everlasting 
  what symbol 
something elemental   
   something terrifying 
i assume that as you are taking on
the underworld   
   this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals 
you re thinking about rachel 
actually  sir  i was thinking of myself 
have you told anyone i m coming back 
i just couldn t figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead 
  dead 
  you ve been gone seven years 
you had me declared dead 
actually  it was mr  earle 
he s taking the company public 
he wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding 
those shares are worth
quite a bit of money 
well  it s a good thing
i left everything to you  then 
quite so  sir 
and you can borrow the rolls  if you like 
just bring it back with a full tank 
in my opinion  mr  zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others   
   and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation 
  dr  crane 
  ah  miss dawes 
you really think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn t belong in jail 
i would hardly have testified to that
otherwise  would i  miss dawes 
this is the third of carmine falcone s thugs
you ve had declared insane   
   and moved into your asylum 
the work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane 
rachel dawes  or the corrupt 
mr  finch 
i think you should check
with miss dawes here   
   just what implications your office
has authorized her to make  if any 
  what are you doing  rachel 
  what are you doing  carl 
finch 
looking out for you 
falcone has half the city
bought and paid for 
  drop it 
  how can you say that 
because as much as i care about
getting falcone  i care more about you 
that s sweet 
 sirens wailing 
we ve been through all that 
 bat squeaking 
alfred 
blessed bat again  sir 
they nest somewhere in the grounds 
 bats squeaking 
crane  no more favors 
someone is sniffing around 
hey  i scratch your back 
you scratch mine  doc 
i m bringing in the shipments 
we are paying you for that 
maybe money isn t as interesting
to me as favors 
i am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me  mr  falcone 
but you know who i m working for 
and when he gets here   
he    he s coming to gotham 
yes  he is 
and when he gets here 
he s not going to wanna hear   
   that you ve endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of a little jail time 
  who s bothering you 
  there s a girl at the da s office 
  we ll buy her off 
  not this one 
idealist  huh 
well  there s an answer to that too 
  i don t want to know 
  yes  you do 
board director  no  we are showing
very healthy growth in these sectors 
i don t think that thomas wayne would have
viewed heavy arms manufacture   
   as a suitable cornerstone
for our business 
well  that s 20 years ago  fredericks 
i think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves   
   to stop thinking about what
thomas wayne would have done 
jessica 
good morning  mr  earle s office 
yes  he s confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening 
bruce  good morning 
i m here to see mr  earle 
name 
bruce wayne 
thomas would probably not
have taken the company public 
but that is what we 
as responsible managers  are going to do 
jessica 
jessica  where are you 
bruce  eye on the ball  and   
  why is no one answering the phone 
it s wayne enterprises  mr  earle 
i m sure they ll call back 
bruce  you re supposed to be dead 
sorry to disappoint 
  i need you to take a look at this 
  have you seen him yet 
  who 
  wayne 
it s been all over the news 
he s back 
earle  i m sure you realize
i can t stop the big machine 
too many wheels turning 
  we re going public 
  i understand 
and i ll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares 
i m not looking to interfere 
  i am looking for a job 
  oh 
i just want to get to know the company
that my family built 
any ideas where you would start 
applied sciences caught my eye 
fox s department 
i ll let him know you re coming 
you look like him  your dad 
you re the only one left
of the wayne family 
this is where you belong

what did they tell you this place was 
bruce 
they didn t tell me anything 
earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here 
dead end 
a place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble 
come on 
  you were on the board 
  when your father ran things  yeah

  why didn t they put it into production

   a soldier s life was worth 300 grand 
so  what s your interest in it 
mr  wayne 
i want to borrow it 
for spelunking 
spelunking 
yeah  you know  cave diving 
you expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves 
look  i d rather mr  earle
didn t know about me borrowing   
mr  wayne   
   the way i see it   
   all this stuff is yours anyway 
okay  give it a try 
charming 
at least you ll have company 
this must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing 
in the civil war  your great great grandfather
was involved in the underground railroad   
   secretly transporting freed slaves
to the north   
   and i suspect these caverns
came in handy 
alfred  come up here 
i can see everything all right
from down here  sir  thank you very much 
alfred  we order the main part
of this cowl from singapore 
bruce 
via a dummy corporation 
indeed  and then  quite separately   
   we place an order
to a chinese company for these 
bruce  put it together ourselves 
alfred  precisely 
they ll have to be large orders 
to avoid suspicion 
bruce  how large 
alfred  say    10 000 
bruce  well  at least we ll have spares 
alfred  yes

  kind of 
do you have any lightweight fabrics 
you know  i think i have just the thing 
it s called memory cloth 
notice anything 
regularly flexible   
   but put a current through it   
   molecules realign  it becomes rigid 
  what kind of shapes can you make 
can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton 
too expensive for the army 
i don t think they ever tried to market it
to the billionaire  spelunking  base jumping crowd 
  look  mr  fox 
  yes  sir 
if you re uncomfortable   
mr  wayne  if you don t want to tell me
exactly what you re doing   
   when i m asked  i don t have to lie 
but don t think of me as an idiot 
fair enough 
what s that 
the tumbler 
oh  you wouldn t be interested in that 
she was built as a bridging vehicle 
during combat  two of these
would jump over a river  towing cables 
over here on the throttle 
flip that open and throttle up 
this will boost you into a rampless jump   
not now 
not    not now  sir 
computer 
afterburner disengaged 
we never could get
the damn bridge to work   
   but this baby works just fine 
so  what do you think 
does it come in black 
i need you at the docks thursday 
  problems 
  i don t want any trouble   
   with the last shipment 
  sure 
word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the da s office 
  is that right 
  and that there s a fat prize   
   waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it 
so  what s your point  mr  flass 
have you seen the girl 
flass  on radio  
it s a cute little assistant d a 
don  t you think that s a little too much
heat to bring down  maybe 
  even for this town 
  never underestimate gotham city 
people get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week 
sometimes   
sometimes things just go bad 
it s a problem with the graphite  sir 
the next 10 000
will be up to specifications 
  at least they gave us a discount 
  quite 
in the meantime  sir  may i suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head 
why bats  master wayne 
bats frighten me 
it s time my enemies shared my dread 
flass 
what is it 
continue 
looks fine out there 
flass 
the bears go straight to the dealers 
yeah  and the rabbits go
to the man in the narrows 
  what s the difference 
  ignorance is bliss  my friend 
don t burden yourself
with these secrets of scary people 
 steiss screams 
hey  steiss 
steiss 
thug 
what 
what the    
 screaming in distance 
 gunshots 
i better check it 
 panting 
there s a problem out here 
you better bail 
 thud 
 shouting  where are you  
batman  whispering   here 
 screams 
 grunting 
take a ride  oh  shit 
what the hell are you 
 glass shatters 
i m batman 
nice coat 
thanks 
hold it 
that s right  you better run 
 screams 
 electricity crackling 
falcone sent them to kill you 
  why 
  you rattled his cage 
  what s this 
  leverage 
  for what 
  to get things moving 
who are you 
someone like you 
someone who ll rattle the cages 
ma am  everything okay 
officer  falcone s men 
gordon  does it matter 
we ll never tie him to it anyway 
i wouldn t be too sure of that 
what the hell is that 
cut him down 
loeb 
unacceptable 
now  i don t care if it s rival gangs 
guardian angels   
   or the goddamn salvation army   
   get them off the street
and off the front page 
they say it was just one guy 
or a creature 
it was some asshole in a costume 
  yeah 
  this guy did deliver us   
   one of the city s biggest crime lords 
no one takes the law
into their own hands in my city 
understand 
rachel  no way to bury it now 
finch  maybe so  but there s still judge faden 
  i ve got faden covered 
  ok  what about this bat they babble about 
even if these guys will swear in court
to being thrashed by a giant bat   
   we ve got falcone at the scene 
drugs  prints  cargo manifests 
this bat character gave us everything 
okay  let s do it 
bruce  bats are nocturnal 
alfred  bats may be 
but even for billionaire playboys 
3 o clock is pushing it 
the price for leading a double life 
i fear 
your theatrics made an impression 
bruce 
theatricality and deception   
   are powerful weapons  alfred 
this is a good start 
if those are to be the first
of many injuries to come   
   it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse 
polo  for instance 
i m not learning polo  alfred 
strange injuries 
a nonexistent social life 
these things beg the question   
   as to what exactly does bruce wayne
do with his time and his money 
what does someone like me do 
drive sports cars  date movie stars 
buy things that are not for sale 
who knows  master wayne 
you start pretending to have fun   
   you might even have a little
by accident 
board director 
sir 
  we have a situation 
  all right 
the coast guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night   
   heavily damaged  all crew missing 
probably dead 
the ship was carrying
a prototype weapon 
it s a microwave emitter 
it s designed for desert warfare  but it   
   it looks like somebody   
   turned it on 
it uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy s water supply 
the damage to the ship
was catastrophic 
the weapon itself is   
missing 
yeah 
man 
mr  wayne 
nice car 
you should see my other one 
female guest  he s done something
the police have never done 
male guest  you can t take the law
into your own hands 
well  at least he s getting
something done 
male guest  bruce  help me out here 
  huh 
well  a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues 
but he s put falcone behind bars 
male guest  now the cops want to bring him in 
so  what does that tell you 
they re jealous 
sir  the pool is for decoration   
   and your friends
do not have swimwear 
well  they re european 
i m going to have to ask you to leave 
  it is not a question of money 
  well  you see   
   i m buying this hotel   
   and setting some new rules
about the pool area 
i think the batman deserves a medal 
and a straitjacket to pin it on 
doorman 
thank you 
bruce 
rachel 
i d heard you were back 
what are you doing 
just swimming here 
wow  it is good to see you 
you were gone a long time 
  i know  how are things 
  the same 
job s getting worse 
can t change the world on your own 
what choice do i have   
   when you re too busy swimming 
rachel  all of   
all this   
it s    it s not me  it s   
inside  i am

blonde 
come on  bruce  come on 
brunette  bruce  we have
some more hotels for you to buy 
bruce   
   deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be 
but it s not who you are underneath   
   it s what you do that defines you 
prison official 
dr  crane  thanks for coming 
not at all  he cut his wrists 
probably looking for the insanity plea 
but if anything should happen   
of course  better safe than sorry 
yeah  dr  crane  i can t take it anymore 
it s all too much 
the walls are closing in 
blah  blah  blah
