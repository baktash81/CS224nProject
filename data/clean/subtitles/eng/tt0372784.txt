finders keepers and i found it
in my garden
finders keepers
bruce
wood snapping
thud
bruce
mom mr alfred
whimpers
screaming
men screaming in distance
did you have dream
nightmare
worse than this place
guard speaking foreign
language over pa
old prisoner whispering
they are going to fight you
again
until they kill you
can they kill me before breakfast
you are in hell little man
and i am the devil
youre not the devil
youre practice
grunting
gunshots
guard
solitary
why
for protection
i dont need protection
protection for them
inmates groaning
get in
ducard are you so
desperate to fight criminals
that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time
actually there were seven of them
i counted six mr wayne
how do you know my name
the world is too small for someone
like bruce wayne to disappear
no matter how deep
he chooses to sink
who are you
my name is merely ducard
but i speak for ras al ghul
a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld
a man who can offer you a path
what makes you think i need a path
someone like you
is only here by choice
you have been exploring
the criminal fraternity
but whatever
your original intentions
you have become truly lost
and what path can ras al ghul offer
the path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil
and wishes to serve true justice
the path of the league of shadows
chuckles
youre vigilantes
no no no
a vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification
he can be destroyed or locked up
but if you make yourself more
than just a man
if you devote yourself to an ideal
and if they cant stop you
then you become
something else entirely
which is
legend mr wayne
tomorrow you will be released
if you are bored of brawling with petty thieves
and want to achieve something
there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes
pick one of these flowers
if you can carry it
to the top of the mountain
you may find what you were
looking for in the first place
and what was i looking for
only you can know that
indistinct chattering
you turn back you go back
bruce
ras al ghul
ducard
wait
speaking foreign language
translating
what are you seeking
i seek
the means to fight injustice
to turn fear
against those
who prey on the fearful
speaking foreign language
ducard translating
to manipulate the fears in others
you must first master your own
are you ready to begin
i can i can barely stand
death does not wait
for you to be ready
death is not considerate or fair
and make no mistake
here youll face death
tiger
jujitsu
panther
youre skilled but this is not a dance
and you are afraid
but not of me
tell us mr wayne
what do you fear
bats squeaking
bruce
its okay its okay
youll be okay
alfred will we be needing
an ambulance master wayne
thomas no ill set the bone
and take him for an xray later
alfred
very good sir
im very sorry sir ive told
thomas dont worry its fine
alfred took quite a fall
didnt we master bruce
thomas
and why do we fall bruce
so we can learn to pick ourselves up
just a little fall
its just a small fracture
thomas
the bats again
you know why they attacked you
dont you
they were afraid of you
afraid of me
all creatures feel fear
even the scary ones
especially the scary ones
i got something to show you
you think your mother will like them
yeah
i think its time to get up
maybe
thomas
no going back to bed
did you build this train dad
gothams been good to our family
but the citys been suffering
people less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times
so we built a new cheap public
transportation system to unite the city
and at the center
wayne tower
bruce is that where you work
no i work at the hospital
i leave the running of our company
to much better men
better
well
more interested men
performers singing
choir and orchestra
gasping
can we go
please
okay lets go
whats wrong bruce
no no it was me
i just needed some fresh air
a little bit of opera goes a long way
right bruce
come on lets go
wallet jewelry come on fast
thomas thats fine
chill fast
take it easy
take it easy
here you go
its fine its fine
now just take it and go
i said jewelry
thomas hey
gunshot
martha screaming
martha
thomas
gunshot
thomas whispering
bruce
its okay
dont be afraid
chattering
is this your fathers
its okay
come here
there you go
its okay
its okay
loeb
gordon
hey
good news
we got him son
youre in excellent hands
well be watching the empire
when you grow up
itll be waiting for you
i thought i might prepare a little supper
very well
alfred
yes master bruce
it was my fault alfred
i made them leave the theater
no no no
if i hadnt gotten scared
it was nothing that you did
it was him and him alone
do you understand
i miss them alfred
i miss them so much
so do i master bruce
so do i
ducard and do you still feel
responsible for your parents death
my anger outweighs my guilt
come
you have learned to bury
your guilt with anger
i will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth
you know how to fight six men
we can teach you how to engage 600
you know how to disappear
we can teach you
to become truly invisible
invisible
speaking in foreign language
the ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility
grunting
always mind your surroundings
ninjitsu employs explosive powders
as weapons
or distractions
theatricality and deception
are powerful agents
you must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent
man speaking
foreign language
bruce who is he
he was a farmer
then he tried to take his neighbors land
and became a murderer
now he is a prisoner
whatll happen to him
justice crime cannot be tolerated
criminals thrive on the indulgence
of societys understanding
your parents death was not your fault
it was your fathers
anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act
the man had a gun
would that stop you
ive had training
the training is nothing
will is everything
the will to act
yield
you havent beaten me
you have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke
ducard
rub your chest
your arms will take care of themselves
you are stronger than your father
you didnt know my father
but i know the rage that drives you
that impossible anger
strangling the grief
until the memory
of your loved one is just
poison in your veins
and one day you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed
so youd be spared your pain
i wasnt always here in the mountains
once i had a wife
my great love
she was taken from me
like you i was forced to learn
there are those without decency
who must be fought
without hesitation without pity
your anger gives you great power
but if you let it it will destroy you
as it almost did me
what stopped it
vengeance
thats no help to me
why bruce
why could you not
avenge your parents
will you be heading back to princeton
after the hearing sir
or can i persuade you to stay on
for a day or two
bruce
im not heading back at all
alfred you dont like it there
i like it fine
they just dont feel the same way
ive prepared the master bedroom
no
my room will be fine
alfred with all due respect sir
wayne manor is your house
bruce
no alfred its my fathers house
your father is dead
this place is a mausoleum
if i have my way ill pull
the damn thing down brick by brick
this house master wayne has sheltered
six generations of your family
why do you give a damn alfred
its not your family
i give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible
for what was most precious to him
in the whole world
miss dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing
she probably hopes
to talk you out of going
bruce should i just bury the past
out there with my parents alfred
i wouldnt presume to tell you
what to do with your past sir
just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future
havent given up on me yet
never
alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf
hasnt he noticed
youre tall enough to reach now
old habits die hard i guess
never used to stop us anyway
no it didnt
hows your mom
she misses this place
so do i
yeah
but its nothing without the people
who made it what it was
now theres only alfred
and you
im not staying rachel
youre just back for the hearing
bruce i dont suppose theres any way
to convince you not to come
someone at this proceeding
should stand for my parents
we all loved your parents bruce
what chill did is unforgivable
then why is your boss letting him go
in prison he shared a cell
with carmine falcone
he learned things and he will testify
in exchange for early parole
rachel this man killed my parents
i cannot let that pass
and i need you
to understand that please
okay
finch the depression hit working
people like mr chill hardest of all
his crime was appalling yes
but it was motivated not by greed
but by desperation
given the 14 years already served as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation
with one of this offices
most important investigations
we strongly endorse his petition
for early release
judge faden
mr chill
chill
your honor
not a day goes by that i dont wish
i could take back what i did
sure i was desperate
like a lot of people back then
but that dont change what i did
faden i gather there is a member
of the wayne family here today
has he got anything to say
woman 1 hes coming out the side
man 1 hes coming out the side guys
clamoring
man 2
bruce wayne
blonde female reporter
joe hey joe
falcone says hi
gunshot
people shouting
rachel
come on bruce
we dont need to see this
i do
rachel the da couldnt understand
why judge faden insisted
on making the hearing public
falcone paid him off
to get chill out in the open
maybe i should be thanking them
you dont mean that
what if i do rachel
my parents deserved justice
youre not talking about justice
youre talking about revenge
sometimes theyre the same
no theyre never the same bruce
justice is about harmony revenge is
about you making yourself feel better
its why we have an impartial system
your system is broken
tires screeching
and horns honking
you care about justice
look beyond your own pain bruce
this city is rotting
they talk about the depression
as if its history and its not
things are worse than ever down here
falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs
preying on the desperate
creating new joe chills every day
falcone may not have killed
your parents bruce
but hes destroying everything
that they stood for
you wanna thank him for that
here you go
we all know where to find him
as long as he keeps the bad people rich
and the good people scared
no onell touch him
good people like your parents wholl
stand against injustice theyre gone
what chance does gotham have
when the good people do nothing
im not one of your good people rachel
what do you mean
all these years i wanted to kill him
now i cant
slap
your father would be ashamed of you
youre taller than you look
in the tabloids mr wayne
no gun im insulted
you couldve just sent a thankyou note
i didnt come here to thank you
i came here to show you that
not everyone in gothams afraid of you
only those who know me kid
look around you
youll see two councilmen
a union official
couple offduty cops
and a judge
now i wouldnt have a seconds hesitation of
blowing your head off right here and right now in front of them
now thats power you cant buy
thats the power of fear
im not afraid of you
because you think you got
nothing to lose
but you havent thought it through
you havent thought about
your lady friend down the das office
you havent thought about
your old butler bang
people from your world
have so much to lose
now you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot
you know about the ugly side of life
but you dont
youve never tasted desperate
youre youre bruce wayne
the prince of gotham
youd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didnt know your name
so dont dont come down here with your anger
trying to prove something to yourself
this is a world youll never understand
and you always fear
what you dont understand
all right
yeah you got spirit kid
ill give you that
more than your old man anyway
in the joint chill told me about
the night he killed your parents
he said your father begged for mercy
begged
like a dog
shouldve tipped better
for what
your jacket
okay
hey hey hey let me have it
its a nice coat
be careful who sees you with that
theyre gonna come looking for me
who
bruce
everyone
its
its a nice coat
ducard when you lived among
the criminals did you start to pity them
bruce the first time i stole
so that i wouldn t starve yes
i lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong
and when i traveled
i learned the fear before a crime
and then the thrill of success
officer shouting in mandarin
bruce
but i never became one of them
officer 1 speaking mandarin
officer 2 fool what the hell do i care
what your name is youre a criminal
speaking mandarin
im not a criminal
officer 2
tell that to the guy who owned these
ducard youve traveled the world
to understand the criminal mind
and conquer your fears
but a criminal is not complicated
and what you really fear
is inside yourself
you fear your own power
you fear your anger
the drive to do great
or terrible things
now you must journey inwards
you are ready
breathe
breathe
breathe in your fears
face them
to conquer fear
you must become fear
you must bask in the fear
of other men
and men fear most
what they cannot see
ducard you have to become a terrible thought
ducard a wraith
you have to become an idea
ducard feel terror cloud your senses
ducard feel its power to distort
ducard to control
ducard and know that this power
can be yours
ducard embrace your worst fear
ducard become one with the darkness
bats squeaking
focus
concentrate
master your senses
you cannot leave any sign
bruce
i havent
impressive
speaking foreign language
ducard translating
we have purged your fear
you are ready to lead these men
you are ready to become a member
of the league of shadows
but first you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice
speaks foreign language
no
im no executioner
ducard your compassion is
a weakness your enemies will not share
thats why its so important
it separates us from them
you want to fight criminals
this man is a murderer
this man should be tried
ducard by whom
corrupt bureaucrats
criminals mock societys laws
you know this better than most
ras al ghul
you cannot lead these men
unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil
and where would i be leading
these men
gotham
as gothams favored son
you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality
how
gothams time has come
like constantinople or rome before it
the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice
it is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die
this is the most important function
of the league of shadows
it is one weve performed for centuries
gotham
must be destroyed
you cant believe in this
ras al ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts
what he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary
i will go back to gotham
and i will fight men like this
but i will not become an executioner
bruce please
for your own sake
there is no turning back
what are you doing
whats necessary my friend
explosions
bruce screaming
i will tell him you saved his life
master wayne
youve been gone a long time
yes i have
you look very fashionable
apart from the mud
are you coming back to gotham
for long sir
as long as it takes
i want to show the people of gotham
their city doesnt belong
to the criminals and the corrupt
in the depression your father nearly
bankrupted wayne enterprises
combating poverty
he believed that his example could inspire
the wealthy of gotham to save their city
did it
in a way
their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action
people need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy
and i cant do that as bruce wayne
as a man
im flesh and blood
i can be ignored i can be destroyed
but as a symbol
as a symbol i can be incorruptible
i can be everlasting
what symbol
something elemental
something terrifying
i assume that as you are taking on
the underworld
this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals
youre thinking about rachel
actually sir i was thinking of myself
have you told anyone im coming back
i just couldnt figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead
dead
youve been gone seven years
you had me declared dead
actually it was mr earle
hes taking the company public
he wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding
those shares are worth
quite a bit of money
well its a good thing
i left everything to you then
quite so sir
and you can borrow the rolls if you like
just bring it back with a full tank
in my opinion mr zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others
and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation
dr crane
ah miss dawes
you really think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesnt belong in jail
i would hardly have testified to that
otherwise would i miss dawes
this is the third of carmine falcones thugs
youve had declared insane
and moved into your asylum
the work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane
rachel dawes or the corrupt
mr finch
i think you should check
with miss dawes here
just what implications your office
has authorized her to make if any
what are you doing rachel
what are you doing carl
finch
looking out for you
falcone has half the city
bought and paid for
drop it
how can you say that
because as much as i care about
getting falcone i care more about you
thats sweet
sirens wailing
weve been through all that
bat squeaking
alfred
blessed bat again sir
they nest somewhere in the grounds
bats squeaking
crane no more favors
someone is sniffing around
hey i scratch your back
you scratch mine doc
im bringing in the shipments
we are paying you for that
maybe money isnt as interesting
to me as favors
i am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me mr falcone
but you know who im working for
and when he gets here
he hes coming to gotham
yes he is
and when he gets here
hes not going to wanna hear
that youve endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of a little jail time
whos bothering you
theres a girl at the das office
well buy her off
not this one
idealist huh
well theres an answer to that too
i dont want to know
yes you do
board director no we are showing
very healthy growth in these sectors
i dont think that thomas wayne would have
viewed heavyarms manufacture
as a suitable cornerstone
for our business
well thats 20 years ago fredericks
i think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves
to stop thinking about what
thomas wayne would have done
jessica
good morning mr earles office
yes hes confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening
bruce good morning
im here to see mr earle
name
bruce wayne
thomas would probably not
have taken the company public
but that is what we
as responsible managers are going to do
jessica
jessica where are you
bruce eye on the ball and
why is no one answering the phone
its wayne enterprises mr earle
im sure theyll call back
bruce youre supposed to be dead
sorry to disappoint
i need you to take a look at this
have you seen him yet
who
wayne
its been all over the news
hes back
earle im sure you realize
i cant stop the big machine
too many wheels turning
were going public
i understand
and ill be handsomely rewarded
for my shares
im not looking to interfere
i am looking for a job
oh
i just want to get to know the company
that my family built
any ideas where you would start
applied sciences caught my eye
foxs department
ill let him know youre coming
you look like him your dad
youre the only one left
of the wayne family
this is where you belong
welcome home
lucius fox environmental procedures
defense projects
consumer products
all prototypes none in production
on any level whatsoever
none
what did they tell you this place was
bruce
they didnt tell me anything
earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here
dead end
a place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble
come on
you were on the board
when your father ran things yeah
you knew my father
oh yeah
helped him build his train
here we are
kevlar utility harness
gaspowered magnetic grapple gun
the 350pound test monofilament
wonderful project your dads train
routed it right into wayne tower
along with the water and power utilities
kind of made wayne tower
the unofficial center of gotham city
of course earle let it go to rot
here we are
nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry
kevlar biweave reinforced joints
tearresistant
this sucker will stop a knife
bulletproof
anything but a straight shot
why didnt they put it into production
bean counters didnt think
a soldiers life was worth 300 grand
so whats your interest in it
mr wayne
i want to borrow it
for spelunking
spelunking
yeah you know cave diving
you expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves
look id rather mr earle
didnt know about me borrowing
mr wayne
the way i see it
all this stuff is yours anyway
okay give it a try
charming
at least youll have company
this must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing
in the civil war your greatgreatgrandfather
was involved in the underground railroad
secretly transporting freed slaves
to the north
and i suspect these caverns
came in handy
alfred come up here
i can see everything all right
from down here sir thank you very much
alfred we order the main part
of this cowl from singapore
bruce
via a dummy corporation
indeed and then quite separately
we place an order
to a chinese company for these
bruce put it together ourselves
alfred precisely
theyll have to be large orders
to avoid suspicion
bruce how large
alfred say 10000
bruce well at least well have spares
alfred yes
sirens wailing
inaudible dialogue
female officer chattering
over police radio
dont suppose you want a taste
i just keep offering
thinking maybe someday youll get wise
theres nothing wise
in what you do flass
well jimbo you dont take the taste
makes us guys nervous
im no rat
in a town this bent
whos there to rat to anyway
laughs
batman
dont turn around
youre a good cop
one of the few
gordon
what do you want
batman carmine falcone brings
in shipments of drugs every week
nobody takes him down why
hes paid up with the right people
what will it take to bring him down
leverage on judge faden
and a da brave enough
to prosecute
rachel dawes
who are you
batman
watch for my sign
youre just one man
batman
now were two
we
freeze
gunshots
officer
what the hell was that
just some nut
well what is it today
more spelunking
no today its basejumping
basejumping
that like parachuting
kind of
do you have any lightweight fabrics
you know i think i have just the thing
its called memory cloth
notice anything
regularly flexible
but put a current through it
molecules realign it becomes rigid
what kind of shapes can you make
can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton
too expensive for the army
i dont think they ever tried to market it
to the billionaire spelunking basejumping crowd
look mr fox
yes sir
if youre uncomfortable
mr wayne if you dont want to tell me
exactly what youre doing
when im asked i dont have to lie
but dont think of me as an idiot
fair enough
whats that
the tumbler
oh you wouldnt be interested in that
she was built as a bridging vehicle
during combat two of these
would jump over a river towing cables
over here on the throttle
flip that open and throttle up
this will boost you into a rampless jump
not now
not not now sir
computer
afterburner disengaged
we never could get
the damn bridge to work
but this baby works just fine
so what do you think
does it come in black
i need you at the docks thursday
problems
i dont want any trouble
with the last shipment
sure
word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the das office
is that right
and that theres a fat prize
waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it
so whats your point mr flass
have you seen the girl
flass on radio
its a cute little assistant d a
don t you think thats a little too much
heat to bring down maybe
even for this town
never underestimate gotham city
people get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week
sometimes
sometimes things just go bad
its a problem with the graphite sir
the next 10000
will be up to specifications
at least they gave us a discount
quite
in the meantime sir may i suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head
why bats master wayne
bats frighten me
its time my enemies shared my dread
flass
what is it
continue
looks fine out there
flass
the bears go straight to the dealers
yeah and the rabbits go
to the man in the narrows
whats the difference
ignorance is bliss my friend
dont burden yourself
with these secrets of scary people
steiss screams
hey steiss
steiss
thug
what
what the
screaming in distance
gunshots
i better check it
panting
theres a problem out here
you better bail
thud
shouting where are you
batman whispering here
screams
grunting
take a ride oh shit
what the hell are you
glass shatters
im batman
nice coat
thanks
hold it
thats right you better run
screams
electricity crackling
falcone sent them to kill you
why
you rattled his cage
whats this
leverage
for what
to get things moving
who are you
someone like you
someone wholl rattle the cages
maam everything okay
officer falcones men
gordon does it matter
well never tie him to it anyway
i wouldnt be too sure of that
what the hell is that
cut him down
loeb
unacceptable
now i dont care if its rival gangs
guardian angels
or the goddamn salvation army
get them off the street
and off the front page
they say it was just one guy
or a creature
it was some asshole in a costume
yeah
this guy did deliver us
one of the citys biggest crime lords
no one takes the law
into their own hands in my city
understand
rachel no way to bury it now
finch maybe so but theres still judge faden
ive got faden covered
ok what about this bat they babble about
even if these guys will swear in court
to being thrashed by a giant bat
weve got falcone at the scene
drugs prints cargo manifests
this bat character gave us everything
okay lets do it
bruce bats are nocturnal
alfred bats may be
but even for billionaire playboys
3 oclock is pushing it
the price for leading a double life
i fear
your theatrics made an impression
bruce
theatricality and deception
are powerful weapons alfred
this is a good start
if those are to be the first
of many injuries to come
it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse
polo for instance
im not learning polo alfred
strange injuries
a nonexistent social life
these things beg the question
as to what exactly does bruce wayne
do with his time and his money
what does someone like me do
drive sports cars date movie stars
buy things that are not for sale
who knows master wayne
you start pretending to have fun
you might even have a little
by accident
board director
sir
we have a situation
all right
the coast guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night
heavily damaged all crew missing
probably dead
the ship was carrying
a prototype weapon
its a microwave emitter
its designed for desert warfare but it
it looks like somebody
turned it on
it uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemys water supply
the damage to the ship
was catastrophic
the weapon itself is
missing
yeah
man
mr wayne
nice car
you should see my other one
female guest hes done something
the police have never done
male guest you cant take the law
into your own hands
well at least hes getting
something done
male guest bruce help me out here
huh
well a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues
but hes put falcone behind bars
male guest now the cops want to bring him in
so what does that tell you
theyre jealous
sir the pool is for decoration
and your friends
do not have swimwear
well theyre european
im going to have to ask you to leave
it is not a question of money
well you see
im buying this hotel
and setting some new rules
about the pool area
i think the batman deserves a medal
and a straitjacket to pin it on
doorman
thank you
bruce
rachel
id heard you were back
what are you doing
just swimming here
wow it is good to see you
you were gone a long time
i know how are things
the same
jobs getting worse
cant change the world on your own
what choice do i have
when youre too busy swimming
rachel all of
all this
its its not me its
inside i am
i am more
blonde
come on bruce come on
brunette bruce we have
some more hotels for you to buy
bruce
deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be
but its not who you are underneath
