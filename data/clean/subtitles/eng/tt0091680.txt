to the fact that love was blind
now if love is blind
he thought to himself
how will it find me
lt honestly seems such a crime
for how many times
has love knocked on the door
when it should have been
knocking on mine
and so one day he went off
in search of the aloof creature
he soon happened upon
the cute and fuzzy bunny gang
perhaps they could help him
pardon me cute and fuzzy bunnies
he said
l wonder if you could help me find love
love would have nothing to do
with such a stupidlooking creature
said the first cute and fuzzy bunny
with that nose and those shoes
and that stomach
and those eyes
and those ears
roses are red violets are blue
but love will have
nothing to do with you
they chanted and danced around him
naturally our hero
was very saddened by this so
he
actually he
he reached into his suitcase
and pulled out an lsraeli submachine gun
and he sawed those
cute fuzzy bastards in half
with hot lead
lt was beautiful
wait stop no no
its supposed to be a love story
not a rambo bloodbath
forget it its not your fault its me
morty how am i going to get this done
what do you know
youre not a man youre a cat
go back to your feline world
get out of here

i know that she knows
im not irresponsible
your mother still has faith in you hoops
just because you cant
play basketball worth a shit
doesnt mean
you got no other option in life
i guess youre right

than being surprised
with your brandnew graduation wheels
that final parental confirmation
that youre going somewhere in life
and this is just the vehicle
to take you there
nantucket when can we leave

into the cold dark sea
and he never found love

egg
egg
egg im about to teach you
a very valuable lesson
in an emergency situation
the victims cannot
and must not be allowed
to think for themselves
the shock and the horror
of what just happened
will surely impair their judgment
you must do the thinking
in order to save them
in this case
a plane has just crashlanded on this point
now there are going to be
bodies everywhere
just gushing blood and
their faces will be
pulled off of their heads and
armpits will be hanging from trees
their eyeballs will be
sticking out of their heads
youll have to push them back in
with a stick or something
now remember
you are the only thing
that will stand between life and death
lets do it
come on lets go hurry up
dad i really wish we could discuss this
