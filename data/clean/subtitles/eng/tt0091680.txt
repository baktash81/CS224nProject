to the fact that love was blind 
 now  if love is blind   
he thought to himself   
 how will it find me 
 lt honestly seems such a crime 
 for how many times
has love knocked on the door   
 when it should have been
knocking on mine  
and so one day  he went off
in search of the aloof creature 
he soon happened upon
the cute and fuzzy bunny gang 
perhaps they could help him 
 pardon me  cute and fuzzy bunnies   
he said 
 l wonder if you could help me find love   
 love would have nothing to do   
 with such a stupid looking creature   
said the first cute and fuzzy bunny 
 with that nose  and those shoes   
 and that stomach   
 and those eyes   
 and those ears   
 roses are red  violets are blue   
 but love will have
nothing to do with you   
they chanted and danced around him 
naturally  our hero
was very saddened by this  so   
he    
actually  he    
he reached into his suitcase   
and pulled out an lsraeli submachine gun   
and he sawed those
cute  fuzzy bastards in half   
with hot lead 
lt was beautiful 
wait  stop  no  no 
it s supposed to be a love story
not a rambo bloodbath 
forget it  it s not your fault  it s me 
morty  how am i going to get this done 
what do you know 
you re not a man  you re a cat 
go back to your feline world 
get out of here 
you better move it  hoops

i got to buckle down 
i ve got two weeks to submit
my scholarship assignment 
it s my only chance to get into
rhode island school of design

the assignment is supposed to be
an illustrated love story 
what do i know about love 
i ve never been in love 
l would like to congratulate
the 1986 graduating class   
of generic new york high school 
i think what you really need
is a break from your mom 
you re gonna end up
being a street cleaner   
because you didn t get
your basketball scholarship 
 i guess she s taking it hard 
 of course she is 
it s like my mom saying
i m an irresponsible louse 
i know that she knows
i m not irresponsible 
your mother still has faith in you  hoops 
just because you can t
play basketball worth a shit   
doesn t mean
you got no other option in life 
 i guess you re right 
 there you go 
nothing proves that more
than being surprised   
with your brand new graduation wheels 
that final  parental confirmation
that you re going somewhere in life 
and this is just the vehicle
to take you there 
nantucket  when can we leave 
just got to pick up my sister 
and  hoops  remember   
never say anything about her dog 
bye bye  have a nice summer

i want you to die 
once upon a time 
there was a lonely guy   
on a quest for love 
the cute  fuzzy bunnies
were quick to cooperate this time 
the path they sent him on
landed him on an ocean going vessel 
our hero hated boats 
but he was desperate on his quest   
and once again he fell victim
to the heinous cute and fuzzy bunnies 
and he was sucked
into the cold  dark sea   
and he never found love

egg 
egg 
egg  i m about to teach you   
a very valuable lesson 
in an emergency situation   
the victims cannot
and must not be allowed   
to think for themselves 
the shock and the horror
of what just happened   
will surely impair their judgment 
you must do the thinking
in order to save them 
in this case   
a plane has just crash landed on this point 
now  there are going to be
bodies everywhere   
just gushing blood and   
their faces will be
pulled off of their heads and   
armpits will be hanging from trees 
their eyeballs will be
sticking out of their heads 
you ll have to push them back in
with a stick or something 
now  remember   
you are the only thing   
that will stand between life and death 
let s do it 
come on  let s go  hurry up 
dad  i really wish we could discuss this
