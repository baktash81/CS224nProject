when the battle s lost and won 
where the place 
upon the battlefield 
there to meet with macbeth 
fair is foul  and foul is fair 
hover through the fog and filthy air 
doubtful it stood  as two spent
swimmers that do cling together
and choke their art 
 the merciless macdonwald
from the western isles
 of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied  
and fortune 
on his damned quarrel smiling 
showed like a rebel s whore 
but all s too weak  for brave macbeth   
well he deserves that name   
disdaining fortune 
with his brandished steel
which smoked with bloody execution 
like valour s minion
carved out his passage
till he faced the slave
which ne er shook hands
nor bade farewell to him
till he unseamed him
from the nave to the chops
and fixed his head upon our battlements 
and  to conclude 
victory fell on us 
valiant macbeth 
worthy gentleman 
great happiness 
whence cam st thou  noble prince 
from fife  great king 
where norwegian banners flout the sky
and fan our people cold 
assisted by that most disloyal traitor 
the thane of cawdor 
god save the king 
no more that thane of cawdor
shall deceive our bosom interest 
go pronounce his present death
and with his former title greet macbeth 
i ll see it done 
what he hath lost  noble macbeth hath won 
so foul and fair a day i have not seen 
what are these 
live you or are you aught
that man may question 
speak  if you can  what are you 
macbeth  hail to thee  thane of glamis 
macbeth  hail to thee  thane of cawdor 
all hail  macbeth 
that shalt be king hereafter 
good sir 
why do you start and seem to fear
things that do sound so fair 
my noble partner
you greet with present grace
and great prediction
of noble having and of royal hope
that he seems rapt withal 
to me you speak not 
hail  lesser than macbeth and greater 
not so happy yet much happier 
thou shalt get kings though thou be none 
so all hail  macbeth and banquo 
 banquo and macbeth 
 all hail  
stay  you imperfect speakers 
tell me more 
say from whence you owe
this strange intelligence
and why  upon this blasted heath 
you stop our way
with such prophetic greeting 
speak  i charge you 
the earth hath bubbles as the water has 
and these are of them 
whither are they vanished 
into the air 
and what seemed corporal
melted as breath into the wind 
would they had stayed 
were such things here
as we do speak about 
or have we eaten on the insane root
that takes the reason prisoner 
your children shall be kings 
you shall be king 
and thane of cawdor too  went it not so 
to the selfsame tune and words 
the king hath happily received  macbeth 
the news of thy success 
as thick as hail came post from post
and every one did bear thy praises 
in his kingdom s great defence 
and poured them down before him 
and we are sent to give thee
from our royal master thanks 
and  for an earnest of a greater honour 
he bade me from him
call thee thane of cawdor 
the thane of cawdor lives 
why do you dress me in borrowed robes 
treasons capital  confessed and proved 
have overthrown him 
do you not hope
your children shall be kings
when those that gave
the thane of cawdor to me
promised no less to them 
that trusted home might yet
enkindle you unto the crown
besides the thane of cawdor 
but  tis strange 
and oftentimes  to win us to our harm 
the instruments of darkness
tell us truths 
win us with honest trifles
to betray s in deepest consequence 
this supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill 
cannot be good 
if ill  why hath it given me
earnest of success 
commencing in a truth 
i am thane of cawdor 
if good  why do i yield to that suggestion
whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
and make my seated heart knock at my ribs
against the use of nature 
present fears are less
than horrible imaginings 
if chance will have me king 
why  chance may crown me without my stir 
hail  macbeth 
o worthiest cousin 
more is thy due
than more than all can pay 
the service and the loyalty i owe
in doing it pays itself 
from hence to inverness 
and bind us further to you 
i ll be myself the harbinger
and make joyful the hearing of my wife
with your approach 
so humbly take my leave 
my worthy cawdor 
 they met me in the day of success
 and i have learned
by the perfect st report
 they have more in them
than mortal knowledge 
 when i burned in desire
to question them further 
 they made themselves air
into which they vanished 
 whiles i stood rapt in the wonder of it
came missives from the king
 who all hailed me
 thane of cawdor 
 by which title before
these weird sisters saluted me
 and referred me
to the coming on of time with 
  hail  king that shalt be   
come 
you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts 
unsex me here
and fill me from the crown to the toe
top full of direst cruelty 
come to my woman s breasts
and take my milk for gall 
you murthering ministers 
wherever  in your sightless substances 
you wait on nature s mischief 
come  thick night 
and pall thee
in the dunnest smoke of hell 
that my keen knife see not
the wound it makes 
nor heaven peep
through the blanket of the dark
to cry   hold  hold  
hie thee hither
that i may pour my spirits in thine ear
and chastise with the valour of my tongue
all that impedes thee
from the golden round 
thy letters have transported me
beyond this ignorant present
and i feel now the future in the instant 
my dearest love 
duncan comes here tonight 
and when goes hence 
tomorrow  as he purposes 
o never shall sun that morrow see 
glamis thou art  and cawdor 
and shalt be what thou art promised 
yet i do fear thy nature 
it is too full o  the milk
of human kindness
to catch the nearest way 
thou wouldst be great 
art not without ambition
but without the illness should attend it 
to beguile the time  look like the time 
bear welcome in your eye 
your hand  your tongue 
look like the innocent flower
but be the serpent under t 
he that s coming must be provided for
and you shall put this night s
great business into my dispatch
which shall 
to all our nights and days to come 
give solely sovereign sway and masterdom 
we will speak further 
all our service  in every point
twice done and then done double 
give me your hand 
conduct me to mine host 
we love him highly and shall continue
our graces towards him 
by your leave  hostess 
my plenteous   
up 
up 
my plenteous joys 
wanton in fulness 
seek to hide themselves
in drops of sorrow 
sons 
kinsmen 
thanes 
and you whose places are the nearest 
know that we will establish our estate
upon our eldest  malcolm 
whom we name hereafter
the prince of cumberland 
 the prince of cumberland 
 that is a step on which i must fall down 
or else o erleap 
 for in my way it lies  
if it were done when  tis done 
then  twere well it were done quickly 
if the assassination
could trammel up the consequence
and catch with his surcease success 
that but this blow might be
the be all and end all here 
but here upon this bank and shoal of time
we d jump the life to come 
does anybody know what this is 
but in these cases we still
have judgement here 
that we but teach bloody instructions
which return to plague the inventor 
this even handed justice commends
the ingredience of our poisoned chalice
to our own lips 
he s here in double trust 
first  as i am
his kinsman and his subject 
strong both against the deed 
then  as his host  who should
against his murderer shut the door 
not bear the knife myself 
besides  this duncan
hath borne his faculties so meek 
hath been so clear in his great office 
that his virtues would plead like angels 
trumpet tongued against
the deep damnation of his taking off 
i have no spur
to prick the sides of my intent
but only vaulting ambition
which o erleaps itself
and falls on the other 
we will proceed no further
in this business 
was the hope drunk
wherein you dressed yourself 
hath it slept since 
and wakes it now to look so green and pale
at what it did so freely 
from this time
such i account thy love 
art thou afeard to be the same
in thine own act and valour
as thou art in desire 
wouldst thou have that
which thou esteem st the ornament of life
and live a coward in thy own esteem 
letting  i dare not  wait upon  i would  
prithee  peace 
i dare do all that may become a man 
who dares do more is none 
what beast was t  then 
that made you break this enterprise to me 
when you durst do it  then you were a man 
and to be more than what you were 
you would be so much more the man 
i have given suck
and know how tender  tis
to love the babe that milks me 
i would  while it was smiling in my face 
have plucked my nipple
from his boneless gums
and dashed the brains out
had i so sworn  as you have done  to this 
if we should fail 
we fail 
but screw your courage
to the sticking place
and we ll not fail 
when duncan is asleep
his two chamberlains will i
with wine and wassail so convince
that memory  the warder of the brain 
shall be a fume
and the receipt of reason a limbeck only 
when in swinish sleep
their drenched natures lie as in a death
what cannot you and i perform
upon the unguarded duncan 
what not put upon his spongy officers
who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell 
i am settled
and bend up each corporal agent
to this terrible feat 
take my sword 
take thee that too 
a heavy summons lies like lead upon me
and yet i would not sleep 
merciful powers 
restrain in me the cursed thoughts
that nature gives way to in repose 
is this a dagger which i see before me 
the handle toward my hand 
come 
let me clutch thee 
art thou not  fatal vision 
sensible to feeling as to sight 
or art thou but a dagger of the mind 
a false creation  proceeding
from the heat oppressed brain 
thou marshall st me
the way that i was going
and such an instrument i was to use 
mine eyes are made the fools
o  the other senses 
or else worth all the rest 
i see thee still 
there s no such thing 
it is the bloody business
which informs thus to mine eyes 
now  o er the one half world 
nature seems dead
and wicked dreams abuse
the curtained sleep 
witchcraft celebrates
and withered murder moves like a ghost 
i see thee yet 
in form as palpable
as this which now i draw 
whiles i threat  he lives 
words to the heat of deeds
too cold breath gives 
the spring 
the head 
the fountain of your blood is stopped 
the very source of it is stopped 
here lies duncan 
his silver skin laced
with his golden blood 
there the murderers 
steeped in the colours of their trade 
had i but died an hour before this chance 
i had lived a blessed time 
but from this instant
there s nothing serious in mortality 
all is but toys 
renown and grace is dead 
the wine of life is drawn
and the mere lees is left
this vault to brag of 
live you 
or are you aught that man may question 
i have done the deed 
why did you bring these daggers
from the place 
they must lie there 
what hands are here 
 they pluck out mine eyes  
will all great neptune s ocean
wash this blood clean from my hand 
no 
this my hand will rather
the multitudinous seas incarnadine 
making the green one red 
my hands are of your colour 
but i shame to wear a heart so white 
a little water clears us of this deed 
how easy is it then 
to know my deed
 twere best not know myself 
good macduff 
good morrow  noble sir 
good morrow  both 
is the king stirring  worthy thane 
  the king  is he stirring 
  not yet 
he did command me to call timely on him 
i have almost slipped the hour 
i ll bring you to him 
i ll make so bold to call 
  goes the king hence today 
  he does  he did appoint so 
the night has been unruly 
where we lay  our temples were blown down
and  as they say 
lamentings heard in the air 
strange screams of death 
 twas a rough night 
confusion now hath made his masterpiece 
most sacrilegious murder hath broke open
the lord s anointed temple
and stole thence the life of the building 
the life 
mean you his majesty 
bid me not speak  you see 
speak yourselves 
awake 
awake 
ring the alarum bells 
malcolm 
malcolm 
banquo 
ring the alarum bells 
banquo 
shake off your downy sleep  man 
death s counterfeit 
you come and look on death itself 
huh 
murder 
treason 
what s the business 
our royal master  he s murdered 
  murdered 
  murdered 
those of his chamber 
their hands were all badged with blood 
wherefore did you so 
hm 
who could refrain that had a heart to love
and in that heart
courage to make love known 
how it does grieve macbeth 
did he not straight  in pious rage 
the two delinquents tear
that were the slaves of drink 
was this not nobly done 
ay 
 twould have angered any heart alive
to hear the men deny it 
i say he has borne all things well 
is t known who did
this more than bloody deed 
those that macbeth hath slain 
alas  the day 
what good could they pretend 
malcolm  the king s son 
is stolen away and fled 
which puts upon him suspicion of the deed 
 tis most like the sovereignty
will fall upon macbeth 
he is already named 
 thou hast it now 
 king  cawdor 
 glamis 
 all as the weird women promised 
 and i fear
thou playedst most foully for t 
 yet it was said
it should not stand in thy posterity  
but that myself should be
the root and father of many kings 
if there come truth from them 
why  by the verities on thee made good 
may they not be my oracles as well
and set me up in hope 
but hush 
no more 
hail  macbeth 
hail  macbeth  hail  macbeth 
hail  macbeth 
hail  macbeth 
 to be thus    is nothing 
 but to be safely thus 
 our fears in banquo stick deep  
and in his royalty of nature
reigns that which would be feared 
 tis much he dares
and to that dauntless temper
of his mind   
   he hath a wisdom
that doth guide his valour 
how now  my lord  why do you keep alone 
we have scorched the snake  not killed it 
she ll close and be herself
whilst our poor malice remains
in danger of her former tooth 
things without all remedy
should be without regard 
what s done is done 
come  gentle my lord 
sleek o er your rugged looks 
be bright and jovial
among your guests tonight 
thou know st that banquo 
and his fleance  lives 
you must leave this 
he chid the sisters
when first they put
the name of king upon me
and bade them speak to him 
then  prophet like 
they hailed him father to a line of kings 
upon my head
they placed a fruitless crown
and put a barren sceptre in my grip 
thence to be wrenched
with an unlineal hand 
no son of mine succeeding 
if it be so 
for banquo s issue have i filed my mind 
for them
the gracious duncan have i murdered 
put rancours in the vessel of my peace
only for them 
to make them kings 
the seed of banquo kings 
what s to be done 
be innocent of the knowledge 
dearest chuck 
till thou applaud the deed 
full  full of scorpions  is my mind 
thou marvell st at my words 
hold thee still 
things bad begun
make themselves strong by ill 
come  seeling night 
scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
and  with thy bloody and invisible hand 
cancel   
and tear to pieces that great bond
which keeps me pale 
get up 
tonight we hold a solemn supper  sir 
and i ll request your presence 
let your highness command upon me
to the which my duties are 
with a most indissoluble tie 
forever knit 
ride you this afternoon 
ay  my good lord 
we should have else desired
your good advice in this day s council 
but we ll take tomorrow 
is t far you ride 
as far  my lord  as will fill up the time
 twixt this and supper 
go not my horse the better 
fail not our feast 
my lord  i will not 
we hear our bloody cousin
is bestowed in england 
not confessing his cruel parricide 
filling his hearers with strange invention 
but of that tomorrow 
hie you to horse 
adieu  till you return at night 
goes fleance with you 
ay  my good lord 
our time does call upon s 
farewell 
within this hour  at most 
i will advise you
where to plant yourselves 
acquaint you with the perfect spy
o  the time the moment on t 
for it must be done tonight 
and something from the palace 
always thought that i require a clearness 
and with him 
to leave no rubs nor botches in the work 
fleance  his son that keeps him company 
whose absence is no less material to me
than is his father s 
must embrace the fate of that dark hour 
fly 
fly  fleance  fly 
hail  macbeth  hail  macbeth 
hail  macbeth 
you know your own degrees 
sit down  at first and last 
the hearty welcome 
our hostess keeps her state
but in best time
we will require her welcome 
pronounce it for me  sir 
to all our friends 
for my heart speaks they are welcome 
your majesty 
be large in mirth  anon 
we ll drink a measure the table round 
there s blood upon thy face 
 tis banquo s then 
is he dispatched 
my lord  his throat is cut 
he s good that did the like for fleance 
if thou didst it  thou art the nonpareil 
most royal sir  fleance is scaped 
then comes my fit again 
i had else been perfect 
whole as the marble  founded as the rock 
as broad and general as the casing air 
but now i am cabined  cribbed  confined 
bound in to saucy doubts and fears 
my royal lord  you do not give the cheer 
thanks for that 
sweet remembrancer 
now  good digestion wait on appetite
and health on both 
here had we now
our country s honour roofed 
were the graced person
of our banquo present 
who may i rather challenge for unkindness
than pity for mischance 
his absence  sir 
lays blame upon his promise 
what is t that moves your highness 
  which of you have done this 
  what  my good lord 
thou canst not say that i did it 
his highness is not well 
sit  worthy friends 
pray you  keep seat 
the fit is momentary 
upon a thought he will again be well 
if much you note him  you shall offend him
and extend his passion 
feed and regard him not 
are you a man 
ay  and a bold one that dare look on that
which might appal the devil 
o proper stuff 
prithee  see there 
behold 
look  lo  how say you 
this is the very painting of your fear 
this is the air drawn dagger
which you said led you to duncan 
why do you make such faces 
if i stand here  i saw him 
my worthy lord 
your noble friends do lack you 
blood hath been shed ere now 
in the olden time 
the time has been that 
when the brains were out 
the man would die
and there an end 
but now they rise again
and push us from our stools 
this is more strange
than such a murder is 
i do forget 
come 
love and health to all 
our duties and the pledge 
avaunt and quit my sight 
let the earth hide thee 
thy bones are marrowless 
thy blood is cold 
thou hast no speculation in those eyes 
which thou dost glare with 
think of this  good peers   
   but as a thing of custom 
 tis no other 
i pray you  sit still 
you make me strange 
even to the disposition that i owe
when now i think
you can behold such sights
and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
when mine is blanched with fear 
  what sights  my lord 
  i pray you  speak not 
he grows worse and worse 
question enrages him 
stand not upon the order of your going
but go at once 
good night 
and better health attend his majesty 
a kind good night to all 
it will have blood 
they say blood will have blood 
what is the night 
almost at odds with morning 
which is which 
how say st thou
that macduff denies his person
at our great bidding 
you lack the season of all natures 
sleep 
 i will to the weird sisters 
 more shall they speak 
 for now i am bent to know
by the worst means the worst 
 for mine own good 
all causes shall give way 
 i am in blood stepped in so far that 
should i wade no more 
 returning were as tedious as go o er 
 strange things i have in head
that will to hand 
 which must be acted
ere they may be scanned  
i conjure you  by that which you profess 
howe er you come to know it 
answer me 
speak  i charge you 
be lion mettled  proud 
and take no care who chafes 
who frets  or where conspirers are 
macbeth shall never vanquished be 
until great birnam wood
to high dunsinane hill
shall come against him 
beware macduff 
beware the thane of fife 
dismiss me  enough 
  beware macduff 
  beware macduff 
  beware the thane of fife 
  beware macduff 
beware the thane of fife 
  beware the thane of fife 
  beware macduff 
beware the thane of fife 
be bloody 
bold  and resolute 
laugh to scorn the power of man 
for none of woman born shall harm macbeth 
then live  macduff 
what need i fear of thee 
but yet i ll make assurance double sure
and take a bond of fate 
thou shalt not live 
saw you the weird sisters 
no  my lord 
came they not by you 
no  indeed  my lord 
infected be the air whereon they ride
and damned all those that trust them 
 who was t came by  
 tis two or three  my lord 
that bring you word 
macduff has fled to england 
  fled to england 
  ay  my good lord 
the flighty purpose never is overtook
unless the deed go with it 
the very firstlings of my heart
shall be the firstlings of my hand 
be it thought and done 
hell is murky 
what s done cannot be undone 
skirr the country round 
hang those that talk of fear 
the castle of macduff i will surprise 
seize upon fife 
give to the edge of the sword
his wife  his babes 
and all unfortunate souls
that trace him in his line 
no boasting like a fool 
this deed i ll do
before this purpose cool 
murder 
murder 
murder 
i have done no harm 
i have done no harm 
murder 
murder 
no 
no  please  my babies 
no 
bring me no more reports 
let them fly all 
till birnam wood remove to dunsinane
i cannot taint with fear 
what s the boy malcolm 
was he not born of woman 
the spirits that know
all mortal consequence
have pronounced me thus 
 fear not  macbeth 
 no man that s born of woman
shall e er have power upon thee  
then fly  false thanes 
and mingle with the english epicures 
why are you silent 
this tyrant 
whose sole name blisters our tongues 
was once thought honest 
now is the time of help 
your eye in scotland
would create soldiers 
make our women fight
to doff their dire distresses 
be it their comfort we are coming thither 
i have words
that would be howled in the desert air
where hearing should not latch them 
my ever gentle cousin 
stands scotland where it did 
alas  poor country 
it s almost afraid to know itself 
it cannot be called our mother
but our graves 
what s our newest grief 
let not your ears despise my tongue
which shall possess them
with the heaviest sound
that ever yet they heard 
how does my wife 
your castle is surprised 
your wife and babes savagely slaughtered 
what man  hm 
what man 
my children too 
wife  children  servants 
all that could be found 
he has no children 
all my pretty chickens
and their dam 
in one fell swoop 
dispute it like a man 
oh   
oh  i will do so 
but i will also feel it as a man 
sinful macduff 
they were all struck for thee 
be this the whetstone of your sword 
let grief convert to anger 
blunt not the heart  enrage it 
gracious england hath lent us
ten thousand men 
our power is ready 
our lack is nothing but our leave 
front to front
you bring thou
this fiend of scotland and myself 
and within my sword s length you set him 
if he scape 
heaven forgive him too 
 great dunsinane he strongly fortifies 
 some say he s mad 
 others  lesser  that hate him
 do call it valiant fury  
but  for certain 
he cannot buckle his distempered cause
within the belt of rule 
those he commands
move only in command 
 nothing in love 
 now does he feel
 his secret murders
sticking on his hands  
yet here s a spot 
out  damned spot 
out  i say 
hell is murky 
fie  my lord 
fie 
a soldier and afeard 
what need we fear who knows it
when none can call our power to account 
yet who would have thought
the old man to have had
so much blood in him 
the thane of fife had a wife 
where is she now 
what 
will these hands ne er be clean 
no more o  that  my lord 
no more o  that 
you mar all with this starting 
here s the smell of the blood still 
all the perfumes of arabia
will not sweeten this little hand 
wash your hands 
put on your nightgown 
look not so pale 
to bed 
to bed 
there s knocking at the gate 
come 
come 
come  come  give me your hand 
what s done cannot be undone 
to bed 
to bed 
to bed 
to bed 
to bed 
to bed 
the devil damn thee black 
thou cream faced loon 
where got st thou that goose look 
there s ten thousand 
geese  villain 
soldiers  sir 
go  prick thy face and over red thy fear 
thou lily livered boy 
what soldiers  patch 
the english force  so please you 
hang out our banners on the outward walls 
the cry is still   they come  
our castle s strength
will laugh a siege to scorn 
here let them lie
till famine and the ague eat them up 
doctor 
the thanes fly from me 
what rhubarb  cyme or what purgative drug
would scour these english hence 
hear st thou of them 
ay  my good lord 
your royal preparation
makes us hear something 
if thou couldst  doctor 
cast the water of my land 
find her disease
and purge it
to a sound and pristine health 
i would applaud thee to the very echo
that should applaud again 
the queen  my lord  is dead 
she should have died hereafter 
there would have been a time
for such a word 
tomorrow 
and tomorrow 
and tomorrow
creeps in this petty pace from day to day
to the last syllable of recorded time 
and all our yesterdays have lighted fools
the way to dusty death 
out 
out  brief candle 
life s but a walking shadow 
a poor player
that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage
and then is heard no more 
it is a tale told by an idiot 
full of sound and fury 
signifying nothing 
what is that noise 
it is the cry of women  my good lord 
i have almost forgot the taste of fears 
the time has been
my senses would have cooled
to hear a night shriek
and my fell of hair
would  at a dismal treatise 
rouse and stir
as life were in t 
i have supped full with horrors 
direness  familiar
to my slaughterous thoughts 
cannot once start me 
thy story  quickly 
gracious my lord 
i should report that which i say i saw 
but know not how to do it 
seyton 
i am sick at heart when i behold 
seyton  i say 
this push will chair me ever
or dis seat me now 
i have lived long enough 
my way of life is fallen into the sere 
the yellow leaf 
and that which should
accompany old age as   
   honour 
love 
obedience 
troops of friends 
i must not look to have 
but  in their stead 
curses 
not loud 
but deep  mouth honour  breath 
which the poor heart would fain deny
and dare not 
seyton 
all is confirmed  my lord 
which was reported 
i ll fight till from my bones
my flesh be hacked 
  give me my armour 
   tis not needed yet 
i ll put it on 
and now a wood comes toward dunsinane 
ring the alarum bell 
arm  arm  and out 
tyrant  show thy face 
there is nor flying hence
nor tarrying here 
i  gin to be aweary of the sun
and wish the estate o  the world
were now undone 
blow  wind 
come  wrack 
at least we ll die
with harness on our back 
 they have tied me to a stake 
 i cannot fly 
 but  bear like  i must fight the course 
 what s he that was not born of woman 
 such a one am i to fear  or none 
 why should i play the roman fool
and die on mine own sword  
whiles i see lives 
the gashes do better upon them 
turn  hellhound 
turn 
of all men else i have avoided thee 
but get thee back 
my soul is too much charged
with blood of thine already 
i have no words 
my voice is in my sword 
thou losest labour 
as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
with thy keen sword impress
as make me bleed 
let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests 
i bear a charmed life
which must not yield to one of woman born 
despair thy charm
and let the angel
whom thou still hast served tell thee
macduff was from his mother s womb
untimely ripped 
accursed be the tongue that tells me so 
for it hath cowed my better part of man 
i ll not fight with thee 
then yield thee  coward 
and live to be
the show and gaze of the time 
i will have thee 
as our rarer monsters are 
painted upon a pole 
and underwrit 
 here may you see the tyrant 
 macbeth  
i will not yield
to kiss the ground
before young malcolm s feet
and to be baited with the rabble s curse 
though birnam wood be come to dunsinane
and thou opposed 
being of no woman born 
yet i will try the last 
before my body i throw my warlike shield 
lay on  macduff 
and damned be him that first cries 
 hold  enough  
he s worth more sorrow 
and that i ll spend for him
