you  only you 
the first day of a new term 
here come the local
pubescent proles 
the future plumbers and shop assistants
and doubtless the odd terrorist  too 
in the old days  we confiscated
cigarettes and wank mags 
now it s knives and
crack cocaine 
and they call it progress

barbara 
this is your report 
on the history department 
on its entire workings and your general
thoughts for its future development 
you ll find it s quite thorough 
headmaster 
 the history department functions as one
would expect for a school of this intake 
 examination results have
been consistent for 30 years 
 below the national average but
above the level of catastrophe  
 recommendation 
no change necessary  
it took me most of the
summer to write it 
hard to read the wispy novice 
piss off  you prick 
is she a sphinx 
or simply stupid 
all right  off the phone  please 
give me the phone 
artfully dishevelled today 
the tweedy tramp coat
is an abhorrence 
it seems to say 
 i m just like you  
but clearly she s not 
a fey person  i suspect 
fey 
 boy  come on  come on  pass it 
yes  i m over here 
yeah 
   barbara  put your shirt on 
  i got the winner 
glory be  shirt

waters of our stagnant pond 
they flock to her 
even limp little brian had a go 
oh  the horror 
  hiya 
  oh  hello 
  that s a lovely blouse 
  what  oh 
and fatty hodge has
pounced on her 
a dubious double act 
the blonde and the
pig in knickers 
i just went past the art studio 
it s like bloody lord of the flies 
have they gone for her 
torn her posters down 
there s a paint fight 
they re chanting   get your tits out
for the lads   girls  too  it s carnage 
 man  how was madam 
lost it   stop it 
you little fucking bastards  
  you should have stepped in 
  he didn t want to patronise the lady 
this time next year
she ll be headmistress 
  oh  christ  will you shut up 
  sorry  sorry 
char  anyone 
babs 
  milk  no sugar 
  sweet enough 
  evidently 
  didn t her father invent inflation 
  you what 
  wasn t her dad that academic 
donald whatsit  economics bloke 
invented the word  inflation  
oh  yeah 
i know who you mean 
i think you ll find that mrs 
hart s father was ronald taylor 
he didn t invent inflation 
he devised a theory about
the relationship between inflation
and consumer expectation 
 sheba  davis  get off him

   boy  no  you re an arsehole 
   sheba  stop it 
 children  fight  fight

  steven connolly  miss

  steven connolly  miss 
  year 
  year 10  miss 
  you re the naked footballer 
why were you fighting 
it s a perfectly simple question 
  dunno  miss 
  you don t know 
one minute you re inert  the next
you re trying to castrate a pupil 
nothing occurred
between these two states 
no 
don t play the hero with me 
connolly  yes 
brain  mouth  speak 
he was saying stuff about miss 
it was bang out of order 
  what did you say 
  i never said nothing  miss 
 i didn t say anything  
what did he say  come on 
he said she s a tart  he said he
gave her one up the arse 
did you  indeed 
odious boy  apologise at once 
  sorry  miss 
   barbara  deputy head in the morning 
get back inside  both of you 
little towers of testosterone 
you ll soon get used to them 
thank you so much 
i d better    oh  i m sorry  we
haven t met properly  i m sheba hart 
barbara covett 
her voice is pure 
as if her mouth were empty and clean 
as if she d never had a filling 
the complexion of a white peach 
one can almost see her veins 
her trendy politics
are similarly transparent 
we serve them best if we teach
them to read  write and add 
they don t need to know
about basket weavers 
  barbara s keen on the basics 
  when you started 
didn t you want to give them
a real education
to help them overcome
the poverty of their backgrounds 
oh  yes  of course  but one soon
learns that teaching is crowd control 
come here 
you know you re not supposed   
we re a branch of the social services 
put that back  you 
console yourself with the gems 
that s when it s satisfying 
you can make a real difference 
the rest is just
cattle prod and pray 
i can see why others
are beguiled by her 
oh  hello 
i wonder if she possesses
the requisite heft 
  do you fancy a coffee 
  yeah 
   sue  sheba 
   phone beeps 
sorry 
that s the year 11s 
they re a nightmare 
do you want to join us 
we re going for a quick coffee 
  i ve got a bit of an announcement 
  you re leaving st george s 
no 
oh  you re pregnant 
that s fantastic 
oh  congratulations 
when are you due 
  june 7 
  a summer baby  how lovely 
i can t believe nobody s noticed 
i m 14 weeks 
didn t you see how
chunky i m getting 
didn t like to say 
where are you having it 
 sue  homerton 
it s really nice there 
lovely  friendly nurses 
i m going to find out at the next scan 
20 weeks 
  do you want to come to lunch on sunday 
  where 
to mine  to our house 
  won t you be with the family 
  oh  yes  but you re very welcome 
it s no big deal 
i ll just do a lasagne or something 
i adore lasagne 
bliss  a merry flag on the arctic
wilderness of my calendar 
one must make an effort
when one receives an invitation 
the art of it is seeming not to 
lasagne tends to disagree with my bowels 
i ll ask for a small portion 
oh  i think i ve got
the wrong house 
no  you re bang on  i m richard 
come in 
i m sorry  i thought   
that i d be 20 years younger
and handsome 
  bash 
   sheba  the kitchen s on fire 
sorry if you were there long 
the bell s knackered 
  hi  barbara 
  hello 
oh  what a splendid room 
what can i get you  we re semi pro
drinkers here  you name it 
 barbara  a dry sherry  please 
i think we might have some
apricot brandy knocking around 
  a dry white wine 
  done 
have a seat 
you must be polly 
i m barbara 
hi  barbara 
  are you going somewhere 
  excuse me 
  you re all poshed up 
  oh 
i have an appointment 
later  in town 
  have you always lived here 
  mum inherited it  it s her little joke 
i only married her for the property 
morning 
  did pete go 
  mm 
  he was welcome to stay 
  he s not really into lunch 
cheers 
mm 
are you interested in wine 
only the drinking part 
you 
  i spent the summer on the amalfi coast   
   boy shouting 
here s trouble  now  now  now 
now  now  now  easy  rocky  easy 
easy  peasy  wheezy 
i d anticipated a suave young
lawyer and two perfect poppets 
not so  she s married
some crumbling patriarch 
he s nearly as old as me 
and then there s the daughter 
a pocket princess 
and finally a somewhat tiresome
court jester 
ah  lovely  thank you 
  i m going to be a wizard 
   barbara  oh 
  is that when you re grown up 
  no  he s been cast in his school play 
i m gonna wear a
cape and my wand   
amongst next year s cultural highlights 
i greatly look forward to benjamin hart
in the key role of  the wizard   and i find
myself beside myself with anticipation 
a rogue image swam through me 
hubby s pruney old mouth
pursed at sheba s breast 
   funky kingston 
by toots and the maytals 
after lunch  a rather
mortifying family tradition 
they do things differently
in bourgeois bohemia 
oh  thank you 
come on  come on 
no 
 phone rings 
  you ready 
  watch out 
yes 
he took me away for our anniversary 
it was years ago 
when we came back it was here 
as if by magic 
oh 
it was supposed to
be my studio  but
it s more of a refuge  really 
a room of one s own 
is this you 
 sheba  mm 
it was 
oh  i love these 
such vibrant colours 
take one  take two 
have the lot  actually 
  i couldn t possibly 
  honestly  no one else wants them 
i ll treasure them 
it must be exhausting  running
a family and teaching as well 
oh  i can t wait for
term to end 
roll on christmas and
a month of sod all 
i shouldn t have kidded
myself i could teach 
it s just that i ve spent the
last ten years looking after ben
and i was so desperate
to get out and do something 
and finally we get him into this great
local school and i m free to work and   
  you re gonna be a terrific teacher 
  thanks 
but i m bloody hopeless 
and everyone knows it 
children are feral 
don t let them sense
your anxiety 
  how do you cope 
  oh  i m just a battle axe 
i m not popular 
but they respect me 
well  you re popular with me  it s
strange  i feel like i can talk to you 
she spoke of her vile mother 
her grief over the
death of her father 
the glory days when
richard scooped her up
and then jettisoned wife and children
for what she called a nonstop fuckfest 
it s a peculiar trait of the privileged 
immediate incautious intimacy 
but sheba went well beyond
the tendencies of her class 
she was utterly candid 
a novice confessing to
the mother superior 
you know  marriage and kids 
i mean  it s wonderful 
but it doesn t give you meaning 
it gives you an imperative
but it doesn t help you   
my father always used to say 
you know  on the tube   mind the gap  
i don t know  it s just the distance
between life as you dream it
and
life as it is 
i know exactly what you mean 
a gold star day 
i always knew we d be friends 
our mutual reserve inhibited us 
but now it is manifest 
a spiritual recognition 
 headmaster  many of you
will enjoy christmas 
s and i share the ability
to see through the quotidian
awfulness of things 
in a different  better age 
we would be ladies of leisure 
lunching together 
visiting galleries  travelling 
putting the world to rights 
we would be companions 
christ by highest heaven adored
christ the everlasting lord
late in time behold him come
offspring of a virgin s womb
it s taken 
i m saving it for sheba 
sorry 
hail the incarnate deity
pleased as man with man to dwell
jesus  emmanuel
hark  the herald angels sing
glory to the newborn king
 whispers 
very good 
well done 
 boys  hark 
the herald angels sing
 glory to the newborn king 
hark  the herald angels sing
 glory to the newborn king 
hark 
the herald angels sing
glory to the newborn king
 phone rings 
ben  pop it in the car 
sweetheart  hello 
i need to speak to you
about steven connolly 
  who 
  let s not  shall we 
doubtless you re aware
you ve committed a criminal of fence 
i ll be with you at five 
let s go to the pub  ok 
when will you tell them 
i need to know the circumstances 
you must inform me of everything 
actually  you were there
when i first saw him 
i think you gave him a telling off 
 barbara 
i gave him a slight ticking off 
 sheba 
he dedicated his goal to me 
it amused me  nothing more 
then a few days later he
came to see me 
would you have a
look at me drawings 
i ll look in class 
you do art  don t you 
i m not allowed 
i m special needs 
i gotta do extra reading instead 
did you do these at home 
these are good 
you can draw 
if we pull strings for one child
the whole system will unravel 
but he s talented 
he s found something he believes in 
well  they re all talented 
you found your gem 
as sue would say 
i said that i would teach him after
school  but only if he felt like it 
  it s our job  isn t it 
  within specified hours and curriculum 
barbara  he came every
day for two weeks 
yes  i was flattered 
but more than that 
i was excited to find someone
who wanted to learn 
and he imagined this sort of helicopter
500 years ago  it does your brain in 
 barbara  but surely you must have
suspected his motives 
i sensed he had a little crush
on me  but so what 
it was innocent 
that s so much better 
you ve absolutely got that knuckle 
nailed it 
  do that again  miss 
  don t be silly  off you go 
  what are you having for tea  miss 
  probably buy something on the way home 
  are you a good cook 
  not really 
you suck 
go home  steven 
  that s when you should have stopped it 
  i did 
i told him i wouldn t
teach him any more 
but he refused to accept it 
he just kept coming back 
miss 
 sheba  it began to feel
like our secret 
and secrets can be seductive 
  d you wanna come for a walk 
  absolutely not 
i m going home to my family 
as should you 
miss 
my dad s got the sack 
he s been taking it out on me 
 sheba  his father hit him  he didn t
tell his mum because she was ill 
  does your mother know 
  kidney disease 
  it s taking months for an operation 
  he was so vulnerable 
if he does it again  you tell me 
thanks  miss 
you re beautiful  miss 
you don t know how
beautiful you are 
 sheba  i hadn t been pursued
like this for years 
i knew it was wrong and immoral
and completely ridiculous 
but i don t know 
i just allowed it to happen 
the boy is 15 
  but he s quite mature for his age 
   but  is not a helpful word here 
this is going to sound sick
but something in me felt entitled  you
know  i ve been good all my adult life 
i ve been a decent wife 
dutiful mother  coping with ben 
this voice inside me kept saying 
 why shouldn t you be bad 
 you know  why shouldn t you transgress 
you ve earned the right  
i said get out  denzel 
the rest of you get on
with your work  please 
hurry up 
 ben laughs 
sue phoned 
ok if i meet her for a drink 
sure 
i ll put bug a lugs to bed 
evening  miss 
make yourself comfortable 
it s incredibly important
we keep this secret 
  does anyone know you re here 
  no 
miss 
i m no genius 
but i ain t a dickhead 
i won t tell no one 
you can trust me 
we d both get into
terrible trouble 
it was easy 
like having another drink
when you know you shouldn t 
can i smoke  miss 
you can do what you want 
but enough of this  miss  
were you a model once 
well  you should have been 
you re well fit 
gosh  but don t i know it 
you re into the streets 
well  my daughter is 
is she the same age as me 
none of your beeswax 
well  anyway 
the point is you re fit 
well  so are you 
you reckon  my sister thinks
i look like a bollock with measles 
you ve done my brain in 
  you wanna do it again 
   laughs 
what 
yes 
i wanna do it again 
i wanna do it again 
the day we met 
it had already begun 
yes 
deputy head in the morning 
noble sentiment  connolly 
next time  words  not fists 
get inside  both of you 
  and you had further relations that day 
  we went to the art room 
well  i m glad i was such an aphrodisiac 
i was trying to help you 
you did  i m incredibly grateful 
you ve been such a good friend 
not reciprocated  it seems 
i desperately wanted
to confess to you 
but how could i 
barbara 
it would have put you
in an impossible situation 
i so wish i had 
you would have made me see sense 
 barbara  and then i realised
my fury had blinded me 
there was a magnificent
opportunity here 
can we go inside 
i m absolutely freezing 
with stealth  i might secure
the prize long term 
forever in my debt 
i could gain everything
by doing nothing 
look   
i know you have to tell them 
you know  the head  the school 
all i ask is that you wait
till the new year 
i m begging you  please let me have
this christmas with my family 
oh  you poor thing 
you ve got yourself into a state 
i m not going to report you 
i want to help you 
to support you through this 
you re not going to tell 
  you won t tell anyone 
  who would it benefit 
not you or the boy 
and certainly not the school 
no  this is a private matter 
and we must keep it so 
yes 
  maybe i should resign 
  oh  no 
no  that might alert suspicion 
no  you must stay at the school 
but the affair must end 
your solemn promise 
i can t help you if
you don t promise 
i promise 
so you ll tell him straight
after christmas 
  it s all for the best 
  i know 
thank you so much 
you ve been so brilliant 
and you ll tell me
when it s done 
oh  you never said 
   barbara  standard issue for spinsters

you re very lovely  darling 
he s clever enough
to appreciate it 
i m fat as fuck  mum 
he ll be back 
i can t live without him 
oh   
her fetish for the boy was
simply her snobbery manifested 
he s working class
and he likes art 
as if he were a monkey who just
strolled out of a rainforest
and asked for a gin and tonic 
have you heard from
that friend of yours  barbara 
bar  wakey wakey 
lorraine was asking if you d heard
from that nice friend of yours 
  who 
  jennifer dodd 
oh 
she left the school 
she s teaching in a
primary at stoke 
there s a chap  apparently 
i heard they re engaged 
but it s true  it would be insane 
wouldn t it 
it s the most ridiculous
time for him to sell 
well  that s what i said 
i know 
he should give me a ring 
it s absolute madness
for him  i m happy to   
 sheba  there you are  darling 
   victorian parent or something

darling  can we have gravy 
there s no gravy  sorry 
why can t we just have   
 phone beeps 
 woman  god knows 
but this is what she s like 
ever since ronald died 
she s drifted inexorably 
you see  her father was
an exceptional man  exceptional 
bathsheba s a loner 
i m afraid 
she s beautiful  thank god 
and it s got her through 
but it s not quite the same
as possessing substance 
happy christmas

 phone beeps 
when i was at school
if one of us had had some
bad news or was a bit down 
we used to stroke each other 
you know  someone would do one arm
and someone else the other 
it was a wonderful sensation 
did you do that at your school 
no 
it s incredibly relaxing
for the giver and the receiver 
  close your eyes  no  no  really 
  oh   
it doesn t work if you don t 
  there s a good girl 
  that s enough 
no  close your eyes 
look  i really think
that s enough  barbara 
there s someone in your garden 
he came over the wall 
it s probably the neighbour s boy 
lost his football 
no  he s going into
the summer house 
it s just a kid from next door 
forget it 
 phone rings 
 steven  where are you  i ve been dreaming

i didn t mean to upset you  i need your help
more than ever  please don t go like this 
  you promised to end it  why didn t you 
  because i   
what  you re in love 
and the child  do you imagine he
reciprocates your soppy feelings 
i dare say he s fascinated by the neurotic
compulsions of a middle class lady
  with marital problems 
  bar   
there s nothing
crueller than boys 
once he s had his fill
he ll discard you like an old rag 
you re not young 
i say this to help you

you wanted a sob story 
i gave it to you 
  you lied to me 
  oh  sorry  miss

and your mother

the boy done her like a kipper 
she has nowhere to
turn but trusty old bar 
she mopes and mourns
for her pubescent paramour
but she knows my interventions
have saved her life
and she is sweetly grateful 
her betrayal hurt me
more than i dare show 
but i will forgive her
and heal myself in private 
she s worth it  this one 
she s the one i ve waited for 
she s beginning to understand that
her dalliance with master connolly
was a consequence
of her dead marriage 
it s a sham fuelled only
by the memory of former glories 
whereas we are going
through the fire 
forging our friendship
with a stronger bond each day 
in fact  we are now entering
a delicate new phase 
we are silently and stealthily
negotiating the terms
of a life lived together 
now more than ever 
we are bound by the
secrets we share 
i m invited to drop in on them this
summer at their house in the dordogne 
i might just do that 
i once sat here discussing
elgar for three hours 
  god  who with 
  oh  just a friend 
jennifer 
this was our haunt 
we were quite chummy for
a while  but poor thing 
  she suffered from a terrible depression 
  oh 
i tried to help 
but she rather unravelled 
she became alarmingly deluded 
did she go to hospital 
no 
no  she got a job in stoke 
  when was this 
  last summer 
  but i feel i should have done more 
  i m sure she knows you did your best 
such a sensitive person 
one conceals it  of course 
people languish for years with partners
who are clearly from another planet 
we want so much to believe
that we ve found our other 
it takes courage to recognise the real
as opposed to the convenient 
when i was young i had
such a vision of myself 
i dreamed i d be someone to be
reckoned with  you know  in the world 
but one learns one s scale 
i ve such a dread of
ending my days alone 
yes  i    we all do 
but recently i ve allowed myself
to think that i may not be 
am i wrong 
no 
   vet  do you want to stay 
   sobs 
sometimes people find it comforting
to see them at peace 
would you like to come back
in 20 minutes to say goodbye 
   sheba  have you got your seat belt on 
   richard  oh  no  what the fuck 
   polly  oh  god  not her 
  shut up  i won t be a minute 
   polly  mum  don t get out of the car 
  is it portia  oh  no 
i ve got to go back
to the vet s after it s done 
will you come with me 
i can t on my own 
of course i would  it s just that
ben s doing his play at his school   
  play 
  we re all going  we re late  actually 
  someone has died 
  i    i know 
  and it s terribly sad 
  you owe me this 
ben  can t you make her vanish 
use your wand 
he s doing a show for
the first time in his life 
  that s your choice  is it 
   car horn 
why don t you come 
i thought you understood
what friendship means 
he s my child  he s my son 
  he s just a little boy 
  don t play the good mother with me 
could you tell me what s going on 
is this some kind of coven 
i can explain perfectly 
barbara s had some bad
news about her cat 
my condolences  poor pussy 
now  can i have my wife back  please 
  i don t like your tone 
  why is she here 
what kind of fucking spell
has she cast on you 
  ben is getting stressed  he s gonna blow 
  oh  for god s sake  get in the car 
give me a minute  will you 
i can handle this 
i m to be handled  am i 
like toxic waste 
you see me on sufferance 
i m an imposition to be tolerated 
no  of course not  i love our time
together  i m your good  good friend 
  then stay with me 
   horn 
i would if i could 
i m desperately sorry about portia 
but you can see  i have to go 
think very carefully  madam 
be aware of the consequences 
don t make this mean
any more than it is 
stay with me 
 horn 
  i don t know what i ll do 
   polly  let s go 
  look  i ll call you  i promise 
   polly  come on 
they always let you
down in the end 
jennifer said i was too intense 
meaning what  exactly 
that i am loyal in my friendships 
that i will go to the ends of
the earth for someone i admire 
  shazam 
   applause 
 doorbell 
not disturbing you  am i 
it s just   
i need to talk to you
about mrs  hart 
  sheba 
  ah 
it s a bit delicate 
can i come in 
  tea 
  oh  lovely  thanks 
you haven t got a biscuit 
cheers 
  would you like me to take your hat 
  ah  been up the lane 
white hart lane 
home of the mighty spurs 
  were you victorious 
  three nil  jermain defoe  get in there 
my father was a supporter
of charlton athletic 
never seemed to give
him any pleasure 
where s the moggy 
she s dead 
oh  dear 
oh  my condolences  aw 
oh  is this not a good time 
it s a very good time 
  mrs  hart 
  yeah 
it s just   
anything you tell me
will be in strictest confidence 
well  the thing is 
i was wondering if she s
ever mentioned me 
does she ever mention me 
let me think 
no  never 
actually  yes 
she mentioned you had invested
in a new shirt last term 
splashed out at nicole farhi 
thing is  over the last few months    well 
ever since i met her  really  i ve   
brian  are you in love 
i ve been a bit bloody
obvious  haven t i 
you ve been utterly
clandestine 
  so she mentioned the shirt 
  you do know she s married 
yeah  but she s quite flirty  and you
never know with people  do you 
  indeed you don t 
  but   
i wouldn t wanna make a move
if i m just gonna get knocked back 
what with staff politics and the head being
such a stickler  you have to be careful 
it s a minefield 
so would   
i mean  do you think you
could have a word with her
and just suss the lie of the land 
you d like me to ask mrs  hart if she s
inclined to commit adultery with you 
i don t want you to suffer more
than is necessary  no one should 
i couldn t possibly speak for
mrs  hart  but instinct tells me
you might not be her type 
she s got a type  then 
oh  it s no reflection
on your attractiveness 
but my impression is that her
preference is for the younger man 
surprisingly young 
boys  i m told 
naturally  she doesn t discuss
any of this with me 
but i ve been hearing some rather
alarming rumours about one in particular 
playground gossip  staff
room whispers and so on 
you might know the boy in question 
steven connolly 
year 10 
i think the kettle s boiled 
you say the words and it s done 
easy 
judas had the grace to
hang himself 
but only according to matthew 
the most sentimental of the apostles 
is this the last night of
her old life 
i wonder how long
my messenger will take 
thank you 
people like sheba think they
know what it is to be lonely 
but of the drip  drip of long haul 
no end in sight solitude 
they know nothing 
what it s like to construct an entire
weekend around a visit to the launderette
or to be so chronically
untouched
that the accidental brush
of a bus conductor s hand
sends a jolt of longing
straight to your groin 
of this 
sheba and her like have no clue 
 phone rings 
 sheba  bar  i m so
sorry about today 
it was an impossible situation 
richard s really sorry too 
poor you 
but why not come for supper 
actually  i write quite quickly 
it s the thinking that
takes an eternity 
but you re never satisfied  when you re
lecturing  you long for time to write 
and when you ve got it  you yearn
to be back with your students 
   sheba  more coffee  anyone 
   richard  i ll have a slug 
barbara 
no  thank you 
 knocking continues 
  yes 
  are you her husband 
  what  whose 
  don t you dick with me  mister 
don t you dick me around 
where is she 
tell her steven connolly s
mother wants to see her now 
  excuse me 
   mr connolly  maggie 
  you slut  you fucking whore 
  maggie 
  how could you  how could you 
  maggie  maggie 
he s only a child  a wee boy 
he s a child 
 richard 
what the hell is going on 
you ask your wife what s going on 
ask her 
  you perverted bitch  bitch 
   mr connolly  maggie 
come on  leave them alone 
come on  maggie  leave them alone 
   maggie  bitch  you fucking   
   mr connolly  leave them alone  maggie 
come on  leave them alone  eh 
there s nothing for us here 
it happened 
it just happened 
people make things happen 
you think you re the only one
who s wanted someone young 
everyone sometimes 
everyone thinks about   
but they deal with it 
by the time i took my
seat in the gods 
the opera was well into
its final act 
  you re his teacher 
  and you were mine 
i m not justifying 
i m not trying to justify it 
you are so full of shit 
it s totally different 
you were 20 
he s 16 in may 
he s not some innocent   
of course he s innocent 
he s fucking 15 
are you insane 
if you meant to destroy us  why not do it
with an adult  that s the convention 
  it s worked for centuries 
  it wasn t about us  it   
  why 
  i just wanted him 
  why 
  i don t know 
well  find out 
  sheba  and    no 
  yep  connolly  yes  yes  honestly 
my guilt is tempered with relief 
she assumes the boy cracked
and told his mother all 
who am i to disabuse her 
oh  brian  brian 
brian 
brian  do stop a minute  please 
today  st george s school
is a solemn place 
a source close to the
school has indicated
another member of staff may have
known of the relationship 
this  however  is categorically
denied by the local authority 
had i known anything  i would
have informed you immediately 
my loyalty is to the school 
  brian thinks you ve known for months 
  brian 
  then there is sue   
  will you run through the entire staff 
if you knew and turned a blind eye 
you have enabled a crime 
  i didn t  so i haven t 
  you re due for retirement next year 
i think it would benefit everyone
if you take it early 
so it s a witch hunt 
salem comes to islington 
the stress of the job  radical
new ideas not to your taste   
i ve a radical idea  your school 
your disaster  why don t you resign 
because i am not the
confidante of a criminal 
now  tell me about your
friendship with mrs  hart 
i think you ll find a close friendship
between consenting adults is legal 
even under your regime 
my record is beyond reproach  the majority
of the staff regard me as a moral guardian 
i ve just spoken to an ex member of our
staff  another of your  close  friends 
jennifer dodd 
as you are aware  jennifer became unwell 
that s why she had to leave the school 
jennifer threatened you
with a restraining order 
that s nonsense 
a fax from her solicitor  she didn t
want you within 500 yards of her by law 
you call that a friendship 
she told me that you sent her
fiancé a wreath 
now  we wouldn t want all this
to come out  would we 
a lifetime of dedicated service
ending in shame and humiliation 
it s your choice  barbara 
 vomits 
 thumps door 
he knows it was me 
does she know  too 
more than i can bear  is that why
she s not returned my calls 
 phone rings 
 man  barbara  have you
spoken to sheba hart yet 
  why are you friends with a paedophile 
   woman  did you teach the boy at all 
 man  barbara  how s sheba s
husband taking all this 
barbarians

just for a few days 
you re welcome for as
long as you like 
 woman  when s she coming out

it s really none of your business 
 footsteps 
 woman  what about the kids 
i knew who you were when we met 
you were young  and i knew it might
get tough but i was prepared 
you re a good mother  but at times
you ve been a fucking lousy wife 
why didn t you come to me 
you could have told me
how lonely you were 
you never trusted me
to help you 
i m not saying i was so fucking
fabulous  but i was here 
 reporters shouting 
 man  there she is 
there she is 
this last month has been
the most delicious time of my life 
of course 
we ve had our ups and downs 
the pressure is intense when
two women share their lives 
but  oh  what
marvelous intensity it is 
   man  it s the crone 
   laughter 
  barbara 
   woman  barbara  barbara 
is sheba coming out 
circumstances are not always ideal 
the swinish press 
the stringent bail terms 
meetings with lawyers and so on 
but all things considered 
we  re coping admirably 
in fact  gold stars abundant 
the cuckold permits her
to see their children once a week 
there are usually tears
and fits of teenage
tantrums  too 
in time  she ll recognise she s
just not the mothering kind 
and then barbara will be
there to comfort her 
nurse  beloved friend 
and wise counsel 
 man  the crone returneth 
 woman  were you pushed
or did you jump 
 man  2  if you jumped 
was it into a dyke 
is sheba alive 
what have you done with her 
 woman  2  how s the family
coping  barbara 
barbara  barbara 
barbara 
sheba 
what you say about me 
about richard   
you re not fit to
shine his shoes 
and ben and
polly 
that i d be happier
without them 
why did you do it 
because i didn t help you
collect your cat 
you ve cost me my family 
take some responsibility 
i gave you exactly what you wanted  you d
still be stuck in that marriage without me 
  what

  you think i wanted to be here with you 
  you need me  i m your friend 
you ve put me in prison 
i could get two years 
they ll fly by  i ll visit you every week 
we ve so much life to live together 
you think this is a love affair 
a relationship 
what  sticky gold stars
and a strand of my hair 
and a receipt from pizza express 
it s a flat in the archway road
and you think you re
virginia frigging woolf 
where did you get my hair 
did you pluck it from the
bath with fucking tweezers 
don t you know it s rude
to read a person s diary 
we re not companions  we re not
friends  you don t like me 
that s not true  i only have
tender feelings for you  only love 
you re barking  fucking mad 
you don t know how to love 
you have never your whole life 
me  jennifer dodd   
you re nothing but waste
and disappointment 
you bitter old virgin 
you re lonely for a reason  they
loathed you at school  all of them 
i was the idiot who bothered  but only
because no one told me you re a vampire 
so what is it  bar  you wanna roll
around the floor like lovers 
  you wanna fuck me 
  please don t diminish our   
  our what  what

 reporters shouting
