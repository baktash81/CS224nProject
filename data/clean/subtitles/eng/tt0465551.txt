you only you
the first day of a new term
here come the local
pubescent proles
the future plumbers and shop assistants
and doubtless the odd terrorist too
in the old days we confiscated
cigarettes and wank mags
now its knives and
crack cocaine
and they call it progress

ill be up till the crack of dawn
anyone else not handed in

thank you
lovely thank you
barbara
this is your report
on the history department
on its entire workings and your general
thoughts for its future development
youll find its quite thorough
headmaster
the history department functions as one
would expect for a school of this intake
examination results have
been consistent for 30 years
below the national average but
above the level of catastrophe
recommendation
no change necessary
it took me most of the
summer to write it
hard to read the wispy novice
piss off you prick
is she a sphinx
or simply stupid
all right off the phone please
give me the phone
artfully dishevelled today
the tweedy tramp coat
is an abhorrence
it seems to say
im just like you
but clearly shes not
a fey person i suspect
fey
boy come on come on pass it
yes im over here
yeah
barbara put your shirt on
i got the winner
glory be shirt
she has certainly rippled the
waters of our stagnant pond
they flock to her
even limp little brian had a go
oh the horror
hiya
oh hello
thats a lovely blouse
what oh
and fatty hodge has
pounced on her
a dubious double act
the blonde and the
pig in knickers
i just went past the art studio
its like bloody lord of the flies
have they gone for her
torn her posters down
theres a paint fight
theyre chanting get your tits out
for the lads girls too its carnage
man how was madam
lost it stop it
you little fucking bastards
you should have stepped in
he didnt want to patronise the lady
this time next year
shell be headmistress
oh christ will you shut up
sorry sorry
char anyone
babs
milk no sugar
sweet enough
evidently
didnt her father invent inflation
you what
wasnt her dad that academic
donald whatsit economics bloke
invented the word inflation
oh yeah
i know who you mean
i think youll find that mrs
harts father was ronald taylor
he didnt invent inflation
he devised a theory about
the relationship between inflation
and consumer expectation
sheba davis get off him
stop it
boy no youre an arsehole
sheba stop it
children fight fight
fight fight fight
stop it stop it immediately
fight fight fight fight fight
fight fight fight fight fight fight
sheba youre going to hurt
one another now stop it
davis get off him

barbara absolute silence absolute
why were they fighting mrs hart
their motive was unclear
davis i know youre a little thug
who might you be
steven connolly miss
what
steven connolly miss
year
year 10 miss
youre the naked footballer
why were you fighting
its a perfectly simple question
dunno miss
you dont know
one minute youre inert the next
youre trying to castrate a pupil
nothing occurred
between these two states
no
dont play the hero with me
connolly yes
brain mouth speak
he was saying stuff about miss
it was bang out of order
what did you say
i never said nothing miss
i didnt say anything
what did he say come on
he said shes a tart he said he
gave her one up the arse
did you indeed
odious boy apologise at once
sorry miss
barbara deputy head in the morning
get back inside both of you
little towers of testosterone
youll soon get used to them
thank you so much
id better oh im sorry we
havent met properly im sheba hart
barbara covett
her voice is pure
as if her mouth were empty and clean
as if shed never had a filling
the complexion of a white peach
one can almost see her veins
her trendy politics
are similarly transparent
we serve them best if we teach
them to read write and add
they dont need to know
about basket weavers
barbaras keen on the basics
when you started
didnt you want to give them
a real education
to help them overcome
the poverty of their backgrounds
oh yes of course but one soon
learns that teaching is crowd control
come here
you know youre not supposed
were a branch of the social services
put that back you
console yourself with the gems
thats when its satisfying
you can make a real difference
the rest is just
cattleprod and pray
i can see why others
are beguiled by her
oh hello
i wonder if she possesses
the requisite heft
do you fancy a coffee
yeah
sue sheba
phone beeps
sorry
thats the year 11s
theyre a nightmare
do you want to join us
were going for a quick coffee
ive got a bit of an announcement
youre leaving st georges
no
oh youre pregnant
thats fantastic
oh congratulations
when are you due
june 7
a summer baby how lovely
i cant believe nobodys noticed
im 14 weeks
didnt you see how
chunky im getting
didnt like to say
where are you having it
sue homerton
its really nice there
lovely friendly nurses
im going to find out at the next scan
20 weeks
do you want to come to lunch on sunday
where
to mine to our house
wont you be with the family
oh yes but youre very welcome
its no big deal
ill just do a lasagne or something
i adore lasagne
bliss a merry flag on the arctic
wilderness of my calendar
one must make an effort
when one receives an invitation
the art of it is seeming not to
lasagne tends to disagree with my bowels
ill ask for a small portion
oh i think ive got
the wrong house
no youre bang on im richard
come in
im sorry i thought
that id be 20 years younger
and handsome
bash
sheba the kitchens on fire
sorry if you were there long
the bells knackered
hi barbara
hello
oh what a splendid room
what can i get you were semipro
drinkers here you name it
barbara a dry sherry please
i think we might have some
apricot brandy knocking around
a dry white wine
done
have a seat
you must be polly
im barbara
hi barbara
are you going somewhere
excuse me
youre all poshed up
oh
i have an appointment
later in town
have you always lived here
mum inherited it its her little joke
i only married her for the property
morning
did pete go
mm
he was welcome to stay
hes not really into lunch
cheers
mm
are you interested in wine
only the drinking part
you
i spent the summer on the amalfi coast
boy shouting
heres trouble now now now
now now now easy rocky easy
easy peasy wheezy
id anticipated a suave young
lawyer and two perfect poppets
not so shes married
some crumbling patriarch
hes nearly as old as me
and then theres the daughter
a pocket princess
and finally a somewhat tiresome
court jester
ah lovely thank you
im going to be a wizard
barbara oh
is that when youre grown up
no hes been cast in his school play
im gonna wear a
cape and my wand
amongst next years cultural highlights
i greatly look forward to benjamin hart
in the key role of the wizard and i find
myself beside myself with anticipation
a rogue image swam through me
hubbys pruney old mouth
pursed at shebas breast
funky kingston
by toots and the maytals
after lunch a rather
mortifying family tradition
they do things differently
in bourgeois bohemia
oh thank you
come on come on
no
phone rings
you ready
watch out
yes
he took me away for our anniversary
it was years ago
when we came back it was here
as if by magic
oh
it was supposed to
be my studio but
its more of a refuge really
a room of ones own
is this you
sheba mm
it was
oh i love these
such vibrant colours
take one take two
have the lot actually
i couldnt possibly
honestly no one else wants them
ill treasure them
it must be exhausting running
a family and teaching as well
oh i cant wait for
term to end
roll on christmas and
a month of sod all
i shouldnt have kidded
myself i could teach
its just that ive spent the
last ten years looking after ben
and i was so desperate
to get out and do something
and finally we get him into this great
local school and im free to work and
youre gonna be a terrific teacher
thanks
but im bloody hopeless
and everyone knows it
children are feral
dont let them sense
your anxiety
how do you cope
oh im just a battleaxe
im not popular
but they respect me
well youre popular with me its
strange i feel like i can talk to you
she spoke of her vile mother
her grief over the
death of her father
the glory days when
richard scooped her up
and then jettisoned wife and children
for what she called a nonstop fuckfest
its a peculiar trait of the privileged
immediate incautious intimacy
but sheba went well beyond
the tendencies of her class
she was utterly candid
a novice confessing to
the mother superior
you know marriage and kids
i mean its wonderful
but it doesnt give you meaning
it gives you an imperative
but it doesnt help you
my father always used to say
you know on the tube mind the gap
i dont know its just the distance
between life as you dream it
and
life as it is
i know exactly what you mean
a goldstar day
i always knew wed be friends
our mutual reserve inhibited us
but now it is manifest
a spiritual recognition
headmaster many of you
will enjoy christmas
s and i share the ability
to see through the quotidian
awfulness of things
in a different better age
we would be ladies of leisure
lunching together
visiting galleries travelling
putting the world to rights
we would be companions
christ by highest heaven adored
christ the everlasting lord
late in time behold him come
offspring of a virgins womb
its taken
im saving it for sheba
sorry
hail the incarnate deity
pleased as man with man to dwell
jesus emmanuel
hark the herald angels sing
glory to the newborn king
whispers
very good
well done
boys hark
the herald angels sing
glory to the newborn king
hark the herald angels sing
glory to the newborn king
hark
the herald angels sing
glory to the newborn king
phone rings
ben pop it in the car
sweetheart hello
i need to speak to you
about steven connolly
who
lets not shall we
doubtless youre aware
youve committed a criminal of fence
ill be with you at five
lets go to the pub ok
when will you tell them
i need to know the circumstances
you must inform me of everything
actually you were there
when i first saw him
i think you gave him a telling off
barbara
i gave him a slight ticking off
sheba
he dedicated his goal to me
it amused me nothing more
then a few days later he
came to see me
would you have a
look at me drawings
ill look in class
you do art dont you
im not allowed
im special needs
i gotta do extra reading instead
did you do these at home
these are good
you can draw
if we pull strings for one child
the whole system will unravel
but hes talented
hes found something he believes in
well theyre all talented
you found your gem
as sue would say
i said that i would teach him after
school but only if he felt like it
its our job isnt it
within specified hours and curriculum
barbara he came every
day for two weeks
yes i was flattered
but more than that
i was excited to find someone
who wanted to learn
and he imagined this sort of helicopter
500 years ago it does your brain in
barbara but surely you must have
suspected his motives
i sensed he had a little crush
on me but so what
it was innocent
thats so much better
youve absolutely got that knuckle
nailed it
do that again miss
dont be silly off you go
what are you having for tea miss
probably buy something on the way home
are you a good cook
not really
you suck
go home steven
thats when you should have stopped it
i did
i told him i wouldnt
teach him any more
but he refused to accept it
he just kept coming back
miss
sheba it began to feel
like our secret
and secrets can be seductive
dyou wanna come for a walk
absolutely not
im going home to my family
as should you
miss
my dads got the sack
hes been taking it out on me
sheba his father hit him he didnt
tell his mum because she was ill
does your mother know
kidney disease
its taking months for an operation
he was so vulnerable
if he does it again you tell me
thanks miss
youre beautiful miss
you dont know how
beautiful you are
sheba i hadnt been pursued
like this for years
i knew it was wrong and immoral
and completely ridiculous
but i dont know
i just allowed it to happen
the boy is 15
but hes quite mature for his age
but is not a helpful word here
this is going to sound sick
but something in me felt entitled you
know ive been good all my adult life
ive been a decent wife
dutiful mother coping with ben
this voice inside me kept saying
why shouldnt you be bad
you know why shouldnt you transgress
youve earned the right
i said get out denzel
the rest of you get on
with your work please
hurry up
ben laughs
sue phoned
ok if i meet her for a drink
sure
ill put bugalugs to bed
evening miss
make yourself comfortable
its incredibly important
we keep this secret
does anyone know youre here
no
miss
im no genius
but i aint a dickhead
i wont tell no one
you can trust me
wed both get into
terrible trouble
it was easy
like having another drink
when you know you shouldnt
can i smoke miss
you can do what you want
but enough of this miss
were you a model once
well you should have been
youre well fit
gosh but dont i know it
youre into the streets
well my daughter is
is she the same age as me
none of your beeswax
well anyway
the point is youre fit
well so are you
you reckon my sister thinks
i look like a bollock with measles
youve done my brain in
you wanna do it again
laughs
what
yes
i wanna do it again
i wanna do it again
the day we met
it had already begun
yes
deputy head in the morning
noble sentiment connolly
next time words not fists
get inside both of you
and you had further relations that day
we went to the art room
well im glad i was such an aphrodisiac
i was trying to help you
you did im incredibly grateful
youve been such a good friend
not reciprocated it seems
i desperately wanted
to confess to you
but how could i
barbara
it would have put you
in an impossible situation
i so wish i had
you would have made me see sense
barbara and then i realised
my fury had blinded me
there was a magnificent
opportunity here
can we go inside
im absolutely freezing
with stealth i might secure
the prize long term
forever in my debt
i could gain everything
by doing nothing
look
i know you have to tell them
you know the head the school
all i ask is that you wait
till the new year
im begging you please let me have
this christmas with my family
oh you poor thing
youve got yourself into a state
im not going to report you
i want to help you
to support you through this
youre not going to tell
you wont tell anyone
who would it benefit
not you or the boy
and certainly not the school
no this is a private matter
and we must keep it so
yes
maybe i should resign
oh no
no that might alert suspicion
no you must stay at the school
but the affair must end
your solemn promise
i cant help you if
you dont promise
i promise
so youll tell him straight
after christmas
its all for the best
i know
thank you so much
youve been so brilliant
and youll tell me
when its done
oh you never said

youre very lovely darling
hes clever enough
to appreciate it
im fat as fuck mum
hell be back
i cant live without him
oh
her fetish for the boy was
simply her snobbery manifested
hes working class
and he likes art
as if he were a monkey who just
strolled out of a rainforest
and asked for a gin and tonic
have you heard from
that friend of yours barbara
bar wakeywakey
lorraine was asking if youd heard
from that nice friend of yours
who
jennifer dodd
oh
she left the school
shes teaching in a
primary at stoke
theres a chap apparently
i heard theyre engaged
but its true it would be insane
wouldnt it
its the most ridiculous
time for him to sell
well thats what i said
i know
he should give me a ring
its absolute madness
for him im happy to
sheba there you are darling
victorian parent or something
im nothing of the kind
darling can we have gravy
theres no gravy sorry

ever since ronald died
shes drifted inexorably
you see her father was
an exceptional man exceptional
bathshebas a loner
im afraid
shes beautiful thank god
and its got her through
but its not quite the same
as possessing substance
happy christmas

matter of weeks
shes only a pet
oh no
i cried for weeks
when our dog died weeks
one does get so attached
i should leave you in peace
yeah
i like that top it suits you
oh thanks
phone beeps
when i was at school
if one of us had had some
bad news or was a bit down
we used to stroke each other
you know someone would do one arm
and someone else the other
it was a wonderful sensation
did you do that at your school
no
its incredibly relaxing
for the giver and the receiver
close your eyes no no really
oh
it doesnt work if you dont
theres a good girl
thats enough
no close your eyes
look i really think
thats enough barbara
theres someone in your garden
he came over the wall
its probably the neighbours boy
lost his football
no hes going into
the summer house
its just a kid from next door
forget it
phone rings
steven where are you ive been dreaming
about your hot sweet cunt all morning
hello
hello
richards on his way home
no i cant no i cant ill call you
barbara barbara im sorry im sorry
im so sorry bar
i tried to end it honestly
i just couldnt
i risked everything for you
and in return you humiliate me
i didnt mean to upset you i need your help
more than ever please dont go like this
you promised to end it why didnt you
because i
what youre in love
and the child do you imagine he
reciprocates your soppy feelings
i dare say hes fascinated by the neurotic
compulsions of a middleclass lady
with marital problems
bar
theres nothing
crueller than boys
once hes had his fill
hell discard you like an old rag
youre not young
i say this to help you
end it now
yeah im thinking
dont think do
do do do do or shall i sit here doing
my nails till your husband returns
no no no please ill do it
well what are you waiting for
doorbell
mr connolly
im mrs hart from st georges
stevens not in trouble
i need to talk to him
about an art project
oh yeah come in come in
thank you
its just upstairs there
its good of you to give him extra
lessons its the first on your left
its probably best to knock
so thats your vicious father
you wanted a sob story
i gave it to you
you lied to me
oh sorry miss
you prefer it if i
live in a shithole
and your mother
i think shes gonna pull through
what do you want
what are you doing here
theyre gonna expel me now
no they wont
ill get the blame if she tells
as if she wont
she likes me she might not
likes you how like that
you giving her one and all
why are you being so cruel
why steven
i really like you
youre a nice person
and youve been cool
and its been great ok
but it was supposed to be fun
and now its a serious thing
whatever shit youre working out you
know your husband your kid you
i dont know
i cant help you
sobs
as my mother would have said
the boy done her like a kipper
she has nowhere to
turn but trusty old bar
she mopes and mourns
for her pubescent paramour
but she knows my interventions
have saved her life
and she is sweetly grateful
her betrayal hurt me
more than i dare show
but i will forgive her
and heal myself in private
shes worth it this one
shes the one ive waited for
shes beginning to understand that
her dalliance with master connolly
was a consequence
of her dead marriage
its a sham fuelled only
by the memory of former glories
whereas we are going
through the fire
forging our friendship
with a stronger bond each day
in fact we are now entering
a delicate new phase
we are silently and stealthily
negotiating the terms
of a life lived together
now more than ever
we are bound by the
secrets we share
im invited to drop in on them this
summer at their house in the dordogne
i might just do that
i once sat here discussing
elgar for three hours
god who with
oh just a friend
jennifer
this was our haunt
we were quite chummy for
a while but poor thing
she suffered from a terrible depression
oh
i tried to help
but she rather unravelled
she became alarmingly deluded
did she go to hospital
no
no she got a job in stoke
when was this
last summer
but i feel i should have done more
im sure she knows you did your best
such a sensitive person
one conceals it of course
people languish for years with partners
who are clearly from another planet
we want so much to believe
that weve found our other
it takes courage to recognise the real
as opposed to the convenient
when i was young i had
such a vision of myself
i dreamed id be someone to be
reckoned with you know in the world
but one learns ones scale
ive such a dread of
ending my days alone
yes i we all do
but recently ive allowed myself
to think that i may not be
am i wrong
no
vet do you want to stay
sobs
sometimes people find it comforting
to see them at peace
would you like to come back
in 20 minutes to say goodbye
sheba have you got your seat belt on
richard oh no what the fuck
polly oh god not her
shut up i wont be a minute
polly mum dont get out of the car
is it portia oh no
ive got to go back
to the vets after its done
will you come with me
i cant on my own
of course i would its just that
bens doing his play at his school
play
were all going were late actually
someone has died
i i know
and its terribly sad
you owe me this
ben cant you make her vanish
use your wand
hes doing a show for
the first time in his life
thats your choice is it
car horn
why dont you come
i thought you understood
what friendship means
hes my child hes my son
hes just a little boy
dont play the good mother with me
could you tell me whats going on
is this some kind of coven
i can explain perfectly
barbaras had some bad
news about her cat
my condolences poor pussy
now can i have my wife back please
i dont like your tone
why is she here
what kind of fucking spell
has she cast on you
ben is getting stressed hes gonna blow
oh for gods sake get in the car
give me a minute will you
i can handle this
im to be handled am i
like toxic waste
you see me on sufferance
im an imposition to be tolerated
no of course not i love our time
together im your good good friend
then stay with me
horn
i would if i could
im desperately sorry about portia
but you can see i have to go
think very carefully madam
be aware of the consequences
dont make this mean
any more than it is
stay with me
horn
i dont know what ill do
polly lets go
look ill call you i promise
polly come on
they always let you
down in the end
jennifer said i was too intense
meaning what exactly
that i am loyal in my friendships
that i will go to the ends of
the earth for someone i admire
shazam
applause
doorbell
not disturbing you am i
its just
i need to talk to you
about mrs hart
sheba
ah
its a bit delicate
can i come in
tea
oh lovely thanks
you havent got a biscuit
cheers
would you like me to take your hat
ah been up the lane
white hart lane
home of the mighty spurs
were you victorious
threenil jermain defoe get in there
my father was a supporter
of charlton athletic
never seemed to give
him any pleasure
wheres the moggy
shes dead
oh dear
oh my condolences aw
oh is this not a good time
its a very good time
mrs hart
yeah
its just
anything you tell me
will be in strictest confidence
well the thing is
i was wondering if shes
ever mentioned me
does she ever mention me
let me think
no never
actually yes
she mentioned you had invested
in a new shirt last term
splashed out at nicole farhi
thing is over the last few months well
ever since i met her really ive
brian are you in love
ive been a bit bloody
obvious havent i
youve been utterly
clandestine
so she mentioned the shirt
you do know shes married
yeah but shes quite flirty and you
never know with people do you
indeed you dont
but
i wouldnt wanna make a move
if im just gonna get knocked back
what with staff politics and the head being
such a stickler you have to be careful
its a minefield
so would
i mean do you think you
could have a word with her
and just suss the lie of the land
youd like me to ask mrs hart if shes
inclined to commit adultery with you
i dont want you to suffer more
than is necessary no one should
i couldnt possibly speak for
mrs hart but instinct tells me
you might not be her type
shes got a type then
oh its no reflection
on your attractiveness
but my impression is that her
preference is for the younger man
surprisingly young
boys im told
naturally she doesnt discuss
any of this with me
but ive been hearing some rather
alarming rumours about one in particular
playground gossip staff
room whispers and so on
you might know the boy in question
steven connolly
year 10
i think the kettles boiled
you say the words and its done
easy
judas had the grace to
hang himself
but only according to matthew

is this the last night of
her old life
i wonder how long
my messenger will take
thank you
people like sheba think they
know what it is to be lonely
but of the drip drip of longhaul
noendinsight solitude
they know nothing
what its like to construct an entire
weekend around a visit to the launderette
or to be so chronically
untouched
that the accidental brush
of a bus conductors hand
sends a jolt of longing
straight to your groin
of this
sheba and her like have no clue
phone rings
sheba bar im so
sorry about today
it was an impossible situation
richards really sorry too
poor you
but why not come for supper
actually i write quite quickly
its the thinking that
takes an eternity
but youre never satisfied when youre
lecturing you long for time to write
and when youve got it you yearn
to be back with your students
sheba more coffee anyone

seat in the gods

with an adult thats the convention
its worked for centuries
it wasnt about us it

sheba and no
yep connolly yes yes honestly
my guilt is tempered with relief
she assumes the boy cracked
and told his mother all

oh brian brian
brian
brian do stop a minute please
today st georges school
is a solemn place
a source close to the
school has indicated
another member of staff may have
known of the relationship
this however is categorically
denied by the local authority
had i known anything i would
have informed you immediately
my loyalty is to the school
brian thinks youve known for months
brian
then there is sue
will you run through the entire staff
if you knew and turned a blind eye
you have enabled a crime
i didnt so i havent
youre due for retirement next year
i think it would benefit everyone
if you take it early
so its a witch hunt
salem comes to islington
the stress of the job radical
new ideas not to your taste
ive a radical idea your school
your disaster why dont you resign
because i am not the
confidante of a criminal
now tell me about your
friendship with mrs hart
i think youll find a close friendship
between consenting adults is legal
even under your regime
my record is beyond reproach the majority
of the staff regard me as a moral guardian
ive just spoken to an exmember of our
staff another of your close friends
jennifer dodd
as you are aware jennifer became unwell
thats why she had to leave the school
jennifer threatened you
with a restraining order
thats nonsense
a fax from her solicitor she didnt
want you within 500 yards of her by law
you call that a friendship
she told me that you sent her
fiancé a wreath
now we wouldnt want all this
to come out would we
a lifetime of dedicated service
ending in shame and humiliation
its your choice barbara
vomits
thumps door
he knows it was me
does she know too
more than i can bear is that why
shes not returned my calls
phone rings

you could have told me
how lonely you were
you never trusted me
to help you
im not saying i was so fucking
fabulous but i was here
reporters shouting
man there she is

this last month has been
the most delicious time of my life
of course
weve had our ups and downs
the pressure is intense when
two women share their lives
but oh what
marvelous intensity it is
man its the crone
laughter
barbara
woman barbara barbara
is sheba coming out
circumstances are not always ideal
the swinish press
the stringent bail terms
meetings with lawyers and so on
but all things considered
we re coping admirably
in fact gold stars abundant
the cuckold permits her
to see their children once a week
there are usually tears
and fits of teenage
tantrums too
in time shell recognise shes
just not the mothering kind
and then barbara will be
there to comfort her
nurse beloved friend
and wise counsel
man the crone returneth
woman were you pushed
or did you jump
man 2 if you jumped
was it into a dyke
is sheba alive
what have you done with her
woman 2 hows the family

bath with fucking tweezers

around the floor like lovers
