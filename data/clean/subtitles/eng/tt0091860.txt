gotta test our loyalty against all odds 
it s kind of exciting 
i feel like chuck norris  you know 
 teacher  so  what was accomplished 
i mean  that s the normal question 
all the hippies are executives now 
and everybody s sold out 
well  let me tell you something  tom 
save it  kevin 
fundamental changes were made 
changes so basic
that we now take  em for granted 
the civil rights movement 
later the women s movement 
i mean  like it or not  ladies 
you re now expected to have careers 
then maybe later
the husbands and the babies 
and vietnam 
we stopped a war  man 
we took to the streets
and made a difference 
we turned public sentiment around 
and we made people see the truth  not
that we always thought good thoughts 
cops around you cracking skulls 
you got a picket sign in your hand 
you re not thinking about
stopping the war now 
you re thinking about
knocking a few pigs on their asses 
but as crazy as it all seemed  though 
there was a meaning in the madness 
a clear and a real purpose 
  but don t you think violence is wrong 
  fuck off  kevin  wasting pigs is radical 
 bell

 maybe they can sew that leg back on  
and then there comes the ambulance
and runs right over all of it 
  wasted that leg

i figure once you start fighting 
you re always defending yourself 
me  i get in a fight 
i go fucking crazy  you know 
everything goes black 
and then i fucking explode  you know 
like it s the end of the world  who cares
if this guy wastes me  i ll waste him first 
the whole world s gonna blow up
anyway  i might as well keep my pride 
i got this philosophy 
you do shit  and it s done   
and then you die 
you got any more beer 
shit  what time is it  is it two yet 
  it s creeping up 
  fuck  man  time for a beer run

  we had to yell something 
  you yelled it 
i ve got a name 
you re lucky i didn t just drive home 
ok  ok  ok  i m sorry  clarissa 
but you ve got to understand that at a time
like this  where every second counts 
a man can t waste his time
choosing words 
  what is this  mission  lmpossible 
   matt hums theme

to the cops and tell them where john is 
i wouldn t even joke about that  clarissa 
what would you do  kill me 
you d love that  i bet 
you and john could run off
and be outlaws together 
but first  to show off  strap my body to
the top of this car and drive all over town 
get    out 
what 
you don t understand
a goddamn thing  do you 
jamie is dead  dammit 
and there s nothing that we can do to
save her  now  i happened to like jamie 
but john is still alive 
don t you see that 
and who s next on his list 
you re just gonna leave me here 
what if john s around 
ask him to forgive you 
here  here s your money 
we don t need this shit 
  we can t just leave her alone like this

about getting me  i know he does 
so don t even say he doesn t 
  doesn t he 
  not to me 
you look kinda cute
when you lie  you know

you should see him when no one s
around and he s alone with me 
and he thinks he might get lucky 
shakes like a leaf 
always has to be drunk  too 
he s like layne   portrait of a teenage
alcoholic  they could make a movie

your little brother 
he s 12 years old  he hasn t come home

what am i supposed to do 
i m not his mother

i am nobody s mother 
i give up this mother bullshit  it s not

don t give up  mommy 
i m gonna leave you all 
just like your father did 
jesus  ma  settle down  ok 
tim s all right

look  i got somebody waiting outside
for me  i m in a rush  we ll talk later 
i m gonna take this joint  and don t
worry about tim  ok  i ll get him home 
yeah  it really shocked me 
i think killing is wrong 
 woman  what about all those people
going to see the body 
that shocked me too 
i think they should have arrested john 
  john 
  well  he killed jamie 
  you knew the killer 
  yeah 
you know  we both kinda knew the killer 
as well as  um  in addition to 
you know  who he killed  too 
i mean  because of that 
it s pretty hard for us to be  um   
  objective 
  yeah  that s it  objective 
you know  since we knew the two
alleged people involved and everything 
and whereas we might be upset
this morning or something 
you know  we re not  because of
the fact that we re not objective at all 
i also play guitar  by the way 
  you don t even know what a friend is 
  i m tired 
  you call samson a friend 
  don t i get a phone call 
enough of a friend to cover up for 
help him hide the body  maybe   
maybe even help him kill the poor girl 
i didn t kill nobody 
did he tell you why he did it 
weren t you even curious 
did you even give a flying fuck 
these are stupid questions  i know
my rights  i know i get a phone call 
you don t have any rights just yet  layne 
we haven t arrested you 
great  see you 
ok 
ok  ok 
go  make your phone call 
go call one of your precious friends 
  i asked you a question 
  i didn t know her  ok 
i just want to say 
it was horrible what those kids did 
and the incident points up a fundamental
moral breakdown in our society 
thank you  kevin  for your
insightful self righteous indignation 
  i d still like to hear from tom 
  just quit staring at me like that  man 
  clarissa 
  sorry i m late 
you knew jamie  right 
you were one of her friends 
describe to us how you remember her 
remember her 
yeah  what she looked like 
what she meant to you 
you re bullshit  what gives you the right
to put clarissa on the spot like that 
i mean  she s upset  man 
her friend is dead 
are you upset  clarissa 
are you  i mean  if you are 
come on  let s get it off your chest 
fuck you 
why don t you just leave her alone 
no  fuck you  man 
because i don t buy it 
you don t give a damn 
i don t give a damn  nobody in this
classroom gives a damn that she is dead 
it gives us a chance to feel superior 
and to point up a fundamental
moral breakdown in society 
but it doesn t really affect us  does it 
because if it did  none of us would
be in this classroom right now 
we d be out on the street 
half crazy from lack of sleep 
hunting down samson toulette
with a gun 
  that s a reprehensible attitude 
  just shut up  kevin 
are we gonna be tested on this shit 
 bell 
it s gonna be like this all day  teachers
lecturing us about what monsters we are 
  i can t handle much more 
  i say we split  got just the place  too
