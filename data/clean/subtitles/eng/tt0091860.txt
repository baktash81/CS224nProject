the husbands and the babies

and made a difference
we turned public sentiment around
and we made people see the truth not
that we always thought good thoughts
cops around you cracking skulls
you got a picket sign in your hand
youre not thinking about
stopping the war now
youre thinking about
knocking a few pigs on their asses

i remember lying in the gutter
all bleeding and shaking
staring at my leg right next to a beer can

i wonder if theres any beer in that can
i also remember thinking
maybe they can sew that leg back on
and then there comes the ambulance
and runs right over all of it
wasted that leg

the whole worlds gonna blow up

yeah it really shocked me
i think killing is wrong
woman what about all those people
going to see the body
that shocked me too
i think they should have arrested john
john
well he killed jamie
you knew the killer
yeah
you know we both kinda knew the killer
as well as um in addition to
you know who he killed too
i mean because of that
its pretty hard for us to be um
objective
yeah thats it objective
you know since we knew the two
alleged people involved and everything
and whereas we might be upset
this morning or something
you know were not because of
the fact that were not objective at all
i also play guitar by the way
you dont even know what a friend is
im tired
you call samson a friend
dont i get a phone call
enough of a friend to cover up for
help him hide the body maybe
maybe even help him kill the poor girl
i didnt kill nobody
did he tell you why he did it
werent you even curious
did you even give a flying fuck
these are stupid questions i know
my rights i know i get a phone call
you dont have any rights just yet layne
we havent arrested you
great see you
ok
ok ok
go make your phone call
go call one of your precious friends
i asked you a question
i didnt know her ok
i just want to say
it was horrible what those kids did
and the incident points up a fundamental
moral breakdown in our society
thank you kevin for your
insightful selfrighteous indignation
id still like to hear from tom
just quit staring at me like that man
clarissa
sorry im late
you knew jamie right
you were one of her friends
describe to us how you remember her
remember her
yeah what she looked like
what she meant to you
youre bullshit what gives you the right
to put clarissa on the spot like that
i mean shes upset man
her friend is dead
are you upset clarissa
are you i mean if you are
come on lets get it off your chest
fuck you
why dont you just leave her alone
no fuck you man
because i dont buy it
you dont give a damn
i dont give a damn nobody in this
classroom gives a damn that she is dead
it gives us a chance to feel superior
and to point up a fundamental
moral breakdown in society
but it doesnt really affect us does it
because if it did none of us would
be in this classroom right now
wed be out on the street
halfcrazy from lack of sleep
hunting down samson toulette
with a gun
thats a reprehensible attitude
just shut up kevin
are we gonna be tested on this shit

lecturing us about what monsters we are
i cant handle much more
i say we split got just the place too
