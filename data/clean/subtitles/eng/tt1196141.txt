g reg

what are you doing get up
mom and dad have been calling you
for an hour
youre about to be late for
your first day of middle school
what
oh geez how did that happen
go go go moms about to flip out
she sent me to get you
while she waits in the car
what are you doing whats going on
getting ready for
school
are you insane
school doesnt start till next week
and fyi school doesnt start
at 400 in the morning
you woke up manny
and if he doesnt go back down
good morning
there is no way he is going back down
i just wanted to sleep till 600
bubby
go to bed i got him
greg what are you doing up
making all this noise
it was rodrick he woke me up
he changed my clock
but i swear he was just
go to bed
what is that smell
i cant even identify it
bubby
happy birthday
here bubby
wow look at the size
of that flamethrower
okay first of all
let me get something straight
this is a journal not a diary
yeah i know what it says on the cover
but when my mom went out
to buy this thing
i specifically told her
not to buy one that said diary on it
this just proves mom doesnt understand
anything about kids my age
sissy
the only reason i agreed to
write in this thing is because
when im rich and famous
ill have better things to do
than answer peoples stupid questions
all day long
gregory tell us about your childhood
were you always so smart and handsome
heres my journal now shoo shoo
thats our boy up there
why did i ever say no to him
mom got me this thing
so i could write down my feelings
about starting middle school
but im gonna be fine
its my best friend rowley jefferson
im worried about
hes definitely not middle school ready
geronimo
hes not quite clear
on the concept of growing up
i want a puppy a kitty
a gumball machine
but anyway this is about me not rowley
i always figured
theyd make a movie about my life
but i didnt think
theyd start the story here
because seriously
who wants to see a movie about a kid
whos stuck in middle school
with a bunch of morons
three days no shower smell the love
let me go rodrick
come on
were just having some fun right
no okay so look
mom asked me to give you some advice
about middle school
its real simple
dont talk to anyone dont look at anyone
dont go anywhere
dont sit down dont raise your hand
dont go to the bathroom
dont get noticed
dont choose the wrong locker dont
who am i kidding
youll be dead or homeschooled
by the end of the year anyway
and dont be seen with rowley
manny stop it mom
thanks for the eggs mom
frank
g reg
i think its gross and undignified
that i have to eat breakfast
next to him on the potty
okay well its your fault
hes still potty training
dont look down manny
the potty monster doesnt like it
when you look at him
i was just joking with him
okay kiss him youre sorry
and then lets get a move on
cant be late for your first day of school
let me just say for the record
that i think middle school may be
the dumbest idea ever invented
you got kids like me
who havent hit their growth spurt yet
mixed in with gorillas
who have to shave twice a day
theres juvenile delinquents and weirdos
im smaller than about
95 of the kids at my school
give it back stop
so thank god for chirag gupta
its mine stop
can i have the backpack
you got to jump higher
its not yours
hes an excellent buffer
between me and these morons
hey greg
hey fella
seriously i dont know what happened
to these kids over the summer
was there a nuclear accident
science experiment gone bad
thank god there are a few normal people
or this place would be a total freak show
if youre as discriminating as i am
it can be tough to figure out where to sit
on your first day of middle school
one bad move
and youre stuck next to some idiot
for the rest of the year
greg
remember how i said
rowley wasnt middle school ready
well there you go
what are you wearing
my family just got back from guatemala
its my serape
nice huh
all right class im mrs flint
everybody take your seats
welcome to your first day
of middle school
remember your seats
youll be sitting here every day
rowley if you had to say
where you were ranked
in terms of popularity from one to 200
where would you put yourself
is 200 good or bad
id say youre somewhere
around the 154 mark
id put myself around number 19 or 20
i might even have a shot at the top spot
by the end of the year
if things go the way i think they will
well whos at the bottom
hey guys wanna see my secret freckle
fregley sent home for hygiene issues
at least once a month
check it out its got a hair in it
what color is that
you wanna help me name it
all right ladies gather around
come on put the knitting down lets go
all right everybody
im coach malone
and i am your gym teacher
pe is as much a part of my life
as waking up in the morning
and going to the bathroom
i live and breathe physical education
now whos with me
are you ready to have some fun out there
yeah
all right outstanding
so were gonna divide you up
into two teams
so you two over here
you you you this way
yeah you three this side good
you guys are going to be shirts
and you will be skins
why are we skins i hate this
hes just trying to make
kids like us feel bad
what do you mean kids like us
i just dont want to get a sunburn
right rowley
my name is bell e button
whats yours
okay lets start off with a little game
i like to call gladiator
i got this one
no
take that
cover me
oh god
not good
were never going to be able
to outrun these guys
we dont have to outrun them
we just have to outrun chirag
think they saw us
no way
they were focused on
getting that kid with the limp
well hide here for the rest of the class
because im not playing that game
its not fair
hes got all the neanderthals
on the same team its barbaric
its completely barbaric
this place is an intellectual wasteland
but you know its nice to meet someone
more interested in his mind
than in his body
you girls get to jump rope
what are you doing hiding
avoiding the pain
it all starts in middle school you know
youre not a kid any more
the coddling has stopped
kids are now separated by intelligence
the weak are picked on
and girls youve known since kindergarten
wont even talk to you any more
okay well
sounds like you got it all figured out
so go back to your book
this place is a glorified holding pen
all the way all the way
youre like a machine
its where adults put you
as you make that awkward transition
between child and teenager
so they dont even have to look at you
hi im angie
great story were gonna go now
why this is a good spot
its a perfect spot
i survived all of the sixth grade here
and i would enjoy
some likeminded company
to get me through the seventh
is that the whistle
i think i hear the whistle
we need to go
no showboating all right
why are we leaving
we could get killed out here in the open
put your shirt on
theyll think were on their team
besides getting crushed is better than
being seen with that freak job
trust me you cant recover
from social suicide
i never talked to a girl that long before
whoa
check that out
isthatcheese
stop
good god man
you almost got the cheese touch
the what
the cheese touch
nobody knows when or how
but one day that cheese
mysteriously appeared on the blacktop
nobody knew who it belonged to
nobody touched it nobody threw it away
and so there it sat
growing more foul
and powerful by the day
then one day a kid named darren walsh
made the biggest mistake of his life
darren touched the cheese
no i didnt i just looked at it really
darren had the cheese touch
it was worse than nuclear cooties
he became an outcast
the only way to get rid of
the cheese touch
was by passing it on to someone else
and so began the cheese touch frenzy
friend turning on friend
brother turning on sister
it was madness
until a german exchange student
named dieter muller took it away
dieter has the cheese touch
ze cheese touch
vat is it
vat does it mean ze cheese touch
sadly for dieter
that fact was lost in translation
nooooooooo
thankfully he moved back to dusseldorf
and took the cheese touch with him
and so the cheese sits
patiently waiting for its next victim
this is a terrible place
no doors
none
im not pooping until im in high school
the cafeteria
possibly the cruelest place on earth
but i was about to make some kids day
by sitting next to him
that seats saved
for who
its saved
that ones saved too
so not happening
taken
where are we supposed to eat
i guess this is
where all the cool guys hang out
fregley must have bumped his head
when he was little like really hard
okay okay
so my first day could have gone better
but at least i wasnt humiliated
hey greg
you want to come over and play
what did he just say to you
i think my rides here
hey guys so this guy says to that guy
you wanna come over and play
yeah do you guys wanna play with us
see this is the problem
right now i have to take abuse
from these morons
but in 20 years
quentin here will be working for me
greg please dont fire me
i really need my measly pathetic job
scooping your dogs poop
whatever ill think about it
no no no vanilla on the bottom
and chocolate on the top
i cant eat this
play rowley play
ive told you like a billion times that
guys our age say hang out not play
seriously if youre not gonna
listen to me just tell me
cause if you pull another stunt like that
well be stuck on the cafeteria floor
for the rest of middle school
i found half a snickers bar down there
i cant be the guy who eats off his lap
in the cafeteria
i should be
at the top of the food chain by now
somethings got to change fast
my mom told me to just be myself
and people would like me
that would be good advice
if you were somebody else
hey little brother
was your first day as crappy
as i said it would be
no not at all you were wrong
it was actually better than i
worse
you didnt listen to me did you
i told you not to talk look
or go anywhere and what happened
he had to eat his lunch on the floor
rowley
perfect
and if nobody wants you
sitting at their table
you think they want
chummy buttons over here
i was right youre not even gonna
make it out of there alive
the only chance you have
of making the yearbook is
when they dedicate it to your memory
so you wanna play twisted wizard
no i have a better idea
if he catches you in
here he will kill you
literally kill you
dont worry
as long as we hear the music were okay
whoa yeah wow
i didnt know rodrick
was into motorcycles
i found it
found what
rodricks middle school yearbook
this thing holds all the answers
rowley this thing is like a bible
see this this is where
a person like me needs to be
the class favorites
theyre the best in their class
these people arent nobodies
theyre famous
they dont have to worry about
getting a seat in the cafeteria either
check this out
theres tons of things i qualify for
most likely to succeed best looking
class clown
they should just
give that to me right now
dont you have to be funny for that
hey we could try for cutest friends
what did i tell you would happen
if you ever went in my room again
but your band is still playing
its the bass solo turd burglar
dont you know anything about music
now i came up here
to get a new drumstick
and now greg

i just came in here to take a shower
hes lying he was gonna kill me
cause i was in his room
and so you peed on him
yes i mean no i mean
yes
theres a lot to sign up for
you could be class favorite

i cant believe all these activities
theyre all so much work
staying after school
meeting before school on weekends
what kind of extracurricular activities
are these
out of my way
who let you into this school greg heffley
i was thinking the same thing about you
patty farrell
you listen to me greg heffley
im running for student council president
and im warning you
if you get in my way i will beat you up
just like i did in kindergarten
and fourth grade
fourth grade that one was ugly
whats her problem
what did i ever do to her
patty patty is a fatty
has a face just like a ratty
come on that was pretty funny
she needs to get a sense of humor
and i need something to make me
a class favorite
what about class favorites
dont you ever say hi or hello
before you start talking
hi
hello
gregs only here because
he really wants to be something
rowleyl
i was just saying that
i would really like to nail these people
because its so obvious that
theyre only doing these activities
to get in the yearbook
you know i like your point of view
you should sign up for the school paper
were the voice of the people
well the people are mostly idiots
so i guess technically speaking
were the voice of the people
making fun of the people
thanks but i cant be on the paper
because im gonna be in the paper a lot
so that would be a conflict of interest
youre the people got it
do you believe me now
that girl is crazy town
look they have wrestling
thats it im great at wrestling
ive watched it for years
i know all the moves
tombstone piledriver
chair shot
vader bomb
hefﬂey hefﬂey hefﬂey hefﬂey
h efﬂey h efﬂey h efﬂey
okay something is very wrong here
these dont look like
wrestling costumes to me
welcome to wrestling
you future olympians
so just to make sure
we all get off on the right foot
and nobody gets seriously injured
were gonna teach you a few basic moves
remember this is about
learning the sport and having fun
all right its not a competition

weirdest kid in school
nobodys ever gonna let me
sit at their table
how are you going to beat him
its like he had superhuman strength
im not gonna beat him
im gonna gain 10 pounds this week
so i can move up to
the bulldog weight class
and then you and i can wrestle each other
ready
can i throw at you now
later
youre better at riding than i am
and im a better thrower
greg save some for everybody else
honey
cant i need to bulk up
vvhy
i think your body looks beautiful
just the way it is
i heard he got his butt kicked at wrestling
now what is wrong with you
why would you sign up for something
you dont have to do
you signed up for wrestling
kind of
you never sign up for anything at school
you fly below the radar
that way you never raise
anyones expectations
thank you rodrick
for those words of motivational wisdom
but perhaps
a better way to look at it is that
its a chance
to learn to excel at something
well what could i learn at school
that i cant teach myself
well greg i think its great that
you took the initiative
to learn something new
this is like the first
step to responsibility
my bosss son will was smaller than you
but he built himself up with the weights
yeah
we could get you the same equipment
you could train
get the right nutrition cardio
youd be in tiptop shape just like will
and it would only take like three months
three months
yeah
ill just stick to eating
well i dont know
where you put it heffley
but you gained 10 pounds
and joined the bulldog class
yes
i thought
you didnt gain any weight this week
my moms ankle weights
all right bulldog heffley
meet your new opponent
what but this is boys wrestling
ever hear of title ix
her parents threatened to sue
so you show her
what its like to wrestle a real live boy
come on what you waiting for
dont be such a wuss heffley
make your move
shes a girl where do i grab her
stay down
patty over here
get off of me
can i wrestle somebody good now
well look whos in the paper
greg youre famous
right on the front page
and if i would have pinned her
which i could have done easily
you know i would have gotten in trouble
for hurting a girl
why does she even want to wrestle
who knows girls are very confusing
like today
i heard someone in the hallway say
that bryce anderson has a cute butt
what does that even mean
a butt cant be cute its a butt
i know but thats what they were saying
i dont see why girls our age
cant talk just like regular people
so how are you gonna become
a class favorite now
two words best dressed
how are you going to do that
fashion is easy you wear a shirt
and a tie and kids are impressed
im telling you this is gonna work
i told you i was wearing this
i know
i wanted to be matchers
check them out
greg and rowley sitting in a tree
kissing
first comes love
you know
maybe rodrick was right about rowley
maybe i do need a new best friend
but i cant just ditch him
i mean if anybody has a better idea
id love to hear it
in this school much like your own
one boy is about to learn
an important lesson
about selfworth and esteem
gag me with a spoon
that guy is so unpopular
id hate to be him
why doesnt anybody like me
maybe because they dont know
how awesome you really are
brock branigan p i
what are you doing here
im here to solve the case of the boy
who just needed to be himself
so go for it
show them how awesome you really are
hey guys do you like break dancing
that is totally rad
wicked
you should sit with us at lunch friend
sweet
it really is awesome to be me
thanks brock
okay lets talk about what weve learned
i dont know about anyone else
but i know what i learned
it is awesome to be me
the problem with rowley
is that hes not enough like me
i cant ditch him
cause hed be lost without me
but maybe i can fix him
because thats the kind of friend i am
what are you doing
making your clothes
more middleschool friendly
look at this stuff too babyish and weird
too why dont you just punch me now
what are you a foreign exchange student
man this one we burn
that was a present from my mom
well then your mom
is trying to get you killed
ready steady go
no no no
you look like one of the seven dwarfs
you only need one strap one strap is cool
but theres two straps
why would they put on two straps
if youre only supposed to use one
because the guys who make backpacks
arent cool
if they were cool theyd give it one
strap like the cool onestrap guys do
you know what has one strap
machine guns
you know what else electric guitars
you know what else
purses
but joshie is cool
rowley joshie is not cool
hes a lipsynching pop star
whose fans are eightyearold girls
youre just jealous
that i was the one who discovered him
who are you gonna listen to rowley
me or joshie
joshie says to respect your parents
and follow your dreams
then joshie must get beaten up a lot
you actually almost look as good as me
am i great at this or what
theres bryce anderson just be cool
hey bryce
yeah hey bryce
cute butt
youre killing me you know that
look rowley tonights halloween

youre kidding me right
my mom wanted me to be visible at night
from space
so well hit a few houses
on the way to the north side
which is where well do
most of our trickortreating
why are we going all the way over there
its where the rich people live
they hand out like two three pieces
of big candy to each kid
not that candy corn crap
im talking about fullsize
milky ways and nutter butters
plus if we time it right
rich people get tired of answering
their doors and just leave the bowl out
we can clean up
youre lucky
my mom doesnt let me play
with makeup any more
shut up tool
léded dipers got a gig tonight
going to the north side huh
takes you right past
the devil worshiper woods
the devil worshiper woods
you know about that story right
well there used to be this house
right here where these woods are
they had to tear it down because
what happened there was so terrible
what happened there
well a long time ago
two kids who were i dont know
maybe in middle school
they trickortreated at that house
on halloween night
but the house was full of devil worshipers
who put the kids
in these giant pizza ovens
and they cooked them and they ate them
but they forgot to turn off the ovens
so the house burned down
with everyone in it
howd the trees get there
and then they planted trees
and to this day on halloween night
you can still hear the demonic laughter
of the devil worshiper ghosts
as they roam the woods
looking for more kids to sacrifice

sorry safety patrol only
sorry
you rejected the school paper
but you joined the safety patrol
look are you working
your way down the evolutionary ladder

is the lowest of the low
the geekiest of the geeky
the island of misfit toys
youre just jealous they dont trust you
to keep our school safe
now if youll excuse me
i need to secure the perimeter
im hungry
keep it straight people
singlefile line one by one

rowleys pretty lucky

my dad got me a weightlifting set

twisted wizard two at your house

you got rowley a card
what no its for bryan little
you know the guy who writes
the wacky dawg cartoons

so just out of curiosity
whos gonna do the cartoon
theyre having tryouts but
the important thing is bryan gets better
absolutely
bryan little getting mono was destiny
i draw cartoons all the time
im gonna win this
i decided to go ahead and forgive rowley
for milking the broken hand so hard
and i told him

hey fella
wow everyone knows me now
its like im famous isnt this great
yeah
rowley jefferson
i need to see you in my office now
i just took a call from a mrs irvine
about what happened
to the kindergarteners last week
she was very upset and so am i
what
you violated the sacred trust
this
this badge is supposed to mean
something and you just spat on it
i can barely even look at you
i really dont
just save it
you are officially suspended
from safety patrol
and i expect a full apology
to the kindergarteners
yes sir
hey what did he have to say
im kicked off
i dont even know what hes talking about
rowley
what
nothing
youve been home for an hour
and havent badgered me for any snacks
are you feeling okay
well im kind of in a tough situation
i know something
and if i tell the truth about it
it could hurt somebody
but if i dont it could
hurt somebody else
well you have to trust your gut
and try to do the right thing
because its our choices
that make us who we are
okay
i was up all night tossing and turning
thinking about my moms advice
and i finally decided
to do the right thing
im sorry i terrorized you children
what
i decided to let rowley
take one for the team
but im not entirely sure
that was the right call
hey hows it going
well i was pretty upset
about being suspended from safety patrol
but then i just started drawing a bunch
of zoowee mamas and i felt better
look i put you in this weeks cartoon
and you even get to say
zoowee mama
wow thats really
nice
so listen
its kind of funny you know
the whole safety patrol thing
yeah
ready for the funny part
well im the one
who terrorized those kids
what
yeah
and i think we can both learn
some valuable lessons from this
like i should be more careful what i do
in front of mrs lrines house
and you well
you should be more careful
who you lend your coat to
you know what greg
youre not a good friend
whoa how could you even say that
im a great friend
if you were a great friend
you would have told mr winsky the truth
okay one thing
you cant get mad aboutjust
you only care about yourself
you hated my cartoon
you made fun of my clothes
you disrespected joshie
you broke my hand
and you didnt even seem sorry
that broken hand was the best thing
that ever happened to you
dont call me
dont come by my house were done
i thought the whole thing would blow over
but rowley was still giving me
the silent treatment
even when i tried to make the first move
yeah
so anyway i was so angry at him
one of the kindergarteners
finally told their parents the whole story
greg youre relieved of your safety patrol
duties effective immediately
rowley
for showing dignity under false suspicion
i am promoting you
to team captain
now thats a position that i held
for two years i know youll honor it
hey rowley my mom says its okay
for me to sleep over tonight

the whole thing with rowley is
i was willing to let bygones be bygones
but then he made friends with collin
just to mess with me

well you know what
two can play at that game
