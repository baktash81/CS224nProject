  g reg 
  what 
what are you doing  get up 
mom and dad have been calling you
for an hour 
you re about to be late for
your first day of middle school 
what 
oh  geez  how did that happen 
go  go  go  mom s about to flip out 
she sent me to get you
while she waits in the car 
what are you doing  what s going on 
getting ready for   
  school 
are you insane 
school doesn t start till next week 
and  fyi  school doesn t start
at 4 00 in the morning 
you woke up manny 
and if he doesn t go back down   
good morning 
there is no way he is going back down 
i just wanted to sleep till 6 00 
  bubby 
  go to bed  i got him 
greg  what are you doing up
making all this noise 
it was rodrick  he woke me up 
he changed my clock 
  but i swear  he was just   
  go to bed 
what is that smell 
i can t even identify it 
bubby 
happy birthday 
here  bubby 
wow  look at the size
of that flamethrower 
okay  first of all 
let me get something straight 
this is a journal  not a diary 
yeah  i know what it says on the cover 
but when my mom went out
to buy this thing 
i specifically told her
not to buy one that said  diary  on it 
this just proves mom doesn t understand
anything about kids my age 
sissy 
the only reason i agreed to
write in this thing is because
when i m rich and famous
i ll have better things to do
than answer people s stupid questions
all day long 
gregory  tell us about your childhood 
were you always so smart and handsome 
here s my journal  now  shoo  shoo 
that s our boy up there 
why did i ever say no to him 
mom got me this thing
so i could write down my feelings
about starting middle school 
but i m gonna be fine 
it s my best friend  rowley jefferson 
i m worried about 
he s definitely not middle school ready 
geronimo 
he s not quite clear
on the concept of growing up 
i want a puppy  a kitty 
a gumball machine   
but anyway  this is about me  not rowley 
i always figured
they d make a movie about my life 
but i didn t think
they d start the story here 
because  seriously 
who wants to see a movie about a kid
who s stuck in middle school
with a bunch of morons 
three days  no shower  smell the love 
let me go  rodrick 
come on 
we re just having some fun  right 
no  okay  so  look 
mom asked me to give you some advice
about middle school 
it s real simple 
don t talk to anyone  don t look at anyone 
don t go anywhere 
don t sit down  don t raise your hand 
don t go to the bathroom 
don t get noticed 
don t choose the wrong locker  don t   
who am i kidding 
you ll be dead or homeschooled
by the end of the year  anyway 
and don t be seen with rowley 
manny  stop it  mom 
thanks for the eggs  mom 
  frank 
  g reg 
i think it s gross and undignified
that i have to eat breakfast
next to him on the potty 
okay  well  it s your fault
he s still potty training 
don t look down  manny 
the potty monster doesn t like it
when you look at him 
i was just joking with him 
okay  kiss him you re sorry
and then let s get a move on 
can t be late for your first day of school 
let me just say for the record
that i think middle school may be
the dumbest idea ever invented 
you got kids like me
who haven t hit their growth spurt yet
mixed in with gorillas
who have to shave twice a day 
there s juvenile delinquents and weirdos 
i m smaller than about
95  of the kids at my school   
give it back  stop 
so thank god for chirag gupta 
  it s mine  stop 
  can i have the backpack 
  you got to jump higher 
  it s not yours 
he s an excellent buffer
between me and these morons 
hey  greg 
hey  fella 
seriously  i don t know what happened
to these kids over the summer 
was there a nuclear accident 
science experiment gone bad 
thank god there are a few normal people
or this place would be a total freak show 
if you re as discriminating as i am 
it can be tough to figure out where to sit
on your first day of middle school 
one bad move
and you re stuck next to some idiot
for the rest of the year 
greg 
remember how i said
rowley wasn t middle school ready 
well  there you go 
what are you wearing 
my family just got back from guatemala 
it s my serape 
nice  huh 
all right  class  i m mrs  flint 
everybody take your seats 
welcome to your first day
of middle school 
remember your seats 
you ll be sitting here every day 
rowley  if you had to say
where you were ranked
in terms of popularity from one to 200 
where would you put yourself 
is 200 good or bad 
i d say you re somewhere
around the 154 mark 
i d put myself around number 19 or 20 
i might even have a shot at the top spot
by the end of the year 
if things go the way i think they will 
well  who s at the bottom 
hey  guys  wanna see my secret freckle 
fregley  sent home for hygiene issues
at least once a month 
check it out  it s got a hair in it 
what color is that 
you wanna help me name it 
all right  ladies  gather around 
come on  put the knitting down  let s go 
all right  everybody 
i m coach malone
and i am your gym teacher 
p e  is as much a part of my life
as waking up in the morning
and going to the bathroom 
i live and breathe physical education 
now  who s with me 
are you ready to have some fun out there 
yeah 
all right  outstanding 
so we re gonna divide you up
into two teams 
so you two  over here 
you  you  you  this way 
yeah  you three  this side  good 
you guys are going to be shirts 
and you will be skins 
why are we skins  i hate this 
he s just trying to make
kids like us feel bad 
what do you mean  kids like us 
i just don t want to get a sunburn 
right  rowley 
my name is bell e  button 
what s yours 
okay  let s start off with a little game
i like to call gladiator 
  i got this one 
  no 
take that 
cover me 
oh  god 
not good 
we re never going to be able
to outrun these guys 
we don t have to outrun them 
we just have to outrun chirag 
  think they saw us 
  no way 
they were focused on
getting that kid with the limp 
we ll hide here for the rest of the class
because i m not playing that game 
it s not fair 
he s got all the neanderthals
on the same team  it s barbaric 
it s completely barbaric 
this place is an intellectual wasteland 
but  you know  it s nice to meet someone
more interested in his mind
than in his body 
you girls get to jump rope 
what are you doing hiding 
avoiding the pain 
it all starts in middle school  you know 
you re not a kid any more 
the coddling has stopped 
kids are now separated by intelligence 
the weak are picked on 
and girls you ve known since kindergarten
won t even talk to you any more 
okay  well 
sounds like you got it all figured out 
so go back to your book 
this place is a glorified holding pen 
all the way  all the way 
you re like a machine 
it s where adults put you
as you make that awkward transition
between child and teenager
so they don t even have to look at you 
hi  i m angie 
great story  we re gonna go now 
why  this is a good spot 
it s a perfect spot 
i survived all of the sixth grade here 
and i would enjoy
some like minded company
to get me through the seventh 
is that the whistle 
i think i hear the whistle 
we need to go 
no showboating  all right 
why are we leaving 
we could get killed out here in the open 
put your shirt on 
they ll think we re on their team 
besides  getting crushed is better than
being seen with that freak job 
trust me  you can t recover
from social suicide 
i never talked to a girl that long before 
whoa 
check that out 
isthatcheese 
stop 
good god  man 
you almost got the cheese touch 
  the what 
  the cheese touch 
nobody knows when or how 
but one day that cheese
mysteriously appeared on the blacktop 
nobody knew who it belonged to 
nobody touched it  nobody threw it away 
and so there it sat 
growing more foul
and powerful by the day 
then one day  a kid named darren walsh
made the biggest mistake of his life 
darren touched the cheese 
no  i didn t  i just looked at it  really 
darren had the cheese touch 
it was worse than nuclear cooties 
he became an outcast 
the only way to get rid of
the cheese touch
was by passing it on to someone else 
and so began the cheese touch frenzy 
friend turning on friend 
brother turning on sister 
it was madness 
until a german exchange student
named dieter muller took it away 
dieter has the cheese touch 
ze cheese touch 
vat is it 
vat does it mean  ze cheese touch  
sadly for dieter 
that fact was lost in translation 
nooooooooo    
thankfully  he moved back to dusseldorf
and took the cheese touch with him 
and so the cheese sits 
patiently waiting for its next victim 
this is a terrible place 
  no doors 
  none 
i m not pooping until i m in high school 
the cafeteria 
possibly the cruelest place on earth 
but i was about to make some kid s day
by sitting next to him 
that seat s saved 
for who 
it s saved 
that one s saved  too 
so not happening 
taken 
where are we supposed to eat 
i guess this is
where all the cool guys hang out 
fregley must have bumped his head
when he was little  like  really hard 
okay  okay 
so my first day could have gone better 
but at least i wasn t humiliated 
hey  greg 
you want to come over and play 
what did he just say to you 
i think my ride s here 
hey  guys  so this guy says to that guy 
 you wanna come over and play   
yeah  do you guys wanna play with us 
see  this is the problem 
right now i have to take abuse
from these morons 
but in 20 years 
quentin here will be working for me 
greg  please don t fire me 
i really need my measly  pathetic job
scooping your dog s poop 
whatever  i ll think about it 
no  no  no  vanilla on the bottom
and chocolate on the top 
i can t eat this 
play   rowley   play  
i ve told you  like  a billion times that
guys our age say  hang out   not  play  
seriously  if you re not gonna
listen to me  just tell me 
 cause if you pull another stunt like that 
we ll be stuck on the cafeteria floor
for the rest of middle school 
i found half a snickers bar down there 
i can t be the guy who eats off his lap
in the cafeteria 
i should be
at the top of the food chain by now 
something s got to change  fast 
my mom told me to just be myself
and people would like me 
that would be good advice
if you were somebody else 
hey  little brother 
was your first day as crappy
as i said it would be 
no  not at all  you were wrong 
  it was actually better than i   
  worse 
you didn t listen to me  did you 
i told you not to talk  look
or go anywhere  and what happened 
he had to eat his lunch on the floor 
  rowley 
  perfect 
and if nobody wants you
sitting at their table 
you think they want
chummy buttons over here 
i was right  you re not even gonna
make it out of there alive 
the only chance you have
of making the yearbook is
when they dedicate it to your memory 
so you wanna play twisted wizard 
no  i have a better idea 
if he catches you in
here  he will kill you 
literally  kill you 
don t worry 
as long as we hear the music  we re okay 
whoa  yeah  wow 
i didn t know rodrick
was into motorcycles 
  i found it 
  found what 
rodrick s middle school yearbook 
this thing holds all the answers 
rowley  this thing is like a bible 
see this  this is where
a person like me needs to be 
the class favorites 
they re the best in their class 
these people aren t nobodies 
they re famous 
they don t have to worry about
getting a seat in the cafeteria  either 
check this out 
there s tons of things i qualify for 
 most likely to succeed    best looking  
 class clown  
they should just
give that to me right now 
don t you have to be funny for that 
hey  we could try for cutest friends 
what did i tell you would happen
if you ever went in my room again 
but your band is still playing 
it s the bass solo  turd burglar 
don t you know anything about music 
now  i came up here
to get a new drumstick 
and now  greg 
since mom and dad are gone 
i m going to kill you  literally  kill you 
i told you 
beat it 
okay  but i just want to say one thing 
  run  greg  run 
  what 
let go  baby hipp  
you re gonna have to come out
sometime  loser 
i ll wait here as long as it takes 
and then  you re dead 
time out  rodrick  i have to pee 
no time outs  only death 
  but i really have to go 
  don t care 
move over  i m dying 
got you 
greg  did you throw manny off his   
what is going on 
greg started it 
i just came in here to take a shower 
he s lying  he was gonna kill me
 cause i was in his room 
and so you peed on him 
yes  i mean  no  i mean   
yes 
there s a lot to sign up for 
you could be class favorite
in a bunch of things 
jazz dancing 
we could do that one together 
i can t believe all these activities 
they re all so much work 
staying after school 
meeting before school  on weekends 
what kind of extracurricular activities
are these 
out of my way 
who let you into this school  greg heffley 
i was thinking the same thing about you 
patty farrell 
you listen to me  greg heffley 
i m running for student council president
and i m warning you 
if you get in my way  i will beat you up 
just like i did in kindergarten
and fourth grade 
fourth grade  that one was ugly 
what s her problem 
what did i ever do to her 
patty  patty is a fatty 
has a face just like a ratty 
come on  that was pretty funny 
she needs to get a sense of humor 
and i need something to make me
a class favorite 
what about class favorites 
don t you ever say hi or hello
before you start talking 
  hi 
  hello 
greg s only here because
he really wants to be something   
rowleyl
i was just saying that
i would really like to nail these people
because it s so obvious that
they re only doing these activities
to get in the yearbook 
you know  i like your point of view 
you should sign up for the school paper 
we re the voice of the people 
well  the people are mostly idiots 
so i guess  technically speaking 
we re the voice of the people
making fun of the people 
thanks  but i can t be on the paper
because i m gonna be in the paper a lot 
so that would be a conflict of interest 
you re the people  got it 
do you believe me now 
that girl is crazy town 
look  they have wrestling 
that s it  i m great at wrestling 
i ve watched it for years 
i know all the moves 
tombstone piledriver 
chair shot 
vader bomb 
hefﬂey  hefﬂey  hefﬂey  hefﬂey 
h efﬂey  h efﬂey  h efﬂey 
okay  something is very wrong here 
these don t look like
wrestling costumes to me 
welcome to wrestling 
you future olympians 
so  just to make sure
we all get off on the right foot
and nobody gets seriously injured 
we re gonna teach you a few basic moves 
remember  this is about
learning the sport and having fun 
all right  it s not a competition
because everyone here
is already a superstar to me 
coach brewer  can you step over here
for a moment 
please  give me a hand  thanks 
that s known as a speed takedown 
nice job  coach brewer 
can you get up and come behind me 
put one arm over my shoulder 
let s go  yeah 
you got it  walk it off  come on 
that was known as the arm drag 
let s give coach brewer a hand 
everybody 
he s fine 
yeah  heffley 
what about piledrivers and vader bombs 
that is fake wrestling 
this is real wrestling  let s go 
if i have to wrestle benny wells 
he ll kill me 
let s move  come on 
okay  to keep things fair  i ve divided you
into weight categories by your size 
so rottweilers over here 
bulldogs  you stay right there 
and we got two 
chihuahuas  yeah 
nice head gear 
thanks  my mom let me borrow it 
all right  let s see what you got 
don t worry  fregley 
i ll take it easy on you 
hey  i wasn t ready 
nobody s keeping score  but that was
a sweet speed takedown  fregley 
this is fun  greg hefﬂey 
get off me 
  fregleyl fregleyl fregleyl 
  fregleyl fregleyl fregleyl 
blow the whistle  blow the whistle 
all right  fregleyl 
outstanding 
and let s   
let s hear it for our other winner 
yay  greg 
i can t lose to fregley again 
if i get beat by the
weirdest kid in school 
nobody s ever gonna let me
sit at their table 
how are you going to beat him 
it s like he had superhuman strength 
i m not gonna beat him 
i m gonna gain 10 pounds this week
so i can move up to
the bulldog weight class 
and then you and i can wrestle each other 
ready 
  can i throw at you now 
  later 
you re better at riding than i am 
and i m a better thrower 
greg  save some for everybody else 
honey 
can t  i need to bulk up 
vvhy 
i think your body looks beautiful
just the way it is 
i heard he got his butt kicked at wrestling 
now what is wrong with you 
why would you sign up for something
you don t have to do 
you signed up for wrestling 
kind of 
you never sign up for anything at school 
you fly below the radar 
that way you never raise
anyone s expectations 
thank you  rodrick 
for those words of motivational wisdom 
but perhaps
a better way to look at it is that
it s a chance
to learn to excel at something 
well  what could i learn at school
that i can t teach myself 
well  greg  i think it s great that
you took the initiative
to learn something new 
this is like the first
step to responsibility 
my boss s son will was smaller than you 
but he built himself up with the weights 
yeah 
we could get you the same equipment 
you could train 
get the right nutrition  cardio 
you d be in tip top shape just like will 
and it would only take  like  three months 
  three months 
  yeah 
i ll just stick to eating 
well  i don t know
where you put it  heffley 
but you gained 10 pounds
and joined the bulldog class 
yes 
i thought
you didn t gain any weight this week 
my mom s ankle weights 
all right  bulldog heffley 
meet your new opponent 
what  but this is boys  wrestling 
ever hear of title ix 
her parents threatened to sue 
so you show her
what it s like to wrestle a real live boy 
come on  what you waiting for 
don t be such a wuss  heffley 
  make your move 
  she s a girl  where do i grab her 
  stay down 
  patty  over here 
  get off of me 
  can i wrestle somebody good now 
well  look who s in the paper 
greg  you re famous 
right on the front page 
and if i would have pinned her 
which i could have done easily 
you know i would have gotten in trouble
for hurting a girl 
why does she even want to wrestle 
who knows  girls are very confusing 
like today 
i heard someone in the hallway say
that bryce anderson has a cute butt 
what does that even mean 
a butt can t be cute  it s a butt 
i know  but that s what they were saying 
i don t see why girls our age
can t talk just like regular people 
so how are you gonna become
a class favorite now 
  two words  best dressed 
  how are you going to do that 
fashion is easy  you wear a shirt
and a tie  and kids are impressed 
i m telling you  this is gonna work 
  i told you i was wearing this 
  i know 
  i wanted to be matchers 
  check them out 
greg and rowley sitting in a tree 
k i s s i n g
first comes love   
you know 
maybe rodrick was right about rowley 
maybe i do need a new best friend 
but i can t just ditch him 
i mean  if anybody has a better idea 
i d love to hear it 
in this school  much like your own 
one boy is about to learn
an important lesson
about self worth and esteem 
gag me with a spoon 
that guy is so unpopular 
i d hate to be him 
why doesn t anybody like me 
maybe because they don t know
how awesome you really are 
brock branigan p  i  
what are you doing here 
i m here to solve the case of the boy
who just needed to be himself 
so go for it 
show them how awesome you really are 
hey  guys  do you like break dancing 
that is totally rad 
wicked 
you should sit with us at lunch  friend 
sweet 
it really is awesome to be me 
thanks  brock 
okay  let s talk about what we ve learned 
i don t know about anyone else 
but i know what i learned 
it is awesome to be me 
the problem with rowley
is that he s not enough like me 
i can t ditch him
 cause he d be lost without me 
but maybe i can fix him 
because that s the kind of friend i am 
what are you doing 
making your clothes
more middle school friendly 
look at this stuff  too babyish and weird 
too  why don t you just punch me now   
what are you  a foreign exchange student 
man  this one we burn 
that was a present from my mom 
well  then your mom
is trying to get you killed 
ready  steady  go 
no  no  no 
you look like one of the seven dwarfs 
you only need one strap  one strap is cool 
but there s two straps 
why would they put on two straps
if you re only supposed to use one 
because the guys who make backpacks
aren t cool 
if they were cool  they d give it one
strap  like the cool one strap guys do 
you know what has one strap 
machine guns 
you know what else  electric guitars 
  you know what else 
  purses 
  but joshie is cool 
  rowley  joshie is not cool 
he s a lip synching pop star
whose fans are eight year old girls 
you re just jealous
that i was the one who discovered him 
who are you gonna listen to  rowley 
me or joshie 
joshie says to respect your parents
and follow your dreams 
then joshie must get beaten up a lot 
you actually almost look as good as me 
am i great at this or what 
there s bryce anderson  just be cool 
  hey  bryce 
  yeah  hey  bryce 
cute butt 
you re killing me  you know that 
look  rowley  tonight s halloween 
our favorite night of the year 
so  just promise me you won t wear 
do or say anything weird 
you re kidding me  right 
my mom wanted me to be visible at night 
from space 
so  we ll hit a few houses
on the way to the north side 
which is where we ll do
most of our trick or treating 
why are we going all the way over there 
it s where the rich people live 
they hand out  like  two  three pieces
of big candy to each kid 
not that candy corn crap 
i m talking about full size
milky ways and nutter butters 
plus  if we time it right 
rich people get tired of answering
their doors and just leave the bowl out 
we can clean up 
you re lucky 
my mom doesn t let me play
with makeup any more 
shut up  tool 
léded diper s got a gig tonight 
going to the north side  huh 
takes you right past
the devil worshiper woods 
the devil worshiper woods 
you know about that story  right 
well  there used to be this house
right here where these woods are 
they had to tear it down because
what happened there was so terrible 
what happened there 
well  a long time ago 
two kids who were  i don t know 
maybe in middle school 
they trick or treated at that house
on halloween night 
but the house was full of devil worshipers
who put the kids
in these giant pizza ovens 
and they cooked them and they ate them 
but they forgot to turn off the ovens 
so the house burned down
with everyone in it 
how d the trees get there 
and then they planted trees 
and to this day  on halloween night 
you can still hear the demonic laughter
of the devil worshiper ghosts
as they roam the woods 
looking for more kids to sacrifice 
hey  rodrick 
i need you to help me out  like   
are you wearing eyeliner 
  trick or treat 
  susan 
  i m on door duty 
  thank you

history of plumbing excursion

  yeah 
  are they talking about me 
i don t know  i don t speak russian 
and finally  some positions
have opened up for the safety patrol 
if anyone is interested 
see mr  winsky after homeroom 
now that s what i m talking about 
safety patrol  the cops of middle school 
you boss people around  report the jerks 
and miss class three times a week 
safety patrol is a sacred trust 
when you put on this vest and that badge
you become a protector of the weak 
you become an enforcer of the laws
of this school 
because today s litterer and jaywalker
is tomorrow s window breaker
and graffiti vandal 
and it s ourjob to stop it 
so i ask you  are you up for the job 
 yes   yes 
then welcome to safety patrol 
just remember  with great power   
  whoa 
     comes great responsibility 
now  you get your first assignment
just after lunch 
so you ll be excused
from the first 20 minutes of sixth period 
but that means we ll miss algebra   
do we get free stuff 
  free hot cocoa 
  could this day get any better 
whoa  is that cocoa 
  sorry  safety patrol only 
  sorry 
you rejected the school paper 
but you joined the safety patrol 
look  are you working
your way down the evolutionary ladder 
what 
look  safety patrol
is the lowest of the low 
the geekiest of the geeky 
the island of misfit toys 
you re just jealous they don t trust you
to keep our school safe 
now if you ll excuse me 
i need to secure the perimeter 
  i m hungry 
  keep it straight  people 
single file line  one by one 
greg  it s those guys from halloween 
what do we do 
come on  man  just pull my finger 
i swear to god  i m not gonna do anything 
everybody  shoulder to shoulder 
shoulder to shoulder 
  go  go 
  whoa  whoa 
  that was close 
  too close 
it s times like these that make me realize 
rowley s pretty lucky
to have me as a friend 
and i got twisted wizard two 
and a new bike 
and we re going to take a family trip
to new york city for new year s eve 
  what did you get 
  my dad got me a weight lifting set 
do you know how many video games
i could ve gotten instead 
i had to get out of there
before he expected me to  like  use it 
anyway  let s play some
twisted wizard two at your house 
probably not a good idea 
my dad s still annoyed at you 
for what 
remember that secret language
we made up last week 
your pa dad pa smells pa
like pa a woman pa 
i think he cracked our code 
we should probably do something outside 
why can t you ride
and i throw at you first 
my legs kind of hurt
from walking over here 
okay  rowley  come on  get up 
shake it off 
are you sure the doctor was right 
it really didn t look that broken to me 
yeah  it s broken  the x ray never lies

hey  i m the one who broke his hand 
then you re a jerk 
  sorry

rowley  you re so funny 
  after i stood   
  i couldn t believe it 
rowley was eating at an actual table
because of something i did 
where s my credit 
and he s right handed 
he can feed himself just fine 
so  how s that class favorite thing
working out for you

i realized rowley s injury thing
was a pretty good racket 
  it s gonna be so much fun 
  hey  guys  check it out

splinter that was left untreated 
want to be the first to sign
my sympathy sheet

and on the x ray  you could see
where the bone just snapped right in half
i had the exact same break last year 
and it got all purple 
  cool  mine  too 
  hey  gregory  want to sign the card 
you got rowley a card 
what  no  it s for bryan little 
you know  the guy who writes
the wacky dawg cartoons
for the school paper 
he has mono and he s going to be out
for three months 
that really stinks 
so  just out of curiosity 
who s gonna do the cartoon 
they re having tryouts  but
the important thing is bryan gets better 
absolutely 
bryan little getting mono was destiny 
i draw cartoons all the time 
i m gonna win this 
i decided to go ahead and forgive rowley
for milking the broken hand so hard
and i told him
he could work on the cartoon with me 
so  i was thinking
we could do something like this 
oops  i stepped in a puddle 
at least it s not an acid puddle 
it is an acid puddle 
zoo wee mama 
zoo wee mama 
it s the same joke every time 
yeah  zoo wee mama 
we can t just do the same thing
over and over 
we can if it s zoo wee mama 
it has to be a little more sophisticated 
i wonder what is in this cute little box 
it s not a box 
it s a brick  you dumb moron 
oops  i ve been trying to open it all day 
  can he say   zoo wee mama  
  no  it s not funny 
well  i think it is  i like zoo wee mama 
you know what  if you like it so much 
then why don t you go do it yourself 
okay  i will 
see you

  whoa

and though doctors assure us
that mrs  cheznik is no longer contagious 
the cafeteria nachos bar will be closed
for the remainder of the week 
and now  what you ve all been waiting for 
the faculty  student council
and editors have all met
and selected the new cartoonist
for the school paper 
and the winner is
 zoo wee mama  by rowley jefferson

  rowley  will you put me in your cartoon 
  sure 
and me  too  i want to be the one
who says   zoo wee mama  
  you got it 
  hey  rowley  congratulations 
  thanks 
  no problem 
you know  i read all the submissions
and yours was by far the best 
i read yours  too 
  hey  rowley 
  hey  bryce 
  yeah  hey  bryce 
  hey  fella 
wow  everyone knows me now 
  it s like i m famous  isn t this great 
  yeah 
rowley jefferson 
i need to see you in my office  now 
i just took a call from a mrs  irvine
about what happened
to the kindergarteners last week 
she was very upset  and so am i 
  what 
  you violated the sacred trust 
this   
this badge is supposed to mean
something  and you just spat on it 
i can barely even look at you 
  i really don t   
  just save it 
you are officially suspended
from safety patrol 
and i expect a full apology
to the kindergarteners 
yes  sir 
  hey  what did he have to say 
  i m kicked off 
i don t even know what he s talking about 
rowley 
  what 
  nothing 
you ve been home for an hour
and haven t badgered me for any snacks 
are you feeling okay 
well  i m kind of in a tough situation 
i know something
and if i tell the truth about it 
it could hurt somebody 
but if i don t  it could
hurt somebody else 
well  you have to trust your gut
and try to do the right thing 
because it s our choices
that make us who we are 
okay 
i was up all night  tossing and turning 
thinking about my mom s advice 
and i finally decided
to do the right thing 
i m sorry i terrorized you  children 
what 
i decided to let rowley
take one for the team 
but i m not entirely sure
that was the right call 
hey  how s it going 
well  i was pretty upset
about being suspended from safety patrol 
but then i just started drawing a bunch
of zoo wee mamas and i felt better 
look  i put you in this week s cartoon 
and you even get to say 
 zoo wee mama  
wow  that s really
nice 
so  listen 
it s kind of funny  you know 
the whole safety patrol thing 
yeah 
ready for the funny part 
well  i m the one
who terrorized those kids 
  what 
  yeah 
and i think we can both learn
some valuable lessons from this 
like  i should be more careful what i do
in front of mrs  lr  ine s house 
and you  well 
you should be more careful
who you lend your coat to 
you know what  greg 
you re not a good friend 
whoa  how could you even say that 
i m a great friend 
if you were a great friend 
you would have told mr  winsky the truth 
okay  one thing 
you can t get mad aboutjust   
you only care about yourself 
you hated my cartoon 
you made fun of my clothes 
you disrespected joshie 
you broke my hand
and you didn t even seem sorry 
that broken hand was the best thing
that ever happened to you 
don t call me 
don t come by my house  we re done 
i thought the whole thing would blow over 
but rowley was still giving me
the silent treatment 
  even when i tried to make the first move 
  yeah 
so  anyway  i was so angry at him   
one of the kindergarteners
finally told their parents the whole story 
greg  you re relieved of your safety patrol
duties  effective immediately 
rowley 
for showing dignity under false suspicion 
i am promoting you
to team captain 
now  that s a position that i held
for two years  i know you ll honor it 
hey  rowley  my mom says it s okay
for me to sleep over tonight 
awesome 
the whole thing with rowley is 
i was willing to let bygones be bygones 
but then he made friends with collin
just to mess with me 
as if i even care if he   
well  you know what 
two can play at that game 
there s no going back  sergeant 
i need to board the helicopter 
do you have my back 
i will always have your back  captain 
  hey 
  hey  greg heffley

want to have a sleepover
