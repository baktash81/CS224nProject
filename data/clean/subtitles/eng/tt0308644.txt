really
mary hello
yes james
im headed off for the park if youd
like to join me its a beautiful morning
youll be working wont you
perhaps yes
ill let you to your work then
morning mr barrie
morning emma
have a good day sir
and you
thats it go on boy go get it boy
thats right good boy grab it good
who do you belong to
come on boy come on
excuse me sir
youre standing on my sleeve
am i so sorry
i might point out
youre lying under my bench
i have to im afraid
ive been put in a dungeon
by the evil prince george
im sorry if it bothers you
well if youre trapped in the dungeon
there isnt much to be done now is there
perhaps i could slide a key to you
through the bars
i wouldnt risk it sir the evil
prince george has tortured many men
im sorry is he bothering you sir
my brother can be
an extremely irritating sort of person
aha prince george i gather
i understand you are the horrible tyrant
who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch
im not horrible really but
a firm ruler yes kind and tolerant
and what precisely is
what did you say your name was
michael
what precisely is michaels crime
hes my younger brother
ah
fair enough sorry lad cannot free you
thats all right
do you mind us playing with your dog
no go on
this is jack second in line to the throne
and that ones michael hes only five
and im in prison for it
im so sorry are my boys bothering you
were not bothering him mum
michael darling
come out from under there
i cant im in prison
oh i see
jm barrie pleased to meet you
jm barrie the author a pleasure
sylvia llewelyn davies
are you a writer
i am
hes a playwright jack
quite a famous one at that
i apologize i imagine youre writing
no not at all
wheres peter
what have you written mr barrie
well currently i make my living
entertaining princes and their courts
with my trained bear porthos
if you command your brother
peter to join us
i am willing prince george
to give you just such a performance
in exchange for the freedom
of this prisoner of course
very well
very well
now
i want you to pay particular attention
to the teeth
some unscrupulous trainers will show you
a bear whose teeth have all been pulled
while other cowards
will force the brute into a muzzle
only the true master would attempt these
tricks without either measure of safety
what did you bring me over here for
peter
this is absurd its just a dog
come on darling
just a dog just
porthos dont listen to him
porthos dreams of being a bear
and you want to dash those dreams
by saying hes just a dog
what a horrible candlesnuffing word
thats like saying he cant climb
that mountain hes just a man
or thats not a diamond its just a rock
just
fine then turn him into a bear if you can
peter where are your manners
with those eyes my bonny lad
im afraid youd never see it
however with just a wee bit of imagination
i can turn around right now and see
the great bear porthos
dance with me
thank you i dont think ive ever seen
a performance quite like it
were here every day and the bear
is always more than happy to perform
well perhaps well see you here
tomorrow then
perhaps
peter jump up please darling quick
bye
bye
peter didnt you enjoy that
ive seen better
well michael wanted the bear
kept prisoner with him
and peter insisted
that michael was hardly a prisoner
and porthos simply wasnt a bear at all
i do very much hope to see them tomorrow
whats her name
sylvia um
mrs something davies
llewelyn davies
you know her
i know who she is of course
why shes a du maurier
for heavens sake
her father was the artist
her brothers the actor
and there was something tragic
that happened with her husband
oh yes he died
cancer of the jaw i believe
thats horrible
yes apparently he left her with four boys
and no income to speak of
if it wasnt for her mothers help
james
we should have them to dinner
should we
absolutely ive always wanted
to meet madam du maurier
why she knows practically
everyone there is worth knowing
what are you writing about
oh
nothing of any great consequence
i cant write
have you ever kept a journal
ever tried your hand at writing a play
well then how do you know
i know thats all
i see wheres your mother today
and the rest of the boys
home mothers got a bit of a chest cold
im sure everyone would be happy
to see you though one afternoon
i should leave you to your writing
peter
ill see you later then
why didnt you tell me charles
you knew it wasnt any good
why didnt you tell me james
you knew it wasnt any good hm
i took an extended lease on the theater
keeping the actors on
i dont have another play
im sure you will
wont you
well see
i need you to sign for the storage
mr frohman
lower
easy does it take your time
it was never meant to be taken seriously
you know what happened james
they changed it
they changed what
the critics
they made it important
hm
whats it called
whats it called
play
play
bang bang bang
bang
return the boy to us you nasty lnjun
our people teach boy lndian ways
make him great warrior
our chief running nose never let him go
bang bang bang
me wounded peter times short
you go spread wings
and soar like eagle above enemy
fly back to our chief
tell her of my brave defeat
thats crazy indians cant fly
of course they can go on go on go on
listen to us boy
this lnjun kidnapped you
not true we kidnap no one you lost boy
i teach you ways of the brave
i take you as my own son
you are not my father
bang bang bang bang
ive got him
let me go
stop it you two
ooh we are awful arent we
im warning you
oh im scared
of course you had a bit of fun
for a change
stop it you two get off
dont
jack
stop it
get off george
peter
im terribly sorry
no it wasnt your fault
im afraid it might have been
to be honest im just happy you got him
to join in the game
oh yes i was a tremendous success
mr barrie its more
than ive been able to achieve
peters a different boy
since his father died
you know i dont think
hes even had a good cry about it
well grief affects us all
in different ways doesnt it
yes it does
oh by the way my wife would like
to invite you and the boys over to dinner
your mother as well
oh
how kind that would be lovely
well
dont you all look
lovely in your little suits
and mrs du maurier what a shame it is
that weve not met until this evening
how kind of you to say so
not at all i cant tell you how many times
ive been to a charity or a social event
and seen your name listed
among the organizers
its the very thing i would love to do myself
if i could just find the time
my problem is in finding the time
to do everything else
at the moment i am running
two households
sylvia believes she can get by
without a housekeeper
mother
my house is quite large enough for us all
but the idea of living with me seems
not now please mother
we help her keep the house in order
dont interrupt george
where did you get your manners
sorry grandmother
mr barrie i understand youve become
playmates of my grandchildren
oh they indulge me really
on the contrary
the other day we took to an exploration
of darkest africa in our garden
but mr barrie was taken ill
by the bite of a what was it
tsetse fly quite horrible
yes and he swelled to the size
of a hippopotamus
fingers like sausages
and we had to float in him down the river
like he was a great bloated raft
but the fishing was good wasnt it
james
please
bye
thank you so much
lovely evening
thank you bye
good night
good night
well that was a disaster
painful
utterly painful to see
i dont know what you mean
i had a lovely time
oh james please
my problem is in finding
the time to do everything else
i never felt so judged in my life
judged how do you mean
a grown man for heavens sake
playing all day long with children
in any case i hardly think theyll be
the social contact wed hoped for
i hadnt really thought of them that way
i just enjoy their company
hes been a good friend to us mother
yes but what does that mean hm
surely you dont intend
to keep spending your afternoons
with those children do you
and so today ladies and gentlemen
using only the wind
and his own physical strength
george llewelyn davies shall test
the very limits of the atmosphere
using his tethered craft go on boy
go on george
youre going to break it george
george stop
i just need a bit more speed
i want to do it
hold off a bit george
i think its in need of a tail
oh wait
here james this will do
thats a good idea
no its not heavy enough
i want to do it
you coming peter
porthos
itll work this time
porthos give us your bell thats good
michael
yeah
now would you like to give it a go
yes please
oh he cant run fast enough
of course he can
let him try jack
now george you hold the kite
george
come on boys lets go back up to the top
come on peter
right george hold it up darling
youve got to run now ready ready
run run michael
run
oh i told you this wasnt going to work
i dont think hes fast enough
its not going to work
if no one believes in him
now give him a chance
michael go back to your starting position
come on darling try again
george you take the kite
now this time i dont want a fleas breath
of doubt we must get that kite in the air
right look i think i feel a bit
more breeze are you ready michael
you can do it michael
youve got to run run michael run
run
thats it
yes he did it
keep running keep running
what are you writing about now
oh just making notes
im never really certain what theyre about
until ive read them over later
something about the kite
now why do you ask that
i dont know
if i were a writer i think i could tell
a whole story about flying the kite today
perhaps you should then thats
a fantastic idea why not give it a try
i hope you havent been talking about
anything too serious with this one
no talking a bit of silliness really
can we have him for supper
have him to stay for supper michael
were not cannibals
you are welcome you know
sylvia mr barrie
where have you been
flying a kite mother
and having a wonderful time
im sorry i didnt know
you were coming this evening
no well apparently you forgot then
i brought some supper along for us all
you didnt need to do that
well theres no food in the house is there
really you dont need to wait
till the cupboard is bare
please mother come on darlings
wipe feet theres been
enough tracking round here
george i thought you said you were going
to help your mother take care of the house
coat michael please yes
and coat hanger good
will we see you tomorrow
no youre going to be helping
round the house tomorrow
mother there is absolutely no need for this
you cant do everything yourself
look at you youre horribly flush
youre wearing yourself out
thank you for a lovely day james
excuse me mother
so from tomorrow were going to have
some discipline around here
and not one of you will escape
good evening mr barrie
good evening sarah
good evening mr barrie
good evening emma
you missed supper
perhaps ill have something later
i have a bit of writing i wanted to do
are you sure it was a lovely meal duck
sarah let emma cook this evening
is that right listen what would you think
of loaning emma out to the davies
for the occasional evening
they dont actually have a cook
i take it mrs davies enjoyed the meal
that she had here
i imagine she could use an extra hand
now and again thats all
thats very charitable of you
perhaps we can send over
some of the silver as well
and what about linen
i wouldnt be surprised if some of hers
was looking a bit shabby
please mary stop
maybe she can send over
some of the things weve run short on
my husband for example
we rarely see him in this house
that hasnt seemed to bother you
for some time now
lords and ladies his royal highness
king michael the benevolent
protector of the realm
that scepters made of wood
yes well we dream on a budget here
dont we
no i mean everyone thinks its made
of gold but its just an old hunk of wood
the means to an end peter
what weve done is taken
an old hunk of wood
and transformed it for all the world to see
into the most magnificent gold
there you go
whats this
all great writers begin with a good
leather binding and a respectable title
open it
the boy castaways
being a record of the terrible adventures
of the brothers davies
faithfully set forth by
peter llewelyn davies
kipling would swallow his own ear
for a title like that
stab him george you can do it
i still have no idea what to write
write about anything
write about your family
write about the talking whale
what whale
the one thats trapped in your imagination
and desperate to get out come sit down
i have actually begun writing about the
adventures of the davies brothers myself
a play
a play indeed yes
and i would be extremely honored
if you would allow me the use of your name
for one of the characters
i dont know what to say
say yes
good man
porthos thats mine let go
i wont go to bed i wont i wont
you should have been in bed
half an hour ago young man
im afraid ive grown hopelessly lax
in my discipline
nonsense young boys
should never be sent to bed
they always wake up a day older
and then before you know it
theyre grown
their father would have been horrified
of course he never would have allowed
a dog in the house either
hed have tied him up in the yard
right last one in beds a hairy toad
you mean a lot to my boys you know
especially peter
it seems to me
that peters trying to grow up too fast
i imagine he thinks that grownups dont
hurt as deeply as children do when they
when they lose someone
i lost my elder brother david
when i was just peters age
and it nearly destroyed my mother
james im so sorry
your poor mother
i cant imagine losing a child
aye
she didnt get out of bed for months
she wouldnt eat
i tried everything to make her happy but
she only wanted david
so
one day
i dressed myself in davids clothing
and i went to her
you must have frightened her to death
i think it was the first time
she ever actually looked at me
and that was the end of the boy james
i used to say to myself
hed gone to neverland
where
neverland its a wonderful place
ive not spoken about this before
to anyone
ever
whats it like neverland
one day ill take you there
wait a minute james
hes a fairy
er no hes the irrepressible
spirit of youth tinker bell is the fairy
tinker bell is a woman
shes not a woman shes a fairy
he is a boy who stays young forever
james how does anyone
stay young forever it doesnt work
he just believes charles
he imagines life the way he wants it to be
and he believes in it long enough and hard
enough that it all appears before him see
james im your friend
youre coming off a flop
you have a man who is a fairy
no a boy who has a fairy
and this girl calls herself tinker
and you have a pirate ship on stage
surrounded by tons and tons of water
thats a lot of water
its a lot of water
yes and thats a lot of money
it is but we can fake the water
oh well if we can fake the water
then im sure your play will be a hit
you know what i think ill do i think
ill imagine life the way i want it to be
long enough and hard enough
yes and then the money for the play
will appear magically before me
thats right thats it
yes
how does the clock wind up
inside the crocodile
he swallows it
ah of course he does
out
how was he
well done
good show
i finally get the courage
to invite the boys to a game
and we have to suffer
this grave humiliation
its perfect actually
spend a good deal of time with them
dont you
every moment i can spare in fact
im glad for you
and mrs davies seems to be
having a good time of it as well
you should be aware though james
what some people have been saying
mind you i wouldnt bring it up
if i thought the rumors would pass
im not surprised what are they saying
very well
that you spend much more time with mrs
davies than you do with your own wife
shes a widow and
and a friend thats it nothing more
there have also been questions about
how you spend your time with those boys
and why
thats outrageous how could anyone
think something so evil
theyre children
theyre innocent children
you find a glimmer of happiness
in this world
theres always someone
who wants to destroy it
no thank you arthur but i dont think
many will give credence to such nonsense
then why is no one sitting with them
once you get a bit of notoriety james
people watch you and they will
look for ways to drag you down
are you sure your wife doesnt
object to us taking over your cottage
for the summer james
she doesnt go there anymore
really
its such a relief to get away
youll come and visit i hope
of course are we in
everyone in
can i drive uncle jim
er no
out of the way
or ill make haggis out of you
get the sheep out the way
are we there yet
almost almost there
i can see the cottage
shall we explore michael
dont tear your clothes please
come on follow me
be careful of stinging nettles
hurry up everyone
would you like to see the rest of it
mm yes
ello
thought you could escape
from captain swarthy eh
off to the ship with you then
off to the ship son
so now you can either choose
to become a pirate with the rest of us
or well toss you to the sharks
how marvelous
well maybe the crocodiles eh
no ones escaped captain
excellent work matey
now then
now is your only chance to speak
who amongst you is ready
to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea
i am
not finished yet
to enter upon
the most dangerous chapter
in your young
and soontobewasted lives
what did you say what are doing son
are you giggling on my ship
giggling what did you say
i said im ready captain
whats your name boy
im curly the oldest and wisest of the crew
cut him loose matey
welcome aboard curly
your job will be to mop the deck
and who be you young squire

by men and greatly desired by the ladies
jack
welcome aboard nibs
you shall polish all wood surfaces
grab a hold of that rigging
and you lad
im peter
thats not a pirate name
what about dastardly jim eh
no just peter
i like my name
very well
in punishment for lack of an interesting
pirate name peter shall walk the plank
cut him loose
what are you playing again
the boy
what have you got excuse me
mr barrie sir
theres been a mistake here sir
it says here im to play the nanny
i dont imagine i quite fit that part eh
youre not actually the nanny
youre a dog
what
a newfound land
well put you in a great big fluffy dog suit
rrr
oh right
actually we dont have a tinker bell cast
do we he could play tinker bell
heavens no tinker bells a light
it moves around the stage
just a wee light
that moves around the stage
bit worried about this
lets see
weve got john darling michael darling
tiger lily smee skylights
its a play for puppets
tootles nibs curly
all these names are absurd
when you see them all together
captain hook s
oh hello james
youre out of your mind
how were rehearsals
fine great theyre going quite well
good
yes thank you
hello
hello
how was your journey
it was quite long im exhausted
lets get you some tea
thatd be nice thanks
can you come to the playhouse
in a moment michael hes just arrived
but i said id get him they always
send peter to do things i said ill do it
it will spoil the surprise
what surprise darling
its a great surprise weve taken
most of the day preparing for it
everybodys waiting for you
then we mustnt keep them waiting
please dont tell them that i told you
the surprise i said i wouldnt
oh well you didnt really tell us
anything about it did you
yes i did its a play
its a play
the lamentable tale of lady ursula
a play in one act
by peter llewelyn davies
this is just a bit of silliness really
i should hope so go on
i just wanted to take a stab at writing
you know
well the others do
a good job with it anyway
well lets see it then
the lamentable tale of lady ursula
one morning just after sunrise
lady ursula the most beautiful daughter
of lord and lady dubon
made her way up the steps of the great
cathedral to pray to her blessed saint
suddenly as she reached
the cathedral doors
the gargoyle that guarded
the sacred structure
came to life and swooped down upon her
the people of the village all ran to safety
but lady ursula slipped
on the cathedral steps
and the gargoyle descended upon her
wrapping her in its huge wings
and taking her high up into the spires
of the cathedral
go on peter
not long after this sorrowful event
a young knight named jm barnaby
came into the city
sylvia
do you want some water
mother
no james
lets get her back to the house go on
she wont discuss it with me at all
she claims it was nothing
i tell you doctor she couldnt breathe
you cant very well treat a patient
who wont admit theres anything wrong
well youll have to make her understand
that something is
ill try and do my best
great just there
get your hand flat like that
ow
then like that
come in
the good doctor didnt feel
up to the challenge on this one
he thinks you need to go to hospital
for further tests
nonsense
when would i have time for that
besides this familys
had enough of hospitals
perhaps they can help you
i know what they can do for me
i saw what they did for my husband
no james ive no interest in hospitals
im keenly interested
in having some supper
what did you and mother decide
to tell us this time its only a chest cold
we hadnt decided anything
stop lying to me
im sick of grownups lying to me
im not lying to you
i dont know whats wrong
father might take us fishing
thats what she said ln just a few weeks
and he died the next morning
that wasnt a lie peter
that was your mothers hope
he barely moved for a week
but i started planning our fishing trip
i will never lie to you i promise you that
no all youll do is teach me
to make up stupid stories
and pretend that things
arent happening until
i wont im not blind
i wont be made a fool
whats this peter
the play
darling i wanted to see the rest of it
magics gone out of it a bit now
hasnt it
all because of a silly chest cold
james
well you remember gilbert cannan
dont you
good evening
mr cannan has been working on the
committee to fight government censorship
i know how involved youve been as well
he wanted to speak to you
i did think youd be home so much sooner
its been a long evening mary
yes
well if id realized how late it was
of course
i should perhaps talk to you
at another time not so late
that will be fine
well talk then
thank you for your patience mrs barrie
mr barrie
good night
night
well arent you going to speak
what would you like me to say
curious how late mr cannan stayed
i suppose
and then lets see what comes next
no later than you were out james
and how is mrs davies this evening
oh yes i would have a great answer
for that one wouldnt i
how dare you
this isnt one of your plays
i know that mary its quite serious
but im not ready for this conversation
wherever it may lead
perhaps we can talk in the morning yes
good night then
mr barrie dont you agree
this is a little bit tight
no no in fact i think its quite baggy
baggy
quite frumpy id bring it
right in just there
thats very tight
and put maybe a plank of wood there
to straighten him up
oh aye yes mr barrie
plank of wood
some wood there on the shoulders as well
otherwise its marvelous
right sir
youll be sick tomorrow
ill be sick tonight
james
were just having some tea
you remember my mother of course
yes of course how do you do
may i take your hat
thats enough boys
boys please dont run in the house
youll break something
come away from that door
come on come on
id like a word with you
mr barrie before you go
well only be a few minutes
boys why dont you go
and play in the garden go on
is he in trouble
sh
because ive been alone with grandmother
and i know what its like
should we retire into the study
why dont you join them dear
very well
i do apologize for interrupting
would you close the door please
certainly
sylvia has told me you have offered her
the services of your household staff
well not exactly
that wont be necessary
ill leave that to sylvia of course
youll leave that to me mr barrie
you see im moving in here from now on
youre moving in
im going where im most needed
and i can certainly see to it
that this house is managed
without resorting to your charity
it isnt charity mrs du maurier
i was only trying to help as a friend
have you no idea how much your
friendship has already cost my daughter
or are you really that selfish
i beg your pardon
dont you see what a visit
to the summer cottage of a married man
does for a widows future prospects
sylvia needs to find someone
the boys need a father
and you are destroying any hope this
family has of pulling itself together again
i have only wanted good things
for this family mrs du maurier
ill look after them
you have your own family
to concern yourself with
what are you suggesting
im suggesting that you protect
what you have mr barrie
that is precisely what i am doing
i was so certain what i would find in this
some little confession
would leak out onto the page
i dont write love notes in my journal
no
still you knew who i meant didnt you
thats some comfort actually
it means i know you just a little after all
you neednt steal my journal
to get to know me mary
no i suppose i could just go see the plays
i was hopelessly naive when i married you
i imagined that brilliant people
disappeared to some secret place
where good ideas floated around
like leaves in autumn
and i hoped at least once
you would take me there with you
there is no such place
yes there is
neverland
its the best youve written james

but she was trembling so badly
she couldnt even finish her tea
im not a fool uncle james
i deserve to know the truth
i dont know the truth
she wont talk about it
but you think its serious
it could be the doctor felt
she should go and have some tests
then youll have to convince her
to go then
ive tried she wont listen to me
and lately to be quite honest
it seems that all my best intentions for
your family have come to nothing but harm
apparently ive made
quite a mess of things
its grandmother isnt it
shes run you off hasnt she
oh shes absolutely tried with great
effort and perhaps with good reason
it isnt you uncle jim she just
she just doesnt want
to see mother hurt anymore
look at that
how magnificent

encourage what
oh james please
you know perfectly well what
george wont allow them to set his arm
unless i submit to an examination
i see well i suppose youll have to then
because hes quite a stubborn young man
when he sets his mind to it
this is absurd
they wont tell me anything different
different
so youve already spoken to a doctor then
that is not your concern
my understanding is that my condition
may be quite serious
however my wish is that
life should go on as normal
so
ill have the examination
and ill take whatever medications
they advise
but i dont want to know what theyre for
and i dont want you inquiring into it
any further
wouldnt dream of it

thank you peter
this is peter pan how wonderful
really
youre peter pan why you must be
quite the little adventurer
look its true
he has no shadow
but im not peter pan
he is
and theres been no improvement
since my last visit
no
has james been by at all today mother
dr brighton may i have a word
excuse me a moment
you havent been keeping him from me
have you
as a matter of fact
i actually hoped he might come
would have proved me wrong about him
of course with the success of his play
the whole of london
must be knocking at his door
im sorry dear
what is it
its a secret
quiet michael
i didnt say anything
mother could you come downstairs
for a moment
oh she cant come downstairs
what are you thinking of george
actually i think a trip downstairs
might do her good maam
what have you been up to
just wait and see
its a play
its not just a play michael
its the play
of course well have to make do
with a few compromises
much of it will have to be imagined
as it should be
as it should be thats right
michael come and sit here
next to mum
when youre ready
i wont go to bed i wont i wont
nana it isnt six oclock yet
two minutes more please
you know fairies peter
yes
but theyre nearly all dead now
you see wendy when the first baby
laughed for the first time
the laugh broke into a thousand pieces
and they all went skipping about
and that was the beginning of fairies
and now when every new baby is born
its first laugh becomes a fairy
so there ought to be one fairy
for every boy and girl
ought to be lsnt there
oh no
children know such a lot now
soon they dont believe in fairies
and every time a child says
l dont believe in fairies
theres a fairy somewhere
that falls down dead
who is that
the redskins were defeated
wendy and the boys
captured by the pirates
ill rescue her ill rescue her
oh thats just my medicine
poisoned who could have poisoned it
why tink youve drunk my medicine
it was poisoned
and you drank it to save my life
tink
are you dying
her light is growing faint
if it goes out that means shes dead
her voice is so low i can scarcely hear
what shes saying
she says she thinks
she could get well again
if children believed in fairies
do you believe in fairies
say quick that you believe
if you believe clap your hands
clap louder
thank you thank you
that is neverland
so many perfect days
i really began to believe
wed go on like that forever
oh stop it
she wasnt going to stay with you forever
she had a husband my father
she never cared for you
the way she did for him
im not trying to replace your father peter
i could never do that
youd best let him go
george would you take the boys back
to the house ill be with you in a moment
go on dear
im terribly sorry
ive ruined everything ive touched
in this family
stop giving yourself so much credit
peters grieving
it has nothing to do with you
perhaps if i just had
a bit more time with him
no mr barrie that wont be good enough
if a bit more time is all you can provide
youd better leave him alone
i know you dont much care for me
mrs du maurier and i respect that
but i loved your daughter very much
and i love those boys
and i think they need me right now
is that so
and for how long after
meaning what
sylvia has requested a coguardianship
for the boys in her will
you mr barrie and myself
and what do you have to say about that
i shall respect my daughters wishes
something i should have done more of
while she was alive
but if you feel youre not ready
for such a commitment
i assure you i can certainly
look after the boys by myself
do you think i could abandon those boys
sit down peter
mother pasted it back together
after i ruined it
and then i saw the play
i just started writing
and i havent been able to stop
she would be very pleased to know that
listen ive just spoken
with your grandmother
and im staying
for good
im sorry i was so horrible
dont worry
its just
i thought shed always be here
so did i
but in fact
she is
because shes on every page
of your imagination
youll always have her there always
but why did she have to die
i dont know boy
when i think of your mother
i will always remember
how happy she looked
sitting there in the parlor
watching a play about her family
about her boys that never grew up
she went to neverland
and you can visit her any time you like
