  can you 
  no  i can t  how are you 
  arthur 
  james 
you were sorely missed
at the last club meeting 
was i 
we were beginning to wonder
which is your hobby  writing or cricket 
you wanted to speak with mr barrie 
didn t you 
oh yes  but we shouldn t interrupt them 
should we 
i don t see why not 
if you ask me  the problem
lies in our batting order 
  james 
  hello  darling 
you remember mr and mrs snow 
don t you 
  mrs snow 
  mr barrie 
mr snow 
the snows have been waiting
to meet with you all evening 
  oh  yes 
  is that right 
your play this evening 
it was remarkable  wasn t it 
was it 
well  thank you  that s very kind of you 
i m glad you liked it 
how did you feel it went 
  i think i can do better 
  really 
  mary  hello 
  yes  james 
i m headed off for the park if you d
like to join me  it s a beautiful morning 
you ll be working  won t you 
perhaps  yes 
i ll let you to your work then 
  morning  mr barrie 
  morning  emma 
  have a good day  sir 
  and you 
that s it  go on  boy  go get it  boy 
that s right  good boy  grab it  good 
who do you belong to 
come on  boy  come on 
excuse me  sir 
you re standing on my sleeve 
am i  so sorry 
i might point out
you re lying under my bench 
i have to  i m afraid 
i ve been put in a dungeon
by the evil prince george 
i m sorry if it bothers you 
well  if you re trapped in the dungeon 
there isn t much to be done now  is there 
perhaps i could slide a key to you
through the bars 
i wouldn t risk it  sir  the evil
prince george has tortured many men 
i m sorry  is he bothering you  sir 
my brother can be
an extremely irritating sort of person 
aha  prince george  i gather 
i understand you are the horrible tyrant
who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch 
i m not horrible really  but
a firm ruler  yes  kind and tolerant 
and what precisely is   
what did you say your name was 
  michael 
  what precisely is michael s crime 
  he s my younger brother 
  ah 
  fair enough  sorry  lad  cannot free you 
  that s all right 
  do you mind us playing with your dog 
  no  go on 
this is jack  second in line to the throne
and that one s michael  he s only five 
and i m in prison for it 
  i m so sorry  are my boys bothering you 
  we re not bothering him  mum 
michael  darling 
come out from under there 
i can t  i m in prison 
oh  i see 
jm barrie  pleased to meet you 
jm barrie  the author  a pleasure 
sylvia llewelyn davies 
  are you a writer 
  i am 
he s a playwright  jack 
quite a famous one  at that 
  i apologize  i imagine you re writing 
  no  not at all 
  where s peter 
  what have you written  mr barrie 
well  currently  i make my living
entertaining princes and their courts
with my trained bear  porthos 
if you command your brother 
peter  to join us 
i am willing  prince george 
to give you just such a performance
in exchange for the freedom
of this prisoner  of course 
  very well 
  very well 
now   
i want you to pay particular attention
to the teeth 
some unscrupulous trainers will show you
a bear whose teeth have all been pulled 
while other cowards
will force the brute into a muzzle 
only the true master would attempt these
tricks without either measure of safety 
  what did you bring me over here for 
  peter 
this is absurd  it s just a dog 
come on  darling 
 just a dog    just  
porthos  don t listen to him 
porthos dreams of being a bear
and you want to dash those dreams
by saying he s  just a dog  
what a horrible  candle snuffing word 
that s like saying   he can t climb
that mountain  he s just a man  
or   that s not a diamond  it s just a rock  
 just  
fine then  turn him into a bear  if you can 
peter  where are your manners 
with those eyes  my bonny lad 
i m afraid you d never see it 
however  with just a wee bit of imagination 
i can turn around right now and see   
the great bear  porthos 
dance with me 
thank you  i don t think i ve ever seen
a performance quite like it 
we re here every day  and the bear
is always more than happy to perform 
well  perhaps we ll see you here
tomorrow then 
perhaps 
  peter  jump up please  darling  quick 
  bye 
bye 
  peter  didn t you enjoy that 
  i ve seen better 
well  michael wanted the bear
kept prisoner with him 
and peter insisted
that michael was hardly a prisoner
and porthos simply wasn t a bear at all 
i do very much hope to see them tomorrow 
  what s her name 
  sylvia  um   
mrs    something davies 
llewelyn davies 
  you know her 
  i know who she is  of course 
why  she s a du maurier 
for heaven s sake 
her father was the artist 
her brother s the actor 
and there was something    tragic
that happened with her husband 
oh  yes  he died 
cancer of the jaw  i believe 
that s horrible 
yes  apparently  he left her with four boys
and no income to speak of 
if it wasn t for her mother s help   
james 
  we should have them to dinner 
  should we 
absolutely  i ve always wanted
to meet madam du maurier 
why  she knows practically
everyone there is worth knowing 
  what are you writing about 
  oh 
nothing of any great consequence 
i can t write 
have you ever kept a journal 
ever tried your hand at writing a play 
well  then how do you know 
i know  that s all 
i see  where s your mother today
and the rest of the boys 
home  mother s got a bit of a chest cold 
i m sure everyone would be happy
to see you though  one afternoon 
i should leave you to your writing 
peter 
i ll see you later then 
why didn t you tell me  charles 
you knew it wasn t any good 
why didn t you tell me  james 
you knew it wasn t any good  hm 
i took an extended lease on the theater 
keeping the actors on 
  i don t have another play 
  i m sure you will 
  won t you 
  we ll see 
i need you to sign for the storage 
mr frohman 
  lower 
  easy does it  take your time 
it was never meant to be taken seriously 
you know what happened  james 
they changed it 
  they changed what 
  the critics 
they made it important 
hm 
what s it called 
what s it called 
   play  
   play  
bang  bang  bang 
bang 
return the boy to us  you nasty lnjun 
our people teach boy lndian ways 
make him great warrior 
our chief  running nose  never let him go 
bang  bang  bang 
me wounded  peter  time s short 
you go  spread wings
and soar like eagle above enemy 
fly back to our chief 
tell her of my brave defeat 
that s crazy  indians can t fly 
of course they can  go on  go on  go on 
listen to us  boy 
this lnjun kidnapped you 
not true  we kidnap no one  you lost boy 
i teach you ways of the brave 
i take you as my own son 
you are not my father 
bang  bang  bang  bang 
  i ve got him 
  let me go 
  stop it  you two 
  ooh  we are awful  aren t we 
  i m warning you 
  oh  i m scared 
of course  you had a bit of fun
for a change 
  stop it  you two  get off 
  don t 
  jack 
  stop it 
  get off  george 
  peter 
  i m terribly sorry 
  no  it wasn t your fault 
i m afraid it might have been 
to be honest  i m just happy you got him
to join in the game 
oh  yes  i was a tremendous success 
mr barrie  it s more
than i ve been able to achieve 
peter s a different boy
since his father died 
you know  i don t think
he s even had a good cry about it 
well  grief affects us all
in different ways  doesn t it 
yes  it does 
oh  by the way  my wife would like
to invite you and the boys over to dinner 
your mother as well 
oh 
how kind  that would be lovely 
well   
don t you all look
lovely in your little suits 
and  mrs du maurier  what a shame it is
that we ve not met until this evening 
how kind of you to say so 
not at all  i can t tell you how many times
i ve been to a charity or a social event
and seen your name listed
among the organizers 
it s the very thing i would love to do myself
if i could just find the time 
my problem is in finding the time
to do everything else 
at the moment i am running
two households 
sylvia believes she can get by
without a housekeeper 
mother 
my house is quite large enough for us all 
  but the idea of living with me seems   
  not now  please  mother 
  we help her keep the house in order 
  don t interrupt  george 
  where did you get your manners 
  sorry  grandmother 
mr barrie  i understand you ve become
playmates of my grandchildren 
  oh  they indulge me  really 
  on the contrary 
the other day we took to an exploration
of darkest africa in our garden 
but mr barrie was taken ill
by the bite of a    what was it 
tsetse fly  quite horrible 
yes  and he swelled to the size
of a hippopotamus 
fingers like sausages 
and we had to float in him down the river
like he was a great bloated raft 
but the fishing was good  wasn t it 
james 
please 
  bye 
  thank you so much 
  lovely evening 
  thank you  bye 
  good night 
  good night 
well  that was a disaster 
painful 
utterly painful to see 
i don t know what you mean 
i had a lovely time 
oh  james  please 
 my problem is in finding
the time to do everything else  
  i never felt so judged in my life 
  judged  how do you mean 
a grown man  for heaven s sake 
playing all day long with children 
in any case  i hardly think they ll be
the social contact we d hoped for 
i hadn t really thought of them that way 
i just enjoy their company 
he s been a good friend to us  mother 
yes  but what does that mean  hm 
surely you don t intend   
  to keep spending your afternoons
with those children  do you 
and so today  ladies and gentlemen 
using only the wind
and his own physical strength 
george llewelyn davies shall test
the very limits of the atmosphere
using his tethered craft  go on  boy 
  go on  george 
  you re going to break it  george 
  george  stop 
  i just need a bit more speed 
i want to do it 
hold off a bit  george 
i think it s in need of a tail 
oh  wait 
  here  james  this will do 
  that s a good idea 
  no  it s not heavy enough 
  i want to do it 
  you coming  peter 
  porthos 
it ll work this time 
porthos  give us your bell  that s good 
  michael 
  yeah 
  now  would you like to give it a go 
  yes  please 
  oh  he can t run fast enough 
  of course he can 
  let him try  jack 
  now  george  you hold the kite 
george 
come on  boys  let s go back up to the top 
come on  peter 
right  george  hold it up  darling 
you ve got to run now  ready  ready 
  run  run  michael 
  run 
  oh  i told you this wasn t going to work 
  i don t think he s fast enough 
it s not going to work
if no one believes in him 
  now  give him a chance 
  michael  go back to your starting position 
  come on  darling  try again 
  george  you take the kite 
now this time  i don t want a flea s breath
of doubt  we must get that kite in the air 
right  look  i think i feel a bit
more breeze  are you ready  michael 
  you can do it  michael 
  you ve got to run  run  michael  run 
  run 
  that s it 
yes  he did it 
keep running  keep running 
what are you writing about now 
oh  just making notes 
i m never really certain what they re about
until i ve read them over later 
something about the kite 
now  why do you ask that 
i don t know 
if i were a writer i think i could tell
a whole story about flying the kite today 
perhaps you should then  that s
a fantastic idea  why not give it a try 
i hope you haven t been talking about
anything too serious with this one 
no  talking a bit of silliness really 
can we have him for supper 
have him to stay for supper  michael 
we re not cannibals 
you are welcome  you know 
sylvia  mr barrie 
where have you been 
flying a kite  mother 
and having a wonderful time 
i m sorry  i didn t know
you were coming this evening 
no  well  apparently you forgot then 
  i brought some supper along for us all 
  you didn t need to do that 
well  there s no food in the house  is there 
really  you don t need to wait
till the cupboard is bare 
please  mother  come on  darlings 
wipe feet  there s been
enough tracking round here 
george  i thought you said you were going
to help your mother take care of the house 
coat  michael  please  yes 
  and    coat hanger  good 
  will we see you tomorrow 
no  you re going to be helping
round the house tomorrow 
mother  there is absolutely no need for this 
you can t do everything yourself 
look at you  you re horribly flush 
you re wearing yourself out 
thank you for a lovely day  james 
excuse me  mother 
so from tomorrow  we re going to have
some discipline around here 
and not one of you will escape 
  good evening  mr barrie 
  good evening  sarah 
  good evening  mr barrie 
  good evening  emma 
you missed supper 
perhaps i ll have something later 
i have a bit of writing i wanted to do 
are you sure  it was a lovely meal  duck 
sarah let emma cook this evening 
is that right  listen  what would you think
of loaning emma out to the davies
for the occasional evening 
they don t actually have a cook 
i take it mrs davies enjoyed the meal
that she had here 
i imagine she could use an extra hand
now and again  that s all 
that s very charitable of you 
perhaps we can send over
some of the silver as well 
and what about linen 
i wouldn t be surprised if some of hers
was looking a bit shabby 
please  mary  stop 
maybe she can send over
some of the things we ve run short on 
my husband  for example 
we rarely see him in this house 
that hasn t seemed to bother you
for some time now 
lords and ladies  his royal highness 
king michael the benevolent 
protector of the realm 
that scepter s made of wood 
yes  well  we dream on a budget here 
don t we 
no  i mean  everyone thinks it s made
of gold  but it s just an old hunk of wood 
the means to an end  peter 
what we ve done is taken
an old hunk of wood
and transformed it for all the world to see
into the most magnificent gold 
  there you go 
  what s this 
all great writers begin with a good
leather binding and a respectable title 
open it 
 the boy castaways  
 being a record of the terrible adventures
of the brothers davies 
faithfully set forth by   
peter llewelyn davies  
kipling would swallow his own ear
for a title like that 
stab him  george  you can do it 
i still have no idea what to write 
write about anything 
write about your family 
  write about the talking whale 
  what whale 
the one that s trapped in your imagination
and desperate to get out  come sit down 
i have actually begun writing about the
adventures of the davies brothers myself 
  a play 
  a play indeed  yes 
and i would be extremely honored
if you would allow me the use of your name
for one of the characters 
i don t know what to say 
say yes 
good man 
porthos  that s mine  let go 
i won t go to bed  i won t  i won t 
you should have been in bed
half an hour ago  young man 
i m afraid i ve grown hopelessly lax
in my discipline 
nonsense  young boys
should never be sent to bed 
they always wake up a day older 
and then  before you know it 
they re grown 
their father would have been horrified 
of course  he never would have allowed
a dog in the house either 
he d have tied him up in the yard 
right  last one in bed s a hairy toad 
you mean a lot to my boys  you know 
especially peter 
it seems to me
that peter s trying to grow up too fast 
i imagine he thinks that grown ups don t
hurt as deeply as children do when they   
when they lose someone 
i lost my elder brother  david 
when i was just peter s age 
and it nearly destroyed my mother 
james  i m so sorry 
your poor mother 
i can t imagine losing a child 
aye 
she didn t get out of bed for months 
she wouldn t eat 
i tried everything to make her happy  but   
she only wanted david 
so   
one day   
i dressed myself in david s clothing
and i went to her 
you must have frightened her to death 
i think it was the first time
she ever actually    looked at me 
and that was the end of the boy james 
i used to say to myself
he d gone to neverland 
where 
neverland  it s a wonderful place 
i ve not spoken about this before
to anyone 
ever 
what s it like    neverland 
one day i ll take you there 
wait a minute  james 
he s a fairy 
er  no  he s the irrepressible
spirit of youth  tinker bell is the fairy 
  tinker bell is a woman 
  she s not a woman  she s a fairy 
he is a boy who stays young forever 
james  how does anyone
stay young forever  it doesn t work 
he just believes  charles 
he imagines life the way he wants it to be 
and he believes in it long enough and hard
enough that it all appears before him  see 
james  i m your friend 
you re coming off a flop 
  you have a man who is a fairy 
  no  a boy who has a fairy 
and this girl calls herself tinker 
and you have a pirate ship on stage
surrounded by tons and tons of water 
  that s a lot of water 
  it s a lot of water 
  yes  and that s a lot of money 
  it is  but we can fake the water 
oh  well  if we can fake the water
then i m sure your play will be a hit 
you know what i think i ll do  i think
i ll imagine life the way i want it to be   
long enough and hard enough 
yes  and then the money for the play
will appear magically before me 
  that s right  that s it 
  yes 
how does the clock wind up
inside the crocodile 
  he swallows it 
  ah  of course he does 
out 
how was he 
  well done 
  good show 
i finally get the courage
to invite the boys to a game
and we have to suffer
this grave humiliation 
it s perfect actually 
spend a good deal of time with them 
don t you 
every moment i can spare  in fact 
i m glad for you 
and mrs davies seems to be
having a good time of it as well 
you should be aware though  james 
what some people have been saying 
mind you  i wouldn t bring it up
if i thought the rumors would pass 
i m not surprised  what are they saying 
very well 
that you spend much more time with mrs
davies than you do with your own wife 
she s a widow  and   
and a friend  that s it  nothing more 
there have also been questions about
how you spend your time with those boys 
and why 
that s outrageous  how could anyone
think something so evil 
they re children 
they re innocent children 
you find a glimmer of happiness
in this world 
there s always someone
who wants to destroy it 
no  thank you  arthur  but i don t think
many will give credence to such nonsense 
then why is no one sitting with them 
once you get a bit of notoriety  james 
people watch you and they will
look for ways to drag you down 
are you sure your wife doesn t
object to us taking over your cottage
for the summer  james 
  she doesn t go there anymore 
  really 
it s such a relief to get away 
you ll come and visit  i hope 
  of course  are we in 
  everyone in 
  can i drive  uncle jim 
  er  no 
out of the way
or i ll make haggis out of you 
get the sheep out the way 
  are we there yet 
  almost  almost there 
i can see the cottage 
  shall we explore  michael 
  don t tear your clothes  please 
  come on  follow me 
  be careful of stinging nettles 
hurry up  everyone 
  would you like to see the rest of it 
  mm  yes 
 ello 
thought you could escape
from captain swarthy  eh 
off to the ship with you  then 
off to the ship  son 
so now you can either choose
to become a pirate with the rest of us 
or we ll toss you to the sharks 
  how marvelous 
  well  maybe the crocodiles  eh 
  no one s escaped  captain 
  excellent work  matey 
now then 
now is your only chance to speak 
who amongst you is ready
to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea 
  i am 
  not finished yet 
to enter upon
the most dangerous chapter
in your young
and soon to be wasted lives 
what did you say  what are doing  son 
are you giggling  on my ship 
giggling  what did you say 
  i said i m ready  captain 
  what s your name  boy 
i m curly  the oldest and wisest of the crew 
cut him loose  matey 
welcome aboard  curly 
your job will be to mop the deck 
and who be you  young squire 
my name be nibs the cut throat  feared
by men and greatly desired by the ladies 
jack 
welcome aboard  nibs 
you shall polish all wood surfaces 
grab a hold of that rigging 
  and you  lad 
  i m peter 
that s not a pirate name 
what about dastardly jim  eh 
no  just peter 
i like my name 
very well 
in punishment for lack of an interesting
pirate name  peter shall walk the plank 
cut him loose 
  what are you playing again 
  the boy 
what have you got     excuse me 
mr barrie  sir 
there s been a mistake here  sir 
it says here i m to play the nanny 
  i don t imagine i quite fit that part  eh 
  you re not actually the nanny 
you re a dog 
  what 
  a newfound land 
we ll put you in a great big fluffy dog suit 
rrr 
oh  right 
actually  we don t have a tinker bell cast 
do we  he could play tinker bell 
heavens  no  tinker bell s a light 
it moves around the stage 
just a wee light
that moves around the stage 
bit worried about this 
let s see 
we ve got john darling  michael darling 
tiger lily  smee  skylights 
it s a play for puppets 
tootles  nibs  curly 
all these names are absurd
when you see them all together 
captain hook  s   
oh  hello  james 
you re out of your mind 
how were rehearsals 
fine  great  they re going    quite well 
  good 
  yes  thank you 
  hello 
  hello 
  how was your journey 
  it was quite long  i m exhausted 
  let s get you some tea 
  that d be nice  thanks 
  can you come to the playhouse 
  in a moment  michael  he s just arrived 
but i said i d get him  they always
send peter to do things  i said i ll do it 
  it will spoil the surprise 
  what surprise  darling 
it s a great surprise  we ve taken
most of the day preparing for it 
  everybody s waiting for you 
  then we mustn t keep them waiting 
please don t tell them that i told you
the surprise  i said i wouldn t 
oh  well  you didn t really tell us
anything about it  did you 
  yes i did  it s a play 
  it s a play 
 the lamentable tale of lady ursula  
 a play in one act
by peter llewelyn davies  
  this is just a bit of silliness  really 
  i should hope so  go on 
i just wanted to take a stab at writing 
you know 
well  the others do
a good job with it anyway 
well  let s see it then 
 the lamentable tale of lady ursula  
 one morning  just after sunrise 
lady ursula  the most beautiful daughter
of lord and lady dubon 
made her way up the steps of the great
cathedral to pray to her blessed saint  
 suddenly  as she reached
the cathedral doors 
the gargoyle that guarded
the sacred structure
came to life and swooped down upon her  
 the people of the village all ran to safety 
but lady ursula slipped
on the cathedral steps
and the gargoyle descended upon her 
wrapping her in its huge wings
and taking her high up into the spires
of the cathedral  
  go on  peter 
   not long after this sorrowful event 
a young knight named jm barnaby
came into the city  
sylvia 
  do you want some water 
  mother 
  no  james 
  let s get her back to the house  go on 
she won t discuss it with me at all 
she claims it was nothing 
i tell you  doctor  she couldn t breathe 
you can t very well treat a patient
who won t admit there s anything wrong 
well  you ll have to make her understand
that something is 
  i ll try and do my best 
  great  just there 
get your hand flat like that 
ow 
then    like that 
come in 
the good doctor didn t feel
up to the challenge on this one 
he thinks you need to go to hospital
for further tests 
nonsense 
when would i have time for that 
besides  this family s
had enough of hospitals 
  perhaps they can help you 
  i know what they can do for me 
i saw what they did for my husband 
no  james  i ve no interest in hospitals 
i m keenly interested
in having some supper 
what did you and mother decide
to tell us this time   it s only a chest cold  
  we hadn t decided anything 
  stop lying to me 
i m sick of grown ups lying to me 
i m not lying to you 
i don t know what s wrong 
 father might take us fishing  
that s what she said   ln just a few weeks  
and he died the next morning 
that wasn t a lie  peter 
that was your mother s hope 
he barely moved for a week 
but i started planning our fishing trip 
i will never lie to you  i promise you that 
no  all you ll do is teach me
to make up stupid stories
and pretend that things
aren t happening until   
i won t  i m not blind 
i won t be made a fool 
what s this  peter 
the play 
darling  i wanted to see the rest of it 
magic s gone out of it a bit now 
hasn t it 
all because of a silly chest cold 
james 
well  you remember gilbert cannan 
don t you 
good evening 
mr cannan has been working on the
committee to fight government censorship 
i know how involved you ve been as well 
he wanted to speak to you 
i did think you d be home so much sooner 
it s been a long evening  mary 
yes 
well  if i d realized how late it was 
of course 
i should perhaps talk to you
at another time  not so late 
that will be fine 
we ll talk then 
thank you for your patience  mrs barrie 
mr barrie 
  good night 
  night 
well  aren t you going to speak 
what would you like me to say 
 curious how late mr cannan stayed  
i suppose 
and then  let s see  what comes next 
 no later than you were out  james  
 and how is mrs davies this evening  
oh  yes  i would have a great answer
for that one  wouldn t i 
how dare you 
this isn t one of your plays 
i know that  mary  it s quite serious 
but i m not ready for this conversation 
wherever it may lead 
perhaps we can talk in the morning  yes 
good night then 
mr barrie  don t you agree
this is a little bit tight 
  no  no  in fact i think it s quite    baggy 
  baggy 
quite frumpy  i d bring it
right in just there 
that s very tight 
and put maybe a plank of wood there
to straighten him up 
  oh  aye  yes  mr barrie 
  plank of wood 
some wood there on the shoulders as well 
  otherwise  it s marvelous 
  right  sir 
  you ll be sick tomorrow 
  i ll be sick tonight 
james 
we re just having some tea 
you remember my mother  of course 
yes  of course  how do you do 
  may i take your hat 
  that s enough  boys 
boys  please don t run in the house 
you ll break something 
come away from that door 
come on  come on 
  i d like a word with you 
mr barrie  before you go 
we ll only be a few minutes 
boys  why don t you go
and play in the garden  go on 
  is he in trouble 
  sh 
because i ve been alone with grandmother
and i know what it s like 
  should we retire into the study 
  why don t you join them  dear 
very well 
  i do apologize for interrupting 
  would you close the door  please 
certainly 
sylvia has told me you have offered her
the services of your household staff 
  well  not exactly 
  that won t be necessary 
i ll leave that to sylvia  of course 
you ll leave that to me  mr barrie 
you see  i m moving in here from now on 
  you re moving in 
  i m going where i m most needed 
and i can certainly see to it
that this house is managed
without resorting to your charity 
it isn t charity  mrs du maurier 
i was only trying to help  as a friend 
have you no idea how much your
friendship has already cost my daughter 
or are you really that selfish 
i beg your pardon 
don t you see what a visit
to the summer cottage of a married man
does for a widow s future prospects 
sylvia needs to find someone 
the boys need a father 
and you are destroying any hope this
family has of pulling itself together again 
i have only wanted good things
for this family  mrs du maurier 
i ll look after them 
you have your own family
to concern yourself with 
what are you suggesting 
i m suggesting that you protect
what you have  mr barrie 
that is precisely what i am doing 
i was so certain what i would find in this 
some little confession
would leak out onto the page 
i don t write love notes in my journal 
no 
still  you knew who i meant  didn t you 
that s some comfort  actually 
it means i know you just a little after all 
you needn t steal my journal
to get to know me  mary 
no  i suppose i could just go see the plays 
i was hopelessly naive when i married you 
i imagined that brilliant people
disappeared to some secret place
where good ideas floated around
like leaves in autumn 
and i hoped  at least once   
you would take me there with you 
there is no such place 
yes  there is 
neverland 
it s the best you ve written  james 
and i m sure the davies will adore
the world you ve created for them 
i only wish i were part of it 
i ve wanted you to be  i ve tried 
mary 
i always imagined us going off on
great adventures once we were together 
but we moved into this house
and you started  i don t know 
  you started rearranging the furniture 
  what was i supposed to do  james 
you were always gone 
i was right here 
sitting in your parlor  staring off
into other worlds as though i didn t exist 
look  just give me bit more time
to finish up the play 
to spend with your muse 
no  i m tired of waiting  james 
i m tired of looking like a fool 
well  i can t very well give up the play 
of course not 
just come home to me at the end of
the day  rehearse and be home for dinner 
no more trips to the country 
no more long afternoons in the park 
if you can t give us that much of a chance 
then we must end this 
and i will 
pitiful display 
nanny  nanny 
what 
first you get the pajamas 
then you make the bed 
with my paws 
you make the bed with your paws 
the pajamas you get with your teeth 
because in fact  being a dog 
you haven t any proper digits  have you 
well  i don t have any teeth  either 
i mean  i can t see  i can t breathe 
all i ve got is this rubbery snout 
  can we get him some teeth 
  he can have mine 
we ll get you teeth 
  let s have a wee break  shall we 
  right 
  i thought you were wonderful 
  you were marvelous 
i think you re better on four legs
than you are on two 
  oh  give it a rest 
  i do 
  just say it  charles  go on 
  well  you picture it  james 
opening night  doctors  lawyers 
businessmen and their wives 
all dressed to the nines 
they ve paid good money  they re
expecting theater  what we call theater 
the curtain opens and it s crocodiles
and fairies and pirates and lndians 
i don t even know what it is 
but you did know  charles  you re
an absolute genius  charles  that s it 
oh  don t patronize me  james 
you know how much money i put into
this show that i haven t even found yet 
listen  listen  opening night 
i want 25 seats set aside 
  set aside  25 
  25 seats 
scattered throughout the theater 
two here  two there  three up there 
  are they paying for it 
  they re filled 
  no  no  no  i m asking   
  the seats are filled 
  uncle jim 
  hello  boys 
could i speak to you for a moment 
please 
certainly 
25 seats  charles  it ll be great 
it ll be fantastic 
25 scattered seats 
who s paying for them 
throughout the theater 
  who s paying for these 25 seats 
  they re filled up seats  charles 
whoa  look 
this is great  i m flying 
we don t need to use much pull at all  see 
as long as we ve got the balance down 
mother asked me to take the boys out
for the afternoon 
she said she only wanted a bit of quiet 
but she was trembling so badly
she couldn t even finish her tea 
i m not a fool  uncle james 
i deserve to know the truth 
i don t know the truth 
she won t talk about it 
but you think it s serious 
it could be  the doctor felt
she should go and have some tests 
then you ll have to convince her
to go then 
i ve tried  she won t listen to me 
and lately  to be quite honest 
it seems that all my best intentions for
your family have come to nothing but harm 
apparently i ve made
quite a mess of things 
it s grandmother  isn t it 
she s run you off  hasn t she 
oh  she s absolutely tried with great
effort  and perhaps with good reason 
it isn t you  uncle jim  she just   
she just doesn t want
to see mother hurt anymore 
look at that 
how magnificent 
the boy s gone 
somewhere during the last 30 seconds 
you ve become a grown up 
right then  i think you should be the one
to talk to her  george 
  but i wouldn t know what to say 
  you ll do fine  you ll do just fine 
mr barrie  sir  sorry to interrupt 
  it s nana  he s expired backstage 
  what s happened 
i think his costume is too tight 
it s not possible  too tight 
george  give me a minute  i ll be back 
pull that one tight 
here  last one 
ok  flap those wings 
  there you go 
  whoa 
  can i have a go 
  yeah  you can have a little go if you want 
give that a tug  go on

  george 
mr barrie 
mrs davies would like a word with you 
no  just mr barrie 
  did you encourage this 
  encourage what 
oh  james  please 
you know perfectly well what 
george won t allow them to set his arm
unless i submit to an examination 
i see  well  i suppose you ll have to then 
because he s quite a stubborn young man
when he sets his mind to it 
this is absurd 
they won t tell me anything different 
different 
so you ve already spoken to a doctor then 
that is not your concern 
my understanding is that my condition
may be quite serious 
however    my wish is that
life should go on as normal 
so 
i ll have the examination 
and i ll take whatever medications
they advise 
but i don t want to know what they re for 
and i don t want you inquiring into it
any further 
wouldn t dream of it 
mary 
mary 
peter  could you help george
to fold a pocket handkerchief  please 
  they re in the linen cupboard  darling

i don t think we need to include you in
everything that goes on in this household 
  but she d want to see him

you ve seen fit to conceal certain facts
about my daughter s condition from me 
i feel no remorse at excluding you
from my home 
but you can t   
  go upstairs  george  now 
  stop ordering me about 
this isn t your home  it s our home 
just cos mother s
needed your help recently

boys  would you give me a moment
with your mother  please  thank you 
they can see it  you know 
you can t go on just pretending 
 just pretending  
you brought pretending
into this family  james 
you showed us we can change things
by simply believing them to be different 
a lot of things  sylvia  not everything 
but the things that matter 
we ve pretended for some time now
that you re a part of this family  haven t we 
you ve come to mean so much to us all
that now it doesn t matter if it s true 
and even if it isn t true 
even if that can never be   
i need to go on pretending 
until the end 
with you 
  oh  i am sweet 
  how do you do it

out of his hands and floated away

evening i ve ever spent in the theater 
very kind of you to say  thank you 
where s mr snow this evening 
oh 
i m afraid he s left us 
and he would so have loved this evening 
the pirates and the lndians 
he was really just a boy himself  you know 
to the very end 
i m terribly sorry  how are you doing 
i m doing well enough now  thank you 
i suppose it s all the work
of the ticking crocodile  isn t it 
time is chasing after all of us 
isn t that right 
  that s right  mrs snow 
  aunt rose  your drink 
thank you  i mustn t keep you 
you ve a lot of friends here 
well  it s lovely to see you 
i m terribly sorry  once again 
  was that mr barrie 
  that was mr barrie 
well done  mr barrie 
  good show 
  well done 
psst 
what did you think 
  it s about our summer together  isn t it 
  it is 
  about all of us 
  that s right 
did you like it 
it s magical  thank you 
oh  thank you 
thank you  peter 
  this is peter pan  how wonderful 
  really 
you re peter pan  why  you must be
quite the little adventurer 
look  it s true 
he has no shadow 
but i m not peter pan 
he is 
and there s been no improvement
since my last visit 
no 
has james been by at all today  mother 
dr brighton  may i have a word 
excuse me a moment 
you haven t been keeping him from me 
have you 
as a matter of fact 
i actually hoped he might come 
would have proved me wrong about him 
of course  with the success of his play 
the whole of london
must be knocking at his door 
i m sorry  dear 
  what is it 
  it s a secret 
  quiet  michael 
  i didn t say anything 
mother  could you come downstairs
for a moment 
oh  she can t come downstairs 
what are you thinking of  george 
actually  i think a trip downstairs
might do her good  ma am 
  what have you been up to 
  just wait and see 
it s a play 
it s not just a play  michael 
it s the play 
of course  we ll have to make do
with a few compromises 
much of it will have to be imagined 
  as it should be 
  as it should be  that s right 
michael  come and sit here 
next to mum 
when you re ready 
i won t go to bed  i won t  i won t 
nana  it isn t six o clock yet 
two minutes more  please 
  you know fairies  peter 
  yes 
but they re nearly all dead now 
you see  wendy  when the first baby
laughed for the first time 
the laugh broke into a thousand pieces
and they all went skipping about
and that was the beginning of fairies 
and now when every new baby is born 
its first laugh becomes a fairy 
so there ought to be one fairy
for every boy and girl 
  ought to be  lsn t there 
  oh  no 
children know such a lot now 
soon  they don t believe in fairies 
and every time a child says 
 l don t believe in fairies  
there s a fairy somewhere
that falls down dead 
who is that 
the redskins were defeated 
wendy and the boys
captured by the pirates 
i ll rescue her  i ll rescue her 
oh  that s just my medicine 
poisoned  who could have poisoned it 
why  tink  you ve drunk my medicine 
it was poisoned 
and you drank it to save my life 
tink 
are you dying 
her light is growing faint 
if it goes out  that means she s dead 
her voice is so low i can scarcely hear
what she s saying 
she says she thinks
she could get well again
if children believed in fairies 
do you believe in fairies 
say quick that you believe 
if you believe  clap your hands 
clap louder 
thank you  thank you 
that is neverland 
so many perfect days 
i really began to believe
we d go on like that forever 
oh  stop it 
she wasn t going to stay with you forever 
she had a husband  my father 
she never cared for you
the way she did for him 
i m not trying to replace your father  peter 
i could never do that 
you d best let him go 
george  would you take the boys back
to the house  i ll be with you in a moment 
go on  dear 
i m terribly sorry 
i ve ruined everything i ve touched
in this family 
stop giving yourself so much credit 
peter s grieving 
it has nothing to do with you 
perhaps if i just had
a bit more time with him 
no  mr barrie  that won t be good enough 
if  a bit more time  is all you can provide 
you d better leave him alone 
i know you don t much care for me 
mrs du maurier  and i respect that 
but i loved your daughter very much 
and i love those boys 
and i think they need me right now 
is that so 
and for how long after 
meaning what 
sylvia has requested a co guardianship
for the boys in her will 
you  mr barrie  and myself 
  and what do you have to say about that 
  i shall respect my daughter s wishes 
something i should have done more of
while she was alive 
but if you feel you re not ready
for such a commitment 
i assure you i can certainly
look after the boys by myself 
do you think i could abandon those boys 
sit down  peter 
mother pasted it back together
after i ruined it 
and then i saw the play 
i just started writing
and i haven t been able to stop 
she would be very pleased to know that 
listen  i ve just spoken
with your grandmother
and i m staying 
for good 
i m sorry i was so horrible 
don t worry 
it s just   
i thought she d always be here 
so did i 
but  in fact   
she is 
because she s on every page
of your imagination 
you ll always have her there  always 
but why did she have to die 
i don t know  boy 
when i think of your mother   
i will always remember
how happy she looked
sitting there in the parlor 
watching a play about her family 
about her boys that never grew up 
she went to neverland 
and you can visit her any time you like
