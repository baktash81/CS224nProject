and puts away childish things
childhood is the kingdom
where nobody dies
jake jacob
phil
its happening
you just have to break them in
ive been breaking them in for three days
can l just go barefoot
no absolutely not
just thinking its a little much you know
the dress and the shoes
and all of this
no its exactly enough
tomorrow will be perfect
where do you want them boss
on either side of the aisle
what aisle
does no one have vision
you go home and get lots of beauty sleep
thats an order
okay
l was just checking for cold feet
well mine are toasty warm
its not too late to change your mind
what now youre having second thoughts
you are
no ive been waiting a century
to marry you miss swan
but
l havent told you everything about myself
what youre not a virgin
look you cant scare me away now
look a few years after carlisle created me
l rebelled against him
l resented him for curbing my appetite
and so for a while l went off on my own
l wanted to know how it felt to hunt
to taste human blood
all the men i killed
were monsters
and so was i
edward they were all murderers
you probably saved more lives
than you took
bella thats what l told myself
but they were all human beings
l looked into their eyes as they died
and l saw who l was
and what l was capable of
and what ill be capable of
why are you telling me this tonight
did you really think
this was gonna change my mind about you
l just wondered
if it would change your mind about yourself
and who you wanna see when
you look in the mirror a year from now
l know l can do this
let me tell you why
because you did
you should give yourself
some credit for that
now hopefully a year from now
im gonna look in the mirror
and see someone like you
l mean someone capable of courage
and sacrifice and love
what is that
come on lets go
im late for my bachelor party
send him out bella
or were coming in after him
so this party
will there be strippers
no just a couple of mountain lions
maybe a few bears
dont worry bella
well give him back in plenty of time
okay go before they break my house
lets go lets go
ill meet you at the altar
ill be the one in white
that was very convincing
what did l say about beauty sleep
sorry bad dream
lt was wedding jitters
do you need some help
l could do her hair
really

im not offended by your choice of groom
just my blatant lack of respect for mortality
essentially
weddings they bring everyone together

london by night

baby when i am laid to rest
may my laughter remain
like your kiss blew me away
answer your spirit
i gotta know right now
i see you before me
wont you show me how
alice
i wear my hair fizzy
i dont copy no style
but kissing and ascrubbing
it has consequences
youre on the bus again
past big ben
with your rip off oyster card
dont be a coward
gotas mínimas
caudales de agua
youre so beautiful
agua lisa
l promised that wed try
if this doesnt work
l trust you
tu vida
ive waited a hundred years
but id wait a million more
for you
nothing prepared me
for the privilege of being yours
its okay
if i had only felt the warmth
within your touch
if i had only seen
how you smile when you blush
or how you curl your lip
when you concentrate enough
i would have known what i was living for
what ive been living for
your love is my turning page
only the sweetest words remain
every kiss is a cursive line
every touch is a redefining phrase
i surrender who ive been for who you are
nothing makes me stronger
than your fragile heart
if i had only felt how it feels to be yours
i would have known
how badly are you hurt
what
no bella look
bella l cant tell you how sorry l am
im not
really im not im fine
dont say youre fine
just dont
no you dont
dont ruin this
ive already ruined it
why cant you see
how perfectly happy l am
or was five seconds ago
l mean now im sort of pissed off actually
you should be angry with me
l mean
we knew this was gonna be tricky right
l think we did amazing
l mean it was amazing for me
thats what youre worried about
that l didnt enjoy myself
l know its not the same for you
but for a human l cant imagine
that it gets any better than that
last night
was the best night of my existence
youre the best
youre not gonna touch me again are you
you know thats not what l mean
let me make you breakfast
dreamed last night about a time and place
where from our troubles we had escape
i held your hand and i felt complete
as you turned and said to me
from now on
from now on well be
you and me
we will be
from now on
from now on well be
you and me
you and me
we will be
only a dream
from now on
only a dream
from now on
only a dream
from now on
only a dream
from now on
you and me we will be
l win
bella
you having a nightmare
no
lt was just a dream
lt was a really good dream
then why are you crying
because l wanted it to be real
tell me
bella l cant
please
maybe theyll say
she was in a car crash
or tripped and fell off a cliff
keep it in play keep it in play
come on
come on come on
at least ill get one thing out of it
no you wont
cullens are not a danger
to the town or the tribe
well hes either gonna kill her
or change her
and the treaty says
l say jacob
l say
you know if you wanted things different
you shouldve become alpha
turning it down seemed like a good idea
at the time
jake you really think you could kill bella
if she comes back a vampire
no make one of us do it
then hold a grudge against us
shut up leah
would you just get over it
its not like youve imprinted on her
at least they seem happy
yeah some people are just lucky l guess
lucky
none of them
belong to themselves anymore
and the sickest part is
their genes tell them theyre happy about it
least if you imprinted on someone
youd finally forget about bella
l mean being any kind of happy is better
than being miserable
about someone you cant have
bella these are our housekeepers
gustavo and kaure
this is my wife bella
excuse me
well l guess we just leave them to it
what was that all about
shes afraid for you
why
because l have you here all alone
you mean she knows about you
she suspects
shes native ticuna they have legends
about blooddrinking demons
who prey on beautiful women
hey
youre late
bella
hey dont come in here
you dont need to see this
in sickness and health remember
lt must have been the chicken
could you grab my bag
what is it
how many days has it been
since the wedding
fourteen why
will you tell me whats going on
im late
my period its late
thats impossible
can this happen
whoa
alice
bella
are you all right
im not 100 sure
why whats wrong i just
you just what
alice what did you see
heres carlisle
bella whats going on
l dont know im a little worried
can vampires go into shock
has edward been harmed
no
l know that its impossible
but l think that im pregnant
whoa
carlisle l swear
something just moved inside me
ls this even possible
i dont know
whats he saying
the sooner bellas here
the sooner we can find out what it is
i need you to get to the mainland at once
yeah yeah l will
well
damn it
kaures making sure youre still alive
slow we paddle through the lake
straight to the very center
of the darkest water
where we can embrace
the shadows on the surface
the eyes that look up lifeless
from our twins below
and though your arms and legs are under
love will be the echo in your ears
when all is lost and plundered
my love will be there still
true its chilling to behold
up close we stumble back
what did you do with her
what do you know about this
l know that you are a demon
you killed this little girl
what
her people have legends
she might have seen this before
please
tell me how to help her
you only do bad
l am begging you
l will do anything
l love her
please
tell me how she can survive this
death
im not gonna let it hurt you
carlisle will get that thing out
thing
wait here while we load
hello
rosalie
bella
whats going on
l need your help
hey son
whats going on
bella called him
hey havent seen you in a while
you okay
so you finally heard from bella
theyre extending their trip
seems she caught a bug
they wanna wait until she feels better
before they travel
shes sick
yeah she told me not to worry
but she sounded
l dont know off
shell be okay charlie
come on lets eat
jacob let it go
ls it true
hello jacob how are you
listen just give it to me straight
jake is that you
shes here
they came home two weeks ago
jake
im glad you came
close enough
whats your problem
rose its okay
you look terrible
yeah its nice to see you too
so are you gonna tell me
whats wrong with you
rose you wanna help me up
you did this
we didnt know it was even possible
what is it
im not sure
ultrasounds and needles
wont penetrate the embryonic sac
l cant see it either
and l cant see bellas future anymore
weve been researching legends
but there isnt much to go on
what we do know is that its strong
and fastgrowing
why havent you done anything
take it out of her
this is none of your business dog
rose
all this fighting isnt good for bella
the fetus isnt good for bella
say the word alice baby
its just a little baby
possibly
carlisle youve gotta do something
no
its not his decision its not any of yours
jacob l need to talk to you
l always knew youd destroy her
she thinks carlisle can turn her
at the last minute
like he did for me and esme
can he
probability is slight
and if her heart fails
look jacob
l need you to do something for me
for her
you have a connection with her
that ill never understand
maybe you could talk to her
change her mind
you can keep her alive
and if l cant
if she dies
you get what you always wanted
to kill me
rose im fine really
so edward sent you in here to talk to me
sort of
though l cant figure out
why he thinks youd listen to me
l mean you never have before
since when are you and blondie bffs
rose understands what l want
what are you thinking bella
seriously
l know this seems like a scary thing
but its not
its like this miracle or something
l can feel him
so its a bouncing baby boy
im sorry l didnt know
shouldve brought some blue balloons
its just a guess
when l picture him l see a boy
well see
you wont
jake l can do this
im strong enough
come on
you can spout that crap to your
bloodsucker but you dont fool me
l can see what that things doing to you
its a killer bella
youre wrong
and when you die
what was the point
of me loving you you loving him
how is that right for anyone
because l sure dont see it
listen to me bella
please
just dont do this
live okay
please
jake everythings gonna be okay
jacob dont go
l know how this ends
and im not sticking around to watch
jacob
jake i can do this i can do this
dont do this
im strong enough
im strong enough
this is none
of your business dog
jacob dont go
you did this
everythings gonna be okay
the fetus isnt good for bella
i know how this ends
dont you even care that its killing you
jake jake jake
jake jake jake
is it true jacob
what will it be
its growing fast
its unnatural
dangerous
monstrosity
an abomination
on our land
we cant allow it
we cant allow it
we cant allow it
we cant allow it
we have to protect the tribe
what theyve bred
wont be able to control its thirst
every human will be in danger
were ready
no time to waste
now
we must destroy it before its born
you mean kill bella
her choice affects us all
bellas human
our protection applies to her
shes dying anyway
we have real enemies to fight tonight
tonight
you will fight with us jake
l will not
i am the grandson of ephraim black
i am the grandson of a chief
i wasnt born to follow you or anyone else
whoa
dont worry theyre not following us
what do you think youre doing here
l left sams pack
go home seth
l wont stand behind him
oh yes you will
im not kidding get out of here
ls that an order
gonna make me bow down too
im not ordering anyone
look im just going off
on my own here okay
great and ive got your back
no you dont
if sam comes after bella
are you really ready
to fight your own brothers
your sister
if its the right thing to do
whatever
im gonna go give the cullens a headsup
do what you want
how cool is this twoman pack
two against the world
youre getting on my nerves seth
ill shut up can do
get ready
theyre coming for bella
theyre not gonna touch her
agreed
man l can smell them
from all the way out here
what the hell are you doing here
im not gonna let my little brother
get himself killed
go away leah l can take care of myself
that you think so
proves you need a babysitter
okay would the both of you shut up
did sam send you
sam doesnt even know l left
l think he just figured it out
jake
l know what his plan is
sams lost the element of surprise
and he doesnt want
to take you on outnumbered
so hes not gonna come at you head on
hes got the place surrounded
and hell wait for his opportunity
we wont get through without a fight
no fights
we wont be the ones to break the treaty
the treaty is void at least in sams mind
not in ours
carlisle no ones hunted for weeks
well make do
youve done us a great service jacob
thank you
l know theyre out there somewhere
but l cant hear them anymore
its so quiet
l stopped hearing them too
the second l decided to leave
its nice
you know you cant stay here
but l dont have any place
l cant trust you with the cullens
you hate them too much
you dont even like me
l dont have to
l just have to follow you
look seth doesnt want you here
neither do l
being unwanted isnt exactly
a new thing for me
look ill stay out of your way
ill do whatever you want
except go back to sams pack and be the
pathetic exgirlfriend he cant get away from
you dont know how many times
l wished l could imprint on someone
anyone
just to break the connection
all right
im gonna do a perimeter run
you got my flank
god and his priests and his kings
all will wait
as they go on
mmmmmm
held between heaven and hell
as theyre dancing
as they dont
cold
your rib is cracked
but there are no splinters
you havent punctured anything
yet
edward
its breaking her bones now
its crushing you from the inside out
carlisle tell her what you told me tell her
carlisle tell me its all right
the fetus isnt compatible with your body
its too strong
lt wont allow you to get
the nutrition you need
its starving you by the hour
l cant stop it and l cant slow it down
at this rate your heart will give out
before you can deliver
then ill hold on as long as l can and then
bella
there are some conditions
that even venom cant overcome
you understand
im sorry
edward im sorry
l cant live without you
you wont youre gonna have a part of me
hell need you
do you honestly think that l could love it
or even tolerate it if it killed you
its not his fault
you have to accept what is
because youve given me no choice
bella were supposed to be partners
remember
but you decided this on your own
youve decided to leave me
dont see it that way
well l have no other way to see it
cause its me wholl lose you
and l dont choose that
l dont choose that
cold
sing for the lion and lamb
yours completely
yours
as we go over
sing for the lion and lamb
washington driving in the red zone
almost stripped of the ball
he stood up and calvin finally
are you cold
l got it
dont do that
what
smile like im your favorite person
in the world
youre one of them
feels complete when youre here jake
we need to find a way
to get some food into her system
if l could only see the fetus
the baby
maybe l could figure out what it wants
think you might be right
jacob just had an idea
lt wasnt an idea lt was a snide comment
what were you thinking
that its probably just looking for someone
to sink its teeth into
hes thirsty
l know the feeling
if its craving
its not gonna want animal blood
l have some o negative laid aside for bella
walk with me
wait wait wait
youre gonna make her drink that
its the fastest way to test the theory
only if youre comfortable with it
ill try anything
just hold on
l think im gonna be sick
this might make it a little easier to take
tastes
good
mmm
your pulse is already getting stronger
its working
well you sound better
l am
l feel much better
this whole thing mustve put a kink
in the honeymoon huh
you could say that
otherwise married life treating you okay
edward still walks on water and all that
yeah but l mean it is different now
the important thing is that youre better
and that youre coming home soon right
okay dad l dont want you to freak out
but im going to a medical center
in switzerland
what no no youre not
youre not going to switzerland
what are you you said you were better

we need to go tonight
carlisle youre the enemy now
sam wont hesitate you will be slaughtered
emmett will come with us
that wont be enough
we have no choice jacob
if theres anything we can do to save her
we have to try

l can see that
this really is a family
as strong as the one l was born into

sitting pretty uptightly
the knots keep you at my side
upstairs in corners
eyes blink for the crawl
up and out
my beacon will choke
if yours is taken
i dare four more lines
four more lines
sellotape an end to
sellotape an end
hover thought
mosquito
bite down
my fickle hands machine
surprises
sellotape an end to a story that is hanging
over silence always wasted
swells with every teardrop
pulls my threads to kid gloves
sellotape an end to this
now im the guilty one
hey
give me my sentence
ill pay my penance
let me kill them all
and the pain i have for hurting you
i didnt mean it
ah its from carlisle
which is spelt with an s sweet bianca
hes added a new member to his coven
ah
increasing his power
first its the spelling
then the grammar
at least our dispute with the cullens is over
over
mmm
goodness no
our dispute goes far beyond
the fate of a mere human
and what might it be
why brother l thought you understood
they have something l want
if you ever leave me baby
leave some morphine at my door
cause it would take
a whole lot of medication
to realize what we used to have
we dont have it anymore
theres no religion that could save me
no matter how long
my knees are on the floor
so keep in mind all the sacrifices im making
will keep you by my side
will keep you from walking out the door
cause therell be no sunlight
if i lose you baby
therell be no clear skies
if i lose you baby
just like the clouds
my eyes will do the same
if you walk away
every day it will rain rain rain
ill never be your mothers favorite
your daddy cant even look me in the eye
if i was in their shoes
id be doing the same thing
saying there goes my little girl
walking with that troublesome guy
but theyre just afraid
of something they cant understand
but little darling
watch me change their minds
yeah for you ill try ill try ill try ill try
ill pick up these broken pieces
till im bleeding
if thatll make you mine
cause therell be no sunlight
if i lose you baby
therell be no clear skies
if i lose you baby
just like the clouds
my eyes will do the same
if you walk away
every day it will rain rain rain
dont just say goodbye
ill pick up these broken pieces
till im bleeding
if thatll make it right
cause therell be no sunlight
if i lose you baby
therell be no clear skies
if i lose you baby
just like the clouds
my eyes will do the same
if you walk away
every day it will rain rain rain
heart beats fast
colors and promises
how to be brave
how can i love when im afraid
to fall
but watching you stand alone
all of my doubt
suddenly goes away somehow
one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling dont be afraid
i have loved you
for a thousand years
ill love you for a thousand more
time stands still
beauty in all she is
i will be brave
i will not let anything take away
whats standing in front of me
every breath
every hour has come to this
one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling dont be afraid
i have loved you
for a thousand years
ill love you for a thousand more
and all along i believed i would find you
time has brought your heart to me
i have loved you
for a thousand years
ill love you for a thousand more
one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling dont be afraid
i have loved you
for a thousand years
ill love you for a thousand more
