and puts away childish things 
 childhood is the kingdom
where nobody dies  
jake  jacob 
phil 
it s happening 
you just have to break them in 
i ve been breaking them in  for three days 
can l just go barefoot 
no  absolutely not 
just thinking it s a little much  you know 
the dress and the shoes 
and all of this 
no  it s exactly enough 
tomorrow will be perfect 
where do you want them  boss 
on either side of the aisle 
 what aisle 
 does no one have vision 
you  go home and get lots of beauty sleep 
that s an order 
okay 
l was just checking for cold feet 
well  mine are toasty warm 
it s not too late to change your mind 
what  now you re having second thoughts 
you are 
no  i ve been waiting a century
to marry you  miss swan 
but 
l haven t told you everything about myself 
what  you re not a virgin 
look  you can t scare me away now 
look  a few years after carlisle created me 
l rebelled against him 
l resented him for curbing my appetite 
and so for a while  l went off on my own 
l wanted to know how it felt to hunt 
to taste human blood 
all the men i killed
were monsters 
and so was i 
edward  they were all murderers 
you probably saved more lives
than you took 
bella  that s what l told myself 
but they were all human beings 
l looked into their eyes as they died
and l saw who l was 
and what l was capable of 
and what i ll be capable of 
why are you telling me this tonight 
did you really think
this was gonna change my mind about you 
l just wondered
if it would change your mind about yourself 
and who you wanna see when
you look in the mirror a year from now 
l know l can do this 
let me tell you why 
because you did 
you should give yourself
some credit for that 
now  hopefully  a year from now 
i m gonna look in the mirror
and see someone like you 
l mean  someone capable of courage
and sacrifice and love 
  what is that 
  come on  let s go 
  i m late for my bachelor party 
send him out  bella 
or we re coming in after him 
so  this party 
will there be strippers 
no  just a couple of mountain lions 
maybe a few bears 
don t worry  bella 
we ll give him back in plenty of time 
okay  go  before they break my house 
let s go  let s go 
i ll meet you at the altar 
i ll be the one in white 
that was very convincing 
what did l say about beauty sleep 
sorry  bad dream 
lt was wedding jitters 
do you need some help 
l could do her hair 
really 
please 
i m not offended by your choice of groom 
just my blatant lack of respect for mortality 
essentially 
weddings  they bring everyone together

without some family drama 
  yeah

hello 
umm  i d like to propose a toast 
to my new sister 
bella  i hope you ve gotten enough sleep
these last 18 years 
 cause you won t be getting any more
for a while 
well  bella was just like everybody else 
totally mesmerized by edward 
or  the hair   as l call him 
and then  suddenly 
edward is all about bella 
even though she s not the captain
of the volleyball team 
i m just kidding  i m just kidding 
or the president of the student council 
edward will be a good husband 
i know this because i m a cop 
i know things 
like how to hunt somebody
to the ends of the earth 
now that you re my sister 
you ll have to get over
your aversion to fashion 
and i know how to use a gun 
skirts  heels  handbags 
go to sleep  my love
go to sleep
when you wake
you ll see me
i d like to thank renée and charlie
for bringing such a wonderful person
into the world and into our lives 
we will cherish and protect her forever 
it s an extraordinary thing
to meet someone
who you can bare your soul to 
and who will accept you for what you are 
i ve been waiting 
what seems like a very long time 
to get beyond what i am 
and with bella 
i feel like i can finally begin 
so i d like to propose a toast
to my beautiful bride 
no measure of time with you
will be long enough 
but let s start with forever

two left feet 
heartbeat 
 cause what

i m sorry 
i m just trying to appreciate
your last night as a human 
well  it s not my last night 
l thought you   
l didn t really wanna spend my honeymoon
writhing in pain

a real honeymoon with him  anyway

that s a sick joke 
you are joking

that s lsle esme 
lt was a gift from carlisle 
ls this totally necessary 
l am nothing if not traditional 
you wanna take a look around 
you tired 
do you wanna go for a swim 
yeah  that sounds nice 
l could use a few human minutes 
don t take too long  mrs  cullen 
okay 
okay 
she s a caged animal
london by night
crashing lights and cymbals
queens of twilight
and if i was you i d use the loo
before the long drive
we complement each other
just like satan and christ
baby  when i am laid to rest
may my laughter remain
like your kiss blew me away
answer your spirit
i gotta know right now
i see you before me
won t you show me how 
alice 
i wear my hair fizzy
i don t copy no style
but kissing and a scrubbing
it has consequences
you re on the bus again
past big ben
with your rip off oyster card
don t be a coward 
gotas mínimas
caudales de agua
you re so beautiful 
agua lisa
l promised that we d try 
if this doesn t work   
l trust you 
tu vida   
i ve waited a hundred years
but i d wait a million more
for you
nothing prepared me
for the privilege of being yours
it s okay 
if i had only felt the warmth
within your touch
if i had only seen
how you smile when you blush
or how you curl your lip
when you concentrate enough
i would have known what i was living for
what i ve been living for
your love is my turning page
only the sweetest words remain
every kiss is a cursive line
every touch is a redefining phrase
i surrender who i ve been for who you are
nothing makes me stronger
than your fragile heart
if i had only felt how it feels to be yours
i would have known
how badly are you hurt 
what 
no  bella  look 
bella  l can t tell you how sorry l am 
i m not 
really  i m not  i m fine 
don t say you re fine 
just don t 
no  you don t 
don t ruin this 
i ve already ruined it 
why can t you see
how perfectly happy l am 
or was five seconds ago 
l mean  now i m sort of pissed off  actually 
you should be angry with me 
l mean 
we knew this was gonna be tricky  right 
l think we did amazing 
l mean  it was amazing for me 
that s what you re worried about 
that l didn t enjoy myself 
l know it s not the same for you 
but for a human  l can t imagine
that it gets any better than that 
last night
was the best night of my existence 
you re the best 
you re not gonna touch me again  are you 
you know that s not what l mean 
let me make you breakfast 
dreamed last night about a time and place
where from our troubles we had escape
i held your hand and i felt complete
as you turned and said to me
from now on
from now on we ll be
you and me
we will be
from now on
from now on we ll be
you and me
you and me
we will be
only a dream
from now on
only a dream
from now on
only a dream
from now on
only a dream
from now on
you and me  we will be
l win 
bella 
you having a nightmare 
no 
lt was just a dream 
lt was a really good dream 
then why are you crying 
because l wanted it to be real 
tell me 
bella  l can t 
please 
maybe they ll say
she was in a car crash 
or tripped and fell off a cliff 
keep it in play  keep it in play 
come on 
come on  come on 
at least i ll get one thing out of it 
no  you won t 
cullens are not a danger
to the town or the tribe 
well  he s either gonna kill her
or change her 
 and the treaty says   
 l say  jacob 
l say 
you know  if you wanted things different 
you should ve become alpha 
turning it down seemed like a good idea
at the time 
jake  you really think you could kill bella
if she comes back a vampire 
no  make one of us do it 
then hold a grudge against us 
shut up  leah 
would you just get over it 
it s not like you ve imprinted on her 
at least they seem happy 
yeah  some people are just lucky  l guess 
lucky 
none of them
belong to themselves anymore 
and the sickest part is
their genes tell them they re happy about it 
least if you imprinted on someone 
you d finally forget about bella 
l mean  being any kind of happy is better
than being miserable
about someone you can t have 
bella  these are our housekeepers 
gustavo and kaure 
this is my wife bella 
excuse me 
well  l guess we just leave them to it 
what was that all about 
she s afraid for you 
why 
because l have you here all alone 
you mean she knows about you 
she suspects 
she s native ticuna  they have legends
about blood drinking demons
who prey on beautiful women 
hey 
you re late 
bella 
hey  don t come in here 
you don t need to see this 
 in sickness and health   remember 
lt must have been the chicken 
could you grab my bag 
what is it 
how many days has it been
since the wedding 
fourteen  why 
will you tell me what s going on 
i m late 
my period  it s late 
that s impossible 
can this happen 
  whoa 
  alice 
  bella 
are you all right 
i m not 100   sure 
why  what s wrong  i just   
you just what 
alice  what did you see 
  here s carlisle 
  bella  what s going on 
l don t know  i m a little worried 
can vampires go into shock 
has edward been harmed 
no 
l know that it s impossible 
but l think that i m pregnant 
whoa 
carlisle  l swear 
something just moved inside me 
 ls this even possible 
 i don t know 
what s he saying 
the sooner bella s here 
the sooner we can find out what it is 
i need you to get to the mainland at once 
yeah  yeah  l will 
well 
damn it 
kaure s making sure you re still alive 
slow we paddle through the lake
straight to the very center
of the darkest water
where we can embrace
the shadows on the surface
the eyes that look up lifeless
from our twins below
and though your arms and legs are under
love will be the echo in your ears
when all is lost and plundered
my love will be there still
true  it s chilling to behold
up close we stumble back   
what did you do with her 
what do you know about this 
l know that you are a demon 
you killed this little girl 
what 
her people have legends 
she might have seen this before 
please 
tell me how to help her 
you only do bad 
l am begging you 
l will do anything 
l love her 
please 
tell me how she can survive this 
death 
i m not gonna let it hurt you 
carlisle will get that thing out 
thing 
wait here while we load 
  hello 
  rosalie 
bella 
 what s going on 
 l need your help 
hey  son 
what s going on 
bella called him 
hey  haven t seen you in a while 
 you okay 
 so  you finally heard from bella 
they re extending their trip 
seems she caught a bug 
they wanna wait until she feels better
before they travel 
she s sick 
yeah  she told me not to worry 
but she sounded 
l don t know  off 
she ll be okay  charlie 
come on  let s eat 
jacob  let it go 
ls it true 
hello  jacob  how are you 
listen  just give it to me straight 
jake  is that you 
 she s here 
 they came home two weeks ago 
jake 
i m glad you came 
 close enough 
 what s your problem 
rose  it s okay 
you look terrible 
yeah  it s nice to see you  too 
so  are you gonna tell me
what s wrong with you 
rose  you wanna help me up 
you did this 
we didn t know it was even possible 
  what is it 
  i m not sure 
ultrasounds and needles
won t penetrate the embryonic sac 
l can t see it  either 
and l can t see bella s future anymore 
we ve been researching legends 
but there isn t much to go on 
what we do know is that it s strong 
and fast growing 
why haven t you done anything 
take it out of her 
this is none of your business  dog 
rose 
all this fighting isn t good for bella 
the fetus isn t good for bella 
say the word  alice   baby  
it s just a little baby 
possibly 
carlisle  you ve gotta do something 
no 
it s not his decision  it s not any of yours 
jacob  l need to talk to you 
l always knew you d destroy her 
she thinks carlisle can turn her
at the last minute 
like he did for me and esme 
 can he 
 probability is slight 
and if her heart fails   
look  jacob 
l need you to do something for me 
for her 
you have a connection with her
that i ll never understand 
maybe you could talk to her 
change her mind 
you can keep her alive 
and if l can t 
if she dies 
you get what you always wanted 
to kill me 
rose  i m fine  really 
 so  edward sent you in here to talk to me 
 sort of 
though l can t figure out
why he thinks you d listen to me 
l mean  you never have before 
since when are you and blondie bffs 
rose understands what l want 
what are you thinking  bella 
seriously 
l know this seems like a scary thing 
but it s not 
it s like this miracle or something 
l can feel him 
so  it s a bouncing baby boy 
i m sorry l didn t know 
should ve brought some blue balloons 
it s just a guess 
when l picture him  l see a boy 
we ll see 
you won t 
jake  l can do this 
 i m strong enough 
 come on 
you can spout that crap to your
bloodsucker  but you don t fool me 
l can see what that thing s doing to you 
it s a killer  bella 
 you re wrong 
 and when you die 
what was the point 
of me loving you  you loving him 
how is that right for anyone 
because l sure don t see it 
listen to me  bella 
please 
just don t do this 
live  okay 
please 
jake  everything s gonna be okay 
jacob  don t go 
l know how this ends 
and i m not sticking around to watch 
jacob 
jake  i can do this  i can do this 
don t do this 
i m strong enough 
i m strong enough 
this is none
of your business  dog 
jacob  don t go 
you did this 
everything s gonna be okay 
the fetus isn t good for bella 
i know how this ends 
don t you even care that it s killing you 
jake  jake  jake 
jake  jake  jake 
  is it true  jacob 
  what will it be 
it s growing fast 
  it s unnatural 
  dangerous 
  monstrosity 
  an abomination 
on our land 
  we can t allow it 
  we can t allow it 
  we can t allow it 
  we can t allow it 
we have to protect the tribe 
what they ve bred
won t be able to control its thirst 
every human will be in danger 
  we re ready 
  no time to waste 
now 
we must destroy it before it s born 
you mean  kill bella 
her choice affects us all 
bella s human 
our protection applies to her 
she s dying anyway 
we have real enemies to fight tonight 
tonight 
you will fight with us  jake 
l will not 
i am the grandson of ephraim black 
i am the grandson of a chief 
i wasn t born to follow you  or anyone else 
whoa 
don t worry  they re not following us 
what do you think you re doing here 
 l left sam s pack 
 go home  seth 
 l won t stand behind him 
 oh  yes  you will 
i m not kidding  get out of here 
ls that an order 
gonna make me bow down  too 
i m not ordering anyone 
look  i m just going off
on my own here  okay 
great  and i ve got your back 
no  you don t 
if sam comes after bella 
are you really ready
to fight your own brothers 
your sister 
if it s the right thing to do 
whatever 
i m gonna go give the cullens a heads up 
do what you want 
how cool is this  two man pack 
two against the world 
you re getting on my nerves  seth 
i ll shut up  can do 
get ready 
they re coming for bella 
they re not gonna touch her 
agreed 
man  l can smell them
from all the way out here 
what the hell are you doing here 
i m not gonna let my little brother
get himself killed 
go away  leah  l can take care of myself 
that you think so
proves you need a babysitter 
okay  would the both of you shut up 
did sam send you 
sam doesn t even know l left 
l think he just figured it out 
jake 
l know what his plan is 
sam s lost the element of surprise 
and he doesn t want
to take you on outnumbered 
so he s not gonna come at you head on 
he s got the place surrounded
and he ll wait for his opportunity 
we won t get through without a fight 
no fights 
we won t be the ones to break the treaty 
the treaty is void  at least in sam s mind 
not in ours 
carlisle  no one s hunted for weeks 
we ll make do 
you ve done us a great service  jacob 
thank you 
l know they re out there somewhere 
but l can t hear them anymore 
it s so quiet 
l stopped hearing them  too 
the second l decided to leave 
it s nice 
you know you can t stay here 
 but l don t have any place   
 l can t trust you with the cullens 
you hate them too much 
you don t even like me 
l don t have to 
l just have to follow you 
look  seth doesn t want you here 
neither do l 
being unwanted isn t exactly
a new thing for me 
look  i ll stay out of your way 
i ll do whatever you want 
except go back to sam s pack and be the
pathetic ex girlfriend he can t get away from 
you don t know how many times
l wished l could imprint on someone 
anyone 
just to break the connection 
all right 
i m gonna do a perimeter run 
you got my flank 
god and his priests and his kings
all will wait
as they go on
mmm mmm
held between heaven and hell
as they re dancing
as they don t
cold
your rib is cracked 
but there are no splinters 
you haven t punctured anything 
 yet 
 edward 
it s breaking her bones now 
it s crushing you from the inside out 
carlisle  tell her what you told me  tell her 
carlisle  tell me  it s all right 
the fetus isn t compatible with your body 
it s too strong 
lt won t allow you to get
the nutrition you need 
it s starving you by the hour 
l can t stop it  and l can t slow it down 
at this rate  your heart will give out
before you can deliver 
then i ll hold on as long as l can  and then   
bella 
there are some conditions
that even venom can t overcome 
you understand 
i m sorry 
edward  i m sorry 
l can t live without you 
you won t  you re gonna have a part of me 
he ll need you 
do you honestly think that l could love it
or even tolerate it if it killed you 
it s not his fault 
you have to accept what is 
because you ve given me no choice 
bella  we re supposed to be partners 
remember 
but you decided this on your own 
you ve decided to leave me 
don t see it that way 
well  l have no other way to see it 
 cause it s me who ll lose you 
and l don t choose that 
l don t choose that 
cold
sing for the lion and lamb
yours completely
yours
as we go over
sing for the lion and lamb
washington driving in the red zone 
almost stripped of the ball 
he stood up and calvin finally   
are you cold 
l got it 
don t do that 
what 
smile like i m your favorite person
in the world 
you re one of them 
feels complete when you re here  jake 
we need to find a way
to get some food into her system 
 if l could only see the fetus   
 the baby 
   maybe l could figure out what it wants 
think you might be right 
jacob just had an idea 
lt wasn t an idea  lt was a snide comment 
what were you thinking 
that it s probably just looking for someone
to sink its teeth into 
he s thirsty 
l know the feeling 
if it s craving 
it s not gonna want animal blood 
l have some o negative laid aside for bella 
walk with me 
wait  wait  wait 
you re gonna make her drink that 
it s the fastest way to test the theory 
only if you re comfortable with it 
i ll try anything 
just hold on 
l think i m gonna be sick 
this might make it a little easier to take 
tastes
good 
mmm 
your pulse is already getting stronger 
it s working 
  well  you sound better 
l am 
l feel much better 
this whole thing must ve put a kink

which certainly fits the situation

 i m sorry  billy 
l just thought you should know 
bella s dead 
lt killed her 
let s go 
it s like gravity 
your whole center shifts 
suddenly  it s not the earth
holding you here 
you would do anything 
be anything she needs 
a friend  a brother 
a protector 
alice  jasper 
you re gonna be all right 
 we re outnumbered 
 by a lot 
l won t let them hurt my family 
stop  it s over 
if you kill her  you kill me 
jacob imprinted 
they can t hurt her 
whoever a wolf imprints on can t be harmed 
it s their most absolute law 
she shouldn t be this still 
it s the morphine 
  maybe l was too late 
  no  edward 
listen to her heart 
sitting pretty uptightly
the knots keep you at my side
upstairs  in corners
eyes blink for the crawl
up and out
my beacon will choke
if yours is taken
i dare four more lines
four more lines
sellotape an end to
sellotape an end
hover thought
mosquito
bite down
my fickle hands machine
surprises
sellotape an end to a story that is hanging
over silence always wasted
swells with every teardrop
pulls my threads to kid gloves
sellotape an end to this
now i m the guilty one
hey 
give me my sentence
i ll pay my penance
let me kill them all
and the pain i have for hurting you
i didn t mean it
ah  it s from carlisle 
which is spelt with an  s   sweet bianca 
he s added a new member to his coven 
ah 
increasing his power 
first it s the spelling 
then the grammar 
at least our dispute with the cullens is over 
 over 
 mmm 
goodness  no 
our dispute goes far beyond
the fate of a mere human 
and what might it be 
why  brother  l thought you understood 
they have something l want 
if you ever leave me  baby
leave some morphine at my door
 cause it would take
a whole lot of medication
to realize what we used to have 
we don t have it anymore
there s no religion that could save me
no matter how long
my knees are on the floor
so keep in mind all the sacrifices i m making
will keep you by my side
will keep you from walking out the door
 cause there ll be no sunlight
if i lose you  baby
there ll be no clear skies
if i lose you  baby
just like the clouds 
my eyes will do the same
if you walk away
every day it will rain  rain  rain
i ll never be your mother s favorite
your daddy can t even look me in the eye
if i was in their shoes 
i d be doing the same thing
saying there goes my little girl
walking with that troublesome guy
but they re just afraid
of something they can t understand
but little darling 
watch me change their minds
yeah  for you i ll try  i ll try  i ll try  i ll try
i ll pick up these broken pieces
till i m bleeding
if that ll make you mine
 cause there ll be no sunlight
if i lose you  baby
there ll be no clear skies
if i lose you  baby
just like the clouds 
my eyes will do the same
if you walk away
every day it will rain  rain  rain
don t just say goodbye
i ll pick up these broken pieces
till i m bleeding
if that ll make it right
 cause there ll be no sunlight
if i lose you  baby
there ll be no clear skies
if i lose you  baby
just like the clouds 
my eyes will do the same
if you walk away
every day it will rain  rain  rain
heart beats fast
colors and promises
how to be brave
how can i love when i m afraid
to fall
but watching you stand alone
all of my doubt
suddenly goes away somehow
one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling  don t be afraid
i have loved you
for a thousand years
i ll love you for a thousand more
time stands still
beauty in all she is
i will be brave
i will not let anything take away
what s standing in front of me
every breath
every hour has come to this
one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling  don t be afraid
i have loved you
for a thousand years
i ll love you for a thousand more
and all along i believed i would find you
time has brought your heart to me
i have loved you
for a thousand years
i ll love you for a thousand more
one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling  don t be afraid
i have loved you
for a thousand years
i ll love you for a thousand more
