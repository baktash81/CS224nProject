 growling 
he honestly doesn t seem to like you  finstock 
he loves me  do you know why 
he loves me  because i m his master 
he knows i will protect him 
like the students here
at hamilton university  sit 
they know why i m here 
finstock  do you know why you re here 
yes  sir  32 500 a year and summers off 
you re here because it s time to bring
the glory back to this institution 
the regional boxing finals
are in three months 
now  you and i have a sacred oath
to provide these young people
with an opportunity
to develop not only their minds 
but their spirit as well 
their fighting spirit  am i right 
i promised the alumni
a winning boxing team
and all you ve given me is this todd howard 
all he ever did on the field
was play in the school band 
clarinet  looks like 
can i make a sudden move 
that s the kid  his cousin scott played
basketball for me at beacontown high 
  and 
  and what 
 and what  and what   what  
i don t think scott knew the first thing
about playing the clarinet 
i gave that kid a full scholarship
based on your recommendation 
on my recommendation  that s great 
  finstock 
  what 
your job is riding on this boxing team 
and so is my reputation as an educator 
and all you brought me is a clarinet player 
   girl  i think it s that way 
  ok  three blocks 
 horn honking 
 man  todd  todd 
  thanks a lot 
  bye

and left after the administration building 
   todd  or was it right 
  we ll just keep going straight 
i know how you feel 
college is a stressful time 
especially on your first day 
i mean  it s stressful for anyone 
even for people without your particular worry 
  what worry 
  you know 
 girl  i don t believe it 
 girl  wow

i hate it when you do that 
i m not ashamed of what i am

i m here at a new school 
i gotta make new friends and try
to fit in without this hanging over me 
it is true that sometimes it skips family members 
your mother and father aren t werewolves 
but if i were you 
i d keep my possibilities open

i have a favor to ask you 
i wanna be a veterinarian

  i need to speak to a coach 
  you re todd howard 
  yeah 
  we re all depending on you 
  depending on me for what 
  hey  you missed a spot 
i had a kid once who had
an athletic scholarship just like you 
a gifted athlete 
but he had this crazy dream
about wanting to become a chiropractor 
but he had to work all night at this diner 
because he was supporting his sister
and she had three kids 
  and his name was philip  no wait 
  doesn t matter 
it sorta does  his name was george 
her three kids were really nice 
but one had two thumbs on his right hand 
so did he become a chiropractor 
not with two thumbs
on his right hand  he didn t 
wait a minute 
you re from beacontown  aren t you 
yeah 
now i get it  you think that i m   
you can forget it  i m not scott 
i can t do what scott did 
what s a five letter word
for  italian sausage  
so that s why they gave me
a sports scholarship 
so what  go a few rounds in the ring 
get your head knocked off  maybe 
you get your scholarship
and everybody s happy 
  jump into what ring 
  just show up for practice this thursday 
  practice for what 
  boxing

would you take it easy

you ll notice i m not laughing 
 xylophone music 
 coughing 
  i had dibs on this 
  possession is nine tenths of the law 
so now you re a lawyer

  over my head 
  over any jock s head 
jock

but i m here on a sports scholarship
with a coach who wants me
to have two right thumbs 
my roommate sunbathes with a light bulb

i ll do the rest 
wonderful  wonderful 
she called me a dog 
 man  the bed they laid him in
was only six feet long 
his feet hung over the end 
mary  his wife  clung to his side 
her tears mingled with his blood 
her prayers echoed the grief
of an entire nation 
the small projectile from the derringer
that john wilkes booth used
  was lodged in his left temple 
  i ve got fleas  you distract him 
and all night long the vigil waited
in that small boarding house
across from ford s theatre
until the wee hours in the morning 
when fate dealt that final blow   
   a crowd of mourners gathered 
white  black  rich and poor 
and so  ten hours after that fatal shot 
president abraham lincoln   
mr  howard  where are you going  mr  howard

of dressing up in a dog costume
  and trying to frighten our alumni 
  but dean dunn   
don t give me any of that backtalk 
if you re trying to push me   
   you have no idea who you re dealing with

i wanna talk to you 
 croaking in background 
i ve been talking with your other professors 
i know about the car  your grades
and how you re coasting through 
when you have a gift 
you have a responsibility to use it wisely 
you re not  and you re
only letting yourself down 
  are you in a hurry 
  actually  i have to get to practice 
team s nothing without the wolf 
you can t expect the wolf
to solve all your problems 
you do realize
you have finals coming up  don t you 
  yeah  regional finals 
  no  course finals 
listen  i don t think i need this class 
you told me to choose the right path 
and with the road that i ve chosen   
   i don t think i need biology at all 
i m very sorry to hear that 
you waited for me 
i don t know why 
i never thought i d say it 
but i miss the old todd 
what happened 
  he turned into a werewolf 
  but that s not the real you 
the wolf lets me do what i wanna do  it s a gift 
  i have a responsibility to myself   
  responsibility 
what about school  or being a veterinarian 
what about you and me 
my feelings for you are real 
they have nothing to do with the wolf 
those others could care less about the real you 
look  i m late and you re wrong 
that s the way it s done  girls 
 children laughing in background 
watch this 
we ll play through 
how can you take him seriously 
he s a freshman 
with an awful lot of hair 
why don t you shut your mouth 
   todd  let s settle this man to man 
  i don t fight chipmunks 
not here  gus 
what are you doing 
where are you going 
you die in the ring  pal 
fore 
it s in the hole 
you guys studying 
yes  some of us
actually have to take finals 
mr  stilinsky   
   what say you  me and the wolf
take the wheels for a little   
 imitates car sounds 
   spin 
  nope 
   todd  huh  huh 
how about you  big guy 
i might even let you drive 
what do you say 
i m busy  ok 
  see you  stiles 
  see you  chub 
  check 46 
  you know what s funny 
i wanted you to become the wolf
more than anybody else 
so i guess i m partly to blame
for what you ve become 
what have i become 
  a jerk  todd 
  aw   
 sighs 
thank you for coming  i   
i really need to talk to you 
  you re in a tough spot  huh 
  yeah 
i just let it get out of hand 
i mean  i know you    you warned me 
and i guess i should ve listened  because   
   i got a little crazy  uncle harold 
and i ended up hurting
a lot of people that i really care about 
what are you gonna do about it 
i don t know 
i really don t know 
well  don t be too tough on yourself 
after all  you re only human too 
so 
so you made a mistake 
you admitted it  it s over 
maybe it s time you were todd howard again 
i m scared 
really scared 
if i m myself in this ring tomorrow 
i could get killed 
i don t think you re gonna get killed 
this guy s really big  he s huge 
never mind him 
 cause what i m interested in is you
and what you ve got right there 
what does that matter
when the guy is twice your size 
  well   
  i wouldn t stand a chance 
maybe not 
but sometimes you have to make
a stand  even if you don t want to 
  what s that 
  boxing gloves  they used to belong to me 
  in college i used to box  too 
  really 
yeah  i can show you some moves
nobody s seen in 30 years 
  now when s this big match 
  tomorrow 
plenty of time 
  what are you doing 
  studying 
i still have two more finals 
i guess you wouldn t know about that 
nicki   
   i m real sorry 
for everything 
  i guess the wolf makes you a jerk 
  no  i m a jerk 
i just hope that there s still time
to make up for it all 
  there s still time to try 
  i wanna try 
you can start by saying you re really sorry
for mistreating someone you like 
i m sorry for mistreating someone   
   i really love 
  you missed your final 
  what 
your final 
i m sure professor brooks flunked you 
oh  yeah 
  maybe we could talk to her 
  yeah 
  professor brooks  hi 
  hi 
we were just coming to see you 
listen  i know
i probably don t deserve it  but   
   if you would give me a second chance 
i d really like to earn my grade 
you can take a make up exam
tomorrow at noon at the latest 
i have to turn the grades in
by the end of the day 
  i have a fight at three 
  the test takes three hours 
  take it or leave it
