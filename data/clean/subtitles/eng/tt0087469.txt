was the stone very smooth
like a rock from a sacred river
yes
with three lines across it
representing the three levels
of the universe
thats right
yes
ive seen stones
like the one you lost
but why would maharaja
take the sacred stone from here
they says we must pray
to their evil god
we says we will not
excuse me
i dont understand how one rock
could destroy a whole village
hes saying when
the sacred stone was taken
the village wells dried up
and the river turned to sand
the crops were swallowed
by the earth
and the animals laid down
and turned to dust
then one night there
was a fire in the fields
the men went out
to fight the fire
when they came back the women
were crying in the darkness
children

were on our way to delhi
this is miss scott
this is mr round
short round
my name is indiana jones
dr jones the eminent
archaeologist
hard to believe isnt it
ah
i remember first
hearing your name
when i was up at oxford
oh
im chattar lal prime minister
to his highness
the maharaja of pankot
im enchanted
enchanted
thank you very much
thank you very much
welcome to pankot palace
enchanted huh
shorty wheres my razor
we are fortunate tonight
to have so many
unexpected visitors
this is captain
blumburtt
11th poona rifles
and you sir are
dr jones i presume
i am captain
captain blumburtt and his troops
are on a routine
inspection tour
the british find it amusing
to inspect us
at their convenience
i do hope sir
that its not uh
inconvenient to you uh sir
the british worry so
about their empire
makes us all feel like
wellcaredfor children
ah
you look beautiful
i think the maharaja
is swimming in loot
maybe it wasnt such a bad
idea coming here after all
you look like a princess
mr lal what do they call
the maharajas wife
his highness
has not yet taken a wife
how interesting
well uh maybe its because
he hasnt found the right woman
his supreme highness
guardian of pankot tradition
the maharaja of pankot
zalim singh
thats the maharaja
a kid
maybe he like older women
captain blumburtt
was just telling me
something of the interesting
history of the palace
the importance it played
in the mutiny
it seems the british never
forget the mutiny of 1857
yes well you know i think
there are other events
before the mutiny
going back a century
back to the time of clive
that are more interesting
and what events are those
dr jones
well if memory
serves me correctly
this area this province
was the center of activity
for the thuggee
ah
snake surprise
whats the surprise
dr jones
you know perfectly well
the thuggee cult has been dead
for nearly a century
yes of course
the thuggee was an obscenity
that worshipped kali
with human sacrifices
the british army
nicely did away with them
well i suppose stories
of the thuggee die hard
there are no stories anymore
im not so sure
we came from a small village
the peasants there told us
pankot palace
was growing powerful again
because of some ancient evil
village stories dr jones
theyre just fear and folklore
youre beginning to worry
captain blumburtt
im not worried
mr prime minister just uh
just um interested
ah
what you are not eating
i had bugs for lunch
give me your hat
why
cause im gonna
puke in it oh
you know
the villagers also told us
pankot palace
had taken something
dr jones in our country
its not usual for a guest
to insult his host
im sorry
i thought we were talking
about folklore
excuse me sir do you have
anything simple like soup
what exactly was it
they say was stolen
a sacred rock
ha
you see captain a rock
ah
ah
something connected
the villagers rock
and the old legend
of the sankara stones
dr jones we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors
i seem to remember
that in honduras
you were accused
of being a grave robber
rather than an archaeologist
well the newspapers greatly
exaggerated the incident
and wasnt it
the sultan of madagascar
who threatened
to cut your head off
if you ever returned
to his country
no it wasnt my head
then your hands perhaps
no it wasnt my hands
it was my
my misunderstanding
exactly what we have
here dr jones
i have heard the evil stories
of the thuggee cult
i thought the stories were told
to frighten children
later i learnt
the thuggee cult was once real
and did of unspeakable things
i am ashamed of what happened
here so many years ago
and i assure you
this will never happen again
in my kingdom
if i offended you
then i am sorry
ah dessert
chilled monkey brains
uh i think ill
just check on willie
thats all you better do
tell me later what happened

my palace slave

that shock you
nothing shocks me

do a lot of research
always
and what sort of research
would you do on me
nocturnal activities
you mean like what sort of cream
i put on my face at night
what position

mating customs
love rituals
primitive sexual practices
so youre an authority
in that area
years of fieldwork
