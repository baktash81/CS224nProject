a new maharaja 
and again the palace
has the power of the dark light 
it is that place
kill my people

you listen to suwamu 
you leave lanka 
shh   
they came from palace   
and took sivalinga   
from our village 
took what 
it s a stone   
a sacred stone from the shrine
that protects the village 
it is why siva brought you here 
we weren t brought here 
our plane crashed

to help us find the stone 
it was siva
who made you fall

dr  jones  did they
make the plane crash
to get you here 
no  shorty 
it s just a ghost story 
don t worry about it 
they took the stone from here 
was the stone very smooth
like a rock from a sacred river 
yes 
with three lines across it
representing the three levels
of the universe 
that s right 
yes 
i ve seen stones
like the one you lost 
but why would maharaja
take the sacred stone from here 
they says we must pray
to their evil god 
we says we will not 
excuse me 
i don t understand how one rock
could destroy a whole village 
he s saying when
the sacred stone was taken 
the village wells dried up 
and the river turned to sand 
the crops were swallowed
by the earth 
and the animals laid down
and turned to dust 
then one night there
was a fire in the fields 
the men went out
to fight the fire 
when they came back  the women
were crying in the darkness 
children 
he says
they stole their children 
sankara  sankara   
ranjit 
ranjit 
sankara 
little boy escaped
from the evil palace

but then i cannot imagine
where in the world the three
of you would look at home 
we re not lost 
we re on our way to delhi 
this is miss scott 
this is mr  round 
short round 
my name is indiana jones 
dr  jones  the eminent
archaeologist 
hard to believe  isn t it 
ah 
i remember first
hearing your name
when i was up at oxford 
oh 
i m chattar lal  prime minister
to his highness 
the maharaja of pankot 
i m enchanted 
enchanted 
thank you very much 
thank you very much 
welcome to pankot palace 
enchanted  huh 
shorty  where s my razor 
we are fortunate tonight
to have so many
unexpected visitors 
this is captain   
   blumburtt 
11th poona rifles 
and you  sir  are
dr  jones  i presume 
i am  captain 
captain blumburtt and his troops
are on a routine
inspection tour 
the british find it amusing
to inspect us
at their convenience 
i do hope  sir 
that it s not  uh 
inconvenient to you  uh    sir 
the british worry so
about their empire 
makes us all feel like
well cared for children 
ah   
you look beautiful 
i think the maharaja
is swimming in loot 
maybe it wasn t such a bad
idea coming here after all 
you look like a princess 
mr  lal  what do they call
the maharaja s wife 
his highness
has not yet taken a wife 
how interesting 
well  uh  maybe it s because
he hasn t found the right woman 
his supreme highness 
guardian of pankot tradition 
the maharaja of pankot 
zalim singh 
that s the maharaja 
a kid  
maybe he like older women 
captain blumburtt
was just telling me
something of the interesting
history of the palace   
the importance it played
in the mutiny 
it seems the british never
forget the mutiny of 1857 
yes  well  you know  i think
there are other events   
before the mutiny 
going back a century 
back to the time of clive   
that are more interesting 
and what events are those 
dr  jones 
well  if memory
serves me correctly 
this area  this province 
was the center of activity
for the thuggee 
ah 
snake    surprise 
what s the surprise 
dr  jones 
you know perfectly well
the thuggee cult has been dead
for nearly a century 
yes  of course 
the thuggee was an obscenity
that worshipped kali
with human sacrifices 
the british army
nicely did away with them 
well  i suppose stories
of the thuggee die hard 
there are no stories anymore 
i m not so sure 
we came from a small village 
the peasants there told us
pankot palace
was growing powerful again
because of some ancient evil 
village stories  dr  jones 
they re just fear and folklore 
you re beginning to worry
captain blumburtt 
i m not worried 
mr  prime minister  just  uh   
just  um  interested 
ah   
what  you are not eating 
i had bugs for lunch 
give me your hat 
why 
 cause i m gonna
puke in it  oh 
you know 
the villagers also told us
pankot palace
had taken something 
dr  jones  in our country 
it s not usual for a guest
to insult his host 
i m sorry 
i thought we were talking
about folklore 
excuse me  sir  do you have
anything simple  like soup 
what exactly was it
they say was stolen 
a sacred rock 
ha 
you see  captain  a rock 
ah 
ah   
something connected   
the villagers  rock
and the old legend
of the sankara stones 
dr  jones  we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors 
i seem to remember
that in honduras
you were accused
of being a grave robber
rather than an archaeologist 
well  the newspapers greatly
exaggerated the incident 
and wasn t it
the sultan of madagascar
who threatened
to cut your head off
if you ever returned
to his country 
no  it wasn t my head 
then your hands  perhaps 
no  it wasn t my hands 
it was my   
my misunderstanding 
exactly what we have
here  dr  jones 
i have heard the evil stories
of the thuggee cult 
i thought the stories were told
to frighten children 
later  i learnt
the thuggee cult was once real
and did of unspeakable things 
i am ashamed of what happened
here so many years ago 
and i assure you
this will never happen again
in my kingdom 
if i offended you   
then i am sorry 
ah  dessert 
chilled monkey brains 
uh  i think i ll
just check on willie 
that s all you better do 
tell me later what happened 
am scray 
ah 
i ve got something for you 
there s nothing you have
that i could possibly want 
right 
oh 
mmm  mmm  mmm 
mmm 
oh  you re a very nice man 
maybe you could be
my palace slave 
wear your jewels to bed 
princess 
yeah 
and nothing else 
that shock you 
nothing shocks me 
i m a scientist 
so  as a scientist  you
do a lot of research 
always 
and what sort of research
would you do on me 
nocturnal activities 
you mean like what sort of cream
i put on my face at night 
what position
i like to sleep in 
mating customs 
love rituals 
primitive sexual practices 
so you re an authority
in that area 
years of fieldwork 
oh 
i don t blame you
for being sore at me 
i can be hard to handle 
i ve had worse 
but you ll never have better 
i don t know

to prejudice my experiment

trouble with you is  willie

five minutes 
you ll be back over here
in five minutes 
i ll be asleep in five minutes
