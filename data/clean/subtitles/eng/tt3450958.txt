there was madness in his eyes
he said they would use us

theyve been forcing us to work

what kind of work
wait my little son is here
grant

and the end
we havent had food or
water since we got here
why do they need a wall
donkey

bad place
bad bad place
what you see
must save them but how
must think what would caesar do
no
why so small
what did the colonel promised you
you really think he let you live
after we are gone
you let them call you donkey
you are ape
colonel wants see you
history
interfere with the work again i will
begin slaughtering the apes one by one
understand
i need that wall
apes need food and water theyll get
food and water when they finish their work
give apes food and water
or they cannot finish it
you know youre very emotional
what makes you think youre
in a position to make demands
okay lets go
the soldiers who are coming here
they are not coming
to join you are they
i saw men outside on the wall
preparing for battle
they told me youre smart
but thats impressive
no they wont be joining me
they are against you
they fear me
why
because you kill your own men
we found bodies
something wrong with these men
jesus christ you are impressive
you paint quite a picture
what you must think of me
i think you have no mercy
you came here to kill me
were you going to show me mercy
i showed you mercy
when i spared your men
i offered you peace
and you killed my family
mercy
do you have any idea what
your mercy would do to us
youre much stronger than we are
youre smart as hell
no matter what you say youd eventually
replace us thats the law of nature
the irony is we created you
we tried to defy nature bend it to our will
and natures been punishing us
for our arrogance ever since
ten months ago i sent out
recon units to look for your base
my own son was a soldier
with one of the units
one day he suddenly stopped speaking
he became primitive like an animal
they contacted me said that
they thought hed lost his mind
that the war was too much for him
then the man who cared for
him stopped speaking too
their medic had a theory
before he stopped speaking
that the virus that
almost wiped us out
the virus that every human
survivor still carries
had suddenly changed
mutated
and if it spread it would destroy
humanity for good this time
not by killing us but by robbing
us of the things that make us human
our speech our higher thinking
it would turn us into
beasts you talk about mercy
what would you have done
it was a moment of clarity for me
i realized that i would have
to sacrifice my only son
so that humanity could be saved
i held that gun in my
hand for a long time
and i pointed it at my only child
he looked at me with
trust in his eyes
even in his primitive gaze
i felt his
love
i pulled the trigger
it purified me
it made my purpose clear
i gave orders to kill the
others infected all of them
burn their belongings anything
that might spread contamination
some of the men
questioned my judgment
i was asking them to
do what i had done
to sacrifice their friends their family
of course they refused
i had them killed too
others with children
deserted into the woods
one of those cowards fled
to my superiors up north
they tried to convince me that this
plague could be dealt with medically
thats when i realized that they
had learned nothing from our past
you killed them too
what did i do preacher
you severed their heads sir
except for the one i spared
so he could return
and deliver a message
if they wanted to
relieve me of my command
theyd have to meet me
here and do it themselves
this used to be a weapons depot
they turned it into a relocation camp
when the crisis was just beginning
but the weapons are all still
here inside the mountain
how many men will be coming
probably all of them
but dont get any ideas
the only thing they fear
more than me is you apes
this is a holy war
all of human history
has led to this moment
if we lose well be
the last of our kind
it will be a planet of apes
and well become your cattle
look at you
you think i am sick dont you
i didnt mean to kill your son
but if his destiny was to
inherit your unholy kingdom
i am glad i did
get back
so emotional
i see how conflicted you are
you are confused in your purpose
youre angry at me for something
i did that was an act of war
but youre taking this
all much far too personally
what do you think my men
would have done to your apes
if you had killed me
or is killing me more important
soldiers everywhere
how will we get in
must get in somehow
