frank  he just laughs 
  so how s the drumming going  andy 
yeah  it s going really well 
i m the new core drummer  so  
all  hey 
emma  congratulations 
frank 
tom brady 
  did you hear  jim 
  no  what 
  trav got named this year s mvp 
  that s fantastic  travis 
emma  yeah  and dustin
is heading up model un 
soon to be rhodes scholar
and who knows what else 
and jim  teacher of the year 
  well  hey  listen  
emma  i mean  come on 
the talent at this table 
that is stunning 
  and andy  with your drumming 
  it s going okay  andy 
yeah  it s going really 
really well  actually 
i m part of shaffer s
top jazz orchestra 
which means
it s the best in the country 
and i m a core member
so i ll start playing
in competitions  i just  
i found out i m
the youngest person in the band 
how do you know who wins in
a music competition  isn t it subjective 
  no 
  does the studio get you a job 
it s not an actual studio 
it s the name of the ensemble 
but it s a big step forward in my career 
i m so glad you figured it out 
it s a nasty business  i am sure 
hey  are you gonna tell them
about your game this week  
  living up to your title 
travis  i scored a 93 yard touchdown 
frank 
school record  school record 
  is that true  that s fantastic 
  it s division three 
it s carlton football  it s not even
division two  it s division three 
  you got any friends  andy 
  no 
  oh  why is that 
  i don t know  i never saw the use 
who are you
gonna play with otherwise 
lennon and mccartney they
were school buddies  am i right 
charlie parker didn t know anybody
till jo jones threw a cymbal at his head 
that s your idea of success 
being the greatest musician of the 20th
century is anybody s idea of success 
dying broke and drunk
and full of heroin
at the age of 34
is not my idea of success 
i d rather die drunk  broke at 34
and have people talk about me 
than live to be rich and sober at 90
and nobody remember who i was 
but your friends will remember you 
that s the point 
none of us were friends
with charlie parker  that s the point 
travis and dustin  they have plenty
of friends and plenty of purpose 
they ll make great
school board presidents 
oh  that s what this is all about 
you think you re better than us 
  catch on quick  are you in model un 
  i got a reply for you 
you think carlton football is a joke 
come play with us 
four words you will never hear
from the nfl 
  who wants dessert 
  heard from lincoln center 
 band playing jazz music

  i can play it  okay 
i said not now 
if you want the fucking part  earn it 
andrew 
i m just gonna lay it out there 
this is why i don t think
we should be together 
and i ve thought about it a lot 
and this is what s gonna happen 
i m gonna keep pursuing
what i m pursuing 
because i m doing that 
it s gonna take up my time 
i m not gonna be able
to spend time with you 
even when i do  i m gonna
be thinking about drumming 
about jazz  my charts  because of that 
you re gonna start to resent me 
you re gonna tell me to ease up on
the drumming  spend more time with you 
i m not gonna be able to do that  i ll start
to resent you for even asking me to stop 
we re just gonna start to hate
each other  it s gonna be ugly 
and so for those reasons 
i d rather just  you know 
break it off clean 
because i wanna be great 
and you re not 
i wanna be one of the greats 
and i would stop you
from doing that 
yeah 
you know i would stop you
from doing that 
you know that for a fact 
yes 
and i d barely see you anyway 
  yeah 
  when i see you  you d treat me like shit
because i m some girl
who doesn t know what she wants 
you have a path  you re going
to be great  i m gonna be forgotten 
and you won t be able
to give me the time of day
because you have
bigger things to pursue 
that s exactly my point 
what the fuck is wrong with you 
you re right 
we should not be dating 
i m okay  thanks 
fuck  fuck 
fucking piece of shit 
fuck you 
fuck 
fucking piece of shit  come on

 jazz music
playing over speakers 
just listen for a minute 
six years ago   
i came across a kid in a
practice room working on his scales 
he was early second year and he d
started at shaffer with a lot of hope 
like all you guys 
but the truth was that he barely
squeaked in to begin with   
and he was really struggling 
the faculty were all telling him 
 maybe this isn t for you  
but they didn t see what i saw 
this scared  skinny kid
cursing himself because
he couldn t get his scales right 
i saw a drive in him 
and i put him in studio band 
and when he graduated 
marsalis made him third trumpet
at lincoln center 
a year later  he was first 
that s who you re listening to now

 door opens then closes 
when did you start
talking to her 
your father got in contact
this week 
does the name sean casey
mean anything to you 
you know of his death 
last month  he hanged himself
in his apartment 
what does that have to do
with me 
he suffered
from anxiety and depression 
his mother claims this started
during his time as fletcher s student 
now  the caseys aren t wealthy 
they don t wanna file suit 
so  what do they want 
to make sure terence fletcher is never
allowed to do this to another student 
andrew  on screen  
hey  dad  look at my paradiddle 
jim 
yeah  that s my boy 
andrew  he didn t do anything 
  what is wrong with you  it s over  okay 
he s out of your life 
why would you let him get away 
rachel  would you characterize
his conduct as extreme  andrew 
did he ever intentionally inflict
emotional distress 
this would not be a public hearing 
you know 
fletcher would never know
it was you who spoke up 
why would you do this to me 
do you think that i would let him
put my son through hell
and then just walk away
scot free 
don t you know
i would never let that happen 
that there is nothing in the world
more important to me than you 
don t you know that 
rachel 
andrew 
rachel 
andrew 
just tell me what to say 
hey 
man 1  on tv  
i d give anything to be there again this fall 
man 2 
i like weddings  provided they re not mine 
man 1 
marriages are very healthy 
married men live much longer
than bachelors 
man 2  they re trying to outlive their
wives so they can be bachelors again 
man 1 
haven t you thought of getting married 
man 2 
i did 
the young lady changed her mind
at the last moment 
i ve been deeply indebted to her
ever since 
and i loaded the pantry up
with gushers 
  saw that 
  okay 
alright 
thanks 
 band playing jazz music 
man 
right on  man 
 audience applauding 
 chattering 
fletcher 
andrew 
hey 
 jazz music
playing over speakers 
i don t know if you heard  uh   
i m not at shaffer anymore 
yeah  i did hear that 
did you quit 
not exactly 
some parents got a kid
from sean casey s year  i think 
to say some things
about me 
although why anybody
would have anything
other than peaches and cream
to say about me is a mystery 
 laughing 
yeah 
  that s a good laugh  right 
  i m sorry 
  no  listen   i get it 
  no  i m sorry 
i know i made enemies 
i m conducting a little  though 
they brought back the jvc fest
this year 
they got me opening
in a couple of weeks with a pro band 
that s great 
yeah  it s alright 
truth is 
i don t think people understood
what it was i was doing
at shaffer 
i wasn t there to conduct 
any fucking moron can wave his arms
and keep people in tempo 
i was there to push people
beyond what s expected of them 
i believe that is   
an absolute necessity 
otherwise  we re depriving the world
of the next louis armstrong 
the next charlie parker 
i told you about how charlie parker
became charlie parker  right 
  jo jones threw a cymbal at his head 
  exactly 
parker s a young kid 
pretty good on the sax 
gets up to play at a cutting session 
and he fucks it up 
and jones nearly decapitates him
for it 
and he s laughed off stage 
cries himself to sleep that night 
but the next morning  what does he do 
he practices 
and he practices and he practices
with one goal in mind 
never to be laughed at again 
and a year later  he goes back to
the reno and he steps up on that stage 
and plays the best motherfucking solo
the world has ever heard 
so imagine if jones had just said 
 well  that s okay  charlie 
that was alright  good job  
and then charlie thinks to himself 
 well  shit  i did do a pretty good job  
end of story 
no bird 
that  to me 
is an absolute tragedy 
but that s just
what the world wants now 
people wonder why jazz
is dying 
i tell you  man 
and every starbucks  jazz  album
just proves my point  really 
there are no two words
in the english language more harmful
than  good job  
but is there a line 
you know  maybe you go too far and
you discourage the next charlie parker
  from ever becoming charlie parker 
  no  man  no 
because the next charlie parker
would never be discouraged 
yeah 
the truth is  andrew  i   
never really had a charlie parker 
but i tried 
i actually fucking tried 
and that s more than
most people ever do 
and i will never apologize
for how i tried 
 sighs 
andrew 
i ll see you later 
fletcher 
yeah 
hey  andrew  listen  i have no idea
how you re gonna take this 
but the band i m leading for jvc 
my drummer is not cutting it 
you understand
what i m saying 
no 
i m using the studio band playlist 
you know   caravan    whiplash  
i need somebody
who really knows those charts 
what about ryan connolly 
all connolly ever was to me
was incentive for you 
  tanner 
  tanner switched to premed 
i guess he got discouraged 
hey  uh   
take the weekend 
think about it 
nicole  over phone   hello 
andrew  hey  nicole  it s andrew 
  hi 
  hey 
it s been a while since i talked to you 
um   
look  i   
i m really sorry about everything 
i know that s not  you know  enough 
but i m just really sorry  um   
but anyway  i got  
i actually have this show this weekend 
it s a  uh   
like  a jvc thing  and i didn t know
if maybe you d wanna go 
and we  you know  maybe
get some  like  pizza afterwards 
and  like  complain
about our schools again 
what is    you said jayvees 
no  it s  heh  jvc 
it s like a   it s a jazz thing 
yeah 
oh  okay 
well  i don t know if i can come  i
