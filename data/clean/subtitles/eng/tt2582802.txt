is that from drumming
andrew yeah its nothing
so hows it going
with the studio band
andrew
good
yeah i think he
likes me more now
and his opinion means a lot
to you doesnt it
yeah
wanna grab the shakers
man
jimbo overcooked
you can barely chew this
all laugh
frank he just laughs
so hows the drumming going andy
yeah its going really well
im the new core drummer so
all hey
emma congratulations
frank
tom brady
did you hear jim
no what
trav got named this years mvp
thats fantastic travis
emma yeah and dustin
is heading up model un
soon to be rhodes scholar
and who knows what else
and jim teacher of the year
well hey listen
emma i mean come on
the talent at this table
that is stunning
and andy with your drumming
its going okay andy
yeah its going really
really well actually
im part of shaffers
top jazz orchestra
which means
its the best in the country
and im a core member
so ill start playing
in competitions i just
i found out im
the youngest person in the band
how do you know who wins in
a music competition isnt it subjective
no
does the studio get you a job
its not an actual studio
its the name of the ensemble
but its a big step forward in my career
im so glad you figured it out
its a nasty business i am sure
hey are you gonna tell them
about your game this week
living up to your title
travis i scored a 93yard touchdown
frank
school record school record
is that true thats fantastic
its division three
its carlton football its not even
division two its division three
you got any friends andy
no
oh why is that
i dont know i never saw the use
who are you
gonna play with otherwise
lennon and mccartney they
were school buddies am i right
charlie parker didnt know anybody
till jo jones threw a cymbal at his head
thats your idea of success
being the greatest musician of the 20th
century is anybodys idea of success
dying broke and drunk
and full of heroin
at the age of 34
is not my idea of success
id rather die drunk broke at 34
and have people talk about me
than live to be rich and sober at 90
and nobody remember who i was
but your friends will remember you
thats the point
none of us were friends
with charlie parker thats the point
travis and dustin they have plenty
of friends and plenty of purpose
theyll make great
school board presidents
oh thats what this is all about
you think youre better than us
catch on quick are you in model un
i got a reply for you
you think carlton football is a joke
come play with us
four words you will never hear
from the nfl
who wants dessert
heard from lincoln center

andrew
im just gonna lay it out there
this is why i dont think
we should be together
and ive thought about it a lot
and this is whats gonna happen
im gonna keep pursuing
what im pursuing
because im doing that
its gonna take up my time
im not gonna be able
to spend time with you
even when i do im gonna
be thinking about drumming
about jazz my charts because of that
youre gonna start to resent me
youre gonna tell me to ease up on
the drumming spend more time with you
im not gonna be able to do that ill start
to resent you for even asking me to stop
were just gonna start to hate
each other its gonna be ugly
and so for those reasons
id rather just you know
break it off clean
because i wanna be great
and youre not
i wanna be one of the greats
and i would stop you
from doing that
yeah
you know i would stop you
from doing that
you know that for a fact
yes
and id barely see you anyway
yeah
when i see you youd treat me like shit
because im some girl
who doesnt know what she wants
you have a path youre going
to be great im gonna be forgotten
and you wont be able
to give me the time of day
because you have
bigger things to pursue
thats exactly my point

six years ago
i came across a kid in a
practice room working on his scales
he was early second year and hed
started at shaffer with a lot of hope
like all you guys
but the truth was that he barely
squeaked in to begin with
and he was really struggling
the faculty were all telling him
maybe this isnt for you
but they didnt see what i saw
this scared skinny kid
cursing himself because
he couldnt get his scales right
i saw a drive in him
and i put him in studio band
and when he graduated
marsalis made him third trumpet
at lincoln center
a year later he was first
thats who youre listening to now
his name was sean casey

with me
he suffered
from anxiety and depression
his mother claims this started
during his time as fletchers student

to make sure terence fletcher is never
allowed to do this to another student
andrew on screen
hey dad look at my paradiddle

emotional distress
this would not be a public hearing
you know
fletcher would never know
it was you who spoke up
why would you do this to me
do you think that i would let him
put my son through hell
and then just walk away
scotfree
dont you know
i would never let that happen
that there is nothing in the world
more important to me than you
dont you know that
rachel
andrew
rachel
andrew
just tell me what to say
hey
man 1 on tv
id give anything to be there again this fall
man 2
i like weddings provided theyre not mine
man 1
marriages are very healthy
married men live much longer
than bachelors
man 2 theyre trying to outlive their
wives so they can be bachelors again
man 1
havent you thought of getting married
man 2
i did
the young lady changed her mind
at the last moment
ive been deeply indebted to her
ever since
and i loaded the pantry up
with gushers
saw that
okay
alright
thanks
band playing jazz music
man
right on man
audience applauding
chattering
fletcher
andrew
hey
jazz music
playing over speakers
i dont know if you heard uh
im not at shaffer anymore
yeah i did hear that
did you quit
not exactly
some parents got a kid
from sean caseys year i think
to say some things
about me
although why anybody
would have anything
other than peaches and cream
to say about me is a mystery
laughing
yeah
thats a good laugh right
im sorry
no listen i get it
no im sorry
i know i made enemies
im conducting a little though
they brought back the jvc fest
this year
they got me opening
in a couple of weeks with a pro band
thats great
yeah its alright
truth is
i dont think people understood
what it was i was doing
at shaffer
i wasnt there to conduct
any fucking moron can wave his arms
and keep people in tempo
i was there to push people
beyond whats expected of them
i believe that is
an absolute necessity
otherwise were depriving the world
of the next louis armstrong
the next charlie parker
i told you about how charlie parker
became charlie parker right
jo jones threw a cymbal at his head
exactly
parkers a young kid
pretty good on the sax
gets up to play at a cutting session
and he fucks it up
and jones nearly decapitates him
for it
and hes laughed offstage
cries himself to sleep that night
but the next morning what does he do
he practices
and he practices and he practices
with one goal in mind
never to be laughed at again
and a year later he goes back to
the reno and he steps up on that stage
and plays the best motherfucking solo
the world has ever heard
so imagine if jones had just said
well thats okay charlie
that was alright good job
and then charlie thinks to himself
well shit i did do a pretty good job
end of story
no bird
that to me
is an absolute tragedy
but thats just
what the world wants now
people wonder why jazz
is dying
i tell you man
and every starbucks jazz album
just proves my point really
there are no two words
in the english language more harmful
than good job
but is there a line
you know maybe you go too far and
you discourage the next charlie parker
from ever becoming charlie parker
no man no
because the next charlie parker
would never be discouraged
yeah
the truth is andrew i
never really had a charlie parker
but i tried
i actually fucking tried
and thats more than
most people ever do
and i will never apologize
for how i tried
sighs
andrew
ill see you later
fletcher
yeah
hey andrew listen i have no idea
how youre gonna take this
but the band im leading for jvc
my drummer is not cutting it
you understand
what im saying
no
im using the studio band playlist
you know caravan whiplash
i need somebody
who really knows those charts
what about ryan connolly
all connolly ever was to me
was incentive for you
tanner
tanner switched to premed
