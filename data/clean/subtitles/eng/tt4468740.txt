well be in london
where the rivers run with marmalade
and the streets are paved with bread
did you read the book about london
i skimmed it
oh pastuzo
well reading makes me sleepy
but any city
that can come up with this
is all right by me
ooh pastuzo look
its its a cub
lucy
lower me down
be careful
lower pastuzo lower
lucy
lucy
im afraid were not going to london
after all
why not
weve got a cub to raise
whats he like
rather small
and rather sneezy
but he likes his marmalade
thats a good sign
oh yes pastuzo
if we look after this bear
i have a feeling hell go far
dear aunt lucy
i hope all is well
in the home for retired bears
life in london has been
better than ever this summer
ive really got to grips
with how things work
aaah
and it seems theres something new
to do every day
hm
guess what paddington
the steam fairs coming to town
im going along tonight
to write about it in my newspaper
whos going to want to read about that
everyone they travel the world
in an old steam train
i thought youd love it
i do dont tell anyone ok not cool
why dont we all go
good idea
your fathers a dab hand
at the coconut shy
bullseye brown they used to call him
not any more
coconuts are a young mans game
well i think youre in great shape
for a man your age mr brown
ah thank you paddington
hang on how old do you think i am
oh er about 80
eighty
at least
just a minute young bear
hm
thought i told you
to wash behind your ears
oh but i did mrs bird i
i wonder how that got in there
l really feel at home
in windsor gardens
bonjour mademoiselle
good morning paddington
i brought you breakfast
thank you
your sandwiches
always put me in a good mood
morning dr jafri
havent forgotten your keys have you
keys keys oh oh
well caught
thank you paddington
youre welcome glorious day colonel
is it how absolutely thrilling
how was your date miss kitts
well he wasnt the one
but you know what they say
plenty more fish in the sea
exactly
thank you
morning paddington
morning mr barnes
bye paddington
au revoir mademoiselle
right test me
whats the quickest way
from baker street to big ben
ah an easy one
turn right onto portman square left
everyone has been so kind
and welcoming
even though theyre very busy
mrs brown is planning to swim to france
it seems an awful lot of hard work
when you can go by boat or plane
or even train but thats not the point
shes been cooped up all summer
illustrating a series
of adventure stories
and has decided
she wants one of her own
whoohoo
judy has been suffering
from a broken heart
im dumped i think youll find
youre dumped tony
her first reaction was to become a nun
but she soon got over that
and has thrown herself into a new hobby
she found an old printing press
at school and is starting a newspaper
with no boys
now all we need is some news
jonathan is joining her
at big school this year
he spent the holidays
building a fully working steam engine
whoo
but im not supposed to talk about that
as its not cool
hes got a whole new look
and if anyone asks
hes now called jdog
and hes definitely not
into steam trains
those times
but mr brown has been busiest of all
he recently had a surprise at work
i am delighted to announce
our new head of risk analysis will be
mr steve visby
and this has prompted what mrs bird
calls a fullblown midlife crisis
it involves blending his food
painting his hair
and engaging in a process
called chakrabatics
open your mind
and your legs will follow
thank you paddington
keep up the good work
oh aunt lucy
you sent me to london to find a home
and its worked out better
than i ever imagined
i have a wonderful family
and have made friends
in all sorts of places
here boy
there you go wolfie
i do hope if you could see me
youd be pleased
lots of love from paddington
mr gruber
ah mr brown come in
i just had a visit from madame kozlova
who runs the fair
oh yes
they were having a clearout
and found all these old crates
stuffed full with memorybilia
they thought had been lost forever
she asked me if i would sell it
for them while theyre in town
and it struck me
there might be something in here
for your aunties birthday
oh good idea
ah look at this
its very nice mr gruber but
i know i know it has to be perfect
well since uncle pastuzo died
im the only relative shes got left
and it isnt every day
a bear turns a hundred
quite so ah
how about these rolling shoes
please mr gruber be serious
perhaps your aunties rolling days
are behind her
i think you might be right
oh whats this
ah
that must be the popping book
very interesting
really
you see
madame kozlovas greatgrandmother
who started the fair
was also a brilliant artist
and every time they visited a new city
she made a popping book
to remember it by
ohh
and this is london
oh mr gruber its wonderful
aunt lucy always dreamed
of coming to london and
never had the chance
but if she saw this
it would be like she were finally here
oh
aunt lucy aunt lucy
paddington
oop
come with me aunt lucy
oh yes please
i want to see everything
its just down here
get all your racing news
right here
well what do you think
its wonderful
right here ladies and gents
all aboard
one and a half bears please
mind your step madam
oh what a polite young man
what a polite young pigeon
its so echoey echoes around
sides turning
oh paddington
youve made an old bear so very happy
this is perfect
ahh
ahh
we have a snag
do we
you see this popping book
is the only one of its kind
and they want
rather a lot of money for it
oh well mrs bird found this coin
in my ear at breakfast
perhaps theres more
it would take
more than an earful mr brown
im afraid you would need
a thousand of those coins
oh
lets take another look at the monkey
i think hes superduper
oh
i can fix that
thats very kind mr gruber but
aunt lucy did so much for me
when i was a cub
and this could be my way
of saying thank you

and buy that book

hes right you know
you cant trust anyone
thats why
im doing my newspaper alone

im sorry im at my worst tonight
i really am i am
tickled the deepest shade of shrimp

of people like me whatever i am
vip celebrity i hate all that stuff

he was robbing you blind

just like the old days hm
why the lemon face hamlet
if you have something to say
i beg you share it with us all
it is not nor it cannot come to good
oh really
you and your dreary conscience

in the greatest oneman show
the west end has ever seen
bravo
oh thank you my darlings
thank you thank you
blessings upon you all
deepest of bows thank you
i know what youre thinking scrooge
itll cost a fortune

harleys gourmet dog food
not to be consumed by humans
court will rise
deep breath paddington
remember what mr brown said
youre young youve done
nothing wrong youll be fine
so long as you get
a fairminded judge
order order
oh dear
youll now hear the case
of the crown
versus paddington er brown
oh yes he loved the book
his heart was set on top of it
so you discussed how expensive it was
yes but he was earning the money
i refuse to believe that young mr brown
would ever burglarise my shop
exactly
indistinct chatter
paw prints
were found here here and here
and a substance
later identified as marmalade
was found here
and is this the same marmalade
yes it is
oh no
phoenix buchanan
do you swear to tell the truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
may my entrails be plucked forth
and wound about my neck
should i deceive i do
prison is no laughing matter
and i should know
i spent three years in les miserables
mr buchanan you live on the same street
as the defendant
i do
and you were an eye witness
to the events that night
indeed i was
i was up late when i became aware
of a hullabaloo in the street below
i went to my awards room
which is a large room
overlooking the newspaper kiosk
and i saw young paddington riding
a rather disreputablelooking hound
mary brown drew this
based on the bears description
of the man he claims he was chasing
hm
did you see him
on the street that night
oh a handsome devil isnt he hmm
dazzling eyes
yes but did you see him
your answer will tell us
whether the bear is guilty
did you see this man
alas
i did not
but perhaps hed already vanished
i beg you have mercy on him
he is but a cub
paddington brown
ten years for grand theft
oh but
and grievous barberly harm
follow me
oh um
mrs brown usually reads me
a story before bed i dont suppose
sorry son no bedtime stories in here
oh
dear aunt lucy a great deal
has happened since i last wrote
theres been a bit of a mixup
with your present
and the upshot is ive had to leave
windsor gardens and move
somewhere else
it isnt quite as charming
as the browns house
but its not all bad
its a period property in fact
its one of the most substantial
victorian buildings in london
and the security arrangements
are second to none
im only allowed to see the browns
once a month
i wonder what theyre doing now
i do hope they dont forget me
of course they wont paddington
this is the browns youre talking about
theyll sort everything out
and ill be able to go home
and get your present
and everything will be right as rain
taps pend
i just need to hold on till then
e
the hunt begins
threetwofive
threetwosix
th reetwoseven
here goes paddington manners
fall in
good morning how would you like
to start a gardening club
how would you like to be buried
in a very deep hole
after you
spooner r workshop
brown p laundry duty
right laundry
laundry laundry ah
laundry
hmm
oh
ugh
oh
hmm
oh its only one red sock
whats the worst that can happen
afternoon chaps
if you ask me the the pink
really brightens the place up a bit
if you ask me you should pipe down
and enjoy your dinner
cos it might be your last
ok
ugh
ah dont worry
i used to be a restaurant critic
its not as bad as it looks
oh
its worse
what is this
nobody knows
but weve been eating it
three times a day for the past ten year
why doesnt someone have a word
with the chef
with knuckles
two things to remember
if you want to survive in here
keep your head down
and never talk to knuckles
thank you
well i think its a great idea
tell you what son
you get knuckles to change the menu
and we might forget about you making us
look like a bunch of pink flamingos
all right then i will
oh you dont wanna do that
aunt lucy said lf you look for
the good in people youll find it
she obviously never met knuckles
um excuse me mr knuckles
yes
l just wondered if i could have
a quick word about the food
send a medic to the canteen
you want to
complain
oh no i i wouldnt say complain
oh thats a shame
because i just love it
when people complain
really
oh yeah
oh well in that case
its very gritty
and lum dy
and as for the bread
need i say more
i think we need to completely
overhaul the menu now
i know were working to a tight budget
but we could at least add some sauce
oh sorry about that ill just er
hmm no thats just rubbing it in
dont worry
i know what gets ketchup stains out
hang on was it mustard
hmm no
thats just made it worse
does anyone know what works on ketchup
chaps
forget the medic better send a priest
you listen to me you little maggot
listening
nobody criticises my food
right
nobody squirts condiments on my apron
got it
and nobody
bonks me on the head
with a baguette
no bonking
ill overhaul the menu all right
really
dish of the day
yes
bear die
i dont like it
what is this
lts a marmalade sandwich
marmalade
my aunt lucy taught me to make them
you mean you can make this
well yes
stand aside
get up off the floor
you bunch of yellowbellies
listen to me
this bear is now under my protection
oh
anyone who touches a hair on his back
will answer to knuckles mcginty
thats knuckles with a capital n
thank you mr mcginty
dont thank me yet
i dont do nothin for no one
for nothin
b99 your pardon
you get my protection so long as
you make that marmalade deal
deal
somebodys got to recognise him
sooner or later
hmm
you all right mr gruber
theres something
about this whole business
that has been tickling my brainbox
what is it
on the night of the robbery
when young mr brown called out
the thief took to his heels
and ran down the stairs
came straight through the shop
and out the front door
setting off the alarm
ah but thats the thing
he didnt go straight through the shop
no
he came all the way over here
to get the popping book
why not some jewellery or a vase
theyre much closer far more valuable
he cant know much about antiques
no unless
he knows something about that book
that we dont
you may find this hard
to believe madame kozlova
but paddington is innocent
and we think that the real thief
may have broken into mr grubers
just to steal
your greatgrandmothers popup book
the popup book
i know it sounds farfetched
but is there anything
you could tell us about that book
anything at all could be helpful
thats quite a story
oh really
come with me
ill show you where it all happened
you see my greatgrandmother
who started this fair
was the finest show woman
of her generation
she could tame lions
breathe fire swallow swords
but she was most famous
for the trapeze
they called her the flying swan
bravo
wherever she went
she was showered with gifts
and made a fortune
but where there is a fortune
there is also jealousy
the magician wanted it for himself
and the flying swan
became the dying swan
he went to her caravan
and opened her strongbox
but instead of her treasure
all he found was one
of her popup books
twelve landmarks of london
they had him cornered
but he vanished
and neither he nor the treasure
were ever heard of again
i knew there was something special
about that popup book
hmm
why else would she have kept it
in her strongbox
youre not telling me
you believed all that guff are you
madame kozlova drew
12 london landmarks in that book
yes
well what if theyre not
just landmarks what if theyre
i dont know clues
clues
to where she hid her fortune
you mean a treasure map
exactly
oh
and thats why the thief
took it from mr grubers
first thing tomorrow we need to go
to every landmark in that book
see if we can sniff out
anything suspicious
too many adventure stories mary
what
shes a fortune teller
she spun you a yarn its what they do
honestly henry
youre so closedminded these days
whats that supposed to mean
what happened to the man i married
hed have believed me
oh him
hes gone
what
im afraid your husbands
just a creaky old man
hes not bullseye brown
oh lord
bullseye
oh henry
henry henry
anyway the point is
were not going to help paddington
by going on a wildgoose chase
were looking for this scruffy chancer
not some swashbuckling pirate
hunting for buried treasure
i think theres more to him
than meets the eye
i think he somehow knew the story
of the koslova fortune
and is out there right now
trying to find it
well grandfather
tonight we go in search
of clue number two
the setting
st pauls cathedral
but how to slip in unobserved
enter sister isabella
wakeywakey
marmalade time
there you go lads good luck
um mr mcginty
what do you want
well the thing is
im actually innocent
and i wondered if you had any advice
on how to clear my name
now that were friends
friends
im your boss not your buddy
oh well after you
why so you can stab me in the back
no because its polite
aunt lucy said lf were kind
and polite the world will be right
you were ahead of me
and now youre behind
that makes you a sap
lngredients are over there
um arent you going to help
nope now get on with it
but theres 500 hungry prisoners
coming for breakfast
so well need a thousand juicy oranges
oh and rule number one no talking
rule number two
hmm
no humming
but
or singing
l
or any other expression of bonhomie
oh dear
ooh thats heavy
come on
put your back into it
oh
help
these sacks are awfully heavy
well take them one at a time then
right
one at a
time
one juicy orange
two juicy oranges
three juicy oranges
four juicy
now what are you doing
taking them one at a time
one sack at a time
im sorry im finding this
a very stressful working environment
aunt lucy said
aunt lucy
lve had it up to here with aunt lucy
oh
she sounds like a proper old bag to me
i beg your pardon
i said
your aunt lucy sounds like
one of the most naive
gullible mushybrained
whats going on
why are you looking at me like that
its awful hot in here
are you hot im hot
did i leave the oven on
its called a hard stare
aunt lucy taught me to do them
when people had forgotten their manners
you dont have to tell me
about hard stares
i practically invented them
pretty good for a bear though
ill give you that
now mr mcginty
i may look like a hardened criminal
to you but i really am innocent
and if youre not going to help me
clear my name
you could at least
help me make this marmalade
all right ill help
thank you
not gonna be much use to you though
these werent exactly made for cooking
i dont know
looks to me like youve got yourself
a fine pair of orange squeezers
orange squeezers
good
no better
tomato lovely
yes spot on
now we have to be very careful
with knives
aunt lucy said that sensible bears
where on earth did you learn
to use a knife like that
you dont wanna know
well its jolly good
now
now
right its time for the sugar
ok
thats what turns the juice
into marmalade
how much
ooh a lot
same again
ah
a squeeze of lemon a pinch of cinnamon
and just a bit more sugar
well is it good
ooh its too soon to tell
well only really know once its set
designed by sir christopher wren
st pauls cathedral is one
of londons most famous landmarks
sadly the great dome
is closed to visitors today
as one of its statues was destroyed
in a bizarre accident last night
but if you follow me this way
excuse me what happened here
a nun went berserk
really
it happens
the police have rounded them all up
for questioning
hold it there sister
youre going nowhere
till the detective says so
spin it around
mind you if you ask me
the real culprit slipped the net
what makes you say that
cos i saw her thats what
i was on patrol in the upper dome
watching the nuns parade far below
when something caught my eye
one of them broke free from the herd
and made her way
to the whispering gallery
only the good lord knows
what she was doing up there
c
but she was never
gonna get away with it
not while im vice deputy head
of security
oi
attention all units
an unusually attractive nun
is causing mayhem in the cathedral dome
activate emergency protocol
stop that stunning sister
i set off at lightning speed
but by the time wed locked the place
down shed vanished into the night
good evening my son
oh er good evening your grace
good evening
most beautiful woman ive seen
in a loooong time
do you think you might be able
to describe her
it would be my pleasure
gentlemen for breakfast this morning
chef mcginty would like to propose
an orange marmalade
served on a bed
of warm crustless bread
topped with another piece
of warm crustless bread
bon appétit
two choices take it or leave it
are you all right knuckles
yes
why dont you come and join the others
dont want to
are you scared what they might think

is part of a criminal gang
using the popup book
as a treasure map
well its a theory
have you found out who they are

i hope i can rely on your vote
and charley rumble
oh its so wonderful to meet you all
i must say its a great relief
to know that paddingtons already made
such sweet friends
would you excuse us a moment
what are you doing
talking to the nice men
nice men
mary we cant trust these people
i mean look at them
talk about a rogues gallery hideous
as for that bearded baboon in the
middle hes hardly got two brain cells
to rub together
we can still hear you mr brown
that was the light you turned off
the microphone is on the other side
its got microphone written on it
gentlemen
if i have offended you in any way
dont worry about it
were fond of the little fella
and lets face it if anyone
can recognise a criminal gang its us
wed be grateful for any help
please
well knuckles
im afraid i dont recognise
any of them lads
im afraid i couldnt possibly comment
sorry to say it kid
but your friends
are barking up the wrong tree
a nun a beefeater and a king
sounds more like a fancy dress party
than a criminal gang
then
what are we going to do now
oh
watch where youre going
so sorry sorry
sorry i get grumpy
when i havent had breakfast
keys keys keys
bottoms
turn left
you cant park here
lm not parked im doing the bins
youre not doing the bins sunshine
youre studying on council time
lm gonna report you and your hat
morning miss kitts colonel
oh morning mrs brown
judy asked me to drop these off to you
propaganda
you are wasting your time
trying to peddle that rubbish
everyone round here
knows it was your bear that done it
and this street
is a far far better place without him
w hat
oi its that mangy dog
you are going to the pound my son
barking without a licence
in a builtup area
give em here
ill ticket you
i have to sell them under the counter
for obvious reasons
but people are buying em
really
lts a bloomin good read hm
made a few people round here think twice
about your young bear
you just need to find that thief
oh were trying
dont suppose you know where he is
do you feathers
hes behind you
sorry what
cooeel
mary
oh hello phoenix
why dont you come on in
i want to hear all about
the investigation yeah
mysterious things
have been happening all over town
ch yes
strange characters turning up
at every landmark in that book
are they
i dont know
perhaps its just a coincidence
henry says i let my imagination
get the better of me
well youre an artist mary like me
our imaginations run free
like bison upon the plain
but can i just say
in this particular case
i think dear old henry
might have a point
do you
but i do have
a little bit of good news
that might turn your frown upside down
oh yes
hlooksu
fingers fingers fingers
as though the funding may be
coming through for my oneman show
oh right
lts an evening of monologue and song
featuring some of
my better known characters
would you like a little preview
um
picture this scene
darkness then suddenly spotlight
me ping
oh mary you look sad
you dont like musicals
no no no no
i suppose it just seems so unfair
paddingtons in prison and yet
life carries on
oh i know
it must be so hard to accept
that he won
that man with the dazzling blue eyes
i beg your pardon
the man in the poster
your wonderful drawing
yes but
how do you know he had blue eyes
hm
lts just a pencil sketch
ooh
well i must have coloured him in
yeah
phoenix buchanan
hes a master of disguise
shes gone mad
think about it henry
someone out there knows
about the kozlova fortune right
alleged fortune
knuckles said we werent looking
for a criminal gang
knuckles
because there was no gang
it was one man
feathers knew all along
feathers whos feathers
hm
the parrot at the newsstand
no
can we just return to planet earth
for a moment
phoenix buchanan is a highly respected
awardwinning actor
and a member of our platinum club
he is not a petty thief
hang on a minute henry
but lets just assume im wrong
shall we
ok
and that the fortune teller
career criminal and parrot are right
mm
may i remind you
that you dont actually have any proof
er
now if anyone wants me
i shall be putting up posters
hes right
well i believe you mary
actors are some of the most evil
devious people on the planet
are they
they lie for a living
crikey
if were gonna catch one
yes
were gonna need a foolproof plan
oh
bamfing on pipe
paddington
oh
paddington
knuckles
got a proposition for you kid
me and the boys have been talking
and seems to us
if youre gonna clear your name
youre gonna need our help
the browns may mean well but
it takes a thief to catch a thief
ohh
now if we could figure a way
out of here and hit the streets
wed find this guy soon enough
but that would mean escape
it certainly would and we got a plan
but its a fourman job
so we need your help
what do you say kid
its very kind of you knuckles but
i dont think aunt lucy
would like the idea of us
breaking out of prison
the browns will find the real thief
i just need to be patient
you may not wanna hear this kid
but sooner or later the browns well
theyll forget you
they always do
theyll miss one visit
then two
before you know it
you wont have a home to go back to
youre wrong knuckles
youre all wrong
the browns arent like that
theyll come tomorrow
and theyll have good news
youll see
hello
its judy brown
from the portobello express

so whats this for darlings
school newspaper

we thought the agent of the phoenix
buchanan would be really interesting
and youd be right

and ive only given you that
because youve brought breakfast

mr buchanan back on stage
phoenix oh

werent it eh
too close if you ask me
hold your nerve macbeth
screw your courage to the
sticking place we are so nearly there
i have followed this lady
through the whole of london
and collected every one
of her clever little clues
aye but what do they mean
its just a jumble of letters aint it
au contraire mon ami
uhuh they are not letters at all
they are musical notes
indeed poirot
and i believe i know
just where to play them
hold it
that is an amazing story
but all you can actually prove
is that phoenix buchanan
keeps his old costumes
bring me some hard evidence
bring me the book with his fingerprints
on and then youve got a case
but until then
theres nothing i can do
lm sorry
what
where shes wheres she going
what do we do now
i dont know
well at least we can tell paddington
we know who did it
oh no

im so sorry i escaped mrs brown
but i thought youd forgotten me
oh wed never forget you paddington
paddington
youre family
we know who the thief was
its phoenix buchanan
mr buchanan
but hes disappeared into thin air
weve been looking for him
at every landmark in that book
every last page
where all your dreams come true
why do you say that
oh it was written on the last page
of the popup book
always made me think of aunt lucy
thats very bizarre
ls it
i found that exact same phrase on
a scrap of paper in phoenixs house
really
lm sure ive seen that before
look
where all your dreams come true
the organ
that must be where
madame kozlova hid her fortune
lets get to the fair
lts too late theyre leaving today
from paddington station
at 635
theres still time
paddington head for the station
if we can find phoenix
and get hold of that book
his fingerprints will prove everything
but thats miles away mr brown i
ill see you there
clear the road
this is a refuse emergency
sorry
fellow citizens
ive just received intelligence
the bear has escaped
and may be heading this way
i have raised the neighbourhood
panic level to wild hysteria
get out of the way mr curry
paddingtons not coming this way
hes gonna clear his name
and were gonna bring him home
we dont want him here
no of course you dont you never have
as soon as you set eyes on that bear
you made up your mind about him
well paddingtons not like that
he looks for the good in all of us
and somehow he finds it
its why he makes friends
wherever he goes
and its why windsor gardens
is a happier place whenever hes around
he wouldnt hesitate
if any of us needed help
so stand aside mr curry
cos were coming through
nice try brown
your plan seems to have stalled
like your vehicle
try the choke go on try the choke
youre flooding it
clutch down second gear mr brown

i would be permanently
locked out of my house
id say youve rather a lot
to be proud of
oh
when we heard the police
wanted the popping book for evidence
we thought wed find aunt lucy
another present
so we all clubbed together
i pulled in a few favours
from my old air force chums
and we think shes going to love it
but what is it
you wanted to get that book so
aunt lucy could see london didnt you
it was always her dream
well we thought
why look at london in a book
when she could see the real thing
why dont you go and answer that
oh
oh
paddington
happy birthday aunt lucy

and a disgrace
