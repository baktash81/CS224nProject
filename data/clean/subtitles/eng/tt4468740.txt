we ll be in london 
where the rivers run with marmalade
and the streets are paved with bread 
did you read the book about london 
  i skimmed it 
  oh  pastuzo 
well  reading makes me sleepy 
but any city
that can come up with this   
   is all right by me 
ooh  pastuzo  look 
it s    it s a cub 
lucy 
lower me down 
be careful 
lower  pastuzo  lower 
lucy 
lucy 
i m afraid we re not going to london
after all 
why not 
we ve got a cub to raise 
what s he like 
rather small 
and rather sneezy 
but he likes his marmalade 
that s a good sign 
oh  yes  pastuzo 
if we look after this bear 
i have a feeling he ll go far 
dear aunt lucy 
i hope all is well
in the home for retired bears 
life in london has been
better than ever this summer 
i ve really got to grips
with how things work 
aaah 
and it seems there s something new
to do every day 
hm 
guess what  paddington 
the steam fair s coming to town 
i m going along tonight
to write about it in my newspaper 
who s going to want to read about that 
everyone  they travel the world
in an old steam train 
i thought you d love it 
i do  don t tell anyone  ok  not cool 
  why don t we all go 
  good idea 
your father s a dab hand
at the coconut shy 
  bullseye brown they used to call him 
  not any more 
coconuts are a young man s game 
well  i think you re in great shape
for a man your age  mr brown 
ah  thank you  paddington 
hang on  how old do you think i am 
oh  er  about 80 
  eighty 
  at least 
  just a minute  young bear 
  hm 
thought i told you
to wash behind your ears 
oh  but i did  mrs bird  i   
i wonder how that got in there 
l really feel at home
in windsor gardens 
  bonjour  mademoiselle 
  good morning  paddington 
  i brought you breakfast 
  thank you 
your sandwiches
always put me in a good mood 
morning  dr jafri 
haven t forgotten your keys  have you 
keys  keys  oh  oh 
  well caught 
  thank you  paddington 
you re welcome  glorious day  colonel 
is it  how absolutely thrilling 
how was your date  miss kitts 
well  he wasn t the one 
but you know what they say 
  plenty more fish in the sea 
  exactly 
thank you 
  morning  paddington 
  morning  mr barnes 
  bye  paddington 
  au revoir  mademoiselle 
right  test me 
what s the quickest way
from baker street to big ben 
ah  an easy one 
turn right onto portman square  left   
everyone has been so kind
and welcoming 
even though they re very busy 
mrs brown is planning to swim to france 
it seems an awful lot of hard work
when you can go by boat or plane
or even train  but that s not the point 
she s been cooped up all summer
illustrating a series
of adventure stories
and has decided
she wants one of her own 
whoo hoo 
judy has been suffering
from a broken heart 
i m dumped  i think you ll find
you re dumped  tony 
her first reaction was to become a nun 
but she soon got over that
and has thrown herself into a new hobby 
she found an old printing press
at school and is starting a newspaper 
with no boys 
now all we need is some news 
jonathan is joining her
at big school this year 
    he spent the holidays
 building a fully working steam engine 
  whoo 
but i m not supposed to talk about that
as it s  not cool  
   he s got a whole new look
and if anyone asks 
he s now called j dog
and he s definitely not
into steam trains 
   those times   
  but mr brown has been busiest of all 
he recently had a surprise at work 
i am delighted to announce
our new head of risk analysis will be   
mr steve visby 
and this has prompted what mrs bird
calls  a full blown midlife crisis  
it involves blending his food 
painting his hair 
and engaging in a process
called chakrabatics 
open your mind
and your legs will follow 
  thank you  paddington 
  keep up the good work 
oh  aunt lucy 
you sent me to london to find a home 
and it s worked out better
than i ever imagined 
i have a wonderful family 
and have made friends
in all sorts of places 
here  boy 
there you go  wolfie 
i do hope if you could see me 
you d be pleased 
  lots of love  from paddington 
  mr gruber 
  ah  mr brown  come in 
i just had a visit from madame kozlova
who runs the fair 
  oh  yes 
  they were having a clear out
and found all these old crates
stuffed full with  memory bilia 
they thought had been lost forever 
she asked me if i would sell it
for them while they re in town 
and it struck me
there might be something in here
for your auntie s birthday 
oh  good idea 
ah  look at this 
 it s very nice  mr gruber  but   
  i know  i know  it has to be perfect 
well  since uncle pastuzo died 
i m the only relative she s got left 
and it isn t every day
a bear turns a hundred 
quite so  ah 
how about these rolling shoes 
please  mr gruber  be serious 
perhaps your auntie s rolling days
are behind her 
i think you might be right 
  oh  what s this 
  ah 
that must be the popping book 
very interesting 
really 
you see 
madame kozlova s great grandmother 
who started the fair 
was also a brilliant artist 
and every time they visited a new city 
she made a popping book
 to remember it by 
  ohh 
and this is london 
oh  mr gruber  it s wonderful 
aunt lucy always dreamed
of coming to london and   
never had the chance 
but if she saw this   
it would be like she were finally here 
oh 
aunt lucy  aunt lucy 
paddington 
oop 
come with me  aunt lucy 
oh  yes  please 
i want to see everything 
it s just down here 
get all your racing news
right here 
  well  what do you think 
  it s wonderful 
right here  ladies and gents   
all aboard 
one and a half bears  please 
  mind your step  madam 
  oh  what a polite young man 
what a polite young pigeon 
it s so echoey  echoes around 
sides turning 
oh  paddington 
you ve made an old bear so very happy 
this is perfect 
  ahh 
  ahh 
  we have a snag 
  do we 
you see  this popping book
is the only one of its kind 
and they want
rather a lot of money for it 
oh  well  mrs bird found this coin
in my ear at breakfast 
perhaps there s more 
it would take
more than an earful  mr brown 
i m afraid you would need
a thousand of those coins 
oh 
let s take another look at the monkey 
i think he s super duper 
  oh 
  i can fix that 
that s very kind  mr gruber  but   
aunt lucy did so much for me
when i was a cub
and this could be my way
of saying thank you 
i m going to get a job
and buy that book 
back in a few minutes 
paddington  ciao ciao 
ciao ciao  mr giuseppe 
good afternoon

  well  get it off 
yes  sir  right away  sir 
oh  yuck  what is the matter with you 
  paddington 
  mr giuseppe  i can explain   
lt s really not as bad as it looks 
have you ever been fired  mr brown 
well  no  but are you quite sure you re
ready for the workplace  paddington 
it s a tough 
competitive world out there
and i worry a good natured little bear
might get trampled underfoot 
he s right  you know 
you can t trust anyone 
that s why
i m doing my newspaper alone 
darling  is this about tony 
  no 
  everything s about tony 
the reason no one s helping
with your paper is because it s so lame 
well  at least i m not pretending
to be someone i m not 
nor am i  g man 
  j dog 
  spud bounce 
but aunt lucy said   lf we re kind
and polite  the world will be right  
  at least someone s making sense 
  oh  sorry 
and you re kind  mr brown 
and you made it to the top 
i m nowhere near the top 
i peaked in the middle 
now my hair s gone grey  my belly s
popped out  and i ve started to creak 
oh 
doesn t that man live in the big house
on the corner 
  it s phoenix buchanan 
  dad s celebrity client 
he s one of our platinum club members 
and a very famous actor 
or used to be 
  now he just does dog food commercials 
  hm 
mrs bird doesn t like him
because he can never remember her name 
now then  simmer down  simmer   
all right  little bit more 
that s enough 
i m sorry  i m at my worst tonight 
i really am  i am   
tickled the deepest shade of shrimp
to have been asked here tonight
to open this wonderful old steam fair 
but you know  when madame kozlova
created this thing all those years ago 
she most certainly was not thinking
of people like me  whatever i am 
vip  celebrity  i hate all that stuff 
no  no   
west end legend  that s another one 
no  no  she was thinking of you guys 
huh  the ordinary people 
so  i m going to ask one of you
to come up here and open the fair 
volunteers  anyone 
ooh 
eeny  meeny  miney   
  beah
let s have the young bear  why not 
  come  come  young ursine

oh  yes  you re a very famous actor 
  oh  pooh 
  or used to be 
now you do dog food commercials 
  well  a man has to eat 
  what  dog food 
oh  very  very funny 
anyway  they do say
that at madame kozlova s 
all your dreams come true 
so  if you had one wish tonight 
what would it be 
oh  that s easy  i d like to get
my aunt lucy a birthday present 
  aww 
  darling 
i ve got my eye
on an old pop up book of london 
made by madame kozlova  as it happens 
the only problem is
it s rather expensive 
so i need to get my paws
on an awful lot of money 
well  i m not sure
that we can offer you that 
but we can of course offer you
0 0 0 odles of fun 
so  if you would like to lend me a paw 
we now declare k0zl0va s steam fair   
   open 
thank you  thank you very much

mrs brown

where on earth did you find it 
oh  at mr gruber s antique shop 
he s keeping it to one side for me
but i really need a job 
i don t suppose you have any advice 
do you

  there must be some mistake 
  no mistake  sir 
  what s happened

  what 
  robbing gruber s antiques 
  well  well  well 
the truth is out 
we opened our hearts to that bear 
we opened our doors 
well  you did  i kept mine triple locked
in accordance with the guidelines 
and all along   
he was robbing you blind 
paddington 
oh  no 
  paddington 
  oh  dear 
a nice little haul  and no mistake 
turned out to be quite a stroke of luck 
that bear turning up when he did 
coppers think he done it 
we re in the clear 
indeed  magwitch 
and we gave quite a performance 
you and i 
just like the old days  hm 
why the lemon face  hamlet 
if you have something to say 
i beg you share it with us all 
 it is not nor it cannot come to good  
oh  really 
you and your dreary conscience 
tell me this 
which would you rather 
that you stand here gathering dust
while i humiliate myself
in a spaniel s costume on television 
or that we all return in glory
in the greatest one man show
the west end has ever seen 
bravo 
oh  thank you  my darlings 
thank you  thank you 
blessings upon you all 
deepest of bows  thank you 
i know what you re thinking  scrooge 
it ll cost a fortune 
but if i m right  that is exactly
what this book will provide 
this is no dusty antique 
hidden on every page 
a little lady pointing to a clue 
find all the clues    we re rich again 
and our dog food days are done 
dinner is served  master 
thank you  simkins 
if  like me  your doggie
likes to maintain standards

harley s gourmet dindins

dare one say    class 
  mmm 
  harley s gourmet dog food 
   not to be consumed by humans 
court will rise 
deep breath  paddington 
remember what mr brown said 
 you re young  you ve done
nothing wrong  you ll be fine  
 so long as you get
a fair minded judge  
order  order   
  oh  dear 
  you ll now hear the case
of the crown
versus paddington  er    brown 
oh  yes  he loved the book 
his heart was set on top of it 
so you discussed how expensive it was 
yes  but he was earning the money 
i refuse to believe that young mr brown
would ever burglarise my shop 
  exactly 
 indistinct chatter 
paw prints
were found here  here and here 
and a substance
later identified as marmalade
was found here 
and is this the same marmalade 
  yes  it is 
  oh  no 
phoenix buchanan 
do you swear to tell the truth 
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth 
may my entrails be plucked forth
and wound about my neck
should i deceive  i do 
prison is no laughing matter 
and i should know 
i spent three years in les miserables 
mr buchanan  you live on the same street
as the defendant 
  i do 
  and you were an eye witness
 to the events that night 
  indeed i was 
i was up late  when i became aware
of a hullabaloo in the street below 
i went to my awards room
which is a    large room
overlooking the newspaper kiosk 
and i saw young paddington riding
a rather disreputable looking hound 
mary brown drew this
based on the bear s description
of the man he claims he was chasing 
  hm 
  did you see him
 on the street that night 
  oh  a handsome devil  isn t he  hmm 
  dazzling eyes 
  yes  but did you see him 
your answer will tell us
whether the bear is guilty 
  did you see this man 
alas   
i did not 
but perhaps he d already vanished 
i beg you  have mercy on him 
he is but a cub 
paddington brown 
ten years for grand theft   
oh  but   
   and grievous  barberly  harm 
follow me 
oh  um   
mrs brown usually reads me
a story before bed  i don t suppose    
sorry  son  no bedtime stories in here 
oh 
dear aunt lucy  a great deal
has happened since i last wrote 
there s been a bit of a mix up
with your present
and the upshot is i ve had to leave
windsor gardens and move   
somewhere else 
it isn t quite as charming
as the browns  house 
but it s not all bad 
it s a period property  in fact 
it s one of the most substantial
victorian buildings in london 
and the security arrangements
are second to none 
i m only allowed to see the browns
once a month 
i wonder what they re doing now 
i do hope they don t forget me 
of course they won t  paddington 
this is the browns you re talking about 
they ll sort everything out 
and i ll be able to go home
and get your present 
 and everything will be right as rain 
 taps pend 
i just need to hold on till then 
e  
the hunt begins 
three two five 
three two six 
th ree two seven 
here goes  paddington  manners 
fall in 
good morning  how would you like
to start a gardening club 
how would you like to be buried
in a very deep hole 
after you 
spooner  r  workshop 
brown  p  laundry duty 
right  laundry 
laundry  laundry    ah 
laundry 
hmm   
oh 
ugh 
oh 
hmm 
oh  it s only one red sock 
what s the worst that can happen 
afternoon  chaps 
if you ask me  the    the pink
really brightens the place up a bit 
if you ask me  you should pipe down
and enjoy your dinner 
cos it might be your last 
ok 
ugh 
ah  don t worry 
i used to be a restaurant critic 
  it s not as bad as it looks 
  oh 
 it s worse 
  what is this 
  nobody knows 
but we ve been eating it
three times a day for the past ten year 
why doesn t someone have a word
with the chef 
with knuckles 
two things to remember
if you want to survive in here 
keep your head down 
and never talk to knuckles 
  thank you 
  well  i think it s a great idea 
tell you what  son 
you get knuckles to change the menu
and we might forget about you making us
look like a bunch of pink flamingos 
  all right then  i will 
  oh  you don t wanna do that 
aunt lucy said   lf you look for
the good in people  you ll find it  
she obviously never met knuckles 
um  excuse me  mr knuckles 
yes 
l just wondered if i could have
a quick word about the food 
send a medic to the canteen 
you want to   
complain 
  oh  no  i    i wouldn t say complain 
  oh  that s a shame 
because i just love it
when people complain 
  really 
  oh  yeah 
oh  well  in that case 
it s very gritty 
and lum dy 
and as for the bread   
need i say more 
i think we need to completely
overhaul the menu  now   
i know we re working to a tight budget 
but we could at least add some sauce 
oh  sorry about that  i ll just  er   
hmm  no  that s just rubbing it in 
don t worry 
i know what gets ketchup stains out 
hang on  was it mustard 
hmm    no 
that s just made it worse 
does anyone know what works on ketchup 
chaps 
forget the medic  better send a priest 
  you listen to me  you little maggot 
  listening 
  nobody criticises my food 
  right 
nobody squirts condiments on my apron 
  got it 
  and nobody
bonks me on the head
with a baguette 
  no bonking 
  i ll overhaul the menu all right 
  really 
  dish of the day 
 yes 
bear die 
i don t like it 
  what is this 
 lt s a marmalade sandwich 
marmalade 
my aunt lucy taught me to make them 
you mean  you can make this 
  well  yes 
  stand aside 
get up off the floor 
you bunch of yellow bellies 
listen to me 
this bear is now under my protection 
  oh 
  anyone who touches a hair on his back
will answer to knuckles mcginty 
that s knuckles with a capital n 
  thank you  mr mcginty 
  don t thank me yet 
i don t do nothin  for no one
for nothin  
b99 your pardon 
you get my protection  so long as
you make that marmalade  deal 
deal 
somebody s got to recognise him
sooner or later 
hmm 
you all right  mr gruber 
there s something
about this whole business
 that has been tickling my brainbox 
  what is it 
on the night of the robbery 
when young mr brown called out 
the thief took to his heels
and ran down the stairs 
came straight through the shop
and out the front door 
setting off the alarm 
ah  but that s the thing 
he didn t go straight through the shop 
  no 
  he came all the way over here
to get the popping book 
why not some jewellery or a vase 
they re much closer  far more valuable 
he can t know much about antiques 
no  unless   
he knows something about that book
that we don t 
you may find this hard
to believe  madame kozlova 
but paddington is innocent 
and we think that the real thief
may have broken into mr gruber s
just to steal
your great grandmother s pop up book 
  the pop up book 
  i know it sounds far fetched 
but is there anything
you could tell us about that book 
anything at all could be helpful 
  that s quite a story 
  oh  really 
come with me 
i ll show you where it all happened 
you see  my great grandmother 
who started this fair 
was the finest show woman
of her generation 
she could tame lions 
breathe fire  swallow swords 
but she was most famous   
for the trapeze 
  they called her the flying swan 
  bravo 
wherever she went 
she was showered with gifts 
and made a fortune 
but where there is a fortune 
there is also jealousy 
the magician wanted it for himself 
  and the flying swan   
   became the dying swan 
he went to her caravan
and opened her strongbox 
but instead of her treasure 
all he found was one
of her pop up books 
   twelve landmarks of london   
they had him cornered 
but he vanished 
and neither he nor the treasure
were ever heard of again 
i knew there was something special
about that pop up book 
hmm 
why else would she have kept it
in her strongbox 
you re not telling me
you believed all that guff  are you 
madame kozlova drew
12 london landmarks in that book 
yes 
well  what if they re not
just landmarks  what if they re   
  i don t know  clues 
  clues 
  to where she hid her fortune 
  you mean a treasure map 
  exactly 
  oh    
and that s why the thief
took it from mr gruber s 
first thing tomorrow  we need to go
to every landmark in that book 
see if we can sniff out
anything suspicious 
  too many adventure stories  mary 
  what 
she s a fortune teller 
she spun you a yarn  it s what they do 
honestly  henry 
you re so closed minded these days 
  what s that supposed to mean 
  what happened to the man i married 
  he d have believed me 
  oh  him 
  he s gone 
  what 
i m afraid your husband s
just a creaky old man 
  he s not bullseye brown 
  oh  lord 
bullseye 
oh  henry 
henry  henry 
anyway  the point is 
we re not going to help paddington
by going on a wild goose chase 
we re looking for this scruffy chancer 
not some swashbuckling pirate
hunting for buried treasure 
i think there s more to him
than meets the eye 
i think he somehow knew the story
of the koslova fortune
and is out there right now
trying to find it 
well  grandfather

  wakey wakey 
marmalade time 
there you go  lads  good luck 
  um  mr mcginty

on how to clear my name 
now that we re friends 
friends 
i m your boss  not your buddy 
oh  well  after you 
why  so you can stab me in the back 
no  because it s polite 
aunt lucy said   lf we re kind
and polite  the world will be right  
you were ahead of me
and now you re behind 
that makes you a sap 
lngredients are over there 
um  aren t you going to help 
nope  now get on with it 
but there s 500 hungry prisoners
coming for breakfast 
so we ll need a thousand juicy oranges 
oh  and rule number one  no talking 
  rule number two 
  hmm 
no humming 
  but

a very stressful working environment 
  aunt lucy said   
  aunt lucy 
 l ve had it up to here with aunt lucy 
  oh 
she sounds like a proper old bag to me 
i beg your pardon  
i said   
your aunt lucy sounds like
one of the most naive 
gullible  mushy brained   
what s going on 
why are you looking at me like that 
it s awful hot in here 
are you hot  i m hot 
did i leave the oven on 
it s called a hard stare 
aunt lucy taught me to do them
when people had forgotten their manners 
you don t have to tell me
about hard stares 
i practically invented them 
pretty good for a bear though 
i ll give you that 
now  mr mcginty 
i may look like a hardened criminal
to you  but i really am innocent 
and if you re not going to help me
clear my name 
you could at least
help me make this marmalade 
all right  i ll help 
  thank you 
  not gonna be much use to you though 
these weren t exactly made for cooking 
i don t know 
looks to me like you ve got yourself
a fine pair of orange squeezers 
orange squeezers 
good 
no  better 
tomato  lovely 
yes  spot on 
now  we have to be very careful
with knives 
aunt lucy said that sensible bears   
where on earth did you learn
to use a knife like that 
you don t wanna know 
well  it s jolly good 
  now 
now 
  right  it s time for the sugar 
  ok 
that s what turns the juice
into marmalade 
  how much 
  ooh  a lot 
same again 
ah 
a squeeze of lemon  a pinch of cinnamon 
and just a bit more sugar 
well  is it good 
ooh  it s too soon to tell 
we ll only really know once it s set 
designed by sir christopher wren 
st paul s cathedral is one
of london s most famous landmarks 
sadly the great dome
is closed to visitors today
as one of its statues was destroyed
in a bizarre accident last night 
  but if you follow me this way   
  excuse me  what happened here 
  a nun went berserk 
  really 
it happens 
the police have rounded them all up
for questioning 
hold it there  sister 
you re going nowhere
till the detective says so 
spin it around 
mind you  if you ask me 
the real culprit slipped the net 
what makes you say that 
cos i saw her  that s what 
i was on patrol in the upper dome 
watching the nuns parade far below 
  when something caught my eye 
one of them broke free from the herd 
and made her way
to the whispering gallery 
only the good lord knows
what she was doing up there 
c 
but she was never
gonna get away with it 
not while i m vice deputy head
of security 
oi 
attention all units 
an unusually attractive nun
is causing mayhem in the cathedral dome 
activate emergency protocol 
stop that stunning sister 
  i set off at lightning speed 
but by the time we d locked the place
down  she d vanished into the night 
  good evening  my son 
  oh  er  good evening  your grace 
good evening 
most beautiful woman i ve seen
in a lo o o ong time 
do you think you might be able
to describe her 
it would be my pleasure 
gentlemen  for breakfast this morning 
chef mcginty would like to propose
an orange marmalade   
   served on a bed
of warm crustless bread
topped with another piece
of warm    crustless bread 
bon appétit 
two choices  take it or leave it 
are you all right  knuckles 
yes 
why don t you come and join the others 
don t want to 
  are you scared what they might think 
  no 
what do they think  did they like it

my father always said
i d amount to nothing and he was right 
knuckles  knuckles

have you got anything else 
  what 
  you know  for  um    pudding

i m afraid we only know
how to make marmalade 
  hmm 
  but if you have any recipes   
this lot  you re wasting
your time there  paddington 
they wouldn t know
their pectin from their paprika 
well  my grandmother
used to do a lovely chocolate roulade 
i think i can remember the recipe 
ooh 
charley rumble
makes a mean apple crumble 
and i can make
a strawberry panna cotta   
   with a pomegranate glaze 
oh  i like the sound of that 
don t you  knuckles 
  yeah

let s get cooking 
  there you go  paddington 
  ooh  knuckles

well  then

wasn t such a monster after all 
and they all became the best of friends 
  the end 
  aww 
uh  time for bed  you lot 
  you need your beauty sleep 
it s visiting day tomorrow 
visiting day 
i do hope you have good news 
in the past month 
these three shadowy individuals
have all been seen
snooping around three london landmarks 
  oh 
  we think the thief you saw
 is part of a criminal gang 
  using the pop up book
 as a treasure map 
  well  it s a theory 
  have you found out who they are 
  not yet  dearie 
maybe i should take a look 
i m sorry 
this is a private conversation 
oh  it s all right  mr brown 
this is my friend  knuckles 
  how are you 
  this is phibs 
  g  day 
spoon 
  hello 
  jimmy the snitch 
  all right  
  t bone 
  wotcher

  double bass bob 
  hello 
  farmer jack 
  how do 
  mad dog 
  woof 
  johnny cashpoint 
  kerching 
  sir geoffrey willcot 
  i hope i can rely on your vote 
and charley rumble 
oh  it s so wonderful to meet you all 
i must say  it s a great relief
to know that paddington s already made
such sweet friends 
would you excuse us a moment 
  what are you doing 
  talking to the nice men 
nice men 
mary  we can t trust these people 
i mean  look at them 
talk about a rogues  gallery  hideous 
as for that bearded baboon in the
middle  he s hardly got two brain cells
 to rub together 
  we can still hear you  mr brown 
that was the light you turned off 
the microphone is on the other side 
it s got  microphone  written on it 
gentlemen 
if i have offended you in any way   
don t worry about it 
we re fond of the little fella 
and let s face it  if anyone
can recognise a criminal gang  it s us 
we d be grateful for any help 
  please 
  well  knuckles 
i m afraid i don t recognise
any of them  lads 
i m afraid i couldn t possibly comment 
sorry to say it  kid 
but your friends
are barking up the wrong tree 
a nun  a beefeater and a king 
sounds more like a fancy dress party
than a criminal gang 
then   
what are we going to do now 
oh 
  watch where you re going 
  so sorry  sorry 
sorry  i get grumpy
when i haven t had breakfast 
keys    keys  keys 
bottoms 
  turn left   
  you can t park here 
l m not parked  i m doing the bins 
you re not doing the bins  sunshine 
you re studying on council time 
l m gonna report you  and your hat 
  morning  miss kitts  colonel 
  oh  morning  mrs brown 
judy asked me to drop these off to you 
propaganda 
you are wasting your time
trying to peddle that rubbish 
everyone round here
knows it was your bear that done it 
and this street
is a far  far better place without him 
w hat 
oi  it s that mangy dog 
you are going to the pound  my son 
barking without a licence
in a built up area 
  give  em here 
  i ll ticket you 
i have to sell them under the counter
for obvious reasons 
but people are buying  em 
  really 
 lt s a bloomin  good read  hm 
made a few people round here think twice
about your young bear 
you just need to find that thief 
oh  we re trying 
don t suppose you know where he is 
do you  feathers 
he s behind you 
  sorry  what 
  coo eel
  mary 
  oh  hello  phoenix 
why don t you come on in 
i want to hear all about
the investigation  yeah 
mysterious things
have been happening all over town 
ch  yes 
strange characters turning up
at every landmark in that book 
  are they 
  i don t know 
perhaps it s just a coincidence 
henry says i let my imagination
get the better of me 
well  you re an artist  mary  like me 
our imaginations run free
like bison upon the plain 
but can i just say 
in this particular case 
i think dear old henry
might have a point 
  do you 
  but  i do have
a little bit of good news
that might turn your frown upside down 
  oh  yes 
  hlooksu 
fingers  fingers  fingers 
as though the funding may be
coming through for my one man show 
  oh  right 
 lt s an evening of monologue and song 
featuring some of
my better known characters 
would you like a little preview 
um   
picture this scene 
darkness  then suddenly  spotlight 
me    ping 
oh  mary  you look sad 
you don t like musicals 
no  no  no  no 
i suppose it just seems so unfair 
paddington s in prison and yet   
 life carries on 
  oh  i know 
it must be so hard to accept
that he won 
that man with the dazzling blue eyes 
i beg your pardon 
the man in the poster 
your wonderful drawing 
yes  but   
how do you know he had blue eyes 
  hm 
 lt s just a pencil sketch 
ooh 
well  i must have coloured him in 
  yeah 
  phoenix buchanan 
he s a master of disguise 
  she s gone mad 
  think about it  henry 
someone out there knows
about the kozlova fortune  right 
alleged fortune 
knuckles said we weren t looking
for a criminal gang 
  knuckles 
  because there was no gang 
  it was one man 
  feathers knew all along   
  feathers  who s feathers 
  hm 
  the parrot at the news stand 
  no   
can we just return to planet earth
for a moment 
phoenix buchanan is a highly respected 
award winning actor
and a member of our platinum club 
  he is not a petty thief 
  hang on a minute  henry   
but let s just assume i m wrong 
shall we 
  ok 
  and that the fortune teller 
 career criminal and parrot are right 
  mm 
may i remind you
that you don t actually have any proof 
  er   
  now  if anyone wants me 
i shall be putting up posters 
he s right 
well  i believe you  mary 
actors are some of the most evil 
devious people on the planet 
  are they 
  they lie for a living 
crikey 
  if we re gonna catch one   
  yes 
   we re gonna need a foolproof plan 
oh 
 bamfing on pipe 
  paddington 
  oh 
paddington 
knuckles 
got a proposition for you  kid 
me and the boys have been talking
and seems to us 
if you re gonna clear your name 
you re gonna need our help 
the browns may mean well but   
  it takes a thief to catch a thief 
  ohh 
now  if we could figure a way
out of here and hit the streets 
we d find this guy soon enough 
but that would mean    escape 
it certainly would  and we got a plan 
but it s a four man job
so we need your help 
what do you say  kid 
it s very kind of you  knuckles  but   
i don t think aunt lucy
would like the idea of us   
breaking out of prison 
the browns will find the real thief 
i just need to be patient 
you may not wanna hear this  kid 
but sooner or later  the browns  well   
they ll forget you 
they always do 
they ll miss one visit 
then two 
before you know it 
you won t have a home to go back to 
you re wrong  knuckles 
you re all wrong 
the browns aren t like that 
they ll come tomorrow
and they ll have good news 
you ll see 
hello 
it s judy brown
from the portobello express 
come in 
so what s this for  darlings 
  school newspaper 
  yes 
we thought the agent of the phoenix
buchanan would be really interesting 
and you d be right 
but i ve got two minutes 
so we better make it snappy 
and i ve only given you that
because you ve brought breakfast 
nice buns  by the way 
here he comes

mr buchanan back on stage 
phoenix  oh 
i wouldn t hold your breath  darling 
no  no  no  don t get me wrong 
he s a terrific actor 
  but there is a teensy little problem 
  really

miss fanshaw

that s where you re wrong 
he owes money all over town  look 
so he s got a few bills 
i mean  everyone   
good grief

  hold your nerve  macbeth 
screw your courage to the
sticking place  we are so nearly there 
i have followed this lady
through the whole of london
and collected every one
of her clever little clues 
aye  but what do they mean 
it s just a jumble of letters  ain t it 
au contraire  mon ami 
uh uh  they are not letters at all 
  they are    musical notes 
  indeed  poirot 
and i believe i know
just where to play them 
hold it 
that is an amazing story 
but all you can actually prove
is that phoenix buchanan
keeps his old costumes 
bring me some hard evidence 
bring me the book with his fingerprints
on and then you ve got a case 
but until then 
there s nothing i can do 
 l m sorry 
  what 
where she s    where s she going 
  what do we do now 
  i don t know 
well  at least we can tell paddington

i didn t really mean to but   
knuckles said that if we broke out

   gooddye 
 phone rings 
  oh  hello

oh  we d never forget you  paddington 
  paddington 
  you re family 
we know who the thief was 
  it s phoenix buchanan 
  mr buchanan 
but he s disappeared into thin air 
we ve been looking for him
at every landmark in that book 
every last page 
 where all your dreams come true  
why do you say that 
oh  it was written on the last page
of the pop up book 
  always made me think of aunt lucy 
  that s very bizarre 
ls it 
i found that exact same phrase on
a scrap of paper in phoenix s house 
  really 
  l m sure i ve seen that before 
look 
   where all your dreams come true  
  the organ 
that must be where
madame kozlova hid her fortune 
  let s get to the fair 
 lt s too late  they re leaving today 
  from paddington station 
  at 6 35 
  there s still time 
  paddington  head for the station 
if we can find phoenix
and get hold of that book 
his fingerprints will prove everything 
but that s miles away  mr brown  i   
i ll see you there 
clear the road 
this is a refuse emergency 
sorry 
fellow citizens 
i ve just received intelligence 
the bear has escaped
and may be heading this way 
i have raised the neighbourhood
panic level to  wild hysteria  
get out of the way  mr curry 
paddington s not coming this way 
he s gonna clear his name 
  and we re gonna bring him home 
  we don t want him here 
no  of course you don t  you never have 
as soon as you set eyes on that bear 
you made up your mind about him 
well  paddington s not like that 
he looks for the good in all of us
and somehow  he finds it 
it s why he makes friends
wherever he goes 
and it s why windsor gardens
is a happier place whenever he s around 
he wouldn t hesitate
if any of us needed help 
so stand aside  mr curry 
cos we re coming through 
nice try  brown 
your plan seems to have stalled 
like your vehicle 
try the choke  go on  try the choke 
you re flooding it 
  clutch down  second gear  mr brown 
  what 
  what you doing 
after three 
  what s going on

the police realised
they made a terrible mistake

  you re a free bear 
  how long have i been asleep 
  three days 
three days  but that means   
 lt s aunt lucy s birthday 
  and i never sent her anything 
 it s all right  paddington 
  but it isn t all right  mrs brown 
you see  aunt lucy did so much for me
when i was a cub 
without her 
i d never have come to london 
and  i suppose all i ever really wanted
was to make her proud 
but now she s going to wake up
on her birthday with no present
and think i ve let her down completely 
oh  you great goose

  we wanted to say thank you 
  thank you 
  for everything you ve done for us 
  yes 
if it wasn t for you 
we d never have met 
you helped me pass my exam 
i would be permanently
locked out of my house 
i d say you ve rather a lot
to be proud of 
oh 
when we heard the police
wanted the popping book for evidence 
we thought we d find aunt lucy
another present 
so we all clubbed together 
i pulled in a few favours
from my old air force chums 
and we think she s going to love it 
but    what is it 
you wanted to get that book so
aunt lucy could see london  didn t you 
it was always her dream 
well  we thought 
why look at london in a book
when she could see the real thing 
why don t you go and answer that 
oh 
oh 
paddington 
happy birthday  aunt lucy

well  it seems i didn t need
