the keeper
of the lmperial seal  
just the man l was looking for 
a woman

very progressive 
a gift from an old friend  
wu chow 
he wanted me to send
his regards 
father 
  gasps

  chuckles  
what are you reading 
oh  
  roy o bannon vs  the mummy   
lt s incredible 
roy s just taken out
the mummy s entire army
of zombie confederate soldiers 
and he only had one bullet 
that s impossible 
oh   no  it s not 
roy figured out
the physics of the canyon
and then ricocheted a bullet
off the canyon wall  
nailed each zombie
through the heart 
what about the shanghai kid 
he was captured
and knocked out on page 1 0
while he was polishing
roy s pearl handles 
don t you worry 
roy s about to save him from
becoming a human sacrifice 
those stories are all lies 
no  see 
lt says right here
on the back 
  author sage mccallister bases
all his stories
on firsthand accounts   
  horse whinnying  
sorry  sheriff 
no princess 
every day you meet
the noon stage 
every day it s the same story 
she s not coming back 
pei pei s married to her work
in san francisco 
modern woman  
sheriff  you got a parcel  
hey  maybe it s from her 
no  lt s from my sister
in china 
  horse neighs  
l know

stay here and be a good horsey
for the new sheriff 
uh   sheriff 
that stage is headed east 
lsn t china kind of west

roy invested my money 
ls it true that he lives in a
penthouse at the top of the ritz
surrounded by dozens
of beautiful women
at his every beck and call 
that s the old roy 
he s married   settled down  
trust me  he s changed  
  women laughing  
so there we were 
completely outnumbered  
he didn t have to tell me
we didn t stand a chance 
so l send the shanghai kid
and the princess out the back 
poor shanghai kid  
he was so frightened  
he forgot to thank me
for saving his life 
l m used to that 
now  l returned to the front 
and l counted to three       
and l burst out of the mission  
pearl handles blazing  
lead flying everywhere 
and not a single bullet
touched me 
 no 
 yeah  
what happened
to the emperor s gold 
well   we divided it up 
l insisted on giving my share
to the lndians 
the savages 
please don t ever call
those noble people savages 
lf being proud of your body
and wanting to ride around naked
all day makes you a savage 
then   by god  
you re drinking with a savage 
  slurping   laughing  
and that is what you call
a french toast

was he an lmperial guard 
no 
much more important 
he was the keeper
of the lmperial seal  
that s what l love
about china 
everybody s job description
sounds so damn cool  
the seal has been symbol
of the emperor s power
since genghis khan  
lt has been passed down
from one emperor to another 
my family have been watching
over it for 1 2 generations 
1 2 generations 
my father and l used to
skip stones across the moat
and talk about a day
l would follow his footsteps 
l was his only son  
lf l d have been there 
l could have protected him  
lt s not your fault 
you were 3 000 miles away 
what s with that little box 
my sister sent it to me
from my father 
 there s a message inside

so you can see what it says 
l must have patience 
by the time

the little punk better not
have scuffed it 
 l hope your luck picks up 
 what do you mean 
l deduced from your watch
that you d hit a rough patch  
he has 
how do you know 
lt s an investigative technique
l ve developed  
l can deduce intimate details
about an individual
through a close scrutiny
of their personal effects 
what else can you tell 
the owner of this watch
is a bad gambler
and a lousy shot 
although he s cheated death
several times       
he spends most of his life
wandering in a rather pathetic
and futile search
for purpose and respect 
oh   yes 
he has a penchant
for loose women  
wow  that s amazing  
l m sure it s a very popular
party trick
at birthdays
for small children        
but it doesn t quite play
with adults 
just to set
the record straight 
roy o bannon is not attracted
to loose women  
loose women
are attracted to me 
 you re roy o bannon 
 yeah  
the famous western folk hero 
have you heard of me 
have l heard of you

why are you in jail 
l followed the man
who murdered father 
and

and tried to kill him  
lt s my duty to find
father s killer 
no  it is mine

to the throne       
her majesty s
favorite cousin        
and the finest swordsman
in england  
so  of course 
the press had a field day 
the story actually knocked jack
the ripper off the front page 
artie  lin is not a killer 
she s just a really 
really  really hot       
confused chinese girl  
maybe if l agreed to sign
a few autographs
and talk to some of my fans
here in england        
do some type of charity event 
can we get her out that way 
l m afraid
that s out of the question  
what will happen
to my sister 
she ll go to trial  
probably be locked away
in an institution
for the criminally insane 
the tabloids have already
dubbed her   loony lin    
l thought it was rather catchy 
at the time 
  exhales sharply  
do you have any notion
what would happen
if we were to be seen
together 
since your return   l have yet to
lay eyes on the lmperial seal
