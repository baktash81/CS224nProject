that youd hit a rough patch
he has
how do you know
lts an investigative technique
lve developed
l can deduce intimate details
about an individual
through a close scrutiny
of their personal effects
what else can you tell
the owner of this watch
is a bad gambler
and a lousy shot
although hes cheated death
several times
he spends most of his life
wandering in a rather pathetic
and futile search
for purpose and respect
oh  yes
he has a penchant
for loose women
wow thats amazing
lm sure its a very popular
party trick
at birthdays
for small children
but it doesnt quite play
with adults
just to set
the record straight
roy obannon is not attracted
to loose women
loose women
are attracted to me
youre roy obannon
yeah
the famous western folk hero
have you heard of me
have l heard of you
lve only read roy obannon
vs the mummy five times

so of course
the press had a field day
the story actually knocked jack
the ripper off the front page
artie lin is not a killer
shes just a really
really really hot
confused chinese girl
maybe if l agreed to sign
a few autographs
and talk to some of my fans
here in england
