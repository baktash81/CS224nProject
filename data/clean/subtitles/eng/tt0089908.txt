  what  precious 
i wish i could put my head on my paws
and go to sleep like toto 
soon you will 
i just can t see payin  out money
for this doctor when we don t have any 
garnet said she d loan it to us 
garnet  that s charity  em 
she s my sister 
it s family  not charity 
it s been six months since the tornado 
and dorothy hasn t been herself since 
i m takin  her to cottonwood falls
tomorrow and see if she can be helped 
all she ever talks about
is someplace that just doesn t exist 
talkin  tin men  walkin  scarecrows 
ruby slippers 
a shooting star  toto 
a shooting star 
toto  no  no  toto 
did you lay an egg
this morning  billina 
let s go see 
where s your egg  billina 
billina  if you don t start
laying again 
aunt em says she s gonna
stew you up for supper 
it s a key  toto 
 o    z  
oz 
aunt em 
aunt em  look  a key from oz 
it s just a key to the old house
before the tornado 
  i must ve turned it a thousand times 
  no  look  aunt em 
it s proof   o z   oz 
  dorothy   
  my friends sent it on a shooting star 
remember how we spoke 
not to talk about oz 
why 
 cause it s just my imagination 
i know you don t want
to go to the doctor s 
but you just haven t slept the night
right through since the tornado 
and then  you re no help
to me in the morning 
aunt em  my friends are in trouble 
  i know it 
  we are in trouble  dorothy 
lost the old house in the tornado 
never before had to have a mortgage 
now we may have to have two 
winter s comin  on 
new house isn t finished 
he broke his leg  aunt em 
dorothy  that leg s mended  it s mended 
hurry up and get yourself ready 
we re going to be late 
bye  uncle henry 
y all get yourselves back here by dark 
we will 
come on  giddap  there you go 
go home  toto 
toto  go home 
go home 
aunt em  will he be all right 
he will 
go home 
giddap 
i ve never been past franklin before 
the tin woodsman used to be made
of flesh  like everybody else 
but then he cut off his leg 
he had a tin leg made 
but then a witch enchanted his ax 
and he kept on cutting off the other parts
of his body  until he was all made of tin 
  even his head was   
  that s all right  dorothy 
you mentioned something about a tiger 
a lion  a cowardly lion 
and he could talk too 
like the scarecrow and the tin man 
yes  all the animals in oz could talk 
just how did you get back from oz 
with my ruby slippers 
and exactly   
how did that work 
you put them on
and you click the heels three times 
and then you said 
 there s no place like home  
dorothy  where are those slippers now 
dorothy 
i lost them 
they fell off on the way back 
well  i think i know just the thing
to cheer dorothy up 
this electrical marvel will make
it possible for you to sleep again 
and it will also get rid of
all those bad waking dreams
that you ve been telling me about 
now  this fellow here has a face 
do you see it 
here are his eyes 
and this must be his nose 
and this must be his mouth 
but what s this  dorothy 
why  it s his tongue 
isn t it 
  will it hurt 
  no  no 
it just manages electrical current 
now  your aunt already knows
that we are at the dawn of a new age 
in just two months 
it will be the year 1900 
a new century  the 20th century 
a century of electricity 
the brain itself is an electrical machine 
it s nothing but a machine 
when it malfunctions 
a blow to the head  for example 
then the brain produces
useless excess currents 
these excess currents
are our dreams and delusions 
and we have found out that
sometimes the brain malfunctions 
just like the dreams
that you have  dorothy 
now we have the means
to control these excess currents 
yes 
fine 
i must get back to henry
before nightfall 
you understand  don t you 
here s your lunch pail  i was thinking
we d only stay a short time 
that won t be necessary 
we have excellent meals here 
now  be a good girl 
and do everything the doctor
and the head nurse tell you 
and i ll be back tomorrow
and we ll go home 
i ve never left her
out of my sight among strangers 
she s in good hands 
will you bring toto
when you come to get me 
i will  yes  of course i will 
you won t need that 
you stay here until
we come and get you 
you may have a nap if you wish 
come on  giddap 
come on 
aunt em 
this is for you 
thank you 
  it s halloween soon 
  i know 
why did they bring you here  dorothy 
because i can t sleep 
and i talk about a place that i ve been to 
but nobody believes it exists 
i have to go  i ll come back later 
would you like to go
for a ride  dorothy 
  lie down 
  i d like to sit up if i may 
  what did your aunt tell you 
  to do what you told me  miss wilson 
then lie down 
why do you have to tie me down 
so that you don t fall off 
i came all the way from the farm
in the buggy and didn t fall off 
  did i hear somebody screaming there 
  no 
hello  dorothy  how are you 
i wish i wasn t tied down 
nothing to worry about 
what are those 
oh 
we ll just put them over your ears 
pretty soon they ll draw all those
unpleasant dreams out of your head 
then  when you wake up 
you ll never be bothered by them again 
testing  on 
off 
well  i think we re almost ready 
  ready 
  yes  doctor 
oh  dear 
i ll see to that 
you check the generator 
  who s there 
  quick  we have to get you out of here 
what s that screaming 
patients who have been damaged 
locked in the cellar 
quick

i ve never been so wet in my whole life 
how big is this pond anyway 
i don t think it s a pond  billina 
  i guess it is a pond 
  told you so 
where did all the rest of the water go 
where did kansas go 
this is some place for a chicken coop 
when did you learn to talk  i thought
hens could only cluck and cackle 
strange  ain t it  how s my grammar 
if we were in the land of oz 
your talking wouldn t be strange at all 
there goes the water 
high and dry 
oz 
  maybe this is oz 
  oz 
well  i think i ll have a look around and
see if i can find myself some breakfast 
wait 
if this is the land of oz 
then this is the deadly desert 
deadly desert 
it surrounds oz  last time
i flew over it in the old house 
anything living that touches it
turns to sand 
just my luck 
if we stay on these stones 
we ll be all right 
careful 
careful 
one  two  three 
there 
  now  let s find something for breakfast 
  it s about time 
then we can go on to the emerald city

and in there was the kitchen

the wicked witch of the east 
  wicked witch 
  but where are all the munchkins 
what are you on about  my dear

the yellow brick road
and are on their way
to the emerald city

  they ve all been turned to stone 
all this way to see a bunch of stiffs

wind number one under left arm 
 for speaking 
wind number two under right arm 
 for walking and action

his majesty  the scarecrow  locked me
in here and told me to wait for you 
what happened to the emerald city 
where is the scarecrow 
i do not know  suddenly everything
living began to turn to stone 
when you did not arrive 
i called for help until my voice ran down 
then i paced back and forth
until my action ran down 
then i stood and thought
until my thought ran down 
after that  i remember nothing
until you wound me up  thank you 
you re welcome 
it was billina who found the key 
  billina 
  over here 
good morning  mrs  hen  where
did you find the key for this place 
  over near the hog trough

sent it to you somehow 
if you don t mind  mr  tok 
i ll wind up your action 
that would please me very much 
and you may call me tik tok 
why weren t you turned to stone
just like everybody else 
because i am not alive
and never will be  thank goodness 
well  tik tok  the first thing we have
to do is to escape from the wheelers 
they re outside  and said they re going
to throw us into the deadly desert 
from now on  i will be
your obedient servant 
if you keep me wound up 
make sure my think works are
extra tight  and i will formulate a plan 
lunch pail 
these wheelers can be tricky customers 
oh  my goodness 
you run up the stairs 
i will take care of them 
come here 
you ll be sorry for treating me like this 
i m a terrible person 
i am only a machine  so i cannot be sorry
or happy  no matter what happens 
where s the scarecrow 
what s happened to the emerald city 
answer her 
  answer her 
  the nome king 
he conquered the emerald city 
he took all the emeralds 
  he turned everyone to stone 
  what about the scarecrow

that knows where the scarecrow is 
and that s princess m    m    mom

the nome king took the scarecrow and
all the emeralds back to his mountain 
and turned everyone else to stone

i ve been alive such a short while 
and i m afraid of spoiling
before i ve seen anything of the world 
could you put some of the rest of me
together again 
if you can just tie that arm on 
and then  my other leg
has fallen off too 
are you sure you re not my mom 
i m sure  jack 
well  my mother built me to scare
that awful witch  mombi 
she stood me in a place where
mombi would meet me  face to face 
and along she came 
sure enough  she was scared 
but then  she was angry 
she has a terrible temper 
i know 
where did she get
all those different heads 
did you see the headless
dancing girls outside 
well  that s where she got them 
anyway  mombi was about
to destroy me with her stick 
but she decided to test some powder
of life she d just bought from a magician 
she did 
it worked 
here i am 
powder of life 
you sprinkle it on something
and the thing comes to life 
does mombi have any more of it 
if she does  it s in cabinet 31 
with her original head 
what happened to your mother 
she vanished  mombi enchanted her 
after that  she threw me in this corner
and said she was gonna make
a pie out of me 
but she was wearing head 22 at the time
and must not have worn it since 
because she hasn t remembered
i m up here

  well  hurry 
thank goodness  dorothy 
i am all right now 
go to the door and look out for mombi 
all right  dorothy 
make sure you do the head

the last thing i remember
is walking through the forest
and hearing a loud noise 
and now  here i am 
flying through the air 
what am i anyway 
you re just a thing
with a gump s head on it 
we built you and brought you to life
so that you could take us to
the nome king to rescue the scarecrow 
i may not last very long 
i don t feel too well put together 
oh  don t say that 
how do we know where to land 
it s awful dark down there 
the nome king s mountain
was straight ahead 
i think 
the best thing to do is
to keep flying until dawn 
then maybe we can find
a safe place to land 
good idea  tik tok 
mr  gump  can you just
keep flying straight ahead 
i don t think
i could turn if i wanted to 
why don t we just fly back to kansas 
whatever happens 
i m awfully sleepy right now 
and i m just glad i have
my own head to be sleepy with 
good night  mom 
good night  jack 
ozma 
nobody s going to help you 
nobody knows where you are 
there s nobody left
who even knows who you are 
  what are they 
  wheelers 
mr  gump  can t you fly any faster 
not unless one of you wants to jump off 
oh 
tik tok  you re the heaviest 
hmph 
deadly desert 
deadly desert 
we are over the deadly desert  jack 
mom  wake up 
what s happening

oh  thank you  dorothy 
jack  are you all right 
why are all of you
standing on your heads 
where are we  anyway 
the nome king s mountain 
the nome king 
oh  thank you  dorothy 
tik tok  you ve got to be more careful 
yes  your majesty  you called 
what is that noise going on up there 
i don t know  your majesty 
well  find out 
what about the gump  he s all in pieces 
and good riddance 
i m much happier just being a head 
we should tie him back on the sofa 
then  at least  he could walk 
oh  no 
every head must have a body
if it expects to get around 
doesn t look like there s much
of anyplace to get around to 
she escaped from mombi somehow
and crossed the deadly desert 
now she is on our mountain
with a small army 
she is more powerful than i thought 
what about the chicken 
there s no sign of the chicken 
this is terrible 
suppose i meet another gump 
i d die a second time  of embarrassment 
i don t think you ll have to worry about
meeting any other gumps up here 
tell me who you are 
and why you have come
all the way to my kingdom
and what i can do to make you happy 
  it must be the nome king 
  where is he  i don t see anybody 
my name is dorothy gale  your majesty 
and these are my friends 
tik tok  jack and the gump 
not the dorothy gale from kansas 
yes  your majesty 
we ve come to ask you to release the
scarecrow and restore the emerald city 
you believe that i have
stolen something  dorothy 
and you want me to give it back 
yes  your majesty 
if someone steals something 
you think they should give it back 
yes  your majesty 
and what if they don t
want to give it back 
well 
then we are here
with our army to conquer you
and force you to give it back 
army 
mom  why is he laughing 
army 
an army 
  look out 
  i am  i am 
  dorothy 
  mom 
all the precious stones in the world
are made here
in my underground dominions 
all made for me
by my nomes 
so  imagine how we feel
when someone from the world above
digs down and steals my treasures 
all those emeralds in the emerald city
really belong to me 
i was just taking back
what was mine to begin with 
  you have so much 
  beg your pardon 
you have so much 
that is not the point 
i am not the thief 
  dorothy 
  scarecrow 
your friend is the thief 
what s happened to the scarecrow 
oh  i transformed him into an ornament 
into an amusing and beautiful ornament
for my palace 
i had been planning
to do it for some time 
and your coming here
reminded me 
thank you 
he never stole anything 
they were there when he came 
he never stole the emeralds 
they were there when he came 
he   
the emeralds    he never stole 
no  no  don t cry 
poor  poor dorothy gale from kansas 
i didn t realize
he meant so much to you 
he didn t steal the emeralds  they
were there when he became king 
all s not lost  dorothy 
i know just the thing to cheer you up 
you and your friends
can play a little game 
and i bet that you get
the scarecrow back after all 
you d risk something for that 
wouldn t you 
all right  then  where s dorothy 
where s the chicken 
  they escaped 
  they went that way 
she went into the nome king s mountain 
we have to warn him about that chicken 
take me to the nome king 
you stupid idiots 
you can go and inspect
my ornament collection 
each of you has three chances
to guess which one is the scarecrow 
if you touch the right object
and say the word  oz  at the same time 
the scarecrow will be restored
and you may leave the palace 
sound fair enough 
what else can we do 
he s a very powerful magician 
we re lucky
he hasn t turned us to stone 
all right  we accept 
oh  good 
why doesn t the sofa go first 
but i don t have anything to touch with 
you can use your antlers 
i should ve quit when i was ahead 
good luck  mr  gump 
shall we have some refreshment
while we wait 
  how is it 
  good 
what is it 
limestone pie
and hot melted silver 
melted silver 
the king mentioned a risk 
what is it that we are risking 
what was that 
next 
  pick me up 
  i m coming  tik tok 
pick me up  pick me up 
  thank you 
  where s the gump 
  he s turned into an ornament 
  what do you mean 
an ornament  a knickknack 
he failed to guess correctly 
and so now he s become
part of my collection 
  oh  no 
  but that s not fair 
you said you were willing
to take a risk 
it sounds fair to me 
and what i think is all that matters 
but you didn t tell us about it 
well  you didn t ask 
perhaps you d like to visit
my fiery furnace 
next 
  pumpkinhead 
  me 
being an ornament will probably be
hardest on you  dorothy 
since you re used to eating and
sleeping and other such activities 
since i never eat or sleep 
i won t miss them 
don t talk that way  jack 
we won t become ornaments 
tik tok s not even alive 
i have always valued my lifelessness 
be careful  jack 
you too  billina 
we re a long way from kansas  dorothy 
faster  faster 
faster  faster  faster 
you hear me  faster  faster 
you miserable  slow wretches 
i do not hold out much hope for jack 
he has many excellent qualities 
but thinking is not one of them 
maybe he ll be lucky 
two guesses left 
  you need winding 
  my think works could be tighter 
it s too bad they didn t make you
so you could wind yourself up 
half the trouble you get into
comes from winding down 
faster  faster 
faster 
next  the army of oz 
do not worry  dorothy 
i am going to guess correctly 
why did you come here 
i told you why 
you came all this way for a scarecrow 
are you sure you didn t
come back for these 
  my ruby slippers 
  no  no 
no  my ruby slippers 
they just fell out of the sky one day 
you were so anxious to get home 
they re very powerful 
they made it possible for me
to conquer the emerald city 
thank you 
the army of oz has stopped guessing
and is standing perfectly still
in the middle of the room 
your army
has stopped guessing
and is standing perfectly still
in the middle of the room 
his action must have run down 
i wound up his thought 
but i forgot to do his action 
why don t you go in and wind him up 
then you can stay in
and guess for yourself 
dorothy 
you don t have to go down there 
i can use the ruby slippers
and send you home 
and when you get back 
you will never think of oz again 
what about my friends 
forget about them 
you can t help them now 
there s no place like home 
tik tok 
tik tok  tik tok 
tik tok  you re all wound up 
what s the matter  why did you stop 
it was my way of getting you in here 
pretend that you are
winding me up anyway 
i have an idea that may save us 
i have one guess left 
and if i guess incorrectly 
you can watch and see
what i am changed into 
that may give you a clue 
what a good idea 
my steel brains must be damaged
because i am having difficulty guessing 
tik tok 
don t cry 
ready 
oz 
tik tok 
tik tok 
dorothy gale  you re all that s left 
stop 
open up  tell him it s important 
oz 
kneel 
lower 
lower 
oz 
one guess left 
dorothy gale has come back 
yes  i know  you were supposed
to bring her to me 
she stole my ruby key  my powder of life
and valuable antiques which
she made into a flying sofa 
and she s headed this way 
you know 
i know everything 
she s already here 
but not for much longer 
why didn t you just
transform them all right away 
it s more fun this way 
but if she guesses right
and finds out about ozma   
ozma 
you haven t let her escape as well 
no  no 
then there s nothing to worry about 
soon there ll be no one left
who remembers oz 
and i will be completely human 
oz 
dorothy 
smudge and blazes 
  scarecrow 
  dorothy 
  you were green 
  what 
  you were a green ornament 
  i was 
maybe people from oz
turn into green ornaments 
fumes and furnaces 
green  green  green  green 
green  it s green 
you let her escape 
it s green  dorothy  green 
oz 
oh  it s you  the gump 
petrified polymorphs 
look for green ornaments  quick 
we ve still got tik tok  jack
and billina to find 
you had her and you let her escape 
it wasn t my fault 
if you d given me a real army   
i ll take care of you later 
what  oh  no

i wish all of us from oz
to return there safely 
and for the emerald city and all
the people in it to be restored to life 
i must say  this life is stranger
than my last one 
where s tik tok 
we never found him 
  oh  no 
  where d you get that 
there s a medal on your antler 
that must ve come
from the ornament collection 
go on  touch it  dorothy 
oz 
oh  dorothy  my thinking
must have completely run down 
i do not remember
leaving the nome kingdom 
everything s all right now 
hi  hi 
be the queen of oz  dorothy 
be the queen of oz 
  be the queen of oz 
  the queen of oz 
the queen of oz 
be the queen of oz 
you re the best friends
anyone s ever had 
i ve got to go back 
we understand  dorothy 
do you 
i wish i could be in both places
at the same time 
look  behind you  in the mirror 
it s you 
i was afraid you had drowned 
help me step through
the glass  dorothy 
you re so beautiful 
  what s your name 
  ozma 
mom  my real mom 
she is ozma 
queen and rightful ruler of oz 
her father was king of oz
before the wizard came 
ozma grew up as mombi s slave 
when the nome king promised mombi
30 beautiful heads
if she kept ozma a secret 
she enchanted her into the mirror 
i forgive mombi 
dorothy has punished her
by removing her magical powers 
and a witch with no magic
is a miserable creature indeed 
and that s a fact 
now  please  wish me back to kansas 
on one condition 
i will look in on you from time to time 
and if you ever wish to return to oz 
i will make it so 
goodbye  dorothy 
you re not coming back  billina 
no  not to that stupid 
humdrum world again 
goodbye  dorothy 
oh  no  i mean  i didn t
expect to go so soon 
i haven t really said goodbye yet 
goodbye  cowardly lion 
  goodbye  dorothy 
  tik tok 
  goodbye 
  goodbye  dorothy

give my love to all the chickens
