dont believe going mission totally blindfolded mr jones
film came camera
mounted russian satellite belong russia
thats delicate point camera
developed bad engineering
took three years develop roundtheclock work
cant duplicated two years certain processes grinding lenses
incredible piece machinery
got focal length
photograph packet cigarettes miles space
tiny negative capable infinite enlargement
see american lads came new film emulsion
hushhush times sensitive
anything previously available
negative miraculously developed within satellite
put film camera hell box brownie
russians lent fellows lost
lost hijacked broad daylight
dismantled smuggled havana

russians put camera made german scientists
film made german scientists
satellite made german scientists
thus went round round whizzing us seven times day
photographing missile bases within hours pictures
every missile base north america
every time camera took picture another one took fix stars
could check coordinates aim missiles launching pads
film
irony still
zebra
somewhere
way find get
russians ran little trouble thats encouraging
initially academic seemed
satellite orbiting north america western russia siberia
darling little camera went right
taking pictures wasnt supposed
beautiful pictures russian installations
makes piece film dangerous
desirable
bit information world
ran real trouble see orbiting like
fired retros comedown siberia
one rockets misfired instead slowing satellite
swung new orbit pole pole
thats embarrassing russians ninetenths
water free world
none soviet union sphere communist influence
thats lights began burn kremlin
although orbit radically changed satellite aborted
still sufficient control bring reentry
pickup ocean would involve whole naval operation wed know
land expedition would even worse
asked us
hoping didnt know existed
calculated days determine point reentry
beyond satellite would slow reenter accord
burn atmosphere
consider dilemma arctic antarctic
antarctic busy scientific expeditions
us great britain netherlands chile
france australia new zealand russia
russia sent vaslov sniff case

dr ra goodwin appeared applied permission
research university professor impeccable qualifications
immediately accepted flown next day
knew agent ever since became impeccable
knew exactly would drop satellite
three men impeccable qualifications came next day
day flight
goodwin didnt suspect difference make
sent reinforcements wed send
hed escalate wed escalate soon somebody pushes button
strict code ethics game captain
usually know cards man holds
always keep aces sleeves
russians positioned satellite reentry
