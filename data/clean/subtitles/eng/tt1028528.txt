we can t be late 
we won t 
  who s holding 
  if you re not  then nobody 
we were kind of hoping you were 
  yeah  how are you not holding 
  jesus christ  shanna 
it is not my fucking job to supply 
y all with weed when we go out 
whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  little lady 
you re getting angry kind of quick 
don t you think 
  i was just teasing you 
  i m not angry 
it just would be nice if y all didn t
just count on me all the fucking time 
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot 
okay  mean girl in a high school movie 
are you through having a tantrum 
  i m not having a tantrum 
  yes  you are 
you ve been in the car all of two seconds 
and you re already cursing at me 
  i am not cursing at you 
  you said   jesus christ  shanna  
and then 
before the sentence was over 
you threw a  fucking  in there
to emphasize your  irritatance  
all right  come on  guys  don t fight 
i ll pay for it when we get some 
one  it is not about the money 
it is about the pain in the ass of scoring 
and two  we re not really fighting 
arlene  have you forgotten
what hanging out with jungle julia s like 
that wasn t a fight 
that was julia
acting like a grumpy bitch 
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time 
that s how we tolerate each other
after all these years 
oh  billboard 
so  what s the plan  man 
margaritas and mexican food at guero s 
did you call rafael
and tell him we re coming 
  of course 
  you re so good 
i know 
okay  is christian simonson
gonna be there 
you bet your ass he is 
he s gonna be there with jesse letterman 
christian simonson 
the filmmaker  is in town 
he s got a big thing for julia 
if he had a big thing for me 
he d fucking call me
as opposed to disappearing
for six months 
and he d get his ass down here
more often than he does 
and on my birthday 
give me a fucking phone call 
oh  billboard 
yeah  but you get those legs
of yours around him  and it s all over 
yeah  well  when i m redecorating
his house in the hills
that i am also living in 
i ll let you know it worked 
so  margaritas and mexican food at guero s 
touch base with chris and jesse 
tell them about later 
and make damn sure they come 
those other guys will be waiting for us
to join them at the texas chili parlor 
oh  shit 
speaking of which  what happened
with you and nate last night 
well  you know  not mu   
we just fucking met each other 
i mean  if you don t bust their balls a
little bit  they re never gonna respect you 
okay  we re pretty clear
on what it is you didn t do 
how about enlightening us
on what it is you did do 
nothing to write home about 
we just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes 
dressed  half dressed or naked 
dressed  i said we made out 
we didn t do the thing 
excuse me for living 
but what is  the thing  
you know  it s everything but 
they call it  the thing  
i call it  the thing  
do guys like the thing 
they like it better than no thing 
okay  i wanna get back
to what it is you did do 
so  you re making out
on the couch with nate  right 
  correct 
  whose couch 
  his or the one in your hotel room 
  what am i  stupid over here  mine 
were you making out
sitting up or lying down 
we started sitting up 
we worked our way to lying down 
mmm  the plot thickens 
who was on top 
i was straddling him 
  what else 
  that was it 
so we made out
for a little while on the couch 
and i said   okay  i m gonna go to bed now 
so it s time for you to leave  
and then he starts to whine 
 oh  right now  
and i said   yep  right now 
let s go  
and he says 
 well  wait  what about this  
and i said   no  
he said   what do you mean  no 
you don t even know what i m gonna say  
i said   i already know
what you re gonna say 
and the answer s no  
he said   how can you say
you know what i m gonna say  
i said   because you re gonna say 
 let s just go to sleep together 
  we don t gotta do nothing 
  just cuddle  sleep next to each other 
wake up in the morning together  
no  you re gonna leave 
but i ll see you tomorrow  
yeah  fuck nate 
i mean  he s cute and all 
but jesse letterman s
gonna be all over her 
  jesse letterman   
  remember  no hooking up tonight 
you can hang out with him 
you can make out with him 
but no hooking up with him 
because we are driving to lake lbj tonight 
and my daddy s pretty clear
about one thing 
he said   i am letting you
and your girlfriends stay at my lake house 
not you and a bunch of horny boys trying
to get their fuck on with my daughter  
  your dad talks like that 
  hell  yeah 
it s not like he ain t gonna know  either 
because when i m staying at the lake house
with my girlfriends in our bikinis 
daddy just has a tendency to pop up
and make sure we don t need anything 
look  he s totally harmless
and cute as a bug s ear 
but  you know  when he s got
a bunch of half naked poontang
walking the floor of his lake house 
he just likes to pay us a visit
and make sure we got everything we need 
and if you flirt shamelessly with him  like
the six foot baby giraffe in the backseat 
you got a puppy dog for life 
i have my own relationship
with ben 
and you re just jealous
 cause it don t include you 
  you call her dad ben 
  i m not a child  that s his name 
so when are the boys showing up 
they re gonna meet us
at the chili parlor 
maybe they can bring some pot 
fuck that  no 
i don t wanna be either
a  depending on their fucking ass 
or b  depending on their ass 
uh uh  we don t score ourselves 
we re gonna be stuck
with them all fucking night 
ooh  try lanna frank 
best idea you had all day 
oh  hey  that s your last billboard
before guero s 
oh  come on 
give me a break

 the woods are lovely 
dark and deep 
 and i have promises to keep

miles to go before you sleep  
and then  if they say that    
you gotta give them a lap dance 
what 
if they call you butterfly 
buy you a drink 
repeat that poem 
you gotta give them a lap dance 
that s bullshit 
i ain t giving them nothing 
well  you can do it or not 
but if you don t 
everybody in austin s
gonna think you re a chickenshit 
and i don t think you want everybody
in austin thinking you re a chickenshit 
i ain t giving nobody no lap dance
 cause of what you said 
oh  come on 
it s gonna be funny 
yeah  everything s funny to you two
when it s happening to me 
look  you don t have to do it
for anybody you don t want 
i said you d do it

i swear  arlene 
i was not trying to scare you 
i just got lucky 
oh  hardy fucking har

  wait a minute 
  why 
  i was thinking we could make out 
  what  on a porch 
not even in the bar 
but in front of the entrance 
  forget it 
  no  in my car 
what  out there 
it s wet as fucking  nam out there 
not in my car it s not 
look  you won t get wet 
i promise you 
you know  most guys
wouldn t brag about that 
ha ha ha 
you know what i mean 
look  i know you guys are going
to lake lbj  and we can t come 
i wanna make out 
okay  just stop with the whining 
it s not attractive 
okay  but i don t want it
super fucking obvious
to everybody
in the bar i ve been gone 
so we ll go in your car  we ll make out
for six minutes and that s it 
  deal 
  great 
no  no  no  deal or no deal 
if you re gonna whine
when i pull the plug in six minutes 
we can just walk back inside
the fucking bar right now 
  deal  no whining 
  and no begging 
and no begging 
when you say done  it s done 
i m gonna remember
you said that 
okay  let s go 
oh  you got two jobs 
kiss good and make sure
my hair don t get wet 
  it was early  early one morning  
  when i heard my bulldog bark  
   twas staggolee and billy delyon  
  squabbling in the dark  
now look  you can t look like
you re trying to get her out of here
before christian simonson shows up 
but you ve got to get her out of here
before christian simonson shows up 
but what s the point 
they re going to shanna s
daddy s house at lake lbj 
and it s no guys   
absolutely no guys 
okay  so after we bring
the girls drinks 
in fairly rapid order  but not obvious 
we order two more rounds of shots 
you think they re 
gonna fall for that 
we ll be very convincing 
now it s time to turn up the volume 
no more fucking around 
we go to jäger shots 
man  they re not gonna
drink jäger shots 
dude  as long as a guy s buying the booze 
a fucking bitch ll drink anything 
come on  dude  we can at least
get one shot of jäger
down these fucking bitches  throats 
after that  we ll see if they got
another jäger shot in them 
you never know 
that could be the shot that puts
them past the point of  fuck it  
then all of a sudden 
 no guys at the lake house 
turns into  a couple of guys
at the lake house  
my point exactly 
i know i can at least get
shanna  suck my  banana
to do a fucking buttery nipple shot 
what s julia s sweet shot 
  key lime pie 
  oh  come on 
even fucking leroy brown d
do one more for dessert 
dude  check it out 
i wonder if b j 
brought the bear with him 
  well  the last time he shot him  
jesus 
  eastbound and down  
dude fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine 
could i get a chicken suit
for stroker ace  please 
  see the hole i shot in his head  
  the high sheriff told the deputies  
  get your pistols and come with me  
  we got to go
and arrest the bad man  
  known as staggolee  
  the deputies took their pistols  
  they laid them on the shelf  
  if you want that bad man staggolee  
  you ll have to arrest him yourself  
  the high sheriff asked the bartender  
and where did you two
disappear to 
i had to get something out of the car 
and nate was gentlemanly enough
to escort me with his umbrella 
ah  good for you  nate 
you see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar 
who  the dirty hippie 
meow  she s not a hippie 
she might as well be a hippie 
thank you  timmy boy 
well  do you know
what just happened to her 
no  but i know she s a skinny 
fake blonde bitch 
oh  i m sorry 
you were telling a story 
what about her 
hey  warren  is there anybody in this place
you could vouch for to give me a ride home 
fair lady  your chariot awaits 
you ve been eavesdropping 
oh  eavesdropping
and can t help but hear 
i think i belong
in the latter category 
so  uh  icy hot 
are you offering me a ride home 
i m offering you a lift if 
when i m ready to leave  you are  too 
and when are you thinking
about leaving 
truthfully  i m not thinking about it 
but when i do 
you will be the first to know 
will you be able to  uh  drive later 
i know looks can be deceiving 
but i m a teetotaler 
i ve been drinking club soda
and lime all night 
and now i m building up
to my big drink 
which is what 
virgin piña colada 
okay  why would someone
who doesn t drink
spend hours at a bar
drinking water 
a bar offers all kind of things
other than alcohol 
mmm  really 
like what 
women  nacho grande platters 
the fellowship of some
fascinating individuals 
like warren here 
alcohol is just a lubricant
for all the individual encounters
that a barroom offers 
ooh  is that cowboy wisdom 
i m not a cowboy  pam 
i m a stuntman 
but that s a very easy mistake to make 
how do you know my name 
when you were talking with warren 
couldn t help but overhear 
fair enough 
so what s your name  icy 
stuntman mike 
stuntman mike s your name 
you ask anybody 
hey  warren  who is this guy 
stuntman mike 
  and who the hell is stuntman mike 
  he s a stuntman 
warren  six shots of wild turkey 
  and i just got to know  
  should i forgive  
  and find somebody else  
  you know  i stood yesterday  
yeah 
    oh  i can t stand it again  
  yeah 
  let s do  em 
  salud 
down the snatch 
you know  pam 
i think it s time for my big drink 
well  stuntman mike

warren  a  uh  virgin piña colada
for my stuntman friend

cadillac cabo wabo margarita 
cabo wabo  virgin 
  people  i ve been misled  
  and i ve been afraid  
  i ve been hit in the head  
  and left for dead  
  i ve been abused  
  and i ve been accused  
  i ve been refused  
  a piece of bread  
hi  honey  lanna frank 
  mwah  hey  baby 
  how are you 
    in my life before  
  hey 
hey  what s shaking  bacon 
hey 
  i want you to stop  
it s about fucking time 
well  beggars can t be choosers 
take a picture 
it lasts longer 
what 
that table  seems to keep 
um  getting your attention 
is that the girl
from the billboard outside 
  yep 
  she sure is a striking looking woman 
it s got gin  tequila   
  look at that hair 
  lots of leave in conditioner 
  is that jealousy i detect 
  hardly 
but if you wanna get with  uh  jungle julia 
there s a real easy way to do that 
  really 
  yeah 
  what would that be 
  get famous 
you won t have to find her 
she ll find you 
and you don t even wanna know
what she did for that billboard 
enjoy it  cocksucker 
you ve earned it 
what did she ever do to you 
we went to school together
from kindergarten through high school 
that s what she did to me 
she was her height right now at 12 
she was a monster 
half the guys she still fucks
from the old class 
she used to beat up and terrorize
in the fifth grade 
i see  and she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk  huh 
that pituitary case 
might ve kicked my ass
a couple of times 
sorry  i m built like a girl 
not a black man 
but i d die before i ever gave
julia lucai my chocolate milk 
hey  are you famous or something 
or something 
no  no  no  really 
hey  what do you do 
really 
what i do is work my ass off
to get my own record label off the ground 
but why that girl
wanted a picture of me
is because i m a local deejay 
wait a minute 
you got a billboard
by big kahuna burger  don t you 
yeah  i got one there 
too  zatoichi 
yeah 
jungle julia lucai 
stuntman mike mckay 
well  good to meet you 
stuntman mike 
now  my friends and i are gonna
continue to get our weed on 
  would you care for some 
  thank you  julia 
but just the same  no  thanks 
  suit yourself 
  but  you know   
aw  shit  oh  god 
sorry  it s nothing 
what the fuck was that 
actually  i do want you
to have a shot 
you got some voucher here 
i asked him what movies
you worked on 
no fucking clue 
well  technically  i really don t know
if he s ever done anything for sure 
i mean  he shows me
an episode of high chaparall 
a guy falls off a horse 
he says it s him 
you know the show the virginian 
yeah  well  there was another actor
on that show    gary clarke   
and i looked like him a bit 
obviously 
before i cut myself shaving 
oh  i like it 
well  damn if you ain t so sweet 
you make sugar taste just like salt 
anyway  i did a lot of virginians
doubling gary clarke 
and  uh  then that show
turned into the men of shiloh 
they brought on lee majors 
and i doubled him 
from that point on 
i specialized mostly in car stunts 
yeah  i did damn near
the whole third season of vegas 
i was robert urich s driving double 
and then bob did another show    gavilan 
and he brought me 
with him on that till    
and after that    
do you know any of these shows
or people i m talking about 
sorry 
  no 
  no 
so  how exactly does one
become a stuntman 
stuntman mike 
well  in hollywood 
anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it 
but  really  i got into the business
the way most people
get in the stunt business 
  how s that 
  my brother got me in it 
  well  who s your brother 
  stuntman bob 
i m trying to get these two shows
happening in new york for november 
  i m ready to blaze 
  finally  yeah

but you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time i m here 
  promise  you ready to go to the lake 
  mm hmm

ladies 
thanks 
cheers  butterfly 
 the woods are lovely  dark and deep 
 and i have promises to keep

miles to go before you sleep  
sorry  stuntman burt   
mike 
mike  she already
broke off that dance 
is that true 
did i miss my chance 
do i frighten you 
is it my scar 
it s your car 
ah  yeah  i know 
sorry 
it s my mom s car 
have you been following us 
no  but that s what
i love about austin 
it s just so damn small 
  you ve seen this guy before 
  i saw him outside of guero s 
and i saw you outside guero s  too 
you saw my car  i saw your legs 
now  look  i ain t stalking y all 
but i didn t say i wasn t a wolf 
so you really weren t following us 
i m not following you  butterfly 
i just got lucky 
so  how about that lap dance 
sorry  it was a one time only offer 
and she did it earlier
this evening at anton s 
  no  she didn t 
  how do you know 
i m good that way 
and you look a little touchéd 
  what s  touchéd  
  wounded slightly 
why should i be wounded 
because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night 
but from your look 
i can tell nobody pestered you at all 
that kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit  didn t it 
there are few things
as fetching as a bruised ego
on a beautiful angel 
so    
how about that lap dance 
i think i m gonna have to
give you a rain check 
well  since you ll be leaving
in the next couple of days 
that rain check will be worthless 
but that s okay 
i understand
if i make you uncomfortable 
you re still a nice girl 
and i still like you 
but i must warn you of something 
you know how people say    
 you re okay in my book  
or   in my book  that s no good  
well  i actually have a book 
and everybody i ever meet
goes in this book 
and now i ve met you 
and you re going in the book 
except i m afraid i must file you    
under  chickenshit  
and what if i did it

  he wears a purple sash  
  and a black moustache  
  in a honky tonk

    around her waist
she wore three fishnets  
    in mexico  
    she started dancing with the castanets  
    in mexico  
    i didn t know just what to expect  
    in mexico  
    she threw her arms around my neck  
    in mexico  
    we started dancing all around the floor

we re gonna go hang out

  bye 
  bye 
i think you got mike laid tonight 
lookin  good  cannonball run 
he s just giving me a ride 
  oh  no doubt 
  have a nice ride 
look  double fucks    
uh uh  i am not gonna fuck him 
i can hear you 
  he s old enough to be my dad   
  i can still hear you 
  bye 
  bye bye 
wow  that s fucking scary 
yeah  well 
i wanted it to be impressive 
scary tends to impress 
is it safe 
oh  it s better than safe 
it s death proof 
how do you make a car death proof 
well  that s what stuntmen do 
you ve seen a movie
where a car gets into some smash up
there ain t no way in hell
anybody s walking away from 
yeah 
well  how do you think they accomplish that 
cgi 
well  unfortunately  pam  nowadays 
more often than not  you re right 
but back in the all or nothing days 
the vanishing point days 
the dirty mary crazy larry days 
the white line fever days   
real cars
smashing into real cars
with real dumb people
driving them 
so  you give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up 
take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere 
and voilà  you got yourself
a death proof automobile 
that makes sense 
i just didn t know you could
make a car death proof 
hell  i can drive this baby
into a brick wall
doing 125 miles an hour
just for the experience 
why is your passenger seat in a box 
well  this is a movie car 
sometimes when you re shooting a crash 
director wants to put a camera in the car 
you know  shoot the crash
from the inside 
that s where you put the camera 
they call it a crash box  here 
there you go 
you know  when you asked
to drive me home 
you didn t mention your car
didn t have a passenger seat 
yeah  well  actually 
i didn t ask to drive you home 
you asked me for a ride  and i said yes 
but look at the bright side  pam 
i won t be getting fresh
putting my hand on your knee 
that is the bright side 
i thought so 
well  pam  which way you going 
  left or right 
  right 
ah  that s too bad 
why 
well  because there was a 50 50 shot
on whether you d be going left or right 
you see  we re both going left 
you could ve just as easily
been going left  too 
and if that was the case 
it would ve been a while
before you started getting scared 
but since you re going the other way 
i m afraid    
you re gonna have to start
getting scared     immediately 
what the fuck 
cocksucking motherfucker 
just fucking let me out of here 
i ll fucking rip your fucking   
stop the fucking car 
okay  here s the thing 
i get it 
i    i know it s a joke 
and it s super funny 
um  but if you just stop right now 
you know  and    and    and let me out 
i ll never tell anybody 
because i know it s a joke 
i know all about jokes 
i promise everything will be fine 
just    just    just let me out 
please  and    and   
hey  pam 
remember when i said
this car was death proof 
well  that wasn t a lie 
this car is 100  death proof

dr  block 
self restraints to room 310 
self restraints to room 310 
well  what s the patient s
prognosis  dr  block 
i don t really see
it s any of your business 
come on now  sis 
you just tell us 
how bad is he 
he got banged up real good 
busted nose  broken collarbone 
smashed up his left index finger 
is that it 
he was real lucky 
that ll be all 
why  that s more than enough 
and i wanna thank you  dr  block 
son of a bitch 
so  pop  what do you think 
well  son number one 
what i think is so goddamn ghoulish 
i hesitate to speak it out loud 
well  give it a shot 
well  what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide 
that old boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals 
i mean  he used a car and not a hatchet 
but they dead just the same 
well  what are you gonna do 
not a goddamn thing 
the da says ain t no crime here 
every one of them gals
was swimming in alcohol
and floating on weed 
and old hooper in there
came out clean as a whistle 
now  you actually think that he
premeditatedly murdered them gals 
well  i can t prove it 
but since thinking don t cost nothing 
i can think it  and i do 
yeah  but  pop  he got
pretty banged up hisself 
well  hell  yeah  he got banged up 
but god damn 
them pretty little gals
look like a goddamn giant
chewed  em up and spit  em out 
any of  em survive 
shit 
two tons of metal 
200 miles an hour 
flesh and bone
and plain old newton    
they all princess died 
why 
well  i d guestimate
it s a sex thing 
the only way i can figure it 
high velocity impact 
twisted metal  busted glass 
all four souls taken
exactly at the same time 
probably the only way that
diabolical degenerate can shoot his goo 
yeah  i think the only thing
we can dream of getting that bastard on
is vehicular manslaughter
for the hitchhiker in the death box 
that was just plain old goddamn
reckless endangerment 
but i got me a goddamn bartender
gonna testify
that old stuntman mike
didn t drink a drop all night 
and his passenger
was left stranded by her date
in the goddamn rain  no less 
and she asked him for the fucking ride 
now  on paper  it s gonna look like
he s just trying to help her out 
i mean  that s the way
the jury s gonna see it 
so what are you gonna do  pop 
well  i can take it upon myself
to work the case  you know 
in my off hours 
search for evidence 
you know  to prove my theory 
alert authorities 
dog that rotten son of a bitch 
wherever he goes  i go 
or i can spend
the same goddamn amount
of time and energy
following the nascar circuit 
hmm  i thought about it a lot 
i think i d have a hell of lot
happier life if i did the latter 
and just because i can t punish old    
frankenstein in there for what he s done 
i m gonna tell you
like the lord told john 
if he ever does it again 
i can make goddamn sure
he don t do it in texas 
  you know  you re sliding down  
  against your heart  
  yeah  you got one  
  just closing your eyes  
  so you can see  
  no  baby  i don t care
what they say  
  it s so easy  
  no  baby  i don t care
what they say  
  it s so easy  
  yeah  it s coming on  
  it s getting sweeter  
  and sweeter  
  if you re gonna drown  
  do it the right way  
  i don t care what they say  
  it s so easy  
  i don t care what they say

now she s getting it on with the rock 
  you re having one off with the rock

 cause he kind of looks like the rock 
so now we all just call him the rock 
oh  yeah 
this is an all star crew 
we got a guy who looks like nick cage

like pee wee herman  too 
kim  dick department

i got a man 
  how long have you had this boyfriend 
  about three months 
who d you steal him from 
  nobody 
  kim 
wha    what 
he totally had a girlfriend 
all of kim s boyfriends start out
as somebody else s boyfriend 
i did not steal him 
i didn t steal any of them 
they just     jumped ship 
so  what s your story  abernathy 
oh  abbie s got the big kahuna 
i had a set crush on cecil 
set crush  nigga  please 
you were his set wife 
 were  and  had 
being the key words here 
bitch  you two are still
into each other  and you know it 
yeah  well 
if he s so in love with me 
then whey did he fuck
daryl hannah s stand in 
ho ho ho 
yes  men are dogs 
oh  it s so funny 
oh  it s so funny 
oh  stop acting all hurt 
your ass just mad 
yeah  he s a stand in fucker 
bitch  you need to get over that shit 
that was two weeks ago 
oh  well 
now that you put it like that 
oh  i haven t told you
the best part 
he fucked her on my birthday 
oh  that s a horse of a different color 
thank you 
did he know it was your birthday 
he s the director 
he s kind of busy 
he ate a piece of my birthday cake
and he got me a present 
yeah  i think he knew 
well  what did he get you 
he made me a tape 
he made you a tape 
  yeah 
  wait 
he didn t burn you a cd 
he made you a tape 
  yeah 
  oh  that is so romantic 
yes  i know what you re gonna say 
so don t even go there 
that sounds like the test
of true love to me 
look  i know you guys like him 
he s likable  but he fucked
another woman on my birthday 
how can you not be on my side 
well  i admit  that sounds bad 
it is bad 
it just sounds like
there s a little more to it than that 
  were you two fucking 
  hell  no 
hello  is your name abernathy 
sorry 
the answer to your question
is no  of course not 
what do you mean 
 no  of course not  
the reason cecil hasn t had a girlfriend
in six years is because girls will fuck him 
and if you fuck cecil 
you don t become one of his girlfriends 
not to say i want
to be his girlfriend 
but if i did want to be his girlfriend 
if i fucked him 
i wouldn t be his girlfriend 
i d be one of his regulars 
and i m just getting
too fucking old for that shit 
have you let him do anything 
yes 
i ve let him give me a foot massage 
and when we go to the movies 
i ve let him hold my hand 
bitch  you might be acting
like you 12 years old 
but he just acting like a man 
you need to break
that nigga off a piece 
let me get this straight 
  you re not fucking him    
  mm mm 
  you re not sucking him    
  mm mm 
you re not giving him any tongue 
but daryl hannah s stand in is 
okay  can we just take
my sex life off the table 
actually  uh  it was cecil s sex life
that was on the table and your lack of one 
ohhh 
fuck both of you
and your little high five 
before you can claim a nigga 
you got to claim a nigga 
and you can start by giving
that motherfucker a hand job
in the back of the van on tuesday 
i m not gonna do that 
i know you won t 
but you know who will 
the bitch that ends up living
in that big ass mansion of his 
now  i gotta say  i haven t entirely agreed
with everything kim said  but it is true 
if you stretch shit out
like you have with cecil 
and you suddenly get dirty on them 
it blows their mind 
so  zoë  kim and i are in the philippines
at an outdoor rave 
  what were you working on 
  three kicks to the head  part three 
and  admittedly 
we re a little fucked up 
  cheers to that 
  word 
cheers 
so  zoë 
the genius 
wants to take a picture of me 
it s dark as hell 
and you can t see shit 
so she s got her camera
and keeps saying 
 step back a little   so i do 
then   a little further  
so i step back a little further 
then   a little more   so i do 
then i realize i m right at the edge
of a seven foot concrete ditch
with god knows how many rocks
and broken bottles and rats in it 
and if i fell in that fucking thing 
i d probably would ve broken my fucking neck 
so i m yelling at her 
 zoë  you almost killed me  
so we laugh about it
and walk a little further 
and zoë starts fucking around 
and damn if she doesn t fall
in the fucking ditch 
nice  nice 
thank you  yep  thank you 
i remember taking a step
and looking down 
just as i m thinking 
 there s that ditch abbie was talking about  
bam  i m in the fucking ditch 
you know 
what happened 
what  with zoë the cat 
nothing 
if i fell in that fucking thing 
they would ve had to
helicopter me out of there 
zoë just lands on her feet 
but then  later  i started feeling
a little bad about myself 
zoë falls in the ditch 
and it s nothing 
we re laughing about it 
if i fell in that fucking thing 
i probably would ve been
fucking paralyzed 
oh  honey  you can t think like that 
you know  we all have
our individual talents 
and that just happens
to be one of zoë s 
  yeah 
  well    
physically speaking  zoë is amazing 
i mean  agility  reflexes  nimbleness 
there s few human beings
that can fuck with zoë on that front 
oh  kim  i like you  too 
having said that 
before you get too envious
of zoë s prowess 
you re missing the most important
part of that story 
you didn t fall in the ditch 
zoë did 
zoë even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her 
and she still fell in 
so  lee s right 
we all have our talents 
hey  i resemble that remark 
so  kim 
you still pack a roscoe 
check it out  bitch 
  ooh  nice one  mate 
  i know this 
  what s a roscoe 
  a roscoe is a pistol 
  you carry a gun 
  uh huh 
  you have a license to carry it 
  yeah 
when i became a secret service agent 
they gave me a license 
oh  i didn t know you were   
okay  i didn t say it  all right 
stop looking at me  i didn t say it 
god 
did you know kim carried a gun 
yes  now  do i approve  no 
do i know  yes 
look  i don t know what
futuristic utopia you live in 
but the world i live in 
a bitch need a gun 
you can t get around the fact
that people who carry guns
tend to get shot
more than people who don t 
and you can t get around the fact
that if i go down
to the laundry room in my building
at midnight enough times 
i might get my ass raped 
don t do your laundry at midnight 
fuck that  i wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck i wanna do my laundry 
there are other things
you can carry other than a gun 
pepper spray 
uh  motherfucker try to rape me 
i don t wanna give him a skin rash 
i wanna shut that nigga down 
how about a knife at least 
yeah  you know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives 
they get shot 
look  if i ever become
a famous actress 
i won t carry a gun 
i ll hire me a do dirt nigga 
and he ll carry the gun 
and when shit goes down 
i ll sit back and laugh 
but until that day 
it s wild west  motherfucker 
so  zoë  you thought about
what you want to do first 
it just so happens
i know exactly what i wanna do 
oh  really 
and what would that be 
to me  there s no point
in being in america
unless you can drive
a detroit muscle car 
and i wanna drive a dodge challenger 
fuck me swinging  balls out 
um  well  i guess we 
can talk to transpo 
but does it have to be
a dodge challenger 
not just that 
it has to be a 1970 dodge challenger
with a 440 engine 
how in the fuck do 
you expect to do that 
no worries  mate 
i ve got it all worked out 
when i knew i was coming here 
i went online and found out
that the local paper here in tennessee
is the lebanon news sentinel 
  so  back home   
  i m sorry  where s home 
australia  right 
what do you mean by that  mate 
zoë s from new zealand 
and you never   
i repeat  never   
call a kiwi an aussie 
that is  unless you want
your ass kicked 
i m so sorry 
i really am 
oh  it s okay 
we re just taking the piss
out of you  mate 
auckland  to answer your question 
anyway  i subscribed
to the local paper a month ago 
now  why the fuck you want a local
redneck newspaper in new zealand 
pipe down  and i ll tell you 
i ve been getting the paper

you said we ain t ever
gonna do that again 
  yeah  but   
   but   my ass 
you said not only are we never
gonna play ship s mast again 
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now
to not only refuse 
but that i had permission
to physically restrain
your ass if necessary 
now  did you
or did you not say that 
  well   
  no  no  no  no

yes  i said that 
however   
whatever with your  however  
look  i know i said it 
and i know i meant it   
damn skippy you meant it 
yeah  but when i said it 
i didn t mean in america 
  oh  nigga  please 
  really   
i meant we should never play
ship s mast again
in new zealand or australia 
you are such a liar 
look  i know what i said
when i said it 
but when i said it  i didn t know
i d ever come to america 
and when i said it  if i had known
i was going to come to america
and had the opportunity
to play ship s mast
with a fucking
vanishing point challenger 
i would ve added a  however  
right 
okay  oddly enough 
i actually understood that 
however  just because you
talked yourself into some stupid shit
doesn t mean i have lost
my goddamn mind 
you need two people
to play ship s mast  and i ain t playing 
i ll be your best friend 
i don t need me no best friend
lives on the other side of planet earth 
  i ll crack your back 
  you ll crack it anyway 
well  of course i ll crack it anyway 
but now  while i m here 
i ll be your back cracking slave 
whenever you want it  you got it 
you don t even have to ask for it 
you just order me to do it 
just be  like    
 bitch  get over here and get busy  
  you crack my back 
you ll give me foot massages    
  mm hmm  mmm 
and after a shower 
you put moisturizer on my butt 
deal 
so  we re gonna see if this guy ll
let us take the car out without him 
if he does  you wait here with lee 
and we ll be back in a moment 
what 
i said  we re gonna see if this guy ll
let us take the car out without him   
i heard what you said 
i just can t believe what you said 
you know  you two got
some fucking balls 
what 
don t play dumbass with me 
i ve been up all night 
i m still a little drunk
and i have a hangover 
i should be in my hotel room asleep 
not fucking around here on tobacco road 
but because zoë wanted to drive
some fucking vanishing point car  i m here 
now you two got the balls
to ask me    no  scratch that   
tell me i gotta go make
conversation with tom joad
while the cool kids
get to go out and play 
bullshit on that 
  it ain t like that 
  then what s it like  kim 
you guys are our collateral 
he is never gonna go for it
if we all go 
i really think one human being
will be collateral enough 
you re not gonna wanna do
what we re doing 
what  drive a car 
  mmm 
  we re doing more than that 
what  drive it fast 
we re doing more than that 
actually 
we re paying you a compliment 
 cause we gonna do
some stupid shit 
but that s okay  we re stunt people 
we ain t got good sense 
but you got good sense 
and anybody with good sense
ain t gonna wanna do what we re doing 
how do you know
i don t wanna do it 
   cause you re a mom 
  yeah 
you know  we re supposed
to be this big posse 
but that s the excuse you guys use
whenever you want
to exclude me from something 
so  what is it you two daredevils
are doing that i m just so uncool 
i couldn t possibly understand 
you know 
we re kind of conning this guy 
so maybe it s best that we don t go
into detail about it while he s watching us 
besides  he s probably not
gonna let us do it anyway 
okay  how about this 
i ll talk him into it 
but if i talk him into it  i go along 
  how you gonna do that 
  eh  that s my problem 
but don t worry 
he ll say yes 
what are you gonna do 
blow him 
no 
i m gonna insinuate
that lee s gonna blow him 
that s good 
not really 
but let me handle it 
we got a deal 
okay  mommy  listen up 
you wanna hang with the cool kids 
you got to be cool 
we take you along 
you don t say shit 
you don t even say crap 
you just sit in the back 
and i don t wanna hear
a peep out of your ass

the girl of color 
and reason number four 
and the most important 
while we re taking the car out
for a little spin 
that ll give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted
with our other friend  lee 
why does she look kind of familiar 
that would be because
she s a famous actress

well  you see  we re making
a hollywood movie in town
