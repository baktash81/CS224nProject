chattering in french
excuse me
beeping
whistle blowing softly
whistle blowing
thank you for coming
in the name of the president i want
to personally apologize for this mess
i want to stress that we would
not want anything like this
to jeopardize the warm relation
and successful economic ties
shared by our two countries
so
we have assigned our best man
to supervise this case
he handled the tehran incident
for us masterfully
there is no one more qualified
to bring this
to a mutually
beneficial conclusion
inspector richard bonjour
sir minister
this is minister tang our liaison
from the peoples republic of china
its an honor to meet you sir
the honor is ours
the minister tells us
you are the best of the best
well the minister is too kind
if that were true
i might have been able
to avoid this tragedy
im hoping that you might help us
understand what went wrong
so that we can avoid
further bloodshed
and hopefully bring this matter to
a quick and satisfactory conclusion
if we could be showed the facts
yes of course
please
uh as you know
as soon as you informed us
of the criminal activities of the gangster sung
we set our operation in motion
we identified his heroin
smuggling routes into france
and in the spirit of cooperation
we graciously accepted your offer
to have one of your people
liu jian come over
to assist us in sungs arrest as he
was meeting with his french contact
who unfortunately
we havent yet identified
here
he is surveilling sung as we were
waiting for the contact to arrive
and here hes observing
along with us
and then for some reason we still cant
understand he went completely insane
left the room to pee
and next thing we know
hes knocked out the bodyguards
killed sung and the prostitute
this is the gun
he used to murder sung
chinese police issue
do you recognize it
yes
good
oh we have also verified
his fingerprints on the weapon
well please feel free to verify
our findings with your own people
we assume that your man was
part of the conspiracy
that he murdered sung to
keep him from being captured
and testifying in your courts
as you had requested
but that is only an assumption
we are hoping you could give us
some background on him
which would help us in his capture
inspector liu jian was top in
all his classes at the academy
he received the highest training
in martial arts weapons and police tactics
hes been decorated for bravery
in the line of duty six times
been promoted five times
and has never lost a case
he has no wife no children
his only dedication
is to his work
hes our best
which is why
this is all so confusing
well you know sometimes
the best are also the worst
its really sad
any surveillance cassettes
destroyed as he made his escape
do you know if he has any relatives
in paris any friends or
he has no one
well then we should be able
to wrap this up very soon
cell phone ringing
excuse me

oh thats good news

goes to your head
it stops there never comes down
but soon it will come out
from your nose
your ears
even from your eyes
and then
you will die painfully
gasping
youre really a smart guy
johnny boy
my name is notjohnny
gasping
coughing
gurgling sounds
i slept long
only a minute
my daughter
woman singing
