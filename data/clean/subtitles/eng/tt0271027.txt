  chattering in french  
excuse me 
  beeping  
  whistle blowing softly  
  whistle blowing  
thank you for coming 
in the name of the president  i want
to personally apologize for this mess 
i want to stress that we would
not want anything like this   
to jeopardize the warm relation
and successful economic ties   
shared by our two countries 
so   
we have assigned our best man
to supervise this case 
he handled the tehran incident
for us masterfully 
there is no one more qualified
to bring this   
to a mutually
beneficial conclusion 
  inspector richard  bonjour 
  sir minister 
this is minister tang  our liaison
from the people s republic of china 
  it s an honor to meet you  sir 
  the honor is ours 
the minister tells us
you are the best of the best 
well  the minister is too kind 
if that were true   
i might have been able
to avoid this tragedy 
i m hoping that you might help us
understand what went wrong   
so that we can avoid
further bloodshed 
and hopefully  bring this matter to
a quick and satisfactory conclusion 
if we could be showed the facts 
yes  of course 
please 
uh  as you know 
as soon as you informed us   
of the criminal activities of the gangster sung 
we set our operation in motion 
we identified his heroin
smuggling routes into france 
and in the spirit of cooperation 
we graciously accepted your offer   
to have one of your people 
liu jian  come over   
to assist us in sung s arrest as he
was meeting with his french contact   
who unfortunately
we haven t yet identified 
here   
he is surveilling sung as we were
waiting for the contact to arrive 
and here  he s observing
along with us 
and then  for some reason we still can t
understand  he went completely insane 
left the room to pee 
and next thing we know   
he s knocked out the bodyguards 
killed sung and the prostitute 
this is the gun
he used to murder sung 
chinese police issue 
do you recognize it 
  yes 
  good 
oh  we have also verified
his fingerprints on the weapon 
well  please  feel free to verify
our findings with your own people 
we assume that your man was
part of the conspiracy  
that he murdered sung to
keep him from being captured   
and testifying in your courts 
as you had requested 
but that is only an assumption 
we are hoping you could give us
some background on him   
which would help us in his capture 
inspector liu jian was top in
all his classes at the academy 
he received the highest training
in martial arts  weapons and police tactics 
he s been decorated for bravery
in the line of duty six times   
been promoted five times 
and has never lost a case 
he has no wife  no children 
his only dedication
is to his work 
he s our best   
which is why
this is all so confusing 
well  you know  sometimes
the best are also the worst 
it s really sad 
any surveillance cassettes 
destroyed as he made his escape 
do you know if he has any relatives
in paris  any friends or 
he has no one 
well  then we should be able
to wrap this up very soon 
    cell phone ringing  
  excuse me 
    mandarin  
  i found the emergency phone 
oh  that s good news 
stay by the phone

inspector richard

that the operation was sabotaged 
i will report back to my superiors
and get you any help i can 
  thank you 
  let me show you out 
i want them followed 
i want their phones tapped 
i want to know every move they make 
every word they speak

  bell dinging  
hi 
  clears throat  
  need any help 
  no 
i have some experience 
you know  the longer that
that thing stays open   
the more risk there is of infection
setting in  and then you are in for it 
i once had a scrape i ignored 
i let it go for a couple days 
  it turned into staph infection 
  all right 
but only to sew it 
  then you must leave  okay 
  yeah 
doesn t like me standing outside  huh 
your uncle 
well  i don t blame him 
if i were him   
i wouldn t like me
standing out there either 
now  this is gonna sting 
believe me  if i had any other
place to stand  i would 
it s just all the good spots
get taken by the others and  
you would not believe how much business
some of these girls do 
  guess how much some of them do in a day

all you ve got in your crummy cop s life 
you take richard down  and it s just
gonna leave a space for another bastard   
one who we pray will be less of
a bastard than the one before him 
and that s reality

and there s nothing you or anybody else
can do to change that

and then he takes me as a hostage 
he made me carry this stuff  and he dragged me
all the way up to that church  
you know  the big church
on the top of the hill 
and then   you know
