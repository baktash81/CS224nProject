six weeks ago 
a truck loaded with stripped gun
parts got jacked outside of queens 
the driver didn t see anybody
but somebody fucked up 
he heard a voice 
sometimes  that s all you need 
mr  mcmanus

fuck you 
todd hockney 
who wants to know 
new york police department

that changes with the taste   
without losing the overall aesthetic 
in other words  the atmosphere
will not be painted on the walls

we have some questions
to ask you downtown 
no  no  please    sit down

i mean  these guys were hardcore hijackers   
   but there i was 
at that point i wasn t scared 
i knew i hadn t done anything
they could do me for 
besides  it was fun

this has really got to be   
   embarrassing for you guys 
they drilled us all night 
somebody was pissed about that truck
getting hijacked  and the cops had nothing 
they were hoping somebody would
slip up and give them something to go on 
they knew we wouldn t fight it
because they knew how to lean on us 
they d been doing it forever 
i mean  our rights went out the window 
it was a violation  i mean  disgraceful 
they went after mcmanus first

dean keaton

was it you that
hit that truck 
forget him 
you got to talk
to your lawyer 
this whole thing
was a shakedown 
what makes you say that 
how many times have
you been to a line up 
it s always you
and four dummies 
p d  are paying homeless guys
ten bucks a head half the time 
and there s no way they d line
five felons in the same row  no way 
and what s a
voice line up 
a public defender could
get you out of that one 
so why the hell was i
strip searched 
it was the feds 
a truckload of guns
gets snagged   
   customs comes down to n y p d  looking
for answers   they come up with us 
they are clutching
at straws 
ah  the guys fingered

then  too  what happened 
i walked 
ninety days 
suspended 
so you did it 
all right  now look   
we ve all been put out by
this whole thing  right 
so i figure we owe it to
ourselves to salvage a little dignity
now   
   me and fenster heard
about a little job 
why don t you just
calm down 
why do you care
what he has to say 
i m just talking here 
and it seems to me like mr  hockney
wants to hear what i got to say   
   and i know fenster s down 
what about you guy 
i m interested  sure 
there  see 
so now i d like to exercise
my right to free assembly

i don t want to hear
anything from you 
i don t care
about your job 
and    i want nothing
to do with any of you 
i beg your pardon   
   but you can all
go to hell 
dean keaton   
   gone the high road 
what is the world coming to 
fuck him 
and that was how it started 
the five of us being brought in on a trumped up
charge to be leaned on by half wits 
ok  now i really can t talk
about it much here   
what the cops never figured out 
and what i know now   
   was that these men would
never break  never lie down   
   never bend over for anybody   
   anybody 
who are you 
agent jack baer  fbi 
how many dead 
15 so far  they re still pulling some
bodies out of the water  though 
any survivors 
yeah  there s two 
one guy is in county hospital  but he s
in a coma  the d a  has the second guy   
   a cripple from new york  i think 
listen  the chief wants
this place sealed off 
if you have any questions 
give him a call  
this is dave kujan  i ll be in
los angeles until tuesday 
if you need to reach me  contact   
   jeff rabin at the
san pedro p d   at extension 112

  why can t i see him 
  dave  i told you   
   the d a  came down here last night   
   ready to arraign even before
they moved him to county  ok 
kint s lawer shows up five minutes later   
   d a  comes out of the office looking like
the boogey man smacked him around 
allright  they take the statement
and they cut him a deal 
what  did they charge
him with anything 
yeah  weapons 
misdemeanor two 
what is that 
listen  i give the d a  credit for
getting that much  you understand 
excuse me 
this whole thing
has turned political 
the major was here last night  the chief 
this morning   
   the governor called  ok 
i m telling you this guy is protected from
up on high by the prince of darkness 
take my word for it 
when does he post bail 
maybe two hours  tops 
i want to see him 
  no  dave 
  i gotta see him  jeffrey 
dave  no 
i can not do this for you 
i came a long way for this 
dave  please 
even if i let you talk to him 
he won t talk to you 
he s paranoid about
being recorded 
he knows the interrogation
rooms are wired 
this won t be an interrogation   
   just a friendly chat
to kill some time 
he will not go into
the interrogation room 
  just someplace else  then 
  where 
if this was a dope deal 
where s the dope 
if it was a hit 
who called it in 
i m sure you have a host of wild
theories to answer all these questions 
  you know damn well what i think 
  that s crazy 
and besides  it doesn t even matter   
   the guy s got total immunity 
his story checks out 
he doesn t know what
you want to know 
i don t think he does 
not exactly 
but there s a lot more
to his story  believe me 
jeffrey  look    i want to know why
27 men died on that pier   
   for what looks to be 91 million dollars
worth of dope that wasn t there 
and above all   
   i want to be sure
dean keaton is dead 
he s dead 
c mon  two hours 
just  till he makes bail 
they re all dead 
i don t care how tough a guy
you say this keaton was   
   nobody on that boat
could have come out alive 
is he talking 
he regained consciousness
less than an hour ago   
   he spoke  not english   
then he lapsed 
  hungarian 
  i don t know  i think that may have been what it was 
yeah  most of them
were hungarians 
you ve got to put on these 
burn victims are very
succeptible to infections 
and  of course 
there is no smoking 
keep your mask up 
please don t touch him 
is he gonna die 
he has burns over 60  of his body 
a number of his ribs are broken  
call hospital security 
get a man  put him on the door
until the police get here 
is he dangerous 
yes 
do it

i love you 
they ruined me in there tonight 
i love you 
do you hear me 
what

let s just go to my place 
we ll worry about this tomorrow 
fenster and mcmanus had a cagey proposition 
a fast jump  high risk 
long money 
we all knew it could be done 
the way i figured 
to do it wrong meant killing 
to do it right took five men 
five men meant keaton 
keaton took convincing 
new york finest taxi service 
bullshit 
they don t operate anymore 
mcmanus has a friend in the 14th precinct 
they re coming out for one job   thursday 
they are picking up a guy smuggling
emeralds out of south america 
mcmanus already has a fence
set to take the stuff 
a fence  who 
some guy in california 
his name is redfoot 
i never heard of him 
you have to come 
what s it to you
wether i do it not 
they  
they don t know me  you do 
they won t take me
unless you go 
look at me 
i need this 
oh  are you telling me
you don t need this 
is this your place 
i m not knocking you  you look like you ve got
a good little scam going on with this lawyer  
sorry 
it s ok 
you say it s the real thing 
that s cool 
you re ok 
i was out of line 
but they re never going to stop
with us  you know that 
as clean as you could ever get 
they ll never let you go now 
this way we hit the cops where it
hurts and we get well in the mean time 
you sure you re ok 
i ll be all right 
look  i   
     sometimes get  
  forget it 
i probably shit blood tonight 
so  how do they want to do it 
mcmanus wants to go in shooting 
i say no 
fenster 
hockney 
they re pretty pissed off 
they ll do anything 
now  i ve got a way of doing
it without killing anyone 
but  as i said  they won t
let me in without you 
three million 
maybe more 
no killing 
not if we do it my way 
new york s finest taxi service was
not your normal taxi service 
it was a ring of corrupt cops in the
n y p d  that ran a high profit racket   
   driving smugglers and drug
dealers all over the city 
for a few hundred dollars a mile 
you got your own blue and white   
   and a police escort 
they even had their
own business cards 
after a while  somebody
started asking   
   questions and the
taxi service shut down 
ever since then  internal affairs had been
waiting to catch them in the act 
and that s where we came in 
so  how was the flight 
fucking great 
will this get me to staten island 
kidding me  this will
get you to cape cod 
mcmanus came to us with the job 
fenster got the vans   
   hockney supplied the hardware 
i came through with how
to do it so no one got killed 
but keaton   
keaton put on
the finishing touch 
a little  fuck you  from the
five of us to the n y p d   
all right  watch this 
careful 
asshole 
don t move  you fucker 
  who the

keaton made an
anonymous phone call   
   the press was on the scene
before the police were 
strausz and rizzi were
indicted three days later 
within a few weeks  50 more
cops went down with them 
everybody got it right in the ass 
from the chief on down 
it was beautiful 
i owe you  2 50  
there s more here than i thought 
when does the fence come 
redfoot never comes to see me

no  no  no   
you fuckin  kiddin  me 
ok  so   
   who s gonna go 
we all go 
what s your fucking
problem  man 
my fucking problem  man  is that you and
fenster are off honeymooning in california   
   while the rest of us are
sitting here holding our dicks 
hey 
the job s over 
cool it 
l a  is a good place
to lay low for a while 
wanna dance 
ladies   
i would like to propose a toast   
there you go 
   to mr  verbal   
   the man with the plan 
we re gonna miss the flight 
don t do this 
send her a note   something 
i said we ll make it 
we re gonna miss the plane 
she ll understand 
that s heartwarming 
really 
i m weepy 
jeff  you wanna wait outside 
you guys wanted to know what happened
after the line up  i m telling you 
come on  verbal 
who do you think
you re talking to 
you expect me to believe
that he retired 
for a woman 
bullshit 
keaton was using her 
he loved her 
sure 
i m supposed to believe that hitting the
taxi service wasn t his idea either 
it was all fenster and mcmanus 
c mon  keaton was
a cop for 4 years 
who else would know the taxi service better 
that job had his name written all over it 
but edie had him
all turned around 
let me tell you something 
i know dean keaton 
i ve been investigating him
for the past 3 years 
the guy i know was a
cold blooded bastard 
i a d  indicted him on three counts of murder
before he was kicked off the force 
so don t sell me the hooker
with the heart of gold 
you got him all wrong 
do i 
dean keaton was under indictment a total
of 7 times while he was on the force 
in every case the witnesses either
reversed their testimony to the grand jury   
   or died before they could testify 
when they finally nailed him for fraud
he spent five years in sing sing 
he killed three
prisioners inside 
of course
i can t prove this 
but i can t prove
the best part either 
dean keaton was dead 
did you know that 
he died in a fire
two years ago   
   during an investigation into
the murder of a witness   
   who was going to
testify against him 
two people saw dean keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned   
   just before it blew up 
they said he went in to
check a leaking gas main 
it blew up  and took all
of dean keaton with it 
within three months
of the explosion   
   the two witnesses 
they were dead 
one killed himself in his car   
   the other fell down an
open elevator shaft 
agent baer 
this is not what we discussed 
there are far too many people in this room  
look  doctor  i promise we ll be out of
here before he blows his porcelain  ok 
i have a noon meeting  baer 
  agent baer  five minutes 
  look  everyone just calm down  all right 
i want you to ask this man about the shoot out in the harbor 
he says they were buying  
dope  we know 
he doesn t know what they
were buying  but not dope    people 
what 
he needs guarantees   
what is he talking about 
he says his life s in danger 
he saw the devil 
looked him in the eye 
  i m on my way 
  no  no  wait a minute 
ask him to tell him what he told me 
about the devil 
who s the devil 
keyser soze 
he was in the harbor   
   killing many men 
he saw keyser soze 
he saw his face 
tell him to tell her what he looks like 
describe him 
six weeks ago i get an anonymous
phone call telling me   
   i could find keaton eating at mondino s
with his attourney  and there he is 
now  because he never
profited from his alleged death   
   and because we convicted someone
else of the murder we tried to pin on him   
   we had to let him go 
he was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over 
and then he had lunch 
i don t know about that 
oh  i don t think you do 
but you say you saw keaton die 
i think you re covering his ass   
   and he s still out there somewhere 
i think he s behind that
whole circus at the harbor 
my bet is he s using you because your re
stupid and you think he s your friend 
you tell me he s dead 
so be it 
i want to be sure he s dead
before i go back to new york 
he wasn t behind anything 
it was the lawyer 
what lawyer 
what lawyer  verbal 
you know  back when i was with that

it s an awful shame about
saul getting waxed 
cops are gonna be looking

sooner or later they re
gonna come  round asking me 
you have a sweet night  ladies 
  so this lawyer   
  kobayashi 
     came from redfoot 
  right 
and why leave this out
when you talked to the d a  
dave  someone to see you 
jack  i ve been looking all over for you 
you still after that coke that took a walk out
of that blood bath in the harbor yesterday 
  yeah 
  well  you can stop looking  it was no coke 
i ve been in l a  county talking
to a guy they pulled out   
   of a drainpipe in san pedro
yesterday after the shoot out 
he came to this morning 
he started talking 
he was part of a hungarian mob there to do
a deal with a bunch of goats from argentina   
   and he says it was
definitely not a dope deal 
  but the 91 mill  
  yeah  we know 
our man says
no way on the dope 
this hungarian tells me the whole bunch
was pulling stumps for turkey the next day 
they had no time to negotiate that kind
of product and no means to move it 
  what s the money for 
  he didn t know 
no one doing the deal knew 
except for a few key people 
they all were very hush
about it  he says 
whatever it was 
it s very sensitive 
i don t get it 
they tell me you got that cripple there
from new york  did he mention keyser soze 
who 
just bear with me here 
who s keyser soze 
oh  fuck 
we ve been going over this
for an hour and a half 
what we need to do is find redfoot
and get the hell out of here now 
what we need to do is think 
think back 
somebody   
   with power 
somebody who was capable of tracking
us from new york to los angeles 
come on  dean  what the
hell are we doing here 
we re waiting 
  bye now 
  sit down 
  no  i m fucking bored  
  mr  hockney  do stay  mr  keaton   
   mr  fenster i recognize from his
mug shots  as well as mr  mcmanus 
i can only assume that you are mr  kint 
the gentleman who disposed of saul berg 
my employer sends his gratitude 
a most unexpected benefit 
i am mr  kobayashi 
i have been asked by my
employer to bring a proposal   
   to you gentlemen 
  what do you want 
  my employer requires your services gentlemen 
one job  one day s work  very dangerous 
he does not expect all of you to live 
but those of you who do   
   will have 91 million dollars
to divide between you   
     in any way you see fit 
  who s your boss 
  i work for keyser soze 
  who s keyser soze 
  judging by the sudden change in mood  mr  kint   
   i feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you 
i come with an offer
directly from mr  soze 
an order  actually 
what do you mean  an order 
in 1981  mr  keaton    
   you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in buffalo  new york 
the cargo was raw steel 
steel which belonged to mr  soze   
   and which was destined for pakistan 
to be used in a nuclear reactor 
a most profitable violation
of u n  regulations 
you had no way of
knowing this  mr  keaton   
   because the fellow shipping the
steel was working for mr  soze   
   without his knowledge 
earlier this year   
   mr  fenster and mr  mcmanus hijacked a
two prop cargo flight out of newark airport 
the plane was carrying gold and platinum
wiring  also set for pakistan 
two months ago  mr  hockney
stole a truck carrying gun parts   
   through queens   
   gun parts which where set to be
destroyed by the state of new york 
they would be  lost  in a weigh
station and rerouted to belfast 
again  mr  soze  using pawns
who had no knowledge 
which brings us to mr  kint 
nine months ago   
   one of mr  soze s
less than intelligent couriers   
   was taken in a complicated
confidence scan   by a cripple 
he was relieved of 62 000 dollars 
now  it has taken us
some time to find you 
our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in new york 
you set up the line up   
yes  you were not to be released
until i had come to see you 
it seems mr  keatons
attourney  ms  finneran   
   was a little too effective
in expediting his release 
holding the rest of you
became a moot point 
  what about redfoot 
  mr  redfoot knew nothing 
mr  soze rarely works
with the same people   
   for very long  and they
never know who they re working for 
one cannot be betrayed
if one has no people 
so    why telling us 
because you have stolen
from mr  soze  mr  fenster 
all of you 
that you did not know
you stole from him   
   is the only reason
you re still alive 
he feels you owe him 
you will repay your debt 
all right  fuck the debt 
and fuck you 
how do we know
you work for soze 
i don t think that is very
relevant  mr  hockney 
all five of you are responsible for the
murder of saul berg and his bodyguards 
mr  redfoot can testify to your involvement 
and we can see to it that he will 
  what s your point 
  the offer is this  gentlemen 
mr  soze s primary interest   
   is narcotics 
he has been  competing   shall we say 
with a group of argentinians   
   for several years now 
competing with mr  soze
has taken its toll 
these argentinians are
negotiating the sale   
   of 91 million dollars in
cocaine in 3 days time 
needless to say  this
purchase will revitalize   
   the diminishing strength
of their organization 
mr  soze would like you
to stop the deal 
if you choose  you may
wait until after the buy 
whatever money changes hands
is yours 
mr  soze would like you to get to the
boat and destroy the cocaine onboard 
and then you will be free of
your obligations to mr  soze 
you give me one good reason
why i shouldn t kill you right now 
a gift   
   from mr  soze 
good day  gentlemen 
they ve got my whole life in here 
everything i ve ever done since i was 18 
they fucking know everything 
everybody i ve ever worked
with or did time with 
  no    this isn t right 
  i don t know 
who was that guy who used
to talk about soze in new york 
bricks marlin 
yeah  he did jobs for him 
indirect stuff 
he said he always made 5 times
more money than the job was worth 
this guy s a pipe dream 
kobayashi is using him for window dressing 
i don t know 
this is bad 
that s bullshit  this guy could be l a p d     
it s a fucking setup 
ah  the way i hear it  soze   
is some kind of butcher 
a fearless psycho   
fucked up butcher 
there is no keyser soze 
who is keyser soze 
he s supposed to be turkish 
some say his father was german 
nobody ever believed
he was real 
nobody ever knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him   
   but to hear kobayashi tell it 
anybody could have worked for soze 
you never knew 
that was his power 
the greatest trick
the devil ever pulled   
   was convincing the
world he didn t exist 
one story the guys told me
 the story i believe     
   was from his days in turkey 
there was a gang of hungarians
that wanted their own mob 
they realized that to be in power   
   you didn t need guns 
or money  or even numbers 
you just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn t 
after a while  they come into power
and then they come after soze 
he was small time then 
just running dope they say 
they come to his home   
   in the afternoon   
   looking for his business 
they find his wife and
kids in the house   
   and decide to
wait for soze 
he comes home   
   to find his wife raped
and children screaming 
the hungarians knew soze was
tough  not to be trifled with 
so they let him know
they meant business 
they tell him they want his territory 
all of his business 
soze looks over the
faces of his family   
   then he showed these men of will
what will really was 
he tells him he would
rather see his family dead   
   than live another
day after this 
he lets the last hungarian go 
he waits until his wife and kids are in the ground
and then he goes after the rest of the mob 
he kills their kids  he kills their wives 
he kills their parents   
   and their parents friends 
he burns down the
houses they live in   
   and the stores
they work in 
he kills people that owe them
money  and like that   
   he s gone 
underground 
nobody has ever seen him since 
he becomes a myth 
a spook story that criminals
tell their kids at night 
 rat on your pop
and keyser soze will get you  
no one ever really believes 
do you believe
in him  verbal 
keaton always said 
 i don t believe in god 
but i m afraid of him  
well  i believe in god 
and the only thing that
scares me is keyser soze 
you give any weight to this 
i can introduce you to
dan metzheiser from justice 
he s got a file on soze in d c   
i ts been a hobby of his for a couple of years 
a lot of guys equate him to that
reporter on the incredible hulk 
  you ve heard of him 
  what  on the street 
a few times 
outside stuff 
somebody working for a guy
who works for a guy   
   who got some money from keyser soze 
y know  shit like that 
could be an old badge 
a hex sign to keep people
from fucking with you   
   back when a name
was to mean something 
but you re here 
shit  yeah 
i got a guy trying to walk out of
the hospital on a fried drumstick   
   because he s afraid of soze 
i ll run up the flagpole 
i came clean  i told it like it
happened on the boat 
so what if i left out
how i got there 
it s so full of holes  the d a  would have
told me to blow amnesty up my ass 
so you got what you wanted
out of me  so big fucking deal 
so that s why you
never told the d a   
well  you tell me  agent kujan   
if i told you the loch ness monster   
hired me to hit the harbor 
what would you say 
turn state s evidence  we ll put you
on the stand  we ll hear it out 
i ve got immunity now 
what can you possibly offer me 
if there really is a keyser soze 
he s gonna come looking for you 
where s your head 
agent kujan 
where do you think
the pressure s coming from 
keyser soze  or whatever
you want to call him   
   he knows where
i am right now 
he s got the front burner
under your ass to let me go   
   so he can scoop me up
10 minutes later 
immunity was just a
deal with you assholes 
i ve got a whole new
problem when i post bail 
so why play into his hands 
we can protect you 
oh  gee  thanks dave  bang up job so far   
   extortion 
coersion   
   you probably pardon me
if i ask you to kiss my pucker 
the same fuckers that rounded
this up and sank us into this mess   
   are now bailing me out 
fuck you 
you think you can
catch keyser soze 
you think a guy like that comes
this close to getting caught   
   and sticks his head out 
if he comes up for anything 
it will be to get rid of me 
and after that   
   my guess is you ll never
hear from him again 
what happened next 
we woke up next morning
and fenster was gone 
he couldn t handle the
idea of slumming for soze 
he left us a note
wishing us good luck   
   and took a chunk of the
money we d scraped together 
then what 
mcmanus was furious 
he was talking about tracking him
down and ripping his heart out   
   and all sorts of shit 
that night we got the call 
what call 
kobayashi told us
where we could find fenster 
all right  let s get
the fuck out of here 
we ve got to bury him 
with what 
with our hands 
oh  this is nuts 
it s dry fucking sand 
mcmanus  when he rots   
   the surfers are gonna
smell him a mile away 
dig  you fucker 
hey  what are we going to do 
this fucking guy is gonna kill us 
i don t know you 
peg leg  but i can run 
i got no problem with that 
kobayashi doesn t seem to have
a problem with that either 
you run  i won t be digging
a hole for you  you got that 
this ain t my boy we re burying 
i don t owe anybody 
fuck you 
he was my partner
for 5 years 
we did more jobs  and i saw more
money  than you can ever count 
so fuck you 
 cause now it s payback 
it s not payback 
it s precaution  you want payback 
you wanna run  i don t care 
i m not doing this for fenster 
i m not doing it for you 
i m doing this for me 
i m going to finish this thing 
this kobayashi bastard
is not going to stand on me 
and after they killed fenster 
nobody would run 
i wanted to  i thought
we could make it 
why didn t you say anything 
believe me  i tried 
but keaton wouldn t have it 
it was too far fetched for him 
keaton was a grounded guy 
an ex cop 
to a cop the explanation is never
that complicated  it s always simple 
there s no mistery to the street 
no arch criminal behind it all 
if you got a dead body
and you think his brother did it   
   you re going to find out you re right 
nobody argued with keaton 
they just set their minds to whacking kobayashi 
they re coming up 
you hear me 
he s coming up 
he s on his way down 
don t move 
press twenty 
do it now 
move 
the answer is no 
mr  soze will be most up  
listen  you cocksucker 
there is no keyser soze 
you mention his name again 
i ll kill you right now 
strange threat  mr  keaton  i can only assume
you ve come here to kill me anyway 
we know that you
can get to us 
but now you know
that we can get to you 
i m giving you one last
chance to call this off 
mr  so  
my employer has made up
his mind  he does not change it 
neither do we 
you got fenster 
but you won t get all of us 
not before one of us
gets through to you 
i believe you  mr  mcmanus 
i most sincerely do 
you would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable 
but i cannot make
this decision 
whatever you threaten
me with is    ludicrous   
   in comparsion to what will be done to me
if i do not carry out my orders in full 
i m the guy that s
going to get you 
i just wanted you
to know that 
i m so sorry  mr  mcmanus 
i implore you  mr  keaton 
believe me 
mr  soze is very real
and very determined 
we ll see 
before you   
   do me in  mr  mcmanus   
   you ll let me finish
my business   
   with ms  finneran first 
won t you 
what did you say 
edie finneran 
she s upstairs in my office 
for an extradition deposition 
i requested she be put
on the case personally 
she flew in yesterday 
no matter 
kill away  mr  mcmanus 
you re lying 
am i 
ms  finneran s escort while
she s here in los angeles 
never leaves her
side for a moment 
i thought you d be glad
to know she s in good hands 
now get some rest  the boat
will be ready for you on friday 
if i see you or any of
your friends before then   
ms  finneran will find
herself the victim   
   of a most gruesome violation
before she dies 
as  indeed  your
father  mr  hockney   
   and your uncle randall
in arizona  mr  kint 
i might only castrate   
   mr  mcmanus  nephew  david 
do i make myself clear 
we will take care of
the two bodies downstairs 
we ll add them to
the cost of mr  fenster 
now if you ll excuse me 
gentlemen 
geez  it s a logistical nightmare 
close quarters  ten  maybe twenty men 
there s no telling how many
more are gonna be below deck 
can we stealth these guys 
no  with all that coke 
they are going to be ready 
which brings me to
sunny point number two 
even if one of us gets through and
jacks the boat  we still get nothing 
what if we wait for the money 
ten more men at least 
look  in my opinion
it can t be done 
anybody who goes in there
is not coming out alive 
i m gonna wait for the money 
me too 
did you hear
what he just said 
  if i m going in  i want a cut 
  me too 
there s nothing
that can t be done 
i just can t believe we re just
gonna walk into certain death 
news said it s raining
in new york 
what language is that 
i don t know 
russian  i think 
hungarian 
package has arrived 
you kids are ready 
i would be if i wouldn t have
to stop and answer you 
i m ready 
mcmanus  you better be
set up in ten seconds 
i m ready 
i want you to stay here 
but i m supposed to cover  
listen  if we don t get out of this
i want you to take the money and go 
find edie  tell her what
happened  tell her everything 
she knows people 
she knows what to do 
if i don t get kobayashi
my way  she ll get him her way 
just do what i say 
please 
tell her that   
tell her i tried 
mcmanus  he s on his way 
i m there 
huh  oswald was a fag 
hi 
how are you doing 
is there    a problem 
now   
old mcdonald   
   had a farm   
   ee aye  ee aye  oh 
and on that farm
he shot some guys   
   ba da boom  ba da bing 
bang boom 
elvis has left the building 
why didn t you run 
i froze up 
i thought about fenster and how
he looked when we buried him 
and i thought about keaton 
it looked like he might pull it off 
a boy came across a body on the beach
this morning  thrown clear when the boat burned   
   shot twice in the head  two guys
from the bureau just identified him 
what else 
his name was arturo marquez 
a petty smuggler from argentina 
he was arrested last year
in new york for trafficking 
he escaped to california 
they picked him up in long beach   
   they re setting up
extradition   he escapes again 
now  get this   
edie finneran is brought in
to advice in the proceedings 
kobayashi 
new york faxed me a copy
of his testimony  he was a rat 
a big fucking rat 
arturo was very opposed
to returning to prison 
so much so that he named
close to 50 people 
guess who he named in finale 
keyser soze 
there s more 
i ll tell you what i know 
stop me when this sounds familiar 
there was no dope on that boat 
stay quiet 
he s here 
i know he s here 
that s him 
i m telling you that s him 
i know he s here 
you don t understand 
that s him   
  shut up 
  that s him  you hear me 
i m telling you
it s keyser soze 
  where s hockney 
  i don t know  there s no coke 
  what 
  you heard me  you dumb fuck  there s no coke 
i checked the entire ship 
i ve been in every fucking room 
  there s gotta be coke 
  there is nothing 
nothing 
you re fucking me 
there is    no    fucking    coke 
i m outta here 
i told them nothing 
i swear 
i told them nothing 
please 
mcmanus 
what the fuck is going on 
strangest thing   
that s what you said in your statement 
 a man in a suit with a slim build  
wait a minute 
i don t have a minute 
are you saying you saw keyser soze 
you told the d a  you
didn t know who it was 
i know there was
dope on that boat 
  stop stalling  verbal 
  i m not stalling 
  you know what i m getting at 
  get out of my face 
i ve got immunity  i don t
have to take that shit 
you know    what
i m getting at  verbal 
i don t know what
you re talking about 
yes you do    the truth 
  try to tell me you saw someone kill keaton 
  i don t know what you re talking about  i did 
you re lying to me 
you know  you ve known
this whole fucking time 
i don t know what you re saying 
i did see keaton get shot  i swear to you 
then why didn t you help him 
you had a gun  why didn t you help him 
he was your friend 
because i was afraid 
ok  afraid 
afraid of what 
i know it was keyser soze 
it was keyser soze 
i mean  agent kujan  the devil himself 
how do you shoot
the devil in the back 
what if you miss 
all right 
let s get back to the pier 
arturo marquez 
ever hear of him 
what  no 
he was a stool pigeon
for the justice department 
he swore out a statement to
federal marshals saying that he had seen   
   and could positively
identify one keyser soze 
it says right here in the report 
he had intimate knowledge of his businesses   
   including  but not exclusive to   
   drug trafficking and murder 
  i never heard of him 
  his own people were selling him   
   to a gang of hungarians 
most likely the same hungarians that
soze all but wiped out back in turkey 
the money wasn t there for dope 
the hungarians were
going to buy the one guy   
   that could incriminate keyser soze 
i said i never heard of him 
but keaton did 
edie finneran was   
   marquez  extradition advisor 
she knew who he was
and what he knew 
  i don t und  
  there were no drugs on that boat 
it was a hit  a suicide mission
to whack out the one guy   
   that could finger keyser soze 
so soze put some thiefs to it 
men he knew he could
march into certain death 
you say soze sent us
to kill someone 
i m saying keaton did 
verbal  he left you
behind for a reason 
just do what i tell you 
if you all knew that soze
could find you anywhere   
   why did he give you the money to run 
he could have used you on the boat 
he wanted me to live 
a one time dirty cop
without a loyalty in the world   
   finds it that it s hard to save   
   a worthless rat cripple
no  sir 
why 
edie 
i don t buy that reform
story for a minute 
even if i did  i certainly
don t believe   
   he would send you to protect her 
so why 
because he was my friend 
no  verbal  he wasn t your friend 
keaton didn t have friends 
what are you doing here 
he saved you   
   because he wanted it that way 
it was his will 
  keaton was keyser soze 
  no 
the kind of man who could
wrangle the wills of men   
   like hockney and mcmanus 
the kind of man   
   who could engineer
a police line up   
   from all his years
of contacts in n y p d   
the kind of man that could
have killed edie finneran 
she was found yesterday
at a hotel in pennsylvania 
shot twice in the head 
what do you think
about keaton now  verbal 
  edie   
  he used all of you   
   to get him on that boat 
he couldn t get on alone   
   he had to pull the trigger himself
to make sure he got his man 
the one man that could identify him 
this is all bullshit   
you said you saw him die 
or did you 
you had to hide when you
first heard the police cars 
you said you heard
the shot before the fire 
but you didn t see him die 
i knew him 
he would never  
he programmed you 
he programmed you to tell us
just what he wanted you to 
he knew we were close 
you said it yourself 
where was the political pressure coming from 
why were you being protected 
it was keaton 
immunity was your reward 
why me 
why not fenster or
mcmanus or hockney 
why me  i m stupid 
i m a cripple  why me 
because you re
a cripple  verbal 
because you re stupid 
because you re weaker than them 
if he s dead   
   if what you say is true 
then it won t matter 
it was his idea to hit the
taxi service in new york  wasn t it 
come on  tell me
the truth 
it was all keaton 
we followed him
from the beginning 
i didn t know 
i saw him die 
i believe he s dead 
oh  christ 
you re not safe
on your own 
you think he s  
keyser soze 
i don t know  verbal 
keyser soze is a shield 
like you said  a spook story 
but i know keaton 
and someone is out there pulling strings for you 
stay here and
let us protect you 
no way  i m not bait 
i post today 
you posted 20 minutes ago 
capt  leo wants you
out of here a s a p     
     unless you turn state s 
  i ll take my chances  thank you 
if someone wants to get you   
they re gonna get you out there 
turn states evidence 
you might never see trial 
may be so 
but i m not a rat  agent kujan 
fucking cops

you have to sign for these 
one watch  gold 
one cigarette lighter  gold 
and a pack of cigarettes  thank you 
you still got nothing  dave 
i know what i wanted
to know about keaton 
just nothing 
no matter 
he ll have to know how close we came 
keyser soze or no keyser soze   
   if keaton is alive 
he s not coming up again 
i ll find him 
waste of time 
a rumor is not a rumor
that doesn t die 
what 
nothing 
man  you re a slob 
yeah  but all has a system  dave 
it all makes sense when you look at it right 
you ve got to stand back from it  you know 
you want to see a real horror show 
you should see my garage 
convince me  and tell me every last detail   
you know  back when i was in that
barber shop quartet in skokie  illinois   
where s your head  agent kujan 
what we need to do is think 
think back 
i m sure you ve heard many tall tales   
  bricks marlin 
  this isn t right 
  i just want to hear your story 
  tell me every last detail 
it s all there 
and i m telling it all straight  i swear 
  some guy in california  his name is redfoot 
  a gift   
     from mr  soze 
  talk to me  verbal 
what about redfoot 
mr  redfoot knew nothing 
     using pawns   
  big  fat guy  i mean  like orca fat 
back when i was picking beans in
guatemala  we used to make fresh coffee   
   he was a good man   
i know he was good 
tell me every last detail 
strangest thing 
how do you shoot
the devil in the back 
   this guy is protected
from up on high   
   by the prince
of darkness 
what about it  pretzel man 
what s your story 
  there was a lawyer   
  what lawyer  verbal 
i am mr  kobayashi 
tell me every last detail 
i work for keyser soze 
convince me 
every creeping scumbag that works the street
for a living will know the name of verbal kint 
the cripple 
did you see him 
the cripple 
which way did he go 
oh  he went out that way 
i know you know something 
i m smarter than you 
and i m gonna find out what i want to know   
   wether you like it or not 
to a cop the explanation is never
that complicated  it s always simple 
there s no mistery to the street 
no arch criminal behind it all 
somebody with power   
keyser soze 
you think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out 
because you re stupid  verbal 
because you re a cripple 
what i want to know
is who s the gimp 
you know 
you ve known the whole fucking time 
if he comes up for anything 
it will be to get rid of me 
i can t feel my legs    keyser 
first thing i learned on the job 
you know what it was 
he mentioned keyser soze 
who 
after that   
   my guess is you ll never
hear from him again 
the greatest trick
