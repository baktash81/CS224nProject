and that was how it started
the five of us being brought in on a trumpedup
charge to be leaned on by halfwits
ok now i really cant talk
about it much here
what the cops never figured out
and what i know now
was that these men would
never break never lie down

bodies out of the water though
any survivors

los angeles until tuesday
if you need to reach me contact
jeff rabin at the
san pedro pd at extension 112

the boogey man smacked him around
allright they take the statement
and they cut him a deal
what did they charge
him with anything

getting that much you understand

has turned political
the major was here last night the chief
this morning

up on high by the prince of darkness
take my word for it
when does he post bail
maybe two hours tops
i want to see him
no dave
i gotta see him jeffrey
dave no
i can not do this for you
i came a long way for this
dave please
even if i let you talk to him
he wont talk to you
hes paranoid about
being recorded
he knows the interrogation
rooms are wired
this wont be an interrogation
just a friendly chat
to kill some time
he will not go into
the interrogation room
just someplace else then
where
if this was a dope deal
wheres the dope
if it was a hit
who called it in
im sure you have a host of wild
theories to answer all these questions
you know damn well what i think
thats crazy
and besides it doesnt even matter
the guys got total immunity
his story checks out
he doesnt know what
you want to know
i dont think he does
not exactly
but theres a lot more
to his story believe me
jeffrey look i want to know why
27 men died on that pier
for what looks to be 91 million dollars
worth of dope that wasnt there
and above all
i want to be sure
dean keaton is dead
hes dead
cmon two hours
just till he makes bail
theyre all dead
i dont care how tough a guy
you say this keaton was
nobody on that boat
could have come out alive
is he talking
he regained consciousness
less than an hour ago
he spoke not english
then he lapsed
hungarian

were hungarians
youve got to put on these
burn victims are very
succeptible to infections
and of course
there is no smoking
keep your mask up
please dont touch him
is he gonna die

its never going to stop
i love you
they ruined me in there tonight
i love you
do you hear me
what
all right
lets just go to my place
well worry about this tomorrow
fenster and mcmanus had a cagey proposition
a fast jump high risk
long money
we all knew it could be done
the way i figured
to do it wrong meant killing
to do it right took five men
five men meant keaton
keaton took convincing
new york finest taxi service
bullshit
they dont operate anymore
mcmanus has a friend in the 14th precinct
theyre coming out for one job  thursday
they are picking up a guy smuggling
emeralds out of south america
mcmanus already has a fence
set to take the stuff
a fence who
some guy in california
his name is redfoot
i never heard of him
you have to come
whats it to you
wether i do it not
they
they dont know me you do
they wont take me
unless you go
look at me
i need this
oh are you telling me
you dont need this
is this your place
im not knocking you you look like youve got
a good little scam going on with this lawyer
sorry
its ok
you say its the real thing
thats cool
youre ok
i was out of line
but theyre never going to stop
with us you know that
as clean as you could ever get
theyll never let you go now
this way we hit the cops where it
hurts and we get well in the mean time
you sure youre ok
ill be all right
look i
sometimes get
forget it
i probably shit blood tonight
so how do they want to do it
mcmanus wants to go in shooting
i say no
fenster
hockney
theyre pretty pissed off
theyll do anything
now ive got a way of doing
it without killing anyone
but as i said they wont
let me in without you
three million
maybe more
no killing
not if we do it my way
new yorks finest taxi service was
not your normal taxi service
it was a ring of corrupt cops in the
nypd that ran a highprofit racket
driving smugglers and drug
dealers all over the city
for a few hundred dollars a mile
you got your own blue and white
and a police escort
they even had their
own business cards
after a while somebody
started asking
questions and the
taxi service shut down
ever since then internal affairs had been
waiting to catch them in the act
and thats where we came in
so how was the flight
fucking great
will this get me to staten island
kidding me this will
get you to cape cod
mcmanus came to us with the job
fenster got the vans
hockney supplied the hardware
i came through with how
to do it so noone got killed
but keaton
keaton put on
the finishing touch
a little fuck you from the
five of us to the nypd
all right watch this
careful
asshole
dont move you fucker
who the
drop it now motherfucker

keaton made an
anonymous phone call
the press was on the scene
before the police were
strausz and rizzi were
indicted three days later
within a few weeks 50 more
cops went down with them
everybody got it right in the ass
from the chief on down
it was beautiful
i owe you 250
theres more here than i thought
when does the fence come
redfoot never comes to see me
i always go to see him

no no no
you fuckin kiddin me
ok so

my fucking problem man is that you and
fenster are off honeymooning in california
while the rest of us are
sitting here holding our dicks
hey
the jobs over
cool it
la is a good place
to lay low for a while
wanna dance
ladies
i would like to propose a toast
there you go
to mr verbal
the man with the plan
were gonna miss the flight
dont do this
send her a note  something
i said well make it
were gonna miss the plane
shell understand
thats heartwarming
really
im weepy
jeff you wanna wait outside
you guys wanted to know what happened
after the lineup im telling you
come on verbal
who do you think
youre talking to
you expect me to believe
that he retired
for a woman
bullshit
keaton was using her
he loved her
sure
im supposed to believe that hitting the
taxi service wasnt his idea either
it was all fenster and mcmanus
cmon keaton was
a cop for 4 years
who else would know the taxi service better
that job had his name written all over it
but edie had him
all turned around
let me tell you something
i know dean keaton
ive been investigating him
for the past 3 years
the guy i know was a
coldblooded bastard
iad indicted him on three counts of murder
before he was kicked off the force
so dont sell me the hooker
with the heart of gold
you got him all wrong
do i
dean keaton was under indictment a total
of 7 times while he was on the force
in every case the witnesses either
reversed their testimony to the grand jury
or died before they could testify
when they finally nailed him for fraud
he spent five years in sing sing
he killed three
prisioners inside
of course
i cant prove this
but i cant prove
the best part either
dean keaton was dead
did you know that
he died in a fire
two years ago
during an investigation into
the murder of a witness
who was going to
testify against him
two people saw dean keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned
just before it blew up
they said he went in to
check a leaking gas main
it blew up and took all
of dean keaton with it
within three months
of the explosion
the two witnesses
they were dead
one killed himself in his car
the other fell down an
open elevator shaft
agent baer
this is not what we discussed
there are far too many people in this room
look doctor i promise well be out of
here before he blows his porcelain ok
i have a noon meeting baer
agent baer five minutes
look everyone just calm down all right
i want you to ask this man about the shootout in the harbor
he says they were buying
dope we know
he doesnt know what they
were buying but not dope people
what
he needs guarantees
what is he talking about
he says his lifes in danger
he saw the devil
looked him in the eye
im on my way
no no wait a minute
ask him to tell him what he told me
about the devil
whos the devil
keyser soze
he was in the harbor
killing many men
he saw keyser soze
he saw his face
tell him to tell her what he looks like
describe him
six weeks ago i get an anonymous
phone call telling me
i could find keaton eating at mondinos
with his attourney and there he is
now because he never
profited from his alleged death
and because we convicted someone
else of the murder we tried to pin on him
we had to let him go
he was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over
and then he had lunch
i dont know about that
oh i dont think you do
but you say you saw keaton die
i think youre covering his ass
and hes still out there somewhere
i think hes behind that
whole circus at the harbor
my bet is hes using you because yourre
stupid and you think hes your friend
you tell me hes dead
so be it
i want to be sure hes dead
before i go back to new york
he wasnt behind anything
it was the lawyer
what lawyer
what lawyer verbal
you know back when i was with that
barber shop quartet in skokie illinois i
you dont think i know
you held out on the da
what did you leave
out on that testimony
i can be on the phone to
ruby deemer in ten minutes
the da gave me immunity
nos from me you get no immunity
from me you piece of shit
every criminal i have put in prison
every cop that owes me a favor
every creeping scumbag that works the street
for a living will know the name of verbal kint
now you talk to me
or that precious immunity they
seem so fit to grant you
wont be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on
there was a lawyer
kobayashi
is he the one that killed keaton
no
but im sure keaton is dead
convince me
tell me every last detail
we arrived in los angeles
and met mcmanus friends redfoot
he had a good reputation
seemed like a good guy
still we should have known better
howre you doing
good you

no need to open it right
you must be keaton
redfoot dean keaton
todd hockney and verbal kint

me that you know spook hollis

you did time with old spook
good man wasnt he
i used to run dope for him
too bad he got shivved

just out of curiosity
was it business or personal
a bit of both
well like i said you give me
a call if youre interested
is there a problem
one job that was the deal
one job
one job

keaton followed the best he could

he started talking
he was part of a hungarian mob there to do
a deal with a bunch of goats from argentina
and he says it was
definitely not a dope deal
but the 91 mill
yeah we know
our man says
no way on the dope
this hungarian tells me the whole bunch
was pulling stumps for turkey the next day
they had no time to negotiate that kind
of product and no means to move it
whats the money for
he didnt know
no one doing the deal knew
except for a few key people
they all were very hush
about it he says
whatever it was
its very sensitive
i dont get it

from new york did he mention keyser soze
who
just bear with me here
whos keyser soze
oh fuck
weve been going over this
for an hour and a half

us from new york to los angeles

i am mr kobayashi
i have been asked by my
employer to bring a proposal
to you gentlemen
what do you want
my employer requires your services gentlemen
one job one days work very dangerous
he does not expect all of you to live
but those of you who do
will have 91 million dollars
to divide between you
in any way you see fit
whos your boss
i work for keyser soze
whos keyser soze
judging by the sudden change in mood mr kint
i feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you
i come with an offer
directly from mr soze
an order actually
what do you mean an order
in 1981 mr keaton
you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in buffalo new york
the cargo was raw steel
steel which belonged to mr soze
and which was destined for pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor
a most profitable violation
of un regulations
you had no way of
knowing this mr keaton
because the fellow shipping the
steel was working for mr soze
without his knowledge
earlier this year
mr fenster and mr mcmanus hijacked a
twoprop cargo flight out of newark airport
the plane was carrying gold and platinum
wiring also set for pakistan
two months ago mr hockney
stole a truck carrying gun parts
through queens
gun parts which where set to be
destroyed by the state of new york
they would be lost in a weigh
station and rerouted to belfast
again mr soze using pawns
who had no knowledge
which brings us to mr kint
nine months ago
one of mr sozes
lessthanintelligent couriers
was taken in a complicated
confidence scanby a cripple
he was relieved of 62000 dollars
now it has taken us
some time to find you
our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in new york
you set up the lineup
yes you were not to be released
until i had come to see you
it seems mr keatons
attourney ms finneran
was a little too effective
in expediting his release
holding the rest of you
became a moot point
what about redfoot
mr redfoot knew nothing
mr soze rarely works
with the same people
for very long and they
never know who theyre working for
one cannot be betrayed
if one has no people
so why telling us
because you have stolen
from mr soze mr fenster
all of you
that you did not know
you stole from him
is the only reason
youre still alive
he feels you owe him
you will repay your debt
all right fuck the debt
and fuck you
how do we know
you work for soze
i dont think that is very
relevant mr hockney
all five of you are responsible for the
murder of saul berg and his bodyguards
mr redfoot can testify to your involvement
and we can see to it that he will
whats your point
the offer is this gentlemen
mr sozes primary interest
is narcotics
he has been competing shall we say
with a group of argentinians
for several years now
competing with mr soze
has taken its toll
these argentinians are
negotiating the sale
of 91 million dollars in
cocaine in 3 days time
needless to say this
purchase will revitalize
the diminishing strength
of their organization
mr soze would like you
to stop the deal
if you choose you may
wait until after the buy
whatever money changes hands
is yours
mr soze would like you to get to the
boat and destroy the cocaine onboard
and then you will be free of
your obligations to mr soze
you give me one good reason
why i shouldnt kill you right now
a gift
from mr soze
good day gentlemen
theyve got my whole life in here
everything ive ever done since i was 18
they fucking know everything
everybody ive ever worked
with or did time with
no this isnt right
i dont know
who was that guy who used
to talk about soze in new york
bricks marlin
yeah he did jobs for him
indirect stuff
he said he always made 5 times
more money than the job was worth
this guys a pipe dream
kobayashi is using him for window dressing
i dont know
this is bad
thats bullshit this guy could be lapd
its a fucking setup
ah the way i hear it soze
is some kind of butcher
a fearless psycho
fucked up butcher
there is no keyser soze
who is keyser soze
hes supposed to be turkish
some say his father was german
nobody ever believed
he was real
nobody ever knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him
but to hear kobayashi tell it
anybody could have worked for soze
you never knew
that was his power
the greatest trick
the devil ever pulled
was convincing the
world he didnt exist
one story the guys told me
the story i believe
was from his days in turkey
there was a gang of hungarians
that wanted their own mob
they realized that to be in power
you didnt need guns
or money or even numbers
you just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldnt
after a while they come into power
and then they come after soze
he was small time then
just running dope they say
they come to his home
in the afternoon
looking for his business
they find his wife and
kids in the house
and decide to
wait for soze
he comes home
to find his wife raped
and children screaming
the hungarians knew soze was
tough not to be trifled with
so they let him know
they meant business
they tell him they want his territory
all of his business
soze looks over the
faces of his family
then he showed these men of will
what will really was
he tells him he would
rather see his family dead
than live another
day after this
he lets the last hungarian go
he waits until his wife and kids are in the ground
and then he goes after the rest of the mob
he kills their kids he kills their wives
he kills their parents
and their parents friends
he burns down the
houses they live in
and the stores
they work in
he kills people that owe them
money and like that
hes gone
underground
nobody has ever seen him since
he becomes a myth
a spook story that criminals
tell their kids at night
rat on your pop
and keyser soze will get you
no one ever really believes
do you believe
in him verbal
keaton always said
i dont believe in god
but im afraid of him
well i believe in god
and the only thing that
scares me is keyser soze
you give any weight to this
i can introduce you to
dan metzheiser from justice
hes got a file on soze in dc
its been a hobby of his for a couple of years
a lot of guys equate him to that
reporter on the incredible hulk
youve heard of him
what on the street
a few times
outside stuff
somebody working for a guy
who works for a guy
who got some money from keyser soze
yknow shit like that
could be an old badge
a hex sign to keep people
from fucking with you
back when a name
was to mean something
but youre here
shit yeah
i got a guy trying to walk out of
the hospital on a fried drumstick
because hes afraid of soze
ill run up the flagpole
i came clean i told it like it
happened on the boat
so what if i left out
how i got there
its so full of holes the da would have
told me to blow amnesty up my ass
so you got what you wanted
out of me so big fucking deal
so thats why you
never told the da
well you tell me agent kujan
if i told you the loch ness monster
hired me to hit the harbor
what would you say
turn states evidence well put you
on the stand well hear it out
ive got immunity now
what can you possibly offer me
if there really is a keyser soze
hes gonna come looking for you
wheres your head
agent kujan
where do you think
the pressures coming from
keyser soze or whatever
you want to call him
he knows where
i am right now
hes got the front burner
under your ass to let me go
so he can scoop me up
10 minutes later
immunity was just a
deal with you assholes
ive got a whole new
problem when i post bail
so why play into his hands
we can protect you
oh gee thanks dave bangup job so far
extortion
coersion
you probably pardon me
if i ask you to kiss my pucker
the same fuckers that rounded
this up and sank us into this mess
are now bailing me out
fuck you
you think you can
catch keyser soze
you think a guy like that comes
this close to getting caught
and sticks his head out
if he comes up for anything
it will be to get rid of me
and after that
my guess is youll never
hear from him again
what happened next
we woke up next morning
and fenster was gone
he couldnt handle the
idea of slumming for soze
he left us a note
wishing us good luck
and took a chunk of the
money wed scraped together
then what
mcmanus was furious
he was talking about tracking him
down and ripping his heart out
and all sorts of shit
that night we got the call
what call
kobayashi told us
where we could find fenster
all right lets get
the fuck out of here
weve got to bury him
with what
with our hands
oh this is nuts
its dry fucking sand
mcmanus when he rots
the surfers are gonna
smell him a mile away
dig you fucker
hey what are we going to do
this fucking guy is gonna kill us
i dont know you
pegleg but i can run
i got no problem with that
kobayashi doesnt seem to have
a problem with that either
you run i wont be digging
a hole for you you got that
this aint my boy were burying
i dont owe anybody
fuck you
he was my partner
for 5 years
we did more jobs and i saw more
money than you can ever count
so fuck you
cause now its payback
its not payback
its precaution you want payback
you wanna run i dont care
im not doing this for fenster
im not doing it for you
im doing this for me
im going to finish this thing
this kobayashi bastard
is not going to stand on me
and after they killed fenster
nobody would run
i wanted to i thought
we could make it
why didnt you say anything
believe me i tried
but keaton wouldnt have it
it was too farfetched for him
keaton was a grounded guy
an excop
to a cop the explanation is never
that complicated its always simple
theres no mistery to the street
no archcriminal behind it all
if you got a dead body
and you think his brother did it
youre going to find out youre right
nobody argued with keaton
they just set their minds to whacking kobayashi
theyre coming up
you hear me
hes coming up
hes on his way down
dont move
press twenty
do it now
move
the answer is no
mr soze will be most up
listen you cocksucker
there is no keyser soze
you mention his name again
ill kill you right now
strange threat mr keaton i can only assume
youve come here to kill me anyway
we know that you
can get to us
but now you know
that we can get to you
im giving you one last
chance to call this off
mr so
my employer has made up
his mind he does not change it
neither do we
you got fenster
but you wont get all of us
not before one of us
gets through to you
i believe you mr mcmanus
i most sincerely do
you would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable
but i cannot make
this decision
whatever you threaten
me with is ludicrous
in comparsion to what will be done to me
if i do not carry out my orders in full
im the guy thats
going to get you
i just wanted you
to know that
im so sorry mr mcmanus
i implore you mr keaton
believe me
mr soze is very real
and very determined
well see
before you
do me in mr mcmanus
youll let me finish
my business
with ms finneran first
wont you
what did you say
edie finneran
shes upstairs in my office
for an extradition deposition
i requested she be put
on the case personally
she flew in yesterday
no matter
kill away mr mcmanus
youre lying
am i
ms finnerans escort while
shes here in los angeles
never leaves her
side for a moment
i thought youd be glad
to know shes in good hands
now get some rest the boat
will be ready for you on friday
if i see you or any of
your friends before then
ms finneran will find
herself the victim
of a most gruesome violation
before she dies
as indeed your
father mr hockney
and your uncle randall
in arizona mr kint
i might only castrate
mr mcmanus nephew david
do i make myself clear
we will take care of
the two bodies downstairs
well add them to
the cost of mr fenster
now if youll excuse me
gentlemen
geez its a logistical nightmare
close quarters ten maybe twenty men
theres no telling how many
more are gonna be below deck
can we stealth these guys
no with all that coke
they are going to be ready
which brings me to
sunny point number two
even if one of us gets through and
jacks the boat we still get nothing
what if we wait for the money
ten more men at least
look in my opinion
it cant be done
anybody who goes in there
is not coming out alive
im gonna wait for the money
me too
did you hear
what he just said
if im going in i want a cut
me too
theres nothing
that cant be done
i just cant believe were just
gonna walk into certain death
news said its raining
in new york
what language is that
i dont know
russian i think
hungarian
package has arrived
you kids are ready
i would be if i wouldnt have
to stop and answer you
im ready
mcmanus you better be
set up in ten seconds
im ready
i want you to stay here
but im supposed to cover
listen if we dont get out of this
i want you to take the money and go
find edie tell her what
happened tell her everything
she knows people
she knows what to do
if i dont get kobayashi
my way shell get him her way
just do what i say
please
tell her that
tell her i tried
mcmanus hes on his way
im there
huh oswald was a fag
hi
how are you doing
is there a problem
now
old mcdonald
had a farm
eeaye eeaye oh
and on that farm
he shot some guys
badaboom badabing
bangboom
elvis has left the building
why didnt you run
i froze up
i thought about fenster and how
he looked when we buried him
and i thought about keaton
it looked like he might pull it off
a boy came across a body on the beach
this morning thrown clear when the boat burned
shot twice in the head two guys
from the bureau just identified him
what else
his name was arturo marquez
a petty smuggler from argentina
he was arrested last year
in new york for trafficking
he escaped to california
they picked him up in long beach
theyre setting up
extradition  he escapes again
now get this
edie finneran is brought in
to advice in the proceedings
kobayashi
new york faxed me a copy
of his testimony he was a rat
a big fucking rat
arturo was very opposed
to returning to prison
so much so that he named
close to 50 people
guess who he named in finale
keyser soze
theres more
ill tell you what i know
stop me when this sounds familiar
there was no dope on that boat
stay quiet
hes here
i know hes here
thats him
im telling you thats him
i know hes here
you dont understand
thats him
shut up
thats him you hear me
im telling you
its keyser soze
wheres hockney
i dont know theres no coke
what
you heard me you dumb fuck theres no coke
i checked the entire ship
ive been in every fucking room
theres gotta be coke
there is nothing
nothing
youre fucking me
there is no fucking coke
im outta here
i told them nothing
i swear
i told them nothing
please
mcmanus
what the fuck is going on
strangest thing
thats what you said in your statement
a man in a suit with a slim build
wait a minute
i dont have a minute
are you saying you saw keyser soze
you told the da you
didnt know who it was
i know there was
dope on that boat
stop stalling verbal
im not stalling
you know what im getting at
get out of my face
ive got immunity i dont
have to take that shit
you know what
im getting at verbal
i dont know what
youre talking about
yes you do the truth
try to tell me you saw someone kill keaton
i dont know what youre talking about i did
youre lying to me
you know youve known
this whole fucking time
i dont know what youre saying
i did see keaton get shot i swear to you
then why didnt you help him
you had a gun why didnt you help him
he was your friend
because i was afraid
ok afraid
afraid of what
i know it was keyser soze
it was keyser soze
i mean agent kujan the devil himself
how do you shoot
the devil in the back
what if you miss
all right
lets get back to the pier
arturo marquez
ever hear of him
what no
he was a stool pigeon
for the justice department
he swore out a statement to
federal marshals saying that he had seen
and could positively
identify one keyser soze
it says right here in the report
he had intimate knowledge of his businesses
including but not exclusive to
drug trafficking and murder
i never heard of him
his own people were selling him
to a gang of hungarians
most likely the same hungarians that
soze all but wiped out back in turkey
the money wasnt there for dope
the hungarians were
going to buy the one guy
that could incriminate keyser soze
i said i never heard of him
but keaton did
edie finneran was
marquez extradition advisor
she knew who he was
and what he knew
i dont und
there were no drugs on that boat
it was a hit a suicide mission
to whack out the one guy
that could finger keyser soze
so soze put some thiefs to it
men he knew he could
march into certain death
you say soze sent us
to kill someone
im saying keaton did
verbal he left you
behind for a reason
just do what i tell you
if you all knew that soze
could find you anywhere
why did he give you the money to run
he could have used you on the boat
he wanted me to live
a one time dirty cop
without a loyalty in the world
finds it that its hard to save
a worthless ratcripple
no sir
why
edie
i dont buy that reform
story for a minute
even if i did i certainly
dont believe
he would send you to protect her
so why
because he was my friend
no verbal he wasnt your friend
keaton didnt have friends
what are you doing here
he saved you
because he wanted it that way
it was his will
keaton was keyser soze
no
the kind of man who could
wrangle the wills of men
like hockney and mcmanus
the kind of man
who could engineer
a police lineup
from all his years
of contacts in nypd
the kind of man that could
have killed edie finneran
she was found yesterday
at a hotel in pennsylvania
shot twice in the head
what do you think
about keaton now verbal
edie
he used all of you
to get him on that boat
he couldnt get on alone
he had to pull the trigger himself
to make sure he got his man
the one man that could identify him
this is all bullshit
you said you saw him die
or did you
you had to hide when you
first heard the police cars
you said you heard
the shot before the fire
but you didnt see him die
i knew him
he would never
he programmed you
he programmed you to tell us
just what he wanted you to
he knew we were close
you said it yourself
where was the political pressure coming from
why were you being protected
it was keaton
immunity was your reward
why me
why not fenster or
mcmanus or hockney
why me im stupid
im a cripple why me
because youre
a cripple verbal
because youre stupid
because youre weaker than them
if hes dead
if what you say is true
then it wont matter
it was his idea to hit the
taxi service in new york wasnt it
come on tell me
the truth
it was all keaton
we followed him
from the beginning
i didnt know
i saw him die
i believe hes dead
oh christ
youre not safe
on your own
you think hes
keyser soze
i dont know verbal
keyser soze is a shield
like you said a spook story
but i know keaton
and someone is out there pulling strings for you
stay here and
let us protect you
no way im not bait
i post today
you posted 20 minutes ago
capt leo wants you
out of here asap
unless you turn states
ill take my chances thank you
if someone wants to get you
theyre gonna get you out there
turn states evidence
you might never see trial
may be so
but im not a rat agent kujan
fucking cops
excuse me
can i use your fax machine
you have to sign for these
one watch gold
one cigarette lighter gold
and a pack of cigarettes thank you
you still got nothing dave
i know what i wanted
to know about keaton
just nothing
no matter
hell have to know how close we came
keyser soze or no keyser soze
if keaton is alive
hes not coming up again
ill find him
waste of time
a rumor is not a rumor
that doesnt die
what
nothing
man youre a slob
yeah but all has a system dave
it all makes sense when you look at it right
youve got to stand back from it you know
you want to see a real horror show
you should see my garage
convince me and tell me every last detail
you know back when i was in that
barber shop quartet in skokie illinois
wheres your head agent kujan
what we need to do is think
think back
im sure youve heard many tall tales
bricks marlin
this isnt right
i just want to hear your story
tell me every last detail
its all there
and im telling it all straight i swear
some guy in california his name is redfoot
a gift
from mr soze
talk to me verbal
what about redfoot
mr redfoot knew nothing
using pawns
big fat guy i mean like orcafat
back when i was picking beans in
guatemala we used to make fresh coffee
he was a good man
i know he was good
tell me every last detail
strangest thing
how do you shoot
the devil in the back
this guy is protected
from up on high
by the prince
of darkness
what about it pretzelman
whats your story
there was a lawyer
what lawyer verbal
i am mr kobayashi
tell me every last detail
i work for keyser soze
convince me
every creeping scumbag that works the street
for a living will know the name of verbal kint
the cripple
did you see him
the cripple
which way did he go
oh he went out that way
i know you know something
im smarter than you
and im gonna find out what i want to know
wether you like it or not
to a cop the explanation is never
that complicated its always simple
theres no mistery to the street
no archcriminal behind it all
somebody with power
keyser soze
you think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out
because youre stupid verbal
because youre a cripple
what i want to know
is whos the gimp
you know
youve known the whole fucking time
if he comes up for anything
it will be to get rid of me
i cant feel my legs keyser
first thing i learned on the job
you know what it was
he mentioned keyser soze
who
after that
my guess is youll never
hear from him again
the greatest trick
