the south 
have been taught from birth
a few things
which we hold above all else 
now one of the first
of these things
is that only a life could pay
for the life it takes 
now i know there s not a man
on this jury
or a man in mississippi
that in his heart
can find my client  bookwright 
guilty for defending
his daughter
against a rascal like
buck thorpe 
and that s what
i m talking about 
not about the dead man 
character 
or the morality of the act
he was engaged in 
not about self defense
or whether or not
the defendant was justified
to the point of taking a life 
but about all of us
who are not dead 
human beings  who at the bottom 
just wanna do right 
human beings 
with all the complexities
of human passion 
instincts  beliefs 
thank you  gentlemen 
thank you  your honor 
court recessed
until jury returns 
don t you agree 
he had the pistol in his hand
when they found him 
buck thorpe deserves
what he got 
i tell you  i wouldn t of waited
as long as bookwright did 
he was not only no good 
but dangerous 
right  right 
and if it hadn t
been bookwright 
someone  sooner or later 
would have to kill him 
yes 
then what do you want 
what do you want 
i can t help it 
i ain t gonna vote
bookwright free 
and so jackson fentry 
cotton farmer 
hung my jury 
who was he 
i thought he d farmed
one place all his life 
but i discovered
that 20 years ago 
he left for a job 
his neighbors told me 
you see  that was my first case
and i had to find out
why i d lost it 
good luck to you  fentry 
if any of us had known
then what i know now 
jackson fentry never
would ve been on that jury 
  my heart is sad  
  my soul is weary  
  while sailing o er  
  life s rugged plain  
  the clouds are dark  
  the day is dreary  
   unintelligible lyrics   
  angel rock me to sleep  
  angel rock me to sleep  
  in the cradle of love  
  in the cradle of love  
  bear me over the deep  
  bear me over the deep  
  to the heavens above  
  to the heavens above  
  when the shadows shall fall  
  when the shadows shall fall  
  and the savior shall call  
  and the savior shall call  
  angel rock me to sleep  
  angel rock me to sleep  
  in the cradle of love  
  in the cradle of love

i got mine  too 
i don t care a whole lot
for the winter time  do you

i always get sick
every winter time
it seems like to me 
a woman came over
to where i was staying 
she said   you look poorly 
you ought to get a doctor  
i said   there ain t
nothin  wrong with me
that sunshine
couldn t fix   i said 
you want me to put
some more wood on the fire 
no  it s just fine 
i love sunshine 
when i started out this mornin  
i said   i m goin  
if my strength holds up 
till i come to where it s warm 
when the sun is shinin   
the strength didn t hold out
very long 
listen to that wind 
i love to hear it

you re listenin  to it 
when i was a little girl 
at ten  my mama died 
they say i got everything
mixed up that year
 cause i grieved so 
i d wake all winter long 
when the wind would blow
around the house 
i d think it was
my mama callin  
and i d answer
and call back to her 
i d ask her where
she was hidin  
i never grieved no more
after that 
when i got over that  i vowed
nothin  would break my heart
ever again 
and it didn t for the longest
kind of time 
0oo 
oh  hello  fentry 
hello 
i thought you were going
to your farm for christmas 
  i changed my mind

you want to buy 
how much will four cents get me 
i d say this would do it 
give me four cents worth 
thank you 
merry christmas 
mister 
yes 
how long i been asleep 
about ten hours 
ten hours 
yes 
why didn t you wake me 
i figured the sleep
would be good for you 
my heavens 
it s still cold out yonder 
yes  it is 
why don t you stay on here
the rest of the night 
well  
i could make me a pallet
on the floor  here  by the fire 
well  thank you 
i wouldn t want
to put you out any 
you wouldn t be puttin  me out 
i went to the store 
i bought you this 
i thought you might like it 
i sure do  thank you 
it s hard candy 
well  i declare 
merry christmas 
thank you 
and a merry christmas
to you  too 
if i fixed you something
to eat now  would you eat it 
no  i m still not hungry 
i just have a taste
of my christmas  
what are you cryin  for  lady 
i don t know 
i m just tired
and nervous  i guess 
i ve been cryin  a lot lately 
it don t mean nothin  
i quit as soon as i stop 
but see  i never
used to cry before 
when i was a girl 
everybody used to accuse me
of being hard hearted because
nothing could get me to cry 
my papa told me i had to leave
home after i married my husband 
i didn t shed a tear  i just
said   that s how it has to be 
that s how it has to be  
but lately  that s all changed 
somebody d come up to me
and they d say   good morning  
or  good evening   and i ll cry 
they ll ask me what time
it is and i ll cry 
did you ever hear
of anything like that 
i didn t used to
talk this way either 
i used to be able
to go a whole day
without saying a word 
now i can t stand
if it s silent or quiet 
oh  this is so good 
will you have some 
no  thank you 
it s gonna be a clear night 
yes 
stars 
yes 
why don t you stay on out here
till after your baby is born 
i have enough to eat
for the both 
warm and dry here 
oh  mr  fentry  i don t think  
you don t have to answer me now 
you just think it over 
yes  sir 
mr  fentry 
good morning 
morning 
how are you feelin  
better  thank you 
  it s still christmas  ain t it 
  yes  ma am 
well  i hope i hadn t slept
clear through christmas 
it s a pretty day for christmas 
i m feelin  stronger 
now  let me finish doin  that 
no  ma am  you rest on today 
you can do it tomorrow 
ain t you hungry 
no 
not too hungry 
i bet you will be  though 
once you re rested 
it s rained every blessed day
for a month 
when i was a girl 
i had my own tub
to catch rainwater 
i liked to wash my hair
with rainwater 
it made it soft 
can you swim 
  no 
  i can t either 
good thing we don t live
on the delta 
we d have to get
on top of this house
and float away 
in case it flooded 
well  i don t think i care
to travel by water 
i think i d always want to be
where i can feel
the ground under my feet 
jesus walked on water  they say 
do you believe that 
i knew a preacher once 
he swore it was true 
and he said he s
gonna do it  too 
a whole crowd of folks
went down to watch him 
and he sank to the bottom 
they say god s going to destroy
the world next time by fire 
so i guess
we don t have to worry
about this rain bein 
the end of the world 
i used to not sleep some nights
just worrying about what i d do
when the world would come
to an end 
and what it would be like 
i don t worry about that
no more 
you re not gettin  cold 
are you 
oh  no 
it s much warmer today 
it ll be spring
before we know it 
i ll have had my baby by then 
i wonder where i ll be
after it s spring 
i wonder if it s gonna be
a boy or a girl 
marry me  sarah 
well  i can t marry you 
mr  fentry 
i ve got a husband 
it s against the law
to marry into   
you re gonna stay on here 
i hope to 
mr  russell said he s gonna
build me a house 
when you re strong 
i ll show you the place
i ve got picked out 
is it far from here 
no 
i d like to go and see it 
oh 
what a pretty place for a house 
did you ever build
a house before 
no 
well  how are you
gonna build this one 
mr  russell and his
boy ll help me 
there s a house in jefferson
we used to pass
goin  into town every saturday 
i used to like to think
i d like to live
in a house like that  someday 
what kind of house was it 
oh  it was a fine house 
it was painted white 
it had a gallery all along
the front and the side 
there were oak trees
in the yard 
it always looked so peaceful
when we passed by 
i never saw nobody
goin  in or out 
i asked my papa   what kind
of people live in there  
 no better than you   he said 
and he hit me 
i never knew why he hit me 
it would be nice
when you have your house
if you had some of them trees
in your yard 
papa didn t have any trees
in our yard 
there s no trees  no flowers 
there s no grass 
there s nothin  
i love grass 
and flowers  and trees 
i love honey suckle
and forget me not 
and roses  all kinds of roses 
one day we can ride
into jefferson
and see that house 
maybe 
i hate to see the sun
go behind the clouds 
better be gettin  back 
i was on my way to the store 
and mr  kent russell asked me
to do a favor for him
while i was that way 
the fellow i had to see
wasn t home 
so i had to wait for him 
that s how come i took so long 
you d better get on back
in the house 
it s cold out today 
are you warmer in here 
yes  sir 
i don t think this winter s
ever gonna end  do you 
yes  ma am  it ll end one day 
i hope i didn t cause you
to worry 
oh  i ll find a way to worry 
i guess 
there s nothin  you can do
about that 
i didn t know
why you were gone so long 
 how far is that store   i said 
i thought   he s just tired
of me bein  out here 
maybe i m too much trouble  
i m down one day
and i m up the next 
but that s not like mr  fentry  
i said 
then i thought 
 well  what if my time comes
and he ain t here yet  
i began to wonder what i d do
if i had to have a baby out here
all by myself 
you left me
plenty of stove wood 
i saw that right away

that you d gone off 
it s just that it got
so quiet here 
and i

daddy 
jackson and longstreet 
jackson and longstreet 
jackson and longstreet 
fentry  fentry  stop it 
now  there ain t
nothin  you can do 
for now they got the law
on their side 
daddy 
daddy 
i want daddy 
no  no 
i wanna stay 
they can take the boy  fentry 
it s the law 
her husband  he s still alive
and he gave the boy to them 
i didn t want to bring
them here  fentry 
but the sheriff said if i didn t
he d find you 
i know  i ve been expectin  it 
i reckon that s why
it took me so by surprise 
i m all right now 
we re sorry for it 
but he s our kin 
we want him home 
here 
here s some money
for your trouble 
they re gone 
the sheriff  he came with them
to the saw mill  fentry 
he had a paper 
look  fentry 
there s two sides to the law 
we ll go into town 
seek colonel douglas 
my pa knows him 
look  fentry  i ll go will ya 
i ll ask him to take care
of it for you 
fentry 
my search was almost over
when i find out they
took the boy 
left the county with him 
and raised him as a thorpe 
and it seemed to me 
as if i d never known before 
that this world isn t run
like it ought to be run 
fentry didn t hear
anymore of the boy
and as far as i could learn
he never mentioned
his name again 
fentry s father died
and he worked the place alone 
and then one day
a young man named buck thorpe
appeared in frenchman s bend 
when thorpe tried to run away
with h t  bookwright s daughter 
bookwright warned him
that he would protect her 
and he solved that problem
in the best of his
abilities and beliefs
asking the help of no man 
and then abode by his decision 
buck thorpe had been
in a lot of trouble 
there was talk
of his killin  a man
himself in memphis 
we know he was a brawler 
he was a drinker
and a cattle thief 
buck thorpe deserved
what he got 
i would ve shot him
if it had been my kid 
i tell ya 
i wouldn t have waited
as long as bookwright did 
he was not only no good 
but dangerous 
yes  sir 
then what do you want 
what do you want 
i can t help it 
i ain t gonna vote
bookwright free 
i declare a mistrial 
of course fentry wasn t
gonna vote bookwright free
because somewhere
in buck thorpe the adult 
the man that bookwright slew 
there still remained
at least a memory
of that little boy 
that jackson and longstreet 
i could have never have guessed 
fentry s capacity for love 
i suppose i had figured that
comin  from where he came from
that even the comprehension
of love had been
lost out of him
back down the generations
where the first fentry had
to take his final choice
between the pursuit of love
and the pursuit
of keepin  on breathin  
the lowly and the invincible
of the earth to endure
