the south
have been taught from birth
a few things
which we hold above all else
now one of the first
of these things
is that only a life could pay
for the life it takes
now i know theres not a man
on this jury
or a man in mississippi
that in his heart
can find my client bookwright
guilty for defending
his daughter
against a rascal like
buck thorpe
and thats what
im talking about
not about the dead man
character
or the morality of the act
he was engaged in
not about self defense
or whether or not
the defendant was justified
to the point of taking a life
but about all of us
who are not dead
human beings who at the bottom
just wanna do right
human beings
with all the complexities
of human passion
instincts beliefs
thank you gentlemen
thank you your honor
court recessed
until jury returns
dont you agree
he had the pistol in his hand
when they found him
buck thorpe deserves
what he got
i tell you i wouldnt of waited
as long as bookwright did
he was not only no good
but dangerous
right right
and if it hadnt
been bookwright
someone sooner or later
would have to kill him
yes
then what do you want
what do you want
i cant help it
i aint gonna vote
bookwright free
and so jackson fentry
cotton farmer
hung my jury
who was he
i thought hed farmed
one place all his life
but i discovered
that 20 years ago
he left for a job
his neighbors told me
you see that was my first case
and i had to find out
why id lost it
good luck to you fentry
if any of us had known
then what i know now
jackson fentry never
wouldve been on that jury
my heart is sad
my soul is weary
while sailing oer
lifes rugged plain
the clouds are dark
the day is dreary
unintelligible lyrics
angel rock me to sleep
angel rock me to sleep
in the cradle of love
in the cradle of love
bear me over the deep
bear me over the deep
to the heavens above
to the heavens above
when the shadows shall fall
when the shadows shall fall
and the savior shall call
and the savior shall call
angel rock me to sleep
angel rock me to sleep
in the cradle of love
in the cradle of love

when the wind would blow
around the house
id think it was
my mama callin

and call back to her
id ask her where
she was hidin
i never grieved no more
after that
when i got over that i vowed
nothin would break my heart
ever again

kind of time
0oo
oh hello fentry
hello
i thought you were going
to your farm for christmas
i changed my mind
well where are you goin

how much is that hard candy
well it depends on how much
you want to buy
how much will four cents get me
id say this would do it
give me four cents worth
thank you
merry christmas
mister
yes
how long i been asleep
about ten hours
ten hours
yes
why didnt you wake me
i figured the sleep
would be good for you
my heavens
its still cold out yonder
yes it is
why dont you stay on here
the rest of the night
well
i could make me a pallet
on the floor here by the fire
well thank you
i wouldnt want
to put you out any
you wouldnt be puttin me out
i went to the store
i bought you this
i thought you might like it
i sure do thank you
its hard candy
well i declare
merry christmas
thank you
and a merry christmas
to you too
if i fixed you something
to eat now would you eat it
no im still not hungry
i just have a taste
of my christmas
what are you cryin for lady
i dont know
im just tired
and nervous i guess
ive been cryin a lot lately
it dont mean nothin
i quit as soon as i stop
but see i never
used to cry before
when i was a girl
everybody used to accuse me
of being hard hearted because
nothing could get me to cry
my papa told me i had to leave
home after i married my husband
i didnt shed a tear i just
said thats how it has to be
thats how it has to be
but lately thats all changed
somebodyd come up to me
and theyd say good morning
or good evening and ill cry
theyll ask me what time
it is and ill cry
did you ever hear
of anything like that
i didnt used to
talk this way either
i used to be able
to go a whole day
without saying a word
now i cant stand
if its silent or quiet
oh this is so good
will you have some
no thank you
its gonna be a clear night
yes
stars
yes
why dont you stay on out here
till after your baby is born
i have enough to eat
for the both
warm and dry here
oh mr fentry i dont think
you dont have to answer me now
you just think it over
yes sir
mr fentry
good morning
morning
how are you feelin
better thank you
its still christmas aint it
yes maam
well i hope i hadnt slept
clear through christmas
its a pretty day for christmas
im feelin stronger
now let me finish doin that
no maam you rest on today
you can do it tomorrow
aint you hungry
no
not too hungry
i bet you will be though
once youre rested
its rained every blessed day
for a month
when i was a girl
i had my own tub
to catch rainwater
i liked to wash my hair
with rainwater
it made it soft
can you swim
no
i cant either
good thing we dont live
on the delta
wed have to get
on top of this house
and float away
in case it flooded
well i dont think i care
to travel by water
i think id always want to be
where i can feel
the ground under my feet
jesus walked on water they say
do you believe that
i knew a preacher once
he swore it was true
and he said hes
gonna do it too
a whole crowd of folks
went down to watch him
and he sank to the bottom
they say gods going to destroy
the world next time by fire
so i guess
we dont have to worry
about this rain bein
the end of the world
i used to not sleep some nights
just worrying about what id do
when the world would come
to an end
and what it would be like
i dont worry about that
no more
youre not gettin cold
are you
oh no
its much warmer today
itll be spring
before we know it
ill have had my baby by then
i wonder where ill be
after its spring
i wonder if its gonna be
a boy or a girl
marry me sarah
well i cant marry you
mr fentry
ive got a husband
its against the law
to marry into
youre gonna stay on here
i hope to
mr russell said hes gonna
build me a house
when youre strong
ill show you the place
ive got picked out
is it far from here
no
id like to go and see it
oh
what a pretty place for a house
did you ever build
a house before
no
well how are you
gonna build this one
mr russell and his
boyll help me
theres a house in jefferson
we used to pass
goin into town every saturday
i used to like to think
id like to live
in a house like that someday
what kind of house was it
oh it was a fine house
it was painted white
it had a gallery all along
the front and the side
there were oak trees
in the yard
it always looked so peaceful
when we passed by
i never saw nobody
goin in or out
i asked my papa what kind
of people live in there
no better than you he said
and he hit me
i never knew why he hit me
it would be nice
when you have your house
if you had some of them trees
in your yard
papa didnt have any trees
in our yard
theres no trees no flowers
theres no grass
theres nothin
i love grass
and flowers and trees
i love honey suckle
and forgetmenot
and roses all kinds of roses
one day we can ride
into jefferson
and see that house
maybe
i hate to see the sun
go behind the clouds
better be gettin back
i was on my way to the store
and mr kent russell asked me
to do a favor for him
while i was that way
the fellow i had to see
wasnt home
so i had to wait for him
thats how come i took so long
youd better get on back
in the house
its cold out today
are you warmer in here
yes sir
i dont think this winters
ever gonna end do you

i hope i didnt cause you
to worry
oh ill find a way to worry
i guess
theres nothin you can do
about that
i didnt know
why you were gone so long
how far is that store i said
i thought hes just tired
of me bein out here
maybe im too much trouble
im down one day
and im up the next

its the law
her husband hes still alive
and he gave the boy to them
i didnt want to bring

i reckon thats why
it took me so by surprise
im all right now
were sorry for it
but hes our kin
we want him home

for your trouble
theyre gone
the sheriff he came with them
to the saw mill fentry
he had a paper
look fentry
theres two sides to the law
well go into town
seek colonel douglas
my pa knows him
look fentry ill go will ya
ill ask him to take care
of it for you
fentry
my search was almost over
when i find out they
took the boy
left the county with him
and raised him as a thorpe
and it seemed to me
as if id never known before
that this world isnt run
like it ought to be run
fentry didnt hear
anymore of the boy
and as far as i could learn
he never mentioned
his name again
fentrys father died
and he worked the place alone
and then one day
a young man named buck thorpe
appeared in frenchmans bend
when thorpe tried to run away
with ht bookwrights daughter
bookwright warned him
that he would protect her
and he solved that problem
in the best of his
abilities and beliefs
asking the help of no man
and then abode by his decision
buck thorpe had been
in a lot of trouble
there was talk
of his killin a man
himself in memphis
we know he was a brawler
he was a drinker
and a cattle thief
buck thorpe deserved
what he got
i wouldve shot him
if it had been my kid
i tell ya
i wouldnt have waited
as long as bookwright did
he was not only no good
but dangerous
yes sir
then what do you want
what do you want
i cant help it
i aint gonna vote
bookwright free
i declare a mistrial
of course fentry wasnt
gonna vote bookwright free
because somewhere
in buck thorpe the adult
the man that bookwright slew
there still remained
at least a memory
of that little boy
that jackson and longstreet
i could have never have guessed
fentrys capacity for love
i suppose i had figured that
comin from where he came from
that even the comprehension
of love had been
lost out of him
back down the generations
where the first fentry had
to take his final choice
between the pursuit of love
and the pursuit
of keepin on breathin
the lowly and the invincible
of the earth to endure
