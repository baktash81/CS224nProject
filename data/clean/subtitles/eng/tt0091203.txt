i knew you guys were bottle fed 
yeah  well  there s not a hell of a lot
i can do about it  pal

as you complain endlessly

stuffed with meat and barley 
  and what do you do with it 
  you eat it 
how revolting 
be still for god s
sake  you ll tip us over 
so 
i cannot swim  you spanish peacock 
i m not spanish  i m egyptian 
you said you were from spain 
you are a liar

crude and slow  clansman  your attack
was no better than that of a clumsy child 
this cannot be 
it s the devil s work 
you cannot die  macleod  accept it 
  i hate you 
  good 
that is a perfect way to start 
tell me  how did it happen for god s sake 
why does the sun come up  hmm 
or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night  who knows 
what i do know is that
because you were born different 
men will fear you  try to drive you away 
like the people of your village 
you must learn to conceal your special gift
and harness your power
until the time of the gathering 
what gathering 
when only a few of us are left 
we will feel an irresistible pull
towards a faraway land
to fight for the prize 
come on 
faster 
never lose your temper 
if your head comes away from your neck 
it s over 
never overextend your thrust 
you re vulnerable and off balance 
connor 
heather  please 
if it came down to just us two 
would you take my head 
we must fight until only one remains 
you re safe only on holy ground 
none of us will violate that law 
it s tradition 
now for the last 
trust me 
let yourself feel the stag 
his heart    beating 
his blood   
coursing 
feel 
  come on 
  i feel him 
macleod  come on 
  i feel him 
  come on 
i feel him 
come on  haggis 
macleod  this is the quickening 
  yeah 
  yes 
now  pendejo  shall we see
what sort of swordsman you ve become 
en garde 
very good 
give me your hand  brother 
that one there  how much is it 
put him in 
but what i want is a family 
you cannot have a family 
we cannot have children 
that won t please heather 
i ll tell you that for nothing 
he s full of life 
connor 
here s dinner 
i ll be off now 
i fancy buying myself a new dress 
oh  you little devils  go on 
she is beautiful 
you must leave her  brother 
macleod 
i was born 2 437 years ago 
in that time i ve had 3 wives 
the last was shakiko 
a japanese princess 
her father  masamune  a genius 
made this for me 
in 593 b c 
it is the only one of its kind 
like his daughter 
when shakiko died  i was shattered 
i would save you that pain 
please  let heather go 
when we first met  you felt ill  remember 
that wasn t the first time
you felt that sensation  was it 
no 
when the macleods fought the frasers 
and a black knight   
i felt it then 
only it was different  more painful 
that black knight was the kurgan 
it s because of him that i sought you out 
who is the kurgan 
and where does he come from 
the kurgans were an ancient people
from the steppes of russia 
for amusement they tossed children into
pits with hungry dogs to fight for meat 
the kurgan  he is the strongest
of all the immortals 
he is the perfect warrior 
if he wins the prize  mortal man
would suffer an eternity of darkness 
how do you fight such a savage 
with heart  faith and steel 
in the end  there can be only one 
it must have been very dangerous for you 
well  i was very much in love with her 
my dear heather 
she was the only thing on my mind 
not danger 
so  holding the rose in my teeth 
i climbed up on the rooftop 
lowered a rope and swung in
through the open window 
  unfortunately  the lady was no longer there 
  what did you do 
i introduced myself to
the lady thatwas there 
she was most helpful 
would you like some more wine 
yes  please 
  heather  get out 
  what s wrong 
get out 
kurgan 
ramírez 
the highlander  where is he 
  you re too late  i ve prepared him for you 
  you waste your time 
it hurts 
now you die 
you cannot win  ramírez  i m the strongest 
my cut has improved your voice 
yes 
hurts 
who is the woman 
she s mine 
not for much longer 
tonight you sleep in hell 
there can be only one 
hello  pretty 
i d like to speak to russell nash 
oh  i m sorry  mr  nash isn t here
at the moment 
may i call him at home 
i have to talk to him today 
i m afraid that won t be possible 
  good morning 
  this is brenda wyatt  mr  nash 
we ve already met  rachel 
what can i do for you 
i d like some advice 
are you the kind of woman
who takes advice 
  that depends 
  advice about what 
what can you tell me about a 7  lunatic
hacking away with a broadsword
at 1 o clock in the morning
in ney york city  1985 
not much 
what about a japanese sword
dated 600 b c  
the metal in the blade folded 200 times 
i don t deal in exotic weapons 
can i show you something
in 18th century silver 
that s not why i came
here  and you know it 
  do you cook 
  why 
i thought we might have dinner 
  did you 
  yes 
so  i m standing there  and there s brenda 
our little brenda 
you re sure it was brenda 
she was in nash s shop 
she was talking to him 
  what are you looking at  rachel 
  the eyes in the back of your head 
people are asking about you 
what am i supposed to say 
tell them i m immortal 
attention  four men over here 
quiet 
don t be afraid 
  what s your name 
  rachel 
  what happened 
  everybody is dead 
i m like you  i m alone 
come with me  rachel 
  you re alive  why didn t you die 
  hey  it s a kind of magic 
  you should be dead 
  move 
no  you ll have to shoot me first 
whatever you say  jack 
you re the master race 
let s go 
that was a long time ago 
would you listen to me
for one moment  please 
you can t hide your feelings from me 
i ve known you too long 
  what feelings 
  how about loneliness 
i m not lonely 
  i ve got everything i need right here 
  oh no  you don t 
you refuse to let anyone love you 
love is for poets 
you re such a romantic  rachel 
you always were 
just a minute 
good evening 
do you want to dine in the hall 
or shall we step inside 
come in 
may i take your coat 
  no thanks 
  what 
  i ll hold on to it 
  oh  fine 
  where are you going 
  i forgot my earrings 
make yourself a drink 
there are glasses in the bar 
do you know what you re doing 
i like your place  brenda 
i ve only been here 3 months 
i m still cleaning it up 
  interesting view 
  what did you say 
i said   interesting view  
isn t it great 
you never told me what you do for a living 
i work for the metropolitan museum 
in aquisitions 
that explains your interest
in ancient weapons 
right 
especially the samurai 
very nice 
  shall we have a toast 
  yes 
brandy 
bottled in 1783 
wow  that s old 
1783 was a very good year 
mozart wrote his great mass 
the montgolfier brothers went up
in their first balloon 
and england recognized
the independence of the united states 
is that right 
yes 
what s that 
  it s for you 
  can i open it 
if you like 
you bastard  where did you find this 
i have an extensive library 
odd thing  your bio
doesn t mention the met 
it says you work for
the police  in forensics 
  are you and moran trying to set me up 
  i don t work for moran 
then why is that bald policeman sitting
outside watching your apartment 
you remember him 
moran s had him tailing me 
what re you gonna do 
the question is what are you gonna do 
you re going to turn off the tape
or you re going to shoot me with the  45 
i am not looking for a killer  i am looking
for a sword  the one used on fasil 
i found pieces of it under the garden 
  i only want to see the samurai 
  why 
i told you  because it s
not supposed to exist 
i dated pieces of the blade at 600 b c 
the metal had been folded 200 times 
the japanese didn t start making
swords like that till the middle ages 
so where the hell did it come from 
if i could verify the existence
of such a weapon  it would be like   
discovering 747 a thousand years
before the wright brothers ever flew 
this is crazy 
wait a minute  nash  i want some answers 
you want 
don t you ever think about anything
except what you want 
you must leave her  brother 
heather 
heather 
connor  i m here

forever 
i want that  too 
will you do something for me  connor 
what  blossom 
in the years to come  will you light a
candle and remember me on my birthday 
aye  love

i wanted to have your children 
they would have been strong and fine 
don t see me  connor 
let me die in peace 
where are we

  i think you re crazy  kastagir 
so  the gathering is here 
  time has almost caught us  my friend

oh  yeah  yeah  he was illegitimate 
for about a minute and a half 
he died right after she did 
he died 
hello  brenda 
i did what you asked 
i spent all night going through the old
deeds to nash s house in hudson street 
all the way back back through the five previous
owners to the original guy  montague in 1796 
in all five instances 
montague through nash 
i found a death certificate for a kid
with the same name who died at birth 
years before he pretended
to sign for his inheritance 
jesus  rick  isn t there any heat in here 
no  heat is bad for the circuits 
now  just in case there s any doubt   
so what you ve got here  brenda 
is a guy who s been creeping around
since at least 1700 
pretending to croak every once in a while 
leaving all these goods to kids
who ve been corpses for years
and assuming their identities 
it s not possible

this way no one will recognize me 
i do 
  what do you want 
  your head 
and the prize 
watch 
happy halloween  ladies 
nuns  no sense of humor 
ramírez s blade did not cut deeply enough 
he was right about you  you re slime 
ramírez was an effete snob 
he died on his knees 
i took his head and raped his woman
before his blood was even cold 
i see 
ramírez lied 
she was not his woman 
she was your woman 
and she never told you 
i wonder why 
perhaps i gave her something
you never could   
and secretly she yearned for my return 
holy ground  highlander 
remember what ramírez taught you 
you can t stay in here forever 
you are weak  highlander 
you will always be weaker than i 
i ll be out front 
goodbye  macleod

i m just like you  i can love and
have children  live and grow old 
you never prepared me for that 
you spanish peacock 
patience  highlander

but it will take time 
you are generations being born and dying 
you are at one with all living things
