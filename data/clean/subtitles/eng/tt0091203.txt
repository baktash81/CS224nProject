this cannot be
its the devils work
you cannot die macleod accept it
i hate you
good
that is a perfect way to start
tell me how did it happen for gods sake
why does the sun come up hmm
or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night who knows
what i do know is that
because you were born different
men will fear you try to drive you away
like the people of your village
you must learn to conceal your special gift
and harness your power
until the time of the gathering
what gathering
when only a few of us are left
we will feel an irresistible pull
towards a faraway land
to fight for the prize
come on
faster
never lose your temper
if your head comes away from your neck
its over
never overextend your thrust
youre vulnerable and off balance
connor
heather please
if it came down to just us two
would you take my head
we must fight until only one remains
youre safe only on holy ground
none of us will violate that law
its tradition
now for the last
trust me
let yourself feel the stag
his heart beating
his blood
coursing

come on
i feel him
macleod come on
i feel him

macleod this is the quickening
yeah
yes
now pendejo shall we see
what sort of swordsman youve become
en garde
very good
give me your hand brother
that one there how much is it
put him in
but what i want is a family
you cannot have a family
we cannot have children
that wont please heather
ill tell you that for nothing
hes full of life
connor
heres dinner
ill be off now
i fancy buying myself a new dress
oh you little devils go on
she is beautiful
you must leave her brother
macleod
i was born 2437 years ago
in that time ive had 3 wives
the last was shakiko
a japanese princess
her father masamune a genius
made this for me
in 593 bc
it is the only one of its kind
like his daughter
when shakiko died i was shattered
i would save you that pain
please let heather go
when we first met you felt ill remember
that wasnt the first time
you felt that sensation was it
no
when the macleods fought the frasers
and a black knight
i felt it then
only it was different more painful
that black knight was the kurgan
its because of him that i sought you out
who is the kurgan
and where does he come from
the kurgans were an ancient people
from the steppes of russia
for amusement they tossed children into
pits with hungry dogs to fight for meat
the kurgan he is the strongest
of all the immortals
he is the perfect warrior
if he wins the prize mortal man
would suffer an eternity of darkness
how do you fight such a savage
with heart faith and steel
in the end there can be only one
it must have been very dangerous for you
well i was very much in love with her
my dear heather
she was the only thing on my mind
not danger
so holding the rose in my teeth
i climbed up on the rooftop
lowered a rope and swung in
through the open window
unfortunately the lady was no longer there
what did you do
i introduced myself to
the lady thatwas there
she was most helpful
would you like some more wine
yes please
heather get out
whats wrong
get out
kurgan
ramírez
the highlander where is he
youre too late ive prepared him for you
you waste your time
it hurts
now you die
you cannot win ramírez im the strongest
my cut has improved your voice
yes
hurts
who is the woman
shes mine
not for much longer
tonight you sleep in hell
there can be only one
hello pretty
id like to speak to russell nash
oh im sorry mr nash isnt here
at the moment
may i call him at home
i have to talk to him today
im afraid that wont be possible
good morning
this is brenda wyatt mr nash
weve already met rachel
what can i do for you
id like some advice
are you the kind of woman
who takes advice
that depends
advice about what
what can you tell me about a 7 lunatic
hacking away with a broadsword
at 1 oclock in the morning
in ney york city 1985
not much
what about a japanese sword
dated 600 bc
the metal in the blade folded 200 times
i dont deal in exotic weapons
can i show you something
in 18th century silver
thats not why i came
here and you know it
do you cook
why
i thought we might have dinner
did you
yes
so im standing there and theres brenda
our little brenda
youre sure it was brenda
she was in nashs shop
she was talking to him
what are you looking at rachel
the eyes in the back of your head
people are asking about you
what am i supposed to say
tell them im immortal
attention four men over here
quiet
dont be afraid
whats your name
rachel
what happened
everybody is dead
im like you im alone
come with me rachel
youre alive why didnt you die
hey its a kind of magic
you should be dead
move
no youll have to shoot me first
whatever you say jack
youre the master race
lets go
that was a long time ago
would you listen to me
for one moment please
you cant hide your feelings from me
ive known you too long
what feelings
how about loneliness
im not lonely
ive got everything i need right here
oh no you dont
you refuse to let anyone love you
love is for poets
youre such a romantic rachel
you always were
just a minute
good evening
do you want to dine in the hall
or shall we step inside
come in
may i take your coat
no thanks
what
ill hold on to it
oh fine
where are you going
i forgot my earrings
make yourself a drink
there are glasses in the bar
do you know what youre doing
i like your place brenda
ive only been here 3 months
im still cleaning it up
interesting view
what did you say
i said interesting view
isnt it great
you never told me what you do for a living
i work for the metropolitan museum
in aquisitions
that explains your interest
in ancient weapons
right
especially the samurai
very nice
shall we have a toast
yes
brandy
bottled in 1783
wow thats old
1783 was a very good year
mozart wrote his great mass
the montgolfier brothers went up
in their first balloon
and england recognized
the independence of the united states
is that right
yes
whats that
its for you
can i open it
if you like
you bastard where did you find this
i have an extensive library
odd thing your bio
doesnt mention the met
it says you work for
the police in forensics
are you and moran trying to set me up
i dont work for moran
then why is that bald policeman sitting
outside watching your apartment
you remember him
morans had him tailing me
whatre you gonna do
the question is what are you gonna do
youre going to turn off the tape
or youre going to shoot me with the 45
i am not looking for a killer i am looking
for a sword the one used on fasil
i found pieces of it under the garden
i only want to see the samurai
why
i told you because its
not supposed to exist
i dated pieces of the blade at 600 bc
the metal had been folded 200 times
the japanese didnt start making
swords like that till the middle ages
so where the hell did it come from
if i could verify the existence
of such a weapon it would be like
discovering 747 a thousand years
before the wright brothers ever flew
this is crazy
wait a minute nash i want some answers
you want
dont you ever think about anything
except what you want
you must leave her brother
heather
heather
connor im here

candle and remember me on my birthday

karen joan nash

what
unwed mothers
nowadays thats no big deal
back then in syracuse

she had the baby and she died
so nash was illegitimate
oh yeah yeah he was illegitimate
for about a minute and a half
he died right after she did
he died
hello brenda
i did what you asked
i spent all night going through the old
deeds to nashs house in hudson street
all the way back back through the five previous
owners to the original guy montague in 1796
in all five instances
montague through nash
i found a death certificate for a kid
with the same name who died at birth
years before he pretended
to sign for his inheritance
jesus rick isnt there any heat in here
no heat is bad for the circuits
now just in case theres any doubt
so what youve got here brenda
is a guy whos been creeping around
since at least 1700
pretending to croak every once in a while
leaving all these goods to kids
whove been corpses for years
and assuming their identities
its not possible
post final
cops release headhunter picture

ramírezs blade did not cut deeply enough
he was right about you youre slime
ramírez was an effete snob
he died on his knees
i took his head and raped his woman
before his blood was even cold
i see
ramírez lied
she was not his woman
she was your woman
and she never told you
i wonder why
perhaps i gave her something
you never could
and secretly she yearned for my return
holy ground highlander
remember what ramírez taught you
you cant stay in here forever
you are weak highlander
you will always be weaker than i
ill be out front
