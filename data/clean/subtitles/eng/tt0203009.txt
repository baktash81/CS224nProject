 the sound of music   
  orchestra continues  
   cancan   
  ends  
  ends  
  resumes  softly  
there was a boy
a very strange
enchanted boy
they say he wandered
very far
very far
over land and sea
  man shouting  
a little shy
  turn away from this village of sin 
  and sad of eye
for it is a veritable
sodom and gomorrah 
but very wise
was he
and then one day
a magic day
he passed my way
and while we spoke
of many things
fools and kings
this he said to me
  man  
the greatest thing
  quiet sobbing  
you ll ever learn
is just to love
  man narrating  
the moulin rouge 
a nightclub 
a dance hall and a bordello   
  the moulin rouge 
  ruled over by harold zidler 
a kingdom
of nighttime pleasures 
where the rich and powerful
came to play with the young
and beautiful creatures   
of the underworld 
the most beautiful
of all these   
was the woman i loved 
satine 
a courtesan 
she sold her love to men 
they called her
 the sparkling diamond  
and she was the star   
of the moulin rouge 
  crowd cheering  
  quiet sobbing  
the woman i loved   
is   
dead 
    typing resumes  
  i first came to paris   
one year ago 
it was 1 899 
the summer of love 
i knew nothing of the moulin rouge 
harold zidler   
or satine 
the world had been swept up
in bohemian revolution 
and i had traveled from london
to be a part of it 
on the hill near paris
was the village of montmartre 
  it was not  as my father had said  
  a village of sin 
but the center
of the bohemian world 
  of the revolution
  musicians  painters  writers 
they were known as
 the children of the revolution  
and that which i believed in
above all things    love 
always this ridiculous
obsession with love 
there was only one problem  
i d never been in love 
    typewriter bell dings  
  luckily  right at that moment 
an unconscious argentinean
fell through my roof 
  man shouts  
he was quickly joined
by a dwarf dressed as a nun 
how do you do 
my name is henri marie raymond
toulouse lautrec monfa 
  what 
  i m terribly sorry about all this 
  we were just upstairs
rehearsing a play 
  what 
a play  something very modern
called spectacular spectacular 
  and it s set in switzerland 
  unfortunately 
the unconscious argentinean   
suffered from a sickness
called narcolepsy 
perfectly fine one moment 
then suddenly      snores  
unconscious the next 
    glass breaking  
    man  high voice   how is he 
wonderful  now the narcoleptic
argentinean is now unconscious 
therefore  the scenario will not
be finished in time to present
to the financier tomorrow 
he s right  toulouse 
i still have to finish the music 
  find someone to read the part 
  where in heaven s name are we
going to find someone   
to read the role of a young 
sensitive swiss poet   goat herder 
  narrator continues  
before i knew it  i was upstairs 
standing in for
the unconscious argentinean 
the hills animate
with the euphonious symphonies
of descant
ha  ha  ha ha ha
oh  stop  stop 
stop  stop  stop  stop 
stop that insufferable droning 
it s drowning out my words 
can we please just stick
to a little decorative piano 
there seemed to be artistic differences
over audrey s lyrics to satie s songs 
i don t think a nun
would say that about a hill 
what if he sings   the hills are vital 
intoning the descant  
  no  no  the hills quake and shake 
  no  no  no  no  the hills  
the hills are incarnate
with symphonic melodies 
  crashing sound  
  no 
  no  the hills  
  the hills  
  the hills  
are chanting
the eternal mantra 
frank is living in my foot 
  all arguing  
the hills are alive
with the sound
of music
whoa 
the hills are alive with
the sound of music  i love it 
  the hills are alive  
  with the sound  
of music
it fits perfectly 
with songs
they have sung
for a thousand years
    all gasping  
  incandiferous 
  audrey  you two should
write the show together 
  i beg your pardon 
but toulouse s suggestion that audrey
and i write the show together   
  was not what audrey wanted to hear 
  good bye 
here s to your first job
in paris 
toulouse  zidler
will never agree 
no offense  but have you ever
written anything like this before 
  no 
  ahh 
  the boy has talent 
    gasps  
i like him  nothing funny 
i just like talent 
the hills are alive
with the sound of music 
see  satie  with christian
we can write   
the truly bohemian revolutionary show
that we ve always dreamt of 
  but how will we convince zidler 
  but toulouse had a plan 
  satine 
  they would dress me in
the argentinean s best suit   
and pass me off
as a famous english writer 
once satine heard my modern poetry 
she would be astounded   
and insist to zidler that i
write spectacular spectacular 
the only problem was  i kept hearing
my father s voice in my head 
you ll end up wasting your life
at the moulin rouge   
with a cancan dancer 
  no  i can t write the show
for the moulin rouge 
  why not 
  i don t even know if i am
a true bohemian revolutionary 
  what 
  do you believe in beauty 
  yes 
  freedom 
  yes  of course 
  truth 
  yes 
  love 
love  love 
above all things 
i believe in love 
love is like oxygen 
love is a many splendored thing 
love lifts us up where we belong 
all you need is love 
  laughing  
see  you can t fool us 
you re the voice of the children
of the revolution 
we can t be fooled 
let s drink to the new writer
of the world s first bohemian
revolutionary show 
it was the perfect plan 
i was to audition for satine 
and i would taste my first
glass of    absinthe 
there was a boy
i m the green fairy 
  all  
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
  hysterical laughing  
a very strange
enchanted boy
yeah  freedom  beauty
truth and love
  the hills are alive
  no  you won t fool the
children of the revolution
  no  you won t fool the children
  with the sound of music
  of the revolution
  we were off to the moulin rouge 
and i was to perform
my poetry for satine 
yaaah 
harold zidler
and his infamous girls 
  they called them his  diamond dogs  
  the diamond dogs

christian 
i m a courtesan 
i m paid to make men believe
what they want to believe 
yes 
silly of me  to think y you could
fall in love with someone like me 
  i can t fall in love with anyone

but a life without love 
that s terrible 
no  being on the street 
that s terrible 
  no  love is like oxygen

  a girl has got to eat 
  all you need is love
  she ll end up on the street 
  all you need is love
love is just a game
i was made for loving you  baby
you were made for loving me
the only way
of loving me  baby
is to pay a lovely fee
just one night
give me just one night
there s no way
 cause you can t pay
  in the name of love
    chuckles  
one night
in the name of love
you crazy fool
i won t give in to you
don t  
leave me this way
i can t survive
without your sweet love
oh  baby

would have had enough
of silly love songs

it isn t so
  chuckling   oh  no 
some people want to
fill the world
with silly love songs
well  what s wrong
with that
i d like to know
 cause here i go again
oh  no 
love lifts us up
where we belong
  get down  get down 
  where eagles fly
on a mountain high
love makes us act
like we are fools
throw our lives away
for one happy day
we could be heroes
just for one day
you
you will be mean
no  i won t 
and i
i ll drink all the time 
we should be lovers
we can t do that
we should be lovers
and that s a fact
though nothing
will keep us together
we could steal time
just for one day
we could be heroes
forever and ever
we could be heroes
forever and ever
we could be heroes
just because
i
will always love you
i
can t help loving
you
how wonderful
life is
now you re in

  christian narrating   how wonderful
life was  now satine was in the world 
  faint ghostly singing  
but in the duke 
zidler had gotten much more
than he had bargained for 
the conversion of the
moulin rouge into a theater will
cost a fantastic sum of money 
so in return 
i would require a contract   
that  um  uh 
binds satine to me   
exclusively 
naturally  i shall require
some security 
i shall require the deeds
to the moulin rouge 
my dear duke  i  
please  don t think
that i m naive  zidler 
i shall hold the deeds
to the moulin rouge 
  and if there are any shenanigans 
  i  
my manservant warner   
will deal with it
in the only language   
that you underworld
show folk understand 
satine will be mine 
it s not that i m
a jealous man 
i just don t like   
other people
touching my things 
  exhales  
i    understand   
completely  duke 
good  now that we have
an understanding 
it would appear that  uh 
you have the means   
to transform
your beloved moulin rouge  
into a theater 
i shall woo satine
over supper tonight 
we will have created   
the world s first
completely modern 
entirely electric 
totally bohemian 
all singing  all dancing   
stage spectacular 
  screaming  murmuring  
the show must go on 
  christian  
yes  the show would go on 
but satine would not attend the supper
that night or the following night 
you have betrayed me 
mad with jealousy  the evil maharajah
forces the courtesan   
to make the penniless sitar player
believe she doesn t love him 
oh  yes  of course 
 thank you for curing me of
my ridiculous obsession with love  
says the penniless sitar player 
throwing money at her feet
and leaving the kingdom forever 
  no  no 
  no 
    laughing  
    toulouse   brilliant  brilliant 
oh  but a life without love 
that s terrible 
  yes  but the sitar player   
  wait  wait  wait 
with the magical sitar  
that s my part  christian 
th that s my part 
  don t you dare  no

to invent perfectly legitimate reasons
to avoid him 
mademoiselle satine  i haven t quite

    continues wheezing  
  coughs  
  continues panting  
that a force
darker than jealousy   
  gasps  coughs  
and stronger than love   
had begun to take hold
of satine 
  coughing intensifies  
  gasps  
where is she

  christian   harold zidler s brilliant
lies had once again averted disaster 
but no lie 
however brilliant 
could save satine 
monsieur zidler 
mademoiselle satine is dying 
she has consumption 
my little sparrow is dying 
  zidler  
she mustn t know  marie 
the show must go on 
  christian   all night
the penniless sitar player had waited 
and now 
for the first time 
he felt the cold stab
of jealousy 
  coughs  
where were you last night 
i told you 
i was sick 
you don t have to
lie to me 
  sighs  
we have to end it 
everyone knows 
harold knows 
sooner or later
the duke will find out too 
on opening night 
i have to sleep with the duke 
and the jealousy
will drive you mad 
    whispers   christian 
  then i ll write a song 
we ll put it in the show  and no matter
how bad things get or whatever happens 
whenever you hear it or when you sing it
or whistle it or hum it 
then you ll know it ll mean
that we love one another 
  i won t get jealous 
  things don t work that way  christian 
we have to end it 
we have to end it 
  sighs  
never knew
i could feel like this
like i ve never
seen the sky
before
want to vanish
inside your kiss
now  uh  this new scene
is the scene where the sitar player   
writes a secret song
for the courtesan   
so that whatever is happening 
however bad things are 
th they remember their love 
and  um  
we could take it
from your line  satine 
so let s take it  
    whispering   we must be careful 
  fear not 
we will conduct our love affair
right under the maharajah 
seasons may change
winter to spring
honestly  amigo 
this is impossible 
but i love you
until the end
of time
come what may
come what may
i will love you
until my dying
day
suddenly the world
seems such
a perfect place
  my dear  a little frog 
    croaking  
suddenly it moves
with such a perfect grace
suddenly my life
doesn t seem
such a waste
it all revolves
around you
  christian  satine  
and there s no mountain too high
no river too wide
sing out this song
and i ll be there
by your side
storm clouds may gather
and stars may collide
  but i love you
  i love you
  until the end
  until the end
  together  
of time
come what may
come what may
i will love
you
  typing  
  panting  
the magical sitar player
falls from the roof and says 
 the greatest thing
you ll ever learn   
is just to love
and be loved in return  
this ending s silly 
why would the courtesan
go for the penniless writer 
whoops 
i mean sitar player 
  orchestra  
  chorus  
come what may
come
come what may
  yes  i will love you
    sobbing hysterically  
come what may
for i will love you
until my dying
day
  ends  
  ends  
i don t like this ending 
don t like the ending 
my dear duke 
why would the courtesan choose
a penniless sitar player   
over the maharajah 
who is offering
a lifetime of security 
that s real love 
once the sitar player
has satisfied his lust 
he will leave the courtesan
with nothing 
i suggest that in the end
the courtesan choose the maharajah 
b but  sorry  
sorry  but that ending
does not uphold the bohemian
ideals of truth  beauty  freedom  
i don t care about
your ridiculous dogma 
why shouldn t the courtesan
choose the maharajah 
because she doesn t love you 
h him 
h him  sh she doesn t love h  
she doesn t love him 
  whispers  
oh  i see 
monsieur zidler 
this ending will be rewritten   
with the courtesan
choosing the maharajah   
and without
the lovers  secret song 
it will be rehearsed
in the morning 
ready for the opening
tomorrow night 
m my dear duke 
th that ll be quite impossible 
harold  oh 
the poor duke is
being treated appallingly 
these silly writers let their
imaginations run away with them 
now  why don t you and i   
have a little supper 
and then afterwards   
we can let
monsieur zidler know   
how we would prefer
the story to end 
hmm 
thank you  elizabeth 
i don t want you
to sleep with him 
  sighs  
he could destroy everything 
  laughing  chattering  
it s for us 
you promised 
you promised to me you wouldn t
be jealous    sighs  
it will be all right 
yes  it will 
  he s waiting 
  no  no 
come
what may
come what may 
  christian   she had gone
to the tower to save us all 
and for our part   
we could do nothing
but wait 
my dear duke  i hope
i have not kept you waiting 
    cough  
    yawns  
don t worry  shakespeare 
you ll get your ending
once the duke gets his   
end in 
  hey  hey  nini  no 
  you keep your hands off me 
  nini gasping  panting  
never fall in love with a woman
who sells herself 
it always ends bad 
the boy has a ridiculous
obsession with me 
i mean  i indulge his fantasy
because he s talented 
we need him 
but only until
tomorrow night 
we have a dance   
in the brothels
of buenos aires 
it tells the story   
  of a prostitute   
    players gasping  laughing  
  murmuring  whistling  
  laughs  
and a man   
who falls in love   
with her 
  violin  sustained note  
  full orchestra  tango  
first there is desire 
then passion 
then suspicion 
jealousy  anger 
betrayal 
where love is for the highest bidder 
there can be no trust 
without trust 
there is no love 
jealousy 
yes  jealousy   
will drive you mad

  zidler  satine  chorus

another hero 
another mindless crime   
behind the curtain   
in the pantomime

whatever happened
we leave it all
to chance
another heartache
another failed romance

outside
the dawn is breaking
on the stage
that holds
our final destiny
the show must go on
the show must go on
inside
my heart is breaking
my makeup
may be flaking
but my smile
still stays on
  zidler  chorus  
the show must go on
the show must go on
i ll top the bill
i ll earn the kill
i have to find the will
to carry on

what toulouse had said 
but he had filled me
with doubt 
  door shuts  
and there was only one way
to be sure
