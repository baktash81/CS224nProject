resumes softly
there was a boy
a very strange
enchanted boy
they say he wandered
very far
very far
over land and sea
man shouting
a little shy
turn away from this village of sin
and sad of eye
for it is a veritable
sodom and gomorrah
but very wise
was he
and then one day
a magic day
he passed my way
and while we spoke
of many things
fools and kings
this he said to me
man
the greatest thing
quiet sobbing
youll ever learn
is just to love
man narrating
the moulin rouge
a nightclub
a dance hall and a bordello
the moulin rouge
ruled over by harold zidler
a kingdom
of nighttime pleasures
where the rich and powerful
came to play with the young
and beautiful creatures
of the underworld
the most beautiful
of all these
was the woman i loved
satine
a courtesan
she sold her love to men
they called her
the sparkling diamond
and she was the star
of the moulin rouge
crowd cheering
quiet sobbing
the woman i loved
is
dead
typing resumes
i first came to paris
one year ago
it was 1 899
the summer of love
i knew nothing of the moulin rouge
harold zidler
or satine
the world had been swept up
in bohemian revolution
and i had traveled from london
to be a part of it
on the hill near paris
was the village of montmartre
it was not as my father had said
a village of sin
but the center
of the bohemian world
of the revolution
musicians painters writers
they were known as
the children of the revolution
and that which i believed in
above all things  love
always this ridiculous
obsession with love
there was only one problem
id never been in love
typewriter bell dings
luckily right at that moment
an unconscious argentinean
fell through my roof
man shouts
he was quickly joined
by a dwarf dressed as a nun
how do you do
my name is henri marie raymond
toulouselautrec monfa
what
im terribly sorry about all this
we were just upstairs
rehearsing a play
what
a play something very modern
called spectacular spectacular
and its set in switzerland
unfortunately
the unconscious argentinean
suffered from a sickness
called narcolepsy
perfectly fine one moment
then suddenly   snores
unconscious the next
glass breaking
man high voice  how is he
wonderful now the narcoleptic
argentinean is now unconscious
therefore the scenario will not
be finished in time to present
to the financier tomorrow
hes right toulouse
i still have to finish the music
find someone to read the part
where in heavens name are we
going to find someone
to read the role of a young
sensitive swiss poet  goatherder
narrator continues
before i knew it i was upstairs
standing in for
the unconscious argentinean
the hills animate
with the euphonious symphonies
of descant
ha ha hahaha
oh stop stop
stop stop stop stop
stop that insufferable droning
its drowning out my words
can we please just stick
to a little decorative piano
there seemed to be artistic differences
over audreys lyrics to saties songs
i dont think a nun
would say that about a hill
what if he sings the hills are vital
intoning the descant
no no the hills quake and shake
no no no no the hills
the hills are incarnate
with symphonic melodies
crashing sound
no
no the hills
the hills
the hills
are chanting
the eternal mantra
frank is living in my foot
all arguing
the hills are alive
with the sound
of music
whoa
the hills are alive with
the sound of music i love it
the hills are alive
with the sound
of music
it fits perfectly
with songs
they have sung
for a thousand years
all gasping
incandiferous
audrey you two should
write the show together
i beg your pardon
but toulouses suggestion that audrey
and i write the show together
was not what audrey wanted to hear
goodbye
heres to your first job
in paris
toulouse zidler
will never agree
no offense but have you ever
written anything like this before
no
ahh
the boy has talent
gasps
i like him nothing funny
i just like talent
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
see satie with christian
we can write
the truly bohemian revolutionary show
that weve always dreamt of
but how will we convince zidler
but toulouse had a plan
satine
they would dress me in
the argentineans best suit
and pass me off
as a famous english writer
once satine heard my modern poetry
she would be astounded
and insist to zidler that i
write spectacular spectacular
the only problem was i kept hearing
my fathers voice in my head
youll end up wasting your life
at the moulin rouge
with a cancan dancer
no i cant write the show
for the moulin rouge
why not
i dont even know if i am
a true bohemian revolutionary
what
do you believe in beauty
yes
freedom
yes of course
truth
yes
love
love love
above all things
i believe in love
love is like oxygen
love is a manysplendored thing
love lifts us up where we belong
all you need is love
laughing
see you cant fool us
youre the voice of the children
of the revolution
we cant be fooled
lets drink to the new writer
of the worlds first bohemian
revolutionary show
it was the perfect plan
i was to audition for satine
and i would taste my first
glass of absinthe
there was a boy
im the green fairy
all
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
hysterical laughing
a very strange
enchanted boy
yeah freedom beauty
truth and love
the hills are alive
no you wont fool the
children of the revolution
no you wont fool the children
with the sound of music
of the revolution
we were off to the moulin rouge
and i was to perform
my poetry for satine
yaaah
harold zidler
and his infamous girls
they called them his diamond dogs

my little sparrow is dying
zidler
she mustnt know marie
the show must go on
christian  all night
the penniless sitar player had waited
and now
for the first time
he felt the cold stab
of jealousy
coughs
where were you last night
i told you
i was sick
you dont have to
lie to me
sighs
we have to end it
everyone knows
harold knows
sooner or later
the duke will find out too
on opening night
i have to sleep with the duke
and the jealousy
will drive you mad
whispers  christian
then ill write a song
well put it in the show and no matter
how bad things get or whatever happens
whenever you hear it or when you sing it
or whistle it or hum it
then youll know itll mean
that we love one another
i wont get jealous
things dont work that way christian
we have to end it
we have to end it
sighs
never knew
i could feel like this
like ive never
seen the sky
before
want to vanish
inside your kiss
now uh this new scene
is the scene where the sitar player
writes a secret song
for the courtesan
so that whatever is happening
however bad things are
ththey remember their love
and um
we could take it
from your line satine
so lets take it
whispering  we must be careful
fear not
we will conduct our love affair
right under the maharajah
seasons may change
winter to spring
honestly amigo
this is impossible
but i love you
until the end
of time
come what may
come what may
i will love you
until my dying
day
suddenly the world
seems such
a perfect place
my dear a little frog
croaking
suddenly it moves
with such a perfect grace
suddenly my life
doesnt seem
such a waste
it all revolves
around you
christian satine
and theres no mountain too high
no river too wide
sing out this song
and ill be there
by your side
storm clouds may gather
and stars may collide
but i love you
i love you
until the end
until the end
together
of time
come what may
come what may
i will love
you
typing
panting
the magical sitar player
falls from the roof and says
the greatest thing
youll ever learn
is just to love
and be loved in return
this endings silly
why would the courtesan
go for the penniless writer
whoops
i mean sitar player
orchestra
chorus
come what may
come
come what may
yes i will love you
sobbing hysterically
come what may
for i will love you
until my dying
day
ends
ends
i dont like this ending
dont like the ending
my dear duke
why would the courtesan choose
a penniless sitar player
over the maharajah
who is offering
a lifetime of security
thats real love
once the sitar player
has satisfied his lust
he will leave the courtesan
with nothing
i suggest that in the end
the courtesan choose the maharajah
bbut sorry
sorry but that ending
does not uphold the bohemian
ideals of truth beauty freedom
i dont care about
your ridiculous dogma
why shouldnt the courtesan
choose the maharajah
because she doesnt love you
hhim
hhim shshe doesnt love h
she doesnt love him
whispers
oh i see
monsieur zidler
this ending will be rewritten
with the courtesan
choosing the maharajah
and without
the lovers secret song
it will be rehearsed
in the morning
ready for the opening
tomorrow night
mmy dear duke
ththatll be quite impossible
harold oh
the poor duke is
being treated appallingly
these silly writers let their
imaginations run away with them
now why dont you and i
have a little supper
and then afterwards
we can let
monsieur zidler know
how we would prefer
the story to end
hmm
thank you elizabeth
i dont want you
to sleep with him
sighs
he could destroy everything
laughing chattering
its for us
you promised
you promised to me you wouldnt
be jealous  sighs
it will be all right
yes it will
hes waiting
no no
come
what may
come what may
christian  she had gone
to the tower to save us all
and for our part
we could do nothing
but wait
my dear duke i hope
i have not kept you waiting
cough
yawns
dont worry shakespeare
youll get your ending
once the duke gets his
end in
hey hey nini no
you keep your hands off me
nini gasping panting
never fall in love with a woman
who sells herself
it always ends bad
the boy has a ridiculous
obsession with me

of a prostitute
players gasping laughing
murmuring whistling

with her
violin sustained note

there is no love
jealousy
