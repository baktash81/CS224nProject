soft and polite
and expect things

  gunshot  
hey  hand me that string

for this
construction biz 
  knife clinking  
  birds chirping  
somebody
give me a hand 
hey 
l ll help you out 
and then he thought
he heard it 
and that s when vernon
turned around
and looked in his rear window 
and there 
staring back at him  
was the hook man  
ah ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha 
so  he stomped on the gas 
and he tore outta there 
and the next day  vernon
went out to get in his car 
and there  hanging
on the rearview mirror 
was the hook 
l thought
it was supposed to be
on the door handle 
   ha ha 
   yeah 
yeah   it was originally 
but  uh   but then vernon hung it
on the rearview mirror 
you know  like a souvenir 
like dice and baby shoes 
uh huh  
ah heh  
well   does anybody else  uh  
have an interesting story 
uh   chief  uh   can you
tell us a big story 
heh heh heh  
  speaking native language  
l speak
to the young braves
so that they may know
of the old ways 
  speaking native language  
l speak to them
so that they may know
what this ground holds
of the spirits of the past 
  speaking native language  
when a young brave was ready
to become a warrior 
it was here
that he was called
by the wise men
and the elders 
  speaking native language  
lf he had faith
in the great one 
the knife
would not cut him 
  speaking native language  
lf he had courage 
true courage 
the rock
would not break him 
  speaking native language  
lf the brave
was pure of heart 
the arrow
could not catch him 
  speaking native language  
and then he would become
a warrior 
as someday you will 
  speaking native language  
and that was called
the ceremony of the blade 
the stone  and the arrow 
like in our culture   
paper  rock  scissors 
  all groan  
  bird calling in distance  
  laughter  
man   that sure was
some rap the old chief
was putting on us 
yeah   l wonder
if that stuff is true 
well   you wouldn t catch me
standing around
letting some lunatic
throw knives at me 
whap 
  fire igniting  
oh   no 
that s our tepee 
who did this 
who do you think 
man   let s get  em  
yeah   come on  
looks like you fellas
forgot something here 
  sniffs   we wouldn t
want you to get thirsty 
now  would we  fellas 
so we come to repay
the favor 
  lndistinct shouting  
fighting  
mr  tipton  your boys
are out of control 
l mean  this last fight 
it was the last straw 
l ve got other campers
l ve got to think about here 
l think it s best
for all concerned
if we just send them all
back to the institution  
where they can get
the supervision they need  
don t do it  sir 
ernest  it s not really
your fault  lt s my fault 
l thought you could do it 
l was wrong  
but it s not fair
to send them back 
lt s not their fault 
maybe l was a bad counselor 
they shouldn t have to
suffer for that 
look  if you give
the second chance boys
another chance
and me another chance 
that ll be three chances 
and added to the two chances
we had before  that makes     
five or six chances   
carry the one   
okay  ernest 
one more chance 
l ll let the boys stay 
but they better
get with the program      
you know what l mean 
oh   l know what you mean  
yes  sir  thank you  
  speaking japanese  
thank you  
they were all set
to send you boys
back to the institute 
when you know who stepped in
