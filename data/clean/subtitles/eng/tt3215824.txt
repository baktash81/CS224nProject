whats with the limp
its nothing
you missed the boy
that seems unlikely
hmm
we promise absolutes
and unlikely is not an absolute
the man was resourceful enough
to make it all the way here
so assume he was resourceful
enough to have duplicates
of everything we retrieved
from the das office
and assume that those duplicates
are in the possession of that boy
assume the worst
case scenario
assume catastrophe and
act accordingly
its a lot of risk
that i am aware of
you have what maybe six hours
before this things untenable
i can buy us more time
but they have to
have the stomach for it
i will make them
have the stomach for it
should have been
two teams
hit em

what got us here doesnt really
matter now does it jack
no it doesnt
no it doesnt
its a zerosum game
treat it that way
are we going to the station
brotherinlaw

maybe we get lucky
this is a lot of risk
for a boy
well theyre worried
about what he might know
and what he saw us do
from this point forward
we put down anyone who sees our faces
thats gonna bring a lot of attention to
this town theres enough of that already
give em something else

thing and it was doing another
so instead of fighting it
we found ourselves running from it

and all i could do was watch
i watched my mother
die of cancer
