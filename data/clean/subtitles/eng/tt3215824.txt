i ll meet you there when we re done 
  what s with the limp 
  it s nothing 
you missed the boy 
that seems unlikely 
hmm 
we promise absolutes 
and  unlikely  is not an absolute 
the man was resourceful enough
to make it all the way here 
so assume he was resourceful
enough to have duplicates
of everything we retrieved
from the da s office 
and assume that those duplicates
are in the possession of that boy 
assume the worst
case scenario 
assume catastrophe and   
act accordingly 
it s a lot of risk 
that  i am aware of 
you have  what  maybe six hours
before this thing s untenable 
i can buy us more time 
but they have to
have the stomach for it 
i will make them
have the stomach for it 
should have been
two teams 
hit  em
at the same time 
what got us here doesn t really
matter  now  does it  jack 
  no  it doesn t 
  no  it doesn t 
it s a zero sum game 
treat it that way 
  are we going to the station 
  brother in law   
i think 
maybe we get lucky 
this is a lot of risk
for a boy 
well  they re worried
about what he might know 
and what he saw us do 
from this point forward 
we put down anyone who sees our faces 
that s gonna bring a lot of attention to
this town  there s enough of that already 
give  em something else
to worry about 
let  em focus on this
for a while 
yep 
allie  there s
no sign of connor 
well  are they looking

full advantage of that situation 
campfires are like catnip
for teenage girls 
and all you need is some
fuel  some heat   
and voila 
you re swapping spit
with a cheerleader 
  getting struck by lightning made you weird

you just look sad to me 
i look sad 
there was a fire last year that
i was in charge of fighting 
and   
i thought the wind was doing one
thing  and it was doing another 
so instead of fighting it 
we found ourselves running from it 
which is not where
you want to be 
and there were three boys   
around your age   
they got caught in the fire 
and all i could do was watch 
i watched my mother
die of cancer 
it is impossible to feel sorry
for myself around you 
i m sorry 
me  too
