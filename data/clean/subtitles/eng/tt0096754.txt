this is flatbed preparing to surface 
roger  flatbed  come on up 
all rig personnel assemble at the moon pool 
everybody get to sub bay  asap 
come on  let s get his hat off 
  take it off 
  what the hell s goin  on 
  how come we got recalled 
  the hell if i know 
i got it 
  what s the drift  pardner  why are we up 
  just follow standard procedure 
flog your dog till somebody

  what s the story  boss 
  folks  listen up 
we just been told to shut down the hole
and prepare to move the rig 
  oh  shit 
  what 
we ve received an invitation to  um 
cooperate in a matter of national security 
now you know as much as i do 
get your gear off and get to control 
we ve got a briefing in ten minutes 
come on  let s move it 
at 0922 local time today
an american nuclear submarine 
the uss montana 
with 156 men aboard  went down
  about 22 miles from here 
  damn 
there s been no contact with the sub since
then  the cause of the incident is not known 
your company has authorised
the navy s use of this facility
for a rescue operation
code named operation salvor 
  you want us to search for the sub 
  no  we know where it is 
but she s in 2 000 feet of water
and we can t reach her 
we need divers to enter the sub
and search for survivors    if any 
don t you have your own stuff for this 
by the time we get our submersibles here 
the storm ll be on us 
you can get your rig in and be on site
in 15 hours  that makes you our best option 
why should we risk our butts
for something like this 
i have been authorised
to offer you all special bonuses
equivalent to three times normal dive pay 
yes  sir  buddy 
for triple time  i d eat beany 
set me on fire
and put me out with horse piss 
i don t know what kind of deal
you made with the company 
but my people are not qualified for this 
we re oil workers 
shut up  hold it down 
this is lieutenant coffey 
he will transfer down to you with
a seal team and supervise the operation 
send down whoever you like 
but i m the tool pusher on this rig 
when it comes to the safety of these people 
there s me and then god 
understand  if things get dicey 
i m pulling the plug 
i think we re all
on the same wavelength  brigman 
now  let s get the wellhead uncoupled 
shall we 
let s take it about five degrees left  all right 
roger  five degrees left  bud 
plot these numbers to our position 
i need to know when the leading edge will hit 
well  it s official 
they re calling it hurricane frederick 
and it s gonna be making our lives
  real interesting in a few hours 
  fred 
i don t know  man  i think hurricanes
should be named after women  don t you 
  i can t believe you re letting them do this 
  hi  lins 
i thought you were in houston 
i was  now i m here 
  only here isn t where i left it  is it  bud 
  wasn t up to me 
we were that close to proving
a submersible drilling platform could work 
  i can t believe you let them grab my rig 
  your rig 
  i designed the damn thing 
  benthic petroleum paid for it 
so as long as they re holding the pink slip 
i go where they tell me 
i had a lot riding on this  they bought you 
didn t they  more like rented you cheap 
i m switchin  off now 
bye bye

wow  you re right  us poor dumb old boys
might ve had to think for ourselves 
it could ve been a disaster 
  you wanna know what i think 
  jesus  look where this thing is set

but what did he see that made him panic 
well  what do you think he saw 
i don t know 
  did any of you see it 
  no  sir  the brigman woman saw it 
could have been a russian bogey 
cinclantflt s gonna go apeshit 
two russian attack subs  a tango and a
victor  were tracked to within 50 miles of here 
and now they don t know
where the hell they are  ok 
i don t have any choice 
i m confirming you to go to phase two 
you ll recover one warhead  arm it 
and wait for further instructions 
  have we got a problem with that 
  negative  sir 
come on 
  what d he say 
  turn it up  bozo 
   early reports that the montana encountered
a soviet fast attack sub prior to its sinking
and the kremlin
continues to deny any involvement 
that s us  that s us  man 
benthic petroleum are participating
in the recovery operation 
but we have little information 
we want names 
hey  that s the explorer  we re famous 
there is a tremendous amount of activity 
with cuba only 80 miles away 
the massive build up of american forces
has drawn official protest
from havana and moscow 
russian and cuban trawlers 
undoubtedly surveillance vessels 
have been circling the area
  and soviet aircraft have been warned away 
  this sucks 
  hippy  what s the matter with you 
  what s the matter with me  nothing 
we re in the middle
of some international incident
  like the cuban missile crisis 
  figured that out for yourself  hip 
we got russian subs creeping around 
anything goes wrong 
they could say whatever they want happened 
relax  will you 
you re making the women nervous 
  cute  virgil 
  you know 
those seals ain t tellin  us diddly 
something is goin  on 
  come on  come on 
  hippy  you think everything s a conspiracy 
everything is 
coffey s splitting with flatbed 
i showed him how to work the controls
and they re outta here 
  didn t you tell him we need it 
  yeah 
  where the hell is he takin  it 
  i have no idea 
shit 
coffey  come back  we need
the big arm to unhook the umbilical 
there s a goddamn hurricane coming 
  he switched off 
  it s unbelievable 
go back down and tell those men
to get below and stay there 
we need to get unhooked
and get out of here now 
  all right  do it  then 
  no problem  except your boys
went sightseeing with flatbed  my people
need flatbed to get unhooked at their end 
  back in two hours 
  two hours  
we re gonna get the shit kicked out of us
by our pal fred in two hours 
ok  set cold tab fitting to 200psi 
  set 
  there she goes 
  she s breakin  loose 
  bringin  her up 
ok 
all right 
clear the hatch 
go on with it 
go on  that s it  up 
sir  the missile looks intact 
little is known about the events
leading up to the collision 
the us navy guided missile cruiser appleton
apparently struck the soviet udaloy class
destroyer in low visibility conditions 
in violent seas  little hope remains
for over 100 russian crewmen 
still missing after the sinking an hour ago 
soviet military spokesmen
have claimed that the collision
constituted an unprovoked attack 
  this was denied by   
  bud  this is big time 
   who said that captain michael sweeney   
  ok  it s clear 
  it s all yours  sir 
i m gonna swing it away and drop it 
check  ok 
bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer 
  got it 
  separation sequencer disconnected 
remove explosive bolts one through six
  in counterclockwise sequence 
  check  removing bolt one 
negotiators have walked out
of the strategic arms limitation talks
in protest over the incident this morning 
the deterioration of relations
with the united states   
soviet build up of tanks
and aircraft has continued 
   this morning  all us and nato military
forces have been put on full alert

all i want is 24 hour surveillance
on exterior cameras 
  you ve got six people  i ve got   
  comin  through

of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras 
that russian bogey comes back

  give me a break  coffey 
those things live three and a half miles down
in an abyssal trench

hey  cat 
yeah 
why don t you take
the first watch on sonar  ok

sonny  you get a couple of hours  sleep

hippy  you handle exterior surveillance 
one night    will you do me a favour
and see if you can get that transmitter fixed 
  all right

all right 
come on  aj squared away 
a little to the left 
what is    
oh  this is not happening 
i m shaking  man  all right  wait  and now   
here s mirv 
  oh  come on  man  what else could it be 
  why bring it here 
it s gotta be some kind of emergency plan
to keep it away from the russians  right 
look  they hot wire one of the nukes 
they use some kind of detonator
that they brought 
then they stick it back in the sub 
fry the whole thing up  bam 
slicker than snot 
i m tellin  you  and i m not being paranoi   
hi  lins 
  lins  will you just wait a second 
  if you don t do something about it  i will 
  lindsey  we ll do something about it 
  fellas   hello 
  lins  stop and think about this for a second 
  what 
you know  you ve got some huevos
bringing that thing into my rig 
with all that s goin  on up in the world 
you bring a nuclear weapon
  in here 
  mrs brigman   
does this strike anyone
as particularly psychotic  or is it just me 
mrs brigman  you don t need to know
the details of our operation 
  it s better if you don t 
  you re right  i don t need to know 
what i need to know is that thing is
off this rig  do you hear me  roger ramjet  
you re becoming
a serious impediment to our mission 
now  you either do an about face and walk
out of here  or i ll have you escorted out 
i will not do an about face and get outta here 
  who the hell do you think you re talking to 
  emergency  maintenance room b  move it 
on the double 
now 
  in here  come on  we got trouble  come on 
  what s goin  on 
all right 
  what s up  what s happening 
  you let her go  man  do it 
do it now 
let her go 
the smartest thing you ever did 
  coffey  you son of a bitch 
  lindsey  cool it 
  what s the problem 
  nothing  we were just leaving  weren t we 
we don t need them 
we can t trust them 
we may have to take steps 
we re gonna have to take steps 
lins  i want you
to stay away from that guy  i mean it 
the guy is gone  did you see his hands 
what  he s got the shakes 
look  he s operating on his own 
he s cut off from his chain of command 
he s showing signs
of pressure induced psychosis 
and he s got a nuclear weapon 
so  as a personal favour to me  will you try
to put your tongue in neutral for a while 
i gotta tell you  i give this whole thing
a sphincter factor of about 9 5 
you can just punch into his primary
guidance chip where you want him to go
  and he ll go there  right 
  no  bad idea  lindsey 
why  hip  come on 
because even if it could take the pressure
at that depth  which i don t think it can 
without the tether  you know what would
happen  it would just sit like a dumb shit 
something would have to pass
in front of the camera for you to see anything 
but we could get lucky 
so we should go for it 
i really ought to talk to bud about this 
no  this is between you and me  we get
proof and then we tell the others  hippy  look 
if we can prove to coffey
that there aren t russians down there 
maybe he ll ease off the button a little bit 
i gotta tell you  that guy scares me more
than anything we re gonna find down there 
he s a goddamn
aj squared away jarhead robot 
give me a couple of hours 
i ll see what i can do 
great  thanks

so  raise your hand if you think
it was a russian water tentacle 
lieutenant 
no  well   
a breakthrough 
hey  ace 
  you done impressing yourself 
  no way that thing could just be seawater 
they must have learned to control water 
i mean  at a molecular level 
they can plasticise it  pulverise it 
do whatever they wanna do with it 
  they can put it under intelligent control 
  maybe    their whole technology
is based on that controlling water 
was it the same thing
that you saw the last time 
no 
you know  i don t think that
that thing you saw was one of them 
  what are you talkin  about 
  i mean  i don t think it was an nti 
i think it was like their version of an rov 
like big geek 
hippy  you mean
they was just checkin  us out

curious  i suppose 
we re probably the first people
they ve ever seen 
it went straight for the warhead 
and they think it s cute 
you need to get some sleep 
we have no   
   way of warning the surface 
and you know what that means 
it means whatever happens   
   is up to us 
us 
so you think they re from down there
originally  or from   
   you know 
i don t know 
i think    i think they re from  you know  
someplace with similar conditions 
  cold  intense pressure 
  oh  man 
happy as hogs in a waller down there 
probably 
sniff something 
did you  rat boy 
hey
