at 0922 local time today
an american nuclear submarine
the uss montana
with 156 men aboard went down
about 22 miles from here
damn
theres been no contact with the sub since
then the cause of the incident is not known
your company has authorised
the navys use of this facility
for a rescue operation
codenamed operation salvor
you want us to search for the sub
no we know where it is
but shes in 2000 feet of water
and we cant reach her
we need divers to enter the sub
and search for survivors if any
dont you have your own stuff for this
by the time we get our submersibles here
the stormll be on us
you can get your rig in and be on site
in 15 hours that makes you our best option
why should we risk our butts
for something like this
i have been authorised
to offer you all special bonuses
equivalent to three times normal dive pay
yes sir buddy
for triple time id eat beany
set me on fire
and put me out with horse piss
i dont know what kind of deal
you made with the company
but my people are not qualified for this
were oil workers
shut up hold it down
this is lieutenant coffey
he will transfer down to you with
a seal team and supervise the operation
send down whoever you like
but im the tool pusher on this rig
when it comes to the safety of these people
theres me and then god
understand if things get dicey
im pulling the plug
i think were all
on the same wavelength brigman
now lets get the wellhead uncoupled
shall we
lets take it about five degrees left all right
roger five degrees left bud
plot these numbers to our position
i need to know when the leading edge will hit
well its official
theyre calling it hurricane frederick
and its gonna be making our lives

early reports that the montana encountered
a soviet fast attack sub prior to its sinking

continues to deny any involvement
thats us thats us man
benthic petroleum are participating
in the recovery operation
but we have little information
we want names
hey thats the explorer were famous
there is a tremendous amount of activity
with cuba only 80 miles away
the massive buildup of american forces
has drawn official protest
from havana and moscow
russian and cuban trawlers
undoubtedly surveillance vessels
have been circling the area
and soviet aircraft have been warned away
this sucks
hippy whats the matter with you
whats the matter with me nothing
were in the middle
of some international incident
like the cuban missile crisis
figured that out for yourself hip
we got russian subs creeping around
anything goes wrong
they could say whatever they want happened
relax will you
youre making the women nervous
cute virgil
you know
those seals aint tellin us diddly
something is goin on
come on come on
hippy you think everythings a conspiracy

little is known about the events
leading up to the collision
the us navy guided missile cruiser appleton
apparently struck the soviet udaloy class
destroyer in low visibility conditions
in violent seas little hope remains
for over 100 russian crewmen
still missing after the sinking an hour ago
soviet military spokesmen
have claimed that the collision
constituted an unprovoked attack
this was denied by
bud this is big time
who said that captain michael sweeney
ok its clear
its all yours sir
im gonna swing it away and drop it
check ok
bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer
got it
separation sequencer disconnected
remove explosive bolts one through six
in counterclockwise sequence
check removing bolt one
negotiators have walked out
of the strategic arms limitation talks
in protest over the incident this morning
the deterioration of relations
with the united states

comin through
everybody just stop
all right i want aroundtheclock manning
of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras
that russian bogey comes back
i dont think we should be taking a nap

those things live three and a half miles down
in an abyssal trench
trust me theyre not speaking russian
have you finished the repairs
on the acoustical transmitter yet

come on aj squared away
a little to the left
what is
oh this is not happening
im shaking man all right wait and now
heres mirv
oh come on man what else could it be
why bring it here
its gotta be some kind of emergency plan
to keep it away from the russians right
look they hotwire one of the nukes
they use some kind of detonator
that they brought
then they stick it back in the sub
fry the whole thing up bam
slicker than snot
im tellin you and im not being paranoi
hi lins
lins will you just wait a second
if you dont do something about it i will
lindsey well do something about it
fellas hello
lins stop and think about this for a second
what
you know youve got some huevos
bringing that thing into my rig
with all thats goin on up in the world
you bring a nuclear weapon
in here
mrs brigman
does this strike anyone
as particularly psychotic or is it just me
mrs brigman you dont need to know
the details of our operation
its better if you dont
youre right i dont need to know
what i need to know is that thing is
off this rig do you hear me roger ramjet
youre becoming
a serious impediment to our mission
now you either do an aboutface and walk
out of here or ill have you escorted out
i will not do an aboutface and get outta here
who the hell do you think youre talking to
emergency maintenance room b move it
on the double
now
in here come on we got trouble come on
whats goin on
all right
whats up whats happening
you let her go man do it
do it now
let her go
the smartest thing you ever did
coffey you son of a bitch
lindsey cool it
whats the problem
nothing we were just leaving werent we
we dont need them
we cant trust them
we may have to take steps
were gonna have to take steps
lins i want you
to stay away from that guy i mean it
the guy is gone did you see his hands
what hes got the shakes
look hes operating on his own
hes cut off from his chain of command
hes showing signs
of pressureinduced psychosis
and hes got a nuclear weapon
so as a personal favour to me will you try
to put your tongue in neutral for a while
i gotta tell you i give this whole thing
a sphincter factor of about 95
you can just punch into his primary
guidance chip where you want him to go
and hell go there right
no bad idea lindsey
why hip come on
because even if it could take the pressure
at that depth which i dont think it can
without the tether you know what would
happen it would just sit like a dumb shit
something would have to pass
in front of the camera for you to see anything
but we could get lucky
so we should go for it
i really ought to talk to bud about this
no this is between you and me we get
proof and then we tell the others hippy look
if we can prove to coffey
that there arent russians down there
maybe hell ease off the button a little bit
i gotta tell you that guy scares me more
than anything were gonna find down there
hes a goddamn
aj squared away jarhead robot
give me a couple of hours
ill see what i can do

no way that thing could just be seawater
they must have learned to control water
i mean at a molecular level
they can plasticise it pulverise it
do whatever they wanna do with it
they can put it under intelligent control
maybe their whole technology
is based on thatcontrolling water
