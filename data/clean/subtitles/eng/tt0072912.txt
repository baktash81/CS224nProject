a day 
and expenses

of the profession 
feel left out

of those two  you hear 
sure 
hi  lew harper 
mrs  james devereaux
is expecting me 
yes  i ll tell
mrs  devereaux you re here 
all i said was that the opening
is a little flowery 
well  damn it  at least
give it a fair reading 
why don t you indulge yourself
in another drink 
it might help create
the atmosphere for your   
your artistry 
the one indulgence
i have never had is privacy 
it just isn t very good 
i m afraid 
mrs  devereaux 
yes 
there s a gentleman here
to see you 
thank you 
i don t know
where to start 
why don t you start where
you stopped yesterday 
i m frightened  lew 
that s a good place 
hey  you re not running off
again  are you 
 mr  james devereaux  
 dear mr  devereaux 
lilies that fester smell
far worse than weeds  
 the deceived husband 
 so love s face may
still seem love to you 
 though altered anew 
 do you enjoy playing
the cuckold 
 or are you unaware
of your wife s
amorous activity  
well  it s
an old portable
with a flaky  e  
interesting style 
if i remember my
high school lit class 
mailed right here
in rivage 
rivage 
does your husband
know about this 
no  he wasn t at home
when the mail arrived 
you usually read
his mail 
we read each other s mail 
what does he do
for a living 
writes unproduced plays 
between drinks 
where does all this
come from 
oh  this all belongs
to his mother 
olivia s family has owned
beau rivage for 175 years 
the abolition of slavery was
a mild agitation for them 
how did you slip in 
oh  born into the lace 
good blood  no money 
one becomes accustomed
to style 
is that the old lady 
olivia 
what s she
doing out there 
changing the guard 
she has an iron clamp
around this house 
do you know
that she keeps us
on allowances
like adolescents 
if she ever got hold
of that letter   
i can manage james 
it s mama that scares me 
she d make my life
a nightmare 
do you 
do i what 
enjoy connubial bliss
outside the bounds of
holy matrimony 
that s an unusual question
for you to ask 
that s my business 
the marriage hasn t worked
for some years now 
why don t you
just break it off 
and do what 
and   
where do you think
this all came from 
it came from pat reavis 
who is he 
he was the family
chauffeur   
until i fired him
a few days ago 
that letter came in the mail
the next morning 
did you have a fling
with him 
no  i did not have a fling
with the family chauffeur 
what do you
want me to do 
i want you
to make him stop 
i do not want
any more letters 
i don t know
what to say 
i ll take a run at it 
iris

thank you 
where do i find
this reavis fellow

representative 
and  uh

my answer is no   
and will remain so
for as long as i live 
well  uh  yes  ma am 
i ll be happy to 
just tell me
where i can find him 
mr  harper  i can do
without the charades 
mr  kilbourne is forever
trying these tiresome tactics 
and he s a rank amateur 
this is going to come
as something
of a surprise  ma am 
but i don t work
for mr  kilbourne 
in fact  i don t even   
i don t even know him 
i detest you big oil

and tell your employer
jay hue kilbourne
to go to hell 
yes  ma am 
i see what you mean 
she s a functioning
ball breaker 
did you find anything 
enough to get started 
is that your friend
from the french quarter 
oh  that s peter 
he s helping james with
his creative endeavors 
o k 
uh   
well  where were we 
i found that old portable

can be pretty easily conned 
this ain t exactly what
i d call heavy ammunition 
well  what else
can you do 
i don t know 
try to find him 
hit him with this 
and hope
it scares him off 
it ain t easy
standing around
talking shop with you 
no  i m finding it
difficult
to adjust
to the sight of you 
were you angry
when i left los angeles
so suddenly 
i d have been angry
if it had never
happened at all 
iris  you are wearing
my gardening hat again 
i would be so grateful 
so everlastingly grateful 
if in future
you would ask my permission 
yes  mother 
i could kill
that bitch 
hey  excuse me 
can i talk to you
a minute 
sure 
i thought you might
be interested
in taking
a little ride   
you know 
around the city 
i don t think
i got the time 
right up front 
i am required by law
to advise you guys
that my hands
are registered
in the state
of california
as lethal weapons 
you understand 
oh  really 
a black belt  huh 
you betcha 
glo  show him yours 
well  that s
a different ball game 
i was just   
i was just kidding 
i m a brown belt 
actually 
where do you
want me to sit 
you want
front or back 
back s fine 
could you    could you
slide over there  tiger 
anything you say 
buddy 
hey  harper  step
lightly on over here 
sure glad you could see
fit to come visit us 
i wouldn t have
missed this for the world 
jay hue kilbourne
here 
always a pleasure
to welcome newcomers
to our domain 
uh 
they re in training 
that one s ready 
i raised that little
fella from a pup 
matter of fact 
he favors
a nephew of mine 
boy s features
aren t regular 
sort of pinched
with strange
little ears 
damn near broke
my sister s heart 
oh  i can imagine 
you know anything
about pit bulls 
mr  harper 
we got regular
straight up
teeth matches
on weekends 
lot of big money
wagered 
and illegal as hell 
how do you
tell the winner 
like anything else 
only one sure way 
one of them s
left alive 
hee  i have fun 
mr  harper 
hell of a good time 
you see  i m not
like most folks
who get their kicks
head on 
i sort of slide in
sideways  like 
as a matter of fact 
in high school 
they used to call me
the crab 
oh 
now you take
the oil business   
my business 
it s never
any fun
to drill
straight down 
i m a slant driller
by instinct 
are you
slant drilling me 
very perceptive 
you see those tidelands 
mr  harper 
yeah 
no  i mean right   
no  i saw them 
well 
they re oil rich 
and there s
just no end to them 
now a good portion
of them i own 
but the biggest piece
is right there 
and i don t have a thing
to do with it 
but i aim to 
i sure enough
aim to 
guess who s   
olivia devereaux 
outstanding 
 100 million
in black gold
underneath that earth 
and you know what
she wants to do
with that land 
mr  harper 
she wants to turn it
into a goddamn
sanctuary for birds 
i think
that s kind of sweet 
well  now look  i m all
for saving wildlife
like the next fella 
but we got to think
about america s future 
energy sources
just aren t that easy
to come by 
uh huh  did you come
to that conclusion
out of patriotism
or just greed 
little of both 
mr  harper 
like
most men of wealth 
now  i guess you know
why i sent for you 
i have   
not here  not here 
a little privacy  huh 
just preliminaries 
preliminaries 
that s all 
now tell me 
why do you think
i sent for you 
can t say
that i know  captain 
but there
are some people
who think that
i work for you 
they ve been
reading my mind 
 cause
that s just exactly
what i wanted
you to do   
work for me 
i don t think
i could get used to it 
i think you d learn
to enjoy it 
i look at it this way 
mr  harper   
three people
are involved   
or should i say
could be involved   
with the title
to that land 
uh 
let s start with james 
it turns out 
through some
incredible good fortune 
i ve got a whole lot
of embarrassing material
of the visual kind
that  uh  could be used
regarding
james  unorthodox
sexual persuasions 
now
iris is another story 
you re a nice looking
young man 
oh  yeah 
and i
hear tell that iris   
well  bless her heart 
she likes
to play around a little 
you could be
most helpful with her 
mean a great deal to me 
and to you  too 
well  that still leaves
olivia  though  doesn t it 
that leaves olivia 
but you got that
figured out 
can i go now 
why  certainly 
uh  candy  mr  harper s
anxious to leave now 
well  what about
my proposal 
i ll give it
a lot of consideration 
and i m sure
we ll be hearing
from you soon  huh

the devereauxs 
one guess
who gets the shaft 
you still didn t
answer my question 
let me rephrase it 
what were you doing
at the devereauxs  yesterday 
schuyler and me
were getting it on 
so  what s the big deal 
the kid s got
a crush on me 
that s why i was fired 
oh  yeah  i thought it was
because of the letter
that you wrote
to iris  husband 
what letter 
i don t write letters 
all i know is that they
stuck it to me good 
i don t chase women 
buddy 
they chase me 
yeah  well  you ve certainly
got them running after you 
how do you do that  i mean 
you got a special wrinkle 
is it that your kinky pad
of yours
with all those mirrors
and everything 
creep  shut
your stupid mouth 
oh  wait a minute 
i m filled with admiration 
some guys just look good
in the locker room 
let s cut the crap 
o k

from me 
money 
there s plenty more
of that coming 
and you could be in
for a big piece 
half 
yeah   
if you get off my back 
yeah  but then we d
have to be friendly 
go to the same
restaurants and    nah 
what s the difference
to you 
c    come on  man 
move over 
get on the shoulder 
what shoulder 
there s nothing but
a swamp out there 
didn t i tell you 
big time 
it s not
your territory 
we want reavis 
he s my prisoner 
and i m bringing him in
with me 
you never got
a message 
mm mmm  nothing
on the blotter
except a common drunk
and a grand theft auto 
that s all 
maybe you called the wrong
police department 
well  if i did 
franks was on the other end
of that telephone 
where is old bullethead 
well  i was told
sick leave 
something about
a hunting accident 
be out the rest of
the week  at least 
oh  at least 
i ll bet he s got a sling
on his right arm  too 
what are you
trying to say 
you making some kind
of charge 
who do you think would
want to kill reavis 
oh  a lot of people 
lot of people 
olivia devereaux
was highly respected
in this community 
no matter what
her family thought
about her 
she was the leader of
a certain lifestyle 
a certain    order
which a lot of folk
around here
took comfort in 
so all those
blue haired ladies
from the bridge club
just went down
and bumped off
big bad pat 
that s your privilege
to think what you like 
uh  look  harper 
the devereauxs have
been through a lot 
i d just as soon
put a lid on
the whole thing 
i don t want iris
to get hurt   
or schuyler 
i m just  uh  worried
about my batting average 
what about it 
well  first my client s
mother in law gets it 
then    her daughter s
boyfriend 
uh uh 
uh uh 
you got it wrong 
schuyler had nothing
to do with pat reavis 
oh  come on  broussard 
you baby sit that girl 
you telling me
you don t know 
you know 
for a fast 150 a day 
you sure do a lot
of speculating 
the way you ve been chasing
after that teenybopper 
i think you want
to ball her yourself 
one more of those 
and i ll knock you right
through the wall 
you hear me 
now  as far as
i m concerned 
this case is closed 
who would want to do
a thing like that 
i got no answers 
i believed
you last time 
and look what
it got pat 
you re a cop 
aren t you 
well  second cousin 
i m a private 
bastard 
i let you soft soap me
into telling you
where pat lived 
and now he s dead 
you re a hell of a guy 
you know that 
you betcha 
all i was trying to do
was keep him alive 
so justice could
triumph  no doubt 
hey  i got no idea
what justice is 
i am interested
in truth  though 
oh  that s a laugh 
all right  not the big
philosophical stuff 
the everyday things like
who  why  when  where 
i ll tell you what 
i m interested in why
pat reavis was killed 
and i m interested
in why i got roughed up
for something that was
supposed to be hidden
in his place
in the quarter 
an account book 
you want me to try
to find out who killed him 
what good s that
going to do him 
no good at all   
except i think
he d understand 
what makes you so sure
that i have
the account book 
because it wasn t where
it was supposed to be 
and i think you re
the only person he trusts 
i don t know why
i should help you 
i don t know
why i should   
even listen to you 
hey  don t 
got a beer 
help yourself 
thanks 
you got any idea
what you got here 
he told me just to
keep it for him 
not to look in it 
well  let me tell you
something 
old jay hue kilbourne
kicked back to
a lot of lawmakers
to get those
oil leases of his 
whoo 
oh  boy  could this
make justice triumph 
keep it for me 
will you 
help me out  o k  
how d you like
to help me
put on some
suntan lotion 
wouldn t help  honey 
you re going to be
burned out
by the time you re 30 
i m looking
for your mama 
she s down at the bayou 
i thought private eyes
only read mystery stories 
who told you i was
a private eye 
mr  harper 
did you tell her 
i got pretty tired
of seeing you hanging
around  harper 
so iris explained to me
about that stupid note
the chauffeur wrote 
like it was something
i give a damn about 
i told her to get you
the hell out 
i m sure she ll want
to say goodbye 
well   
what do you know 
i think i ve
just been fired 
oh  really  by whom 
the master
of the house 
well  that s nice 
that s the first
positive action
he s taken in years 
he can t fire me 
i ve ruined a perfectly
good suit 
and i ve run up
800 bucks in expenses 
you are incredible 
lew 
you have a problem 
you have no talent
for surrender 
yeah 
i guess i got this wild
selfish streak in me 
i m going to be sued
by that rent a car
company  too 
you know 
go away 
why don t you learn
to give up things gracefully 
i can t 
i know who wrote
that letter 
schuyler 
what makes you think that 
it s right out
of her schoolbook 
reavis was a
functioning illiterate 
for christ s sake  she
had him sounding like
a 17th century
lyric poet 
you re lying  why do you
think she d do that 
i don t think
you know a lot
about your daughter 
iris 
what are you trying
to do to me 
what is she trying
to do to you 
pat reavis was killed 
the question is 
who killed him and why 
things are getting
pretty ugly around here 
i don t much
care for it 
but fired or not 
i m going to stick it
through to the end   
and people may not like
everything i find 
you understand 
doesn t really matter 
oh 
aah  aah 
how was your
vacation  franks 
christ 
i understand you had
an unfortunate
hunting accident 
you know that you assaulted
a police officer 
not important 
i don t think broussard
likes you anymore 
where s your
mardi gras mask 
i don t know what
you re talking about 
i ain t got no time
to mess around 
let s start
from the top 
how much did kilbourne
pay you to kill reavis

pull that trigger 
you big city boys

in rules 
oh  boy

kilbourne pay you 
i don t have to
say nothing 
i know my rights and
the miranda decision 
two 
god damn 
god damn it 
are you crazy 
right  want
to play again 
kilbourne always pays me
a little something
whenever he needs
a favor done 
how much did he pay you
to kill reavis 
no  i ll have my ass
in a sling if   
three 
you son of a bitch 
 5 000 
god damn 
why did he
want him dead 
i don t know

i tell you  i don t know 
i swear to the almighty 
i don t know  honest

is say the magic word 
and you re dog food 
let him aboard  candy 
hello  mr  harper 
i been hoping
to see you 
some tub you got here 
jay hue 
just one
of my fun fleet 
now  please don t think
i m inhospitable 
nothing but vandals
everywhere 
those puppy dogs sure

you come on inside 
i don t believe

it s a pleasure
meeting you 
mr  harper 
sweet child 
uh  sit down 
mr  harper 
one of my other
passions 
cooking 
this is shrimp étouffé 
local favorite 
but my version 
uh  could i get you
a drink 
yeah  a little
of that glenlivet
might hit the spot 
outstanding 
a man who knows
his liquor 
free pour 
i ve got this
bad old stomach 
and i can t touch
a thing but cereals 
what do you do
with all the food 
dump it overboard 
of course 
fish seem to
enjoy it immensely 
want a taste 
uh  not this trip  no 
just as well 
it needs to   
set a bit 
can the fish
really tell 
ha ha  i expect
they can 
now   
what can i do for you 
mr  harper 
the devereaux oil lease 
i d like a pretty
big chunk of that 
i m sorry  mr  harper 
along with my bad
old stomach 
i m    i m having trouble
with my hearing lately 
uh huh 
well  jay hue 
we can be friends 
reavis showed me
the 10 grand you paid him
to kill
old lady devereaux 
i m afraid reavis
is dead  mr  harper 
yeah  that he is 
that he is 
but franks ain t 
and he told me
about the 5 grand
you paid him to kill reavis 
i mean  i think
that s kind of neat 
there s not many people
who can afford
to hire a killer
and then hire a cop
to kill him 
i hate to be
a spoilsport 
mr  harper   
you doing all that
good figuring   
but i did not hire
reavis
to kill
olivia devereaux 
he was in your employ 
you bought him when he was
the devereaux chauffeur 
he was my spy 
an industrial spy 
happens all the time 
just good business 
when reavis hit me
with that first
installment of  10 000
to keep quiet
about a murder
i had absolutely
nothing to do with   
tried to implicate me
in it   
well   
let s just say i   
was not unhappy
when he   
met with that most
unfortunate accident 
mm hmm 
i ran a check on you 
mr  harper 
you are not stupid 
i have my moments 
you want to live

social security payments
for nothing

everyone knows she was

of seconal and liquor 
this was no accident 
that s a logical
assumption 
isn t it  mr  harper 
beats me 
who found her 
schuyler found her
this morning and called me 
schuyler  where is she 
they were quite
fond of one another 
you know  touching   
get him the hell
out of here 
come on 
come on 
what the hell
am i doing with these 
she tell you about us 
she didn t have to 
god  what a mistake i made 
i should have taken her away
from here a long time ago 
i didn t know what to do 
i didn t know
where to go 
i was just a kid 
she was from
the finest family 
17 years ago  things
were a lot different 
i m   
i m so tired 
i m so tired 
so goddamn tired 
giving grandma s birds
a holiday  huh 
why not 
they can go anywhere
they want now 
that s a bad move 
they won t
make it out there 
tough 
the old lady was
a lot nicer to birds
than she was
to people  huh 
that s right  california 
schuyler  i got all
the big stuff figured 
but it s tying up those
tiny  little loose ends
that s driving me
up the wall 
i mean  i know about
you and reavis 
i saw you skulking
around in the bushes
out there
and i saw his car 
so what 
you re right 
not relevant 
well  what
i was getting at   
you know  as bad
a frame job as it was   
see  loose end   
how did you manage
to lift reavis  wallet 
you re making it up
anyway 
use your imagination 
what do you mean  wha   
while you were
doing it with him 
hey 
that s pretty neat   
all that passion
and light fingers
at the same time 
ooh 
oh  my goodness gracious 
strong 
ow 
i can t believe
how strong you are 
it must come
from all that swimming 
ow 
oh  now  what did you hit
that sweet
old lady so hard for 
you re not a messy kid
normally  are you 
or did you just
get carried away 
let go of me 
next thing    iris 
i figured a while back
that you wrote the letter 
but that was
just the kickoff 
wasn t it  what was
the whole game plan 
shut up 
hey  you heard
iris and me
on the phone
last night 
she was pretty low 
i know you heard us
because
after she hung up 
there was
a second click 
click goes the phone 
you go to her room 
wait a minute 
don t get me wrong 
i know you didn t shove
those sleeping pills
down her throat 
but you sure fixed it
so she d do the job
for you  didn t you 
i don t have to listen
to any of this 
whoa  another loose end 
what did you tell her  huh 
about all those kinky things
you had going with reavis 
or maybe you described
how you killed the old lady 
or worse   
maybe you just told her
how miserable you were
going to make
the rest of her life 
they really
did a job on him 
who  your dad 
i hated her  i hated
both of those bitches 
and you got rid
of both of them
so you could have daddy
all to yourself  huh 
like i said  you re
a pretty bright kid 
but what are
you going to do
with all
that information 
nobody s going
to believe you 
well   
that s a funny thing
