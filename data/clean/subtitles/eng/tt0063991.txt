 appreciative sigh 
woman visitor  what are those
little red stickers in the corners

  hey  that one doesn t have a sticker 
  yeah 
i wonder why that one
hasn t been sold 
  it s a tapestry 
  yeah 
it s very nice 
i think it s good 
it ll look good in that place
above the fireplace  you know 
look  it s not too big
and it s not too small 
i guess so 
  i wonder what they want for it 
  well  how should i know 
well  find out  can t you 
hey  miss  er   
i was wondering
about these pictures here 
i imagine they re worth a buck or two 
i mean  do they rate high 
well  that s a matter of opinion  isn t it 
as you can see 
most of them have been sold 
well  er    this one hasn t 
  i like it 
  yes 
yes  you won t find
a better brad morahan than that 
actually  there is someone after it 
but it hasn t been sold   
yet 
er    how much is it 
this one  just let me find out 
tai  tai 
 discreet coughing 
this one s five 
husband 
five  eh 
five thousand 
dollars 
it s    it s very nice 
perhaps you d like
to talk it over together 
well  dear   
godfrey 
excuse m   
i see it hasn t gone yet 
no  no  it hasn t  not actually 
well  it has now 
let me see 
you said five for this one  didn t you 
uh huh 
good  it s a deal 
i suppose you want to keep it
until the end of the exhibition 
well  yes  yes  i do 
well  you can t  bubeleh 
i got a buyer for it already 
  it is sold 
  yes 
it was really marvellous  wasn t it 
yes  it was quite a good one 
i could never understand
why nobody bought it 
bradley morahan
does something to me 
maybe it s because he s an australian 
 but he seems to have a vision   
  brad  brad  wait a minute  brad 
was that him 
if somebody had told me
when i first wanted to be a painter
that i d end up living the way i do 
i d never have started 
i might just as well
be making chronometers 
i sit here all day
in this bloody little studio 
meticulously devising
these things that i make 
beautiful things  brad  lovely things 
brad 
beautiful  yes  clever 
beautiful and cheap at the price 
godfrey  that s a load of bull 
there isn t a painter alive who s worth
the fancy prices that you charge 
it s just lucky for you that people have a
blind faith in what they don t understand 
you need a holiday 
i started painting because it was my way
of responding to the things that i love 
light  colour  life 
people  sensuality 
but i m out of touch with them now 
i m indoors behind bars 
and i want to get out 
i suppose you ll think it in bad taste
for me to mention it 
but i must point out
that your share alone
from the november exhibition
will come to  30 000 
and with your chronic alimony situation 
i m sure you can use it 
godfrey  my friend 
i find you revolting 
take your sketchbook 
you just don t want
to understand  do you 
this isn t a
bloody sketching expedition 
  could we have a forwarding address 
  australia
