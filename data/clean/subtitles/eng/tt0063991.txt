i guess so
i wonder what they want for it
well how should i know
well find out cant you
hey miss er
i was wondering
about these pictures here

i mean do they rate high
well thats a matter of opinion isnt it
as you can see
most of them have been sold

a better brad morahan than that

until the end of the exhibition
well yes yes i do
well you cant bubeleh
i got a buyer for it already
it is sold
yes
it was really marvellous wasnt it
yes it was quite a good one
i could never understand
why nobody bought it
bradley morahan
does something to me
maybe its because hes an australian
but he seems to have a vision
brad brad wait a minute brad
was that him
if somebody had told me
when i first wanted to be a painter
that id end up living the way i do
id never have started
i might just as well
be making chronometers
i sit here all day
in this bloody little studio
meticulously devising
these things that i make
beautiful things brad lovely things
brad
beautiful yes clever
beautiful and cheap at the price
godfrey thats a load of bull
there isnt a painter alive whos worth
the fancy prices that you charge
its just lucky for you that people have a
blind faith in what they dont understand
you need a holiday
i started painting because it was my way
of responding to the things that i love
light colour life
people sensuality
but im out of touch with them now
im indoors behind bars
and i want to get out
i suppose youll think it in bad taste
for me to mention it
but i must point out
that your share alone
from the november exhibition
will come to 30000
and with your chronic alimony situation
im sure you can use it
godfrey my friend
i find you revolting
take your sketchbook
you just dont want
to understand do you
this isnt a
bloody sketching expedition
could we have a forwarding address
australia
yes i saw that one coming
could you be a little more specific
