you don t want to be my partner 
you don t know that 
your dad s the reason

he s why i wanted to do this
in the first place 
and i m not him 
prepare to be underwhelmed 
banks and schenk   
some homeless guy got hit
by the 3 train  you re up 
detective peterson 
pick up 2 2 1 
detective peterson  2 2 1 
this is you 
beats the squad car 
detective banks
en route to that 10 19 
would that be north
or south side of the street 
  northbound 
  copy that 
what are you doing 
oh  it s just family 
this is my wife  emma 
this is my son  charlie 
they re cute 
enjoy it while it lasts 
 while it lasts  
nothing happier than the wife
of a new detective 
and nothing more angry
than that same bitch
10 years later 
maybe it s  cause
you call them bitches 
i m half italian  trust me 
women do not like it
when you call them bitches   
what are you telling me
about women 
young motherfucker  shit 
i just said it to you 
i didn t say it to a woman 
i don t say it to their face 
it s not like i m too short 
we just met  but  you know 
you re firing already  and i appreciate it 
i mean  all i m saying is 
you know 
most crime happens
on weekends  holidays 
so you would think
anybody married to a cop
would understand this 
but no 
one day  your wife will be angry
 cause you couldn t go to
her sister s birthday dinner 
you can give a woman
600 tuesdays 
it ain t worth
three saturday nights 
so  uh    i m guessing
you re divorced 
divorced  no  not yet 
i m going through a divorce 
that s even worse 
it s kind of like chemo 
shit  sorry 
sorry for what  we re cops 
this is the life we choose 
highest divorce rate 
highest suicide rate 
highest rate
of domestic violence 
yo  when you decided
to become a cop 
you pretty much assured yourself
you were gonna die alone 
my wife and i 
we re doing this counseling 
she s got me  uh  working on 
like  communication 
counseling 
yeah  that s nice 
yeah  my wife
fucked the counselor 
fuck  really 
  yeah 
  jesus 
women cheat  too

women cheat in the daytime 
you can get away with
a lot of shit in the daytime 
that s right  you can ride
  a lot of dick before dusk 
  mmm hmm

the metro police 
to remind them of their oath
to the people of this city 
one officer from your station
refused to be reformed 
he will not be the last
to play my game 
if that spiral
is what i think it is   
jigsaw 
wait  i thought
the jigsaw killer was dead 
yeah  but if it s
another copycat   
it s gonna be a shit show 
i recognize that building

bleeding from the mouth badly 
the package was sent
from a delivery service
that picked it up
on a stoop on anglin drive 
what about the spirals 
hey  cap  obviously
it s a jigsaw copycat 
so that s where we got to
concentrate our focus

to stick with hard evidence 
kraus  contact the feds 
get anything they got 
files  old videos  anything 
do we have street images 
we re working on it

meth isn t the type of thing
you take a break from 
besides  you see that device 
that was not designed
by anybody with rotten teeth 
what do you think about
this whole jigsaw angle 
you think it s a  what do you call them 
one of those disciples 
john kramer
didn t target cops 
whoever did this
has another motive 
something personal 
and they re not
following orders 
especially the orders
of a ghost 
ghost or not 
somebody s out there
pulling all the strings 
you think this guy
sent you the boxes
because you re the
lead detective on the case 
or because you re you 
i don t know 
well  you got any enemies 
that aren t cops 
i don t know why she
won t give me another chance 
i don t know  maybe
it s because you beat her
when you drink too much 
you ever think of that 
that s some tough love 
who the hell is this guy 
ex cop 
partner snitched on him 
had to do nine years
hard time 
the system spit him out 
now here he is 
hey  pete

we were out of control 
cops were given their own
discretion to crack down on crime 
where were you july 4th

god loves you  zeke 
more than you 
can t believe
that guy used to be a cop 
he shot an innocent guy 
but you turned on him

of your life watching your back

hello  detective schenk 
i want to play a game 
you were head of your class
at the police academy 
he was obviously skinned   
postmortem 
your dad s the reason i wanted
to do this in the first place 
   the body was scored first
to remove the pieces
in larger strips 
arms  neck 
as he ripped the skin   
maybe it s a good thing
they made us partners 
even the defensive wounds 
he clearly tried to fight back 
which explains
the deeper gashes 
captain  over here 
is it a serial killer
targeting cops 
is the victim inside
a policeman 
no comment  commissioner hart
will make a statement tonight 
we got to try
to keep his identity
out of the press
until i tell his wife

to clean up the streets 
it was crazy
back then  right 
we were working
under article 8 
we were out of control 
murder rate went way down 
that s fucking bullshit 
people felt safe again 
the streets got cleaner
because the cops got dirtier 
your dad oversaw
the whole thing  by the way 
innocent people getting shot 
all in the name of justice 
article 8 was
one of the most corrupt
police policies in history 
and guess who was
your dad s right hand man 
sorry  or should i say woman 
the whole time 
we ll handle it 
we always do  huh 
angie 
angie

her stellar reputation
that got her a precinct

shoot first 
ask questions later 
you watched my father die
and i m trying to save yours 
if we re going to trust
each other 
i need you to do this 
ezekiel   
you ve always done
the right thing  do it now 
this piece of shit
is killing cops

motive  something personal 
whoever did this
