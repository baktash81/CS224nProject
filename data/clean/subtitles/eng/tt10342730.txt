this whole jigsaw angle
you think its a whatdoyoucallthem
one of those disciples
john kramer
didnt target cops
whoever did this
has another motive
something personal
and theyre not
following orders
especially the orders
of a ghost
ghost or not
somebodys out there
pulling all the strings
you think this guy
sent you the boxes
because youre the
lead detective on the case
or because youre you
i dont know
well you got any enemies
that arent cops
i dont know why she
wont give me another chance
i dont know maybe
its because you beat her
when you drink too much
you ever think of that
thats some tough love
who the hell is this guy
excop
partner snitched on him
had to do nine years
hard time
the system spit him out
now here he is

eighteen months sober
living in a church basement
who could ask
for anything more
whos this
detective schenk
were working a case together
working together
dont let this guy
catch you jaywalking
or hell stab you
right in the fucking back
dont forget pete
you gave me the knife
youre right i did
and you witnessed this cop
throw the victim
off a rooftop
and you saw it
i mean with your own eyes
and you can positively id
this cop
hes had his foot on the neck of
this community for way too long
we cant have this
ill testify

he pulled a gun on me
the witness

i was mad for a long time
but now i take responsibility
i should have never
pulled the trigger
the guy had a family
it was crazy back then right
we were working
under article 8
we were out of control
cops were given their own
discretion to crack down on crime
where were you july 4th
at 930 pm

thats what youre here for
thats what im here for
look some guy came
to a meeting drunk
and wanted to fight a sponsor
so i hit him
knocked him clean out
anyway the cops came
im still on probation
but lucky for me
it was obrien
he let the whole thing slide
because you know
loyalty
loyalty
take care pete
god loves you zeke
more than you
cant believe
that guy used to be a cop
he shot an innocent guy
but you turned on him
theres a code and you better
learn how to follow it

oh my god
anything
well were
analyzing the tape recording
hello detective schenk
i want to play a game
you were head of your class
at the police academy
he was obviously skinned
postmortem
your dads the reason i wanted
to do this in the first place
the body was scored first
to remove the pieces
in larger strips
arms neck
as he ripped the skin
maybe its a good thing
they made us partners
even the defensive wounds
he clearly tried to fight back
which explains
the deeper gashes
captain over here
is it a serial killer
targeting cops
is the victim inside
a policeman
no comment commissioner hart
will make a statement tonight

shit you did under article 8
whats he talking about
times running out
whats he talking about
citizens were dying
we did what we had to
to clean up the streets
it was crazy
back then right
we were working
under article 8
we were out of control
murder rate went way down
thats fucking bullshit
people felt safe again
the streets got cleaner
because the cops got dirtier
your dad oversaw
the whole thing by the way
innocent people getting shot
all in the name of justice
article 8 was
one of the most corrupt
police policies in history
and guess who was
your dads righthand man
sorry or should i say woman
the whole time
well handle it
we always do huh
angie

her stellar reputation

because thats what cops do
shoot first
ask questions later
you watched my father die
and im trying to save yours
if were going to trust
each other
i need you to do this
ezekiel
youve always done
the right thing do it now
this piece of shit
is killing cops
you still need to decide
you can shoot me or
or you can save your dad
clocks ticking man

any favors for your old man
only you can do that
