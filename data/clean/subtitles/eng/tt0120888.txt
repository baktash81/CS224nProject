very nice 
good job  lady 
you were shakin  
it is gonna be fun today 
the best man s gonna come up
and say a few words   
so let s put our hands together
for the groom s brother david 
all right  dave 
when my brother harold
asked me to be the best man   
i was like 
 whoa  of course  man   
 because you ve always
been there for me  
like when i was in rehab   
and like the time
i couldn t find my car 
 cause  harold  he s always been
the dependable one 
i ve always been
the screwed up one  right  dad 
 why can t you
be more like your brother 
 harold would never
beat up his landlord  
he s drunk as shit 
but   
a little news flash  pop 
harold ain t so perfect 
remember that time
in puerto rico   
when we picked up those two   
i guess they were prostitutes 
but i don t remember paying 
how about that 
terrific 
i m a person  too 
pop  goddamn it 
you re a moron 
the best man  everybody 
best man  the better man 
we ve all done crazy things
in our life  so   
he s playing the guitar now 
isn t that great 
he s doing good 
sounds good 
it s because i m the best
guitar player in the world 
self taught 
no lessons 
thank you very much  pop 
all right 
they ll be divorced in a year 
very good 
i think we all know
that when you fall in love   
the emptiness
kind of drifts away 
that s all i m talking about 
i ve done some crazy things
in my life  too   
but then i met
a very special girl   
a girl who i m actually
marrying next week 
thank you 
so all i m saying is that
when you fall in love   
the emptiness drifts away   
because you find something
to live for   
each other 
and the way
i ve seen you two   
looking into each other s
eyes all day long   
i can tell that you re
gonna live for each other   
for the rest of your lives 
so cheers 
that s a good
wedding singer 
now on behalf of
mr  and mrs  harold veltri   
you guys have a nice dinner 
george stitzer s gonna take over
on lead vocals   
so take it away  george 
give me time   
to realize my crime 
let me love and stay 
 jesus

she s holly sullivan s cousin 
if she s

i ll close this deal
by the end of the week 
i don t think
that s gonna happen 
please  it s her first day 
always takes them three weeks   
to realize they shouldn t
date anyone at work 
you like being the guy
that helps them realize that 
yes  i do 
you want to be like fonzie

to make me cry 
prime rib  please

andre

your wish is my command  madame 
how come he s so nice to you 
i let him look at my boobs
at the christmas party 
not my finest half hour   
but it s been a pleasant
working environment ever since 
so  how s your first night
going 
being at this wedding
is making me realize   
that glenn is never
going to set a date   
and i ve been wearing
this ring for two years   
and i feel like an idiot 
you know what you must do 
relax  don t do it 
i feel stupid for moving here
to be closer to him 
i think you need a break 
go out back and get some air 
i ll cover your tables 
you ok 
you going to throw up 
come with me  man 
give me time   
what 
here we go 
come on 
you got it  there 
is he a friend of yours 
me  no 
i couldn t let him do it
in front of his family 
wow 
i m glad i got to see it 
you all through 
going to wait a few years
before you drink again 
all right  remember 
alcohol equals puke   
equals smelly mess
equals nobody likes you 
i got it from here 
know what  you go this way 
and you go this way 
it s for the best 
it s all right  take it easy 
see you later 
sleep it off  pal 
hey  you know 
wedding singer 
are you drinking  too 
no  it s coca cola 
are you sure  there s
no rum in that coca cola 
i m not a big drinker   
and if it was  i d be puking
more than that kid 
i don t think anybody could
puke more than that kid 
i think i saw a boot come out 
you re the wedding singer 
how you doing  i m robbie 
i m julia 
i m actually waitressing
at your wedding next week 
cool  that s a beautiful ring
you have there 
are you getting married  too 
actually  i don t know
how serious the guy is   
who gave this to me 
i feel like i m doomed to wander
the planet alone forever 
like the incredible hulk 
yeah   only
i m not helping people 
that s not true 
because i saw you inside 
you were helping people 
you were giving them
fish and coffee and forks 
people can t eat without forks 
and they can t
drink without a fish 
that s right 
what does that mean 
i don t know 
you lost me back at the hulk 
robbie  you better
get back in there 
they re starting
to turn on george 
 sit down 
 you suck 
he s got to learn a new song 
but it was nice to meet you 
it was nice meeting you  too 
and if i ever get married 
maybe you ll sing at my wedding 
oh  man  it s a deal 
take care 
there was love   
all around   
but i never   
heard it singing 
very nice 
no  i never   
heard it at all   
pretty 
 til there was you 
much better 
you re going
to blow everybody away   
at your fiftieth
anniversary party 
if i sing to frank
without making any mistakes   
he would know
how hard i ve worked   
and how much i still love him
after all these years 
i hope 50 years from now   
linda and i are as happy
as you two guys 
you will be 
it runs in your family 
you re a born romantic 
just like your father was 
i know they ll be
looking down on you tomorrow 
i hope so 
are you nervous 
i m actually not
that nervous  you know 
i m at weddings all the time 
it s going to be fun 
not about the wedding  
about the wedding night 
will this be your first time
with intercourse 
don t be ashamed 
when i got married 
i wasn t a virgin 
i already had intercourse
with eight men 
that s actually something
i don t want to know about 
that was a lot back then 
that would be like 200 today 
it s 5 00 
i m going to get going 
but your payment 
my payment 
can i get it to go 
you re such a sweet boy   
letting an old woman
pay you with meatballs 
they taste so good 
it s like i m ripping you off 
i don t have
any clean tupperware 
all right 
definitely next time 
don t be silly 
now hold out your hands 
 you want to  
 do it 
cool 
thanks a lot 
now  please  take a bite   
so that i can
watch you enjoy 
that s my favorite part 
well   
i ll go with the right one 
that looks good 
that s a good meatball 
now  listen to me  robbie hart 
you re going to be
a fine husband 
i hope so  rosie  thank you 
i m going to leave 
i ll see you
at the wedding  all right 
thank you for coming in
and taking me to lunch 
look at the picture
of that girl  see that 
you re a lot prettier
than that girl   
and she s getting married 
what does pretty have to do
with getting married 
everything 
you got to get married   
before your hips start spreading
and you get facial hair   
which  by the way 
comes from your father s mother 
looks like magnum  p i  
for god s sake 
i can t make glenn set a date 
you re going to hate
this idea   
but i think you should consider
a fake pregnancy 
i m exiting the car 
it s just a means to an end 
ln five years 
he ll thank you for it 
perhaps we should call her 
she s probably got
a make up problem or her dress 
i know her 
she likes to look her best 
hey  sis 
hi  robs 
i just got off the phone
with linda s mom 
linda s not there  but   
there was a note 
a note 
everything all right 
yeah  she s ok 
it basically indicated   
that linda was   
not coming today 
so  it was a bad note 
did she say why 
i am so sorry  honey 
it s ok 
you want me to say something 
just give me a second 
i ll be right back 
oh  my god 
she s not showing up 
don t worry 
everything s gonna be all right 
it s ok 
oh  god 
you can t catch me 
i m going to get you
and chop you up 
can we turn this crap off 
please 
that s right  robbie 
you have to let it out 
 let what out 
 your feelings 
about what that lousy bitch
did to you today 
don t call her that   
because we re going
to get back together   
and then there will be weirdness
between you and me   
so just watch it 
i made this for you 
uncle robbie 
thanks  freddy krueger 
that s not nice 
very creative  though 
go back to the boiler room 
i just wish i knew
where she was  you know 
he s taking it pretty bad 
he s acting like a real robot   
a zombie or something 
he s been wanting to get married
since the third grade 
it makes sense 
that s when mom and dad died 
he wants to start
a family of his own 
check out the cake 
there s only
a little groom on top 
you re late 
i m sorry 
i just couldn t do it 
if you need some more time 
i guess i can wait 
no  i don t need
more time  robbie 
i don t ever want to marry you 
you know  that information   
might have been a little
more useful to me yesterday 
i ve been talking to my friends
the last couple of days   
here it comes 
and i think i figured out
what s been bothering me 
i m not in love with robbie now 
i m in love with robbie
six years ago   
robbie  the lead singer
of final warning   
when i used to come and
watch you from the front row   
in your spandex pants   
your silk shirt unbuttoned   
licking the microphone
like david lee roth 
i still got the spandex 
i ll put them on right now 
the point is 
i woke up this morning   
and i realized i m about
to marry a wedding singer 
i am never going
to leave ridgefield 
why do you need
to leave ridgefield 
we grew up here 
all our friends are here 
it s the perfect place
to raise a family 
living in your sister s
basement with five kids   
while you re off every
weekend doing wedding gigs   
at a whopping 60 bucks a pop 
once again   
things that could have been
brought to my attention   
yesterday 
the fact is 
we grew apart a long time ago 
you wanted to get married 
you didn t care to who 
that s not true  i love you 
come here 
i want to spend
the rest of my life with you 
hey  linda 
you re a bitch 
thanks  petey 
go back to the house 
he might have
tourette s syndrome 
we re looking into it 
i got to go 
i m sorry 
ninety nine luftballons   
glenn 
don t be so jumpy 
these are for you 
thank you 
they re beautiful 
i have something else for you 
two airplane tickets
to las vegas 
oh  my god  glenn 
i know you wanted
to set a date   
so i went to the travel agent
and set it 
glenn  i love you so much   
but las vegas  i thought  
jules  it s the romance
capital of the world 
i just don t want
a big wedding  
hundreds of people
we don t know   
that are just there
for the free drinks   
and all you can eat buffet 
they might as well be in vegas 
las vegas it is 
and it ll be great 
are you going to do
the girl thing 
you re going to act happy
and be pouting on the inside 
i m happy 
all right 
let s get married here 
i know that s what you want 
thank you  glenn 
it s more important
to you anyway 
i promise i will give you
the most beautiful wedding   
and even you ll have
a good time 
it s about time
his best friend showed up 
so  how s he doing 
i don t know 
he s been down in the basement
since it happened 
five days now 
i think he s having some kind
of a mental situation   
an episode or something 
all right 
you do something  because
i don t want to be known   
as the brother in law
of the town nut job 
i got enough problems already 
shit 
i got water all over myself 
hello 
you all right 
these sheets are soft 
you use downy 
all tempa cheer 
you can wash your clothes
at any temperature   
and the colors
don t run together 
 really 
 yeah  now leave me alone 
you have to go back to work 
there s going to be over
a hundred drunk girls   
at this wedding tonight 
i ve got nothing
to offer anybody 
i haven t done jack shit
since high school 
why would any girl
ever marry me 
marry you 
i m just trying to get someone
to play with your ding dong 
holiday   
celebrate   
if we took a holiday   
took some time to celebrate   
come on  let s celebrate 
just one day out of life   
it would be   
it would be so nice 
everybody spread the word 
i live in
my sister s basement 
he just had his heart broken 
why would he even think
about coming back to work 
i don t know 
celebrate 
you guys are off
to a great start 
i mean   
cindy showed up 
so  right away  scott   
you got to be pretty psyched 
i m not paying you to hear
your thoughts on life 
i m paying you to sing 
i have a microphone 
and you don t   
so you will listen
to every damn word   
i have to say 
it s funny  some of us
will never find true love 
like  take  for instance   me 
and i m pretty sure
that guy right there 
and that lady
with the sideburns 
and basically
everybody at table nine 
but the worst thing is   
that me  fatty 
sideburns lady   
and the mutants
over at table nine   
will never  ever find a way
to better the situation   
because   
apparently  we have
absolutely nothing to offer   
the opposite sex 
you are the worst wedding singer
in the world  buddy 
sir  one more outburst   
i will strangle you
with my microphone wire 
let s cut the stupid cake   
because the fat guy s
going to have a heart attack   
if we don t eat again soon 
and while we do that 
here s a little mood music 
cindy and scott are newlyweds 
he loves her   
but she loves
this guy right here   
and he loves somebody else 
you just can t win 
and so it goes   
until the day you die 
this thing they call love   
is gonna make you cry 
i hate you 
i ve had the blues   
the reds and the pinks 
one thing s for sure   
love stinks 
love stinks 
drug addict  degenerate 
i was wondering
what happened to you 
did everybody leave 
pretty much 
except for a few cops   
that are still interviewing
some witnesses 
i m going to get
the hell out of here 
so it was
your first wedding back 
of course things are going
to be a little shaky 
a little shaky 
i hate weddings 
i hate the bride 
i hate the groom 
i want them to be miserable 
because that s what i am 
no  you re the best 
at what  people eat
prime rib  and i sing 
it s a joke 
i can t do this anymore 
glenn and i set the date   
so you have to play our wedding 
congratulations 
i just can t do it  all right 
i m having an engagement party
in two weeks   
and i really want
you and sammy to come 
good  you re here 
robbie s here 
let s move it 
the kids have been fed 
but if they want snacks   
there s ice pops in the freezer 
or microwave popcorn

uncle robbie s here 
hey  the goofball brothers 
ls it true you re in the middle
of a nervous breakdown 
 who said that 
 everybody 
you re eight years old 
you only know your parents 
what are you talking about 
is it true you re gonna end up
in a mental institution 
cuckoo s nest 
hey  kids 
remember what we talked about 
go over there
and watch some television 
can i speak to you for a second 
everybody   
i ve been thinking
about what happened to you   
and it s all for the best 
i know you were
in love and everything   
but that wears off 
me and your sister 
we used to be wild 
she was very adventurous   
and we got into some crazy shit 
but now the thrill is gone 
if we get a second alone 
we usually go to sleep 
if it s a special occasion   
she might do
this exotic dance for me 
what 
sometimes she might
work with my nipples a bit 
all right  enough  go out 
i ll take care of the kids 
i don t know what i just said 
but i said something 
women got a thing
about marriage 
if you want to stay with them 
you re gonna have to marry them 
no big deal  there she is 
the girl who finally beat me
into submission 
that s right 
august 5th
is less than three months away 
we ve got a lot of planning
to do 
do you think
it would be better   
if maybe you took over
all the arrangements 
i d like to do it together 
yeah  but you like this stuff 
it s really not my thing 
god forbid i screw up
the wedding flowers 
how could i live with myself

to talk about that 
i don t know

julia  thanks for inviting us 
i m glad you guys came 
we hang out at work so much

this guy saw you   
he told me
he was gonna hit on you 
 really 
 that s not true 
yeah  it is 
you told me she was in trouble 
she was gonna get it 
and she didn t even know it 
he s teasing 
i would never say that 
you said you were
gonna give it to her 
give me what  exactly 
you re a jerk 
what do you mean 
you didn t know she was engaged 
so now you re not
gonna give it to me 
very funny 
say hi to your brother tito 
so how are you doing 
i m doing better  i don t know

with the wedding plans 
glenn isn t really  
he s very busy right now 
he works on wall street 
you know how that is nowadays 
wall street  stocks and stuff

he barely has time to sleep 
let alone plan a wedding   
so i m kind of doing this
on my own 
but i went to marshall s

that my demands are small 
say it s me
that you ll adore   
for now and ever more 
that s all 
to the new lord of the ladies 
you re a lovely dancer 
 are you gonna tell glenn 
 about what 
about you and that kid
and him squeezing your tush 
he did have very strong
hands for a 13 year old 
i could see that 
by the way  thank you for
recommending tony the florist 
his flowers were beautiful 
and he didn t overcharge me 
good  i m glad 
and a new girl in town   
could certainly use that kind
of help on everything 
you got holly
and your mother  right 
my mother lives 50 miles away   
and holly s
not into that kind of thing   
so that really only leaves
one person 
i would  but  you know 
i just  l can t 
i understand 
i just don t know
how to go about this 
i m afraid i m gonna pay  500
for a half eaten wedding cake 
i really gotta concentrate
on getting some more gigs 
there s only four jewish
families in this town 
all right 
i have never done it
for that cheap 
i know for a fact you gave
eric lamensoft that price 
i did not 
faye  look at me 
look me in the eyes 
i m right here 
don t look away  did you
give him that price or not 
ok  just that one time 
so you got me 
can i say something 
i deal with a lot of people 
but you two look truly happy 
you re gonna make it 
i know  believe me 
how do you know 
you can just look at a couple   
and you can tell right away   
they re gonna
stay together forever 
like donald and ivana   
and woody and mia   
and burt and loni 
we re not getting married 
that s right  actually 
we re brother and sister 
so that s it 
i could sense a closeness 
the weird thing is 
when we were growing up   
we didn t get along  cause
i used to do this to her 
we re gonna go now

or   should i thank linda 
my business has tripled 
you ve just inspired
me to hire a d j   
so thank you 
good luck finding a d j  who can
move and shake like this 
how did you become
a wedding singer 
i think i got into it
to make some money   
until my music career took off 
and you wanted to be
a rock star 
i kind of just wanted
to be a songwriter  you know 
that s the hardest thing 
to write a song 
a song that
when people hear it   
they go   ohh  i know
what that guy was feeling   
 when he wrote that  
have you written anything
lately 
yeah  i guess 
will you play it for me 
you don t want to hear it 
it s not good 
i m sure it is 
i wrote half of it
when i was with linda   
and i wrote the other half
after we broke up   
so it s a little uneven 
you know 
i don t mind 
i d like to hear it 
yeah  all right 
i just want to warn you
that when i wrote this song   
i was listening
to the cure a lot  so   
here we go 
you don t know   
how much   
i need you 
while you re near me   
i don t feel blue 
and when we kiss   
i know you need me  too 
i can t believe
i found a love   
that s so pure and true   
but it all was bullshit 
it was a goddamn joke   
and when
i think of you  linda   
i hope you fuckin  choke 
i hope you re glad   
with what you ve done to me 
i lay in bed   
all day long   
feeling melancholy 
you left me here   
all alone   
tears running constantly 
oh  somebody kill me  please 
i m on my knees 
pretty  pretty please 
kill me 
i want to die 
put a bullet in my head 
i liked it 
he s losing his mind   
and i m reaping
all the benefits 
thank you for the ice cream 
it always cheers me up 
it s my pleasure 
i feel weird
being in this place 
we came here all the time 
we used to get chocolate shakes 
may i ask what happened
with linda 
she wasn t the right one 
i guess 
did you have any idea
she wasn t the right one   
when you were together 
i should have 
i remember we went
to the grand canyon once 
we were flying there 
and i d never been before   
and linda had 
so you would think   
that she would give me
the window seat   
but she didn t 
not that that s a big deal 
you know 
but there were a lot of
little things like that 
 l know that sounds stupid 
 not at all 
i think it s
the little things that count 
how did you know
that glenn was the right one 
the right one 
i always just envisioned
the right one   
being someone i could
see myself growing old with 
and glenn will be a really
good looking older man   
like blake carrington 
i m gonna probably
look like buddy hackett 
of course
i m gonna hire him 
he s your best friend and
the only limo driver in town 
yeah  i just like
having fun with him 
wow  look at him go 
better move it  man 
you re not gonna make it 
you hit 2 cones 
those could have been people 
those could have been
guests at her wedding 
they were cones 
that was fun today 
wasn t that fun 
that was fun 
 l got the job  right 
 yeah  you did 
it s august 5th 
a week from today 
someone left a jacket
in the back 
that s julia s jacket 
remember 
she took it off on noxon street 
she said it s not
jacket weather anymore 
 uh oh 
 what 
 you like her 
 no  i don t 
of course you do  she s
a cool chick with a hot ass 
you talk about her ass again 
i ll break your neck 
anyway  she told me
she likes you 
really 
she said that 
think about it 
it s gonna be your first
kiss as a married couple 
it s perfectly acceptable
to open your mouth 
i just would not want
to do that in a church   
in front of god
and all of our relatives 
it would gross them out
to see me like   
no one will ever solve that 
you forgot
your jacket in the limo 
thank you for bringing it back 
that s so nice of you 
yeah  it was 
i ll see you later  all right 
have fun today 
hey  wait a second 
maybe   he can help us 
you re the expert on this 
we were just having a debate
about wedding kisses 
i say that it s ok for it
to be an open mouth kiss 
and i say that it s
the type of occasion   
where people dress up 
so it s not appropriate 
 l see 
 what do you want to do 
thin  tight mouth 
and it s over 
no  thin  partially open 
no tongues  over 
no tongue  please  there
has got to be a little 
maybe a little tongue 
not porno tongue 
church tongue 
church tongue  i like that 
church tongue  what is that 
i don t know
how to describe it 
well  show me 
not on me 
how about on him 
you don t mind  do you 
come on  just hold still 
julia  go ahead 
come on 
we re all adults here 
i m gonna have to see it
to make an educated decision 
well  if it s for
educational purposes 
good  ok 
all right  you ready 
i now pronounce you
husband and wife 
you may kiss the bride 
wow 
that   was   great 
julia  you should do that
at the wedding 
i gave her the jacket 
hey  jules  hey  holly 
i kissed her 
but it didn t mean anything 
i just brought her the jacket 
kissed who 
oh  me 
who hasn t 
i got you something 
it s called a cd player 
cost me 700 bucks   
but the sound quality
is outstanding 
you want to play a record 
jules  it doesn t play records 
it plays cds 
it s a cd player 
i ll be upstairs hooking it up 
oh  my god  robbie

i think
i should go out with him

you re single  and he s single 
it makes sense 
if you don t want me to 
i won t do it 
why would i not want you to 
good  then i m going out
with him 
who you going out with

that guy needs to get laid 
excuse me

jules is chums with him 
she ll fix it up  won t you 
you know what would be fun 
let s go on a double date 
robbie

i like these rubber bracelets 
you look like madonna 
yeah  that s the idea 
here you go 
so  robbie 
how s your business going 
i m actually working
on a game plan right now 
you should look
into the bond market 
 that s where the money is 
 glenn s in junk bonds 
no  jules 
it s high yield bonds 
do i tell people
you re in junk waitressing 
my grandmother gave me
a savings bond when i was a kid 
i get  25 in 1993

so we totally
look like a couple 
don t you think
we look great together

or did he kiss you 
i kissed him 
and then what 
nothing 
he sure doesn t
think much of glenn  though 
really  what did he say 
that glenn s a jerk off 
why would he say that 
who knows 
maybe he was jealous 
don t worry  i told him
why you were marrying him 
why did you tell him
i was marrying him 
because you love him   
and because   
because with glenn 
you ll have security
