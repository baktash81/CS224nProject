very nice
good job lady
you were shakin
it is gonna be fun today
the best mans gonna come up
and say a few words
so lets put our hands together
for the grooms brother david
all right dave
when my brother harold
asked me to be the best man
i was like
whoa of course man
because youve always
been there for me
like when i was in rehab
and like the time
i couldnt find my car
cause harold hes always been
the dependable one
ive always been
the screwedup one right dad
why cant you
be more like your brother
harold would never
beat up his landlord
hes drunk as shit
but
a little news flash pop
harold aint so perfect
remember that time
in puerto rico
when we picked up those two
i guess they were prostitutes
but i dont remember paying
how about that
terrific
im a person too
pop goddamn it
youre a moron
the best man everybody
best man the better man
weve all done crazy things
in our life so
hes playing the guitar now
isnt that great
hes doing good
sounds good
its because im the best
guitar player in the world
selftaught
no lessons
thank you very much pop
all right
theyll be divorced in a year
very good
i think we all know
that when you fall in love
the emptiness
kind of drifts away
thats all im talking about
ive done some crazy things
in my life too
but then i met
a very special girl
a girl who im actually
marrying next week
thank you
so all im saying is that
when you fall in love
the emptiness drifts away
because you find something
to live for
each other
and the way
ive seen you two
looking into each others
eyes all day long
i can tell that youre
gonna live for each other
for the rest of your lives
so cheers

wedding singer

working environment ever since
so hows your first night
going
being at this wedding
is making me realize
that glenn is never
going to set a date
and ive been wearing
this ring for two years
and i feel like an idiot
you know what you must do

i feel stupid for moving here
to be closer to him
i think you need a break
go out back and get some air
ill cover your tables
you ok
you going to throw up
come with me man
give me time
what
here we go
come on
you got it there
is he a friend of yours
me no
i couldnt let him do it
in front of his family
wow
im glad i got to see it
you all through
going to wait a few years
before you drink again
all right remember
alcohol equals puke
equals smelly mess
equals nobody likes you
i got it from here
know what you go this way
and you go this way
its for the best
its all right take it easy
see you later
sleep it off pal
hey you know
wedding singer
are you drinking too
no its cocacola
are you sure theres
no rum in that cocacola
im not a big drinker
and if it was id be puking
more than that kid
i dont think anybody could
puke more than that kid
i think i saw a boot come out
youre the wedding singer
how you doing im robbie
im julia
im actually waitressing
at your wedding next week
cool thats a beautiful ring
you have there
are you getting married too
actually i dont know
how serious the guy is
who gave this to me
i feel like im doomed to wander
the planet alone forever
like the incredible hulk
yeahonly
im not helping people
thats not true
because i saw you inside
you were helping people
you were giving them
fish and coffee and forks
people cant eat without forks
and they cant
drink without a fish
thats right
what does that mean
i dont know
you lost me back at the hulk
robbie you better
get back in there
theyre starting
to turn on george
sit down
you suck
hes got to learn a new song
but it was nice to meet you
it was nice meeting you too
and if i ever get married
maybe youll sing at my wedding
oh man its a deal
take care
there was love
all around
but i never
heard it singing
very nice
no i never
heard it at all
pretty
til there was you
much better
youre going
to blow everybody away
at your fiftieth
anniversary party
if i sing to frank
without making any mistakes
he would know
how hard ive worked
and how much i still love him
after all these years
i hope 50 years from now
linda and i are as happy
as you two guys
you will be
it runs in your family
youre a born romantic
just like your father was
i know theyll be
looking down on you tomorrow
i hope so
are you nervous
im actually not
that nervous you know
im at weddings all the time
its going to be fun
not about the wedding
about the wedding night
will this be your first time
with intercourse
dont be ashamed
when i got married
i wasnt a virgin
i already had intercourse
with eight men
thats actually something
i dont want to know about
that was a lot back then
that would be like 200 today
its 500
im going to get going
but your payment
my payment
can i get it to go
youre such a sweet boy
letting an old woman
pay you with meatballs
they taste so good
its like im ripping you off
i dont have
any clean tupperware
all right
definitely next time
dont be silly
now hold out your hands
you want to
do it
cool
thanks a lot
now please take a bite
so that i can
watch you enjoy
thats my favorite part
well
ill go with the right one
that looks good
thats a good meatball
now listen to me robbie hart
youre going to be
a fine husband
i hope so rosie thank you
im going to leave
ill see you
at the wedding all right
thank you for coming in
and taking me to lunch
look at the picture
of that girl see that
youre a lot prettier
than that girl
and shes getting married
what does pretty have to do
with getting married
everything
you got to get married
before your hips start spreading
and you get facial hair
which by the way
comes from your fathers mother
looks like magnum pi
for gods sake
i cant make glenn set a date
youre going to hate
this idea
but i think you should consider
a fake pregnancy
im exiting the car
its just a means to an end
ln five years
hell thank you for it
perhaps we should call her
shes probably got
a makeup problem or her dress
i know her
she likes to look her best
hey sis
hi robs
i just got off the phone
with lindas mom
lindas not there but
there was a note
a note
everything all right
yeah shes ok
it basically indicated
that linda was
not coming today
so it was a bad note
did she say why
i am so sorry honey
its ok
you want me to say something
just give me a second
ill be right back
oh my god
shes not showing up
dont worry
everythings gonna be all right
its ok
oh god
you cant catch me
im going to get you
and chop you up
can we turn this crap off
please
thats right robbie
you have to let it out
let what out
your feelings
about what that lousy bitch
did to you today
dont call her that
because were going
to get back together
and then there will be weirdness
between you and me
so just watch it
i made this for you
uncle robbie
thanks freddy krueger
thats not nice
very creative though
go back to the boiler room
i just wish i knew
where she was you know
hes taking it pretty bad
hes acting like a real robot
a zombie or something
hes been wanting to get married
since the third grade
it makes sense
thats when mom and dad died
he wants to start
a family of his own
check out the cake
theres only
a little groom on top
youre late
im sorry
i just couldnt do it
if you need some more time
i guess i can wait
no i dont need
more time robbie
i dont ever want to marry you
you know that information
might have been a little
more useful to me yesterday
ive been talking to my friends
the last couple of days
here it comes
and i think i figured out
whats been bothering me
im not in love with robbie now
im in love with robbie
six years ago
robbie the lead singer
of final warning
when i used to come and
watch you from the front row
in your spandex pants
your silk shirt unbuttoned
licking the microphone
like david lee roth
i still got the spandex
ill put them on right now
the point is
i woke up this morning
and i realized im about
to marry a wedding singer
i am never going
to leave ridgefield
why do you need
to leave ridgefield
we grew up here
all our friends are here
its the perfect place
to raise a family
living in your sisters
basement with five kids
while youre off every
weekend doing wedding gigs
at a whopping 60 bucks a pop
once again
things that could have been
brought to my attention
yesterday
the fact is
we grew apart a long time ago
you wanted to get married
you didnt care to who
thats not true i love you
come here
i want to spend
the rest of my life with you
hey linda
youre a bitch
thanks petey
go back to the house
he might have
tourettes syndrome
were looking into it
i got to go
im sorry
ninetynine luftballons
glenn

these are for you
thank you
theyre beautiful
i have something else for you
two airplane tickets
to las vegas
oh my god glenn
i know you wanted
to set a date
so i went to the travel agent
and set it

but las vegas i thought
jules its the romance
capital of the world
i just dont want
a big wedding
hundreds of people
we dont know
that are just there
for the free drinks
and allyoucaneat buffet
they might as well be in vegas
las vegas it is
and itll be great

its more important
to you anyway
i promise i will give you
the most beautiful wedding
and even youll have
a good time
its about time
his best friend showed up
so hows he doing
i dont know
hes been down in the basement
since it happened
five days now
i think hes having some kind
of a mental situation
an episode or something
all right
you do something because
i dont want to be known
as the brotherinlaw
of the town nut job
i got enough problems already
shit
i got water all over myself
hello
you all right
these sheets are soft
you use downy
all tempacheer
you can wash your clothes
at any temperature
and the colors
dont run together

yeah now leave me alone
you have to go back to work
theres going to be over
a hundred drunk girls
at this wedding tonight
ive got nothing
to offer anybody
i havent done jack shit
since high school
why would any girl
ever marry me
marry you
im just trying to get someone
to play with your dingdong
holiday

took some time to celebrate
come on lets celebrate
just one day out of life
it would be
it would be so nice

why would he even think
about coming back to work

cindy showed up
so right away scott
you got to be pretty psyched
im not paying you to hear
your thoughts on life
im paying you to sing

to every damn word
i have to say
its funny some of us
will never find true love
like take for instanceme
and im pretty sure
that guy right there
and that lady
with the sideburns
and basically
everybody at table nine
but the worst thing is
that me fatty
sideburns lady
and the mutants
over at table nine
will never ever find a way
to better the situation
because
apparently we have
absolutely nothing to offer
the opposite sex
you are the worst wedding singer
in the world buddy
sir one more outburst
i will strangle you
with my microphone wire
lets cut the stupid cake
because the fat guys
going to have a heart attack
if we dont eat again soon
and while we do that
heres a little mood music
cindy and scott are newlyweds
he loves her
but she loves
this guy right here
and he loves somebody else
you just cant win
and so it goes
until the day you die
this thing they call love
is gonna make you cry
i hate you
ive had the blues
the reds and the pinks
one things for sure
love stinks
love stinks
drug addict degenerate

to be a little shaky
a little shaky
i hate weddings
i hate the bride
i hate the groom

ive been thinking
about what happened to you
and its all for the best
i know you were
in love and everything
but that wears off
me and your sister
we used to be wild
she was very adventurous
and we got into some crazy shit
but now the thrill is gone
if we get a second alone
we usually go to sleep
if its a special occasion
she might do
this exotic dance for me
what
sometimes she might
work with my nipples a bit
all right enough go out
ill take care of the kids
i dont know what i just said
but i said something
women got a thing
about marriage
if you want to stay with them
youre gonna have to marry them
no big deal there she is
the girl who finally beat me
into submission

you told me she was in trouble
she was gonna get it
and she didnt even know it
hes teasing
i would never say that
you said you were
gonna give it to her

you didnt know she was engaged
so now youre not
gonna give it to me
very funny
say hi to your brother tito

how are you and glenn doing
with the wedding plans
glenn isnt really
hes very busy right now
he works on wall street
you know how that is nowadays
wall streetstocks and stuff
actually hes in bonds
he barely has time to sleep
let alone plan a wedding
so im kind of doing this
on my own

marshalls
you should go to tonys
theyre cheaper and
theyve got a great selection

well get to hang out
theres other things to do

thats all
to the new lord of the ladies
youre a lovely dancer
are you gonna tell glenn
about what
about you and that kid
and him squeezing your tush
he did have very strong
hands for a 13yearold
i could see that
by the way thank you for
recommending tony the florist
his flowers were beautiful
and he didnt overcharge me
good im glad
and a new girl in town
could certainly use that kind
of help on everything
you got holly
and your mother right
my mother lives 50 miles away
and hollys
not into that kind of thing
so that really only leaves
one person
i would but you know
i justl cant
i understand
i just dont know
how to go about this
im afraid im gonna pay 500
for a halfeaten wedding cake
i really gotta concentrate
on getting some more gigs
theres only four jewish
families in this town
all right
i have never done it
for that cheap
i know for a fact you gave
eric lamensoft that price
i did not
faye look at me
look me in the eyes
im right here
dont look away did you
give him that price or not
ok just that one time
so you got me
can i say something
i deal with a lot of people
but you two look truly happy
youre gonna make it
i know believe me
how do you know
you can just look at a couple
and you can tell right away
theyre gonna
stay together forever
like donald and ivana
and woody and mia
and burt and loni
were not getting married
thats right actually
were brother and sister
so thats it
i could sense a closeness
the weird thing is
when we were growing up
we didnt get along cause
i used to do this to her
were gonna go now
come here sis
your ass is grass
im telling mom
when we get home
yes its ladies night
and the feelings right
yes its ladies night
oh what a
oh what a night
yes its ladies night
and the feelings right
ive never seen it from
this perspective before
is this what i look like
no youre much better
than him
hes ridiculous
one
romantic lady
single baby
sophisticated mama
come on you disco lady
send me a line mama
yes its ladies night
oh what a night
chaka khan
thank you
this is jimmy moore
saying that aint
no sock in my crotch
take four everybody
jimmy that was really good
thank you
no thank you
for what
for quitting
orshould i thank linda
my business has tripled
youve just inspired
me to hire a dj
so thank you
good luck finding a dj who can
move and shake like this
how did you become
a wedding singer
i think i got into it
to make some money
until my music career took off
and you wanted to be
a rock star
i kind of just wanted
to be a songwriter you know
thats the hardest thing
to write a song
a song that
when people hear it
they go ohh i know
what that guy was feeling
when he wrote that
have you written anything
lately
yeah i guess
will you play it for me
you dont want to hear it
its not good
im sure it is
i wrote half of it
when i was with linda
and i wrote the other half
after we broke up
so its a little uneven
you know
i dont mind
id like to hear it
yeah all right
i just want to warn you
that when i wrote this song
i was listening
to the cure a lot so
here we go
you dont know
how much
i need you
while youre near me
i dont feel blue
and when we kiss
i know you need me too
i cant believe
i found a love
thats so pure and true
but it all was bullshit
it was a goddamn joke
and when
i think of you linda
i hope you fuckin choke
i hope youre glad
with what youve done to me
i lay in bed
all day long
feeling melancholy
you left me here
all alone
tears running constantly
oh somebody kill me please
im on my knees
pretty pretty please
kill me
i want to die
put a bullet in my head
i liked it
hes losing his mind
and im reaping
all the benefits
thank you for the ice cream
it always cheers me up
its my pleasure
i feel weird
being in this place
we came here all the time
we used to get chocolate shakes
may i ask what happened
with linda
she wasnt the right one
i guess
did you have any idea
she wasnt the right one
when you were together
i should have
i remember we went
to the grand canyon once
we were flying there
and id never been before
and linda had
so you would think
that she would give me
the window seat
but she didnt
not that thats a big deal
you know
but there were a lot of
little things like that
l know that sounds stupid
not at all
i think its
the little things that count
how did you know
that glenn was the right one
the right one
i always just envisioned
the right one
being someone i could
see myself growing old with
and glenn will be a really
goodlooking older man
like blake carrington
im gonna probably
look like buddy hackett
of course
im gonna hire him
hes your best friend and
the only limo driver in town
yeah i just like
having fun with him
wow look at him go
better move it man
youre not gonna make it
you hit 2 cones
those could have been people
those could have been
guests at her wedding
they were cones
that was fun today
wasnt that fun
that was fun
l got the job right
yeah you did
its august 5th
a week from today
someone left a jacket
in the back
thats julias jacket
remember
she took it off on noxon street
she said its not
jacket weather anymore
uhoh
what
you like her
no i dont
of course you do shes
a cool chick with a hot ass
you talk about her ass again
ill break your neck
anyway she told me
she likes you
really
she said that
think about it
its gonna be your first
kiss as a married couple
its perfectly acceptable
to open your mouth
i just would not want
to do that in a church
in front of god
and all of our relatives
it would gross them out
to see me like
no one will ever solve that
you forgot
your jacket in the limo
thank you for bringing it back
thats so nice of you
yeah it was
ill see you later all right
have fun today
hey wait a second
maybehe can help us
youre the expert on this
we were just having a debate
about wedding kisses
i say that its ok for it
to be an openmouth kiss
and i say that its
