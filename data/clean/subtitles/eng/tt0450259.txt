g8 conference on diamonds
antwerp  belgium
   the locals die
in great number and in misery 
now  this was true of ivory 
rubber  gold and oil 
it is now true of diamonds 
according to a devastating report
by global witness   
    these stones are being used
to purchase arms and finance civil war 
we must act to prohibit   
   the direct or indirect import of all
rough diamonds from conflict zones 
may i remind you   
   that the u s  is responsible   
   for two thirds of
all diamond purchases worldwide   
    and i don  t anticipate
that demand diminishing 
we must remember
that these stones   
    comprise only a small percentage
of the legitimate diamond industry   
   whose trade is crucial to the
economies of many emerging nations 
the freetown government
and their white masters   
   have raped your land
to feed their greed 
ruf have freed you 
  no more slave and master here 
  it s true 
current estimates
are that conflict stones   
   account for only 15 percent
of the market 
but in a multi billion dollar a year
industry   
   that means hundreds of millions
of dollars are available   
   for weapons in these conflict zones 
ruf is fighting for the people 
ruf is fighting for sierra leone 
any bastard think he would joke
with me diamond  i go cut he throat 
stop 
and we are joined today
by members of that diamond industry   
   who wholeheartedly

  danny archer 
  maddy bowen 
  pleased to meet you 
  nice to meet you 
  american  huh 
  guilty 
well  americans usually are 
says the white south african 
i m from rhodesia 
we say zimbabwe now 
don t we 
  do we 
  last time i checked 
don t tell me 
you re here to make a difference 
  and you re here to make a buck 
  i m here for lack of a better idea 
  that s a shame 
  not really 
peace corps types only
stay around long enough   
   to realize they re not helping anyone 
government only wants
to stay in power   
   until they ve stolen enough
to go into exile somewhere else 
and the rebels  they re not sure
they want to take over 
otherwise 
they d have to govern this mess 
  but tia  right  m ed 
  tia 
what s tia 
   this is africa   huh 
  right 
  you want another 
  sure 
so which one are you 
  smuggler 
  am i 
somehow you don t strike me
as the unicef type 
how about soldier of fortune 
or is that too much of a cliché 
diamonds 
  lf i told you i was a missionary    
  for van de kaap 
better watch that type of talk 
miss bowen 
in america  it s bling bling 
but out here  it s bling bang  huh 
i wouldn t want you
getting in any trouble 
how much trouble
do you think i would get into   
   for talking about blood diamonds 
  you re a journalist 
  that s right 
piss off  huh 
for five years  this country has reported
almost no diamond exports   
   while liberia  right next door 
has exported 2 billion dollars  worth 
very odd  considering that liberia
has no diamonds to speak of 
i m shocked 
van de kaap denies trading blood
diamonds  but admits it s impossible   
   to tell where a diamond comes from
unless their smuggler gets caught 
what do you want from me  huh 
you know all about van de kaap 
help me out  off the record 
well  off the record  i like to get kissed

no  solo 
do you want your wife and child
to watch you die 
solo  solo 
they said they re concerned that
some of the refugees might be rebels   
   so they refused to release them
until there s a cease fire 
i m so sorry  solomon 
what you want  mr  archer 
is beyond those hills   
   where i buried it 
you say the mine is on the sewa river 
where exactly 
solomon 
i do not need a map 
yeah  well  i do 
look  we are down here  huh 
the press convoy
is on its way to kono 
you say the diamond mine is up here 
where did you bury it 
when we get to kono 
we re gonna have to walk  all right 
you damn well better be able to find it 
my son is a very good student 
he walks five kilometers
to the sister school   
   every morning to study english 
he s going to be a doctor one day 
 in the 90 degree heat 
solomon vandy drops to his knees   
   rattling the wire
with his powerful hands  
  what 
  nothing 
do you think i m exploiting his grief 
you re right  it s shit 
it s like one of those infomercials 
you know  the little black babies with
swollen bellies and flies in their eyes 
so here i ve got dead mothers  i ve
got severed limbs  but it s nothing new 
it might be enough
to make people cry if they read it   
   maybe even write a check   
   but it s not gonna be enough
to make it stop 
i am sick of writing about victims 
but it s all i can fucking do 
because i need facts 
i need names  i need dates 
i need pictures  i need bank accounts 
people back home
wouldn t buy a ring   
   if they knew it cost
someone else their hand 
but i can t write that story   
   until i get facts
that can be verified   
   which is to say  until i find someone
who will go on record 
so if that is not you   
   and you re not really gonna help me 
and we re not really gonna screw   
   then why don t you get the fuck
out of my face   
   and let me do my work 
do you know that solomon thinks
his son s gonna be a doctor one day 
maybe his baby dies in that camp 
maybe his daughter gets raped 
who knows  maybe both 
do you realize that
that diamond   
   is the only chance he has
of getting his family out 
you don t give a rat s ass   
  do you understand that 
   about his family 
listen  i need to get to kono  all right 
the only way
is with the press convoy 
i m a journalist 
and he s my cameraman  all right 
  no 
  please  maddy 
  please 
  no 
after i smuggle the stones
across the border   
   iocal buyers get them
to a middleman in monrovia 
go on 
he pays off customs and then certifies
that the diamonds were mined in liberia 
that way  they can be legally exported 
now  once they ve reached
the buyers in antwerp   
    diamonds are brought
to the sorting tables   
    no more questions are asked 
by the time they get to india   
    the dirty stones are mixed with the
clean stones from all over the world   
   and then they become
like any other diamonds 
and van de kaap
knows about all this 
yeah 
when i get to london 
i meet with simmons 
supply and demand  you control the
supply  and you keep the demand high 
  agreed 
  good 
now  there s an underground vault   
    where they put all the stones
they buy up to keep off the market   
    so they can keep the price high 
if rebels wanna flood the market
with a billion dollars  worth of rough   
   a company like van de kaap 
who says that they re rare   
   can t afford to let that happen 
especially when they re telling
some poor sod   
    he s supposed to shell out
three months   salary   
    for an engagement ring 
now  technically speaking 
they re not financing the war   
   but creating a situation
where it pays to keep it going 
  you understand 
  yes  and where s my proof 
names  dates and numbered accounts 
you publish one word of this story
before i give them the stone   
   and i m dead  huh 
after i give it to them 
then    i leave this continent forever 
if you don t come out
with the diamond 
then write whatever you want 
i m already dead 
now  remember  all you say is 
 i am the cameraman   all right 
listen  i cannot do this 
  why not 
  because i am not a journalist 
  of course you re not 
  well  then how can i say i am 
because you do  because that s how
you get your son back  all right 
now get on the bus  go 
i am the cameraman 
you are writing about
what is happening here 
yes 
so when people in your country read it 
they will come help us  yes 
probably not 
  you heard of a stinger 
  what 
your friend  maddy  she s like a full on 
heat seeking missile  bru 
i mean  i saw her go into afghanistan   
   like about 200 clicks
into taliban land 
when the military said no 
she just took a bus  bru 
came back with 3000 words 
and she still looked so good 
  like hot  you know 
  all right 
calm down to the frantic now  huh 
  what s that 
  what s going on 
looks like it was an rpg 
open the door  let us out 
  let s go  let s go 
  come on  go  go  go 
go  go  move  move  move 
we ve just happened upon
the sight of an ambush   
   fifteen kilometers
from the liberian border   
   near the moa river   
  as you can see behind me   
   just a few minutes ago   
   an ambulance has   
  got movement in the bush 
  check out the head of the road 
  spread out 
  at this site
