my father hid me in the closet 
i could still see 
my mother suffered 
they tortured her
to get my father to talk 
we re going to have to kill her 
he walked by something
he shouldn t have seen 
they covered his face
with the pillow from my bed 
waste them 
it was too small 
so they shot him 
i never thought   
   blood would be so sticky 
sometimes i think
i can never wash it off 
the only thing i understand
anymore is revenge 
i m going in  and i m going
to do it myself 
you ll only get one of them 
that s why i need you 
i don t do this kind of job anymore

there was no damage
left or right of the blast 
the arming device was impacted
inside the c 4  so it was vaporized 
brilliant plan  totally professional

  this guy is good 
  yeah  okay 
he could put a bomb in your crab shell
and you wouldn t even know it 
i ll kill him 
you can t kill anyone
until we know who he is  can you 
i ll find him 
the important thing to find out
is who he works for 
maybe he s with the cia 
maybe he works for the mafia 
but we have to find out who 
overview 
what does eliminating charlie mean
in the overall picture 
  nothing 
  less than nothing 
so this target wasn t territorial 
it was personal 
how the fuck do you know so much 
he s guessing  let me take
a few boys  i ll find this bastard 
wait a minute  give me a second 
i have to make a decision

i don t know 
this has become very public 
i m sure you want a low profile 
yeah  please 
it would be hard for ned
to go unnoticed 
i think there s more involved here
than keeping a low profile 
i d say that i m the one you can trust 
which is the main word here    trust 
to take him out clean 
our bomb boys are the best 
i hope that s true 
they better be fucking magicians

i studied him  i drew him out 
with my voice  with my ads

a big mouth  hotshot asshole like you 
you know what i love about you 
it s not just this   
   poetry 
it s your heart 
it s the heart you bring to your work 
but if you don t set up a meeting with
him before he drops the third target   
   you ll pray for a lifetime
of tomas s attentions   
   his delicate touch 
  i promise 
  don t touch me 
i m sorry

and if this is a trap   
   i promise you  you re gonna die 
but if he s in there   
   make him feel safe and secure 
and i ll be listening   
   on this microphone 
the second i hear his voice   
   we move in 
understand 
now get out of the fucking car 
when this is all over   
   i can see us spending time together 
you know  you wash   
   the stink of tomas and ray off you   
   you might clean up pretty good 
go ahead 
and then you can go in
and get him yourself 
i don t give a shit 
go on 
move 
if she blinks   
   kill her 
bad plan  ned 
that s it  we ve got him  move in 
damn it 
damn it 
go  you chicken shits 
you think he ll top that 
get in there 
watch the river and the side streets 
fucking crabs 
nice one 
watch the river 
you want to set me up again 
what s that 
break it down 
air brakes 
complex sound  slightly muffled 
people talking   
   clamping down steps 
a clapping shut 
voices    mechanical sounds 
  a hiss 
  people getting off a bus 
you must have an overview 
it s people getting off a bus 
are they on both tapes 
i knew it  we gotta have bus routes 
what do we have 
he uses pay phones 
but he gets there by bus 
oh  ray  always so precise 
let s say  he gets on a bus
wherever he lives  and he   
   goes in both directions 
good counter surveillance technique 
he takes the bus 20  25 minutes
in each direction  so we have   
four  four and four 
here we go  triangulation 
three routes  that s it 
we want checks in five minute intervals 
how about the restaurants 
he must eat sometime 
try to remember  he d have got off
the bus alone  maybe bought cigarettes 
look at that face 
we have a lot of regular customers 
but he ain t one 
look at that face again 
come on  come on 
nothing 
hey  henry 
i forgot to tell you  we deliver 
now there s a vision 
good morning  stranger 
i ve got to go 
where  i think we already wore out
our welcome at the hilton 
i want to stay with you 
but it s not over for me 
joe león ordered the hit 
let me get this right 
you think killing joe
will make everything okay 
something has to 
you did the job  i m not asking
for your help  i ll do it  i owe him 
no 
you owe her 
her  a whole life  come here 
come here 
put all this behind you now 
or the past will eat you alive 
i know what i m talking about

wish me luck 
come here  you re not going 
detonation sequence primed 
enter code 
top of the world  mom 
controlled 
one    two    three   
i m afraid to ask 
explosions will occur
if the inner perimeter is breached 
each one of these lights is a pressure
mine  if one goes  they all go 
  where are they 
  everywhere 
don t worry  they re not armed yet 
when these lights turn red    worry 
this is good  nice sneak attack 
do not approach the warehouse 
perimeter is on 
please  cut the bullshit 
that s a good one  i taught him that 
nice sense of irony 
blowing up the bomb disposal unit 
nice work  ray 
warning 
gunfire will automatically
detonate b 20 s   
   sufficient to destroy
two square miles 
give me that 
listen up  anybody shoots   
   anybody shoots  i shoot them 
this whole place is wired and
i m taking him alive 
you got that 
that s new 
how s that feel  ace 
fuck this amateur hour 
you re crazy 
all the highly trained professionals
of the world   
   all the hardware   
   all the technology 
and what have you got 
nothing 
you gotta do everything yourself 
and why 
you can t get good help these days 
a surprise for you  ray 
warning  perimeter breach 
it s set  let s go 
don t move 
  i ll lead you through the mines 
  evacuate 
ray    
i m sorry  should i have knocked 
you lose  i win 
she s hot  ray 
semtex  sprayed with nitro 
cigarette case 
honest injun  take a look 
just a peek  no touch 
you might ask yourself 
 why is today my time to die  
take it out  slowly 
slowly 
open it 
everyone deserves to die 
ask god 
he kills across the board 
so why shouldn t i 
bye 
here s a tip i learned from you 
it s a focused detonation 
only she blows 
  it s pretty nifty  huh 
  don t move it  it s a mercury switch 
any change in angle  it goes 
got it 
anyway  ray  she s dead already 
what i need   
   what i need is to take you alive
because my boss   
   wants to look in your eyes
when you die 
sick fuck 
i m touched  really 
what happened to us  ray 
we were   
   we were good together 
you were the rigger
and i was the trigger 
you shouldn t have taken me down 
because  look at us now  you fuck 
i see you re still into
the old memories  ray 
those memories always do you in  right 
it s that trying to save the innocent 
you know your problem  ray 
you re too sentimental 
there s nothing wrong
with being sentimental 
sometimes it can save your ass 
here s a tip  no fail safe 
pressure pads 
30 seconds to total destruction 
slide it to me 
25 seconds 
it s all right 
just do it  may 
slide your hands out 
20 seconds 
get out of here 
straight down the right side 
not without you 
i m right behind you 
10 seconds 
5 seconds 
come on  come on 
3 seconds 
thank you
