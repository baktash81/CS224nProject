my father hid me in the closet
i could still see
my mother suffered
they tortured her
to get my father to talk
were going to have to kill her
he walked by something
he shouldnt have seen
they covered his face
with the pillow from my bed
waste them
it was too small
so they shot him
i never thought
blood would be so sticky
sometimes i think
i can never wash it off
the only thing i understand
anymore is revenge
im going in and im going
to do it myself
youll only get one of them
thats why i need you
i dont do this kind of job anymore
i know youve been watching me
trying to decide if
lm on the level

he was a thief
tell me about the bomb
very clean
there was no damage
left or right of the blast
the arming device was impacted
inside the c4 so it was vaporized
brilliant plan totally professional

this guy is good
yeah okay
he could put a bomb in your crab shell
and you wouldnt even know it
ill kill him
you cant kill anyone
until we know who he is can you
ill find him
the important thing to find out
is who he works for
maybe hes with the cia
maybe he works for the mafia
but we have to find out who
overview
what does eliminating charlie mean
in the overall picture
nothing
less than nothing
so this target wasnt territorial
it was personal

maybe hes not interested in
a bigmouth hotshot asshole like you
you know what i love about you

but if you dont set up a meeting with
him before he drops the third target

of tomass attentions

wherever he lives and he
goes in both directions
good countersurveillance technique
he takes the bus 20 25 minutes
in each direction so we have
four four and four
here we go triangulation
three routes thats it
we want checks in fiveminute intervals
how about the restaurants
