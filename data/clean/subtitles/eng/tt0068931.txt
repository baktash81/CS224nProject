that you and me and your father
took up to canada

you fell overboard 
you couldn t swim 
your old man says 
 he ll learn pretty fast  
you were floppin  around 
you looked like a drowned rat 
but you didn t say a word 
you didn t yell for help
or nothin  
you just kept lookin 
at your old man   
and he didn t make a move 
well  pretty soon
i had to reach out   
and grab you by the hair
and pull you in the boat 
you looked like a drowned rat 
your old man 
he laughed like hell 
that was a long time ago 
hey  what are you drinkin

i m dependent on you 
kinda ties us together

i wrote you a letter 
i couldn t mail it 
i didn t know where 
i keep moving around 
it s true  you know 
i do always know
when you re near 
esp 
maybe 
what s the matter  baby 
well  i ve been here
about three minutes   
and you ve managed about
one recrimination a minute 
i can t seem to feel anything
but hurt when you re not here 
i guess when i see you again 
i just have to hurt back 
did you really
write me a letter 
 my dearest love   
 i m once again alone  
i can t hear you 
 and the silence in this room   
 presses against my ears
until i m deafened 
 this is the way i live
until i see you again   
 and then you re here
and there s no past 
 only the two of us 
 i know these words hurt you   
 because you can t give
anything but the moment   
 but i have to write them now   
 because somehow my need
for you must find its voice 
 and you   what of your pain 
 if you could only
let me have   
 one small part
of the weight of it  
don t read anymore 
don t you see 
even that would be a comfort
to me when you re not here 
oh  my darling 
i love you so much  i can t   
don t 
it s gonna be all right 
oh  baby  i love you 
oh  my darling 
darling  take us to bed 
baby  i missed you 
i m so glad you re here 
i love you 
it ll be a hundred more
this time 
the letter took me
a while to make up 
all right 
yes  the letter was good 
try to think of something
like it for next time 
ok  i will 
to his community and church   
he gave his resources 
his faith  and his spirit 
his good works comfort us
in the going 
we commit his remains
to your earth  o  father   
and we pray you
vouchsafe him eternal life 
i ve always been interested
in primitive rituals   
like tucking the dead away 
glory be to the father
and to the son   
and to the holy spirit 
glory be to the father 
harry mckenna   
fixer extraordinaire   
pusher  pimp  thief  arsonist

oh  yeah 
he was my kind of man 
what was your connection
with him 
he worked for my father
a long time back 
he thought i could
do him a favor 
so  your old man was in  huh 
and you 
don t you think you should be

oh  no 
i wanted you to watch 
now  let me see
if i ve got everything 
ice cubes  wine  razor blades 
how long does it take 
i don t know 
sure you do 
you know everything 
louise 
you called me because   
either you don t want to do it 
and you want me to stop you   
or you want to lay
the guilt of it on me   
and i m not buying either one 
so go ahead on 
hold on 
mind if i have
a little wine first 
you son of a bitch 
mr  bishop 
not for me  thanks 
you really don t believe 
baby 
i call you baby because
your innocence touches me so 
those really are sharp 
aren t they 
i always said
that you had guts  louise 
about how long will it take 
mr  bishop 
how much do you weigh 
110 
two and a half to three hours 
at first you ll get cold 
and then sleepy 
you re a son of a bitch  too 
louise  i haven t had
anything to eat yet today 
what you got in the fridge 
thanks 
i know he ll stop me 
i know he will 
i know he feels something 
i know you 
what 
i didn t hear you  baby 
what d you say 
i said you ll stop it 
listen 
if you don t care anything   
about your own life 
then why should i 
you do care  you do 
and you do  too 
i m cold 
i m getting colder 
i m cold 
psychosomatic 
you ve got an hour
and a half left 
please  steve 
i don t want to do it 
if you kick it   
you can probably make
the sheriff s station   
in malibu
in about fifteen minutes 
would you have let it happen 
would you 
look  i was just an observer 
you haven t answered
my question 
well  what do you think 
we ll never know  will we 
well  say
that i just sat there   
or we just sat there
and watched her check out 
think that
would have been crazy 
irrational  maybe 
is there anything wrong
with that 
it just means that you
have your own rule book 
i can dig that 
is that so 
it takes a very special
kind of person   
to pick up the tab
for that kind of living 
you say you dig it 
but you re talkin  about   
something you really
know nothing about 
and you do 
do i 
very slippery 
when he s cornered  he answers
questions with questions 
what s your action  mr  bishop 
you ve been watching
too many late movies 
well  it s been interesting 
thanks  maybe another time 
the underwater feeding show   
by marineland s staff diver
in the giant fish tank 
the giant fish tank
is to your left   
next of kin 
none 
anybody we can notify 
how about an acquaintance 
are you finished  doctor 
no  there s a charge 
you can take care of it at the
cashier s window one floor up 
i suggest that you make
an appointment with your doctor 
that is  if you have a doctor 
what do you think 
what d you feel
before you passed out 
couldn t get my breath 
palms sweating 
nausea  heart beating fast 
sounds like an a r 
acute anxiety reaction 
classic neurasthenic pattern 
see a doctor  mr  bishop 
have some tests 
if they come back negative   
maybe you should think
about seeing a psychiatrist 
in the meantime  take these 
they ll help a little 
i need a signature  doc 
hey  you were really
out there for a while 
the cashier  you say 
is on the first floor 
dr  richmond
wanted in emergency 
watch your backs  please 
thank you 
you waitin  for me 
how long you been here 
since last night  about 12 00 
must be important 
you said another time 
i said maybe another time 
that s right 
that s what you said 
come on in 
so this is what it looks like
inside your head  huh 
this place must ve cost
some bread 
are you still trying
to figure my action 
i inherited enough 
it is nice to be comfortable 
isn t it 
is there something specific
you want to talk about 
no  i just   
well  yeah  there is 
what happened the other night 
that was pretty far out   
and you were saying
some things about it 
so 
so  how  bout some answers 
to what 
for openers 
suppose i say i think   
i m the kind of person   
that can pick up the tab
for what happened 
what s the rest of it 
what makes you think
i can answer that 
you said that  
i said that you didn t know
anything about it 
it doesn t mean i do 
now you see him  now you don t 
is my time up 
there is something
i have to do 
can i come 
what do you want from me 
that s incredible 
yeah  it keeps me sharp 
balance 
problems of orientation  
sometimes you have
to think in reverse 
here  you take it 
that s not bad 
how long you been flying 
about twenty seconds 
my father
was what they called a judge 
he would settle arguments
on the council   
and his word was final 
it was never questioned   
until one day
some hothead from chicago   
took exception
to one of his decisions   
and put a contract on him 
the guy that got him
was a shooter from topeka 
that was all 
how old were you then 
your age 
maybe younger 
i was still in school 
you find this interesting 
don t you 
are you kidding 
my father used to do
front numbers even for me 
like if he did that 
maybe it wouldn t rub off 
never talk about that stuff 
he was beautiful 
only trouble was 
i really wanted to dig it 
he wanted me to be
a part of his front  too 
so  what happened
after they burned your old man 
i finished school 
and 
that s all  then i grew up 
did your father ever tell you
anything about the operation   
like how it worked 
what s with those guys  anyway 
they all act
like they re ashamed 
my father wasn t ashamed 
he was the best 
game 
you re pretty good 
 play to win  do you 
 you know any other way 
let s make it two out of three 
ok  but i m telling you 
i m genius at this game 
yeah 
you go get the ball  genius 
what s going on 
that old man is yamoto 
he s here from japan 
where he s a master 
the other guy is kori 
very dangerous and very fast   
but he s got some new tricks   
that are sort of an insult
to the old style 
yamoto thinks these tricks   
are useless
against a classic fighter   
and he s here
to prove his point 
the object of these fights is
total concentration and control 
they don t actually
hit each other   
otherwise one or the other
would be dead   
and that s against the law 
i thought he wasn t
supposed to hit him 
probably
one of kori s new tricks 
you haven t said three words
since the match 
he practically
murdered that guy 
murder is only killing
without a license   
and everybody kills 
governments 
the military  the police 
do you think
that yamoto s a killer 
he s a killer who doesn t kill 
it s funny 
for him 
the rules are important 
that s your expert opinion 
that s my opinion 
ok  don t get uptight 
 not me 
 bullshit 
look  every time we re on this
subject  the same thing happens 
as long as we re rapping it out
on your terms   
everything s ok  but the minute
i have a question   
or i want to know
something specific from you   
you either shine me on
or go out for coffee 
what the hell is going on 
you re pressing pretty hard 
you d better be damn sure
you want to know 
this is not
freshman philosophy time 
i m sure 
you ever hear
the term  mechanic    
used outside
of its normal meaning 
where 
my father used it 
it s a dealer 
a guy who works game tables 
anything else 
sure  it s a shooter 
a hit man 
so 
so there we are 
and that s your action 
yeah  that figures 
i m telling you this   
because there are times
when i could use a backup 
wouldn t have
to spread myself so thin 
and you seem
to have the aptitude 
you do this for money 
money is paid 
but that s not the motive 
it has to do with standing
outside of it all on your own 
i m gonna teach you all i can 
after that  you can choose
how you want it to go 
 you in 
 do i have an alternative 
there are alternatives
to everything 
you ve got a partner 
mr  bishop 
associate 
point the gun as though it were
an extension of your arm   
and keep both eyes open 
all right  you ready  pull 
that s better  much better 
pull 
winchester 
300 magnum  180 grains 
muzzle velocity 
pull 
3 070 
drop at 200 yards 
two minutes low  pull 
300 yards 
pull 
5 3 inches 
300 yards  150 grains 
4 8 inches 
pull 
doubles 
pull 
there are killers 
and there are killers 
to tell you the truth   
they all have
a different book of rules 
to get away with it
depends on the book of rules   
you have in your pocket
at the time 
your own country 
somebody else s country   
or your own personal
book of rules 
all this  heroes 
half of them were killers 
napoléon was one  you know 
pancho villa  genghis khan 
and then we have
our own domestic brand   
like billy the kid  jesse james 
and john dillinger 
yeah  they re about as famous   
as our own
honest to goodness heroes 
don t tell me
that s gonna make us heroes 
i wouldn t tell you
anything like that 
all i m saying is that people
who stand outside the law   
oftentimes end up as heroes 
what s with that ball of wax
i see you squeezing 
sometimes you have
to hold the mark 
it develops the strength 
 in the ages
between 45 and 64   
 of the total deaths
by accident   
 10 431 were from falls  
you know  falls from
high places are very clean 
what s that 
that is your first involvement 
taking the zoo drive turnoff 
now they re going west 
there s one camera 
another 
two cameras
covering the main gate 
you couldn t
get within 100 yards   
without tripping
that alarm system 
the guards sleep in shifts 
one of them awake all the time 
what about number one 
midnight till 4 00
in the morning 
we need more 
we ll have to stay in closer
until we find something 
i want you to rent two cars 
a ford and a volkswagen 
this looks like
it might be something 
turn this on 
comes across the border
at 1 a m 
i can have it to you

how 
in a chicken lickin  truck
right to your place 
ok  you check the goods
when it comes  then wake me 
i ll make the test 
better not be crap 
you know where to find me 
well  they ll have
to turn off the alarm system   
to make that delivery 
where d you learn
how to do that 
one of the tools of the trade 
my friend 
allied plating  this is frank 
listen  i ve got a bumper
that needs re chroming 
if i brought it in tomorrow 
can i pick it up by saturday 
we don t work
on saturday down here 
monday afternoon the soonest 
monday s all right 
i ll bring it in tonight 
since there s no guard
on the weekends   
at the allied plating plant   
we could put the bodies
in these nitric acid tanks 
mr  bishop 
we would like you
to go ahead with this one 
we go 
i m gonna check you for iron
before you go past here 
 come on  get out 
 what s the matter 
come on  get out of there 
what the hell is this 
chicken lickin  
chicken lickin 
is lickin  chicken 
wise guy 
get the bodies in the truck 
do you know my dog
got a birthday card today 
i didn t  just my dog 
archibald  those kids
on the hill there  
how can you live here
with all that noise 
i called the police 
but there s nothing they can do 
daddy  it s getting worse here
every weekend 
in forty eight hours   
everything will be in solution 
it was   
what 
well  it could ve been
so simple   
but that guy
came out of nowhere 
those things happen   
but remember it the next time 
could you spare a few minutes 
mr  bishop 
yes  when 
now  i m at home 
all right 
i have to do something
for a while 
i ll see you later 
mr  bishop is here  sir 
show him through 
this way  sir 
that was very untidy 
mr  bishop 
we d like to know how
harry mckenna s son figures 
he ll be working with me
from now on 
you think this is wise 
you telling me
i need your permission 
information is all i want 
mr  bishop 
we like to know things 
an organization survives
only because its members   
are willing to sacrifice
certain personal choices   
for the good of all 
a very democratic principle 
mr  bishop 
we survive
because we have this rule 
what you or i want
is unimportant 
only the rule 
someone trained by me
could be of value to you 
nobody lives forever 
you take
full responsibility then 
this one has to be done fast 
very fast 
i ll handle it
the way i always do 
there may not be
time enough for that 
the word is  he s getting ready
to talk to some people 
the problem is considerable 
i m not some wild
cleveland shooter 
i don t cowboy 
if he talks  things
could get complicated   sloppy 
that would disturb a lot of us 
it s not really open
to discussion  mr  bishop 
this business
of mckenna s son   
has upset
a few of our associates 
i understand it   
but these people
see it only from the outside 
a quick  clean job
would go a long way   
in putting everything
back into proper balance 
yes  i understand 
i knew you would 
your man s in naples 
we ve given you
a name in rome   
for any equipment
you might need 
good  you re still up 
i called you about 9 00 
yeah  well 
louise picked me up and we   
it s good for the nerves 
she has this thing she does  
spare me the details 
look  if i d known
you wanted to work  
you are a free agent  my friend 
the only thing you have to do   
is fulfill the requirements
of the association 
and that means
your occasional presence   
some intelligent responses 
some skill at your work   
and nothing more 
you ve got that 
so what s buggin  you 
we got one  huh 
they want him to be cowboyed 
explain 
they want me to get him now   
any way i can 
that doesn t sound very cool 
what are you gonna do
about that 
i m too far along
to change my habits 
i ll do what i ve always done   
in italy 
italy  am i gonna go 
why not

casa de fiori doesn t travel 
it s not bad

the time you take
is very important 
savor it 
even what we re doing now 
see  you must
figure it carefully 
don t rush 
know every move  turn it
over and over in your mind   
until you re sure
there are no holes 
but you have to be
dead sure   or dead 
no second chances 
i ll try and remember that 
remember  don t try 
dead sure   or dead 
the room s not going

i think i ll take a walk

that ought to take care of  em 
one of  em had a walkie talkie 
he was in contact with somebody 
there they are 
it s a road block 
slow down 
when you re about
200 feet from them

this stuff is absolutely clear
when it s in solution 
i just coated the inside
of the glass with it   
and let it dry 
and when the wine hit it   
it went right back
into solution  no trace 
looks just like a heart attack 
you said every man
