in lower depths  quote 
 miserable being must find
more miserable being 
then he s happy  
  unquote 
  boris is a philosopher 
besides  little bublichki 
wearing license here 
that is like waving 
you should excuse the expression 
red flag in front of bull 
my license 
but what s wrong with it 
there ain t nothin  wrong with it 
confidential 
there s not one dog here
who would not give left hind leg
for such a knick knack 
that s your passport to freedom  honey
without it   
hey  hey  yous guys  look 
poor nutsy is takin  the long walk 
where is he taking him 
through the one way door  sister

yeah  that s what
the tramp always says 
  the tramp 
  now there s a bloke
what never gets caught 
he s given the slip to every
dogcatcher in this burg 
you won t believe this  dearie 
but no matter how tight a jam he s in 
that tramp always finds some way out 
i can quite easily believe that 
but remember  my friends 
even tramp has his achilles  heel 
pardon me  amigo

what a dog 
peg used to be
in the dog and pony follies 
he s a tramp
but they love him
breaks a new heart every day
he s a tramp
they adore him
and i only hope he ll stay that way
he s a tramp
he s a scoundrel
he s a rounder
he s a cad
he s a tramp
but i love him
yes  even i have got it pretty bad
you can never tell
when he ll show up
he gives you plenty of trouble
i guess he s just a no  count pup
but i wish that he were double
he s a tramp
he s a rover
and there s nothin  more to say
if he s a tramp
he s a good one
and i wish that i could travel his way
wish that i could travel his way
yeah 
but he never takes them serious 
but someday he is meeting
someone different 
some delicate  fragile creature
who s giving him a wish
to shelter and protect 
like miss park avenue here  matey 
could be 
  but when he does   
  yeah  i m way ahead of ya 
under the spell of true love   
the poor chump grows careless   
the cossacks are picking him up   
and it s curtains for the tramp 
it s the little cooker  bill 
  in number four 
  ok
