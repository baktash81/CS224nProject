its good to see
you too bud
so what happened
i fought back
tried to anyway
youre lucky
you found us at all
they had us
on the move a lot
it felt like something
big was happening
any idea where
they were heading
all i know is
they kept talking
about a city
i didnt think
there were any cities left
thats because
there arent
not still standing anyway
okay wait what about minho
why wasnt he on the train
im sorry thomas
he was
they got 40
maybe 50 kids
were still compiling
an official count
but the pilot
got a good look
he thinks it was them
of course it was them
what about the berg
we tracked it a few miles
but someone must have
known about the locator
theyre totally off the grid
move it immunes
c22
b9
were searching the area
but theyre probably
long gone by now
oh no theyre not
going anywhere
he didnt get
what he really wanted
there thats it
its a few hundred miles
based on the railways
everything that aris
told us
thats gotta be
where theyre headed
thats where
theyre taking minho
we take everyone
who can fight
follow the roads
where we can
we can make it back
within a week
a week
it took us six months
to get here
we got over
100 kids here now
we cant just hang out
here forever
after what we
just pulled
you wanna wander off
to some random point
on the map
you dont even know
whats there
i do
its been a few years
but ive been there
the last city
thats what wicked called it
it was their whole
base of operations
if that city
is still standing
thats the last place
you wanna go hermano
thats the lions den
its nothing we havent
done before
yeah with months
of planning
and reliable information
the element of surprise
none of which we have now
vince ive
thought this through
would you just
hear me out
the last time we
went off halfcocked
i lost everything
you remember that
look i know
its minho all right
but you cant ask me

on the line for one man

you guys almost lasted

you good
yeah
im sorry i didnt wanna
bring you guys into this
i think what
hes trying to say
is thanks for saving us
youre welcome
hey
dont get your hopes up
that checkpoint back there
that was the citys
last defense
if that was overrun
chances are the city is too
yeah unless they figured out
some other way
to keep the cranks out
funny
spent three years
trapped behind walls
trying to break out
and now we wanna
break back in
yeah its hilarious
jorge how do we get in
dont look at me hermano
those walls are new
i guess thats wickeds
answer for everything
well we aint gonna
figure it out from up here
lets go
you really think
hes in there
i guess well find out
you know shes
gonna be there too
we just have to make sure
we have the resources
and ill keep in touch
excuse me
are you ready
itll be fine
people are beginning
to lose faith doctor
when you sealed off the walls
you assured us
that it would only be
a temporary precaution
why have you now
denied all entry
because things are changing
and not for the better
infection rates were up 300
fortunately
we may be on the verge
of a breakthrough
this is subject a7
he spent over three years
in the maze trials
the antibodies
produced in response
have been the strongest
weve ever seen
were extracting
a new serum as we speak
and with your support
wed like to begin
human trials
thank you doctor
that is very impressive
but we have been
down this road before
frankly we are all beginning
to wonder if
if our resources couldnt be
better spent elsewhere
meaning
safe zones
protected areas
like the one were in
we could save
as many people as possible
how many
a thousand
two thousand
and thats assuming
your protected areas
stay protected
which we know they wont
the infected already outnumber
the healthy threetoone
all youd be doing
is delaying the inevitable
have any of you ever lost
someone to the virus
a niece
anna
im sorry we werent
able to help her
but imagine if we were able
to live with the virus
to survive it
imagine being able
to tell anna
that you could give her the
chance to live a normal life
weve never been
this close to a cure
and weve sacrificed a lot
to get this far
please
dont let those sacrifices
be for nothing
nicely done
they can be a tough crowd
you handled them perfectly
delaying the inevitable
thomas used to say
the same about us
do you still think about him
i can help you with that
those memories
theres no reason
to keep holding on to them
its a simple procedure
there is a reason
i want to remember
if we find a cure
thats the only way all this
was worth it
i hope youre right
this place has really
gone through hell
we just gotta stay together
we are the voice
of the voiceless
they hide
behind their walls
thinking they can keep
the cure for themselves
while they watch the rest
of us wither and rot
but there are more of us
than there are of them
and i say
we rise up
and take back what is ours
lets bring back a victory
get janson
let us in
thats it thats our way in
let us in
to the wall
let us in
let us in let us in
thomas
this is not
what youre looking for
all these people
trying to find their way in
you think youre gonna
find something they cant
came this far
im not turning back now
what the hell
did we get ourselves into
get out of my way
get out of my way
thomas this
doesnt feel right
you were right sir
the drone sweep picked him up
outside the walls
get the guns online
hey guys we gotta go now

that he was stung
and half out of his mind
just calm down all right
come on
kind of had that coming
anybody else fry newt
do you know this guy
he was an old friend
how
how is this possible
we watched you die
no you left me to die
and if we hadnt found you
when we did
youd be dead right now
what the hell
are you doing here
minho
wicked has him here
were looking for a way in
i can help with that
follow me
im not going
anywhere with you
suit yourself
but i can get you
through those walls
after the maze
i got picked up by a group
headed to the city
they realized i was immune
patched me up
and they brought me here
to lawrence
this groups been at war
with wicked
ever since they took control
of the city
but wicked cant hide behind
those walls forever
days gonna come
and theyre gonna pay
for what theyve done
listen uh
he doesnt get
a lot of visitors
so let me do the talking
all right
and try not to stare
rose took my nose
i suppose
rose took my nose i suppose
suppose suppose
took my nose
i suppose
gally
glad to see you made it back
jasper told me what happened
it was a slaughter
theres nothing we could do
against those guns
no
but they can only poke
the hornets nest so long
before they get stung
now who are these people
why are they here
we need to get into wicked
gally said you can get us
through the walls
gally should know better
than to make promises
that he cant keep
besides that wall
is only half your problem
getting inside wicked
is impossible
there might be a way now
but it doesnt work
without thomas
is that so
do you know what i am
thomas
i am a businessman
which means that i dont
take unnecessary risks
why should i trust you
cause i can help you
you see if you can get me
through those walls
i can get you what you need
what is it
that you think i need
time
every last drop
is that what i need
wicked has something
we both want
ill tell you what
two can go for now
the rest stay down here
with me
just a little insurance
to make sure
you find your way back
we have a deal
gally show him the way
be careful thomas
gally take care of these two
yeah
this is gross
jesus
yeah this is great
stay with me
we got a ways to go
were ready
shai
hi miss teresa
hi
hey
how are you feeling
okay
is that gonna make me better
i hope so
do you remember the story
you were telling me
about the house
you grew up in
i dont remember
the one by the lake
it burns
i know i know
there we go all done
youre so brave
oh
that is incredible
how soon can you administer
to the infected
you show a lot of compassion
for someone who just
opened fire on a crowd
you told me to do my job
i had a shot i took it
and missed apparently
the patrols
never found a body
thomas is still out there
what about her
does she know
no
she cant
i need her to stay focused
elevate security levels
throughout the city
im counting on you
to handle this janson
red zone
departing the station
in five minutes
thank you
this is a long way
from the glade
fifteen
minutes to mandatory curfew
please proceed home
in an orderly fashion
remember
this is for your safety
thank you for your compliance
yeah we better
get off these streets
and i know its hard but act
like youve seen it before
theyve definitely
upped security
im guessing you shanks have
something to do with that
all right
lets get outta here
all right newt youre up
i got it
there it is
if wickeds got minho
thats where
theyll be keeping him
lawrence has been trying
to find a way in for years
place is crawling
with soldiers
they got
surveillance everywhere
scanners on every floor
sounds like a bloody fortress
yeah i thought you said
you had a way in
i might
you might
what the hell
do you mean might
take a look
i said i had a way in
i didnt say
you were gonna like it
no theres gotta be
another way
like what
youve seen the building
she is our only way in
you really think
shes gonna help us
i dont plan on
asking for her permission
am i missing something here
this is the same girl
who betrayed us correct
same dick
i like her
whats going on
what are you afraid
your little girlfriends
gonna get hurt
hmm
because this has
obviously never been
just about rescuing minho
has it
wait what are you
talking about
teresa
shes the only reason
that minhos even missing
in the first place
now we finally have an
opportunity to get him back
and what you dont want to
because of her
because deep down inside
you still care about her
dont you
just admit it
newt i
dont lie to me
dont lie to me
sorry
im sorry
sorry about that back there
i guess i cant
hide this anymore
why didnt you tell me
didnt think it would
make any difference
all i know is that wicked
must have put me
in that maze for a reason
maybe it was literally
just so they could tell
the difference
between immunes like you
and people like me
you know we can
still fix this newt
okay we can
dont worry about me
this is about minho
now he needs us
so if there is even
the slightest chance
that we can save him
we can get him out of there
then we have to take that
no matter what the cost
okay i hear you
lets get him up
minho
can you hear me
theres a little girl here
her name is shai lun
shes been infected
for three weeks now
but minho
youre going to save her
and you can save
so many others
everything were doing here
its working
do you understand
thats why
this is so important
i just wanted you to know
teresa
minho
minho
youre a traitor
we trusted you
get off
hey let her go
get off me get off me
ill kill you you traitor
you killed them all
teresa they need you
in the med lab
it sounds serious
im sorry teresa
its not your fault
you did everything you could
this is an alert
curfew is now in effect
anyone caught
in violation of curfew
will be subject
to immediate deportation
thomas
thomas
hey teresa
you shouldnt be here
if janson finds out
youre here
im not staying
its just uh
i had to see you
i have to ask you something
do you regret it
what you did to us
sometimes
but i did
what i thought was right
id do it again
good
taking
the edge off i see
beautiful isnt it
yes
its a lovely city
hmm
the walls
its amazing what people
can accomplish
when their survivals
at stake
squeeze them hard enough
theres nothing they cant do
no line they wont cross
youve had a bit of a setback
its nothing
were not used to
not this time
the virus is airborne
its inside the walls
that serum
was our last chance
anyone not already infected
will be inside of a month
okay
we can handle this
we just need to evacuate
essential personnel
set up at another safe zone
farther north
weve still got 28 immunes
right inside this building
we can find more
you would
youd hunt every last
one of them down
till there was no one left
in spite of everything
weve done to them
everything weve put
them through
at least we gave
them the tools
theyll need to survive
maybe theyll succeed
where weve failed
are you really telling me
that youre giving up
after everything
its not about
giving up janson
its about knowing
when youve lost
gally
heres how this is gonna go
were gonna ask you
some questions
and youre gonna tell us
exactly what we need to know
well start off simple
wheres minho
you guys dont
seriously think
dont look at him
why are you looking at him
look at me
hes not gonna help you
now we know you have minho
in the building
where
hes with the others
in holding
sublevel three
how many others
i can make that work
no
no you guys dont understand
the whole levels restricted
you cant get in
without a thumbprint id
thats why youre
gonna come with us
well i dont know
we dont necessarily need her
right
not all of her
we just need her finger
gally back off
what
are you squeamish
i guarantee you shes done
a lot worse to minho
thats not the plan
back off
it wont make
a difference
do whatever you want to me
you still wont get through
the front door
the sensors will
pick you up the
we know were tagged
property of wicked
youre gonna help us
with that too
try to relax
this is gonna sting
lets just get it over with
she enjoyed that
youre probably right
here see if these fit
thanks
thanks newt
better get going
old man
long road ahead of you
you sure i cant
talk you out of this
its your last chance
you know its not like you
to shy away from a fight
and its not like you
to go looking for one

our necks out for strangers

dear thomas
this is the first letter
i can remember writing
obviously i dont know if i
wrote any before the maze
but even if its not my first
its likely to be my last
i want you to know
that im not scared
well not of dying anyway
its more forgetting
its losing myself
to this virus
thats what scares me
so every night ive been
saying their names out loud
alby
winston chuck
and i just repeat them
over and over
like a prayer
and it all comes
flooding back
just the little things
like the way
the sun used to
hit the glade
at that perfect moment
right before
it slipped beneath the walls
and i remember the taste
of frypans stew
i never thought
id miss that stuff so much
and i remember you
i remember the first time you
came up in the box
just a scared little greenie
who couldnt even remember
his own name
but from that moment
you ran into the maze
i knew i would
follow you anywhere
and i have
we all have
if i could do it
all over again i would
and i wouldnt
change a thing
and my hope for you
is that when youre looking
back years from now
youll be able
to say the same
the futures
in your hands now tommy
and i know youll find a way
to do whats right
you always have
take care of everyone for me
and take care of yourself
