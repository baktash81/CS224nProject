our troubles are over

through this yet 
wicked s still out there 
they re not giving up 
 cause you got
something they want 
they took you
because you re immune
to a plague that s
wiping out the human race 
and they think you re worth
sacrificing to find a cure 
well  i don t 
so in two days 
when we get this tub
of rust seaworthy 
we re getting
the hell outta here 
we re gonna go to a place

don t worry 
when i crank out 
you ll be the first
to know  okay 
here  drink this 
took you guys
long enough to rescue us 
it s good to see
you  too  bud 
so what happened 
i fought back 
tried to  anyway 
you re lucky
you found us at all 
they had us
on the move a lot 
it felt like something
big was happening 
any idea where
they were heading 
all i know is
they kept talking
about a city 
i didn t think
there were any cities left 
that s because
there aren t 
not still standing  anyway 
okay  wait  what about minho 
why wasn t he on the train 
i m sorry  thomas 
he was 
they got 40 
maybe 50 kids 
we re still compiling
an official count 
but the pilot
got a good look 
he thinks it was them 
of course it was them 
what about the berg 
we tracked it a few miles 
but someone must have
known about the locator 
they re totally off the grid 
move it  immunes 
c22 
b9 
we re searching the area 
but they re probably
long gone by now 
oh  no  they re not
going anywhere 
he didn t get
what he really wanted 
there  that s it 
it s a few hundred miles 
based on the railways 
everything that aris
told us 
that s gotta be
where they re headed 
that s where
they re taking minho 
we take everyone
who can fight 
follow the roads
where we can 
we can make it back
within a week 
a week 
it took us six months
to get here 
we got over
100 kids here now 
we can t just hang out
here forever
after what we
just pulled 
you wanna wander off
to some random point
on the map 
you don t even know
what s there 
i do 
it s been a few years 
but i ve been there 
the last city 
that s what wicked called it 
it was their whole
base of operations 
if that city
is still standing 
that s the last place
you wanna go  hermano 
that s the lion s den 
it s nothing we haven t
done before 
yeah  with months
of planning 
and reliable information 
the element of surprise 
none of which we have now 
vince  i ve
thought this through 
would you just
hear me out 
the last time we
went off half cocked   
i lost everything 
you remember that 
look  i know
it s minho  all right 
but you can t ask me
to put those kids
on the line for one man 
i won t do it 
searching the grid now 
a is completed 
scanning b sector now 
shit  hit the lights 
let s go  let s go 
jeez 
they re getting close 
you re right 
we can t stay here 
where do you think
you re going then 
newt   
don t be a twat about it 
i m already in 
come on 
no  no  not this time 
look 
even if we find minho 
there s no guarantee
we make it back from this 
well  you ll need all the help
you can get then  won t you

together 
may as well
end it that way  too 
okay 
let s go get him back

hey  no  no  no 
wait  hey 
hey  wait  wait 
hey  it s okay  hey 
how s he doing 
breathing levels look strong 
oh  shit 
no  no 
it s not as effective
as the maze 
but it seems to be working 
it s promising 
but we ll need a larger sample
to work with 
all right 
carry on 
no  no 
you want us to go in there 
i don t wanna come across
as too negative 
but if i was a crank 
that s exactly
where i would be 
i don t think we have
much of a choice

hang on 
i m impressed 
you guys almost lasted
a whole day 
  you good 
  yeah 
i m sorry  i didn t wanna
bring you guys into this 
i think what
he s trying to say
is thanks for saving us 
you re welcome 
hey 
don t get your hopes up 
that checkpoint back there 
that was the city s
last defense 
if that was overrun 
chances are the city is  too 
yeah  unless they figured out
some other way
to keep the cranks out 
funny   
spent three years
trapped behind walls 
trying to break out 
and now we wanna
break back in 
yeah  it s hilarious 
jorge  how do we get in 
don t look at me  hermano 
those walls are new 
i guess that s wicked s
answer for everything 
well  we ain t gonna
figure it out from up here 
let s go 
you really think
he s in there 
i guess we ll find out 
you know she s
gonna be there  too 
we just have to make sure
we have the resources 
and i ll keep in touch 
excuse me 
are you ready 
it ll be fine 
people are beginning
to lose faith  doctor 
when you sealed off the walls 
you assured us
that it would only be
a temporary precaution 
why have you now
denied all entry 
because things are changing 
and not for the better 
infection rates were up 300  
fortunately 
we may be on the verge
of a breakthrough 
this is subject a7 
he spent over three years
in the maze trials 
the antibodies
produced in response
have been the strongest
we ve ever seen 
we re extracting
a new serum as we speak 
and with your support 
we d like to begin
human trials 
thank you  doctor 
that is very impressive 
but we have been
down this road before 
frankly  we are all beginning
to wonder if   
if our resources couldn t be
better spent elsewhere 
  meaning 
  safe zones 
protected areas
like the one we re in 
we could save
as many people as possible 
how many 
a thousand 
two thousand 
and that s assuming
your protected areas
stay protected 
which we know they won t 
the infected already outnumber
the healthy three to one 
all you d be doing
is delaying the inevitable 
have any of you ever lost
someone to the virus 
a niece 
anna 
i m sorry we weren t
able to help her 
but imagine if we were able
to live with the virus 
to survive it 
imagine being able
to tell anna
that you could give her the
chance to live a normal life 
we ve never been
this close to a cure 
and we ve sacrificed a lot
to get this far 
please 
don t let those sacrifices
be for nothing 
nicely done 
they can be a tough crowd 
you handled them perfectly 
 delaying the inevitable  
thomas used to say
the same about us 
do you still think about him 
i can help you with that 
those memories 
there s no reason
to keep holding on to them 
it s a simple procedure 
there is a reason 
i want to remember 
if we find a cure 
that s the only way all this
was worth it 
i hope you re right 
this place has really
gone through hell 
we just gotta stay together 
we are the voice
of the voiceless 
they hide
behind their walls 
thinking they can keep
the cure for themselves 
while they watch the rest
of us wither and rot 
but there are more of us
than there are of them 
and i say 
we rise up
and take back what is ours 
let s bring back a victory 
get janson 
let us in 
that s it  that s our way in 
let us in 
to the wall 
let us in 
let us in  let us in 
thomas 
this is not
what you re looking for 
all these people
trying to find their way in 
you think you re gonna
find something they can t 
came this far 
i m not turning back now 
what the hell
did we get ourselves into 
get out of my way 
get out of my way 
thomas  this
doesn t feel right 
you were right  sir 
the drone sweep picked him up
outside the walls 
get the guns online 
hey  guys  we gotta go now 
look 
let s go  let s go 
  thomas  let s go 
  we gotta get out of here 
let s go  let s go 
go  go  go  come on

we re all on
the same side here 
what do you mean same side 
who the hell are you 
hey  greenie 
gally 
no way 
no  wait 
hold 
stop  it s all right 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
stop  stop it 
stop 
  he killed chuck 
  yeah  i know 
i remember 
i was there too  all right 
but i also remember
that he was stung
and half out of his mind 
just calm down  all right 
come on 
kind of had that coming 
anybody else  fry  newt 
do you know this guy 
he was an old friend 
how 
how is this possible 
we watched you die 
no  you left me to die 
and if we hadn t found you
when we did 
you d be dead right now 
what the hell
are you doing here 
minho 
wicked has him here 
we re looking for a way in 
i can help with that 
follow me 
i m not going
anywhere with you 
suit yourself 
but i can get you
through those walls 
after the maze 
i got picked up by a group
headed to the city 
they realized i was immune 
patched me up 
and they brought me here
to lawrence 
this group s been at war
with wicked
ever since they took control
of the city 
but wicked can t hide behind
those walls forever 
day s gonna come 
and they re gonna pay
for what they ve done 
listen  uh 
he doesn t get
a lot of visitors 
so  let me do the talking 
all right 
and try not to stare 
rose took my nose 
i suppose 
rose took my nose  i suppose 
suppose  suppose 
took my nose   
i suppose 
gally 
glad to see you made it back 
jasper told me what happened 
it was a slaughter 
there s nothing we could do
against those guns 
no 
but they can only poke
the hornet s nest so long
before they get stung 
now  who are these people 
why are they here 
we need to get into wicked 
gally said you can get us
through the walls 
gally should know better
than to make promises
that he can t keep 
besides  that wall
is only half your problem 
getting inside wicked
is impossible 
there might be a way now 
but it doesn t work
without thomas 
is that so 
do you know what i am   
thomas 
i am a businessman 
which means that i don t
take unnecessary risks 
why should i trust you 
 cause i can help you 
you see  if you can get me
through those walls   
i can get you what you need 
what is it
that you think i need 
time 
every last drop 
is that what i need 
wicked has something
we both want 
i ll tell you what 
two can go for now 
the rest stay down here
with me 
just a little insurance
to make sure
you find your way back 
we have a deal 
gally  show him the way 
be careful  thomas 
gally  take care of these two 
yeah 
this is gross 
jesus 
yeah  this is great 
stay with me 
we got a ways to go 
we re ready 
shai 
hi  miss teresa 
hi 
hey 
how are you feeling 
okay 
is that gonna make me better 
i hope so 
do you remember the story
you were telling me 
about the house
you grew up in 
i don t remember 
the one by the lake 
it burns 
i know  i know 
there we go  all done 
you re so brave 
oh 
that is incredible 
how soon can you administer
to the infected 
you show a lot of compassion
for someone who just
opened fire on a crowd 
you told me to do my job 
i had a shot  i took it 
and missed  apparently 
the patrols
never found a body 
thomas is still out there 
what about her 
does she know 
no 
she can t 
i need her to stay focused 
elevate security levels
throughout the city 
i m counting on you
to handle this  janson 
red zone 
departing the station
in five minutes 
thank you 
this is a long way
from the glade 
fifteen
minutes to mandatory curfew 
please proceed home
in an orderly fashion 
remember 
this is for your safety 
thank you for your compliance 
yeah  we better
get off these streets 
and i know it s hard  but act
like you ve seen it before 
they ve definitely
upped security 
i m guessing you shanks have
something to do with that 
all right 
let s get outta here 
all right  newt  you re up 
i got it 
there it is 
if wicked s got minho 
that s where
they ll be keeping him 
lawrence has been trying
to find a way in for years 
place is crawling
with soldiers 
they got
surveillance everywhere 
scanners on every floor 
sounds like a bloody fortress 
yeah  i thought you said
you had a way in 
i might 
you might 
what the hell
do you mean  might  
take a look 
i said i had a way in 
i didn t say
you were gonna like it 
no  there s gotta be
another way 
like what 
you ve seen the building 
she is our only way in 
you really think
she s gonna help us 
i don t plan on
asking for her permission 
am i missing something here 
this is the same girl
who betrayed us  correct 
same dick 
i like her 
what s going on 
what  are you afraid
your little girlfriend s
gonna get hurt 
hmm 
because this has
obviously never been
just about rescuing minho 
has it 
wait  what are you
talking about 
teresa 
she s the only reason
that minho s even missing
in the first place 
now we finally have an
opportunity to get him back 
and what  you don t want to
because of her 
because deep down inside
you still care about her 
don t you 
just admit it 
  newt  i   
  don t lie to me 
don t lie to me 
sorry 
i m sorry 
sorry about that  back there 
i guess i can t
hide this anymore 
why didn t you tell me 
didn t think it would
make any difference 
all i know is that wicked
must have put me
in that maze for a reason 
maybe it was literally
just so they could tell
the difference
between immunes like you
and people like me 
you know we can
still fix this  newt 
okay  we can 
don t worry about me 
this is about minho 
now he needs us 
so if there is even
the slightest chance
that we can save him 
we can get him out of there 
then we have to take that 
no matter what the cost 
okay  i hear you 
let s get him up 
minho 
can you hear me 
there s a little girl here 
her name is shai lun 
she s been infected
for three weeks now 
but  minho 
you re going to save her 
and you can save
so many others 
everything we re doing here 
it s working 
do you understand 
that s why
this is so important 
i just wanted you to know 
teresa 
minho 
minho 
you re a traitor 
we trusted you 
  get off 
  hey  let her go 
get off me  get off me 
i ll kill you  you traitor 
you killed them all 
teresa  they need you
in the med lab 
it sounds serious 
i m sorry  teresa 
it s not your fault 
you did everything you could 
this is an alert 
curfew is now in effect 
anyone caught
in violation of curfew
will be subject
to immediate deportation 
thomas 
thomas 
hey  teresa 
you shouldn t be here 
if janson finds out
you re here   
i m not staying 
it s just  uh   
i had to see you 
i have to ask you something 
do you regret it 
what you did to us 
sometimes 
but i did
what i thought was right 
i d do it again 
good 
taking
the edge off  i see 
beautiful  isn t it 
yes 
  it s a lovely city 
  hmm 
the walls 
it s amazing what people
can accomplish
when their survival s
at stake 
squeeze them hard enough 
there s nothing they can t do 
no line they won t cross 
you ve had a bit of a setback 
it s nothing
we re not used to 
not this time 
the virus is airborne 
it s inside the walls 
that serum
was our last chance 
anyone not already infected
will be inside of a month 
okay 
we can handle this 
we just need to evacuate
essential personnel 
set up at another safe zone
farther north 
we ve still got 28 immunes
right inside this building 
we can find more 
you would 
you d hunt every last
one of them down
till there was no one left 
in spite of everything
we ve done to them 
everything we ve put
them through 
at least we gave
them the tools
they ll need to survive 
maybe they ll succeed
where we ve failed 
are you really telling me
that you re giving up 
after everything 
it s not about
giving up  janson 
it s about knowing
when you ve lost 
gally 
here s how this is gonna go 
we re gonna ask you
some questions 
and you re gonna tell us
exactly what we need to know 
we ll start off simple 
where s minho 
you guys don t
seriously think   
don t look at him 
why are you looking at him 
look at me 
he s not gonna help you 
now  we know you have minho
in the building 
where 
he s with the others
in holding 
sublevel three 
how many others 
28 
i can make that work 
no 
no  you guys don t understand 
the whole level s restricted 
you can t get in
without a thumbprint id 
that s why you re
gonna come with us 
well  i don t know 
we don t necessarily need her 
right 
not all of her 
  we just need her finger 
  gally  back off 
what 
are you squeamish 
i guarantee you she s done
a lot worse to minho 
that s not the plan 
back off 
it won t make
a difference 
do whatever you want to me 
you still won t get through
the front door 
the sensors will
pick you up the   
we know  we re tagged 
property of wicked 
you re gonna help us
with that  too 
try to relax 
this is gonna sting 
let s just get it over with 
she enjoyed that 
you re probably right 
here  see if these fit 
  thanks 
  thanks  newt 
better get going 
old man 
long road ahead of you 
you sure i can t
talk you out of this 
it s your last chance 
you know  it s not like you
to shy away from a fight 
and it s not like you
to go looking for one 
i just can t help but think
if i walk out that door   
i m never gonna see you again 
since when do we go sticking
our necks out for strangers 
i was a stranger once  too 
  just don t leave us hanging 
  no 
never 
she s looking good 
healthy 
how ve you been
getting her serum 
what are you talking about 
brenda 
i didn t think
she d still be alive 
when was her last treatment 
at the right arm 
the last time we saw you 
but that was months ago 
thomas  that s not possible 
she should have turned by now 
there s no way she
could possibly still   
all right  that s enough 
you don t believe me 
do you really
expect me to 
you made your choice 
everything okay over here 
yeah 
yeah  we re done 
nice try 
you were in love with her 
weren t you 
i don t know 
just be careful 
you sort of have this problem
where you can t
walk away from people 
even when you should 
you can t save everyone 
thomas 
i can try 
don t stop 
go  go  go 
hold on  hold on 
i can get in here 
stay there 
throw me the walkie 
frypan  we re in 
how you doing 
yeah  i m getting there 
tell minho  hi   for me 
hang in there  buddy

dear thomas   
this is the first letter
i can remember writing 
obviously  i don t know if i
wrote any before the maze 
but even if it s not my first 
it s likely to be my last 
i want you to know
that i m not scared 
well  not of dying  anyway 
it s more forgetting 
it s losing myself
to this virus 
that s what scares me 
so every night i ve been
saying their names out loud 
alby   
winston  chuck 
and i just repeat them
over and over 
like a prayer 
and it all comes
flooding back 
just the little things 
like the way
the sun used to
hit the glade
at that perfect moment
right before
it slipped beneath the walls 
and i remember the taste
of frypan s stew 
i never thought
i d miss that stuff so much 
and i remember you 
i remember the first time you
came up in the box 
just a scared little greenie
who couldn t even remember
his own name 
but from that moment
you ran into the maze 
i knew i would
follow you anywhere 
and i have 
we all have 
if i could do it
all over again  i would
and i wouldn t
change a thing 
and my hope for you
is that when you re looking
back years from now 
you ll be able
to say the same 
the future s
in your hands now  tommy 
and i know you ll find a way
to do what s right 
you always have 
take care of everyone for me 
and take care of yourself
