hyperventilating
ty can you breathe for me
breathing rapidly
in and out
breathing steadies
im breathing
im breathing
im
inhales and exhales deeply
im breathing
everybody cries
everybody dies
its the truth
that makes us one
its the center of our sun
as we take the lonely path
on the road
to the edge of man
beneath the darkening sky
we curse and wonder why
as fear wakes up the beast
and the devil comes to feast
and we sink in mortal sand
on the road
to the edge of man
who will be the last to die
in a land where empires cry
who will be
the last to remain
where theres only
god and pain
theres nothing more brave
than those voices
from the grave
only they can tell us why
only they will never lie
about the reason
that we stand
on the road
to the edge of man
who will be the last to die
in a land where empires cry
who will be
the last to remain
where theres only
god and pain
they warn us of the lie
with a mournful battle cry
of the reckoning at hand
as we reach the edge of man
and make our final stand
theres nowhere left to pray
where theres only god
and pain
where theres only god
he was on his
he was on his forearms
and his elbows and he went behind
he went towards
towards gallegos
and thats when i said hey
sergeant larson mace is alive
i can get to him
hes right there
and uh i think he looked
and he says
no you cant get to him
i say no hes right there
i can get to him
and he says
youre no good to him dead
and uh and i knew
i knew he was right but it
it ate me up so bad
i need a break
hold on
yeah
take as much time as you need
finished out the belt
and scurried on back
and i called gallegos
and told him
i told him i was sorry
clint youre one guy with no
ammunition facing 400 taliban
all of whom have
the high ground
you could always try
though chuckles
wed landed uh
at nighttime
but even at night
you could tell the
silhouettes of the mountain
and the sky were
did not give us
it did not give you
a very good sense of
this is a safe place
it gave me a quick
sense of impending doom
that it was just
a matter of time
before a bad thing happens
and and were gonna
well be in trouble
i remember when i first
landed at keating
um i got off the helicopter
and when you got
off the helicopter
youre supposed
to take a knee
cause the propeller blades
create such a prop blast
that it like pushes you over
but i was just like staring with
my mouth open looking at the
at all like the mountains
and just being in the valley
and it was so strange
i remember being down
in the middle of it
and just looking
up and up and up
and finally i could see like
the top of of the
the switchbacks
and it was just like
that all the way around
being able to play myself is
is unique
you know its a very
i dont know if that happens
very often in this industry
but as we were saying
just the realness of here
its put me back
into that mindset
and ive tried to embrace that
you know with the uniform
and you know the names of all
those soldiers that were lost
that are still
walking around here
you know doing their role
um i think its special
you know
and to be able
to play myself
im very grateful
that im still alive
and its almost
an obligation i feel
to bring authenticity
to this film
at at lras 2 five men
gave their lives to save mine
they were either directly at
that position or supporting it
and so when i wear the medal
i think about them
i also wear
the memorial bracelet
and in fact
most people think
of memorial day
as a time to celebrate or
or have hot dogs
but its actually a very somber time
to where we recognize what a lot
of men and women have died for
when i came in with the qrf
down the switchbacks
it was nighttime
and you could see the flames
against the canyon walls
um and in the flicker
of the flames
kind of dancing
on the canyon walls behind it
and in the buildings
over the course of that night
started they were razed i mean
they started falling to the ground
yeah
and i remember as i
as i walked the outpost
when the battle was over
and the buildings were
literally falling to the ground
i would see
um black spots on the ground
that were dark as motor oil
and then the flame
the light of the flames
from the buildings
would kind of illuminate it
just enough for me to see
that it was a very deep color
of red and thats
when i realized
oh this is where
this is where one of our soldiers died
its a very hard terrain
out in nuristan
its incredibly difficult to
to win a battle when youre
in the low ground like that
its its near impossible
i mean the only reason
it was possible for these guys
was because of some
very strong leadership
uh at the camp itself
and because they had an
immense amount of air support
um once it finally came in
i want people to know
about stephan mace
i want you know more people
to know about justin gallegos
and the six others
who died that day
vernon martin
i knew him for
for about three or four years
scusa i knew him
for about three or four years
from our deployment
to iraq together
and so i mean these
they were incredible people
incredible humans
uh that i think
its important
for more people to know
about these eight
that sacrificed themselves
and hopefully spark an interest
in learning more about
others that have
sacrificed themselves
for the greater good
of the united states security
in my own words
i would describe
combat outpost keating
as a
i dont know
i read somewhere in the bible
the gates of heaven
and the gates of hell
are in the same spot
so at the time of the firefight
this was the
the gates of hell
but watching men you know
sacrifice themselves
to protect each other
you can see the true form
of what uh
brotherhood and love is
