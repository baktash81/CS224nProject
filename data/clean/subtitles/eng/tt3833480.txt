 breathing rapidly 
in and out 
 breathing steadies 
i m breathing 
i m breathing 
i m   
 inhales and exhales deeply 
i m breathing 
  everybody cries
everybody dies  
  it s the truth
that makes us one  
  it s the center of our sun  
  as we take the lonely path  
  on the road
to the edge of man  
  beneath the darkening sky  
  we curse and wonder why  
  as fear wakes up the beast  
  and the devil comes to feast  
  and we sink in mortal sand  
  on the road
to the edge of man  
  who will be the last to die  
  in a land where empires cry   
  who will be
the last to remain  
  where there s only
god and pain   
  there s nothing more brave  
  than those voices
from the grave  
  only they can tell us why  
  only they will never lie  
  about the reason
that we stand  
  on the road
to the edge of man  
  who will be the last to die  
  in a land where empires cry   
  who will be
the last to remain  
  where there s only
god and pain   
  they warn us of the lie  
  with a mournful battle cry  
  of the reckoning at hand  
  as we reach the edge of man  
  and make our final stand  
  there s nowhere left to pray  
  where there s only god  
  and pain  
  where there s only god     
he was on his   
he was on his forearms 
and his elbows  and he went behind 
he went towards   
towards gallegos 
and that s when i said   hey 
sergeant larson  mace is alive 
 i can get to him 
he s right there  
and  uh  i think he looked 
and he says 
 no  you can t get to him  
i say   no  he s right there 
i can get to him  
and he says 
 you re no good to him dead  
and  uh    and i knew 
i knew he was right  but it   
it ate me up so bad 
i need a break 
hold on 
yeah 
take as much time as you need 
finished out the belt
and scurried on back 
and i called gallegos
and told him   
i told him i was sorry 
clint  you re one guy with no
ammunition  facing 400 taliban 
all of whom have
the high ground 
you could always try 
though   chuckles 
we d landed  uh 
at nighttime 
but even at night 
you could tell the
silhouettes of the mountain
and the sky were   
did not give us   
it did not give you
a very good sense of
 this is a safe place  
it gave me a quick
sense of impending doom 
that it was just
a matter of time
before a bad thing happens 
and    and we re gonna   
we ll be in trouble 
i remember when i first
landed at keating 
um  i got off the helicopter 
and when you got
off the helicopter 
you re supposed
to take a knee 
 cause the propeller blades
create such a prop blast
that it  like  pushes you over 
but i was just  like  staring with
my mouth open  looking at the   
at all    like  the mountains 
and just being in the valley 
and it was so strange 
i remember being down
in the middle of it 
and just looking
up  and up  and up 
and finally  i could see  like 
the top of    of the   
the switchbacks 
and it was just like
that all the way around 
being able to play myself is   
is unique 
you know  it s a very   
i don t know if that happens
very often in this industry 
but as we were saying 
just the realness of here 
it s put me back
into that mindset 
and i ve tried to embrace that 
you know  with the uniform
and  you know  the names of all
those soldiers that were lost 
that are still
walking around here 
you know  doing their role 
um  i think it s special 
you know 
and to be able
to play myself 
i m very grateful
that i m still alive 
and it s almost
an obligation  i feel 
to bring authenticity
to this film 
at    at lras 2  five men
gave their lives to save mine 
they were either directly at
that position or supporting it 
and so when i wear the medal 
i think about them 
i also wear
the memorial bracelet 
and in fact 
most people think
of memorial day
as a time to celebrate or   
or have hot dogs 
but it s actually a very somber time 
to where we recognize what a lot
of men and women have died for 
when i came in with the qrf
down the switchbacks 
it was nighttime 
and you could see the flames
against the canyon walls 
um  and in the flicker
of the flames
kind of dancing
on the canyon walls behind it 
and in the buildings
over the course of that night 
started    they were razed  i mean 
they started falling to the ground 
yeah 
and i remember as i   
as i walked the outpost
when the battle was over 
and the buildings were
literally falling to the ground 
i would see 
um  black spots on the ground
that were dark as motor oil 
and then the flame 
the light of the flames
from the buildings
would kind of illuminate it 
just enough for me to see
that it was a very deep color
of red  and that s
when i realized 
 oh  this is where   
this is where one of our soldiers died  
it s a very hard terrain
out in nuristan 
it s incredibly difficult to   
to win a battle when you re
in the low ground like that 
it s    it s near impossible 
i mean  the only reason
it was possible for these guys
was because of some
very strong leadership 
uh  at the camp itself 
and because they had an
immense amount of air support 
um  once it finally came in 
i want people to know
about stephan mace 
i want  you know  more people
to know about justin gallegos
and the six others
who died that day 
vernon martin 
i knew him for   
for about three or four years 
scusa  i knew him
for about three or four years
from our deployment
to iraq together 
and so  i mean  these   
they were incredible people 
incredible humans 
uh  that    i think
it s important
for more people to know
about these eight
that sacrificed themselves
and hopefully spark an interest
in learning more about
others that have
sacrificed themselves
for the greater good
of the united states  security 
in my own words 
i would describe
combat outpost keating
as a   
i don t know 
i read somewhere in the bible 
the gates of heaven
and the gates of hell
are in the same spot 
so at the time of the firefight 
this was the   
the gates of hell 
but watching men  you know 
sacrifice themselves
to protect each other 
you can see the true form
of what  uh 
brotherhood and love is
