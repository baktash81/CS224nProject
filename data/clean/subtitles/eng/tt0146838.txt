sit down  listen up 
who are you throwing to  the receiver 
or you got some other shit on your mind 
we just lost two goddamn quarterbacks   
   in one half of football   
   because our line   
   couldn t pick up a backside bandit
on max protection 
all week long we work on the calls 
over  over  over again 
you are not fucking focused  
mckenna  what are you doing  
keep your head on a swivel 
slide out there  pick up that robber 
roll up those outside linebackers 
know your site adjustments 
understand 
sanderson and fox
will break off their routes   
   but you gotta be there and deliver 
two turnovers in one half 
defense 
this is what we gotta do here 
i don t know 
you gotta do something out there 
you gotta make it happen 
you gotta stop flying around the ball 
tackle somebody 
don t let these guys
chew up the clock on us 
when we put eight in a box 
you gotta jam those receivers 
if you make mistakes  make them big 
i won t eat your lunch for that 
here we got p j  
mac  beastman  horny  shark 
one two yards less each time   
   they ll be looking at second and 8 
instead of second and 6 
we re only down by 3 
we can win this 
we got three losses in a row 
i m sick and tired of this 
are you 
because if you re not 
raise your hand  come on 
if you re going to act like a loser 
raise your hand 
if you re going to act like pussy 
raise your hand 
what are you doing  j

it s just moving so fast 
believe me when i tell you this 
you can only get better 
and you don t have to worry about
getting the hook   
   because i got no one left 
i m playing like shit 
i ain t playing like myself 
you know how to play 
you played this game your whole life 
you know what i m saying 
you grew up in dallas  right 
so maybe you re back in dallas
right now 
you re home  you re enjoying yourself 
you re back in the  hood just before
your mama calls you in for dinner 
i say    go to the buick 
turn around  i ll throw it to you   
  remember that 
  something like that 
what i m saying is 
you gotta forget it all 
the crowd  the audibles 
the goddamn playbook 
just focus on this next one pass 
go to the buick  turn around 
turn around 
enjoy it 
that s what you re here for 
slot  throw it 
forget the whole goddamn playbook 
just focus on this one next pass 
he s got it  he s got it 
touchdown  sanderson 
and what a feeling it must be
for young willie beamen 
it s his first affa touchdown 
the sharks are back in the ball game 
let s kick some extra point 
let s get off the field 
where did we find this guy  johnny 
i think arnie spotted him
before he left 
d amato s gotta go for it  if he gets
first down  he can run out the clock 
  what s with these plays 
  i can t get in his face 
tell him he s gotta take a chance 
  i m doing my best 
  turn up the volume 
red beats read 
they re giving us the flat 
  let s run smoke and throw 
  they re looking for the pick 
i m not taking any chances 
not with this ballerina 
third down and five 
they re screaming for him to dump it 
it s wide open 
i know this coach  he s a prick 
this is a setup  i ve seen this 
we ll run it again 
let s do it 
let s do deuce left 22    
run the same play  
all the sharks have to do
is hold on to the ball 
it s money time  give me five 
we home and dry and flying high 
let the d win it  j man 
we don t need no first down 
that s why you don t score
with the ladies 
same play  same play 
on two 
call time out  they re stacked up
against the run 
time out s for tv  negative 
fumble 
he fumbled 
loose ball  minnesota s got it 
how stupid  how selfish 
julian washington fumbles the ball 
in your face 
you wonder if the million dollar
bonus when he reaches 1500 yards   
   didn t play into that one 
that s right  kev  and now d amato s
lost four games in a row 
two hands 
with two hands  you showboat 
honey  please don t feel too bad 
we lost once 
all of a sudden   
   one of these real tall gentlemen   
   jumped up so high   
   and he just picked that thing
out of that air just like that 
and i thought your daddy    
i thought he d have a heart attack 
he died because of this 
i don t want you to take anything
so seriously  honey 
  it s just a game  honey 
  good night  mother 
  good night  darling 
  at least the dog still loves her 
make sure she gets home  all right 
no stops 
shall i wait up 
no  i d be a lousy date tonight 
don t forget i m in boston tomorrow

it s a complicated deposition 
i m sorry  i forgot 
kick their asses 
tomorrow morning  first thing 
make it three 
you want a walk through 
let it go  willie 
you played strong 
i m just sick of losing 
when you re my age 
you get used to it 
all right  everybody  listen up 
played your hearts out there today 
no blame  nobody 
let s take a knee  father 
you and i have been in some tough
places together  haven t we 
i went to my playbook 
and the book says the rain falls
on the just and the unjust alike 
now  we just lost four in a row 
that doesn t mean
that we re specially cursed 
joy comes in the morning 
there are no atheists in foxholes 
let s pray 
  our father  who art in heaven     
  how you doing  rock 
  i felt like i was gonna die 
they went in and they sucked out   
   my l 5 disk 
it s no big deal 
  did we win 
  they beat us by three 
what d the kid throw 
nine of 14 for 176 
tds 
two 
holy moly 
i can beat this 
cindy  will you please call that nurse  
this doesn t work  i m a football
player  they gotta pump up the volume 
breathe 
don t overachieve 
even at 50      nobody s better 
playoffs   
   i ll be ready 
it s getting late  i m gonna stop by
in the morning  you get some rest 
  good night  cindy 
  good night 
don t you give up on me 
you re like a son to me  cap 
i ll fight for you till the day i die 
willie beamen  i don t believe you 
your first big game on tv 
and you didn t let your own mama know 
here it is right here 
not that willie didn t have some
nauseating moments of his own 
poor guy 
are you gonna start 
you could at least play first string 
no  probably not 
let s hope willie beamen
brings his tums with him 
  you should be starting 
  mom  i m number three 
there ain t nothing
i can do about it 
you ve been at this for 5 years 
tell everybody i said i love them 
and i ll see them 
  i love you too  willie 
  i love you 
baby  she just wants the best for you 
yeah  i know she does 
you did great 
you gotta wonder why d amato
would call that play   
   when j man likes to pick his spot
when he runs 
calling the same play twice 
what s that about 
there s a reason this team s
lost four games in a row 
forget about the offensive line 
and forget about cap rooney 
forget about the money grubbing
christina pagniacci 
hello  genius 
this guy started coaching
in the late  60s  for god s sake 
i m glad he s not talking about me 
  here you go  coach 
  thank you 
this is a team with more than 200
variations on the pass 
napoleon d amato s playbook s
got less than 75 plays  total 
200 variations on a pass 
what s wrong with this picture 
you re that coach  right 
i m mandy  mandy murphy 
you look better in real life 
you re always yelling at people on tv 
at least i look better
than that old fart up there  no 
i think

  how old are you 
  i don t think age matters 
i think older guys have a certain thing 
i ve wanted to meet you since i was 16 
you were on the sidelines 
you were winning this big game 
the pantheon cup  yeah 
that was it 
god  that s so wild 
so you promise to keep a secret 
i don t know  how do you mean 
on a date 
i got a place 
it s close by  it s quiet 
it s a thousand 
five thousand for the night 
you won t regret it 
i m flattered  thank you  but    
i got friends 
i could do your friends too 
  some other time maybe 
  fair enough 
good luck 
i ll be rooting for you 
  thank you 
  coach 
i know you re not gonna
pass on that  d amato 
i must be drunk 
  christina pagniacci 
who s so smart   
   she sold three of last year s
starters in the off season 
you think you can lose
your coaching instincts 
you never had them 
how you gonna lose them

i lose those  i got nothing 
please leave your name and message
and we ll get right back to you 
have a nice day  bye bye

i d like to get together with him   
   but i don t have his new number 
i really miss the shit out of
little timmy and melinda 
and you 
grandkids 
we got grandkids 
why did we get divorced anyway 
fuck 
if you d like to make a call 
please hang up and try again 
shit 
we re gonna make a difference
this week 
just the tip of the ball  catch it 
this ain t no bullshit west virginia 
you in the big leagues 
what the fuck is that  what are you 
a pussy  that ain t no damn hit 
  14 years  i know how to hit 
  14 years  you re captain 
show me 
break that shit up 
goddamn it  baby  you did it 
that s my boy  my brotherfucker 
that s the way to hit it  shark 
that is the way to hit it 
now  come on in here 
let me get this straight 
the california governor says there s
nothing for the public to vote on 
she s got the finances to build
a new stadium in los angeles   
   using lottery money 
jeez  ed 
l a  s a dream 
certainly good enough to leverage the
city of miami into a new stadium 
what about the rosenthal bid 
 250 million 
it s so low 
with a new stadium and a winning team   
   this club is worth  800 million 
it s me 
you re like your dad 
you re a dreamer 
take the money 
you re still young  darling 
start over  start a family 
you don t love football anyway 
it s none of your business  ed 
let s keep this between the three of us 
  morning  tony 
  morning  christina 
alka seltzer 
no  thank you 
i had about four for breakfast 
this is a hell of a loss  tony 
i can see how my mom could drink herself
into a stupor watching football games 
but this kind of play makes me
want to jump out of a window 
well  you can run this a billion times 
but on any given sunday  
  you ll either win or you ll lose 
the point is  can you win or lose
like a man    dad said lots of things 
actually  i said that 
but he could never stand losing 
and julian couldn t resist
going for his bonus yards 
blame me  not julian 
that was my call 
i know it was  tony 
it s four in a row 
this season is a disaster 
without the playoffs 
there s no more tv money 
you see this 
they want your head 
your father would laugh at them 
this is a good team 
we hit  we win 
we put pressure  we win 
we penetrate  we win  you do it as
tough as it is possible to do 
and you do that in all things 
you die hard 
that s what i m talking about 
you die hard 
dad used to say 
  no intensity  no victory   
where the hell is your intensity 
tony 
four years ago 
we won the pantheon cup 
  i was there  remember 
  now what are we 
we re a second tier team  that s what 
admit it  you re not being honest 
we re a solid football team 
we re just not inspired 
too many free agents 
we got julian  he s a merc 
end of the season  he s gone 
next year  we rebuild our running game 
you talk about a running game  but
who cares as long as you re winning 
people want to see passes  touchdowns 
high scores  that s the game today 
i paid a lot of money
to get nick crozier here   
   specifically to modernize  
football s played on a field 
not in the goddamn boxes 
you knew that when you had candy
stuck in your braces 
if we had gotten the linemen i wanted   
   our first two quarterbacks
would still be walking 
think of the future 
do you know what we could get for cap 
probably a second
and a third draft choice 
we know that he s finished but  
i don t know that cap is finished 
do i have to remind you
that he helped build this franchise 
he s a hero to the working people
of florida 
probably one of the greatest pressure
players of all time 
you can t cut cap  
cap and shark were great 
but memories  
shark changed linebacking forever 
he made a quantum leap in the game 
that s why we ll say goodbye
to both of them   
   with dignity  with class 
i won t cut cap or shark no matter
how much class you do it with 
my contract s very clear on this point 
i coach my way 
we make less money
than 90    of the other teams 
  the economics  
  fuck the economics 
your father  you hear me  your father
didn t interfere  he made it work 
that s because you were a fighter 
you had intensity 
as much as i respect   
   my famous uncle tony   
   the players are just not
responding to you 
art  may he rest in peace 
spent money like water 
but in the modern game
with the marketing costs  
listen  i will do anything to bring
this team back to greatness 
i guess i had nothing to do with that 
that was all your dad 
am i excused now 
jeez  who s playing the child now 
everybody s got to renegotiate 
and that means you too 
are you saying my contract s up
at the end of the season 
the economics aren t there 
that what you re saying 
you know  you re not giving me
a whole lot to work with 
you know how your dad and i negotiated
my contract  we had a beer 
we shook hands 
well  i don t drink beer  tony 
i don t imagine you do  no 
fucking beer

i guess you re saying you re
influenced by what other people think 
i think we all are  in business 
and it s   
     pagniacci   
eat this  you fucking pussies 
i m sorry  baby  i m sorry 
reebok s got this ad campaign   
   ready to go the moment i hit
2000 yards  but it s abc  man 
i don t get the ball  i don t get
my stats  i don t get my money 
this team isn t about your damn stats 
that s a winning attitude  j 
how much you paying that
300 pound blocker 
let him block 
because he sure can t run like i can 
j man s got a point 
beamen ain t doing his homework 
he won t read the playbook 
he won t come see the films 
he doesn t even know the names
of the defense he s facing 
he don t give
a gee whiz about anybody 
he just wants
to make the plays himself 
he s young  cap 
he doesn t know how to read like you 
what do you mean  he s young 
come on  he just does what he likes 
he s changing the plays in the huddle 
plays that you designed  that i love 
he s dissing this play and dissing
that play    i got a better play   
guys  we won 
what s the point 
i m trying to get paid 
that s the point 
the point is  if we don t win 
you can t do your commercials 
what do you know 
you re an offensive coordinator 
jesus christ 
keep your mouth shut 
get this shit straight  coach 
i m with you  man 
it s all right  j 
anything else 
hey  guess what 
coach suddenly invited me
over for dinner 
or orders me  more like 
that means you made it  boy 
the coach thinks you re the real deal 
invites you to his house   
   makes the worst jambalaya 
better bring some flowers 
coach gets really pissed off
if you don t bring flowers 
flowers 
trust me  man 
when 
saturday

got a gig over at my house 
going to be a lot of trim 
don t bring no sand to the beach 
come on  i m a born again ladies  man 
i bet you were born again  baby 
with a team  hotshot  you can try
to lead them  but will anyone follow 
you go out there on your own 
you re gonna die a very lonely death 
you feeling me 
say  cap  how old are you again 
we got a problem 
there s something wrong with shark 
brilliant  did you
go to medical school for that 
his eye hand coordination s
deteriorating 
he s fucked up  the crazier they are 
the more the crowd likes it 
this isn t pro wrestling 
he needs an mri 
you gonna order a  20 000 workup
for every nutcase on this team 
could have a subdural hematoma 
intracranial bleeding 
or he could just be
a crazy fucker  okay 
they walk on that field every sunday 
they got only one thing going for them 
their confidence 
you chip away at that
with a bunch of unnecessary testing   
   and we can kiss
the playoffs goodbye 
are you saying
i can t do the tests on shark 
jesus christ 
i ll take care of it 
i have earned their trust 
you haven t  good night 
hey  baby 
  what s the matter 
  who s courtney 
i don t know who courtney is 
why are you starting your shit 
what s it like to be a nobody one day
and have the world know you the next 
i was always a star 
y all just didn t know about it 
it ain t the whole world 
two billion people in china
ain t never heard of the game 
sharks are in the water 
the busboy  steamin  beamen 
what you think 
it s all to the good 
let s get out of here 
this studio time ain t cheap 
take over 
i ll be doing this every day 
gotta get to work
that s right
you know my name

give generously
to child find of america 
and let s make every kid

you should have fought for
that   superstar   line 
  giving      team sport   
those are the lines 
meanwhile  honey 
you used to do this spot alone 
finished 
take care of julian for me 
i know this guy 
he s a top plastic surgeon 
i think i could get him
to see you tonight 
oh  motherfucker 
inflate your chest  get met rx 
yo  rocky 
enough  you re gonna hurt yourself 
kid s breathing down my neck 
jack  he s not even close 
you re the man 
  less on the ball  willie 
  what 
you want a cool  tight spiral 
don t pat the ball 
it was tight as a frog s ass 
i m the man 
you re the man  i repeat  don t

i said    i m as tight as fish pussy   
i need an interpreter 
okay  cap  sit down 
i m fine  fine 
you got the balls 
come on  just get some rest 
let s go 
bottom line  rooney is like
some kind of medical miracle 
he really could be ready for new york 
have you told anyone 
i ve been on for 12 years
and two rings 
give me a break  i played hurt before 
it s no big deal 
he s so freaked about beamen taking his
job  he d play with a fractured neck 
could you slow him down 
tell him he s not responding
to rehab well enough 
let s give beamen a shot 
we re going with willie
against new york 
rest up till the playoffs 
the emperors don t mean enough for you
to risk everything 
home field advantage 
that don t mean anything 
everyone knows
herniated discs are iffy 
this is how it starts  huh 
i know what you re talking about 
i know how your mind works 
  rest up   
  let the kid take a few games   
  you were great  but time marches on   
  that s not what i m saying 
  the heck you re not 
i know the game of football 
  what about shark 
  he s woozy still 
he s got bad migraines 
postconcussive syndrome 
don t get a hard on  don t move 
can you clear him 
he s had 3 concussions in 5 months 
there s no way to predict what
another head hit would do 
i don t think anything ll happen 
but i m not a complete prick 
i do have a conscience 
i m not trying to screw him  harvey   
   but i d like him in the playoffs 
long term  what are you thinking 
what am i thinking 
bottom line 
we ll cut him in the off season 
the word s out 
everyone s seen him take the hits 
nobody s gonna sign a
two million dollar concussion case 
he ll be happy to have his job back
at 30    of what he makes 
that s if we want him back 
he s got four kids  christina 
you do the math  doctor 
what you help save us now 
we won t forget at contract time 
what do i tell tony 
tell him what he needs to know 
shark can play  cap can t 
  in these high beautiful heels 
  you know what you need 
  a pump 
you need to be   
   young again 
you got me 
i like going downfield 
that s my game  i open it wide open 
the fans want it  old timers
don t dig it  like coach stone age 
i beg your pardon    coach stone age   
is that what you just said 
it s up and it s good  baby 
that s a name i give him 
i don t mean disrespect 
tell me about your past 
where did you start 
in houston  but the coach didn t dig
having a black quarterback 
i guess he felt our brains
was no bigger than the tip of his  
and then i went to san diego 
coach made me cornerback
because he felt i had quick feet 
no  wait  leave him on  he s cool 
  cool   
thinks he s joe montana already 
they didn t know what i was 
i mean  he doesn t buy into the
bullshit  you know  i like his eyes 
life ain t fair 
and fair ain t what i m here for 
he s sure of himself 
it makes him sexy 
i m glad i m old 
check all right 
i m not surprised  rookie thinks he s
hot shit and all pro all of a sudden 
did you feed the dogs 
  put the kids to bed 
  can t we afford a maid 
why d i get married 
are you saying black people
are being dissed in this league 
i see what you re doing 
you re doing that media spin 
let s talk about the facts 
70    of the league is african american 
  how many black coaches do you have 
  very few 
  how many black owners 
  none 
zero 
at what point does the   uncle tom  
feel come into it  not my language   
it is because we didn t speak it
when we got here 
but   coach stone age      
your smack is so fresh  so on time
and truthful  give me a pound  dog 
  share the love 
  i ll pass on the love 
you get it started  okay 
  hope you like cream in your coffee 
  yes  i do 
mandy   
   i like you 
i m wondering 
maybe we could make this   
   you know  a more regular thing 
yeah  i got a few clients like that 
we could book a regular time 
i ll give you my number  
no  i sort of meant  
not like that 
without the money 
  i know  but  
  no  you don t want to do this 
i really like you 
i like you too 
tony  you don t want to do this 
call me 
you got pretty hair 
  got you flowers 
  these for me 
  thank you 
  carnations 
i ll put them in water or something 
come on in 
want a beer 
yeah 
sharky motherfucker 
nice spot 
yeah  isn t it 
the gladiators of their time 
that s what it s all about 
i don t cook so well 
but you gotta try this jambalaya 
  ready 
  i m always ready 
it was my recipe  sort of 
how do you like it 
it s   hot 
let s talk about some basics 
you getting ready to yell at me 
cap going down was tough on me 
i realize you re learning the system 
pressure must be incredible 
  i can handle it 
  i know you can 
if the playbook is too complicated 
we simplify it 
playbook s too slow 
when i m on the field 
i gotta feel it  gotta let it out 
that why you ve been changing the plays 
i m just trying to read the defense 
i m not talking about audibles 
talking about in the huddle 
when you change plays 
you show disrespect to people 
people who have worked years
in this club 
people who ve sacrificed more than
you ll ever know to be in this game 
i m trying to win  coach 
i ain t trying to disrespect nobody 
winning is the only thing i respect 
listen very carefully 
one day you ll realize this is
the truest thing you ever heard 
this game    
this game has got to be
about more than winning 
you re part of something 
lombardi  tittle  sammy baugh  unitas 
those men on the wall 
you re part of that now 
i want you to cherish it
because when it s gone   
   it s gone forever 
when i look at them pictures
and trophies  it just makes me sad 
it s like a room full of ghosts 
when i m done with this game   
   i don t want to be no ghost 
i wanna be more than that 
looks like cap s gonna make it
back in time for the playoffs 
  what 
  i m gonna start him 
i knew you were gonna sell me out 
cap s a leader  he s a team player 
that s such bullshit 
he ain t half the athlete i am 
you look me in the eye and tell me
that cap is a better player 
cap s a better player 
i guess somebody else
won them last two games 
he lost four in a row 
i lead by doing 
you kicked ass 
but cap rooney has been doing it
for years 
and his time is over 
and yours is too 
unless you take some risk 
play this game the way
it s played today 
it s not about
the pictures on the wall 
i ve lived this game
for three decades  kid 
i know football 
  those men on the wall  
  they wanted to win 
just like you do 
you can feed the press that whole
sacrifice and glory of the game crap 
but i been there 
i seen a long line of coaches   
   with that same old bullshit
halftime speech 
  bullshit 
  yes  it s bullshit 
you know it s bullshit
because it s about the money 
the tv contracts 
fat cat boosters in the skyboxes 
coaches trying to up their salaries 
you looking for the next black stud
to take it to the top 10 
get you in a bowl game 
it s the same way in the pros 
except in the pros 
the field hands get paid 
don t play that race card on me  kid 
25 years i work with men
of your color 
maybe it s not racism 
maybe it s placism 
brother has to know his place 
right  boss 
i don t understand
what you re talking about 
you don t trust anybody
because of what happened in college 
you knew the rules 
you were the one that broke them 
  how did i break them 
  how 
i lost a million dollar
signing bonus   
   because i took a  300 suit
from a booster to go to a wedding 
what s a brother supposed to do
in college  he ain t got money 
he wants to go out on a date 
wants to get some nice clothes 
everybody had their hands out   
   but it was me they suspended 
i dropped six rounds in the draft
because of that 
the coaches labeled me    he s trouble 
he don t wanna play ball   
you talk about sacrifice 
i sacrificed   10 million because dumb
rednecks like the coach in san diego   
   made me a cornerback
because i got quick feet 
he separated my shoulder tackling
250 pound motherfuckers 
i don t do that 
i was a great football player 
but nobody let my shoulder heal 
and they traded me out of there 
you go ahead 
blame everybody but yourself 
whatever 
because that s what a leader s about 
sacrifice 
the times he s gotta sacrifice
because he s gotta lead by example 
not by fear and not by self pity 
who you think you re talking to 
half my career is over
and you want me on the bench   
   to sacrifice for the glory
of cap rooney  fuck you 
i ain t buying your brand 
just because you some scared old man 
you feel like if i play my way 
i just might win 
then what was your life about anyway 
you re not some flash in the pan
corner or receiver   
   or even julian washington 
you re a goddamn quarterback 
you know what that means  
it s the top spot  kid 
it s the guy takes the fall 
it s the guy everybody s looking at
first  the leader of a team 
who will support you
when they understand you 
who will break their ribs and their
noses and their necks for you   
   because they believe 
because you make them believe 
that s a quarterback 
i m the leader of your team   
   till cap s back up 
then i m back on the bench 
you ain t said two words to me
till cherubini went down 
then it was    go out there and   
   play like you re in the  hood 
you re throwing the ball   
   and your mama s
ringing the dinner bell   
all you do is talk at me  man 
i m gonna stay who i am 
steamin  willie beamen 
with the time i got left 
i ll play my way  get my dollars up 
so when you go to waive me  trade me
or whatever the fuck y all do   
   i ll be worth 10 times what
i was worth before i got here 
you re very  very young 
and you re very  very stupid 
what re you doing  get off the lawn 
it s mr  beamen  willie  how you doing 
it s about winning  that s what this
country s about  being number one 
this whole country was built
on kicking immigrant ass 
african ass  chinese ass 
don t matter who ass 
get the fuck out 
get the fuck out of here  bitch 
every kid can grow up
to be president  right 
who the hell want to grow up
and be vice president 
there ain t no number twos
in football 
homeboy  welcome to the pit 
you come to my house 
you bring me no flowers 
you played me 
blowjobs upstairs  if you want
the skin  trawl the beach 
don t mess the sheets 
my wife s back on tuesday 
  i won t spill a drop 
  hey  no semen  no blood 
goddamn 
you tell me 
who lost the pantheon cup last year 
who came in second
at the 100 yard dash in the olympics 
where i m from  either you re
number one  or you ain t sh   
that s a fact 
did you get
the vince lombardi speech 
he was in my face
like we lost the game 
i got out of dallas because
i worked harder than anybody else 
you make it and get the big car 
or you don t and catch the bus   
   and you in the funeral home 
because to me  losing is dying 
  losing is dying   
i am down with that 
i think we d be top dog
if the defense would step up 
lay off the d  man  shark hear you
saying that  he ll kick your ass 
like i give a fuck 
i m trying to win some games 
i ain t trying to kiss
no overrated loser s ass 
what you care about 
you playing for yourself 
what you talking about  punk 
you gotta earn the right
to diss somebody on this team 
you call this a team 
i see a bunch of super fly
brothers running around   
   living in the white man s world   
   getting their dicks sucked by ho s 
j  you were a great football player 
now you done turn into a joke 
you re playing 
but you re dying inside 
what the fuck you mean 
i m dying inside 
kiss my armani ass  know what i did for
this team  i ll take your life  man 
football is a corporation 
black kids are raised
to be stars  individuals 
they do not learn to work together 
  beamen s talking shit about you 
  what  
talking about how we d be on top
if the defense would do their job 
fucking kidding me 
motherfucker  i ll break a piece
off in his goddamn ass 
what the fuck is wrong with you 
motherfucker  
in football  you have
the offense and the defense 
you can t have one without the other 
respect will be paid 
somebody call you a cab 
get out of my house 
but isn t this an awesome new york
pass rush coming at you 
when you re out there 
is the fear in the belly 
the fear and the terror 
no  i don t feel none of that 
they won t touch me  they won t
feel me  they won t even smell me 
i don t care if it s the t rex
or the terminator chasing me 
i got this invisible juice 
once i turn it on  i m gone 
stay down  motherfucker 
beamen is sacked again 
he goes down hard 
they won t play for him  tony 
let him fucking learn  then 
welcome back
to the monsoon bowl  folks 
the emperors have been eating
shark patties all night long 
smash mouth football 
this is what it s all about 
halfback up the middle 
lavay steps up to fill the gap   
   misses the tackle 
the emperors block their way
into the end zone  it s a touchdown 
good job  offense  way to play 
just about everything that can
go wrong has here today 
murphy s law in effect
for tony d amato 
can i get some fucking protection  
if you re not blocking 
get the fuck out the way 
loudmouth showboat motherfucker 
where s your steam now  willie 
you fuckers wanna make it tough  
i can take that shit 
come contract time 
there ll be a whole bunch of changes 
just give us the play 
it ll be you or me 
and it ain t gonna be me 
and there goes home field advantage
for the sharks 
although their season ends on a low
note  there s still life after death 
look for them in the playoffs   
   in tough town  u  s a   
dallas  texas 
there goes that black dynasty
you promised me  darling 
what s the matter 
forgot your invisible juice 
stop this now 
thirty years in football   
   i never seen something
stinks like this 
today out there   
   you embarrassed yourselves 
today   
   i m ashamed to be your coach 
lucky for him  some of these sharks
still have teeth left in their head 
tell you the truth 
they remind me of my ex 
i don t know what more i can do 
doesn t make sense 
my not having a home  a life 
game s all that matters to me 
because it s pure 
four quarters 
you cross a line  you score 
it s sane  life isn t 
life is fucked 
it s a new world  tony 
in my day  we used to just be happy
to get the goddamn job 
i used to shovel liquor
in the off season 
you know  sell used cars  insurance 
some of the guys used to even wrestle 
but  shit  now  prima dogs 
bodies that are year round great 
but crack just like china 
it s tv 
changed everything 
changed the way we think forever 
i mean  the first time
they stopped the game   
   to cut away to a fucking commercial 
that was the end of it 
because it was our concentration
that mattered  not theirs 
not some fruitcake selling cereal 
who wants to think about blitzes
when you re holding your grandkids 
you gonna miss your friend
screaming in your face   
   embarrassing you
in front of your players 
that s why i wanna coach high school 
get back to the basics 
kids don t know nothing 
they just wanna play 
like you said  tony   
   it s pure 
so what are the odds 
well  there s no telling 
it s an odontoid fracture 
basically  luther  you broke your neck 
and it never healed correctly 
it s hard to predict
this kind of thing   
   but what i can say is
that the wrong kind of hit   
   could result
in paralysis  seizures   
   even sudden death 
what else is new 
in my opinion   
   he is not medically fit to play 
i need one sack
and three more tackles   
   and i get my bonus  then we ll talk 
okay  motherfucker 
come on  luther 
have you ever seen
an old punch drunk boxer   
   stumbling around drooling   
   with no memory of
what he s done in his life 
you want that life  luther 
you need me against texas  don t you 
don t you 
of course i need you against texas 
but not   
   not at this price  no 
for a million dollars  i will shake
like a coconut on a tree if i got to 
coach  i gave you 13 years 
you can give me one 
football s my life  coach 
it s my life 
it s all i know how to do 
please  man 
come on  coach  please 
you have to sign a waiver  shark 
bring it on  man  bring it on 
coach 
we need to have
a discussion about harvey 
where the hell s d amato 
don t you ever say that
your papa didn t believe in you 
don t believe what your mom says 
you evil motherfucker 
come over here 
shark s film 
i know what you did  asshole 
you switched the results
so powers wouldn t pick up on it 
princess  i ll call you right back 
granted  it could look that way
to a layperson 
i want you out of here 
you re taking the high road 
you didn t consult with him 
he could get killed out there 
you didn t consult with him  
i m gonna consult with a player 
i knew his answer 
getting killed  maybe  maybe not 
one chance in 1000 
but nobody blitzes
like the shark  right 
i never wanna see you near
one of my players again 
they couldn t take a piss
in the morning without their pills 
you re gonna play innocent 
fuck your innocence 
what about beyer 
or nielstrom and manzicki 
logan and krause 
i will not have this discussion
with you 
you don t wanna hear the answer 
don t ask the question 
and you  you fucking snitch 
did you ever think about shark
putting food on the table 
you lied to him 
you didn t give him a choice 
  it s a doctor s ethics 
  since when 
the hippocratic oath  that s when 
the one that starts    do no harm   
with all due respect  i didn t
have to ask because i knew the answer 
who am i to tell these men
they cannot live their dream 
they will not live with shame like you 
they are gladiators 
they are warriors 
and long ago  they made that choice 
not you  not you 
not me  i won t be responsible
for standing between them  
didn t you ever have   
   a dream  ollie 
i m living it  harv 
oh  fuck it

i know  man  i just got happy feet 
i m getting old 
i should just trust that you ll
do the right thing for willie b 
is it true you make 10 million a year 
that s right 
it must be true about you
not blocking no more either 
my dad says you won t take passes up
the middle because you might get hurt 
what s that 
you led  nigger 
but did anybody follow 
let me tell you something  
for every sucker who makes it   
   for every barry sanders 
for every jerry rice   
   there s a hundred niggers
you never heard of 
sure  the game s taught you
how to strut   
   how to talk shit  how to hit 
but what else 
suddenly  there s no more money   
   no more women  no more applause 
no more dream 
this is what i m trying to say to you 
when a man   
   looks back on his life 
he should be proud of all of it 
not just the years he spent
in pads and cleats 
not just memories of   
   when he was great 
you gotta learn that in here 
or if you don t  you ain t a man 
you re just another punk 
who wants mustard on their hot dog 
johnny 
  no  just ketchup

ketchup  mustard  mustard

i just think that it s time for me   
   to get out after this season 
and do what 
i talked to a guy
at one of the networks  
you are a football player 
will you hear me out 
you re a football player  jack 
and you have two or three years
left in you 
cindy  you are missing
the big picture here 
there is no big picture here  jack 
you re the goddamn quarterback
for the miami sharks 
you re a legend 
and you re talking about quitting 
all my life everybody s been telling me
what to do  ever since college 
this is not your decision 
it is my decision   
i will not listen
to this bullshit from you 
i will not 
wanna know why 
because they want you 
you know what i m saying 
the sky s the limit  baby 
they ll swallow
the beer distributorship 
the funny thing about this
whole situation is   
   no one knows how good
you really are 
you get in that playoff game 
you score   
   you can forget about this team 
they ll lose anyway 
  i m bored 
  can you give me a second 
you ll get five million
serious dollars from somebody 
i m gonna tell you something else 
christina wants to give you  2 million
to extend you for the year 
but we re gonna wait 
that s what you hired me for 
to watch your back 
you follow me 
i hope you re doing that  wayne 
just in case i ain t made out of steel 
i m saying  what if
my arm starts hurting 
where you coming from with that 
baby  ain t nothing

vanessa 
  vanessa   
excuse me 
hey  that s willie beamen 
how you been  long time 
congratulations 
  things are cool 
  getting what you wanted 
i blew it  v 
everything was just happening so fast 
i didn t have time to think 
i was thinking maybe we could go out 
we could just get together 
i don t think so  willie  i m sorry 
i understand  or do i 
you re just too volatile for me 
i m a simple girl 
i like simple things 
truth be told  i didn t even
like football  i liked you 
i m sorry 
  i understand  
  willie  no 
  get out of here 
  i need to talk to you 
oh  my goodness  barbara bush 
  where you been all my life 
  i m sorry 
you re looking good too 
there s that smile

listen to me  i just need to know

  you too shy 
  no  i m not shy 
i got a date out there 
you re talking about
the mortician out there 
you re just jealous because he s tall 
but he can t ball 
i ll holler 
congratulations 
was i the last to know 
cindy rooney told me 
what the hell are you doing
starting cap 
throwing him against the best
pass rush in the league 
cap s my starter 
  if we lose this game  
  i ll do you one better 
in the off season  i m trading willie 
that s not your option 
your kid may sell a lot of t shirts 
but he is tearing this team apart 
  then hold it together 
  i can t  not with him 
where are you going 
you will start willie on sunday   
   and you ll make the adjustment
to modern times 
you don t tell me what to do 
nobody tells me what to do 
your father never told me what to do 
you re not gonna start 
i d cut my father s ass
if we were losing like this 
you know  i m really getting
sick and tired of you 
your father was no genius 
he only acted like he was one 
and he took credit for a lot of things
he never did 
he at least respected me 
would you stop using my father
as a scapegoat 
i can t even imagine what he d think
of you right now   
   but my hunch is  he d be ashamed 
he d be ashamed 
why do you think he put me in charge 
you bullheaded moron 
he could ve made you general manager 
but he didn t  did he 
you know why 
because he knew you didn t have the guts
to do it after he was gone 
it s true  tony 
he couldn t trust you 
you got old 
i ll be in my father s office 
  christina will destroy this team 
  what is it you fear 
you ve got so much fear
inside of you  tony 
i m losing the team  maggie 
i m losing control 
everything in my life s about control 
i lead men 
i control 
did art think i was past it 
i don t know 
do you care 
you never understood artie 
did you 
he wanted a son   
   more than anything else
in the world 
and when you really think about it 
what christina is   
   it s just such a tragedy 
you know  she will sell the team 
and everything her father
stood for is gonna die 
and what will you do  tony 
after football   
   with nobody to control 
stop it  what are you doing 
hey  i blame you for a lot of things 
you were like artie 
a monster 
you ve gotten older  better 
but for a long time i hated you 
that game took my husband 
my daughter   
   my youth 
left me with what 
all those sunday afternoons
at the stadium 
and time   
   just kept slipping away  didn t it 
how s your head  jack 
sandy  it s nice of you to ask 
it s still hurting  quite frankly 
like you guys  i play hurt 
look at the monitor  you ll see
it was more than aggression 
out of my way 
well  that s just great 
there goes d amato  his 14th
consecutive game with a touchdown 
we regret to inform you that your
husband  lieutenant louis d amato   
   was killed in the european
theater of operations 
and to your son  anthony d amato   
   our deepest regrets 
controversy swirls around
the six point shark underdogs 
willie   steamin    beamen 
the sensational quarterback   
   who s held the sharks together 
is not starting 
he s said to be feuding
with his beleaguered coach   
   who s being investigated
for hitting jack rose   
   earlier this week at practice 
i d say that s
a bit of an exaggeration 
  a mild shove 
  we ll find out later 
i m the best yard receiver
that s ever lived 
i can catch anything 
i m the best receiver
that s ever lived 
that s right 
meanwhile  tug 
immortal but vulnerable cap rooney   
   only six weeks off
a microdiskectomy  
  will start against
the league s toughest pass rush 
    toughest   
  the toughest 
get ready for the sparks to fly 
we ll be right back 
  the tension of the season
got to me   
   and i overreacted to an innocent
question from a journalist   
   we all know to be
of the highest caliber 
i only hope that one day i ll truly
be able to show jack rose   
   just how much i treasure
his invaluable contribution   
   to the sport of football   
thank you 
where s your wheelchair 
hello  commissioner 
god  i hate texas 
how are the headaches 
fine  till you start doing that shit 
your balance 
my check balance 
looking p h a t  baby  phat 
go on  get out of here 
you re done 
how about another shot  doc 
you don t need it 
it doesn t make any sense   
   medically 
don t give a shit about medical  doc 
give me some of that cortisone shit 
please 
the surviving team will move on
next week to minnesota   
   cold country for the
affa conference championship 
in the meantime 
we re back to another dang commercial 
i don t know what to say  really 
three minutes   
   till the biggest battle
of our professional lives 
all comes down to today 
either we heal as a team   
   or we re gonna crumble 
inch by inch  play by play 
till we re finished 
we re in hell right now  gentlemen 
believe me 
and we can stay here 
get the shit kicked out of us   
   or we can fight our way
back into the light 
we can climb out of hell   
   one inch at a time 
now  i can t do it for you 
i m too old 
i look around  i see these
young faces  and i think   
   i made every wrong choice
a middle aged man can make 
i pissed away all my money 
believe it or not 
i chased off anyone
who s ever loved me 
and lately  i can t even stand
the face i see in the mirror 
you know  when you get old in life 
things get taken from you 
i mean  that s part of life 
but you only learn that
when you start losing stuff 
you find out life s this game
of inches 
so is football 
because in either game 
life or football   
   the margin for error is so small   
   one half a step too late or early 
and you don t quite make it 
one half second too slow  too fast 
you don t quite catch it 
the inches we need are
everywhere around us 
they re in every break of the game 
every minute  every second 
on this team  we fight for that inch 
on this team  we tear ourselves   
   and everyone else around us 
to pieces for that inch 
we claw with our fingernails
for that inch   
   because we know when we add up
all those inches   
   that s gonna make the fucking
difference between winning and losing 
between living and dying 
i ll tell you this  in any fight   
   it s the guy who s willing to die
who s gonna win that inch 
and i know if i m gonna have
any life anymore   
   it s because i m still willing
to fight and die for that inch 
because that s what living is 
the six inches in front of your face 
now  i can t make you do it 
you gotta look at the guy
next to you 
look into his eyes 
i think you re gonna see a guy
who ll go that inch with you 
you re gonna see a guy   
   who will sacrifice himself
for this team   
   because he knows 
when it comes down to it   
   you re gonna do the same for him 
that s a team  gentlemen 
and either we heal now  as a team   
   or we will die as individuals 
that s football  guys 
that s all it is 
now   
   what are you gonna do 
here we go  ladies and gentlemen 
he s in the open field 
he s gonna go all the way 
to the thirty  all the way 
touchdown 
  way to go 
  no big deal 
we still block and tackle 
we didn t say we d win by a shutout 
nothing changes  right 
stay with the game plan 
  set for the first series 
  piece of cake 
bring it home  rock 
how about a big texas size welcome
for the miami sharks   
   and quarterback jack rooney 
my baby 
guys  i missed your ugly mugs 
just like old times 
your disk still spinning 
like your favorite cd  baby 
listen up 
it s a 12 point game for dallas 
what  it s just one touchdown 
in your hometown 
a long way to go 
a lot of time to play 
there he goes  sack number 12 
that s a personal high
for luther lavay 
man  i can t believe this 
it stinks 
we re the better team  we ll win
if we don t make any mistakes 
inches  inches 
let me on the finance committee  i ll
make a difference with the networks 
i know new york 
i can be incredibly effective 
your mother looks great  by the way 
  she loves dallas  neiman marcus 
  she s a good woman 
and your golf

  think you re ready for me 
  don t think i m in your class 
first down  dallas 
it s a good game 
good team 
thank you 
i don t wanna bother you about this  
the owners would like you to
come to new york for a meeting 
about what 
there s a concern
that s been voiced   
   about some moves made
on your behalf   
   for another los angeles franchise 
  rules have been broken  we ve heard  
  who said this 
would wednesday this week be too soon 
no  that d be fine 
good 
the best of luck to you today  then 
i honestly believe that woman
would eat her young 
what the fuck just happened 
that s the meaning
in one sentence   
   of captain jack rooney 
he won t take no for an answer 
good job  cap 
good job  baby 
they can t fuck with you 
score at halftime 
knights 2 1  sharks 17

look at me  rock 
you were a warrior out there today 
i will never forget this 
go do your job  coach 
this isn t about you and me anymore 
you gotta lead this team 
when they look in your eyes   
   they gotta believe 
i know 
what do you think you re doing 
cap is finished 
never talk that way
in front of my players 
get out of here 
i don t give a shit if willie
is out there changing the plays 
you let your ego get in the way
of this team   
   and you ll lose
this fucking game 
get out of here  
i m sorry  but coach d 
already told me i was going in 
control the line of scrimmage 
you ll control this game 
possession of the ball 
that s all i want  move those chains 
read the safety s drop 
if he backpedals  then we go downtown 
surprise them  make it sudden 
if you see their arms shaking 
that means they re coming 
control the line of scrimmage 
you control the game 
you said that already 
one more thing  right out of the gate 
let it fly  go 999 
shock the shit out of them 
interception 
what a way to start
this second half 
he s down at the 48 yard line 
that s a tough break for this kid 
his first time in the playoffs 
he s gotta be feeling the pressure 
branco s just aching to nail you 
watch his knuckles 
if they go white  do a fade to sandman 
you want me to check off 
where s the coach i knew and loved 
if branco bites 
first down 
looks like he had damage to his eye 
on the four 
twist it  twist it 
here we go 
strong left zig 90 gun on three 
i m serious  it s coach d  s call 
by the way   
   i m sorry about getting a big head 
it wasn t me 
it was the devil  red 666 
let s get them
before they know what hit them 
on three  ready 
watch the robber on your right 
he ll be coming at you 
touchdown  miami 
i m good 
this one right there 
touchdown 
if you hit him for another score
in the next series  he ll fold 
i know it 
touchdown  miami 
that s what i m talking about  baby 
depending on how the election goes    
we got six producing wells probably
pumping out about    
your home base is in dallas 
the thing that bothers me most   
   is if you don t have 30 000
in attendance    
coach  it s fourth and one 
we need a time out 
all right  shark  let s go 
run the three man 
looks like dallas is going for it 
he is going for the victory now 
not a tie 
here we go now  one time 
this is the game  tug 
if miami can hold them here   
   willie beamen will have
one last chance 
this is where the famous rubber   
   meets the famous road 
settle down  be proud 
guys  y all gonna make this play 
one yard stands between us
and minnesota 
they got no respect for us 
shark flat on his ass 
everything we ever fought for
is on the line right now 
be proud 
strong right  strong right 
is it first 
sharks  ball  first down 
looks like a man s down
at the line of scrimmage 
luther   shark   lavay 
he s been the heart
and soul of this defense 
let s hope he s okay 
stabilize his head 
can you hear me   check his hands 
we got a pulse 
i don t know  coach 
what does that mean 
is he breathing 
ambulance 
talk to me  shark  come on 
let s get that board over here

coach

look at that 
major bonus  baby  one million bucks

i learned more watching him in the
first half than i did in five seasons 
next week i ll win it
just for him 
glad to see success hasn t
gone to your head too much  kid 
who  me  steamin  beamen 
this is your moment  willie 
savor it 
but never forget  on any given sunday 
you re either gonna win or lose 
  but can you win or lose like a man   
i got it  coach 
next year   
   i m out of here 
i figured 
i m not the right guy
for this team anymore 
i wouldn t say all that 
there was this great quarterback
in the  70s i knew 
i mean  this guy was one tough
son of a bitch 
he fought for every inch he ever got 
he didn t have your natural skills 
but he could make it happen 
he could win 
but the game passed him by 
anyway  i ran into this guy   
   a few weeks ago in l a 
we had a few beers  and we start
talking  you know what he told me 
he said when he looked back   
   he didn t really miss
the pantheon cups   
   or the girls   
   or even the glory 
you know what he missed 
what he missed were those other guys
looking back at him in the huddle 
those eleven guys   
   every one of them seeing things
the same way 
all of them looking downfield   
   together 
that s what he missed 
i m gonna miss you  amigo 
you know  my arm has been killing me 
i met with a specialist who said  
i m scared 
we re all scared 
if you think it s easy being a coach 
i ll trade your microphone for my ulcer 
i m a triple decker
stress sandwich right now 
why is that  coach 
the 32 13 loss to san francisco 
you re not even close  johnny 
try fishing someplace else 
and i want to live up to what it is
my father left me 
a legacy 
a feeling of a bond with this town 
a feeling that this is our house 
the pagniacci house 
and we have great confidence   
   that in the final hour 
our mayor will be there for us 
and tony    
know this 
wherever you go  you will always be   
   loved and greatly respected 
thank you 
thanks for helping me understand again
what i had forgotten 
tony d  
he s been here 30 years 
even the dogs are sad  he said 
it s been way too long
not to win a big one 
san francisco sure
took care of that for us 
in football  as in life  things change 
i guess it s time for me to get the
hell out of the way  bring in the new 
i like nick crozier 
i think he ll do a great job 
but most of all i want to thank
the people of miami   
   for their support through
the last 20 some odd years 
gee  it just flew by 
it s really meant a lot to me 
it meant everything to me 
i ve had a great  great ride 
believe me  and    
and i m gonna miss you 
he s an arrogant son of a bitch 
but i ll miss him 
in thinking about change   
   i don t know  i felt maybe it was
time for me to make a change too 
and it was willie beamen taught me
how to give it another shot 
so starting today   
   i m taking over as head coach   
   for that new expansion team in
albuquerque  new mexico  the aztecs 
  why    do you say  because they re
giving me full management control 
but hoping not to make a complete fool
of myself out there   
   i just signed willie beamen
as my starting quarterback   
   and franchise player for the aztecs 
so  miss p  i look forward to seeing you
