keep your head on a swivel
slide out there pick up that robber
roll up those outside linebackers

sanderson and fox
will break off their routes
but you gotta be there and deliver
two turnovers in one half
defense
this is what we gotta do here
i dont know
you gotta do something out there
you gotta make it happen
you gotta stop flying around the ball
tackle somebody
dont let these guys
chew up the clock on us
when we put eight in a box
you gotta jam those receivers
if you make mistakes make them big
i wont eat your lunch for that
here we got pj
mac beastman horny shark
onetwo yards less each time
theyll be looking at second and 8
instead of second and 6
were only down by 3

im doing my best
turn up the volume
red beats read
theyre giving us the flat
lets run smoke and throw
theyre looking for the pick
im not taking any chances

third down and five
theyre screaming for him to dump it
its wide open
i know this coach hes a prick
this is a setup ive seen this
well run it again
lets do it
lets do deuce left 22
run the same play
all the sharks have to do
is hold on to the ball
its money time give me five
we home and dry and flying high
let the d win it jman
we dont need no first down
thats why you dont score
with the ladies
same play same play
on two
call timeout theyre stacked up
against the run
timeouts for tv negative
fumble
he fumbled
loose ball minnesotas got it
how stupid how selfish
julian washington fumbles the ball
in your face
you wonder if the milliondollar
bonus when he reaches 1500 yards
didnt play into that one
thats right kev and now damatos
lost four games in a row
two hands
with two hands you showboat
honey please dont feel too bad
we lost once
all of a sudden
one of these real tall gentlemen
jumped up so high

he died because of this
i dont want you to take anything
so seriously honey
its just a game honey
good night mother
good night darling
at least the dog still loves her

lets take a knee father
you and i have been in some tough
places together havent we
i went to my playbook
and the book says the rain falls
on the just and the unjust alike
now we just lost four in a row
that doesnt mean
that were specially cursed
joy comes in the morning
there are no atheists in foxholes
lets pray
our father who art in heaven
how you doing rock
i felt like i was gonna die
they went in and they sucked out
my l5 disk
its no big deal

ill fight for you till the day i die
willie beamen i dont believe you
your first big game on tv
and you didnt let your own mama know
here it is right here
not that willie didnt have some
nauseating moments of his own
poor guy
are you gonna start
you could at least play firststring
no probably not
lets hope willie beamen
brings his tums with him
you should be starting
mom im number three
there aint nothing
i can do about it
youve been at this for 5 years
tell everybody i said i love them
and ill see them
i love you too willie
i love you
baby she just wants the best for you
yeah i know she does
you did great
you gotta wonder why damato
would call that play
when jman likes to pick his spot
when he runs
calling the same play twice
whats that about
theres a reason this teams
lost four games in a row
forget about the offensive line
and forget about cap rooney
forget about the moneygrubbing
christina pagniacci
hello genius
this guy started coaching
in the late 60s for gods sake
im glad hes not talking about me
here you go coach
thank you
this is a team with more than 200
variations on the pass
napoleon damatos playbooks
got less than 75 plays total
200 variations on a pass
whats wrong with this picture
youre that coach right
im mandy mandy murphy
you look better in real life
youre always yelling at people on tv
at least i look better
than that old fart up there no
i think
you do
how old are you
i dont think age matters
i think older guys have a certain thing
ive wanted to meet you since i was 16
you were on the sidelines
you were winning this big game
the pantheon cup yeah
that was it
god thats so wild
so you promise to keep a secret
i dont know how do you mean
on a date
i got a place
its close by its quiet
its a thousand
five thousand for the night
you wont regret it
im flattered thank you but
i got friends
i could do your friends too
some other time maybe
fair enough
good luck
ill be rooting for you
thank you
coach
i know youre not gonna
pass on that damato
i must be drunk
christina pagniacci
whos so smart
she sold three of last years
starters in the offseason
you think you can lose
your coaching instincts
you never had them
how you gonna lose them
all i got are my instincts
i lose those i got nothing
please leave your name and message
and well get right back to you
have a nice day byebye
so jeanette
i was hoping youd be awake
what time is it out there anyway
never mind
could you tell tommy that ill be
in la in a couple of weeks
we got a game
id like to get together with him
but i dont have his new number
i really miss the shit out of
little timmy and melinda
and you
grandkids
we got grandkids
why did we get divorced anyway
fuck
if youd like to make a call
please hang up and try again
shit
were gonna make a difference
this week
just the tip of the ball catch it
this aint no bullshit west virginia
you in the big leagues
what the fuck is that what are you
a pussy that aint no damn hit
14 years i know how to hit
14 years youre captain
show me
break that shit up
goddamn it baby you did it
thats my boy my brotherfucker
thats the way to hit it shark
that is the way to hit it
now come on in here
let me get this straight
the california governor says theres
nothing for the public to vote on
shes got the finances to build
a new stadium in los angeles
using lottery money
jeez ed
las a dream
certainly good enough to leverage the
city of miami into a new stadium
what about the rosenthal bid
250 million
its so low
with a new stadium and a winning team
this club is worth 800 million
its me
youre like your dad
youre a dreamer
take the money
youre still young darling
start over start a family
you dont love football anyway
its none of your business ed
lets keep this between the three of us
morning tony
morning christina
alkaseltzer
no thank you
i had about four for breakfast
this is a hell of a loss tony
i can see how my mom could drink herself
into a stupor watching football games
but this kind of play makes me
want to jump out of a window
well you can run this a billion times
but on any given sunday
youll either win or youll lose
the point is can you win or lose
like a man  dad said lots of things
actually i said that
but he could never stand losing
and julian couldnt resist
going for his bonus yards
blame me not julian
that was my call
i know it was tony
its four in a row
this season is a disaster
without the playoffs
theres no more tv money
you see this
they want your head
your father would laugh at them
this is a good team
we hit we win
we put pressure we win
we penetrate we win you do it as
tough as it is possible to do
and you do that in all things
you die hard
thats what im talking about
you die hard
dad used to say
no intensity no victory
where the hell is your intensity
tony
four years ago
we won the pantheon cup
i was there remember
now what are we
were a secondtier team thats what
admit it youre not being honest
were a solid football team
were just not inspired
too many free agents
we got julian hes a merc
end of the season hes gone
next year we rebuild our running game
you talk about a running game but
who cares as long as youre winning
people want to see passes touchdowns
high scores thats the game today
i paid a lot of money
to get nick crozier here
specifically to modernize
footballs played on a field
not in the goddamn boxes
you knew that when you had candy
stuck in your braces
if we had gotten the linemen i wanted
our first two quarterbacks
would still be walking
think of the future
do you know what we could get for cap
probably a second
and a thirddraft choice
we know that hes finished but
i dont know that cap is finished
do i have to remind you
that he helped build this franchise
hes a hero to the working people
of florida
probably one of the greatest pressure
players of all time
you cant cut cap
cap and shark were great
but memories
shark changed linebacking forever
he made a quantum leap in the game
thats why well say goodbye
to both of them
with dignity with class
i wont cut cap or shark no matter
how much class you do it with
my contracts very clear on this point
i coach my way
we make less money
than 90 of the other teams
the economics
fuck the economics
your father you hear me your father
didnt interfere he made it work
thats because you were a fighter
you had intensity
as much as i respect
my famous uncle tony
the players are just not
responding to you
art may he rest in peace
spent money like water
but in the modern game
with the marketing costs
listen i will do anything to bring
this team back to greatness
i guess i had nothing to do with that
that was all your dad
am i excused now
jeez whos playing the child now
everybodys got to renegotiate
and that means you too
are you saying my contracts up
at the end of the season
the economics arent there
that what youre saying
you know youre not giving me
a whole lot to work with
you know how your dad and i negotiated
my contract we had a beer
we shook hands
well i dont drink beer tony
i dont imagine you do no
fucking beer

300pound blocker

because he sure cant run like i can
jmans got a point
beamen aint doing his homework
he wont read the playbook
he wont come see the films
he doesnt even know the names
of the defense hes facing
he dont give
a geewhiz about anybody
he just wants
to make the plays himself
hes young cap
he doesnt know how to read like you
what do you mean hes young
come on he just does what he likes
hes changing the plays in the huddle
plays that you designed that i love
hes dissing this play and dissing
that play  i got a better play
guys we won
whats the point
im trying to get paid
thats the point
the point is if we dont win
you cant do your commercials

anything else
hey guess what
coach suddenly invited me

his eyehand coordinations

hes fucked up the crazier they are
the more the crowd likes it
this isnt pro wrestling
he needs an mri
you gonna order a 20000 workup
for every nutcase on this team
could have a subdural hematoma
intracranial bleeding
or he could just be
a crazy fucker okay
they walk on that field every sunday
they got only one thing going for them
their confidence
you chip away at that
with a bunch of unnecessary testing
and we can kiss
the playoffs goodbye

i cant do the tests on shark
jesus christ

i have earned their trust
you havent good night

i said  im as tight as fish pussy
i need an interpreter
okay cap sit down

lets go
bottom line rooney is like
some kind of medical miracle
he really could be ready for new york
have you told anyone
ive been on for 12 years
and two rings
give me a break i played hurt before
its no big deal
hes so freaked about beamen taking his
job hed play with a fractured neck
could you slow him down
tell him hes not responding
to rehab well enough
lets give beamen a shot
were going with willie
against new york
rest up till the playoffs
the emperors dont mean enough for you
to risk everything
homefield advantage
that dont mean anything
everyone knows
herniated discs are iffy
this is how it starts huh
i know what youre talking about
i know how your mind works
rest up
let the kid take a few games
you were great but time marches on
thats not what im saying
the heck youre not
i know the game of football
what about shark
hes woozy still
hes got bad migraines
postconcussive syndrome
dont get a hardon dont move
can you clear him
hes had 3 concussions in 5 months
theres no way to predict what
another head hit would do
i dont think anythingll happen
but im not a complete prick
i do have a conscience
im not trying to screw him harvey
but id like him in the playoffs
longterm what are you thinking
what am i thinking
bottom line
well cut him in the offseason
the words out
everyones seen him take the hits
nobodys gonna sign a
twomilliondollar concussion case
hell be happy to have his job back
at 30 of what he makes
thats if we want him back
hes got four kids christina
you do the math doctor
what you help save us now
we wont forget at contract time
what do i tell tony
tell him what he needs to know
shark can play cap cant
in these high beautiful heels
you know what you need
a pump
you need to be
young again
you got me
i like going downfield
thats my game i open it wide open
the fans want it oldtimers
dont dig it like coach stone age
i beg your pardon  coach stone age
is that what you just said
its up and its good baby
thats a name i give him
i dont mean disrespect
tell me about your past
where did you start
in houston but the coach didnt dig
having a black quarterback
i guess he felt our brains
was no bigger than the tip of his
and then i went to san diego
coach made me cornerback
because he felt i had quick feet
no wait leave him on hes cool
cool
thinks hes joe montana already
they didnt know what i was
i mean he doesnt buy into the
bullshit you know i like his eyes
life aint fair
and fair aint what im here for
hes sure of himself
it makes him sexy
im glad im old
check all right
im not surprised rookie thinks hes
hot shit and allpro all of a sudden
did you feed the dogs
put the kids to bed
cant we afford a maid
whyd i get married
are you saying black people
are being dissed in this league
i see what youre doing
youre doing that media spin
lets talk about the facts
70 of the league is africanamerican
how many black coaches do you have
very few
how many black owners
none
zero
at what point does the  uncle tom
feel come into it not my language
it is because we didnt speak it
when we got here
but  coach stone age
your smack is so fresh so on time
and truthful give me a pound dog
share the love
ill pass on the love
you get it started okay
hope you like cream in your coffee
yes i do
mandy
i like you
im wondering
maybe we could make this
you know a more regular thing
yeah i got a few clients like that
we could book a regular time
ill give you my number
no i sort of meant
not like that
without the money
i know but
no you dont want to do this
i really like you
i like you too
tony you dont want to do this
call me
you got pretty hair
got you flowers
these for me
thank you
carnations
ill put them in water or something
come on in
want a beer
yeah
sharky motherfucker
nice spot
yeah isnt it
the gladiators of their time
thats what its all about
i dont cook so well
but you gotta try this jambalaya
ready
im always ready
it was my recipe sort of
how do you like it
itshot
lets talk about some basics
you getting ready to yell at me
cap going down was tough on me
i realize youre learning the system
pressure must be incredible
i can handle it
i know you can
if the playbook is too complicated
we simplify it
playbooks too slow
when im on the field
i gotta feel it gotta let it out
that why youve been changing the plays
im just trying to read the defense
im not talking about audibles
talking about in the huddle
when you change plays
you show disrespect to people
people who have worked years
in this club
people whove sacrificed more than
youll ever know to be in this game
im trying to win coach
i aint trying to disrespect nobody
winning is the only thing i respect
listen very carefully
one day youll realize this is
the truest thing you ever heard
this game
this game has got to be
about more than winning
youre part of something
lombardi tittle sammy baugh unitas
those men on the wall
youre part of that now
i want you to cherish it
because when its gone
its gone forever
when i look at them pictures
and trophies it just makes me sad
its like a room full of ghosts
when im done with this game
i dont want to be no ghost
i wanna be more than that
looks like caps gonna make it
back in time for the playoffs
what
im gonna start him
i knew you were gonna sell me out
caps a leader hes a team player
thats such bullshit
he aint half the athlete i am
you look me in the eye and tell me
that cap is a better player
caps a better player
i guess somebody else
won them last two games
he lost four in a row
i lead by doing
you kicked ass
but cap rooney has been doing it
for years
and his time is over
and yours is too
unless you take some risk
play this game the way
its played today
its not about
the pictures on the wall
ive lived this game
for three decades kid
i know football
those men on the wall
they wanted to win
just like you do
you can feed the press that whole
sacrifice and gloryofthegame crap
but i been there
i seen a long line of coaches
with that same old bullshit
halftime speech
bullshit
yes its bullshit
you know its bullshit
because its about the money
the tv contracts
fatcat boosters in the skyboxes
coaches trying to up their salaries
you looking for the next black stud
to take it to the top 10
get you in a bowl game
its the same way in the pros
except in the pros
the field hands get paid
dont play that race card on me kid
25 years i work with men
of your color
maybe its not racism
maybe its placism
brother has to know his place
right boss
i dont understand
what youre talking about
you dont trust anybody
because of what happened in college
you knew the rules
you were the one that broke them
how did i break them
how
i lost a milliondollar
signing bonus
because i took a 300 suit
from a booster to go to a wedding
whats a brother supposed to do
in college he aint got money
he wants to go out on a date
wants to get some nice clothes
everybody had their hands out
but it was me they suspended
i dropped six rounds in the draft
because of that
the coaches labeled me  hes trouble
he dont wanna play ball
you talk about sacrifice
i sacrificed  10 million because dumb
rednecks like the coach in san diego
made me a cornerback
because i got quick feet
he separated my shoulder tackling
250pound motherfuckers
i dont do that
i was a great football player
but nobody let my shoulder heal
and they traded me out of there
you go ahead
blame everybody but yourself
whatever
because thats what a leaders about
sacrifice
the times hes gotta sacrifice
because hes gotta lead by example
not by fear and not by selfpity
who you think youre talking to
half my career is over
and you want me on the bench
to sacrifice for the glory
of cap rooney fuck you
i aint buying your brand
just because you some scared old man
you feel like if i play my way
i just might win
then what was your life about anyway
youre not some flashinthepan
corner or receiver
or even julian washington
youre a goddamn quarterback
you know what that means
its the top spot kid
its the guy takes the fall
its the guy everybodys looking at
first the leader of a team
who will support you
when they understand you
who will break their ribs and their
noses and their necks for you
because they believe
because you make them believe
thats a quarterback
im the leader of your team
till caps back up
then im back on the bench
you aint said two words to me
till cherubini went down
then it was  go out there and
play like youre in the hood
youre throwing the ball
and your mamas
ringing the dinner bell
all you do is talk at me man
im gonna stay who i am
steamin willie beamen
with the time i got left
ill play my way get my dollars up
so when you go to waive me trade me
or whatever the fuck yall do
ill be worth 10 times what
i was worth before i got here
youre very very young
and youre very very stupid
whatre you doing get off the lawn
its mr beamen willie how you doing
its about winning thats what this
countrys about being number one
this whole country was built
on kicking immigrant ass
african ass chinese ass
dont matter who ass
get the fuck out
get the fuck out of here bitch
every kid can grow up
to be president right
who the hell want to grow up
and be vice president
there aint no number twos
in football

the vince lombardi speech

i worked harder than anybody else
you make it and get the big car
or you dont and catch the bus
and you in the funeral home
because to me losing is dying
losing is dying

saying that hell kick your ass
like i give a fuck
im trying to win some games
i aint trying to kiss
no overrated losers ass
what you care about
you playing for yourself
what you talking about punk
you gotta earn the right
to diss somebody on this team
you call this a team
i see a bunch of superfly
brothers running around
living in the white mans world
getting their dicks sucked by hos
j you were a great football player
now you done turn into a joke
youre playing
but youre dying inside
what the fuck you mean
im dying inside
kiss my armani ass know what i did for
this team ill take your life man
football is a corporation
black kids are raised
to be stars individuals
they do not learn to work together
beamens talking shit about you
what
talking about how wed be on top
if the defense would do their job
fucking kidding me
motherfucker ill break a piece
off in his goddamn ass
what the fuck is wrong with you
motherfucker
in football you have
the offense and the defense
you cant have one without the other
respect will be paid
somebody call you a cab
get out of my house
but isnt this an awesome new york
pass rush coming at you
when youre out there
is the fear in the belly
the fear and the terror
no i dont feel none of that
they wont touch me they wont
feel me they wont even smell me
i dont care if its the trex
or the terminator chasing me
i got this invisible juice
once i turn it on im gone
stay down motherfucker
beamen is sacked again
he goes down hard
they wont play for him tony
let him fucking learn then
welcome back
to the monsoon bowl folks
the emperors have been eating
shark patties all night long
smashmouth football
this is what its all about
halfback up the middle
lavay steps up to fill the gap
misses the tackle
the emperors block their way
into the end zone its a touchdown
good job offense way to play
just about everything that can
go wrong has here today
murphys law in effect
for tony damato
can i get some fucking protection
if youre not blocking
get the fuck out the way
loudmouth showboat motherfucker
wheres your steam now willie
you fuckers wanna make it tough
i can take that shit
come contract time
therell be a whole bunch of changes
just give us the play
itll be you or me
and it aint gonna be me
and there goes homefield advantage
for the sharks
although their season ends on a low
note theres still life after death
look for them in the playoffs
in tough town u sa
dallas texas
there goes that black dynasty
you promised me darling
whats the matter
forgot your invisible juice
stop this now
thirty years in football
i never seen something
stinks like this
today out there
you embarrassed yourselves
today
im ashamed to be your coach
lucky for him some of these sharks
still have teeth left in their head
tell you the truth
they remind me of my ex
i dont know what more i can do
doesnt make sense
my not having a home a life
games all that matters to me
because its pure
four quarters
you cross a line you score
its sane life isnt
life is fucked
its a new world tony
in my day we used to just be happy
to get the goddamn job
i used to shovel liquor
in the offseason
you know sell used cars insurance
some of the guys used to even wrestle
but shit now prima dogs
bodies that are yearround great
but crack just like china
its tv
changed everything
changed the way we think forever
i mean the first time
they stopped the game
to cut away to a fucking commercial
that was the end of it
because it was our concentration
that mattered not theirs
not some fruitcake selling cereal
who wants to think about blitzes
when youre holding your grandkids
you gonna miss your friend
screaming in your face
embarrassing you
in front of your players
thats why i wanna coach high school
get back to the basics
kids dont know nothing
they just wanna play
like you said tony
its pure
so what are the odds
well theres no telling
its an odontoid fracture
basically luther you broke your neck
and it never healed correctly
its hard to predict
this kind of thing
but what i can say is
that the wrong kind of hit
could result
in paralysis seizures
even sudden death
what else is new
in my opinion
he is not medically fit to play
i need one sack
and three more tackles
and i get my bonus then well talk
okay motherfucker
come on luther
have you ever seen
an old punchdrunk boxer
stumbling around drooling
with no memory of
what hes done in his life
you want that life luther
you need me against texas dont you
dont you
of course i need you against texas
but not
not at this price no
for a million dollars i will shake
like a coconut on a tree if i got to
coach i gave you 13 years
you can give me one
footballs my life coach
its my life
its all i know how to do
please man
come on coach please
you have to sign a waiver shark
bring it on man bring it on
coach
we need to have
a discussion about harvey
where the hells damato
dont you ever say that
your papa didnt believe in you
dont believe what your mom says
you evil motherfucker
come over here
sharks film
i know what you did asshole
you switched the results
so powers wouldnt pick up on it
princess ill call you right back
granted it could look that way
to a layperson
i want you out of here
youre taking the high road
you didnt consult with him
he could get killed out there
you didnt consult with him
im gonna consult with a player
i knew his answer
getting killed maybe maybe not
one chance in 1000
but nobody blitzes
like the shark right
i never wanna see you near
one of my players again
they couldnt take a piss
in the morning without their pills
youre gonna play innocent
fuck your innocence
what about beyer
or nielstrom and manzicki
logan and krause
i will not have this discussion
with you
you dont wanna hear the answer
dont ask the question
and you you fucking snitch
did you ever think about shark
putting food on the table
you lied to him
you didnt give him a choice
its a doctors ethics
since when
the hippocratic oath thats when
the one that starts  do no harm
with all due respect i didnt
have to ask because i knew the answer
who am i to tell these men
they cannot live their dream
they will not live with shame like you
they are gladiators
they are warriors
and long ago they made that choice
not you not you
not me i wont be responsible
for standing between them
didnt you ever have
a dream ollie
im living it harv
oh fuck it
we did win the pantheon though
didnt we
see you around the old nursing homes
courtney lets go
no im gonna stay here
what

perfect stay here
and get buttfucked by
twelve neanderthals bitch
coach d what do you say
out of my way
well thats just great
thats just fucking great
did you get that
nobodys gonna hit your pussyass
i know man i just got happy feet
im getting old
i should just trust that youll
do the right thing for willie b
is it true you make 10 million a year
thats right
it must be true about you
not blocking no more either
my dad says you wont take passes up
the middle because you might get hurt
whats that
you led nigger
but did anybody follow
let me tell you something
for every sucker who makes it
for every barry sanders
for every jerry rice
theres a hundred niggers
you never heard of
sure the games taught you
how to strut
how to talk shit how to hit
but what else
suddenly theres no more money
no more women no more applause
no more dream
this is what im trying to say to you
when a man
looks back on his life
he should be proud of all of it
not just the years he spent
in pads and cleats
not just memories of
when he was great
you gotta learn that in here
or if you dont you aint a man
youre just another punk

id cut my fathers ass
if we were losing like this
you know im really getting
sick and tired of you
your father was no genius
he only acted like he was one
and he took credit for a lot of things
he never did
he at least respected me
would you stop using my father
as a scapegoat
i cant even imagine what hed think
of you right now
but my hunch is hed be ashamed
hed be ashamed
why do you think he put me in charge
you bullheaded moron
he couldve made you general manager
but he didnt did he
you know why
because he knew you didnt have the guts
to do it after he was gone
its true tony
he couldnt trust you
you got old
ill be in my fathers office
christina will destroy this team
what is it you fear
youve got so much fear
inside of you tony
im losing the team maggie
im losing control
everything in my lifes about control
i lead men
i control
did art think i was past it
i dont know
do you care
you never understood artie
did you
he wanted a son
more than anything else
in the world
and when you really think about it
what christina is
its just such a tragedy
you know she will sell the team
and everything her father
stood for is gonna die
and what will you do tony
after football
with nobody to control
stop it what are you doing
hey i blame you for a lot of things
you were like artie
a monster
youve gotten older better
but for a long time i hated you
that game took my husband
my daughter
my youth
left me with what
all those sunday afternoons
at the stadium
and time
just kept slipping away didnt it
hows your head jack
sandy its nice of you to ask
its still hurting quite frankly
like you guys i play hurt
look at the monitor youll see
it was more than aggression
out of my way
well thats just great
there goes damato his 14th
consecutive game with a touchdown
we regret to inform you that your
husband lieutenant louis damato
was killed in the european
theater of operations
and to your son anthony damato
our deepest regrets
controversy swirls around
the sixpoint shark underdogs
willie  steamin  beamen
the sensational quarterback
whos held the sharks together
is not starting
hes said to be feuding
with his beleaguered coach
whos being investigated
for hitting jack rose
earlier this week at practice
id say thats
a bit of an exaggeration
a mild shove
well find out later
im the best yard receiver
thats ever lived
i can catch anything
im the best receiver
thats ever lived
thats right
meanwhile tug
immortal but vulnerable cap rooney
only six weeks off
a microdiskectomy
will start against
the leagues toughest pass rush
toughest
the toughest
get ready for the sparks to fly
well be right back
the tension of the season
got to me
and i overreacted to an innocent
question from a journalist
we all know to be
of the highest caliber
i only hope that one day ill truly
be able to show jack rose
just how much i treasure
his invaluable contribution
to the sport of football
thank you
wheres your wheelchair
hello commissioner
god i hate texas
how are the headaches
fine till you start doing that shit
your balance
my check balance
looking phat baby phat
go on get out of here
youre done
how about another shot doc
you dont need it
it doesnt make any sense
medically
dont give a shit about medical doc
give me some of that cortisone shit
please
the surviving team will move on
next week to minnesota
cold country for the
affa conference championship
in the meantime
were back to another dang commercial
i dont know what to say really
three minutes
till the biggest battle
of our professional lives
all comes down to today
either we heal as a team
or were gonna crumble
inch by inch play by play
till were finished
were in hell right now gentlemen
believe me
and we can stay here
get the shit kicked out of us
or we can fight our way
back into the light
we can climb out of hell
one inch at a time
now i cant do it for you
im too old
i look around i see these
young faces and i think
i made every wrong choice
a middleaged man can make
i pissed away all my money
believe it or not
i chased off anyone
whos ever loved me
and lately i cant even stand
the face i see in the mirror
you know when you get old in life
things get taken from you
i mean thats part of life
but you only learn that
when you start losing stuff
you find out lifes this game
of inches
so is football
because in either game
life or football
the margin for error is so small
onehalf a step too late or early
and you dont quite make it
one halfsecond too slow too fast
you dont quite catch it
the inches we need are
everywhere around us
theyre in every break of the game
every minute every second
on this team we fight for that inch
on this team we tear ourselves
and everyone else around us
to pieces for that inch
we claw with our fingernails
for that inch
because we know when we add up
all those inches
thats gonna make the fucking
difference between winning and losing
between living and dying
ill tell you this in any fight
its the guy whos willing to die
whos gonna win that inch
and i know if im gonna have
any life anymore
its because im still willing
to fight and die for that inch
because thats what living is
the six inches in front of your face
now i cant make you do it
you gotta look at the guy
next to you
look into his eyes
i think youre gonna see a guy
wholl go that inch with you
youre gonna see a guy
who will sacrifice himself
for this team
because he knows
when it comes down to it
youre gonna do the same for him
thats a team gentlemen
and either we heal now as a team
or we will die as individuals
thats football guys
thats all it is
now
what are you gonna do
here we go ladies and gentlemen
hes in the open field
hes gonna go all the way
to the thirty all the way
touchdown
way to go
no big deal
we still block and tackle
we didnt say wed win by a shutout

nice night

glad to see success hasnt
gone to your head too much kid
who me steamin beamen
this is your moment willie
savor it
but never forget on any given sunday
youre either gonna win or lose
but can you win or lose like a man
i got it coach
next year
im out of here
i figured
im not the right guy
for this team anymore
i wouldnt say all that
there was this great quarterback
in the 70s i knew
i mean this guy was one tough
son of a bitch
he fought for every inch he ever got
he didnt have your natural skills
but he could make it happen
he could win
but the game passed him by
anyway i ran into this guy
a few weeks ago in la
we had a few beers and we start
talking you know what he told me
he said when he looked back
he didnt really miss
the pantheon cups
or the girls
or even the glory
you know what he missed
what he missed were those other guys
looking back at him in the huddle
those eleven guys
every one of them seeing things
the same way
all of them looking downfield
together
thats what he missed
im gonna miss you amigo
you know my arm has been killing me
i met with a specialist who said
im scared
were all scared
if you think its easy being a coach
ill trade your microphone for my ulcer
im a tripledecker
stress sandwich right now
why is that coach
the 3213 loss to san francisco
youre not even close johnny
try fishing someplace else
and i want to live up to what it is
my father left me
a legacy
a feeling of a bond with this town
a feeling that this is our house
the pagniacci house
and we have great confidence
that in the final hour
our mayor will be there for us
and tony
know this
wherever you go you will always be
loved and greatly respected
thank you
thanks for helping me understand again
what i had forgotten
tony d
hes been here 30 years
even the dogs are sad he said
its been way too long
not to win a big one
san francisco sure
took care of that for us
in football as in life things change
i guess its time for me to get the
hell out of the way bring in the new
i like nick crozier
i think hell do a great job
but most of all i want to thank
the people of miami
for their support through
the last 20some odd years
gee it just flew by
its really meant a lot to me
it meant everything to me
ive had a great great ride
believe me and
and im gonna miss you
hes an arrogant son of a bitch
but ill miss him
in thinking about change
i dont know i felt maybe it was
time for me to make a change too
and it was willie beamen taught me
how to give it another shot
so starting today
im taking over as head coach
for that new expansion team in
albuquerque new mexico the aztecs
why  do you say because theyre
giving me full management control
but hoping not to make a complete fool
of myself out there
i just signed willie beamen
as my starting quarterback
and franchise player for the aztecs
so miss p i look forward to seeing you
