at the site of a u f o  crash 
 what 
 and on it are trace elements   
of what we believe
to be alien dna

oh 
so sorry 
an honest mistake 
so  miss channing 
do you have any idea
how alien dna   
ended up on your cigarette 
i might  first of all 
let s talk about what s in this for me 
the safety of this entire planet
may depend on what you say to me 
there s nothing in it for you 
 dr coleye 
may i call you    doctor 
think about it 
when this story breaks 
you will be the most
famous scientist in history 
you will be on the cover
of scientific    whatever 
you will be the man
that proves that aliens exist 
and i will be the woman
who tells the world your story 
we ll do it together 
okay

when they do open 
not after that little stunt
you pulled yesterday 
 we call that breaking and entering 
ah  the smell of moist air 
i ll never forget this 
your ocean 
ice cream 
this primitive planet
may not compare to mars 
but it s not the rotten rock
i thought it was 
don t look now

impossible 
my acute sensory perception   
would have detected that immediately 
now it s working 
hey  hey  buddy

 i m doomed 
 no  no  no  just calm down
