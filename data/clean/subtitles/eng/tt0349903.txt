oh  yeah  my friend rusty 
i m worried about him 
he owns this hotel in los angeles   
   losing a lot of money 
and he s got no life 
he s a nice  bright kid 
but he s beating his brains out 
do you think i could send something
through you  like  a message to him 
i read your palm  not his 
somebody who could do that could do
very well  anything on my heaith 
 my hips are bothering me 
 please 
this  you couldn t see this 
 i tried knocking  he won t open 
 i ll handle it  i know him 
jesus christ  are you people retarded 
 it says   do not disturb  
 it s me 
hey 
come on in 
jeez  topher  you didn t
have to go all frankie muniz on me 
i m sorry 
rust  look  i know this is your joint 
i just    
there s this girl 
i love her  man 
i love her  but she is driving me crazy 
i can t sleep  i can t work 
i quit the show  i totally phoned in
that dennis quaid movie 
 i mean  it s like    
 hello 
god  it s almost like this
kabbalah crap doesn t even work 
rusty  call for you 
dude  don t leave 
 yeah 
 i have a message for robert charles ryan   
   soon to be ex owner
of the standard hotel 
 you got him 
 last time we spoke  you hung up on me 
you used some nasty words 
i got sensitive ears 
i admit i was a little
emotional that evening 
think about that night a lot 
don t you 
i thought i d be dead before
i heard the sound that killed me 
i ve been asked to show restraint 
otherwise  you would ve gone out   
   to your favorite car of all the 17 you own 
and as soon as you turned on the ignition    
you got two weeks 
now  you told me that your wife said
that he called it ocean s 11 
now  who decided that 
i m a private contractor 
it was a collaboration 
that moniker is insuiting 
it was one job we did together 
i don t know where this proprietary stance
comes from  it seems possessive 
one could make the argument
that because it was danny s idea  
hang on a minute 
we all had our own areas of expertise 
i mean  without us 
it don t leave your head  mate 
it just hurts  you know  because   
   it seemed we all agreed
to call it  the benedict job  
that s what we called it
when we were doing it 
lf you wanted to call it
something else  
when you have a problem 
who do you go to 
 rusty 
 rusty 
thanks 
let s get back on the topic 
based on what we stole  plus interest   
    how much does everybody owe 
  1 7 34 million 
assuming benedict gives us
prime plus one  which i doubt 
figure 19 to be safe 
okay  19 each  anybody got that 
what  you think the stock market s
some great mystery   
   beyond the realm of human
understanding  didn t you see the signs 
i saw the signs 
how much is everybody short 
how much you short 
fourteen  fourteen 
 all but 5 million 
 yeah  you gonna start with me 
you don t know what it s like
to create something from scratch 
 well  with interest  i m short 7 
 eight 
i spent about a million 
mostly on talent development 
that makes it 7 for me 
boy  the interest just kills you 
 i m light 9 
 what s the interest 
 about 6 
 then i owe 6 
 how 
 what 
i ve been staying at my parents  
i owe 25 
hotels  man 
saul 
i haven t spent it all  but i will 
i m out  fellas 
as ranking old timer 
i gotta say  i just can t do it 
at my age  i think i earned
the right to be selfish 
i wanna thank you all for the wonderful
opportunity  you re all aces in my book 
but i want the last check
i write to bounce 
saul  you having a laugh 
saul 
 i can handle saul s share 
 you don t have to 
who would i talk to if you were all dead 
that s a good point 
all right  i owe 10  amazing 
yeah  but it s a nice place 
 so that comes to    
 ninety seven  give or take 
he didn t find us on his own 
 someone helped him 
 another thief 
nobody we know would
violate rule number one 
what we do know is we need a job 
we need a high paying job 
we re too hot to work
anywhere in this country 
 so we go abroad  how about we go   
 we re on the 5 00 
good  where are we going 
 amsterdam 
 amsterdam it is 
 clock s running  let s go

what are you doing 
what s wrong with you

 what 
 can i    can i

 just for a second  can i talk to you 
 what s wrong 
i just   i don t know 
this might not be the perfect time
or whatever to talk about it 
 okay 
 i ve been thinking 
i ve been doing my homework 
and i d really like   
   to play a more central role
this time around 
 right 
 i feel like i ve  
 right 
 i m ready for that  and l  
way overdue 
i was wondering if i could come to
the meeting and help you guys negotiate 
okay  it s just a sit down with matsui 
he s got his own language  this guy 
i watched you and danny really closely
last time around  i learned a ton 
linus  in my professional opinion 
you re not ready 
 okay  yeah  i mean  
 but   but   but   
   if you re convinced you are ready   
   i can speak with danny 
we can make this happen 
but you gotta be sure 
 not sure 
 no  i am 
 you re sure 
 but if i had a question  i could  
 you would call me 
 right  okay 
any time 
 okay

 all right 
 okay  awesome  thank you 
yeah 
i almost wasn t gonna
come over and say anything 
then i d still be sleeping 
 thanks  buddy 
 yeah 
 who s there 
 li   it s  
 what 
 it s linus 
ls rusty here  rusty    
 do you know where rusty is 
 no 
so have you met matsui 
seriously  what do you think of me   
   you know  in terms
of just leadership potential 
the fact that we re unemployable
shouldn t enter your mind 
otherwise  you re wasting time 
don t mention benedict
unless he does first 
and if he does  tell him everything 
right  stay on point  and don t
forget the other thing i told you 
 what 
 about listening 
relax  remember  if we don t
get this job  we re dead 
rusty  i tried calling you
all yesterday 
so finally  she slams her vodka tonic
down on the tray and says 
 hey  maybe that s why
i ve been feeling so warm recently  
yeah 
 so to business 
 to business 
a doctor who specializes in skin diseases   
   will dream he has fallen asleep
in front of the television 
later  he will wake up
in front of the television   
   but not remember his dream 
would you agree 
lf all the animals along the equator
were capable of flattery   
   then thanksgiving and halloween   
   would fall on the same date 
yeah  hey 
when i was 4 years old   
   i watched my mother
kill a spider with a tea cozy 
years later  i realized it was not a spider 
it was my uncle harold 
oh  let the sun beat down upon my face
stars to fill my dreams
i am a traveler in both time and space
to be where i have been
is he all right  are we all right 
  kashmir  
 ls that your idea of making a contribution 
 we hadn t even started yet 
 we were this close to losing that 
okay  i don t even understand what
happened in there  what did i say 
 you called his niece a whore 
 a cheap one 
 she s 7 
 confined to bed with a case of  
 no  don t tell him about it 
 i m sorry 
okay  so  what does this mean 
it means you stay here 
the mark s name is van der woude 
a semi known  weaithy recluse 
he claims to sell antiques 
but hasn t actually sold one 
his store is his privately owned home 
which no one ever enters 
but don t let van der woude s
eccentricity fool you 
the house is extremely well protected 
 what are we after 
 it s a document 
it s a very old  very valuable document 
 yeah  what is it 
 a stock certificate 
the first one ever issued
from the first corporation on the planet 
dutch east lndia trading company 
 the only one of its kind 
 what s the take 
2 5 million euro 
wait  each 
 no 
 who negotiated this 
 that s a lot of money to a lot of people 
 are you out of your mind 
lf we do one job a week at that rate 
we won t pay benedict off until    
 september 2005 
 jesus christ  danny 
i hear you  but it s what s available 
after we pull this job off   
   matsui s gonna throw us another 
it s gonna pay 10 times this one 
 which will buy an extension from benedict 
 you hope 
i hope  now  the good news is that
matsui gave us the system s master code 
 so  what are we waiting for 
 van der woude 
 that s the bad news 
 he never leaves 
 he s agoraphobic 
 he s never been out of his house 
 not in 10 years since he moved in 
 does he believe in fresh air 
 he opens his window 
 what does that mean 
 best time of arrival 
 means he opens his window 
every night at 1 30 he takes an ambien 
puts on beethoven s third 
by the fourth movement  he s out
like a light  so we go in at 3 a m 
okay  can we tap into the system
from the phone lines 
it s a closed loop system with two servers
locked in titanium cases next to his bed 
 so hacking in is out 
 look at this 
telephone repair truck 
basket up to the second floor 
telescoping rod through the window 
tap out the freak s code 
 dumb idea  one lane  one way streets 
 dumb idea 
all right  any stoppage will bring cops 
the outside is covered
by five surveillance cameras 
monitored 24 hours a day
by a security company 
he s got five exterior cameras 
 this guy is a freak 
 super freak 
what about through the roof 
 two more cameras  pressure sensors  
 a laser net over the trap door  
 smoke the freak out 
 yeah 
 smoke the freak out 
 hey 
 what 
 do we have to use that term 
 what term 
  freak  
the national lnstitute of mental heaith
estimates 5 6 percent of aduits   
    develop  agraphoriaphobia  
 agoraphobia 
whatever  i m just saying 
i mean  do we    
we don t need to be an
organization that labels people 
oh  now we re an organization 
you d call emily dickinson a freak 
 are you hosting a telethon 
 who s emily dickinson 
am i the only one who feels funny
about stealing from a    
you know  a handicapped guy 
 well  i don t care 
 hell  yeah 
i feel funny about other things 
cool 
but    
 yeah 
 but    
 right 
 what 
 ahab with a piggyback  livingston 
 i can get anything 
 it s done 
 ahab with what 
 boys 
 you re making that up  that s  
that whole  ahab with a piggyback  
that s not real 
 let me in 
 how do you think it feels   
    when someone bangs on the door 
 i gotta go to the toilet 
otherwise  i m gonna shit on your feet 
come on 
show me them specs 
i ve been doing this since
i m 12 years old  you re micromanaging 
you gotta find people you can delegate to 
otherwise  you ll never have a life 
i don t want a life  i want the hotel
to run like a hotel should 
reuben 
yeah 
great 
 okay  good 
 maybe 
fantastic 
remember in miller s crossing
where turturro begs for his life 
sure   look into your heart  
i cry every time 
what 
we have no line of sight 
our only possibility  the window 
we re three inches too high 
there s no clear shot  even with basher 
ln the physical universe we occupy 
it cannot be done 
what about the guy
from the bulgari job 
 nagel  spoke with him 
 anything 
lot of ideas  none of them any good 
he s pushing this new
holographic technology 
really interesting stuff  though 
he can reproduce anything 3 d 
how about 97 million 
we re forcing it 
yeah  we re forcing it 
 you know what we haven t thought of 
 what 
we turn ourselves in 
 what could benedict do to us then 
 there you go 
call the cops 
tell them we did the bellagio job 
they put us away for 20 years 
that d teach him 
i think tess would stick around 
you look great in jumpsuits 
hey   
    how s the hotel business 
 sucks 
 how s east haven 
 sucks 
i don t know 
can t turn my brain off  you know 
it s me 
we go into some place 
and all i can do is see the angles 
it s what i do  it s what
i ve always done  i love it 
i don t know 
some sort of weird irony  you know 
tess watching me scratch and itch 
hey  listen  you know 
the world s gone nuts and you re    
 what d you wanna do 
 it s not attached to the adjacent buildings 
 the whole house 
 we re just raising it slightly 
schumann did it in  64 in venice
and  73 in lstanbul 
 he only had a crew of six 
 we can t tiit a house 
 did it with the leaning tower of pizza 
 exactly  thank you 
 it took 300 men over two years to do it 
 there s 30 pylons 
we cut them  insert the jacks
and crank away 
it s really our best plan 
considering it s our only plan 
 crank for how long 
 like i said  it s our only plan 
what 
oh  oh  okay  hold on 
try that 
number five  i m a go 
master thieves who practice the long con
live separate lives as civilians 
they have legitimate jobs and families   
   which make them
extremely difficuit to catch 
the greatest thief of all time was 
without question   
   gaspar lemarc  who either died
in portugal in 1988   
   or in hong kong in 1996 
or he s still alive 
we may never know for certain 
because lemarc   
   was never captured or photographed   
   despite being active for over 50 years 
though he left behind a slew
of imitators   
   only one is worth mentioning
in the same breath as lemarc 
the thief we know only
as the night fox 
so named for the small onyx figurines
he leaves behind to taunt us   
   the night fox must be considered
our number one priority 
his string of high profile crimes are
an embarrassment to our branch   
   to our entire profession 
we need more than traditional resources
to pursue thieves like the night fox 
we need to train ourselves to think the
way they think  to see what they see 
and we should not allow ourselves
to be distracted  
i m sorry  someone just robbed
the van der woude house 
what 
hi  lsabel  well  we could really use
your help on this one 
i hope the scene hasn t
been contaminated 
when can i speak to mr  van der woude 
probably tomorrow  he s heavily sedated 
we can t figure out how they disabled
the alarm  shorted it out somehow 
no  that would have triggered the system
and damaged the circuits 
well  then 
then i don t know how they got in 
they had the code  someone other than
the owner must have known it 
lmpossible  van der woude programmed
the last nine steps of the system 
he set it and never left the house again 
closed loop  redundant servers 
titanium encasement 
it s not bad  actually 
yeah  thanks 
do we know each other 
 i think i saw you yesterday 
 oh  yeah 
yeah  you were being chased
by the police 
chasing me  no  i don t think so 
i m quite sure it was you 
doesn t say much for the police 
no  i love rome  i love it 
but there s an opening at work
the level above me  and it s  
i was thinking i was gonna try out for it 
it s in amsterdam 
my mother has family there  so it d be  
it d be good 
 he lifted the whole house 
 the whole house 
 the entire house 
 the entire house 
it s called a schumann special   
   named affer this guy  a brilliant guy 
max schumann 
then he did it in lstanbul in 1973 
what is it 
it s where the crossbow boit hit 
the crossbow boit 
they fired from that rooftop
through this open window 
with a crossbow boit from that roof
through that window 
 that s a very difficuit shot 
 no  it is an impossible shot   
   until they raised the building 
check the pylons  they ll be elevated 
 you know the name max schumann 
 no 
 well  they do 
 who 
the americans 
wait a minute 
exactly why would they bring the drill
if they weren t planning to use it 
 what 
 oh  god 
 what 
 i don t know 
congratulations  you are the second person
to crack the van der woude safe tonight 
ln arriving second  mr  ocean 
you have joined a long line   
   of people who ve worked hard and risked
a great deal only to get somewhere second 
you don t know these people by name 
of course  because they enter oblivion 
you know this word   oblivion  
it means to be totally forgotten
by everyone forever 
and it s where you would be now
if it weren t for the bellagio heist 
how does this guy know who we are 
ln a way  i m responsible for you
coming to amsterdam in the first place 
i hired matsui  and matsui hired you 
that s the guy who dimed us
to benedict 
 all of them  including ocean 
 yes 
i find that hard to believe 
and you are 
you can call me the night fox 
the night fox  okay  mr  night fox 
 what will this information cost me 
 don t worry  nothing 
nothing  who do you think you re
dealing with  nothing costs nothing 
and this information is definitely
worth something 
let s just say our interests
are temporarily aligned 
how so 
well  the information is free 
but it comes with certain conditions 
 such as 
 restraint on your part 
restraint  that s asking a lot 
what else 
two weeks to buy themselves
out of trouble 
two weeks 
i can live with that  even if they can t 
just out of curiosity 
what will you make them pay 
for letting them live 
everything they stole  plus interest 
a lot of interest 
but didn t your insurance
cover what was stolen 
of course 
so you re asking them to double
your money 
well  do you really think that s fair 
fair  i certainly hope not 
so  what about the information 
okay  it s on your desk 
he was here 
around 3 30 this morning  i can tell 
 who 
 the night fox 
go down to the dampkring
and pick up a guy called matsui

you too 
of course  you ve been seeing
plenty of me  haven t you 
i like this one 
i call it  thief à la mode  
schumann special  huh 
i guess that s what i get
for opening my mouth 
so  what about the night fox 
did he leave you a message 
what about the figurine 
you still have it 
i suppose it s a compliment in a way 
i guess he s threatened by you 
though i can t imagine why 
you have no idea what you re up against 
the french police
think he s better than lemarc 
well  he is french 
let me give you some advice 
find out how you offended him 
apologize  beg for mercy 
got to go 
any message for frank 
he s been hanging around the station 
on what charge 
well  we found a print of a size 14
hi tec magnum boot at the crime scene 
and 
bought with a fraudulent credit card 
from that point on  well  there s only one 
maybe two great nail salons in amsterdam 
 and you lied to us 
 yeah  and to me 
well  frank knew 
 frank knew you were in touch 
 i wasn t in touch 
i was more like keeping tabs 
 she s a cop 
 detective  actually 
 where d she learn all that schumann crap 
 dad 
 what  he was a cop 
 thief 
 oh  god  was he good 
 oh  yeah 
great  pissed off ex girlfriend
whose thief father   
   taught her every trick in the book 
well  she just made danny and yen 
ln the next 48 hours  your pictures
will be in every police station 
 nobody looks at them 
 nobody but cops 
 detectives 
 you d think she d have sympathy for us   
    if her old man was a thief 
 ls that sympathy or empathy 
no  her old man got popped a day
before her 9th birthday  died in jail 
so i wouldn t count on much sympathy 
or empathy 
she s gonna have the hotel
under surveillance 
great  we ll just eat room service  watch
movies and wait for benedict to kill us 
 who s on the  100 bill 
 adams 
 john travoita 
 he said every problem   
   is an opportunity in disguise 
he couldn t say that
with a 45 in his mouth 
no  you re missing the silver lining here 
now  she gave us a name  didn t she 
the night fox 
one phone call  we re gonna find out
everything there is to know about this guy 
the name is m  diaz 
d l a z 
it s a black duffel bag 
the team s in rotterdam 
the bag s in brussels 
he s the modern man 
disconnected  frightened   
   paranoid  but with good reason 
it s too sad to be funny 
unusable 
 i think i can get 20 minutes out of it 
 great 
i got it  the team s in barcelona 
the bag s in madrid 
this is a moral issue
we re dealing with here 
and we don t have a grease man anymore 
because he s in a bag somewhere 
we got a bag man 
such an ape  an animal with no feelings 
 i have feelings 
 no  you don t 
i feel bad for the guy  he s in a piece
of luggage  but he s got water 
 what did you want them to do 
 get off the bus 
and pick up the bag
with our friend in it 
how many pro soccer teams
are fielding 50 year old men 
rusty s not 50 years old 
yeah  dude  we know rusty s not 50 
you think i m 50 years old 
let me ask you something 
no  wait  let me ask you something 
how old do you think i am 
forty eight 
you think i m 48 years old 
fifty two 
 maybe he should ve asked me 
 nobody should ever ask you anything 
that guy doesn t have a hard enough
life right now  you gotta  
you re gonna defend him 
they put yen in a handbag 
 can i ask you something  ever notice   
 lf you re gonna ask a question   
   give me time to respond 
unless it s rhetorical   
   in which case the answer
is obvious  yes 
 okay  can i ask   
 yes 
 you ever notice that tess looks exactly   
 don t ever ask that  seriously 
 not to anyone  especially not to her 
 wait  why not 
look 
it s not in my nature to be mysterious   
   but i can t talk about it 
and i can t talk about why 
 can i ask you    do i look 50 to you 
 yeah 
 really 
 well  i mean  only from the neck up 
saul  what s the matter 
nothing 
you wanna go out  it s nice 
no 
you wanna watch something 
the game s on 
no 
 you hungry  i ll heat something up 
 no 
saul  ever since you got back 
you ve been acting strange 
what did danny want 
nothing 
nothing  how could he want nothing 
all right  the night fox has a name 
françois toulour 
baron françois toulour 
father was a french industrialist 
mother was italian nobility 
he never met her 
but he inherited her title 
the bad news is he s rich  he s bored
and he s talented 
the really bad news is he was trained
by lemarc 
 this is not good 
 with the lemarc  gaspar lemarc 
that s the one 
 well  we re doomed 
 we re not doomed 
 he s one guy  and he s french 
 yeah 
before we get too impressed
by his background   
    let s hear what he s done 
 he started in the  90s 
bank of geneva  the danish treasury 
the bank of italy  amc amro   
   the brussels diamond exchange 
antwerp diamond exchange 
 wait  wait  all those in the 1990s 
 i m only up to  96 
 seriously 
 ln  97  he went through an art phase 
he hit the tate in london  the louvre
in paris  twice  and the prado 
wait  no  no  hang on  the prado museum
in  97  that was moretti 
 everybody knows that  
 he is moretti  it s one of his aliases 
okay  i ll skip to my favorite 
ln 2002  he stole the king of morocco s
200 foot yacht  vanished into thin air 
crew surfaced days later in a life raft 
couldn t remember a thing 
 how do you hide a 200 foot yacht 
 lf the king knows  he s not telling 
he got it back a month later  he now plays
tennis with toulour every weekend 
 we re in some serious trouble here 
 copy that 
 so  what do we do 
 we respond 
 respond  how 
 ln kind 
mr  ocean 
you broke rule number one 
and that has consequences 
oh  you must be talking about
the paintings 
don t worry  you ll be dead in five days 
and i ll get my paintings back 
 unless you have an accident first 
 i don t think so  daniel 
perhaps i should explain to you
why i m tormenting you 
i d like that 
last month i was in portugal
to see my mentor 
 lemarc 
 lndeed 
a very loud and annoying american
businessman was there the same day 
he worked for a big insurance company 
he s the one who suggested benedict
to you as a potential mark 
 you know the man 
 what about him 
he said it was the most
beautiful job he d ever seen 
he went on and on about this job 
and then he said   
   it showed you were the greatest
thief in the world 
but the worst part is that lemarc
never corrected him 
i told lemarc that you can t be
better than me 
and he answered that it was impossible
to know for sure 
so i thought about that for  like 
three weeks in a row  day and night 
and then suddenly  i realized that
he was actually right 
it is impossible to compare one theft
to the other 
so i guess the only way to know
who s the best of us for sure   
   is to go after the same object 
do the same job 
don t you think that would be fun 
you re being awfully cavalier with a lot of
people s lives so you can play out a game 
you re gonna regret it 
come on  mr  ocean 
how are you gonna possibly get
 97 million by next wednesday 
especially if every safe you crack
between now and then is already empty 
whereas if you accept my challenge
and win   
   i promise i ll pay your debt
to benedict   
   and lemarc will hold my money
in escrow as a guarantee 
what are we stealing 
the famous fabergé coronation egg 
 was that your idea or lemarc s 
 i think he would agree   
   that it s the most appropriate thing
for us to compete over 
where is it located 
the egg leff paris this morning
on its way to rome 
it travels with heavy security and usually
with one or more replicas 
sometimes they even show the replicas
without anybody knowing 
when the egg goes on display
monday morning   
   you ll have 48 hours to steal it
before your deadline s up 
when the deadline passes
and you don t have the egg   
   lemarc will know who s the best 
 rusty s phone 
 who is this 
nicole  who s this 
nagel  where s rusty 
he said if you called 
to say he was at gunther s 
gunther s  what s that about 
did he say something 
do you have a message 
yes  i do  tell him this thing is gonna
cost him double what i told him 
and tell him i had to go three times
as thin on the layers 
and tell him if he wants it tomorrow 
it should cost him more than double 
and tell him this thing is beautiful 
would fool the bloody romanovs
themselves 
and tell him i m being a nice guy 
and tell him he dresses like a gigolo 
ls that it 
yeah  no  tell him having
a sexy female assistant   
   is such a terrible cliché 
can i get a coffee or something 
thanks  just a cappuccino or espresso 
well    
you call me on saturday
and ask me to come into my office   
   and sign a 1077   
   and you can t even tell me
what they are affer 
 i can come to your house 
 i m leaving for naples in two hours 
 we ll talk about this on wednesday 
 it ll be gone by wednesday 
 what  what  what will be gone 
 something worth signing a 1077 for 
ryan and his friends
did the bellagio casino heist in 2001 
 i am telling you  this is serious  
 lf that s true   
    then we should call the american fbl  
 no  no  no 
 maurizio  listen to me 
 agent lahiri   
   a 1077 is not a small thing 
unless you can tell me what they are affer 
there is no point in discussing it 
hey  
because lemarc stole it in 1980
when 23 others failed 
because the night fox is trying to prove
he s better than ryan and his friends 
this is ridiculous 
you say the egg will be stolen 
then you say lemarc already stole it
24 years ago 
 which one is it 
 both 
what 
lemarc s wife made him
put the egg back 
when i signed a 1077 for you
on the bulgari case   
   you requisitioned 30 of my men
for three months and made zero arrests 
i won t do it again 
first  we cannot go at night 
the laser grid in the great hall s
impossible to beat 
 nothing s impossible 
 this is impossible 
it s in constant motion  programmed
to improvise randomly   
   meaning we can t
plan our way through 
all right 
so it s a daytime play 
we re still short three on the inside
since lsabel made you and yen and danny 
we could try a smuggler s paradise 
 it hasn t worked since the  50s 
  54  actually 
what s option two 
baby jane  squeaky wheel 
followed by a number two son 
it s complicated  but it s got a high
success rate  the only problem is  
we can t do it without a grease man
on the inside  without yen 
we ll have to risk it 
we ll put him in disguise 
10 10  i leave the café 
proceed west  10 11  
 i enter the second floor bathroom 
 10 13 
approach the spanish steps
from the south 
basher and i enter by the main entrance 
 10 15 
 i help yen into the ventilation duct 
 10 18 
 i move reuben to the egg room 
 i pause in the great hall while  
 i go to the egg room 
 10 21  
 yen enters the mainframe room 
he cuts power to grid 14 a 
he radios me  i signal linus 
 i then go to the egg room 
 i 0 22 
i drop my keys and move reuben
to his mark 
 i blind camera one 
 i blind camera two 
 i blind camera three 
 camera four 
 i make the switch 
 right 
 10 24 
 i pull to the corner of the main entrance 
i meet danny at the steps 
we head north  10 25 
turk and i make the drop 
all right  really good stuff  guys 
really good work  all right 
we ll pick it up here in an hour 
it s a slam dunk 
 great 
 10 45  we all get arrested 
you bet 
 how was toulour 
 he was predictable 
you hear from nagel 
he ll be here 
that s a lot to presume
from a guy like nagel 
follow it up 
this is lsabel 
it s johan  i just set a 6 00 meeting
for you with an andre ciment   
   who says he had four paintings stolen
from his house in lake como 
 and when was this 
 sometime friday 
he s missing two monets 
a turner and a degas 
 which degas was it 
 blue dancers 
supposedly  there s surveillance video 
but i haven t been able to confirm that yet 
it is all about error correction 
three thousand separate 
translucent  digital slivers   
   instead of the 1000
i thought it would be 
thank god it doesn t have to move 
re creating the lighting was a pain 
it s a mixture of tungsten and real light 
but i think the color rendition
is pretty damn accurate 
batteries are in the base 
two minutes maximum 
you re good 
 it s good  roman  you re a genius 
 i think i am 
you d have never got past that grid 
that s why you re paying me double 
 what  no  no  no 
 you got my message 
 who s that sexy phone voice  early bond 
 what message 
the message i left with
sexy phone voice nicole 
on your mobile 
got something going
with gunther  am i in 
 okay  when did you leave the message 
 two days ago 
she had your phone 
 she has your   
 yeah 
 that means that she s   
 yeah 
 well  you better  
 yeah 
 that s great 
 i mean    
so    so who s got my money 
who has got my bloody money 
jesus 
sorry to hear about your mom 
she was an amazing    
well  i thought so  at least 
she hated you 
i should ve picked up on that 
 she hated all thieves 
 no wonder you fought 
excuse me 
 may i have my phone back 
 no 
 that s a nice pull  by the way 
 thanks 
did you get that tingling sensation
down your spine when you did it 
or is that none of my business 
you considered a career change 
have you 
i tried hotels 
i m better at this 
went by the café for some tiramisu 
 it wasn t the same 
 who s the night fox 
 they did something to the eggs 
 why accept his challenge 
because he ll lose 
and how can you beat him 
we can t 
you re not making any sense 
okay 
the bulgari job you pulled with frank
when we were together   
   i knew it was you 
why didn t you say something 
why didn t you   
   robert 
i didn t want it to end 
you assumed it would 
was i wrong 
you shouldn t be here 
i have a meeting 
someone stole a whole bunch
of paintings in lake como 
lnteresting  any leads 
the next time i see you   
   i m arresting you 
and ocean and anybody else i recognize 
fair enough 
 ready 
 right 
yes  of course i do 
my blue dancers  my degas 
they took it  unfortunately 
and i really would like  
do you have any enemies 
anybody out there who would
feel wronged by you 
no  i can t see anyone 
but why  you think  
you think maybe the thief   
   is trying to harm me personally now 
well  i assumed he was after
the paintings themselves 
i think it s enough 
ready 
good 
i have something you might be
interested in 
it s a dvd with all the hidden
surveillance cameras i have to my place 
it s plenty  i haven t checked it out yet 
maybe the thieves have been
careless enough to be photographed 
i doubt it  this level of thief 
but i ll take a look 
yeah  you never know 
okay  well  merci 
thank you  mademoiselle lahiri 
for everything 
thank you  goodbye  goodbye 
mademoiselle lahiri

the night before 
but    
oh  he s mean 
he s just mean spirited 
 how many espressos did you have 
 five 
yeah  come on 
i don t know if she s just confused   
   or she s really turned the corner
and hates me now 
you think i handled this wrong 
i was too forceful 
i was too american 
she s different 
maybe you re right 
maybe she has moved on 
you know  i talked to a doctor
about getting that tattoo removed 
but given its location 
he advised against it 
that guy doing potsie is unbelievable 
i mean  what s this guy s problem 
he s stitched us up twice in two weeks 
all over his ego 
it s the first decent evening we ve
had together in i don t know how long 
all right  all right 
let s just stay on point here 
let s go over the list again 
who died and made you danny 
no one 
i m sorry  my emotions
are all over the place 
i was forceful  trying
to show good leadership  
 for fuck s sake  let s go 
 you re a good leader 
thanks 
all right  well 
let s go over the list again 
 swinging priest 
 not enough people 
 crazy larry 
 not enough people 
 soft shoulder 
 not enough people 
 baker s dozen 
 no woman and not enough people 
hell in a handbasket 
we can t train a cat that quickly 
and not enough people 
 what about tess 
 what about her 
well  you know how she
kind of looks like  
 so what 
 yeah  what s your point 
so we do a lookie loo 
 it s a lookie loo with a bundle of joy 
 a lookie loo with tess   
   and a bundle of joy 
you ve gone right out of your tree 
my son  he s mad 
it s crazy  it s italian television crazy 
and we re still one short 
no  think about it  she can get near the egg
during daylight with half the system down 
i mean  that s a trifecta 
he might be right  make the calls 
linus caldwell  you are not
following the procedures   
   danny talked about
if terry benedict shows up 
something is wrong  what is wrong 
danny s fine  he s with rusty 
during this part of the plan 
they can t communicate with us 
promise he isn t hurt 
i promise he isn t hurt 
you re gonna miss the deadline 
danny would be thrilled if you met him
in rome when the job s finished 
he misses you like crazy 
plus  you studied art 
so i know how much you love rome 
there s no downside here 
wow  they re bringing you
along fast  aren t they 
yes  danny would be more thrilled   
   if you were on the 7 p m  out of jfk 
which means you have to leave right now 
i thought i d requested a midsize 
 danny here 
 he wanted to be 
did you have a nice flight  we weren t
sure if you were a window or aisle person 
 how long s danny been in jail 
 just a couple of days  really 
which  you know  on the bright side 
he s completely safe from benedict 
he told me everything was fine 
he lied right to me 
what i think he meant by  fine 
is we re running low on time and money   
   and we re deeper in debt
than when we started 
i assume that you have a plan
to get him out 
 actually  she sounds like her 
 no  she needs a southern accent 
 can you do a southern   
 what the hell is going on with you guys 
not quite  the accent is crucial 
it s the first thing people notice 
 this ridiculous car  what is it doing 
 okay  i m sorry 
all right  i m just gonna level with you 
due to certain personnel losses   
   that we have sustained   
   we re   various readjustments
had to be made 
you re gonna have to play a small role
in this thing 
okay  so can you put these on 
i d like you to put this hat on 
you re gonna put on that 
and you re gonna stuff it with that 
and we ll turn around 
just give you a little moment 
small role

that she would think of us again

you re playing a role 
no  you re playing a role 
i m apparently playing a real person 
 yeah  so 
 it s just wrong 
you mean  like  morally 
no  well  yes 
probably   it s not the point 
the point is you want me to speak   
   for someone who s out there somewhere 
it s too personal 
more personal than your husband
doing 25 to life 
he won t do 25 to life  benedict will
have him killed immediately

you figured that out 
 yeah  i mean  the movie still works for me

can we just    does she really
need to be rushing this quickly 
 she s practically jogging 
 ln thailand

rice paddies and then go right back to work 
 amazing women over there 
 rice paddy 
she will not have it in a rice paddy 
she ll be at her own paddy 
and she will be very comfortable
because she will be strong   
   from this walk and this exercise 
was she worth it 
was tess 
the moment that she doesn t talk to you
in the restaurant  i knew 
 your friends didn t tell you 
 no 
 that s when you figured it out  huh 
 yeah 
 but the movie was still enjoyable for me 
 okay  thanks 
lf everybody s so freaking smart  how come
the movie did  675 million worldwide   
   theatrical

isabel lahiri  i m with the museum 
it is so great to meet you 
 we re very late 
 i m sorry  this won t take long 
i don t wanna be an annoying fan 
but my boyfriend is such a huge fan 
i can t let you leave unless you sign
something for him  do you mind 
 that s very unorthodox 
 sorry  it won t take long 
 what s his name 
 his name s robert 
aren t you a lefty 
i thought you were a lefty 
she is a lefty 
often pregnant women
become ambidextrous 
you are a big fan 
she doesn t necessarily
have to sign lefty 
oh  thanks so much  this is great 
okay  we re on the move 
thank you  you take care  now 
and one more thing 
i just got off the phone   
   with someone called marcy who put you
on a plane from taos  new mexico to l a   
   where you have a 1 00 meeting
about a film  clowns can t sleep 
anyway  she just wanted me to let you
know everyone s running a little late   
   and was wondering if you could
make it at 1 30 instead 
i knew it 
shame on you 
i don t think we ve met  bruce 
isabel lahiri  nice to meet you 
do you really have a boyfriend 
or were you just    was that just
part of the whole thing with them 
so how d it go 
you lahiri 
i m section chief molly starr 
i spoke to a very nice man at europol
this morning  commissioner greisman 
he wants you on the next flight
to amsterdam 
there seems to be some irregularity
with your paperwork 
that one 
let s start with that one 
lmagine yourself in a room   
   that s too short for you to stand up in
and not wide enough for you to lie down in 
a room with no light  no heat   
   and stone walls scratched by the teeth
and nails of desperate men   
   men driven crazy by isolation 
you will have rats for company   
   and a small window that looks out
on the world that has passed you by 
your parents will grow old and die 
just like your dreams 
your friends will forget your name 
tell your stories as their own   
   because what good is a story when
the person who owns it has vanished 
 what do you want 
 testify against the others   
   in the benedict case 
the italian charges will be dropped 
you and the others will be extradited
to the u s  this afternoon 
plead  and you walk with parole 
i can t 
think about it  linus 
for a moment there 
i was already forgetting your name 
wait 
just hang on a sec 
linus 
right  thanks 
you okay 
 well  i blew the meet with matsui 
 matsui 
let me guess  he pulled
a lost in translation on you 
that s his idea of fun for first timers 
 i mean   how do i not see these things 
 don t get down on yourself 
 obvious 
 we talked about this 
i hope danny and rusty appreciate the job
you did in a tight jam  i am proud of you 
 thanks 
 we both are 
 you    you told dad 
 i had to  sweetheart 
 you told dad 
 we were on vacation 
i m sorry 
great  thanks  you re gonna be
dining out on this one for months 
 hey  remember the time your mom
had to come to rome     
i m sorry 
every time with him  it s like    
it s like a    
it s like a    
that was for keeping me in the dark 
and that   that   
   is for making me a master thief 
 and that   
 okay 
   is for ruining our
second third anniversary 
okay  okay  come here 
i m sorry i kept you in the dark 
i m sorry that i made you a thief 
 master 
 master thief 
and i m very sorry that i ruined
our second third anniversary 
 okay 
 okay 
you forgive me 
 a little 
 all right 
what was bruce willis like  was he   
follow it  that s ryan s car 
follow that one 
hey  wait  wait 
what the hell is going on 
your father s alive  lzzy 
your mom lied to you   
    to keep you from him  he s alive 
 what are you talking about 
when they divorced  she told him if he
contacted you  she d go to the cops   
   with everything to put him in jail 
how do you know that 
and why should i believe you 
i don t believe you  okay 
you know where he is 
i know somebody who does 
there s nothing back there
but a forged 1077 
 no  really  no 
 no 
that d be horrible 
it s hard  you know  for dinners 
well  you must have very good contacts 
i hear it usually takes days
to buy your way out 
 tess  this is françois toulour 
 madame ocean  at last 
 hello 
 he s french 
shouldn t you be somewhere else
by now  like   
   outer mongolia  maybe 
well  before we get to that 
we just wanted to ask you one question 
 what is that 
 how d you do it 
oh  so that s why you came 
you wanna know 
well  i guess that s normal 
but i got another deal for you 
you both recognize that i m the best 
and i ll tell you my secret 
 yeah 
 that    
make it if you get him to tell us   
    and tell him that he is the best 
 oh  okay 
 i won t tell him because you re the best 
 all right  thank you 
all right 
we ll tell you you re the best
after you tell us how you did it 
how can i refuse
a dying man s last request 
the egg arrived in rome at 6 45 p m 
the saturday before it went on display 
 it was at the museum by 8 p m 
 wait a minute  hold on 
you stole it that evening 
with the museum locked down 
how d you get in the building 
how d you get past the sensors 
why didn t my recon team see you 
 don t touch my thing 
 i didn t touch your thing  like it works 
you got greasy hands  you put them
on the lens  now i can t see 
 you can t see anything 
 i see you  you look like a retard 
you look like a retard 
i ll pay you a million dollars if you don t
speak for a month  one month 
 i wanna eat your whole head 
 go ahead  a million dollars  no joke 
right  with no equipment  no rope 
of course  come on  don t tell me
you don t know how to do that 
how did you get by the laser field
in the great hall 
the laser fields  well    
okay  toulour  you re the best 
well  thank you  danny 
good  now  if you can just
get us our money   
   we ll be going 
the money 
what money 
the money that you agreed
to pay benedict if we won 
 we re under a deadline 
 no  no  no  you don t understand 
you didn t win 
you lost  and not only did you lose   
   your entire crew got pinched 
i gotta tell you something 
you don t look anything like her 
eventually  the nose  but the ears  
i mean  the way you walk
and you dress    
that means that you spoke to lemarc 
you spoke to lemarc 
since i m dead  i think my involvement
in this should stay among the three of us 
 of course 
 absolutely 
it s ironic that the solution to all of
our problems will be provided by toulour 
i m sure i provoked him by agreeing with my
american friend that you might be better 
i apologize sincerely for the trouble
i ve caused you 
 there s no need 
 especially now 
remember  from the time you see toulour
at his villa and the challenge begins   
   you must assume he will have you
under surveillance everywhere you go 
you ll have to put on
a very elaborate show 
the egg  the real egg   
   will be carried in a backpack
on a train leaving gare du nord   
    at 9 30 a m 
 thank you 
you saved our lives  gaspar 
yeah  and i m still getting
the better of you 
and i stole a replica 
your paintings are in a high security
warehouse in milan 
it s 1 via andreotti  unit 222 
 security code is 2 3 1 1 6  
 6 4 6  thank you 
listen  all games aside  that was  
that was very good 
that was good  how d you do that 
well  i told you one story tonight 
i think that ll be enough  so now   
   if you  both of you  could please    
now 
 whose house is this 
 it belongs to a thief i know in paris 
he knows my father 
probably better than anyone 
who is he 
 he helped with the whole night fox thing 
 what s his name 
his real name  i don t know  actually 
i ve only known him as lemarc 
lemarc 
oh  my god 
where the hell have you been 
waiting 
for what

lssue closed

 it s good  trust me 
i don t trust you  and i don t trust ocean 
lf it s good  we re done 
these grudges  they re awful 
nobody wins 
danny s had enough of this meshugaas 
and the competition 
it s worse than our business 
always some new young punk
trying to prove himself 
guys like ocean  they keep coming back 
they don t like to lose 
 too much ego  too much pride 
 maybe for some guys  but not danny 
trust me on that 
danny don t feel like he lost in all this 
it s hard to believe 
but that s how he feels 
well  if he tries anything   lf anybody
tries anything  i ll be waiting 
terry  i can t predict the future 
i pay professionals to do that 
and even they get it wrong sometimes 
i can t say that nobody ll ever
try to rob from you again 
but i can say this  lf  god forbid 
anything does happen to you   
   we will not be involved 
you better not be  reuben
