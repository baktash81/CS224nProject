he owns this hotel in los angeles
losing a lot of money
and hes got no life
hes a nice bright kid
but hes beating his brains out
do you think i could send something
through you like a message to him
i read your palm not his
somebody who could do that could do
very well anything on my heaith
my hips are bothering me
please
this you couldnt see this
i tried knocking he wont open
ill handle it i know him
jesus christ are you people retarded
it says do not disturb

jeez topher you didnt
have to go all frankie muniz on me
im sorry
rust look i know this is your joint
i just
theres this girl
i love her man
i love her but she is driving me crazy
i cant sleep i cant work
i quit the show i totally phoned in
that dennis quaid movie
i mean its like
hello
god its almost like this
kabbalah crap doesnt even work
rusty call for you
dude dont leave
yeah
i have a message for robert charles ryan
soon to be exowner
of the standard hotel
you got him
last time we spoke you hung up on me
you used some nasty words
i got sensitive ears
i admit i was a little
emotional that evening
think about that night a lot
dont you
i thought id be dead before
i heard the sound that killed me
ive been asked to show restraint
otherwise you wouldve gone out
to your favorite car of all the 17 you own
and as soon as you turned on the ignition
you got two weeks
now you told me that your wife said
that he called it oceans 11
now who decided that
im a private contractor
it was a collaboration
that moniker is insuiting
it was one job we did together
i dont know where this proprietary stance
comes from it seems possessive
one could make the argument
that because it was dannys idea
hang on a minute
we all had our own areas of expertise
i mean without us
it dont leave your head mate
it just hurts you know because
it seemed we all agreed
to call it the benedict job
thats what we called it
when we were doing it
lf you wanted to call it
something else
when you have a problem
who do you go to
rusty
rusty
thanks
lets get back on the topic
based on what we stole plus interest
how much does everybody owe
1 734 million
assuming benedict gives us
prime plus one which i doubt
figure 19 to be safe
okay 19 each anybody got that
what you think the stock markets
some great mystery
beyond the realm of human
understanding didnt you see the signs
i saw the signs
how much is everybody short
how much you short
fourteen fourteen
all but 5 million
yeah you gonna start with me
you dont know what its like
to create something from scratch
well with interest im short 7

opportunity youre all aces in my book
but i want the last check
i write to bounce
saul you having a laugh
saul

ive been thinking
ive been doing my homework
and id really like
to play a more central role
this time around

i feel like ive

im ready for that and l
way overdue
i was wondering if i could come to
the meeting and help you guys negotiate
okay its just a sitdown with matsui
hes got his own language this guy
i watched you and danny really closely
last time around i learned a ton
linus in my professional opinion
youre not ready

if youre convinced you are ready
i can speak with danny

thanks buddy
yeah
whos there
li its
what
its linus
ls rusty here rusty
do you know where rusty is
no
so have you met matsui
seriously what do you think of me
you know in terms
of just leadership potential
the fact that were unemployable
shouldnt enter your mind
otherwise youre wasting time
dont mention benedict
unless he does first
and if he does tell him everything
right stay on point and dont
forget the other thing i told you
what
about listening
relax remember if we dont
get this job were dead
rusty i tried calling you
all yesterday
so finally she slams her vodka tonic
down on the tray and says
hey maybe thats why
ive been feeling so warm recently
yeah
so to business
to business
a doctor who specializes in skin diseases
will dream he has fallen asleep
in front of the television
later he will wake up
in front of the television
but not remember his dream
would you agree
lf all the animals along the equator
were capable of flattery
then thanksgiving and halloween
would fall on the same date
yeah hey
when i was 4 years old
i watched my mother
kill a spider with a tea cozy
years later i realized it was not a spider
it was my uncle harold
oh let the sun beat down upon my face
stars to fill my dreams
i am a traveler in both time and space
to be where i have been
is he all right are we all right
kashmir
ls that your idea of making a contribution
we hadnt even started yet
we were this close to losing that
okay i dont even understand what
happened in there what did i say
you called his niece a whore
a cheap one
shes 7
confined to bed with a case of
no dont tell him about it
im sorry
okay so what does this mean
it means you stay here
the marks name is van der woude
a semiknown weaithy recluse
he claims to sell antiques
but hasnt actually sold one
his store is his privately owned home
which no one ever enters
but dont let van der woudes
eccentricity fool you
the house is extremely wellprotected
what are we after
its a document
its a very old very valuable document
yeah what is it
a stock certificate
the first one ever issued
from the first corporation on the planet
dutch east lndia trading company
the only one of its kind
whats the take
25 million euro
wait each
no
who negotiated this
thats a lot of money to a lot of people
are you out of your mind
lf we do one job a week at that rate
we wont pay benedict off until
september 2005
jesus christ danny
i hear you but its whats available
after we pull this job off
matsuis gonna throw us another
its gonna pay 10 times this one
which will buy an extension from benedict
you hope
i hope now the good news is that
matsui gave us the systems master code
so what are we waiting for
van der woude
thats the bad news
he never leaves
hes agoraphobic
hes never been out of his house
not in 10 years since he moved in
does he believe in fresh air
he opens his window
what does that mean
best time of arrival
means he opens his window
every night at 130 he takes an ambien
puts on beethovens third
by the fourth movement hes out
like a light so we go in at 3 am
okay can we tap into the system
from the phone lines
its a closedloop system with two servers
locked in titanium cases next to his bed
so hacking in is out
look at this
telephonerepair truck
basket up to the second floor
telescoping rod through the window
tap out the freaks code
dumb idea one lane oneway streets
dumb idea
all right any stoppage will bring cops
the outside is covered
by five surveillance cameras
monitored 24 hours a day
by a security company
hes got five exterior cameras
this guy is a freak
super freak
what about through the roof
two more cameras pressure sensors
a laser net over the trap door
smoke the freak out
yeah
smoke the freak out
hey
what
do we have to use that term
what term
freak
the national lnstitute of mental heaith
estimates 56 percent of aduits

agoraphobia
whatever im just saying
i mean do we

organization that labels people

youd call emily dickinson a freak
are you hosting a telethon
whos emily dickinson
am i the only one who feels funny
about stealing from a
you know a handicapped guy
well i dont care
hell yeah

yeah
but
right
what
ahab with a piggyback livingston
i can get anything

ahab with what
boys

that whole ahab with a piggyback
thats not real
let me in
how do you think it feels
when someone bangs on the door
i gotta go to the toilet
otherwise im gonna shit on your feet
come on
show me them specs
ive been doing this since
im 12 years old youre micromanaging
you gotta find people you can delegate to
otherwise youll never have a life
i dont want a life i want the hotel
to run like a hotel should
reuben
yeah
great
okay good
maybe
fantastic
remember in millers crossing
where turturro begs for his life
sure look into your heart
i cry every time
what
we have no line of sight
our only possibility the window
were three inches too high
theres no clear shot even with basher
ln the physical universe we occupy
it cannot be done
what about the guy
from the bulgari job
nagel spoke with him
anything
lot of ideas none of them any good
hes pushing this new
holographic technology
really interesting stuff though
he can reproduce anything 3d
how about 97 million
were forcing it
yeah were forcing it
you know what we havent thought of
what
we turn ourselves in
what could benedict do to us then
there you go
call the cops
tell them we did the bellagio job
they put us away for 20 years
thatd teach him
i think tess would stick around
you look great in jumpsuits
hey
hows the hotel business
sucks
hows east haven
sucks
i dont know
cant turn my brain off you know
its me
we go into some place
and all i can do is see the angles
its what i do its what
ive always done i love it
i dont know
some sort of weird irony you know
tess watching me scratch and itch
hey listen you know
the worlds gone nuts and youre
whatd you wanna do
its not attached to the adjacent buildings
the whole house
were just raising it slightly
schumann did it in 64 in venice
and 73 in lstanbul
he only had a crew of six
we cant tiit a house
did it with the leaning tower of pizza
exactly thank you
it took 300 men over two years to do it
theres 30 pylons
we cut them insert the jacks
and crank away
its really our best plan
considering its our only plan
crank for how long
like i said its our only plan
what
oh oh okay hold on
try that
number five im a go
master thieves who practice the long con
live separate lives as civilians
they have legitimate jobs and families
which make them
extremely difficuit to catch
the greatest thief of all time was
without question
gaspar lemarc who either died
in portugal in 1988
or in hong kong in 1996
or hes still alive
we may never know for certain
because lemarc
was never captured or photographed
despite being active for over 50 years
though he left behind a slew
of imitators
only one is worth mentioning
in the same breath as lemarc
the thief we know only
as the night fox
so named for the small onyx figurines
he leaves behind to taunt us
the night fox must be considered
our numberone priority
his string of highprofile crimes are
an embarrassment to our branch
to our entire profession
we need more than traditional resources
to pursue thieves like the night fox
we need to train ourselves to think the
way they think to see what they see
and we should not allow ourselves
to be distracted
im sorry someone just robbed
the van der woude house
what
hi lsabel well we could really use
your help on this one
i hope the scene hasnt
been contaminated
when can i speak to mr van der woude
probably tomorrow hes heavily sedated
we cant figure out how they disabled
the alarm shorted it out somehow
no that would have triggered the system
and damaged the circuits
well then
then i dont know how they got in
they had the code someone other than
the owner must have known it
lmpossible van der woude programmed
the last nine steps of the system
he set it and never left the house again
closed loop redundant servers
titanium encasement
its not bad actually
yeah thanks
do we know each other
i think i saw you yesterday
oh yeah
yeah you were being chased
by the police
chasing me no i dont think so
im quite sure it was you
doesnt say much for the police
no i love rome i love it
but theres an opening at work
the level above me and its
i was thinking i was gonna try out for it
its in amsterdam
my mother has family there so itd be
itd be good
he lifted the whole house
the whole house
the entire house
the entire house
its called a schumann special
named affer this guy a brilliant guy
max schumann
then he did it in lstanbul in 1973
what is it
its where the crossbow boit hit
the crossbow boit
they fired from that rooftop
through this open window
with a crossbow boit from that roof
through that window
thats a very difficuit shot
no it is an impossible shot
until they raised the building
check the pylons theyll be elevated
you know the name max schumann
no
well they do
who
the americans
wait a minute
exactly why would they bring the drill
if they werent planning to use it
what
oh god
what
i dont know
congratulations you are the second person
to crack the van der woude safe tonight
ln arriving second mr ocean
you have joined a long line
of people whove worked hard and risked
a great deal only to get somewhere second
you dont know these people by name
of course because they enter oblivion
you know this word oblivion
it means to be totally forgotten
by everyone forever
and its where you would be now
if it werent for the bellagio heist
how does this guy know who we are
ln a way im responsible for you
coming to amsterdam in the first place
i hired matsui and matsui hired you
thats the guy who dimed us
to benedict
all of them including ocean
yes
i find that hard to believe
and you are
you can call me the night fox
the night fox okay mr night fox
what will this information cost me
dont worry nothing
nothing who do you think youre
dealing with nothing costs nothing
and this information is definitely
worth something
lets just say our interests
are temporarily aligned
how so
well the information is free
but it comes with certain conditions
such as
restraint on your part
restraint thats asking a lot
what else
two weeks to buy themselves
out of trouble
two weeks
i can live with that even if they cant
just out of curiosity
what will you make them pay
for letting them live
everything they stole plus interest
a lot of interest
but didnt your insurance
cover what was stolen
of course
so youre asking them to double
your money
well do you really think thats fair
fair i certainly hope not
so what about the information
okay its on your desk
he was here
around 330 this morning i can tell
who
the night fox
go down to the dampkring
and pick up a guy called matsui
real name lan nicolas mcnally
the night fox was here at the same time
as the americans why
thats what were gonna find out
what is he doing
get him out of there
god
hello frank
i cant understand what we did
to this guy
why does he have it out for us like this
how did he get that code

of course youve been seeing
plenty of me havent you
i like this one
i call it thief à la mode
schumann special huh
i guess thats what i get
for opening my mouth
so what about the night fox
did he leave you a message
what about the figurine
you still have it
i suppose its a compliment in a way
i guess hes threatened by you
though i cant imagine why
you have no idea what youre up against
the french police
think hes better than lemarc
well he is french
let me give you some advice
find out how you offended him
apologize beg for mercy
got to go
any message for frank
hes been hanging around the station
on what charge
well we found a print of a size 14
hitec magnum boot at the crime scene
and
bought with a fraudulent credit card
from that point on well theres only one
maybe two great nail salons in amsterdam
and you lied to us
yeah and to me
well frank knew
frank knew you were in touch
i wasnt in touch
i was more like keeping tabs
shes a cop
detective actually
whered she learn all that schumann crap
dad

nobody looks at them
nobody but cops
detectives
youd think shed have sympathy for us
if her old man was a thief
ls that sympathy or empathy
no her old man got popped a day
before her 9th birthday died in jail
so i wouldnt count on much sympathy
or empathy
shes gonna have the hotel
under surveillance
great well just eat room service watch
movies and wait for benedict to kill us
whos on the 100 bill
adams

you broke rule number one
and that has consequences
oh you must be talking about
the paintings
dont worry youll be dead in five days
and ill get my paintings back
unless you have an accident first
i dont think so daniel
perhaps i should explain to you
why im tormenting you
id like that
last month i was in portugal
to see my mentor
lemarc
lndeed
a very loud and annoying american
businessman was there the same day
he worked for a big insurance company
hes the one who suggested benedict
to you as a potential mark
you know the man
what about him
he said it was the most
beautiful job hed ever seen
he went on and on about this job
and then he said
it showed you were the greatest
thief in the world
but the worst part is that lemarc
never corrected him
i told lemarc that you cant be
better than me
and he answered that it was impossible
to know for sure
so i thought about that for like
three weeks in a row day and night
and then suddenly i realized that
he was actually right
it is impossible to compare one theft
to the other
so i guess the only way to know
whos the best of us for sure
is to go after the same object
do the same job
dont you think that would be fun
youre being awfully cavalier with a lot of
peoples lives so you can play out a game
youre gonna regret it
come on mr ocean
how are you gonna possibly get
97 million by next wednesday
especially if every safe you crack
between now and then is already empty
whereas if you accept my challenge
and win
i promise ill pay your debt
to benedict
and lemarc will hold my money
in escrow as a guarantee
what are we stealing
the famous fabergé coronation egg
was that your idea or lemarcs
i think he would agree
that its the most appropriate thing
for us to compete over
where is it located
the egg leff paris this morning
on its way to rome
it travels with heavy security and usually
with one or more replicas
sometimes they even show the replicas
without anybody knowing
when the egg goes on display
monday morning
youll have 48 hours to steal it
before your deadlines up
when the deadline passes
and you dont have the egg
lemarc will know whos the best
rustys phone
who is this
nicole whos this
nagel wheres rusty
he said if you called
to say he was at gunthers
gunthers whats that about
did he say something
do you have a message
yes i do tell him this thing is gonna
cost him double what i told him
and tell him i had to go three times
as thin on the layers
and tell him if he wants it tomorrow
it should cost him more than double
and tell him this thing is beautiful
would fool the bloody romanovs
themselves
and tell him im being a nice guy
and tell him he dresses like a gigolo
ls that it
yeah no tell him having
a sexy female assistant
is such a terrible cliché
can i get a coffee or something
thanks just a cappuccino or espresso
well
you call me on saturday
and ask me to come into my office
and sign a 1077
and you cant even tell me
what they are affer
i can come to your house
im leaving for naples in two hours
well talk about this on wednesday
itll be gone by wednesday
what what what will be gone
something worth signing a 1077 for
ryan and his friends
did the bellagio casino heist in 2001
i am telling you this is serious
lf thats true
then we should call the american fbl
no no no
maurizio listen to me
agent lahiri
a 1077 is not a small thing
unless you can tell me what they are affer
there is no point in discussing it
hey
because lemarc stole it in 1980
when 23 others failed
because the night fox is trying to prove
hes better than ryan and his friends
this is ridiculous
you say the egg will be stolen
then you say lemarc already stole it
24 years ago
which one is it
both
what
lemarcs wife made him
put the egg back
when i signed a 1077 for you
on the bulgari case
you requisitioned 30 of my men
for three months and made zero arrests
i wont do it again
first we cannot go at night
the laser grid in the great halls
impossible to beat
nothings impossible
this is impossible
its in constant motion programmed
to improvise randomly
meaning we cant
plan our way through
all right
so its a daytime play
were still short three on the inside
since lsabel made you and yen and danny
we could try a smugglers paradise
it hasnt worked since the 50s
54 actually
whats option two
baby jane squeaky wheel
followed by a numbertwo son
its complicated but its got a high
success rate the only problem is
we cant do it without a grease man
on the inside without yen
well have to risk it
well put him in disguise
1010 i leave the café
proceed west 1011
i enter the secondfloor bathroom
approach the spanish steps
from the south
basher and i enter by the main entrance
i help yen into the ventilation duct
i move reuben to the egg room
i pause in the great hall while
i go to the egg room
1021
yen enters the mainframe room
he cuts power to grid 14a
he radios me i signal linus
i then go to the egg room
i 022
i drop my keys and move reuben
to his mark
i blind camera one
i blind camera two
i blind camera three
camera four
i make the switch
right
i pull to the corner of the main entrance
i meet danny at the steps
we head north 1025
turk and i make the drop
all right really good stuff guys
really good work all right
well pick it up here in an hour
its a slamdunk
great
1045 we all get arrested
you bet
how was toulour
he was predictable
you hear from nagel
hell be here
thats a lot to presume
from a guy like nagel
follow it up
this is lsabel
its johan i just set a 600 meeting
for you with an andre ciment
who says he had four paintings stolen
from his house in lake como
and when was this
sometime friday
hes missing two monets
a turner and a degas
which degas was it
blue dancers
supposedly theres surveillance video
but i havent been able to confirm that yet
it is all about error correction
three thousand separate
translucent digital slivers
instead of the 1000
i thought it would be
thank god it doesnt have to move
recreating the lighting was a pain
its a mixture of tungsten and real light
but i think the color rendition
is pretty damn accurate
batteries are in the base
two minutes maximum
youre good
its good roman youre a genius
i think i am
youd have never got past that grid
thats why youre paying me double
what no no no
you got my message
whos that sexy phone voice early bond
what message
the message i left with
sexy phone voice nicole
on your mobile
got something going
with gunther am i in
okay when did you leave the message
two days ago
she had your phone
she has your
yeah
that means that shes
yeah
well you better
yeah
thats great
i mean
so so whos got my money
who has got my bloody money
jesus
sorry to hear about your mom
she was an amazing
well i thought so at least
she hated you
i shouldve picked up on that
she hated all thieves
no wonder you fought
excuse me
may i have my phone back
no
thats a nice pull by the way
thanks
did you get that tingling sensation
down your spine when you did it
or is that none of my business
you considered a career change
have you
i tried hotels
im better at this
went by the café for some tiramisu
it wasnt the same
whos the night fox
they did something to the eggs
why accept his challenge
because hell lose
and how can you beat him
we cant
youre not making any sense
okay
the bulgari job you pulled with frank
when we were together
i knew it was you
why didnt you say something
why didnt you
robert
i didnt want it to end
you assumed it would
was i wrong
you shouldnt be here
i have a meeting
someone stole a whole bunch
of paintings in lake como
lnteresting any leads
the next time i see you
im arresting you
and ocean and anybody else i recognize
fair enough
ready
right
yes of course i do
my blue dancers my degas
they took it unfortunately
and i really would like
do you have any enemies
anybody out there who would
feel wronged by you
no i cant see anyone
but why you think
you think maybe the thief
is trying to harm me personally now
well i assumed he was after
the paintings themselves
i think its enough
ready
good
i have something you might be
interested in
its a dvd with all the hidden
surveillance cameras i have to my place
its plenty i havent checked it out yet
maybe the thieves have been
careless enough to be photographed
i doubt it this level of thief
but ill take a look
yeah you never know
okay well merci
thank you mademoiselle lahiri
for everything
thank you goodbye goodbye
mademoiselle lahiri
did you get the faxed copy
of the 1077 good

i dont know if shes just confused
or shes really turned the corner
and hates me now
you think i handled this wrong
i was too forceful
i was too american
shes different
maybe youre right
maybe she has moved on
you know i talked to a doctor
about getting that tattoo removed
but given its location
he advised against it
that guy doing potsie is unbelievable
i mean whats this guys problem
hes stitched us up twice in two weeks
all over his ego
its the first decent evening weve
had together in i dont know how long
all right all right
lets just stay on point here
lets go over the list again

lets go over the list again
swinging priest
not enough people
crazy larry
not enough people
soft shoulder
not enough people
bakers dozen
no woman and not enough people
hell in a handbasket
we cant train a cat that quickly
and not enough people
what about tess
what about her
well you know how she
kind of looks like
so what
yeah whats your point
so we do a lookieloo
its a lookieloo with a bundle of joy
a lookieloo with tess
and a bundle of joy
youve gone right out of your tree
my son hes mad
its crazy its italiantelevision crazy
and were still one short
no think about it she can get near the egg
during daylight with half the system down
i mean thats a trifecta
he might be right make the calls
linus caldwell you are not
following the procedures
danny talked about
if terry benedict shows up
something is wrong what is wrong
dannys fine hes with rusty
during this part of the plan
they cant communicate with us
promise he isnt hurt
i promise he isnt hurt
youre gonna miss the deadline
danny would be thrilled if you met him
in rome when the jobs finished
he misses you like crazy
plus you studied art
so i know how much you love rome
theres no downside here
wow theyre bringing you
along fast arent they
yes danny would be more thrilled
if you were on the 7 pm out of jfk
which means you have to leave right now
i thought id requested a midsize
danny here
he wanted to be
did you have a nice flight we werent
sure if you were a window or aisle person
how longs danny been in jail
just a couple of days really
which you know on the bright side
hes completely safe from benedict
he told me everything was fine
he lied right to me
what i think he meant by fine
is were running low on time and money
and were deeper in debt
than when we started
i assume that you have a plan
to get him out
actually she sounds like her
no she needs a southern accent
can you do a southern
what the hell is going on with you guys
not quite the accent is crucial
its the first thing people notice
this ridiculous car what is it doing
okay im sorry
all right im just gonna level with you
due to certain personnel losses
that we have sustained
were various readjustments
had to be made
youre gonna have to play a small role
in this thing
okay so can you put these on
id like you to put this hat on
youre gonna put on that
and youre gonna stuff it with that
and well turn around
just give you a little moment
small role

can we just does she really
need to be rushing this quickly
shes practically jogging
ln thailand
mothers routinely give birth in
rice paddies and then go right back to work
amazing women over there
rice paddy
she will not have it in a rice paddy
shell be at her own paddy
and she will be very comfortable
because she will be strong
from this walk and this exercise
was she worth it
was tess
the moment that she doesnt talk to you
in the restaurant i knew
your friends didnt tell you
no
thats when you figured it out huh
yeah
but the movie was still enjoyable for me
okay thanks
lf everybodys so freaking smart how come

i dont wanna be an annoying fan
but my boyfriend is such a huge fan
i cant let you leave unless you sign
something for him do you mind
thats very unorthodox
sorry it wont take long
whats his name
his names robert
arent you a lefty
i thought you were a lefty
she is a lefty
often pregnant women
become ambidextrous
you are a big fan
she doesnt necessarily
have to sign lefty
oh thanks so much this is great
okay were on the move
thank you you take care now
and one more thing
i just got off the phone
with someone called marcy who put you
on a plane from taos new mexico to la
where you have a 100 meeting
about a film clowns cant sleep
anyway she just wanted me to let you
know everyones running a little late
and was wondering if you could
make it at 130 instead
i knew it
shame on you
i dont think weve met bruce
isabel lahiri nice to meet you
do you really have a boyfriend
or were you just was that just
part of the whole thing with them
so howd it go
you lahiri
im section chief molly starr
i spoke to a very nice man at europol
this morning commissioner greisman
he wants you on the next flight
to amsterdam
there seems to be some irregularity
with your paperwork
that one
lets start with that one
lmagine yourself in a room
thats too short for you to stand up in
and not wide enough for you to lie down in
a room with no light no heat
and stone walls scratched by the teeth
and nails of desperate men
men driven crazy by isolation
you will have rats for company
and a small window that looks out
on the world that has passed you by
your parents will grow old and die
just like your dreams
your friends will forget your name
tell your stories as their own
because what good is a story when
the person who owns it has vanished
what do you want
testify against the others
in the benedict case
the italian charges will be dropped
you and the others will be extradited
to the us this afternoon
plead and you walk with parole
i cant
think about it linus
for a moment there
i was already forgetting your name
wait
just hang on a sec
linus
right thanks
you okay
well i blew the meet with matsui
matsui
let me guess he pulled
a lost in translation on you
thats his idea of fun for firsttimers
i mean how do i not see these things
dont get down on yourself
obvious
we talked about this
i hope danny and rusty appreciate the job
you did in a tight jam i am proud of you
thanks
we both are
you you told dad
i had to sweetheart

dining out on this one for months
hey remember the time your mom

that was for keeping me in the dark
and that that
is for making me a master thief
and that

your fathers alive lzzy
your mom lied to you
to keep you from him hes alive
what are you talking about
when they divorced she told him if he
contacted you shed go to the cops
with everything to put him in jail
how do you know that
and why should i believe you
i dont believe you okay
you know where he is
i know somebody who does
theres nothing back there
but a forged 1077
no really no
no
thatd be horrible
its hard you know for dinners
well you must have very good contacts
i hear it usually takes days
to buy your way out
tess this is françois toulour
madame ocean at last
hello
hes french
shouldnt you be somewhere else
by now like
outer mongolia maybe
well before we get to that
we just wanted to ask you one question
what is that
howd you do it
oh so thats why you came
you wanna know
well i guess thats normal
but i got another deal for you
you both recognize that im the best
and ill tell you my secret
yeah
that
make it if you get him to tell us
and tell him that he is the best
oh okay
i wont tell him because youre the best
all right thank you
all right
well tell you youre the best
after you tell us how you did it
how can i refuse
a dying mans last request
the egg arrived in rome at 645 pm
the saturday before it went on display
it was at the museum by 8 pm
wait a minute hold on
you stole it that evening
with the museum locked down
howd you get in the building
howd you get past the sensors
why didnt my recon team see you
dont touch my thing
i didnt touch your thing like it works
you got greasy hands you put them
on the lens now i cant see
you cant see anything
i see you you look like a retard
you look like a retard
ill pay you a million dollars if you dont
speak for a month one month
i wanna eat your whole head
go ahead a million dollars no joke
right with no equipment no rope
of course come on dont tell me
you dont know how to do that
how did you get by the laser field
in the great hall
the laser fields well
okay toulour youre the best
well thank you danny
good now if you can just
get us our money
well be going
the money
what money
the money that you agreed
to pay benedict if we won
were under a deadline
no no no you dont understand
you didnt win
you lost and not only did you lose
your entire crew got pinched
i gotta tell you something
you dont look anything like her
eventually the nose but the ears
i mean the way you walk
and you dress
that means that you spoke to lemarc
you spoke to lemarc
since im dead i think my involvement
in this should stay among the three of us
of course
absolutely
its ironic that the solution to all of
our problems will be provided by toulour
im sure i provoked him by agreeing with my
american friend that you might be better
i apologize sincerely for the trouble
ive caused you
theres no need
especially now
remember from the time you see toulour
at his villa and the challenge begins
you must assume he will have you
under surveillance everywhere you go
youll have to put on
a very elaborate show
the egg the real egg
will be carried in a backpack
on a train leaving gare du nord
at 930 am
thank you
you saved our lives gaspar
yeah and im still getting
the better of you
and i stole a replica
your paintings are in a highsecurity
warehouse in milan
its 1 via andreotti unit 222
security code is 23116
646 thank you
listen all games aside that was
that was very good

well i told you one story tonight
i think thatll be enough so now

waiting
for what

ls it actually good
its good trust me
i dont trust you and i dont trust ocean
lf its good were done
these grudges theyre awful
nobody wins
dannys had enough of this meshugaas
and the competition
its worse than our business
always some new young punk
trying to prove himself
guys like ocean they keep coming back
they dont like to lose
too much ego too much pride
maybe for some guys but not danny
trust me on that
danny dont feel like he lost in all this
its hard to believe
but thats how he feels
well if he tries anything lf anybody
tries anything ill be waiting
terry i cant predict the future
i pay professionals to do that
and even they get it wrong sometimes
i cant say that nobodyll ever
try to rob from you again
but i can say this lf god forbid
anything does happen to you
we will not be involved
you better not be reuben
you better not be
