hey  audra

 hearing bitches  
and you  you hate people 
we could finally be part
of this community 
we have our community

it s a great idea 
we can t talk to these people 
  breaking rocks in the hot sun

what happened 
you didn t come to work 
we re done fishing 
they suspended my license 
who 
coasties 
the observer saw we were deaf
and tipped them off 
well  they can t do that 
we were just working
and they came to board us 
we didn t know 
i told you 
you need a hearing deckhand 
yeah  that s you 
you were that person 
i can t always be that person 
she s right 
we need another guy 
we can t afford it 
if you d told me you weren t coming 
i d have figured something out 
but you didn t 
you re seriously blaming me 
your father was counting on you 
no  don t put this on me 
it s not my fault 
you failed to obey an order
by federal law enforcement
to board your vessel 
on top of that 
you were operating your vessel
in a negligent and dangerous manner
due to your    disability 
i have no choice but to administer
the minimum fine  which is  1 000 
and an additional penalty of  1 500 
we can t pay that unless
we can get back on the water 
officer  what do they need
to do to be able to fish again 
you will be required
to have a hearing individual
on board at all times
to answer radios 
hear ship whistles  etcetera 
we will be monitoring you regularly
to make sure you are in compliance 
do you have that person 
i ll sell the boat 
take the money we can 
that ll be that 
it s fine 
i ll stay 
i ll work with you on the boat 
no 
yes 
we can t afford to pay someone else 
and there s nobody that s
gonna know how to sign 
are you sure 
school can wait 
i already decided 
i m excited 
oh  saint ruby 
we ll make a shrine to you on the boat 
wait 
she s trying to help 
well  thank god you have her 
don t kill me 
i bought you a red dress for your concert 
if you don t like it 
you don t have to wear it 
i m really glad you re staying 
leo isn t 
it s complicated 
he feels   
left out 
that s crazy 
it s always the three of you
and then me 
i get it 
do you ever wish i was deaf 
when you were born  at the hospital 
they gave you a hearing test 
and there you were  so tiny and sweet 
with these electrodes all over you 
and i   
prayed that you would be deaf 
when they told us
that you were hearing 
i felt   
my heart sank 
why 
i was worried that we wouldn t connect 
like me and my mom 
we re not close 
i thought i would fail you 
that being deaf would make me a bad mom 
don t worry 
you are a bad mom
for so many other reasons 
i know i drive you crazy
with the clothes  the makeup 
but honestly 
i m happy that you know who you are 
you re brave 
not like me 
mmm 
get lost 
you hiding 
not very well 
you still mad at me 
you can t fish full time 
why not 
gertie told me
that you can really sing 
that s special 
you can t stay here 
they ll keep looking to you
for everything 
what else am i supposed to do 
let me do this 
i got this 
i m the older brother 
and i get treated like a baby 
i haven t been able to do a thing
with fresh catch 
because it all involves
talking to hearing people 
so what  who cares 
you re so afraid that we d look stupid 
let them figure out how to deal
with deaf people 
we re not helpless 
our family was fine before you were born 
go 
come on  this is   
we re not at fenway 
ok  guys  you must be ready
to walk onstage in two minutes 
or you re not performing  ok

  they say that life is a circle  
  but that ain t the way that i found it  
  i found it  
  gonna move in a straight line  
  i leaned back on my radio  
  some cat was laying down
some rock and roll  
   lotta soul   he said  
what s wrong 
my buttons are off 
  that weren t no dj  
  that was hazy cosmic jive  
what do you want for dinner 
  spaghetti 
  i ll have to go to the grocery store 
  he d like to come and meet us  
  but he thinks he ll blow our minds  
  there s a starman waiting in the sky  
  he s told us not to blow it  
   cause he knows it s all worthwhile  
   he told me   let the children lose it  
   let the children use it  
  let all the children boogie   
and now i have a special treat 
sometimes  you hear a voice  and
it reminds you to keep making music

  they rain and snow on everyone  
  so many things i would have done  
  but clouds got in my way  
  i ve looked at clouds
from both sides now  
  from up and down  
  and still somehow  
  it s cloud illusions i recall  
  i really don t know clouds  
  at all  
  moons and junes and ferris wheels  
  the dizzy dancing way you feel  
  as every fairy tale comes real  
  i ve looked at love that way  
  but now it s just another show  
  you leave  em laughing when you go  
  and if you care  don t let  em know  
  don t give yourself away  
  i ve looked at love
from both sides now  
  from give and take  
  and still somehow  
  it s love s illusions i recall  
  i really don t know love  
  at all  
  tears and fears and feeling proud  
  to say   i love you   right out loud  
  dreams and schemes and circus crowds  
  i ve looked at life that way  
  but now old friends
they re acting strange  
  they shake their heads
they say i ve changed  
  well  something s lost
but something s gained  
  in living every day  
  i ve looked at life
from both sides now  
  from win and lose  and still somehow  
  it s life s illusions i recall  
  i really don t know life  
  i ve looked at life
from both sides now  
  from up and down  and still somehow  
  it s life s illusions i recall
