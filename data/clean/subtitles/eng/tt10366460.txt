why is no one answering the radio
nailed it
no

no no
check it out
yeah yeah yeah

what happened
you didnt come to work
were done fishing
they suspended my license
who
coasties
the observer saw we were deaf
and tipped them off
well they cant do that
we were just working
and they came to board us
we didnt know
i told you
you need a hearing deckhand
yeah thats you
you were that person
i cant always be that person
shes right
we need another guy
we cant afford it
if youd told me you werent coming
id have figured something out
but you didnt
youre seriously blaming me
your father was counting on you
no dont put this on me
its not my fault
you failed to obey an order
by federal law enforcement
to board your vessel
on top of that
you were operating your vessel
in a negligent and dangerous manner
due to your disability
i have no choice but to administer
the minimum fine which is 1000
and an additional penalty of 1500
we cant pay that unless
we can get back on the water
officer what do they need
to do to be able to fish again
you will be required
to have a hearing individual
on board at all times
to answer radios
hear ship whistles etcetera
we will be monitoring you regularly
to make sure you are in compliance
do you have that person
ill sell the boat
take the money we can
thatll be that
its fine
ill stay
ill work with you on the boat
no
yes
we cant afford to pay someone else
and theres nobody thats
gonna know how to sign
are you sure
school can wait
i already decided
im excited
oh saint ruby
well make a shrine to you on the boat
wait
shes trying to help
well thank god you have her
dont kill me
i bought you a red dress for your concert
if you dont like it
you dont have to wear it
im really glad youre staying
leo isnt
its complicated
he feels
left out
thats crazy
its always the three of you
and then me
i get it
do you ever wish i was deaf
when you were born at the hospital
they gave you a hearing test
and there you were so tiny and sweet
with these electrodes all over you
and i
prayed that you would be deaf
when they told us
that you were hearing
i felt
my heart sank
why
i was worried that we wouldnt connect
like me and my mom
were not close
i thought i would fail you
that being deaf would make me a bad mom
dont worry
you are a bad mom
for so many other reasons
i know i drive you crazy
with the clothes the makeup
but honestly
im happy that you know who you are
youre brave
not like me
mmm
get lost
you hiding
not very well
you still mad at me
you cant fish fulltime
why not
gertie told me
that you can really sing
thats special
you cant stay here
theyll keep looking to you
for everything
what else am i supposed to do
let me do this
i got this
im the older brother
and i get treated like a baby
i havent been able to do a thing
with fresh catch
because it all involves
talking to hearing people
so what who cares
youre so afraid that wed look stupid
let them figure out how to deal
with deaf people
were not helpless
our family was fine before you were born
go
come on this is
were not at fenway
ok guys you must be ready
to walk onstage in two minutes
or youre not performing ok
ruby

i got the music in me
they say that life is a circle
but that aint the way that i found it
i found it
gonna move in a straight line
i leaned back on my radio
some cat was laying down
some rock and roll
lotta soul he said
whats wrong
my buttons are off
that werent no dj
that was hazy cosmic jive

ill have to go to the grocery store
hed like to come and meet us
but he thinks hell blow our minds
theres a starman waiting in the sky
hes told us not to blow it
cause he knows its all worthwhile
he told me let the children lose it
let the children use it
let all the children boogie
and now i have a special treat

it reminds you to keep making music

ive looked at clouds that way
but now they only block the sun
they rain and snow on everyone
so many things i would have done
but clouds got in my way
ive looked at clouds
from both sides now
from up and down
and still somehow
its cloud illusions i recall
i really dont know clouds
at all
moons and junes and ferris wheels
the dizzy dancing way you feel
as every fairy tale comes real
ive looked at love that way
but now its just another show
you leave em laughing when you go
and if you care dont let em know
dont give yourself away
ive looked at love
from both sides now
from give and take
and still somehow
its loves illusions i recall
i really dont know love
at all
tears and fears and feeling proud
to say i love you right out loud
dreams and schemes and circus crowds
ive looked at life that way
but now old friends
theyre acting strange
they shake their heads
they say ive changed
well somethings lost
but somethings gained
in living every day
ive looked at life
from both sides now
from win and lose and still somehow
its lifes illusions i recall
i really dont know life
ive looked at life
from both sides now
from up and down and still somehow
its lifes illusions i recall
i really dont know life

run off with some cello player
who wears a fedora
yeah probably
ready
