thanks 
you know  i m from new crown 
grey  like you 
went to hellier high 
so what do you have 
okay 
i know you were anxious
to come down here
and see how
we re getting things done 
and i think that s great 
i m a face to face
person myself 
you know 
i don t pilot these drones 
i like to get my hands dirty 
  bang on doors 
  grey  so who are these guys 
we don t know yet 
i do have a list of people
of interest in that area 
and just this week 
i brought in two people
  for questioning 
  so what you re saying
is you have all these things
flying above our heads 
they can read the id chips
in our fillings 
but they don t actually
do anything 
no  i    i mean  yes  they work 
but it s not that simple 
criminals can find ways
around them 
if they can find
the right people 
criminals can get a firewall
built around them
that prevents our drones
from identifying their faces 
believe me  i understand
your frustration  i do 
i know i can t tie
my shoes anymore  detective 
but you don t have
to talk to me
like i m a goddamn
three year old 
grey  she s just trying
to help 
i m going to work
through my list 
and if you want to work with me 
we re gonna find them 
how can i work with you 
i can t even stand 
 dramatic theme playing 
grey  administer p m  medicine

again 
administer p m  medicine 
problem  again

kara  i cannot administer
any more medication  grey 
no  you    you didn t do it
right 
you didn t do   
you didn t do it right 
administer p m  medicine 
kara  another dosage
could be fatal 
i will contact an ambulance
to transport you
to a hospital
if you are in serious pain 
 ekg beeping 
not gonna give you
bird flu  kid 
i don t leave my house
very often 
must be frustrating for you 
you re someone who liked to get
things done with their hands 
now you can t 
i m sorry 
was that inappropriate 
i m not around enough people
to know the difference 
okay  here s the difference 
what the fuck do you want  eron 
 footsteps passing by 
grey   
what if i told you
i could offer you something
that would enable you
to walk again 
that computer chip
that i showed you 
it has the potential to change
everything for people
in your condition 
as a quadriplegic 
the line connecting your brain
to your limbs has been cut 
stem would bridge that gap 
the operation would take
place in my home 
away from official eyes 
there d be no more
hospitals 
but it would have to be
our secret   
for now 
here s the thing  kid 
i m not looking to restart
my life 
i m looking
for the off switch 
you know   
you were right about them 
computers 
there are things
that they can t do 
they can t bring her back  grey 
but they just might be able
to bring you back 
what would she want 
 dramatic theme playing

eron  this is a world first 
never before
has a biomechanical fusion
been asked to do so much 
it s going to feel strange
initially 
the neural pathways
in your brain
will be trying
to have a conversation
with a foreign body 
trying to learn to pass
the baton 
the key is to let it grow
into itself 
gordon  muffled  
grey  can you hear me 
can you feel it when i do this 
my guess is this is gonna be
a piecemeal process 
you shouldn t be expecting
unreasonable results so soon 
oh  my god 
now  try to stand 
 dramatic theme playing 
eron  nobody can know 
they make people like me
wait years
to test something like this 
but i can t wait for them 
signing confidentiality
agreements is never fun 
but i bet it will feel good
to do it
with your own hand 
who s moving my arms
and my legs 
me or your widget 
you re the one doing it all 
you re not a robot 
stem works in service
of your brain 
your brain gives stem
a command

i can t remember
every single thing
that i touched here   
stem  i have a record
of every single thing
you touched 
bhatia 
so  the body that came in
from new crown yesterday 
serk brantner 
i wanna show you what i found
when i opened him up 
when i examined the wound
in his throat 
i found wiring embedded
in the tendons 
i m thinking surgery 
a medical implant attached
to the muscle 
i also found computer implants
all throughout his chest 
i ve never seen them
to this extent before 
  and then there s this 
  what is it 
appears to be some sort
of weapon implant
embedded within the muscle 
an actual functioning gun 
with a bullet loading mechanism
built into the tissue
with biomechanics 
what about the boot print
we scraped
from the front porch 
engine grease  mostly 
old fashioned engine grease 
 dramatic theme playing 
so how am i progressing 
i can track you  grey 
  huh 
  i can track you 
grey  wait  am i supposed
to know what that means
or is that
one of your brain tests 
it means you have a piece
of my property
inside of you 
a very expensive piece
of property 
serk brantner 
homicide suspect list 
did you really think
i would let that property
out of my sight
for even one second 
 suspenseful music playing 
did you forget
that this operation
was to be done in secret 
that if even the slightest thing
were to go wrong
during this trial period 
it would all be for nothing 
stem  he knows everything 
don t lie to him 
cortez 
search drone footage archives 
alley behind 414 citrus avenue 
new crown 
october 14th  3 00 p m 
grey 
no  i didn t forget it 
i remembered that you asked me
to keep a secret 
but it turns out
that you had a couple
other secrets 
like  for instance 
you never mentioned to me   
that the thing talks 
 suspenseful music playing 
stem   
  talks to you 
  yeah  it s got a mind
of its own 
i can hear its voice
in my head 
 suspenseful music playing 
eron  from now on 
you will be a model patient 
you will let the computer do
what it was supposed to do 
not confuse it
with some extracurricular
detective work 
enter suspect named grey trace 
202 parva avenue  leland park 
eron  did it occur to you
that if you were to  say 
commit murder 
the authorities
could find out about stem
and remove him from your body 
putting you back
in a wheelchair for life 
cortez  i m actually off duty
right now 
i just stopped by
to check up on you 
and because i m in the market
for a new car 
i knew you fixed these things up
and sold them
to people like eron keen 
now  he makes
a little more money than i do 
but i was wondering
if you d be willing to sell
to one of the little people 
well  what makes you think
that i don t need
my car anymore 
 laughs 
stem  she just checked
the sole of your boots 
  you left a print 
  grey  well  i hate to break it
to you  but it s not for sale 
sorry 
okay 
listen  when i said i didn t
have any news earlier 
i kind of lied 
there was this guy we brought in
for questioning about
asha s murder 
a man with
a long criminal record
who lived in the area 
he didn t pan out  but   
yesterday he was murdered 
really 
cortez  yeah  did you hear
anything about that 
stem  don t look away 
you re showing her
you re lying 
no 
but you were in new crown
yesterday 
i saw you on a drone camera 
right around the time
that it happened 
stem  she s guessing 
you have no computer implants
and i can t be identified
by a drone 
well i was in the area 
detective 
because  remember  you did say
you wanted my help  so i was   
i m just trying to help 
right 
grey  you re not seriously
suggesting
that i had anything to do
with this 
  are you  detective 
   cortez scoffs 
grey  i mean  because i got
a pretty solid alibi here 
  if you haven t noticed 
  obviously 
i m not accusing you
of doing something
you re incapable of doing 
it s just  uh 
strange that you were
at that location
at that time is all 
yeah  well 
i don t know what to tell you 
i mean  um 
look you could stab me
in the leg if you wanna   
if you wanna see
for yourself 
maybe i will 
 chuckles 
just for fun 
 laughs 
is that all  or    
yeah 
but call me if you  uh 
change your mind about selling 
i won t 
 laughs 
well  then i ll see myself out 
 door closes 
what should i do 
i wanna find these guys 
but i don t wanna kill
anybody else  okay 
stem  the old bones would seem
the next logical place
to investigate 
but i can find
no online information for it 
you would have to go there
in person 
but if you do that 
eron will track your movements
and most likely attempt
to shut me down remotely 
 dramatic theme playing 
stem 
this place looks dangerous 
we ll need a plan 
 heavy metal music playing
over speakers 
grey  whiskey  rocks  please 
stem  this doesn t seem like
a well thought out plan 
grey 
hey  would you do me a solid
and hold that glass
where i can drink it 
thank you 
stem  alcohol impairs
the signals from your brain 
you will not be able
to walk properly 
i know 
that s why
they can charge money for it 
stem  it does not make sense
that humans deliberately
malfunction 
grey  yeah  that s because
your memories are filled
with ones and zeros  pal 
and our memories are filled
with every fuck up
we ve ever made 
hi  everybody 
excuse me  can i have
everybody s attention 
 music shuts off 
i know that some scumbag
in here knows
one of the guys
who murdered my wife 
his name s serk brantner 
so  if you know serk
or if you know
any information about
the killing of my wife 
if you could you just raise
your hand and 
you know 
stand up and come forward 
thank you 
 crowd laughing 
 tolan laughing and clapping 
so you knew serk 
okay 
have it your way  cock snot 
  i ll call the police 
   scoffs 
grey
