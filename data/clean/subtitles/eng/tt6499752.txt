thanks
you know im from new crown
grey like you
went to hellier high
so what do you have
okay
i know you were anxious
to come down here
and see how
were getting things done
and i think thats great
im a facetoface
person myself
you know
i dont pilot these drones
i like to get my hands dirty
bang on doors
grey so who are these guys
we dont know yet
i do have a list of people
of interest in that area
and just this week
i brought in two people
for questioning
so what youre saying
is you have all these things
flying above our heads
they can read the id chips
in our fillings
but they dont actually
do anything
no i i mean yes they work
but its not that simple
criminals can find ways
around them
if they can find
the right people
criminals can get a firewall
built around them
that prevents our drones
from identifying their faces
believe me i understand
your frustration i do
i know i cant tie
my shoes anymore detective
but you dont have
to talk to me
like im a goddamn
threeyearold
grey shes just trying
to help
im going to work
through my list
and if you want to work with me
were gonna find them
how can i work with you
i cant even stand

ekg beeping
not gonna give you
bird flu kid
i dont leave my house
very often
must be frustrating for you
youre someone who liked to get
things done with their hands
now you cant

im not around enough people
to know the difference
okay heres the difference
what the fuck do you want eron
footsteps passing by
grey
what if i told you
i could offer you something
that would enable you
to walk again
that computer chip
that i showed you
it has the potential to change
everything for people
in your condition
as a quadriplegic
the line connecting your brain
to your limbs has been cut
stem would bridge that gap
the operation would take
place in my home
away from official eyes
thered be no more
hospitals
but it would have to be
our secret
for now
heres the thing kid
im not looking to restart
my life
im looking
for the off switch
you know
you were right about them
computers
there are things
that they cant do
they cant bring her back grey
but they just might be able
to bring you back
what would she want
dramatic theme playing
seagulls squawking
ekg continues beeping
eron this is a world first
never before
has a biomechanical fusion
been asked to do so much
its going to feel strange
initially
the neural pathways
in your brain
will be trying
to have a conversation
with a foreign body
trying to learn to pass
the baton
the key is to let it grow
into itself
gordon muffled
grey can you hear me
can you feel it when i do this
my guess is this is gonna be
a piecemeal process
you shouldnt be expecting
unreasonable results so soon
oh my god
now try to stand
dramatic theme playing
eron nobody can know
they make people like me
wait years
to test something like this
but i cant wait for them
signing confidentiality
agreements is never fun
but i bet it will feel good
to do it
with your own hand
whos moving my arms
and my legs
me or your widget
youre the one doing it all
youre not a robot
stem works in service
of your brain
your brain gives stem
a command
he makes it happen

stem i have a record
of every single thing
you touched
bhatia
so the body that came in
from new crown yesterday
serk brantner
i wanna show you what i found
when i opened him up
when i examined the wound
in his throat
i found wiring embedded
in the tendons
im thinking surgery
a medical implant attached
to the muscle
i also found computer implants
all throughout his chest
ive never seen them
to this extent before
and then theres this
what is it
appears to be some sort
of weapon implant
embedded within the muscle
an actual functioning gun
with a bulletloading mechanism
built into the tissue
with biomechanics
what about the boot print
we scraped
from the front porch
engine grease mostly
oldfashioned engine grease
dramatic theme playing
so how am i progressing
i can track you grey
huh
i can track you
grey wait am i supposed
to know what that means
or is that
one of your brain tests
it means you have a piece
of my property
inside of you
a very expensive piece
of property
serk brantner
homicide suspect list
did you really think
i would let that property
out of my sight
for even one second
suspenseful music playing
did you forget
that this operation
was to be done in secret
that if even the slightest thing
were to go wrong
during this trial period
it would all be for nothing
stem he knows everything
dont lie to him
cortez
search drone footage archives
alley behind 414 citrus avenue
new crown
october 14th 300 pm
grey
no i didnt forget it
i remembered that you asked me
to keep a secret
but it turns out
that you had a couple
other secrets
like for instance
you never mentioned to me
that the thing talks
suspenseful music playing
stem
talks to you
yeah its got a mind
of its own
i can hear its voice
in my head
suspenseful music playing
eron from now on
you will be a model patient
you will let the computer do
what it was supposed to do
not confuse it
with some extracurricular
detective work
enter suspect named grey trace
202 parva avenue leland park
eron did it occur to you
that if you were to say
commit murder
the authorities
could find out about stem
and remove him from your body
putting you back
in a wheelchair for life
cortez im actually offduty
right now
i just stopped by
to check up on you
and because im in the market
for a new car
i knew you fixed these things up
and sold them
to people like eron keen
now he makes
a little more money than i do
but i was wondering
if youd be willing to sell
to one of the little people
well what makes you think
that i dont need
my car anymore
laughs
stem she just checked
the sole of your boots
you left a print
grey well i hate to break it
to you but its not for sale
sorry
okay
listen when i said i didnt
have any news earlier
i kind of lied
there was this guy we brought in
for questioning about
ashas murder
a man with
a long criminal record
who lived in the area
he didnt pan out but
yesterday he was murdered
really
cortez yeah did you hear
anything about that
stem dont look away
youre showing her
youre lying
no
but you were in new crown
yesterday
i saw you on a drone camera
right around the time
that it happened
stem shes guessing
you have no computer implants
and i cant be identified
by a drone
well i was in the area
detective
because remember you did say
you wanted my help so i was
im just trying to help
right
grey youre not seriously
suggesting
that i had anything to do
with this
are you detective
cortez scoffs
grey i mean because i got
a pretty solid alibi here
if you havent noticed
obviously
im not accusing you
of doing something
youre incapable of doing
its just uh
strange that you were
at that location
at that time is all
yeah well
i dont know what to tell you
i mean um
look you could stab me
in the leg if you wanna
if you wanna see
for yourself
maybe i will
chuckles
just for fun
laughs
is that all or
yeah
but call me if you uh
change your mind about selling
i wont
laughs
well then ill see myself out
door closes
what should i do
i wanna find these guys
but i dont wanna kill
anybody else okay
stem the old bones would seem
the next logical place
to investigate
but i can find
no online information for it
you would have to go there
in person
but if you do that
eron will track your movements
and most likely attempt
to shut me down remotely
dramatic theme playing
stem
this place looks dangerous
well need a plan
heavy metal music playing
over speakers
grey whiskey rocks please
stem this doesnt seem like
a wellthoughtout plan
grey
hey would you do me a solid

where i can drink it
thank you
stem alcohol impairs
the signals from your brain
you will not be able
to walk properly
i know
thats why
they can charge money for it

that humans deliberately
malfunction
