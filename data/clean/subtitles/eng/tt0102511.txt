you want you want
i ran out
you ran out oh thats nice
its impossible you run out
whatd you do eat the stuff
the chink shortchanged me
no glot come fliday
its funny its actual very
funny what you just said
ran out
they can either paint it
or draw it or write it down
and then pass it on to somebody
they read what youre saying
and then they reexperience
thats the only connection
you have with that
so you cant rewrite
cause to rewrite is to deceive and lie
and you betray your own
thoughts to rethink the flow
and the rhythm and the tumbling
out of the words is a betrayal
and its a sin martin its a sin
i dont accept your
catholic interpretation
of my compulsive necessity to rewrite
every single word at
least a hundred times
guilt is thanks
guilt is the key not sin
guilt re not writing
the best that i can
guilt re not considering everything
from every possible angle
balancing everything
how about guilt re
censoring your best thoughts
your most honest
primitive real thoughts
because thats what your laborious
rewriting amounts to martin
is rewriting really censorship bill
because im completely fucked if it is
exterminate all rational thought
that is the conclusion i have come to
what is the man talking
about im being serious
so is he
so how is the extermination
business going there bill
somebodys stealing my roach
powder somebodys got it in for me
bill maybe you should
take it as a sign
maybe you ought to try your
hand at writing pornography
yeah a novel a week at 120
bucks its serious money
i can connect you with the guy
were thinking of
collaborating on one ourselves
i gave up writing when i was 10
too dangerous
only if someone reads what you write
so far we havent had that problem
ive found my profession im an exterminator
of course bill
thats just what the world needs
more literate exterminators
give me a cigarette
of course then you know
youre gonna have trouble
if you cant keep track
of your roach powder
wait a minute do you boys
know something about this
we dont exactly know anything
no but we suspect
its a domestic problem
my god what are you doing
you werent supposed to see this
well now that im
seeing it what is it
im shooting up your bug powder
you might like to try it
yourself or you might not
i ran out in the middle of a job
you gotta stop using the stuff joan
they ration it out like snakebite serum
just do what everybody else
does cut it with baby laxative
the roaches will shit
themselves to death
its the best job i ever had
if i run out again im finished
its
its a very literary
high very literary
is that why hank and
martin know all about it
we all just tried it
togetherspur of the moment thing
they didnt like it i did
what do you mean its a literary high
its a kafka high you feel like a bug
try some
well i dont know
i dont know
i think our metabolisms
are very different
whose yours and kafkas
i thought you were finished
with doing weird stuff
i thought i was too
but i guess im not
personally i prefer a
pyrethrum job to a fluoride
with the pyrethrum you
kill the roaches right there
in front of god and the client
whereas this starch and fluoride
leave it around the roaches eat it
come back a few days later
theyre running around fat as hogs
and there it is bill you
want to put on some weight
you gotta switch from that
yellow powder diet of yours
to some of this good
fluoride stuff right here
sure works for the chink
hes healthy enough
you see him scarf that poison down
he doesnt really eat
it its sleight of hand
the hell he doesnt
been breathing in the powder so
long it just makes him laugh
just like them roaches
william lee
what is this
hes hauser im obrien
city narcotics were gonna
take you downtown bill
little matter of possession
of a dangerous substance
youve got quite a record bill
a lot of drugs poured down the old vein
i was a troubled person then
im married now got a good job
thats good bill thats nice
whats this then
thats my job i use it to kill bugs
he says it kills bugs
he could be right
id like to see it
me too id like to see it too
well gee
id like to demonstrate
but i already got rid of
that last case of crabs i had
very funny bill
but you know
i think we got a bug around here somewhere
youre right
lets see if that yellow
stuff will kill it
well be back later to see
how it worked out kiddo

william lee i have arranged all this
just to have a moment alone with you
i am your case officer
my what
case officer
you are my agent i in turn
report to your controller
come come mr lee you dont
have to play dumb with me
that would be foolish wouldnt it
it would
say bill do you think you could rub
some of this powder on my lips
yeah

well now as you might have expected
i have instructions
for you from control
its about the little woman
the what
the little woman your little woman
your wife
tell me
your wife is not really your wife
she is an agent of
interzone incorporated
you must kill her kill joan lee
it must be done soon this week
and it must be done real tasty
interzone incorporated
an organization based in interzone
a notorious free port on
the north african coast
a haven for the mongrel
scum of the earth
an engorged parasite on
the underbelly of the west
i cant see it why would a
classy american woman like joan
ever want to work for a twobit
outfit like interzone incorporated
but who says joan lee is really a woman
in fact who says shes human at all
what do you mean by that
i can say no more
hey where you going dont
do it therell be hell to pay
weve been made we
gotta get out of town
wait a minute
whats going on
i got busted for bug powder
i started hallucinating
behind the stuff
god knows what i really
said to those two flatfeet
im not even sure how
i got out of there
did you bring back
tomorrows bug powder
did you bill did you
my god joan youre acting
like a fullfledged junkie
and its bug powder for christs sake
i do have a little bit
of a habit yes hon
you ought to at least give me
a few marks for originality
how did you know it
just wouldnt kill you
i dont know bill
i felt drawn to it you know
like you feel drawn to an old lover
say bill
could you rub some of
this powder on my lips
could you bill
please
hey
bill
where were you this morning
we missed you at the automat
i got in a bit of a jam
i misplaced the gear
in a manner of speaking
we heard about it
we saw you go off
with the heat in fact
they wont give it back to
cohen its evidence they say
yeah its an embarrassment yes
is that why you tried to lift mine
thats unkind edwardlift is unkind
im doing a job for a friend
the centipedes edward
the centipedes are getting
down right arrogant
theyre starting to attack his children
take it from me bill
youre not the first one to
develop a bug powder problem
see this man
hell help ya
dr a benway general practitioner
bug powder
you mean pyrethrum
yes
i get a lot of you folks
in the extermination trade
you better help this friend of
yours get off the yellow stuff
itll kill him
how do i get him to kick
kick
how do i get him off it
mix it with this
gradually increase the percentage
of black without telling your friend
and hell lose his taste for
the bug powder soon enough
what is it what does it do
its all natural
its made from aquatic
brazilian centipede
or some such outlandish thing
it shuts down the brains response
to the bug powder thats all
the powder becomes
irrelevant to the addict
and the addict then
ceases to be addicted
side effects
nothing that will surprise the addict
but i before i do your cure
ive gotta score some bug powder
score
youre not trying to pull a
fast one on the old doctor are you
i came here for help
of course you did
my god
it smells like a tainted cheese
youll see how elegantly this works
the black will disappear completely
and therell be no
smell no discoloration
its like an agent
an agent whos come to
believe his own cover story
but whos in there
hiding in a larval state
just waiting for the
proper moment to hatch out
centipedes
followers of obsolete
unthinkable trades
doodling in etruscan
addicts of drugs not yet synthesized
black marketeers of world war iii
excisors of telepathic sensitivity
osteopaths of the spirit
investigators of
infractions denounced
by bland paranoid chess players
servers of fragmentary
warrants taken down
in hebephrenic shorthand
charging unspeakable
mutilations of the spirit
officials of unconstituted
police states broke
hi bill
say why dont you and i join them
hank and i were just
bored it wasnt serious
i didnt take it
seriously where is hank
he got embarrassed and left
not before he came i hope
hanks on junk he doesnt come
not before you came i hope
im on bug powder i dont need to come
officials of unconstituted
police states
brokers of exquisite
dreams and nostalgias
tested on the sensitized
cells of junk sickness
and bartered for raw
materials of the will
drinkers of the heavy fluid sealed
in translucent amber of dreams
i guess its about time for
our william tell routine
oh god
joan
oh joan
are you a faggot
not by nature no
im not
i wouldnt say
faggot no
however circumstances
have forced me to consider
the possibility that
id like you to meet a friend of mine
he specializes in sexual ambivalence
sexual ambulance did you say
my god
hes called mugwump
no point in feigning surprise
you knew we would be
getting in touch with you
why else would you come to
a waterfront dive like this
why else
i suggest a clark nova portable
it has mythic resonance
clark nova a typewriter
you suggest it for what
for your report from
interzone of course
handwriting is not
considered professional
interzone
my report
and dont leave out any of the tasty details
the small red hole in the forehead
or the look of astonishment on her face
listen to me youre just
gonna have to leave town
and interzone is the only place
thatll have a shady character
like you at such short
notice take this
take what what is that
your ticket to interzone
tourist class im afraid
but what can you expect these days
well contact you there
its commie trash and its
been fired very recently
you use it in a holdup
i want that typewriter in the
window i want the portable
this plus
8 you got any ammo to go with it
thesell cover the state tax
bill
martin
listen i told the police it was
a drunken accident that i saw it
so at least thats on the
record theyre after you though
theyre saying that
you escaped from custody
and murdered your
wife and they want you
id better lie low till my ship sails
you booked passage somewhere already
sure look got my ticket
put this away for gods sake bill
ill send you a report
youll send me a report
ill send you a copy of the report
are you gonna be all right
i hear interzones really
nice this time of year
he woke up in bed to find himself wedged
between a dutch transvestite
and six arab men
clark nova very nice
for writing reports
i use a krups dominator myself
company policy
youre american correct
you know dr benway
i am interested in selling a
large stash of the black meat
verstehen sie the
sundried powdered black meat
of the giant aquatic
brazilian centipede
and
for some reason
i am certain that you are working
for herr dr benway
im sorry i apparently
mistook you for somebody else
but as it happens mr lee
i am among other things a provider
of rare services to the arts
and in my experience as a provider
of rare services to the arts
i have found that writers are
a particularly needy group
is there nothing i can
provide for you mr lee
a very professional operation
as you can see mr lee
you like a taste
id be happy to join you in a taste
if youre planning to have one
you can understand that if you were
a purchasing agent for a foreign power
how it would be to my advantage
to impress you with the cleanliness
and the sincerity of our operation
you mentioned a dr
benway
benway
benway correct
yes
does he qualify as a foreign power
oh but yes hes very foreign
may i
yes
lee wake up this
is no time to doze off
like a freckledface
boy on a fishing raft
whats up
now now bill no need for that
you didnt think wed
abandon you did ya
no the thought never occurred to me
good we like confidence in an agent
but dont let it make you careless
i was i was just in the
process of configuring my report
thats good lee admirable
but there have been some changes
changes at the top
oh yeah
good changes bill fresh
blood sparkling insights
bill could you do me a favor
what
i want you to type a few words into me
words that ill dictate to ya
yeah
sure what the hell
okay now the first sentence is
homosexuality is the
best allaround cover
an agent ever had
come on bill
dont be such a pansy be forceful
hurt me
i love it that is a great sentence
these are words to live by bill
im glad these words are
going into your report
our new management will be so pleased
that you see our point of view
what point of view
well just that we
appreciate that you might find
the thought of engaging
in homosexual acts
morally and possibly even
physically repulsive
and we are encouraged
that you are able to overcome
these personal barriers
to better serve the cause to
which we are all so devoted
you have left the clark nova at home
its doing all right without me
and
you have contacted dr benway
i told you before i never met the man
bill i can smell him on you
benway marks out all
those whom he has met
like a lemur pissing on a liana
vine to mark his territory
youre a marked man bill
joanie
joanie shall we go
yes yes
hans hans that couple
who are they
they are tom and joan frost
americans who have lived
here a very long time
theyre both writers
writers of fiction like you
they live in a nice flat
in the new building at
the foot of the mountain
theyre visited constantly
by many handsome
young interzone men sometimes
two or three at a time
can you introduce me
i do not think it would
be to your advantage
for some reason
that woman has taken a
serious dislike to me
kiki come sit with us
kiki this is mr lee
hello
mr lee is curious
about the frost couple
he would like to meet them
i think the woman would
have sex with you mr lee
the man he only likes interzone boys
i dont want to fuck em
i just want to talk to em
you know how americans are
kiki they love to travel
and then they only want
to meet other americans
and talk about how hard it
is to get a decent hamburger
theres a party tonight
at the oleary place
frost will be meeting a group of us here
and then walking through the casbah
my friends and i would be
happy to take you with us
youre the new writer arent
you youve just arrived
a few days ago i write reports
oh and did you come to
interzone for the boys
no i didnt
tom and i did
thats quite a hot
threesome you arrived with
theyre very cheap and
theyre really a lot of fun
you use a clark nova dont you
to write with typewriter
i do yes
i wouldnt use a clark
nova myself too demanding
demanding
oh come on were both writers
we know what were talking about
well im new to this
game to tell you the truth
if i get blocked again ill
let you try my martinelli
her inventiveness will surprise you
i cant wait
they say you murdered
your wife is that true
who told you that
word gets around
it wasnt murder it was an accident
there are no accidents
for example
ive been killing my own wife
slowly over a period of years
what
well not intentionally
i mean on the level of conscious
intention its insane monstrous
but you do consciously know it you
just said it were discussing it
not consciously
this is all happening telepathically
nonconsciously
what do you mean
if you look carefully
at my lips youll realize
that im actually saying something else
im not actually telling
you about the several ways
im gradually murdering joan
about the housekeeper fadela whom
ive hired to make joan deathly ill
by witchcraft
about the medicines and
drugs ive given her
about the constant nibbling away
at her selfesteem and sanity
that ive managed without
being at all obvious about it
whereas joanie finds
that she simply cannot be
as obsessively precise
as she wants to be
unless she writes
everything in longhand
look
im afraid
im not gonna be very
good company tonight
thanks for the invite i think
ill have to take a rain check
enjoying the beach
i would never have expected
to see you up and out so early
you certainly were in rough shape
at the oleary party last night
was i
you were very raw emotionally i mean
you seemed to be in a lot of pain
i dont remember pain
in fact i dont remember
the oleary party
in fact i dont remember you
it was a very intense
performance in any case
my names cloquet
yves cloquet
can i buy you breakfast
ive seen you around but i
had no idea you were queer
queer
i saw you arrive with those three interzone boys
what an entrance you all looked very
familiar with each other
queer
a curse been in our
family for generations
the lees have always been perverts
i shall never forget
the unspeakable horror
that froze the lymph in my glands
when the baneful word
seared my reeling brain
i
was a homosexual
i thought of the painted
simpering female impersonators
i had seen in a baltimore nightclub
could it be possible i was
one of those subhuman things
i walked the streets in a daze
like a man with a light concussion
i would have destroyed myself
but a wise old queen
bobo we called her
taught me that i had a duty
to live and to bear my
burden proudly for all to see
poor bobo came to a sticky end
he was riding in the duc
de ventres hispanosuiza
when his falling hemorrhoids
blew out of the car
and wrapped around the rear wheel
he was completely gutted
leaving an empty shell
sitting there on the
giraffeskin upholstery
even the eyes and the brain went
with a horrible schlupping sound
the duke says he will carry
that ghastly schlup with
him to his mausoleum
you sound as if you could use a drink
my place
a drink
a drink
no
no i cant i gotta go
home i have a i have a
i have a report to write excuse me
you made a big hit with
our young friend yves
yves
cloquet
yves said you were wonderfully funny
said you did a little
routine that made him
chuckle to himself all day
yes you could
you could probably get him into
bed if you worked at it a bit
deadly aphrodisiac humor
im not i dont really
have you seen hans around
you mean you havent heard
no i havent heard
hans was arrested and deported two weeks ago
deported
they let him take his
clothes and his passport
that was it everything else
nationalized as they say
why
he neglected to pay the right officials i think
you knew he ran a drug
factory in the medina
what
what drug did he manufacture
nothing too exotic
majoun i think its a
local hash resinalmond paste
youd spread it on a
muffin like jam try it
while youre at it why
dont you try my martinelli
take her now
try her out
holy shit that machine doesnt
belong to me its tom frosts
my god lee
surely you know better than to bring
an enemy agent into your own home
you gave me no choice
you were giving her access to
your innermost vulnerabilities
forcing them on her for gods sake
but what am i gonna tell him
whats your assessment of the situation
did frost know that his
machine was an interzonal agent
he and his wife appear
to have a close connection
with the indigenous population here
his wife yeah yeah of course
the key is joan frost
you will seduce her and you will
discover the substance of her report
and deliver it directly to me
seduce her but what about
kiki and the interzone boys
my cover
itll work beautifully bill
the opposition will be
thrown into total confusion
toms gone out with the boys
i came to see you
theres a great restaurant in
new york looks just like this
oh really
you write in longhand
yes
im not good with machines
they intimidate me
i think i broke toms typewriter
the martinelli
hell be furious
does he have another one
yes he has that one the
mujahideen its arabic
does he use it much
not much
what happened to the martinelli
i probably just threw it
on the floor and smashed it
probably you dont know
i suffer from
sporadic hallucinations
join the club
do you intend to kill toms mujahideen
only in selfdefense
i understood writing could be dangerous
i didnt realize the danger
came from the machinery
what are you talking about
ill show you
are you gonna write something in arabic
no you are
i dont like using toms things
we dont trespass on each other
do you have any objection
to trying some of this
i cant read it is it erotic
its fairly erotic
kind of uncivilized
more erotic
filthier
filthier okay all you think about
ooh this is very good
joan oh joan
mrs frost this is an evil and
insane thing that you are doing
you must stop it at once
pull up your hair
whos that
my housekeeper
its my mujahideen
for gods sake
it jumped of its own accord
you did see that didnt you
joan are you all right what happened
fadela stormed in here
and she threw your
typewriter out the window
thats it the woman has to go
she certainly seemed deadly to me
i knew it
look tom look
this is how fadelas been
controlling you joan
your blood your pubic
hair your fingernails
fadela controls nobody and you know it
we have forced control upon her
poor womans probably desperate
to get out of our household
no missus shes making
you say everything
even that
you must find all of these in
your house you must destroy them
bill im going to need my martinelli
i feel desperately insecure
without a typewriter in the house
yes i havent had a chance
to try it out yet tom
i was kind of hoping
ill leave hafid here with you
joanie in case fadela comes back
bill and i will go to his place
and pick up the martinelli now
ill go with bill you two
stay here i need to get out
fadelas within 30 feet of
us see if you can find her
there shes right there
that thing shes cutting up
have you ever seen that before
no looks like some kind
of sea creature i think
all those women they work for her
in a sense theyre all fadelas lovers
im going to have to
im gonna have to stay here
with fadela do penance
ive been instructed to reveal to you
that you were programmed to
shoot your wife joan lee
it was not an act of
free will on your part
hey
who the fuck asked ya
you worry me bill you
cause me many anxious moments
oh gee i hope youre
not losing any sleep
no need to be nasty bill
there was some thought
that you might actually want
to hear this information
that it might assuage your guilt
save the psychoanalysis for
your grasshopper friends
you have to admit it was
a pretty tasty setup bill
joan marries you as part of
her agents cover not realizing
that you were the very enemy
agent assigned to kill her
as elegant as it is brilliant
wait a minute
youre saying that joan was sent by
interzone incorporated to marry me
yeah in fact she was sent to you
by fadela who was her controller
we did a lot of groundwork
to set you up in their files
as the prime candidate for marriage
and it didnt matter that i
didnt know anything about it
an unconscious agent is
an effective agent bill
the situation does generate
some ethical paradoxes at times
im the first to admit that
when you bugs first approached me
one of your associates suggested
that joan was possibly not human
what did he mean by that
women arent human bill
or perhaps more precisely theyre
a different species from men
with different wills and
different purposes on earth
you know this instinctively bill
and its your instincts that
make you such a good operative
im talking about joan
if joan lee wasnt human
what was she
well joan was a special case
joan was an elitecorps centipede
joan was a centipede
wheres my martinelli
jesus tom are you nuts
dont fuck with me lee
i want my typewriter
a lot of people have tried to
silence me all have failed
tom
shes here
in pieces
i fear its hopeless
all right were taking your clark nova
hafid the bag
whats going on here
wait wait this is a
heinous mistake youre making
lee do something stop them
hes got a gun clark nova
you dont want to lose
your best agent do ya
youre gonna have to
write a full report lee
and i mean full
how am i gonna write it in longhand
will you take this sack
off this is insubordination
youre all gonna pay for
this heads are gonna roll
your days in interzone
are numbered lee
i suggest you give up the writing game
make tracks for another
part of the world
fuck em all squares on both sides
i am the only complete
man in the industry
bill
bill
i must be hallucinating
what are you cats doing here
were here to see you bill come on
its probably the first time
you havent been
hallucinating in a long time
what are you talking
about what are you saying
naturally ive had a few odd moments
everybody blacks out in
interzone wouldnt you
definitely
sure
whats in the pillowcase bill
these are the remains of
my last writing machine
its been a big problem for me
mind if i take a look
go ahead
wait a minute where are we going
oh man
how about back to your place
nope
why not
im not safe there
im a dead duck there
well protect you
you boys are kidding yourselves
youre babes in the woods here
what do you suggest
we thought it was important for us
to help you get your book together
yeah ive sent sections of it to
my publisher and theyre interested
all you gotta do is finish it
youve already done the hard part
book my book
yeah the one youve
been calling naked lunch
where did you put that
bradley the buyer routine
did you find it all
yeah its on the sofa
right next to the
hassans rumpus room riff
its all right there
i never saw those pages before
i truly do suspect some
sort of colossal con
someones planted these
pages in your room right
somebody sent all those letters to me
and signed them with your name right
a wellorchestrated
cabal could easily manage
all of these simple things children
when will you learn
theyve done you a
favor cause this stuff
is gonna get published under your
name and youll have a career
yeah youll probably get
into print before we will
for gods sake bill play
ball with this conspiracy
youre patronizing me boys
but i dont mind cause
youre so sweet to me too
hey martin listen to this
so we start for new orleans past
iridescent lakes and orange gas flares
and swamps and garbage heaps
alligators crawling around in
broken bottles and tin cans
neon arabesques of motels
marooned pimps scream
obscenities at passing cars
from islands of rubbish
new orleans is a dead museum
so nice
sound familiar bill
first time i ever heard it read on
i think its time to
discuss your philosophy
of drug use as it relates
to artistic endeavor
i think its time to bring
this meeting to order
i think its time for you
boys to share my last taste
of the true black meat
the flesh of the giant
aquatic brazilian centipede
so were still here in
interzone with bill right
thats right
now were gonna travel back to the city right
thats right hank
i think bills on top of
things here dont you
he has a grip on a certain
unique reality principle yes
i think you both should consider
staying here for a few months
everything you could want
is cheap and plentiful here
that reality principle thing
could work for you too
my mothers all alone and
shes kind of sick bill
and besides my books as
allamerican as football
couldnt finish it here
america is not a young land
it is old and dirty and evil
before the settlers before the indians
the evil is there waiting
what about you martin
maybe you can move into my
place what do you think
stay until you finish the
book but then come back to us
youll be okay
yeah dont worry about me
the zone is full of surprises
the zone takes care of its own
william
you look terrible
what are you doing here
i dont know i dont know
i just
my only fr my only
friends in the world
im afraid ill never see em again
im feeling so
severed
come with me take me home
i cant go home i cant go home
is that your typing machine there
foutu
broken beyond repair
if we fix the typing machine
we also fix the life
there you see theres
no cause for despair
in this shop anything can
be fixed that is broken
i dont know kiki
they dont seem to be
capable of delicate work here
you must have faith william
look we have your new writing machine
not bad not bad not bad
i feel very comfortable
working with you
i like that sense of
camaraderie in an agent
you must be progressing
my predecessor felt you had an
ambivalent relationship with him
you mean clark nova
yes
how is he
hes still in the hands of our enemies
such are the hazards of our trade
a hazardous trade yes
your report on the subversive
activities of joan frost
was a model of its type
if you continue to develop
your skills as an operative
i think a top position with
the cia is not out of reach
the cia you really think so
you have the demeanor thats
something you cant buy
the cia
thats a career you can really
sink your teeth into it has
resonance
but giving yourself
over to being a writer
this stuff is very potent
the two are very closely related
so you boys keep telling me
well whats my next assignment
im hungry for adventure
excellent
you know the swiss dandy cloquet
yes
and
i think hes a faggito
and wont admit it
that ought to make it all easier
you will seduce or
otherwise compromise cloquet
we have it on good authority
that hes our conduit to benway
dr benway md
ph d  selfstyled
he never actually made
it through medical school
he runs an interesting little show here
which he calls interzone inc
pretentious if you ask me
benways behind interzone inc
the base of his pyramid is
a drug called the black meat
the pyramids tip
is
well wed like to know
dr benway
of course
yes
and hes obviously
got sensational cover
hes floated in and out
of the zone for years
without anybody
actually ever seeing him
but now the pressures on to place an agent close to him
me
assessments are being made
youre working away william
yes kiki
the machine turns out
to be a very good one
muy simpatico
and i have you to thank for it
and so i will
thank you
im very proud to be
your friend you know
im very proud that i can
help you to be a writer
you have done that
kiki you really have
would you like some tea
that would be lovely william
kiki
do you know cloquet
the swiss man with the big
house on the old valley road
cloquet
oh yes yes yves
with the wonderful car
he has a wonderful car
the most wonderful car
enjoying the ride
im wild about it yes thank you
its good to be wild sometimes
you know i have often thought
of that funny story you told me
the first time we met on the beach
the one about the duc de ventre
at first i didnt know how to take it
i thought you were making a pass at me
did i ever tell you about the man
who taught his asshole to talk
his whole abdomen would
move up and down you dig
farting out the words
it was unlike anything i ever
heard bubbly thick stagnant sound
a sound you could smell
this man worked for
the carnival you dig
and to start with it was like
a novelty ventriloquist act
after a while the ass
started talking on its own
he would go in without anything prepared
and his ass would adlib and toss
the gags back at him every time
then it developed sort of teeth like
little raspy incurving
hooks and started eating
he thought this was cute at first
and built an act around it
but the asshole would eat
its way through his pants
and start talking on the street
shouting out it wanted equal rights
it would get drunk too
and have crying jags nobody loved it
and it wanted to be kissed
same as any other mouth
finally it talked all
the time day and night
you could hear him for blocks
screaming at it to shut up
beating at it with his fists
and sticking candles up it but
nothing did any good and
the asshole said to him
it is you who will shut
up in the end not me
because we dont need
you around here anymore
i can talk and eat and shit
after that he began
waking up in the morning
with transparent jelly like a tad
poles tail all over his mouth
he would tear it off his mouth and
the pieces would stick to his hands
like burning gasoline
jelly and grow there
so finally his mouth
sealed over and the whole head
would have amputated spontaneously
except for the eyes you dig
thats the one thing that the
asshole couldnt do was see
it needed the eyes
nerve connections were blocked
and infiltrated and atrophied
so the brain couldnt
give orders anymore
it was trapped inside
the skull sealed off
for a while you could
see the silent
helpless suffering of
the brain behind the eyes
and then finally the
brain must have died
because the eyes went out
and there was no more feeling in them
than a crabs eye at the end of a stalk
you seem to like my
little friend im so glad
im writing a business piece on
corporate life in north africa
oh my my we are
fragile today arent we
he has to get to know you first
oh does he
well lets see what we can do then
kiki will you come and
see the parrots with me
there are cages in the master bedroom
i dont think i can mr cloquet
that is i dont really want to
id particularly like to
interview a certain dr benway
kiki doesnt seem to find my
parrots attractive anymore
isnt that sad
kiki would love to play
with your parrots yves
but kiki is as anxious to contact
this benway character as i am
fadela the witch who
works for the frosts
she and benway are intimates
you didnt hear it from me
kiki
go see the fucking parrots will
you kiki i gotta take a piss
then ill come and get
you and well go home
pissoirs at the end of the great hall
hello bill whats up
something the matter
you seem distracted
i wish youd say something
i dont like this mood are we going out
youre going out
why dont you just write
something and calm yourself down
youre obviously not in a
professional state of mind
maybe i should write about
your little double cross
you expected me to end up in that
parrot cage with cloquet didnt you
bill are you thinking
of getting rid of me
i think an exchange of hostages
is the only viable scenario
no bill if you get rid of
me you sever ties with reality
for instance take the case
of of the female agent
who forgot her real identity
and merged with her cover story
she is still a fricoteuse in annexia
and incidentally you can make
a square heterosex citizen queer
with this angle using drugs
tom ive brought you a new typewriter
which conveniently dispenses
two types of intoxicating fluids
when it likes what youve written
are you proposing to trade
back for your clark nova
thinking of it
has it written anything
good for you lately
no its too damned
allamerican for my taste
guess ive gone foreign or something
well my mugwriter here is
so foreign its almost alien
youre gonna do your best
work on her guaranteed
hafid
bring the machine in
question for bill will you
and how are you enjoying
your affair with joan
literate complex and
neurotic i would imagine
i havent seen her for weeks
she ran off with fadela and her coven
thats too bad
yes she does that when she
feels attracted to a man
dont give up though its a good sign
with joanie the courtship period
can involve years of
passionate ambivalence
tom i think we should take a
close look at his machine first
test it thoroughly dont you tom
you both have different writing styles
bill lee has always been a man
of powerful instinct hafid
if he says ill do my
best work on his machine
im sure thats prophecy
take the gun too bill
no american should find himself
in a foreign land without a pistol
you wouldnt be trying to
set me up again would you
youve set yourself up already bill
im just trying to give you
a fighting chance thats all
clark nova
clark nova its me
its bill lee clark nova speak to me
youre safe with me now
they tortured me did
unspeakable things to me
im on my last legs the bastards
clark nova where is joan wheres joan
hanss old drug factory in the medina
fadela is there
fadela is your point of
penetration into interzone inc
fadela
what do i do when i find her
youll know what to
do when the time comes
just remember this
all agents defect and
all resisters sell out
thats the sad truth bill
and a writer a writer lives
the sad truth like anyone else
the only difference is
he files a report on it
leave me now before its too late
but wait what about
joan what about joan
go now vaya con dios
clark nova clark nova
hurry hurry
come on
your notes must be much
more carefully detailed
to be of any use to us
you must write very clearly
the effects of the
drugs must be cataloged
with painstaking accuracy
joan
bill
oh bill
what is that what are you writing
im writing
all is lost
all is lost
its all ive ever written
no
oh joan
we have to see fadela
take me to fadela
lee youre here thank god thank god
you see my misdemeanor
has borne sweet fruit
now you are with us
i was right to approach you so brazenly
and now dr benway
will have no choice
benway
benway
youll see
i got to say im proud of you sir
it took you a while but
you got us redhanded
full marks boy full marks
i expected to see an operation
all out for the black meat here
whats with all the mugwump jism
the black meat concession
turns out to have
some unfortunate
political strings attached
weve just cut those strings
from now on interzone is
strictly mugwump territory
as you can see weve
made a flying start here
with our modest dispensary
i can feel the heat
closing in on you fadela
feel them out there making
their moves you dig
fadela
you mean this old thing
benway
we met once before remember stateside
you dont remember
you had that look boy
the look of a sheepkilling dog
decided to recruit
you right on the spot
im afraid i was forced
by the tenor of the times
to prescribe that wretched black
meat powder to start you off on
but the holeinthewall
operation limited resources
you understand the problems
but i understand from cloquet that
youre on to our good stuff now
mugwump jism cant be beat
and as you can see weve got
ourselves a few more friends now
and a few more dollars too
this little fadela number
is something i developed
during my tenure as chief physician
to the prime minister of annexia
el primo liked to walk the streets
amongst his people in drag and
well one thing led to another
its an elegant way to strike
terror into the hearts of the enemy
wouldnt you say
old fadela must be on the rag
shes been acting subversive lately
speaking of new uses for old technology
i think the new order could find
a place for a man of your caliber
a 32 wasnt it
that is what youre here for isnt it
hell i could use a reliable
man to send to annexia
were expanding boy
i need a spearhead
just tell me what you want
i want her
her
that purulent little cunt what for
i cant write without her
bill i feel confident that you
and i can work something out
papers please
what is the purpose of your
visit and what is your profession
i write reports im a writer
and i intend to write
reports on life in annexia
for the citizens of the usa
do you have any proof of what you say
how do we know you are really a writer
i have a writing device
thats not good enough
show us
show you
write something
write something
yes
write something
joan joan
what is it bill are we there yet
almost joan
