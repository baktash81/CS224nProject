  you want  you want 
  i ran out 
you ran out  oh  that s nice 
it s impossible you run out 
what d you do  eat the stuff 
the chink shortchanged me 
no glot  come fliday 
it s funny  it s actual very
funny what you just said 
ran out 
they can either paint it 
or draw it  or write it down
and then pass it on to somebody 
they read what you re saying 
and then they reexperience 
that s the only connection
you have with that 
so you can t rewrite 
 cause to rewrite is to deceive and lie 
and you betray your own
thoughts  to rethink the flow
and the rhythm and the tumbling
out of the words    is a betrayal 
and it s a sin  martin  it s a sin 
i don t accept your
catholic interpretation
of my compulsive  necessity to rewrite
every single word at
least a hundred times 
guilt is    thanks 
guilt is the key  not sin 
guilt re not writing
the best that i can 
guilt re not considering everything
from every possible angle 
balancing everything 
how about guilt re
censoring your best thoughts 
your most honest 
primitive  real thoughts 
because that s what your laborious
rewriting amounts to  martin 
is rewriting really censorship  bill 
because i m completely fucked if it is 
exterminate all rational thought 
that is the conclusion i have come to 
what is the man talking
about  i m being serious 
so is he 
so how is the extermination
business going there  bill 
somebody s stealing my roach
powder  somebody s got it in for me 
bill  maybe you should
take it as a sign 
maybe you ought to try your
hand at writing pornography 
yeah  a novel a week at 120
bucks  it s serious money 
i can connect you with the guy 
we re thinking of
collaborating on one ourselves 
i gave up writing when i was 10 
  too dangerous 
  only if someone reads what you write 
so far we haven t had that problem 
  i ve found my profession  i m an exterminator 
  of course  bill 
that s just what the world needs
more literate exterminators 
give me a cigarette 
of course  then  you know   
you re gonna have trouble
if you can t keep track
of your roach powder 
wait a minute  do you boys
know something about this 
we don t exactly know anything 
no  but we suspect
it s a domestic problem 
  my god  what are you doing 
  you weren t supposed to see this 
well  now that i m
seeing it  what is it 
i m shooting up your bug powder 
you might like to try it
yourself  or you might not 
i ran out in the middle of a job 
you gotta stop using the stuff  joan 
they ration it out like snakebite serum 
just do what everybody else
does  cut it with baby laxative 
the roaches will shit
themselves to death 
it s the best job i ever had 
if i run out again  i m finished 
it s   
it s a very literary
high  very literary 
is that why hank and
martin know all about it 
we all just tried it
together spur of the moment thing 
they didn t like it  i did 
what do you mean  it s a literary high 
it s a kafka high  you feel like a bug 
try some 
well  i don t know 
i don t know 
i think our metabolisms
are very different 
whose  yours and kafka s 
i thought you were finished
with doing weird stuff 
i thought i was  too 
but i guess i m not 
personally    i prefer a
pyrethrum job to a fluoride 
with the pyrethrum you
kill the roaches right there
in front of god and the client
whereas this starch and fluoride   
leave it around  the roaches eat it   
come back a few days later 
they re running around fat as hogs 
and there it is  bill  you
want to put on some weight 
you gotta switch from that
yellow powder diet of yours
to some of this good
fluoride stuff right here 
sure works for the chink 
he s healthy enough 
you see him scarf that poison down 
he doesn t really eat
it  it s sleight of hand 
the hell he doesn t 
been breathing in the powder so
long  it just makes him laugh 
just like them roaches 
william lee 
  what is this 
  he s hauser  i m o brien 
city narcotics  we re gonna
take you downtown  bill 
little matter of possession
of a dangerous substance 
you ve got quite a record  bill 
a lot of drugs poured down the old vein 
i was a troubled person then 
i m married now  got a good job 
that s good  bill  that s nice 
what s this  then 
that s my job  i use it to kill bugs 
  he says it kills bugs 
  he could be right 
  i d like to see it 
  me too  i d like to see it  too 
well  gee 
i d like to demonstrate 
but i already got rid of
that last case of crabs i had 
very funny  bill 
but  you know   
  i think we got a bug around here somewhere 
  you re right 
let s see if that yellow
stuff will kill it 
we ll be back later to see
how it worked out  kiddo 
break a leg 
william lee  i have arranged all this
just to have a moment alone with you 
i am your case officer 
  my what 
  case officer 
you are my agent  i  in turn 
report to your controller 
come  come  mr  lee  you don t
have to play dumb with me 
  that would be foolish  wouldn t it 
  it would 
say  bill    do you think you could rub
some of this powder on my lips 
yeah 
sure 
well  now  as you might have expected
i have instructions
for you from control 
it s about the little woman 
  the what 
  the little woman  your little woman 
  your wife 
  tell me 
your wife is not really your wife 
she is an agent of
interzone incorporated 
you must kill her  kill joan lee 
it must be done soon  this week 
and it must be done real tasty 
interzone incorporated 
an organization based in interzone 
a notorious free port on
the north african coast 
a haven for the mongrel
scum of the earth
an engorged parasite on
the underbelly of the west 
i can t see it  why would a
classy american woman like joan
ever want to work for a two bit
outfit like interzone incorporated 
but who says joan lee is really a woman 
in fact  who says she s human at all 
  what do you mean by that 
  i can say no more 
hey  where you going  don t
do it  there ll be hell to pay 
we ve been made  we
gotta get out of town 
wait a minute 
  what s going on 
  i got busted for bug powder 
i started hallucinating
behind the stuff 
god knows what i really
said to those two flatfeet 
i m not even sure how
i got out of there 
did you bring back
tomorrow s bug powder 
did you  bill  did you 
my god  joan  you re acting
like a full fledged junkie 
and it s bug powder  for christ s sake 
i do have a little bit
of a habit  yes  hon 
you ought to at least give me
a few marks for originality 
how did you know it
just wouldn t kill you 
i don t know  bill 
i felt drawn to it  you know 
like you feel drawn    to an old lover 
say  bill   
could you rub some of
this powder on my lips 
could you    bill 
please 
hey 
bill 
where were you this morning 
we missed you at the automat 
i    got in a bit of a jam 
i misplaced the gear 
in a manner of speaking 
we heard about it 
we saw you go off
with the heat  in fact 
they won t give it back to
cohen  it s evidence  they say 
yeah  it s an embarrassment  yes 
is that why you tried to lift mine 
that s unkind  edward  lift  is unkind 
i m doing a job for a friend 
the centipedes  edward 
the centipedes are getting
down right arrogant 
  they re starting to attack his children 
  take it from me  bill 
you re not the first one to
develop a bug powder problem 
see this man 
he ll help ya 
dr  a  benway  general practitioner 
bug powder 
  you mean pyrethrum 
  yes 
i get a lot of you folks
in the extermination trade 
you better help this friend of
yours get off the yellow stuff 
  it ll kill him 
  how do i get him to kick 
  kick 
  how do i get him off it 
mix it with this 
gradually increase the percentage
of black without telling your friend
and he ll lose his taste for
the bug powder soon enough 
  what is it  what does it do 
  it s all natural 
it s made from  aquatic
brazilian centipede
or some such outlandish thing 
it shuts down the brain s response
to the bug powder  that s all 
the powder becomes
irrelevant to the addict   
and the addict then
ceases to be addicted 
side effects 
nothing that will surprise the addict 
but  i before i do your cure
i ve gotta score some bug powder 
score 
you re not trying to    pull a
fast one on the old doctor  are you 
i came here for help 
of course you did 
my god 
it smells like a    tainted cheese 
you ll see how elegantly this works 
the black will disappear completely 
and there ll be no
smell  no discoloration 
it s like an agent 
an agent who s come to
believe his own cover story 
but who s in there 
hiding in a larval state   
just waiting for the
proper moment to hatch out 
centipedes 
 followers of obsolete 
unthinkable trades   
doodling in etruscan   
addicts of drugs not yet synthesized   
black marketeers of world war iii   
excisors of telepathic sensitivity   
osteopaths of the spirit   
investigators    of
infractions denounced   
by bland  paranoid chess players   
servers of fragmentary
warrants taken down   
in hebephrenic shorthand   
charging unspeakable
mutilations of the spirit   
officials of unconstituted
police states  broke    
hi  bill 
say  why don t you and i join them 
hank and i were just
bored  it wasn t serious 
i didn t take it
seriously  where is hank 
he got embarrassed and left 
not before he came  i hope 
hank s on junk  he doesn t come 
not before you came  i hope 
i m on bug powder  i don t need to come 
 officials of unconstituted
police states   
brokers of exquisite
dreams and nostalgias   
tested on the sensitized
cells of junk sickness   
and bartered for raw
materials of the will   
drinkers of the heavy fluid sealed

i guess it s about time for
our william tell routine 
oh  god 
joan 
oh  joan 
are you a faggot 
not by nature  no 
i m not 
i wouldn t say   
faggot  no 
however  circumstances
have forced me to consider
the possibility that   
i d like you to meet a friend of mine 
he specializes in sexual ambivalence 
sexual ambulance  did you say 
my god 
he s called mugwump 
no point in feigning surprise 
you knew we would be
getting in touch with you 
why else would you come to
a waterfront dive like this 
  why else 
  i suggest a clark nova portable 
it has mythic resonance 
clark nova  a typewriter 
you suggest it for what 
for your report from
interzone  of course 
handwriting is not
considered professional 
interzone 
  my report 
  and don t leave out any of the tasty details 
the small red hole in the forehead
or the look of astonishment on her face 
listen to me  you re just
gonna have to leave town
and interzone is the only place
that ll have a shady character
like you at such short
notice  take this 
take what  what is that 
your ticket to interzone 
tourist class  i m afraid 
but what can you expect these days 
we ll contact you there 
it s commie trash  and it s
been fired very recently 
you use it in a holdup 
i want that typewriter in the
window  i want the portable 
this plus   
8   you got any ammo to go with it 
these ll cover the state tax 
bill 
martin 
listen  i told the police it was
a drunken accident  that i saw it 
so at least that s on the
record  they re after you though 
they re saying that
you escaped from custody
and murdered your
wife  and they want you 
i d better lie low till my ship sails 
you booked passage somewhere already 
sure  look  got my ticket 
put this away  for god s sake  bill 
  i ll send you a report 
  you ll send me a report 
i ll send you a copy of the report 
are you gonna be all right 
i hear interzone s really
nice this time of year 
he woke up in bed to find himself wedged
between a dutch transvestite
and six arab men 
clark nova  very nice
for writing reports 
i use a krups dominator myself 
company policy 
you re american  correct 
you know dr  benway 
i am interested in selling a
large stash of the black meat 
verstehen sie  the
sun dried  powdered black meat
of the giant aquatic
brazilian centipede 
and   
for some reason
i am certain that you are working
for herr dr  benway 
i m sorry  i apparently
mistook you for somebody else 
but as it happens  mr  lee 
i am  among other things a provider
of rare services to the arts
and in my experience as a provider
of rare services to the arts
i have found that writers are
a particularly needy group 
is there nothing i can
provide for you  mr  lee 
a very professional operation 
as you can see  mr  lee 
you like a taste 
i d be happy to join you in a taste 
if you re planning to have one 
you can understand that if you were
a purchasing agent for a foreign power
how it would be to my advantage
to impress you with the cleanliness
and the sincerity of our operation 
  you mentioned a dr   
  benway 
  benway 
  benway  correct 
yes 
does he qualify as a foreign power 
oh  but yes  he s very foreign 
may i 
yes 
lee  wake up  this
is no time to doze off
like a freckled face
boy on a fishing raft 
what s up 
now  now  bill  no need for that 
you didn t think we d
abandon you  did ya 
no  the thought never occurred to me 
good  we like confidence in an agent 
but don t let it make you careless 
i was    i was just in the   
process of configuring my report 
that s good  lee  admirable 
but there have been some changes   
  changes at the top 
  oh  yeah 
good changes  bill  fresh
blood  sparkling insights 
bill  could you do me a favor 
what 
i want you to type a few words into me 
words that i ll dictate to ya 
yeah 
sure  what the hell 
okay  now  the first sentence is 
 homosexuality is the
best all around cover
an agent ever had  
come on  bill 
don t be such a pansy  be forceful 
hurt me 
i love it  that is a great sentence 
these are words to live by  bill 
i m glad these words are
going into your report 
our new management will be so pleased
that you see our point of view 
what point of view 
well  just that we
appreciate that you might find
the thought of engaging
in homosexual acts
morally and possibly even
physically repulsive
and we are encouraged
that you are able to overcome
these personal barriers
to better serve the cause to
which we are all so devoted 
you have left the clark nova at home 
it s doing all right without me 
and   
you have contacted dr  benway 
i told you before i never met the man 
bill  i can smell him on you 
benway marks out all
those whom he has met
like a lemur pissing on a liana
vine to mark his territory 
you re a marked man  bill 
joanie 
joanie  shall we go 
yes  yes 
hans  hans  that couple 
who are they 
they are tom and joan frost 
americans who have lived
here a very long time 
they re both writers 
writers of fiction  like you 
they live in a nice flat
in the new building at
the foot of the mountain 
they re visited constantly
by many handsome 
young interzone men  sometimes   
two or three at a time 
can you introduce me 
i do not think it would
be to your advantage 
for some reason
that woman has taken a
serious dislike to me 
kiki  come sit with us 
kiki  this is mr  lee 
hello 
mr  lee is curious
about the frost couple 
he would like to meet them 
i think the woman would
have sex with you  mr  lee 
the man  he only likes interzone boys 
i don t want to fuck  em 
i just want to talk to  em 
you know how americans are 
kiki  they love to travel
and then they only want
to meet other americans
and talk about how hard it
is to get a decent hamburger 
there s a party tonight
at the o leary place 
frost will be meeting a group of us here
and then walking through the casbah 
my friends and i would be
happy to take you with us 
you re the new writer  aren t
you  you ve just arrived 
a few days ago  i write reports 
oh  and did you come to
interzone for the boys 
  no  i didn t 
  tom and i did 
that s quite a hot
threesome you arrived with 
they re very cheap  and
they re really a lot of fun 
you use a clark nova  don t you 
  to write with  typewriter 
  i do  yes 
i wouldn t use a clark
nova myself  too demanding 
demanding 
oh  come on  we re both writers 
we know what we re talking about 
well  i m new to this
game  to tell you the truth 
if i get blocked again  i ll
let you try my martinelli 
her inventiveness will surprise you 
i can t wait 
they say you murdered
your wife  is that true 
who told you that 
  word gets around 
  it wasn t murder  it was an accident 
there are no accidents 
for example 
i ve been killing my own wife
slowly  over a period of years 
  what 
  well  not intentionally 
i mean  on the level of conscious
intention  it s insane  monstrous 
but you do consciously know it  you
just said it  we re discussing it 
not consciously 
this is all happening telepathically 
  nonconsciously 
  what do you mean 
if you look carefully
at my lips you ll realize
that i m actually saying something else 
i m not actually telling
you about the several ways
i m gradually murdering joan 
about the housekeeper fadela  whom
i ve hired to make joan deathly ill
by witchcraft 
about the medicines and
drugs i ve given her 
about the constant nibbling away
at her self esteem and sanity
that i ve managed without
being at all obvious about it 
whereas joanie finds
that she simply cannot be
as obsessively precise
as she wants to be 
unless she writes
everything in longhand 
look   
i m afraid   
i m not gonna be very
good company tonight 
thanks for the invite  i think
i ll have to take a rain check 
enjoying the beach 
i would never have expected
to see you up and out so early 
you certainly were in rough shape
at the o leary party last night 
was i 
you were very raw  emotionally  i mean 
you seemed to be in a lot of pain 
i don t remember    pain 
in fact  i don t remember
the o leary party 
in fact  i don t remember you 
it was a very intense
performance in any case 
my name s cloquet 
yves cloquet 
can i buy you breakfast 
i ve seen you around  but i
had no idea you were queer 
  queer 
  i saw you arrive with those three interzone boys 
what an entrance  you all looked very   
familiar with each other 
queer 
a curse  been in our
family for generations 
the lees have always been perverts 
i shall never forget
the unspeakable horror
that froze the lymph in my glands
when the baneful word
seared my reeling brain   
i   
was a homosexual 
i thought of the painted 
simpering female impersonators
i had seen in a baltimore nightclub 
could it be possible i was
one of those subhuman things 
i walked the streets in a daze
like a man with a light concussion 
i would have destroyed myself 
but a wise old queen   
bobo  we called her 
taught me that i had a duty
to live and to bear my
burden proudly for all to see 
poor bobo came to a sticky end 
he was riding in the duc
de ventre s hispano suiza
when his falling hemorrhoids
blew out of the car
and wrapped around the rear wheel 
he was completely gutted 
leaving an empty shell
sitting there on the
giraffe skin upholstery 
even the eyes and the brain went
with a horrible  schlupping  sound 
the duke says he will carry
that ghastly schlup with
him to his mausoleum 
you sound as if you could use a drink 
my place 
a drink 
a drink 
no 
no  i can t  i gotta go
home  i have a    i have a   
i have a report to write  excuse me 
you made a big hit with
our young friend yves 
  yves 
  cloquet 
yves said you were wonderfully funny 
said you did a little
routine that made him
chuckle to himself all day 
yes  you could   
you could probably get him into
bed if you worked at it a bit 
deadly aphrodisiac  humor 
i m not    i don t really   
have you seen hans around 
you mean you haven t heard 
  no  i haven t heard 
  hans was arrested and deported two weeks ago 
deported 
they let him take his
clothes and his passport 
that was it  everything else
nationalized  as they say 
  why 
  he neglected to pay the right officials  i think 
you knew he ran a drug
factory in the medina 
what   
  what drug did he manufacture 
  nothing too exotic 
majoun  i think  it s a
local hash resin almond paste 
you d spread it on a
muffin like jam  try it 
while you re at it  why
don t you try my martinelli 
take her now 
try her out 
holy shit  that machine doesn t
belong to me  it s tom frost s 
my god  lee   
surely you know better than to bring
an enemy agent into your own home 
you gave me no choice 
you were giving her access to
your innermost vulnerabilities
forcing them on her  for god s sake 
but what am i gonna tell him 
what s your assessment of the situation 
did frost know that his
machine was an interzonal agent 
he and his wife appear
to have a close connection
with the indigenous population here 
his wife  yeah  yeah  of course 
the key is joan frost 
you will seduce her  and you will
discover the substance of her report
and deliver it directly to me 
seduce her  but what about
kiki and the interzone boys 
  my cover 
  it ll work beautifully  bill 
the opposition will be
thrown into total confusion 
  tom s gone out with the boys 
  i came to see you 
there s a great restaurant in
new york looks just like this 
oh  really 
  you write in longhand 
  yes 
i m not good with machines 
they intimidate me 
  i think i broke tom s typewriter 
  the martinelli 
  he ll be furious 
  does he have another one 
yes  he has that one  the
mujahideen  it s arabic 
  does he use it much 
  not much 
what happened to the martinelli 
i probably just threw it
on the floor and smashed it 
probably  you don t know 
i suffer from   
sporadic hallucinations 
join the club 
do you intend to kill tom s mujahideen 
only in self defense 
i understood writing could be dangerous 
i didn t realize the danger
came from the machinery 
  what are you talking about 
  i ll show you 
  are you gonna write something in arabic 
  no  you are 
i don t like using tom s things 
we don t trespass on each other 
do you have any objection
to trying some of this 
i can t read it  is it erotic 
it s    fairly erotic 
  kind of uncivilized 
  more erotic 
  filthier 
  filthier  okay  all you think about 
ooh  this is very good 
joan  oh  joan   
mrs  frost  this is an evil and
insane thing that you are doing 
you must stop it at once 
pull up your hair 
who s that 
my housekeeper 
it s my mujahideen 
for god s sake 
it jumped of its own accord 
you did see that  didn t you 
joan  are you all right  what happened 
fadela stormed in here 
and she threw your
typewriter out the window 
that s it  the woman has to go 
she certainly seemed deadly to me 
i knew it 
look  tom  look 
this is how fadela s been
controlling you  joan 
your blood  your pubic
hair  your fingernails 
fadela controls nobody  and you know it 
we have forced control upon her 
poor woman s probably desperate
to get out of our household 
no  missus  she s making
you say everything 
even that 
you must find all of these in
your house  you must destroy them 
bill  i m going to need my martinelli 
i feel desperately insecure
without a typewriter in the house 
yes  i haven t had a chance
to try it out yet  tom 
i was kind of hoping 
i ll leave hafid here with you 
joanie  in case fadela comes back 
bill and i will go to his place
and pick up the martinelli now 
i ll go with bill  you two
stay here  i need to get out 
fadela s within 30 feet of
us  see if you can find her 
there  she s right there 
that thing she s cutting up   
have you ever seen that before 
no  looks like some kind
of sea creature  i think 
all those women    they work for her 
in a sense  they re all fadela s lovers 
i m going to have to 
i m gonna have to stay here
with fadela    do penance 
i ve been instructed to reveal to you
that you were programmed to
shoot your wife  joan lee 
it was not an act of
free will on your part 
hey 
who the fuck asked ya 
you worry me  bill  you
cause me many anxious moments 
oh  gee  i hope you re
not losing any sleep 
no need to be nasty  bill 
there was some thought
that you might actually want
to hear this information 
that it might assuage your guilt 
save the psychoanalysis for
your grasshopper friends 
you have to admit  it was
a pretty tasty setup  bill 
joan marries you as part of
her agent s cover  not realizing
that you were the very enemy
agent assigned to kill her 
as elegant as it is brilliant 
wait a minute 
you re saying that joan was sent by
interzone incorporated to marry me 
yeah  in fact  she was sent to you
by fadela  who was her controller 
we did a lot of groundwork
to set you up in their files
as the prime candidate for marriage 
and it didn t matter that i
didn t know anything about it 
an unconscious agent is
an effective agent  bill 
the situation does generate
some ethical paradoxes at times 
i m the first to admit that 
when you bugs first approached me 
one of your associates suggested
that joan was possibly not human 
what did he mean by that 
women aren t human  bill 
or perhaps more precisely  they re
a different species from men
with different wills and
different purposes on earth 
you know this instinctively  bill
and it s your instincts that
make you such a good operative 
i m talking about joan 
if joan lee wasn t human 
what was she 
well  joan was a special case 
joan was an elite corps centipede 
joan was a centipede 
  where s my martinelli 
  jesus  tom  are you nuts 
don t fuck with me  lee 
i want my typewriter 
a lot of people have tried to
silence me  all have failed 
tom 
she s here
in pieces 
i fear it s hopeless 
all right  we re taking your clark nova 
hafid  the bag 
what s going on here 
wait  wait  this is a
heinous mistake you re making 
  lee  do something  stop them 
  he s got a gun  clark nova 
you don t want to lose
your best agent  do ya 
you re gonna have to
write a full report  lee 
  and i mean full 
  how am i gonna write it  in longhand 
will you take this sack
off  this is insubordination 
you re all gonna pay for
this  heads are gonna roll 
your days in interzone
are numbered  lee 
i suggest you give up the writing game 
make tracks for another
part of the world 
fuck  em all  squares on both sides 
i am the only complete
man in the industry 
bill 
bill 
i must be hallucinating 
what are you cats doing here 
we re here to see you  bill  come on 
it s probably the first time
you haven t been
hallucinating in a long time 
what are you talking
about  what are you saying 
naturally  i ve had a few odd moments 
everybody blacks out in
interzone  wouldn t you 
  definitely 
  sure 
what s in the pillowcase  bill 
these are the remains of
my last writing machine 
it s been a big problem for me 
  mind if i take a look 
  go ahead 
wait a minute  where are we going 
  oh  man 
  how about back to your place 
  nope 
  why not 
i m not safe there 
i m a dead duck there 
we ll protect you 
you boys are kidding yourselves 
  you re babes in the woods here 
  what do you suggest 
we thought it was important for us
to help you get your book together 
yeah  i ve sent sections of it to
my publisher  and they re interested 
  all you gotta do is finish it 
  you ve already done the hard part 
book  my book 
yeah  the one you ve
been calling naked lunch 
where did you put that
bradley the buyer routine 
  did you find it all 
  yeah  it s on the sofa
right next to the
hassan s rumpus room riff 
  it s all right there 
  i never saw those pages before 
i truly do suspect some
sort of colossal con 
someone s planted these
pages in your room  right 
somebody sent all those letters to me
and signed them with your name  right 
a well orchestrated
cabal could easily manage
all of these simple things  children 
when will you learn 
they ve done you a
favor   cause this stuff
is gonna get published under your
name  and you ll have a career 
yeah  you ll probably get
into print before we will 
for god s sake  bill  play
ball with this conspiracy 
you re patronizing me  boys   
but i don t mind   cause
you re so sweet to me  too 
hey  martin  listen to this 
 so we start for new orleans past 
iridescent lakes and orange gas flares
and swamps and garbage heaps   
alligators crawling around in
broken bottles and tin cans   
neon arabesques of motels   
marooned pimps scream
obscenities at passing cars
from islands of rubbish 
new orleans is a dead museum  
so nice 
sound familiar  bill 
first time i ever heard it  read on 
i think it s time to
discuss your philosophy
of drug use as it relates
to artistic endeavor 
i think it s time to bring
this meeting to order 
i think it s time for you
boys to share my last taste
of the true black meat 
the flesh of the giant
aquatic brazilian centipede 
so we re still here in
interzone with bill  right 
  that s right 
  now we re gonna travel back to the city  right 
that s right  hank 
i think bill s on top of
things here  don t you 
he has a grip on a certain
unique reality principle  yes 
i think you both should consider
staying here for a few months 
everything you could want
is cheap and plentiful here 
that reality principle thing
could work for you  too 
my mother s all alone  and
she s kind of sick  bill 
and besides  my book s as
all american as football 
couldn t finish it here 
america is not a young land 
it is old    and dirty and evil 
before the settlers  before the indians 
the evil is there waiting 
what about you  martin 
maybe you can move into my
place  what do you think 
stay until you finish the
book  but then come back to us 
you ll be okay 
yeah  don t worry about me 
the zone is full of surprises 
the zone takes care of its own 
william 
you look terrible 
what are you doing here 
i don t know  i don t know 
i just   
my only fr    my only
friends in the world 
i m afraid i ll never see  em again 
i m feeling so   
severed 
come with me  take me home 
i can t go home  i can t go home 
is that your typing machine there 
foutu 
broken    beyond repair 
if we fix the typing machine
we also fix the life 
there  you see  there s
no cause for despair 
in this shop  anything can
be fixed that is broken 
i don t know  kiki 
they don t seem to be
capable of delicate work here 
you must have faith  william 
look  we have your new writing machine 
not bad  not bad  not bad 
i feel very comfortable
working with you 
i like that sense of
camaraderie in an agent 
you must be progressing 
my predecessor felt you had an
ambivalent relationship with him 
  you mean clark nova 
  yes 
how is he 
he s still in the hands of our enemies 
  such are the hazards of our trade 
  a hazardous trade  yes 
your report on the subversive
activities of joan frost
was a model of its type 
if you continue to develop
your skills as an operative
i think a top position with
the c i a  is not out of reach 
the c i a   you really think so 
you have the demeanor  that s
something you can t buy 
the c i a 
that s a career you can really
sink your teeth into  it has   
resonance 
but giving yourself
over to being a writer   
this stuff is very potent 
the two are very closely related 
so you boys keep telling me 
well  what s my next assignment 
  i m hungry for adventure 
  excellent 
you know the swiss dandy cloquet 
  yes 
  and 
i think he s a faggito
and won t admit it 
that ought to make it all easier 
you will seduce or
otherwise compromise cloquet 
we have it on good authority
that he s our conduit to benway 
  dr  benway  m d  
ph  d     self styled 
he never actually made
it through medical school 
he runs an interesting little show here
which he calls interzone  inc 
pretentious  if you ask me 
benway s behind interzone  inc  
the base of his pyramid is
a drug called the black meat 
  the pyramid s tip   
  is 
well  we d like to know 
dr  benway 
  of course 
  yes 
and he s obviously
got sensational cover 
he s floated in and out
of the zone for years
without anybody
actually ever seeing him 
  but now the pressure s on to place an agent close to him 
  me 
assessments are being made 
  you re working away  william 
  yes  kiki 
the machine turns out
to be a very good one 
muy simpatico 
and i have you to thank for it
and so i will 
thank you 
i m very proud to be
your friend  you know 
i m very proud that i can
help you to be a writer 
you have done that 
kiki  you really have 
  would you like some tea 
  that would be lovely  william 
kiki 
do you know cloquet 
the swiss man with the big
house on the old valley road 
cloquet 
oh  yes  yes  yves
with the wonderful car 
he has a wonderful car 
the most wonderful car 
enjoying the ride 
i m wild about it  yes  thank you 
it s good to be wild sometimes 
you know  i have often thought
of that funny story you told me
the first time we met on the beach 
the one about the duc de ventre 
at first i didn t know how to take it 
i thought you were making a pass at me 
did i ever tell you about the man
who taught his asshole to talk 
his whole abdomen would
move up and down  you dig 
farting out the words 
it was unlike anything i ever
heard  bubbly  thick  stagnant sound 
a sound you could smell 
this man worked for
the carnival  you dig 
and to start with it was like
a novelty ventriloquist act 
after a while  the ass
started talking on its own 
he would go in without anything prepared
and his ass would ad lib and toss
the gags back at him every time 
then it developed sort of teeth like
little raspy incurving
hooks and started eating 
he thought this was cute at first
and built an act around it   
but the asshole would eat
its way through his pants
and start talking on the street
shouting out it wanted equal rights 
it would get drunk  too 
and have crying jags  nobody loved it 
and it wanted to be kissed 
same as any other mouth 
finally  it talked all
the time  day and night 
you could hear him for blocks 
screaming at it to shut up 
beating at it with his fists
and sticking candles up it  but   
nothing did any good  and
the asshole said to him 
 it is you who will shut
up in the end  not me 
because we don t need
you around here anymore 
i can talk and eat and shit  
after that  he began
waking up in the morning
with transparent jelly like a tad
pole s tail all over his mouth 
he would tear it off his mouth and
the pieces would stick to his hands
like burning gasoline
jelly and grow there 
so  finally  his mouth
sealed over and the whole head
would have amputated spontaneously
except for the eyes  you dig 
that s the one thing that the
asshole couldn t do was see 
it needed the eyes 
nerve connections were blocked
and infiltrated and atrophied 
so  the brain couldn t
give orders anymore 
it was trapped inside
the skull    sealed off 
for a while  you could
see    the silent 
helpless suffering of
the brain behind the eyes 
and then finally the
brain must have died
because the eyes went out
and there was no more feeling in them
than a crab s eye at the end of a stalk 
you seem to like my
little friend  i m so glad 
i m writing a business piece on
corporate life in north africa 
oh  my  my  we are
fragile today  aren t we 
  he has to get to know you first 
  oh  does he 
well  let s see what we can do  then 
kiki  will you come and
see the parrots with me 
there are cages in the master bedroom 
i don t think i can  mr  cloquet 
that is  i don t really want to 
i d particularly like to
interview a certain dr  benway 
kiki doesn t seem to find my
parrots attractive anymore 
isn t that sad 
kiki would love to play
with your parrots  yves 
but kiki is as anxious to contact
this benway character as i am 
fadela  the witch who
works for the frosts 
she and benway are    intimates 
you didn t hear it from me 
kiki 
go see the fucking parrots  will
you  kiki  i gotta take a piss 
then i ll come and get
you  and we ll go home 
pissoir s at the end of the great hall 
hello  bill  what s up 
something the matter 
you seem distracted 
i wish you d say something 
  i don t like this mood  are we going out 
  you re going out 
why don t you just write
something and calm yourself down 
you re obviously not in a
professional state of mind 
maybe i should write about
your little double cross 
you expected me to end up in that
parrot cage with cloquet  didn t you 
bill  are you thinking
of getting rid of me 
i think an exchange of hostages
is the only viable scenario 
no  bill  if you get rid of
me you sever ties with reality 
for instance  take the case
of    of the female agent
who forgot her real identity
and merged with her cover story 
she is still a fricoteuse in annexia 
and incidentally  you can make
a square  heterosex citizen queer
with this angle using drugs   
tom  i ve brought you a new typewriter
which conveniently dispenses
two types of intoxicating fluids
when it likes what you ve written 
are you proposing to trade
back for your clark nova 
thinking of it 
has it written anything
good for you lately 
no  it s too damned
all american for my taste 
guess i ve gone foreign or something 
well  my mugwriter here is
so foreign  it s almost alien 
you re gonna do your best
work on her  guaranteed 
hafid 
bring the machine in
question for bill  will you 
and how are you enjoying
your affair with joan 
literate  complex and
neurotic  i would imagine 
i haven t seen her for weeks 
  she ran off with fadela and her coven 
  that s too bad 
yes  she does that when she
feels attracted to a man 
don t give up though  it s a good sign 
with joanie the courtship period
can involve years of
passionate ambivalence 
tom  i think we should take a
close look at his machine first 
test it thoroughly  don t you  tom 
you both have different writing styles 
bill lee has always been a man
of powerful instinct  hafid 
if he says i ll do my
best work on his machine 
i m sure that s prophecy 
take the gun  too  bill 
no american should find himself
in a foreign land without a pistol 
you wouldn t be trying to
set me up again  would you 
you ve set yourself up already  bill 
i m just trying to give you
a fighting chance  that s all 
clark nova 
clark nova  it s me 
it s bill lee  clark nova  speak to me 
you re safe with me now 
they tortured me  did
unspeakable things to me 
i m on my last legs  the bastards 
clark nova  where is joan  where s joan 
hans s old drug factory in the medina 
fadela is there 
fadela is your point of
penetration into interzone  inc 
fadela 
what do i do when i find her 
you ll know what to
do when the time comes 
just remember this   
all agents defect and
all resisters sell out 
that s the sad truth  bill 
and a writer    a writer lives
the sad truth like anyone else 
the only difference is   
he files a report on it 
leave me now  before it s too late 
but wait  what about
joan  what about joan 
go now  vaya con dios 
clark nova  clark nova 
hurry  hurry 
come on 
your notes must be much
more carefully detailed
to be of any use to us 
you must write very clearly 
the effects of the
drugs must be cataloged
with painstaking accuracy 
joan 
bill 
oh  bill 
what is that  what are you writing 
i m writing   
 all is lost 
all is lost  
it s all i ve ever written 
no 
oh  joan 
we have to see fadela 
take me to fadela 
lee  you re here  thank god  thank god 
you see  my misdemeanor
has borne sweet fruit 
now you are with us 
i was right to approach you so brazenly 
and now dr  benway
will have no choice   
  benway 
  benway 
you ll see 
i got to say i m proud of you  sir 
it took you a while  but
you got us red handed 
full marks  boy  full marks 
i expected to see an operation
all out for the black meat here 
what s with all the mugwump jism 
the black meat concession
turns out to have
some unfortunate
political strings attached 
we ve just cut those strings 
from now on  interzone is
strictly mugwump territory 
as you can see  we ve
made a flying start here
with our modest dispensary 
i can feel the heat
closing in on you  fadela 
feel them out there making
their moves  you dig 
fadela 
you mean this old thing 
benway 
we met once before  remember  stateside 
you don t remember 
you had that look  boy 
the look of a    sheep killing dog 
decided to recruit
you right on the spot 
i m afraid i was forced
by the tenor of the times
to prescribe that wretched black
meat powder to start you off on   
but the hole in the wall
operation  limited resources   
you understand the problems 
but i understand from cloquet that
you re on to our good stuff now 
mugwump jism can t be beat 
and as you can see  we ve got
ourselves a few more friends now 
and a few more dollars  too 
this little    fadela number
is something i developed
during my tenure as chief physician
to the prime minister of annexia 
 el primo  liked to walk the streets
amongst his people in drag  and   
well  one thing led to another 
it s an elegant way to strike
terror into the hearts of the enemy 
wouldn t you say 
old fadela must be on the rag 
she s been acting subversive lately 
speaking of new uses for old technology 
i think the new order could find
a place for a man of your caliber 
a 32  wasn t it 
that is what you re here for  isn t it 
hell    i could use a reliable
man to send to annexia 
we re expanding  boy 
i need a spearhead 
just tell me what you want 
i want her 
her 
that purulent little cunt  what for 
i can t write without her 
bill  i feel confident that you
and i can work something out 
papers  please 
what is the purpose of your
visit and what is your profession 
i write reports  i m a writer
and i intend to write
reports on life in annexia
for the citizens of the u s a 
do you have any proof of what you say 
how do we know you are really a writer 
  i have a writing device 
  that s not good enough 
show us 
  show you 
  write something 
  write something 
  yes 
write something 
joan  joan 
what is it  bill  are we there yet 
almost  joan
