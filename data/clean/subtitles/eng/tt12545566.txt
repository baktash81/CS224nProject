over our parting 
you must promise
to write to me every week 
i promise

i will try 
but i cannot guarantee
a regular correspondence 
once i m out in society 
i will be far too busy 
and you really think
i can visit you
in london one day 
of course 
after i ve fallen in love
and made myself
a proper match

 narrator 
the biggest catch of the season
in the year of our lord 1818
was the
honorable jeremy malcolm 
 twas true he had
no title of his own
and was only
a younger son of an earl 
but his maternal aunt
had left him the bulk
of her sizable fortune
and a large country estate
in kent 
 debutante 
i heard he was out
with emilia james last 
but tonight 
i heard julia thistlewaite 
mr  malcolm was searching
for a bride 
but not just any bride 
and he wouldn t be seduced
by fine eyes
or a flirtatious smile 
it s mr  malcolm 
twenty thousand a year 
he had no interest
in social climbers
or fortune hunters 
mr  malcolm was a kind man
who possessed an outward reserve
that concealed a warm heart 
a heart he was eager to bestow
upon the appropriate young lady 
in fact  he had set upon
a unique way
of pursuing true love
that was beginning to earn him
quite the reputation 
 orchestra playing
 largo al factotum  
 lucy 
it s julia thistlewaite 
  la la lalera  
julia thistlewaite
with mr  malcolm 
it would be the match
of the season 
hasn t she been out
in society for 
what  four seasons 
it may be time to think
about stepping aside
and allowing
the younger ladies
have their chance 
he gave up his seat
for me once 
i nearly swooned 
  la la la la la la
a te fortuna  a te fortuna  
i do wonder why they make
so many foreign operas 
we are in england 
after all 
do you not agree 
mr  malcolm 
are you not a fan
of rossini 
miss thistlewaite 
is he the short  stout man 
no  no 
he s the composer 
oh 
how silly of me 
you must think me
quite ignorant 
no  not at all 
perhaps you are
better informed
on other matters 
 chuckles 
tell me 
what opinion do you hold
on the corn laws 
 the corn laws 
 yes 
uh  let me think 
 chuckles 
 mouthing  the corn laws 
why  i am for them 
of course 
  malcolm  really 
 mmm 
and why is that 
if i may ask 
well  i  
i believe that  um   
restraint in one s diet
is bound to have
a healthful effect 
 singer 
  sono il factotum della citt√†  
 singing continues 
 chuckles 
it s a pity
you re not able to speak
on the parliamentary floor 
your    views
could change
the face of politics 
or its figure 
at any rate   chuckles 
 song ends 
  audience applauding 
 do you see he is yawning 
 lady margaret 
how embarrassing 
 mooing 
 quacking 
 children laughing 
slow down 
 child chattering  laughing 
 sighs 
you have a caller 
again 
but i am not
accepting callers 
well  i know that 
but try telling that to someone
who thinks he knows more
than the whole of england 
oh  mama 
hmm 
ah 
mr  woodbury 
 chuckles 
so kind of you to call 
and so frequently  too 
miss dalton 
my father is out visiting
the parish s sick 
as he does
every tuesday 
i do not believe
it would be improper
to dispense
with his chaperonage
this once  miss dalton 
i was emboldened
to approach you
knowing that with the recent
unfortunate demise
of your employer 
you have been cast
into this world
without fortune or prospects 
i realize that
i may be your senior
by  well  a few years 
but i have always felt
that a woman would benefit
from a more
mature companion 
one who can give her
guidance in life 
like a father 
you mean 
 chuckles 
you jest  miss dalton 
or  um    selina 
if i may be so bold 
you must know
how ardently i admire you
and how   
it is my fondest desire
to have you   as my wife 
i am greatly honored
by your offer 
but i cannot accept 
oh 
oh 
do not be so hasty 
miss dalton 
 tis common knowledge
your father is
of modest means 
and you are but one
of his many offspring 
i am prepared
to assist them
if you wed me 
but if you refuse 
well  your prospects
will be very grim  indeed 
hmm 
well  it is true
that my family situation
weighs heavily on me 
but i still must refuse
your kind offer 
i find such an attitude
incomprehensible 
i must warn you 
this offer will not
be extended a second time 
third actually 
i understand
and fully accept
the consequences
of my decision 
and now 
i must beg you
to please excuse me 
 stammers  i   
goodbye  mr  woodbury 
 sighs 
 honking 
out of my way 
idiot geese 
morning  john 
oh 
have you heard
lord christopher jones
has finally found
a suitable match 
do you not want to know
who he has chosen to marry 
i doubt i have any choice
in the matter 
a miss marjorie notcutt 
mmm  fascinating 
is that from selina 
my dear 
yes 
she writes so often
i can barely keep up 
oh  dear  mr  woodbury
has proposed again 
i have noticed mr  malcolm
doesn t appear to be calling 
i do have more than one
gentleman caller 
you must not feel too bad
you have failed
to capture his notice 
some say he will never
choose a wife 
i feel perfectly fine 
mmm 
there is something
from lady burke 
 laughs 
she s sent me one of those
wicked caricatures
that are all the rage 
it appears to be
of mr  malcolm 
and i am in it as well 
no 
it can t be 
 julia screams 
 snorting 
oh  julia 
  pedestrian 1 
did you hear about mr  malcolm 
  pedestrian 2  no 
 pedestrian 1 gasps

 pedestrian 4 
miss thistlewaite

 pedestrians laughing

 pedestrian 3 
how mortifying 
 grunts 
her reputation must be

cassie  please discover
what i did to incur
this humiliation 
take this to my cousin 
you will find him
at his club 
the lord of limbs 
 julia 
immediately 
 chattering 
i am ruined 
 pedestrian 3 
she ll never find a husband 
i think 
 chattering continues 
  coach driver  steady 
  horse neighs

refreshment  sir 
thank you 
good evening  sir 
 people chattering 
goodness 
i shall come here more often 
good evening

cheers 
ooh  that s strong 
 clears throat 
 john clears throat 
oh  god 
who else has seen this 
 cassidy  tell miss thistlewaite
i will handle the matter 
mr  malcolm 
excuse me 
my dance card at
the millers  ball next week
has a free space 
if you would be
so inclined 
you will have
to forgive me 
a riding ailment
does not permit me 
miss   
lady gwyneth amberton 
lady amberton 
daughter of earl
and countess amberton 
of course 
how strange 
i do wonder how
one encourages sentiment
without dancing 
malcolm 
lord cassidy 
lady amberton 
hello  how do you do 
how do you do 
now  excuse us 
uh  malcolm 
you are acquiring
quite the reputation 
is that so 
yes  indeed 
they are calling you
a trifler   
 laughs 
   a breaker of hearts 
a destroyer
of young ladies  dreams 
you re joking 
no 
what nonsense 
well  perhaps
the gossips are correct 
you paid
very particular attention
to my cousin julia
and now
have not been to call 
i escorted your cousin
to the opera once 
i did not pay her
 very particular
attentions  
what actually occurred
is besides the point 
it s what people say
that matters 
and everyone is saying
that there must be
something wrong with julia 
i m sorry that your cousin
has become the target
of gossips 
but i do not plan to marry
a woman merely because
i took her to the opera 
no  no one said
you had to 
that is what they want 
isn t it 
what are those dreams
i am accused of destroying 
dreams of marrying
the  catch of the season 
purely for my fortune 
i will not have it 
 croupier  place your bets 
do you want in 
no  no  i have spent
all my money 
 croupier 
oh  excellent 
why not just choose
some girl
and just make
an end of it 
you know 
propagation of the species
and all that 
why do you think
i am here tonight 
i am very anxious
to find a suitable bride 
then why not julia 
she s generally acknowledged
as a handsome woman 
here you go  sir 
thank you 
she s handsome enough 
but she s not the one for me 
no 
 croupier 
place your bets 
why not 
i don t know 
she  
she flutters her eyelashes
far too much 
malcolm 
that s blinking 
that  
that is your reason 
no  that s
a pretty paltry reason 
it was very distracting 
numerous times
throughout the evening 
i thought she was going
to fall asleep 
don t look at me
like that 
place your bets 
it was not the only thing
that turned me off
miss thistlewaite 
here 
item four 
 converses in
a sensible fashion  
my tailor s conversation
is far more scintillating
than your cousin s 
i tried to engage her
in a discussion
about the corn laws 
and she thought
it was a diet regimen 
it s your turn  sir 
what is this 
is this a list 
 croupier  place your bets 
yes  it is 
you have some sort of
list of qualifications
for a bride 
yes  i do  so 
 croupier  chance  sir 
you may roll again 
 scoffs 
that is
damned arrogant of you 
no wonder you cannot
settle upon anyone 
you want them to meet
some catalog of requirements 
like a   
very well done  sir 
   like a tandem horse
you re purchasing
for your curricle 
exactly 
exactly that 
i have specific requirements
when filling my stable 
why not even more
stringent requirements
when choosing a bride 
a companion
i will see morning   
shall we roll again  sir 
   noon and night 
next thing you know 
you ll be putting her
through her paces
or checking her teeth 
 disaster 
 i ll add that to the list 
 croupier 
bad luck  sir 
one more 
no  i m not drinking 
one more 
 chirping 
she does not bite 
you know   laughs 
 exclaims 
you have the manners
of a billingsgate fishwife 
i would not know 
as i do not keep
the low society
you do  cousin 
 sighs 
from my friend selina 
evidently  the news
has reached sussex 
tomorrow
the whole of england
will know 
did you   
speak to mr  malcolm 
i did 
what did he say about me 
well  he agreed
that you are
a handsome woman 
did he 
that is good news 
but he has this list 
you see  and  um   
well  unfortunately 
you did not meet
the fourth qualification 
i would have failed it myself
as i have no interest
in politics
and have always found
the corn laws
particularly confusing 
he has a list   
of requirements
for a bride 
yes 
and i must say that
i did not care for the idea
at first myself 
but then when
he explained it to me 
i could see his point 
what if the girl has
some odd kick in her gallop 
charming 
well  his brother 
the viscount 
was lured into a terrible match
and left miserable
as a consequence 
i don t believe it 
the arrogance 
i would like to see
what is on this list 
cassie 
did you see it 
no 
 yes 
  groans 
but it would do you no good 
no good at all 
no one can live up
to these expectations 
i mean  even if you d passed
the corn laws test 
your eyelashes 
they irritated him to no end 
my eyelashes 
is the man deranged 
no  of course not 
you just can t fool him
with those tricks you pull 
he despises
flirtatious games 
the unmitigated gall 
what conceit 
is it rather warm
in here 
somehow i will see to it
that the honorable mr  malcolm
receives exactly
what he deserves 
he won t get away with this 
right 
right 
well  i d best be off 
and you re
going to help me 
no 
julia  absolutely not 
julia  no 
julia 
what are you doing 
 sighs 
julia  stop 
my dearest selina   
 scoffs 
   thank you
for your kind correspondence
in regards to
that vile caricature 
i ve been thinking that it would
cheer me up no end
to see you after all this time 
will you come visit me in london
for what is left of the season 
i promise you will be
well entertained 
apparently 
she s from the country 
would you just be quiet
for once  john 
posture 
 clears throat 
 coach driver 
steady 
whoa 
well 
selina 
julia 
 laughing 
you made it 
i did 
how long has it been 
my dear 
how you ve blossomed 
you look well yourself 
i m so glad
you re here 
you must be parched 
come inside 
yes 
john  put selina s bags
in her room immediately 
my dear cousin 
lord cassidy 
is dying to meet you 
so  tell us more
about how you ve been
occupying your time
in the charming countryside 
it s such a different life
from here in town 
yes 
well  as i mentioned
in my letters 
i had been in bath
serving as a companion
to the elderly lady ossory
in her final years 
yes  lady ossory 
how dreary for you 
no  no  it was not
at all unpleasant 
though i did long
for some companions
my own age 
bath has become
quite the destination
for septuagenarians 
oh  my dear 
i understand completely 
i find foreigners
very tedious as well 
well  your letter came
in the nick of time
as i ve yet to find
another position 
my dear selina 
if it is a position
that you re looking for 
i may have
the very thing 
 giggles 
well   position 
may not be quite
the right word 
it s more of
a project  a lark 
you see 
there is a gentleman 
a mr  malcolm 
who is widely known
for his arrogance 
is he the one
in that awful caricature 
the very same 
 sighs 
as you may know 
he paid me very public 
very pointed attentions
and then humiliated me
by withdrawing his suit 
julia 
how dreadful for you 
mmm 
uh  i  
i am so sorry 
it was very unpleasant 
especially when
i found out
that he had
a list that
he judged me against
and found me wanting 
what sort of list 
it is a list
of the qualifications
he is looking for
in a bride 
but he believes himself
to be so superior
that his qualifications
are quite unreachable 
i would love
for mr  malcolm
to receive the comeuppance
he deserves 
but i need
your assistance 
my assistance 
hmm 
if we were
to present you
as the perfect woman
that he is looking for 
and then allow him
to discover that
you have a list 
and he does not meet
the requirements
on your list 
well  that would be
a perfect sort of
poetic justice 
i don t know  it s  
it sounds rather   
mm mmm 
   devious 
 scoffs  my dear selina 
do not be
such a namby pamby 
i will not allow that man
to ruin one more reputation 
but if he is as arrogant
and fastidious as you say 
then how am i
to attract his attention 
if mr  malcolm
was not captivated by you 
then surely he will not
even look in my direction 
oh  selina 
what an astute observation 
however 
even though your look
is not fashionable
in the classical sense 
you are more informed than i
or any other young lady
before you 
you know
about the list 
and with some tutelage
from my cousin and me   
mmm 
   you have a very good chance
of meeting the requirements 
 chews  grunts 
your   your cousin
is going to instruct me
on how to attract
a sophisticated gentleman
of particular tastes 
mmm 
 chews  gags 
apparen   apparently  yes 
i i i don t think i   
my dear selina 
i do hope you ll agree
to help me 
after all 
we ve always looked out
for each other  have we not 
plus  it could be
rather fun 
what is it exactly
that you want me to do 
oh 
thank you 
 clears throat 
item number one 
 handsome of countenance
and figure  
 humming 
oh 
that s lovely  molly 
lower across
the bodice 
julia 
 julia  number two 
 graceful and well mannered  
look at me 
back arched
just a little  selina 
we are having
the gown cut low 
we don t want him
to miss the effect 
julia 
that s outrageous 
and we are   
one  two  three 
one  two  three 
one  two  three 
one  two  three 
don t stop now 
you will trip cassie 
one  two  three 
one  two  three 
and fly like a bird 
spin out 
pirouette 
 julia  number three 
 educates herself
by extensive reading  
 sighs 
becoming a suitable bride
is quite burdensome 
i almost feel as if
i m being trained up
to become a wife 
i know 
god forbid someone decided
to enter a marriage
based on love 
what a wonderful thing to say 
you must exude
an elegance of mind 
a knowledge
of the world 
while still
retaining the na√Øvet√©
that men find so charming 
 do you know anything
about the corn laws 
 of course i do 
it s very important
that you do 
i ve brought you some tracts
on the subject 
do not waste too much time
on those tracts  selina 
a gentleman doesn t
like a lady to be more
intelligent than he is 
a wife with a mind 
god forbid 
and thinking too deeply
causes forehead furrows 
it might be a good idea
if you meditated
on the ocean 
i find when i think
of the sea   
i m less apt
to wrinkle my brow 
oh  i almost forgot 
no blinking 
i beg your pardon 
malcolm doesn t like
flirtatious tricks 
well  cassie 
if you were paying
the least bit of attention 
you would have realized
i already explained
to selina
that there should be
no artificiality
in her behavior
when she pretends
an attraction
to mr  malcolm 
that doesn t sound
anything at all
like what i said 
well  excuse me
for not using words
of fewer syllables 
oh 
well  if you re
so bloody smart 
miss hoity toity 
how come you couldn t pass
malcolm s little test 
what is this now 
your fourth season 
maybe if you d
warned me 
i didn t want anything
to do with this 
i don t want anything
to do with you 
that s not  
enough 
i believe i have an idea
of what mr  malcolm
is looking for 
now  what plan do you have
for us to meet 
 julia 
selina  you are blending in 
 guests chattering 
now you must hide 
a job masterfully done 
i d say 
julia 
i m a little nervous 
do not worry 
wait in here 
hmm 
i shall return 
 guests chattering 
 music playing 
i should have stayed
in sussex after all 
i beg your pardon 
uh  i m   i am sorry
to disturb you  sir 
i thought this room
to be unoccupied 
 tis no matter 
um  hiding from
the dancing 
uh  something like that 
i was  um   
reflecting on
the futility of a dream 
is any dream futile 
it gives us hope 
and hope is a good thing 
in your opinion 
others of us may believe 
as the poet said 
  tis hope is the most
hopeless thing of all  
what a sad conviction 
i prefer to believe 
as johnson did 
that hope is
a  chief happiness
which this world affords  
but  perhaps 
you hope for
something unworthy 
in which case
you deserve to hope
in vain 
confess  sir 
you were hoping to win
at the gaming tables
and have lost 
and are now indulging
in a fit of pique 
i would not confess
to such childish conduct 
though had i played 
i would have hoped to win 
so you contend you hope
for something worthy 
i do  indeed 
then it is my hope
that you obtain it 
i am honored 
perhaps i am mistaken
in thinking hope
a useless thing 
 chuckles 
i   i m   
excuse me 
i m sorry 
i disturbed you  i   
i should go 
no 
no  i should be
the one to leave 
i have spent enough time
in solitary reflection 
i would be honored 
once you return
to the ballroom 
to be properly introduced 
anyway 
as my mother always said 
i am a natural born dancer 
i really am 
i mean  dancing runs
in my fam  
cassidy 
excuse me 
where have you been 
i have a likely prospect
for you 
young filly 
deep chested  long legs 
i very much regret using
this horse analogy 
no  i think
you ll like this one 
she has quite
the air of mystery
about her 
that sounds alarming 
i tend to
keep my distance from
mysterious young ladies 
besides 
i think i just found
a likely prospect of my own 
i just wonder
how long she ll stay
in the orangery 
sorry 
sorry  what s that 
did you meet  
did you say you just
met someone in the orangery 
yes  though she s
probably married
or equally ineligible 
excuse me 
i ll be right back 
 guest  lord cassidy 
sorry 
oh 
where is he off to 
 cassidy  excuse me 
selina  did you  
did you just meet
a gentleman in here 
yes 
he was delightful 
excellent 
 guest laughs 
i do not see
what s excellent about it 
julia says
i m not to leave this room 
she says
she has to create an  
an  aura of mystery 
about me 
forget what julia told you 
we re returning
to the ballroom immediately 
why  do you know
the gentleman 
i rather think i do 
come on 
quickly 
quickly 
my dear girl 
where have you been 
i see your dance card
is empty 
do not be so judicious 
hmm 
do you want
a drink 
no 
julia 
what are you doing here 
the beau monde
is fascinated by
the mysterious incognita 
there has been
an interesting
development 
mr  malcolm 
there s someone
i want to
introduce you to 
m mr  malcolm 
that is correct 
 mrs  thistlewaite 
mr  malcolm 
how lovely to see you 
and how well you look 
mrs  thistlewaite 
miss thistlewaite 
mr  malcolm 
i  however  have yet
to learn your name 
mr  jeremy malcolm 
may i present
miss selina dalton 
miss dalton 
i am very pleased
to make your acquaintance 
properly 
  mrs  thistlewaite 
now  tell me  mr  malcolm 
 hmm 
will your delightful mother 
her ladyship 
be joining us this season 
 properly  
they stumbled upon
each other moments ago
in the orangery 
how unpredictable 
it s wonderful 
i was hoping  miss dalton 
perhaps you might join me
for a tour of
the dulwich picture gallery
tomorrow 
thank you 
that would be nice 
tomorrow  then 
lord cassidy 
y yes 
well done 
 gasps 
 chattering 
mr  malcolm courting
yet another one 
shh  i think
he might hear you 
well  you most certainly
have a reputation 
as 
a trifler 
well  yes 
breaker
of hearts 
i suppose
one could say that 
a destroyer
of young ladies  dreams 
that is
an absurd exaggeration 
but i have heard
rumors along those lines 
and you 
do you believe
this description of me 
i am not ready
to pass judgment 
well  i am glad
to hear you say that 
miss dalton 
for i do not believe
i deserve this reputation
i have acquired 
particularly in the case
of miss thistlewaite 
i find myself blameless 
she told me you paid her
very marked attentions 
i escorted her
to the opera once 
i see  was it
an amusing opera 
no 
no  it wasn t 
the soprano missed
most of her notes 
and miss thistlewaite
wore this feather which
brushed against my nose
so frequently
over the course
of the evening 
i found myself
wanting to sneeze 
well 
you and miss thistlewaite
are the victims
of a most egregious
set of circumstances 
feathers
and screeching sopranos
are not conducive
to romance 
so you acquit me
of trifling with
miss thistlewaite s affections 
i am   i am afraid
i cannot 
you were
too easily put off 
a sincere gentleman
would have tried
a second time
before casting a woman aside
in the public eye 
invited her to
a musical concert  perhaps 
but i knew
i was not interested
in miss thistlewaite
after the opera 
had i continued
to pursue her 
i would have deserved
the reputation
i have acquired 
so what would
you have me do
in such circumstances 
jeremy 
 laughs 
excuse me 
jeremy malcolm 
henry ossory 
as i live and breathe 
what are you doing here 
i thought you were
stationed with your regiment
in the north 
i m just in town
for the memorial
of lieutenant colonel donoghue 
but i am thinking
of selling out
and joining the ranks
of you idle gentlemen wastrels 
are you sure
you re up to it 
it can be
quite exhausting 
well   
excuse me  miss dalton 
may i present
captain henry ossory 
miss dalton 
captain ossory 
 laughs 
miss selina dalton 
yes 
i take it the two of you
are familiar
with each other 
yes  miss dalton was
an excellent friend
of my uncle s widow 
i wanted to thank you
for your kindness to my aunt 
i see 
but what
a fortunate coincidence
to come upon you
so unexpectedly 
how opportune 
i am very pleased
to meet you  captain 
i esteemed your aunt
very highly
and have long wished
to express my condolences 
why  thank you 
i served as a companion
to captain ossory s aunt
in bath
during her final years 
how very kind 
well  i should let you
resume your tour
with mr  malcolm 
but i would be pleased
to call on you 
if you would give me
your direction 
i am staying
at the thistlewaites 
in berkeley square 
well  mr  malcolm 
ossory 
miss dalton 
oh  uh  do make sure
you see the venus and adonis 
quite exquisite 
goodbye 
what a fortuitous meeting 
quite 
look at mr  malcolm 
doesn t look pleased 
does he 
 snores 
 humming 
 julia  good evening  molly 
do not mind us 
uh  excuse me  miss 
 julia  selina must be
absolutely famished 
good evening  molly 
 julia 
just a little something 
it s beautiful 
 humming 
so   
what did he say about me 
um  merely
that he escorted you
to the opera 
i must admit  julia 
that does not seem
such a heinous crime 
did he tell you
about my eyelashes 
your eyelashes 
 scoffs 
just wait until he starts
to weigh you up against
that list of his 
then you ll see
how unpleasant he can be 
oh  selina 
 sighs 
i need you to help me 
there s no way
i can touch him 
he holds all
of london society
in his palm 
but i m just not sure
he is the villain
you paint him to be 
i want him humiliated 
as i was 
more than anything  i  
i want my reputation restored 
and my  
my prospects are dwindling 
i truly understand 
but maybe   
i have known you
nearly all my life 
and you have known
malcolm for  what 
less than a day 
ugh  he has this effect
on all women 
it s like he exercises
some kind of power over them 
he did not exercise
any power over me 
are you sure 
you did not find something
mesmerizing about him 
i cannot deny that
i see a certain   
 clears throat 
attraction 
i knew it 
you re being blinded
by his intelligent conversation
and devastatingly handsome
good looks 
well  take it from me 
it leads to nowhere 
are you feeling well today 
julia 
yes  quite well 
 door opens 
captain ossory 
oh  i m not acquainted
with a captain ossory 
are you  julia 
captain ossory is
an acquaintance of mine 
oh  send him in at once 
may i present
captain ossory to you 
ma am 
captain ossory 
mrs  thistlewaite
and miss thistlewaite 
your servant  mrs  thistlewaite 
miss thistlewaite 
please be seated 
captain 
thank you  ma am 
but actually
i came to request
the pleasure of a promenade
with miss dalton 
another one 
that would be lovely 
please excuse me
while i collect my things 
 ossory  of course 
 sighs  chuckles 
 clears throat 
so  captain ossory 
yes 
i was not aware
that selina had
an acquaintance in town 
yes  miss dalton was
a dear friend of my aunt s 
it s very strange 
she s never mentioned you 
pity 
are you situated in town
or is this a flying visit 
newly situated  yes 
i hope you don t mind
the intrusion 
a friend of selina s
is surely a friend
of mine   ours 
thank you both 
how kind 
 shall we go 
 yes 
mrs  thistlewaite 
miss thistlewaite 
lovely to meet you both 
indeed 
 door closes 
what 
 children laughing 
 ossory  i m not sure
if you are aware  miss dalton 
but my aunt
mentioned you many times
in her correspondence with me 
your aunt spoke of you
quite often  as well 
i am very pleased
to have this opportunity
to make your acquaintance 
yes 
i feel likewise 
i must admit  however 
to yet another motive
for seeking you out 
i came to london
to meet you
because it s my belief
that my aunt desired us
to make a match 
 stammers  laughs 
what gave you
that impression 
 laughs 
well 
her letter to me
before her death 
in it she wrote 
 it is my desire that you
and miss dalton make a match  
i see  then it appears
you interpreted
her meaning correctly 
yes  yes 
her words were
rather plain 
unless  of course 
she could have been
speaking of cribbage 
she could have meant
we should engage
in a cribbage match 
or chess 
could she not have been
speaking of chess 
i am afraid not 
she knew me to be a very 
very poor chess player 
ah  um  good day  henry 
miss dalton 
jeremy 
good day  mr  malcolm 
it appears
i have interrupted
a humorous discussion 
well   
it was nothing
of consequence 
we were discussing a letter
captain ossory received
from his aunt 
lovely 
 chuckles 
good 
well  i wondered if
you were to attend
lady hartley s ball
week after next 
 i believe i am 
 excellent 
as it happens 
i too am to attend
lady hartley s ball 
perhaps i might be
favored with a dance 
certainly 
 chuckles 
excellent 
well  shall we 
mm hmm 
after you 
good day 
sir 
 gossiper 1 
i ve heard
she s from sussex 
i must say 
whatever is the matter 
dear selina 
 gossiper 2 
where is sussex 
i  um  
i received correspondence
from my mother 
she s asked me to call on
my cousin s widow 
mrs  covington 
while i m in town 
whatever is wrong
with her 
when i met her last 
she would not
accept me at my word
that i had no beau 
she quizzed me
on the subject
for 20 minutes
before offering
to find me a husband 
i hate to think
how she ll react
when she finds out
i m still unwed 
she was married 
widowed and married again
by our age 
how vulgar 
selina 
whatever you do 
do not mention
to mr  malcolm
that you have
such a vulgar cousin 
one of the requirements
on his list is 
 has genteel relations
from good society  
 selina 
i wouldn t call the daltons
 from good society  
but  selina 
you re the daughter
of a clergyman 
that s at least
fourth class society 
possibly even third 
at best 
oh  and while
we re speaking of it 
at the dinner party 
you will need to play
the pianoforte 
what 
musical talent
is another requirement
on malcolm s list 
malcolm 
he loves music 
but i don t play
the pianoforte 
i am surprised
mr  malcolm desires a wife
when he could
just as easily hire
a performing bear 
do not worry 
dear selina 
i have a plan 
 julia  mr  banbury 
how s your wife 
 julia 
so  tell me  captain ossory 
how are you finding
society life so far 
i seem to be
constantly thwarted
in my endeavors 
hmm  what endeavors
are those  may i ask 
the art of courtship 
 cassidy  well  ladies 
what do we think 
tolerable enough 
handsome enough to tempt 
 malcolm laughs 
i find courting
to be less an art
than an avocation 
 mrs  thistlewaite 
you served in
the peninsular 
did you not 
captain ossory 
yes  in the 18th regiment
of light dragoons 
did you see any action 
captain 
yes  at waterloo 
i saw more death
than a man should 
but a great victory all round 
how brave 
 chuckles 
swapping a battlefield
for a ballroom 
how ironic 
perhaps 
however 
i still find myself
surrounded by
a multitude of sweaty men
desperate for female company 
 all laugh 
miss dalton  tell me 
how do you know
miss thistlewaite 
 you met at school 
i believe 
 yes  we attended  
we  uh  both attended
mrs  finch s
ladies academy as girls 
i attended on the
kindness of a benefactor
of my father s 
i was bullied quite terribly 
but julia was kind to me 
mmm 
miss dalton 
i was curious 
what is your opinion
on the church building act 
 mrs  thistlewaite 
what a weighty question
to ask over soup 
i believe
it is in bad taste
to discuss politics
before the entr√©e is served 
perhaps you are correct 
however  i am interested
in miss dalton s opinion 
well 
as the daughter
of a clergyman 
it is obviously
important to me
that there are
houses of worship
available to all 
however 
i feel that
the million pounds set aside
for this purpose
is exorbitant 
i believe our government
intends by this measure
to suppress the radicals
and keep anarchy at bay 
when they could use
some of those funds
to better
the lot of the poor 
thereby accomplishing
the same purpose 
they could just
pay us better 
 cutlery clatters 
hear  hear 
 all laugh 
wonderful 
i apologize
for the lecture 
but you did ask me
for my opinion 
i am sure your father himself
could not preach
a more eloquent sermon 
 ossory clears throat 
and you  mr  malcolm 
what s your opinion
on the matter 
although i doubt
you will be able to express
your argument as well 
 chuckles 
it s very much the same 
actually 
 piano playing 
 cassidy humming 
 playing continues 
 ossory chuckles 
good shot 
miss thistlewaite 
 chuckles 
oh 
 laughs 
i must be nearsighted 
 cassidy  selina 
you re taking losing
mighty well 
how amiable
and even tempered of you 
take another shot 
my dear 
may i assist 
yes 
so  keep your shoulders
in line with the target 
ball between your feet 
a little more 
 malcolm  hands steady 
deep breath in 
 inhales 
 exclaims 
thank you 
brilliant 
all right 
captain ossory 
it s your shot
for the win 
it s an easterly wind 
so aim a little
to the right 
 clears throat 
well done 
 cassidy  marvelous 
 julia  it would have been
a shame to lose
on such an easy shot 
 cassidy 
can you pass me the shawl 
quite 
my legs are cold 
the wind was 
uh  westerly 
if i had listened to you 
i would have 
oh  captain 
i m pretty sure
it s to the east 
i m surprised you lasted
that long in the cavalry
with such a dreadful
sense of direction 
 laughs 
besides 
i never lose 
neither do i 
my lords and ladies 
may i have your attention 
please 
lot seven

irish draft mare

well schooled and hunted

 cassidy 
my mother used to always say 
 never  ever  ever
go near a horse   
enough about the horses 
tell us what malcolm
thinks of our girl 
no  please 
not this again 
he told me that he
was initially impressed
by her wit and humor 
um 
but was concerned
that she was not
serious enough 
but after the dinner party 
that fear was laid to rest 
 not serious enough  
he certainly makes
rash judgments 
it s as i ve told you 
selina 
there is
no pleasing the man 
no  no  look  i may have
quoted him incorrectly 
he was very 
very complimentary 
he said you ve nearly met
all of the qualifications
on his list 
which is a good thing 
oh  dear 
i know this is
hard to hear  selina 
but it shall be over soon 
 julia  that s not
what i m saying 
 selina   gasps 
selina dalton 
how rude 
as i live and breathe 
cousin gertie 
what a surprise 
may i introduce
my dear friend   
miss thistlewaite 
miss thistlewaite 
 laughs 
that s a mouthful 
miss thistlewaite 
 laughs 
say that one 20 times 
miss thistlewaite 
miss thistlewaite  miss  
 laughing 
say it  try  try 
miss thistlewaite 
miss   you can t do it 
what you need  my girl 
is a husband
so you can change
that ghastly tongue twister
of a name 
 laughing 
mrs  covington 
may i introduce you
to lord cassidy 
how do you do 
 mrs  covington 
oh  lord   chuckles 
hey  malcolm 
malcolm 
 mrs  covington  is that
the famous mr  malcolm 
do you know him 
i saw the most
hilarious caricature of him
a few weeks past 
 gasps 
i didn t know
you were here 
mr  malcolm 
captain ossory 
what a wonderful
surprise 
nice to see you again 
miss thistlewaite 
 clears throat 
mrs  covington 
may i present
the honorable mr  malcolm
and captain henry ossory 
i m delighted
to make your acquaintance 
mrs  covington 
mrs  covington 
no  sir  it is i
who am delighted 
 chuckles  stammers 
well  i have never been
in the same room with a captain 
a lord and an honorable 
although  i am not
quite exactly sure
what it means
to be an honorable 
it s the next best thing
to a lord  am i right 
he is the younger son
of an earl 
 mrs  covington 
oh  oh  oh 
now  that s a real pity 
because you ve got
the look of a lord 
much more than
this young gentleman
over here   laughs 
you know  mr  malcolm
has a more  um   
dignified look
about him 
 julia stammering 
cassie 
i think mrs  covington
would probably like
a drive home   
by a lord 
i m sure his lordship
has other plans
for the rest
of the afternoon 
no  no  he doesn t
have any plans 
julia  i do 
no  you don t 
i do  no  i  
no  i don t 
thank you 
i would be honored 
i am glad i dressed
so sensibly today 
is this hat
not ravishing on me 
quite 
quite 
shall we go then 
of course 
of course 
one thing i learned
in my two trips
to the altar
is that the gentlemen
don t like to be
kept waiting 
 cackling  oh  yes 
they re never waiting 
oh  yes 
selina 
julia thistlewaite  
i ll call sometime soon 
excuse me  sorry 
yes 
 muffled chuckle 
and how are you acquainted
with mrs  covington 
she   she is  
my cousin 
 your cousin 
 yes 
 right 
 seven times removed 
selina  my dear 
if we re not buying 
we d better be going 
well 
before you leave 
i was wondering if
miss dalton would join me
for a ride tomorrow 
um  i i  
she would be honored
to ride with you 
mr  malcolm 
now 
that s settled 
us ladies should
leave you gentlemen
to your stallions 
good afternoon 
 auctioneer calling 
ladies 
all done 
at 84  the seller in front 
at 84 guineas  last  sold 
my dear selina 
it is working 
and now thanks to me 
you will not fail item six 
i thought that must be
why you claimed her 
couldn t imagine
you felt a sudden desire
for her kinship 
ugh 
no 
just do not
reverse course on me 
i will not  julia 
i promise to be everything
he desires in a woman 
witty  humorous 
serious  genteel 
musical  fashionable 
only the best relations
and all at the same time 
excellent 
selina 
i thought you might
like to wear this 
oh  it is  
it is magnificent 
but i cannot 
nonsense 
 sighs  i must say 
it looks ravishing on you 
it is yours now 
thank you  julia 
it is nothing 
see you tonight 
see you tonight 
mmm 
 ducks quacking 
that is a very beautiful
bonnet on you 
you are very quiet
this afternoon 
please don t feel the need
to make conversation 
i much prefer silence
to those that rattle on
with nothing to say 
like that mrs  covington 
she s quite
the character  isn t she 
i must say  i m very glad
i m not courting
miss thistlewaite 
beg your pardon 
what do you mean 
well  i mean   
well  it s obvious 
isn t it 
that i would want
my future companion s relations
to have a modicum
of gentility 
and if they did not 
i m sorry
i introduced the subject 
 tis a moot point 
after all 
i m not courting
miss thistlewaite 
i m court  
well   
i think it s quite clear
who it is i m courting 
isn t it 
but if you were
still courting julia
and you had met mrs  covington 
would that affect
your opinion of julia 
well  it would have to 
wouldn t it 
there s a saying
where my family is from 
 speaking yoruba 
a man who marries a woman
marries all her relatives 
i m sorry  i   
i ve said too much 
i understand this is
quite overwhelming 
and what do you find
overwhelming  mr  malcolm 
the society balls 
gold rimmed tea cups 
the tying of silk cravats 
all of this is very easy 
you learn the rules 
you follow the rules 
if there is a moment
where there is no rule 
you make a rule 
you follow that 
i find everything else
overwhelming 
why did you come
to london  miss dalton 
because
i was lonely 
i was lonely  too 
before you came 
i    i am having
a house party
at my estate in kent 
and i would be pleased
if you would come
as my guest 
i am honored
by the invitation 
but i am a guest
of the thistlewaites 
i will invite them as well 
and cassie  of course 
i ll even invite ossory
if you d like 
my mother is coming
to act as hostess 
and i thought perhaps
your parents might like
to come as well 
thank you 
i shall write
and ask them 
i suppose we should
be heading back 
 rips 
 selina gasps 
miss dalton 
i am so sorry 
i seem to have
torn your dress 
 tis no matter 
mr  malcolm 
it can easily be repaired 
please  call me jeremy 
jeremy 
did mr  malcolm mention
if captain ossory
has been invited 
yes  he told me
he s on the guest list 
ugh  what a bother
that man has become 
 sighs  i shall have
to distract him  of course 
my dear  have you thought about
captain ossory for yourself 
mummy  no 
he s a perfectly
good match 
but far too low down
in comparison
to our own good standing 
mm hmm 
 gasps 
we re here 
well  that certainly
looks impressive 
a mrs  thistlewaite 
miss thistlewaite
and miss dalton  my lady 
my darling selina 
mama 
i missed you so much 
my little chickpea 
 mrs  dalton 
you look so well 
 malcolm 
welcome to hadley hall 
thank you 
it is beautiful 
a little smaller
in real life 
may i present my mother
elizabeth malcolm 
the countess of kilbourne 
lady kilbourne
will do just fine 
mrs  howard will
show you to your rooms 
i thought you might like
to refresh yourselves
before joining us for tea 
that would be lovely 
how s kitty 
 mr  dalton 
she was pining a little bit 
but she ll be fine 
miss dalton   
i am very happy
you re here 
i am very happy
to be here 
the stables
are in the east wing 
 grunts 
i could get used
to the country 
one day  i ll buy
a house just like this 
 laughs 
not on your salary 
 groaning 
my son tells me
you were raised in sussex 
miss dalton 
yes  my lady 
which part of sussex 
chailey 
and  mr  dalton 
i believe you still serve
as vicar there 
yes  my lady 
coming on nearly
20 years now 
and  mrs  dalton 
are your people
from sussex as well 
my family s name
is kingswater 
kingswater 
i m afraid i do not know
any kingswaters 
 mr  dalton clears throat 
 bell chimes 
mrs  thistlewaite 
we cannot thank you enough
for taking care
of our selina 
it s been no problem
at all 
selina  i forgot to ask you
how mrs  covington is 
did you call on her
as i asked 
mrs  covington
is the widow of my cousin 
she lives in town 
 coughing 
i did run into
mrs  covington 
 mrs  dalton  good 
i m glad to hear it 
her husband
was my second cousin only 
but she is a widow 
mrs  dalton and myself
have always taught selina
to show compassion
to those in less fortunate
circumstances 
pray  excuse me
as i take a turn about the room 
he fell at waterloo 
he died a hero s death
by all accounts 
cut down by cannon
while defending
wellington s flank 
there was nothing left
of him to bury 
so we were forced
to conduct his funeral
in absentia 
 lady kilbourne 
terribly sad 
miss dalton 
i do not care
that mrs  covington
is your cousin
and i am sorry
i gave that impression 
it is i
who must apologize 
i think you were concerned
for my good opinion
and thought
if you told the truth 
you d lose it 
it is my fault 
i sounded dreadfully arrogant
and i have regretted it
many times since 
i ve been wanting
to tell you the truth 
but i  
i believe you 
then let s forget all about
this foolish incident 
it does neither of us
any good to harp on it 
uh  mr  and mrs  dalton 
perhaps you could write
to your cousin
and invite her
to join us
at next week s ball 
that sounds like
such a fun idea 
don t you agree 
mr  dalton 
yes 
well  i am confident
that the behavior
that prevails
at these occasions in town
will not permit here 
mr  malcolm seems
a very trustworthy gentleman 
 knocking 
 julia  selina 
may i come in 
 sighs 
selina  i   
i think it is time 
if you think
it is time for bed 
i can only agree 
 chuckles 
no 
i think it is time
to show mr  malcolm
your list 
julia   
i know mr  malcolm
hurt your feelings
and i am so sorry 
what are you saying 
i am saying
that i do not think
mr  malcolm is
the man you think he is 
i see 
now that you have seen
hadley hall
and seen how rich he is 
you think you can get him
to marry you  is that it 
i wonder if you would
like him as much
if he was
a poverty stricken curate
from yorkshire 
no  that is not it 
i am not interested
in mr  malcolm
because of his possessions 
 scoffs 
he has been kind to me 
you agreed to help me 
we were in this together 
i don t feel mr  malcolm
deserves such treatment 
and i 
you think i deserve
such treatment 
i was humiliated
in front of the whole
of good society 
have you never
offended anyone 
it happens 
frequently 
no one wants a person
incapable of forgiveness
for a friend 
and i don t want
a prosy preacher s daughter
for a friend 
 exclaims 
this is mine 
 door slams 
 malcolm  what was that 
 lady kilbourne 
probably that miss thistlewaite 
she looks the
door slamming type
to me 
thank you  reeves 
what surprises me
is that she did not
set her cap for you 
she did  at first 
it was short lived 
what happened 
well  i took her
to the opera once and   
did not call again 
it died a natural death 
hmm 
so you think 
i doubt she d forget
that kind of rejection
very quickly 
she s not enjoying
taking second place
to your miss dalton 
she s not my miss dalton 
not yet 
yes  i know 
i do wish you would hurry
the business 
you know how much
i detest entertaining 
so  you approve 
if i had
my wits about me 
i d persuade you
to marry some silly 
ignorant girl
against whom
i would not suffer
in comparison 
someone like
your brother s wife 
mother  you would suffer
no matter whom i married 
and surely
you must know by now 
relations by marriage
were designed to aid us
in developing our character 
selina   
selina is a gift from god
in that regard 
and far be it for me
to question the almighty 
mr  dalton would not approve 
checkmate 
yes  mother  i know 
 chuckles 
 bird squawks 
 gun fires 
 dog barks 
 selina  well done 
thank you  sir 
selina 
captain ossory 
 julia  i think it should be
a masquerade 
they re all the rage 
 cassidy 
yeah  but i have to wear
a mask though 
 julia  it s not up to you 
it s mr  malcolm s home 
 cassidy 
of course it is  but   
 sighs 
we were just discussing
next week s ball 
right 
julia wants it to be
a masquerade 
what is your opinion 
well  i ve never been
to a masquerade before 
see  mr  malcolm 
it must be a masquerade 
selina has never been to one 
then it s decided 
a masquerade it is 
i do believe we have
some costumes
in the attic  sir 
excellent 
thank you  reeves 
everyone feel free
to help yourselves 
thank you 
i should be able to find
what i need at the dressmakers 
do you plan on
going as a lady 
of course not  a greek 
any particular greek 
 cassidy 
any greek will do 
 julius caesar 
  laughs 
julius caesar
was roman 
greek  roman 
it scarcely matters 
i plan to wear
a white robe
and some leaves
over my ears 
i went to one
of these blasted things
as henry viii once 
i almost suffocated 
i remember 
what are you wearing 
selina 
um   
i have no idea 
i was hoping
to get some inspiration
once i visited the attic 
why not go
as your namesake 
who do you mean 
selene  goddess of the moon 
cassie has already taken
my costume 
i told you 
i m not going as a woman 
i ll be one
of those  um   
 stammers 
philosophical fellows 
like plato or socrates 
my cousin going as
one of the deepest thinkers
in history 
that does quite
boggle the mind 
 all laugh 
so will you go
as selene 
i have no objection
masquerading as a goddess 
who is this selene 
selene was
the goddess of the moon 
which she drove across
the sky every night 
the story goes that
she fell in love
with a mere mortal
who was far beneath her 
both literally
and metaphorically 
 hmm 
 hmm 
i had no idea
military men had such
an intimate understanding
of mythology 
oh  i think there s
quite a lot you don t know
about military men 
selina  i would be happy
to assist you
with your costume 
i could take some designs
to my dressmaker
when i head into town 
why  thank you  julia 
mmm 
right 
miss thistlewaite 
let s shoot something 
 sighs  if we must 
gentlemen 
now  the trick is
keep the stock tight
to your chest
and shoot where the bird
will be rather than
where it is  all right 
 clears throat 
 ossory  thank you  sir 
 birds squawking 
 gun cocks 
 grunts 
 bird squawks 
 wings flapping 
  ossory laughs 
  dog barks 
hmm  i think i ve got it 
i ve never seen
a woman do that before 
i suppose
that s a compliment 
it most certainly is 
yes 
 bird squawks 
 dog barks 
 ossory laughs 
 chattering  laughing 
mr  dalton 
is that really the best
you could have done 
oh  mr  malcolm 
what a pleasure
to be invited to
your very impressive home 
you must be very thirsty 
mrs  covington  allow me
to escort you to get some punch 
how gracious  mr  malcolm 
you  the host 
i knew what they said
about him couldn t be true 
shall we 
oh  yes 
mother 
 mrs  covington laughs 
oh 
cassie 
yes 
i must speak with you 
you know  julia 
i must say 
i don t know why
ladies complain about having
to wear feminine attire 
this is quite
a bit more comfortable
than knee breeches 
i can tell you 
when i walk 
there s the most
refreshing breeze 
cousin  i did not come here
to discuss the benefits
of wearing a dress 
it s not a dress 
i need to talk to you
about selina and malcolm 
ah  i see 
you ve finally caught on
to the fact
that all your scheming
was for nothing 
well  i knew that
all along 
i knew they were
perfectly suited
to each other 
i imagine that must sting
just a little bit 
you thought
to humiliate malcolm 
and you end up presenting him
with the perfect wife
on a silver platter 
a pirate 
you know  julia 
you and malcolm   
you re much more alike
than you ve considered 
you really shouldn t be
so damned picky 
or you might
miss your chance 
boop 
i m going to go 
well  i almost didn t
recognize you there 
miss thistlewaite 
captain ossory 
is that you 
your costume is
very out of character 
i m not sure
how to take that remark 
do you find me
dull and spiritless 
not manly enough
for swashbuckling adventure 
 scoffs  no 
no 
i find you quite manly 
i m not entirely sure
how we strayed onto
that topic 
 laughs 
the fault
is entirely mine 
though i cannot regret
the unintentional compliment
you gave me 
 announcer 
ladies and gentlemen 
prepare your wigs
and hoist your dresses   
shall we 
   for the quadrille 
 guests applauding 
which is quite nice 
it s just a bit
of fabric really

julia

miss dalton 
miss thistlewaite

 door closes 
molly 
molly 
for mr  malcolm 
 ossory 
she s too good for you 
you know 
 malcolm 
that i believe wholeheartedly 
thank you  reeves 
i have an appointment
in my study
with a certain lady 
wish me luck  old boy 
next time you see me 
hopefully i ll be betrothed 
i would wish you luck 
but i don t think
you ll need it 
well  you cast your eye 
the night is young 
julia 
 door closes 
this reminds me
of our first meeting 
do you remember
what you said to me 
i said i thought
hope a futile thing 
and you disagreed with me 
yet you said you hoped
i obtained what
i was looking for 
you had little idea
the thing i was looking for
was you 
i wanted to wait 
at least until the end
of the house party 
but i do not think i could be
any more convinced
than i am right now 
selina   
would you do me the great honor
of becoming my wife 
what s this 
 qualifications for a husband 
does not make others feel
as if they cannot live up
to an impossible standard  
no  selina 
selina  wait 
selina 
 door rattles  opens 
julia 
 chattering  laughing 
selina  aren t you
supposed to be
in the study 
what 
with malcolm 
he said he was
meeting you there 
i made no appointment
with mr  malcolm 
please excuse me 
uh   
is everything all right 
i don t know 
julia 
what   what is
the meaning of this 
 malcolm  selina  wait 
wh what s this 
i think you d
best explain yourself  julia 
miss thistlewaite 
so it was you who refused
my offer just now 
offer 
well 
it s his own fault 
you spurned me publicly 
all because i didn t meet
a qualification
on that cruel list of yours 
so yes 
i decided to show you
what it feels like
to be judged
and found wanting 
can you blame me
for enlisting selina
in the  
selina 
 laughs 
don t tell me you had
a part to play in this 
julia mentioned it
to me 
but you cannot think i  
please 
the time for pretense
is over 
i never engaged
in any pretense 
so you did not lie to me
and tell me mrs  covington
was not your cousin 
 announcer 
ladies and gentlemen 
the cotillion 
good god 
what a fool i have been 
 orchestra playing cotillion 
i should have known
from then 
j jeremy 
you will call me
mr  malcolm 
m mr  malcolm 
please hear me out
before you condemn me 
and how can i believe
a word you say 
it seems you have been
deceiving me
from the beginning 
malcolm  perhaps you should
listen to what
she has to say 
i hardly think you re
the appropriate person
to counsel me 
it s obvious they ve
beguiled you as well 
 guests exclaiming 
 music continues playing 
if you will excuse me 
i am in the middle
of hosting a ball 
a masquerade 
ironically 
do you see 
do you see now
how arrogant he is 
how could you stand there
and say nothing 
well  if you re wondering
whether to lock me in my room 
i can assure you 
i do not intend
on coming down again tonight 
selina  
don t bother 
are you satisfied
with your behavior  julia 
course not 
oh  i feel like
i m going to be sick 
i think it s best
i return to the ballroom 
 sighs  sniffs 
 music stops 
 guests applauding 
 crying 
 molly 
your shoulders down 
 molly chuckles 
stop standing on my feet 
 quacking 
 mr  dalton  you disappeared
early last night 
 selina  did i 
you know  selina 
though mr  malcolm 
from what acquaintance
i have made of him 
appears true of heart 
he is nevertheless
from an altogether
different sphere 
this decision
i have come to believe
you are making 
we want you to know
that it s yours and yours alone 
and even if you and mr  malcolm
should decide not to make
a match of it 
well  it s been nice
to have had a little holiday 
papa 
 sighs 
i ll leave you
to your thoughts 
though it pains me
to admit it 
i have to concede
that you were right 
and i was   
not entirely right 
 reeves  that should
do the trick  sir 
thank you 
oh  we must do something 
 groans 
i think that s how
this whole debacle began 
captain ossory 
what if you were to pretend
to woo selina 
i think malcolm
was jealous of you before 
it might work again 
i don t think so 
i prefer to let them
work out matters for themselves 
well  they don t appear to be
doing a very good job of it 
malcolm has all but disappeared
since last night 
cassie 
hmm 
would you give us
a moment  please 
yes  of course 
i really should check
where malcolm is anyway 
 groans 
captain ossory 
it s all perfectly harmless 
i just want to ensure
that malcolm values selina
as he should 
hmm 
i think there have been
enough silly schemes 
don t you think 
miss thistlewaite 
but you wouldn t even
have to do anything 
although it might be a good idea
if you did pay selina
a little extra attention 
i refuse to pretend
an attraction i do not feel
and stand by
and let you ignore
the one that i do feel 
but you came to london
to make a match with selina 
so now i m not
even allowed to decide
to whom i m attracted 
does this feel as though
i m attracted to miss dalton 
well 
i may not be a lord
or an honorable 
but i m falling in love
with you  julia 
and i plan on devoting
the rest of my life
to keeping those
nasty habits of yours
in check 
 both laugh 
in fact  i positively
look forward to it 
oh  henry 
 neighs 
shh 
jeremy 
could we speak outside 
you know
i don t like horses 
you have some nerve 
after the trick
you all played on me 
i was helping you 
if only you had
the wit to see it 
 tis true that julia wanted
to humiliate you 
i  on the other hand 
i knew miss dalton
was perfect for you
from the very beginning 
whether you thought
you were helping me or not 
miss dalton used information
she obtained from you
about what i was looking for
in a wife to become that woman 
i have absolutely no idea
who she actually is 
that is simply not true 
she barely paid any attention
to anything that we said 
 stammers  well  except the  
the musical talent part 
that she had to fake 
my point is 
if she had listened to us 
she probably wouldn t have
attracted your notice at all 
so what you re saying is
she s smarter than you
and julia 
no  no  that s not
what i m saying 
she is most likely smarter
than julia or i  
for christ s sake 
cassie 
dash it 
you re twisting my words 
what i m trying to say 
jeremy  is that if  
selina dalton
is the right woman for you 
and if you ruin this 
you ll regret it
for the rest of your life 
if i ruin this 
well  lord cassidy 
i appreciate your concern 
however  nowhere on
my now infamous list
does it specify deception 
lying or scheming 
i am no longer interested
in miss dalton
and can only regret
that i fell foul
of her little game 
now 
if you will excuse me 
 exhales 
 knocking 
i suppose i have you
to thank for this 
i beg your pardon 
if you had thought
to orchestrate
a compromising situation 
i must admit  i had
thought you a great deal
cleverer than this 
i received an invitation
to tour the gardens 
i assumed it to be
a group tour 
i certainly did not plan
on meeting you here alone 
i suppose it s coincidence
then that i too
received a note 
though mine spouted
some nonsense about
 a discussion that promises
great future benefit  
it s all very melodramatic 
now i think on it 
you are to be commended 
miss dalton 
i have avoided
a great number of attempts
to entrap me in matrimony 
but never have
i met someone whose methods
are so obviously
contrived as you 
you insufferable 
arrogant 
conceited coxcomb 
i would never be content
to marry a man who holds
such a low opinion of me 
well  this is a good thing
there has been
no such engagement 
i now wish i had taken
a more enthusiastic part
in julia s despicable scheme
to humble you 
although i realize now
it would have never worked 
she expected you
to fall in love with me 
i have since learned
that you  
that you are
incapable of love  sir 
though perhaps
we re all better for it
because you re not
worthy of it  either 
goodbye  mr  malcolm 
i wish you and your list
all the happiness in the world 
miss dalton 
 knocking 
selina 
go away 
you have every right
to despise me 
i despise myself 
 good 
 i deserve that 
selina  i don t know why
i went through with it 
initially 
i wanted revenge
on mr  malcolm 
i was so angry that one man
could turn my entire life
into a farce 
but then i did want
to ruin your chances
with him as well 
selina 
we both had the dream
of marrying for love 
and after all
of my failed seasons 
i   
i gave up hope 
you captured malcolm s heart
without even trying 
and i was
so jealous of you 
i couldn t bear
to see you succeeding
where i had failed 
it all seems
so silly now 
if i had just stopped 
i would have seen
that the only person
i was failing is you 
selina  do you think
that you can forgive me 
 sighs 
please 
please don t go 
we must reconcile you
with malcolm 
i think you might have been
more correct in your reading
of mr  malcolm than i was 
that is very noble
of you  selina 
but is this
what you really want 
i will have john
prepare my carriage for you 
thank you 
julia 
yes 
i do want to thank you
before i leave 
had it not been for your  
for your scheme 
i would have never experienced
what it feels like
to fall in love   
and that alone
makes me very content 
i m happy for you 
what do you mean 
henry 
he s a good man 
how did you know 
cassie  of course 
i would have never expected
to fall in love
with someone like henry 
he s just so   
nice 
now  julia 
do not be
such a namby pamby 
 john  move on 
 carriage departing 
you do not look like
a man who has just
become happily engaged 
that s because
i m not happily engaged 
miss dalton has left 
you have ruined things 
haven t you 
and after all my efforts 
what  
what did you just say 
i am saying that i arranged
for a tour of the rose garden
at three o clock 
i assumed it would give
the two of you
enough time alone together
to come to some sort
of betrothal 
why did you  
why did you not tell me
this earlier 
if i had known you were
in such a great hurry
to bungle things 
you can be assured
i would not have exercised
such forbearance 
what did you do
to upset miss dalton so 
nothing so serious  i merely
accused her of attempting
to entrap me in marriage 
i must say 
jeremiah 
i am quite
disappointed in you 
mother  
i am well aware
that you have a list 
when i first learned of it 
i was concerned
that you had become
arrogant and judgmental 
but then i came to realize
your list is in the nature
of a shield 
so many women
have pursued you
for your fortune
that you did not want to
give your heart to a woman
that might prove unworthy 
but i have never met
so sincere a lady
as miss selina dalton 
it is difficult
for you to let someone
past that guard
that you ve placed around
your heart 
but unless you do 
you re in danger of losing
miss dalton s altogether 
love cannot be planned
so carefully  my dear 
it will stir things up
a bit 
that is part of its charm 
i have to go after her 
there s no need
to look so apprehensive 
she will not eat you 
you ve not seen her
in a temper 
she is a fearsome sight 
and more beautiful than ever 
 cassidy  it s the way
that they look at me 
this one reminds me
of great uncle vivian 
yeah  julia 
he was killed by a horse 
do you know
where she s going 
she s gone back to sussex 
her parents follow tomorrow 
thank you 
and thank you  cassie 
you were right 
i was  
i was right 
of course
i was right 
miss thistlewaite 
i am sorry 
i m sorry too 
 let s go 
 go  malcolm  go 
go 
go  malcolm 
 laughs 
hyah 
what on earth
do you think you re doing 
 exclaims 
 whinnies 
 panting  are you trying
to get us both killed 
i realized i forgot
to give you something
before you left 
what is it 
 selina scoffs 
do not tell me that is
your infamous list 
no 
it s a new list
that i just composed 
please 
i would like to offer
an explanation for the
deplorable way i ve treated you
since i found out
miss thistlewaite s plot
and then again
this afternoon
in the rose garden 
though it pains me
to admit 
i was relieved
to find an excuse
to discredit you 
there is
a certain feeling of   
insecurity
when you find yourself
falling in love with someone 
and i can only hope
that you will forgive me
for being a misguided fool 
miss selina dalton 
i have loved you deeply
from the moment
i saw you in the moonlight
of that orangery 
you are everything   
everything i could have
ever hoped for 
you are
the  chief happiness
this world affords  
to misquote johnson 
and i would count myself
the most fortunate
and humble of men
if you would
be my wife 
you have yet
to give me an answer 
tell me  though   
what opinion do you hold
on the corn laws 
 laughs 
has every stupid thing
