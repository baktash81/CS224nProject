of the public thinking   
that they have a right to invade
a person s private life 
come on  you had sex with a senator
in the parking lot of sea world 
you re telling me you re
a private kind of person  no 
  you re our  
  spotlight celebrity 
we want to hear about
the backrests of limos 
about the ruined lives of people
we want to be

edwin   come on  now 
i told you about these people 
they only mate with their own kind 
it s called yuppie inbreeding 
that s why so many are retarded and wear
the same clothes  they re not human 
they don t feel love 
they only negotiate love moments 
they re evil 
they re repulsed by imperfection 
horrified by the banal 
everything that america stands for 
everything that you and i tight for 
they must be stopped
before it s too late 
it s us or them

imperfection  horrified by the banal 
everything that america stands for 
everything that you and i fight for 
they must be stopped before

it was mr  lucas s offhand remark
that had fatal impact on mr  malnick 
marc saffron is on the scene 
an after work hot spot   
babbitt s is popular
with single  young professionals 
edwin malnick arrived
at the peak hour of 7 15   
took one long look at the collection
of the city s best and brightest   
then removed a shotgun
from his overcoat and opened fire 
seven people were killed before
mr  malnick turned the gun on himself   
and shot a hole through his head 
representatives of radio personality
jack lucas expressed regret   
however no formal comment
has been made 
neighbors of malnick said he was
a quiet man who lived alone 
 you scarcely knew he was there   said
a woman who lived near malnick 11 years 
but today  few will soon forget
this lonely man   
who reached out to a world
he knew only through the radio   
looking for friendship 
and finding only pain and tragedy 
marc saffron  channel seven news 
fuck 
garbage  people are garbage 
pigs 
go ahead and panic 
mr  happiness 
you gonna do a little work today
or what 
what  out there 
they re not terrorists 
they re just ordinary people
like you and me 
breakfast of champions  right 
that one 
that will be for me 
and then this scary one 
yes  a scary one and a funny one 
can you help me 
i ve been looking over an hour 
and i m losing my mind 
what i m in the mood for is
a katherine hepburny  cary granty thing 
nothing heavy  i couldn t take heavy 
i m looking for something zany 
or something modern would be fine 
like a goldie hawny  chevy chasey thing 
you know  funny 
i have to laugh tonight 
do you have anything with
that comedian  he s on that show 
it s  on the radio   you know 
the guy who says   hey  forgive me  
i get such a kick out of the way
he says that 
he s so adorable 
that would be perfect 
didn t he make a movie 
 ordinary peepholes

spread cheeky kind of thing 
excuse me  i just want
to borrow him for a minute 
you re gonna love that 
  that was a frightening woman 
  are you in one of your moods today 
if she didn t get something zany quick 
she was going to pull the pin 
is this one of the days
when you re in your emotional abyss 
i don t understand these moods
that you get into 
they re my moods 
you want to understand moods  have one

 why do we watch it all the time 
 i feel good to see how not funny it is 
how america doesn t know funny  which
makes it easier not being famous   
because that would mean
i m not really talented 
you are a sick fuck 
you know that 
i don t know why you torture yourself 
  don t do that  i don t like that 
  i m trying to watch 
you have too many thoughts
roaming around 
you re very self absorbed 
divert yourself 
read a book 
it s important to think  anne 
it s what separates us from lentils   
and people that read books
like  love song  
great book  dumb title 
you know  you used to say
you liked that about me 
you used to say you liked that we
didn t have to think all the time   
that we could just be together
and not think 
well   
suicidal paranoiacs
will say anything to get laid 
have another drink  jack 
it s on the house  like everything else 
i hope when you re my age  your children
treat you with the same disrespect 
i ve got a fever  i m dying

nietzsche says there are
two kinds of people in the world 
people who are destined
for greatness   
like walt disney and hitler   
and then there s the rest of us 
he called us   
 the bungled and the botched  
we get teased 
we sometimes get close to greatness   
but we never get there 
we re the expendable masses 
we get pushed in front of trains 
take poison aspirin   
get gunned down in dairy queens

some billionaire has the holy grail
in his library on fifth avenue 
who d think you d find anything divine
on the upper east side 
i don t mean to be flippant
or enrage you   
but you re a psychotic man 
a very nice psychotic man 
i appreciate what you did 
i think it was a brave and noble thing 
you re embarrassing me 
i m sure i ll see of lot of you
on talk shows when you get the grail 
please  don t go 
i can t 
i can t get it   
 cause he s out there 
he s always out there 
that s why you can get it

take care of yourself  jack 
give my love to the wife 
i m not married 
really  you look married 
don t be a stranger 
see ya 
hey  where you coming from 
the basement  i think 
i tell him no visitors 
hold it 
you a friend of parry s 
i don t allow no entertaining 
i let him stay here out of the goodness
of my heart because of the tragedy   
but i m not running a hotel 
and nobody s taking advantage of me 
tragedy 
he and his wife were in some bar   
and some nut comes in with a shotgun
and blew the place apart 
splattered her brains
all over the walls 
she was a beautiful girl 
never knew what hit her 
you heard about that 
that nut who listened to the radio 
you could ve been attacked 
raped  god knows what 
i was up all night  jack 
sorry 
  a guy wants to check out pornos 
  so send him back 
  what the hell happened 
  i was attacked 
what 
oh  baby 
two kids tried to set me on tire 
what did they do to you 
you almost done  are you looking
for a story  what 
  i ve seen most of them 
   creamer versus creamer   won an award
go 
did you call the police 
do you want me to call the doctor 
no  i m fine 
are you sure 
so where did you sleep last night 
i stayed at a friend s  anne 
okay  jack  i want you
to be up front with me 
it you re seeing somebody else 
just tell me 
you don t have to pour gasoline
on yourself and light a match   
just to break up with me 
just tell me the truth 
i was not seeing anyone else 
i really was attacked 
  i ve got a cut here 
  okay  i see it now  i m sorry 
i love you 
what are you gonna do 
you don t have to say it back   
although it wouldn t break your jaw
to try 
  you know what the holy grail is 
  holy grail 
yeah  i know that one 
that was like jesus  juice glass 
yeah  i used to be such a catholic 
  you still believe in god 
  you gotta believe in god 
but i don t believe god made men
in his image   
 cause most of the shit that happens
is  cause of men 
no  i think man was made
in the devil s image   
and women were created out of god   
 cause after all  women can have babies 
which is kind of like creating 
and which also accounts for the tact
that women are attracted to men 
 cause let s face it  the devil
is a hell of a lot more interesting 
i ve slept with some saints in my day 
and i know what i m talking about 
boring 
so the whole point of life   
i think 
is for men and women   
to get married so that
god and the devil can get together   
and work it out 
not that we have to get married
or anything 
god forbid 
you have a little thing right here 
a pimple 
this stuff is supposed to blend with
my skin  like it really works 
i don t think i m up for it tonight 
honey 
i just had
a very traumatic experience 
i know 
i m getting sick 
careful  careful

in a boiler room 
i m tired  i m upset 
i m not in the mood  okay

a guy goes to work every day

he starts questioning
the very fabric of his existence 
then one day about quittin  time   
the boss calls him into the office
and says   
 bob  come on in here and kiss my ass
for me  will you  
he says   hell with it 
i don t care what happens 
i just want to see his expression   
as i jam these scissors
into his arm  
then he thinks of me 
he says   wait a minute 
i got both my arms  both my legs

we could be killed
by a variety of people 
that s stupid  jack 
this park is mine
as much as it is theirs 
do you think it s fair they keep us out
because we might get killed 
  yes  i think it s very fair 
  i don t 
  what are you doing 
  i m cloud busting 
have you ever done it 
you lie on your back   
concentrate on the clouds and
break them apart with your mind 
it s wild  but you have to be nude 
you can t diffuse the psychic energy 
this is new york  no one s allowed
to be naked in a field in new york 
it s too midwestern 
it s wild  it s really treeing 
the air on your body  the nipples are
hard  little guy dangling in the wind 
come on  you re pissing me off 
we re bare assed naked
in the middle of it 
i m not doing this  this is nuts

  come on  jack  get back to your roots 
the man talks to invisible people

of central park 
i m not surprised  i m out of
my tucking mind to even be here 
who are you talking to 
  i m talking to the little people 
  are they here 
they re saying   jack  go to
the nearest liquor store   
findeth the jack of daniels   
that ye may be shit taced  
  they said that 
  you are out of your tucking mind 
bingo 
come on   free up the little guy 
let him flap in the breeze 
oh  jack 
nothing s happening 
concentrate 
what it some homophobic jogger
kills us   
to get back at his father 
 jack lucas found dead
next to a dead naked man 
the two were dead 
his companion was naked  
i hate it when they use the word
 companion   it s so insinuating 
probably boosts the sales
of my biography 
the public is fascinated with celebrity
murders that involve nakedness 
bastards 
i may be going out on a limb  but you
don t seem like a happy camper 
did you ever hear the story
of the fisher king 
it begins with the king as a boy having
to spend the night alone in a forest   
to prove his courage
so he can become king 
while he s spending the night alone   
he s visited by a sacred vision 
out of the fire appears
the holy grail   
the symbol of god s divine grace 
and a voice said to the boy 
 you shall be keeper of the grail
so that it may heal the hearts of men  
but the boy was blinded
by greater visions of a life   
filled with power
and glory and beauty 
in this state
of radical amazement   
he felt for a brief moment
not like a boy   
but invincible   
like god 
so he reached in the fire
to take the grail   
and the grail vanished   
leaving him with his hand in the tire
to be terribly wounded 
now  as this boy grew older   
his wound grew deeper   
until one day   
life for him lost its reason 
he had no faith in any man 
not even himself 
he couldn t love or feel loved 
he was sick with experience 
he began to die 
one day  a fool wandered
into the castle   
and found the king alone 
being a tool  he was simpleminded 
he didn t see a king 
he only saw a man alone
and in pain 
he asked the king 
 what ails you  friend  
the king replied   
 i m thirsty  i need some water
to cool my throat  
so the fool took a cup from beside
his bed  tilled it with water   
and handed it to the king 
as the king began to drink   
he realized his wound was healed 
he looked in his hands 
and there was the holy grail   
that which he sought
all of his life 
he turned to the tool
and said with amazement   
 how could you find that which
my brightest and bravest could not  
the tool replied   i don t know 
i only knew
that you were thirsty  
it s beautiful  isn t it 
i think i heard that
at a lecture once  i don t know 
it was a professor   
at hunter 
how come you never asked
that girl for a date 
i can t ask her 
i have to earn her 
this is the 20th century 
you don t have to earn a woman 
maybe after we get the grail 
she could help you get the grail 
women are great 
they make homes
and they kill the livestock   
so the knights can go out there
and get grails   
and slaughter villages
with a clear head 
where would king arthur be
without guinevere 
happily married  probably 
well  that s a bad example 
but trust me on this 
a woman who loves you   
keeps you going 
gives you strength   
makes you feel
like you can do anything 
is that what your girlfriend
does for you 
sure  yeah 
get out of the fucking way

oh  welcome 
come in 
i ve never been in an apartment
above a store before 
you always walk past them
on the streets   
but you never really think
anyone really lives in them 
can i get you something 
a little coffee  tea 
a little tequila

you re a healthy woman 
you have a steady job 
you re not cross eyed or anything 
  there is nobody special 
  okay  fine 
it s not easy
in this day and age 
what s not easy 
  meeting people 
  oh  god  tell me about it 
i ve been dating longer
than i ve been driving 
i can t believe that 
i have never been through
a dating period 
it s a disgusting process 
you haven t missed a thing 
  hold still 
  i m so excited 
did you feel like this
when you first met anne 
because she s a wonderful woman 
she loves you too much  jack 
but you love her  too  don t you 
you know you do  it s just that you re
a little bit of an asshole sometimes 
sorry 
thanks 
my mother calls once a week
like an ongoing nightmare 
 have you met anyone  
 no  mom  
 what s going to happen  
 i don t know  mom  
thank god i moved out of that house 
i cannot believe you lived with her
as long as you did 
it i had to live with my mother 
i would stab myself six times 
i think some people
are meant to be alone 
this is my idea  that i was born a man
in a former life   
and i used women for pleasure   
so now   
i m paying for it 
i wouldn t mind so much it i could
just remember the pleasure parts 
i think you re getting
a little too complicated 
what  in your opinion 
is the actual problem 
i don t make an impression on people 
at office parties 
i rearrange the hors d oeuvres   
while people are eating them
so the platters will remain full 
i never start any of the conversations
because i just don t know  
i don t know where
to make it end  to go 
listen  you ve got to be
a little easier on yourself  doll 
a conversation
has a life of its own 
you have to have some faith
in that fact 
i mean  look at us 
we re having   
a very lovely conversation 
i m paying you 
will you stop it  i m not like that 
i don t do people favors 
it i talk to you  it s because
i want to talk to you 
all right  you re not a super model 
we can t all be jerry hall 
what a boring world
it we were all jerry hall 
you do the best you can
with what you got 
you re not so invisible 
hey  you want a personality 
try this on for size 
you can be a real bitch 
  really 
  yeah 
i m going to give you my wallet
so you can pay for dinner 
you re a nice man  jack 
doing all this for me 
  i m scared 
  no  no  no 
i feel so much for her 
i feel like something
awful s going to happen 
nothing awful is going to happen 
anne is going to be there 
i m gonna be there 
nothing awful s going to happen  okay 
  i m still scared 
  i know  it s going to be fine 
okay  all right 
you re looking good 
just remember to breathe 
  okay  i gotta breathe 
  big breath 
oh  please  no  stay

  i know 
what have you fellas been up to

  parry  come on

  i d rather go home 
  it s only dinner 
come on 
you re gonna do this 
you ll have something to tell
your mother the next time she calls 
you are coming 
fine 
what do you do 
i get to read the books sometimes 
but mostly i calculate
production costs   
from  
calculation costs from   
first edition hardcover to 
sorry  softcover 
and after softcover  it s basically
somebody else s problem 
that sounds real exciting 
it s not exciting at all 
why not 
i mean  your calculations determine
whether a book is published or not 
maybe it s a book that changes the way
people think or act 
but what we publish
is mostly trashy romance novels 
don t say that 
there s nothing trashy
about romance 
in romance  there s passion   
there s imagination   
there s beauty 
besides   
you find some wonderful things
in the trash 
oh  dumplings 
i could eat all of these 
lydia  would you like a dumpling 
  some tea 
  yes  please 
oh  boy  sorry 
sorry 
it s hot 
help her with that 
what do you think 
i think that they were made
for each other 
it s scary  but true 
i got it  you got it 
there it is  okay 
oh  lydia  oh  lydia
say  have you met lydia
lydia  the tattooed lady
she has eyes that men adore so
and a torso even more so
oh  lydia  oh  lydia
say  have you met lydia
lydia  the queen of tattoos
on her back
is the battle of waterloo
the sight at the wreck
of the  hesperus  too
and proudly above waves
the red  white and blue
you can learn a lot from lydia
when her robe is unfurled
she will show you the world
if you step up and tell her where
for a dime  you can see
kankakee or paris
or washington crossing the delaware
when her muscles start relaxing
up the hill comes michael jackson
did you see her with the noodles 
she had a noodle
hanging down her head 
i couldn t believe it 
come on 
and then they started in
on the dumplings 
they were playing hockey
with the dumpling on the table 
  it was broccoli 
  no  it was a dumpling 
they were batting it around
with a chopstick 
stop or i ll lose it right here 
  yo  lydia 
  watch out 
tell me more about yourself 
i d like to know everything 
  there s nothing more to tell 
  don t say that 
  no  that s it 
  it s enough for me 
  i really think she went for him 
  i know  i can t believe i did it 
what 
it s latin 
it means  love conquers all  
i don t mean us 
i mean everybody else 
  you think it ll work out 
  who knows 
two people could be at a party together
and never find each other 
another two people could be
on opposite sides of the world   
and nothing could keep them apart 
the thing is  if a thing
is meant to happen  
what 
  nothing  go on 
  wait a minute 
you must be very proud
of yourself 
you did a great thing
for somebody tonight 
i was very proud
to be with you tonight 
you were great 
thank you 
you re welcome 
steamed dumplings 
mu shu pork 
you don t have to say that 
you don t have to say that 
i never say anything i have to 
i mean  you don t have to say
nice things to me 
it s a little old fashioned
considering what we re about to do 
  what are we about to do 
  you re walking me home 
  i think you re attracted to me 
  yeah 
and   
you ll probably want to come upstairs
for some coffee 
i don t drink coffee 
and we ll probably
have a drink and talk   
and get to know each other better 
get comfortable 
then you ll  
you ll sleep over 
and in the morning 
you ll awake   
and you ll be distant 
and you won t be able
to stay for breakfast 
maybe just a cup of coffee 
i don t drink coffee 
then we ll exchange phone numbers   
and you ll leave   
and never call 
i ll go to work and i ll feel
so good for the first hour   
and then  ever so slowly 
i ll turn into a piece of dirt 
i don t know why
i m putting myself through this 
it was really nice to meet you 
night 
excuse me  wait  just  
sorry  wait one minute 
excuse me  please wait 
  wait 
  i m not feeling very well 
no wonder  we just met  made love
and broke up in 30 seconds 
and i don t remember the first kiss
which i think is the best part 
it was so special to meet you  
it was for me  too  but i think
it s time you should shut up now 
shut up  please 
i m not coming up to your apartment 
that was never my intention 
  oh  god  you don t want to

you fight your way out that door   
get pushed back in and three
seconds later  come back out again 
i know it it s a good day if you get
that romance novel at that bookstore 
i know what you order  on wednesdays
you go to that dim sum parlor 
i know that you get a jawbreaker
before you go back in to work 
and i know you hate your job
and don t have many friends 
i know sometimes you feel
a little uncoordinated 
you don t feel as wonderful
as everybody else   
feeling as alone and separate
as you feel you are 
i love you 
and i think you re the greatest thing
since spice racks 
i d be knocked out
if i could have that first kiss 
and i won t be distant 
i ll come back in the morning
and i ll call you it you let me 
but i still don t drink coffee

that i think it would be a good thing
for both of us

anne  this has been a real
difficult time for me this past year 
yeah 
and i feel like i m above water
for the first time 
i know a lot more now  and i don t want
to make any more mistakes 
  so 
  i need time to make the right choices 
wait  wait

now that i know more  you know 
i feel that   
i should focus on my career
now that everything s taken care of 
parry s  
let me just say one thing  okay

so what time do you need  baby 
i love you

you want to get your career going 
that s the greatest thing in the world 
i want to be there when it happens 
so what do you need time to figure out 
let me just ask you one thing 
do you love me 
i don t know

jesus  jack 
what were you planning on doing here 
were you planning on packing up   
and dropping me a note
when you meet somebody new 
i had no idea 
i just said i need time 
bullshit 
it you re going to hurt me  hurt me now 
not some drawn out hurt   
that takes months of my life
because you don t have the balls 
okay  i ll pack my stuff tonight 
what have you been doing here 
could you just tell me that 
  we both got something 
  what did i get 
what did i get   
i couldn t have gotten from anybody
with no name any night of the week 
do you think your company
is such a treat 
your moods  your pain  your problems 
you think this has been entertaining 
what do you want to stay with me for 
because i love you 
you stupid tucking  
no  stop it  stop  stop 
don t  no 
you don t get to be nice 
i m not going to play some stupid game
where we act like friends   
so you get to walk out
feeling good about yourself 
i m not a modern woman 
if this is over 
let s just call it over 
yeah 
my wallet 
what do you mean 
parry 
he can t hear you 
i m dr  mandeville 
i was on duty when they brought him in 
i ve been going over his record 
he was in once before 
catatonic stupor 
condition rendered him non verbal 
yeah  so the guy  he s been beat up 
he s got a concussion  right 
right 
he s gonna snap out of it 
i m afraid not 
see  the beating s bad 
but it s not the problem 
he seems to be reexperiencing
the catatonia 
like before  he could
snap out of it in an hour   
or 13 months  13 years 
there s no way to be sure 
a person could actually reexperience
the full effect of a tragedy   
long after the event took place 
i was reading how he lost his wife 
are you relatives 
well  it doesn t matter 
we ll take care of him 
he ll have to be sent back
to the same institution 
what if i was a relative 
you d have the option
to care for him at home   
but i wouldn t recommend it 
it wouldn t be good for him 
he needs hospital care 
i just thought you could sign the
release forms  but the city can do that 
i m sorry 
poor lydia 
she finally finds her prince 
and he falls into a coma 
some women have no luck 
i ll call you  okay 
the answer  two dwarves and a melon 
well  i m out of here 
have a perfect weekend 
and remember  on monday we have as
our special studio guest  ben starr

we spent time together  please

leave me alone 
why 
it s a weekly comedy about the homeless 
but it s not depressing in any way 
we want to find a funny  upbeat way   
of bringing the issue
of homelessness to television 
so  we ve got three wacky
homeless characters 
but they re wise 
they re wacky and wise 
and the hook is they love
being homeless 
they love the freedom 
the adventure 
it s all about the joy of living 
not the bullshit we deal with   
the money  the politics 
and the best part is 
it s called  home free  
i m getting a rush 
what is this 
another disappearing act 
it s not a problem 
it s a bathroom break 
i ll check 
shit 
  parry

i m going to have
my own cable talk show   
with an incredible equity 
i might add 
i ve got an incredible incredibly
fucking gorgeous girlfriend 
i m living an incredible
tucking life 
so don t lay there
in your comfortable coma   
and think i m going to risk all that
because i feel responsible for you 
i m not responsible 
i don t feel guilty 
you ve got it easy 
i m out there every day 
every tucking day   
trying to figure out
what the hell i m doing

so i don t feel sorry for you 
it s easy being nuts 
try being me 
so i won t do it 
i don t believe in this shit 
don t give me that stuff
about me being the one 
there s nothing   
nothing special about me 
i control my own destiny 
not some   
floating overweight fairies 
i decide what i m going to do 
and i m not going to risk my life   
to get some fucking cup
for some tucking vegetable 
you motherfucker 
what am i supposed to do 
cup 
all right  for the sake of argument 
let s say i do do this 
it i do this   
i want you to know it wouldn t be
because i felt i had to   
or because i felt cursed
or guilty or responsible 
it i do this  
it i do this   
and i mean if   
it s because
i want to do this for you 
that s all 
for you 
don t go anywhere 
shit
