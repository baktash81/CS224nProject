it was mr lucass offhand remark
that had fatal impact on mr malnick
marc saffron is on the scene
an afterwork hot spot
babbitts is popular
with single young professionals
edwin malnick arrived
at the peak hour of 715
took one long look at the collection
of the citys best and brightest
then removed a shotgun
from his overcoat and opened fire
seven people were killed before
mr malnick turned the gun on himself
and shot a hole through his head
representatives of radio personality
jack lucas expressed regret
however no formal comment
has been made
neighbors of malnick said he was
a quiet man who lived alone
you scarcely knew he was there said
a woman who lived near malnick 11 years
but today few will soon forget
this lonely man
who reached out to a world
he knew only through the radio
looking for friendship
and finding only pain and tragedy
marc saffron channel seven news
fuck
garbage people are garbage
pigs
go ahead and panic
mr happiness

we sometimes get close to greatness

hey where you coming from
the basement i think
i tell him no visitors
hold it
you a friend of parrys
i dont allow no entertaining
i let him stay here out of the goodness
of my heart because of the tragedy
but im not running a hotel
and nobodys taking advantage of me
tragedy
he and his wife were in some bar
and some nut comes in with a shotgun
and blew the place apart
splattered her brains
all over the walls
she was a beautiful girl
never knew what hit her
you heard about that
that nut who listened to the radio
you couldve been attacked
raped god knows what
i was up all night jack
sorry
a guy wants to check out pornos
so send him back
what the hell happened
i was attacked
what
oh baby
two kids tried to set me on tire
what did they do to you
you almost done are you looking
for a story what
ive seen most of them
creamer versus creamer won an award
go
did you call the police
do you want me to call the doctor
no im fine
are you sure
so where did you sleep last night
i stayed at a friends anne
okay jack i want you
to be up front with me
it youre seeing somebody else
just tell me
you dont have to pour gasoline
on yourself and light a match
just to break up with me
just tell me the truth
i was not seeing anyone else
i really was attacked
ive got a cut here
okay i see it now im sorry
i love you
what are you gonna do
you dont have to say it back
although it wouldnt break your jaw
to try
you know what the holy grail is
holy grail
yeah i know that one
that was like jesus juice glass
yeah i used to be such a catholic
you still believe in god
you gotta believe in god
but i dont believe god made men
in his image
cause most of the shit that happens
is cause of men
no i think man was made
in the devils image
and women were created out of god
cause after all women can have babies
which is kind of like creating
and which also accounts for the tact
that women are attracted to men
cause lets face it the devil
is a hell of a lot more interesting
ive slept with some saints in my day
and i know what im talking about
boring
so the whole point of life
i think
is for men and women
to get married so that
god and the devil can get together
and work it out
not that we have to get married
or anything
god forbid
you have a little thing right here
a pimple
this stuff is supposed to blend with
my skin like it really works
i dont think im up for it tonight
honey
i just had
a very traumatic experience
i know
im getting sick

in a boiler room

when people start pissing on bookstores
asshole
didnt even look at you
well hes paying
so he dont have to look
a guy goes to work every day
8 hours a day 7 days a week
gets his nuts so tight
he starts questioning
the very fabric of his existence
then one day about quittin time
the boss calls him into the office
and says
bob come on in here and kiss my ass
for me will you
he says hell with it
i dont care what happens
i just want to see his expression
as i jam these scissors
into his arm
then he thinks of me
he says wait a minute
i got both my arms both my legs
at least im not begging
for a living
sure enough bobs gonna put
those scissors down and pucker up
im what you call a kind of
moral traffic light
im like saying
red go no further
i do not need this
i do not need this
a woman my age
im a person theres a person here
this is kids stuff
you come you go
all i do is cook like a jerk
youre a waste of good lasagna
i dont need this
find yourself another dope
hes a son of a bitch
god what a beautiful night jack
dont you think its time to go
running around here during the day
is one thing but at night
we could be killed
by a variety of people
thats stupid jack
this park is mine
as much as it is theirs
do you think its fair they keep us out
because we might get killed
yes i think its very fair
i dont
what are you doing
im cloud busting
have you ever done it
you lie on your back
concentrate on the clouds and
break them apart with your mind
its wild but you have to be nude
you cant diffuse the psychic energy
this is new york no ones allowed
to be naked in a field in new york
its too midwestern
its wild its really treeing
the air on your body the nipples are
hard little guy dangling in the wind
come on youre pissing me off
were bareassed naked
in the middle of it
im not doing this this is nuts
im leaving
free yourself you know why dogs
do this cause it feels good
im not doing that
yes
im leaving
come on jack get back to your roots
the man talks to invisible people
he sees invisible horses
hes lying naked in the middle
of central park
im not surprised im out of
my tucking mind to even be here
who are you talking to
im talking to the little people
are they here
theyre saying jack go to
the nearest liquor store
findeth the jack of daniels
that ye may be shittaced
they said that
you are out of your tucking mind
bingo
come on  free up the little guy
let him flap in the breeze
oh jack
nothings happening
concentrate
what it some homophobic jogger
kills us
to get back at his father
jack lucas found dead
next to a dead naked man
the two were dead
his companion was naked
i hate it when they use the word
companion its so insinuating
probably boosts the sales
of my biography
the public is fascinated with celebrity
murders that involve nakedness
bastards
i may be going out on a limb but you
dont seem like a happy camper
did you ever hear the story
of the fisher king
it begins with the king as a boy having
to spend the night alone in a forest
to prove his courage
so he can become king
while hes spending the night alone
hes visited by a sacred vision
out of the fire appears
the holy grail
the symbol of gods divine grace
and a voice said to the boy
you shall be keeper of the grail
so that it may heal the hearts of men
but the boy was blinded
by greater visions of a life
filled with power
and glory and beauty
in this state
of radical amazement
he felt for a brief moment
not like a boy
but invincible
like god
so he reached in the fire
to take the grail
and the grail vanished
leaving him with his hand in the tire
to be terribly wounded
now as this boy grew older
his wound grew deeper
until one day
life for him lost its reason
he had no faith in any man
not even himself
he couldnt love or feel loved
he was sick with experience
he began to die
one day a fool wandered
into the castle
and found the king alone
being a tool he was simpleminded
he didnt see a king
he only saw a man alone
and in pain
he asked the king
what ails you friend
the king replied
im thirsty i need some water
to cool my throat
so the fool took a cup from beside
his bed tilled it with water
and handed it to the king
as the king began to drink
he realized his wound was healed
he looked in his hands
and there was the holy grail
that which he sought
all of his life
he turned to the tool
and said with amazement
how could you find that which
my brightest and bravest could not
the tool replied i dont know
i only knew
that you were thirsty
its beautiful isnt it
i think i heard that
at a lecture once i dont know
it was a professor
at hunter
how come you never asked
that girl for a date
i cant ask her
i have to earn her
this is the 20th century
you dont have to earn a woman
maybe after we get the grail
she could help you get the grail
women are great
they make homes
and they kill the livestock
so the knights can go out there
and get grails
and slaughter villages
with a clear head
where would king arthur be
without guinevere
happily married probably
well thats a bad example
but trust me on this
a woman who loves you
keeps you going
gives you strength
makes you feel
like you can do anything
is that what your girlfriend
does for you

its not so crazy an idea
youre a healthy woman
you have a steady job
youre not crosseyed or anything
there is nobody special
okay fine
its not easy
in this day and age
whats not easy
meeting people
oh god tell me about it
ive been dating longer
than ive been driving
i cant believe that
i have never been through
a dating period
its a disgusting process
you havent missed a thing
hold still
im so excited
did you feel like this
when you first met anne
because shes a wonderful woman
she loves you too much jack
but you love her too dont you
you know you do its just that youre
a little bit of an asshole sometimes
sorry
thanks
my mother calls once a week
like an ongoing nightmare
have you met anyone
no mom
whats going to happen
i dont know mom
thank god i moved out of that house
i cannot believe you lived with her
as long as you did
it i had to live with my mother
i would stab myself six times
i think some people
are meant to be alone
this is my idea that i was born a man
in a former life
and i used women for pleasure
so now
im paying for it
i wouldnt mind so much it i could
just remember the pleasure parts
i think youre getting
a little too complicated
what in your opinion
is the actual problem
i dont make an impression on people
at office parties
i rearrange the hors doeuvres
while people are eating them
so the platters will remain full
i never start any of the conversations
because i just dont know
i dont know where
to make it end to go
listen youve got to be
a little easier on yourself doll
a conversation
has a life of its own
you have to have some faith
in that fact
i mean look at us
were having
a very lovely conversation
im paying you
will you stop it im not like that
i dont do people favors
it i talk to you its because
i want to talk to you
all right youre not a super model
we cant all be jerry hall
what a boring world
it we were all jerry hall
you do the best you can
with what you got
youre not so invisible
hey you want a personality
try this on for size
you can be a real bitch
really
yeah
im going to give you my wallet
so you can pay for dinner
youre a nice man jack
doing all this for me
im scared
no no no
i feel so much for her
i feel like something
awfuls going to happen
nothing awful is going to happen
anne is going to be there

nothing awfuls going to happen okay
im still scared
i know its going to be fine
okay all right
youre looking good

i know
what have you fellas been up to

id like to go now
dont blow this
id rather go home
its only dinner
come on
youre gonna do this
youll have something to tell
your mother the next time she calls
you are coming
fine
what do you do
i get to read the books sometimes
but mostly i calculate
production costs
from
calculation costs from
firstedition hardcover to
sorry softcover
and after softcover its basically
somebody elses problem
that sounds real exciting
its not exciting at all
why not
i mean your calculations determine
whether a book is published or not
maybe its a book that changes the way
people think or act
but what we publish
is mostly trashy romance novels
dont say that
theres nothing trashy
about romance
in romance theres passion
theres imagination
theres beauty
besides
you find some wonderful things
in the trash
oh dumplings
i could eat all of these
lydia would you like a dumpling
some tea
yes please
oh boy sorry
sorry
its hot
help her with that
what do you think
i think that they were made
for each other
its scary but true
i got it you got it
there it is okay
oh lydia oh lydia
say have you met lydia
lydia the tattooed lady
she has eyes that men adore so
and a torso even more so
oh lydia oh lydia
say have you met lydia
lydia the queen of tattoos
on her back
is the battle of waterloo
the sight at the wreck
of the hesperus too
and proudly above waves
the red white and blue
you can learn a lot from lydia
when her robe is unfurled
she will show you the world
if you step up and tell her where
for a dime you can see
kankakee or paris
or washington crossing the delaware
when her muscles start relaxing
up the hill comes michael jackson
did you see her with the noodles
she had a noodle
hanging down her head
i couldnt believe it
come on
and then they started in
on the dumplings
they were playing hockey
with the dumpling on the table
it was broccoli
no it was a dumpling
they were batting it around
with a chopstick
stop or ill lose it right here
yo lydia
watch out
tell me more about yourself
id like to know everything
theres nothing more to tell
dont say that
no thats it
its enough for me
i really think she went for him
i know i cant believe i did it
what
its latin
it means love conquers all
i dont mean us
i mean everybody else
you think itll work out
who knows
two people could be at a party together
and never find each other
another two people could be
on opposite sides of the world
and nothing could keep them apart
the thing is if a thing
is meant to happen
what
nothing go on
wait a minute
you must be very proud
of yourself
you did a great thing
for somebody tonight
i was very proud
to be with you tonight
you were great
thank you
youre welcome
steamed dumplings
mu shu pork
you dont have to say that
you dont have to say that
i never say anything i have to
i mean you dont have to say
nice things to me
its a little oldfashioned
considering what were about to do
what are we about to do
youre walking me home
i think youre attracted to me
yeah
and
youll probably want to come upstairs
for some coffee
i dont drink coffee
and well probably
have a drink and talk
and get to know each other better
get comfortable
then youll
youll sleep over
and in the morning
youll awake
and youll be distant
and you wont be able
to stay for breakfast
maybe just a cup of coffee
i dont drink coffee
then well exchange phone numbers
and youll leave
and never call
ill go to work and ill feel
so good for the first hour
and then ever so slowly
ill turn into a piece of dirt
i dont know why
im putting myself through this
it was really nice to meet you
night
excuse me wait just
sorry wait one minute
excuse me please wait
wait
im not feeling very well
no wonder we just met made love
and broke up in 30 seconds
and i dont remember the first kiss
which i think is the best part
it was so special to meet you

its time you should shut up now
shut up please
im not coming up to your apartment
that was never my intention

you fight your way out that door
get pushed back in and three
seconds later come back out again
i know it its a good day if you get
that romance novel at that bookstore
i know what you order on wednesdays
you go to that dim sum parlor
i know that you get a jawbreaker
before you go back in to work
and i know you hate your job
and dont have many friends
i know sometimes you feel
a little uncoordinated
you dont feel as wonderful
as everybody else
feeling as alone and separate
as you feel you are
i love you
and i think youre the greatest thing
since spice racks
id be knocked out
if i could have that first kiss
and i wont be distant

catatonic stupor
condition rendered him nonverbal
yeah so the guy hes been beat up
hes got a concussion right

hes gonna snap out of it
im afraid not
see the beatings bad
but its not the problem
he seems to be reexperiencing
the catatonia
like before he could
snap out of it in an hour
or 13 months 13 years
theres no way to be sure
a person could actually reexperience
the full effect of a tragedy
long after the event took place
i was reading how he lost his wife
are you relatives
well it doesnt matter
well take care of him
hell have to be sent back
to the same institution
what if i was a relative
youd have the option
to care for him at home
but i wouldnt recommend it
it wouldnt be good for him
he needs hospital care
i just thought you could sign the
release forms but the city can do that
im sorry

of bringing the issue
of homelessness to television

homeless characters
but theyre wise
theyre wacky and wise
and the hook is they love
being homeless
they love the freedom

its called home free
