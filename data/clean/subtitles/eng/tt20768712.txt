well  technically 
the courts are closed 
so it s just me
and judge walker 
my restaurant s closed  too 
they said it might be
two whole weeks 
okay  i figured it out 
why am i a potato 
ay  ay  ay 
shall we talk about
normal people 
something we have
very little experience with 
hey 
how do i stop being a potato 
one thing s for sure 
it went on longer
than anyone imagined 
ah  untamed 
the harrowing true story
of viv s nether region
if the waxing salon
doesn t reopen soon 
all that s been lasered away
years ago 
yeah 
excuse me  um  it s 7 00 p m 
oh  my   
thank you  health care workers

no one s enjoying their
quarantine more than you  viv 
we stayed connected
and were there for each other
through personal hardships 
look who s home
from the hospital 
bruce  you look great 
a minor heart attack 
i m doing fine 
we re just taking it easy 
 no more cheeseburgers 
 mm hmm 
oh  yeah  but look 
got these special cookies 
they re shaped like an aorta 
ugh 
no 
and through
professional milestones 
ta da 
i ve already been asked
to perform three weddings 
once you take senior status 
that s all you re good for 
 that s so sweet 
 it s degrading 
i didn t go to law school
so i could tell
the children of my colleagues
they could kiss 
and like so many people 
the time apart gave us the
opportunity to try new things 
that was a little dark  but   
i m pickling my own cucumbers 
oh  oh 
i have adopted a rescue parrot 
his name is sylvester 
are you a good boy 
sylvester s been rehomed 
and forced us
to deal with things
we d been putting off 
this is all i m keeping 
well  good you re hanging on
to that coffee can  though 
oh 
this is harry 
harry 
well  yeah  the ashes 
the the ashes of harry  see 
was his dying wish
to be a latte 
you you can t just
leave him there 
wait a minute 
do you think he s better off
on the mantel
in mitchell s bedroom 
probably not
what your late husband imagined
as his eternal resting place 
back in the box you go 
there you go 
no  go spread them somewhere 
well  what am i supposed to do 
i mean  i m just supposed to go
dump him in the fields 
he s allergic to horses 
for a while  it felt like
it was never going to end 
i liked this 
but if i wanted to read a story
of a woman trapped at home 
slowly going crazy 
i would ve read my own diaries 
but everything
comes to an end at some point 
we had a great run  didn t we 
it was the best restaurant
in brentwood 
it was the best
restaurant in los angeles 
 yeah  definitely 
 that s true 
you guys are nice 
well  i was gonna retire
someday anyway 
come join me on the other side 
it s boring  but it s boring 
yeah 
well  it had been
quite an experience 
but our time apart
was finally coming to an end 
and a new journey together
was about to begin 
knock  knock 
oh  my god 
oh 
this still feels illegal 
oh  no 
 yeah   i refuse to outlaw
the hug 
what s going on here  huh 
have we officially hit the stage
where we cover
our furniture in plastic 
no  this is what happens
when you have
 too much time on your hands 
 yeah 
i actually tried
to retile the bathroom  too 
 oh 
 that did not go well 
 no 
 it s terrible 
 yoo hoo 
 oh 
 judge 
 oh  please

what s going on with the gloves 
are you planning
a jewelry heist 
or maybe becoming
an amateur mime 
or even a professional mime 
 if you put your mind to it 
 uh huh 
now  that would be
an exciting change 
well  actually  there has been
an exciting change 
oh  my 
what s going    what 
oh  my god 
 you re engaged 
 oh  it s gorgeous 
 can you believe it 
 no  i can t 
 vivian 
 oh  i have so many questions 
 when did this happen 
 well   
wait  wait  wait 
come sit down and tell us
 every single thing 
 we need details 
 yeah  okay 
 okay 
oh  my god  viv 
this is amazing 
oh  no 
oh  my god  well  uh  it was
actually    it was last night 
i can t believe
that it was last night 
we were walking back
to the apartment 
and he made some comment
about proposing 
and i made a comment 
 well  if not now  when  
because in another 50 years 
i may not find him
as attractive as i do now 
and right then  we were
in front of a jewelry store 
and before i know it 
we re in the store 
saying   should we do this 
i mean  should we get married  
and we are 
 oh  my god  oh 
 we are 
 please 
 oh 
to viv and arthur 
oh  thank you 
 cheers 
 oh  beautiful 
thank you  my pals 
so  do you have a date yet 
oh  i think i ll go with arthur 
what 
as my date 
do we have to laugh
at her bad jokes
 since she s the bride 
 no  well  i think we do 
 i think that s the rule 
 yeah 
sharon is correct 
look at you 
 is this new 
 well  it is to me 
i assume the man who owns it
purchased it years ago 
oh  well  i m glad your vagina
hasn t claimed senior status 
 who s the lucky sailor 
 not a clue 
i found it in the back seat
of my car  finders keepers 
oh  my god 
i really don t understand
how you make that work 
well  now you know why she keeps
having to get her hip replaced 
people with mechanical knees
should not throw stones 
 oh  oh  my god  you guys 
 what  what 
i have to show you what i found
when i was cleaning up 
cleaning up 
what did it look like before 
look  i think it s an omen 
an omen 
this is from the trip
that never was 
remember  we were all
gonna go to italy 
oh 
oh  italy 
 right 
 oh  my god 
our dream vacation 
before  of course 
i got pregnant
and ruined everything 
pan am 
can you believe
that one of these
used to get us on a plane 
i can t even look at those 
 surprise gianni 
taste his magical
meatballs again  
oh 
  do not live in fear  
 oh  god 
okay  that s not   
  taste his magical meatballs  
 shh 
 do not live in fear  
how big are they 
oh  gianni 
who is gianni 
okay  he was the italian hottie
from my cooking school
a million trillion years ago 
probably fat and bald now 
 i m sorry  i m sorry 
 don t ruin my memories 
anyway  that s not the point 
 the point is i found this 
 yeah 
the travel ban is lifted 
and i think
we should all go to italy 
italy  whoa 
i mean  i barely made it here 
yeah  i i i can t go
anywhere  right 
i m a newly engaged woman 
remember 
oh  that that s it 
we ll make it
viv s bachelorette 
oh  i literally
just got chill bumps 
it s perfect 
you want us to run around italy
like a bunch of teenagers 
the book says ignoring the signs
is what ruins a life 
 we can t reject our destiny 
 yeah 
i love the idea
of drinking italian wine
and celebrating vivian 
but can t we just do that
from here 
i m with shar 
you know  it it doesn t feel
right leaving arthur right now 
and my little ginsburger
has not been feeling well 
 i don t feel good about
leaving her  either   mm 
you know that we might never
have a chance
to do something like this again 
such is fate 
a bachelorette 
and you said you didn t
want to go because of me 
no  well  i mean  yeah 
that s what i said 
but not because of you 
because of us 
 well   
 you know  our relationship 
well  that s not right 
not because of
 our relationship  
because of our engagement 
i mean  my point was
we re engaged 
so if i m gonna run off
to italy 
it should be with you 
well  i d love that 
but just  cause we re engaged
doesn t mean you can t go on
a trip with your best friends 
really 
viv  jesus christ 
actually  that is
saint christopher 
oh  god 
he s the patron saint of travel 
so  if you re planning a trip 
well  this is
the right place to start 
 how about that for a sign 
 wow 
oh  boy 
hello  you ve reached the home
of the retired and gifted 
so   
we need to go to italy 
why are you saying that 
i already told you i can t go 
i wanted to score a few points
by telling arthur
that i wasn t gonna go
because i m being sensitive
to his feelings
now that we re  en fianced  
that s not a word 
 en fianced    a fianced  
i i don t know 
where are you 
i m in a church 
you re in a church 
we re looking for a venue
for the wedding 
you re going to get married
in a church 
hope they don t run
a background check 
i m shocked you didn t
burst into flames
as you crossed the threshold 
the point is  sharon 
now if we don t go 
he ll think i think
he was testing me
and that i don t think
he actually thinks we should go 
i i think
you re overthinking this 
i don t think so 
 i think we need to go 
 ginsie 
 honey  it s sharon  say hi 
 ginsie 
oh  hey  hi  sharon 
i m excited about
your trip to italy 
oh  my god 
oh  shit 
oh  sh sharon 
y you re on speaker in a church 
ginsie 
jesus fucking christ 
uh  i ll call you back 
it s another omen 
i don t understand 
dead like dead dead 
yes  what other kind
of dead is there 
don t cats have nine lives 
ho hold on  sharon s coming 
they think it was just old age 
it s unnatural for your child
to go before you 
aw  honey 
 honey  i m so sorry 
 oh 
well  i m i m just on
with diane 
i ll put her on speaker 
oh  no  no  no 
wait  wait  wait  no  no 
i would just say
the wrong thing 
hi  di 
no  even my name is wrong
at a time like this 
i think this might be an omen 
yes  the universe is conspiring 
i mean  is    oh  god 
is it  is it really 
and even if it s not 
i say we discuss it in italy 
are you serious 
i m retired  my cat is dead 
we re talking about
going to the top
wine producing country
in the world 
yes  i m serious 
let s do this 
i m looping in viv 
we have to go to italy 
you re in  too 
didn t sharon tell you
what happened 
 about her cat 
 no  arthur 
oh  god  did he die  too 
diane 
i was worried there was a theme 
he thinks it would be wrong
for us not to go 
i mean  is that sweet or what 
you should marry that guy 
and i will 
but first  italy 
can you believe it 
you re on your way to tuscany 
ugh  god 
  ugh  
 ugh  i know

in the world to  ugh  tuscany

to the whole thing 
a bachelorette trip 
what are we doing 
well  vivian s getting married

a little bit nuts 
i think it s very romantic 
but it s also nuts 
you got to admit that 
well  you re the one
who s been married before 
you tell me 
no  no  i was pregnant 
it s different 
oh  that s so romantic 
not as romantic as
never getting married at all 
hello

oh  excited 
oh  mm 
mmm

i was so nervous
that we d been robbed 
uh  sir  where can we find
our checked bags 
what do you mean 
 checked bags  
oh  the ones that we gave
to the porters in rome 
i m sorry 
but we don t have any porters 
 uh   
 uh   
wh when did you get rid
of the porters 
1976 
no wonder the porters
were so surprised
when i gave them a tip 
well  it s probably
not every day
that someone gives them cash
to steal their luggage 
yeah  i just can t believe this 
i can t lose that bag 
well  i know
it s annoying  honey 
but it s not the end
of the world 
you don t understand 
it might be good to get you
some fresh clothes 
everything is replaceable 
no  not everything is  no 
okay  diane  i think you re
blowing this out of proportion 
harry s ashes are in the bag 
 what   oh  god 
 yeah 
you brought harry s ashes
to a bachelorette party 
 are you nuts 
 you re the one
that said i shouldn t
leave him in the closet 
so you brought him to italy 
in a checked bag 
 like a serial killer 
 is that even legal 
you re asking me 
 oh  buongiorno 
 oh  yes 
 buongiorno 
 oh  buongiorno 
 yeah 
 hi 
so  we have made the report 
okay  and  uh   
if  uh  anything turns up 
we will let you know 
that s it  because we ve been
sitting here for two hours 
and that s all we re gonna get 
no  that is not all 
uh huh 
i feel very bad for you 
please 
oh  you feel bad for us 
we don t need a man
to take pity on us 
no  your lazy police work
is more than sufficient 
um   
i m just curious 
hypothetically 
if you do find the bags 
will you be going through them 
i don t typically
make it a habit   
oh 
   to go through
a lady s belongings 
oh  that s great  okay  good 
all right 
and thanks again  thank you 
wait  signora 
your dress 
oh  oh  god  shoot  yes 
that s my dress 
thank you so much 
are you here for a wedding 
no  it it s a bachelorette trip 
but my friends took me
dress shopping in rome 
 such nice friends you have 
 yes 
even the critical one 
yeah  well   
signora  per favore 
before you go 
take this 
so we don t have to see
each other again 
well  thanks 
this is tremendously helpful
at this point 
well  it s definitely not legal 
 that s for sure 
 what were you thinking 
i was just trying to do
a nice thing 
i mean  he always wanted
to visit italy 
 aw 
 it s a sweet idea 
 thanks 
 also crazy 
yeah  i can see that now 
on the bright side 
it s much easier walking
without dragging your luggage 
speak for yourself 
this is like a   
a full upper body routine
carrying this thing 
so  remember
that part in the alchemist
where the guy gets robbed
and loses everything 
yeah 
i have no empathy for him
at this point 
yeah  neither do i 
well  he said he had
a choice to make 
he could either see himself
as a victim of a thief   
or see himself as an adventurer
in search of a treasure 
yeah  but we are victims
of a thief 
but we are also adventurers 
ciao  sofia

i can t wait to find out 
yeah  but first   
bedtime 
yeah  yeah 
 i do need my beauty sleep

they re practically unionized 
okay 
 of all the gin joints
in all the towns
in all the world 
she walks into mine  
casablanca 
remember

the not making it to   
i i knew what you meant
that time 
okay  you re going to have
to explain something to me 
 mm hmm 
 you live in a place
where there are no roads

 caffè  signore 
 oh  yes   me 
thank you 
gianni texted me 
 oh  god 
 that bastard 
thought we hit something 
no  no  no  no 
you don t understand 
he sent a bunch of photos of us
from last night 
so

the nudie type pictures or   
 are you nuts  no 
 well   
but bruce is gonna see these 
it goes to my ipad 
oh  god 
 no 
 what 
he    his crazy broken english 
gianni wrote   
how nice it was
for me to rub his dough 
oh  my god 
and and that it was a very
happy ending to his night 
oh  god 
 yowza 
 oh  that s terrible 
 oh  man  shit  shit  shit 
 oh  my god  i love it  more 
got to call bruce 
why isn t it ringing 
 still not going through 
 oh 
it was all innocent  right 
well  yes 
i mean  we flirted 
but i didn t   
rub his dough 
uh   
no 
well  how about his meatballs 
 i m serious 
 oh  no  no  no 
but did you want to 
no 
i just was trying to have
a little fun 
you know  i i can t have fun
like that with bruce around 
obviously not 
no  not like that 
 okay  sorry 
 oh  what    like what  then 
like where i don t
have to be afraid
that my husband s gonna
drop dead any second 
mmm 
i i just    what would it be 
what would my life be then 
it s one thing
to lose that restaurant 
but i just can t lose bruce 
okay  best friends  tough love 
you know you re
the problem  right 
what are you talking about 
you re just so afraid
of bruce dying
that you re stopping
the two of you from living 
seriously  he s probably
thrilled you came on this trip 
the prison guard
finally left her post 
he s probably
getting his first taste
 of freedom  huh 
 yeah 
let the man get
a taste of bacon 
 that s not what s going on 
 isn t it  though 
that is exactly
what is going on 
and you can t see it 
you want the truth 
 you can t handle the truth  
sorry  you set me up 
the truth is  at some point 
bruce actually
might not be here 
and i don t think
that anyone in this car
wants to see you look back
and realize all the time
you squandered
because you were afraid 
so knock it off 
whoa  viv 
 mic drop 
 it s for your own good 
you ve got a wonderful husband
who loves you 
and you re both   
you re alive and you re happy 
stop trying to control
the uncontrollables 
life is unpredictable 
and it s the surprises
that make it worth living 
oh  my god 
we re okay 
everything s fine 
 you know  it s the surprises 
isn t it   oh  god 
tell me  what kind of car
doesn t come with a spare 
that one 
you know  i ve never actually
hitchhiked before 
yeah  well 
in my limited experience 
it helps if someone
actually drives by 
 well  on the bright side   
 mm hmm 
   at least it s not raining 
why do you tempt fate 
well  th there s no such thing
as fate  remember 
is it too soon to talk about
who we re gonna eat first 
i think we all know 
hey 
this is really not good 
yeah  we know 
no  it s really not good 
thank you for that
brand new information 
we need to get to tuscany 
well  yeah  but we don t need
to get panicky 
you know  w we re not
under time pressure 
we can just relax  chill 
i i am relaxed  but we really
got to start walking now 
 walk 
 mm hmm  yeah 
to tuscany 
well  if we leave now 
we can be there by the morning 
so let s just get it up and go

i don t think we should 
yes 
 well  we have to now 
 yeah  yeah  you do 
you have to  what is going on 
 well   
 what 
we need to get to tuscany
because arthur is there
so that you guys
can get married tomorrow 
 excuse me 
 mm hmm  mm hmm 
he didn t want the wedding
to be a burden on you 
so when he heard about
the trip  he hatched a plan 
which was actually
very thoughtful and sweet 
and we re screwing
the whole thing up
by dying by the side
of the road 
w wait just a minute 
arthur is in tuscany 
at the hotel 
and everyone flew in 
and everything is set up 
it s ready to go 
y you don t have to do anything 
except show up 
which was our job 
and we re still gonna make it 
because the wedding is all set
for tomorrow morning 
so  surprise 
huh 
she s not saying anything 
do you think she s mad 
uh  maybe a little in shock 
 viv 
 yeah  just   
wh what are you thinking  slim 
huh 
fuck 
at least she s talking 
 fuck 
 oh  yikes 
a surprise wedding 
and this happens 
you do not see that as a sign 
i mean  a big sign that
this whole thing is doomed 
no  no  it s not 
 we re still gonna get there 
 and that is right 
because at any minute 
a car s gonna come
right down that road 
and we ll be on our way 
well   
and if it doesn t 
because it s   
feels like the world
is conspiring against me 
i mean  look  maybe this really
is not meant to be  guys 
and and i just have to stop
blowing past
all the warning signs 
wait  wait  shut up for a sec 
no  she s making a decent point 
thank you 
shh

you know  and in my defense 
you guys have been
full of surprises 
and come on  you saw the guy 
it s been a while 
but he did have
some exotic dancer like
qualities 
i do think
he missed his calling 
well  we we had a good run 
didn t we 
 hmm 
 i mean  we just pushed past
the point of common sense 
who do we think we are 
the rolling stones 
and we just thought we d keep
rocking forever  ugh 
this needed to happen 
it did  it did 
this is the universe
hitting the eject button
on me and arthur
 once and for all 
 ugh 
best friends  tough love 
stop giving the universe
and fate credit for everything 
you re making a choice 
what 
we re on this trip
not because of fate
but because we re best friends
for 50 years 
we show up for each other 
fate didn t bring us
on this trip 
our love for each other did 
love and the wonderful people
at lufthansa 
it was a nice flight 
you re not marrying arthur
because of fate 
you re marrying arthur because
you put in the hard work 
because you committed to him 
because you love him 
that s a big deal 
and you should be proud of that 
she makes a really good point 
you should definitely
listen to her 
 oh  and not you 
 yeah 
i think things are just
a little bit different for me 
 oh  god 
 what 
here we go 
let me get out my tiny violin 
 what 
 hey 
 whoa 
 best friends  tough love 
you always play the victim 
what are you talking about 
 i m pregnant 
so i can t do this  
or   i m married

 i couldn t even try that
because i m gonna fall flat
on my face  
you do think of excuses
not to do things 
enough  enough

feel better  i m sure 
luckily  that s not an option 
well  well  well 
look who it is 
signora troublemaker 
god  you again 
i should say the same thing 
i have some bad news 
the juicer s broken 
so our juice won t be
fresh squeezed this morning 
comedy  you don t do comedy 
i think you re growing on him 
 rico 
 oh 
look what he got
from trenitalia 
it was turned in
with your luggage tag 
 no 
 oh  god 
you ve got to be kidding me 
the ashes 
so  you re aware it s illegal 
hmm 
 oh  we had a feeling 
 oh  god 
this wedding is doomed 
wedding 
this is a bachelorette trip  no 
a surprise wedding 
her first one 
oh  i m sorry 
you don t have to be
a jerk about it 
i m not  i mean it 
although  in hindsight  i wish
i missed my first wedding 
maybe it s a blessing 
no  this one was meant to be 
well  obviously not 
we re destined to fail 
i m not cut out to be married 
i think we can all
agree on that 
chief  are you happy
you got to be part of the end
of this fairy tale
for this woman 
does that make you feel good 
no  actually 
but this is life 
it s not fair 
it doesn t always feel good 
but what can i do 
no one ever thinks
they can do anything 
i    i m so sick of it 
everyone always just throws up
their hand and says 
 well  it s not meant to be  
it s pathetic 
y you re a police chief 
don t tell me
you got into this work
without wanting to make
a difference  did you 
didn t you think 
 i m the good guy 
i m the hero  
isn t that what you thought 
and and and now what 
nothing  now  that s life  
no 
life is what you make of it 
so do something 
do something brave 
do something unexpected 
but do something 
because you have four women
in a jail cell
who are desperately hoping
for a reason to believe
there s still
a reason to believe 
so do something  goddamn it 
because this isn t the end
of the freaking story 
i have an idea 
 oh  my god 
 oh  you re letting us go 
oh  god 
tell me that clock is fast 
nothing in this country is fast 
chief 
i ve got one passenger
that needs to be dropped off
a little early 
you think you could
make that happen 
that would require a permit 
 oh 
 wait 
or a special   
special police permission 
i know a place 
 go for it 
 huh 
go for it 
you can do it  diane 
careful  diane 
careful 
i can t open it 
the top  it s stuck 
i can t    i    what the

 is that your plan 
 no  no  bruce 
don t even joke about that 
believe me  when i get home 
things are gonna be
so different 
our adventure isn t over yet 
i never should ve told you

if i could snap my fingers

y you should be here 
it s so beautiful 
you don t think the flowers

well  that s better 
 oh  my god 
 hi 
 bruce  you re here 
 hey 
oh  god  i can t believe it 
well  i wasn t gonna miss
the chance to walk
my favorite girl down the aisle 
come on 
unless  of course 
you prefer dough boy 
i ve got his number 
do you want me to call him 
shut up and kiss me 
mmm 
mmm 
oh  this is bruce  sorry 
oh  thank goodness 
bruce is here 
to make it official 
nice dress 
 you like it 
 mm hmm 
 i just found it in the closet 
 mm 
 mm hmm 
 mm hmm 
mm hmm 
wow 
well   
   here we all are 
which is shocking 
and not just because we spent
last night in a jail cell 
it s shocking because
i ve known this woman
since we were 19 years old
and i never thought
there would be a man
she was willing
to walk down the aisle for 
but there is such a man 
and he s well deserved
of that unique achievement 
and of my dear friend s hand
in marriage 
 to begin   
 um  uh  h hold   
can i    can i just say
something quickly 
o of course 
this is your big day 
arthur  is it okay if i talk
to you for just a second
as though i didn t have
this dress on and   
and you didn t have
two rings in your pocket 
sure 
the truth is
i never wanted to be a wife 
you know  i always saw
a wedding ring as a chain 
you know  a   
a one link chain of   
of limitation 
but there is no limit to
the love that i have for you 
you know 
that s what i ve realized 
that s why i m here today 
i love you  arthur 
i love you  i want to move
to new york with you 
i want to walk
in the streets with you 
i want to make love
in the park with you 
well  not the dirty part
of the park 
you know  the the clean part 
with the trees and the grass
and no syringes 
we ve spent a lifetime apart 
now we have to figure out a way
how to squeeze a lifetime
into the time we have left 
and we can do it 
we can 
i choose you  arthur riley 
i choose you today
and every day 
you may kiss the bride 
wait 
aren t i supposed
to say something 
oh  oh  right  sorry 
i i got swept away 
and and now 
arthur with his closing remarks 
vows  whatever  go 
you don t want to be
a wife  do you 
you don t want to be married 
that s what you just said 
isn t it 
yes  i i guess i did  yeah 
there was a part of me
that believed
that you really wanted
to be married  but   
   who was i kidding 
i knew you d do this 
i knew it 
vivian   
i don t need
the title of husband 
and i don t need
the institution of marriage
to know that i m gonna
choose you every day 
i proposed to you
when we were in our 20s
 cause i was so damn in love
with you that i i knew then
that i wanted to spend
the rest of my life with you 
and as luck would have it 
or some divine masterstroke 
we reconnected 
and i ll be damned
if i don t still feel the same 
but a little differently 
oh  i don t love you any less 
and i think i may
understand you a little better 
you re   
like this ring that i m holding 
a complete and perfect circle
unto your own 
and if you re not always free
to roll on your own
the way you want 
then you re not you 
and it s you that i love 
you re my perfect circle 
so  if you ll allow me
a do over 
i d like to ask
my question again 
aw 
vivian  i love you
with all my heart 
that has never changed 
and it never will 
but i just got to know   
will you not marry me 
there s nothing i d love more 
you re supposed to wait
for my cue 
nobody ever waits for my cue 
may you always love each other
as you do today 
i now pronounce you
not husband and wife 
yes 
yay 
oh  my god 
 thanks  man 
 oh  my god 
congratulations 
you handsome devil 
he gets it 
thank you 
we did it 
we made it to the end 
 wait a second  come on 
 what  what do you mean 
 get back up here 
 wait  what 
 get back up here 
 oh 
can we wait one second  please 
hmm 
give me one second 
you said some things back there
about marriage
i ve never heard you say before 
uh huh 
uh  can we pause the music
a second  please 
did you mean what you said  
that love was reason enough  
or were those just words 
mitchell  is this really
the best time 
i think it is 
well  fine  why not 
i guess
it s as good a time as any 
it is 
maybe a few days ago 
it would ve been just words 
but not today 
 mm 
 it s    it s so easy
to believe in things
when we re young  isn t it 
and we can do whatever we want 
and everything is possible 
and then we get older 
and life starts to silence us 
 but guess what 
 what 
 the whisper is still there 
 mm 
and if you pay
close enough attention 
 you re gonna hear it 
 mm 
in my case 
it was a trip with my friends 
and i heard it
in the art we saw 
remember the art 
and the moments
that we shared together 
and the whisper just got
a little bit louder 
and everything started to feel
a little more possible 
and now  here i am standing
in front of the man i love 
surrounded by my best friends
in the world 
and all i can see
is what s in front of me 
 mm 
 so  you want to know
 what i think  really 
 yes 
i think love is reason enough
and the rest of our lives
start today 
so what are we waiting for 
 i m not waiting 
 oh  you re not 
 okay  okay 
 i m here 
oh  boy  i m not sure
how you follow that 
you don t follow that 
you just ride alongside of it 
and you thank your lucky stars
every day that you do 
diane  i ve never   
i ve never been married before
because i never found someone
that made me see
the reason why i should 
don t you dare move 
oh  what 
don t   
arthur  the ring 
i need the ring 
i don t   
congratulations 
uh huh 
 thank you
