of a woman trapped at home
slowly going crazy
i wouldve read my own diaries

well it is to me
i assume the man who owns it
purchased it years ago
oh well im glad your vagina
hasnt claimed senior status
whos the lucky sailor
not a clue
i found it in the back seat
of my car finders keepers
oh my god
i really dont understand
how you make that work
well now you know why she keeps
having to get her hip replaced
people with mechanical knees
should not throw stones
oh oh my god you guys
what what
i have to show you what i found
when i was cleaning up
cleaning up
what did it look like before
look i think its an omen
an omen
this is from the trip
that never was
remember we were all
gonna go to italy
oh
oh italy
right
oh my god
our dream vacation
before of course
i got pregnant
and ruined everything
pan am
can you believe
that one of these
used to get us on a plane
i cant even look at those
surprise gianni
taste his magical
meatballs again
oh
do not live in fear
oh god
okay thats not
taste his magical meatballs
shh
do not live in fear
how big are they
oh gianni
who is gianni
okay he was the italian hottie
from my cooking school
a million trillion years ago
probably fat and bald now
im sorry im sorry
dont ruin my memories
anyway thats not the point
the point is i found this
yeah
the travel ban is lifted
and i think
we should all go to italy
italy whoa
i mean i barely made it here
yeah iii cant go
anywhere right
im a newly engaged woman
remember
oh thatthats it
well make it
vivs bachelorette
oh i literally
just got chill bumps
its perfect
you want us to run around italy
like a bunch of teenagers
the book says ignoring the signs
is what ruins a life
we cant reject our destiny
yeah
i love the idea
of drinking italian wine
and celebrating vivian
but cant we just do that
from here
im with shar
you know itit doesnt feel
right leaving arthur right now
and my little ginsburger
has not been feeling well
i dont feel good about
leaving her either mm
you know that we might never
have a chance
to do something like this again
such is fate
a bachelorette
and you said you didnt
want to go because of me
no well i mean yeah
thats what i said
but not because of you
because of us
well
you know our relationship
well thats not right
not because of
our relationship
because of our engagement
i mean my point was
were engaged
so if im gonna run off
to italy
it should be with you
well id love that
but just cause were engaged
doesnt mean you cant go on
a trip with your best friends
really
viv jesus christ
actually that is
saint christopher
oh god
hes the patron saint of travel
so if youre planning a trip
well this is
the right place to start
how about that for a sign
wow
oh boy
hello youve reached the home
of the retired and gifted
so
we need to go to italy
why are you saying that
i already told you i cant go
i wanted to score a few points
by telling arthur
that i wasnt gonna go
because im being sensitive
to his feelings
now that were enfianced
thats not a word
enfianced afianced
ii dont know
where are you
im in a church
youre in a church
were looking for a venue
for the wedding
youre going to get married
in a church
hope they dont run
a background check
im shocked you didnt
burst into flames
as you crossed the threshold
the point is sharon
now if we dont go
hell think i think
he was testing me

ill put her on speaker
oh no no no

venice is the most special city
in the world
the treasure of italy
the treasure of italy
uh
wasnt the guy in the alchemist
searching for treasure
this is the universe
telling us we should go

telling us to go

mmhmm
ii i thought i did
oh god
ah aha aha
wait wait
oh
oh
thank you thank you
i was so nervous
that wed been robbed
uh sir where can we find
our checked bags
what do you mean
checked bags
oh the ones that we gave
to the porters in rome
im sorry
but we dont have any porters
uh
uh
whwhen did you get rid
of the porters
no wonder the porters
were so surprised
when i gave them a tip
well its probably
not every day
that someone gives them cash
to steal their luggage
yeah i just cant believe this
i cant lose that bag
well i know
its annoying honey
but its not the end
of the world
you dont understand
it might be good to get you
some fresh clothes
everything is replaceable
no not everything is no
okay diane i think youre
blowing this out of proportion
harrys ashes are in the bag
what oh god
yeah
you brought harrys ashes
to a bachelorette party
are you nuts
youre the one
that said i shouldnt
leave him in the closet
so you brought him to italy
in a checked bag
like a serial killer
is that even legal
youre asking me
oh buongiorno
oh yes
buongiorno
oh buongiorno
yeah
hi
so we have made the report
okay and uh
if uh anything turns up
we will let you know
thats it because weve been
sitting here for two hours
and thats all were gonna get
no that is not all
uhhuh
i feel very bad for you
please
oh you feel bad for us
we dont need a man
to take pity on us
no your lazy police work
is more than sufficient
um
im just curious
hypothetically
if you do find the bags
will you be going through them
i dont typically
make it a habit
oh
to go through
a ladys belongings
oh thats great okay good
all right
and thanks again thank you
wait signora
your dress
oh oh god shoot yes
thats my dress
thank you so much
are you here for a wedding
no itits a bachelorette trip
but my friends took me
dress shopping in rome
such nice friends you have
yes
even the critical one
yeah well
signora per favore
before you go
take this
so we dont have to see
each other again
well thanks
this is tremendously helpful
at this point
well its definitely not legal
thats for sure
what were you thinking
i was just trying to do
a nice thing
i mean he always wanted
to visit italy
aw
its a sweet idea
thanks
also crazy
yeah i can see that now
on the bright side
its much easier walking
without dragging your luggage
speak for yourself
this is like a
a full upperbody routine
carrying this thing
so remember
that part in the alchemist
where the guy gets robbed
and loses everything
yeah
i have no empathy for him
at this point
yeah neither do i
well he said he had
a choice to make
he could either see himself
as a victim of a thief
or see himself as an adventurer
in search of a treasure
yeah but we are victims
of a thief
but we are also adventurers
ciao sofia
ciao ciao
welcome back
ladies let me assure you
youre in good hands now
there is nothing my uncle
wouldnt do for this woman
oh thats very sweet
well its true
and youre in luck
because the wedding
we were supposed to throw
this weekend canceled

screaming and crying
and the dress on fire

of course

anything else you need

thank you
thank you
thank you so much
ciao
ciao
yeah
nothing her uncle
wouldnt do for you huh
well there was a time
15 years ago
when there was nothing
i wouldnt have done for him
sexually

hes why i got my knee replaced

okay best friends tough love
you know youre
the problem right

thrilled you came on this trip
the prison guard

hes probably
getting his first taste
of freedom huh
yeah
let the man get
a taste of bacon
thats not whats going on
isnt it though
that is exactly
what is going on
and you cant see it
you want the truth
you cant handle the truth
sorry you set me up
the truth is at some point
bruce actually
might not be here

that anyone in this car
wants to see you look back

you squandered
because you were afraid
so knock it off

the rolling stones

this is the universe
hitting the eject button
on me and arthur
once and for all
ugh
best friends tough love
stop giving the universe
and fate credit for everything
youre making a choice
what
were on this trip
not because of fate
but because were best friends
for 50 years
we show up for each other
fate didnt bring us
on this trip
our love for each other did
love and the wonderful people
at lufthansa
it was a nice flight
youre not marrying arthur
because of fate
youre marrying arthur because
you put in the hard work
because you committed to him
because you love him
thats a big deal
and you should be proud of that
she makes a really good point
you should definitely
listen to her
oh and not you
yeah
i think things are just
a little bit different for me

oh god
this wedding is doomed
wedding
this is a bachelorette trip no
a surprise wedding
her first one
oh im sorry
you dont have to be
a jerk about it
im not i mean it
although in hindsight i wish
i missed my first wedding
maybe its a blessing
no this one was meant to be

were destined to fail
im not cut out to be married
i think we can all
agree on that
chief are you happy
you got to be part of the end
of this fairy tale
for this woman
does that make you feel good
no actually
but this is life
its not fair
it doesnt always feel good
but what can i do
no one ever thinks
they can do anything
i im so sick of it
everyone always just throws up
their hand and says
well its not meant to be
its pathetic
yyoure a police chief
dont tell me
you got into this work
without wanting to make
a difference did you
didnt you think
im the good guy
im the hero
isnt that what you thought
andandand now what
nothing now thats life
no
life is what you make of it
so do something
do something brave
do something unexpected
but do something
because you have four women
in a jail cell
who are desperately hoping
for a reason to believe
theres still
a reason to believe
so do something goddamn it
because this isnt the end
of the freaking story
i have an idea
oh my god
oh youre letting us go
oh god
tell me that clock is fast
nothing in this country is fast
chief
ive got one passenger
that needs to be dropped off

mmhmm
i just found it in the closet
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
wow
well
here we all are
which is shocking
and not just because we spent
last night in a jail cell
its shocking because
ive known this woman
since we were 19 years old
and i never thought
there would be a man
she was willing
to walk down the aisle for
but there is such a man
and hes well deserved
of that unique achievement
and of my dear friends hand
in marriage
to begin
um uh hhold
can i can i just say
something quickly
oof course
this is your big day
arthur is it okay if i talk
to you for just a second
as though i didnt have
this dress on and
and you didnt have
two rings in your pocket
sure
the truth is
i never wanted to be a wife
you know i always saw
a wedding ring as a chain
you know a
a onelink chain of
of limitation
but there is no limit to
the love that i have for you
you know
thats what ive realized
thats why im here today
i love you arthur
i love you i want to move
to new york with you
i want to walk
in the streets with you
i want to make love
in the park with you
well not the dirty part
of the park
you know thethe clean part
with the trees and the grass
and no syringes
weve spent a lifetime apart
now we have to figure out a way
how to squeeze a lifetime
into the time we have left
and we can do it
we can
i choose you arthur riley
i choose you today
and every day
you may kiss the bride
wait
arent i supposed
to say something
oh oh right sorry
ii got swept away
andand now
arthur with his closing remarks
vows whatever go
you dont want to be
a wife do you
you dont want to be married
thats what you just said
isnt it
yes ii guess i did yeah
there was a part of me
that believed
that you really wanted
to be married but
who was i kidding
i knew youd do this
i knew it
vivian
i dont need
the title of husband
and i dont need
the institution of marriage
to know that im gonna
choose you every day
i proposed to you
when we were in our 20s
cause i was so damn in love
with you that ii knew then
that i wanted to spend
the rest of my life with you
and as luck would have it
or some divine masterstroke
we reconnected
and ill be damned
if i dont still feel the same
but a little differently
oh i dont love you any less
and i think i may
understand you a little better
youre
like this ring that im holding
a complete and perfect circle
unto your own
and if youre not always free
to roll on your own
the way you want
then youre not you
and its you that i love
youre my perfect circle
so if youll allow me
a doover
id like to ask
my question again
aw
vivian i love you
with all my heart
that has never changed
and it never will
but i just got to know
will you not marry me
theres nothing id love more
youre supposed to wait
for my cue
nobody ever waits for my cue
may you always love each other
as you do today
i now pronounce you
not husband and wife
yes
yay
oh my god
thanks man
oh my god
congratulations
you handsome devil
he gets it
thank you
we did it
we made it to the end
wait a second come on
what what do you mean
get back up here
wait what
get back up here
oh
can we wait one second please
hmm
give me one second
you said some things back there
about marriage
ive never heard you say before
uhhuh
uh can we pause the music
a second please
did you mean what you said
that love was reason enough
or were those just words
mitchell is this really
the best time
i think it is
well fine why not
i guess
its as good a time as any
it is
maybe a few days ago
it wouldve been just words
but not today
mm
its its so easy
to believe in things
when were young isnt it
and we can do whatever we want
and everything is possible
and then we get older
and life starts to silence us
but guess what
what
the whisper is still there
mm
and if you pay
close enough attention
youre gonna hear it
mm
in my case
it was a trip with my friends
and i heard it
in the art we saw
remember the art
and the moments
that we shared together
and the whisper just got
a little bit louder
and everything started to feel
a little more possible
and now here i am standing
in front of the man i love
surrounded by my best friends
in the world
and all i can see
is whats in front of me
mm
so you want to know
what i think really
yes
i think love is reason enough
and the rest of our lives
start today
so what are we waiting for
im not waiting
oh youre not

how you follow that

you just ride alongside of it
and you thank your lucky stars
