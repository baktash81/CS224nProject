enough sit around rest life
buy freedom
wear stripy legs pride
knowing still possibilities
luxury knowing might given
eased something

scored heart clark
first day walked
sweet smile ridiculous clothes
bad jokes
complete inability ever hide single thing felt
dont think often
want getting sad
live well
live
ill walking beside every step way
love
