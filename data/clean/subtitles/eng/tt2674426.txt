four times a day  to control muscle spasms 
tablets for nerve pain

sleeping pills  if possible

i m not employed by you  i m
employed by your mother

thank you miss clark  for
attempting to entertain me 
okay  clark

  about

well
my mum got me a pair of glittery wellies 
and i refused to take them off 
i wore them in bed
in the bath
all summer long 
my favorite outfit was
the glittery boots and my bumblebee tights 
bumblebee tights 
black and yellow stripes 
oh dear god 
and i really really really
liked having stripy legs 
and what happened to these gorgeous wellies
and the stripy tights 
ah  i outgrew them 
it broke my heart 
and they don t make those tights anymore 
at least not for grown women anyway 
strange  that 
oh  you can mock 
didn t you ever love anything that much 
yes

marian keyes sushi for beginners
interesting choice of footwear 
patrick says  that i make it look
like a leprechaun drag queen 
he was being nice 
don t smile at me like that 
why not 
because i do not know what it means 
where did you pick up your exotic taste 
what do you mean by that 
it can t be from around here 
why not 
because this is the kind of place people come
to when they got tired of actually living 
people here believe think excitement
is a new  please be quiet 
sign going up in the library 
you should be out there 
claiming the world as your own 
showing your leprechaun shoes to dodgy men 
i like my life 
you like everything 
i m happy here 
well you shouldn t be 
you want me to be more like
the girls you know  do you 
who go to london 
to marry someone like rupert 
i believe he s taken 
and ignore the fact that he s shagging
his secretary within five years 
and bitch about him at dinner parties 
knowing that won t leave because
he s scared of the alimony 
and have sex once every six weeks 
and listen to him going on and on about 
how much he adores the children 
while doing nothing to
actually take care of them 
and have perfect hair 
that get this kind of pinched face
and never saying what you actually mean 
and develop an insane pilates habit 
and buy a dog or a horse 
and develop a crush on
the riding instructor 
and would that your husband 
take up jogging when he hits 40 
and buy a harley 
and know that every day 
he goes into the office 
and looks at the young men
and feels like somehow he got suckered 
and leave him anyway 
and come back here 
to give the children a happy childhood 
whoa 
there were a lot of divorced
handovers at the cafe 
i am sorry 
how did you end up in that cafe 
trina made a bet that i couldn t get a job
in 24 hrs 
i proved her wrong 
and you stayed there six years 
way to go 
i was supposed to leave 
i had a place at manchester 
what you were going to study 
fashion  
and why didn t you go 
do you know what i see when i look at you

potential

you only get one life 
and it is actually your duty to
live it as fully as possible 
well you  you need a shave 
if that beard gets any longer 
i ll be picking food out of it 
and i ll have to sue you

freedom   you call this  freedom   
we all agreed to it
not the specifics  jesus 
we made an agreement with will 
six months 
no  i only agreed so
that we had six months 
to change his mind 
i can not believe 
that you are willing to
help our son end his life 
i d rather that 
than risk him trying it again  alone 
it wasn t a cry for help  camilla 
he meant it and you know that 
and this way we can be with him 
supporting him 
loving him 
he s my son 
yes  he s my son  too  
it s his choice 
and this is what he wants 
you know how much pain he s in 
god 
he gave me six months 
we can still persuade him 
and do you think the pretty
waitress is going to do that 
now 
can i have the letter  please 
please 
dignitas
apparently  the shave was your idea

see the horse racing 
the horse racing 
yes  nathan s never been 
yes  it is true 
and besides  i ve got five pounds 
on man oh man at eight to one 
my dad s mate jimmy   
said that he s a sure thing 
just a wild guess
you haven t been racing before
either  have you  clark 
there is a perfect spot 
right  we re so lucky 
are you sure this isn t going to sink 
no  it s fine  it s gonna be great 
thanks  that s alright
yeah 
um 
what 
we need to push 
okay 
whoa sorry 
don t worry  it s only cashmere 
yeah  it s stuck 
it s fine  it s gonna be fine 
  oh  excuse me 
  okay 
hi  hi 
sorry 
do you  would you be
able to help us with the 
 cause we re a bit stuck 
  we re fine 
  we are not fine 
you re very kind
carefully  
how are we doing 
we re doing well  doing well 
brilliant 
i thank you very much 
thank you  thank you 
thanks guys  thank you 
you guys  we re here  it s gonna be fun 
look  look  look  look  look  there he is 
don t you think he looks like a sure thing 
huh  will 
you re going to lose 
how would you know that 
his ears are flat  his coat is dull 
and he s got a funny walk 
great 
so you know everything
about horse racing  too 
no 
i just look  process information 
and i make decisions 
and that horse is definitely
not going to win 
yeah  well  i like him 
sometimes you just have
to go with your gut 
i m gonna go and place my bet 
they re lining up at the gate now 
the start is on us
and they re off 
man o mann  apparently took the day off 
whoa  this is nice 
yes  nothing like being
spoon fed in public 
hello  we want a table for three  please 
of course  if i could just see your badge 
sorry 
this restaurant is for
premier badge holders 
oh  well we 
we ve got the pink badges 
i m sorry  we can only serve
premier badge holders
okay  are there any other restaurants 
well  there s our relaxed dining area 
and there are stalls outside 
the pig in a poke
does a nice hot roast in a bun  
with applesauce 
sharon  can i call sharon 
so it s
a quiet monday afternoon and you ve 
got a lot of empty tables 
we want to buy a really expensive meal 
and we do not want to eat
pork rolls in a stall
even with applesauce 
i am very sorry  you need
a premier are badge 
it s the policy 
ok  ok  ok 
so how much
for a premier area badge 
what would you like  another
ten more  perhaps twenty 
we don t sell badges madam 
this is a restaurant 
you will need to go to the
ticket office to buy it 
louisa 
let s go 
no  no  no  this is not fair 
we ve come all this way 
louisa 
i m not hungry 
no  i m just gonna run and get the badges 
and then we will have our meal 
and you will see that we
we ll be fine once we ve eaten 
  yeah 
  lou 
i think that will wants to go home 
do you know what  sharon 
you can stick your premier badge
right up your relaxed dining area
okay  okay 
everything s fine 
great so we re going to
paralyze your eardrums as well  now 
so maybe horse racing
wasn t my best idea 
but this i think you ll enjoy 
so nathan s never been to a
classical music concert  now 
no  i haven t 
will you please come with me 
i bought the tickets a week ago 
you can say no 
a wind concerto 
i ve been assured it
doesn t involve farting 
there s not chance of jay z 
sadly  his tickets had just sold out 
mozart it is then 
okay  would this
be the right sort of thing
to wear to a concert 
metallica no 
neil diamond possibly 
i thought pat was training tonight 
oh no  he is  he is
i m taking will to a concert 
sorry  you re going on a date

boobs are mostly eye level 
oh  you re so annoying 
you are so going on a
date with will traynor 
get the red dress out 
really 
oh  kapow

the scarf why 
if you are going to wear
a dress like that  clark

would tell a woman how
to wear a bloody dress
here

digging into my collar

believe it or not  i rarely
pack it myself 
okay then

yes  just um  cancelling everything 
you know  don t you 
yeah
i ve been with him two years 
his life is hard 
he hides his pain  when he s with you 
but there have been times
when i ve stayed over 
and i hear him screaming 
in his dreams he s still running or skiing 
still doing things and  
then he wakes up 
and there is nothing i can say to him 
now  i can t judge what he wants to do 
that s his choice 
but that was before me 
yes and i know that he
did pretty much anything
to make you happy 
i want him to live  lou 
but only if he wants to live 
i can t just let this happen 
i can t 
and we are running out of time 
so if i
could come up with
another trick  that doctors would agree to
would you come with us 
yeah

you re not giving me a chance 
i  have become a whole new person
these last six months  because of you 
i know 
and that is why i can t
have you tied to me 
i don t want you to 
miss all the things that
someone else could give you 
and selfishly
i don t want you to look at me one day
and feel even the tiniest big of regret 
or pity 
i would never would think that 
you don t know that 
i can t watch you
wandering around the annex
in your crazy dresses
or see you naked and not
not be able to 
oh god  clark

want to do to you right now 
i cannot live like this 
please will

tonight
being with you

no 
you could have ever done for me 
but i need it to end here 
no more pain and exhaustion
and waking up every morning  
already wishing it was over 
it s not going to get better than this 
the doctors know it and i know it 
when we get back  i am going
to go to switzerland 
so i m asking you  if you
really feel the things you say you feel 
come with me

i thought that you were changing your mind 
nothing was ever going to change my mind 
i promised my parents six months 
and that s what i ve given them 
no  no 
no 
don t say another word 
you re so selfish 
i tore my heart out in front of you 
and all you can say is  no  
and now 
you want me to come and watch 
the worst thing you can possibly imagine 
do you have any idea of
what you are asking

could ever persuade that man
once he d set his mind to something
you can t change who people are

you should try the scent  papillon extreme 
i always did think it
would smell great on you 
  ca va 
  oui  ca va 
merci 
there are a few things
i wanted to say and couldn t 
because you would have got all emotional 
and wouldn t have let me finish 
so  here it is 
when you get back home 
michael lawler will give you
access to a bank account 
that contains enough to
give you a new beginning 
don t start panicking
it s not enough for you
to sit around for the rest of your life 
but it should buy you your freedom 
wear those stripy legs with pride 
knowing you still have possibilities 
is a luxury  and knowing
that i might have given them to you has
eased something  for me 
so  this is it 
you are scored on my heart  clark 
you were  from the first day you walked in 
with your sweet smile and
your ridiculous clothes 
and your bad jokes 
and your complete inability
to ever hide a single thing that you felt 
don t think of me too often 
i do not want you getting sad 
just live well 
just live
