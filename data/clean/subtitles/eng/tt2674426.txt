to raise it in the morning when he gets up
antispasm tablets
four times a day to control muscle spasms
tablets for nerve pain
now you can give him pain killers
if he asks just
try to resist giving him
sleeping pills if possible
because they tend make him a little
well irritable

he might deny it

what happened
my mother didnt tell you
its her favorite story
it was some sort of traffic accident
motorbike
you were riding a motorbike
actually i wasnt
the bike hit me
i am sorry
sorry im being chatty again
and you you need to rest
no
stay
tell me
tell me something good
i used to say that to my dad
but if i told you what he said
back youd think i was insane
that ship already sailed clark
when had nightmares or
something he used to sing
go on
he used to sing the malahonkey song
what
the malahonkey song i
thought everyone knew it
trust me clark
i am a malahonkey virgin
youre gonna make me sing it now
i willillillillished i lillillillillived
in the malalalahonkey land
the lalalalaland where
so i lalala li could plalalalalay
youre insane
your whole familys insane
and youre a god awful singer
maybe dad was better
i think what you mean to say is
thank you miss clark for
attempting to entertain me
okay clark
tell me something else
something that doesnt involve singing
about
anything
well
my mum got me a pair of glittery wellies
and i refused to take them off
i wore them in bed
in the bath
all summer long
my favorite outfit was
the glittery boots and my bumblebee tights
bumblebee tights
black and yellow stripes
oh dear god
and i really really really
liked having stripy legs
and what happened to these gorgeous wellies
and the stripy tights
ah i outgrew them
it broke my heart
and they dont make those tights anymore
at least not for grown women anyway
strange that
oh you can mock
didnt you ever love anything that much
yes
yes i did
marian keyes sushi for beginners
interesting choice of footwear
patrick says that i make it look
like a leprechaun drag queen
he was being nice
dont smile at me like that
why not
because i do not know what it means
where did you pick up your exotic taste
what do you mean by that
it cant be from around here
why not
because this is the kind of place people come
to when they got tired of actually living
people here believe think excitement
is a new please be quiet
sign going up in the library
you should be out there
claiming the world as your own
showing your leprechaun shoes to dodgy men
i like my life
you like everything
im happy here
well you shouldnt be
you want me to be more like
the girls you know do you
who go to london
to marry someone like rupert
i believe hes taken
and ignore the fact that hes shagging
his secretary within five years
and bitch about him at dinner parties
knowing that wont leave because
hes scared of the alimony
and have sex once every six weeks
and listen to him going on and on about
how much he adores the children
while doing nothing to
actually take care of them
and have perfect hair
that get this kind of pinched face
and never saying what you actually mean
and develop an insane pilates habit
and buy a dog or a horse
and develop a crush on
the riding instructor
and would that your husband
take up jogging when he hits 40
and buy a harley
and know that every day
he goes into the office
and looks at the young men
and feels like somehow he got suckered
and leave him anyway
and come back here
to give the children a happy childhood
whoa
there were a lot of divorced
handovers at the cafe
i am sorry
how did you end up in that cafe
trina made a bet that i couldnt get a job
in 24 hrs
i proved her wrong
and you stayed there six years
way to go
i was supposed to leave
i had a place at manchester
what you were going to study
fashion
and why didnt you go
do you know what i see when i look at you
do not say potential
potential
you have to widen your horizons clark
you only get one life
and it is actually your duty to
live it as fully as possible
well you you need a shave
if that beard gets any longer
ill be picking food out of it
and ill have to sue you
for undue distress in the workplace
youre changing the subject
yeah i am
fine
ill let you
youre really going to do this
im uh
really going to do this
my mother will be so happy
yes well
we wont let that put us off
youve got a funny look on your face
please do not tell me you
shaved off my eyebrows
only the one
freedom you call this freedom
we all agreed to it
not the specifics jesus
we made an agreement with will
six months
no i only agreed so
that we had six months
to change his mind
i can not believe
that you are willing to
help our son end his life
id rather that
than risk him trying it again alone
it wasnt a cry for help camilla
he meant it and you know that
and this way we can be with him
supporting him
loving him
hes my son
yes hes my son too
its his choice
and this is what he wants
you know how much pain hes in
god
he gave me six months
we can still persuade him
and do you think the pretty
waitress is going to do that
now
can i have the letter please
please
dignitas
apparently the shave was your idea
nice one looks great
bye
i need you
i know that we need the money
but this is horrible
im basically just on suicide watch
i am not going back

premier badge holders
okay are there any other restaurants

ive been with him two years
his life is hard

when ive stayed over

in his dreams hes still running or skiing
still doing things and
then he wakes up
and there is nothing i can say to him
now i cant judge what he wants to do
thats his choice
but that was before me
yes and i know that he
did pretty much anything
to make you happy
i want him to live lou

another trick that doctors would agree to

i get that this could be a good life
but its not my life
its not even close
you never saw me before
i loved my life
ive really loved it
i cant be the kind of man
who just accepts this
yes but youre not giving it a chance
youre not giving me a chance
i have become a whole new person
these last six months because of you
i know
and that is why i cant
have you tied to me
i dont want you to
miss all the things that
someone else could give you
and selfishly
i dont want you to look at me one day
and feel even the tiniest big of regret
or pity
i would never would think that
you dont know that
i cant watch you
wandering around the annex
in your crazy dresses
or see you naked and not
not be able to
oh god clark
if you had an idea of what i
want to do to you right now
i cannot live like this
please will
please
listen
this
tonight
being with you
is the most wonderful thing
no
you could have ever done for me
but i need it to end here
no more pain and exhaustion
and waking up every morning
already wishing it was over
its not going to get better than this
the doctors know it and i know it
when we get back i am going
to go to switzerland
so im asking you if you
really feel the things you say you feel
come with me
yes i know but
i thought that you were changing your mind
nothing was ever going to change my mind
i promised my parents six months
and thats what ive given them
no no
no
dont say another word
youre so selfish
i tore my heart out in front of you
and all you can say is no
and now
you want me to come and watch
the worst thing you can possibly imagine
do you have any idea of
what you are asking
i wish i had never taken this stupid job
i wish i had never met you
louisa
louisa

fine
merci
oh look at you you look wonderful
you do
great photos of you on the beach
and also swam and everything too right

louisa
louisa louisa
wait louisa please
you do not have to pay me
im sorry
well
sit down josie love please
lou is upset enough
and his parents know
i mean
what kind of people are they
mrs traynor does not
know what else she can do
its his choice
some choices you dont get to make
hes not in his right mind
people who are vulnerable should
not be given the chance to
its complicated mom
it is not its simple
mom
no
you cant be a part of this
its no better than murder
i tried dad
i tried so hard
but i failed
who says you failed
im not sure anyone in the world
could ever persuade that man
once hed set his mind to something
you cant change who people are
then what can you do
you love them
no one could have done more than you
you have a heart as big as that castle
and i love you for it
have you seen mr traynor
they left
this morning
dad have i made a huge mistake
call them
you still have time
do not worry mom will come round
ill talk to her
youre doing the right thing lou
you have to go
you were useless until you met him
hello
hello
hes just through there
okay
maam
oh
thank you
sorry i didnt mean to
the familiar sound of louisa
clark making an entrance
well leave you be
thank you
dont tell me
youve come to prepare my last cup of tea
actually no
im here to kidnap you
i am going to steal you and
im going to take you to um
where
to rio
or my mum and dads i
havent quite decided yet
come here
closer
look at me
please look at me
i cant
tough
i need to see that face
i need to see that face of yours
even if it is all
pink and blotchy
you really are a most
impossible man will traynor
and the world will definitely
be a better place without me
no
no
dont be sad clark
tell me something good
i wish i lived
will you stay
as long as you want me to
can you call my parents in
clark
a few weeks should have passed
by the time you read this
if youve followed the
instructions youll be in paris
in one of those chairs that never
sit quite level on the pavement
i hope its still sunny
across the bridge to your right
you will see lartisan parfumeur
you should try the scent papillon extreme
i always did think it
would smell great on you
ca va
oui ca va
merci
there are a few things
i wanted to say and couldnt
because you would have got all emotional
and wouldnt have let me finish
so here it is
when you get back home
michael lawler will give you
access to a bank account
that contains enough to
give you a new beginning
dont start panicking
its not enough for you
to sit around for the rest of your life
but it should buy you your freedom
wear those stripy legs with pride
knowing you still have possibilities
is a luxury and knowing
that i might have given them to you has
eased something for me
so this is it
you are scored on my heart clark
you were from the first day you walked in
with your sweet smile and
your ridiculous clothes
and your bad jokes
and your complete inability
to ever hide a single thing that you felt
dont think of me too often
i do not want you getting sad
just live well
just live
