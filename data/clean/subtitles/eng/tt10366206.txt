to what do i
owe the pleasure 
my ring 
my freedom 
your ring is gone 
like the elder
before me 
and if you
came here thinking
you could end this
by killing me 
then you
are mistaken 
my death will not
change the outcome
any more than you can
change your nature 
none of us
can escape who we are 
and no one
escapes the table 
and the only way john wick
will ever have freedom
or peace  now or ever 
is in death 
i know 
i m afraid you ve come
a very long way
for nothing 
yeah

there is no mistake 
by order
of the marquis 
vincent bisset
de gramont 
this hotel
has been condemned 
 briefcase clicks 
 thuds 
you have one hour 
 closes briefcase 
he is
expecting you 
can they do this  sir 
the decree is signed
by the 12 members of the table 
giving the marquis
the power of autem imperator 
which means he is
now our judge  jury and   
 knocks the table 
evacuate the hotel 
winston  ned kelly s final words
as the hangman slipped
the noose
around his neck were   
 such is life  
 such is life  
can you imagine
the acceptance 
the defiance 
today is not the day
you will die 
of that 
i am sure 
you have
the unshakeable faith
of david  my friend 
but you shouldn t be here 
this will not be pleasant 
such is life  sir 
 footsteps approaching 
marquis   in french accent 
my father used to say 
 how you do anything
 is how you do everything  
called it the first
and the last rule of life 
 sand falling 
you believe in rules   
mr  manager 
oh  i do 
marquis  and what
of consequences 
of course 
and second chances 
ah  that s where we differ 
you and i 
 sand falling 
second chances
are the refuge of men who fail 
 stirring audibly 
 clinking 
mm   smacks lips 
there are those on the table
who blame this  um 
atrocity on new york 
they believe
it s this city 
the table has indulged this
fucking place for too long 
and look where
that has gotten us 
i shot him 
 chuckling  and yet he lives 
polluting everything he touches 
marquis 
respectfully 
my hotel   
marquis  your hotel 
if i might  sir 
by all means 
the continentals
and their management
are a reminder
to all who sit
beneath the table
that none of us
are above the rules 
and yet we are here 
sir  mr  wick   
we re not here
because of john wick 
he is simply the face
of your failure  mr  manager 
the sand in that glass
is merely an echo
of my remaining patience 
 sand whistling 
 muffled explosion 
you are no longer new york 
 knuckles cracking 
you are nothing 
you are excommunicado 
and as such   
you no longer need
the services
of a concierge 
 gasping 
it has been an honor 
my friend 
 breathing slowly 
 breathing ceases 
it should have been me 
marquis  yes 
but it wasn t 
now  you think about
why that is 
and perhaps one of us
will have benefited
from this conversation

you put her in danger 
 sighs

i know the deal i made 
a former associate  i believe 
he was 
and a friend

where he might be 
john wick has

killing the elder
was a mistake  my friend 
their response
was the destruction of
the new york continental 
my daughter fears
we are next 
winston 
alive  but they executed
his concierge
to prove a point 
have you given
any thought to
where this ends 
the table

the table has
reason to believe
that this facility
is providing services   
 in latin 
that is
a grave accusation 
we will require
full access

of course 
but as you
are well aware 
no business 
not even your kind
of business 
may be conducted
on continental grounds 
so  i m going
to have to ask you
to surrender your firearms 
we speak for the marquis

fools talk

you spoke to him 
you shot him
off a roof 
i had no choice 
they held
all the cards 
no 
but who held the gun 
john needs to know
the breadth of what s
coming at him 
this marquis
is unrestrained 
the table have
let him off the leash 
oh  my dear winston 
your benevolence
is touching 
but tell me 
tell me true 
why did the frenchman
let you live 
killing a man
can turn him
into a martyr 
letting him live   
tells the world
he s a coward
or a turncoat 
so what are you 
aggrieved 
 operatic music playing 
 horses neighing

i fail to see
how laying waste
to continentals
is getting you closer
to killing john wick 
marquis  this campaign
is not to kill john wick 
it is to kill
the idea
of john wick 
and to do that 
i must
destroy everything
that idea touches 
 swords clashing 
the bloodshed
in osaka
was not necessary 
the bloodshed
was the point 
he ll make it
your choice 
you  come with me 
think twice
before accepting 
 horse whinnies 
and you are 
tracker  nobody 
coyness  mr  nobody 
is a pathetic trait 
a miscalculation 
in which by trying
to hide our ego 
we let it appear
stark naked 
i will ask
only once 
how were you able
to locate him 
pay
and i ll tell you 
how much would
such a service
be worth 
twenty five
million 
plus a matching
contribution
to my 401k
when he s dead 
hmm 
we found him once 
we ll find him again 
is that before
or after he puts you
in the ground 
i like you 
twenty million 
like me some more 
twenty three 
ego  mr  nobody 
mm 
it s 23 
you clearly
can afford it 
for the service

taken for our sins 
who is this 
the marquis de gramont

his guarantee
of killing you 
all the resources

are at his disposal 
where do i find him

where will it end 
huh 
with him dead 
oh  and then 
hmm 
have you
learned nothing 
they will replace him
before the body s cold 
hercules had his hydra 
you have the table 
except you ll
run out of bullets
before they
run out of heads 
kill him  but do it
the smart way 
and get him to give you
your freedom 
how 
turn his rules
and consequences
against him 
challenge him
to single combat 
high table duels are a myth 
wrong 
they re a cold
hard fact 
and part of the foundation
of the table
to stop its more
combustible members
from outright war 
it s also 
win or lose 
what you say you want 
a way out 
i don t sit at the table 
your family does 
get them to issue
the challenge
and then offer you up
as proxy 
i don t have a family 
the ruska roma
tore my ticket 
then i suggest
you get your ass

you see  that s why
i never trust the cossacks 
they are dirty people 
 snickers 
this is personal 
i sense tension here 
mr  wick may
probably feel
i m responsible
for the death of a   
mutual friend 
but i didn t kill koji 
you did  john 
killa  you know 
this discord
between old friends 
it saddens me

what about

 killa chuckling  oh 
for pyotr  of course  ja 
but it looks like
we have ourselves  uh 
a genuine conundrum   chuckles 
a quandary  if you will 
a real life dilemma 
 chuckles 
 killa continues  so   
how about we play a game 
one hand 
the winner decides who lives   
and who does not 
 killa chuckling 
 chuckles softly 
all right 
what s the buy in 
more than you can afford

killa  ah  royal flush 
pretty good for a nobody 
thank you 
a blind man 
a guy with a dog
and john wick walk into a bar
and take a seat at the table 
that either sounds
like the beginning
of a stupendous joke
or a most
profitable opportunity 
 chuckles 
one thinks he can
serve his way out 
one   
thinks he can
buy his way out 
and one   
thinks he can kill
his way out 
each of them all think
that they have
the winning hand 
but what they fail
to realize
is that the moment they took
a seat at the table   
they had already lost 
let me guess

marquis  you must intend
to join your concierge 
winston  not today 
per the old ways
and the old laws 
john wick calls you to a duel 
to settle your differences
the old fashioned way 
as gentlemen should 
you speak of the old ways
as if you know them 
a man of mr  wick s
station
cannot issue
such a challenge 
he has
his family s crest 
marquis  hmm 
berlin 
ruska roma challenge 
the acceptance
of mr  wick
back into the fold 
it s all there 
recorded history now 
and why would i
accept this
from a second rate seat 
because there
are rules 
and without them   
we live with
the animals 
exactly 
marquis  mm 
times are changing 
a new day is dawning 
new ideas  new rules 
new management 
yet you will accept 
because we all still sit
beneath the table 
even you are not immune
to the consequences of failure 
and what exactly
are mr  wick s terms 
victoriae fiducia 
the unconditional release
of any and all obligations
to the table 
ah  history is littered
with marquis
who were
only remembered
by their servants 
but you   
you could
be remembered
as the man who brought
john wick 
the most
feared of all
by the table
and all who sit at it 
into the light 
your light 
and who could predict
how high
that kind of glory
could take a man
in our world 
noon  la tour eiffel 
to discuss rules 
you may go 
when i m done 
as his second 
upon his victory 
my excommunicado
is to be lifted 
my title restored 
my hotel rebuilt
and re consecrated 
all at
the table s expense 
of course 
 in french 
how you do anything
is how you do everything 
now i m done 
i think i ll miss you
when you re gone 
shame i can t
say the same 
you don t know 
do you 
what s that 
a man s second 
like his sponsor 
either walks out
with his champion
or is buried beside him 
the old ways 
such is life 
 bell tolling 
harbinger  under the old laws 
only one can survive 
do you both
understand that 
 continues  very good 
rules 
the challenged
chooses first  time 
sunrise 
now 
harbinger  sunrise 
location 
you come here
thinking there is
a way out of this world
for you  mr  wick 
there is not 
le centre pompidou 
sacré coeur 
sacré coeur 
weapons 
if you win 
the table will
honor its word 
you will have
your freedom 
but you won t take it 
blades 
pistols 
harbinger  dueling pistols 
thirty paces 
in the event that
both parties survive 
each will approach the other
at increments of ten paces
until only one remains 
rules of engagement 
no quarter 
marquis  you know why
you won t take
your freedom 
hmm 
because this
is who you are 
who you ve
always been 
you are a killer 
an orphan we plucked
from the street
and honed into a knife 
and it is the killing
that gives you purpose 
a man
without purpose   
is nothing 
no quarter 
harbinger  no quarter 
if there is nothing else 
gentlemen 
i will see   
a nomination 
it is his right 
harbinger 
do you have a name 
caine 
harbinger  so be it 
sunrise  sacré coeur 
dueling pistols 
no quarter 
should mr  wick
be victorious 
he will be free of any
and all obligation
to the high table 
and his second
will be reinstated
as the manager
of the rebuilt
new york continental 
should the marquis
vincent bisset de gramont
be victorious   
john wick will be dead 
as will his second 
harbinger  just so 
now  if there is
nothing more  gentlemen 
i will see you
at sunrise 
failure to meet
at the appointed hour
will result
in forfeiture
and immediate execution 
there is no john
out there 
no happy husband
with a normal life 
there s only john wick 
the killer 
and he s going to kill you 
 taps cane 
john  your hotel 
yes 
you always have
an angle  don t you 
doesn t everyone 
let s find safe harbor
before it starts 
there s something
i need to do first 
sooner rather
than later 
won t do it 
you fight
your own fight 
isn t this
what you want 
hmm 
victoriae fiducia 
you kill him 
and you and your
daughter will be free 
no one can touch her 
if you don t 
she will have to face
the consequences 
the choice is yours 
caine 
john 
saying goodbyes 
saying hello 
you think your wife
can hear you 
no 
then why bother 
maybe i m wrong 
the dead are gone 
only the living matter 
after my daughter was born   
i wanted to leave this life 
 tune playing on watch 
i thought i did 
but you didn t 
we re damned   
you and i 
on that we agree 
 music stops 
my daughter s not 
if it s between
you and her   
you re going to die 
maybe not 
i missed you  john 
it s so good
to sit with a friend 
i ll see you
tomorrow 
 water splashing 
this is how you
resolve the situation 
duello with
the baba yaga 
failure will shake
the foundation
of the high table 
and it will turn wick
into a saint 
my victory will
do the opposite 
 harbinger scoffs 
marquis de gramont 
a man s ambition
should never exceed his worth 
you would do well
to remember that  sir 
 sentimental
french song playing 
 muffled french song
continues playing on radio 
 train approaching 
bonjour 
monsieur wick 
and welcome
to la resistance 
a little far from home 
aren t you 
well  your little act
of uncivil disobedience
inspired me  john 
i m branching out 
spreading my wings 
how goes the grand
farewell tour 
coming to an end 
so it seems  so it seems 
forty two regular 
wasn t it 
it s kevlar 
front to back 
the latest
in ballistic chic 
appropriate for
all formal occasions 
weddings  funerals 
high table duels 
after all  a man
has to look his best
when it s time
to get married 
or buried 
forgive me  sir 
but this is madness 
madness 
trusting your fate
to a blind man 
there are three types
of men in this world 
those who
have something
to live for 
those who
have something
to die for 
and those who
have something
to kill for 
john wick has
none of these things 
he is but a ghost
in search of a graveyard 
but the blind man 
well  he has all three 
besides  i have a feeling
mr  wick will never make it
to the duel by sunrise 
 in spanish 
 upbeat rock music playing 
all right  now 
for all you boppers out there
in the city of lights 
for all you street people
with an ear for the action 
to all my loyal listeners
who know the beat
of the street   
 turns up radio 
   tonight is your chance
to make some beautiful music 
i ve been asked
to relay a special request
from a secret admirer 
it seems there s a thorn
in our little
slice of paradise 
a wicked man from the big apple
is making a beeline
to our sacred heart 
we are putting the call out
to deliver your hardest beats
to this man in black 
if you want the prize 
you must finish before sunrise 
this golden oldie 
and i do mean golden hit 
goes out to you  mr  wick 
and remember 
there is nowhere to run
