he has a paw on everything
bomposa makes the rules of the game
there are three different outposts
trying to get him
but that is not enough cf
not this time
i think you have to take the law
into your own hands
it is not enough to close it
you have to kill him
i dont want to hear this
now back off
the department takes care of everything

which department has so much money
connections lawyers
they didnt do anything
to shut up these bastards
ill take care of it myself

what are you thinking about
we are reflecting on the same cf
how much have you already got
you can trust us
give me the reason
they said the boy would be a
vegetable if he lived
we think youll want
to do something about it
youre doing a good job
just to make your job easier
bomposa made a donation
to a new england university
you know he s the
chief advisor there lieutenant
the car has probably
been blown up by someone outside
now she is watering the flowers or swimming
in concrete swimming pools
anyway
its beyond your reach
anything else
yes we want to show you the movie
miss pruitt what
is your relationship with joe bompos
do you work for him
no sir
live with him
its too personal
to talk on tv
you dont have to answer
do i have to answer
yes miss pruitt
miss pruitt are you living with him
well not so completely
mam na myœli ³óko
mr bomposa is like a
father to me
were you a purse
what does it mean
not a gift certificate
for bamposy z nevady do miami
and at that time mr bamobsa
was not chairing the meeting
with the seven heads of
organized crime
in new york in 1974
i dont know anything about joes business
and i dont want to know anything
you have to answer
what can you do to me
arrest you for offending
wait i didnt offend the senate
i voted for you senator
i will repeat the question
why did he pay for rent
trips clothes
because im the best in town
this is the kind of chick
that the bompos like to have
what is the fbi up to
your boss wants you to take a
few days off
what for
you wanna get joe bampose
i want to but i wont get him while
im on vacation
we know how to do it
the girl will be the guarantor
weve been looking for her all the time
since that hearing
we found her two days ago
so where is the problem
take her
we cant hes in switzerland
they pay the fbi people for it
we know that some bosses
did not like her speech
shes not very smart
but she knows too much about their affairs
it may be a
threat to them
bomposa gave her temporary
shelter in switzerland
it is guarded by an old thief
and two sicilians
only then does he have a chance to survive
i repeat the question
whats the problem
get her out of there
the fbi cannot legally
operate outside the us
im beginning to understand
you need a volunteer
yeah but youre the cop from phoenix
that nobody knows
this way we can
organize the whole thing
how do i think she will change her mind
and testify
he will change his mind
when he falls into our hands
how did you find her
by the guardian angel
hes an old fart lobo
i want to exchange it
for a new identity
start a new life
we have his file
he has to convince
her that the escape is in her interest
and if she refuses
youre creative charlie
you will convince her
the seat belt indicator
is now off
lets talk a little
andy minton thinks he
must be close to you
if necessary
i will not need you

off fingers and toes
i dont care
no one is going to cut anything off jackie

this bastard wants more money

how much does he want
can you believe that a million dollars
wants a million dollars
not a petty guy
he says he saw a girl 10 minutes ago
he would finish her in an hour
if you transfer money
to switzerland tomorrow morning
this means he is an amateur
not a businessman
do you know what well do
let him do the job
and then i whistle
on money
forget about it
he was expecting something like this
he plans to kill the cop
and put the girl in pledge
he is however a businessman
finish the job
after receiving the money
joe what do you tell him
okay tell him hell

but tell him from me
number one
ill never forgive him
number two
i never forget
how do you think i
look elegant
