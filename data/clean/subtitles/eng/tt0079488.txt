bad stuff on the street  uncut 
  she s the third od we ve had this week  
  keep me informed will you 
  the hell are you doing  
  leave me alone  lieutenant 
  i asked you a question  
  i m not kidding  just back off 
what s your name  durant  
look around sometimes 
will you cool down
before i shove you against the glass 
what s going on 
that girl back there    
she was my old lady 
i m gonna marry her

  they addicted her to heroin     
  calm down 
i watched him 
when i was off 
i know where he goes  he hangs out 
when he s home 
  who are you talking about  
  about joe bomposa 
you know what s going on here    
he has a paw on everything  
bomposa makes the rules of the game 
there are three different outposts 
trying to get him 
but that is not enough  cf  
not this time 
i think you have to take the law 
into your own hands 
it is not enough to close it  
you have to kill him 
i don t want to hear this 
now  back off 
  the department takes care of everything  
  department  sure 
which department has so much money  
connections  lawyers 
they didn t do anything 
to shut up these bastards 
  i ll take care of it myself  
  what about you 
leave it to me  
i say this from experience 
looks like i m sipping my coffee 
and talking to myself 
do you want to get a warning  
then remember what i say
if anything happens  bomposa  
i ll come to you 
durant 
please give me a word to let 
go 
doctor  i was told he survived  
can i see him 
no point  he is unconscious 
in intensive care 
what condition is he in 
if he survives  
he will be without arms and legs 
œwiêty bo s e 
check registration of vkt981 
  they belong to the government  lieutenant  
  okay  wait here 
okay  
what are you thinking about 
we are reflecting on the same  cf  
how much have you already got 
  you can trust us  
  give me the reason 
they said the boy would be a 
vegetable if he lived 
we think you ll want 
to do something about it 
  you re doing a good job  
  just to make your job easier 
bomposa made a donation 
to a new england university 
you know he  s the 
chief advisor there  lieutenant 
the car has probably 
been blown up by someone outside 
now she is watering the flowers or swimming 
in concrete swimming pools 
anyway  
it s beyond your reach 
anything else 
yes  we want to show you the movie 
miss pruitt  what 
is your relationship with joe bompos 
  do you work for him  
  no  sir 
live with him 
it s too personal 
to talk on tv 
you don t have to answer 
  do i have to answer  
  yes  miss pruitt 
miss pruitt  are you living with him  
  well  not so completely 
mam na myœli ³ó ko 
mr  bomposa is like a 
father to me 
  were you a  purse   
  what does it mean 
not a gift certificate 
for bamposy z nevady do miami 
and at that time mr  bamobsa 
was not chairing the meeting
with the seven heads of 
organized crime
in new york in 1974 
i don t know anything about joe s business 
  and i don t want to know anything 
  you have to answer  
  what can you do to me 
arrest you for offending 
wait  i didn t offend the senate  
i voted for you  senator 
i will repeat the question 
why did he pay for rent  
trips  clothes 
because i m the best in town 
this is the kind of chick 
that the bompos like to have 
what is the fbi up to 
your boss wants you to take a 
few days off 
  what for  
  you wanna get joe bampose 
i want to  but i won t get him while 
i m on vacation 
  we know how to do it  
  the girl will be the guarantor 
we ve been looking for her all the time 
since that hearing 
we found her two days ago 
so where is the problem  
take her 
  we can t  he s in switzerland  
  they pay the fbi people for it 
we know that some bosses 
did not like her speech 
she s not very smart  
but she knows too much about their affairs 
it may be a 
threat to them 
bomposa gave her temporary 
shelter in switzerland 
it is guarded by an old thief 
and two sicilians 
  only then does he have a chance to survive  
  i repeat the question 
what s the problem  
get her out of there 
the fbi cannot legally 
operate outside the us 
i m beginning to understand  
you need a volunteer 
yeah  but you re the cop from phoenix 
that nobody knows 
this way we can 
organize the whole thing 
how do i think she will change her mind 
and testify 
he will change his mind 
when he falls into our hands 
  how did you find her  
  by the guardian angel 
he s an old fart  lobo 
i want to exchange it 
for a new identity 
start a new life  
we have his file 
he has to convince 
her that the escape is in her interest 
  and if she refuses  
  you re creative  charlie 
you will convince her 
the seat belt indicator 
is now off    
let s talk a little 
andy minton thinks he 
must be close to you 
if necessary 
i will not need you 
don t play with me  
i told you i don t need you 
  we just want to help  
  there s no need to 
and now mommy s boy will 
pee politely outside 
naughty boy 
lobo  
i want to talk about richie 
he is always watching me 
and saying nothing 
no  baby  he s watching me  
joe keeps an eye on everything 
do you like it 
cool  no  i get 
nice clothes too  huh 
  any messages

  who are you

you are very careful 
usi¹d  
heavy artillery for such 
a small town 
it s a habit     
from the old days 
okay  tell me 
it won t be easy 
these two sicilian savages 
don t have much sense 
they are unrepentant pennies  
very greedy 
but this guy  richie  
you gotta watch out for him 
blood makes him happy  
murder is a piece of cake for him 
what does the girl know about me  
who am i 
you re nick costa  
a bomposa favorite 
she knows the name 
but has never seen the face 
nobody saw 
him except the bompos 
i always thought he would look 
like you 
to by³ komplement 
well  of course  dziêkujê 
now let me take care of it 
don t press too hard  
this is the first league 
you re going to need a lot of luck 
  work your head 
goodbye 
  hello

this bastard wants more money 
i want to be friendly

wants a million dollars 
not a petty guy 
he says he saw a girl 10 minutes ago  
he would finish her in an hour 
if you transfer money 
to switzerland tomorrow morning 
this means he is an amateur  
not a businessman 
do you know what we ll do  
let him do the job
and then i whistle 
on money 
forget about it  
he was expecting something like this 
he plans to kill the cop 
and put the girl in pledge

finish the job 
after receiving the money 
joe  what do you tell him 
okay  tell him he ll 
have what he wants
but tell him from me 
number one  
i ll never forgive him
number two  
i never forget 
how do you think i 
look elegant 
toilet smells 
see what i look like 
why did they send a cop 
from phoenix

what does it mean 
meaning 
that when i get joe bombose

the state department intervened 
the swiss are furious as hell
