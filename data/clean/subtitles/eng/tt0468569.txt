yeah well good thing about the mob
is they keep giving you second chances
lightly irradiated bills
fancy stuff for a city cop have help
we liaise with various agencies
save it gordon i wanna meet him
official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as batman on sight
mmhm what about that floodlight
on the top of mcu
if you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment
i suggest you take them up
with maintenance counselor
ive put every money launderer
in gotham behind bars
but the mob
is still getting its money out
i think you and your friend
have found the last game in town
youre trying to hit them
where it hurts their wallets
its bold
you gonna count me in
in this town the fewer people know
something the safer the operation
gordon i dont like that you got
your own special unit
and i dont like that its full of cops
i investigated at internal affairs
if i didnt work with cops youd investigated
while you were making your name at ia
id be working alone
i dont get political points
for being an idealist
i have to do the best i can with what i have
you want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks
without telling me what were after
i can give you the names of the banks
well thats a start
ill get you your warrants
but i want your trust
oh you dont have
to sell me dent
we all know youre gothams
white knight
yeah well i heard they have
a different name for me down at mcu
i wouldnt know about that
in china lau security investments
stands for dynamic new growth
a joint chinese venture with
wayne enterprises will be a powerhouse
well mr lau
i speak for the rest of the board
and mr wayne
in expressing our own excitement
sir i know that mr wayne is curious
about how his trust fund gets replenished
but frankly this is embarrassing
you worry about the diligence
mr reese
ill worry about bruce wayne
its done
the numbers are solid
do them again
wouldnt want the trust fund to run out
now would we
another long night
this joint venture was your idea
and the consultants love it
but im not convinced
laus company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork
his revenue stream
must be off the books
maybe even illegal
okay cancel the deal
you already knew
just needed a closer look at their books
anything else you can trouble me for
i need a new suit
yeah three buttons
is a little 90s mr wayne
im not talking fashion mr fox
so much as function
you wanna be able to turn your head
sure make backing out
of the driveway easier
ill see what i can do
took me three weeks
to get a reservation here
and i had to tell them
i work for the government
really
the city health inspectors
not afraid to pull strings
rachel fancy that
yeah bruce fancy that
rachel natascha natascha rachel
natascha are you the prima
prima ballerina for the moscow ballet
wow harveys taking me next week
really so youre into ballet
bruce this is harvey dent
the famous bruce wayne
rachels told me everything about you
i certainly hope not
so lets put a couple of tables together
im not sure that theyll let us
oh they should i own the place
how could you want to raise children
in a city like this
well i was raised here
i turned out okay
is wayne manor in the city limits
is hehheh
the palisades sure
you know as our new da
you might wanna figure out
where your jurisdiction ends
im talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante
gotham city is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for whats right
gotham needs heroes like you
elected officials
not a man who thinks
hes above the law
exactly who appointed the batman
we did all of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city
but this is a democracy harvey
when their enemies were at the gates
the romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city
it wasnt considered an honor
it was considered a public service
harvey the last man
that they appointed
to protect the republic
was named caesar
and he never gave up his power
okay fine
you either die a hero
or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain
look whoever the batman is he doesnt
wanna do this for the rest of his life
how could he batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle
someone like you mr dent
maybe if im up to it
what if harvey dent
is the caped crusader hm
if i were sneaking out every night
someone wouldve noticed by now
well im sold dent
and im gonna throw you a fundraiser
thats nice of you bruce but im not
up for reelection for three years
no you dont understand
one fundraiser with my pals
youll never need another cent
what the hell is this
as youre all aware
one of our deposits was stolen
a relatively small amount 68 million
whos stupid enough to steal from us
twobit wackjob
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup
hes not the problem hes a nobody
the problem is our money
being tracked by the cops
thanks to mr maronis
wellplaced sources
we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills
and are planning to
seize your funds today
and since the enthusiastic new da has
put all my competitors out of business
im your only option
so what are you proposing
moving all deposits to
one secure location not a bank
where then
no one can know but me
if the police were to gain leverage
over one of you
everyones money would be at stake
what stop them getting to you
i go to hong kong
far from dents jurisdiction
and the chinese will not extradite
one of their own
how soon can you move the money
i already have
for obvious reasons i couldnt wait
for your permission
rest assured your money is safe
oh heehee aha
ha ooh hee ha haha
and i thought my jokes were bad
give me one reason why i shouldnt
have my boy here pull your head off
how about a magic trick
im gonna make this pencil disappear
tada
its
its gone
oh and by the way
the suit it wasnt cheap
you ought to know you bought it
sit
i want to hear proposition
lets wind the clocks back a year
these cops and lawyers
wouldnt dare cross any of you
i mean what happened
did your balls drop off hm
you see a guy like me
a freak
damn right
a guy like me look listen
i know why you choose
to have your little ahem
grouptherapy sessions
in broad daylight
i know why youre afraid
to go out at night
the batman
see batman has shown gotham
your true colors unfortunately
dent hes just the beginning
and as for the televisions
socalled plan
batman has no jurisdiction
hell find him and make him squeal
i know the squealers when i see them
and
what do you propose
its simple we uh kill the batman
if its so simple why havent
you done it already
if youre good at something
never do it for free
how much you want
uh half
youre crazy
no im not
no im not
if we dont deal with this now
soon
little gambol here wont be able
to get a nickel for his grandma
enough from the clown
ah tatata lets not blow
shit
this out of proportion
you think you can steal from us
and just walk away
yeah
im putting the word out
five hundred grand for this clown dead
a million alive so i can teach him
some manners first
all right so listen
why dont you give me a call
when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously
heres my card
mmmm
youre a hard man to reach
laus halfway to hong kong
if youd have asked i could have taken his passport
i told you to keep me in the loop
all that was left in the vaults
were marked bills
they knew we were coming
as soon as your office got involved
my office
youre sitting down there with scum like
wuertz and ramirez and youre talking
oh yeah gordon i almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat
dont try and cloud the fact that clearly
maronis got people in your office dent
we need lau back
but the chinese wont extradite
a national under any circumstances
if i get him to you
can you get him to talk
ill get him to sing
were going after the mobs life savings
things will get ugly
i knew the risk when i took this job
lieutenant
how will you get him back any
he does that
our chinese friends left town
before i could tell them the deal was off
well im sure that youve always
wanted to go to hong kong
whats wrong with a phone call
i think mr lau deserves
a more personal touch
now for highaltitude jumps
youre going to need oxygen
and stabilizers
well i must say
compared to your usual requests
jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward
what about getting back into the plane
id recommend a good travel agent
without it landing
now thats more like it mr wayne
the cia had a program
back in the 60s
for getting their people out
of hot spots called sky hook
we could look into that
yeah
okay now
hardened kevlar plates
over titaniumdipped
triweave fibers for flexibility
youll be lighter faster more agile
perhaps you should
read the instructions first
yeah
now there is a tradeoff
separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire
we wouldnt wanna make things
too easy now would we
how will it hold up against dogs
we talking rottweilers or chihuahuas
should do fine against cats
i found one in arizona
a very nice man said he could have it
up and running in a week
and hed take the cash
what about the flight crew
south korean smugglers
they run flights into pyongyang
below radar the whole way
did you think of an alibi
oh yes
i believe this is your plane sir
you look tired alfred
youll be all right without me
if you can tell me the russian for
apply your own bloody suntan lotion
yo gambol somebody here for you
they say theyve just killed the joker
they brought the body
so dead thats 500
how about alive hm
you wanna know how i got these scars
my father was
a drinker
and a fiend
and one night
he goes off crazier than usual
mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself
he doesnt like that
not one bit
so me watching
he takes the knife to her
laughing while he does it
he turns to me and he says
why so serious
he comes at me with the knife
why so serious
he sticks the blade in my mouth
lets put a smile on that face
and
why so serious
now
our operation is small
but there is a lot of potential
for aggressive expansion
so which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team
oh theres only one spot open
right now so were gonna have
tryouts
make it fast
welcome to hong kong mr fox
mr lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today
i understand
for security purposes im gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile
of course
i must apologize for leaving gotham
in the middle of our negotiations
this misunderstanding
with the gotham police force
i couldnt let such a thing threaten my company
of course
a businessman of your stature
will understand and
with you here now we can continue
well i do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style mr lau but i re
we do not allow cell phones in here
im sorry forgot i had it
no i really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold
you see we cant afford
to be seen to do business with
whatever it is youre accused of being
im sure a businessman of your stature
will understand
i think mr fox a simple phone call
might have sufficed
mr wayne didnt want you to think that
he was deliberately wasting your time
just accidentally wasting it
thats very good mr lau
accidentally very good
hey sir
theres a better view
from the peak tram
hows the view from lsi holdings
restricted
lau is holed up in there good and tight
whats this
i had rd work it up
sends out a highfrequency pulse
records the response time
for mapping an environment
sonar just like a
submarine mr wayne
like a submarine
and the other device
its in place
mr wayne
good luck
look give us the money
and well talk about making a deal
the money is the only reason
im still alive
oh you mean when they find out that
youve helped us theyre gonna kill you
are you threatening my client
no
im just assuming your clients
cooperation with this investigation
as will everyone
no okay
enjoy your time in county mr lau
wait
i wont give you the money
but i will give you my clients
all of them
you were a glorified accountant
what could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge
im good with calculation
i handled all their investments
one big part
got it
one minute
rico if they pooled their money
we can charge them all
as one criminal conspiracy
charge them with what
in a rico case if you can charge one
of the conspirators with a felony
you can charge all of them with it
thats great
mr lau
what kind of details do you have
about this communal fund
ledgers
immunity protection
a chartered plane back to hong kong
after you testify in open court
and im just curious
with all your clients locked up
whats gonna happen
with all that money
like i said im good with calculation
he cant go to county
ill keep him here in the holding cells
what is this gordon your fortress
well you trust them over at county
i dont trust them here
lau stays
well i dont know about
mr laus travel arrangements
but im sure glad hes back
put word out we hire the clown
he was right
we have to fix real problem
batman
im not aware of any participation by
the batman in these investigations
our boy looks good on the tube
you sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends lieutenant
oh dont worry theyre coming too
have a nice trip see you next fall
seven hundred twelve
counts of extortion
eight hundred and fortynine
counts of racketeering
two hundred and fortysix
counts of fraud
eightyseven counts
of conspiracy murder
five hundred and twentyseven
counts of obstruction of justice
how do the defendants plead
order in the court
five hundred and fortynine
criminals at once
how did you convince surrillo
to hear this farce
she shares my enthusiasm for justice
after all she is a judge
well even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of surrillo
youre gonna set a new record at appeals
for the quickest kick in the ass
it wont matter
the head guys make bail sure
but the midlevel guys they cant
they cant afford to be off the streets
long enough for trial and appeal
theyll cut deals that
include some jail time
think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets
mr mayor you cant
no get out both of you
sit down
the public likes you thats the
only reason that this might fly
but that means its on you
theyre all gonna come after you now
and not just the mob
politicians journalists cops
anyone whose wallets
about to get lighter
are you up to it youd better be
because they get anything on you
and those criminals are back on the
streets followed swiftly by you and me
jesus
i think your fundraiser
will be a great success sir
and why do you think i wanna
hold a party for harvey dent
i assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself
and the scum of gothams underbelly
to try to impress miss dawes
very droll but very wrong
actually its dent
police released video
footage found concealed on the body
sensitive viewers be aware
the image is disturbing
tell them your name
brian douglas
and are you the real batman
no
no
no
no
then why do you dress up like him
whoohoohoohoo
because hes a symbol that we
dont have to be afraid of scum like you
yeah you do brian you really do
huh yeah oh shh shh shh
so you think batmans
made gotham a better place hm
look at me
look at me
you see this is how crazy
batmans made gotham
you want order in gotham
batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in
oh and every day he doesnt
people will die
starting tonight
im a man of my word
harvey dent
scourge of the underworld
scared stiff by the trustfund brigade
ill be back
rachel
a little liquid courage mr dent
thank you alfred right
thats right sir
rachel talks about you all the time
youve known her her whole life
not yet sir
any psychotic exboyfriends
i should be aware of
oh you have no idea
im sorry that im late
im glad to see
that you all got started without me
now where is harvey where
harvey dent the man of the hour
wheres rachel dawes
she is my oldest friend come here
you know when rachel first told me
that she was dating harvey dent
i had one thing to say
the guy from those godawful
campaign commercials
i believe in harvey dent
yeah nice slogan harvey
but it caught rachels attention
and then i started to pay attention
to harvey
and all that hes been doing
as our new da
and you know what
i believe in harvey dent
i believe that on his watch
gotham can feel
a little safer a little more optimistic
look at this face this is the face
of gothams bright future
to harvey dent lets hear it for him
harvey
harvey may not know you
well enough
to understand when youre
making fun of him
but i do
no i meant every word
you know that day
that you once told me about
when gotham would no longer
need batman
its coming
bruce
you cant ask me to wait for that
its happening now harvey is that hero
he locked up half of the citys criminals
and he did it without wearing a mask
gotham needs a hero with a face
you can throw a party wayne
ill give you that
thanks again
you mind if i borrow rachel
lieutenant that joker card
pinned to the body
forensics found three sets of dna
any matches
all three
the dna belongs to judge surrillo

an awful lot of information
even we dont know
where youre going
take the envelope get in open it
itll tell you where youre headed
you can not leave me alone
with these people
the whole mobs after you
and youre worried about these guys
yeah compared to this
the mob doesnt scare me
gordon youre unlikely to discover this
for yourself so
take my word the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats
i found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago
them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly
yeah i bet
yeah it makes you think about things
you couldnt stand losing
about who you wanna spend the
rest of your life with
thats a pretty big commitment
well not if the mob has their way
you get to explain to my wife
why im late for dinner lieutenant
sir the joker card
had traces of your dna on it
dont do that
all right
lets be serious then
okay
whats your answer
i dont have an answer

you remind me of my father
i hated my father
okay stop
well hello beautiful
you must be harveys squeeze hm
and you are beautiful
you look nervous is it the scars
you wanna know how i got them
come here hey
look at me
so i had a wife
she was beautiful like you
who tells me i worry too much
who tells me i ought to smile more
who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks hey
one day they carve her face
and we have no money for surgeries
she cant take it
i just wanna see her smile again hm
i just want her to know
that i dont care about the scars
so
i stick a razor in my mouth
and do this
to myself
and you know what
she cant stand the sight of me
she leaves
now i see the funny side
now im always smiling
got a little fight in you i like that
then youre gonna love me
drop the gun
oh sure you just take off
your little mask
and show us all who
you really are hm
let her go
very poor choice of words
are you all right
lets not do that again
is harvey okay
hes safe
thank you
jim its over
as long as they dont get to lau
weve cut off their funds
the prosecutions over
nobodys standing up
in front of a judge
while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away
what about dent
hes got any sense
dents halfway to mex
so where do you keep your trash
youre due in court i need you alive
long enough to get you on the record
you cant protect me
you cant even protect yourselves
you refuse to cooperate youre not
coming back here you go to county
how long do you calculate
youll last in there
targeting me wont get their money back
i knew the mob wouldnt go
down without a fight
but this is different
they crossed a line
you crossed the line first sir
you squeezed them you hammered them
to the point of desperation
and in their desperation they turned to
a man they didnt fully understand
criminals arent complicated alfred
we just need to figure out
what hes after
with respect master wayne
perhaps this is a man
you dont fully understand either
a long time ago i was in burma
and my friends and i were working
for the local government
they were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders
by bribing them with
precious stones
but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of rangoon by a bandit
so we went looking for the stones
but in six months we never
met anyone who traded with him
one day i saw a child
playing with a ruby
the size of a tangerine
the bandit had been
throwing them away
so why steal them
well because he thought it was good sport
because some men arent looking
for anything logical like money
they cant be bought bullied
reasoned or negotiated with
some men just wanna
watch the world burn

before your men contaminate it
us contaminate it
its because of you these guys are dead
hey detective
give us a minute guys
thats brick underneath

off a shattered bullet

fingerprints
whatever youre gonna do do it fast
because we found his next target
hes put it in tomorrows paper
im not sure
you made it loud enough sir
what can i do for you mr reese
you wanted me to do the diligence
on the lsi holdings deal again
well i found some irregularities
their ceo is in police custody
no not with their numbers with yours
applied sciences whole division
of wayne enterprises
just disappeared overnight
i went down to the archives
and i started pulling some old files
dont tell me you didnt
recognize your baby out there
pancaking cop cars
on the evening news
now you got the entire rd
department burning through cash
claiming its related to
cell phones for the army
what are you building for him now
a rocket ship
i want
10 million dollars a year
for the rest of my life
let me get this straight
you think that your client
one of the wealthiest
most powerful men in the world
is secretly a vigilante
who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare hands
and your plan
is to blackmail this person
good luck
well
keep that
this is your original scan
here it is reengineered
and theres the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip
ill get you a copy
mr wayne did you reassign rd
yeah government
telecommunications project
i wasnt aware
we had any government contracts
lucius im playing this one
pretty close to the chest
fair enough
with no word from the batman
even as they mourn
commissioner loeb
these cops have to be wondering if
the joker will make good on his threat
in the obituary column of
the gotham times to kill the mayor
ive checked all the databases
there are four possibles
crossreference the addresses
look for parkside
overlooking the parade
i got one
melvin white
1502 randolph apartments
aggravated assault
moved to arkham twice
what do you got on the roof
were tight but frankly
theres a lot of windows up here
commissioner loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement
and to the protection
of his community
i remember when i first took office
and i asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner
and he said he would provided
i kept my politics out of his office
clearly he was not a man who minced
words nor should he have been
a number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular
policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters
whos that
what happened
they took our guns
and our uniforms
and as we recognize
the sacrifice of this man
we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety
stand by honor guard
attention port arms
ready aim fire
ready aim
ready aim
stay down dont move
mr mayor get him out of here
ill see you later
why are you going back
get out of here
tell me what you know about the joker
no
im sorry barbara

harvey trust me
bruces penthouse is now
the safest place in the city
then you go straight there
you dont tell anybody where you
are going and ill find you there
i love you
i want the joker
from one professional to another
if youre trying to scare somebody
pick a better spot
from this height
the fall wouldnt kill me
im counting on it
huh
where is he
i dont know where he is he found us
he must have friends
friends have you met this guy
someone knows where he is
nobodys gonna tell you nothing
theyre wise to your act
you got rules
the joker hes got no rules
nobodys gonna cross him for you
if you want this guy you got one way
but you already know what that is
just take off that mask
let him come find you
or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind
you wanna play games
hows that feel
you wouldnt
i wouldnt
you dont think i will
mmmm
you dont think i will
mmmm
no no i wouldnt
thats why im not
gonna leave it up to me
heads you get to keep your head
tails
not so lucky
so you wanna tell me about the joker
lets go again
i dont know anything i dont
youre not playing the odds friend
lets do it again
youd leave a mans life to chance
not exactly
his names schiff thomas
hes a paranoid schizophrenic
former patient at arkham
the kind of mind the joker attracts
what do you expect to learn from him
the joker killed gordon
hes gonna kill rachel
youre the symbol of hope
i could never be
your stand against organized crime
is the first legitimate ray of light
in gotham in decades
if anyone saw this
everything would be undone
all the criminals you pulled off the
streets would be released
and jim gordon
will have died for nothing
youre gonna hold a press
conference tomorrow morning
why
no one else will die because of me
gothams in your hands now
you cant
you cant give in
you cant give in
harvey called
he said batmans gonna turn himself in
i have no choice
you honestly think thats gonna
keep the joker from killing people
maybe not but i have enough
blood on my hands
and ive seen now what i would
have to become to stop men like him
you once told me that
if the day came when i was finished
that wed be together
bruce dont make me
your one hope for a normal life
did you mean it
yes
bruce
if you turn yourself in
theyre not gonna let us be together
logs as well
everything
anything that could lead back
to lucius or rachel
people are dying alfred
what would you have me do
endure master wayne take it
theyll hate you for it
but thats the point of batman
he can be the outcast he can make
the choice that no one else can make
the right choice
no today i found out
what batman cant do
he cant endure this
today you get to say i told you so
today i dont want to
but i did bloody tell you
i suppose theyre gonna
lock me up as well
as your accomplice
accomplice im gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea
ladies and gentlemen thank you for coming
ive called this press conference for two reasons
firstly to assure the citizens
of gotham
that everything that can be done
over the joker killings is being done
secondly because the batman
has offered to turn himself in
but first lets consider the situation
should we give in
to this terrorists demands
do we really think hes gonna
youd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens
the batman is an outlaw
but thats not why we
demand he turn himself in
were doing it because were scared
weve been happy to let the batman
clean up our streets for us until now
things are worse than ever
amen
yes they are
but the night is darkest
just before the dawn
and i promise you
the dawn is coming
one day the batman will have to answer
for the laws hes broken but to us
not to this madman
no more dead cops
yeah
he should turn himself in
give us the batman come on
where is he
so be it take the batman into custody
what
is he here
i am the batman
what
come on
alfred
why is he letting harvey do this
he went down to the press conference
i know he just stood by
perhaps both bruce and mr dent
believe that batman stands for
something more important
than the whims of a terrorist
miss dawes
even if everyone hates him for it
thats the sacrifice hes making
hes not being a hero
hes being something more
yeah youre absolutely right
letting harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all
you know him better than anyone
i do
will you give this to him for me
when the time is right
how will i know
its not sealed
goodbye alfred
bye rachel
sorry i didnt have time to talk
this through with you
what are you doing
theyre transferring me
to central holding
this is the jokers chance and when he
attacks the batman will take him down
listen to me this is too dangerous
we get this guy to county
hes their problem
streets will be
cleared along your route
so lets go
convoy stops for no reason
i hope you got some moves pal
hes using you as bait he doesnt
even know if he can get the joker
hes failed so far
how do you know
what hes thinking
i just i do anyway harvey
this isnt just about you
what about all of the people
who are depending on you
to clean the city up
and do it honorably and
harvey tell everyone the truth
heads i go through with it
this is your life you cant leave
something like that to chance
im not
you make your own luck
hey you wait like everybody else pal
what the hell is that
obstruction ahead obstruction ahead

hm your people

a hungry dog really is
its not about money
its about sending a message

i had a vision
of a world without batman
the mob ground out a little profit
and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time
and it was so boring
ive had a change of heart
i dont want mr reese
spoiling everything
but why should i have all the fun
lets give someone else a chance
if coleman reese
isnt dead in 60 minutes
then i blow up a hospital
i want you to call in every officer

commissioner
you okay son
hi
you know
i dont want there to be
any hard feelings between us harvey
when you and
rachel
rachel were being abducted
i was sitting in gordons cage
i didnt rig those charges
your men your plan
do i really look like a guy with a plan
you know what i am
im a dog chasing cars
i wouldnt know what to do with one
if i caught it
you know i just do things
the mob has plans the cops have plans
gordons got plans
you know theyre schemers
schemers trying to control
their little worlds
im not a schemer
i try to show the schemers
how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are
so when i say ah come here
when i say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal
you know that im telling the truth
im gonna need your weapon
what
why because my wifes in the hospital
yeah that would be why
its the schemers
that put you where you are
you were a schemer you had plans
and look where that got you
the police of course
are taking every possible precaution
and urging everyone not to
take matters into their hands
i just did what i do best
i took your little plan
i turned it on itself
look what i did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a couple of bullets
hm you know
you know what i noticed
nobody panics when
things go according to plan
even if the plan is horrifying
if tomorrow i tell the press that like
a gangbanger will get shot
or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up
nobody panics
because its all part of the plan
but when i say that
one little old mayor will die
well then everyone loses their minds
introduce a little anarchy
upset the established order
and everything becomes chaos
im an agent of chaos
oh and you know the thing
about chaos
its fair
you live
mmhm
you die
mmm now were talking
mr reese
thats mr wayne isnt it
that was a very brave thing you did
trying to catch the light
you werent protecting the van
why whos in it
dont you think
i should go to the hospital
you dont watch a whole lot of news
do you mr wayne
southeast
its gotham general
did you clear the building
yeah
we must know
how many were inside
you have patient lists roll call
right now were showing
50 people missing one bus

and anyone left here plays by my rules
rules
mr fox security is showing
a breakin at the rd department
if you dont wanna be in the game

i gotta take a leak
keep an eye out for me will you
now what
you need someone to shake it for you

that youre gonna protect
the other traitor in gordons unit
i dont know he never told me
listen dent i swear to god i didnt
know what they were gonna do to you
thats funny
because i dont know
whats gonna happen to you either
beautiful isnt it
beautiful
unethical
dangerous
youve turned every cell phone
in gotham into a microphone
and a highfrequency generatorreceiver
you took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city
with half the city feeding you sonar
you can image all of gotham
this is wrong
ive gotta find this man lucius
at what cost
the database is nullkey encrypted
it can only be accessed by one person
this is too much power for one person
thats why i gave it to you
only you can use it
spying on 30 million people
isnt part of my job description
this is an audio sample if he talks
within range of any phone in the city
you can triangulate his position
ill help you this one time
but consider this my resignation
as long as this machine is
at wayne enterprises i wont be
when youre finished
type in your name
well my officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges
but with the jokers threat
theyre not an option
and land routes east
backed up for hours
which leaves the ferries
with 30000 ready to board
plus i wanna use the ferries so i can
get some of those prisoners off the island
the men you and dent put away
those arent people im worried about
you should be
whatever the jokers planning
its a good bet harveys prisoners might be involved
i wanna get them out of here
so where is harvey
we havent found him
oh jesus
how long can you keep this quiet
dont stop for lights cops nothing
going to join your wife
you love her
yes
you ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die
look take it up with the joker
he killed your woman he made you
like this
the jokers just a mad dog
i want whoever let him off the leash
i took care of wuertz but who is
your other man inside gordons unit
who picked up rachel
must have been someone she trusted
look if i tell you

captain we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow and this
oh my god
looks like some kind of detonator
why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb
tonight youre all gonna be
a part of a social experiment
through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate
im ready right now
to blow you all skyhigh
liberty come in over

if anyone attempts
to get off their boat you all die
im zeroing in
each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat

but its not the source
west

prewitt building
assemble on the building opposite
at midnight i blow you all up
if however one of you presses
the button ill let that boat live
so whos it gonna be
harvey dents mostwanted
scumbag collection
or the sweet and innocent civilians
you choose
oh and you might wanna
decide quickly
because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble
stay back
well now who are you to decide
we ought to talk this over at least
we dont all have to die
those men had their chance
we are not going to talk about this
why arent we talking about it
theyre talking over the same exact
thing on the other boat
lets put it to a vote
yes
hello
barbara its anna ramirez
jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away
but the units outside
those cops cant be trusted
jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible
ill call them off for 10 minutes
and youll have to move fast
but where am i supposed to take them
250 52nd street
leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out
okay
she believe you
its because she trusts you
just like rachel did
i didnt know

what exactly did you think
they were gonna do
they got me early on
my mothers hospital bills
dont
im sorry
you live to fight another day officer
we found the missing hospital bus
and we have a hostage situation
its a shooting gallery
why would he choose a spot
with such big windows
we have clear shots on five clowns
snipers take them out
smash the windows a team rappels in
team moves in by the stairwells
two three casualties max
lets do it
its not that simple
with the joker it never is
whats simple is that
every second we dont take in
those people on the ferries get closer
to blowing each other up
that wont happen
then hell blow both of them up
we dont have time for paper ballots
i want everybody to put their votes
on this piece of paper
if anyones got pens pass it along
thank you anybody else coming

these men will kill you
and take it anyway
no one wants to get their hands dirty

those men on that boat

it doesnt make any sense
for us to have to die too
all the old familiar places
stand by
red team floor secure
hostages are safe
give it to me
you can tell them i took it by force
give it to me and ill do what
you shouldve did 10 minutes ago
we really should stop this fighting
otherwise well miss the fireworks
there wont be any fireworks
and here we go
what were you trying to prove
that deep down
everyones as ugly as you
youre alone
cant rely on anyone these days you
gotta do everything yourself dont we
thats okay i came prepared
its a funny world we live in speaking of
which you know how i got these scars
no but i know how you got these
oh you
you just couldnt let me go could you
this is what happens
when an unstoppable force
meets an immovable object
you truly are incorruptible arent you
huh you wont kill me
out of some misplaced sense
of selfrighteousness
and i wont kill you
because youre just too much fun
i think you and i are destined
to do this forever
youll be in a padded cell forever
maybe we could share one
you know
theyll be doubling up
the rate this citys inhabitants
are losing their minds
this city just showed you
that its full of people
ready to believe in good
until their spirit breaks completely
until they get a good look
at the real harvey dent
and all the heroic things hes done
you didnt think id risk losing the battle
for gothams soul
in a fistfight with you
no
you need an ace in the hole
mines harvey
what did you do
i took gothams white knight
and i brought him down to our level
it wasnt hard
see madness as you know
is like gravity
all it takes is a little push
dent
this is where they brought her
gordon after your men handed her over
this is where she died
i know i was here
trying to save her
but you didnt
i couldnt
yes you couldve
if youd listened to me
if you stood up against corruption
instead of doing your deal
with the devil
i was trying to fight the mob
you wouldnt dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what id lost
have you ever had to talk to the
person you loved most
tell them its gonna be all right
when you know its not
well youre about to know
what that feels like gordon
then you can look me in the eye
and tell me youre sorry
youre not going to hurt my family
no
just the person you love most
so is it your wife
put the gun down harvey
harvey put down the gun
please please harvey please
oh goddamn it
will you stop pointing that gun
at my family
no
we have a winner
no jim stop him
harvey
dont let him
harvey
im sorry
for everything
please dont hurt my son
you brought your cops
all they know is theres a situation
they dont know who or what
theyre just creating a perimeter
you think i wanna escape from this
there is no escape from this
you dont wanna hurt the boy harvey
its not about what i want
its about whats fair
you thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time
but you were wrong
the world is cruel and the only morality
in a cruel world
is chance
unbiased
unprejudiced
fair
his sons got the same chance she had
fiftyfifty
what happened to rachel wasnt
chance we decided to act
we three
then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything
it wasnt
the joker chose me
because you were the best of us
he wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you
could fall
and he was right
youre the one pointing the gun harvey
so point it at the people responsible
fair enough
you first
my turn
harvey youre right
rachels death was my fault
please dont punish the boy
please punish me
im about to
tell your boy
hes gonna be all right gordon
lie
like i lied
its going to be all right son
no
dad daddy is he okay
thank you
you dont have to thank me
yes i do
the joker won
harveys prosecution
everything he fought for
undone
whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with harveys reputation
we bet it all on him
the joker took the best of us
and tore him down
people will lose hope
they wont
they must never know what he did
five dead
two of them cops
you cant sweep that
no
but the joker cannot win
gotham needs its true hero
no
you either die a hero
or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain
i can do those things
because im not a hero not like dent
i killed those people
thats what i can be
no no you cant youre not
im whatever gotham needs me to be
call it in
a hero
not the hero we deserved
but the hero we needed
nothing less than a knight
shining
theyll hunt you
youll hunt me
youll condemn me
set the dogs on me
because thats what needs to happen
because sometimes
the truth isnt good enough
sometimes people deserve more
sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded
batman
batman
whys he running dad
because we have to chase him
okay were going in go go move
he didnt do anything wrong
because hes the hero gotham deserves
but not the one it needs right now
so well hunt him
because he can take it
because hes not our hero
