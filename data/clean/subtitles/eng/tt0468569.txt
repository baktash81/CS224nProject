a share  five shares is plenty 
six shares  don t forget
the guy who planned the job 
he thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice 
 i know why they call him the joker 
so  why do they call him the joker 
i heard he wears makeup 
makeup 
yeah  to scare people 
you know  war paint 
all right  everybody 
hands up  heads down 
i said  hands up  heads down 
let s go  pal 
i m making a withdrawal here 
 i said  hands up

here comes the silent alarm 
and there it goes 
heads down 
all right  tootsie

i guess the joker s as crazy as they say 
where s the alarm guy 
boss told me when the guy
was done  i should take him out 
one less share  right 
funny  he told me something similar 
he what  no  no 
that s a lot of money 
if this joker guy was so smart 
he d have us bring a bigger car 
i m betting the joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash 
no  no  no  no  i kill the bus driver 
bus driver 
what bus driver 
school s out  time to go 
cat s not getting up  is he

oh  criminals in this town
used to believe in things 
honor

look at you 
what do you believe in  huh

the criminals are running scared  but i say   
 no  man  i don t like it tonight

the power bowl than running into him 
that simply is not true 
i m told that our men in the
major crimes unit are close to an arrest

another bunch of small timers 
some of the marked bills i gave you 
my detectives have been
making drug buys with them for weeks 
this bank was another drop for the mob 
that makes five 
 we found the bulk of their dirty cash 
 time to move in 
we d have to hit all banks
simultaneously  swat teams  backup 
what about this joker guy 
one man or the entire mob  he can wait 
when the new da hears about this 
he ll want in 
 do you trust him 
 be hard to keep him out 
i hear he s as stubborn as you are 
be nice when wayne manor s rebuilt 
you can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse   
   for not sleeping in a mansion 
whenever you stitch yourself up 
you do make a bloody mess 
yeah  it makes me learn
from my mistakes 
you ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now  then 
my armor 
i m carrying too much weight 
i need to be   i need to be faster 
i m sure mr  fox can oblige 
 did you get mauled by a tiger 
 it was a dog 
 huh

there were more copycats last night 
alfred  with guns 
why don t you hire them and
take the weekend off 
that wasn t exactly
what i had in mind   
   when i said i wanted
to inspire people 
i know 
but things have improved 
look at the new district attorney 
i am  closely 
need to know if he can be trusted 
are you interested in his character
or his social circle 
who rachel spends her time with
is her business 
i trust you don t have me followed
on my day off 
if you ever took one  i might 
know your limits  master wayne 
batman has no limits 
 well  you do  sir 
 well  can t afford to know them 
and what s gonna happen
on the day that you find out 
we all know how much you like to say
 i told you so  
on that day  master wayne 
even i won t want to 
probably 
sorry i m late  folks 
 where were you 
 worried you d have to step up 
 harvey  i know these briefs backwards 
 well  then   
   fair s fair 
heads  i ll take it  tails  he s all yours

i wouldn t leave something like that
up to chance 
i don t  i make my own luck 
all rise 
the honorable judge freel presiding 
i thought the da just played golf
with the mayor or things like that 
tee off s 1 30  more than enough time
to put you away for life  sally 
with carmine falcone in arkham   
   someone must have stepped up
to run the so called family 
is that man in this courtroom today 
 could you identify him for us  please 
 you win  counselor 
it was me 
i have a sworn statement from you
that this man   
   salvatore maroni  is the new head
of the falcone crime family 
maroni  he s a fall guy 
i m the brains of the organization 
order 
 permission to treat   
    the witness as hostile 
 granted 
 hostile  i ll show you hostile 
carbon fiber   28 caliber 
made in china 
if you wanna kill a
public servant  mr  maroni   
   i recommend you buy american 
get him out of here 
 but  your honor  i m not done 
we ll never be able to link the gun to maroni 
so we won t be able to charge him 
but the fact that they re trying to kill you 
means we re getting to them 
i m glad you re so pleased  rachel 
i m fine  by the way 
come on  harvey  you re gotham s da 
you re not getting shot at 
you re not doing your job right 
but  you know   
   if you said you were rattled 
we could take the rest of the day off 
can t  i dragged the head of
the major crimes unit down here 
oh  jim gordon  he s a friend  actually 
try to be nice 
i hear you got a hell of a right cross 
it s a shame sal s going to walk 
yeah  well  good thing about the mob
is they keep giving you second chances 
lightly irradiated bills 
fancy stuff for a city cop  have help 
we liaise with various agencies  
save it  gordon  i wanna meet him 
official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as batman on sight 
mm hm  what about that floodlight
on the top of mcu 
if you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment   
   i suggest you take them up
with maintenance  counselor 
i ve put every money launderer
in gotham behind bars   
   but the mob
is still getting its money out 
i think you and your friend
have found the last game in town 
you re trying to hit them
where it hurts  their wallets 
it s bold 
you gonna count me in 
in this town  the fewer people know
something  the safer the operation 
gordon  i don t like that you got
your own special unit   
   and i don t like that it s full of cops
i investigated at internal affairs 
if i didn t work with cops you d investigated
while you were making your name at ia   
   i d be working alone 
i don t get political points
for being an idealist 
i have to do the best i can with what i have 
you want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks   
   without telling me what we re after 
i can give you the names of the banks 
well  that s a start 
i ll get you your warrants 
but i want your trust 
oh  you don t have
to sell me  dent 
we all know you re gotham s
white knight 
yeah  well  i heard they have
a different name for me down at mcu 
i wouldn t know about that 
in china  lau security investments
stands for dynamic new growth 
a joint chinese venture with
wayne enterprises will be a powerhouse 
well  mr  lau   
   i speak for the rest of the board   
   and mr  wayne 
in expressing our own excitement 
sir  i know that mr  wayne is curious
about how his trust fund gets replenished   
   but  frankly  this is embarrassing 
you worry about the diligence 
mr  reese 
i ll worry about bruce wayne 
it s done 
the numbers are solid 
do them again 
wouldn t want the trust fund to run out 
now  would we 
another long night 
this joint venture was your idea 
and the consultants love it 
but i m not convinced 
lau s company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork 
his revenue stream
must be off the books   
   maybe even illegal 
okay  cancel the deal 
you already knew 
just needed a closer look at their books 
anything else you can trouble me for 
i need a new suit 
yeah  three buttons
is a little  90s  mr  wayne 
i m not talking fashion  mr  fox 
so much as function 
you wanna be able to turn your head 
sure make backing out
of the driveway easier 
i ll see what i can do 
took me three weeks
to get a reservation here 
and i had to tell them
i work for the government 
 really 
 the city health inspector s   
   not afraid to pull strings 
rachel  fancy that 
yeah  bruce  fancy that 
rachel  natascha  natascha  rachel 
 natascha  are you the prima   
 prima ballerina for the moscow ballet 
 wow  harvey s taking me next week 
 really  so you re into ballet 
bruce  this is harvey dent 
the famous bruce wayne 
rachel s told me everything about you 
i certainly hope not 
 so  let s put a couple of tables together 
 i m not sure that they ll let us 
oh  they should  i own the place 
how could you want to raise children
in a city like this 
well  i was raised here 
i turned out okay 
is wayne manor in the city limits 
is    heh heh 
the palisades  sure 
you know  as our new da 
you might wanna figure out   
   where your jurisdiction ends 
i m talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante 
gotham city is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what s right 
gotham needs heroes like you 
elected officials   
   not a man who thinks
he s above the law 
exactly  who appointed the batman 
we did  all of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city 
but this is a democracy  harvey 
when their enemies were at the gates   
   the romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city 
it wasn t considered an honor 
it was considered a public service 
harvey  the last man
that they appointed   
   to protect the republic
was named caesar   
    and he never gave up his power 
 okay  fine 
you either die a hero   
   or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain 
look  whoever the batman is  he doesn t
wanna do this for the rest of his life 
how could he  batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle 
someone like you  mr  dent 
maybe  if i m up to it 
what if harvey dent
is the caped crusader  hm 
if i were sneaking out every night 
someone would ve noticed by now 
well  i m sold  dent 
and i m gonna throw you a fundraiser 
that s nice of you bruce  but i m not
up for re election for three years 
no  you don t understand 
one fundraiser with my pals   
   you ll never need another cent 
what the hell is this 
as you re all aware 
one of our deposits was stolen 
a relatively small amount  68 million 
who s stupid enough to steal from us 
two bit wackjob 
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup 
he s not the problem  he s a nobody 
the problem is our money
being tracked by the cops 
thanks to mr  maroni s
well placed sources   
   we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills   
   and are planning to
seize your funds today 
and since the enthusiastic new da has
put all my competitors out of business   
    i m your only option 
so  what are you proposing 
moving all deposits to
one secure location  not a bank 
 where  then 
 no one can know but me 
if the police were to gain leverage
over one of you   
   everyone s money would be at stake 
what stop them getting to you 
i go to hong kong 
far from dent s jurisdiction   
   and the chinese will not extradite
one of their own 
how soon can you move the money 
i already have 
for obvious reasons  i couldn t wait
for your permission 
rest assured  your money is safe 
oh  hee hee  aha 
ha  ooh  hee  ha  ha ha 
and i thought my jokes were bad 
give me one reason why i shouldn t
have my boy here pull your head off 
how about a magic trick 
i m gonna make this pencil disappear 
ta da 
it s  
it s gone 
oh  and by the way 
the suit  it wasn t cheap 
 you ought to know  you bought it 
sit 
i want to hear proposition 
let s wind the clocks back a year 
these cops and lawyers
wouldn t dare cross any of you 
i mean  what happened 
did your balls drop off  hm 
you see  a guy like me    
 a freak 
damn right 
a guy like me   look  listen 
i know why you choose
to have your little  ahem   
   group therapy sessions
in broad daylight 
i know why you re afraid
to go out at night 
the batman 
see  batman has shown gotham
your true colors  unfortunately 
dent  he s just the beginning 
and as for the television s
so called plan   
   batman has no jurisdiction 
he ll find him and make him squeal 
i know the squealers when i see them   
   and    
what do you propose 
it s simple  we  uh  kill the batman 
if it s so simple  why haven t
you done it already 
if you re good at something 
never do it for free 
how much you want 
uh  half 
you re crazy 
 no  i m not 
no  i m not 
if we don t deal with this now   
   soon   
   little gambol here won t be able
to get a nickel for his grandma 
enough from the clown 
ah  ta ta ta  let s not blow   
shit 
    this out of proportion 
you think you can steal from us
and just walk away 
 yeah 
i m putting the word out 
five hundred grand for this clown dead 
a million alive  so i can teach him
some manners first 
all right  so  listen 
why don t you give me a call   
   when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously 
here s my card 
mm mm 
you re a hard man to reach 
lau s halfway to hong kong 
if you d have asked  i could have taken his passport 
i told you to keep me in the loop 
all that was left in the vaults
were marked bills 
they knew we were coming 
as soon as your office got involved  
my office 
you re sitting down there with scum like
wuertz and ramirez and you re talking  
oh  yeah gordon  i almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat 
don t try and cloud the fact that clearly
maroni s got people in your office  dent 
we need lau back   
   but the chinese won t extradite
a national under any circumstances 
if i get him to you 
can you get him to talk 
i ll get him to sing 
we re going after the mob s life savings 
things will get ugly 
i knew the risk when i took this job 
lieutenant 
how will you get him back  any   
he does that 
our chinese friends left town
before i could tell them the deal was off 
well  i m sure that you ve always
wanted to go to hong kong 
what s wrong with a phone call 
i think mr  lau deserves
a more personal touch 
now  for high altitude jumps   
   you re going to need oxygen
and stabilizers 
well  i must say 
compared to your usual requests   
   jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward 
what about getting back into the plane 
 i d recommend a good travel agent 
 without it landing 
now  that s more like it  mr  wayne 
the cia had a program
back in the  60s   
   for getting their people out
of hot spots called sky hook 
 we could look into that 
 yeah 
okay  now    
hardened kevlar plates
over titanium dipped   
   tri weave fibers for flexibility 
you ll be lighter  faster  more agile 
perhaps you should
read the instructions first 
 yeah 
 now  there is a tradeoff 
separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire 
we wouldn t wanna make things
too easy  now  would we 
how will it hold up against dogs 
we talking rottweilers or chihuahuas 
should do fine against cats 
i found one in arizona 
a very nice man said he could have it
up and running in a week   
   and he d take the cash 
 what about the flight crew 
 south korean smugglers 
they run flights into pyongyang 
below radar the whole way 
 did you think of an alibi 
 oh  yes 
i believe this is your plane  sir 
you look tired  alfred 
you ll be all right without me 
if you can tell me the russian for
 apply your own bloody suntan lotion  
yo  gambol  somebody here for you 
they say they ve just killed the joker 
they brought the body 
so  dead  that s 500 
how about alive  hm 
you wanna know how i got these scars 
my father was   
   a drinker   
   and a fiend 
and one night 
he goes off crazier than usual 
mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself 
he doesn t like that   
   not one bit 
so  me watching   
   he takes the knife to her 
laughing while he does it 
he turns to me and he says 
 why so serious  
he comes at me with the knife 
 why so serious  
he sticks the blade in my mouth 
 let s put a smile on that face  
and    
why so serious 
now   
   our operation is small   
   but there is a lot of potential   
   for aggressive expansion 
so which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team 
oh  there s only one spot open
right now  so we re gonna have   
   tryouts 
make it fast 
welcome to hong kong  mr  fox 
mr  lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today 
i understand 
for security purposes  i m gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile 
of course 
i must apologize for leaving gotham
in the middle of our negotiations 
this misunderstanding
with the gotham police force   
    i couldn t let such a thing threaten my company 
 of course 
a businessman of your stature
will understand and   
   with you here now  we can continue 
well  i do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style  mr  lau  but i re  
we do not allow cell phones in here 
i m sorry  forgot i had it 
no  i really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold 
you see  we can t afford
to be seen to do business with   
   whatever it is you re accused of being 
i m sure a businessman of your stature
will understand 
i think  mr  fox  a simple phone call
might have sufficed 
mr  wayne didn t want you to think that
he was deliberately wasting your time 
just accidentally wasting it 
that s very good  mr  lau 
 accidentally   very good 
hey  sir 
there s a better view
from the peak tram 
how s the view from lsi holdings 
restricted 
lau is holed up in there good and tight 
 what s this 
 i had r d work it up 
sends out a high frequency pulse   
   records the response time
for mapping an environment 
sonar  just like a    
submarine  mr  wayne 
like a submarine 
 and the other device 
 it s in place 
mr  wayne 
good luck 
look  give us the money
and we ll talk about making a deal 
the money is the only reason
i m still alive 
oh  you mean  when they find out that
you ve helped us  they re gonna kill you 
 are you threatening my client 
 no 
i m just assuming your client s
cooperation with this investigation 
as will everyone 
no  okay 
enjoy your time in county  mr  lau 
wait 
i won t give you the money   
   but i will give you my clients 
all of them 
you were a glorified accountant 
what could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge 
i m good with calculation 
i handled all their investments 
one big part 
got it 
one minute 
rico  if they pooled their money   
   we can charge them all
as one criminal conspiracy 
charge them with what 
in a rico case  if you can charge one
of the conspirators with a felony  
you can charge all of them with it 
that s great 
mr  lau 
what kind of details do you have
about this communal fund 
 ledgers   
 immunity  protection   
    a chartered plane back to hong kong 
 after you testify in open court 
and i m just curious 
with all your clients locked up   
   what s gonna happen
with all that money 
like i said  i m good with calculation 
he can t go to county 
i ll keep him here in the holding cells 
what is this  gordon  your fortress 
well  you trust them over at county 
i don t trust them here 
lau stays 
well  i don t know about
mr  lau s travel arrangements   
   but i m sure glad he s back 
put word out  we hire the clown 
he was right 
we have to fix real problem 
batman 
 i m not aware of any participation by
the batman in these investigations    
our boy looks good on the tube 
you sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends  lieutenant 
oh  don t worry  they re coming too 
have a nice trip  see you next fall 
seven hundred twelve
counts of extortion 
eight hundred and forty nine
counts of racketeering 
two hundred and forty six
counts of fraud 
eighty seven counts
of conspiracy murder 
five hundred and twenty seven
counts of obstruction of justice 
how do the defendants plead 
order in the court 
five hundred and forty nine
criminals at once 
how did you convince surrillo
to hear this farce 
she shares my enthusiasm for justice 
after all  she is a judge 
well  even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of surrillo   
   you re gonna set a new record at appeals
for the quickest kick in the ass 
it won t matter 
the head guys make bail  sure 
but the mid level guys  they can t 
they can t afford to be off the streets
long enough for trial and appeal 
they ll cut deals that
include some jail time 
think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets 
mr  mayor  you can t  
 no  get out  both of you 
sit down 
the public likes you  that s the
only reason that this might fly 
but that means it s on you 
they re all gonna come after you now 
and not just the mob 
politicians  journalists  cops 
anyone whose wallet s
about to get lighter 
are you up to it  you d better be 
because they get anything on you   
   and those criminals are back on the
streets  followed swiftly by you and me 
jesus 
i think your fundraiser
will be a great success  sir 
and why do you think i wanna
hold a party for harvey dent 
i assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself   
   and the scum of gotham s underbelly 
to try to impress miss dawes 
very droll  but very wrong 
actually  it s dent 
police released video
footage found concealed on the body 
sensitive viewers  be aware 
the image is disturbing 
tell them your name 
brian douglas 
and are you the real batman 
no 
no 
 no 
 no 
then why do you dress up like him 
whoo hoo hoo hoo 
because he s a symbol that we
don t have to be afraid of scum like you 
yeah  you do  brian  you really do 
huh  yeah  oh  shh  shh  shh 
so you think batman s
made gotham a better place  hm 
look at me

and turn himself in 
oh  and every day he doesn t 
people will die 
starting tonight 
i m a man of my word

scourge of the underworld   
   scared stiff by the trust fund brigade 
 i ll be back

harvey dent  the man of the hour 
where s rachel dawes

that she was dating harvey dent   
   i had one thing to say 
the guy from those god awful
campaign commercials 
 i believe in harvey dent  
yeah  nice slogan  harvey 
but it caught rachel s attention 
and then i started to pay attention
to harvey   
   and all that he s been doing
as our new da 
and you know what 
i believe in harvey dent 
i believe that on his watch 
gotham can feel   
   a little safer  a little more optimistic 
look at this face  this is the face
of gotham s bright future 
to harvey dent  let s hear it for him 
harvey 
harvey may not know you
well enough   
   to understand when you re
making fun of him   
    but i do 
 no  i meant every word 
you know that day
that you once told me about   
   when gotham would no longer
need batman 
 it s coming 
 bruce 
 you can t ask me to wait for that 
 it s happening now  harvey is that hero 
he locked up half of the city s criminals 
and he did it without wearing a mask 
gotham needs a hero with a face 
you can throw a party  wayne 
i ll give you that 
thanks again 
you mind if i borrow rachel 
lieutenant  that joker card
pinned to the body 
forensics found three sets of dna 
 any matches 
 all three 
the dna belongs to judge surrillo 
harvey dent and commissioner loeb 
the joker s telling us
who he s targeting 
get a unit over to surrillo s house 
tell wuertz to find dent 
get them both into protective custody 
where s the commissioner 
 city hall 
 seal the building 
 no one in or out till i get there 
 got it 
gordon  what are you up to 
we re secure  i want a floor by floor
search of the entire building 
sorry sir  we believe the joker s
made a threat against your life 
these are dangerous people  judge 
yea  but you re not giving me
an awful lot of information 
even we don t know
where you re going 
take the envelope  get in  open it 
it ll tell you where you re headed 
you can not leave me alone
with these people 
the whole mob s after you
and you re worried about these guys 
yeah  compared to this 
the mob doesn t scare me 
gordon  you re unlikely to discover this
for yourself  so   
   take my word  the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats 
i found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago 
them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly 
yeah  i bet 
yeah  it makes you think about things
you couldn t stand losing   
   about who you wanna spend the
rest of your life with 
 that s a pretty big commitment 
 well  not if the mob has their way 
you get to explain to my wife   
   why i m late for dinner  lieutenant 
sir  the joker card
had traces of your dna on it 
 don t do that 
 all right 
 let s be serious  then 
 okay 
what s your answer 
i don t have an answer 
how d they get my dna 
somebody with access
to your office or your house   
   must have lifted a tissue
or a glass   wait  wait  wait 
 well  i guess no answer is a no 
 harvey 
 it s someone else  isn t it 
 harvey

the guy s a complete f  
what are you doing 
oh  shit

i only have one question 
where is harvey dent 
you know where harvey is 
you know who he is 
hands up  pretty boy 
do you know where i can find harvey 
i need to talk to him about something 
just something little  huh  no

oh  thank god  you ve
got a panic room 
hey  wait  
oh  you gotta be kidding me 
you know  i ll settle for his loved ones 
we re not intimidated by thugs 
you know   
   you remind me of my father 
i hated my father 
okay  stop 
well  hello  beautiful 
you must be harvey s squeeze  hm 
and you are beautiful 
you look nervous  is it the scars 
you wanna know how i got them 
come here  hey 
look at me 
so i had a wife 
she was beautiful  like you   
   who tells me i worry too much   
   who tells me i ought to smile more   
   who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks  hey 
one day they carve her face 
and we have no money for surgeries 
she can t take it 
i just wanna see her smile again  hm 
i just want her to know
that i don t care about the scars 
so   
   i stick a razor in my mouth
and do this   
   to myself 
and you know what 
she can t stand the sight of me 
she leaves 
now i see the funny side 
now i m always smiling 
got a little fight in you  i like that 
then you re gonna love me 
drop the gun 
oh  sure  you just take off
your little mask   
   and show us all who
you really are  hm 
let her go 
very poor choice of words 
are you all right 
let s not do that again 
 is harvey okay 
 he s safe 
thank you 
jim  it s over 
as long as they don t get to lau 
we ve cut off their funds 
the prosecution s over 
nobody s standing up
in front of a judge   
   while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away 
 what about dent 
 he s got any sense   
   dent s halfway to mex  
so where do you keep your trash 
you re due in court  i need you alive
long enough to get you on the record 
you can t protect me 
you can t even protect yourselves 
you refuse to cooperate  you re not
coming back here  you go to county 
how long do you calculate
you ll last in there 
targeting me won t get their money back 
i knew the mob wouldn t go
down without a fight   
   but this is different 
they crossed a line 
you crossed the line first  sir 
you squeezed them  you hammered them
to the point of desperation 
and in their desperation  they turned to
a man they didn t fully understand 
criminals aren t complicated  alfred 
we just need to figure out
what he s after 
with respect  master wayne   
   perhaps this is a man
you don t fully understand either 
a long time ago  i was in burma   
   and my friends and i were working
for the local government 
they were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders   
   by bribing them with
precious stones   
   but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of rangoon by a bandit 
so we went looking for the stones 
but in six months  we never
met anyone who traded with him 
one day  i saw a child
playing with a ruby   
   the size of a tangerine 
the bandit had been
throwing them away 
 so why steal them 
 well  because he thought it was good sport 
because some men aren t looking
for anything logical  like money 
they can t be bought  bullied 
reasoned or negotiated with 
some men just wanna
watch the world burn 
your name  sir 
eighth and orchard 
you ll find harvey dent there 
check the names 
 richard dent  
 patrick harvey  
harvey dent 
i need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it 
us contaminate it 
it s because of you these guys are dead  
hey  detective 
give us a minute  guys 
that s brick underneath 
gonna take ballistics
off a shattered bullet 
no 
fingerprints 
whatever you re gonna do  do it fast 
because we found his next target 
he s put it in tomorrow s paper 
i m not sure
you made it loud enough  sir 
what can i do for you  mr  reese 
you wanted me to do the diligence
on the lsi holdings deal again 
well  i found some irregularities 
their ceo is in police custody 
no  not with their numbers  with yours 
applied sciences  whole division
of wayne enterprises   
   just disappeared overnight 
i went down to the archives
and i started pulling some old files 
don t tell me you didn t
recognize your baby out there   
   pancaking cop cars
on the evening news 
now you got the entire r d
department burning through cash   
   claiming it s related to
cell phones for the army 
what are you building for him now 
a rocket ship 
i want   
   10 million dollars a year
for the rest of my life 
let me get this straight 
you think that your client   
one of the wealthiest 
most powerful men in the world   
   is secretly a vigilante   
   who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare hands   
   and your plan
is to blackmail this person 
good luck 
well  
keep that 
this is your original scan 
here it is re engineered 
and there s the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip 
i ll get you a copy 
mr  wayne  did you reassign r d 
yeah  government
telecommunications project 
i wasn t aware
we had any government contracts 
lucius  i m playing this one
pretty close to the chest 
fair enough 
with no word from the batman   
   even as they mourn
commissioner loeb   
   these cops have to be wondering if
the joker will make good on his threat   
   in the obituary column of
the gotham times to kill the mayor 
i ve checked all the databases 
there are four possibles 
cross reference the addresses 
look for parkside 
overlooking the parade 
i got one 
melvin white 
1502 randolph apartments 
aggravated assault 
moved to arkham twice 
what do you got on the roof 
we re tight  but frankly 
there s a lot of windows up here 
commissioner loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement   
   and to the protection
of his community 
i remember when i first took office   
   and i asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner 
and he said he would  provided
i kept my politics out of his office 
clearly he was not a man who minced
words  nor should he have been 
a number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular 
policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters    
 who s that 
 what happened 
they took our guns 
and our uniforms 
and as we recognize
the sacrifice of this man   
   we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety 
stand by  honor guard 
attention  port arms 
ready  aim  fire 
ready  aim 
ready  aim 
stay down  don t move 
mr  mayor  get him out of here 
 i ll see you later 
 why are you going back 
get out of here 
tell me what you know about the joker 
no 
i m sorry  barbara 
jimmy  go play with your sister 
go ahead  honey 
if there s anything
we can do  anything you need   
   we re here for you 
shh 
are you out there 
are you  you brought this
craziness on us  you did 
you brought this on us 
switch it off  he ain t coming 
he doesn t wanna talk to us 
god help whoever
he does wanna talk to 
can t we go someplace quieter 
we can t hear each other talk 
what makes you think
i wanna hear you talk 
what 
 yeah 
second 
okay 
 harvey  where are you 
where are you 
i m where you should be 
at major crimes 
 i m trying to deal with all of this mess 
 rachel 
 can i get the fingerprint analysis 
 rachel  rachel  listen to me  you re not safe there 
 oh  this is gordon s unit 
 gordon s gone  rachel 
he vouched for these men 
 and he s gone 
the joker s named you next 
god  is there someone  is there anyone
in this town we can trust 
bruce 
we can trust bruce wayne 
no  rachel  c mon  i know
you re his friend  but  
harvey  trust me 
bruce s penthouse is now
the safest place in the city 
then you go straight there 
you don t tell anybody where you
are going and i ll find you there 
i love you 
i want the joker 
from one professional to another   
   if you re trying to scare somebody 
pick a better spot 
from this height 
the fall wouldn t kill me 
 i m counting on it 
 huh 
 where is he 
 i don t know where he is  he found us 
he must have friends 
friends  have you met this guy 
someone knows where he is 
nobody s gonna tell you nothing 
they re wise to your act 
you got rules 
the joker  he s got no rules 
nobody s gonna cross him for you 
if you want this guy  you got one way 
but you already know what that is 
just take off that mask 
let him come find you 
or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind 
you wanna play games 
how s that feel 
 you wouldn t 
 i wouldn t 
 you don t think i will 
 mm mm 
 you don t think i will 
 mm mm 
no  no  i wouldn t 
that s why i m not
gonna leave it up to me 
heads  you get to keep your head 
tails   
   not so lucky 
so you wanna tell me about the joker 
 let s go again 
 i don t know anything  i don t 
you re not playing the odds  friend 
let s do it again 
you d leave a man s life to chance 
 not exactly 
 his name s schiff  thomas 
he s a paranoid schizophrenic 
former patient at arkham 
the kind of mind the joker attracts 
what do you expect to learn from him 
the joker killed gordon 
he s gonna kill rachel 
you re the symbol of hope
i could never be 
your stand against organized crime   
   is the first legitimate ray of light
in gotham in decades 
if anyone saw this 
everything would be undone 
all the criminals you pulled off the
streets would be released   
   and jim gordon
will have died for nothing 
you re gonna hold a press
conference tomorrow morning 
 why 
 no one else will die because of me 
gotham s in your hands now 
you can t 
you can t give in 
you can t give in 
harvey called 
he said batman s gonna turn himself in 
i have no choice 
you honestly think that s gonna
keep the joker from killing people 
maybe not  but i have enough
blood on my hands 
and i ve seen now  what i would
have to become to stop men like him 
you once told me that
if the day came when i was finished   
   that we d be together 
bruce  don t make me
your one hope for a normal life 
did you mean it 
yes 
bruce 
if you turn yourself in 
they re not gonna let us be together 
logs as well 
everything 
anything that could lead back
to lucius or rachel 
people are dying  alfred 
what would you have me do 
endure  master wayne  take it 
they ll hate you for it 
but that s the point of batman 
he can be the outcast  he can make
the choice that no one else can make 
the right choice 
no  today i found out
what batman can t do 
he can t endure this 
today you get to say  i told you so  
today  i don t want to 
but i did bloody tell you 
i suppose they re gonna
lock me up as well   
   as your accomplice 
accomplice  i m gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea 
ladies and gentlemen  thank you for coming 
i ve called this press conference for two reasons 
firstly  to assure the citizens
of gotham   
   that everything that can be done
over the joker killings is being done 
secondly  because the batman
has offered to turn himself in 
but first  let s consider the situation 
should we give in
to this terrorist s demands 
do we really think he s gonna   
you d rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens 
the batman is an outlaw 
but  that s not why we
demand he turn himself in   
   we re doing it because we re scared 
we ve been happy to let the batman
clean up our streets for us until now 
things are worse than ever 
amen 
yes  they are 
but the night is darkest
just before the dawn 
and i promise you   
   the dawn is coming 
one day  the batman will have to answer
for the laws he s broken  but to us   
   not to this madman 
 no more dead cops 
yeah 
he should turn himself in 
give us the batman  come on 
where is he 
so be it  take the batman into custody 
what 
is he here 
i am the batman 
what 
come on 
alfred 
why is he letting harvey do this 
 he went down to the press conference 
 i know  he just stood by 
perhaps both bruce and mr  dent   
   believe that batman stands for
something more important   
   than the whims of a terrorist 
miss dawes   
   even if everyone hates him for it 
that s the sacrifice he s making 
he s not being a hero 
he s being something more 
yeah  you re absolutely right 
letting harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all 
you know him better than anyone 
i do 
will you give this to him for me 
when the time is right 
how will i know 
it s not sealed 
goodbye  alfred 
bye  rachel 
sorry  i didn t have time to talk
this through with you 
what are you doing 
they re transferring me
to central holding 
this is the joker s chance  and when he
attacks  the batman will take him down 
listen to me  this is too dangerous 
we get this guy to county 
he s their problem 
streets will be
cleared along your route   
   so let s go 
convoy stops for no reason 
i hope you got some moves  pal 
he s using you as bait  he doesn t
even know if he can get the joker 
he s failed so far 
how do you know
what he s thinking 
i just    i do  anyway  harvey 
this isn t just about you 
what about all of the people
who are depending on you   
   to clean the city up
and do it honorably and   
harvey  tell everyone the truth 
heads  i go through with it 
this is your life  you can t leave
something like that to chance 
i m not 
you make your own luck 
hey  you wait like everybody else  pal 
what the hell is that 
obstruction ahead  obstruction ahead 
damn it  all units divert down
onto lower fifth  i repeat  exit down 
exit down 
lower fifth  we ll be like turkeys
on thanksgiving down there 
jesus  come on  get us out of here 
let s go 
listen  we need backup 
we ve got company 
we got trouble  guys 
lock and load 
what the hell was that 
 these things are built for that  right 
 he s gonna need something   
   a lot bigger to get through this 
what is that

i didn t sign up for this 
look out

who did you leave him with 
hm  your people 
assuming  of course 
that they are still your people   
   and not maroni s 
does it depress you  commissioner   
   to know just how alone you really are 
does it make you feel responsible
for harvey dent s current predicament 
 where is he

well  depending on the time 
he may be in one spot or several 
 if we re gonna play games

hello there 
back at the mcu  the joker s gone 
with lau 
the joker planned to be caught 
he wanted me to lock him up
in the mcu 
dear bruce 
i need to be honest and clear 
i m going to marry harvey dent 
i love him  and i wanna spend
the rest of my life with him 
when i told you that if gotham no longer
needed batman  we could be together   
   i meant it 
but now i m sure the day won t come
when you no longer need batman 
i hope it does 
and if it does  i will be there   
   but as your friend 
i m sorry  harvey 
i m sorry to let you down 
if you lose your faith in me 
please keep your faith in people 
love  now and always  rachel 
prepared a little breakfast 
 very well  then 
 alfred 
yes  master wayne 
did i bring this on her 
i was meant to inspire good   
   not madness  not death 
you have inspired good  but you spat
in the faces of gotham s criminals 
didn t you think
there might be some casualties 
things are always going to get worse
before they got better 
but rachel  alfred 
rachel believed in what you stood for   
   what we stand for 
gotham needs you 
no  gotham needs its true hero   
   and i let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell 
which is why  for now   
   they re gonna have to
make do with you 
she was going to wait for me  alfred 
dent doesn t know 
he can never know 
what s that 
 it can wait 
 that bandit   
   in the forest in burma 
 did you catch him 
 yes 
how 
we burned the forest down 
he s credible source  an m a lawyer
from a prestigious consultancy  and
he says he s waited as long as he can
for the batman to do the right thing 
and now he s taking matters
into his own hands 
we ll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the batman 
i m sorry about rachel 
the doctor says you re in agonizing pain 
but that you won t accept medication 
that you re refusing to   
   accept skin grafts 
remember that name   
   you all had for me   
   when i was at internal affairs 
what was it  gordon 
harvey  i    
say it 
say it 
two face  harvey two face 
why should i hide who i am 
i know you tried to warn me 
i m sorry 
wuertz picked you up 
was he working for them 
do you know who picked up rachel 
harvey  i need to know
which of my men i can trust 
why would you listen to me now 
i m sorry  harvey 
no 
no  you re not 
not yet 
this craziness  it s too much 
you should ve thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box 
you want him 
i can tell you
where he ll be this afternoon 
not so crazy as you look 
i told you  i m a man of my word 
where is the italian 
all tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes 
i want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes 
please 
joker man  what you do
with all your money 
you see  i m a guy of simple taste 
i enjoy   
   dynamite   
   and gunpowder   
   and gasoline 
 what the   
 ah  ah  ah 
and you know the thing
that they have in common 
they re cheap 
i wanna know how much they are paying
you to say who batman really is 
this is our chance  i want lau alive 
the joker  either way 
hey  jim  get a load of this 
let s take the next caller 
harvey dent didn t wanna
give in to this maniac 
you think you know better than him 
i think that if we could talk to dent
today  he may feel differently 
and we wish him a speedy recovery 
because god knows  we need him now 
you said you were a man of your word 
oh  i am 
i m only burning my half 
all you care about is money 
this town deserves
a better class of criminal   
   and i m gonna give it to them 
tell your men they work for me now 
this is my city 
they won t work for a freak 
 freak  
why don t we
cut you up into little pieces   
   and feed you to your pooches  hm 
and then we ll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is 
it s not about money   
   it s about sending a message 
everything burns 
 who is this 
i had a vision   
   of a world without batman 
the mob ground out a little profit   
   and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time 
and it was so boring 
i ve had a change of heart 
i don t want mr  reese
spoiling everything   
   but why should i have all the fun 
let s give someone else a chance 
if coleman reese
isn t dead in 60 minutes   
   then i blow up a hospital 
i want you to call in every officer 
tell them to head to their nearest
hospital and start evac and search 
call the transit authority 
school board  prisons 
get every available bus down to a hospital 
the priority is gotham general  wheel
everybody out of that place right now 
you  you and you  you come with me 
 where are we going  sir 
 to get reese 
i need you plugged in  checking
gordon s men and their families 
 looking for 
 hospital admissions 
will you be wanting the batpod  sir

   an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man 
sir  commissioner

no immediate family member
admitted to a gotham hospital 
they re trying to kill me 
 well  maybe batman can save you 
davis  they got space  bring him out 
davis 
i saw burns and zachary 
nothing on them 
and a patrolman i don t know 
okay  so  what now 
what do we do now 
where are we going 
send the information to gordon 
get out of here 
davis 
ma am  we re gonna have to
move him now 
it s berg  isn t it 
 commissioner 
you okay  son 
hi 
you know   
   i don t want there to be
any hard feelings between us  harvey 
 when you and  
 rachel 
  rachel were being abducted   
   i was sitting in gordon s cage 
i didn t rig those charges 
your men  your plan 
do i really look like a guy with a plan 
you know what i am 
i m a dog chasing cars 
i wouldn t know what to do with one
if i caught it 
you know  i just do things 
the mob has plans  the cops have plans 
gordon s got plans 
you know  they re schemers 
schemers trying to control
their little worlds 
i m not a schemer 
i try to show the schemers   
   how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are 
so when i say   ah  come here 
when i say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal   
   you know that i m telling the truth 
 i m gonna need your weapon 
 what 
why  because my wife s in the hospital 
yeah  that would be why 
it s the schemers
that put you where you are 
you were a schemer  you had plans   
   and look where that got you 
the police  of course 
are taking every possible precaution   
   and urging everyone not to
take matters into their hands 
i just did what i do best 
i took your little plan 
i turned it on itself 
look what i did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a couple of bullets 
hm  you know   
you know what i noticed 
nobody panics when
things go  according to plan  
even if the plan is horrifying 
if tomorrow i tell the press that  like 
a gangbanger will get shot   
   or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up   
   nobody panics 
because it s all part of the plan 
but when i say that
one little old mayor will die   
   well  then  everyone loses their minds 
introduce a little anarchy   
   upset the established order   
   and everything becomes chaos 
i m an agent of chaos 
oh  and you know the thing
about chaos 
it s fair 
 you live 
 mm hm 
you die 
mmm  now we re talking 
mr  reese 
that s mr  wayne  isn t it 
 that was a very brave thing you did 
 trying to catch the light 
 you weren t protecting the van 
 why  who s in it 
don t you think
i should go to the hospital 
you don t watch a whole lot of news 
do you  mr  wayne 
southeast 
it s gotham general 
 did you clear the building 
yeah 
we must know
how many were inside 
you have patient lists  roll call 
right now we re showing
50 people missing  one bus 
all these others buses were heading off to
other hospitals  my guess is we missed one 
yeah  well  what s your guess
about where harvey dent is 
keep looking  and keep it to yourself 
anybody asks  we got him out 
get me the mayor s office on the line 
we re gonna need the national guard 
  people are still missing   
   including gcn s own mike engel 
i m now being told that we re cutting to
a video gcn has just received 
i m mike engel for gotham tonight 
what does it take to make you
people wanna join in 
you failed to kill the lawyer 
i ve gotta get you off the bench   
    and into the game 
bench  game 
come nightfall  this city is mine 
mine 
 and anyone left here plays by my rules 
 rules 
mr  fox  security is showing
a break in at the r d department 
if you don t wanna be in the game   
    get out now 
 get out now 
but the bridge and tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise 
ha ha  ha ha 
gotham p d  has shut down   
 sweet jesus 
    the bridges and tunnels across the area 
shouldn t you be out there 
you know  doing something 
it s my day off 
i gotta take a leak 
keep an eye out for me  will you 
now what 
you need someone to shake it for you 
hello 
dent 
jesus  i thought you was dead 
half 
who picked up rachel  wuertz 
 it must ve been maroni s men 
 shut up 
are you telling me
that you re gonna protect   
   the other traitor in gordon s unit 
i don t know  he never told me 
listen  dent  i swear to god  i didn t
know what they were gonna do to you 
that s funny   
   because i don t know
what s gonna happen to you either 
beautiful  isn t it 
beautiful 
unethical 
dangerous 
you ve turned every cell phone
in gotham into a microphone 
and a high frequency generator receiver 
you took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city 
with half the city feeding you sonar 
you can image all of gotham 
this is wrong 
i ve gotta find this man  lucius 
at what cost 
the database is null key encrypted 
it can only be accessed by one person 
this is too much power for one person 
that s why i gave it to you 
only you can use it 
spying on 30 million people
isn t part of my job description 
this is an audio sample  if he talks
within range of any phone in the city   
   you can triangulate his position 
i ll help you this one time 
but consider this my resignation 
as long as this machine is
at wayne enterprises  i won t be 
when you re finished   
   type in your name 
well  my officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges   
   but with the joker s threat 
they re not an option 
 and land routes east 
 backed up for hours 
which leaves the ferries
with 30 000 ready to board 
plus  i wanna use the ferries so i can
get some of those prisoners off the island 
the men you and dent put away 
those aren t people i m worried about 
you should be 
whatever the joker s planning   
   it s a good bet harvey s prisoners might be involved 
i wanna get them out of here 
so where is harvey 
 we haven t found him 
 oh  jesus 
how long can you keep this quiet 
don t stop for lights  cops  nothing 
going to join your wife 
 you love her 
 yes 
you ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die 
look  take it up with the joker 
he killed your woman  he made you   
   like this 
the joker s just a mad dog 
i want whoever let him off the leash 
i took care of wuertz  but who is
your other man inside gordon s unit 
who picked up rachel 
must have been someone she trusted 
look  if i tell you   
   will you let me go 
can t hurt your chances 
it was ramirez 
 but you said  
 i said it couldn t hurt your chances 
you re a lucky man 
 but he s not 
 who 
your driver 
stand back 
hey man  that ain t right 
we should be on that boat 
you wanna ride across
with them  be my guest 
sir  they ve stopped their engines 
right  get on the radio 
tell them we ll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scumbags 
liberty  this is spirit  come in 
what the heck was that 
what the   
liberty  come in  please 
this is spirit  come in 
liberty  we have the same thing 
we ve lost both engines 
 liberty  come in 
fox 
there s something going on
on the ferries 
get down to the engine room now 
hey  buddy  what s happening 
captain  we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow  and this 
oh  my god 
looks like some kind of detonator 
why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb 
tonight  you re all gonna be   
   a part of a social experiment 
through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate   
   i m ready right now
to blow you all sky high 
liberty  come in  over 
it s dead 
if anyone attempts
to get off their boat  you all die 
i m zeroing in 
each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat 
his voice is on the ferry   
   but it s not the source 
west 
 gordon 
i have the joker s location 
prewitt building 
assemble on the building opposite 
at midnight  i blow you all up 
if  however  one of you presses
the button  i ll let that boat live 
so who s it gonna be 
harvey dent s most wanted
scumbag collection   
   or the sweet and innocent civilians 
you choose 
oh  and you might wanna
decide quickly   
   because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble 
stay back 
well  now  who are you to decide 
we ought to talk this over  at least 
we don t all have to die 
those men had their chance 
 we are not going to talk about this 
 why aren t we talking about it 
they re talking over the same exact
thing on the other boat 
 let s put it to a vote 
yes 
 hello 
barbara  it s anna ramirez 
jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away 
but the units outside    
those cops can t be trusted 
jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible 
i ll call them off for 10 minutes 
and you ll have to move fast 
 but where am i supposed to take them 
 250 52nd street 
leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out 
okay 
she believe you 
it s because she trusts you   
   just like rachel did 
 i didn t know  
 didn t know what they were gonna do 
you re the second cop to say that to me 
what exactly did you think
they were gonna do 
they got me early on 
my mother s hospital bills    
 don t 
 i m sorry 
you live to fight another day  officer 
we found the missing hospital bus 
and we have a hostage situation 
it s a shooting gallery 
why would he choose a spot
with such big windows 
we have clear shots on five clowns 
snipers take them out 
smash the windows  a team rappels in 
team moves in by the stairwells 
two  three casualties max 
 let s do it 
it s not that simple 
 with the joker  it never is 
 what s simple is that
every second we don t take in 
those people on the ferries get closer
to blowing each other up  
 that won t happen 
 then he ll blow both of them up 
 we don t have time for paper ballots 
 i want everybody to put their votes   
   on this piece of paper 
if anyone s got pens  pass it along 
thank you  anybody else  coming
through  anybody else  thank you 
we need to get these votes in quickly 
come on 
what are you waiting for 
just push the button

i need five minutes alone 
no  there s no time 
we have clear shots 
dent is in there with them

clowns  put down your guns

freeze 
stand down or you will be  
look up

they re waiting to ambush
the swat team coming up the elevator 
sixty seconds 
the tally is 140 against  396 for 
so go ahead  do it 
we re still here 
and that means they haven t
killed us yet either

doctors are targets 
ah  you made it  i m so thrilled 
 where s the detonator 
 go get him 
put down your weapon 
don t move 
you don t wanna die   
   but you don t know how to take a life 
give it to me 
these men will kill you
and take it anyway 
no one wants to get their hands dirty 
fine  i ll do it 
those men on that boat 
they made their choices 
they chose to murder and steal 
it doesn t make any sense
for us to have to die too 
all the old familiar places 
stand by 
red team  floor secure 
hostages are safe 
give it to me 
you can tell them i took it by force 
give it to me  and i ll do what
you should ve did 10 minutes ago 
we really should stop this fighting 
otherwise we ll miss the fireworks 
there won t be any fireworks 
and here we go 
what were you trying to prove 
that deep down 
everyone s as ugly as you 
you re alone 
can t rely on anyone these days  you
gotta do everything yourself  don t we 
that s okay  i came prepared 
it s a funny world we live in  speaking of
which  you know how i got these scars 
no  but i know how you got these 
oh  you 
you just couldn t let me go  could you 
this is what happens
when an unstoppable force   
   meets an immovable object 
you truly are incorruptible  aren t you 
huh  you won t kill me   
   out of some misplaced sense
of self righteousness 
and i won t kill you   
   because you re just too much fun 
i think you and i are destined
to do this forever 
you ll be in a padded cell forever 
maybe we could share one 
you know 
they ll be doubling up   
   the rate this city s inhabitants
are losing their minds 
this city just showed you   
   that it s full of people
ready to believe in good 
until their spirit breaks completely 
until they get a good look
at the real harvey dent   
   and all the heroic things he s done 
you didn t think i d risk losing the battle
for gotham s soul   
   in a fistfight with you 
no 
you need an ace in the hole 
mine s harvey 
what did you do 
i took gotham s white knight   
   and i brought him down to our level 
it wasn t hard 
see  madness  as you know   
   is like gravity 
all it takes is a little push 
dent 
this is where they brought her 
gordon  after your men handed her over 
this is where she died 
i know  i was here   
    trying to save her 
 but you didn t 
 i couldn t 
 yes  you could ve 
if you d listened to me 
if you stood up against corruption   
   instead of doing your deal
with the devil 
i was trying to fight the mob 
you wouldn t dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what i d lost 
have you ever had to talk to the
person you loved most   
   tell them it s gonna be all right 
when you know it s not 
well  you re about to know
what that feels like  gordon 
then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you re sorry 
 you re not going to hurt my family 
 no 
just the person you love most 
so is it your wife 
put the gun down  harvey 
harvey  put down the gun 
please  please  harvey  please 
oh  goddamn it 
will you stop pointing that gun
at my family 
no 
 we have a winner 
no  jim  stop him 
harvey 
don t let him  
harvey 
i m sorry 
for everything 
please don t hurt my son 
you brought your cops 
all they know is there s a situation 
they don t know who or what 
they re just creating a perimeter 
you think i wanna escape from this 
there is no escape from this 
you don t wanna hurt the boy  harvey 
it s not about what i want 
it s about what s fair 
you thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time 
but you were wrong 
the world is cruel  and the only morality
in a cruel world   
   is chance 
unbiased 
unprejudiced 
fair 
his son s got the same chance she had 
fifty fifty 
what happened to rachel wasn t
chance  we decided to act 
we three 
then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything 
 it wasn t 
 the joker chose me 
because you were the best of us 
he wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you   
   could fall 
and he was right 
you re the one pointing the gun  harvey 
so point it at the people responsible 
fair enough 
you first 
my turn 
harvey  you re right 
rachel s death was my fault 
please don t punish the boy 
 please  punish me 
 i m about to 
tell your boy
he s gonna be all right  gordon 
lie   
   like i lied 
it s going to be all right  son 
no 
dad  daddy  is he okay 
 thank you 
 you don t have to thank me 
yes  i do 
the joker won 
harvey s prosecution 
everything he fought for   
   undone 
whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with harvey s reputation 
we bet it all on him 
the joker took the best of us
and tore him down 
people will lose hope 
they won t 
they must never know what he did 
five dead 
two of them cops 
 you can t sweep that  
 no 
but the joker cannot win 
gotham needs its true hero 
 no 
 you either die a hero   
   or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain 
i can do those things   
   because i m not a hero  not like dent 
i killed those people 
that s what i can be 
no  no  you can t  you re not 
i m whatever gotham needs me to be 
call it in 
a hero 
not the hero we deserved 
but the hero we needed 
nothing less than a knight   
   shining 
they ll hunt you 
you ll hunt me 
you ll condemn me 
set the dogs on me 
because that s what needs to happen 
because sometimes   
   the truth isn t good enough 
sometimes people deserve more 
sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded 
batman 
batman 
why s he running  dad 
because we have to chase him 
okay  we re going in  go  go  move 
he didn t do anything wrong 
because he s the hero gotham deserves 
but not the one it needs right now 
so we ll hunt him   
   because he can take it 
because he s not our hero
