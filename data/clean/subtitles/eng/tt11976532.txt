people chattering
ben i figured it out
eloise figured what out
america
laughing okay
i know youre laughing
but i have a pitch
youre really gonna like
america is divided
but its not for the
reason that we think
we think that americas
divided by geography
red state blue
state city country
were missing something
far more profound
america isnt divided by space
america is divided by time
we dont live in the moment anymore
mm
and why would we when
we can live in any moment
thats ever been recorded
and when we experience
something we really love
our overwhelming instinct
is to somehow file
it away for later
thats interesting
we dont watch movies
in the theater
we dont watch tv when it airs
we dont even have
conversations at the same time
because we text
and when you text
i can say hi
and you could say
hi back in a second
or a minute
or never
or never cause its you
and youre too busy producing
the biggest podcast in america
which is kind of my point
because were all living
in our own individualized times
thats why were living
in divided times
thats i like that ooh
you like that
yeah
so what do you think do
you think thats a story
its a theory
a theory is a story
no a theory is not a story
yes it is when
its about an idea
and america is an idea
thats what makes it so great
so if youre
no america is its people
thats what makes
it so fucked up
hey not every white
guy in new york
needs to have a podcast
chuckling
you have the
verified check mark
you got the new yorker position
i want something more
i dont just want
to be a writer
i i want to be a voice
as dorky as it sounds
i care about america
and not in that faded
lana del rey way
and now i see it falling apart
and were just
standing in the corner
like making fun
of it you know
id like to try to tell
some story that connects
okay okay well then
let me help you connect
with all your ideas
about america
even if theyre good right
you gotta put em in a story
cause americans
listen to stories
cause americans are people
theyre not ideas
youreyoure here
yeah
you need to be here
does that make sense

an overdose scoffs
at a party in an oil field
yeah the girl never took so
much as an advil in her life
you know that you know
her better than anybody
did you call the
police about this
in texas we dont dial 911
not even for like a fire
fire or ambulance fine
who do you think did it
i got a couple theories
cartels mexican gangbanger
i got my eyes on
i mean this is
just the beginning
it goes deep
and whats this based on
gut
right whats
behind that though
aint nothing behind gut
guts behind everything
else otherwise who are you
i really think this is
something for the police
yeah you talk about the police
like its just the
same everywhere
like the police
is um mcdonalds
and justice is an egg mcmuffin
we dont have the police
we got mike and dan
you and me we were
the men in her life
and they fucked with
the wrong two guys
okay um
so as like a
personal boundary
like everybodys different
some people dont
eat certain foods
you know everybody
i dont avenge deaths
mmhmm

i you know i dont live
in a liam neeson movie

way back from a funeral

its okay its not
someone i was close to
but you flew to texas for it
uh yes
uh it was a girl i hooked
up with a few times
you flew to texas
to attend the funeral
of a random hookup
her family thought that we
were more serious than i did
do you know what
this is a story
yeah
yeah
its you
thethe your
whole way of life
its dating its
hookup culture
how it enables disconnectedness
the selfishness
no
the emptiness
no
the hollowness
thats not what i meant
the lack of selfawareness
okay thats not
what im pitching
its really how
sad your life is
okay now youre
fucking with me
listen im in west texas
where this family just
lost their daughter
to an opioid overdose
that is sad but common
except her brother wont
accept its an overdose
he says it was a murder
based on what
nothing
and thats the story
this is an existential
crime story
this is in cold blood
but there are no killers
this is about a new
american reality
that people cant accept
so instead they invent
these myths and conspiracies
so they can cast themselves
as heroes because
the truth is too hard to accept
the death of abilene is about
the death of american identity
and the need to find
someone to blame for it
this isnt just a
story about vengeance
its a story about the
need for vengeance
the meaning of vengeance

godforsaken stretch of land

feel about twitter
paris mm
ty see bens a journalist
one of the finest there is
he writes for the
new york magazine
ben new yorker yep
and hes gonna help us find out
what really happened to abilene
i was saying we go out
and settle with a 45
but ben gives a whole new
perspective to the situation
ty you cant solve something
like this with a 45
its not as simple
as one person
its a whole system son
tell us what you mean granny
its the breakdown of
society is what it is
its the breakdown
of the school system
the government
ty mm
its the pharmaceutical
companies
its the breakdown of the family
and tradition
oh theres a whole lot
of people responsible
for what happened to abilene
sharon thats true
yes maam
paris amen
i think thats very wise
youre gonna need a
12gauge couple of ars
no yep
a wesson automatic
no no no
and a sidearm for safety
yep exactly
were not doing that
granny oh were not yeah
i didnt think
you had the balls
are you gonna help us ben
you know um
ben clears throat
theres some things im good at
im good at asking
the right questions
im good at getting
people to talk
and im especially good at
drawing thematic connections
between seemingly
disparate elements
and using that to illustrate
a larger point or theory
so whoever or whatever
is responsible for what
happened to abilene
i will find this person
or this generalized
societal force
and i will define it
ill define it
bless your heart
i guess we have
a guest room now
ty
well rest up good
well meet in the morning

clicks button
quentin okay
vocalizing stops
hi
hi
what is music
like singing and stuff
yeah thats right
lets take a step back
i want to share
an idea with you
theres no argument
more profound
than how the universe
came into existence
quietly oh god
are we here because of god
or science
i mean it is by
its very nature
the most fundamental question
but theres one thing
that everyone agrees on
and that is whether
it was god declaring
let there be light
or an infinite
particle of energy
bursting forth in the big bang
everyone
and i mean everyone
agrees that the universe
started with a sound
why do i call myself
a record producer
i dont know
quentin chuckles
yeah i mean we dont
even make records anymore
chuckles quietly
what were recording
here isnt your record
its your sound
on the record that started
with the very first
moment in time
so when you sing this song
i want you to think about
how what youre making
is the record of your
time here on this earth
its the sound that you scratch
with your life
on the record of the universe
okay
okay
button clicks
gentle beat begins
i finished my
shift at claires
climbed up those
steep mall stairs
and the pain of
having nowhere to go
pierced the skin of my soul
as i sat on the steps
and waited and waited
for no one to take me home
yeah
thank you
quentin i call this
place the factory
you know after andy warhols factory
hmm
most people around here
think its a reference
to cc music factory
which honestly ii think
warhol wouldve loved but
yeah actually yeah
im from out here
i went to college in new haven
ben oh i went to
school in boston
quentin yeah i thought
about staying there
but this is the place that
needs something like this
the problem isnt that
people arent smart
the problem is that they are
if the landscape is like this
aand people were just boring
you wouldnt have this problem
the problem is you get all
these bright creative lights
and nowhere to plug
in their energy
and so it gets channeled
into conspiracy theories
and drugs and violence
who are your favorite
music artists right now
ben exhales um
quentin can i take a guess
yeah
quentin youre
a playlist guy
ben what does that mean
quentin when some computer
recommends you a bunch of songs
based on your favorites
and a bunch more
based on your favorites of those
right
so youre listening to
a bunch of music that
i mean you genuinely like
yeah
but you have no
idea who sings it
now these playlists its
like the dating app for music
youre not hearing
other peoples voices
youre just hearing your
voice get played back at you
how are you supposed
to fall in love
art used to be in charge of us
you used to buy a whole album
not even knowing what
songs would be on it
now we have
everything on demand
at your fingertips
in pieces
you think half the people
that are posting quotes
from oscar wilde have ever
actually read one of his plays
no
or posting photos
of audrey hepburn
have actually seen the
film that its from
no
not a chance right
what is that about huh
its the same in culture
as it is in archaeology
when a civilization collapses
only the tiniest
fragments remain
but we can build it back again
how
make recordings
real people
not what people think
that they already know
and want to hear
real people
not some generic
stereotype or generic song
real people
whats this podcast
about anyway
well um its about america
okay
its about the myths
that we tell ourselves
who is it about
all of us
every story we tell is
ultimately about a person
abilene shaw
abilene
yeah
youre making a
podcast about abilene
well its a little
about abilene
im trying to make it more about
no
its about abilene
the person

what about my voice
ill put you in the studio
what do you want to do
ii you know
if i came here for advice
about my voice my
you know my
writing my podcast
what would you tell me
id probably say that
nobody writes anything
all we do is translate
so if you ever get stuck and
you dont know what to say
just listen
even to the silences
listen as hard as you can to
the world around you and
repeat back what you hear
that translation
thats your voice
chuckles
i gotta say this

vengeance is a
unique phenomenon
ty whispers texas
invented vengeance
ben it makes no sense
if you think about it
every other primal
human instinct
leads to a clear
evolutionary reward
but vengeance is different
its not about the future
its only about the past
ty when that massacre
happened we didnt retreat
we didnt say lets all make
sure we dont get mexiphobia
we said remember the alamo
ben its not about hope
its about regret
sharon over headphones abby

music of course
oh she had such
a beautiful voice
i really wish more
people couldve heard it
granny youre a writer

the desperation that

a gun in act one of a play
theres no guns in any one
of his plays i can think of
cherry orchard no

we dismissed the
first theory presented
without even thinking about it
what if were not
taking them seriously
wait so are you saying the
mexican drug dealer did it
definitely not that
but that was the first
theory presented
im just sure it wasnt that
why are you so sure
gut
gut
look
i know we liked
what we had before
something about america
and fantasy and regret
and the meaning of vengeance
no no this this is better
this just keeps getting
bigger and bigger
right
okay
stay safe
get the story
not in that order
no in that order
phone beeps
breathes deeply
no audio
hinges creaking
what are you watching

it makes me look
the way that i feel
um
door creaks closed
snoring softly
mike where do
i know you from
rodeo
snaps fingers
its the longhorns fan
indeed it is
mike indeed it is
actually that was
a misunderstanding
im sorry im not
even a football fan
um i was just trying to fit in
funny way to fit in around here
point taken
i didnt know there was
gonna be another team
i was cheering for texas
um
id love to ask you
a couple questions
about the death of abilene shaw
odd
accident
i know that was the
official report
i was wondering were you
able to talk to anyone
who was there the
night she died
you ever go to a party
out by the pump jacks
everybody goes and
nobody was there
i wasnt there
whispers i wasnt there
both laughing
why are you so
interested anyway
you her uh boyfriend
or something
uh we hung out
yeah yeah i was her boyfriend
well you know 90 of the time
its the boyfriend who did it
okay i wasnt i wasnt
really her boyfriend
his storys starting to
sound a little inconsistent
sighs heavily swiss cheese
yeah um im not trying
to cause any problems here
im really just trying
to help the family
you know this isnt even
our jurisdiction anyways
dan sighs
party happened
outside city limits
mm
thats county not city
county sheriff
sheriffll talk
sheriffs a politician
laughs aint that a fact
id love to help you son but
our policy is we cant comment
on our process or cases
well i was interviewing
people for a podcast
that could be heard
by millions of people
but i guess thats
not a possibility
sheriff these are oxy sticks
see how the pills
are squared off
that way they can pack
em in boxes to the corners
without wasting any space
mmhmm
thats how big this business is
we dont know whos shipping it
all we know is theyre
coming along the interstate
right along the border
and that route cuts
right by the oil field
where the party was
sheriff the most common
overdose spot in the county
we call it the afterparty
very common thing sad to say
ben whats this right here
looks like two pairs of prints
cowboy boots
calling out an apb to find
two men wearing cowboy boots
laughter
okay
man over radio what the fuck
stand down
son i wish you
well i really do
and bless your little heart
but this aint even our
jurisdiction though
its not
no sir
this was along the highway
you want to talk
to highway patrol
well aint that just like a
sheriff to puff his hot air
and blow you straight
into my office
if theres a drug
overdose at a party
in some fucking field off 29
im sorry but we
got shit to do
were not a bunch
of army rejects
just gazing at the rio grande
i never said that you were
i wasnt talking about us
oh is that what they told
you over at highway patrol
well you can go
tell junior brown
and the rest of them
glorified meter maids
that if they spent more
time with their real guns
and less with their radar guns
we might not have to chase
the goddamn texas syndicate
up and down the transpecos
got it
yes if i find a natural way
to work that into the
conversation with them
i will do that
drt
drt
drt
dead right there
ben over phone law
enforcement was no help at all
youre learning a lot
down there arent you
the murder or overdose
happened where a lot
of these things happen
at the intersection of four
overlapping jurisdictions
so they all kicked
it to each other
what are the odds
eloise what are the odds
okay im gonna kick this around
with the team for a little
bit shake up the boggle board
and then im gonna hit up
robin to get her thoughts
ben all right thanks
eloise thanks everybody
bye ben
bye ben
sighs
um youre probably not
even gonna watch this
but im back home in
texas and im bored
this is my little
brother mason
snoring
he sleeps on my floor
because hes afraid of ghosts
and i tried to tell him
theres no such thing
as ghosts but whatever
it keeps him close to me
so i guess its not
all bad being here
thats um
well thats it
el stupido snoring softly
mason
yes sir
just saying good night
you woke me up just
to say good night
yes sir
sighs heavily
i love you mucho
ty collective consciousness
ben if everyone believes
the same thing
but without any
facts to support it
do we listen to that
intuition or dismiss it
ty an overdose
girl never took so much
as an advil in her life
crawl she never touched
so much as an advil
mike you ever go to a
party out by the pump jacks
everybody goes nobody went
dan and mike i wasnt there
laughing
quentin the problem is
you get all these bright
creative lights and nowhere
to plug in their energy
and so it gets channeled
into conspiracy theories
and drugs and violence
ben i came here to find
out why people in grief
would choose to believe a myth
crawl i dont know shit
about how this all connects
but you bet your ass it does
ms13 la línea
ben yeah im
familiar with la línea
they actually murdered
41 journalists last year
crawl oh theyve
done bad things too
ty laughing
ben but now i find
myself wondering
how much truth might be
embedded in that intuition
you dont happen to know
her phone password do you
took it to every geek
squad in the state
its impossible to crack
this aint us
you got the wrong department
highway patrol mike and dan
border patrol

ending without resolution
thats thats the secret
weapon with a story like this
it gnaws at you
it haunts you forever
you never let it go
ben no theres
more to it eloise
iim getting so close
eloise as much as
wed love to see you
blown up for a story
no no
my conscience tells me
i have to choose a
person over a story
no
no no
otherwise it would take
like two years of therapy
to justify it and
i cant afford that on my plan
look youre gonna
be huge from this
okay
come home
phone beeping
breathes deeply
you remember
sharon hey you
hey sorry about that
el stupido who was that
friend
was it equinox girl cute
or was it natalie bumble
uh it was uh my
podcast producer
uh and everythings on track
youre very sweet to ask
i love you mucho
were so lucky
you found abilene
i really dont know
what she saw in me
sharon i do
i get it i totally get it
heart sees heart
oh laughs softly
you know when i came down here
to spend time with abbys
crazy texan family right
laughs yeah
uh i never thought
it would be like this
people can surprise you
yeah
like abilene
i mean she was
full of surprises
like abilene
mmhmm
great reputation but
a huge pillpopper
what
whatd you just say
mm put that in
your podcast maybe
whered you hear that
the girls told me
ty told us not to say anything
are you fucking serious
i thought you wouldnt
do this with me
if you knew that she was using
you think
drugs was something abilene did
its not who she was
but it is how she died
which is what we
were investigating
i thought there
was more to this
i thought that you and i
would get to know each other
and that would be cool
i maybe it was part
of the grieving process
denial
isnt that one of the
12 steps of grief
its five stages of grief
12 steps to recovery
but i understand
that everyone here
is more familiar
with the latter
its complicated
its not its
actually very simple
everything here is
actually really simple
and maybe thats why
it took me so long
to understand it
well i was following my heart
and thats what
we do around here
you follow your heart
yeah
well maybe its
time to look around
and ask yourselves how
thats working out for you
maybe you should try following
your brain for a change
because when you
follow your heart
the earth is flat
climate change is a hoax
vaccines contain microchips
and mexican drug dealers
killed your sister
you invent these insane
fucking narratives
to explain why your
lives are such shit shows
because the truth is too
scary for you to face
which is that you
did it to yourselves
do you know what people say
about you guys where im from
let me guess bad things
no worse
we say good things
we took them seriously
when we shouldve
taken them literally
youre neither
youre not serious people
and maybe its time for you all
to take us seriously
and literally
because where im from
is fun and interesting
and the people are
rich and diverse
and meanwhile your
town looks like this
bless your heart
oh and i know what that means
so you know what
bless your heart
bless your heart
bless all your hearts

ben coughing
coughs
now youve been in a fight
ben coughs
i dont know the whole story
but life is complicated
even around here if
you can believe that
ill tell you what i think
i think people dont
do drugs for no reason
they do drugs because
theyre in pain
pain like
like maybe caring for someone
who hardly knows your name
so i dont know ben
but if youre still looking
for someone to blame
for what happened
you may not have needed
to come all this way
bless your heart

i am the story and
the story sucks

el stupido ghosts
ghosts arent real
if theyre not real how come
everyone knows what they are
theyre real as an idea

thats whats scary about
ghosts that they arent real
if ghosts were real
they wouldnt be
scary at all right
we would just smile
and say hi ghosts
hi ghosts
laughs softly
hi ghost
wouldnt that be cool
if when someone
wasnt there anymore
there was still a
little piece of them
that could surprise
you sometimes

scary about ghosts

that feels like it

texas has a pull doesnt it
kinda gets under your skin
hundred percent
why dont you turn
that thing on
got a story for you
fellas
fireworks popping
first drug law in the united
states passed in 1875
the chinese rail workers
brought in the opium den
mm
and this country was
so antiimmigrant
that they banned the opium den
not the opium
hmm
chuckles right
you ever hear anything
more american than that
i mean now we got
an opium epidemic
breaking out across
the heartland
with all the ceremony
majesty glamour
and funs removed
andand thats what
people yearn for
you see what im saying
do you think gary webb
wouldve won a pulitzer today
you know i think you were
smart for staying here
ben yeah
yeah
that story about
abilene its nice
i think you were meant
to tell a bigger story
ask yourself what part
of the country today
is it in certain
peoples interest
to keep devastated demoralized
dependent and divided
you got the opioid crisis
nation in divide civic unrest
why are all these things
happening at the same time
what do you really
think is going on here
fireworks continue
popping in distance
told you i had a story for you
woman laughs quietly
ben so what are you saying
that it all connects
that the conspiracy
theories are true
quentin what im saying is
people can sense the truth
but theyre grasping
for the facts
see a myth is just a
truth without facts
thats why it comes out
all abstract gnarled
wrong
easy to dismiss and ridicule
nobody listens to them
because they dont
have the facts
but i do
and you ben
yeah
whispers the whole damn
world will listen to you
rustling
where are they going
afterparty
the afterparty
tell me about that
i mean people overdose a
hundred times a day ben
thats a fact
but they cant do it in a
place where its gonna be
a problem for people
like you and i hmm
thats what happened to abilene
abilene
i mean she died at
a party like this
i thought you
finished that story
oh laughs softly
this is just for us
well its not a very
good story anyway
oh she was a drug addict
she odd
then she tried to call 911
oh in texas we dont call 911
yeah ive heard that
they record all those calls
we gotta be very careful
about what gets recorded
yeah you do
its all thats left of us
the recordings
and people like
you and i abilene
everybody posting photos
of every part of their day
we trade in our entire lives
for the tiny pieces
that get recorded of us
abilene tried to call 911
you didnt let her then what
fireworks whistle pop loudly
oh boy
dont get distracted
you gotta admit thats
a hell of a distraction
laughs that is
thats kind of like
the very definition
of distraction
abilene
abilene
abilene
deep voice  abilene
what happened to abilene
do you believe in ghosts ben
i got a call from
a ghost earlier
kind of thought id
be seeing you today
what happened to her
why do you care so much
why do you care so little
fireworks popping
she overdosed
instead of helping her
you dragged her
to the afterparty
which is a spot with
no cell reception
at the exact intersection
of four overlapping
law jurisdictions
where you knew her death
would just become an
anonymous statistic
hmm
its well said
very succinct
yes thats exactly
what happened
quentin laughs softly
brilliant
you got it
you got it all
thats a story about america
let me know if you need
me to rerecord anything
or like rephrase things
i can do that too
what
oh come
you and i are gonna
be sitting on a panel
talking about this i
want it to be great
we both know how
this works right
yeah ii mean at first
everyones gonna think
you got your bad guy
nobodys gonna let
it be that simple
everyones gonna have
to have their take
cause thats how it works now
everyone has a take
see if you dont have a
take you dont have a voice
if you dont have a
voice you dont exist
so yeah at first
everyones gonna blame me
but then someones gonna
say wait a second
theres a big difference
between leaving somebody to die
and killing somebody
then theyre gonna turn to you
what were you doing
here in the first place
what was your
relationship with her
why would you exploit
her grieving family
laughing those
those characters
i mean i mean thats
what theyre gonna be
famous characters
not famous people
and then theyre gonna
blame the family
oh i hope theyre
ready for that
theyll blame the president
the last president
sputtering
and then theyll start in
with the conspiracy theories
you know and someone will
refute the conspiracy theories
and then one side will make
their version like their cause
and the other side will
take the other side
just to take the other
side and on and on
until your story proves
the defining truth of our time
which is what
everything means everything
so nothing means anything
american by lana
del rey playing
some things mean something
yeah
like what
abilene
scoffs you didnt
care about her
you came here for yourself
fireworks popping
for recording
and then you heard her music
and you saw her photos

just inspirations
for the record of ourselves
you and i both know it
