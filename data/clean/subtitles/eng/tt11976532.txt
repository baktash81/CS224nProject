ben  i figured it out 
eloise  figured what out 
america 
 laughing  okay 
i know you re laughing 
but i have a pitch
you re really gonna like 
america is divided 
but it s not for the
reason that we think 
we think that america s
divided by geography 
red state  blue
state  city  country 
we re missing something
far more profound 
america isn t divided by space 
america is divided by time 
 we don t live in the moment anymore 
 mm 
and why would we  when
we can live in any moment
that s ever been recorded 
and when we experience
something we really love 
our overwhelming instinct
is to somehow file
it away for later 
that s interesting 
we don t watch movies
in the theater 
we don t watch tv when it airs 
we don t even have
conversations at the same time
because we text 
and when you text 
i can say   hi  
and you could say
 hi  back in a second 
  or a minute 
  or never 
or never  cause it s you
and you re too busy producing
the biggest podcast in america 
which is kind of my point
because we re all living
in our own individualized times 
that s why we re living
in divided times 
that s    i like that  ooh 
  you like that 
  yeah 
so  what do you think  do
you think that s a story 
it s a theory 
  a theory is a story 
  no  a theory is not a story 
yes  it is when
it s about an idea 
and america is an idea 
that s what makes it so great 
  so  if you re   
  no  america is its people 
that s what makes
it so fucked up 
hey  not every white
guy in new york
  needs to have a podcast 
   chuckling 
you have the
verified check mark 
you got the new yorker position 
i want something more 
i don t just want
to be a writer 
i    i want to be a voice 
as dorky as it sounds 
i care about america 
and not in that faded
lana del rey way 
and now i see it falling apart 
and we re just
standing in the corner 
like  making fun
of it  you know 
i d like to try to tell
some story that    connects 
okay  okay  well  then   
let me help you connect 
with all your ideas
about america   
even if they re good  right 
you gotta put  em in a story
 cause americans
listen to stories 
 cause americans are people 
they re not    ideas 
  you re you re here 
  yeah 
you need to be here 
does that make sense

i got a couple theories 
cartels  mexican gangbanger

just the beginning 
it goes deep 
and what s this based on 
gut 
right  what s
behind that though 
ain t nothing behind gut 
gut s behind everything
else  otherwise  who are you 
i really think this is
something for the police 
yeah  you talk about the police
like it s just the
same everywhere 
like the police
is  um  mcdonald s
and justice is an egg mcmuffin 
we don t have the police 
we got mike and dan 
you and me  we were
the men in her life 
and they fucked with
the wrong two guys 
okay  um   
so  as  like  a
personal boundary 
like  everybody s different 
some people don t
eat certain foods 
you know  everybody   
  i don t avenge deaths 
  mm hmm 
it s just who i am 
i    you know  i don t live
in a liam neeson movie 
but you kind of look like a guy
from a liam neeson movie though 
okay 
which one am i thinking about 
it it was a train

  it was just on tv 
  i don t know 
schindler s list  oh  my god

those guys in that movie

huge downer

oh  yes  sir  we both are 
and you have a lot of anger

abby s death with me 
oh  what a story that would be 
 ringtone playing 
is this a pocket dial 
ben  i have a story 
  can it wait 
  no 
i m in texas  i m on my
way back from a funeral 
oh  my god  i m so sorry 
it s okay  it s not
someone i was close to 
but you flew to texas for it 
uh  yes 
uh  it was a girl i hooked
up with a few times 
you flew to texas
to attend the funeral
of a random hookup 
her family thought that we
were more serious than i did 
do you know what 
this is a story 
  yeah 
  yeah 
it s you 
the the    your
whole way of life 
it s dating  it s
hookup culture 
how it enables disconnectedness 
  the selfishness 
  no 
  the emptiness 
  no 
  the hollowness 
  that s not what i meant 
the lack of self awareness 
okay  that s not
what i m pitching 
it s really how
sad your life is 
okay  now you re
fucking with me 
listen  i m in west texas
where this family just
lost their daughter
to an opioid overdose 
that is sad but common 
except  her brother won t
accept it s an overdose 
he says it was a murder 
based on what 
nothing 
and that s the story 
this is an existential
crime story 
this is in cold blood 
but there are no killers 
this is about a new
american reality
that people can t accept 
so instead  they invent
these myths and conspiracies
so they can cast themselves
as heroes because   
the truth is too hard to accept 
the death of abilene is about
the death of american identity
and the need to find
someone to blame for it 
this isn t just a
story about vengeance 
it s a story about the
need for vengeance 
the meaning of vengeance

of the school system 
  the government

it s the breakdown of the family
and tradition 
oh  there s a whole lot
of people responsible
  for what happened to abilene 
  sharon  that s true 
  yes  ma am 
  paris  amen 
i think that s very wise 
you re gonna need a
12 gauge  couple of ars 
  no   yep 
  a wesson automatic 
  no  no  no 
  and a sidearm for safety 
  yep  exactly 
  we re not doing that 
granny  oh  we re not  yeah 
i didn t think
you had the balls 
are you gonna help us  ben 
you know  um   
 ben clears throat 
there s some things i m good at 
i m good at asking
the right questions 
i m good at getting
people to talk 
and i m especially good at
drawing thematic connections
between seemingly
disparate elements
and using that to illustrate
a larger point or theory 
so  whoever or whatever
is responsible for what
happened to abilene 
i will find this person
or this generalized
societal force 
and i will define it 
i ll define it 
bless your heart 
i guess we have
a guest room now 
ty 
well  rest up good 
we ll meet in the morning
and start to solve this

white  mexicans 
crawl  you really want
to avenge her with him 
i m like a brother to you

welcome to texas 
you are here 
 imitates gunshot 
ben  morning  kc 
hey 
uh  would you like some coffee 
  sure 
  how do you take it 
in the mouth 
ben  all right 
tell me something
that you love about
where you live 
  whataburger 
  whoo 
  oh   yeah 
  ben  okay  great 
um  tell me about it 
  you want to go right now 
  yeah  let s go 
  ben  uh    uh   
  i m ready 
 you want   
 just  no  just  uh  tell me about it 
you re gonna love
whataburger  ben 
  oh  it s the best 
  what makes it the best 
wherever you are 
there s a whataburger 
yeah  it s always right there 
okay  and then
when you get there 
what do you like about
it  what do you get 
  whatever you want 
  it s always right there 
you could order
whatever you want  ben 
right  but there are a
lot of places like that 
so  let s say  clears throat 
there is a mcdonald s 
a burger king  a sonic
and a whataburger
all lined up 
which one do you go to 
all  whataburger 
right  right  why 
all  because it s right there 
yes  but they re
all right there 
in this scenario 
they re all right there 
so  what do you get
out of whataburger 
what makes it better to you 
  what are you getting   
  ben 
asking why you love whataburger
is like asking why
you love christmas
or a summer night or
why you love your dog 
i mean  you could
point to the reasons 
but the reasons aren t
really the point 
you just love it  and
that s how love works 
ben  i m on my way to get
what could be some
good local color 
it s the place abilene
recorded some demos 
i m heading towards the
quentin sellers music factory 
a place in marfa  the
arts town  where   
people pursue their
dreams of musical stardom 
his motto is  making dreams
come true since 2018  
eloise  if you have  um    if
you can play a clip of that 
um  rebecca black
song   friday  
that would be really funny here 
i bet it s cheap to play 
girl    yeah  yeah  
 vocalizing 
  yeah  
 vocalizing 
 continues vocalizing 
  yeah  
 vocalizing 
 continues vocalizing 
 clicks button 
  quentin  okay 
   vocalizing stops 
  hi 
  hi 
what is music 
like  singing and stuff 
yeah  that s right 
let s take a step back 
i want to share
an idea with you 
there s no argument
more profound
than how the universe
came into existence 
   quietly   oh  god 
  are we here because of god
or science 
i mean  it is  by
its very nature 
the most fundamental question 
but there s one thing
that everyone agrees on 
and that is whether
it was god declaring 
 let there be light  
or an infinite
particle of energy
bursting forth in the big bang 
everyone 
and i mean everyone 
agrees that the universe
started with a sound 
why do i call myself
a record producer 
  i don t know 
   quentin chuckles 
yeah  i mean  we don t
even make records anymore 
 chuckles quietly 
what we re recording
here isn t your record 
it s your sound   
on the record that started
with the very first
moment in time 
so when you sing this song   
i want you to think about
how what you re making
is the record of your
time here on this earth 
it s the sound that you scratch
with your life   
on the record of the universe 
  okay 
  okay 
   button clicks 
   gentle beat begins 
  i finished my
shift at claire s  
  climbed up those
steep mall stairs  
  and the pain of
having nowhere to go  
  pierced the skin of my soul  
  as i sat on the steps  
  and waited and waited  
  for no one to take me home   
yeah 
thank you 
quentin  i call this
place the factory 
 you know  after andy warhol s factory 
 hmm 
most people around here
think it s a reference
to c c music factory 
which  honestly  i i think
warhol would ve loved  but   
yeah  actually  yeah 
i m from out here 
i went to college in new haven 
ben  oh  i went to
school in boston 
quentin  yeah  i thought
about staying there 
but this is the place that
needs something like this 
the problem isn t that
people aren t smart 
the problem is that they are 
if the landscape is like this 
a and people were just boring 
you wouldn t have this problem 
the problem is  you get all
these bright  creative lights
and nowhere to plug
in their energy 
and so it gets channeled
into conspiracy theories
and drugs and violence 
who are your favorite
music artists right now 
ben   exhales  um   
  quentin  can i take a guess 
  yeah 
quentin  you re
a playlist guy 
ben  what does that mean 
quentin  when some computer
recommends you a bunch of songs
based on your favorites 
and a bunch more
 based on your favorites of those 
 right 
so you re listening to
a bunch of music that 
  i mean  you genuinely like   
  yeah 
but you have no
idea who sings it 
now  these playlists  it s
like the dating app for music 
you re not hearing
other people s voices 
you re just hearing your
voice get played back at you 
how are you supposed
to fall in love 
art used to be in charge of us 
you used to buy a whole album
not even knowing what
songs would be on it 
now we have
everything on demand 
at your fingertips 
in pieces 
you think half the people
that are posting quotes
from oscar wilde have ever
actually read one of his plays 
no 
or posting photos
of audrey hepburn
have actually seen the
film that it s from 
  no 
  not a chance  right 
what is that about  huh 
it s the same in culture
as it is in archaeology 
when a civilization collapses 
only the tiniest
fragments remain 
but we can build it back again 
how 
make recordings 
real people 
not what people think
that they already know
and want to hear 
real people 
not some generic
stereotype or generic song 
real people 
what s this podcast
about anyway 
well  um  it s about america 
okay 
it s about the myths
that we tell ourselves 
who is it about 
all of us 
every story we tell is
ultimately about a person 
abilene shaw 
abilene 
yeah 
you re making a
podcast about abilene 
well  it s a little
about abilene 
 i m trying to make it more about   
 no 
it s about abilene 
the person 
that s all you need 
what did you think
about her music 
i haven t really heard it 
shut the front door 
  i mean  i have   
  whoa  whoa  whoa  hold on

here it is 
everything we ever recorded 
  ben  thank you so much 
  you re in for a treat 
doesn t she have a sister
who wants to be a singer 
ben  wants to be famous 
quentin  means she
knows she s somebody 
just doesn t know who yet 
she needs to find her voice 
what about my voice 
i ll put you in the studio 
what do you want to do 
i i  you know   
if i came here for advice
about my voice  my   
you know  my
writing  my podcast 
what would you tell me 
i d probably say that
nobody writes anything 
all we do is translate 
so if you ever get stuck and
you don t know what to say   
just listen 
even to the silences 
listen as hard as you can to
the world around you and   
repeat back what you hear 
that translation 
that s your voice 
 chuckles 
i gotta say  this
is not anything
like what i expected to find 
you came here to make
fun of me  didn t you 
  no  no  no 
  no  i get it s   
it s    i get it

vengeance is a
unique phenomenon 
ty  whispers   texas
invented vengeance 
ben  it makes no sense
if you think about it 
every other primal
human instinct
leads to a clear
evolutionary reward 
but vengeance is different 
it s not about the future 
it s only about the past 
ty  when that massacre
happened  we didn t retreat 
we didn t say   let s all make
sure we don t get mexiphobia  
we said   remember the alamo  
ben  it s not about hope 
it s about regret 
sharon  over headphones   abby
was always creatively minded

with her sisters 
music  of course 
oh  she had such
a beautiful voice 
i really wish more
people could ve heard it 
granny  you re a writer 
anything i d know

the desperation that

intelligence or creativity

paris  we re not
really a gun family 
we have a few rifles
for shooting targets 
a couple handguns
for safety  and   
  and that doesn t concern you 
  why would it concern me 
there s this playwright 
anton chekhov 
and he says that if there s
a gun in act one of a play   
there s no guns in any one
of his plays i can think of 
cherry orchard  no 
uncle vanya  no 
i m not actually that
familiar with his plays 
uh  i m more familiar
with his theory 
but the stakes of these
feelings aren t hypothetical 
they re all too real

do you see my phone 
how it s  like  cracked 
yeah 
it makes me look
the way that i feel 
  um   
   door creaks closed 
 snoring softly 
mike  where do
i know you from 
rodeo 
   snaps fingers 
  it s the longhorns fan 
indeed it is 
mike  indeed it is 
actually  that was
a misunderstanding 
i m sorry  i m not
even a football fan 
um  i was just trying to fit in 
funny way to fit in around here 
point taken 
i didn t know there was
gonna be another team 
i was cheering for texas 
um   
i d love to ask you
a couple questions
about the death of abilene shaw 
  od d 
  accident 
i know that was the
official report 
i was wondering  were you
able to talk to anyone
who was there the
night she died 
you ever go to a party
out by the pump jacks 
everybody goes and
nobody was there 
i wasn t there 
 whispers   i wasn t there 
 both laughing 
why are you so
interested anyway 
you her  uh  boyfriend
or something 
uh  we hung out 
yeah  yeah  i was her boyfriend 
well  you know  90  of the time
it s the boyfriend who did it 
okay  i wasn t    i wasn t
really her boyfriend 
his story s starting to
sound a little inconsistent 
 sighs heavily   swiss cheese 
yeah  um  i m not trying
to cause any problems here 
i m really just trying
to help the family 
you know  this isn t even
our jurisdiction anyways 
 dan sighs 
party happened
outside city limits 
  mm 
  that s county  not city 
  county sheriff 
  sheriff ll talk 
sheriff s a politician 
 laughs  ain t that a fact 
i d love to help you  son  but
our policy is we can t comment
on our process or cases 
well  i was interviewing
people for a podcast
that could be heard
by millions of people 
but i guess that s
not a possibility 
sheriff  these are oxy sticks 
see how the pills
are squared off 
that way  they can pack
 em in boxes to the corners
  without wasting any space 
  mm hmm 
that s how big this business is 
we don t know who s shipping it 
all we know is they re
coming along the interstate
right along the border 
and that route cuts
right by the oil field
where the party was 
sheriff  the most common
overdose spot in the county 
we call it  the afterparty  
very common thing  sad to say 
ben  what s this right here 
looks like two pairs of prints 
cowboy boots 
calling out an apb to find
two men wearing cowboy boots 
 laughter 
 okay 
 man  over radio   what the fuck 
stand down 
son  i wish you
well  i really do 
and bless your little heart 
but this ain t even our
jurisdiction  though 
  it s not 
  no  sir 
this was along the highway 
you want to talk
to highway patrol 
well  ain t that just like a
sheriff to puff his hot air
and blow you straight
into my office 
if there s a drug
overdose at a party
in some fucking field off 29 
i m sorry  but we
got shit to do 
we re not a bunch
of army rejects
just gazing at the rio grande 
  i never said that you were 
  i wasn t talking about us 
oh  is that what they told
you over at highway patrol 
well  you can go
tell junior brown
and the rest of them
glorified meter maids
that if they spent more
time with their real guns
and less with their radar guns 
we might not have to chase
the goddamn texas syndicate
up and down the trans pecos 
got it 
yes  if i find a natural way
to work that into the
conversation with them 
i will do that 
  drt 
  drt 
  drt 
  dead right there 
ben  over phone   law
enforcement was no help at all 
you re learning a lot
down there  aren t you 
the murder or overdose
happened where a lot
of these things happen 
at the intersection of four
overlapping jurisdictions 
so they all kicked
it to each other 
what are the odds 
eloise  what are the odds 
okay  i m gonna kick this around
with the team for a little
bit  shake up the boggle board 
and then i m gonna hit up
robin to get her thoughts 
ben  all right  thanks 
eloise  thanks  everybody 
  bye  ben 
  bye  ben 
 sighs 
um  you re probably not
even gonna watch this 
but i m back home in
texas  and i m bored 
this is my little
brother  mason 
   snoring 
  he sleeps on my floor
because he s afraid of ghosts 
and i tried to tell him
there s no such thing
as ghosts  but whatever 
it keeps him close to me 
so i guess it s not
all bad being here 
that s  um   
well  that s it 
 el stupido snoring softly 
mason 
yes  sir 
just saying good night 
you woke me up just
to say good night 
yes  sir 
 sighs heavily 
i love you mucho 
ty  collective consciousness 
ben  if everyone believes
the same thing   
but without any
facts to support it 
do we listen to that
intuition or dismiss it 
ty  an overdose 
girl never took so much
as an advil in her life 
crawl  she never touched
so much as an advil 
mike  you ever go to a
party out by the pump jacks 
everybody goes  nobody went 
dan and mike  i wasn t there 
 laughing 
quentin  the problem is
you get all these bright 
creative lights and nowhere
to plug in their energy 
and so it gets channeled
into conspiracy theories
and drugs and violence 
ben  i came here to find
out why people in grief
would choose to believe a myth 
crawl  i don t know shit
about how this all connects 
but you bet your ass it does 
ms 13  la línea 
ben  yeah  i m
familiar with la línea 
they actually murdered
41 journalists last year 
crawl  oh  they ve
done bad things  too 
 ty laughing 
ben  but now i find
myself wondering
how much truth might be
embedded in that intuition 
you don t happen to know
her phone password  do you 
took it to every geek
squad in the state 
it s impossible to crack 
  this ain t us 
  you got the wrong department 
  highway patrol   mike and dan 
  border patrol 
  sheriff s department 
  you want county 
ben  everything s
bigger in texas

you re clearly in danger 
and you ve already got
everything you need 
well  i didn t solve the murder 
it s better this way 
you know  an ambiguous
ending without resolution 
that s    that s the secret
weapon with a story like this 
it gnaws at you 
it haunts you forever 
you never let it go 
ben  no  there s
more to it  eloise 
i i m getting so close 
eloise  as much as
we d love to see you
  blown up for a story   
  no  no 
my conscience tells me
i have to choose a
person over a story 
no 
no  no 
otherwise  it would take 
like  two years of therapy
to justify it  and   
i can t afford that on my plan 
look  you re gonna
be huge from this 
okay 
come home 
 phone beeping 
 breathes deeply 
  you remember 
  sharon  hey  you 
hey  sorry about that 
el stupido  who was that 
friend 
was it equinox girl cute 
or was it natalie bumble 
uh  it was  uh  my
podcast producer 
uh  and everything s on track 
you re very sweet to ask 
i love you mucho 
we re so lucky
you found abilene 
i really don t know
what she saw in me 
sharon  i do 
i get it  i totally get it 
  heart sees heart 
  oh   laughs softly 
you know  when i came down here
to spend time with abby s   
 crazy texan family   right 
 laughs   yeah 
uh  i never thought
it would be like this 
people can surprise you 
yeah 
like abilene 
i mean  she was
full of surprises 
  like abilene 
  mm hmm 
great reputation  but
a huge pill popper 
what 
what d you just say 
mm  put that in
your podcast  maybe 
where d you hear that 
the girls told me 
ty told us not to say anything 
are you fucking serious 
i thought you wouldn t
do this with me
if you knew that she was using 
you think 
drugs was something abilene did 
it s not who she was 
but it is how she died 
which is what we
were investigating 
i thought there
was more to this 
i thought that you and i
would get to know each other 
and that would be cool 
i    maybe it was part
of the grieving process 
denial 
isn t that one of the
12 steps of grief 
it s five stages of grief 
12 steps to recovery 
but i understand
that everyone here
is more familiar
with the latter 
it s complicated 
it s not  it s
actually very simple 
everything here is
actually really simple 
and maybe that s why
it took me so long
to understand it 
well  i was following my heart 
and that s what
we do around here 
you follow your heart 
yeah 
well  maybe it s
time to look around
and ask yourselves how
that s working out for you 
maybe you should try following
your brain for a change 
because when you
follow your heart 
the earth is flat 
climate change is a hoax 
vaccines contain microchips 
and mexican drug dealers
killed your sister 
you invent these insane
fucking narratives
to explain why your
lives are such shit shows
because the truth is too
scary for you to face 
which is that you
did it to yourselves 
do you know what people say
about you guys where i m from 
  let me guess  bad things 
  no  worse 
we say good things 
 we took them seriously
when we should ve
taken them literally  
you re neither 
you re not serious people 
and maybe it s time for you all
to take us seriously
and literally
because where i m from
is fun and interesting 
and the people are
rich and diverse 
and  meanwhile  your
town looks like this 
bless your heart 
oh  and i know what that means 
so you know what 
bless your heart 
bless your heart 
bless all your hearts 
all your hearts can
go bless themselves 
who are you to talk to us 
i had to drag you to
her fucking funeral 
 scoffs  who are you 
if your car would ve
blown up in brooklyn 
would anyone    anyone
come to help you 
first of all  i wouldn t have
needed a car in brooklyn 
second  if i had one  i doubt
it would ve been blown up
by god knows who 
i don t understand you people 
 you people  is a
microaggression 
my apologies  y all 
 y all  is a cultural
appropriation 
 chuckles   paris   
you accusing someone of
cultural appropriation
is cultural appropriation 
why wouldn t you look after her 
check in on her 
you wouldn t do anything
for her  would you 
that s right  i wouldn t 
i was hooking up with
different people 
and i assumed she was  too 
because i live in
the real world 
and that s what everybody does 
i tried to tell you
this when you called 
she wasn t my girlfriend 
she was just a girl in my phone 
 grunts 
 ben coughing 
 coughs 
now you ve been in a fight 
 ben coughs 
i don t know the whole story   
but life is complicated 
even around here  if
you can believe that 
i ll tell you what i think 
i think people don t
do drugs for no reason 
they do drugs because
they re in pain 
pain like   
like maybe caring for someone
who hardly knows your name 
so  i don t know  ben 
but if you re still looking
for someone to blame
for what happened   
you may not have needed
to come all this way 
bless your heart 
 truck belt squealing 
   coughs 
   car door closes 
 engine starting 
 dog barking in distance 
 vehicle driving away 
 sighs heavily 
ben  you were right  eloise 
i was the story 
a self absorbed know it all
thinks he s gonna figure
out the meaning of america 
and all he learns
is how empty he is 
i was the one living a myth 
they say you regret the
things you don t do 
i didn t love 
i have no story 
i guess that s the story 
i am the story  and
the story sucks 
the story is nothing 
i m coming home 
 beeps 
 sighs 
el stupido  i m scared 
ben  what are you scared of 
el stupido  ghosts 
ghosts aren t real 
if they re not real  how come
everyone knows what they are 
they re real as an idea 
but they re not real  real 
that s what s scary about
ghosts  that they aren t real 
if ghosts were real 
they wouldn t be
scary at all  right 
we would just smile
and say   hi  ghosts  
hi  ghosts 
 laughs softly 
hi  ghost 
wouldn t that be cool 
if when someone
wasn t there anymore 
there was still a
little piece of them
that could surprise
you sometimes 
yeah 
but there s not 
there s nothing 
and that s what s
scary about ghosts 
that the little piece of someone
that feels like it
might still be there
isn t there at all 
do you feel better 
no 
me neither 
thanks for listening 
i m leaving tomorrow  mason 
i love you mucho 
1 4 3 5 
what 
1 4 3 5 
it s what abby
used to say to me 
she used to say 
 i love you mucho  
but then she shortened it 
so it was kind of
like a secret code
 cause that s the
number of letters
in  i love you mucho  
el stupido  1 4 3 5 
 keys clicking 
 line ringing 
 ringing continues 
 ringtone playing

mason s your fucking brother

look who it is 
  my friend 
  quentin  look at you  bud 
how you doing 
how s that podcast coming 
i sent it in last night 
you re still here 
still here 
texas has a pull  doesn t it 
kinda gets under your skin 
hundred percent 
why don t you turn
that thing on 
got a story for you 
fellas 
 fireworks popping 
first drug law in the united
states passed in 1875 
the chinese rail workers
  brought in the opium den 
  mm 
and this country was
so anti immigrant
that they banned the opium den 
  not the opium 
  hmm 
 chuckles   right 
you ever hear anything
more american than that 
i mean  now we got
an opium epidemic
breaking out across
the heartland
with all the ceremony 
majesty  glamour
and fun s removed 
and and that s what
people yearn for 
you see what i m saying 
do you think gary webb
would ve won a pulitzer today 
you know  i think you were
smart for staying here 
  ben  yeah 
  yeah 
that story about
abilene  it s nice 
i think you were meant
to tell a bigger story 
ask yourself  what part
of the country today
is it in certain
people s interest
to keep devastated  demoralized 
dependent and divided 
you got the opioid crisis 
nation in divide  civic unrest 
why are all these things
happening at the same time 
what do you really
think is going on here 
 fireworks continue
popping in distance 
told you i had a story for you 
 woman laughs quietly 
ben  so what are you saying 
that it all connects 
that the conspiracy
theories are true 
quentin  what i m saying is
people can sense the truth 
but they re grasping
for the facts 
see  a myth is just a
truth without facts 
that s why it comes out
all abstract  gnarled 
wrong 
easy to dismiss and ridicule 
nobody listens to them
because they don t
have the facts 
but i do 
and you  ben   
yeah 
 whispers   the whole damn
world will listen to you 
 rustling 
where are they going 
afterparty 
the afterparty 
tell me about that 
i mean  people overdose a
hundred times a day  ben 
that s a fact 
but they can t do it in a
place where it s gonna be
a problem for people
like you and i  hmm 
that s what happened to abilene 
abilene 
i mean  she died at
a party like this 
i thought you
finished that story 
oh   laughs softly 
this is just for us 
well  it s not a very
good story anyway 
oh  she was a drug addict 
she od d 
then she tried to call 911 
oh  in texas  we don t call 911 
yeah  i ve heard that 
they record all those calls 
we gotta be very careful
about what gets recorded 
yeah  you do 
it s all that s left of us 
the recordings 
and people like
you and i  abilene 
everybody posting photos
of every part of their day 
we trade in our entire lives
for the tiny pieces
that get recorded of us 
abilene tried to call 911 
you didn t let her  then what 
 fireworks whistle  pop loudly 
oh  boy 
don t get distracted 
you gotta admit  that s
a hell of a distraction 
 laughs  that is   
that s kind of like
the very definition
of distraction 
  abilene 
    abilene   
  abilene 
   deep voice     abilene   
what happened to abilene 
do you believe in ghosts  ben 
i got a call from
a ghost earlier 
kind of thought i d
be seeing you today 
what happened to her 
why do you care so much 
why do you care so little 
 fireworks popping 
she overdosed 
instead of helping her 
you dragged her
to the afterparty 
which is a spot with
no cell reception
at the exact intersection
of four overlapping
law jurisdictions
where you knew her death
would just become an
anonymous statistic 
hmm 
it s well said 
very succinct 
yes  that s exactly
what happened 
 quentin laughs softly 
brilliant 
you got it 
you got it all 
that s a story about america 
let me know if you need
me to rerecord anything 
or  like  rephrase things 
i can do that  too 
what 
oh  come   
you and i are gonna
be sitting on a panel
talking about this  i
want it to be great 
we both know how
this works  right 
yeah  i i mean  at first 
everyone s gonna think
you got your bad guy 
nobody s gonna let
it be that simple 
everyone s gonna have
to have their take
 cause that s how it works now 
everyone has a take 
see  if you don t have a
take  you don t have a voice 
if you don t have a
voice  you don t exist 
so yeah  at first 
everyone s gonna blame me 
but then someone s gonna
say   wait a second  
there s a big difference
between leaving somebody to die
and killing somebody 
then they re gonna turn to you 
what were you doing
here in the first place 
what was your
relationship with her 
why would you exploit
her grieving family 
 laughing   those   
those characters 
i mean    i mean  that s
what they re gonna be 
famous characters 
not famous people 
and then they re gonna
blame the family 
oh  i hope they re
ready for that 
they ll blame the president 
the last president 
 sputtering 
and then they ll start in
