couldnt bear even vague possibility laughed
proved something ive always suspected
vanity happiness
incompatible
whatever may may truth philosophical speculations
fact remains turn make sacrifice

danceny must go
patient little whim enough enough
one reason never remarried despite quite bewildering range offers
determination never ordered around
must therefore ask adopt less marital tone voice
