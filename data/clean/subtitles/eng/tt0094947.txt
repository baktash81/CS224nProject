to the outside world 
very well  i think 
i ve advised her to watch and learn
and be quiet except when spoken to 
so we must see what we can devise
for your amusement 
valmont is here 
you receive him  do you 
yes 
so do you 
monsieur le vicomte de valmont  my child   
whom you very probably don t remember   
except that he is conspicuously charming   
never opens his mouth
without first calculating what damage he can do 
then why do you receive him  maman 
everyone receives him 
  madame 
  vicomte 
what a pleasant surprise 
madame de volanges 
how delightful to see you 
you remember my daughter  cécile 
well  indeed  but who could have foretold
she would flower so gracefully 
i wanted to call on you
before leaving the city 
i m not sure we can allow that 
why should you want to leave 
paris in august  you know   
and it s time i paid a visit on my aunt 
i ve neglected her disgracefully 
madame de rosemonde has been good enough
to invite us to stay at the château 
won t you please give her
our warmest regards 
i shall make a point of it  madame 
i think it s time we took you home 
i m used to being in bed
by 9 at the convent 
so i should hope 
madame 
your aunt 
that s correct 
i thought she d already made arrangements
to leave you all her money 
do you know why i summoned you
here this evening 
i d hoped it might be
for the pleasure of my company 
i need you   
to carry out an heroic enterprise 
you remember when bastide left me 
  yes 
  went off with that fat mistress of yours   
  whose name escapes me 
  yes  yes 
no one has ever done that to me before 
or to you  i suspect 
i was quite relieved to be rid of her  frankly 
no  you weren t 
for some years now 
bastide has been searching for a wife 
he was always unshakably prejudiced
in favor of convent education 
and now he s found the ideal candidate 
cécile volanges 
very good 
and her 60 000 a year 
that must have played some small part
in bastide s calculations 
none whatsoever 
bastide s priority  you see   
is a guaranteed virtue 
i wonder if i m beginning to guess   
what it is you re intending to propose 
bastide is with his regiment in corsica
for the rest of the year 
that should give you plenty of time 
you mean to    
  she s a rosebud 
  you think so 
and he d get back from his honeymoon   
to find himself the laughing stock of paris 
  well    
  yes 
love and revenge 
two of your favorites 
no  i can t 
  what 
  oh really  i can t 
  why not 
  oh  it s too easy 
it is  she s seen nothing 
she knows nothing 
she s bound to be curious 
she d be on her back   
before you d unwrapped
the first bunch of flowers 
any one of a dozen men could manage it 
i have my reputation to think of 
i can see i m going to have
to tell you everything 
  of course you are 
  yes 
my aunt is not on her own
just at the moment 
she has a young friend staying with her 
madame de tourvel 
you can t mean it 
to seduce a woman famous for strict morals   
religious fervor
and the happiness of her marriage    
what could possibly be more prestigious 
i think there s something degrading
about having a husband for a rival 
it s humiliating if you fail 
and commonplace if you succeed 
where is monsieur de tourvel anyway 
presiding over some endless case in burgundy 
i don t think you can hope
for any actual pleasure 
oh  yes 
you see  i have no intention
of breaking down her prejudices 
i want her to believe in god and virtue
and the sanctity of marriage   
and still not be able to stop herself 
i want the excitement of watching her   
betray everything that s most important to her 
surely you understand that 
i thought  betrayal  was your favorite word 
no  no   
 cruelty  
i always think that has a nobler ring to it 
  how is belleroche 
  i m very pleased with him 
and is he your only lover 
yes 
i think you should take another 
i think it most unhealthy  this exclusivity 
  you re not jealous  are you 
  of course i am 
belleroche is completely undeserving 
i thought he was one of your friends 
exactly  so i know what i m talking about 
no  i think you should organize an infidelity 
with me  for example 
you refuse me a simple favor   
then you expect to be indulged 
it s only because it is so simple 
it wouldn t feel like a conquest 
i have to follow my destiny 
i have to be true   
to my profession 
all right  then 
come back when you ve succeeded
with madame de tourvel 
  yes 
  and i will offer you   
a reward 
my love 
but i shall require proof 
certainly 
written proof 
not negotiable 
i don t suppose there s
any possibility of an advance 
goodnight  vicomte 
oh  where have you been 
time has no logic when i m not with you 
an hour is like a century 
i ve told you before 
we shall get on a great deal better   
if you make a concerted effort
not to sound like the latest novel 
it s such a beautiful day 
i believe we ll walk 
yes  my lady 
you didn t take the sacrament today 
no 
may i ask why 
i have this appalling reputation 
as you may know 
yes  i have been warned about you 
you have  by whom 
a friend 
the fact is i ve spent my life
surrounded by immoral people 
i ve allowed myself to be influenced by them   
and sometimes even taken pride
in outshining them 
  and now 
  now   
what i most often feel is unworthiness 
but it is precisely at such moments
that you start to become worthy 
i certainly believe one should
constantly strive to improve oneself 
chevalier   
i don t believe you know my cousin 
madame de volanges 
this is chevalier danceny 
and madame s daughter  cécile 
tell us what we should think of the opera 
it s sublime  don t you find 
monsieur danceny is one
of those rare eccentrics   
who come here to listen to the music 
i do look forward to our next meeting 
charming young man   
penniless  regrettably 
he s one of the finest music teachers in the city 
perhaps you should employ him 
how are you getting on
with madame de tourvel s maid 
to tell you the truth 
it s been a bit boring 
if i wasn t so anxious to keep your lordship abreast 
i d have only bothered the once 
still  what else is there to do
in the country 
it wasn t so much the details
of your intimacy i was after   
it s whether or not she s agreed
to bring me madame de tourvel s letters 
  she won t steal the letters  sir 
  she won t 
you know better than me 
it s easy making them do what they want 
it s getting them to do what you want
that gives you a headache 
and them  as often as not 
i need to know who s writing to her about me 
i shouldn t worry if i was you  sir 
she told julie she didn t believe
you went hunting in the mornings 
she said she was gonna have you followed 
so i d say it was only a matter of time 
that is a terrible noise he s making 
he should get the news back to her
twice as quickly 
i don t think we should make it
too easy for him 
what exactly do you think you re doing 
i am impounding these effects  sir 
has it not been explained to you 
monsieur armand is not well 
i don t make the laws  sir 
i just do what i m told 
everybody has to pay his taxes 
how much does he owe 
  well  uh    
  how much 
fifty six livres 
  pay him 
  yes  my lord 
monsieur armand    
excuse me  you don t know me 
of course i do  monsieur le vicomte 
please  don t get up 
  i have to  they re taking the bed 
  no  not at all 
no one s taking anything 
please  please  please    
me  please  please  sir  please    
just to tide you over  i insist 
me  sir    
fifty six livres to save
an entire family from ruin 
that seems a genuine bargain 
these days  you can find
half a dozen like that   
  any village in the country 
  really 
i must say the family was very well chosen 
solidly respectable   
gratifyingly tearful 
no suspiciously pretty girls  well done 
i do my best for you  sir 
that humble gratitude 
it was most affecting 
certainly brought a tear to my eye 
dijon  that s from her husband 
this must be from that
officious friend of hers 
tell me  where do you and julie meet 
oh  in my room  sir 
  and is she coming tonight 
  afraid so 
i think i may be forced
to burst in on you 
see if blackmail will succeed
any better than bribery 
about 2 00 suit you 
i don t want to embarrass you 
will that give you enough time 
ample  sir 
is this true about monsieur armand 
i don t believe i know anyone of that name 
you may as well own up 
my footman happened to be passing   
when you were in the village this morning 
i don t think you should pay
too much attention to servants  gossip 
it is true  isn t it 
well   
yes  it is 
you dear boy 
come and let me give you a hug 
i can t understand how someone
whose instincts are so generous   
could lead such a dissolute life 
i m afraid you have an exaggerated idea   
both of my generosity
and of my depravity 
if i knew who d given you
such a dire account of me    
since i don t   
let me make a confession 
i m afraid the key to the paradox lies
in a certain weakness of character 
i can t see how so thoughtful an act of charity
could be described as weak 
because it was simply a response   
to a strong new influence in my life 
yours 
you see how weak i am 
i promised myself
i was never going to tell you 
it s just that looking at you    
you needn t worry 
i have no illicit intentions 
i would not dream of insulting you 
but i do love you 
i adore you 
please  help me 
  i rang a number of times 
  didn t hear  sir 
  i require some hot water 
  right away  sir 
don t move 
  azolan    
  sir 
wait for me in my room 
you know i can t condone
this sort of behavior 
i know  sir 
  but you may rely on my discretion 
  thank you  sir 
providing  of course 
that you agree to my price 
no  no  nothing like that 
no  all i want is
to get to see every letter   
that madame de tourvel
has received since her arrival here   
and every letter she writes
from now on 
  but sir  i can t  
  deliver them to azolan by midnight 
for your trouble 
would it be very wrong of me
to answer monsieur danceny s letters 
  in the circumstances  yes 
  in what circumstances 
it s not my place to tell you this  my dear   
if i hadn t become so fond of you    
go on  please 
your marriage has been arranged 
  who is it 
  oh  someone i know slightly 
monsieur le comte de bastide 
  what s he like 
  well    
you don t like him 
oh  it s not that 
he s a man of somewhat erratic judgment 
  and rather serious 
  how old is he 
  thirty six 
  thirty six  he s an old man 
do you know when 
in the new year  i believe 
maybe there s a way to let you
write to monsieur danceny 
oh  madame 
if you were to let me see
both sides of the correspondence   
i could reassure myself 
but i can t show you the letters
i ve already sent him 
i trust you slept well  madame 
i wish i could say that i had 
i thought the least i could hope for
was that you would respect me 
but i do  of course 
you ve offended me deeply 
it s unforgivable 
this confirms everything
i ve been told about you 
i m beginning to think
you may have planned the whole exercise 
i had no idea you were staying here 
not that it would have disturbed me
in the slightest if i had known 
you see  until i met you 
i had only ever experienced desire 
love  never 
  that s enough 
  no  no  you ve made an accusation 
you must allow me the opportunity
to defend myself 
i m not going to deny
that i was aware of your beauty   
but the point is 
this has nothing to do with your beauty 
as i got to know you 
i began to realize   
that beauty was the least
of your qualities 
i became fascinated by your goodness 
i was drawn in by it 
i didn t understand
what was happening to me 
it was only when i began to feel
actual physical pain   
every time you left the room   
that it finally dawned on me 
i was in love 
for the first time in my life
i knew it was hopeless   
but that didn t matter to me 
it s not that i want to have you 
all i want is to deserve you 
tell me what to do 
show me how to behave 
i ll do anything you say 
very well  then 
i would like you to leave this house 
i don t see why that should be necessary 
let s just say you ve spent
your whole life making it necessary 
and if you refuse 
i shall be forced to leave myself 
well then  of course  whatever you say 
thank you 
perhaps i might be so bold
as to ask a favor in return 
i think it would only be
just to let me know   
which of your friends
has blackened my name 
if friends of mine
have warned me against you   
i could hardly reward them with betrayal 
i must say 
you devalue your generous offer   
  if you use it as a bargaining point 
  very well  i withdraw the request 
i hope you won t think i m bargaining
if i ask you to let me write to you 
and pray that you will do me
the kindness of answering my letters 
a correspondence with you is not something
a woman of honor could permit herself 
you re determined to refuse my suggestions 
  i didn t say that 
  and you d rather be unjust   
than risk showing me a touch of kindness 
i would welcome the chance
to prove to you   
that what lies behind this
is not hatred or resentment but  
but what 
listen to this 
 he knows exactly how far
he may venture without risk   
and guarantees his own security   
by tormenting only
the safest kind of victim  women  
madame de volanges 
  goodbye  aunt 
  goodbye  dear boy 
  monsieur  please    
  i ll write soon 
my dear madame de tourvel   
i have just come  
don t move  i said 
  to my desk   
in the middle of a stormy night   
during which   
i have been   
tossed   
from exultation   
to exhaustion   
and back again 
yet  despite these torments   
i guarantee that at this moment   
i am far happier than you 
we ll finish it later  shall we 
your damned cousin  the volanges bitch   
wanted me away from madame de tourvel 
well  now i am  and i intend
to make her suffer for it 
your plan  to ruin her daughter 
are you making any progress 
is there anything i can do to help 
i m entirely at your disposal 
well  yes 
i told danceny you would act
as his confidant and adviser 
i need you to stiffen his resolve 
if that s the phrase 
i thought if anyone could help him  
help  he doesn t need help 
he needs hindrances 
if he has to climb over enough of them 
he might inadvertently fall on top of her 
i take it he hasn t been a great success 
he s been disastrous 
like most intellectuals 
he s intensely stupid 
i often wonder how you managed
to invent yourself 
i had no choice  did i 
i m a woman 
women are obliged to be
far more skillful than men 
you can ruin our reputation and our life
with a few well chosen words 
so  of course 
i had to invent not only myself   
but ways of escape
no one has ever thought of before 
and i ve succeeded because   
i ve always known i was born
to dominate your sex and avenge my own 
yes  but what i ask was  how 
when i came out into society i was 15 
i already knew that the role
i was condemned to   
namely  to keep quiet
and do what i was told   
gave me the perfect opportunity
to listen and observe 
not to what people told me 
which naturally was of no interest   
but to whatever it was
they were trying to hide 
i practiced detachment 
i learned how to look cheerful
while under the table   
i stuck a fork into the back of my hand 
i became   
a virtuoso of deceit 
it wasn t pleasure i was after 
it was knowledge 
i consulted the strictest moralist
to learn how to appear 
philosophers  to find out what to think 
and novelists  to see
what i could get away with 
and in the end i distilled everything
to one wonderfully simple principle   
win or die 
so you re infallible  are you 
if i want a man  i have him 
if he wants to tell 
he finds that he can t 
that s the whole story 
and was that our story 
i wanted you before we d ever met 
my self esteem demanded it 
then when you began to pursue me   
i wanted you so badly 
it s the only time i have ever
been controlled by my desire 
single combat 
madame de volanges 
your note said it was urgent 
it s days now  i haven t been able
to think of anything else 
please  sit down 
i have reason to believe   
that a  
oh  how should i describe it 
that a dangerous liaison
has sprung up between your daughter   
and the chevalier danceny 
oh  no  that s completely absurd 
cécile is still a child 
she understands nothing of these things 
and danceny is an entirely
respectable young man 
tell me   
does cécile have a great many correspondents 
why do you ask 
i went to her room
at the beginning of this week 
i simply knocked on the door and entered 
she was stuffing an envelope   
into the top right hand drawer
of her bureau   
in which i couldn t help noticing   
there seemed to be a large number
of similar letters 
i am most grateful to you 
would you think it impertinent
if i were to make another suggestion 
no  no 
if my recollection is correct   
i overheard you saying
to the vicomte de valmont   
that his aunt invited you and cécile
to stay at her château 
she has  yes  repeatedly 
a spell in the country
might be the very thing 
thank you 
you asked for hindrances 
you are a genuinely wicked woman 
and you wanted a chance
to make my cousin suffer 
  i can t resist you 
  i made it easy for you 
but all this is most inconvenient 
the comtesse de beaulieu
has invited me to stay 
well  you will just have to put her off 
well  the comtesse has promised me
extensive use of her gardens 
it seems her husband s fingers
are not as green as they once were 
maybe not 
but from what i hear 
all his friends are gardeners 
is that so 
you want your revenge 
i want my revenge 
i m afraid there s only one place
you can go 
  back to auntie  eh 
  back to auntie 
where you can also pursue
that other matter 
you have some evidence to procure 
have you not 
don t you think it would be
a generous gesture   
to show the proper confidence
in my abilities   
if we were to take
that evidence for granted 
i need it in writing  vicomte 
  now you must leave me 
  must i  why 
  because i m hungry 
  yes 
i have quite an appetite myself 
then go home and eat 
in writing 
you ll be pleased to hear  my dear 
that armand is on his feet again   
and back at work 
who 
monsieur armand 
whose family you helped so generously 
oh  yes 
when my nephew was last here
we discovered  quite by chance   
  that he had gone into the village  
  are you all right  madame 
i m sorry to interrupt  aunt 
it seemed to me  all of a sudden   
that madame de tourvel
didn t look at all well 
  i m quite all right 
  perhaps some fresh air 
do you feel constricted 
i feel sure madame de volanges is right 
as usual 
a turn around the grounds 
yes  a little walk in the garden 
it s not too cool  i think 
fresh air will do you the world of good 
that meal was somewhat heavy  perhaps 
i can t believe that was the cause 
come back for it 
mademoiselle 
i ve no wish to arouse suspicion 
so i ll be brief 
the letter is from the chevalier danceny 
  yes  i thought  
  now  the handing over of such letters   
is a far from easy matter to accomplish 
i cannot be expected to create
a diversion every day 
so    
this key resembles your bedroom key 
which is kept in your mother s room   
on the mantelpiece 
tied with a blue ribbon 
take it  go attach the blue ribbon   
and put it in the place
of your bedroom key 
bring it to me and i will get a copy
cut within two hours 
i can collect your letters
and deliver danceny s   
without any complications 
now  in the cupboard by your bed   
you ll find a feather
and a small bottle of oil   
so that you may oil the lock and hinges
on the ante room door 
  are you sure  monsieur 
  trust me 
believe me  mademoiselle   
if there s one thing i can t abide 
it s deceitfulness 
i trust you are feeling a little better  madame 
if i were ill  monsieur 
it would not be difficult to guess who was responsible 
you can t mean me  do you 
  you promised to leave here 
  and i did 
would you excuse me  madame 
quick  your mother 
what are you doing 
i just came up to fetch your shawl 
why are you so angry with me 
all i can offer you is my friendship 
can t you accept it 
i could pretend to 
but that would be dishonest 
the man i used to be
would have been content with friendship   
and then set about trying
to turn it to his advantage 
but i have changed now 
i can t conceal from you that
i love you tenderly  passionately   
and above all  respectfully 
so how am i to demote myself
to the tepid position of friend 
not that you re even pretending
to show friendship 
  what do you mean 
  well  is this friendly 
why must you deliberately
destroy my peace of mind 
you were wrong to feel threatened by me  madame 
your happiness is far more important to me
than my own 
that is what i mean
when i say that i love you 
i think we should end this conversation 
i shall leave you in possession of the field 
but look    
we are to be living under the same roof 
at least for a few days 
surely we don t have to try
to avoid each other 
of course not 
provided you adhere to my few simple rules 
i shall obey you in this as in everything 
monsieur    
what 
nothing 
nothing to worry about 
  have you brought a letter 
  no 
then what    
what are you going to tell your mother 
how will you explain the fact
that i have your key 
if i tell her i m here at your invitation   
i have a feeling she ll believe me 
what do you want 
well  i don t know 
  what do you think 
  no 
all right  all right 
i just want you to give me a kiss 
  a kiss 
  that s all 
  then will you go 
  then i ll go 
  promise 
  whatever you say 
all right 
all right 
very nice 
no  i mean  will you go now 
oh  i don t think so 
  but you promised 
  i promised to go when you gave me a kiss 
you didn t give me a kiss 
i gave you a kiss 
not the same thing at all 
and if i give you a kiss    
let s just get ourselves more comfortable 
shall we 
i better see what s wrong 
if you will excuse me 
of course  my dear 
i shouldn t worry  madame 
the young have such
miraculous powers of recuperation 
i m sure she ll soon
be back in the saddle 
who else can i turn to
in my desperation  madame 
and how can i write the necessary words 
there s something going on 
and cécile will not tell me 
you must speak to her at once 
tell me   
you resisted him  did you 
of course i did   
as much as i could 
  but he forced you 
  no   
not exactly 
but i found it almost impossible
to defend myself 
why was that  did he tie you up 
no  no  he just has a way
of putting things 
  you can t think of an answer 
  not even  no  
i kept on saying no all the time 
but somehow 
that wasn t what i was doing 
i am so ashamed 
you ll find the shame is like the pain 
you only feel it once 
you really want my advice 
please 
allow monsieur de valmont   
to continue your instruction 
convince your mother you ve forgotten danceny 
  and raise no objection to the marriage 
  with monsieur de bastide 
when it comes to marriage 
one man is as good as the next 
and even the least accommodating
is less trouble than a mother 
are you saying  i m going to have to do that 
with three different men 
i m saying  you stupid little girl   
that provided you take
a few elementary precautions   
you can do it  or not   
with as many men as you like 
as often as you like   
in as many different ways as you like 
our sex has few enough advantages 
so make the best of those you have 
now  here comes your maman   
so remember what i ve said 
and above all  no sniveling 
how are you feeling now  my dear 
oh  much better  thank you  maman 
i think you look tired 
i think you should go to bed 
  no  i  
  you should do as your mother suggests 
we can arrange to have
something brought to your room 
i m sure it will do you good 
well  perhaps you are right  madame 
you have such a very good influence on her 
i don t think i ve congratulated you
on your revenge 
  so you know 
  oh  yes 
and i believe from now on 
you ll find her door unbolted 
where is she 
i can t see her at the moment 
surely i have explained to you before
how much i enjoy watching the battle   
between love and virtue 
what concerns me is that
you seem to enjoy watching it   
much more than you used to enjoy winning it 
all in good time 
the century is drawing to its close 
isn t it a pity that our agreement   
does not relate to the task
you set me   
rather than the task i set myself 
i am grateful  of course 
but that would have been
almost insultingly simple 
one does not applaud the tenor
for clearing his throat 
as with every other science 
the first thing you must learn   
is to call everything
by its proper name 
i don t see why we have to talk at all 
without the correct polite vocabulary   
how can you indicate
what you would like me to do   
or make an offer of something
i might find agreeable 
  surely you just  
  you see  if i do my work adequately   
i would like to think
you ll be able to   
surprise monsieur de bastide
on his wedding night 
  would he be pleased 
  of course 
he ll merely assume your maman
has done her duty and fully briefed you 
maman couldn t possibly talk
of anything of that sort 
i can t think why 
she was  after all  one of the most
notorious young women in paris 
  maman 
  certainly 
more noted for her enthusiasm
than her ability   
if i remember rightly 
there was a famous occasion
before you were born    
this would have been   
when your mother went to stay
with the comtesse de beaulieu   
who tactfully gave her a room
between your father s   
and that of a monsieur de vressac   
who was her acknowledged lover at the time 
yet  in spite of these careful arrangements   
she contrived to spend the night
with a third party 
  i can t believe that 
  no  no  i assure you  it s true 
how do you know 
the third party was myself 
you asked me if monsieur de bastide
would be pleased with your abilities 
and the answer is   
education is never a waste 
now   
i think we might begin   
with one or two latin terms 
we go for a walk together
almost every day 
a little further every time down the path   
that has no turning 
she has accepted my love   
i have accepted her friendship 
we are both aware of how little there is
to choose between them 
i wish you knew me well enough to recognize   
how much you have changed me 
my friends in paris remarked on it at once 
i have become the soul of consideration   
conscientious  charitable   
more celibate than a monk 
more celibate 
well  you know the stories one hears in paris 
i feel she is inches from surrender 
her eyes are closing 
madame 
where are you going  monsieur 
  to the salon 
  there is no one there 
the others have all decided
on an early night 
  i very much missed our walk today 
  yes 
i fear with the weather as it is 
we can look forward to very few more of them 
  this heavy rain is surely exceptional 
  yes  may i 
of course 
but  you see  within a week
i shall have concluded my business 
  i see 
  even so  i am not sure   
i ll be able to bring myself to leave 
oh  please  you must 
  are you still so anxious to be rid of me 
  you know the answer to that 
i rely on your integrity and generosity 
i want to able to be grateful to you 
forgive me if i say
i don t want your gratitude 
what i want from you
is something altogether deeper 
i know god is punishing me for my pride 
i was so certain this could never happen 
  nothing like what  love 
  i can t 
  is love what you mean 
  you promised not to 
yes  of course  but i must know 
i can t  don t you understand 
it s impossible 
you don t have to speak 
just look at me 
yes 
for god s sake  you must leave me
if you don t want to kill me 
you must help 
fetch madame 
madame de tourvel has been taken ill 
i heard something as i was passing 
she seemed to be having difficulty breathing 
  oh  my dear  whatever is it 
  i m all right now 
i shall leave her in your capable hands  aunt 
we must send for a doctor  my dear 
no  no  please 
i don t need a doctor  i just    
sit with me for a moment 
i must leave this house 
i am most desperately in love 
to leave is the last thing in the world
i want to do  but   
i d rather die
than have to live with the guilt 
my dear girl 
none of this is any surprise to me 
the only thing that might surprise one
is how little the world changes 
what should i do 
what s your advice 
if i remember rightly in such matters   
all advice is useless 
i have never been so unhappy 
i m sorry to say this but   
those who are most worthy of love
are never made happy by it 
but why  why should that be 
do you still think
men love the way we do 
no 
men enjoy the happiness they feel 
we can only enjoy the happiness we give 
they are not capable   
of devoting themselves
exclusively to one person 
so to hope to be made happy by love   
is a certain cause of grief 
i am devoted to my nephew 
but what is true of most men   
is doubly so of him 
and yet   
he could have  just now    
he took pity on me 
if he has released you   
my dear child  you must go 
get up  sir  quick 
sir 
what is it 
over here 
  what is it 
  madame de tourvel 
what 
i want you to follow her  right now 
stay close to her 
i want to know everything 
where she goes  who she sees 
what she eats  if she sleeps 
everything 
that s for bribes  yours will come later 
  yes  sir 
  now  go 
go 
dear father anselme   
try as i may  i cannot see   
the necessity for the interview you suggest 
however  since you insist 
i propose you bring him to see me   
on thursday  the 28th at 6 00 p m 
this is excellent 
make sure father anselme receives it 
what news 
no visitors 
there still hasn t been a single visitor
since she got back 
a bit of soup last night 
didn t touch the pheasant 
afterwards  a cup of tea 
nothing else to report 
oh yes  sir  there is 
you wanted to know what she was reading 
the book by her bed is
christian thoughts   
volume two 
how is julie 
she seems a bit keener
than she was in the country 
and yourself 
talk about devotion to duty 
off you go 
keep it up 
  madame 
  vicomte 
well   
what a pleasant surprise 
danceny 
thank you  monsieur  for everything 
well  i was afraid i d been
a sad disappointment to you 
on the contrary 
it s you i have to thank
for keeping our love alive 
well  as to love 
cécile thinks of little else 
she and her mother are coming back to paris
in two weeks   
and she is longing to see you 
i have had the most wonderful letter from her 
really 
not like any of her other letters  somehow   
quite a different tone of voice 
my dearest   
danceny   
i swear to you    
   on my chastity   
that even if my mother forces me
to go through with this marriage    
comma   i shall be yours completely  
your friend  the vicomte de valmont   
has been very active on your behalf 
i doubt if you could do more yourself 
i don t know how i could bear to go
another two weeks without seeing her 
we shall have to do our very best
to provide some distraction for you 
if you would be so kind
as to wait in the carriage 
there s a matter i must discuss
with the vicomte in private 
of course 
i don t know how i can ever repay you 
don t give it another thought 
it s been delightful 
poor boy  he s quite harmless 
sometimes  vicomte 
i can t help but adore you 
i have a piece of news i hope
you might find entertaining 
i have reason to believe
the next head of the house of bastide   
may be a valmont 
what can you mean 
cécile is two weeks late 
  aren t you pleased 
  i m not sure 
your aim was to revenge yourself on bastide 
i have provided him with a wife trained by me
to perform  quite naturally   
services one would hesitate
to request from a professional   
and very likely pregnant as well 
what more do you want 
all right  vicomte  i agree 
you have more than done your duty 
shame you let the other one
slip through your fingers 
  i let her go 
  but why 
i was moved 
oh  well then  no wonder you bungled it 
i have an appointment
to visit her on thursday   
and this time i shall be merciless 
i am pleased to hear it 
why do you suppose we   
only feel compelled to chase
the ones who run away 
immaturity 
i shan t have a moment s peace
until it s over 
i love her  i hate her   
my life is misery 
well  i think i may have kept our young friend
waiting long enough 
i shall call on you
sometime soon after thursday 
only if you succeed  vicomte 
i can t face another catalogue of incompetence 
  i shall succeed 
  i hope so 
once upon a time you were a man
to be reckoned with 
i understand father anselme   
has explained to you
the reason for my visit 
he said you wished
to be reconciled with me   
before beginning instruction with him 
that s correct 
but i see no need
for formal reconciliation  monsieur 
no  when i have  as you said 
insulted you   
and when you have treated me
with an unqualified contempt 
contempt 
you run away from my aunt s house
in the middle of the night 
you refuse to answer
or even receive my letters 
and all this 
after i have shown a restraint   
of which i think we are both aware 
i would call that 
at the very least  contempt 
you understand me better
than you pretend to  monsieur 
it was me you ran away from  wasn t it 
  i had to leave 
  and do you have to keep away from me 
i am as unhappy as you could
have ever wanted me to be 
i ve only ever wanted your happiness 
how can i be happy without you 
i must have you or die 
death it is 
i m sorry  madame 
all i wanted from this meeting
was your forgiveness   
for the wrongs that you think
that i ve done you 
so that i may end my days
in some peace of mind 
i understood you approved of the choice
my duty has compelled me to make 
yes  and your choice has determined mine 
which is what 
the only choice capable
of putting an end to my suffering 
  what do you mean 
  i love you 
you have no idea how much 
just remember i have made
far more difficult sacrifices   
than the one i m about to make 
now   
  goodbye 
  no 
you must listen to me  no 
why should you be so upset
by the idea of making me happy 
you re right  i cannot live either
unless i make you happy 
so i promise   
no more refusals   
and no more regrets 
success 
well   
i arrived at about 6 
yes  i think you may omit
the details of the seduction 
they re never very enlivening 
just describe the event itself 
  it was unprecedented 
  really 
it had a kind of charm that i don t think
i have experienced before 
once she d surrendered 
she behaved with perfect candor 
total mutual delirium 
which  for the first time ever with me 
outlasted the pleasure itself 
she was astonishing 
so much so  that i ended by falling on my knees
and pledging her eternal love 
and do you know that at that time   
and for several hours afterwards 
i actually meant it 
i see 
it s extraordinary  isn t it 
is it 
  it sounds to me perfectly commonplace 
  oh  no   
i assure you 
but  of course 
the best thing about it is   
i am now in a position
to be able to claim my reward 
you mean to say you persuaded her
to write a letter as well   
in the course of this awesome encounter 
i didn t necessarily think you were going
to be a stickler for formalities 
in any case  i may have to declare
our arrangement null and void 
what do you mean 
i m not accustomed
to be taken for granted 
but there s no question of that 
you re misunderstanding me 
i have no wish to tear you away
from the arms of someone so astonishing 
we ve always been frank with one another 
as a matter of fact 
i ve taken a new lover   
who is proving more than satisfactory 
  who is that 
  i m not in the mood for confidences 
don t let me keep you 
you can t seriously imagine
i prefer her to you 
you may genuinely be unaware of this   
but i can see quite plainly
that you are in love with this woman 
no 
not at all 
have you forgotten what it s like
to make a woman happy 
  and to be made happy yourself 
  i 
  of course not 
  we loved each other once  didn t we 
i think it was love 
and you made me very happy 
and we could again 
we just untied the knot 
it was never broken 
illusions  of course 
are by their nature sweet 
i have no illusions 
i lost them on my travels 
now   
i want to come home 
as for this present infatuation 
it won t last   
but for the moment 
it is beyond my control 
my dear vicomte  i m obliged to go away
for a couple of weeks   
but i m well aware of our arrangement 
on my return you and i
will spend a single night together 
we shall enjoy it enough
to regret it is to be our last 
but then we shall remember that regret
is an essential component of happiness 
all this  of course   
providing you are able
to procure this famous letter 
it shall be done 
but paris is so tedious without you 
and i am living like a medieval hermit 
all right  give me a moment 
drink up 
what is it 
someone who may well
not appreciate your presence 
  do you mean a woman 
  a lady  we might even say 
oh  it s not the one
we wrote that letter to 
  the very one 
  i enjoyed that 
you proved a most talented desk 
  i d like to see what she looks like 
  well  you can t 
on second thought 
i don t see why you shouldn t 
  do you have plans for this evening 
  a few friends round for dinner 
  and after dinner 
  nothing firm 
well    
i ll be there 
this is an unexpected pleasure 
  i know that woman 
  are you sure  i d be surprised 
she s been pointed out to me at the opera 
yes  well  she s striking 
she s a courtesan  isn t she 
yes  i suppose  in a manner of speaking 
well  i m sorry to have disturbed you 
you haven t disturbed me 
i m overjoyed to see you 
you ll never be received
at my house again 
i don t want your lies and excuses 
sit down  just hear me out 
that s all i ask 
then you can judge 
unfortunately  i cannot unlive
the years i lived before i met you 
during those years
i had a wide acquaintance   
the majority of whom were no doubt
undesirable in one respect or another 
now  it may surprise you
to know that emilie   
in common with many others
of her character and profession   
is kind hearted enough
to take an interest   
in those less fortunate than herself 
in short   
she has the time and the inclination
to do a great deal of charity work 
donations to hospitals 
soup for the poor   
protection for animals   
anything which touches
her sentimental heart 
from time to time  i make a small contribution
to her purse  that s all 
is that true 
my relations with emilie   
have been  for some years now 
quite blameless 
i mean  she s even done
a little secretarial work for me on occasion 
  why did she laugh 
  i have no idea 
does she know about me 
no doubt she made what 
in view of my past   
must be regarded as a fair assumption 
i want to believe you 
i knew you were coming up 
you were announced 
i m sorry 
but  no 
no  it s i who must apologize 
it was most insensitive of me 
i didn t think it was possible for me
to love you more 
but your jealousy    
i love you so much 
when will you start writing to me again 
my dear vicomte   
i don t believe this self denial
can be good for you 
i hope it doesn t mean
you re neglecting your little pupil 
but where can danceny be 
i told you  i have all my people out
looking for him 
there s no trace of him 
it is only the wind 
where are you 
there s nothing to be frightened about 
yes  there is 
i m bleeding 
your porter seems to be
under the impression   
that you re still out of town 
i have in fact only just returned 
without attracting the attention
of your porter 
it may be time to review
your domestic arrangements 
i am exhausted 
naturally  i instructed the porter   
to inform any casual callers
that i was out 
and you here as well   
my dear young friend 
the porter appears to be having
a somewhat erratic evening 
oh  well    
yes 
as a matter of fact 
it s you that i m looking for 
is it 
mademoiselle cécile returns to paris
after an absence of over two months 
now  what do you suppose
is uppermost in her mind 
answer  of course  the longed for reunion
with her beloved chevalier 
vicomte  this is no time
to make mischief 
nothing could be further from my mind  madame 
go on 
imagine her distress and alarm
when her loved one is nowhere to be found 
i ve had to do more improvising
than an italian actor 
how is she  is she all right 
oh  yes  well  no  to be quite frank 
i m sorry to tell you she s been ill 
  ill 
  calm yourself  my friend 
the surgeon has declared her
well on the road to recovery 
but you can well imagine how desperate
i ve been to find you 
of course  i    
my god  how could i have been away
at such a time 
how can i ever forgive myself 
but look  all is well now with cécile 
i assure you 
and i shan t disturb you further 
it s only that i have a little something
to show the marquise 
wait in my dressing room 
  it s through there 
  i know where it is 
i see she writes as badly as she dresses 
is it really true the little one s been ill 
not so much an illness 
more a refurbishment 
  what do you mean 
  miscarriage 
oh  vicomte  i am so sorry 
your son and bastide s heir 
isn t there something else
that we should be discussing 
i do hope you re not gonna be difficult
about danceny 
i know belleroche was pretty limp   
but i think you could ve found
a livelier replacement   
  than that mawkish schoolboy 
  mawkish or not  he s completely devoted 
and  i suspect 
better equipped to provide me with   
happiness and pleasure than you are   
in your present mood 
i see 
if i thought you would be
your old charming self   
i might invite you to visit me
one evening next week 
really 
i still love you  you see   
in spite of all your faults
and my complaints 
are you sure you re not going to impose
some new condition   
before you agree to honor your obligation 
i have a friend who became involved
with an entirely unsuitable woman 
whenever any of us pointed this out to him   
he invariably made
the same feeble reply 
 it s beyond my control   he would say 
he was on the verge
of becoming a laughing stock 
at which point  another friend of mine 
a woman   
decided to speak to him seriously 
she explained to him
that his name was in danger   
of being ludicrously associated with this phrase
for the rest of his life 
so do you know what he did 
i feel sure you re about to tell me 
he went round to see his mistress
and bluntly announced he was leaving her 
well  as you can expect 
she protested vociferously 
but to everything she said   
to every objection she made   
he simply replied 
 it s beyond my control  
good night 
you re only five minutes late 
but i get so frightened 
i become convinced
i m never going to see you again 
  my angel 
  is it like that for you too 
yes 
at this moment  for example 
i m quite convinced   
i m never going to see you again 
what 
i m so bored  you see 
it s beyond my control 
what do you mean 
well  after all  it s been four months 
so  what i said 
it s beyond my control 
do you mean you don t love me anymore 
my love had great difficulty
outlasting your virtue 
it s beyond my control 
  it s that woman  isn t it 
  you re quite right 
i have been deceiving you with emilie 
among others 
it s beyond my control 
why are you doing this 
there s a woman 
not emilie  another woman 
a woman i adore 
and i m afraid she s insisting
that i give you up 
it s beyond my control 
liar  liar 
you re quite right  i am a liar 
and it s like your fidelity  a fact of life 
no more nor less irritating 
  certainly beyond my control 
  stop it 
don t keep saying that 
sorry  beyond my control 
why don t you take another lover 
whatever you like 
it s beyond my control 
do you want to kill me 
listen  listen to me 
you have given me great pleasure 
but i simply cannot bring myself
to regret leaving you 
it s the way of the world 
quite beyond my control 
tomorrow morning  early 
yes  my lord 
this is not your appointed night 
  that story you told me  how did it end 
  i m not sure i know what you mean 
once this friend of yours had taken
the advice of his lady friend   
did she take him back 
am i to understand 
the day after our last meeting 
i broke with madame de tourvel   
on the grounds that it was
beyond my control 
  you didn t 
  i certainly did 
but how wonderful of you 
you kept telling me
my reputation was in danger   
but i think this may well turn out
to be my most famous exploit 
i believe it sets a new standard 
only one thing could possibly
bring me greater glory 
what s that 
to win her back 
  you think you could 
  i don t see why not 
i ll tell you why not 
because when one woman strikes
at the heart of another  she seldom misses   
and the wound is invariably fatal 
  is that so 
  oh  yes 
i m also inclined to see this
as one of my greatest triumphs 
there s nothing a woman enjoys so much
as victory over another woman 
except  you see  vicomte 
my victory wasn t over her 
  of course it was  what do you mean 
  it was over you 
you loved that woman  vicomte 
what s more  you still do 
quite desperately 
if you hadn t been so ashamed of it   
how could you have treated her so viciously 
you couldn t bear even the vague possibility
of being laughed at 
and this has proved something
i ve always suspected 
that vanity and happiness   
are incompatible 
whatever may or may not be the truth
of these philosophical speculations   
the fact remains  it is now your turn
to make a sacrifice 
is that so 
  danceny must go 
  where 
i have been more than patient
with this little whim of yours  enough is enough 
one reason i never remarried 
despite a quite bewildering range of offers   
was the determination never again
to be ordered around 
i must therefore ask you to adopt
a less marital tone of voice 
she is ill  you know 
i have made her ill for your sake 
so the least you can do is
get rid of that colorless youth 
haven t you had enough of bullying women
for the time being 
i see i shall have to make myself very plain 
i have come to spend the night 
i shall not take at all kindly
to being turned away 
i am sorry 
i ve made other arrangements 
yes  i knew there was something 
what 
danceny isn t coming  not tonight 
what do you mean 
how do you know 
i know  because i have arranged for him
to spend the night with cécile 
come to think of it 
he mentioned he was expected here 
but when i put it to him
that he would really have to make a choice   
i must say  he didn t hesitate 
he s coming to see you tomorrow to explain 
and to offer you  
do i have this right 
yes  i think i do 
  his eternal friendship 
as you said 
he is entirely devoted to you 
  that s enough  vicomte 
  you re absolutely right 
shall we go up 
shall we what 
go up 
unless you prefer this 
if memory serves  rather purgatorial sofa 
  i think it s time you were leaving 
  no  i don t think so 
we made an arrangement 
i really don t think i can allow myself   
to be taken advantage of
for a moment longer 
remember  i m better at this
than you are 
perhaps  but it is always the best swimmers
who drown 
now  yes or no 
it s up to you  of course 
i will merely confine myself to remarking   
that a no will be regarded
as a declaration of war 
a single word is all that s required 
all right 
war 
my dear chevalier danceny   
i understand you spent last night
with cécile volanges 
i learned this from her
more regular lover   
the vicomte de valmont 
i m dying because
i wouldn t believe you 
fetch the surgeon 
no  no 
do as i say 
a moment of your time 
two things  a word of advice 
which of course you may ignore  but   
it is honestly intended   
and a request 
go on 
the advice is 
be careful of the marquise de merteuil 
you must permit me to treat with skepticism   
anything you have to say about her 
nevertheless  i must tell you   
in this affair 
we are both her creatures   
as i believe
her letters to me will prove 
when you have read them 
you may decide to circulate them 
and the request 
i want you somehow   
somehow   
to get to see madame de tourvel 
i understand she s very ill 
that is why this is most important to me 
i want you to tell her
that i cannot explain   
why i broke with her as i did 
but that since then 
my life has been worth nothing 
i pushed the blade in deeper
than you just have  my boy   
and now i need you
to help me withdraw it 
tell her it is lucky for her
that i have gone   
and i m glad not to have
to live without her 
tell her  her love was the only real happiness
that i have ever known 
will you do that for me 
i will 
it s all very well feeling sorry now 
let him be 
he had good cause 
i don t believe that s something anyone
