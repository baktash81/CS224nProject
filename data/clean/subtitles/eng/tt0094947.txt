to the outside world
very well i think
ive advised her to watch and learn
and be quiet except when spoken to
so we must see what we can devise
for your amusement
valmont is here
you receive him do you
yes
so do you
monsieur le vicomte de valmont my child
whom you very probably dont remember
except that he is conspicuously charming
never opens his mouth
without first calculating what damage he can do
then why do you receive him maman
everyone receives him
madame
vicomte
what a pleasant surprise
madame de volanges
how delightful to see you
you remember my daughter cécile
well indeed but who could have foretold
she would flower so gracefully
i wanted to call on you
before leaving the city
im not sure we can allow that
why should you want to leave
paris in august you know
and its time i paid a visit on my aunt
ive neglected her disgracefully
madame de rosemonde has been good enough
to invite us to stay at the château
wont you please give her
our warmest regards
i shall make a point of it madame
i think its time we took you home
im used to being in bed
by 9 at the convent
so i should hope
madame
your aunt
thats correct
i thought shed already made arrangements
to leave you all her money
do you know why i summoned you
here this evening
id hoped it might be
for the pleasure of my company
i need you
to carry out an heroic enterprise
you remember when bastide left me
yes
went off with that fat mistress of yours
whose name escapes me
yes yes
no one has ever done that to me before
or to you i suspect
i was quite relieved to be rid of her frankly
no you werent
for some years now
bastide has been searching for a wife
he was always unshakably prejudiced
in favor of convent education
and now hes found the ideal candidate
cécile volanges
very good
and her 60000 a year
that must have played some small part
in bastides calculations
none whatsoever
bastides priority you see
is a guaranteed virtue
i wonder if im beginning to guess
what it is youre intending to propose
bastide is with his regiment in corsica
for the rest of the year
that should give you plenty of time
you mean to
shes a rosebud
you think so
and hed get back from his honeymoon
to find himself the laughing stock of paris
well
yes
love and revenge
two of your favorites
no i cant
what
oh really i cant
why not
oh its too easy
it is shes seen nothing
she knows nothing
shes bound to be curious
shed be on her back
before youd unwrapped
the first bunch of flowers
any one of a dozen men could manage it
i have my reputation to think of
i can see im going to have
to tell you everything
of course you are
yes
my aunt is not on her own
just at the moment
she has a young friend staying with her
madame de tourvel
you cant mean it
to seduce a woman famous for strict morals
religious fervor
and the happiness of her marriage
what could possibly be more prestigious
i think theres something degrading
about having a husband for a rival
its humiliating if you fail
and commonplace if you succeed
where is monsieur de tourvel anyway
presiding over some endless case in burgundy
i dont think you can hope
for any actual pleasure
oh yes
you see i have no intention
of breaking down her prejudices
i want her to believe in god and virtue
and the sanctity of marriage
and still not be able to stop herself
i want the excitement of watching her
betray everything thats most important to her
surely you understand that
i thought betrayal was your favorite word
no no
cruelty
i always think that has a nobler ring to it
how is belleroche
im very pleased with him
and is he your only lover
yes
i think you should take another
i think it most unhealthy this exclusivity
youre not jealous are you
of course i am
belleroche is completely undeserving
i thought he was one of your friends
exactly so i know what im talking about
no i think you should organize an infidelity
with me for example
you refuse me a simple favor
then you expect to be indulged
its only because it is so simple
it wouldnt feel like a conquest
i have to follow my destiny
i have to be true
to my profession
all right then
come back when youve succeeded
with madame de tourvel
yes
and i will offer you
a reward
my love
but i shall require proof
certainly
written proof
not negotiable
i dont suppose theres
any possibility of an advance
goodnight vicomte
oh where have you been
time has no logic when im not with you
an hour is like a century
ive told you before
we shall get on a great deal better
if you make a concerted effort
not to sound like the latest novel
its such a beautiful day
i believe well walk
yes my lady
you didnt take the sacrament today
no
may i ask why
i have this appalling reputation
as you may know
yes i have been warned about you
you have by whom
a friend
the fact is ive spent my life
surrounded by immoral people
ive allowed myself to be influenced by them
and sometimes even taken pride
in outshining them
and now
now
what i most often feel is unworthiness
but it is precisely at such moments
that you start to become worthy
i certainly believe one should
constantly strive to improve oneself
chevalier
i dont believe you know my cousin
madame de volanges
this is chevalier danceny
and madames daughter cécile
tell us what we should think of the opera
its sublime dont you find
monsieur danceny is one
of those rare eccentrics
who come here to listen to the music
i do look forward to our next meeting
charming young man
penniless regrettably
hes one of the finest music teachers in the city
perhaps you should employ him
how are you getting on
with madame de tourvels maid
to tell you the truth
its been a bit boring
if i wasnt so anxious to keep your lordship abreast
id have only bothered the once
still what else is there to do
in the country
it wasnt so much the details
of your intimacy i was after
its whether or not shes agreed
to bring me madame de tourvels letters
she wont steal the letters sir
she wont
you know better than me
its easy making them do what they want
its getting them to do what you want
that gives you a headache
and them as often as not
i need to know whos writing to her about me
i shouldnt worry if i was you sir
she told julie she didnt believe
you went hunting in the mornings
she said she was gonna have you followed
so id say it was only a matter of time
that is a terrible noise hes making
he should get the news back to her
twice as quickly
i dont think we should make it
too easy for him
what exactly do you think youre doing
i am impounding these effects sir
has it not been explained to you
monsieur armand is not well
i dont make the laws sir
i just do what im told
everybody has to pay his taxes
how much does he owe
well uh
how much
fiftysix livres
pay him
yes my lord
monsieur armand
excuse me you dont know me
of course i do monsieur le vicomte
please dont get up
i have to theyre taking the bed
no not at all
no ones taking anything
please please please
me please please sir please
just to tide you over i insist
me sir
fiftysix livres to save
an entire family from ruin
that seems a genuine bargain
these days you can find
half a dozen like that
any village in the country
really
i must say the family was very well chosen
solidly respectable
gratifyingly tearful
no suspiciously pretty girls well done
i do my best for you sir
that humble gratitude
it was most affecting
certainly brought a tear to my eye
dijon thats from her husband
this must be from that
officious friend of hers
tell me where do you and julie meet
oh in my room sir
and is she coming tonight
afraid so
i think i may be forced
to burst in on you
see if blackmail will succeed
any better than bribery
about 200 suit you
i dont want to embarrass you
will that give you enough time
ample sir
is this true about monsieur armand
i dont believe i know anyone of that name
you may as well own up
my footman happened to be passing
when you were in the village this morning
i dont think you should pay
too much attention to servants gossip
it is true isnt it
well
yes it is
you dear boy
come and let me give you a hug
i cant understand how someone
whose instincts are so generous
could lead such a dissolute life
im afraid you have an exaggerated idea
both of my generosity
and of my depravity
if i knew whod given you
such a dire account of me
since i dont
let me make a confession
im afraid the key to the paradox lies
in a certain weakness of character
i cant see how so thoughtful an act of charity
could be described as weak
because it was simply a response
to a strong new influence in my life
yours
you see how weak i am
i promised myself
i was never going to tell you
its just that looking at you
you neednt worry
i have no illicit intentions
i would not dream of insulting you
but i do love you
i adore you
please help me
i rang a number of times
didnt hear sir
i require some hot water
right away sir
dont move
azolan
sir
wait for me in my room
you know i cant condone
this sort of behavior
i know sir
but you may rely on my discretion
thank you sir
providing of course
that you agree to my price
no no nothing like that
no all i want is
to get to see every letter
that madame de tourvel
has received since her arrival here
and every letter she writes
from now on
but sir i cant
deliver them to azolan by midnight
for your trouble
would it be very wrong of me
to answer monsieur dancenys letters
in the circumstances yes
in what circumstances
its not my place to tell you this my dear
if i hadnt become so fond of you
go on please
your marriage has been arranged
who is it
oh someone i know slightly
monsieur le comte de bastide
whats he like
well
you dont like him
oh its not that
hes a man of somewhat erratic judgment
and rather serious
how old is he
thirtysix
thirtysix hes an old man
do you know when
in the new year i believe
maybe theres a way to let you
write to monsieur danceny
oh madame
if you were to let me see
both sides of the correspondence
i could reassure myself
but i cant show you the letters
ive already sent him
i trust you slept well madame
i wish i could say that i had
i thought the least i could hope for
was that you would respect me
but i do of course
youve offended me deeply
its unforgivable
this confirms everything
ive been told about you
im beginning to think
you may have planned the whole exercise
i had no idea you were staying here
not that it would have disturbed me
in the slightest if i had known
you see until i met you
i had only ever experienced desire
love never
thats enough
no no youve made an accusation
you must allow me the opportunity
to defend myself
im not going to deny
that i was aware of your beauty
but the point is
this has nothing to do with your beauty
as i got to know you
i began to realize
that beauty was the least
of your qualities
i became fascinated by your goodness
i was drawn in by it
i didnt understand
what was happening to me
it was only when i began to feel
actual physical pain
every time you left the room
that it finally dawned on me
i was in love
for the first time in my life
i knew it was hopeless
but that didnt matter to me
its not that i want to have you
all i want is to deserve you
tell me what to do
show me how to behave
ill do anything you say
very well then
i would like you to leave this house
i dont see why that should be necessary
lets just say youve spent
your whole life making it necessary
and if you refuse
i shall be forced to leave myself
well then of course whatever you say
thank you
perhaps i might be so bold
as to ask a favor in return
i think it would only be
just to let me know
which of your friends
has blackened my name
if friends of mine
have warned me against you
i could hardly reward them with betrayal
i must say
you devalue your generous offer
if you use it as a bargaining point
very well i withdraw the request
i hope you wont think im bargaining
if i ask you to let me write to you
and pray that you will do me
the kindness of answering my letters
a correspondence with you is not something
a woman of honor could permit herself
youre determined to refuse my suggestions
i didnt say that
and youd rather be unjust
than risk showing me a touch of kindness
i would welcome the chance
to prove to you
that what lies behind this
is not hatred or resentment but
but what
listen to this
he knows exactly how far
he may venture without risk
and guarantees his own security
by tormenting only
the safest kind of victim women
madame de volanges
goodbye aunt
goodbye dear boy
monsieur please
ill write soon
my dear madame de tourvel
i have just come
dont move i said
to my desk
in the middle of a stormy night
during which
i have been
tossed
from exultation
to exhaustion
and back again
yet despite these torments
i guarantee that at this moment
i am far happier than you
well finish it later shall we
your damned cousin the volanges bitch
wanted me away from madame de tourvel
well now i am and i intend
to make her suffer for it
your plan to ruin her daughter
are you making any progress
is there anything i can do to help
im entirely at your disposal
well yes
i told danceny you would act
as his confidant and adviser
i need you to stiffen his resolve
if thats the phrase
i thought if anyone could help him
help he doesnt need help
he needs hindrances
if he has to climb over enough of them
he might inadvertently fall on top of her
i take it he hasnt been a great success
hes been disastrous
like most intellectuals
hes intensely stupid
i often wonder how you managed
to invent yourself
i had no choice did i
im a woman
women are obliged to be
far more skillful than men
you can ruin our reputation and our life
with a few wellchosen words
so of course
i had to invent not only myself
but ways of escape
no one has ever thought of before
and ive succeeded because
ive always known i was born
to dominate your sex and avenge my own
yes but what i ask was how
when i came out into society i was 15
i already knew that the role
i was condemned to
namely to keep quiet
and do what i was told
gave me the perfect opportunity
to listen and observe
not to what people told me
which naturally was of no interest
but to whatever it was
they were trying to hide
i practiced detachment
i learned how to look cheerful
while under the table
i stuck a fork into the back of my hand
i became
a virtuoso of deceit
it wasnt pleasure i was after
it was knowledge
i consulted the strictest moralist
to learn how to appear
philosophers to find out what to think
and novelists to see
what i could get away with
and in the end i distilled everything
to one wonderfully simple principle
win or die
so youre infallible are you
if i want a man i have him
if he wants to tell
he finds that he cant
thats the whole story
and was that our story
i wanted you before wed ever met
my selfesteem demanded it
then when you began to pursue me
i wanted you so badly
its the only time i have ever
been controlled by my desire
single combat
madame de volanges
your note said it was urgent
its days now i havent been able
to think of anything else
please sit down
i have reason to believe
that a
oh how should i describe it
that a dangerous liaison
has sprung up between your daughter
and the chevalier danceny
oh no thats completely absurd
cécile is still a child
she understands nothing of these things
and danceny is an entirely
respectable young man
tell me
does cécile have a great many correspondents
why do you ask
i went to her room
at the beginning of this week
i simply knocked on the door and entered
she was stuffing an envelope
into the top righthand drawer
of her bureau
in which i couldnt help noticing
there seemed to be a large number
of similar letters
i am most grateful to you
would you think it impertinent
if i were to make another suggestion
no no
if my recollection is correct
i overheard you saying
to the vicomte de valmont
that his aunt invited you and cécile
to stay at her château
she has yes repeatedly
a spell in the country
might be the very thing
thank you
you asked for hindrances
you are a genuinely wicked woman
and you wanted a chance
to make my cousin suffer
i cant resist you
i made it easy for you
but all this is most inconvenient
the comtesse de beaulieu
has invited me to stay
well you will just have to put her off
well the comtesse has promised me
extensive use of her gardens
it seems her husbands fingers
are not as green as they once were
maybe not
but from what i hear
all his friends are gardeners
is that so
you want your revenge
i want my revenge
im afraid theres only one place
you can go
back to auntie eh
back to auntie
where you can also pursue
that other matter
you have some evidence to procure
have you not
dont you think it would be
a generous gesture
to show the proper confidence
in my abilities
if we were to take
that evidence for granted
i need it in writing vicomte
now you must leave me
must i why
because im hungry
yes
i have quite an appetite myself
then go home and eat
in writing
youll be pleased to hear my dear
that armand is on his feet again
and back at work
who
monsieur armand
whose family you helped so generously
oh yes
when my nephew was last here
we discovered quite by chance
that he had gone into the village
are you all right madame
im sorry to interrupt aunt
it seemed to me all of a sudden
that madame de tourvel
didnt look at all well
im quite all right
perhaps some fresh air
do you feel constricted
i feel sure madame de volanges is right
as usual
a turn around the grounds
yes a little walk in the garden
its not too cool i think
fresh air will do you the world of good
that meal was somewhat heavy perhaps
i cant believe that was the cause
come back for it
mademoiselle
ive no wish to arouse suspicion
so ill be brief
the letter is from the chevalier danceny
yes i thought
now the handing over of such letters
is a farfromeasy matter to accomplish
i cannot be expected to create
a diversion every day
so
this key resembles your bedroom key
which is kept in your mothers room
on the mantelpiece
tied with a blue ribbon
take it go attach the blue ribbon
and put it in the place
of your bedroom key
bring it to me and i will get a copy
cut within two hours
i can collect your letters
and deliver dancenys
without any complications
now in the cupboard by your bed
youll find a feather
and a small bottle of oil
so that you may oil the lock and hinges
on the anteroom door
are you sure monsieur
trust me
believe me mademoiselle
if theres one thing i cant abide
its deceitfulness
i trust you are feeling a little better madame
if i were ill monsieur
it would not be difficult to guess who was responsible
you cant mean me do you
you promised to leave here
and i did
would you excuse me madame
quick your mother
what are you doing
i just came up to fetch your shawl
why are you so angry with me
all i can offer you is my friendship
cant you accept it
i could pretend to
but that would be dishonest
the man i used to be
would have been content with friendship
and then set about trying
to turn it to his advantage
but i have changed now
i cant conceal from you that
i love you tenderly passionately
and above all respectfully
so how am i to demote myself
to the tepid position of friend
not that youre even pretending
to show friendship
what do you mean
well is this friendly
why must you deliberately
destroy my peace of mind
you were wrong to feel threatened by me madame
your happiness is far more important to me
than my own
that is what i mean
when i say that i love you
i think we should end this conversation
i shall leave you in possession of the field
but look
we are to be living under the same roof
at least for a few days
surely we dont have to try
to avoid each other
of course not
provided you adhere to my few simple rules
i shall obey you in this as in everything
monsieur
what
nothing
nothing to worry about
have you brought a letter
no
then what
what are you going to tell your mother
how will you explain the fact
that i have your key
if i tell her im here at your invitation
i have a feeling shell believe me
what do you want
well i dont know
what do you think
no
all right all right
i just want you to give me a kiss
a kiss
thats all
then will you go
then ill go
promise
whatever you say
all right
all right
very nice
no i mean will you go now
oh i dont think so
but you promised
i promised to go when you gave me a kiss
you didnt give me a kiss
i gave you a kiss
not the same thing at all
and if i give you a kiss
lets just get ourselves more comfortable
shall we
i better see whats wrong
if you will excuse me
of course my dear
i shouldnt worry madame
the young have such
miraculous powers of recuperation
im sure shell soon
be back in the saddle
who else can i turn to
in my desperation madame
and how can i write the necessary words
theres something going on
and cécile will not tell me
you must speak to her at once
tell me
you resisted him did you
of course i did
as much as i could
but he forced you
no
not exactly
but i found it almost impossible
to defend myself
why was that did he tie you up
no no he just has a way
of putting things
you cant think of an answer
not even no
i kept on saying no all the time
but somehow
that wasnt what i was doing
i am so ashamed
youll find the shame is like the pain
you only feel it once
you really want my advice
please
allow monsieur de valmont
to continue your instruction
convince your mother youve forgotten danceny
and raise no objection to the marriage
with monsieur de bastide
when it comes to marriage
one man is as good as the next
and even the least accommodating
is less trouble than a mother
are you saying im going to have to do that
with three different men
im saying you stupid little girl
that provided you take
a few elementary precautions
you can do it or not
with as many men as you like
as often as you like
in as many different ways as you like
our sex has few enough advantages
so make the best of those you have
now here comes your maman
so remember what ive said
and above all no sniveling
how are you feeling now my dear
oh much better thank you maman
i think you look tired
i think you should go to bed
no i
you should do as your mother suggests
we can arrange to have
something brought to your room
im sure it will do you good
well perhaps you are right madame
you have such a very good influence on her
i dont think ive congratulated you
on your revenge
so you know
oh yes
and i believe from now on
youll find her door unbolted
where is she
i cant see her at the moment
surely i have explained to you before
how much i enjoy watching the battle
between love and virtue
what concerns me is that
you seem to enjoy watching it
much more than you used to enjoy winning it
all in good time
the century is drawing to its close
isnt it a pity that our agreement
does not relate to the task
you set me
rather than the task i set myself
i am grateful of course
but that would have been
almost insultingly simple
one does not applaud the tenor
for clearing his throat
as with every other science
the first thing you must learn
is to call everything
by its proper name
i dont see why we have to talk at all
without the correct polite vocabulary
how can you indicate
what you would like me to do
or make an offer of something
i might find agreeable
surely you just
you see if i do my work adequately
i would like to think
youll be able to
surprise monsieur de bastide
on his wedding night
would he be pleased
of course
hell merely assume your maman
has done her duty and fully briefed you
maman couldnt possibly talk
of anything of that sort
i cant think why
she was after all one of the most
notorious young women in paris
maman
certainly
more noted for her enthusiasm
than her ability
if i remember rightly
there was a famous occasion
before you were born
this would have been
when your mother went to stay
with the comtesse de beaulieu
who tactfully gave her a room
between your fathers
and that of a monsieur de vressac
who was her acknowledged lover at the time
yet in spite of these careful arrangements
she contrived to spend the night
with a third party
i cant believe that
no no i assure you its true
how do you know
the third party was myself
you asked me if monsieur de bastide
would be pleased with your abilities
and the answer is
education is never a waste
now
i think we might begin
with one or two latin terms
we go for a walk together
almost every day
a little further every time down the path
that has no turning
she has accepted my love
i have accepted her friendship
we are both aware of how little there is
to choose between them
i wish you knew me well enough to recognize
how much you have changed me
my friends in paris remarked on it at once
i have become the soul of consideration
conscientious charitable
more celibate than a monk
more celibate
well you know the stories one hears in paris
i feel she is inches from surrender
her eyes are closing
madame
where are you going monsieur
to the salon
there is no one there
the others have all decided
on an early night
i very much missed our walk today
yes
i fear with the weather as it is
we can look forward to very few more of them
this heavy rain is surely exceptional
yes may i
of course
but you see within a week
i shall have concluded my business
i see
even so i am not sure
ill be able to bring myself to leave
oh please you must
are you still so anxious to be rid of me
you know the answer to that
i rely on your integrity and generosity
i want to able to be grateful to you
forgive me if i say
i dont want your gratitude
what i want from you
is something altogether deeper
i know god is punishing me for my pride
i was so certain this could never happen
nothing like what love
i cant
is love what you mean
you promised not to
yes of course but i must know
i cant dont you understand
its impossible
you dont have to speak
just look at me
yes
for gods sake you must leave me
if you dont want to kill me
you must help
fetch madame
madame de tourvel has been taken ill
i heard something as i was passing
she seemed to be having difficulty breathing
oh my dear whatever is it
im all right now
i shall leave her in your capable hands aunt
we must send for a doctor my dear
no no please
i dont need a doctor i just
sit with me for a moment
i must leave this house
i am most desperately in love
to leave is the last thing in the world
i want to do but
id rather die
than have to live with the guilt
my dear girl
none of this is any surprise to me
the only thing that might surprise one
is how little the world changes
what should i do
whats your advice
if i remember rightly in such matters
all advice is useless
i have never been so unhappy
im sorry to say this but
those who are most worthy of love
are never made happy by it
but why why should that be
do you still think
men love the way we do
no
men enjoy the happiness they feel
we can only enjoy the happiness we give
they are not capable
of devoting themselves
exclusively to one person
so to hope to be made happy by love
is a certain cause of grief
i am devoted to my nephew
but what is true of most men
is doubly so of him
and yet
he could have just now
he took pity on me
if he has released you
my dear child you must go
get up sir quick
sir
what is it
over here
what is it
madame de tourvel
what
i want you to follow her right now
stay close to her
i want to know everything
where she goes who she sees
what she eats if she sleeps
everything
thats for bribes yours will come later
yes sir
now go
go
dear father anselme
try as i may i cannot see
the necessity for the interview you suggest
however since you insist
i propose you bring him to see me
on thursday the 28th at 600 pm
this is excellent
make sure father anselme receives it
what news
no visitors
there still hasnt been a single visitor
since she got back
a bit of soup last night
didnt touch the pheasant
afterwards a cup of tea
nothing else to report
oh yes sir there is
you wanted to know what she was reading
the book by her bed is
christian thoughts
volume two
how is julie
she seems a bit keener
than she was in the country
and yourself
talk about devotion to duty
off you go
keep it up
madame
vicomte
well
what a pleasant surprise
danceny
thank you monsieur for everything
well i was afraid id been
a sad disappointment to you
on the contrary
its you i have to thank
for keeping our love alive
well as to love
cécile thinks of little else
she and her mother are coming back to paris
in two weeks
and she is longing to see you
i have had the most wonderful letter from her
really
not like any of her other letters somehow
quite a different tone of voice
my dearest
danceny
i swear to you
on my chastity
that even if my mother forces me
to go through with this marriage
comma i shall be yours completely
your friend the vicomte de valmont
has been very active on your behalf
i doubt if you could do more yourself
i dont know how i could bear to go
another two weeks without seeing her
we shall have to do our very best
to provide some distraction for you
if you would be so kind
as to wait in the carriage
theres a matter i must discuss
with the vicomte in private
of course
i dont know how i can ever repay you
dont give it another thought
its been delightful
poor boy hes quite harmless
sometimes vicomte
i cant help but adore you
i have a piece of news i hope
you might find entertaining
i have reason to believe
the next head of the house of bastide
may be a valmont
what can you mean
cécile is two weeks late
arent you pleased
im not sure
your aim was to revenge yourself on bastide
i have provided him with a wife trained by me
to perform quite naturally
services one would hesitate
to request from a professional
and very likely pregnant as well
what more do you want
all right vicomte i agree
you have more than done your duty
shame you let the other one
slip through your fingers
i let her go
but why
i was moved
oh well then no wonder you bungled it
i have an appointment
to visit her on thursday
and this time i shall be merciless
i am pleased to hear it
why do you suppose we
only feel compelled to chase
the ones who run away
immaturity
i shant have a moments peace
until its over
i love her i hate her
my life is misery
well i think i may have kept our young friend
waiting long enough
i shall call on you
sometime soon after thursday
only if you succeed vicomte
i cant face another catalogue of incompetence
i shall succeed
i hope so
once upon a time you were a man
to be reckoned with
i understand father anselme
has explained to you
the reason for my visit
he said you wished
to be reconciled with me
before beginning instruction with him
thats correct
but i see no need
for formal reconciliation monsieur
no when i have as you said
insulted you
and when you have treated me
with an unqualified contempt
contempt
you run away from my aunts house
in the middle of the night
you refuse to answer
or even receive my letters
and all this
after i have shown a restraint
of which i think we are both aware
i would call that
at the very least contempt
you understand me better
than you pretend to monsieur
it was me you ran away from wasnt it
i had to leave
and do you have to keep away from me
i am as unhappy as you could
have ever wanted me to be
ive only ever wanted your happiness
how can i be happy without you
i must have you or die
death it is
im sorry madame
all i wanted from this meeting
was your forgiveness
for the wrongs that you think
that ive done you
so that i may end my days
in some peace of mind
i understood you approved of the choice
my duty has compelled me to make
yes and your choice has determined mine
which is what
the only choice capable
of putting an end to my suffering
what do you mean
i love you
you have no idea how much
just remember i have made
far more difficult sacrifices
than the one im about to make
now
goodbye
no
you must listen to me no
why should you be so upset
by the idea of making me happy
youre right i cannot live either
unless i make you happy
so i promise
no more refusals
and no more regrets
success
well
i arrived at about 6
yes i think you may omit
the details of the seduction
theyre never very enlivening
just describe the event itself
it was unprecedented
really
it had a kind of charm that i dont think
i have experienced before
once shed surrendered
she behaved with perfect candor
total mutual delirium
which for the first time ever with me
outlasted the pleasure itself
she was astonishing
so much so that i ended by falling on my knees
and pledging her eternal love
and do you know that at that time
and for several hours afterwards
i actually meant it
i see
its extraordinary isnt it
is it
it sounds to me perfectly commonplace
oh no
i assure you
but of course
the best thing about it is
i am now in a position
to be able to claim my reward
you mean to say you persuaded her
to write a letter as well
in the course of this awesome encounter
i didnt necessarily think you were going
to be a stickler for formalities
in any case i may have to declare
our arrangement null and void
what do you mean
im not accustomed
to be taken for granted
but theres no question of that
youre misunderstanding me
i have no wish to tear you away
from the arms of someone so astonishing
weve always been frank with one another
as a matter of fact
ive taken a new lover
who is proving more than satisfactory
who is that
im not in the mood for confidences
dont let me keep you
you cant seriously imagine
i prefer her to you
you may genuinely be unaware of this
but i can see quite plainly
that you are in love with this woman
no
not at all
have you forgotten what its like
to make a woman happy
and to be made happy yourself
i
of course not
we loved each other once didnt we
i think it was love
and you made me very happy
and we could again
we just untied the knot
it was never broken
illusions of course
are by their nature sweet
i have no illusions
i lost them on my travels
now
i want to come home
as for this present infatuation
it wont last
but for the moment
it is beyond my control
my dear vicomte im obliged to go away
for a couple of weeks
but im well aware of our arrangement
on my return you and i
will spend a single night together
we shall enjoy it enough
to regret it is to be our last
but then we shall remember that regret
is an essential component of happiness
all this of course
providing you are able
to procure this famous letter
it shall be done
but paris is so tedious without you
and i am living like a medieval hermit
all right give me a moment
drink up
what is it
someone who may well
not appreciate your presence
do you mean a woman
a lady we might even say
oh its not the one
we wrote that letter to
the very one
i enjoyed that
you proved a most talented desk
id like to see what she looks like
well you cant
on second thought
i dont see why you shouldnt
do you have plans for this evening
a few friends round for dinner
and after dinner
nothing firm
well
ill be there
this is an unexpected pleasure
i know that woman
are you sure id be surprised
shes been pointed out to me at the opera
yes well shes striking
shes a courtesan isnt she
yes i suppose in a manner of speaking
well im sorry to have disturbed you
you havent disturbed me
im overjoyed to see you
youll never be received
at my house again
i dont want your lies and excuses
sit down just hear me out
thats all i ask
then you can judge
unfortunately i cannot unlive
the years i lived before i met you
during those years
i had a wide acquaintance
the majority of whom were no doubt
undesirable in one respect or another
now it may surprise you
to know that emilie
in common with many others
of her character and profession
is kindhearted enough
to take an interest
in those less fortunate than herself
in short
she has the time and the inclination
to do a great deal of charity work
donations to hospitals
soup for the poor
protection for animals
anything which touches
her sentimental heart
from time to time i make a small contribution
to her purse thats all
is that true
my relations with emilie
have been for some years now
quite blameless
i mean shes even done
a little secretarial work for me on occasion
why did she laugh
i have no idea
does she know about me
no doubt she made what
in view of my past
must be regarded as a fair assumption
i want to believe you
i knew you were coming up
you were announced
im sorry
but no
no its i who must apologize
it was most insensitive of me
i didnt think it was possible for me
to love you more
but your jealousy
i love you so much
when will you start writing to me again
my dear vicomte
i dont believe this selfdenial
can be good for you
i hope it doesnt mean
youre neglecting your little pupil
but where can danceny be
i told you i have all my people out
looking for him
theres no trace of him
it is only the wind
where are you
theres nothing to be frightened about
yes there is
im bleeding
your porter seems to be
under the impression
that youre still out of town
i have in fact only just returned
without attracting the attention
of your porter
it may be time to review
your domestic arrangements
i am exhausted
naturally i instructed the porter
to inform any casual callers
that i was out
and you here as well
my dear young friend
the porter appears to be having
a somewhat erratic evening
oh well
yes
as a matter of fact
its you that im looking for
is it
mademoiselle cécile returns to paris
after an absence of over two months
now what do you suppose
is uppermost in her mind
answer of course the longedfor reunion
with her beloved chevalier
vicomte this is no time
to make mischief
nothing could be further from my mind madame
go on
imagine her distress and alarm
when her loved one is nowhere to be found
ive had to do more improvising
than an italian actor
how is she is she all right
oh yes well no to be quite frank
im sorry to tell you shes been ill
ill
calm yourself my friend
the surgeon has declared her
well on the road to recovery
but you can well imagine how desperate
ive been to find you
of course i
my god how could i have been away
at such a time
how can i ever forgive myself
but look all is well now with cécile
i assure you
and i shant disturb you further
its only that i have a little something
to show the marquise
wait in my dressing room
its through there
i know where it is
i see she writes as badly as she dresses
is it really true the little ones been ill
not so much an illness
more a refurbishment
what do you mean
miscarriage
oh vicomte i am so sorry
your son and bastides heir
isnt there something else
that we should be discussing
i do hope youre not gonna be difficult
about danceny
i know belleroche was pretty limp
but i think you couldve found
a livelier replacement
than that mawkish schoolboy
mawkish or not hes completely devoted
and i suspect
better equipped to provide me with
happiness and pleasure than you are
in your present mood
i see
if i thought you would be
your old charming self
i might invite you to visit me
one evening next week
really
i still love you you see
in spite of all your faults
and my complaints
are you sure youre not going to impose
some new condition
before you agree to honor your obligation
i have a friend who became involved
with an entirely unsuitable woman
whenever any of us pointed this out to him
he invariably made
the same feeble reply
its beyond my control he would say
he was on the verge
of becoming a laughing stock
at which point another friend of mine
a woman
decided to speak to him seriously
she explained to him
that his name was in danger
of being ludicrously associated with this phrase
for the rest of his life
so do you know what he did
i feel sure youre about to tell me
he went round to see his mistress
and bluntly announced he was leaving her
well as you can expect
she protested vociferously
but to everything she said
to every objection she made
he simply replied
its beyond my control
good night
youre only five minutes late
but i get so frightened
i become convinced
im never going to see you again
my angel
is it like that for you too
yes
at this moment for example
im quite convinced
im never going to see you again
what
im so bored you see
its beyond my control
what do you mean
well after all its been four months
so what i said
its beyond my control
do you mean you dont love me anymore
my love had great difficulty
outlasting your virtue
its beyond my control
its that woman isnt it
youre quite right
i have been deceiving you with emilie
among others
its beyond my control
why are you doing this
theres a woman
not emilie another woman
a woman i adore
and im afraid shes insisting
that i give you up
its beyond my control
liar liar
youre quite right i am a liar
and its like your fidelity a fact of life
no more nor less irritating
certainly beyond my control
stop it
dont keep saying that
sorry beyond my control
why dont you take another lover
whatever you like
its beyond my control
do you want to kill me
listen listen to me
you have given me great pleasure
but i simply cannot bring myself
to regret leaving you
its the way of the world
quite beyond my control
tomorrow morning early
yes my lord
this is not your appointed night
that story you told me how did it end
im not sure i know what you mean
once this friend of yours had taken
the advice of his ladyfriend
did she take him back
am i to understand
the day after our last meeting
i broke with madame de tourvel
on the grounds that it was
beyond my control
you didnt
i certainly did
but how wonderful of you
you kept telling me
my reputation was in danger
but i think this may well turn out
to be my most famous exploit
i believe it sets a new standard
only one thing could possibly
bring me greater glory
whats that
to win her back
you think you could
i dont see why not
ill tell you why not
because when one woman strikes
at the heart of another she seldom misses
and the wound is invariably fatal
is that so
oh yes
im also inclined to see this
as one of my greatest triumphs
theres nothing a woman enjoys so much
as victory over another woman
except you see vicomte
my victory wasnt over her
of course it was what do you mean
it was over you
you loved that woman vicomte
whats more you still do
quite desperately
if you hadnt been so ashamed of it
how could you have treated her so viciously
you couldnt bear even the vague possibility
of being laughed at
and this has proved something
ive always suspected
that vanity and happiness
are incompatible
whatever may or may not be the truth
of these philosophical speculations
the fact remains it is now your turn
to make a sacrifice
is that so
danceny must go
where
i have been more than patient
with this little whim of yours enough is enough
one reason i never remarried
despite a quite bewildering range of offers
was the determination never again
to be ordered around
i must therefore ask you to adopt
a less marital tone of voice
she is ill you know
i have made her ill for your sake
so the least you can do is
get rid of that colorless youth
havent you had enough of bullying women
for the time being
i see i shall have to make myself very plain
i have come to spend the night
i shall not take at all kindly
to being turned away
i am sorry
ive made other arrangements
yes i knew there was something
what
danceny isnt coming not tonight
what do you mean
how do you know
i know because i have arranged for him
to spend the night with cécile
come to think of it
he mentioned he was expected here
but when i put it to him
that he would really have to make a choice
i must say he didnt hesitate
hes coming to see you tomorrow to explain
and to offer you
do i have this right
yes i think i do
his eternal friendship
as you said
he is entirely devoted to you
thats enough vicomte
youre absolutely right
shall we go up
shall we what
go up
unless you prefer this
if memory serves rather purgatorial sofa
i think its time you were leaving
no i dont think so
we made an arrangement
i really dont think i can allow myself
to be taken advantage of
for a moment longer
remember im better at this
than you are
perhaps but it is always the best swimmers
who drown
now yes or no
its up to you of course
i will merely confine myself to remarking
that a no will be regarded
as a declaration of war
a single word is all thats required
all right
war
my dear chevalier danceny
i understand you spent last night
with cécile volanges
i learned this from her
more regular lover
the vicomte de valmont
im dying because
i wouldnt believe you
fetch the surgeon
no no
do as i say
a moment of your time
two things a word of advice
which of course you may ignore but
it is honestly intended
and a request
go on
the advice is
be careful of the marquise de merteuil
you must permit me to treat with skepticism
anything you have to say about her
nevertheless i must tell you
in this affair
we are both her creatures
as i believe
her letters to me will prove
when you have read them
you may decide to circulate them
and the request
i want you somehow
somehow
to get to see madame de tourvel
i understand shes very ill
that is why this is most important to me
i want you to tell her
that i cannot explain
why i broke with her as i did
but that since then
my life has been worth nothing
i pushed the blade in deeper
than you just have my boy
and now i need you
to help me withdraw it
tell her it is lucky for her
that i have gone
and im glad not to have
to live without her
tell her her love was the only real happiness
that i have ever known
will you do that for me
i will
its all very well feeling sorry now
let him be
he had good cause
i dont believe thats something anyone
