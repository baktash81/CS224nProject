bugs bunny movie without bugs bunny 
oh  my heavens  no 
you couldn t have a movie
without bugs bunny 
if you don t mind me asking  whose
glorified personal assistant are you 
kate houghton  vice president  comedy 
right 
kate did lethal weapon babies 
finally  a lethal weapon
that i can take my grandchildren to 
gentlemen  check your phones 
our latest research shows
that bugs bunny is a core asset   
that appeals to male and female 
young and old throughout the universe   
while your fan base
is limited to angry fat guys in basements 
yeah  but     come on  fellas 
i m thrice the entertainer the rabbit is 
fine  it s hilarious   
but moviegoers these days
demand action heroes  like me 
top that  rabbit 
so  it has come to this  has it 
i m afraid
the brothers warner must choose   
between a handsome matinee idol   
or this miscreant perpetrator
of low burlesque 
whichever one s not the duck

  you bested that dastardly duck 
  i did 
you re gonna offer your catch
to the pretty executive 
indeed 
miss houghton 
get out of the way 
look out 
what do you know  i found nemo 
i think she likes you 
your father would be so ashamed of you 
but i was     lt was    
at first  they told me to lose the stutter 
now they tell me i m not funny 
it s a pain in the butt
being politically correct 
you re telling me 
what kind of performance
do you call that 
you made me sound
like a total space cadet  man 
i m sorry you feel that way 
i was trying to be real to your character 
if you  like  goof on me in the sequel 
i m coming after you 
and i ll give you a scooby snack 
there are some areas of the script
i think we need to address 
there s no heart  no cooperation 
nobody learns anything 
daffy learns not to stick his head
in a jet engine 
  he s gone 
  no  daffy always comes back 
i just tell him how much i need him 
we hug  we cry 
i drop something heavy on him  i laugh 
the duck is history  okay 
so the question is   
how can i help you
reposition your brand identity 
answer  we team you up
with a hot female co  star 
usually   
i play the female love interest 
about the cross  dressing thing 
ln the past  funny  today  disturbing 
lady  if you don t find a rabbit
with lipstick amusing   
you and i have
nothing to say to each other 
look  i m trying to be nice   
but i was brought in
to leverage your synergy   
and i am not going to let you
or some wacky duck   
daffy 
wacky  daffy  nutty  fruitcake 
crispy over rice  it doesn t matter 
well  these matter 
and this 
and they say we get daffy back 
right  boys 
  we want daffy 
  bring him back 
we love daffy 
little damian 
hey  granny 
hi  tweety 
how was work today 
eventful 
what a nice young man 
guess who  so did you miss me 
i m glad i was fired 
ln a few days 
they ll be kissing my befeathered rump   
begging me to come back  but i won t 
did i miss the part where i invited you in 
i ll be too busy accepting numerous 
multiple offers 
every studio in town    
who am i kidding  my career is over 
perhaps i was being too polite  get out 
i ll starve  i ll have
to eat envelope glue 
wait  a sushi bar 
no 
  daffy 
  yes 
leave my father s house  now 
you live with daddy 
yeah  so 
just  you know  kind of temporarily 
i ve hit rock bottom 
i m hanging out with a security guard
who lives with his father 
my grease and gravy 
your dad is damian drake 
  the super spy 
  he s an actor who plays a spy 
  and that  that was his i spy award 
  ingenious 
an actor playing a super spy as a cover
for being a super spy playing an actor 
ln fact  i ll bet this whole dump
is a super spy lair 
nothing is as it seems 
you re probably protected by
an invisible force field right this minute 
the force field  penetrating apple 
just feel free to continue
your delusional ranting   
while i answer my    
remote 
hello 
  son 
  dad 
what are you doing in the painting 
i wanted to keep you out of this 
but there s no one else i can trust 
can you hold on a second 
are you shooting a movie or something 
a new damian drake movie  cool 
come to las vegas 
ask dusty tails for the blue monkey 
the blue monkey  what s a blue monkey 
a diamond  a very special diamond 
find dusty tails 
dad  you need me
to call the police or something 
  no police 
  dad  are you all right 
i m sorry i never told you this before 
but i    
  dad 
  diamond  i m rich 
  i ve joined the leisure class 
  i gotta go save my dad 
your dad  yeah 
so count me in  a spy caper 
double agents  exploding bikinis 
tigers hanging from helicopters 
i m through with show biz 
from now on 
i m gonna live the adventure 
  next stop  las vegas 
  i ll take my dad s old car 
  a super spy car  let s ride 
  this isn t a spy car 
your dad is a spy  ipso ergo  a spy car 
i used to deliver pizzas in this car 
secret pizzas 
a spy pie  maybe 
fine  be that way 
but it s definitely a spy car 
a little help here 
ducks 
you know how i know it s a spy car 
because it looks
absolutely nothing like a spy car 
i don t think this routine
is gonna work without daffy  but    
action 
say your prayers  rabbit 
it s rabbit season 
  duck season 
  rabbit season 
  rabbit season 
  wait a minute 
see  i told you
this wasn t gonna work without    
pain  agony 
you re fired 
what 
  but you   
  you got rid of our best duck 
you can t fire me 
my films have made  950 million 
  that s not a billion 
  nope  not a billion 
okay 
all right 
i think we can all agree that the decision
to get rid of daffy was a poor one 
but it s time to move on 
and by move on  i mean reversing course
and getting daffy back 
by monday 
i will have daffy back on monday 
that went well 
listen  doll face  if i know daffy 
he s already hit the road by now 
it s good to stretch 
i m getting tired
of throwing you out of the car 
that s my plan in a nutshell 
now  listen  if we run into anything
that requires super spy skills   
like cracking wise  smooching dames 
you better leave that to me 
however  if we have
any security guarding needs    
very funny  duck  i m not a security guard 
for your information  it s just a job 
it s what i do for money 
what i really do is    
i m a stuntman 
  you  a stuntman  please 
  i am  
did you see those mummy movies 
i m in them more than brendan fraser is 
no  he couldn t stand that 
one day he decides that    no  the bren 
master does all his own stunts    
listen  muscles  if this heap ever makes it
to vegas  i ll do all the stunts 
duck here 
  daffy  old chum  how the heck   
  cram it down your rabbit hole 
i think i can get you your old job back
with less of a pay cut than usual 
so not interested 
i m off to las vegas
with my new sidekick d j   
to match wits with spies and showgirls 
it s a little adventure i call 
  daffy duck s quest for the blue monkey   
and you re not in it 
blue monkey 
blue monkey 
it s a little adventure i call 
 daffy duck s quest for the blue monkey   
this is unacceptable 
we cannot have 9  year  olds working
in sweatshops making acme sneakers

he s about ready to crack  boss 
cable  input  vcr and satellite  off

with advance weapons training 
how many galoshes died
to make that little number 
what about this blue monkey 
your father was assigned to track it down
before the chairman could 
the diamond has supernatural powers 
lt would be a disaster

thanks  toots 
  carrot 
  no  thanks 
you really think that playing card
is going to help you rescue your father

you know this all sounds insane  right 
i remember the first time
i saw your dad in the movies 
so breathtaking 
your hair smells nice 
  you say something 
  no  just saying good night 
i m telling you  daffy   
i heard the warner brothers say
you were their best duck 
flattered though i may be 
flattened i will not   
in order for you to get the laughs 
it s all     and then    
  and your tail is on fire 
  exactly my point 
no  really  your tail s on fire 
daff  you re accident  prone 
what am i talking to you for 
all you have to do is munch on a carrot 
and people love you 
i need you to move my 12 00 appointment
up to 2 00 and then back to 1 1  00 
then just cancel it 
and i need you to get a helicopter and    
no  don t put me on hold 
oh  god 
i can t die out here 
this wasn t the plan 
after this comedy   
i promised myself
i would only do real movies   
about the human condition
crammed with social relevance 
there s nothing but a big rock
for 10 miles in that  that   
that  and that direction 
i say we go that way 
say  who are you kidding here 
we re goners 
water  i can t die now 
think of the millions of children
who want me to have the diamond 
the poor children 
look at that 
ls it a mirage  or just product placement 
who cares  with shopping convenience
at such low prices 
water  fresca  mountain dew 
your product name here 
ls this your idea 
the audience expects it 
they don t even notice
this kind of thing anymore 
nice of wal  mart
to provide these wal  mart beverages   
in return for us saying   wal  mart  
so many times 
where s yosemite sam 
  what is your report 
  boss  it wasn t me 
that razzan  frazzan duck
and that crazy son d j   
and a humina  humina dusty tails 
you know  that makes a lot of sense 
thank you 
mr  drake  are you going to save us
the bother of eliminating your son 
my son is going to kick your evil butt 
  mr  chairman 
  yes  dad 
  desert operative 
  no 
not a bad idea  dad 
our desert operative is due for a win 
i told you we should have
made that left turn at albuquerque 
don t start that again 
all right  here s the plan 
we wait here for the next truck or car
or camel or whatever   
and take bugs and daffy   
get back to hollywood
and finish making the movie 
what are you going to do 
  i m just gonna keep walking that way 
  that s your plan 
yep  that s the direction
the car was going 
you re not leaving me here
while you make off with my diamond 
i don t wanna get too wrapped up
in your caper   
but let s assume that you re right
and damian drake is a spy 
super spy 
what s the point of just meandering
through the desert if    
here 
be safe 
  attaboy  trust your instincts 
  yeah 
except for the water tower  the batmobile 
the rubble known as las vegas 
there s nobody as rich  famous 
and powerful as my father   
who just disappears into thin air 
suddenly i feel like
i m in aunt marge s jell  o mold 
guys  it s air  conditioned in here 
come on in 
intruder alert 
easy 
earth freak 
okay  buster   where s damian
drake and that big diamond 
cleanup on aisle three 
can i be of service 
i am monitored to respond
to the name robbie 
hi  d j 
at ease  i m mother 
yeah  like the car said
that we would be meeting you 
how do you know my name 
d j   i ve known you
since you were this big 
that s not really possible  is it 
must have been a photo 
let me just take care
of this  and we ll    
give it to me straight  how bad is it 
so  shall we 
so little to do  so much time 
you re going to put him back  right 
i can t go back to l a  with duck soup 
we do have the facilities
to reconstitute the body 
the mind though 
will remain a gooey mess 
so  about my father 
all in due time  lovely  yes  blow 
all right  break it up  fellas  nice coats 
white is the new black  you know 
yes 
look 
  so this is area 51  right 
  no 
the secret military base
where they keep the aliens 
no  area 51 is actually
a paranoid fantasy we concocted   
to hide the true identity of this facility 
  which is 
  area 52 
but don t quote me on that 
oh  right  area 52 
  so  mother   
  call me   mom   
mom  what is it
that you do here exactly  anyway 
creation  transubstantiation  destruction 
it s stressful  all kinds of things 
they re already here  you re next 
my god   
what am i going to do with you 
you ve done nothing but screw up 
you ve walked off mesas 
you ve been smashed by boulders 
you ve been run over by diesel trucks 
don t blame the equipment  it s good 
it s acme equipment 
you re a coyote  be wily 
all right  now 
buck up and let s see a little smile 
little bigger 
that s nice 
now  just go take a shower 
and don t come back till you smell better 
be careful  there re men moving a safe
out there  and i don t want you to    
and be careful
of the box of fireworks because    
i suppose i should mention
the plate  glass window    
it s tough being the boss 
a communication 
memo to marvin the martian 
obtain the playing card 
and destroy the duck 
and when i say destroy the duck 
i mean kill him viciously and painfully 
a mission  i m all a  tingle 
so  here we are
in the i  can t  tell  you  what room 
robert  can you take
care of that  please 
yes  madam 
when you bring daffy back 
could you make him 20  funnier 
  i heard that 
  what were we discussing 
this isn t about the giant ants  is it 
  giant ants 
  because they re not really ants anymore 
tell me about the blue monkey 
how do you know about that thing
that i ve never heard of in my entire life 
my dad told me 
what is the point
of making them pinky swear 
all right 
now this tape will explain everything 
lt was prepared especially for your father 
greetings  damian drake 
if you are watching this  you are aware
that the world is in grave danger 
the acme corporation is in hot pursuit
of the blue monkey diamond   
a supernatural gem with the ability
to turn people into monkeys   
and then back again 
lt is the acme chairman s goal
to turn the population   
into monkey slaves
to manufacture shoddy acme goods   
and then change them back to people
to buy the stuff 
unbelievable 
unbelievable  you may say 
your mission is this 
find it  destroy it  save humanity 
and remember 
no one wants to be turned into a monkey 
so that s why 
those guys came after my dad
because he was going to save the world 
so that means if i go after the diamond 
then the bad guys come after me 
hang on 
you re not seriously thinking about   
taking over your father s mission 
  i guess that would be all right 
  what 
listen  if you re going to be a spy 
you ll need spy stuff 
so  is this where you keep
all the high  tech spy gadgets 
yes 
that s cool  so i get
to use all this stuff 
no  your stuff is over here 
but i really like the    
all right  looks like
an ordinary cell phone 
three  way calling  voice dialing 
downloadable ringtones 
  my phone does all that 
  superconducting electromagnet 
  sorry

gps with mapping software   
tip calculator  gameboy 
gameboy 
high  powered laser 
polycarbonate rappelling line
with jet  propelled micro grappling hook 
nose hair trimmer

no  cold  cold  warm  warmer 
permit me  madam 
robert  darling  excellent choice 
swank pants 
and comfortable  too 
plus  liquid hydrogen rocket pockets 
here and here 
and stitching 
nuclear  powered crotch pad    
he ll be down in a moment 
wakey  wakey  friends 
time to wreak mayhem
in the cause of evil 
mother  just one last question 
what s the deal with this card 
that is the window
into what lies behind her smile 
what 
i m sorry  our intelligence people
feel a need to code everything in a riddle 
they get some kind of perverse pleasure
out of it  i think it s corporate 
all humans 
looks like we got company 
illegal aliens 
exterminate them 
darn  i knew this day would come 
let us exterminate them 
emergency shutdown activated 
force  barrier seal in 30 seconds 
exterminate 
the playing card  please 
i ll take that  out of my way 
hero coming through 
there is no escape 
you pesky fowl 
isn t it about time to enjoy a frosty 
cold soda at the concession stand 
exterminate 
get the lead out 
bus is leaving 
halt or be fricasseed 
that was fun 
looking for this 
now  what did she mean by a window 
the window into what lies
behind her smile 
that s the mona lisa 
  which is in the louvre 
  which is in paris 
just how are we supposed to get to paris 
like this 
lt doesn t look like
much of a window to me 
maybe the diamond is in the painting 
  all we have to do is steal the mona lisa 
  way ahead of you 
  no  you look  you don t touch  right 
  yeah 
but i m already in costume 
  that s a good look for you 
  do you think so 
wait a minute 
lt is a window

elmer never gets bugs 
it s a formula  but it works 
the great thing about movies

you and i d probably wind up together 
if you don t let go of me  i ll scream   
but i m not gonna stop screaming

stop or i ll fire 
hello

  pointillism  a technique
of using individual dots of pigment   
  which  taken together  make an image

mr  chairman  while we agree that the
tasmanian devil is quite vicious   
if memory serves  he is also really stupid

a lot easier underground

no  forget that  man  you re evil 
thank you  but    
anyway  mr  smith 
let s show this muscle  bound beefcake   
who i have sometimes been mistaken for   
what it s like to live in the real world 
have you ever been disintegrated in one
place and then reassembled in another 
fire away 
no  you don t 
i thought they fixed that glitch 
mr  smith is fired 
i have to do everything myself
around here 
  good 
  you    
henchmen 
dad 
so this is the remote that works 
this  my friend 
is the acme train of death   
which is not good news for your father 
don t worry about me  son 
i ve gotten out of worse scrapes
than this one 
you see  if the train of death
doesn t kill him   
then those crates of tnt will 
not to mention
the 2  ton anvil hanging over his head 
and look  there s the pendulum of doom 
what s the pendulum of doom
doing there  i did not order it 
it s overkill  get rid of it 
now  if you want to
keep your family   together     
i would hand over the blue monkey now 
don t worry  son  i m fine 
  you re a sick man  you know that 
  get used to it 
excuse me  what about my father 
  he s waiting for a train 
  what  you    
where s marvin the martian 
all right  here is the blue monkey 
go put it on the satellite  go 
no  you don t  eight ball 
you d never catch that rabbit
being this heroic 
  what s up  doc 
  you re despicable 
vandals 
your friends  efforts
will prove to be futile 
you see  here is the blue monkey 
here is the acme satellite 
when the blue monkey
is finally docked in the satellite   
i will transmit a beam around the world   
which will transform
everyone but me into monkeys 
now take them away 
don t you think that ll get lonely   
mr  all my friends swing from trees
and pick fleas out of their furry butts 
lonely  i suppose i could use
a little human companionship 
thanks a lot 
i ve seen you notice me 
i know i m hot 
but i prefer someone
with a little more oomph 
i prefer mary 
hello  mary 
we re a cute couple  don t you think 
take those future simians away
and lower the monkey shield 
earthlings have
the worst sense of direction 
what do you know  he fell for it 
i guess i owe you  5 
did you order satellite 
i don t even have cable 
you know  when i fired that duck   
i never would have seen this coming

cunning and nerves of steel 
so good luck  bugsy

with my bubble gun

this can t be good 
now the diamond will bathe the earth
in a monkey  transforming glow
