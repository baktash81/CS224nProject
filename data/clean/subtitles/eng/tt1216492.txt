a cranky old warlord
old enough to be her father
old enough to be her grandfather
and therefore
she wasnt
in love with him
anyway on the night
of their betrothal
whom did she meet but a
handsome young warrior diarmuid
they fell madly in love at first
sight but what could she do
well she slips a sleeping
potion in everyones drinks
and the pair of them run off
together across the shannon
fionn wakes and theres grainne
gone well he goes mental
takes his army and
heads off in hot pursuit
but it was the people you know the
people in the villages of ireland
they took pity on
diarmuid and grainne
they hid them in forests and
in their barns and castles
where theyd sleep one night
and then theyd move on
come on
is it safe
of course
sleep was all they did cause
diarmuid good man that he was
was suffering the old guilt
about twotiming fionn
and out of respect for him didnt
you know take it any further
i get it
oh yeah
and then they came
to this castle
and this view
wow
and tis said you know that
unable to resist such beauty
that here
in this place they
they consummated
their love

thank you to my husband
i want to say may you
never steal lie or cheat
but if you must steal
then steal away
my sorrows
and if you must lie
lie with me all the nights of my life
and if you must cheat
then please cheat death
because i couldnt
live a day without you

with just this apartment i
dont think you needed to propose
oh it was kind of
a package deal
really what buy an
apartment they throw in a ring
more like
the other way around
what do you mean
well i think it was
edith from the board
she called me in dublin
probing about our marital status
can you believe that nothing
specific just interested you know
like the residents theyre
kind of oldfashioned
when it comes to issues
like this blah blah blah
i got the message married
youre in unmarried youre not
so i just said we were hours
away from getting engaged
i just said it
and it came out
and i dont know
where it came from
but i could almost hear
them cutting our keys
so i put down the phone
and thought well

to it eventually right
