of years ago 
there was this beautiful
girl called grainne 
now  she was promised in marriage
to this fella called fionn 
who was kind of
a cranky old warlord 
old enough to be her father 
old enough to be her grandfather 
and therefore
she wasn t
in love with him 
anyway  on the night
of their betrothal 
whom did she meet but a
handsome young warrior  diarmuid 
they fell madly in love at first
sight  but what could she do 
well  she slips a sleeping
potion in everyone s drinks 
and the pair of them run off
together across the shannon 
fionn wakes and there s grainne
gone  well  he goes mental 
takes his army and
heads off in hot pursuit 
but it was the people  you know  the
people in the villages of ireland 
they took pity on
diarmuid and grainne 
they hid them in forests and
in their barns and castles 
where they d sleep one night
and then they d move on 
come on 
is it safe 
of course 
sleep was all they did   cause
diarmuid  good man that he was 
was suffering the old guilt
about two timing fionn
and out of respect for him  didn t 
you know  take it any further 
i get it 
oh  yeah 
and then they came
to this castle
and this view 
wow 
and  tis said  you know  that 
unable to resist such beauty 
that here 
in this place  they   
they consummated
their love 
oh  my god

i m the young woman on
the eve of her engagement
that can t resist a handsome
stranger  oh  come on

your own window and take it 
hold on a minute there 
you can show us the color
of your wallet for a change 
that s all 
drinks on the house 
i feel like your
whole happy ending
is gonna be a real test
for our friendship 
i m pretty sure she
would have been happy
with just this apartment  i
don t think you needed to propose 
oh  it was kind of
a package deal 
really  what  buy an
apartment  they throw in a ring 
more like
the other way around 
what do you mean 
well  i think it was
edith  from the board 
she called me in dublin 
probing about our marital status 
can you believe that  nothing
specific  just interested  you know 
like the residents  they re
kind of old fashioned
when it comes to issues
like this  blah  blah  blah 
i got the message  married 
you re in  unmarried  you re not 
so i just said we were hours
away from getting engaged 
i just said it
and it came out 
and i don t know
where it came from 
but i could almost hear
them cutting our keys 
so i put down the phone
and thought   well 
 why the hell not 
you know  
  really 
  sure  i mean 
we d have gotten around
to it eventually  right 
  right  of course 
  yeah 
yeah 
oh  libby  i want
to show you this view 
  yeah 
  yeah 
  it s gorgeous 
  okay

really 
okay  everybody  i guess we d
better take this party downstairs 
the phones 
where is the remote
for this thing 
these things are useless
without the remote  anna 
do you have
everything you need 
can you just look
around for valuables 
for laptops 
cameras  whatever 
i think the cameras    okay

jeremy and i   
it didn t work out 
sorry 
well 
when my 60 seconds
came around  i realized
i had everything
i ever wanted
but nothing
i really needed 
and i think that
what i need is here 
and i came all this way to see
if maybe you might think so  too 
and if you do   
well  i don t really have any plans
past that  which is new for me 
so 
declan o callaghan

learn your middle name

i propose
we not make plans 
i propose we give
this thing a chance
and let it work out
how it works out 
so what do you say 
do you want to
not make plans with me 
i guess
that s an irish no 
mrs  o bradycallaghan 
where the hell

i didn t say no 
i didn t say anything 
you walked away 
i was getting something 
really  that was a good
time to go get something
