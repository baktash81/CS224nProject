the place you ended up
when all the things
she was counting on fell through
work apartment boyfriend
not always in that order
but i loved it
to me grandpas house was
a revolving door of cousins and aunts
with a full complement
of laughter and tears
and an occasional nervous breakdown
but above all
its where uncle charlie lived
and when youre 11 years old
you want an uncle charlie

the voice fled the state
it was about this same period
that he called up drunk

getting tired of dreaming alone
like all the lonely people
i had known
you like living
at your grandfathers house
yeah
i mean no
yes or no
i mean i like it but mom doesnt
well i think your grandfather
is a good man
marches to his own drummer
but thats what i like about him
mom says he might have lost his mind
well theres that too
sometimes your own drummer is a bad idea
was nothing that i had not
seen in your eyes
it makes mom sad having to keep
going to grandpas house
i was so afraid to touch you
she blame me
so i just watched you sleeping
see the thing about women
sometimes they dont think about
the cause and effect of things
they want freedom
but then they blame you
for dispensing it once they get it
at least thats my experience
one swinging dick to another
ill give you that one
spent so many nights awaiting
hey your mom tells me you listen
to your old man on the radio a lot
she says i listen too much
or try to find you
you change stations a lot
chuckles
thats the management
you want to be a disc jockey
when you grow up
im gonna be a lawyer
jesus why
mom wants me to
talk a lot of shit and believe anything
but in the gold of morning
all right
good to see you young man
i got a barbecue meeting with a sponsor
music stops

you can have any name you want
magic by pilot playing
man who was the guy
pitched a nohitter on acid
man 2 dock ellis
charlie you can take acid
you can take fucking drano
you know what im saying
but you commit you make a decision
you shit or wind your watch
you fucking call it a day
or run for president and thats it
crazy music playing
in the morning light
what do you need me to do
sighs mom cant go to something
oh
i mean what cant she go to
where we going
never believe its not
man
sorry to make you wait
sighs how can i help
uh well im not sure
uh someone said he was having
uh tantrums
maybe you said that
his mothers a secretary
shes busy shes not here so i came
maybe you can tell me
what this is all about
the boy wont tell me
what his name stands for
doesnt stand for anything
his name is jr
deal with it
chuckles softly
maybe this is a weird time for me
to tell you that im not a psychologist
why do you say that
well because im not a psychologist
and im sitting here with somebody
who actually is a psychologist
who maybe knows im not a psychologist
what are you fucking inert
chuckles all right
this is your thing
nothing is face value
and youre the smartest guy in the room
and you sit there looking for errors
in baseline perception
oh yeah we all have our jobs
you have yours knock yourself out
psychologist
jr those are his initials
charlie
or its the contraction for junior
what fucking difference does it make
well theres a very big difference
if it is being concealed from him
that hes a junior
because there is no senior in his life
charlie that may never
have occurred to him until you just
laid your line of bullshit
on the subject to him right to his face
it is my belief that the uncertainty
about the meaning of his name
and the continual questions about it
have left him without identity
very impressive
no identity hence identity crisis
he has no identity which causes rage
he has dubiety
about his identity possibly
how sure are you about your identity hmm
im curious because
you seem very interested
in his father and his absence
and you cast it
in this very negative light
and bring the kid in here
and youre traumatizing him
we both know youre calling his mother up
and asking her out on dates
um thats
so youre willing to traumatize
a little kid
in order to hit on his mother
future jr uncle charlie never had
the money to go to college
he was selftaught
but that didnt mean some dimestore
fifthgrade shrink could go toe to toe
typewriter bell dings

come here come with me

about all those
priest
so yale interview
chuckles yeah
your mother must be thrilled
laughs
yeah you know its all she ever wanted
in my official capacity
i have to say is the only thing
to concentrate on in this world
is the desire to see
the face of god the father
right
however the church is on her last legs
three people come to my mass

professor van dyke
you will be making the acquaintance
of satan
not in your own worst impulses
or among your friends
though you will in each case
but in paradise lost
for the time being in this class
though i beat against barbarous current
i still teach western literature
in which everything derives
from two epic poems
the iliad and the odyssey
handily contained for you in one book
edited and translated by me
the iliad and the odyssey
are the two seedlings
the poyims 3000 years old
whats a poyim
somebody whos not jewish
van dyke
the iliad and the odyssey are universal
they are stories about going home
you will start by reading half the iliad
and write me a tenpage paper
any questions yes
uh a paper on what
the first half of the iliad
no right but on what subject
the first half of the iliad
hes throwing down
van dyke
now as some of you hopefully may know
the iliad is an ancient greek epic poem
in dactylic hexameter
hey
hmm
who is that
who
in the purple
wesley ah she goes out with stinky
jr stinky
yeah hes wealthy
van dyke grand style
of western classical poetry
so take note of these
and other examples of its use
as you make your way through the text
ovids metamorphos
crickets chirping
because everything i see is unattainable
thats because youre probably
being a pussy
well if youre made to read

once you understand that
you can operate in america
if you also have a car
good times by chic playing
wesley
spent all of last summer in europe
italy jesus venice
you ever been to venice
no
most illogical city
i have ever seen in my life
the cab is a boat
the garbage truck is a boat
not one bit of it makes any sense
so howd you end up in venice
studied hard i got good grades
my old man said pick a city
so my brother used to make me go with him
and watch dont look now
with donald sutherland
jesus how old were you
that movie made a man out of me
but it took place in venice
first movie was the exorcist
my brother had a hardon
for julie christie
anyway long story short i picked venice
three weeks turns into three months
and the exorcist scared the fuck
out of me by the way
the moral of the story is
right right the moral of the story is
do well in school
and you get to see italy
sidney
hi
hi
how are you uh is stinky in there
i dont know where alex is
i dont see much of him

sidney

i doubt it
both laughing
so uh hows your iliad
oh laughs
jr chuckles

my iliad is just getting better and better
as the evening progresses
is that so
yeah
laughs
howhow was the party
um not great

ill walk you
okay
you silly fool

we want the best

sidney
so what does jr stand for
its a complicated thing
ill tell you when i know you better
is there trauma
yes
fatherbased
im named after my father
but ive only seen him a couple of times
he was always on the radio in new york
he was johnny ace
or johnny michaels on the radio
are you in search for your father
chuckling
no im not
if you have a father complex
its kind of a red flag
women with father complexes
tend to eat a lot
but men get really fuckedup
i dont have a father complex
hes just a guy on the radio
thats a relief
sidney laughing
so what do you want to be jr
other than an emotional mess
oh other than that
mmhmm
i want to be a writer
im going to be a writer
why a writer
ever since i was a kid ive just
i love to read everything
i could get my hands on
every great writer every great book
i got into yale to be a lawyer
you dont look like a lawyer
jr chuckles
ill take that as a compliment
you do that
both chuckle
this is me
you want to study together tomorrow
okay

good night jr
good night
footsteps ascending stairs

mom

jesus mom fuck
shes clever shes perceptive
perceptive about what
never mind
what shes rich
probably loweruppermiddle class
thats my boy
mom i dont know what that means
lowermiddleupper
it means the people
who think theyre rich
the actual rich you never see
they hide so people wont kill them
i mean i just feel like
sidneys so up here
and im so down here
no you have so much to offer her
no money no idea what it is i want to do
besides being a lawyer
and suing my father
what thats not why
i want you to be a lawyer
that would be pathological jr
its not the worst thing if the man
puts the woman on a slight pedestal
very slight
mom falling in love is a blessing
try to enjoy it
if you get your heart broken youll live
ma i have to ask you something
what
i need to go to sidneys for christmas
vehicle approaching
music playing faintly over radio
what
what
its christmas in connecticut
with a volvo
im never gonna train you out of it am i
train me out of what
thinking things are more
than what they are
you ever been to westport
no
you ever fucked in a volvo
future jr there wasnt a thing
sidney wouldnt do or try
she taught me about love
and that semester just flew by
for both of us
i wasnt naive
i knew that my first great love
probably wouldnt be my last
but there was something about her
something different
something that gave me hope
rock your baby
by george mccrae playing
panting grunting
woman take me in your arms
rock your baby
sidney moaning loudly in other room
woman take me in your arms
rock your baby
moaning continues

song fades

laughs
mmm

well sidney tells me excuse me
chuckles so sidney
sidney tells me youre both architects
some people build houses
we build dwellings
whats the difference except the word
i mean i just failed an english exam
but a house is a dwelling
unless its a cave
and a dwelling is a house
they also run the magazine dwellings
jr
what
the magazine called dwellings
oh
i dont think you should dwell on it
light laughter
jr no
mrs lawson
i understand you have an absconded father
whos nothing more to you
than a voice on the radio
yeah pretty much chuckles softly
are you in psychotherapy
i should think you would be
no psychotherapy no
surprisingly chuckles
what does your mother do jr
she dwells in manhasset
in a house with her parents
who are both kind of nuts
and shes a secretary
and one of the things she always
loved to do was ride around
looking at houses like this one
and wonder what life must be like in them
now i can tell her
please do
i will
phil
what do you study
you know phil i study people
i think ive always studied people
and this is great
jr is a writer
i mean what do you study at yale
usual fucking bullshit
my mother wants me to be a lawyer
she sounds like a very intelligent woman
if a trifle optimistic
jr chuckles
phil you ever fucked in a volvo

60000 my house cost 12000
your house cost 7000
my house cost 7000
jr i was kind of into
the clean break idea
sidney laughs
we can be friends
just not romantic or sexual
that sounds appealing
sidney laughs
so what are you doing
im at the bar a lot
im working on my novel
publishing is heading towards memoir
people have been saying that yeah
so how many pages do you have
many
have you applied to newspapers
yeah yeah
you have clips
you contacted the new york times
would you like it if i was at the times
i love you anyway
i just dont want a relationship
but you have a relationship
its just not romantic or sexual
i think the times is probably
out of my league
was yale out of your league
can we just go to your place
no
i live with him
charlie so sidney saw you
in your reduced condition
but she was checking up on you
yeah
she was trying to see if you had
your shit together
laughing
uh
i dont even have any shit
to get together
i dont i dont have anything
hey hey hey listen
what did i tell you
about the male sciences
remember that
yeah
right have a job
right
have a car
yeah
put all your shit in it
i dont have any of that
so you can be independent
and then somebody might want you
and if they dont
you get the fuck out of there
right
jr breathing deeply
phone rings
woman new york times
yes can i tell him whos calling
man
take care
indistinct chatter
phone rings
woman new york times
hi are you jr
yes
yeah you can come with me
woman
we all like your clips from new haven
where are you working now
im writing fiction i think
and i work at a family business
its a hospitality business
a bar on long island
chuckles
your clips are good mr maguire
they are
the editors feel they need to see more
before they make a decision
you want to see more
yes
is that good
yes
sighs
i dont have more
let me tell brian that
do you want to meet brian
chuckles softly
not if i dont have a job
why dont you come and meet him
phones ringing
heavy indistinct chatter
typewriter keys clacking
jr come in
hi sir
charlie
so do not write to her
and tell her that youve
improved your position
because that will take away
all the power and the majesty
of her finding this out for herself
i already did
can you fucking come to me
with this shit please
do not tell her you want her back
did you say that
uh yeah chuckles
did you go and
stare up at the building
like in the rain and shit
no
sidney
jr this girl has abandoned you
how many times
if someone abandons you
what does that tell you
you of all people
she just needs time you know
yeah i think youre missing
a central fact
which is that women decide
if they want something or if they dont
and it becomes very obvious very fast
but
women decide
i know but
when you met who decided
she did
there you go numb nuts
standard pattern obvious to all
you do see a pattern right
hey clears throat
jr got a job at the times
others cheering
im a im a copyboy
laughing youre a copyboy
ii get sandwiches i
hey charlie back him up on me
so your first byline
presents a uh problem
uh iinitials cannot be used
without periods
ive done some research
and harry s truman
did not use a dot after his
theyre not called dots
ee cummings uh no uh periods
and the times uses them anyway
and do you know why
cause it looks like we forgot
times style is times style
and you are jperiod rperiod maguire
period
theres no periods after a last name
my congratulations on your fine work
you got a byline in the new york times
anything else
oh no thank you
phones ringing
heavy indistinct chatter
typewriter keys clacking
chuckles
wesley
dad owns the firm
brothers are partners
sooner or later its gonna
lucky sperm club
lucky sperm club
exactly yes
here you go
thank you
so you got promoted
oh no im promoted
when i become a fullfledged reporter
and when my byline appears every day
and you still wont have the background
sidneys looking for
and youll be mainly blossoming
as a barfly
uhhuh well
ah you know genetics is tough
what are you gonna do
incidentally where is the old man
uh somewhere south
mm
you know youre becoming
like your mother about yale
oh yeah
yeah you think the times means something
yeah because it does
its the new york fucking times
no no it doesnt
well what does mean something
a book with a book youll go years
before you realize that
that doesnt mean anything either
and im telling you jr i promise you
whether you write at the times
whether you write this book
sidney will still never call you
out of the blue to get you back
okay and do you know why
why
why wont sidney ever call me
genius who knows everything
because shes dumped you like nine times
scoffs
because she doesnt love you man
because shes getting married
on memorial day
good time charlies got the blues

thats true
you want to know what i think

i think you should go back to sleep
wake up in 20 years

thats what i think
fuck you
fuck you
inhales sharply
birds chirping
groans softly
heavy indistinct chatter
typewriter keys clacking
phones ringing
stinky
hey hes looking for you
sighs this is it
lucky bastard
brian as you know
the editors have had a chance
to carefully review your work
and um its terrific
truly some of your pieces
have been outstanding
though most of them are about uh
people in bars on long island uh
both chuckle
uh some of your pieces have been
truly truly outstanding
um thats why i wish i had better news
um as you know um
when the committee meets
to consider a trainee
some editors voice support some do not
a votes taken and um
i cant tell you who voted how or why
but um the end result is
i cannot offer you
a position as a reporter
thank you
the feeling is that you lack
uh experience you know
smaller newspaper perhaps you know
some place where you can uh
learn and grow
no thank you
phones ringing
heavy indistinct chatter
typewriter keys clacking
its your mom
hello
charlie
dont look at me like that
they said it was minor
let me tell you something
it may be possible to kill me
but it is not easy
okay you sure youre all right
yeah im fine
good be out of here in a few days
sighs
whats going on whats up
ah
well they didnt offer me that position
pure gold
all those assholes are now characters
yeah i guess so
this incident itself is dramatic
you can inflate this
yeah okay
no i think so
maybe maybe this is the point where
you tell me something really important
yeah
i to be honest im not 100 sure
we should go memoir
but we have to be conscious
of the trend right
however if it is a memoir
and if its gonna have any structure
you know what you have to do
hes in north carolina doing a talk show
your father came to manhasset once
clears throat
seeking rapprochements with your mother
came on the train didnt have a car
cant have any kind
of fucking rapprochements
with any kind of chick
if you dont have a fucking car
you know this
youve told me yes
and the stashies in your wallet
maybe in the future of transportation
or in holland or whatever
things are different
but in america have a car
right
clears throat anyway your mother
already told him to fuck off
he shows up
comes into the bar
orders a well scotch neat
chuckles softly
never order a well scotch
never order it neat
its a signal
that youre reaching the end
and in his case this was 20 years ago
and then i loaned the guy
30 bucks which
i have yet to see since
and over all these years
all i really remember about him
is that fucking voice

sighs

keys jingling
for any person
place or thing
to try and pull the reins
dont say i never gave you nothing
in on me
so goodbye ill be leaving
i see no sense
in this crying and grieving
well both live a lot longer
song stops
sighs chuckles softly
whoa

whoa
chief

scram
laughter

indistinct shouting
future jr when you set out
to be a lawyer you go to law school
you get a diploma for your effort
you pass the bar
in the text it declares you
officially a lawyer
thats how most jobs work
but youre a writer
the minute you say you are
nobody gives you a diploma
you have to prove it
at least to yourself
on that day driving to manhattan
stashies in my wallet
uncle charlies car
thats the moment i knew i was a writer
and just my luck
publishing was headed toward memoir
in the mornin you go gunnin
for the man who stole your water
and you fire till he is done in
but they catch you at the border
and the mourners are all singin
as they drag you by your feet
but the hangman isnt hangin
and they put you on the street
yeah you go back jack do it again
wheel turnin round and round
you go back jack do it again
when you know shes no high climber
then you find your only friend
in a room with your twotimer
and youre sure youre near the end
then you love a little wild one
and she brings you only sorrow
all the time you know shes smilin
youll be on your knees tomorrow
yeah you go back jack do it again
wheel turnin round and round
you go back jack do it again
now you swear and kick and beg us
that youre not a gambling man
then you find youre back in vegas
with a handle in your hand
your black cards can make you money
so you hide them when youre able
in the land of milk and honey
you must put them on the table
