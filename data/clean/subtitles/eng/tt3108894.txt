it was 1973 
and after failing
to pay our rent for five months 
my mom and i had to move
back home to my grandpa s house 
 sighs 
home never meant the same thing
to my mother as it did to me 
to her  it meant failure 
the place you ended up
when all the things
she was counting on fell through 
work  apartment  boyfriend 
not always in that order 
but i loved it 
to me  grandpa s house was
a revolving door of cousins and aunts 
with a full complement
of laughter and tears
and an occasional nervous breakdown 
but above all 
it s where uncle charlie lived 
and when you re 11 years old 
you want an uncle charlie 
grandpa  everybody needs to know
the cesspool isn t taking it 
if you take a leak  take it outside 
i could use a little help in here 
i m not the maid

i saw you in the yard playing sports

 chuckles softly 
i    i got an interview at yale 
 chuckles 
future jr 
he said to be ready at 6 30 
i was ready at 4 30 so as not to fuck up 
you always remember fucking up 
so you don t want to 
the thing is  that day  i felt like i had 
that s the thing to remember about a kid 
the kid always thinks he fucked up 
i didn t know what he looked like 
i hadn t been to new york city
to see his face on billboards and buses 
i couldn t have picked him out of a crowd 
but i wondered if it was like
a thing you would always know 
as if you would always know
your father instantly 
it was possible 
   crickets chirping 
   dog barking in distance 
 vehicle approaching 
 brakes squeaking 
   engine shuts off 
   door opens

a little while later 
after being arrested while on air
for nonpayment of child support 
the voice fled the state 
it was about this same period
that he called up drunk
and said he put a contract
on my mother s life 
he also threatened to kidnap me 
but uncle charlie thought
this was a less serious threat 
as kidnapping comes with responsibilities

but here is this    the furniture is

and he s doing this   
he s farting and saying he didn t do it 
saying  apricots  for no reason

and yet you all end up back here 
mom

you are not stingy with money

  you are stingy with love 
   passes gas 
i didn t do that 
girls become wives and mothers 
that was his point of view 
  you became one of them 
  oh  shut up  you old turd 
   scoffs 
  because he is stingy
with love and understanding 
that is why i have no education

   engine starts 
  a long time ago  by jim croce playing 
  seems like such a long time ago  
  i was walking on a lonely road  
  getting tired of dreaming alone  
  like all the lonely people
i had known     
you like living
at your grandfather s house 
yeah 
i mean    no 
yes or no 
i mean  i like it  but mom doesn t 
well  i think your grandfather
is a good man 
marches to his own drummer 
but that s what i like about him 
mom says he might have lost his mind 
well  there s that  too 
sometimes your own drummer is a bad idea 
  was nothing that i had not
seen in your eyes     
it makes mom sad having to keep
going to grandpa s house 
  i was so afraid to touch you     
she blame me 
  so i just watched you sleeping     
see  the thing about women   
sometimes they don t think about
the cause and effect of things 
they want freedom 
but then they blame you
for dispensing it once they get it 
at least that s my experience 
one swinging dick to another 
i ll give you that one 
  spent so many nights a waiting     
hey  your mom tells me you listen
to your old man on the radio a lot 
she says i listen too much
or try to find you 
  you change stations a lot 
   chuckles 
that s the management 
you want to be a disc jockey
when you grow up 
  i m gonna be a lawyer 
  jesus  why 
mom wants me to 
talk a lot of shit and believe anything 
  but in the gold of morning     
all right 
good to see you  young man 
  i got a barbecue meeting with a sponsor 
   music stops 
  can i come 
  nope 
tell your mother not to spend that all
in one place 
as for you  keep listening to the radio 
see you soon  junior

hey  asshole

give me my 30 bucks
or get the fuck out of the car 
hey  don t be a fucking    you know what 
don t be trying to be
a fucking tough guy  all right 
 grunts 
jr 
why d you marry him 
mom 
i was young 
i was dumb 
i don t want to be a junior 
i don t want to have the same name 
 mom sniffles 
you can have any name you want 
  magic  by pilot playing 
man  who was the guy
pitched a no hitter on acid 
  man 2  dock ellis 
  charlie  you can take acid 
you can take fucking drano 
you know what i m saying 
but you commit  you make a decision 
you shit or wind your watch 
you fucking call it a day
or run for president  and that s it 
  crazy music playing
in the morning light     
what do you need me to do 
   sighs  mom can t go to something 
  oh 
i mean  what can t she go to 
where we going 
  never believe it s not     
man 
sorry to make you wait 
 sighs  how can i help 
uh  well  i m not sure 
uh  someone said he was having 
uh  tantrums 
maybe you said that 
his mother s a secretary 
she s busy  she s not here  so i came 
maybe you can tell me
what this is all about 
the boy won t tell me
what his name stands for 
doesn t stand for anything 
his name is jr 
deal with it 
 chuckles softly 
maybe this is a weird time for me
to tell you that i m not a psychologist 
why do you say that 
well  because i m not a psychologist
and i m sitting here with somebody
who actually is a psychologist
who maybe knows i m not a psychologist 
what are you  fucking inert 
 chuckles  all right 
this is your thing 
nothing is face value 
and you re the smartest guy in the room 
and you sit there looking for errors
in baseline perception 
oh  yeah  we all have our jobs 
you have yours  knock yourself out 
psychologist 
jr    those are his initials 
charlie 
or it s the contraction for  junior  
what fucking difference does it make 
well  there s a very big difference
if it is being concealed from him
that he s a junior
because there is no senior in his life 
charlie  that may never
have occurred to him until you just
laid your line of bullshit
on the subject to him right to his face 
it is my belief that the uncertainty
about the meaning of his name
and the continual questions about it
have left him without identity 
very impressive 
no identity  hence identity crisis 
he has no identity  which causes rage 
he has dubiety
about his identity  possibly 
how sure are you about your identity  hmm 
i m curious because
you seem very interested
in his father and his absence 
and you cast it
in this very negative light
and bring the kid in here
and you re traumatizing him 
we both know you re calling his mother up
and asking her out on dates 
um  that s   
so you re willing to traumatize
a little kid
in order to hit on his mother 
future jr  uncle charlie never had
the money to go to college 
he was self taught 
but that didn t mean some dime store

but if you don t have it immediately   
   you never get it 
and i say you got it 
oh  i knew it 
oh  i knew it  i knew it 
there s there s    there s something 
calm down  i didn t say you were good 
i said  you know  you could be 
come here  come with me

 chuckles  yeah 
your mother must be thrilled 
 laughs 
yeah  you know  it s all she ever wanted 
in my official capacity

the face of god the father 
right 
however  the church is on her last legs 
three people come to my mass 
i had four  but mrs  cafferty took a fall
because she didn t have a good son

you didn t just come down here
to come here

never keep somebody away
from their cigarettes 
poor old guy s probably
climbing the walls 
well  you know he s gonna be back in here

 jimmy chuckles 
professor van dyke 
you will be making the acquaintance
of satan 
not in your own worst impulses
or among your friends   
though you will  in each case   
but in paradise lost 
for the time being  in this class 
though i beat against barbarous current 
i still teach western literature 
in which everything derives
from two epic poems 
the iliad and the odyssey 
handily contained for you in one book 
edited and translated by me 
the iliad and the odyssey
are the two seedlings 
the  poyims  3 000 years old   
what s a  poyim  
somebody who s not jewish 
van dyke 
the iliad and the odyssey are universal 
they are stories about going home 
you will start by reading half the iliad
and write me a ten page paper 
any questions  yes 
uh  a paper on what 
the first half of the iliad 
no  right  but on what subject 
the first half of the iliad 
he s throwing down 
van dyke 
now  as some of you hopefully may know 
the iliad is an ancient greek epic poem
in dactylic hexameter   
  hey 
  hmm 
  who is that 
  who 
in the purple 
  wesley  ah  she goes out with stinky 
  jr  stinky 
yeah  he s wealthy 
van dyke     grand style
of western classical poetry 
so take note of these
and other examples of its use
as you make your way through the text 
ovid s metamorphos   
 crickets chirping 
because everything i see is unattainable 
that s because you re probably
being a pussy 
well  if you re made to read
the greatest things ever written 
that you couldn t do 
and make you feel like shit 
then how are you supposed
to become a writer 
socrates says you learn more
from a bad book than a good one 
aristotle  i think 
if you go to yale
but you don t have any balls 
how are you supposed
to be a student at yale 
i m just here on a lucky break 
it s just a lucky break 
i mean  i can do wordy gurdy all day long 
but i cannot figure out what the fuck
they are saying in henry v 
we re all here on a lucky break 
douchebag 
i m lucky sperm club  and no one s
ever noticed that i m an idiot 
it s also luck  everybody s lucky 
everybody alive is lucky
and were descended from the lucky 
our ancestors were all either fast  smart
or had really fucking good immune systems 
luck  asshole    it s why we re all here 
hmm  i never thought about it like that 
you see  you re believing
in society s bullshit interpretation
of you and everything else 
and that is why you can t write 
not because homer
makes you think you suck 
 chuckles softly 
i d really like for you
to meet my uncle charlie 
what s he do 
he runs a bar 
i would really like to meet
your uncle charlie 
  dynaflow  by parish hall playing

chaz says you re insecure at yale

and you rip his fucking lungs out 
chief

what are you reading this weekend 
aquinas 
oh  jesus christ 
what  thomas aquinas 
needed to believe there was a god 
so he offered the world concrete proof 
if you didn t believe his concrete proof 
the church would cut your nuts off 
  what are you worried about 
  i don t wanna 
you don t wanna 
this is when you push 
right now 
this is when you bet it all 
when you got nothing 
all right  fuck this

on the lower upper middle classes 
they re the ones who really suck 
once you understand that 
you can operate in america 
if you also have a car 
  good times  by chic playing 
wesley 
spent all of last summer in europe 
italy  jesus  venice 
you ever been to venice 
no 
most illogical city
i have ever seen in my life 
the cab is a boat 
the garbage truck is a boat 
not one bit of it makes any sense 
so how d you end up in venice 
studied hard  i got good grades 
my old man said   pick a city  
so  my brother used to make me go with him
and watch don t look now
with donald sutherland 
jesus  how old were you 
that movie made a man out of me 
but it took place in venice 
first movie was the exorcist 
my brother had a hard on
for julie christie 
anyway  long story short  i picked venice 
three weeks turns into three months 
and the exorcist scared the fuck
out of me  by the way 
  the moral of the story is   
  right  right  the moral of the story is
do well in school 
and you get to see italy 
sidney 
hi 
  hi 
  how are you  uh  is stinky in there 
i don t know where alex is 
i don t see much of him 
hey  jr 
  sidney 
  hey 
you re in my class 
i doubt it 
 both laughing 
so  uh  how s your iliad 
  oh   laughs 
   jr chuckles 
  my iliad s fine 
  yeah 
yeah  how s yours 
my iliad is just getting better and better
as the evening progresses 
  is that so 
  yeah 
 laughs 
how how was the party 
um  not great 
  no 
  no 
where you headed 
walking home 
i ll walk you 
okay 
  you silly fool  
  you can t change your fate  
  let s cut a rug 
a little jive and jitterbug  
  we want the best 
we won t settle for less  
  don t be a drag  participate     
sidney 
so  what does jr stand for 
it s a complicated thing 
i ll tell you when i know you better 
is there trauma 
yes 
father based 
i m named after my father 
but i ve only seen him a couple of times 
he was always on the radio  in new york 
he was johnny ace
or johnny michaels on the radio 
are you in search for your father 
 chuckling  
no  i m not 
if you have a father complex 
it s kind of a red flag 
women with father complexes
tend to eat a lot 
but men get really fucked up 
i don t have a father complex 
he s just a guy on the radio 
that s a relief 
 sidney laughing 
so  what do you want to be  jr 
other than an emotional mess 
  oh  other than that 
  mm hmm 
i want to be a writer 
i m going to be a writer 
why a writer 
ever since i was a kid  i ve just   
i love to read everything
i could get my hands on 
every great writer  every great book 
i got into yale to be a lawyer 
you don t look like a lawyer 
 jr chuckles 
i ll take that as a compliment 
you do that 
 both chuckle 
this is me 
you want to study together tomorrow 
okay 
okay 
good night  jr 
good night 
 footsteps ascending stairs 
 keys jingle  lock clicks 
mom 
so you think you re in love 
yeah  i think i m in love 
she s a lucky girl 
 scoffs  i don t know about that 
  you being careful 
  jesus  mom  fuck 
she s clever  she s perceptive 
perceptive about what 
never mind 
what  she s rich 
probably lower upper middle class 
  that s my boy 
  mom  i don t know what that means 
 lower middle upper  
it means the people
who think they re rich 
the actual rich  you never see 
they hide so people won t kill them 
i mean  i just feel like
sidney s so up here
and i m so down here 
no  you have so much to offer her 
no money  no idea what it is i want to do 
besides being a lawyer
and suing my father 
what  that s not why
i want you to be a lawyer 
that would be pathological  jr 
it s not the worst thing if the man
puts the woman on a slight pedestal 
very slight 
mom  falling in love is a blessing 
try to enjoy it 
if you get your heart broken  you ll live 
ma  i have to ask you something 
what 
i need to go to sidney s for christmas 
 vehicle approaching 
 music playing faintly over radio 
  what 
  what

i m never gonna train you out of it  am i 
train me out of what 
thinking things are more
than what they are 
  you ever been to westport 
  no 
you ever fucked in a volvo 
future jr  there wasn t a thing
sidney wouldn t do or try 
she taught me about love 
and that semester just flew by
for both of us 
i wasn t naive 
i knew that my first great love
probably wouldn t be my last 
but there was something about her 
something different 
something that gave me hope 
  rock your baby 
by george mccrae playing 
 panting  grunting 
  woman  take me in your arms  
  rock your baby  
 sidney moaning loudly in other room 
  woman  take me in your arms  
  rock your baby  
 moaning continues 
  ah ah     
 taking deep breaths 
  yeah  
  take me in your arms

  no 
  i just need a minute

 song fades 
 sighs 
morning  sport 
 jr sighs  morning 
so  my parents

 laughs 
mmm 
 mouth full  
well  sidney tells me    excuse me 
 chuckles  so  sidney   
sidney tells me you re both architects 
some people build houses 
we build dwellings 
what s the difference except the word 
i mean  i just failed an english exam 
but a house is a dwelling
unless it s a cave 
and a dwelling is a house   
they also run the magazine dwellings 
jr 
what 
the magazine called dwellings 
oh 
i don t think you should dwell on it 
   light laughter 
  jr  no 
mrs  lawson 
i understand you have an absconded father
who s nothing more to you
than a voice on the radio 
yeah  pretty much   chuckles softly 
are you in psychotherapy 
i should think you would be 
no psychotherapy  no 
surprisingly   chuckles 
what does your mother do  jr 
she dwells in manhasset 
in a house with her parents 
who are both kind of nuts 
and she s a secretary 
and one of the things she always
loved to do was ride around
looking at houses like this one
and wonder what life must be like in them 
now i can tell her 
please do 
i will 
phil 
what do you study 
you know  phil  i study people 
i think i ve always studied people 
and this is great 
jr is a writer 
i mean  what do you study at yale 
usual fucking bullshit 
my mother wants me to be a lawyer 
she sounds like a very intelligent woman 
if a trifle optimistic 
 jr chuckles 
phil  you ever fucked in a volvo

  she said   it s really not
my habit to intrude  
   furthermore  i hope my meaning
won t be lost or misconstrued  
   but i ll repeat myself

   there must be
50 ways to leave your lover  
  50 ways to leave your lover

the question is too little asked 
i don t know 
i have stuff in the yale paper 
a lot of people don t 
lot of people do   chuckles 
i always love to see you on this train 
what s your main trouble 
i m just a poor boy who wants a rich girl 
 chuckles softly 
that s been done 
she s not really rich 
she s lower upper middle 
well  you never see the real rich 
they re invisible 
do you have plans in your head
to make something of yourself 
go and sweep her away 
maybe 
if she loved you  she d take you poor 
heard it here first 
 chuckles 
i ve heard it from someone else 
also  the gatsby thing  you know 
well  what s your main theme 
since it isn t really that one

 chuckles 
 knocking 
 sighs 
you know  you really had me going 
about what 
well  for the past year

it s    my life s been hell 
about me 
  yes  about you 
   chuckles 
what do you want from me 
well  we re seniors 
i m getting agita 
is agita the root of agitation 
no  men who want things are 
you know  i think you think
i want something that i m not thinking 
unless you want me to think it 
i m seeing someone 
you got to be fucking kidding me 
future jr  i can t explain it  really 
why i kept going back 
she just had my number 
wesley  all right 
so she gets agita  whatever that is 
jr 
it s yiddish for  nerves  
wesley  all right  so she gets that
and she needs her space
and her time and all that  right 
so i have a question for you 
what do you need 
look  i m not a genius 
it s an obvious question 
what do i want 
i want to be a writer  but i suck 
well  when you suck at writing 
that s when you become a journalist

you contacted the new york times 
would you like it if i was at the times 
i love you anyway 
i just don t want a relationship 
but you have a relationship 
it s just not romantic or sexual 
i think the times is probably
out of my league 
was yale out of your league 
  can we just go to your place 
  no 
i live with him 
charlie  so  sidney saw you
in your reduced condition 
  but she was checking up on you 
  yeah 
she was trying to see if you had
your shit together 
 laughing  
uh   
i don t even have any shit
to get together 
  i don t  i don t have anything 
  hey  hey  hey  listen 
what did i tell you
about the male sciences 
  remember that 
  yeah 
  right  have a job 
  right 
  have a car 
  yeah 
  put all your shit in it 
  i don t have any of that 
so you can be independent 
and then somebody might want you 
and if they don t 
you get the fuck out of there 
right 
 jr breathing deeply 
   phone rings 
  woman  new york times 
yes  can i tell him who s calling 
man 
take care 
 indistinct chatter 
   phone rings 
  woman  new york times 
  hi  are you jr 
  yes 
yeah  you can come with me 
woman 
we all like your clips from new haven 
where are you working now 
i m writing fiction  i think 
and i work at a family business 
it s a hospitality business 
a bar on long island 
 chuckles 
  your clips are good  mr  maguire 
  they are 
the editors feel they need to see more
before they make a decision 
you want to see more 
yes 
is that good 
yes 
 sighs 
i don t have more 
let me tell brian that 
do you want to meet brian 
 chuckles softly 
not if i don t have a job 
why don t you come and meet him 
   phones ringing 
   heavy  indistinct chatter 
 typewriter keys clacking 
jr  come in 
hi  sir 
charlie 
so do not write to her
and tell her that you ve
improved your position 
because that will take away
all the power and the majesty
of her finding this out for herself 
i already did 
can you fucking come to me
with this shit  please 
do not tell her you want her back 
did you say that 
uh  yeah   chuckles 
did you go and   
stare up at the building 
like  in the rain and shit 
no 
sidney 
jr  this girl has abandoned you
how many times 
if someone abandons you 
what does that tell you 
you  of all people 
she just needs time  you know 
yeah  i think you re missing
a central fact 
which is that women decide
if they want something or if they don t 
and it becomes very obvious very fast 
  but   
  women decide 
  i know  but   
  when you met  who decided 
  she did 
  there you go  numb nuts 
standard pattern  obvious to all 
you do see a pattern  right 
hey   clears throat 
jr got a job at the times 
 others cheering 
i m a    i m a copyboy 
   laughing   you re a copyboy 
  i i get sandwiches  i   
hey  charlie  back him up on me 
so  your first byline
presents a  uh  problem 
uh  i initials cannot be used
without periods 
i ve done some research 
and harry s truman
did not use a dot after his   
they re not called dots 
ee cummings    uh  no  uh  periods 
and the times uses them anyway 
and do you know why 
 cause it looks like we forgot 
times style is times style 
and you are j period r period maguire 
period 
there s no periods after a last name 
my congratulations on your fine work 
you got a byline in the new york times 
anything else 
oh  no  thank you 
   phones ringing 
   heavy  indistinct chatter 
 typewriter keys clacking 
 chuckles 
wesley 
dad owns the firm 
brothers are partners 
sooner or later  it s gonna   
  lucky sperm club 
  lucky sperm club 
  exactly  yes 
  here you go 
thank you 
so you got promoted 
oh  no  i m promoted
when i become a full fledged reporter
and when my byline appears every day 
and you still won t have the background
sidney s looking for
and you ll be mainly blossoming
as a barfly 
  uh huh  well   
  ah  you know  genetics is tough 
what are you gonna do 
incidentally  where is the old man 
  uh  somewhere south 
  mm 
you know  you re becoming
like your mother about yale 
oh  yeah 
yeah  you think the times means something 
yeah  because it does 
it s the new york fucking times 
  no  no  it doesn t 
  well  what does mean something 
a book  with a book  you ll go years
before you realize that
that doesn t mean anything  either 
and i m telling you  jr  i promise you 
whether you write at the times 
whether you write this book 
sidney will still never call you
out of the blue to get you back 
  okay  and do you know why 
  why 
why won t sidney ever call me 
genius who knows everything 
because she s dumped you like nine times 
   scoffs 
  because she doesn t love you  man 
because she s getting married
on memorial day 
  good time charlie s got the blues 
by danny o keefe playing 
in retrospect  what you do next
is gonna be important 
waitress 
you gentlemen ready to order 
four gin martinis  up with a twist 
  everybody s gone away

  there s not a soul i know around  
  everybody s leaving town  
    some caught a freight  some caught     
  young jr  hey

   song stops 
i thought you were gonna be a writer 
i am 
no  you re not  you re a copyboy 
  i write 
  a book 
  no 
  so you re just a fuckup 
  i m not a fuckup 
  yeah  you are 
and you come from a long line of fuckups 
that s true 
you want to know what i think 
probably not 
i think you should go back to sleep 
wake up in 20 years 
tell everybody how good you could ve been 
that s what i think 
  fuck you 
  fuck you   
 inhales sharply 
 birds chirping 
 groans softly 
   heavy  indistinct chatter 
   typewriter keys clacking 
 phones ringing 
stinky 
hey  he s looking for you 
 sighs  this is it 
lucky bastard 
brian  as you know 
the editors have had a chance
to carefully review your work 
and  um  it s terrific 
truly  some of your pieces
have been outstanding 
though most of them are about  uh 
people in bars on long island  uh   
 both chuckle 
uh  some of your pieces have been
truly  truly outstanding 
um  that s why i wish i had better news 
um  as you know  um 
when the committee meets
to consider a trainee 
some editors voice support  some do not 
a vote s taken    and  um 
i can t tell you who voted how or why   
but  um  the end result is
i cannot offer you
a position as a reporter 
thank you 
the feeling is that you lack 
uh  experience  you know 
smaller newspaper  perhaps  you know 
some place where you can  uh 
learn and grow 
no  thank you 
   phones ringing 
   heavy  indistinct chatter 
 typewriter keys clacking 
it s your mom 
hello 
charlie 
don t look at me like that 
they said it was minor 
let me tell you something 
it may be possible to kill me 
but it is not easy 
okay  you sure you re all right 
yeah  i m fine 
good  be out of here in a few days 
 sighs 
what s going on  what s up 
ah 
well  they didn t offer me that position 
pure gold 
all those assholes are now characters 
yeah  i guess so 
this incident itself is dramatic 
you can inflate this 
yeah  okay 
no  i think so 
maybe    maybe this is the point where
you tell me something really important 
yeah 
i    to be honest  i m not 100  sure
we should go memoir 
but we have to be conscious
of the trend  right 
however  if it is a memoir 
and if it s gonna have any structure   
   you know what you have to do 
he s in north carolina doing a talk show 
your father came to manhasset once   
 clears throat 
seeking rapprochements with your mother 
came on the train    didn t have a car 
can t have any kind
of fucking rapprochements
with any kind of chick
if you don t have a fucking car 
you know this 
you ve told me  yes 
and the stashies in your wallet   
maybe in the future of transportation
or in holland or whatever 
things are different 
but in america  have a car 
right 
 clears throat  anyway  your mother
already told him to fuck off 
he shows up 
comes into the bar 
orders a well scotch neat 
 chuckles softly 
never order a well scotch 
never order it neat 
it s a signal
that you re reaching the end 
and in his case  this was 20 years ago 
and then i loaned the guy
30 bucks  which   
i have yet to see since 
and over all these years 
all i really remember about him
is that fucking voice 
i mean  the set of pipes 
uh  as i get older   
i wonder 
you know  like   
what was the fucking problem 
i mean   
   if   
 sighs 
do i remind you of him 
lighten up on your drinking 
 sighs 
future jr 
he was right  of course 
first thing he did when he got out
of the hospital was light a cigarette 
what s that line about old dogs
and new tricks 
speaking of old dogs   
it was time

   laughter

 indistinct shouting 
future jr  when you set out
to be a lawyer  you go to law school 
you get a diploma for your effort 
you pass the bar 
in the text  it declares you
officially a lawyer 
that s how most jobs work 
but you re a writer
the minute you say you are 
nobody gives you a diploma 
you have to prove it 
at least to yourself 
on that day  driving to manhattan   
stashies in my wallet 
uncle charlie s car   
that s the moment i knew i was a writer 
and just my luck 
publishing was headed toward memoir 
  in the mornin  you go gunnin   
  for the man who stole your water  
  and you fire till he is done in  
  but they catch you at the border  
  and the mourners are all singin   
  as they drag you by your feet  
  but the hangman isn t hangin   
  and they put you on the street  
  yeah  you go back  jack  do it again  
  wheel turnin  round and round  
  you go back  jack  do it again  
  when you know she s no high climber  
  then you find your only friend  
  in a room with your two timer  
  and you re sure you re near the end  
  then you love a little wild one  
  and she brings you only sorrow  
  all the time you know she s smilin   
  you ll be on your knees tomorrow  
  yeah  you go back  jack  do it again  
  wheel turnin  round and round  
  you go back  jack  do it again  
  now you swear and kick and beg us  
  that you re not a gambling man  
  then you find you re back in vegas  
  with a handle in your hand  
  your black cards can make you money  
  so you hide them when you re able  
  in the land of milk and honey  
  you must put them on the table
