shes gotta be punished for her sins
shes gotta burn at the stake eli
try to be reasonable now nathan
i know your sorrow believe me
i lost a loved one too remember
i know youre out of your mind
with grief
but believe me your pain will pass
just like mine did
i could accept that real easy
as long as that tongueless murderess
ends up at the stake
i demand retribution
you know what she did eli
she murdered my baby boy
before he could even be baptized
she murdered him
whats gonna happen to him now
you think hes gonna find salvation
you know how she did it eli
i seen him
his brains had leaked out
your wife broke his skull
she cracked his skull wide open
she should go to hell for this
that will be enough
there has been suffering
it is the whiskey talking now
this is not the moment to solve this
she belongs in hell reverend
he do you any harm
he just helped us out of a real fix
do i get one too
you aint old enough for that yet
why be so hard on the boy
he only acted to protect his family
that makes him an adult
his mother doesnt want him
playing with guns
its natural for a young man
to want to hold a rifle in his hands
may i offer my glass to matthew
i think its about time
you went back to bed matthew
aw dad
come on drink up
none of this wouldve happened if that
baby had been born in perfect health
but liz couldnt do nothing about that
she decided who was to live
and who was to die
that decision belongs to god
and god only
why did she not leave
that choice up to him
maybe i should go fetch her
i know youre there
and i know you can hear me
you may have no tongue
but there is nothing wrong with your ears
why do doubts rise in your heart
why are you troubled

im hereto punish you
do you love this family
ive looked at your daughter
shes almost a young woman already

please dont bear a grudge
against nathan in your heart
losing a child is the worst thing

real nice and clean too
the whole world
may see our fair city of bismuth
as a place of sodom and gomorrah
but rules do apply here
a whore cannot be allowed
to shoot down her customers with impunity
my brother runs the inferno
as a place where hardworking miners
can find welldeserved recreation
that must remain so
and so it will
let this be an example
no
come on now
a mining town has a need
for organized entertainment
and i need to know
that customers here feel safe
thats why i brought
my brother zeke to bismuth
hes a better sheriff
than this town deserves
everybody at the inferno knows that if a
girl so much as scratches a customer
shes gonna be punished
so sally knew what she had coming
but he strangled her
yeah i know it hurt me too
damn she was one of my oldest employees
but rules are rules
if you dont obey the rules youre guilty
and if youre guilty youre gonna pay
you understand that dont you hmm
tell me you understand
you know how old i was
when i first went to bed with a girl
i was 21
twentyone
while zeke he was 14
i got to watch though
i spied on him through the peephole
i never did see
what all the fuss was about
you know what everybody talked about
i couldnt see it
youre not a child anymore
i havent been for a long time
the time has come
im gonna be gentle
thats right
oh stud you sure are good
joanna
joanna
frank is in a gunfight
hey what the hell
im almost done
you see that
what do you say
we have her join us next time
this is just between me and frank
all i want is a fair fight
then what are you doing here
blow him to hell
yeah
im not a violent man
i usually work with numbers
but now im standing here
in front of you
to shoot you dead frank
my daughter is dead because of you
its men like you who think
their actions have no consequences
who are making the country
turn into what its turning into
so for my daughters sake
for every daughters sake
i have to kill you
because im a father
so you can count
and you can sure as shit talk
but what we all wanna know is
can you shoot
so when do we elope
where to
anywhere
wherever we can be free
but we are free here sort of
no were not
and you know it
facepaint me
what
paint my face with your fingers
you uh you remind me of my wife
but you dress better
you smell better you look better

nobody kisses me do you understand
fucking whore
you bit my tongue off
frank frank
oh girl you really

i warned him six times
well the fella you warned
is kind of important
up at the gold mine
now i got me a whole saloon
full of drunken fucking idiots
all howling for retribution
tell em to go fuck themselves give
them a drink on the house or something
you think im gonna waste
my hardearned money
because you girls refuse
to obey the fucking rules
get the fuck up come on
get out there
fuck you
now wheres mike

you see the rules in bismuth are clear
and all customers will get
the respect they got coming
hang the stupid whore
no no elizabeth here
shes not gonna hang
gotta hang her frank
mike aint dead neither is he
but he was a victim of her lawlessness
so he gets to make a fucking proposal
now whats it gonna be mike huh
you want this free pussy for a week
is that it
you cut that fucking bitchs tongue off
you want a trade mike huh
you want an eye for an eye
is that what you want
rinse it five times a day with alcohol
and it should heal up
sooner than youd think
no solid foods no blow jobs
will she ever be able to talk again
not much chance of that
here you go
goodbye

frank
thats suicide
but theyll come after you
besides whatre you gonna do
work in some other cathouse

i couldnt stand to miss you
god sees each and every one of you
dont think just because this is a lawless
godless place
that your actions will go
without consequences
ladies do you want to end up in hell
the nice clothing doesnt fool anybody
i know who you are
and i know what you are
what would your fathers think if they knew
your mothers weep
your fathers pluck out their eyes in shame
ive managed to find someone who doesnt
mind marrying a woman without a tongue
but it will take some travelling
hes been a widower
since the last six months
hes looking for a wife
who can cook
and who doesnt mind
that he already has a son

would you like me to dance for you
i had to wait a long time to find you
i am very disappointed
i had considered many things
but not this
is this what you wanted
what you looked for
i am prepared to forgive all your sins
i have also sinned
i am going to burn in hell forever
i gave up the right to go to heaven
but you made me do it
and only you can save me
no
yes
i have sinned because
we shouldve finished the ceremony first
paul the apostle wrote it
in the first corinthians
help me joanna
i cant
then we shall both burn in hell
i am here to save you
so that you can save me
i will make you do it
you know i will
i wont let you do that again

youre up to making this trip
well good luck
dont let anyone see that for a while
its still pretty fresh
and forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil
for thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory
forever and ever
amen
ahem
tonight
joanna is still speaking dutch
i hold you responsible for that
ill pray for the lords assistance
as a wife you have your duties
the wife does not have authority
over her own body
but yields it to her husband
please come with me
not tonight
you leave me no choice
we know why we came here
this is gods nation
the lord shed his grace
on this beautiful new country
this was our exodus
in this city on a hill
we will develop a purer form
of christianity
hadnt we all agreed
to leave the old language behind
hadnt we sworn
to do things better over here
the new world would free us
from the sins of the old
we are the bright hope of humanity
this is the promised land
and by coming here
we have become his chosen people
agatha would you tell everyone
how you received the calling
i was at home peeling potatoes
when this huge white light appeared
in that light i saw a beautiful young man
with white wings
i asked if he was an angel
and the young man nodded and smiled
hmm
arie would you be so kind
to share your story
of witness with us
for me it was more or less
the same thing
but it wasnt a man
it was a beautiful young woman
who showed herself to me
you see
we are the chosen people
a visitation like that
is not something that happens
to just anybody
you have to earn it
anna would you please
come to the front
what about you anna
have you received the calling yet
i have not been blessed in such a way
in our community everyone of age
has received such a calling you have not
what did you do anna
to anger god this much
my own wife
who cannot find the lords favour
i am ashamed of you
father i pray that my wife
will grow in her love for you
and me
may she love us with all her heart all
her soul all her mind and all her might
give me the strength to lead her
to the salvation provided by your grace
in jesuss name amen
you must wash your daughter
she is unclean
but he never raises a finger
to help out
its a womans fate
says who
says the bible
its not fair
your fathers a man of the cloth
he serves god
and leaves earthly chores to his wife
what do you want
leave us alone
i have to talk to the girl
has your mother told you
what it means to be a woman
yes
the blood has penetrated into your life
and driven out the innocence
it wont be long before men
start to find you attractive
woman i know youre listening
from now on
you must treat joanna like a woman
as of today you will do the hogs
hello lady
i saw the pump
i was hoping youd be kind enough
to let me quench my thirst
allow me to express my deepest thanks
where are you men from
oh thats a long story
maybe some other time
what about him
you take care of him
after all you are a christian i assume
god damn me
get the horse
my parents will find you two
then get the goddamn saddle
go
go on get out of here go on
damn bullet needs to get taken out
and i need taking care of too
my father wouldnt like that
yeah
you know what
dont fuckin tell him
here it comes
i reckon its about time
i introduced myself
im samuel
its nice to meet you
joanna
thank you
the girl is growing fast
hi sweetie
hes running a fever
are you sure
cause they say the best way
to take someones temperature
is with the lips huh
how old are you now child
thirteen
a fullgrown woman has
has duties in life
that a young girl cant fulfill
duties imposed by our lord himself
come with me please
your mother does not always
assume responsibilities the way she should
she does not comply
with her natural duties
do you understand what i mean
god has made you a woman
so soon for a reason
you might believe it to be a curse
but he has a reason for everything
you have as the apostle paul put it
passed the flower of your age
this is not right
you have seen the blood
shes just a child
i need not answer to you
only to god
no thank you anna
god has other plans
itll be alright
use both hands
dont let the blast scare you
youre a grown woman now joanna
could i talk to you for a moment
i want to offer my apologies
i withheld from you
that to which you have a right
that was wrong of me
apology accepted
let me make it up to you
its too late for that
i have seen how you look at her
shes your own daughter
its a sin
it does not have to be
if any man thinks
that he is behaving himself unseemly
toward his virgin daughter
if she pass the flower of her age
and if need so requires
let him do what he will
he is not sinning let them marry
you shall be scolded
no
good girl
that sure as hell took long enough
where are you going
gonna take a crap
where you want me to put this
i need some rope and i need it fast
can you get that for me
good
i had to do that
if i hadnt
hed have killed me at some point
better him than me id say
i heard that story once
the one about turning
the other cheek and all that
the only person whod say
something like that
is someone whos in control
someone who doesnt want you
to stand up to him
ive seen your mother
shes the kind of person
that turns the other cheek
are you like her
the darkness deepens
lord with me abide
when other helpers fail
and comforts flee
help of the helpless
o abide with me
why do you let him do this
ill never be like you
this is no way to live
id rather die first
the serpent said to the woman
you surely will not die
for god knows that in the day you eat
from it your eyes will be opened
and you will be like god
knowing good and evil
and when the woman saw
that the tree was good for food
and was a delight to the eyes
and that the tree was
desirable to make one wise
she took from its fruit and ate
and then the lord god
said to the woman
i will greatly multiply
your pain in childbirth
in pain you will bring forth children
yet your desire will be for your husband
and he will rule over you
this is an abomination
this is an abomination
does she not know that her body is
the temple of the holy spirit
which she received from god
this is a disgrace
she will be punished in hell
she will be transformed
into a thorny tree
and in a tortured wood
she will be punished by harpies
who will dig their sharp talons into her
until the blood comes flowing down
o lord
forgive me
you know i have tried to keep her
on the narrow way to repentance
the way is broad that leads to destruction
i spoke to her
i chastised her
but to no avail
i failed
there there
its alright
its alright
im old enough
i know
god has forgiven me
i am ready
thank you lord
thank you almighty
you saw and foresaw ail
you saw that my wife did not do
what you expected of her
that she did not love you or me
as my daughter will
lot lay with their daughters
and they bore children unto him
joanna and i shall enter
a state of matrimony
and she shall bear my children
we shall be joyous and honour you
ah let me go
fear not
no ah
no
it is the will of god
we are his chosen ones
when two people make their vows
in the name of the everlasting
they pronounce their wish
to belong to each other fully in love
together they shall search
for what god wants from their lives
together they shall perform their duties
and care for their family
my father was a real bastard
used to put cigars out on my arm
the sadistic fuck
and he was a pervert just like you
i killed him when i was nine years old
who are you
you have a real special daughter
she deserves to be free
you think you can come in here
and take that which belongs to me
yeah what do you think
that gods gonna come down here
and save you
i am as god he is as i am
i will love you
and you will learn to love me
it is gods will
i will kill you
that would not stop me
youre mad
who was that man
he put foolish thoughts in your mind
he helped me i love him
no you do not
it is lust
yes
i will beat your mother out of you
the time has come
i will be gentle
abide with me
fast falls the eventide
the darkness deepens
lord with me
he aint never gonna stop is he
ill be fine
are we there yet
ah ah
what was that
no let me go
stay there
matthew
stay there sam
whatever happens
matthew
ah
mama
matthew
oh liz
id always hoped
this place would be elis someday
i mean
he couldve
i dont know
a sawmill or something
are you sure
you ever fired one of those things before
i should be the one holding the gun
theres no use shooting
from that distance
its more difficult than you think
especially with a gun like that
i was truly prepared to forgive you
back in bismuth
i loved you
you should have seen that
youve turned against me
just like your mother
but again i have been provided
with an alternative
thats right joanna
your daughter shall
suffer for your actions
and i will make you watch
as i chastise her
and after that you will witness
how i make her a woman
you believe shes safe in there
that i cannot get to her
you left her alone joanna
never leave your loved ones alone
you should know that by now
what is the worst thing
i could do to you joanna
lucky for her she was asleep
she did not see a thing
huh what
beware of false prophets
who come to you in sheeps clothing
for inwardly
they are ravening wolves
mama ah
no mama mama
no
mama
mama
i will do to your daughter
exactly as i did to you
i am going to hurt you
as much as i can
abide with me
fast falls the eventide
i will leave the door open
i brought you this
has your mother told you
what it means to be a woman
many people believe that god
does not approve of violence
they have not read their bible
violence cleanses evil
it purifies the heart
does your heart need purifying
have you had bad thoughts
about men perhaps
do you like men
have you bled yet
i am a doomed man sam
beyond salvation
i can do whatever i want
young girls still carry
the scent of innocence
older women smell different
the time has come
people think its the flames
that make hell unbearable
its not
it is the absence of love
hey
mmhmm
well longtime no see liz
i was a broken man
couldnt go on living there
good thing the new preacher showed me
i had to go try somewhere else
he was the one told me
they was lookin for deputies
up in bismuth
i made myself up a new life there
bout a year ago
the sheriff there got himself shot
and i was chosen to replace him
while i was cleaning out his office
i found this
you shouldve changed your name liz
how many elizabeth brundys
you figure there are in this world
and how many of em
you figure dont got no tongue
elizabeth brundy
i hereby arrest you
for the murder of frank blain
your former employer
and proprietor of franks inferno
your past done caught up with you liz
as life progresses
images blur
all that remains are memories
i remember her well
she was a warrior
always in control
we often wondered
what she was thinking about
on her way down
i like to think she thought of me
i like to think she knew
i would grow up to be strong
i remember her well
at least i think i do
it feels like she always
stayed with me
watching over me
