and the lord takes away 
  the reverend 
liz   
the reverend is a man of god 
you re seeing things that ain t there 
  if jesus came back to life
after he was dead   
couldn t that happen
to abigail s baby too  
can you face paint me 
  i m doing something 
can t you tell 
  we ve come to see
if everything s alright 
  everything s just fine 
no reason for you folks
to go wasting your time 
  we d like to look for ourselves 
  rather not 
there s a doctor coming in an hour 
it s better if he takes a look 
the reverend arranged it 
  hello 
  what the hell 
  liz  
liz  
you get down here  liz 
you get down here 
i wanna see your face 
i wanna see    your face 
nathan  
don t take it out on my boy  
we can talk about this
like decent folk  
  i got no quarrel with you  eli 
i m here for your wife 
she s gotta be punished for her sins 
she s gotta burn at the stake  eli 
  try to be reasonable now  nathan 
i know your sorrow  believe me 
i lost a loved one too  remember   
i know you re out of your mind
with grief 
but believe me  your pain will pass 
just like mine did 
  i could accept that real easy   
as long as that tongueless murderess
ends up at the stake 
i demand retribution 
you know what she did  eli 
she murdered my baby boy 
before he could even be baptized 
she murdered him 
what s gonna happen to him now 
you think he s gonna find salvation 
you know how she did it  eli 
i seen him 
his brains had leaked out 
your wife broke his skull 
she cracked his skull wide open 
she should go to hell for this 
  that will be enough 
there has been suffering 
it is the whiskey talking now 
this is not the moment to solve this 
  she belongs in hell  reverend 
  he do you any harm 
he just helped us out of a real fix 
  do i get one too 
  you ain t old enough for that yet 
  why be so hard on the boy 
he only acted to protect his family 
that makes him an adult 
  his mother doesn t want him
playing with guns 
  it s natural for a young man
to want to hold a rifle in his hands 
may i offer my glass to matthew 
  i think it s about time
you went back to bed  matthew 
  aw  dad 
  come on  drink up 
  none of this would ve happened if that
baby had been born in perfect health 
  but liz couldn t do nothing about that 
  she decided who was to live
and who was to die 
that decision belongs to god
and god only 
why did she not leave
that choice up to him 
  maybe i should go fetch her 
  i know you re there 
and i know you can hear me 
you may have no tongue 
but there is nothing wrong with your ears 
why do doubts rise in your heart 
why are you troubled 
how do you sleep at night 
how does it feel to be a murderess 
do you know why i m here 
i m hereto punish you 
do you love this family 
i ve looked at your daughter 
she s almost a young woman already 
  there you are 
  i must be going 
please don t bear a grudge
against nathan in your heart  
losing a child is the worst thing
a body can go through 
i was just talking to your wife
about that same thing 
  you didn t even thank him 
fact is 
you didn t even say hello to him 
  oh  liz  nathan will come around 
right  you know what 
give me a couple of days 
i ll get somebody to come in
for the sheep 
and then we ll go up
to my pa s for a bit 
he s all alone up there anyway 
  dad

  i m just going to talk 
this has got to stop 
first shootin  our windows up 
now this 
yah  come on 
yah  yah 
i want you to stay
with your mother 
  she ain t my mother 
  matthew 
  you re gonna need my help 
  alright 
as long as you stay outside 
  but why can t i just play inside 
  why 
  and why can t i help out 
  abide with me  
  fast falls the eventide  
  the darkness deepens  
  lord with me abide  
  when other helpers fail  
  and comforts flee  
  help of the helpless oh     
  swift to its close ebbs  
  out life s little day  
  earth s joys grow dim  
  its glories pass away  
  change and     
  oh thou who changes  not   
  abide with me  
  i think we can take
that blindfold off now 
  but i promised 
  your mother won t mind

you re gonna make a fine little whore 
i can see that already 
i just bet that you can make me
real nice and clean too 
  the whole world
may see our fair city of bismuth
as a place of sodom and gomorrah 
but rules do apply here 
a whore cannot be allowed
to shoot down her customers with impunity 
my brother runs the inferno
as a place where hardworking miners
can find well deserved recreation 
that must remain so 
and so it will 
let this be an example 
no 
  come on now 
a mining town has a need
for organized entertainment 
and i need to know
that customers here feel safe 
that s why i brought
my brother zeke to bismuth 
he s a better sheriff
than this town deserves 
everybody at the inferno knows that if a
girl so much as scratches a customer 
she s gonna be punished 
so sally knew what she had coming 
  but he strangled her 
  yeah  i know  it hurt me too 
damn  she was one of my oldest employees 
but rules are rules 
if you don t obey the rules  you re guilty 
and if you re guilty  you re gonna pay 
you understand that  don t you  hmm 
tell me you understand 
you know how old i was
when i first went to bed with a girl 
i was 21 
twenty one 
while zeke  he was 14 
i got to watch  though 
i spied on him through the peephole 
i never did see
what all the fuss was about 
you know  what everybody talked about 
i couldn t see it 
you re not a child anymore 
  i haven t been for a long time 
  the time has come 
i m gonna be gentle 
  that s right 
oh  stud  you sure are good 
  joanna 
joanna 
frank is in a gunfight 
  hey  what the hell  
i m almost done 
  you see that 
what do you say
we have her join us next time 
  this is just between me and frank 
all i want is a fair fight 
  then what are you doing here  
  blow him to hell 
  yeah 
  i m not a violent man 
i usually work with numbers 
but now i m standing here
in front of you   
to shoot you dead  frank 
my daughter is dead because of you 
it s men like you who think
their actions have no consequences 
who are making the country
turn into what it s turning into 
so for my daughter s sake   
for every daughter s sake   
i have to kill you 
because i m a father 
  so you can count 
and you can sure as shit talk 
but what we all wanna know is 
can you shoot 
  so when do we elope 
  where to 
  anywhere 
wherever we can be free 
  but we are free here  sort of 
  no  we re not 
and you know it 
face paint me 
  what 
  paint my face with your fingers 
  you  uh  you remind me of my wife 
but you dress better 
you smell better  you look better 
  thank you 
  no fucking kissing 
i said  no kissing 
no kissing  goddammit 
  so you gonna buy me that drink  or what 
  sure  whiskey 
  i warned you  you sonofabitch 
nobody kisses me  do you understand   
  fucking whore 
you bit my tongue off 
frank   frank   
oh  girl  you really
gone and done it now 
i warned him six times 
  well  the fella you warned
is kind of important
up at the gold mine 
now  i got me a whole saloon
full of drunken fucking idiots
all howling for retribution 
  tell  em to go fuck themselves  give
them a drink on the house or something 
  you think i m gonna waste
my hard earned money
because you girls refuse
to obey the fucking rules   
get the fuck up  come on 
get out there 
  fuck you 
now where s mike  
  i demand retribution 
  you re gonna get it  mike 
you see  the rules in bismuth are clear 
and all customers will get
the respect they got coming 
  hang the stupid whore 
  no  no  elizabeth here 
she s not gonna hang 
gotta hang her  frank 
  mike ain t dead neither  is he 
but he was a victim of her lawlessness 
so he gets to make a fucking proposal 
now what s it gonna be  mike  huh 
you want this free pussy for a week 
is that it 
  you cut that fucking bitch s tongue off 
  you want a trade  mike  huh 
you want an eye for an eye 
is that what you want  
  rinse it five times a day with alcohol
and it should heal up
sooner than you d think 
no solid foods  no blow jobs 
  will she ever be able to talk again 
  not much chance of that 
here you go

but they ll come after you 
besides  what re you gonna do 
work in some other cathouse 
please don t do it 
i couldn t stand to miss you 
god sees each and every one of you 
don t think just because this is a lawless 
godless place
that your actions will go
without consequences 
ladies  do you want to end up in hell 
the nice clothing doesn t fool anybody 
i know who you are 
and i know what you are 
what would your fathers think if they knew 
your mothers weep 
your fathers pluck out their eyes in shame 
  i ve managed to find someone who doesn t
mind marrying a woman without a tongue 
but it will take some travelling 
he s been a widower
since the last six months 
he s looking for a wife
who can cook
and who doesn t mind
that he already has a son 
no  i figured as much  
   we will welcome you with open arms
and make sure you feel right at home
as quickly as possible 
respectfully yours   and so on and
so forth  and there s a picture 
you re gonna have a real family 
how am i gonna do that 
we re sisters 
frank would kill us 
no  you never know 
and when you ve convinced
your new husband 
you can pay for the stagecoach
from down there 
how long you think you ll need 
  you two gotta come right away 
some fella just paid a whole pile of cash
to buy out the inferno 
get your asses moving

and he bought the right
to all of y all this evening  
and if he becomes a regular customer 
well  you can all expect
a big  fat  fucking bonus 
courtesy of me 
but i demand total commitment here 
i mean  whatever happens 
whatever the fuck he wants 
he is gonna get it 
now if anybody  
i mean anyone  
does anything to ruin it for me   
well  they gonna be punished

worse than i ve punished anyone before 
but with that fucking said 
you do a good job  and  uh

would you like me to dance for you 
  i had to wait a long time to find you 
i am very disappointed 
i had considered many things 
but not this 
is this what you wanted 
what you looked for 
i am prepared to forgive all your sins 
i have also sinned 
i am going to burn in hell forever 
i gave up the right to go to heaven 
but you made me do it 
and only you can save me 
  no 
  yes 
i have sinned because
we should ve finished the ceremony first 
paul the apostle wrote it
in the first corinthians 
help me  joanna 
  i can t 
  then we shall both burn in hell 
i am here to save you
so that you can save me 
i will make you do it

well  good luck 
don t let anyone see that for a while 
it s still pretty fresh 
and forgive us our trespasses  as we
forgive those who trespass against us 
and lead us not into temptation 
but deliver us from evil 
for thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory 
forever and ever 
amen 
  ahem 
tonight 
joanna is still speaking dutch 
i hold you responsible for that 
  i ll pray for the lord s assistance 
  as a wife  you have your duties 
 the wife does not have authority
over her own body 
but yields it to her husband  
please come with me 
  not tonight 
  you leave me no choice 
we know why we came here 
this is god s nation 
the lord shed his grace
on this beautiful new country 
this was our exodus 
in this city on a hill 
we will develop a purer form
of christianity 
hadn t we all agreed
to leave the old language behind 
hadn t we sworn
to do things better over here 
the new world would free us
from the sins of the old 
we are the bright hope of humanity 
this is the promised land 
and by coming here 
we have become his chosen people 
agatha  would you tell everyone
how you received the calling 
  i was at home  peeling potatoes 
when this huge white light appeared 
in that light  i saw a beautiful young man
with white wings 
i asked if he was an angel 
and the young man nodded and smiled 
  hmm 
arie  would you be so kind
to share your story
of witness with us 
  for me  it was more or less
the same thing 
but it wasn t a man 
it was a beautiful young woman
who showed herself to me 
  you see 
we are the chosen people 
a visitation like that
is not something that happens
to just anybody 
you have to earn it 
anna  would you please
come to the front 
what about you  anna 
have you received the calling yet 
  i have not been blessed in such a way 
  in our community  everyone of age
has received such a calling  you have not 
what did you do  anna 
to    anger god this much 
my own wife 
who cannot find the lord s favour 
i am ashamed of you 
  father  i pray that my wife
will grow in her love for you 
and me 
may she love us with all her heart  all
her soul  all her mind and all her might 
give me the strength to lead her
to the salvation provided by your grace 
in jesus s name    amen 
you must wash your daughter 
she is unclean 
  but he never raises a finger
to help out 
  it s a woman s fate 
  says who 
  says the bible 
  it s not fair 
  your father s a man of the cloth 
he serves god
and leaves earthly chores to his wife 
what do you want 
  leave us alone 
i have to talk to the girl 
has your mother told you
what it means to be a woman 
  yes 
  the blood has penetrated into your life
and driven out the innocence 
it won t be long before men
start to find you attractive 
woman  i know you re listening 
from now on 
you must treat joanna like a woman 
as of today  you will do the hogs 
hello  lady 
i saw the pump 
i was hoping you d be kind enough   
to let me quench my thirst 
allow me to express    my deepest thanks 
  where are you men from 
  oh  that s a long story 
maybe some other time 
  what about him 
  you take care of him 
after all  you are a christian  i assume 
god damn me 
get the horse 
  my parents will find you two 
  then get    the goddamn saddle 
go 
go on  get out of here  go on 
  damn bullet needs to get taken out 
and i need taking care of too 
  my father wouldn t like that 
  yeah

don t fuckin  tell him 
  here it comes 
  i reckon    it s about time
i introduced myself 
i m samuel 
it s nice to meet you    
  joanna 
thank you 
  the girl is growing fast 
  hi  sweetie 
  he s running a fever 
  are you sure 
 cause they say the best way
to take someones temperature
is with the lips  huh 
  how old are you now  child 
  thirteen 
  a full grown woman has   
has duties in life
that a young girl can t fulfill 
duties imposed by our lord himself 
come with me  please 
your mother does not always
assume responsibilities the way she should 
she does not comply
with her natural duties 
do you understand what i mean 
god has made you a woman
so soon for a reason 
you might believe it to be a curse 
but he has a reason for everything 
you have  as the apostle paul put it 
 passed the flower of your age  
  this is not right 
  you have seen the blood 
  she s just a child 
  i need not answer to you 
only to god 
no  thank you  anna 
god has other plans 
  it ll be alright 
use both hands 
don t let the blast scare you 
  you re a grown woman now  joanna 
  could i talk to you for a moment 
i want to offer my apologies 
i withheld from you
that to which you have a right 
that was wrong of me 
  apology accepted 
  let me make it up to you 
  it s too late for that 
  i have seen how you look at her 
she s your own daughter 
it s a sin 
  it does not have to be 
 if any man thinks
that he is behaving himself unseemly
toward his virgin daughter 
if she pass the flower of her age 
and if need so requires 
let him do what he will 
he is not sinning  let them marry  
  you shall be scolded 
  no 
good girl 
  that sure as hell took long enough 
  where are you going 
  gonna take a crap 
  where you want me to put this 
  i need some rope and i need it fast 
can you get that for me 
good 
i had to do that 
if i hadn t 
he d have killed me at some point 
better him than me  i d say 
i heard that story once 
the one about turning
the other cheek and all that 
the only person who d say
something like that
is someone who s in control 
someone who doesn t want you
to stand up to him 
i ve seen your mother 
she s the kind of person
that turns the other cheek 
are you like her 
  the darkness deepens  
  lord with me abide  
  when other helpers fail  
  and comforts flee  
  help of the helpless  
  o abide with me  
why do you let him do this 
i ll never be like you 
this is no way to live 
i d rather die first 
  the serpent said to the woman 
 you surely will not die 
for god knows that in the day you eat
from it  your eyes will be opened 
and you will be like god 
knowing good and evil  
and when the woman saw
that the tree was good for food 
and was a delight to the eyes 
and that the tree was
desirable to make one wise 
she took from its fruit and ate 
and then the lord god
said to the woman 
 i will greatly multiply
your pain in childbirth 
in pain you will bring forth children 
yet your desire will be for your husband 
and he will rule over you  
this is an abomination 
this is an abomination 
does she not know that her body is
the temple of the holy spirit 
which she received from god 
this is a disgrace 
she will be punished in hell 
she will be transformed
into a thorny tree 
and in a tortured wood 
she will be punished by harpies 
who will dig their sharp talons into her 
until the blood comes flowing down 
o lord 
forgive me 
you know i have tried to keep her
on the narrow way to repentance 
the way is broad that leads to destruction 
i spoke to her 
i chastised her 
but to no avail 
i failed 
  there  there 
it s alright 
it s alright 
  i m old enough 
  i know 
  god has forgiven me 
i am ready 
thank you  lord 
thank you  almighty 
you saw  and foresaw ail 
you saw that my wife did not do
what you expected of her 
that she did not love you  or me 
as my daughter will 
lot lay with their daughters
and they bore children unto him 
joanna and i shall enter
a state of matrimony
and she shall bear my children 
we shall be joyous and honour you 
  ah  let me go 
fear not 
  no    ah  
no  
  it is the will of god 
we are his chosen ones 
when two people make their vows
in the name of the everlasting 
they pronounce their wish
to belong to each other  fully in love 
together they shall search
for what god wants from their lives 
together they shall perform their duties
and care for their family 
  my father was a real bastard 
used to put cigars out on my arm 
the sadistic fuck 
and he was a pervert  just like you 
i killed him when i was nine years old 
  who are you 
  you have a real special daughter 
she deserves to be free 
  you think you can come in here
and take that which belongs to me 
  yeah  what do you think 
that god s gonna come down here
and save you  
  i am as god  he is as i am 
i will love you 
and you will learn to love me 
it is god s will 
  i will kill you 
  that would not stop me 
  you re mad 
  who was that man 
he put foolish thoughts in your mind 
  he helped me  i love him 
  no  you do not 
it is lust 
  yes 
  i will beat your mother out of you 
the time has come 
i will be gentle 
  abide with me  
  fast falls the eventide  
  the darkness deepens  
  lord with me     
  he ain t never gonna stop  is he 
  i ll be fine 
are we there yet 
ah   ah 
what was that 
no  let me go 
  stay there 
  matthew 
  stay there  sam 
whatever happens 
  matthew 
ah   
mama 
matthew 
  oh  liz   
i d always hoped
this place would be eli s someday 
i mean   
he could ve   
i don t know   
a sawmill or something   
are you sure 
you ever fired one of those things before 
  i should be the one holding the gun 
  there s no use shooting
from that distance 
it s more difficult than you think 
especially with a gun like that 
i was truly prepared to forgive you 
back in bismuth 
i loved you 
you should have seen that 
you ve turned against me 
just like your mother 
but again  i have been provided
with an alternative 
that s right  joanna 
your daughter shall
suffer for your actions 
and i will make you watch
as i chastise her 
and after that  you will witness
how i make her a woman 
you believe she s safe in there 
that i cannot get to her 
you left her alone  joanna 
never leave your loved ones alone 
you should know that by now 
what is the worst thing
i could do to you  joanna 
lucky for her  she was asleep 
she did not see a thing 
huh   what 
  beware    of false prophets   
who come to you in sheep s clothing 
for inwardly   
they are ravening wolves 
  mama  ah 
no  mama  mama 
no  
mama 
mama 
  i will do to your daughter
exactly as i did to you 
i am going to hurt you
as much as i can 
  abide with me  
  fast falls the eventide  
i will leave the door open 
i brought you this 
has your mother told you
what it means to be a woman 
many people believe that god
does not approve of violence 
they have not read their bible 
 violence cleanses evil 
it purifies the heart  
does your heart need purifying 
have you had bad thoughts 
about men  perhaps 
do you like men 
have you bled yet 
i am a doomed man  sam 
beyond salvation 
i can do whatever i want 
young girls still carry
the scent of innocence 
older women smell different 
the time has come 
people think it s the flames
that make hell unbearable 
it s not 
it is the absence of love 
  hey 
mm hmm 
  well    longtime no see  liz 
i was a broken man 
couldn t go on living there 
good thing the new preacher showed me
i had to go try somewhere else 
he was the one told me
they was lookin  for deputies 
up in bismuth 
i made myself up a new life there 
 bout a year ago 
the sheriff there got himself shot 
and i was chosen to replace him 
while i was cleaning out his office   
i found this 
you should ve changed your name  liz 
how many elizabeth brundys
you figure there are in this world 
and how many of  em
you figure don t got no tongue 
elizabeth brundy 
i hereby arrest you
for the murder of frank blain 
your former employer
and proprietor of frank s inferno 
your past done caught up with you  liz 
as life progresses 
images blur 
all that remains are memories 
i remember her well 
she was a warrior 
always in control 
we often wondered
what she was thinking about
on her way down 
i like to think she thought of me 
i like to think she knew
i would grow up to be strong 
i remember her well 
at least i think i do 
it feels like she always
stayed with me 
watching over me
