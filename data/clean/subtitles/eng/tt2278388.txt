imagination is always at work 
that he s constantly
inventing an endless supply
of incidents and episodes 
that he simply dreams up
his stories out of thin air 
in point of fact 
the opposite is true 
once the public
knows you re a writer 
they bring the characters
and events to you
and as long as you maintain
your ability to look
and to carefully listen 
 door opens 
these stories
will continue to   
stop it  stop it  don t  don t do it 
 toy gun clicks 
 pellet clatters 
 footsteps recede 
uh  will continue to seek
you out over your lifetime 
to him who has often
told the tales of others 
many tales will be told 
sorry 
it s all right 
the incidents that follow
were described to me
exactly as i present them here
and in a wholly unexpected way 
a number of years ago 
while suffering from a mild
case of  scribe s fever  
a form of neurasthenia
common among
the intelligentsia of that time 
i decided to spend
the month of august
in the spa town of nebelsbad
below the alpine sudetenwaltz 
and had taken up rooms
in the grand budapest 
a picturesque  elaborate  and once
widely celebrated establishment 
i expect some of
you will know it 
young writer  it was off season and  by
that time  decidedly out of fashion 
and it had already
begun its descent
into shabbiness and
eventual demolition 
what few guests we were
had quickly come to recognize
one another by sight
as the only living souls residing
in the vast establishment 
 coins clinking 
although i do not believe any acquaintance
among our number had proceeded
beyond the polite nods
we exchanged as we passed
in the palm court 
in the arabian baths 
and on board
the colonnade funicular 
we were a very reserved
group  it seemed 
and  without exception 
solitary 
perhaps as a result of
this general silence 
i had established a casual
and bantering familiarity
with the hotel s concierge 
a west continental
known only as monsieur jean 
who struck one
as being  at once 
both lazy and  really 
quite accommodating 
i expect he was not well paid 
in any case  one evening 
as i stood conferring
elbow to elbow with monsieur jean 
as had become my habit  i noticed
a new presence in our company 
a small  elderly man 
smartly dressed 
with an exceptionally lively 
intelligent face
and an immediately perceptible
air of sadness 
he was  like the rest of us 
alone  but also  i must say 
he was the first that struck one
as being deeply and truly lonely 
a symptom of my own
medical condition as well 
who s this interesting
old fellow 
i inquired of monsieur jean 
to my surprise 
he was distinctly taken aback 
don t you know 
he asked 
don t you recognize him 
he did look familiar 
that s mr  moustafa himself 
he arrived earlier this morning 
this name will no
doubt be familiar
to the more seasoned
persons among you 
mr  zero moustafa was at one time
the richest man in zubrowka 
and was still indeed the owner
of the grand budapest 
he often comes and
stays a week or more 
three times a year at least 
but never in the season 
monsieur jean signaled to me
and i leaned closer 
i ll tell you a secret 
he takes only a single bed
sleeping room without a bath
in the rear corner
of the top floor
and it s smaller than
the service elevator 
it was well known 
zero moustafa had purchased
and famously inhabited
some of the most lavish castles
and palazzos on the continent 
yet here  in his own
nearly empty hotel 
he occupied
a servant s quarters 
at that moment  the curtain rose
on a parenthetical 
domestic drama   
shit 
   which required the immediate
and complete attention
of monsieur jean   dog barking 
but  frankly 
did not hold mine for long 
 elevator bell dings 
however 
this premature intermission in the
story of the curious  old man
had left me 
as the expression goes 
 gespannt wie ein flitzebogen  
that is  on the edge of my seat 
where i remained throughout
the next morning  until 
in what i have found to be its
mysterious and utterly reliable fashion 
fate  once again 
intervened on my behalf 
mr  moustafa  i admire your work 
i beg your pardon 
i said  i know and admire
your wonderful work 
thank you most kindly  sir 
did monsieur jean have a word
or two to share with you
about the aged proprietor
of this establishment 
i must confess  i did
myself inquire about you 
he s perfectly capable 
of course  monsieur jean
but we can t claim he s a first 
or  in earnest 
even second rate concierge 
but there it is 
times have changed 
the thermal baths
are very beautiful 
they were in their
first condition 
it couldn t be maintained 
of course 
too decadent for current tastes 
but i love it all just the same 
this enchanting old ruin 
how did you come to
buy it  if i may ask 
the grand budapest 
 unplugs drain 
i didn t 
 water running 
 man yelling 
 yelling stops 
if you re not
merely being polite 
and you must tell me
if that s the case 
but if it genuinely
does interest you 
may i invite you to
dine with me tonight 
and it will be my pleasure and 
indeed  my privilege to tell you
 my story  
such as it is 
 ordering food  indistinct 
two ducks roasted with olives 
rabbit  salad 
mmm 
pouilly jouvet  52 
plus a split of the brut 
that should
provide us ample time
if i commence promptly 
by all means 
 chuckling 
well  it begins  as it must  with
our mutual friend s predecessor 
the beloved  original concierge
of the grand budapest 
it begins  of course  with   
 knock on door 
bring the table to the window 
yes  monsieur gustave 
bring the tray to the table 
right away  monsieur gustave 
right there  have those
been brushed and blocked 
of course  monsieur gustave 
pack them in the hat boxes 
is that from
oberstdorf   company 
i believe so  monsieur gustave 
second trunk  who has the tickets 
i do  monsieur gustave 
give them to me 
these are in order 
wait in the corner 
i m not leaving 
i beg your pardon 
i m not leaving 
why not 
i m frightened 
of what 
i fear this may be the last
time we ever see each other 
why on earth would
that be the case 
well  i can t put it
into words  but i feel it 
for goodness sake 
there s no reason
for you to leave us if you d   
come with me 
to fucking lutz 
please 
give me your hand 
you ve nothing to fear  you re
always anxious before you travel 
i admit  you appear
to be suffering
a more acute attack
on this occasion 
but  truly and honestly   
oh  dear god 
what have you done
to your fingernails 
i beg your pardon  this
diabolical varnish 
the color is completely wrong 
don t you like it 
it s not that i don t like it 
i am physically repulsed 
perhaps this will soothe you 
what  don t recite 
just listen to
the words  hush 
please  not now 
 while questing once in noble
wood of gray  medieval pine 
 i came upon a tomb  rain slick d 
rubbed cool  ethereal 
 its inscription
long vanished 
yet still within its
melancholy fissures    
madame d   will you light
a candle for me  please 
in the sacristy of santa maria 
gustave h  i ll see to it
myself immediately 
remember  i m always with you 
i love you 
i love you 
 speaks german 
it s quite a thing winning the
loyalty of a woman like that
for 19 consecutive seasons 
um    yes  sir 
she s very fond of me  you know 
yes  sir 
but i ve never seen
her like that before 
no  sir 
she was shaking
like a shitting dog 
truly 
run to the cathedral of santa
maria in brucknerplatz 
buy one of the plain 
half length candles
and take back four
klubecks in change 
light it in the sacristy 
say a brief rosary
then go to mendi s and get me
a courtesan au chocolat 
if there s any money left  give it
to the crippled shoe shine boy 
right away  sir 
hold it 
who are you 
i m zero  sir 
the new lobby boy 
zero  you say 
yes  sir 
i ve never heard of you 
never laid eyes on you 
who hired you 
mr  mosher  sir 
mr  mosher 
yes  monsieur gustave 
am i to understand you ve
surreptitiously hired this young man
in the position of a lobby boy 
he s been engaged
for a trial period 
pending your approval 
of course 
uh   
perhaps  yes 
thank you  mr  mosher 
you re most welcome 
monsieur gustave 
you re now going to be
officially interviewed 
should i go and light
the candle first  sir 
what  no 
experience 
hotel kinski 
kitchen boy  six months 
hotel berlitz  mop and
broom boy  three months 
before that i was
a skillet scrubber   
experience  zero 
thank you again 
monsieur gustave 
straighten that cap  anatole 
the pleasure s mine  herr schneider 
the strap s busted 
these are not acceptable 
i fully agree 
education 
i studied reading and spelling 
i started my primary school 
i almost   
education  zero 
now it s exploded 
good morning  cicero 
call the goddamn plumber 
this afternoon 
monsieur gustave 
without fail  frau liebling 
what in hell is this  not now 
family 
zero 
six  igor 
why do you want
to be a lobby boy 
well  who wouldn t 
at the grand budapest  sir 
it s an institution 
very good 
a thousand klubecks 
my goodness 
were you ever a lobby boy  sir 
what do you think 
well  i suppose you d have
to start somewhere   
go and light the goddamn candle 
yes  sir 
mr  moustafa  and so  my life began 
junior lobby boy in training 
grand budapest hotel 
under the strict command
of monsieur gustave h 
i became his pupil  and he was
to be my counselor and guardian 
gustave h  what is a lobby boy 
a lobby boy s completely
invisible  yet always in sight 
a lobby boy remembers
what people hate 
a lobby boy anticipates
the client s needs
before the needs are needed 
a lobby boy is  above all 
discreet to a fault 
our guests know
their deepest secrets 
some of which are 
frankly  rather unseemly 
will go with us to our graves 
so keep your mouth shut  zero 
yes  sir 
that s all for now 
mr  moustafa  i began to realize
that many of the hotel s
most valued and distinguished
guests came for him 
it seemed to be an essential
pan  of his duties   
ah   laughs 
   but i believe it
was also his pleasure 
the requirements
were always the same 
they had to be rich 
old 
insecure 
vain 
superficial 
blonde 
needy 
why blonde 
because they all were 
he was  by the way 
the most liberally perfumed
man i had ever encountered 
the scent announced his
approach from a great distance
and lingered for many minutes
after he was gone 
 man sniffing 
i worked six days each week
plus a half day sunday 
5 00 am until
just after midnight 
our meals were small but
frequent  for stamina 
two breakfasts  two lunches
and a late supper 
monsieur gustave also
delivered a nightly sermon 
rudeness is merely
the expression of fear 
people fear they
won t get what they want 
the most dreadful and unattractive
person only needs to be loved 
and they will open
up like a flower 
i am reminded of a verse 
 the painter s brush
touched the inchoate face
by ends of nimble bristles
and with their
blush of first color 
rendered her
lifeless cheek living  
mr  moustafa  his own dinner 
he took alone in his room 
the identity of the owner of the
hotel was unknown to all of us 
each month  his emissary  known
as deputy kovacs  arrived
to review the books
and convey messages
on behalf of
the mysterious proprietor 
on these occasions  monsieur
gustave and our business manager 
herr becker  met with him in private
consultation above reception 
 inaudible 
this was also when i met agatha 
but we won t discuss that 
 door opening 
what do you want 
look 
gustave h  dear god 
i m terribly sorry  sir 
we must go to her 
we must 
tout de suite 
she needs me  and i need
you to help me with
my bags and so on 
 woman and gustave h
speaking french 
how fast can you pack 
five minutes 
do it  and bring a bottle
of the pouilly jouvet  26
in an ice bucket
with two glasses
so we don t have to drink the cat
piss they serve in the dining car 
i blame myself 
she tried to tell me she had a premonition 
i didn t listen 
all of lutz will
be dressed in black 
except her own ghastly 
deceitful children
whom she loathed and
couldn t bear to kiss hello 
they ll be dancing like gypsies 
there s really no point
in doing anything in life 
because it s all over
in the blink of an eye   
and  the next thing you know 
rigor mortis sets in 
oh  how the good die young 
with any luck  she s left a few
klubecks for your old friend 
but one never knows
until the ink
is dry on the death certificate 
she was dynamite in the sack 
by the way 
she was 84  monsieur gustave 
i ve had older 
when you re young 
it s all fillet steak 
but as the years go by  you have
to move on to the cheaper cuts 
which is fine with me 
because i like those 
more flavorful  or so they say 
 brakes screeching 
why are we stopping
at a barley field 
well  hello there  chaps 
documents  please 
with pleasure 
it s not a very flattering
portrait  i m afraid 
i was once considered
a great beauty 
what does the  f  stand for 
fritz  franz 
franz 
i knew it 
he s making a funny face 
that s a migratory visa with stage
three worker status  franz  darling 
he s with me 
come outside  please 
now  wait a minute  sit down  zero 
his papers are in order 
i cross referenced
them myself with
the bureau of
labor and servitude 
you can t arrest him simply
because he s a bloody immigrant 
he hasn t done anything wrong 
stop it  damn you 
never mind  monsieur gustave 
let them proceed 
gustave h  ow  that hurts 
 groaning 
you filthy  goddamn 
pock marked  fascist assholes 
take your hands
off my lobby boy 
 whistle tooting 
 door opens 
what s the problem 
this is outrageous 
the young man works for me at the
grand budapest hotel in nebelsbad 
monsieur gustave 
my name is henckels 
i m the son of dr  and mrs 
wolfgang henckels bergersdörfer 
do you remember me 
i know exactly who you are  it s uncanny 
you re little albert 
i m terribly embarrassed 
release them 
release them 
hmm 
your colleague is stateless 
he ll need to apply for a
revised special transit permit 
which at this point may be
very difficult to acquire 
take this 
it s temporary
but it s the best
i can offer  i m afraid 
and how s your wonderful mother 
she s very well  thank you 
i adore her 
send my love 
i will 
your companion
was very kind to me
when i was a lonely little boy 
my men and i apologize
for disturbing you 
i beg your pardon  sir 
 train door closes 
 train chugging 
you see  there are still faint
glimmers of civilization
left in this barbaric
slaughterhouse
that was once known as humanity 
indeed  that s what we provide
in our own modest 
humble  insignificant   
oh  fuck it 
where is she  clotilde 
take me to her 
you re looking so well  darling 
you really are 
they ve done a marvelous job 
i don t know what sort of cream
they ve put on you
down at the morgue 
but i want some 
honestly  you look better
than you have in years 
you look like you re alive 
oh  you changed it after all 
it s perfect 
clotilde 
oui  monsieur gustave 
a glass of chilled water
with no ice  please 
yes  m  gustave   
   and  also  m  serge would like to speak with you
privately in his office  please 
oh 
all right  then 
i shan t be long  darling 
mr  moustafa  we were escorted
through a green baize door 
down a narrow service corridor
and into the butler s pantry 
a moment later 
the kitchen passage swung open
and a small servant dressed in
white jolted into the room 
i ve never forgotten
the look on that man s face 
what the devil is going on 
i  myself 
had never set foot inside
a house of this kind in my life 
i understood very little about
the events that were to follow 
but  eventually 
i came to recognize 
when the destiny of a great
fortune is at stake 
men s greed spreads like a
poison in the bloodstream 
uncles  nephews  cousins 
in laws of increasingly
tenuous connection 
the old woman s
most distant relations
had come foraging
out of the woodwork 
at the head of
this congregation 
it was
a disorienting coincidence 
we discovered our
own deputy kovacs 
himself an important attorney 
of course 
he was the executor
of the dead widow s estate 
this is madame d s
last will and testament 
it consists of a general tontine
drawn up before the event of her
husband s death 46 years ago 
in combination
with 635 amendments 
notations  corrections 
and letters of wishes
executed during
the subsequent decades 
the ultimate legality
of this accumulation
requires further analysis 
but in the opinion of this office 
it was madame d s intention
that control of the
vast bulk of her estate
should be transferred 
forthwith  to her son  dmitri 
with special allowances
for his sisters 
marguerite  laetizia 
and carolina 
and minor gifts for various
members of the extended family
as shown in
the list of recipients 
which i will elucidate
in due course 
 all murmuring 
however 
an additional codicil 
delivered into my possession
by post only this morning 
and  by all indications 
sent by madame d
during the last
hours of her life 
contains an amendment
to the original certificate 
which  as prescribed by law 
i will read to you now 
the authenticity
of this document
has not yet been confirmed
by the presiding magistrate 
so i ask that all parties be
patient and refrain from comment
until such time as our
investigations can be completed 
 to my esteemed friend who
comforted me in my later years
and brought sunshine
into the life of an old woman
who thought that she
would never be happy again  
 monsieur gustave h 
i bequeath  bestow and
devise  free of all taxation
and with full and absolute
fiduciary entitlement 
the painting known
as  boy with apple     
wow 
    by johannes van hoytl    
i can t believe it 
    the younger    
what 
    which gave us
both so much pleasure  
the van hoytl 
tax free 
can she do that 
who s gustave h 
i m afraid that s me  darling 
that fucking faggot 
he s a concierge 
what are you doing here 
i ve come to pay my respects
to a great woman whom i loved 
this man is an intruder
in my home 
it s not yours yet  dmitri 
only when probate is granted 
and the deed of entitlement   
you re not getting boy with
apple  you goddamn little fruit 
how s that supposed
to make me feel 
call the police 
we re pressing charges 
this criminal has plagued my
family for nearly 20 years 
he s a ruthless adventurer
and a con artist
who preys on mentally feeble 
sick old ladies 
and he probably fucks them  too 
i go to bed with all my friends 
 crowd exclaims 
 crowd exclaims louder 
 crowd shrieks 
where s céline 
 spits drink  what 
she s dead 
we re reading her will 
oh  yes  yes  of course 
if i learn you ever once laid
a finger on my mother s body 
living or dead  i swear to god 
i ll cut your throat 
you hear me 
i thought i was supposed
to be a fucking faggot 
you are  but you re bisexual 
let s change the subject 
i m leaving 
wait here quietly  please 
that picture  boy with apple 
is priceless  understand 
congratulations 
monsieur gustave 
they re going to fight me
for the son of a bitch 
is it very beautiful 
beyond description 
 e en the most gifted bard s
rhyme can only sing
but to the lack of her
and all she isn t  
 his tongue doth    
can i see it 
i don t see why not 
this is van hoytl s
exquisite portrayal
of a beautiful boy
on the cusp of manhood 
blond  smooth  skin as
white as that milk 
of impeccable provenance 
one of the last in private hands 
and unquestionably  the best 
it s a masterpiece 
the rest of this shit
is worthless junk 
m  gustave 
can i help you 
yes  serge 
you can wrap this up  please 
wrap up   
wrap up     boy with apple  
what did you want
to tell me  before 
i think i cannot say right now 
write me tomorrow 
lutzbahn station 
i ll never part with it 
it reminded her of me  it will
remind me of her  always 
i ll die with this
picture above my bed 
see the resemblance 
oh  yes 
actually  we should sell it 
sooner rather than later  in
case they try to steal it back 
plus  something about
those lunatic
foot soldiers
on the express   
this could be a tricky war and a
long dry spell in the hotel trade 
for all we know  they could
board us up tomorrow 
let s make
a solemn blood pact 
we ll contact the black market
and liquidate boy with apple
by the end of the week 
then leave the country
and lay low
somewhere along
the maltese riviera
until the troubles blow over
and we resume our posts 
in exchange for
your help  your loyalty
and your services
as my personal valet 
i pledge to you 1 5 
of the net sale price 
1 5 
plus room and board 
could we make it 10 
10  are you joking 
that s more than
i d pay an actual dealer 
and you wouldn t know chiaroscuro
from chicken giblets 
no  1 5 is correct 
but i ll tell you what 
if i die first  and i most certainly
will  you will be my sole heir 
there s not much
in the kitty except
a set of ivory backed
hairbrushes
and my library of
romantic poetry 
but when the time comes 
these will be yours 
along with whatever we haven t
already spent on whores and whiskey 
this is our sacred bond 
i ll draw it up right now 
i  monsieur gustave h  being of
relatively sound mind and body 
on this day 
the 19th of october 
in the year of our lord 1932   
mr  moustafa  he never told
me where he came from 
i never asked who
his family had been 
excuse me 
uh huh 
the police are here 
they asked for you 
tell them i ll be right down 
okay 
have you ever been questioned
by the authorities 
yes  on one occasion
i was arrested
and tortured by
the rebel militia
after the desert uprising 
you know the drill  then  zip it 
of course 
you ve never heard the word  van
hoytl  in your life  okay  let s go 
how may we serve you  gentlemen 
ah  inspector henckels 
 by order of the commissioner
of police  zubrowka province 
i hereby place you under
arrest for the murder
of madame céline villeneuve
desgoffe und taxis  
i knew there was
something fishy 
we never got the cause of death 
she s been murdered
and you think i did it 
henckels  hey 
stop 
 door banging 
 man whistles 
what happened 
what happened  my dear zero 
is i beat the living shit
out of a sniveling little runt
called pinky bandinski
who had the gall to
question my virility 
because if there s one thing we ve
learned from penny dreadfuls 
it s that  when you find
yourself in a place like this 
you must never
be a candy ass 
you ve got to prove
yourself from day one 
you ve got to win their respect 
you should take a long look
at his ugly mug this morning 
he s  actually 
become a dear friend 
you ll meet him  i hope 
so  you ve talked to kovacs 
i saw him last night in secret 
he made me take an oath on a
bible i wouldn t tell a soul 
you re supposed to also 
i ll do that later 
he suspects you re innocent 
of course he does 
what s the charge 
in the small hours of
the evening of 19 october 
an individual well known to the house
and staff  a monsieur gustave h 
did arrive at the desgoffe
und taxis residence in lutz
and entered by
the rear service alley 
alerting no one to his presence 
and did then proceed by way of
back stairs and servants  passage 
to deliver himself into the
private chambers of madame d 
there is no evidence
to indicate whether this visit
had been pre arranged
with her or not 
the next morning madame d was found
dead by strychnine poisoning 
monsieur gustave was not
observed on the premises again
until  of course 
24 hours later 
the identity of
his accusers is made
clear in this
notarized deposition 
they include  essentially  all
members of the extended family 
but the key witness who actually
ostensibly saw the alleged events
appears to have
fled the jurisdiction 
his whereabouts are
currently unknown 
but he s being sought and pursued
by the relevant authorities 
who is he 
serge 
i m afraid so 
that little prick 
no  i don t believe it 
they put him up to it 
i ve been dropped
into a nest of vipers 
you have an alibi 
of course  but she s married
to the duke of westphalia 
i can t allow her name to get
mixed up in all this monkey business 
your life may be at stake 
i know  but the bitch legged it 
she s already on board the queen
nasstasja halfway to dutch tanganyika 
don t give up 
mr  moustafa  the details of the conspiracy 
now a matter of public record 
were  at that time  impossible
for us to apprehend 
 unlocking 
i m looking for serge x 
a young man in
the service of my employer 
the family desgoffe und taxis
of schloss lutz 
yes  sir 
you re his sister 
yes  sir 
seen him lately 
no  sir 
no  sir 
no  sir 
i need to find him right away 
for his own safety
and everybody else s 
if he shows up   
yes  sir 
tell him jopling says 
 come home  
mr  moustafa  but one thing was certain 
the desgoffe und taxis
were a very powerful family 
and time was not on our side 
 overlapping chatter 
 knocking 
a letter from
monsieur gustave  zero 
you want me to 
read it 
 clears throat 
 my dear and
trusted colleagues    
i miss you deeply
as i write from the confines
of my regrettable and
preposterous incarceration 
until i walk amongst
you again as a free man 
the grand budapest
remains in your hands 
as does its
impeccable reputation 
keep it spotless and glorify it 
take extra special care of
every little bitty bit of it
as if i were watching
over you like a hawk
with a horse whip in its
talons  because i am 
should i discover a lapse of
any variety during my absence 
i promise  swift and merciless
justice will descend upon you 
a great and noble house has been
placed under your protection 
tell zero if you see
any funny business 
 your devoted
monsieur gustave  
then there s a poem  but we
might want to start on the soup
since it s 46 stanzas 
 cutlery clatters 
 a moist  black ash dampens the
filth of a dung dark rat s nest
and mingles with
the thick scent of wood rot
while the lark song
of a guttersnipe    
jopling  i never
trusted that butler 
he s too honest 
dmitri on phone  too honest  you say 
jopling  mmm hmm 
right  well  be that as it may 
find him quick
and make it snappy 
may i offer any of you
inmates a plate of mush 
no  anyone 
you with the very
large scar on your face 
try it  it s actually quite warm
and nourishing this morning 
it needs a dash of salt 
good day 
mush  gents 
any takers 
suit yourselves 
rise and shine 
chop  chop 
good morning  pinky 
mendl s again 
precisely 
who s got the throat slitter 
out of this world 
gustave h  mendi s is the best 
well  back to work 
monsieur gustave 
yes 
 door closes 
pinky  me and the boys
talked it over 
we think you re
a really straight fellow 
well  i ve never been
accused of that before 
but i appreciate the sentiment 
you re one of us now 
what a lovely thing to say 
thank you  dear pinky 
thank you  günther 
thank you  wolf 
anything else 
tell him  ludwig 
checkpoint 19 ain t
no two bit hoosegow 
you got broad gauge iron bars
on every door  vent and window 
you got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers 
you got a 325 foot drop into
a moat full of crocodiles 
but  like the best of them 
it s got a soft spot 
which in this case
happens to take the form
of a storm drain sewer system
dating from the time of the
original rock fortification
way back in the middle ages 
now  nobody s saying it s a stroll
down a tree lined promenade
with a fine lady
and a white poodle 
but it s got what
you d call  vulnerability  
and that s our bread and butter 
take a look 
who drew this 
what do you mean 
 who drew this   i did 
very good  you ve got
a wonderful line  ludwig 
this shows great
artistic promise 
question  how do you intend to
penetrate this lowest rudiment 
it s 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry  is it not 
digging with
the throat slitter 
i expect this would take three to
six months of continual effort 
during which time
several of our members
will have been
violently executed 
you hit the nail on the head 
mr  gustave 
we got fake documents 
second hand street clothes 
a rope ladder made of
sticks and bunk linens 
but we need digging tools 
which are proving hard to
come by in this flop house 
young writer  at this point in the story 
the old man fell silent and
pushed away his saddle of lamb 
his eyes went
blank as two stones 
i could see he was in distress 
are you ill 
mr  moustafa 
i finally asked 
oh  dear me  no 
he said 
it s only that i don t
know how to proceed 
he was crying 
you see 
i never speak of agatha 
because even at
the thought of her name
i m unable to
control my emotions 
well  i suppose
there s no way around it 
you see  she saved us 
on our third formal rendezvous 
i had asked for her hand in
marriage and she had agreed 
will you marry me 
yes 
we did not have 50 klubecks
between the two of us 
no one knew  of course  but 
then  who would have cared 
we were each completely
on our own in the world 
and we were deeply in love 
here 
thank you 
it s a book 
i see 
romantic poetry  volume one 
monsieur gustave recommended it 
i have a copy of my own as well 
i ruined the surprise 
i suppose 
i ll go ahead
and open it  anyway 
read the inscription 
 reading 
mr  moustafa  monsieur gustave insisted
on an immediate and thorough
cross examination   
she s charming 
she s so charming 
 chuckles 
   during which he presented
agatha with a porcelain pendant
and five dozen individually
tissue wrapped white tulips
in a box the size
of a child s coffin 
it s not right 
i beg your pardon 
why is he sulking 
she s my girlfriend 
you can t just buy her things 
i m only interviewing this vision
of loveliness on your behalf 
never be jealous in this life 
zero  not even for an instant 
is he flirting with you 
yes 
i approve of this union 
agatha  my beauty 
return to your beloved 
mr  moustafa  soon we learned   
gustave h  blessings upon you both 
   not only was agatha
immensely skilled
with a palette knife and
a butter cream flourish   
mendl 
go 
   she was also very brave 
i believe she was born that way 
something s missing 
a crucial document  either misplaced
or  conceivably  destroyed 
i don t know what it contains  i
don t know what it represents 
i don t know what it is 
but there are traces
and shadows of it everywhere 
now  i don t want to alarm you 
and i don t expect to see
any significant change
in the magistrate s
ultimate decision
vis à vis your
own inheritance 
but  especially given the
circumstances of the death 
as well as the disappearance
of the key witness
in the murder case  serge x 
i suggest that we immediately
bring this matter
to the attention of
the municipal inspector
so that there can be
absolutely no question
of impropriety
at any future date 
agreed 
not agreed 
not agreed 
not agreed 
can i ask you a question 
vilmos 
yes  dmitri 
who are you working for 
i beg your pardon 
who are you working for 
i thought you re supposed
to be our lawyer 
well  in point of fact 
i m the executor of the estate 
in this particular situation 
i represent the deceased 
oh  yeah 
yeah  a provision for my fees
was included in the   
just wrap it up and
don t make waves  agreed 
i m an attorney 
i m obligated to
proceed according
to the rule of law 
not agreed 
this stinks  sisters 
 cat yowls 
did he just throw
my cat out the window 
i don t think so 
no  did he 
jopling 
 faint scraping

shh shh 
 guard sneezes and walks off 
ludwig  okay 
there s something
i haven t told you  agatha 
okay 
we stole a painting 
it s very valuable  maybe five
million klubecks  in fact 
i don t know if anyone s
even noticed it s missing yet 
but if something
should happen to me   
you steal art 
one picture  anyway  we need to
make a plan for your survival 
hide this  it s in code and you might
need a magnifying glass to read it 
but it tells you exactly where
and how to find boy with apple 
don t take less than half the
retail asking price  also   
zero  i m a baker 
you re a pastry chef 
i m not a fence

i don t trade in
stolen property

mr  moustafa  the next morning 
herr becker received a peculiar 
last minute notice from the
office of deputy kovacs 
postponing their scheduled
meeting  in perpetuity

good evening

let me introduce you  pinky  wolf 
ludwig  this is the divine zero 
gunther was slain
in the catacombs 
well  boys  who knows when we ll

 car approaches  hold it 
no time to gab 
take care of yourself 
mr  gustave 
good luck  kid 
which way to the safe house 
i couldn t find one 
no safe house  really  we re
completely on our own out here 
i m afraid so  i asked around  but   
 mumbles indistinctly 
gustave h  i understand  too risky 
we ll just have to wing it  i suppose 
let s put on our disguises 
we re wearing them 
no  we re not 
we said false whiskers
and fake noses and so on 
you didn t bring any 
i thought you were growing one 
and it wouldn t look
realistic  would it 
no  when done properly 
they re perfectly convincing 
but i take your point 
so be it 
give me a few squirts of l air
de panache  please  will you 
can i not get a squirt  even 
i forgot the l air de panache 
honestly  you forgot
the l air de panache 
i don t believe it 
how could you 
i ve been in jail  zero  do you
understand how humiliating this is 
i smell 
 chuckles  that s just
marvelous  isn t it 
i suppose this is to
be expected back in   
where do you come from again 
aq salim al jabat 
precisely 
i suppose this is to be expected
back in aq salim al jabat
where one s prized possessions
are a stack of filthy carpets
and a starving goat 
and one sleeps behind a tent flap and
survives on wild dates and scarabs 
but it s not how i trained you 
what on god s earth
possessed you to leave
the homeland where
you obviously belong
and travel unspeakable distances
to become a penniless immigrant in a
refined  highly cultivated society
that  quite frankly  could ve
gotten along very well without you 
the war 
say again 
well  you see 
my father was murdered
and the rest of my family
were executed by firing squad 
our village was
burned to the ground
and those who managed to
survive were forced to flee 
i left because of the war 
i see  so you re  actually  really
more of a refugee  in that sense 
truly 
well  i suppose i d better take
back everything i just said 
what a bloody idiot i am 
pathetic fool 
goddamn  selfish bastard 
this is disgraceful  and it s beneath
the standards of the grand budapest 
i apologize on
behalf of the hotel 
it s not your fault  you were
just upset i forgot the perfume 
don t make excuses for me 
i owe you my life 
you are my dear friend and protégé
and i m very proud of you 
you must know that 
i m so sorry  zero 
we re brothers 
how s our darling agatha 
  twas first light when i saw
her face upon the heath 
and hence did i return 
day by day  entranced 
tho  vinegar did brine my
heart  never      alarm blares 
very good  i m going to stop you
there because the alarm has sounded 
but remember where we left off
because i insist you finish later 
 police whistle blows

are you fucking kidding me 
clotilde  excusez moi 
i believe it was removed
by monsieur gustave 
i m not angry with serge 
you can t blame someone for their
basic lack of moral fiber 
he s a frightened  little 
yellow bellied coward 
it s not his fault  is it  i don t know 
it depends 
well  you can say that
about most anything 
 it depends  
of course it depends 
of course it depends 
of course it depends

of course it depends 
that doesn t mean i m not going
to throttle the little swamp rat 
may i officiate  by the way 
the ceremony 
with pleasure 
i must say  i find that
girl utterly delightful 
flat as a board 
enormous birthmark
the shape of mexico
over half her face 
sweating for hours on end
in that sweltering kitchen
while mendl 
genius though he is 
looms over her like
a hulking gorilla 
yet without question 
without fail 
always and invariably 
she s exceedingly lovely 
why 
because of her purity 
she admires you as well 
monsieur gustave 
does she 
very much 
that s a good sign  you know 
it means she  gets it  
that s important 
don t flirt with her

agatha 
are you all right 
i think so 
something s on
the back of the picture 
 people murmuring 
mr  moustafa  she left everything
to monsieur gustave  of course 
the mansion 
known as schloss lutz 
the factories  which produced
weapons  medicine and textiles 
 all laughing 
an important
newspaper syndicate 
and perhaps
you ve already deduced
this very institution 
the grand budapest hotel 
he anointed me his successor 
and as the war continued 
i served my adopted country
from the narrow desk still found
against the wall in the next room 
 indistinct 
he was the same
as his disciples 
insecure  vain 
superficial  blond  needy 
in the end he was even rich 
he did not succeed  however 
in growing old 
 dearly beloved 
we are gathered together    
mr  moustafa  nor did my darling agatha 
she and our infant son would
be killed two years later
by the prussian grippe 
an absurd little disease 
today we treat it
in a single week 
but  in those days
many millions died 
on the 21st day
of the occupation 
the morning the independent
state of zubrowka
officially ceased to exist 
we traveled with
monsieur gustave to lutz 
in answer to your earlier
question  by the way 
of course 
zero asked me about my humble
beginnings in the hotel trade 
i was  perhaps  for a time 
considered the best lobby boy
we d ever had at
the grand budapest 
i think i can say that 
this one finally surpassed me 
although  i must say 
he had an exceptional teacher 
truly 
 whence came these two
radiant  celestial brothers 
united  for an instant 
as they crossed the stratosphere
of our starry window  
 one from the east
and one from the west  
very good 
don t flirt with her 
 brakes screeching 
why are we stopping
at a barley field again 
i find these black
uniforms very drab 
well  hello there  chaps 
we were just talking about you 
documents  please 
with pleasure  as always 
you re the first of
the official death squads
to whom we ve been
formally introduced 
how do you do 
plus ça change  am i right 
uh  that s a migratory visa with
stage three worker status  darling 
read this 
soldier  come outside 
gustave h  now  stay there 
i give you my word  if you
lay a finger on this man 
i ll see you
dishonorably discharged 
locked up in the stockade
and hanged by sundown 
mr  moustafa  there are still
faint glimmers of civilization
left in this
barbaric slaughterhouse
that was once known as humanity 
 shrieks 
you filthy  goddamn 
pock marked  fascist assholes 
mr  moustafa  he was one of them 
what more is there to say 
what happened in the end 
in the end they shot him 
so it all went to me 
young writer  after dinner  we went
to collect the keys to our rooms 
but monsieur jean
had abandoned his post 
i expect he s forgotten
all about us 
young writer  in recent years  of course 
such properties and holdings
as the grand budapest
had with very few exceptions
become common property 
while the precise terms
of his negotiation
with the new government
had never been announced 
the result was an open secret 
zero moustafa had traded
a great and important fortune
in exchange for one costly 
unprofitable  doomed hotel 
why 
was it merely sentimental 
it was quite forward of me
and a bit out of character 
but i felt i must know 
for my health  i suppose 
forgive me for asking 
i hope i haven t upset you 
no  of course not 
is it simply your last connection
to that vanished world 
his world  if you will 
his world 
no  i don t think so 
you see  we shared a vocation 
it wouldn t have been necessary 
no  the hotel
i keep for agatha 
we were happy here 
for a little while 
 elevator bell dings 
to be frank  i think
his world had vanished
long before he ever entered it 
but  i will say 
he certainly sustained the
illusion with a marvelous grace 
are you going up 
no  i ll sit for a little while 
good night 
 elevator bell dings 
young writer  the next week 
i sailed for a cure
in south america
and began a long 
wandering journey abroad
