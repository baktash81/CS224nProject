imagination is always at work
that hes constantly
inventing an endless supply
of incidents and episodes
that he simply dreams up
his stories out of thin air
in point of fact
the opposite is true
once the public
knows youre a writer
they bring the characters
and events to you
and as long as you maintain
your ability to look
and to carefully listen
door opens
these stories
will continue to
stop it stop it dont dont do it
toy gun clicks
pellet clatters
footsteps recede
uh will continue to seek
you out over your lifetime
to him who has often
told the tales of others
many tales will be told
sorry
its all right
the incidents that follow
were described to me
exactly as i present them here
and in a wholly unexpected way
a number of years ago
while suffering from a mild
case of scribes fever
a form of neurasthenia
common among
the intelligentsia of that time
i decided to spend
the month of august
in the spa town of nebelsbad
below the alpine sudetenwaltz
and had taken up rooms
in the grand budapest
a picturesque elaborate and once
widely celebrated establishment
i expect some of
you will know it
young writer it was off season and by
that time decidedly out of fashion
and it had already
begun its descent
into shabbiness and
eventual demolition
what few guests we were
had quickly come to recognize
one another by sight
as the only living souls residing
in the vast establishment
coins clinking
although i do not believe any acquaintance
among our number had proceeded
beyond the polite nods
we exchanged as we passed
in the palm court
in the arabian baths
and on board
the colonnade funicular
we were a very reserved
group it seemed
and without exception
solitary
perhaps as a result of
this general silence
i had established a casual
and bantering familiarity
with the hotels concierge
a westcontinental
known only as monsieur jean
who struck one
as being at once
both lazy and really
quite accommodating
i expect he was not well paid
in any case one evening
as i stood conferring
elbowtoelbow with monsieur jean
as had become my habit i noticed
a new presence in our company
a small elderly man
smartly dressed
with an exceptionally lively
intelligent face
and an immediately perceptible
air of sadness
he was like the rest of us
alone but also i must say
he was the first that struck one
as being deeply and truly lonely
a symptom of my own
medical condition as well
whos this interesting
old fellow
i inquired of monsieur jean
to my surprise
he was distinctly taken aback
dont you know
he asked
dont you recognize him
he did look familiar
thats mr moustafa himself
he arrived earlier this morning
this name will no
doubt be familiar
to the more seasoned
persons among you
mr zero moustafa was at one time
the richest man in zubrowka
and was still indeed the owner
of the grand budapest
he often comes and
stays a week or more
three times a year at least
but never in the season
monsieur jean signaled to me
and i leaned closer
ill tell you a secret
he takes only a singlebed
sleeping room without a bath
in the rear corner
of the top floor
and its smaller than
the service elevator
it was well known
zero moustafa had purchased
and famously inhabited
some of the most lavish castles
and palazzos on the continent
yet here in his own
nearly empty hotel
he occupied
a servants quarters
at that moment the curtain rose
on a parenthetical
domestic drama
shit
which required the immediate
and complete attention
of monsieur jean dog barking
but frankly
did not hold mine for long
elevator bell dings
however
this premature intermission in the
story of the curious old man
had left me
as the expression goes
gespannt wie ein flitzebogen
that is on the edge of my seat
where i remained throughout
the next morning until
in what i have found to be its
mysterious and utterly reliable fashion
fate once again
intervened on my behalf
mr moustafa i admire your work
i beg your pardon
i said i know and admire
your wonderful work
thank you most kindly sir
did monsieur jean have a word
or two to share with you
about the aged proprietor
of this establishment
i must confess i did
myself inquire about you
hes perfectly capable
of course monsieur jean
but we cant claim hes a first
or in earnest
even secondrate concierge
but there it is
times have changed
the thermal baths
are very beautiful
they were in their
first condition
it couldnt be maintained
of course
too decadent for current tastes
but i love it all just the same
this enchanting old ruin
how did you come to
buy it if i may ask
the grand budapest
unplugs drain
i didnt
water running
man yelling
yelling stops
if youre not
merely being polite
and you must tell me
if thats the case
but if it genuinely
does interest you
may i invite you to
dine with me tonight
and it will be my pleasure and
indeed my privilege to tell you
my story
such as it is
ordering food indistinct
two ducks roasted with olives
rabbit salad
mmm
pouillyjouvet 52
plus a split of the brut
that should
provide us ample time
if i commence promptly
by all means
chuckling
well it begins as it must with
our mutual friends predecessor
the beloved original concierge
of the grand budapest
it begins of course with
knock on door
bring the table to the window
yes monsieur gustave
bring the tray to the table
right away monsieur gustave
right there have those
been brushed and blocked
of course monsieur gustave
pack them in the hat boxes
is that from
oberstdorf  company
i believe so monsieur gustave
second trunk who has the tickets
i do monsieur gustave
give them to me
these are in order
wait in the corner
im not leaving
i beg your pardon
im not leaving
why not
im frightened
of what
i fear this may be the last
time we ever see each other
why on earth would
that be the case
well i cant put it
into words but i feel it
for goodness sake
theres no reason
for you to leave us if youd
come with me
to fucking lutz
please
give me your hand
youve nothing to fear youre
always anxious before you travel
i admit you appear
to be suffering
a more acute attack
on this occasion
but truly and honestly
oh dear god
what have you done
to your fingernails
i beg your pardon this
diabolical varnish
the color is completely wrong
dont you like it
its not that i dont like it
i am physically repulsed
perhaps this will soothe you
what dont recite
just listen to
the words hush
please not now
while questing once in noble
wood of gray medieval pine
i came upon a tomb rainslickd
rubbedcool ethereal
its inscription
longvanished
yet still within its
melancholy fissures
madame d will you light
a candle for me please
in the sacristy of santa maria
gustave h ill see to it
myself immediately
remember im always with you
i love you
i love you
speaks german
its quite a thing winning the
loyalty of a woman like that
for 19 consecutive seasons
um yes sir
shes very fond of me you know
yes sir
but ive never seen
her like that before
no sir
she was shaking
like a shitting dog
truly
run to the cathedral of santa
maria in brucknerplatz
buy one of the plain
halflength candles
and take back four
klubecks in change
light it in the sacristy
say a brief rosary
then go to mendis and get me
a courtesan au chocolat
if theres any money left give it
to the crippled shoeshine boy
right away sir
hold it
who are you
im zero sir
the new lobby boy
zero you say
yes sir
ive never heard of you
never laid eyes on you
who hired you
mr mosher sir
mr mosher
yes monsieur gustave
am i to understand youve
surreptitiously hired this young man
in the position of a lobby boy
hes been engaged
for a trial period
pending your approval
of course
uh
perhaps yes
thank you mr mosher
youre most welcome
monsieur gustave
youre now going to be
officially interviewed
should i go and light
the candle first sir
what no
experience
hotel kinski
kitchen boy six months
hotel berlitz mop and
broom boy three months
before that i was
a skillet scrubber
experience zero
thank you again
monsieur gustave
straighten that cap anatole
the pleasures mine herr schneider
the straps busted
these are not acceptable
i fully agree
education
i studied reading and spelling
i started my primary school
i almost
education zero
now its exploded
good morning cicero
call the goddamn plumber
this afternoon
monsieur gustave
without fail frau liebling
what in hell is this not now
family
zero
six igor
why do you want
to be a lobby boy
well who wouldnt
at the grand budapest sir
its an institution
very good
a thousand klubecks
my goodness
were you ever a lobby boy sir
what do you think
well i suppose youd have
to start somewhere
go and light the goddamn candle
yes sir
mr moustafa and so my life began
junior lobby boy intraining
grand budapest hotel
under the strict command
of monsieur gustave h
i became his pupil and he was
to be my counselor and guardian
gustave h what is a lobby boy
a lobby boys completely
invisible yet always in sight
a lobby boy remembers
what people hate
a lobby boy anticipates
the clients needs
before the needs are needed
a lobby boy is above all
discreet to a fault
our guests know
their deepest secrets
some of which are
frankly rather unseemly
will go with us to our graves
so keep your mouth shut zero
yes sir
thats all for now
mr moustafa i began to realize
that many of the hotels
most valued and distinguished
guests came for him
it seemed to be an essential
pan of his duties
ah laughs
but i believe it
was also his pleasure
the requirements
were always the same
they had to be rich
old
insecure
vain
superficial
blonde
needy
why blonde
because they all were
he was by the way
the most liberally perfumed
man i had ever encountered
the scent announced his
approach from a great distance
and lingered for many minutes
after he was gone
man sniffing
i worked six days each week
plus a halfday sunday
500 am until
just after midnight
our meals were small but
frequent for stamina
two breakfasts two lunches
and a late supper
monsieur gustave also
delivered a nightly sermon
rudeness is merely
the expression of fear
people fear they
wont get what they want
the most dreadful and unattractive
person only needs to be loved
and they will open
up like a flower
i am reminded of a verse
the painters brush
touched the inchoate face
by ends of nimble bristles
and with their
blush of first color
rendered her
lifeless cheek living
mr moustafa his own dinner
he took alone in his room
the identity of the owner of the
hotel was unknown to all of us
each month his emissary known
as deputy kovacs arrived
to review the books
and convey messages
on behalf of
the mysterious proprietor
on these occasions monsieur
gustave and our business manager
herr becker met with him in private
consultation above reception
inaudible
this was also when i met agatha
but we wont discuss that
door opening
what do you want
look
gustave h dear god
im terribly sorry sir
we must go to her
we must
tout de suite
she needs me and i need
you to help me with
my bags and so on
woman and gustave h
speaking french
how fast can you pack
five minutes
do it and bring a bottle
of the pouillyjouvet 26
in an ice bucket
with two glasses
so we dont have to drink the cat
piss they serve in the dining car
i blame myself
she tried to tell me she had a premonition
i didnt listen
all of lutz will
be dressed in black
except her own ghastly
deceitful children
whom she loathed and
couldnt bear to kiss hello
theyll be dancing like gypsies
theres really no point
in doing anything in life
because its all over
in the blink of an eye
and the next thing you know
rigor mortis sets in
oh how the good die young
with any luck shes left a few
klubecks for your old friend
but one never knows
until the ink
is dry on the death certificate
she was dynamite in the sack
by the way
she was 84 monsieur gustave
ive had older
when youre young
its all fillet steak
but as the years go by you have
to move on to the cheaper cuts
which is fine with me
because i like those
more flavorful or so they say
brakes screeching
why are we stopping
at a barley field
well hello there chaps
documents please
with pleasure
its not a very flattering
portrait im afraid
i was once considered
a great beauty
what does the f stand for
fritz franz
franz
i knew it
hes making a funny face
thats a migratory visa with stage
three worker status franz darling
hes with me
come outside please
now wait a minute sit down zero
his papers are in order
i crossreferenced
them myself with
the bureau of
labor and servitude
you cant arrest him simply
because hes a bloody immigrant
he hasnt done anything wrong
stop it damn you
never mind monsieur gustave
let them proceed
gustave h ow that hurts
groaning
you filthy goddamn
pockmarked fascist assholes
take your hands
off my lobby boy
whistle tooting
door opens
whats the problem
this is outrageous
the young man works for me at the
grand budapest hotel in nebelsbad
monsieur gustave
my name is henckels
im the son of dr and mrs
wolfgang henckelsbergersdörfer
do you remember me
i know exactly who you are its uncanny
youre little albert
im terribly embarrassed
release them
release them
hmm
your colleague is stateless
hell need to apply for a
revised special transit permit
which at this point may be
very difficult to acquire
take this
its temporary
but its the best
i can offer im afraid
and hows your wonderful mother
shes very well thank you
i adore her
send my love
i will
your companion
was very kind to me
when i was a lonely little boy
my men and i apologize
for disturbing you
i beg your pardon sir
train door closes
train chugging
you see there are still faint
glimmers of civilization
left in this barbaric
slaughterhouse
that was once known as humanity
indeed thats what we provide
in our own modest
humble insignificant
oh fuck it
where is she clotilde
take me to her
youre looking so well darling
you really are
theyve done a marvelous job
i dont know what sort of cream
theyve put on you
down at the morgue
but i want some
honestly you look better
than you have in years
you look like youre alive
oh you changed it after all
its perfect
clotilde
oui monsieur gustave
a glass of chilled water
with no ice please
yes m gustave
and also m serge would like to speak with you
privately in his office please
oh
all right then
i shant be long darling
mr moustafa we were escorted
through a green baize door
down a narrow service corridor
and into the butlers pantry
a moment later
the kitchen passage swung open
and a small servant dressed in
white jolted into the room
ive never forgotten
the look on that mans face
what the devil is going on
i myself
had never set foot inside
a house of this kind in my life
i understood very little about
the events that were to follow
but eventually
i came to recognize
when the destiny of a great
fortune is at stake
mens greed spreads like a
poison in the bloodstream
uncles nephews cousins
inlaws of increasingly
tenuous connection
the old womans
most distant relations
had come foraging
out of the woodwork
at the head of
this congregation
it was
a disorienting coincidence
we discovered our
own deputy kovacs
himself an important attorney
of course
he was the executor
of the dead widows estate
this is madame ds
last will and testament
it consists of a general tontine
drawn up before the event of her
husbands death 46 years ago
in combination
with 635 amendments
notations corrections
and letters of wishes
executed during
the subsequent decades
the ultimate legality
of this accumulation
requires further analysis
but in the opinion of this office
it was madame ds intention
that control of the
vast bulk of her estate
should be transferred
forthwith to her son dmitri
with special allowances
for his sisters
marguerite laetizia
and carolina
and minor gifts for various
members of the extended family
as shown in
the list of recipients
which i will elucidate
in due course
all murmuring
however
an additional codicil
delivered into my possession
by post only this morning
and by all indications
sent by madame d
during the last
hours of her life
contains an amendment
to the original certificate
which as prescribed by law
i will read to you now
the authenticity
of this document
has not yet been confirmed
by the presiding magistrate
so i ask that all parties be
patient and refrain from comment
until such time as our
investigations can be completed
to my esteemed friend who
comforted me in my later years
and brought sunshine
into the life of an old woman
who thought that she
would never be happy again
monsieur gustave h
i bequeath bestow and
devise free of all taxation
and with full and absolute
fiduciary entitlement
the painting known
as boy with apple
wow
by johannes van hoytl
i cant believe it
the younger
what
which gave us
both so much pleasure
the van hoytl
taxfree
can she do that
whos gustave h
im afraid thats me darling
that fucking faggot
hes a concierge
what are you doing here
ive come to pay my respects
to a great woman whom i loved
this man is an intruder
in my home
its not yours yet dmitri
only when probate is granted
and the deed of entitlement
youre not getting boy with
apple you goddamn little fruit
hows that supposed
to make me feel
call the police
were pressing charges
this criminal has plagued my
family for nearly 20 years
hes a ruthless adventurer
and a conartist
who preys on mentally feeble
sick old ladies
and he probably fucks them too
i go to bed with all my friends
crowd exclaims
crowd exclaims louder
crowd shrieks
wheres céline
spits drink what
shes dead
were reading her will
oh yes yes of course
if i learn you ever once laid
a finger on my mothers body
living or dead i swear to god
ill cut your throat
you hear me
i thought i was supposed
to be a fucking faggot
you are but youre bisexual
lets change the subject
im leaving
wait here quietly please
that picture boy with apple
is priceless understand
congratulations
monsieur gustave
theyre going to fight me
for the son of a bitch
is it very beautiful
beyond description
een the most gifted bards
rhyme can only sing
but to the lack of her
and all she isnt
his tongue doth
can i see it
i dont see why not
this is van hoytls
exquisite portrayal
of a beautiful boy
on the cusp of manhood
blond smooth skin as
white as that milk
of impeccable provenance
one of the last in private hands
and unquestionably the best
its a masterpiece
the rest of this shit
is worthless junk
m gustave
can i help you
yes serge
you can wrap this up please
wrap up
wrap up boy with apple
what did you want
to tell me before
i think i cannot say right now
write me tomorrow
lutzbahn station
ill never part with it
it reminded her of me it will
remind me of her always
ill die with this
picture above my bed
see the resemblance
oh yes
actually we should sell it
sooner rather than later in
case they try to steal it back
plus something about
those lunatic
footsoldiers
on the express
this could be a tricky war and a
long dry spell in the hotel trade
for all we know they could
board us up tomorrow
lets make
a solemn bloodpact
well contact the black market
and liquidate boy with apple
by the end of the week
then leave the country
and lay low
somewhere along
the maltese riviera
until the troubles blow over
and we resume our posts
in exchange for
your help your loyalty
and your services
as my personal valet
i pledge to you 15
of the net sale price
plus room and board
could we make it 10
10 are you joking
thats more than
id pay an actual dealer
and you wouldnt know chiaroscuro
from chicken giblets
no 15 is correct
but ill tell you what
if i die first and i most certainly
will you will be my sole heir
theres not much
in the kitty except
a set of ivorybacked
hairbrushes
and my library of
romantic poetry
but when the time comes
these will be yours
along with whatever we havent
already spent on whores and whiskey
this is our sacred bond
ill draw it up right now
i monsieur gustave h being of
relatively sound mind and body
on this day
the 19th of october
in the year of our lord 1932
mr moustafa he never told
me where he came from
i never asked who
his family had been
excuse me
uhhuh
the police are here
they asked for you
tell them ill be right down
okay
have you ever been questioned
by the authorities
yes on one occasion
i was arrested
and tortured by
the rebel militia
after the desert uprising
you know the drill then zip it
of course
youve never heard the word van
hoytl in your life okay lets go
how may we serve you gentlemen
ah inspector henckels
by order of the commissioner
of police zubrowka province
i hereby place you under
arrest for the murder
of madame céline villeneuve
desgoffe und taxis
i knew there was
something fishy
we never got the cause of death
shes been murdered
and you think i did it
henckels hey
stop
door banging
man whistles
what happened
what happened my dear zero
is i beat the living shit
out of a sniveling little runt
called pinky bandinski
who had the gall to
question my virility
because if theres one thing weve
learned from penny dreadfuls
its that when you find
yourself in a place like this
you must never
be a candyass
youve got to prove
yourself from day one
youve got to win their respect
you should take a long look
at his ugly mug this morning
hes actually
become a dear friend
youll meet him i hope
so youve talked to kovacs
i saw him last night in secret
he made me take an oath on a
bible i wouldnt tell a soul
youre supposed to also
ill do that later
he suspects youre innocent
of course he does
whats the charge
in the small hours of
the evening of 19 october
an individual wellknown to the house
and staff a monsieur gustave h
did arrive at the desgoffe
und taxis residence in lutz
and entered by
the rear service alley
alerting no one to his presence
and did then proceed by way of
back stairs and servants passage
to deliver himself into the
private chambers of madame d
there is no evidence
to indicate whether this visit
had been prearranged
with her or not
the next morning madame d was found
dead by strychnine poisoning
monsieur gustave was not
observed on the premises again
until of course
24 hours later
the identity of
his accusers is made
clear in this
notarized deposition
they include essentially all
members of the extended family
but the key witness who actually
ostensibly saw the alleged events
appears to have
fled the jurisdiction
his whereabouts are
currently unknown
but hes being sought and pursued
by the relevant authorities
who is he
serge
im afraid so
that little prick
no i dont believe it
they put him up to it
ive been dropped
into a nest of vipers
you have an alibi
of course but shes married
to the duke of westphalia
i cant allow her name to get
mixedup in all this monkey business
your life may be at stake
i know but the bitch legged it
shes already on board the queen
nasstasja halfway to dutch tanganyika
dont give up
mr moustafa the details of the conspiracy
now a matter of public record
were at that time impossible
for us to apprehend
unlocking
im looking for serge x
a young man in
the service of my employer
the family desgoffe und taxis
of schloss lutz
yes sir
youre his sister
yes sir
seen him lately
no sir
no sir
no sir
i need to find him right away
for his own safety
and everybody elses
if he shows up
yes sir
tell him jopling says
come home
mr moustafa but one thing was certain
the desgoffe und taxis
were a very powerful family
and time was not on our side
overlapping chatter
knocking
a letter from
monsieur gustave zero
you want me to
read it
clears throat
my dear and
trusted colleagues
i miss you deeply
as i write from the confines
of my regrettable and
preposterous incarceration
until i walk amongst
you again as a free man
the grand budapest
remains in your hands
as does its
impeccable reputation
keep it spotless and glorify it
take extra special care of
every littlebitty bit of it
as if i were watching
over you like a hawk
with a horse whip in its
talons because i am
should i discover a lapse of
any variety during my absence
i promise swift and merciless
justice will descend upon you
a great and noble house has been
placed under your protection
tell zero if you see
any funny business
your devoted
monsieur gustave
then theres a poem but we
might want to start on the soup
since its 46 stanzas
cutlery clatters
a moist black ash dampens the
filth of a dungdark rats nest
and mingles with
the thick scent of wood rot
while the lark song
of a guttersnipe
jopling i never
trusted that butler
hes too honest
dmitri on phone too honest you say
jopling mmmhmm
right well be that as it may
find him quick
and make it snappy
may i offer any of you
inmates a plate of mush
no anyone
you with the very
large scar on your face
try it its actually quite warm
and nourishing this morning
it needs a dash of salt
good day
mush gents
any takers
suit yourselves
rise and shine
chop chop
good morning pinky
mendls again
precisely
whos got the throat slitter
out of this world
gustave h mendis is the best
well back to work
monsieur gustave
yes
door closes
pinky me and the boys
talked it over
we think youre
a really straight fellow
well ive never been
accused of that before
but i appreciate the sentiment
youre one of us now
what a lovely thing to say
thank you dear pinky
thank you günther
thank you wolf
anything else
tell him ludwig
checkpoint 19 aint
no twobit hoosegow
you got broadgauge iron bars
on every door vent and window
you got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers
you got a 325foot drop into
a moat full of crocodiles
but like the best of them
its got a soft spot
which in this case
happens to take the form
of a stormdrain sewer system
dating from the time of the
original rock fortification
way back in the middle ages
now nobodys saying its a stroll
down a treelined promenade
with a fine lady
and a white poodle
but its got what
youd call vulnerability
and thats our bread and butter
take a look
who drew this
what do you mean
who drew this i did
very good youve got
a wonderful line ludwig
this shows great
artistic promise
question how do you intend to
penetrate this lowest rudiment
its 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry is it not
digging with
the throatslitter
i expect this would take three to
six months of continual effort
during which time
several of our members
will have been
violently executed
you hit the nail on the head
mr gustave
we got fake documents
secondhand street clothes
a rope ladder made of
sticks and bunklinens
but we need digging tools
which are proving hard to
come by in this flophouse
young writer at this point in the story
the old man fell silent and
pushed away his saddle of lamb
his eyes went
blank as two stones
i could see he was in distress
are you ill
mr moustafa
i finally asked
oh dear me no
he said
its only that i dont
know how to proceed
he was crying
you see
i never speak of agatha
because even at
the thought of her name
im unable to
control my emotions
well i suppose
theres no way around it
you see she saved us
on our third formal rendezvous
i had asked for her hand in
marriage and she had agreed
will you marry me
yes
we did not have 50 klubecks
between the two of us
no one knew of course but
then who would have cared
we were each completely
on our own in the world
and we were deeply in love
here
thank you
its a book
i see
romantic poetry volume one
monsieur gustave recommended it
i have a copy of my own as well
i ruined the surprise
i suppose
ill go ahead
and open it anyway
read the inscription
reading
mr moustafa monsieur gustave insisted
on an immediate and thorough
crossexamination
shes charming
shes so charming
chuckles
during which he presented
agatha with a porcelain pendant
and five dozen individually
tissuewrapped white tulips
in a box the size
of a childs coffin
its not right
i beg your pardon
why is he sulking
shes my girlfriend
you cant just buy her things
im only interviewing this vision
of loveliness on your behalf
never be jealous in this life
zero not even for an instant
is he flirting with you
yes
i approve of this union
agatha my beauty
return to your beloved
mr moustafa soon we learned

somethings missing
a crucial document either misplaced
or conceivably destroyed
i dont know what it contains i
dont know what it represents
i dont know what it is
but there are traces
and shadows of it everywhere
now i dont want to alarm you
and i dont expect to see
any significant change
in the magistrates
ultimate decision
visàvis your
own inheritance
but especially given the
circumstances of the death
as well as the disappearance
of the key witness
in the murder case serge x
i suggest that we immediately
bring this matter
to the attention of
the municipal inspector
so that there can be
absolutely no question
of impropriety
at any future date

mr gustave
good luck kid
which way to the safe house
i couldnt find one
no safe house really were
completely on our own out here
im afraid so i asked around but
mumbles indistinctly
gustave h i understand too risky
well just have to wing it i suppose
lets put on our disguises
were wearing them
no were not
we said false whiskers
and fake noses and so on
you didnt bring any
i thought you were growing one
and it wouldnt look
realistic would it
no when done properly
theyre perfectly convincing
but i take your point
so be it
give me a few squirts of lair
de panache please will you
can i not get a squirt even
i forgot the lair de panache
honestly you forgot
the lair de panache
i dont believe it
how could you
ive been in jail zero do you
understand how humiliating this is
i smell
chuckles thats just
marvelous isnt it
i suppose this is to
be expected back in
where do you come from again
aq salim aljabat
precisely
i suppose this is to be expected
back in aq salim aljabat
where ones prized possessions
are a stack of filthy carpets
and a starving goat
and one sleeps behind a tent flap and
survives on wild dates and scarabs
but its not how i trained you
what on gods earth
possessed you to leave
the homeland where
you obviously belong
and travel unspeakable distances
to become a penniless immigrant in a
refined highlycultivated society
that quite frankly couldve
gotten along very well without you
the war
say again
well you see
my father was murdered
and the rest of my family
were executed by firing squad
our village was
burned to the ground
and those who managed to
survive were forced to flee
i left because of the war
i see so youre actually really
more of a refugee in that sense
truly
well i suppose id better take
back everything i just said
what a bloody idiot i am
pathetic fool
goddamn selfish bastard
this is disgraceful and its beneath
the standards of the grand budapest
i apologize on
behalf of the hotel
its not your fault you were
just upset i forgot the perfume
dont make excuses for me
i owe you my life
you are my dear friend and protégé
and im very proud of you

flat as a board
enormous birthmark
the shape of mexico
over half her face
sweating for hours on end
in that sweltering kitchen
while mendl
genius though he is
looms over her like
a hulking gorilla
yet without question
without fail
always and invariably
shes exceedingly lovely

because of her purity
she admires you as well
monsieur gustave
does she
very much
thats a good sign you know
it means she gets it
thats important
dont flirt with her

gustave h the beginning of the end of
the end of the beginning has begun
a sad finale played offkey
on a brokendown saloon piano
in the outskirts of
a forgotten ghost town
id rather not bear witness
to such blasphemy
me neither
the grand budapest
has become a troops barracks
i shall never cross its
threshold again in my lifetime
me neither
never again shall i
actually i think we might be going
in there right now after all

yep she just got on the elevator with mr
desgoffe und taxis

information of that kind
youre a stone wall
understood
pretty picture
sixth floor

murderer and art thief

desgoffe und taxis
hes responsible for the
killing of deputy kovacs
serge x and his clubfooted
sister plus his own mother
nobody move
everybodys under arrest
glass breaks

whos out the window
agatha
gunfire continues
310bis
hang on here i come
heavy gunfire
grunts
agatha somethings
on the back of the
both scream
thudding
agatha
agatha
are you all right
i think so
somethings on
the back of the picture
people murmuring
mr moustafa she left everything
to monsieur gustave of course
the mansion
known as schloss lutz
the factories which produced
weapons medicine and textiles
all laughing
an important
newspaper syndicate
and perhaps
youve already deduced
this very institution
the grand budapest hotel
he anointed me his successor
and as the war continued
i served my adopted country
from the narrow desk still found
against the wall in the next room
indistinct
he was the same
as his disciples
insecure vain
superficial blond needy
in the end he was even rich
he did not succeed however
in growing old
dearly beloved
we are gathered together
mr moustafa nor did my darling agatha
she and our infant son would
be killed two years later
by the prussian grippe
an absurd little disease
today we treat it
in a single week
but in those days
many millions died
on the 21st day
of the occupation
the morning the independent
state of zubrowka
officially ceased to exist
we traveled with
monsieur gustave to lutz
in answer to your earlier
question by the way
of course
zero asked me about my humble
beginnings in the hotel trade
i was perhaps for a time
considered the best lobby boy
wed ever had at
the grand budapest
i think i can say that
this one finally surpassed me
although i must say
he had an exceptional teacher
truly
whence came these two
radiant celestial brothers
united for an instant
as they crossed the stratosphere
of our starry window
one from the east
and one from the west
very good
dont flirt with her
brakes screeching
why are we stopping
at a barley field again
i find these black
uniforms very drab
well hello there chaps
we were just talking about you
documents please
with pleasure as always
youre the first of
the official death squads
to whom weve been
formally introduced
how do you do
plus ça change am i right
uh thats a migratory visa with
stage three worker status darling
read this
soldier come outside
gustave h now stay there
i give you my word if you
lay a finger on this man
ill see you
dishonorably discharged
locked up in the stockade
and hanged by sundown
mr moustafa there are still
faint glimmers of civilization
left in this
barbaric slaughterhouse
that was once known as humanity
shrieks
you filthy goddamn
pockmarked fascist assholes
mr moustafa he was one of them
what more is there to say
what happened in the end
in the end they shot him
so it all went to me
young writer after dinner we went
to collect the keys to our rooms
but monsieur jean
had abandoned his post
i expect hes forgotten
all about us
young writer in recent years of course
such properties and holdings
as the grand budapest
had with very few exceptions
become common property
while the precise terms
of his negotiation
with the new government
had never been announced
the result was an open secret
zero moustafa had traded
a great and important fortune
in exchange for one costly
unprofitable doomed hotel
why
was it merely sentimental
it was quite forward of me
and a bit out of character
but i felt i must know
for my health i suppose
forgive me for asking
i hope i havent upset you
no of course not
is it simply your last connection
to that vanished world
his world if you will
his world
no i dont think so
you see we shared a vocation
it wouldnt have been necessary
no the hotel
i keep for agatha
we were happy here
for a little while
elevator bell dings
to be frank i think
his world had vanished
long before he ever entered it
but i will say
he certainly sustained the
illusion with a marvelous grace
are you going up
no ill sit for a little while
good night
elevator bell dings
young writer the next week
i sailed for a cure
in south america
and began a long
wandering journey abroad
