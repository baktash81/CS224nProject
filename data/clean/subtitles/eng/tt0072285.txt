take it off the top
so there s lots of cream 
thanks 
the same  but with more cream 
thanks 
it s a shame  such a nice girl 
imagine not being able to talk 
completely mute 
no wonder  after what happened 
such a sweet  young girl 
it must be 15 years ago by now 
and the old man who raped her
got off scot free 
they said he was insane 
not responsible for his actions 
but it sure is strange
the girl can t talk 
the doctor said
it was because of the trauma 
some kind of mental block 
madeleine 
you better hurry if you want
to catch the 4 00 bus 
you haven t had any time off
for a month 
can you give me a single reason
not to come to town with me

157 horses

where the hell are you going 
there you are    my love 
now  here s the situation 
you have become hooked on heroin   
which isn t like
your ordinary amphetamines 
it s the toughest narcotic
in existence 
you re hooked both physically
and psychologically   
and you ll die in 48 hours
if you don t get a fix 
but we re not going to have
any trouble  are we 
do as i say and you ll get
your two shots a day 
 y i  i never want   
 y i to see you again 
 y i because you never understood 
 y i you never understood
 y i how much i hated that terrible farm 
 y i how your protective instincts
 y i suffocated me 
i have found a wonderful man
who has given my life meaning 
i m doing everything to forget
my horrible time with you 
i hope you ll forget
about me quickly 
you ll never see me again   
because i never want
to see you again 
signed  madeleine  
well  my little friend 
now life really begins 
you ll get two of these a day
if you do as i say 
your first visitor arrives at 1 00 
no mistakes  or you ll go without 
now  let s have a look at your room 
the accountant is arriving soon 
be nice to him 
hi  sweetheart 
take off your clothes 
tony  what the hell 
goddamn it 
what kind of bitches
do you have here 
how can i go home to my wife
with my face looking like this 
damn it 
i m gonna scar her for life 
i m doing great  how about you 
what  the pirate 
let me check  tuesday 
the pirate is available
between 2 00 and 4 00 
but the price has gone up 
yeah  she s more than sally 
is that okay  great 
my pleasure  thank you 
this is how it is from now on 
you re on your own 
every morning at 9 00 
you ll get a list from me
with names of customers
and times they ll arrive 
you ll get two packets
so you can make it through the day 
monday s your day off 
on sunday you ll get four packets
so you can make it through tuesday 
if you behave  you ll get
a percentage of the profits 
that s fair  isn t it 
here s today s list  in half an hour
you start with mr  andersson 
what 
that s right  i almost forgot 
get undressed 
my name s sally 
you poor thing 
the beginning s the worst 
you feel so sick you wanna die 
the only thing that keeps you going
is the dependency on dope 
if you go without for too long 
then you really start feeling things 
goddamn 
i tried to leave here once 
i ran back to my little town 
to mom 
but i fell apart 
i thought i d die 
tony sent two thugs to get me 
horrible bastards 
they ll do anything
for a couple of grand 
after those guys 
being back here seemed all right 
at the most you ll last 30 36 hours
without getting a new hit 
after that  it s over 
you get paranoid 
then you die 
unless you get another hit 
but i ve got a plan of my own
to fall back on 
i hit up all the johns
for additional loot 
for a bit of extra service 
in a year i ll have enough
to take off for switzerland 
there s a rehab clinic there
for drug addicts 
it takes four months
before you re cured 
but it takes dough 
around 60 000
for the entire treatment 
i should be able to leave
in about a year 
i get this way sometimes 
i can t help it 
hey  i saw tony
had a letter for you 
i took it when he wasn t looking 
 y i what a terrible letter
 y i we received today 
 y i how can our little madeleine   
 y i be so full of hate 
what did we do wrong 
what we did wrong
you could have set right 
now we have nothing to live for 
we are tormented by the fact
that our little madeleine   
is so full of hate 
after all these terrible
disappointments   
your father and i
only want to tell you   
not to worry 
you will never see us again 
madeleine   
you were our everything 
the sunshine of our lives 
good bye 
 y i the doctor said it was poison   
but i wonder where it came from 
it seems awfully strange
they were the only ones poisoned 
a lot of people bought milk that day 
well  i wonder 
you don t pour poison
in your milk by mistake 
i still wonder if it wasn t   
sure  after those terrible letters
the girl wrote her parents 
terrible letters 
i read the last one 
they took it really hard 
so  you want to learn how to drive
faster than the average guy 
half of this will do 
this is a model 96 rifle 
also called a mauser 
it was used in both world wars 
if you lie down   
a little further back  there 
hold it against your shoulder 
because it has a good kick 
hold it steady 
to load  lower the weapon 
pull the bolt up  then back 
and then insert the cartridge 
push down
and move the bolt forward 
then bring the gun up
against your shoulder 
make sure you keep it
steady against your shoulder 
place your finger on the trigger
and gently squeeze off a shot 
reload 
check your shoulder 
now aim and squeeze 
you ll have a visitor today
who s never been here before 
take good care of  
this is tony 
oh  hi there 
good  as usual 
sorry  what did you say 
the 2 4th  let s have a look 
she s just great  as usual 
step back 
you re striking too quickly 
sink down and strike hard 
that s better  step back 
now look 
if you re coming
into a curve like this   
and you start to skid   
you have to steer into the skid 
steer into it like this
until you come out of it here 
then you floor it 
wait here 
i have a present for you 
an extra hit 
by the way  sally s gone 
she won t be back 
got another job in beirut 
that s her business 
hope it works out well for her 
i can t teach you anymore
