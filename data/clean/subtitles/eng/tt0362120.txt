a terrible evil prepared
to unleash itself
upon an unsuspecting human race

sometimes i wake up in
the middle of the night
wondering where he is
and then i remember
i know you miss him too
but its really been hardest on me
im rattling on but if you
dont vent your emotions
they just well up inside of you
and burst out
the harder you try
the harder it all gets
till you just cant
shake it off anymore
oh
like youre carrying around
this enormous burden
sometimes your problems
get so big
and then what do you say to yourself
jesus
yes you can turn to religion
or family and friends

brenda look
hes a wonderful boy
ezekiel
ezekiel where are you
ezekiel
shall we have a foot race
no cheating
thats him
hes cute
friends friends do not fear the noise
of those of whom we do not speak
there is a gentle truce
between our village
and the creatures
beyond their borders
now who would like to say grace
ooh
ah ezekiel
peepee
peepee vagina
amen
father
holly
for what purpose
do you interrupt
the celebration
of the domestic partnership
of mordecai and hoss
the guards caught
two outsiders near the cabin
who are you
i must speak with you
i was sent by your son
dont be ridiculous
i have no son
thats not true
i know who you are
ive seen the pictures
i was young i needed the work
no
at mrs norriss house
i didnt know whose house it was
they drugged me
never mind that
youre outsiders
the council will decide your fates
the question of the outsiders
is now at hand
but first martha
have you some tidings
nathaniel winston
and alice smith
have informed me
of their intentions
he intends to have sex with her
as soon as possible
she intends to put up a mild fight
and then give in
amos something does trouble you
we now have a majority
of those who wish to say im
instead of i am
im for that
i am against it
silence
we have more important matters
to discuss
i fear that the presence
of the outsiders
will attract those of whom
we do not speak
if you talk about those
of whom we do not speak
have you not spoken of that
about which we do not talk
do not speak of that
of about which
we talk of not speaking
about
elder hale we should welcome
the outsiders among us
jeremiah ought not
your tongue be held
i am sorry elder hale
but sometimes my tongue wiggles
beyond my ability to control it
this is a problem with which
i have had much experience
maybe i could help him in a room
in which there are no others
or you can all watch
i dont give a shit
silence
after this how about you take
your thing of which we do not speak
and slide it up in my place
of which i like
silence
the elders will consult
ah much better
im not in my house am i
no
outsiders we have decided
to let you stay with us
so that youll be safe from
those from of whom we do not
or dont
speak
but now that you are
a part of our village
understand this
you may never leave
no no
how did your son die
the fate of the world is at stake
you know what to do
was it you did you kill him
this is some shit
up with which we will not put
im for that
i am against it
this village isnt
what it used to be
just hours after
the devastating alien attack
world leaders have gathered
at the united nations
in this mankinds darkest hour
the human race has turned as one
to the wisdom and leadership
of the president
of the united states
ladies and gentlemen
the president of the united states
go get em tiger
they mean you sir
oh yes of course
so an indian a frenchman
and the pope are all on a plane
the pilot says
hey are any of you not circumcised
so the pope lifts up
his robe and says
shut up stupid
you dont even speak english
the israeli asked the japanese guy
to open his eyes
but the japanese man says
im not squinting you crazy jew
youre the one who sold me
these cheap glasses
whats the difference between
a belgian and a lump of dog shit
the belgian drinks wine
but the dog shit smells good
but on a serious note
im here today at the uh
unbecause the earth
has been attacked
im happy to report that we may
have found a way to fight back
my military advisers
at the pentagram
have managed
to do the impossible
they have captured one
of the alien heat ray guns
as you know the heat ray destroys the body
leaving behind nothing but clothes
our engineers have managed to reverse
the polarity of the weapon
in the hopes that it can now
be turned against
the alien invaders
well where was i
ah yes we expect that the
alien shields will be vulnerable
to this reconfigured weapon
people please please
please people now i know that this
new technology may seem frightening
but i believe that deep down
inside this heat cannon
is our best chance
let me give you a demonstration
now lets see if this thing
is plugged in
uh its not a very pretty sight
everythings loose
and flapping around
look at this little pink thing
someone get some lubricant
and well slather it around in here
there
harper good god
these people are all naked
have you no shame
have you no decency
sir youre naked too
i am
i thought this was a wrinkly leather coat

and the invaders were destroyed
for this world our world
is the world of man
we have earned the right
to live here
and as long as we love
humanity will prevail
each of our enemies has failed
in their quest to defeat us
each has been undone
by their own nefarious plans
among all worlds
across all galaxies
we stand above we stand alone
none can threaten our existence
none can challenge our spirit
and why
of all the qualities
that make us unique
it is love that is
our greatest strength
