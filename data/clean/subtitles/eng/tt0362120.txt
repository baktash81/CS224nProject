in the early years
of the 21st century
that our world was being
watched   
the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinize the creatures
in a drop of water 
yet across the gulf of space
a terrible evil prepared
to unleash itself
upon an unsuspecting human race 
you re up early 
come back to bed 
come on 
please 
hello  hello 
tom  oh 
i know you missed me 
oh i missed you too  god you look great 
i wanted to come by to thank you
for setting up that job interview for me 
this isn t a good time 
i just need something to keep me busy
now that cody s out of the house 
he just turned 11 
i enrolled him in military
school last year 
it s supposed to be
a great program 
boy kids you know
they just grow up so fast 
so i heard
that you were dating again 
knowing you
i bet she s brainy 
 quixotic  
90 points 
oh you know your work with
the elderly really inspired me tom 
i mean they have
so much to teach us   
and we have so much
to teach them 
you know ultimately they   
really are just like us   
only    older 
anyway i m hoping that
a new career will help
keep my mind off of   
bad memories 
i m sure you have memories too 
he s the kind of person you never forget 
sometimes i wake up in
the middle of the night
wondering where he is
and then i remember 
i know you miss him too
but it s really been hardest on me 
i m rattling on but if you
don t vent your emotions   
they just well up inside of you
and burst out 
the harder you try
the harder it all gets   
till you just can t
shake it off anymore 
oh 
like you re carrying around
this enormous burden 
sometimes your problems
get so big 
  and then what do you say to yourself 
  jesus 
yes you can turn to religion
or family and friends   
but in the end
you re still in agony 
maybe that s why
i want to become a nurse 
i m just  i m so in tune
with everyone s emotions 
i guess i ve always had
a knack for being 
oh my

i always dreamt i would live
in a house like this with my husband   
but i guess that s all just in the   
past 
who wants to see upstairs 
it s a nice neighborhood
close to schools and shopping 
there are hardwood floors throughout 
passed almost every inspection 
big backyard goes back 100 feet 
and in here is the bathroom 
very big very   
nice 
it is nice 
it seems like
it d be a great place to work   
but i just can t shake
this feeling of    evil 
evil  that crazy talk 
do you know anything about
the people who used to live here 
people  no nothing about people 
i don t remember anything 
mr  koji did something strange
happen in this house

but i do know what it s like
to be in that much pain   
and the worst part is
you have to suffer through it 
  alone 
  it looks like we have a lot in 
common 
  we re already finishing each other s 
  dinner 
sentences 
well    maybe all we really need
is a friend 
i d like that 
well i better get back
to mrs  norris 
it s time to put her catheter in
and then after that   
i ve got to scrub
in between her fat folds   
and i ve got to lance her boils 
i ve got to open her up
and then 
   empty the colostomy bag and   
mop up the drool 
that s wonderful 
  i ll see you around

and i wonder if he s safe 
oh you d love him brenda 
what s his name 
i might ve already loved him 
tom ryan 
yeah did him 
big fat chinese guy 
no    no 
but he is the kind of guy that i d like
to share the rest of my life with 
cindy  look 
what is this place 
i don t know but the boy s father s
somewhere in there 
we ll have to sneak our way in 
but we re not gonna
blend in dressed like this 
  brenda look 
  he s a wonderful boy 
ezekiel 
ezekiel where are you 
ezekiel
shall we have a foot race 
no cheating 
that s him 
he s cute 
friends friends  do not fear the noise
of those of whom we do not speak 
there is a gentle truce
between our village
and the creatures
beyond their borders 
now who would like to say grace 
ooh 
ah ezekiel 
pee pee 
pee pee vagina 
amen 
father 
holly 
for what purpose
do you interrupt
the celebration
of the domestic partnership
of mordecai and hoss 
the guards caught
two outsiders near the cabin 
who are you 
i must speak with you 
i was sent by your son 
don t be ridiculous 
  i have no son 
  that s not true 
i know who you are 
i ve seen the pictures 
  i was young  i needed the work 
  no 
at mrs  norris s house 
i didn t know whose house it was 
they drugged me 
never mind that 
you re outsiders 
the council will decide your fates 
the question of the outsiders
is now at hand 
but first martha
have you some tidings 
nathaniel winston
and alice smith
have informed me
of their intentions 
he intends to have sex with her
as soon as possible 
she intends to put up a mild fight
and then give in 
amos something does trouble you 
we now have a majority
of those who wish to say  i m    
instead of  i am  
  i m for that 
  i am against it 
silence 
we have more important matters
to discuss 
i fear that the presence
of the outsiders
will attract those of whom
we do not speak 
if you talk about those
of whom we do not speak   
have you not spoken of that
about which we do not talk 
do not speak of that
of about which
we talk of not speaking   
about 
elder hale  we should welcome
the outsiders among us 
jeremiah ought not
your tongue be held 
i am sorry elder hale   
but sometimes my tongue wiggles
beyond my ability to control it 
this is a problem with which
i have had much experience 
maybe i could help him in a room
in which there are no others 
or you can all watch 
i don t give a shit 
silence 
after this how about you take
your thing of which we do not speak   
and slide it up in my place
of which i like 
silence 
the elders will consult 
ah  much better 
i m not in my house am i 
no 
outsiders we have decided
to let you stay with us   
so that you ll be safe from
those from of whom we do not 
or don t 
speak 
but now that you are
a part of our village   
understand this 
you may never leave 
no  no 
how did your son die 
  the fate of the world is at stake 
  you know what to do 
was it you  did you kill him 
this is some shit
up with which we will not put 
  i m for that 
  i am against it 
this village isn t
what it used to be 
just hours after
the devastating alien attack   
world leaders have gathered
at the united nations 
in this mankind s darkest hour   
the human race has turned as one   
to the wisdom and leadership
of the president
of the united states 
ladies and gentlemen
the president of the united states 
go get  em tiger 
they mean you sir 
oh yes of course 
so    an indian a frenchman
and the pope are all on a plane 
the pilot says
 hey are any of you not circumcised  
so the pope lifts up
his robe and says   
 shut up stupid 
you don t even speak english  
the israeli asked the japanese guy
to open his eyes   
but the japanese man says
 i m not squinting you crazy jew 
you re the one who sold me
these cheap glasses  
what s the difference between
a belgian and a lump of dog shit 
the belgian drinks wine
but the dog shit smells good 
but on a serious note
i m here today at the uh   
 un    because the earth
has been attacked 
i m happy to report that we may
have found a way to fight back 
my military advisers
at the pentagram
have managed
to do the impossible 
they have captured one
of the alien heat ray guns 
as you know the heat ray destroys the body
leaving behind nothing but clothes 
our engineers have managed to reverse
the polarity of the weapon
in the hopes that it can now
be turned against
the alien invaders 
well where was i 
ah yes  we expect that the
alien shields will be vulnerable
to this reconfigured weapon 
people please  please 
please people  now i know that this
new technology may seem frightening   
but i believe that deep down
inside this heat cannon
is our best chance 
let me give you a demonstration 
now let s see if this thing
is plugged in 
uh    it s not a very pretty sight 
everything s loose
and flapping around

we have earned the right
to live here   
and as long as we love

by their own nefarious plans 
among all worlds
across all galaxies   
we stand above we stand alone
