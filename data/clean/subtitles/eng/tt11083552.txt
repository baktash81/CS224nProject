he saved his partners life
what about
your firearms experience
your shooting was
unambiguously precise yet
your training scores

barely even passed
kill or be killed
exhales deeply

its the security footage
from the raid on
the fortico cash truck before
when the guards were killed
uh i cant watch this again
okey step outside
