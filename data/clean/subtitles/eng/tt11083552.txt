 whispers  could i get
another one  thank you 
 in normal tone 
we re not federal 
we re essentially middlemen 
hundreds of millions shifting
through here every week 
we got 12 trucks 
two or three guards in each 
a driver  a messenger 
and a guard 
each moving up to 15 mil
a day  and sometimes more 
which can attract
unwanted attention 
i won t lie 
it can be dangerous 
which is why
we train you properly
and pay the premium rates 
so we can all
sleep better at night 
thanks

last but not least  mr  hill 
okey  well  you re all

that s what happened 
what i don t understand
is how you managed
to take down six men
without even so much
as a scratch 
well  you gotta admit
it s impressive 
he saved his partner s life 
what about
your firearms experience 
your shooting was
unambiguously precise  yet
your training scores
were decidedly average 
barely even passed 
kill or be killed 
 exhales deeply 
seemed to focus the mind 
all right   clears throat 
well  there s something else 
we d like you
to take a look at this video 
it s the security footage
from the raid on
the fortico cash truck before 
when the guards were killed 
uh  i can t watch this again 
okey  step outside 
by all means 
we just want
you to let us know
if you think
there s any connection
between this robbery
and the men
you encountered before 
you  uh    you all right
to keep watching 
yeah  i m all right 
okey   muffled  mr  hill 
anything ringing a bell 
mr  hill 
could they be related
in any way 
   muffling stops 
  any connection  mr  hill

okey  you sure 
i m sure 
okey  all right  mr  hill 
we ll pick this up
another day 
are we done 
yeah  we ll be in touch 
visit the therapist  rest up 
thank you  mr  hill 
patrick  can i have a word 
we have a policy 
the shrinks advise
that employees be taken off
the front line for a month
following violent incidents 
and longer if lives were lost 
so  we re gonna
transfer you to desk duty 
in case of ptsd 
do i look disturbed 
no  no  you don t 
but then  these things
take time to manifest 
to percolate 
it s with your best interests
at heart 
you hired me to do a job 
did a job 
no  we hired you
to move money 
you hired me to protect money 
man  mr  hill 
hey  i m blake halls

what you did deserves credit 
you re a real hero

terry  we need that guy
in the field 
if we d had him last year 
we wouldn t be in this mess

catch this man for 25 years 
we re just gonna let him
sit on hundreds of millions 
money doesn t mean
