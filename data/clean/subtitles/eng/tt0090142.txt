a couple years back
a kid came to me the same way 
saying to me
the same thing you re saying 
he wanted to drop off the team 
his mother was a widow  all crippled up 
she was scrubbing floors 
she had a pin in her hip 
he wanted to drop basketball and get a job 
now these were poor people 
hungry people with real problems 
understand what i m saying 
what happened to the kid 
i don t know  he quit 
third stringer  i didn t need him 
  i m a first stringer

and killing chickens 
fearing full moons  dodging
silver bullets  well  no thank s

you know what 
you look great up there 
missed you at the hardware store 
  sorry  i was with stiles this afternoon 
  i know 
  you saw 
  yeah  i saw 
unless that was another werewolf
doing a handstand on stiles  wolfmobile 
look  dad 
i m trying to get a grip on this  i really am 
  is thorne still on your back 
  yeah  thorne   
   some neanderthal named mick
and the entire basketball team 
you ve dug your own hole
with those fellows  but   
   this thorne business is my fault 
what do you mean your fault 
it goes back a few years 
as you know  i loved your mother
since we were kids 
we were meant for each other 
but for some reason rusty
thorne set his cap for her too 
no matter what we tried 
he wouldn t go away 
  one night  things got physical and   
  and you turned into the werewolf 
out of anger  scott 
i turned into the werewolf out of anger 
  in front of his beady  little eyes 
  was he scared 
scared 
  he lost control of his bodily functions 
  i wish i could have seen that 
it wasn t a very nice thing to do 
but it worked 
after that he never
bothered your mother or me 
but to this day  i don t know
who was the most frightened that night 
old rusty thorne    or me 
you gotta get a hold of it  son 
  morning  daisy 
  morning 
  boof  what s up 
  nothing 
why does anything have to be up 
i thought i d walk to school with you 
  got any plans for the spring dance 
  hadn t given it much thought 
i m surprised they haven t decided
to call it  teen wolf ball  
  will you    go with me to the dance 
  i ll think about it 
  is that a yes 
  yes  on one condition 
  you take me to the dance 
  i thought we just established   
you  scott howard  not the wolf 
no  look  i ve got to be the wolf 
that s what everyone expects 
  is that what you want 
  everybody likes the wolf 
all right  almost everybody 
you said it yourself  if i go as
scott howard  i m gonna be average 
why do i have to be like everybody else 
that s not a problem for you anymore 
and i guess
i don t have a date for the dance 
look  boof  i m sorry  i can t 
hey  listen 
you ll still dance with me  won t you 
even if i m a werewolf 
yeah  i ll still dance with you 
  and feed me grapes
