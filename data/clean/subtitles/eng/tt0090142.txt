i was hoping i wouldnt have to
sometimes it skips a generation

and there was a full moon last night
i meant to talk to you about that last evening
but you were kind of upset
heres a nice hot cup of cocoa

yeah thorne
some neanderthal named mick
and the entire basketball team
youve dug your own hole
with those fellows but
this thorne business is my fault
what do you mean your fault
it goes back a few years
as you know i loved your mother
since we were kids
we were meant for each other
but for some reason rusty
thorne set his cap for her too
no matter what we tried
he wouldnt go away
one night things got physical and
and you turned into the werewolf
out of anger scott
i turned into the werewolf out of anger
in front of his beady little eyes
was he scared
scared
he lost control of his bodily functions
i wish i could have seen that
it wasnt a very nice thing to do
but it worked
after that he never
bothered your mother or me
but to this day i dont know
who was the most frightened that night
old rusty thorne or me
you gotta get a hold of it son
morning daisy
