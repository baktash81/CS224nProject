maybe you re a mammal 
where were you born  daddy 
i was born and brought up
on the banks of loch morar 
people whispered about a beastie
living in that very loch 
now  always there ve been tales
of sightings of such a creature   
   sometimes at sea 
but more often in a loch 
when i was a boy   
   how i longed to see that monster 
when i was a boy   
   terrible times they were 
boys and girls  wives and mothers
all over the world   
   left without the man of the house 
they all went off to war 
and many never came back 
we re a tiny village
in the wilds of scotland   
   but 20 men we lost 
but maybe i m boring you
with my story 
no  no  please  don t stop 
okay  if you insist 
angus was just like
every other wee boy 
he wanted his daddy home again 
but he also had another problem 
crusoe  you ate it all

the german advance 
if they invade 
they will come right through here 
this is the deepest loch in scotland 
perfect for their troopships 
but they will send submarines first
for reconnaissance 
won t the steel net stop them  sir 
the submarine net will be down   
   to permit passage
by routine marine traffic   
   and to let their subs in 
and then we will raise the net   
   and we will destroy them 
i wish i could swim like you

what s that noise 
i have a cough 
you got an animal in there 
look  you better let me in
or your mother will hear about this

he s very friendly 
mary and joseph 
 he almost died when he was born 
 almost took my hand off 
he thinks i m his father 
i wonder    
 it just can t be 
 can t be what 
well  it looks like a    
 like a bloody water horse 
 a what 
they re make believe 
a legend from the celtic past 
they re said to be
the rarest of all creatures 
there can be only one water horse
in the world at a time 
when the one grows old 
it lays a single egg  and then it dies 
 crusoe s a girl 
 no 
no  lad  he s girl and boy both 
the beast is both mum and dad
to the egg 
the old water horse dies
before the egg hatches   
   so the new water horse
is born an orphan 
oh  that s sad 
it s an amazing thing though  isn t it 
angus  kirstie 
don t tell her 
she d make us get rid of it 
angus 
will you help us  mr  lewis 
you re asking me
to deceive your mother 
angus  kirstie

 i was helping mr  lewis fix the pipes 
since when have pipes
been an interest of yours 
 wait  it s a bad time to interrupt him 
 what 
plumbing is tricky  it s like surgery 
one mistake could mean death 
mr  lewis found the problem 
i can explain  he  
always been handy
with the plumbing 
he s a genius 
and you helped  did you  angus 
yes  i  
 i handed the tools 
 and you  kirstie 
no  i came to get angus to show him
the civil assistance manual 
it s getting a bit cramped in here 
so off you go  did a grand job  angus 
bye 
it s the pipes 
it s the air locks bubbling through 
you see 
angus was a great help 
so you said 
oh  dear  excuse me  that s  
the doctor warned me
not to eat haggis for breakfast 
so it s something about the   
   texture of the innards mixed in
with the suet that i just can t

in a toilet bowl 
 but he can stay with me 
 whatever the devil he is   
   he s meant to swim and be free 
the loch is loaded
with salmon to eat   
   and there s plenty of water for him
to grow and move around in

no  no  i don t think so 
jings 
lewis  do you know anything more
about water horses 
i think it was   aye  it was my uncle
lachlan who first told me about them 
many years ago 
there was a lost traveler   
   and he s weeping bitter tears
because he cannot find his way home 
he d given up hope 
then suddenly  who should appear at
the bank of the loch to this traveler   
   but a sea spirit  a water horse 
the traveler  no fool is he  knows the
water horse is a creature of magic   
   one that could grow
10 feet tall overnight 
so the traveler  he feeds
the water horse  strokes it   
   flatters it with compliments 
and finally the traveler says 
 incidentally  water horse 
my dear friend   
   i m wondering  if you ve
no other pressing engagements   
   could i trouble you to carry me
across the loch on your back 
show me the way home  
well  what happens 
does the water horse help him 
i don t remember 
what  does the water horse
help him or doesn t he 
well  it was so long ago
that i heard it 
it either carries him across the loch   
   or it drags him down to the bottom
to his watery death 
i m not sure which 
here you go  your favorite snack

for you since we ve been here 
but i think you ll be impressed

to remain here on the perimeter 
and you might wanna cover your
ears  she packs a hell of a punch 
 come on  block your ears

for fame and jimmy s for fortune 
 to the left 
 jimmy mcgarry was a man   
   not to be lightly parted
from a pound or a penny 
 to the right 
 he had seen the monster   
   and he was determined
the rest of the world should see it too 
 get out of the picture

 we re going to be rich  rich 
you can come in now 
you daft buggers 
everyone had a tale to tell
about the monster 
everyone except poor angus 
he was sent to bed at 6
every night for a month 
even his goody two shoes sister   
   could not convince their mother
of the truth 
and no one
had laid sight of crusoe   
   since the bombardment   
   until that fateful night
