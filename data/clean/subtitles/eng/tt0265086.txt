the sergeant is a bit of an idealist
he believes in this mission down
to his bones dont you sergeant
look these people they have no jobs
no food no education no future
i just figure that i mean
we have two things that we can do

to make the right decisions
their lives depend on it
all right
rangers lead the way sir
all the way
good luck
a meeting of aidids senior cabinet
may take place today at 1500 hours
i say may because
we all know by now
with the intel we get on the street
nothing is certain
this is actual intel
confirmed by three sources
two tierone personalities
may be present
omar salad aidids top political advisor
and abdi hassan awale interior minister
these are the guys were after
today we go
same mission template as before
1545 assault force delta will
infiltrate the target building
and seize all suspects within
security force rangers 4 ranger chalks
under command of capt steele
will rope in at 1546
and hold a fourcorner perimeter
around the target building
no one gets in or out
extraction force
lt colonel mcknights humvee
column will drive in at 1547
on hawlwadig road and hold
just short of the olympic hotel
wait for the green light
now once delta gives the word
mcknights column will go to the target
and load the prisoners onto trucks
immediately after the
prisoners are loaded
the four ranger chalks will collapse
back to the target building
load up on humvees
and the entire ground force will
exfil the 3 miles back to base
mission time no longer than 30 minutes
now i had requested light armor
and ac130 spectre gunships
but washington in all its wisdom
decided against this
too highprofile
so black hawks and little birds
will provide the air cover
with miniguns and 275 rockets
colonel harrell
in the c2 bird colonel matthews
will coordinate the air mission
and i will coordinate ground forces
colonel matthews
mission launch code word is irene
questions
which building is it sir
were confirming that now
somewhere near the bakara market
i dont choose the time
or place of their meetings
i didnt say a word sir
make no mistake once youre
in the bakara market
youre in an entirely hostile district
dont underestimate their capabilities
well be in friendly neighborhoods
before we hit the market
so remember the rules of engagement
no one fires unless fired upon
now lets go get this thing done
good luck gentlemen
whats the matter danny
something you dont like
no spectre gunships
daylight instead of night
afternoon when theyre
all fucked up on khat
only part of the city aidid can mount
a counterattack on short notice
whats not to like
lifes imperfect
for you two circling above it at 500 feet
its imperfect
down in the street its unforgiving

itll take some time to mobilize
the 10th mountain and 100 vehicles
