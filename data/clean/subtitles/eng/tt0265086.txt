make him suddenly come to you 
make him more agreeable

i can mate you in three whatever you do 
i d keep my eye on that queen

our knight is slaying the dragon 
that s scary

sgt  eversmann 
you really like the skinnies 
it s not that i like them or i don t like them

see  what you guys fail to realize is
the sergeant is a bit of an idealist 
he believes in this mission down
to his bones  don t you  sergeant 
look  these people  they have no jobs   
no food  no education  no future 
i just figure that  i mean 
we have two things that we can do 
we can help   
or we can sit back and watch the
country destroy itself on cnn 
right 
i don t know about you guys 
but i was trained to fight 
are you trained to fight  sergeant 
well  i think i was trained
to make a difference  kurth

your men will look to you
to make the right decisions 
their lives depend on it 
all right 
rangers lead the way  sir 
all the way 
good luck 
a meeting of aidid s senior cabinet
may take place today at 1500 hours 
i say  may  because
we all know by now   
with the intel we get on the street 
nothing is certain 
this is actual intel
confirmed by three sources 
two tier one personalities
may be present 
omar salad  aidid s top political advisor   
and abdi hassan awale  interior minister 
these are the guys we re after 
today we go 
same mission template as before 
1545  assault force delta will
infiltrate the target building   
and seize all suspects within 
security force rangers  4 ranger chalks 
under command of capt  steele   
will rope in at 1546   
and hold a four corner perimeter
around the target building 
no one gets in or out 
extraction force 
lt  colonel mcknight s humvee
column will drive in at 1547   
on hawlwadig road and hold
just short of the olympic hotel 
wait for the green light 
now once delta gives the word   
mcknight s column will go to the target
and load the prisoners onto trucks 
immediately after the
prisoners are loaded   
the four ranger chalks will collapse
back to the target building   
load up on humvees   
and the entire ground force will
exfil the 3 miles back to base 
mission time  no longer than 30 minutes 
now  i had requested light armor
and ac 130 spectre gunships   
but washington  in all its wisdom 
decided against this 
too high profile 
so black hawks and little birds
will provide the air cover   
with miniguns and 2 75 rockets 
colonel harrell 
in the c 2 bird  colonel matthews
will coordinate the air mission   
and i will coordinate ground forces 
colonel matthews 
mission launch code word is irene 
questions 
which building is it  sir 
we re confirming that now 
somewhere near the bakara market 
i don t choose the time
or place of their meetings 
i didn t say a word  sir 
make no mistake  once you re
in the bakara market   
you re in an entirely hostile district 
don t underestimate their capabilities 
we ll be in friendly neighborhoods
before we hit the market   
so remember the rules of engagement 
no one fires unless fired upon 
now  let s go get this thing done 
good luck  gentlemen 
what s the matter  danny 
something you don t like 
no spectre gunships 
daylight instead of night   
afternoon when they re
all fucked up on khat   
only part of the city aidid can mount
a counter attack on short notice   
what s not to like 
life s imperfect 
for you two  circling above it at 500 feet 
it s imperfect 
down in the street  it s unforgiving 
what the fuck  smith

i m better on my own 
we started a whole new week 
it s monday 
i was talking to
blackburn the other day   
and he asked me   what changed 
why are we going home  
and i said   nothing  
but that s not true  you know 
i think everything s changed 
i know i ve changed 
a friend of mine asked
me before i got here   
it was when we were all shipping out 
he asked me 
 why are you going to
fight somebody else s war 
 what  do y all think you re heroes  
i didn t know what to say at the time   
but if he asked me again  i d say no 
i d say there s no way in hell 
nobody asks to be a hero 
it just sometimes turns out that way 
i ll talk to your ma and
pa when i get home  okay 
my love  you are strong and
you will do well in life 
i love you and my children deeply 
today and tomorrow 
let each day grow and grow 
keep smiling and never give up 
even when things get you down 
so  in closing  my love
