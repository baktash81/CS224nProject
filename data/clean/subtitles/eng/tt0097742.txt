talent that people here dont have
well that shouldnt be too difficult
senor bond you got big cojones
you come here to my place
without references carrying a piece
throwing around a lot of money

so nobody has to see you go out
senor sanchez i could be very useful
to a man in your position
and i understand you have a reputation
for rewarding loyalty very well
ill keep this for a few days
well talk again

sanchez so you pay
everyone and his brother

airline concession
why
simple its easier for the politicians
to take silver than lead
we have an invisible empire
from chile to alaska
what i want to do amigos
is to make you part of it
i want the pacific
to be our little puddle
what you have before you gentlemen
is a demographic report
breaking down each
of your territories
by age and socioeconomic group
now as you can clearly see
there is a huge potential demand
given the implementation
of aggressive marketing
as in the united states
senor sanchez is prepared to offer
each of you exclusive franchises
the price is 100
million per territory
i believe youll find that works out
to 20 million per metric ton mr tan
we guarantee quality
and price for five years
senor sanchez
since arriving weve eaten well
heard many good stories
but before i pay anything
i want to see some hardware
mr kwang
you dont pay for hardware
you pay for my personal
guarantee and protection

the matter with you
just a couple of things
kwang and his team
of british agents are dead
sanchez is alive
i saw you in hellers office

i want the truth
i am telling the truth
sanchez has arranged to buy four
stinger missiles from the contras
and hes threatened to
shoot down an american airliner
if the dea doesnt lay off
whats that got to
do with you and heller
felix gave me a letter at his wedding
from the attorney general
granting heller immunity
if he gets the stingers back
did he go for the deal
yes
and then you missed sanchez
and heller panicked and
he said the deal was off
and that i was dead
if he ever saw me again
theres more to this
than your personal vendetta
