right out of my pocket 
sanchez  so you pay 
everyone and his brother

what you have before you  gentlemen 
is a demographic report 
breaking down each

senor sanchez is prepared to offer
each of you exclusive franchises

million per territory 
i believe you ll find that works out
to  20 million per metric ton  mr  tan

senor sanchez 
since arriving  we ve eaten well 
heard many good stories 
but before i pay anything 
i want to see some hardware 
mr  kwang

main distribution center

kwang and his team
of british agents are dead 
sanchez is alive 
i saw you in heller s office

  i want the truth 
  i am telling the truth 
sanchez has arranged to buy four
stinger missiles from the contras 
and he s threatened to
shoot down an american airliner
if the dea doesn t lay off 
what s that got to
do with you and heller 
felix gave me a letter at his wedding
from the attorney general
granting heller immunity
if he gets the stingers back 
did he go for the deal 
yes 
and then you missed sanchez 
and heller panicked and
he said the deal was off 
and that i was dead
if he ever saw me again 
there s more to this
than your personal vendetta 
it s a mess 
sanchez has tripled his security 
you ll never get another shot at him

meet me at the harbor master s
office in two hours
