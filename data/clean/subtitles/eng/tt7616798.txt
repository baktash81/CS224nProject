my first home was full of cats 
and i m a dog 
cats had sharp claws
and made a funny tummy sound
when they were happy 
the kittens had a mother cat 
and i had a mother dog 
i couldn t imagine
that life could get any better 
as i grew  we made a home together 
we were happy
for a while 
look at all of  em

little by little 
mother cat became my mother

okay  we left work early
so we could be basically 
what  breaking and entering 
it s not breaking and entering  olivia

but they didn t get  em all 
and now  the builder says
he s gonna tear down the whole block 
cats or no cats 
men took my dog family

it s about your permit 
who on earth could that be 
i don t know  i ll get it 
excuse me 
there s been a complaint that you may be
harbouring a dangerous animal 
a complaint  from who 
as you may know  pit bulls are illegal
in the city of denver 
as long as it s on your property 
we can t touch it 
  i remember him 
  i am informing you
that if that dog
gets picked up on the street 
it will be impounded 
have a nice night 
okay  bella  this is very important 
we re gonna try this again 
okay  you ready

lucas 
it was so loud 
and all the dogs were so sad 
okay 
in you go 
i thought if i did good dog 
they d let me go back to lucas 
i did sit 
i did sit some more 
i did no barks 
i did lots of barks 
i really needed my lucas blanket 
i should have done go home 
come on 
hello 
hang on 
you don t seem like such
a dangerous animal to me  sweet girl 
come on  come on 
  hey 
  lucas 
  hi  hi 
  i m ready to do go home 
hey  see  i m here 
  i m here 
  well  there s question one 
she s obviously your dog 
good girl  i know  i know  good girl 
all right  there you go 
so  you ve paid the fine 
i just need to give you
the discharge information 
in denver  all that s required for a dog
to be classified as a pit bull
is for three animal control officers
to certify that it is 
and bella has been certified pit bull 
what does  certified pit  mean 
it means if they pick her up again 
she ll be euthanised 
  what 
  that s the law 
pit bull s a pretty loose description 
it s like saying  hound dog  
so  the city council essentially voted
that a dog can be banned from the city
because of how it looks 
that s basically racism for dogs 
i know  it s stupid 
i mean  bella is the most gentle dog
in the world 
you should see her at the hospital
with the veterans 
i mean  they love her 
what about if we move 
like  golden or somewhere
out of the city limits 
that works 
meanwhile  do you have someone
who can look after her 
my aunt and uncle 
they live in farmington 
  maybe they could help us 
  new mexico 
it s like 400 miles 
i m really ready to do go home now 
all right  here we go 
got your dinosaur 
what else do we have 
it s so good of you to do this 
we re just happy to help 
olivia s such a sweetheart 
well  this is it 
i ll be in the car 
why is everyone so sad 
we re all home  now 
bella  i m so sorry 
see you soon 
okay  i ll sneak out the back window 
at least there s no screen on that one 
hey 
here  i got ya  i got ya 
hello 
stop 
backup can t possibly get here
fast enough to help you 
we understand the little game
that you re playing here 
it s gunter  isn t it 
you work for him 
maybe you re just buddies 
now  you re gonna let my son
walk to that car
to say goodbye to his dog
without any interference from you 
copy 
copy 
go on  bella  that s it 
hey 
you re such a good girl  bella 
i know you won t understand 
but i m not abandoning you 
i just have to send you somewhere safe 
where are we going 
why can t i ride in the front with you 
here 
you gotta have your blanket 
why did he bring my lucas blanket 
it should be on the bed 
i promise  very soon 
you ll get to go home 
lucas said   go home  
but then he shut the door 
i need lucas 
please  no 
his scent was fading 
i was getting farther and farther away 
i smelled my lucas blanket
to feel better 
but it wasn t lucas 
sit 
bella  come here 
yes 
you re so pretty  yes  you are 
these people were nice 
they took care of me 
but they weren t my family 
this wasn t home 
hello 
hey  how is everything 
she s fine  yeah  really 
okay  all right  see you tomorrow  then 
guess what 
they found a nice place in golden 
and they re coming to get you tomorrow 
i bet you re ready to go home 
you re a good dog  bella 
josé said   go home  
  you re a good dog 
  but how 
good night 
that feeling came again 
i was supposed to be with lucas 
i had to find a way to get to him 
i didn t know what that loud thing was 
but josé sure liked to take it
for walks around the yard 
but i do remember that
from snow do your business 
wait 
yes 
i m doing it 
i m doing go home 
i could tell that go home
was very far away 
but i knew that i was going
in the right direction 
the feeling now was a pull 
like i was on a leash
and being told how to do go home 
and if i kept going 
i knew i would see lucas again 
by that first night  i was so tired 
and there were so many strange smells 
what s that 
it looks like a cat 
but it smells like a dog 
i hope it doesn t come back 
it was breakfast time 
but i couldn t find
a bowl of food anywhere 
it s not in a bowl 
but i ll take it 
this breakfast is really fast 
i need breakfast 
this breakfast was harder to hunt
than that squirrel 
i was hungrier than i d ever been 
people 
there are people down there 
a pack 
maybe i shouldn t bother them 
but i m so hungry 
one tooth is big 
to be polite  i ll carefully sniff
where the other dogs have marked 
what 
crazy hair is in charge 
thanks 
this was a great pack 
they knewjust where to go
to get the best chicken 
hey  there you are 
yeah  today s special  chicken 
you like that  you like   
i love this chicken guy 
okay  very good  that s it  that s it 
you can go now  okay  go 
coming 
one tooth was a brave hunter 
who wasn t afraid of anything 
it was exciting
to learn to hunt from him 
  this pack was so much fun 
  hello 
hi  sweethearts 
and who are you  are you new 
there you go  sweethearts  yeah 
please go home  now 
go on home  now  go on home 
how did she know i was doing go home 
go home 
  it was a wonderful day 
  good boy  sarge 
but where s one tooth going 
all right  in you go  come on 
and shaggy butt  too 
guess that just leaves
you and me  crazy hair 
wait 
everyone in this pack
has their own people 
crazy hair wanted me to go with him 
to be part of his family 
it seemed nice in there 
with lots of good smells 
i could be happy here 
but they didn t need me 
mom needed me 
lucas needed me 
and i needed them 
lucy  there you are 
so  i had to keep doing go home 
now  i knew that to hunt 
i needed to go where there were people
and do what one tooth taught me 
i smelled blood 
it was the largest animal
i had ever seen 
and something very bad
had happened to her 
come on  through here 
i see it  go 
thing s gotta be worth a thousand bucks 
at least  beautiful 
  what do you figure  about 125 pounds 
  yeah 
  hey  let s get a selfie 
  yeah  you bet 
okay  ready 
  yeah 
  here 
she s beautiful 
  yeah  that one s going up on the wall 
  yeah 
what is that 
it kind of looks like a cat 
i hoped the cat would leave with me
and not get caught by those bad men 
that cat didn t smell
like any cat i ever knew 
was it following me 
yep  it was following me 
and suddenly  i realised
it wasn t a full grown cat 
it was still just a kitten 
a really big kitten 
come on  big kitten  this way 
that big animal
must have been this kitten s mother 
big kitten made me think of mother dog
and how sad i was
when she was taken away 
she needed someone to take care of her 
big kitten s mother
couldn t feed her any more 
so  i did 
i was big kitten s mother cat now 
big kitten needed to eat  and so did i 
so  i did what any mother would do 
i went hunting 
sorry  baby 
hey  hey  drop it 
many nights  big kitten would
wander off on her own 
i would sleep and dream of home 
you ready for your tiny piece of cheese 
here you go  good girl 
you re such a good dog  bella 
as time passed
and big kitten got bigger 
she still didn t seem to understand
how to do go home 
so  when she tried
to take me away from it 
i would always have to bring her back 
whenever big kitten went out at night 
someone gave her food 
cats love fish 
but i wish
someone would give her chicken 
we kept each other warm 
we were family now 
i had been smelling something
all morning 
something like dog 
first  i heard them 
then i saw them 
their eyes were cold 
they were hunting us 
and i had to protect big kitten 
hey  get out  get out of here

  is that a bobcat 
  no  no  it s a cougar

his name was axel 
and he always had me on a leash 
  hi  sweet girl 
  hi 
you are so sweet 
  here you go 
  bye 
thank you 
good for business  bella 
something about him was familiar 
axel was sad the way mack was sad 
the way mom was sad 
i wanted to go have fun
like i did with the pack 
but axel didn t understand
that dogs need to play 
easy  girl 
we kept each other warm 
good dog 
he made sure i was never hungry 
good dog  bella 
slowly  the air got warmer 
but axel got sadder and sadder 
i didn t think axel would ever
take me off the leash 
i didn t like being chained 
it didn t feel right 
i didn t know how to help axel
and still take care of myself 
i needed to do go home 
i love you 
it s just me and you 
you re the only friend i ve got 
i love you  bella 
i love you 
it s you and me  bella 
you and me 
bella  i love you 
i love you  bella 
i love you 
i laid with axel while the heat
slowly drained away from him 
until there was no more axel
and he was no longer sad 
i sat  being a good dog 
thinking someone would come for me 
nobody came 
being a good dog didn t work 
it was as if the whole world
had forgotten me 
but i couldn t give up 
i was so thirsty 
i needed water 
okay  bella  this is very important 
you ready  all right 
go home 
that s it 
go home  bella

i think so 
what are you gonna do 
good dog 
water never tasted so good 
i knew now that my journey
was much longer than i d ever imagined 
two winters 
how many more winters would there be 
and how many more could i take 
their smell was everywhere 
they were hunting me again 
i knew they would come 
but i wasn t gonna let them think
i was afraid 
is that   
it is big kitten 
and she s a big  big kitten now 
it felt so good to be together again 
and i could tell
big kitten felt the same 
i knew lucas would be excited
to meet big kitten 
and we would all
sleep together in the bed 
lucas was definitely
gonna need a bigger bed 
now  that s a new smell 
i don t know what those are 
and i don t want to know 
big kitten 
there it is 
go home and lucas 
big kitten wanted me to follow her 
and i wanted her to follow me 
i knew then that big kitten
would not be coming home with me
to sleep on the bed 
i will always be your mother cat 
i loved big kitten 
but i knew i would never see her again 
a dog

there s a stray dog
that just pushed its way into my house 
i could smell they had been gone
for a long  long time 
i tried so hard  and i d come so far 
i just couldn t take another step 
mother cat 
how did you get so small 
  call about a stray dog 
  i did 
  you 
  you 
mother cat watched me leave 
just like big kitten did 
i guess that s how cats say goodbye 
there was just one more place
to look for lucas 
  that s good 
  later 
  see you 
  bye 
  dogs 
  yeah  that s a good boy 
i used to be the only one 
  olivia 
  what 
i think a stray dog just came through 
the alarm goes off  i get up 
i got somewhere to go 
i like the job 
no way 
can t be 
bella 
it is her  come here  come here  girl 
what happened to you  girl 
what  what is it 
  no 
  lucas 
it can t be 
bella 
lucas  lucas  lucas 
bella  bella  you re alive 
i can t believe it 
bella  where have you been
all this time 
  is that bella 
  yeah  it is  it really is 
bella 
oh  my god  it s been
like two and a half years 
  hi 
  lucas  olivia  mom 
i did go home 
  she came home 
  i know  i know 
can you call the vet 
tell him we re on the way 
  yeah  yeah 
  i ll get the car 
lucas  lucas  there s an officer outside
who says you have to bring that dog out 
i m so sorry 
come on 
you kidding 
all right  everybody 
no big deal  nothing to worry about 
i m just here for that pit bull 
and if any of you interfere 
these officers  they will arrest you 
we don t want any trouble 
but we have to take that animal 
i thought i d see why
half the department
is out here on
a routine animal control call 
anybody want to fill me in 
captain  i m here for a confiscation 
and some of these people 
they re trying to turn it
into some kind of a situation 
it s obstruction 
harbouring a dangerous animal 
and disobeying a lawful order 
well  which one of you
is responsible for this crime spree 
i thought it might be
something like that 
that a pit bull 
doesn t look like a pit bull to me 
she s my dog  sir  and she s hurt 
i m taking her to the vet 
well  i m sorry to tell you
that chuck s right 
we have to take your dog
in to the shelter 
all right 
but to do so  you ve got to go through
the 1st battalion  3rd marine division 
united states marine corps 
1st infantry  army 
82nd airborne division  u s  army 
6th fleet  united states navy 
101st airborne  screaming eagles 
4th infantry division 
united states army 
you really want this thing to escalate 
do you 
ma am  myjob is to enforce the law 
and the law says
i ve got to impound this dog 
now  if that means tasers
and pepper spray 
then that s what it means 
under denver city ordinance 8    
wait 
he said  denver  
that s right 
but this isn t denver 
  this is federal property 
  it s what 
the va hospital is federal property 
it isn t technically a part
of the city of denver 
so  that s it  captain 
there doesn t have to be a fight 
 cause you don t have jurisdiction 
so  where did you two serve 
  basra 
  kabul 
huế  tet offensive 
all right  show s over 
let s pack it up 
yeah 
if i see this dog leave the premises 
i will pull your car over 
no  you won t 
chuck  i get more complaints about you
than all the other acos combined 
turn that vehicle in 
i m pulling you out of the field 
and nobody is pulling
anyone over for a dog 
got it 
good 
oh  my gosh  bella 
we missed you so much 
i don t understand what just happened 
but i m pretty sure it was good 
look what i found in the chest 
i totally forgot 
  come here 
  remember this  bella 
my lucas blanket 
  i wanted to try something 
  yeah 
this was her favourite thing
when she was little 
but after all she s been through 
i don t know if she ll remember 
bella  do you want   
  a tiny piece of cheese 
     a tiny piece of cheese 
she does remember 
she s an amazing dog 
she really is 
i was really home
with lucas  and olivia  too 
i was where i needed to be 
and big kitten was where
she needed to be 
i finally understood
