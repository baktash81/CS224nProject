come on
hello
hang on
you dont seem like such
a dangerous animal to me sweet girl
come on come on
hey
lucas
hi hi
im ready to do go home
hey see im here
im here
well theres question one
shes obviously your dog
good girl i know i know good girl
all right there you go
so youve paid the fine
i just need to give you
the discharge information
in denver all thats required for a dog
to be classified as a pit bull
is for three animal control officers
to certify that it is
and bella has been certified pit bull
what does certified pit mean
it means if they pick her up again
shell be euthanised
what
thats the law
pit bulls a pretty loose description
its like saying hound dog
so the city council essentially voted
that a dog can be banned from the city
because of how it looks
thats basically racism for dogs
i know its stupid
i mean bella is the most gentle dog
in the world
you should see her at the hospital
with the veterans
i mean they love her
what about if we move
like golden or somewhere
out of the city limits
that works
meanwhile do you have someone
who can look after her
my aunt and uncle
they live in farmington
maybe they could help us
new mexico
its like 400 miles
im really ready to do go home now
all right here we go
got your dinosaur
what else do we have
its so good of you to do this
were just happy to help
olivias such a sweetheart
well this is it
ill be in the car
why is everyone so sad
were all home now
bella im so sorry
see you soon
okay ill sneak out the back window
at least theres no screen on that one
hey
here i got ya i got ya
hello
stop
backup cant possibly get here
fast enough to help you
we understand the little game
that youre playing here
its gunter isnt it
you work for him
maybe youre just buddies
now youre gonna let my son
walk to that car
to say goodbye to his dog
without any interference from you
copy
copy
go on bella thats it
hey
youre such a good girl bella
i know you wont understand
but im not abandoning you
i just have to send you somewhere safe
where are we going
why cant i ride in the front with you
here
you gotta have your blanket
why did he bring my lucas blanket
it should be on the bed
i promise very soon
youll get to go home
lucas said go home
but then he shut the door
i need lucas

his scent was fading
i was getting farther and farther away
i smelled my lucas blanket
to feel better
but it wasnt lucas

josé said go home
youre a good dog
but how
good night
that feeling came again
i was supposed to be with lucas
i had to find a way to get to him
i didnt know what that loud thing was
but josé sure liked to take it
for walks around the yard
but i do remember that
from snow do your business
wait
yes
im doing it
im doing go home
i could tell that go home
was very far away
but i knew that i was going
in the right direction
the feeling now was a pull
like i was on a leash
and being told how to do go home
and if i kept going
i knew i would see lucas again
by that first night i was so tired
and there were so many strange smells
whats that
it looks like a cat
but it smells like a dog
i hope it doesnt come back
it was breakfast time
but i couldnt find
a bowl of food anywhere
its not in a bowl
but ill take it
this breakfast is really fast
i need breakfast
this breakfast was harder to hunt
than that squirrel
i was hungrier than id ever been
people
there are people down there
a pack
maybe i shouldnt bother them
but im so hungry
one tooth is big
to be polite ill carefully sniff
where the other dogs have marked
what
crazy hair is in charge
thanks
this was a great pack
they knewjust where to go
to get the best chicken
hey there you are
yeah todays special chicken
you like that you like
i love this chicken guy
okay very good thats it thats it
you can go now okay go

one tooth was a brave hunter
who wasnt afraid of anything
it was exciting
to learn to hunt from him
this pack was so much fun

please go home now
go on home now go on home
how did she know i was doing go home

crazy hair wanted me to go with him
to be part of his family
it seemed nice in there
with lots of good smells
i could be happy here
but they didnt need me
mom needed me
lucas needed me
and i needed them
lucy there you are
so i had to keep doing go home
now i knew that to hunt
i needed to go where there were people
and do what one tooth taught me
i smelled blood
it was the largest animal
i had ever seen
and something very bad
had happened to her
come on through here
i see it go
things gotta be worth a thousand bucks
at least beautiful
what do you figure about 125 pounds
yeah
hey lets get a selfie
yeah you bet
okay ready
yeah
here
shes beautiful
yeah that ones going up on the wall
yeah
what is that
it kind of looks like a cat
i hoped the cat would leave with me
and not get caught by those bad men
that cat didnt smell
like any cat i ever knew
was it following me
yep it was following me
and suddenly i realised
it wasnt a fullgrown cat
it was still just a kitten
a really big kitten
come on big kitten this way
that big animal
must have been this kittens mother
big kitten made me think of mother dog
and how sad i was
when she was taken away
she needed someone to take care of her
big kittens mother
couldnt feed her any more
so i did
i was big kittens mother cat now
big kitten needed to eat and so did i
so i did what any mother would do
i went hunting
sorry baby
hey hey drop it
many nights big kitten would
wander off on her own
i would sleep and dream of home
you ready for your tiny piece of cheese
here you go good girl
youre such a good dog bella
as time passed
and big kitten got bigger
she still didnt seem to understand
how to do go home
so when she tried
to take me away from it
i would always have to bring her back
whenever big kitten went out at night
someone gave her food
cats love fish
but i wish
someone would give her chicken
we kept each other warm
we were family now
i had been smelling something
all morning
something like dog
first i heard them
then i saw them
their eyes were cold
they were hunting us
and i had to protect big kitten
hey get out get out of here

that dogs need to play
easy girl
we kept each other warm
good dog

slowly the air got warmer
but axel got sadder and sadder
i didnt think axel would ever
take me off the leash

i needed to do go home

youre the only friend ive got
i love you bella

its you and me bella
you and me
bella i love you

i laid with axel while the heat
slowly drained away from him
until there was no more axel
and he was no longer sad
i sat being a good dog
thinking someone would come for me
nobody came
being a good dog didnt work
it was as if the whole world
had forgotten me
but i couldnt give up
i was so thirsty
i needed water

it felt so good to be together again
and i could tell
big kitten felt the same
i knew lucas would be excited
to meet big kitten

i dont know what those are
and i dont want to know
big kitten
there it is

big kitten wanted me to follow her

who says you have to bring that dog out
im so sorry

you kidding
all right everybody
no big deal nothing to worry about
im just here for that pit bull
and if any of you interfere
these officers they will arrest you
we dont want any trouble
but we have to take that animal
i thought id see why
half the department
is out here on
a routine animal control call
anybody want to fill me in
captain im here for a confiscation
and some of these people
theyre trying to turn it
into some kind of a situation
its obstruction
harbouring a dangerous animal
and disobeying a lawful order
well which one of you
is responsible for this crime spree
i thought it might be
something like that
that a pit bull
doesnt look like a pit bull to me
shes my dog sir and shes hurt
im taking her to the vet
well im sorry to tell you
that chucks right
we have to take your dog
in to the shelter
all right
but to do so youve got to go through
the 1st battalion 3rd marine division
united states marine corps
1st infantry army
82nd airborne division us army
6th fleet united states navy
101st airborne screaming eagles
4th infantry division
united states army
you really want this thing to escalate
do you
maam myjob is to enforce the law
and the law says
ive got to impound this dog
now if that means tasers
and pepper spray
then thats what it means
under denver city ordinance 8
wait
he said denver
thats right
but this isnt denver
this is federal property
its what
the va hospital is federal property
it isnt technically a part
of the city of denver
so thats it captain
there doesnt have to be a fight
cause you dont have jurisdiction
so where did you two serve
basra
kabul
huế tet offensive
all right shows over
lets pack it up
yeah
if i see this dog leave the premises
i will pull your car over
no you wont
chuck i get more complaints about you
than all the other acos combined
turn that vehicle in
im pulling you out of the field
and nobody is pulling
anyone over for a dog
