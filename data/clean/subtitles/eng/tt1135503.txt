i cannot computercoach you every day
while im with my girlfriends

its about our generation turning 30
people turning 30  oh my life i am so busy
i dont know when i can fit you in
may i remind you i dont want to
see you you want to see me
yeah would a breakfast work
l believed her what kind of idiot am l
she said
its about our generation turning 30
whatd you expect
annabelle was always a liar
julie powell once the editor of
the amherst literary magazine
the one we all knew would be the one
temped for eight years before giving up
on her novel
and now works in a cubicle
as a midlevel bureaucrat
attempting to deal with
the aftereffects of 911
oh god you memorized it how pathetic
she left so much out
anyway the picture was good
i looked fat
just your face
i forgot to tell you
do you know what annabelles doing now
sarah told me a blog
of what
what do you mean of what
a blog of annabelle
of every thought
that passes through her brain
her stupid vapid insipid
i could write a blog
i have thoughts
and youre a writer
which is more than i can say for annabelle
if only that were true
you wrote a novel
haif a novel
and no one wanted to publish it
youre not a writer unless someone
publishes you
see thats whats so great about blogs
you dont have to be published
you can just go online
press enter and there it is out there
what would i write a blog about
youre an editor tell me
why dont you write about
how much you love queens
a short blog
you could write about your job
if i wrote a blog about my job
and anyone at work ever read it
i mean hello
this is good
this is really good
on top of which the whole idea of writing
a blog is to get away from what i do all day
the way that cooking is a way
that i get away from what i do all day
so write a blog about cooking
im not a real cook
like julia child or mario batali
julia child wasnt always julia child
if i really wanted to learn to cook
i could just cook my way through
julia childs cookbook
i could blog about that
i have a copy i stole it from my mother
last time i was in texas
when i was eight my fathers boss came
to dinner and it was a really big deal
and my mother made boeuf bourguignon
but it wasnt just boeuf bourguignon
it was julias boeuf bourguignon
and it was like she was there
like julia was there in the room
on our side like some great big good fairy
and everything was going to be all right
im gonna try to fiip this thing over now
which is a rather daring thing to do
she changed everything
before her it was frozen food
and can openers and marshmallows
dont knock marshmallows
when you fiip anything
youve just got to have the courage
of your convictions
especially if its a loose sort of mass like
that didnt go very well
but you see when i fiipped it
i didnt have the courage i needed
shes so adorable
the way i shouidve
but you can aiways put it together
and youre aione in the kitchen
whos to see
pearls the woman is wearing pearls
in the kitchen
youve just got to practice like the piano
im julia child
bon appétit
bon appétit
bon appétit
bon appétit
julia child is coauthor of the book

okay heres a problem
ive never eaten an egg
and i have a hyperacidic stomach

the julia child cookbook
and write a blog about it

i cooked artichokes with hollandaise sauce
which is meited butter thats been whipped
into a frenzy with egg yoiks
untii its died and gone to heaven
and let me say this
is there anything better than butter
think it over
every time you taste something
thats deiicious beyond imagining
and you say what is in this
the answer is aiways going to be butter
its incredible
its been whisked into submission
thats why
the day theres a meteorite heading toward
the earth and we have 30 days to iive
i am going to spend it eating butter
heres my finai word on the subject
you can never have too much butter
august 24th day 1 1
is this what you mean when you say dont
crowd the mushrooms is this a crowd
353 days to go a horribie day at work
an oid grandma who iooked as if
she wouidnt harm a fiy
called me a penciipushing capitaiist dupe
but then i came home and cooked chicken
with cream mushrooms and port
and it was totai biiss
heres the big news
i had been cooking mushrooms
the wrong way my entire iife
dont crowd the mushrooms
otherwise they wont brown
are you iistening whoever you are
youre gonna love that one
day 22
this ones really good with fig jam
i got carried away in dean  deluca iast
night and spent haif my takehome pay
and the first thing i reaiized
when i got to the subway
with my groceries a bag of cat iitter
a bottie of oiive oii i absoiuteiy couid not
iive without and a huge bunch of branches
was that the branches were
probabiy not a good idea
sorry
they were siapping foiks in the face
right and ieff and i was sweating like a pig
not surprising since ive been way too busy
cooking fattening food to bother exercising
and then i came home and got
a big vote of confidence from my mother
remind me again why youre doing this
blog
whatever its called
its a regimen mom like doing situps
well its just adding pressure
what pressure
you have a fulltime job
you have a husband
and now youre gonna get sick
from biogging
its sort of like being in aa
what are you saying
lt gives you something you have to do
every day one day at a time
how do you know this iingo
honey are you an aicohoiic
im saying its good for me to have
shortterm goals
well that is silly that is just piain silly
whos reading this biog
people people are reading it im sure
well its something you decided to do
and you can decide not to
and not one singie persons gonna mind
no dont you get it i just started
i cant stop i have to finish its all ive got
hello hello
stupid dead phone
hey its not all you got
i know i know i didnt mean that
yesterday i poached an egg
it seemed like the perfect thing to do
on perhaps the second worst workday
in recorded history
explain to me how youve never eaten
an egg in your whole life
ive had eggs in like cakes
never had an egg egg
l was a very willful child
its simmering
i had this notion god knows why
that poaching eggs wouid be simpie
but i was deepiy wrong
lmmediately and gently push the white over
the yolk with a wooden spoon
for two to three seconds lmmediately
disgusting
oh maybe the eggs arent fresh
julia says the eggs have to be fresh
they are fresh
okay you dont have to bite my head off
im just quoting julia
it took three of us crammed into the
kitchen over a pot of simmering water
but eventually we naiied it
hello
welcome
how cute is that
and i ate my very first egg
of my whoie iife ever ever ever
l thought eggs were going to be greasy
and slimy but it tastes like
cheese sauce yum
julia child you are so good
cheers
cheers
and may i say excellent wine
do you think julia knows about you
i wish
i have this fantasy that she comes for dinner
and i show her my new lemon zester
we become very close
the truth is no one knows about me
l feel like im just sending things
into this giant void
which reminds me annabelles blog
have you read it lately
yes
its sort of funny
is it
shes dating this rich guy who owns a plane
his names lester
and they do it in the air
people love it its a huge hit
what do you think it means
if you dont like your friends
its completely normal
men like their friends
were not talking about men
whos talking about men
so its five weeks down 47 to go
and i feei fantastic
sometimes i cant heip but wonder
is there anyone out there reading me
but im sure you are
arent you somebody
anybody
ernestine i have a comment
my mother doesnt count
today we will begin by learning to boil eggs
first you must make sure
that the egg is fresh
l was so hoping that
well for something a little more advanced
madame brassart
but you are not an advanced cook
but i do know how to boil an egg
do you know how to bone a duck
no but thats exactly the sort of thing
that im very interested
in learning how to do
there is one other class
but you will not like it
its for professionnei
which you will never be im sure
all men all gls
and very expensive
i cannot imagine
that you would ever want to pay the tuition
how much
so the onion is ready but
you must hold the knife
first of all like this
wrist easy leave the thumb here
the hand and the knife are one
and the hand the other hand
you must protect it
here you must cut only the onion yes
not me
yes
and then you put your thumb here
and the other fingers here
jule
youre being a little overcompetitive
dont you think
well you shouldve seen the way
those men looked at me
as if i were some frivolous housewife
just looking for a way to kill time
well
where are you going
not here
you hungry
no
good
tada
weli done madame child
dear avis
im in my third week at le cordon bieu
and im in utter biiss
every morning the aiarm goes off at 630
and i ieap out of bed
im up
by 730 im in ciass in my apron
peeiing potatoes
then we cook stock and we bone fish
we dress pigeons
we make pastry with so much butter
it aimost stops your heart just to iook at it
my teacher moves so quickiy
im sometimes iost
but im way ahead of the others in the ciass
all of them men
and all of them very unfriendiy
untii they discovered i was feariess
something i reaiized
about the same time they did
morning ciass ends at 1 230
then i go home and make iunch for paui
then paui takes a nap
and iater in the affernoon he goes back
to the embassy and i go back to schooi
you must have a mortar and pestle
incidentally my father is horrified
im going to cooking schooi
offered to give me extra money
to hire a cook
go on fun  joy this is what matters
im probabiy the oniy american i know
in paris
who thinks shopping for food
is as much fun as buying a dress
course youd think so too
if you iived in a country
where absoiuteiy nothing comes in my size
by the way did you know
that if you dont dry meat
it wont brown properiy
irma rombauer doesnt say a word about it
in the joy of cooking
avis i am in heaven here
ive been iooking for a career all my iife
happy valentines day
and ive found it
we met in ceylon when we were in the oss
but he never noticed me at first
well thats not true i noticed you
l noticed your legs straightaway
oh you were such a roué
all the women were mad for him
can you blame them
anyway we were sent off to china
absolutely delicious if i do say so myself
julia
when you finish your term
youll be teaching at cordon bleu
no i dont think so
the woman who runs it absolutely hates me
come on
oh no one could possibly hate you
thats true but she does
were you spies
no yes no
oh so cagey right
you were in the office of strategic services
and you were not spies
l was only a file clerk
but paul paul designed all of the secret
war rooms for general mountbatten
well just maps and exhibits and things
lt wasnt
he did
he singlehandedly won the war for us
well i had to someone did
i mean it was dragging on wasnt it
anyway so there we were in china
just friends having dinner
and it turned out to be julia
lt turned out to be julia all along
julia you are the butter to my bread
and the breath to my life
l love you darling girl
happy valentines day
dear chariie
julia in front of her stove
has the same fascination for me
as watching a kettie drummer
at the symphony
the oven door opens and shuts so fast
you hardiy notice the deff thrust of a spoon
as she dips into a casseroie
and up to her mouth for a taste check
like a perfectiytimed doubie beat
on the drums
then with her bare fingers
she snatches a set of cannelloni
out of the pot of boiiing water
and she cries
these damn things
are as hot as a stiff cock
she said what
i know
julia child said hot as a
i know im shocked
its from a letter that paul child
wrote to his twin brother charlie in 1 949
when julia was just starting classes
at le cordon bleu
so julia and paul beaucoup beaucoup
i know just goes to show you
what
you can never tell about
a persons sex life by looking at them
they were so in love

l used to be thin and now im getting fat
fat
on top of which
i have to bone a whole duck
when
at some point
can you even conceive of boning a duck
no i cant
of course you cant
im sure you all remember
because it was oniy a few days ago
that i had a meitdown over my aspic
and vowed to transform myseif
into a better human being
and then i was trussing
the poulet rôti à la normande
which is roast chicken stuffed with
chicken iivers and cream cheese
and it fell on the fioor and the stuffing
fell out into a big gooey mess
so iong story short another meitdown
this is crazy
worse than the iast
i cant even truss
and i cried like a small
emotionally disturbed child
im a mess
l got it i got it

converting these recipes
from the metric system

dear dorothy
your sister juiia is now a cooking teacher
we have three students who pay 2 a ciass
bareiy enough to cover the cost of the food
but who cares
simca louisette and i
are les trois gourmandes
aithough sometimes we are oniy
les deux gourmandes
because louisette
turns out to have headaches
and doctors appointments
she scheduies during ciass
i have a little headache
youll meet them both
when you come here next month
uniess of course
louisette is having a stomachache
perfection
and even if it isnt never apologize
no excuses no explanations
louisette abandoned us
another stomachache
and the day before that
she left class before we even finished
making the chocolate bavarian cream
i cant believe thats the only time
her dentist could see her
keep an eye out
we dont want to miss dorothy
its impossible to miss your sister
i dont see her

all i think about all day is food
and then i dream about it all night
lt is true shes obsessed
if i didnt sit in the kitchen id never see her
last week i dreamed that
l made cassoulet for dad
and he hated it of course
he doesnt understand any of this
l almost feel sorry for him
he wanted so much
for us to stay in pasadena
marry republicans and breed like rabbits
why didnt we
too tall
lets face it its true
from the beginning
you just dont fit in literally
so then you dont
i know its true
do not bait father about politics

i cant make any promises
he loves senator mccarthy
oh i know
pasadena
pasadena
jinx
dort do you have   you have the brie

you ever had in your life

the answers yes
l got the chef at chez la mère michel
to give me the recipe for beurre blanc
beurre bianc whats beurre bianc
butter in a white wine vinegar reduction
i love butter
you whisk them together
and the acid in the vinegar
works on the milk solids in the butter
so that the butter instead of melting
becomes this
creamy light frothy
with kind of a fantastic subtle kind of
tangy
lt has a tanginess
tanginess
yes
well thats
thats who i married
anyway
you serve it on fish and its splendid
im going to make it for you
thatll be divine
yeah
and dort were going to throw you a party
really
very exciting
by the way theres a man
that i want to introduce you to

hes
tall hes very tall
pardon

extremely tall
im extremely tall

julia there you are
john
there you are
now where is this sister of yours
shes right over there hi john
hi paul
there
so weve told her a lot about you
well i dont want to
interrupt her conversation
with lvan cousins they just met
i cant imagine dorothy running off
with lvan cousins
dearly beloved
john this is lovely
ive never been to a wedding like this before
here julia
what a beautiful wedding
thanks pops
l am not enthusiastic about this marriage
well you werent very enthusiastic
about ours either
true
how are things at the embassy paul
fine thank you phila thank you
well not fine really because
theyve cut our library allowance by 90
lt seems that senator mccarthy
has very long arms
senator mccarthy is a man
who knows his mind
l admire a man who knows his mind
well we know lots of people in washington
who have lost their jobs
after years in government service
for no reason whatsoever
and paul had to make a list of
every single book in the embassy library
surely youre not suggesting that
the french government is any better
and
shall we dance
come on dance with me
excuse us
you said you didnt want to talk about it
then you went and talked about it
i know i never learn
wheres my big sprig
up here whipping away
and for dinner mayonnaise
thats good
that is good isnt it
very from your sister
im going to send this recipe to avis
im very excited about it
i think its a breakthrough
well it tastes like it
dorothy is pregnant
paul
lsnt that wonderful
yes
okay
im so happy
i know
i know
if you warm the bowl slightly
before you beat in the egg yolk
it changes everything
foolproof mayonnaise absolutely foolproof
l typed it up
you disagree
about the mayonnaise not at all
im sure youre exactly right
scientific workability thats my motto
julia
we have a little problem
our editor
for our cookbook
thinks our book is not in english
but your book is in english
they are giving it a rejection
but they suggest that
if we are continuing with it
we should get a collaborator
who could take what we have
and make it work for american cooks
would you do it julia
would i do it
yes
we are now going to piay a round of
guess whos coming to dinner
this wednesday i am going to be
piaying host to a distinguished guest
ciue number one
the degree of separation
between julia child and me
is about to shrink
by a factor of about a thousand
a thousand
in answer to your questions no it is not
amanda hesser ofthe new york times
or nigella lawson or ina garten
but heres ciue number two
i will be making boeuf bourguignon
which was the first dish
our distinguished guest cooked
upon reading mastering the art
of french cooking for the first time
boeuf bourguignon
julia childs boeuf bourguignon
well since no one guessed my mystery
guest im going to have to tell you all
its judith jones
the editor whos responsibie
for getting juiias cookbook pubiished
way back when
the woman who recognized history
in an onionskin manuscript
shes oider and probabiy not used to
eating at 1 000 at night
which is why im being diiigent about this
and making the stew the night before
and as i cook it
i aimost feei as if julia and i
are communicating over space and time
on a deep spirituai mysticai ievei
aithough mostiy im just taiking to myseif
how long does it take to cook
two and a haif hours
weicome
im julia child
and today were going to make
a holiday foast or les fètes dholiday
and were going to start with haifboned
chicken or poularde demidésossée
now first remove the iiver and fry it up
with some onions for a iittie snack
or perhaps a deiicious iiverwurst
which you can spread on a cracker
a ritz cracker a saitine
saltine
or if you have a pet a cat or a dog
they love iiver
save the iiver
save the liver
save the liver
now you piace the chicken on its stomach
and cut aiong the backbone
to the popes nose like so
crack
now ive done it
ive cut the dickens out of my finger
well im giad in a way this happened
you know accidents do occur
from time to time in the kitchen
weve never really discussed what to do
first you must stop the bieeding
the best way is with direct pressure
on the apron like so
you want to raise your hand over your head
i recommend naturai coaguiants
such as chicken iiver
another reason not to throw away the iiver
oh god its throbbing
a tourniquet thats it
why are you all spinning
well i think im going to go to sieep now
bon appétit
no no no
well its just a big dry collection
of recipes
it doesnt work at all
im just gonna have to throw
most of it out and start all over again
this has got to be a cookbook
that makes french cooking accessible
to americans who do not have cooks
who are servantless
is that a word
servantless
i think it is a word
julia
what if we had to leave paris
why would we have to leave paris
because my assignment was for four years
so then we still have time
eight months
and this cookbook is not something
you can finish in eight months
no but two years seems possible
julia
what if they transfer me someplace else
would they do that
yes
they dont really care about me
paul of course they do
they dont really
well if we cant stay in paris
then ill just mail the pages
to louisette and simca
and they can mail them back to me
thats why they invented the mail system
and carbon paper and onionskin copies
or i can just jump on the train to paris
whenever the three of us
absolutely have to work together you know
or the two of us actually because as
we know louisette does next to nothing
but we would still be somewhere in europe
dont you think
its very hard to say
given the current political climate
senator mccarthy
does not like people like us
us why what have we done
we havent done anything
thats not the point
the point is we were in china
and thats practically sufficient
well meanwhile were still here
yes we are youre right
yes
heres to the book
french cooking for all
or french home cooking
do you like that which one do you like
i like them both
dear avis enciosed is part of our cookbook
from the chapter on sauces
naturally it must not be shown to anyone
uniess you are sure they are not
never have been
and wont have anything to do
with the pubiishing business
there are peopie
who wouid love nothing more
than to steai this hollandaise recipe
were late do you suppose shell be there
louisette of course shell be there
its at her house
l was making a little joke
whats this about anyway
louisette wouldnt tell me
she said it was a surprise
maybe shes dropping out of the project
that would be heavenly
julia
well it would
my friends this is lrma rombauer
mrs joy
the first edition of the joy of cooking
took me a year to write
only a year lncluding testing the recipes
well i didnt really test all the recipes
there were so many of them
and then i found a publisher
a small printer in st louis
how much money did he pay you
l paid him 3000
a small fortune
but i had a little life insurance money
because my husband
no
he killed himself
yes
and i thought well what else am l
gonna do with the insurance money
and then the book began to sell
and bobbsmerrill picked it up
so now i had a real publisher
and they gave you some money
absolutely not
they swindled me they stole my copyright
and now theres a new edition
and guess what
what
the index is a complete calamity
if youre looking for city chicken
youre not gonna find it under c
really
its under drumsticks mock
no
all she wanted to talk about
was how her publisher had cheated her
out of thousands of dollars in royalties
lt just made me realize this
not going to be simple
this getting published business
this is from avis for you
oh my well
what does she say now
avis loves my sauce chapter
thats wonderful darling
oh no
she showed it to someone
which i specifically asked her not to do
she showed it to an editor
at houghton mifflin in boston
and the boston editor showed it
to the head of publishing and
paul  paul
yes what what what what what
they want to
they want to publish our book
thats great news
and they want to give us an advance
how much
no
and when the book is finished 500 more
im so proud of you
the editor loves the book
she just loves it
so with the smell of burned stew
still in the air
l woke up dying of stomach cramps
l called in sick
and went back to bed for several hours
put it in put it in the blog in case
someone in your office reads it
and went back to bed for several hours
by noon i was somehow abie to
straighten myseif up to a standing position
what are you making
bought the ingredients for
boeuf bourguignon all over again
boeuf bourguignon
dragged myseif home
and made another boeuf bourguignon
and for dessert a raspberry bavarian cream
by the end of the day i feit fine
i was cooking dinner for a iegend
even though id never really heard of her
untii a few months ago
maybe shell offer you a book contract
what if she does
i mean what would that mean
that would mean i might be a writer
how much money
do people make for books
like an advance i have no idea
1 00 000
dont even say it
hello
hi
i know i know i know
lt is here too cats and dogs
i know
well thanks
bye
so not coming
that was the guy
from the christian science monitor
its raining
and we live in long lsland city
and shes like older
its mortitying
but on the bright side more stew for us
just for once could you not
look on the bright side
yeah well its not the end of the world
l thought i really did think i just did
l thought book contract
me judith jones happily ever after
and then wed have a little money
and we wouldnt live over a pizzeria
for the rest of our lives
how am i gonna explain this
my readers are gonna be really upset
they were so into it
your readers are gonna be really upset
i never shouldve told everyone
theyll live
somehow
your readers will live
is it bland
not anymore
thank you for telling me that
you almost let me feed judith jones
bland boeuf bourguignon
this is a nightmare
l told everyone she was coming
they will survive
and when this years over
and i cannot wait until it is
your readers will somehow
get on with their lives
and i wont is that what youre saying
i dont know i have no idea
i mean whats gonna happen when
youre no longer the center of the universe
thats just great
l am finally totally engaged in something
okay maybe im being a little narcissistic
a little on a scale of 1 0
okay a 9 3 but what do you think a blog is
its me me me day after day
l thought itd be fun how stupid is that
lt just turns out to be a lot of
what you call meltdowns
but they dont feel like meltdowns
they feel like im living with
a totally selfabsorbed person
who writes this stuff
for a bunch of complete strangers
and its supposed to be a big adventure
but its not
its our life its our marriage
and here in this room it doesnt
feel like an adventure it feels like shit
lt was your idea
i know im so sorry
what the hell was i thinking
and ill tell you something else
l am not a saint
yes you are
no im not
yes you are
no im not
and it makes me feel like an asshole
every time you say it
and do not write about this in your blog
about what
about this fight
im outta here
you all right julia
yes fine
im perfectly fine
dear avis we finished packing today
and tomorrow we ieave beloved paris
for marseilles
paui has been appointed cuiturai affairs
commissioner for the south of france
im having a hard time pretending to be
anything but devastated
im going to go buy some bread
the advantage of marseilles is that
it wont have the distractions of paris
so well be abie to finish the book
aithough not on deadiine
at ieast were still in france
dear avis i dont know
what weve done to deserve it
but here we are in germany
actually in a suburb of bonn
called piittersdorf on the rhine
which sounds much more picturesque
than it is
by the way there is no chance
well meet our new deadiine
well be at ieast two more years
meanwhiie paui has been
called to washington
we have no idea why
well theyre going to promote you finally
they have to
well i dont know why they have to call me
back to washington to tell me that
they could just send a telex
ltd be a lot cheaper
well theyre going to reassign you then
theyll ask you whether
you prefer paris or paris
its a possibility
its not likely but it is a possibility
and if they are moving us back to paris
i can look for an apartment
when im there next week
good idea yes
l promise ill call you the minute they tell me
were being transferred back to paris
all right
all right
i know darling i know
i think it could happen
lt could happen i know
stay right there thats perfect
say cheese ducky
move your hand
good great
put your legs together darling
its very simple
were just going to tell her she should have
a smaller share of the royalties
because it is clear she cant put in the 40
hours a week you and i are spending on it
sixty is more like it eighty
exactly
you and i are vaches enragees
thats exactly what we are mad cows
but i cant bring myself
to say this to louisette
youre going to have to do it
i wili do it we must be coldblooded
l shall love her much more
when this is settled
lt isnt that youre not helping
to some extent
but i am helping
lt was my idea to add peas
to the coq au vin recipe
we know and that was a wonderful idea
but the book has become a magnum opus
but we are a team
we are les trois gourmandes one for all
yes its absolutely true louisette
yes its true
and you have been very valuable
to the project
thank you
but
l am getting a divorce
what
jeanluc is leaving me
im so sorry louisette
just forget that i even mentioned it
but it isnt fair for louisette to get
the same amount of money that we do
simca this is not the time to discuss this
shes getting a divorce
but she doesnt do the work
you dont do the work
so your share should be 1 0
ten percent
youre not doing the work
twentyfive
fifteen
twenty
eighteen and not a penny more
and where it says our names
l think it should say
by julia child and simone beck
with louisette bertholle
with
and in smaller type
no no no no simca
our names exactly the   exactly
and alphabetical alphabetical
but it was not even her idea
to put the peas in the coq au vin
no
but it bothers me
for me
dear avis weve been through
our own version of kafka
paui went off to washington
and in my innocence
i thought it must be because
the united states government
had finally reaiized how vaiuabie he was
far from it he was being investigated
he spent three days being grilled
in a windowiess room
with a foothigh stack of papers
ominousiy sitting on the tabie
they asked him about our friends
our books
our china years our patriotism
they even asked him
if he was a homosexuai
are you a homosexual mr child
no
l am not a homosexual
this is not a joke
im well aware of that
he came home exonerated
but thoroughiy bruised
julia it was a nightmare
what am i going to do
l feel like my entire life has been a waste
paul
i have one more posting
then ill retire and then what
well figure it out
l just dont know what it was all for
you know
you at least have the book
well its your book too
lt is
without you it wouldnt be a book
not that simca and ill ever be done with it
someday youll be done with it
im beginning to wonder
so to wrap things up
at 622 iast night
guess who wasnt coming to dinner
thats right
it began pouring down rain
and judith jones canceied
i was utteriy crushed
and then on top of everything
i had a horribie fight with my husband
and he ieff me
the boeuf bourguignon was delloicus
not that i ate it
as for the raspberry bavarian cream
i am taking it to the office
morning
julie could you come in here
l didnt tell him i swear
julie
feeling better
much
so you burned the stew
but thats not why i didnt come to work
l didnt come to work because i had
stomach flu
listen its a free country
but this little thing of yours on the lnternet
i do not want to show up in it okay
and if you dont feel like coming in to work
let me know
somebody wili want this job
were trying to do something here
im sorry
anyone else would fire you
a republican would fire you
im not a schmuck
im in shock i cant believe it
youre like the ones if you and eric
cant make it work who can
all sorts of people can
just not me because i am a bitch
l am sarah im a bitch
i know i know you are
by the way garth and i broke up
oh god i didnt even ask
l am a oneway street just like eric says
its okay i wasnt in love with him
do you really think im a bitch
well yeah
i know
but who isnt
julia
ive been thinking about me and juiia
she was a secretary
for a government agency and i am too
a really nice guy married her
a really nice guy married me
both of us were iost
and both of us were saved
by food in some way or other
so major overiaps
but lets face it i am not julia child
julia child never iost her temper
just because something boiied over
or collapsed in the oven
or just piain fell through
and she was never horribie to her husband
im sure
and she never behaved like
who has time to be married
which is how i behave sometimes
im sorry to say
i wish i were more like her
she deserved her husband and i dont
thats the truth
well anyway thats the truth for now
yogurt for dinner
hi youve reached eric powell at
archaeology magazine leave a message
i hated sieeping without you iast night
where are you
l miss you
hello

well get back to it
its gonna be good for you to finish
something for once in your iife
julia didnt give up

well im just saying dont
hey

well if shes not here we can take a taxi
they probably have taxis in boston
shell be here wearing a plaid jacket
thats how im to recognize her
what do you mean recognize her
has she changed
well
look for the middleaged woman
in a plaid jacket
so
you and avis have never met
were just pen pals
you dont know each other
well we do we write
but how did you start writing one another
thats a long story
avis husband bernard de voto now dead
was a wonderful wonderful writer
he wrote an article in harpers magazine
all about stainless steel knives
and how he absolutely detested them
yes
and so i wrote him a fan letter
because he was 1 00 right
and avis wrote me back
and so i wrote her back
and she wrote me back
well its been eight years i think
avis
julia
my darling friend
look at you
brilliant friend bless you
this is a very impressive undertaking
mrs child and mrs beck
well thank you very very much
and your editor loves it
i do i think its brilliant
theres really nothing else like it
on the market
the problem is not just the length
its 700 pages
yes we know lt is long
yes we know its long
you have 700 pages
of just sauce and poultry recipes
we were thinking that you could publish it
in a series of volumes
volume one sauces
volume two
poultry
yes
volume three fish
meat vegetables and desserts
thats one two three   thats six volumes
eggs
eggs
eggs seven seven volumes
but we dont want to publish
an encyclopedia
l thought this was intended for housewives
yes housewives want something quick
with a mix
like this
but if i may speak for everyone
if you were willing to revise it
im sure we would all be interested
simca i am so sorry
you just picked the wrong collaborator
yes i should have worked with this woman
baked alaska in a flower pot
well just take the book away from
houghton mifflin and find another publisher
we have just begun to fight
julia your book is a masterpiece
what is marshmallow fluff
and keep the advance by the way
keep the entire 250
dont give them back a penny of it
why did we ever decide to do this anyway
what were we thinking
who can remember
i can
we wanted to write a french cookbook
for american women who do not have cooks
so then thats what weli do
well just do it all over again
and thats that ltll be easy
it will the dessert section is done
thanks to simca it is brilliant
thank you
i just havent typed it up yet
but that will give me something to do
in oslo
eric come see
the worlds most beautiful chicken
naughty

l just want to savor this moment
the moment when anything is possible
the moment that you can just imagine
theyre going to love everything you did
and its going to sell a million copies
and change the world
yes but i think
it calls for a great bottle of wine
dont you think
yes

she is the person i write for every day
although i dont think she ever reads it
i dont know
im dying to meet her
i would like to be a bridesmaid
in her wedding in 1 946

how much more serious could a person be

he didnt know if shed read it
but she definitely had an opinion about it
do you think its because i use
the f word every so often

there is nothing wrong with her nothing
ive spent a year with her shes perfect

im never gonna meet her
but you already know her
thank you
youre welcome anytime
she saved me
you saved yourself
i was drowning
and she pulled me out of the ocean
dont get carried away
julia child began iearning to cook
because she loved her husband
and she loved food
and she didnt know
what eise to do with herseif
and in the process she found joy
i didnt understand this for a iong time
but i do now
julia taught me that
but heres what julia really taught me
so here we are
one day to go and one recipe
you may think that boning a duck
is an impossibie feat
and the whoie procedure
nothing is impossible
can take as iong as 45 minutes
the first time because of fear
dont be afraid
no fear julia no fear
take your knife confront the duck
confronting the duck youre my duck
you make a deep siit
down the back of the bird
all the way from the neck down to the taii
to expose the backbone
and with a small sharp knife
its edge aiways cutting against the bone
i did it look at that julia
it looks just like yours
down one side of the bird
pulling the fiesh
thread the boned duck on a board
face skin side down
patting it into piace roll out the dough
two hours and remove it from the oven
and let it cooi for severai hours
lt looks exactly the way
its supposed to look
