call julie about interview 
find out about dry cleaning 
find out before dinner on thursday 
saturday party 
no 
i cannot computer coach you every day
while i m with my girlfriends 
what is it about  the article 
it s about our generation turning 30 
people turning 30   oh  my life  i am so busy 
i don t know when i can fit you in 
may i remind you  i don t want to
see you  you want to see me 
yeah  would a breakfast work 
l believed her  what kind of idiot am l 
she said 
 it s about our generation turning 30  
what d you expect 
annabelle was always a liar 
 julie powell  once the editor of
the amherst literary magazine 
 the one we all knew would be  the one  
 temped for eight years before giving up
on her novel 
 and now works in a cubicle
as a mid level bureaucrat 
 attempting to deal with
the aftereffects of 9 11   
oh  god  you memorized it  how pathetic 
she left so much out 
anyway  the picture was good 
 i looked fat 
 just your face 
i forgot to tell you 
do you know what annabelle s doing now 
 sarah told me  a blog 
 of what 
what do you mean  of what  
a blog of annabelle 
of every thought
that passes through her brain 
her stupid  vapid  insipid     
i could write a blog 
i have thoughts 
and you re a writer 
which is more than i can say for annabelle 
 if only that were true 
 you wrote a novel 
haif a novel 
and no one wanted to publish it 
you re not a writer unless someone
publishes you 
see  that s what s so great about blogs 
you don t have to be published 
you can just go online 
press enter and there it is  out there 
what would i write a blog about 
you re an editor  tell me 
why don t you write about
how much you love queens 
a short blog 
you could write about your job 
if i wrote a blog about my job
and anyone at work ever read it     
 i mean  hello 
 this is good 
this is really good 
on top of which  the whole idea of writing
a blog is to get away from what i do all day 
the way that cooking is a way
that i get away from what i do all day 
so write a blog about cooking 
i m not a real cook 
like julia child or mario batali 
julia child wasn t always julia child 
if i really wanted to learn to cook 
i could just cook my way through
julia child s cookbook 
i could blog about that 
i have a copy  i stole it from my mother
last time i was in texas 
when i was eight  my father s boss came
to dinner and it was a really big deal 
and my mother made boeuf bourguignon 
but it wasn t just boeuf bourguignon 
it was julia s boeuf bourguignon 
and it was like she was there 
like julia was there in the room 
on our side like some great big good fairy 
and everything was going to be all right 
i m gonna try to fiip this thing over now 
which is a rather daring thing to do 
she changed everything 
before her  it was frozen food
and can openers and marshmallows 
don t knock marshmallows 
when you fiip anything 
you ve just got to have the courage
of your convictions 
especially if it s a loose sort of mass like   
that didn t go very well 
but  you see  when i fiipped it 
 i didn t have the courage i needed   
 she s so adorable 
   the way i shouid ve 
but you can aiways put it together 
and you re aione in the kitchen 
who s to see 
pearls  the woman is wearing pearls
in the kitchen 
   you ve just got to practice  like the piano 
i m julia child

yesterday was tuesday  august 1 3th  2002 
day one  364 days to go 
i cooked artichokes with hollandaise sauce
which is meited butter that s been whipped
into a frenzy with egg yoiks
untii it s died and gone to heaven 
and let me say this 
is there anything better than butter 
think it over 
every time you taste something
that s deiicious beyond imagining 
and you say   what is in this  
the answer is aiways going to be  butter  
it s incredible 
it s been whisked into submission 
that s why 
the day there s a meteorite heading toward
the earth and we have 30 days to iive 
i am going to spend it eating butter 
here s my finai word on the subject 
you can never have too much butter 
august 24th  day 1 1  
is this what you mean when you say   don t
crowd the mushrooms   is this a crowd 
353 days to go  a horribie day at work 
an oid grandma who iooked as if
she wouidn t harm a fiy
called me a pencii pushing capitaiist dupe 
but then i came home and cooked chicken
with cream  mushrooms and port 
and it was totai biiss 
here s the big news 
i had been cooking mushrooms
the wrong way my entire iife 
don t crowd the mushrooms 
otherwise they won t brown 
are you iistening  whoever you are 
you re gonna love that one 
day 22 
this one s really good with fig jam 
i got carried away in dean   deluca iast
night and spent haif my take home pay 
and the first thing i reaiized
when i got to the subway
with my groceries  a bag of cat iitter 
a bottie of oiive oii i absoiuteiy couid not
iive without  and a huge bunch of branches
was that the branches were
probabiy not a good idea 
sorry 
they were siapping foiks in the face
right and ieff and i was sweating like a pig 
not surprising  since i ve been way too busy
cooking fattening food to bother exercising 
and then i came home and got
a big vote of confidence from my mother 
remind me again why you re doing this   
 blog 
 whatever it s called 
it s a regimen  mom  like doing sit ups 
 well  it s just adding pressure 
 what pressure 
you have a full time job 
you have a husband 
and now you re gonna get sick
from biogging 
 it s sort of like being in aa 
 what are you saying 
lt gives you something you have to do
every day  one day at a time 
how do you know this iingo 
honey  are you an aicohoiic 
i m saying it s good for me to have
short term goals 
well  that is silly  that is just piain silly 
who s reading this biog 
people  people are reading it  i m sure 
well  it s something you decided to do 
and you can decide not to 
and not one singie person s gonna mind 
no  don t you get it  i just started 
i can t stop  i have to finish  it s all i ve got 
hello  hello 
stupid dead phone 
hey  it s not all you got 
i know  i know  i didn t mean that 
yesterday  i poached an egg 
it seemed like the perfect thing to do
on perhaps the second worst workday
in recorded history 
explain to me how you ve never eaten
an egg in your whole life 
i ve had eggs in  like  cakes 
never had an  egg  egg 
l was a very willful child 
it s simmering 
i had this notion  god knows why 
that poaching eggs wouid be simpie 
but i was deepiy wrong 
 lmmediately and gently push the white over
the yolk with a wooden spoon
 for two to three seconds   lmmediately 
disgusting 
oh  maybe the eggs aren t fresh 
julia says the eggs have to be fresh 
they are fresh 
okay  you don t have to bite my head off 
i m just quoting julia 
it took three of us  crammed into the
kitchen over a pot of simmering water 
but  eventually  we naiied it 
 hello 
 welcome 
how cute is that 
and i ate my very first egg
of my whoie iife  ever  ever  ever 
l thought eggs were going to be greasy
and slimy  but it tastes like
cheese sauce  yum 
julia child  you are so good 
 cheers 
 cheers 
and  may i say  excellent wine 
 do you think julia knows about you 
 i wish 
i have this fantasy that she comes for dinner
and i show her my new lemon zester 
we become very close 
the truth is  no one knows about me 
l feel like i m just sending things
into this giant void 
which reminds me  annabelle s blog 
have you read it lately 
yes 
 it s sort of funny 
 is it 
she s dating this rich guy who owns a plane 
his name s lester 
and they do it in the air 
people love it  it s a huge hit 
what do you think it means
if you don t like your friends 
 it s completely normal 
 men like their friends 
we re not talking about men 
who s talking about men 
so it s five weeks down  47 to go 
and i feei fantastic 
sometimes  i can t heip but wonder 
is there anyone out there reading me 
but i m sure you are 
aren t you  somebody 
anybody 
ernestine  i have a comment 
my mother  doesn t count 
today we will begin by learning to boil eggs 
first  you must make sure
that the egg is fresh 
l was so hoping that     
well  for something a little more advanced 
madame brassart 
but you are not an advanced cook 
but i do know how to boil an egg 
do you know how to bone a duck 
no  but that s exactly the sort of thing
that i m very interested
in learning how to do 
there is one other class 
but you will not like it 
it s for professionnei 
which you will never be  i m sure 
all men  all gls 
and very expensive 
i cannot imagine
that you would ever want to pay the tuition 
how much 
so the onion is ready  but     
you must hold the knife 
first of all  like this 
wrist  easy  leave the thumb here 
the hand and the knife are one 
and the hand  the other hand 
you must protect it 
here  you must cut only the onion  yes 
 not me 
 yes 
and then  you put your thumb here
and the other fingers here 
jule 
you re being a little over competitive 
don t you think 
well  you should ve seen the way
those men looked at me 
as if i were some frivolous housewife 
just looking for a way to kill time 
well     
 where are you going 
 not here 
 you hungry 
 no 
good 
ta da 
weli done  madame child 
dear avis 
i m in my third week at le cordon bieu 
and i m in utter biiss 
every morning the aiarm goes off at 6 30 
and i ieap out of bed 
i m up 
by 7 30 i m in ciass  in my apron 
peeiing potatoes 
then we cook stock and we bone fish 
we dress pigeons 
we make pastry with so much butter 
it aimost stops your heart just to iook at it 
my teacher moves so quickiy
i m sometimes iost 
but i m way ahead of the others in the ciass 
all of them men 
and all of them very unfriendiy 
untii they discovered i was feariess 
something i reaiized
about the same time they did 
morning ciass ends at 1 2 30 
then i go home and make iunch for paui 
then paui takes a nap 
and iater in the affernoon  he goes back
to the embassy and i go back to schooi 
you must have a mortar and pestle 
incidentally  my father is horrified
i m going to cooking schooi 
offered to give me extra money
to hire a cook 
go on  fun   joy  this is what matters 
i m probabiy the oniy american i know
in paris
who thinks shopping for food
is as much fun as buying a dress 
course  you d think so too 
if you iived in a country
where absoiuteiy nothing comes in my size 
by the way  did you know
that if you don t dry meat 
it won t brown properiy 
irma rombauer doesn t say a word about it
in the joy of cooking 
avis  i am in heaven here 
i ve been iooking for a career all my iife   
 happy valentine s day 
    and i ve found it 
we met in ceylon when we were in the oss 
but he never noticed me at first 
well  that s not true  i noticed you 
l noticed your legs straightaway 
oh  you were such a roué 
 all the women were mad for him 
 can you blame them 
anyway  we were sent off to china 
absolutely delicious  if i do say so myself 
julia 
when you finish your term 
you ll be teaching at cordon bleu 
no  i don t think so 
the woman who runs it absolutely hates me 
come on 
oh  no one could possibly hate you 
that s true  but she does 
were you spies 
no  yes  no 
oh  so cagey  right 
you were in the office of strategic services
and you were not spies 
l was only a file clerk 
but paul  paul designed all of the secret
war rooms for general mountbatten 
well  just maps and exhibits and things 
lt wasn t     
he did  
he single handedly won the war for us 
well  i had to  someone did 
i mean  it was dragging on  wasn t it 
anyway  so there we were in china 
just friends having dinner 
and it turned out to be julia 
lt turned out to be julia all along 
julia  you are the butter to my bread 
and the breath to my life 
l love you  darling girl 
happy valentine s day 
dear chariie 
julia in front of her stove
has the same fascination for me
as watching a kettie drummer
at the symphony 
the oven door opens and shuts so fast 
you hardiy notice the deff thrust of a spoon
as she dips into a casseroie 
and up to her mouth for a taste check
like a perfectiy timed doubie beat
on the drums 
then with her bare fingers 
she snatches a set of cannelloni
out of the pot of boiiing water 
and she cries 
 these damn things
are as hot as a stiff cock  
 she said what 
 i know 
 julia child said   hot as a      
 i know  i m shocked 
it s from a letter that paul child
wrote to his twin brother charlie in 1 949  
when julia was just starting classes
at le cordon bleu 
so julia and paul  beaucoup  beaucoup 
 i know  just goes to show you 
 what 
you can never tell about
a person s sex life by looking at them 
they were so in love

who are sort of connected to me 
they need me in some way 
like  if i didn t write 
they would really be upset 
they d probably take  like  poison 
try to kill themselves 
julia 
are you still making hats 
oh  no  i abandoned it 
but i am ready to graduate
from the cordon bleu 
i can t get the damn woman
who runs the school to schedule the test 
madame brassart 
is that the woman you are speaking of 
she is a bitch 
she is  you re right 
l think she s almost the only person
in the world i honestly can t stand 
she is not the only person i can t stand 
do you two know each other 
you should  julia child  simone beck 
 simca 
 simca  how do you do 
and this is my friend louisette bertholle 
i can t believe you haven t met 
simca and louisette are writing a cookbook 
 for americans 
 really 
why do you need to take a stupid test 
so i can get a diploma  so i can teach 
you don t need a diploma to teach 
you re probably right 
 avis says the same thing 
 who is avis 
my friend  avis de voto 
who lives in cambridge  massachusetts 
she s very wise 
but i can t help it  i want a diploma 
l am very conventional 
i don t know what to do 
well  why don t you write
to the horrible madame brassart
and threaten her 
threaten her  with what 
the united states of america 
yes 
tell her the american ambassador
personally wants you
to take the examination 
no  no  no  no  no  no 
l couldn t do that  heavens  no 
the american ambassador 
hardly even know the man 
of course you can 
dear madame brassart 
everyone at the american embassy 
inciuding my dear friend the ambassador 
will be very surprised if i m not allowed
to take my examination 
you will write the recipes
for oeufs mollets 
cotelettes de veau en surprise 
et crême renversée au caramei 
cotelettes de veau en surprise 
l had no idea
what veal en surprise was  none 
cooked it in class 
it s a veal chop with mushrooms in a bag 
a paper bag  that s the surprise 
you open the bag  surprise 
veal and mushrooms  it s just
i ve never flunked a test in my entire life 
 i am an a student 
 you can ask to take it again 
 i can 
 of course 
meanwhile  you can come teach with us 
gosh  
is it true you plan to teach 
yes  we re going to teach
americans in paris how to cook 
madame child  i must tell you 
you have no real talent for cooking 
but the americans
will never know the difference 
we are  i am sorry to say  entering aspics 
an aspic is sort of a beef fiavored
jell o moid 
doesn t that sound deiicious 
i can t imagine
why no one makes them anymore 
you begin with a caif s foot 
which i am in possession of
thanks to my sainted husband 
and you boii it untii
your kitchen smells like a tannery 
and then it geis in the refrigerator
and you fiip it onto a piate 
which  according to julia child 
is supposed to be easy 
and all i can say about that 
no offense intended  juiia  is
the bitch iied 
shit 
 shit 
 how many more aspics are there 
seven 
no one wili know if you don t do them 
it s not like there s  like 
the aspic police or something 
you could lie 
i can t  i just can t 
julia wili know  it s like she s watching me 
i m under her influence 
i m becoming a much better person
because of her 
yuck  the sink  look at this 
l hate it here 
did you put something down the sink 
you hate it here 
how am i supposed to cook anything
in this kitchen 
it s no wonder that my mold fell apart 
i don t suppose we have any drano 
not unless you bought it 
i do all of this
and i m supposed to buy drano  too 
right now  you are so
not under the influence of julia child 
what if i don t make my deadline  eric 
i li have wasted a whole year of my life 
l used to be thin and now i m getting fat 
 fat 
 on top of which 
i have to bone a whole duck 
 when 
 at some point 
 can you even conceive of boning a duck 
 no  i can t 
of course you can t 
i m sure you all remember 
because it was oniy a few days ago 
that i had a meitdown over my aspic
and vowed to transform myseif
into a better human being 
and then i was trussing
the poulet rôti à la normande 
which is roast chicken stuffed with
chicken iivers and cream cheese 
and it fell on the fioor and the stuffing
fell out into a big gooey mess 
so  iong story short  another meitdown 
this is crazy 
worse than the iast 
i can t even truss 
and i cried like a small 
emotionally disturbed child 
i m a mess 
l got it  i got it 
hello 
yeah  who s this 
can you hold on just one second 
i m not sure if she s here 
she might ve stepped out  hold on 
hey  it s a reporter from
the christian science monitor 
he wants to write about you 
he does 
l should tell him to call back  right 
no  no  i ll take it 
hello 
yes 
you want to bring who to dinner 
no  of course  i know who that is 
i know exactly who that is 
who  who  who  who  who 
that would be great 
that would be completely amazing 
goodbye 
 who 
 guess who s coming to dinner 
oh  my god 
to les trois gourmandes 
one for all and all for one 
yes 
all right  i had such a horrible time
converting these recipes
from the metric system 
 measurements do not matter 
 oh  but they do 
they absolutely do 
this is one of the biggest arguments
louisette and i had
when we worked on our cookbook 
which is finally finished 
sent off to the publisher 
soon simca and i will be famous 
we ll be the next mrs  joy of cooking 
maybe  all right  well  let s try 
let s just give it a     
can i help 
yeah  lt is mieux 
so  yes  they re early  americans 
dear dorothy 
your sister  juiia  is now a cooking teacher 
we have three students who pay  2 a ciass 
bareiy enough to cover the cost of the food 
but who cares 
simca  louisette  and i
are les trois gourmandes 
aithough sometimes we are oniy
les deux gourmandes
because louisette
turns out to have headaches
and doctor s appointments
she scheduies during ciass 
i have a little headache 
you ll meet them both
when you come here next month 
uniess  of course 
louisette is having a stomachache 
perfection 
and even if it isn t  never apologize 
no excuses  no explanations 
louisette abandoned us 
another stomachache 
and the day before that 
she left class before we even finished
making the chocolate bavarian cream 
i can t believe that s the only time
her dentist could see her 
keep an eye out 
we don t want to miss dorothy 
it s impossible to miss your sister 
i don t see her 
 there she is 
 dorothy 
hi  julia  i missed you  
so good to see     
 paul  
 hi  hi  sweetie 
i ve had an adventure on the ocean liner 
 i didn t get sick once 
 good girl   how about your legs 
people were dropping like flies
all around me 
 look 
 oh  my goodness 
look at that 
all i think about all day is food
and then i dream about it all night 
lt is true  she s obsessed 
if i didn t sit in the kitchen  i d never see her 
last week  i dreamed that
l made cassoulet for dad 
and he hated it  of course 
he doesn t understand any of this 
l almost feel sorry for him 
he wanted so much
for us to stay in pasadena 
marry republicans  and breed like rabbits 
 why didn t we 
 too tall 
let s face it  it s true 
from the beginning 
you just don t fit in  literally 
 so then you don t 
 i know  it s true 
do not bait father about politics
when he comes 
 no 
 or he won t pick up the check 
 he won t  will he 
 i can t make any promises 
 he loves senator mccarthy 
 oh  i know 
 pasadena 
 pasadena 
jinx 
dort  do you have      you have the brie 
 is this the brie 
 yes  yes  that s the brie 
is that not the most wonderful cheese
you ever had in your life 
 yes 
 yes 
the answer s yes 
l got the chef at chez la mère michel
to give me the recipe for beurre blanc 
beurre bianc  what s beurre bianc 
 butter in a white wine vinegar reduction 
 i love butter 
you whisk them together 
and the acid in the vinegar
works on the milk solids in the butter
so that the butter  instead of melting 
becomes this
creamy  light  frothy 
with kind of a fantastic subtle kind of     
tangy 
lt has a tanginess 
tanginess 
yes 
well  that s     
that s who i married 
anyway 
you serve it on fish and it s splendid 
i m going to make it for you 
 that ll be divine 
 yeah 
and  dort  we re going to throw you a party 
 really 
 very exciting 
by the way  there s a man
that i want to introduce you to 
i think you ll really     
he s     
tall  he s very tall 
 pardon 
 tall  he s very 
 extremely tall 
 i m extremely tall 
 but he s even taller  so that s good 
 he is even taller 
well  that s good 
all right 
pretty good 
but not great 
hello  ladies  anybody want anything 
yes 
help yourself  the tapenade is marvelous 
julia  there you are 
john  
there you are 
now  where is this sister of yours 
she s right over there  hi  john 
 hi  paul 
 there 
so we ve told her a lot about you 
well  i don t want to
interrupt her conversation 
with lvan cousins  they just met 
i can t imagine dorothy running off
with lvan cousins 
dearly beloved     
john  this is lovely 
i ve never been to a wedding like this before 
here  julia 
 what a beautiful wedding 
 thanks  pops 
l am not enthusiastic about this marriage 
well  you weren t very enthusiastic
about ours  either 
true 
how are things at the embassy  paul 
fine  thank you  phila  thank you 
well  not fine  really  because
they ve cut our library allowance by 90  
lt seems that senator mccarthy
has very long arms 
senator mccarthy is a man
who knows his mind 
l admire a man who knows his mind 
well  we know lots of people in washington
who have lost their jobs 
after years in government service 
for no reason whatsoever 
and paul had to make a list of
every single book in the embassy library 
surely you re not suggesting that
the french government is any better 
 and     
 shall we dance 
come on  dance with me 
excuse us 
you said you didn t want to talk about it 
then you went and talked about it 
i know  i never learn 
where s my big sprig 
up here  whipping away 
and for dinner  mayonnaise 
 that s good 
 that is good  isn t it 
 very  from your sister 
 i m going to send this recipe to avis 
i m very excited about it 
 i think it s a breakthrough 
 well  it tastes like it 
dorothy is pregnant 
paul 
lsn t that wonderful 
yes 
okay 
 i m so happy 
 i know 
i know 
if you warm the bowl slightly
before you beat in the egg yolk 
it changes everything 
foolproof mayonnaise  absolutely foolproof 
l typed it up 
 you disagree 
 about the mayonnaise  not at all 
i m sure you re exactly right 
scientific workability  that s my motto 
julia 
we have a little problem 
 our editor     
 for our cookbook 
     thinks our book is not in english 
but your book is in english 
they are giving it a rejection 
but they suggest that
if we are continuing with it 
we should get a collaborator
who could take what we have
and make it work for american cooks 
would you do it  julia 
would i do it 
yes 
we are now going to piay a round of
 guess who s coming to dinner  
this wednesday  i am going to be
piaying host to a distinguished guest 
ciue number one 
the degree of separation
between julia child and me
is about to shrink
by a factor of about a thousand 
a thousand 
in answer to your questions  no  it is not
amanda hesser ofthe new york times
or nigella lawson  or ina garten 
but here s ciue number two 
i will be making boeuf bourguignon 
which was the first dish
our distinguished guest cooked
upon reading mastering the art
of french cooking for the first time 
boeuf bourguignon 
julia child s boeuf bourguignon 
well  since no one guessed my mystery
guest  i m going to have to tell you all 
it s judith jones 
the editor who s responsibie
for getting juiia s cookbook pubiished
way back when 
the woman who recognized history
in an onionskin manuscript 
she s oider and probabiy not used to
eating at 1 0 00 at night 
which is why i m being diiigent about this
and making the stew the night before 
and as i cook it 
i aimost feei as if julia and i
are communicating over space and time
on a deep  spirituai  mysticai ievei 
aithough  mostiy  i m just taiking to myseif 
 how long does it take to cook 
 two and a haif hours 
weicome 
i m julia child 
and today we re going to make
a holiday foast  or les fètes d holiday 
and we re going to start with haif boned
chicken or poularde demi désossée 
now  first  remove the iiver and fry it up
with some onions for a iittie snack
or perhaps a deiicious iiverwurst
which you can spread on a cracker 
a ritz cracker  a saitine 
saltine 
or if you have a pet  a cat or a dog 
they love iiver 
save the iiver 
 save the liver 
 save the liver 
now  you piace the chicken on its stomach
and cut aiong the backbone
to the pope s nose  like so 
crack 
now i ve done it 
i ve cut the dickens out of my finger 
well  i m giad  in a way  this happened 
you know  accidents do occur
from time to time in the kitchen 
we ve never really discussed what to do 
first  you must stop the bieeding 
the best way is with direct pressure
on the apron  like so 
you want to raise your hand over your head 
i recommend naturai coaguiants 
such as chicken iiver 
another reason not to throw away the iiver 
oh  god  it s throbbing 
a tourniquet  that s it 
why are you all spinning 
well  i think i m going to go to sieep now 
bon appétit 
no  no  no 
well  it s just a big  dry collection
of recipes 
it doesn t work at all 
i m just gonna have to throw
most of it out and start all over again  
this has got to be a cookbook
that makes french cooking accessible
to americans who do not have cooks 
who are servantless 
is that a word 
servantless 
i think it is a word 
julia 
 what if we had to leave paris 
 why would we have to leave paris 
because my assignment was for four years 
so then we still have time 
eight months 
and this cookbook is not something
you can finish in eight months 
no  but two years seems possible 
julia 
what if they transfer me someplace else 
would they do that 
yes 
they don t really care about me 
paul  of course they do 
they don t  really 
well  if we can t stay in paris 
then i ll just mail the pages
to louisette and simca
and they can mail them back to me 
that s why they invented the mail system
and carbon paper and onionskin copies 
or i can just jump on the train to paris
whenever the three of us
absolutely have to work together  you know 
or the two of us  actually  because as
we know  louisette does next to nothing 
but we would still be somewhere in europe 
don t you think 
it s very hard to say 
given the current political climate 
senator mccarthy
does not like people like us 
us  why  what have we done 
we haven t done anything 
that s not the point 
the point is  we were in china 
and that s practically sufficient 
well  meanwhile  we re still here 
 yes  we are  you re right 
 yes 
here s to the book 
french cooking for all 
or french home cooking 
do you like that  which one do you like 
i like them both 
dear avis  enciosed is part of our cookbook
from the chapter on sauces 
naturally  it must not be shown to anyone
uniess you are sure they are not 
never have been 
and won t have anything to do
with the pubiishing business 
there are peopie
who wouid love nothing more
than to steai this hollandaise recipe 
we re late  do you suppose she ll be there 
louisette  of course she ll be there 
it s at her house 
l was making a little joke 
 what s this about  anyway 
 louisette wouldn t tell me 
she said it was a surprise 
maybe she s dropping out of the project 
that would be heavenly 
 julia 
 well  it would 
my friends  this is lrma rombauer 
mrs  joy 
the first edition of the joy of cooking
took me a year to write 
only a year  lncluding testing the recipes 
well  i didn t really test all the recipes 
there were so many of them 
and then i found a publisher 
a small printer in st  louis 
how much money did he pay you 
l paid him   3 000  
  3 000 
 a small fortune 
but i had a little life insurance money
because my husband     
 no 
 he killed himself 
yes 
and i thought   well  what else am l
gonna do with the insurance money  
and then  the book began to sell
and bobbs merrill picked it up 
so now i had a real publisher 
and they gave you some money 
absolutely not 
they swindled me  they stole my copyright 
and now there s a new edition 
and guess what 
 what 
 the index is a complete calamity 
if you re looking for city chicken 
you re not gonna find it under  c   
really 
it s under  drumsticks  mock  
no 
all she wanted to talk about
was how her publisher had cheated her
out of thousands of dollars in royalties 
lt just made me realize this     
not going to be simple 
this getting published business 
this is from avis  for you 
oh  my  well 
what does she say now 
avis loves my sauce chapter 
that s wonderful  darling 
oh  no 
she showed it to someone 
which i specifically asked her not to do 
she showed it to an editor
at houghton mifflin in boston 
and the boston editor showed it
to the head of publishing and     
paul   paul  
yes  what  what  what  what  what 
they want to     
they want to publish our book 
that s great news 
and they want to give us an advance 
how much 
  250 
 no 
and when the book is finished   500 more 
i m so proud of you 
the editor loves the book 
she just loves it 
 so with the smell of burned stew
still in the air 
 l woke up dying of stomach cramps 
 l called in sick  
and went back to bed for several hours 
put it in  put it in the blog in case
someone in your office reads it 
and went back to bed for several hours 
by noon  i was somehow abie to
straighten myseif up to a standing position 
what are you making 
bought the ingredients for
boeuf bourguignon all over again 
boeuf bourguignon 
dragged myseif home 
and made another boeuf bourguignon 
and for dessert  a raspberry bavarian cream 
by the end of the day  i feit fine 
i was cooking dinner for a iegend 
even though i d never really heard of her
untii a few months ago 
maybe she ll offer you a book contract 
what if she does 
i mean  what would that mean 
that would mean i might be a writer 
how much money
do people make for books 
like an advance  i have no idea 
  1 00  000 
 don t even say it 
hello 
hi 
i know  i know  i know 
lt is here  too  cats and dogs 
i know 
well  thanks 
bye 
so not coming 
that was the guy
from the christian science monitor 
it s raining 
and we live in long lsland city
and she s  like  older 
it s mortitying 
but on the bright side  more stew for us 
just for once  could you not
look on the bright side 
yeah  well  it s not the end of the world 
l thought  i really did think  i just did 
l thought  book contract  
me  judith jones  happily ever after 
and then we d have a little money
and we wouldn t live over a pizzeria
for the rest of our lives 
how am i gonna explain this 
my readers are gonna be really upset 
they were so into it 
 your readers are gonna be really upset 
 i never should ve told everyone 
they ll live 
somehow 
your readers will live 
 is it bland 
 not anymore 
thank you for telling me that 
you almost let me feed judith jones
bland boeuf bourguignon 
this is a nightmare 
l told everyone she was coming 
they will survive 
and when this year s over 
and i cannot wait until it is 
your readers will somehow
get on with their lives 
 and i won t  is that what you re saying 
 i don t know  i have no idea 
i mean  what s gonna happen when
you re no longer the center of the universe 
that s just great 
l am finally totally engaged in something 
okay  maybe i m being a little narcissistic 
a little  on a scale of 1 0 
okay  a 9  3  but what do you think a blog is 
it s me  me  me day after day 
l thought it d be fun  how stupid is that 
lt just turns out to be a lot of
what you call  meltdowns  
but they don t feel like meltdowns 
they feel like i m living with
a totally self absorbed person
who writes this stuff
for a bunch of complete strangers 
and it s supposed to be a big adventure 
but it s not 
it s our life  it s our marriage 
and  here  in this room  it doesn t
feel like an adventure  it feels like shit 
 lt was your idea 
 i know  i m so sorry 
what the hell was i thinking 
and i ll tell you something else 
l am not a saint 
 yes  you are 
 no  i m not 
 yes  you are 
 no  i m not 
and it makes me feel like an asshole
every time you say it 
and do not write about this in your blog 
 about what 
 about this fight 
i m outta here 
 you all right  julia 
 yes  fine 
i m perfectly fine 
dear avis  we finished packing today 
and tomorrow we ieave beloved paris
for marseilles 
paui has been appointed cuiturai affairs
commissioner for the south of france 
i m having a hard time pretending to be
anything but devastated 
i m going to go buy some bread 
the advantage of marseilles is that
it won t have the distractions of paris 
so we ll be abie to finish the book 
aithough not on deadiine 
at ieast we re still in france 
dear avis  i don t know
what we ve done to deserve it
but here we are in germany 
actually in a suburb of bonn
called piittersdorf on the rhine 
which sounds much more picturesque
than it is 
by the way  there is no chance
we ll meet our new deadiine 
we ll be at ieast two more years 
meanwhiie  paui has been
called to washington 
we have no idea why 
well  they re going to promote you  finally 
they have to 
well  i don t know why they have to call me
back to washington to tell me that 
they could just send a telex 
lt d be a lot cheaper 
well  they re going to reassign you  then 
they ll ask you whether
you prefer paris or paris 
it s a possibility 
it s not likely  but it is a possibility 
and if they are moving us back to paris 
i can look for an apartment
when i m there next week 
good idea  yes 
l promise i ll call you the minute they tell me
we re being transferred back to paris 
all right 
all right 
 i know  darling  i know 
 i think it could happen 
lt could happen  i know 
stay right there  that s perfect 
 say cheese  ducky 
 move your hand 
 good  great 
 put your legs together  darling 
it s very simple 
we re just going to tell her she should have
a smaller share of the royalties
because it is clear she can t put in the 40
hours a week you and i are spending on it 
 sixty is more like it  eighty 
 exactly 
 you and i are vaches enragees 
 that s exactly what we are  mad cows 
but i can t bring myself
to say this to louisette 
 you re going to have to do it 
 i wili do it  we must be cold blooded 
l shall love her much more
when this is settled 
lt isn t that you re not helping
to some extent 
but i am helping 
lt was my idea to add peas
to the coq au vin recipe 
we know  and that was a wonderful idea 
but the book has become a magnum opus 
but we are a team 
we are les trois gourmandes  one for all 
yes  it s absolutely true  louisette 
yes  it s true 
and you have been very valuable
to the project 
thank you 
but     
l am getting a divorce 
 what 
 jean luc is leaving me 
i m so sorry  louisette 
just forget that i even mentioned it 
but it isn t fair for louisette to get
the same amount of money that we do 
simca  this is not the time to discuss this 
she s getting a divorce 
but she doesn t do the work 
you don t do the work 
so your share should be 1 0  
ten percent 
you re not doing the work 
twenty five 
 fifteen 
 twenty 
eighteen and not a penny more 
and where it says our names 
l think it should say 
 by julia child and simone beck 
with louisette bertholle  
  with  
 and in smaller type 
no  no  no  no  simca 
our names exactly the      exactly     
and alphabetical  alphabetical 
but it was not even her idea
to put the peas in the coq au vin 
 no 
 but it bothers me 
for me 
dear avis  we ve been through
our own version of kafka 
paui went off to washington 
and in my innocence
i thought it must be because
the united states government
had finally reaiized how vaiuabie he was 
far from it  he was being investigated 
he spent three days being grilled
in a windowiess room
with a foot high stack of papers
ominousiy sitting on the tabie 
they asked him about our friends 
our books 
our china years  our patriotism 
they even asked him
if he was a homosexuai 
 are you a homosexual  mr  child 
 no 
l am not a homosexual 
this is not a joke 
i m well aware of that 
he came home exonerated
but thoroughiy bruised 
julia  it was a nightmare 
what am i going to do 
l feel like my entire life has been a waste 
 paul 
 i have one more posting 
then i ll retire and then what 
we ll figure it out 
l just don t know what it was all for 
you know 
you at least have the book 
well  it s your book  too 
lt is 
without you  it wouldn t be a book 
not that simca and i ll ever be done with it 
 someday you ll be done with it 
 i m beginning to wonder 
so to wrap things up 
at 6 22 iast night 
guess who wasn t coming to dinner 
that s right 
it began pouring down rain
and judith jones canceied 
i was utteriy crushed 
and then on top of everything 
i had a horribie fight with my husband
and he ieff me 
the boeuf bourguignon was delloicus 
not that i ate it 
as for the raspberry bavarian cream 
i am taking it to the office 
morning 
julie  could you come in here 
l didn t tell him  i swear 
julie 
 feeling better 
 much 
so you burned the stew 
but that s not why i didn t come to work 
l didn t come to work because i had     
stomach flu 
listen  it s a free country 
but this little thing of yours on the lnternet 
i do not want to show up in it  okay 
and if you don t feel like coming in to work 
let me know 
somebody wili want this job 
we re trying to do something here 
i m sorry 
anyone else would fire you 
a republican would fire you 
i m not a schmuck 
i m in shock  i can t believe it 
you re like  the ones   if you and eric
can t make it work  who can 
all sorts of people can 
just not me because i am a bitch 
l am  sarah  i m a bitch 
i know  i know you are 
by the way  garth and i broke up 
oh  god  i didn t even ask 
l am a one way street  just like eric says 
it s okay  i wasn t in love with him 
do you really think i m a bitch 
 well  yeah 
 i know 
but who isn t 
julia 
i ve been thinking about me and juiia 
she was a secretary
for a government agency and i am  too 
a really nice guy married her 
a really nice guy married me 
both of us were iost
and both of us were saved
by food in some way or other 
so major overiaps 
but let s face it  i am not julia child 
julia child never iost her temper
just because something boiied over 
or collapsed in the oven 
or just piain fell through 
and she was never horribie to her husband 
i m sure 
and she never behaved like 
 who has time to be married  
which is how i behave sometimes 
i m sorry to say 
i wish i were more like her 
she deserved her husband and i don t 
that s the truth 
well  anyway  that s the truth for now 
yogurt for dinner 
hi  you ve reached eric powell at
archaeology magazine  leave a message 
i hated sieeping without you iast night 
where are you 
l miss you 
 hello 
 honey  is something wrong 
no 
why would you think that 
are you and eric

i just read your biog  and it was strange
and uncharacteristically thoughtfui 
 where is he

he went out to get pizza 
have you stopped cooking 
just temporarily 
just taking a little break from cooking 
well  get back to it 
it s gonna be good for you to finish
something for once in your iife 
 julia didn t give up 
 who says i m giving up 
well  i m just saying don t 
hey

please be back 
what s for dinner 
well  avis said she d be here 
even if we were late 
well  if she s not here  we can take a taxi 
they probably have taxis in boston 
she ll be here  wearing a plaid jacket 
that s how i m to recognize her 
what do you mean   recognize her  
has she changed 
well     
 look for the middle aged woman
in a plaid jacket  
 so     
 you and avis have never met 
we re just pen pals 
you don t know each other 
well  we do  we write 
but how did you start writing one another 
that s a long story 
avis  husband  bernard de voto  now dead 
was a wonderful  wonderful writer 
he wrote an article in harper s magazine
all about stainless steel knives
 and how he absolutely detested them 
 yes 
and so i wrote him a fan letter
because he was 1 00  right
and avis wrote me back 
and so i wrote her back 
and she wrote me back 
well  it s been eight years  i think 
 avis 
 julia 
 my darling friend 
 look at you 
brilliant friend  bless you 
this is a very impressive undertaking 
mrs  child and mrs  beck 
well  thank you very  very much 
and your editor loves it 
i do  i think it s brilliant 
there s really nothing else like it
on the market 
 the problem is not just the length 
 it s 700 pages 
 yes  we know  lt is long 
 yes  we know it s long 
you have 700 pages
of just sauce and poultry recipes 
we were thinking that you could publish it
in a series of volumes 
volume one  sauces 
 volume two     
 poultry 
yes 
volume three  fish 
meat  vegetables  and desserts 
that s one  two  three      that s six volumes 
eggs 
 eggs 
 eggs  seven  seven volumes 
but we don t want to publish
an encyclopedia 
l thought this was intended for housewives 
yes  housewives want something quick 
with a mix 
like this 
but if i may speak for everyone 
if you were willing to revise it 
i m sure we would all be interested 
simca  i am so sorry 
you just picked the wrong collaborator 
yes  i should have worked with this woman 
 baked alaska in a flower pot  
we ll just take the book away from
houghton mifflin and find another publisher 
we have just begun to fight 
julia  your book is a masterpiece 
what is marshmallow fluff 
and keep the advance  by the way 
keep the entire  250  
don t give them back a penny of it 
why did we ever decide to do this anyway 
what were we thinking 
who can remember 
i can 
we wanted to write a french cookbook
for american women who do not have cooks 
so then  that s what we li do 
we ll just do it all over again 
and that s that  lt ll be easy 
it will  the dessert section is done 
thanks to simca  it is brilliant 
thank you 
i just haven t typed it up yet 
but that will give me something to do
in oslo 
eric  come see
the world s most beautiful chicken 
naughty 
wow  
oh  my god 
lt feels so good  no  i m serious  i love it 
l just want to savor this moment 
the moment when anything is possible 
the moment that you can just imagine
they re going to love everything you did
and it s going to sell a million copies
and change the world 
yes  but i think
it calls for a great bottle of wine 
 don t you think 
 yes 
what s for dinner 
what if she doesn t eat pork 
she s a food writer  of course she eats pork 
you ll be fine  you ll be fine 
you re right  i know you re right 
i m sure you re right 
 ls she early 
 she s right on time 
 i ll finish  i ll finish 
 thank you  thank you

amanda hesser from the new york times

in the kitchen

although  i don t think she ever reads it 
i don t know 
i m dying to meet her 
i would like to be a bridesmaid
in her wedding in 1 946

terrible title 
have fun  judith 
yum 
oh  my 
 here it is  of course 
 what     
 who s that 
 i don t know 
special delivery for mrs  julia child 
chilly 
there you are 
dear mrs  child 
we have read your superb french cookbook 
studying it  cooking from it 
estimating  and so on 
and we have come to the conciusion
that it is a unique book
that we wouid be very proud to pubiish 
paul   paul  
what  what  what  what  what 
knopf     
knopf wants to publish our book 
is it  k nopf  or  nopf  
 who cares 
 who cares 
they want to offer us an advance of  1  500  
oh  my god 
 we believe that your book wili do
for french cooking in america
 what rombauer s the joy of cooking did
for standard cooking 
 and we will sell it that way  
julia 
when we meet 
which i hope will be very soon 
i especially wanna taik to you
about the titie of the book 
because it is of the utmost importance
that the titie distinguish this book
from all the other cookbooks on the market 
 is this the way you normally do this 
 absolutely not 
 mastering the art of french cooking  
what do you think 
well  at this point 
i have no idea whatsoever 
 julia  that won t do 
 all right  then 
l love it 
she said  hate  
julia child used the word  hate  
no 
but she said i wasn t respectful 
or serious  or something 
how much more serious could a person be 
do you think
she thinks i m sort of using her 
she can t have read your blog 
did she read it 
he didn t know if she d read it 
but she definitely had an opinion about it 
do you think it s because i use
the  f  word every so often 
could be  who knows 
look  there s something wrong with her
if she doesn t get what you re doing 
there is nothing wrong with her  nothing 
i ve spent a year with her  she s perfect 
the julia child in your head is perfect 
the julia child that doesn t understand
what you re doing is not perfect 
the one in your head is the one that matters 
i m never gonna meet her 
but you already know her 
 thank you 
 you re welcome  anytime 
 she saved me 
 you saved yourself 
i was drowning
and she pulled me out of the ocean 
don t get carried away 
julia child began iearning to cook
because she loved her husband 
and she loved food 
and she didn t know
what eise to do with herseif 
and  in the process  she found joy 
i didn t understand this for a iong time 
but i do now 
julia taught me that 
but here s what julia really taught me 
so here we are 
one day to go and one recipe 
you may think that boning a duck
is an impossibie feat 
 and the whoie procedure   
 nothing is impossible 
   can take as iong as 45 minutes
the first time because of fear 
don t be afraid 
no fear  julia  no fear 
take your knife  confront the duck 
confronting the duck  you re my duck 
you make a deep siit
down the back of the bird
all the way from the neck down to the taii
to expose the backbone 
and with a small  sharp knife 
its edge aiways cutting against the bone   
i did it  look at that  julia 
it looks just like yours 
   down one side of the bird   
   pulling the fiesh 
thread the boned duck on a board 
face skin side down 
   patting it into piace  roll out the dough 
   two hours and remove it from the oven
and let it cooi for severai hours 
lt looks exactly the way
it s supposed to look
