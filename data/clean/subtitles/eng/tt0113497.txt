to the cliffside school for boys 
  there 
  congratulations  sweetheart 
  you don t want me living here anymore 
  alan 
it s always been the plan that you go
to cliffside when you were ready 
i mean  parrishes have been going
to cliffside ever since the 1700s 
even your uncle skylar
went there 
  look at this  parrish hall 
  it s the main dormitory 
oh  this is great  kids are on my
case here because i m a parrish 
just wait till i m living in
a building named after me 
it was named
after my father 
  good  why don t you live in it

i wouldn t be who i am today
if it weren t for my years there 
maybe i don t wanna be who you are 
maybe i don t wanna be a parrish 
you won t be 
not till you start acting like one

we ll talk about this some other time 
what was that 
  you heard it too 
  of course i heard it 
come on  i found this weird game
in the factory 
a game 
 jumanji 
a game for those who seek to find
a way to leave their world behind 
you roll the dice to move your token 
doubles gets another turn 
and the first player to reach
the end wins   you wanna play 
i quit playing board games
five years ago 
sarah 
  it s gotta be magnetized or something 
  alan  look 
 at night they fly 
you better run   
these winged things
are not much fun  
  what was that 
  i don t know 
  put it away  alan 
  okay 
oh  no 
the game thinks i rolled 
what do you mean 
 the game thinks  
 in the jungle you must wait   
until the dice
read five or eight  
 in the jungle you must wait   
what s that mean 
roll the dice 
i think a bed and breakfast
is just what this town needs 
well  it s pretty hard to pass up 
especially full of furniture 
oh  boy  i keep forgetting
how big this place is 
judy  peter 
come look at this 
i m gonna put
a reception area over here 
and a bar over here
in the parlor 
that sounds lovely  i m sure you and
your kids are gonna be very happy here 
oh  well  actually 
they re my late brother s 
he and his wife passed away
just last winter 
is this something 
or what 
it sure is 
so  what do you think  young man 
is it big enough for you 
peter hasn t spoken a word
since it happened 
oh  my  i m so sorry 
how terribly awful 
it s okay 
we barely even knew our parents 
they were always away   skiing in
saint moritz  gambling in monte carlo   
seafaring in darkest africa 
we didn t even know
if they loved us 
but when the sheik s yacht
went down  well   
they managed to write us
a really beautiful good bye note   
that was found floating in
a champagne bottle amongst the debris 
excuse me 
they were very devoted parents 
it was a car crash in canada 
  so you ll send me those escrow papers 
  first thing tomorrow 
i ll have to get a locksmith
out for this one 
peter  pick up your toys 
please 
peter  take this suitcase
up to the attic 
then we can all have
ice cream and bourbon 
what  what is it 
  i m going to motel 6 
  oh  for heaven s sake 
i don t see any guano 
  he said it looked like that 
  that s an african bat 
some kid said she saw a bunch
of those back in the  60s 
but we don t get bats
like that in new england 
  but that s what he saw 
  well  whatever it was   
is gone now 
bats aren t what i d worry about
in this house any ways 
what would you worry about 
well  personally   
i wouldn t wanna live in a house
where someone was murdered 
  murdered 
  yep 
little alan parrish 
i say his father did it 
there s a thousand and one places he
could have hid the body in this house 
especially if he
chopped it up first 
hey  up there  you kids don t wanna
be late for your first day of school 
  not a bat in sight  ma am 
  ya hear that 
there is nothing
to be afraid of in this house 
i can t believe i have to see
your principal after the first day 
what am i gonna do 
let s just try to relax and finish our
dinner and talk about something else 
well  we found out why
you got this house so cheap 
twenty six years ago  a kid named
alan parrish used to live here 
then one day 
he just disappeared   
 cause his parents chopped him up in
little pieces and hid him in the walls 
okay  that s it  i am sick and tired of
your lies  young lady  you re grounded 
fine  there s nowhere to go
in this stupid town anyway 
and just for your information 
that wasn t a lie 
did you hear anything
a little while ago 
do you miss mom and dad 
  no 
  liar 
if you don t cut that out 
they re gonna send you to a shrink 
where do you think they re gonna
send you if you don t start talking

your house keys

weird  they re stuck 
 jumanji  a game for those who seek to
find a way to leave their world behind 
you roll the dice to move your token 
doubles get another turn 
the first player
to reach the end wins  
it s gotta be microchips
or something 
you go first 
okay 
six 
 a tiny bite can make you itch 
make you sneeze  make you twitch  
don t 
 this will not be
an easy mission   
monkeys slow the expedition  
what is that 
i bet those monkeys came from the game 
the mosquitoes too 
uh oh 
i didn t see this part 
 adventurers beware  
 adventurers beware  do not begin
unless you intend to finish 
the exciting consequences
of the game will vanish   
only when a player has reached
jumanji and called out its name  
  the monkeys are gone 
  good 
  put it away 
  wait 
the instructions say if we
finish the game  it ll all go away 
we better do it 
or aunt nora s gonna pitch a fit 
we should just get through it quickly 
i mean  there s no skill involved 
no  you rolled doubles 
you get another turn

 in the jungle you must wait 
till the dice read five or eight  
i was a little girl  alan 
you disappeared 
and a bunch of bats surrounded me
and chased me down the street 
i was afraid 
i m sorry  alan 
no one believed me 
i was all alone

  come on  sarah 
  please 
i knew this was
gonna be a bad day 
hey  come on

the darkest wild   
makes you feel
just like a child  
  what is it 
  van pelt 
you miserable coward 
come back and face me like a man 
not good enough  sonny jim 
coming  ready or not 
hey  you  
drop your gun and get
your hands in the air 
man  i don t believe this 
even if alan gets out of this 
the same kind of thing s   
gonna happen over and over again 
when you carry around so much anger 
it attracts a lot of negative energy 
and things happen  like ending up
in the jungle  that was no accident 
  there are no accidents 
  whose turn is it 
  it s my turn 
  really  great 
you might have told us there was a man
in there with a rifle that hunts people 
i didn t know  okay 
it s just the roll of the dice 
is he the reason
you didn t wanna play 
you didn t wanna play either   
mr  we started something 26 years ago 
and now we gotta finish it 
  what s the deal with you and this guy 
  he s a hunter 
he kills things  right now 
he wants to hunt me and kill me 
  why you 
  why me  i don t know 
everything about me he finds offensive 
you think it d be a waste of his time 
  maybe he needs something for his wall 
  it s your turn 
you ever thought about sitting down
and talking about your differences 
what  are you crazy 
the man has a gun 
don t ever call me crazy  alan 
ever   cause everyone in this town
has called me crazy   
ever since i told the cops
you were sucked into a board game
