most daring
thefts of modern times
fowl is said
to be hiding ancient relics
worth hundreds of millions of
time and again
these museums
were robbed of untold riches
some say the true amount stolen
may never be known
where i am amidst
what can only be described
as a media frenzy
he couldnt dismiss the fact
that when he was arrested
the collection contains
the rarest evidence
of ancient worlds
most expressed horror at his
alleged criminal activity
while others hinted at a more
widespread conspiracy
many similarities
to numerous daring thefts
shrouded in mystery
a crowd has gathered
its him its him
breaking news
there is the car
yes the car has come down
and it looks like
young artemis fowl is here
authorities
have now made connections
to one man
artemis fowl
breaking news now
and a suspected accomplice
of artemis fowl
is today arrested
near fowl manor
help me
is this
unidentified individual a link
to artemis fowl
and the multiple thefts
we have reports
that british intelligence
authorities
are expected to question
the subject immediately
is it true
do you have anything to say
artemis
how does it feel
to have a criminal
for a father artemis
your name
mulch diggums
exactly what were you doing
near fowl manor
so now its illegal
to go for a hike
this was no hike
unless you tell us exactly
what happened at fowl manor
you will be
permanently imprisoned
wait wait wait
you dont want me
no no im just
a talented tunneler
you want the brains
of the operation
the one who stole the aculos
what precisely is the aculos
the aculos
a weapon
so powerful and mysterious
it can barely be imagined
youre lying
look i know
you dont believe my story
but i can prove it
mr diggums
i highly doubt that
you will see
all i see is
that there was some highly
unusual seismic activity
around fowl manor
and reports from a crazed
fisherman of fairies
well maybe the fisherman saw
something he wasnt meant to
its fantasy
whats reality is that
you are a common thief
who is somehow in league
with a quite uncommon thief
we want to know everything
about the man you work for
the man
no
this isnt about the father
this is about the son
the son
do not underestimate the kid
let me show you
the infinite possibilities
of magic
let me tell you
the story of artemis fowl
a story that begins where
every great story begins
in a place where magic
and wonder still exist
the most magical place on earth
ireland
home of artemis fowl
artemis loved ireland
the sea and the land
not so much the school
you see he just didnt need it
when he was seven
he beat european
chess champion evan rashoggi
in five moves
when he was nine he won
the architectural competition
to design
the dublin opera house
when he was ten
he cloned a goat
and named it bruce
weird choice
but hes an unusual kid
good
and you know
when youre that unusual
youre going to stick out
well artemis
lets talk shall we
certainly sir
i can see
youre admiring my chair
its a family heirloom
grandfather acquired it
from sothebys
william and mary period
1689 to 1702
as im sure you know
impressive
once in use at the palace
buckingham palace
queens favorite chair
apparently
now artemis
there is a problem
the problem is that
i know the textbook reply
to any question
you may choose to ask
the problem is that you dont
respect anyone enough
to treat them as an equal
thats ridiculous
i hold several people
in the very highest esteem
really who for example
albert einstein
his theories
were usually correct
how about someone
you actually know
you seem to have
all the answers doctor
why dont you tell me
well
where shall we start
thats my biography i presume
it is
it explains quite a lot
such as
well firstly
theres your dear mother
of course
who was a wonderful woman
in my opinion
and taken from us far too soon
but who sadly had absolutely
no control over your behavior
then of course
theres your father
and his mysterious absences
from home
this is a sensitive area
doctor
but do you think
thats why you are as you are
no
and by the way i didnt know
they allowed fakes
at the palace
fake
its clever
ill give you that
but look at these
furniture tacks
crisscross pattern on the head
machinetooled
makes it 1890s at the earliest
your grandfather was duped
artemis
youre lashing out at me
but i think i know
what this is really about
is it because of the burden
of your fathers name
no
its because
im forced to endure
this ridiculous therapy
artemis
look just who do you think
you are
but of course
artemis wasnt on his own
even if it may have seemed
that way sometimes
for if there was one thing
artemis liked
more than his own company
it was being at home
with his dad
artemis fowl sr
a dealer
of antiques and rarities
and just about
every irish fairy tale
you might care to imagine
theyre trained in the art of
except that
you didnt have to imagine
for artemis sr
taught artemis jr
everything there was to know
about the leprechauns
and the banshees
and the sprites and the goblins
so much so that you might
even have thought
that artemis sr believed
in the legends
of the little people
he certainly shared
his passion with his son
on the rare occasions
when he wasnt away from home
but while he was there
he was absolutely determined
to have artemis know
all that could be known
about the fairies
to prepare the boy for a day
that would come much sooner
than anyone expected
did i ever tell you
how all those fairy stones
got to come to fowl manor
thousands of years ago
this is where
the peace was made
after the war
between the human world
and the tuatha de danaan
a human and a fairy met
just tell me
when youre leaving
the helicopters
being prepared
for me right now son
im sorry
ill be back as soon as i can
thats what you said
the last time
and the time before
i know arty
theres just one very
important thing i have to do
and i know its been hard
but look
my work is coming to an end
and like the stories you know
they all have an ending
that just
well it makes you smile
and this one
will be no different
and when it ends
a new story will begin
and maybe
just maybe
itll be yours
im not a kid anymore dad
well you used to
believe in magic
you believed in the goblins
and you believed in the trolls
you believed in everything
i told you
about the hill of tara
all i really want
is to believe in you
okay
come here son
i love you son
more than you could ever know
then take me with you
youre all i have now arty
let me keep you safe
for a little longer
come on
and remember
until i see you again
may the road rise up
to meet you
may the wind
be always at your back
may the sun shine
warm upon your face
may the rain fall soft
upon your fields
and until we meet again
may a friend be always near
good night son
good night dad
what are you talking about
yes he took off yesterday
as planned
what do you mean
he never arrived
the boat was empty
have you checked the manifest
how long
before the media have it
i dont know youd better
make some inquiries
domovoi butler
friend mentor bodyguard
ten years of martial arts
training in kyoto
seven years of
weapons training in moscow
six years of strength training
at golds gym in venice
california
and under no circumstances
were you to ever call him
the butler
even though his last name
was in fact butler
you could call him dom
or domovoi
or very large man in a suit
but call him the butler
and hed snap you in half
not always sunny though
there will be some cloud
thatll bring a few drizzles
now and again
especially along the western
and northern coast
now back to our main story
authorities today launched
a worldwide manhunt
for artemis fowl
a reclusive businessman
but now
a controversial public figure
whose superyacht the owl star
was found abandoned last night
in the south china seas
fowl is a known collector
and antiquities dealer
but in dramatic new revelations
he is also suspected
to have been behind
some of the biggest robberies
of the past 10 years
including the disappearance
of the priceless rosetta stone
from the british museum
the irreplaceable 14th century
borus harp
and the iconic book of kells
from trinity college dublin
no sign of struggle was found
aboard the owl star
and her owners fate
is entirely unknown
investigations are ongoing
but until further news
of his whereabouts
can be established
doubts will remain
my dad
artemis
where is he dom
we dont know
i have people on the way
to the wreck as we speak
and the remaining question
artemis fowl
antiquities dealer
or criminal mastermind
how dare they
hes not a criminal
hes my dad
hes my dad
dad
artemis dont answer the phone
artemis
dad
hello dad
hello
artemis jr i presume
i have your father
what who is this
is this a hoax
if you have my father
i want proof
then you shall have some
dad dad
artemis
artemis
you listen to me son
you stay out of this
okay do you hear me
theres no way you can help me
its too big
everything ive told you
is true its all true
your father stole something
from me and hid it
my enemies have prevented me
from retrieving it myself
you will do so on my behalf
find the aculos or you will
never see him again
artemis
whats the aculos
youre a clever boy
youll work it out
you have three days
artemis what did they say
word for word
whoever it was
man woman
i couldnt tell
but they were asking for
something called the aculos
what is it
artemis get dressed
and come with me
you werent supposed
to see this yet
your father would kill me
if he knew we were here
im showing you
because i have no choice
what is all this
this is where your father
kept his entire lifes work
and his father
and his father before him
its not what it looks like
artemis
everything in this room
was acquired
for a specific reason
sometimes to protect
its secrets
sometimes to keep it from
falling into the wrong hands
these are relics
from another world
i dont understand
i was never meant to share
the details
of your family business
these relics
have been passed down
through the generations
theyre secrets that your father
had intended to share with you
when the time was right
but the fairies are a myth
none of this is actually true
look around you arty
maybe those stories
can help us find him
but where to begin
i dont see anything
about an aculos do you
no
i helped him catalogue
much of this
but he never mentioned
such a thing
and he always shared
his discoveries with me
the only thing he kept private
was his journal
then thats what
we have to find
i wouldnt know
where to begin to look
could your father
have ever given you a clue
as to where to start
he never told me how to start
but he may have told me
how to end
end
yeah
he read the same poem to me
every night before bed
and every time he left
may the road rise up
to meet you
may the wind
be always at your back
may the sun shine
warm upon your face
may the rains fall soft
upon your fields
who wrote this poem arty
nobody knows
thats just it
then how do you find it
its known
as the irish blessing
its a journal
its dads journal
go to the last entry
shes hunting me now
and would kill me to find it
she knows the truth of
what beechwood gave me
before he died
they know
we have the aculos
the voice on the phone
told you to find it
the aculos cannot fall
into the wrong hands
it had to be protected
even from
the fairies themselves
time to believe
time to believe in fairies
but theyre not real
are they
but as artemis
would soon find out
they are very real
and theyve been living
right under your feet
for 1000 years
and their cities
at the center of the earth
are not something
out of a storybook
no
they are just as real as you
diverse and strange
and beautiful
ladies and gentlemen
welcome to the wondrous
thriving metropolis
that is haven city
home of the fairies
you have now arrived
at haven city central
this transporters terminus
please make sure you take
all your belongings with you
before leaving the transporter
officer holly short
two minutes
to security briefing
do it with koboi
shuttles to the surface
we bring you
a community leader
our main story this morning
as a second week passes
there is still no sign
of the aculos
fears are rising
however authorities assure us
the crisis
will be swiftly handled
even so doubts are mounting
yeah thank you

mainly because im in it
keep an eye out brothers
we dwarves gotta watch
each others backs

ill get us out of here
youre not a dwarf

for this time mulch
tunneling and entering
put in a good word for me

you know im an artist
yeah a con artist
art is art great artists
are never understood
hey you and i would make
a great team you know
me cracking safes
tunneling into banks
you watching my back
with your tiny
but effective fairy weapons
thats your plan
less of a plan
more of a lifestyle choice
by the way this your wallet
stop picking my pockets
think of my children holly
you dont have children
not yet
prisoner for processing
hey hey hey
hey dont go yet
were the same you know
your last name is short
my whole body is short

i keep telling you that
thats just discriminatory
ill write it off as ignorance
because i love you
and thanks for the music
move it now
i am very much a dwarf
over here
briar cudgeon
is this about my appeal
yes you will be
a commander again
all charges dropped
ive convinced the executors
to grant a pardon
after your courtmartial
commander root
was powerless to stop it
who are you
my fairy godmother
yes only now you work for me
the fowl boy is in play
and i want nothing
that prevents him
from bringing me the aculos
you will infiltrate
fairy command on my behalf
i spy
you spy or you die
morning shorty
leprecon
commander what are all
these rumors about the aculos
knock it off
youve seen the news
the aculos is still missing
kelp verbil b squad c squad
youre all
on triple night duty downtown
the delicate balance of peace
in our world
now hangs by a narrow thread
until the aculos
is safely returned
our entire civilization
is at risk
from the humans
or from enemies
amongst our own kind
there is a dark force at work
and it will stop at nothing
until it has the aculos
so keep your eyes peeled
see it and report it
we must recover the aculos
and protect our anonymity
for the peace to remain
so must our secret existence
preserve that at all costs
jeopardize it
and ill have you incarcerated
at howlers peak
any questions
no good
get to work
commander root
yes what is it
commander i have
a new lead on my father
he was at the hill of tara
youre not going
but commander
thats an order
not a request
yes commander
a word of advice
youre 84 youre young
you have your whole life
ahead of you
youll have plenty of missions
to fly holly
and you can be a good officer
just dont make this personal
let them take care
of the aculos
with artemis sr gone
lets go with backup
domovoi knew
the stakes couldnt be higher
he knew he would need to
bring in some reinforcements
someone he could trust
to watch his back
to help protect fowl manor
there was only one person
he knew
who fully understood
tactical reconnaissance
brazilian jiujitsu
and the complicated mind
of a 12yearold
another 12yearold
his niece juliet butler
no links found
artemis
the searchings important
but you cant forget the basics
eat
theres no time
youve done 12 hours straight
it appears to be nowhere
in this house
and yet it has to be
zero matches
youre not giving up are you
of course not
but i think
i may know the problem
im not the one to find it
so how do we summon
this mysterious finder
of aculoses
the fairies
of course theyll help us
will they
with a bit of persuasion
and do you know where they are
in my fathers journal
he wrote of a fairy
who would periodically visit
the oak tree
on the hill of tara
shes our best option
because their world
its too well hidden
and their books
its not
just a different language
its encoded
of course its encoded
by this guy foaly
fairy tech genius and centaur
foaly
do not ask him for a ride
hello holly
i learned that the hard way
commander
what is it foaly
we have a problem
one of ours is unaccounted for
on the surface
elf dwarf goblin
hard to tell but its big
could be a deeptunnel breakout
perhaps through a fault
or dormant volcano
send someone up to identify it
all active duty officers
are downtown
searching for the aculos
officer short
yes commander
im sending you up there
yes commander
identify report
but do not engage
yes commander
clear
crystal
go go
thank you commander
commander
two minutes until lava launch
authorized personnel only
on the launch site
this is the quickest way
we can take you to the surface
so pay attention
youll be sitting on 200000
tons of molten lava
and traveling at over
600 miles an hour
so dont get out
until i give the allclear
otherwise its
goodbye holly
rest in pieces
no need to sound
so excited about it
what can i say
i just love science
um foaly
boy
lava launch
in 30 seconds and counting
stay shielded
once youre up there
total invisibility
yes commander
magma flare in 12 11
the last thing we need
is a fairy sighting
on top of everything else
hello commander
this is not the time
we have an unidentified runner
on the surface
hold on
to your breakfast holly
this is gonna be a bumpy ride
is this the best we can do
send in the daughter of
beechwood short the traitor
youre not fit to say his name
beechwood short used his magic
to steal the aculos from us
which need i remind you
is the most precious artifact
in our civilization
the aculos was stolen
on your watch
he has put our entire people
in danger and disappeared
in my book thats a traitor
get out cudgeon
before i throw you out
the executors
are watching you root
and i am their eyes and ears
and i see everything
carry on
ejecting you now
come on yes
artemis im in position
domovoi anything to report
from the hill of tara
yes im freezing
understood
now the oak trees
where dad saw that fairy
and for my plan to work
we need her
and what exactly is your plan
keep watching
trust me
copy that
head east
towards martina franca
officer short
your orders are to
contain that thing
until memory wipe arrives
is that understood
yes commander
approaching martina franca
runner located
its a fullsized troll
pick on someone your own size
i want a time freeze
around that thing
before anyone gets eaten
are you sure commander
well need authorization
from the executors
ill take
full responsibility go
time freeze capsule released
do not use magic on that human
do you read me
shes hurt
come on
come on
go now
time freeze loading
set focus
for interior paralysis only
leave these people alone
fire
retrieval
get that thing
back where it belongs
and mindwipe all those humans
who think theyve seen a fairy
or a troll
lep begin withdrawal
good work officer short
now get yourself home
immediately
yes commander
thats an order
mind wipe complete
prepare to release time freeze
um commander root
it looks like holly may be
taking a slight detour
officer short
where are you going
to clear my fathers name
ill have her badge for this
thats a bit harsh isnt it
shut up foaly
or ill have yours too
these are dangerous times
ive lost a friend
and soon
artemis will begin to know
the rumors about me
and the thefts
is he ready for the truth
that a darkness threatens
both the human
and the fairy worlds
when beechwood came to me
i knew there was no choice
the aculos was being targeted
in the wrong hands
it would mean access
to the greatest spells
in fairy lore
one could teleport armies
wipe out life
the wrong hands
are now very close
they belong
to a brilliant fairy
perhaps the greatest
of them all
but gone to the bad
name opal koboi
you are now approaching
the sacred hill of tara
coordinates 18387
officer short
return immediate
communication disabled
wow
dom the fairies
theyre real
everything my father said
was true
reload quick quick
fire
we got one
holly short
just dropped off the grid
ive lost sound and visual
i warned her not to disobey me
we cant rule out
an interception
give me her last coordinates
she just arrived on
the hill of tara in ireland
i checked the maps
the only human habitation
anywhere near it is
fowl manor
you know it
alert all personnel
im launching
a fullscale recovery
all personnel commander
land sea and air
theres a fairy unaccounted
for in the real world
if the humans see it
well lose everything
dear me root
are you losing your touch
errant trolls
abducted fairies
whatever next
if the executors find out
about this
youll be finished
get the fourleaf clover
out of here
not happy
and what if
you look one in the eye
dont
theyre trained
in arts like telekinesis
hypnosis and mesmerism
correct
so
defensive options
humans should wear
reflective glasses
in order to escape mind control
good
what is unique about dwarves
besides digging
theyre master thieves
and pickpockets
and why
theyre obsessed with treasure
and cant resist
searching for it
where am i
im impressed
you speak english
speak english
of course i speak english
i thought you might be hungry
look i dont know
what fairies eat
but i thought maybe salad
yeah whatever
i bet you have beautiful eyes
i wish i could see them
thats not going to work
weve got protection
who are you
what do you want from me
youre part of the plan
whos in charge here
i am
youre just a child
welcome to fowl manor
officer short
how do you know my name
its on your helmet
but its in gnomish
correct
ive read all about you
youve what
im here to officially
invite you into my home
invite me you just shot me
you must now do
whatever i demand
youll have to
keep me here forever
if thats what you want
youll never get away with this
my people will come for me
thats what i hoped youd say
this isnt over
you expect us to believe
he did something this dangerous
he captured a living fairy
what do you think
try to imagine
if humans suddenly found out
there was a world
of magical creatures
living beneath them
most human beings
are afraid of gluten
how do you think
theyd handle goblins
artemis wanted the aculos
to save his fathers life
and at last his master plan
was starting to fall into place
he had his first piece
bait
but now
a storm was coming his way
and the fate
of both of our worlds
was in the hands
of young artemis fowl
artemis dom
its like
the whole world is ending
the fairies are doing it
theyre creating a time freeze
i beg your pardon
its a kind of temporal vacuum
that they create
so they can operate
unseen by the human eye
i read about it
in dads journal
its formidable
einstein and hawking were right
time is bending all over
anything could happen now
anythings possible
and while it holds
the perfect conditions
for an attack
exactly
we just picked up
your friends arriving
cant wait to meet them
you wont even see them
whatever youre planning
will fail
fairies do not negotiate
you cant win
well see about that
sweet
incredible
en garde
you are so dead
the pair of you
foaly
i need that time freeze now
exterior only
i need the inside to be alive
i have to talk to that kid
receiver dishes
in position check
time freeze successful
top of the mornin
theyre coming for her
artemis do you really think
this is going to work
who knows
im going to need the suit
send in the advance team
yes commander
capture only
we need the humans unharmed
we scare them
we do not kill them
i want them alive
scared artemis
a little bit
but i prefer scared to dead
if possible
i agree
if possible
what are they doing
unarmed
against all of us
take the shot
stop them
they have officer shorts
weapon
behind you dom
no
shoot the time freeze capsule
take the shot
hes
destabilized the time freeze
how long do we have
i can try to patch it
but its not going to hold
this is serious
whatever youre going to do
you need to do it fast
send in someone to negotiate
you have five minutes
no
well it appears
your clever little son
has kidnapped a fairy
he has your flair
for the dramatic
why are you doing this
why
its very simple
revenge
not only did your people
wage war on mine
considered yourself superior
in every way
mocked us reviled us
dismissed us
as the little people
but as soon as we were gone
you reduced us further
to silly stories
to have people laugh at us
or to frighten the children
you cant win
you underestimate your people
and mine
fairies and humans
are incapable of friendship
incapable of coexistence
with the aculos
i will rise to the surface
then release my army
to take over the earth
and own both worlds
and systematically wipe out
all of mankind
then i will restore fairies
to their rightful place
as humanity crumbles beneath us
some said i was mad
they wouldnt listen to me
guess what
theyre listening now
my name is commander root
i invite you into my house
nice try
im here to negotiate
whos in charge here
i am
youre only ten years old
twelve how old are you
if you must know
im going to be 803 in may
whats your name
artemis fowl
so that explains it
you fowls have been giving us
trouble for centuries
wheres your thieving father
these days
i wouldnt worry about that
now listen carefully
artemis fowl
unless you release
officer short immediately
ill destroy this house
and everyone in it
and i will expose
your existence to the world
you cant
youre in a time freeze
you cant get out
but only for another 27 minutes
commander here are my terms
bring me the aculos
and officer short goes free
i beg your pardon
you heard me the aculos
in one of those pots
from under a rainbow i presume
i warn you
we do not pay ransoms
we never have
and we never will
you might just want
to reconsider that
ill give you 15 minutes
and in case youre thinking
of storming the house
no fairies are allowed
to enter it while im alive
as you say
while youre alive
who is this child
i think he said
he was artemis fowl jr
shut up foaly
cant anyone ask a rhetorical
question around here
but hes going to find out
we dont even have the aculos
and we cant storm the house
thats fairy rules
he never said anything
about dwarves
remember what i said about
not underestimating the kid
well heres exactly why
the next piece of his plan
was set in motion
knowing the fairies
couldnt enter fowl manor
he forced their hand and set
the stage for the entrance
of the true hero of our tale
well if you ask me that is
get me mulch diggums
the kids plan
was fiendishly clever
he just had to get me
in the house
because he knew the truth
about dwarves
we cant resist treasure
which is what brought me back
to this cozy little jail cell
see this was my third time
in howlers peak
the worst prison in haven city
my first time in
i did 164 years
but this time
i came with music
courtesy of officer holly short
1984 foreigner
its a real classic
you know
if you like human music
you seem like
more of a glam kind of guy
what are you looking at dwarf
your eyes
just wondering
what thoughts lie behind
those two impenetrable windows
so you like eating dirt
well i dont know
if like is the right term
tunneling is kinda something
i have to do
its an occupational hazard
just dont stand behind you
while youre doing it right
so this just got awkward
are you laughin at me dwarf
at you no
i was just following
their social cues
because im not laughing
yeah i can tell
wow
guards
theyre really
understaffed here
hi
do you like fire too
no not so much thats
so you know
no dwarf really likes fire
careful careful
we could all go up in flames
not us
our skin
is completely fireproof
thats right isnt it
forgot about that
your skin may be fireproof
but what about your brain
mulch diggums
commander root wants to see you
exceptional timing
goodbye gentlemen
so i just spoke to your boss
i think she got the message
how are you
expecting this to end
with me getting what i want
which is what exactly
my fathers safe return
this has nothing to do
with your father
look at you with that grin
thinking youre
outsmarting everyone
in your little suit
and sunglasses
youre enjoying all this
you think its a game
game
my father was kidnapped
my father is dead
can i trust you
youll have to
you have no choice
how did he die
it was on the hill of tara
he was ambushed
by one of our kind
because hed stolen
something called the aculos
ive read in my fathers
journals about the aculos
about a fairy
who swore to protect it
a fairy named beechwood
beechwood short was my father
he knew how dangerous
the aculos can be
it can open portals
between worlds
a skeleton key
for the whole universe
he hid it
and for that some say
that he was a criminal
thats what they say
about my dad
but you know its not true
that hurt
artemis it looks like
weve got another visitor
commander time freeze
integrity down to 60
understood
hold it together foaly
mulch
this is a onetime offer
fifty years off your sentence
if youll dig your way
into fowl manor
and bring out officer short
commander root
do you mind if i call you
i actually dont know
your first name
let me guess britney
im way off arent i
it appears to me
like youve got a big problem
on your hands
but
has anyone ever told you
youre like david bowie
if david bowie were a fairy
so essentially
youre david bowie
do you think
the humans will ever
find out he was one of us
anyway
50 years off my sentence
just isnt gonna cut it here
i know what you want
i cant give you that
come on root
please
i just
i just want to be small
i just want to be normal
like the rest of my kind
to be accepted
you fairies got magic
coming out of your ears
what have i got
three four feet i dont need
look a giant dwarf is exactly
what i need right now
what i need right now
a big fast hungry tunneler
wholl dig their way
into that house
its your choice
either bring out officer short
or get back to jail
listen to the two of us
grunting at each other
like a pair of hippos
with a throat infection
a criminal
a criminal
thats what you think i am
i am so much more
than a criminal
um technically most of what
i do is criminal activity
but im also an artist
youre picking my pocket
okay a hundred years
off my sentence
and a single cell
with no goblins
single cell and 55 years
seventyfive
sixty
seventyfour
done officers
you reading me mulch
loud and clear horsey
dwarfus giaganticus
dwarfus giaganticus
everybody
stand back
its feeding time
im in
i know that sound
mulch diggums
mulch
im switching
your iriscam to xray
thats good
you do you foaly
you might feel a slight pinch
you son of a
sorry
what would your parents be
we have a visitor
what is it
its in the portrait gallery
its like a really really
big dwarf
yes
right on schedule
well if i was
gonna be manipulated
might as well be by the best
and make no mistake
the kid is the best
house marks the spot
what have we here
the txtl 5000
hes discovered a safe
let him open it
thats exactly what i want
we meet again
so theyve sent in a dwarf
look i need your help
listen if i let you out
will you promise not to
take command of my brain
i want nothing to do
with that brain
and
bingo
temperamental
youve evolved
but so have i
sounds like youre not
the only one opening locks
by the way if you run
i will expose your existence
to the world
you are my guest
i invited you in
the rules are clear
they are but you think
you can trust me
now you can trust me
fair enough
lets find that dwarf
eight new
motionsensitive tumblers
you devil
it cant be
holy moly
step back mr diggums
its real
its perfect
the aculos
the most powerful treasure
in the fairy world
dont
it will kill you if you use it
if any human does
i dont need to use it
because my bargaining position
just got a whole lot stronger
the fairies outside mustnt
get to hear that we have this
im sorry human
but they already know
theres been a development
they found the aculos
as i expected
in fowl manor
you know what to do
its risky
root has our entire army
at her disposal
its quite simple cudgeon
if you wish to survive
and thrive
in my brave new world
then you will intervene now
commander
this time freeze
is seriously unstable
this may not hold
weve lost one
commander root
you are hereby officially
relieved of your command
on authorization
of the executors
youre making a mistake
cudgeon
my only mistake was not
doing this a long time ago
with the aculos in play
the game has changed
time for a little direct action
dont you think
let me show you how its done
knock it off
mistake
i mean really big mistake
this should wrap things up
recognize our new recruit
we fed it a little potion
of nettles and wasp juice
everything trolls
are allergic to
its made it twice as strong
and 10 times as mad
darvit

i dont understand

no human can access
its their source of magic
as important to them
as the sun is to us
you have to try
i thought i could but i cant
holly said if any human
uses it theyll die
were running out of time
artemis its too dangerous
exactly
its useless in my hands
but not in mine
youre late
you know im breaking
every rule in the book
you like to break rules
you can talk
lets make a trade
the aculos for my father
how do i know i can trust you
my father used to say
a friends eye
is a good mirror
are we friends
artemis fowl
we are
forever friends
we need to hurry
your time is up
the young genius artemis fowl
has failed his beloved father
say hello to beechwood for me
i dont even know
that this will work
you have to try
carry me always
carry me well
i am thy teacher
of herb and spell
i am thy link to power arcane
forget me
and thy magic shall wane
die fowl
to power arcane
forget me
and thy magic shall wane
carry me well carry me well
forget me magic shall wane
carry me well
did it work
did you bring him back
i dont know
he cant be please
dad
dad
artemis
im so sorry
its over
ive lost him havent i
artemis
did you hear that
dad dad
dad
dad
dad
artemis
no
how
how did you save me son
i just followed the story
with a little help
from a friend
dad
meet officer holly short
daughter of beechwood short
your father was a great man
and a dear friend
he brought me the aculos
because there are forces
in your world
who wanted its power
for themselves
so he was trying to protect it
yes
yes yes he was
and he did
with his life
your father was a hero holly
just like you
he gave me this list
its a list of names
that i cant even pronounce
these are opals accomplices
we were looking for them
when i was captured
theyre the ones
youll want to investigate
im sorry for your loss
thank you very much
its so good to see you
i am not going to cry
im not going to cry
the aculos is safe at last
now that we know our enemies
thanks to you holly
quite the day
yes commander
curb that maverick streak in you
and youll make
a decent officer someday
thank you commander
this place needs
fairies like you
our world has never been
so much in danger
its not perfect holly
but its ours
its a light to guide us
and its worth fighting for
i want you to investigate
every name
on your fathers list
me
well who else am i talking to
nobody else commander just me
go on
im going to
you wont regret
i will not
go on
ill just go
here we go dad
nice work holly
well done holly
all right team
here we go
this is a community
still coming to terms
with these stunning revelations
the family has lived
in the house
for generations
and is wellknown locally
but theres a sense of real
shock here that artemis fowl
who neighbors describe
as quiet and
it would appear weve garnered
quite a bit of interest
not ideal
the media
i have someone
working on that right now
i expected you would
these are for you son
just dont forget to wash it
before you bring it back okay
where are we going
to finish this
you think im ready
i know youre ready
first i have a call to make
you failed opal
you were wrong about my father
about beechwood
about everything
and now
were coming for you
you think you can beat me
you have no idea the world
that you have just entered boy
just who do you think you are
im artemis fowl
and im a criminal mastermind
what an extraordinary ending
to your remarkable fairy tale
but lets get back
to the thief shall we
he will be brought to justice
and you will not leave here
until you assist us
you really dont believe
any of it
the only thing
in that fanciful tale
i did believe
is that you can be bought
so let us offer you a deal
help us apprehend
artemis fowl sr
and then youll walk
tsk
or perhaps i offer you a deal
i walk out on my own
and you leave
the fowls alone forever
and why would we ever do that
so that you can
all sleep at night
knowing that the fairy tales
you tell your kids
remain beautiful dreams
and not living nightmares
and the next time
you see the fowls
be sure to thank them
for protecting us all
they keep the peace
dont ever forget it
thats why artemis
set up my arrest
thats why im here
he figured
youd have to believe me
alert the guards
i hope you dont get squeamish
lockdown
immediate lockdown
a tracking device
designed by the kid
clap your hands
if you believe in fairies
thats my ride
lockdown
get back here
you filthy little dwarf
dwarfus giaganticus
dont mind me i got this
are you ready
to get back to work
i thought youd never ask
