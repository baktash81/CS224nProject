most daring
thefts of modern times 
fowl is said
to be hiding ancient relics
worth hundreds of millions of   
time and again 
these museums
were robbed of untold riches 
some say the true amount stolen
may never be known 
where i am amidst
what can only be described
as a media frenzy 
he couldn t dismiss the fact
that when he was arrested   
the collection contains
the rarest evidence
of ancient worlds 
most expressed horror at his
alleged criminal activity 
while others hinted at a more
widespread conspiracy 
many similarities
to numerous daring thefts
shrouded in mystery 
a crowd has gathered   
it s him  it s him 
breaking news 
there is the car 
yes  the car has come down 
and it looks like
young artemis fowl is here 
authorities
have now made connections
to one man 
artemis fowl 
breaking news now
and a suspected accomplice
of artemis fowl
is today arrested
near fowl manor 
help me 
is this
unidentified individual a link
to artemis fowl
and the multiple thefts 
we have reports
that british intelligence
authorities
are expected to question
the subject immediately 
is it true 
do you have anything to say 
artemis 
how does it feel
to have a criminal
for a father  artemis 
your name 
mulch diggums 
exactly what were you doing
near fowl manor 
so now it s illegal
to go for a hike 
this was no hike 
unless you tell us exactly
what happened at fowl manor 
you will be
permanently imprisoned 
wait  wait  wait 
you don t want me 
no  no  i m just
a talented tunneler 
you want the brains
of the operation 
the one who stole the aculos 
what  precisely  is the aculos 
the aculos 
a weapon
so powerful and mysterious 
it can barely be imagined 
you re lying 
look  i know
you don t believe my story 
but i can prove it 
mr  diggums 
i highly doubt that 
you will see 
all i see is
that there was some highly
unusual seismic activity
around fowl manor
and reports from a crazed
fisherman of fairies 
well  maybe the fisherman saw
something he wasn t meant to 
it s fantasy 
what s reality is that
you are a common thief
who is somehow in league
with a quite uncommon thief 
we want to know everything
about the man you work for 
the man 
no 
this isn t about the father 
this is about the son 
the son 
do not underestimate the kid 
let me show you
the infinite possibilities
of magic 
let me tell you
the story of artemis fowl 
a story that begins where
every great story begins 
in a place where magic
and wonder still exist 
the most magical place on earth 
ireland 
home of artemis fowl 
artemis loved ireland 
the sea and the land 
not so much the school 
you see  he just didn t need it 
when he was seven 
he beat european
chess champion evan rashoggi
in five moves 
when he was nine  he won
the architectural competition
to design
the dublin opera house 
when he was ten 
he cloned a goat
and named it bruce 
weird choice 
but he s an unusual kid 
good 
and you know
when you re that unusual 
you re going to stick out 
well  artemis 
let s talk  shall we 
certainly  sir 
i can see
you re admiring my chair 
it s a family heirloom 
grandfather acquired it
from sotheby s 
william and mary period 
1689 to 1702 
as i m sure you know 
impressive 
once in use at the palace 
buckingham palace 
queen s favorite chair 
apparently 
now  artemis 
there is a problem 
the problem is that
i know the textbook reply
to any question
you may choose to ask 
the problem is that you don t
respect anyone enough
to treat them as an equal 
that s ridiculous 
i hold several people
in the very highest esteem 
really  who  for example 
albert einstein 
his theories
were usually correct 
how about someone
you actually know 
you seem to have
all the answers  doctor 
why don t you tell me 
well 
where shall we start 
that s my biography  i presume 
it is 
it explains quite a lot 
such as 
well  firstly 
there s your dear mother 
of course 
who was a wonderful woman 
in my opinion 
and taken from us far too soon 
but who sadly had absolutely
no control over your behavior 
then  of course 
there s your father
and his mysterious absences
from home 
this is a sensitive area 
doctor 
but do you think
that s why you are as you are 
no 
and by the way  i didn t know
they allowed fakes
at the palace 
  fake 
  it s clever 
i ll give you that 
but look at these
furniture tacks 
crisscross pattern on the head 
machine tooled 
makes it 1890s at the earliest 
your grandfather was duped 
artemis 
you re lashing out at me 
but i think i know
what this is really about 
is it because of the burden
of your father s name 
no 
it s because
i m forced to endure
this ridiculous therapy 
artemis 
look  just who do you think
you are 
but  of course 
artemis wasn t on his own 
even if it may have seemed
that way sometimes 
for if there was one thing
artemis liked
more than his own company 
it was being at home
with his dad 
artemis fowl  sr  
a dealer
of antiques and rarities
and just about
every irish fairy tale
you might care to imagine 
they re trained in the art of   
except that
you didn t have to imagine 
for artemis sr 
taught artemis jr 
everything there was to know
about the leprechauns
and the banshees
and the sprites and the goblins 
so much so that you might
even have thought
that artemis sr  believed
in the legends
of the little people 
he certainly shared
his passion with his son
on the rare occasions
when he wasn t away from home 
but while he was there 
he was absolutely determined
to have artemis know
all that could be known
about the fairies 
to prepare the boy for a day
that would come much sooner
than anyone expected 
did i ever tell you
how all those fairy stones
got to come to fowl manor 
thousands of years ago 
this is where
the peace was made 
after the war
between the human world
and the tuatha de danaan 
a human and a fairy met   
just tell me
when you re leaving 
the helicopter s
being prepared
for me right now  son 
i m sorry 
i ll be back as soon as i can 
that s what you said
the last time 
and the time before 
i know  arty 
there s just one very
important thing i have to do 
and i know it s been hard 
but  look 
my work is coming to an end 
and like the stories  you know 
they all have an ending
that just   
well  it makes you smile 
and this one
will be no different 
and when it ends 
a new story will begin 
and maybe 
just maybe 
it ll be yours 
i m not a kid anymore  dad 
well  you used to
believe in magic 
you believed in the goblins 
and you believed in the trolls 
you believed in everything
i told you
about the hill of tara 
all i really want
is to believe in you 
okay 
come here  son 
i love you  son 
more than you could ever know 
then take me with you 
you re all i have now  arty 
let me keep you safe
for a little longer 
come on 
and remember 
until i see you again 
may the road rise up
to meet you 
may the wind
be always at your back 
may the sun shine
warm upon your face 
may the rain fall soft
upon your fields 
and until we meet again 
may a friend be always near 
good night  son 
good night  dad 
what are you talking about 
yes  he took off yesterday 
as planned 
what do you mean 
he never arrived 
the boat was empty 
have you checked the manifest 
how long
before the media have it 
i don t know  you d better
make some inquiries 
domovoi butler 
friend  mentor  bodyguard 
ten years of martial arts
training in kyoto 
seven years of
weapons training in moscow 
six years of strength training
at gold s gym in venice 
california 
and under no circumstances
were you to ever call him
 the butler 
even though his last name
was in fact  butler  
you could call him  dom  
or  domovoi  
or  very large man in a suit  
but call him  the butler  
and he d snap you in half 
not always sunny  though 
there will be some cloud
that ll bring a few drizzles
now and again 
especially along the western
and northern coast 
now back to our main story 
authorities today launched
a worldwide manhunt
for artemis fowl 
a reclusive businessman 
but now
a controversial public figure
whose superyacht  the owl star 
was found abandoned last night
in the south china seas 
fowl is a known collector
and antiquities dealer 
but in dramatic new revelations 
he is also suspected
to have been behind
some of the biggest robberies
of the past 10 years 
including the disappearance
of the priceless rosetta stone
from the british museum 
the irreplaceable 14th century
boru s harp 
and the iconic book of kells
from trinity college  dublin 
no sign of struggle was found
aboard the owl star
and her owner s fate
is entirely unknown 
investigations are ongoing 
but until further news
of his whereabouts
can be established 
doubts will remain 
my dad 
  artemis 
  where is he  dom 
we don t know 
i have people on the way
to the wreck as we speak 
and the remaining question   
artemis fowl 
antiquities dealer
or criminal mastermind 
how dare they 
he s not a criminal 
he s my dad 
he s my dad 
dad 
artemis  don t answer the phone 
  artemis 
  dad 
hello  dad 
hello 
artemis jr   i presume 
i have your father 
what  who is this 
is this a hoax 
if you have my father 
i want proof 
then you shall have some 
dad  dad 
artemis 
artemis 
you listen to me  son 
you stay out of this 
okay  do you hear me 
there s no way you can help me 
it s too big 
everything i ve told you
is true  it s all true 
your father stole something
from me and hid it 
my enemies have prevented me
from retrieving it myself 
you will do so on my behalf 
find the aculos  or you will
never see him again 
artemis 
what s the aculos 
you re a clever boy 
you ll work it out 
you have three days 
artemis  what did they say 
word for word 
whoever it was   
  man  woman 
  i couldn t tell 
but they were asking for
something called the aculos 
what is it 
artemis  get dressed
and come with me 
you weren t supposed
to see this yet 
your father would kill me
if he knew we were here 
i m showing you
because i have no choice 
what is all this 
this is where your father
kept his entire life s work 
and his father 
and his father before him 
it s not what it looks like 
artemis 
everything in this room
was acquired
for a specific reason 
sometimes to protect
its secrets 
sometimes to keep it from
falling into the wrong hands 
these are relics
from another world 
i don t understand 
i was never meant to share
the details
of your family business 
these relics
have been passed down
through the generations 
they re secrets that your father
had intended to share with you
when the time was right 
but the fairies are a myth 
none of this is actually true 
look around you  arty 
maybe those stories
can help us find him 
but where to begin 
i don t see anything
about an aculos  do you 
no 
i helped him catalogue
much of this 
but he never mentioned
such a thing 
and he always shared
his discoveries with me 
the only thing he kept private
was his journal 
then that s what
we have to find 
i wouldn t know
where to begin to look 
could your father
have ever given you a clue
as to where to start 
he never told me how to start 
but he may have told me
how to end 
  end 
  yeah 
he read the same poem to me
every night before bed
and every time he left 
 may the road rise up
to meet you 
 may the wind
be always at your back 
 may the sun shine
warm upon your face  
 may the rains fall soft
upon your fields  
who wrote this poem  arty 
nobody knows 
that s just it 
then how do you find it 
it s known
as  the irish blessing  
it s a journal 
it s dad s journal 
go to the last entry 
 she s hunting me now
and would kill me to find it 
 she knows the truth of
 what beechwood gave me
before he died 
 they know
we have the aculos  
the voice on the phone
told you to find it 
 the aculos cannot fall
into the wrong hands 
 it had to be protected 
 even from
the fairies themselves 
 time to believe  
time to believe in fairies 
but they re not real 
are they 
but as artemis
would soon find out 
they are very real
and they ve been living
right under your feet
for 1 000 years 
and their cities
at the center of the earth
are not something
out of a storybook 
no 
they are just as real as you 
diverse and strange
and beautiful 
ladies and gentlemen 
welcome to the wondrous 
thriving metropolis
that is haven city 
home of the fairies 
you have now arrived
at haven city central 
this transporter s terminus 
please make sure you take
all your belongings with you
before leaving the transporter 
officer holly short 
two minutes
to security briefing 
do it with koboi 
shuttles to the surface   
we bring you
a community leader   
our main story this morning 
as a second week passes 
there is still no sign
of the aculos 
fears are rising 
however  authorities assure us
the crisis
will be swiftly handled 
even so  doubts are mounting 
yeah  thank you 
see  this is my favorite part 
mainly because i m in it 
keep an eye out  brothers 
we dwarves gotta watch
each other s backs 
am i right 
lay low 
i ll get us out of here 
you re not a dwarf 
  no  i am  i m a dwarf 
  no  you re not 
i am a giant dwarf 
you ve got a big mouth
for a dwarf 
you won t talk so much
at howler s peak 
that s where we goblins
do the talking 
and what we say goes 
next 
hi there  gents 
mulch diggums 
two g s in diggums 
tunneling and entering 
repeat offender  400 years 
yeah  that sounds about right 
hey  hey  hey

next  move 
officer short 
good to see you 
what are you in
for this time  mulch 
tunneling and entering 
put in a good word for me 
will you 
you know i m an artist 
yeah  a con artist 
art is art  great artists
are never understood 
hey  you and i would make
a great team  you know 
me cracking safes 
tunneling into banks 
you watching my back
with your tiny
but effective fairy weapons 
that s your plan 
less of a plan 
more of a lifestyle choice 
by the way  this your wallet 
stop picking my pockets 
think of my children  holly 
  you don t have children 
  not yet 
prisoner for processing 
hey  hey  hey 
hey  don t go yet 
we re the same  you know 
your last name is short 
my whole body is short 
you re not short 
i keep telling you that 
that s just discriminatory 
i ll write it off as ignorance
because i love you 
and thanks for the music 
move it now 
i am very much a dwarf 
over here 
briar cudgeon 
is this about my appeal 
yes  you will be
a commander again 
all charges dropped 
i ve convinced the executors
to grant a pardon
after your court martial 
commander root
was powerless to stop it 
who are you 
my fairy godmother 
yes  only now you work for me 
the fowl boy is in play 
and i want nothing
that prevents him
from bringing me the aculos 
you will infiltrate
fairy command on my behalf 
i spy 
you spy or you die 
morning  shorty 
leprecon 
commander  what are all
these rumors about the aculos 
knock it off 
you ve seen the news 
the aculos is still missing 
kelp  verbil  b squad  c squad 
you re all
on triple night duty downtown 
the delicate balance of peace
in our world
now hangs by a narrow thread 
until the aculos
is safely returned 
our entire civilization
is at risk
from the humans
or from enemies
amongst our own kind 
there is a dark force at work 
and it will stop at nothing
until it has the aculos 
so keep your eyes peeled 
see it and report it 
we must recover the aculos
and protect our anonymity 
for the peace to remain 
so must our secret existence 
preserve that at all costs 
jeopardize it 
and i ll have you incarcerated
at howler s peak 
any questions 
no  good 
get to work 
commander root 
yes  what is it 
commander  i have
a new lead on my father 
he was at the hill of tara 
  you re not going 
  but  commander   
that s an order 
not a request 
yes  commander 
a word of advice 
you re 84  you re young 
you have your whole life
ahead of you 
you ll have plenty of missions
to fly  holly 
and you can be a good officer 
just don t make this personal 
let them take care
of the aculos 
with artemis sr  gone   
let s go with backup 
domovoi knew
the stakes couldn t be higher 
he knew he would need to
bring in some reinforcements 
someone he could trust
to watch his back
to help protect fowl manor 
there was only one person
he knew
who fully understood
tactical reconnaissance 
brazilian jiu jitsu 
and the complicated mind
of a 12 year old 
another 12 year old 
his niece  juliet butler 
no links found 
artemis 
the searching s important 
but you can t forget the basics 
  eat 
  there s no time 
you ve done 12 hours straight 
it appears to be nowhere
in this house
  and yet it has to be 
  zero matches 
you re not giving up  are you 
of course not 
but i think
i may know the problem 
i m not the one to find it 
so  how do we summon
this mysterious finder
of aculoses 
the fairies 
of course  they ll help us 
will they 
with a bit of persuasion 
and do you know where they are 
in my father s journal 
he wrote of a fairy
who would periodically visit
the oak tree
on the hill of tara 
she s our best option 
because their world 
it s too well hidden 
and their books 
it s not
just a different language 
it s encoded 
of course it s encoded 
by this guy  foaly 
fairy tech genius and centaur 
foaly 
do not ask him for a ride 
hello  holly 
i learned that the hard way 
commander 
what is it  foaly 
we have a problem 
one of ours is unaccounted for
on the surface 
elf  dwarf  goblin 
hard to tell  but it s big 
could be a deep tunnel breakout 
perhaps through a fault
or dormant volcano 
send someone up to identify it 
all active duty officers
are downtown
searching for the aculos 
  officer short 
  yes  commander 
  i m sending you up there 
  yes  commander 
identify  report 
  but do not engage 
  yes  commander 
  clear 
  crystal 
  go  go 
  thank you  commander 
commander 
two minutes until lava launch 
authorized personnel only
on the launch site 
this is the quickest way
we can take you to the surface
so pay attention 
you ll be sitting on 200 000
tons of molten lava
and traveling at over
600 miles an hour 
so don t get out
until i give the all clear 
otherwise  it s   
goodbye  holly 
rest in pieces 
no need to sound
so excited about it 
what can i say 
i just love science 
um  foaly 
boy 
lava launch
in 30 seconds and counting 
stay shielded
once you re up there 
  total invisibility 
  yes  commander 
magma flare in 12  11   
the last thing we need
is a fairy sighting
on top of everything else 
hello  commander 
this is not the time 
we have an unidentified runner
on the surface 
hold on
to your breakfast  holly 
this is gonna be a bumpy ride 
is this the best we can do 
send in the daughter of
beechwood short  the traitor 
you re not fit to say his name 
beechwood short used his magic
to steal the aculos from us 
which  need i remind you 
is the most precious artifact
in our civilization 
the aculos was stolen
on your watch 
he has put our entire people
in danger and disappeared 
in my book  that s a traitor 
get out  cudgeon 
before i throw you out 
the executors
are watching you  root 
and i am their eyes and ears 
and i see everything 
carry on 
ejecting you now 
come on  yes 
artemis  i m in position 
domovoi  anything to report
from the hill of tara 
  yes  i m freezing 
  understood 
now  the oak tree s
where dad saw that fairy 
and for my plan to work 
we need her 
and what exactly is your plan 
keep watching 
trust me 
copy that 
head east
towards martina franca 
officer short 
your orders are to
contain that thing
until memory wipe arrives 
is that understood 
yes  commander 
approaching martina franca 
runner located 
it s a full sized troll 
pick on someone your own size 
i want a time freeze
around that thing
before anyone gets eaten 
are you sure  commander 
we ll need authorization
from the executors 
i ll take
full responsibility  go 
time freeze capsule released 
do not use magic on that human 
do you read me 
she s hurt 
come on 
come on 
go  now 
time freeze loading 
set focus
for interior paralysis only 
leave these people alone 
fire 
retrieval 
get that thing
back where it belongs
and mind wipe all those humans
who think they ve seen a fairy
or a troll 
l e p   begin withdrawal 
good work  officer short 
now get yourself home
immediately 
yes  commander 
that s an order 
mind wipe complete 
prepare to release time freeze 
um  commander root 
it looks like holly may be
taking a slight detour 
officer short 
where are you going 
to clear my father s name 
i ll have her badge for this 
that s a bit harsh  isn t it 
shut up  foaly 
or i ll have yours  too 
these are dangerous times 
i ve lost a friend
and soon 
artemis will begin to know
the rumors about me
and the thefts 
is he ready for the truth 
that a darkness threatens
both the human
and the fairy worlds 
when beechwood came to me 
i knew there was no choice 
the aculos was being targeted 
in the wrong hands 
it would mean access
to the greatest spells
in fairy lore 
one could teleport armies 
wipe out life 
the wrong hands
are now very close 
they belong
to a brilliant fairy 
perhaps the greatest
of them all 
but gone to the bad 
name  opal koboi 
you are now approaching
the sacred hill of tara 
coordinates 1 8 3 8 7 
officer short 
return immediate   
communication disabled 
wow 
dom  the fairies 
they re real 
everything my father said
was true 
reload  quick  quick 
fire 
we got one 
holly short
just dropped off the grid 
i ve lost sound and visual 
i warned her not to disobey me 
we can t rule out
an interception 
give me her last coordinates 
she just arrived on
the hill of tara in ireland 
i checked the maps 
the only human habitation
anywhere near it is   
fowl manor 
you know it 
alert all personnel 
i m launching
a full scale recovery 
  all personnel  commander 
  land  sea  and air 
there s a fairy unaccounted
for in the real world 
if the humans see it 
we ll lose everything 
dear me  root 
are you losing your touch 
errant trolls 
abducted fairies 
whatever next 
if the executors find out
about this 
you ll be finished 
get the four leaf clover
out of here 
not happy 
and what if
you look one in the eye 
don t 
they re trained
in arts like telekinesis 
hypnosis  and mesmerism 
correct 
so 
defensive options 
humans should wear
reflective glasses
in order to escape mind control 
good 
what is unique about dwarves 
besides digging 
they re master thieves
and pickpockets 
and why 
they re obsessed with treasure
and can t resist
searching for it 
where am i 
i m impressed 
you speak english 
speak english 
of course i speak english 
i thought you might be hungry 
look  i don t know
what fairies eat 
but i thought maybe salad 
yeah  whatever 
i bet you have beautiful eyes 
i wish i could see them 
that s not going to work 
we ve got protection 
who are you 
what do you want from me 
you re part of the plan 
  who s in charge here 
  i am 
you re just a child 
welcome to fowl manor 
officer short 
  how do you know my name 
  it s on your helmet 
but it s in gnomish 
correct 
i ve read all about you 
you ve what 
i m here to officially
invite you into my home 
invite me  you just shot me 
you must now do
whatever i demand 
you ll have to
keep me here forever 
if that s what you want 
you ll never get away with this 
my people will come for me 
that s what i hoped you d say 
this isn t over 
you expect us to believe
he did something this dangerous 
he captured a living fairy 
what do you think 
try to imagine
if humans suddenly found out
there was a world
of magical creatures
living beneath them 
most human beings
are afraid of gluten 
how do you think
they d handle goblins 
artemis wanted the aculos
to save his father s life 
and at last  his master plan
was starting to fall into place 
he had his first piece 
bait 
but now 
a storm was coming his way 
and the fate
of both of our worlds
was in the hands
of young artemis fowl 
artemis  dom 
it s like
the whole world is ending 
the fairies are doing it 
they re creating a time freeze 
i beg your pardon 
it s a kind of temporal vacuum
that they create
so they can operate
unseen by the human eye 
i read about it
in dad s journal 
it s formidable 
einstein and hawking were right 
time is bending all over 
anything could happen now 
anything s possible 
and while it holds 
the perfect conditions
for an attack 
exactly 
we just picked up
your friends arriving 
can t wait to meet them 
you won t even see them 
whatever you re planning
will fail 
fairies do not negotiate 
you can t win 
we ll see about that 
sweet 
incredible 
en garde 
you are so dead 
the pair of you 
foaly 
i need that time freeze now 
exterior only 
i need the inside to be alive 
i have to talk to that kid 
receiver dishes
in position  check 
time freeze successful 
top of the mornin  
they re coming for her 
artemis  do you really think
this is going to work 
who knows 
i m going to need the suit 
send in the advance team 
yes  commander 
capture only 
we need the humans unharmed 
we scare them 
we do not kill them 
i want them alive 
scared  artemis 
a little bit 
but i prefer scared to dead 
if possible 
i agree 
if possible 
  what are they doing 
  unarmed 
against all of us 
take the shot 
stop them 
they have officer short s
weapon 
behind you  dom 
no 
shoot the time freeze capsule 
take the shot 
he s
destabilized the time freeze 
how long do we have 
i can try to patch it 
but it s not going to hold 
this is serious 
whatever you re going to do 
you need to do it fast 
send in someone to negotiate 
you have five minutes 
no 
well  it appears
your clever little son
has kidnapped a fairy 
he has your flair
for the dramatic 
why are you doing this 
why 
it s very simple 
revenge 
not only did your people
wage war on mine 
considered yourself superior
in every way 
mocked us  reviled us 
dismissed us
as the little people 
but as soon as we were gone 
you reduced us further
to silly stories 
to have people laugh at us 
or to frighten the children 
you can t win 
you underestimate your people
and mine 
fairies and humans
are incapable of friendship 
incapable of coexistence 
with the aculos 
i will rise to the surface
then release my army
to take over the earth
and own both worlds
and systematically wipe out
all of mankind 
then  i will restore fairies
to their rightful place
as humanity crumbles beneath us 
some said i was mad 
they wouldn t listen to me 
guess what 
they re listening now 
my name is commander root 
i invite you into my house 
nice try 
i m here to negotiate 
who s in charge here 
i am 
you re only ten years old 
twelve  how old are you 
if you must know 
i m going to be 803 in may 
what s your name 
artemis fowl 
so  that explains it 
you fowls have been giving us
trouble for centuries 
where s your thieving father
these days 
i wouldn t worry about that 
now  listen carefully 
artemis fowl 
unless you release
officer short immediately 
i ll destroy this house
and everyone in it 
and i will expose
your existence to the world 
you can t 
you re in a time freeze 
you can t get out 
but only for another 27 minutes 
commander  here are my terms 
bring me the aculos 
and officer short goes free 
i beg your pardon 
you heard me  the aculos 
in one of those pots 
from under a rainbow  i presume 
i warn you 
we do not pay ransoms 
we never have 
and we never will 
you might just want
to reconsider that 
i ll give you 15 minutes 
and in case you re thinking
of storming the house 
no fairies are allowed
to enter it while i m alive 
as you say 
while you re alive 
who is this child 
i think he said
he was artemis fowl  jr 
shut up  foaly 
can t anyone ask a rhetorical
question around here 
but he s going to find out
we don t even have the aculos
and we can t storm the house 
that s fairy rules 
he never said anything
about dwarves 
remember what i said about
not underestimating the kid 
well  here s exactly why 
the next piece of his plan
was set in motion 
knowing the fairies
couldn t enter fowl manor 
he forced their hand and set
the stage for the entrance
of the true hero of our tale 
well  if you ask me  that is 
get me mulch diggums 
the kid s plan
was fiendishly clever 
he just had to get me
in the house
because he knew the truth
about dwarves 
we can t resist treasure 
which is what brought me back
to this cozy little jail cell 
see  this was my third time
in howler s peak 
the worst prison in haven city 
my first time in 
i did 164 years 
but this time 
i came with music 
courtesy of officer holly short 
1984  foreigner 
it s a real classic 
you know 
if you like human music 
you seem like
more of a glam kind of guy 
what are you looking at  dwarf 
your eyes 
just wondering
what thoughts lie behind
those two impenetrable windows 
so  you like eating dirt 
well  i don t know
if  like  is the right term 
tunneling is kinda something
i have to do 
it s an occupational hazard 
just don t stand behind you
while you re doing it  right 
so  this just got awkward 
are you laughin  at me  dwarf 
at you  no 
i was just following
their social cues 
because i m not laughing 
yeah  i can tell 
wow 
guards 
they re really
understaffed here 
hi 
do you like fire  too 
no  not so much  that s   
so you know 
no dwarf really likes fire 
careful  careful 
we could all go up in flames 
not us 
our skin
is completely fireproof 
that s right  isn t it 
forgot about that 
your skin may be fireproof 
but what about your brain 
mulch diggums 
commander root wants to see you 
exceptional timing 
goodbye  gentlemen 
so  i just spoke to your boss 
i think she got the message 
how are you
expecting this to end 
with me getting what i want 
which is what  exactly 
my father s safe return 
this has nothing to do
with your father 
look at you with that grin 
thinking you re
outsmarting everyone
in your little suit
and sunglasses 
you re enjoying all this 
you think it s a game 
game 
my father was kidnapped 
my father is dead 
can i trust you 
you ll have to 
you have no choice 
how did he die 
it was on the hill of tara 
he was ambushed
by one of our kind
because he d stolen
something called the aculos 
i ve read in my father s
journals about the aculos 
about a fairy
who swore to protect it 
a fairy named beechwood 
beechwood short was my father 
he knew how dangerous
the aculos can be 
it can open portals
between worlds 
a skeleton key
for the whole universe 
he hid it 
and for that  some say
that he was a criminal 
that s what they say
about my dad 
but you know it s not true 
that hurt 
artemis  it looks like
we ve got another visitor 
commander  time freeze
integrity down to 60  
understood 
hold it together  foaly 
mulch 
this is a one time offer 
fifty years off your sentence
if you ll dig your way
into fowl manor
and bring out officer short 
commander root 
do you mind if i call you   
i actually don t know
your first name 
let me guess  britney 
i m way off  aren t i 
it appears to me
like you ve got a big problem
on your hands 
but 
has anyone ever told you
you re like david bowie
if david bowie were a fairy 
so  essentially 
you re david bowie 
do you think
the humans will ever
find out he was one of us 
anyway 
50 years off my sentence
just isn t gonna cut it here 
i know what you want 
i can t give you that 
come on  root 
please 
i just   
i just want to be small 
i just want to be normal 
like the rest of my kind 
to be accepted 
you fairies got magic
coming out of your ears 
what have i got 
three  four feet i don t need 
look  a giant dwarf is exactly
what i need right now 
what i need right now 
a big  fast  hungry tunneler
who ll dig their way
into that house 
it s your choice 
either bring out officer short
or get back to jail 
listen to the two of us
grunting at each other
like a pair of hippos
with a throat infection 
a criminal 
a criminal 
that s what you think i am 
i am so much more
than a criminal 
um  technically  most of what
i do is criminal activity 
but i m also an artist 
you re picking my pocket 
okay  a hundred years
off my sentence
and a single cell
with no goblins 
single cell and 55 years 
  seventy five 
  sixty 
  seventy four 
  done  officers 
you reading me  mulch 
loud and clear  horsey 
dwarfus giaganticus 
dwarfus giaganticus 
everybody 
stand back 
it s feeding time 
i m in 
i know that sound 
mulch diggums 
mulch 
i m switching
your iris cam to x ray 
that s good 
you do you  foaly 
you might feel a slight pinch 
  you son of a   
  sorry 
what would your parents be 
we have a visitor 
what is it 
it s in the portrait gallery 
it s like a really  really
big dwarf 
yes 
right on schedule 
well  if i was
gonna be manipulated 
might as well be by the best 
and make no mistake 
the kid is the best 
house marks the spot 
what have we here 
the txtl 5000 
he s discovered a safe 
let him open it 
that s exactly what i want 
we meet again 
so  they ve sent in a dwarf 
look  i need your help 
listen  if i let you out 
will you promise not to
take command of my brain 
i want nothing to do
with that brain 
and   
bingo 
temperamental 
you ve evolved 
but so have i 
sounds like you re not
the only one opening locks 
by the way  if you run 
i will expose your existence
to the world 
you are my guest 
i invited you in 
the rules are clear 
they are  but you think
you can trust me 
now you can trust me 
fair enough 
let s find that dwarf 
eight new
motion sensitive tumblers 
you devil 
it can t be 
holy moly 
step back  mr  diggums 
it s real 
it s perfect 
the aculos 
the most powerful treasure
in the fairy world 
don t 
it will kill you if you use it 
if any human does 
i don t need to use it 
because my bargaining position
just got a whole lot stronger 
the fairies outside mustn t
get to hear that we have this 
i m sorry  human 
but they already know 
there s been a development 
they found the aculos 
as i expected 
in fowl manor 
you know what to do 
it s risky 
root has our entire army
at her disposal 
it s quite simple  cudgeon 
if you wish to survive
and thrive
in my brave new world 
then you will intervene now 
commander 
this time freeze
is seriously unstable 
this may not hold 
we ve lost one 
commander root 
you are hereby officially
relieved of your command
on authorization
of the executors 
you re making a mistake 
cudgeon 
my only mistake was not
doing this a long time ago 
with the aculos in play 
the game has changed 
time for a little direct action 
don t you think 
let me show you how it s done 
knock it off 
mistake 
i mean  really  big mistake 
this should wrap things up 
recognize our new recruit 
we fed it a little potion
of nettles and wasp juice 
everything trolls
are allergic to 
it s made it twice as strong
and 10 times as mad 
d arvit 
that can t be good 
go 
come on  let s go 
come on 
gods alive 
what is that 
a creature that consumes
humans in 2 97 seconds
and fairies in less than one 
get ready 
this is going all the way 
i ll need my gun 
jam all magic in the house 
but officer short 
she ll need hers to survive 
her father used his magic
against us 
i m not making the same
mistake twice  do as i say

and now 
the final piece of the plan 
the time freeze is ended 
they re gone

not yet  i can t give this
to opal koboi 
it s too powerful 
then what are you waiting for 
use its magic
to get your father back 
  i can t  not yet 
  i don t understand 
this holds a power
no human can access 
it s their source of magic 
as important to them
as the sun is to us 
you have to try 
i thought i could  but i can t 
holly said if any human
uses it  they ll die 
we re running out of time 
artemis  it s too dangerous 
exactly 
it s useless in my hands 
but not in mine 
you re late 
you know i m breaking
every rule in the book 
you like to break rules 
you can talk 
let s make a trade 
the aculos for my father 
how do i know i can trust you 
my father used to say 
 a friend s eye
is a good mirror  
are we friends 
artemis fowl 
we are 
forever friends 
we need to hurry 
your time is up 
the young genius artemis fowl
has failed his beloved father

i don t even know
that this will work 
you have to try 
carry me always 
carry me well 
i am thy teacher
of herb and spell 
i am thy link to power arcane 
forget me 
and thy magic shall wane 
die  fowl 
to power arcane 
forget me 
and thy magic shall wane 
carry me well  carry me well 
forget me  magic shall wane 
carry me well 
did it work

i don t know 
he can t be  please 
dad 
dad 
artemis   
i m so sorry 
it s over 
i ve lost him  haven t i 
artemis 
did you hear that 
dad  dad 
dad 
dad 
dad 
artemis 
no 
how 
how did you save me  son 
i just followed the story 
with a little help
from a friend 
dad 
meet officer holly short 
daughter of beechwood short 
your father was a great man
and a dear friend 
he brought me the aculos
because there are forces
in your world
who wanted its power
for themselves 
so  he was trying to protect it 
yes 
yes  yes  he was 
and he did 
with his life 
your father was a hero  holly 
just like you 
he  gave me this list 
it s a list of names
that i can t even pronounce 
these are opal s accomplices 
we were looking for them
when i was captured 
they re the ones
you ll want to investigate 
i m sorry for your loss 
thank you very much 
  it s so good to see you 
  i am not going to cry 
i m not going to cry 
the aculos is safe at last 
now that we know our enemies 
thanks to you  holly 
quite the day 
yes  commander 
curb that maverick streak in you
and you ll make
a decent officer someday 
thank you  commander 
this place needs
fairies like you 
our world has never been
so much in danger 
it s not perfect  holly 
but it s ours 
it s a light to guide us 
and it s worth fighting for 
i want you to investigate
every name
on your father s list 
me 
well  who else am i talking to 
nobody else  commander  just me 
  go on 
  i m going to   
you won t regret   
i will not   
  go on 
  i ll just go 
here we go  dad 
  nice work  holly 
  well done  holly 
all right  team 
here we go 
this is a community
still coming to terms
with these stunning revelations 
the family has lived
in the house
for generations
and is well known locally 
but there s a sense of real
shock here that artemis fowl 
who neighbors describe
as quiet and   
it would appear we ve garnered
quite a bit of interest 
not ideal 
the media 
i have someone
working on that right now 
i expected you would 
these are for you  son 
just don t forget to wash it
before you bring it back  okay 
where are we going 
to finish this 
you think i m ready 
i know you re ready 
first  i have a call to make 
you failed  opal 
you were wrong about my father 
about beechwood 
about everything 
and now   
we re coming for you 
you think you can beat me 
you have no idea the world
that you have just entered  boy 
just who do you think you are 
i m artemis fowl   
and i m a criminal mastermind 
what an extraordinary ending
to your remarkable fairy tale 
but let s get back
to the thief  shall we 
he will be brought to justice 
and you will not leave here
until you assist us 
you really don t believe
any of it 
the only thing
in that fanciful tale
i did believe
is that you can be bought 
so  let us offer you a deal 
help us apprehend
artemis fowl  sr  
and then you ll walk 
tsk 
or perhaps i offer you a deal 
i walk out on my own 
and you leave
the fowls alone forever 
and why would we ever do that 
so that you can
all sleep at night 
knowing that the fairy tales
you tell your kids
remain beautiful dreams 
and not living nightmares 
and the next time
you see the fowls 
be sure to thank them
for protecting us all 
they keep the peace 
don t ever forget it 
that s why artemis
set up my arrest 
that s why i m here 
he figured
you d have to believe me 
alert the guards 
i hope you don t get squeamish 
lockdown 
immediate lockdown 
a tracking device 
designed by the kid 
clap your hands
if you believe in fairies 
that s my ride 
lockdown 
get back here 
you filthy little dwarf 
dwarfus giaganticus 
don t mind me  i got this 
are you ready
to get back to work 
i thought you d never ask
