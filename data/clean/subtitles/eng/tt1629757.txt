frosty 
oh  yeah  you re smiling now  big shot 
but if i hadn t paddled around the point
at that exact moment    
it s a miracle  that s what it is 
and i don t believe in miracles 
how old are you 
what  6  7 
eight 
and three quarters  sir 
well  you just used up your entire
allotment of dumb luck 
here s a novel idea 
on your next little date 
why don t you go to the arcade   
   or pee wee golfing 
or something that doesn t
involve getting you killed 
because he likes to time the waves 
shh 
kim 
what  you do 
what do you mean  time the waves 
um  to see if the swell is building or dropping 
the more seconds between them   
   each wave in a set 
it means it s getting bigger 
who taught you that 
nobody  sir 
just figured it out 
you just figured that out on your own 
okay 
jay 
thanks  bye 
bye  okay 
kim  bye 
go straight inside  all right 
close the door 
what now 
how big you reckon that wave was  sir 
it s a small world  kid   
   but how they gauge the size
of waves  well  that differs   
   from place to place 
so  hard to say 
so it might be bigger somewhere else 
look   
   it was definitely
big enough  okay 
like i said  kid  small world 
i appreciate you saving sophie  jay 
one of the bravest things i ve ever seen 
 baby crying

officer 2 
this is victor 1 2  we re on the scene 
 van door opens 
 engine starts 
 van door closes 
man  on radio   offshore buoys
are reporting seas of 25 feet at 16 seconds 
coming from the west northwest at 295 degrees 
northwest winds are
forecasted at 15 to 20 knots 
swells are expected to reach up to 28 feet   
   at 17 seconds near shore 
frosty  morning  frank 
careful out there  son 
hey  buddy 
what s up 
next level out there today  boys 
twenty five at 16 
let s rock and roll 
right 
let s do it 
jay 
yeah  frosty 
frosty  now  we ll agree to forget
how you got up here   
   but as far as most are concerned  that
wave s a myth  like a loch ness monster 
the four of us who surf there
want to keep it that way  is that clear 
man  buoys reporting swells of 28 feet
at 17 seconds coming from  
 turns off radio 
 sighs 
how big was that wave 
did you hear what i just said 
yes  sir 
loch ness monster 
 sighs 
how s it going over there 
mom s not renting out the back anymore 
means i get my own room 
but i got to double up
my shifts at pleasure pizza 
and your father 
he wrote me a letter a few years
back from his base in panama 
so what d he say 
i don t know 
never opened it 
all right  well   
   i got to get out of here 
got to get to work 
hey  sir  i want to ride that wave 
i want to take that drop 
not gonna happen 
why not 
because untrained boys don t step in the ring   
   with mike tyson 
that s why 
i can handle it 
you don t just do it 
buddy  i ve been surfing
that break for 20 years 
you have any idea how much
strength and know how you need   
   to survive a break like that 
frosty  i m getting stronger by the day 
i ll hold my own 
stronger by the day  huh 
yeah 
okay  give me your hand 
now resist me 
okay  that all you got 
 grunting 
is that it  is that it 
ow  ow  ow  ow 
okay  you ain t strong enough 
right now  i m surfing every single day  right 
so  if i  
shut up  all right 
now  i know how good you are 
i ve seen you out there 
you surf circles around those other kids 
but those are normal waves 
surfing normal waves is about how you perform   
   when everything goes right 
now  big wave surfing 
that s a different ball game 
that s about how you perform
when everything goes wrong 
one bump off the face of that wave   
   and you re hitting the water
like concrete at 50 miles an hour 
and you got a thousand tons of
water coming down on top of you 
it s knocking you senseless 
ripping you apart   
   and pushing you down
to a place that is so deep   
   and so dark  you don t
want to be there 
so why do it 
heh  come on  get out of here 
i got work to do 
train me  then  train me to ride it 
did you hear what i said 
go on  get 
brenda 
you don t get it  do you 
what 
there are all kinds of sons  frosty  you know 
some are born to you and some just occur to you 
jay has looked up to you his entire life 
i mean  can t you see how much he needs you 
you want me to teach him to surf that wave 
he s a kid 
you made me promise
i wouldn t even surf that  
yeah  and you break that promise
every chance you get 
you think i don t know
where you were this morning 
i heard the message on the machine 
 25 at 16   come on 
i don t know where you re going with this 
that boy s gonna surf that wave
anyway  you know that  right 
even if he dies trying 
i mean  wouldn t you 
 cornershop s  brimful of asha 
playing over speakers 
she s the one that keeps the dream alive
blond 
okay  two hawaiians  two santa barbara   
   one pepperoni and one cheese 
all right 
girl 
thank you 
well  it s a brimful of asha
dude  dude 
it goes  first sauce 
then cheese  then toppings 
it s not rocket science 
you all right  you haven t been here
since you got here  man 
you ever see something and you think   
   like  it s the reason you were put here 
i mean  like  on this earth 
sure  man 
every time i turn on baywatch 
 phone ringing 
blond  right  keep it moving 
pleasure pizza  okay 
hey  blond  i ll be right back 
hold on  hold on 
hey  dude  where are you going now 
i ll be right back 
blond  you re killing me here 
hi  sir 
okay  here s the deal 
i m gonna train you for one thing
and for one thing only 
to survive that wave  all right 
you want to know why 
because i don t want it
on my conscience  that s it 
no questions  no arguing  end of story 
i teach you what you need
to know  and it s over 
you got it 
got it 
now  the reason   
   no one knows about this wave   
   is because it only happens
on big northwest swells 
and the window for those swells
closes in 12 weeks 
so you got 12 weeks 
meet me in my shed
tomorrow morning  6 30 a m 
not 6 31 or 6 32 
yes  yes  yes 
hey  ooh 
don t bother with that 
we re not surfing 
paddleboards 
all right  unh 
a few things we need to
establish before we begin 
first   
   thou shalt not ding frosty s board
or damage thy neighbor s car 
yes  sir  sorry  sir 
second  this little  uh  program   
   is all about building
what i like to call   
   the four pillars of a solid
human foundation  understand 
yes  sir 
how could you 
i haven t even told you what they are 
steady rhythm 
drive and glide 
the four pillars of the human foundation   
   are the physical  the mental 
the emotional and the spiritual 
though i admit to being a little
bit wobbly in that department 
jay 
i m not sure i understand  sir 
frosty 
you know what a thesis is 
uh  an idea 
exactly 
an idea which attempts to explain something 
lays it out to be proved or disproved 
so here s our thesis 
it s 36 miles across the bay
from santa cruz to monterey 
the day that you can paddle that far will be
the day you re ready to surf mavericks 
not a moment sooner 
frosty  that s impossible 
oh  more so than you know 
so the physical will represent the sheer
strength needed to make the paddle 
so you re gonna be doing this
from now on  every day   
   12 weeks 
and the mental will be   
   tied to your own research 
the calculation of the tides and swells   
   and  of course  your ability
to navigate them all 
so  monterey equals mavericks 
deal 
deal 
good 
all i need is for your mom to sign me
a permission slip accepting responsibility   
   for anything that s
gonna happen along the way 
whoa  frosty 
hey  frosty  what if she doesn t sign it 
deep breaths  steady rhythm 
drive and glide 
 mazzy star s  blue light 
playing softly over speakers 
 sophie whimpering 
hey  sophie  what s up  girl 
come here  sophie 
shh 
sophie  what are you   
what are you doing here 
my parents are asleep 
can you sign me a permission slip
with my mom s signature on it 
my handwriting blows 
heh  a permission slip 
for what 
okay  i haven t told this to anyone 
so you have to promise to keep it a secret 
okay  promise 
it s mavericks  i mean  it s real 
maybe the biggest wave in the world 
i ve seen it with my own eyes 
it s right up the coast 
frosty s gonna train me to surf it 
mavericks 
no one believes that 
i swear  it s like nothing
you ve ever seen before 
and if i ask my mom for permission   
   it ll just give her an excuse to act like my
mom for once and she ll probably say no 
you look great 
thanks 
i would ve asked you at school 
but i know you don t like   
   being seen in public
with younger men  so    
 chuckles 
sonny 
hey  blondie 
 sonny   blond speaking indistinctly 
blond 
all right  fellas 
come on  race you to the pool

you told me to be here at 4 
exactly 
jay 
so  we ready to go 
does it look like it 
tell you what  we ll be ready   
   when you clean up
that driveway 
that s what you get for being 20 minutes early 
frosty 
deep breaths 
you got to stretch out those lungs 
a wave like mavericks will hold
you down for minutes at a time   
   while it pounds
you to a pulp 
lf you can t hold your breath   
   for at least four minutes
under normal circumstances   
   then you may as well
not even paddle out 
 gasps 
how long was that 
you know what  i m not even gonna
acknowledge that just happened 
frosty 
hey 
where d you find that 
in the dresser that you
moved into the baby s room 
hm  god  you re so beautiful 
mm 
look  um  i know that surfing is   
   your passion and your life 
your escape 
i get it 
but i need you to make me a promise 
and i m serious this time 
that you re not gonna put
the rush of a 30 foot drop   
   in front of the future
of your two children 
 sighs 
i promise 
god  you re a good man 
okay 
jay s waiting for you 
mom 
mom  you got to get up right now

 thunder rumbling 
hey

yeah  sorry  frosty  you know  my mom  
she had to write my permission slip  so    
your mother s got nice handwriting 
she take much convincing 
no

hm  yeah 
you want to be an athlete 
you got to eat like one  take this 
go on  take it 
you re gonna need it more than me 
jay 
thanks 
man  on radio  
winds out of the south  southeast   
   at 15 knots 
gusting to 20 knots 
that s the weather radio  huh 
you use it to follow big surf 
kind of like you timing the waves 
only this thing s a little more accurate 
 chuckles 
there s no way to paddle out there   
   especially with long boards 
oh  there s a way  all right 
so let s see if you re worth your salt  chief 
okay  back to baking 
let s go 
so you made it all of 30 yards 
lf you want to get out there 
you got to make it   
   through more than half
a mile of this   
   just to get in position
of mavericks 
so you ve got to conserve
all the energy you ve got 
all right 
now let s take a look at what you missed 
now  for some reason  you decided   
   to paddle straight out
into that mess 
now  take a look at the rocks over there 
see what s happening with the current 
it s got nowhere to go 
nowhere to go but where 
back out 
exactly  back out 
to a waterman   
   it s a conveyor belt 
watch this 
frosty 
so today s lesson   
   was about the power
of observation 
simple fact is you got two choices 
you can fight
things head on   
   or you can observe
the laws of nature 
because if you look hard enough   
   there s always
a way through it 
make sense 
yes  sir 
good man 
because you re going to
write me an essay about it 
three pages 
typewritten  single space 
devil s in the details of whatever you observe 
time to start building
your mental pillar  chief 
jay 
hey  kimmy 
oh  my gosh 
are you okay 
yeah 
oh  man 
what are you doing 
uh  i just got off work 
you 
oh  um  i was just trying to go for a swim   
   but i guess they close
early on sundays 
you want to go swimming at night   
   you got to use
the back entrance 
 grunting 
hey  this isn t so bad 
okay  so how do we get down 
jay 
there s only one way i know of 
what  no 
are you serious 
no 
jay 
blond  hey 
i saw your bike 
you didn t tell me 
so she know the rules 
no 
clear it  clear it 
excuse me 
it s kind of like figure skating 
points based on a combination   
   of style  execution
and difficulty 
for example  i m going to start
with a standing one and a half 
high  i repeat  high level of difficulty 
because i got to clear the pool deck 
hit that  you re immediately dq d 
no  wait  wait  wait 
you guys aren t serious 
really  no 
 matthew sweet s  girlfriend  playing 
oh    
oh 
and the judges say    
kim  oh  my gosh 
jay  nice one  blondie 
the only thing that can top that
is a reverse back tuck 
because of the blind entry 
kim  no 
i can t watch this 
you have to 
you re the only judge 
no  jay 
whoo 
i wanna love somebody
 both cheering 
i hear you need somebody to love
whoo 
look at this  yeah 
 whooping 
i hear you re looking for someone to love
and the judge turned competitor
ties it with moriarity 
no 
jay  no  no  no 
to see who the real champion will be   
   we re down to a final sprint  whoo 
back in the arms of a girlfriend
i didn t know nobody
and then i saw you coming my way
ooh 
hey  you cheater 
ooh 
you are disqualified 
why 
kim 
because you pulled my ankle 
i would have won that 
whatever 
 speaking indistinctly 
forty

four pillars of a solid human foundation 
fifty 
mm hm

oh  thank you 
brenda 
you re welcome 
is this some sort of a joke 
no  sir 
frosty 
so i ask you to write an essay   
   and you observe a girl 
you never told me what to observe 
frosty  oh  come on  jay  really 
i m training you to survive
mavericks  not some  uh   
   silly teen crush 
roque  go to bed 
good night  daddy 
i just thought  
frosty  what did you think 
what did you think  jay 
nothing 
lf you didn t think  you re wasting my time 
frosty 
okay 
and that s not something
i got a lot of these days 
you know what 
it s not your fault 
you re 15  you re just a kid 
jay  um  will you excuse us for a moment 
 frosty sighs 
for heaven s sake  frosty  not everyone
sees the world through your eyes 
okay  he chose to examine something
that meant the world to him 
something personal   
   which he opened up
and shared with you  entrusted   
   to you 
brenda  i m not concerned with his feelings 
i m concerned with the objective 
the point of writing an essay
is to put your thoughts   
   down on paper
and see the gaps and reflect 
and did he accomplish that or not 
 sighs 
i don t know  i  
my old man  he didn t even  
shh  shh  shh 
 brenda sighs 
it just takes patience 
you owe yourself that much 
okay 
okay 
i don t hear lake 
hey 
he just needed to be held  i think 
don t we all sometimes 
all right  chief  sit down 
from now on  let s stick to the subject at hand

coming down the mountain
i don t mind the sun sometimes
the images it shows
i can taste you on my lips
and smell you in my clothes
cinnamon and sugary and softly spoken lies
you never know just how to look
through other people s eyes
i don t mind the sun sometimes
the images it shows
i can taste you on my lips
and smell you in my clothes
cinnamon and sugary and softly spoken lies
you never know just how you look
through other people s eyes
whoo 
yeah 
 saw whirring 
hey 
you re back early 
what you doing 
you know  it s  uh  
he wanted to surprise you 
well  he succeeded 
carry on 
 girl speaking indistinctly 
blond 
you re the worst  you re the worst 
hey  did you see that big
outside set  it was firing today 
 grunts 
blond 
careful  man  he s wasted 
sonny 
uh  yeah  let me get a  um  
a hot dog  extra chili 
ahem  no  check that 
make it a jelly donut 
all we got is pizza  bro 
hey  little trash   
   why are you always smiling
all the time  huh 
oh  there you go again 
you see  when you smile 
you look like a little wuss 
when you look like a little wuss 
you don t get no respect 
blond 
sure got it today 
hey  hey  hey  get off 
 all grunting 
come on  get off me  man 
sonny  you throw a punch   
   you better pray i don t make it
back up  you little punk 
yeah  you think you re better
than the rest of us  don t you 
i see you paddling out there
every morning with frosty 
boy 
come on  man  let s get out of here 
paddle  paddle  paddle  little grom 
let s go  bro 
let s get out of here 
looks like you dropped something 
frosty 
i read your essay 
what do you think 
i think that s what i expected
from you all along 
you done good  chief 
frosty 
and now the lion sleeps 
the wave is gonna break behind us
where the reef falls   
   from about 40 feet
to about 1500 feet 
here s what you want
to avoid  firstly   
   see those rocks
over there 
they call that the boneyard 
whatever you do 
do not let the current push you in there 
it ll smash you to pieces 
so where do you set 
what you got to do is triangulate 
you draw a line between
yourself and that dish   
   and that mushroom rock
over there 
the biggest treachery of all
is what lies underneath 
frosty 
most waves break on reefs   
   less than 20 feet
beneath the surface 
depth is doubled out here 
meaning  when it s firing 
you got twice the water mass   
   twice the wave energy   
   and twice the iikelihood
of drowning 
 jay gasps then coughs 
don t worry  i got your back  kid 
what happened 
what do you mean 
i just saw a 15 foot shark 
i m sure it scared the piss out of you  but
that wasn t what i asked  why d you panic 
just fear  i guess 
all right  well  one thing you got to know   
   fear and panic
are two separate emotions 
fear is healthy  panic is deadly 
because when this place is firing   
   and i m talking
about 30   40 foot waves   
   it s all about fear  but you panic
out there  like you just did   
   you die 
well  if you re scared to death 
how do you not panic 
by identifying the fear
and what it is you re afraid of 
not just out there  but in life 
welcome to your next essay

frost  i saw you were counting

frosty  the longer you re down there 
the more your mind unspools 
you mark each minute with a finger 
run out of fingers   
   and you know
you re in trouble 
feel the water getting colder 
yeah 
because of what lies beneath us 
it s the monterey trench  5 280 feet deep 
current drops in here 
heads east until it hits the southern wall 
creating what 
it s a back eddy 
you know  the day you hit that eddy is
the day you ll be more than halfway there 
where d you learn all that stuff anyway 
from you 
i mean  from books and maps 
you told me to study the currents and the tides 
yeah  i guess i did  didn t i 
used to come out here and just
paddle out to the deepest part 
used to bob up and down like a cork just    
just to feel it 
to feel what 
the abyss 
jay 
the tide is really strong today 
that s because of
tropical hurricanes from japan 
making their way across the pacific 
really 
only happens once every seven to 10 years

brought waves into mavericks   
   the size
of five story buildings

frosty said that you might be
needing that to follow the swells 
and he said there is a very big one coming

drop in on me  all right 
man  on radio  
strong el niño induced winter storms   
   are queued up
in the gulf of alaska   
   and progressing eastward
towards california 
the burst is producing 55 knot
winds and seas to 40 feet 
large ocean swells are expected to arrive   
 raises volume on radio 
   resulting in large breaking waves
with heights to 35 feet 
 knocking continues 
hey  it s pouring out there 
how you been 
good 
kim   
   what s wrong 
we ve been friends forever 
you don t have to do this  just tell me 
it s just complicated 
not from where i m sitting 
that s because you only see
the good in everything 
most of us spend all of our time   
   dwelling on all the what ifs
and just looking for   
   all the reasons why things
could never work out 
and what if you re wrong 
then you show up to a pizza parlor   
   late one night  in the rain 
ever since we were little kids  jay   
   i ve just had this feeling
deep down inside   
   that you re the one   
   and i m gonna spend
the rest of my life with you 
what 
what s wrong 
man  on radio   be advised  there is
an extremely high surf advisory in effect 
buoys reporting 32 feet at 18 seconds 
 phone ringing

okay 
okay  i ll call kim 
are you sure you don t wanna come 
i just want you to come home 
frosty

all right  then 
because of that   
   there ll be a lot of cowboys out there
today trying to prove themselves 
some of them are gonna get hurt 
so keep your distance
and keep your focus  all right 
so a swell with this much west   
   means sets will be shifting

   and that my mom
will never find happiness 
i m afraid of losing kim

jay 
i know this sounds strange   
   but i ve always felt like
i wouldn t be around for very long   
   which is why
i want to take that drop 
because once i iook down over the edge   
   and i catch it 
i ll become a part of it 
and in that moment  i ll know that i m alive 
 all cheering 
frosty 
jay became famous that day   
   not for riding giants   
   but for the courage of a boy
who dared the impossible 
over the years  he rose to
the peak of the surfing world   
   his prowess matched
only by his joy 
the true prince amidst a sport of kings 
he married his childhood sweetheart
and swore himself true 
as for the rest   
   all i will say is  the ones
who push the limits discover   
   the limits sometimes push back 
to jay 
all 
to jay 
to jay 
 all cheering 
yeah 
 greg holden s  i need an energy  playing 
frosty 
we all come from the sea   
   but we re not all of the sea 
those of us who are  we children of the tides   
   must return to it
again and again   
   until the day
we don t come back   
   leaving behind only that   
   which was touched
along the way 
jay 
you just got to appreciate everything 
um  i think that s one of
the most important things in life   
   is just really appreciating it   
   because  you know 
we only get to do this once 
and it s not for a long time  so enjoy it 
  yeah   
  i need a lift   
  i need a shake  
  i need to find another chance
