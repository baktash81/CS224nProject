of the great warrior  mulan 
but  ancestors 
this one is mine 
here she is 
a young shoot  all green   
unaware of the blade 
if you had such a daughter   
her chi  the boundless energy
of life itself   
speaking through
her every motion   
could you tell her that
only a son could wield chi 
that a daughter would risk
shame  dishonor  exile 
ancestors  i could not 
 indistinct chatter 
 chicken clucking 
zhou  this way 
that s the last one 
gently 
 chicken squawking 
mulan  forget the chicken 
it will come back 
 chicken squawking 
 gasps 
no 
   woman screaming 
   chicken clucking 
tell me your sister
is not the cause of this 
   gasps 
   baby cries 
mulan 
  take control of yourself 
   giggling 
 clucking and squawking 
 all exclaiming 
   grunts 
   chicken clucking 
zhou  mulan 
listen very carefully 
no 
 villagers grumbling 
mulan  what happened
when you fell off the roof 
it was like you were a bird 
don t panic 
there s a spider
crawling in your hair 
you know
i m afraid of spiders 
this is not one of
your tricks  is it  mulan 
don t worry 
if you hold very still   
i will squash it 
li  it is because i m trying
to protect mulan
that i say this 
mulan is young 
she is still learning
how to control herself 
you make excuses for her 
you forget  mulan is
a daughter  not a son 
a daughter brings honor
through marriage 
any man would be fortunate to
marry either of our daughters 
including mulan 
i ask you  what man will want
to marry a girl
who flits around rooftops 
chasing chickens 
xiu gives me no trouble 
the matchmaker will find
a good husband for her 
it is mulan i worry about 
they ll call her a witch 
it s time you talked to her 
 zhou grunts 
do you know why the phoenix
sits at the entrance
of our shrine 
she is the emissary
for our ancestors 
but i broke her 
 chuckles 
some say the phoenix
is consumed by flame   
and emerges again 
i think she can survive
a broken wing 
your chi is strong  mulan 
but chi is for warriors   
not daughters 
soon  you ll be
a young woman   
and it is time for you   
to hide your gift away 
to   
to silence its voice 
i say this to protect you 
that is my job 
your job is to bring honor
to the family 
 sniffles 
do you think you can do that 
 men shouting indistinctly 
 indistinct chatter 
rourans  it can t be 
  close the gates 
   guards shout in panic 
take out the leader 
 people exclaim in fear

 people screaming 
xianniang  you  you ll do 
chancellor  your majesty   
six of our northern garrisons
along the silk road   
have fallen
in a coordinated attack 
all trade has been disrupted 
if we allow this to continue 
it could be
the end of the kingdom 
and my citizens 
slaughtered 
this soldier
is the only survivor 
i fear
more attacks will follow 
who is responsible 
rourans  your majesty 
their leader calls himself
böri khan 
i killed böri khan 
it is his son 
he has united the tribes
and resurrected
the rouran army 
if i may 
your imperial majesty 
emperor  you may speak 
böri khan
fights alongside a woman 
her chi is beyond imagining 
there is no place
for witches in this kingdom 
it is forbidden
to use the power of chi
in destructive ways 
and yet  it is her skill
that leads the rouran army
to victory 
she has trained an elite force
of shadow warriors
to assist böri khan 
emperor  we re not afraid
of dark magic 
we ll destroy this rouran army
and their witch 
here s my decree 
we ll build a mighty army 
every family
will supply one man 
we ll protect
our beloved people   
  an8 and crush these murderers 
deploy the imperial army 
the dynasty
will not be threatened 
 indistinct chatter 
 hawk screams 
 indistinct chatter 
böri khan  so  you have news 
xianniang 
the emperor sends his army
to defend the silk road 
böri khan  good 
we will crush every garrison
until the imperial army
is on its knees 
and then   
the imperial city
will be laid bare 
the emperor
will be mine to kill 
you have proved useful  witch 
xianniang  not witch 
warrior 
 exhales shakily 
i could tear you to pieces
before you blink 
böri khan  but you won t 
remember what you want   
a place where your powers
will not be vilified 
a place where you are accepted
for who you are 
you won t get what you want
without me 
when i found you
on a desert steppe
wandering alone   
you were exiled 
a scorned dog 
when i sit on the throne 
that dog will have a home 
 chuckles 
we will finish
what we started 
and you will see to it
that nothing and no one
stands in my way 
 urges horse 
 horse whinnies 
black wind and i
rode alongside
two rabbits
running side by side 
i think one was a male 
one was a female 
but you know 
you can t really tell
when they re running
that fast 
when i go riding tomorrow 
i will try to find them again 
maybe they ll still be there 
we have excellent news 
the matchmaker has found you
an auspicious match 
yes  mulan  it is decided 
come and sit down 
 xiu sighs 
it is what is best
for our family 
yes 
it is best 
i will bring honor to us all 
 sneezes 
i m truly blessed
to be in the presence
of such enchanting women 
i have no doubt today will be
a momentous day for the hua   
never mind that 
we must be on time 
mulan  i m starving 
i already told you 
you cannot eat 
it will ruin your makeup 
the fiercest winter storm
could not destroy this makeup 
xiu  look at my face 
what am i feeling 
xiu  i have no idea 
 whispers  exactly 
this is my sad face 
this is my curious face 
and now i m confused 
 both laughing 
quiet 
composed 
graceful 
elegant 
poised 
polite 
these are the qualities   
we see in a good wife 
these are the qualities   
we see in mulan 
when a wife
serves her husband   
 gulps 
   she must be silent 
 exhales deeply 
she must be   
invisible 
she must be   
is something wrong 
no  madam matchmaker 
thank you 
it s ideal for the teapot   
to remain

i know your father 
he was a great soldier

the chi pervades the universe
and all living things 
we are all born with it 
but only the most true will
connect deeply to his chi   
and become a great warrior 
tranquil as a forest   
but on fire within 
the rouran enemy is vast 
they are ruthless
and unpredictable 
yet physical force
need not be met
with equal force 
the warrior yields to force
and redirects it

up until now  you ve been

you saved them today

you are just at the beginning

merge your path with mine 
we will be stronger together 
you follow a coward 
a leader who runs from battle 
böri khan
did not run from battle

will take the imperial city

we must ride to the emperor 
his life is in danger 
the emperor s life

that s what böri khan
wants you to believe 
please 
you have to listen to me 
sergeant  hand me my sword 
kill me if you must 
but first  listen 
the garrison attacks
were just a distraction 
khan has our army focused
on the silk road   
so he can sneak
into the imperial city
and kill the emperor 
böri khan
is already far ahead 
the imperial army
can t stop him now 
but perhaps a small 
well trained force could 
when employed correctly   
four ounces
can move 1 000 pounds 
only a foolish man listens to
someone whose very existence

you would believe hua jun

you question the judgement
of his majesty the emperor 
of course not  chancellor

böri khan  surely you didn t

how did you convince
my chancellor to betray me

 slow tempo pop music playing 
war is not freedom
over my shoulder
i see a clearer view
all for my family
reason i m breathing
everything to lose
should i ask myself
in the water
what a warrior would do 
tell me underneath my armor
am i loyal  brave  and true 
am i loyal  brave  and true 
losing is easy
winning takes bravery
i am a tiger s fool
out in the open
no one to save me
the kindest of whispers
are cruel
  an8 should i ask myself
in the water
  an8 what a warrior would do 
  an8 tell me underneath my armor
  an8 am i loyal  brave  and true 
  an8 am i loyal  brave  and true 
  an8 cold is the morning
  an8 warm is the dream
  an8 chasing the answers
  an8  til i can t sleep
  an8 will i be stronger
or will i be weak
when you re not with me 
  an8 who am i without my armor
  an8 standing in my father s shoes 
all i know is that it s harder
to be loyal  brave  and true
  an8  soft music playing 
look at me
you may think you see
who i really am
but you ll never know me
every day
it s as if i play a part
now i see
if i wear a mask
i can fool the world
but i cannot fool my heart
who is that girl i see
staring straight back at me 
when will my reflection show
who i am inside 
i am now
in a world
where i have to hide my heart
and what i believe in
but somehow
i will show the world
what s inside my heart
and be loved for who i am
who is that girl i see
staring straight back at me 
why is my reflection someone
i don t know 
must i pretend
that i m someone else
for all time 
when will my reflection show
who i am inside 
there s a heart
that must be free
to fly
that burns with a need to know
the reason why
why must we all conceal
what we think  how we feel 
must there be a secret me
i m forced to hide 
i won t pretend that i m
someone else for all time
when will my reflection show
who i am inside
