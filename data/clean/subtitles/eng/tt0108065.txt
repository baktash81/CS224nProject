plane after plane
waited on the runway
while he napped
or took walks
and ate sandwiches 
henry kissinger called
and asked him to go
for his country s honor 
soon after arriving 
he offended the icelanders
by calling their country
inadequate
because they had
no bowling alleys 
he complained
about the tv cameras 
about the lighting 
about the table and chairs 
and the contrast of
the squares on the board 
his hotel room  he said 
had too nice a view 
none of this had anything
to do with chess  of course   
or maybe it did 
if he won 
he d be the first american
world champion in history 
if he lost 
he d just be another
patzer from brooklyn 
on the 40th move
of the 21st game 
he countered
spassky s bishop to king 6
with a pawn to rook 4 
and it was all over 
he came home an american hero 
he bragged to the world
he d beat the russians 
he delivered 
he can now command the same money
as heavyweight prizefighters 
he was invited to dinner
by statesmen and kings 
then bobby fischer made the most
original  unexpected move of all 
he disappeared 
where is he 
maybe he gave up 
shh

games to amuse him
while their mother was at work 
monopoly   
parcheesi   
chess 
even though
she was five years older 
she was soon no match for him 
it became more interesting
for him to play against himself

of the board equally hard 
careful to be fair   
and he always won

say good night to your brother 
good night 
there 
mom 
yeah 
does vinnie sleep in the park 
to be honest with you 
i have no idea where he lives 
well  i was thinking   
maybe he could sleep
in my top bunk instead 
then when i get old enough to sleep
in it  he could sleep down here 
you have a good heart 
and that s the most important
thing in the world 
good night 
good night  mom 
glad you could make it 
so how s it going 
all right 
great 
that s great 
so what do you think 
have you ever been
to a tournament before 
no 
ah  you re
in luck then 
this is one of the
most prestigious 
the talent gathered here s the strongest
in the country  everybody s here 
joel benjamin   
former u s  champion 
among the six highest rated
players in the country 
the man in the corner s
roman dzindzichashvili 
two time u s  champion 
a few years ago  he was ranked among
the top 10 players of the world 
asa hoffman 
he s the son of two lawyers 
he grew up on park avenue 
went to columbia and horace mann
before dropping out
to play chess full time 
he plays about 200 chess
tournaments a year 
asa 
asa 
how much do you make at the
tournaments altogether   
about  2 000 a year 
look at that  i got him thinking 
i got him thinking 
maybe i can win a pawn 
clearly  you had me come here
so i could see all this 
but if you really
wanted me to say no
to letting my son play 
you wouldn t have bothered 
you want me to think
you want me to say no 
but you actually   
want me to say yes 
you have no idea what i want 
what is chess  do you think 
those who play for fun
or not at all 
dismiss it as a game 
the ones who devote their lives to it 
for the most part 
insist it is a science 
it s neither 
bobby fischer got underneath it
like no one before him and
found at its center   
art 
i ve spent my life
trying to play like him 
most of these guys have 
but we re like forgers 
we re competent fakes 
his successor
wasn t here tonight 
he wasn t here 
he s asleep in his room
in your house 
your son creates like fischer 
he sees like him   
inside 
you can tell that
by watching him play
some drunks in the park 
yes 
you want to know what i want 
i ll tell you what i want 
i want back
what bobby fischer took with
him when he disappeared 
yeah  look at that 
oh 
you re his father 
it s your decision 
josh 
i    i d like you to meet
a friend of mine

  bye 
  bye 
the first lesson went
very well  i think 
oh  good 
so  uh   
uh  were you guys   
talking about   
chess up there 
no  it didn t come up 
so i ll see you
next saturday then 
uh  right 
that s great 
so long 
how about some pac man
next week  josh 
pac man and pizza 
great 
o k 
i ll see myself out 
it was very nice meeting you 
mate is four moves
from the position
in front of you 
don t move until you figure
it out in your head 
don t look to me for a hint 
i can t do it without
moving the pieces 
yes  you can 
clear the lines of men
in your head 
one at a time 
and the king will
be left standing alone 
like a guy on a street corner 
here  i ll make it
easier for you 
knight to c8 
good 
i want to show you
something else 
this is very rare 
it says   master
chess certificate   
awarded to    
and there s a blank here
for a name   
 for highest achievement
on this day of blank 
nineteen hundred and blank  
careful with it 
it s a mysterious
and powerful thing 
it s only been given out   
i don t know   
a few times in history 
and then only to those who achieve
a lot of master class points 
then there s a big
ceremony and so on 
  how do you get master class points 
  you earn them 
you just earned 10   
for that knight to c8 
10 
10   
master   
class   
points 
o k   josh  let s go 
go  go  go  go 
go  go  go  go 
take two 
go  go  go  go 
hi 
you re overdressed  bruce 
two  four  six  eight 
who do we appreciate 
eagles 
eagles 
yeah  eagles 
o k   yeah 
nice game guys 
let s get that equipment
in and head on out 
good game  fellas 
come on  josh 
his chess ideas are like pieces of
his body he s reluctant to give up 
for instance  he simply
can t cope with being told
not to bring his queen out
too early in the game 
why shouldn t he 
he s won many a game in washington
square doing exactly that 
why is this suddenly wrong 
try getting him to brush
his teeth sometime 
what i m trying to teach him
and what he s learning there
are two very different things 
park hustlers play
tactics  not position 
they rely on wild 
unpredictable moves
meant to intimidate
their opponents 
great in a two minute
speed game for drug money 
but it ll cost josh
dearly in real games 
well  he s learning
some new words 
could you keep him from
playing there so much 
sure 
no 
not playing in the park
would kill him  he loves it 
just makes my job harder 
then your job s harder 
what are you talking about 
we re already packed 
we re  like  out the door 
make sure his laces are tight
if there s escalators 
i don t know why
i o k  d this anyway 
well  you didn t 
he wants to do this 
i should ve dissuaded him 
i grew up playing
in tournaments 
they have nothing to do
with what s important 
they re about all
winning and losing  so 
it s not chess 
ah  chess is art 
that s right 
no  chess is you appreciate
the beauty of josh s play
at 60 bucks an hour 
will you be ready to go
in 30 minutes or not 
he s not coming 
may i talk to him 
hold on 
josh 
i don t   
telephone 
hi 
josh  how are you doing 
you excited 
yeah 
listen  i can t make it 
i ve got some things
i have to take care of 
hmm 
that s o k 
i ll be thinking of you 
you ll do great  i know it 
and i ll see you
when you get back 
o k 
bye 
o k  bye  don t bring
your queen out too soon   
this is great 
which one s yours 
over there by the steps 
oh  that   
that one s mine 
all right  yeah 
what 
looks like they re
friends already 
uh  what s his rating 
15 
15 hundred 
yeah 
how old is he 
7 
7 
well  i doubt that they ll
be playing each other then 
morgan s not rated 1 000 yet 
oh 
15 hundred 
questions during
the course of the game 
raise your hand 
he was cheating  he tried to
castle when i had him checked 
o k   i want to remind you
to conduct yourselves
like adults 
i don t want any trouble 
and you know exactly
what i m talking about 
if you re going
to watch the game 
do so from behind the player 
no throat noises 
no comments 
no eye contact 
nobody cares if you re
guilty or not 
if you all behave yourselves 
i think we ll all have
a very good time 
i m not kidding 
listen  my son can t
play with these pieces 
my daughter needs her own clock 
oh  this is unfair 
start   
your clocks 
i did not pull on my ear 
you pulled on your ear 
i did not 
i scratched my ear 
you re a liar 
break it up 
he s out of his mind 
break it up 
i don t care 
take your hands off me 
you re the one
who s trying to   
we just came to have fun 
i don t understand this 
hey 
hey  what    hey 
see  you can call me
the man of many signals 
many signals 
knock it off  for christ s sake 
i don t want to  knock it
off  for christ s sake  
i m a man of many signals 
yeah  i pull
my nose  my elbow   
and whatever else
i want to pull 
you play the game fair 
that s the way it s played 
so    you see me
pulling my ear 
it s not an itch 
you might think it s an
itch  but it s not an itch 
so watch for the subtleness 
you re lucky you don t get
nervous at these things 
hi 
if your son wins his game
and my son wins his 
they ll be playing each
other in the final round 
i can hardly wait 
hey  it s only a game 
i m going to get myself
a tuna fish sandwich 
can i get you a sandwich 
no  that s   
i m going to get you
a tuna fish sandwich 
queen takes pawn 
josh is in trouble 
he s down another pawn 
don t you believe it 
your boy ll pull it out 
no  he s down too much material 
he s going to lose 
knight takes rook 
petey just hung his rook 
he probably sacrificed
it for position 
he s probably still
got the advantage 
it s over 
wha    d   
who won 
in school 
before he dropped out 
bobby studied chess books
while his teachers
taught other things 
when they told him
to put his books away 
or took them away 
he studied in his head 
when a science report
came back to him once
with the words
 not satisfactory 
written across the top 
he wrote under it
just as big 
 tough  
he was 14
and had already beaten the strongest
adult players in the country
to become the youngest
u s  champion ever 
welch is on the mound 
now casey signals 
he winds up   
the pitch 
bye  mom 
have fun 
we ll call you
when we get there 
bye 
there s your dad 
yes 
look at this  look at this 
see this 
none of you patzers
ever won anything like this 
shut up  we re trying
to play a game 
he gets it 
throws to first   
gets him 
and one out 
thanks 
that s a high 15
instead of a high 5 
i think we got it
in the bag now 
come on  bruce 
all right 
the windup and   
the pitch 
great 
he s out 
oop 
and in first place   
josh waitzkin 
mr  waitzkin 
oh  hi 
how you doing 
hi  i m so glad
you could make it 
me  too  this
is really great 
isn t it  the children
worked very hard on it 
i understand from josh you
just got back from washington 
i think that s super 
yeah  it was great 
he told us all about the hotel 
he was impressed with that 
you ve been taking him
a lot of places lately 
i think it s good 
it s important
for kids to travel 
it s a great education 
they start to realize
there s more to the world
than washington square 
yes  he s been talking a lot
about washington square  too 
uh   
uh  let s see   
we ve heard about hotels
in  uh  syracuse  philadelphia 
boston   
washington now 
that seems to be
all he can remember 
not the white house
or the capitol building
or the lincoln memorial 
and you re wondering
why that is 
it s because i m a rotten father 
you re right 
i drag him all over the country
for my own selfish reasons 
fred  is josh falling
behind in his schoolwork 
he is  but i m more concerned
about other things   
like his friendships 
there s a problem there 
possibly 
well  is there or isn t there 
mr  waitzkin   
i m sure he s very good
at this chess thing 
but that isn t
really the issue   
chess thing 
i m sorry 
chess thing 
i m sure he s good at
it  but i m worried 
if i can make an analogy 
if it was like  say   
oh  i don t know   
um  cards 
pinochle 
pinochle 
for instance 
pinochle 
fred   
bonnie   
she s comparing chess
to pinochle 
what am i supposed
to say to that 
she s trying to make a point 
maybe we should listen 
vinnie thinks he s spending
too much time at it  too 
vinnie  vinnie s
a drug addict 
i m supposed to listen
to his opinion  too 
i m sorry  but your analogy
is a very bad one 
if you want to make a comparison
to something  have it make sense 
compare it to math
or music or art 
because otherwise it
belittles him and it and me 
i don t mean to belittle you 
oh  but you are  even the
way you re looking at me 
mr  waitzkin 
i think perhaps 
i ll tell you how good he is 
he s better at this
than i ve ever been
at anything in my life 
he s better at this than
you ll ever be at anything 
my son has a gift 
he has a gift  and once
you acknowledge that 
then maybe
we ll have something
to talk about 
josh 
chess is what it s called 
not the  chess thing  
chess 
what s its number 
it doesn t have a number 
it s a private school 
only the public schools
have numbers 
it s called dalton 
you can still see your
friends whenever you want 
after school or on weekends 
when there s not a tournament 
your friend morgan goes there 
morgan goes there 
oh  yeah 
he wouldn t go there unless
it was great  right 
ah  it s the best 
they  um 
even have a chess class 
what s the yard like 
the yard 
do they have good stuff
to climb on 
i m sure it does 
um  i haven t seen it  but
i m sure it s great 
so  um   
what do you think 
if you say it s great 
then it has to be 
it s a mistake 
what was wrong
with the old school 
i don t know 
i guess it was no good 
and the new one s better 
they have a chess class 
they have a chess class 
are you o k  
what the hell s
going on over there 
bobby fischer 
young fischer 
check 
check 
trick or treat 
why is black better

white has more pawn islands 
which is white s weakest island 
the isolated pawn 
only the king can save it 
that s right 
that s very good

have given him to me 
does nothing but play chess 
no other interests 
  he goes to school 
  oh  no 
well  that s great  you
should be proud of yourself 
i am 
you should watch him play 
he reminds me of you 
only he never gives up 
josh 
it s not a part
of his character 
he s not going to
disappoint his teacher 
 and when he knew that the
cottage was entirely destroyed 
 the monster screamed once
more in agony and hatred
and retreated backward to
seek refuge in the woods  
wow  then it gets
really scary
because they chase him
and light torches and stuff 
so we ll get to that tomorrow 
good night  tiger 
good night 
dad   
maybe we shouldn t go
to the state finals 
what are you talking about 
of course we re going 
that s what we ve worked
so hard for 
if i win   
everybody will say 
 well  of course he won 
he s a top ranked player 
but if i lose   
you won t lose  josh 
what if i do 
you won t 
i m afraid i might 
josh    they re afraid 
they re terrified of you 
now you get some sleep 
maybe it s better
not to be the best 
then you can lose 
and it s o k 
it took people a while
to realize he was really gone 
he disappeared before 
once for 18 months
before the crushing defeat
of petrosian in belgrade 
but when he didn t show up
in manila in  75
to defend his title 
they took it away from him and
gave it back to the russians 
o k   let s go 
i m standing here
with fred waitzkin 
i hope i pronounced that right 
fred  what s it like
being a chess parent 
in my case  the hardest part
is keeping track
of my son s toy cars 
making sure he eats something
other than french fries   
hi 
hi 
your son s the odds on
favorite  i understand 
he s rated number one
in his division  yes 
so every other parent
in this room hates you 
i m just kidding  fred 
thank you  sir  he can
go to his table now 
next  please 
oh  my god 
that was quick 
i hate this part 
what 
no 
seven moves 
seven 
how is it possible
to lose in seven moves 
maybe i don t really have it 
well  you know that s not true 
that s not why this happened 
i don t understand
why this happened 
why did this happen 
well  think 
take your time 
take more time than you took losing
to that patzer and figure it out 
did you fall for a trap 
did you
bring your queen out early
even though bruce warned you
time and again about that 
maybe he s just better than me 
no  don t tell me that kid s
better than you because he isn t 
why are you standing
so far away from me 
come here 
it s o k 
it s o k 
i m sorry 
for all his natural ability 
bobby fischer studied harder
than any player who ever lived 
he woke up thinking about chess 
he went to bed thinking about it 
he dreamt about it 
why  isn t it enough
to be a natural 
if you don t care about
winning  it s enough 
but he wanted to win 
he had to be champion 
and in order to do that 
he had to work 
which is what we re going to do 
o k 
all right 
promise you won t
argue moves with me 
no matter how much
you think you re right 
i promise 
everything i tell you
imagine is coming from him
because i know
every game he ever played 
so  in effect  he s going to be
teaching you  and you ll become him 
promise 
all right 
some new rules 
no more speed chess 
i know you like it 
i know it s fun 
but it s no good 
it ruined arbakov 
and it ll ruin you 
and no more games
in washington square 
they re patzers  and they re
teaching you all the wrong things 
they re not patzers 
they re losers 
and unless you want to
end up just like them 
you ll stay away 
they re not patzers 
i mean it 
now   
which one is you 
what do you mean 
i mean  which one is you 
none of them 
they re just pieces 
this is you 
so what s your best move 
rook to d1 
what about taking on e5 
what about it 
you didn t consider it  you re
still not considering it 
sit up 
i m right  rook to
d1 is the best move 
that s not the point 
you didn t study the board 
you re moving before i know the answers 
give me your book 
why 
give me your book 
why 
you just lost some
master class points  tiger 
i can t lose points 
no  you just lost some
more for arguing with me 
fine  tim  it s not enough 
what s happening 
what s happening 
i hear a whole lot of talk
and don t get much for it 
ooh  it hurts 
damn 
damn 
do you know what the
word contempt means 
it s to think of others
as being beneath you 
to be unworthy of being in
the same room with you 
i don t feel that 
well  you better start 
because if you don t think it s a
part of winning  you re wrong 
you have to have contempt
for your opponents 
you have to hate them 
but i don t 
they hate you 
they hate you  josh 
i don t hate them 
bobby fischer held the
world in contempt 
i m not him 
you re telling me 
in the primary division 
in first place with a
perfect six out of six 
jonathan poe 
let s give a round of applause
for all the winners 
it s white s move 
can we expect it any time soon 
how many points is it worth 
to make the opening move 
yes 
forget the points 
how much is it worth if i do it 
do it for its own sake 
i want to know how close i am
to getting the certificate 
forget that 
i want to know 
i don t know 
what do you mean 
i don t care 
i don t understand 
it s white s move 
i want the certificate 
you want the certificate 
you have to have
the certificate 
you won t move until you
get the certificate 
you win 
here s your certificate 
fill it out 
doesn t mean anything 
it s a piece of paper 
it s a xerox of a piece of paper 
do you want another one 
do you want 10 
you want 20 
30 
i ve got a briefcase full of them 
they mean nothing 
they mean nothing 
get out of my house 
to put a child in a position
to care about winning
and not to prepare him is wrong 
  get out of my house 
look  i know you don t want
to admit it  but he s right 
i mean  you wouldn t sign
your kid up for little league
and then not get him a glove 
you equip him 
it s over 
bonnie  he s in a slump 
this is a slump 
it happens 
when you get into a slump 
you get out of it eventually 
you don t give up 
this is like baseball to you 
if you re afraid to lose  you lose 
if you loose  you get more afraid 
he s not afraid of losing 
he s afraid of losing your love 
how many ballplayers grow up
afraid of losing
their father s love
every time they come
up to the plate 
all of them 
he knows you disapprove of him 
he knows you think he s weak 
but he s not weak 
he s decent 
and if you or bruce 
or anyone else
tries to beat that out of him 
i swear to god
i ll take him away 
when did you start to get
serious about chess 
uh  i got serious  oh   
hmm  oh  well  i was always
pretty serious about it 
you know  when i was maybe 7 
people say they ve received
letters from him over the years 
but never show them 
they say he lost his nerve 
and he ll never play again 
they say he lost his mind
and roams the streets
of los angeles
hiding out under assumed names 
check 
check 
some people say   
he s dead 
i think he s lying low
and getting stronger 
waiting for just the right
moment to come back
and reclaim his crown 
hey  josh 
shh 
what happened to your room 
i cleaned it 
hey  you know 
you don t have to
do this anymore 
you could give it up  and
that s all right with me 
in fact   
i want you to 
how can i do that 
what do you mean 
you just do it 
but i have to win 
no  that s what i m
saying  you don t 
but you told me i did 
well  i m telling you

used to from the gut 
get your pawns rolling
on the queen s side 
put it out 
josh is playing 
he taught you how not to
lose  not how to win 
you got to risk losing  you
got to risk everything 
you got to go
to the edge of defeat 
  but

never play the board 
always the man 
you got to play the man
playing the board  play me

how would you know that

i    i don t know 
but what i do know is that
he likes playing again
for the first time
in a long time 
i know you think
you re doing what s best 
but you re setting him up for the
biggest disappointment of his life 
that other kid isn t spending
his afternoons riding bikes
and playing pac man 
i can guarantee you that 
i m doing the only thing
i know how to do for josh 
i don t know what else to do 
don t let him
go down there to lose 
that s what you can do for him 
you re his father 
forbid it 
i can t do that 
fred   
he s going to killed 
there s not going to be
much left of him 
you have no idea what a fall
like this can do to you 
i think i do 
you know what 
you should come down with us 
it would mean a lot to
him to have you there 
that i can t do 
there you go 
thank you 
thanks 
come on  katya 
o k  that s not bad 
but that s not right  o k

fools rush in

hi  morgan 
josh  where you been 
fishing

no chess boards  no chess books 
i wasn t allowed to talk about
chess for two whole weeks 
just fish 
whoa 
it was my dad s idea 
hey  kalev 
how s it going 
fishing 
sure 
the 200 young players finding
their seats behind me
represent some
of the strongest chess minds
of any age in the country 
traveling from as far away
as alaska and hawaii 
they ve come here to compete
against each other
over the course of the next
two long  grueling days 
to become champion 
one must win all seven games 
that s right 
this is donovan dennan 
director of the national
scholastic championship 
tell me  is the next bobby
fischer somewhere in this room 
hi  mom

i ll see you in a little while 
bye 
bye 
josh   
good luck 
some of you may be unfamiliar
with sudden death rules 
if you re writing moves down
while a player gets down
to where there s less
than five minutes left 
it s no longer
your responsibility to   
hi 
hi 
is that clear 
good luck 
one more thing 
if you have a problem   
morgan 
if you have a problem 
you don t have to discuss it
with your opponent 
all these people
with purple hats around here 
they ll be wandering around 
just put your hand up 
and they ll straighten it up 
o k  just hold up your hand 
and they ll see it 
don t argue with your opponent 
that s ridiculous 
o k  good luck 
start your clocks 
can i come in 
how are you feeling 
scared 
i can t beat him 
you might be right 
i m not supposed to say that 
but you d know i was lying
if i said anything else 
i have something for you 
it says 
 this is to certify that
josh waitzkin  on this day 
 has in the eyes
of his teacher   
attained the rank
of grandmaster  
i have never been so proud
of anyone in my life 
i m honored to call myself
your teacher 
i m so scared 
i know 
will you stay until it s over 
will i stay 
i wouldn t miss it
for the world 
it s unsettling  isn t it 
when you realize there are only so
many things you can teach a child 
and finally   
they are who they are 
good luck 
good luck 
start your clocks 
what s happening  why
isn t he moving 
letting his time run 
trying to psych josh out 
don t do it  josh 
don t even think about it 
bring her out 
keep her back 
bring her out  josh 
oh  jesus

he s setting him up 
josh is setting him up now 
i taught him that 
check

trick or treat 
that was a mistake 
what was a mistake 
who made a mistake 
look deep  josh 
it s there 
it s 12 moves away  but it s there 
you ve got him 
take his pawn with your pawn 
g takes f6 forking
his bishop and rook 
don t take back
with your bishop 
you ll need that to guard e7 
he ll take back 
either with his bishop
or his knight 
when he does  this is the hard
part  sacrifice your rook 
capture him on f6
and get him to check 
king has to take your rook 
he takes f6 
give him the knight to check e7 
forking his king and his rook 
he ll move to safety 
king f5 
take his rook with your knight 
he ll take back with his king 
and you ve got him 
don t move until you see it 
i can t see it 
don t move until you see it 
i can t see it 
don t move until you see it 
i m sorry  dad
