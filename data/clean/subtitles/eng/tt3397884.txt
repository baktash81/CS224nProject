jesus christ
reg step out its okay
vickers i need bolt cutters
vickers
pd found something
relax
relax
such a heavy body count
this close to phoenix
is without a doubt a major escalation
for the cartels
there will be pressure in washington
to explain how such a dramatic outrage
could happen so deep inside
the american heartland
we may be talking about the victims
of a turf war
or maybe some illegal immigrants
who are tied to a ransom
but it will be some weeks
before we have a clearer picture
on who the victims
whats goin on
i have no idea
shes been leading
our kidnap response team for three years
put her through the grinder since
she got here and she hasnt blinked
shes in the front line
nobodys gonna be happier than kate
to see these guys go down
so shes a thumper
today was her fifth ois
5and0 not bad for a rookie
she never worked cases
been kicking doors since day one
i like her already what about the partner

the loss of two officers notwithstanding
yes sir
how familiar are you
with manuel diazs operation
his company sun oasis
has 80 or so foreclosure properties
he has other legitimate businesses
but hes rumored to be linked
with one of the mexican cartels
manuel diaz works
for the sonora cartel
hes most likely their senior member
in the united states
what do you know about his brother
i wasnt aware he had one
guillermo his brothers name is guillermo
do you know anything about his cousin
i didnt know he had one of those either
none of that is in his file
his cousin is fausto alarcon

just rotated back from afghanistan
wow wheres everybody linking up
aic
good good good
mexican federal police
will meet you at the border
and proceed with you to the courthouse
located here
this is a highlevel target
the most likely spots for an attempt
will be at the exchange
and at the border crossing on the return
the marshals will enter
kevin keith you wanna stand up
now the marshals response team
is in laredo
love texans
so our friends from delta
have volunteered to come along
and will escort the marshals
on the exchange
and heres the man of the hour

loan us a couple pop guns
all right this is turning
into an allstar affair

in case your hands get shaky
i know i could always
count on you keith
all right well gear you up
as soon as were done here
now matt you can be the tip of the spear
and we dont have to rob a guy from delta
now be careful on the turnaround
if the federales a shooter
its gonna happen on the turnaround
deltas team one will be the lead vehicle
we can divide team two between the
carry car and the trail vehicle that okay
good now delta
if you can identify yourselves
so everyone knows who to hide behind
if shit hits the fan
the most likely spot for a hit will be
at the border crossing on the return
anywhere along the way anyone not
in this room is a potential shooter
the op isnt over until we get back here
okay
be alert be vigilant
and be aware lets go
what
hey i thought you were in prison

juárez
you know
1900s president taft
went to visit president diaz
took 4000 men with him
and it almost was called off
some guy had a pistol
was gonna walk right up to taft
and just blow his brains out
but it was avoided 4000 troops
think he felt safe
welcome to juárez
its brilliant what they do
when they mutilate a body like that
they make people think
they must have been involved
they must have deserved such a death
cause they did something
oh its brilliant what they do
you hear that
those arent firecrackers
mexicans are adjusting our route
theres activity ahead
we need to go around
everyone hold on

guillermo didnt have any other options
we send him back across the border
hes a dead man
now he gets to spend the next 30 years
in an american prison
in relative safety
just tell us the truth man
we are gonna make enough noise
that manuel diaz is called back
to mexico to see his boss
thats the truth
and then
and then we know where his boss is
his name is fausto alarcon el verdugo
every day across that border
people are kidnapped or killed
by his hand or with his blessing
to find him would be like
discovering a vaccine
you understand the value of that
all right were good
just dont keep us in the dark
great
you afraid of the dark
hey
its been a humdinger of a day
go home get some rest
well find our own ride

oh god dont look at me like that
i dont want your pity
how was seeing evan the other day
i dont know
miss him
ask me something else
you know
i used to see guys like matt in iraq
gotta be careful around these people
cias not supposed to
work this side of the fence
hes a dod advisor
you really believe that
you need somebody watching your six
cause i promise you they arent
you know
were not even scratching the surface
doing what were doing
and they are
well you sure picked
the motherfuckers to show us
whats the password
moron
los caballeros can you cross there
you can
but the coyotes there are crooked
no women can cross there
this is our spot
no way no no
this is drug land
the only people who cross there
are mules and pollos
it keeps border patrol away
never cross where there are tunnels
you know this area
for years it was the best place to cross
here you can walk easily to highway 86
there is water and shade
are you getting this
can you mark the trail to the tunnel
they hide the entrance behind an old car
look right here
yes
thats our way across
so guillermo was tellin the truth
its gonna be a good day
hey kate
got any friends at phoenix swat
yeah we use them
in breaches all the time
good cause were gonna need their help
what for
we are gonna fuck with
manuel diazs wallet
this is our smurf guys
blonde hair white purse
you know the heimlich
oh yeah
she tries to eat that deposit receipt
you heimlich it right out of her hear me
copy that
there she goes
all right go get em tiger
take em
get down
hold still hold still
you want bank computers for evidence
no no just the money
but freeze all his accounts everything
even if his dog opened an account
i want you to freeze it
what you got
got a mobile money launderer
pack it up
come on come on
you coming
no dont go in the bank
this is something
we can actually build a case on
dont go in the bank kate
there you go and shes goin in the bank
these are all manuel diazs accounts
yeah cash deposits made daily
in 9000 increments
so it doesnt have to be reported
thats right
and you can seize those
i already have and ill go through
these wire transfer numbers and
freeze all these accounts as well
here you go
oh damn thats smart
what
this is a bank line of credit
see you make payments
over what you owe
and it doesnt show up as cash
it shows up as a negative loan balance
its never reported to anyone irs dea
this money is invisible
how much does he have
take a look
oh my god
they just seized 17 million
its a bogus bust kate
what
you cant prosecute it
no one controls who deposits
money in an account
an attorney will have that money back
in a few months
but a lot of heads will roll before that
but we can arrest manuel for now
we can get him off the street
we gotta get manuel called back to mexico
thats the objective
we have no jurisdiction in mexico
we have nothing
we need to do something now
cant arrest him
what
when
wait a minute
9000 is deposited into this account
every day in cash
for five years
its not illegal
its suspect but it isnt illegal
i think the irs might think its illegal
what do you want kate
what would you like done here
i want to follow
some semblance of procedure
thats what i want
to build a prosecutable case
we prosecuted more felony drug cases
in this region last year
than in the two previous years combined
are you feeling that on the street
you getting the vibe that were winning
no
do you
no sir i dont
advisors like matt come in
they stir the pot
they cause the criminals
to react and make mistakes
thats how we build cases
against the individuals
that actually make a
difference in this fight
its when theyre nervous
when they stop trusting their crews
when they move their money
these are all opportunities to strike
and thats the purpose of people like matt
kate this isnt something
that i dreamed up myself
i dont have the authority to hire advisors
or authorize joint agency missions
or fly agents from air force bases
are you understanding me
these decisions are made far from here
by officials elected to office
not appointed to them
so if your fear is operating out of bounds
i am telling you you are not
the boundarys been moved
are we clear
yes sir
i need a fucking drink
where you wanna go
anywhere
im gonna go get a table
i guess its on me
