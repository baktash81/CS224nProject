relax 
relax 
such a heavy body count
this close to phoenix
is without a doubt a major escalation
for the cartels 
there will be pressure in washington
to explain how such a dramatic outrage
could happen so deep inside
the american heartland 
we may be talking about the victims
of a turf war
or maybe some illegal immigrants
who are tied to a ransom 
but it will be some weeks
before we have a clearer picture
on who the victims   
what s goin  on 
i have no idea 
she s been leading
our kidnap response team for three years 
put her through the grinder since
she got here  and she hasn t blinked 
she s in the front line 
nobody s gonna be happier than kate
to see these guys go down 
so she s a thumper 
today was her fifth o i s 
5 and 0  not bad for a rookie 
she never worked cases 
been kicking doors since day one 
i like her already  what about the partner

the loss of two officers notwithstanding 
yes  sir 
how familiar are you
with manuel diaz s operation 
his company  sun oasis 
has 80 or so foreclosure properties 
he has other legitimate businesses 
but he s rumored to be linked
with one of the mexican cartels 
manuel diaz works
for the sonora cartel 
he s most likely their senior member
in the united states 
what do you know about his brother 
i wasn t aware he had one 
guillermo  his brother s name is guillermo 
do you know anything about his cousin 
i didn t know he had one of those either 
none of that is in his file 
his cousin is fausto alarcon 
i don t know who that is 
no one does  he s off the grid

mexican federal police
will meet you at the border
and proceed with you to the courthouse 
located here 
this is a high level target 
the most likely spots for an attempt
will be at the exchange
and at the border crossing on the return 
the marshals will enter   
kevin  keith  you wanna stand up 
now  the marshals  response team
is in laredo   
love texans 
so our friends from delta

and we don t have to rob a guy from delta 
now  be careful on the turnaround 
if the federale s a shooter 
it s gonna happen on the turnaround 
delta s team one will be the lead vehicle 
we can divide team two between the
carry car and the trail vehicle  that okay 
good  now  delta 
if you can identify yourselves
so everyone knows who to hide behind
if shit hits the fan 
the most likely spot for a hit will be
at the border crossing on the return 
anywhere along the way  anyone not
in this room is a potential shooter 
the op isn t over until we get back here 
okay 
be alert  be vigilant 
and be aware  let s go

and it almost was called off 
some guy had a pistol 
was gonna walk right up to taft
and just blow his brains out 
but it was avoided  4 000 troops 
think he felt safe 
welcome to ju치rez 
it s brilliant what they do 
when they mutilate a body like that

they must have been involved 
they must have deserved such a death
 cause they did something 
oh  it s brilliant what they do

guillermo

near sasabe 
now we re tryin  to find out
what areas near there migrants avoid
so we can find the tunnel 
that better 
and guillermo is   
guillermo  he just told you
where the drug tunnel is 
he just told you 
guillermo didn t have any other options 
we send him back across the border 
he s a dead man 
now he gets to spend the next 30 years
in an american prison 
in relative safety 
just tell us the truth  man 
we are gonna make enough noise
that manuel diaz is called back
to mexico to see his boss 
that s the truth 
and then 
and then we know where his boss is 
his name is fausto alarcon  el verdugo 
every day across that border 
people are kidnapped or killed
by his hand or with his blessing 
to find him would be like
discovering a vaccine 
you understand the value of that 
all right  we re good 
just don t keep us in the dark 
great 
you afraid of the dark 
hey 
it s been a humdinger of a day 
go home  get some rest 
we ll find our own ride 
we ll see you tomorrow 
i just drove a hundred fucking miles 
it s a fucking blessing  trust me 
got you smokin  again 
yeah 
who the fuck s guillermo 
come and eat 
let s get ready for school 
where s dad 
he s working 
when s he back 
don t know 
gotta get you a new bra  woman 
the list of things i need 
i m just saying  you know 
some nice lacy somethin  
it s been a while since someone s
seen me in a bra  except you 
oh  god  don t look at me like that 
i don t want your pity 
how was seeing evan the other day 
i don t know   
  miss him 
  ask me something else 
you know 
i used to see guys like matt in iraq 
gotta be careful around these people 
cia s not supposed to
work this side of the fence 
he s a dod advisor 
you really believe that 
you need somebody watching your six 
 cause i promise you they aren t 
you know 
we re not even scratching the surface
doing what we re doing 
and they are 
well  you sure picked
the motherfuckers to show us 
what s the password 
moron 
los caballeros  can you cross there 
you can 
but the coyotes there are crooked 
no women can cross there 
this is our spot 
no way  no  no 
this is drug land 
the only people who cross there
are mules and pollos 
it keeps border patrol away 
never cross where there are tunnels 
you know this area 
for years it was the best place to cross 
here you can walk easily to highway 86 
there is water and shade 
are you getting this 
can you mark the trail to the tunnel 
they hide the entrance behind an old car 
look  right here 
yes 
that s our way across 
so guillermo was tellin  the truth 
it s gonna be a good day 
hey  kate 
got any friends at phoenix swat 
yeah  we use them
in breaches all the time 
good   cause we re gonna need their help 
what for 
we are gonna fuck with
manuel diaz s wallet 
this is our smurf  guys 
blonde hair  white purse 
  you know the heimlich 
  oh  yeah 
she tries to eat that deposit receipt 
you heimlich it right out of her  hear me 
copy that 
there she goes 
all right  go get  em  tiger 
take  em 
get down 
hold still  hold still 
you want bank computers for evidence 
no  no  just the money 
but freeze all his accounts  everything 
even if his dog opened an account 
i want you to freeze it 
what you got 
got a mobile money launderer 
pack it up 
come on  come on 
you coming 
no  don t go in the bank 
this is something
we can actually build a case on 
don t go in the bank  kate 
there you go  and she s goin  in the bank 
these are all manuel diaz s accounts 
yeah  cash deposits made daily
in  9 000 increments 
  so  it doesn t have to be reported 
  that s right 
and you can seize those 
i already have  and i ll go through
these wire transfer numbers and
freeze all these accounts as well 
here you go 
  oh  damn  that s smart 
  what 
this is a bank line of credit 
see  you make payments
over what you owe
and it doesn t show up as cash 
it shows up as a negative loan balance 
it s never reported to anyone  irs  dea   
this money is invisible 
how much does he have 
take a look 
oh  my god 
they just seized  17 million 
  it s a bogus bust  kate 
  what 
you can t prosecute it 
no one controls who deposits
money in an account 
an attorney will have that money back
in a few months 
but a lot of heads will roll before that 
but we can arrest manuel for now 
we can get him off the street 
we gotta get manuel called back to mexico 
that s the objective 
we have no jurisdiction in mexico 
we have nothing 
we need to do something now 
can t arrest him 
what 
when 
wait a minute 
 9 000 is deposited into this account
every day  in cash 
for five years 
it s not illegal 
it s suspect  but it isn t illegal 
i think the irs might think it s illegal 
what do you want  kate 
what would you like done here 
i want to follow
some semblance of procedure 
that s what i want 
to build a prosecutable case 
we prosecuted more felony drug cases
in this region last year
than in the two previous years combined 
are you feeling that on the street 
you getting the vibe that we re winning 
no 
do you 
no  sir  i don t 
advisors like matt come in 
they stir the pot 
they cause the criminals
to react and make mistakes 
that s how we build cases
against the individuals
that actually make a
difference in this fight 
it s when they re nervous 
when they stop trusting their crews 
when they move their money 
these are all opportunities to strike 
and that s the purpose of people like matt 
kate  this isn t something
that i dreamed up myself 
i don t have the authority to hire advisors
or authorize joint agency missions 
or fly agents from air force bases 
are you understanding me 
these decisions are made far from here
by officials elected to office 
not appointed to them 
so if your fear is operating out of bounds 
i am telling you  you are not 
the boundary s been moved 
are we clear 
yes  sir 
i need a fucking drink

that we could control 
and until somebody finds a way
to convince 20  of the population
to stop snorting and smoking that shit 
order s the best we can hope for 
and what you saw up there
was alejandro working toward
returning that order 
alejandro works for
the fucking colombian cartel 
he works for the competition 
alejandro works for anyone
who will point him toward
the people who made him 
us 
them 
anyone who will turn him loose 
so he can get the person
that cut off his wife s head 
and threw his daughter into a vat of acid
