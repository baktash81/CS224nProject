i like the idea of me doing my job
more than the idea
of someone else doing my job
all right now the immunity language
is as good as we can do
fee structure a number
yeah we need to adjust the overall payment
in order that we can address things
like hazard bumps
ill make a list
but also how the installments are spaced
fewer steps
hi
hey
what am i first
yeah victor will be here at 430
and jamies running late
theres always a cash flow problem
this is a short timetable kenneth
should i be nervous
if it will make you feel better
you can get the people
that did the mexico job alex

i didnt realize
your interest extended to personnel

let me turn the volume up a little here
you probably heard me
mention the name paul
paul never not once
well paul hes one of us
but hes freelance
actually i was hoping
you might convince him to come aboard
but thats secondary
paul has managed to get close
to a curious character named studer
and our client
wants to take advantage of this
studer is a french national
residing in ireland
its tricky they want a light footprint
well youve got paul
ive got paul but paul
paul has presented himself
as one half of a power couple
this is your pitch
you want me to be eye candy
ml6 wants me to be eye candy
mallory you are the eye
i dont even know how to play that
i dont wear the dress
make paul wear the dress
well ill ask
look do this and then well go away
afterwards well go to majorca
majorca

we want you to bust kenneths budget

to convince him to meet you
then you can find out
what we both want to know

federal agents en route
u nit three copy
you must have stepped in something
y eah
excuse me deputy cross
deputy cross hi
you were in the corps right
i was a devil dog
listen this might sound a little funny
im a private contractor
on a 1024 operation
and these guys youre about to meet
are not federal agents
i mean follow your protocol and all
but you should really keep your distance
use your radio and your loudspeakers
in order to confirm who these guys arent
really im not joking
you can look me up
a new mexico license for mallory kane
ill confirm the number
you need to sit back
look an innocent civilian will be killed
if you do not listen to me
hey wonder woman you said your piece
now sit back and shut up
jesus are you
get down
just keep your head down
a few more minutes and youre out of this
great great how are you gonna
get out of this may i ask
ill just dump the car
ill find another ride ill catch a bus
great good luck with that
i cant wait till coblenz hears about this
what is that
listen when we split
im gonna give you a number to call
i was supposed to be sleeping in late today
not getting carjacked
scott you still with me
yeah yeah yeah a number
just tell them everything
tell the police too
tell them everything ive told you okay
yeah okay
you did great
youre gonna be fine
yeah okay
this is the trouble
with the private sector kenneth
you got that macho takedown
but wheres the due diligence
wheres the followthrough
now we got ourselves a real twizzler here
and for eight figures
i dont accept excuses
explanations or rationales
now i dont even know
why the hell youre standing here
you should be in her fathers living room
explaining to him
telling him that his daughter
is a fugitive with ties to terrorists
that she killed a man in cold blood
in dublin and killed four cops
you tell him
show him
hell come at you like hes government
make me seem like a monster
play like youre shocked
the guy with the broken arm aaron
get in his head
keep bringing up barcelona
get him arguing with kenneth
kenneth
my fault i shouldve seen that one coming
you did
hold up a sec mal
lets analyze your options
we could leave right now disappear
we could be in buenos aires
this time tomorrow
im not gonna run anymore
mr kane these were taken by the police
theyre pretty graphic
her prints are all over the room
the security video shows them
coming in together and her leaving alone
the guest downstairs
complained about the noise
paul fought back
but she obviously had
the element of surprise in her favor
she choked him out
and she shot him in the head
add that to the four police
and that is five dead in three days
where was she last seen
upstate new york 36 hours ago
was she alone
no she was with a boy 19
she grabbed him at gunpoint
used him as a ride and a shield
so we can add aggravated kidnapping
to the murder charges
no im sorry
this doesnt sound like my daughter
she ever mention the name kenneth
no
really
he runs the company she worked for
they were in a relationship for over a year
and yet she never mentioned him to you
what do you know about her
really at the end of the day
i raised her
and denial is a very effective parenting tool
she was a marine she does something
there must be a reason for it
mr kane she is no longer a marine
she is a murderer
she is a public threat
shes on a killing spree
now you are the on ly person
that she can trust
youre gonna help bring her in
before she kills again
without you she wont survive this
i heard from her
ten days ago
she texted me
said she was going to barcelona
what did she say exactly
going to barcelona call you after
six words thats it
well it was enough for me
and she didnt mention dublin
she didnt say anything about this
no
who was he
he was an agent with british intelligence
now whether this was a murderforhire
or a crime of passion we dont know
well she would never kill someone
for money
there must be an explanation
didnt this all start after barcelona
maybe that has something to do
with why shes a fugitive
something must have happened there
aaron
im on it
its overseas prepaid phone
yeah thats gotta be her
wait for the track
go
talk to her
mallory
dad dont say anything
give kenneth the phone
just be careful
mallory i hope youve decided
to turn yourself in
you can tell me right now
why you sold me out
and what youre into with studer
or you can tell me in ten minutes
when i have my hands around your throat
you need to think for a minute mallory
you need to stop pretending
you can achieve a desirable outcome
in this situation
and turn yourself in
do it for the sake of your father
surrender now if you wanna live
im sorry mallory thats not possible
all right kenneth well do it your way
shes
shes here
here where
in the house track says shes in the house
go now you sit down
you knew about this
you knew she was here
no i told you i havent heard from her
since she texted me
kenny
do we need to have a conversation
about barcelona
aaron you were in barcelona
you know what happened
we rescued a man
did we
aaron you need to focus right now
you were in barcelona
im confused
she works for a private company
breaker box get on it lock the doors
what if shes inside
then well pressurecook her
well find her
i dont mean to tell you your job
but isnt there someone
you should be calling agent milgrom
other officers of the law to bring help
we can handle this
go
i got this watch him
did you hear that
yeah
get on it
toms down ied in the breaker box
we need to get to the car
im not sure if thatll help
but she cant outrun a car
she can if its not running
well then lets find out
be my guest go ahead
you should see this
who did that her
yeah probably thats why were here
doesnt make any sense man
aaron lets not discuss this right now
no were gonna talk about it
calm down
dont tell me to calm down
what did you do
i did what i was contracted to do
we were contracted to rescue somebody
it seems to me
you auctioned him off and tried to burn her
thats not what happened
really
no i can explain
then explain it
and try really hard
dont give me a reason
no just go help her
kenneth
hes gone
you better run
im so stupid
cant believe i met you a week ago
eight eight days
we were in barcelona eight days ago
im trying to focus on my breathing
mal
mal
sweetheart
its okay
in the auction business
they have an expression
called the halo effect
you know what that is
its when an object or work of art
is more desirable
because of its prior ownership
very rare when it happens you know
maybe once in a lifetime
gotta catch it when you can
look i got plenty of drama in my own office
you were his contact
no i was his employer
theres a very big difference trust me
theres only one person i trust
your dad yes he okay
hes fine thanks for cleaning up
well i told you you can have kenneth
alone at the house i promised you that
it should at least make me a colleague
if not a friend
and if something happens to you
well then youre screwed
one friends not a lot
it depends on who it is
and the kid who helped me
well fix the ding in his car
okay i will buy him a new car
what is that an incentive
it could be
you gotta admit
that this type of life appeals
to a certain kind of person
you know youre off the grid
you never answer to anybody
always looking over your shoulder
and you got kenneth out there
with all his contacts
makes you pretty vulnerable
where is he
well mallory that is a valuable piece
of information isnt it
we think hes crossed the border
possible sightings in veracruz
but what would be nice to know
is what he gave everything up for
so were back to the government option
pays less taxes are taken out
but you get your good name back
ill let you know
when
when i have him
yes
kenneth
hes not available
im good
just going for a walk
fuck
who did i extract in barcelona
you mean who did you kill in dublin
tides coming in
it was a journalist a dissident
a dissident journalist
a scientist what does it matter
it mattered to someone who
you were excited on the phone
what do you have
a unique alignment of conditions
i know this man jiang
has been a problem for you
leaking information and so forth
restricting your movements
i also know this kane girl
is about to leave her employer
and take all his business with her
which he wont survive
so when i get word that
jiang has been staying
in a safe house in barcelona
i see an opportunity for everyone
to transcend their circumstances
you mean hire the girl to rescue jiang
and i deliver him to you
the story will be that shes gone rogue
sold out on the barcelona job
and murdered a man
for money at russborough
resistance
he wont be in a position to
put a bullet in him
plant the broach on him and then kill her
when you get back to the hotel
selfdefense
of course
im assuming the motive of everyone
involved is strictly professional
paul the motive is money
the motive is always money
what about kenneth
can he guarantee delivery
its a twoforone deal
you take jiang out
kenneth takes the kane girl out
t o close the loop
with no one looking
yeah youre right
she does sound perfect
you only have to look at her
what about the girl
what about her
can she handle herself
im sure youll cope
ive never done a woman before
you shouldnt think of her
as being a woman
no that would be a mistake
whats in this for you
besides my money
a new life
and a new wife
thats everything i know
thats everything i know thats it
