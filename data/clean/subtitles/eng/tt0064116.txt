its too full
of fast men and loose women
begging your pardon maam no
now im too used to
a quiet simple country life
hes timmy
yes
hes timmy
dear god
on the day
on the very day of your wedding
poor little miss
mrs mcbain
but we all we thought
i know it was to be a surprise today
brett mcbain and i were married
a month ago
in new orleans
i am the resurrection and the life
he who believeth in me though
he were dead yet shall he live
whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die amen
mr bennett
whats he doing here
i found this collar
on a nail by the door
you got no way of knowing
but this is as good as a signature
cheyennes hand
but why
dont worry mrs mcbain
well make em tell us
before we hang em
lets get moving
come on
lets go back to flagstone
no sam
you go back
you dont want
to stay out here alone
why not this is my home
you know wobbles
im kinda mad at you
frank wasnt there
he sent three friends
i dont know nothing i swear
i only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it
i dont know why frank wasnt there
i swear to you that i
cos he was at the mcbains
thats not true
cheyenne did that job
everyone knows that we got proof
that was always one
of franks tricks faking evidence
i dont know i swear
i only arranged the meeting i swear
i dont know nothing
whos there
did you make coffee
make it
didnt sleep a wink
a pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night
yeah but i left them
in the middle of the desert
if theyre lucky
theyll be home in three days
ill do it you fetch the coffee
they want to hang me
the big black crows
idiots what the hell
ill kill anything but never a kid
be like killing a priest
a catholic priest that is
yeah the world is full of people
who hate cheyenne
see i am not
the mean bastard people make out
of course if somebody
had a mind to kill me
it fires me up
and a firedup cheyenne
aint a nice thing to see
especially for a lady
but youre too smart to make him mad
so this heres where i was
supposed to do all the killing
yeah
dont seem the place is worth a shit
now if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me
so they can hang this thing
around my neck
i dont like it none
but i can understand it
what i dont understand is why
neither do i
but i see you looked a lot
for the why
yeah
what if there were
a whole heap of whys
round yellow
you know the kind
you rap them on a stone
and they go ding
maybe
by the way
but i didnt find them
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica
hes somebody youd remember
instead of talking he plays
and when hed better play he talks
you know when youve killed four
its easy to make it five
sure youre an expert
madam it seems to me
you cant caught the idea
of course i have
im here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money
if you want to you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself
and even call in your men
well no woman ever died from that
when youre finished all ill need
will be a tub of boiling water
and ill be exactly
what i was before
with just another filthy memory
you make good coffee at least
not bad
tell me was it necessary
that you kill all of them
i only told you to scare them
people scare better
when theyre dying
and can you tell me
what good was your stupid massacre
now a mrs mcbain has turned up
so i didnt expect that
it happens in business
lets say
this is something i didnt plan on
i have no time for surprises frank
you know that
i got on board
in sight of the atlantic
and before my eyes rot
i want to see the blue of the pacific
outside that window
i know where you got on board
i was there too remember
to remove small obstacles
from the track you said
well there were a few
but we traveled a long way
just the same
and fast
even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast
dont play the sick man with me
mr morton
i knew you
when you were just barely limping
i watch that dry rot
rise a little more every day
any normal mand
put a bullet in his brain
but you
you just got a little more hasty
otherwise you aint changed any
id say youve changed frank
you used to take care
of certain things personally
now youre keeping
in the background
youll end up giving orders
its because now i dont want
to leave you alone too much
youre gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you
like a friend
or like a partner
how does it feel
sitting behind that desk frank
its almost like holding a gun
only much more powerful
you see staying with you i
im beginning to think big too
this mcbain business
has given me ideas
im sorry for you frank
youre doing your best
youll never succeed
in becoming like me
why
because there are many things
youll never understand
this is one of them
you see frank
there are many kinds of weapons
and the only one
that can stop that is this
now shall we get back
to our little problem
my weapons might look simple to you
mr morton
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems
pretty soon the widow mcbain
wont be a problem no more
you wake up one morning and say
world i know you
from now on
there are no more surprises
and then you happen to meet
a man like this
who looked like a good man
clear eyes strong hands
and he wants to marry you
which doesnt happen often
and he says hes rich too
which doesnt hurt
so you think
the hell with new orleans
now ill say yes
and go live in the country
i wouldnt mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all
take care of a house do something
what the hell
well god rest your soul
brett mcbain
even if hes going to have a job
pulling you out of the devils grip
still i swear
hed left money around someplace
if you can find it
youre welcome to it
mrs mcbain goes back to civilization
minus a husband
and plus a great future
you deserve better
the last man who told me that
is buried out there
you know jill
you remind me of my mother
she was the biggest whore
in alameida
and the finest woman that ever lived
whoever my father was
for an hour or for a month
he must have been a happy man
what do you want
cheyennes right once youve killed
four its easy to make it five
this isnt the time to leave
give me some water
from the well
i like my water fresh
when you hear a strange sound
drop to the ground
a sound like what
like that
he not only plays he can shoot too
morning mrs mcbain
what brings you to town
good morning
maybe you dont remember
but yesterday at the funeral
i remember very well
is there something i can do for you
yes
see frank
and tell him i know everything
why is everybody hounding me
about this guy frank
i dont know him
ive never heard of him
ive been troubled by myself please leave me alone
tell frank that i want to make a deal with him secretly
you were told
not to come here for any reason
whatever business you have with
frank
keep it far away from here
i know but when i heard that woman
say she knew everything
i thought i should come over here
and tell you about it
you never thought it wasnt a trick
sure but you know
im mighty careful
no one could have followed me
thats the first thing i learned
working for you to listen unseen
and to watch unheard
you should learn
to live as if you didnt exist
youve known me a long time frank
you know you can trust me
wobbles
how can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders
the man
cant even trust his own pants
lets get out of here
lets get out of here
lets get out of here
the end of the line
yeah
get him on board
tie him up
wait frank i didnt
so nobody followed you
no you gotta believe me
so this is the way i can trust you
i can explain
i didnt know that he
i can explain
i didnt know that he
get out
no frank
get out
frank wait
i told you to keep quiet
did logan and jim
take care of the woman
someone took care of them
we found them out at mcbains place
stone dead
and the woman was gone
your friends
have a high mortality rate frank
first three then two
so youre the one
who makes appointments
and youre the one
who doesnt keep em
what do you want
who are you
dave jenkins
dave jenkins is dead a long time ago
calder benson
