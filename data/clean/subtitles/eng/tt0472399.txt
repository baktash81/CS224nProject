designated targets 
some jobs need to look
like accidents 
others must cast suspicion
on someone else 
a select few need to send
a clear message 
pulling a trigger is easy 
the best jobs are the ones nobody
even knows you were there 
liquor fairy paid me
a visit last night 
left me a big old bottle of scotch 
he even sprung for the good stuff 
see you  henry 
why the fuck do i let you drag
me out to this shit hole 
you re a snob  harry 
eleven hundred people come
through here every day 
hard to remember two fellows
passing through 
thank you 
of course  people might
remember them 
yeah 
then that kind of defeats
your purpose 
i don t go anywhere without
them  nowhere 
try to get them shoes that fit 
they look like cartoons 
everything went okay 
it got done 
there s no one better
than you  you know 
that s why they give you those
jobs that could get hairy
because if they were to get hairy 
then you would take care of it 
and that s all they care about 
services rendered  no loose ends 
fait accompli 
you re a goddamn machine 
you see things 
you view people differently than i
do  differently than anybody does 
yeah  but you ve got
a problem  arthur 
you need companionship 
i have you  harry 
oh  then you re in deeper
shit than i thought 
so how s steven 
did i tell you that i got him a
job at a private security firm 
they kicked him out last month 
he beat some guy half to death 
goddamn disappointment 
always has been  always will be 
call him 
me  call him 
for what 
he probably needs to hear from you 
yeah 
let s go  i ll get your money 
come on  dance with me 
come on  please 
you hungry 
sure 
i gotta go 
okay 
you ever gonna tell me your name 
arthur

or brad  hmm 
yeah 
see you  brad 
yeah  i know  man 2  whoo 
yeah 
global engineering 
i m calling about the ad 
there must be a mistake 
one moment  please 
the advertisement was proofed 
the information is accurate 
i want a meeting 
we ll get back to you 
mr  bishop  mr  dean has
agreed to a meeting 
a private jet will pick
you up in one hour
and deliver you to a site
of his choosing 
you ll be allowed 15 minutes 
the jet will then return you 
when we tell you to be home at
10 00  we mean 10  not 11  30 
i don t care  baby  you scared
your mother to death 
you re grounded for two
weeks  just one second 
well  that s not my problem 
all right  look 
ten days and you volunteer two
saturdays at the shelter 
eight days and three saturdays 
done 
where do i get one of those 
you can t  unless you re
a world champion 
just tell him to come
out and fix it  honey 
all right  let s go 
i ve just been out negotiated
by a 16 year old 
let s take a walk 
six months ago  we were commissioned
to undertake
the largest contract we ve
ever attempted 
the target was far more high profile
than we re normally
comfortable with
but the job was just
too rich to pass up 
the target was south african  the
target fled to south africa 
that s where we made our
move  in cape town 
it took six months to set up 
i assigned a team of five operatives
to work in concert on the mission 
all five were killed 
someone knew everything 
you probably knew some of
the men on that team 
i knew this one  sebastian 
you know how this company
works  mr  bishop 
only two partners know the
details of any given job 
two people knew the details here 
me and harry mckenna 
harry sold us out 
we pulled his financials 
take a look at recent
offshore deposits 
there s one there made two weeks
ago for 20 million u s  dollars 
he s gotten old 
he s gotten weak 
he s loaded with debts  his divorce 
his costly  troubled son 
they made him vulnerable 
and for the past 13 years  i have
been fiercely loyal to him 
there s no one i respected more 
but harry mckenna has
poisoned the well 
he needs to be removed 
immediately 
let me talk to him 
look  i appreciate your
connection with harry 
but there s no turning back here 
he has crossed his rubicon 
every day that he s alive puts
this company in danger 
i know we would all prefer
that you handle this 
given your relationship 
you re in the best position to get
this done quickly and discreetly 
and to be honest with you 
i hate the idea of harry
suffering unnecessarily 
we don t wanna go to
an outside source 
but we will if we have to 
excuse me a sec 
jess  negotiations are
closed  i m sorry 
i m in a meeting  okay 
hang on a sec 
forty eight hours or we ll
proceed without you 
hey  squirt 
remember the expression   quit
while you re ahead  
yeah  i mean  roosevelt  to
be truthful  is my hero 
i mean  the way he dealt
with his damn chair 
jasper  pull your trousers
up  will you  please 
pull your trousers up 
you know  the suits don t really
fit you guys very well 
yeah  get
out of the building  harry 
arthur  they re coming
for you tonight 
who  who s coming 
dean 
take whatever you can use
against them and get out 
oh  jesus 
do you have a pair of scissors 
yeah 
go to the elevator
lobby  on my way 
looks like we got a power outage
on the 1 8th floor 
you have 15 seconds
to get to the elevator
before the emergency
power comes on 
there s a keypad  punch
in the building number 
we cut the power off 
service elevators have to work
on a separate power source 
i m in 
press the basement floor 
the elevator will take 18
seconds to get there 
the level is empty and
unused  take the ramp 
it connects to the building
next door  it leads to an
underground parking lot 
shit 
security cameras haven t been
fitted in this building
yet  so they ll be blind 
okay  you should be entering
the parking lot now 
my van s here 
i left it there 
oh  shit 
well  you got me to circumvent
my own security 
nobody sees me leave 
so  what s this 
cape town  right 
yeah  right 
so  what s the story here 
carjacking 
police will find my van somewhere
in some shit hole
section of the city 
stripped and up on blocks 
something like that 
well  a slight editorial revision 
you don t mind  do you 
yeah  i get off a couple of
shots  there s a struggle 
they get my gun  c est la vie 
at least i don t go down
looking like a pussy 
i ve had that for 33 years 
gift from admiral beasley 
sixth fleet

controversial and polarizing
religious figure 
has been pronounced dead 
police are investigating the shooting
that occurred shortly thereafter 
the perpetrators have
not been found 
attention
all passengers 
please keep all of your belongings
with you at all times

the men on that team 
taxi 
terminal d 
next bus  down the street

what do you want 
i wanna know what you re
doing alive 
last time i saw you  you had
a bullet in your head 
what really happened in cape town 
where s the rest of your
team  they re dead 
who paid you  was it harry or dean 
dean paid me a very large amount
of money to kill the others 
told me to fake my
death  disappear 
you know what else he told me 
that harry was getting suspicious
about a blown operation 
he was about to blow the whistle
and had to be taken care of 
they knew just the man for the job 
someone who could get to him 
it s not the fact that
you killed him  is it 
it s that they played you so easily 
that s what bothers you 
am i right 
well  not so good for your side 
those were my two best teams  i
guess i ll have to send more 
save the fuel 
i m coming for you 
when
are you gonna be home 
i m really hungry 
where are you 
i m in the living room 
sit down on the couch  okay

you re not alone 
there s a gun down the
left side cushion 
it s loaded and the safety s off 
but i m not a lefty 
then you re gonna die 
all right  i ll see you

you ever think about the
people you ve killed 
no 
you ever kill someone you know 
yes 
did it feel any different 
not in the moment 
after 
do you give them some kind of
warning or time to prepare 
kind of time to
make peace 
there s no peace 
so it s best not to let them
know when you re coming 
yes 
i guess it doesn t really
matter anyway 
as long as they re dead
and you re not  right 
hello  finch 
oh  my god  who are you

not interested 
the killer grows a conscience 
i d say that s a breach of professional
ethics  mr  bishop 
harry s death was business 
pure and simple

be so simple now 
you got that right 
because now i m gonna put a price
on your head that s so big 
when you look in the mirror
