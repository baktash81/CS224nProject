at copy cabana  i guess  right 
i see you did a little backpacking 
singapore  bali  indonesia

so you ve been around 
look  none of this has anything to do
with any of the shit

i d have to be the dumbest terrorist
in the history of the world 
so who deposited the 750 
the   
i don t know who deposited the 750 
god maybe  i thought it was a miracle 
i took the money  that was my mistake 
it was an accident

  a woman called me on the phone 
she told me i was going to be arrested 
 a woman   your mom  who 
i don t know  if i knew  i would tell you

ethan shaw  the twin

constitution and 10th  northwest d c 
so truck ran a light 
his brother gets 750 large
and enough hardware
to start his own costco 
five hours after enemy
chatter hits the roof 
i mean  don t you find that
a little coincidental 
what if it s a decoy  to distract us from
something 50 times bigger 
  time for your phone call 
  i thought i didn t get one 
attorney general s office
changed their mind 
ethan shaw had a 183 iq
and yet you had him
as a mid level press flak 
why not it or cyber warfare 
are you suggesting
that he was overqualified 
or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the copy cabana 
no  i m suggesting
that maybe ethan shaw
was a superstar rocket scientist genius
who did go wrong 
and the air force doesn t want
their dirty laundry flapping in the wind 
think what you like  but i need to get in
that room and interrogate him myself 
no 
you don t have a choice  look 
now  neither of us know if either of
those brothers are guilty or innocent

the woman  she called me

who happened to be sitting next to me 
never met the guy in my life 
you know  and then they broke me out
of maximum security custody
in a way i m not even gonna describe
to you because it sounds crazy 
and then they lift us off the face of
the earth and drop us into this shit pile 
she could probably derail a train 
she could probably turn a train
into a talking duck

cranes that keep helping peewee out

triggers the explosion

preferences  and quantifiable
data points that we define
as your personality 
we monitor every social network 
internet logs 
instant and text messages 
known associates 
your friends  companions 
jerry 
e  mails received and sent 
cell phone usage

we know who you are 
    at least 30 minutes late 
sam doesn t care 
we are everywhere 
what do you mean 
why do you keep saying  we  
we the people of the united states   
and so  my fellow americans   
    in order to form a more perfect union 
establish justice 
insure domestic tranquility 
provide for the common defense   
all programmed options   
  programmed options 
      sector searches 
and downloaded points of data
will lead to this central command 
you re a computer 
say hello to our
autonomous reconnaissance
intelligence integration analyst 
we call her aria 
she crunches all our raw intel 
finds patterns 
helps predict the movement
of possible suspects 
right down to behavior  motivation

transferring primary search function
to auxiliary display 
  hello  secretary callister 
  aria 
agent zoe perez  air force osi 
you are to assist her
  in her investigation of ethan shaw 
  yes  mr  secretary 
hello  agent perez  perez  zoe 
middle name  soledad 
official service records indicate
your field reports are very thorough 
if poorly formatted 
please excuse us 
detecting 76  probability
valid threat at los angeles
international airport 
alerting airport authorities
and local police 
those gold spheres send her
infrared data 
any communication intercepts
that she flags a threat 
she analyzes it and tells us
what to pay attention to 
dispatch to terrorism task force 
threat at lax 
we re still beta testing 
but i m pushing to get her online sooner 
mr  secretary  a call for you 
  try to keep up 
  yes  sir 
and find out about shaw 
  major 
  sir 
your profile reveals a pathological
aversion to conformity 
education  career  even voting 
therefore  we conclude
that extreme coercion
is necessary to motivate you 
unlike your brother ethan 
who was self motivated 
how do you know my brother 
he worked in a press office 
his employment there was a cover 
everyone in counterintelligence
operations has one 
ethan was a minuteman  just like me 
army  navy  air force 
every branch of the military had
a minuteman posted here
for a 12 hour shift  just in case she
flags a threat  and monitor hardware 
the night ethan died  he left this post
three minutes early 
now  you don t do that  ever 
you are both required
to complete a task 
  what 
  the protection of our national security 
the constitution allows for civilians
to be recruited
  for the national defense 
  i m done 
i m done  you don t know me 
you don t know my brother 
this is bullshit  i m not serving
in the goddamn national defense 
we know all about him  jerry  and you 
before he was a year old 
ethan walked 
the same task took you
18 months to accomplish 
  how did you get this 
  look at ethan 
they were uploaded
from his home computer 
you want to come over here  sweetie 
come on over here with ethan 
  jerry  birthday cake  let s go 
  ethan had these 
come on  let s blow out the candles 
just for a little bit 
although you re identical in appearance 
you lack the motivation and talent
  that enabled ethan to excel 
      jerry  come on 
  stop it 
  do it like ethan did 
you re different from ethan
in every way  except one 
jerry  let your brother help you  jerry 
you now have 14 minutes to change
your appearance and return to the bus 
we have 14 minutes 
these couriers were hired
by halloway smith

you know   this is how you throw it  
 do it like this    write it like that  
 put your foot here  
even with the small things 
homework  chores  anything like that 
he would handle it
and then say that i did it 
just so my father would notice me 
that was ethan 
he never asked me for anything  ever 
and whatever this is  he was part of it 
i feel like he needs my help to finish it 
i owe him that

27   operation guillotine is in effect 
it was nearly 200 years ago 
in the war of 1812 
that francis scott key
found himself stuck on a truce ship
during the shelling of fort mchenry 
we lost some lives then  too 
but our flag still flew high and proud 
and his admiration became our anthem 
with us tonight is the youth orchestra
of the barrow school
from hyde park  illinois 
sam 
let us stand together 
as they raise our spirits every inch
as high as that flag
to show that our union
is still as strong as ever 
oh  say can you see
by the dawn s early light
what so proudly we hailed
at the twilight s last gleaming 
whose broad stripes and bright stars

there are still no named suspects
in the attack on the blair tunnel
and the attacks in the capitol building 
and there is still no word on the
involvement of jerry damon shaw 
    huge assassination attempt 
transportation networks disrupted 
no suspects identified
or even arrested   
    any idea who is responsible
for what may be
the largest scale
cyber terror attack that s
ever been mounted in the united states 
the house and senate
intelligence committees
meet in closed door session
to discuss ways to prevent this kind of
internal security breach
that left nearly   
the aria project has been
decommissioned
and all those involved
rotated to other assignments 
mr  secretary 
we can t just stop intelligence gathering
just because of what happened here 
no  we can t 
all i know is we made
a great many mistakes 
and good people
paid the ultimate price for them 
and that s a debt we can t ever repay 
but we can honor it 
and we can let their sacrifice remind us
that sometimes
the very measures we put into place
to safeguard our liberty
become threats to liberty itself 
  hey  little guy
