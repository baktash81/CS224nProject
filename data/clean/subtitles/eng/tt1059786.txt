consistent with our intel on alkhoei
sir its just coming up
thirtyseven percent and probable
dont belong in the same sentence
im not taking this to the president
cia and nctc concur it is the target

the stones around the pit
marker for the five pillars of islam
i think its a funeral
for christs sake
counsel how many ways would this
violate the geneva convention
we can invoke hors de combat
theres no independent intel verifying
that this is in fact a funeral
signals got the president
from air force one sir
mr president
we have a 51 identity match
on majid alkhoei
the bad news is theres
some possibility hes at a funeral
you should also be aware
we have an abort recommendation
but the joint chiefs are urging a go
all right whats your recommendation
sir we measure success by
the least amount of collateral damage
at 51 probability the risk is too high
and if it is alkhoei and he walks

constitution and 10th northwest dc
so truck ran a light
his brother gets 750 large
and enough hardware

chatter hits the roof

a little coincidental
what if its a decoy to distract us from
something 50 times bigger
time for your phone call
i thought i didnt get one
attorney generals office
changed their mind
ethan shaw had a 183 iq
and yet you had him
as a midlevel press flak
why not it or cyberwarfare
are you suggesting
that he was overqualified
or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the copy cabana
no im suggesting
that maybe ethan shaw
was a superstar rocket scientist genius
who did go wrong
and the air force doesnt want
their dirty laundry flapping in the wind
think what you like but i need to get in
that room and interrogate him myself
no
you dont have a choice look

of maximum security custody
in a way im not even gonna describe

mr secretary a call for you
try to keep up
yes sir
and find out about shaw
major
sir
your profile reveals a pathological
aversion to conformity
education career even voting
therefore we conclude
that extreme coercion
is necessary to motivate you
unlike your brother ethan
who was selfmotivated
how do you know my brother
he worked in a press office
his employment there was a cover
everyone in counterintelligence
operations has one
ethan was a minuteman just like me
army navy air force
every branch of the military had
a minuteman posted here
for a 12hour shift just in case she
flags a threat and monitor hardware
the night ethan died he left this post
three minutes early
now you dont do that ever
you are both required
to complete a task
what
the protection of our national security
the constitution allows for civilians
to be recruited
for the national defense
im done
im done you dont know me
you dont know my brother
this is bullshit im not serving
in the goddamn national defense
we know all about him jerry and you
before he was a year old
ethan walked
the same task took you
18 months to accomplish

from his home computer
you want to come over here sweetie

the very measures we put into place
to safeguard our liberty
become threats to liberty itself
