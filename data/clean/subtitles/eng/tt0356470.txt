its beautiful
okay it wasnt that long ago
and it wasnt really a faraway kingdom
it was the san fernando valley
it only looked faraway
because you could barely see it
through the smog
but to me growing up
the valley was my kingdom
i was my dads best friend
and he was mine
although being raised by a man put me behind in
the makeup and fashion department
i never felt like i missed out
on anything
i was the luckiest girl in the world
my dad owned the coolest diner in the whole valley
i loved hanging out there
never let the fear of striking out
keep you from playing the game
it was the kind of place where
diet was a fourletter word
and grease came
at no additional charge
at hals everyone felt like family
alright i have drinks for everyone
happy birthday
make a wish princess
what did i need a wish for
i had amazing friends and the coolest dad
but i guess my dad thought i needed
one more thing fiona
i am so sorry
you look beautiful fiona
hey hal
along with my new stepmother came
her twin daughters brianna and gabriella
my outofstepsisters
but as long as my dad was happy so was i
we were going to be one big happy family
cheese
ones enough
unfortunately this was no fairy tale
he took her hand and he kissed it
then he swooped her up onto
his horse
and the beautiful princess and the
handsome prince rode off to his castle
where they lived happily ever after
do fairy tales come true dad
well no but dreams come true
do you have a dream
yeah
my dream is that youll grow up
and go to college
and then maybe someday youll build
your own castle
where do princesses go to college
they go
where the princes go
they go to princeton
but sam you know fairy tales arent
just about finding handsome princes
theyre about fulfilling your dreams
and about standing up for what
you believe in
its just as i always say
never let the fear of striking out
keep you from playing the game
thats right
and just remember if you look carefully
this book contains important things
that you may need to know
later in life
earthquake
my kingdom came crumbling down
the day the northridge earthquake stroke the valley
help help
dont go
ill be right back

going to try to steal
austin away from you
if that was the last thing she did
our stepsister has always been jealous of you
go on
well thats when she invented
this whole cinderella plot
she got ahold of austins
e mail address
and thats when she
started the whole affair
we only wanted to tell you sooner
but she threatened to kill us
shes such a monster
look if you dont believe us
look at the emails
she goes by princeton girl 818
but her real name is sam montgomery
and were brianna and gabriella
so that little boyfriend stealer
thinks she can pull a fast one on me
well well just see about that
austin was really late today and asked me
if youd read this announcement
cinderella

rendezvous with you after the pep rally
nothing like a pep rally
to warm up our prince
carter i talked to him
and not as cinderella
i talked to him as me sam
and he didnt hate me

no not everything not the part
about me being cinderella

austin
the cheerleaders have put together
a little sketch to help get us in the spirit
i love you shelby
thank you
once upon a time there was
a big strong fighting frog
he had a beautiful girlfriend and his dad
owned the biggest pond in all the land
but he still wasnt happy
if only he can find a princess
then she could kiss him
turn him into a prince
and they would run away together
one night after the slimy frog ditches his superhot
seniorpollmostpopular girlfriend
he meets his princess
your highness
alas it turned out that our frog
not only had a secret identity
but also had a secret email relationship
with a pen pal named princeton girl
this isnt good
dear princeton girl i cant wait
till we finally get to meet
youre the only one
who understands the real me
the man who doesnt want
to play usc football
but who wants to be at princeton
with you
what are they talking about
nothing
dear nomad i want you to know
who i am but im scared
im scared that youll reject me
and ive never had a real kiss before
i cant believe theyre reading my emails
lets go
but our princess had a secret too
she wasnt royalty at all but a geek
a loser a servant girl
yeah
any ideas about this
and who may you ask is this imposter
give it up for the pretend princess
diner girl sam montgomery

you gotta love high school
so we won the big game that day
but what i remember most
is that i got my prince
and a really bad cold
after that it was like everything
fell into place
my dad was right the fairy tale book
did contain something important
take this one and take the
two cars in the front
i can pay for those parking tickets

she owns them
exactly i own them
im the county district attorney
have you ever seen this before
ive never seen that before
isnt this your signature
on the witness line
i have never seen my
husbands hidden will before
im afraid youre gonna have to come
downtown with me maam
that hidden will stated that the house
the diner and everything belonged to me
it turned out my stepsisters knew where
fiona had filed my real acceptance letter from princeton
i got it
my dads diner was restored
to its former glory
and my stepmother
made a deal with the da
shes working off her debt
to society at hals
under the watchful eye
of my new partner
and my stepsisters they finally put
their teamwork to good use
austins dad finally came around
and got off his trojan horse
things even cleared up for carter
anything is possible if you just believe
he ended up filming a commercial
and in addition to
landing that commercial
carter also landed the girl
the san fernando valley
was clear and beautiful
the way it only is after a big rainstorm
as for austin and me well
i finally got my cell phone back
