it s beautiful 
okay  it wasn t that long ago 
and it wasn t really a faraway kingdom 
it was the san fernando valley 
it only looked faraway   
   because you could barely see it
through the smog 
but to me  growing up 
the valley was my kingdom 
i was my dad s best friend 
and he was mine 
although being raised by a man put me behind in
the make up and fashion department 
i never felt like i missed out
on anything 
i was the luckiest girl in the world 
my dad owned the coolest diner in the whole valley 
i loved hanging out there 
 never let the fear of striking out
keep you from playing the game 
it was the kind of place where
diet was a four letter word   
   and grease came
at no additional charge 
at hal s  everyone felt like family 
alright  i have drinks for everyone 
happy birthday 
make a wish  princess 
what did i need a wish for 
i had amazing friends and the coolest dad 
but i guess my dad thought i needed
one more thing  fiona 
i am so sorry 
you look beautiful  fiona 
hey  hal 
along with my new stepmother came
her twin daughters  brianna and gabriella 
my out of step sisters 
but as long as my dad was happy  so was i 
we were going to be one big  happy family 
cheese 
one s enough 
unfortunately  this was no fairy tale 
 he took her hand  and he kissed it 
 then he swooped her up onto
his horse 
 and the beautiful princess and the
handsome prince rode off to his castle
 where they lived happily ever after   
do fairy tales come true  dad 
well  no  but dreams come true 
  do you have a dream 
  yeah 
my dream is that you ll grow up
and go to college   
   and then maybe someday you ll build
your own castle 
where do princesses go to college 
they go   
   where the princes go 
they go to princeton 
but  sam  you know  fairy tales aren t
just about finding handsome princes 
they re about fulfilling your dreams   
   and about standing up for what
you believe in 
it s just as i always say 
never let the fear of striking out   
  keep you from playing the game 
  that s right 
and just remember  if you look carefully 
this book contains important things   
   that you may need to know
later in life 
  earthquake 
  my kingdom came crumbling down   
   the day the northridge earthquake stroke the valley 
help  help 
  don t go 
  i ll be right back 
i lost my best friend that day 
and from then on  the only fairy tales
in my life   
   were the ones i read about in books 
since my father didn t leave a will 
my stepmother got everything

  how long are you grounded for 
  well  how long is forever 
  so you re not gonna tell austin 
  come on  carter 
it s not like he s gonna be pinning for me 
trust me  he s forgotten all about cinderella by now

all about you 
dude  why are you going through
all this trouble for one chick 
look  she s not just some chick  all right 
she was real 
  real  like  she still had her old nose 
  no  real

he s looking for you everywhere 
you gotta tell him it was you 
isn t it better to cling
to the dream of what might ve been   
   instead of ruining everything
with reality 
  you can t hide from him forever 
  not forever 
just until graduation  when i leave
this place and never see him again

and then she told us that she was
going to try to steal   
   austin away from you
if that was the last thing she did 
our stepsister has always been jealous of you 
go on 
well  that s when she invented
this whole cinderella plot 
she got ahold of austin s
e  mail address   
   and that s when she
started the whole affair 
we only wanted to tell you sooner 
but she threatened to kill us 
she s such a monster 
look  if you don t believe us 
look at the e mails 
she goes by princeton girl 818 
but her real name is sam montgomery 
and we re brianna and gabriella 
so that little boyfriend stealer
thinks she can pull a fast one on me 
well  we ll just see about that 
austin was really late today and asked me
if you d read this announcement 
cinderella   
   if you re listening  your prince wants to
rendezvous with you after the pep rally 
nothing like a pep rally
to warm up our prince 
carter  i talked to him 
and not as cinderella 
i talked to him as me  sam 
and he didn t hate me

  austin 
  i can t hear you 
  kill the lancers 
  austin 
the cheerleaders have put together
a little sketch to help get us in the spirit 
i love you  shelby 
thank you 
 once upon a time  there was
a big  strong fighting frog 
 he had a beautiful girlfriend and his dad
owned the biggest pond in all the land 
 but he still wasn t happy 
 if only he can find a princess 
then she could kiss him   
    turn him into a prince 
and they would run away together 
 one night  after the slimy frog ditches his super hot
senior poll most popular girlfriend   
    he meets his princess   
your highness 
 alas  it turned out that our frog
not only had a secret identity   
    but also had a secret e mail relationship
with a pen pal named princeton girl   
this isn t good 
dear princeton girl  i can t wait
till we finally get to meet 
you re the only one
who understands the real me 
the man who doesn t want
to play usc football 
but who wants to be at princeton 
with you 
  what are they talking about 
  nothing 
dear nomad  i want you to know
who i am  but i m scared 
i m scared that you ll reject me 
and i ve never had a real kiss before 
  i can t believe they re reading my e mails 
  let s go 
but our princess had a secret too 
she wasn t royalty at all  but a geek 
a loser  a servant girl 
yeah 
any ideas about this 
and who  may you ask  is this imposter 
give it up for the pretend princess 
diner girl  sam montgomery 
diner girl  diner girl 
diner girl  diner girl 
come on 
  sam 
  go away 
but  sam  you ve got a letter
from princeton

i didn t get in 
oh  no 
and you studied so hard 
i can t believe i actually thought
i had a chance 
sam  i m heartbroken 
life can be so unfair 
well  just look at the bright side 
you have a job at the diner
for the rest of your life 
you want a cookie 
they re so moist 
people like her don t belong
in our world  austin 
sam  what are you doing

touchdown  the fighting frogs have won 
they ve done it  they won the game 
oh  my   
you gotta love high school 
so we won the big game that day 
but what i remember most
is that i got my prince 
and a really bad cold 
after that  it was like everything
fell into place 
my dad was right  the fairy tale book
did contain something important 
take this one and take the
two cars in the front 
i can pay for those parking tickets 
actually  i m selling your cars  fiona 
for college tuition money 
what gives you the idea
you can sell our cars 
  she owns them 
  exactly  i own them 
i m the county district attorney 
have you ever seen this before 
i ve never seen that before 
isn t this your signature
on the witness line 
i have never seen my
husband s hidden will before 
i m afraid you re gonna have to come
downtown with me  ma am 
that hidden will stated that the house 
the diner and everything belonged to me 
it turned out my stepsisters knew where
fiona had filed my real acceptance letter from princeton 
i got it 
my dad s diner was restored
to its former glory 
and my stepmother
made a deal with the da 
she s working off her debt
to society at hal s   
   under the watchful eye
of my new partner 
and my stepsisters  they finally put
their teamwork to good use 
austin s dad finally came around
and got off his trojan horse 
things even cleared up for carter 
anything is possible if you just believe 
he ended up filming a commercial 
and in addition to
landing that commercial   
   carter also landed the girl 
the san fernando valley
was clear and beautiful   
   the way it only is after a big rainstorm 
as for austin and me  well 
i finally got my cell phone back
