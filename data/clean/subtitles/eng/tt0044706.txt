i ve never run from anybody before 
  well  i don t understand any of this 
  well  i haven t got time to tell you 
  then don t go back  will 
  i ve got to  that s the whole thing 
  kane s back 
  i don t believe it 
i just seen him 
  how many coffins we got 
  two 
we re going to need at least two more
no matter how you figure 
you d better get busy  fred 
please  will  if you d just tell me
what this is all about 
i sent a man up five years ago
for murder 
he was supposed to hang 
but up north  they commuted it to life 
now he s free 
i don t know how 
anyway  it looks like he s coming back 
  i still don t understand 
  he s a   
well  he was always wild  kind of crazy 
he ll probably make trouble 
but that s no concern of yours 
not anymore 
i m the one who sent him up 
well  that was part of your job 
that s finished now 
they ve got a new marshal 
he won t be here till tomorrow 
seems to me i ve got to stay 
anyway  i m the same man 
with or without this 
well  that isn t so 
i expect he ll come looking for me 
three of his old bunch are waiting
at the depot 
that s exactly why we ought to go 
they ll just come after us  four of them 
and we d be all alone on the prairie 
we ve got an hour 
  what s an hour 
  well  we could   
what s 100 miles  we d never be able
to keep that store  amy 
they d come after us and we d have to
run again as long as we live 
no  we wouldn t 
not if they didn t know where to find us 
oh  will 
will  i m begging you  please let s go 
i can t 
don t try to be a hero 
you don t have to be a hero  not for me 
i m not trying to be a hero 
if you think i like this  you re crazy 
look  amy  this is my town 
i ve got friends here 
i ll swear in a bunch of special deputies
and with a posse behind me 
maybe there won t even be any trouble 
  you know there ll be trouble 
  then it s better to have it here 
i m sorry  honey 
i know how you feel about it 
do you 
of course i do 
i know it s against your religion and all 
  sure i know how you feel 
  but you re doing it just the same 
oh  will  we were married
just a few minutes ago 
we ve got our whole lives ahead of us 
doesn t that mean anything to you 
you know i ve only got an hour
and i ve got lots to do 
stay at the hotel until it s over 
no  i won t be here when it  s over 
you re asking me to wait an hour
to find out if i m going to be
a wife or a widow 
i say it s too long to wait  i won t do it 
amy 
i mean it  if you won t go with me now 
i ll be on that train when it leaves here 
i ve got to stay 
  glad you got here  perce 
  are you 
have you forgotten that i m the man
who passed sentence on frank miller 
you shouldn t have come back  will 
it was stupid 
i figured i had to  i figured i had to stay 
you figured wrong 
i can deputise a posse 
ten  12 guns is all i need 
yeah  my intuition tells me otherwise 
why 
no time for a lesson in civics  my boy 
in the fifth century b c  
the citizens of athens 
having suffered grievously
under a tyrant 
managed to depose and banish him 
however  when he returned
some years later
with an army of mercenaries 
those same citizens
not only opened the gates for him 
but stood by while he executed
members of the legal government 
a similar thing happened
about eight years ago
in a town called indian falls 
i escaped death
only through the intercession of a lady
of somewhat dubious reputation 
and at the cost of a very handsome ring
which once belonged to my mother 
  unfortunately  i have no more rings 
  you re a judge 
i ve been a judge many times
in many towns 
and i hope to live to be a judge again 
i can t tell you what to do 
why must you be so stupid  will 
have you forgotten what he is 
have you forgotten
what he s done to people 
have you forgotten that he s crazy 
don t you remember
when he sat in that chair and said 
 you ll never hang me  i ll come back 
 you ll never hang me  i ll come back 
 i ll kill you  will kane 
i swear it  i ll kill you  
here you are  ma am 
this ll take you to saint louis 
thank you 
maybe you d rather wait
somewheres else 
like at the hotel  maybe 
all right  thank you 
i m awfully sorry
about all this  mrs kane 
but don t you worry  the marshal
will take care of himself all right 
thank you very much 
hey  that wasn t here five years ago 
so what 
nothing  yet 
harvey  don t you think kane
will be looking for you about now 
yeah 
you re really sore at him 
wouldn t you be if you were me 
i suppose  if i were you 
be back in a little while 
  bye  will 
  goodbye 
  think i m letting you down  don t you 
  no 
look  this is just a dirty little village
in the middle of nowhere 
nothing that happens here
is really important  now get out 
there isn t time 
what a waste  good luck 
johnny 
  why aren t you in church 
  why ain t you 
  look  will you do something for me 
  sure 
go find joe henderson 
mart howe and sam fuller
  and tell them i want them here 
  right 
  and then find harv pell 
  don t have to do that  here i am 
  well  where have you been 
  busy 
  you know what s doing 
  sure 
well  come on  we got lots to do 
hold up a second 
this ain t really your job  you know 
well  that s what everybody
keeps telling me 
when i tell you  it means something 
so you can just listen a second 
all right  i m listening 
now  this is the way i see it 
if you d gone  with the new marshal
not due here till tomorrow 
i d be in charge around here  right 
right 
well  tell me this  then 
if i m good enough to hold down the job
when there s trouble 
how come the city fathers
didn t trust me with it permanent 
i don t know 
  don t you 
  no 
that s funny  i figured
you carried a lot of weight 
maybe they didn t ask me 
maybe they figured you were too young 
you think i m too young  too 
you sure act like it sometimes 
come on 
it s very simple  will 
all you gotta do is tell the old boys
when they come
that i m the new marshal 
and tomorrow
they can tell the other fellow
they re sorry  but the job s filled 
  you really mean it  don t you 
  sure 
  well  i can t do it 
  why not 
if you don t know 
it s no use me telling you 
you mean you won t do it 
have it your way 
all right  the truth is you probably
talked against me from the start 
you ve been sore about me and
helen ramírez right along  ain t you 
you and helen ramírez 
it so happens i didn t know 
and it doesn t mean anything to me
one way or the other 
you ought to know that 
yeah  you been washed up
for more than a year 
oh  you go out and get yourself married 
only you can t stand anybody
taking your place there  can you 
  especially me 
  you re a   
i haven t got time  harv 
okay  then let s get down to business 
you want me to stick 
you put the word in for me like i said 
sure  i want you to stick 
but i m not buying it 
it s got to be up to you 
i thought you d grew up by now 
i thought your disposition might have
sweetened up a little down in abilene 
i guess we re both wrong 
what s so funny 
did you really think
you could put that over on kane 
why not 
when are you going to grow up 
i m getting tired of that kind of talk 
  then grow up 
  cut it out 
all right 
why shouldn t he have gone for it 
he needs me 
he ll need me plenty
when frank miller gets here 
that s possible 
should ve had me made marshal
to begin with 
he s just sore  is all 
sore about you and me 
  is he 
  sure 
  you told him 
  sure 
you are a fool 
why  didn t you want him to know 
hey  who did the walking out  anyway 
you or him 
get out  harvey 
  i might just do that 
  then do it 
  you don t mean that 
  try me 
you re gonna talk different
when frank miller gets here 
you might want somebody
around you then
when you try to explain to him
about kane 
  i can take care of myself 
  sure 
only from what i ve heard 
you might not be so pretty
when he gets through with you 
  i won t be back 
  good 
come in 
i just saw harvey  is everything all right 
i think i have to talk with mr weaver 
  you re getting out

thank you 
  you re mrs kane  ain t you 
  yes 
  you re leaving on the noon train

no reason  but it s mighty interesting 
now  me  i wouldn t leave this town
at noon for all the tea in china 
no  sir 
it s going to be quite a sight to see 
  will  i just heard about   
  hello  herb 
you can count on me 
you know that  don t you 
i was figuring i could 
the way you cleaned this town up 
you made it fit
for women and kids to live in 
miller nor nobody else
will ever drag it down again 
i was hoping people would feel that way 
what other way is there 
how many men you got lined up 
none  yet 
well  you better get going  man 
i ll be back in 10 minutes 
loaded and prepared 
where is he 
he s coming up the back way 
there s a careful man 
come in  mr weaver 
  hello  mrs ramírez 
  hello 
  sit down  please 
  thanks 
  is there anything wrong  mrs ramírez 
  no 
then why did you send for me 
i m leaving town  i want to sell the store 
  you want to buy me out 
  well  how much did you want 
 2 000  i think that s fair 
well  it s fair  all right 
but i couldn t raise that much right now 
  how much can you raise 
  oh   1 000 
all right 
you can pay sam the rest in six months
and he ll get it to me  a deal 
yes  ma am 
all right  mr weaver  thank you 
mrs ramírez 
i want to thank you for everything 
i mean  when you first called me in
and put the deal to me about
staking me in the store
and being a silent partner 
you know  my wife thought   
what i really mean to say is that
you ve been real decent to me
right along 
and i want you to know
that i ve been honest with you 
i know you have  mr weaver  goodbye 
goodbye  mrs ramírez 
and good luck to you 
thank you 
  oh  will 
  amy 
you ve changed your mind 
i thought you had changed yours 
no  will  i have my ticket 
i see 
open 19 and clean it up good 
mr miller s very particular 
  is helen ramírez in 
  i guess so 
think you can find it all right 
come in 
what are you looking at 
you think i have changed 
well  what do you want 
you want me to help you 
you want me to ask frank to let you go 
you want me to beg for you 
well  i would not do it 
i would not lift a finger for you 
i came to tell you he was coming 
i should have figured
you d know about it 
i know about it 
i think you ought to get out of town 
i might not be able to    well 
  anything can happen 
  i am not afraid of him 
i know you re not 
but you know how he is 
i know how he is 
maybe he doesn t know 
  he s probably got letters 
  probably 
nothing in life is free 
  i m getting out  i m packing now 
  that s good 
goodbye  helen 
kane  if you re smart 
you will get out  too 
  i can t 
  i know 
  may i ask you something 
  sure 
  who is miss ramírez 
  mrs ramírez 
she used to be a friend
of your husband s a while back 
before that 
she was a friend of frank miller s 
i see  thank you 
  you don t like my husband  do you 
  no 
  why 
  lots of reasons 
one thing  this place was always busy
when frank miller was around 
i m not the only one 
there s plenty people around here
think he s got a comeuppance coming 
you asked me  ma am 
so i m telling you 
you know  i think i ll go get some liquor 
  do you have to have it 
  yeah 
  if you re going after that woman   
  i said i was going for liquor 
  you keep away from kane 
  sure  i can wait 
hiya  harvey 
  hello  harv 
  how are you 
  where s the tin star 
  i turned it in  i quit 
smart move 
i didn t ask you for your opinion 
hey  ben  hey  how are you  ben 
look who s here 
  how are you  ben 
  all right  give me a bottle 
sure thing 
  it s been a long time  ben 
  yeah 
yes  sir  how s frank 
he s not complaining 
well  there ll be a hot time
in the old town tonight  eh  ben 
i wouldn t be surprised 
i ll give you odds  kane s dead five
minutes after frank gets off the train 
  that s not much time 
  that s all frank ll need because i   
you carry a badge and a gun  marshal 
you had no call to do that 
you re right 
no 
i guess you all know why i m here 
i need deputies  i ll take all i can get 
you must be crazy coming in here
to raise a posse 
frank s got friends in this room 
you ought to know that 
some of you were special deputies
when we broke this bunch 
i need you again  now 
things were different then  kane 
you had six steady deputies
to start off with 
every one a top gun 
you ain t got but two now 
you ain t got two 
harv pell here says he just quit  why 
that s between the two of us 
you re asking an awful lot  kane 
considering the kind of man
frank miller is 
all right  we all know what miller s like 
that s why i m here  how about it 
mildred  mildred  he s coming 
now  you do like i told you 
i m not home  don t let him in 
no matter what he says  i m not home 
sam  he s your friend 
don t argue with me 
he ll be here in a second 
he won t believe me 
he ll know i m lying 
you do like i tell you 
  hello  mrs fuller  is sam in 
  no  no  he isn t 
do you know where he is  mrs fuller 
it s important to me that i find him 
i think    he s in church  will 
he s gone to church 
without you 
i m gonna go in a little while 
as soon as i dress 
thank you  mrs fuller  goodbye 
now  what do you want 
do you want me to get killed 
do you want to be a widow 
is that what you want 
no  sam  no 
kane 
  what s the matter  jimmy 
  nothing  i ve been looking for you 
i want a gun  i want to be with you
when that train comes in 
  can you handle a gun 
  sure i can  i used to be good 
  honest 
  but why   
it ain t just getting even 
it s a chance  see  it s what i need 
please  kane  let me get in on this 
all right  jimmy 
i ll call you if i need you 
get yourself a drink meanwhile  huh 
come in  sam 
you re leaving town 
  where are you going 
  i don t know yet 
that doesn t make much sense 
you re afraid  huh  afraid of miller 
no 
sure you are 
or you wouldn t be running 
you got nothing to be worried about
as long as i m around  you know that 
i m not scared of miller 
i ll take him on any time 
i believe you 
then why are you going 
  you cutting out with kane 
  oh  harvey 
  then why are you going 
  what difference does it make 
it s kane  it s kane  i know it s kane 
it isn t kane 
but i m going to tell you something
about you and your friend kane 
you re a good looking boy 
you have big  broad shoulders 
but he is a man 
it takes more than big  broad shoulders
to make a man  harvey 
and you have a long way to go 
you know something 
i don t think you will ever make it 
let me tell you something 
you re not going anywhere 
you re staying here with me 
it s going to be just like it was before 
you want to know why i m leaving 
then listen 
kane will be a dead man in half an hour 
and nobody is going to do
anything about it 
and when he dies  this town dies  too 
i can feel it 
i am all alone in the world 
i have to make a living 
so i m going someplace else  that s all 
and as for you  i don t like anybody
to put his hands on me
unless i want him to 
and i don t like you to anymore 
our text today is from malachi 
chapter four 
 for  behold  the day cometh 
that shall burn as an oven 
 and all the proud  yea 
and all that do wickedly  shall be    
yes 
i m sorry  parson 
i don t want to disturb the services 
you already have 
you don t come
to this church very often  marshal 
and when you got married today 
you didn t see fit to be married here 
what could be so important
to bring you here now 
i need help 
it s true  i haven t been
a church going man 
and maybe that s a bad thing 
and i didn t get married here today
because my wife s a quaker 
but i came here for help
because there are people here 
i m sorry  marshal 
say what you have to say 
maybe some of you already know it 
but if you don t 
it looks like frank miller s
coming back on the noon train 
i need all the special deputies i can get 
well  what are we waiting for  let s go 
hold it a minute  hold it 
before we go
rushing out into something
that ain t gonna be so pleasant 
let s be sure
we know what this is all about 
what i want to know is this 
ain t it true
that kane ain t no longer marshal 
and ain t it true there s personal trouble
between him and miller 
all right  all right  quiet  everybody 
if there s a difference of opinion 
let everybody have a say 
but let s do it like grown up people 
and let s get all the kids
out of the building 
  anything on the train 
  it s on time as far as i know  sir 
i say it don t really matter
if there s anything personal
between miller and the marshal here 
we all know who miller is
and what miller is 
what s more  we re wasting time 
all right  coy 
yes  we all know who miller is 
but we put him away once 
and who saved him from hanging 
the politicians up north 
i say this is their mess 
let them take care of it 
  sawyer 
  well  i say this 
we ve been paying
good money right along
for a marshal and deputies 
now the first time there s any trouble 
we re supposed
to take care of it ourselves 
well  what have we been paying for
all this time 
i say we re not peace officers 
this ain t our job 
i ve been saying right along 
we ought to have more deputies 
if we did 
we wouldn t be facing this thing now 
just a minute  just a minute 
everybody  quiet 
keep it orderly 
you had your hand up  ezra 
i can t believe i ve heard some
of the things that have been said here 
you all ought to be ashamed
of yourselves 
sure  we paid this man and he was
the best marshal this town ever had 
it ain t his trouble  it s ours 
i tell you  if we don t do what s right 
we re gonna have plenty more trouble 
so there ain t but one thing to do now 
and you all know what that is 
go ahead  kibbee 
this whole thing s been handled wrong 
here s those three killers
walking the streets bold as brass 
why didn t you arrest them  marshal 
why didn t you put them in jail
where they ought to be 
then we d only have miller to worry
about instead of the four of them 
i haven t anything to arrest them for 
mr trumbull 
they haven t done anything 
there s no law against them
sitting on a bench at the depot 
i can t listen to any more of this 
what s the matter with you people 
don t you remember
when a decent woman
couldn t walk down the street
in broad daylight 
don t you remember when this wasn t
a fit place to bring up a child 
how can you sit here
and talk and talk and talk like this 
what are we all getting
so excited about 
how do we know
miller s on that train  anyway 
well  we can be pretty sure he s on it 
time s getting short 
parson  you got anything to say 
i don t know  the commandments say 
 thou shalt not kill  
but we hire men to go out
and do it for us 
the right and the wrong
seem pretty clear here 
but if you re asking me to tell my people
to go out and kill
and maybe get themselves killed 
i m sorry  i don t know what to say 
i m sorry 
all right  i ll say this 
what this town owes will kane here 
it can never pay with money 
and don t ever forget it 
he s the best marshal we ever had 
maybe the best marshal we ll ever have 
so if miller comes back here today 
it s our problem  not his 
it s our problem
because this is our town 
we made it with our own hands
out of nothing 
and if we want to keep it decent 
keep it growing 
we ve got to think mighty clear
here today 
and we ve got to have the courage
to do what we think is right 
no matter how hard it is  all right 
there s gonna be fighting
when kane and miller meet 
and somebody s going to get hurt 
that s for sure  now 
people up north
are thinking about this town 
thinking mighty hard  thinking about
sending money down here
to put up stores and to build factories 
it ll mean a lot to this town  an awful lot 
but if they re gonna read about
shooting and killing in the streets 
what are they gonna think then 
i ll tell you  they re gonna think
this is just another wide open town 
and everything we worked for
will be wiped out 
in one day 
this town will be set back five years 
and i don t think we can let that happen 
mind you  you all know
how i feel about this man 
he s a mighty brave man  a good man 
he didn t have to come back here today 
and for his sake and the sake
of this town  i wish he hadn t 
because if he s not here
when miller comes 
my hunch is there won t be any trouble 
not one bit 
tomorrow we ll have a new marshal 
and if we can all agree here
to offer him our services 
i think we can handle anything
that comes along 
now  to me  that makes sense 
to me  that s the only way out of this 
will  i think you better go
while there s still time 
it s better for you  and it s better for us 
thanks 
why don t you put that thing away 
  bang  bang  bang 
  bang  bang  you re dead  kane 
  i sent a kid to find you  didn t he come 
  he was here 
you ve been my friend all my life 
you got me this job 
you made them send for me 
ever since i was a kid 
i wanted to be like you  mart 
you ve been a lawman all your life 
yeah  yeah  all my life 
it s a great life 
you risk your skin catching killers 
and the juries turn them loose so they
can come back and shoot at you again 
if you re honest 
you re poor your whole life 
and in the end  you wind up dying
all alone on some dirty street 
for what 
for nothing  for a tin star 
listen  the judge has left town 
harvey s quit 
and i m having trouble getting deputies 
it figures  it s all happened too sudden 
people got to talk themselves
into law and order
before they do anything about it 
maybe because down deep
they don t care  they just don t care 
what ll i do  mart 
i was hoping you wouldn t come back 
you know why i came back 
well  not to commit suicide 
sometimes   
sometimes prison changes a man 
not him  this is all planned 
that s why they re all here 
get out  will  get out 
will you come down
to that depot with me 
no 
you know how i feel about you 
but i ain t going with you 
seems like a man with busted knuckles
didn t need arthritis  too  don t it 
no  i couldn t do nothing for you 
you d be worried about me 
you d get yourself killed
worrying about me 
it s too one sided like it is 
  so long  mart 
  so long 
it s all for nothing  will 
it s all for nothing 
excuse me 
what is mrs ramírez s room number 
  three 
  thank you 
come in 
  yes 
  mrs ramírez  i m mrs kane 
i know 
  may i come in 
  if you like 
  sit down  mrs kane 
  no  thank you 
  what do you want 
  oh  please   
it s just that i m afraid if i sat down 
i wouldn t be able to get up again 
  why 
  it wasn t easy for me to come here 
why 
look  mrs ramírez 
will and i were married an hour ago 
we were all packed and ready to leave 
and then this thing happened
and he wouldn t go 
i did everything  i pleaded  i threatened 
i just couldn t reach him 
  and now 
  well  that man downstairs  the clerk 
he said things about you and will 
i ve been trying to understand
why he wouldn t go with me 
and now all i can think of
is that it s got to be because of you 
what do you want from me 
let him go  he still has a chance 
let him go 
  i cannot help you 
  please 
he isn t staying for me 
i haven t spoken to him for a year
until today 
  i am leaving on the same train you are 
  then what is it  why is he staying 
if you don t know 
i cannot explain it to you 
well  thank you  anyway 
you ve been very kind 
what kind of woman are you 
how can you leave him like this 
does the sound of guns
frighten you that much 
no  mrs ramírez  i ve heard guns 
my father and my brother
were killed by guns 
they were on the right side 
but that didn t help them any
when the shooting started 
my brother was 19  i watched him die 
that s when i became a quaker 
i don t care who s right or who s wrong 
there s got to be some better way
for people to live 
will knows how i feel about it 
just a minute  are you going
to wait for the train downstairs 
  yes 
  why don t you wait here 
well  i got no use for kane 
but i ll say this  he s got guts 
you re mighty broad minded  joe 
now  you  harv 
i always figured you for guts 
but i never gave you any credit
for brains  till now 
what s that mean 
nothing  only it takes a smart man
to know when to back away 
if i can t pick my company when i drink
in here  i ain t coming in here anymore 
okay  all right 
look at the boy with the tin star 
all right  if that s the way you want it 
all right  boys 
what are you going to have 
put a saddle on him  kane 
go on  saddle him up 
he ll go a long way before he tires 
that s what you were thinking 
wasn t it 
  kind of 
  you scared 
i guess so 
sure  it stands to reason 
come on  let me help you 
seems like all everybody
and his brother wants
is to get me out of town 
well  nobody wants
to see you get killed 
hold it  where are you going 
i don t know  back to the office  i guess 
oh  no  you re getting on that horse
and you re getting out 
what s the matter with you 
you were ready to do it yourself 
you said so 
look  harv 
i thought about it because i was tired 
you think about a lot of things
when you re tired 
  but i can t do it 
  why 
i don t know 
get on that horse  will 
why is it so important to you 
you don t care if i live or die 
come on 
don t shove me  harv 
i m tired of being shoved 
i hate this town  i always hated it 
to be a mexican woman
in a town like this 
i understand 
you do  that s good 
i don t understand you 
no matter what you say 
if kane was my man 
i d never leave him like this 
i d get a gun  i d fight 
why don t you 
he is not my man  he s yours 
you got some clean water i can use 
why  sure  marshal  sure  sure

i volunteered  you know i did 
you didn t have to come to me 
i was ready

this ain t like
what you said it was gonna be 
this is just plain committing suicide 
and for what 
why me  i m no lawman

i got nothing personal against nobody 
i got no stake in this 
i guess not 
there s a limit
