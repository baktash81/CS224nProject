were going to be here till five in the morning
how are you gonna count it
you got a money counter there asshole
yeah yeah yeah
fourteen grand
well its not going to be a even split because
the lions share is going to our hero
consider it unofficial hazard pay
from us to you
enjoy it
cause youre not going to get
it from the department
dont spend it all on one place
you fucking earned that
dont forget that
not bad huh
not bad for a nights work
were gathered here to celebrate a
cop who makes other cops proud
we can all rest a little easier tonight
now that he is on the path to recovery
ladies and gentleman officer avery cross
thank you
thank you thank you for your support
when i was in law school
we used toalways talk about
justice
we had discussions about justice
thats just what they were
discussions
i joined the police force because i
wanted to work alonside the
brave men and women who know some
problems cant be solved by talk
but no one wants to be in the situation
i found myself in a couple of weeks ago
i certainly wish it had turned out differently
im not going to lie
sometimes i havent wished that
maybe it wasnt me that was called
upon that house that day
but thats the job
but i cant think of another line of
work i would rather be in
thank you
how does it feel
im not sure its doing much good
hows the spotlight
im ready for it to end
dont worry
it will
you know the police always put on a big
show when something like this happens because
the hero card is the only
one they have to play
im not really thinking about that dad
im just trying to get back to work
you know if you planned this
it couldnt have turned out any better
youre not going to make it work for
you in the police department
i promise you that
i didnt come here to be lectured dad
you tricked me
you said the pool would be good for my knee
sorry
you know im not as calculated as you are
my life is not a campaign
its much simpler
yeah
though for somebody whos not campaigning
you gave a hell of a speech yesterday
you certainly have my vote
plus that knee is a gold mine
no i mean it
a limp goes a long way in politics
look at roosevelt
i got to go see the chief
i got to go see the chief
where you going brother
i dont know i dont know
is it bad news
is it gonna be bad news
oh jesus christ
dont mess your hair up pretty boy
i got a call today from da killcullen
close the door
the state internal investigation into shooting of
luke glanton has been deemed lawful
congratulations officer
you can put it behind you
get back to police work
the question is can you go back
out on patrol anytime soon
and if you could can you be effective
i dont think that i can
thats okay you know what theres a lot
of jobs to be done around here
that in ways and you know that
in ways that are much more important
than what happens out on the street
im so glad that you said that because chief ive
thought a lot about this and the
i i think i can be best utilized as as lieutenant
in in charge of special investigations
theres a lot of restructuring ah within
the division that ive actually formally
i cant fucking do that
well yeah of course of course you could
i mean
cross come on
you paid too much for your education to act so stupid
but i think it is the very fact that i do
have a education like this that perhaps
the reason why i thought about
how restructuring the the unit
um the division can actually benefit you me and a couple
cross i appreciate you ambition i really do
uh and uh i think you knowyou
i think you are going to be a great cop
you are a great cop
youre a hero
but at this point right now
you gotta get back to real life
and in real life you got two choices
which are
you can retire on disability
i dont want to do that
alright good i dont want you to do that either
or
you can be reassigned at your current rank
thats it
you gotta work your way up man

detective how do you respond to
these allegations
drugs corruption and gangs
its not an investigation by the
schenectady police department
its an investigation into the
schenectady police department
earlier today da killcullen announced
that his office along with the fbi
will be handing down indictments
that would lead to the arrest of
these schenectady police officers
the da is making allegations today that the
vice officers were acting like the gangs
that they were suppose to be hunting
officer deluca stole drugs and money
even guns from inside the evidence room here
officials say that with that stolen evidence
the cops paid criminals
to help set up their rivals which then
led to those headline robbing arrests
the da announced a star witness
in the case today
hero cop avery cross who less than
a year ago was shot in the line of duty
while trying to save two schenectady residents
from the alledged moto bandit
in schenectady im jessica layton news channel 13
its going to be alright
thanks jess its the largest case of
fraud this region has seen
you know when i was a kid i used to
look at my dad dressed in judges
robes and i used to think that
my father was a superhero
and i dont think i was far off
he had that quality that judges have
where they have tremendous compassion
but they are also ferocious
at the same time
he wasnt afraid of making enemies
i think thats probably why
he had so many friends
i had the chance right before he
fell into the coma to tell him that
i was dedicating my run for attorney general to him
and
he shook his head no and
i didnt understand why
so i leaned in close that he can
whisper and he said to me
ill take the win not the run
that was my dad
that was al
son you want to come with me
sure
avery
yeah
can i talk to you for a minute
sure
close the door
whats wrong
we have to talk about aj
he wants to come and live with you
he wont stop asking me about it
really
i guess thats uh
a good idea at some point
i think he needs you
i think if he doesnt come and live with you
hes going to completely go off the rails
its just that right now you know
with the campaign and everything
its just not an ideal time
i mean what am i going to do with him
i dont know what he likes or
i just dont think it will be
good for him or anybody
i mean come on
okay
you know that
well you can tell him that
jennifer
what am i suppose to tell him
i just dont
why why why are you doing this right now
you can tell him now

second call
this is a c felony so jason could do
anywhere between five and fifteen years

day he spent in jail and a fine
