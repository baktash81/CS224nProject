ladies and gentleman  officer avery cross 
 thank you 
 thank you  thank you for your support 
when i was in law school 
we used toalways talk about   
justice 
we had discussions about justice 
that s just what they were 
discussions 
i joined the police force because i
wanted to work alonside the   
brave men and women who know some
problems can t be solved by talk 
but no one wants to be in the situation
i found myself in a couple of weeks ago 
i certainly wish it had turned out differently 
i m not going to lie 
sometimes i haven t wished that   
maybe it wasn t me that was called
upon that house that day 
but that s the job 
but i can t think of another line of
work i would rather be in 
thank you 
how does it feel 
i m not sure it s doing much good 
 how s the spotlight 
 i m ready for it to end 
don t worry 
it will 
you know the police always put on a big
show when something like this happens because   
the hero card is the only
one they have to play 
i m not really thinking about that dad 
i m just trying to get back to work 
you know if you planned this
it couldn t have turned out any better 
you re not going to make it work for
you in the police department 
i promise you that 
i didn t come here to be lectured dad 
you tricked me 
you said the pool would be good for my knee 
 sorry 
 you know  i m not as calculated as you are 
my life is not a campaign 
it s much simpler 
yeah 
though for somebody who s not campaigning 
you gave a hell of a speech yesterday 
you certainly have my vote 
plus that knee is a gold mine 
no i mean it 
a limp goes a long way in politics 
look at roosevelt 
i got to go see the chief 
i got to go see the chief 
 where you going brother 
 i don t know  i don t know 
is it bad news 
is it gonna be bad news 
oh jesus christ 
don t mess your hair up  pretty boy 
i got a call today from d a  killcullen 
close the door 
the state internal investigation into shooting of
luke glanton has been deemed lawful 
congratulations officer 
you can put it behind you 
get back to police work 
the question is can you go back
out on patrol anytime soon 
and if you could  can you be effective 
i don t think that i can 
that s okay  you know what there s a lot
of jobs to be done around here 
that in ways and you know that 
in ways that are much more important
than what happens out on the street 
i m so glad that you said that  because chief i ve
thought a lot about this and the   
i    i think i can be best utilized as    as lieutenant
in    in charge of special investigations 
there s a lot of restructuring ah within
the division that i ve actually formally   
i can t fucking do that 
well yeah  of course    of course you could 
i mean   
cross come on 
you paid too much for your education to act so stupid 
but i think it is the very fact that i do
have a education like this that perhaps   
the reason why i thought about
how restructuring the    the unit   
 um  the division can actually benefit you  me  and a couple   
 cross  i appreciate you ambition  i really do 
uh and uh i think    you know   you  
i think you are going to be a great cop 
you are a great cop 
you re a hero 
but at this point  right now 
you gotta get back to real life 
 and in real life you got two choices 
 which are 
 you can retire on disability 
 i don t want to do that 
alright  good  i don t want you to do that either 
or   
you can be reassigned at your current rank 
that s it 
you gotta work your way up man 
hey man 
i heard you were down here 
hey 
what are you doing 
what are you doing on plain clothes 
oh you didn t hear 
i made vice 
 get the fuck outta here

you re too smart for your own good 
get right in there for a good shot 
detective  how do you respond to
these allegations 
drugs  corruption  and gangs 
it s not an investigation by the
schenectady police department 
it s an investigation into the
schenectady police department 
earlier today  d a  killcullen announced   
that his office  along with the fbi 
will be handing down indictments   
that would lead to the arrest of
these schenectady police officers 
the d a  is making allegations today that the
vice officers were acting like the gangs   
that they were suppose to be hunting 
officer deluca stole drugs and money 
even guns from inside the evidence room here 
officials say that with that stolen evidence 
the cops paid criminals   
to help set up their rivals  which then
led to those headline robbing arrests 
the d a  announced a star witness
in the case today   
hero cop avery cross  who less than
a year ago was shot in the line of duty   
while trying to save two schenectady residents
from the alledged moto bandit 
 in schenectady  i m jessica layton  news channel 13 
 it s going to be alright 
thanks jess  it s the largest case of
fraud this region has seen 
you know when i was a kid  i used to
look at my dad dressed in judge s   
robes and i used to think that
my father was a superhero 
and i don t think i was far off 
he had that quality that judges have
where they have tremendous compassion 
but they are also ferocious
at the same time 
he wasn t afraid of making enemies 
i think that s probably why
he had so many friends 
i had the chance right before he
fell into the coma to tell him that   
i was dedicating my run for attorney general to him 
and   
he shook his head no and
i didn t understand why 
so i leaned in close that he can
whisper and he said to me   
 i ll take the win  not the run  
that was my dad 
that was al 
 son  you want to come with me 
 sure 
 avery 
 yeah 
 can i talk to you for a minute 
 sure 
close the door 
what s wrong 
we have to talk about aj 
he wants to come and live with you 
he won t stop asking me about it 
really 
i guess that s uh   
a good idea at some point 
i think he needs you 
i think if he doesn t come and live with you 
he s going to    completely go off the rails 
it s just that right now  you know 
with the campaign and everything   
it s just not an ideal time 
i mean  what am i going to do with him 
i don t know what he likes or   
i just don t think it will be
good for him or anybody 
i mean  come on 
okay 
 you know that 
 well you can tell him that 
 jennifer 
 what am i suppose to tell him 
i just don t   
why  why  why are you doing this right now 
you can tell him now

jason  you ve been charged with criminal possession
of a controlled substance in the third degree 
counselor  do you waive a formal
reading of the charges 
yes  please your honor  in regards to my
clients status there has been a discussion   
with the district attorney 
your honor  i may be able to have
this case tentatively resolved today 
 so i ask if you could put it on for second call 
 second call 
this is a c felony  so jason could do
anywhere between five and fifteen years 
but i m getting the impression from the
prosecutor that they may be willing   
to reduce it today to a misdemeanor 
the offer on his particular case   
would be time served  which is the
day he spent in jail  and a fine 
and that would be it 
 can he come home with us today 
 he can 
guess it s your lucky day 
somebody is looking out for you

it was a tight race for over a
year between cross and kellerman   
and then unprecedented events over the last
month will lead to threaten cross s election bid 
first allegations of underage drinking at his house   
and then a violent robbery
from a yet unidentified intruder   
that left his son hospitalized with a concussion 
remarkably cross has managed
to right his campaign   
and now as you see  the district attorney
has just won the election for attorney general 
we will go live now as senator farley
prepares to address the crowds of supporters 
i ve had the honor of knowing
avery cross since he was a boy 
ladies and gentlemen  it is my greatest honor to introduce
the next attorney general of the state of new york 
avery cross
