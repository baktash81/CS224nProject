hey  get your stuff  let s go 
where s the doorbell 
i don t know 
welcome  miller family  this is dr  horn 
in order to protect
the integrity of the house 
the decontamination chamber
is our only way in or out 
eli  will you please enter first
by yourself 
we ll be right behind you 
  you re okay 
  you got this 
raise your arms  please 
hello  eli  i m dr  horn 
hello 
rose 
paul 
  nice to meet you in the flesh finally 
  dr  horn 
  these are my nurses    barbara  maricela 
  pleased to meet you 
did you find the place okay 
  hello  mr  and mrs  miller 
  call me rose 
we re so happy to have you out here 
you re in good hands 
  i know 
  it s so lovely here 
i find the isolation
is good for the soul 
excuse me 
you can take your suit off now 
you re safe 
  what if there are contaminates 
  there aren t any 
this is a clean house 
  he s a little shy 
  there s no rush 
you have to trust yourself first 
will you fetch the millers  luggage 
  right away 
  absolutely 
please  follow me 
i ll show you your room 
  how long will it take 
  the treatment  we do it in three stages 
it s called viral gene therapy 
you see  your immune system produces
too many bad immunoglobulin   
my body carries
a defective rag1 rag2 gene 
which we can correct
using an encoded virus 
  you really know your stuff 
  i read 
rose and paul  you ll be on this floor 
but we re gonna go to eli s room first 
can t he sleep with us 
unfortunately  our patients must be
in their own rooms for treatment 
  how long have you been a doctor 
  i ve been an immunologist for 25 years 
but i started this clean house
three years ago 
how many patients have you treated 
quite a few 
and you ve cured all of them 
hmm 
and you ve cured all of them 
eli  i know you re nervous 
but you don t need to be 
i will make you better 
don t worry about that 
that s the sound of the air filtration 
sometimes it makes the old piping vibrate 
this is an old house 
it had been abandoned for god knows
how long before i bought it  shall we 
what s down there 
not all of the house had been retrofitted
to be a clean environment 
but don t worry  these seals are airtight 
shall we continue 
eli 
this is your room  eli 
i know it s a lot to get used to 
but i hope you don t think of this
as a medical facility 
to me it s a home 
and for now  it s your home 
is the water safe 
the water here is completely filtered 
purer than bottled water 
probably a long time
since you ve had a shower 
you can trust dr  horn  honey 
breathe 
it s okay to breathe 
it s okay 
that s it 
oh  it s been so long 
i love you 
i know 
mwah 
where d you get that 
it s for him to wear
when we go home  do you like it 
did you see his face
when he took off the suit 
he was so happy 
you remember 
happy  hmm 
  i just got a lot on my mind 
  i know 
but this is gonna work 
everything we hoped for 
everything i prayed for is right here 
he s gonna get better 
we just gotta have faith 
i do 
i ve always been a faithful man 
hi 
do you want to come in 
eli 
my god  you re shaking 
can i sleep in your bed tonight 
good morning  eli  how are you feeling 
  okay 
  i heard you didn t sleep well 
there was something in my room 
  what was it 
  i don t know 
like    breathing on the window 
were you asleep or awake 
awake 
i think 
bad dreams are a side effect of
the immunosuppressants you re taking 
i ve even had some patients hallucinate 
it s perfectly normal 
shall we begin 
you re not coming 
mom 
we have to stay here  honey 
we won t move from this spot  promise 
eli 
why don t you make a wish 
what d you wish for 
that i was brave 
you already are 
just this way 
hmm 
stand there 
stand there 
hands in the air 
seis  sesenta y seis 
arms out 
turn around 
wait 
vírese  eli  face this way 
why are you taking my picture 
listo 
where are you from 
do you know what happened to the boy
who asked too many questions 
he got answers 
stations 
so when did this all start  eli 
about four years ago 
but it s much worse now 
my patients are all just like you 
all with failing immune systems 
the condition remains dormant
until around your age 
what do you think is making you sick 
needle 
lots of things 
the air  water 
  dust 
  could be those things 
could be something else 
because what is an autoimmune syndrome
at its core 
it s the body fighting itself  right 
in a normal  healthy body 
antibodies are produced by stem cells
in the marrow 
but in your body  that gene is impaired 
so i m gonna take this modified virus
and inject it into the marrow 
this virus is gonna repair that gene
and reset your entire immune system 
poof  like a magic trick 
right 
scalpel 
bone punch 
so  i want you to count back from 100 
one hundred   
ninety nine   
ninety eight   
keep counting 
ninety seven   
ninety six   
ninety five   
ninety four   
ninety three   
ninety two   
what what   
dr  horn  dr  horn  let me go 
i can t do that  eli 
dr  horn  it burns 
  that s the medication 
  no  no  it really burns 
that means it s working

aah

ha ha ha 
ah  i shouldn t have done that 
  what  with you being sick and all 
  how do you know i m sick 
well  you re in there  aren t you

they say you re what  like 
allergic to the world  right

so you ve never been outside 
no  i have  i mean 
i wasn t born like this 
my mom my mom told me
i was a tough birth 
she was sick a lot when i was pregnant 
er  um  when she was pregnant  but

  hey  you want to see a real trick 
i can light this twig on fire
with my mind 
don t believe me  watch 
you scared of fire 
uh    no 
i used to be scared of fire 
then i learned how to master it 
where s the match 
what match 
come on  it s what you were doing
when you turned around 
you hid it in your palm
and then distracted me 
a good magician never reveals her secrets 
come on  tell me 
what s the fun in that 
some things you just got to
figure out on your own 
anyway  i got to go 
wait 
i could ask my parents
if you could come inside 
in there  no  thanks 
why not 
look  i don t mean
to freak you out  but   
there s just something    off
about the whole place 
gives me the creeps 
actually  i m not even
supposed to be here 
the woman that runs this place 
she doesn t like me 
i don t like her either  she s    shifty 
shifty 
it s just better
if you don t say anything 
see you later  houdini 
what are you doing 
you can t wander this place by yourself 
put this back in your hand 
where did she go 
who 
dear lord   
we are thankful for everything
that you have given us   
and for this time that
we get to spend together as a family 
and especially for placing dr  horn
in our paths 
in jesus  name  amen 
amen 
something on your mind  honey 
he s upset because i yelled at him 
i said i was sorry  but he needs to
put that drip back in his hand 
he won t believe me
that i saw someone in the hallway 
  there s another kid in this house 
  probably one of the nurses 
it wasn t a nurse 
eli 
honey 
calm down  okay 
calm down 
it was another patient 
honey  i m scared  too 
i am  i get scared of new places 
new people sometimes 
but for you  it must be so overwhelming 
on your body and your mind 
but there is nobody else here
except us  i promise 
here  i got it 
right 
eat up 
  looks like shit 
  tastes like shit  too 
i knew it 
 for best results 
practice in a dark place  
who are you 
aah 
no  no  no  no  no 
eli  eli  listen to me 
  shh 
  no 
it s dad  shh  shh  shh 
  honey 
  hey  listen to me  shh  shh  shh 
  hey 
  paul  do something 
  do what 
  no  no  no 
breathe  breathe 
breathe  just breathe  just breathe 
just breathe  just   
it s  uh  it s the medication 
maybe you could lower the dosage
or something 
i mean  if he s seeing things  i mean   
  we put everything on the line for this 
  i know 
everything 
  he was terrified  paul 
  okay  let her do her job 
i i m i m not gonna sugarcoat this 
what we re doing here
is very hard on eli s body 
and some of
the symptoms from his condition
are bound to flare up 
but we need to stay the course
of the medication 
especially with procedure two 
why  what do you mean 
eli s gonna get worse
before he gets better 
hey 
be strong  sweetheart 
we re right here 
good news  eli  we spent the night
working on your stem cells 
and we can confirm
that the gene therapy virus
is correcting the mutation 
this is gonna burn a little bit 
on the count of three 
one  two   
it ll be over before you know it 
  remain calm 
  it burns 
it hurts 
aah  aah  it burns 
breathe  this is supposed to happen 
unfortunately  the virus
that s gonna cure your affliction
is unable to cross
the blood brain barrier 
so we have to penetrate 
drill 
relax 
stress will make your symptoms worse 
you re gonna be fine 
you will be 
jesus  look over my son   
give him the strength to get through this 
you really think praying s gonna help us 
  how is he 
  he had a bit of a reaction today 
a reaction 
yes  it s quite common 
his body s gonna reject the new cells
just like any transplant  okay 
can i see him 
after he s had some rest 
thank you 
dr  horn told me how strong you were   
  there s something shifty about her 
  shifty 
what 
  i think she s making me sicker 
  no  she s not  eli  it s the medication   
i know what i saw  mom 
and it s not the medication 
and if it was  then why do i feel worse 
because it s working 
the good cells are fighting the bad stuff 
you re bound to feel weak 
i wanna leave 
you want to leave 
okay

let me out

mom  mom  dad  help 
what did you do 
it wasn t me 
eli  you were standing
in front of the closet door 
   cause i d been hiding in there 
  with shards of glass 
they wrote it on my window  too 
  your name 
  no   lie  
you could ve hurt yourself  honey 
eli  none of my other patients
have ever mentioned ghosts 
  hey 
  no  no one believes me 
oh  now you decide to show up 
what happened last night 
did i get you in trouble 
you look terrible 
i feel terrible  too 
what happened 
if i tell you 
you have to promise not to laugh 
just spill it 
i think this house is haunted 
i think something bad happened here 
great  now you think i m crazy  too 
no  i don t think you re crazy 
then why d you laugh 
because perry 
the kid who stayed here before you 
he said the same thing 
  he did 
  yep 
well  i don t talk to him
as much as i talk to you 
but he said that he was seeing ghosts 
dr  horn said none of her patients
ever saw ghosts 
and you believe her 
mom and dad said to trust her 
oh  and i m sure your parents
always tell you the truth 
perry said the longer he was in there 
the more clearly he saw them 
and he told dr  horn that 
  well  what did she say 
  i don t know 
he said he was about to get
procedure three 
and that was the last time i saw him 
  i need to get out of here 
  so get your hazmat and go 
i can t  i wouldn t survive outside
without my parents 
wait here a sec

  eli 
eli 
what s going on 
i i heard screams 
he was trying to leave the house 
they opened the door 
haldol  20 ccs 
i thought you said this place was secure 
must have been
an electrical short circuit 
you know about the ghosts 
eli  you have to stop it 
hurry  hurry 
i know about perry 
who who s perry 
  i i don t know what you re talking about 
  lie 
who s perry

someone tell me what s actually going on 
eli  i m right here 
look at me  i m right here 
okay  breathe  breathe 
let s make our wish 
i don t want to make a fucking wish 
mom 
he s   
he s just not   
he s not accepting treatment 
he s just not accepting it  no  he s not 
i think we have to prepare for
the decision  we re just going to do it 
he s not accepting treatment 
so there s no other choice
at this point 
yeah 
i was just saying that i can t believe
that he actually tried to leave 
the last treatment
didn t go as i d hoped 
eli s brain is waging a war
against the serum 
that s why he s feeling
so sick and delusional 
i m going to administer diazepam
to enable him to rest until dawn 
and then we ll begin the final procedure 
wait 
i think i should be the one
that gives it to him 
he ll take it better coming from me 
i m not crazy  mom 
i know you re not 
dad thinks i am 
no  he doesn t 
  he doesn t 
  yes  he does 
he looks at me like he doesn t believe me 
you mean the same way
you re looking at me right now 
you know  this is hard for him 
watching you go through this 
he was the one that found dr  horn 
he looked everywhere
for a doctor to help you 
we would never have brought you here
if we didn t think you could go on
and live a normal life 
but you said you believed me 
i do  i believe
that you saw things  i just   
i just don t believe
the things you saw are real 
hey 
trust me 
i know the effects
medication can have on the mind 
you see something 
and you swear it was real 
but it s not 
i know how hard this is for you 
but it s almost over 
you just need to get some sleep 
  what s that 
  what 
what 
i m not as good at tricks as some people 
here 
  what is it 
  it s just something to help you sleep 
show me 
good 
come here 
you know i love you  right 
i know 
three one seven   
what 
okay  lie down 
sweet dreams 
haley 
bitch  unh 
still alive  huh 
listen  did perry ever say if the ghost
was trying to hurt him or help him 
he didn t say  why 
because they tried to
drag me out of the house 
and i m not sure if they
wanted to kill me or get me to leave 
it kind of sounds like
they wanted to kill you 
why would you think otherwise 
 lie  
they wrote that  on my window
and on my closet door 
but if you turn it upside down   
three one seven  what does that mean 
this is what they ve been
trying to tell me the entire time 
ooh  oh  like a secret code
to a secret door 
i never said it was a door 
don t give me that suspicious look 
it was just the first thing
that entered my head 
you re not a ghost  too  are you 
what kind of drugs do they got you on now 
do i look like a ghost 
i think it is a code to a door   
to the medical wing 
  what s in there 
  answers 
  to what 
  to why she s lying 
are you gonna do it 
what if you get caught 
everybody s gotta sleep 
right 
lie 
what were you and dr  horn talking about 
what 
what were you and dr  horn talking about 
before i came along 
tell me 
just talking about
the need to be prepared   
for all possibilities 
all possibilities  what do you mean 
look  she said that
with each procedure  there are   
inherent risks 
he had a bad reaction to the last one 
and for every chance that
he s gonna pull through  there s   
  what 
  there s a chance that he won t 
she said that 
it s what she said 
that she doesn t think it s gonna work 
then i don t understand 
she s cured every one of her patients 
that s what you told me 
that s what i told eli 
why would you lie to me 
why would you lie to me about that 
just tried to do what s best for eli 
you knew this was always
a possibility  rose 
is his life in danger 
is it 
how dare you 
how dare i 
  i m leaving

  what kind of life is that 
  a life where he is loved 
no amount of love
can protect him from his condition 
you know that  you ve seen with
your own eyes how bad it can get 
it will only get worse 
and by then  it s gonna be too late 
out there  there s nothing but suffering 
there s only suffering for him in here 
  in here  there s still a chance 
  is there
