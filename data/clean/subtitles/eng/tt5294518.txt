in order to protect
the integrity of the house
the decontamination chamber
is our only way in or out
eli will you please enter first
by yourself
well be right behind you
youre okay
you got this
raise your arms please
hello eli im dr horn
hello
rose
paul
nice to meet you in the flesh finally
dr horn
these are my nurses barbara maricela
pleased to meet you
did you find the place okay
hello mr and mrs miller
call me rose
were so happy to have you out here
youre in good hands
i know
its so lovely here
i find the isolation
is good for the soul
excuse me
you can take your suit off now
youre safe
what if there are contaminates
there arent any
this is a clean house
hes a little shy
theres no rush
you have to trust yourself first
will you fetch the millers luggage
right away
absolutely
please follow me
ill show you your room
how long will it take
the treatment we do it in three stages
its called viral gene therapy
you see your immune system produces
too many bad immunoglobulin
my body carries
a defective rag1rag2 gene
which we can correct
using an encoded virus
you really know your stuff
i read
rose and paul youll be on this floor
but were gonna go to elis room first
cant he sleep with us
unfortunately our patients must be
in their own rooms for treatment
how long have you been a doctor
ive been an immunologist for 25 years
but i started this clean house
three years ago
how many patients have you treated
quite a few
and youve cured all of them
hmm
and youve cured all of them
eli i know youre nervous
but you dont need to be
i will make you better
dont worry about that
thats the sound of the air filtration
sometimes it makes the old piping vibrate
this is an old house
it had been abandoned for god knows
how long before i bought it shall we
whats down there
not all of the house had been retrofitted
to be a clean environment
but dont worry these seals are airtight
shall we continue
eli
this is your room eli
i know its a lot to get used to
but i hope you dont think of this
as a medical facility
to me its a home
and for now its your home
is the water safe
the water here is completely filtered
purer than bottled water
probably a long time
since youve had a shower
you can trust dr horn honey
breathe
its okay to breathe
its okay
thats it
oh its been so long
i love you
i know
mwah
whered you get that
its for him to wear
when we go home do you like it
did you see his face
when he took off the suit
he was so happy
you remember
happy hmm
i just got a lot on my mind
i know
but this is gonna work
everything we hoped for
everything i prayed for is right here
hes gonna get better
we just gotta have faith
i do
ive always been a faithful man
hi
do you want to come in
eli
my god youre shaking
can i sleep in your bed tonight
good morning eli how are you feeling
okay
i heard you didnt sleep well
there was something in my room
what was it
i dont know
like breathing on the window
were you asleep or awake
awake
i think
bad dreams are a side effect of
the immunosuppressants youre taking
ive even had some patients hallucinate
its perfectly normal
shall we begin
youre not coming
mom
we have to stay here honey
we wont move from this spot promise
eli
why dont you make a wish
whatd you wish for
that i was brave
you already are
just this way
hmm
stand there
stand there
hands in the air
seis sesenta y seis
arms out
turn around
wait
v√≠rese eli face this way
why are you taking my picture
listo
where are you from
do you know what happened to the boy
who asked too many questions
he got answers
stations
so when did this all start eli
about four years ago
but its much worse now
my patients are all just like you
all with failing immune systems
the condition remains dormant
until around your age
what do you think is making you sick
needle
lots of things
the air water
dust
could be those things
could be something else
because what is an autoimmune syndrome
at its core
its the body fighting itself right
in a normal healthy body
antibodies are produced by stem cells
in the marrow
but in your body that gene is impaired
so im gonna take this modified virus
and inject it into the marrow
this virus is gonna repair that gene
and reset your entire immune system
poof like a magic trick
right
scalpel
bone punch
so i want you to count back from 100
one hundred
ninetynine
ninetyeight
keep counting
ninetyseven
ninetysix
ninetyfive
ninetyfour
ninetythree
ninetytwo

uh no
i used to be scared of fire
then i learned how to master it
wheres the match
what match
come on its what you were doing
when you turned around
you hid it in your palm
and then distracted me
a good magician never reveals her secrets
come on tell me
whats the fun in that
some things you just got to
figure out on your own
anyway i got to go
wait
i could ask my parents
if you could come inside
in there no thanks
why not
look i dont mean
to freak you out but
theres just something off
about the whole place
gives me the creeps
actually im not even
supposed to be here
the woman that runs this place
she doesnt like me
i dont like her either shes shifty
shifty
its just better
if you dont say anything
see you later houdini
what are you doing
you cant wander this place by yourself
put this back in your hand
where did she go
who
dear lord
we are thankful for everything
that you have given us
and for this time that
we get to spend together as a family
and especially for placing dr horn
in our paths
in jesus name amen
amen
something on your mind honey
hes upset because i yelled at him
i said i was sorry but he needs to
put that drip back in his hand
he wont believe me
that i saw someone in the hallway
theres another kid in this house
probably one of the nurses
it wasnt a nurse
eli
honey
calm down okay
calm down
it was another patient
honey im scared too
i am i get scared of new places
new people sometimes
but for you it must be so overwhelming
on your body and your mind
but there is nobody else here
except us i promise
here i got it
right
eat up
looks like shit
tastes like shit too
i knew it
for best results
practice in a dark place
who are you

i mean if hes seeing things i mean
we put everything on the line for this
i know
everything
he was terrified paul
okay let her do her job
iimim not gonna sugarcoat this
what were doing here
is very hard on elis body
and some of
the symptoms from his condition
are bound to flare up
but we need to stay the course
of the medication
especially with procedure two
why what do you mean
elis gonna get worse
before he gets better
hey
be strong sweetheart
were right here
good news eli we spent the night
working on your stem cells
and we can confirm
that the gene therapy virus
is correcting the mutation
this is gonna burn a little bit
on the count of three
one two
itll be over before you know it
remain calm
it burns
it hurts
aah aah it burns
breathe this is supposed to happen
unfortunately the virus
thats gonna cure your affliction
is unable to cross
the bloodbrain barrier
so we have to penetrate
drill
relax
stress will make your symptoms worse
youre gonna be fine
you will be
jesus look over my son
give him the strength to get through this
you really think prayings gonna help us
how is he
he had a bit of a reaction today
a reaction
yes its quite common
his bodys gonna reject the new cells
just like any transplant okay
can i see him
after hes had some rest
thank you
dr horn told me how strong you were
theres something shifty about her
shifty
what
i think shes making me sicker
no shes not eli its the medication
i know what i saw mom
and its not the medication
and if it was then why do i feel worse
because its working
the good cells are fighting the bad stuff
youre bound to feel weak
i wanna leave

dr horn said none of her patients
ever saw ghosts
and you believe her
mom and dad said to trust her
oh and im sure your parents
always tell you the truth
perry said the longer he was in there
the more clearly he saw them
and he told dr horn that
well what did she say

he said he was about to get
procedure three
and that was the last time i saw him
i need to get out of here

mom
hes
hes just not
hes not accepting treatment
hes just not accepting it no hes not

the decision were just going to do it
hes not accepting treatment
so theres no other choice
at this point
yeah
i was just saying that i cant believe
that he actually tried to leave
the last treatment
didnt go as id hoped
elis brain is waging a war
against the serum
thats why hes feeling
so sick and delusional
im going to administer diazepam
to enable him to rest until dawn
and then well begin the final procedure
wait
i think i should be the one
that gives it to him
hell take it better coming from me
im not crazy mom
i know youre not
dad thinks i am
no he doesnt
he doesnt
yes he does
he looks at me like he doesnt believe me
you mean the same way
youre looking at me right now
you know this is hard for him
watching you go through this
he was the one that found dr horn
he looked everywhere
for a doctor to help you
we would never have brought you here
if we didnt think you could go on
and live a normal life
but you said you believed me
i do i believe
that you saw things i just
i just dont believe
the things you saw are real
hey
trust me
i know the effects
medication can have on the mind
you see something
and you swear it was real
but its not
i know how hard this is for you
but its almost over
you just need to get some sleep
whats that
what

im not as good at tricks as some people

you know i love you right
i know
threeoneseven
what
okay lie down
sweet dreams
haley
bitch unh
still alive huh
listen did perry ever say if the ghost
was trying to hurt him or help him
he didnt say why
because they tried to
drag me out of the house
and im not sure if they
wanted to kill me or get me to leave
it kind of sounds like
they wanted to kill you
why would you think otherwise
lie
they wrote that on my window
and on my closet door
but if you turn it upside down
threeoneseven what does that mean
this is what theyve been
trying to tell me the entire time
ooh oh like a secret code
to a secret door

dont give me that suspicious look
it was just the first thing
that entered my head
youre not a ghost too are you

the need to be prepared

with each procedure there are
inherent risks
he had a bad reaction to the last one
and for every chance that
hes gonna pull through theres
what
theres a chance that he wont
she said that
its what she said
that she doesnt think its gonna work
then i dont understand
shes cured every one of her patients
thats what you told me
