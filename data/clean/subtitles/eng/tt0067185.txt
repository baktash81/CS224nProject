  yeah 
darling  be a dear and cancel my
appointment with rené this afternoon 
i know he ll be furious
but i ve had such a fright today
and with guests coming
this evening    oh  would you 
tell him i promise to be in
on tuesday 
thank you  fée 
you re a darling  yes 
bye  bye 
dinner at eight  harold 
and do try and be
a little more vivacious 
of course  harold s father
had a similar sense of the absurd 
i remember once in paris 
he just stepped out for cigarettes
and the next thing i knew
he was arrested
for floating nude down the seine 
experimenting in river currents
with rubber water wings 
mauve ones 
that cost quite a bit of influence et
d argent to hush up  i can tell you 
harold  dear 
don t play with your food 
what s the matter 
don t you feel well 
i have a sore throat 
now  directly after dinner 
i want you to go straight to bed 
harold s always been
a delicate child 
even as a baby  he seemed prone
to every possible kind of illness 
harold  dear  eat up your beets 
i remember in tokyo  i had
to call the embassy for a doctor   
oh  my god 
this is too much 
i can t stand much more of this 
i can t take any more 
oh  my god 
oh  god 
that s very interesting  harold 
and i think very illuminating 
there seems to be
a definite pattern emerging
and of course this pattern 
once isolated  can be coped with 
recognise the problem and you re
halfway on the road to its   
its solution 
tell me  harold 
what do you do for fun 
what activity gives you a different
sense of enjoyment from the others 
what do you find fulfilling 
what gives you that special   
satisfaction 
i go to funerals 
 thou dost prepare for me a table
in the sight of my adversaries 
 thou dost anoint my head with oil 
 my chalice overflows 
 kindness and grace shall follow me
all the days of my life
 and i shall dwell in the house
of the lord for length of days 
 the earth is the lord s
and the fullness thereof 
 the world
and they who dwell therein 
 for he has established it upon the
waters and set it upon the rivers 
 who shall ascend
the mountain of the lord
 or who shall stand
in his holy place 
 the innocent of hand
and the pure of heart
 who has not turned his mind
to vanity
 nor sworn deceitfully
to his neighbour 
 he shall receive the blessing
from the lord
 and a reward from god 
his saviour 
 this is the generation of those
who seek him    
harold 
why you purchased that monstrosity
i have no idea 
you can have any car you want
but that ugly horror is an eyesore
and an embarrassment 
really  it is time you settled down
and stopped flitting away your
talents on these amateur theatrics 
these little divertissements 
no matter how
psychologically purging they may be 
i don t know what to do 
go and have a talk
with your uncle victor 
perhaps he can fathom you 
after all  he was
general macarthur s right hand man 
what do you say  harold 
it s a great life 
there s action  adventure  advising
and you ll see the war first hand 
and there are plenty
of slant eyed girls 
it ll make a man out of you  harold 
you ll travel the world  put on
a uniform and take on a man s job 
you ll walk tall with a glint in
your eye and a spring in your step
and a knowledge in your heart
that you are working for peace
and are serving your country 
just like nathan hale 
that s what this country needs 
more nathan hale 
i think i can see
a little nathan hale    in you 
tell me  harold  how many of these   
suicides have you performed 
an accurate number
would be difficult to gauge 
well  just give me a rough estimate 
a rough estimate 
i d say    15 
  15 
  that s a rough estimate 
were they all done
for your mother s benefit 
no  no   i would not say benefit 
harold  i only have a few minutes and
i want to inform you of my decision 
you have led a very carefree 
idle  happy life up to the present 
the life of a child 
but it is time now
to put away childish things
and take on adult responsibilities 
we d all like to sail through life
with no thought of tomorrow
but that cannot be 
we have our duties 
our obligations  our principles 
in short  harold  i think it is time
for you to get married 
let s pray to the lord 
king of glory 
that he may bless and deliver
the souls of all faithful departed
from the pain of hell
and the bottomless pit 
deliver them from the lion s mouth
and the darkness therein
and rather  bring them
to the blessing of light 
holy life  eternal rest 
 oh  lord  do not bring yourself
into trial
 for no man   
 becomes holy in your sight unless
you grant forgiveness of his sins 
 i implore you  therefore 
 do not let the verdict
of your judgement go against him   
 rather  by the help of your grace 
 may he escape the sentence
which he deserves
 for during his earthly life he would
sign the seal of the holy trinity 
 you  who live and reign
forever and ever 
 amen  
  like some liquorice 
  no  thank you 
you re welcome 
did you know him 
  no 
  me neither 
i heard he s 80 years old 
i ll be 80 next week 
a good time to move on 
don t you think 
i don t know 
i mean  75 is too early but at 85 
you re just marking time 
you may as well
look over the horizon 
i ll never understand
this mania for black 
nobody sends black flowers  do they 
black flowers are dead flowers 
who sends dead flowers to a funeral 
it s absurd 
  what is your name 
  harold  harold chasen 
how do you do  i m dame marjorie
chardin but you may call me maude 
  nice to meet you 
  thank you 
i think we re gonna be great friends 
can i give you a lift  harold 
no  thank you  i have my own car 
well  i must be off 
we shall have to meet again 
tell me  do you dance 
  pardon me 
  do you sing and dance 
  no 
  no  i thought not 
that woman  she took my car 
i have here the forms sent out by
the national computer dating service 
they screen out the fat and the ugly 
so it is obviously
a firm of high standards 
first  here is
the personality interview 
which you are to fill out and return 
now then  are you ready  harold 
here is the first question 
 are you uncomfortable
meeting new people  
well  i think that s a yes 
don t you agree 
 should sex education be taught
outside the home  
i would say no  wouldn t you  harold 
yeah  we ll give a d there 
 should women run for
president of the united states  
i don t see why not  absolutely yes 
 do you remember jokes and take
pleasure in relating them to others  
well  you don t do that 
do you  harold  absolutely not 
 do you often get the feeling that
perhaps life isn t worth living  
what do you think  harold  a  b 
we ll put c   not sure 
 is the subject of sex being
overexploited by our mass media  
well  that would have to be yes 
wouldn t it 
 is it difficult for you
to accept criticism  
no  we ll mark d 
 do you sometimes have headaches
or backaches after a difficult day  
yes  i do indeed 
 do you go to sleep easily  
i d say so 
 do you believe
in capital punishment for murder  
yes  i do indeed 
 in your opinion  are social affairs
usually a waste of time  
heavens  no 
 can god influence our lives  
yes  absolutely yes 
 does your personal religion
or philosophy
 include a life after death  
yes  indeed  that s absolutely 
 did you enjoy life
when you were a child  
yes  you were a wonderful baby 
harold 
 do you think the sexual revolution
has gone too far  
it certainly has 
 do you find the idea
of wife swapping distasteful  
i even find the question distasteful 
 do you    
harold  please 
 do you have ups and downs
without obvious reason  
that s you  harold 
 dearest brothers  let us faithfully
and lovingly remember our brother
 whom god has taken to himself
from the trials of this world 
 god have mercy 
christ have mercy  lord have mercy  
our father  who art in heaven 
hallowed be thy name 
thy kingdom come  thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven 
give us this day  our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive
those who trespass against us 
lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil 
amen 
my boy  excuse me 
one moment  please  who was that
old lady waving to you earlier 
hello  harold  can i give you a lift 
there you are  madam  were you the
lady who drove my car off yesterday 
  the one with the st christopher 
  yes 
then i suppose it was me 
get in  harold 
were you also the one
who painted the saint 
yes  how did you like that 
  well  i didn t 
  don t be too discouraged 
for aesthetic appreciation 
always a little time 
what a delight it is  harold 
to bump into you again 
i knew we were gonna be good friends
the moment i saw you 
  you go to funerals often 
  yeah 
so do i 
they re such fun  aren t they 
it s all change  all revolving 
burials and births  all linked 
the great circle of life 
this thing handles well 
ever drive a hearse  harold 
  yeah 
  it s a new experience for me 
well done  hearse 
shall i take you home  harold 
this is my car 
  your hearse 
  yearse 
then you shall take me home 
so  just before he left
for the monastery in tibet 
big sweeney gave me his keys 
i had to make changes for the new
model  not as many as you d think 
once you have you the basic set 
it s only a question of variation 
you hop in any car you want
and just drive off 
not any car  i like a variety  i m
always looking for a new experience 
maybe    nevertheless 
i think you re upsetting people 
i don t know if that s right 
if people get upset cos they feel
they have a hold on some things 
i m just acting as a gentle reminder 
here today  gone tomorrow 
so don t get attached to things 
now  with that in mind 
i m not against collecting stuff 
i ve collected quite
a lot of stuff in my time 
this is all memorabilia
but it s incidental  not integral 
if you know what i mean 
the birds 
i love them so much 
they are the only wildlife
i get to see any more 
ah  me  free as a bird 
at one time  i used to break into
pet shops to liberate the canaries
but i decided that was an idea
way before its time 
zoos are full 
prisons are overflowing 
oh  my  how the world still   
dearly loves a cage 
please sit down  harold 
i ll put the kettle on 
we ll have a nice  hot cup of tea 
thank you but i really have to go 
but it s oat straw tea 
you ve not had that  have you 
  no 
  well  then 
i really do have to go 
i have an appointment 
i really can t miss it 
at the dentist 
kind of 
then  you ll just have to come back
and visit 
  all right 
  my door s always open 
  all right 
  promise 
i promise 
i asked  do you have any friends 
  no 
  none at all 
no 
maybe one 
would you care to talk about
this friend 
no 
you are an interesting case
but this reluctance is detrimental
to the psychoanalytical process 
do you understand 
very well 
your mother tells me that she s
arranging several dates for you
with some young ladies 
how do you feel about that 
  hello  i m candy gulf 
  how do you do  i m mrs chasen 
do come in  harold s in the garden
but he ll be here in a moment 
shall we sit down 
there s harold 
  he seems very nice 
  thank you 
  you are at the university 
  yes  i am 
  what are you studying 
  poli sci with a minor in home ec 
poli sci    
political science 
it s all about what s going on 
is harold interested in
what s going on 
i just think
it s such a super thing to study
and i can always fall back
on my home ec 
  that s good planning 
  yes 
tell me  are you a regular
with this computer club 
heavens  no 
i don t have to worry about dates 
some of the girls in my sorority
decided that someone ought to try it
so we drew straws and i lost 
but i m looking forward to
meeting harold 
i should mention  candy  harold does
have his little eccentric moments 
that s all right  i have a brother
who s a real cut up  too 
i will never forget the time 
we had this old tv set
with no parts in it 
tommy stuck his head behind it
and started giving a whole newscast
before the entire family 
must have been very funny 
yes  dear  here is harold now 
harold  this is candy 
candy s just been telling us
a funny story about   
walter cronkite 
excuse me 
  i beg your pardon 
  what do you want 
i m sorry  i was looking for maude 
how about some ginger pie 
  fine  thank you 
  i ll heat some up 
my  harold 
i m glad to see you again 
do you often model for glaucus 
heavens  no 
i don t have the time
but i like to keep in practice
and poor glaucus occasionally
needs his memory refreshed
as to the contours
of the female form 
  do you disapprove 
  me  no  of course not 
really  do you think it s wrong 
no 
heavens  i m glad you said that 
i wanna show you my painting 
this is the rape of rome 
over in the corner
is leda and the swan 
self portrait 
and over here is my favourite 
it s titled    rainbow with
egg underneath and an elephant 
  do you like it 
  yeah  very much 
i then became infatuated with these 
my odorifics 
give the nose a treat 
a kind of a    olfactory banquet 
so  i began on the easiest  
roast beef  old books  mown grass
and mexican farmyard 
here s one you ll like 
snowfall on 42nd street 
i ll put it on 
now  you hold onto this 
i ll pump it up 
now  hold it up there  that s right 
what do you smell 
subways 
perfume 
cigarettes 
  snow 
  sn    
it goes on and on 
it s just great 
but    then i decided
to switch to the tactile 
  what do you think 
  i like this 
no  no  really get close
and reach in and feel 
there s my kettle 
well    stroke   
palm    caress    explore 
here we are 
oat straw tea and ginger pie 
excuse the mismatched saucers 
  this is a new experience for me 
  wonderful 
try something new each day  after
all  we re given life to find it out 
doesn t last forever 
you look as if you could 
did i tell you
i ll be 80 on saturday 
you don t look 80 
that s the influence of the right
food  exercises and breathing 
greet the dawn with a breath of fire 
there s no question 
my body s giving out 
i m well into autumn  it s all gonna
be over after saturday 
tell me about yourself  what do you
do when you aren t at funerals 
yes  there is definitely
a certain attraction 
i ask you though  harold 
is it enough 
what do you mean 
i like to watch things grow 
they    grow and bloom and   
fade and die
and change into something else 
life 
i should like to change
into a sunflower most of all 
they re so tall and simple 
what flower would you like to be 
i don t know 
  one of these maybe 
  why do you say that 
  because they re all alike 
  but they re not 
look  see  some are smaller 
some are fatter 
some grow to the left 
some to the right 
some  even  have lost some petals 
all kinds of observable differences 
you see  harold  i feel that
much of the world s sorrow
comes from people who are this   
yet  allow themselves
to be treated as that 
power steering 
that little tree is in trouble 
come on 
look at it 
it s suffocating  it s the smog 
people can live with it but trees 
it gives them asthma 
they can t breathe 
the leaves  they re turning brown 
harold  we have got to do something
about this life 
  what 
  we ll transplant it to the forest 
  you can t do that 
  why not 
  this is public property 
  well  exactly 
well  we ll need tools 
you re right 
we ll go see glaucus  come on 
wait a minute 
police  come 
good afternoon  officer 
a bit of trouble here 
yes  ma am 
someone had trouble parking 
tell me  that car over there 
is that parked all right 
yes  ma am  that s fine 
thank you so much  you might turn
the radio off   saves the battery 
a little after dinner liqueur 
harold 
  thank you  i don t drink 
  it s all right  it s organic 
  thanks 
  it has no nutritional value
but consistency
is not really a human trait 
what is that up there 
that s my umbrella 
that s just a relic  i found it when
i was packing to come to america 
it used to be my defence
on picket lines and rallies
and political meetings 
being dragged off by the police
and attacked by thugs 
what were you fighting for 
big issue 
liberty  rights  justice 
kings died  kingdoms fell 
i don t regret the kingdom 
what sense in borders
and nations and patriotism 
but i miss the kings 
when i was a little girl 
i was taken to the palace in vienna
to a garden party 
i can still see the sun shining 
the parasols 
the flashing uniforms
of the young officers 
i thought then
that i would marry a soldier 
later on 
frederick would chide me about it 
he was so serious 
a doctor at the university   
and in the government 
but that was all before 
so   
you don t use the umbrella any more 
no more revolts 
yes  every day   
but    i don t need a defence
any more  i embrace 
still fighting for the big issues
but now in my small  individual way 
shall we have a song 
  i don t play   
  come on  i ll show you 
no   
harold  join in 
that was fun 
let s play something together 
  i don t play anything 
  nothing  
dear me  everybody should be able
to make some music 
that s the cosmic dance 
come with me 
there has to be something 
now  let me see   
hold onto this  what is this 
just a second  there we are 
you take   
this is the one  take that 
just be impulsive  be fanciful 
let the music flow out of you 
you gotta make some chords 
put your finger
on the second fret there
and this one on the third 
then this one here 
harold dear 
there you are 
i have a little surprise for you 
it s a present 
come along 
there 
isn t it darling 
i had them take away that monstrous
thing of yours and send this 
so much more appropriate 
don t you think 
one thing more  harold 
i telephoned
your second computer date
and she seems a very nice 
quiet girl 
cute little thing  isn t it 
i like it very much 
your licence  lady 
i don t have one 
i don t believe in them 
  how long you been driving  lady 
  about 45 minutes  i guess 
we were hoping to start sooner
but it s rather hard to find a truck 
is this your truck 
no  i just took it 
  you took it 
  yes  i have to plant my tree 
well  it s not mine really
but we would like to get it
into soil as soon as possible 
let me get this straight  you   
all right  then  we ll be off 
nice chatting with you 
  he was very nice 
  yeah 
  i think he s following us 
  is he  
the police 
always wanting to play games 
ma am 
is the little tree all right 
yeah  fine 
terrific 
there 
i love the feel of soil  don t you 
and the smell 
it s the earth   
the earth is my body 
my head is in the stars 
who said that 
i don t know 
i suppose i did 
poor baby 
isn t it wonderful  
all around us  living things 
all right  out  lady 
  come on 
  hello  have we met before 
none of that  lady  out 
it must have been your brother 
there is a family resemblance 
buddy  get out of the car 
just stand over there  lady 
get out  buster 
you re in a lot of trouble  lady 
i have you for several offences 
including   
possession of a stolen vehicle 
resisting arrest and possession
of a stolen tree  where is it 
  we planted it 
  you planted it 
  is this your shovel 
  no 
possession of a stolen shovel 
don t get officious 
you re not yourself when you are 
that s the curse of a government job 
lady 
are you gonna take
a lot of time with this 
  lady  please  just quiet  please 
  cos if you are   
grab the shovel  harold 
lady  stop or i ll have to shoot 
i sure am picking up on vices 
vice  virtue 
it s best not to be too moral 
you cheat yourself out of
too much life  aim above morality 
if you apply that to life 
then you re bound to live it fully 
i haven t lived 
i ve died a few times 
what was that 
well   
the first time
was when i was at boarding school 
in the chemistry lab 
i was in there cleaning it up so i
decided i d do a little experiment 
you know  so i got all this stuff out
and began mixing it up 
it was very scientific 
there was this massive explosion 
it knocked me down 
blew out a huge hole in the floor 
there was boards and bricks
and flames leaping up 
i figured  you know    time to leave 
my career in school was over 
so    i went home 
my mother was a giving a party so
i went up the back stairs to my room 
turned out the light and   
i got this funny feeling 
the doorbell rang 
i went out to the banister
and these two policemen came in 
found my mother    and    told her
that i was killed in the fire 
she put one hand up to her forehead 
the other one she reached out
as if groping for support 
and with this long sigh 
she collapsed in their arms 
i decided right then
that i enjoyed being dead 
i understand 
a lot of people enjoy being dead
but they re not dead really 
they re just backing away from life 
reach out and take a chance 
get hurt even 
but play as well as you can 
go team  go 
gimme an l  gimme an i 
gimme a v  gimme an e 
l l v e  live 
otherwise you got nothing
to talk about in the locker room 
i like you  maude 
i like you  harold 
harold is down at the garage 
he has a new car
and he s just been tuning it up 
  he s very mechanical 
  what kind of car is it 
it s a little jaguar 
it looks like a hearse 
very nice  you know  compact 
edith  i d like you to meet
my son harold 
harold  this is edith   
  phern 
  phern  very pleased to meet you 
i think you should go and wash up

and what do you do  my dear 
i m a file clerk 
harrison feed and grain 
well  what is it exactly that you do 
i m in charge of all the invoices
for the southwest 
how interesting 
we supply  for example 
most of the egg farmers in pataluma 
  so you can imagine   
  yes 
here s harold now 
don t get up  dear 
edith has been talking about her job 
i m a file clerk 
henderson feed and grain 
harrison  harrison feed and grain 
it s at hamilton and 4th 
i m in charge of the invoices 
i type up the schedule
for the trucking fleet 
she supplies the whole southwest
with chicken feed 
well  not exactly
the whole southwest 
although we do do a large business 
barley was very big last week 
1 500   
bushels 
in view of your recent actions 
harold 
you have left me with no recourse
but to listen to
your uncle s proposed solution 
consequently  i have instructed him
to induct you into the service 
and for your own good 
to take up active duty
with the united states army 
and i hope they have more luck
with you than i 
maude  they re gonna draft me 
well  don t go 
they ll put me in jail 
well  historically 
you ll be in very good company 
maude  can you help me 
with your skill and my experience  i
think we can come up with something 
look on me
as a father in this matter 
i know you have no desire
to join the army
but once you re in  you ll love it 
it s a great life 
look at me   chauffeur  respect 
money in the bank 
it has its drawbacks
like anything else  i suppose 
but the army takes care of you
and you ve got a buddy for life 
good idea coming out here  harold 
it s a lovely spot 
  thank you  uncle 
  call me sir 
that s the first thing you learn 
an officer deserves your respect 
yes  sir 
let s examine the facts on it 
i say this country has been too harsh
on its outright condemnation of war 
you can point to the many
material advantages brought about
by a crisis and conflict policy 
hell  world war ii gave us
the ballpoint pen 
in wartime 
the national suicide rate drops 
is that a fact  now  why in hell
did we give up on the germans 
since the damn politicians
chalked them up on our side 
the wars ever since
have been a national disgrace 
hell  look at history  
the two best wars we ever
fought were against the jerries 
i say get the krauts
on the other side where they belong 
let s have an enemy worth killing
and a war this country can support 
that s pretty strong stuff  sir 
well  harold  i ve always been a man
that speaks his piece 
always hurt me 
i m not liked in washington 
i know that   
but i do have friends in high places 
they kept falling 
joe falls back 
a neat  red hole in his head 
only one thing
kept going through my mind 
kill  kill  for joe and mack
and all the rest of the guys 
kill  and then there was
a blinding flash   
and i woke up on a stretcher 
 did we hold   i asked the medic 
 yes  sir   he said   
and i slipped into unconsciousness 
boy 
that s a terrific story  sir 
well  you ll have stories like that
to tell of your own some day 
  do you think so  sir 
  sure you will 
gee  i never dreamed
it could be that exciting 
it s the most exciting thing
in the world 
to pit your own life against another 
  yes 
  to kill 
the taste of blood in your mouth 
the moment of truth 
  another man s life in your sights 
  yes 
  will they really teach me to shoot 
  sure  a range of weapons 
  to use a bayonet

shall i come and visit you tomorrow 
oh  i can t 
i have a luncheon date   
with a girl 
i don t even know her 
my mother arranged it 
look 
dreyfus once wrote from
devil s island that he would see
the most glorious birds 
many years later in brittany  he
realised they had only been seagulls 
for me  they will
always be glorious birds 
i cannot emphasise too strongly
the importance of this meeting 
this is the last girl so this is
your third and final chance 
and please try to be serious  harold 
if not for your sake 
at least for hers 
there she is 
sunshine  i d like you
to meet harold 
harold  this is sunshine doré 
how do    how do you do 
i can t complain 
sunshine is an actress  harold 
  i like to think so 
  wonderful

to the music room
and i ll follow with some drinks 
or perhaps starlight
would like a cigarette 
  sunshine 
  yes  of course 
sunshine 
would you like a cigarette 
no  thank you  they stain my fingers 
is sunshine your real name 
well  actually it was the name
of my drama teacher  louis sunshine 
perhaps you ve heard of him 
he was such an influence on
the development of my instrument 
that means my body in theatre talk 
doré is my real name 
well  dore  actually 
oh  my  what a lovely place
you have here 
do you play 
no  i am learning the ban   
the harmonica 
is this your father 
no  it s my uncle victor

the military  don t you 
what a wonderful collection
of knives  may i see them 
no  don t touch  they re very old 
do you enjoy knives 
oh  yes 
you might find this one interesting 
it s a hara kiri blade 
what s hara kiri 
that was marvellous 
it had the ring of truth 
i played juliet
in the sunshine playhouse 
louis thought it was
my best performance 
what s here 
a cup  closed in my true love s hand 
poison  i see 
hath been his timeless end 
o  happy dagger 
o  happy dagger 
this is thy sheath 
there rest   
   and let me die   
i i ve   
that was your last date 
it wasn t very scary 
no  it had nothing on this afternoon 
come on  you loved it 
it was a new experience 
you sure have a way with people 
well  they re my species 
look at these stars 
here 
a gift 
 harold loves maude 
and maude loves harold 
this is the nicest present
that i ve received in years 
so i ll always know where it is 
could i speak with fée  please 
fée  darling 
i know rené will be furious but   
if he knew what i had to put up with
in the last few days 
  mother 
  not now  dear 
could you put me down for monday 
  i d like to talk to you 
  i m on the phone 
i m getting married 
what did you say 
i m getting married 
hold the line  fée 
to who 
i suppose you think this
is very funny  harold  a sunflower 
you can t be serious 
your mother has spoken to me
about your marriage plan
and although i have nothing
against marriage 
i don t think
this is quite    normal 
a very common neurosis 
particularly in this society 
whereby the male child subconsciously
wishes to sleep with his mother 
of course  what puzzles me  harold 
is that you want to sleep
with your grandmother 
i would be remiss in my duty   
if i did not tell you   
that the idea of   
intercourse   
and the fact of your firm  young   
body   
co mingling   
with the   
withered flesh   
sagging   
breasts   
and   
flabby   
buttocks   
makes me want   
to vomit 
it s    dazzling 
you ve thought of everything 
and champagne 
it s all right  it s organic 
for you 
and   
after dinner   
one more little surprise   
that i hope will make you very happy 
i am happy 
i couldn t imagine
a lovelier farewell 
farewell 
yes  it s my 80th birthday 
well  you re not going anywhere   
are you 
yes  dear 
i took the tablets an hour ago 
i ll be gone by midnight 
what  
what a fuss this is  so unnecessary 
don t die  maude  for christ s sake 
don t upset yourself so
