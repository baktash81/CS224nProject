 henry  no 
 tommy  what the fuck

 banging 
 banging continues 
 tommy  he is still alive  you piece of shit 
die  motherfucker 
 grunting 
 tommy  look at me 
 multiple gunshots 
 henry  as far back as i can remember 
i always wanted to be a gangster 
    big band tune plays  background    
    i know i d go from rags to riches    
    if you would only say you care    
    and though my pocket may be empty    
    i d be a millionaire    
    my clothes may still be torn
and tattered    
 henry  to me   
    being a gangster was better than
being president of the united states 
even before i went to the cabstand
for an after school job   
    i knew i wanted to be a part of them 
it was there that i knew i belonged 
to me  it meant being somebody   
    in a neighborhood full of nobodies 
they weren t like anybody else 
they did whatever they wanted 
they parked in front of hydrants
and never got a ticket 
when they played cards all night   
    nobody ever called the cops 
    must i forever be a beggar    
    whose golden dreams will not come true    
 tuddy  tony stacks  how are you 
 henry  tuddy cicero 
 tony  could this be the canarsie kid 
 henry  tuddy 
tuddy ran the cabstand
and the bella vista pizzeria   
    and other places for his brother  paul 
who was the boss of the neighborhood 
 chattering and chuckling 
paulie might have moved slow   
    but it was only because paulie didn t
have to move for anybody 
   tony  it is your fault 
   ronnie  you started it 
 tony  i started it  it is your fault 
 henry  at first my parents loved
that i found a job   
    across the street from the house 
my father  who was irish 
was sent to work at the age of 11 
he liked that i got myself a job 
he always used to say
that american kids were spoiled lazy 
 henry s mother  henry  watch how you cross 
bring back milk 
 henry  my mother was happy
after she found out the ciceros   
    came from the same part of sicily
as she did  to my mother   
    that was the answer to all her prayers 
i was the luckiest kid in the world 
i could go anywhere  do anything 
i knew everybody  and everybody knew me 
wiseguys would pull up and tuddy
would let me park their cadillacs 
here i am  this little kid 
i can t even see over the steering wheel   
    and i m parking cadillacs 
but  it wasn t too long   
    before my parents changed
their minds about my job at the cabstand 
for them  it was supposed to be
a part time job  but for me   
    it was definitely full time 
that is all i wanted to do 
people like my father could never
understand  but i was a part of something 
i belonged  i was treated like a grown up 
 tuddy  tell him 519 
 henry  every day i was learning to score 
a dollar here  a dollar there 
i was living in a fantasy 
did you have a good day at school 
 henry  my father was always pissed off 
pissed that he made such lousy money 
that my brother michael   
    was in a wheelchair 
he was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house 
tell me about this 
 henry s father  it is a letter from school 
it says you haven t been there in months 
in months 
 henry s mother screams 
you re a bum 
want to grow up to be a bum 
 slapping and screaming 
 henry  after a while 
he was mostly pissed   
    because i hung around the cabstand 
he knew what went on there 
every once in a while i d have to take
a beating  but by then  i didn t care 
the way i saw it   
    everybody takes a beating sometime 
i can t make any more deliveries 
what  you will fuck everything up 
my dad says he will kill me  look 
come with me 
   tony  is that him there 
   henry  no 
   ronnie  how about him 
   henry  no 
   henry  that is the guy   
   ronnie  get him 
 tony  excuse me 
   tony  scumbag 
   wiseguy  come here  you piece of shit 
 smashing 
   tuddy  know this kid 
   mailman  yeah 
   tuddy  know where he lives 
   mailman  yeah 
   tuddy  you deliver mail to his house 
   mailman  yeah 
 tuddy  from now on  any letter from
school to his house comes directly here 
understand 
 tuddy  another letter from school
goes to that kid s house   
   in the oven you will go  head first 
 henry  that was it  no more letters from
truant officers  no letters from school 
in fact  no more letters from anybody 
after a few weeks  my mother went
to the post office to complain 
how could i go to school after that   
    and pledge allegiance and sit through
good government bullshit 
 rain pelting 
 henry  paulie hated phones 
he wouldn t have one in his house 
 tuddy  mickey called 
want me to call him back 
 paul  all right  make the call 
 henry  he got all his calls second hand 
then you d have to call the people back 
 tuddy  got a nickel 
get him on the phone 
 henry  there were guys  that is all they
did all day  was take care of paulie s calls 
 scattered conversation 
pop tune plays in background 
for a guy who moved all day long   
    paulie didn t talk to six people 
with union problems   
    or a beef in the numbers   
    only the top guys spoke
with paulie about the problem 
everything was one on one 
paulie hated conferences 
he didn t want anybody
hearing what he said   
    or anyone listening to
what he was being told 
hundreds of guys depended on him  and
he got a piece of everything they made 
it was a tribute  like in the old country 
except they were doing it in america 
all they got from paulie was protection
from the guys trying to rip them off 
that is what it is all about  that is
what the fbi could never understand 
what paulie and the organization does   
    is protect people who can t
go to the cops  that is it 
they re like the police department
for wiseguys 
 smashing  glass shattering 
 henry  people looked at me differently 
and they knew i was with somebody 
i didn t have to wait in line at the bakery
on sunday morning for fresh bread 
the owner knew who i was with  and no
matter how many people were waiting   
    i was taken care of first 
our neighbors stopped parking in
our driveway  even though we had no car 
 henry  at 13   
    i was making more money than most
of the grown ups in the neighborhood 
i had it all 
 roaring explosion 
 henry  one day   
one day  some neighborhood kids carried
my mother s groceries all the way home 
you know why 
it was out of respect 
what do you think 
 henry  aren t my shoes great 
you look like a gangster 
 yells  they shot me  help 
 tuddy  henry  shut the door 
 henry  that was the first time
i had ever seen anyone shot 
can t have that in here  jesus christ 
 tuddy  i can t have that in this joint 
 henry  i remember feeling bad
about the guy  but also   
    feeling maybe tuddy was right 
i knew paulie didn t want
anyone dying in the building 
you re a real jerk  you wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy 
what is wrong with you 
i got to toughen this kid up 
    upbeat pop tune plays  background    
 henry  it was a glorious time 
and wiseguys were all over the place 
it was before appalachian
and before crazy joe   
    decided to take on
a boss and start a war 
it was when i met the world 
and it was when
i first met jimmy conway 
he couldn t have been more than 28 or 29
at the time  but he was already a legend 
he d walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild 
he d give a doorman  100
just for opening the door 
he d give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games 
the bartender got  100 just
for keeping the ice cubes cold 
 jimmy  the irishman is here
to take you guineas  money 
   paul  want a drink 
   jimmy  give me a seven and seven 
 paul  i d like you to meet the kid henry 
how you doing 
thank you 
keep them coming 
 henry  jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city 
he was first locked up at 11 
and doing hits for mob bosses at 16 
hits never bothered jimmy 
it was business 
but what jimmy really loved to do   
what he really loved to do was steal 
he actually enjoyed it 
jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in movies 
give me your wallet 
you might know who we are 
but we know who you are 
 henry  he was one of the city s
biggest hijackers   
    of booze  cigarettes  razor blades 
shrimp and lobsters 
shrimp and lobsters were best 
they went fast 
almost all of them were gimmies 
they just gave it up  no problem 
they called him jimmy the gent 
 jimmy  help the lady 
 henry  drivers loved him 
they used to tip him off   
    about the really good loads 
of course  everybody got a piece 
 school guard 
thanks  i will be back for the rest later 
henry  come here 
say hello to tommy 
you re going to be working together  okay 
help him  go ahead 
jimmy  you got anything good 
 henry  when the cops assigned a whole
army to stop jimmy  what did he do 
he made them partners 
i d complain  but who d listen 
   henry  what do you need 
   cigarette buyer  1  two luckys 
   tommy  here you go  henry 
   henry  thanks a lot 
   henry  what do you need

i m not mad  i m proud of you 
you took your first pinch like a man   
   and learned the two greatest things
in life 
what 
 jimmy  look at me 
never rat on your friends   
   and always keep your mouth shut 
 tony  here he is 
you broke your cherry 
 shouting and applause 
 tony  congratulations 
    pop ballad begins 
sometimes    
    i    
    wonder    
    why i spend    
    the lonely night    
    dreaming of you so    
    the melody was my reverie    
    and i am once again with you    
    ballad continues in background    
 henry  by the time i grew up 
there was 30 billion a year in cargo   
    moving through idlewild airport 
and we tried to steal every bit of it 
see  we grew up near the airport 
it belonged to paulie  we had friends
and relatives who worked all over it 
they would tip us off about what
was coming in and moving out 
if any truckers or airlines gave us trouble   
    paulie s union people scared them
with a strike  it was beautiful 
it was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and jimmy was in charge 
whenever we needed money 
we d rob the airport 
to us  it was better than citibank 
 truck driver  you got a phone 
come on 
two niggers just stole my truck 
can you fucking believe that shit 
 henry  there was jimmy and tommy   
    and me 
and there was anthony stabile 
frankie carbone 
and then there was mo black s brother 
fat andy 
and his guys  frankie the wop   
    and freddy no nose 
and then there was pete the killer 
who was sally balls  brother 
then you had nickey eyes   
    and mikey franzese 
jimmy two times  nicknamed
because he said everything twice 
i will get the papers  get the papers

 henry 
for us  to live any other way was nuts 
to us  those goody good people who
worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks   
    and took the subway to work and
worried about bills  were dead 
they were suckers  they had no balls 
if we wanted something  we just took it 
if anyone complained twice  they got
hit so bad they never complained again 
it was all just routine 
you didn t even think about it 
 tommy  frankie  what the fuck does 520

    pop tune plays  background    
also  paulie could do anything 
like run up bills on the joint s credit 
and why not 
nobody will pay for it anyway 
take deliveries at the front door
and sell it out the back at a discount 
take a  200 case of booze
and sell it for  100 
it doesn t matter  it is all profit 
then finally  when there is nothing left   
    when you can t borrow
another buck from the bank   
    you bust the joint out 
you light a match 
 henry  do you need help

good  you might prefer manischewitz 
but it d look funny on my table 
 tommy chuckles 
   henry  ready 
   tommy  lighten up 
we just got here  what are you doing 
 karen  before it was time to go 
he was pushing me into the car   
    then pulling me out  it was ridiculous 
diane and tommy made us promise
to meet them again on friday 
we agreed 
but when friday came around 
henry stood me up 
i feel terrible  i don t know where he is 
he really liked you 
all he did was talk about her 
 karen  we were a trio
instead of a double date 
he should have called 
i hope it is nothing serious 
 karen  but i made tommy take me
looking for him 
 tires squeal 
 henry  tommy  what the fuck 
you got some nerve standing me up 
 karen  nobody does that to me 
who do you think you are 
frankie valli or some big shot 
 wiseguys laugh 
i forgot  i thought it was next week 
it was this friday and you agreed 
so you re a liar 
we can talk about this 
talk to you after what you just did to me 
 karen  forget it 
i thought you would stand me up 
you looked bored  you didn t say anything 
 henry  let me make it up to you

 henry  i remember  she was screaming
on the street and i mean loud 
   henry  but she looked good 
   karen  i will think about it

    op tune plays  background    
 henry  see you later 
 karen  you re leaving your car 
 henry  he watches the car for me 
it is easier than leaving it at a garage 
it is a lot quicker that way 
i like going in this way 
it is better than waiting in line 
 henry  how are you doing

   henry  how are you doing  gino 
   gino  good  how are you 
 henry  every time i come here

    he kissed me in a way    
    that i ve never been kissed before    
    he kissed me in a way    
    that i want to be kissed forever more

 tires screech 
 karen  we weren t married
to nine to five guys 
but the first time i realized how different   
    was when mickey had a hostess party 
   mother  karen  where you from 
   karen  lawrence 
on the island  nice 
i m from miami  ever been there 
it is okay  but it is like you died
and woke up in jew heaven 
stop picking at that 
i d like to smack his face 
the red haired guy 
the guy s hands are all over me 
so i told him   keep your fucking hands
off me  or i will cut them off  
 guests laugh 
she means it 
he is lucky  i just mention this to vinnie   
how can you mention it  vinnie d kill him 
vinnie will kill the miserable bastard 
then he will be there for life 
talk about problems 
what about jeannie s kid 
he was in an argument  a  10 card game 
he pulls out a gun 
 mickey  the gun goes off  some kid gets
killed  when the grandmother hears   
   she has a heart attack and drops dead 
now jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor 
   paul s wife  jeannie drinks 
   susan  maybe she is depressed 
give me a break  she is drunk 
as soon as something happens 
you make them out to be saints 
 karen  they had bad skin and wore too
much makeup  they didn t look very good 
they looked beat up 
and the stuff they wore   
    was thrown together and cheap 
a lot of pantsuits and double knits 
she spends her life in a nightgown 
the woman is no angel  believe me 
 karen  they talked about their rotten kids   
    and about beating them
with broom handles and belts 
and the kids still didn t listen 
when henry picked me up  i was dizzy 
i don t know if i could live like that 
god forbid  what would happen
if you had to go to prison 
mickey said that jeannie s husband   
do you know why jeannie s
husband went to the can 
because he wanted to get away from her 
let me tell you something 
nobody goes to jail unless they want to 
unless they make themselves get caught 
they don t have things organized 
i know what i m doing 
you know who goes to jail  nigger
stickup men  know why they get caught 
because they fall asleep
in the getaway car 
come on  don t worry so much  sweetie 
come here 
 karen  after a while 
it got to be all normal 
none of it seemed like crimes 
henry was just enterprising 
he and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys   
    sat on their asses waiting for handouts 
our husbands weren t brain surgeons 
just blue collar guys   
the only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners 
where is the strong box  you varmint 
don t fucking move  don t move 
   anthony  see you at the diner 
   tommy  i m riding shotgun 
 henry  did you see him give it right over 
 tommy  back to the hideout
to split up the loot 
 gunshots 
 henry yells and laughs 
 karen  we were all very close 
there were never any outsiders around 
absolutely never 
being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal 
 silvestri  police 
 deacy  i m detective deacy 
this is detective silvestri 
we have a search warrant 
would you read and sign it 
anywhere 
 deacy  we have to go through everything 
 karen  you want some coffee 
 deacy  no coffee now  thanks 
   karen  be careful 
   deacy  we will just go about our business 
 karen  there was always
a little harassment 
they wanted to talk to henry
about this or that 
they d make me sign
their subpoenas or warrants 
but mostly they just wanted a handout 
a few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found 
    al jolson sings on tv    
i always asked if they wanted coffee 
some wives  like mickey conway   
    used to curse at them
and spit on the floor 
on her own floor 
that never made any sense to me 
it was better to be polite
and call the lawyer 
    song on tv  don t cry 
pretty  don t cry    
    goodbye  tootsie  goodbye    
    group sings in unison 
happy birthday to you    
 karen  we always did everything together
and were always in the same crowd 
anniversaries  christenings 
we only went to each other s houses 
the women played cards 
when kids were born  mickey and
jimmy were the first at the hospital 
when we went to the islands
or vegas for vacation   
    we went together 
no outsiders ever  it got to be normal 
i began to be proud that my husband
was willing to risk his neck   
    to get us the little extras 
 karen  but i got mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night 
   henry  can t do it 
   karen  why not

 henry  for most of the guys 
killings were accepted 
murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line

everybody knew the rules 
sometimes  even if people didn t
get out of line  they got whacked 
hits became a habit 
guys would argue over nothing 
before you knew it  one was dead 
they were shooting each other
all the time 
shooting people was a normal thing 
it was no big deal 
we had a serious problem with billy batts 
this was really a touchy thing 
tommy killed a made guy 
batts was part of the gambino crew
and considered untouchable 
before you touched a made guy 
you needed a good reason 
you had to get an okay   
    or you d get whacked

 henry 
in prison  dinner was always a big thing 
we had a pasta course 
then we had a meat or a fish 
paulie did the prep work 
he was doing a year for contempt   
    and had a wonderful system for garlic 
he used a razor and sliced it so thin   
    it would liquefy in the pan
with a little oil 
it was a very good system 
vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce 
 vinnie  get that smell 
three kinds of meat in the meatballs 
veal  beef  and pork 
 jimmy  you got to have pork 
 vinnie  that is the flavor 
 henry  i felt he used too many onions 
but it was still a very good sauce 
don t put too many onions in the sauce 
 vinnie  i didn t put
too much onions in  paul 
 vinnie  there are only three small onions 
 johnny  three onions 
how many tomatoes 
   vinnie  two big cans 
   johnny  you don t need three onions 
 henry  johnny dio did the meat 
we had no broiler 
so he did everything in pans 
it smelled up the joint and
the hacks used to die   
    but he cooked a great steak 
   johnny  how do you like yours 
   vinnie  medium rare 
 johnny  medium rare  an aristocrat 
 henry  when you think of prison
you get pictures in your mind   
    of all those old movies with rows
and rows of guys behind bars 
it wasn t like that for wiseguys 
it wasn t bad  but i missed jimmy 
who was doing his time in atlanta 
 johnny  give me two steaks 
 henry  everyone else in the joint
was doing real time  all together   
    living like pigs 
but we lived alone  we owned the joint 
 johnny  we batted them sons of bitches 
you couldn t recognize them 
 vinnie  they deserved it 
even the hacks we couldn t bribe
wouldn t rat on the guys we did 
 johnny  people used to be able
to leave their doors open 
sorry it took so long 
that skinny guard is a pain in the ass 
 paul  we have to take care

 tires screech 
    piano pop melody plays in background    
 henry  jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery   
    but it had nothing to do with me 
i gave jimmy the tip and he gave me
some christmas money 
from then on  i kept my mouth shut 
i knew jimmy  he had the cash 
it was his 
he kicked some money upstairs to paulie 
but that was it 
it made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it 
he d rather whack them  what did i care 
i wasn t asking for anything 
and jimmy was making nice money
through my pittsburgh connections 
still  months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over 
    melody continues  background    
when they found carbone
in the meat truck  he was frozen so stiff   
    it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy 
still  i never saw jimmy so happy 
he was like a kid  we had money
coming in through pittsburgh   
    and even after a while 
the lufthansa thing began to calm down 
jimmy was so happy that morning   
    because this was the day
tommy was being made 
jimmy was so excited 
you d think he was being made 
he must have made four calls
to tommy s house 
they had a signal set up so he d know
the minute the ceremony was over 
   tommy  ma  where are you 
   mother  here i am 
  you re home 
  home  i m leaving 
  you look lovely 
  i look good  huh 
you look wonderful  be careful 
congratulations 
i love you  don t paint
any more religious pictures  please 
 mother  god be with you 
 henry  we always called each other
goodfellas 
you d say to somebody 
 you will like this guy  he is all right 
he is a goodfellas  one of us   
you understand 
we were goodfellas  wiseguys 
but jimmy and i could never be made
because we had irish blood 
it didn t matter my mother was sicilian 
to become a member of a crew
you must be 100 percent italian   
    so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country 
it is the highest honor they can give you 
it means you belong
to a family and a crew 
it means nobody can fuck around with you 
also  you can fuck around with anybody 
as long as they aren t also a member 
it is like a license to steal 
a license to do anything 
 tommy  how many years
since you were made 
 vinnie  i m an old timer  thirty years ago 
 tommy  brings back a lot of memories 
pike s peak was a pimple then  wasn t it 
 henry  as far as jimmy was concerned 
with tommy being made   
    it was like we were all being made 
we would now have
one of our own as a member 
 gunshot 
   jimmy  who is this 
   vinnie  this is vinnie 
 jimmy  what happened 
did we get straightened out 
 vinnie  we had a problem 
we tried to do everything we could 
you know what i mean  he is gone 
and we couldn t do nothing about it 
 jimmy  what do you mean 
 vinnie  he is gone  he is gone 
that is it 
 banging 
i knew it 
i can t fucking believe it 
   jimmy  they fucking whacked him 
   henry  fuck 
 banging 
 jimmy sobs 
are you all right 
 henry  it was revenge for billy batts 
and a lot of other things 
 vinnie  that is that 
 henry  there was nothing
we could do about it 
batts was a made man and tommy wasn t 
we had to sit still and take it 
it was among the italians 
it was real grease ball shit 
 jimmy sobs 
 henry  they even shot tommy
in the face   
    so his mother couldn t give him
an open coffin at the funeral 
 henry sighs 
 henry sniffs 
    upbeat rock song plays  background    
 helicopter propellers pelt

 henry  i had a busy day 
i had to drop the guns off at jimmy s   
    to match some silencers he had 
i had to pick up my brother
at the hospital   
    and pick up some stuff for lois   
    to fly down to some customers i had
near atlanta 
    song continues

i kept looking out the window
and saw that the helicopter was gone 
michael  keep an eye on the sauce

he was in the drug deals with me   
    paulie would have jimmy whacked
even before me

 henry sighs

how is he doing 
he is okay 
they sobered him up 
good  glad to hear it 
what kind of questions they been asking 
 karen  i don t know 
i got my mind on so many other things 
i got no money 
the girls are old enough

as soon as you talk to him 
he has got to call me  it is important 
he doesn t know i came here to see you

 engine revs 
 tires squeal 
karen  karen

 karen   sobs  nothing 
   henry  what happened 
   karen  i just got scared 
 henry  got the keys 
what happened 
 sobs  i just got scared  it is okay 
  are you all right 
  yeah 
 karen sobs 
 henry  if you re part of a crew nobody
ever tells you they re going to kill you 
it doesn t happen that way 
there aren t any arguments
or curses like in the movies 
your murderers come with smiles 
they come as your friends 
people who cared for you all your life 
they always seem to come when you re
weakest and most in need of their help 
so i met jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew 
i got there 15 minutes early
and jimmy was already there 
he took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up 
he wanted to make sure i wasn t tailed 
he was jumpy  he hadn t touched a thing 
on the surface 
everything was supposed to be fine 
we were supposed to be discussing
my case 
but i had a feeling jimmy was trying
to sense if i d rat on him to save my neck 
i been telling you your whole life 
don t talk on the phone 
now you understand 
it is going to be okay 
you got a good chance to beat this case 
well  you know that kid from the city
we were talking about  you know 
the kid turned out to be a rat  as soon
as he got pinched  he ratted on everybody 
i know where he is  he is hiding out 
know what i m saying 
would you have a problem going
with anthony to take care of that 
no  not at all 
that way they got nothing 
 henry  jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before 
but now he is asking me to go to florida
and do a hit with anthony 
that is when i knew i would never
have come back from florida alive 
 henry clears his throat 
wherever you move me 
i asked once and i will tell you again   
   i don t want to go any place cold 
you don t have a choice 
come on  whoever fucking controls it   
   just no place cold  do that for me 
he has bronchial  that is why 
if he has bronchial we will consider that 
i d like to go someplace not cold 
can i ask you some questions 
what about my parents 
what about them 
am i going to see them 
am i going to talk to them 
don t i have some kind of contact
with them 
no 
wait a minute  wait a minute 
you mean to tell me   
   if something happens to my parents
and they get sick  i can t see them 
maybe something can be worked out
if they re sick 
if there are extraordinary circumstances   
i can t do this  i can t do this  henry 
i can t leave my parents 
 henry  karen  i told you before 
i m not going to do this unless
you and the kids come with me 
i can t do it without you 
so you do whatever  but    that is it 
   karen  you need henry  not me  right 
   edward  that is right 
i don t care whether you go or not 
if it will make him a better witness 
i want you with him 
they don t want me 
 edward  henry will be in the protection
program  they can t get to him 
they can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids 
if he goes into the program
you re in danger 
   karen  i don t know anything 
   edward  don t give me   
   the babe in the woods routine 
i ve listened to those wiretaps
and i ve heard you talk about cocaine 
 edward  conversation after conversation
you talked to henry on the phone 
it doesn t matter 
whether he goes to jail   
   or stays on the streets  he is a dead man 
he knows it and you know it 
 henry  what about the kids and school 
 karen  i mean  what goes on 
 tuddy  go to wall street
and get real crooks 
whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor 
what it comes down to is
we re your only salvation 
we will save your life  his life 
and we will keep you out of jail 
 edward  this morning you told the jury
about your background 
 henry  it was easy for us to disappear 
my house was in my mother in law s name 
my cars were registered to my wife 
my social security cards
and driver s licenses were phonies 
i never voted or paid taxes 
my birth certificate and arrest sheet
were all that showed i was alive 
 edward  do you see him here
in this courtroom 
yes 
 edward  will you please point him
out for the jury 
 edward  let the record show that mr  hill
identified the defendant  james conway 
 edward  do you also know a man
named paul cicero 
   edward  is he in the courtroom 
   henry  yes 
 edward  can you point him out
for the jury 
 edward  let the record show mr  hill
identified the defendant paul cicero 
 edward  i have a document   
 henry  the hardest thing was
leaving the life 
i still loved the life 
we were treated like movie stars
with muscle  we had it all 
our wives  mothers  kids 
everybody rode along 
i had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen 
i had a bowl of coke next to my bed 
 hayes  people call them rats because
they will do anything to survive 
   edward  objection 
   judge  objection sustained 
   henry  i know nothing about being a rat 
   hayes  you know everything about it 
 henry  anything i wanted was
a phone call away 
free cars  keys to a dozen hideouts
all over the city 
i d bet 20 grand over a weekend   
    then blow the winnings in a week
or go to sharks to pay the bookies 
didn t matter 
it didn t mean anything  when i was broke
i would go rob some more 
we ran everything 
we paid off cops  we paid off lawyers 
we paid off judges 
everybody had their hands out 
everything was for the taking 
and now it is all over 
 henry  that is the hardest part 
today everything is different 
there is no action  i have to wait around
like everyone else 
can t even get decent food 
after i got here i ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce   
    and i got egg noodles and ketchup
