why that hospital

didn t survive
the fiscal cut this afternoon

about how disappointed i am 
i was explaining to frank   
that there simply wasn t
money in the budget   
to fund that facility 
in a city
of twelve million people   
i find that hard to believe 
i hoped we could do better 
i hoped so  too  frank   
but there simply was
no money in the budget 
if you think it s so easy   
why don t you try
funding it yourself

how about sixteen million

this man s legal advisor

cut it  bag it 
and sell it on the street   
for a hundred twenty 
a hundred fifty a gram 
that s a hundred fifty thousand
dollars a key   
five times what they paid you 
so now your quintal s worth
fifteen million dollars   
a markup of
eleven million something   
that you get no part of 
i know you don t
have the manpower   
to peddle
the uptown streets  but i do 
you put up the stuff 
i put up the guys to sell it 
i take the heat
and the risk   
if there is any 
we divide the difference   
setting aside something
for places like this 
what do you say 
if i was into
socialized medicine   
i would have stayed
in the peking province 
i want cash for my goods 
how much 
three million up front   
iike you said   
with another half a mil
when you unload it 
that s a lot of money 
i got a lot of shit 
make up your mind 
you know something  frank 
this conversation
made me realize   
just how fucking crazy
you really are 
it s all set up 
i don t think you should
go down there alone 
i don t trust
that crazy chinese guy 
know what i mean 
it s enrico mata 
they got him recovering
in a hospital somewhere   
with a police guard
around him 24 hours 
he s agreed to testify
for them in court 
they got jump cold
this time  frank 
it s murder one 
did abe get them set bail 
a million dollars apiece 
so go sign him out 
posting that kind
of money s gonna raise   
more problems
than it solves  frank 
also  i want you to get abe   
to talk to some of
those friends of his   
see if they can t get
this cop transferred   
or retired or something 
i want him out of my way 
he s chief
investigating officer   
on a multiple homicide 
it s stupid
to even think about it 
ask him   
before i blow bishop s brains
all over his fucking wing tips 
get some guys and pick him up 
you got it  frank 
hope you had a good time
