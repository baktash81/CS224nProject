about how disappointed i am
i was explaining to frank
that there simply wasnt
money in the budget
to fund that facility
in a city
of twelve million people
i find that hard to believe
i hoped we could do better
i hoped so too frank
but there simply was
no money in the budget
if you think its so easy
why dont you try
funding it yourself

how about sixteen million
by the end of the quarter

i take the heat
and the risk
if there is any
we divide the difference
setting aside something
for places like this

socialized medicine
i would have stayed
in the peking province
i want cash for my goods

those friends of his
see if they cant get
this cop transferred
or retired or something
