asshole youre not supposed

where it gets you
yeah
you all right
what did i say
freshman orientation week
i said
no drinkin on my campus
i dont know why
no one called my attention
to your file before
i mean all these complaints
about you
physically assaulting
a student
and have you really been
pulling people over
on the highway
um yes sir i have
i figured that if you do
the drunk tests on the road
trouble never gets
to the campus
we dont have any jurisdiction
on the highway
and i realize that
but i believe
in law and order sir
you cant have a country
without it
hmm and you were dismissed
from the habersham county
sheriffs office
i dont want
any mickeymousin
on these grounds
isnt that what you said
when did i say that
you said it at founders day
last year i believe
you were by the punch bowl
i walked up to you
and you said to me
uh uh
well i had interrupted you
i apologized
i introduced myself
and i said i was
gonna be the greatest
campus security guard
you ever had
and you said thats good
i dont want
any mickeymousin
on this campus
i think i mightve
even wrote it down
i write down most things
i keep the important ones
and i believe
oh yes sir
i dont want
any mickeymousin
on these grounds
those are your words sir
so i took it seriously
and now
my question for you is
what about these kids
in the dormitory
drinkin and all that
what you gonna do about that
were just gonna let it slide
do you wanna resign
or would it be better
if i fired you
gunshot
so im goin
into this guys office
and i think that
hes bringing me in there
cause hes gonna you know
give me some commendation
or a promotion or something
come to find out he brought me
in there to fire me

i just
i see the attention
hes getting
its the kind of attention
he was always seeking here
harassing students pulling
people over on the highway

theyre making him out to be
and i had information
pertinent to the fact
which i failed
to bring to light
it could jeopardize lives

the right thing in calling us

who then discovered it
and the fires in idaho
this summer
started by a firefighter
who wanted the credit
for putting them out
a profile emerges here
the false hero
in interviews
jewells account
of the bombing seems vague
and he looks uncomfortable
discussing the victims
i also found
that his mentioning on tv
that he wanted to get back
into law enforcement a bit
inappropriate
theres a lot here
thats troubling
and everything that agent shaw
has learned about him
syncs up with this profile
you agree with that tom
yes sir i do
lets put eyes on him
nadya watson
yeah
watson
yeah
you have a call on line one
is it bill gates
randomly wondering
if i need a million dollars
if so thats an affirmative
its richard jewell
richard jewell

thank you sir
how are you
hows your family

i see youve moved up
from video games
yep i didnt mean to
but i guess i did
good job
thats a prideful thing
what can i do you for
oh sir i was calling you
because i wanted to know
have you ever done
a book deal
stammers why
with this whole bomb thing
i got these new york guys
who are asking me
to write a book
and i dont really know
anything about that
so i thought
maybe i could call you
you might be able to help me
sure sounds
a little farfetched
but contracts are contracts
but yeah we could talk
so are you not
the us small business
admin anymore
cause i tried there first
no i moved on
oh how come
lifestyle decision
whats your phone number
my phone number is 404

8188
8188
all right well
you just dont sign anything
until i see it first
well start there
yes sir
yeah i wont put a pen
to the page ill wait on it
hey and thank you sir
thank you for your time
you got it
all right bye
stay in touch
yes sir
okay
bye
no no
dont get too excited
no
yes
no simmer down there
hot sauce
bobi well bill miller
its nice to see you
its been a while
its nice to see you bobi
wheres the hero
oh hes in here come on in
bill what kind of charge
you figure it was
richard hmm
im not sure what kinda
explosive the guy used
it could have been
black powder match heads
maybe some kinda chlorate
packed with nails
you know the funny thing is
the package was supposed
to blow out right
so when those drunks
those kids knocked it over
they saved a bunch of lives
because it was supposed
to blow out
into a crowd
for maximum casualties
but when they knocked it
on its back it blew upward
most of the ordnance
going up into the sky
it blew up so
all in all
what youre looking at
is some kind of battery
and some kind of
timing device
like a simple clock
maybe a wristwatch
like im wearing
depends how hightech
the guy got
some of these guys
especially if theyre
exmilitary
or theyre some kind of whiz
outta some university
theyre gonna use
a combination
of different bomb tactics
other people are following it
like a recipe
theyre probably
losing a finger to it
bill yeah
but depends on who
youre talking about
and whos making the bomb
well sighs
i like getting your opinion
on it
and im sure
youve studied it quite a bit
who knows i mean
thats the thing too
about these bombers
it could have been you or me
these guys some of them
look like regular people
lot of them do
yeah
slow dance music playing
on speakers
indistinct chatter
kathy sighs
must be a lot of pressure
on you guys
no more so than usual
sure just another
thank you
just your average
deadly bombing
on us soil
during the olympics
no big deal
i dont know you guys must be
feeling the heat too huh
kathy mmmhmm
cnn is going walltowall
with this
is that why we get this
outfit
chuckles
so then give me something
i can print
kathy you know
i cant do that
thats all right
i already know
the bureaus looking
into somebody
yeah what makes
you think that
friends
friends
sources
sources
who is it
well kathy if you couldnt
fuck it out of them
what makes you think
youre gonna fuck it outta me
scoffing
uhhuh
you know what
bothers me kathy
is that people dont
understand how much work
goes into making
a case like this
its effort 247
kathy hmm
youre right
why dont you educate me
i will not have this
screwed up
that was a massacre out there
its a miracle
more people werent killed
i would never go
to print without
independent corroboration
from a second source
and that would put us
in a very different zone
as you know
really
mmmhmm
what kind of zone
you have to find out
sighs
softly were looking at
the security guard jewell
no shit
no shit
you always look at the guy
who found the bomb just like
you always look at the guy
who found the body
but this guy
hes got a bad past
fits the profile
of the herobomber to a t
that fat fuck who lives
with his mother of course
how did i miss that
i mean that is amazing
oof

richard jewell 33
a former
law enforcement officer
the story goes on to say
fits the profile
of the lone bomber
this profile
generally includes
a frustrated white man who
is a former police officer
member of the military
or police wannabe
who seeks to become a hero
the security guard who first
alerted police
to the pipe bomb
that exploded
in centennial olympic park
tom so up until
it obviously went sideways
everything pretty normal
about that evening right
no it was a regular night
from what i could tell
everyone was having
a great time
it was like a celebration
tom yeah no air of
yeah you were having fun
i was having fun
it was a good time
but there was uh some guys
with beer cans
or something like that
guys behind the tower
what were they doing there
they were throwing
beer bottles
beer bottles yeah
they were horsing around
fooling
i broke it up
and i gave em a talkingto
and they left yep
dan and that was
behind the tower
yes sir
right
so then you came back
around the tower
and thats where you saw
the package unattended
yes sir
tom right
dan and did you see anyone
walking away from the bench
no sir i wouldve
tailed them if i did
yeah
so you have no idea who might
have put that package there
no sir
but whoever did
i think they ought to fry
oh yeah we think so
too richard
absolutely
so heres what
were gonna do
were trying to be
as authentic as possible
and part of that has to do
with how you treat a suspect
all right so
what were gonna do is
were gonna pretend
that we actually brought
you in in that regard
right
that
and we read you
your miranda rights
and youve agreed
to waive them
in fact we have
a form you can sign
dan yeah why dont you
thisll be good
just so it looks real
yeah so you just sign
the bottom there
and well get that on tape
and then well continue on
with the interview
okay

im sorry richard
maybe i wasnt clear
you actually have to
physically sign the paper
this is a real document
dan well
of course were going for
authenticity here richard
it has to be real
for the video

what were gonna do now is
agent bennets gonna
come back in the room
hes gonna
reintroduce himself
show you his credentials just
like a professional interview
and then were gonna
actually read you
your miranda rights
why would he do that
tom well to make it
more authentic richard
we want this to look
as authentic as possible
come on in agent bennet

of the park for a while
male reporter
well be checking back
right now were gonna
throw it back to
nbc news and tom brokaw
richard panting
the speculation
is that the fbi
is close to making the case
in their language
they probably have enough
to arrest him right now
probably enough
to prosecute him
but you always wanna have
enough to convict him as well
there are still some holes
in this case

say that about you
male reporter
that was tom brokaw
with the latest update on
the centennial park bombing
phone continues ringing

youll be fine
mr jewells attorney
mr bryant
thanks for coming in
youre welcome
what are the authorities
telling you
about their suspicions
about your client
uh nothing
no communication whatsoever
uh all theyve said
to me is that
theyre not going to
arrest him
thats what
they told me yesterday
you believe that
no
you think they are going
to arrest him
i dont think theyd tell me
whether they were
or they werent thats all
what do you think
of the manner
in which the fbi
has treated your client
pursuing this investigation
i think whoever the bum was
that leaked
that richard jewell
was the focus
of this investigation
he deserves to be prosecuted
or dealt with
in some serious way
i dont think
that this investigation
should be conducted
under world spotlight
if you will like this
whats your client told you
about this cabin
thats being searched today
its his former residence
as i understand it
you need
to understand something
i have barely had the time
to take a breath in this case
since it started
the other night
we have been reacting
to the media to the fbi
and i have not sat down
and conducted
an indepth interview
about all these things that
yall are asking me about
then why are you so convinced
of his innocence
because ive known richard
for a while
ive looked him in the eye and
ive asked him the question
but youve admitted to me
you didnt even know
he had a cabin
you didnt know
about this prior arrest
you didnt know
about the prior misdemeanors
theres a whole lot of priors
you didnt know about
i have not conducted
a thorough investigation
into richards history
no i understand all that
i guess what im asking you is
considering that
you havent done that
and considering there are
things that you didnt know
why are you so convinced
of his innocence
because i believe him
plain and simple
yeah thats right
i dont know
a whole lot of things
about a whole lot of people
that i know
i dont have richards police
records you may i dont
i have not gotten up to speed
on some things thats all
but just because
i dont know these things
doesnt mean
that i dont have a feel
for where i think
richard is in this case
were you aware that the
habersham sheriffs department
had asked him to seek
psychological counseling
i dont know that either
but i know a lot of people
who ought to have
psychological counseling
watson bryant
i thank you very much
see ya thank you
twentytwo past the hour
well be right back
bill campbell on tv

next to me is bobi jewell
camera shutters clicking
mother of richard jewell
by some savage twist of fate
richard jewell
has been wrongfully
and falsely accused
of murder and mayhem
her sons accusers
are two of the most powerful
forces in the world today
the united states government
and the media
for the past four weeks
these horrific forces
have combined
to make her daily existence
a living hell
as i speak
they continue to crush
the very life out of her
and her only son
i introduce barbara jewell
the 113th victim
of the centennial bombing
bobi clears throat
my name is barbara jewell
i am employed
as a claims coordinator
with a local insurance agency
and i have worked there
for 13 years
approximately four weeks ago
over 100 people were injured
and two people
lost their lives
as a result
of the olympic park bombing
my heart goes out to these
victims and their families
i am so very drained
i hope and pray to god
that nobody ever has to
go through this again
i do not think any of you
can even begin to imagine
what our lives are like
the media
has portrayed my son
as the person
who has committed this crime
they have taken
all privacy from us
they have taken all peace
they watch and photograph
everything we do
like the media
the fbi follows his every move
and watches
my home constantly
and why
voice breaks my son
my son is innocent
richard is not
the olympic park bomber
richard is not a murderer
he saved peoples lives
please hear me mr president
and help me
you have the power
to end this nightmare
my son is a hero
i think the fbi
knows that by now
if they do not intend
to charge my son
please tell us
please tell the world
mr president
crying
please clear my sons name
watson softly okay
bobi sniffles
continues crying
you did good
bobi richard

if hes got any snickers
kinda hungry
richard sighs
you know what
a 1001 is radar
yes sir
its lying to a federal agent
its a felony
you say anything in there
that isnt true
they can put you in jail
without ever proving
youre a bomber
hey

you ask
for a fiveminute break
you consult with me
you do not improvise

yes sir

mr bryant

deference than theyre due
and dont keep
calling them sir
yeah well theyre still
the united states government
no they arent
the united states government
theyre just three pricks
who work for
the united states government
you understand the difference
nobody in that room
is a better man than you
you understand
come on
youll be fine
whispers thats it
sit right there
richard right here
watson yeah
watson clears throat
thank you for joining us
uh mr jewell
weve got a few questions
regarding the events
of july 27th 1996
as you probably know
specifically the bombing
in centennial park
mr jewell
you ever find yourself
accessing a internet site
called candymans candyland
regarding the contents
of the anarchist cookbook
no i have not
but you do have
police training
in handling explosives
asked and answered
did you ever collect
any pieces of pipe
from uh the construction
of centennial park
no i did not
do you remember telling
anybody at the park uh
take my picture now
because pretty soon
im gonna be famous
no sir
tom really
you sure about that
how about did you say
im on my way to atlanta
its gonna be a mess
out there
sighs i was referring
to the traffic jams
mr jewell
why specifically did
you want to be stationed
at that sound and light tower
i just liked
listening to the music
and the night before
i got to bring my mama down
we got to listen
to kenny rogers
she liked that that was nice
and i guess i also get
a nice vantage point
to take a look at
all the pretty girls
i am not a homosexual
and neither is david dutchess
so you and david dutchess
are not lovers
asked and answered
mr jewell you said before
that in your comings
and goings back and forth
from the stage to the tower
that you couldnt get uh
an exact fix on the time
is that correct
hesitates
yes but when you
have the runs
which i did excuse me
youre not thinking
about what time it is
youre just trying to
chuckles
crabwalk to a bathroom
you know
so you dont remember
the exact time
that you saw the drunks
throwing the beer cans
against the tower
right
no
you dont remember
the exact time
you first saw the backpack
thats correct
you ever seen a backpack
like that before mr jewell
yeah i suppose so yeah
you ever see that specific
backpack before mr jewell
asked and answered
can we move on
mr jewell
did you conspire with
david dutchess or anybody else
to plant a bomb
in centennial park
people screaming
women crying
panicked shouting
no
tom then how the fuck
did you know
to be on the other side
of that att tower
where you knew youd be
protected from the blast
a bomb went off right
where you were stationed
chaos erupts
bodies hit the ground
cops go flying
hell i was one of them
you come out
without a goddamn scratch
how does that happen richard
inhales scoffs softly
can i ask all you fellas
a question
jesus what
do you have any kind
of case against me
tom scoffs
i mean evidence
like any traces of anything
on my mamas tupperware
or did you find
any bombmaking materials
in her apartment
or did you find some
okay hey hey
richard we dont
need to volunteer
no im gonna say this
if im gonna say anything
i walk in here
and i look at
the circle decal
on your windows there
and im thinking
you know i used to think
that federal law enforcement
was just about
the highest calling
a person could aspire to
and im not sure i think
that anymore you know
not after all this
i did my job that night
and some people are alive
because of that
but do you think
that the next time
some security guard
sees a suspicious package
that he or shes
gonna call it in
i doubt it
you know cause
theyre gonna look at that
and theyre gonna think
i dont wanna be
another richard jewell
so im just gonna run
hows that make
anybody any safer
yall can keep following
me around some more
doing what youre doing
i can stand it
but i just know that
every second you spend on me
is time that
youre not spending
on the real guy who did it
and its like watson said
what
what happens when he
sighs
what happens when
he does it again
chuckles
so do you have anything
you wanna charge me with
tom sighs quietly
can you
sighs
well
i think its time to go
howd he do
he did great
chuckles god
