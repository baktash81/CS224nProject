where it gets you 
yeah 
you all right 
what did i say
freshman orientation week 
i said 
 no drinkin  on my campus  
i don t know why
no one called my attention
to your file before 
i mean  all these complaints
about you 
physically assaulting
a student 
and have you really been
pulling people over
on the highway 
um    yes  sir  i have 
i figured that if you do
the drunk tests on the road 
trouble never gets
to the campus 
we don t have any jurisdiction
on the highway 
and i realize that 
but i believe
in law and order  sir 
you can t have a country
without it 
hmm  and you were dismissed
from the habersham county
sheriff s office 
 i don t want
any mickey mousin 
on these grounds  
isn t that what you said 
when did i say that 
you said it at founders  day
last year  i believe 
you were by the punch bowl 
i walked up to you 
and you said to me   
uh  uh   
well  i had interrupted you 
i apologized 
i introduced myself 
and i said i was
gonna be the greatest
campus security guard
you ever had 
and you said   that s good  
 i don t want
any mickey mousin 
on this campus  
i think i might ve
even wrote it down 
i write down most things 
i keep the important ones 
and i believe   
oh  yes  sir 
 i don t want
any mickey mousin 
on these grounds  
those are your words  sir 
so  i took it seriously 
and now 
my question for you is 
what about these kids
in the dormitory 
drinkin  and all that 
what you gonna do about that 
we re just gonna let it slide 
do you wanna resign 
or would it be better
if i fired you 
 gunshot 
so  i m goin 
into this guy s office
and i think that
he s bringing me in there

give me some commendation
or a promotion or something 
come to find out he brought me
in there to fire me

the real heroes are
the paramedics

let s just catch
the son of a bitch  yeah 
yeah 
i need you to get out
to habersham county 
background on a former
sheriff s deputy 
might have some connection
to the bombing 
who is it 
the security guard 
 man  hey  richard 
 camera shutters clicking 
hey  way to go  man 
you made us all real proud 
thank you 
dr  cleere  we wanna thank you
for contacting the fbi
regarding your suspicions
about richard jewell 
i wanna be clear 
i haven t accused him
of anything 
we completely understand 
i just   
i see the attention
he s getting 
it s the kind of attention
he was always seeking here 
harassing students  pulling
people over on the highway 
just crazy behavior 
and i decided
if my fears were correct 
if he actually wasn t the hero
they re making him out to be 
and i had information
pertinent to the fact
which i failed
to bring to light   
it could jeopardize lives 
well  dr  cleere  you did
the right thing in calling us 
we will  rest assured 
follow up on this 
do you mind if we take
this folder with us 
please 
we ll make a copy
and get you the original back 
why is the goddamn acog
reopening that park 
we don t have shit 
okay  i wanna hear
more about jewell 
patrick 
well  when i look at jewell   
i think about the bomb scare
at the l a  olympics in  84 
a bag left on a bus
by the same cop
who then discovered it 
and the fires in idaho
this summer 
started by a firefighter
who wanted the credit
for putting them out 
a profile emerges here 
the false hero 
in interviews 
jewell s account
of the bombing seems vague
and he looks uncomfortable
discussing the victims 
i also found
that his mentioning on tv
that he wanted to get back
into law enforcement a bit
inappropriate 
there s a lot here
that s troubling 
and everything that agent shaw
has learned about him 
syncs up with this profile 
you agree with that  tom 
yes  sir  i do 
let s put eyes on him 
   nadya  watson 
  yeah 
  watson 
  yeah 
you have a call on line one 
is it bill gates
randomly wondering
if i need a million dollars 
if so  that s an affirmative 
it s richard jewell 
 richard jewell 
richard jewell 
 richard jewell 
richard jewell  line one 
  hello 
  mr  bryant 
hey  uh 
i m sorry to bother you 
i just got your number
from information 
i hope you remember me 
radar  you can call me watson 
you re a national hero now 
i m glad you called 
we re running out of snickers 
thank you  sir 
how are you 
how s your family 
we re all fine  yeah 
i see you ve moved up
from video games 
yep  i didn t mean to 
but i guess i did 
good job 
that s a prideful thing 
what can i do you for 
oh  sir  i was calling you
because i wanted to know 
have you ever done
a book deal 
 stammers  why 
with this whole bomb thing 
i got these new york guys
who are asking me
to write a book
and i don t really know
anything about that 
so i thought
maybe i could call you 
you might be able to help me 
sure  sounds
a little far fetched 
but contracts are contracts 
but yeah  we could talk 
so  are you not
the u s  small business
admin anymore 
 cause i tried there first 
no  i moved on 
oh  how come 
lifestyle decision 
what s your phone number 
  my phone number is 404   
  404   
  194   
  194   
  8188 
  8188 
all right  well 
you just don t sign anything
until i see it first 
we ll start there 
yes  sir 
yeah  i won t put a pen
to the page  i ll wait on it 
hey  and thank you  sir 
thank you for your time 
you got it 
all right  bye 
  stay in touch 
  yes  sir 
  okay 
  bye 
no  no 
don t get too excited 
  no 
  yes 
no  simmer down there 
hot sauce 
 bobi  well  bill miller 
it s nice to see you 
it s been a while 
it s nice to see you  bobi 
where s the hero 
oh  he s in here  come on in 
 bill  what kind of charge
you figure it was 
 richard  hmm   
i m not sure what kinda
explosive the guy used 
it could have been
black powder  match heads 
maybe some kinda chlorate
packed with nails 
you know  the funny thing is
the package was supposed
to blow out  right 
so  when those drunks 
those kids knocked it over 
they saved a bunch of lives 
because it was supposed
to blow out
into a crowd
for maximum casualties 
but when they knocked it
on its back  it blew upward 
most of the ordnance
going up into the sky 
it blew up  so   
all in all 
what you re looking at
is some kind of battery
and some kind of
timing device 
like a simple clock 
maybe a wristwatch
like i m wearing 
depends how high tech
the guy got 
some of these guys 
especially if they re
ex military 
or they re some kind of whiz
outta some university 
they re gonna use
a combination
of different bomb tactics 
other people are following it
like a recipe 
they re probably
  losing a finger to it 
   bill  yeah 
but depends on who
you re talking about
and who s making the bomb 
well     sighs 
i like getting your opinion
on it 
and i m sure
you ve studied it quite a bit 
who knows  i mean   
that s the thing  too 
about these bombers 
it could have been you or me 
these guys  some of them 
look like regular people 
lot of them do 
yeah 
 slow dance music playing
on speakers 
 indistinct chatter 
 kathy sighs 
must be a lot of pressure
on you guys 
no more so than usual 
sure  just another   
thank you 
just your average
deadly bombing
on u s  soil
during the olympics 
no big deal 
i don t know  you guys must be
feeling the heat  too  huh 
 kathy  mmm hmm 
cnn is going wall to wall
with this 
is that why we get this   
  outfit 
   chuckles 
so  then give me something
i can print 
kathy  you know
i can t do that 
that s all right 
i already know
the bureau s looking
into somebody 
yeah  what makes
you think that 
friends 
  friends 
  sources 
sources 
who is it 
well  kathy  if you couldn t
fuck it out of them 
what makes you think
you re gonna fuck it outta me 
   scoffing 
  uh huh 
you know what
bothers me  kathy 
is that people don t
understand how much work
goes into making
a case like this 
it s effort 24 7 
 kathy  hmm 
you re right 
why don t you educate me 
i will not have this
screwed up 
that was a massacre out there 
it s a miracle
more people weren t killed 
i would never go
to print without
independent corroboration
from a second source 
and that would put us
in a very different zone 
as you know 
  really 
  mmm hmm 
what kind of zone 
you have to find out 
 sighs 
 softly  we re looking at
the security guard  jewell 
  no shit 
  no shit 
you always look at the guy
who found the bomb just like
you always look at the guy
who found the body 
but this guy 
he s got a bad past 
fits the profile
of the hero bomber to a t 
that fat fuck who lives
with his mother  of course 
how did i miss that 
i mean  that is amazing 
oof 
you are good 
you re very good 
yeah 
this kind of puts a clock
on things though 
you wanna get a room
or just go to my car 
this is happening 
this is happening 
let s get the fuck outta here 
   kathy  okay

 richard jewell  33 
a former

the story goes on to say 
 fits the profile
of the lone bomber 
this profile
generally includes
a frustrated white man who
is a former police officer 
member of the military 
or police wannabe
who seeks to become a hero 
the security guard who first
alerted police
to the pipe bomb   
that exploded
in centennial olympic park  
 tom  so  up until
it obviously went sideways 
everything pretty normal
about that evening  right 
no  it was a regular night
from what i could tell 
everyone was having
a great time 
it was like a celebration 
 tom  yeah  no air of   
yeah  you were having fun 
i was having fun 
it was a good time 
but there was  uh  some guys
with beer cans
or something like that 
guys behind the tower 
what were they doing there 
they were throwing   
  beer bottles 
  beer bottles  yeah 
they were horsing around 
fooling 
i broke it up
and i gave  em a talking to 
and they left  yep 
 dan  and that was
behind the tower 
  yes  sir 
  right 
so then you came back
around the tower
and that s where you saw
the package unattended 
  yes  sir 
   tom  right 
 dan  and did you see anyone
walking away from the bench 
no  sir  i would ve
tailed them if i did 
yeah 
so  you have no idea who might
have put that package there 
no  sir 
but whoever did 
i think they ought to fry 
oh  yeah  we think so 
too  richard 
absolutely 
so  here s what
we re gonna do 
we re trying to be
as authentic as possible
and part of that has to do
with how you treat a suspect 
all right  so 
what we re gonna do is
we re gonna pretend
that we actually brought
you in  in that regard 
  right 
  that   
and we read you
your miranda rights
and you ve agreed
to waive them 
in fact  we have
a form you can sign 
 dan  yeah  why don t you    
this ll be good 
just so it looks real 
yeah  so  you just sign
the bottom there
and we ll get that on tape
and then we ll continue on
with the interview 
okay 
yeah 
i m sorry  richard 
maybe i wasn t clear 
you actually have to
physically sign the paper 
  this is a real document 
   dan  well   
of course  we re going for
authenticity here  richard 
it has to be real
for the video 
i m sorry  sir  i don t   
i don t think
i would feel comfortable
signing something like this 
richard  we just want   
you know what  why don t we
take a quick break 
  go ahead and stop the camera 
  okay 
um   
  yeah  okay 
  we ll just talk for a second 
  we ll be right back 
   dan  right back 
i was a sheriff deputy 
habersham county 
all right  richard 
we re gonna pretend like
none of that ever happened 
let s get a new tape going 
okay 
  uh   
   tape whirring 
what we re gonna do now   
there you go  i got it 
get her out there
and we ll throw it away 
what we re gonna do now is
agent bennet s gonna
come back in the room 
he s gonna
reintroduce himself 
show you his credentials just
like a professional interview
and then we re gonna
actually read you
your miranda rights 
why would he do that 
 tom  well  to make it
more authentic  richard 
we want this to look
as authentic as possible 
come on in  agent bennet 
mr  jewell   
special agent dan bennet  fbi

that bomb  richard 
what can you tell us
about the fbi interview 
richard  what did the fbi
say to you  just tell us 
 reporter on tv 
we re having some trouble
connecting to blaine scott

from him later 
 phone ringing 
he can tell us
about the traffic situation

centennial park is   
they re all after me now

of the park for a while 
 male reporter 
we ll be checking back 
right now we re gonna
throw it back to   
  nbc news and tom brokaw 
   richard panting 
the speculation
is that the fbi
is close to  making the case  
in their language 
they probably have enough
to arrest him right now 
probably enough
to prosecute him 
but you always wanna have
enough to convict him as well 
there are still some holes
in this case 
why did tom brokaw
say that about you 
 male reporter 
that was tom brokaw
with the latest update on
the centennial park bombing 
 phone continues ringing 
 female reporter

you ll be fine 
mr  jewell s attorney 
mr  bryant 
  thanks for coming in 
  you re welcome 
what are the authorities
telling you
about their suspicions
about your client 
uh  nothing 
no communication whatsoever 
uh  all they ve said
to me is that
they re not going to
arrest him 
that s what
they told me yesterday 
you believe that 
no 
you think they are going
to arrest him 
i don t think they d tell me
whether they were
or they weren t  that s all 
what do you think
of the manner
in which the fbi
has treated your client
  pursuing this investigation 
  i think whoever the bum was
that leaked
that richard jewell
was the focus
of this investigation 
he deserves to be prosecuted
or dealt with
in some serious way 
i don t think
that this investigation
should be conducted
under world spotlight 
if you will  like this 
what s your client told you
about this cabin
that s being searched today 
it s his former residence 
as i understand it 
you need
to understand something 
i have barely had the time
to take a breath in this case
since it started
the other night 
we have been reacting
to the media  to the fbi 
and i have not sat down
and conducted
an in depth interview
about all these things that
y all are asking me about 
then why are you so convinced
of his innocence 
because i ve known richard
for a while 
i ve looked him in the eye and
i ve asked him the question 
but you ve admitted to me 
you didn t even know
he had a cabin 
you didn t know
about this prior arrest 
you didn t know
about the prior misdemeanors 
there s a whole lot of priors
you didn t know about 
i have not conducted
a thorough investigation
  into richard s history 
  no  i understand all that 
i guess what i m asking you is
considering that
you haven t done that 
and considering there are
things that you didn t know 
why are you so convinced
of his innocence 
because i believe him 
plain and simple 
yeah  that s right 
i don t know
a whole lot of things
about a whole lot of people
that i know 
i don t have richard s police
records  you may  i don t   
i have not gotten up to speed
on some things  that s all 
but just because
i don t know these things
doesn t mean
that i don t have a feel
for where i think
richard is in this case 
were you aware that the
habersham sheriff s department
had asked him to seek
psychological counseling 
i don t know that either 
but i know a lot of people
who ought to have
psychological counseling 
watson bryant 
i thank you very much 
see ya  thank you 
twenty two past the hour 
we ll be right back 
 bill campbell on tv

the public that
  atlanta is a safe place

of last evening

for impersonating an officer 
yeah  once 
  it was complicated

please 
  next to me is bobi jewell   
   camera shutters clicking 
   mother of richard jewell 
by some savage twist of fate 
richard jewell
has been wrongfully
and falsely accused
of murder and mayhem 
her son s accusers
are two of the most powerful
forces in the world today 
the united states government
and the media 
for the past four weeks 
these horrific forces
have combined
to make her daily existence
a living hell 
as i speak 
they continue to crush
the very life out of her
and her only son 
i introduce barbara jewell 
the 113th victim
of the centennial bombing 
 bobi clears throat 
my name is barbara jewell 
i am employed
as a claims coordinator
with a local insurance agency 
and i have worked there
for 13 years 
approximately four weeks ago 
over 100 people were injured
and two people
lost their lives
as a result
of the olympic park bombing 
my heart goes out to these
victims and their families 
i am so very drained 
i hope and pray to god
that nobody ever has to
go through this again 
i do not think any of you
can even begin to imagine
what our lives are like 
the media
has portrayed my son   
as the person
who has committed this crime 
they have taken
all privacy from us 
they have taken all peace 
they watch and photograph
everything we do 
like the media 
the fbi follows his every move
and watches
my home constantly 
and why 
 voice breaks  my son   
my son is innocent 
richard is not
the olympic park bomber 
richard is not a murderer 
he saved people s lives 
please hear me  mr  president 
and help me 
you have the power
to end this nightmare 
my son is a hero 
i think the fbi
knows that by now 
if they do not intend
to charge my son 
please tell us 
please tell the world 
mr  president 
 crying 
please clear my son s name 
   watson  softly  okay 
   bobi sniffles 
 continues crying 
you did good 
 bobi  richard 
 richard whimpers 
oh  mama 
oh  thank you for doing that 
 shuddering 
oh  i m sorry 
i m sorry  i m sorry i cried 
i    i didn t mean to cry 
no  you did real good 
you did better than good 
you ready 
let s go show them
who you are 
oh  god 
i m so glad that s over 
you did good 
 quietly  all right 
 phone ringing 
gentlemen  please have a seat 
we ll be right with you 
 richard sighs 
 exhales 
all right  let me tell you
how it s gonna go 
they re gonna ask to see me
first  set the ground rules 
i wanna make sure
they know i m not gay 
richard  i think
we got bigger fish to fry 
but  uh  you ll get the chance
to tell them that 
i m sure 
agent shaw 
dare you to see
if he s got any snickers 
kinda hungry 
 richard sighs 
you know what
a 1001 is  radar 
yes  sir 
it s lying to a federal agent 
it s a felony 
you say anything in there
that isn t true 
they can put you in jail
without ever proving
you re a bomber 
hey 
you don t know what to say 
you say nothing 
you ask
for a five minute break 
you consult with me 
you do not improvise 
you got that 
yes  sir 
so if you don t know
what to say  what do you do 
  i don t say a damn thing 
  that s right 
mr  bryant 
 sighs heavily 
 phone rings 
can i help you 
i was taking a look 
 sighs 
how do you guys
wanna handle this 
 tom  well  we re gonna ask you
some questions 
and you re gonna
give us some answers 
how s that sound 
okay 
sounds good 
i ll go get him 
hey  you ready  boyo 
yeah 
i think so  yeah 
no  i mean ready 
look at these guys
not as suspect to agent 
but as cop to cop 
don t give them any more
deference than they re due 
and don t keep
calling them  sir  
yeah  well  they re still
the united states government 
no  they aren t
the united states government 
they re just three pricks
who work for
the united states government 
you understand the difference 
nobody in that room
is a better man than you 
you understand 
come on 
you ll be fine 
 whispers  that s it 
sit right there 
 richard  right here 
 watson  yeah 
 watson clears throat 
thank you for joining us 
uh  mr  jewell 
we ve got a few questions 
regarding the events
of july 27th  1996 
as you probably know 
specifically the bombing
in centennial park 
mr  jewell 
you ever find yourself
accessing a internet site
called candyman s candyland
regarding the contents
of the anarchist cookbook 
no  i have not 
but you do have
police training
in handling explosives 
asked and answered 
did you ever collect
any pieces of pipe
from  uh  the construction
of centennial park 
no  i did not 
do you remember telling
anybody at the park  uh 
 take my picture now 
because pretty soon
i m gonna be famous  
no  sir 
 tom  really 
you sure about that 
100  
how about  did you say 
 i m on my way to atlanta 
it s gonna be a mess
out there  
 sighs  i was referring
to the traffic jams 
mr  jewell 
why specifically did
you want to be stationed
at that sound and light tower 
i just liked
listening to the music 
and  the night before 
i got to bring my mama down 
we got to listen
to kenny rogers 
she liked that  that was nice 
and i guess i also get
a nice vantage point
to take a look at
all the pretty girls 
i am not a homosexual 
and neither is david dutchess 
so you and david dutchess
are not lovers 
asked and answered 
mr  jewell  you said before
that in your comings
and goings back and forth
from the stage to the tower
that you couldn t get  uh 
an exact fix on the time 
is that correct 
 hesitates 
yes  but when you
have the runs 
which i did  excuse me 
you re not thinking
about what time it is 
you re just trying to
 chuckles 
crab walk to a bathroom 
you know 
so you don t remember
the exact time
that you saw the drunks
throwing the beer cans
against the tower 
right 
no 
you don t remember
the exact time
you first saw the backpack 
that s correct 
you ever seen a backpack
like that before  mr  jewell 
yeah  i suppose so  yeah 
you ever see that specific
backpack before  mr  jewell 
asked and answered 
can we move on 
mr  jewell 
did you conspire with
david dutchess or anybody else
to plant a bomb
in centennial park 
 people screaming 
 women crying 
 panicked shouting 
no 
 tom  then how the fuck
did you know
to be on the other side
of that at t tower
where you knew you d be
protected from the blast 
a bomb went off right
where you were stationed 
chaos erupts 
bodies hit the ground 
cops go flying 
hell  i was one of them 
you come out
without a goddamn scratch 
how does that happen  richard 
 inhales  scoffs softly 
can i ask all you fellas
a question 
jesus  what 
do you have any kind
of case against me 
 tom scoffs 
i mean evidence 
like  any traces of anything
on my mama s tupperware 
or did you find
any bomb making materials
in her apartment 
or did you find some   
okay  hey  hey 
richard  we don t
need to volunteer   
no  i m gonna say this
if i m gonna say anything 
i walk in here
and i look at   
the circle decal
on your windows there 
and i m thinking   
you know  i used to think
that federal law enforcement
was just about
the highest calling
a person could aspire to 
and i m not sure i think
that anymore  you know 
not after all this 
i did my job that night 
and some people are alive
because of that 
but do you think
that the next time
some security guard
sees a suspicious package 
that he or she s
gonna call it in 
i doubt it 
you know   cause
they re gonna look at that
and they re gonna think 
 i don t wanna be
another richard jewell 
so i m just gonna run  
how s that make
anybody any safer 
y all can keep following
me around some more
doing what you re doing 
i can stand it 
but i just know that
every second you spend on me
is time that
you re not spending
on the real guy who did it 
and it s like watson said 
what   
what happens when he   
 sighs 
what happens when
he does it again 
 chuckles 
so  do you have anything
you wanna charge me with 
 tom sighs quietly 
can you 
 sighs 
well 
i think it s time to go 
how d he do 
he did great 
 chuckles  god 
 richard  yeah 
go on 
   watson  hey 
  gentlemen 
 watson  agent shaw 
got something for ya 
 watson  what s this 
marriage proposal 
 watson  oh 
my lucky day 
uh   
okay 
well  this is a good start 
when s the press conference 
i m assuming
you ll be announcing
to all the news outlets 
tom brokaw and the like 
mr  bryant 
let me be perfectly clear 
i still think
your client is guilty as hell 
hmm 
have a nice day 
well  you re entitled
to your opinion 
 richard   this is
to advise you
that based
on the evidence    
 watson  it s over 
is it   
is it really over 
or is this just another
one of their things 
you won  it s over 
 chuckles lightly 
 chuckles softly 
you did good 
 gulps 
oh  i wanna see     sniffs 
i wanna see mama 
you wanna see your mama 
 richard  yeah 
 watson  we can do that 
 chuckles  sniffs 
 taps on paper  that s real 
that s what it says 
    not considered a target
in the federal
criminal investigation
of the bombing of
july 27th  1996 
centennial park  
hey
