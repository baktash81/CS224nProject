sarah dear
are you really hungry
or are you putting food
into your mouth
so you dont have to talk to me
im just a normal
amount of hungry
its possible to eat and have
a conversation at the same time
i think im going to be
sarah
i think im going to be
late for work
you dont have work today
thats why youre here with me
what day is it
do you remember these
my penny collection
why did you stop collecting
i was 10 i took
on other hobbies
where did you find these
why arent you happy anymore
i am happy
why dont you answer my calls
why dont you visit me
dont you love me
goodbye sarah
maam i said is it
an emergency or can you wait
no its not an emergency
fill out as much of this form
as you can initial this
and the yellow page
gives us permission to
maam i thought you said
this wasnt an emergency
how are you feeling
im feeling okay
i havent had any more episodes
thats good news
does this mean
youll be coming home early
you know i cant
do that sweetheart
were at a very critical stage
of the project
no i know i just
thought you might be able to
step away for a moment
perhaps
i need to figure
some things out here first
i understand
hey what did
the gastroenterologist say
shes still running tests
everyone is having
a hard time believing me
that there were no signs
or symptoms leading up to this
who was that
aw nothing it was just
sam texted me
that he got home safely
you went out with
your coworkers tonight
no no no just sam
he accidentally drank
too much though
i sent him home in a taxi
what are you up to tonight
im in the hospital
right right i mean
do you think you can
go to bed soon
yes i probably should
im supposed to get
an endoscopy tomorrow morning
i forgot to tell you about that
they didnt let me eat
or drink anything for dinner
so im quite hungry and thirsty
you can probably hear my stomach
growling louder than my voice
mm mm
thats good
you should get some sleep
oh okay
good night sweetheart
good night peter
were sending you home
so theres nothing
wrong with me
no there most definitely
is something wrong with you
but while we wait
for the current round of tests
to come back
theres nothing more to be done
youd be better off being around
your family and friends
i havent told my mom yet
i wanted to wait until
i had a better idea
of what was happening
i feel much better actually
maybe im getting better
sarah listen very carefully
we may be in the dark here
on what exactly
is happening inside of you
but whatever it is
its very serious
when you go home
you need to rest
you need to take
care of yourself
you need to not drink
do you understand
i understand
very good
thats very very good
hey its peter
leave a message
hey sweetheart
guess what i just did
im not sure tell me
i just went to the gym
the doctor told me to rest
but i woke up feeling energized
and so i decided
to go and work out
and i got very sweaty and hot
so the second i walked
through the door
i took off all my clothes
i actually feel a lot better
than i have in a long time
i dont think im sick anymore
it was probably just a cold
i looked up the symptoms online
and that was one of
the possibilities
whats wrong
you you have a rare
condition and its terminal
youre just imagining the worst
im fine i promise
you accidentally
put my number down
on the primary contact
instead of emergency contacts
so your doctors
been calling me
but i assumed it was
a telemarketer
so i didnt answer
she must have assumed that
youre screening your calls
because she left a very
detailed voicemail in my in box
youre telling me
this on video chat
i know im sorry
how long have you known
two days
i didnt know how to tell you
sarah youre going to die
why arent i crying
i apologize for the voicemail
if we could keep this mixup
from making its way
to the board of directors
i would appreciate it
sure thats fine
so yes you have an incredibly
rare incurable disease
it is inside your stomach
but will eventually spread
throughout your body
it will be painless
but it is killing you
we cannot know how
long you have
but it is only a matter of time
what are my chances
zero
theres a 98 chance
you will succumb
to your illness
i thought you said
there isnt a chance
there isnt
then what about the two percent
thats the margin of error
theres a 2 margin of error
nothing is ever
absolutely certain
though this most certainly is
youre telling me there is a
margin of error of two percent
but youre certain
im definitely going to die
yes
unfortunately
youre taking this quite well
i might add
most people cry
when doctors give them bad news
which is why most
doctors are depressed
i dont want to die
but it sounds like
its not up to me
to use a baseball analogy
life has thrown
you a curve ball
curve balls are tricky throws
for the batter to hit
in this case youre the batter
only youre not even holding
a bat so you most definitely
are going to miss the ball
whats next
what are my options
you should decide on
what type of funeral you want
it usually depends
on ones religious views
but it can also be a reflection
of your personality
for example i know
i want to be buried
not because im religious
but because im afraid
of being forgotten
i want my friends and family
to feel obligated
to come and visit my grave
of course there are the remains
from a cremation
that can be buried or interred
but people are less likely
to visit a pile of ashes
a body in a casket holds
more of an obligation
you can even be buried at sea
though thats usually
reserved for sailors
there are many options
to choose from
ill probably choose
cremation
then there is the decision
of whether or not
you want to go ahead
with replacement
im sure youre already
familiar with the process
when you know
youre going to die
you can have yourself cloned
so that your loved ones wont
have to suffer the loss of you
heres a pamphlet just in case
thank you
remember to discuss it
with your loved ones first
replacement isnt for everyone
for some families it has even
been a negative experience
can i have this
please
hi there my name is tom
im the head west coast
media relations officer
here at the facility
ill be your host
for this introduction
to the world of replacement
of course we all know
that cloning began dur
our scientists have made
countless exciting
breakthroughs and advances
in the facilitys
proprietary technology
its hard to imagine
that at one point
this all seemed like
absurd science fiction
this period is known
as imprintation
your double is more or less
a sponge at this point
they will soak up as much
of what makes you you
as they can before you die
down to the littlest detail
the more time your double
spends learning about you
the more you they will become
in some cases however
your double may only have
a very short time with you
such as in the case
of premeditated suicide
for originals who are very sad
everyday living is a struggle
this double may look
just like his original
but he may as well be
a different person altogether
for some grieving families
this is sufficient
i hope you found this video
fun and informative
you may be dying
but dont let that affect
those who love you most
replacement is a gift to them
isnt that right darling
thats right
im a former double
going on 12 years of being tom
replacement works
hi im currently dying
and i would like
to schedule a consultation
maam im sorry
i forgot to ask you
for some sort of
proof youre dying
they should have
mentioned that on the phone
when you scheduled
your appointment
yes they told me i have a copy
of my hospital charts
i can have my doctor fax
a note too if necessary
no the charts will do
im still not sure
im going to go through with it
id like to talk to someone
first if thats all right
of course you still have
to fill out the form though
of course
theres no way
i can afford this
you must understand that this
is a gift for your loved ones
can you put a price on them
not having to be sad
youre going to die
and we understand and are
sensitive to that inevitability
what we do is we set up
a payment plan
when you pass away
and your double becomes you
they take over
your responsibilities
and one of those
responsibilities
is to keep paying
off the procedure
the most important thing is
that you dont have
to worry about anything
other than dying with dignity
im afraid of needles
and i sometimes have nightmares
of being put under anesthesia
but waking up during
the surgery
all you have to do
is spit into this
how long does it all take
about an hour
can i get you a refill
yes please but only half
i dont need a whole glass
hello
hi you must be sarah
i caught a glimpse
of myself in the mirror
and i look a lot like you
yes im sarah
so sarah is your original
for now youll go by the name
sarahs double
when you replace her
youll take her name
you have very clean skin
and your hair shines
in the light better than mine
i like your shirt
i should tell you
that there was an error
in the coding process
it affected the gene
that determines eye color
were happy to decommission
this double and try again
if youd like
oh no that wont be necessary
blue eyes are less common
and more interesting
than brown eyes
great well give you
a fivepercent discount
on the process to
make it up to you
oh that would be wonderful
before he put me in these
temporary clothes
the technician made a joke to me
about how now hes
seen you naked
are you hungry
not right now
what are some
of your favorite foods
i like mexican food
japanese food
and also indian food
i cant wait to try those then
what is your least
favorite kind of food
thats a good question
maybe french food
it can be quite heavy
is there
a style of music you like best
i like all kinds of music
particularly pop rock
and hiphop
would you like to
listen any of those right now
maybe later
im enjoying this conversation
and music might make it
hard to hear each other
are there any styles of music
you dont like so much
country
and metal
its just a bunch of noise
welcome home
its nice
do you live here alone
no i live here
with my boyfriend peter
hes away on business though
he wont be back
for several more weeks
i hope i get to see him again
before i die
hes very handsome
and hardworking
he sounds like it
im excited to meet him
ill introduce you
to my mom too
what about your dad
he passed away a few years ago
50 percent of marriages
end in divorce but
my parents were still together
when he died
i never saw them fight
i know she misses him
im excited to meet your mom
i havent told
her about you yet
i havent told peter either
but im going to
actually im not sure i want
my mom to know im sick
im afraid shell be sad
im her only child
when youre gone
i promise to love her
as much as you do
maybe more
same for peter
i will love him so much
lets get some clothes for you
you dont have any cellulite
or love handles
i guess i dont have
either of those things
youre right
feels slightly loose on me
i may be a size
smaller than you
you should probably
take me shopping
whats your favorite
sexual position
um its boring
but i like missionary
sometimes its nice
to be choked lightly
whats peters
favorite position
he likes standing
both from behind
and facing each other
and he likes to blindfold me
but i like to be able
to see him though
sure but i imagine
not being able to see
heightens the other senses
you know i dont think
i care for this top
maybe when you take me shopping
ill look for a different style
sweetheart
have you seen my shoes
uh are they these black ones
no those are sarahs
mine are tan and
more fashionable
never mind i found them
they were by the door
where i usually leave them
wow sweetheart
you look beautiful
so do you
which restaurant
are we going to
we are going
to a french brasserie
french food is my favorite
oh hey sarah
sorry i didnt see you there
peter and i are going on a date
i think we all knew there was
something between peter and me
so its nice
to just be open about it
i really value your friendship
ill miss that when you die
speaking of which any updates
i have a doctors
appointment tomorrow
honey we should hurry
or were going to be late
okay
peter and i will probably make
love when we get home tonight
as you know i tend to be loud
so i wanted you to be aware
please come in
have a seat
how are you feeling
i feel okay
its been completely painless
just as you said it would be
the worst part has
been the waiting
i know its coming
but i dont know when
i go to sleep every
night thinking
maybe tomorrow will be
the day i dont wake up
id rather die in my sleep
than die awake
id rather not be able
to feel it happening
sarah i dont know
how to tell you this
other than direct
and to the point
youve gone into
complete remission
youre not dying anymore
you told me it was certain
i did mention
the margin of error
are you sure
my stomach is hurting
a little bit right now
did you have anything to
eat for breakfast this morning
no
youre most likely
just hungry then
i dont understand
to be perfectly honest
we dont either
but it seems
youve recovered completely
and theres no reason
to think you cant live
a long fulfilling life
your family will be thrilled
i never told my mom
why not
i didnt want her to worry
my double was going to take over
like nothing ever happened
with contact lenses of course
she wouldnt have to miss me
you should see the facility
about having your double
decommissioned
by law the only people
who are allowed doubles
are people who are dying
and you are no longer
one of those people
we actually went rollerskating
oh it was fun
i fell didnt i
very badly but it was fun
i used to roller skate
with your father
oh
you introduced her to my mom
sarah whats going on
mom im sarah
you agreed to wait until i died
before you introduced her
to my mom as me
died
i didnt introduce
your double to your mom
shes been in contact with her
on her own for months now
youre pretending to be me
while im still alive
youre talking to her
someone had to
all your mother wanted
was a call here and there
from the daughter she loves
sarah will one of you
please tell me whats happening
i was dying
i had a disease
that was killing me
and so i decided
to get a replacement
so that you wouldnt
have to miss me
why didnt you tell me
i know i did this for you
it was supposed to
be a nice gift
how much longer do you have
thats the thing
its almost funny
i did all of this for nothing
what do you mean
im not going to die after all
i just left my doctors office
and im in remission
youre going to be
decommissioned
and we can go back
to being together
and everything can
go back to normal
what do you mean decommissioned
dont worry mother
no dont you fucking
talk to her
youre done i am going
to fucking abort you
all right come on
im sarah not you
youre nothing youre no one
come on lets go outside
youre not kissing me
here try again
eh what are you doing
what do you mean
im with her now
didnt you hear me
shes going to be
decommissioned
so we can go back
to you and me
its not that simple
what is it about her
its little things
like her inflection
when she says my name
hers goes up peter
yours is flat peter
i can say your name
that way if you want
just tell me what you want me
to be and ill be it for you
you always try too hard
to impress new people
you speak over me or for me
you have to control
social situations
im embarrassed to
go out with you
every time we go out
my coworkers
make fun of you
behind your back
that is when i can actually
get you to leave the house
and even if i do
its always on me
i cant do it anymore
even if i cant be with her
i dont want to be with you
i love you peter
and no one will ever love you
as much as i do
i know
but i dont love you anymore
whats it like to fuck me
while you look into
someone elses eyes
you need therapy sarah
wait this is my moms house
mom hey mom
peter locked me out
i hope the decommission process
is painful for you bitch
and i hope its emotionally
painful for the two of you
hello
is this sarah
yes whos this
i represent your double
this call is to notify you
that she will be
exercising her rights
in accordance
with the 28th amendment
of the constitution
your double has filed
a motion to stay
what do you mean stay
i suggest you
consult with legal counsel
have a nice day
its a fairly standard
motion to stay
all the usual stipulations
no contact with your double
starting immediately
because the lease
is in your exs name
youre being asked to move out
theyre giving you two days
which is quite generous
as usually its only one
the duel to the death will be
in approximately one year
the exact date to be determined
by the court at a later time
and youll be expected to pay
support to your double
in the interim
wait did you say
duel to the death
yes it is to determine
which of you will live
the rest of sarahs life
we cant have two of you
walking around forever
that would be ridiculous
i thought she was going
to be decommissioned
well in cases such as yours
when an original is going
to live after all
the double is usually
decommissioned yes
but in even rarer cases
when a double has been
in the world long enough
to start becoming
their own person
they sometimes would prefer
to continue to live
they can request a stay
and a duel is set
i thought the duels
were only for prisoners
who commit the crime
worse than murder
theyre also used for stays
havent even seen
one on television
theyre quite popular
i dont care for violence
it makes me nauseous
well youll need
to get over that
if you want any chance
of surviving your duel
i suggest taking personal
combat training lessons
from a personal combat trainer
also we should
discuss my rates
you can take the sheets with
the giant blood stain on them
you should have
washed them in cold water
you can take anything you like
your double has
different taste than you
and wed like to
redecorate anyway
maybe leave the couch though
and the nice coffee table
but other than that
you can take anything you like
hey sweetheart
is she still there
yes she is
but shes going to be gone soon
im glad i dont have to see
her disgusting face
again for a while
oh tell her to take
the bloody sheets with her
dont worry i already did
good
i miss you
i miss you too
do you want to live
yes
i dont believe you
i want to live
because if you know
that you do not care
if you live or die in your duel
you may as well
tell me right now
i will tear up your contract
and you can spend all the money
that you save over the next year
on drugs and alcohol
vacations to the beach sex
trips to amusement parks
you will surely
die in your duel
but you will have lived
your last year on earth
in an excessive
and exciting fashion
i said i want to live
are you prepared to kill
yes
i believe you
first we need to get
your body healthy and ready
for whats to come
well start with some
general calisthenics
come on
i feel like im
going to throw up
its due to all
the lactic acid in your blood
its temporarily poisoning you
dont worry the feeling
will go away eventually
im going to live
this is my life
shes not going
to take it from me
i want you to watch
that tonight
its not very good
but there are some images in it
that i want you
to get used to seeing
ill see you tomorrow
oh for crying out loud
barbara i told you dont leave
your ring next to the sink
got ya
barbara im stuck barbara
barbara quit kidding around
barbara this isnt funny
barbara stop
barbara stop im your husband
you were right
the plot was convoluted
and the acting wasnt very good
but i see why you wanted me
to watch it
ill send you home
with the sequel today
its a worse film
but its even more violent
are you ready to get started
it will take place on a field
usually a football field
or a soccer field
or sometimes even a public park
if theres enough space
each opponent will stand
on opposite ends of the field
an official will signal
for the officials on the field
to remove a sheet
covering a table
on the table
there will be five weapons
your opponent will have
an identical cache of weapons
you will have 10 seconds
to choose a weapon
your opponent will be
obstructed from view
during this 10second long
decisionmaking process
if there is a gun on the table
it is most likely that both
combatants will choose it
but guns run out of bullets
and axe does not need bullets
to slice through an arm
an axe is much
heavier and slower
than a dagger which you need
to be in close proximity to use
so you see it is all about
careful yet decisive strategy
yes
what happens
if you drop your weapon
and are too far away from
the table to grab another
i like that youre
already thinking this way
how many weapons
do you see here
five
count again
i still count five
there are six weapons
a properly trained human body
is a weapon
i would like for you to start
working out on your own time
this way we can spend
an entire hour
on weapons training
and handtohand combat
im sometimes unmotivated
to work out on my own
its easier when theres
someone there pushing me
the key is finding
something that you enjoy
there are many activities
that you can do
that are also a great workout
such as bike riding
rock climbing dancing
or even swimming
oh i almost forgot
ill get you that dvd
for number three
i chose slit throat
excellent
hm
remember no emotion
sorry
i chose bluntforce trauma
to the head
i knew this one right away
this is definitely
a gunshot wound to the chest
most likely from
a lowcaliber weapon
it has probably
punctured his lung
gunshot wound good
arrow to the head
multiple stab wounds
excellent
this one was difficult
i saw you
having trouble with it
what did you decide on
i wasnt sure but i picked
electrocution
good guess
but remember there would be
visual indicators
such as singed hair or clothing
and burns to the body
this is a death by poison
of course
i should have known it
its okay
you only missed this one
and poison is hardly
a weapon chosen by the court
because it is slow to act
and not as visually exciting
once i accidentally cut myself
with a pair of scissors
while trimming my bangs
as i washed the wound in
the sink
it began to bleed
and i fainted
im lucky i didnt fall
on the scissors
but now even a mutilated body
barely phases me
photos of a mutilated
human body
photos yes
ive set up a field trip
for you next week
im not entirely
sure when it will be
due to the nature
of the activity
but i will let you know
the day before
by the way i called the bank
about my card being declined
i have to pay an overdraft fee
which is frustrating
but you should have this months
payment tomorrow
thank you for sorting that out
between the personal
combat training
clone support
and hiphop dance classes
money has been
a little tight recently
i understand
sometimes its possible to pay
for services in other ways
maybe we can come up
with some sort of arrangement
that is mutually beneficial
how much is this
208 including tax
uh 1 dollar and 34 cents
on pump 2 please
hello
where is that
can i help you
trent told me to come see you
even though its covered
im sure you can
already tell what this is
a person
a body
this body was once a person
but now it is just a body
youll notice she was
about your age when she died
she has your hair color
your eye color
and even looks
a little like you
was she killed in a duel
no she was not
she was killed
while riding a motorcycle
her friends and family say
she was a safe driver
she was even wearing
a fullface helmet
but another vehicle
ran a red light
and struck her headon
she was alive for a few minutes
witnesses say she even admitted
she should have
purchased a car instead
what was her name
that doesnt matter
first we need to open up
the chest cavity
and inspect the vital organs
im cutting into the skin
pulling it back to allow access
there next
we cut the ribs
surrounding the chest plate
then we cut away the cartilage
revealing the heart and
bang bang bang
ah the gun jammed
the first two shots missed but
the last one got me in my side
it missed my vital
organs though
boom
nice thinking
destroying my weapons cache
would have definitely
sealed my fate
ah
stab
ah im less mobile now
stab stab
the first stab
punctures my liver
i will die from this wound
but not immediately
it will be slow and painful
im taking you out
with me though
slice
im cut
im bleeding severely
and oh no
the knife got knocked
out of my hand
ah ah
i block the sword
and tie up your hands
with the garrotte
not only did that
force me to lose my grip
but its also slicing into
the radial artery of my wrist
ah
not only is this cutting off
the blood supply to my brain
but the wire is
slicing into my flesh
im dead
good
you should have used the gun
always use the gun
if its an option
i know i just
i find guns to be
boring and overused
i know what you mean
but if its the difference
between life and death
its okay to be boring
only a week to go
but i would say
that youre feeling very strong
both physically and mentally
im going to kill her
i just know it
can i help you find anything
no
im just browsing
well let me know
if i can help in any way
wait
im looking for
an outfit to die in
youre in luck
we just got some pieces in
for the new season
that are to die for
no not to die for to die in
im looking for an outfit
that if hypothetically
i were to die in
i would be okay with
something that reflects my
personality and is functional
but mainly i need it
to be flattering to my figure
ive gotten in shape
over the past year
but i still carry insecurities
about my body
if im going to die well
at least i want to do it
looking my best
i dont care how much it costs
fuck
shit
what do you mean postponed
due to weather
i dont mind getting wet
well the issue isnt rain
theres a chance
for thunderstorms
then when
in a month
a month
another thing
this delay is considered
an act of god
so youll need to continue
paying support to your double
the double
of course
for another month
i spent everything
i had yesterday
on what
an outfit for the duel
if you default on your payments
the court will
assign you a handicap
such as having to duel with one
arm tied behind your back
ill figure something out
the double has won the duel
goodbye sarah
hes robert michaels now
how have you been
good
i started a new job recently
hey
do you like it
i think i do
i dont know yet
how are you
im okay
they postponed the duel
as im sure youre aware
i am
she doesnt talk about
the duel all that much
i was surprised
you wanted to meet up
it felt like it was time
i want to apologize
for how things ended
i know i said some
really hurtful things there
i understand
i took it as you trying
to push me away
i wanted to see you
and tell you i dont hate you
i wouldnt want to die
with you thinking i hated you
i appreciate you saying that
im going to try my best
to kill her though
and i wont be sorry for it
i need you to know that
i know
should we order
something to eat
i think that would be nice
hi trent
the duel has been postponed
can i keep training with you
for another month
uh well i was wondering
you know how you were
talking about other forms
of payment
that were mutually beneficial
does that offer still stand
and let me see you get low
if you want this thug
now take it to the floor
and if your ass wanna act
then you can keep your ass
where youre at
3 6 9 stand real fine
hoping she can sock it to me
one more time
get low get low
get low get low
to the window
to the wall
til the sweat drop
down my balls
dont get frustrated
lets do it slower
five six seven eight
yes better
okay lets do
it from the start
thank you
now bring your
ass over here ho
and let me see you get low
if you want this thug
now take it to the floor
and if your ass wanna act
then you can keep your ass
where youre at
3 6 9 stand real fine
hoping she can sock it to me
one more time
get low get low
get low get low
to the window
thank you again for
the hiphop dance lessons
ive wanted to take classes
for three years now
but ive been too
nervous to start
i hope you continue dancing
even if i die in my duel
ive already signed up
for a beginner group class
oh thats good
i know this isnt ideal
for you to wait
another month to duel
your double to the death
but look at it as
an opportunity
try to see the positives
another month means
another month of training
do you see this dog here
the one here on the leash
hm his name is connor
i named him after
my grandfather
hes your dog
he is
aw he looks friendly
do you see that crossbow there
that one
yes
grab it
stand over there
shoot my dog
why
connor is very old
and very sick
i dont want to
its okay hes suffering
hes in an immense
amount of pain
youll be putting him
out of his misery
do it sarah
please
hes in agony
i cant
i understand
im disappointed
in your killer instincts
but
at least my dog is still alive
what the fuck sarah
im sorry
hi
hi
did you lose her
did you lose your twin
yes i cant find
my twin sister
she looks exactly like me
because were twins
just like you two
have you seen her
shes over here
you dont have
to be scared anymore
we found your sister
when i and abby
were really small
and we went to the store
with mommy
and a man came up
and wanted to show abby a toy
i wanted to see the toy too
but the man said
that if both of us
would be looking at the toy
mommy could get scared
that where are we
when mommy came back
i told her about the man
but abby was gone
abby didnt come for three days
and they found her in
a parking lot
i missed her terribly much
and i cried a lot
but now
we are all the time together
except when she goes to talk
to miss murphy every sunday
but your sister is here
and she loves you very much
girls
who are you let go of her
sorry
mommy
she asked us to help
to find her twin sister
i think you should leave
come on
i know youre in there
youre going
to try and murder me
look i realize i shot at you
ive been training for a year
to kill you it was instinctual
you surprised me
what else would you expect
were supposed
to wait until the duel
i know open the door
i promise i wont
try to murder you
okay
you almost got me
even through the glass
im surprised i missed
even through the glass
im agile
can i ask you something
sure
when we first met
all those months ago
when i shook your hand
why didnt you
look me in the eye
im not sure
i think it was because
i knew what was going to happen
i mean i knew i was going
to take over eventually
and i think i felt
a sense of guilt
taking over my life
was the plan not stealing it
i understand you feel that i
stole it but its my life too
but it was my life first
yes but that doesnt mean
my life matters any less
but your life is my life
it was your life
but ive moved past your life
and made it my own
yes but you knowingly stole
everything that made up my life
to make up yours
i understand that you feel like
i went about it the wrong way
and to be honest its not what
i thought it would be anyway
what do you mean
well peter and i argue about
the littlest things sometimes
for example last week
i wanted to watch
a romantic comedy and he wanted
to watch a dark comedy
how can i be with someone
if we cant even agree
on the genre of film
we should watch
or take our mother
she acts like i owe her my life
phone calls just to talk
texts asking me how are you
one before 900 am saying
i love you very much
and dont even get me started
on the amount of forwarded
social media posts
that are only moderately funny
they already have a day for
mothers isnt that enough
what are you trying to say
im still not sure
its your life now
ive moved on
and im making a new one
im still going
to kill you in the duel
but ill make it quicker
and less painful
than i had originally planned
i want to take you somewhere
where
were a little late
i pushed him and he fell over
he held up his hands
as a shield
i will never forget
the screams he made
sorry
thats all right
please come take a seat
carl had just started to tell us
about how hes been feeling
since his duel
i cant remember
exactly where i was
my memory isnt
what it used to be
in the moment shooting
my double in the face
didnt make me feel bad
i knew it was him or me
seeing his brain on that grass
meant that i was going
to get to spend more time
with my children
and grandchildren
its been three years
but i still wake up
from nightmares
i cry in my sleep
thats why my wife
sleeps on the couch
she cant stand
to see me this way
sometimes i wonder
what was the point
of fighting to live
if this is the life im living
nice try
your mental tricks
arent going to work on me
nothing you do or say
or he does or says
or they do or say
is going to keep me
from surviving this whole mess
its not like that
believe me when i say that
im going to do my very best
to kill you too
just like ive also
definitely been training to do
i just wanted you
to see people like us
and hear their experiences
whichever one of us lives
is going to have to
live with this
for the rest of our life
your doubles name
is sarahs double
so i can only assume
your name is sarah
im daryl the group leader
im responsible for starting
the checkin process
and i ensure individuals
stay on topic
i also introduce the arts and
crafts activity of the meeting
perhaps we should
move along to that
everyone raise
their nondominant hand
i want you to use this hand
to compose a letter
to your original
or to your double
depending on which one you are
this is to help you connect
to a part of you that
could also feel like it belongs
to another person
at the same time
you see where
im going with this
i had only two days
of imprintation with you
you let me discover
your lifeless body
in a bath of red
lukewarm water
i didnt know how to be you
i still dont
i dont like the people
you forced me to live with
it makes me depressed
i want to kill myself too
but we all know there cannot be
doubles of doubles
and even though
i didnt choose to be made
i dont want to let anyone down
like you did
best
larry
most people would look down
upon what we had
but it was better than anything
they will ever know
we knew each other
intrinsically
better than if you knew
someone else an entire lifetime
i still miss your touch
im sorry you had to die
i would like to go next
sarah
what you said in there
im still at a loss
i mean the way you eloquently
accepted all the blame
the way you effectively argued
that the real enemy
isnt each other
its a system that arbitrarily
decides only one of us can live
and that has us
fight to the death
as some sort of sick
spectator sport
im sure you wrote something
similar in your letter
maybe youll read it
for me someday
yeah
and youre right
we actually have
a lot in common
a lot like being
good at swimming
and we both have great breasts
exactly
why should one of
us have to die
why cant we be together
im not saying we should fuck
like that one guy in there
obviously did with his double
but why cant we both live
do you mean that
im glad you know how to drive
i never learned
it seems easy enough though
you just press forward
on the right one
and you stop by pulling it back
no you press the pedal
to the left of it to brake
huh that makes sense
and you change directions
with that round thing
turning it to the right
makes the car go right
and turning it to the left
makes it go left
see easy enough
comfortable clothing
check
backpacks
yours is smaller than
i was expecting
i have everything i need
check
no weapons
none
i didnt bring any either
if its all right with you
id like to make sure
you didnt bring any
i dont want to do it here
on the side of the road
maybe when we take
our first break
thats fine with me
id like to check your pack
too for peace of mind
of course
rations check
and water
yes last on the list is water
i have it check
lets drink some
before we begin walking
i dont think i have
to remind you
of the importance of
staying hydrated
lets take another
bigger drink just to be safe
thank you
i wonder what will happen
when we both dont show up
for the duel
one of the combatants in a duel
has failed to show up
before out of fear
but theyre almost always
later found and arrested
some try to get plastic surgery
in order to look different
but i found out from trent
that once were a part
of the replacement program
any attempts to contact
a plastic surgeon are flagged
theres always the blackmarket
though but you are taking
a big risk getting
a blackmarket face transplant
as far as i know
there has never been a duel
where both the original
and the double are noshows
theyll send dogs after us
but well be across
the border by then
once we cross the border
well be safe
im incredibly thankful
you came and found me
and to think just a few
weeks ago i wanted you dead
im so glad were both
in such good shape
we would have needed
many more rests already
had we not been training
this past year
yes
i agree
sorry im late
which one are you
the original sarah
where have you been
i had a little car trouble
what kind of car trouble
i accidentally mistook the wheel
that turns the car right or left
for the pedal
that stops the car
im fine should we begin
we cant start yet
why not
because your double isnt here
really
actually that sounds
just like her
she didnt take this duel
very seriously
i bet she hasnt even
been training for it
you should probably
let your superiors know
shes likely trying to flee
yes
im afraid not maam
just the original
i have reason to believe
this is a code negative one
and do you sir swear that
to the best of your knowledge
having known her
emotionally and intimately
that this is the original sarah
i do
and do you swear
beyond the shadow of any
reasonable doubt
that the person before us today
is the daughter that gestated
inside you for nine months
and you raised for 18 years
your own flesh and blood
this is my sarah your honor
and finally
do you solemnly swear
that you are
who you say you are
im sarah
i think i have a new wrinkle
and two new sunspots
im sure you dont
i can count peter
theres exactly one new wrinkle
on my face and two new sunspots
well you have to start
using sunscreen
and not just when
youre going to the beach
or when youre
walking around a theme park
it has to be daily
your skin is more
sensitive than others
and you have to start
taking better care of yourself
i dont mean to sound
insensitive but
its only going to get
a lot harder from here
as long as men take
moderate care of themselves
they tend to peak later in life
women on the other hand
have a much smaller window
in which theyre deemed to be
at their peak attractiveness
and dont worry sweetheart
im gonna love you
no matter how you look
even with that genetic mutation
that causes premature
graying and hair loss
should i buy more hair dye
for you while im out
no ill get some
on my way home from work
remember to keep making
at least the minimum payment
on the replacement loan
i know peter
where should we go
for dinner tonight
how about mexican food
i dont like mexican food
arent you going to answer that
shes my mom not yours
hi sarah
this is your mother
just calling to talk
i must have just missed you
youre probably just walking
out the door of your house
getting into your car
ready to start another
day at your job
which you love
i just wanted you to know
i went ahead and ordered
another box of contacts
from the optometrist
the colored ones
arent always in stock
so its best to
order ahead of time
i know youre still getting
settled back into your life
so i figured something
as simple as new contacts
might slip through the cracks
