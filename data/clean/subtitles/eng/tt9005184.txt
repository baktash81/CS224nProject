unh 
ahh 
fuck 
ah  fuck 
ah  ahh 
well done  you   
well done  you re the winner 
remind me  are you the original
or the double 
the double 
of course 
i always get mixed up 
obviously it gets confusing
when you both look identical 
excellent work negating
his ranged attack
and closing the distance 
thank you 
the double has won the duel 
he s robert michaels now 
can i take your order 
yes  i ll have
one two layer taco 
two soft tacos 
a double burrito 
and an order of nachos 
which one 
we have several kinds of nachos 
the one that s just
the chips and cheese dip 
how many drinks for this order 
only one 
i don t know  it s haunted 
but look  there s a pool 
yeah  yeah 
oh  yeah 
well  hello 
hey  sweetheart 
what are you up to 
just watching television 
what are you watching 
a reality competition
show about dating 
that doesn t sound very good 
it isn t very good  but
i consider it a guilty pleasure 
what are you doing 
i took my team out
for drinks after work tonight 
they ve been doing such
a great job on this project 
what about
that co worker of yours
you were telling me about  sam 
is he still struggling
with the workload 
actually  sam s doing
tremendous now 
oh  oh  that s good  i guess 
in fact  i m even
considering giving him
a most improved award 
awards in the workplace
have been proven   
increase morale even if it if   
it d d d   
really mean anything 
i miss you 
i miss you  too  sweetheart 
maybe i ll call you
one more time before bed 
no  that s okay 
i actually think i m going
to go to bed soon  too 
really  it s so early there 
yes  but i m tired 
all right  well  you should
definitely get some rest 
and we can talk tomorrow 
i ll text you when i wake up 
all right  good night  sarah 
yes  yes  yes  yes  yes 
sarah  dear 
are you really hungry 
or are you putting food
into your mouth
so you don t have to talk to me 
i m just a normal
amount of hungry 
it s possible to eat and have
a conversation at the same time 
  i think i m going to be   
  sarah   
i think i m going to be
late for work 
you don t have work today 
that s why you re here with me 
what day is it 
do you remember these 
my penny collection 
why did you stop collecting 
i was 10  i took
on other hobbies 
where did you find these 
why aren t you happy anymore 
i am happy 
why don t you answer my calls 
why don t you visit me 
don t you love me 
goodbye  sarah 
ma am  i said  is it
an emergency  or can you wait 
no  it s not an emergency 
fill out as much of this form
as you can  initial this 
and the yellow page
gives us permission to   
ma am  i thought you said
this wasn t an emergency 
how are you feeling 
i m feeling okay 
i haven t had any more episodes 
that s good news 
does this mean
you ll be coming home early 
you know i can t
do that  sweetheart 
we re at a very critical stage
of the project 
no  i know  i just
thought you might be able to   
step away for a moment 
perhaps 
i need to figure
some things out here first 
i understand 
hey  what did
the gastroenterologist say 
she s still running tests 
everyone is having
a hard time believing me
that there were no signs
or symptoms leading up to this 
who was that 
aw  nothing  it was just   
sam texted me
that he got home safely 
you went out with
your co workers tonight 
no  no  no  just sam 
he accidentally drank
too much  though 
i sent him home in a taxi 
what are you up to tonight 
i m in the hospital 
right  right    i mean   
do you think you can
go to bed soon 
yes  i probably should 
i m supposed to get
an endoscopy tomorrow morning 
i forgot to tell you about that 
they didn t let me eat
or drink anything for dinner 
so i m quite hungry and thirsty 
you can probably hear my stomach
growling louder than my voice 
mm  mm 
that s good 
you should get some sleep 
oh  okay 
good night  sweetheart 
good night  peter 
we re sending you home 
so there s nothing
wrong with me 
no  there most definitely
is something wrong with you 
but while we wait
for the current round of tests
to come back 
there s nothing more to be done 
you d be better off being around
your family and friends 
i haven t told my mom yet 
i wanted to wait until
i had a better idea
of what was happening 
i feel much better  actually 
maybe i m getting better 
sarah  listen very carefully 
we may be in the dark here
on what exactly
is happening inside of you 
but whatever it is 
it s very serious 
when you go home 
you need to rest 
you need to take
care of yourself 
you need to not drink 
do you understand 
i understand 
very good 
that s very  very good 
hey  it s peter 
leave a message 
hey  sweetheart 
guess what i just did 
i m not sure  tell me 
i just went to the gym 
the doctor told me to rest 
but i woke up feeling energized 
and so i decided
to go and work out 
and i got very sweaty and hot 
so the second i walked
through the door 
i took off all my clothes 
i actually feel a lot better
than i have in a long time 
i don t think i m sick anymore 
it was probably just a cold 
i looked up the symptoms online 
and that was one of
the possibilities 
what s wrong 
you    you have a rare
condition  and it s terminal 
you re just imagining the worst 
i m fine  i promise 
you accidentally
put my number down
on the primary contact
instead of emergency contacts 
so your doctor s
been calling me 
but i assumed it was
a telemarketer 
so i didn t answer 
she must have assumed that
you re screening your calls
because she left a very
detailed voicemail in my in box 
you re telling me
this on video chat 
i know  i m sorry 
how long have you known 
two days 
i didn t know how to tell you 
sarah  you re going to die 
why aren t i crying 
i apologize for the voicemail 
if we could keep this mix up
from making its way
to the board of directors 
i would appreciate it 
sure  that s fine 
so  yes  you have an incredibly
rare incurable disease 
it is inside your stomach 
but will eventually spread
throughout your body 
it will be painless 
but it is killing you 
we cannot know how
long you have 
but it is only a matter of time 
what are my chances 
zero 
there s a 98  chance
you will succumb
to your illness 
i thought you said
there isn t a chance 
there isn t 
then what about the two percent 
that s the margin of error 
there s a 2  margin of error 
nothing is ever
absolutely certain 
though this most certainly is 
you re telling me there is a
margin of error of two percent 
but you re certain
i m definitely going to die 
yes 
unfortunately 
you re taking this quite well 
i might add 
most people cry
when doctors give them bad news 
which is why most
doctors are depressed 
i don t want to die 
but it sounds like
it s not up to me 
to use a baseball analogy 
life has thrown
you a curve ball 
curve balls are tricky throws
for the batter to hit 
in this case  you re the batter 
only  you re not even holding
a bat  so you most definitely
are going to miss the ball 
what s next 
what are my options 
you should decide on
what type of funeral you want 
it usually depends
on one s religious views 
but it can also be a reflection
of your personality 
for example  i know
i want to be buried 
not because i m religious 
but because i m afraid
of being forgotten 
i want my friends and family
to feel obligated
to come and visit my grave 
of course  there are the remains
from a cremation
that can be buried or interred 
but people are less likely
to visit a pile of ashes 
a body in a casket holds
more of an obligation 
you can even be buried at sea 
though that s usually
reserved for sailors 
there are many options
to choose from 
i ll probably choose   
cremation 
then there is the decision
of whether or not
you want to go ahead
with replacement 
i m sure you re already
familiar with the process 
when you know
you re going to die 
you can have yourself cloned
so that your loved ones won t
have to suffer the loss of you 
here s a pamphlet  just in case 
thank you 
remember to discuss it
with your loved ones first 
replacement isn t for everyone 
for some families  it has even
been a negative experience 
  can i have this 
  please 
hi  there  my name is tom 
i m the head west coast
media relations officer
here at the facility 
i ll be your host
for this introduction
to the world of replacement 
of course  we all know
that cloning began dur   
our scientists have made
countless exciting
breakthroughs and advances
in the facility s
proprietary technology 
it s hard to imagine
that  at one point 
this all seemed like
absurd science fiction 
this period is known
as  imprintation  
your double is more or less
a sponge at this point 
they will soak up as much
of what makes you  you 
as they can before you die 
down to the littlest detail 
the more time your double
spends learning about you 
the more  you  they will become 
in some cases  however 
your double may only have
a very short time with you 
such as in the case
of premeditated suicide 
for originals who are very sad 
everyday living is a struggle 
this double may look
just like his original 
but he may as well be
a different person altogether 
for some grieving families 
this is sufficient 
i hope you found this video
fun and informative 
you may be dying 
but don t let that affect
those who love you most 
replacement is a gift to them 
isn t that right  darling 
that s right 
i m a former double 
going on 12 years of being tom 
replacement works 
hi  i m currently dying
and i would like
to schedule a consultation 
ma am  i m sorry 
i forgot to ask you
for some sort of
proof you re dying 
they should have
mentioned that on the phone
when you scheduled
your appointment 
yes  they told me  i have a copy
of my hospital charts 
i can have my doctor fax
a note too if necessary 
no  the charts will do 
i m still not sure
i m going to go through with it 
i d like to talk to someone
first  if that s all right 
of course  you still have
to fill out the form  though 
of course 
there s no way
i can afford this 
you must understand that this
is a gift for your loved ones 
can you put a price on them
not having to be sad 
you re going to die 
and we understand and are
sensitive to that inevitability 
what we do is we set up
a payment plan 
when you pass away
and your double becomes you 
they take over
your responsibilities 
and one of those
responsibilities
is to keep paying
off the procedure 
the most important thing is
that you don t have
to worry about anything 
other than dying with dignity 
i m afraid of needles 
and i sometimes have nightmares
of being put under anesthesia
but waking up during
the surgery 
all you have to do
is spit into this 
how long does it all take 
about an hour 
can i get you a refill 
yes  please  but only half 
i don t need a whole glass 
hello 
hi  you must be sarah 
i caught a glimpse
of myself in the mirror 
and i look a lot like you 
yes  i m sarah 
so  sarah is your original 
for now  you ll go by the name
sarah s double 
when you replace her 
you ll take her name 
you have very clean skin 
and your hair shines
in the light better than mine 
i like your shirt 
i should tell you
that there was an error
in the coding process 
it affected the gene
that determines eye color 
we re happy to decommission
this double and try again
if you d like 
oh  no  that won t be necessary 
blue eyes are less common
and more interesting
than brown eyes 
great  we ll give you
a five percent discount
on the process to
make it up to you 
oh  that would be wonderful 
before he put me in these
temporary clothes 
the technician made a joke to me
about how now he s
seen you naked 
are you hungry 
not right now 
what are some
of your favorite foods 
i like mexican food 
japanese food
and also indian food 
i can t wait to try those  then 
what is your least
favorite kind of food 
that s a good question 
maybe french food 
it can be quite heavy 
is there
a style of music you like best 
i like all kinds of music 
particularly pop  rock 
and hip hop 
would you like to
listen any of those right now 
maybe later 
i m enjoying this conversation 
and music might make it
hard to hear each other 
are there any styles of music
you don t like so much 
country 
and metal 
it s just a bunch of noise 
welcome home 
it s nice 
do you live here alone 
no  i live here
with my boyfriend  peter 
he s away on business  though 
he won t be back
for several more weeks 
i hope i get to see him again
before i die 
he s very handsome
and hard working 
he sounds like it 
i m excited to meet him 
i ll introduce you
to my mom  too 
what about your dad 
he passed away a few years ago 
50 percent of marriages
end in divorce  but   
my parents were still together
when he died 
i never saw them fight 
i know she misses him 
i m excited to meet your mom 
i haven t told
her about you yet 
i haven t told peter either 
but i m going to 
actually  i m not sure i want
my mom to know i m sick 
i m afraid she ll be sad 
i m her only child 
when you re gone 
i promise to love her
as much as you do 
maybe more 
same for peter 
i will love him so much 
let s get some clothes for you 
you don t have any cellulite
or love handles 
i guess i don t have
either of those things 
you re right 
feels slightly loose on me 
i may be a size
smaller than you 
you should probably
take me shopping 
what s your favorite
sexual position 
um  it s boring 
but i like missionary 
sometimes  it s nice
to be choked  lightly 
what s peter s
favorite position 
he likes standing
both from behind
and facing each other 
and he likes to blindfold me 
but i like to be able
to see him  though 
sure  but i imagine
not being able to see
heightens the other senses 
you know  i don t think
i care for this top 
maybe when you take me shopping 
i ll look for a different style 
sweetheart 
have you seen my shoes 
uh  are they these black ones 
no  those are sarah s 
mine are tan and
more fashionable 
never mind  i found them 
they were by the door
where i usually leave them 
wow  sweetheart 
you look beautiful 
so do you 
which restaurant
are we going to 
we are going
to a french brasserie 
french food is my favorite 
oh  hey  sarah 
sorry  i didn t see you there 
peter and i are going on a date 
i think we all knew there was
something between peter and me 
so  it s nice
to just be open about it 
i really value your friendship 
i ll miss that when you die 
speaking of which  any updates 
i have a doctor s
appointment tomorrow 
honey  we should hurry 
or we re going to be late 
okay 
peter and i will probably make
love when we get home tonight 
as you know  i tend to be loud 
so i wanted you to be aware 
please  come in 
have a seat 
how are you feeling 
i feel okay 
it s been completely painless 
just as you said it would be 
the worst part has
been the waiting 
i know it s coming 
but i don t know when 
i go to sleep every
night thinking 
 maybe tomorrow will be
the day i don t wake up  
i d rather die in my sleep
than die awake 
i d rather not be able
to feel it happening 
sarah  i don t know
how to tell you this 
other than direct
and to the point 
you ve gone into
complete remission 
you re not dying anymore 
you told me it was certain 
i did mention
the margin of error 
are you sure 
my stomach is hurting
a little bit right now 
did you have anything to
eat for breakfast this morning 
no 
you re most likely
just hungry  then 
i don t understand 
to be perfectly honest 
we don t either 
but it seems
you ve recovered completely
and there s no reason
to think you can t live
a long  fulfilling life 
your family will be thrilled 
i never told my mom 
why not 
i didn t want her to worry 
my double was going to take over
like nothing ever happened 
with contact lenses  of course 
she wouldn t have to miss me 
you should see the facility
about having your double
decommissioned 
by law  the only people
who are allowed doubles
are people who are dying 
and you are no longer
one of those people 
we actually went roller skating 
oh  it was fun 
i fell  didn t i 
very badly  but it was fun 
i used to roller skate 
with your father 
oh 
you introduced her to my mom 
sarah  what s going on 
mom  i m sarah 
you agreed to wait until i died
before you introduced her
to my mom as me 
died 
i didn t introduce
your double to your mom 
she s been in contact with her
on her own for months now 
you re pretending to be me 
while i m still alive 
you re talking to her 
someone had to 
all your mother wanted
was a call here and there
from the daughter she loves 
sarah  will one of you
please tell me what s happening 
i was dying 
i had a disease
that was killing me 
and so  i decided
to get a replacement
so that you wouldn t
have to miss me 
why didn t you tell me 
i know  i did this for you 
it was supposed to
be a nice gift 
how much longer do you have 
that s the thing 
it s almost funny 
i did all of this for nothing 
what do you mean 
i m not going to die after all 
i just left my doctor s office 
and i m in remission 
you re going to be
decommissioned 
and we can go back
to being together
and everything can
go back to normal 
what do you mean decommissioned 
don t worry  mother 
no  don t you fucking
talk to her 
you re done  i am going
to fucking abort you 
  all right  come on 
  i m sarah  not you 
you re nothing  you re no one 
come on  let s go outside 
you re not kissing me 
here  try again 
  eh    what are you doing 
  what do you mean 
i m with her now 
didn t you hear me 
she s going to be
decommissioned 
so    we can go back
to you and me 
it s not that simple 
what is it about her 
it s little things 
like her inflection
when she says my name 
hers goes up  peter 
yours is flat  peter 
i can say your name
that way if you want 
just tell me what you want me
to be  and i ll be it for you 
you always try too hard
to impress new people 
you speak over me or for me 
you have to control
social situations 
i m embarrassed to
go out with you 
every time we go out 
my co workers
make fun of you
behind your back 
that is  when i can actually
get you to leave the house 
and even if i do 
it s always on me 
i can t do it anymore 
even if i can t be with her 
i don t want to be with you 
i love you  peter 
and no one will ever love you
as much as i do 
i know 
but i don t love you anymore 
what s it like to fuck me
while you look into
someone else s eyes 
you need therapy  sarah 
wait  this is my mom s house 
mom  hey  mom 
peter locked me out 
i hope the decommission process
is painful for you  bitch 
and i hope it s emotionally
painful for the two of you 
hello 
is this sarah 
yes  who s this 
i represent your double 
this call is to notify you
that she will be
exercising her rights
in accordance
with the 28th amendment
of the constitution 
your double has filed
a motion to stay 
what do you mean  stay  
i suggest you
consult with legal counsel 
have a nice day 
it s a fairly standard
motion to stay 
all the usual stipulations 
no contact with your double
starting immediately 
because the lease
is in your ex s name 
you re being asked to move out 
they re giving you two days 
which is quite generous 
as usually it s only one 
the duel to the death will be
in approximately one year 
the exact date to be determined
by the court at a later time 
and you ll be expected to pay
support to your double
in the interim 
wait  did you say
duel to the death 
yes  it is to determine
which of you will live
the rest of sarah s life 
we can t have two of you
walking around forever 
that would be ridiculous 
i thought she was going
to be decommissioned 
well  in cases such as yours 
when an original is going
to live after all 
the double is usually
decommissioned  yes 
but  in even rarer cases 
when a double has been
in the world long enough
to start becoming
their own person 
they sometimes would prefer
to continue to live 
they can request a stay
and a duel is set 
i thought the duels
were only for prisoners
who commit the crime
worse than murder 
they re also used for stays 
haven t even seen
one on television 
they re quite popular 
i don t care for violence 
it makes me nauseous 
well  you ll need
to get over that
if you want any chance
of surviving your duel 
i suggest taking personal
combat training lessons
from a personal combat trainer 
also  we should
discuss my rates 
you can take the sheets with
the giant blood stain on them 
you should have
washed them in cold water 
you can take anything you like 
your double has
different taste than you 
and we d like to
redecorate anyway 
maybe leave the couch  though 
and the nice coffee table 
but other than that 
you can take anything you like 
hey  sweetheart 
is she still there 
yes  she is 
but she s going to be gone soon 
i m glad i don t have to see
her disgusting face
again for a while 
oh  tell her to take
the bloody sheets with her 
don t worry  i already did 
good 
i miss you 
i miss you  too 
do you want to live 
yes 
i don t believe you 
i want to live 
because if you know
that you do not care
if you live or die in your duel 
you may as well
tell me right now 
i will tear up your contract 
and you can spend all the money
that you save over the next year
on drugs and alcohol 
vacations to the beach  sex   
trips to amusement parks 
you will surely
die in your duel 
but you will have lived
your last year on earth
in an excessive
and exciting fashion 
i said i want to live 
are you prepared to kill 
yes 
i believe you 
first  we need to get
your body healthy and ready   
for what s to come 
we ll start with some
general calisthenics 
come on 
i feel like i m
going to throw up 
it s due to all
the lactic acid in your blood 
it s temporarily poisoning you 
don t worry  the feeling
will go away eventually 
i m going to live 
this is my life 
she s not going
to take it from me 
i want you to watch
that tonight 
it s not very good 
but there are some images in it
that i want you
to get used to seeing 
i ll see you tomorrow 
oh  for crying out loud 
barbara  i told you don t leave
your ring next to the sink 
got ya 
barbara  i m stuck  barbara 
barbara  quit kidding around 
barbara  this isn t funny 
barbara  stop 
barbara  stop  i m your husband 
you were right 
the plot was convoluted
and the acting wasn t very good 
but i see why you wanted me
to watch it 
i ll send you home
with the sequel today 
it s a worse film 
but it s even more violent 
are you ready to get started 
it will take place on a field 
usually a football field
or a soccer field 
or sometimes even a public park 
if there s enough space 
each opponent will stand
on opposite ends of the field 
an official will signal
for the officials on the field
to remove a sheet
covering a table 
on the table 
there will be five weapons 
your opponent will have
an identical cache of weapons 
you will have 10 seconds
to choose a weapon 
your opponent will be
obstructed from view
during this 10 second long
decision making process 
if there is a gun on the table 
it is most likely that both
combatants will choose it 
but guns run out of bullets 
and axe does not need bullets
to slice through an arm 
an axe is much
heavier and slower
than a dagger  which you need
to be in close proximity to use 
so  you see  it is all about
careful yet decisive strategy 
yes 
what happens
if you drop your weapon
and are too far away from
the table to grab another 
i like that you re
already thinking this way 
how many weapons
do you see here 
five 
count again 
i still count five 
there are six weapons 
a properly trained human body
is a weapon 
i would like for you to start
working out on your own time 
this way  we can spend
an entire hour
on weapons training
and hand to hand combat 
i m sometimes unmotivated
to work out on my own 
it s easier when there s
someone there pushing me 
the key is finding
something that you enjoy 
there are many activities
that you can do
that are also a great workout
such as bike riding 
rock climbing  dancing 
or even swimming 
oh  i almost forgot 
i ll get you that dvd 
for number three 
i chose slit throat 
excellent 
hm 
remember  no emotion 
sorry 
i chose blunt force trauma
to the head 
i knew this one right away 
this is definitely
a gunshot wound to the chest 
most likely from
a low caliber weapon 
it has probably
punctured his lung 
gunshot wound  good 
arrow to the head 
  multiple stab wounds 
  excellent 
this one was difficult 
i saw you
having trouble with it 
what did you decide on 
i wasn t sure  but i picked   
electrocution 
good guess 
but remember  there would be
visual indicators
such as singed hair or clothing
and burns to the body 
this is a death by poison 
of course 
i should have known it 
it s okay 
you only missed this one 
and poison is hardly
a weapon chosen by the court 
because it is slow to act
and not as visually exciting 
once  i accidentally cut myself
with a pair of scissors
while trimming my bangs 
as i washed the wound in
the sink 
it began to bleed 
and i fainted 
i m lucky i didn t fall
on the scissors 
but now  even a mutilated body
barely phases me 
photos of a mutilated
human body 
photos  yes 
i ve set up a field trip
for you next week 
i m not entirely
sure when it will be
due to the nature
of the activity 
but i will let you know
the day before 
by the way  i called the bank
about my card being declined 
i have to pay an overdraft fee 
which is frustrating 
but you should have this month s
payment tomorrow 
thank you for sorting that out 
between the personal
combat training 
clone support 
and hip hop dance classes 
money has been
a little tight recently 
i understand 
sometimes it s possible to pay
for services in other ways 
maybe we can come up
with some sort of arrangement
that is mutually beneficial 
how much is this 
 2 08 including tax 
uh  1 dollar and 34 cents
on pump 2  please 
hello 
where is that 
can i help you 
trent told me to come see you 
even though it s covered 
i m sure you can
already tell what this is 
a person 
a body 
this body was once a person 
but now it is just a body 
you ll notice she was
about your age when she died 
she has your hair color 
your eye color 
and even looks
a little like you 
was she killed in a duel 
no  she was not 
she was killed
while riding a motorcycle 
her friends and family say
she was a safe driver 
she was even wearing
a full face helmet 
but another vehicle
ran a red light 
and struck her head on 
she was alive for a few minutes 
witnesses say she even admitted
she should have
purchased a car instead 
what was her name 
that doesn t matter 
first  we need to open up
the chest cavity
and inspect the vital organs 
i m cutting into the skin   
pulling it back to allow access 
there  next   
we cut the ribs
surrounding the chest plate 
then we cut away the cartilage
revealing the heart and   
bang  bang  bang 
ah  the gun jammed 
the first two shots missed  but
the last one got me in my side 
it missed my vital
organs  though 
boom 
nice thinking 
destroying my weapons cache
would have definitely
sealed my fate 
ah 
  stab 
  ah  i m less mobile now 
stab  stab 
the first stab
punctures my liver 
i will die from this wound 
but not immediately 
it will be slow and painful 
i m taking you out
with me  though 
slice 
i m cut 
i m bleeding severely 
and  oh  no 
the knife got knocked
out of my hand 
  ah  ah   
  i block the sword 
and tie up your hands
with the garrotte 
not only did that
force me to lose my grip 
but it s also slicing into
the radial artery of my wrist 
ah 
not only is this cutting off
the blood supply to my brain 
but the wire is
slicing into my flesh 
i m dead 
good 
you should have used the gun 
always use the gun
if it s an option 
i know  i just   
i find guns to be
boring and overused 
i know what you mean 
but if it s the difference
between life and death 
it s okay to be boring 
only a week to go 
but i would say
that you re feeling very strong 
both physically  and mentally 
i m going to kill her 
i just know it 
can i help you find anything 
no 
i m just browsing 
well  let me know
if i can help in any way 
wait 
i m looking for
an outfit to die in 
you re in luck 
we just got some pieces in
for the new season
that are to die for 
no  not to die for  to die in 
i m looking for an outfit
that if  hypothetically 
i were to die in 
i would be okay with 
something that reflects my
personality and is functional 
but mainly  i need it
to be flattering to my figure 
i ve gotten in shape
over the past year 
but i still carry insecurities
about my body 
if i m going to die  well 
at least i want to do it
looking my best 
i don t care how much it costs 
fuck 
shit 
what do you mean   postponed  
due to weather 
i don t mind getting wet 
well  the issue isn t rain 
there s a chance
for thunderstorms 
then when 
in a month 
a month 
another thing 
this delay is considered
an act of god 
so you ll need to continue
paying support to your double 
  the double 
  of course 
for another month 
i spent everything
i had yesterday 
on what 
an outfit for the duel 
if you default on your payments 
the court will
assign you a handicap 
such as having to duel with one
arm tied behind your back 
i ll figure something out 
the double has won the duel 
goodbye  sarah 
he s robert michaels now 
how have you been 
good 
i started a new job recently 
hey 
do you like it 
i think i do 
i don t know yet 
  how are you 
  i m okay 
they postponed the duel 
as i m sure you re aware 
i am 
she doesn t talk about
the duel all that much 
i was surprised
you wanted to meet up 
it felt like it was time 
i want to apologize
for how things ended 
i know i said some
really hurtful things there 
i understand 
i took it as you trying
to push me away 
i wanted to see you
and tell you i don t hate you 
i wouldn t want to die
with you thinking i hated you 
i appreciate you saying that 
i m going to try my best
to kill her  though 
and i won t be sorry for it 
i need you to know that 
i know 
should we order
something to eat 
i think that would be nice 
hi  trent 
the duel has been postponed 
can i keep training with you
for another month 
uh  well  i was wondering   
you know how you were
talking about other forms
of payment
that were mutually beneficial 
does that offer still stand 
  and let me see you get low
if you want this thug  
  now take it to the floor
and if your ass wanna act  
  then you can keep your ass
where you re at  
  3  6  9  stand real fine  
  hoping she can sock it to me
one more time  
  get low  get low 
get low  get low  
  to the window  
  to the wall  
   til the sweat drop
down my balls  
don t get frustrated 
let s do it slower 
five  six  seven  eight 
yes  better 
okay  let s do
it from the start 
thank you 
  now  bring your
ass over here  ho  
  and let me see you get low
if you want this thug  
  now take it to the floor
and if your ass wanna act  
  then you can keep your ass
where you re at  
  3  6  9  stand real fine  
  hoping she can sock it to me
one more time  
  get low  get low 
get low  get low  
  to the window  
thank you again for
the hip hop dance lessons 
i ve wanted to take classes
for three years now 
but i ve been too
nervous to start 
i hope you continue dancing
even if i die in my duel 
i ve already signed up
for a beginner group class 
oh  that s good 
i know this isn t ideal
for you to wait
another month to duel
your double to the death 
but look at it as
an opportunity 
try to see the positives 
another month means
another month of training 
do you see this dog here 
the one here on the leash 
hm  his name is connor 
i named him after
my grandfather 
  he s your dog 
  he is 
aw  he looks friendly 
do you see that crossbow there 
  that one 
  yes 
grab it 
stand over there 
shoot my dog 
why 
connor is very old
and very sick 
i don t want to 
it s okay  he s suffering 
he s in an immense
amount of pain 
you ll be putting him
out of his misery 
do it  sarah 
please 
he s in agony 
i can t 
i understand 
i m disappointed
in your killer instincts 
but   
at least my dog is still alive 
what the fuck  sarah  
i m sorry 
hi 
hi 
did you lose her 
did you lose your twin 
yes  i can t find
my twin sister 
she looks exactly like me
because we re twins 
just like you two 
have you seen her 
she s over here 
you don t have
to be scared anymore 
we found your sister 
when i and abby
were really small 
and we went to the store
with mommy 
and a man came up
and wanted to show abby a toy 
i wanted to see the toy  too 
but the man said
that if both of us
would be looking at the toy 
mommy could get scared
that where are we 
when mommy came back 
i told her about the man 
but abby was gone 
abby didn t come for three days 
and they found her in
a parking lot 
i missed her terribly much 
and i cried a lot 
but now 
we are all the time together 
except when she goes to talk
to miss murphy every sunday 
but your sister is here 
and she loves you very much 
girls 
who are you  let go of her 
  sorry 
  mommy 
she asked us to help
to find her twin sister 
i think you should leave 
come on 
i know you re in there 
you re going
to try and murder me 
look  i realize i shot at you 
i ve been training for a year
to kill you  it was instinctual 
you surprised me 
what else would you expect 
we re supposed
to wait until the duel 
i know  open the door 
i promise i won t
try to murder you 
okay 
you almost got me 
even through the glass 
i m surprised i missed 
even through the glass 
i m agile 
can i ask you something 
sure 
when we first met 
all those months ago
when i shook your hand 
why didn t you
look me in the eye 
i m not sure 
i think it was because
i knew what was going to happen 
i mean  i knew i was going
to take over eventually 
and i think i felt
a sense of guilt 
taking over my life
was the plan  not stealing it 
i understand you feel that i
stole it  but it s my life  too 
but it was my life first 
yes  but that doesn t mean
my life matters any less 
  but your life is my life 
  it was your life 
but i ve moved past your life
and made it my own 
yes  but you knowingly stole
everything that made up my life
to make up yours 
i understand that you feel like
i went about it the wrong way 
and to be honest  it s not what
i thought it would be anyway 
what do you mean 
well  peter and i argue about
the littlest things sometimes 
for example  last week 
i wanted to watch
a romantic comedy  and he wanted
to watch a dark comedy 
how can i be with someone
if we can t even agree
on the genre of film
we should watch 
or take our mother 
she acts like i owe her my life 
phone calls  just to talk 
texts asking me   how are you  
one before 9 00 a m  saying 
 i love you very much  
and don t even get me started
on the amount of forwarded
social media posts
that are only moderately funny 
they already have a day for
mothers  isn t that enough 
what are you trying to say 
i m still not sure 
it s your life now 
i ve moved on 
and i m making a new one 
i m still going
to kill you in the duel 
but i ll make it quicker
and less painful
than i had originally planned 
i want to take you somewhere 
where 
we re a little late 
i pushed him and he fell over 
he held up his hands
as a shield 
i will never forget
the screams he made 
sorry 
that s all right 
please come take a seat 
carl had just started to tell us
about how he s been feeling 
since his duel 
i can t remember
exactly where i was 
my memory isn t
what it used to be 
in the moment  shooting
my double in the face
didn t make me feel bad 
i knew it was him or me 
seeing his brain on that grass
meant that i was going
to get to spend more time
with my children
and grandchildren 
it s been three years 
but i still wake up
from nightmares 
i cry in my sleep 
that s why my wife
sleeps on the couch 
she can t stand
to see me this way 
sometimes i wonder 
what was the point
of fighting to live   
if this is the life i m living 
nice try 
your mental tricks
aren t going to work on me 
nothing you do or say
or he does or says
or they do or say
is going to keep me
from surviving this whole mess 
it s not like that 
believe me when i say that
i m going to do my very best
to kill you  too 
just like i ve also
definitely been training to do 
i just wanted you
to see people like us
and hear their experiences 
whichever one of us lives
is going to have to
live with this
for the rest of our life 
your double s name
is sarah s double 
so i can only assume
your name is sarah 
i m daryl  the group leader 
i m responsible for starting
the check in process 
and i ensure individuals
stay on topic 
i also introduce the arts and
crafts activity of the meeting 
perhaps we should
move along to that 
everyone raise
their non dominant hand 
i want you to use this hand
to compose a letter
to your original 
or to your double 
depending on which one you are 
this is to help you connect
to a part of you that
could also feel like it belongs
to another person
at the same time 
you see where
i m going with this 
 i had only two days
of imprintation with you 
 you let me discover
your lifeless body
in a bath of red 
lukewarm water  
 i didn t know how to be you 
i still don t  
 i don t like the people
you forced me to live with 
it makes me depressed  
 i want to kill myself  too  
 but we all know there cannot be
doubles of doubles  
 and even though
i didn t choose to be made 
i don t want to let anyone down
like you did  
 best   
larry  
 most people would look down
upon what we had 
but it was better than anything
they will ever know 
we knew each other
intrinsically 
better than if you knew
someone else an entire lifetime 
i still miss your touch 
 i m sorry you had to die  
i would like to go next 
 sarah    
what you said in there 
i m still at a loss 
i mean  the way you eloquently
accepted all the blame 
the way you effectively argued
that the real enemy
isn t each other 
it s a system that arbitrarily
decides only one of us can live
and that has us
fight to the death
as some sort of sick
spectator sport 
i m sure you wrote something
similar in your letter 
maybe you ll read it
for me someday 
yeah 
and you re right 
we actually have
a lot in common 
a lot  like being
good at swimming 
and we both have great breasts 
exactly 
why should one of
us have to die 
why can t we be together 
i m not saying we should fuck
like that one guy in there
obviously did with his double 
but why can t we both live 
do you mean that 
i m glad you know how to drive 
i never learned 
it seems easy enough  though 
you just press forward
on the right one 
and you stop by pulling it back 
no  you press the pedal
to the left of it to brake 
huh  that makes sense 
and you change directions
with that round thing 
turning it to the right
makes the car go right 
and turning it to the left
makes it go left 
see  easy enough 
comfortable clothing 
  check 
  backpacks 
yours is smaller than
i was expecting 
i have everything i need 
check 
  no weapons 
  none 
i didn t bring any either 
if it s all right with you 
i d like to make sure
you didn t bring any 
i don t want to do it here
on the side of the road 
maybe when we take
our first break 
that s fine with me 
i d like to check your pack 
too  for peace of mind 
of course 
rations  check 
and water 
yes  last on the list is water 
i have it  check 
let s drink some
before we begin walking 
i don t think i have
to remind you
of the importance of
staying hydrated 
let s take another
bigger drink just to be safe 
thank you 
i wonder what will happen
when we both don t show up
for the duel 
one of the combatants in a duel
has failed to show up
before out of fear 
but they re almost always
later found and arrested 
some try to get plastic surgery
in order to look different 
but i found out from trent
that once we re a part
of the replacement program 
any attempts to contact
a plastic surgeon are flagged 
there s always the black market 
though  but you are taking
a big risk getting
a black market face transplant 
as far as i know 
there has never been a duel
where both the original
and the double are no shows 
they ll send dogs after us 
but we ll be across
the border by then 
once we cross the border 
we ll be safe 
i m incredibly thankful
you came and found me 
and to think  just a few
weeks ago  i wanted you dead 
i m so glad we re both
in such good shape 
we would have needed
many more rests already
had we not been training
this past year 
yes 
i agree 
sorry i m late 
which one are you 
the original  sarah 
where have you been 
i had a little car trouble 
what kind of car trouble 
i accidentally mistook the wheel
that turns the car right or left
for the pedal
that stops the car 
i m fine  should we begin 
we can t start yet 
why not 
because your double isn t here 
really 
actually  that sounds
just like her 
she didn t take this duel
very seriously 
i bet she hasn t even
been training for it 
you should probably
let your superiors know 
she s likely trying to flee 
yes 
i m afraid not  ma am 
just the original 
i have reason to believe
this is a code negative one 
and do you  sir  swear that 
to the best of your knowledge 
having known her
emotionally and intimately 
that this is the original sarah 
i do 
and do you swear
beyond the shadow of any
reasonable doubt
that the person before us today
is the daughter that gestated
inside you for nine months
and you raised for 18 years 
your own flesh and blood 
this is my sarah  your honor 
and  finally 
do you solemnly swear
that you are
who you say you are 
i m sarah 
i think i have a new wrinkle
and two new sunspots 
i m sure you don t 
i can count  peter 
there s exactly one new wrinkle
on my face and two new sunspots 
well  you have to start
using sunscreen 
and not just when
you re going to the beach
or when you re
walking around a theme park 
it has to be daily 
your skin is more
sensitive than others  
and you have to start
taking better care of yourself 
i don t mean to sound
insensitive  but   
it s only going to get
a lot harder from here 
as long as men take
moderate care of themselves 
they tend to peak later in life 
women  on the other hand 
have a much smaller window
in which they re deemed to be
at their peak attractiveness 
and don t worry  sweetheart 
i m gonna love you
no matter how you look 
even with that genetic mutation
that causes premature
graying and hair loss 
should i buy more hair dye
for you while i m out 
no  i ll get some
on my way home from work 
remember to keep making
at least the minimum payment
on the replacement loan 
i know  peter 
where should we go
for dinner tonight 
how about mexican food 
i don t like mexican food 
aren t you going to answer that 
she s my mom  not yours 
hi  sarah 
this is your mother
just calling to talk 
i must have just missed you 
you re probably just walking
out the door of your house   
getting into your car 
ready to start another
day at your job 
which you love 
i just wanted you to know 
i went ahead and ordered
another box of contacts
from the optometrist 
the colored ones
aren t always in stock 
so it s best to
order ahead of time 
i know you re still getting
settled back into your life 
so i figured something
as simple as new contacts
might slip through the cracks
