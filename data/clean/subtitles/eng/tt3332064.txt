about a boy
who would never grow up
about the pirate
who wished to kill him
about the island
where fairies roamed
but this is not the story
you have heard before
because sometimes
friends begin as enemies
and enemies begin as friends
sometimes you truly understand
how things end
we must first know
how they begin

your festering souls
your souls that fester

i have sucked
these mines dry
there is almost nothing left
i must have their lands

can seem to find
yet you assure me all will
be given the proper time
there is no time none
excuse me captain

dirty feverish on the
brink of collapse sir

they are forming
in a straight line
they are going through
a tight wind
no no

in the backseat
they are generating
steam heat
pulsating to
the back beat
the blitzkrieg bop
any clearer now
hey ho let us go
hey ho let us go
yeah
brave heroes of neverland
behold these traitors
i entrust their fate
to your gracious whim

in fact it is rather
frightening
agree
are you brave peter
i try to be
yes of course
are you scared
yes
have you ever flown before
no
beyond that wall
there are savage people
they have an
ancient prophecy
from when the fairy kingdoms
reigned on this island
the prophecy tells of a boy
born of the love
between a fairy prince
and a human girl
a boy who would be
disappeared from this world
until he was old enough
to return and lead
an uprising against me

on the island
it is not a negotiation kid
without me you are
stuck in this cell

minor technicality
someday could be today
if you think about it
and
smee
yes
that is where we are headed
the skyport
we can take one of
the cable cars up to the dock
then you will fly
us to a ship
okay
keep your head down kid
go go
see they anchor the galleons
far enough off the dock
so they are impossible
to steal
so you want me to fly from the
dock over to one of the
what speak now
or forever hold your peace
have we meant to stop
whoa
heave heave
forget the skyport
you have to do it now
are you waiting
for a formal invitation

for the last time
might we bicker
about this later
smee the sword

get up there
and wave it at them
heave
that was close
do you know how
to work a ship
how hard could it be
smee the rope

than it looks
yeah we are sailing now
well do you have
anything to say
i worked hard setting
up that table

to the natives

of us winning this war
all will be lost
we will find them sir
they cannot have gone far

dead ahead
smee get off my leg
i think i am going

you said we would
find my mother
i am not leaving neverland
well not now anyway
get the sails up
the sails
this is going to be
a little rough
put the sails up
how many times
i am not to be disturbed
when i am at the rejuvenation
yes
i am sorry captain
however it is about the boy
the stolen ship went down
in the never wood
so the boy is lost
yes sir he is a lost boy
but our best men are
searching for him now
imbeciles surround me
must i do everything myself
sir you cannot
really believe
that this squeak is the one
he hardly seems capable
his mother hardly
seemed capable either
and yet here we are
the deal was to help me
to find my mother
you were going to break it
that is very wrong
no you broke the deal first
you lied to us
no i fibbed i can fly
just not every day
whoa
our only way off this island
and now it is in pieces
satisfied
well yes i am
quite content
because i do not want to
get off this island
all the years that i have
wasted planning to get out
all gone
hey quit messing around
it is not safe in here
every ship has one
a what
a map
what does that say
tribal territory
exactly
the prophecy said
a boy would lead the tribe
so what you do not care
i do keep going
well blackbeard thinks
the prophecy is about me
which means my mom
is from here
this means the natives
might know where she is
are you insane
if those savages would just
kill you i help you
ever met one
no
and i do not plan to meet
well they might be very nice
i am not afraid of them
there is a fine line between
bravery and suicide kid
i am going off to find the tribal
territory goodbye
he will not last an hour
out there
his problem not ours
thing in this if he
was the chosen one
if that prophecy is real
trust me he is not it
but if they thought he was
they believed he was
i bet they would
handsomely reward
anyone who brought him
to them
well they do not
have a ship
yeah but they could get one
who has fought the pirates
more than the natives
if anyone could find a way
it is they
just remember
when we find those
so sweet natured locals
true or not you tell them
you are their savior
then we will go our
separate ways got it
why would you want to leave
a place like this
where will you go
i do not know somewhere
i am a little higher up
on the food chain
for starters
what was that
something a little higher up
on the food chain
that is pretty hook
do you see that
we got pirates trying
to shoot us down with cannons
nearly falling a thousand feet
to our deaths
twice shipwrecked
and you see something
like that
and you think to yourself
worth it
are you an orphan
my mom left me that count
well do you remember her
i am not wasting tears missing
someone who never missed me
maybe she does
how can you know
do you really believe
your mom is here
well she left me
a note saying
well if she left
you a note sure
just because yours
never loved you

the pan is our tribes
bravest warrior
it is our tradition to grant
you the chance to win
your freedom before
we kill you and your friends
kill what do
you mean kill
you are our sworn enemy
you are pirates
pirates we are not
pirates hold on
the kid is the one
you have been waiting

your fiercest fighter
against ours our pan
you win you live

i get the idea
bye for now
pan
so how do we know
when we to start
whoa
whoa
whoa
smee
what
we have to tell them
about my mother
no one cares about
your darn mother
sorry that was a bit harsh
okay
your highness
i was hoping to
get you alone
stop
the little one
he wears the pan
he is a boy that can fly
i have seen it
it is terrific
we call this the memory tree
it was a time of war
blackbeard destroyed
everything in pursuit
of the pixum
but then the chief
made a pact
with the great fairy king
uniting our peoples
against the pirates
one night the kings son
the fairy prince
found his way onto
blackbeards ship
her name was mary
the love of blackbeards life
and his most prized
possession
night after night
the prince visited mary
but when blackbeard
discovered them
he flew into a jealous rage
so in order to save her
the prince took human form
but though fairies can live
many thousands of years
in human flesh
they can live only one day
the prince sacrificed his life
for the girl he loved
and the child of that love
was you
our people helped your mother
hide you in the other world
and they made
you this totem
so that when you returned
we would know it was you
what happened to my mother
she returned to the never wood
and fought for us many years
and
the pirates we have
winning the war
and the fairies had to retreat
to a hidden kingdom
they have remained there
in hiding
unknown by blackbeard
until a time when they can
reemerge and fight
and my mother
she is with them
she is alive
are you sure
i have to go to her
please take me now
no
you must be patient
however she is waiting for me
the fairy kingdom is the
greatest secret of this land
our duty is to protect it
before we take you there
you must prove us
to be marys son
the one we have been waiting
when the third moon rises
he must fly
if he lives
he is the one
one second
and if he dies
he is an imposter
his death will be justified
three days
i have the necklace
is not that enough
you could have stolen it
however i did not tell her
kid has always
had that thing
how long have you known him
three days
all my life
the flying thing
is a stupid detail
why cannot they
just see that
if you do not believe peter
then neither wills them
but if you do they will too
i promise
are you whom
they think you are
i do not know
hey
they think you are
their messiah
that you are here
to liberate them
are they right
i said i do not know
rabbits
i believe
i can fly
if only nibs was here
he would know how to help
i believe
have you seen smee
the things they
expect me to do
i cannot do them hook
i have tried
hey stop hey
i cannot do the things
therefore i cannot
be the one
listen
hook what the
bloody hell is i
you can go feeling sorry for
yourself all you want kid
however knowing
where you are from
that is half of knowing
who you are
that is more than most of us
here will ever know
however you said that
your mother left you
yeah i lied
i do that sometimes
it has called being
a grownup
least you know
where you do from
born to a warrior
to a prince
does that mean you are the one
i do not know
i do not know
if there is a one
but i do know
that if you are not
the person
and you are just you
maybe that is enough
where is the boy
spill the beans
or i will spill your blood
i will never tell
he is right over there
nope nope wait my mistake
sure it is that way no
no right the first time
definitely maybe definitely
this way
the point is
we are very close
ready the ships
bishop kills him
no just wait
wait
you might not want to
kill me just yet
for i hold the crown jewels
you know
information ally
speak
sorry a bit nervous
you are quite intimidating
speak
now you know the socalled
extinct fairy kingdom
speak
sorry
i was just looking for you
well you found me
do not see things
like that in the mines
kind of beautiful
so do you like sunrises
what is it you think
you are doing
well i think it has
called flirting
however if you have to ask it
i might be doing it wrong
you are not like the men
from my tribe
thank you
no they are honest
strong brave
brave
that what you call it
letting my little buddy
take a leap to his death
when he ceases to doubt himself
he will fly
how do we know
there are any fairies
still left on this island
or that they will come
help fight
just because they see him fly
you have to trust us
why should we
you certainly do not trust us
there is a map to
the fairy kingdom
we guard it with our lives
of course there is
why would not there be a secret
map to the secret kingdom
this is not a game
you have seen what blackbeard
has done to neverland already
he will reduce the rest of it
to nothing but mine pits
if we do not stop him

beautiful eyes

from your destiny
whoever it is you think i am
whatever it is you
expect me to be
i am not
and i cannot
i could not
i did not want
to watch you die
you should have
closed your eyes
blackbeard will not
stop searching for peter
there is only one place
on this island
he would not dare look

therefore pirates are
afraid of mermaids
because of what we will pass
through to get there

than i am
i am sorry i did not tell you
what happened to your mother
however blackbeard did not tell
you the whole truth either
let me show you
the mermaids charged
these waters with memories
you can see the past
deep breath
there is no time
blackbeards men
nearly have us
go to the fairy kingdom hide
keep our people safe
you should never have
come back mary
yet here you are
ready to die for them all
rather than live with me
no mary
no no
no
she was a warrior
a great warrior her sacrifice
still inspires us
did you know her
she trained me
would she have been
proud of me
yes
very
however what if i cannot do
what she did
what if i fail to
fulfill the prophecy
and what if you fail
to try peter
what are you then
hey
you have to see this
now the hulls a
little banged up
and see those teeth marks
boy those crocks can jump
however once i get her fixed up
she is going to be in good shape
for what
to get us the hell
off this island
you are going to
run like a coward
well i never really thought
of it in those exact terms
however generally
speaking yes
and where will you go
home it is you know
where i come from
home is not where you come from
it is where you make it
so help me do that
anyone that survived blackbeards
attack is in the mine by now
and i have been in there
i am not going back
not for anything or anyone
well if you have no
reason to stay then go
go now leave us to die
i do not want you to die
i want you to come with me
and if i do not
then that is your decision
not mine
well kid
looks like the old gang
is back together
let us get this
ship in the air
let us get one
thing straight
i am not the chosen one
the prophecy was not about me
if it was never real at all
but i am my mothers son
if blackbeard is going to destroy
everything my parents died for
i will stand against him to the
last just like they did
now
take me to the fairy kingdom
it is just as the
chief described it
these are words
what language is it
must be fairy
i can read
i can read it
what does it say
only the prince who bears
the key shall pass
just that
then some boring stuff about
the great fallen dead
it means we need a key
then this was all for nothing
no i would not say that
the prince who bears the key
do not you see peter
i am the
you are bear the key
i am
you have had it all along
she knew i would come for her
yes
mom tries to protect the kingdom
by giving your son the key
i kill mom but fail
to kill the son
in turn son fails to protect the
kingdom by giving me the key
mom would be
very disappointed
would not she
eternity beckons
i will live forever
wakey wakey rise and shine
that is where we are going
the fairy hive
destroy that and we
destroy them all
yes
yes come on
come on come

her name is tinkerbell
i can hear her
they have been waiting
for you peter

away from here
he is going to destroy you all
i know what i have meant to do
but i failed
i am sorry

and burn them

of honor boy

warrior and a prince
