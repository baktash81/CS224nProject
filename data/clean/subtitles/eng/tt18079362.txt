hello  my name is betty   
elizabeth bachman 
look  i crunched the numbers
and based on your viewership 
my friends and i have
about a  00013  chance here 
so  i realize that
the probability
of me winning this contest is very 
very low    betty  s husband  honey 
but i used to be a professor
of applied mathematics at mit 
back when there were
only two other women
in the whole department 
so i  m used to
the odds being against me 
honey 
i have to run to class 
have you seen my watch 
it  s on the mantel
over the fireplace 
you  re also gonna need pants 
pants  oh 
right 
what would i do without you 
i just really need this trip 
thank you very much 
oh  what do you think
of my    my paper 
i  m gonna submit it
to the journal 
look  i love
your principal points  i do 
but the whole paper right now
is rather confusing 
and you can  t expect
people to understand
unless you weave
the concepts together
a bit better and   
pants 
yep  pants  right 
hi  my name is maura 
and my friends and i
are die hard pats fans 
which wasn  t always the case
growing up in oregon 
where my mother
was a lumberjack    that  s great 
but if we want
the advantage here 
it has to sound like
a real story 
so let  s keep it believable 
right 
  all right  sure  maura 
  okay 
but she really was a lumberjack 
 resident  being bullied in
elementary school was hard 
and then when
middle school came 
things got much worse 
much  much worse 
and my mom started
picking on me too    uh    uh   
don  t make it so sad 
it  s about the best story wins 
not the saddest story 
okay 
thank you 
 resident 2  hello 
yes 
uh  my name is maura 
and my three friends
and i are dying 
thank you 
okay  bye bye 
we  re    we  re dying
to go to the super bowl 
  oh  right 
  yeah 
  oopsie 
  mmm 
yeah 
hey  maura 
thank you for including me
in all of this 
this is a lot of fun 
oh  good   chuckles 
hey  do you think
you could round up
some more residents 
because some of
these performances
aren  t helping our odds 
you got it 
thanks  mick 
i mean  this guy
is like caesar  no  he  s perfect 
and he  s like genghis khan 
 lou   my friends and i
are die hard     no  no 
 my best friends and i
are die hard pats fans 
we  re all ladies over 80
who love tom brady 
twenty years ago 
we didn  t know anything    
no  no  no 
 it was 16 years ago 
i  d just finished
my last round of chemo 
and my three best friends
had come over to cheer me up  
how about some tv 
mmm 
 cheering 
 announcer 
so third down and ten now 
big play for the patriots  i
can  t change the channels 
oh  i can do it 
 chuckles 
 announcer continues 
yeah  it  s not working 
remote  s been acting funny 
i got it 
 announcer 
shaun ellis  92   
 volume increases 
was carrying    oh 
 maura  what do i do

 shouting

hold on 
two minutes left in this game 
drew bledsoe is out 
they  re gonna have to go
with their backup qb 
tom brady  the second year
quarterback from
the university of michigan 
who  s that 
i think anybody could tell
by looking at bledsoe   
he is cute 
oh  i  ll watch this 
i can turn myself down 
 announcer continues 
 lou   maybe it was luck 
maybe it was destiny 
but at that moment 
the patriots  
backup quarterback
got called off the bench  
 betty  i think
that has to be so difficult 
oh  my god 
 lou   we eventually
got the remote working 
and one week of football
became two  
you know  for a game
where a bunch of guys
just smash into each other 
it  s really very complicated 
there are so many patterns 
and if you analyze the data 
you will find   
we  re just starting
to enjoy it  betty 
don  t make it about math 
oh  okay 
 lou   and two weeks
became a season  
 all exclaiming 
 tom and the patriots
went on to win
the super bowl that year 
and i  well  i  m still here 
thanks to my team  
and to lou 
our quarterback  screams 
 laughing

feeling like i was done 
like i had nothing more in me 
and then you came on the tv 
fearless  determined 
a skinny little rookie 
watching you play that season
gave me something extra
to look forward to 
each week 
i found strength in that 
and that strength got me
through my treatments 
but that was 16 years ago 
and i  ve enjoyed
every moment since 
and i  m sure you enjoyed
winning all those super bowls 
but that was the past 
and we can  t live in the past 
no matter how good
or how bad it was 
right now
we have this one moment 
and you  re down
in this game  a lot 
but you  re tom brady 
you have to come back 
that  s what you do best 
and i love you
because you are the best 
and anyone who doesn  t
love you respects you
because you fight
and you never give up 
so i  m not giving up either
