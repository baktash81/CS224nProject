hello my name is betty
elizabeth bachman
look i crunched the numbers
and based on your viewership
my friends and i have
about a 00013 chance here
so i realize that
the probability
of me winning this contest is very
very lowbettys husband honey
but i used to be a professor
of applied mathematics at mit
back when there were
only two other women
in the whole department
so im used to
the odds being against me
honey
i have to run to class
have you seen my watch
its on the mantel
over the fireplace
youre also gonna need pants
pants oh
right
what would i do without you
i just really need this trip
thank you very much
oh what do you think
of my my paper
im gonna submit it
to the journal
look i love
your principal points i do
but the whole paper right now
is rather confusing
and you cant expect
people to understand
unless you weave
the concepts together
a bit better and
pants
yep pants right
hi my name is maura
and my friends and i
are diehard pats fans
which wasnt always the case
growing up in oregon
where my mother
was a lumberjack thats great
but if we want
the advantage here
it has to sound like
a real story
so lets keep it believable
right
all right sure maura
okay
but she really was a lumberjack
resident being bullied in
elementary school was hard
and then when
middle school came
things got much worse
much much worse
and my mom started
picking on me too uh uh
dont make it so sad
its about the best story wins
not the saddest story
okay
thank you
resident 2 hello

oh ill watch this

just smash into each other
its really very complicated
there are so many patterns
