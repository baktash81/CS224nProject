damn it childs torch it
oh my god
oh
look son of a bitch oh
you see what were talking about here
is an organism
that imitates other lifeforms
and it imitates them perfectly
when this thing attacked our dogs
it tried to digest them
absorb them
and in the process
shape its own cells to imitate them
this for instance thats not dog
its imitation
we got to it before it had time to finish
finish what
finish imitating these dogs
easy easy good
easy easy
clark
yeah
did you notice anything strange
about the dog anything at all
strange no
what was the dog doing in the rec room
i dont know
he was just wandering around camp all day
are you saying to me the dog wasnt put
in the kennel until last night
right
how long were you alone with that dog
i dont know an hour
hour and a half maybe
what the hell you looking at me
like that for
i dont know
what
i dont know its probably nothing
its nothing at all
how much more of this crap is there
oh about nine hours id say
we cant learn anything from this
guess not
whered they take these shots
seems like they were spending
a lot of their time
in a little place northeast of their camp
about five or six miles
whats that
it looks like something
buried under the ice
and look at that
theyre planting thermite charges
whatever it was it was bigger
than that block of ice you found
here this is it the place where
they were spending most of their time
pretty nasty out mac 35 knots
screw it im gonna go up anyway
half a mile due east
jesus how long do you figure
this has been in the ice
well the backscatter effects been
bringing things up
from way down around here for a long time
id say id say the ice its buried in is
100000 years old at least
and those norwegians blew it up
yeah
i dont know
thousands of years ago it crashes
and this thing
gets thrown out or crawls out
and it ends up freezing in the ice
i just cannot believe
any of this voodoo bullshit
childs it happens all the time man
theyre falling out of the skies like flies
government knows all about it
right mac
do you believe
any of this voodoo bullshit blair
childs childs chariots of the gods man
they practically own south america
i mean they taught the incas
everything they know
come on now macready
the norwegians get a hold of this
and they dig it up out of the ice
yes garry they dig it up they cart it back
it gets thawed out wakes up
not in the best of moods
i dont know i wasnt there
which one of you disrespectful men
been tossing his dirty drawers
in the kitchen trash can huh
from now on
i want my kitchen clean germfree
now hows this motherfucker wake up
after thousands of years in the ice
and how could it look like a dog
i dont know how
cause its different than us see

theres something wrong with blair
hes locked himself in his room
and he wont answer the door
so i took one of his notebooks from the lab

listen
it could have imitated
a million lifeforms on a million planets
could change into any one of them
at any time
now it wants lifeforms on earth
its getting cold in here
and i havent slept in days
wait
it needs to be alone and in close proximity
with a lifeform to be absorbed
the chameleon strikes in the dark
so is blair cracking up or what
damn it macready
there is still cellular activity
in these burned remains
theyre not dead yet
lets go bennings i gotta get some sleep

for your own protection blair
how you doing old boy
i dont know who to trust

tell you what
why dont you just trust in the lord
watch clark
what
i said watch clark
and watch him close do you hear me
and now the radios gone
and so are the choppers
were completely cut off
all we can do now is hole up
til spring wait for the rescue team
no we dont wait
somebody in this camp
aint what he appears to be
right now that may be one or two of us
by spring it could be all of us
so how do we know whos human
if i was an imitation a perfect imitation
how would you know if it was really me
is there some kind of test doc
well yeah possibly
ive been thinking about a blood serum test
whats that
we could take a sample of each persons
blood mix it with uncontaminated blood
i suppose if theres a reaction
wed know who isnt human
weve got whole blood in storage
start working on it
keep an eye on clark
he was close to that dog
yeah
yeah
mac we need blairs help
hes the only one who knows this organism
hes too far gone
but get the rest of his notebooks
start going through them
garry hey you guys come here
what
somebody got to the blood
what
wheres clark
right here
wait a minute was this broken into
the lock is undamaged
somebody opened it closed it
then locked it
great
whos got access to it
i guess im the only one
and i got the only key
would that test have worked doc
i think so yes
somebody else
sure as hell thought so
well who else couldve used that key
nobody i just give it to copper
whenever he needs it
could anybody have gotten it from you
doc
i dont see how as soon as im finished
i return it right away
great
when was the last time you used it
day or so ago
i suppose somebody could have
lifted it off me
oh come on
that key ring of yours
is always hooked to your belt
accusing everybody
stop it it aint worth it
coppers the only one
whos got any business with it
wait a minute
youve been in here on several occasions
doc thought of the test
so what
is that supposed to clear him
windows windows
put that down
no
ill put this right through your head
you guys gonna listen to garry
you gonna let him give the orders
he could be one of those things
windows
wait a minute just take it easy
put the gun down
put it down
you dont want to hurt anybody
right
on the floor
its on the floor
i dont know about copper
but i give you my word
i did not go near that blood
but i guess youll all feel a little easier
if somebody else was in charge
norris i cant see anybody objecting to you
im sorry fellas but im not up to it
ill take it
like hell you will
it should be somebody
a little more eventempered childs
all right
i know im human
and if you were all these things
then youd just attack me right now
so some of you are still human
this thing doesnt want to show itself
it wants to hide inside an imitation
itll fight if it has to
but its vulnerable out in the open
if it takes us over
then it has no more enemies
nobody left to kill it
and then its won
theres a storm hitting us in six hours
were gonna find out whos who
all right doc garry and clark
move over there away from the others
norris you and childs
shoot them up with morphine
tie them down in the rec room
and watch them
fuchs you start working
on a new technique
i need docs help
you dont wanna drug me
mac im not a prisoner
let me do it
youre gonna break the needle in my arm
no doc hes doing a real fine job
im gonna hide this tape when im finished
if none of us make it
at least therell be some kind of record
storms been hitting us hard now
for 48 hours
we still have nothing to go on
one other thing
i think it rips through your clothes
when it takes you over
windows found some shredded long johns
but the name tag was missing
they could be anybodys
nobody
nobody trusts anybody now
and were all very tired
nobody trusts anybody now
theres nothing else i can do
just wait
rj macready helicopter pilot
us outpost number 31
you come up with anything yet
one or two ideas
but macready ive been thinking
if a small particle of this thing
is enough to take over an entire organism
then everyone should prepare
their own meals
and i suggest we only eat out of cans
all right
whos that
anybody see fuchs
somebody blew out a fuse in the lab
lights were out for an hour
anyone of us couldve gotten to him
all right we gotta find him

you tie up palmer over here
were gonna draw
a little bit of everybodys blood
cause were gonna find out
whos the thing
watching norris in there
gave me the idea that
maybe every part of him was a whole
every little piece was an individual animal
with a builtin desire to protect its own life
you see when a man bleeds
its just tissue
the blood from one of you things
wont obey when its attacked
itll try and survive
crawl away from a hot needle the same

and were not with him burn him
mac the doors open
howd he get out
the door was bolted from the outside
blair
hey blair you down there

blairs been busy out here
all by himself

something hes been making
its a ship of some kind
he stole the parts from the helicopter
the smart sob put it together
piece by piece
where was he trying to go
anyplace but here
hey you guys come here come here
i think i saw childs outside
the main entrance of the camp
whats he doing outside
i dont know
got a flare
he got back inside and blew the generator
in six hours
itll be a hundred below in here
well thats suicide
not for that thing it wants to freeze now
its got no way out of here
it just wants to go to sleep in the cold
until the rescue team finds it
what can we do what can we do
whether we make it or not
we cant let that thing freeze again
maybe well just warm things up
a little around here
were not getting out of here alive
but neither is that thing
generator room
the generators gone
any way we can fix it
its gone macready
all right
we gotta bring this whole place
right down into the ice
garry plant yours in the old storage room
nauls down by the generator
god
hows it coming in there
i said hows it
yeah fuck you too
you the only one who made it
not the only one
did you kill it
where were you childs
thought i saw blair
i went out after him
and got lost in the storm
fires got the temperature up
all over the camp
wont last long though
neither will we
how will we make it
maybe we shouldnt
if youre worried about me
if weve got any surprises for each other
i dont think were in much shape
