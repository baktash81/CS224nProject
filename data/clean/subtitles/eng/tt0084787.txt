a normal set of internal organs 
heart 
lungs  kidneys  liver 
intestines 
seem to be normal 
one  door number two
and door number three 
and i think that dawn screen here
has got the one to trade in the most 
i went to you first

burn it 
damn it  childs  torch it 
oh  my god 
oh 
look  son of a bitch  oh 
you see  what we re talking about here
is an organism
that imitates other life forms 
and it imitates them perfectly 
when this thing attacked our dogs 
it tried to digest them 
absorb them 
and in the process 
shape its own cells to imitate them 
this  for instance    that s not dog 
it s imitation 
we got to it before it had time to finish 
finish what 
finish imitating these dogs 
easy  easy  good 
easy  easy 
  clark 
  yeah 
did you notice anything strange
about the dog  anything at all 
strange  no 
what was the dog doing in the rec room 
i don t know 
he was just wandering around camp all day 
are you saying to me the dog wasn t put
in the kennel until last night 
right 
how long were you alone with that dog 
i don t know  an hour 
hour and a half  maybe 
what the hell you looking at me
like that for 
  i don t know 
  what 
i don t know  it s probably nothing 
it s nothing at all 
how much more of this crap is there 
oh  about nine hours  i d say 
  we can t learn anything from this 
  guess not 
where d they take these shots 
seems like they were spending
a lot of their time
in a little place northeast of their camp
about five or six miles 
what s that 
it looks like something
buried under the ice 
and look at that 
they re planting thermite charges 
whatever it was  it was bigger
than that block of ice you found 
here  this is it  the place where
they were spending most of their time 
  pretty nasty out  mac  35 knots 
  screw it  i m gonna go up anyway 
half a mile due east 
jesus  how long do you figure
this has been in the ice 
well  the backscatter effect s been
bringing things up
from way down around here for a long time 
i d say    i d say the ice it s buried in is
100 000 years old  at least 
  and those norwegians blew it up 
  yeah 
i don t know 
thousands of years ago  it crashes 
and this thing   
gets thrown out or crawls out 
and it ends up freezing in the ice 
i just cannot believe
any of this voodoo bullshit 
childs  it happens all the time  man 
they re falling out of the skies like flies 
government knows all about it 
right  mac 
do you believe
any of this voodoo bullshit  blair 
childs  childs  chariots of the gods  man 
they practically own south america 
i mean  they taught the incas
everything they know 
come on  now  macready 
the norwegians get a hold of this 
and they dig it up out of the ice 
yes  garry  they dig it up  they cart it back 
it gets thawed out  wakes up 
not in the best of moods 
  i don t know  i wasn t there 
  which one of you disrespectful men
been tossing his dirty drawers
in the kitchen trash can  huh 
from now on
i want my kitchen clean  germfree 
now how s this motherfucker wake up
after thousands of years in the ice 
  and how could it look like a dog 
  i don t know how 
 cause it s different than us  see 
 cause it s from outer space 
what do you want from me  ask him 
you buy any of this  blair 
mac  removing those things
out of the lab into the storeroom 
can you come get your stuff 
be there in a minute  doc

there s something wrong with blair 
he s locked himself in his room 
and he won t answer the door 
so i took one of his notebooks from the lab 
  yeah 
  listen 
 it could have imitated
a million life forms on a million planets 
 could change into any one of them
at any time 
 now it wants life forms on earth  
it s getting cold in here 
and i haven t slept in days 
wait 
 it needs to be alone and in close proximity
with a life form to be absorbed 
 the chameleon strikes in the dark  
  so is blair cracking up  or what 
  damn it  macready 
 there is still cellular activity
in these burned remains 
 they re not dead yet

garry  wait a minute  wait a minute 
now  childs  go around to
the map room door  talk to him 
okay 
norris  get a table from the lab 
do you think that thing
wanted to be an animal 
no dogs make it a thousand miles
through the cold 
nah  you don t understand 
that thing wanted to be us 
if the cell gets out
it could imitate everything
on the face of the earth
  and it s not gonna stop 
  okay  blair 
come on  man 
you don t wanna hurt anybody 
i ll kill you 
good shot  macready 
  excuse me 
  okay 
  all right  bring him up 
  yeah 
come on  blair 
what about your shack 
i don t want him in my shack 
we ll lock him in the toolshed 
  why am i in here 
  for your own protection  blair 
how you doing  old boy 
i don t know who to trust 
i know what you mean  blair 
trust s a tough thing to come by these days 
tell you what 
why don t you just trust in the lord 
  watch clark 
  what 
i said  watch clark 
and watch him close  do you hear me 
and now the radio s gone 
  and so are the choppers 
  we re completely cut off 
all we can do now is hole up
 til spring  wait for the rescue team 
no  we don t wait 
somebody in this camp
ain t what he appears to be 
right now that may be one or two of us 
by spring  it could be all of us 
so how do we know who s human 
if i was an imitation  a perfect imitation 
how would you know if it was really me 
is there some kind of test  doc 
well  yeah  possibly 
i ve been thinking about a blood serum test 
what s that 
we could take a sample of each person s
blood  mix it with uncontaminated blood 
i suppose if there s a reaction 
we d know who isn t human 
  we ve got whole blood in storage 
  start working on it 
keep an eye on clark 
he was close to that dog 
  yeah 
  yeah 
mac  we need blair s help 
he s the only one who knows this organism 
he s too far gone 
but get the rest of his notebooks 
start going through them 
garry  hey  you guys  come here 
  what 
  somebody got to the blood 
what 
  where s clark 
  right here 
  wait a minute  was this broken into 
  the lock is undamaged 
somebody opened it  closed it 
then locked it 
great 
who s got access to it 
i guess i m the only one 
and i got the only key 
  would that test have worked  doc 
  i think so  yes 
somebody else
sure as hell thought so 
well  who else could ve used that key 
nobody  i just give it to copper
whenever he needs it 
could anybody have gotten it from you 
doc 
i don t see how  as soon as i m finished 
i return it right away 
great 
  when was the last time you used it 
  day or so ago 
i suppose somebody could have
lifted it off me   
oh  come on 
that key ring of yours
is always hooked to your belt 
accusing everybody   
stop it  it ain t worth it 
copper s the only one
who s got any business with it 
wait a minute 
you ve been in here on several occasions 
doc thought of the test 
so what 
is that supposed to clear him 
windows  windows 
put that down 
  no 
  i ll put this right through your head 
you guys gonna listen to garry 
you gonna let him give the orders 
he could be one of those things 
windows 
wait a minute  just take it easy 
put the gun down 
put it down 
you don t want to hurt anybody 
right 
on the floor 
it s on the floor 
i don t know about copper 
but i give you my word 
i did not go near that blood 
but i guess you ll all feel a little easier
if somebody else was in charge 
norris  i can t see anybody objecting to you 
i m sorry  fellas  but i m not up to it 
  i ll take it 
  like hell you will 
it should be somebody
a little more even tempered  childs 
all right 
i know i m human 
and if you were all these things 
then you d just attack me right now 
so some of you are still human 
this thing doesn t want to show itself 
it wants to hide inside an imitation 
it ll fight if it has to 
but it s vulnerable out in the open 
if it takes us over 
then it has no more enemies 
nobody left to kill it 
and then it s won 
there s a storm hitting us in six hours 
we re gonna find out who s who 
all right  doc  garry and clark 
move over there away from the others 
norris  you and childs
shoot them up with morphine 
tie them down in the rec room
and watch them 
fuchs  you start working
on a new technique 
  i need doc s help 
  you don t wanna drug me 
mac  i m not a prisoner 
let me do it 
you re gonna break the needle in my arm 
no  doc  he s doing a real fine job 
i m gonna hide this tape when i m finished 
if none of us make it 
at least there ll be some kind of record 
storm s been hitting us hard now
for 48 hours 
we still have nothing to go on 
one other thing 
i think it rips through your clothes
when it takes you over 
windows found some shredded long johns 
but the name tag was missing 
they could be anybody s 
nobody   
nobody trusts anybody now 
and we re all very tired 
nobody trusts anybody now 
there s nothing else i can do 
just wait 
r j  macready  helicopter pilot 
u s  outpost  number 31 
you come up with anything yet 
one or two ideas 
but  macready  i ve been thinking 
if a small particle of this thing
is enough to take over an entire organism 
then everyone should prepare
their own meals 
and i suggest we only eat out of cans 
all right 
who s that 
anybody see fuchs 
somebody blew out a fuse in the lab 
lights were out for an hour 
anyone of us could ve gotten to him

every little piece was an individual animal
with a built in desire to protect its own life 
you see  when a man bleeds 
it s just tissue 
the blood from one of you things
won t obey when it s attacked

and we re not with him    burn him 
mac  the door s open

the smart s o b  put it together
piece by piece 
where was he trying to go 
anyplace but here 
hey  you guys  come here  come here

he got back inside and blew the generator 
in six hours 
it ll be a hundred below in here 
well  that s suicide 
not for that thing  it wants to freeze now 
it s got no way out of here 
it just wants to go to sleep in the cold
until the rescue team finds it 
what can we do  what can we do 
whether we make it or not 
we can t let that thing freeze again 
maybe we ll just warm things up
a little around here 
we re not getting out of here alive 
but neither is that thing
