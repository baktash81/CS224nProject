boys i cant catch you
but im going inside to drink
some super juice and then ill be back
hi grethe
lucas
come in and take a seat
how is little marcus doing
its going well
he isnt so little anymore
time flies
but yes he well the plan is
that he will be moving
into my place just before christmas
ive been racking my brain and i
i just cant get it out of my head
one of the children told me some things
that i have to talk to you about
yes of course
i know that this child has
a vivid imagination but
but i still wanted to
mention it to you
yes yes of course
who are we talking about
well i cant tell you that
the child told me that something
happened between the two of you
which should normally
only happen between grownups
what is that what is it
what has happened
the child says that heshe
doesnt like you and
that well
that heshe has seen
your private parts
but how the hell
could that have happened
well i dont know
shit
yes this isnt good
but stay calm
i dont want to jump to any conclusions
well figure this out
what is it
what exactly has been said grethe
well i cant tell you
its fruit time anyway
so i think i need to get going
perhaps it would be best if
you took a couple of days off maybe
then we can sort this out
quietly and calmly
just finish your shift and then
then well figure it out
yes we will
yes
hi grethe
i hope you havent waited long
no no no its fine
im a bit uncertain
about how this is done
yes well
but i just think we should get started
straight away all right
well klara
could you try and tell me
the same thing you told grethe
you need to be a good girl and
and tell him what you told me
about the heart
i didnt say anything
is it just something
grethe is just making up
or is it perhaps something
you were making up
no
all right
then try and tell it to me too
yes its okay for you to tell us
was it something about you saying
that you had seen lucas penis
see if you can tell me what lucas did
see if you can tell me
a bit about that klara
i want to go outside and play
but you just have to answer klara
dont be scared
im sitting right here
im here for you
ole wont do anything to hurt you
he just wants you
to tell us what happened
was it here in the kindergarten
that he showed you his penis
was it klara
klara
youre nodding
so it was here in the kindergarten
will you try and tell me
what else happened
grethe told me that you told her
that it was pointing
was it his penis that was pointing
i think so
i cant remember
so he showed you his penis
klara
do you feel uncomfortable
talking about lucas
but its because
you dont like what he did
klara i think that you
youre doing really well
and youre very good
at answering my questions
and were almost done okay
what did he do afterwards
when he showed you his penis
i dont really know
did you touch it
do you remember
whether
something white came out of it
well this might be a lot all at once
you can go outside and play now
can she do that
oh yes
if you just keep an eye on her
it should be fine
yes
so you and i know
each other well grethe
and thats all well and good
but actually this is
a matter for the police
and of course we need the consent
of her parents first all right
im just grateful for your help
im not sure how to handle
this kind of situation
i also know that klara has
a vivid imagination but
but but i dont think
thats the case here
no
it doesnt seem like it does it
no
ole says that we should prepare to
to make this an official matter
contact the relevant authorities
we should probably cancel
the parents meeting tonight then
no no i dont think so
its our duty to
inform the other parents
where is klara now
i saw her playing outside
where is lucas
i think hes outside too
playing with some of the boys
shouldnt we send him home
yes do that
hello grethe
hello hi torsten
hi grethe
yeah were in a hurry
we were just on our way to
football practice when you called me
i hope you have time
to sit down for a moment
yeah wasnt it at 700
are you all right
yes but were going
to talk about klara
yes that was it
perhaps torsten had better
wait outside while we talk
yes
torsten wake up go outside
and send some texts out there okay
and play some games
ill be right there okay
so
what has she done this time
the little rascal
something may have happened
which isnt supposed to happen
between children and adults
or rather
it most likely has happened
and i havent been able to prevent it
and im deeply sorry for that
klara has recounted some
sexual details about an adult
and i dont think children lie
not in that way
that is
it sounds very strange
what youre telling me grethe
what exactly are you saying
im telling you that it looks
as if klara has been
a victim of sexual abuse
here in the kindergarten
and it looks like a person who is very
close to you has been involved in it
sexual abuse
the things she said
she will probably deny everything now
because she is scared
and embarrassed but well
but i mean where
how
lets wait and see how bad it is
hi heres the cake
hey you old archer
all right good to see you
is it lactosefree
yeah
this looks good
long time no see
hi hi
hi
hi
its good to see you
you too
yes but could i just have
your attention for a moment
because we have an extra item
on the agenda today
unfortunately we have reason
to believe that the children
have been subject to indecent conduct
here in the kindergarten
yes it seems there is
an overwhelming likelihood
that one of the children has
been molested by an adult
and well theoretically there might
be several cases of it
there are lots of symptoms
of these types of violations
which you can keep
an eye out for yourselves
bedwetting headaches
nightmares and such
and we will be talking
a lot more about that tonight
but i would like to ask you
to read this pamphlet
which will tell you
much more about the subject
what grethe that is a very serious
accusation youre making
yes yes but there is
no need to panic not right now
because were following municipality
procedure in this matter to the letter
of course we are
good morning marcus
hello
hello
dad
why are you whispering
they said i couldnt call you
who doesnt want me to call
what why not
what did something happen
marcus are you crying
they are saying all kinds
of things about you
that i cant talk to you or move
wait calm down who is saying that
is your mom saying that
they called and said that you
that all kinds of disgusting things
have happened in the kindergarten
dont listen to them marcus
it isnt true
who called you
grethe from the kindergarten
son listen
just go to school today
and i will call you later tonight okay
and i will talk to your mom too
okay
dont worry about this
its nothing okay son
its because i dont well
i should have told you
im sorry
but yesterday
i was told that one of the children
in the kindergarten
has said that he had
that i had shown my penis
to him or to her
im sorry but
that is really far out
yes
but now marcus mother
has been told too so
by whom
hi lucas
hi

what are you doing here
i thought you were on leave
yeah i just need to
what are you doing here

you shouldnt come here
when ive asked you not to

i i think
its very wrong that the two of us
are standing here together like this
let me
let me tell you whats wrong
youve called marcus mother
he should have been here today
and now he isnt allowed
because you called him
what must he be thinking now
i believe the children
lucas i always have
they dont lie
you just leave marcus alone okay
dont bring my family
into this at all do you understand
you leave my children alone
do you hear
you must be sick
klara is an innocent little girl
is it klara
grethe is it klara

and now everyone in the kindergarten
have started talking about it too

klara
my sweetie
this is a bit difficult
to understand but
maybe its like this that
your head would rather not

to think about but
klara it did happen

that youve told us about it okay
okay honey

lets try the christmas cookies
yes hello nadja
come on in and sit down
yeah so
yes youll have heard
of this very sad case
we have reported it to the police
should i speak english
no its okay
we have informed the parents
about the symptoms of abuse
and they have asked their children
whether they were
having any headaches
or nightmares
nightmares you know
yes and
there were several parents
who felt that they did have that
they had symptoms
and so we chose to act on it
why am i here
are you seeing lucas
is lucas your boyfriend
yeah

his name is elias
sit down marcus okay
give him some water
yeah are you thirsty
no wine though right
yes please
is tap water fine
thanks
marcus i spoke to your mom right
dont forget to call home again
is that understood
do you know
whats going on with dad
what did your old man say
well he said that
that lucas is going into a
preliminary hearing
tomorrow morning at 830
and there can be
what were afraid might happen
that the judge will confirm
the remand order
yeah
and two
that he doesnt see any basis
to continue with the case so
what do you think will happen
i dont know but
apparently all the children are
telling the same story
it seems they describe
in detail your basement
what kind of tapestry
you have on your walls
the color of the sofa and so forth
but when the police went
and searched your house this morning
they discovered
marcus
that we dont even have a basement
exactly
and what does that mean
it means they dont have
a damn basement
but what does it mean for lucas
it means there is still hope
theyve been telling a story
about a basement which doesnt exist
yes its very commonly seen in cases
like this that children
describe details
such as for example your basement
which doesnt exist
and i dont know whether
its their own imagination
something theyre making up on the
playground while talking to each other
whether they hear it from mom and dad
or see something on the television
but i mean people always
work from the presumption
that children are telling the truth
and unfortunately
very often they are
so what now
well now well
just have to wait and see right
theyll call us tomorrow morning
then well see
marcus
marcus
good morning kid
good morning
did you sleep well
i brought you a cheese sandwich
and a cup of coffee
thanks
there was just something i
needed to talk to you about
i just wanted to tell you
that im your godfather
and you can always count on me
no matter whats going to happen okay
i just spoke to your dad
and its looking good
hes on his way here now in a cab
what
he is out again
eat your sandwich and drink your coffee
and then well go down
and say welcome home
to your dad
hello
