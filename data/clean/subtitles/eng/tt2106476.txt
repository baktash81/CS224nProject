he feels sorry for you

okay 
i scared you 
i got you  that was the first time 
  help 
  i have to catch you 
  lucas  lucas 
  hi 
  you can t get away from me 
  could you come in here for a moment 
yes  be right there 
boys  i can t catch you 
but i m going inside to drink
some super juice  and then i ll be back 
hi  grethe 
lucas 
come in and take a seat 
  how is little marcus doing 
  it s going well 
he isn t so little anymore 
time flies 
but yes  he  well  the plan is
that he will be moving
into my place just before christmas 
i ve been racking my brain  and i   
i just can t get it out of my head 
one of the children told me some things
that i have to talk to you about 
yes  of course 
i know that this child has
a vivid imagination  but   
but i still wanted to
mention it to you 
yes  yes  of course 
who are we talking about 
well  i can t tell you that 
the child told me that something
happened between the two of you 
which should normally
only happen between grown ups 
what is that    what is it 
what has happened 
the child says that he she
doesn t like you and   
that    well   
that he she has seen
your private parts 
but how the hell
could that have happened 
well  i don t know 
shit 
yes  this isn t good 
but stay calm 
i don t want to jump to any conclusions 
we ll figure this out 
what is it   
what exactly has been said  grethe 
well  i can t tell you 
it s fruit time anyway 
so i think i need to get going 
perhaps it would be best if
you took a couple of days off  maybe 
then we can sort this out
quietly and calmly 
just finish your shift  and then 
then we ll figure it out 
  yes    we will 
  yes   
hi  grethe 
i hope you haven t waited long 
no  no  no  it s fine 
i m a bit uncertain
about how this is done 
yes  well   
but i just think we should get started
straight away  all right 
well    klara 
could you try and tell me
the same thing you told grethe 
you need to be a good girl and   
and tell him what you told me
about the heart 
i didn t say anything 
is it just something
grethe is just making up 
or is it perhaps something
you were making up 
  no 
  all right 
then try and tell it to me too 
yes  it s okay for you to tell us 
was it something about you saying
that you had seen lucas  penis 
see if you can tell me what lucas did 
see if you can tell me
a bit about that  klara 
i want to go outside and play 
but  you just have to answer  klara 
don t be scared 
i m sitting right here 
i m here for you 
ole won t do anything to hurt you 
he just wants you
to tell us what happened 
was it here in the kindergarten
that he showed you his penis 
was it  klara 
klara 
you re nodding 
so it was here in the kindergarten 
will you try and tell me
what else happened 
grethe told me that you told her
that it was pointing 
was it his penis that was pointing 
i think so 
i can t remember 
so he showed you his penis 
klara 
do you feel uncomfortable
talking about lucas 
but it s because
you don t like what he did 
klara  i think that you   
you re doing really well 
and you re very good
at answering my questions 
and we re almost done  okay 
what did he do afterwards 
when he showed you his penis 
i don t really know 
did you touch it 
do you remember   
whether   
something white came out of it 
well  this might be a lot all at once 
you can go outside and play now 
  can she do that 
  oh yes 
if you just keep an eye on her 
it should be fine 
yes   
so you and i know
each other well  grethe 
and that s all well and good 
but actually this is
a matter for the police 
and  of course  we need the consent
of her parents first  all right 
i m just grateful for your help 
i m not sure how to handle
this kind of situation 
i also know that klara has
a vivid imagination  but   
but  but  i don t think
that s the case here 
no 
it doesn t seem like it  does it 
no 
ole says that we should prepare to   
to make this an official matter 
contact the relevant authorities 
we should probably cancel
the parents  meeting tonight then 
no  no  i don t think so 
it s our duty to
inform the other parents 
where is klara now 
i saw her playing outside 
where is lucas 
i think he s outside too 
playing with some of the boys 
shouldn t we send him home 
yes  do that 
  hello  grethe 
  hello  hi  torsten 
  hi  grethe 
  yeah  we re in a hurry 
we were just on our way to
football practice  when you called me 
i hope you have time
to sit down for a moment 
yeah  wasn t it at 7 00 
are you all right 
yes  but we re going
to talk about klara 
yes  that was it 
perhaps torsten had better
wait outside while we talk 
yes 
torsten  wake up  go outside
and send some texts out there  okay 
and play some games 
i ll be right there  okay 
so   
what has she done this time 
the little rascal 
something may have happened
which isn t supposed to happen
between children and adults   
or rather 
it most likely has happened   
and i haven t been able to prevent it 
and i m deeply sorry for that 
klara has recounted some
sexual details about an adult 
and i don t think children lie 
not in that way 
that is   
it sounds very strange 
what you re telling me  grethe   
what exactly are you saying 
i m telling you that it looks
as if klara has been
a victim of sexual abuse
here in the kindergarten 
and it looks like a person who is very
close to you has been involved in it 
sexual abuse   
the things she said   
she will probably deny everything now
because she is scared
and embarrassed  but  well   
but  i mean  where   
how 
let s wait and see how bad it is 
hi  here s the cake 
hey  you old archer 
all right  good to see you 
  is it lactose free 
  yeah 
this looks good 
long time no see 
hi  hi 
hi 
hi 
  it s good to see you 
  you too 
yes  but could i just have
your attention for a moment 
because we have an extra item
on the agenda today 
unfortunately we have reason
to believe that the children
have been subject to indecent conduct
here in the kindergarten 
yes  it seems there is
an overwhelming likelihood
that one of the children has
been molested by an adult 
and  well  theoretically there might
be several cases of it 
there are lots of symptoms
of these types of violations 
which you can keep
an eye out for yourselves   
bedwetting  headaches 
nightmares and such 
and we will be talking
a lot more about that tonight 
but i would like to ask you
to read this pamphlet 
which will tell you
much more about the subject

have started talking about it too 
they say a lot of things 
klara   
my sweetie 
this is a bit difficult
to understand  but   
maybe it s like this  that   
your head would rather not
remember what happened 
because it s not a very nice thing
to think about  but   
klara  it did happen 
and that s why it s so good
that you ve told us about it  okay 
okay  honey

yes  you ll have heard
of this very sad case 
we have reported it to the police 
should i speak english 
no  it s okay 
we have informed the parents
about the symptoms of abuse 
and they have asked their children
whether they were
having any headaches
or nightmares   
nightmares  you know 
yes  and   
there were several parents
who felt that they did have that 
they had symptoms 
and so we chose to act on it 
why am i here 
are you seeing lucas 
is lucas your boyfriend 
yeah 
i ll try to say it in english 
it is our duty
to inform the authorities
about such matters
in a very serious case like this 
okay  why 
i don t think that anyone here
is any longer in doubt
about what lucas has done 
lucas has been walking
to and from
the kindergarten with klara 
they ve been seen together
all sorts of places 
he has been alone with the kids
right here in the kindergarten 
in the lavatories 
in the pillow room 
kirsten  this is me again

hey  young ladies 
slow down up there 
yeah  we have some family
staying over the weekend so   
hi 
  marcus  come 
  got you 
  you can t catch me 
  my two sisters 
you ve met them  right 
when you were little 
  hi 
  you probably can t remember them 
wow  it has been so long 
how are you 
  fine 
  i call them chip and dale 
they re cracking nuts 
say hi to my dad 
he is just over there
trying to help your dad 
are you okay 
  this is lucas  boy marcus 
  hi 
these are my brothers in law 
sitting here 
  that is elias  and erik 
  hi 
i m erik  and that surly bastard 
his name is elias 
sit down  marcus  okay 
give him some water 
yeah  are you thirsty 
  no wine though  right 
  yes  please 
  is tap water fine 
  thanks 
marcus  i spoke to your mom  right 
don t forget to call home again 
is that understood 
do you know
what s going on with dad 
what did your old man say 
well  he said that   
that lucas is going into a   
preliminary hearing
tomorrow morning  at 8 30 
and there can be
what we re afraid might happen 
that the judge will confirm
the remand order 
  yeah 
  and two   
that he doesn t see any basis
to continue with the case  so   
what do you think will happen 
i don t know  but   
apparently all the children are
telling the same story 
it seems they describe 
in detail  your basement 
what kind of tapestry
you have on your walls 
the color of the sofa and so forth 
but when the police went
and searched your house this morning   
they discovered   
marcus 
that we don t even have a basement 
exactly 
and what does that mean 
it means they don t have
a damn basement 
  but what does it mean for lucas 
  it means there is still hope 
they ve been telling a story
about a basement which doesn t exist 
yes  it s very commonly seen in cases
like this that children
describe details 
such as for example your basement 
which doesn t exist 
and i don t know whether
it s their own imagination 
something they re making up on the
playground while talking to each other 
whether they hear it from mom and dad 
or see something on the television 
but i mean  people always
work from the presumption
that children are telling the truth 
and unfortunately 
very often they are 
  so what now 
  well  now we ll   
just have to wait and see  right 
they ll call us tomorrow morning 
then we ll see 
marcus 
marcus 
good morning  kid 
good morning 
did you sleep well 
i brought you a cheese sandwich
and a cup of coffee 
thanks 
there was just something i   
needed to talk to you about 
i just wanted to tell you
that i m your godfather
and you can always count on me 
no matter what s going to happen  okay 
i just spoke to your dad
and it s looking good 
he s on his way here now in a cab 
what  
he is out again 
eat your sandwich and drink your coffee 
and then we ll go down   
and say welcome home
to your dad
