 be set to face a long war
 against crafty
 and powerful bandits 
 the attack at pearl harbor
 can be repeated
 at any one of many points 
 in both oceans
 and along both our coastlines
 and against
all the rest of the hemisphere 
it will not only be a long war 
 it will be a hard war 
 we expect to eliminate
 the danger from japan 
 but it would serve us ill
 if we accomplished that
 and found that the rest
 of the world was dominated
 by hitler and mussolini 
 we are going to win this war
 and we are going to win
 the peace that follows

to retire me for years 
bring in machines  teletypes 
machines instead
of human beings 
  yes  sir 
  i knew i could count on you 
homer  i just knew it 
you ve already been
a great help to me

telegrapher in the world 
faster than wolinsky 
sending  receiving 
receiving  sending   
and no mistakes  no mistakes 
yeah 
willie grogan 
everybody in the world 
every operator in the world
knew that   
knew that name 
and i    pfft  well   
you and me  homer 
we re still alive 
we are 
mm  ah   
 i should 
 like to say just a word
 to the women in the country
 tonight 
 i have a boy at sea
 on a destroyer 
 for all i know  he may be
 on his way to the pacific 
 two of my children are
in coast cities on the pacific 
 many of you
 all over this country
 have boys in the services
 who will now be called upon
 to go into action 
 you have friends and families
 in what has suddenly become
 a danger zone 
  everything s alright  ma 
i don t want you to sit up
this way  everything s alright 
i had to deliver a telegram   
to a lady over on g street 
it said her son s dead 
she wouldn t believe it 
and when i got back
to the office 
the old telegraph
operator was drunk 
he has to do his work 
or they ll put him on a pension 
  everything s alright  homer 
it s only that you are becoming
aware
of a world
in which you ve been a child 
  i don t know what s happening 
or why 
but no matter what   
i won t let anything hurt you
that way 
   dear homer  you are now
the man of the macauley family 
 so everything i have at home
 is yours 
 my books  my phonograph 
 my microscope 
 i miss you  of course 
 and i think about you
 all the time 
 i think about our father 
 who died so recently
 and yet so long ago 
 his goodness    somehow   
 still with us 
  ah  knock it off 
   his death is not an easy
 thing to understand 
 i guess it just takes time 
 time to let it go 
 and when the pain leaves   
i hope the rest will be lighter
 and better than ever 
 we leave for action soon 
no one knows where that may be 
 i m happy 
 and even though
 i wish there were no war   
 i m happy
 to be serving my country

it ll be a place 
but it won t be people 
i d like to think that i could
go back to ithaca with you 
  you will 
  what do you think about 
  i think about my father 
  matthew macauley 
  yeah  that s right 
  yes 
  uh  he worked in the orchards 
just    plain  ordinary 
everyday work 
never made any more money
than we needed 
ever 
but he did save enough money
to make a down payment
on a piano 
my mother wanted that for bess 
there are still men in the world
like that  toby 
  tell me about bess 
  you wanna know about bess 
you are in luck
