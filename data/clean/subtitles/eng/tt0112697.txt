a way normal life for a teenage girl 
i get up  i brush my teeth 
and i pick out my school clothes 
daddy s a litigator 
those are the scariest kinds of lawyers 
even lucy  our maid  is terrified of him 
and daddy s so good  he gets
 500 an hour to fight with people 
he fights with me for free
because i m his daughter 
 daddy 
 cher  please don t start
 with the juice again 
 daddy  you need your vitamin c 
where s my briefcase 
lt s been a couple of months now 
so l said we d go out to malibu 
don t tell me those brain dead lowlifes
have been calling again 
they are your parents 
and don t try sneaking out of the office 
dr  lovett s coming by
to give you a flu shot 
josh is in town  he s coming for dinner 
 why 
 he s your stepbrother 
you were hardly even married to
his mother and that was five years ago 
 why do l have to see josh 
 you divorce wives  not children 
 here 
 forget it 
did i show you the loqued out jeep
daddy got me 
it s got four wheel drive  dual side
airbags  and a monster sound system 
i don t have a license yet 
but i needed something to learn on 
boy  they came out of nowhere 
here s where dionne lives 
she s my friend because we both know
what it s like
to have people be jealous of us 
dude 
girlfriend 
and i must give her snaps
for her courageous fashion efforts 
hey  cher 
dionne and i were both named
after great singers of the past
who now do infomercials 
so 
go shopping with dr  seuss 
at least l wouldn t skin a collie
to make my backpack 
lt s faux 
 hello  that was a stop sign 
 l totally paused 
yeah  okay 
lt s not even 8 30
and murray is paging me 
 he is so possessive 
 tell me about it 
this weekend he called me
and he s all   where were you  
l m like   l m at my grandmother s    
dionne and her boyfriend murray
are in this dramatic relationship 
i think they ve seen
that ike and tina turner movie
just too many times 
now i have to say to her   
de  why do you put up with it 
you could do so much better 
l know  here he comes 
woman  why don t you be answering
any of my pages 
 l hate when you call me  woman  
 where you been all weekend 
 you jeeping behind my back 
 jeeping 
jeeping  know what l m saying 
no  but speaking of vehicular sex
perhaps you can explain
how this cheap k mart hair extension
 got into the back seat of your car 
 l don t know where that came from 
that looks like one of your little stringy
things you got up in your hair 
l do not wear polyester hair  okay 
unlike some people l know 
like shawana 
 de  l m audi 
 bye 
 why do you gotta go there 
 that s it  l ve had it with you 
ls it that time of the month again 
i don t know why dionne s going out
with a high school boy 
they re like dogs 
you have to clean them
and feed them and   
they re just like
these nervous creatures
that jump and slobber all over you 
get off of me 
as if 
should all oppressed people
be allowed refuge in america 
amber will take the con position 
cher will be pro 
cher  two minutes 
so  okay 
like right now  for example  the haitians
need to come to america 
but some people are all   what about
the strain on our resources  
but it s like  when l had this garden
party for my father s birthday  right 
l said rsvp
because it was a sit down dinner 
but people came that  like  did not
rsvp  so  l was like totally bugging 
l had to haul ass to the kitchen 
redistribute the food 
squish in extra place settings 
but by the end of the day
it was  like  the more the merrier 
and so  if the government could just
get to the kitchen 
rearrange some things  we could
certainly party with the haitians 
and in conclusion 
may l please remind you
that it does not say  rsvp 
on the statue of liberty 
thank you very much 
amber  a reply 
mr  hall  how can l answer that 
the topic is haiti
and she s talking about some little party 
hello  lt was his 50th birthday 
whatever  lf she doesn t
do the assignment  l can t do mine 
ladies 
so  does anyone have
any further thoughts on cher s oration 
elton  comments 
yeah  l can t find my cranberries cd 
l gotta go to the quad
 before somebody snags it 
 l m afraid l can t permit that 
 any further insights 
 l had an insight  mr  hall 
l m all ears 
okay  like  the way l feel
about the rolling stones
is the way my kids are gonna feel
about nine lnch nails 
so l really shouldn t torment my mom
anymore  huh 
yes  well  it s a little off the subject
of haiti
but tolerance is always a good lesson 
 thank you 
 even when it comes out of nowhere 
and with that in mind 
l m going to distribute your report cards 
now  is there a christian stovitz
in this class 
mr  hall  the buzz on christian is
that his parents have joint custody 
so he ll be spending one semester
in chicago and one semester here 
l think it is a travesty
on the part of the legal profession 
thank you for that perspective  cher 
now  could all conversations
please come to a halt 
and could the suicide attempts
please be postponed
till the next period 
suddenly  a dark cloud
settled over first period 
i got a c in debate 
 de 
 what s up 
 did you get your report card 
 yeah  i m toast  how did you do 
l totally choked 
my father is gonna go ballistic on me 
mr  hall was way harsh 
he gave me a c  
he gave me a c 
which drags down my entire average 
 bye 
 l ll call you  okay 
yeah 
isn t my house classic 
the columns date
all the way back to 1972 
wasn t my mom a betty 
she died when i was just a baby 
a fluke accident
during a routine liposuction 
i don t remember her  but i like
to pretend she still watches over me 
ma  98 in geometry  pretty groovy  huh 
yuck 
the maudlin music
of the university station 
what is it about college
and crybaby music 
who s watching the galleria 
so  the flannel shirt deal 
is that a nod
to the crispy seattle weather
or you trying to stay warm
in front of the refrigerator 
oh  my  you re filling out there 
wow  your face is catching up
with your mouth 
 l went by dad s office 
 he is not your dad 
why don t you torture a new family 
just because my mother
married someone else
doesn t mean he s my father 
actually  kato 
that s exactly what it means 
l hope you re not thinking
of staying here 
 l sure want to 
 l m sure you do 
l got a place in westwood near school 
shouldn t you go to school
on the east coast 
l hear girls at nyu
aren t at all particular 
you re funny 
what s your problem  beavis 
   infantry furiously trading
machine gun fire 
you just got here and already
you re playing couch commando 
ln some parts of the universe 
maybe not in contempo casual
but in some parts  it s considered cool
to know what s going on in the world 
thank you  josh  l so need lessons
from you on how to be cool 
tell me that part about kenny g again 
come on  you chuckleheads 
get in here 
josh  are you still growing 
you look taller than you did at easter 
l don t think so 
 doesn t he look bigger 
 his head does 
josh  have you given any thought
to our little discussion
about corporate law 
yeah  but l think l d really like to
check out environmental law 
what for  you want to have
a miserable  frustrating life 
josh will have that
no matter what he does 
at least he knows what he wants to do
and he s in a good college  l d like
to see you have a little bit of direction 
 l have direction 
 yeah  towards the mall 
which reminds me 
where s your report card 
 lt s not ready yet 
 what do you mean  it s not ready yet 
well  some teachers
were trying to lowball me  daddy 
and l know how you say
never accept a first offer 
so l figure these grades are just
a jumping off point to start negotiations 
very good 
whose is that 
de 
hello  yeah  jake  what 
no  not the afternoon 
you are such a brownnoser 
and you are
such a superficial space cadet 
what makes you think you ll get
teachers to change your grades 
only the fact that l ve done it
every other semester 
i told my p e  teacher
an evil male had broken my heart 
so she raised my c to a b 
 miserable 
 they re horrible 
 l can t eat  l can t sleep 
 don t feel bad  l know 
and you see  they re all like that 
then i promised miss geist
i d start a letter writing campaign
to my congressman
about violations of the clean air act 
but mr  hall was totally rigid 
he said my debates
were unresearched
unstructured  and unconvincing 
as if 
i felt impotent and out of control 
which i really hate 
i needed to find sanctuary in a place
where i could gather my thoughts
and regain my strength 
dude  what s wrong 
are you suffering
from buyer s remorse or something 
god  no  nothing like that  lt s just that
we ve been shopping all day and l still
don t know what to do about mr  hall 
l tried everything to convince him
of my scholastic aptitude
but l was brutally rebuffed 
get over it  he s a miserable little man
who wants to make
everyone else miserable  too 
de  that s it 
we ve got to figure out a way
to make mr  hall sublimely happy 
here s the 41 1 on mr  hall 
he s single  he s 47  and he earns
minor ducats at a thankless job 
what that man needs
is a good  healthy boink fest 
unfortunately  there was
a major babe drought in my school 
the evil trolls from the
math department were actually married 
snickers 
and in the grand tradition
of p e  teachers
miss stoeger seemed to
be same sex oriented 
of course 
there was always miss geist 
something told me not to discount
miss geist 
sure  she has runs in her stockings
and her slip is always showing
and she has more lipstick on her teeth
than on her mouth 
popular uprisings from estates
to the general assembly 
god  this woman is screaming
for a makeover 
i m her only hope 
 rough winds do shake
the darling buds of may
 but thy eternal summer shall not fade 
phat  did you write that 
 duh  lt s like a famous quote 
 from where 
cliffs notes 
l know you re going to be
doing better  travis 
no  if you run along 
l ll see you third period 
and we ll try to remember to bring
our textbooks 
okay 
my god  she actually looked happy 
classic 
 paroudasm banafshein 
 here 
sixteen tardies to work off 
janet hong  no tardies 
travis birkenstock  38 tardies 
by far the most tardies in the class 
congratulations 
this is so unexpected 
l didn t even have a speech prepared 
but l would like to say this 
tardiness is not something you can do
all on your own 
many people
contributed to my tardiness 
l d like to thank my parents
for never giving me a ride to school 
the la city bus drivers for taking
a chance on an unknown kid 
and last  but not least 
the wonderful crew at mcdonald s
for spending hours
making those egg mcmuffins
without which l might never be tardy 
lf mr  birkenstock
has no political messages
to include in his speech  l ll go on 
cher horowitz  two tardies 
l object 
do you recall the dates
of these alleged tardies 
one was last monday 
mr  hall 
l was surfing the crimson wave 
l had to haul ass to the ladies  
l assume you re referring to women s
troubles and so l ll let that one slide 
thank you  mr  hall 
miss geist was right about you 
what do you mean 
she said that you were the only one
in the school with any intelligence 
cher  get in here 
yes  daddy 
would you tell me what the hell this is 
a second notice
for three outstanding tickets 
l don t remember getting a first notice 
the ticket is the first notice 
l didn t even know you can get tickets
without a license 
sure you can 
you can get tickets anytime 
ls that so  not around here  you can t 
from this moment on 
you will not drive  sit 
do anything in that jeep
without a supervised driver present 
no cruising around with dionne 
all right 
two permits do not equal a license 
do l make myself clear 
yes  daddy 
l expect you to become a good driver 
l wanna see you apply yourself 
 l will  l m gonna practice real hard 
 okay 
a licensed driver with nothing to do 
where would i find such a loser 
granola breath 
you got something on your chin 
 l m growing a goatee 
 that s good 
you don t wanna be the last one
at the coffee house without chin pubes 
l can t tell you how much l enjoy
these little chats of ours
but in the interest of saving time 
why don t you tell me what you want 
okay 
so  actually
l have a permit and l can drive and all
but daddy says l can t take the jeep out
without a licensed driver 
and since you re not doing
anything and all   
what are the chances of you
shutting up till you get your way 
slim to none  come on 
james bond  in america we drive
on the right side of the road 
l am  you try driving in platforms 
l got to get back to school 
wanna practice parking 
what s the point 
everywhere you go has valet 
what class are you going to 
actually  l m going
to a tree people meeting 
we might get marky mark to plant
a celebrity tree 
how fabulous 
getting marky mark to take time from
his busy pants dropping schedule
to plant trees 
josh  why don t you
just hire a gardener 
well  maybe marky mark wants to use
his popularity for a good cause 
make a contribution 
ln case you ve never heard of that 
a contribution is the giving of   
excuse me  but l have donated
many expensive ltalian outfits to lucy 
   time and funds 
and  as soon as l get my license 
l fully intend to brake for animals 
and l ve contributed many hours helping
two lonely teachers find romance 
which  l ll bet  serves your interests
more than theirs 
lf l ever saw you do anything
that wasn t 90  selfish  l d die of shock 
that d be reason enough for me 
 would you call me selfish 
 no  not to your face 
really 
ls josh giving you shit
 cause he s going through
his post adolescent idealistic phase 
look  there s mr  hall 
mr  hall 
do you drink coffee 
not from this cafeteria 
but  yes  under normal circumstances 
l am such a retard  when l was packing
daddy s lunch this morning
l gave him my lemon snapple
and l took his sucky ltalian roast 
do you want it 
 are you sure you don t want it 
 lt might stunt my growth 
and l wanna be 5 1 0 
like cindy crawford 
l thought maybe you
or miss geist might like it 
maybe you could share it 
 thanks 
 sure 
 miss geist

miss stoeger 
l would just like to say that physical
education in this school is a disgrace 
l mean  standing in line for 40 minutes
is hardly aerobically effective 
l doubt l worked off the calories
in a stick of carefree gum 
well  you certainly exercised
your mouth  cher  now hit the ball 
miss stoeger  that machine is just
a lawsuit waiting to happen 
thanks for the legal advice 
dionne  you re up 
miss stoeger  l have a note
from my tennis instructor
and he would prefer it
if l didn t expose myself to any training
that might derail his teachings 
fine  amber 
miss stoeger  my plastic surgeon
doesn t want me doing
any activity where balls fly at my nose 
well  there goes your social life 
miss stoeger 
got another one 
ladies  we have a new student with us 
this is tai fraiser 
tai  you don t have time to change  but
you can hit a few balls in those clothes 
she could be a farmer in those clothes 
 all right  amber  that s enough 
 de  my mission is clear 
would you look at that girl 
she is so adorably clueless 
 we ve got to adopt her 
 cher  she is tore up 
our stock would plummet 
de  don t you want to use
your popularity for a good cause 
 no 
 come here 
yeah  come here 
 hang with us 
 thank you 
 how do you like california

an herbal refreshment 
we do lunch in 1 0 minutes 
we don t have any tea
 but we have coke and stuff 
 no shit  you guys got coke here 
 yeah 
 yeah  this is america 
so we decided to show tai the ropes
at bronson alcott high school 
that is alana s group over there 
they do the tv station 
they think
that s the most important thing on earth 
and that s the persian mafia 
you can t hang with them
unless you own a bmw 
and there s elton in the white vest 
and all the most popular boys
in the school 
 lncluding my boyfriend  ain t he cute 
 yeah 
lf you make the decision
to date a high school boy
they re the only acceptable ones 
cher  which one of them s
your boyfriend 
as if 
cher s got attitude
about high school boys 
lt s a personal choice every woman
has got to make for herself 
woman  lend me  5 
murray  l ve asked you repeatedly
not to call me  woman  
 excuse me  miss dionne 
 thank you 
street slang is an increasingly
valid form of expression 
most of the feminine pronouns
do have mocking
but not necessarily
misogynistic undertones 
you guys talk like grownups 
well  this is a really good school 
l m gonna go get a soda 
you guys want 
 yeah  sure 
 all right 
she s nice 
project 
that s disgusting 
that s nice representation there 
thanks  those are really nice stickers 
you like them 
l was thinking it was too cluttered 
l wanna wipe all this out
and concentrate
on one main decorative statement 
like marvin the martian right there 
get out of town 
l can do marvin the martian 
really 
l mean 
there s not really a lot to him  but
 you wanna see 
 yeah

 are you talking about drugs 
 yeah 
 tai  how old are you 
 l ll be 1 6 in may 
my birthday s in april 
and as someone older
can l please give you some advice 
lt is one thing to spark up a doobie
and get laced at parties
but it is quite another to be fried all day 
do you see the distinction 
 yeah 
 loadies generally hang
on the grassy knoll over there 
sometimes they come to class
and say bonehead things
and we all laugh  of course
but no respectable girl
actually dates them 
you don t wanna start off
on the wrong foot now  do you 
l ve got an idea 
let s do a makeover 
no 
come on  let us  cher s main thrill
in life is a makeover  okay 
lt gives her a sense of control
in a world full of chaos 
please 
sure  why not 
shit  you guys 
l ve never had straight friends before 
now squeeze your buttocks
when you come up 
 squeeze here 
 cher 
l don t wanna do this anymore 
and my buns 
they don t feel nothing like steel 
okay  it will get easier  l promise 
just as long as we do it every day 
not just sporadically 
how do you know
if you re doing it sporadically 
that s another thing  tai  we ve got to
work on your accent and vocabulary 
see   sporadic  means once in a while 
try and use it in a sentence today 
 all right 
 okay  from now on
we re alternating cindy crawford s
aerobicize and buns of steel
and reading
one non school book a week 
my first book is fit orfat 
mine is  men are from mars 
women are from venus 
good  that takes care of our minds
and bodies 
but we should do something good
for mankind or the planet
for a couple of hours 
hey  brainiac 
the dreaded ex  tai  this is josh 
nice to meet you 
you know about this stuff 
l wanna do something good
for humanity 
how about sterilization 
 what do you think 
 l m amazed 
that l am devoting myself so generously
to someone else 
no 
that you found someone even more
clueless than you are to worship you 
l am rescuing her from teenage hell 
do you know the wounds
of adolescence
could take years to heal 
and you ve never had a mother 
so you re acting out on that poor girl
like she was your barbie doll 
freshman psych rears its ugly head

and make her well dressed and popular

count to 1 00  thank you 
one  two   
the evening had turned into
a royal mess 
sexually harassed  robbed 
i didn t know the number of the party 
so i couldn t call dionne 
and daddy would kill me
if he knew where i was 
there was just one person left to call
and i really  really didn t want
to call him 
come on 
 hello 
 josh  you busy 
 who is it 
 lt s mel s daughter 
so  okay  l was at this party
and my designated driver
tried to attack me 
so l got out so he d stop 
but then he drove off and deserted me 
and then this guy with a gun
held me up  took my money
and my phone and he yelled at me
and he forced me to ruin my dress 
okay  look  where are you 
sun valley 
man  you owe me 
look  the man is ridiculous 
he doesn t have one unique thought
in his little  puny brain 
l think that there s some merit
in learning forms straight off 
josh  please  he s taken our minds
at their most fecund point 
 what 
 and restrained them before they ve
wandered through the garden of ideas 
lt s just like hamlet said 
 to thine own self be true  
no  hamlet didn t say that 
l think
that l remember hamlet accurately 
l remember mel gibson accurately
and he didn t say that 
that polonius guy did 
l m gonna walk heather to her door 
try and stay out of trouble 
my life is turning into a bigger disaster
than malibu 
i didn t know
what i was going to say to tai 
i felt really nervous 
and even fabianne  my masseuse 
said i had a lot of tension in my back 
lt s my hips  isn t it 
 no  of course not 
 yes 
don t be stupid 
you could do so much better 
 he thinks he s all that  tai 
 yeah  god s gift 
you re too good for him 
lf l m too good for him 
then how come l m not with him 
l have got an idea 
let s blow off seventh and eighth
go to the mall  have a calorie fest 
and see the new christian slater 
yes 
you guys 
look at him 
baby 
break me off a piece of that 
 survey says 
 doable 
puny  l like them big 
l hate muscles 
you know what 
l don t really care either way 
just as long as his you know what
isn t crooked  l really hate that 
what 
 don t scare her 
 why  what s wrong 
cher s saving herself for luke perry 
cher  you re a virgin 
god  you say that like it s a bad thing 
besides  the p c  term
is  hymenally challenged  
l am just not interested in doing it
until l find the right person 
you see how picky l am about
my shoes  and they only go on my feet 
yeah 
 god  you re one to talk  de 
 wait a minute here  wait 
l thought that  like 
you and murray were   
my man is satisfied 
he s got no cause for complaints 
but technically  l am a virgin 
you know what l mean 
oh  god 
 what s wrong  tai 
 they re playing our song 
you know  the one that elton and l
danced to 
rolling with the homies
 tai  don t cry 
 l m sorry 
oh  god 
stop 
i could tell tai s grieving period
would be considerable
unless i found someone
to take elton s place right away 
so  okay  i don t want to be a traitor
to my generation and all
but i don t get how guys dress today 
i mean  come on 
it looks like they just fell out of bed
and put on some baggy pants
and take their greasy hair
and cover it up with a backwards cap
and  like  we re expected to swoon 
i don t think so 
searching for a boy in high school is
as useless as searching for meaning
in a pauly shore movie 
so this must be the elusive christian 
 where should l park 
 there s one  third back 
okay  now i know i said i d find
a guy for tai
but i suppose there s no harm
in finding one for myself also 
nice stems 
thanks 
 cher 
 present 
l guess we established that
during attendance 
 lt s time for your oral 
 excuse me 
your original oral 
the topic is violence in the media 
so  okay 
the attorney general says
there s too much violence on tv
and that should stop 
but even if you took out all the violent
shows  you could still see the news 
until mankind is peaceful enough
not to have violence on the news
there s no point in taking it out of shows
that need it for entertainment value 
thank you 
any comments  elton 
my foot hurts  can l go to the nurse 
travis 
two very enthusiastic thumbs up 
fine holiday fun 
hello  was l the only one listening 
l mean  l thought it reeked 
l believe that was your
designer imposter perfume 
l dug it 
during the next few days 
i did what any normal girl would do   
i sent myself love letters
and flowers and candy   
just so he d see how desired i was 
in case he didn t already know 
christian 
and anything you can do
to draw attention to your mouth is good 
also  sometimes
you have to show a little skin 
this reminds guys of being naked 
and then they think of sex 
 hey  duchess 
 yes 
you rationed this weekend 
like saturday 
l m new  but l thought maybe
you had an in on the heavy clambakes 
my ex stepbrother s friends

l wouldn t know 
oh  god  look  there s josh 
l didn t even see him come in  but it s
like he finds the only adult in here 
like he s deliberately trying
to not have fun 
cher  l have a question 
what should l do with this 
should l tie it around
 or put it over my shoulders 
 tie it around your waist 
 ready to slide 
 thanks 
let s go 
the band was kicking
and christian was the hottest guy there 
but my enjoyment was put on pause
when i saw how unhappy tai was 
 hi

when l see a beautiful girl 
l think we were born to move 
what 
look  josh is dancing with tai 
he never dances 
l can see why

any positive changes in her 
yeah 
under your tutelage  she s exploring
the challenging world of bare midriffs 
so you didn t want to make a night of it
with the ring a ding kid 
yeah  daddy wouldn t go too ballistic 
lt s not like he s going to sleep 
no  not if they re going
to finish those depos 
hey  you know what would be so dope 
lf we got some really delicious takeout 
l bet they haven t eaten all night 
yeah  that would be pretty dope of us 
let s do it 
the midnight snack totally revived the
lawyers and daddy was way grateful 
meat 
eat oranges  you get a lot of vitamin c 
daddy  no 
 you know you can t have that 
 cher  come on 
don t be silly 
i know it sounds mental
but sometimes i have more fun
vegging out than when i go partying 
maybe because my party clothes
are so binding 
look  l m just curious 
how many hours a day do you spend
grooming yourself 
some people are not lucky enough
to be as naturally adorable as you are 
stop it  you re making me blush 
hello 
hi  cher  how are you 
hi  gail 
is my son there
cleaning out your refrigerator 
no  he s not here 
you should try the dorms 
all right  bye  hon 
bye bye 
what was that all about 
she wants me to come home
for spring break 
what s the big deal 
nobody will be in school 
yeah  but husband number 4
is at home
and his whole idea
of acting like a family is to criticize me 
so what  you re gonna roam around
campus for two weeks all by yourself 
l don t mind 
that is stupid 
why don t you just come here 
you can have your old room  and
there are gonna be some great parties 
 no 
 why not 
you got your whole social world
going on  l don t want to get in the way 
you won t be in the way 
how much fun would it be
having a brother type tagging along 
josh  you are not my brother 
look  you know what l mean 
come on  you need some excitement
in your life 
lt will replenish you for your finals 
 okay 
 good 
l can t believe l m taking advice
from someone who watches cartoons 
be quiet  you idiot 
that s ren and stimpy 
they are way existential 
do you have any idea
what you re talking about 
no  why  do l sound like l do 
christian said he d call the next day 
but in boy time that meant thursday 
you can imagine my astonishment
to hear from him
while i was packing daddy up 
hello 
he said he d come over with
some videotapes and we d watch them 
a night alone with christian 
i sent for reinforcements 
de 
then de and i
had to design a lighting concept 
and costume decisions 
i don t rely on mirrors
so i always take polaroids 
whenever a boy comes  you should
always have something baking 
oh  l m still all red 
l m trying to make you
as white as l can  cher 
look  you re all flushed 
you have to calm down  okay  calm

to hang out with 
he was becoming one of my favorite
shopping partners

and all of a sudden
we were laughing and they were   
 hey  you okay 
 yeah

 l m fine 
 let s get you home for some r and r 
 what s that 
boy  considering
how clueless she was
tai certainly had
that damsel in distress act down 
meanwhile  back at school 
everyone was talking about
tai s brush with death at the mall 
was it like a montage of all the scenes
in your life 
not exactly a montage 
cher  is it true some gang members
tried to shoot tai in the mall 
no 
well  that s what everyone is saying 
whatever 
when l was 9  l fell off this jungle gym 
that g spot
that they talk about in cosmo   
wait  move down for cher 
hi 
tell me more 
where was l 
you were thinking
about what was really important 
right 
okay  right before you die 
your mind just sort of gets very clear 
lt s a very intense spiritual feeling   
l know when l was held at gunpoint   
 excuse me  you were saying 
 lt s spiritual 
l don t know  l can t pinpoint
the spirituality of it for you
if you ve never experienced
anything quite   
tai  l was planning on going to tower
and getting something for christian 
you know  like some kind of present
or something  you want to come 
sure  l mean  l owe him my life 
so l ll get you after school 
yeah  you know  not today 
l m going over to melrose with amber 
we re going to melrose 
how about tomorrow 
do you think
we could do it next monday 
l mean my week s filling up
pretty fast here 
so when we got back from the lhop
it was 8 00 
oh  swoon  here comes your boyfriend 
hey  tai  check it out 
could you shove down a little bit 
no 
hello  don t the slackers
prefer that grassy knoll over there 
tai 
 well  so anyway   
 what 
have you ever done it in water 
 oh  yeah 
 really 
does the sponge work in water 
what was happening 
dionne asking tai for sex advice 
tai being the most popular girl
in school 
it was like some sort of
alternate universe 
on top of everything else 
i was going to take the driving test 
so i had to find
my most responsible looking ensemble 
where s my white collarless shirt
from fred segal 
 lucy  where s my shirt 
 probably at the cleaner 
but today s the driving test 
lt s my most capable looking outfit 
okay  l call them 
lt s too late now 
we got another notice
from the fire department
saying we have to clear out the bush 
you said you were gonna get
josé to do it 
he s your gardener 
why you don t tell him 
lucy  you know l don t speak mexican 
l not a mexican 
 great  what was that all about 
 lucy s from el salvador 
so 
lt s an entirely different country 
what does that matter 
you get upset if someone thinks
you live below sunset 
okay  so everything is all my fault 
l m always wrong  right 
you re such a brat 
i had an overwhelming sense
of ickiness 
even though i apologized to lucy 
something was still plaguing me 
like josh thinking i was mean
was making me postal 
move into the right lane 
anyway  why should i care
what josh thinks 
why was i letting it
throw me into such turmoil 
 watch out for the bike rider 
 hey 
oops  my bad 
what are you doing 
you can t take up both lanes 
get in the right lane 
not so close 
should l write them a note 
pull over up here
and turn off the engine 
yeah  right there 
are you gonna take me somewhere
to make left hand turns 
we re going back to the dmv 
 lt s over 
 lt s over 
 well  how did l do 
 how d you do 
well  let s see  shall we 
you can t park  you can t switch lanes 
you can t make right hand turns 
you ve damaged private property
and you almost killed someone 
offhand  l d say you failed 
failed 
well  can t we just start over 
l m kind of having a personal problem 
my mind was somewhere else 
you saw how that biker
came out of nowhere  right 
l swear l ll concentrate 
l drive really good usually 
lsn t there somebody else l can talk to 
a supervisor or something 
you can t be the absolute and final word
in drivers  licenses 
girlie  as far as you re concerned 
l am the messiah of the dmv 
now get out of the car 
i can t believe i failed 
i failed something
i couldn t talk my way out of 
all right  put your legs into me 
thank you 
okay 
 hey 
 hey 
 you re home 
 how does it feel to have a license 
l wouldn t know  l failed 
oh  bummer 
and  josh  spare me your lectures
on how driving
is such a big responsibility
you can t b s  your way through it  okay 
l didn t say anything 
l know what you re thinking 
l got to tell you something 
l m really sorry about your test and all 
l m so glad you re here 
there s something l got to do and
l need you here with me while l do it 
 does this thing work 
 yeah  sure 
what is this stuff 
this is a bunch ofjunk
that reminded me of elton 
but l want to burn it
because l am so over him 
 well  what stuff 
 all right 
do you remember
when we were at the val party
and the clog knocked me out
and elton got a towel of ice to cure me 
yeah 
l didn t tell you at the time 
but l took the towel home as a souvenir 
 you re kidding 
 no 
and then  do you remember that song
that was playing when we danced 
remember that 
you know  the rolling with the homies 
anyways  l got the tape  right 
l listened to it like every single night 
don t burn that  okay 
tai  l m really happy for you
but what brought on
this surge of empowerment 
lt s like
l met this guy
who s so totally amazing
that he makes elton look like a loser 
that is so great 
look  you ve got to help me get josh 
get josh what 
you know what l mean 
l like him 
do you think that he likes you 
yeah 
how do you know 
like little things  you know 
he always    he finds some sort of way
to touch me or tickle me 
do you remember the time at the frat
when l was totally depressed
and he asked me to dance with him
and he was really flirty 
you okay 
yeah 
actually  l was really bad today 
l had two mochaccinos 
l feel like ralphing 
l know exactly how that feels 
like  the other day 
l was talking to josh
and we were discussing the difference
between high school girls
and college girls 
college girls wear less makeup
on their face
and that s why guys like them more 
but  tai  do you really think
you d be good with josh 
l mean  he s like a school nerd 
what  am l some sort of
a mentally challenged airhead 
no  not even  l didn t say that 
what  l m not good enough
for josh or something 
l just don t think you d
mesh well together 
you don t think that we mesh well 
why am l even listening
to you to begin with 
you re a virgin who can t drive 
that was way harsh  tai 
all right  look  l m really sorry 
let s just talk when we ve mellowed 
all right  l m audi 
what did i do 
i ve created some sort of a monster 
i could feel the chunks
start to rise up in my throat 
i had to get out 
everything i think
and everything i do is wrong 
i was wrong about elton 
i was wrong about christian   
now josh hated me 
it all boiled down
to one inevitable conclusion 
i was just totally clueless 
oh  and this josh and tai thing
was wigging me more than anything 
i mean  what was my problem 
tai is my pal 
i don t begrudge her a boyfriend 
i really   
i wonder if they have that in my size 
what does she want with josh anyway 
he dresses funny 
he listens to complaint rock
he s not even cute
in a conventional way 
i mean  he s just like this slug
who hangs around the house
all the time 
and he s a hideous dancer 
couldn t take him anywhere 
wait a second 
what am i stressing about 
this is  like  josh 
okay  so he is kind of a baldwin 
but what would he want with tai 
she couldn t make him happy 
josh needs someone with imagination 
someone to take care of him 
someone to laugh at his jokes 
in case he ever makes any 
then suddenly   
oh  my god 
l love josh 
i am majorly  totally 
butt crazy in love with josh 
but now i don t know
how to act around him 
ordinarily  i d strut around him
in my cutest little outfits
and send myself flowers and candy
but i couldn t do that stuff with josh 
 what s with you 
 what do you mean 
you re so quiet 
haven t made me watch
the real world 
l care about the news 
 since when 
 since now 
   retaliation for recent government
successes in central bosnia 
you look confused 
well  l thought they declared peace
in the middle east 
 cher  get in here 
 what s up  daddy 
what are you doing
dancing in front of my office 
nothing  l just wanted to see
if you need any help with anything 
yeah  you could help me
with something 
come over here 
all right 
every time that you see
a telephone conversation
that took place on september 3 
highlight it 
 just september 3 
 okay 
lt s fun 
yeah 
okay 
daddy  did you ever have a problem
that you couldn t argue your way out of 
tell me the problem
and we ll figure out how to argue it 
 l like this boy   
 yes 
   and he likes someone else 
 how could that be 
 l don t know  but l feel wretched 
obviously this boy is a complete moron 
you are the most beautiful girl
in beverly hills 
to tell you the truth  l m not sure
l want you with a stupid fellow like that 
actually he is a smart guy
and  you know 
he s one of those do gooder types
and now l feel like all my after school
commitments are just not good enough 
how can you say that 
who takes care of everyone
in this household 
who makes sure that daddy eats right 
to tell you the truth 
l have not seen such good doing
since your mother 
 really 
 really 
now get back to work 
later  while we were learning
about the pismo beach disaster
i decided i needed
a complete makeover 
except this time i d make over my soul 
but what makes somebody
a better person 
and then i realized all my friends
were really good in different ways 
like christian  he always wants things
to be beautiful and interesting 
or dionne and murray 
when they think no one is watching 
are so considerate of each other 
and poor miss geist
always trying to get us involved 
no matter how much we resist 
oh  this is just   
that doesn t even show  every
single possession  every memory
everything you ve had your whole life 
gone in a second 
can you imagine
what that must feel like 
 elton 
 can l use the pass 
yeah 
we ll be collecting blankets 
disposable diapers 
canned goods 
miss geist 
 cher
