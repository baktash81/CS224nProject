500 an hour to fight with people
he fights with me for free
because im his daughter

airbags and a monster sound system
i dont have a license yet

what its like
to have people be jealous of us

and i must give her snaps
for her courageous fashion efforts
hey cher
dionne and i were both named
after great singers of the past
who now do infomercials
so
go shopping with dr seuss

lm like lm at my grandmothers
dionne and her boyfriend murray

i think theyve seen
that ike and tina turner movie
just too many times
now i have to say to her
de why do you put up with it
you could do so much better
l know here he comes
woman why dont you be answering
any of my pages
l hate when you call me woman
where you been all weekend
you jeeping behind my back
jeeping
jeeping know what lm saying
no but speaking of vehicular sex
perhaps you can explain
how this cheap kmart hair extension
got into the back seat of your car
l dont know where that came from
that looks like one of your little stringy
things you got up in your hair
l do not wear polyester hair okay
unlike some people l know
like shawana
de lm audi
bye
why do you gotta go there
thats it lve had it with you
ls it that time of the month again
i dont know why dionnes going out
with a highschool boy
theyre like dogs
you have to clean them
and feed them and
theyre just like
these nervous creatures
that jump and slobber all over you
get off of me
as if
should all oppressed people
be allowed refuge in america
amber will take the con position
cher will be pro
cher two minutes
so okay
like right now for example the haitians
need to come to america
but some people are all what about
the strain on our resources
but its like when l had this garden
party for my fathers birthday right
l said rsvp
because it was a sitdown dinner
but people came that like did not
rsvp so l was like totally bugging
l had to haul ass to the kitchen
redistribute the food
squish in extra place settings
but by the end of the day
it was like the more the merrier
and so if the government could just
get to the kitchen
rearrange some things we could
certainly party with the haitians
and in conclusion
may l please remind you
that it does not say rsvp
on the statue of liberty
thank you very much
amber a reply
mr hall how can l answer that
the topic is haiti
and shes talking about some little party
hello lt was his 50th birthday
whatever lf she doesnt
do the assignment l cant do mine
ladies
so does anyone have
any further thoughts on chers oration
elton comments
yeah l cant find my cranberries cd
l gotta go to the quad
before somebody snags it
lm afraid l cant permit that
any further insights
l had an insight mr hall
lm all ears
okay like the way l feel
about the rolling stones
is the way my kids are gonna feel
about nine lnch nails
so l really shouldnt torment my mom
anymore huh
yes well its a little off the subject
of haiti
but tolerance is always a good lesson
thank you
even when it comes out of nowhere
and with that in mind
lm going to distribute your report cards
now is there a christian stovitz
in this class
mr hall the buzz on christian is
that his parents have joint custody
so hell be spending one semester
in chicago and one semester here
l think it is a travesty
on the part of the legal profession
thank you for that perspective cher
now could all conversations
please come to a halt
and could the suicide attempts
please be postponed
till the next period
suddenly a dark cloud
settled over first period
i got a c in debate
de
whats up
did you get your report card
yeah im toast how did you do
l totally choked
my father is gonna go ballistic on me
mr hall was way harsh
he gave me a c
he gave me a c
which drags down my entire average
bye
lll call you okay
yeah
isnt my house classic
the columns date
all the way back to 1972
wasnt my mom a betty
she died when i was just a baby
a fluke accident
during a routine liposuction
i dont remember her but i like
to pretend she still watches over me
ma 98 in geometry pretty groovy huh
yuck
the maudlin music
of the university station
what is it about college
and crybaby music
whos watching the galleria
so the flannel shirt deal
is that a nod
to the crispy seattle weather
or you trying to stay warm
in front of the refrigerator
oh my youre filling out there
wow your face is catching up
with your mouth
l went by dads office
he is not your dad
why dont you torture a new family
just because my mother
married someone else
doesnt mean hes my father
actually kato
thats exactly what it means
l hope youre not thinking
of staying here
l sure want to
lm sure you do
l got a place in westwood near school
shouldnt you go to school
on the east coast
l hear girls at nyu
arent at all particular
youre funny
whats your problem beavis
infantry furiously trading
machine gun fire
you just got here and already
youre playing couch commando
ln some parts of the universe
maybe not in contempo casual
but in some parts its considered cool
to know whats going on in the world
thank you josh l so need lessons
from you on how to be cool
tell me that part about kenny g again
come on you chuckleheads
get in here
josh are you still growing
you look taller than you did at easter
l dont think so
doesnt he look bigger
his head does
josh have you given any thought
to our little discussion
about corporate law
yeah but l think ld really like to
check out environmental law
what for you want to have
a miserable frustrating life
josh will have that
no matter what he does
at least he knows what he wants to do
and hes in a good college ld like
to see you have a little bit of direction
l have direction
yeah towards the mall
which reminds me
wheres your report card
lts not ready yet
what do you mean its not ready yet
well some teachers
were trying to lowball me daddy
and l know how you say
never accept a first offer
so l figure these grades are just
a jumping off point to start negotiations
very good
whose is that
de
hello yeah jake what
no not the afternoon
you are such a brownnoser
and you are
such a superficial space cadet
what makes you think youll get
teachers to change your grades
only the fact that lve done it
every other semester
i told my pe teacher
an evil male had broken my heart
so she raised my c to a b
miserable
theyre horrible
l cant eat l cant sleep
dont feel bad l know
and you see theyre all like that
then i promised miss geist
id start a letterwriting campaign
to my congressman
about violations of the clean air act
but mr hall was totally rigid
he said my debates
were unresearched
unstructured and unconvincing
as if
i felt impotent and out of control
which i really hate
i needed to find sanctuary in a place
where i could gather my thoughts
and regain my strength
dude whats wrong
are you suffering
from buyers remorse or something
god no nothing like that lts just that
weve been shopping all day and l still
dont know what to do about mr hall
l tried everything to convince him
of my scholastic aptitude
but l was brutally rebuffed
get over it hes a miserable little man
who wants to make
everyone else miserable too
de thats it
weve got to figure out a way
to make mr hall sublimely happy
heres the 41 1 on mr hall
hes single hes 47 and he earns
minor ducats at a thankless job
what that man needs
is a good healthy boink fest
unfortunately there was
a major babe drought in my school
the evil trolls from the
math department were actually married
snickers
and in the grand tradition
of pe teachers
miss stoeger seemed to
be samesex oriented
of course
there was always miss geist
something told me not to discount
miss geist
sure she has runs in her stockings
and her slip is always showing
and she has more lipstick on her teeth
than on her mouth
popular uprisings from estates
to the general assembly
god this woman is screaming
for a makeover
im her only hope
rough winds do shake
the darling buds of may
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
phat did you write that
duh lts like a famous quote
from where
cliffs notes
l know youre going to be
doing better travis
no if you run along
lll see you third period
and well try to remember to bring
our textbooks
okay
my god she actually looked happy
classic
paroudasm banafshein
here
sixteen tardies to work off
janet hong no tardies
travis birkenstock 38 tardies
by far the most tardies in the class
congratulations
this is so unexpected
l didnt even have a speech prepared
but l would like to say this
tardiness is not something you can do
all on your own
many people
contributed to my tardiness
ld like to thank my parents
for never giving me a ride to school
the la city bus drivers for taking
a chance on an unknown kid
and last but not least
the wonderful crew at mcdonalds
for spending hours
making those egg mcmuffins
without which l might never be tardy
lf mr birkenstock
has no political messages
to include in his speech lll go on
cher horowitz two tardies
l object
do you recall the dates
of these alleged tardies
one was last monday
mr hall
l was surfing the crimson wave
l had to haul ass to the ladies
l assume youre referring to womens
troubles and so lll let that one slide
thank you mr hall
miss geist was right about you
what do you mean
she said that you were the only one
in the school with any intelligence
cher get in here
yes daddy
would you tell me what the hell this is
a second notice
for three outstanding tickets
l dont remember getting a first notice
the ticket is the first notice
l didnt even know you can get tickets
without a license
sure you can
you can get tickets anytime
ls that so not around here you cant
from this moment on
you will not drive sit
do anything in that jeep
without a supervised driver present
no cruising around with dionne
all right
two permits do not equal a license
do l make myself clear
yes daddy
l expect you to become a good driver
l wanna see you apply yourself
l will lm gonna practice real hard
okay
a licensed driver with nothing to do
where would i find such a loser
granola breath
you got something on your chin
lm growing a goatee
thats good
you dont wanna be the last one
at the coffee house without chin pubes
l cant tell you how much l enjoy
these little chats of ours
but in the interest of saving time
why dont you tell me what you want
okay
so actually
l have a permit and l can drive and all
but daddy says l cant take the jeep out
without a licensed driver
and since youre not doing
anything and all
what are the chances of you
shutting up till you get your way
slim to none come on
james bond in america we drive
on the right side of the road
l am you try driving in platforms
l got to get back to school
wanna practice parking
whats the point
everywhere you go has valet
what class are you going to
actually lm going
to a tree people meeting
we might get marky mark to plant
a celebrity tree
how fabulous
getting marky mark to take time from
his busy pantsdropping schedule
to plant trees
josh why dont you
just hire a gardener
well maybe marky mark wants to use
his popularity for a good cause
make a contribution
ln case youve never heard of that
a contribution is the giving of
excuse me but l have donated
many expensive ltalian outfits to lucy
time and funds
and as soon as l get my license
l fully intend to brake for animals
and lve contributed many hours helping
two lonely teachers find romance
which lll bet serves your interests
more than theirs
lf l ever saw you do anything
that wasnt 90 selfish ld die of shock
thatd be reason enough for me
would you call me selfish
no not to your face
really
ls josh giving you shit
cause hes going through
his postadolescent idealistic phase
look theres mr hall
mr hall
do you drink coffee
not from this cafeteria
but yes under normal circumstances
l am such a retard when l was packing
daddys lunch this morning
l gave him my lemon snapple
and l took his sucky ltalian roast
do you want it
are you sure you dont want it
lt might stunt my growth
and l wanna be 51 0
like cindy crawford
l thought maybe you
or miss geist might like it
maybe you could share it
thanks
sure
miss geist

miss stoeger
l would just like to say that physical
education in this school is a disgrace
l mean standing in line for 40 minutes
is hardly aerobically effective
l doubt l worked off the calories
in a stick of carefree gum
well you certainly exercised
your mouth cher now hit the ball
miss stoeger that machine is just
a lawsuit waiting to happen
thanks for the legal advice
dionne youre up
miss stoeger l have a note
from my tennis instructor
and he would prefer it
if l didnt expose myself to any training
that might derail his teachings
fine amber
miss stoeger my plastic surgeon
doesnt want me doing
any activity where balls fly at my nose
well there goes your social life
miss stoeger
got another one
ladies we have a new student with us
this is tai fraiser
tai you dont have time to change but
you can hit a few balls in those clothes
she could be a farmer in those clothes
all right amber thats enough
de my mission is clear
would you look at that girl
she is so adorably clueless
weve got to adopt her
cher she is tore up
our stock would plummet
de dont you want to use
your popularity for a good cause
no
come here
yeah come here

thank you
how do you like california
man lm freaking
l could really use some sort of
an herbal refreshment
we do lunch in 1 0 minutes
we dont have any tea
but we have coke and stuff
no shit you guys got coke here
yeah
yeah this is america
so we decided to show tai the ropes
at bronson alcott high school
that is alanas group over there
they do the tv station
they think
thats the most important thing on earth
and thats the persian mafia
you cant hang with them
unless you own a bmw
and theres elton in the white vest

in the school
lncluding my boyfriend aint he cute
yeah
lf you make the decision
to date a highschool boy

lts a personal choice every woman
has got to make for herself
woman lend me 5
murray lve asked you repeatedly
not to call me woman
excuse me miss dionne
thank you
street slang is an increasingly
valid form of expression
most of the feminine pronouns
do have mocking
but not necessarily
misogynistic undertones
you guys talk like grownups
well this is a really good school
lm gonna go get a soda
you guys want
yeah sure
all right
shes nice
project
thats disgusting
thats nice representation there
thanks those are really nice stickers

theres not really a lot to him but
you wanna see

yeah
tai how old are you
lll be 1 6 in may
my birthdays in april
and as someone older
can l please give you some advice
lt is one thing to spark up a doobie
and get laced at parties
but it is quite another to be fried all day
do you see the distinction
yeah
loadies generally hang
on the grassy knoll over there
sometimes they come to class
and say bonehead things
and we all laugh of course
but no respectable girl
actually dates them
you dont wanna start off
on the wrong foot now do you
lve got an idea
lets do a makeover
no
come on let us chers main thrill
in life is a makeover okay
lt gives her a sense of control
in a world full of chaos

now squeeze your buttocks
when you come up
squeeze here
cher
l dont wanna do this anymore
and my buns
they dont feel nothing like steel
okay it will get easier l promise
just as long as we do it every day
not just sporadically
how do you know
if youre doing it sporadically
thats another thing tai weve got to
work on your accent and vocabulary
see sporadic means once in a while
try and use it in a sentence today
all right
okay from now on
were alternating cindy crawfords
aerobicize and buns of steel
and reading
one nonschool book a week
my first book is fit orfat
mine is men are from mars
women are from venus
good that takes care of our minds
and bodies
but we should do something good
for mankind or the planet
for a couple of hours
hey brainiac
the dreaded ex tai this is josh
nice to meet you
you know about this stuff
l wanna do something good
for humanity
how about sterilization
what do you think
lm amazed
that l am devoting myself so generously
to someone else
no
that you found someone even more
clueless than you are to worship you
l am rescuing her from teenage hell
do you know the wounds
of adolescence
could take years to heal
and youve never had a mother
so youre acting out on that poor girl
like she was your barbie doll
freshman psych rears its ugly head
l am not taking psych
whatever

and make her welldressed and popular

one two
the evening had turned into
a royal mess
sexually harassed robbed
i didnt know the number of the party
so i couldnt call dionne
and daddy would kill me
if he knew where i was
there was just one person left to call
and i really really didnt want
to call him
come on
hello
josh you busy
who is it
lts mels daughter
so okay l was at this party
and my designated driver
tried to attack me
so l got out so hed stop
but then he drove off and deserted me
and then this guy with a gun
held me up took my money
and my phone and he yelled at me
and he forced me to ruin my dress
okay look where are you
sun valley
man you owe me
look the man is ridiculous
he doesnt have one unique thought
in his little puny brain
l think that theres some merit
in learning forms straight off
josh please hes taken our minds
at their most fecund point
what
and restrained them before theyve
wandered through the garden of ideas
lts just like hamlet said
to thine own self be true
no hamlet didnt say that
l think
that l remember hamlet accurately
l remember mel gibson accurately
and he didnt say that
that polonius guy did
lm gonna walk heather to her door
try and stay out of trouble
my life is turning into a bigger disaster
than malibu
i didnt know
what i was going to say to tai
i felt really nervous
and even fabianne my masseuse
said i had a lot of tension in my back
lts my hips isnt it
no of course not
yes
dont be stupid
you could do so much better
he thinks hes all that tai
yeah gods gift
youre too good for him
lf lm too good for him
then how come lm not with him
l have got an idea
lets blow off seventh and eighth
go to the mall have a calorie fest
and see the new christian slater
yes
you guys
look at him
baby
break me off a piece of that
survey says
doable
puny l like them big
l hate muscles
you know what
l dont really care either way
just as long as his youknowwhat
isnt crooked l really hate that
what
dont scare her
why whats wrong
chers saving herself for luke perry
cher youre a virgin
god you say that like its a bad thing
besides the pc term
is hymenally challenged
l am just not interested in doing it
until l find the right person
you see how picky l am about
my shoes and they only go on my feet
yeah
god youre one to talk de
wait a minute here wait
l thought that like
you and murray were
my man is satisfied
hes got no cause for complaints
but technically l am a virgin
you know what l mean
oh god
whats wrong tai
theyre playing our song
you know the one that elton and l
danced to
rolling with the homies
tai dont cry
lm sorry
oh god
stop
i could tell tais grieving period
would be considerable
unless i found someone
to take eltons place right away
so okay i dont want to be a traitor
to my generation and all
but i dont get how guys dress today
i mean come on
it looks like they just fell out of bed
and put on some baggy pants
and take their greasy hair
and cover it up with a backwards cap
and like were expected to swoon
i dont think so
searching for a boy in high school is
as useless as searching for meaning
in a pauly shore movie
so this must be the elusive christian
where should l park
theres one third back
okay now i know i said id find
a guy for tai
but i suppose theres no harm
in finding one for myself also
nice stems
thanks
cher
present
l guess we established that
during attendance
lts time for your oral
excuse me
your original oral
the topic is violence in the media
so okay
the attorney general says
theres too much violence on tv
and that should stop
but even if you took out all the violent
shows you could still see the news
until mankind is peaceful enough
not to have violence on the news
theres no point in taking it out of shows
that need it for entertainment value
thank you
any comments elton
my foot hurts can l go to the nurse
travis
two very enthusiastic thumbs up
fine holiday fun
hello was l the only one listening
l mean l thought it reeked
l believe that was your
designer imposter perfume
l dug it
during the next few days
i did what any normal girl would do
i sent myself love letters
and flowers and candy
just so hed see how desired i was
in case he didnt already know
christian
and anything you can do
to draw attention to your mouth is good
also sometimes
you have to show a little skin
this reminds guys of being naked
and then they think of sex
hey duchess

the band was kicking

but my enjoyment was put on pause
when i saw how unhappy tai was
hi

lawyers and daddy was way grateful
meat

daddy no
you know you cant have that
cher come on
dont be silly
i know it sounds mental
but sometimes i have more fun
vegging out than when i go partying
maybe because my party clothes

some people are not lucky enough
to be as naturally adorable as you are
stop it youre making me blush
hello

all right bye hon
byebye
what was that all about
she wants me to come home
for spring break
whats the big deal
nobody will be in school
yeah but husband number 4

of acting like a family is to criticize me
so what youre gonna roam around
campus for two weeks all by yourself
l dont mind
that is stupid
why dont you just come here
you can have your old room and
there are gonna be some great parties
no
why not

in your life
not exactly a montage
cher is it true some gang members

whatever
when l was 9 l fell off this jungle gym
that gspot

your mind just sort of gets very clear
lts a very intense spiritual feeling
l know when l was held at gunpoint
excuse me you were saying
lts spiritual
l dont know l cant pinpoint
the spirituality of it for you
if youve never experienced
anything quite
tai l was planning on going to tower
and getting something for christian

tai
well so anyway
what
have you ever done it in water
oh yeah
really
does the sponge work in water
what was happening
dionne asking tai for sex advice
tai being the most popular girl
in school
it was like some sort of
alternate universe
on top of everything else
i was going to take the driving test
so i had to find
my most responsiblelooking ensemble
wheres my white collarless shirt
from fred segal
lucy wheres my shirt
probably at the cleaner
but todays the driving test
lts my most capablelooking outfit
okay l call them
lts too late now
we got another notice
from the fire department
saying we have to clear out the bush
you said you were gonna get
josé to do it
hes your gardener
why you dont tell him
lucy you know l dont speak mexican
l not a mexican
great what was that all about
lucys from el salvador
so
lts an entirely different country
what does that matter
you get upset if someone thinks
you live below sunset
okay so everything is all my fault
lm always wrong right
youre such a brat
i had an overwhelming sense
of ickiness
even though i apologized to lucy
something was still plaguing me
like josh thinking i was mean
was making me postal
move into the right lane
anyway why should i care
what josh thinks
why was i letting it
throw me into such turmoil
watch out for the bike rider
hey
oops my bad
what are you doing
you cant take up both lanes
get in the right lane
not so close
should l write them a note
pull over up here
and turn off the engine
yeah right there

to make lefthand turns
were going back to the dmv
lts over
lts over
well how did l do
howd you do
well lets see shall we
you cant park you cant switch lanes
you cant make righthand turns
youve damaged private property
and you almost killed someone
offhand ld say you failed
failed
well cant we just start over
lm kind of having a personal problem
my mind was somewhere else
you saw how that biker
came out of nowhere right
l swear lll concentrate
l drive really good usually
lsnt there somebody else l can talk to
a supervisor or something
you cant be the absolute and final word
in drivers licenses
girlie as far as youre concerned
l am the messiah of the dmv
now get out of the car
i cant believe i failed
i failed something
i couldnt talk my way out of
all right put your legs into me
thank you
okay
hey
hey
youre home
how does it feel to have a license
l wouldnt know l failed
oh bummer
and josh spare me your lectures
on how driving
is such a big responsibility
you cant bs your way through it okay
l didnt say anything
l know what youre thinking
l got to tell you something
lm really sorry about your test and all
lm so glad youre here
theres something l got to do and
l need you here with me while l do it
does this thing work
yeah sure
what is this stuff
this is a bunch ofjunk
that reminded me of elton
but l want to burn it
because l am so over him
well what stuff
all right
do you remember
when we were at the val party
and the clog knocked me out
and elton got a towel of ice to cure me
yeah
l didnt tell you at the time
but l took the towel home as a souvenir
youre kidding
no
and then do you remember that song
that was playing when we danced
remember that
you know the rolling with the homies
anyways l got the tape right
l listened to it like every single night
dont burn that okay
tai lm really happy for you
but what brought on
this surge of empowerment
lts like
l met this guy
whos so totally amazing
that he makes elton look like a loser
that is so great
look youve got to help me get josh
get josh what
you know what l mean
l like him
do you think that he likes you
yeah
how do you know
like little things you know
he always he finds some sort of way
to touch me or tickle me
do you remember the time at the frat
when l was totally depressed
and he asked me to dance with him
and he was really flirty
you okay
yeah
actually l was really bad today
l had two mochaccinos
l feel like ralphing
l know exactly how that feels
like the other day
l was talking to josh
and we were discussing the difference
between highschool girls
and college girls
college girls wear less makeup
on their face
and thats why guys like them more
but tai do you really think
youd be good with josh
l mean hes like a school nerd
what am l some sort of
a mentally challenged airhead
no not even l didnt say that
what lm not good enough
for josh or something
l just dont think youd
mesh well together
you dont think that we mesh well
why am l even listening
to you to begin with
youre a virgin who cant drive
that was way harsh tai
all right look lm really sorry
lets just talk when weve mellowed
all right lm audi
what did i do
ive created some sort of a monster
i could feel the chunks
start to rise up in my throat
i had to get out
everything i think
and everything i do is wrong
i was wrong about elton
i was wrong about christian
now josh hated me
it all boiled down
to one inevitable conclusion
i was just totally clueless
oh and this josh and tai thing
was wigging me more than anything
i mean what was my problem
tai is my pal
i dont begrudge her a boyfriend
i really
i wonder if they have that in my size
what does she want with josh anyway
he dresses funny
he listens to complaint rock
hes not even cute
in a conventional way
i mean hes just like this slug
who hangs around the house
all the time
and hes a hideous dancer
couldnt take him anywhere
wait a second
what am i stressing about
this is like josh
okay so he is kind of a baldwin
but what would he want with tai
she couldnt make him happy
josh needs someone with imagination
someone to take care of him
someone to laugh at his jokes
in case he ever makes any
then suddenly
oh my god
l love josh
i am majorly totally
butt crazy in love with josh
but now i dont know
how to act around him
ordinarily id strut around him
in my cutest little outfits
and send myself flowers and candy
but i couldnt do that stuff with josh
whats with you
what do you mean
youre so quiet
havent made me watch
the real world
l care about the news
since when
since now
retaliation for recent government
successes in central bosnia
you look confused
well l thought they declared peace
in the middle east
cher get in here
whats up daddy
what are you doing
dancing in front of my office
nothing l just wanted to see
if you need any help with anything
yeah you could help me
with something
come over here
all right
every time that you see
a telephone conversation
that took place on september 3
highlight it
just september 3
okay
lts fun
yeah
okay
daddy did you ever have a problem
that you couldnt argue your way out of
tell me the problem
and well figure out how to argue it
l like this boy
yes
and he likes someone else
how could that be
l dont know but l feel wretched
obviously this boy is a complete moron
you are the most beautiful girl
in beverly hills
to tell you the truth lm not sure
l want you with a stupid fellow like that
actually he is a smart guy
and you know
hes one of those dogooder types
and now l feel like all my afterschool
commitments are just not good enough
how can you say that
who takes care of everyone
in this household
who makes sure that daddy eats right
to tell you the truth
l have not seen such good doing
since your mother
really
really
now get back to work
later while we were learning
about the pismo beach disaster
i decided i needed
a complete makeover
except this time id make over my soul
but what makes somebody
a better person
and then i realized all my friends
were really good in different ways
like christian he always wants things
to be beautiful and interesting
or dionne and murray
when they think no one is watching
are so considerate of each other
and poor miss geist
always trying to get us involved
no matter how much we resist
oh this is just
that doesnt even show every
single possession every memory
everything youve had your whole life
gone in a second
can you imagine
what that must feel like
elton
can l use the pass
yeah
well be collecting blankets
disposable diapers
canned goods
