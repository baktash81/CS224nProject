in our underground stronghold
where children of superheroes
are kept safe
while their parents fight enemy forces 
we can t afford to have even one of you
fall into enemy hands 
this way 
do i really have to go in 
because i won t fit in 
i just don t belong 
i mean  i m different from all of them 
besides  my dad doesn t fight anymore 
and after my mom died  he promised that   
yes  well  you know what they say

you should always keep them
or you re a liar who can never be trusted 
are you going to be a problem  missy

missy  i d appreciate it
if you would take a seat right there
and quietly continue your studies
along with the other children

when i tell them
of your exceptional behavior 
well done   chuckles softly 
 whispers  she s gone 
 cheering

   mystical warbling 
 sloshing 
 gasps 
 tires peel out 
 tires screech

on account of the wheelchair 
it s a little on the nose 
but i like it because it s cool 
okay 
you may think i m in the chair
 cause my legs are weak 
but it s the opposite 
my muscles are so strong
my bones can t support  em 
but lucky for me 
my brain s the same way 
it s supercharged 
so i m good 
so  wheels  who s your new friend 
missy  this is noodles 
we call him that because  well 
he stretches and twists around
like a noodle 
yeah  basically 
and that s ojo 
her power is she s a genius drawer 
like van gogh mixed with monet
with just a sprinkle of salvador dali 
can i see that 
a kid standing on top of floating chairs 
an exploding exercise ball 
nothing she draws makes sense 
 missy  that me 
  why d you draw me in front of the class

i don t hear anything 
it s beyond human hearing 
 feedback 
 granada  miss a capella vox 
please refrain from using your high voice 
every dog in the neighborhood
has surrounded our building 
 laughter 
and she can sing so low

 sings very low 
 gasps 
all righty  let s see who s left 
that s blinding fast s kid  slo mo 
 wheels  he s actually moving very fast 
but somehow 
his powers have him stuck in a time warp 
 slowly  hi 
that kid over there 
two packs of candy for crossing our eyes 
 is facemaker 
okay 
beat that 
he makes the craziest faces 
it s impossible 
i can even change my face
to look like you 
 crunching 
he s cheating  i can t compete with that 
oh  dude

that s rewind 
he can rewind time but just a few seconds 
 winding back 
 facemaker screams 
they re twins  it s crazy  right 
what twins  what are you talking about 
fast forward  are you at it again 
you were taking so long  i skipped you
forward a bit  sorry  not sorry 
she and rewind are twins 
opposite powers 
the only thing they agree on
is they don t like each other 
  at all 
  at all 
they re twins  it s crazy  right 
and then 
there s our fearless leader  wild card 
there s not a power
in the world he doesn t have 
true 
sure  he has every power imaginable 
but since he can t focus his energy 
they show up randomly 
also true 
until now that is 
teleport 
 siren wails 
and last  but definitely not least 
guppy 
how are you making that 
my mommy is lavagirl 
but my daddy is sharkboy

you re powerless 
whatever  can we put on the tv 
 sighs  i want to see

 beeps 
you know this is
an epic heroic smackdown event
when they ve called in sharkboy 
   cheering 
  yeah 
 male anchor  earlier today 
sharkboy appeared from the ocean depths 
landing on the beach
of south padre island 
and moments later  lavagirl
blasted up from inside an active volcano 
go sharkboy and lavagirl 
 female anchor 
she s from the earth s core 
and here s mayor doolittle
at today s ribbon cutting
for his new city hall 
rebuilt after the last time
the heroics went into action 
   popping 
   gasping

of course you didn t 
that means
it s none other than blinding fast 
the fastest heroic on the planet 
 slowly  go  dad 
 woman  and here comes crushing low 
 screaming on tv 
and there goes the mayor s new building
in record time 
these battles are insanely expensive
for taxpayers 
but so entertaining 
pass the popcorn 
this battle s gonna be epic 
 female anchor  this is unprecedented 
all of the heroics have been called
into action against the alien threat 
we re getting some live footage now 
and look who s back in action 
it s miracle guy 
you didn t expect him
to actually lose  did you 
 smoldering 
 singing scale 
he s not supposed to be there 
 whirring 
oh my god 
no way 
no one s ever taken down miracle guy 
evasive maneuvers 
 buzzing 
you okay  sharkboy 
 gasps 
 chittering 
 growling 
 groaning 
 straining 
oh no 
i m just getting some terrible news 
it s almost unimaginable 
but two of our heroes
have been captured by the intruders 
i thought the heroics were unbeatable 
they are unbeatable 
it s not over yet 
it looks like our heroes are fighting
amongst themselves again 
 both grunt 
  ladies first 
  i don t need your dated chivalry 
  fine  i ll go 
  how dare you 
 both scream 
  mom 
  dad

 female anchor

   grunts 
 gasps 
   gasps  sighs 
   female anchor  there goes lavagirl

 snarling 
 male anchor

 groans 
 ominous music plays 
 snarling 
 beeping 
dad 
dad  we had a deal 
i know 
i promised i wouldn t be a hero anymore 
but i m still the leader of the heroics 
dad  dad  run  get out of there 
and a good leader 
leads by example 
dad 
i m sorry  honey 
 exhales deeply 
 whimpers 
 female anchor  this is  unbelievable 
  unimaginable 
   male anchor  ladies and gentlemen 
the heroics have fallen 
 sobs gently 
 somber music plays 
we re getting word that the president
would like to address the nation 
people of america 
as you have witnessed 
the heroics have been captured 
military forces are stepping in 
mobilizing to bring our heroes back 
but while it looks rather hopeless 
it s bad  it   
it s hopelessly bad 
how did this guy get to be president 
he can t even put two sentences together 
we have just received a message
from the supreme commander of the aliens
that has been decoded 
it reads   we are from the planet ogima 
unfortunately  we have no choice
but to prepare you for 
takeover 
please comply 
or else earth will be destroyed 
you have three hours  
i m afraid that was the entire message 
there are no heroes left 
god save us all 
children  for your own safety 
we re going into full lockdown 
no one leave your seats 
as long as you stay where you are 
you are all safe 
yeah  right  they can t protect us
from that  we just saw it 
you got a better idea 
we should probably do
what miss granada says 
uh  pardon me  but   
the last look on my dad s face
will haunt me forever 
  what do they want from us 
  do you think our parents are okay 
  uh  excuse me 
  what 
we need to leave this room right now 
why 
because the aliens know where we are 
and they re coming for us next 
 scoffs  how could you possibly know that 
can i borrow this a minute 
ojo drew these 
facemaker standing on top
of the floating chairs 
noodles smashing the exercise ball 
she draws what she sees  big deal 
she drew these things five minutes
before they happened 
ojo s superpower isn t that she can draw 
she can draw the future 
 wild card  okay  cool 
good for ojo  what s your point 
she also drew these alien creatures
breaking into this very room 
there 
 noodle  whoa 
you re saying they ll come through there 
she s right  all these drawings
suddenly make perfect sense 
ojo can see the future 
let me get this straight 
some new girl shows up
with absolutely zero powers 
and suddenly
we re gonna do what she says 
seems like she s got a point 
a moment ago  you agreed
that we weren t safe here 
we re safer in here than running around
outside with you playing captain 
i just want to get out of here 
if anybody wants to join me 
you re free to follow 
fine   sighs 
we re getting out of here 
but only because i say so  you got that 
what s the plan 
granada said this place is on lockdown 
there ll be guards everywhere 
yeah  missy 
what s the plan 
well 
i figure this is kind of like
making an omelet 
you always start by 
breaking some eggs 
hey  is that updog 
what s updog 
not much 
just living my best life over here 
not like i m totally up to no good
or anything 
 mischievous music plays 
so don t ask us how we know this 
but aliens are about to attack 
and we re no longer safe here 
this place is a fortress 
nothing s getting in 
and i m afraid
no one s getting out  either 
those are the rules 
oof  then we re definitely
getting out of here 
and so we re gonna need your access cards 
like  now 
 chuckles 
and you think
we ll just hand these to you 
no  but it would have made this
a whole lot easier 
cushions 
what are these for 
tell him  guppy 
to protect your butts
when you hit the ground 
why don t you get back in line 
 guppy grunts 
 groans 
oh  no 
she s got shark strength 
 groans 
have a nice nap 
 whip cracking 
aliens really are about to attack 
so we ll have to leave your expert care
until you and miss granada know
what we know 
 alarm blares 
 chuckling 
this was a bad idea 
wheels  next time this happens 
don t let the guard reach the alarm 
noodles  you ll take his jacket
and cuff them 
what next time

 gasping 
 screams 
told you your plan wouldn t work 
   groaning

so we will have to leave your expert care
until you and miss granada know
what we know 
   wheels grunts 
   groans

your father never would have become
someone who leads by example 
and you will too 
i m sure of it 
mi amor  i m sure of it 
 wheels  miss moreno 
  what 
  better come quick 
 grandma  oh my 
 missy  oh no 
 helicopter blades whirring 
they sure found you fast 
they wanna take us back
to headquarters 
well  too bad 
  we ve got a world to save 
   grandma  hmm 
 whirring 
go through this tunnel 
i ll hold them off 
go  go  go  go  go 
i wish you could come with us 
hug me  as if it s for the last time 
hey  it won t be 
i promise 
that s my girl 
go  go  go  go  go 
 missy  guys  come on 
 guppy  it sure is dark in here 
ojo  can i use your flashlight 
we just have to stick 
together 
yeah  and find a way
up to the mother ship 
and defeat the aliens
who defeated all the heroics 
 twig snapping 
oh my   chuckles nervously 
visitors 
want some lemonade 
 rumbling 
no 
fine   grunts 
what could we do differently
from our parents 
everything 
like we lure the aliens out of the cities 
so that we don t destroy more buildings 
she s right 
our parents always have huge brawls
in the middle
of the most populated cities 
don t we need superhero costumes 
all superheroes have costumes 
pads  fake muscles 
tons of useless buckles 
underwear on the outside 
masks you can barely see out of 
that s why they were able to pick out
our parents so easily 
because they were easy to spot 
we have to blend in 
be 
stealth 
how 
just trust me 
i have a plan 
  where  what plan 
  i ll show you 
the plan is we re gonna sneak on a bus 
   whispers 
  oh 
holy  doo doo 
i mean  yes  very interesting 
   whispers 
  uh huh 
okay  makes sense  yep 
okay  wow  that s really smart 
okay  everyone  missy and i
figured out a way for us to do this 
check it out 
ojo drew us a clue 
a supply ship 
so what does that mean 
it means there s probably one nearby
that we ll sneak on board
and pilot up to the mother ship 
that s actually a good idea
no matter who thought of it 
  thank you 
   guppy groans 
come on  it s time
we show these aliens what s what 
 wild card  hurry up  slo mo 
 missy  look  there s the supply ship 
just like ojo s drawing 
 kids  ew  gross 
shh  keep it down 
wait 
wait a second 
let s go 
shut the door and let s get out of here 
  wheels  can you   
  no  we re not all here 
what  who s missing 
oh   sighs 
slo mo  cut it out  run 
 snarling 
hurry  they re coming back 
  ten to one says he s tentacled 
  dude 
   rewind  come on  slo mo 
   kids shout encouragement 
 vocalizes  chariots of fire  
 growling  snarling 
all right  hold me down 
slo mo 
yes 
 screaming 
wheels  tell me you figured this out 
it s incredibly intuitive 
whoa 
 screaming 
  please just choose any button 
  it might be one of these 
 screaming 
 engine starts 
but now what 
don t worry 
any minute now  ojo s gonna draw
a picture of all of us smiling
and hugging our parents 
isn t that right  ojo 
oh  that s just great 
hey 
why did you choose me to share
the idea of looking at ojo s ipad 
i don t know 
i guess i know how hard it feels
when everyone expects so much from you 
and you feel like you can t deliver 
do you believe i can 
we all believe you can 
tell that to my parents 
i will 
right after we rescue them 
i m gonna go check it out 
we re all good 
am i just really small 
or is this ship really big 
  it s enormous 
  yeah  how are we gonna find our parents 
i was thinking about that 
mrs  granada found us really easily
back at grandma s house 
and i think i know how 
your bracelet 
i haven t been able to contact my dad 
but maybe the transmitter in here
that connects the two bracelets
works like a tracking device 
but i need a pair of pliers
and a heat source 
my teeth are strong
because my dad s a shark 
  perfect 
  and i ve got a heat source 
heat vision 
now he s a toaster 
close enough 
 bracelet beeping 
is it working 
well  it s leading us somewhere 
 bracelet continues beeping 
hey  that was really good back there 
turning into a toaster
instead of making heat vision 
it was heat related  that s real progress 
i guess it s progress 
you just watch 
pretty soon  you ll be teleporting
like it s nobody s business 
it s about belief 
um  guys 
 rumbling 
does anybody else hear that 
what is that 
it s below us 
i can feel it 
 rattling 
 revving 
 wild card  uh 
 screaming 
 screaming 
 chittering 
 facemaker  which way 
that way 
   snarling 
   screaming 
 vocalizes 
look at that thing 
 door opening 
what the heck
is the president doing here 
so they re inside this thing 
all of them 
   man  that s correct 
  how long before the takeover begins 
according to the supreme commander 
less than an hour 
 president  so soon 
 man  that s what she says 
and she s never wrong 
you don t have to remind me 
ever wonder why we bother with all this
when she already knows
how it s gonna turn out 
all part of the process  i suppose 
what is that thing 
you heard him  it s a rocket
stuffed to the gills with aliens 
in less than an hour  they ll send it
down to earth and start the takeover 
well  then we have to stop them  let s go 
do you children have any idea
what you ve done 
stealing one of our trains 
turning headquarters upside down 
flying an alien shuttle
into outer space  hmm 
 squeals  well done 
looks like
we underestimated your abilities
and your leadership qualities 
you took a huge risk 
but it was the right risk 
headquarters was attacked
just minutes after you escaped 
if you hadn t broken out 
you would have all been captured 
and now you ve managed to lead us
into the heart of this alien mother ship 
 gasps  mm 
so proud 
wait  so we re not in trouble 
of course not 
you are heroes 
  yeah 
   cheering 
yes   chuckles 
 wheels  missy 
her vital signs are all over the place 
save your breath  granada 
they know 
uh oh 
 slithering sound 
hmm 
well  then  round them up 
 kids grunt 
 chittering 
 facemaker  watch it 
 grunts 
quit the pantomime  slo mo 
  you didn t even scrape a knee 
  mm hmm 
 granada  oh  good 
just the kind of divisive attitude
i ve been counting on 
you kids are just like your parents 
the same in fighting 
the same bickering 
putting your own egos ahead of your team 
  take away her water 
   gasps 
 gasps 
they re too powerful together 
oh  don t worry 
i won t take away your little toy 
i already know what your future is 
imprisonment 
life long 
hmm 
 chuckles 
 beeping 
 clunking 
how are we getting out of here 
i 
don t know 
 sighs 
what do you mean you don t know 
i mean 
 sighs  i don t know 
i m thinking  i m thinking 
enough thinking 
i m gonna punch my way out of here 
i have to save my son 
 grunting 
that s not gonna work 
how do you know 
while you were blinking your eyes 
i went around and tried everything 
 mocks 
uh  you were saying 
 snarling 
what are you  an alien spy 
i wouldn t do that if i were you 
i just want to see what it is 
don t worry 
it won t even know i touched it 
 snarls 
 snarls 
 grunts 
 hisses 
 snarls 
 snarls 
a ha 
anita moreno 
hmm 
hi  mom 
no  no  no  don t  hi  mom  me 
   exhales sharply 
  that was pathetic 
you stop training for a year
and look what happens  eh 
you  dropped your guard 
and you 
attacked when you should have blocked 
and you rushed
when you should ve calculated  eh 
i hope your kids
paid more attention to me than you did 
thanks  mom 
i bet miss granada s
been working there for years 
they must have hacked the elections
and put their own alien in as president
so they could set a trap for the heroics 
i m such an idiot 
president neil anami 
spell neil anami backwards and you have 
 i m an alien  
everyone thinks that the aliens
only invaded this morning 
but they ve been here for years 
planning this takeover the whole time 
and now we re locked in this stupid cell
with no way out 
you re welcome 
any luck 
 grunting 
 groans 
i need water 
without water  i can t use my powers 
i need food  my stomach hurts 
  my arm hurts 
  my ears hurt 
we never should have come 
you led us here 
you think i wanted to get locked up
in an alien ship 
it was all of us 
we did it together 
i wanna go home 
 twins in unison  me too 
we all want to go home 
the key is figuring out
how to get out of this room
so we can make sure
there s a home to go back to 
wait a second 
what did you just say 
  he said we all want to go home 
  not that  the second part 
 figure out how to get out of this room
so we can make sure
there s a home to go back to  
stop saying that 
keep it together 
guys 
maybe it s time to admit
we re never getting out of here 
  what 
  i mean  let s get real 
these walls and this door
must be  like  two feet thick 
it s totally impossible 
  wow  great attitude 
   missy  yep 
we re never getting out of here 
and we re certainly never seeing
our parents again  that s for sure 
she s right  pretty soon
we ll forget what they even look like 
the way they smelled 
it ll all just be 
gone 
jeez  you guys are really bumming me out 
but i guess 
this really is the end 
  but i m not ready for the end 
   sniffles 
i was just starting to think 
maybe my sister didn t hate me 
i don t hate you 
 both  i love you 
that love we feel 
is real 
and 
it s that love 
that ll get us out of here 
why are guys saying all this stuff 
it s almost like you want everyone to cry 
oh 
guppy  quick  gather all the tears 
what are you making 
i m making a key 
little miss guppy 
you just saved us 
 lock opens 
 missy  come on  let s go 
 clunking 
 sighs 
how long has it been this bad 
  you should ve come to me 
  you 
  yup 
  hmm 
don t you remember what your generation
was like when we took over 
  good point 
  mm hmm 
well  i guess it s up to the kids 
the next generation is always more 
powerful  more 
evolved 
i got it 
what  you figure a way out of here 
oh  no  i figured out how to switch on
these security monitors 
surprisingly intuitive 
what 
at least now we can watch something
instead of sitting around
yelling at each other 
wait  what s this 
a capella 
  rewind 
  fast forward 
are those our children 
wheels  how much time do we have 
eighteen minutes 
then we need to hurry
if we want to stop the takeover 
us  are you nuts 
we have to go free our parents
and let them handle it 
no  there s no time for that 
by the time we get there  they   
no  i m through listening to you 
when i woke up 
everything was perfect 
then you come along
and everything s a mess 
if little miss no powers
is who you want as a leader 
fine  follow her straight into alienville 
but facemaker and i
are gonna go get our parents 
  we are 
  yes  right now 
guys  we have to stick together 
guys 
what can you do 
  some people are just   
   wheels  forget him 
we need to get to the rocket
so i can stop it before it launches 
how are you so sure you can do that 
because everything the aliens build
is super intuitive to use 
almost like it was designed
for children to operate 
get me close  i ll turn it off 
i don t understand  why did we split up 
where are we going 
  how do you know our parents are this way 
  okay  this is good 
  what do you mean   this is good  
  are you questioning my authority 
uh  i don t even know
what we re talking about 
really  the confused thing 
that s what you re going with 
 granada  just as i suspected 
falling apart at the seams 
hmm 
we need to get that one 
he has so little control over his powers 
he s liable to blow us all up by accident 
let s go 
that s it there 
  we re gonna make it after all  
 tires screech 
uh  no  we re not 
   panting 
   door opens 
uh  guys 
what do we do now 
missy 
why are you so calm 
because we have something
they don t know about  a secret weapon 
  we do 
  yeah 
teamwork 
alone  our powers are special 
but together we re unstoppable

 chuckling 
okay  wild card  spill it 
what s the big plan  hmm 
well  the plan was
to get me close enough to you
to turn you into the dumbest alien
that ever existed 
no way  my powers finally worked 
 laughs 
keep laughing
and i ll blast you right back to ogima 
we have ways of getting
the truth out of you  you know 
that d be a first 
  ha 
   snickering 
we only have six minutes left 
not a problem  not a problem 
all i have to do is
reprogram the rocket s main contr   
what is that 
maybe it s a 
a force field 
no  no  no  we were so close 
but there s no one here but us 
who did this 
 ojo  i did 
ojo  did you just talk 
i could always talk 
i simply chose to observe
and listen instead 
and what i heard was chaos 
dysfunction 
disharmony 
just like your parents 
but that s not true 
we were working together 
were you 
then where s wild card 
that s a good question 
hey  wild card  old buddy 
are you in the ship s control room yet 
 wild card  i sure am 
just like we planned  old buddy 
ignore him 
that s some kind of trick 
i have wild card right here 
don t i 
   squelching 
   gasps 
boo

wow  i gave this plan
50 to 1 odds at best 
but you fell for it
hook  line  and sinker 
we got the one
with the useless superpower 
got you far away
from the control center  didn t it 
go to the control center  now 
go  go  go  go 
 groans loudly 
 chuckles 
 laughs 
you were working together 
surprise 
i even sent him on a secret mission 
isn t that right  wild card 
yep 
and when the team leader tells you
to do something  you hop to it 
since when did you accept missy
as the leader 
since the tunnel 
when she told me you
were an alien spy 
 in unison  ojo s an alien spy 
yep  ojo s a spy 
you knew 
how d you figure it out 
you accidentally gave it away
in one of your own drawings 
your art never lies 
   whispers  she s an alien spy 
  holy  doo doo 
you work for granada  don t you 
or does granada work for you 
they all work for me 
what the 
ojo s an alien 
 all in unison  we know 
 wild card  and now you can be impressed 
 beeps 
 and defeated 
as soon as i figure out which
button removes the shield 
knowing the aliens  it s probably a big
button with a picture of a shield on it

if that s what i want 
i can control my powers now 
working with missy helped me realize
i was so busy
trying to prove everyone else wrong
when i should have been concentrating
on proving myself right 
she believed in me 
now i believe in myself

unfortunately  i was too busy looking
at my own cool kid 
  how s it going  wheels 
   wheels  great

the ignition chamber s motherboard
with one that ll tell the device
it launched even when it didn t 
  that way we fooled it

dude  you actually teleported 
get down there  quick 
  yes 
  yeah 
now swap the motherboards up there 
 alarm blaring 
 gasping 
 whimpering 
what s happening 
the takeover is happening 
 heroic music playing 
wait  so our parents were
in the pyramid all along 
 sighs  but i don t understand 
what s the takeover 
the takeover of power 
from your parents 
you see  the next generation is always
an improvement from the last 
things are not heading
in the right direction on your planet 
and you children
are inheriting earth s problems 
and need to be able to fix them 
sooner rather than later 
 president  it s in the best interest
of the entire galaxy that life
on earth survives and thrives 
so  we infiltrated both your government
and heroics headquarters
so we could train you
and accelerate the transfer of power 
 ojo  as you ve seen from today s events 
it s not enough to be strong 
powerful 
or even magic 
if you do not use your strengths together
and with good judgment 
 coughs pointedly 
 you are doomed 
but i don t understand 
the clock hit zero 
we were one second too late 
the supreme commander knew
down to the second
exactly when the takeover would happen 
 ojo  your guess was close  wheels 
but not quite right 
everything on the ship
wasn t designed for children 
oh  it was designed by children 
  that s correct 
   granada chuckles 
on our planet 
the children are in charge 
so  you re their leader 
yes 
just as i knew
you would be a natural leader 
it s why i drew you
at the front of the class 
so  from one leader to another 
as we each head off
to face the challenges of the universe 
can we count on you
to not just help save your planet 
but the entire galaxy 
you have our word 
when you need us 
we ll be there 
thank you 
 whirring 
 inaudible 
i love you  oh   chuckles

   missy chuckles  i missed you 
   grandma chuckles 
 granada squeals 
 missy  this was the day our heroes fell 
but others did rise 
as for the aliens  they ll be back 
and when they call on us for help 
we will be prepared 
we will be ready
