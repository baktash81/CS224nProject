in a secret place
hidden deep in a forest 
whoa  whoa 
that is a smurf 
we call him clumsy 
and this is our village 
where there s a smurf
for just about everything 
like jokey 
hey  here s a present for you 
ah 
oh  gullible smurf 
you re so gullible 
actually  i meant
to give you this one 
wow  thanks 
  96  97  98  99  100 
  here s hefty 
and over here is   
now  for the
one fingered pushup 
one  two  three   
meet nerdy smurf 
excuse me 
sorry  brainy  just kidding 
nosey 
hmm  well  what s
going on over there 
paranoid smurf 
winner 
hmm 
loser 
karate smurf 
hyah 
handy  vanity 
farmer  painter  baker 
magician  scuba 
policeman  therapist 
sometimes i just feel blue 
there s even
table eating smurf 
oh  hi 
yeah  we re not too
sure about him  either 
and then there s me  papa smurf 
i sort of run this place 
but this isn t a story about me 
whoa   
or clumsy 
or any of them 
it s about the only girl
in our village 
smurfette 
hi  laundry smurf 
howdy do  smurfette 
hey  guys 
but that s not the only thing
that s different
about smurfette 
she was created
by the evil wizard  gargamel 
using dark magic   
he made her from a lump of clay 
now  go and find smurf village 
luckily  i knew
a little magic of my own 
but there was still one problem 
smurfette s name doesn t
tell us anything about her 
okay  the physics are   
it doesn t tell us who she is 
hyah 
high heels 
or what she does 
so  what exactly is a smurfette 
well  let me be frank 
she s a rubbish baker 
let s see  smurfette 
smurfette  smurfette  smurfette 
huh  it s not here 
well  smurfette is a combination
of a smurf and an ette 
but what s an ette 
oh  uh  yeah 
smurfette  well  she s   
she s the greatest 
the most wondrous
creature on earth 
yes  you are 
smurfette   
um   
oh  i got it 
this is one of
those eternal questions
that we ll never 
ever know the answer to 
huh  wait  she is 
do you think she heard me 
so  what is a smurfette 
no one wanted that answer
more than smurfette herself 
what are you doing 
oh 
hey  grouchy  i was just   
leaving 
um   
this is my bench 
i come here same time
every day  and i   
ooh  let me guess 
 and grouch  
exactly 
i can do that 
i can grouch 
hi  grouchy  hi  smurfette 
nice day  huh 
no  it s not 
it s gonna rain 
which actually helps
the plants grow 
but also means it s gonna be
cloudy  so  chew on that 
then again  there
might be a rainbow 
but rainbows are dumb 
just kidding 
i love rainbows 
ugh 
you re not very good
at this  are ya 
uh  no  i m not 
in fact  you re actually
kind of bad at it 
yup 
but you re also bad at it 
that s a lie 
you re really 
really good at it 
hi  brainy 
ah  smurfette 
thank goodness you re here 
i was    whoa 
whoa  we re running trials
on my new invention 
the smurfy thing finder 
test subject  hefty smurf 
oh  hey  smurfette 
i mean  uh   
hey  smurfette 
oh  hey 
that thing s safe  right 
  is it safe 
  of course 
i d get back here if i were you 
snappy bug 
take this down  smurfy
thing finder trial 1 03 
ready  hefty 
roger that 
whoa 
it works 
wow  this thing
really gets me 
it s able to hone in on
hefty s dominant trait 
super strength 
which i distill into this 
i call it brainy s
super smurfy power fuel 
here  you can try it first 
all clear 
yeah  you see  when you say
things like  all clear  
it makes me not want to   
whoa 
hey  guys 
hi  clumsy 
you re just in time
to witness scientific history 
oh  what s going on
in here 
none of your business  nosey 
hmm  well  all right 
hey  if that vegetable hat can
tell us that hefty is strong 
maybe it can tell me
what an ette is 
power it up  brainy 
whoa 
fascinating 
what happened 
somehow  instead of sending
energy out  you absorbed it 
probably something
to do with the fact
that you re not a real   
a real smurf  go
ahead  you can say it 
no  no  i just meant that
this machine wasn t built for a
smurf of your  well  origins 
yeah  it s okay  i get it 
brainy 
hey  you know what  let s
all go have some fun 
yeah 
  pizza

a pinch of newt poo 
a gram of calcified fungus from
between the toes of a yak 
and a piece of cheese i left

petrification modules 
or  as i like to
call  em  freeze balls

ingredient in the world 
next slide

100 of them combined

with no sign of them anywhere 
not now  azrael  i m in
the middle of a lecture

smurfs  drain them of their magic
and  finally 
use that magic to become
the most powerful
wizard in the world

three tall trees 
in the forbidden forest 
we ve never
searched there before 
i m a genius 
psst 
azrael  it s time
to take a road trip 
shh 
prepare my trail mix 
oh  smurfette  congratulations 
you ve just led me
to an undiscovered
population of smurfs 
they have no idea we even exist

the forbidden forest 
one at a time 
one at a time 
please  please 
smurfette sees
this mystery smurf 
we have to go to
the forbidden forest 
i ve told you time and again 
the forbidden forest
is forbidden 
and now you re
talking about maps
and mystery smurfs
and gargamel s lair 
none of this makes any sense 
and i really don t understand
why you can t follow
simple rules 
you snuck out and it
put you all in danger 
seems to me the only way
i can keep you safe is if   
you re grounded 
grounded  no  not grounded 
what  no way 
but  papa  but   
come on 
no  buts  
none of you are to take one
step out of your mushrooms

did you get pecked
on the noggin  smurfette 
actually  smurfette   
don t worry  papa 
we are certainly going to do
some thinking about what we did 
and so forth 
but we will definitely
not be leaving our rooms
until we ve thought
this whole thing out 
and then  just for good measure 
we ll think about it some more 
yes  but   
great talk  papa

i might have been
a bit tough on you and the boys 
and i know there are times
i m a little overprotective 
okay  a lot overprotective 
but you have to understand 
you snuck out 
you have to be more careful 
smurfette  i know
lately you may not realize 
and i may not say it enough 
but you are   
you shine 
so  anyway  we re smurfy

you know what i m trying to say 
it hasn t been that much fun 
well done  hefty

the wood should be stacked
into a tepee like structure 
step two  i tap this
flint with a rock and   
you re not even blowing on it 
you re spitting on it 
hmm  that s odd 
perhaps the wood you
collected was damp  hefty 
according to my manual 
it should spark right up 
hey  i ve got an idea

i m the smart smurf 
but i can t start a fire 
okay  the damage is minimal 
the binding s still intact 
it smells good 
just think  guys 
after all this time 
while we ve been going about
our smurfy business back home 
there s been other smurfs
out there  just like us 
or they could be
nothing like us 
he s right  we should be
prepared for whatever we find 
those other smurfs
might not even be blue 
maybe they ll be orange 
ah  i like orange 
what if they all wear glasses 
or have big  bushy mustaches 
what if they have scaly
skin and sharp teeth 
and giant claws 
and big  beady eyes 
what if they have hands 
good one  bro 
listen  it doesn t matter
what they look like 
we still have to warn them 
gargamel s wrong about me 
it s not my purpose to help him 
i m meant to save those smurfs 
and we re gonna help you

you never cease to amaze me 
so  as for that
burning question   
what s a smurfette 
well  i don t need a book
to tell you she s   
right 
smurfette can t be defined
by just one word 
she s many things 
oh  she doesn t know it yet 
but she s my new best friend 
smurfette is a bunny wrangler 
she s tough 
not as tough as me 
but tough enough 
smurfette can be anything
she wants to be 
what s going on in there 
goodbye 
say   blue cheese  
blue cheese 
i was this close
to getting rid of the smurfs 
and you ruined everything 
i knew i should have gotten
a dog from the shelter 
i m not saying this
to be cruel  okay 
i m saying it to
be constructive 
you re a useless feline 
that s just mean  that s mean 
there was a line 
and you crossed it 
i was just jib jabbing 
and you crossed that line 
and that stung 
i demand an apology 
you were going to learn this
one way or another 
but i am not your real father 
but that doesn t matter now 
what matters is
destroying the smurfs 
any thoughts 
i mean  i have thoughts 
but i always like to spitball
off of your thoughts 
azrael  i m not
going to sugarcoat this 
your ideas are terrible 
i can t think with this music 
can someone please
shut off the music 
and what s with all these words
scrolling in front of me 
did the smurfs do this
so that i would be distracted
and not be able to
destroy them as easily 
 matte painters   i don t
even know what that means 
someone just
made that up  right 
i feel sorry for
whoever  matte  is 
 look development artists  
oh  yes  of course 
let s develop some looks 
like maybe a really angry look
