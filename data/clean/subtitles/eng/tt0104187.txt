why do we call it the ice age
cause there was a lot of ice
what do we call
these big chunks of ice
those big slabs of ice
we called what
what do we call them
glaciers
right you are paying
attention thats good
these glaciers as they
moved down our way
theyre so heavy cold
and thick that they
freeze the ground water
and they form underground
glaciers
right believe it or not some scientists
believe that there are actual
underground glacial movements
still in this part of the world
you know what i think
that is class
lame
exactly bunco bogus
listen
please remember
that most of this hemisphere
including the ground
im walking on
all of this was under ice
at some point so i guess
finding something frozen
dug up here or there
wouldnt be that uncommon
