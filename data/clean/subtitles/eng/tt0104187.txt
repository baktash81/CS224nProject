these big chunks of ice 
those big slabs of ice  
we called what  
what do we call them  
glaciers 
right  you are paying
attention  that s good 
these glaciers  as they
moved down our way 
they re so heavy  cold
and thick that they
freeze the ground water   
  and they form underground     
  glaciers 
right  believe it or not  some scientists
believe that there are actual   
underground glacial movements
still in this part of the world 
you know what i think
that is  class  
lame  
exactly  bunco  bogus 
listen 
please remember   
that most of this hemisphere 
including the ground
i m walking on 
all of this was under ice
at some point  so i guess   
finding something frozen 
dug up here or there 
wouldn t be that uncommon
