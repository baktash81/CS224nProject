  of course you do 
can i be a ballplayer 
you can be anything
you want to be 
the saddest thing in life
is wasted talent

go fuck yourself 
you re very emotional 
white birch wins it
in an absolute shocker 
we finally got our own
social club 
we called it the deuces wild 
drinks were a buck
and the jukebox paid the rent 
we only cared
about hanging out 
we would cut class
and hang out all day and night 
nobody wanted to go home   
because you might leave and find
out later you missed something 
whoa  look at those broads
over there  they re beautiful

  they d fail my test fast 
  what test 
if you want to marry a girl 
she s got to pass the test 
  i call it the mario test 
  this i got to hear 
the test is  you take a girl
for a ride in your car 
you pull up to one of them big
18 wheelers on the highway 
you pull alongside it
and get the driver s attention 
honk your horn  make sure
he s looking  that s important 
at the same time  put your hand
behind this broad s head   
and push her head down
between your legs 
  get the fuck out of here 
  it s for her own good 
now  if this girl
goes down on you   
knowing that truck driver
is watching   
then she s a pig
who can t be trusted

when they re into it  they
throw their hair over their ear 
they did it before  believe me
