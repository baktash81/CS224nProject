 singing  i m a weirdo 
 singing  i wanna have control 
i want a perfect body   
hey  uh uh 
i told you a million times  you keep your
grimy raccoon hands off my zune 
and i told you a million times 
i m not a damn raccoon 
again 
i love you  gamora 
so what are you
gonna do about quill 
me  why not you 
i got emotionalistical issues 
what am i gonna do 
why are you on the ceiling 
i wanted to see if these new
gravity boots worked on a slope 
here we go 
sorry 
bozhe moi  kraglin 
you must know you will never learn 
you think you could do better 
da 
davai 
telekinesis is cheating 
that s a stupid little pebble 
i can do that with my dang finger 
you re a bad dog 
do not say that to me 
you are  you re a bad dog 
take that back  come on 
that s not cool 
nebula  did you hear 
he called me a bad dog and
he refuse to take it back 
i don t care  cosmo 
is peter okay 
  i don t know 
  what are you going to do 
me  he s your brother 
it doesn t matter  he still
doesn t listen to me 
yeah  he has been pretty mopey
ever since gamora died 
she s not dead 
she just doesn t remember
anything from the past few years 
nobody tells me nothing 
mantis  why don t you just touch him
and  you know  make him happy 
i am groot 
gross 
no  not like that 
touch him with her powers 
it is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends 
what about that time you made
me fall in love with my sock 
well  that was funny 
i guess it s back to one of us
touching him the other way 
maybe we should draw straws 
no one ever meant that  drax 
  crazy on you   heart  
what was that  
what the hell  
where did you go  squirrel 
on the ground 
who is that maniac 
some super douche with ray gun hands 
i don t freakin  know 
who threw this thing at me 
shut up 
baby 
pick on someone your own size 
peter 
peter 
we need med packs 
nebula 
piss off 
that hurts 
what a pity 
no 
all i did was activate the med packs 
get them off  now 
ah  hell 
  we need to get him to the med bay 
  it s destroyed 
there s one on the ship 
stitch him up and transfer
him in with the rest of batch 89 
it s okay 
you re here with us now 
hey  who s the new guy 
what kind of thing are you 
you ve got like  a
mask on your face 
mask  eyes  face  mouth 
does it words 
it s okay  friend 
don t let them scare you 
hurts 
it s okay 
you re gonna be okay 
a kill switch 
a device 
set to destruct if anyone goes
poking around inside him 
or even if we use the med packs 
why would rocket
have a kill switch 
apparently someone considers him proprietary
technology and sent that golden lunatic to get him 
so he ll die if we operate on him 
  and he ll die if we don t 
  there has to be some way to bypass it 
it looks like there s a pass key
that could override the kill switch 
what do we know about
where rocket came from 
he won t talk about it 
much of the tech was developed
by a company called orgocorp 
and there s a code on all of it 
89p13 
he s got maybe 48 hours 
  where are you going 
  orgocorp have to have records  right 
maybe they ll have a way for us to
override the kill switch and save rocket 
they won t just give us that information 
well  that s why we re gonna break in 
and kill anyone who gets in our way 
  not kill anyone 
  kill a few people 
  kill no people 
  kill one guy  one stupid guy who no one loves 
now you re just making it sad 
kraglin  cosmo  i need you to keep watch over
knowhere till we re back  couple of days tops 
  aye  cap n 
  aye  comrade 
  take back what you said that i m a bad dog 
  nope 
i know you don t really
think i am a bad dog 
  can you please take it back 
  i will not 
a
i located the coordinates for orgocorp 
i think i have a contact near there 
maybe they can help us get in 
contact him 
let s go save our friend 
  since you been gone   rainbow  
it s good to have friends 
my poor baby 
unnh  it hurts 
  do you have it 
  he does not  sire 
i tried to warn you 
high evolutionary 
these guardians are more
powerful than you think 
or perhaps you simply overestimate
your own value  high priestess 
no doubt  a flaw of some
type in my own design 
i created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment 
beautiful numbskulls 
but your egos have
run wild  say  ah  
and this one was
meant to be the warlock 
the apogee of their people 
you removed adam from
his cocoon early  my liege 
he is still a child 
no  there s something wrong
with him even outside all that 
yes  there s something wrong with me 
i was stabbed  you extraordinary phallus   
he doesn t know any better  we
shall do whatever you require  my liege 
you knew of 89p13 s existence
for years without alerting me 
that s not what i require 
i m sorry  my liege 
find 89p13 and return it to me 
or  i will destroy your entire civilization
as is my right as your maker 
do you understand 
do you understand 
yes sire 
toodle loo 
how did 89p13 survive
after all these years  theel 
it was always clever  sire 
yes  that s exactly why i want it now 
  of course 
  its brain 
that is the only reason  sire 
but are you really trusting
the sovereign to retrieve it 
they re merely a backup 
i believe i know where they re going 
it s bioformed 
instead of being built  it s
grown from living matter 
the structure is surrounded by three
impenetrable plasmic security shields 
it s not gonna be easy to
break into this place  star lord 
it doesn t have to be easy  i was
a professional thief  remember 
i ll jam the signals one at a time 
she calls me star lord
when she s mad at me 
she s always mad at everyone 
it s because i was drunk 
she s right  if i hadn t been drinking   
maybe rocket    i m sorry 
it s okay  he s your best friend 
second best friend 
everyone around me dies 
my mother  yondu   
  gamora   
  gamora isn t dead 
she is to us 
do you want a zargnut 
thank you 
first shield  set 
three  two  one 
  peter 
  what 
you had family on earth  and you
never wanted to go back to see them 
you re my sister  that s all
the family i want or need 
besides  it s really just my grandpa 
okay  he s a pretty hard guy 
  still  don t you think he   
  what 
you were abducted by ravagers
the same day he lost his daughter 
oh yeah  he was upset  my mom died  he screamed
in my face  he pushed me out of the room 
he was probably just trying to protect you 
  what are you talking about 
  what 
i m talking about the people in my life who died 
you re talking about this 
second shield  set 
three  two  one 
i m only saying you ve never
even gone to see if he s okay 
he could still be alive 
my grandpa  he d be like  90 
something years old 
so he could still be alive 
people on earth die
when they re like 50 
they die when they re 50 
i don t know  something like that 
what s even the
point of being born 
exactly 
are you about to die 
i m not 50 
the point is  i wasn t talking
about any of this 
third shield  set 
three  two  one 
well  not everything is about
what you are talking about 
and i m only saying you are upset because so
many of the people you cared about have left you 
but you also left someone 
and maybe i wanted a zargnut 
it s too late  they re all gone 
why didn t we go through 
we did  it s not the shield 
oh  hell 
ravagers 
hey guys  you re about to be
boarded by the united ravagers 
you can surrender and turn over any stuff
worth anything and live  or you can die 
it s up to you 
drax  no  no  no  drax 
guys  it s me  peter quill 
i m one of you  remember 
hold on 
  we have an appointment 
  we have an appointment 
  with who 
  with gamora 
with gamora 
what 
you re early 
   grunt 
   grunt 
what are these 
orgocorp uniforms 
you have to wear these to move through
the orgo without attracting attention 
this isn t my color 
what did you say 
it clashes with my eyes 
put it on 
nebula  why would you not tell me that
you ve been in contact with gamora 
because i didn t want
you to get freaked out 
  freaked out how  
  like that 
let me in there  i don t want to be trapped
out here 
gamora  we re grateful for your help 
i m not doing this out of
the kindness of my heart 
i m doing this for the hundred
thousand units my sister promised 
so you re a ravager now 
put on the uniform 
never pictured you as the ravager type 
who are you again 
oh  man   
orgocorp is in possession of some of the
most advanced cybergenetic ip in the galaxy 
so they re heavily guarded
by the deadly orgosentries 
now i know you don t have
documentation to dock 
so you re gonna have to
get in there on your own 
once in  gamora is gonna
lead you to the records 
where maybe you can find the
pass key to override the kill switch 
and help you save the hedgehog 
but if you get into trouble 
we will not be able
to bail you out 
yes 
yes  of course 
its functioning has skyrocketed 
that s correct  p13  very good 
that s the new world 
counter earth 
where the experiments will
go once they re ready 
  it blue 
  that s the sky 
sky 
  rocket 
  yes  it is 
what sounds 
that s music 
  we like it 
  we do 
this recording is over 5 000 years old 
 speaks foreign language 
which translated  is   
be not as you are 
but as you should be 
it s our sacred mission
to take the cacophony
of sounds around us
and turn it into a song 
to take an imperfect clump of
biological matter such as you 
and transform it into something   
perfect 
and we re halfway there  aren t we 
come with me  p13 
i d like to show you something 
we have but a single quest   
to create the perfect species 
and the perfect society 
you  p13 
are part of batch 89 
but here  with batch 90 
i ve developed a process
by which i can guide
any organism through millions of years of
programmed evolutionary changes  in a moment 
see now   
there s the rub 
for some reason  these specimens
are also over producing the legobeta
microsamino protein in their systems 
causing them to be  well   
violent  we don t like it 
a utopia can t have its denizens
murdering one another  can it 
they can ts 
  can t 
  can t 
theel 
they re programmed to be peaceful  like you 
but for some reason  it s not catching 
heptonic filters 
what 
they suppresaliding the glycusolided
saltses 
and then  boop  boop  boop   
absisting residual deformant 
and then  they  make  um   
  what do you say 
  the legobeta microsamino proteins 
yeah  thems 
and then  angry turtleses 
huh 
  in the meantime   spacehog  
there  that s the decompression chamber 
lock in 
go 
activate gravity boots and gloves 
nebula  go 
so you really don t remember anything 
like what 
  about your time with us 
  no 
  well  we were   
  we weren t anything 
  you and me   
  that person was some alternate future version of me 
wasn t me 
we loved each other 
i don t think so 
i know you don t remember any of it   
but you were everything to me 
and i miss you 
so much 
and maybe   
maybe if you open yourself up to it   
  there s a possibility   
  i don t think so  quinn 
  quill 
  quill 
i don t think so 
but what i m trying to say   
peter  you know this
is an open line  right 
  what 
  we re listening to everything you re saying 
and it is painful 
and you re just telling me now 
we were hoping it
would stop on its own 
but i switched it over to private 
what color button did you push 
blue  for the blue suit 
  oh  no 
  blue is the open line for everyone 
orange is for blue 
  what 
  black is for orange 
yellow is for green 
green is for red 
and red is for yellow 
no  yellow is for yellow 
green is for red 
red is for green 
  i don t think so 
  try it  then 
hello 
  you were right 
  how the hell am i supposed to know all of that  
seems intuitive 
can we get back to saving our friend 
get that jammer ready
to change the shield 
guys 
i mean  you wanna talk about a sweet ride 
the acceleration will crush your spine 
it s got that brand new fusilux core 
you know what i m talking about 
  oh  yeah 
  really  because i just made that up 
oh  well  i thought you
said something else 
master karja 
  no  you didn t 
  i did    i did 
master karja  there appears to be a physical
breach in the white wing somewhere 
could it be a glitch 
maybe 
i m accessing the eye 
i ll see if i can locate it 
there s some sort of anomaly in the decompression
chamber  best you check it out  master 
on it 
hurry 
where do we put these 
here  hide them in this
locker until we leave 
hurry 
what the hell was that  guys 
what  are you kidding me 
  what 
  a neutral quark just hit the satellite 
it s burning a hole thru the wall  you geniuses  you
just throw the door open without any
proper precautionary procedure 
what procedure  bro 
oh  you want us to read the
manual for you too  bros 
you could have killed everyone in the wing 
exactly  you idiots 
i m angry  too 
oh  no 
i mean  can t you see these authentic mechanic
uniforms that we re wearing on our bodies 
that blend in with some of our
skin tones better than others 
excuse my friend  he is the
boss  nephew  he s a little   
oh   
oh 
yeah  i   
i got one of those too 
i mean  this one  this one  i love 
i m so proud that you   
you re doing great 
so proud of you 
but  uh  this one   
i just   
everything he does drives me crazy 
  i thought you said something else 
  shut up 
i swear i m gonna throttle him 
i m gonna go to jail for murder 
i am 
how did you guys get here so fast 
uh  to be honest with you  we just happened
in before it burned all the way through  thankfully 
ah  good thing you were here 
alright guys  wrap it up 
looks like we re all clear here 
our spacesuits 
ahh  you threw them in the contamination
bin 
it expels stuff into space the
moment you shut the door 
that would have been helpful
information three minutes ago 
dammit  mantis  why don t you ever think 
are we pretending
to be angry again 
mantis  you asshole 
guys  just focus for two seconds 
we ll find another way
out of here  right now   
we need to save rocket s life 
nebula  quinn and i will get to
the records and get the pass key 
bug and doofus  access the spaceport thru the
elevator so tree can land and get us out of here 
  oh  apologies 
  no problem 
go 
it s not my fault i don t know something
if no one ever tells me 
i didn t even want to come here 
i m gonna need to see your   
you re hopelessly in love    with him 
oh  no   
  hey 
  hey 
how are you doing today 
i m alright 
what   what was your name again 
drax the destroyer 
oh  that is such a lovely name 
i ll get the door for you 
  i ll be here when you come back out  okay 
  sure 
every single time 
my name is bletelsnort 
 public address announcer 
welcome to orgocorp headquarters 
for over 300 years orgocorp has been producing cybernetic
implants and genetic upgrades across the universe 
under the watchful eye
of the high evolutionary 
that warning we got today  don t
those two match the description 
attention all orgosentries 
that manager should
have access to the records 
if the pass key is here 
she can get it for us 
all right 
  i ll handle this one 
  how 
pure star lord charm 
i m excited for you that you get to see
this again for the first time 
ahem 
hi  yura 
  ura 
  oh  ura 
  hi 
  hi  my name is patrick swayze 
i ve been noticing you
for quite a while 
and the way that you smile to yourself 
when you think nobody is looking 
it makes my everyday a bit brighter 
we need your hand  and it s your choice
whether it s on your body  or not 
what are you doing 
she was never gonna fall for that 
she was totally into me  man 
i kinda thought you
were a douchebag 
oh  come on 
  we need a file 
  what file 
89p13  could that be something 
  no 
  then your use to us is over 
wait  wait  wait  wait 
wait 
sounds like a species tag 
show us 
 announcer  all of our research supports the
high evolutionary s altruistic objective
of creating a utopian society 
that must be the spaceport 
whoa 
what is all this 
species patented over the
years using orgocorp tech 
every species orgocorp has created
has its own individual file 
i am so sorry about this  listen to me 
this is not the kinda thing we do 
oh  please  stop it
with the subtle jabs 
old you would ve never done this 
you had a purpose higher than
yourself  the calling to help people 
that s why you left thanos
and formed the guardians 
except i didn t form the guardians
and i barely left thanos 
whoever it was that
you were in love with 
it wasn t me 
it sounds more like her 
  her 
  what 
  that s ridiculous   
  do not bring me into this 
  don t even 
  knock it off 
  what 
don t look at me like a lost puppy
needing a soft place to lie down 
i didn t say anything 
i just never noticed how
black your eyes were 
they were replaced by my father
as a method of torture 
he   he picked a pretty set 
there 
that s the file for 89p13 
heads up  heads up 
ugh 
oh  no 
walk 
run  run 
stand down 
drax  we should make a run for it 
  or we could fight 
  run 
  fight 
  run 
  fight 
  take  em 
what are we going to do 
  i got a plan 
  what is it 
all of you  come with   
everybody  lower your weapons or
i blow this woman s brain out 
that s the plan 
  you re a kitty cat 
  meow 
you feel like dancing 
violent rage 
lower your weapons 
now kill that one that looks like a
carrot to show we mean business 
god  past gamora s just mean 
she was always like that 
and yet i was the bad guy 
we are not killing anyone 
back off 
groot  bring the bowie to us  now 
  i m so sorry about this  ura 
  oh  please 
we re here to save the
life of our friend  that is all 
we paid her to help
us get in and get out 
you d think that d mean   oh  i m gonna help you do
it in a way that no one knows it s happening  
but no  what she means is i m gonna
shoot people  threaten people s lives 
shut up 
and i know you re probably
asking  why would i trust her   well   
that s a good question 
the answer is   
we used to be in love 
yeah  she was my girlfriend  only she
doesn t remember it because it wasn t her 
because her dad threw her off a magic cliff and she died 
and then i lost my temper and nearly destroyed half the universe 
then she came back 
out of the past  there she is 
everyone else who died in the past stayed dead  not
her  why  was it the magic cliff  i don t know 
i m not some freakin 
infinity stone scientist 
just some dumbass earth dude
who met a girl  fell in love 
that girl died 
and then came
back a total dick 
you left out some important
information  but   
that is the gist of it 
get to the security helm 
okay 
everybody down on the floor
or we blow your brains out 
hey  hey  hey  hey 
we don t want any   
oh my god 
come on  would you please
stop doing that 
  reasons   earth  wind and fire  
  ah ha ha ha 
  hey 
run 
drax 
get on the ground  and
show me your hands now 
ura   
please listen to me  we need
to get out of here with this 
to save my best friend s life 
if you could get us into the system of those
sentries out there  they are good people  like you   
i m certain of it 
and if i just had an
opportunity to speak to them   
they re corporate shills  you idiot 
they re not gonna listen to you 
they will listen if i speak
to them from my heart 
ura   
please 
hey 
come out now 
damn it 
stop 
you are in 
  tell them your truce   
  yeah  i m not that big of an idiot 
i just needed to get
into the system 
move it 
told you she was into me 
i am groot 
yeah  that looked cool 
is sky 
no 
that s not sky  that s a ceiling 
sire is making a
new world for all of us 
and when we get there 
there will be sky 
and it will be beautiful 
and forever 
  wow 
  wow 
whoa 
i have been thinking 
about what 
oh  nothing in particular 
but i thought  since you
guys are my closest friends 
and my only friends 
you might be interested in knowing
that i have been  thinking 
that s cool 
i ve been thinking  too 
about something more singular 
when sire moves
us to the new world 
we re gonna need names 
i mean  89q12   
not really a name 
so   
i would like my name to be   
lylla 
lylla 
lylla 
lylla 
that s a pretty name  lylla 
thank you 
i think my name shall be teefs 
because although
we all do have them 
mine are definitely
the most prominent 
  teefs 
  teefs 
  lylla 
  teefs 
me be called floor   
because me is lying on floor 
you re lying on a floor 
so your name is floor 
yes 
floor 
what about you  friend 
someday  i m gonna make
great machines that fly 
and me and my friends are
gonna go flying together 
into the forever
and beautiful sky 
lylla  and teefs  and floor   
and me 
rocket 
rocket 
it really is good to have friends 
yeah 
start the incision here 
keep calm 
  hold it still 
  i can t  it won t stop moving 
why did he never tell
us about any of this 
this is worse than what
thanos did to me 
but what about the pass key 
is it there 
no  but a file was
removed today 
downloaded and deleted a
million characters in length 
the biometrics say
it was this man 
recorder b2h6 
i saw this guy outside
of records today 
looks like one of the
high evolutionary s recorders 
the high evolutionary 
the founder of orgocorp 
orgocorp is just a way to fund his
experiments that lie outside intergalactic laws 
he s created whole societies 
xeronians  the ani men 
  sovereign 
  the sovereign 
corners of the universe
consider him god 
  i am groot 
  yes 
yes  what  that he s groot 
he said maybe this man downloaded the
pass key into the computer on his head 
huh 
that could store the pass key 
if we find him  we save rocket 
the high evolutionary s coordinates 
put the coordinates in the nav 
wait a minute 
are you kidding me 
what he wants is that
gutted badger in the med bay 
and you re gonna bring
it straight to him 
it s almost certainly a trap 
a trap isn t a trap if you know the trap
is trying to trap you  it s a face off 
a face off is a trap
if you re facing off against a guy a thousand
times more powerful than you 
do you know who
the high evolutionary is 
yeah  he s some dickhead who
dissected my best friend 
second best 
the high evolutionary isn t someone
you wanna think about messing with 
we won t think about
it when we do it 
you know what  i don t care 
just drop me off with the ravagers and
you go do whatever it is that you wanna do 
we don t have time for this 
i m not asking you  drop me
off with my people now 
your people 
the ravagers aren t your people 
i m a damn ravager  you aren t 
listen  i know you were always
looking for a family  okay 
but my gamora  the one i loved  she
didn t find it with a group of criminals 
she found it with us 
people who care about you 
i know that s who you still are 
somewhere inside of you   
what are you so afraid of in yourself 
that i need to be something for you 
i don t give a shit
about your gamora 
life made me me 
i have a few upgrades courtesy of
that gutted badger in the med bay 
and we are not risking his life
to make yours more convenient 
  i m family 
  so is he 
screw you 
screw all of you 
found him on the outskirts
of the first shield 
pirating supply ships 
i do appreciate this  good sir 
and i appreciate your generous contribution
to the orgosentry retirement fund 
your associate 
a zehoberi named gamora 
  where is she now 
  you ain t getting nothing from me 
oh  we ll see about
that  won t we 
adam 
adam 
  yes  mother 
  show him we mean business 
i said show him we mean business 
not disintegrate him 
well  what business could
we have shown him 
but now he is
of no use to us 
well let s just question the man s friend 
friend  you think that s
a friend  it s an animal 
he looks sad 
i really don t enjoy how that s
making me feel  actually 
your friend s a moron  i got

fitz gibbonok  it s me 
outpost  come in 
yes  gamora 
salutations 
may i help 
well  i need you guys

no one ever listens to me 
quill 
life is a pond 
and you ve spent your entire life leaping from woman to
woman  as if they are lily pads upon this great pond 
perhaps what you need to do  quill   
    is learn to swim 
  that actually made sense 
  yes it made sense 
no  i mean  that s  that s
sort of an analogy 
and i didn t know that you were
capable of that type of thought 
i know lots of analogies  quill 
analogies  metaphors  etcetera 
for instance   
gamora s head is like a lily pad 
because it s green 
analogy 
and also  stupid looking and flappy 
  flappy 
  because her skin is made of a leaf 
  metaphor 
  is it 
yesterday  i made a poop
shaped like a fish 
even my butt is capable
of making an analogy

of a perfect species 
you re simply a   
medley of mistakes we could learn from and
apply to the creatures that truly mattered 
batch 89   
was never meant for
the new world  p13 
you could figure out the complex workings
of cytoplasmic filtration systems 
but you couldn t figure out that 
but that brain

prep it for surgery and
removal in the morning

finest in the universe 
earth would be a fabulous place were
it not for the ignorance and bigotry 
  okay 
  it inspired me to create counter earth 
  i don t care 
  all of the good and none of the bad 
i don t need another speech
by some impotent whackjob
whose mother didn t love him  rationalizing
why he needs to conquer the universe

the only thing we can count on you for  is when someone
shows weakness  you ll be right there to support it

else to make yourself feel okay 
so find it in me 
oh  go to hell  mant 
but you don t have
the right to push him 
it s not his fault he s stupid 
he s a liability 
he makes us laugh and he loves
us  how is that a liability 
all you care about is
intelligence and competence 
not sure i appreciate this defense 
he has sadness   
but he s the only one of you
who doesn t hate himself

pay attention or play with
the kids  one or the other 
  play with the kids 
  how did you get out 
  that s not really important   
  i am groot 
jumping a 1000 feet to your death without a
parachute is a clever way of getting out of a fix 
you re all just making up
stuff that he s saying  right 
the important thing
is we re all okay 
rocket 
yeah  he s here and he s okay 
rocket  we love you very much

well that makes you the idiots  then

you re the one who

the hellspawn had it  sire 
  but

that rancid word 
i m merely wondering
whether it might be wiser 
to go directly to the new colony and
not engage in unnecessary conflict 
they can rewire a carbonetrix
core in under two minutes 
but what is that  vim 
  rote memorization 
  rote memorization 
in hundreds of years of our creations 
only one has known true invention 
one 
putrid in every other way 
but 89p13 had that 
yes  sire 
a populace unable to think 
what hasn t yet been thought  will die
on the vine  we need 89p13 s brain
so we can transfer that
trait into these creatures
before we go to the new colony 
nothing else matters 
how did they get down here 
joob joob 
peter will be trying to
get to the spaceport
