singing im a weirdo
singing i wanna have control
i want a perfect body
hey uhuh
i told you a million times you keep your
grimy raccoon hands off my zune
and i told you a million times
im not a damn raccoon
again
i love you gamora
so what are you
gonna do about quill
me why not you
i got emotionalistical issues
what am i gonna do
why are you on the ceiling
i wanted to see if these new
gravity boots worked on a slope
here we go
sorry
bozhe moi kraglin
you must know you will never learn
you think you could do better
da
davai
telekinesis is cheating
thats a stupid little pebble
i can do that with my dang finger
youre a bad dog
do not say that to me
you are youre a bad dog
take that back come on
thats not cool
nebula did you hear
he called me a bad dog and
he refuse to take it back
i dont care cosmo
is peter okay
i dont know
what are you going to do
me hes your brother
it doesnt matter he still
doesnt listen to me
yeah he has been pretty mopey
ever since gamora died
shes not dead
she just doesnt remember
anything from the past few years
nobody tells me nothing
mantis why dont you just touch him
and you know make him happy
i am groot
gross
no not like that
touch him with her powers
it is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends
what about that time you made
me fall in love with my sock
well that was funny
i guess its back to one of us
touching him the other way
maybe we should draw straws
no one ever meant that drax
crazy on you  heart
what was that
what the hell
where did you go squirrel
on the ground
who is that maniac
some superdouche with ray gun hands
i dont freakin know
who threw this thing at me
shut up
baby
pick on someone your own size
peter
peter
we need med packs
nebula
piss off
that hurts
what a pity
no
all i did was activate the med packs
get them off now
ah hell
we need to get him to the med bay
its destroyed
theres one on the ship
stitch him up and transfer
him in with the rest of batch 89
its okay
youre here with us now
hey whos the new guy
what kind of thing are you
youve got like a
mask on your face
mask eyes face mouth
does it words
its okay friend
dont let them scare you
hurts
its okay
youre gonna be okay
a kill switch
a device
set to destruct if anyone goes
poking around inside him
or even if we use the med packs
why would rocket
have a kill switch
apparently someone considers him proprietary
technology and sent that golden lunatic to get him
so hell die if we operate on him
and hell die if we dont
there has to be some way to bypass it
it looks like theres a pass key
that could override the kill switch
what do we know about
where rocket came from
he wont talk about it
much of the tech was developed
by a company called orgocorp
and theres a code on all of it
89p13
hes got maybe 48 hours
where are you going
orgocorp have to have records right
maybe theyll have a way for us to
override the kill switch and save rocket
they wont just give us that information
well thats why were gonna break in
and kill anyone who gets in our way
not kill anyone
kill a few people
kill no people
kill one guy one stupid guy who no one loves
now youre just making it sad
kraglin cosmo i need you to keep watch over
knowhere till were back couple of days tops
aye capn
aye comrade
take back what you said that im a bad dog
nope
i know you dont really
think i am a bad dog
can you please take it back
i will not
a
i located the coordinates for orgocorp
i think i have a contact near there
maybe they can help us get in
contact him
lets go save our friend
since you been gone  rainbow
its good to have friends
my poor baby
unnh it hurts
do you have it
he does not sire
i tried to warn you
high evolutionary
these guardians are more
powerful than you think
or perhaps you simply overestimate
your own value high priestess
no doubt a flaw of some
type in my own design
i created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment
beautiful numbskulls
but your egos have
run wild say ah
and this one was
meant to be the warlock
the apogee of their people
you removed adam from
his cocoon early my liege
he is still a child
no theres something wrong
with him even outside all that
yes theres something wrong with me
i was stabbed you extraordinary phallus
he doesnt know any better we
shall do whatever you require my liege
you knew of 89p13s existence
for years without alerting me
thats not what i require
im sorry my liege
find 89p13 and return it to me
or i will destroy your entire civilization
as is my right as your maker
do you understand
do you understand
yes sire
toodleloo
how did 89p13 survive
after all these years theel
it was always clever sire
yes thats exactly why i want it now
of course
its brain
that is the only reason sire
but are you really trusting
the sovereign to retrieve it
theyre merely a backup
i believe i know where theyre going
its bioformed
instead of being built its
grown from living matter
the structure is surrounded by three
impenetrable plasmic security shields
its not gonna be easy to
break into this place starlord
it doesnt have to be easy i was
a professional thief remember
ill jam the signals one at a time
she calls me starlord
when shes mad at me
shes always mad at everyone
its because i was drunk
shes right if i hadnt been drinking
maybe rocket im sorry
its okay hes your best friend
second best friend
everyone around me dies
my mother yondu
gamora
gamora isnt dead
she is to us
do you want a zargnut
thank you
first shield set
three two one
peter
what
you had family on earth and you
never wanted to go back to see them
youre my sister thats all
the family i want or need
besides its really just my grandpa
okay hes a pretty hard guy
still dont you think he
what
you were abducted by ravagers
the same day he lost his daughter
oh yeah he was upset my mom died he screamed
in my face he pushed me out of the room
he was probably just trying to protect you
what are you talking about
what
im talking about the people in my life who died
youre talking about this
second shield set
three two one
im only saying youve never
even gone to see if hes okay
he could still be alive
my grandpa hed be like 90
something years old
so he could still be alive
people on earth die
when theyre like 50
they die when theyre 50
i dont know something like that
whats even the
point of being born
exactly
are you about to die
im not 50
the point is i wasnt talking
about any of this
third shield set
three two one
well not everything is about
what you are talking about
and im only saying you are upset because so
many of the people you cared about have left you
but you also left someone
and maybe i wanted a zargnut
its too late theyre all gone
why didnt we go through
we did its not the shield
oh hell
ravagers
hey guys youre about to be
boarded by the united ravagers
you can surrender and turn over any stuff
worth anything and live or you can die
its up to you
drax no no no drax
guys its me peter quill
im one of you remember
hold on
we have an appointment
we have an appointment
with who
with gamora
with gamora
what
youre early
grunt
grunt
what are these
orgocorp uniforms
you have to wear these to move through
the orgo without attracting attention
this isnt my color
what did you say
it clashes with my eyes
put it on
nebula why would you not tell me that
youve been in contact with gamora
because i didnt want
you to get freaked out
freaked out how
like that
let me in there i dont want to be trapped
out here
gamora were grateful for your help
im not doing this out of
the kindness of my heart
im doing this for the hundred
thousand units my sister promised
so youre a ravager now
put on the uniform
never pictured you as the ravager type
who are you again
oh man
orgocorp is in possession of some of the
most advanced cybergenetic ip in the galaxy
so theyre heavily guarded
by the deadly orgosentries
now i know you dont have
documentation to dock
so youre gonna have to
get in there on your own
once in gamora is gonna
lead you to the records
where maybe you can find the
pass key to override the kill switch
and help you save the hedgehog
but if you get into trouble
we will not be able
to bail you out
yes
yes of course
its functioning has skyrocketed
thats correct p13 very good
thats the new world
counterearth
where the experiments will
go once theyre ready
it blue
thats the sky
sky
rocket
yes it is
what sounds
thats music
we like it
we do
this recording is over 5000 years old
speaks foreign language
which translated is
be not as you are
but as you should be
its our sacred mission
to take the cacophony
of sounds around us
and turn it into a song
to take an imperfect clump of
biological matter such as you
and transform it into something
perfect
and were halfway there arent we
come with me p13
id like to show you something
we have but a single quest
to create the perfect species
and the perfect society
you p13
are part of batch 89
but here with batch 90
ive developed a process
by which i can guide
any organism through millions of years of
programmed evolutionary changes in a moment
see now
theres the rub
for some reason these specimens
are also overproducing the legobeta
microsamino protein in their systems
causing them to be well
violent we dont like it
a utopia cant have its denizens
murdering one another can it
they cants
cant
cant
theel
theyre programmed to be peaceful like you
but for some reason its not catching
heptonic filters
what
they suppresaliding the glycusolided
saltses
and then boop boop boop
absisting residual deformant
and then they make um
what do you say
the legobeta microsamino proteins
yeah thems
and then angry turtleses
huh
in the meantime  spacehog
there thats the decompression chamber
lock in
go
activate gravity boots and gloves
nebula go
so you really dont remember anything
like what
about your time with us
no
well we were
we werent anything
you and me
that person was some alternate future version of me
wasnt me
we loved each other
i dont think so
i know you dont remember any of it
but you were everything to me
and i miss you
so much
and maybe
maybe if you open yourself up to it
theres a possibility
i dont think so quinn
quill
quill
i dont think so
but what im trying to say
peter you know this
is an open line right
what
were listening to everything youre saying
and it is painful
and youre just telling me now
we were hoping it
would stop on its own
but i switched it over to private
what color button did you push
blue for the blue suit
oh no
blue is the open line for everyone
orange is for blue
what
black is for orange
yellow is for green
green is for red
and red is for yellow
no yellow is for yellow
green is for red
red is for green
i dont think so
try it then
hello
you were right
how the hell am i supposed to know all of that
seems intuitive
can we get back to saving our friend
get that jammer ready
to change the shield
guys
i mean you wanna talk about a sweet ride
the acceleration will crush your spine
its got that brand new fusilux core
you know what im talking about
oh yeah
really because i just made that up
oh well i thought you
said something else
master karja
no you didnt
i did i did
master karja there appears to be a physical
breach in the white wing somewhere
could it be a glitch
maybe
im accessing the eye
ill see if i can locate it
theres some sort of anomaly in the decompression
chamber best you check it out master
on it
hurry
where do we put these
here hide them in this
locker until we leave
hurry
what the hell was that guys
what are you kidding me
what
a neutral quark just hit the satellite
its burning a hole thru the wall you geniuses you
just throw the door open without any
proper precautionary procedure
what procedure bro
oh you want us to read the
manual for you too bros
you could have killed everyone in the wing
exactly you idiots
im angry too
oh no
i mean cant you see these authentic mechanic
uniforms that were wearing on our bodies
that blend in with some of our
skin tones better than others
excuse my friend he is the
boss nephew hes a little
oh
oh
yeah i
i got one of those too
i mean this one this one i love
im so proud that you
youre doing great
so proud of you
but uh this one
i just
everything he does drives me crazy
i thought you said something else
shut up
i swear im gonna throttle him
im gonna go to jail for murder
i am
how did you guys get here so fast
uh to be honest with you we just happened
in before it burned all the way through thankfully
ah good thing you were here
alright guys wrap it up
looks like were all clear here
our spacesuits
ahh you threw them in the contamination
bin
it expels stuff into space the
moment you shut the door
that would have been helpful
information three minutes ago
dammit mantis why dont you ever think
are we pretending
to be angry again
mantis you asshole
guys just focus for two seconds
well find another way
out of here right now
we need to save rockets life
nebula quinn and i will get to
the records and get the pass key
bug and doofus access the spaceport thru the
elevator so tree can land and get us out of here
oh apologies
no problem
go
its not my fault i dont know something
if no one ever tells me
i didnt even want to come here
im gonna need to see your
youre hopelessly in love with him

ill get the door for you
ill be here when you come back out okay
sure
every single time
my name is bletelsnort
public address announcer
welcome to orgocorp headquarters
for over 300 years orgocorp has been producing cybernetic
implants and genetic upgrades across the universe
under the watchful eye
of the high evolutionary
that warning we got today dont
those two match the description
attention all orgosentries
that manager should
have access to the records
if the pass key is here
she can get it for us
all right
ill handle this one
how
pure starlord charm
im excited for you that you get to see
this again for the first time
ahem
hi yura
ura
oh ura
hi
hi my name is patrick swayze
ive been noticing you
for quite a while
and the way that you smile to yourself
when you think nobody is looking
it makes my everyday a bit brighter
we need your hand and its your choice
whether its on your body or not
what are you doing
she was never gonna fall for that
she was totally into me man
i kinda thought you
were a douchebag
oh come on
we need a file
what file
89p13 could that be something
no
then your use to us is over
wait wait wait wait
wait
sounds like a species tag
show us
announcer all of our research supports the
high evolutionarys altruistic objective
of creating a utopian society
that must be the spaceport
whoa
what is all this
species patented over the
years using orgocorp tech
every species orgocorp has created
has its own individual file
i am so sorry about this listen to me
this is not the kinda thing we do
oh please stop it
with the subtle jabs
old you wouldve never done this
you had a purpose higher than
yourself the calling to help people
thats why you left thanos
and formed the guardians
except i didnt form the guardians
and i barely left thanos
whoever it was that
you were in love with
it wasnt me
it sounds more like her
her
what
thats ridiculous
do not bring me into this
dont even
knock it off
what
dont look at me like a lost puppy
needing a soft place to lie down
i didnt say anything
i just never noticed how
black your eyes were
they were replaced by my father
as a method of torture
hehe picked a pretty set
there
thats the file for 89p13
heads up heads up
ugh
oh no
walk
run run
stand down
drax we should make a run for it
or we could fight
run
fight
run
fight
take em
what are we going to do
i got a plan
what is it
all of you come with
everybody lower your weapons or
i blow this womans brain out
thats the plan
youre a kitty cat
meow
you feel like dancing
violent rage
lower your weapons
now kill that one that looks like a
carrot to show we mean business
god past gamoras just mean
she was always like that
and yet i was the bad guy
we are not killing anyone
back off
groot bring the bowie to us now
im so sorry about this ura
oh please
were here to save the
life of our friend that is all
we paid her to help
us get in and get out
youd think thatd mean oh im gonna help you do
it in a way that no one knows its happening
but no what she means is im gonna
shoot people threaten peoples lives
shut up
and i know youre probably
asking why would i trust her well
thats a good question
the answer is
we used to be in love
yeah she was my girlfriend only she
doesnt remember it because it wasnt her
because her dad threw her off a magic cliff and she died
and then i lost my temper and nearly destroyed half the universe
then she came back
out of the past there she is
everyone else who died in the past stayed dead not
her why was it the magic cliff i dont know
im not some freakin
infinity stone scientist
just some dumbass earth dude
who met a girl fell in love
that girl died
and then came
back a total dick
you left out some important
information but
that is the gist of it
get to the security helm
okay
everybody down on the floor
or we blow your brains out
hey hey hey hey
we dont want any
oh my god
come on would you please
stop doing that
reasons  earth wind and fire
ah ha ha ha
hey
run
drax
get on the ground and
show me your hands now
ura
please listen to me we need
to get out of here with this
to save my best friends life
if you could get us into the system of those
sentries out there they are good people like you
im certain of it
and if i just had an
opportunity to speak to them
theyre corporate shills you idiot
theyre not gonna listen to you
they will listen if i speak
to them from my heart
ura
please
hey
come out now
damn it
stop
you are in
tell them your truce
yeah im not that big of an idiot
i just needed to get
into the system
move it
told you she was into me
i am groot
yeah that looked cool
is sky
no
thats not sky thats a ceiling
sire is making a
new world for all of us
and when we get there
there will be sky
and it will be beautiful
and forever
wow
wow
whoa
i have been thinking
about what
oh nothing in particular
but i thought since you
guys are my closest friends
and my only friends
you might be interested in knowing
that i have been thinking
thats cool
ive been thinking too
about something more singular
when sire moves
us to the new world
were gonna need names
i mean 89q12
not really a name
so
i would like my name to be
lylla
lylla
lylla
lylla
thats a pretty name lylla
thank you
i think my name shall be teefs
because although
we all do have them
mine are definitely
the most prominent
teefs
teefs
lylla
teefs
me be called floor
because me is lying on floor
youre lying on a floor
so your name is floor
yes
floor
what about you friend
someday im gonna make
great machines that fly
and me and my friends are
gonna go flying together
into the forever
and beautiful sky
lylla and teefs and floor
and me
rocket
rocket
it really is good to have friends
yeah
start the incision here
keep calm
hold it still
i cant it wont stop moving
why did he never tell
us about any of this
this is worse than what
thanos did to me
but what about the pass key
is it there
no but a file was
removed today
downloaded and deleted a
million characters in length
the biometrics say
it was this man
recorder b2h6
i saw this guy outside
of records today
looks like one of the
high evolutionarys recorders
the high evolutionary
the founder of orgocorp
orgocorp is just a way to fund his
experiments that lie outside intergalactic laws
hes created whole societies
xeronians the animen
sovereign
the sovereign
corners of the universe
consider him god
i am groot
yes
yes what that hes groot
he said maybe this man downloaded the
pass key into the computer on his head
huh
that could store the pass key
if we find him we save rocket
the high evolutionarys coordinates
put the coordinates in the nav
wait a minute
are you kidding me
what he wants is that
gutted badger in the med bay
and youre gonna bring
it straight to him
its almost certainly a trap
a trap isnt a trap if you know the trap
is trying to trap you its a faceoff
a faceoff is a trap
if youre facing off against a guy a thousand
times more powerful than you
do you know who
the high evolutionary is
yeah hes some dickhead who
dissected my best friend
second best
the high evolutionary isnt someone
you wanna think about messing with
we wont think about
it when we do it
you know what i dont care
just drop me off with the ravagers and
you go do whatever it is that you wanna do
we dont have time for this
im not asking you drop me
off with my people now
your people
the ravagers arent your people
im a damn ravager you arent
listen i know you were always
looking for a family okay
but my gamora the one i loved she
didnt find it with a group of criminals
she found it with us
people who care about you
i know thats who you still are
somewhere inside of you
what are you so afraid of in yourself
that i need to be something for you
i dont give a shit
about your gamora
life made me me
i have a few upgrades courtesy of
that gutted badger in the med bay
and we are not risking his life
to make yours more convenient
im family
so is he
screw you
screw all of you
found him on the outskirts
of the first shield
pirating supply ships
i do appreciate this good sir
and i appreciate your generous contribution
to the orgosentry retirement fund
your associate
a zehoberi named gamora
where is she now
you aint getting nothing from me
oh well see about
that wont we
adam
adam
yes mother
show him we mean business
i said show him we mean business
not disintegrate him
well what business could
we have shown him
but now he is
of no use to us
well lets just question the mans friend
friend you think thats
a friend its an animal
he looks sad
i really dont enjoy how thats
making me feel actually
your friends a moron i got
one of those too i get it
outpost
this is gamora are you there
fitzgibbonok its me
outpost come in
yes gamora
salutations
may i help
well i need you guys
to come pick me up
im gonna upload the location
link to the craft im on
oh i think we can arrange that
do you realize  the flaming lips
you need to say to him exactly
what i told you to say
why dont you just say it
no one ever listens to me
quill
life is a pond
and youve spent your entire life leaping from woman to
woman as if they are lily pads upon this great pond
perhaps what you need to do quill
is learn to swim
that actually made sense
yes it made sense
no i mean thats thats
sort of an analogy
and i didnt know that you were
capable of that type of thought
i know lots of analogies quill
analogies metaphors etcetera
for instance
gamoras head is like a lily pad
because its green
analogy
and also stupidlooking and flappy
flappy
because her skin is made of a leaf
metaphor
is it
yesterday i made a poop
shaped like a fish
even my butt is capable
of making an analogy
oh
whats happening
the fluid is in his lungs
p13
p13
sire
p13
sire was in the middle of his treatment thats
when we had a breakthrough with that shiny tube
perhaps then we should resume tomorrow
yes
we will not resume tomorrow no
p13
oh ooh there you are
hello
how did you know about
the microsamino proteins p13
what happened in there
why
how did you know p13
it was too little filtration
in the hypotomic yes we know
we fixed that
but how did you know
i made you
how did you know
because it worked
it worked
their rage is gone
we have the peaceful creatures
we always sought
ready to inhabit the new world
were going to the new world
oh we
look at you
as if you were cobbled
together by fatfingered children
how could you be part
of a perfect species
youre simply a
medley of mistakes we could learn from and
apply to the creatures that truly mattered
batch 89
was never meant for
the new world p13
you could figure out the complex workings
of cytoplasmic filtration systems
but you couldnt figure out that
but that brain
that id like to study further
prep it for surgery and
removal in the morning
what about the rest
of batch 89 sire
incinerate them
hes dying we need that pass key
we dont have long
weve arrived
we care a lot  faith no more
that looks just like home
its like a replica of earth
it makes no sense
atmosphere is habitable
gravity xandarminusone
hello we mean
you no harm
alien language
listen to me he was just trying
to throw her back her ball
ow

its an act of blasphemy
even having it here
kill it now
i am the warlock mum and i am
done with being ordered around

counterearth
i visited your planet many years ago
earth hasnt been my
planet in a long time

finest in the universe
earth would be a fabulous place were
it not for the ignorance and bigotry
okay
it inspired me to create counterearth
i dont care
all of the good and none of the bad
i dont need another speech

whose mother didnt love him rationalizing
why he needs to conquer the universe
im not trying to
conquer the universe

rest of us having to carry your slack

so find it in me
oh go to hell mant
but you dont have
the right to push him
its not his fault hes stupid
hes a liability

hands that guide the hands
my beloved raccoon
this story has been yours
all along you just didnt know it
im not a raccoo
the pass keys going through
quill
wheres nebula
she shes uh

the comm behind you

the high evolutionarys ship
no i got off the ship
you what
wait where are you
on the ship
on the ship
i didnt lie
why are you on the ship
to save you obviously
no i told you to go back you gotta know by now i
always figure out an incredibly clever way to get out of a fix
tell him i said hi
really
tell him were coming to save him
pay attention or play with
the kids one or the other
play with the kids
how did you get out
thats not really important
i am groot
jumping a 1000 feet to your death without a
parachute is a clever way of getting out of a fix
youre all just making up
stuff that hes saying right
the important thing
is were all okay
rocket
yeah hes here and hes okay
rocket we love you very much
and were happy youre alive
well that makes you the idiots then
hes right about that
back in your cages
nebula
nebula come in
so youd like to joust would you
go to hell you sick
son of a bitch
you killed all of those people
as i will your friends
im sending you the coordinates
they will die unless you
bring me what is mine
screw you you stretchfaced robocoplooking
skeletorwannabe purplenurple piece of
he hung up
you think
poor girl  x
the soviets put me on a rocket
knowing full well i never to return
and i will die in a fiery ball of death
the one thing even mudak soviets never do
is call me bad dog
oh my god just just let it go
kraglin please just take it back
this is killing us
i cant take it back if she
is in fact a bad dog
it never stops hurting
kraglin
oh hey pete
we need to save
nebula mantis and drax
and we need your help
me
youre the one who
lost him you twit
the hellspawn had it sire
but
but but but but but
that rancid word
im merely wondering
whether it might be wiser
to go directly to the new colony and
not engage in unnecessary conflict
they can rewire a carbonetrix
core in under two minutes
but what is that vim
rote memorization
rote memorization
in hundreds of years of our creations
only one has known true invention
one
putrid in every other way
but 89p13 had that
yes sire
a populace unable to think
what hasnt yet been thought will die
on the vine we need 89p13s brain
so we can transfer that
trait into these creatures
before we go to the new colony
nothing else matters
how did they get down here
joob joob
peter will be trying to
get to the spaceport
he doesnt know about the children
you
we need you to let all the other children onboard
know to stay away from the starboard walls
joob joob

what the hell are you
doing mantis
