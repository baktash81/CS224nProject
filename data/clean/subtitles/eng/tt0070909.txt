   confirm a reading of gamma 505 786 
see if you have all that 
kappa 505 899   
this is delos control to station 3 
you re cleared on vector 79  on a 195 
we anticipate a scan
in about four and a half minutes 
i m not worried at all  i m just c   
thanks 
i m just curious 
how much do they weigh 
  three or 4 pounds 
  that heavy 
do they have much of a kick 
a colt  45 
well  i never fired one before 
hey 
what about that thing
where you go like this over the gun 
  fanning 
  yeah 
what about it 
  is that hard to do 
  no 
now  when they give you
the gun belt   
   does it have those strings
to tie around your leg 
  if that s the kind you want 
  that s the kind i want 
i think it s probably better
for quick draws  you know 
it all depends 
what kind of gun belt did you have
the last time 
i had the one without the strings 
  and you could draw fast 
  mm hm 
hmm  then maybe
it doesn t matter after all 
  the guns they give you are real guns 
  mm hm 
  real guns 
  ha 
that s incredible 
give us a shift to 197
and take it down to 443 
we have negative acceleration of 22   
   so long as you maintain
passenger comfort

according to the log at 041 
the
orientation on the resort will now begin 
please put on your earphones 
don t you wanna listen 
i heard it the last time 
   consists of three separate resort
areas  each with its own special appeal 
whichever resort you ve chosen   
   we are sure you will have
a fascinating and rewarding stay here 
here it is possible to relive
the excitement   
   and stresses of pioneer life
to the fullest 
western world
is a life of lawless violence   
   a society of guns and action 
this is medieval world  where we have
reconstructed 13th century europe 
a world of chivalry and combat 
romance and excitement 
our teams of engineers have spared
no expense in this re creation   
   precise to the smallest detail 
then we have roman world 
a lusty treat for the senses in the setting
of delightful  decadent pompeii 
here the traveler experiences
the sensual  relaxed morality   
   that existed at the peak
of the imperial roman empire 
all together 
these resorts comprise delos   
   the most exciting vacation spot
in the history of man 
this is delos control to station 3 
your negative deceleration
should be 25   
   and ground speed should be 355
and dropping 
the whole spectrum of technology
has been employed in delos   
   for the vacationer s pleasure 
expensive and unusual   
   delos is not for everyone 
but for those that choose it   
   it is truly a unique
and rewarding experience 
think about transferring

balance controls don t seem to help me 
i m keeping this in real time 
switch me over to an online status
and i ll do it manually 
you ve got a 3 millisecond cycle delay
which should be computed in 
i don t know what to do
if the stagecoach is late 
oh  it s fantastic 
i reckon that s everything 
bath s down the hall 
bath will cost you two bits

don t look like much here 
but we have everything 
just a minute 
  you mean to tell me he s a robot 
  that s what i mean to tell you 
i m paying  1000 a day for this 
well  it s authentic 
the west of the 1880s 
well  at least they could have made it
a little more comfortable 
that s the point 
this is really the way it was 
if you wanted comfort 
you should have stayed in chicago 
hey  julie would have loved all this 
poking around for hours in all those
funny shops  looking for silly   
peter  what the hell s wrong with you 
you re a lawyer 
you know better than anybody else
what a ride she took you for 
  well  the kids 
  well  fine  the kids 
here you are  six months later 
still thinking about it 
no  not really 
just came to mind  is all 
there s a lot to do here 
  what ll it be 
  whiskey 
what about you 
uh  vodka martini on the rocks
with a twist of lemon  very dry  please 
just give him whiskey 
he s new in town 
  you gotta get into the feel of the thing 
  i feel silly 
why 
it looks like a joke 
well  it s not a joke 
it s an amusement park 
the best amusement park in the world 
all you have to do is have fun 
some pretty rough looking
customers here 
  how many of them are    
  guests like us 
who knows  that s the beauty
of this place  it doesn t matter 
it may look rough 
but it s still just a resort 
there s no way to get hurt here 
just enjoy yourself 
what is this stuff 
it doesn t say 
  god  give me this 
  puts hair on your chest 
yeah 
sloppy with your drink 
  get this boy a bib 
  ha 
yes  sir 
  go on 
  no 
he needs his mama 
kill him  if you don t kill him   
you talk too much 
you say something  boy 
i said  you talk too much 
why don t you make me shut up 
your move 
pretty realistic  huh 
listen  are you sure he was a    
of course  you don t really think
you shot anybody  do you 
wow 
hey  john   
   how do i know i m not gonna kill
another guest with this thing 
try it 
shoot me 
go on  shoot 
shoot 
the gun has a sensing device 
it won t fire at anything
with a high body temperature 
only something cold  like a machine 
hmm 
they thought of everything 
the black knight won t be
repaired till tomorrow afternoon 
the dungeon lighting is 55 
repeat  55 
yeah  i have the banquet scheduled
for 5 30  if that conforms 
well  what do folks do for companionly
entertainment in this town 
i wouldn t know about such things 
i m just running this hotel 
miss carrie has a real nice saloon
down at the end of the street 
now  i won t have talk of that woman
in this house  not over my dinner 
the food s real good  ma am 
thank you  stranger 
you re a gentleman of some breeding 
isn t she terrific 
who s miss carrie 
uh   
you fellas new in town 
yep 
whiskey 
just passing through 
maybe 
looking for some fun 
maybe 
well  you come to the right place 
there s plenty of fun here 
that s cindy and arlette 
arlette s from paris 
perhaps you gentlemen
are taking a liking to them 
perhaps 
  they re real accommodating 
  john 
they  uh   
  they look it 
  john  listen   
why don t you just go on upstairs
and we ll reckon accounts later 
  john  are those    
  sounds good to me 
are those two girls machines 
now  how can you say
a thing like that 
come on 
what s going on 
  they re robbing the bank 
  robbing the bank 
  hey  maybe we ought to go help out 
  uh uh 
you don t know 
it might be fun to fight bank robbers 
look  pete  this is better 
there  uh   
there is something i have to tell you 
i don t know if it matters   
   but it matters to me 
i haven t ever had a  uh   
a   
well  i hardly know you 
if you know what i mean 
i mean  we just met
a few minutes ago 
and  uh   
you re probably very nice 
i feel funny 
why 
i think you re very nice 
how was it  wasn t it terrific 
boy  machines are the servant of man 
wasn t that great 
not bad 
 not bad   now you re the big lover 
well  you know how it is 
some guys have a way with women 
shooting stopped 
i guess we missed the robbery 
you can t have everything 
mm mm 
  john   
  hmm 
   this place is really fun 
i think it s the gyro unit 
  what do you think 
  i wonder if we shouldn t rewire her 
i d replace the
whole unit rather than try to repair it 
with a 10 
use an xx 50 if we have any 
the double x s have a longer lifespan 
a 50 may not fit in here 
well  maybe you can shift the
integrator unit further up into the cavity 
i ll try 
  mm  balance servo again 
  yeah  she fell over this afternoon 
i think it s the sensor  but if it s the
central unit  we ll have to open her up 
well  you get a confirmation
before you do that 
  what s he in for 
  central malfunction 
another one  hmm 
from the day we opened   
   we had a failure and breakdown rate
conforming to computer predictions 
that is  0 3 malfunctions
for each 24 hour activation period   
   concurrent or not 
now  this was an anticipated operations
aspect of the resort   
   and we were fully able to handle it 
the majority of the breakdowns
were minor or peripheral   
   until about six weeks ago 
then roman world
had a rise in breakdown rate   
   which doubled in a week 
in addition  we saw
a disproportionate rise in central   
   as opposed to peripheral 
breakdowns 
now  we identified some problems
with humidity control   
   and regained homeostasis 
well  despite our corrections 
the breakdown rate continued to climb 
then medieval world began
to have trouble 
now we re seeing
more western world breakdowns 
there s a clear pattern here
which suggests an analogy   
   to an infectious disease process 
spreading from one area to the next 
perhaps there are superficial similarities
to disease 
it s only a theoretical concept 
there are many ways to order that data 
i must confess  i find it difficult
to believe in a disease of machinery 
but we aren t dealing
with ordinary machines here 
these are highly complicated
pieces of equipment   
   almost as complicated
as living organisms 
in some cases  they ve been designed
by other computers 
we don t know exactly how they work 
that input goes out at level 55
for pulse forms of 039 duration 
we ll try to stabilize there 
okay  my telemetry is good 
repeat  i have good telemetry 
we have sunrise at 0 43 
ready on all quadrants 
energize grid 
grid energized  confirmed 
all right  then give me 436 
if you can patch that in  if not  435 
i have sound now 
thank you very much 
yes  i want scrambled eggs and bacon
and cinnamon toast 
do you have cinnamon toast  you do 
okay  send it down
to central control room  console 3 
wait a minute  now  what was that 
no grounding  unit 5 
try a bypass 
i have readings on all units  5 included 
hold on a minute 
all right  let s stand by
for resort activation 
you ready on phase 443 
four four three 
okay  we re gonna activate at 59 
lower gain alpha 2 
ready on six  on five  on four   
   on three  on two  activate now 
what do you want 
not one word 
you mind if i finish shaving 
have you no sense of de    
was he bothering you 
he isn t gonna bother you again 
well  i m here to tell you that things
have changed 
there s law here now 
you can t go around plugging
whoever you please 
but  sheriff  it was self defense 
that s what they all say 
he shot a man 
he ll have to stand trial 
judge will be here next week 
if i were you  i wouldn t trouble
over your friend here 
judge benson likes to hang them 
hang them high 
  look  sheriff   
  beat it 
i said  beat it 
i ve never been in jail before 
first time for everything 
but i haven t done anything wrong 
well  you shot a man 
that s something 
  where you from 
  chicago 
well  chicago s a long way
from here  fella 
a thousand miles and more 
hold it 
i guess that sort of makes us
desperados 
yeah  i guess 
well  what do we do now 
well  the way i figure it 
anything we want 
  there s no law in that town now 
  i ll say 
  we go in there   
  we do anything we want 
you know what 
  what 
  i almost believe all this 
well  why shouldn t you believe it 
it s as real as anything else 
yep  i reckon 
  what can you give me in grid 7 
  we have that on sm 514 
transfer  now 
transferred 
reschedule 
she wants to meet the king 
we have to restructure for that 
can t disappoint a guest 
listen  this is the third day in a row   
   that i ve called you
about my laundry 
you ve got all my shirts   
we re rechecking the tapes
on the mechanism now 
we have programmed infidelity in the
queen as of  uh  two minutes ago 
all right  coming up on the castle 
zero  now 
it also conforms with your
five year history at this time of year 
leave me now 
my queen 
if the king should hear of this 
we would both be put to death 
i would be more than happy
to die for you  my lady 
let us pray it shall not be so 
i have news 
the black knight has returned
and seeks a match with you 
  the black knight 
  none other 
is he pretty tough 
he has the strength of 10 
and cunning besides 
but his sight is weak in his left eye 
stay to his left and you will prevail
and win the day 
confirmation of the reprogramming
of that black knight   
   for left lateral weakness and
instability for tomorrow 
i shall see you on the morrow 
my lady 
the schedule of tomorrow a m 
it s his last day in the resort 
let s make it a lulu 
tomorrow a m   broadswords 
schedule locked 
we have a problem with
the air conditioning in beta section 
send a crew out 
yes  he can be sheriff
any time he wants 
that is correct 
just give him the badge 
now  i m the new law around here 
you think you can handle things 
you wanna try me 
a thousand pardons  milord 
what is your name  child 
daphne 
daphne 
oh  i love this place 
i love my horse 
  i love my horse and i love julie 
  oh  shut up  will you 
i like the spots on my horse 
  did you see the spots on the horse 
  your horse is beautiful 
  thank you very much  i liked yours too 
  thank you 
look out 
let me handle this 
get it  get it  john 
goddamn it 
  do you suppose it s real 
  hell  no 
that s not supposed to happen 
maybe it is 
maybe it s part of the thing 
the hell  goddamn machines  anyway 
that s not supposed to happen 
  a rattlesnake struck a guest 
  he was shooting at it and missed 
even so  the snakes are programmed
never to strike 
  was the guest injured 
  minor puncture wounds 
inexcusable to injure a guest  pick up
that snake for a total post at once 
check all the snake s central mechanisms
tonight during the repair period 
doesn t anything work around here 
logic circuits on the snake
simply failed to respond 
there was no sign of
mechanical damage or tampering   
   and no clue to the malfunction 
central mechanism psychosis 
i feel we should shut down the resort
for a month 
oh  that seems rash 
well  a snake injured a guest 
we can t allow that to happen 
many elements of the delos resort
are potentially dangerous 
that s part of the appeal 
but if they become truly   
i agree 
we can announce
that the resort is overbooked   
   and not allow any further
new guests to arrive 
we can take care of the ones
already here 
if we can t insure the safety of
the guests  we re in desperate trouble 
but we can insure their safety 
everything s fine 
all right  let s start that bar fight 
cheat 
  john  what do you say 
  uh    hit me 
now  that s just rude 
okay 
hey  look out  look out 
whoa 
hey  sheriff  come on 
come on  let s go upstairs 
look out 
yeah  woo hoo 
yeah 
  what s his problem 
  nothing 
he got shot up today 
so we re taking the opportunity   
     to replace the visual cortex 
  mm hm 
using the new infrared units 
and we re increasing audio sensitivity 
  you called for me  my lord 
  yes 
how long have you been
in the palace  daphne 
  since i was 3  my lord 
  aww   
charming 
i think we ought to get to know
each other better  daphne 
better  milord 
i can reward you well 
milord 
daphne 
milord 
daphne 
milord forgets himself 
uh oh  problem with
the girl  program breakdown 
what s the trouble 
one of the castle machines
isn t responding 
refusing a guest s seduction 
get her out of there 
report it to central repair 
right 
refusing 
  did you find the trouble 
  no apparent trouble 
but she wasn t following
programming 
she refused a guest s seduction 
and she is a sex model 
  certainly is 
  you think they re gonna shut down 
no  the directors feel to close down now
would hurt tourist confidence 
i don t like it 
breakfast 
i m never gonna drink again

some will begin to run down in an hour 
others can go a full 12 
  turn the main grid back on 
  the relays must be frozen 
we can t get back our power 
hello  hello  hello
