well guess what
there might be a pop quiz cause
you called me old man have a seat
all right and for your information
im middleaged big difference
all right everybody
put those phones down
let me holla at yall real quick
i know when you woke up this morning
you wasnt sure what today was gonna be
but guess what its a special day
today is the day
we craft your college essays
yay laughs
now look im not trying
to put no pressure on you at all
im lying its a lot of pressure
i mean these essays can determine the
whole trajectory of your life laughs
and ima help you with that
mr weavers gonna help you write
some of the best essays in the state
my classroom nobody else gonna care
but us but itll be a big deal to me
so i came up with three questions to help
you write the perfect college essay
question number one what
do you hope to accomplish in college
what do you wanna do once you get there
do you actually wanna go there to learn
or do you wanna just go there
and play around
beer pong physics think about that
number two
what special attributes do you have
that should qualify you for consideration
why should a university accept you
what do you have to offer
and not even just to a university
to the world
what are your best attributes
and finally the last question
and it comes from
one of my favorite poets mary oliver
what do you wanna do with your one
wild and precious life
mary oliver
one of the greats to ever do it
think about that
you got one life to live
what are you gonna do with it
now get to it
and if my heart should somehow stop
by james vincent mcmorrow playing
amy zach zach zach hey
chuckles
um is everything okay
im okay
well im really sorry
about your emergency surgery
im sure that was like really scary
its just the zach sobiech i know
wouldnt leave a girl stranded at the park
and never talk to her again
school bell rings
im terminal
you should you should go
youre gonna be late
exhales
knocking slowly
zach
honey what are you
baby its freezing
im gonna get you a blanket
here
what happened
in mr weavers class we were supposed
to write a a college essay
mmhmm
i mean
whats the point
of writing a college essay
when im never even
going to make it to college
whats the point of anything now
hon what youre facing
knowing that your time is limited
it is scary
and awful and i hate it
ive been thinking lately that none of us
are really promised tomorrow
we all just assume its gonna be there
maybe its kinda like a painting
when youre standing too close to it
you can see dark bits
and you can see light bits but
you dont really know what youre
looking at until you take a step back
so maybe as much as this sucks
maybe this is some
kind of weird chance for you
to forget about all the superficial stuff
that people waste their time on
you get to decide what matters most now
you get to choose
what your paintings gonna look like
man narrating
catherine latapie was the first person
to be miraculously cured at lourdes
she was healed of paralysis in 1858
physical miracles
are an extraordinary phenomenon
but many other pilgrims
make their way to lourdes
for moral healing or spiritual comfort
less spectacular miracles perhaps
but nevertheless
important for those catholics
rob sighs groans
whats that
oh its
where were you
work just trying to catch up
what are you watching
i was thinking our family
could really use a vacation
vacation now
when else
zachs always wanted to see the world

can be really healing
that its been curing people
water really
he had 24 rounds of chemo
yeah i think i know how many rounds
of chemo hes had
well then you know how much
disappointment hes already had
and taking him and dragging him
weve all been disappointed
that doesnt mean
we just give up on our son
whispering
im not giving up on our son okay
i just wanna save him from this crazy idea
that a miracle could
all of a sudden happen
just cause we went
across the fricking ocean for it
we need this
alli mom i cant find my headphones

i fell down down down
into this dark and lonely hole
there was no one there
to care about me anymore
and i needed a way
to climb and grab a hold of the edge
you were sitting there holding a rope
and well go up up up
but ill fly a little higher
go up in the clouds
because the views a little nicer
up here my dear
it wont be long now
it wont be long now

well go up up up
but ill fly a little higher
go up in the clouds

up here my dear
it wont be long now
it wont be long now
bagpipes playing amazing grace
sighs
zachs voice wanna know a little secret
most teenagers out there
feel like theyre invincible
not the superman kind of invincible
the kind of invincible
that tricks you into thinking tomorrow
might be a better day
to start chasing your dreams
now look i know it probably seems weird
for me to write a college essay
when most likely i wont make it there
but i wasnt about to let a little thing
like cancer earn me my first f
so if by some miracle
i get the chance to go to college
i will coax every ounce
of experience i can out of it
but if i dont thats okay too
mouths rob
because i plan to get as far as i can
with my limited time
see we all have limited time
so what is it i plan to do
with my one wild and precious life
its really simple actually
i just wanna make people happy
as much as i can for as long as i can
and in the end i hope my story
helps everyone to realize
that you dont have to
find out youre dying
to start living
vapour
by vancouver sleep clinic playing

guitar strumming
chattering
its a rainy day
you can just drive away
but its sunny outside
so we might as well stay
ill collect some shells
and ill move the sand
well build our little sandcastle
in a faroff land
no one gets hurt and no one dies
and your tears are scared
of leaving your eyes
so grab a shovel
and start digging deep
cause our little sandcastle
is all we can keep
in our little sandcastle
well have a swimming pool
a great big tower
and maybe a chicken coop
we can run around
playing tag in the yard
oh why does this place
have to be so far
well the east wing is done
and now for the west
we should build a few more rooms
for our friends and guests
when we finally finish
the north and the south
ill show you why i chose you
and why you are mine
cause your ears are like
the shells i found
they listen to my soul
your eyes reflect the water
and our little sandcastle seems real
i want to leave this world and go
to a place where
no one gets hurt and no one dies
and your tears are scared
of leaving your eyes
so grab the shovel
and start digging deep
cause our little sandcastle
is all we can keep
our little sandcastle
will probably never exist
but i like to dream
and build our lives in it
and im sorry
for never finishing our room
i didnt have enough time
to make it as beautiful as you
when i lay my head to rest tonight
ill be dreaming of
our little sandcastle life
where well never get hurt
and never die
and our eyes will refuse to let us cry
no one gets hurt and no one dies
and your tears are scared
of leaving your eyes
so grab a shovel
and start digging deep
cause our little sandcastle
is all we can keep
we got it
rob yeah you got it
