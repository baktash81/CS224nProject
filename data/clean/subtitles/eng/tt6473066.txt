the stillwater high topaz dance crew 
   whistling  clapping 
   song playing 
 zach  and while there s a lot

 zach chuckles 
you are painfully awkward 
shut up  sammy  hey 
you sang it for me  and it was awesome 
 scoffs  that s nice 
but you are my best friend 
so you are morally obligated
to say nice things to me 
everybody else out there

it was seriously nothing 
i was just bored 
not trying to be ed sheeran or anything 
 ed  who 
oh  is he that little redheaded fella 
  you re hopeless 
   laughs 
anyway  i m just glad
you re not trying to be ed or anyone else 
the world already has them 
what would be great is
if it had more of you  just saying 
i can clean my own room 
can i get that in writing 
 girl  hey  dork 
woo boo boop

 gasps  you re bald

oh  she  like   
she  like  messaged me or whatever 
just making sure that it was fine
that you guys hung out  i guess

today is the day
we craft your college essays 
yay   laughs 
now look  i m not trying
to put no pressure on you at all 
i m lying  it s a lot of pressure 
i mean  these essays can determine the
whole trajectory of your life   laughs 
and i ma help you with that 
mr  weaver s gonna help you write
some of the best essays in the state 
my classroom  nobody else gonna care
but us  but it ll be a big deal to me 
so i came up with three questions to help
you write the perfect college essay 
question number one  what
do you hope to accomplish in college 
what do you wanna do once you get there 
do you actually wanna go there to learn 
or do you wanna just go there
and play around 
beer pong  physics  think about that 
number two 
what special attributes do you have
that should qualify you for consideration 
why should a university accept you 
what do you have to offer 
and not even just to a university 
to the world 
what are your best attributes 
and finally  the last question 
and it comes from
one of my favorite poets  mary oliver 
what do you wanna do with your one 
wild and precious life 
mary oliver 
one of the greats to ever do it 
think about that 
you got one life to live 
what are you gonna do with it 
now get to it 
  and if my heart should somehow stop 
by james vincent mcmorrow playing 
 amy  zach  zach  zach  hey 
 chuckles 
um  is everything okay 
i m okay 
well  i m really sorry
about your emergency surgery 
i m sure that was  like  really scary 
it s just the zach sobiech i know
wouldn t leave a girl stranded at the park
and never talk to her again 
 school bell rings 
i m terminal 
you should    you should go 
you re gonna be late 
 exhales 
 knocking slowly 
zach 
honey  what are you   
baby  it s freezing 
i m gonna get you a blanket 
here 
what happened 
in mr  weaver s class  we were supposed
to write a    a college essay 
mm hmm 
i mean   
what s the point
of writing a college essay
when i m never even
going to make it to college 
what s the point of anything now 
hon  what you re facing   
knowing that your time is limited 
it is    scary 
and awful  and i hate it 
i ve been thinking lately that none of us
are really promised tomorrow 
we all just assume it s gonna be there 
maybe it s kinda like a painting 
when you re standing too close to it   
you can see dark bits 
and you can see light bits  but   
you don t really know what you re
looking at until you take a step back 
so maybe  as much as this sucks   
maybe this is some
kind of weird chance for you 
to forget about all the superficial stuff
that people waste their time on 
you get to decide what matters most now 
you get to choose
what your painting s gonna look like

catherine latapie was the first person
to be miraculously cured at lourdes 
she was healed of paralysis in 1858 
physical miracles
are an extraordinary phenomenon 
but many other pilgrims
make their way to lourdes
for moral healing or spiritual comfort 
less spectacular miracles  perhaps 
but nevertheless 
important for those catholics   
 rob sighs  groans 
what s that 
oh  it s   
  where were you 
  work  just trying to catch up 
what are you watching 
i was thinking our family
could really use a vacation 
vacation  now 
when else 
zach s always wanted to see the world 
there s   
there s a place in france  lourdes 
people say the water
can be really healing 
  that it s been curing people   
  water  really 
he had 24 rounds of chemo 
yeah  i think i know how many rounds
of chemo he s had 
well  then you know how much
disappointment he s already had 
  and taking him and dragging him   
  we ve all been disappointed 
that doesn t mean
we just give up on our son 
 whispering 
i m not giving up on our son  okay 
i just wanna save him from this crazy idea
that a miracle could
all of a sudden happen
just  cause we went
across the fricking ocean for it 
we need this 
   alli  mom  i can t find my headphones 
   rob  okay  troops  let s hit the road 
   laura  they re on the couch 
  bring on the quality family time 
yeah  i think sam s only interested
in quality time with the moulin rouge 
dude  that was supposed to be a secret 
you re kidding  right 
  so does that mean we can t go  or   
  come on  grace 
are you sure we can t take daisy 
honey  i promise the schimnowskis
will take good care of her 
i just feel bad that we re going
to be having fun without her 
geez  grace  daisy can have more fun
shredding a roll of toilet paper
than anyone s ever had in france 
hey  you leaving without saying bye 
amy  what  uh  hi 
hey  zach  your hair looks good 
thank you 
yeah  it s surprising how fast it grows
when chemicals aren t being pumped
into your body 
here s the thing  i like you 
and i know your diagnosis
complicates things  but i can t help it 
i don t care  so  um   
  amy  i don t think   
  do you like me 
  yes  i do  but   
  even though i don t have cancer 
  come on  zeke 
  make your move  romeo 
  be nice 
  sam 
maybe we should just kiss 
give the people what they want 
oh  no  the people do not want that 
how did you even hear that 
how about you just text me
when you get there 
or i could just put you in my suitcase 
you can come with us 
  that is tempting

 chuckles 
you might wanna purify those thoughts
before we get to lourdes 
i think she s staring at me 
 laughs  it s like a catholic theme park 
 sighs 
it really sucks what s happening to you 
yeah 
sometimes i wonder
why it s happening to me 
like  out of all the people in the world 
what did i do 
  did i piss off god somehow 
  i don t think it works like that 
bad stuff happens
to good people all the time 
  well  tomorrow s gonna be weird 
  this whole thing is weird  man 
 zach  she s still staring at me 
i m surprised that
i haven t burst into flames yet 
 both laugh 
 zach  the night is young 
  a lot of people here 
  there are 
you think they change out the water
in between sessions 
they don t change out the communion wine
during cold season  so i doubt it 
 chuckles 
zach  if something happens in there
or if something doesn t   
it s okay  i know 
 laura  careful  it s slippery here 
thank you 
oh 
ooh  that s cold

bonjour 
sorry  just one second 
i need to finish this thought 
so nice to be missed 
  know myself  
okay  hello 
shut the front door 
are you writing a song 
um  kind of  the beginning of a song 
it s just lyrics right now  but yeah 
what are you doing 
i m waiting for you to perform your song 
  it s not quite ready 
  what s it called 
 coffee cup  
  interesting 
  all right 
i ll play you it  but please bear in mind
that it s in a workshop stage 
um   
 strums guitar 
okay 
  so    s     
  so i put on my helmet
and i strap on my boots  
  the rest of it is uphill
and i know that i may lose  
  but there s no chance of gaining
if i never even try  
  i would like to know myself  
  before i have to die  
that s all i have for now 
wow 
are you crying 
no  no  you are 
dude  what happened in france 
yeah  i don t know  i don t know 
i guess i just feel like
there s this music in me   
and it wants to come out 
  yeah  i know that feeling 
  so  you ll help 
with what 
writing more songs 
look  i know we ve played
other people s music before 
but i was thinking it might be cool
if we did something that was just ours 
zachary david sobiech 
i ve only waited eight years
for you to ask me that question 
oh  okay  yes  calm down 
it s not that serious 
it s not like i m asking you
to prom or anything 
well  good   cause i don t wanna
limit my options too soon 
you never know  tom hanks might walk
right through that door in a white tux
looking for someone to eat baby corn with 
just how many times
have you watched big now 
still not enough 
anyway  amy told me that she was hoping
that you would ask her to prom 
  crap 
  what  i thought you liked her 
yeah  i do  but prom proposals
are such a huge deal 
first of all 
it s called a promposal  okay 
second of all 
if you ask her  she s gonna say yes 
i just want it to be memorable 
jason mraz 
what about him 
well  i might ve gotten tickets
to his show at the metro 
  but  like  maybe   
  what are you talking about 
maybe instead of taking me 
you take amy and ask her to prom there 
  well  can t we get an extra ticket 
  for who 
for you  dummy 
there s no way i m going
to see jason mraz without you 
that s just not gonna happen 
i don t think you want a third wheel
around for your big promposal 
stop saying that word  they are
two separate words  prom and proposal 
and you re not a wheel 
you re like a wing 
  and amy s becoming like my other wing 
  ew 
if you say you need both of us to fly 
i m gonna barf on your blanket 
  together we will soar through the skies 
  i m barfing 
   retching 
   squawking

  mom  i m sorry   
  have you looked on youtube 
  what 
  look at that  look at it 
  you have 20 000 views 
  no way 
  seriously  for    for what 
  sammy    sammy posted our video 
i just talked to a journalist
who said she saw your video
  and she wants to interview you 
  why 
must be a slow news day 
  shut up 
   both laugh 
does she know about the cancer 
she d like to make it part of the story 
which we can talk about 
 zach  i dunno  i just   
i don t wanna be some kind of sob story 
 sammy  nobody sees you like that 
and if they did  i would tell you 
yeah  but if this interview does happen
that is what people will think 
if you don t wanna do the interview 
you don t really have to 
without doing anything 
the video s already up to   
  holy toledo 
  how much 
fifty one thousand 
are you serious  what are people saying 
 they harmonize so well together 
more songs please  are they dating  
that was timely 
the internet s so weird sometimes 
  what does that one say 
  that one doesn t say anything 
  show me 
  no  it s    it s kind of a dumb one 
 you re not so special 
lots of kids have cancer  
yeah  that guy s obviously
a very sad  lonely jerk 
but you don t know that  he could be
a very happy and popular jerk 
like that guy from grease 
  you re not so special
lots of kids have cancer  
 scatting 
you don t always have to do that 
do what 
you know  try to make something funny
when it s not 
no  tough crowd 
zach 
how s this for not funny  he s right 
  there s nothing special about me 
  that s not true  you should be happy 
  this is a good thing 
  why  because we have 51 000 views 
  who cares 
  because this is just the beginning 
and what s the end 
i thought this is what you wanted 
what i wanted was to make an album 
and then go on tour and then write
more songs and make another album 
but it doesn t really matter what i want 
because it s not gonna happen  is it 
is this what you wanted 
i mean  come on 
what i want is to not have
to lose my best friend 
 exhales

 exhales 
 sammy crying

do you wanna talk about it 
 distant chattering 
 exhales

if i ve said this to you  but you   
you look amazing
with this head full of hair 
like  for real  you look like a model 
 laughing 
even though i miss you
without eyebrows  though 
there s something
about you just having an alien face 
you know  no eyebrows 
nobody could see your expressions 
they don t know if you re surprised 
or   is he happy  
  do we know if   
  it s a pretty good poker face  right 
it s a great poker face 
you should play in a bunch of
poker tournaments  without eyebrows 
they should do a poker tournament
where everybody don t have no eyebrows 
  that would be crazy 
   chuckles 
that would be the longest game
of poker ever   laughs 
i m off chemo 
is it because it worked  or   
or 
you said  or   right 
or 
you know you don t have
to keep coming here  right 
um

to school and being around all of this 
you want me to quit 
 exhales

and for a long time 
i thought that i d be remembered
as a kid who went down fighting 
 labored breathing continues 
but now  sitting here 
looking at all of you   
i know i m gonna be remembered
as the kid who went up fighting   
and didn t really lose 
 cheering  applause 
zach  zach  zach 
 all  zach  zach  zach 
 chanting continues 
 cheering 
this is a song called  clouds  
 music starts 
  i fell down  down  down
into this dark and lonely hole  
  there was no one there
to care about me anymore  
  and i needed a way
to climb and grab a hold of the edge  
  you were sitting there holding a rope  
  and we ll go up  up  up
but i ll fly a little higher  
  go up in the clouds
because the view s a little nicer  
  up here  my dear
it won t be long now  
  it won t be long now  
  when we get back on land
well  i ll    get my chance  
 labored breathing 
  be ready to live
and it    my hands  
  and maybe someday
we ll take a little ride  
  go up  
 labored breathing 
 sammy    everything will be just fine  
  and we ll go up  up  up
but i ll fly a little higher  
  go up in the clouds
because the view s a little     
zach 
 hyperventilating 
 girl in audience 
  if only i had a little bit more time  
 audience 
  if only  
  i had a little bit more time with you  
  we could go up  up  up
then take that little ride  
  we ll sit there holding hands
and everything will be just right  
  and maybe someday  
  i ll see you again  
  we ll float up in the clouds
and we ll never see the end  
  we ll go up  up  up
but i ll fly a little higher  
  go up in the clouds
because the view s a little nicer  
  up here  my dear  
  it won t be long now  
  it won t be long now  
 bagpipes playing  amazing grace  
 sighs 
 zach s voice  wanna know a little secret 
most teenagers out there
feel like they re invincible 
not the superman kind of invincible 
the kind of invincible
that tricks you into thinking tomorrow
might be a better day
to start chasing your dreams 
now  look  i know it probably seems weird
for me to write a college essay
when  most likely  i won t make it there 
but i wasn t about to let a little thing
like cancer earn me my first f 
so  if by some miracle
i get the chance to go to college 
i will coax every ounce
of experience i can out of it 
but if i don t  that s okay too 
 mouths  rob 
because i plan to get as far as i can
with my limited time 
see  we all have limited time 
so  what is it i plan to do
with my one wild and precious life 
it s really simple  actually 
i just wanna make people happy 
as much as i can  for as long as i can 
and in the end  i hope my story
helps everyone to realize   
that you don t have to
find out you re dying   
to start living 
  vapour 
by vancouver sleep clinic playing 
oh  that went really far 
think of your enemies  sammy  go 
 laughs

 man  all right  one  two  three 
 camera clicks

  thank you so much  have a good one 
   man  yeah  you too 
  whoa  they re hyper today 
wait  sam  look at this  do you see that 
  what  i look bad 
   chuckles  no 
that s a  z   right 
yeah  that s a  z  
 both laugh 
 guitar strumming 
 chattering 
  it s a rainy day
you can just drive away  
  but it s sunny outside
so we might as well stay  
  i ll collect some shells  
  and i ll move the sand  
  we ll build our little sandcastle
in a far off land  
  no one gets hurt and no one dies  
  and your tears are scared
of leaving your eyes  
  so grab a shovel
and start digging deep  
  cause our little sandcastle
is all we can keep  
  in our little sandcastle
we ll have a swimming pool  
  a great big tower
and maybe a chicken coop  
  we can run around
playing tag in the yard  
  oh  why does this place
have to be so far   
  well  the east wing is done
and now for the west  
  we should build a few more rooms
for our friends and guests  
  when we finally finish
the north and the south  
  i ll show you why i chose you
and why you are mine  
   cause your ears are like
the shells i found  
  they listen to my soul  
  your eyes reflect the water  
  and our little sandcastle seems real  
  i want to leave this world and go  
  to a place where  
  no one gets hurt and no one dies  
  and your tears are scared
of leaving your eyes  
  so grab the shovel
and start digging deep  
   cause our little sandcastle
is all we can keep  
  our little sandcastle
will probably never exist  
  but i like to dream
and build our lives in it  
  and i m sorry
for never finishing our room  
  i didn t have enough time
to make it as beautiful as you  
  when i lay my head to rest tonight  
  i ll be dreaming of
our little sandcastle life  
  where we ll never get hurt
and never die  
  and our eyes will refuse to let us cry  
  no one gets hurt and no one dies  
  and your tears are scared
of leaving your eyes  
  so grab a shovel
and start digging deep  
   cause our little sandcastle
is all we can keep  
  we got it 
   rob  yeah  you got it
