mr thomas mr rogers
pull the curtains aside
hes english he is 21 years of age
his name is john merrick
in the course
of my profession i have come upon
many deformities of the face
due to injury or disease
as well as mutilations and contortions
of the body from like causes
i have never seen such a perverted
degraded version of a human being
i wish to draw your attention to
his insidious conditions
can you see over there
note if you will
the extreme enlargement of the skull
and the limb which is useless
the alarming curvature of the spine
would you turn round please
turn round please
the looseness of the skin
and the fibrous tumours
that cover 90 of the body
there is every indication that these
afflictions have existed and have
progressed rapidly since birth
he suffers from chronic bronchitis
interesting side note
despite these anomalies
the patients genitals
remain entirely intact and unaffected
thank you
and his left arm
is perfectly normal as you see
so gentlemen
owing to the
congenital extostoses of the skull
extensive papillomatous growths
pendulous masses of skin
the enlargement of
the right limb and all the bones
the distortion of the head
and the extensive area
covered by papillomatous growth
the patient
has been called the elephant man
thank you
you havent
mentioned his mental state
hes an imbecile probably from birth
a complete idiot
pray to god he is
where have you been
out
how can i eat with a noise like that
bytes dont
where were you what did you do
our man is sick come right away
what is it
like this
what did you do with him
hes been like this all night
he was fine when he left here
now look at him
yes i intend to
what happened
he had a fall he falls
looks like a very severe fall
hes a
clumsy soul
never looks where hes going
but thats alright
he has me to take care of him
why is he sitting up he needs rest
thats how he sleeps
if he lies down hell kill himself
his heads too big
this man belongs in the hospital
cant you treat him here
listen hes my livelihood
were business partners he and l
hes the greatest freak in the world
now you listen
youre not going to have a livelihood
if he dies go and fetch a cab
i truly appreciate this my friend
listen
theres much i can do for you
i move in the proper circles
in fact anything at all
if you take my meaning
everything will be taken care of
good to do business with you
can i have a bowl of oatmeal
breakfasting with the patients
its for a patient
there you are
thank you good morning
morning
come here a moment
whats that youve got there
good heavens you havent acquired
a taste for this stuff
yes its quite nutricious
possibly
not quite the diet for
a grown man nurse
just take this to the patient
in the isolation ward will you
yes sir
dont be frightened
he wont hurt you
wont he indeed just a moment
theres something i want to say
a hospitals no place for secrecy
doctors spiriting hooded figures
around cause comment
why wasnt he properly admitted
why the isolation ward
hes not contagious is he
no hes got chronic bronchitis
and hes been beaten
why not the general ward then
hes seriously deformed
i fear it could shock the patients
deformed is that it
ls he ultimately incurable
yes sir
but you must be aware
that this hospital
doesnt accept incurables
im aware of that
but this case is quite exceptional
i quite appreciate your problem
why not contact
the royal hospital for lncurables
perhaps they might find him a place
yes would you like to meet him
excuse me
the elephant man
sorry
sorry
i should have warned you
please forgive me you alright
please send mrs mothershead up here
tell her to knock and wait for me
im sorry about that
well bring you another breakfast
you must be very hungry
youll be comfortable here
ill see you get everything you need
blimey
so this is the elephant man
i aint seen nothing like you before
what the hell happened to you
dumb eh
i like people that can keep quiet
here have a drink
go on no
you should be more sociable
get yourself disliked
were going to be good friends and my
friends will want to meet you
and they will believe me
ive brought your breakfast
what are you doing down there
come up on the bed
come on
all he understands is a good smack
hes had his share of smacks
that drives him under the bed
treat him with kindness and patience
perhaps youve
got time for that sort of treatment
ive got a hospital to run
dont you waste your time with him
its like talking to a brick wall
i dont mean to be harsh
but he doesnt belong here
honestly sir
what can you do for him
by the way mr carrgomm said
hed like to see you
when you can spare a moment
yes
thank you
i cant help you unless you help me
i believe theres something
you want to say to me

and now hes leaving with me
do you understand me
now mr treves
we made a deal
you misunderstood
this man has suffered a severe fall
if you take my meaning
he is my patient now
pull the other one
im sorry but all you do is profit
from another mans misery
do you think you are better than me
no
you wanted the freak
to show your doctor chums
make a name for yourself
you my friend
i gave you the freak on trust
in the name of science
and now i want him back
you do not own this man stop it
i want him back
so you can beat him
so you can starve him
a dog in the street would fare better
ill go to the authorities
go to them then
by all means
theyll be interested
to hear your story and ours
now i think
we really understand one another
alright
alright
a singularly unattractive character
it seems to me i might
as well meet this patient of yours

please forgive me
can you imagine the life he must
have had  yes i think i can
i dont believe so
i dont believe any of us can
terrible though his appearance is
so terrible that nervous persons
fly in horror from the sight of him
and that he is debarred from
earning his livelihood in any way
yet he is superior in intelligence
he can read and write
is quiet gentle
not to say even refined
i should like to meet this gentleman
have you seen this
no
listen to this
hey up hey up
hey up
listen this is a letter
to the london times
from the governor of the hospital
in a little room in one of attic wards
is a man named john merrick
so dreadful a sight that he is
unable even to come out by day
hes been called the elephant man
on account of his terrible deformity
his appearance is so terrible
that women and nervous persons
fly in terror at the sight of him
and how do you get tickets to see him
your very own sunny jim
lets go and see him
keep your shirt on
the time must be right
now hes in the attic but tomorrow
theyll move him to bedstead square
right into my lap
