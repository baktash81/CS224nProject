thank you  good afternoon 
mr  thomas  mr  rogers 
pull the curtains aside 
he s english  he is 21 years of age 
his name is john merrick 
in the course
of my profession i have come upon
many deformities of the face
due to injury or disease
as well as mutilations and contortions
of the body from like causes 
i have never seen such a perverted 
degraded version of a human being 
i wish to draw your attention to
his insidious conditions 
can you see over there 
note  if you will 
the extreme enlargement of the skull
and the limb  which is useless 
the alarming curvature of the spine 
would you turn round  please 
turn round  please 
the looseness of the skin
and the fibrous tumours
that cover 90  of the body 
there is every indication that these
afflictions have existed and have
progressed rapidly since birth 
he suffers from chronic bronchitis 
interesting side note 
despite these anomalies
the patient s genitals
remain entirely intact and unaffected 
thank you 
and his left arm
is perfectly normal  as you see 
so gentlemen 
owing to the
congenital extostoses of the skull 
extensive papillomatous growths 
pendulous masses of skin 
the enlargement of
the right limb and all the bones 
the distortion of the head
and the extensive area
covered by papillomatous growth 
the patient
has been called the  elephant man  
thank you 
you haven t
mentioned his mental state 
he s an imbecile  probably from birth 
a complete idiot 
pray to god he is 
where have you been 
out 
how can i eat with a noise like that 
bytes  don t 
where were you  what did you do 
our man is sick  come right away 
  what is it 
like this   
what did you do with him 
he s been like this all night 
he was fine when he left here 
now look at him 
yes  i intend to 
what happened 
  he had a fall  he falls 
looks like a very severe fall 
he s a   
    clumsy soul 
never looks where he s going 
but that s alright 
he has me to take care of him 
why is he sitting up  he needs rest 
that s how he sleeps 
if he lies down  he ll kill himself 
his head s too big 
this man belongs in the hospital 
can t you treat him here 
listen  he s my livelihood 
we re business partners  he and l 
he s the greatest freak in the world 
  now  you listen 
you re not going to have a livelihood
if he dies  go and fetch a cab 
i truly appreciate this  my friend 
listen 
there s much i can do for you 
i move in the proper circles 
in fact  anything at all 
if you take my meaning 
everything will be taken care of 
  good to do business with you 
can i have a bowl of oatmeal 
breakfasting with the patients 
  it s for a patient 
there you are 
thank you  good morning 
  morning 
come here a moment 
what s that you ve got there 
good heavens  you haven t acquired
a taste for this stuff 
yes  it s quite nutricious 
  possibly 
not quite the diet for
a grown man  nurse 
just take this to the patient
in the isolation ward  will you 
yes  sir 
don t be frightened 
he won t hurt you 
won t he indeed  just a moment 
there s something i want to say 
a hospital s no place for secrecy 
doctors spiriting hooded figures
around cause comment 
why wasn t he properly admitted 
why the isolation ward 
he s not contagious  is he 
  no  he s got chronic bronchitis 
and he s been beaten 
  why not the general ward then 
he s seriously deformed 
i fear it could shock the patients 
deformed  is that it 
ls he ultimately incurable 
yes  sir 
  but you must be aware 
that this hospital
doesn t accept incurables 
i m aware of that 
but this case is quite exceptional 
i quite appreciate your problem 
why not contact
the royal hospital for lncurables 
perhaps they might find him a place 
  yes  would you like to meet him 
excuse me 
the elephant man 
sorry 
sorry 
i should have warned you 
please forgive me  you alright 
please send mrs  mothershead up here 
tell her to knock and wait for me 
i m sorry about that 
we ll bring you another breakfast 
you must be very hungry 
you ll be comfortable here 
i ll see you get everything you need 
blimey 
so  this is the elephant man 
i ain t seen nothing like you before 
what the hell happened to you 
dumb  eh 
i like people that can keep quiet 
here  have a drink 
go on  no 
you should be more sociable 
get yourself disliked 
we re going to be good friends and my
friends will want to meet you 
and they will  believe me 
i ve brought your breakfast 
what are you doing down there 
come up on the bed 
come on 
all he understands is a good smack 
  he s had his share of smacks 
that drives him under the bed 
treat him with kindness and patience 
perhaps you ve
got time for that sort of treatment 
i ve got a hospital to run 
don t you waste your time  with him 
it s like talking to a brick wall 
i don t mean to be harsh 
but he doesn t belong here 
honestly  sir 
what can you do for him 
by the way  mr  carr gomm said
he d like to see you
when you can spare a moment 
yes 
  thank you 
i can t help you  unless you help me 
i believe there s something
you want to say to me 
something back there 
i can t help you  unless you help me 
i believe you want to say something 
i ve got to understand
what you re feeling and thinking 
do you understand me 
just nod your head 
can you understand me 
nod your head if you understand me 
alright 
you do understand 
i want to hear you talk 
you are not a wall 
do you understand 
i want you to talk to me 
now  i want to hear you say it 
i want to hear how you say things 
i m not going to hurt you 
got to hear 
very slowly  i want you to say  yes  
say  yes  
yes 
yes 
alright 
now just once more   yes  
i can understand that  that s good 
that s very good  alright now
i m going to say some words to you

  just a moment 
never mind  i want my man 
he s still very sick 
come downstairs and i ll explain 
no 
don t 
you ve had plenty of time to cure him 
and now he s leaving with me 
do you understand me 
now  mr  treves 
we made a deal 
  you misunderstood 
this man has suffered a severe fall 
if you take my meaning 
he is my patient now 
  pull the other one 
i m sorry  but all you do is profit
from another man s misery 
do you think you are better than me 
  no 
you wanted the freak
to show your doctor chums 
make a name for yourself 
you  my friend   
i gave you the freak    on trust 
in the name of science 
and now i want him back 
  you do not own this man  stop it 
i want him back 
  so you can beat him 
so you can starve him 
a dog in the street would fare better 
i ll go to the authorities 
  go to them  then 
by all means 
they ll be interested
to hear your story and ours 
now  i think
we really understand one another 
alright 
alright 
a singularly unattractive character 
it seems to me i might
as well meet this patient of yours 
thank you very much 
shall we say in a few days 
two o clock tomorrow afternoon 
whatever s most convenient  sir 
two o clock then  tomorrow 
thank you very much

he leadeth me into paths of   
righteousness for his name s sake  
 righteousness  
 he leadeth me into the paths of
righteousness for his name s sake

because of the constrictive deformity 
but he can talk

impression  that he might be nervous

good day 
it was very good  john 
i ll be back in a moment 
 the lord is my shepherd 
i shall not want 
he maketh me lie down    
a brave attempt but he simply
mouthed words taught by you 
i m sorry to have wasted your time 
 he retoreth my soul  
he simply doesn t belong here 
he should be constantly looked after 
i m sorry  things have
turned out this way  good day 
yes 
 though i walked through the valley of
the shadow of death  i fear no
evil  for thou art with me 
thy rod and thy staff    
mr  carr gomm 
what is it 
it s that 
i didn t teach him that part 
 goodness and mercy
will follow me all the days of my life
and i shall dwell
in the house of the lord forever  
how did you know the rest of it 
  very strange 
how did you know
the rest of the 23rd psalm 
i used to read the bible every day 
i know it very well
and the book of common prayer 
the 23rd psalm s beautiful 
it s my favourite 
come and see me in my office
when you re through

important i want to say 
goodbye 
i do hope we shall meet again 
why didn t you tell me you can read 
i was frightened

  i was afraid to talk 
please forgive me 
can you imagine the life he must
have had    yes  i think i can 
i don t believe so 
i don t believe any of us can 
terrible though his appearance is 
so terrible  that nervous persons
fly in horror from the sight of him 
and that he is debarred from
earning his livelihood in any way 
yet he is superior in intelligence 
he can read and write 
is quiet  gentle 
not to say even refined 
i should like to meet this gentleman

unable even to come out by day
