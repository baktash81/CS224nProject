two years in september  we
used to live in new york 
city 
yeah  i was a writer

yeah  should i be concerned 
i remember these 
i loved these books 
wait a minute 
your wife is amazing amy 
yeah  she is 
wow 
amazing fucking amy is
getting fucking married 
that s how the night started 
with me  regular 
flawed  real amy 
jealous  as always 
of the golden child 
perfect  brilliant  amazing amy 
who s getting fucking married 
when i was 10  i quit cello 
in the next book  amazing
amy became a prodigy 
did you play volleyball 
i got cut  freshman year 
she made varsity 
when did you have a dog 
she got the dog 
puddles made her more relatable 
wow 
i love your parents   
but they really can be assholes 
nick  sir 
hey  thanks for coming  man 
no problem 
hey  sweetheart 
big night for your mom 
it would mean so much if you
would talk to a few reporters   
bloggers  give them
a little amy color 
people wanna hear from you 
we can t stay long  fantastic 
fifteen minutes  tops 
this is why i have
my brownstone 
my trust fund  i know
i can t complain 
your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood 
no  they improved upon it   
and then peddled
it to the masses 
i thought you were gonna wear
white to match the wedding theme 
i thought that would be creepy 
 if it s worth doing 
it s worth doing    
hold up  i know how this ends 
don t tell me 
you re very cute  nick 
amy  you know what would
make dad s night 
oh  i m on it 
i love having strangers
pick at my scabs 
i m
curious whether   
it s difficult for you to see
amazing amy heading down the aisle 
and this big party celebrating
this fictional wedding 
because it s my understanding
you are not married 
is that correct 
correct 
amazing amy has always
been one step ahead of me 
excuse me  i m sorry  i
just have a few questions 
it s you 
i m here in a strictly
journalistic capacity 
now  you had the
distinct pleasure   
of dating nick dunne
for how long 
two magical years 
in the course of that time 
you ve had the opportunity   
to perform such
gracious gestures as   
not correcting nick when he
pronounced  quinoa  as  kween o a  
an understandable mistake 
he also thought it was a fish 
he thinks velveeta is a cheese 
you also manage to appear
shocked and delighted   
when nick s elderly mother breaks
into an impromptu rendition   
of new york  new york 
every time she sees you 
these
bag of bone shoes
that s just frightening 
you also bought nick his
very first pair of scissors 
and matching stapler 
amy elliott  you are
more than amazing 
you are brilliant  yet
entirely un snobby 
you challenge me 
you surprise me 
and  fun fact for the readers   
you have a world class vagina 
my colleagues tell me that
you are not yet married 
is that correct 
i m not 
isn t it time we fixed that 
and then   
the night wasn t so bad anymore 
and it s done  crossed
off the list 
now  normally  we would
not treat this   
as a missing persons
case so quick   
but given the scene
at your house   
and given our spike in
violent crime of late   
we are gonna take this
very  very seriously 
okay  good 
we ve got forensics
over at your place 
you got somewhere to stay 
i could stay at my sister s 
okay 
we re tracking amy s
phone  her credit cards 
we will organize
searches  put up flyers 
we re gonna hold a press
conference tomorrow 
you re having a
press conference 
i wanna get the word out  right 
yeah  it s just all
of a sudden   
i feel like i m on a
law   order episode 
time is of the essence
in these cases 
but  that said  do you wanna
wait and call a lawyer 
absolutely not  i
just wanna help 
so  you and amy have
been here two years 
you tend bar    i own the bar 
and i teach creative
writing at mvcc 
no kids  not yet 
so  what does amy do most days 
a woman with all those
degrees  what does she do 
i don t know  she keeps busy 
doing what 
she s a voracious reader 
so  she s always got
a book in her hand 
well  days can get long 
i know a few housewives  that evening
glass of wine starts coming at noon 
or prescription pills 
just last week 
we had a soccer mom 
nice lady  got her teeth
kicked in over some oxycontin 
ever since that mall went bust 
half the town is out of work 
we cannot keep up with
the drug violence 
i m pretty sure that s not it 
has amy got friends
we can talk to 
um   
no  not really 
no friends  this whole town 
she was very close with my
mom  before she passed away 
you know  we have a pretty
serious homeless problem   
in our neighborhood 
i think maybe you guys
should check that out 
we ll look into that 
you got to the bar
around 11 00 today 
where were you before that 
just to cross that out 
well  i was home 
i left at 9 30  i got a cup
of coffee  a newspaper 
i went to sawyer beach
and read the news 
did you visit with anyone there 
i kind of go to sawyer
beach for the solitude 
so  your wife has
no friends here 
is she kinda standoffish 
ivy league  rubs
people the wrong way 
she s from new york  oh 
she s complicated  she s
got very high standards 
type a 
that can make you crazy
if you re not like that 
you seem pretty laid back 
type b 
speaking of which 
amy s blood type 
god  i don t know  i d have
to look it up at the house 
you don t know if
she has friends   
you don t know what
she does all day   
and you don t know your
wife s blood type 
sure you all are married 
uh    maybe it s type o 
where are her folks 
new york  yeah

that would happen to amy 
she always attracts   
drama 
you can say it  it s

projecting their shit on me

strange  new sentence

mama maureen   
stage 4 breast cancer 
so  we moved to missouri 
i don t mind 
i just wish he d asked 
nick is happy to be home 
but i don t know if he s
happy i m with him 
i feel like something
he loaded by mistake 
something to be
jettisoned  if necessary 
something disposable 
i feel like i could disappear 
oh  my god

she just vanished 
she s just gone 
i ve been so worried about you 
where have you been

my sister s
asleep in the other room 
i needed to see you 
i know this is a bad idea 
can you at least
tell me you love me 
i do love you  but we have to
be really careful right now 
oh  i ve been so scared 
between rehearsals 
you told me i needed
to have my own life 
i know 
we need to stop 
i need you 
touch me

disposable phone

pair of red panties in my office

real quick  but
then you have to go 
my husband has come undone 
we moved to missouri
to save maureen   
but as it turns
out  we couldn t 
it means a lot that you came 
we took a hit
on the brownstone   
and i used the last of my
trust fund to buy him a bar 
so far  it s just costing money 
nick uses me for sex when he wants 
otherwise  i don t exist  whoo 
we should go to outback tonight 
that would be nice 
last night  i went
from desperate to pathetic 
i became someone i
don t even like 
the kind of woman
i used to mock 
you re out so much 
i know  stay home 
i can t  i m already late 
then  can i come 
you would hate it 
it s a bunch of my dorky
high school friends 
do our code  no bullshit 
i thought we weren t
gonna be that couple 
okay  bye 
hey  i ve been thinking  yeah 
something positive 
maybe it s time 
now is literally the worst time 
it would be a new start for us 
and for me  i would have
a real purpose here 
a child is not a hobby 
not a hobby 
an inspiration 
we could have had this fight
four hours ago  i m late 
i didn t know it was
gonna be a fight 
you really wanna be the
couple that has a baby   
to save their marriage 
 save  
reboot  retool 
rekindle  whatever 
and you re gonna walk
out the door now  yeah 
you re a fucking coward 
no  it can t go on like this 
oh  really 
i won t  you won t 
you won t  why  it s not
good enough for you 
it s not even close 
you stupid bitch 
what scared me wasn t
that he d pushed me 
what scared me was how much
he wanted to hurt me more 
what scared me was that
i d finally realized   
i am frightened of
my own husband 
you want me to call for backup 
nah  i ll protect you 
jesus 
they ought to burn
this place down 
seems like
folks are trying 
you really think
this is anything 
cross it off the list 
hey  jason 
what s up  rhonda 
    and dedicated to the
proposition that all men    
have you seen this
girl around here 
why do you ask 
she was reported missing 
    and so dedicated 
can long endure  
yeah  i remember her 
what did she want  weed  pills 
she wanted a gun 
i told her it s not my thing 
i felt bad  though  she
seemed really desperate 
she said it needed
to be small   
so she could keep it close 
are you sure this is her 
you don t forget a girl
like that in here 
she was all in pink 
it was valentine s day 
for valentine s day 
i thought i d buy a gun 
that is how crazy i ve become 
nick wants me gone but he
won t ask for a divorce 
in his mind  i m the owner of his
bar  his only line of credit 
the bitch with the prenup 
i could go home to my parents   
but i d have to tell
them the truth 
and i don t even know if i believe
the truth 
can i really think
nick would hurt me 
i m being paranoid  crazy 
it s just   
i d sleep better with a gun 
oh  shit 
wake up  baby  my
sister s gonna come out here 
sorry to rush you  it s okay 
here  let me help you  okay 
just get that 
be very careful 
i m all right 
here you go

okay 
you fucking idiot 
you fucking asshole  you fucking
lied to my fucking face 
i m sorry 
how old is she 
she s in her early 20s 
how long 
a year and a half 
you lied to me for over a year 
oh  if i told you  you
would have made me stop 
it s so fucking small 
you re a liar and a cheat 
you re just like dad 
how did you even meet her 
she s one of my students 
i thought writers hated cliches 
oh  i m not a writer 
 oh  boo hoo  i got laid off  i
guess i ll fuck a teenager  
it wasn t like that  okay  you have
no idea how shitty it was with amy   
how fucking terrible
she made me feel 
flyover boy  i would get
knots in my stomach   
just coming home  knowing she
would be sitting there   
dissatisfied  before i even
walked in the fucking door 
this is so bad 
if anybody finds out 
you re totally fucked 
boney found a pair of
panties in my office   
where  occasionally 
andie and i   
i don t know what
the fuck it means 
are they super twat s 
her name is andie 
she s not entirely sure 
so we are dealing
with a 20 year old   
who isn t sure where
she leaves her undies 
if they re not andie s  that
means that they re amy s   
and she left them
there for me to find 
nick  i was scared
for you before   
and now  i m fucking petrified 
we re having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife   
and this morning  you re kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye 
can you imagine 
have you watched
television lately 
cable news is all
over your shit 
i mean  what is wrong
with this barkeep 
his wife s nowhere
to be found   
and here s nick dunne
for you  flirting 
cute pic  huh 
who is that 
some fucking tragedy groupie 
who the fuck is that 
i don t know 
she was trying to
give me a casserole 
on the show today we have defense
attorney  tanner bolt   
patron saint to wife killers
everywhere 
tanner bolt  would you actually
consider defending nick dunne 
well  let me just say   
as always  ellen  thank you
for such a warm welcome 
but of course  i d
defend nick dunne 
listen  just because this guy
isn t walking around weeping   
that doesn t mean that
he s not hurting 
tanner  the hallmark of a
sociopath is a lack of empathy 
but the truth is  you d
have to be a sociopath   
to behave normally
in this situation   
because it s the most abnormal
situation in the world 
tanner  are you trying to
tell me that this photo   
is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior 
i m so sick of being
picked apart by women 
you need to hire tanner bolt 
i don t deserve this 
innocent until proven guilty 
that s exactly what you deserve 
go home  nick 
hey  buddy 
i can t believe we
haven t arrested this guy 
we re not gonna
arrest anybody   
just because some
blonde dunce says so 
why are you going so easy on him 
you got a crush 
one  l am conducting an
investigation  not a witch hunt 
and  two  don t talk
to me that way  ever 
she was trying to buy a gun 
we don t know who or what
was scaring her  gil 
give me the update 
no drug angles panned out yet 
so cross that off the list 
i talked to the nurses who
care for nick s father 
the guy s a bastard  but he s weak as
a kitten  so cross that off the list 
hey 
so  luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of july 
whoa  yeah 
the blood is profuse 
it is amy s  type b  and
we should have dna soon 
thoughts on a weapon 
trajectory
indicates blunt force 
maybe a club or a two by four 
she fell there  but i
doubt she got back up 
amy s medical records come in 
no  we ll have them
later tonight 
my wife says he s a killer 
well  if tiffany says   
hey 
hey 
thank you all for coming out 
hey donnie  how are you 
rich  thank you so much 
hey  hmm 
thank you  folks 
thank you for being
here tonight 
it just means the
world to our family 
and to amy 
as you all know   
my wife  amy elliott dunne   
disappeared three days ago 
and i want to implore anyone who
has any information at all   
please come forward  help us 
so hot  ew  he is so creepy 
i wanna say something   
because i think some of
you might be wondering   
and are too polite to ask 
i had nothing to do with the
disappearance of my wife 
i m cooperating with the police 
i haven t hired a lawyer 
i have nothing to hide 
amy is my soul mate 
she is brilliant   
she s charming  and wise 
i love you  amy 
asshole 
i love my wife   
so much 
and i may not behave for the
cameras the way they want me to   
and if they wanna punish
me for that  that s okay 
but i just wanna ask you in the
media  please  harass me   
but don t harass the people of this town 
if you need to mock
somebody  mock me 
nick 
but please don t turn this
investigation into a circus 
where s your wife  nick 
let the police do their jobs 
what did you do to
your pregnant wife 
did you tell
them that  nick 
did you tell them amy
was six weeks pregnant 
thank you for your support tonight 
let s find amy 
go ahead  if you guys
wanna say something 
gil  go  go 
nick  where
are you going 
stop him 
no questions right now 
thank you 
why are you running away 
don t run 
everybody  stay back 
guys  come on  you know better 
get off the grass  get
down to the curb 
on it 
all right 
all right  y all heard her 
no pictures 
hello 
hello 
fuck 
you scared me  want a drink 
did you know she was pregnant 
i told you  noelle hawthorne
is fucking crazy 
she doesn t even know amy 
they look like pretty
good friends to me 
look  i don t know 
but it certainly doesn t
prove that she s pregnant 
we have her medical
records coming 
good  so  let s
talk while we wait 
let s start over here 
the scene of the crime 
you see  we ve seen
dozens of home invasions 
dozens and dozens 
this area right here  it looked
wrong from the second we saw it 
the whole thing looked staged 
watch this 
and yet  they remained upright
throughout this life and death struggle 
i don t know  what do
you want me to say 
did you do any housekeeping the
day your wife went missing 
no  because our guys
did a luminol test 
and i m sorry to tell you 
but that kitchen lit up 
amy lost a lot of blood
in there  nick  a lot 
oh  my god 
yeah  and then
somebody mopped it up 
oh    wait a second  why would
they mop up the blood   
if they re trying to
stage a crime scene 
no blood and no body
suggests kidnapping 
it tells us  look at
people outside the house 
like these homeless
you keep mentioning 
a pool of blood and no
body suggests homicide 
it tells us to look at
people inside the house 
which is what we re
doing here  nick 
i see 
so  how was
your marriage  nick 
because right now  all
we got is noelle 
she says   not good  
gil  what do you and
your wife argue about 
what pisses you off  oh 
money  lack thereof 
me and my
ex  it s the same 
i mention that because we got a
look at your finances  nick 
 117 000 in credit card debt 
what  i pulled up some
of the merchandise 
there are these fun
little splurges 
i didn t buy
any of this stuff 
i don t even golf 
i do  you bought great clubs 
i like the robot dog 
this is identity theft 
this is a felony 
we need to find
out who did this 
all right  let s talk
about life insurance 
because in april  you bumped
up amy s life insurance   
to  1 2 million 
yes  i did  that was her idea 
she wanted me to 
you filed the paperwork 
because she told me to  whoa 
hold on a sec 
yeah  okay 
for sure 
all right 
she was pregnant 
this is insane 
so  my question becomes   
i don t want to talk
to you again  ever   
without a lawyer 
margo 
hey 
just hold on a second 
let me finish 
nick 
i hear you  i hear you 
i was as surprised as   
i know you re upset  i had
no idea she was pregnant 
listen  i thought so  too 
but evidently that wasn t   
you want to know the truth 
the truth is  amy
didn t want kids 
well  i m as surprised as   
you told me you
didn t want kids 
i was trying
to put a good face on 
then  suddenly  you ve
got a pregnant wife 
that s a problem for you 
especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend 
oh  stop watching ellen abbott 
you have to fucking talk to me 
i didn t tell you that
she didn t want kids   
because she didn t want me to 
because it would
have just been   
another reason for
you to hate her 
and we had enough of those already 
it was easier to just   
lie to me  i wanted kids 
when we first moved here  i
went to a fertility clinic 
it didn t work  i did my part 
masturbate  when it came time   
for amy to do her thing  all
of a sudden it was like   
 well  i don t know  maybe 
no  thanks  
now  who would believe you 
all right 
this is a letter
from the clinic   
notifying me that they re
gonna destroy my sample   
unless i contact them 
so  i gave it to amy 
the next day  i saw
it in the trash 
but you were already with
andie by then  right 
i wanted a baby with amy 
a year ago  amy
being pregnant   
would have been the
best thing ever 
 when your poor amy has a
cold  this dessert just    
this is the clue you
couldn t solve 
yeah 
a letter from desi 
that creepy boyfriend of amy s 
it was the fucking rich guy who
would do anything for her 
it just kept hanging over my head 
it was disgusting 
your prenup 
nick  why have you
kept this stuff 
it s like a little box of hate 
i don t know  go 
maybe i hate her 
i love you no matter what 
but you need to tell me 
tell you what 
what are you asking me 
are you asking me if i
killed my wife  go 
is that what you re asking me 
if i murdered my wife 
i would never ask you that 
margo 
don t walk on the glass 
oh 
you have no clue  do you 
why was he
here that night 
his wife is missing 
why come here 
who cares 
rhonda  we got this 
let s make the arrest 
do you know how hard it is to make
a murder case without a body 
no 
well  it s incredibly hard 
so  i want one last thing 
what s that 
i want a body 
picture me  i m a
girl who s very  very bad 
be careful 
i need to be punished  and
by  punished   i mean  had  
fuck 
it s where you keep
goodies for anniversary five 
so  open the door   
punish  wood  beach 
and look alive 
punish  wood 
wood 
i will practice believing
my husband loves me   
and will love this baby 
that this child might
really save our marriage 
but i could be wrong 
because sometimes   
the way he looks at me   
i think   
man of my dreams   
father of my child   
this man of mine may kill me 
he may truly   
kill me 
wtf 
i am so much happier
now that i m dead 
technically   missing  
soon to be presumed dead 
gone 
and my lazy  lying  cheating 
oblivious husband   
will go to prison for my murder 
nick dunne took my pride
and my dignity   
and my hope and my money 
he took and took from me
until i no longer existed 
that s murder 
let the punishment
fit the crime 
to fake a convincing murder 
you have to have discipline 
you befriend a local idiot 
harvest the details
of her humdrum life 
and cram her with stories about
your husband s violent temper 
secretly create some
money troubles 
credit cards  perhaps
online gambling 
with the help of
the unwitting   
bump up your life insurance 
purchase getaway car 
craigslist 
generic  cheap  pay cash 
you need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss 
and america loves
pregnant women 
as if it s so hard
to spread your legs 
you know what s hard 
faking a pregnancy 
first  drain your toilet 
invite pregnant idiot
into your home   
and ply her with lemonade 
steal pregnant idiot s urine 
voilà 
a pregnancy is now part of
your legal medical record 
happy anniversary 
wait for your
clueless husband   
to start his day 
off he goes 
and the clock is ticking 
meticulously stage
your crime scene   
with just enough mistakes to
raise the specter of doubt 
you need to bleed 
a lot 
a lot  a lot 
a head wound kind of bleed 
a crime scene kind of bleed 
you need to clean poorly   
like he would 
clean and bleed 
bleed and clean 
and leave a little
something behind 
a fire in july 
and because you re you   
you don t stop there 
you need a diary 
minimum  300 entries on
the nick and amy story 
start with the fairy
tale early days 
those are true  and
they re crucial 
you want nick and
amy to be likeable 
after that  you in vent 
the spending 
the abuse  the fear 
the threat of violence 
and nick thought
he was the writer 
burn it just the right amount 
make sure the cops will find it 
finally  honor tradition with
a very special treasure hunt 
and if i get everything right 
the world will hate nick   
for killing his
beautiful  pregnant wife 
and after all the outrage 
when i m ready   
i ll go out on the water
with a handful of pills   
and a pocket full of stones 
and when they find my
body  they ll know   
nick dunne dumped his
beloved like garbage 
and she floated down
past all the other   
abused  unwanted 
inconvenient women 
then  nick will die  too 
nick and amy will be gone 
but  then  we never
really existed 
nick loved a girl i
was pretending to be 
 cool girl  
men always use that as
their defining compliment 
 she s a cool girl  
cool girl is hot 
cool girl is game 
cool girl is fun 
cool girl never gets
angry at her man 
she only smiles in a
chagrined  loving manner   
and then presents her
mouth for fucking 
she likes what he likes 
so evidently  he s a vinyl
hipster who loves fetish manga 
if he likes girls gone
wild  she s a mall babe   
who talks football and endures
buffalo wings at hooters 
when i met nick dunne  i
knew he wanted cool girl 
and for him  i ll admit 
i was willing to try 
i wax stripped my pussy raw 
i drank canned beer watching
adam sandier movies 
i ate cold pizza and
remained a size two 
i blew him semi regularly 
i lived in the moment 
i was fucking game 
i can t say i didn t
enjoy some of it 
nick teased out of me things
i didn t know existed 
a lightness  a humor  an ease 
but i made him smarter  sharper 
i inspired him to
rise to my level 
i forged the man of my dreams 
we were happy pretending
to be other people 
we were the happiest
couple we knew 
and what s the point of being
together if you re not the happiest 
but nick got lazy 
he became someone i did
not agree to marry 
he actually expected me to
love him unconditionally 
then he dragged me  penniless  to
the navel of this great country   
and found himself a newer 
younger  bouncier   
cool girl 
you think i d let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever 
no fucking way 
he doesn t get to win 
my cute  charming 
salt of the earth  missouri guy 
he needed to learn 
grown ups work for things 
grown ups pay 
grown ups suffer consequences 
wait 
i need 20 seconds where you
don t judge me  interrupt me   
or get angry 
okay 
is that all the stuff
from the credit cards 
where do you store goodies
for anniversary five 
wood 
woodshed 
yeah  my woodshed 
that fucking bitch 
i thought    it s all right 
i would have  too 
what s that present 
i don t know 
let s find out 
 dear husband   
 i know you think you re moving
through this world unseen 
 don t believe
that for a second 
 i know where you ve been  and
i know where you re going  
 for this anniversary 
i ve arranged a trip 
 follow the river  up  up  up 
 sit back and relax 
because you are done  
what s  up  up river  
 up the river   prison 
fucking crazy bitch 
that s what this is 
she s framing me for her murder 
you married a
complete psychopath 
the morning of our
anniversary   
i was gonna ask her for a divorce 
i just couldn t do it 
i couldn t fake it for
another year  another day 
then what happened 
before i could say
anything  she said   
 i need you to go somewhere and
really think about our marriage  
she knew i would go
to sawyer beach 
so you d have no alibi 
she stage managed me 
she knew exactly what i would do 
and i fucking did it 
i went to the beach  i
thought about our marriage 
i came back and decided
i wanted a divorce 
and by the time you got home   
she was gone 
oh  you fuck 
she s good 
part of me was relieved   
when i thought she was gone 
punch and judy puppets 
remember  he beats judy to
death and kills that baby 
so i m punch 
we already knew that 
amy  what s your point 
does missouri have
the death penalty 
hey  neighbor 
it s been weeks since i had
anyone decent next door 
well  i don t know
how decent i feel 
well  as long as you
don t own a python   
and blast death metal at 4 am   
we re gonna be best friends 
all right  nice meeting you

bathroom cabinet

let me guess 
he s trying to watch the big
game and you just won t shut up 
no  you don t seem
like much of a talker 
oh  i got it 
you caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank   
and he apologized to you
by busting you a good one 
worse 
worse 
i went to the bar where
he works to surprise him 
and out he comes with this girl
who had no business
being in a bar 
on the very first
night that we met   
we walked by a bakery that was
having their sugar delivered 
and it was in the
air  everywhere 
a sugar storm 
and before he kissed me   
he leaned in   
and did this 
and guess what 
what 
he did the exact
same thing with her 
that is the most disgusting
thing i ever heard 
thank you 
wow 
thanks very much 
well  we ve gone mainstream 
it s an appeals process  so we
will attempt to appeal to them 
mr  bolt  tanner bolt

no  i believe you  it s just the
craziest thing i ve ever heard 
i love it  but  for
you  it sucks 
but you gotta have a
grudging respect   
for your wife at
this point  right 
are you laughing me out
of the building  no 
are you kidding me  i m in 
i m way in 
you came to the right guy 
this is what i do  nick 
this is why i have a  100 000 retainer 
i win the unwinnable cases 
 100 000 
we ll figure something out 
i ll give you a special   
 my wife is skilled in the
art of vengeance  rate 
okay 
so  what s the plan 
well  right now  it s a
 he said  she said  
she s telling a better story 
no  nick 
she is telling the
perfect story 
so  we need to start today to prepare
your defense  should we need it 
and if we decide to go
with your version of   
the truth 
then we ll need to realign the
public s perception of amy 
make them stop seeing her
as america s sweetheart   
and see her for what she is   
which a mind fucker
of the first degree 
now  that is a huge realignment 
we ll need other
voices besides yours 
there has to be
someone out there   
that she s screwed
with in the past 
there s a new york guy 
o hara  tommy o hara 
eight years ago   
she pressed charges against him 
that should be easy to find 
um  ex classmate  desi collings 
she said that he stalked her 
he s in st  louis 
you go talk to tommy  and
i ll draw up the contract 
i told you  you came
to the right guy 
apparently 
tommy 
yeah 
thanks for seeing me 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
urn  you re gonna want a drink 
yeah 
so  she said you
got physical with her 
no  dude  she said i raped her 
first degree  felony rape 
did you do it  did you do it 
yeah 
i was looking at
30 years to life 
did you get a trial  fuck  no 
do i look like i would
do well in the yard 
i pled down  man  sexual
assault one  no jail time 
that s something  oh  yeah 
i ve been unemployed for
the last eight years   
because i have to write  sexual
offender  on every job application 
i m on a neighborhood
watch list   
because i have to
register as a predator 
i haven t had a date
in almost a decade   
because if a girl googles me   
could you walk me
through what happened 
i meet amy at this
party  you know 
we click  she s perfect 
she s beautiful  she s
smart  she s well read   
she s got an ass like a
20 year old stripper 
i think   what s the catch  
a few months  it hits me 
this is not going to be easy 
girls like a
fixer upper  but amy 
she annexed me  she
made me her business 
it was just too much  she
went out and bought me ties 
and we must have gone
20 rounds over that 
ties  the whole thing
just became   
so  you broke up with her 
no  i just backed away 
gave her some space 
no big deal  right 
so i thought 
then one night  amy comes
over to my place   
with a bottle of bourbon and a
bootleg of this band i love 
and within two minutes  she s got
my pants around my ankles   
and she is kneeling down  and   
i m sorry  i know
it s your wife 
you had sex  yeah  consensual 
it was rough  but she
was screaming for it 
next morning  there s
two cops at my door 
amy has wounds that are
consistent with rape 
ligature marks on her
wrist  and my semen 
it looks like i ve tied amy
to my bed  and raped her 
me 
and then  guess what they find 
headboards of my bed 
one on each side 
the ties you wouldn t wear 
you do know your wife 
did you ever see her again 
yeah 
on tv  last week  with you 
i thought   there s amy 
 she s graduated from being
raped to being murdered  
mmm 
you been watching this  too 
last night s bombshell 
we just found out   
amy elliott dunne was  indeed 
pregnant when she went missing 
kelly capitono  this
makes me wanna throw up 
what is it about a
pregnant woman   
a woman carrying
life inside her   
that turns men into animals 
ellen  this
is an epidemic 
the third leading cause of
death among pregnant women   
is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband 
let s not forget about
the wife  ever 
tonight  we welcome amy s best
friend  noelle hawthorne 
thanks for being on
the show  noelle 
thank you  ellen 
and let me just say this   
amy would have loved you 
and all you do for women 
oh  that s nice 
why don t you tell us about your
friend  noelle 
amy was so nurturing 
oh  i d love if just once 
someone was like   
 she was a real rag  
she was beautiful
and smart and kind 
seems like a rich bitch to me 
what do you mean 
people love her 
i don t know 
she seems uppity 
spoiled rich girl  married
a cheating asshole 
paid the ultimate price 
the only secret
was her husband 
we never met nick 
he never introduced himself 
why was that  noelle 
why do you think 
i think we know why 
because he had a violent temper 
a little harsh 
that s life  baby 
he knew i d have seen
right through him 
don t get me wrong 
i m not saying it s
okay he killed her 
i m just saying  there
are consequences

and she was so innocent

nick keeps his father  who has
alzheimer s  in a facility 
number of times he
visited last year  one 
oh  fuck 
his twin sister  margo 
well  she is a peach 
these two spend their days
in the bar amy bought them 
playing what  lauren 
playing house 
what the fuck 
twin siblings often
enable and abet 
while i never examined
nick  or his sister   
they both seem very  very close 
it s twin cest 
disturbingly close  lauren 
and so  we close
with a question 
what kind of moral rot   
allows a beautiful  talented 
kind  smart  loving mother   
to vanish without the heavens
hearing our outraged cries 
can i bum a cigarette  yeah 
amy elliott dunne  we care about
you  and we will not forget 
and you know what
else we won t forget 
missouri has the death penalty 
amen 
i d like to report some
strange activity   
near the woodshed on the
property of one margo dunne 
hey 
mr  dunne 
mr  collings 
i know you  i saw you at
the volunteer center 
i wanted to help 
well  i hope you don t
mind me coming by 
i got your address from this
letter that you wrote my wife 
amy and i believe in the
lost art of letter writing 
i always wondered why you
kept in touch after   
everything 
you were together for two years
in boarding school  right 
she was my first
serious girlfriend 
why did you break up 
that s a strange question 
did you treat her bad 
did you cheat on her 
that s a rude question 
let me tell you
what amy told me 
she dumped you  you
completely unraveled 
you stalked her  you
threatened her   
and you attempted suicide in her
bed and were institutionalized 
your wife is missing  and you came
all this way to tell me this 
i thought there might be
another side to this story 
mr  collings 
fuck 
   the missing
persons case of amy elliott dunne 
she is the beautiful
blonde inspiration   
for the amazing amy
kids  book series 
you re reading that diary again 
you know how it ends 
it interests me 
hey  rhonda 
 he s gonna kill me   the end 
why did he go to his
dad s house to burn it 
it s private  there s
no one there 
why didn t he make sure
it actually burned 
because he tripped the alarm  you
were up his ass with a flashlight 
the whole thing
just feels hinky 
like finding an
envelope marked  clue  
you ever hear the expression   
 the simplest answer is
often the correct one  
actually  i ve never
found that to be true 
good night  good night 
hey 
elvis is in missouri 
thank god  come on in 
first thing you have
to understand about amy   
she loves to teach lessons 
play god 
yeah  old testament god 
okay  keep talking 
she finds out i ve been
cheating on her with andie   
decides to teach me a lesson 
fakes her own death 
frames me for it 
blood in the house  credit
cards  life insurance 
she does the treasure hunt 
now  the treasure
hunt is critical 
she s taking us on a
tour of my infidelities 
rubbing my nose in it 
and she leaves clue number
one for the police   
which will lead them
back to my office   
which is a place where
andie and i would often   
and she leaves a
pair of red panties 
right  racy  looks bad 
clue two  my father s house 
another place where
andie and i   
would occasionally
have relations 
clue three  woodshed 
also a location    oh  my god 
we had limited options  a hotel 
amy would have seen
the credit card bill 
put it on andie s credit card 
andie s statement went
right to her parents 
ew  nick  margo  can we head
over to the little brown house 
this leads us to what 
my dad s house 
dad s house is blue 
after the divorce  when dad
wasn t coming around   
i used to pretend that he was
a spy named mr  brown  who   
for the sake of his children s
safety  had to deny their existence 
you never told me that 
you told her that 
we ve got incriminating red
panties in your office 
we ve got a showcase showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed 
so  what in god s name is at
your father s house  nick 
and be honest 
i honestly have no idea 
well   
whatever they found  i think it s
safe to assume that it s very bad 
we got a lot of
uncontained issues here 
nick  do you have any idea as
to what andie s mindset is 
well  we haven t communicated
since the vigil 
okay  amy s parents 
no  it s    more pressure 
we got a hurt  young
girlfriend   
who will no doubt go
public at any moment 
no  andie won t do that 
she will 
they always do  don t
take it personally 
amy s got us in an
interesting bind 
we need to tell the
cops about andie 
really 
right now  andie just
gives you another motive 
we need to tell the cops
about the woodshed 
we need to be on the
front end of that 
but i m gonna warn you
as to what will happen 
they ll go after margo 
they can t do that  can they 
she s your accomplice  she
helped you hide the evidence 
in all likelihood  she
knows that you killed amy 
oh  god 
well  what are we going to do 
we find amy 
no  any other strategy
is missing the point 
i ve got two ex secret service
guys that are really good 
i ll put them on it 
but where do they start  nick 
where would amy go 
i have no idea 
oh 
are we keeping score 
hey 
i thought we were steering
clear of men for a while 
he s nice 
because he wants to fuck you 
she s still moping about her ex 
he got cheated on  too 
we three are the saddest
sacks in all the ozarks 
i m not sad 
i m angry 
there you go 
i almost drank myself to
death when my wife left me 
i was gonna kill myself 
can you believe that 
don t give him the pleasure 
i was going to drown myself
in the gulf of mexico   
let myself be dinner
for the great whites 
gulf is bull sharks 
miss nawlins 
why should i die  i m
not the asshole 
please
put that on a t shirt 
oh 
miss moneybags  l thought
you said you were broke 
that s a fat wad 
it s mostly singles 
singles  what are
you  a stripper 
swamp girls  or treasure chest 
we re just teasing 
don t they tease
people down in nola 
 we can expect
nick dunne s arrest any day now 
we ve got blood in the house 
huge debt  an unwanted pregnancy 
and we have amy elliott dunne 
missing for five days   
crying out for justice 
we ll be right back 
tanner has a very bad idea
he s going to pitch you 
yeah 
you re doing sharon schieber
tomorrow in st  louis 
it could go so wrong 
and you are going to
tell her about andie 
nope  whoa  whoa  whoa 
that sounds like
a very bad idea 
you haven t heard from
her in three days 
this is a ticking time bomb 
you ve gotta throw yourself on it 
people are gonna hate me 
and then  they will forgive you 
a guy admitting that he s a
gigantic asshole on television 
people empathize with that 
why don t we just put out a statement 
they need to see you 
sharon s specials  they
get 10 million viewers 
she is a crusader  if she
takes you on as a cause   
she s going to ask
real questions 
i will drill you as if you
were doing a deposition 
what to say  what not to say 
a trained monkey 
a trained monkey who doesn t
get the lethal injection 
nick  this case is about
what people think of you 
they need to like you 
now  you do this and you will
reach millions of those people 
maybe i only need to reach one 
hello

major shocking development   
in the amazing amy
disappearance 
we go live to that story now 
oh  my god 
you little slut 
my name is andie fitzgerald 
i met nicholas dunne   
when he was my creative writing
teacher at mill valley 
why is she dressed
like a babysitter 
i am deeply ashamed   
of having been romantically
involved with a married man 
the girl with the
giant cum on me tits 
i truly believed
we were in love 
now  she looks like a
fucking mennonite 
i know that is no excuse 
no  it is not 
i do not  in my heart  believe nick
dunne would have killed for me 
my prayers go out to
everyone who loves amy 
i apologize for the pain
this has caused them 
we have loved nick
dunne like a son 
that love ended today 
come on  you re
staring at ghosts 
he met our trust
with lie after lie 
we now absolutely believe   
nick is involved in the
disappearance of our daughter 
our amazing amy 
well  this just got
very exciting 
we need a moment 
we re gonna have to
bow out of this 
nothing has changed 
everything has changed 
an hour ago  we were ahead of this 
now 
i can handle this 
we re on the defense 
this is a completely
different dynamic 
i can handle it 
she s going to eat you alive 
just trust me 
okay 
great 
mic him

thank you 
he shouldn t smile at
the makeup artist 
yeah  no kidding

seriously  i can t believe
how fucking good you were 
amy brings out the best in me 
don t 
keep it
together  you two 
at least for the next 24 hours 
people still hate you 
women want to scratch
your eyes out 
andie was really good tv 
she s a good person 
therein lies the problem 
ride this out   
and when sharon airs tomorrow 
we ll be looking at
a whole new you 
but  until then   
don t show your face 
no problem 
welcome 
make yourself at home 
i ve got music  satellite   
netflix 
he was her teacher 
roku 
internet  obviously 
here is a supposedly
grown man   
if there is ever anything
you have a taste for   
and you can t find it   
just let me know and i
will get it for you 
instead of the a b c s  he
taught her the birds and the bees 
and just think how her mother
must feel at a time like this 
wine cellar s downstairs 
l ll get you some clothes  too 
not that i don t
appreciate bait shop chic 
the floors are heated 
just dial to your liking 
there s robes and towels 
the shower has steam 
the bathtub has a massage cycle 
there s a great view 
if you re in the mood 
blackout curtains if you re not 
the bed is savoir 
you ll never get a better sleep 
oh 
oh  this is just what i need 
i m so exhausted 
i ll leave you to it  then 
amy  l am so happy
that you are here 
and i don t want you to
worry for one moment 
there are cameras everywhere 
the exterior  all along the
grounds  the entryway 
anyone   
who is caught coming or going   
will be recorded 
ah 
you are more than safe 
and i am not letting
you get away again 
good morning 
don t do that 
i m sorry 
i need to feel safe 
you are very safe 
what have you been up to 
nothing 
amy  i m not nick 
it s hard for me 
after so many years under
someone s thumb   
i know just what
that feels like 
you were never under my thumb 
on your leash  never
a new start 
decent clothes 
hair dye  makeup  tweezers 
there s a gym
overlooking the lake 
the sooner you look
like yourself   
the sooner you ll
feel like yourself 
i ll get groceries
for tonight   
we ll watch sharon schieber 
and finally move on 
i think that s something i
should watch on my own 
nonsense 
i ll be back 
and i am looking forward   
to my reunion with amy elliott 
great 
good evening  i m
sharon schieber 
tonight  exclusively   
hurry up 
a husband breaks his silence   
not just on his wife s
disappearance   
but on his infidelity  and
all those shocking rumors 
nick dunne   
you re probably the most hated
man in america right now 
i probably am  and i
probably deserve it 
i bought that tie 
did you kill your wife  nick 
i did not kill my wife 
i am not a murderer 
but you were unfaithful 
i was unfaithful 
and i am deeply ashamed 
and  on top of that 
you allowed amy s parents   
her friends  all the
people in your hometown   
believe you were a
loving husband 
desperate to find
his missing wife 
well  i am desperate to
find my missing wife 
you say that  but
i m wondering   
how you expect us
to believe you   
now that we know you re a liar 
i didn t come forward
with my affair   
because i knew it would make
me look really  really bad 
but i don t care
about that anymore 
i just want to find my wife 
i m just
trying to get clear   
let me be clear 
just because l am not a murderer
doesn t make me a good guy 
i m not a good guy 
i was a bad husband
to a great wife 
i broke the vow
that i made to her 
those are pretty words  nick 
but what does that
really mean to you 
it basically means that
i was a con artist 
i met amy elliott
seven years ago 
i was completely transfixed 
amy can do that to you 
i was this average guy
from an average place   
with mediocre aspirations 
and i met a woman
who dazzled me 
and i wanted her to love me   
so i pretended to be
better than i was 
when we got married  i
promised to be that guy 
that guy who works harder 
that guy who  who
lives and acts   
and loves with as much
passion as she does 
but i failed her 
instead of doing
what was right   
i did what was easy 
you talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife 
who believes his
wife is still alive 
she is still alive 
will you look at
that camera for me 
will you look in the lens   
and talk to your wife 
if she is out there  able to
hear and see you tonight   
what would you like
to say to her  nick 
amy  i love you 
you re the best person
i ve ever known 
and i ve taken myself
to the woodshed   
for the way that
i ve treated you 
and if you come
back  i promise   
i will spend every day
making it up to you 
i will be the man that i
promised you i would be 
i love you 
come home 
here 
regardless of
what you thought   
what does it say 
i think we can all agree   
oh  my god  you
fucking killed it 
there s more to him
than meets the eye 
they re going crazy for you 
they disliked me  they
liked me  they hated me 
and now they love me 
a candor and an honesty
that s worthy of respect 
he s certainly earned mine 
what is it 
i m sharon schieber  good night 
margo dunne  this is a search
warrant for your property 
i usually ignore
tipline calls   
but a neighbor was
concerned about   
a strange man around
your woodshed 
call tanner 
okay  fuck 
girlfriend s real cute  nick 
is that what this is about 
i have treated you
more than fair   
throughout this
entire investigation 
i gave you the benefit of
the doubt over and over 
every time you said
something stupid   
i thought   maybe
he s just stupid  
but i was wrong  that s
what this is about 
are these the clubs you
don t play golf with 
none of that is mine 
none of this was put here by me 
those are nice clubs  you got
the makings of a real man cave 
everything just waiting until
the wife goes away for good 
nick 
hey  you can t do that 
of course we can 
amy  it s time to move on 
what can i do to help 
i need some time to think 
that s the last thing you need 
desi   
twenty years  you have
kept me dangling 
finally  last night  you came
to me  and you chose me 
follow that instinct 
don t trust the instinct that
left you beaten and homeless   
sleeping in your car

i just want you to be you again 
they only took
margo to fuck with you 
she s not spending another
fucking second in there 
i m gonna go in  and i m
gonna tell them everything 
what 
we tell boney very little 
without a body  without
a murder weapon   
their only hope is a confession 
so  you let them do
all the talking 
that way  we can
jump start your defense 
the truth is my defense 
recognize these 
yes  it s amy s anniversary
present to me 
was that how she told you
she was pregnant  nick 
mommy  daddy  baby  and
that made you real mad

recognize this  never seen
that before in my life 
it s amy s diary  we found
this at your father s house 
is this your wife s handwriting 
he s not a handwriting ex   
looks like it 
our experts thought so  too 
do you wanna play a
little true or false 
sure 
 and then he brushes the sugar
off my lips so he can taste me  
yeah  that s true 
you thought quinoa was a fish 
that is also true  yes 
she wanted to get pregnant 
you assaulted her 
i hit her  no  never happened 
 pushed   it says
 pushed   absolutely not 
i never touched her 
she tried to buy a gun 
i doubt that  but i don t know 
shall i read the last entry 
sure 
 this man may kill me  
in her own words   this
man may kill me  
it s kind of a
convenient end note 
for future reference   
the truth  you are not
a handwriting expert 
okay  i know 
judy s missing handle 
big as a two by four  right 
big as a club 
we found this day one  in the
fireplace in your home office 
we didn t know what the hell
it was  but fire in july 
we bagged it

18th century symphonies   
19th century impressionists 
quote proust in french

she s on fairly
heavy painkillers 
it s okay  i want to help 
ms  dunne  i know
what you ve been through   
so we ll keep this very brief 
can you walk us through
what happened 
that morning  the doorbell rang 
so normal 
i opened the door 
so strange 
since high school  he
won t ever go away 
and i ve just tried
to be nice to him 
answer his letters 
keep him calm 
oh  my god 
oh  i ve encouraged him 
you can t blame yourself 
he pushed inside 
and he grabbed me 
but i got away  and
ran to the kitchen 
and he clubbed me 
i collapsed 
that club was actually the handle
to a punch and judy puppet 
right 
treasure hunt 
i d hidden some
puppets at go s   
then how did desi
have that handle 
i d just found it 
it must have fallen off 
i   
was holding it when desi pushed in 
so  he got it from me 
about that woodshed   
he took me to his lake house 
tied me to his bed 
back to the woodshed real quick 
real quick 
when you went to place
the puppets there   
did you notice that
it was packed   
lots of stuff 
corresponding to
purchases made   
on credit cards in
your husband s name 
nick and credit cards 
he buys  i nag  i
don t know  probably 
he hid a lot of stuff at go s 
they re very close 
now  may i go back to where i
was being held prisoner   
by a man with a history
of mental problems 
please continue  ms  dunne 
desi assaulted me that night 
every night 
he tied me up like a dog 
and then  he d punish me 
starve me 
shave me 
sodomize me 
there were cameras everywhere 
please find this 
please find the tapes 
she slit his throat
with a box cutter 
how did she manage to get
a hold of a box cutter   
if he had her tied
up the whole time 
can t you just be happy
your wife is home and safe 
amy  we found your diary 
it contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse 
well  it s the ugly truth 
nick didn t want a baby 
he has a temper  we
had money problems 
but i love him 
then why did you
try to buy a gun 
i m sorry  i feel myself fading 
if i could just
clarify one thing   
if this case had been left in
your deeply incompetent hands   
my husband would
be on death row   
and i d be tied 
still  spread eagle   
ms  dunne  you ve been very brave 
we re finished 
now  i have to ask you   
do you feel safe going
home with your husband 
we prayed to god  and god
has answered our prayers 
amy dunne is home 
now  i know there are a lot
of questions and concerns   
but for right now  we
wanna sit tight   
and just be thankful
and grateful   
for this miracle on
the mississippi

you think you would be happy
with a nice midwestern girl 
no way  baby  i m it
