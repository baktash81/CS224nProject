wow impressive gal
yeah should i be concerned
i remember these
i loved these books
wait a minute
your wife is amazing amy
yeah she is
wow
amazingfuckingamy is
getting fucking married
thats how the night started
with me regular
flawed real amy
jealous as always
of the golden child
perfect brilliant amazing amy
whos getting fucking married
when i was 10 i quit cello
in the next book amazing
amy became a prodigy
did you play volleyball
i got cut freshman year
she made varsity
when did you have a dog
she got the dog
puddles made her more relatable
wow
i love your parents
but they really can be assholes
nick sir
hey thanks for coming man
no problem
hey sweetheart
big night for your mom
it would mean so much if you
would talk to a few reporters
bloggers give them
a little amy color
people wanna hear from you
we cant stay long fantastic
fifteen minutes tops
this is why i have
my brownstone
my trust fund i know
i cant complain
your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood
no they improved upon it
and then peddled
it to the masses
i thought you were gonna wear
white to match the wedding theme
i thought that would be creepy
if its worth doing
its worth doing
hold up i know how this ends
dont tell me
youre very cute nick
amy you know what would
make dads night
oh im on it
i love having strangers
pick at my scabs
im
curious whether
its difficult for you to see
amazing amy heading down the aisle
and this big party celebrating
this fictional wedding
because its my understanding
you are not married
is that correct
correct
amazing amy has always
been one step ahead of me
excuse me im sorry i
just have a few questions
its you
im here in a strictly
journalistic capacity
now you had the
distinct pleasure
of dating nick dunne
for how long
two magical years
in the course of that time
youve had the opportunity
to perform such
gracious gestures as
not correcting nick when he
pronounced quinoa as kweenoa
an understandable mistake
he also thought it was a fish
he thinks velveeta is a cheese
you also manage to appear
shocked and delighted
when nicks elderly mother breaks
into an impromptu rendition
of new york new york
every time she sees you
these
bag of bone shoes
thats just frightening
you also bought nick his
very first pair of scissors
and matching stapler
amy elliott you are
more than amazing
you are brilliant yet
entirely unsnobby
you challenge me
you surprise me
and fun fact for the readers
you have a worldclass vagina
my colleagues tell me that
you are not yet married
is that correct
im not
isnt it time we fixed that
and then
the night wasnt so bad anymore
and its done crossed
off the list
now normally we would
not treat this
as a missing persons
case so quick
but given the scene
at your house
and given our spike in
violent crime of late
we are gonna take this
very very seriously
okay good
weve got forensics
over at your place
you got somewhere to stay
i could stay at my sisters
okay
were tracking amys
phone her credit cards
we will organize
searches put up flyers
were gonna hold a press
conference tomorrow
youre having a
press conference
i wanna get the word out right
yeah its just all
of a sudden
i feel like im on a
law  order episode
time is of the essence
in these cases
but that said do you wanna
wait and call a lawyer
absolutely not i
just wanna help
so you and amy have
been here two years
you tend bar i own the bar
and i teach creative
writing at mvcc
no kids not yet
so what does amy do most days
a woman with all those
degrees what does she do
i dont know she keeps busy
doing what
shes a voracious reader
so shes always got
a book in her hand
well days can get long
i know a few housewives that evening
glass of wine starts coming at noon
or prescription pills
just last week
we had a soccer mom
nice lady got her teeth
kicked in over some oxycontin
ever since that mall went bust
half the town is out of work
we cannot keep up with
the drug violence
im pretty sure thats not it
has amy got friends
we can talk to
um
no not really
no friends this whole town
she was very close with my
mom before she passed away
you know we have a pretty
serious homeless problem
in our neighborhood
i think maybe you guys
should check that out
well look into that
you got to the bar
around 1100 today
where were you before that
just to cross that out
well i was home
i left at 930 i got a cup
of coffee a newspaper
i went to sawyer beach
and read the news
did you visit with anyone there
i kind of go to sawyer
beach for the solitude
so your wife has
no friends here
is she kinda standoffish
ivy league rubs
people the wrong way
shes from new york oh
shes complicated shes
got very high standards
type a
that can make you crazy
if youre not like that
you seem pretty laidback
type b
speaking of which
amys blood type
god i dont know id have
to look it up at the house
you dont know if
she has friends
you dont know what
she does all day
and you dont know your
wifes blood type

tanner bolt would you actually
consider defending nick dunne
well let me just say
as always ellen thank you
for such a warm welcome
but of course id
defend nick dunne
listen just because this guy
isnt walking around weeping
that doesnt mean that
hes not hurting
tanner the hallmark of a
sociopath is a lack of empathy
but the truth is youd
have to be a sociopath
to behave normally
in this situation
because its the most abnormal
situation in the world
tanner are you trying to
tell me that this photo
is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior
im so sick of being
picked apart by women
you need to hire tanner bolt
i dont deserve this
innocent until proven guilty
thats exactly what you deserve
go home nick
hey buddy

arrest anybody

blonde dunce says so

investigation not a witchhunt

to me that way ever
she was trying to buy a gun

my wife amy elliott dunne
disappeared three days ago
and i want to implore anyone who
has any information at all
please come forward help us
so hot ew he is so creepy
i wanna say something
because i think some of
you might be wondering
and are too polite to ask
i had nothing to do with the
disappearance of my wife
im cooperating with the police
i havent hired a lawyer
i have nothing to hide
amy is my soul mate
she is brilliant
shes charming and wise
i love you amy
asshole
i love my wife
so much
and i may not behave for the
cameras the way they want me to
and if they wanna punish
me for that thats okay
but i just wanna ask you in the
media please harass me
but dont harass the people of this town
if you need to mock
somebody mock me
nick
but please dont turn this
investigation into a circus
wheres your wife nick
let the police do their jobs
what did you do to
your pregnant wife
did you tell
them that nick
did you tell them amy
was six weeks pregnant
thank you for your support tonight
lets find amy
go ahead if you guys
wanna say something
gil go go
nick where
are you going
stop him
no questions right now
thank you
why are you running away
dont run
everybody stay back
guys come on you know better
get off the grass get
down to the curb
on it
all right
all right yall heard her
no pictures
hello
hello
fuck
you scared me want a drink
did you know she was pregnant
i told you noelle hawthorne
is fucking crazy
she doesnt even know amy
they look like pretty
good friends to me
look i dont know
but it certainly doesnt
prove that shes pregnant
we have her medical
records coming
good so lets
talk while we wait
lets start over here
the scene of the crime
you see weve seen
dozens of home invasions
dozens and dozens
this area right here it looked
wrong from the second we saw it
the whole thing looked staged
watch this
and yet they remained upright
throughout this lifeanddeath struggle
i dont know what do
you want me to say
did you do any housekeeping the
day your wife went missing
no because our guys
did a luminol test
and im sorry to tell you
but that kitchen lit up
amy lost a lot of blood
in there nick a lot
oh my god
yeah and then
somebody mopped it up
oh wait a second why would
they mop up the blood
if theyre trying to
stage a crime scene
no blood and no body
suggests kidnapping
it tells us look at
people outside the house
like these homeless
you keep mentioning
a pool of blood and no
body suggests homicide
it tells us to look at
people inside the house
which is what were
doing here nick
i see
so how was
your marriage nick
because right now all
we got is noelle
she says not good
gil what do you and
your wife argue about
what pisses you off oh
money lack thereof
me and my
ex its the same
i mention that because we got a
look at your finances nick
117000 in credit card debt
what i pulled up some
of the merchandise
there are these fun
little splurges
i didnt buy
any of this stuff
i dont even golf
i do you bought great clubs
i like the robot dog
this is identity theft
this is a felony
we need to find
out who did this
all right lets talk
about life insurance
because in april you bumped
up amys life insurance
to 12 million
yes i did that was her idea
she wanted me to
you filed the paperwork
because she told me to whoa
hold on a sec
yeah okay
for sure
all right
she was pregnant
this is insane
so my question becomes
i dont want to talk
to you again ever
without a lawyer
margo
hey
just hold on a second
let me finish
nick
i hear you i hear you
i was as surprised as
i know youre upset i had
no idea she was pregnant
listen i thought so too
but evidently that wasnt
you want to know the truth
the truth is amy
didnt want kids
well im as surprised as
you told me you
didnt want kids
i was trying
to put a good face on
then suddenly youve
got a pregnant wife
thats a problem for you
especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend
oh stop watching ellen abbott
you have to fucking talk to me
i didnt tell you that
she didnt want kids
because she didnt want me to
because it would
have just been
another reason for
you to hate her
and we had enough of those already
it was easier to just
lie to me i wanted kids
when we first moved here i
went to a fertility clinic
it didnt work i did my part
masturbate when it came time
for amy to do her thing all
of a sudden it was like
well i dont know maybe
no thanks
now who would believe you
all right
this is a letter
from the clinic
notifying me that theyre
gonna destroy my sample
unless i contact them
so i gave it to amy
the next day i saw
it in the trash
but you were already with
andie by then right
i wanted a baby with amy
a year ago amy
being pregnant
would have been the
best thing ever
when your poor amy has a
cold this dessert just
this is the clue you
couldnt solve
yeah
a letter from desi
that creepy boyfriend of amys
it was the fucking rich guy who
would do anything for her
it just kept hanging over my head
it was disgusting
your prenup
nick why have you
kept this stuff
its like a little box of hate
i dont know go
maybe i hate her
i love you no matter what
but you need to tell me
tell you what
what are you asking me
are you asking me if i
killed my wife go
is that what youre asking me
if i murdered my wife
i would never ask you that
margo
dont walk on the glass
oh
you have no clue do you
why was he
here that night
his wife is missing
why come here
who cares
rhonda we got this
lets make the arrest
do you know how hard it is to make
a murder case without a body
no
well its incredibly hard
so i want one last thing
whats that
i want a body
picture me im a
girl whos very very bad
be careful
i need to be punished and
by punished i mean had
fuck
its where you keep
goodies for anniversary five
so open the door
punish wood beach
and look alive
punish wood
wood
i will practice believing
my husband loves me
and will love this baby
that this child might
really save our marriage
but i could be wrong
because sometimes
the way he looks at me
i think
man of my dreams
father of my child
this man of mine may kill me
he may truly
kill me
wtf
i am so much happier
now that im dead
technically missing
soon to be presumed dead
gone
and my lazy lying cheating
oblivious husband
will go to prison for my murder
nick dunne took my pride
and my dignity
and my hope and my money
he took and took from me
until i no longer existed
thats murder
let the punishment
fit the crime
to fake a convincing murder
you have to have discipline
you befriend a local idiot
harvest the details
of her humdrum life
and cram her with stories about
your husbands violent temper
secretly create some
money troubles
credit cards perhaps
online gambling
with the help of
the unwitting
bump up your life insurance
purchase getaway car
craigslist
generic cheap pay cash
you need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss
and america loves
pregnant women
as if its so hard
to spread your legs
you know whats hard
faking a pregnancy
first drain your toilet
invite pregnant idiot
into your home
and ply her with lemonade
steal pregnant idiots urine
voilà
a pregnancy is now part of
your legal medical record
happy anniversary
wait for your
clueless husband
to start his day
off he goes
and the clock is ticking
meticulously stage
your crime scene
with just enough mistakes to
raise the specter of doubt
you need to bleed
a lot
a lot a lot
a head wound kind of bleed
a crime scene kind of bleed
you need to clean poorly
like he would
clean and bleed
bleed and clean
and leave a little
something behind
a fire in july
and because youre you
you dont stop there
you need a diary
minimum 300 entries on
the nick and amy story
start with the fairy
tale early days
those are true and
theyre crucial
you want nick and
amy to be likeable
after that you in vent
the spending
the abuse the fear
the threat of violence
and nick thought
he was the writer
burn it just the right amount
make sure the cops will find it
finally honor tradition with
a very special treasure hunt
and if i get everything right
the world will hate nick
for killing his
beautiful pregnant wife
and after all the outrage
when im ready
ill go out on the water
with a handful of pills
and a pocket full of stones
and when they find my
body theyll know
nick dunne dumped his
beloved like garbage
and she floated down
past all the other
abused unwanted
inconvenient women
then nick will die too
nick and amy will be gone
but then we never
really existed
nick loved a girl i
was pretending to be
cool girl
men always use that as
their defining compliment
shes a cool girl
cool girl is hot
cool girl is game
cool girl is fun
cool girl never gets
angry at her man
she only smiles in a
chagrined loving manner
and then presents her
mouth for fucking
she likes what he likes
so evidently hes a vinyl
hipster who loves fetish manga
if he likes girls gone
wild shes a mall babe
who talks football and endures
buffalo wings at hooters
when i met nick dunne i
knew he wanted cool girl
and for him ill admit
i was willing to try
i waxstripped my pussy raw
i drank canned beer watching
adam sandier movies
i ate cold pizza and
remained a size two
i blew him semiregularly
i lived in the moment
i was fucking game
i cant say i didnt
enjoy some of it
nick teased out of me things
i didnt know existed
a lightness a humor an ease
but i made him smarter sharper
i inspired him to
rise to my level
i forged the man of my dreams
we were happy pretending
to be other people
we were the happiest
couple we knew
and whats the point of being
together if youre not the happiest
but nick got lazy
he became someone i did
not agree to marry
he actually expected me to
love him unconditionally
then he dragged me penniless to
the navel of this great country
and found himself a newer
younger bouncier
cool girl
you think id let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever
no fucking way
he doesnt get to win
my cute charming
saltoftheearth missouri guy
he needed to learn
grownups work for things
grownups pay
grownups suffer consequences
wait
i need 20 seconds where you
dont judge me interrupt me
or get angry
okay
is that all the stuff
from the credit cards
where do you store goodies
for anniversary five
wood
woodshed
yeah my woodshed
that fucking bitch
i thought its all right
i would have too
whats that present
i dont know
lets find out
dear husband
i know you think youre moving
through this world unseen
dont believe
that for a second
i know where youve been and
i know where youre going
for this anniversary
ive arranged a trip
follow the river up up up
sit back and relax
because you are done
whats up up river
up the river prison
fucking crazy bitch
thats what this is
shes framing me for her murder
you married a
complete psychopath
the morning of our
anniversary
i was gonna ask her for a divorce
i just couldnt do it
i couldnt fake it for
another year another day
then what happened
before i could say
anything she said
i need you to go somewhere and
really think about our marriage
she knew i would go
to sawyer beach
so youd have no alibi
she stagemanaged me
she knew exactly what i would do
and i fucking did it
i went to the beach i
thought about our marriage
i came back and decided
i wanted a divorce
and by the time you got home
she was gone
oh you fuck
shes good
part of me was relieved
when i thought she was gone
punch and judy puppets
remember he beats judy to
death and kills that baby
so im punch
we already knew that
amy whats your point
does missouri have
the death penalty
hey neighbor
its been weeks since i had
anyone decent next door
well i dont know
how decent i feel
well as long as you
dont own a python
and blast death metal at 4 am

oh i just bet you are
lotions and balms ointment
i would hate for yall
to get tan lines
so sweet
okay you know where ill be
i see we have the
same taste in men
i clipped it on a
bathroom cabinet
least you could do is not
keep his secrets for him
let me guess
hes trying to watch the big
game and you just wont shut up
no you dont seem
like much of a talker
oh i got it
you caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank
and he apologized to you
by busting you a good one
worse
worse
i went to the bar where
he works to surprise him
and out he comes with this girl
who had no business
being in a bar
on the very first
night that we met
we walked by a bakery that was
having their sugar delivered
and it was in the
air everywhere
a sugar storm
and before he kissed me
he leaned in
and did this
and guess what
what
he did the exact
same thing with her
that is the most disgusting
thing i ever heard
thank you
wow
thanks very much
well weve gone mainstream
its an appeals process so we
will attempt to appeal to them
mr bolt tanner bolt
nick dunne
i have been sitting by
the phone my friend
im sorry
do you not believe me
no i believe you its just the
craziest thing ive ever heard
i love it but for
you it sucks
but you gotta have a
grudging respect
for your wife at
this point right
are you laughing me out
of the building no
are you kidding me im in
im way in
you came to the right guy
this is what i do nick
this is why i have a 100000 retainer
i win the unwinnable cases
well figure something out
ill give you a special
my wife is skilled in the
art of vengeance rate
okay
so whats the plan
well right now its a
he said she said
shes telling a better story
no nick
she is telling the
perfect story
so we need to start today to prepare
your defense should we need it
and if we decide to go
with your version of
the truth
then well need to realign the
publics perception of amy
make them stop seeing her
as americas sweetheart
and see her for what she is
which a mindfucker
of the first degree
now that is a huge realignment
well need other
voices besides yours
there has to be
someone out there
that shes screwed
with in the past
theres a new york guy
ohara tommy ohara
eight years ago
she pressed charges against him
that should be easy to find
um exclassmate desi collings
she said that he stalked her
hes in st louis
you go talk to tommy and
ill draw up the contract
i told you you came
to the right guy
apparently
tommy
yeah
thanks for seeing me
yeah yeah yeah
urn youre gonna want a drink
yeah
so she said you
got physical with her
no dude she said i raped her
first degree felony rape
did you do it did you do it
yeah
i was looking at
30 years to life
did you get a trial fuck no
do i look like i would
do well in the yard
i pled down man sexual
assault one no jail time
thats something oh yeah
ive been unemployed for
the last eight years
because i have to write sexual
offender on every job application
im on a neighborhood
watch list
because i have to
register as a predator
i havent had a date
in almost a decade
because if a girl googles me
could you walk me
through what happened
i meet amy at this
party you know
we click shes perfect
shes beautiful shes
smart shes wellread
shes got an ass like a
20yearold stripper
i think whats the catch
a few months it hits me
this is not going to be easy
girls like a
fixerupper but amy
she annexed me she
made me her business
it was just too much she
went out and bought me ties
and we must have gone
20 rounds over that
ties the whole thing
just became
so you broke up with her
no i just backed away
gave her some space
no big deal right
so i thought
then one night amy comes
over to my place
with a bottle of bourbon and a
bootleg of this band i love
and within two minutes shes got
my pants around my ankles
and she is kneeling down and
im sorry i know
its your wife
you had sex yeah consensual
it was rough but she
was screaming for it
next morning theres
two cops at my door
amy has wounds that are
consistent with rape
ligature marks on her
wrist and my semen
it looks like ive tied amy
to my bed and raped her
me
and then guess what they find
headboards of my bed
one on each side
the ties you wouldnt wear
you do know your wife
did you ever see her again
yeah
on tv last week with you
i thought theres amy
shes graduated from being
raped to being murdered
mmm
you been watching this too
last nights bombshell
we just found out
amy elliott dunne was indeed
pregnant when she went missing
kelly capitono this
makes me wanna throw up
what is it about a
pregnant woman
a woman carrying
life inside her
that turns men into animals
ellen this
is an epidemic
the third leading cause of
death among pregnant women
is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband
lets not forget about
the wife ever
tonight we welcome amys best
friend noelle hawthorne
thanks for being on
the show noelle
thank you ellen
and let me just say this
amy would have loved you
and all you do for women
oh thats nice
why dont you tell us about your
friend noelle
amy was so nurturing
oh id love if just once
someone was like
she was a real rag
she was beautiful
and smart and kind
seems like a rich bitch to me
what do you mean
people love her
i dont know
she seems uppity
spoiled rich girl married
a cheating asshole
paid the ultimate price
the only secret
was her husband
we never met nick
he never introduced himself
why was that noelle
why do you think
i think we know why
because he had a violent temper
a little harsh
thats life baby
he knew id have seen
right through him
dont get me wrong
im not saying its
okay he killed her
im just saying there
are consequences
fuck yeah
she was so alone
and she was so innocent
youre a good friend noelle and
youre a good friend of the show
thanks for coming on

nick keeps his father who has
alzheimers in a facility
number of times he
visited last year one
oh fuck
his twin sister margo
well she is a peach
these two spend their days
in the bar amy bought them
playing what lauren
playing house
what the fuck
twin siblings often
enable and abet
while i never examined
nick or his sister
they both seem very very close
its twincest
disturbingly close lauren
and so we close
with a question
what kind of moral rot
allows a beautiful talented
kind smart loving mother
to vanish without the heavens
hearing our outraged cries
can i bum a cigarette yeah
amy elliott dunne we care about
you and we will not forget
and you know what
else we wont forget
missouri has the death penalty
amen
id like to report some
strange activity
near the woodshed on the
property of one margo dunne
hey
mr dunne
mr collings
i know you i saw you at
the volunteer center
i wanted to help
well i hope you dont
mind me coming by
i got your address from this
letter that you wrote my wife
amy and i believe in the
lost art of letterwriting
i always wondered why you
kept in touch after
everything
you were together for two years
in boarding school right
she was my first
serious girlfriend
why did you break up
thats a strange question
did you treat her bad
did you cheat on her
thats a rude question
let me tell you
what amy told me
she dumped you you
completely unraveled
you stalked her you
threatened her
and you attempted suicide in her
bed and were institutionalized
your wife is missing and you came
all this way to tell me this
i thought there might be
another side to this story
mr collings
fuck
the missing
persons case of amy elliott dunne
she is the beautiful
blonde inspiration
for the amazing amy
kids book series
youre reading that diary again
you know how it ends
it interests me
hey rhonda
hes gonna kill me the end
why did he go to his
dads house to burn it
its private theres
no one there
why didnt he make sure
it actually burned
because he tripped the alarm you
were up his ass with a flashlight
the whole thing
just feels hinky
like finding an
envelope marked clue
you ever hear the expression
the simplest answer is
often the correct one
actually ive never
found that to be true
good night good night
hey
elvis is in missouri
thank god come on in
first thing you have
to understand about amy
she loves to teach lessons
play god
yeah old testament god
okay keep talking
she finds out ive been
cheating on her with andie
decides to teach me a lesson
fakes her own death
frames me for it
blood in the house credit
cards life insurance
she does the treasure hunt
now the treasure
hunt is critical
shes taking us on a
tour of my infidelities
rubbing my nose in it
and she leaves clue number
one for the police
which will lead them
back to my office
which is a place where
andie and i would often
and she leaves a
pair of red panties
right racy looks bad
clue two my fathers house
another place where
andie and i
would occasionally
have relations
clue three woodshed
also a location oh my god
we had limited options a hotel
amy would have seen
the credit card bill
put it on andies credit card
andies statement went
right to her parents
ew nick margo can we head
over to the little brown house
this leads us to what
my dads house
dads house is blue
after the divorce when dad
wasnt coming around
i used to pretend that he was
a spy named mr brown who
for the sake of his childrens
safety had to deny their existence
you never told me that
you told her that
weve got incriminating red
panties in your office
weve got a showcase showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed
so what in gods name is at
your fathers house nick
and be honest
i honestly have no idea
well
whatever they found i think its
safe to assume that its very bad
we got a lot of
uncontained issues here
nick do you have any idea as
to what andies mindset is
well we havent communicated
since the vigil
okay amys parents
no its more pressure
we got a hurt young
girlfriend
who will no doubt go
public at any moment
no andie wont do that
she will
they always do dont
take it personally
amys got us in an
interesting bind
we need to tell the
cops about andie
really
right now andie just
gives you another motive
we need to tell the cops
about the woodshed
we need to be on the
front end of that
but im gonna warn you
as to what will happen
theyll go after margo
they cant do that can they
shes your accomplice she
helped you hide the evidence
in all likelihood she
knows that you killed amy
oh god
well what are we going to do
we find amy
no any other strategy
is missing the point
ive got two exsecret service
guys that are really good
ill put them on it
but where do they start nick
where would amy go
i have no idea
oh
are we keeping score
hey
i thought we were steering
clear of men for a while
hes nice
because he wants to fuck you
shes still moping about her ex
he got cheated on too
we three are the saddest
sacks in all the ozarks
im not sad
im angry
there you go
i almost drank myself to
death when my wife left me
i was gonna kill myself
can you believe that
dont give him the pleasure
i was going to drown myself
in the gulf of mexico
let myself be dinner
for the great whites
gulf is bull sharks
miss nawlins
why should i die im
not the asshole
please
put that on a tshirt

a very bad idea

a guy admitting that hes a
gigantic asshole on television
people empathize with that

takes you on as a cause
shes going to ask
real questions

a trained monkey

your dads scorched earth
lets talk about your
mom how close you were

built up implies that an
explosion is coming no
at a certain point we
got on the wrong track
i had a moment of weakness
your moment was
over 15 months
i disrespected my wife
and i disrespected my marriage
and ill always regret it
that works
dont be afraid to play up the
dufus husband thing nick

im sorry
we have a
major shocking development
in the amazing amy
disappearance
we go live to that story now
oh my god
you little slut
my name is andie fitzgerald
i met nicholas dunne
when he was my creative writing
teacher at mill valley
why is she dressed
like a babysitter
i am deeply ashamed
of having been romantically
involved with a married man
the girl with the
giant cumonme tits
i truly believed
we were in love
now she looks like a
fucking mennonite
i know that is no excuse
no it is not
i do not in my heart believe nick
dunne would have killed for me
my prayers go out to
everyone who loves amy
i apologize for the pain
this has caused them
we have loved nick
dunne like a son
that love ended today
come on youre
staring at ghosts
he met our trust
with lie after lie
we now absolutely believe
nick is involved in the
disappearance of our daughter
our amazing amy
well this just got
very exciting
we need a moment
were gonna have to
bow out of this
nothing has changed
everything has changed
an hour ago we were ahead of this
now
i can handle this
were on the defense
this is a completely
different dynamic
i can handle it
shes going to eat you alive
just trust me
okay
great
mic him
one two three four five
thank you
he shouldnt smile at
the makeup artist
yeah no kidding
roll tape
five four
three two
seriously i cant believe
how fucking good you were
amy brings out the best in me
dont
keep it
together you two
at least for the next 24 hours
people still hate you
women want to scratch
your eyes out
andie was really good tv
shes a good person
therein lies the problem
ride this out
and when sharon airs tomorrow
well be looking at
a whole new you
but until then
dont show your face
no problem
welcome
make yourself at home
ive got music satellite
netflix
he was her teacher
roku
internet obviously
here is a supposedly
grown man
if there is ever anything
you have a taste for
and you cant find it
just let me know and i
will get it for you
instead of the abcs he
taught her the birds and the bees
and just think how her mother
must feel at a time like this
wine cellars downstairs
lll get you some clothes too
not that i dont
appreciate bait shop chic
the floors are heated
just dial to your liking
theres robes and towels
the shower has steam
the bathtub has a massage cycle
theres a great view
if youre in the mood
blackout curtains if youre not
the bed is savoir
youll never get a better sleep
oh
oh this is just what i need
im so exhausted
ill leave you to it then
amy l am so happy
that you are here
and i dont want you to
worry for one moment
there are cameras everywhere
the exterior all along the
grounds the entryway
anyone
who is caught coming or going
will be recorded
ah
you are more than safe
and i am not letting
you get away again
good morning
dont do that
im sorry
i need to feel safe
you are very safe
what have you been up to
nothing
amy im not nick
its hard for me
after so many years under
someones thumb
i know just what
that feels like
you were never under my thumb
on your leash never
a new start
decent clothes
hair dye makeup tweezers
theres a gym
overlooking the lake
the sooner you look
like yourself
the sooner youll
feel like yourself
ill get groceries
for tonight
well watch sharon schieber
and finally move on
i think thats something i
should watch on my own
nonsense
ill be back
and i am looking forward
to my reunion with amy elliott
great
good evening im
sharon schieber
tonight exclusively
hurry up
a husband breaks his silence
not just on his wifes
disappearance
but on his infidelity and
all those shocking rumors
nick dunne
youre probably the most hated
man in america right now
i probably am and i
probably deserve it
i bought that tie
did you kill your wife nick
i did not kill my wife
i am not a murderer
but you were unfaithful
i was unfaithful
and i am deeply ashamed
and on top of that
you allowed amys parents
her friends all the
people in your hometown
believe you were a
loving husband
desperate to find
his missing wife
well i am desperate to
find my missing wife
you say that but
im wondering
how you expect us
to believe you
now that we know youre a liar
i didnt come forward
with my affair
because i knew it would make
me look really really bad
but i dont care
about that anymore
i just want to find my wife
im just
trying to get clear
let me be clear
just because l am not a murderer
doesnt make me a good guy
im not a good guy
i was a bad husband
to a great wife
i broke the vow
that i made to her
those are pretty words nick
but what does that
really mean to you
it basically means that
i was a con artist
i met amy elliott
seven years ago
i was completely transfixed
amy can do that to you
i was this average guy
from an average place
with mediocre aspirations
and i met a woman
who dazzled me
and i wanted her to love me
so i pretended to be
better than i was
when we got married i
promised to be that guy
that guy who works harder
that guy who who
lives and acts
and loves with as much
passion as she does
but i failed her
instead of doing
what was right
i did what was easy
you talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife
who believes his
wife is still alive
she is still alive
will you look at
that camera for me
will you look in the lens
and talk to your wife
if she is out there able to
hear and see you tonight
what would you like
to say to her nick
amy i love you
youre the best person
ive ever known
and ive taken myself
to the woodshed
for the way that
ive treated you
and if you come
back i promise
i will spend every day
making it up to you
i will be the man that i
promised you i would be
i love you
come home
here
regardless of
what you thought
what does it say
i think we can all agree
oh my god you
fucking killed it
theres more to him
than meets the eye
theyre going crazy for you
they disliked me they
liked me they hated me
and now they love me
a candor and an honesty
thats worthy of respect
hes certainly earned mine
what is it
im sharon schieber good night
margo dunne this is a search
warrant for your property
i usually ignore
tipline calls
but a neighbor was
concerned about
a strange man around
your woodshed
call tanner
okay fuck
girlfriends real cute nick
is that what this is about
i have treated you
more than fair
throughout this
entire investigation
i gave you the benefit of
the doubt over and over
every time you said
something stupid
i thought maybe
hes just stupid
but i was wrong thats
what this is about
are these the clubs you
dont play golf with
none of that is mine
none of this was put here by me
those are nice clubs you got
the makings of a real man cave
everything just waiting until
the wife goes away for good
nick
hey you cant do that
of course we can
amy its time to move on
what can i do to help
i need some time to think
thats the last thing you need
desi
twenty years you have
kept me dangling
finally last night you came
to me and you chose me
follow that instinct
dont trust the instinct that
left you beaten and homeless
sleeping in your car
fearing for your life
im not gonna force
myself on you
i understand what
youre saying desi
i do
ive been so mistreated
for so long
ive forgotten how to behave
ill move in here tomorrow
and well work it out together
i just want you to be you again
they only took
margo to fuck with you
shes not spending another
fucking second in there
im gonna go in and im
gonna tell them everything
what
we tell boney very little
without a body without
a murder weapon
their only hope is a confession
so you let them do
all the talking
that way we can
jumpstart your defense
the truth is my defense
recognize these
yes its amys anniversary
present to me
was that how she told you
she was pregnant nick
mommy daddy baby and
that made you real mad
no
recognize this never seen
that before in my life
its amys diary we found
this at your fathers house
is this your wifes handwriting
hes not a handwriting ex
looks like it
our experts thought so too
do you wanna play a
little true or false
sure
and then he brushes the sugar
off my lips so he can taste me
yeah thats true
you thought quinoa was a fish
that is also true yes
she wanted to get pregnant
you assaulted her
i hit her no never happened
pushed it says
pushed absolutely not
i never touched her
she tried to buy a gun
i doubt that but i dont know
shall i read the last entry
sure
this man may kill me
in her own words this
man may kill me
its kind of a
convenient end note
for future reference
the truth you are not
a handwriting expert
okay i know
judys missing handle
big as a twobyfour right
big as a club
we found this day one in the
fireplace in your home office
we didnt know what the hell
it was but fire in july
we bagged it
ive never seen
that before either
we just tested it fire
doesnt erase blood nick
so finally nicholas dunne
youre under arrest for
the murder of your wife
do not say another word
what about my side nick
more coffee
id love it
remember that time we skipped
school and drove to the cape
oh god yeah lobster
right from the ocean
this reminds me of that
neverending holiday
youre not bored
desi how could i be bored
you can discuss
18thcentury symphonies
19thcentury impressionists
quote proust in french
nicks idea of culture was
a reality tv marathon
with one hand down his boxers
i really have to get going
but i will be back
just as soon as i can
my keys
thank you
ow
thats how the kids wear it
dunne you got one
hell of a lawyer

now that i know you didnt
murder your wife yes
what do you think
kidnapping the storys insane
shes on fairly
heavy painkillers
its okay i want to help
ms dunne i know
what youve been through
so well keep this very brief
can you walk us through
what happened
that morning the doorbell rang
so normal
i opened the door
so strange
since high school he
wont ever go away
and ive just tried
to be nice to him
answer his letters
keep him calm
oh my god
oh ive encouraged him
you cant blame yourself
he pushed inside
and he grabbed me
but i got away and
ran to the kitchen
and he clubbed me
i collapsed
that club was actually the handle
to a punch and judy puppet
right
treasure hunt
id hidden some
puppets at gos
then how did desi
have that handle
id just found it
it must have fallen off
i
was holding it when desi pushed in
so he got it from me
about that woodshed
he took me to his lake house
tied me to his bed
back to the woodshed real quick
real quick
when you went to place
the puppets there
did you notice that
it was packed
lots of stuff
corresponding to
purchases made
on credit cards in
your husbands name
nick and credit cards
he buys i nag i
dont know probably
he hid a lot of stuff at gos
theyre very close
now may i go back to where i
was being held prisoner
by a man with a history
of mental problems
please continue ms dunne
desi assaulted me that night
every night
he tied me up like a dog
and then hed punish me
starve me
shave me
sodomize me
there were cameras everywhere
please find this

she slit his throat
with a box cutter

a hold of a box cutter
if he had her tied
up the whole time
cant you just be happy
your wife is home and safe
amy we found your diary
it contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse
well its the ugly truth
nick didnt want a baby
he has a temper we
had money problems
but i love him
then why did you
try to buy a gun
im sorry i feel myself fading
if i could just
clarify one thing

be on death row
and id be tied

ms dunne youve been very brave
were finished
now i have to ask you
do you feel safe going
home with your husband
we prayed to god and god
has answered our prayers
