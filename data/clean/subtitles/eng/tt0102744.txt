  the yank marston s brought out 
  yank 
come to do for marston what these
bog lrish convicts obviously can t 
well  you just do yourjob

in our experience 
americans are uncouth misfits
who have been run out
of their own barbaric country 
  well  lieutenant   
  major 
major  we already run
the misfits out of our country 
we sent  em back to england 
what are they  koala bears

with soap if i had some 
lady  you are about
half a bubble off the plumb 
and that s for sure and for certain 
just because the road is rocky  doesn t
mean your spirits should get rocky  too 
when do we get to marston s ranch 
been on his bloody land
for the last two days 
things seem different here 
they say god made australia last 
don t you know 
after he got tired of making
everything else the same 
well  i ve seen some pretty country 
that s for certain 
what are you doing so far from home 
there hasn t been anyone else but you 
you know that  don t you 
you can take me if you want to  roy 
god almighty  lady  go to sleep 
whoo hoo 
hey  look at that 
hey up 
good to see you 
get back to work 
here you go  lads 
wait till you see
what we ve got for you 
matthew quigley 
elliott marston  welcome to australia 
well  sir  your men already welcomed me 
coogan  mr  quigley s luggage 
take it to the lodge 
mr  marston  you said you d
pay me 50 dollars in gold coin
  just for showing up 
  you don t waste much time 
i spent three months on a boat
just gettin  here 
you intrigued me  mr  quigley 
twenty one men answered my
advertisement  from all over the world 
canada  india  england 
they just wrote letters 
but you    had a way with words 
my advertisement stated that i wanted to
hire the finest marksman in the world 
have i 
uh huh 
the legendary sharp 
you know your weapons 
it s a lever action breech loader 
usual barrel length s 30 inches 
this one has an extra four 
it s converted to use a special
 45 caliber  110 grain metal cartridge
with a 540 grain paper patched bullet 
it s fitted with double set triggers
and a vernier sight 
it s marked up to 1200 yards 
this one shoots a mite further 
an experimental weapon
with experimental ammunition 
you could call it that 
let s experiment 
whitey  take that bucket
and ride out until i signal 
tell me when you want him to stop 
your man able to hit
something that far away 
i don t know him 
i never saw him before 
he d have to be a good shot all right 
 bout there ll do 
bullshit 
are you quite certain  mr  quigley 
that you wouldn t like
the bucket a bit closer 
jesus christ 
quite certain 
told you  only my roy could
hit a coyote from that distance 
very impressive  you re hired 
would you excuse me for a minute 
there s some business
i have to attend to 
you might find this interesting 
nice shootin   roy 
mr  marston 
i think there s been a mistake 
the one they call crazy cora 
i d appreciate it
if your men leave her alone
  till you and i have a chance to talk 
  whatever you want 
you are deserters from
her majesty s armed forces 
the penalty for your crime is death 
you were caught on my land 
i could have you shot for trespassing 
look  you let us stay here 
guv nor  we ll serve you proper 
better than this
convict scum you ve got 
well  unfortunately  your commanding
officer major ashley pitt and i
have an understanding 
and so  i m afraid 
you ll be sent back
to face the firing party 
but i see no reason why you
should be trussed up like animals 
mr  dobkin 
this is my preferred weapon 
mr  quigley 
do join me for dinner 
you ve got to admit  the yank s
a damn good shot with a long rifle 
oh  sure  but you give me
a weapon like that 
and i could beat him with my eyes shut 
easy to say  o flynn 
you ve got a lot to learn 
i ain t got a lot to learn  look at you 
dobkin  you ve been here 12 years 
and all you ve got to show for it
is cold mutton 
he s in  getting a fancy dinner 
huh 
you were actually in dodge city 
william hickok must have been there 
spent a night there once 
i was pretty tired 
dodge city s a nice place
to get some sleep 
are you familiar with
the army revolver  mr  quigley 
well  sir  i never had much use for one 
it s a recent invention of
your countryman  colonel colt 
god created all men  they say
sam colt made  em equal  more or less 
that s what i like about you americans 
you re people of action  not words 
that mint jelly on your lamb 
it s my own creation 
no  i m a student of your american west 
i ve read a great deal about it 
tell me about dingoes 
ten pounds a month
for shooting wild dogs
seems like a whole lot for not much 
besides  you got enough men
and guns outside
to kill every dingo
within ten miles of here 
unless you re talking about deserters 
did you know that your american indian
is a race that has no word for  wheel  
no concept of farming 
no understanding of land ownership 
is that a fact 
from what i hear  you found a solution
to that problem in your country 
i guess that depends on
whether you re an indian or not 
you see  in many ways   
our two nations are quite similar 
we both brought civilization
to the stone age 
unfortunately  in this country
we have failed in one regard 
we have been unable to domesticate
the most backward people in the world   
   the australian aborigine 
don t mind him  he s harmless 
my parents were slaughtered
by aborigines  mr  quigley 
they attacked so fast my mother
was found dead still holding her sewing 
nowadays they butcher
our sheep and cattle 
her majesty s government
allows the local settlers
to deal with the matter their own way 
it s official policy 
it s called  pacification by force  
but the real issue   
   is that  primitive as they are 
the aborigines have learned
to keep out of rifle range 
which brings us to you    mr  quigley 
what the hell 
no  stay right where you are 
no man knocks me out of my own house 
don t just stand there  get him 
  has he got the rifle with him 
  he keeps it right beside him 
i said  get him 
he s just sitting in there
with that big gun 
keep down  kelly  up there 
carver  take the side 
brophy  around the back 
fancy american shooter 
eating real fancy  eh 
go on  kick him in the back  give it
to him in the back  go on  that s it 
leave roy alone 
get her off me 
throw him in the wagon  haul him
two days from here and dump him 
let australia kill him 
and that crazy woman  too 
you forgot the gold 
what did he say 
  you forgot the gold 
  marston 
he paid him in gold 
he s right 
leave us some water
and you can have the gold 
  i can have the gold anyway 
  that s what i thought you d say 
yah 
yah 
go on 
come on  yah 
yah 
i wish people would quit
hitting me on the head 
don t worry 
on a new job  it s quite common
for things not to go well at first 
  we should   
  what 
i remember  my granddaddy told me
how  when you re lost in the desert 
you should sleep during the day
and walk at night 
your granddaddy tell you that 
he also tell you we ll die in the desert
without those horses 
what good are horses if we die first 
once in a while she actually
makes a little sense 
  what did you say  roy 
  never mind 
good morning  major 
marston 
what can i get for you 
some refreshment 
that s very kind  sir 
i d be obliged if you would
identify for me two dead bodies 
two men absconded 
but i imagine this is
a couple of newcomers
who wandered off together  recently 
a man and a woman 
two men  one has been stabbed
and one shot through the head 
coogan and miller 
it would appear that the man
and the woman are still missing 
yes  it would  wouldn t it 
don t worry  major 
i have no doubt i ll find them 
hey  lady 
you ok 
think so 
what are they gonna do to us 
i reckon they already done it 
they gave us water 
but that don t make sense 
they let me keep it when every white man
with a rifle s trying to kill  em 
  except you 
  they don t know that 
don t they 
something tells me you and i
were on the shady side of dead 
this is a special place 
bet they used magic on us 
that old man over there 
looks like he s    some kind of chief 
or medicine man  or something 
what s this  there 
more than likely something
that came out of the south end
  of a northbound kangaroo 
  you mean kangaroo shit 
very kind 
  do you think they re safe to eat 
  you got a better idea 
much obliged 
go on 
i don t eat things
that are still moving 
gonna shoot it first 
mm hmm 
  yo  yo 
  yo 
yo  yo 
yo 
after you cut this strip out
of this big piece of kangaroo   
there we go  take   
here 
swing your arm  just roll your wrist 
you gotta keep that loop open 
see how that loop stays open 
you look at what you re throwing at 
swing the rope and throw right at it 
then you just pull him in 
you just wait till you try this 
but you gotta guess what it is 
that little girl is so darling 
she sure is 
not as darling as roy junior 
god almighty  lady  not another roy 
i don t know about you  but my stomach
thinks my throat s been cut 
roy was hunting sage hens
when the comanches came 
i grabbed the baby and a pistol 
and i hid in the root cellar out back 
the indians tore up our sod house 
i was real quiet 
but then the baby started crying 
i tried to shush him and suckle him 
but he just wouldn t stop 
one comanche  i remember  he acted
real drunk and wore my green apron 
he must have heard something 
he started hollering and coming closer 
so i put my hand gentle like
over my baby s mouth 
 don t cry  daddy ll be home soon  
the indians found us 
but they just laughed 
they was drunk  didn t wanna
hurt anybody  and rode away 
at sundown  roy came home  but i was
still afraid to come out of the cellar 
i was afraid of what he d do
when he saw i d smothered our son 
i ought to find some way
to mend this petticoat  look at that 
roy   
he just buried the baby 
put me in the wagon 
and we went 70 miles
to galveston without stopping 
he never said a word 
put me on the first ship he found 
it was headed to australia 
then he said 
 don t want no woman that would
kill my son to save herself  
and he turned and he walked away 
and he never looked back 
i know   cause i watched
to see if he would 
this thing is just falling apart 
it s just   
i m tired 
don t exactly talk your ear off
saying goodbye  do they 
the johnsons were always like that 
what 
remember the church social last year 
they ate everybody s jams and pies
and left without saying a word 
it s our own fault for
inviting  em again this year 
why would they do that 
that s why 
oh  no  no 
no  stay back 
no 
over there 
no 
shit 
of all the damn fool things
i ever did see 
you trying to get your head blown off 
anyone who believes in magic   
is crazy 
don t be running off like that 
i could have used
some help up there  you know 
well  i got my rig back 
but no saddlebags 
which means i can t make my reload 
we got one horse and two canteens 
and a rider got away  which means
marston ll know where we are 
yeah  and we don t 
  i m cold 
  you got the blanket 
maybe we could share it tonight 
there s something
i wanna talk to you about 
if we do  there ll be something
i wanna talk to you about 
when summer comes  let s drag up
some wood for a real cabin 
   cause  roy  sod walls   
  matthew 
matthew quigley 
i ain t sharing my bed till i m certain
you know who s in it  now say it 
if we had a wood cabin
we could get glass windows 
we ll see 
the sea s gotta be west 
that s how we re headed 
but you sure wouldn t know it 
ow  hell 
do you see that 
i sure did  biggest ant i ever did see 
  what s my name today 
  matthew quigley 
same as any other day 
how s about you and me taking off
all our clothes and going swimming 
what are you  crazy 
there ain t no water 
why  shame on you 
well  you   
what about last night  you   
i what 
oh  never mind 
  how s that  then  mr  marston 
  pretty good  o flynn  you ve improved 
wear your holster a bit higher 
then grab your gun on the way up 
  but i m faster  aren t i 
  yeah 
  think i ll ever be as fast as you 
  you mean if you practiced a lot 
  yeah 
  no 
not again 
where are the others 
dead  all dead 
quigley  he was everywhere 
four more  i don t believe this 
did you see him 
  it was too far away 
  how far 
  three quarters of a mile  maybe 
  that s impossible 
how long from the time the bullet struck
until you heard the report of the rifle 
two  maybe three seconds 
matthew quigley is really
beginning to annoy me 
dobkin  how many men
can we send out there 
these and two others 
six men are still on a hunting party 
all right 
there s 50 pounds  in gold 
to the man who brings quigley in 
so keep practicing 
  if we re lost  you can tell me 
  we re lost 
  i can take bad news  tell me straight 
  i don t know where the hell we are 
no sense in taking time
to make it sound better than it is 
i reckon we re going in circles 
you flower things up 
i ll see right through it 
so just tell me  honestly  are we lost 
no  i know exactly where we are 
that s good   cause  frankly 
i was getting a little worried 
don t know where we re going 
but there s no use being late 
yah 
come on 
get the bloody hell outta here 
quick  come on  hurry up 
my back s broke 
your gut s shot  hobb 
there ain t nothing i can do for you 
you can kill me 
where s marston s station from here 
  how far s the nearest town 
  why should i tell you 
 cause if you don t  i ll let you live 
you know  i m new here 
so i m kinda curious 
do you think the dingoes
will get you first  or the ants 
quigley  don t leave me like this 
quigley  marston s station s
two days  ride southwest 
meekathanga s only 20 miles
past the billabong 
talk straight  goddamn it 
or i ll get the ants myself 
it s a town  a day s ride
past the dry riverbed 
that way 
now finish me 
you got one shot left in that shooter 
make the most of it 
all right  all right  sweet thing 
you re the sweetest little thing 
sweet  little thing 
i reckon we should keep moving
till we find some help 
i reckon we should stop for the night 
the baby s hurt  weak  he needs shelter 
the kid s probably tougher than we are 
that little fella
was eatin  like his bellybutton
had been rubbing a blister
on his backbone 
yeah  he was eating 
but he needs some milk 
i don t recall seeing a whole
lot of milking cows around here 
there should be a town
to the southwest 
i reckon we could make it
in a hard day s ride 
we can t make it 
he should stay here with me 
you can make the ride faster without us 
well   
just leave me
the extra rifle and pistol 
you know how to use a shooter 
i am a native born texican 
there s enough water for two days 
if i ain t here drinking it 
what do you think 
what  what s the matter 
you 
you re the only man on this continent
that would ask me what i think 
  that ought to do you 
  thanks for the lizards 
you ve checked the guns three times 
there s food and water  we re fine 
get going 
if you run into any of his own people

for two idiots to line up in his sights

what  nothing clever to say 
the great quigley 
this is what you were all afraid of 
bring him over here and stand him up 
stand up 
cut him loose 
now put his rifle   
on the ground in front of him 
no 
throw it away 
o flynn  go and get my second revolver 
i know how much you d like to have
your rifle with you  at this moment 
but i think you ll find that
i ve got a much better idea 
stick it in his belt  go on 
i seem to remember you re not too
familiar with colonel colt s revolver 
so this will be your first lesson 
don t worry  mr  dobkin and mr  o flynn
will ensure that it s a fair contest 
i ll just back up a few paces 
and to your left a bit  that s it

of my old pistol target 
some men are born in the wrong century 
i think i was born
on the wrong continent 
oh  by the way  you re fired 
this ain t dodge city 
and you ain t bill hickok 
i said i never had much use for one 
never said i didn t know how to use it 
somewhat the worse for wear   
this appears to be quigley 
i think you have a lot to explain  sir 
not that it will do you
any good  sergeant 
in pursuance of a warrant 
duly attested by a justice of the peace 
you are hereby charged with numerous
and serious crimes  including murder   
in short  this paperwork says   
   that we can hang you 
i ain t gonna swing on no gallows 
well 
you can always be shot   
on the way to your trial 
while trying to escape  of course 
or you can die right here 
bearing arms against the army
of her majesty the queen
