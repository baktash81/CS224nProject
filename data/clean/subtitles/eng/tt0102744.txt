who have been run out
of their own barbaric country

for the last two days
things seem different here
they say god made australia last

everything else the same

what weve got for you
matthew quigley
elliott marston welcome to australia
well sir your men already welcomed me
coogan mr quigleys luggage
take it to the lodge
mr marston you said youd
pay me 50 dollars in gold coin
just for showing up
you dont waste much time
i spent three months on a boat
just gettin here
you intrigued me mr quigley
twentyone men answered my
advertisement from all over the world
canada india england
they just wrote letters
but you had a way with words
my advertisement stated that i wanted to
hire the finest marksman in the world
have i
uhhuh
the legendary sharp
you know your weapons
its a leveraction breech loader
usual barrel lengths 30 inches
this one has an extra four
its converted to use a special
45caliber 110grain metal cartridge
with a 540grain paperpatched bullet
its fitted with double set triggers
and a vernier sight
its marked up to 1200 yards
this one shoots a mite further
an experimental weapon
with experimental ammunition
you could call it that
lets experiment
whitey take that bucket
and ride out until i signal
tell me when you want him to stop
your man able to hit
something that far away
i dont know him
i never saw him before
hed have to be a good shot all right
bout therell do
bullshit
are you quite certain mr quigley
that you wouldnt like
the bucket a bit closer
jesus christ
quite certain
told you only my roy could
hit a coyote from that distance
very impressive youre hired
would you excuse me for a minute
theres some business
i have to attend to
you might find this interesting
nice shootin roy
mr marston
i think theres been a mistake
the one they call crazy cora
id appreciate it
if your men leave her alone
till you and i have a chance to talk
whatever you want
you are deserters from
her majestys armed forces
the penalty for your crime is death
you were caught on my land
i could have you shot for trespassing
look you let us stay here
guvnor well serve you proper
better than this
convict scum youve got
well unfortunately your commanding
officer major ashleypitt and i
have an understanding
and so im afraid
youll be sent back
to face the firing party
but i see no reason why you
should be trussed up like animals
mr dobkin
this is my preferred weapon
mr quigley
do join me for dinner
youve got to admit the yanks
a damn good shot with a long rifle
oh sure but you give me
a weapon like that
and i could beat him with my eyes shut
easy to say oflynn
youve got a lot to learn
i aint got a lot to learn look at you
dobkin youve been here 12 years
and all youve got to show for it
is cold mutton
hes in getting a fancy dinner
huh
you were actually in dodge city
william hickok must have been there
spent a night there once
i was pretty tired
dodge citys a nice place
to get some sleep
are you familiar with
the army revolver mr quigley
well sir i never had much use for one
its a recent invention of
your countryman colonel colt
god created all men they say
sam colt made em equal more or less
thats what i like about you americans
youre people of action not words
that mint jelly on your lamb
its my own creation
no im a student of your american west
ive read a great deal about it
tell me about dingoes
ten pounds a month
for shooting wild dogs
seems like a whole lot for not much
besides you got enough men
and guns outside
to kill every dingo
within ten miles of here
unless youre talking about deserters
did you know that your american indian
is a race that has no word for wheel
no concept of farming
no understanding of land ownership
is that a fact
from what i hear you found a solution
to that problem in your country
i guess that depends on
whether youre an indian or not
you see in many ways
our two nations are quite similar
we both brought civilization
to the stone age
unfortunately in this country
we have failed in one regard
we have been unable to domesticate
the most backward people in the world
the australian aborigine
dont mind him hes harmless
my parents were slaughtered
by aborigines mr quigley
they attacked so fast my mother
was found dead still holding her sewing
nowadays they butcher
our sheep and cattle
her majestys government
allows the local settlers
to deal with the matter their own way
its official policy
its called pacification by force
but the real issue
is that primitive as they are
the aborigines have learned
to keep out of rifle range
which brings us to you mr quigley
what the hell
no stay right where you are
no man knocks me out of my own house
dont just stand there get him
has he got the rifle with him
he keeps it right beside him
i said get him
hes just sitting in there
with that big gun
keep down kelly up there
carver take the side
brophy around the back
fancy american shooter
eating real fancy eh
go on kick him in the back give it
to him in the back go on thats it
leave roy alone
get her off me
throw him in the wagon haul him
two days from here and dump him
let australia kill him
and that crazy woman too
you forgot the gold
what did he say
you forgot the gold
marston
he paid him in gold
hes right
leave us some water
and you can have the gold
i can have the gold anyway
thats what i thought youd say
yah
yah
go on
come on yah
yah
i wish people would quit
hitting me on the head
dont worry
on a new job its quite common
for things not to go well at first
we should
what
i remember my granddaddy told me
how when youre lost in the desert
you should sleep during the day
and walk at night
your granddaddy tell you that
he also tell you well die in the desert
without those horses
what good are horses if we die first
once in a while she actually
makes a little sense
what did you say roy
never mind
good morning major
marston
what can i get for you
some refreshment
thats very kind sir
id be obliged if you would
identify for me two dead bodies
two men absconded
but i imagine this is
a couple of newcomers
who wandered off together recently
a man and a woman
two men one has been stabbed
and one shot through the head
coogan and miller
it would appear that the man
and the woman are still missing
yes it would wouldnt it
dont worry major
i have no doubt ill find them
hey lady
you ok
think so
what are they gonna do to us
i reckon they already done it
they gave us water
but that dont make sense
they let me keep it when every white man
with a rifles trying to kill em
except you
they dont know that
dont they
something tells me you and i
were on the shady side of dead
this is a special place
bet they used magic on us
that old man over there
looks like hes some kind of chief
or medicine man or something
whats this there
more than likely something
that came out of the south end
of a northbound kangaroo
you mean kangaroo shit
very kind
do you think theyre safe to eat
you got a better idea
much obliged
go on
i dont eat things
that are still moving
gonna shoot it first
mmhmm
yo yo
yo
yo yo
yo
after you cut this strip out
of this big piece of kangaroo
there we go take
here
swing your arm just roll your wrist
you gotta keep that loop open
see how that loop stays open
you look at what youre throwing at
swing the rope and throw right at it
then you just pull him in
you just wait till you try this
but you gotta guess what it is
that little girl is so darling
she sure is
not as darling as roy junior
god almighty lady not another roy
i dont know about you but my stomach
thinks my throats been cut
roy was hunting sage hens
when the comanches came
i grabbed the baby and a pistol
and i hid in the root cellar out back
the indians tore up our sod house
i was real quiet
but then the baby started crying
i tried to shush him and suckle him
but he just wouldnt stop
one comanche i remember he acted
real drunk and wore my green apron
he must have heard something
he started hollering and coming closer
so i put my hand gentlelike
over my babys mouth
dont cry daddyll be home soon
the indians found us
but they just laughed
they was drunk didnt wanna
hurt anybody and rode away
at sundown roy came home but i was
still afraid to come out of the cellar
i was afraid of what hed do
when he saw id smothered our son
i ought to find some way
to mend this petticoat look at that
roy
he just buried the baby
put me in the wagon
and we went 70 miles
to galveston without stopping
he never said a word
put me on the first ship he found
it was headed to australia
then he said
dont want no woman that would
kill my son to save herself
and he turned and he walked away
and he never looked back
i know cause i watched
to see if he would
this thing is just falling apart
its just
im tired
dont exactly talk your ear off
saying goodbye do they
the johnsons were always like that
what
remember the church social last year
they ate everybodys jams and pies
and left without saying a word
its our own fault for
inviting em again this year
why would they do that
thats why
oh no no
no stay back
no
over there
no
shit
of all the damn fool things
i ever did see
you trying to get your head blown off
anyone who believes in magic
is crazy
dont be running off like that
i could have used
some help up there you know
well i got my rig back
but no saddlebags
which means i cant make my reload
we got one horse and two canteens
and a rider got away which means
marstonll know where we are
yeah and we dont
im cold
you got the blanket
maybe we could share it tonight
theres something
i wanna talk to you about
if we do therell be something
i wanna talk to you about
when summer comes lets drag up
some wood for a real cabin
cause roy sod walls
matthew
matthew quigley
i aint sharing my bed till im certain
you know whos in it now say it
if we had a wood cabin
we could get glass windows
well see
the seas gotta be west
thats how were headed
but you sure wouldnt know it
ow hell
do you see that
i sure did biggest ant i ever did see
whats my name today
matthew quigley

you mean if you practiced a lot
yeah
no

where are the others
dead all dead
quigley he was everywhere
four more i dont believe this
did you see him
it was too far away
how far
three quarters of a mile maybe
thats impossible
how long from the time the bullet struck
until you heard the report of the rifle
two maybe three seconds
matthew quigley is really
beginning to annoy me
dobkin how many men
can we send out there
these and two others
six men are still on a hunting party
all right
theres 50 pounds in gold
to the man who brings quigley in
so keep practicing
if were lost you can tell me
were lost
i can take bad news tell me straight
i dont know where the hell we are
no sense in taking time
to make it sound better than it is
i reckon were going in circles
you flower things up
ill see right through it
so just tell me honestly are we lost
no i know exactly where we are
thats good cause frankly
i was getting a little worried
dont know where were going
but theres no use being late
yah
come on
get the bloody hell outta here
quick come on hurry up
my backs broke
your guts shot hobb
there aint nothing i can do for you
you can kill me

the babys hurt weak he needs shelter
the kids probably tougher than we are
that little fella
was eatin like his bellybutton
had been rubbing a blister
on his backbone
yeah he was eating
but he needs some milk
i dont recall seeing a whole
lot of milking cows around here
there should be a town
to the southwest

in a hard days ride
we cant make it
he should stay here with me
you can make the ride faster without us
well

the extra rifle and pistol
you know how to use a shooter
i am a nativeborn texican

there are two men at the front

scottys riding up
to patrol to the ridge
mr marston the men were wondering
if the man who kills quigley
will get the 200 pounds in gold
the reward you posted
who asked you about it
cavanagh
have cavanagh guard the front porch
tell him to wear my coat and hat
marston hes around the back
what the hell is he doing
emptying his revolver he wants it
freshly loaded for the night
do you think hes losing his cabbage
maybe scottys got quigley
anyone can leave safely before dawn
except marston
most cordially matthew quigley
he must think im stupid
this means hes gonna try and spring
something on us during the night
all right nobody sleeps
give me that
stay awake
marston
mr marston
theyre gone
what
three men ran off giniven kelly
why the hell didnt you stop them
where is he
hes gotta be way up there
in the cutting
so much for cavanaghs reward
that bastards been sitting waiting
for two idiots to line up in his sights
all right
well do the last
thing quigley expects
come on
hes cleared out
lets get back to the station
get up there
ya
ya
im hurt quigley
ill do you no harm
you throw that hogleg away easy
on your feet
jesus
brophy get round to the side there
make it harder for him ill cover you
this rocks covering me fine
move you gutless bloody wonder
close in on him
brophy
i can bounce the next one
clean through ya how brave are ya
im coming out
that aint real brave but it is smart
i got him i got quigley
got a gift for you mr marston
quigley alive
well half alive
good work you two
well well well
mr quigley
good of you to drop in again
what nothing clever to say
the great quigley
this is what you were all afraid of
bring him over here and stand him up
stand up
cut him loose
now put his rifle
on the ground in front of him
no
throw it away
oflynn go and get my second revolver
i know how much youd like to have
your rifle with you at this moment
but i think youll find that
ive got a much better idea
stick it in his belt go on
i seem to remember youre not too
familiar with colonel colts revolver
so this will be your first lesson
dont worry mr dobkin and mr oflynn
will ensure that its a fair contest
ill just back up a few paces
and to your left a bit thats it
now youre right in front
of my old pistol target
some men are born in the wrong century
i think i was born
on the wrong continent
oh by the way youre fired
this aint dodge city
and you aint bill hickok
i said i never had much use for one
never said i didnt know how to use it
somewhat the worse for wear
this appears to be quigley
i think you have a lot to explain sir
not that it will do you
any good sergeant
in pursuance of a warrant
duly attested by a justice of the peace
you are hereby charged with numerous
and serious crimes including murder
in short this paperwork says
that we can hang you
i aint gonna swing on no gallows
well
you can always be shot
on the way to your trial
while trying to escape of course
or you can die right here
bearing arms against the army
of her majesty the queen
the decision
all right come on
whens the next boat leaving
for europe or the americas
america

this afternoon for san francisco
