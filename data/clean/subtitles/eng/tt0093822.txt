for a pretty thing like you 
short for edwina  turn to the right 
you re a flower  you are 
just a little desert flower 
let me know how those come out 
now  prison life is verystructured   
more than mostpeople care for 
but a spirit ofcomradery
exists between the men
iike you find only in combat  maybe 
or on a pro ball club
in the heat ofthe pennant drive 
in an effort to better ourselves 
we had to meet with a counsellor 
who tried to help us figure out
why we were the way we were 
and all pancho wanted
was a hot roll and butter 
so    why do you use the word  trapped  
  huh 
  why do you say you feel  trapped 
in a man s body 
well  sometimes i get
the menstrual cramps real hard 
  have you learned anything  hi 
  yes  sir  you bet 
  you wouldn t lie to us  would you  hi 
  no  ma am  hope to say

i can tsayl was happy to be back inside 
but the flood offamiliarsights  sounds and
faces almostmade itfeellike a homecomin  
most men your age are getting married
and raising up a family 
  well  factually   
  they wouldn t accept prison as a substitute 
would any ofyou men care to comment 
well  sometimes your career s
gotta come before family 
work s what s kept us happy 
i tried to sort through
what doc schwartz hadsaid 
but prison ain t the easiestplace to think 
and when there was no meat  we ate fowl 
and when there was no fowl  we ate crawdad 
and when there was no crawdad
to be found  we ate san  
  you ate what 
  we ate san  
  you ate sand 
  that s right 
well  hi  you done served your 20 months 
and seein  as how you never use live ammo 
we got no choice but to return you to society 
  these doors are gonna swing wide 
  i didn t wanna hurt anyone  sir 
  hi  we respect that 
  but you re just hurting yourself
  with this rambunctious behaviour 
  i know that  sir 
ok  then 
i don tknowhowyou come down
on the incarceration question 
whether it s forrehabilitation orrevenge 
but i was beginning to think revenge
is the onlyargumentmakes anysense 
show the tattoo 
  turn to the right 
  don t forget his fingers  ed 
hear about the paddy wagon
collided with the cement mixer  ed 
twelve hardened criminals escaped 
i heard that one 
  got a new beau 
  no  hi  i sure don t 
don t worry  i paid for it 
they say thatabsence
makes the heartgrowfonder 
and  for once  theymaybe right 
you missed a spot 
more andmore my thoughts turned to ed
and lfinally felt the pain ofimprisonment 
mama would throw the live crawdad
in a pan of boilin  water 
well  one day i decided
to make my own crawdad 
and i threw it in a pot 
without the water  you see 
and it was just like makin  popcorn  you see 
yeah  thejoint s a lonelyplace
after lockup andlights out 
when the last ofthe cons
has been sweptawayby the sandman 
but i couldn thelp thinkin 
that a brighterfuture layahead 
a future that was only
eight to fourteen months away 
they got a name for people like you  hi 
  that name is called  recidivism  
  repeat offender 
  not a pretty name  is it  hi 
  no  sir  that s one bonehead name 
  but that ain t me any more 
  are you just tellin  us what we wanna hear 
  no  sir  no way 
  cos we just wanna hear the truth 
well  then i guess i am
tellin  you what you wanna hear 
  boy  didn t we just tell you not to do that 
  yes  sir 
ok  then

i m walkin  in here on my knees 
ed  a free man  proposin  
howdy  curt 
  andso it was 
  don t forget the bouquet  ed 
  i do 
  you bet i do 
ok  then 
ed s pa staked us to a starterhome
in suburban tempe
and lgotajob drillin holes in sheetmetal 
so we were doin  paramedical work
with the state highway system 
not actually practisin   you understand 
me and bill s patrollin  down nine mile   
  bill roberts 
  no  not that mother scratcher  bill parker 
anyway  we re approachin  the wreck
and there s this spherical object
restin  in the highway 
and it s not a piece o  the car 
most ways  thejob was a lotlike prison 
except ed was waitin at the end ofevery day
and a pay cheque at the end ofevery week 
government do take a bite  don t she 
these were the happy days 
the salad days  as theysay 
and edfelt thathavin a critter
was the nextlogicalstep 
it was allshe thoughtabout 
her point was that there was too much
love andbeautyforjust the two ofus 
every day we kepta child out ofthe world
was a dayhe mightlaterregrethavin missed 
that was beautiful 
so we workedatit on the days
we calculatedmostlikely to be fruitful 
and we workedatit
most other days just to be sure 
ed rejoiced thatmylawless years were behind
me and that our child rearingyears layahead 
and then the roofcavedin 
hi    i m barren 
at firstl didn tbelieve it 
that this woman  who lookedas fertile as
the tennessee valley  couldnotbear children 
but the doctor explained that
her insides were a rockyplace
where myseed couldfindno purchase 
ed was inconsolable 
we triedan adoption agency 
it s true that hi has had a chequered past 
but ed here is an officer ofthe law twice
decorated  so we figure it kinda evens out 
but biologyand the prejudices ofothers
conspired to keep us childless 
our love for each other
was stronger than ever 
but lpreminisced   
no return ofthe salad days 
the pizzazz hadgone out ofourlives 
ed lostall interestin both
criminaljustice andhousekeepin  
soon after  she tenderedherbadge 
even myjob seemedas dry
and bitteras a hotprairie wind 
so here s bill  walkin  down nine mile   
that s bill parker  you understand

and a fuckin  head in the other

befoulin  even the sweet desertbreeze
that whippedacross his brow 
i didn tknow where he came from or why 
i didn tknowifhe was dream or vision

seems pretty clear what the situation is here 
yeah 
i guess the missis wants us to clear out 
now  h l  ifyou ll pardon me for sayin  so 
  i get the feelin  that this ain t workin  out 
  edwina s generally a real sweetheart 
and  as per usual  i wouldn t be surprised
if the source of
the marital friction weren t financial 
as a matter offact  i did lose myjob today 
hi  you re young and you got your health 
what you want with ajob 
but i d rather light a candle
than curse your darkness 
now  as you know  evelle here and i never
go anywhere without there s a purpose 
and here we are in your little domicile 
  we come to invite you in on a little score 
  a bank  h l 
come on now 
i know you re partial to
convenience stores  but dammit  h l 
the sun don t rise and set
on the corner grocery 
it s like doc schwartz says 
you gotta have a little bit of ambition 
we just watchin  on the news  somebody
snatched up one ofthem arizona babies 
  for chrissakes 
  that there s somebody who s thinkin  big 
and here you are  sittin  on your butt  playin 
house with a   don t get me wrong  h i  
with a fine woman  but a woman
who needs one ofthem button down types 
  i don t particularly think that s any ofyour   
  hold on  h l  now lookee there 
that s a picture of ei dorado 
the locals call it the farmers
and mechanics bank of la grange 
looks like a hayseed bank 
tell you the truth  it is a hayseed bank 
but the last friday of every financial quarter 
it has more cash than flies at a barbecue 
  and guess what day it is tomorrow 
  when all the hayseeds come in and
cash their farm subsidies cheques 
  a1 information  hi 
  got it in the joint
from a guy named lawrence spivey  one of
dick nixon s undersecretary of agricultures 
in for soliciting sex from a state trooper 
ordinarily we don t associate
with that type of person  but   
he was tryin  to make a few brownie points 
boys  i can t 
hi  we need someone handy with
a scatter gun  coverin  them hayseeds 
while we go in there and get that cash 
you understand  h l  lfthis works out 
it s just the beginning of a spree
to cover the entire southwest  and we keep
goin  until we can retire    or we get caught 
either way  we re fixed for life 
boys  it s a kind offer  but   
you re suggesting i just up and leave ed 
and that d be pretty
damn cowardly  wouldn t it 
would it  think about it  h l 
seems to me sittin  here
you ain t doin  her any good 
and you ain t bein  true to your own nature 
my dearestedwina

even if mrs arizona had
more than she could handle 
i was a police officer  sworn to uphold
the constitution ofthe united states 
  now  honey  you resigned before we ever   
  that ain t the point  hi 
we don t deserve nathan junior

that hayseed over there
with the red hat  he s the monitor 
ok  you betcha 
i want you to stay flat for ten full minutes 
we mightjust come back in five to check 
that s for us to know and for y all to find out 
anyone found bipedal in five
wears his ass for a hat 
that old timer threw off my concentration 
otherwise it would have gone smoother 
shoot  gale  we done good 
this oughta split up real nice three ways 
goddammit  you never leave a man behind 
  where s the baby 
  where s the baby 
dammit  h l  ain t we got
enough to contend with 
i don t know  ma am  i thought we left him
up on the roof  i think we left him at the bank 
ms mcdunnough  i m worried sick about him 
  hold on  h l 
  i m worried sick about him 
  hi 
  h l 
  hi 
  ms mcdunnough 
  let us come with you 
  please 
he s our baby too 
  what is he 
  do you see him too 
gimme that baby 
i want that baby 
gimme that baby  you warthog from hell 
just lay down on the floor  young missy 
  run along now  honey 
  but hi   
just run along now 
i    i didn t   
i m sorry 
what the hell s goin  on 
get away from there 
  let s go 
  wait a minute  i ain t through with you 
what are you doin 
creepin  around in the dark 
  you in with smalls 
  excuse me 
leonard smalls  big feller  rides a harley 
dresses like a rock star 
no  sir  that s who we saved him from 
  it s a long story 
  suppose you tell it 
well  sir  in a reward situation 
they usually say  no questions asked  
  do they 
  yeah 
well   
all right  boy 
i guess you got a reward comin  
 25 000 
or  ifyou need home furnishings  i can
give you a line of credit at any of my stores 
in fact  that s the way
i d rather handle it  for tax reasons 
we don t want no reward 
we didn t bring him back for money 
we could work it that way too 
could i just look at him a little bit more 
be my guest  little lady 
but   
would you mind tellin  me exactly how you   
you took him  didn t you 
it wasn t that biker at all 
i took him  sir 
my wife had nothin  to do with it 
  i crept in yon window and   
  we both did it 
we didn t wanna hurt him any 
i just wanted to be a mama 
it wasn t for money or nothin  
we just figured you had more
than you could handle baby wise 
but i m the one committed the actual crime 
so ifyou need to call the authorities   
shut up  nobody s gonna call
the authorities ifthere s no harm done 
  thank you  sir 
  aw  bullshit 
just tell me why you did it 
we   
can t have one of our own 
well  look   
if you can t have kids 
you just gotta keep tryin 
and hope medical science catches
up with you  like florence and me 
it caught up with a vengeance 
but  hell  even if it never does for you 
you still got each other 
sir  those are kind words  but   
i think the wife and i are splittin  up 
her point is that we re both
kinda selfish and unrealistic 
so we ain t too good for each other 
well  ma am  i don t know much 
but i do know human beings 
you brought back my boy 
so you must have your good points too 
i sure hate to think of florence leavin  me 
i do    iove her so 
you can go out the way you came in 
and before you go off and do
another foolish thing  like bustin  up 
i suggest you sleep on it 
at least one night 
that nightlhada dream 
i dreamtl was as lightas the ether 
a floatin spirit  visitin  things to come 
the shades andshadows ofthe people
in mylife wrestled their wayinto myslumber 
i dreamt that gale andevelle had decided to
return to prison  probably that sjustas well 
i don tmean to soundsuperior 
and they re a swell coupla guys 
but maybe they weren treadyyet
to come outinto the world 
and then i dreamed on  into the future 
to a christmas morning in the arizona home 
where nathan junior was openin a present
from a kindly couple
who preferred to remain unknown 
i saw glen a fewyears later 
still havin no luck gettin  the cops
to listen to his wild tales aboutme anded 
maybe he threwin one polackjoke too many 
i don tknow 
but stiill dreamed on 
further into the future
than i d ever dreamedbefore 
watchin  nathan junior s progress from afar 
takin  pride in his accomplishments 
as ifhe were our own 
wonderin  ifhe ever thought ofus 
and hopin  thatmaybe we d
broadened his horizons a little 
even ifhe couldn tremember
just how theygotbroadened 
but stiillhadn t dreamt
nothin  aboutme anded 
until the end 
and this was cloudier 
because it was years  years away 
but lsawan old couple
bein  visitedby their children
and all theirgrandchildren too 
the old couple weren tscrewed up 
and neither were theirkids or theirgrandkids 
dad   
and i don tknow 
you tellme 
this whole dream 
was it wishful thinkin  
was ljustfleein reality 
like lknowl m liable to do 
but me anded  we can be good too 
and itseemedreal 
it seemedlike us 
and itseemedlike 
well    ourhome 
ifnotarizona  then a landnot too faraway 
where allparents are
