now prison life is verystructured
more than mostpeople care for
but a spirit ofcomradery
exists between the men
iike you find only in combat maybe
or on a pro ball club
in the heat ofthe pennant drive
in an effort to better ourselves
we had to meet with a counsellor
who tried to help us figure out
why we were the way we were
and all pancho wanted
was a hot roll and butter
so why do you use the word trapped
huh
why do you say you feel trapped
in a mans body
well sometimes i get
the menstrual cramps real hard

ill be waitin
i cantsayl was happy to be back inside
but the flood offamiliarsights sounds and
faces almostmade itfeellike a homecomin
most men your age are getting married
and raising up a family
well factually
they wouldnt accept prison as a substitute
would any ofyou men care to comment
well sometimes your careers
gotta come before family
works whats kept us happy
i tried to sort through
what doc schwartz hadsaid
but prison aint the easiestplace to think
and when there was no meat we ate fowl
and when there was no fowl we ate crawdad
and when there was no crawdad
to be found we ate san
you ate what
we ate san
you ate sand
thats right
well hi you done served your 20 months
and seein as how you never use live ammo
we got no choice but to return you to society
these doors are gonna swing wide
i didnt wanna hurt anyone sir
hi we respect that
but youre just hurting yourself
with this rambunctious behaviour
i know that sir

i dontknowhowyou come down
on the incarceration question
whether its forrehabilitation orrevenge
but i was beginning to think revenge
is the onlyargumentmakes anysense

collided with the cement mixer ed
twelve hardened criminals escaped
i heard that one
got a new beau
no hi i sure dont
dont worry i paid for it
they say thatabsence
makes the heartgrowfonder
and for once theymaybe right
you missed a spot
more andmore my thoughts turned to ed
and lfinally felt the pain ofimprisonment
mama would throw the live crawdad
in a pan of boilin water
well one day i decided
to make my own crawdad
and i threw it in a pot
without the water you see
and it was just like makin popcorn you see
yeah thejoints a lonelyplace
after lockup andlights out
when the last ofthe cons
has been sweptawayby the sandman
but i couldnthelp thinkin
that a brighterfuture layahead
a future that was only
eight to fourteen months away
they got a name for people like you hi
that name is called recidivism
repeat offender
not a pretty name is it hi
no sir thats one bonehead name
but that aint me any more

howdy curt
andso it was
dont forget the bouquet ed
i do
you bet i do
ok then
eds pa staked us to a starterhome
in suburban tempe
and lgotajob drillinholes in sheetmetal
so we were doin paramedical work
with the state highway system
not actually practisin you understand
me and bills patrollin down nine mile
bill roberts
no not that motherscratcher bill parker
anyway were approachin the wreck
and theres this spherical object
restin in the highway
and its not a piece o the car
most ways thejob was a lotlike prison
except ed was waitinat the end ofevery day
and a pay cheque at the end ofevery week
government do take a bite dont she
these were the happy days
the salad days as theysay
and edfelt thathavina critter
was the nextlogicalstep
it was allshe thoughtabout
her point was that there was too much
love andbeautyforjust the two ofus
every day we kepta child out ofthe world
was a dayhe mightlaterregrethavinmissed
that was beautiful
so we workedatit on the days
we calculatedmostlikely to be fruitful
and we workedatit
most other daysjust to be sure
ed rejoiced thatmylawless years were behind
me and that our childrearingyears layahead
and then the roofcavedin
hi im barren
at firstl didntbelieve it
that this woman who lookedas fertile as
the tennessee valley couldnotbear children
but the doctor explained that
her insides were a rockyplace
where myseed couldfindno purchase
ed was inconsolable
we triedan adoption agency
its true that hi has had a chequered past
but ed here is an officer ofthe law twice
decorated so we figure it kinda evens out
but biologyand the prejudices ofothers
conspired to keep us childless
our love for each other
was stronger than ever
but lpreminisced
no return ofthe salad days
the pizzazz hadgone out ofourlives
ed lostall interestin both
criminaljustice andhousekeepin
soon after she tenderedherbadge
even myjob seemedas dry
and bitteras a hotprairie wind
so heres bill walkin down nine mile
thats bill parker you understand
hes got his sandwich in one hand
and a fuckin head in the other
i even caughtmyself
drivin by convenience stores
that werent on the wayhome

just run along now
i i didnt
im sorry
what the hells goin on
get away from there
lets go
wait a minute i aint through with you
what are you doin
creepin around in the dark
you in with smalls
excuse me
leonard smalls big feller rides a harley
dresses like a rock star
no sir thats who we saved him from
its a long story
suppose you tell it
well sir in a reward situation
they usually say no questions asked
do they
yeah
well
all right boy
i guess you got a reward comin
or ifyou need home furnishings i can
give you a line of credit at any of my stores
in fact thats the way
id rather handle it for tax reasons
we dont want no reward
we didnt bring him back for money
we could work it that way too
could i just look at him a little bit more
be my guest little lady
but
would you mind tellin me exactly how you
you took him didnt you
it wasnt that biker at all
i took him sir
my wife had nothin to do with it
i crept in yon window and
we both did it
we didnt wanna hurt him any
i just wanted to be a mama
it wasnt for money or nothin
we just figured you had more
than you could handle babywise
but im the one committed the actual crime
so ifyou need to call the authorities
shut up nobodys gonna call
the authorities iftheres no harm done
thank you sir
aw bullshit
just tell me why you did it
we
cant have one of our own
well look
if you cant have kids
you just gotta keep tryin
and hope medical science catches
up with you like florence and me
it caught up with a vengeance
but hell even if it never does for you
you still got each other
sir those are kind words but
i think the wife and i are splittin up
her point is that were both
kinda selfish and unrealistic
so we aint too good for each other
well maam i dont know much
but i do know human beings
you brought back my boy
so you must have your good points too
i sure hate to think of florence leavin me
i do iove her so
you can go out the way you came in
and before you go off and do
another foolish thing like bustin up
i suggest you sleep on it
at least one night
that nightlhada dream
i dreamtl was as lightas the ether
a floatinspirit visitin things to come
the shades andshadows ofthe people
in mylife wrestled their wayinto myslumber
i dreamt that gale andevelle had decided to
return to prison probably thatsjustas well
i dontmean to soundsuperior
and theyre a swell coupla guys
but maybe they werentreadyyet
to come outinto the world
and then i dreamed on into the future
to a christmas morning in the arizona home
where nathan junior was openina present
from a kindly couple
who preferred to remain unknown
i saw glen a fewyears later
still havinno luck gettin the cops
to listen to his wild tales aboutme anded
maybe he threwin one polackjoke too many
i dontknow
but stiill dreamed on
further into the future
than id ever dreamedbefore
watchin nathan juniors progress from afar
takin pride in his accomplishments
as ifhe were our own
wonderin ifhe ever thought ofus
and hopin thatmaybe wed
broadened his horizons a little
even ifhe couldntremember
just how theygotbroadened
but stiillhadnt dreamt
nothin aboutme anded
until the end
and this was cloudier
because it was years years away
but lsawan old couple
bein visitedby their children
and all theirgrandchildren too
the old couple werentscrewed up
and neither were theirkids or theirgrandkids
dad
and i dontknow
you tellme
this whole dream
was it wishful thinkin
was ljustfleeinreality
like lknowlm liable to do
but me anded we can be good too
and itseemedreal
it seemedlike us
and itseemedlike
well ourhome
ifnotarizona then a landnot too faraway
where allparents are
