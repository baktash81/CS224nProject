born during
an electrical storm 
the atmosphere charged
with electrostatic power 
i am now able to
withstand thousands   
   upon thousands of volts
as they will course
through my body

with an executioner s hood

and they get real scared 
they think maybe
you re gonna die 
and boom  you got them 
they re back on their heels

of anything around here

but not in front of these kind folks 
please  sir 
nobody leaves 
thank you 
thank you 
my name is stanton carlisle 
marshal judd  and my family s scot 
scots are gifted with what the old
folks used to call  second sight  
now  it s clear to me 
for example 
that you are a man
who is generally distrustful 
but also fiercely loyal 
i d say that s a
fair description 
and  uh  this is
none of my business
because i know that you are capable
of handling your own affairs
and anything else liable to come
along  but i do sense a childhood
marred in disease 
and it makes you  uh 
feel hemmed in by it 
trapped  even to this day 
and i sense a curio
of some kind 
an amulet  a memento 
you carry it on your person 
you had it for a long time 
who s mary 
a saintly woman 
my    my mother 
may i see it 
may i see it  sir 
yes 
she wants you to know
that your ailment has not
shunned you from greatness 
quite the contrary 
your community loves you and
feels protected by you  sir 
and yes  you couldn t serve
your country on foreign soil 
but you protect us
here at home 
and this medal 
this medal should be a
reminder of her love for you 
and as long as
you just keep it here 
close to your heart 
where our lord jesus christ resides 
it s gonna protect you
in the future 
and she wants you
to know this  sir 
it s only by being merciful to
others that a man has true power 
but once i copped the
warrant off that deputy 
i saw the marshal s name 
i knew it was
a lead pipe cinch 
you know what s funny 
pete used to always say 
 it s not the clothes 
but the shoes
 that could tell you
everything you need to know
   about a man  
  right 
and he had a lift
in his right shoe 
and i bet you he had polio
or something as a kid 
you know  the military never
letting him in  mama s boy 
i could tell by
the look in his eyes 
that s good 
well  it takes one
to know one 
he tried to railroad us  clem 
with that
fancy moustache 
i saw that chain
around his neck 
i got it out of him 
saint christopher medal 
all that bible talk 
i thought  well 
he must know somebody named mary 
right 
and lo and behold 
the lord blessed us 
his mother s
name s mary 
you had him 
molly

well  it seems
it s a night of gold 
a golden handbag 
be quiet  child 
let me ask the questions 
what is inside the bag 
madam 
what is the meaning
of this 
you say you re genuine and i say you use
verbal signals of some sort to communicate
between the two of you 
there are no
tricks involved  madam 
there s no
deception whatsoever 
then answer me 
what is inside the bag 
the usual s inside that bag 
lipstick  a handkerchief 
oh  well  that is easy
enough  is it not 
ladies and gentlemen 
i have never met this
woman before 
nor have i any prior knowledge to the
contents of that purse  and yet   
yet  there is something
very interesting in there 
a small pistol 
nickel plated 
ivory handle 
may i 
you claim to carry it to
defend yourself  but   
i think you do it
because you like it 
i think you do it because
it makes you feel powerful 
well  madam 
you are not powerful 
not powerful enough 
you are an only child 
are you not 
your mother died
when you were young 
her shadow looms large and
close  too close for comfort 
hardly a day went by
in which she didn t
crush you down in small ways 
and that gun 
that gun in your purse  well 
sometimes you have dark thoughts
about yourself  don t you 
well 
don t you 
are your initials  ck  
yes 
have you suffered a loss 
a dear one  not long ago 
oh  god  julian 
go on 
he s   
he s right beside you 
his hand is resting
on your right shoulder 
can you feel it 
yes  he wants you
to know something 
he wants you to know how
proud he is of you  and how   
what was that about 
i do not know 
that was something else 
see the way
that woman came after me 
i saw the way you went
after her and then the man 
what are you talking about 
we were behind the eight 
i got us out 
and why did you
keep on her  then 
well  i had to 
crowd would ve turned on us 
once she came after me 
i had to take her down 
why are you so concerned 
i gave you the initials
of that watch
and you turned it
into a goddamn spook show 
molly  did you see
the same show that i did 
that crowd was
on its feet 
when was the last time
that happened 
i mean  we give them mentalism
and they treat it
like it s a dog walking on its hind
legs  but that  that was different 
we should leave that
in the show 
stan  that woman was sitting at the
same table as that poor  old man
and i ve seen
her here before

how did you know
i had a pistol 
i can read
a mark quick 
find out what they want 
and i m a mark  am i 
what do i want 
to be found out 
same as everybody else 
is that it 
think out things that most people
want  hit  em where they live   
health  wealth  love 
find out what they re afraid
of and sell it back to them 
as long as
you don t oversell it 
you wanna know
how i knew about the gun 
i removed the blindfold
both for dramatic effect
and to get a rise
out of the audience 
but also to see the way
you held your clutch 
elbow bent forward 
clutch was heavy 
and you lifted it with your
left  no wedding ring 
no tan mark  unmarried 
so  you like to go
out at night 
you were at the copa
so you got the bees 
but i assume you like to go to
lower places  too  don t you 
if i want mud on my skirt 
i can find it 
well  you live alone 
no man in the house 
gotta have a gun at home 
but you assume yourself to be a
lady  so not a big pipe 
something small  portable   22 
 25  four  six shot  maybe 
and since you like pretty things 
nickel plated  ivory handle 
but you talked
about my mother

big deal in this town  is he

big dent in this town

worth your while

if that s okay 
we can go much deeper
if you do 
why don t we just
start with sitting 
when i offered you a drink 
you said you never drank 
because i don t 
but you made it
a point of pride 
you could ve taken the glass
and not drunk 
you could ve said 
 not right now   and set it aside 
but you said 
 no  not me  i never drink  
you can t do
mentalism and drink 
you gotta be
on your toes all the time 
when you re on

he just blew it 
did pete teach you things 
yes 
he was older

he was old enough
to be your father 
i think we ve done enough 
did you ever stutter
as a child 
no 
because you have a slight movement 
compulsory movement 
your head moves up and
down  ever so slightly 
and humphries 
was he ever inappropriate
or abusive to you as a child 
shut your mouth 
shut your mouth 
it s all right  stanton 
answer me 
humphries took
my mother away
because my father wasn t man enough
to hold on to her  all right

always selling his tall tales
about jesus and a happy afterlife 
and what
do you sell 
i m a hustler
and i know it

so my love went
to a commoners  grave 
thank you kindly 
there you are 
so i wanted to know
what impression you got from her 
the girl that  uh 
you sensed during the test 
i didn t see her 
she didn t materialize 
but by that 
you mean she could 
well  it was very brief 
uh  mr  grindle 
uh  ezra  please 
i sensed
profound sadness and regret 
she loved you 
and that boy 
that baby boy 
it was a boy 
is she with me 
she s never far 
this place important to you 
this garden 
yes  i built it 
uh  to honor her 
the paths and the benches 
you see 
she would ve loved it 
she does 
i can sense it 
brother ezra  she   
she s trying to
tell me something 
it doesn t make
any sense 
sometimes they communicate
like that  it gets jumbled 
the letter  d  
dorrie  dorrie  is it 
i wanna see   
oh  i have to
see her again 
whatever it takes 
  i want you to   
  uh   
  materialize her 
  yeah 
do you have any idea
what would be required
for something
like that to occur 
i ll commit  10 000
for every session we have 
mr  grindle 
your sins are grave 
you would have to
work hard 
spiritually 
if you even wanna have the
chance to see or sense her 
listen  i have more money
than i will ever need 
but i have no hope 
and you think
you could buy that 
well   
not to be crude   
but i know i can 
are you sure that she can play
the lady in question 
molly 
she s tougher than i am 
i ll stage it at night 
keep ezra on his knees 
make him pray or something 
he ll stay put 
blood  she ll need blood
on her hands and dress 
more shocking the image 
the less inclined
ezra will be to examine it 
nothing can
hold you back 
to us 
 dear mom and all 
i m sending this from the fairgrounds 
 a boy named ezra took me 
 he had my picture taken
as you can see 
 tell pop and all i wish i was with
you and hug little jennie for me 
 will write soon 
fondly  dorrie  
she never mailed this 
what are you
talking about 
well  she died
a few days later 
this is the last thing she
wrote  and she never mailed it 
yeah  but that s not
why i showed it to you 
her family never got to see 
look 
who does that look like 
look at her face 
it s you 
i could materialize you
in a seance 
not me  stan 
we can buy a costume 
we can get a long black wig 
and we can cut it 
we can style it just like that 
he can unburden his soul
and he can forgive himself 
as far as i can tell 
that s what a preacher does
every other sunday 
and it worked
with judge kimball 
i believe it saved
their marriage 
i think he really
loved her  stan 
you can see that 
can t you 
all that suffering
that he had 
we can deliver him
some hope 
close it  yeah   
he wants to see you 
i m sure that he does 
come on in 
have a cup of coffee first 
are you gonna sit out
in the snow 
i won t bite 
you take  uh 
cream in your coffee 
no  thanks 
yeah  neither do i 
i don t know why
he bothers with you 
you re cheap  pal 
just phony 
but i ll tell you this 
  i care for that man 
  mmm 
i owe him a lot 
and if you re smart 
that should scare you 
she says you   
lied to her 
you gave a false name
and you left her body behind 
ezra  you have to
keep the circle 
i wanna see her now 
i wanna talk to her 
don t break the circle 
this takes patience 
i ve given you a fortune 
now it s time
that you delivered
to me something
other than guilt 
because i m done hearing
this endless fucking
recitation of what i did 
i know what the fuck   
i did 
and what i m going to do
if this goes on much longer 
  what does that mean 
  come on 
you ll just have
to find out 
you gonna stay here
and practice 
  can you ask for more time 
  no 
i m not sure
about this  stan 
i am sure 
we are out of time 
just go put on the wig
and the dress 
and that s the position 
hands down by your side 
with your palms open 
okay 
where are you going 
i gotta go get
everything ready 
i love you 
charles

what mr  carlisle said 
about us being
reunited with julian

i ve loved you the best i can 
as much as i can 
and i know now
it ll never be enough 
whatever is missing in you

  hey  hey 
  molly

 we  anymore 
there hasn t been
for a long time 
i don t know who
you re seeing on the side 
but you re certainly not
fucking me anymore 
i bet it s that frozen faced
bitch you were so impressed with 
i bet she seems
like class to you 
well  she s not
and neither are you 
molly 
molly  i was just trying to
get the inside track on her
because you didn t want me
to do the spook show 
that s why i was
sneaking around on you 
  hey  what s the big idea 
  just mind your own business 
this is the last time 
i promise 
and every day
is christmas after that 
oh  sure  the whole world
and everything in it 
i m scared  stan 
i m scared 
too  molly 
i m scared every day
of my life 
i m so scared sometimes
i can t even breathe 
but i fight it  molly 
i fight it 
that s the only way
i ve survived 
sometimes you don t see
the line until you cross it 
i crossed it 
i know that now 
molly  everybody s left me
in my life 
don t leave me  please 
please 
can i see your watch 
when i get rid of anderson 
i m gonna bring ezra to the park bench 
just up from
that open gate 
at 8 00  molly 
no earlier  no later 
you re gonna go through that gate
and you re gonna walk 20 paces 
okay 
when he sees you  i m gonna
put him on his knees 
and i m gonna
make him pray 
and when
he closes his eyes 
you get to go away
and then we re done 
simple 
i understand 
good 
do you remember
the old gag 
the current  when it would
run through my body 
mm hmm 
you know how
i could take it 
first few times i did it 
my muscles would cramp for days 
it really hurt bad 
but i d just try and tell
myself not to feel it  you know 
try and make myself
go numb 
but it was always really clear to
me when i couldn t take it anymore 
when i d had enough 
i ve had enough 
i ll be there at 8 00 and i ll
do what you need me to do 
now 
perhaps because of the nature
of what we re doing tonight 
we d benefit from being alone 
will you leave us 
sir  are you sure
about this 
yeah  i m sure  it s fine 
you have to have faith 
let s walk the path 
in view of prime
minister churchill s recent pledge
that a british declaration
of war on japan
would follow almost immediately
upon the outbreak of war
between japan and the united states 
a british announcement is expected soon 
i place no blame on you
and i want you
to know that 
but i think
we should go back inside 
you asked me
to purge my soul from sin 
that s right 
i haven t done that 
you re gonna do it now 
you re gonna purge your soul
and invoke her forgiveness 
i ve done things that
i ve never told anyone about 
and you re gonna
tell her now 
  no  i can t 
  close your eyes 
  i can t 
  be still 
don t  don t make me 
please 
and tell her 
dorrie 
dorrie

through the years   
i have hurt
many young women 
i don t know why 
i was seeking   
i was seeking you in them 
or i was seeking to rid
my soul of this anger 
i   
i don t know 
what did you do 
i don t know 
i hurt them 
i hurt them 
dorrie

patient stanton carlisle 
final therapy session 
what are you doing 
they re all singles 
where s the dough 
what are you referring to 
mr  carlisle 
the money 
you took it

these delusions are becoming
part of your condition 
you crazy fucking bitch 
i ll tell them
everything we did 
did what  tell me 
we did it together 
i m sorry  mr  carlisle 
but have we met anywhere
other than this office 
cut it out 
what are you doing 
you came unannounced 
my secretary
allowed you in 
i did everything
i could 
but it seems you ve made
a transference to me 
both as your mistress
and your mother 
i had tried to avert
a serious upset 
it seems that
i have failed 
the symbolism is quite
obvious  mr  carlisle 
you have a very peculiar
relationship to older men 
ezra grindle 
for example 
but also the man you claimed
to have killed at the carnival 
why 
why are you doing this 
you don t even
care about the money 
you re such a disappointment 
no  you re right 
money doesn t matter to me 
but it means everything
to you  doesn t it 
you re a small 
small man 
you don t fool people 
stan 
they fool themselves 
you think you stand high
above the common man 
you re nothing but an okie
with straight teeth 
you think you could
take me  stan 
you re so blind 
aren t you 
you can t read
the signs 
didn t you notice
my clutch was heavy 
am i powerful enough
for you now  stan 
yes  yes  security 
i need help 
there s a man 
a patient of mine 
come immediately 
come on  stan 
you think you can
take my breath away 
you all right  doctor 
i ll live 
i gotta move it out 
okay  close it 
i always
hated you 
hey  no more mooching 
you either pay your suds

oh  you like that 
bought it off an old
ten in one that s folded

enoch

enoch 
so  what do you need 
i would like to apologize
for my appearance 
i ve  uh  fallen onto
some hard times of late 
but i do have an act
that i know would be
of great value to you

let s have a snort 
come on  sit 
i don t like mentalism 
it s too old timey

to think of something 
i might have one job that
you could take a crack at 
it ain t much and i m not begging
you to take it  but it s a job 
it ll keep you
in coffee and cakes 
dry place to sleep 
shot now and then 
  what do you say

just until we get
a real geek
