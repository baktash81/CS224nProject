loved but he hates that man
death
death and the wish of death
he loved that watch
that was his pride
my father

to a different word
babum
zeena feeds them to me
please concentrate on the object
i have in my hand professor
please
an object 21
emphasis on concentrate means
that it is old and worn down
cheap
babum
but
you gotta know
how to read the mark
how they move
and talk dress
people are desperate
to tell you who they are
desperate to be seen
aint that the truth
yeah but how do you know
if you got em hooked
well you pause
thats right
you take a moment
would you excuse me please
i need a glass of water
yeah or you faint
weakened by the effort
howd you know
about my father though
thats a stock reading
its a black rainbow
one size fits all
thrifty but generous
private but friendly
and and you
you hated him but loved him
now everybodys had
some trouble
somebody theyve hated
shadow from their past
and usually for a boy
its the old man
now if the mark is older
you say you had uh
some present loss

never court
the sins of lust or pride
i was turned into this sorrowful
shape for i disobeyed my parents
they wanted
only my wellbeing
born during
an electrical storm
the atmosphere charged
with electrostatic power
i am now able to
withstand thousands
upon thousands of volts
as they will course
through my body
but you must be warned
to keep your distance
for this entertainment carries with
it the danger of electrocution
even for those
in close proximity
im not like this

minutes before zeena starts

for your act
now in your show

think of that
an electric chair
and they put you in it
manacles in
and the audience is going
whats going on here
all of a sudden
little guy comes shufflin out
with an executioners hood
he pulls this lever
and they get real scared
they think maybe
youre gonna die
and boom you got them
theyre back on their heels
what do you say
you wanna execute me
just for a second
then you come back to life
you drew me
yeah i draw
whats on my mind
you could make a living
at this
my mama used to put me in these
contests when i was a kid
i used to win all of them

just something ive always done
helps me think
you do know this is
the ragtag opera right

force with some drama

major please

molly
molly you okay
make way
she just saved
your deputies lives
molly molly
i am closing you down
i aint none of
your thieving southern police
kissing a priests toe on sundays
and raking in graft six days a week
is your name jeremiah
jeremiah jeremiah
j jer j j
jedediah judd
yeah
a matter of the utmost
importance has arisen sir
if i could just have
a minute of your time
a message has come through
and i think youre gonna wanna hear it
but not in front of these kind folks
please sir
nobody leaves
thank you
thank you
my name is stanton carlisle
marshal judd and my familys scot
scots are gifted with what the old
folks used to call second sight
now its clear to me
for example
that you are a man
who is generally distrustful
but also fiercely loyal
id say thats a
fair description
and uh this is
none of my business
because i know that you are capable
of handling your own affairs
and anything else liable to come
along but i do sense a childhood
marred in disease
and it makes you uh
feel hemmed in by it
trapped even to this day
and i sense a curio
of some kind
an amulet a memento
you carry it on your person
you had it for a long time
whos mary
a saintly woman
my my mother
may i see it
may i see it sir
yes
she wants you to know
that your ailment has not
shunned you from greatness
quite the contrary
your community loves you and
feels protected by you sir
and yes you couldnt serve
your country on foreign soil
but you protect us
here at home
and this medal
this medal should be a
reminder of her love for you
and as long as
you just keep it here
close to your heart
where our lord jesus christ resides
its gonna protect you
in the future
and she wants you
to know this sir
its only by being merciful to
others that a man has true power
but once i copped the
warrant off that deputy
i saw the marshals name
i knew it was
a leadpipe cinch
you know whats funny
pete used to always say
its not the clothes
but the shoes
that could tell you
everything you need to know
about a man
right
and he had a lift
in his right shoe
and i bet you he had polio
or something as a kid
you know the military never
letting him in mamas boy
i could tell by
the look in his eyes
thats good
well it takes one
to know one
he tried to railroad us clem
with that
fancy moustache
i saw that chain
around his neck
i got it out of him
saint christopher medal
all that bible talk
i thought well
he must know somebody named mary
right
and lo and behold
the lord blessed us
his mothers
names mary
you had him
molly

very interesting in there
a small pistol
nickel plated
ivory handle
may i
you claim to carry it to
defend yourself but
i think you do it
because you like it
i think you do it because
it makes you feel powerful
well madam
you are not powerful
not powerful enough
you are an only child

your mother died
when you were young
her shadow looms large and
close too close for comfort
hardly a day went by

of and sell it back to them
as long as
you dont oversell it
you wanna know
how i knew about the gun
i removed the blindfold
both for dramatic effect
and to get a rise
out of the audience
but also to see the way
you held your clutch
elbow bent forward
clutch was heavy
and you lifted it with your
left no wedding ring
no tan mark unmarried
so you like to go
out at night
you were at the copa
so you got the bees
but i assume you like to go to
lower places too dont you
if i want mud on my skirt

no man in the house
gotta have a gun at home
but you assume yourself to be a
lady so not a big pipe
something small portable 22

nickel plated ivory handle
but you talked
about my mother
why
well dames like you

start with sitting
when i offered you a drink

a point of pride
you couldve taken the glass
and not drunk
you couldve said

you cant do
mentalism and drink
you gotta be
on your toes all the time
when youre on

when i poured the whiskey
you winced
why
did i
yes
thats not something
i need to talk to you about
the truth
we shook on it
i didnt like the way
it smelled was all
you were 12 feet away
stuff smelled off to me
how so
smelled like wood alcohol
you drank wood alcohol
no not me never
never
its that word again
please lie down
please
i uh
its a guy that i knew
he tanked up on wood alky
and he kicked off
what are you

take your time
pianos
elaborate
my mother

your mother
to me
who played the piano
mr carlisle
guy named humphries

i didnt think i said
pete
pete
how did pete
get the alcohol
i gave it to him
but it was a mistake
mistake
what was he to you
did you admire him
parts of him
i think you pitied him
i dont know
he had his fair shake
he just blew it
did pete teach you things
yes
he was older
wasnt he
he was old enough
to be your father
i think weve done enough
did you ever stutter
as a child
no
because you have a slight movement
compulsory movement
your head moves up and
down ever so slightly
and humphries
was he ever inappropriate
or abusive to you as a child
shut your mouth
shut your mouth
its all right stanton
answer me
humphries took
my mother away
because my father wasnt man enough
to hold on to her all right
bible spouting hypocrite
always selling his tall tales
about jesus and a happy afterlife
and what
do you sell
im a hustler
and i know it
im on the make and i know it
get it
i am nothing like my old man
and i never will be
never

life happened to me
patient ezra grindle
therapy session number four
i am alone
lost
i feel lost
everything i earn
feels hollow
would you elaborate please
may 1901
the last time i saw her alive
i didnt i
doris mae cable
i couldnt
claim her body
property for
register number 28030
because
i wouldve been ruined
so my love went
to a commoners grave
thank you kindly
there you are
so i wanted to know
what impression you got from her
the girl that uh
you sensed during the test
i didnt see her
she didnt materialize
but by that
you mean she could
well it was very brief
uh mr grindle
uh ezra please
i sensed
profound sadness and regret
she loved you
and that boy
that baby boy
it was a boy
is she with me
shes never far
this place important to you
this garden
yes i built it
uh to honor her
the paths and the benches
you see
she wouldve loved it
she does
i can sense it
brother ezra she
shes trying to
tell me something
it doesnt make
any sense
sometimes they communicate
like that it gets jumbled
the letter d
dorrie dorrie is it
i wanna see
oh i have to
see her again
whatever it takes
i want you to
uh
materialize her
yeah
do you have any idea
what would be required
for something
like that to occur
ill commit 10000
for every session we have
mr grindle
your sins are grave
you would have to
work hard
spiritually
if you even wanna have the
chance to see or sense her
listen i have more money
than i will ever need
but i have no hope
and you think
you could buy that
well
not to be crude
but i know i can
are you sure that she can play
the lady in question
molly
shes tougher than i am
ill stage it at night
keep ezra on his knees
make him pray or something
hell stay put
blood shell need blood
on her hands and dress
more shocking the image
the less inclined
ezra will be to examine it
nothing can
hold you back
to us
dear mom and all
im sending this from the fairgrounds
a boy named ezra took me
he had my picture taken
as you can see
tell pop and all i wish i was with
you and hug little jennie for me
will write soon
fondly dorrie
she never mailed this
what are you
talking about
well she died
a few days later
this is the last thing she
wrote and she never mailed it
yeah but thats not
why i showed it to you
her family never got to see
look
who does that look like
look at her face
its you
i could materialize you
in a seance
not me stan
we can buy a costume
we can get a long black wig
and we can cut it
we can style it just like that
he can unburden his soul
and he can forgive himself
as far as i can tell
thats what a preacher does
every other sunday
and it worked
with judge kimball
i believe it saved
their marriage
i think he really
loved her stan
you can see that
cant you
all that suffering
that he had
we can deliver him
some hope
close it yeah
he wants to see you
im sure that he does
come on in
have a cup of coffee first
are you gonna sit out
in the snow
i wont bite
you take uh
cream in your coffee
no thanks
yeah neither do i
i dont know why
he bothers with you
youre cheap pal
just phony
but ill tell you this
i care for that man
mmm
i owe him a lot
and if youre smart
that should scare you
she says you
lied to her
you gave a false name
and you left her body behind
ezra you have to
keep the circle
i wanna see her now
i wanna talk to her
dont break the circle
this takes patience
ive given you a fortune
now its time
that you delivered
to me something
other than guilt
because im done hearing
this endless fucking
recitation of what i did
i know what the fuck
i did
and what im going to do
if this goes on much longer
what does that mean
come on
youll just have
to find out
you gonna stay here
and practice
can you ask for more time
no
im not sure
about this stan
i am sure
we are out of time
just go put on the wig
and the dress
and thats the position
hands down by your side
with your palms open
okay
where are you going

bitch you were so impressed with
i bet she seems
like class to you
well shes not
and neither are you
molly
molly i was just trying to
get the inside track on her
because you didnt want me
to do the spook show
thats why i was
sneaking around on you
hey whats the big idea
just mind your own business
this is the last time
i promise
and every day
is christmas after that
oh sure the whole world
and everything in it
im scared stan
im scared
too molly
im scared every day
of my life
im so scared sometimes
i cant even breathe
but i fight it molly
i fight it
thats the only way
ive survived
sometimes you dont see
the line until you cross it
i crossed it
i know that now
molly everybodys left me
in my life
dont leave me please
please
can i see your watch
when i get rid of anderson
im gonna bring ezra to the park bench
just up from
that open gate
at 800 molly
no earlier no later
youre gonna go through that gate
and youre gonna walk 20 paces
okay
when he sees you im gonna
put him on his knees
and im gonna
make him pray
and when
he closes his eyes
you get to go away
and then were done
simple
i understand
good
do you remember
the old gag
the current when it would
run through my body
mmhmm
you know how
i could take it
first few times i did it
my muscles would cramp for days
it really hurt bad
but id just try and tell
myself not to feel it you know
try and make myself
go numb
but it was always really clear to
me when i couldnt take it anymore
when id had enough
ive had enough
ill be there at 800 and ill
do what you need me to do
now
perhaps because of the nature
of what were doing tonight
wed benefit from being alone
will you leave us
sir are you sure
about this
yeah im sure its fine
you have to have faith
lets walk the path
in view of prime
minister churchills recent pledge
that a british declaration
of war on japan
would follow almost immediately
upon the outbreak of war
between japan and the united states
a british announcement is expected soon
i place no blame on you
and i want you
to know that
but i think
we should go back inside
you asked me
to purge my soul from sin
thats right
i havent done that
youre gonna do it now
youre gonna purge your soul
and invoke her forgiveness
ive done things that
ive never told anyone about
and youre gonna
tell her now
no i cant
close your eyes
i cant
be still
dont dont make me
please
and tell her
dorrie
dorrie

through the years

many young women

my soul of this anger

i dont know
i hurt them
i hurt them

what did you say
did i oversell it
patient stanton carlisle
final therapy session
what are you doing
theyre all singles
wheres the dough
what are you referring to
mr carlisle
the money
you took it
try to understand
these delusions are becoming
part of your condition
you crazy fucking bitch
ill tell them
everything we did
did what tell me
we did it together
im sorry mr carlisle
but have we met anywhere
other than this office
cut it out
what are you doing
you came unannounced
my secretary
allowed you in
i did everything
i could
but it seems youve made
a transference to me
both as your mistress
and your mother
i had tried to avert
a serious upset
it seems that
i have failed
the symbolism is quite
obvious mr carlisle
you have a very peculiar
relationship to older men
ezra grindle
