dreaded siege
babylons wealth allowed lay enough grain
last years
towers walls gates formidable
even untrained men could defend ease
walls high scale
parapets wide enough chariots patrol
rivetfed moat cross even getting
enough freeze heart
even old soldier
one night lay ground
courting sleep would come
thought came
whence came know
like spirit god whispered ear
river euphrates flowed babylon
raised natural level hemmed dams dikes
dams opened full dikes broken
river ran straight heart city
would fall nothing
army poised ready strike
could march city dry riverbed
underneath gates designed repel ships
river normal level
suddenly realized id given key
defeat mighty babylon
though world
throughout history
one thought
required right moment act
night every man babylon
least king
would drink ill honor gods
naught worthless idols
could protect
listen oh king
tell second king story
belshazzar king babylon
foolish wicked equal measure
king
enough
still threefold walls battlements
within granaries grain enough endure
seed years
watchmen seen persians digging lord
seem quite concerned king

human hand scribed
tongue interpret
tell means good ill
oh king high god
gave father nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar
greatness glory
heart became arrogant
deposed throne stripped glory
acknowledged high sovereign

goblets temple brought
praised gods bronze iron
wood stone instead
vessels made service high
used pour wine harlots

beg scraps food beneath table
would could almighty knows
answer
lord god strike like enemy
bidden angel unsheathe sword
words written
