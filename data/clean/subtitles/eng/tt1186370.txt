heartbreakers go to live and dream

every single month
30000 prom kings
and queens
and little miss cute tits

with stars in their eyes
and a dream in their heart
when i first came out here
i had a dream
a dream of an easy life
i was gonna get rich
from lyin around
having my picture taken
i was gonna live in the hills
and drive a noisy yellow sports car
and fuck 6 girls
who weighed 89 lbs
guess what most of it came true

that you planted
remains

with their hearts broken
