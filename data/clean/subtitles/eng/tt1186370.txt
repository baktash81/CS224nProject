heartbreakers go to live and dream 
30 000 of them arrive here

with stars in their eyes
and a dream in their heart 
when i first came out here 
i had a dream   
a dream of an easy life 
i was gonna get rich
from lyin  around
having my picture taken 
i was gonna live in the hills
and drive a noisy yellow sports car
and fuck 6  girls
who weighed 89 lbs

for the tight skin of a 20 year old 
i am in need of assiduation
and that changes the game 
ah  here we go
