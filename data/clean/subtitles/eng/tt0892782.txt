my name is general
wrÂ monguer
im in charge of this facility now
follow me its time for your orientation
in 1950 it was decided
that jane and joe
public can not handle
the truth about monsters
and should focus in more
important things like paying taxes
so the goverment convinced the world
monsters were stuff of myth and legend
and then locked them away
in this here facility
but im not a monster
im just a regular person
im not a danger to
anyone or anything
dont let her get me
sorry
how long will i be here
indefinitely
can i contact my parents
no
derek
negative
do they know where i am

this place is an x file
wrapped in a coverup and
deepfried in a paranoid conspiracy
there will be zero contact

brave president
own approved goverment

have about two weeks left
if that think walks into a populated
area there will be a major catastrophe
we need our top scientific minds
on this get india on the phone
if we transport the
us to a safer planet
i say we give this alien a green card
and make him proud to be an american
sir its at dire times like this when i stop
and ask myself what would oprah do

be the other one sir
what idiot
designed this thing
you did sir
fair enough
wilson fire somebody
listen up
im not going to go down in history
as the president who was in office
when the world came to an end so somebody
think of something and think of it fast
thats a good capuccio
mr president
not only do i have an
idea but i have a plan
now conventional weapons
have no effect on this thing
and we all know
nukes aint an option
sure they are i just
no no no the button wait
im not gonna kid you mr president
these are dark times
the odds are against us
we need a hail mary pass
we need raw power we need
monsters
monsters
of course
its so simple
i im not following you
over the last 50 years i have
captured monsters on the
rampage and locked them up
in a secret prison facility
so secret that the mere mention
of its name is a federal offense
is he referring
to area fifty
mr president say
hello to insectasaur
miss ronson please
nuclear radiation turned
him from a small grub
into a 350 foot tall monster
that attacked tokyo
here we have the missing link
a 20000 years
old frozen fishman
who was thawed out
by scientists
he escaped went on a rampage
in his old watering hole
this handsome fellow
is dr cockroach phd
the most brilliant
man in the world
he invented a scientific
machine that would give humans
the cockroaches
ability to survive
unfortunately there
was a side effect
now we call this thing bob
could someone get
her out of here
thank you
a genetically altered tomato
was combined with a chemically
altered ranchflavor dessert
topping at a snack food plant
the resulting goo gained consciousness and
became an indistructible gelatinous mass
and our latest
addition ginormica
general continue
her entire body radiates with pure energy
giving her enormous strength and size
sir these monsters are our best
and only chance to defeat that robot
dont we already have
an alien problem general
i dont think we need
a monster problem too
you got a better idea nerd
ok stay where you are
general i propose we go forward with
your monsters vs aliens idea thingy

i know this is
a little weird
ok its a lot weird
but well figure it out
i know that together we can find
a way to get me back to normal
susan try to look at
this from my perspective
i have an audience that
depends on me for news
weather sports and
heartwarming fluff pieces
so you expect me to put
all that on hold while
you try to undo this
thing that happened to you
that i had absolutely
nothing to do with
yes
thats exactly what i expect
what about the life that we always
talked about dont you still want that
of course
i just
dont see how i can
have that with you
derek please
dont do this
you have to face facts susan
and dont crush me for saying
this but im not looking to get
married and spend the rest of
my life in someone elses shadow
and youre casting
a pretty big shadow
im sorry
its over
good luck susan
leaving modesto
come again
wow what a shindig
your parents really
know how to throw it down
that was a great party one of the best
ive been to since i got out of prison
i must have been at
a different party
cause thats not how i
interpreted it at all
i dont think your
parents liked me
and i think that jello
gave me a fake phone number
well at least the
garbage was free and
who are we kidding
we could save every city
on the planet and theyd
still treat us the same way
theyve always treated us
like monsters
right monsters
anyway
how how is derek
derek is a selfish jerk
no
yes
all that talk about us
im so proud of us
us just got a job in fresno
there was no us
there was only derek
why did i have to get hit
by a meteor to see that
idiot
why did i ever think life with
derek would be so great anyway
i mean look at all the
stuff ive done without him
fighting an alien robot
that was me not him
and that was amazing
meeting you guys
amazing
dr cockroach you can
crawl up walls and
build a supercomputer out of a pizza box
two cans of hair spray and
and a paper clip
amazing
and you you hardly need an
introduction you are the missing link
you personally carried 250
coeds off of cocoa beach and
still have the strength
to fight the national guard
and the coast guard
and also the life guard
amazing
bob who else could fall from unimaginable
heights and end up without a single scratch
link
you
amazing
good point insecto susan
dont shortchange yourself
oh im not gonna shortchange
myself ever again
susan
way to go insecto
insecto look out
insectosaurus
nooo
its gonna be alright
look at me
dont you close those eyes
dont you dare
close those eyes
you cant
mom
you must be terrified
you wake up in a strange
place wearing strange clothes
imprisoned by a strange being
floating on a strange hovering device
strange isnt it
hardly
its not the first time
wow you really get around
to the extraction chamber
look what is it that
you want from me
you have stolen what
is rightfully mine
i didnt steal
anything from you
your enormous grotesque
body contains quantonium
the most powerful
substance in the universe
did you really think you
could keep it from me
thats what this is
all about you destroyed
san francisco you terrified
millions of people
you killed my friend
just to get to me
silence
your voice is
grinding on my ear knobs
its a shame you wont be around to
see what the power of quantonium can do
in the tentacles of someone
who knows how to use it
i know how to use it
just
dont bother that force
field is impenetrable
what the flagnog
ha that should
stop your puny
computer close door hangar 2
close door hangar 3
close hangar 4
close them all
computer
begin extraction
finally i can rebuild my
civilization on a new planet
any thoughts on where
i should set up shop
your planet perhaps
you keep your slimy
tentacles off my planet
if you wanted to stop me you shouldve
done it when you possessed the quantonium
now you are nothing
there innocent people down
there who didnt do anything
there were innocent people on my
home planet before it was destroyed
look im sorry your
planet was destroyed
oh dont be im the
one who destroyed it
confused
after i reveal my tale to you
everything will become crystal clear
computer initialize
cloning machine
