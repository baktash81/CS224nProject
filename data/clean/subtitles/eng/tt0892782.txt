madam  i assure you 
i am not a cyborg 
my name is general
w r Â monguer 
i m in charge of this facility  now
follow me  it s time for your orientation 
in 1950 it was decided
that jane and joe
public can not handle
the truth about monsters 
and should focus in more
important things like paying taxes 
so the goverment convinced the world
monsters were stuff of myth and legend 
and then locked them away
in this here facility 
but i m not a monster 
i m just a regular person 
i m not a danger to
anyone or anything 
don t let her get me 
sorry 
 how long will i be here 
 indefinitely 
 can i contact my parents 
 no 
 derek 
 negative 
 do they know where i am 
 no  and they never will 
this place is an x file 
wrapped in a cover up and
deepfried in a paranoid conspiracy 
there will be zero contact
with the outside world 
7  8

hanging from a real tree

your name to ginormica 
begin re animation sequence 
who dares to wake me 
quantonium has been located on a
distant planet in the omega quadrant

have about two weeks left 
if that think walks into a populated
area there will be a major catastrophe 
we need our top scientific minds
on this  get india on the phone 
if we transport the
us to a safer planet 
i say we give this alien a green card
and make him proud to be an american 
sir  it s at dire times like this when i stop
and ask myself  what would oprah do 
hang it all

that button lauches all
of our nuclear missiles

be the other one  sir 
what idiot
designed this thing 
you did  sir 
fair enough 
wilson  fire somebody 
listen up 
i m not going to go down in history
as the president who was in office
when the world came to an end  so somebody
think of something and think of it fast 
that s a good capu ccio 
mr president 
not only do i have an
idea but i have a plan
now conventional weapons
have no effect on this thing 
and we all know
nukes ain t an option 
 sure they are  i just 
 no  no  no the button  wait 
i m not gonna kid you  mr president 
these are dark times 
the odds are against us 
we need a hail mary pass 
we need raw power  we need 
monsters 
monsters 
of course 
it s so simple 
i  i m not following you 
over the last 50 years i have
captured monsters on the
rampage and locked them up
in a secret prison facility 
so secret that the mere mention
of its name is a federal offense 
is he referring
to area fifty 
mr president  say
hello to insecta saur 
miss ronson  please 
nuclear radiation  turned
him from a small grub 
into a 350 foot tall monster 
that attacked tokyo 
here we have  the missing link  
a 20 000 years
old frozen fishman 
who was thawed out
by scientists 
he escaped  went on a rampage
in his old watering hole 
this handsome fellow
is dr cockroach ph d
the most brilliant
man in the world 
he invented a scientific
machine that would give humans 
the cockroaches 
ability to survive 
unfortunately there
was a side effect 
now  we call this thing bob 
could someone get
her out of here 
thank you 
a genetically altered tomato
was combined with a chemically 
altered ranch flavor dessert
topping at a snack food plant 
the resulting goo gained consciousness and
became an indistructible gelatinous mass 
and our latest
addition  ginormica 
general  continue 
her entire body radiates with pure energy
giving her enormous strength and size 
sir  these monsters are our best
and only chance to defeat that robot 
don t we already have
an alien problem  general 
i don t think we need
a monster problem too 
you got a better idea nerd 
ok  stay where you are 
general  i propose we go forward with
your monsters vs aliens idea  thingy 
go fish

ah  i feel so stupid 
everyone just stay calm  whatever

anyone cares for atomic gin fizz 
it s got quite a 
kick 
chlorine  chlorine 
chlorine in my eyes 
everyone  run for your lives 
what are they
running away from 
that s hilarious  jim 
that s exactly the kind down home country
humor i m gonna miss when i m in fresno 
this is derek dietl  signing
off for the very last time 
good night  modesto 
channel 172
and  cut 
did you like that sign off 
just made it up 
oh  my goodness 
wait  wait  wa  it 
oh  derek 
you wouldn t believe my last 3

the golden gate bridge 
well  that was the only way i
was gonna stop that giant robot 
did you ever think i could
do something like that 
no  i didn t 
i can honestly say that it never ever 
ever  ever  ever  ever ever occurred to me 
i know this is
a little weird 
ok  it s a lot weird 
but we ll figure it out 
i know that together we can find
a way to get me back to normal 
susan  try to look at
this from my perspective 
i have an audience that
depends on me for news 
weather  sports and
heartwarming fluff pieces 
so you expect me to put
all that on hold while
you try to undo this
thing that happened to you 
that i had absolutely
nothing to do with 
yes 
that s exactly what i expect 
what about the life that we always
talked about  don t you still want that 
of course 
i just 
don t see how i can
have that with you 
derek  please 
don t do this 
you have to face facts  susan 
and don t crush me for saying
this  but i m not looking to get
married and spend the rest of
my life in someone else s shadow 
and you re casting
a pretty big shadow 
i m sorry 
it s over 
good luck  susan 
leaving modesto
come again
wow  what a shindig 
your parents really
know how to throw it down 
that was a  great party  one of the best
i ve been to  since i got out of prison 
i must have been at
a different party 
cause that s not how i
interpreted it at all 
i don t think your
parents liked me 
and i think that jello
gave me a fake phone number 
well  at least the
garbage was free and 
who are we kidding 
we could save every city
on the planet and they d
still treat us the same way
they ve always treated us 
like monsters 
right  monsters 
anyway 
how  how is derek 
derek  is a selfish jerk 
 no 
 yes 
all that talk about  us  
i m so proud of  us  
 us just got a job in fresno  
there was no  us  
there was only derek 
why did i have to get hit
by a meteor to see that 
idiot 
why did i ever think life with
derek would be so great  anyway 
i mean  look at all the
stuff i ve done without him 
fighting an alien robot 
that was me  not him 
and that was amazing 
meeting you guys

dr cockroach  you can
crawl up walls and 
build a supercomputer out of a pizza box 
two cans of hair spray and 
and a paper clip 
amazing 
and you  you hardly need an
introduction  you are the missing link 
you personally carried 250
coeds off of cocoa beach and
still have the strength
to fight the national guard 
and the coast guard 
and also the life guard 
amazing 
bob  who else could fall from unimaginable
heights and end up without a single scratch 
link

good point  insecto  susan 
don t shortchange yourself 
oh  i m not gonna shortchange
myself  ever again 
susan 
way to go insecto 
insecto look out 
insectosaurus 
nooo 
it s gonna be alright 
look at me 
don t you close those eyes 
don t you dare
close those eyes 
you can t 
mom 
you must be terrified 
you wake up in a strange
place  wearing strange clothes 
imprisoned by a strange being 
floating on a strange hovering device 
strange  isn t it 
hardly 
it s not the first time 
wow  you really get around 
to the extraction chamber 
look  what is it that
you want from me 
you have stolen what
is rightfully mine 
i didn t steal
anything from you 
your enormous grotesque
body  contains quantonium 
the most powerful
substance in the universe 
did you really think you
could keep it from me 
that s  what this is
all about  you destroyed
san francisco  you terrified
millions of people 
you killed my friend 
just to get to me 
silence 
your voice is
grinding on my ear knobs 
it s a shame you won t be around to
see what the power of quantonium can do 
in the tentacles of someone
who knows how to use it 
i know how to use it 
just 
don t bother  that force
field is impenetrable 
what the flagnog 
ha  that should
stop your puny 
computer  close door hangar 2 
close door hangar 3 
close hangar 4 
close them all 
computer 
begin extraction 
finally  i can rebuild my
civilization on a new planet 
any thoughts on where
i should set up shop 
your planet  perhaps 
you keep your slimy
tentacles off my planet 
if you wanted to stop me  you should ve
done it when you possessed the quantonium 
now you are nothing 
there innocent people down
there  who didn t do anything 
there were innocent people on my
home planet  before it was destroyed 
look  i m sorry your
planet was destroyed 
oh  don t be  i m the
one who destroyed it 
confused 
after i reveal my tale to you 
everything will become crystal clear
