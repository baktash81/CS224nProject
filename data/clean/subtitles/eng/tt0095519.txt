sawing metal
laughing maniacally
continues laughing
tires squealing
growling
mans voice remember the driver
must always see the big picture
when driving through
puddles or in heavy rain
your tires may
begin to hydroplane
actually ride on the water
rather than the pavement
if this happens to you dont panic
and especially dont jam on your brakes
in this actual scientific demonstration
we see that in as little
as a quarter inch of water
your tires may lose contact
with the surface completely
laughs
tires screech
bell rings
does your brother
have mono or something
he slept through the entire course
no
hes just braindead
mr anderson

i mean she can use it too
dont includeme in your obsessions
les isnt it premature to be
talking about getting a car
you just finished your drivers
ed course two hours ago
karl says that in america
people are mislead to believe
that a car represents freedom
and individuality  right
when in essence it is more
oppressive than anything else
burdening the individual
with such materialistic cost
wait who cares what your
commie boyfriend thinks
i see its great to be an american
i agree
yes
this is the most oppressive
environment a child can be raised in
natalie one day soon
it will all be over
youll go away

i dont believe it i mean
not only did you break
your explicit promise to me

i suppose you know where
this leaves you dont you
not in good shape
thats right
look dad just let me
explain it to you okay
she told me she lived three houses down
i thought i was taking her home
why didnt you tell her the truth
tell mercedes lane the truth
that les anderson doesnt have a license
yes
and risk her having a heart
attack from laughing so hard at me
mr anderson her her
having a heart attack
look dad please put
yourself in my shoes
look youre upsetting your mother
shes pregnant you know
dean do you understand what happens
if you get caught
driving without a license
they make you wait two years
before you can take the test again
thats 24 months thats
an awful lot of bus rides
relax deano i didnt get caught
and you would have done the
exact same thing that i did
now did you guys come over here
to ask me some questions or what
all right heres one
how can you identify a blind pedestrian
to whom you must yield
the right of way
this is a complete waste of time
its not like you just moved
here from bedrock or something
youve been a passenger
in a car all your life
classical music plays
and what is this shit
natalie

if youre driving 55 miles per hour
