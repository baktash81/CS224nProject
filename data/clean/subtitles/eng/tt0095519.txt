  sawing metal  
  laughing maniacally  
  continues laughing  
  tires squealing  
  growling  
man s voice  remember  the driver
must always see the big picture 
when driving through
puddles or in heavy rain 
your tires may
begin to hydroplane  
actually ride on the water
rather than the pavement 
if this happens to you  don t panic
and especially don t jam on your brakes 
in this actual scientific demonstration 
we see that in as little
as a quarter inch of water
your tires may lose contact
with the surface completely 
  laughs  
  tires screech  
  bell rings  
does your brother
have mono or something 
  he slept through the entire course 
  no 
he s just brain dead 
mr  anderson 
it s punks like you that paramedics
end up scraping off the
road at 4 00 in the morning 
for your sake and the safety of others 
i hope you fail your driving exam 
  engine revving  
wait up 
wait up  my bus 
    honking  
    tires screech  
you know  dean  i can t help wondering

  my granddad s afraid to take it on long trips 
so he borrowed my dad s car for a week 
do you know this boat would kick ass
up at archies 
do you think there s any chance
we can get it saturday night 
  not a chance in hell 
  no way 
  hey  dad  what s up

this is exactly what i ate
when i was pregnant with all
of you  you turned out okay 
  les  dad 
 yep 
did you  um  look at
the brochure i gave you 
 you bet 
  what did you think 
well  a  23 000 bmw
for a 16 year old kid who s
never had a job a day in his life 
i think it s a great idea 
but dad  the car
wouldn t only be for me 
i mean  she can use it too 
don t includeme in your obsessions 
les  isn t it premature to be
talking about getting a car 
you just finished your driver s
ed course two hours ago 
karl says that in america 
people are mislead to believe
  that a car represents freedom
and individuality     right 
when in essence  it is more
oppressive than anything else 
burdening the individual
with such materialistic cost  
wait  who cares what your
commie boyfriend thinks 
  i see it s great to be an american 
  i agree 
yes 
this is the most oppressive
environment a child can be raised in 
natalie  one day soon

i suppose you know where
this leaves you  don t you 
  not in good shape 
  that s right 
look  dad  just let me
explain it to you  okay 
she told me she lived three houses down 
i thought i was taking her home 
why didn t you tell her the truth 
tell mercedes lane the truth 
  that les anderson doesn t have a license 
  yes 
and risk her having a heart
attack from laughing so hard at me 
mr  anderson  her  her
having a heart attack 
look  dad  please put
yourself in my shoes 
look  you re upsetting your mother 
she s pregnant  you know 
dean  do you understand what happens
if you get caught
driving without a license 
they make you wait two years
before you can take the test again 
that s 24 months  that s
an awful lot of bus rides 
relax  deano  i didn t get caught 
and you would have done the
exact same thing that i did 
now  did you guys come over here
to ask me some questions  or what 
all right  here s one 
 how can you identify a blind pedestrian
to whom you must yield
the right of way  
this is a complete waste of time 
it s not like you just moved
here from bedrock or something 
you ve been a passenger
in a car all your life 
   classical music plays  
  and what is this shit 
natalie 
hey  natalie  i was wondering

   was so exciting      
  maybe i should take my shoes off 
  yeah 
good idea 
   strangers in the night   
   two lonely people
