this was the reverend porters wife

like a twodollar hooker
i think she looks nice
her lips are very thin
so i used the gloss to give
them a more sensual quality
and her eyes just needed a little definition
and her hair im sorry
nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972
she did
this photo was taken a month ago
at the church food drive
i just wanted to get past
this old schoolmarm image
that wasnt an image
she was an old schoolmarm
fix it
harry
i was just wondering
if there is anything wrong with vada
what do you mean
well the other night at dinner
that she just likes to play

the meyers are divorced
shelly can i have a cookie

you dont have to wait
daddy will be mad if youre late
okay
the great way is not difficult
for those with no preferences
with the absence of both love and hate
everything becomes clear
and undisguised
that was written by a chinese philosopher
in the year 600
now why would i choose to bring that up
in a creative writing class
because the absence of judgment
helps us to appreciate reality
in other words
i want you to listen
to your classmates writing
with a clear and open heart
okay
so whos going to go first
i got one
yeah
i sang a song for you to hear
i painted a picture for you to see
i picked a rose for you to smell
i planted grass for you to touch
but you did not hear my song
you did not see my picture
you did not smell my rose
and you did not touch my grass
maybe she was out of town
thats not funny
his poem is about futility
we toil in unrewarded obscurity
now i hear judgment
lets not forget the part
about the open heart
vada is there something i can do for you
i paid the money
for this class
i want to be a writer
but vada this is a
this is an adult writing class
hey i think its real beautiful
she wants to be a writer
more power to you little sister
vada you sure you want to do this
okay welcome to the class go find a seat
okay whos next
i experienced something
with my boyfriend the other day
and i wrote a few words down
floors yours ronda
he covers me like a blanket
from the cold dark night
as i look into his eyes i know its right
to touch to feel
i know hes real
flesh all a mesh
flesh all a mesh
i cant fight it
theres no point
i wake up and light a joint
vada
i wrote a poem too
please
ode to ice cream by vada sultenfuss
i like ice cream a whole lot
it tastes good when days are hot
on a cone or in a dish
this would be my only wish
vanilla chocolate or rocky road
even with pie a la mode

hi vada

a girls always got to look her best
i think lipstick looks fake
no ones lips are that color
have you ever tried any
no
come here sit down
go like this a little less
okay
all right
now first we blot
take a look
i think it looks real nice on you
shelly do you think im pretty
yes vada i think youre very pretty
youve got these great big sparkling eyes
the cutest little nose
an amazing mouth
the boys at school dont think i am
theyll come around
close your eyes
i want to bring out
the gorgeous color in them
now the first rule in applying eye makeup
is you can never wear
enough blue eye shadow
do you like putting makeup on people
ive been trying to get out
to hollywood for years
to do makeup for all the movie stars
but i havent gotten there yet
all right open your eyes
shelly i would definitely hold off
on that hollywood thing
your lip bleeding
no
whats wrong with your eyes
a girl can never wear enough eye shadow
wheres your bike
in the garage
walk me over
its only a garage come on
hey one of my streamers is gone
probably fell off in here
hey look at this
that was gramoos
its a phrenology chart
they used to study the bumps on your head
to see if you had a good personality or not
come here ill diagnose your head
i dont want to
come on its fun
interesting
what
you have no personality
hey where does it say that
never mind
is that your dad
yes
whos that with your dad
thats my mother
do you remember her
no
gramoo said shes in heaven
what do you think its like
what
heaven
i think
everybody gets their own white horse
and all they do is ride them
and eat marshmallows all day
and everybodys best friends
with everybody else
and when you play sports
theres no teams so nobody gets picked last
but what if youre afraid to ride horses
it doesnt matter
cause theyre not regular horses
they got wings
and its no big deal if you fall
cause you just land in a cloud
that doesnt sound so bad
come on well never find that streamer
well well well whats going on in here
nothing
im dressing
youre dressing

n38
under the n three eight
dont laugh heres a strategy to bingo
for instance on a given night
anybody can win but i play the odds
when choosing bingo cards
i use a range of theories
from the laws of probability
to avoiding duplicate number systems
this way you get much more activity
does it make it easier to win
no just more activity
i17
under the i one seven
hi carl vern

you know im not allowed out
by myself after dark
im just not lucky harry
its not always luck
i mean depending upon the placement
of the numbers
a guy with ten cards can win as easily
as a guy with 100
kind of like men
how do you mean
you can be in a room with 100 men
and not like any of them
or you can be in a room with just one man
and hes exactly the one you want
b1 under the b one
bingo

if you werent 200 years old

good night
before the class started
ronda and justin wanted to lead the class
in a group meditation
thats really cool
okay what were going to do
is send our vibes out into the group
everybody hold hands and close your eyes
relax your muscles and take deep breaths
now try to feel
what the other person is feeling
without speaking any words
send out your vibe
and receive the vibes
around you at the same time
can you feel it
okay open your eyes
what did everybody feel
i felt mrs hunsakers strength
i can feel that ronda is one with the earth
shes so cosmically in tune
so right on thats exactly what i sent out
and i felt like you were full
of inner peace and harmony
vada what did you feel
i felt justins hangnail
no vada thats not what were looking for
a hangnail is insignificant
whats in my soul
feel my aura
i dont think im allowed to
tell you what lets try it again
hold hands
gramoo once had a hangnail on her big toe
it got infected and traveled
to her vocal cords
ruined her singing voice
i dont think gramoo thought
it was insignificant
and some lettuce
watch out for the rust when you get lettuce
hey
i thought i recognized you two
hi vada
hi
we were picking things up for the barbecue
yeah me too mind if i tag along
not at all
a lot of potatoes

you know this is gonna be
my first fourth of july picnic

dad didnt you say
you needed prunes real bad
vada just put anything you want in the cart
anything at all
i dont know whats gotten into her today
i need olives
i used to like my ken and barbie dolls
ken was my favorite
then one christmas i got them a camper
and all they wanted to do
was hang out in it by themselves
so i wasnt too upset when they took that
wrong turn and went over a cliff
harry harry harry harry harry harry
i told you to use fewer briquettes

these two people
do not have a good relationship
ive been living in it for over a year
the camper is mine
excuse me mutual asset
thats what the lawyer said
its supposed to be our mutual asset
not shellys recreational vehicle
give me the keys
keep your voice down
why
my boss is watching us
im impressed

yeah all right
this is harry phil
gramoo and vada sultenfuss
vada sultenfuss

i like my name
this is danny and ralph
they own the dino raphael salon in detroit
we used to be married
are you here to take shelly back
nice to meet you
we got burgers and hot dogs here
if you care to join us
i cant stay im here because my wife
ex ex ex
my exwife seems
to have ripped off my camper
shelly
honestly harry he got the mustang
i promise
i dont think so in fact ive got a copy
of the property settlement right here
shit this is my lease
damn it i keep forgetting things
im getting senile
danny
what
okay i know youve suffered a terrible loss
and theres really nothing
anyone can do to comfort you
but i urge you to focus
on the times you had with the camper
the trips you took the sights you saw
those days are gone now
but theyll live on in your heart forever
is this guy boinking you
thats a real bonehead thing to say
look youre not going
to take shellys camper
no
its her home its where she lives
oh really okay fine look go cook
give me the goddamn keys
stop that that hurts
come on
danny
what did you do that for
who are you
im his brother
then youll probably be visiting us here
quite often
why
because if he ever tries
to take shellys camper again
im going to bury him in my front yard
your fathers a savage
bye ralph
well you were pretty great
is it really your camper
look
can you see them from the backyard
you can get the general idea
yeah there they are
they always look the same every year
look
did you
love him
i would never marry anybody i didnt love
he must like shelly
i never saw him hit anyone in his life
he likes her
does he love her
probably
do you like her
yes i do
and i think shes very good for your father
why
after your mother died
he was sad all the time
but before that he was pretty funny
really
now when i see him with shelly
sometimes he seems like the old harry
my dad was funny
well he wasnt one of the marx brothers
but he made me laugh
my uncle fought in the korean war
he had a steel plate put in his head
daddy said he didnt come back the same
one night we picked up a radio station
from oklahoma in his teeth
it was really neat
cant you see it
what
cant you see it
no
its there
vada there is no chicken bone
stuck in your throat
dr welty are you sure those are yours
so you fill it with water like this
and what have you got
a water gun
cool can i get one for vada
yes yes
thomas let me ask you a question
does vada ever tell you
why she comes down here so much
cause shes dying
do you think she is
no
why do you think she says that
because she gets scared
of all those dead people in her house
and you know that saying
cant beat them join them
well if shes one of them
she wont be as scared
you know what i think
i think vadas very lucky
to have a friend like you
shes my best friend
miss vada how are you feeling
as good as can be expected
hey vada guess what we got
what
this
hey you im going to get you
ill get you
give me that you creep
i just got you
no you didnt
whoa

you have to do something harry
the funerals starting
open your eyes shes 11 years old
her only friend in the world is dead
i know that but what do you want from me
stop hiding harry
you run harry
when i first came here
the idea of working with dead people
didnt exactly thrill me
but when i saw a family lived here
i thought
if im living without a family
at least i can work with one
and maybe once in a while
be invited in for supper
yeah and when those suppers are disrupted
because theres a car crash or theres a fire
or a little boy steps on a beehive
im not asking you
to stop feeling for those people
but life isnt just death harry
dont ignore the living
especially your daughter
excuse me harry shelly
the ministers about to begin
thank you arthur
we are here to honor thomas james sennett
he was born may 7 1961
in madison pennsylvania
he is survived by his loving parents
charles and susan sennett
his grandparents
william and gloria sennett
and gerald and marjorie finn
and many relatives friends and schoolmates
the interment will follow
at madison memorial park
the family has asked me to say a few words
before we proceed to the cemetery
no words i could say
would begin to express
the loss and grief we feel
one word that keeps ringing
in my ear is why
why would god choose
to take this little boy from us
well i cant give you
an answer to that question
but i can tell you
that god has chosen thomas j
for some very special reason
we must find solace
in knowing that thomas j is in gods care
in that place there is no sorrow or suffering
the lion lies with the lamb
the day is not divided
id like to read a passage from the bible
this is matthew 1913
at one point children were brought to him
that he might lay his hands
on them and pray
the disciples began to chastise them
but jesus said
let the children come to me
do not hinder them
the kingdom of god
belongs to such as these
and he laid his hands on their heads
before he left that place
let us pray in silence
you want to go treeclimbing thomas j
his face hurts
and where is his glasses
he cant see without his glasses
put his glasses on put on his glasses
he was going to be an acrobat
hes gone sweetheart hes gone
get away from me
vada wait

and kind
and she had your eyes

sometimes when you laugh

found out she was going to have you
she came home
and painted this whole room pink
she was so sure she would have a little girl
do you miss her
yes
i did very much for a long time
and even now i get a little sad
when i think about a pretty flower
or a beautiful sunset
that your mother would have liked
i think every time i see or climb a tree

thank you vada
encased in talent like a uniform
the rank of every poet is well known
they can amaze us like a thunderstorm
or die so young
or live for years alone
my advice to you on our last class
be a thunderstorm
what exactly do you mean by that
i mean
be dangerous
and unpredictable
and make a lot of noise
vada
hey
we missed you man
give me a hug
i was hoping youd stop by today
cant stay i just came to read my poem
wed love to hear it
weeping willow
with your tears running down
why do you always weep and frown
is it because he left you one day
is it because he could not stay
on your branches he would swing
do you long for the happiness
that day would bring
he found shelter in your shade
we thought his laughter would never fade
weeping willow stop your tears
for there is something to calm your fears
you think death
has ripped you forever apart
but i know hell always be in your heart
hi judy
vada
things are a little better these days
