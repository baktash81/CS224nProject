this was the reverend porter s wife 
you have her looking
like a two dollar hooker 
i think she looks nice 
her lips are very thin
so i used the gloss to give
them a more sensual quality
and her eyes just needed a little definition 
and her hair    i m sorry 
  nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972 
  she did 
this photo was taken a month ago
at the church food drive 
i just wanted to get past
this old schoolmarm image 
that wasn t an image

fix it 
harry 
i was just wondering
if there is anything wrong with vada 
what do you mean 
  well  the other night at dinner   
  that  she just likes to play 
i don t think so 
i think she s confused about death 
she was raised in a funeral home 
she knows a thing or two about it 
  but harry  i really think   
  she s a perfectly happy 11 year old girl 
look  don t give me any advice
about my daughter  okay

mostly love and romance 
gross 
they re just fun to read 
here  cheers 
are you married 
no  i m divorced 
daddy said it s bad
when people get divorced 
i know 
sometimes married people just find out
they can t live with each other 
the meyers are divorced 
shelly  can i have a cookie 
hey  where are all the cookies 
well  i guess you found
my secret hiding place 
what are you saving for

i m supposed to be home at noon for lunch 
thanks  shelly 
bye 
well  miss vada 
what do you say we head back 
  can i use your bathroom first 
  sure 
you don t have to wait 
daddy will be mad if you re late 
okay 
 the great way is not difficult
for those with no preferences 
 with the absence of both love and hate 
 everything becomes clear
and undisguised  
that was written by a chinese philosopher
in the year 600 
now  why would i choose to bring that up
in a creative writing class 
because the absence of judgment
helps us to appreciate reality 
in other words 
i want you to listen
to your classmates  writing
with a clear and open heart 
okay 
so  who s going to go first 
i got one 
yeah 
 i sang a song for you to hear
 i painted a picture for you to see
 i picked a rose for you to smell
 i planted grass for you to touch
 but you did not hear my song
 you did not see my picture
 you did not smell my rose
 and you did not touch my grass  
maybe she was out of town 
that s not funny 
his poem is about futility 
we toil in unrewarded obscurity 
now  i hear judgment 
let s not forget the part
about the open heart 
vada  is there something i can do for you 
i paid the money 
for this class 
i want to be a writer 
but vada  this is a   
this is an adult writing class 
hey  i think it s real beautiful 
she wants to be a writer 
more power to you  little sister 
vada  you sure you want to do this 
okay  welcome to the class  go find a seat 
okay  who s next 
i experienced something
with my boyfriend the other day
and i wrote a few words down 
floor s yours  ronda 
 he covers me like a blanket
 from the cold  dark night
 as i look into his eyes  i know it s right
 to touch  to feel
 i know he s real
 flesh  all a mesh
 flesh  all a mesh
 i can t fight it
 there s no point
 i wake up and light a joint 
vada 
i wrote a poem  too 
please 
ode to ice cream by vada sultenfuss 
 i like ice cream a whole lot
 it tastes good when days are hot
 on a cone or in a dish
this would be my only wish
 vanilla  chocolate or rocky road
even with pie a la mode  
that s all i got so far 
i hear that  vada 
 flesh all a mesh 
or  rocky road   it s about desire 
vada  that s    it s very sweet
and it rhymes and that s also good 
but you re not expressing to me
what s in your soul 
i want you to show me
how you see the world 
your fears  your desires 
your innermost secrets 
my fears and secrets 
i m afraid i killed my mother 
excuse me  harry  i m sorry 
i just want to let you know
the flowers were delivered
and the room s all set up 
thanks 
listen  i want to apologize
for the other day downstairs about vada 
i was a little harsh 
i shouldn t stick my nose
in other people s business 
it s just that i like vada very much 
after my wife died  gramoo moved in here
to help us take care of vada 
they were very close 
but lately  as her mind s
been wandering more and more 
vada s been acting kind of crazy 
i m sure she ll snap out of it  though 
i m sure she will 
nothing s biting today 
maybe they had a big breakfast 
i m going to be an acrobat when i grow up 
big deal  i can do that  too 
thomas j   you got something

it will bleed 
if i do it  can we go 
okay 
okay  rub them together 
now we re blood brothers for life 
hi

i cried my eyes out  did you see it 
i haven t been to the movies in ages 
i love to see movies 
especially at the drive in 
i don t think there s anything more romantic
than going to the drive in 
i ll let you get back to work 
i do enjoy playing bingo 
if you d like to join me for a game
tomorrow night at church 
you re welcome to 
okay 
hi  vada 
are you going out somewhere 
nope 
so how come you re putting lipstick on 
a girl s always got to look her best 
i think lipstick looks fake 
no one s lips are that color 
  have you ever tried any 
  no 
come here  sit down 
go like this  a little less 
okay 
all right 
now  first  we blot 
take a look 
i think it looks real nice on you 
shelly  do you think i m pretty 
yes  vada  i think you re very pretty 
you ve got these great  big sparkling eyes
the cutest little nose 
an amazing mouth 
the boys at school don t think i am 
they ll come around 
close your eyes 
i want to bring out
the gorgeous color in them 
now  the first rule in applying eye makeup
is you can never wear
enough blue eye shadow 
do you like putting makeup on people 
i ve been trying to get out
to hollywood for years
to do makeup for all the movie stars 
but i haven t gotten there yet 
all right  open your eyes 
shelly  i would definitely hold off
on that hollywood thing 
  your lip bleeding 
  no 
what s wrong with your eyes 
a girl can never wear enough eye shadow 
where s your bike 
in the garage 
walk me over 
it s only a garage  come on 
hey  one of my streamers is gone 
probably fell off in here 
hey  look at this 
that was gramoo s 
it s a phrenology chart 
they used to study the bumps on your head
to see if you had a good personality or not 
come here  i ll diagnose your head 
i don t want to 
come on  it s fun 
  interesting 
  what 
  you have no personality 
  hey  where does it say that 
never mind 
is that your dad 
yes 
who s that with your dad 
that s my mother 
  do you remember her 
  no 
gramoo said she s in heaven 
  what do you think it s like 
  what 
heaven 
i think   
everybody gets their own white horse
and all they do is ride them
and eat marshmallows all day 
and everybody s best friends
with everybody else 
and when you play sports
there s no teams  so nobody gets picked last 
but what if you re afraid to ride horses 
it doesn t matter
 cause they re not regular horses 
they got wings 
and it s no big deal if you fall 
 cause you just land in a cloud 
that doesn t sound so bad 
come on  we ll never find that streamer 
well  well  well  what s going on in here 
nothing 
i m dressing 
you re dressing 
harry  harry  harry  harry 
don t you know it s not nice
to lie to your big brother 
hey  watch the hair 
  the shirt 
  give 
all right 
  i m going out with shelly 
  yes  yes  that s great 
that s great 
  i m very nervous 
  why 
  the last date i had was 20 years ago 
  that s true 
harry  harry  sit down 
let me fill you in on today s women 
since the last time you dated 
something happened 
the sexual revolution 
now  before that you used
to have to hold a door open for a woman 
pull her chair out  pick up the check 
no more  no more 
you want to know what else is missing 
bras 
  come on 
  harry  i m serious 
trust me  harry  this woman s lib thing is in 
you got to treat her like
every tom  dick and harry 
are you sure about all this 
did you not tell vada i m a womanizer  huh 
i m running late 
shelly will be here any minute 
she s picking you up 
good  you re on the right track 
no  she s just driving over here 
then we re taking my car 
how do i look 
like a sultenfuss 
go get her 
  night  vada 
  dad   
why are you dressed up to play bingo 
i just want to look nice 
you never cared before 
well  shelly s coming over 
we re going to go together 
  why 
  she likes to play bingo 
can i go  too 
no  i think you better stay here
and keep gramoo company 
kitty  looks like your hunch really paid off 
yeah  well  i m glad 
though i got to admit
i d just as soon not have
any more bounty prisoners
coming through dodge
anytime soon 
it s a bit wearing on the nerves 
you know  this day was starting off just fine
and i m going to keep it that way 
doc  you never answered my question 
talk about wearing on the nerves   
vada 
  vada  where are you 
  here 
don t do that 
sorry 
what do you want 
my mom will skin me alive
if she finds out i m out here 
let s go to the church 
they re playing bingo tonight 
i told you  i d get in trouble 
  pacifist 
  am not 
  bed wetter 
  i stopped that 
 n 38  
under the  n   three  eight 
don t laugh  here s a strategy to bingo 
for instance  on a given night
anybody can win  but i play the odds 
when choosing bingo cards 
i use a range of theories
from the laws of probability
to avoiding duplicate number systems 
this way you get much more activity 
does it make it easier to win 
no  just more activity 
 i 17  
under the  i   one  seven 
hi  carl  vern 
they re not going to let us in  vada 
we re kids 
we re not going to bet 
we re just going to watch 
watch bingo  i don t even like to play bingo 
duck 
 n 4 2  
under the  n   four  two 
great 
  there s your dad and shelly 
  i don t want them to see me 
3 7 
 b 4  
under the  b   four 
 o 69  
under the  o   six  nine 
  i just had a terrible thought  harry 
  what s that 
i m going to be putting makeup
on some of these people very soon 
why do you think these seats were empty 
 b 6   under the  b   six 
  can we go yet 
  go 
you know i m not allowed out
by myself after dark 
  i m just not lucky  harry 
  it s not always luck 
i mean  depending upon the placement
of the numbers
a guy with ten cards can win as easily
as a guy with 100 
kind of like men 
how do you mean 
you can be in a room with 100 men
and not like any of them 
or you can be in a room with just one man 
and he s exactly the one you want 
 b 1   under the b  one 
bingo 
we have a winner 
will the winner please raise their hand 
there was no bingo  it came from outside 
  how could someone outside get a bingo 
  someone outside didn t get a bingo 
someone outside yelled  bingo   you moron 
  who you calling a moron 
  put a lid on it  vern 
put a lid on it 
if you weren t 200 years old 
i d kick your wrinkled ass 
it s just a bingo game 
we can go now 
i had a good time tonight 
i haven t had a bingo partner in ages 
would you like to come in
and see my house 
just for a minute 
okay  sure 
  home sweet home 
  it s nice 
i did it myself 
i read a magazine article
about how to maximize small spaces 
it certainly looks bigger than it seems 
you can look in the bathroom  if you want 
people are always curious about that 
like what happens when you flush 
yeah 
are you mad at me 
no  why 
i don t know 
tonight you just seemed a little cool 
not opening car doors and   
that was phil 
trying to give me advice
on dating  70s women 
look  i m so out of touch 
i haven t dated a woman in ages 
not since my wife died 
what happened to her 
complications during childbirth 
she died two days after vada was born 
did she ever see vada

maybe we can play bingo again sometime 
i m tired of bingo 
maybe we should try that drive in of yours 
good night 
before the class started 
ronda and justin wanted to lead the class
in a group meditation 
that s really cool 
okay  what we re going to do
is send our vibes out into the group 
everybody hold hands and close your eyes 
relax your muscles and take deep breaths 
now  try to feel
what the other person is feeling
without speaking any words 
send out your vibe
and receive the vibes
around you at the same time 
can you feel it 
okay  open your eyes 
what did everybody feel 
i felt mrs  hunsaker s strength 
i can feel that ronda is one with the earth 
she s so cosmically in tune 
so right on  that s exactly what i sent out 
and i felt like you were full
of inner peace and harmony 
vada  what did you feel

tell you what  let s try it again 
hold hands 
gramoo once had a hangnail on her big toe 
it got infected and traveled
to her vocal cords 
ruined her singing voice 
i don t think gramoo thought
it was insignificant 
and some lettuce 
watch out for the rust when you get lettuce

i used to like my ken and barbie dolls 
ken was my favorite 
then one christmas  i got them a camper
and all they wanted to do

so i wasn t too upset when they took that
wrong turn and went over a cliff 
harry  harry  harry  harry  harry  harry

and now look what you ve done

  that s what i do

hi  ralph 
  danny  how did you find me 
  you told everybody where you were going 
  i m here for the motor home 
  no 
these two people
do not have a good relationship 
i ve been living in it for over a year 
the camper is mine 
excuse me   mutual asset  
that s what the lawyer said 
it s supposed to be our mutual asset 
not shelly s recreational vehicle 
  give me the keys 
  keep your voice down   
  why 
  my boss is watching us 
i m impressed 
  god  i guess i have to introduce you now 
  yeah  all right 
this is harry  phil 
gramoo and vada sultenfuss 
vada sultenfuss 
tough break 
i like my name 
this is danny and ralph 
they own the dino raphael salon in detroit 
we used to be married 
are you here to take shelly back 
nice to meet you 
we got burgers and hot dogs here
if you care to join us 
  i can t stay  i m here because my wife   
  ex  ex  ex 
my ex wife seems
to have ripped off my camper 
shelly 
honestly  harry  he got the mustang 
i promise   
i don t think so  in fact  i ve got a copy
of the property settlement right here 
shit  this is my lease 
damn it  i keep forgetting things 
i m getting senile 
  danny 
  what 
okay  i know you ve suffered a terrible loss
and there s really nothing
anyone can do to comfort you 
but i urge you to focus
on the times you had with the camper 
the trips you took  the sights you saw 
those days are gone now 
but they ll live on in your heart forever 
is this guy boinking you 
that s a real bonehead thing to say 
look  you re not going
to take shelly s camper 
no 
  it s her home  it s where she lives 
  oh  really  okay  fine  look  go cook 
give me the goddamn keys 
  stop that  that hurts 
  come on 
danny 
what did you do that for 
  who are you 
  i m his brother 
then you ll probably be visiting us here
quite often 
why 
because if he ever tries
to take shelly s camper again 
i m going to bury him in my front yard 
your father s a savage 
bye  ralph 
well  you were pretty great 
is it really your camper 
look 
  can you see them from the backyard 
  you can get the general idea 
yeah  there they are 
they always look the same every year 
look 
did you
love him 
i would never marry anybody i didn t love 
he must like shelly 
i never saw him hit anyone in his life 
he likes her 
does he love her 
probably 
do you like her 
yes  i do 
  and i think she s very good for your father 
  why 
after your mother died 
he was sad all the time 
but before that  he was pretty funny 
really 
now when i see him with shelly 
sometimes he seems like the old harry 
my dad was funny 
well  he wasn t one of the marx brothers 
but he made me laugh 
my uncle fought in the korean war 
he had a steel plate put in his head 
daddy said he didn t come back the same 
one night we picked up a radio station
from oklahoma in his teeth 
it was really neat 
  can t you see it 
  what 
  can t you see it 
  no 
it s there 
vada  there is no chicken bone
stuck in your throat 
dr  welty  are you sure those are yours 
so you fill it with water  like this 
and what have you got 
a water gun 
  cool  can i get one for vada 
  yes  yes 
thomas  let me ask you a question 
does vada ever tell you
why she comes down here so much 
 cause she s dying 
  do you think she is 
  no 
why do you think she says that 
because she gets scared
of all those dead people in her house 
and you know that saying 
 can t beat them  join them  
well  if she s one of them 
she won t be as scared 
you know what i think 
i think vada s very lucky
to have a friend like you 
she s my best friend 
miss vada  how are you feeling 
as good as can be expected 
hey  vada  guess what we got 
  what 
  this 
hey  you  i m going to get you

  hi  reverend moss 
the sennett s want to thank you
for taking care of things so quickly 
vada 
i see you took your tray in 
maybe you should come down
for the funeral 
sometimes it helps 
vada 
she won t come out 
it s been a whole day 
you have to do something  harry 
the funeral s starting 
open your eyes  she s 11 years old 
her only friend in the world is dead 
i know that  but what do you want from me 
stop hiding  harry 
you run  harry 
when i first came here 
the idea of working with dead people
didn t exactly thrill me 
but when i saw a family lived here 
i thought 
 if i m living without a family 
 at least i can work with one 
 and maybe once in a while
be invited in for supper  
yeah  and when those suppers are disrupted
because there s a car crash  or there s a fire 
or a little boy steps on a beehive 
i m not asking you
to stop feeling for those people 
but life isn t just death  harry 
don t ignore the living 
especially your daughter 
excuse me  harry  shelly 
the minister s about to begin 
thank you  arthur 
we are here to honor thomas james sennett 
he was born may 7  1961
in madison  pennsylvania 
he is survived by his loving parents 
charles and susan sennett 
his grandparents 
william and gloria sennett 
and gerald and marjorie finn 
and many relatives  friends and schoolmates 
the interment will follow
at madison memorial park 
the family has asked me to say a few words
before we proceed to the cemetery 
no words i could say
would begin to express
the loss and grief we feel 
one word that keeps ringing
in my ear is  why  
why would god choose
to take this little boy from us 
well  i can t give you
an answer to that question 
but i can tell you
that god has chosen thomas j 
for some very special reason 
we must find solace
in knowing that thomas j  is in god s care 
in that place  there is no sorrow or suffering 
the lion lies with the lamb 
the day is not divided 
i d like to read a passage from the bible 
this is matthew 19 13 
 at one point  children were brought to him
 that he might lay his hands
on them and pray 
 the disciples began to chastise them 
 but jesus said 
 let the children come to me 
  do not hinder them 
  the kingdom of god
belongs to such as these   
 and he laid his hands on their heads
 before he left that place  
let us pray in silence 
you want to go tree climbing  thomas j 
his face hurts 
and where is his glasses 
he can t see without his glasses 
put his glasses on  put on his glasses 
he was going to be an acrobat 
  he s gone  sweetheart  he s gone 
  get away from me 
vada  wait 
vada 
vada 
vada  i was just on my way to your house 
are you all right 
i m so sorry about thomas j 
okay  we don t have to talk about him 
vada  vada  we don t have to talk about him 
it s okay 
we won t talk about him 
justin and ronda say
that i should tell people what i feel 
come here  sit down  sit down over here 
mr  bixler   
i love you 
vada   
i love you like my dad loves shelly

vada

why do you think
people want to get married 
when you get older  you just have to 
who s that with your dad 
that s my mother 
i m going to be an acrobat when i grow up 
vada 
would you think of me 
if you don t get to marry mr  bixler 
now we re blood brothers for life 
shelly  i m sorry 
but we haven t found her yet 
it s dark  she can t be alone in the dark 
  we ll keep looking 
  we ve been looking since this morning 
  her teacher called and he said   
  i know  i know  you told us 
vada 
are you okay 
oh  god 
i should have told thomas j 
that he was my best friend 
i m sure he knew 
shelly 
i stole some money from your cookie jar
to pay for the writing class 
  it s okay  sweetheart 
  i ll pay you back 
besides  i don t think
i ll ever go to class again 
i ll tell you what 
you dedicate your first book to me 
i ll forget the whole thing 
  i will  i promise 
  okay  get into bed 
  good night 
  good night 
she s here 
did i kill my mother 
what 
the bees killed thomas j 
and i killed my mother 
no  no 
now  sweetie  that wasn t your fault 
things like that aren t anybody s fault 
it just happened 
i found this 
i forgot about that picture 
  where did you find it 
  in the garage 
that little chevy
was your mother s favorite car 
what was my mama like 
she was pretty 
and kind 
and she had your eyes 
boy  did she love to laugh 
sometimes when you laugh 
you sound just like her 
really 
you know what your mother did when she
found out she was going to have you 
she came home
and painted this whole room pink 
she was so sure she would have a little girl 
do you miss her 
yes 
i did  very much  for a long time 
and even now i get a little sad
when i think about a pretty flower
or a beautiful sunset
that your mother would have liked 
i think every time i see or climb a tree
i ll think of thomas j 
that s good 
memories are good  sweetheart 
vada  i m   
i m sorry 
i was trying to keep it from you 
i just couldn t 
you re a good girl  i want you to be happy

mrs  sennett  how are you doing 
some days i think i ll be okay 
others    well  i have
to force myself even to get out of bed 
i know it s crazy 
but sometimes i think
he s just away at summer camp 
how s vada 
she s doing much better  she s just inside 
vada 
  mrs  sennett 
  vada 
i ve been wanting to come over to see you 
thomas j  had this on him 
i thought you might like to have it 
you were such a good friend to him 
i hope you ll still come by and visit me 
i will  i promise 
mrs  sennett 
thomas j  will be all right 
my mother will take care of him 
thank you  vada 
 encased in talent  like a uniform
 the rank of every poet is well known
 they can amaze us like a thunderstorm
 or die so young
 or live for years alone  
my advice to you on our last class 
be a thunderstorm 
what exactly do you mean by that 
i mean 
be dangerous 
and unpredictable 
and make a lot of noise 
vada 
hey 
we missed you  man 
give me a hug 
i was hoping you d stop by today 
can t stay  i just came to read my poem 
we d love to hear it 
 weeping willow
with your tears running down
 why do you always weep and frown 
 is it because he left you one day 
 is it because he could not stay 
 on your branches he would swing
 do you long for the happiness
that day would bring 
 he found shelter in your shade
 we thought his laughter would never fade
 weeping willow  stop your tears
 for there is something to calm your fears
 you think death
has ripped you forever apart
 but i know he ll always be in your heart  
  hi  judy 
  vada 
things are a little better these days
