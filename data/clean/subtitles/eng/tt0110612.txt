this afternoon 
  lt s disgusting 
  l told you he was french 
  l wish l had an accent 
  give me that 
patty  you ve described
your life at home   
nicole 
  living hell 
  what happened when you were 17 
  nicole 
that s when i went to live
with dwayne 
my mother s a prostitute
and my father s doing time
for armed robbery 
i d have done anything
to get out of there 
  nicole 
  what 
come here and look 
  look at what 
  the moon 
  what about it 
  lt s rising 
great 
    learned to sniff model glue 
  lt s magnificent 
turn that off
and come here and look at it 
ln a minute 
hurry up 
hold on  it s not going anywhere 
get out here and look at
the goddamn moon  lt s glorious 
lt s not like l ve never seen
the moon before 
where is it 
lt ll be out again in a minute 
  where are you going 
  for a walk 
lt s pretty  isn t it 
  hi 
  what are you doing 
going for a walk  you 
  l was on my way home 
  want some company 
sure 
i miss you  andre 
but i ve decided i can t go on
feeling that you re not there for me 
i need more  or maybe less 
i don t know 
i need an answer  that s all 
so  he s like your sugar daddy 
yeah  sort of 
  he saved me 
  from what 
from my boyfriend dwayne 
from a life on the streets 
when l met andre  l was a runaway 
l was into dope pretty bad 
reallyyou were 
well  l started with the easy stuff 
you know  like sniffing glue 
stuff like that 
then l went to the hard stuff 
l was stealing to support my habit
and l got busted 
that s when andre found me 
he turned my life around 
so  he s like a father to you 
you could say that  yeah 
  thank you 
  thanks 
have you met any nice men yet 
besides youno 
  what about them 
  oh  them 
the men that god forgot 
l m not interested 
you re very attractive  you know 
lf l were not already spoken for   
and how is the person
who s speaking for you 
lsabel 
she s angry at me for some reason 
then she disappears because
she said she can t think in paris 
what does she mean 
she can t think in paris 
descartes thought in paris 
so did rousseau and jean paul sartre 
lt was good enough for them 
she probably just needs
to get away from you for a while 
l don t understand women 
so  what is it about us
that you don t understand 
everything  everything 
l don t understand
my ex wife or my lover 
and l especially do not understand
my daughter  she hates me 
don t be silly  niki idolises you 
my father 
he s in prison for armed robbery 
he knocked off a liquor store  shot
the owner  took customers hostage 
he drove through five states
before they caught him 
  so  has niki ever been in love 
  nicoleln loveof course not 
what does she know about love 
she s too young 
she doesn t know anything about men 
you know 
she thinks
love is like some fairy tale 
my mother s a prostitute 
she ran off with her pimp 
so  what s this guy andre like 
most of the time  he s really nice 
he has a pretty bad temper  though 
and he gets jealous real easy 
he was in jail  too 
you re kidding me 
who am l to criticisewithout andre 
l don t know where l d be right now 
l probably wouldn t even be alive 
that s him 
  hello 
  hello  yourself 
well  l ll be seeing you 
  lf he ever hurts you   
  andrehe would never hurt me 
niki  you don t understand men like
him  prison is a really tough place 
lt was a minimum security prison 
well  still   
l should go 
l don t want to get him upset 
  bye 
  goodbye 
good night  daddy 
good night  nicole 
he s totally taking advantage of her 
she s only 16 years old 
l can t believe that guy tells people
she s his daughter 
l know  she s terrified of him 
she says she isn t  but she is 
that s going to be the easiest score
you ll ever have 
what do you mean 
she s not like going out with
one of the staff girls here 
lf she sleeps with a guy that age 
she ll fall for a guy like you  easy 
you think so 
trust me  this girl s experienced 
she expects that from a guy 
hi

  all you can do is be there for her 
lt might be
the greatest kiss in history 
and it might be a total blowout 
ln fact 
it ll probably be a little of both 
and the only thing you can do
is be there when she needs you 
  and l thought you were a cynic 
  lt s after six  l m off duty
