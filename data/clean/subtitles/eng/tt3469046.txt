get to see a unicorn 
for reals 
if i do  can i bring it home 
please 
ohhh 
yeah  sure 
tell you what 
every unicorn you find 
you can bring it home 
i d better build a big pen  right 
but you know 
there s a chance that
you might not find one 
huh 
i m   
it might not be good
unicorn finding weather 
umm 
they re tricky to find them 
and i don t know 
maybe  just   
maybe unicorns don t really ex   
   explore that part of the woods 
but the man said
a maiden could find one
if she was pure of heart 
and i m pure of heart  right 
the purest 
can we stop talking now 
i need to get to sleep 
goodnight  sweetie 
goodnight  gru 
unicorns i love them 
unicorns i love them 
huh 
aaaah 
i m okay 
uh 
hey 
give that back 
huh 
come on 
guys 
don t leave me 
oh  no 
run 
we ve been waiting a long time 
no  no 
ow 
no 
please  don t 
huh 
gru 
my plane    broke 
oh 
uh 
huh 
buddies  i ve decided 
we re going back to gru 
we re going back to gru 
because i m training for
the big day 
nobody s gonna stop me
 cause i am super sassy 
super sassy  super sassy 
what s today s plan  boss 
what s the plan 
silly robot 
i ll show you the plan 
time to watch a very
special episode of evil bratt
to see exactly what i m going
to do to stupid tinseltown 
this week on evil bratt 
it s a giant evil bratt robot 
open fire 
nice try  coppers 
chew on this 
he s shooting his super sticky
self inflating gum 
run 
gum one 
gum all 
gum one 
gum all 
seriously  how did this show
never win an emmy 
and now  it s your turn
to shine  my diamond 
hey  clive 
i guess you can say our plan
was    out of this world 
now that s entertainment 
come on 
let s make it a reality 
here we are  in the dark
and creepy crooked forest 
in search of the
mythical unicorn 
for some reason 
and here she is 
the fearless unicorn hunter  seeking the   
edith  stop it 
you re gonna scare away the unicorn 
if somehow we actually
find a unicorn 
i m gonna film it
and get rich 
look over there 
wooah 
this is it 
this is where we re gonna see it 
unicorns  here we come 
what s that for 
bait 
duh 
come on 
now all we have
to do is wait 
okay 
this is bratt s lair 
it may not look like much 
but this place is armed
with some of the most high tech
weaponry known to man 
it s considered impenetrable 
but a piece of cake for us 
right  brother 
this is not like stealing lollipops 
whoa 
this security system can detect
an air assault from any direction 
no 
ouch 
no 
ouch 
please  stop 
ouch 
so we ll have to approach low
and close to the water 
next 
then there are these deadly spikes 
ha ha ha ha 
geronimo 
covered with enough poison
to blow your mind    literally 
ouch 
ha ha ha ha ha 
ah   
good to know 
so here s the plan 
you re the getaway driver 
so you ll wait in the boat 
wait  hold on 
wait in the boat 
but    i want to be
in on the actions 
the getaway driver is the
most crucial part of any plan 
do you know how hard it is
doing nothing  touching nothing 
with all of the adrenaline
coursing through your veins 
and you must wait 
can i count on you 
i guess so 
so    i ll climb up the cube
and enter here 
then once i m inside 
i ll find the diamond 
i ve underestimated bratt before 
it s not going to be easy 
i think we can handle it 
dad s villain suits 
this will make us unstoppable 
whoa 
ay  chihuahua 
i call the black one 
it s go time 
hello 
oh  hi 
hello  mother of margo 
i am niko 
i present you with pig to confirm
my engagement to your daughter
