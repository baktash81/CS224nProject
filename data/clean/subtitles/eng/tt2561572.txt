when you cross that threshold   
   and join america s most elite 
anything you desire 
anything you want is yours 
i m ready for it 
you know  i bought an island
in cape verde 
an entire island 
you can too 
i would love to 
we could be island neighbors 
you could swim over
and borrow a cup of gold 
yeah 
you know  and to think
it all started with this 
i still have that computer 
it reminds me
of my humble beginnings 
how i built this company
with my own two hands 
just me  that computer   
   and an  8 million loan from my father 
you really did it all on your own 
very inspiring  sir 
now  listen  i want you to drop
this  sir  nonsense 
you are marrying my daughter 
for pete s sake 
i want you to call me  dad  
really  dad 
  mm hm 
  heh 
that feels very good 
my real father never had time for me 
he shipped me off to boarding school in
london with the murdochs and the bin ladens 
of course  that was before   
i mean  we knew they cheated in soccer 
but  had no idea   
   you know   
but if i could choose a dad   
hey  you know something 
you re family now  kid 
okay  then 
oh  boy 
motherfucker 
  mr  king 
  aah  aah 
take whatever you want 
  please 
  it s the hood 
  hey  it s darnell 
  help 
  help  help 
  stop  mr  king  no 
  oh  dear lord  someone help me 
  stop it  you re being ridiculous 
stop  look at me 
it s me 
i got your keys 
oh 
yes  i see you 
i m sorry  i didn t mean to scare you 
  here you go 
  oh 
  i m sorry 
  thank you 
and  uh  just so you know  i would have
done the same thing if you were white 
that s good to know 
hey  mr  king 
um   
while i got you out here  i just wanna   
i just wanna talk to you for a second 
i ve been washing your
car for two years now   
   and i can tell you re the type of man
who likes the best of everything 
so as owner and ceo
of hollywood luxury bubbles   
   i wanted to offer you
an exclusive platinum lifetime wash card   
   for  30 000 
now  before you say anything   
   think about the type of money
that you ll save with this investment 
well  actually the time value
of money is such that   
   if i were to put that same amount
in my own fund   
   in 23 years  time 
i d have in excess of  3 million 
wow  yeah 
with that rate of return  i could buy
a new car every time it gets dirty 
  isn t that impressive 
  amazing  mr  king 
that s the magic of compounded interest 
you see  i didn t get to where i am today
by asking for handouts 
but by hard work 
and today  that hard work paid off   
   as i was just named partner
in my firm 
mr  king  that is   
  hey  that is amazing 
  thank you so much 
  that is   
  thank you 
that s amazing  mr  king  listen to me 
i m one of the hardest workers
you ll ever meet 
i mean  that s why i m down here
power washing cars every day 
i just felt with this face to face
that you would   
that you would wanna help
a fellow business owner and job creator 
i am helping you  by saying no 
  mr  king  that s   
  that way  you can make it on your own 
okay  mr  king  i have a lot of people
helping me that way already  and    and   
great  then you have a plan for success 
why didn t you tell me that 
you see  everyone 
whether we re born rich or poor   
   or white   
   or miscellaneous   
   who we become   
   is based on our own decisions 
it s simple as that 
you know who else started in a garage 
hewlett packard  so you re in good company 
  and on that note   
  no  mister   
  you don t have to give me that much  mr  king 
  hold on  hold on 
  you don t have to give me that much 
  hold on  there we go 
you really don t need   
there you go 
there s a start

  james king

of fraud and 30 counts of embezzlement 
  that s impossible 
  that s what they all say  get him out of here 
i know  this is some kind of joke

  shit  yeah  get out of the way 
  i swear i don t know what any of this is about 
  mm hm 
don t worry  son  i ll take care of it 
let s go 
  gayle  call my lawyer 
  my party 
looks like you could use
a friend right now 
what the fuck 
the charges are securities fraud
and embezzlement 
  these transaction records prove you re guilty 
  i ve never seen these  these are fakes 
if you go to court 
they re gonna kick your ass  take the plea 
  dad 
  take the plea 
you ll be out in a year
and in the best shape of your life 
no  i have faith that the justice system
will exonerate me 
and that the jury will put aside
their bias and see the truth 
that i didn t steal money from people 
and that i am no bernie madoff 
a verdict is expected today
in the  mini madoff  trial of james king 
i lost everything  fuck you 
i didn t do it 
for too long 
wealthy white collar offenders like you   
   have gotten a free pass with light
sentences in minimum security prison   
   while working americans have suffered 
well  that ends today  mr  king 
i sentence you
to the harshest penalty allowed 
ten years in a maximum security prison 
you have 30 days
to get your affairs in order 
just run them over 
i can t go to jail  i ll die in there 
that s not gonna happen  james 
because i m gonna put my investigators   
   on this twenty four seven
until we find out who really did this 
just stay in county lines
with that thing on 
otherwise  the u s  marshals
will be down there pronto 
son  i want you to stay strong

why do you look like that 
just eat your fucking salads 
i ll fucking kill you if you say anything 
hi

  hi 
i came up with a great idea 
let s just run away  some place
that no one would ever think to find us 
mexico 
let s just leave this
material world behind 
live in a one bedroom shack 
  oh  god 
  yes 
  you could sell chiclets on the road

let s go 
  james  no

  i lost everything because of you 
  i didn t do it

for the love of alan greenspan 
fuck  my life is ruined 
i venture you ve heard
that i m going to prison 
yeah  no  we all did  i just didn t
wanna bring it up first  that s all 
come on  they re probably sending you
to some club fed prison 
you ll be playing tennis and golf  you know 
  i m going to be attending san quentin 
  they re sending you to san quentin 
oh 
  what 
  oh  god

  oh 
  everybody gets the dick 
i don t want it 
you re not gonna get it 
you ll be in for three months 
i m gonna be there for 10 years 
goddamn  ten years 
  oh  oh 
  why do you say it like that 
it s not as bad as i ve heard  is it 
if you heard everybody fucking  it is 
that s how bad it is 
i didn t hear that part 
they might as well call it
san fucking  man 
i don t wish that on my worst enemy 
you talking about bad  that s bad 
you should know 
i m sorry to remind you 
what are you talking about 
well  the fact that you went to prison 
the fact that i went to prison 
yes  look  you did your time 
you paid your debt  and we as society   
   should welcome you back  and we do 
you and i are exactly the same 
except you can t vote  ever 
just before i get to another level of anger 
mr  king  tell me for giggles   
     how do you know i went to prison 
  it s simple 
statistical analysis is what i do 
here s the deal 
one out of three black men will find
themselves incarcerated during their lifetime 
  imagine a pizza  okay 
  okay 
there are three pieces 
three black pieces 
one of those pieces of pizza will be thrown
in jail at some point during it s life 
you know what 
let me give you my statistical analysis 
you going to san quentin 
there s 100 percent chance   
   that you re gonna be somebody s bitch 
ten years of this 
  you know what that is 
  mm mm 
a big ass black man
on your pale white ass 
you   no  i don t want any more 
stop  that s enough  
too late  he done tagged the next guy in 
that s like a rabbit 
you don t want him no more   
   so now here comes the guy
that wants to rub your face 
 i like his hair   he s breathing on you 
that s disgusting  but guess what 
you can look forward to 10 years of it 
what if i speak to all the bitches
and we organize   
   form a union  and we put our feet down
and say   enough  
  there s gotta be more of us than them 
  there s not 
you deserve everything you re getting 
good luck on survival  sir 
better luck on handling yourself 
wait  wait  wait  don t leave 
don t leave  please  i could use your help 
help you with what 
help me to not be someone s bitch 
you expect me to help you 
i m supposed to teach you what 
how to prevent this 
  all right  stop 
  you could train me 
you could be the athena to my odysseus 
i don t even know
what the fuck that is  man 
i could pay you 
whatever it takes 
i need  30 000 
  done

thank you  jesus 
i knew it  i knew my day would come 
i m getting the house 
i m getting the house  unh 
babe  this does not make any sense 
why would he hire you 
  because he thinks i went to prison  babe 
  that s the part i don t get 
  why would you tell him that 
  i didn t  he assumed that 
  he assumed it 
  yes 
so what reason did you give him
to assume that you went to jail 
i was being black 
  this is nuts 
  okay  i don t get what s nuts to you 
in 30 days  we ll have the money  the house
will be ours  what is the problem 
the problem is he is never going to believe
that you went to jail 
look  babe  i am your wife 
so i will put it to you straight 
you are not exactly a thug 
i don t have to be a thug to portray a thug 
okay

hi  dad 
it s james 
just wondering if there s any word
from the investigators

thank you  bye 
now  i heard a crazy story about you 
this guy james king 
and i heard that you played at the party
where he got arrested 
yeah  i had no idea
that i was performing for a monster 
i don t know how to explain what it s like
to take money from someone like that 
it makes you wanna give it back to them   
   except that would be worse
because then they d have it 
and it s that whole helpless feeling that i have
about our creative process being monetized   
   and that s what inspired me
to write this song   
   which is actually available
on itunes tonight at midnight 
  if i can play it 
  great 
i can t see through walls
and i can t read your mind
but if i did i d find
that man james king is a great big turd
i mean the small  small kinds
but that      james
will fall
hands against the prison wall
choking on a mouthful of balls
he ll be choking on
a mouthful of balls
i hate to admit it  but it s a good song 
okay  very nice  john mayer  everybody 
now i m gonna be dreaming about balls

asking you for  just start from the beginning 
no  no  like  the beginning  the beginning

russell  i m sorry

prison school is in session  bitch 
you already failing 
i m so glad i hired you 
this is just what i need 
okay  what s next 
what the     
how many motherfuckers live here  
all right  let s get started 
this right here is
my prison readiness program 
if you follow this guide and do exactly
what i say you will survive in prison 
 keistering  
  what s keistering 
  slow down  you ain t ready for that 
you re the teacher 
and i just want you to know i ll do whatever
it takes to survive and get my life back 
that s good 
because let me tell you something 
you re gonna have to work harder
than you ever worked before 
back when i was in harvard business school 
i was facing some pretty long odds 
but i buckled down and i succeeded 
when you was at harvard 
did you ever get raped for failing a test 
i think that s more of a yale thing 
   yale  
  i m sorry 
shut the fuck up 
now from this point on 
this ain t your house no more 
  this san quentin  you understand me 
  okay 
from now on this will be your cell 
you do not leave this room
without my permission 
it s good 
  for you to sleep on  señor 
  go on  we ain t got time for games 
go upstairs 
turn this place into prison 
it will be our pleasure to repay you
for your many kindnesses 
put that in there in front of the statues
with the dicks 
james  listen to me 
the key to survival in prison lies
in the following simple questions 
are you hard 
and can you handle yourself 
well  this is a rare moment for optimism because
the answer to that is a resounding yes 
that s good  let me see
what your mad dog face look like 
  i m sorry  what s a mad dog 
  you a mad dog 
  oh  shit 
  what s your what  nigga 
  take whatever you want 
  let me see that 
no 
  stop  i beg of you 
  like a pit bull with no leash 
that s a mad dog 
wow  i knew you were the right guy
for the job 
in prison  a mad dog face is essential to
your survival  do you understand me  james 
so the idea is that i make a face that conveys
the fact that i d have no problem hurting you 
exactly what it is 
now  convey that shit  let me see it 
okay  ahem 
ha 
  that s terrible 
  ha  ha 
no  that s horrible  man  anger 
you gotta show me anger 
  why you smiling

  that s your mad    that s it  
  your fiancée left you 
  that s right 
  you happy about that 
  no 
then get mad  she gonna leave you 
what is she doing 
she probably on her knees sucking
somebody dick in the back seat of a truck 
show   
james 
oh  oh  come on  come on 
  i miss her so much 
  what the fuck are you doing  james 
i m sad dogging you

that could work 
hey  listen up  everyone

hello  this is james 
hey  it s me  darnell

   and it might be a good idea to get
you extra protection on the inside 
so tomorrow we re gonna go over
to my cousin russell s house  now listen 
russell and his friends 
they re different dudes 
very suspicious of outsiders 
you walking in there  they re probably
gonna think you a cop off the bat

multifaceted subculture

however  from the sound of cnn
and the looks of the wall street journal   
   and everybody else with eyes and ears go
to get they news  you broke  motherfucker 
your assets have been frozen
with no chances of thawing anytime soon 
so you probably got as much or less

been forced to listen to a black man 
you know  maybe you guys
should just calm the fuck down 
black people ain t trying to hurt you 
i mean  technically  i am right now 
but that s only because of what you
were trying to do to the white guy 
think about that 
google  i have a dream   assholes 
it s a teachable moment here  people 
should burn everybody in here 
run  james 
  oh  shit 
  bring me their fucking heads 
run  james  run 
what the fuck
are you knocking over the bike for   run 
oh  god 
you just couldn t say  nigger   huh

  no 
  motherfuckers 
  it s nazi titties 
  and they re huge 
get out 
oh  shit 
  whoa 
  bitch  get your white ass off

how about we make a toast
to escaping fucking nazis 
yes  heh 
you really are innocent  aren t you 
yes 
  absolutely 
  okay  so james  if that s the case   
   then why aren t you trying to find
the guy that framed you 
we are 
who are 
now  martin has a team of investigators
working around the clock 
he s keeping me up to date 
but the million dollar question is 
  who falsified my transaction records 
  all right  lay it on me 
all right  now  this is very complicated
to follow 
i don t expect you to get it on the first pass 
so listen very carefully 
the one thing you need to understand
at the wealthrop fund   
   is that everything
flows through martin 
  okay 
  okay
any sort of contact
with the clearing house  the traders   
   access to trading records
and client information   
   international accounts  institutions   
   and  of course  the doling out
of commissions all goes through martin 
  so it s martin 
  no 
are you fucking ki    
it s common sense  james 
look  all arrows point to martin 
the only name on the board
is fucking martin 
martin  martin  martin 
come on  james  you need to focus 
you re going to prison
unless you can prove that martin did it 
we d need to get a hold
of the master records   
   which is a log of all transactions
made by anyone in the firm 
  okay  how do we get it 
  martin has the original copy   
   on the same computer that he had
when he started the company 
you got to be the dumbest genius i ve   
get up  james

good luck charm  my ass 
it has no connection to the outside world 
no emails  no internet  no trace

that s what we need 
this will clear my name
