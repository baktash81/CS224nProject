you know and to think
it all started with this
i still have that computer
it reminds me
of my humble beginnings
how i built this company
with my own two hands
just me that computer
and an 8 million loan from my father
you really did it all on your own
very inspiring sir
now listen i want you to drop
this sir nonsense
you are marrying my daughter
for petes sake
i want you to call me dad

that feels very good
my real father never had time for me
he shipped me off to boarding school in
london with the murdochs and the bin ladens
of course that was before
i mean we knew they cheated in soccer
but had no idea
you know
but if i could choose a dad
hey you know something

and i can tell youre the type of man
who likes the best of everything
so as owner and ceo
of hollywood luxury bubbles
i wanted to offer you
an exclusive platinum lifetime wash card
for 30000
now before you say anything
think about the type of money
that youll save with this investment
well actually the time value
of money is such that
if i were to put that same amount
in my own fund
in 23 years time
id have in excess of 3 million
wow yeah
with that rate of return i could buy
a new car every time it gets dirty
isnt that impressive
amazing mr king
thats the magic of compounded interest
you see i didnt get to where i am today
by asking for handouts
but by hard work
and today that hard work paid off
as i was just named partner
in my firm
mr king that is
hey that is amazing
thank you so much
that is
thank you
thats amazing mr king listen to me
im one of the hardest workers
youll ever meet

that you would
that you would wanna help
a fellow business owner and job creator
i am helping you by saying no

that way you can make it on your own
okay mr king i have a lot of people
helping me that way already and and
great then you have a plan for success

dad
take the plea
youll be out in a year
and in the best shape of your life
no i have faith that the justice system
will exonerate me

their bias and see the truth
that i didnt steal money from people
and that i am no bernie madoff
a verdict is expected today
in the minimadoff trial of james king
i lost everything fuck you

wealthy whitecollar offenders like you

sentences in minimumsecurity prison

ten years in a maximumsecurity prison
you have 30 days
to get your affairs in order
just run them over
i cant go to jail ill die in there

should welcome you back and we do
you and i are exactly the same
except you cant vote ever
just before i get to another level of anger
mr king tell me for giggles
how do you know i went to prison
its simple
statistical analysis is what i do
heres the deal
one out of three black men will find
themselves incarcerated during their lifetime
imagine a pizza okay
okay
there are three pieces
three black pieces
one of those pieces of pizza will be thrown
in jail at some point during its life
you know what
let me give you my statistical analysis
you going to san quentin
theres 100 percent chance
that youre gonna be somebodys bitch
ten years of this
you know what that is
mmmm
a bigass black man
on your pale white ass
you no i dont want any more
stop thats enough
too late he done tagged the next guy in
thats like a rabbit
you dont want him no more
so now here comes the guy
that wants to rub your face
i like his hair hes breathing on you
thats disgusting but guess what
you can look forward to 10 years of it
what if i speak to all the bitches
and we organize
form a union and we put our feet down

so what reason did you give him
to assume that you went to jail
i was being black

hi dad

just wondering if theres any word
from the investigators
i still love you
thank you bye
now i heard a crazy story about you
this guy james king
and i heard that you played at the party
where he got arrested
yeah i had no idea
that i was performing for a monster
i dont know how to explain what its like
to take money from someone like that
it makes you wanna give it back to them
except that would be worse
because then theyd have it
and its that whole helpless feeling that i have
about our creative process being monetized
and thats what inspired me
to write this song
which is actually available
on itunes tonight at midnight
if i can play it
great
i cant see through walls
and i cant read your mind
but if i did id find
that man james king is a great big turd
i mean the small small kinds
but that  james
will fall
hands against the prison wall
choking on a mouthful of balls
hell be choking on
a mouthful of balls
i hate to admit it but its a good song
okay very nice john mayer everybody
now im gonna be dreaming about balls

what i say you will survive in prison
keistering
whats keistering
slow down you aint ready for that
youre the teacher
and i just want you to know ill do whatever
it takes to survive and get my life back
thats good
because let me tell you something
youre gonna have to work harder
than you ever worked before
back when i was in harvard business school
i was facing some pretty long odds
but i buckled down and i succeeded
when you was at harvard
did you ever get raped for failing a test
i think thats more of a yale thing
yale
im sorry
shut the fuck up
now from this point on
this aint your house no more
this san quentin you understand me
okay
from now on this will be your cell
you do not leave this room
without my permission
its good
for you to sleep on señor
go on we aint got time for games
go upstairs
turn this place into prison
it will be our pleasure to repay you
for your many kindnesses
put that in there in front of the statues
with the dicks
james listen to me
the key to survival in prison lies
in the following simple questions
are you hard
and can you handle yourself
well this is a rare moment for optimism because
the answer to that is a resounding yes
thats good let me see
what your maddog face look like
im sorry whats a mad dog
you a mad dog

no
stop i beg of you
like a pit bull with no leash
thats a mad dog
wow i knew you were the right guy
for the job
in prison a maddog face is essential to
your survival do you understand me james
so the idea is that i make a face that conveys
the fact that id have no problem hurting you
exactly what it is
now convey that shit let me see it

you extra protection on the inside
so tomorrow were gonna go over
to my cousin russells house now listen
russell and his friends
theyre different dudes
very suspicious of outsiders
you walking in there theyre probably
gonna think you a cop off the bat

hiphop is a very sophisticated
multifaceted subculture

behind it with two commas separating them
however from the sound of cnn
and the looks of the wall street journal

to get they news you broke motherfucker
your assets have been frozen
with no chances of thawing anytime soon
so you probably got as much or less
than this little nogood manipulative
degenerate motherfucker

okay so james if thats the case
then why arent you trying to find

we are
who are
now martin has a team of investigators
working around the clock
hes keeping me up to date

who falsified my transaction records
all right lay it on me
all right now this is very complicated
to follow
i dont expect you to get it on the first pass
so listen very carefully
the one thing you need to understand
at the wealthrop fund
is that everything
flows through martin
okay
okay
any sort of contact
with the clearing house the traders
access to trading records
and client information
international accounts institutions
and of course the doling out
of commissions all goes through martin
so its martin
no
are you fucking ki
its common sense james
look all arrows point to martin
the only name on the board
is fucking martin
martin martin martin
come on james you need to focus
youre going to prison
unless you can prove that martin did it
wed need to get a hold
of the master records
which is a log of all transactions
made by anyone in the firm
