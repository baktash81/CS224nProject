okay thank you
l dont know what that means
but thank you
jack
so to solve that problem
l created a lifelike
latex left breast
molded from his mothers
actual left breast
so this way lj would avoid
any nipple confusion
youre avoiding confusion
by strapping a boob on a man
well yes believe it or not
it is less confusing
because of the texture
mom
of the breast itself
uh l guess its very
uh creative
lts very creative
bernie humming

youre what
the ferber method
you let him cry it out
this way he doesnt
depend on coddling

the continuum concept
shows that a baby benefits
more from constant
physical contact

we used the focker method
we hugged and kissed
that little prince
like there was no tomorrow
we fockerized him

his hands are stuck
to the bottle of rum

lts very complicated
lts just a little glue
hes fine

lf he could use his hands

greg

hey
whispering
hows the little guy doing
whispering
everything is
just as good as new
yeah
dad come on
roz
ls he all right
hes asleep
l dont care if they
did call you larry poppins
you are completely unfit
to handle a child
lt was barry poppins
what kind of sick cocktail
were you gonna make
my grandson
jack the babys teething
l told greg to give him
some rum to ease the pain
lt was your idea
yes
what is wrong
with you people
l used to rub bourbon
on dennys gums
yeah look what
happened to him
greg you couldnt follow
a simple set of instructions
jack he was screaming
so l went in and gave him
a little attention okay
hes learning to selfsoothe
these setbacks are disastrous
for his development
the child is adorable
but youre not raising
little buddha over here
mom
what are you saying
lm saying that
lve seen that kid eat
at least 15 boogers
since hes been here
and lve got news for you
jack
prodigies dont eat
their own boogers
and l have news for you
prodigies dont come in
10th place
every time either
okay dad thats my fiance
lm sorry
lve never seen people
celebrate mediocrity
the way you do
because we love our son
we hug our son
lets get down to it
the truth is
youre so concerned about
that little jack but l think
that its the
little jack in you
whos crying out for a hug
the little jack in me
jack you have issues
lm trying to understand
why you run around
with a rubber boob
strapped to your chest
were you ever breastfed
mom stop
key question
my guess is no
spare me
the drugstore psychology
all chattering
everybody all right
everybody just
everybody just stop okay
jack l am not going
to make any excuses yes
little jack wouldnt
stop crying
so l gave him some hugs
and l let him watch tv
l went to answer the phone
l was gone a second
l came back in
he let himself out
of the playpen
he put on scarface
and he glued his hands
to the rum bottle okay
thats it
oh thats it
greg just said thats it
so l feel much better now
daddy would you mind
please daddy he made
an honest mistake let it go
hes fine greg
hes asleep
little jack mumbling
he spoke
little jack
asshole
what
did he say what
l am thinking
l think he did
little jack
what did you just say
asshole

lt just slipped
out of my mouth l
he has a mind like a sponge
thats enough
lm calling
a family conference

your problems

my own family excuse us
ld like to talk to
pam and dina in private
of course of course

this wedding is
such a good idea
to say the least
l dont like what lm seeing
from these fockers
what
has greg ever mentioned
the name jorge to you
jor
l dont know
what youre talking about
no why
because l think
your fiance may have
a few skeletons in his closet
that he is not
telling you about
and skeletons dont like
living in closets
oh my god
here we go again
dad listen
you know
greg has no skeletons okay
oh really
he does not
do you know that
yes l know that
will you just
lm not a child
l see she knows that
this wedding will happen
and the sooner
you accept that
the better its going
to be for all of us
l cant talk to you
no
wait a second sweetheart
and lm not so sure roz
is a yoga instructor either
jack you promised
that youd behave yourself
and what you said
to those people
was really hurtful
l think you should go up there
and apologize
lm not going to apologize
to them
jack
a little birdie told me
that somebodys going to
be a daddy
mom
sorry honey
but look at that face
how could l keep it a secret
hes so excited
about being a grandpa
bernie
what should he call me
both laughing
how about poppy
you dont have
to have champagne okay
why
jacks really angry
l know hes mad
but hes also
a little meshuggenah
come on honey how often do
we get to be grandparents
were having a toast
okay fine
but dad this is a secret
we cant tell jack
till after we are married
why we are honest people
no l cant stand
this secrecy anymore why
shushing
be quiet
why should we diminish our joy
just because they live
in denial
shushing
seriously
l promised pam okay
she thinks
itll break his heart
if he finds out
lm not gonna take a drink
roz
