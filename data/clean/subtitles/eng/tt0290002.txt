oh  well  you know 
actually  we re gonna
stay in our motor home 
ln the trailer 
come on  jack 
you re family 
we sleep under the same roof 
actually  mom s office
is kind of cluttered 
so  that  that
works all right 
lt s just really easier
with little jack 
no  no  really 
we insist 
they wanna sleep
in the trailer 
let them sleep
in the trailer 
mom  it s not actually  
lt s not a trailer 
lt s kind of like  
lt s like a   like a
hotel on wheels 
this is practically a hotel 
l was gonna do
the turndown service  
l know  l know 
but it s their choice 
wherever you feel
most comfortable is fine 
 bernie 
lt s not right 
bern  let it go 
let it go  fine 
yeah  let it go 
look at you  sulking 
now  look at this 
l married a teenager  right

oh  don t you dare 
stop it 
 chuckling 
how about a double feature 
 laughing 
 bernie

 greg 
hey  dad  
lt s going good
so far  right 
dad  you gotta take down
that weird shrine thing 
but l m very proud
of you  gaylord 
what s wrong with showing it 
lt s ridiculous 
most people aren t proud
of sixth place ribbons 
most people 
since when do you care
about most people 
l don t  but jack
is really into winning
and competition and sports 
lt s a whole other thing
with him 
hey  hey  you re a winner
up here and in here 
and that s all that matters 
okay  thank you 
l don t know what that means 
but thank you 
 jack 
so  to solve that problem 
l created a life like
latex left breast
molded from his mother s
actual left breast 
so this way lj would avoid
any nipple confusion 
you re avoiding confusion
by strapping a boob on a man 
well  yes  believe it or not 
it is less confusing
because of the texture
mom 
   of the breast itself 
uh  l guess it s very 
uh  creative 
lt s very creative 
   bernie humming 
a little birdie told me
that one of our guests here
is a tom collins man 
 all laughing 
oh  for pity s sake 
lsn t that nice  jack

 73  honey 
you re right   73 
so  unfortunately 
l never had the chance
to procreate a daughter

little jack back to the room 
l m monitoring him
from a high powered
multidirectional microphone
planted in his crib 
oh  baby monitors 
hidden cameras 
whatever happened
to a little thing
called privacy 
bernie 
surveillance technology
has helped protect

that we as americans
take advantage of today 
he s right 
lt has been good

in a chef s salad 
jack  tell me one smart thing
the clla has done

l think that baby might need
a couple of pulls
on that knocker
of yours  jack 
 both laughing 
no  it s okay 
we re ferberizing him 
you re what 
the ferber method 
you let him cry it out 
this way he doesn t
depend on coddling 
on the other hand 
the continuum concept
shows that a baby benefits
more from constant
physical contact 
oh 
we use the ferber method 
we used the focker method 
we hugged and kissed
that little prince
like there was no tomorrow 
we fockerized him 
that s right 
greggy practically slept
in our bed till he was 10 
oh  my god

greg  how did this happen 
and why are you
wearing antlers 
lt s very complicated 
lt s just a little glue 
he s fine 
he s not fine 
lf he could use his hands 
he d tell you himself 
all right  that s all right 
come on 
little jack  honey

 roz 
ls he all right

l don t care if they

you are completely unfit
to handle a child 
lt was barry poppins 
what kind of sick cocktail
were you gonna make
my grandson 
jack  the baby s teething 
l told greg to give him
some rum to ease the pain 
lt was your idea 
yes 
what is wrong
with you people 
l used to rub bourbon
on denny s gums 
yeah  look what
happened to him 
greg  you couldn t follow
a simple set of instructions 
jack  he was screaming 
so l went in and gave him
a little attention  okay 
he s learning to self soothe 
these setbacks are disastrous
for his development 
the child is adorable 
but you re not raising
little buddha over here 
mom 
what are you saying 
l m saying that
l ve seen that kid eat
at least 15 boogers
since he s been here
and l ve got news for you 
jack 
prodigies don t eat
their own boogers 
and l have news for you 
prodigies don t come in
10th place
every time either 
okay  dad  that s my fiance 
l m sorry 
l ve never seen people
celebrate mediocrity
the way you do 
because we love our son 
we hug our son 
let s get down to it 
the truth is 
you re so concerned about
that little jack  but l think
that it s the
little jack in you
who s crying out for a hug 
the little jack in me 
jack  you have issues 
l m trying to understand
why you run around
with a rubber boob
strapped to your chest 
were you ever breastfed 
mom  stop 
key question 
my guess is no 
spare me
the drugstore psychology 
 all chattering 
everybody  all right 
everybody just   
everybody just stop  okay 
jack  l am not going
to make any excuses  yes 
little jack wouldn t
stop crying
so l gave him some hugs
and l let him watch tv 
l went to answer the phone 
l was gone a second 
l came back in 
he let himself out
of the playpen 
he put on scarface 
and he glued his hands
to the rum bottle  okay 
that s it 
oh  that s it
greg just said    that s it   
so l feel much better now 
daddy  would you mind   
please  daddy  he made
an honest mistake  let it go 
he s fine  greg

 little jack mumbling

did he say what
l am thinking 
l think he did 
little jack

asshole 
his first word 
lt just slipped
out of my mouth  l  
he has a mind like a sponge 
that s enough 
l m calling
a family conference 
oh  it s a great idea  jack 
let s finally get
your problems
out on the table

pam and dina in private 
of course  of course 
take your time 
 roz 
come on  honey 
l m not so sure
this wedding is
such a good idea 
to say the least 
l don t like what l m seeing
from these fockers 
what 
has greg ever mentioned
the name jorge to you 
jor  
l don t know
what you re talking about 
no  why 
because l think
your fiance may have
a few skeletons in his closet
that he is not
telling you about 
and skeletons don t like
living in closets 
oh  my god 
here we go again 
dad  listen 
you know 
greg has no skeletons  okay 
oh  really 
he does not 
do you know that 
yes  l know that 
will you just  
l m not a child 
l see  she knows that 
this wedding will happen 
and the sooner
you accept that 
the better it s going
to be for all of us 
l can t talk to you 
no 
wait a second  sweetheart 
and l m not so sure roz
is a yoga instructor  either 
jack  you promised
that you d behave yourself 
and what you said
to those people
was really hurtful 
l think you should go up there
and apologize 
l m not going to apologize
to them 
jack 
a little birdie told me
that somebody s going to
be a daddy 
mom 
sorry  honey 
but look at that face 
how could l keep it a secret 
he s so excited
about being a grandpa 
 bernie 
what should he call me 
 both laughing 
how about poppy 
you don t have
to have champagne  okay 
why 
jack s really angry 
l know he s mad 
but he s also
a little meshuggenah 
come on  honey  how often do
we get to be grandparents 
we re having a toast 
okay  fine 
but  dad  this is a secret 
we can t tell jack
till after we are married 
why  we are honest people 
no  l can t stand
this secrecy anymore  why 
 shushing 
be quiet 
why should we diminish our joy
just because they live
in denial 
 shushing 
seriously 
l promised pam  okay 
she thinks
it ll break his heart
if he finds out 
l m not gonna take a drink 
 roz 
your father s right 
this is the 21st century 
married or not

in fatherhood 
this is
the fruit of your loins 
 bernie
