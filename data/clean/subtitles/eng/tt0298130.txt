one single case
of a 16yearold girls
heart just stopping
i spoke to three different
doctors and not one of them
could tell me exactly what
happened to my daughter
she was close with you

but she confided in you
yeah but she never
said anything
nothing that would explain
what happened
but you could find out
its what you do isnt it
ask questions

intense but she wasnt crazy

yeah im still here
shh
okay so whats
the time of death
hi i was wondering
pick a card any card
go ahead
okay put it back
dont let me see it
that your card
no
damn
i was wondering
if youd remember someone
from a week ago
was there a problem
its my niece
she sort of ran out
on her parents
no
i have some photos here
thats her and her friends
i think they stayed
here a night or so
yeah they were in cabin 12
they didnt pay
had a number of complaints
about the tv mainly
uh receptions never good here
thats why we bought
tape players for videos
quite a selection
mostly theyre handmedowns
left by other guests
anyway they didnt pay
and kids like that
sometimes dont
miss
you know im kind of tired
im thinking i might take a nap
before i drive back
ill take cabin 12
hey
this is your card right
thats it
seven days
im going to school
hold up
what do you think
well its a pretty cool effect
what does this have to do
with the tape
take my picture
are you going to look at me
at least
this the same camera
no scan the rest
so what do you think
well look i thought you said
this was about a tape
im thinking maybe
you shouldnt see it
no i should know
more about it first
well isnt that why im here
so you can benefit
from my wisdom
four kids are dead noah
not from watching a videotape
come on show it to me
roll credits
that was very student film
im sure its a lot
scarier at night
you going to get that
so you been working a lot
im not tired noah
okay
that tape didnt scare you
no not really sorry
four people are dead
yeah but like i said
not from watching
four people who watched it
come on we watched it
were hanging
it takes a week
right yeah im just
going to go downtown
i got to pick up some
cameras from this guy
and then i got
to prep this thing
that i may end up
doing next week
noah
hmm
would you say that im gullible
no
easily rattled
definitely not
i mean youre a little
highly strung maybe
and you aint much
of a dresser
who made it
whered it come from
all right
make me a copy
ill see what i can do
thanks
yeah
you sure this is a copy
yeah why
the numbers are all screwed up
the same problem
got copied i guess
thats impossible
the numbers of
the control track
they put on the tape
whenever its recorded
which means theoretically
there shouldnt be any images
hey noah can you pretend
for one minute
that i dont read
video geek magazine
okay when you record a tape
the makeup of the tracks
is like a signature
for whatever did the recording
like a camcorder
vcr whatever
so the control track could
tell us where it came from
but to not have one
i mean thats like being born
without fingerprints
then how did this get recorded
i dont know
but im going to find out
all right take a look
you should be able
to see the camera here
in the reflection
the angles straight
on but you dont
hmm whats that
it looks like shes walking away
whoever she is
no i mean up there at the top
oh no thats
just the tracking
i can fix that
whup sorry
wait go back
theres something there
yeah youre right
theres more picture
hold on
im going to stretch
the alignment
yeah its working
yeah it wont go any further
okay keep going
no no no no let me do it
wait it wont go any further
it wont go any further
get
let me do it
shit
oh
hey noah
i picked up the cameras
theyre in really good shape
did you see the reprints i did
of that guatemala stuff
cause they came out kind of
overexposed
you working
this is a friend rachel keller
she writes for the pi
rachel this is beth
my assistant
well i prefer
partner in crime
shes a journalism student
at kirkland actually
well ill stay
out of your way

so you know video
why dont you come take a look
at this thing with the tracking
you know im late
i really should go
yeah but why are you taking
i got to go
its good to meet you
so youre taking the tape
i dont want her to see it

what about me
seeing it
you had no problem
showing it to me
i did have a problem
youre angry
im not angry
oh no what
are you then
in a hurry
look im sorry but im
not going to get all worked up
over some high school rumor
what are you thinking
im thinking this is
the part where i say
youre a flake
never finishes anything
then you say
im an obsessive bitch
needs to lighten up
then i storm out
all pissed off kicking myself
for ever thinking
that you could just
grow up
so why dont we just
cut to that part right now
and save ourselves
a lot of grief
all right

let you stretch it
theres no point really unless
youre talking restoration
archives will come in here
with these crummy old tapes
sometimes
tracks totally shot
servos cant line them up
but the big box heres
a warhorse
totally analog
shell read to the very edge
of your tape
just dont force her or
shell get pissy with you
your tracking your monitor
your printer if you need it

noah said to make one for you
you could almost draw
a line through her life
on one side
theres this happy woman
who spends her time with her
husband riding horses
everything sheltered
protected and comfortable
her face theres light
theres pride
and then one day
something happens
and she takes
this hard corner
and the light goes out
and then she ends up
at eola county psychiatric
all alone
what happened to her
l dont know yet
but l think it has something
to do with the horses
lt think we should go
to the island together
lts tuesday noah
l only have one day left
l need you to go to the
hospital
and find out as much
as you can about anna
the images on the tape
