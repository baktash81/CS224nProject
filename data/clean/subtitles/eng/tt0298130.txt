you know  i heard there s
so many magnetic waves traveling
through the air
because of tv and telephones 
that we re losing  like
ten times as many brain cells
as we re supposed to 
like  all the molecules
in our heads are all unstable

about it

doing anything about it 
it s  like  a big conspiracy

i know they were very close 
aidan and his cousin 
yeah  they spent a few
nights a week together 
did he talk to you
about her death 
well  like you said  he s
not the talkative type 
that doesn t mean
he has nothing to say 
he knows i m there 
yes  i m sure he does
but he may be expressing himself
in    other ways 
i d like to show you something 
that s his cousin 
that s katie 
ms  keller   
i m bothered by these drawings 
listen  i appreciate
your concern
but my son lost his best
friend three nights ago 
he s just trying
to deal with it 
yes  i understand 
but these pictures   
are aidan s way
of working it out   
of expressing himself 
like you said 
he ll be okay 
you say she died
three nights ago 
yeah  that s right 
aidan drew these last week

but i know you don t have
to worry about it 
katie knew

i spent four hours
on the internet
and i couldn t find
one single case
of a 16 year old girl s
heart just stopping 
i spoke to three different
doctors and not one of them
could tell me exactly what
happened to my daughter 
she was close    with you 
and aidan 
but she confided in you 
yeah  but she never
said anything   
nothing that would explain
what happened 
but you could find out 
it s what you do  isn t it  
ask questions 
rachel  please 
i saw her face 
i knew becca 
i mean  she was a little
intense  but she wasn t crazy 
they don t put you in booties
and a straightjacket
if you re just freaked out 
something scared the shit
out of her 
hi 
so  who s
in the mental hospital 
becca   
katie s friend 
oh  right 
she was the one who was   
there when it happened 
so  what do you think
they were doing up there 
oh  thanks 
i remember i was that age 
me and my girlfriend used to
sneak up to my room  get high 
do you think maybe
she was into    
it s not about that 
it s about the tape 
kellen  don t even 
what tape 
the one that kills you
when you watch it 
oh  please 
what was on the tape 
i haven t seen it  obviously 
but katie told you
she saw this tape 
not katie 
i heard it from her boyf

she was dating
this guy josh 
he goes to revere 
it was kind
of a secret 
kind of 
where is he   josh

supposedly  he killed himself   
the same night that katie died 
aidan    what are

10 00 p m 
10 00 p m 
time of death  wade

and read the time 
no  that s okay  i ll hold 
  punctilious prick   
nice alliteration  huh 
you re fired 
no  i m not 
yes  you are 
no  i m not 
i m cooking too good a story 
what is it 
yeah  i m still here 
shh 
okay  so what s
the time of death 
hi  i was wondering   
pick a card  any card 
go ahead 
okay  put it back 
don t let me see it 
that your card 
no 
damn 
i was wondering
if you d remember someone
from a week ago 
was there a problem 
it s my niece 
she sort of ran out
on her parents 
no 
i have some photos here 
that s her and her friends 
i think they stayed
here a night or so 
yeah  they were in cabin 12 
they didn t pay 
had a number of complaints 
about the tv  mainly 
uh  reception s never good here 
that s why we bought
tape players for videos 
quite a selection 
mostly they re hand me downs
left by other guests 
anyway  they didn t pay 
and kids like that
sometimes don t 
miss 
you know  i m kind of tired 
i m thinking i might take a nap
before i drive back 
i ll take cabin 12 
hey 
this is your card  right 
that s it 
seven days 
i m going to school 
hold up 
what do you think 
well  it s a pretty cool effect 
what does this have to do
with the tape 
take my picture 
are you going to look at me
at least 
this the same camera 
no  scan the rest 
so  what do you think 
well  look  i thought you said
this was about a tape 
i m thinking maybe
you shouldn t see it 
no  i should know
more about it first 
well  isn t that why i m here 
so you can benefit
from my wisdom 
four kids are dead  noah 
not from watching a videotape 
come on  show it to me 
roll credits 
that was very student film 
i m sure it s a lot   
scarier at night 
you going to get that 
so  you been working a lot 
i m not tired  noah 
okay 
that tape didn t scare you 
no  not really  sorry 
four people are dead 
yeah  but like i said 
not from watching   
four people who watched it 
come on  we watched it 
we re hanging 
it    takes a week 
right  yeah  i m just
going to go downtown 
i got to pick up some
cameras from this guy
and then i got
to prep this thing
that i may end up
doing next week 
  noah   
  hmm 
would you say that i m gullible 
no 
easily rattled 
definitely not 
i mean  you re a little
highly strung maybe 
and you ain t much
of a dresser 
who made it 
where d it come from 
all right 
make me a copy 
i ll see what i can do 
thanks 
yeah 
you sure this is a copy 
yeah  why 
the numbers are all screwed up 
the same problem
got copied  i guess 
that s impossible 
the numbers of
the control track
they put on the tape
whenever it s recorded
which means theoretically 
there shouldn t be any images 
hey  noah  can you pretend
for one minute
that i don t read
video geek magazine 
okay  when you record a tape
the makeup of the tracks
is like a signature
for whatever did the recording
like a camcorder 
vcr  whatever 
so the control track could
tell us where it came from 
but to not have one   
i mean  that s like being born
without fingerprints 
then  how did this get recorded 
i don t know 
but i m going to find out 
all right  take a look 
you should be able
to see the camera here
in the reflection 
the angle s straight
on  but you don t 
hmm  what s that 
it looks like she s walking away
whoever she is 
no  i mean up there at the top 
oh  no  that s
just the tracking 
i can fix that 
whup  sorry 
wait  go back 
there s something there 
yeah  you re right 
  there s more picture 
  hold on 
i m going to stretch
the alignment 
yeah  it s working 
yeah  it won t go any further 
okay  keep going 
no  no  no  no  let me do it 
wait  it won t go any further 
it won t go any further 
get   
  let me do it 
  shit 
oh   
hey  noah
i picked up the cameras 
they re in really good shape 
did you see the reprints i did
of that guatemala stuff 
 cause they came out kind of   
overexposed 
you working 
this is a friend  rachel keller 
she writes for the   p i   
rachel  this is beth 
my assistant 
well  i prefer
  partner in crime   
she s a journalism student
at kirkland  actually 
well  i ll stay
out of your way 
i m not even here 
rachel is researching a story 
it s this video hoax 
it s sort of interesting 
so you know video 
why don t you come take a look
at this thing with the tracking 
you know  i m late 
i really should go 
yeah  but why are you taking    
i got to go 
it s good to meet you 
so you re taking the tape 
i don t want her to see it 
whoa  you don t
want her to see it 
what about me
seeing it 
you had no problem
showing it to me 
i did have a problem 
you re angry 
i m not angry 
oh  no  what
are you then 
in a hurry 
look  i m sorry  but i m
not going to get all worked up
over some high school rumor 
what are you thinking 
i m thinking this is
the part where i say
  you re a flake 
never finishes anything   
then you say
i m   an obsessive bitch 
needs to lighten up   
then i storm out
all pissed off  kicking myself
for ever thinking
that you could just   
grow up 
so  why don t we just
cut to that part right now
and save ourselves
a lot of grief 
all right 
bye 
watch out  missy 
bad luck 
you don t need that 
becca 
becca 
we re almost there 
summer  actually 
so circle gets that square 
we take a break 
while you check this out 
this is how you can be part   
do you remember anything
about that night   
that night with katie 
do you remember   
how she died 
becca 
she told you about a videotape 
didn t she 
she was afraid  wasn t she

let you stretch it 
there s no point  really  unless
you re talking restoration 
archives will come in here
with these crummy old tapes
sometimes 
tracks totally shot  
servos can t line them up 
but the big box here s
a warhorse 
totally analog 
she ll read to the very edge
of your tape 
just don t force her or
she ll get pissy with you 
your tracking  your monitor 
your printer  if you need it 
so  uh

rachel and i were   
young 
mom s told me that story

it s a conundrum

time to go  mister

noah said to make one for you 
you could almost draw
a line through her life 
on one side 
there s this happy woman
who spends her time with her
husband  riding horses
everything sheltered 
protected and comfortable 
her face  there s    light 
there s pride 
and then  one day 
something happens
and she takes
this hard corner
and the light    goes out
and then she ends up
at eola county psychiatric
