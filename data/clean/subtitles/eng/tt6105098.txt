woman singing in english
from the day we arrive
on the planet
and blinking
step into the sun
theres more to see
than can ever be seen
more to do
than can ever be done
theres far too much
to take in here
more to find
than can ever be found
but the sun rolling high
through the sapphire sky
keeps great and small
on the endless round
its the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
music continues
chorus singing in zulu
sneezes
its the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
birds chirping
sniffing
insect buzzing
sniffing
lifes not fair
is it my little friend
while some are
born to feast
others spend their lives
in the dark
begging for scraps
the way i see it
you and i
are exactly the same
mouse squeaks
we both want to
find a way out
the king approaches
this is not a drill
his majesty has requested
an audience
upon his entrance
you will rise and genuflect
zazu
youve made me lose my lunch
you will answer to mufasa
for missing the ceremony
this morning
i answer to no one
scar scar scar
no no
dont look at me like that
are you hungry zazu
perhaps we could have
a bite together
growls
zazu yelps whimpers
you cant eat me
it is forbidden to eat
a member of the kings court
ow no please stop it
mufasa scar
well look whos come down
to mingle with the commoners
sarabi and i didnt see you
at the presentation of simba
was that today
mustve slipped my mind
of course
i meant no disrespect
towards his majesty or sarabi
as you know i have tremendous
respect for the queen
as the kings brother
you shouldve been
first in line
i was first in line
yelps
or dont you remember
that is until the precious
prince arrived
dont turn your back on me
scar
oh no mufasa
perhaps you shouldnt
turn your back on me
growls
mufasa is that a challenge
i wouldnt dream
of challenging you again
a wise decision
you are no match
for his royalness
well as far as brains go
i got the lions share
but when it comes
to brute strength
im afraid my big brother
will always rule
not always scar
one day
itll be my son who rules
simba will be your king
then long live the king
what am i gonna do with him
zazu oh come on
we both know he shouldve been
expelled from the pride lands
long ago
hes my brother zazu
this is his home
as long as i am king
that will never change
well theres one
in every family sire
i had a cousin who thought
he was a woodpecker
he slammed his head
into trees
and our beaks
arent built for it
he was concussed regularly
oh youve gone
uh sire coming back
birds chirping
buzzing softly
rafiki speaking xhosa
simba
shouting in xhosa
laughing
dad you awake
dad wake up
dad
dad dad dad
your sons awake
before sunrise hes your son
come on dad lets go
you said i could
patrol with you today
and today has started
you promised
you up
yawns
birds chirping
lets do this
chuckling
lets do this
so whats first
give orders for the hunt
chase away evil intruders
dad youre going
the wrong way
growling
dad
im not supposed
to go up here
look simba
everything the light touches
is our kingdom
simba you rule all of that
mufasa yes
but a kings time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun
one day simba
the sun will set
on my time here
and will rise with you
as the new king
all of this will belong to me
it belongs to no one
but will be yours to protect
a great responsibility
simba
everything the light touches
those trees
and the watering hole
and that mountain
and beyond those shadows
you must not go there simba
but i thought a king could do
whatever he wants
take any territory
while others search
for what they can take
a true king
searches for what he can give
everything you see
exists together
in a delicate balance
as king you need to
understand that balance
and respect
all the creatures
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope
simba but dad
dont we eat the antelope
mufasa yes simba
but let me explain
when we die
our bodies become the grass
and the antelope
eat the grass
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life
sire
morning zazu
do you have
the morning report
yes sire clears throat
ten flamingos
are taking a stand
two giraffe
were caught necking
the buzz from the bees
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot
ready for some fun
the birds are tweeting
at 400 in the morning
im like birds we get it
stay low to the ground
i got this
mufasa check the wind
the shadows
and wait for
the perfect moment to pounce
zazu the cheetahs stole
the baboons dinner
and now the baboons
are going ape
of course as i say
cheetahs never prosper
thats what i say
do you get
ill say it again
cheetahs never screams

how weird is that
youve no idea
so your dad showed you
the whole kingdom

beyond the northern borders
no he said i cant go there
ever
and hes absolutely right
an elephant graveyard is
no place for a young prince
an elephant graveyard whoa
oh dear ive said too much
though i suppose youd have
found out sooner or later
you being king and all
youve been there
weve all been there
and its no place for a cub
all those rotting bones
and burning pools
of oozing mud
rotting bones
oozing mud
promise me
youll stay away simba

your majesty
nala come on

zazu come along keep up
lets move in a unit
okay buddy system
so where are we really going
how did you know
you hate the water
i heard
about this place nala
the most incredible
amazing
just tell me where
an elephant graveyard
whoa how far is it
not far just to the shadows
but dont worry
everyones been there
weve never been
that far before
what if we get lost
relax nala
i patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad
theres nothing
to worry about
well there is one thing
we have an imminent threat
something is approaching
oh wait scratch that
thats my own shadow
how we getting rid
of the dodo
trust me i got this

zazu oh how lovely it is
to see the future king
with his future queen
i could just molt

simba you speak bird

to each other
simba ugh

mmmmmm thats not
gonna happen zazu
never ever
nala and i are friends
and besides
shes afraid of rhinos
and hes never eaten
an impala
ive tried it once
we are never
getting married zazu
a monarch
who ignores tradition
with an attitude like that
im afraid youll be
a pretty pathetic king
well im not letting anyone
tell me where to go
what to do
and even who to marry
there will never be a king
like me
simba you cant escape
your destiny
just watch
singing
im gonna be a mighty king
so enemies beware
zazu singing well ive
never seen a king of beasts
with quite so little hair
im gonna be the main event
like no king was before
im brushing up
on looking down
working on my roar
laughs thus far
a rather uninspiring thing
simba oh i just cant wait
to be king
you have rather a long way
to go young master
if you think
simba no one saying do this
zazu now when i said that
nala no one saying be there
zazu what i meant was
simba no one saying
stop that
both no one saying see here
now see here
simba free to run around
all day
zazu well
thats definitely out
free to do it all my way
i think its time
that you and i
arranged a hearttoheart
kings dont need advice
from little hornbills
for a start
if this is where the monarchy
is headed count me out
out of service
out of africa
i wouldnt hang about
this child is getting
wildly out of wing
simba
oh i just cant wait
to be king
both giggling
trumpets

i know what youre thinking
the future king is a genius
you cant be serious
you wouldve never gotten away
without your queen

forgetting something
there is no queen
you could say that again
id rather marry an aardvark
good luck finding one
that will say yes
good luck getting out of here
without a bruising
give it your best shot
grunts

you owe me an apology
grunts never
simba grunting
pinned ya
again
nala stop

youre not gonna trick me
simba
i know that theres nothing
simba this must be it
come on
simba were way
beyond the pride lands
we found it nala
you know what this means
it means we can go home
it means they wont

bubbling
rocks clatter
simba get down
it could be dangerous
danger scoffs
i laugh in the face of danger
laughs
laugh echoes

simba come on

how brave you are
now the sun is going down
im not just

hyenas laughing
hyenas growling
hyenas howl and laugh
well look at this
we werent
expecting guests today
would you two cubs
like to stay for dinner
yeah stay for dinner
cause you look
like a midnight snack
can you just give me
a little bit of space
softly im helping
we have talked
about this before
i come in alone
im the lead distraction
so everyone can circle
okay okay sorry
dont be sorry
just do it
shenzi now this is a meal
ive waited my whole life for
what an unexpected treat
to eat the son of a king
wait a second the king
as in youknowwho
who rules youknowwhere
mufasa does not rule me
you cant do anything to me
cause im the future king
laughs
hes telling me what to do
his fathers strength
flickering inside
i wonder
how all that bravery
will taste
let them go shenzi
they made a mistake
a horrible mistake
but if you do this you will
start a war with mufasa
hyenas and lions
have been at war
since the beginning of time
but mufasas bloodline
will end here
zazu groans run
hyenas laughing
growling
dont let them get away
pants
growls
gasps
simba come on
growls
hyenas growling
growls softly
hyenas laughing
did you hear that
the future king
azizi oh dont hurt me
laughs do it again
growls
mufasa roars
mufasa continues roaring
growling
hyenas whimpering
if you ever come
near my son again
no mufasa never
never again
youve been warned shenzi
softly i thought
you were very brave
mufasa zazu
take nala back to pride rock
zazu yes sire
dont be too hard
on him sire
i remember a cub
a certain headstrong cub
who was always getting
into scrapes
and he achieved
some prominence
did he not sire
i have to teach my son
a lesson
nala come along
mufasa simba
you deliberately disobeyed me
simba i know sighs
mufasa you could
have been killed
and whats worse
you put nala in danger
do you understand
whats at stake
you jeopardized
the future of our pride
i just wanted to show you
i could do it
that i could be brave
like you
im only brave
when i have to be
when theres no other choice
but youre not scared
of anything
i was today
you were
yes i thought
i might lose you
i guess
even kings get scared huh
more than you could ever know
but guess what
what
i think those hyenas
were even scareder
thats cause nobody messes
with your dad
come here
both laughing
continues laughing
dad
uhhuh
were pals right
chuckles right
and well always
be together
right
simba let me tell you
something my father told me
look at the stars
the great kings of the past
look down on us
from those stars
really
yes
so whenever you feel alone
just remember
that those kings
will always be up there
to guide you
and so will i
but i cant see them dad
keep looking son
keep looking
whining softly
mufasa is strong
like way stronger than us
please give me some space
what
you could lay anywhere
in this cave
where do you want me to
i need some personal space
okay
okay
not to take anything away
from you you were great
but he is exhales
see now i know youre
doing this on purpose
very brave too
tough good energy
now youre just
being spiteful
good posture
next time i see mufasa
im gonna teach him a lesson
he will never forget
well youre in luck
hes right behind ya
mufasa
hyenas chattering
thats not the king
you fools have stripped your
land of every living thing
and yet i send
two little cubs your way
and they come back alive
i guess
well have to eat you instead
why eat one meal
when you can be feasting
the rest of your lives
what could you possibly
offer us
a place where you can fill
your bellies
where everything
the light touches
is yours for the kill
the pride lands
are not yours to give
the king controls
those hunting grounds
growling
thats why
were going to kill him
mufasa has always shown
too much restraint
when it comes to hunting
when i am king
the mighty will be free to
take whatever they want
because a hyenas belly
is never full
mufasas far too powerful
to challenge
singing
mufasa is yesterdays message
a clappedout
distracted regime
whose failings
undoubtedly presage
the need for a difrent dream
yes leonine times
are achanging
which means
that hyenas must too
my vision is clear
and wideranging
and even encompasses you
so prepare
for the coup of the century
prepare for the murkiest scam
meticulous planning
tenacity spanning
decades of denial
is simply why ill
be king
undisputed
respected
saluted
and seen for the wonder i am
yes my teeth
and ambitions are bared
be prepared
hyenas be prepared
be prepared
be prepared
be prepared
scar be prepared
be prepared
be prepared
be prepared
scar be prepared
be prepared
yes our teeth and ambitions
are bared
all be prepared
simba my dad was pretty upset
with me
thats why were here simba
i think i know a way for you
to make it up to him
a gift that will make him
forget it ever happened
but hes the king
what could i give him
your roar
my roar
yes echoes
did you hear that
this gorge is where all lions
come to find their roar
all lions
even my dad
even mufasa came here
when he was your age
refused to leave
until his roar could be heard
above the rim
all the way up there
thats when you know
youve found it
with a little practice
youll never be called
a cub again
watch this
roars softly
youll get it simba
just takes time
ill check on you later
dad will be so proud
wont he
its a gift
hell never forget
growls
growls softly
growls
growl echoes
rumbling
mufasa quick
stampede in the gorge
simbas down there
simba
ill find him
grunts
zazu
hold on
help is coming
there he is
on that tree
whimpering
im coming simba
hold on
ill help them zazu
you get the pride

mufasa roars
dad
simba

long live the king
mufasa screaming

scar simba
what have you done
sobs it was a stampede
he tried to save me
it was an accident
i didnt mean for it to
of course you didnt
no one ever means
for these things to happen
but the king is dead
and if it werent for you
hed still be alive
your father had such hopes
for you
gave you so many chances
and this is how you repay him
sobbing i didnt know
i didnt know
scar oh what will
your mother think
a son who causes
his fathers death
a boy who kills a king
what am i gonna do
run
run away simba
run away and never return
kill him
hyenas growling
hyena growls
simba gasps
go down
and make sure hes dead
seriously
oh im sorry
thats a good distance
right there
okay
kamari no little cub
could survive that fall
listen
were gonna tell her
we went down there
and we ate him
uhhuh thats perfect
cause i am starving
were not gonna eat him
simba is dead
thats all she ever
has to know
works for me
scar mufasas death
is a terrible tragedy
the greatest leader
the pride has ever known
to lose a brother
such a deep personal loss
and little simba
who had barely begun to live
a cub whose blood
held our future
its almost too much
to endure
i only wish i had gotten
to the gorge in time
been there to save them
and so it is
with a heavy heart
that i must assume the throne
mufasa and simba are gone
which means i am your king
but i must admit
i cannot bear
this burden alone
and i will need some help
to ensure
the safety of the pride
hyenas chattering
nala stay close
and so from the ashes
of this tragedy
we shall welcome
the dawning of a new era
a great
and glorious future
hyenas chattering laughing

the lions will eat
after the hyenas
and they dont
leave much behind
hyenas growling barking

towards the end of the line
and then one day well reach
the end and thatll be it
timon thats it
line over
timon nothing
pumbaa nada
and you can really
just kinda
do your own thing
and fend for yourself
cause your line doesnt
affect anyone elses lines
youre alive and then
youre not like this guy
mmm

that were all connected
a circle would mean
were all this
that would mean
what i do affects him
