woman   singing in english 
from the day we arrive
on the planet
and blinking
step into the sun
there s more to see
than can ever be seen
more to do
than can ever be done
there s far too much
to take in here
more to find
than can ever be found
but the sun rolling high
through the sapphire sky
keeps great and small
on the endless round
it s the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
 music continues 
 chorus singing in zulu 
 sneezes 
it s the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
 birds chirping 
 sniffing 
 insect buzzing 
 sniffing 
life s not fair   
is it  my little friend 
while some are
born to feast   
others spend their lives
in the dark 
begging for scraps 
the way i see it   
you and i
are exactly the same 
 mouse squeaks 
we both want to
find a way out 
the king approaches 
this is not a drill 
his majesty has requested
an audience 
upon his entrance 
you will rise and genuflect 
zazu   
you ve made me lose my lunch 
you will answer to mufasa
for missing the ceremony
this morning 
i answer to no one 
scar  scar  scar 
no  no 
don t look at me like that 
are you hungry  zazu 
perhaps we could have
a bite together 
   growls 
   zazu yelps  whimpers 
you can t eat me 
it is forbidden to eat
a member of the king s court 
ow  no  please  stop it 
mufasa  scar 
well  look who s come down
to mingle with the commoners 
sarabi and i didn t see you
at the presentation of simba 
was that today 
must ve slipped my mind 
of course
i meant no disrespect
towards his majesty or sarabi 
as you know  i have tremendous
respect for the queen 
as the king s brother 
you should ve been
first in line 
  i was first in line 
   yelps 
or don t you remember 
that is  until the precious
prince arrived 
don t turn your back on me 
scar 
oh  no  mufasa 
perhaps you shouldn t
turn your back on me 
 growls 
mufasa  is that a challenge 
i wouldn t dream
of challenging you again 
a wise decision 
you are no match
for his royalness 
well  as far as brains go 
i got the lion s share 
but when it comes
to brute strength 
i m afraid my big brother   
will always rule 
not always  scar 
one day 
it ll be my son who rules 
simba will be your king 
then long live the king 
  what am i gonna do with him 
  zazu  oh  come on 
we both know he should ve been
expelled from the pride lands
long ago 
he s my brother  zazu 
this is his home 
as long as i am king 
that will never change 
well  there s one
in every family  sire 
i had a cousin who thought
he was a woodpecker 
he slammed his head
into trees 
and our beaks
aren t built for it 
he was concussed regularly 
oh  you ve gone 
uh  sire  coming back 
 birds chirping 
 buzzing softly 
 rafiki speaking xhosa 
simba 
 shouting in xhosa 
 laughing 
dad  you awake 
dad  wake up 
dad 
dad  dad  dad 
your son s awake 
before sunrise  he s your son 
come on  dad  let s go 
you said i could
patrol with you today 
and today has started 
you promised 
you up 
 yawns 
 birds chirping 
  let s do this 
   chuckling 
  let s do this 
  so  what s first 
give orders for the hunt 
chase away evil intruders 
dad  you re going
the wrong way 
 growling 
dad 
i m not supposed
to go up here 
look  simba 
everything the light touches
is our kingdom 
simba  you rule all of that 
mufasa  yes 
but a king s time as ruler   
rises and falls like the sun 
one day  simba   
the sun will set
on my time here   
and will rise with you
as the new king 
all of this will belong to me 
it belongs to no one 
but will be yours to protect 
a great responsibility 
simba 
everything the light touches 
those trees 
and the watering hole 
and that mountain 
and beyond those shadows 
you must not go there  simba 
but i thought a king could do
whatever he wants 
take any territory 
while others search
for what they can take   
a true king
searches for what he can give 
everything you see
exists together
in a delicate balance 
as king  you need to
understand that balance   
and respect
all the creatures   
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope 
simba  but  dad 
don t we eat the antelope 
mufasa  yes  simba 
but let me explain 
when we die 
our bodies become the grass   
and the antelope
eat the grass   
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life 
  sire 
  morning  zazu 
do you have
the morning report 
yes  sire   clears throat 
ten flamingos
are taking a stand 
two giraffe
were caught necking 
the buzz from the bees   
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot 
ready for some fun 
the birds are tweeting
at 4 00 in the morning 
i m like   birds  we get it  
stay low to the ground 
i got this 
mufasa  check the wind 
the shadows   
and wait for
the perfect moment to pounce 
zazu  the cheetahs stole
the baboons  dinner 
and now the baboons
are going ape 
of course  as i say 
cheetahs never prosper 
that s what i say 
do you get   
i ll say it again 
  cheetahs never     screams 
   growls 
 laughs 
come on  it s the news 
 simba giggling 
that s very good 
 both laugh 
sire 
sire 
hyenas in the pride lands 
they re on the hunt 
  where s sarabi 
  she s leading the charge 
zazu  take simba home 
dad  let me come  i can help

 sighs  great 
   laughter 
   indistinct chatter 
 growls softly 
 growls 
scar  if you wish
to kill something   
you might want
to stay downwind 
i know how to hunt 
uncle scar 
well  let s hope we re never
attacked by a beetle 
go back to your den  simba 
i don t babysit 
babysit  i m gonna be the king
of pride rock 
my dad showed me
the whole kingdom 
said i m going to rule it all 
is that so 
think about it 
when i m king 
i ll have to give you orders 
tell you what to do 
how weird is that 
you ve no idea 
so  your dad showed you
the whole kingdom 
did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders 
no  he said i can t go there 
ever 
and he s absolutely right 
an elephant graveyard is
no place for a young prince 
an elephant graveyard  whoa 
oh  dear  i ve said too much 
though i suppose you d have
found out sooner or later   
you being king and all 
you ve been there 
we ve all been there 
and it s no place for a cub 
all those rotting bones   
and burning pools
of oozing mud 
rotting bones 
oozing mud 
promise me
you ll stay away  simba 
now  you run along 
and remember   
it s our little secret   
your majesty 
nala  come on 
we have to go 
  where 
  watering hole 
simba  she s having her bath 
and it s time for yours 
but  mom   
i can do it myself 
hold still 
you re messing up my mane 
come on  behind the ears 
 sighs  come on  mom 
see  all clean  can we go 
there s no hyenas 
you just chased them all off 
just to the watering hole
and no further 
and stay downwind 
and one more little thing 
zazu will be going with you 
both  zazu 
sarabi  zazu goes   
or you don t 
zazu  come along  keep up 
let s move in a unit 
okay  buddy system 
so  where are we really going 
how did you know 
you hate the water 
i heard
about this place  nala 
the most incredible 
amazing   
just tell me where 
an elephant graveyard 
whoa  how far is it 
not far  just to the shadows 
but don t worry 
everyone s been there 
we ve never been
that far before 
  what if we get lost 
  relax  nala 
i patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad 
there s nothing
to worry about 
well  there is one thing 
we have an imminent threat 
something is approaching 
oh  wait  scratch that 
that s my own shadow 
how we getting rid
of the dodo 
trust me  i got this 
follow me to freedom 
zazu  oh  how lovely it is   
to see the future king
with his future queen 
i could just molt 
what do you mean 
 future queen  
well  one day the two of you
will be betrothed 
intended  affianced 
simba  you speak bird 
married 
come on 
one day you will be married 
to each other 
simba  ugh 
nala  ew 
mmm mmm  that s not
gonna happen  zazu 
never ever 
nala and i are friends 
and besides 
she s afraid of rhinos 
and he s never eaten
an impala 
i ve tried it once 
we are never
getting married  zazu 
a monarch
who ignores tradition 
with an attitude like that 
i m afraid you ll be
a pretty pathetic king 
well  i m not letting anyone
tell me where to go 
what to do   
and even who to marry 
there will never be a king
like me 
simba  you can t escape
your destiny 
just watch 
 singing 
i m gonna be a mighty king
so enemies beware
zazu   singing  well  i ve
never seen a king of beasts
with quite so little hair
i m gonna be the main event
like no king was before
i m brushing up
on looking down
working on my roar
 laughs  thus far
a rather uninspiring thing
simba  oh  i just can t wait
to be king
you have rather a long way
to go  young master 
if you think   
simba  no one saying  do this 
zazu  now  when i said that   
nala  no one saying  be there 
zazu  what i meant was   
simba  no one saying
 stop that 
both  no one saying  see here 
now see here 
simba  free to run around
all day
zazu  well 
that s definitely out 
free to do it all my way
i think it s time
that you and i
arranged a heart to heart
kings don t need advice
from little hornbills
for a start
if this is where the monarchy
is headed  count me out
out of service
out of africa
i wouldn t hang about
this child is getting
wildly out of wing
simba 
oh  i just can t wait
to be king
 both giggling 
   trumpets 
   laughing 
simba 
i can t see you  simba 
you must be in my sight
at all times

 chittering 
  i know what you re doing 
   both laughing

you can t hide from me  simba 
it is my sworn duty
to keep you safe 
  you listen to me right now 
   nala giggles 
i m sorry to flutter about
in your face

he s a little lion 
he s small 
but he s cute 
 meerkats chattering 
simba   singing 
everybody look left
nala  everybody look right
simba  everywhere you look i m
both 
standing in the spotlight
not yet 
animals  let every creature go
for broke and sing
let s hear it in the herd
and on the wing
zazu  i see you down there 
i see you down there 
it s gonna be king simba s
finest fling
oh  i just can t wait

zazu  simba 
he just can t wait to be king
oh  i just can t wait
just can t wait
to be king
zazu  i ve lost him 
mufasa s gonna have
my feathers 
this is not good 
 both laughing 
simba  we really lost him 
i know what you re thinking 
 the future king is a genius  
you can t be serious 
you would ve never gotten away
without your queen 
aren t you
forgetting something 
there is no queen 
you could say that again 
i d rather marry an aardvark 
good luck finding one
that will say yes 
good luck getting out of here
without a bruising 
give it your best shot 
 grunts 
pinned ya 
you owe me an apology 
 grunts  never 
 simba grunting 
pinned ya 
again 
nala  stop 
what is that 
you re not gonna trick me 
simba 
i know that there s nothing   
simba  this must be it 
come on 
simba  we re way
beyond the pride lands 
we found it  nala 
you know what this means 
it means we can go home 
it means they won t
treat us like cubs anymore 
 bubbling 
 rocks clatter 
simba  get down 
it could be dangerous 
danger   scoffs 
i laugh in the face of danger 
 laughs 
 laugh echoes 
cool 
   echoing 
  you hear that  nala 
simba  come on 
you ve proved
how brave you are 
now the sun is going down 
i m not just
gonna sit here and   
 hyenas laughing 
 hyenas growling 
 hyenas howl and laugh 
well  look at this 
we weren t
expecting guests today 
would you two cubs   
like to stay for dinner 
yeah  stay for dinner 
 cause you look
like a midnight snack 
can you just give me
a little bit of space 
 softly  i m helping 
we have talked
about this before 
i come in alone 
i m the lead distraction
so everyone can circle 
okay  okay  sorry 
don t be sorry 
just do it 
shenzi  now  this is a meal
i ve waited my whole life for 
what an unexpected treat 
to eat the son of a king 
wait a second  the king 
as in you know who 
who rules you know where 
mufasa does not rule me 
you can t do anything to me 
 cause i m the future king 
 laughs 
he s telling me what to do 
his father s strength
flickering inside 
i wonder   
how all that bravery
will taste 
let them go  shenzi 
they made a mistake 
a horrible mistake 
but if you do this  you will
start a war with mufasa 
hyenas and lions
have been at war
since the beginning of time 
but mufasa s bloodline
will end here 
zazu   groans  run 
 hyenas laughing 
 growling 
don t let them get away 
 pants 
   growls 
   gasps 
simba  come on 
 growls 
 hyenas growling 
 growls softly 
 hyenas laughing 
did you hear that 
the future king 
azizi  oh  don t hurt me 
 laughs  do it again 
   growls 
   mufasa roars 
 mufasa continues roaring 
   growling 
   hyenas whimpering 
if you ever come
near my son again   
no  mufasa  never 
never again 
you ve been warned  shenzi 
 softly  i thought
you were very brave 
mufasa  zazu 
take nala back to pride rock 
zazu  yes  sire 
don t be too hard
on him  sire 
i remember a cub 
a certain headstrong cub   
who was always getting
into scrapes 
and he achieved
some prominence 
did he not  sire 
i have to teach my son
a lesson 
nala  come along 
mufasa  simba 
you deliberately disobeyed me 
simba  i know   sighs 
mufasa  you could
have been killed 
and what s worse 
you put nala in danger 
do you understand
what s at stake 
you jeopardized
the future of our pride 
i just wanted to show you
i could do it 
that i could be brave
like you 
i m only brave
when i have to be 
when there s no other choice 
but you re not scared
of anything 
i was today 
you were 
yes  i thought
i might lose you 
i guess
even kings get scared  huh 
more than you could ever know 
  but guess what 
  what 
i think those hyenas
were even scareder 
that s  cause nobody messes
with your dad 
come here 
 both laughing 
 continues laughing 
  dad 
  uh huh 
  we re pals  right 
   chuckles  right 
and we ll always
be together   
right 
simba  let me tell you
something my father told me 
look at the stars 
the great kings of the past   
look down on us
from those stars 
  really 
  yes 
so whenever you feel alone   
just remember
that those kings   
will always be up there
to guide you 
and so will i 
but i can t see them  dad 
keep looking  son 
keep looking 
 whining softly 
mufasa is strong 
like  way stronger than us 
  please give me some space 
  what 
you could lay anywhere
in this cave 
  where do you want me to   
  i need some personal space 
  okay 
  okay 
not to take anything away
from you  you were great 
but he is     exhales 
see  now i know you re
doing this on purpose 
very brave  too 
tough  good energy 
now you re just
being spiteful 
good posture 
next time i see mufasa   
i m gonna teach him a lesson
he will never forget 
well  you re in luck 
he s right behind ya 
mufasa 
 hyenas chattering 
that s not the king 
you fools have stripped your
land of every living thing 
and yet i send
two little cubs your way   
and they come back alive 
i guess
we ll have to eat you instead 
why eat one meal   
when you can be feasting
the rest of your lives 
what could you possibly
offer us 
a place where you can fill
your bellies 
where everything
the light touches
is yours for the kill 
the pride lands
are not yours to give 
the king controls
those hunting grounds 
 growling 
that s why
we re going to kill him 
mufasa has always shown
too much restraint   
when it comes to hunting 
when i am king   
the mighty will be free to
take whatever they want 
because a hyena s belly
is never full 
mufasa s far too powerful
to challenge 
 singing 
mufasa is yesterday s message
a clapped out 
distracted regime
whose failings
undoubtedly presage
the need for a dif rent dream
yes  leonine times
are a changing
which means
that hyenas must too
my vision is clear
and wide ranging
and even encompasses you
so prepare
for the coup of the century
prepare for the murkiest scam
meticulous planning
tenacity spanning
decades of denial
is simply why i ll
be king
undisputed
respected
saluted
and seen for the wonder i am
yes  my teeth
and ambitions are bared
be prepared
  hyenas  be prepared
  be prepared
be prepared
be prepared
  scar  be prepared
  be prepared
be prepared
be prepared
scar  be prepared
be prepared
yes  our teeth and ambitions
are bared
all  be prepared
simba  my dad was pretty upset
with me 
that s why we re here  simba 
i think i know a way for you
to make it up to him 
a gift that will make him
forget it ever happened 
but he s the king 
what could i give him 
your roar 
my roar 
yes   echoes 
did you hear that 
this gorge is where all lions
come to find their roar 
all lions 
even my dad 
even mufasa came here
when he was your age 
refused to leave   
until his roar could be heard
above the rim 
all the way up there 
that s when you know
you ve found it 
with a little practice   
you ll never be called
a cub again 
watch this 
 roars softly 
you ll get it  simba 
just takes time 
i ll check on you later 
dad will be so proud 
won t he 
it s a gift
he ll never forget 
 growls 
 growls softly 
 growls 
 growl echoes 
 rumbling 
mufasa  quick 
stampede in the gorge 
simba s down there 
simba 
i ll find him 
 grunts 
zazu 
hold on 
help is coming 
there he is 
on that tree 
 whimpering 
i m coming  simba 
hold on 
i ll help them  zazu 
you get the pride 
go 
 mufasa roars 
dad 
simba 
come to me  son 
jump 
 roars 
   mufasa grunts 
  dad 
scar 
help me 
 growls 
 roars 
long live the king 
 mufasa screaming 
no 
dad 
 echoes 
dad 
dad 
 crying  dad 
come on  wake up 
help  somebody help 
scar  simba 
what have you done 
 sobs  it was a stampede 
he tried to save me 
it was an accident 
  i didn t mean for it to   
  of course you didn t 
no one ever means
for these things to happen 
but the king is dead   
and if it weren t for you   
he d still be alive 
your father had such hopes
for you   
gave you so many chances 
and this is how you repay him 
 sobbing  i didn t know 
i didn t know 
scar  oh  what will
your mother think 
a son who causes
his father s death 
a boy who kills a king 
what am i gonna do 
run 
run away  simba 
run away and never return 
  kill him 
   hyenas growling 
   hyena growls 
   simba gasps 
go down
and make sure he s dead 
seriously 
oh  i m sorry 
that s a good distance
right there 
okay 
kamari  no little cub
could survive that fall 
listen 
we re gonna tell her   
we went down there
and we ate him 
uh huh  that s perfect 
 cause i am starving 
we re not gonna eat him 
simba is dead 
that s all she ever
has to know 
works for me 
scar  mufasa s death
is a terrible tragedy 
the greatest leader
the pride has ever known 
to lose a brother   
such a deep  personal loss 
and little simba 
who had barely begun to live 
a cub whose blood
held our future 
it s almost too much
to endure 
i only wish i had gotten
to the gorge in time   
been there to save them 
and so it is
with a heavy heart   
that i must assume the throne 
mufasa and simba are gone   
which means i am your king 
but i must admit   
i cannot bear
this burden alone 
and i will need some help   
to ensure
  the safety of the pride 
   hyenas chattering 
nala  stay close 
and so  from the ashes
of this tragedy   
we shall welcome
the dawning of a new era 
a great   
and glorious future 
 hyenas chattering  laughing 
oh  dear 
 rafiki tutting 
 sighs 
 speaking xhosa 
 bird chirping 
 vultures screeching 
 yelling 
 grunts  i missed  em 
i m gonna get one of
those vultures one day 
i m gonna get one 
i don t know why it s
so important to you 
i just feel like it would
make me feel better 
 gasps  oh  no 
it s a little lion 
  that is not a lion 
  well then  go check it out 
  what is it 
  that is not a lion 
it s a furry bird 
it looks like a lion 
that s not a lion  let me get
a closer look  excuse me 
 sighs  all right  let me see
what we re dealing with here 
it s a lion 
  run for your life  pumbaa 
  wait  hey  timon 
wait  timon  wait 
 stammers  it s a little lion 
it gets bigger 
can we keep him 
can we please keep him 
oh  oh  okay  i promise
i ll walk him every day 
if he makes a little mess 
i ll clean it up 
you ll be his little mess 
he s gonna eat you and then
use my body as a toothpick 
but one day 
when he s big and strong 
he ll be on our side 
i ve got it 
what if he s on our side 
hear me out 
having a ferocious lion around
might not be such a bad idea 
well then  can we keep him 
yes  of course
we can keep him 
my god  who is the brains
of this operation 
 singing 
we re gonna name him fred 
who are you 
uh  we re the guys
who saved your life 
pumbaa  yes 
timon  risked everything 
fought off angry vultures 
hordes of them  flocks 
i m pumbaa 
  this is timon 
  did i mention
that we saved your life 
it doesn t matter 
whoa  how bleak is that 
  it doesn t even matter 
   timon sighs 
like i don t have enough
that i m dealing with  right 
now his problems
are my problems 
but we can help him  we re
in a position to help him 
 groans  so  how are you 
in as few words as possible 
i did something terrible 
i don t wanna talk about it 
look  kid 
we ve all made mistakes 
uh  there must be something
we can do  right 
not unless you can change
the past 
well  you know 
that s a lot to ask   
that s pretty hard 
that s a biggie 
timon    if i m being honest 
i mean  change the past 
it already happened 
yeah  so you can t
change that 
but you know
what you can change 
the future 
that s our specialty 
kind of our thing 
how can you change something
that hasn t happened 
well  to change the future 
you gotta put your past
behind you 
way behind 
look  kid  bad things happen
and you can t do anything
about it  right 
right 
wrong  when the world
turns its back on you   
you turn your back
on the world 
and only embrace what s next 
and turn the  what 
into  so what  
well  that s not
what i was taught

to challenge me 
we can finally take
whatever we want 
we 
long ago
you chose mufasa over me

so stop being so selfish 
you are the selfish one 
the other lions look to you 
as long as you resist
they will reject me 
take your place by my side 
and we will feast together 
i will never be your queen

i don t know where
you re getting  circle  from 
pumbaa  no  yeah

timon  no  it s no circle 
pumbaa  no  not at all 
  in fact  it s the opposite 
  pumbaa  yeah 
  it s a line 
  pumbaa  yeah 
it s a meaningless line
of indifference 
and we re all just running
towards the end of the line 
and then one day we ll reach
the end  and that ll be it 
  timon  that s it 
  line over 
timon  nothing 
pumbaa  nada 
and you can really
just kinda   
do your own thing
and fend for yourself   
 cause your line doesn t
affect anyone else s lines 
you re alive and then
you re not  like this guy 
mmm 
you sure it s not a circle 
that we re all connected 
a circle would mean
we re all this 
that would mean
what i do affects him   
affects that thing 
affects that thing 
timon  yeah  no 
that s not how it goes 
which would make
doing whatever we wanted
not that cool 
let me simplify this for you 
  life is meaningless 
  pumbaa  yes

look out for yourself 
that s why you do you  simba

 chorus singing
upbeat song in zulu 
 elephants trumpeting 
 chittering 
chorus   singing in english 
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
circle of life
 upbeat music playing 
man   singing  it s never
too late to turn things around
recover  unravel the path
to confound
the doubters and losers
that line up despair
who tell you it s over 
you re goin  nowhere
it s never too late  i hope
it s never too late
it s never too late
to get back on track
to get at least some 
if not all of it back
i thought i was happy 
and sometimes i was
but sadness is just
as important because
got to carry the weight
and hope
it s never too late
never too late
to fight the fight
never too late
to cheat the night
never too late to win the day
never too late to break away
time will start
to move too fast
but time is now 
my friend
i m a long way from the start
but further from the end
oh  no  it s never too late
it s never too late
to get up off the ground
don t have to be noticed 
don t have to be crowned
i did what i ve done 
and i don t try to hide
i ve lost many things 
but never my pride
it s never too late  i know
it s never too late
never too late
to fight the fight
never too late
to cheat the night
never too late to win the day
never too late to break away
time will start
to move too fast
but time is now 
my friend
i m a long way from the start
but further from the end
oh  no  it s never too late
never too late
i used to say
i don t have time
i m sleepin  tonight
a day doin  nothin 
is doin  it right
no hurry  no hurry 
it takes as long as it takes
you might as well sleep
for all the difference
it makes
i didn t find love
or peace on the breaks
these aren t excuses 
but a string of mistakes
i won t go back there
not going back there
never too late
to fight the fight
never too late
to cheat the night
never too late to win the day
never too late to break away
never too late
to fight the fight
never too late
to cheat the night
never too late to win the day
never too late to break away
time will start
to move too fast
but time is now  my friend
i m a long way from the start
but further from the end
oh  oh  it s never too late
it s never too late
