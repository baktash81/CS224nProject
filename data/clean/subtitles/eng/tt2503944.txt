a chance as a chef   
said to me it was god
who created oysters and apples 
and you can t improve recipes like that 
but it is our job to try 
 bell clangs 
   john lee hooker   it serves you right
to suffer  the avener rework   
being a young chef 
i sure as hell tried 
i spent ten years cooking in paris
and became head chef
of jean luc s restaurant 
i was good 
some nights i was almost
as good as i thought i was 
 to himself  999 696   
 men speaking indistinctly 
six ninety seven 
adam  at least that s what i m told 
six ninety eight   
six ninety nine 
then i destroyed it all 
my devils chased me out of paris
and i washed up in new orleans 
i sentenced myself
to hard labor shucking oysters 
 to himself  999 999 
adam 
and today s the last day of my penance 
one million 
 exhales 
man  you could give me a raise
and we d be good 
man  where the hell you goin

 train horn blaring 
 indistinct conversation

like the eyes of a dead clown 
he said he knows you from paris 
he called you  little tony  
 knocking on door 
it s your father s hotel 
you can let yourself in 
the boudin noir was cooked yesterday 
it was warmed up five hours
under a heat lamp 
a little crust had formed around it 
are you drunk or stoned 
or stoned or drunk or something else
no one apart from you has ever been 
you re serving seared tuna 
what happened to your
self respect  tony 
mm 
this from a guy who once stole methadone
from a dying sous chef 
you used to run the best
restaurant in paris 
yeah  and you destroyed it 
good  anger 
  hi  tony 
  you know  after you disappeared 
jean luc and i
had to close the restaurant 
there were rumors you had been
stabbed to death in amsterdam 
there were drug dealers 
and jean luc s daughter
claimed you made her pregnant 
and now i m back 
i m going after my third star 
if you try to start a new
restaurant in paris 
there are at least a dozen people
who will try to have you killed 
oh  no  no  not in paris 
here  in london 
i m gonna take over your restaurant 
 chuckles 
ah

if you want to live a long life 
eat your own tongue

licking yellow frogs  and women 
 laughs  three years without a word

he was a great chef 
hey  eat

sweeney  you just received one
of the best compliments i ve ever heard

adam has just said your cacio is one of
the best he s tasted outside of rome 
  what s your name again 
  helene 
next time you make cacio  toast
the pepper first to remove the moisture 
and then you want to

adam  oh  shit 
adam 
 both grunting 
 adam grunting  okay 
michel  okay 
okay 
 breathing heavily 
 laughs 
it s okay 
i had a long time to think about
what you did to me in paris 
when i was your sous chef
at jean luc s  we were like brothers 
so when i left  it s only
natural that you were    hurt 
so you took your revenge 
look  michel  i don t know
why i did that 
i know it was terrible  but   
what exactly did i do to you 
 speaking french 
you don t remember what you did to me 
no 
 speaking french 
you called the health inspector 
after releasing rats
into my new restaurant 
 speaking french 
oh  wow  that s terrible 
conti told me
you re going for the third star 
i need a job 
in paris  they say we are  old school  
 speaking french  that s bullshit 
 michel laughs 
 speaking french  okay  pal 
we re good 
mr  jones 
mr  jones  your credit card
has been denied 
there s no longer sufficient funds
available to cover the cost of your room 
that s okay 
i m friends with tony balerdi 
tony said to tell you that
your knives are in the bag 
 quietly  fuck 
 indistinct chatter 
   bonobo   flashlight  
yes  mate  what can i get you 
him 
you marinate the lamb in
za atar and lemon zest  right 
yeah  and yogurt  too  yeah 
  gorgeous 
  thank you 
look  mr  jones  i just want to say  i   
you ve always been a hero of mine 
we studied your menus and recipes   
  a hero or a god 
  i     chuckles 
i don t know the difference 
  would you work for me for nothing 
  for nothing 
  for food  for meals 
  yeah  absolutely 
  yeah  if i was learning loads  yeah 
  would you pay me 
 chuckles 
how much would you pay me
to work for me 
would you pay me
a hundred pounds a week 
  two hundred  three hundred 
   inhales  stammers 
i m trying to make a point 
your resume is great 
this lamb s fucking fantastic 
but you lack arrogance 
and to be in my kitchen 
you have to defend yourself 
okay 
no  you mean   fuck you  
 chuckling  yeah  yeah  fuck you 
 chuckles  okay 
now the most important question 
you have a spare bedroom 
 cookware and utensils
clanking in distance 
 quietly 
how long did you say he could stay 
do you think he s drunk 
david  he doesn t drink anymore 
are you sure he s famous 
if you re a chef  he s like   
the rolling stones 
oh 
  he scares me 
  he s a two star michelin chef 
 chuckling  he s supposed to be scary 
well  two doesn t seem like many 
to get even one michelin star 
you have to be like luke skywalker 
okay  to get two 
you have to be   
whoever alec guinness was 
but if you manage to get three   
 chuckles 
 cookware and utensils clank and rattle 
   you re yoda 
well  what if he s darth vader 
sara  i went crazy on summer vegetables
on a bed of ricotta for you 
and for your carnivore boyfriend 
tea smoked mackerel with duck egg 
and then we have bouillabaisse 
followed by escargot with garlic
and parsley butter 
 sara giggles 
what 
david says escargot is old fashioned 
keep eating 
   the avener   phoebe killdeer 
 fade out lines  the avener rework   
  helene  is this a joke 
  is what a joke 
you leaving me a note
to meet you at a burger king 
hmm  no joke 
no  this place is easy  accessible 
and cheap  it s easy to find 
they don t kick you out
if you talk to yourself 
which  for me  is crucial  sit down 
mmm  you want some lunch 
no  not here  no 
why not 
i prefer to eat food cooked
by a proper chef 
you don t like people on minimum wage 
 chuckling  mr  jones  i m a sous chef 
i m a person on minimum wage 
you know why people like you
don t like fast food 
sorry   people like me  
because it s food for the working class 
  excuse me 
  justify why it costs  500 more
to eat at a place where we work
than it does at a place like this 
  no 
   cause you can t 
because the food here
is made with too much fat
and too much salt and too many
cheap cuts of meat 
you just described most
classic french peasant dishes 
burger king is peasants
doing what peasants do 
giving a cheap cut
of meat a little style 
goulash  bourguignon  cassoulet 
shall i go on 
  i really have to go 
  what you should have said
is that the problem with this
place is it s too consistent 
and consistency is death 
consistency is what
every great chef strives for 
no  a chef should strive
to be consistent in experience 
but not consistent in taste 
it s like sex 
it s like  you re always headed
to the same place 
but you got to find new
and dangerous way of getting there 
i wish i could say it was
nice seeing you again  mr  jones 
but i m happy where i am  good luck 
adam jones  my god 
one hoped you were dead 
closed down any  uh 
good restaurants lately 
i don t close good restaurants 
my reviews close bad ones 
i need you to help me kick
this arrogant city s ass 
i m back  and i m gonna cook
like we did in the old days 
before we started warming up
fish in little plastic bags 
you know  when i lie awake at night
and list my regrets   
you re one of them 
i say to myself 
 simone  you re a lesbian 
why did you sleep with adam jones  
 chuckles 
  simone forth is here 
  sorry  who 
 who   the restaurant critic
of the fucking evening standard 
it s dry  the grouse is dry
and the sauce tastes like   
   cutlery clattering 
  everything is fucked 
we re finished 
she will destroy us 
 shouting in french 
you set this up 
your restaurant is fucked
unless you let me cook for her 
you are insane 
wait  wait 
wait 
service 
  the bastard could cook gravel 
   chuckles 
 sighs 
  i want to make amends for paris 
   tony chuckles 
so i hand my restaurant over to you 
and it s you doing me a favor 
if your father didn t own this place 
you would have been fired years ago 
michel will be my sous chef 
 speaking french  michel is in paris 
  max is in 
  max is in jail 
he s out in two days 
also i found a chef de partie
who doesn t know how good she is 
 she   ay 
 inhales  right there 
the whole thing falls apart 
because in three days
you will be fucking her 
in another three you will dump her  and
then she leaves with screams and tears 
no more women 
i ve been sober two years 
two weeks  and six days 
now  i want you to talk to your father 
  my father is sick 
  your father s not sick  he s dying 
i m giving you a chance
to finally make him proud of you 
  you are the best maitre d  in europe 
   clicks tongue 
my kitchen is going to be
the best in the world 
and we re gonna get the third star 
woman  the money the balerdi family has
agreed to pay to renovate the restaurant
is contingent upon you
showing up here every friday 
 doorbell buzzes 
i ll be taking samples of blood to test
for drugs and alcohol 
should a test prove positive 
the family will withdraw their financial
support for your restaurant immediately 
i ve been psychoanalyzing
tony balerdi for many years 
  do you attend meetings 
  no  i m not much for groups 
how do you to plan
to maintain your sobriety 
 in english accent 
oh  long walks in walden wood 
 normal accent  the power of prayer 
you have a disease 
there s no shame in seeking help 
i run a group here on tuesdays
and thursdays at 10 00 
you d be more than welcome to join 
you could make the sandwiches 
i don t make sandwiches 
well  i ve injected
so much junk in my life 
there may still be stockpiles
in my ankles 
 sighs 
in my experience  people who
come in here and make silly comments
are generally frightened
of what they might reveal
if they really took the time
to be themselves 
oh  i ve been myself since the  90s 
do you have a fear of needles 
well  that question indicates
a serious lack of research 
did you ever see that movie 
seven samurai 
that s how i want my chefs to be 
chef 
chef  i m afraid
there s been a complaint 
 low conversations 
do we have a problem 
 sighs 
please don t fight him
among all this bone china 
it ll be me who picks up the tab 
hello  reece 
a little bird told me
you d lost your touch  so   
a little lobster confirmed it 
leave us alone 
 sniffs 
so  not dead 
  apparently not 
  ah  looks can be deceiving 
i mean   dead  these days can
mean barbecuing chicken wings
with minor celebrities
on morning television 
 laughing  i ll never be that dead 
i love the decor  by the way 
  it s perfect for stoning infidels 
  what do you want 
i wanted to see how far the tortoise
had gotten ahead of me 
  you re the hare in this analogy 
  it s your analogy 
  what happened to butter 
  what happened to your angel face 
oh  crack cocaine and louisiana 
i heard an idiotic rumor
you re going for a third star 
i heard an idiotic rumor
that you d gotten yours 
  then i found out it s true 
  that must have hurt 
eh  i was on heavy painkillers
at the time 
okay  all right  look 
the whole mozart salieri bullshit
doesn t interest me anymore 
i cook good  local ingredients
in a unique  creative way
to impress my diners 
well  you don t cook 
you warm food up in condoms 
frying pans  flames and booze
went out with adam jones 
and please don t think
i m impressed with the water 
you re an addict 
so it s not alcohol now 
it ll be coke  or booze 
or fucking every girl you meet 
because you re addicted to the way
you feel every second of the day 
doomed youth is romantic 
doomed middle age really isn t 
please don t think that s on the house 
you pay your way like everyone else 
reece  in truth  the lobster was good 
if you have any humanity left 
leave tony balerdi and his father alone 
 loudly  but you fucked up the sauce
with too much lemon juice 
 conversations stop 
excuse me one second  was he drunk 
find out how far he s got and
who the fuck he s got with him 
 up tempo music playing 
got freed  you re out 
really  oh  fantastic 
 indistinct shouting 
  nice bike 
  michel s 
  does he know you borrowed it 
  not yet 
 laughter 
  how are you 
  good  good 
 inhales  assault 
he plated the monkfish upside down 
three times  upside fucking down  man 
   clicking tongue 
  come on 
he was a fat fucker 
and he was always chewing gum 
so you you took  you took matters
into your own hands 
yeah  yes  i did 
 speaking italian 
but they sewed his nose back on 
you know why  because it was
me who picked it up off the floor
and put it in a fish locker
until the ambulance arrived 
i mean  people conveniently
forget that part 
that s a shame 
 buzzer sounds 
 tools whirring 
adam  jody

it was better yesterday

come on 
mmm

  i didn t ask you 
you know  i m thinking the  uh

yeah  try this 
 hammering in distance 
 smacking lips  good 
 good    good  means nothing 
  i ve had a call from a tv show today 
  absolutely not 
you know  my analyst suggested you may
have an obsessive compulsive disorder
that you self medicated for years 
she thinks you should be
in a program or in a group 
i don t do groups  so what do you think 
is it too much or too little tarragon 
an e mail came addressed to you 
my french is rusty  but  uh 
i think technically it s a death threat 
do you remember the drug dealer
in paris  bonesis 
he says you owe him a lot of money 
  for what 
  wild guess  drugs 
everybody does tv these days 
tell me the truth about the tarragon 
it s a little heavy

 speaking french 
we were backing up  chef

  until you run your own kitchen 
  you say   yes  chef    
  everything was designed to shock 
    whatever you want  chef 
right away  chef  
  and then you shut the fuck up

you re a fucking poison  you know that

  so that was adam liking someone 
  i said i d get you back 
  and i ll double your salary 
  he already tripled it 
 chuckles  well    then it s times
three and then times two 
you can learn from him 
use him as a stepping stone
to get your own star 
his cooking style is out of date 
this isn t paris five years ago 
tastes have changed 
 laughs  the commis call
the frying pan drawer  the museum  
  did you know that 
  yeah 
 whispers  fuck 
 sizzling 
this is equipment 
and this is a chef 
it s a sous vide  or water bath 
it s used for poaching food
at fixed low temperatures 
  it s a condom 
  she has an idea 
  using condoms 
  we can finish the meat on the fire 
there s nothing wrong with that  but we
use this to seal in all the flavors 
vegetables  herbs  spices  marinades 
anything you want sealed in 
we adapt

is now one of the best
and most interesting places
in london to come and eat  
which part of that don t you like 
 one of  or  interesting  
i don t want my restaurant to be
a place where you come and eat 
i don t want my restaurant
to be a place where you fucking   
 helene laughs 
i mean  we should be dealing
in culinary orgasms 
 laughs 
when s the last time you had an orgasm
that was     interesting  
remind me never  ever
to discuss food with you in public 
adam  people eat because they re hungry 
i want to make food
that makes people stop eating 
you re being stupid 
cooking is an expression of who we are 
right now we re two stars 
both of us  it s a two star review 
now  we can keep on cooking
and be interesting 
but i want people to sit at that table
and be sick with longing 
and i need you in order to do that 
   sighs  good night  chef 
  good night  chef 
  morning  chef 
  morning  chef 
 ringing 
mmm 
 chuckles 
  morning  chef 
  morning  chef 
helene  quick  quick

she picks you up from school  okay 
sweetheart  please  come on 
lily  we re late 
lil  please  come on 
one  two  three 
have a look at the new menu 
a few items will seem familiar 
most are new 
and most of our guests will be
a bit uncomfortable at first 
do you know about the michelin men 
  it is a book 
  it is the book  yana  the bible 
tony  michelin sends its inspectors
to restaurants to eat and award stars 
  one  two  three 
  or none 
no one knows who they are  no one 
they come  they eat  they go 
but they have habits 
they have to stick to a routine
to give every restaurant
the same chance 
michelin men eat in pairs 
kaitlin  sometimes the michelin man
could even be a woman 
they always book a table before 7 30 
the first of the pair arrives early
and has a drink at the bar 
his partner arrives half an hour later 
one orders the tasting menu 
the other one a la carte  always 
they order half a bottle of wine 
they ask for tap water 
they wear business suits 
they re polite  but attention 
they may place a fork on the floor 
under the table to see if you notice 
and they wouldn t drop it
because that could make
a noise and make it too easy 
adam  everything from now on
must be perfect 
not good  not excellent    perfect 
if they find one single thing wrong 
they will kill us 
and they will come for us soon 
  how long on the lamb 
  max  give me two more minutes  chef 
adam   clears throat 
there are two men at the kitchen door
wanting to see you 
they re french 
service

  michel  to the pass 
  yes  chef 
 low conversation 
 indistinct chatter 
 michel speaking french  bonesis 
 tony speaking french  adam still

ratte potato and truffle 
and i used a little bit
of your beef sauce 
that s good 
it s my daughter lily s
birthday on thursday 
conti used to let me have the day off
so that i could throw her a party 
i was hoping i could maybe miss
the lunch service on thursday 
the problem with being good
is you become indispensable 
i need you here all day thursday 
yes  chef 
 door creaks open 
  max  truffles 
  got them 
  helene  david 
  yes  chef 
  fish 
  yes  chef 
chef

helene  one mackerel 
one scallop  two veal  where s my fish 
  coming 
  david 
  yes  chef 
  hurry up 
when are you gonna do something
about medusa out there 
you re pushing her too hard 
if you re not careful 
she s gonna end up like you 
and we can t have a kitchen
with two of you in it 
it s the end of service 
she should be fine 
if not  we need to know that 
she wants to be like us 
in order to do that 
she s got to live the life 
i liked her better before 
just wanted to tell you 
i had dinner with tony last night 
he wasted his night off with you  huh 
 chuckles  we talked a lot about you 
isn t there a rule that analysts have about
discussing patients with other patients 
i m not your analyst 
  thank god 
   chuckles 
you know he s in love
with you  don t you 
yes 
he didn t relaunch the restaurant
to impress his father 
  he did it for you 
  yeah 
he wants you to get your third star 
even after all the pain
you ve caused him 
he wants to see what you d be like
without a knife in your hand 
fighting for your life 
you know  people pay prostitutes extra
to fake orgasms 
maybe tony pays you extra
to fake concern 
tell me what frightens you 
spiders  death 
 chuckles  well  or maybe
the imperfection of human relationships 
the imperfection of others 
  of yourself 
   sighs 
what happens if you get this third star 
  oh  no  not  if    when  
  all right  when you get it 
celebration  fireworks 
sainthood  immortality 
perfection 
mm hm  sure 
what happens if you fail 
plague  pestilence 
seas rise  locusts devour 
the four horsemen ride
and darkness descends 
death 
  sure 
  okay  this is for free 
someone told you when you
were very small that you were good
and the world was good 
and everything naturally would be good 
and then the serpent
served you a bad apple 
and for all your bullshit 
you can t take bad 
not in a souffle  not in an apple 
and crucially  not in a person 
should i be writing this down 
 cause i don t have a crayon 
whatever it was
or whoever it was in the past 
it s time to get on with it 
and you can t do this alone 
there s strength in needing others   
not weakness 
make sure to thank tony
for those kind thoughts  doc 
oh  that wasn t tony  that was all me 
food s up  guys  family meal 
 indistinct chatter 
 chattering continues

it could have done 
we were really good
for a long time  but   
you know  we drank too much

then i got pregnant with lily and 
you know  i wanted to stop 
and he didn t 
  didn t or couldn t 
  what s the difference

i worked in places like this
all the time when i was a kid

and  uh  michel came later 
i didn t speak any french

the heat  the pressure  the violence 
the fucking screaming 
you know  all the cooks 
that kitchen is the only place
i ve ever felt like i really belonged 
why 
what happened in paris 
i just fucked it all up 
maybe it s   
maybe i just wanted it really bad 
and then when i got it too early 
i didn t know how to hold on to it 
i tried to control everything 
then when i wanted to escape from it   
five o clock s always the worst time
for thinking things 
i always think of things
