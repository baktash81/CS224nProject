a chance as a chef
said to me it was god
who created oysters and apples
and you cant improve recipes like that
but it is our job to try
bell clangs
john lee hooker it serves you right
to suffer the avener rework
being a young chef
i sure as hell tried
i spent ten years cooking in paris
and became head chef
of jean lucs restaurant
i was good
some nights i was almost
as good as i thought i was
to himself 999696
men speaking indistinctly
six ninetyseven
adam at least thats what im told

one million
exhales

restaurant in paris

jean luc and i
had to close the restaurant
there were rumors you had been
stabbed to death in amsterdam
there were drug dealers
and jean lucs daughter
claimed you made her pregnant

if you try to start a new
restaurant in paris
there are at least a dozen people
who will try to have you killed

sweeney you just received one
of the best compliments ive ever heard
this is adam
kinda notorious back in the day
adam has just said your cacio is one of
the best hes tasted outside of rome

helene
next time you make cacio toast
the pepper first to remove the moisture
and then you want to
grind it by hand yeah

breathing heavily
laughs
its okay
i had a long time to think about
what you did to me in paris
when i was your sous chef
at jean lucs we were like brothers
so when i left its only
natural that you were hurt
so you took your revenge
look michel i dont know
why i did that
i know it was terrible but
what exactly did i do to you
speaking french
you dont remember what you did to me
no
speaking french
you called the health inspector
after releasing rats
into my new restaurant
speaking french
oh wow thats terrible
conti told me
youre going for the third star
i need a job
in paris they say we are old school
speaking french thats bullshit
michel laughs
speaking french okay pal
were good
mr jones
mr jones your credit card
has been denied
theres no longer sufficient funds
available to cover the cost of your room
thats okay
im friends with tony balerdi
tony said to tell you that
your knives are in the bag
quietly fuck
indistinct chatter
bonobo flashlight
yes mate what can i get you
him
you marinate the lamb in
zaatar and lemon zest right
yeah and yogurt too yeah
gorgeous
thank you
look mr jones i just want to say i
youve always been a hero of mine
we studied your menus and recipes
a hero or a god
i chuckles
i dont know the difference
would you work for me for nothing
for nothing
for food for meals
yeah absolutely
yeah if i was learning loads yeah
would you pay me
chuckles
how much would you pay me
to work for me
would you pay me
a hundred pounds a week
two hundred three hundred
inhales stammers
im trying to make a point
your resume is great
this lambs fucking fantastic
but you lack arrogance
and to be in my kitchen
you have to defend yourself
okay
no you mean fuck you
chuckling yeah yeah fuck you
chuckles okay
now the most important question
you have a spare bedroom
cookware and utensils
clanking in distance
quietly
how long did you say he could stay
do you think hes drunk
david he doesnt drink anymore
are you sure hes famous
if youre a chef hes like
the rolling stones
oh
he scares me
hes a twostar michelin chef
chuckling hes supposed to be scary
well two doesnt seem like many
to get even one michelin star
you have to be like luke skywalker
okay to get two
you have to be
whoever alec guinness was
but if you manage to get three
chuckles
cookware and utensils clank and rattle
youre yoda
well what if hes darth vader
sara i went crazy on summer vegetables
on a bed of ricotta for you
and for your carnivore boyfriend
teasmoked mackerel with duck egg
and then we have bouillabaisse
followed by escargot with garlic
and parsley butter
sara giggles
what
david says escargot is oldfashioned
keep eating
the avener  phoebe killdeer
fade out lines the avener rework
helene is this a joke
is what a joke
you leaving me a note
to meet you at a burger king
hmm no joke
no this place is easy accessible
and cheap its easy to find
they dont kick you out
if you talk to yourself
which for me is crucial sit down
mmm you want some lunch
no not here no
why not
i prefer to eat food cooked
by a proper chef
you dont like people on minimum wage
chuckling mr jones im a sous chef
im a person on minimum wage
you know why people like you
dont like fast food
sorry people like me
because its food for the working class
excuse me
justify why it costs 500 more
to eat at a place where we work
than it does at a place like this
no
cause you cant
because the food here
is made with too much fat
and too much salt and too many
cheap cuts of meat
you just described most
classic french peasant dishes
burger king is peasants
doing what peasants do
giving a cheap cut
of meat a little style
goulash bourguignon cassoulet
shall i go on
i really have to go
what you should have said
is that the problem with this
place is its too consistent
and consistency is death
consistency is what
every great chef strives for
no a chef should strive
to be consistent in experience
but not consistent in taste
its like sex
its like youre always headed
to the same place
but you got to find new
and dangerous way of getting there
i wish i could say it was
nice seeing you again mr jones
but im happy where i am good luck
adam jones my god
one hoped you were dead
closed down any uh
good restaurants lately
i dont close good restaurants
my reviews close bad ones
i need you to help me kick
this arrogant citys ass
im back and im gonna cook
like we did in the old days
before we started warming up
fish in little plastic bags
you know when i lie awake at night
and list my regrets
youre one of them
i say to myself
simone youre a lesbian
why did you sleep with adam jones
chuckles
simone forth is here
sorry who
who the restaurant critic
of the fucking evening standard
its dry the grouse is dry
and the sauce tastes like
cutlery clattering
everything is fucked
were finished
she will destroy us
shouting in french
you set this up
your restaurant is fucked
unless you let me cook for her
you are insane
wait wait
wait
service
the bastard could cook gravel
chuckles
sighs
i want to make amends for paris
tony chuckles
so i hand my restaurant over to you
and its you doing me a favor
if your father didnt own this place
you would have been fired years ago
michel will be my sous chef
speaking french michel is in paris
max is in
max is in jail
hes out in two days
also i found a chef de partie
who doesnt know how good she is
she ay
inhales right there
the whole thing falls apart
because in three days
you will be fucking her
in another three you will dump her and
then she leaves with screams and tears
no more women
ive been sober two years
two weeks and six days
now i want you to talk to your father
my father is sick
your fathers not sick hes dying
im giving you a chance
to finally make him proud of you
you are the best maitre d in europe
clicks tongue
my kitchen is going to be
the best in the world
and were gonna get the third star
woman the money the balerdi family has
agreed to pay to renovate the restaurant
is contingent upon you
showing up here every friday
doorbell buzzes
ill be taking samples of blood to test
for drugs and alcohol
should a test prove positive
the family will withdraw their financial
support for your restaurant immediately
ive been psychoanalyzing
tony balerdi for many years
do you attend meetings
no im not much for groups
how do you to plan
to maintain your sobriety
in english accent
oh long walks in walden wood
normal accent the power of prayer
you have a disease
theres no shame in seeking help
i run a group here on tuesdays
and thursdays at 1000
youd be more than welcome to join
you could make the sandwiches
i dont make sandwiches
well ive injected
so much junk in my life
there may still be stockpiles
in my ankles
sighs
in my experience people who
come in here and make silly comments
are generally frightened
of what they might reveal
if they really took the time
to be themselves
oh ive been myself since the 90s
do you have a fear of needles
well that question indicates
a serious lack of research
did you ever see that movie
seven samurai
thats how i want my chefs to be
chef
chef im afraid
theres been a complaint
low conversations
do we have a problem
sighs
please dont fight him
among all this bone china
itll be me who picks up the tab
hello reece
a little bird told me
youd lost your touch so
a little lobster confirmed it
leave us alone
sniffs
so not dead
apparently not
ah looks can be deceiving
i mean dead these days can
mean barbecuing chicken wings
with minor celebrities
on morning television
laughing ill never be that dead
i love the decor by the way
its perfect for stoning infidels
what do you want
i wanted to see how far the tortoise
had gotten ahead of me
youre the hare in this analogy
its your analogy
what happened to butter
what happened to your angel face
oh crack cocaine and louisiana
i heard an idiotic rumor
youre going for a third star
i heard an idiotic rumor
that youd gotten yours
then i found out its true
that must have hurt
eh i was on heavy painkillers
at the time
okay all right look
the whole mozartsalieri bullshit
doesnt interest me anymore
i cook good local ingredients
in a unique creative way
to impress my diners
well you dont cook
you warm food up in condoms
frying pans flames and booze
went out with adam jones
and please dont think
im impressed with the water
youre an addict
so its not alcohol now
itll be coke or booze
or fucking every girl you meet
because youre addicted to the way
you feel every second of the day
doomed youth is romantic
doomed middle age really isnt
please dont think thats on the house
you pay your way like everyone else
reece in truth the lobster was good
if you have any humanity left
leave tony balerdi and his father alone
loudly but you fucked up the sauce
with too much lemon juice
conversations stop
excuse me one second was he drunk
find out how far hes got and
who the fuck hes got with him
uptempo music playing
got freed youre out
really oh fantastic
indistinct shouting

she thinks you should be

i dont do groups so what do you think

an email came addressed to you
my french is rusty but uh
i think technically its a death threat
do you remember the drug dealer
in paris bonesis
he says you owe him a lot of money
for what
wild guess drugs
everybody does tv these days

adam jones at the langham

helene laughs

laughs
whens the last time you had an orgasm
that was interesting
remind me never ever
to discuss food with you in public
adam people eat because theyre hungry
i want to make food

youre being stupid
cooking is an expression of who we are
right now were two stars
both of us its a twostar review

sweetheart please come on
lily were late
lil please come on
one two three
have a look at the new menu
a few items will seem familiar
most are new
and most of our guests will be
a bit uncomfortable at first
do you know about the michelin men
it is a book
it is the book yana the bible
tony michelin sends its inspectors
to restaurants to eat and award stars
one two three
or none
no one knows who they are no one
they come they eat they go
but they have habits
they have to stick to a routine
to give every restaurant
the same chance
michelin men eat in pairs
kaitlin sometimes the michelin man
could even be a woman
they always book a table before 730
the first of the pair arrives early
and has a drink at the bar
his partner arrives half an hour later
one orders the tasting menu
the other one a la carte always
they order half a bottle of wine
they ask for tap water
they wear business suits
theyre polite but attention
they may place a fork on the floor
under the table to see if you notice
and they wouldnt drop it
because that could make
a noise and make it too easy
adam everything from now on
must be perfect
not good not excellent perfect
if they find one single thing wrong
they will kill us
and they will come for us soon
how long on the lamb
max give me two more minutes chef
adam clears throat
there are two men at the kitchen door
wanting to see you
theyre french
service

ratte potato and truffle
and i used a little bit
of your beef sauce
thats good
its my daughter lilys

conti used to let me have the day off

door creaks open

david
yes chef
hurry up
when are you gonna do something
about medusa out there
youre pushing her too hard
if youre not careful
shes gonna end up like you
and we cant have a kitchen
with two of you in it
its the end of service
she should be fine
if not we need to know that
she wants to be like us
in order to do that
shes got to live the life
i liked her better before
just wanted to tell you
i had dinner with tony last night
he wasted his night off with you huh
chuckles we talked a lot about you
isnt there a rule that analysts have about
discussing patients with other patients
im not your analyst
thank god
chuckles
you know hes in love
with you dont you
yes
he didnt relaunch the restaurant
to impress his father
he did it for you
yeah
he wants you to get your third star
even after all the pain
youve caused him
he wants to see what youd be like
without a knife in your hand
fighting for your life
you know people pay prostitutes extra
to fake orgasms
maybe tony pays you extra
to fake concern
tell me what frightens you
spiders death
chuckles well or maybe
the imperfection of human relationships
the imperfection of others
of yourself
sighs
what happens if you get this third star
oh no not if when
all right when you get it
celebration fireworks
sainthood immortality
perfection
mmhm sure
what happens if you fail
plague pestilence
seas rise locusts devour
the four horsemen ride
and darkness descends
death
sure
okay this is for free
someone told you when you
were very small that you were good
and the world was good
and everything naturally would be good
and then the serpent
served you a bad apple
and for all your bullshit
you cant take bad
not in a souffle not in an apple
and crucially not in a person
should i be writing this down
cause i dont have a crayon
whatever it was
or whoever it was in the past
its time to get on with it
and you cant do this alone
theres strength in needing others
not weakness
make sure to thank tony
for those kind thoughts doc
oh that wasnt tony that was all me
foods up guys family meal
indistinct chatter
chattering continues

leon sweeney
didnt work out huh
it could have done
we were really good
for a long time but

then i got pregnant with lily and
you know i wanted to stop
and he didnt
didnt or couldnt
whats the difference
yeah
i worked in places like this
all the time when i was a kid
i saved up a bunch of money
bought a oneway ticket to paris
lied my way into jean lucs kitchen
thats when max was there and reece
and uh michel came later
i didnt speak any french
worked 20hour days six days a week
i was 19 years old
i loved every minute of it
the heat the pressure the violence
the fucking screaming
you know all the cooks
that kitchen is the only place
ive ever felt like i really belonged
why
what happened in paris
i just fucked it all up
maybe its
maybe i just wanted it really bad
and then when i got it too early
i didnt know how to hold on to it
i tried to control everything
then when i wanted to escape from it
five oclocks always the worst time
for thinking things
i always think of things
like i make a list of like
things and people
i always think about right now
its like my mom
my grandmother jean luc
its like a broken fucking record
