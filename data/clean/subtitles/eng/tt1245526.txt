so when it came to light 
my loyalty was questioned 
and i was ordered to kill him 
it was a test 
what did you do 
put three bullets
in his chest 
okay 
who the hell are you guys 
you don t remember us 
we remember you 
you re the guy who s shit we cleaned up
down in guatemala 1981 
and the question is   
who did you fly out of there 
y  you don t have any idea what
you re getting into 
first of all 
you can t touch me 
sure we can 
oh yeah

now you got something to say 
we extracted a young lieutenant 
who was the son of the late senator 
james stanton 
robert stanton 
vice president of the united states 
you re saying the vice president
killed all the people in that village 
yeah  went completely off
the reservation 
and that new york times reporter 
did she pressure you 
yeah  yeah  she called me  twice 
so i called the vp 
and  what did you think would
happen then 
oh  whatever    
i made him vice president 
and kept your mouth shut  and
the stantons made you rich 
we have been working with our partners
in the developing road to root out corruption 
  ruption     ruption 
okay 
i will pay whatever it costs
to get rid of this thing 
we re not here for money  homes 
we re here because that new york times
reporter had the list of names 
of everybody who was in guatemala 
and everybody on that list 
has been ordered killed 
except you 
i had nothing to do with that 
don t you see 
he s trying to clean up his past and 
get rid of me in one shot 
he s trying to cut me loose before he
runs for president 
we have some major activity out here 
looks like we re blown 
we re in position 
perimeters set 
no ones getting away 
they re moving a team up the
east side 
are you going to let me talk to them 
i can negotiate something 
thanks  but when we want your help 
we ll bring out the drain cleaner 
listen  plastic man 
those bastards probable have orders
to kill me  too 
i hope so 
why   cause i m a bad guy 
i m scum 
can i just shoot him now 
no  you don t have people killed 
i have people killed  i m
the bad guy   remember 
not worth the bullet 
hello 
  how s retirement  frank 
  it s been a real blast 
if we have to come in there and get you 
it s going to be messy 
you bet  real messy 
  i ve got my orders  frank 
  they come from the vice president 
he s ordered these hits to cover up
the war crimes he commited  
  in guatemala 
well i find that hard to believe 
how did you know you d find me here 
some anonymous untraceable tip 
here s the deal  frank 
you re gonna walk out that front door
and give yourself up 
you have my word no one
will shoot you 
i will personally take you in and you
get to tell your side of the story 
you got 60 seconds
to decide 
  what s it look like 
  there s no clean exit 
they seem to be coming from everywhere 
we re running out of options 
if we have a distraction  i could cover
you to the woods 
looks like there s not a lot
of options  kid 
somebody s going to have to make
the hard choice 
if we re going to get out
of here alive 
and well 
hard and crazy 
but i wouldn t want it any other way 
an honor 
good luck 
tell them to hold their fire 
i m coming out 
he s coming out 
all units hold fire  repeat 
all units hold fire 
get behind 
come out now  i ve got you covered 
who fired the shot 
tell me when the boys make cover 
we ll move 
now 
they got sarah 
frank  you re no good to her dead 
we gotta move 
come  now is not time to waste 
ivan 
zaychick moy 
it s nice to see you again  ivan 
did he just call you  bunny  
life sometimes is complicated 
quickly 
to joe 
to joe 
not to push the bounds of propriety but 
don t you think 
we aught to discuss the fact that the cia s
being used
by the vice president as his
personal hit squad and
that they ll do whatever they can
to find us and kill us 
options 
we could go public 
that didn t work very
well for the reporter 
and what about frank s girlfriend 
they ll kill her so fast  i mean    
first they ll interrogate her they probably
already got the wires then    
give her a little snorkle  give her a jump 
  bring in the death    
  marvin 
god  you re such an idiot 
i want to show you something 
that was done to me by the
love of my life 
it seems that what we had 
was not meant to be 
but now  she sits outside my house    
    drinking vodka 
three bullets in the chest 
when i woke alive
i knew she still loved me 
or else  it would have been
the head 
it was big risk for her  of course but    
one does crazy things for love 
do not fear for your love  my friend 
with a small  dedicated group 
there is nothing that cannot be accomplished 
let me be blunt 
no one knows you re here 
you don t exist 
and unless you don t cooperate fully 
there s nothing i can t do to you 
so why don t you and i start talking 
  sir 
  not now 
moses is on the phone 
the trace is running 
moses 
here s the thing  cooper 
with age 
comes a certain  perspective 
i d be a lier if i said there wasn t a time 
when i was exactly like you 
blind ambition 
displaced trust    
why are  you telling me this 
it might help me to decide what
to do next 
keep him going 
well  what are you thinking about 
our buisness is very harmful 
but it was never  the killing  the stress    
    the bad pay didn t bother me 
well  what was it  frank 
it s that anything that you love  can
be taken away from you 
they tell you to never care  never invest   
then i met this woman    
sarah 
and now  you have her 
i can t think of anything
more horrible than to know that your
enemies can hurt someone that you love 
the feeling is almost undescribable 
you still there  cooper 
you re in my house 
almost indescribable  isn t it 
please    
please don t hurt my family 
if anything happens to sarah  i will
rip everything you love out of your life 
and then i ll kill you 
i ll do whatever you want to keep sarah safe 
we don t have much time 
do you understand that 
what are you going to do  frank 
i m going to kill the
vice president 
what are you going to do 
ma 
frank left this for me 
where did he get it from 
the secure records depository of the cia 
look  sarah    
i know franks  been right about
a few things 
but he s about to cross the line
from which there is no turning back 
right now  you have an opportunity
to help him 
you need to tell me
everything you know 
because if i can t stop him 
i m going to have to kill him 
do  you know who frank moses is 
i mean  really is 
do you know what he s done 
wow 
you re asking me for help 
that is so lame 
he s going to eat you for lunch 
she s never going to trust us 
i can t blame her 
the tip off is a trap  someones got us
dancing like marionettes 
just like moses called it 
yeah 
he will take a shot at the vp 
that s the problem for the secret service 
moses would take them apart 
plug me into their detail 
you got it 
what about her 
i d keep her close  protected  off the grid 
i put a few things away 
just in case  you know 
frank
