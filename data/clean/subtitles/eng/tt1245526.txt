by the united nations
for every problem monsieur there is
a solution
excuse me
buisness and it makes us
what
how many ceos can say that
so how did you guys meet
we started talking on the phone
i guess i liked that it
wasnt real
course now im a fugitive the cia wants to kill me
and im hiding in a hole
you know i was in love with
an agent once
what happened
well i was with mi6
and the relationship
wasntsanctioned
so when it came to light
my loyalty was questioned
and i was ordered to kill him
it was a test
what did you do
put three bullets
in his chest
okay
who the hell are you guys
you dont remember us
we remember you
youre the guy whos shit we cleaned up
down in guatemala 1981
and the question is
who did you fly out of there

youre getting into
first of all
you cant touch me
sure we can
oh yeah
whered you get this
home depot
how much
ten bucks

now you got something to say
we extracted a young lieutenant
who was the son of the late senator
james stanton
robert stanton
vice president of the united states
youre saying the vice president
killed all the people in that village
yeah went completely off
the reservation
and that new york times reporter
did she pressure you
yeah yeah she called me twice
so i called the vp
and what did you think would
happen then
oh whatever
i made him vice president
and kept your mouth shut and
the stantons made you rich
we have been working with our partners
in the developing road to root out corruption
ruption ruption
okay
i will pay whatever it costs
to get rid of this thing
were not here for money homes
were here because that new york times
reporter had the list of names
of everybody who was in guatemala
and everybody on that list
has been ordered killed
except you
i had nothing to do with that
dont you see
hes trying to clean up his past and
get rid of me in one shot
hes trying to cut me loose before he
runs for president
we have some major activity out here
looks like were blown
were in position
perimeters set
no ones getting away
theyre moving a team up the
east side
are you going to let me talk to them
i can negotiate something
thanks but when we want your help
well bring out the drain cleaner
listen plastic man
those bastards probable have orders
to kill me too
i hope so
why cause im a bad guy
im scum
can i just shoot him now
no you dont have people killed
i have people killed im
the bad guyremember
not worth the bullet
hello
hows retirement frank
its been a real blast
if we have to come in there and get you
its going to be messy
you bet real messy
ive got my orders frank
they come from the vice president
hes ordered these hits to cover up
the war crimes he commited
in guatemala
well i find that hard to believe
how did you know youd find me here
some anonymous untraceable tip
heres the deal frank
youre gonna walk out that front door
and give yourself up
you have my word no one
will shoot you
i will personally take you in and you
get to tell your side of the story
you got 60 seconds
to decide
whats it look like
theres no clean exit
they seem to be coming from everywhere
were running out of options
if we have a distraction i could cover
you to the woods
looks like theres not a lot
of options kid
somebodys going to have to make
the hard choice
if were going to get out
of here alive
and well
hard and crazy
but i wouldnt want it any other way
an honor
good luck
tell them to hold their fire
im coming out
hes coming out
all units hold fire repeat
all units hold fire
get behind
come out now ive got you covered
who fired the shot
tell me when the boys make cover
well move
now
they got sarah
frank youre no good to her dead
we gotta move
come now is not time to waste
ivan
zaychick moy
its nice to see you again ivan
did he just call you bunny
life sometimes is complicated
quickly
to joe
to joe
not to push the bounds of propriety but
dont you think
we aught to discuss the fact that the cias
being used
by the vice president as his
personal hit squad and
that theyll do whatever they can
to find us and kill us
options
we could go public
that didnt work very
well for the reporter
and what about franks girlfriend
theyll kill her so fast i mean
first theyll interrogate her they probably
already got the wires then
give her a little snorkle give her a jump
bring in the death
marvin
god youre such an idiot
i want to show you something
that was done to me by the
love of my life
it seems that what we had
was not meant to be
but now she sits outside my house
drinking vodka
three bullets in the chest
when i woke alive
i knew she still loved me
or else it would have been
the head
it was big risk for her of course but
one does crazy things for love
do not fear for your love my friend
with a small dedicated group
there is nothing that cannot be accomplished
let me be blunt
no one knows youre here
you dont exist
and unless you dont cooperate fully
theres nothing i cant do to you
so why dont you and i start talking
sir
not now
moses is on the phone
the trace is running
moses
heres the thing cooper
with age
comes a certain perspective
id be a lier if i said there wasnt a time
when i was exactly like you
blind ambition
displaced trust
why are  you telling me this
it might help me to decide what
to do next
keep him going
well what are you thinking about
our buisness is very harmful
but it was never the killing the stress
the bad pay didnt bother me
well what was it frank
its that anything that you love can
be taken away from you
they tell you to never care never invest
then i met this woman
sarah
and now you have her
i cant think of anything
more horrible than to know that your
enemies can hurt someone that you love
the feeling is almost undescribable
you still there cooper
youre in my house
almost indescribable isnt it
please
please dont hurt my family
if anything happens to sarah i will
rip everything you love out of your life
and then ill kill you
ill do whatever you want to keep sarah safe
we dont have much time
do you understand that
what are you going to do frank
im going to kill the
vice president
what are you going to do
ma
frank left this for me
where did he get it from
