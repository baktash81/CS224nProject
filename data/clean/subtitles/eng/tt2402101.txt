don t you ever forget that 
libby 
what you re about to tell us
is very  very important 
did ben kill your mom
and your sisters 
you were in the house
when it happened 
so tell us  it was ben 
he killed them  right 
i have a meanness inside me 
real as an organ 
it s the day blood 
something s fuckin 
wrong with it 
i was eight the night they were
killed and suddenly i was famous 
the little orphan girl of the
kansas prairie massacre 
so  strangers send me money 
just enough for
me to do nothing 
which was exactly what i did 
how much is left 
do you read
the reports i send you 
sometimes 
have you at least
listened to my messages 
how much 
there is  482 and 12 cents
left in your fund 
now as i have
mentioned before   
jesus   
   had you been
able to replenish it
with any kind of
regular income 
we d have been
able to keep it afloat 
you re also two months
behind on your rent 
what about the book  hmm 
that should have
made more money 
  i know 
  any new donations 
thirtieth anniversary
is coming up   
  you know  i could   
  people have short attention spans  libby 
and there s always
a new murder  i m afraid 
they want to help
other little girls 
and the truth is  you re not
a little girl anymore 
i m not ready for this 
but in a way 
it could turn out to be
a blessing in disguise 
and lead you into an exciting
new phase of your life 
what do you want to be
when you grow up 
are you fucking kidding me 
in the past jim jeffries used to
hand me bulging shoe boxes full of mail 
most of them letters
with checks inside 
in return 
donors would receive
a form letter in my blocky
handwriting that read   
 thank you for your donation 
 it s people like you who let me
look forward to a brighter future

chopped to bits in england back in 1867

he was playing the role of her murderer 
frederick baker 
jesus christ   
you guys need to get a life

push the role players out 
but  too many guys
are into that 
plus  it s a good
source of income for us 
  us 
  the solvers 
we re a serious minded
organization 
among our ranks
are ex cops 
private and insurance
investigators  lawyers 
we solve crimes 
it s what we do 
lyle  who s your young friend

off me  you freak 
  i m kidding  i m sorry

been the weirdest 
you know what  i m outta here 
no  no  no  libby  please 
i don t want to
do this anymore 
no  no 
i can understand why
you wouldn t like it so far 
okay 
but we re not all like that 
look  just give me a chance 
look at this in here 
it s a bunch of pi s who think
they ve identified a serial killer 
they re about to
catch some guy
who has been crossing states 
you know  missouri  kansas 
oklahoma  to help kill people 
what do you mean  help 
they call him
the angel of debt 
they think he s like
a jack kevorkian
for people with bad credit 
good life insurance
and no way out 
you ll like our group 
it s serious  no costumes 
hi everyone  it s my honor
to present our special guest 
and the star
of this year s kill club 
libby day 
around 2 00 a m 
on october the 13th  1985 
a person or persons killed
three members of the day family
in their farm house
in kinnakee  kansas 
the youngest child  libby 
escaped the killer through
a window in her mother s room 
the oldest child  benjamin 
never produced an alibi
and was extremely
uncooperative with the police 
libby testified 
she saw ben
commit the murders 
despite libby s
confused testimony 
and young age 
and despite a startling lack
of physical evidence 
ben day was convicted 
based largely on rumors that
he was involved in devil worship 
you done 
i think the general
consensus is that runner day 
her father  did it 
i mean  he goes to patty 
tries to bully her for money 
as usual gets nothing 
and he goes haywire 
i mean  the guy
was crazy  right 
right  i don t know   
look  i didn t know him 
he left when i was  like  two 
  where is he now 
  i don t know 
there was a blood stain
on michelle s bed sheets 
different blood type
than anyone in the family 
but since the sheets
were from goodwill 
prosecutor says that blood
could have come from anywhere 
yeah  we were poor 
a lot of our shit
came from goodwill  okay 
do you remember anything
out of the ordinary
  happening that day 
  like what 
like  how your mother reacted
to the krissi cates scandal 
  who 
  krissi cates 
i don t know who that is 
you mentioned
her in your book 
i didn t write that book 
i didn t even read it 
what about trey teepano 
what about ben day 
you want to hear
what i have to say about him 
please  this is the grossest
miscarriage of justice ever 
what is this woman s deal 
magda here is very involved in
the effort to free your brother 
he s a wonderful man 
he draws  he writes poetry 
you should get to know him  libby 
you really should 
in three weeks 
that window is going to close 
what 
in order to solve this crime 
we need to compile
new evidence and
if you were inclined 
you could recant your testimony
when we file for habeas corpus 
but time is of the essence 
what are you talking about 
oh  because of budget cuts 
they are consolidating departments
and disposing of evidence
from cases
older than 10 years 
which means 
in three weeks  time 
ben s file will be shredded 
you re just a few people
who like murder
mysteries and true crimes   
libby  ben is innocent
and we re trying to prove it 
he s never even
filed for an appeal 
he s had reason enough for
eight appeals but he has lost hope 
good 
  please help   
  no 
  it s not a conspiracy theory   
  hey  don t be like that 
get your hands off me 
at least stay and
try and convince us 
i told you she wouldn t
bother  lazy little liar 
yes  that s what you are and
what you ve always been 
a liar 
you don t know shit about
what happened that night 
none of you 
run  run 
no 
libby  libby 
libby

 once i was in art class
and met a boy named ben 
 it was his heart
i knew i would win

two different things 
so  like  his drunken granddad
raped a chinese whore 
you better watch your mouth 
trey s into
some scary ass shit 
satanic shit 
yeah  we get into some
pretty dark shit sometimes 
you re one of the guys
that killed the cows 
we have to 
it s an order 
bro  that s a weird order 
that was my hamburger 
look at his face 
sometimes things have to die 
we have to kill them 
just like jesus requires
sacrifice  so does satan 
mom  is ben in trouble

where are your people
from originally  ireland 
germany 
my maiden name was krause 
there was another
german farmer near ark city 
last summer 
his hopper went screwy
and dumped 4000 pounds
of wheat on him 
poor fellow drowned in it 
he suffocated before
they could get to him 
  i know the story 
  his farm s going under 
he owed us  uh  i mean 
the fha a lot of money 
why you working on a saturday  joseph 
is something wrong 
they re going to foreclose 
why now 
prices aren t
what they used to be 
a strong harvest
is what brought
those prices down 
that could change next year 
there s no way for
you to come out on top 
i could sell the animals 
i ll sell some of the machinery 
the animals aren t worth much 
you already sold
most of the machinery 
there s got to be a way 
  banks said they would back   
  your bank s going under  too 
i m sorry 
they re just
trying to get rid of us 
i m not sure who  they  are 
the only way to
fix this is money 
i m talking beg 
borrow  steal 
time for pride is over  patty 
libby 
what you re about to tell us
is very  very important 
did ben kill your mom
and your sisters 
you were in the house
when it happened  so tell us 
it was ben 
he killed them  right 
listen  i ve been thinking 
if i were to look
into this case some more 
is that something your club
would be able to finance 
you changed your mind 
no  as far as i m concerned
ben is the killer  but   
i need money 
i m willing to offer
your club three weeks
of my life in exchange 
that doesn t sound very noble 
  whatever 
  no  wait  libby  libby 
do you really have
no contact with runner 
no 
well  it might be a good idea
to track him down 
although  personally
i don t think runner did it 
what s your theory 
i m not quite ready
to share that yet 
oh  come on 
if ben is so innocent 
why doesn t he try to get out 
maybe you should
go talk to him 
no 
we start with
other people first 
what is it 
is it a money thing 
i just don t like
wasting my time  okay 
okay 
how about     300 
where do you get this money 
as treasurer 
i have a certain amount
of discretionary funds 
this is the project
i choose to use them for 
what  what s so funny 
you re a noble embezzler 
that s what s funny 
  that makes you almost likable 
  thanks 
i need 500 more  an advance 
why 
 cause i got to get
my car out of the shop 
it s been held hostage
for the last six months 
i m going to need a car

he killed them 
i m serious 
libby  go talk to him

just to prove
you freaks wrong 
make that fat bitch magda cry 
i think   
i saw ben as i was standing
at the door of my mom s room 
he was threatening
her with our shotgun 
satan encourages you
to do what feels good 
because we re all
basically animals 
settle down  quiet 
benjamin  you do understand
this is very serious  don t you 
hi  libby

a couple of fans outside 
people who take you
for the victim  well played 
i thought about you
a lot over the years 
every once in a while 
someone tells me about you
but it s not the same

unless you requested this one 
remember that horse  yellow 
yellow 
the famous horse that
refused to be ridden

a good hold of him 
he threw me against the fence
and slammed my hand
against a nail

thing will work out  
maybe i won t be
so fucking lonely 
we can talk about
a goddamn horse 
that s all i m asking for 
something
just as tiny as that 
i don t remember the horse 
yellow 
it was a dirty old farm horse 
but it was your horse 
how come i can t remember him 
you were pretty young
when mom had to sell him

but she needed the money 
i can tell you all about him 
go ahead  ask the question 
i don t need to ask 
i know you killed them

boy in a house full of girls 
at school i was the kid
that nobody paid attention to 
in that court room 
people were scared of me 
i was a bad ass

you should have done

so we can get some money 
get the hell out of here 
teenagers across
america are playing
with a new and
frightening game 
satanism 
their school books are marked
up by satanic symbols 
they are seduced
by heavy metal heroes 
many of whom
feature satanic imagery
in their songs
and album covers 
the fixation on violence 
evil and death
leads them to commit
abominable crimes 
including human sacrifice and
sexual abuse of children 
we re in the very throes
of a new satanic age   
everyone at the time 
police  judges  the psychiatric community 
they were seeing
satanists everywhere 
and there weren t 
a few lost 
frustrated kids take
those lyrics too literally 
yes 
but real criminal satanists 
what did
the investigation say 
the crime scene
was contaminated 
people traipsing in and out
of the house all day
was against all the rules of police
procedure  but no one cared 
they had the perfect culprit 
a strange teenage boy that
no one in town liked much
and listened to heavy metal 
you know  it was convenient 
i ve got the files so
you can take a look 
libby  it s not a request 
it s part of the job 
seriously  it s like
you guys want ben out
more than he does 
it s ridiculous 
what did you think of him 
i don t know  lyle 
did you ever hear about him
with his serious girlfriend 
molly or polly 
something like that 
no  it doesn t ring a bell 
it s probably nothing 
he had a tattoo
of it on his arm 
it s probably another magda 
will you just tell me 
just tell me 
who do you think did it 
i think lou cates did it 
krissi cates  father 
found out he had
a history of violence 
went to jail for
aggravated battery 
you still have no idea
who krissi cates is  do you 
no 
libby   
come on 
i know you hate doing this 
but could you try 
you re stuck with us anyway 
just try  you re smart 
you ll see for yourself that
something s not right  just   
just take a look
at the folder 
come on  you ll see  please 
since i was seven
i d only seen flashes of ben 
like some evil entity
in a haunted house 
but i d forgotten there
was once just ben 
my brother 
shy  serious 
couldn t have done
what they said 
what i said 
the molestation of krissi cates
and the murders weren t legally linked 
but everyone had heard the rumors and the
jury was surely poisoned against him 
oddly 
all the little girls backed down and the
cates family never pressed charges 
the kill club found krissi cates
mother in emporia  kansas 
but she d never returned
their calls 
you never leave a message for
someone you really want to reach 
you keep calling and calling
until somebody picks up 
out of anger  curiosity
or just fear 
hello 
hello 
i m so sorry 
did i just wake you up 
i didn t realize
how late it was 
i can call back later 
who is this 
my name is stephanie adams 
i m an old friend of krissi s 
  i was just looking for her   
  christ  you people won t stop calling
until i give you
what you want  right 
i have no idea what
you re talking about  ma am 
i m just an old friend
looking for her 
i thought maybe
you could help me 
what was your name  sally 
yeah  my name is sally adams 
listen  sally 
i ve remarried and
i have very little contact
with my previous family 
got it 
you don t by chance have a number
for lou or know where i can find him 
lou would be in some bar
in kansas  i d guess 
as for krissi  drive west on i 70 
just past columbia 
take a left into
the giant strip club 
you ll find her 
don t call again 
mrs  day  i ve called
you down to the precinct
due to some serious
allegations about your son 
how s he regarded in school 
is he a popular kid 
he has lots of friends 
from what we understand 
he s a bit of a loner 
so what does that prove 
you have four children 
correct 
yes 
same father 
yes 
mrs  day 
we ve got four little girls who say that
ben touched them in their private areas 
that he took them to some farm
and performed certain   
   acts associated with
ritualistic devil worship 
some farm 
ben doesn t even have a car 
you don t know ben 
satanic worship
is not uncommon 
it s made its way into
all areas of the community 
and part of their rituals involve
the degradation of children 
do you have any evidence 
any witnesses 
besides some
12 year old girls   
we got the note ben left

he really fucked up my life

i was 11 and he was 16 
he started hanging around
with me after school 
i got that a lot 
i was a cute kid 
and we had lots of money 
go on 
he would take me
into the closet
and make me
perform oral sex on him
while making me
pledge allegiance to satan 
hey  baby 
let me get a bag of chips 
you don t mind  do you 
anyway  ben was
pretty sneaky with me 
i mean 
he had an altar in there 
upside down cross 
some dead animals 
sacrificed things 
that s why i thought that he was
working his way up to killing me 
but he killed
his family instead 
his whole family
was devil worshiping 
um   
how did your dad react when
you told him what ben had done to you 
god  he was so over protective 
he went totally ballistic 
sometimes i think 
had my dad had found ben 
he would have killed him and
ben s family would still be alive 
your dad live around here 
no  we lost touch 
hey  can you lend me 20 bucks

my mom usually didn t move
when i got in bed with her 
but  that night 
she turned to me and told me she loved me 
she hardly ever told us
she loved us 
that s why i remember it 
i can t dwell
on these thoughts 
i ve labeled these memories as if they
were a particularly dangerous region 
dark place 
michelle s diary 
i d forgotten what a rotten
busy body michelle was 
in her last pages

but mom  i don t like ben 
he s bad

  hello

i ve had a rough day 
yes  i heard about ben 
i wasn t going to phone you 
but how should i say this 
patty  i trust you 
i pray for you  i may have
a solution to your problem 
i thought we were
out of options 
not entirely 
  yeah 
  libby  libby 
we found diondra sue wertzner 
born on march 28th  1968 
was officially reported missing on
october 19th  1985  and has never been found 
so what the fuck
does that mean  she s dead 
i don t know  we can t be sure 
but did ben tell you anything 
hang on 
hey  told you
i d pay you back 
when i saw your name
on that note   
i should have
recognized you right away 
but i kinda
followed your story 
but it s been
such a long time ago 
what do you want 
you re not gonna make this
easy for me  are you 
fair enough 
i was a pretty girl 
i was good in school 
and ben   
he did volunteer work 
he gave drawing lessons 
i had a big crush on him 
we started
hanging out together 
i know we were both kids 
but he was old enough 
to not have encouraged me 
it was my first
big grown up kiss 
it only lasted about a second 
and afterwards  of course 
he told me that we should never do it again 
 cause it was wrong 
but he kept writing me notes 
but he refused to spend
any more time with me 
and i was furious 
then  about a week later
i went to a slumber party
and i told all the girls about
my high school boyfriend 
all proud 
and i made up things that we did 
and from there
it just snowballed 
we made up this
whole imaginary world 
where ben was
a devil worshiper 
kind of stories we saw on the news
every day when we were kids 
ma am 
your son is about to be arrested 
and i know what for 
in this next year you
will need some money
so you can keep
your children at home 
and you will
need a good lawyer 
 cause you don t want your son
going to prison labeled a child molester 
what do you have to offer 
now i myself
was once a farmer 
my dad before me
and his dad before him 
but we farmers 
we d been swindled 
 plant fence post to
fence post   they said 
 oh  and then buy
more land  because 
 well  they ain t
making any more of it  
then  whoops   we re sorry 
we gave you some bad advice 
 we ll just take your farm  
what does this have
to do with my son 
ma am 
i m no businessman 
and i m no judge 
i m certainly no politician 
but if you re brave enough 
i ll give you a real chance
to help your family 
your brother needs you  libby 
he doesn t  and he s been
pretty clear about that 
now that you ve explored the
case with all its inconsistencies 
don t you think that ben
deserves a new  fair trial 
based on what evidence 
what do we know for sure 
he s lying about diondra  why 
but  everybody s a liar 
i lied to get you to kc 
you lied when you said you
saw what happened that day 
it doesn t make us murderers 
what makes you so sure i lied 
why are you so
obsessed with this case 
it s not even your story 
it s mine 
it s a fascinating puzzle 
a mystery with lots of different theories 
most of all  there s you
and ben and krissi 
kids who started events that became bigger
than them and had major repercussions 
  i m fascinated by that 
  why 
you ever heard about those
wildfires near san bernardino in 1999 
they destroyed  like  80 homes
and about 90 000 acres 
i don t know  seems like
california is always burning 
i was the kid
who set that fire 
then shouldn t you have become
a firefighter or something 
overcome your trauma that way 
so  did you 
did i what 
did you lie that day in court 
hello 
hello 
  can i help you 
  hey 
we re looking
for trey teepano 
that d be me 
want to talk to you about ben day

he said you were a bookie or something 
back then

me a lot of money 
still does  i guess  huh 
it doesn t mean i know what
happened in your house that night 
you were into
devil worshiping 
i m reformed now 
i m a good god fearin  indian 
you remember diondra wertzner 
your brother 
your brother was
crazy about that girl 
parents neglected her 
so she was always creating drama 
she d run away 
come back home 
total soap opera 
this time  i guess 
she just ran away for good  huh 
she s been listed as a
missing person for 25 years 
yeah 
she was one of them girls
who was always
trying to be someone else 
she d talk in an english accent one day
and next day it d be southern 
she liked to use
her porn name  too 
  she did porn 
  no 
it was that game 
what was the name of your childhood pet 
and what was the name
of the street you grew up on 
rural route 2 
well 
that s not going to work 
it s supposed to sound slutty 
you know 
like bambi evergreen 
what was diondra s   
it was  uh  polly something   
polly palm 
what was the name your brother
had tattooed on his arm 
  oh  my god 
  it was polly  right 
i got her  polly palm
in kearney  missouri 
the only one listed
in the whole country
apart for a nail boutique
in shreveport

i don t feel good 
i think i need something to eat 
what 
you re fucked

molested all these girls 
hey  diondra  it s jenny 
i hear ben s running from the cops 
you re not with him  are you 
please tell me you re not with him 
i guess i should go home 
okay  and what 
leave me here
while you go to jail 
what do you want me to do 
we re leaving town tonight 
i have like  200
left from my parents

you d find me someday 
smart girl 
stay 
so  this is out of the blue 
i mean  why come
looking for me now 
did ben say something to you 
no  that s why i m here 
so you think that
once you know the truth 
you ll find peace 
like  somehow
that will fix you 
i was with ben that night 
we were going to skip town 
and he went to his house
to get some money 
an hour goes by  two hours 
finally 
i thought he lost his nerve 
cried myself to sleep
that night 
in the morning  when i heard
about the murders 
packed my bags 
left a note for my father
telling him i was not
his little girl anymore 
skipped town for good 
ben never gave
my name to the police 
after all these years 
he protected me 
so  no one but him knows
what happened that night 
i do think you that
you could find this peace
that you re looking for
if you accept that 
look  i hate to say this 
but whatever happened 
and as much as i loved ben 
he needed to be
in that prison 
there was something
inside your brother
that was not right
for the outside world 
you were pregnant

diondra wertzner 
also known as polly palm
was arrested last night
in amarillo  texas 
this is the latest development in
the 1985 kansas prairie massacre case 
ms  wertzner was wanted in relation
to the murder of michelle day
for which ben day 
her brother 
has been in prison
for the last 28 years 
she denies any involvement
while dna analysis is pending 
but it was announced
this morning that ben day
will be released
from prison shortly 
their daughter 
crystal  is still at large 
as a reminder 
this is the latest twist in a larger case 
that of serial killer
calvin diehl 
aka the angel of debt
who has killed 
or as he claims 
 helped to die in dignity  
more than 50 people
since the early 1980s 
he had each of his victims
sign what he termed
a  permission to kill  form
along with
a letter to loved ones 
dear ben  michelle 
libby and debby 
i don t think this letter
will ever reach you 
but mr  diehl said
he d hold it for me 
and i guess that
gives me some comfort 
your grandparents always told me 
 make a useful life  
i don t think i ve really done that 
but i can make a useful death 
my life has been determined
so much by accidents 
it seems nice now
that an accident on purpose
will make things right again 
i hope you all forgive me 
take care of yourselves 
i know diane
will do right by you 
i m only sad
i won t get to see
the wonderful people
you ve become 
although i don t need to 
that s how sure
i am of my kids 
diondra was always sure you d find her 
she was sure of it 
guess she was right 
so you met my daughter 
mmm hmm 
i ve heard different things 
is she   
is she like diondra 
is she bad 
i don t know 
how does a girl
deal with the fact
that she knows her mother
is a murderer 
she can t disappear
for long  i can find her 
she s not going to go
to jail because of me 
you d really give her a pass 
i know a little
bit about people
trying to do the right thing
and completely fucking up 
are you talking
about me or mom 
i m talking about me 
you could ve been
talking about any of us 
28 years i ve been
shutting up and taking it 
28 years i ve been protecting
a kid that i never met 
by leaving her with
your sister s murderer 
i never said
i did the right thing 
but i made a choice
and i had to live with it 
yeah 
i had to live with it  too 
but i do wish there was something
i could say to make it better 
there s nothing left to say 
you lied  i lied 
we re even 
what about us 
you don t know me  ben 
you think you do 
but you don t 
just like i don t know you 
or mom  or debby  or michelle 
whatever sliver of
a memory i had of them
died with them that night 
i m so angry at you 
but you re still my brother 
you re still my blood 
i won t let what happened that night 
drive my life anymore 
i just want to be normal 
i m sorry 
i m sorry  libby  i m sorry 
you know that horse you were talking about 
yellow 
yeah  what about him 
i don t get it 
why yellow 
i don t know 
mom named him 
it s not like he was
a yellow horse or anything 
i guess she ll keep
that secret with her  huh 
there s a lot of
other stories  libby 
beautiful ones 
wasn t all bad  you know 
i didn t get
straight on the highway 
but slowly drove to where
our farm had once been 
still standing 
that unsafe place 
that blanked out space where
my mother so desperately invited death 
maybe ben was right 
it wasn t all bad 
ben learned something in his
prison that i never learned in mine 
forgiveness 
my mom told us
