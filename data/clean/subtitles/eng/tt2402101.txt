and your sisters
you were in the house
when it happened
so tell us it was ben
he killed them right
i have a meanness inside me
real as an organ
its the day blood
somethings fuckin
wrong with it
i was eight the night they were
killed and suddenly i was famous
the little orphan girl of the
kansas prairie massacre
so strangers send me money
just enough for
me to do nothing

how much is left
do you read

sometimes
have you at least
listened to my messages

new phase of your life

hand me bulging shoe boxes full of mail

push the role players out
but too many guys

plus its a good
source of income for us

organization
among our ranks

private and insurance
investigators lawyers

you wouldnt like it so far
okay
but were not all like that
look just give me a chance
look at this in here
its a bunch of pis who think
theyve identified a serial killer
theyre about to
catch some guy
who has been crossing states
you know missouri kansas
oklahoma to help kill people
what do you mean help
they call him
the angel of debt
they think hes like
a jack kevorkian
for people with bad credit
good life insurance
and no way out
youll like our group
its serious no costumes
hi everyone its my honor
to present our special guest
and the star
of this years kill club
libby day
around 200 am
on october the 13th 1985
a person or persons killed
three members of the day family
in their farm house
in kinnakee kansas
the youngest child libby
escaped the killer through
a window in her mothers room
the oldest child benjamin
never produced an alibi
and was extremely
uncooperative with the police
libby testified
she saw ben
commit the murders
despite libbys
confused testimony
and young age
and despite a startling lack
of physical evidence
ben day was convicted
based largely on rumors that
he was involved in devil worship
you done
i think the general
consensus is that runner day
her father did it
i mean he goes to patty
tries to bully her for money
as usual gets nothing
and he goes haywire
i mean the guy
was crazy right
right i dont know
look i didnt know him
he left when i was like two
where is he now
i dont know
there was a blood stain
on michelles bed sheets
different blood type
than anyone in the family
but since the sheets
were from goodwill
prosecutor says that blood
could have come from anywhere
yeah we were poor
a lot of our shit
came from goodwill okay
do you remember anything
out of the ordinary
happening that day
like what
like how your mother reacted
to the krissi cates scandal
who
krissi cates
i dont know who that is
you mentioned
her in your book
i didnt write that book
i didnt even read it
what about trey teepano
what about ben day
you want to hear
what i have to say about him
please this is the grossest
miscarriage of justice ever
what is this womans deal
magda here is very involved in
the effort to free your brother
hes a wonderful man
he draws he writes poetry
you should get to know him libby
you really should
in three weeks
that window is going to close
what
in order to solve this crime
we need to compile
new evidence and
if you were inclined
you could recant your testimony
when we file for habeas corpus
but time is of the essence
what are you talking about
oh because of budget cuts
they are consolidating departments
and disposing of evidence
from cases
older than 10 years
which means
in three weeks time
bens file will be shredded
youre just a few people
who like murder
mysteries and true crimes
libby ben is innocent
and were trying to prove it
hes never even
filed for an appeal
hes had reason enough for
eight appeals but he has lost hope
good
please help
no
its not a conspiracy theory
hey dont be like that
get your hands off me
at least stay and
try and convince us
i told you she wouldnt
bother lazy little liar
yes thats what you are and
what youve always been
a liar
you dont know shit about
what happened that night
none of you
run run
no
libby libby
libby
theyre all dead
once i was in art class
and met a boy named ben

two different things
so like his drunken granddad
raped a chinese whore
you better watch your mouth
treys into
some scary ass shit
satanic shit
yeah we get into some
pretty dark shit sometimes
youre one of the guys
that killed the cows
we have to
its an order
bro thats a weird order
that was my hamburger
look at his face
sometimes things have to die
we have to kill them
just like jesus requires
sacrifice so does satan
mom is ben in trouble

michelle what do you want
i heard rumors
what kind of rumors
mom theres a car coming

where are your people
from originally ireland
germany
my maiden name was krause
there was another
german farmer near ark city
last summer
his hopper went screwy
and dumped 4000 pounds
of wheat on him
poor fellow drowned in it
he suffocated before
they could get to him
i know the story
his farms going under
he owed us uh i mean
the fha a lot of money
why you working on a saturday joseph
is something wrong
theyre going to foreclose
why now
prices arent
what they used to be
a strong harvest
is what brought
those prices down
that could change next year
theres no way for
you to come out on top
i could sell the animals
ill sell some of the machinery
the animals arent worth much
you already sold
most of the machinery
theres got to be a way
banks said they would back
your banks going under too
im sorry
theyre just
trying to get rid of us
im not sure who they are
the only way to
fix this is money
im talking beg
borrow steal
time for pride is over patty
libby
what youre about to tell us
is very very important
did ben kill your mom
and your sisters
you were in the house
when it happened so tell us
it was ben
he killed them right
listen ive been thinking
if i were to look
into this case some more
is that something your club
would be able to finance
you changed your mind
no as far as im concerned
ben is the killer but
i need money
im willing to offer
your club three weeks
of my life in exchange
that doesnt sound very noble
whatever
no wait libby libby
do you really have
no contact with runner
no
well it might be a good idea
to track him down
although personally
i dont think runner did it
whats your theory
im not quite ready
to share that yet
oh come on
if ben is so innocent
why doesnt he try to get out
maybe you should
go talk to him
no
we start with
other people first
what is it
is it a money thing
i just dont like
wasting my time okay
okay
how about 300
where do you get this money
as treasurer
i have a certain amount
of discretionary funds
this is the project
i choose to use them for
what whats so funny
youre a noble embezzler
thats whats funny
that makes you almost likable
thanks
i need 500 more an advance
why
cause i got to get
my car out of the shop
its been held hostage
for the last six months
im going to need a car
all right
you better play ball

go see ben
it all starts with him
no it all ends with him
he killed them
im serious
libby go talk to him
fine ill talk to him
just to prove
you freaks wrong
make that fat bitch magda cry
i think
i saw ben as i was standing
at the door of my moms room
he was threatening
her with our shotgun
satan encourages you
to do what feels good
because were all
basically animals
settle down quiet
benjamin you do understand
this is very serious dont you

so we can get some money
get the hell out of here
teenagers across
america are playing
with a new and
frightening game
satanism
their school books are marked
up by satanic symbols
they are seduced
by heavy metal heroes
many of whom
feature satanic imagery
in their songs
and album covers
the fixation on violence
evil and death
leads them to commit
abominable crimes
including human sacrifice and
sexual abuse of children
were in the very throes
of a new satanic age
everyone at the time
police judges the psychiatric community
they were seeing
satanists everywhere
and there werent
a few lost
frustrated kids take
those lyrics too literally
yes
but real criminal satanists
what did
the investigation say
the crime scene
was contaminated
people traipsing in and out
of the house all day
was against all the rules of police
procedure but no one cared
they had the perfect culprit
a strange teenage boy that
no one in town liked much
and listened to heavy metal
you know it was convenient
ive got the files so
you can take a look
libby its not a request
its part of the job
seriously its like
you guys want ben out
more than he does
its ridiculous
what did you think of him
i dont know lyle
did you ever hear about him
with his serious girlfriend
molly or polly
something like that
no it doesnt ring a bell
its probably nothing
he had a tattoo
of it on his arm
its probably another magda
will you just tell me
just tell me
who do you think did it
i think lou cates did it
krissi cates father
found out he had
a history of violence
went to jail for
aggravated battery
you still have no idea
who krissi cates is do you
no
libby
come on
i know you hate doing this
but could you try
youre stuck with us anyway
just try youre smart
youll see for yourself that
somethings not right just
just take a look
at the folder
come on youll see please
since i was seven
id only seen flashes of ben
like some evil entity
in a haunted house
but id forgotten there
was once just ben
my brother
shy serious
couldnt have done
what they said
what i said
the molestation of krissi cates
and the murders werent legally linked
but everyone had heard the rumors and the
jury was surely poisoned against him
oddly
all the little girls backed down and the
cates family never pressed charges
the kill club found krissi cates
mother in emporia kansas
but shed never returned
their calls
you never leave a message for
someone you really want to reach
you keep calling and calling
until somebody picks up
out of anger curiosity
or just fear
hello
hello
im so sorry
did i just wake you up
i didnt realize
how late it was
i can call back later
who is this
my name is stephanie adams
im an old friend of krissis
i was just looking for her
christ you people wont stop calling

just past columbia

the giant strip club

mrs day ive called
you down to the precinct
due to some serious
allegations about your son

ben touched them in their private areas
that he took them to some farm
and performed certain
acts associated with
ritualistic devil worship
some farm
ben doesnt even have a car
you dont know ben
satanic worship
is not uncommon
its made its way into
all areas of the community
and part of their rituals involve
the degradation of children
do you have any evidence
any witnesses
besides some
12yearold girls
we got the note ben left
in krissi cates locker

i was 11 and he was 16
he started hanging around
with me after school

he would take me
into the closet
and make me
perform oral sex on him
while making me
pledge allegiance to satan
hey baby
let me get a bag of chips
you dont mind do you
anyway ben was
pretty sneaky with me
i mean
he had an altar in there
upsidedown cross
some dead animals
sacrificed things
thats why i thought that he was
working his way up to killing me
but he killed
his family instead
his whole family
was devil worshiping
um
how did your dad react when
you told him what ben had done to you
god he was so overprotective
he went totally ballistic
sometimes i think
had my dad had found ben
he would have killed him and
bens family would still be alive

yeah
libby libby
we found diondra sue wertzner
born on march 28th 1968
was officially reported missing on
october 19th 1985 and has never been found
so what the fuck
does that mean shes dead
i dont know we cant be sure
but did ben tell you anything
hang on
hey told you
id pay you back
when i saw your name
on that note
i should have
recognized you right away
but i kinda
followed your story
but its been
such a long time ago
what do you want
youre not gonna make this
easy for me are you
fair enough
i was a pretty girl
i was good in school
and ben
he did volunteer work
he gave drawing lessons
i had a big crush on him
we started
hanging out together
i know we were both kids
but he was old enough
to not have encouraged me
it was my first
big grownup kiss
it only lasted about a second
and afterwards of course
he told me that we should never do it again
cause it was wrong
but he kept writing me notes
but he refused to spend
any more time with me
and i was furious
then about a week later
i went to a slumber party
and i told all the girls about
my high school boyfriend
all proud
and i made up things that we did
and from there
it just snowballed
we made up this
whole imaginary world
where ben was
a devil worshiper
kind of stories we saw on the news
every day when we were kids
maam
your son is about to be arrested
and i know what for
in this next year you
will need some money
so you can keep
your children at home
and you will
need a good lawyer
cause you dont want your son
going to prison labeled a child molester
what do you have to offer
now i myself
was once a farmer
my dad before me
and his dad before him
but we farmers
wed been swindled
plant fence post to
fence post they said
oh and then buy
more land because
well they aint
making any more of it
then whoops were sorry
we gave you some bad advice
well just take your farm
what does this have
to do with my son
maam
im no businessman
and im no judge
im certainly no politician
but if youre brave enough
ill give you a real chance
to help your family
your brother needs you libby
he doesnt and hes been
pretty clear about that
now that youve explored the
case with all its inconsistencies
dont you think that ben
deserves a new fair trial
based on what evidence
what do we know for sure
hes lying about diondra why
but everybodys a liar
i lied to get you to kc
you lied when you said you
saw what happened that day
it doesnt make us murderers
what makes you so sure i lied
why are you so
obsessed with this case
its not even your story
its mine
its a fascinating puzzle
a mystery with lots of different theories
most of all theres you
and ben and krissi
kids who started events that became bigger
than them and had major repercussions
im fascinated by that
why
you ever heard about those
wildfires near san bernardino in 1999
they destroyed like 80 homes
and about 90000 acres
i dont know seems like
california is always burning
i was the kid
who set that fire
then shouldnt you have become
a firefighter or something
overcome your trauma that way
so did you
did i what
did you lie that day in court
hello
hello
can i help you
hey
were looking
for trey teepano

devil worshiping
im reformed now

you remember diondra wertzner
your brother
your brother was
crazy about that girl
parents neglected her

shes been listed as a
missing person for 25 years

she was one of them girls
who was always
trying to be someone else
shed talk in an english accent one day
and next day itd be southern
she liked to use

youll find peace
like somehow
that will fix you
i was with ben that night
we were going to skip town
and he went to his house
to get some money
an hour goes by two hours
finally
i thought he lost his nerve
cried myself to sleep
that night
in the morning when i heard
about the murders
packed my bags
left a note for my father
telling him i was not
his little girl anymore
skipped town for good
ben never gave
my name to the police
after all these years
he protected me
so no one but him knows
what happened that night
i do think you that
you could find this peace
that youre looking for
if you accept that
look i hate to say this
but whatever happened
and as much as i loved ben
he needed to be
in that prison

inside your brother

diondra wertzner
also known as polly palm
was arrested last night
in amarillo texas
this is the latest development in
the 1985 kansas prairie massacre case
ms wertzner was wanted in relation
to the murder of michelle day
for which ben day
her brother
has been in prison
for the last 28 years
she denies any involvement
while dna analysis is pending
but it was announced
this morning that ben day
will be released
from prison shortly
their daughter
crystal is still at large
as a reminder
this is the latest twist in a larger case
that of serial killer
calvin diehl
aka the angel of debt
who has killed
or as he claims
helped to die in dignity
more than 50 people
since the early 1980s
he had each of his victims
sign what he termed
a permission to kill form
along with
a letter to loved ones
dear ben michelle
libby and debby
i dont think this letter
will ever reach you
but mr diehl said
hed hold it for me
and i guess that
gives me some comfort
your grandparents always told me
make a useful life
i dont think ive really done that
but i can make a useful death
my life has been determined
so much by accidents
it seems nice now
that an accident on purpose
will make things right again
i hope you all forgive me
take care of yourselves
i know diane
will do right by you
im only sad
i wont get to see
the wonderful people
youve become
although i dont need to
thats how sure
i am of my kids
diondra was always sure youd find her
she was sure of it
guess she was right
so you met my daughter
mmmhmm
ive heard different things
is she
is she like diondra
is she bad
i dont know
how does a girl
deal with the fact
that she knows her mother
is a murderer
she cant disappear
for long i can find her
shes not going to go
to jail because of me
youd really give her a pass
i know a little
bit about people
trying to do the right thing
and completely fucking up
are you talking
about me or mom
im talking about me
you couldve been
talking about any of us
28 years ive been
shutting up and taking it
28 years ive been protecting
a kid that i never met
by leaving her with
your sisters murderer
i never said
i did the right thing
but i made a choice
and i had to live with it
yeah
i had to live with it too
but i do wish there was something
i could say to make it better
theres nothing left to say
you lied i lied
were even
what about us
you dont know me ben
you think you do
but you dont
just like i dont know you
or mom or debby or michelle
whatever sliver of
a memory i had of them
died with them that night
im so angry at you
but youre still my brother
youre still my blood
i wont let what happened that night
drive my life anymore
i just want to be normal
im sorry
im sorry libby im sorry
you know that horse you were talking about
yellow
yeah what about him
i dont get it
why yellow
i dont know
mom named him
its not like he was
a yellow horse or anything
i guess shell keep
that secret with her huh
theres a lot of
other stories libby
beautiful ones
wasnt all bad you know
i didnt get
straight on the highway
but slowly drove to where
our farm had once been
still standing
that unsafe place
that blankedout space where
my mother so desperately invited death
maybe ben was right
it wasnt all bad
ben learned something in his
prison that i never learned in mine
forgiveness
my mom told us
