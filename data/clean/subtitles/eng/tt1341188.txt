thats just negative thats like
though if you think about it
and i never did till now

just going through each others lives
until one day
you close the factory down
take one product home and use it
monogamously for the rest of your life
my mistake matty forget it
no im not
its not a mistake
im just saying that
if id given you one and hid the rest
id be a great guy
but because i was open with you
i said forget it
matty what am i doing
i caught myself
dont judge others
till you check yourself
youre lucky if its your fault
you can correct the situation
im nervous over something
thats going on with me
im with an attractive guy
youd be an idiot
to mistake for anything more
than just a fun friendship
and yes amazing sex
instead i give that guy a hard time
for just being who he is
totally my fault
im sorry
please forgive me
are you apologizing
yeah
if youre really apologizing
you may be my dream girl
i heard footsteps and im like
okay somebody nuts is coming back
to be more nuts
and now an apology
you may be my dream girl
yeah
they said youd be in here
how bad is this
the justice department is investigating
the company for security fraud
based on what why are they
they dont have to say
based on what why are they
they dont have to say
theyve subpoenaed
everything from abroad
you didnt tell your father the worst
of course i told him
no
yes
hes gonna meet us in my office
right now
your concern is
i dont have one
well we better go
i agree
morning
morning dad
we need the company lawyer for
whatever this is whats going on
you want a kiss too
not today
you havent read this yet
just once
they are investigating us
for misstatement of receivables
to inflate earnings
stock fraud
what do you know about it
nothing but im responsible
what are you being noble
im telling you what
recent legislation says
if its true and i didnt know
i should have
can you ask your assistant to come in
we have to respond immediately
annie could you please come on in
and bring your laptop
all these items mentioned
you must have checked whether we
had funds before talking to the analyst
no most of them came from
dads office so i assumed that
with everyone working
you do not assume
excuse me
you do not trust anyone
not him not me
cynicism is sanity
good guidelines im afraid
i assumed that with everyone
working creatively on the new line
creatively
just a second dad
now
let me finish
no drivel does not get to finish
drivel gets interrupted
is it possible to get the
so shaping the corporate culture
might not bring results
you are a fucking moron
too rough
much too rough
dont talk like that in front of annie
okay okay i caught myself
now may i get back to the
sorry annie the fucking
sorry again annie
point
i have overlooked every limitation
i know you to have
why because you are my son
and youre a good guy
as every prick with half a brain
who ever took advantage of you
knows absolutely
but gidge
there is a bottom line here
which is because of your
notions of trust and creativity
we may be inevitably forced to crawl
on by some assistant us attorney
and if this almost made
the law review creature
pins me between
a choice of saving you
or the company that i founded
and you preside over
i may be forced
to choose the company
even though doing so may break my
life forever which is finally my fault
for handing you a job
where your pathetic assumptions
or notions of trust
can cause such calamity
annie
oh my god im so sorry
excuse me
what darling are you crying
whats wrong
im fine oh my god im so sorry
charles annie just
ron
why dont you have annie take down
everything you need okay
okay
all right
you should go home now
and think about interviewing attorneys
i dont know if the company
will be allowed to pay
the company will pay
to the justice department
the individuals name is on here
all documents relating
to loan applications
all financial statements including
general ledgers income statements
oh god
the term document includes
but is not limited to all personal files
telephone messages and
just a minute
hello
george i have been
through things like this
and id like to give you some difficult
advice if you would like to hear it

give up illusions of containment
the hardest fact
is that
no matter what the outcome
it is unlikely you can ever again be
the person you have been until now

date son we are in
a rapidly evolving situation here
i must tell you i was afraid
to use the telephone
because
no no no dont tell me
im not ready to take on
anything that i cant handle
no you know what
i know exactly how to handle this
ill treat myself
like a company in trouble
what i think is you are just indulging
in a lot of neuroses
you take on too much
it becomes about how much
instead of how well you handle it
that applies now
stand still
no
you do not have the luxury
of not hearing this
are you making me literally run
from bad news
the chickenshit board has dec
i gotta go i have a date
what happened to you was horrific
stop acting tough
its the worst move
look at the time
hey everybody i have to leave
i have a date
what
now lise
yeah
lisa
nobodys buying this
we should protest
we should
smalls what do you want us to do
lisa
okay there is one thing
when i come to visit you at training
camp when youre getting ready
just dont feel funny talking to me
okay dont feel sad for me
because my biggest fear is that
you wont be yourselves around me
ive seen that and if that happened
it would just make me feel like l
like i didnt know you anymore
and i want to
i need to
just say okay lisa
okay lisa
god l
i gotta go i gotta go
hes waiting for me
i love you
love you love you
love you too
go lise
go lise
lise
hi
name please
im meeting george
madison
im not sure i forget
could that be him over there
ill bet that is him
thats the sort of day im having
you dont have to take me
thank you though
george
are you george
im lisa
very good of you to join me
yeah
how you doing
how are you doing
im great
yeah
yep
well treasure it
you okay
no im sorry
im not even aware that
i have to apologize this might not
be the best first impression
i i had
an unusual 24 hours
okay well the bad days
make the good ones better
so dont worry about it
is this an italian restaurant
yes its a very good one
oh yeah it looks good
lets get a drink
none for me
you know what youre right
yeah i shouldnt drink
dont let me stop you
no no no
believe me drinking too much
two nights in a row could be a mistake
i havent had anything since
lunch yesterday so im starving
you dont drink at all
i follow my fathers rule on drinking
which is
never drink to feel better
only drink to feel even better
thats fantastic
yep its a good one
thats great
but sometimes i think that
one drink can give you
a little better perspective
not for me
i guess it depends on the person
look if you wanna have a drink
have a drink keeping talking about it
i dont need permission to drink
if i want a drink ill order one
jesus do you know
i dont know you
im sorry im not good today
maybe i should say whats going on
i never talk about myself i should
no dont do that
george this is what im suggesting
that we eat
and that we dont work
at this conversation
lets just cut ourselves a break
yes
and give ourselves permission
to be quiet
for the whole dinner
completely quiet
can i talk to the waiter
as long as you dont tell him
about your day
i mean that
that was just what i needed
you take care of yourself
im just leaving my place
to go to dinner
good evening mr madison taxi
yes thank you tom
okay dad im ready
what happened
what if i come by later
the phone isnt
just tell me id rather use the rest of
the night processing the information
im sorry this is private
theres still some privacy left
the board is refusing to pay
your legal bills now
hey
i think i met a great girl
oh good there is a god
the girls needed to tell you
how they felt
its something isnt it
last time i saw that was
when a kid died in high school
and they left this stuff by the road
how about straight talk
i am very sensitive
to what youre going through
you know what you need most
right now
yes
what
insensitivity
yeah
who is it
its lisa
could you narrow it down
im not kidding right now
im not kidding right now
a good lisa come here get in
youre alone right
yeah
i was just working up the night
do you want me to be here
yes i do
okay
then this is what i need
if in the middle of the night
i start crying or
shaking or acting enormously upset
i dont want you to ask whats wrong
i want you to just ignore it
is that okay with you
actually thats my preference
okay good
have a seat my games coming up
matty reynolds gets him
the nationals win
good mechanics
yeah
okay lets go i got it
can you afford me
the firm is refusing to pay my legal
bills but my father is willing to help
you cant take money from him
not with his position on the board
what would your retainer be
three hundred thousand and another
three in escrow in case it goes to trial
i suppose i could sell
everything you can
okay
sit down
i dont wanna lie down
i said sit down
i dont think you did
yes i did i never ask someone
to lie down on a first visit
sorry
okay
so
why are you here
i have a month left on my insurance
and they pay up to six visits
i meant is there a difficulty
well
im sorry im gonna go
because this is just stupid
not that this is stupid but i mean
thank you for your time just for me
you know i mean not this
but thank you for understanding
all right
okay
okay
you know can i ask you
just one stupid question
no such thing
because im leaving
and im not gonna do this again
i was wondering if theres one general
thing youve found over the years
to be generally true
in a general way
that would help anyone
with any situation
thats a great question
yes
id say figure out what you want
and learn how to ask for it
okay
those are both really hard
yes but you came here
which was hard for you
and youre leaving right away
also hard
so youre tougher than
you think you are right now
thanks
i appreciate that
good luck
okay
i can see why people do this
thanks
im sorry i thought some of them
were bringing their wives
that usually changes
the behavior considerably
the rookie who lives here had this
maybe the best barbecue anywhere
flown in from houston
he bought a firstclass seat
so his friend could fly it in
wait till you taste it try the sauce
first thats how you judge
this place nails it and you know
no hard feelings
you can stay i just
i cant do this right now
theres christian athletes inside
well eat with them
do you ever wonder whats going on
in my life because you never ask
i thought i wasnt supposed to
is that just at night
this is you know what
what i think i mean is
i should tell you
whats going on with me
i got
oh god
i got cut
sorry
lets have some barbecue
and well talk about it thats
i dont wanna eat now
i cant
you dont wanna eat anything
i just cant
well
okay
ill go with you
okay
so im gonna go
to grad school at night
ill have to work a few jobs but
ive got the private coaching thing
and i lined up
this parttime retail thing
thats great
thats good i got that covered
i just have this problem
with my attitude
its like i have to get to the place where
i appreciate what the game gave me
and accept and even embrace
the obvious
that the time comes
for every athlete when they
its never gonna come for me
you know what
maybe we shouldnt talk
maybe we should watch tv
or something
no no no hold on come here
i hear everything youre saying
come sit over here im gonna set you
down and make you something to eat
we get a little food in your stomach
well both think better
you like inspirational stories
okay i got one for you
i knew a really good player once
and the coach cut him
and the guy just felt
he felt impotent
now youre probably feeling whatever
the female version of that word is
its the same word
dont let whats going on with you
make you give me a hard time
because thats not productive
im not
its the same word for women
impotent
okay tie goes to the pretty one
same word he was feeling impotent
just like you may be feeling
i dont think thats how i feel
can i finish my thought
maybe itll help maybe it wont
but im trying
im sorry
thats all right
go ahead
okay so his girlfriend had a cat
and he started to save the cats shit
a little trust
okay
he started to save all the cats shit
and every few days or so
hed take a little amount and wrap it
in a different package like a gift
or a magazine roll
or something you order online
every few days for eight months
he would send these cat turds
to the guy who cut him
is that it
yeah thats it its a great story
did you understand it was the coach
he sent it to
to the guy who cut him
he felt impotent and then he
file it away it worked for this guy
no so he stopped
when his anger went away
yeah yeah
well the cat died
oh god
there a smile
thats horrible
i didnt know the cat was gonna die
you feel better
great i hated seeing you
touch bottom
that was sweet
yeah youre right
its okay
you are amazing
you were great
it takes two you know
at least
creep
oh boy
you clap to bring on the lights
the minute we finish
why whats the matter
just clapping your hands and
those dumb lights makes me feel like
wait wait let me guess
i think i can get it
like im not thinking about you
look who got it
yeah look who read your mind
god
yeah what should i do
god turn them off
you wanna do it come on
oh its fun
grow up
no
it was kind of fun wasnt it
im gonna teach you
how to have fun
you didnt see that
what
let me ask you something
how do you know when youre in love
intriguing
ryan get loose
well
what
i got a way
whenever this one thing happens
i know im done
its personal i dont want
anyone making fun of me
no no ones go
im in love with somebody when
i wear a condom with the other girls
holy shit im in love
hello
you up for a crazy idea
yes
maybe itd be fun if you
kind of move in with me
hello are you there
barely
are you serious
i know
i told you it was crazy
can you give me a minute
to form a thought
yeah yeah take your time
okay thanks
okay ill call you back
that was quick
i know but lisa listen
today i caught myself
thanks bobby
today i caught myself wishing
you were in the bullpen with me
literally having a daydream
i mean thats serious
li are you there
hello what are you doing
i think im thinking
dont you shouldnt have to think
about a great idea
you said this was a crazy idea
i know i think its both i think part of
the greatness is how crazy it is
what first popped into your mind
that i dont know what to say
and it makes me feel stupid
second thing
that ive never lived
with anyone before
great no ones had a chance
to ruin you
have you ever lived with anybody
with me you get into what does
living together mean
and duration is a factor
but listen is do you think
this is something
do you wanna do this
hello
i honestly
yeah
i dont know how to figure this out
is there tingling
do you have goose bumps
maybe i need to work my voice
a little bit until you get them
i think i just got them
what
i think i just got them
yeah
i really like you matty
okay
good phone call
good phone call
right yeah
thank you
this is such a mistake
overstepping alert
you sublet your apartment
you told me dont do anything halfway
unless youre willing to be half happy
dont make important life decisions
when you are mush its too dangerous
fight low selfesteem
dont give it the wheel
i am packed here i am doing this
so back off or do what you always do
for me pull out some damn positives
im sorry honey
positives
hell the guy has
a 94mileanhour fastball
he makes 14 million a year
go get him
got your bag i cleared some space
yeah i just
yeah come on in
okay
okay i can get rid of
both of these things right here
ill talk to the guys downstairs
they have storage space
its okay
well make it work
hey boss its me
annie
hi did you call that girl
no you dont have to bring me food
its enough that you found this place
that was selfish you dress up
my neighborhood love your window
its great
this is
cooking relaxes me when i cant
sleep so why not just call her
honestly because my
first impression wasnt great
id rather be more myself
when i see her next
what if someone beats you to her
optimism is sanity for me right now
please sit down
make yourself comfortable
relax
look
im in a funny position
but i know stuff about
what happened at work
i cant tell you
because of that thing i signed
but if you start guessing i cant help
it if this face is an open book look
stop youd get in trouble and just
listening could be wrongdoing for me
this information is killing me
its like i know someone is gonna
shoot you and i cant scream
watch out that mans gonna
blow your frigging head off
please play this game with me
or ill just tell you
no
for gods sake let me unburden
stop stop
annie sit down please sit down
careful you have to understand
what this is like for me right now
picture a very angry ocean a storm
and im on this little tiny boat
and miraculously
this boat is still afloat
and that boat is that
i havent done anything wrong
like letting you say something youre
legally constrained from revealing
not doing anything wrong is
whats keeping me afloat all right
if i lose that im gone
dont rock the boat
i know about the boat
stop
its a terrible boat get out of the boat
respect me on this
for what its worth it doesnt matter
i think ive guessed
the same stuff you know
i think i know what you do
nope
you couldnt function if you knew
what im talking about
oh i think i could
i think i am
leave it
what if i give you a hint
no dont dont make me
leave my own apartment please

are you coming to my place
almost there
good
i have some disturbing news
what
ill wait till you get here

one piece of bad news
without someone studying me
to see how i take it
anger can be useful

that they are going to indict you
i have canceled
everything ive got
and i am dedicating myself
completely to this
