  congratulations 
  thank you 
yeah  lisa 
so basically we re down to
three choices for the last slot 
lisa s here to see you 
i m glad you re meeting with her   
   because when it comes to this girl 
the intangibles are everything 
she s been the heartbeat
of this program 
just let me think for a second 
she did the olympics and
two championships without an error 
  she practices  what 
  three hours every day 
she makes everyone better  coach 
i have the benefit of being new here 
lisa is 31 
she s 0 3 seconds slower
moving towards first 
i m tired of justifying myself because
you re hung up on her as a role model 
nobody s gonna change his mind 
it s over 
  what s that 
  it s your call 
hooray  thank you  thank you 
at least let her know today 
she ll have to redirect her life 
everyone finds out when
i post it online  no exceptions 
because we field women athletes   
   doesn t mean we get girly

no  no  no 
i feel like i m on an assembly line
that s just spitting out girls 
that s just negative  that s like   
though if you think about it 
and i never did till now   
   we re all on kind of an assembly line 
just going through each other s lives 
until one day 
you close the factory down   
   take one product home and use it
monogamously for the rest of your life 
  my mistake  matty  forget it 
  no  i m not   
it s not a mistake 
i m just saying that   
if i d given you one and hid the rest 
i d be a great guy 
  but because i was open with you   
  i said  forget it 
matty  what am i doing 
i caught myself 
don t judge others
till you check yourself 
you re lucky if it s your fault 
you can correct the situation 
i m nervous over something
that s going on with me 
i m with an attractive guy
you d be an idiot   
   to mistake for anything more
than just a fun friendship 
and  yes  amazing sex 
instead  i give that guy a hard time
for just being who he is 
totally my fault 
i m sorry 
please forgive me 
  are you apologizing 
  yeah 
if you re really apologizing 
you may be my dream girl 
i heard footsteps and i m like 
 okay  somebody nuts is coming back
to be more nuts  
and now  an apology 
you may be my dream girl 
yeah 
they said you d be in here 
how bad is this 
the justice department is investigating
the company for security fraud 
  based on what  why are they    
  they don t have to say 
  based on what  why are they    
  they don t have to say 
they ve subpoenaed
everything from abroad 
  you didn t tell your father  the worst   
  of course i told him 
  no 
  yes 
he s gonna meet us in my office
right now 
  your concern is 
  i don t have one 
well  we better go 
i agree 
  morning 
  morning  dad 
we need the company lawyer for
whatever this is  what s going on 
  you want a kiss too 
  not today 
  you haven t read this yet 
  just once 
they are investigating us   
   for misstatement of receivables
to inflate earnings 
  stock fraud 
  what do you know about it 
nothing  but i m responsible 
what  are you being noble 
i m telling you what
recent legislation says 
if it s true and i didn t know 
i should have 
can you ask your assistant to come in 
we have to respond immediately 
annie  could you please come on in 
and bring your laptop 
all these items mentioned   
   you must have checked whether we
had funds before talking to the analyst 
no  most of them came from
dad s office  so i assumed that   
   with everyone working   
  you do not assume 
  excuse me 
  you do not trust anyone 
not him  not me 
cynicism is sanity 
good guidelines  i m afraid 
i assumed that with everyone
working creatively on the new line   
 creatively  
just a second  dad 
  now   
  let me finish 
no  drivel does not get to finish 
drivel gets interrupted 
is it possible to get the    
so shaping the corporate culture
might not bring results   
you are a fucking moron 
  too rough 
  much too rough 
  don t talk like that in front of annie 
  okay  okay  i caught myself 
now may i get back to the   
sorry  annie  the fucking   
sorry again  annie 
  point 
i have overlooked every limitation
i know you to have 
why  because you are my son 
and you re a good guy 
as every prick with half a brain   
   who ever took advantage of you
knows absolutely 
but  gidge 
there is a bottom line here   
   which is  because of your
notions of trust and creativity   
   we may be inevitably forced to crawl
on by some assistant u s  attorney 
and if this  almost made
the law review  creature   
   pins me between
a choice of saving you   
   or the company that i founded
and you preside over   
   i may be forced
to choose the company   
   even though doing so may break my
life forever  which is finally my fault   
   for handing you a job
where your pathetic assumptions   
   or notions of trust
can cause such calamity 
annie 
oh  my god  i m so sorry 
excuse me 
what  darling  are you crying 
what s wrong 
i m fine  oh  my god  i m so sorry 
  charles  annie just   
  ron 
why don t you have annie take down
everything you need  okay 
  okay 
  all right 
you should go home now
and think about interviewing attorneys 
i don t know if the company
will be allowed to pay 
the company will pay 
to the justice department 
the individual s name is on here 
all documents relating
to loan applications 
all financial statements  including
general ledgers  income statements   
oh  god 
the term  document  includes 
but is not limited to  all personal files   
   telephone messages  and   
just a minute 
hello 
george  i have been
through things like this   
   and i d like to give you some difficult
advice  if you would like to hear it 
okay 
accept the enormity 
give up illusions of containment 
the hardest fact   
   is that 
no matter what the outcome   
   it is unlikely you can ever again be
the person you have been until now 
okay  thanks 
look  can i call you later 
any further contact between us
would be inappropriate 
good luck  george 
is bryant there yet 
yeah  it s george

thank you 
hi  this is george

you know i underplay  so i don t
understand your failure to call back 
thank you 
well  tell me 
you must have some reaction 
no  i have one 
i m just not proud of it

i was thinking about my work 
let me explain the thought 
this is for us  i swear it 
we are not well matched
for this interval in your life 
not with me against this deadline
and you being investigated 
i don t want our relationship
to become cannon fodder   
   for this apparition
in your working life 
i will be here for you at the end 
you can count on that

  hello 
  hi  lisa  this is george 
george madison 
i    i m not sure how to
further identify myself 
your voice sounds a little familiar 
i made this incredibly stupid
phone call to you a few days ago 
oh  right  how you doing  george 
would you like to have dinner 
  but aren t you 
  no  i am not 
  you see   
  you don t have to explain 
i m sort of seeing somebody

  i have made a date 
  bye 
good night 
come on  come on 
georgie  george 
  let s go inside 
  i have a date 
date  son  we are in
a rapidly evolving situation here 
i must tell you  i was afraid
to use the telephone 
because 
no  no  no  don t tell me 
i m not ready to take on
anything that i can t handle 
no  you know what 
i know exactly how to handle this 
i ll treat myself
like a company in trouble 
what i think is you are just indulging
in a lot of neuroses 
you take on too much 
it becomes about how much   
   instead of how well you handle it 
that applies now 
  stand still 
  no 
you do not have the luxury
of not hearing this 
are you making me literally run
from bad news 
the chickenshit board has dec   
i gotta go  i have a date 
what happened to you was horrific 
  stop acting tough 
  it s the worst move 
look at the time 
hey  everybody  i have to leave 
i have a date 
  what 
  now  lise 
  yeah 
  lisa 
nobody s buying this 
  we should protest 
  we should 
smalls  what do you want us to do 
  lisa 
  okay  there is one thing 
when i come to visit you at training
camp when you re getting ready   
   just don t feel funny talking to me 
okay  don t feel sad for me 
because my biggest fear is that
you won t be yourselves around me 
i ve seen that  and if that happened 
it would just make me feel like l   
like i didn t know you anymore 
and i want to 
i need to 
just say   okay  lisa  
okay  lisa 
god  l   
i gotta go  i gotta go 
he s waiting for me 
  i love you 
  love you  love you 
  love you too 
  go  lise 
  go  lise 
  lise 
  hi 
  name  please 
i m meeting george   
  madison 
  i m not sure  i forget 
could that be him over there 
i ll bet that is him 
that s the sort of day i m having 
you don t have to take me 
thank you  though 
george 
are you george 
i m lisa 
  very good of you to join me 
  yeah 
how you doing 
how are you doing 
i m great 
  yeah 
  yep 
well  treasure it 
you okay 
no  i m sorry 
i m not even aware that   
i have to apologize  this might not
be the best first impression 
i    i had   
   an unusual 24 hours 
okay  well  the bad days
make the good ones better 
so don t worry about it 
is this an italian restaurant 
yes  it s a very good one 
oh  yeah  it looks good 
  let s get a drink 
  none for me 
you know what  you re right 
yeah  i shouldn t drink 
  don t let me stop you 
  no  no  no 
believe me  drinking too much
two nights in a row could be a mistake 
i haven t had anything since
lunch yesterday  so i m starving 
you don t drink at all 
  i follow my father s rule on drinking 
  which is 
never drink to feel better 
only drink to feel even better 
that s fantastic 
yep  it s a good one 
that s great 
but sometimes i think that   
   one drink can give you
a little better perspective 
not for me 
i guess it depends on the person 
look  if you wanna have a drink 
have a drink  keeping talking about it   
i don t need permission to drink 
if i want a drink  i ll order one 
jesus  do you know
i don t know you 
i m sorry  i m not good today 
maybe i should say what s going on 
i never talk about myself  i should 
no  don t do that 
george  this is what i m suggesting 
that we eat 
and that we don t work
at this conversation 
  let s just cut ourselves a break   
  yes 
   and give ourselves permission
to be quiet 
for the whole dinner 
completely quiet 
can i talk to the waiter 
as long as you don t tell him
about your day 
i mean  that   
that was just what i needed 
you take care of yourself 
i m just leaving my place
to go to dinner 
  good evening  mr  madison  taxi 
  yes  thank you  tom 
okay  dad  i m ready 
what happened 
what if i come by later 
the phone isn t   
just tell me  i d rather use the rest of
the night processing the information 
i m sorry  this is private 
there s still some privacy left 
the board is refusing to pay   
   your legal bills  now   
  hey 
i think i met a great girl 
oh  good  there is a god 
the girls needed to tell you
how they felt 
it s something  isn t it 
last time i saw that was
when a kid died in high school   
   and they left this stuff by the road 
how about straight talk 
i am very sensitive
to what you re going through 
you know what you need most
right now 
  yes 
  what 
insensitivity 
yeah 
  who is it 
  it s lisa 
could you narrow it down 
i m not kidding right now 
i m not kidding right now 
a good lisa  come here  get in 
  you re alone  right 
  yeah 
i was just working up the night 
do you want me to be here 
  yes  i do 
  okay 
then this is what i need 
if in the middle of the night
i start crying or   
   shaking or acting enormously upset 
i don t want you to ask what s wrong 
i want you to just ignore it 
is that okay with you 
  actually  that s my preference 
  okay  good 
have a seat  my game s coming up 
matty reynolds gets him 
the nationals win 
  good mechanics 
  yeah 
okay  let s go  i got it 
can you afford me 
the firm is refusing to pay my legal
bills  but my father is willing to help 
you can t take money from him 
not with his position on the board 
what would your retainer be 
three hundred thousand  and another
three in escrow in case it goes to trial 
  i suppose i could sell   
  everything you can 
okay 
  sit down 
  i don t wanna lie down 
  i said   sit down  
  i don t think you did 
yes  i did  i never ask someone
to lie down on a first visit 
  sorry 
  okay 
so   
   why are you here 
i have a month left on my insurance
and they pay up to six visits 
i meant  is there a difficulty 
well   
i m sorry  i m gonna go
because this is just stupid 
not that this is stupid  but i mean   
thank you for your time  just for me 
you know  i mean  not this 
  but thank you for understanding 
  all right 
  okay 
  okay 
you know  can i ask you
just one stupid question 
no such thing 
because i m leaving
and i m not gonna do this again 
i was wondering if there s one general
thing you ve found over the years   
   to be generally true   
   in a general way
that would help anyone   
   with any situation 
that s a great question 
yes 
i d say  figure out what you want
and learn how to ask for it 
okay 
those are both really hard 
yes  but you came here 
which was hard for you 
and you re leaving right away 
also hard 
so you re tougher than
you think you are right now 
thanks 
i appreciate that 
  good luck 
  okay 
  i can see why people do this 
  thanks 
i m sorry  i thought some of them
were bringing their wives 
that usually changes
the behavior considerably 
the rookie who lives here had this 
maybe the best barbecue anywhere   
   flown in from houston 
he bought a first class seat
so his friend could fly it in 
wait till you taste it  try the sauce
first  that s how you judge 
  this place nails it  and you know   
  no hard feelings 
you can stay  i just   
i can t do this right now 
there s christian athletes inside 
we ll eat with them 
do you ever wonder what s going on
in my life  because you never ask 
i thought i wasn t supposed to 
is that just at night 
this is    you know what 
what i think i mean is   
   i should tell you
what s going on with me 
i got   
oh  god 
i got cut 
sorry 
let s have some barbecue
and we ll talk about it  that s   
i don t wanna eat now 
i can t 
you don t wanna eat anything 
i just can t 
well   
okay 
i ll go with you 
okay 
so i m gonna go
to grad school at night 
i ll have to work a few jobs  but
i ve got the private coaching thing   
   and i lined up
this part time retail thing 
  that s great 
  that s good  i got that covered 
i just have this problem
with my attitude 
it s like i have to get to the place where
i appreciate what the game gave me 
and accept and even embrace
the obvious   
   that the time comes
for every athlete when they   
it s never gonna come for me 
you know what 
maybe we shouldn t talk 
maybe we should watch tv
or something 
no  no  no  hold on  come here 
i hear everything you re saying 
come sit over here  i m gonna set you
down and make you something to eat 
we get a little food in your stomach 
we ll both think better 
you like inspirational stories 
okay  i got one for you 
i knew a really good player once 
and the coach cut him 
and the guy just felt   
he felt impotent 
now you re probably feeling whatever
the female version of that word is 
it s the same word 
don t let what s going on with you
make you give me a hard time 
because that s not productive 
i m not 
it s the same word for women 
 impotent  
okay  tie goes to the pretty one 
same word  he was feeling impotent 
just like you may be feeling 
i don t think that s how i feel   
can i finish my thought 
maybe it ll help  maybe it won t 
but i m trying 
i m sorry 
  that s all right 
  go ahead 
okay  so his girlfriend had a cat
and he started to save the cat s shit   
  a little trust 
  okay 
he started to save all the cat s shit 
and every few days or so   
   he d take a little amount and wrap it
in a different package  like a gift   
   or a magazine roll
or something you order online 
every few days for eight months   
   he would send these cat turds
to the guy who cut him 
is that it 
yeah  that s it  it s a great story 
did you understand it was the coach
he sent it to 
to the guy who cut him 
he felt impotent  and then he   
file it away  it worked for this guy 
no  so he stopped
when his anger went away   
yeah  yeah 
well  the cat died 
oh  god 
there  a smile 
that s horrible 
i didn t know the cat was gonna die 
you feel better 
great  i hated seeing you

  intriguing 
  ryan  get loose 
well

  i got a way 
whenever this one thing happens 
i know i m done 
it s personal  i don t want
anyone making fun of me 
no  no one s    go 
i m in love with somebody when
i wear a condom with the other girls 
holy shit  i m in love 
hello 
you up for a crazy idea 
yes 
maybe it d be fun if you
kind of move in with me 
hello  are you there

i told you it was crazy 
can you give me a minute
to form a thought 
  yeah  yeah  take your time 
  okay  thanks 
okay  i ll call you back 
that was quick 
i know  but  lisa  listen 
today i caught myself   
thanks  bobby 
today i caught myself wishing
you were in the bullpen with me 
literally having a daydream 
i mean  that s serious 
li    are you there 
hello  what are you doing 
i think i m thinking 
don t  you shouldn t have to think
about a great idea 
you said this was a crazy idea 
i know  i think it s both  i think part of
the greatness is how crazy it is 
what first popped into your mind 
that i don t know what to say
and it makes me feel stupid 
second thing 
that i ve never lived
with anyone before 
great  no one s had a chance
to ruin you 
have you ever lived with anybody 
with me you get into what does
 living together  mean   
   and duration is a factor 
but listen  is     do you think   
   this is something 
do you wanna do this 
  hello 
  i honestly   
  yeah 
  i don t know how to figure this out 
is there tingling 
do you have goose bumps 
maybe i need to work my voice
a little bit until you get them 
i think i just got them 
what 
  i think i just got them 
  yeah 
i really like you  matty 
okay 
  good phone call 
  good phone call 
  right  yeah 
  thank you 
this is such a mistake 
  overstepping alert 
  you sublet your apartment 
you told me don t do anything halfway
unless you re willing to be half happy 
don t make important life decisions
when you are mush  it s too dangerous 
fight low self esteem 
don t give it the wheel 
i am packed here  i am doing this 
so back off  or do what you always do
for me  pull out some damn positives 
i m sorry  honey 
positives 
hell  the guy has
a 94 mile an hour fastball 
he makes 14 million a year 
go get him 
  got your bag  i cleared some space 
  yeah  i just   
  yeah  come on in 
  okay 
okay  i can get rid of
both of these things right here 
i ll talk to the guys downstairs 
they have storage space 
it s okay 
we ll make it work 
hey  boss  it s me 
  annie 
  hi  did you call that girl 
no  you don t have to bring me food 
it s enough that you found this place 
that was selfish  you dress up
my neighborhood  love your window 
it s great 
this is   
cooking relaxes me when i can t
sleep  so why not just call her 
honestly  because my
first impression wasn t great 
i d rather be more myself
when i see her next 
what if someone beats you to her 
optimism is sanity for me right now 
please  sit down 
make yourself comfortable 
relax 
look 
i m in a funny position   
   but i know stuff about
what happened at work 
i can t tell you
because of that thing i signed   
   but if you start guessing  i can t help
it if this face is an open book  look 
stop  you d get in trouble  and just
listening could be wrongdoing for me 
this information is killing me 
it s like i know someone is gonna
shoot you and i can t scream 
 watch out  that man s gonna
blow your frigging head off  
please play this game with me 
or i ll just tell you 
  no 
  for god s sake  let me unburden 
stop  stop 
annie  sit down  please  sit down 
careful  you have to understand
what this is like for me right now 
picture a very angry ocean  a storm 
and i m on this little tiny boat 
and miraculously 
this boat is still afloat 
and that boat is that
i haven t done anything wrong 
like letting you say something you re
legally constrained from revealing 
not doing anything wrong is
what s keeping me afloat  all right 
if i lose that  i m gone 
don t rock the boat 
  i know about the boat 
  stop 
  it s a terrible boat  get out of the boat 
  respect me on this 
for what it s worth  it doesn t matter 
i think i ve guessed
the same stuff you know 
i think i know what you do 
nope 
you couldn t function if you knew
what i m talking about 
oh  i think i could 
i think i am 
  leave it 
  what if i give you a hint 
no  don t  don t make me
leave my own apartment  please 
okay  eat something 
thank you 
the lasagna looks amazing 
by the way 
  hello  dad 
  are you coming to my place 
  almost there 
  good 
i have some disturbing news 
  what 
  i ll wait till you get here 
tell me  it d be nice to get
one piece of bad news   
   without someone studying me
to see how i take it 
anger can be useful 
watch out for the bitterness 
what s the news  dad 
there are strong indications
that they are going to indict you 
i have canceled
everything i ve got   
   and i am dedicating myself
completely to this 
george 
george 
oh  god  please don t kid me 
how are you 
really   
  good to see you 
  yeah

thanks 
  you didn t have to do that 
  yeah  i did 
so do you live in this building 
did you leave 
are you still here 
yeah  absolutely 
  here i am 
  okay 
sorry i m not more hospitable 
i m in a hurry 
can i go first 
i want to explain why i haven t called 
i don t understand 
i think i ve made a bad assumption that
we ve been on the same wavelength 
that didn t come out right at all 
i didn t mean   
i didn t quite mean to say that either 
you ever wanna delete every sentence
you say  even as you say them 
  no 
  no 
you re funny  you know 
i m really glad i ran into you 
i bit your head off at dinner 
i have this thing about rudeness 
so i m glad i could say i m sorry 
  no

hey  babe 
george  this is my boyfriend  matty 
nice to meet you
