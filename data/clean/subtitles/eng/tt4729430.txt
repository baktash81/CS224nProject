hello
hello
mr klaus i take it
you remember me from the nice
breaking and entering last night
jesper johanssen postman
but we never properly
uh
i uh
you see mr klaus
it seems like word got around
that the poor children of smeerensburg
have started uh
completely unprompted
writing letters asking you for
toys
so i figured
you have the whole barn filled with toys
just sitting there collecting dust so
oh god okay this is it here it goes
oh wow
that is
totally normal
not a symptom of any mental illness
or anything
go away
mr klaus sir
those little children
if you donate your old toys to them
well
ill gladly deliver them for free
mr klaus wait
please
think of all the joy youll bring
their miserable little lives
look here
poor little herlief
he only has sticks and stones
to play with so sad
and this one
little penny patty
her doll was so old
it crumbled in her arms
when she came to me
and then kristoff
little ugly kristoff
this little
tonight same time
great what same time
you mean dead of night
i can just take the toys now
no i go with you
theres no need
for you to come with me really
it might be against the law
for a noncertified postman
to ride with me
i have to check the rule book
great tonight then ill see you then
good talk good talk
whoa whoo
huh
oh oh
playing
playing i tell you
with an ellingboe
an ellingboe no less
in all my years
did you all hear that
unacceptable
i dont know how it happened
i turned away for one second
and then i saw it
i brought her as soon as i could sir
thats just wrong wrong i say
inconceivable
what are we going to do
unthinkable
hmm this is bad very bad
worst ive ever seen really
what were you thinking kid
dont you know that
krums and ellingboes dont mix
but why
why he asks
see what i mean
why
i dont know what to do
please help us miss i beg you
do you know what this is little boy
this is tradition
centuries of glorious hatred
passed down through generations
there was the hundredday brawl of 45
which we totally won
the maritime game of chicken
the great mooning of 86
so if theres something we know
going back as far as we can remember
its that a krum
despises an ellingboe
and an ellingboe cant stand a krum
that is why
now i just know you didnt mean to
disrespect all of that heritage right
right
and it wont happen again
will it
of course not
now tell me all about
where this pretty thing came from
ugh
let me guess
leaving it at the gate not an option

that very same smile on my face

i didnt want to admit it at first either
she used to tease me about it
she
my lydia
i remember when i found
this spot in the woods that she loved
and i built us a house right here
away from it all
but it wasnt gonna be
the two of us for long
we wanted children
lots of them
running around laughing
getting in trouble
while we waited
i started making toys for them
and we waited
and i kept making toys and more toys
oh heres another one what do you think
and we kept waiting
but they never came
and then
she got sick
even now sometimes
it almost feels like shes still
after after she was gone
i i guess i got lost
she loved birds
so i just kept making birdhouses
but then
then you showed up
delivering these toys
seeing the joy they bring to children
i thought id never feel this again
and i have you to thank for it my friend

dad you cant just show up and
wait what 14000
thats not right it
oh but it is
dont be so modest
whatre they doing here
they were the ones who alerted me
to what youve accomplished here
we couldnt let such a feat go unrewarded
listen whatever they told you
well then ready to go
go where
home of course
a deals a deal the ordeal is over
home
with the personal butler
and the breakfast in bed and
my silk sheets
no one deserves it more
wouldnt you agree mr klaus
oh he was unbelievable
encouraging children to write letters
and go to school
convincing the locals
to donate their labor to
such a worthy cause
indeed
well shall we then
perhaps a minute to say your goodbyes
of course
please i can explain
i was
oh its very clear
you just duped everyone
so you could get back to your
puffedup life back in the big town
something like that
no no well at first maybe yes
but alva please come
alva please come back
if i i didnt get the letters
id be cut off but things changed
jesper
jesper
márgu
klaus just listen i
everybodys out to get something right
i thought
well a bit of hardship
might help straighten you out
but even i must admit that
well lets just say that theres
certainly a bright future
for the man who brought postal service
to smeerensburg thats for sure
and speaking of the future
i look forward to discussing
one down one to go
if you ask me who right now i swear
well now finally leaving arent we
i uh
anchors away captain
were sailing off at once
well thats a first
i beg your pardon
never saw a postman
looking more miserable leaving
than on the day they came in
oh well best leave it alone i say
im sure its nothing that could fester
and eventually become
a source of resentment and regret
jesper
jesper
cheer up little one
i think i may have missed my boat
jesper
so i told him
i told him everything
and then he turned to me and he said
hed never been
more proud of me
and he hugged me can you believe that
i thought hed be mad
well yeah sure ill miss it
the big house the having my every whim
tended to the silk sheets
oh god the silk sheets
can we change the subject
anyways anybody can get off a boat
the real trick is gonna be
convincing klaus and alva to give me an
what whats that
its the clans
klaus
slowly
slowly slowly
a little bit
well well
isnt this convenient
whatre you doing here
why we were just thinking
dont our children
also deserve a present
and lookie here
youve already got her favorite thing
in the world
a nice big piñata
hey you put
one hand on those toys and i swear i
stand back all right
do what you will with the toys
but no one gets hurt
suits us just fine
how long until children
go back to the old ways
once there are no toys to bribe them with
how long until they
turn against each other
and how long until the grownups follow
jesper
the postman
ha eat our snow you
theyre not attached
why arent they attached
i thought they were attached
i would never in a million years
have done what i just did
if i didnt think these were attached
after them
who leaves a sleigh
unattached like aah
destroy those toys
stop them at any cost
mine
mine mine
mine
mine
mine
i could really use a hand here
use interesting choice of word
really youre gonna
go for the guilt trip now
smash those toys to pieces
the toys
we have to close that bag
what do you care
i thought you were leaving
great sure ill tell you what
lets continue discussing
what a horrible person i am
while i most likely break my neck
trying to save the childrens toys
why dont we
get down there
stop those toys
uh klaus
hmm

i wouldnt get knocked off too
never mind dont answer that
mine
whoa

oh no no no no
jesper let go
its not worth it
are you crazy no
see nothing to it just
i wouldnt be so sure

this town was built
on resentment and spite
and itll stay that way
as long as a krum
or an ellingboe
ugh
have something to say about it
lets go were done here
well said
wait does that mean the feud is back on
no more truce

a true act of goodwill

mine
pumpkin

mine
honey sweetie
let go and come back here right now
get down from there
mine
its mama calling
put the boy down
remember mama
you dont know
where hes been
klaus i dont know what to say
if i hadnt
whats this
the presents in the sleigh were all fake
give me a little credit
i wasnt going to let them have the toys
but how did you know that
kids talk you know
and if kids happen to be talking
about their parents plotting to form
an angry mob
then you know teachers listen
it was a simple plan
they would destroy
the decoys and leave
but then you showed up
and made it complicated as usual
so all this was for nothing
oh i wouldnt say that
shall we then
he came he came
yeah
mines the big one
i told you i told you he would come
mom come here quick
yes
yeah
its just what i wanted
he came he came he came
dad mom wake up you have to see this
life went on
and smeerensburg continued
to change for the better
poetic dont you think
as for alva and i
well whatd you expect
of course she loved me
every year come the christmas season
the letters started pouring in
more and more each time
and from farther away
we did have to expand the operation
just like we had planned
more children more toys more towns
its so bright you can even see at night
oh look over there
see the red and yellow along the rim
the years went by
any chance for a hot cup of coffee
for your neighborhood mailman
what is on your face
what you dont like it
i think it looks good on me dont you
be honest alva hates it
each better than the last
and then on the 12th year
im coming love
i looked for him everywhere
i asked everyone
but we just couldnt find him
no goodbye
no explanation
nothing
it was as if he had just
faded away
all right
ive got two urgent deliveries here
postmaster sir
the letters are getting in the envelope
proceed to stamp the letter
another stamp
signed sealed to be delivered
nighty night kids
go to sleep now
night mom night dad
good night

what happened to him
after that
how why
i cant even begin to comprehend
i stopped trying to
make sense of it a long time ago
what i do know
is that once a year
i get to see my friend
how many nights do you lie awake
in the darkest place
ayah ehoh ehoh
how many days do you share the pain
of your darker days
ayah ehoh ehoh

how many words does it really take
to make a change
ayah ehoh ehoh
mmm mmm
how many fights is it gonna take
to convince what joy could bring
ayah ehoh ehoh
all i know is
if happy lives a mile away
a couple steps is all it takes
if kindness lives in everyone
then all it takes is standing up
cant touch it see it
oh

the greatest things youll ever know
