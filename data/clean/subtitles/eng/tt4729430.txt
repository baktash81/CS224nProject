but i bet there s one you never forget 
send it off to a certain plump guy
in a red suit
and  provided
you ve kept your act together
more or less 
he ll drop off a toy or two 
and yet  no one seems to wonder
how the whole thing
got started in the first place 
this is a story about letters 
and it began   
with this one 
   74  75  76   
   77  78  79 
  80 
  drill sergeant  sir 
all the way from the top 
dispatch for one of your cadets 
it s for him  sir 
cadet johanssen 
mmm mmm mmm

don t tell me  let me try to guess 
i give up  who are you 
sarge 
drill sarge  have a seat 
can i get you something to drink 
an espresso  a cappuccino 
aren t you supposed to be
in equestrian training 
mmm hmm  mmm hmm 
no worries 
i ve got someone covering for me 
dispatch
from the postmaster general s office 
what 
sarge  is that for real 
don t tease me now 
here  hold these 
ah  well  i was expecting this
a little bit sooner 
but  yup  summoned to the dragon s lair 
go ahead and cancel
the drill sergeant s espresso  actually 
and  uh  here  why don t you finish mine 
i m not gonna be needing it anymore   
   and i m gonna take one last look
around the old place so i can forget it 
mmm hmm  got it  all right  let s go 
nine months 
it s been nine months
since i used every ounce of my influence
to get you into the royal postal academy 
actually  nine months and six days 
but who s counting 
what  no croutons 
oh  man  come on 
shall we take account
of your progress then 
mmm hmm  mmm hmm  mmm hmm  definitely 
  sergeant 
  yes  sir 
sorting and filing 
total failure 
carrier pigeon care and handling   
   abysmal performance 
transport of fragile merchandise   
   worst on record 
well  there you have it 
but  hey  we gave it the old college try 
didn t we 
guess i ll just go pack up
and head home then  too bad 
darn  oh  darn 
  stay right where you are 
  no  dad 
you re right  when will i grow up 
when will i stop squandering
all these opportunities 
which you so kindly forced me into 
and become my own man 
i guess i must really hanker down
and rethink my priorities 
all wrapped up in my silk sheets
with some caviar and a sherry   
you still buy the same brand  right 
you think i m just going to
watch you purposely fail
and then let you waltz right back
to a privileged life
void of any purpose or meaning 
well  yeah  where else would i

he s a good guy    deep down 
hello 
hello 
mr    klaus  i take it 
you remember me from the nice
breaking and entering last night 
jesper johanssen  postman 
but we never properly   
uh   
i  uh   
you see  mr  klaus 
it seems like word got around
that the poor children of smeerensburg
have started  uh   
completely unprompted   
writing letters asking you for   
toys 
so i figured
you have the whole barn filled with toys
just sitting there collecting dust  so   
oh  god  okay  this is it  here it goes 
oh  wow 
that is   
totally normal 
not a symptom of any mental illness
or anything 
  go away 
  mr  klaus  sir 
those little children   
   if you donate your old toys to them   
   well 
i ll gladly deliver them for free 
mr  klaus  wait 
please 
think of all the joy you ll bring
their miserable little lives 
look  here 
poor little herlief 
he only has sticks and stones
to play with  so sad 
and this one 
little penny    patty 
her doll was so old 
it crumbled in her arms
when she came to me 
and then kristoff   
little  ugly kristoff 
this little   
tonight  same time 
great  what   same time  
you mean  dead of night 
  i can just take the toys now 
  no  i go with you 
there s no need
for you to come with me  really 
it might be against the law
for a noncertified postman
to ride with me 
i have to check the rule book 
great  tonight  then  i ll see you then 
good talk  good talk 
whoa  whoo 
huh 
oh  oh 
playing 
playing  i tell you 
with an ellingboe 
  an ellingboe  no less 
  in all my years 
  did you all hear that 
  unacceptable 
i don t know how it happened 
i turned away for one second   
and then i saw it 
i brought her as soon as i could  sir 
  that s just wrong  wrong  i say 
  inconceivable 
  what are we going to do 
  unthinkable 
hmm  this is bad  very bad 
worst i ve ever seen  really 
what were you thinking  kid 
don t you know that   
krums and ellingboes don t mix 
  but why 
   why   he asks 
  see what i mean 
  why 
i don t know what to do 
please help us  miss  i beg you 
do you know what this is  little boy 
this is tradition 
centuries of glorious hatred 
passed down through generations 
there was the hundred day brawl of  45 
which we totally won 
the maritime game of chicken 
the great mooning of  86 
so  if there s something we know   
   going back as far as we can remember   
   it s that a krum
despises an ellingboe   
   and an ellingboe can t stand a krum 
that is why 
now  i just know you didn t mean to
disrespect all of that heritage  right 
  right 
  and it won t happen again 
will it 
of course not 
now  tell me all about
where this pretty thing came from 
ugh 
let me guess 
leaving it at the gate not an option 
you really have a way with words 
you know 
of course  you don t   
of course  don t even answer that   
i m sorry  i m sorry  i m sorry 
whoa  whoa  whoa  no  no  no

  oh  
  but you can always feel it  
  oh  
  the greatest things you ll ever know  
  are invisible  
huh 
  klaus  i   
  uh 
  if happy lives a mile away

looks like someone
might need help mailing letters 
yeah 
  who 
  i  i   
i mean   
how have we never defeated you 
yeah  then   
when she got on the sled 
i thought   oh  no  we made it too small  
but no  it was just right for her size 
and she loved it  right 
i think she did 
do you think she loved it 
  i do 
  yeah 
me too  me too  yeah  she loved it 
you know  i remember the day i first had
that very same smile on my face 
what  what smile  i wasn t smiling 
i was squinting  from the sun 
right 
i didn t want to admit it at first either 
she used to tease me about it 
 she  
my lydia 
i remember when i found
this spot in the woods that she loved 
and i built us a house right here 
away from it all 
but it wasn t gonna be
the two of us for long 
we wanted children 
lots of them 
running around  laughing 
getting in trouble 
while we waited 
i started making toys for them 
and we waited 
and i kept making toys and more toys 
oh  here s another one  what do you think 
and we kept waiting 
but they never came   
and then   
she got sick 
even now    sometimes   
it almost feels like she s still   
after    after she was gone 
i    i guess i got lost 
she loved birds 
so i just kept making birdhouses 
but then   
then you showed up 
delivering these toys 
seeing the joy they bring to children 
i thought i d never feel this again 
and i have you to thank for it  my friend 
so    thank you 
of course 
  hey  you know what  we re doing it 
  what 
  doing what 
  the christmas thing 
we re making all those toys 
  that s what she would ve wanted 
  really 
yeah  really 
and with a whole year of planning 
  we can expand to more villages next year 
  next year 
  and more the year after that 
  but i won t   
i mean  who knows
what s gonna happen next year 
i might not even   
what re you going on about 
let s go  no time to lose 
i might not even be here 
  one  two  three  four  five  
  once i caught a fish alive  
  six  seven  eight  nine  ten  
  then i let it go again  
  why did you let it go   
  because it bit my finger so   
  which finger did it bite   
  this little finger on my right   
  good job 
  yay 
all right  that s it for today 
and  um    homework 
oh  uh    i forgot about homework 
you know what  no homework 
am i the best teacher ever or what 
what   
  happened here 
  oh 
yeah  i thought
i would give the place an update 
everybody knows rotting fish is so over 
how did you pay for this 
hmm 
  your savings 
  well  not all of it 
actually  yeah  all of it 
but check it out 
i think it looks pretty good 
what about starting
far  far away from here 
where s that alva 
someone would have to be pretty stupid
to want to leave this place now 
don t you think 
i    guess 
you guess  oh  wow 
you have no idea what you ve done  do you 
ugh  come on  i ll show you

good evening  postman johanssen 
  hello 
  miss  alva 
not quite the same place 
is it 
hey 
what re you doing here 
a true act of goodwill  huh 
always sparks another 
never fails 
remember  put the letter in the envelope 
  and pass it down the line 
  come on  it doesn t have to rhyme 
  that s right  keep at it 
  keep it short and sweet 
no extra points for good spelling 
  oh  you re doing so great  pumpkin 
  let s go  one letter 
come on 
it doesn t have to be shakespeare  people 
whoa 
steady  ol  girl  easy does it 
oh  wow 
uh huh  smooth lines  good  nice work 
hello 
hi 
what am i supposed to do  huh 
stay forever in this little town 
hanging out with an old woodsman 
surrounded by crazy people 
never wanting anything more 
okay  are you gonna do that part or   
how about you finish these and   
whoa 
they insisted 
and i didn t want to be rude 
i don t know    what do you   
pfft  it s a lot of red 
what do you    is it too much 
no 
we ll just blindfold the reindeer
so they don t get dizzy 
  that s all  i m kidding 
  aw   
i m kidding  i m kidding 
it looks great  it looks good 
it s nice  it s   
hello  jesper 
dad  what 
sorry 
let s  um    let s talk outside 
it s a little cramped in here 
dad  what re you doing here 
time isn t up yet 
i ve still got a few days until   
fourteen thousand letters
out of smeerensburg 
well  i had to come and see it for myself 
dad  you can t just show up and   
wait  what  14 000 
  that s not right  it   
  oh  but it is 
don t be so modest 
what re they doing here 
they were the ones who alerted me
to what you ve accomplished here 
we couldn t let such a feat go unrewarded 
listen  whatever they told you   
well  then  ready to go 
go  where 
home  of course 
a deal s a deal  the ordeal is over 
home 
with the personal butler
and the breakfast in bed and   
my silk sheets 
no one deserves it more 
wouldn t you agree  mr  klaus 
oh  he was unbelievable 
encouraging children to write letters
and go to school 
convincing the locals
to donate their labor to   
such a worthy cause 
indeed 
well  shall we then 
perhaps a minute to say your goodbyes 
of course 
please  i can explain 
  i was   
  oh  it s very clear 
you just duped everyone
so you could get back to your
puffed up life back in the big town 
something like that 
no  no  well  at first maybe  yes 
but  alva  please come   
alva  please come back 
if i  i didn t get the letters 
i d be cut off  but things changed 
jesper 
  jesper 
  márgu   
klaus  just listen  i   
everybody s out to get something  right 
i thought   
well  a bit of hardship
might help straighten you out 
but even i must admit that   
well  let s just say that there s
certainly a bright future
for the man who brought postal service
to smeerensburg  that s for sure 
and speaking of the future 
i look forward to discussing   
one down  one to go 
if you ask me  who  right now  i swear 
well  now  finally leaving  aren t we 
i    uh   
anchors away  captain 
  we re sailing off at once 
  well  that s a first 
i beg your pardon 
never saw a postman
looking more miserable leaving
than on the day they came in 
oh  well  best leave it alone  i say 
i m sure it s nothing that could fester
and eventually become
a source of resentment and regret 
jesper 
jesper 
cheer up  little one 
i think i may have missed my boat 
jesper 
so i told him 
i told him everything 
and then he turned to me  and he said   
   he d never been
more proud of me 
and he hugged me  can you believe that 
i thought he d be mad 
well  yeah  sure  i ll miss it 
the big house  the having my every whim
tended to  the silk sheets 
oh  god  the silk sheets 
can we change the subject 
anyways  anybody can get off a boat 
the real trick is gonna be
convincing klaus and alva to give me an   
what  what s that 
it s the clans 
klaus 
slowly 
slowly  slowly 
a little bit   
well  well 
isn t this convenient 
what re you doing here 
why  we were just thinking 
 don t our children
also deserve a present  
and lookie here 
you ve already got her favorite thing
in the world 
a nice  big piñata 
hey  you put   
   one hand on those toys and i swear i   
stand back  all right 
do what you will with the toys 
but no one gets hurt 
suits us just fine 
how long until children
go back to the old ways
once there are no toys to bribe them with 
how long until they
turn against each other 
and how long until the grown ups follow 
jesper 
the postman 
ha  eat our snow  you   
they re not attached 
why aren t they attached 
i thought they were attached 
i would never  in a million years 
have done what i just did
if i didn t think these were attached 
after them 
who leaves a sleigh
unattached like    aah 
destroy those toys 
  stop them at any cost 
  mine 
mine  mine 
mine 
mine   
mine 
i could really use a hand here 
 use   interesting choice of word 
really  you re gonna
go for the guilt trip now 
smash those toys to pieces 
the toys 
  we have to close that bag 
  what do you care 
  i thought you were leaving 
  great  sure  i ll tell you what 
let s continue discussing
what a horrible person i am
while i most likely break my neck
trying to save the children s toys 
  why don t we 
  get down there 
stop those toys 
uh    klaus 
hmm 
nice move  how d you know
i wouldn t get knocked off too 
never mind  don t answer that 
  mine 
  whoa 
go  go  we re dead 
we re dead  we re dead 
mine 
mine 
pumpkin 
i m still proud of you  you hear me 
mine 
we re losing toys 
oh  no 
  stop  stop 
  oh  my goodness 
oh  no  no  no  no 
jesper  let go 
  it s not worth it 
  are you crazy  no 
see  nothing to it  just   
i wouldn t be so sure 
wait  no  no  no 
no  no  no  no  no 
this town was built
on resentment and spite 
and it ll stay that way
as long as a krum   
or an ellingboe 
ugh 
   have something to say about it 
let s go  we re done here 
well said 
wait  does that mean the feud is back on 
no more truce 
first thing tomorrow 
a true act of goodwill 
what was that 
a true act of goodwill   
always sparks another 
i think you hit your head
pretty hard  dear 
you should lie back down 
you don t believe me  turn around 
what 
turn around 
mine 
  pumpkin 
  honey 
  drop that immediately 
  mine 
  honey  sweetie 
  let go and come back here right now 
  get down from there 
  mine 
it s mama calling 
  put the boy down 
  remember mama 
you don t know
where he s been 
klaus  i don t know what to say 
if i hadn t   
what s this 
the presents in the sleigh were all fake 
give me a little credit 
i wasn t going to let them have the toys 
  but how did you know that   
  kids talk  you know 
and if kids happen to be talking
about their parents plotting to form
an angry mob 
then  you know  teachers listen 
it was a simple plan 
they would destroy
the decoys and leave 
but then you showed up
and made it complicated  as usual 
so  all this was for nothing 
oh  i wouldn t say that 
shall we then 
he came  he came 
  yeah 
  mine s the big one 
i told you  i told you he would come 
mom  come here  quick 
  yes 
  yeah 
  it s just what i wanted 
  he came  he came  he came 
dad  mom  wake up  you have to see this 
life went on 
and smeerensburg continued
to change for the better 
poetic  don t you think 
as for alva and i   
well  what d you expect 
of course she loved me 
every year  come the christmas season 
the letters started pouring in 
more and more each time 
and from farther away 
we did have to expand the operation 
just like we had planned 
more children  more toys  more towns 
it s so bright you can even see at night 
oh  look over there 
see the red and yellow along the rim 
the years went by 
any chance for a hot cup of coffee
for your neighborhood mailman 
what is on your face 
what  you don t like it 
i think it looks good on me  don t you 
be honest  alva hates it 
each better than the last 
and then  on the 12th year   
i m coming  love 
i looked for him everywhere 
i asked everyone 
but we just couldn t find him 
no goodbye 
no explanation 
nothing 
it was as if he had just   
faded away 
all right 
i ve got two urgent deliveries here 
postmaster  sir

proceed to stamp the letter 
another stamp 
signed  sealed  to be delivered 
  nighty night  kids

to convince what joy could bring
