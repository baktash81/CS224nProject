well look ive got
four yes i know
all for trying to save peoples lives
its a disgrace
well you know why they sue us
i have a very busy day

only because youre my friend
im your doctor

hows it feel
not so bad
these clay are the facts
when i open up your chest

it is a very real possibility that you will die
right here on this table
and if the transplant is successful
there is a 50 chance
that youll be dead in 10 years
the clocks ticking
so its tough love today huh
you think this is a joke
look at that

thats surgical steel
a hundredth of an inch thick
that thing will slice through you

i need you to be prepared
you get your house
in order just in case
tell your mother marry the girl
and live your life
you might not have much of it left
okay
jack

wait i thought we didnt
have anything until later
no riordans cabbage
from this morning
hes in the icu bleeding
he took off for
the fucking vineyard
so uh hey clay
how about letting us
have all your money
so that we could retire
you wouldnt mind
doing that would you
no you know me
go ahead take it all
what a guy
remember what i said clay
no regrets
jack
the clocks ticking
jack what are you doing
lets go
lets go jack
come on
promise me youll kiss me all over
well ive got a big
halloween party tonight
but how about
i sneak out afterward
whats wrong with right now
well i cant im
i know its daylight
and all but i missed you
you look beautiful sam
i do
yeah you do
i should tell you that more often
whats wrong
im sorry
i didnt know she was going
to be here all right
if i turn around shell see
this is getting boring clay
uhhuh
were going to have to
discuss this merger later
i feel sick
youre not supposed
to make me feel sick
thought youd run off and left me
you remember dr neyer
dont you
hello clayton
good to see you again
weve already been through this
dr harpers my surgeon
ive already told you
i know but jonathan
leads the field remember
yeah well like i said before
i have a surgeon
now i know hes been
on the donor list for a year lilith
but thats completely
normal for his type
onegatives like you and your son
always wait a little longer
it just means
youre special thats all
excuse me
i dont think youre listening
to what im saying
although since he has
a cardiomyopathy
of undetermined etiology
hey
im sitting right here
you want to talk
about me talk to me
clay
its fine lilith
you and dr harper
have obviously become friends
he was on call when you had
your first attack
he saved your life
i get the attachment really i do
but your mother and i
have been friends for 15 years
my hands have been
inside presidents
dont you think i might at least
deserve the time of day
you want to be operated on
by the best surgeon possible
dont you clay
good
now lets talk about the party tonight
no no no no
no no no no
now see that is where
youre wrong
i just dont see
the growth in leadership
thats why this whole
beresford capital business
scares me so much
now look are my numbers
wrong here
because if the shimotomo merger
does not go through soon
then that entire firm is in a lot of trouble
that doesnt matter
look im telling you
beresford better stay away from shimotomo
theyre going to smile at your face
and then theyre going
to stab you in the back
these guys are dangerous
trust me ive seen them do it
anybody who gets
into business with them
is really asking for trouble
clay beresford better know
what hes doing
sir they need you out there
thank you
welcome
my daughter tanya and my wife
happy halloween
oh here he is
whiz kid of wall street
barrons man of the year at 22
clayton beresford jr
sir id like you to meet
mr inamoto and mr waturi
theyre with our friends
at shimotomo
theyre here to check up on you
they know about your condition
mr waturi would like for you to know
how much respect he had
for your father
mr beresford
he was quite a businessman
yes he was arigato
mr waturi would also like to know
how youre feeling today
well youll have to tell mr waturi
that i feel fabulous
please also tell him that im ready
to cut to the chase
whenever he is
in the last eight quarters alone
we bought and nurtured
over 600 companies
we donate 80 million
charitable dollars per annum
we provide over 16000 jobs
mr waturi my heart may be weak
but my mind is strong
and the only thing
you need to worry about
is which one of our 17 niigata sakes
youd like to enjoy with your dinner
youre a ridiculous person
you know that
i dont know how you say that
with a straight face
i mean its just its ridiculous
im serious this time
lets just leave
the country you know
go to china
try our luck on the black market
why dont we just go outside
well grab some random
person off the street
drag them in here you know
sounds good to me
drag them in and cut them open
hey whatever it takes right
you worry too much
you know that
oh
theyll find me one
it just takes a little time thats all
youre not going to like this
straight to the king
oh nice hand
boat jacks over eights
are you kidding me again
come on youre my son
cant hide anything
from your mother
i think i need to go upstairs
dont stay up too late
beresford capital
opened higher today
after their announcement of the dirasonic
acquisition over the weekend
this bodes well for
the new yorkbased company
especially since continued merger
discussions
with the shimotomo corporation
have left investors feeling anxious
the japanese governments investigation
into the shimotomo familys
alleged links to organized crime
were welldocumented last quarter
and with that merger still in question
the dirasonic acquisition will go a great way
to calming investors concerns
that beresford is playing with fire
still rumors surrounding
the merger
i thought you might like a little drink
oh maybe one thank you
youre up late
something on your mind
got to get my family time in now
you know before some
smoothy whisks you away
yeah right
like thats going to happen
i dont know
i think maybe somebody
had a little baby crush on dr neyer
i saw the way
you were looking at him
i dont need anyone else
i got you clay remember
so i closed lambert today
that means if we get
a hold of mecter too
thats 2000 new jobs guaranteed
plus new housing
do you remember him clay
i remember bits
like what
he died at christmas
come on dont you
remember anything else
sure he was wearing a santa suit
and he fell down the stairs
i mean from when he was alive clay
i remember he smiled a lot
sorry to interrupt mrs beresford
uh door was open
what
i just need your signature
i know its late
but i want to get this out tonight
of course sam

at 632 this morning
on thursday the first of november
clayton beresford jr
died on my operating table
two and a half hours later
his life was saved
there are no excuses for what we did
theres no defense
no one to blame but us
we got what we deserved
clay would have his revenge
and justice would finally be served
for despite all the secrets
despite all the lies and a
a terrible loss
only thing really matters now
he is awake
