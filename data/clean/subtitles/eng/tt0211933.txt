we have to close this merger 
is this about your old man 
is it about him 
jesus  i m not going through this again  jack

want you to tell her 
no  my father would want me
to stop fishing
in the middle of the day
and go back to work  all right 
if he knew what i was doing
with sam  he d disown me 
lying to my mom like this 
he d throw me in the fucking river 
i want you to
take a good look around you  clay 
you own half of this city 
you re creating jobs

my dad s feet were four sizes bigger
than mine  jack 
i can t even fill his socks 
look  i got the rings  didn t i 
i got the license 
no  no  no  no

you don t know my mother

bullshit malpractice lawsuits
there are in this country 
i mean  a hard working
doctor is trying   
are we going to go
through this again  jack 
  well  look  i ve got   
  four  yes  i know 
all for trying to save people s lives 
it s a disgrace 
well  you know why they sue us 
i have a very busy day 
please 
it s because they don t know
what to do with their grief 
it s because people
need someone to blame 
it s because of patients like you
who cannot accept the facts 
come on in 
get acquainted  lie down 
only because you re my friend 
i m your doctor 
get comfortable 
how s it feel 
not so bad 
these  clay  are the facts 
when i open up your chest
and remove your heart 
it is a very real possibility that you will die
right here on this table 
and if the transplant is successful 
there is a 50  chance
that you ll be dead in 10 years 
the clock s ticking 
so it s tough love today  huh 
you think this is a joke 
look at that 
hold it 
that s surgical steel 
a hundredth of an inch thick 
that thing will slice through you
as if you weren t even there 
picture it  clay 
picture the incision 
imagine what it will be like 
i need you to be ready 
i need you to be prepared 
you get your house
in order  just in case 
tell your mother  marry the girl 
and live your life 
you might not have much of it left 
okay 
jack   
saddle up 
wait  i thought we didn t
have anything until later 
no  riordan s cabbage
from this morning 
he s in the icu bleeding 
he took off for
the fucking vineyard 
so  uh    hey  clay 
how about letting us
have all your money
so that we could retire 
you wouldn t mind
doing that  would you 
no  you know me 
go ahead  take it all 
what a guy 
remember what i said  clay 
no regrets 
jack 
the clock s ticking 
jack  what are you doing 
let s go 
let s go  jack 
come on 
promise me you ll kiss me all over 
well  i ve got a big
halloween party tonight 
but how about
i sneak out afterward 
what s wrong with right now 
well  i can t  i m   
i know it s daylight
and all  but i missed you 
you look beautiful  sam 
i do 
yeah  you do 
i should tell you that more often 
what s wrong 
i m sorry 
i didn t know she was going
to be here  all right 
if i turn around  she ll see 
this is getting boring  clay 
uh huh 
we re going to have to
discuss this merger later 
i feel sick 
you re not supposed
to make me feel sick 
thought you d run off and left me 
you remember dr  neyer 
don t you 
hello  clayton 
good to see you again 
we ve already been through this 
dr  harper s my surgeon 
i ve already told you   
i know  but jonathan
leads the field  remember 
yeah  well  like i said before 
i have a surgeon 
now  i know he s been
on the donor list for a year  lilith 
but that s completely
normal for his type 
o negatives like you and your son
always wait a little longer 
it just means
you re special  that s all 
excuse me 
i don t think you re listening
to what i m saying   
although  since he has
a cardiomyopathy
of undetermined etiology   
hey 
i m sitting right here 
you want to talk
about me  talk to me 
  clay 
  it s fine  lilith 
you and dr  harper
have obviously become friends 
he was on call when you had
your first attack 
he saved your life 
i get the attachment  really  i do 
but your mother and i
have been friends for 15 years 
my hands have been
inside presidents 
don t you think i might at least
deserve the time of day 
you want to be operated on
by the best surgeon possible 
don t you  clay 
good 
now let s talk about the party tonight 
no  no  no  no 
no  no  no  no 
now see  that is where
you re wrong 
i just don t see
the growth in leadership 
that s why this whole
beresford capital business
scares me so much 
now look  are my numbers
wrong here 
because if the shimotomo merger
does not go through soon 
then that entire firm is in a lot of trouble 
that doesn t matter 
look  i m telling you 
beresford better stay away from shimotomo 
they re going to smile at your face 
and then they re going
to stab you in the back 
these guys are dangerous 
trust me  i ve seen them do it 
anybody who gets
into business with them
is really asking for trouble 
clay beresford better know
what he s doing   
sir  they need you out there 
thank you 
welcome 
my daughter tanya and my wife 
happy halloween 
oh  here he is 
whiz kid of wall street 
barron s man of the year at 22 
clayton beresford  jr 
sir  i d like you to meet
mr  inamoto and mr  waturi 
they re with our friends
at shimotomo 
they re here to check up on you 
they know about your condition 
mr  waturi would like for you to know
how much respect he had
for your father 
mr  beresford 
he was quite a businessman 
yes  he was  arigato 
mr  waturi would also like to know
how you re feeling today 
well  you ll have to tell mr  waturi
that i feel fabulous 
please also tell him that i m ready
to cut to the chase
whenever he is 
in the last eight quarters alone 
we bought and nurtured
over 600 companies 
we donate 80 million
charitable dollars per annum 
we provide over 16 000 jobs 
mr  waturi  my heart may be weak 
but my mind is strong 
and the only thing
you need to worry about
is which one of our 17 niigata sakes
you d like to enjoy with your dinner 
you re a ridiculous person 
you know that 
i don t know how you say that
with a straight face 
i mean  it s just    it s ridiculous 
i m serious this time 
let s just leave
the country  you know 
go to china 
try our luck on the black market 
why don t we just go outside 
we ll grab some random
person off the street 
drag them in here  you know   
sounds good to me 
drag them in and cut them open 
hey  whatever it takes  right 
you worry too much 
you know that 
oh 
they ll find me one 
it just takes a little time  that s all 
you re not going to like this 
straight to the king 
oh  nice hand 
boat  jacks over eights 
are you kidding me  again 
come on  you re my son 
can t hide anything
from your mother 
i think i need to go upstairs 
don t stay up too late 
beresford capital
opened higher today
after their announcement of the dirasonic
acquisition over the weekend 
this bodes well for
the new york based company 
especially since continued merger
discussions
with the shimotomo corporation
have left investors feeling anxious 
the japanese government s investigation
into the shimotomo family s
alleged links to organized crime
were well documented last quarter 
and with that merger still in question 
the dirasonic acquisition will go a great way
to calming investors  concerns
that beresford is playing with fire 
still  rumors surrounding
the merger   
i thought you might like a little drink 
oh  maybe one  thank you 
you re up late 
something on your mind 
got to get my family time in now 
you know  before some
smoothy whisks you away 
yeah  right 
like that s going to happen 
i don t know 
i think maybe somebody
had a little baby crush on dr  neyer 
i saw the way
you were looking at him 
i don t need anyone else 
i got you  clay  remember 
so  i closed lambert today 
that means if we get
a hold of mecter too 
that s 2 000 new jobs guaranteed 
plus new housing   
do you remember him  clay 
i remember bits 
like what 
he died at christmas 
come on  don t you
remember anything else 
sure  he was wearing a santa suit 
and he fell down the stairs 
i mean from when he was alive  clay 
i remember he smiled a lot 
sorry to interrupt  mrs  beresford 
uh  door was open 
what 
i just need your signature 
i know it s late 
but i want to get this out tonight
