the side of the road
ncic

step out of the vehicle
mr patterson
okay coming out of the
vehicle for handsfree
that seems just
a little bit excessive
mr patterson
youre under arrest
under arrest
you have the right
to remain silent
hey wait a second
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law
the arresting officer ran
your license through the ncic
you were booked for felony assault
2 weeks ago in florida
what no i wasnt
what are you talking about
ive never even been to florida
youve never been to florida
no sir this whole morning
well hang on a second
was it winter park florida
see thats good
were dropping the whole
theres been a mistake thing
i got it now listen
the problem is
mr patterson
is that you missed your court
date 3 days ago in florida
officer let me just explain
and the judge has issued a
warrant for your arrest
yeah
so what were gonna do
is were gonna go ahead and
ship you back down to florida
you can work on your tan
sir yeah listen
youre not listening
sit down
sorry
theres a person
that has my same name
that is doing
things in florida
this guy is making salon appointments
hes buying beach equipment
hes maxing out my credit card
are you sandy bigelow
patterson born may 18th 1974
that is you correct
yeah but its not
me doing this stuff
ive never even been to the state
im here with you guys
im in colorado
how can i be in florida
call winter park pd
pull the mug shot
okay uncuff him
uncuff me thats great
can i see
whoa
is that a woman
if i had to guess its the
woman that stole your identity
obviously taking advantage of the
fact that you have a female name
oh its not female
its unisex
when you say stole my identity
do you mean credit card fraud
oh no no its a lot
worse than that
see what happens is
they get a hold of
your name your birthday
social security
and then they run up debt
get arrested
commit crimes as you
what do you do now you
go down you go get her
oh no we dont go get anyone
let me walk you out
see were denver pd all we
do is open and close the case
now if she buys
something on amazon
then seattle pd
would investigate
your mobile companys in ohio
then cleveland pd handles that
then so on and so forth
for every single theft
well hang on how long
does all this take
about 6 months to a year
a year
yeah so why dont
you go ahead
and just leave your contact
information with this gentleman here
you might want to hold on to this
mug shot in case you may need it
great okay
listen im gonna
need this solved
a whole lot quicker
than a year detective
okay listen i understand that
this is really frustrating for you
but our percentage rate in solving
these cases is pretty high
yeah how many
about 5 to 10 percent
thats garbage

its surprising
cause i
i dont know if youve heard
of the bermuda triangle

once you go in its real
hard to come back out
you know
because some people
dont want to
some people just get lost
in there emotionally

you know
on or in me
