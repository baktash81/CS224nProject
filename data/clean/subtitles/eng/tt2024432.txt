where s the surf shop 
well  sir  it s in
winter park  florida 
florida  i m in colorado 
you know  so   
  damn it 
  excuse me 
unbelievable  i gotta call you back 
driver 
sorry 
pull the vehicle to
the side of the road 
ncic
says 10 29f  use caution 
step out of the vehicle 
mr  patterson 
okay  coming out of the
vehicle for hands free 
that seems just
a little bit excessive 
mr  patterson 
you re under arrest 
under arrest 
you have the right
to remain silent 
hey  wait a second 
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law 
the arresting officer ran
your license through the ncic 
you were booked for felony assault
2 weeks ago in florida 
what  no  i wasn t 
what are you talking about 
i ve never even been to florida 
you ve never been to florida 
no  sir  this whole morning   
well  hang on a second 
was it winter park  florida 
see  that s good 
we re dropping the whole
 there s been a mistake  thing 
i got it now  listen   
the problem is 
mr  patterson 
is that you missed your court
date 3 days ago in florida 
officer  let me just explain 
and the judge has issued a
warrant for your arrest 
yeah   
so what we re gonna do
is we re gonna go ahead and
ship you back down to florida 
you can work on your tan 
sir  yeah  listen 
you re not listening 
sit down 
sorry 
there s a person
that has my same name
that is doing
things in florida 
this guy is making salon appointments 
he s buying beach equipment 
he s maxing out my credit card 
are you sandy bigelow
patterson  born may 18th  1974 
that is you  correct 
yeah  but it s not
me doing this stuff 
i ve never even been to the state 
i m here with you guys 
i m in colorado 
how can i be in florida 
call winter park pd 
pull the mug shot 
okay  uncuff him 
uncuff me  that s great 
can i see 
whoa 
is that a woman 
if i had to guess  it s the
woman that stole your identity 
obviously taking advantage of the
fact that you have a female name 
oh  it s not female 
it s unisex 
when you say  stole my identity  
do you mean credit card fraud 
oh  no  no  it s a lot
worse than that 
see  what happens is 
they get a hold of
your name  your birthday 
social security 
and then they run up debt 
get arrested 
commit crimes as you 
what do you do now  you
go down  you go get her 
oh  no  we don t go get anyone 
let me walk you out 
see  we re denver pd  all we
do is open and close the case 
now  if she buys
something on amazon 
then seattle pd
would investigate 
your mobile company s in ohio 
then cleveland pd handles that 
then so on and so forth
for every single theft 
well  hang on  how long
does all this take 
about 6 months to a year 
a year 
yeah  so why don t
you go ahead
and just leave your contact
information with this gentleman here 
you might want to hold on to this
mug shot in case you may need it 
great  okay 
listen  i m gonna
need this solved
a whole lot quicker
than a year  detective 
okay  listen  i understand that
this is really frustrating for you 
but our percentage rate in solving
these cases is pretty high 
yeah  how many 
about 5 to 10 percent 
that s garbage 
we ll be in touch
with you  sandy 
patterson 
sorry 
i had a hell of a morning 
listen to this 
can you explain this to me 
what do you got 
these are emails i received from
a couple of prospective clients

6 credit cards 
no  i didn t  actually 
you did 
no  you have 9
other delinquencies 
this is what my morning s
been all about 
your credit score s a 240 
a 240 
there are homeless people with
better numbers than that  sandy 
dude  you have a warrant
out for your arrest 
this is
a financial institution 
how am i supposed to give you
access to  5 billion in funds 
my identity s been stolen 
i was at the police
station all morning 
don t worry about it  though 
i m gonna get on the phone 
i m going to clean it up 
they can run my credit tomorrow
and it s gonna be fine  okay 
what the fuck is this 
those are cops 
that s my guy 
this is the detective
that s handling my case 
hi  i was just filling my
boss in on our situation 
did you find her  do you
have some good news 
no  i m sorry  we don t
have any good news 
soon after you left  we got
a call from orlando metro 
they just busted a narcotics
dealer named paolo gordon 
your name and your credit
cards turned up in connection
with the investigation 
ah  this   
one of my colleagues spoke to your
former employer  mr  harold cornish 
yeah 
and he said that  in fact 
you are a drug dealer 
that s   
he s a fucking liar 
i ve got a warrant
to search the premises 
for drugs 
oh 
and guns 
this is a waste of time 
i understand 
it s not me  it s the
woman in the picture 
just doing my job 
i need to put that out 
okay 
okay  guys  let s   
okay  we re done 
you can let your
employees back in now 
thank you 
so  no oxy

it s the woman in florida 
yeah 
but until we know for sure
that you didn t do this 
it s an open investigation 
for narcotics 
let me walk you out 
we re gonna have to
talk about our options 
i think we got to let you go 
i know where she is  hey

gonna be tomorrow afternoon 
if i tell you  you can tell the
winter park police department 
they can grab her 
and we re done 
no  no  it doesn t work like that 
why not 
well  they d have to bring her
up on local charges first 
and it would pretty much be about a
year before we get a shot at her 
i mean  she d have to be standing
right here to do you any good 
that s the new
standard of police work 
i mean  the criminal s got to be
standing right in front of you 
have a good day 
hang on  hang on 
if they won t bring her here 
what if i bring her here 
what if  somehow 
i get her here 
and i put her right
in front of you 
she gives you a full statement
and owns up to everything 
then we d be done  wouldn t we 
oh  i wouldn t recommend that 
mr  patterson 
you see  criminals
generally just don t
volunteer confessions
to policemen 
all right  what about this 
what about if i ask
her to talk to you 
because she cost me my job
and i want to get my job back 
and in return 
i don t press any charges 
she doesn t have to worry about me 
there s no cops 
but there are cops 
you re down the hall  you re
listening to a thing  i m wearing   
what 
that s ridiculous 
no  no  no  this sort of thing
tends to work pretty well  right

at ease that nothing happened
between the two of us 
i put it out there 
but he did not pick it up 
and  you know  there s   
it s surprising

i don t know if you ve heard
of the bermuda triangle 
which is kind of in here 
and it s    you know   
once you go in  it s real
hard to come back out 
you know

some people just get lost
in there  emotionally

you know 
on  or in  me

i just thought i d take
advantage of a free ride 
and when i felt
like it  skip out
