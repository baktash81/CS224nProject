an elite group of magic users
the lowly commoners
those without magic
are little more than slaves
izmers young empress savina
wishes equality
and prosperity for all
but the evil mage profion
has other intentions
at last
come damodar
release him
you are mine now
come to me
yes i told you
it could be done
you have the power
of the immortals
you can control dragons
with a dragon army
at my command
i can crush the empress
and control
what is rightfully mine
you dont like that do you
good
i can use every ounce
of your rage
come on
follow me
follow me
i said follow me
what now my lord profion
we shall have to modify
our plans
summon the high council of mages
immediately
theyre about to learn something
of our young empress
that may give them pause
for thought
it will be done
this must be some
twisted magic experiment
gone seriously wrong
why is it every time
something bad happens
you blame the mages
when was the last time
you saw a river catch on fire
you think they care
if anyone got hurt
id love to find a way to give
those mages some payback
ridley the savior
thatll be the day
look ridley
things are the way they are
theres nothing
you can do to change it
you got your haves
and your havenots
we are your gottagets
and right about now
we gotta get paid
the magic school
the what
the magic school
are you crazy
well break
into the magic school
think of what we could get
with the fire
it wont be heavily guarded
think of the challenge snails
think of what
we could find in there
if we pull this off
well be the envy
of every thief in sumdall
trust me
why would the empress
want to disband this council
its a concept
i find difficult to believe
azmath your loyalty
is commendable
but we have all watched
the empress growing up
and we have all
heard her views
on what she considers to be
the injustices of the land
but she is just a young woman
young people speak
from the heart not the mind
in time with our counsel
she will come to understand
why things cannot be changed
maybe so
but is that a risk
you are willing to take
her revolutionary ideas
have already taken root
among the people
in time
her influence will grow
as the months go by
she will learn to master
the powers of her scepter
when she does
i have no doubt
she will use it
to enforce her changes upon us
what do you propose profion
i humbly ask that we vote
to remove the scepter
from the empress control
so that government in izmer
will remain secure
remove the scepter
which lolls above our heads
and destroy the threat
of revolution forever
and if she does not agree
then
her true intentions
will become clear
and then we will be forced
to do whatever we must
to protect the strength
and unity of izmer
what say you
how could he get the council
to turn against me
he plays on the fears
of the others
their fears of change
i know vildan
but the changes i propose
are for the good of the people
all people deserve
to be free and equal
whether commoner or mage
i know this within the depths
of my soul
and if necessary
i would die to make that
the way izmer is run
what can l do to stop profion
you must outsmart him
over the past years
i have been searching
for an ancient artifact
called the rod of savrille
it holds the same powers
as your scepter
with one difference
it controls red dragons
if you could obtain it
you could relinquish
your scepter to the council
and still have protection
against profion
i must have
that rod of savrille
with one wave of it
i will topple her
and bring down that useless
council of idiots with her
what is your wish my lord
pay a visit to the magic school
and see our friend vildan
persuade him to give you
the scroll of which he speaks
and bring it here to me
and damodar
make sure that hes
no longer around
to give our young empress
any more good advice
come my friend
ridley
why it got to be so high
snails let go of me
cant we just rob
the first floor next time
hurry up
why dont we just rob god
while were up here
come on snails
i thought you said
this was going to be easy
no i said it wasnt impossible
thats the same thing
you said
when we robbed
that little halflings house
whod he catch me
whod he beat
from the waist down me
are you going to jump
you going to catch me
im going to catch you
promise
i promise now jump
all right
sorry
i thought l heard something
you did
me hitting the ground
that is a big dragon
now were talking
all right lets get to work
ive already told you marina
the empress cant use
her scepter
of golddragon control
or profion will paint her
as a tyrant to the council
profion must be made
to expose himself to them
damn it i know its here
where is it
it should be right here
are you sure you put it away
in its proper place
im sure
youre sure are you
then why is it filed here
with these volumes on alchemy
it belongs in dracology
where is it
i know ive got it somewhere
ah yes this was it
really marina
you must stop dawdling
the empress only has
three days until the council
forces her to relinquish
her scepter to them
im sorry
thats all right
you must understand
the seriousness of our task
i just feel like l should be
doing something more
than shelving books
i understand marina
but you must learn
to be patient to maintain focus
thats the best help
you can provide just now
i suppose youre right
i never saw a scroll
so hard to decode
its protected
by very ancient magic
marina
fetch me some manticore wing
what is that
a dragon tooth
put it back
just a dragon tooth
put it back
a gold dragon tooth
its too big put it back
come on ridley
here
whatd you give me
the rodent for
pick it up come on
you already got enough of these
at your house
look at this
were going to be rich
you know how much
we could get for one of these
dont touch that
one of the lab creatures
must have got loose again
marina check on it
right
snails relax
its an illusion
i knew that
dont touch anything else
all right
what are you doing
were the
the cleaning crew
right
this is dirty
cleanup crews more like it
youre thieves trying to rob us
she mustve put a holding spell
on us with that bracelet
it must be the only way she can
get guys to come home with her
id have to put a feeblemind
spell on myself
to want to take you home
that was funny
youre going
to the city dungeon
that wasnt
what a relief
ill be thanking you
when they cut my head off
you should
itd be an improvement
theres that superior
intelligence
you mages are so famous for
yes well
speaking of intelligence
what kind of genius
would break into a magic school
hed have to be
really stupid or
or what
well
master
lf you dont tell me
which scroll it is
ill have to kill you painfully
never
are you crazy
you just zapped
the chief
of the crimson brigade
to the streets of sumdall
follow them you fools
where are we going
hey nice trick
no the other way
watch out
lady please stop and listen
escapes are
our bread and butter
whats that
i dont know
get this rope off
so i can deal with it
cant nobody get a moment
of peace around here
i ought to
nice lid
you shouldnt have done that
check that door
its locked its locked
follow me
if you think im going
in that filthy mess
thats disgusting
post brigades at every
sewer entrance and exit
i want them found
now
marina of pretensa
student mage
is sought for the brutal murder
of vildan vildir
a reward will be
i cant believe this
you better believe it
theyre framing us
theyre framing you
youre nothing but a thief
they cant be framing me
im an aristocrat im a mage
a lowlevel mage
completely expendable
practically worthless
this is ridiculous
ill go to the authorities
i cant go to the authorities
thats right
theyll toss you in prison
and torture you
till you confess
you better tell us
cause like the man said
were your accomplices
all right
come on
you allow
a slip of a girl
to escape you
with the scroll
and now norda
the empress finest tracker
is in pursuit
and you tell me
not to concern myself
it was a mistake
it will not happen again
there you are right
and heres why
just a friend im sending along
for the ride
a gentle reminder
not to make any more mistakes
the moment you deliver me
the rod
ill ensure that he
it
vacate the premises
now
may l suggest
that once you two have become
fully acquainted
you follow the empress
tracker norda
she happens to be good
at her job
she will lead you
to our missing friends
and the scroll
and this time damodar
dont fail me
its about time
if we find the rod the empress
heaps us with gold huh
why dont you try and rise above
being a dwarf
this isnt about gold
its about saving our empire
empire
who cares about the empire
you mages are the only ones
who benefit from it
oh really thats
an interesting sentiment
coming from a guy
who steals things for a living
have you ever heard
of honor amongst thieves
we might live outside the law
but we respect each other
unlike a bunch
of backstabbing mages
that is just the sort of
halfbaked illiterate drivel
that proves commoners
really are common
thats it were out of here
come on snails
well go into hiding
she can find the rod herself
fine
i thought you were leaving
mind if we eat first
no be my guest
those red marks there
look like the locks
my father used to put on plans
in his carriages
please
this is an ancient scroll
not a blueprint for a bucket
you dont seem to know
what youre doing
so you might as well let me
have a look
give that back
lets see he used to put
his fingers like this
and then hed say
something like
alanor salah
what was that word
bidet
bidet bidara bidara
alanor salah bidara
cant blame me for trying
at least i
see that there
i knew that boy had talent
alanor salah bidara
do not let them escape
or you will suffer
a fate far worse
than that which hath
been inflicted upon me
so there i am hogtied
lying on my back
this orc starts poking me
with the spear
kind of a nowin situation
so i say to myself
what do l got to lose
so i take that spear
and bite it
and i start chewing
idol of idols
with an elf
you got to be kidding
the problem with elves is
they got no meat on their bones
you got to get yourself
a nice 250pound dwarf
with hair on her chin
you can hang on to
excuse me little man
you looking for somebody
in particular
or are you just looking for
somebody
actually
im looking for someone
just like you

wait
i need the girl
bar fight

to control red dragons
i dont know about you

the eye of the dragon
from the guildmaster
of the thieves guild

i wouldnt do that
if i were you
hey its you
you know her
were acquainted
is that the elf
you were drooling over
i wouldnt put it that way
but yeah thats her
pretty huh
they all look alike to me
silence
where is the girl
none of your business
wrong human
it is my business to arrest you
and marina of pretensa
and to take you
and the scroll you stole
back to the empress of izmer
so youre the law are you
i should have known
one of your fellow lawmen
in fact the chief
of the crimson brigade
beat you to the punch
he just took off with marina
damodar
thats him
only hes not working
for the law anymore
hes working for profion
hes the one you want not us
your majesty
yes norda
have you found me the scroll
no your highness
i have unfortunate tidings
to report
it seems profion
also seeks the rod
but how could he know
i do not know milady
damodar has captured
marina of pretensa
and the scroll
but i have her companions
in my custody
what is your command
seek damodar out
we need that rod
the council demands my response
imminently
norda please hurry
our time is running out
as you wish
gather the horses
we will track damodar
they will travel with us
should they try to escape
kill them
tell me
why were you
at the thieves guild
it isnt exactly
a sightseeing spot is it
we needed money for supplies
youll have to do better
than that
im curious
youre a mage
and yet youre
disgracing your family
by consorting with thieves
youre a disgrace to izmer
conspiring against the empress
i have no dispute with her
you know me
i have served her family loyally
for many a year
it is profions desire
to dethrone her
not mine
then why do you help him
look at me
look at me
if i do not obtain the rod
i will die
please
help me
im sorry but i
i cannot help you
foolish girl
i can suck
the information i want
right out of you
your friends have procured
the eye of the dragon
from the thieves maze
a key
of some sort
cant i just walk
dont you people know dwarves
are terrified of horses
get over it
a lot of dwarves are afraid
to show their true feelings
im not ok
they followed the valley
i know these lands
theres a shortcut up ahead
through the forest
and over those hills
it means leaving the trail
but if damodar sets up camp
and we ride all night
we stand a good chance
of cutting him off
all right lets go
i love the way you track
you wouldnt happen
to be single are you
what
theres no harm in asking
is there
it just so happens
that im single
can you believe it
how old are you
twentythree l know
im a little young for you
what if i get my hands
on an aging potion
ill sacrifice
a couple of years for you
im 234
oh damn
i didnt mean
that much of a change
hurry
ridley lookbeholders
relax snails
well just sneak around em
now what
a little distraction
all right snails stay close
all clear
ok ill get marina
you get the map
ok hey wait ridley
how you get the girl
and i get a map
we got to work out
some new plans
go
be careful
all right
you too
lets go in
we were not meant
to enter this place
this task
they must complete alone
im damodar
a little black magic
all right damodar
nice
piece of cake
i knew this was too easy
need a hand
its ok
lets get you out of here
come on
just like you thieves
always taking things
that dont belong to you
all right now
im mad
you want to play do you
yeah lets play
ok you win game over
there they are
so much for getting
out of here without a fight
thanks
anytime
hit him  hit him
lets go
come on
you cannot be serious
ive never been so serious
oh please
if youll give me
the dragons eye
i might decide
to let you die quickly
go to hell
not your usual punctual self
wheres my dragons eye
i have it
really
show it to me
let him go first
and its yours
snails dont
make it easy on yourself
give me what is mine
never
youre as stubborn
as your friend
very well
youve made your choice
come on ridley
transporting
come on ridley
come on
the council has voted
you must oblige us
you understand the consequences
of your decision
do not patronize me azmath
for i understand all too well
yes i violate the law
in defying the council
but if i were
to give you this scepter
my crime would be graver yet
for i would be
defying my conscience
and our people
have you all forgotten
this council was created to
protect the people of izmer
but ask yourselves
is this what you are doing
i say not
your concern
is only for yourselves
not the people
and your majesty
is forcing the empire
to the verge of civil war
in the best interests
of the people
the man who convinced you
to take the scepter from me
so that he would leave
the state defenseless
be careful my friends
for once hes done with me
this council may be next
war benefits no one profion
and i oppose it
but if it is necessary to obtain
the freedom of our people
then no cost could be too great
to achieve that goal
do you hear her words
she violates our highest law
and then seeks to force us
into submission
with a threat of war
each citizen of izmer
whether a commoner or a mage
deserves an equal right
for prosperity
and as empress
this is how i decree
izmer shall be run
from this day forward
such pretty words
my friends i warned you
that this headstrong child
will defy you and destroy you
her youth
denies her the wisdom
to understand why
some things cannot change
but idealism is for children
and a child is not fit
to govern an empire
i ask you one last time
will you submit
to the ruling of this council
and relinquish your scepter
i was praying
that you would
find the wisdom
to see that the path
i propose for izmer
is the right one
i do not wish to fight you
but i will not
leave the empire
at the mercy
of an unscrupulous charlatan
so decide as you must
but know one thing
i am not afraid
a wonderful performance
my friends ask yourselves
are we prepared to see
our empire
destroyed by a child
then is now not the time
we should act
then down with the tyrants
and let the war begin
what is he doing
isnt he going to use
any spells
wait
how did you do that
the elven people do not require
spells to work with magic
you use magic
we are part of it
part of magic
as are all living creatures
including dragons
sadly humans see only
their destructive powers
i had a dream i saw
you saw a dragon being born
it was amazing
life was exploding all around
so it should
you see when dragons are born
they bring new magic with them
magic is the life force
of our world
it keeps nature
and everything around us
in balance
and if many dragons should die
life would wither as it must
and the balance
would be destroyed
the rod
you and your countrymen
are very close
to irreparably destroying
the fabric of magic
with this rod you seek
the rod is manmade
unnatural
it must not be disturbed
you must rest
im sorry about snails
im sure you are
he died for a good cause
a good cause
what cause is that
the empress against profion
politics
im through with all that
im not going to die
over some power struggle
between a couple
of greedy mages
no youre wrong
no youre wrong mage
you never had to live
on the other side
you know what
snails was right
there is nothing we can do
to change it
and if i had listened to him
he would still be alive
just because some mages are evil
does not mean they all are
im not
let me let you in
on a little secret
the empress that snails died for
stands to lose everything
because she is fighting
to change things
as if she has anything
to worry about
you are so naive
she risks everything
because she does not believe
the system is fair
profion seeks to dethrone her
because she believes
that mages and commoners
should be treated as equals
she is fighting to change
what you hate so much
that ridley
is what snails died for
when vildan told me what was
happening with the empress
i wanted to do
all l could to help her
but even then
i did not understand
why she would want commoners
to be equal with us
but now
after being with you
for only a few days
and seeing how you always manage
to find your way
i understand why the empress
is right
please ridley
help me show them
we are not like they are
you know for a mage
youre pretty smart
it will protect you
thank you
all right this is it
this is the entrance
to the dungeon
what happened
what is it
its a wall force of some kind
ive never seen
this kind of magic
only you were meant to pass
i guess l go alone then
be careful
dont worry ill be fine
great
now what
sorry snails
finally
a mage who got what he deserved
why do you disturb
the rod of savrille
to save the empire of izmer
who
what are you
i am savrille
creator of the rod
cursed with the crime of trying
to control the red dragons
and sentenced
to this purgatory
until someone worthy
of its power takes it
you are such a man
i dont know
if anybodys such a man
but im going to find out
be warned anyone who wields
the power of the rod
shall suffer a horrible fate
for the evil it creates
cannot be undone
unless its spell is broken
how do i break the spell
that you must discover
the empress has called
her dragons upon us
dont just stand there
admiring them
destroy them
before they reach us
hurry hurry
prepare to fire
fire
come on
get up prepare to fire again
move that crossbow
aim for their wings you fools
fire you fools fire
what have i done
come to me
i found the rod
thanks for saving me
the trouble
feels good doesnt it
remember
your stupidity and persistence
got your thief friend killed
dont let it be responsible
for finishing off the rest
of your social circle
oh look
ive cut her what a shame
dont hurt her
then give me the rod
and youll release them
dont do it ridley
you have my word
finally
you said youd let them go
i lied
kill them
slowly
give that to me
you said youd set me free
now what about my head
here they come
come damodar
to the roof of sumdall
fire
my destiny
come to me
look ive cut you
what a shame
you can run your ladyship
but youll never run far enough
let their blood
rain from the sky
youll pay for that boy
you really think
that you can steal my destiny
ill invent a new destiny
especially for you
full of pain
a new kind of pain
and new senses to feel it with
not if i kill you first
this will be a real pleasure
not so talented eh mr ridley
ive enjoyed our little chat
but now its your time to die
my little tracker
i could
hey mage
why dont you pick on somebody
your own size
back for more
you really think you can
use that you little burglar
well thats impossible
bring them down on him ridley
destroy him
i wont become you
what have you done
your majesty
its over profion
the battle maybe your majesty
maybe
but not the war
thank you
people of izmer
at long last i do declare
that you are now all equal
let the celebration begin
you hear that buddy
thats for you
nothings going to be the same
without you
but i guess ill
have to get used to that
i just hope wherever you are
you know that you did
make a difference
you helped things change
you finally got it
your big score
i guess id better get going
or im going to miss
