so why do not we take the shiroko
i dont drive the shiroko
do you have a license
yes
so you have a license and a
car and were in the train
please be quiet
im just sayin
seems like we couldve saved a
lot of money dont you think
do you always ask these many questions
im sorry
so what we are learning today
chi
eternal energy the essence of life
it moves inside of us
flows through our bodies
give us power from within
i get it like the
force from star wars
youre yoda and im
like im like a jedi
is this where you learned kung fu
yes
everything good about me was born here
so dre you gotta leave your
backpack and skateboard here
so where are we going
the journey to the top of the mountain
tomb of the dragon well
dragon well its probably closer
than it is im looking at it
right
are we there yet
soon
how do you say water in chinese
shui
i need some shui
im really thirsty
im thirsty mr han
water on top of the mountain
shao dre
the journey is complete
this is the dragon well
yes
i stood here with my
father when i was your age
he told me thats the
magic kung fu water
you drink and nothing can defeat you
its the best water ive ever tasted
did you see the lady with the snake
yes
she was doing the cobra
thing she was like
copying the snake and it was like
right here and she was like
you did not watch
closely enough shao dre
the snake was copying the woman
what i dont get it
look
what do you see
me well my reflection  yes
now what do you see
its blurry  yes
that woman was sliced
through water quiet and calm
in here and in here
so the snake reflects her
action like still water
like a mirror
yes
so she controlled a
snake by doing nothing
being still and doing nothing
are two very different things
she used her chi on that snake didnt she
very good
you gotta teach me that
how to control people
there is only one person you
need to learn how to control
who
empty your mind flow with my movement
connect to the energy around you
i kinda just want to learn the cobra thing
cobra takes a lifetime
requires great focus
but i have great focus
oh my god mr han
your focus
needs more focus
mr han
thank you mr han
theres no such thing as
fortune cookies in china
