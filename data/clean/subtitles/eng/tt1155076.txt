go home 
  what s up with the light bulbs  mr  han 
  shh 
i thought you are just
a maintenance man 
you ve seen only with your
eyes  so you are easy to fool 
it doesn t hurt 
chauva  ancient chinese healing 
how did you do that up there  you like even
didn t punch them  they   beat each other up 
when fighting angry  blind men   
best we just stay out of the way 
  so  where did you learn kung fu 
  from father 
have you ever taught anybody 
no 
would you 
  depends 
  on what 
  reason 
  what about to kick somebody s ass 
the best fights are the ones we avoid 
what if i wanna avoid
getting my ass kicked 
  stop saying  ass  
  sorry 
kung fu is for knowledge  defense 
not to make war  but to create peace 
that s not definitely
what they re taught 
no such thing as bad
student  only bad teacher 
that s great  i guess we ll just stroll in
their school and talk to their teacher 
  good idea 
  no  bad idea 
if i go in there  i get my ass kick   
  i ll get beat up 
  you got beat up anyway 
would you go with me 
no  sorry 
  but you said it was a good idea 
  for you  bad idea for me 
c mon  it s not like you should be busy
or anything   i don t even speak chinese 
very sorry 
okay   whatever 
wait 
what are you doing  why did you stop 
finish 
okay  mr  han  let s get out of here 
we do not stop when our enemy is down 
no mercy 
no mercy in the studio 
no mercy in life 
what are you looking at 
he s the one that attacked me 
we are here to make peace 
let your little thing mind himself 
one to one  no problem   six to
one  too much to ask of anyone 
i see 
prepare for match 
whoa mr  han  does he want us to fight 
we are not here to fight 
you attack my students
and disrespect my studio  
you want to leave  not so easy 
master li

one of you fights now 
the boy will fight there 
open kung fu tournament
we accept your challenge 
please instruct your students
to leave my boy alone to train 
attention 
from now on the little
thing is to be left alone   
until the tournament 
  understood  
  yes 
if he does not show up
for the competition   
i will bring pain to him and you 
so  that go pretty much
how you planned it 
there s good news and bad news 
the good news is they
promised to leave you alone 
  really 
  while you prepare 
prepare for what 
the tournament  you ll
fight them all  one by one 
huh 
so the bad news is now they
get to beat me up in public

her mother does not approve of him 
so  she cuts a wide river in the
sky to separate them forever 
but once a year  all
the birds in the sky

together for a single night

kung fu lives in everything
we do  shao dre 
it lives in how we put on a jacket 
and how we take off the jacket 
it lives in how we treat people 
everything is kung fu 
  so  why do not we take the shiroko 
  i don t drive the shiroko 
  do you have a license 
  yes 
so you have a license and a
car and we re in the train 
  please  be quiet 
  i m just sayin    
seems like we could ve saved a
lot of money  don t you think 
  do you always ask these many questions 
  i m sorry 
so  what we are learning today 
chi 
eternal energy  the essence of life 
it moves inside of us 
flows through our bodies 
give us power from within 
i get it  like the
 force  from star wars 
you re yoda  and i m
like    i m like a jedi 
  is this where you learned kung fu 
  yes 
everything good about me was born here 
so dre  you gotta leave your
backpack and skateboard here 
  so  where are we going 
  the journey to the top of the mountain 
tomb of the dragon well 
dragon well  it s probably  closer
than it is  i m looking at it 
right 
  are we there yet 
  soon 
  how do you say water in chinese 
  shui 
i need some shui 
i m really thirsty 
  i m thirsty  mr  han 
  water on top of the mountain 
shao dre 
the journey is complete 
  this is the dragon well 
  yes 
i stood here with my
father  when i was your age 
he told me that s the
magic kung fu water 
you drink and nothing can defeat you 
it s the best water i ve ever tasted 
  did you see the lady with the snake 
  yes 
she was doing the cobra
thing  she was like   
copying the snake  and it was like   
right here  and she was like   
you did not watch
closely enough  shao dre 
the snake was copying the woman 
what  i don t get it 
look 
  what do you see 
  me  well my reflection    yes 
  now  what do you see 
  it s blurry    yes 
that woman was sliced
through water quiet and calm 
in here and in here 
so  the snake reflects her
action  like still water 
  like a mirror 
  yes 
so  she controlled a
snake by doing nothing 
being still and doing nothing 
are two very different things 
  she used her chi on that snake  didn t she 
  very good 
you gotta teach me that 
how to control people 
there is only one person you
need to learn how to control 
who 
empty your mind  flow with my movement 
connect to the energy  around you 
  i kinda just want to learn the cobra thing 
  cobra takes a lifetime 
  requires great focus 
  but i have great focus  
  oh my god  mr  han   
  your focus 
  needs more focus 
  mr  han   
thank you  mr  han 
there s no such thing as
fortune cookies in china 
dre  please be careful
crossing the street 
you just scared the life out of me  the
other day  they have the  right of way  
and the symbols  i can t get the
symbols right on the bathrooms 
and i m still walkin 
into the men s restroom 
the other day i walked in  there
was this 90 years old chinese man 
he thought he was
getting a little treat 
dre  please stop that  you look
crazy  here  eat your noodles 
mr  han  what s goin  on 
anticipation 
i can t see   
don t see it  feel it 
dammit  mr  han 
i felt that one 
  mr  han 
  what 
  concentrate  okay 
  okay  do i get the stick now 
  dre  you okay 
  i m okay 
what s up mr  han  what time
we are trainin  tomorrow
