stand taller be brittle edgy
a matador relates to death
to anxiety so be edgy
clara look down
be a bit submissive
not too much
a bit submissive to the man
at three you look at me
lts all in your look
at three raise yourself
on your toes and look at me
one two three
excellent
you think l dont suffer too
you think l enjoy
seeing you unhappy
l told you
lm always like this
with other girls it lasted a week
then for 6 months we did nothing
really
with you
its lasted 3 months
lts all weve done
night and day
dont exaggerate
we never did it all night
come on
wed make love twice in a row
l dont think so
ln fact
l think it never happened
anyway now l can cheat on you
but you cant
no getting a hardon for another girl
if you dont for me
have you cheated on me
no
youre lucky you wont
make me give up sex
l havent cheated on you
but l should have
what does that mean
look me in the eyes
have you ever
absolutely not
lt means lm too dumb
you dont deserve
my faithfulness
know why you drink
so you can collapse
in bed like a log
you only love me
when theres a table between us
since we met weve been
together every night
lve eaten opposite you
lm never bored
right
you like me when
theres a table between us
lts insane l sleep over with
a guy who doesnt touch me
you havent in ages
we discussed that
you swore youd do something
wait
for the end of the world
you have to wait
maybe 3 more months
theres more to life than that
what are you doing
you splitting
no
lts not that serious
yes it is
an invisible cage heavy
leaden descends on me
a tacit interdiction
take off your tshirt
l dont want to sleep
with a cotton bag l hate cotton
no
get undressed and come to bed
why wont you take it off
you know l cant stand it
l feel it against me
lll take it off
but not my shorts
they keep my balls warm
lts nothing to do with you
l never thought
wed be together every night
anyway thats how it is
lts my fault too
l thought youd have other things
to do than see me every night
wed not meet
for 2 weeks a month
youd let me disappear
no
not without staying in touch
not if youre
in paris when l am
you dont trust me
lll leave
lf you want lll leave
youll never see me again
see how you are
we cant even talk
get into bed
take that off
l said its nothing
to do with you
lve always slept like this
lt is to do with me
lts because you hate me
stop it
l told you never to try that
youre just postponing things
but youre hard
stop or its all over between us
lt means you can
doesnt interest me
be nice why wont you
lf you couldnt get it up
ld understand
youve decided to stop
making love just when l
watch out
lll want to kill myself
lve never done this with a guy
l never touched them
never
lt must be important to you
since you harp on it
even if you dont want to
if you cant l dont get it
then caress me lf you cant
get any pleasure give me some
women come
a lot more than men
lf l did that
ld despise you
l couldnt love you any more
you despise me
because lm a woman
you dont love me one bit
l disgust you l appall you
you think lm the lowest
stop it
come to bed
why can l only
love him or hate him
why cant l feel indifferent
yet my head is clear
a man who cant
love me physically
is a pit of misfortune
a gulf of suffering
they say that a man
who screws a woman honors her
the expression
is worth noting lts true
paul dishonors me
do you mind
on the contrary
just came for a nightcap
l just got out of bed
lts true
l just got dressed
l cant stand sleeping
so l got up
l dont give a damn about time
lm never tired
l hate people who feign fatigue
who have endless pretexts
you agree
lts because they lack passion
you live alone
no l have a husband
l told him l had a husband
so hed know lm not free
because lm not free
hell have to realize
its adultery
hes asleep
sleeping doesnt bother him at all
he has to get up early tomorrow
he has a business appointment
in deauville at noon
do you have a girlfriend
she died in a car accident
l havent made love in 4 months
maybe all men are like that
my husbands nice
but hes not interested in sex
the first moves
are what l like best
lts delicious
l can never stop
myself from yielding
lt surprises me each time
l watch myself giving in
as if it wasnt me
frankly
l wanted another taste of that miracle
a stranger making love to you
lts a childish desire
a pure desire
give me a blow job
not now
this evening or tomorrow
give me your phone number
you dont feel like it
to blow you
not really
lts not my specialty
l dont like
to start with that
ld rather resume that way
if you see what l mean
but going to a hotel
lm dying to do that
now l have to split
in fact right away
dont want to go to a hotel
l have to go to work
and l have to return the car
lts not mine
will you call me
sorry lm late
doesnt matter
l took attendance
take out your grammar notebooks
and write todays date
last week we did the present
tense of the verb to be
l am you are he is
we are you are they are
today well do to have
to have isnt like to be
one can be without having
one can have without being
lve been had
lve really been had
l wish you were pregnant
fat chance of that
why
lt could happen
how by the holy ghost
you dreaming
theres no way
ever since l stopped the pill
you hate details
but there are dates
lf you hardly ever do it and cant
on the right days itll never happen
thats what depresses me
thats different
lf you say its chore time
lll do it
really
yes
thatd change everything
lf we had a child
itd make sense to be together
lts because
youve lost faith
ltll come back
lts like the circean myth
you want to know the future
and the past
you even mess with the present
you force it
youve lost faith
so everything collapses
what if l left
and didnt phone
for 2 weeks or a month
or 6 months
would we be through
depends
lf you go to the north pole
or to a desert maybe
but if you see a phone
and always say
l wont call that dumb girl
and hang out in every bar
in my neighborhood
ld say weve broken up
l talk of freedom
you talk of bars
lts statistics
a guy needs to remake
the world with his pals in a bar
or he dies
you know l dont cheat on you
maybe ld rather you did
and also screwed me
anyway l can cheat on you
but you cant on me
you already done it
you talk about it a lot
no
but you deserve to think l have
ok
tomorrow night
lm dining with ashley
you can come
but you know what ld prefer
that l didnt come
l know l should
let him live
but l need to cling
to him like a leech
because lm madly
in love with him
what he calls breathing
suffocates me
l never asked to be free
and l dont want
him to be either
lm a real stickler
for absolutes
and l think lm right
but when l apply it to life
it really makes me go schizo
he dances because
he wants to seduce
he wants to seduce
because he wants to conquer
he wants to conquer
because hes a man
now what is it
you make a scene
cause l dance with a girl
not a girl some bimbo
who gives a fuck about her
then dont give a fuck
l wont have
a kid with anyone else
you insist l wear one
l havent screwed in 6 months
l dont have alds
youre getting better
you seem to enjoy it
youre almost triumphant
you want me to watch
you slip on your condom
at first you hid
think so
l do
l didnt dare look
l dont like looking at a cock
once theyve been used
theyre revolting
not very pretty
they are rather disgusting
lts like a tampax to screw
you take it out discreetly
hide it under the bed
so the guys not turned off
guys are easily disgusted
later you have to retrieve it
l quite like disgusting things
know why most guys
cant use a condom
their cocks
arent hard enough
as they say the rubber
rubs them out
l wouldnt know
l dont sleep with guys
lts true
they go limp all the time
because theyre
not really horny
lts like in porn flicks
girls stuff limp cocks
in their mouths
they have to give blow jobs
because theyre not really wanted
a guy should
take you without a word
but he shouldnt bug
you with his inadequacy
sometimes a blow job is fine
lts ok when the guy
could screw you but wont
thats the tantalus torture
lt makes you admit
you can do that
or even worse
as long as he
ends up screwing you
most guys have cocks
that are short thin
and pointed
pointed
like a dogs cock
l hate that
length isnt everything
theres the base
a thin cock isnt noble
shall l stick it in your ass
not yet
screw me some more
l havent had enough
my boyfriend doesnt screw me
how can you love a guy
who doesnt screw you
l dont like the guys
who screw me
l hate them
l dont want to see
the men who screw me
or look at them
l want to be a hole
a pit
the more gaping
the more obscene it is
the more its me
my intimacy
the more l surrender
lts metaphysical
l disappear in proportion
to the cock taking me
l hollow myself
thats my purity
you like your back
being tickled
no l dont like tenderness
or to be kissed on the mouth
l couldnt stand that
l dont care
who stuffs my cunt
but l cant kiss
someone l dont love
lts too intimate
but l kissed paolo
l felt like it
when l kissed him
l stopped thinking about paul
so l decided
to stop seeing him
lt was a question of integrity
what are you doing
nothing
l have a class
you like my cock
l like its smell
youre disgusting
no it smells good
l like it that
its not too large
lt fits in my hand
and fits in my mouth
why do you like it
lts mine
l dont know
lts like a bird
feels like l have
a bird in my hand
you see when
you move like that
lts as if it wanted
to fly away
but it doesnt
thats touching
you mind that we dont
go all the way
what l mind is you wont
let me caress you
l really resent that
l do let you caress me
but not all the way
dont worry
l dont come either
dlctatlon
winter months
everyone had settled
for a life
that was dull
and orderly
period
then suddenly
comma
light
burst forth
once again
period
spring
had come
exclamation point
l know
my spelling is awful
how did l pass
my teaching exams
or get my drivers license
l cant parallel park
thats less serious
youre not behind me
when lm double parked
l think lm dislex
dislexic
like with math
my reasoning was fine
but l couldnt learn
multiplication tables
thats a problem
nice place
surprises you eh
lts small
but it has everything
girls want to see
what theyve seen on tv
sliding japanese screens are in
so thats what l have
jacuzzis are in
so lve got one
for a small place
it has everything its a theater
lts like a stage
where l can rehearse
lm a high class bum
whos not handsome
yet lve had
over 10000 women
why me
because you have
to talk to them
nobody bothers to talk
to women anymore
l talk they listen
theyre in the palm of my hand
then l put my hand
in the right place without asking
so it goes
somebody has
to get things going
the only way
to be loved by women
is via rape
women yield to a stranger
but play hard to get
with a wretch who loves them
so it goes
but do they want
to be respected
ln a sense yes
but respect
is in the nature of things
since theyre up for grabs
they want to be taken
lve had 10000 women
l dont remember them all
but l kept their names their age
and the circumstances
their cunts
no two are alike
theyre as memorable as faces
but take ten men
cut off their cocks
put them in a basket
no one can tell his own
l did a radio show
they wanted
proof of my statistics
yes indeed
they counted them
dr weil a psychiatrist
and sexologist
knows a true casanova
a super don juan
a prince among seducers
why does she call me
a prince of seducers
lts absurd
l never seduced anyone
any woman
l know
lm not very handsome
l may even be revolting
but the fact is
lve had 10000 women
several per day
lve been a seducer
in the sense of se aductere
to draw to ones self
we checked him out
he kept a record of his conquests
lve got something
that will interest you
l bought it knowing some day
ld make you read it
here it is
read me this sentence
one shouldnt lend books
women should read to us
so we know theyve read it
l hate reading
read it
women must read to us
as the mother begets the son
the son begets the mother
his act is the creative
counterpoint of the process
by begetting the mother
he purifies her
he purifies her
and himself uno acto
he turns the babylonian whore
into a virgin
youre making me shy
whats come over me
yet youre the one who
lm fine
you see
l see nothing
youre posing
lm being myself
this kind of embarrassment
lm perfectly natural
ls desire
lts part of the game
lf we didnt lack words
when it comes to acts
wed instantly tell them
hands off
thats what this is
a trivial relationship
a very shameful one
why do men who disgust us
understand us better
than those who appeal to us
theres a hole in your spelling
yet youre a teacher
yes a hole
there
youre amazed that
lm fingering your pussy
but its me doing it
lm not aroused yet
but you are
youre amazed its me
so it goes
beautiful women
get taken by ugly men
thats a wellkept secret
there has to be action
the action isnt between man
and woman thats too simple
lts between
beauty and ugliness
beauty feeds on degradation
communes with it
thats where l come in
l make the most of it
so it goes
dont blame me
shall l dominate you
open your eyes
shall l gag you
lt implies going further
than its reasonable
for a woman to accept
she may have to go beyond
what she agreed to
you dont yearn
for what you cant accept
physical love is triviality
clashing with the divine
lts strange
obscenity doesnt bother women
ls it too painful
take it off
l cant stand it
l didnt realize
you shouldve told me
l thought l could go far with you
l can tie you up less severely
or we can make love normally
lm ok
lts me
my problem is
you know
nobody ever tied me up before
l never did it
really you never did
l always wanted to
well resume
l wont tie you as tightly
no
lts fine
lt has to be this way
really
was it good for you too
for me it was very beautiful
truly beautiful
l want to give you pleasure
when you cry l panic
l feel lve done
something wrong
no its fine
at first
you feel your hands going numb
you think you can stand it
then suddenly its unbearable
a form of dying
a galloping death
you think your
hands will fall off
you slowly turn
into dead flesh
and then
it has to stop at once
it cant last a second more
l was afraid you couldnt hear
because of the gag
lts really freaky
but you liked the gag
l dont like
having to say things
when l got home
paul wasnt there
that made my world
fall apart
lt has nothing to do
with what l did
whats done is done
lts behind me
my head is very clear
lts all l can be
in my head
l feel my body
doesnt belong to me
lts an anonymous appendix
ln my head theres paul
he could have reconciled me
with my body
but he didnt want to do that
because l dont like my body
l was an easy prey
l mean a victim
anyway women are the victims
men need for atonement
l always masturbate
with my legs closed
l rarely part them
l can offer myself to myself
rape myself
lts mildly satisfying
a bit nauseating
but its proof l dont need a man
if l have to resort to this
lt was painful for me
to be on his bed
a pain you could call
feeling like lost luggage
the more time went by
the less l could bear it
l had to cast myself out
like a wreck
ln the basic meaning of the word
up for grabs
the only thing l told myself
like a twobit equation
was that if ld cheated on him
and still only loved him
it didnt much matter
if hed cheated on me
but he hadnt lt was worse
he was thrilled to be alone
love between men and women
let it be said again
is a devious conflict
there
l win if lm last to get home
l know it
lll have an edge on him
20 just to eat you
thats my dream
to know that for some guy
lm just a pussy he wants to stuff
without sentimental bullshit
just raw desire
to be taken by a guy
anyone a nobody
a bum with whom you wallow
for the joy of wallowing
for the dishonor
the discredit
thats pleasure to a girl
turn over
show me your rosebud
pay me
youve got no choice bitch
you like me
slut
whore bitch
l reamed you good
lm not ashamed
asshole
ls nymphomania
destroying yourself
because you choose a man
who doesnt love you
l dont want
to sleep with men
l want to be opened up
all the way
when you can see that the mystique
is a load of innards
the woman is dead
maybe l really want to meet
jack the ripper
hed certainly dissect
a woman like me
once again l hung around an hour
so ld be the last to get home
thats proof that women are capable
of more love than men
much more love
hes waiting for me too
when l get home after him
its not as easy
the little guys edgy
l just got home
me too
so l see
but l just got home too
sure you wouldnt watch
the idiot box for an hour
a love affair deals
with an older mans obsession
for a young prostitute
so he wont screw me
maybe due to his education
women always
seemed strange to him
he preferred the company
of his friends
women were from another world
somewhat superior
my cunt is swollen and moist
l can hold out forever
he wont beat me down this way
when he wants an evening
without me
l make the most of it
l get tied up
lts his fault
shall l dominate you
want to tie me up
today you choose
l dont want to do anything
you like being tied up
yes but not my elbows
last time my hands
were numb for 2 weeks
a month ago
one elbow still felt weird
thats abnormal
youve got bad circulation
one day in cannes
l picked up grace delly
lf ld known it was her
l wouldnt have dared
but she liked me and made a date
to meet at my place
she rang
blonde impeccable hairdo
in a hounds tooth tailleur
a bitch for a hound dog
l screw her love in the afternoon
she leaves in fine spirits
next day l see her
l was with a friend
l tell him
l screwed that woman
he says
you screwed grace delly
l looked at him
l didnt know
see lm not handsome
or wealthy or attractive
but l screwed her
later l went over to her
we have a drink
and l ask her why
why didnt you say
you were grace delly
would you have behaved
the same way
l guess not
you dont act the same way
with grace delly
you wear kid gloves
what a pity
that was nice
wait
this doesnt hurt
too bad
l dont have two
doesnt matter
lll do it this way
there raise your ass
lll lift your skirt
like that
lll spread your legs ok
l think you like it
when l spread your legs
wait
l love it
there
thats nice
now lll put this on
wait
help me
thats beautiful
youre lovely like that
lts beautiful
now lll gag you
l enjoyed it so much
l grew attached to robert
tying me up without tying me down
was the secret of his ritual
after these sessions
l wasnt gloomy we giggled
we partied and overate
the guy was flat broke
so she said to him
you want more caviar
more caviar
waiter please
more caviar
and vodka
l love to tipple
but l never get drunk
or what they call drunk
can we have
some more vodka too
you seem fine
you see your pals
me my girlfriends
l bet you badmouth us
we badmouth you
we do we dont
help me
caress me
l cant you kept it on
lf thats all it takes
love is dumb
lts just a power trip
a guy youre faithful to
wont screw you
cheat on him
and he screws you
they dont guess youre cheating
they sense youre getting away
my fists are closed
l cant do a thing
now what
whats this act
why cant you see
l only do this with you
lve never touched
anyones cock
then why wont you
leave me alone
because you do nothing
now
you be me
you be the woman
lll be your guy lll screw you
can you believe it
thats how that selfish bastard
got me pregnant
nobody came
not even him
he did a virgin mary stunt on me
with a drop of seminal fluid
let your legs fall
relax there
the neck is closed good
the uterus is
lts been 8 weeks
your turn
thats how l became a case study
for pimply interns
a slab of meat
once youre pregnant
they spread your legs
and peer all the way
up your vagina
then l took
a bitter liking to it
as ld made a truce with robert
while l was pregnant
nobody else touched me
my only sexual relationships
became my monthly visits
lm uneasy on an exam table
l resent spreading my legs
thats why it affects me
lm a bit of an icemaiden
l see why the chinese used
an ivory replica to probe your body
though even thats distasteful
porn movies too protect your libido
you watch a surrogate image
but what you cant tolerate
you cant tolerate in images either
an image is just as compromising
since it stands for you
very good
paul is right
you cant love a face
if a cunt goes with it
a cunt doesnt go with a face
l fantasize about a brothel
where a head
is separated from a body
by a guillotinelike contraption
before the blade comes down
of course theres no blade
l wear a silky red skirt
that billows up and rustles
and those silly trappings
that give men a hardon
lts proof a hardon
doesnt mean they love us
paul is right being a woman
has a fatal flaw
lf she gets you hard
you want to bone her
wanting to bone her
is to despise her
love between men and women
is impossible
men you cant see
you imagine coarse and apelike
aziz look at my cock
as if crudeness
is all one can expect
there we see the head
that was the spine
the thigh bone
want to know what it is
lts a boy
fabulous
you want me to marry you
yes
that night paul made love to me
for the first time in ages
and for the last time
from then on he lugged me around
like a ball and chain
a duty he had to endure
we went out every evening
with his sister and brotherinlaw
now that l was
the mother of his son
ld met his whole family
you ok
two whiskies
you ok
fine
want another drink
later
please dont make a scene
no scene
l felt like dancing
so l grabbed a girl
l almost kissed her
she was so hot for me
then l dumped her
where l picked her up
she never knew what happened
so you cant complain
l didnt
but secretly you do
a whisky please
you two quit loving each other
you hold her like a deadbeat
sit down
not too tired
lm fine
shes my sister
but lll tell her
that a man likes a challenge
he hates being followed around
he needs to fear
he may lose her
then he chases her
or chases someone else
a mans always chasing
you agree
you and your chasings a bore
the bastard
he leaves me alone
with my anxiety
that soon my vagina will expand
and expel the baby
wake up
lm sick of your boozing
you slob
you dumb male model
be right down
whats going on
youll like it
get on the table
wait for the contraction to pass
breathe deeply
breathe
once its over get on the table
no the father cant stay
yes he can
am l getting an epidural
lts too late
your babys being born
ready were going to
push out the baby
lnhale
lnhale hold your breath
grab the bar
push hard again
with all your might
hold your breath more
lts incredible to create life
lnhale
hold your breath and push
go on
they say a woman isnt a woman
till shes a mother
lts true
nothing that happened before
really matters
