stand taller  be brittle  edgy 
a matador relates to death 
to anxiety  so be edgy 
clara  look down 
be a bit submissive 
not too much 
a bit submissive to the man 
at three  you look at me 
lt s all in your look 
at three  raise yourself
on your toes and look at me 
one  two  three 
excellent 
you think l don t suffer  too 
you think l enjoy
seeing you unhappy 
l told you 
l m always like this 
with other girls it lasted a week 
then for 6 months we did nothing 
really 
with you 
it s lasted 3 months 
lt s all we ve done 
night and day 
don t exaggerate 
we never did it all night 
come on 
we d make love twice in a row 
l don t think so 
ln fact 
l think it never happened 
anyway  now l can cheat on you 
but you can t 
no getting a hard on for another girl 
if you don t for me 
have you cheated on me 
no 
you re lucky  you won t
make me give up sex 
l haven t cheated on you 
but l should have 
what does that mean 
look me in the eyes 
  have you ever 
  absolutely not 
lt means l m too dumb 
you don t deserve
my faithfulness 
know why you drink 
so you can collapse
in bed like a log 
you only love me
when there s a table between us 
since we met  we ve been
together every night 
l ve eaten opposite you 
l m never bored 
right 
you like me when
there s a table between us 
lt s insane  l sleep over with
a guy who doesn t touch me 
you haven t in ages 
  we discussed that 
  you swore you d do something 
  wait 
  for the end of the world 
you have to wait 
maybe 3 more months 
there s more to life than that 
what are you doing 
you splitting 
no 
lt s not that serious 
yes  it is 
an invisible cage  heavy 
leaden  descends on me   
a tacit interdiction 
take off your t shirt 
l don t want to sleep
with a cotton bag  l hate cotton 
no 
get undressed and come to bed 
why won t you take it off 
you know l can t stand it 
l feel it against me 
l ll take it off 
but not my shorts 
they keep my balls warm 
lt s nothing to do with you 
l never thought
we d be together every night 
anyway  that s how it is 
lt s my fault  too 
l thought you d have other things
to do than see me every night 
we d not meet
for 2 weeks  a month 
you d let me disappear 
no 
not without staying in touch 
not if you re
in paris when l am 
you don t trust me 
l ll leave   
lf you want  l ll leave 
you ll never see me again 
see how you are 
we can t even talk 
get into bed 
take that off 
l said it s nothing
to do with you 
l ve always slept like this 
lt is to do with me 
lt s because you hate me 
stop it 
l told you never to try that 
you re just postponing things 
  but you re hard 
  stop  or it s all over between us 
lt means you can 
doesn t interest me 
be nice  why won t you 
lf you couldn t get it up 
l d understand 
you ve decided to stop
making love  just when l   
watch out 
l ll want to kill myself 
l ve never done this with a guy 
l never touched them 
never 
lt must be important to you 
since you harp on it 
even if you don t want to 
if you can t  l don t get it 
then caress me  lf you can t
get any pleasure give me some 
women come
a lot more than men 
lf l did that 
l d despise you 
l couldn t love you any more 
you despise me
because l m a woman 
you don t love me one bit 
l disgust you  l appall you 
you think l m the lowest 
stop it 
come to bed 
why can l only
love him or hate him 
why can t l feel indifferent 
yet my head is clear 
a man who can t
love me physically   
is a pit of misfortune 
a gulf of suffering 
they say that a man
who screws a woman  honors her 
the expression
is worth noting  lt s true 
paul dishonors me 
do you mind 
on the contrary 
just came for a nightcap 
l just got out of bed 
lt s true 
l just got dressed 
l can t stand sleeping 
so l got up 
l don t give a damn about time 
l m never tired 
l hate people who feign fatigue 
who have endless pretexts 
you agree 
lt s because they lack passion 
you live alone 
no  l have a husband 
l told him l had a husband   
so he d know l m not free 
because l m not free 
he ll have to realize
it s adultery 
he s asleep 
sleeping doesn t bother him at all 
he has to get up early tomorrow 
he has a business appointment
in deauville at noon 
do you have a girlfriend 
she died in a car accident 
l haven t made love in 4 months 
maybe all men are like that 
my husband s nice 
but he s not interested in sex 
the first moves
are what l like best 
lt s delicious 
l can never stop
myself from yielding 
lt surprises me each time 
l watch myself giving in
as if it wasn t me 
frankly   
l wanted another taste of that miracle 
a stranger making love to you 
lt s a childish desire   
a pure desire 
give me a blow job 
not now 
this evening or tomorrow 
give me your phone number 
  you don t feel like it 
  to blow you 
not really 
lt s not my specialty 
l don t like
to start with that   
l d rather resume that way 
if you see what l mean 
but going to a hotel 
l m dying to do that 
now l have to split 
in fact  right away 
don t want to go to a hotel 
l have to go to work 
and l have to return the car 
lt s not mine 
will you call me 
sorry l m late 
doesn t matter 
l took attendance 
take out your grammar notebooks 
and write today s date 
last week we did the present
tense of the verb   to be   
  l am  you are  he is     
  we are  you are  they are   
today  we ll do    to have   
  to have   isn t like   to be   
one can   be   without   having   
one can   have   without   being   
l ve been   had   
l ve really been had 
l wish you were pregnant 
fat chance of that 
why 
lt could happen 
how  by the holy ghost 
you dreaming 
there s no way 
ever since l stopped the pill 
you hate details 
but there are dates 
lf you hardly ever do it  and can t
on the right days  it ll never happen 
that s what depresses me 
that s different 
lf you say it s chore time 
l ll do it 
  really 
  yes 
that d change everything 
lf we had a child 
it d make sense to be together 
lt s because
you ve lost faith 
lt ll come back 
lt s like the circean myth 
you want to know the future 
and the past 
you even mess with the present 
you force it 
you ve lost faith 
so everything collapses 
what if l left 
and didn t phone
for 2 weeks or a month 
or 6 months 
would we be through 
depends 
lf you go to the north pole 
or to a desert  maybe 
but if you see a phone
and always say   
  l won t call that dumb girl     
and hang out in every bar
in my neighborhood 
l d say we ve broken up 
l talk of freedom 
you talk of bars 
lt s statistics 
a guy needs to remake
the world with his pals in a bar 
or he dies 
you know l don t cheat on you 
maybe l d rather you did 
and also screwed me 
anyway  l can cheat on you 
but you can t on me 
you already done it 
you talk about it a lot 
no 
but you deserve to think l have 
ok 
tomorrow night 
l m dining with ashley 
you can come 
but you know what l d prefer 
that l didn t come 
l know l should
let him live   
but l need to cling
to him like a leech 
because l m madly
in love with him 
what he calls breathing 
suffocates me 
l never asked to be free 
and l don t want
him to be  either 
l m a real stickler
for absolutes 
and l think l m right 
but when l apply it to life   
it really makes me go schizo 
he dances because
he wants to seduce 
he wants to seduce
because he wants to conquer 
he wants to conquer
because he s a man 
now what is it 
you make a scene
 cause l dance with a girl 
not a girl  some bimbo 
who gives a fuck about her 
then don t give a fuck 
l won t have
a kid with anyone else 
you insist l wear one 
l haven t screwed in 6 months 
l don t have alds 
you re getting better 
you seem to enjoy it 
you re almost triumphant 
you want me to watch
you slip on your condom 
at first you hid 
  think so 
  l do 
l didn t dare look 
l don t like looking at a cock 
once they ve been used 
they re revolting 
not very pretty 
they are rather disgusting 
lt s like a tampax  to screw 
you take it out discreetly 
hide it under the bed 
so the guy s not turned off 
guys are easily disgusted 
later  you have to retrieve it 
l quite like disgusting things 
know why most guys
can t use a condom 
their cocks
aren t hard enough 
as they say  the rubber 
rubs them out 
l wouldn t know 
l don t sleep with guys 
lt s true 
they go limp all the time 
because they re
not really horny 
lt s like in porn flicks   
girls stuff limp cocks
in their mouths 
they have to give blow jobs
because they re not really wanted 
a guy should
take you without a word
but he shouldn t bug
you with his inadequacy 
sometimes a blow job is fine 
lt s ok when the guy
could screw you  but won t 
that s the tantalus torture 
lt makes you admit
you can do that   
or even worse   
as long as he
ends up screwing you 
most guys have cocks
that are short  thin   
and pointed 
pointed 
like a dog s cock 
l hate that 
length isn t everything 
there s the base 
a thin cock isn t noble 
shall l stick it in your ass 
not yet 
screw me some more 
l haven t had enough 
my boyfriend doesn t screw me 
how can you love a guy
who doesn t screw you 
l don t like the guys
who screw me 
l hate them 
l don t want to see
the men who screw me 
or look at them 
l want to be a hole 
a pit   
the more gaping 
the more obscene it is 
the more it s me 
my intimacy 
the more l surrender 
lt s metaphysical 
l disappear in proportion
to the cock taking me 
l hollow myself 
that s my purity 
you like your back
being tickled 
no  l don t like tenderness 
or to be kissed on the mouth 
l couldn t stand that 
l don t care
who stuffs my cunt 
but l can t kiss
someone l don t love 
lt s too intimate 
but l kissed paolo 
l felt like it 
when l kissed him 
l stopped thinking about paul 
so l decided
to stop seeing him 
lt was a question of integrity 
what are you doing 
nothing 
l have a class 
you like my cock 
  l like its smell 
  you re disgusting 
no  it smells good 
l like it that
it s not too large 
lt fits in my hand
and fits in my mouth 
why do you like it 
lt s mine 
l don t know   
lt s like a bird 
feels like l have
a bird in my hand 
you see when
you move like that   
lt s as if it wanted
to fly away 
but it doesn t 
that s touching 
you mind that we don t
go all the way 
what l mind is you won t
let me caress you 
l really resent that 
l do let you caress me 
but not all the way 
don t worry 
l don t come either 
dlctatlon
  winter months   
  everyone had settled   
for a life   
that was dull   
and orderly   
period 
  then suddenly   
comma   
  light   
burst forth   
once again   
period 
  spring   
had come   
exclamation point 
l know 
my spelling is awful 
how did l pass
my teaching exams 
or get my driver s license 
l can t parallel park 
that s less serious 
you re not behind me
when l m double parked 
l think l m dis   lex   
dis   lexic 
like with math 
my reasoning was fine 
but l couldn t learn
multiplication tables 
that s a problem 
nice place 
surprises you  eh 
lt s small 
but it has everything 
girls want to see
what they ve seen on tv 
sliding japanese screens are in 
so that s what l have 
jacuzzis are in 
so l ve got one 
for a small place 
it has everything  it s a theater 
lt s like a stage
where l can rehearse 
l m a high class bum
who s not handsome 
yet l ve had
over 10 000 women 
why me 
because you have
to talk to them 
nobody bothers to talk
to women anymore 
l talk  they listen 
they re in the palm of my hand 
then l put my hand
in the right place without asking 
so it goes 
somebody has
to get things going 
the only way
to be loved by women   
is via rape 
women yield to a stranger 
but play hard to get
with a wretch who loves them 
so it goes 
but do they want
to be respected 
ln a sense  yes 
but respect
is in the nature of things 
since they re up for grabs 
they want to be taken 
l ve had 10 000 women 
l don t remember them all 
but l kept their names  their age 
and the circumstances 
their cunts 
no two are alike 
they re as memorable as faces 
but take ten men 
cut off their cocks 
put them in a basket 
no one can tell his own 
l did a radio show 
they wanted
proof of my statistics 
yes  indeed 
they counted them 
dr  weil  a psychiatrist
and sexologist 
knows a true casanova 
a super don juan 
a prince among seducers 
why does she call me
a prince of seducers 
lt s absurd 
l never seduced anyone 
any woman 
l know
l m not very handsome 
l may even be revolting 
but the fact is 
l ve had 10 000 women 
several per day 
l ve been a seducer
in the sense of   se aductere     
to draw to one s self 
we checked him out 
he kept a record of his conquests 
l ve got something
that will interest you 
l bought it  knowing some day
l d make you read it 
here it is 
read me this sentence 
one shouldn t lend books 
women should read to us 
so we know they ve read it 
l hate reading 
read it 
women must read to us 
  as the mother begets the son 
the son begets the mother 
his act is the creative
counterpoint of the process 
by begetting the mother 
he purifies her 
he purifies her
and himself  uno acto 
he turns the   babylonian whore  
into a virgin   
you re making me shy 
what s come over me 
yet you re the one who   
l m fine 
you see 
l see nothing 
you re posing 
l m being myself 
this kind of embarrassment   
l m perfectly natural 
ls desire 
lt s part of the game 
lf we didn t lack words
when it comes to acts 
we d instantly tell them 
  hands off  
that s what this is 
a trivial relationship 
a very shameful one 
why do men who disgust us
understand us better
than those who appeal to us 
there s a hole in your spelling 
yet  you re a teacher 
yes  a hole 
there 
you re amazed that
l m fingering your pussy 
but it s me doing it 
l m not aroused yet 
but you are   
you re amazed it s me 
so it goes 
beautiful women
get taken by ugly men 
that s a well kept secret 
there has to be action 
the action isn t between man
and woman  that s too simple 
lt s between
beauty and ugliness 
beauty feeds on degradation 
communes with it 
that s where l come in 
l make the most of it 
so it goes 
don t blame me 
shall l dominate you 
open your eyes 
shall l gag you 
lt implies going further   
than it s reasonable
for a woman to accept 
she may have to go beyond
what she agreed to 
you don t yearn
for what you can t accept 
physical love is triviality
clashing with the divine 
lt s strange   
obscenity doesn t bother women 
ls it too painful 
take it off 
l can t stand it 
l didn t realize 
you should ve told me 
l thought l could go far with you 
l can tie you up less severely 
or we can make love normally 
l m ok 
lt s me 
my problem is   
you know   
nobody ever tied me up before 
l never did it 
really  you never did 
l always wanted to 
we ll resume 
l won t tie you as tightly 
no 
lt s fine 
lt has to be this way 
really 
was it good for you  too 
for me it was very beautiful 
truly beautiful 
l want to give you pleasure 
when you cry  l panic 
l feel l ve done
something wrong 
no  it s fine 
at first   
you feel your hands going numb 
you think you can stand it   
then suddenly it s unbearable 
a form of dying   
a galloping death 
you think your
hands will fall off   
you slowly turn
into dead flesh   
and then   
it has to stop at once 
it can t last a second more 
l was afraid you couldn t hear
because of the gag 
lt s really freaky 
but you liked the gag 
l don t like
having to say things 
when l got home 
paul wasn t there 
that made my world
fall apart 
lt has nothing to do
with what l did 
what s done is done 
lt s behind me 
my head is very clear 
lt s all l can be   
in my head 
l feel my body
doesn t belong to me 
lt s an anonymous appendix 
ln my head  there s paul 
he could have reconciled me
with my body 
but he didn t want to do that 
because l don t like my body 
l was an easy prey 
l mean  a victim 
anyway  women are the victims
men need for atonement 
l always masturbate
with my legs closed 
l rarely part them 
l can offer myself to myself 
rape myself 
lt s mildly satisfying 
a bit nauseating 
but it s proof l don t need a man
if l have to resort to this 
lt was painful for me
to be on his bed 
a pain you could call
feeling like lost luggage 
the more time went by 
the less l could bear it 
l had to cast myself out
like a wreck 
ln the basic meaning of the word 
up for grabs 
the only thing l told myself 
like a two bit equation 
was that if l d cheated on him 
and still only loved him 
it didn t much matter
if he d cheated on me 
but he hadn t  lt was worse 
he was thrilled to be alone 
love between men and women 
let it be said again 
is a devious conflict 
there   
l win if l m last to get home 
l know it 
l ll have an edge on him 
 20  just to eat you 
that s my dream 
to know that for some guy 
l m just a pussy he wants to stuff 
without sentimental bullshit 
just raw desire 
to be taken by a guy 
anyone  a nobody 
a bum with whom you wallow
for the joy of wallowing 
for the dishonor 
the discredit 
that s pleasure to a girl 
turn over 
show me your rosebud 
pay me 
you ve got no choice  bitch 
  you like me 
  slut 
whore  bitch 
l reamed you good 
l m not ashamed 
asshole 
ls nymphomania
destroying yourself   
because you choose a man
who doesn t love you 
l don t want
to sleep with men 
l want to be opened up
all the way 
when you can see that the mystique
is a load of innards 
the woman is dead 
maybe l really want to meet
  jack the ripper  
he d certainly dissect
a woman like me 
once again l hung around an hour
so l d be the last to get home 
that s proof that women are capable
of more love than men 
much more love 
he s waiting for me  too 
when l get home after him 
it s not as easy 
the little guy s edgy 
  l just got home 
  me  too 
so l see 
but l just got home  too 
sure  you wouldn t watch
the idiot box for an hour 
  a love affair deals
with an older man s obsession
for a young prostitute   
so he won t screw me 
  maybe due to his education 
women always
seemed strange to him 
he preferred the company
of his friends 
women were from another world 
somewhat superior   
my cunt is swollen and moist 
l can hold out forever 
he won t beat me down this way 
when he wants an evening
without me   
l make the most of it 
l get tied up 
lt s his fault 
shall l dominate you 
want to tie me up 
today  you choose 
l don t want to do anything 
you like being tied up 
yes  but not my elbows 
last time  my hands
were numb for 2 weeks 
a month ago 
one elbow still felt weird 
that s abnormal 
you ve got bad circulation 
one day in cannes 
l picked up grace delly 
lf l d known it was her 
l wouldn t have dared 
but she liked me and made a date
to meet at my place 
she rang 
blonde  impeccable hairdo 
in a hound s tooth tailleur 
a bitch for a hound dog 
l screw her  love in the afternoon 
she leaves in fine spirits 
next day l see her 
l was with a friend 
l tell him
l screwed that woman 
he says 
  you screwed grace delly   
l looked at him 
l didn t know 
see  l m not handsome   
or wealthy or attractive 
but l screwed her 
later  l went over to her   
we have a drink   
and l ask her  why 
  why didn t you say
you were grace delly   
  would you have behaved
the same way   
l guess not 
you don t act the same way
with grace delly 
you wear kid gloves 
what a pity 
that was nice 
wait 
this doesn t hurt 
too bad 
l don t have two 
doesn t matter   
l ll do it this way 
there  raise your ass 
l ll lift your skirt 
like that 
l ll spread your legs  ok 
l think you like it
when l spread your legs 
  wait 
  l love it 
there 
that s nice 
now l ll put this on 
wait 
help me 
that s beautiful 
you re lovely like that 
lt s beautiful 
now l ll gag you 
l enjoyed it so much 
l grew attached to robert 
tying me up without tying me down 
was the secret of his ritual 
after these sessions
l wasn t gloomy  we giggled 
we partied and overate 
the guy was flat broke 
so she said to him   
you want more caviar 
more caviar 
waiter  please 
more caviar 
and vodka 
l love to tipple 
but l never get drunk 
or what they call drunk 
can we have
some more vodka  too 
you seem fine 
you see your pals 
me  my girlfriends 
l bet you badmouth us 
we badmouth you 
we do  we don t 
help me 
caress me 
l can t  you kept it on 
lf that s all it takes 
love is dumb 
lt s just a power trip 
a guy you re faithful to 
won t screw you 
cheat on him 
and he screws you 
they don t guess you re cheating   
they sense you re getting away 
my fists are closed 
l can t do a thing 
now what 
what s this act 
why can t you see
l only do this with you 
l ve never touched
anyone s cock 
then why won t you
leave me alone 
because you do nothing 
now   
you be me 
you be the woman 
l ll be your guy  l ll screw you 
can you believe it 
that s how that selfish bastard
got me pregnant 
nobody came 
not even him 
he did a virgin mary stunt on me 
with a drop of seminal fluid 
let your legs fall 
relax  there 
the neck is closed  good 
the uterus is   
lt s been 8 weeks 
your turn 
that s how l became a case study
for pimply interns 
a slab of meat 
once you re pregnant 
they spread your legs
and peer all the way
up your vagina 
then l took
a bitter liking to it 
as l d made a truce with robert
while l was pregnant 
nobody else touched me 
my only sexual relationships
became my monthly visits 
l m uneasy on an exam table 
l resent spreading my legs 
that s why it affects me 
l m a bit of an ice maiden 
l see why the chinese used
an ivory replica to probe your body 
though even that s distasteful 
porn movies  too  protect your libido 
you watch a surrogate image 
but what you can t tolerate 
you can t tolerate in images  either 
an image  is just as compromising 
since it stands for you 
very good 
paul is right 
you can t love a face
if a cunt goes with it 
a cunt doesn t go with a face 
l fantasize about a brothel   
where a head
is separated from a body 
by a guillotine like contraption
before the blade comes down 
of course  there s no blade 
l wear a silky red skirt
that billows up and rustles 
and those silly trappings
that give men a hard on 
lt s proof a hard on
doesn t mean they love us 
paul is right  being a woman
has a fatal flaw 
lf she gets you hard 
you want to bone her 
wanting to bone her
is to despise her 
love between men and women
is impossible 
men you can t see 
you imagine coarse and ape like 
aziz  look at my cock 
as if crudeness
is all one can expect 
there we see the head   
that was the spine 
the thigh bone 
want to know what it is 
lt s a boy 
fabulous 
you want me to marry you 
yes 
that night  paul made love to me
for the first time in ages 
and for the last time 
from then on he lugged me around
like a ball and chain 
a duty he had to endure 
we went out every evening   
with his sister and brother in law 
now that l was
the mother of his son 
l d met his whole family 
you ok 
two whiskies 
  you ok 
  fine 
want another drink 
later 
please don t make a scene 
no scene 
l felt like dancing 
so l grabbed a girl 
l almost kissed her 
she was so hot for me 
then l dumped her
where l picked her up 
she never knew what happened 
so you can t complain 
l didn t 
but secretly you do 
a whisky  please 
you two quit loving each other 
you hold her like a deadbeat 
sit down 
not too tired 
l m fine 
she s my sister 
but l ll tell her 
that a man likes a challenge 
he hates being followed around 
he needs to fear
he may lose her 
then he chases her 
or chases someone else 
a man s always chasing 
you agree 
you and your chasing s a bore 
the bastard 
he leaves me alone
with my anxiety   
that soon my vagina will expand
and expel the baby 
wake up 
l m sick of your boozing 
you slob 
you dumb male model 
be right down 
what s going on 
you ll like it 
get on the table 
wait for the contraction to pass 
breathe deeply 
breathe 
once it s over  get on the table 
  no  the father can t stay 
  yes  he can 
am l getting an epidural 
lt s too late 
your baby s being born 
ready  we re going to
push out the baby 
lnhale 
lnhale  hold your breath 
grab the bar 
push hard  again 
with all your might 
hold your breath  more 
lt s incredible to create life 
lnhale 
hold your breath and push 
go on 
they say a woman isn t a woman
till she s a mother 
lt s true 
nothing that happened before
really matters
