thats it
what the fuck
most people dont know
what an alderman does
including a fair number
of aldermen
it comes from the old english
meaning older man
when i was a younger man
facebook
back then
a face was something
you tried never to forget
a book
a book was something you read
to your son my son jack
stand up jack stand up
my son
the best candidate for
alderman of the 18th ward
hes your man believe me
what you cant speak
yo could i get
a piece of that
gotta get a loan player
i got good credit
whats up
whatever
mr mulligan
mr manning
hmm
my aide siobhan
this is my brother
jatemme
i love you too
as a kid i used to help out
with my dads campaign
it looked a lot like this
except a little whiter
i imagine
yeah
mind
please do
my father always thought
it was a good idea
to keep the lines
of communication
open with his opponent
keep things honest dignified
maybe he could be
more honest and open
about whatever deal he made
with the city council
to call this special election
instead of waiting
until february
like the law says
he had to step down
he had a heart attack
who does waiting serve
everyone whos
not named mulligan
first time
ive run for office
im already ahead of you
by 12 points in the polls
the mulligans have run
the 18th ward for 60 years
my grandfather my father
these days its
all about name recognition
you wanna go against me
you dont inherit
a ward jack
you run for it
you have much experience
in government
i live here
so do i
no no no
you uh own a house one block
into the ward
a house people might actually
want to live in
its a smart idea
running headquarters
from a church
i mean its illegal
theres that whole
church and state thing
more illegal than nepotism
nepotism isnt illegal
its actually celebrated
this is chicago
your daddy can put you
on some commission
where people
dont have no say
let you be a big boy
play with a few trains but
extending the green line
is the best thing
for the people
of the 18th ward
brings them closer to jobs
closer to culture
those people
dont seem to be the ones
getting rich though jack
what about you jamal
what have you been doing
to improve the lives
of the people of chicago
i bet your reputations
a real problem
for your communications team
maybe you the one who need
the communications team
ive never been arrested
lets see if you can say that
a few months from now
if you pull out now
you can save yourself
some money
ton of embarrassment
come on jack
i dont pull out
when it feels this good
right
all right dont forget
to vote on august 8th
absolutely hey the election
is on the 7th jack
oh i know
why you wanna go
into politics anyway man
passing bills and shit
whatever the fuck they do
alderman of this ward
makes a 104000 a year
shit we make
more than that in a week
but then you add in
the juice right
he gives his friend
a contract
for a new building
gets a kickback
gives his brother a contract
for construction
hell he give his mama
a contract for construction
that man owns a piece
of every fucking thing
the only people
coming after him
they got cameras
and microphones
people coming after us
with guns
im 37 years old jatemme
i dont want this life no more
i want his fucking life
harry rawlings is dead
what that
gotta do with us
hey what
he took
our money with him
medical examiner
say he can still id them
i think off the teeth maybe
i always said
he should burn in hell
but hey chicagoll do
he who admonishes
the young to live well
and the old to make good end
speaks foolishly
not merely because of
the desirability of life
but because
the same exercise at once
teaches us to live well
and to die well
much worse is he who says
that it were good
not to be born
but once one is born
to pass with all speed
through the gates of hades
he was
so beautiful wasnt he
his eyes he got away with
so much because of those eyes
i know i know
because they
didnt let me see the body
i couldnt say goodbye
properly ma
i wanna see it
i promise you alitzia
you dont wanna see his body
whats left of it
would you like something to eat
something to drink then
i dont want anything from you
youre the reason im here
and carlos isnt
he got into the life on his own
he did if for you
before you he was going to college
his blood is on your hands
what do you think
of my new painting
what
the artist
is really blowing up
i got in early
got it for 50000 drink
yeah
to the masterpiece
yeah so
did you get him to concede
go back to his
normal business
now let me
tell you something
i dont wanna see you
become the first mulligan
to lose to a nigger
especially this guy
hes tricky
okay
hes staying in
but its fine
okay
yeah its dealt with
thanks thanks a lot
dealt with what do you mean

maybe you shouldnt have been
such a hardass
now if youd have
just rolled over
for the mayor
on that housing development
i dont roll over for anybody
okay
he had his agenda i had mine
look where thats got us
the lines of the ward
are redrawn
and were down 7000 votes
that wouldve gone our way
you created this problem
now we might be left
without a pot to piss in

piece of wallpaper
its art

the night
that harry died do you
they laughed

this is not your store
i have a lease
i pay that shit every month
you gave that money to carlos
and he spent it all at arlington
until the money ran out
and he couldnt keep up
then he started
paying it to us
then he fell behind
then he gave us the store
or to be fair we took it
its like this
carlos doesnt own it
you dont own it
its a system
fuck your system
thats my money
maybe im
not explaining this clearly
ask carlos
hes dead
condolences

mrs rawlings
i wanted to say that uh
you dont have to keep me
hanging around
the way that harry did if you
dont want you can hire
someone else if you want
i cant afford to hire
someone else bash
i cant even afford to keep you
you dont have to worry
i can always get a job working
security at a bar parttime
what if you keep the car
this car
yeah you drive me around
you get me back on my feet
and you keep the car
where do you wanna go
the people i know
are never gonna pay you
for a notebook mrs rawlings
so lets pretend
you just came down here
to refill harrys flask
and have a drink
what if i told you that
harry owed a lot of money
and now those people
want it from me
and what if i told you
a construction accident
didnt put me in this chair
a debt did
this is not your world
use that notebook
to settle the debt
they might take it
its what harry
would have wanted
render unto caesar
what is caesars
mrs rawlings
albert woodfox
organized a chapter
of the black panther party
in angola prison
then spent 44 years
in solitary
yeah i dont know
if i have the adequate words
to describe what its like
to be in a state
of where nothing you do
is gonna change
your situation
i went almost 20 years
without any
disciplinary reports
it made no difference
when i went
before the review board
no matter how much
you change
it makes no difference
bash
i need those names
yes maam
oh my god
it smells like a dead rat
i think i should get a job
as what
a house cleaner
serve coffee
why would you ever do that
what else am i gonna do
i went from your home
to floreks home
men are supposed
to provide for you
where did all the money go
i told you ma we spent it
wanted me to have a nice life
how much did you
get for your things
three thousand
what about the bike
gave it to floreks friend
what am i gonna do
with a bike
you idiot
you never ask for enough
why i should be like you
and ask for everything
like i deserve it
drive my husband
in the ground
take care of myself
before my children
im sorry mama
i just dont know what to do
such
a beautiful girl i made
i wanna show you something
its an arrangement site
alitzia
these girls are smart
they go out one night a week
and make as much
as theyd make
in a month at a 7eleven
on top of that
if youre sweet
like you
they get bonuses
they get jewelry
they get treated
like a princess
and they go to college
thats what i want for you
sweetheart
is that so wrong
im not gonna sleep
with men i dont know
that aint my life
what do you mean by that
who the fuck do you

you forget whose roof
you slept under
when you were 16 17 15
so dont act like youre
the fucking virgin mary
those boys didnt pay me
everybody
thanks for coming today
today we are
standing on a vacant lot
but tomorrow
thanks to mwow
the minority women owned work
initiative my father started
this will be
a thriving business
owned and operated
by the women of this ward
and it is my dream
to continue that amazing work
that my father began
because this
is the 14th business
that has opened
in the past three years
as long as there is
a mulligan in office
there will be 14 more
in my first term i promise
now can i get an mwow
mwow
can i get an mwow
mwow
all right all right
now where are my uh
where are my success stories
yes
we got some success stories
come on
mr mulligan
we want to talk about
the audit that just came out
come on up
all right lets
perhaps some
of your constituents
will be interested
to hear about it
these women they arent just
in business for themselves
theyre in business
for the whole community
over a million dollars
they have generated
in the past three years
thats money that goes back
into the community
its money that stays here
in the 18th ward
mr mulligan
an audit by the cook county
comptroller
shows over five million
dollars in overages
all right here we go
from the proposed
extension of the green line
mwow
during that time you were
head of the ctas commission
congratulations
a position
you were appointed to
by your father
do you care to comment on the
contracts you awarded while
serving on the commission
mr mcroberts sorry
ill see you all on the 7th
thank you for coming out
come on jack
give me a quote i can use
what about the contracts
you awarded
while serving
on the commission
all right thats uh
what about
the proposed extension
of the green line
thats enough questions
thank you
the green line
should serve
the people of this ward
now it can bring customers
to business like this
and at the end of the day it
can take tired workers home
without that kind
of infrastructure
mwow is just another
empty gesture doomed to fail
you asked me about my father
my father taught me
about this neighborhood
he taught me
to empower the very people
that this city has
overlooked for so long
but ill see you 18th
and ill make sure
the rest of chicago does too
thank you
end fucking quote
that fucking
scumbag mcroberts
wont he ever just give up
hes been shit on the sole
of my familys shoes forever
i wouldnt worry
about mcroberts
id be more worried
about the numbers
your friend jamals no joke
fucking jamal
tell me have you ever slept
with a black guy
im sorry
you heard me
have you ever slept
with a black guy
what does that have
to do with jamal or anything
just answer
the fucking question
we are in a situation
where you could lose everything
youve got the igs office
and the feds
breathing down your neck
you got jamal manning
climbing in the polls
and all youre concerned with
is whether or not
your dick is bigger than his
what are we
fighting for this
you know how many
shootings happened
in this city
last weekend alone
thirtyfour these people
are killing each other
this is not where
i wanna raise my children
what are we
fighting for exactly
i feel suffocated
im not a mulligan
im my mothers son
god rest her soul
the shit she had to put up
with from my father
im putting up with it too
thats what adults do jack
i never wanted to be
in this fucking business
and thats all this is
its a fucking business
christ i just wanna
be free of this shit
cant take it anymore
i just
wake the fuck up jack
you are not going
to pussy out now
what are you gonna do
work in a bank
take the train downtown
punch a clock
this is your life
this is our life
its what we do
everyone has
a fucking sob story
most of them better than yours
so if the idea is to be
mayor one day
youd better man the fuck up
jesus
dollar signs
and empty promises
anybody who thinks different
are fooling themselves
its the gods honest truth
thanks john

our husbands

now ill be there tomorrow
i hope to see you there
so what has
happened in the world
that normal now
passes as excellence
when did we lower
our standards
there seems to be
no expectation
to go above and beyond
what one might know
yeah yes sir
or might want to know
it seems people are blissful
in their own ignorance
how far have we fallen
indeed how far have we fallen
we are living in an environment
where people are blind
what you dont see
you dont know
out of sight out of mind
so now ignorance
is the new normal
in fact ignorance
ignorance is the new excellence
the less you know
the more seemingly you gain
not to care is deemed
to be smart
when you subtract
love from any equation
from any situation
from any location
the result is always hurt
and pain on all sides
that is why
we need to bring love
back into the equation
love
in jesus words
thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself
so he can hear you on high
say it with me
thou shalt love thy neighbor
as thyself
amen
even when it aint easy
even when
youve been done wrong
when this worlds got you down
on your knees
love thy neighbor as thyself
all right amen
noel how are you my brother

or ill fucking whip your ass
today

okay
jfk huh
you think youre gonna
make things better
theyre not gonna be any better
you think youre gonna change
things change them to what

change anything
theyll never change
under you
the only thing that matters
is that we survive
thats all
look around you
its like custers last stand
its kill or be killed
now listen to me son
listen we made this city
were not having it
taken away from us
by people
who come here illegally
or by people who cant stop
you know
making babies
that means staying in power
at all costs you got that
yeah
you listen to me father
im looking forward to the day
when all this bullshit is over
and i dont have to talk
to people like you
because
because you wont be
here anymore
my son
boy
you finished
yeah
okay
now hear me
tell your redheaded
paperweight here
to call hillsman
and hire him back
okay
hes gonna make this
gavin whatever whoever
your debate prep consultant
you need to pick up your toys
put them back in the box
when youre done we will
continue this conversation
eh
get the door
my jacket
who are you
im veronica rawlings
we met a long time ago
when i was lobbying
for the teachers union
i hope you can teach my son
better than i did
mrs rawlings i dont think
youre on my schedule today
im not sure
i have the time to sit
you do you absolutely do
shes from the teachers
union all right
yeah lets go
were leaving okay
sorry to interrupt
mr mulligan
yeah
taking the car to the garage
ill be back in a few hours
sure john just see
siobhan before you leave
mrs rawlings please come in
hmm
i know that guy
seen him at the salon
when was the last
time you saw my husband
before he died
it was a while
i cant remember
why do you ask
jamal manning threatened me
he says harry stole from him
and he presented me
with the bill
he wants his money
im not sure i follow
from what i understand
we both have
a jamal manning problem
you dont
you dont live in my ward
mrs rawlings
but if youre aware of a crime
you should really
go to the police
mr mulligan you said
whenever i needed help
now your familys been involved
in harrys life for many years
when i say help
i mean help
i understand but
im not my father
as you can see the years
have taken a toll on him
and i do not want to go down
that same road
so with much
admiration and respect
for your late husband
and yourself of course
i dont see what i can do
what ive learned
from men like my father
and harry
is that you reap what you sow
lets hope so
that guy who was here
in the suit who is he
i told you i dont want you
to get involved
what do you mean
he works for someone
so who really owns this salon
how is that
any of your business
what doesnt bother you
doesnt trouble you
mmhmm
jack mulligan
he empowered me
i am a female minority
business owner
but the powers that be
take a very healthy cut
so why do you stand for it
where exactly would you
like me to stand
i needed money
to start a business
he gave it to me
and now i owe him
no bank was gonna give me
any money he did
all i wanted to do was
have a business of my own
and this way im allowed
to think i have one
does that sound right to you
because it doesnt sound right
to me
you got a customer
right over there
two of the three
cameras at the back
are covered
by the construction
mmhmm
and what about
the codes for the safe room
veronicas on it
why isnt she here
why are we
doing this by ourselves
i dont know
why are we doing this anyway
wait whos
watching your kids
my mom
so while you were
sitting her kids
your mom was
watching your daughter
i work two jobs
what do you do for money
i had florek
i had a business
did you know
what they did
i thought i did
if i asked hed hit me
after a job though
he was nice
what about veronica
you think she knew
i bet
she knew everything
you girls
happy to split your cut
what about this you
vouch for her
shed be a lot nicer if she
just took that stick
out of her ass
you know why
we need a new driver
the last one was killed
so if youre not serious
if this whole thing
goes wrong
i just want my kids to know
that i didnt sit there
and take it
i did something
our go date
is in three days
the night of the debate
now all of our work
is worth nothing
if we dont move
this money and fast
the notebook says
five million dollars
thats exactly
the amount of money
mulligan was accused of taking
in commission kickbacks
so over here we have
two million dollars
twenty tupperware boxes
each box has 100000 dollars
in 100dollar bills
it weighs 44 pounds
now over here we have
two million dollars
forty tupperware boxes
each box has 50000 dollars
in 50dollar bills
it weighs 88 pounds
i feel like im in school
tell me about it
okay linda
that bag has the weight of
two million dollars
in hundreddollar bills
put it on
all right
run to the back
of that van and back
this is nothing
all that for this
now belle
that was easy
put that on
watch you back
bend your knees
okay run to the back
of the van and back
come on come on
its not funny now is it
and it wont be
if we get caught
come on come on
come on come on run
get this thing
off of me
now that bag had double
the weight of before
why the fuck
would you do that
because i had to think
of the bestcase scenario
and the worstcase scenario
we gotta move fast
we gotta start thinking
like professionals
were in business together
theres not gonna be
some cozy reunion
after this job were done
we have three days to look
and move like a team of men
the best thing we have going
for us is being who we are
why
because no one thinks we have
the balls to pull this off
can i ask you a question
as long as i can answer it
and still get to my meeting
how come we
never go to your place
my place
thats your question
id like to see how you live
i could cook you dinner
we could watch some tv

or be proud of
mine to fuck up or make good

muted celebrations
in the mulligan camp
as tuesdays
election results sink in
in a late rally
there was a resounding
victory for jack mulligan
seen as a sympathy vote
following the murder
of alderman tom mulligan
reverend john wheeler
was outside
the mulligan residence
this morning
to talk to reporters
brothers and sisters
we ask that you keep
jack mulligan in your prayers
as he tries to find
the strength with gods help
to begin his term of office
and to continue
the program of change
initiated by
his beloved father
i know you remember
all the good work
the mulligans have done
