come on 
that s it 
what the fuck 
most people don t know
what an alderman does   
including a fair number
of aldermen 
it comes from the old english 
meaning  older man  
when i was a younger man 
facebook   
back then 
a face was something
you tried never to forget 
a book 
a book was something you read
to your son  my son  jack 
stand up  jack  stand up 
my son 
the best candidate for
alderman of the 18th ward 
he s your man  believe me 
what  you can t speak 
yo  could i get
a piece of that 
gotta get a loan  player 
i got good credit 
what s up 
whatever 
mr  mulligan 
  mr  manning 
  hmm 
my aide  siobhan 
  this is my brother 
  jatemme 
i love you  too 
as a kid  i used to help out
with my dad s campaign 
it looked a lot like this 
except a little whiter 
  i imagine 
  yeah 
  mind 
  please do 
my father always thought
it was a good idea
to keep the lines
of communication
open with his opponent 
keep things honest  dignified 
maybe he could be
more honest and open
about whatever deal he made
with the city council
to call this special election
instead of waiting
until february
like the law says 
he had to step down 
he had a heart attack 
who does waiting serve 
everyone who s
not named mulligan 
first time
i ve run for office 
i m already ahead of you
by 12 points in the polls 
the mulligans have run
the 18th ward for 60 years 
my grandfather  my father 
these days it s
all about name recognition 
you wanna go against me 
you don t inherit
a ward  jack 
you run for it 
you have much experience
in government 
  i live here 
  so do i 
no  no  no 
you  uh  own a house one block
into the ward 
a house people might actually
want to live in 
it s a smart idea 
running headquarters
from a church 
i mean  it s illegal 
there s that whole
church and state thing 
more illegal than nepotism 
nepotism isn t illegal 
it s actually celebrated 
this is chicago 
your daddy can put you
on some commission
where people
don t have no say 
let you be a big boy 
play with a few trains  but   
extending the green line
is the best thing
for the people
of the 18th ward 
brings them closer to jobs 
closer to culture 
those people
don t seem to be the ones
getting rich though  jack 
what about you  jamal 
what have you been doing
to improve the lives
of the people of chicago 
i bet your reputation s
a real problem
for your communications team 
maybe you the one who need
the communications team 
i ve never been arrested 
let s see if you can say that
a few months from now 
if you pull out now 
you can save yourself
some money 
ton of embarrassment 
come on  jack 
i don t pull out
when it feels this good 
right 
all right  don t forget
to vote on august 8th 
absolutely  hey  the election
is on the 7th  jack 
oh  i know 
why you wanna go
into politics anyway  man 
passing bills and shit 
whatever the fuck they do 
alderman of this ward
makes a  104 000 a year 
shit  we make
more than that in a week 
but then you add in
the juice  right 
he gives his friend
a contract
for a new building 
gets a kickback 
gives his brother a contract
for construction 
hell  he give his mama
a contract for construction 
that man owns a piece
of every fucking thing 
the only people
coming after him 
they got cameras
and microphones 
people coming after us
with guns 
i m 37 years old  jatemme 
i don t want this life no more 
i want his fucking life 
harry rawlings is dead 
what that
gotta do with us 
hey  what 
he took
our money with him 
medical examiner
say he can still id them 
i think off the teeth maybe 
i always said
he should burn in hell 
but  hey  chicago ll do 
he who admonishes
the young to live well
and the old to make good end
speaks foolishly 
not merely because of
the desirability of life 
but because
the same exercise at once
teaches us to live well
and to die well 
much worse is he who says
that it were good
not to be born 
but once one is born
to pass with all speed
through the gates of hades 
he was
so beautiful  wasn t he 
his eyes  he got away with
so much because of those eyes 
i know  i know 
because they
didn t let me see the body 
i couldn t say goodbye
properly  ma 
i wanna see it 
i promise you  alitzia 
you don t wanna see his body 
what s left of it 
would you like something to eat 
something to drink  then 
i don t want anything from you 
you re the reason i m here   
and carlos isn t
he got into the life on his own 
he did if for you 
before you  he was going to college 
his blood is on your hands 
what do you think
of my new painting 
what 
the artist
is really blowing up 
i got in early 
got it for 50 000  drink 
yeah 
to the masterpiece 
yeah  so   
did you get him to concede 
go back to his
normal business 
now  let me
tell you something 
i don t wanna see you
become the first mulligan   
to lose to a nigger 
especially this guy 
he s tricky 
okay 
he s staying in 
  but it s fine 
  okay 
yeah  it s dealt with 
thanks  thanks a lot 
dealt with  what do you mean 
 dealt with  
maybe you shouldn t have been
such a hard ass 
now  if you d have
just rolled over
for the mayor
on that housing development   
i don t roll over for anybody 
okay 
  he had his agenda  i had mine 
  look where that s got us 
the lines of the ward

you gave that money to carlos 
and he spent it all at arlington
until the money ran out

it s like this 
carlos doesn t own it

and you keep the car 
where do you wanna go 
the people i know

for a notebook  mrs  rawlings 
so  let s pretend
you just came down here
to refill harry s flask
and have a drink 
what if i told you that
harry owed a lot of money   
and now those people
want it from me 
and what if i told you   
a construction accident
didn t put me in this chair 
a debt did 
this is not your world

would have wanted

of the black panther party
in angola prison 
then spent 44 years
in solitary

to describe what it s like
to be in a state
of where nothing you do
is gonna change
your situation 
i went almost 20 years
without any
disciplinary reports 
it made no difference
when i went
before the review board 
no matter how much
you change 
it makes no difference 
bash 
i need those names 
yes  ma am

everybody 
thanks for coming today 
today  we are
standing on a vacant lot 
but tomorrow 
thanks to mwow 
the minority women owned work
initiative my father started 
this will be
a thriving business 
owned and operated
by the women of this ward 
and it is my dream
to continue that amazing work
that my father began 
because this
is the 14th business
that has opened
in the past three years 
as long as there is
a mulligan in office 
there will be 14 more
in my first term  i promise 
now  can i get an  m wow  
m wow 
can i get an  m wow  
m wow 
  all right  all right 
now  where are my  uh   
  where are my success stories 
  yes 
  we got some success stories 
  come on 
mr  mulligan 
we want to talk about
the audit that just came out 
  come on up 
  all right  let s   
perhaps some
of your constituents
will be interested
to hear about it 
these women  they aren t just
in business for themselves 
they re in business
for the whole community 
over a million dollars
they have generated
in the past three years 
that s money that goes back
into the community 
it s money that stays here 
  in the 18th ward 
  mr  mulligan 
an audit by the cook county
comptroller
shows over five million
dollars in overages   
all right  here we go 
   from the proposed
  extension of the green line 
  m wow 
during that time  you were
head of the cta s commission 
  congratulations 
  a position
you were appointed to
by your father 
do you care to comment on the
contracts you awarded while
  serving on the commission 
  mr  mcroberts  sorry 
i ll see you all on the 7th 
thank you for coming out 
come on  jack 
give me a quote i can use 
what about the contracts
you awarded
while serving
on the commission 
all right  that s  uh   
what about
the proposed extension
  of the green line 
  that s enough questions 
  thank you 
  the green line
should serve
the people of this ward 
now  it can bring customers
to business like this
and at the end of the day  it
can take tired workers home 
without that kind
of infrastructure
mwow is just another
empty gesture doomed to fail 
you asked me about my father 
my father taught me
about this neighborhood 
he taught me
to empower the very people
that this city has
overlooked for so long 
but i ll see you  18th 
and i ll make sure
the rest of chicago does  too 
thank you 
end fucking quote 
that fucking
scumbag mcroberts 
won t he ever just give up 
he s been shit on the sole
of my family s shoes forever 
i wouldn t worry
about mcroberts 
i d be more worried
about the numbers 
your friend jamal s no joke 
fucking jamal   
tell me  have you ever slept
with a black guy 
  i m sorry 
  you heard me 
have you ever slept
with a black guy 
what does that have
to do with jamal  or anything 
just answer
the fucking question 
we are in a situation
where you could lose everything 
you ve got the ig s office
and the feds
breathing down your neck 
you got jamal manning
climbing in the polls 
and all you re concerned with
is whether or not
your dick is bigger than his 
what are we
fighting for  this 
you know how many
shootings happened
in this city
last weekend alone 
thirty four  these people
are killing each other 
this is not where
i wanna raise my children 
what are we
fighting for exactly 
i feel suffocated 
i m not a mulligan 
i m my mother s son 
god rest her soul 
the shit she had to put up
with from my father 
i m putting up with it  too 
that s what adults do  jack 
i never wanted to be
in this fucking business
and that s all this is 
it s a fucking business 
christ  i just wanna
be free of this shit

this is your life 
this is our life 
it s what we do 
everyone has
a fucking sob story 
most of them better than yours 
so  if the idea is to be
mayor one day 
you d better man the fuck up 
jesus 
dollar signs
and empty promises 
anybody who thinks different
are fooling themselves 
it s the god s honest truth 
thanks  john 
fellas 
i can t believe

i have a business proposition 
if you have
a high risk threshold 
listen 
we re in trouble 
it was jamal manning s money
that our husbands stole 
who s that 
somebody you

the money burnt up in the van

we split the rest 
  you want us to

listen  our lives

our husbands
aren t coming back 
we re on our own 
now  i ll be there tomorrow 
i hope to see you there 
so  what has
happened in the world   
that normal now
passes as excellence 
when did we lower
our standards 
there seems to be
no expectation
to go above and beyond
what one might know 
  yeah  yes  sir 
  or might want to know 
it seems people are blissful
in their own ignorance 
how far have we fallen 
indeed  how far have we fallen 
we are living in an environment
where people are blind 
what you don t see 
you don t know 
out of sight  out of mind 
so now ignorance
is the new normal 
in fact  ignorance   
ignorance is the new excellence 
the less you know
the more seemingly you gain 
not to care is deemed
to be smart 
when you subtract
love from any equation 
from any situation 
from any location 
the result is always hurt
and pain on all sides 
that is why
we need to bring love
back into the equation 
love 
in jesus  words 
 thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself  
so he can hear you on high 
say it with me 
 thou shalt love thy neighbor
  as thyself  
  amen 
even when it ain t easy 
even when
you ve been done wrong 
when this world s got you down
on your knees   
love thy neighbor as thyself 
all right  amen 
noel  how are you  my brother 
reverend wheeler

in your ward
and an even larger outreach 
i ve known the mulligans
since i became a pastor

like i said  i know him 
so you re endorsing
the mulligans  can we go now 
i didn t say that 
the ward has been redrawn 
the mulligans
weren t playing ball 
for the first time 
someone like us has a shot 
i d be an idiot to ignore that 
i m gonna cut to the chase
here  reverend 
i m in the driving seat  i just
don t have a set of wheels 
all i need is your endorsement
and your contribution
to help me
get across the finish line 
how much of a contribution
do you need 
and what s it worth to you 
you mean worth
in terms of funding 
i can fill you in on that 
but what matters
is that you re with us 
someone s ears are burning 
gentlemen  let s discuss this
further another time

  we have to now 
  why didn t you ask linda 
  because there is a plan

is to spend less
than what you came with 
it was a good deal

for the teachers  union 
i hope you can teach my son
better than i did 
mrs  rawlings  i don t think
you re on my schedule today 
i m not sure
i have the time to sit 
you do  you absolutely do 
she s from the teachers 
union  all right 
yeah  let s go 
we re leaving  okay 
sorry to interrupt 
  mr  mulligan 
  yeah 
taking the car to the garage 
i ll be back in a few hours 
sure  john  just see
siobhan before you leave 
mrs  rawlings  please come in 
hmm 
i know that guy 
seen him at the salon 
when was the last
time you saw my husband 
before he died 
it was a while 
i can t remember 
why do you ask 
jamal manning threatened me 
he says harry stole from him 
and he presented me
with the bill 
he wants his money 
i m not sure i follow 
from what i understand 
we both have
a jamal manning problem 
you don t   
you don t live in my ward 
mrs  rawlings 
but if you re aware of a crime 
you should really
go to the police 
mr  mulligan  you said
whenever i needed help 
now  your family s been involved
in harry s life for many years 
when i say help   
  i mean help 
  i understand  but   
i m not my father 
as you can see  the years
have taken a toll on him   
and i do not want to go down
that same road 
so with much
admiration and respect
for your late husband
and yourself  of course   
i don t see what i can do 
what i ve learned
from men like my father   
and harry   
is that you reap what you sow 
let s hope so 
that guy who was here 
in the suit  who is he 
i told you  i don t want you
to get involved 
what do you mean 
he works for someone 
so who really owns this salon 
how is that
any of your business 
what doesn t bother you
doesn t trouble you 
mm hmm 
  jack mulligan 
he empowered me 
i am a female minority
business owner 
but the powers that be
take a very healthy cut 
so why do you stand for it 
where exactly would you
like me to stand 
i needed money
to start a business 
he gave it to me 
and now i owe him 
no bank was gonna give me
any money  he did 
all i wanted to do was
have a business of my own
and this way i m allowed
to think i have one 
does that sound right to you 
because it doesn t sound right
  to me 
  you got a customer
right over there 
two of the three
cameras at the back
are covered
by the construction 
mm hmm 
and what about
the codes for the safe room 
veronica s on it 
why isn t she here 
why are we
  doing this by ourselves 
  i don t know 
why are we doing this anyway 
wait  who s
watching your kids 
my mom 
so while you were
sitting her kids 
your mom was
watching your daughter 
i work two jobs 
what do you do for money 
i had florek 
i had a business 
did you know
what they did 
i thought i did 
if i asked  he d hit me 
after a job  though 
he was nice 
what about veronica 
you think she knew 
i bet
she knew everything 
 you girls
happy to split your cut  
what about this   you
vouch for her  
she d be a lot nicer if she
just took that stick
out of her ass 
you know why
we need a new driver 
the last one was killed 
so if you re not serious   
if this whole thing
goes wrong   
i just want my kids to know
that i didn t sit there
and take it 
i did something 
our go date
is in three days 
the night of the debate 
now  all of our work
is worth nothing
if we don t move
this money and fast 
the notebook says
five million dollars 
that s exactly
the amount of money
mulligan was accused of taking
in commission kickbacks 
so over here we have
two million dollars 
twenty tupperware boxes 
each box has 100 000 dollars
in 100 dollar bills 
it weighs 44 pounds 
now  over here we have
two million dollars 
forty tupperware boxes 
each box has 50 000 dollars
in 50 dollar bills 
it weighs 88 pounds 
i feel like i m in school 
  tell me about it 
  okay  linda 
that bag has the weight of
two million dollars
in hundred dollar bills 
put it on 
all right 
run to the back
of that van and back 
this is nothing 
all that for this 
  now  belle   
  that was easy 
put that on 
watch you back 
bend your knees 
okay  run to the back
of the van and back 
come on  come on 
it s not funny now  is it 
and it won t be
if we get caught 
come on  come on 
come on  come on  run 
get this thing
off of me 
now  that bag had double
the weight of before 
why the fuck
would you do that 
because i had to think
of the best case scenario
and the worst case scenario 
we gotta move fast 
we gotta start thinking
like professionals 
we re in business together 
there s not gonna be
some cozy reunion 
after this job  we re done 
we have three days to look
and move like a team of men 
the best thing we have going
for us is being who we are 
why 
because no one thinks we have
the balls to pull this off 
can i ask you a question 
as long as i can answer it
and still get to my meeting 
how come we
never go to your place 
my place 
that s your question 
i d like to see how you live 
i could cook you dinner 
we could watch some tv 
look  i really 
really like you  alice 
i don t think i ve ever been
this happy with a woman 
i truly do care about you 
i really do 
but i m not your husband 
i know you re not 
look  this is an arrangement 
okay  it s not a marriage 
i pay for things  and outta
that  you get a nice life 
i don t need you
to have a nice life 
look  if i ended things
right now 
what would you do for money 
excuse me 
my money  the way i live 
i m offering you
a nice life  alice 
you say  a life  like it s yours
to offer  but it s mine 
it s mine to be ashamed of
or be proud of 
mine to fuck up or make good 
it s mine 
i don t have time for this
right now  okay 
i have to go 
can i drop you somewhere 
i ll get where i need to go 
it s over

now harry s dead 
it ll be the third time
my alarm systems get hit

before cheating
on your wife with your niece 
you made a choice 
now  i ll go wait
at the gas station
