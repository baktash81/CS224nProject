 bullshit 
you have to arrive earlier
to get dressed and warmed up 
you have to take outside classes
in your major field   
   and study ballet  modern  folk 
jazz  tap and historical dance here   
   as well as dance history 
supported adagio   
   variation class  makeup  hairstyling
and even acting for dancers 
50 000 people call themselves actors 
and maybe 500 are making a living at it 
most of those do commercials to
pay the rent  the rest wait tables   
   clean other people s apartments 
living on welfare and hope 
don t think talent s enough
to get you through 
you gotta have a strong technique 
a good agent  and most of all  thick skin 
now you re part of an underprivileged
minority  and you re going to suffer 
pulled tendons  shin splints 
swollen toes  smelly tights     
cattle calls  the humiliation 
the rejection     
melodic dictation theory  keyboard
harmony  piano  piano literature   
   music history  orchestration 
conducting  symphonic band

oh  look at those tits 
oh  you could drown in those 
i want you to observe yourself
doing ordinary  everyday things 
you ll be asked to duplicate
those here in class 
an actor must develop
an acute sense memory   
   so concentrate on how you deal
with things in your world   
   how you wash your face
or hold your fork or lift your cup   
   comb your hair  observe and study
your own mechanicalness 
see if you can catch yourself in the
very act of doing or saying something 
see if your actions and reactions fall into
patterns and what those patterns are 
and in particular  pay close attention
to the physical world 
isolate and concentrate on the details 
oh  mamacita 
ay  caramba

last year  we worked
on simple observations 
this year  we re going to turn
that observation inward   
   and work on re creating
emotional states 
fear  joy  sorrow  anger 
and it ll be more difficult because you ll
have to expose more of you   
   what s on the inside of you 
for your first acting exercise
this year  i want you   
   to re create a difficult memory   
   a painful moment when you learned
something about yourself that hurt 
and i mean really hurt 
and reach 
and through  and drop 
and back 
hi  i m lisa monroe 
hilary van doren 
i love your coat 
i saw that in bendel s window 
 my stepmother bought it for me 
 really 
i wouldn t mind that kind of stepmother 
she didn t do it for me 
she wants my father to think she cares 
besides  she loves shopping 
she gets multiple orgasm
every time she buys something 
sounds great  i think i like her 
you can have her 
 where s all the sweat  lisa

you re not working on it hard enough 
get rid of the gum 
watch me 
lift the bow off the string  martelli 
mozart wouldn t do this today 
 do what 
 this bowing business 
he d plug his keyboard into an amp   
   and he d have string quartets
coming out of his fingers 
and who would play all these
science fiction symphonies 
 he would 
 all by himself 
he d overdub and mix  of course 
he wouldn t make the same old noise 
 noise 
 he d sound electric 
he d have spacier strings and horns
and computerized bassoons 
 one man is not an orchestra 
 who needs orchestras 
you can do it all with a keyboard 
an amp and enough power 
you re going to play all by yourself 
you don t need anybody else 
that s not music  martelli 
that s masturbation 
see  i m not naturally graceful 
grace doesn t run in our family 
it s our genes  i ve had to work
so hard to come this far 
 god  i ve been at it since i was 4 
 me too 
i started out with tap and stuff 
then my mom kept buying me pretty
ballet tutus  and i got hooked on it 
less lip  monroe  more sweat 
 she s just a bitch 
 she hates me 
this is a dance class  lisa 
not the charles atlas plan 
 shut your mouth 
 where are your tights 
i told you i got them 
i just forgot them 
what s he talking about 
tights  he won t wear them 
look  leroy  i told you  if you don t have
tights  you don t dance  now go 
oh  i love your accent 
what did you say 
i dig his black ass 
 it s taken  goldilocks 
 don t count on it 
a painful memory 
what does he mean by
a painful memory 
i don t know  i can t find
a painful memory 
i know i have them 
i mean  my pain s as good
as anybody else s 
i have lots of them  you can borrow
one of mine if you want 
like  i used to wet my bed  there  that
was painful  you can have that memory 
no  thank you 
then there was the last time my father
packed his bags and left us 
that really was painful 
or the first time my mother flew to l a 
and didn t come back for six weeks 
or the first time i fell in love 
where d that come from 
i ll buy you a cup of coffee 
you re gonna tell everybody that 
it s the most painful memory
i can think of 
he didn t say the most painful 
he just said painful 
 we re supposed to expose ourselves 
 imagine what ralph garci will say 
a pie in the face comes with the job 
that s what my mom says  she knows 
i don t get it 
a real artist must never be afraid of
what other people will say about him 
it was a time when i realized
something about myself 
 maybe you didn t realize it right 
 what do you mean 
well  i mean  everybody falls in love
with their analyst 
there s a word for that  isn t there 
homosexual 
that s my music 
that lunatic stole my tape 
wow  that s me 
that s my son s music 
my son bruno  bruno martelli 
he wrote the music 
today  46th street   
   tomorrow  madison square garden 
 papa  what are you doing 
 bruno 
you ve lost your mind  you re crazy 
those tapes aren t ready 
look at the people 
they don t know it s not ready 
look at it  they like it 
bruno  they like it  bruno 
 hey  yo

i ll get your ass  buddy 
who do you think you are 
you re next  you hear me 
get away from there 
what are you doing 
how do you like that 
pick that up  you son of a bitch 
i thought i was just
going through a stage 
that s what everyone told me 
and it never
worried me when i was 1 0 
except they told me the same thing
at 1 2 and 1 4 
so finally  my analyst
leveled with me 
he said it was probably a life choice 
it s funny 
 gay  used to mean
such a happy kind of word once 
not that it bothers me 
i m pretty well adjusted  really 
i mean   
   never being happy   
   isn t the same as being unhappy 
is it 
dr  golden explains it real well 
he explains everything well 
i ve had a lot of help 
hey  doris  you wanna go to

okay  doris  ralph 
i was coming home from
school one day 
as usual 
i had a couple of pieces of business
to attend to in the neighborhood 
it was january 
it was snowing like crazy 
santa claus just ripped
everybody off 
he split for toy town or lgloo city   
   or the north pole
or wherever the hell he goes 
so anyway     
i was going home  and     
i found this note 
it said my two chicks were in church 
what the hell are my two chicks
doing in church 
somebody die or something 
that was      that was a joke 
that was supposed to be a joke 
anyway  i went home 
i dropped a little incense like
i always do  just to unwind a little bit 
and i put on the tv set 
and there was
this guy on the tv 
and he was talking
about freddie 
he      he said that     
he said that freddie prinze
put a gun to his head   
   and he killed himself 
you know  it was an accident  man 
shit  i mean  he was fucking     
he was very gifted 
you always laughed at him
because he was very fucking talented 
and sometimes you didn t even
wanna laugh at him   
   and you laughed at him anyway 
but those motherfuckers   
   they had to say that
he was depressed   
   and he was suicidal 
and that he was fucked up 
they wanted his fucking ass  man 
they wanted to nail his ass 
because he didn t think living
was such a happy trip  you know 
we can t have happy people
walking on this planet 
everybody s gotta be
so goddamn serious 
everyone s gotta stay in business   
   and suffer so the witch doctors
and the deodorant spray people   
   and plastic surgeons
could stay in business 
and we can all go fucking pray
to the asshole god up there   
   that fucked it up
in the first place 
does all this make you
realize anything about yourself 
 what 
 how does it affect you 
how does it affect me 
i m here 
and i m in this fucking school 
and i m fucking everybody back

on a south bronx street   
   and ask him
what he wants to be 
 i want to be an ex junkie  man   
you can see them every day 
you can t drive because of the dreams
on the streets being seen by cokeheads 
the minute that white line s laid down

coming out of my feet 
and sleeping beauties   
   and the swan 
i want bravos in stuttgart
