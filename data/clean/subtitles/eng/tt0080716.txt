shes gorgeous
oh now turn around please
oh please
oh look at those tits
oh you could drown in those
i want you to observe yourself
doing ordinary everyday things
youll be asked to duplicate
those here in class
an actor must develop
an acute sense memory
so concentrate on how you deal
with things in your world
how you wash your face
or hold your fork or lift your cup
comb your hair observe and study
your own mechanicalness
see if you can catch yourself in the
very act of doing or saying something
see if your actions and reactions fall into
patterns and what those patterns are
and in particular pay close attention
to the physical world
isolate and concentrate on the details
oh mamacita
ay caramba

let me up let me up
let me see you fuckers
last year we worked
on simple observations
this year were going to turn
that observation inward
and work on recreating
emotional states
fear joy sorrow anger
and itll be more difficult because youll
have to expose more of you
whats on the inside of you
for your first acting exercise
this year i want you
to recreate a difficult memory
a painful moment when you learned
something about yourself that hurt
and i mean really hurt
and reach
and through and drop
and back
hi im lisa monroe
hilary van doren
i love your coat
i saw that in bendels window
my stepmother bought it for me
really
i wouldnt mind that kind of stepmother
she didnt do it for me
she wants my father to think she cares
besides she loves shopping
she gets multiple orgasm
every time she buys something
sounds great i think i like her
you can have her
wheres all the sweat lisa
im working on it
youre not working on it hard enough
get rid of the gum
watch me
lift the bow off the string martelli
mozart wouldnt do this today
do what
this bowing business
hed plug his keyboard into an amp
and hed have string quartets
coming out of his fingers
and who would play all these
sciencefiction symphonies
he would
all by himself
hed overdub and mix of course
he wouldnt make the same old noise
noise
hed sound electric
hed have spacier strings and horns
and computerized bassoons
one man is not an orchestra
who needs orchestras
you can do it all with a keyboard
an amp and enough power
youre going to play all by yourself
you dont need anybody else
thats not music martelli
thats masturbation
see im not naturally graceful
grace doesnt run in our family
its our genes ive had to work
so hard to come this far
god ive been at it since i was 4
me too
i started out with tap and stuff
then my mom kept buying me pretty
ballet tutus and i got hooked on it
less lip monroe more sweat
shes just a bitch
she hates me
this is a dance class lisa
not the charles atlas plan
shut your mouth
where are your tights
i told you i got them
i just forgot them
whats he talking about
tights he wont wear them
look leroy i told you if you dont have
tights you dont dance now go
oh i love your accent
what did you say
i dig his black ass
its taken goldilocks
dont count on it
a painful memory
what does he mean by
a painful memory
i dont know i cant find
a painful memory
i know i have them
i mean my pains as good
as anybody elses
i have lots of them you can borrow
one of mine if you want
like i used to wet my bed there that
was painful you can have that memory
no thank you
then there was the last time my father
packed his bags and left us
that really was painful
or the first time my mother flew to la
and didnt come back for six weeks
or the first time i fell in love
whered that come from
ill buy you a cup of coffee
youre gonna tell everybody that
its the most painful memory
i can think of
he didnt say the most painful
he just said painful
were supposed to expose ourselves
imagine what ralph garci will say
a pie in the face comes with the job
thats what my mom says she knows
i dont get it
a real artist must never be afraid of
what other people will say about him
it was a time when i realized
something about myself
maybe you didnt realize it right
what do you mean
well i mean everybody falls in love
with their analyst
theres a word for that isnt there
homosexual
thats my music
that lunatic stole my tape
wow thats me
thats my sons music
my son bruno bruno martelli
he wrote the music
today 46th street
tomorrow madison square garden
papa what are you doing
bruno
youve lost your mind youre crazy
those tapes arent ready
look at the people
they dont know its not ready
look at it they like it
bruno they like it bruno
hey yo

back it up
ill get your ass buddy
who do you think you are
youre next you hear me
get away from there
what are you doing
how do you like that
pick that up you son of a bitch
i thought i was just
going through a stage
thats what everyone told me
and it never
worried me when i was 1 0
except they told me the same thing
at 1 2 and 1 4
so finally my analyst
leveled with me
he said it was probably a life choice
its funny
gay used to mean
such a happy kind of word once
not that it bothers me
im pretty welladjusted really
i mean
never being happy
isnt the same as being unhappy
is it
dr golden explains it real well
he explains everything well
ive had a lot of help

or the north pole
or wherever the hell he goes
so anyway
i was going home and
i found this note
it said my two chicks were in church
what the hell are my two chicks
doing in church
somebody die or something
that was  that was a joke
that was supposed to be a joke
anyway i went home
i dropped a little incense like
i always do just to unwind a little bit
and i put on the tv set
and there was
this guy on the tv
and he was talking
about freddie
he  he said that
he said that freddie prinze
put a gun to his head
and he killed himself
you know it was an accident man
shit i mean he was fucking
he was very gifted
you always laughed at him
because he was very fucking talented
and sometimes you didnt even
wanna laugh at him
and you laughed at him anyway
but those motherfuckers
they had to say that
he was depressed
and he was suicidal
and that he was fucked up
they wanted his fucking ass man
they wanted to nail his ass
because he didnt think living
was such a happy trip you know
we cant have happy people
walking on this planet
everybodys gotta be
so goddamn serious
everyones gotta stay in business
and suffer so the witch doctors
and the deodorantspray people
and plastic surgeons
could stay in business
and we can all go fucking pray
to the asshole god up there
