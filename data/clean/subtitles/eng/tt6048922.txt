has fallen upon us 
twice in our lifetime
has the long arm of fate
reached out across the oceans
to bring the united states
into the forefront of the battle 
our american
merchant ships must be free
to carry our american goods
into the harbors of our friends 
and our american merchant ships
must be protected by our american navy 
the brunt of the war
has fallen upon the sailormen 
and we have lost nearly 3 000 lives
in a hard 
unrelenting struggle 
which goes on night and day
and is going on now
without a moment s respite 
the goods will be
delivered by this nation 
whose navy believes in the tradition
of  damn the torpedoes 
full speed ahead  
 dear lord 
let your holy angel be with me 
that the evil foe may have no power
over me  amen
