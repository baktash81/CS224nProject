has fallen upon us
twice in our lifetime
has the long arm of fate
reached out across the oceans
to bring the united states
into the forefront of the battle
our american
merchant ships must be free
to carry our american goods
into the harbors of our friends
and our american merchant ships
must be protected by our american navy
the brunt of the war
has fallen upon the sailormen
and we have lost nearly 3000 lives
in a hard
unrelenting struggle
which goes on night and day
and is going on now
without a moments respite
the goods will be
delivered by this nation
whose navy believes in the tradition
of damn the torpedoes
full speed ahead
dear lord
let your holy angel be with me
that the evil foe may have no power
over me amen
