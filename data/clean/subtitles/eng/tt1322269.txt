that was it 
he just left    
uh  huh 
i went to bed saturday night 
got up sunday mornin 
    still no beverly 
i didn t make much of it 
thought he d gone out on a bender 
why would he do that 
when  he can drink at home 
unless  you were riding his ass 
  i never said a word to him  
about his drinking  i didn t 
i never got on him about it 
so  sunday 
still no sign of him   
  that s when i got worked up about that 
safety deposit box  because  
we kept an awful lot of cash in
that box  some expensive jewelry 
i had a  
diamond ring in that box appraised
at over seven thousand dollars 
wait  wait  wait 
i m missing something 
why do you care about a safety
deposit box 
your father and i
had an arrangement 
if something were to ever happen to one of us 
the other one would go empty that box 
vi  you sure there wasn t some incident
that triggered his leaving  some event 
like a fight 
  yeah    no 
and we fought enough   
you know    but no 
maybe he needed some
time away from you 
oh  that s nice of you to say 
hey  it s no crime 
marriage is hard 
under the best of circumstances 
so  
nothing  no   see you later 
i m taking a walk  
mmmmhm 
good old unfathomable dad 
oh  that man  oh  
what i first fell in love with 
you know  was his mystery 
i thought it was sexy as hell 
you knew he was the smartest one in the room 
knew if he just said something   
knock you out 
but no  he d just stand there 
little smile on his face   
not say a word 
sexy 
you can t remember
anything unusual   
he hired this woman 
he didn t ask me  just hired this woman to come
live in our house  few days before he left 
you don t want her here 
i have an indian in my house 
you have a problem
with indians  violet 
i don t know what to say to an indian 
  they re called native americans  mom 
who makes that decision 
  it s what they like to be called 
they aren t any more native than me 
  in fact 
  they are 
  what s wrong with indian 
why can t you call people
what they wanna be called 
let s just call the dinosaurs
 native americans  while we re at it 
she may be an indian  but she makes
the best goddamn apple pie i ever ate 
he hired a cook 
it makes no sense  we don t eat 
and now you get biscuits and gravy 
kind of nice  huh 
that is nice 
nice for you  now 
but  soon you ll be gone 
never to return 
when was the last
time you were here 
don t get started  
  alright 
i don t care about you two 
but  i d like to see my
granddaughter every now and again 
well  you re seeing her now 
but your father 
you broke his heart when you moved away 
that is wildly unfair   you know you were beverly s favorite 
  am i going to have to separate you two 
   don t pretend you don t know 
i d prefer to think my parents loved
all their children equally 
i m sure you d prefer to think that santy claus
brought you presents at christmas  too 
if you d had more than one child  you d know
a parent always has favorites 
mattie fae was my mother s favorite 
big deal  i got used to it 
you were your daddy s favorite 
broke his heart 
what was i supposed to do  
colorado gave bill twice what he s making at tu 
  why are we even getting into this 
you think daddy wouldn t have
jumped at an opportunity like that 
you re wrong there  you never would ve
gotten beverly weston out of oklahoma 
he gave me his blessing 
that s what he told you  yeah  
and now  you re going to tell me the true story 
some terrible shit he said behind my back 
alright  everybody s on edge  
beverly didn t say terrible things behind your back
  vi  come on 
he just told me he s disappointed
in you because you settled 
he thought you had talent 
  as a writer 
daddy never said anything like that to you 
what a load of absolute horseshit 
horseshit 
horseshit  oh  horseshit 
let s all say horseshit 
say horseshit  bill 
horseshit 
are you high

i don t know what
you re talking about 
these fucking pills  calls at three
am about stars in your backyard 
this isn t  it isn t same thing 
i didn t have reason then 
so  it s okay to get hooked now
because you have a reason 
i m not hooked on anything 
i don t want to know
if you are or not 
i m just saying   i m not gonna
go through it again 
i m not  i m in pain 
because of your mouth 
yes  because my mouth burns 
i have got  
cancer in my mouth 
and it burns  look

and it burns like a    bullshit 
and beverly s disappeared and

when i got cancer 
beverlys disappeared  
you rushed right back 
i m sorry 
i m sorry   
you know where i think he is 
i think he  
i think he got some whiskey 
a carton of cigarettes  and
a couple of good spy novels   and  
i think he got out on the boat 
and steered it to a nice spot 
close to shore like he likes em 
and he s fishing  and reading
and drinking 
maybe even writing a little 
and  i think  
he s gonna walk through that door  
   any time

  the day  
beverly  
and then  
and then you re here  
and barbara  you re here  and beverly 
and then you re here  and then  
  you re here  
i used to go out with that boy 
that man 
  what man  the sheriff 
in high school 
he was my prom date 
you re kidding 
day of the prom  his father
got drunk and stole his car 
stole his own son s car 
went somewhere  mexico 
deon showed up at the house 
he d been crying 
confessed he didn t have a way
to take me to the prom 
so  we got a six pack  
  and broke into the chapel  stayed
up all night talking and kissing 
and  now here he is 
  showing me 
it s so surreal 
thank god we can t tell the future 
we d never get out of bed 
listen to me 
die after me  all right 
i don t care what else you do 
where you go  how
you screw up your life  just   
survive 
please 
holy shit  that s karen 
do you remember your aunt karen 
  kind of   
that must be this year s man 
i spent so much time
in our bedroom 
pretending my pillow
was my husband  
  and did he like the dinner i just made and
where were we going that winter on vacation  
  and then  he d surprise me with
tickets to belize and we d kiss 
i mean i d kiss my pillow 
and then i d say that
i d been to the doctor that i am  
maybe  i was pregnant 
i know how pathetic that sounds now 
but it was innocent enough 
then real life kicks in 
things don t work out
like you planned 
they never do  and then 
that pillow was a better husband
than any real man i d ever met 
and you punish yourself and tell yourself
it s your fault you can t find a good one 
i don t know how well you remember andrew 
you remember andrew 
no  i remember him 
i loved him   so intensely 
so  the things he did wrong  were just
opportunities for me to make  em right 
when he d cheat on me
or called me a cunt 
i d say   no  love is forever 
this is just an opportunity for me 
  to make an adjustment in the
way that i view the world  
and thank god  one day i looked
in the mirror and said   moron  
and i walked out 
but  one day  
finally i said 
 it s me 
it s just me 
i don t need anything else 
i can live my life with myself  
 and  that s how i got my license  i threw
myself into my work  sold a ton of houses 
  and that s how i met steve 
that s how it works  barb 
ah  he s ten years older 
but he is such a thinker 
   and he s such a good man 
he s such a good heart
and he s good for me 
i guess  the best thing
about him  for me 
   is that now  
  what i think about is now 
i live now 
my focus  my life  my world is now 
and you can t plan the future 
you just can t  cause as soon as you do 
something happens  some  
terrible thing happens  
  like your father drowning himself 
that s exactly what i mean 
you take it as it comes 
here and now 
steve had a huge presentation today for
some big wig government guys who could be  
  really important for his business
and he s put together for months now 
but   as soon as we
found about daddy 
he just canceled his meeting 
he has his priorities straight 
and  you know what the kicker is 
do you know what the
kicker is barb 
what s the kicker 
we re going to belize
on our honeymoon 
is it always this hot 
usually  it s hotter 
that s hard to imagine 
how old are you  about 
seventeen 
fourteen 
fourteen  right   
you know what i was doing
when i was fourteen 
cattle processing 
know what that is 
  it doesn t sound good 
slaughterhouse sanitation 
that s disgusting 
i wouldn t recommend it 
but hey  put food on the table 
get it 
what s that smell 
i don t know 
it s probably  that stop thrash can
over there 
nah  that s not what i m smelling 
what are you doing 
do i smell what i think i smell 
  i don t know 
what do you smell 
  is that    pot 
you smoking pot 
no 
  you can tell me 
you a little dope smoker

then you are in luck 
because  i happen to have some
really tasty shit

california merlots 
ahh  look at me  look at me 
  you re beautiful  mom 
i was beautiful 
hah  
not anymore 
  oh  now   
you re still beautiful 
one of those lies we tell to give us comfort 
women are beautiful 
when they re young and not after 
men can still preserve their
sex appeal into old age 
not those men like
you see with shorts 
and little purses around their waists 
  lord  lord 
some men can maintain a weary masculinity 
women just get old  
  and fat and wrinkly 
i beg your pardon 
i m still very sexy 
thank you very much 
  yeah  you re about as sexy
as a wet cardboard box  mattie fae 
you and me both 
look  wouldn t we be better off all of us 
if we stopped lying about these things 
  and told the truth 
 women aren t sexy
when they re old  
i can live with that 
can you live with that 
what about sophia loren 
what about lena horne 
she stayed sexy till she was eighty 
the world is round

i don t know how much you know about florida 
 florida politics 
only what i read and that s  
  right  right  this kind of business in particular 
   charlie

start time of your grandpa s funeral

i m sorry  dad 
no need to apologize 
  i know  mom s mad at me

  what did she say 
your mother 
she says what she says 
i set the alarm  i did 
i know you did 
  i loved uncle bev  you know that 
just stop  apologizing 
i missed his funeral 
ah  its  
it s a ceremony 
it s ceremonial 
it doesn t mean
anything compared to  
what you have in your heart 
hold on 
comb your hair 
uncle bev  must be
disappointed in me 
your uncle bev has got bigger
and better things ahead of him 
he doesn t have time for spite 
he wasn t that kind of man  anyway 
hey 
hey  it s okay 
just   
i know how things are 
i know how  they  
  think about me 
and something like this   
you want to be there for people 
i m sorry i let you down  dad 
  hey  you haven t let me down 
you never let me down 
now listen   
you re wrong about these
people  they love you

some of them 
haven t gotten a chance to see
what i see 
a fine man 
very loving 
  a with a lot to offer 
now take this
give me my comb 
i love you  dad 
love you too  son 
phantom of the opera 
you don t remember
what it was like to be fourteen 
she s old enough to exhibit
a little character 
but  that s something you normally
learn from your parents 
that s a shot across my bow  right 
i missed something 
really  instilling character 
our burden as parents 
  i got that part 
and you really haven t
been much of a parent lately 
  so it s tough to  
  just because you and i are  
  struggling with this gordian knot
it doesn t mean  
  but her fourteen year old
self might view it differently 
might consider it  abandonment 
oh  come on  she s a little more sophisticated
than that  don t you think 
pretty fucking sophisticated 
the restored whatever from phantom of the
opera  i know that makes your dick hard  
barbara   
  precocious little shit 
i m not defending her 
  i am not blaming her 
i m on your side 
    selfish son of a bitch 
be a father  help me 
  i am her father  goddamn it 
her father in name only 
  i have not forsook my responsibilities 
it s  forsaken   big shot 
actually   forsook  is also an
acceptable usage 
oh   forsook  you and the horse
you rode in on 
you don t fight fair 
i ve seen where that gets me 
grow up  while you re dyeing your hair
and going through your fifth puberty 
the world is falling apart and
your kid can t handle it 
our kid is just trying to deal with this
goddamn madhouse you ve dragged her into 
this madhouse is my home 
think about that statement
for a second  why don t you 
jean is here with me because  
  this is a family event 
  jean s here with you because she s a buffer  
between you and the shrill insanity
of your mother 
y know  you d have a lot more
credibility if you had any credibility 
you re a easy mark 
  you re so goddamn self righteous 
  you know that  you re so  
  surely you must ve realised  
when you started porking pippi longstocking
you were due for a little self righteousness 
  just a smidge of indignation on my part 
  maybe  i split because of it 
is this your confession  then 
when you finally  unload all  hmm 
you re thoughtful  barbara 
but you re not open 
you re passionate  but you re hard 
you re a good  decent  funny 
wonderful woman  and i love you  but  
you re a pain in the ass 
one for me 
one for the girls 
mom s casserole 
they said you overslept 
maybe i purposely accidentally overslept

amen  so  sorry folks 
  let s eat 
barb  you have any use
for that sideboard 
that sideboard there 
you have any interest in that 
it s so pretty 
no  i mean  why 
i m getting rid of a lot of this stuff and
i thought you might want that sideboard 
no  mom  i   i wouldn t have any
way to get that home to colorado 
maybe  ivy ll take it 
i have something like that  remember 
  clearing all this out of here 
it s really pretty 
  i want to have a brand new everything 
i guess i m just sort of    not
prepared to talk about your stuff 
suit yourself 
the food is just spectacular 
johnna cooked this
whole meal by herself 
it s what she s paid for 
y all did know she s getting paid  right 
jean 
so  i m curious 
when you say you don t eat meat 
you mean  you don t eat meat of any kind 
right 
is that for health reasons  or    
when you eat meat 
you ingest an animal s fear 
ingest what 
it s fur 
  fear 
i thought she said   
how do you do that 
you can t eat fear 
sure you can  i mean  
what happens to you 
when you feel afraid 
doesn t your body produce
all sorts of chemical reactions 
i don t know  
does it 
it does 
  yes 
adrenaline  and  and   
your body goes through a whole chemical
process when it experiences fear 
  and cortisol 
  don t you think an animal experiences fear 
you bet it does 
i used to work at a
cattle processing plant 
lots of fear flying
around that place 
so  when you eat an meat 
you re ingesting all that fear it felt
when it was slaughtered to make food 
you mean i ve been
eating fear  what 
 three times a day for  
  sixty years 
this one won t have a meal
that doesn t meat in it 
  i guess it s the way i was raised 
but  somehow it just doesn t seem like a
legitimate meal less it has some meat somewhere 
if i make a pasta dish of
some kind  he ll be like 
  that s fine for an appetizer 
but where s the meat  
isn t that some tv commercial 
the old lady says 
 where s the meat  
 where s the beef  
 where s the meat   
 where s the meat   
 where s the meat   
 hey  where s the meat   
that s pleasant 
i thought 
the services were lovely 
yes  weren t they 
  preacher did a fine job 
i give it a   ehhhhh 
  really  you thought so 
great  now we get some
dramatic criticism 
too much talk about
poetry and teaching 
he hadn t written any poetry 
to speak of since  65
he never liked teaching worth a damn 
nobody talked about the good stuff 
man was a world class alcoholic 
more n fifty years 
nobody told the story about that night he got
wrangled into giving a talk at that tu alumni dinner   
drank a whole bottle of
ron bocoy white rum 
don t know why i remember that 
and got up to give this talk 
and he fouled himself 
comes back to our table with this great  
  yeah  i can t imagine why no one told that story 
well  he didn t get invited back to
anymore tu alumni dinners 
i can tell you that 
i don t know much
about poetry  but  
i thought his poems
were extraordinary 
and your reading was very fine 
thank you 
who are you 
this is my fiance  steve 
you met him at the church 
steve heidebrecht 
hide the what 
  heidebrecht 
hide a burrr   it s german 
  well  german irish  really  
that s peculiar  karen 
to bring a date to
your father s funeral 
i know the poetry was good  but i really
wouldn t have considered it date material 
he s not a date  he s my fiance 
we re getting married on new years  in miami 
and  i would love it 
if you can make it 
i don t really see that
happening  do you 
steve 
that right  steve 
yes  ma am 
you ever been married before 
yes  ma am  i have 
more then once 
three times  actually 
three times before this 
you should pretty much
have it down by now  then 
right 
right  
i had that one pegged  didn t i 
i mean  look at him 
you can tell he s been married 
i went outside to show steve the old fort
and it s torn down 
that s been gone for years 
  i was so sad 
what is this now 
  our old fort  where we used to play  
cowboys and indians 
  daddy said rats were getting in there 
karen  shame on you 
don t you know not to say
cowboys and indians 
you played cowboys and
native americans 
right barb 
what are you taking 
what pills 
oh  leave me alone 
uh oh 
what is it 
what is it 
what s the matter 
  you okay  uncle charles 
uh oh 
i got a big bite of fear 
fear never tasted so good 
it s pretty good once
you get used to the taste 
i m shakin  in my boots 
i do catch her eating a cheeseburger
every now and again 
no  you don t 
  double cheeseburger  bacon  extra fear 
mom  you are such a liar 
no stop  you are 
y know  if i ever called
my mother a liar 
she would ve knocked my goddamn
head off my shoulders 
you girls know there s a will 
mom   
we took care of it some time back 
we don t want to talk about it 
i want to talk about it 
what about what i want to talk about 
does that count for anything 
bev made some good investments 
believe it or not 
we had money for you girls
in his will  but  
we talked it over
after some times passed
and decided to change things 
leave everything to me 
we didn t get around to
taking care of it legally  but  
you should know he meant
to leave the money to me 
okay 
okay 
okay 
okay 
karen  okay 
yeah  okay 
  okay 
but now some of this furniture 
some of this old shit you can just have 
i don t want it  got no use for it 
maybe  i should have an auction 
sure  an auction s a fine idea 
some things  though  like the silver 
that s worth a pretty penny 
but  if you like i ll sell
it to you  if you like 
for cheaper n i might
get in an auction 
or you might never
get around to the auction 
and then we can just have it
for free after you die 
barbara   
you might at that 
bill  i was wondering 
you reading those poems  
which ones did you  
  choose in the end to read 
  well i  
bill  where are you living now 
you want this old sideboard 
i beg your pardon 
  you and barbara are separated  right 
or  are you divorced already 
no  we re separated

your father thought he s slipping
one by me too  right 
what is the matter with you 
  i m sorry you two re having trouble 
maybe you can work it out 
bev n i separated a few times 
course we didn t call it that

from your storybook marriage 
truth is  you just can t compete
with a younger woman

things in life 
is there a younger woman involved 
  you ve said enough on this topic 
yes  there s a younger woman 
  well  y see 
odds re against you there  babe 
mom believes women don t grow
more attractive with age

of opinion  karen dear

with his mother  his father 
in a fucking car 
six fucking years in a car

your rotten childhood 
jesus 
that s the crux of the biscuit 
we lived too hard  
and then rose too high 
we sacrificed everything 
we did it all for you 
your father and i were the first in
our families to graduate high school 
and he wound up 
an award winning poet 
you girls  just  
given a college education 
taken for granted  no doubt 
where did you wind up 
what did you do 
what did you do 
who are you 
jesus 
jesus  you worked as hard as us 
you d all be president 
you never had real problems 
so  you got to make all
your problems yourselves 
why are you screaming at us 
just time we had some truth s

karen  call dr  burke 
you can t do this 
this is my house 
this is my house 
you don t get it  do you

i m running things now 
why d dr  burke write her so many
prescriptions 
didn t he know 
it s not just him 
she s got a doctor in every port 
and you knew 
 this was going on again 
i m sorry about you and bill 
me too  barb 
you think  it s temporary or  
who knows 
we ve been married a long time 
now what 
dr  burke  the chemotherapy and radiation 
coupled with the overuse of  
pain medications 
  right  
and without the benefit of more
thorough testing 
an mri or ct scan 
i believe your mother is suffering
from mild cognitive impairment 
  mild cognitive impairment 
brain damage 
it may be time to consider placing
her in a long term care facility 
i know i d feel more comfortable if i know 
she was receiving that level of supervision 
and  where would you
have us put her 
a psychiatric hospital 
well  beverly s gone 
well  not so much as  gone 
as  dead   but i see your point 
legal guardianship  for you and your
sisters  with my recommendation  
so you re thinking  if the three of us
cooperated with this 
commitment end around 
we d be less likely to sue your ass 
i m sorry 
   mild cognitive impairment  
are you fucking kidding me 
all right 
know whose name is
on these bottles 
do you 
  your mother s a very sick person 
we ve a whole bucket of these
with your name on it 
evidence for the medical board 
let s go 
i thing we re done 
pull the car over 
we ll be home in a minute 
pull the car over 
i m going to be sick 
mom  mom 
mom  
mom 
mom 
mom  wait 
mom 
what are you doing 
where the fuck are you going 
there s no place to go 
i m sorry 
honey  please 
  no  it s important i say this 
i lost my temper at dinner
and went too far 
barbara 
the day  the funeral   
the pills  i was  
spoiling for a fight and you
gave it to me 
so    truce 
truce 
yeah  sure 
now  what 
how do you mean 
don t you think you should consider
going back to a rehab center 
i can t go through that again 
i can do this 
you ve  
you took all my pills  right 
all that we could find 
  well   
i don t have that many hiding places 
  now  mom  come on 
you wanna search me 
  no 
if the pills are gone 
i ll be fine 
i just need a few days
to get my feet under me 
i want you to know  you re not alone 
if you need any help 
i don t need help 
i wanna help 
  i don t need your help 
mom 
  i don t need your help 
i ve gotten myself  
i know how this goes 
once all the talking s through 
people go back to their own  
   nonsense 
i know that  so 
don t worry about me  i ll manage 
i get by 
remember when we checked her in the
psych ward  that stunt she pulled 
big speech  
she s getting clean  making this
incredible sacrifice for her family 
she s let us down but now
she ll prove she s a good mother 
she smuggled darvocet
into the psych ward  
   in her vagina 
there s your greatest
generation for you 
she s giving this speech
to us while she was  
  clenching a bottle of pills
in her cooch 
i ve never heard this story 
did you just say  cooch  
the phrase  mom s pussy 
seems gauche 
you re a little more comfortable
with  cooch   are you 
what word should i use to describe
our mother s vagina 
i don t know  barb 
   mom s beaver  
  mother s box  
  oh god  barbara 
one thing about mom and dad 
you have to tip your cap to anybody
who can stay married that long 
karen  he killed himself 
we don t know that  for sure 
is there something going on between
you and little charles 
i don t know that i m comfortable
talking about that 
because  he s our first cousin  you know 
  give me a break 
you know you shouldn t
consider children 
i can t anyway 
i had a hysterectomy last year 
why 
  cervical cancer 
i didn t know 
  neither did i 
i didn t tell anyone
except charles 
that s where it started between us 
why not 
  and hear it from mom the rest of my life 
she doesn t need another excuse to
treat me like some damaged thing 
you might have told us 
you didn t tell us about you and bill 
  that s different 
why 
because it s you  and not me 
because divorce is an embarrassing
public admission of defeat 
cancer s fucking cancer 
you can t help that 
we re your sisters 
i don t feel that
connection very keenly 
i feel very connected 
to both of you 
we never see you 
you re never around 
you haven t been around   
  i still feel that connection 
i can t perpetuate these myths of family
or sisterhood anymore 
we re just people  some of us
accidentally connected by genetics 
a random selection of cells 
when did you get so cynical 
  that s funny  coming from you 
well  bitter  yes  but
 random selection of cells  
maybe my cynicism came with the
realization that the responsibility 
of caring for our
parents was mine alone 
don t give me that  i participated 
till you had enough and got out 
you and karen both  i m not criticizing 
do what you want 
you did  karen did 
and if you didn t 
that s not my fault 
that s right  so don t lay this sister
thing on me  all right 
when i leave here i won t feel
any more guilty than you two did 
i can t believe
your world view is this dark 
you live in florida 
you re thinking of leaving 
yeah 
charles and i are
going to new york 
what are you going
to do in new york 
we have plans 
like what 
  none of your business 
what about mom 
  what about her 
you feel comfortable leaving her here 
  do you 
you re going back to miami  right 
  yes  i can t stay 
there you go  barb 
you want to know what we re doing about mom 
karen and i are leaving 
you want to stay  that s your decision 
but nobody gets to point a finger at me 
nobody 
my three girls 
all together 
hearing you just now
gave me a warm feeling 
you had a bath 
  yeah 
you want something to eat 
some coffee 
i m fine  honey  thank you 
i ll bet  this house must have heard
a lot of weston girl secrets 
i get embarrassed
just thinking about it 
oh    nothing to be
embarrassed about 
secret crushes  secret schemes 
i can t imagine anything more
delicate  or bittersweet 
some part of you girls
i always identified with   
no matter how old you get 
a woman s hard pressed to throw off
that part of herself 
that smells so good 
it s apple  you want some 
sure  i do 
hey  did i ever tell you
the story of raymond qualls 
that s a boy i had a crush on
when i was thirteen or so 
rough looking boy 
beat up jeans and messy hair 
terrible underbite 
but he had these
beautiful cowboy boots 
shiny chocolate leather 
he was so proud of those boots 
you could tell  the way  
he d strut around  all arms and
elbows  puffed up and cocksure 
i convinced myself that i needed to
get a girly pair of those boots 
and i was sure if i did that
that he d ask me to go steady 
you know  he d see me in those boots
and say  that s the gal for me  
oh  gosh 
so  i found the boots
in a window downtown 
and  i just went crazy 
praying for those boots 
i m rehearsing the  
conversation that i d have with
raymond when he saw me in my boots 
must ve asked my momma a hundred
times if i could get those boots 
  vi  what do you
want for christmas  
 momma  i ll give all of it up just
to have those boots   bargaining  
so  she started laying little hints around
about box a package under the tree  
she had wrapped up 
about the size of a boot box 
real nice wrapping paper 
 now  vi  don t you cheat
 and don t you go in there
before christmas morning  
little smile on her face 
christmas morning  i was up like a shot  boy 
 under the tree 
i was tearing the paper   
there were boots in there 
men s work boots 
holes in the toes 
chewed up laces and  
caked in mud  
caked in mud and dog shit 
lord 
my momma laughed for days 
please  don t tell me
that s the end of the story 
oh  no  that  
that s the end 
you never got the boots 
no  huh uh 
my momma was a mean  
nasty mean old lady 
i suppose that s where i get it  
  from 
you re not nasty mean 
you re our mother and we love you 
is the coast clear 
never very 
what are you watching 
television 
can i watch it with you 
i wish you would 
are you mad at me 
  nope 
i was trying to be brave 
i know 
i just    i want everyone to know
that i got what i always wanted 
and that means    i m not a loser 
  hey   hey 
you re my hero 
i wrote this for you 
sit down 
well  i ve never been a
man of many words 
and  there s nothing i could say
that you haven t never heard 
but  i ll sing you love songs
till the day i die 
the way i m feeling 
i can t keep it inside 
i ll sing a sweet serenade whenever
you re feeling sad 
and  a lullaby each night
before you go to bed 
i ll sing to you for the rest of your life  
  liberace 
you better get yourself together 
we have to get home and take care
of those damn dogs 
they ve probably eaten
the drapes by now 
i m sure the house is fine 
  oh  look  honey  little charles has got the tv on 
this one watches so
much television 
it s rotted his brain 
  i m sure that s not true 
what was it i caught you
watching the other day 
i don t remember 
  you do so remember 
  some dumb talk show about
people swapping wives 
i don t remember 
too bad there isn t a job where they
pay you to sit around watching tv 
c mon  mattie fae  
  y know he got fired from a shoe store 
mattie fae 
we re gonna get in
the car and go home 
and if you say one more mean
thing to that boy  
i m going to kick
your fat irish ass  
onto the highway 
  what the hell did you say to me 
you kids go outside 
would you please 
i don t understand this meanness 
i look at you and your sister  
and the way you talk to people
and i don t understand it 
i can t understand why
folks can t be
respectful of one another 
i don t think there s
any excuse for it 
my family didn t treat each other that way 
  maybe that s because your family   
you had better not say anything about
my family right now  i mean it 
we buried a man i loved very much 
and whatever faults  
he may have had 
he was a good  kind 
decent man 
and to hear you tear
into your own son 
not even a day later that
dishonors beverly s memory 
we ve been married
thirty eight years 
and i wouldn t trade them
for anything 
ut if you can t find a
generous place in your heart
for your own son 
we re not going to make
it to thirty nine 
i didn t mean to eavesdrop 
i froze 
that s   
you have a cigarette  hon 
no  i quit years ago 
so did i 
just sounded good to me 
i thought at dinner   
at that horrible
dinner seemed like 
something might be going on between
ivy and little charles 
do you know if that s true 
i m not sure  
  just 
is it true 
yes  it s true 
okay 
that can t happen 
this is going to be difficult 
 uh    ivy and little
charles have always
 marched to their own    and i d
expect this to be toughest on you  
barb    
  they re in love 
they think they are  i know it s
unorthodox for cousins to get together 
    at least these days 
  they re not cousins 
beg pardon 
little charles is not your cousin 
he s your brother 
he s your blood brother 
half brother

did dad know

y know  i m not proud of this 
  really 
you people amaze me 
what  were you drunk  was this just some  
  i wasn t drunk  no 
maybe it s hard for you to believe 
looking at me  knowing me the way
you do  all these years  i mean  i know to you 
i m just your old fat aunt mattie fae 
i m more than that  sweetheart 
there s more to me than that 
i don t know why little charles
is such a disappointment to me 
maybe he 
well  i don t know why 
i m disappointed for him 
more than anything 
i made a mistake  a long time ago 
okay  i paid for it 
but the mistake ends here 
if ivy found out 
it would destroy her 
i m sure as hell not
gonna tell her 
you have to find a way to stop it 
you have to put a stop to it 
hold it 
don t let it out 
that s a kick  huh 
if you won t look 
there s no point in showing them to you 
okay  okay 
i ll look 
you re gonna get us
both in trouble 
i m white and over thirty 
i don t get in trouble 
oh my god   
oh  my god 
goddamn it 
  stop it 
stop  stop 
what is wrong with you 
steve 
what happened 
she was messing with jean 
baby are you okay 
jean  what are you doing up 
do i need to call a doctor 
i don t know 
johnna  what s going on 
he was messing with jean 
so  i tuned him up 
messing with  what do you mean 
messing with 
he was kissing and grabbing her 
i ll murder you  you prick 
you know how old that girl is 
she s fourteen years old 
  i didn t do anything 
are you out of your goddamn mind 
  just back off  barbara 
that son of a bitch is a sociopath 
what is the matter with you 
will you please stop freaking out 
why don t you start
at the beginning 
what are you even doing up 
  sweetheart  we need to know what went on here 
nothing  went on  
nothing  okay  can we not turn
everything a federal case here  okay  
i came down smoked a little pot 
smoked a little pot and  
we were just goofing around and then
everything just got a little bit crazy 
what have i told you about smoking that shit  
  then johnna just chose to attack him with a shovel 
just tell me what he did 
  he didn t do anything 
what s the big deal 
  the big deal  jean 
is that you re fourteen years old 
just a few years younger than
you like  em 
i hate you 
what s the matter with you 
jean 
i can do without a speech 
  where is he 
out at the car  we re leaving 
back to florida  tonight  now 
me and steve  together 
you wannna give me some grief about that 
  now you wait goddamn it 
you better find out from jean
exactly what went on  
before you start pointing fingers 
because  i doubt jean s
blameless in all this 
and i m not saying
that i blame her  
just cause i said she s not blameless 
it doesn t mean i ve blamed her 
i m saying she might
share in the responsibility 
it s not cut and dried 
it lives where everything lives 
somewhere in the middle 
where the rest of us live 
everyone but you 
  karen  
i m no angel myself 
i ve done some things
i m not proud of 
things you ll never know about 
and  i may even have to do some
things i m not proud of again 
cause  life puts you
in a corner that way 
anyway  
you have your own hash to settle 
before you start making
speeches to the rest of us 
and  come january   
i ll be in belize 
doesn t that sound nice 
i m taking jean with me  heading
back to colorado in the morning

i ve always known that 
i told you  nobody
slips anything by me 
mom   
  don t listen 
i knew the whole time
bev and mattie fae were carrying on 
charlie should have known too 
if he wasn t smoking all that grass 
it s the pills talking 
  pills can t talk 
your father tore
himself up over it 
thirty some odd years  but  
beverly wouldn t have been beverly if
he didn t have plenty to brood about 
mom  what are you about 
better you girls know now though 
now you re older 
you never know when someone
might need a kidney 
why in god s name
did you tell me this 
hey  what do you care 
you re monsters 
come on now 
  monsters   
who s the injured party here 
ivy  listen   
  you will never see me  again 
mattie fae told me 
i didn t know what to do 
i was trying to protect you 
we ll go anyway 
we ll still go away 
this is not my fault 
mom told you  it wasn t me  it was mom 
there s no difference 
ivy  ivy 
ivy 
we couldn t let ivy run off
with little charles 
just wouldn t be right 
she ll be back 
she s a sweet girl  ivy 
and i love her to death  but  
she isn t strong 
not like you 
or me 
you knew about daddy
and mattie fae 
oh sure 
sure 
but  i never told them i knew 
but your father knew 
he knew i knew 
but  we never talked about it 
i chose the higher ground 
if i d had the chance 
there at the end 
i would ve  
i would ve told him 
 i hope this isn t about little charles 
cause you know i know
all about that  
if i d reached him at that motel 
i would ve said 
 you d be better off if you quit
sulking about this
ancient history  
  what motel 
i called over there on monday
after i got into that safety deposit box 
but it was too late 
he d checked out 
how did you know where he was 
the note  he said i could call him
over at the country squire motel 
he left a note 
and i did  i called
over there on monday 
after you got your money 
out of your safety deposit box   
we had  
  an arrangement 
you have to understand 
for people like your father and me 
who never had any money 
ever  as kids 
people from our generation 
that money is important 
if you could ve stopped daddy
from killing himself  you wouldn t have
needed to get into your safety deposit box 
well  hindsight s always twenty
twenty  isn t it 
did the note say he was
going to kill himself 
mom 
if i had my  
wits about me  maybe
i might ve done it different  but  
i was 
your father and me both 
we were   
  you were both fucked up   
you were fucked up   
you are fucked up 
you d better understand this 
you smug little ingrate 
there s only  one reason beverly
killed himself and that s you 
think there s any way he would ve done
what he did if you were still here 
no 
just him and me 
in this house  alone in the dark 
abandoned  wasted lifetimes
devoted to your care and comfort 
oh  yes  
you stick that knife of judgment in me 
go ahead  but make no mistake 
his blood is just as much on
your hands as it is on mine 
he did this though 
this is his doing  not ours 
can you imagine anything more cruel 
to make me responsible 
why 
just to weaken me 
make me prove my character 
so  no  i waited  i waited to get my
hands on that safety deposit box 
but  i would have waited anyway 
you want to show
who s stronger  bev 
nobody s stronger than me  goddamn it 
when nothing is left 
when everything is gone
and disappeared 
i ll be here 
who s stronger now 
you son of a bitch  
you re right  mom 
you re the strong one
