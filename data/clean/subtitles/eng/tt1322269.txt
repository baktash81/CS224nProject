i didnt make much of it
thought hed gone out on a bender
why would he do that
when he can drink at home
unless you were riding his ass
i never said a word to him
about his drinking i didnt
i never got on him about it
so sunday
still no sign of him
thats when i got worked up about that
safety deposit box because
we kept an awful lot of cash in
that box some expensive jewelry
i had a
diamond ring in that box appraised
at over seven thousand dollars
wait wait wait
im missing something
why do you care about a safety
deposit box
your father and i
had an arrangement
if something were to ever happen to one of us
the other one would go empty that box
vi you sure there wasnt some incident
that triggered his leaving some event
like a fight
yeah  no
and we fought enough
you know but no
maybe he needed some
time away from you
oh thats nice of you to say
hey its no crime
marriage is hard
under the best of circumstances
so
nothing no see you later
im taking a walk
mmmmhm
good old unfathomable dad
oh that man oh
what i first fell in love with
you know was his mystery
i thought it was sexy as hell
you knew he was the smartest one in the room
knew if he just said something
knock you out
but no hed just stand there
little smile on his face
not say a word
sexy
you cant remember
anything unusual
he hired this woman
he didnt ask me just hired this woman to come
live in our house few days before he left
you dont want her here
i have an indian in my house
you have a problem
with indians violet
i dont know what to say to an indian
theyre called native americans mom
who makes that decision
its what they like to be called
they arent any more native than me
in fact
they are
whats wrong with indian
why cant you call people
what they wanna be called
lets just call the dinosaurs
native americans while were at it
she may be an indian but she makes
the best goddamn apple pie i ever ate
he hired a cook
it makes no sense we dont eat
and now you get biscuits and gravy

that is nice
nice for you now
but soon youll be gone
never to return
when was the last
time you were here
dont get started
alright
i dont care about you two
but id like to see my
granddaughter every now and again
well youre seeing her now
but your father
you broke his heart when you moved away
that is wildly unfair you know you were beverlys favorite
am i going to have to separate you two
dont pretend you dont know
id prefer to think my parents loved
all their children equally
im sure youd prefer to think that santy claus
brought you presents at christmas too
if youd had more than one child youd know
a parent always has favorites
mattie fae was my mothers favorite
big deal i got used to it
you were your daddys favorite
broke his heart
what was i supposed to do
colorado gave bill twice what hes making at tu
why are we even getting into this
you think daddy wouldnt have
jumped at an opportunity like that
youre wrong there you never wouldve
gotten beverly weston out of oklahoma
he gave me his blessing
thats what he told you yeah
and now youre going to tell me the true story
some terrible shit he said behind my back
alright everybodys on edge
beverly didnt say terrible things behind your back
vi come on
he just told me hes disappointed
in you because you settled
he thought you had talent
as a writer
daddy never said anything like that to you
what a load of absolute horseshit
horseshit
horseshit oh horseshit

and barbara youre here and beverly
and then youre here and then
youre here
i used to go out with that boy
that man
what man the sheriff
in high school
he was my prom date
youre kidding
day of the prom his father
got drunk and stole his car
stole his own sons car
went somewhere mexico
deon showed up at the house
hed been crying
confessed he didnt have a way
to take me to the prom
so we got a sixpack
and broke into the chapel stayed
up all night talking and kissing
and now here he is
showing me
its so surreal
thank god we cant tell the future
wed never get out of bed
listen to me
die after me all right
i dont care what else you do
where you go how
you screw up your life just
survive
please
holy shit thats karen
do you remember your aunt karen
kind of
that must be this years man
i spent so much time
in our bedroom
pretending my pillow
was my husband
and did he like the dinner i just made and
where were we going that winter on vacation
and then hed surprise me with
tickets to belize and wed kiss
i mean id kiss my pillow
and then id say that
id been to the doctor that i am
maybe i was pregnant
i know how pathetic that sounds now
but it was innocent enough
then real life kicks in
things dont work out
like you planned
they never doand then
that pillow was a better husband
than any real man id ever met
and you punish yourself and tell yourself
its your fault you cant find a good one
i dont know how well you remember andrew
you remember andrew
no i remember him
i loved him so intensely
so the things he did wrong were just
opportunities for me to make em right
when hed cheat on me
or called me a cunt
id say no love is forever
this is just an opportunity for me
to make an adjustment in the
way that i view the world
and thank god one day i looked
in the mirror and said moron
and i walked out
but one day
finally i said
its me
its just me
i dont need anything else
i can live my life with myself
and thats how i got my license i threw
myself into my work sold a ton of houses
and thats how i met steve
thats how it works barb
ah hes ten years older
but he is such a thinker
and hes such a good man
hes such a good heart
and hes good for me
i guess the best thing
about him for me
is that now
what i think about is now
i live now
my focus my life my world is now
and you cant plan the future
you just cant cause as soon as you do
something happens some
terrible thing happens
like your father drowning himself
thats exactly what i mean
you take it as it comes
here and now
steve had a huge presentation today for
some bigwig government guys who could be
really important for his business
and hes put together for months now
but as soon as we
found about daddy
he just canceled his meeting
he has his priorities straight
and you know what the kicker is
do you know what the
kicker is barb
whats the kicker
were going to belize
on our honeymoon
is it always this hot
usually its hotter
thats hard to imagine
how old are you about
seventeen
fourteen
fourteen right
you know what i was doing
when i was fourteen
cattle processing

it doesnt sound good
slaughterhouse sanitation
thats disgusting
i wouldnt recommend it
but hey put food on the table

california merlots
ahh look at me look at me
youre beautiful mom
i was beautiful
hah

one of those lies we tell to give us comfort
women are beautiful
when theyre young and not after
men can still preserve their
sex appeal into old age
not those men like
you see with shorts
and little purses around their waists
lordlord
some men can maintain a weary masculinity
women just get old
and fat and wrinkly
i beg your pardon
im still very sexy
thank you very much
yeah youre about as sexy
as a wet cardboard box mattie fae
you and me both
look wouldnt we be better off all of us
if we stopped lying about these things
and told the truth
women arent sexy
when theyre old
i can live with that
can you live with that
what about sophia loren
what about lena horne
she stayed sexy till she was eighty
the world is round
get over it
hey try this dress on

phantom of the opera
you dont remember
what it was like to be fourteen
shes old enough to exhibit
a little character
but thats something you normally
learn from your parents
thats a shot across my bow right
i missed something
really instilling character
our burden as parents
i got that part
and you really havent
been much of a parent lately
so its tough to
just because you and i are
struggling with this gordian knot
it doesnt mean
but her fourteenyearold
self might view it differently
might consider it abandonment
oh come on shes a little more sophisticated
than that dont you think
pretty fucking sophisticated
the restored whatever from phantom of the
opera i know that makes your dick hard
barbara
precocious little shit
im not defending her
i am not blaming her

acceptable usage

between you and the shrill insanity
of your mother
yknow youd have a lot more
credibility if you had any credibility
youre a easy mark
youre so goddamn selfrighteous
you know that youre so
surely you mustve realised
when you started porking pippi longstocking
you were due for a little selfrighteousness
just a smidge of indignation on my part
maybe i split because of it
is this your confession then
when you finally unload all hmm
youre thoughtful barbara
but youre not open
youre passionate but youre hard
youre a good decent funny
wonderful woman and i love you but
youre a pain in the ass

im getting rid of a lot of this stuff and
i thought you might want that sideboard
no mom ii wouldnt have any
way to get that home to colorado
maybe ivyll take it
i have something like that remember
clearing all this out of here
its really pretty
i want to have a brand new everything
i guess im just sort of not
prepared to talk about your stuff
suit yourself
the food is just spectacular
johnna cooked this
whole meal by herself
its what shes paid for
yall did know shes getting paid right
jean
soim curious
when you say you dont eat meat
you mean you dont eat meat of any kind
right
is that for health reasons or
when you eat meat
you ingest an animals fear
ingest what
its fur
fear
i thought she said
how do you do that
you cant eat fear
sure you can i mean
what happens to you
when you feel afraid
doesnt your body produce
all sorts of chemical reactions
i dont know
does it
it does
yes
adrenaline and and
your body goes through a whole chemical
process when it experiences fear
and cortisol
dont you think an animal experiences fear
you bet it does
i used to work at a
cattle processing plant
lots of fear flying
around that place
so when you eat an meat
youre ingesting all that fear it felt
when it was slaughtered to make food
you mean ive been
eating fear what
three times a day for
sixty years
this one wont have a meal
that doesnt meat in it
i guess its the way i was raised
but somehow it just doesnt seem like a
legitimate meal less it has some meat somewhere
if i make a pasta dish of
some kind hell be like
thats fine for an appetizer
but wheres the meat
isnt that some tv commercial
the old lady says
wheres the meat
wheres the beef
wheres the meat
wheres the meat
wheres the meat
hey wheres the meat
thats pleasant
i thought
the services were lovely
yes werent they
preacher did a fine job
i give it aehhhhh
really you thought so
great now we get some
dramatic criticism
too much talk about
poetry and teaching
he hadnt written any poetry
to speak of since 65
he never liked teaching worth a damn
nobody talked about the good stuff
man was a worldclass alcoholic
moren fifty years
nobody told the story about that night he got
wrangled into giving a talk at that tu alumni dinner
drank a whole bottle of
ron bocoy white rum
dont know why i remember that
and got up to give this talk
and he fouled himself
comes back to our table with this great
yeah i cant imagine why no one told that story
well he didnt get invited back to
anymore tu alumni dinners
i can tell you that
i dont know much
about poetry but
i thought his poems
were extraordinary
and your reading was very fine
thank you
who are you
this is my fiance steve
you met him at the church
steve heidebrecht
hidethewhat
heidebrecht
hideaburrrits german
well germanirish really
thats peculiar karen
to bring a date to
your fathers funeral

wouldnt have considered it date material
hes not a date hes my fiance

if you can make it
i dont really see that
happening do you
steve

dr burke the chemotherapy and radiation

pain medications

and without the benefit of more
thorough testing
an mri or ct scan
i believe your mother is suffering
from mild cognitive impairment
mild cognitive impairment
brain damage
it may be time to consider placing
her in a long term care facility
i know id feel more comfortable if i know
she was receiving that level of supervision
and where would you
have us put her
a psychiatric hospital
well beverlys gone
well not so much as gone
as dead but i see your point
legal guardianship for you and your
sisters with my recommendation

cooperated with this
commitment endaround

im sorry
mild cognitive impairment

barbara
the day the funeral

i dont have that many hiding places
nowmom come on
you wanna search me

i just need a few days
to get my feet under me
i want you to know youre not alone
if you need any help
i dont need help
i wanna help
i dont need your help
mom
i dont need your help
ive gotten myself
i know how this goes
once all the talkings through
people go back to their own
nonsense
i know that so
dont worry about me ill manage
i get by
remember when we checked her in the
psych ward that stunt she pulled
big speech
shes getting clean making this
incredible sacrifice for her family
shes let us down but now
shell prove shes a good mother
she smuggled darvocet
into the psych ward
in her vagina
theres your greatest
generation for you
shes giving this speech
to us while she was
clenching a bottle of pills
in her cooch
ive never heard this story
did you just say cooch
the phrase moms pussy
seems gauche
youre a little more comfortable
with cooch are you
what word should i use to describe
our mothers vagina
i dont know barb
moms beaver
mothers box
oh god barbara
one thing about mom and dad
you have to tip your cap to anybody
who can stay married that long
karen he killed himself
we dont know that for sure
is there something going on between
you and little charles
i dont know that im comfortable
talking about that
because hes our first cousin you know
give me a break
you know you shouldnt
consider children
i cant anyway
i had a hysterectomy last year
why
cervical cancer
i didnt know
neither did i
i didnt tell anyone
except charles
thats where it started between us
why not
and hear it from mom the rest of my life
she doesnt need another excuse to
treat me like some damaged thing
you might have told us
you didnt tell us about you and bill
thats different
why
because its you and not me
because divorce is an embarrassing
public admission of defeat
cancers fucking cancer
you cant help that
were your sisters
i dont feel that
connection very keenly
i feel very connected
to both of you
we never see you
youre never around
you havent been around
i still feel that connection
i cant perpetuate these myths of family
or sisterhood anymore
were just people some of us
accidentally connected by genetics
a random selection of cells
when did you get so cynical
thats funny coming from you
well bitter yes but
random selection of cells
maybe my cynicism came with the
realization that the responsibility
of caring for our
parents was mine alone
dont give me that i participated
till you had enough and got out
you and karen both im not criticizing
do what you want
you did karen did
and if you didnt
thats not my fault
thats right so dont lay this sister
thing on me all right
when i leave here i wont feel
any more guilty than you two did
i cant believe
your world view is this dark
you live in florida
youre thinking of leaving
yeah
charles and i are
going to new york
what are you going
to do in new york
we have plans
like what
none of your business
what about mom
what about her
you feel comfortable leaving her here
do you
youre going back to miami right
yes i cant stay
there you go barb
you want to know what were doing about mom
karen and i are leaving
you want to stay thats your decision
but nobody gets to point a finger at me
nobody
my three girls
all together
hearing you just now
gave me a warm feeling
you had a bath
yeah
you want something to eat
some coffee
im fine honey thank you
ill bet this house must have heard
a lot of weston girl secrets
i get embarrassed
just thinking about it
oh nothing to be
embarrassed about
secret crushes secret schemes
i cant imagine anything more
delicate or bittersweet
some part of you girls
i always identified with
no matter how old you get
a womans hardpressed to throw off
that part of herself
that smells so good
its apple you want some
sure i do
hey did i ever tell you
the story of raymond qualls
thats a boy i had a crush on
when i was thirteen or so
roughlooking boy
beatup jeans and messy hair
terrible underbite
but he had these
beautiful cowboy boots
shiny chocolate leather
he was so proud of those boots
you could tell the way
hed strut around all arms and
elbows puffed up and cocksure
i convinced myself that i needed to
get a girly pair of those boots
and i was sure if i did that
that hed ask me to go steady
you know hed see me in those boots
and say thats the gal for me
oh gosh
so i found the boots
in a window downtown
and i just went crazy
praying for those boots
im rehearsing the
conversation that id have with
raymond when he saw me in my boots
mustve asked my momma a hundred
times if i could get those boots
vi what do you
want for christmas
momma ill give all of it up just
to have those boots bargaining
so she started laying little hints around
about box a package under the tree
she had wrapped up
about the size of a boot box
real nice wrapping paper
now vi dont you cheat
and dont you go in there
before christmas morning
little smile on her face
christmas morning i was up like a shot boy
under the tree
i was tearing the paper
there were boots in there
mens work boots
holes in the toes
chewed up laces and
caked in mud
caked in mud and dog shit
lord
my momma laughed for days
please dont tell me
thats the end of the story
oh no that
thats the end
you never got the boots
no huhuh
my momma was a mean
nastymean old lady
i suppose thats where i get it
from
youre not nastymean
youre our mother and we love you
is the coast clear
never very
what are you watching
television
can i watch it with you
i wish you would
are you mad at me
nope
i was trying to be brave
i know
i just i want everyone to know
that i got what i always wanted
and that means im not a loser
hey  hey
youre my hero
i wrote this for you
sit down
well ive never been a
man of many words
and theres nothing i could say
that you havent never heard
but ill sing you love songs
till the day i die
the way im feeling
i cant keep it inside
ill sing a sweet serenade whenever
youre feeling sad
and a lullaby each night
before you go to bed
ill sing to you for the rest of your life
liberace
you better get yourself together
we have to get home and take care
of those damn dogs
theyve probably eaten
the drapes by now
im sure the house is fine
oh look honey little charles has got the tv on
this one watches so
much television
its rotted his brain
im sure thats not true
what was it i caught you
watching the other day
i dont remember
you do so remember
some dumb talk show about
people swapping wives
i dont remember
too bad there isnt a job where they
pay you to sit around watching tv
cmon mattie fae
yknow he got fired from a shoe store
mattie fae
were gonna get in
the car and go home
and if you say one more mean
thing to that boy
im going to kick
your fat irish ass
onto the highway
what the hell did you say to me
you kids go outside
would you please
i dont understand this meanness
i look at you and your sister
and the way you talk to people
and i dont understand it
i cant understand why
folks cant be
respectful of one another
i dont think theres
any excuse for it
my family didnt treat each other that way
maybe thats because your family
you had better not say anything about
my family right now i mean it
we buried a man i loved very much
and whatever faults
he may have had
he was a good kind
decent man
and to hear you tear
into your own son
not even a day later that
dishonors beverlys memory
weve been married
thirtyeight years
and i wouldnt trade them
for anything
ut if you cant find a
generous place in your heart
for your own son
were not going to make
it to thirtynine
i didnt mean to eavesdrop
i froze
thats
you have a cigarette hon
no i quit years ago
so did i
just sounded good to me
i thought at dinner
at that horrible
dinner seemed like
something might be going on between
ivy and little charles
do you know if thats true
im not sure
just
is it true
yes its true
okay
that cant happen
this is going to be difficult
uh ivy and little
charles have always
marched to their own and id
expect this to be toughest on you
barb
theyre in love
they think they are i know its
unorthodox for cousins to get together
at least these days
theyre not cousins
beg pardon
little charles is not your cousin
hes your brother
hes your blood brother
half brother
hes your fathers child
which means that he
is ivys brother
do you see
go away
were just going to
go away  now  go away
all righalright
you and dad
who knows this
i do and you do
uncle charlie doesnt suspect
weve never discussed it
what
weve never discussed it okay
did dad know
yes
yknow im not proud of this
really
you people amaze me
what were you drunk was this just some
i wasnt drunk no
maybe its hard for you to believe
looking at me knowing me the way
you do all these years i mean i know to you
im just your old fat aunt mattie fae
im more than that sweetheart
theres more to me than that
i dont know why little charles
is such a disappointment to me
maybe he
well i dont know why
im disappointed for him
more than anything
i made a mistake a long time ago
okay i paid for it
but the mistake ends here
if ivy found out
it would destroy her
im sure as hell not
gonna tell her
you have to find a way to stop it
you have to put a stop to it
hold it
dont let it out
thats a kick huh
if you wont look
theres no point in showing them to you
okay okay
ill look
youre gonna get us
both in trouble
im white and over thirty
i dont get in trouble
oh my god
oh my god
goddamn it
stop it
stop stop
what is wrong with you
steve
what happened
she was messing with jean
baby are you okay
jean what are you doing up
do i need to call a doctor
i dont know
johnna whats going on
he was messing with jean
so i tuned him up
messing with what do you mean
messing with
he was kissing and grabbing her
ill murder you you prick
you know how old that girl is
shes fourteen years old
i didnt do anything
are you out of your goddamn mind
just back off barbara
that sonofabitch is a sociopath
what is the matter with you
will you please stop freaking out
why dont you start
at the beginning
what are you even doing up
sweetheart we need to know what went on here
nothing went on
nothing okay can we not turn
everything a federal case here okay
i came down smoked a little pot
smoked a little pot and
we were just goofing around and then
everything just got a little bit crazy
what have i told you about smoking that shit
then johnna just chose to attack him with a shovel
just tell me what he did
he didnt do anything
whats the big deal
the big deal jean
is that youre fourteen years old
just a few years younger than
you like em
i hate you
whats the matter with you
jean
i can do without a speech
where is he
out at the car were leaving
back to florida tonight now
me and steve together
you wannna give me some grief about that
now you wait goddamn it
you better find out from jean
exactly what went on
before you start pointing fingers
because i doubt jeans
blameless in all this
and im not saying
that i blame her
just cause i said shes not blameless
it doesnt mean ive blamed her
im saying she might
share in the responsibility
its not cut and dried
it lives where everything lives
somewhere in the middle
where the rest of us live
everyone but you
karen
im no angel myself
ive done some things
im not proud of
things youll never know about
and i may even have to do some
things im not proud of again
cause life puts you
in a corner that way
anyway
you have your own hash to settle
before you start making
speeches to the rest of us
and come january
ill be in belize
doesnt that sound nice
im taking jean with me heading
back to colorado in the morning
youre never coming back to me

mom

i knew the whole time
bev and mattie fae were carrying on
charlie should have known too
if he wasnt smoking all that grass
its the pills talking

your father tore
himself up over it
thirty someodd years but
beverly wouldnt have been beverly if
he didnt have plenty to brood about
mom what are you about

you never know when someone
might need a kidney
why in gods name
did you tell me this
hey what do you care
youre monsters

whos the injured party here
ivy listen
you will never see me again
mattie fae told me
i didnt know what to do
i was trying to protect you
well go anyway
well still go away
this is not my fault
mom told you it wasnt me it was mom
theres no difference
ivyivy
ivy
we couldnt let ivy run off
with little charles
just wouldnt be right
shell be back
shes a sweet girl ivy
and i love her to death but
she isnt strong
not like you
or me
you knew about daddy
and mattie fae
oh sure
sure
but i never told them i knew
but your father knew
he knew i knew
but we never talked about it
i chose the higher ground
if id had the chance
there at the end
i wouldve
i wouldve told him
i hope this isnt about little charles
cause you know i know
all about that
if id reached him at that motel
i wouldve said
youd be better off if you quit
sulking about this
ancient history
what motel
i called over there on monday
after i got into that safety deposit box
but it was too late
hed checked out
how did you know where he was
the note he said i could call him
over at the country squire motel
he left a note
and i did i called
over there on monday
after you got your money
out of your safety deposit box
we had
an arrangement
you have to understand
for people like your father and me
who never had any money
ever as kids
people from our generation
that money is important
if you couldve stopped daddy
from killing himself you wouldnt have
needed to get into your safety deposit box
well hindsights always twenty
twenty isnt it
did the note say he was
going to kill himself
mom
if i had my
wits about me maybe
i mightve done it different but
i was
your father and me both
we were
you were both fuckedup
you were fuckedup
you are fuckedup
youd better understand this
you smug little ingrate
theres only  one reason beverly
killed himself and thats you
think theres any way he wouldve done
what he did if you were still here
no
just him and me
in this house alone in the dark
abandoned wasted lifetimes
devoted to your care and comfort
oh yes
you stick that knife of judgment in me
go ahead but make no mistake
his blood is just as much on
your hands as it is on mine
he did this though
this is his doing not ours
can you imagine anything more cruel
to make me responsible
why
just to weaken me
make me prove my character
so no i waited i waited to get my
hands on that safety deposit box
but i would have waited anyway
you want to show
whos stronger bev
nobodys stronger than me goddamn it
when nothing is left
when everything is gone
and disappeared
ill be here
whos stronger now
you sonofabitch
youre right mom
youre the strong one
