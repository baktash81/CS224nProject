that was a hell of a shot 
well  i m currently doing an
externship for two extra credits
as a clerk for judge hookstratten

than being in the top 5

the top five  sir  in my class 
not the top 5  
i m sorry  i just

that are fortune 500 companies 
now  look  we ll offer you  74  000   
   our billing requirement for a
first year associate is only 2 000 hours 
not the usual 25 or 26 or 2 700 
we want you to have a
life outside the office  mitch 
and if you re a lakers fan 
we have a fabulous box at the forum 
i know there are firms
from all over the country
that have been up here
offering you everything 
but with your ability and ambition 
there is only one place for you 
and that s with our
firm in washington   
let s stop talking
about the ribbon on the package 
and start talking about
what s in the package 
one of our partners is an
ex governor  two are congressmen
and one s a former
senator of agriculture 
may i take your coat  sir 
  mitchell mcdeere  right

lamar quinn  come on in 
i d like you to meet
  oliver lambert  our senior partner 
  mitch  mitch

  our managing partner 
  how do you do  sir 
  welcome 
  care for a drink 
  no  i m fine 
  take a seat  mitch 
tired of interviews 
no  sir  i just don t
quite know what to say 
unusual for a lawyer 
i can get tongue tied in any
number of situations  sir 
but it s usually with my wife 
would you mind describing one 
with your wife 
the first time i saw her 
any time we argue 
whenever she walks into a room 
as a matter of fact 
might we ask
about the rest of your family 
my father was killed
in the coal mines
and my mother remarried
and lives in florida 
brothers and sisters 
none 
mitch  i hope you don t
think us intrusive 
but stability in the family
has a special importance for us 
bendini  lambert   locke
is just a small memphis firm 
41 lawyers 
but we re a large family 
so we re careful 
now  sir  do you have
any questions for us 
do you have an offer in mind 
it includes a bonus schedule 
a low interest mortgage
so you can buy a home 
country club membership 
and we ll lease you a new mercedes 
you pick the color  mitch 
lamar  you haven t been
paying attention 
his wife picks the color 
  do i    do i open it here 
  of course 
unless you can tell us what s in it 
a lawyer worth that offer
shouldn t have to open the envelope 
mr  mcknight  you are
the managing partner
at bendini  lambert   locke 
is that correct 
yes 
did mr  lambert  as senior partner 
give you any instructions
regarding my employment 
he did 
and  mr  mcknight  do you usually
follow mr  lambert s instructions 
objection 
vague  ambiguous 
sustained 
what precisely were
those instructions 
that you were in great demand 
and i should make certain
that we obtained your services before
a bidding situation developed 
how did you go about making certain 
i bribed a clerk in the harvard
law placement office
for the exact amount
of the highest offer 
and then added 20  
mitch  the letter you got
from bendini  lambert   locke
was the only one sent out 
we want you 
okay 
you re gonna have to leave now 
i m expecting my husband

our little firm here in memphis 
meanwhile  he s gonna try
not to be embarrassed
while i remind you that he s about to

well  here s a quote 
 the firm does not forbid me to take
a job  and they encourage children  
ask me why

one day the owner
got a notice from the irs 
he was an immigrant 
didn t know much english 
even less about withholding tax 
he went bankrupt 
lost his store 
that was the first time
i thought of being a lawyer 
in other words  you re an idealist 
i don t know any tax lawyer
who s an idealist 
when he lost his store  i lost my job 
and it scared me 
  being out of work 
  no 
what the government
can do to anybody 
what about you 
what led you to law school 
it s so far back
i don t think i can remember 
sure you can  counselor 
i used to caddie for young lawyers
off from work on weekdays
and their wives 
i d look at those long tan legs
and just knew i had to be a lawyer 
the wives had long tan legs  too 
ellis  another martini  please 
so we re not a couple of idealists

they do that with new associates 
i guess 
  i ve just been with them now   
  eight weeks 
sorry  guys 
i m just a little punchy 
that firm looks like
a health hazard 
  hours they make you keep 
  kind of work they make you do 
kozinski and hodges 
bob lamm and alice krauss 
that s four dead lawyers out of 41
in less than 10 years 
and none of them
over the age of what  45 
i mean  that beats the hell out of any life
insurance tables i ve ever heard about 
who are you guys 
could we get those
sandwiches to go  please 
we ll probably see each other again 
the car wouldn t start 
i got
caught in this incredible accident 
12 cars  maybe 13 
there was a pregnant woman
in one of them 
i had to help deliver the baby 
it was a girl 
they said they re gonna
name her abigail 
come on  abby  why do you think
i m working like this  huh 
   cause i want you to have all the stuff   
  wait a minute 
wait a minute 
i never asked for anything  mitch 
except for us to be together 
but i want to give it to you 
i want to give you everything
you gave up to marry me 
stop it 
it s sweet  i know 
it s some kind of courtship 
but i don t need all that 
just bring me flowers sometime 
what were you working on all night 
just  you know  it s   
it s just this stuff avery s got
me doing for the cayman trip 
hey  want to have some eggs 
i had some eggs 
want to have some naked 
you don t even know
what moves me about you  do you 
mitch  i know what you want 
but it s not for me 
it s not even for you 
and you know it 
it s easy for somebody rich
to talk about being poor
like it s some fly that s bothering
you and you just wave it away 
this isn t about rich or poor 
this is about trying to fix something
that won t get fixed with 10 mercedes 
hey  that s not fair  abby 
that s not fair 
this is about a mother
in a trailer park 
and a brother you
pretend you don t have 
have a nice trip 
just follow me 
and don t over breathe 
what about sonny capps 
i thought we were under
a lot of pressure 
we re under
tremendous pressure 
if we don t get this dive in
before the bank  we can t do it 
you can t dive and then
fly within 24 hours 
i don t see how you can dive
so soon after the accident 
we don t even know what happened
to kozinski and hodges 
hey  there was a
plane crash last week 
we didn t take a boat
to the caymans  did we 
that s ridiculous  sonny 
let us sit down with you
for five minutes  thank you 
son of a bitch pays less than 5  tax
and wants to fire us  the hyatt 
this new plan
is very aggressive  sonny 
and it defers all your tax liability for
years  and you could start right away 
i m sorry  sweetheart 
i can t talk right now 
these taxes are only deferred  right 
the future value of the tax dollars will
be less than half their present value 
  who says 
  after the election   
are you telling me who s gonna be in
the white house the next four years 
 cause that would be
valuable information 
  well   
  mr  tolar has a plan that   
that meets all your needs 
whoever s in the white house 
  let him tell me 
  he s been trying to 
hey  who the fuck are you 
his lawyer or mine 
  neither one  sir 
  what the fuck are you doing here 
sonny  you re not the firm s
only concern here 
we put you into deals
with other clients
where they may be very sensitive
about exposing their relationships
to outside attorneys 
you hear that  counselor 
that s a veiled threat 
if you re talking about our friends
in chicago 
they don t make money
when i pay you fees 
you make money when i pay you fees 
they make money
being in business with me 
and as long as
they re making money 
they don t give a flying fuck
who does my taxes 
hey  you don t know me 
i m a nice guy 
you lose a million bucks for me 
i m not gonna hurt you 
i m not gonna break your legs 
sonny  let s don t get carried
away here  all right 
what did i say 
maybe it s what you didn t say 
   what i didn t say   what didn t i say 
  thank you 
mr  tolar handed you a schedule
that virtually guarantees you
zero tax with zero risk 
the basis of your stock would be the
face amount of the installment note 
but the stock would have no value 
even so  it s deducted
in offsets income 
you defer your tax in full
even though you have a bankable lc 
  deferred till when 
  what do you care 
whenever it is  it s still the best
interest free loan you ll ever get 
so the worst is  i pay my
taxes much  much later 
no 
the worst thing is next year
they re going to close the loophole 
change the regs and if
you haven t grabbed this proposal 
you re gonna feel like
you were fucked
with a dick big enough
for an elephant to feel it 
you know that for a fact 
hey  you like the word  protege  
i never had one  you ever been one 
i m a  you re b  right next door 
avery  who s in chicago 
we ll get to all that 
the hell with it 
clean up and come on over 
you earned a good dinner
and a night out 
hey 
i lost my son 
don t you think i would have
screamed bloody murder
if i thought something was wrong 
you re right  mr  abanks  i m sorry 
okay  you re right  i m sorry 
nothing to bury even 
just a stone 
they never did find him
or the other two 
what other two 
the other two who split the charter 
your friends and two other guys 
  lawyers 
  they were in swim suits 
they paid cash 
were they american 
could have been anything 
one was  i don t know  squat  heavy 
other guy had long blond hair 
almost white  with weird blue eyes 
  mitch 
  yeah 
grab a red stripe out of the fridge 
i m a little slow 
take your time 
i m trying to look as pretty as you 
which i m convinced i can 
it just takes me a little longer 
you got anything to munch on 
yeah  there s a thing full of
stuff next to the fridge 
it s got a lock on it  use that key
from the ring i gave you 
do you see it 
yeah  sure 
you find something 
listen  capps is a tough guy 
but he s also a blowhard 
he loves to give the impression
that he s connected 
thinks it s glamorous 
he said a couple of things 
hey  you re about to
take the bar exam 
here s a multiple choice 
the difference between tax
avoidance and tax evasion is   
a  whatever the irs says 
b  a smart lawyer 
c  10 years in prison 
d  all of the above 
being a tax lawyer s
got nothing to do with the law 
it s a game 
we teach the rich how to play it 
so they can stay rich 
the irs keeps changing the rules
so we can keep getting rich
teaching them 
it s a game  one you just
played very  very well 
where s your beer 
i decided to wait for the rum 
i hear it s good down here 
everything s good down here 
you deserve a taste of all of it 
i think that since we re
here on this island 
there s things we can do on it 
you know  primitive things 
come on  you deserve it 
look  i don t mean to hurt your
feelings  but this isn t gonna happen 
would you tell my friend
i went back to the condo 
you don t know what you re missing 
thanks anyway 
  leave me alone 
  listen to me 
are you all right 
it s okay 
just wait a minute 
wait a minute 
can i look at this 
you re not a doctor 
no  but i ve
sprained a lot of ankles 
mostly mine 
you should ice this 
you should also report that guy 
that was your boyfriend 
that was for money 
oh 
  aren t you gonna finish 
  i m sorry 
  you think that s   
  got nothing to do with me 
  is this too tight 
  no 
i work in a travel agency 
i wanted to feel like
all those people
with first class tickets
and pretty clothes 
i guess i wanted to feel   
rich 
how much would it
take to feel rich 
i don t know 
how much would it take to feel safe 
you did that 
you made me feel safe 
hey   
will you stay with me for a while 
why don t you take the afternoon off 
you deserve it 
spend it with that
pretty wife of yours 
oh  shit  i forgot 
she phoned last night

  do you ever talk to ma

  still with the same guy 
  they re all the same guy 
so  you finish law school

that suit s a dead give away 
what  you get a job on wall street 
  you always said   
  no  i m not  i just   
i went with a firm across
the river in memphis 
memphis 
hey  ray 
wouldn t it be funny
if i went to harvard and you went to jail
and we both ended up
surrounded by crooks 
sonny capps is thrilled 
mcdeere was dazzling 
i think we ought to pull lamar
out of that tax seminar in washington
and send mitch instead 
let him take the jet 
any problem with that  bill 
no  no  no problem 
so far the kid s been
real predictable 
if you re even half right  you re gonna
need some help  what does abby think 
i haven t told her 
i guess   
i guess i don t want it to be real 
nothing s real until
i tell it to abby

  thank you  dear 
that s my secretary 
she is terrific 
but she s got a nutcase for
a husband  he s a truck driver 
he moved here
to be close to graceland 
the reason why 
he thinks he s elvis 
what do you think his name is 
it s elvis  elvis aaron hemphill 
i run across some strange
things in this job 
some things i d never
spray paint on an overpass 
now  what can i do for you 
  what a nice surprise 
  avery 
they didn t have to disturb you 
you didn t have to come down 
believe me  it s no bother 
i was just looking for mitch 
nina says he hasn t
been in all afternoon 
i didn t mean for her to call you 
didn t he come back with you 
i ll be honest with you 
this is not my area of expertise 
  but you think it s possible 
  anything s possible 
i ll tell you one thing  if those guys
at the steak joint were feds 
you better watch out for them 
 cause they don t give
a damn about you 
i get some pretty pissed
off husbands in here 
on the other hand  the lawyers at your
firm sure as hell seem accident prone 
okay 
i ll see what i can find out 
you better let me call you 
you sure remind me of your brother 
ray comes up for parole in a while 
says that he can last it 
what do you think 
there s guys that can do all the
hard time the state gives them 
whatever ray had 
he used up to get this far 
  hi 
  hi 
  i didn t think you were home 
  why not 
  no car 
  i took it in for service 
avery brought me home 
i went to the office
looking for you 
i wasn t there 
apparently not 
i even looked under your desk 
  yeah  i went   
  avery told me you were at msu 
at the law library 
  avery did 
  avery did 
but when i happened to spot
your car in the parking lot 
it made him kind of edgy 
yeah  well  avery didn t
exactly know where i was 
oh 
probably thought you were
with another woman 
i went to see ray 
ray 
  yeah 
  just like that  after all this time 
you were right 
i ve been stupid 
i would have gone
with you on saturday 
i know  god  i just wasn t   
i wasn t thinking 
how d it go 
it was   
it was   
god  he   
he tried to make it easy for me 
is he okay 
he s gotta get that parole 
you want to try something 
let s put the books away 
pretend we re back in our
old beat up apartment  broke 
and we find some money
we forgot in pockets 
  we ll send out for pizza and drink beer 
  drink beer 
and watch star search 
who knows where it will lead 
your wife 
  she s in cleveland 
  she lies 
don t you answer your phone 
don t you knock 
where s your secretary 
out 
  she left a cigarette burning 
  she does that 
why don t you come back in one hour 
and make an appointment 
why bother  we re here 
i m busy 
doing what 
i m getting a pedicure 
what s it to you 
now this is gonna turn
out badly for you 
but we can make it
relatively painless 
why are you asking questions
about dead lawyers 
what dead lawyers 
who hired you to do that 
okay  okay 
just let me think 
his name was julio iglesias 
no  no 
great 
just great 
you want to ask him
a few questions now 
i think this is a carefully
balanced proposal 
i think it s high minded
and i think it s fair minded 
in other words  it s got something
in it to offend everyone 
if you want to follow
along with me 
we ll begin on page  i 
of the introduction 
we ll revue sections 704 b
of the irs code of 1986
and the treasury regulations
amended under section 1 704 1 
quote 
 the distribution provisions
 in limited and general
partnership agreements  
these regulations permit the irs
to disregard allocations
which are not made in accordance
with partners  interests
in the partnership
unless those allocations
satisfy the economic effect
most easily satisfied
by taking advantage of the safe
harbor provisions set forth therein 
in other words  in an
ever changing sea of tax laws   
hey  brother 
brother  go down the steps
towards the pool 
here you go  brother 
  voices from the wall 
  thanks a lot 
oh  yeah 
mister 
who killed eddie lomax 
go over and sit next to
the man on the bench 
i appreciate your coming 
mr  mcdeere 
i ll call you mitch  if i may 
my name is voyles 
denton voyles 
i m with the department of justice 
what happened to eddie lomax 
we ve been investigating bendini 
lambert   locke for four years 
no lawyer has ever
left your law firm alive 
two tried to leave 
they were killed 
two were about to try 
you know what happened 
now  we have reason to believe
that your house is bugged 
your phones are tapped 
your office is wired 
they may follow you  they may be here
in washington as we speak 
are you saying my life is in danger 
i m saying that
your life as you know it is over 
your law firm is the sole
legal representative
of the morolto crime
family in chicago 
known as the mafia 
the mob 
i don t believe it 
they set up legitimate businesses
with dirty money from drugs 
gambling  prostitution 
all cash  all moved
offshore  you believe it 
that s why you talked
to thomas abanks in the caymans 
that s why you got
this private investigator
asking questions that
got him killed 
maybe 30  of their
clients are legitimate 
they bring in a new rookie 
throw money at him 
buy the car  the house 
after a couple of years 
and your kids are in private schools 
you re used to the good life 
they tell you the truth 
you mean every partner
in the firm is   
every partner knows 
we suspect most of the associates 
why don t you get indictments
and bust it all up 
we have to have
somebody on the inside 
we need to see copies of contracts 
clients  bank records 
  articles of incorporation 
  wait a minute 
  you think i m   
  you can say no 
but we re gonna break this firm 
and when that happens  you re gonna
go to jail along with the rest 
it will happen  son  believe me 
why can t i just leave 
that s what kozinski and
hodges were trying to do 
you have to think this over 
meanwhile  you and your wife have to
behave as though everything is normal 
now don t discuss this with anyone 
but make a decision 
if you help us 
we ll make it worth your while 
worth my while 
you can still have a
pretty good life 
you mean
in a witness protection program 
how 
i live somebody else s life 
in some nowhere place  and one day
i m backing out of my driveway
and my car explodes 
doesn t have to be that way 
i don t need much of a life 
mr  voyles  but it has to be mine 
is that what you ve got now  son 
you ought to get
back to the seminar 
tarrance has full authority
to negotiate on our behalf 
why don t you wander back
past the memorial 
you can call me in memphis anytime 
day or night 
the second one s a mobile number 
let me get this straight 
i steal files from the firm
and turn them over to the fbi 
testify against my colleagues 
send them to jail 
they suckered you into this 
reveal privileged information that
violates attorney client confidences 
get me disbarred  and then testify
in open court against the mafia 
  well  unfortunately  mitch   
  let me ask you something 
are you out of your fucking mind 
how long before they
find out lomax s cellmate
was a guy named ray mcdeere 
and when they do 
what do you think they ll do to him 
they can get to anyone  anywhere 
what can you do 
your brother comes up for
parole soon  doesn t he 
you cooperate with us  i ll
guarantee the board will be grateful 
otherwise    well  you know what
those parole hearings are like 
it could go either way 
forget about home  driver 
take me to the firm 
  the employer will have   
  mr  mcdeere  you can t go in there 
call everybody  right now 
  i m on overseas and i ve got two   
  right now 
i just had a little
chat with the fbi 
  and they didn t try to coerce you 
  no 
  they didn t offer you money 
  nope 
did they ask you to
contact them again 
what for 
exactly what did they want 
the secret files 
who had those secret files last 
you have them  royce 
  i gave them to you 
  no 
they also suggested that hodges
and kozinski were murdered 
those sons of bitches 
now  we ought to build a case
and sue  this is pure harassment 
and that was it 
that was everything that was said 
well  i mean 
as far as i can remember 
it wasn t exactly
a sequential conversation 
there was a lot of yelling 
mostly by me 
mitch  we re always doing
battle with the government 
if it isn t the justice department 
it s the irs  and you know what 
we beat them every time 
and they hate us for it 
they can t get to us
so they pick on somebody new 
they invite you to break the law 
doesn t cost them anything 
but it costs you everything 
now  i don t want you
to worry about this 
it s gotten serious enough 
we ll have to get into it legally 
i guess the only other question is 
who do we bill this hour to 
how about the fbi 
i can t believe that 
that is so weird 
i was just thinking about you 
somebody s burning leaves
outside  did you smell it 
it reminded me of the time   
hey 
if you re afraid you ll wake the kids 
we don t have any 
abby 
abby 
abby 
  abby 
  don t say anything  don t say anything 
don t tell me any more 
everything 
every single thing we ve said or
done since we ve been in that house 
nothing has been between us 
can t we just get in our own car
and drive back to boston  tonight 
  we ll just leave everything 
  they d find us 
how do you go to work tomorrow 
how do you look at avery 
what do you say to him 
i talk about work 
  that s insane 
  i have thought of every possible way 
here  in the caymans  in
washington  that s all i ve done 
try to think of a way out  if we run 
they d find us  and it gets ray killed 
  but if you testify   
  the fbi says they ll help ray
  and protect us 
  protect what 
what are you going to do 
go in tomorrow and
start to copy files 
i don t have a choice 
mitch 
what are you saying 
you ll be revealing
clients  secrets 
  you ll be disbarred 
  abby  don t   
you ll never be able to practice
law again for the rest of your life 
everything you ve worked for 
they can t ask you to do that 
they are not asking 
we have to behave
exactly as we have been 
we have to go to work
and come home every day
and never wonder about the
walls and the wires   
and do nothing we want to do 
szechwan beef from wong boys 
that was the last time
i remember laughing 
  come on  every single day we got   
  oh  not you again  man 
   one of your trucks out here 
blocking this alley 
  hey  leave me alone 
  what s it gonna take  huh 
hey  would you leave
me alone  buddy 
you re using
this place as a parking lot 
what the hell are you doing 
jesus  i was just trying
to make a copy of   
they just started this  you have to
have the billing code for each client 
you mean every time
i copy a piece of paper  it s recorded 
what are you trying to do 
kill yourself 
come on 
nina should do that anyway 
come down for one night  can t you 
well  it used to be worth it 
okay 
yeah  maybe next time 
bye  cordelia 
that was cordelia 
yeah  your wife 
from the song of the same name 
avery  i have a couple of ideas
about those capps lcs 
when s the next cayman trip 
for me  next week 
if you think i m gonna let sonny capps
get another look at you  you re crazy 
but you write down
every single thought you have 
i ll be happy to take credit 
mr  mcdeere  mr  mulholland s
called twice about his bills again 
tell mr  mulholland
to take his bill and   
no  wait a minute  wait a minute 
isn t he just up the street 
  yes  in the cotton exchange 
  cotton exchange 
tell him i ll see him later 
did you order a fried egg sandwich
from the front street deli 
a fried egg   
yes  i did  i did 
come in 
it s  2 65 
the receipt s in the bag 
the receipt s in the bag 
how did you see them 
and they didn t see you 
i was under the desk 
i was vacuuming the rug 
you want me to draw you a diagram 
i loved him 
i m sorry  tammy 
they wanted to know who hired him
and why he was asking questions
about dead lawyers 
you actually saw them 
one guy was stocky 
looked like a wrestler 
he s gonna limp the rest of his life
 cause eddie hit him in the knee
with that cannon under his desk 
and the other guy
was like an albino 
long thin hair 
almost white 
dead blue eyes 
my landlady said
they came looking for me yesterday 
so i checked into the motel 6
on river street 
i couldn t think of
anywhere else to go 
listen  they re gonna put eddie
together with ray  and when they do 
it ll lead to you 
i don t want anything
bad to happen to you 
eddie wouldn t like it 
so  you re in as much
trouble as i am 
listen  there s a building around
the corner called the cotton exchange 
maybe you can help  tammy 
hi there  mitch 
bill devasher  firm security 
mr  locke and mr  lambert were telling
me about your little run in with the fbi 
i wonder if we could
have a little talk 
actually  i told them everything 
i m sure you did 
this won t take a minute 
hop in 
so  mitch 
this is a debriefing 
i know pretty much
what you told the fellows 
so i kind of got the picture 
now it s my job to
give you the picture 
what i m concerned about 
son  is this 
the fbi wouldn t have come after you
if they didn t figure they d get to you 
what do you suppose
made them think that 
i have no idea 
well  see  it s my job
to have an idea about that 
for example  they might know how
important your young wife is to you 
they might use that 
how 
avery says last friday
you took the afternoon off 
he figures you might have been
with another woman 
  why would avery think   
  how do you know
you weren t followed 
picture abby one day
walking to the mail box 
anticipating the arrival of her redbook 
her sharper image catalog 
what does she find instead 
she finds heartache  mitch 
the death of love and trust 
imagine her one day opening that 
go ahead 
take a look 
devastating 
not just screwing  mitch 
but the kind of intimate acts 
oral and whatnot 
that can be particularly hard
for a trusting young wife to forgive
and impossible to forget 
that s just the kind of stuff the
fbi could use for coercion  mitch 
so you watch yourself 
i ll do the best i can
to protect you 
and i know you will do your best
to protect the firm 
so if the fbi so much
as spits in your direction 
you ll let me know before
it hits the ground  won t you 
won t you  mitch 
oliver wants to see you right now
in the library  where you been 
let me just put my coat away 
right now 
he s been waiting 
you think you re pretty smart 
don t you 
well  we ve been informed
there s somebody smarter 
you didn t get the highest score
on the bar exam 
you got the second highest score 
cheers 
nice one 
congratulations 
they called you  huh 
guilty  your honor 
i did it 
well  it s your moment of glory 
you know  my wife missed mine 
and she never forgave herself 
i wouldn t want that
to happen to you 
  that s very considerate  avery 
  well  i thought so 
well done  well done 
  quite an achievement  mitch 
  abby 
well  the space is just great 
i ll take it 
and the lease would be under   
greenwood secretarial services 
and you are   
  doris greenwood  i like that suit a lot 
  well  thank you 
they re gonna deliver
a copier tomorrow 
  i ll make sure the office is open 
  all right 
i will employ such means only as are
consistent with truth and honor 
i will employ such means only as
are consistent with truth and honor 
i will maintain the confidence
and preserve inviolate
the secrets of my client 
i will maintain the confidence
and preserve inviolate
the secrets of my client 
i will truly and honestly conduct myself
in the practice of my profession
to the best of my skill and ability 
so help me god 
 i will maintain the confidence
and preserve inviolate
 the secrets of my client  
the first thing i m gonna do
is violate the secrets of my clients 
do you see any other way 
okay  then  aren t we
doing the best we can 
no 
what do you mean 
i can t 
what 
that   
that night   
that night in the caymans
when you telephoned   
you were on the beach 
what 
what did you do 
no 
you didn t   
who was she 
  i don t know 
  you don t know 
i don t even know her name 
it didn t mean anything 
like hell it didn t 
it means everything 
what did you do 
why did you fuck some stranger
on a beach one night away from me 
who does that 
  abby  i promise you   
  what 
you can t promise anything 
not ever  not anymore 
why did you tell me 
because i couldn t stand not to 
i couldn t stand your not knowing 
well  now i know 
give me the keys 
sorry  i   
just give me the keys 
i thought
there were only two brothers grimm 
sit down  avery 
anthony and joey
are coming down next week 
  what for 
  works out your protégé s got a brother 
so 
he didn t mention him
at the interview in boston 
i ve got a brother
i might not mention either
  in polite conversation 
  this brother s doing time 
how did you find that out 
what do you think i am here 
a fucking night watchman 
i get confused sometimes 
  well  don t 
  all right  avery 
we got a prison guard in
arkansas  he s on the arm 
he tells us about a ray mcdeere
doing time for manslaughter 
the moroltos have been edgy ever
since the kozinski and hodges mess 
they re concerned that we
might be misreading mcdeere 
and the moroltos are
coming for what 
  to personally take over 
  are we misreading him 
i don t think so 
wouldn t you lie if you had a felon
in the family to get a job like this 
i still think we ought to
keep him on a pretty tight leash 
why  you ve got nothing to be
suspicious about 
i get paid to be suspicious when
i got nothing to be suspicious about 
excuse me 
you re not listening 
mr  mcdeere 
i m sorry 
you were talking about hours 
listen  i know i m not bendini lambert s
most valuable client 
but i ve got a legitimate
complaint here 
you never spent 33 hours
last month on my account 
is that what you were billed 
you don t see your own bills 
no  i just submit my time sheet 
where is it 
it s on file with
the office manager 
you know  this overbilling s
gotten so common
nobody gives it another thought 
it s kind of like tipping 
well  it s not policy 
mr  mulholland 
it sure seems like policy  it s
been going on over there for years 
people forget something else  too 
when somebody over there
put a stamp on this and mailed it 
you know what happened 
  it became a federal offense 
  it became a federal offense 
you re damn right 
each instance punishable by   
 10 000 fine 
three to five years each instance 
nina  i m going over to mulholland s
for a half hour or so 
all righty 
  wait a minute  wait a minute 
  i got the beeper 
i think there might be
a way of doing this
without getting disbarred
and without breaking the law 
is that our chief concern here 
tear those up 
i might not have to use them 
but i got to get to
that stuff in the caymans 
what  for the fbi 
no  for me 
they won t let you go  you said 
somebody s gonna have
to get to it another way 
it has to happen fast 
i got to figure out what
to do about ray 
what 
in eddie s stuff  is there some
kind of wireless recording device 
yes  yes 
you know how to use it 
whenever eddie said 
 my associate   yours truly 
did he have any high speed
camera equipment 
sure 
i want you to get
hold of a van  tammy 
hey  tammy  did elvis
ever find out about eddie 
oh  man  he loved eddie 
are you kidding 
hell  that stuff was over
between me and elvis when i was 18 
we d been married two years 
and one morning at breakfast
i just turned too old for him 
but i tell you  everybody loves elvis 
the man s a panda 
and he d do anything for me 
they re off 
and say something comes away on top
and right there is
stepping over on the inside 
champagne now rushes up   
doesn t a dog ever get the bone 
yeah  i hear it happens once in a while 
it s a disaster 
they can never get that
dog to run again 
listen  mitch 
mr  voyles wants me to tell you
how much the bureau appreciates   
a million dollars in a numbered
account in switzerland 
ibg bank international in zurich 
well  you sure as hell
turned greedy overnight 
and my brother out 
now 
your brother is a
convicted felon  mitch 
then get yourself another snitch 
he s in for manslaughter 
it was a brawl in a bar 
if he hadn t done any boxing 
it would have been self defense 
it s still a felony  mitch 
you heard me  tarrance 
my brother out now 
and make it a million and a half 
how about you get down on your knees
and kiss my ass
for not indicting you
as a co conspirator right now

found a way out

it s more like a way through 
it s a long shot  but it s   
well  it s legal 
i know it s weird  but if we follow
the law  it just might save us

during the great steamboat era 
which was at its height in the 1870s 
these great floating palaces 
like the robert e  lee 
whose model you see here 
numbered by the hundreds
on the mississippi river 
the robert e  lee was actually
designed specifically
to travel on the mississippi river 
which is a shallow river   
follow me now to the
main deck of the boat
where the cargo would be carried
as well as the deck passengers 
the great rollers that
powered the steam engine
were situated here
on the main deck of the boat 
hey  mitch  mitch 
the end of the great steam era
and the advent of the railway 
the next gallery detailing   
we have here the working
steam engine off the us army
corps of engineers
snag boat  the arkansas ii 
now a steam engine works
by lighting a fire underneath the boilers
where the water is contained 
this heats the water
and turns it into steam 
because the kids wanted me
to bring them by 
why  what s the matter 
okay  oh  lamar  i just saw
mitch at mud island museum 
he was zipping through
like a tourist

lawyer on the face of the earth

together and charge me  1 000 an hour
while they send me to joliet

this kid s cut a deal
and i bet it s a beaut 
if i get my hands on this fucking kid 
joey  if i get my hands on this kid   
  excuse me 
  not now  ruthie 
i think it s urgent  mr  morolto 
ruthie thinks it s urgent 
what do you think  joey 
it s a mr  mcdeere 
mr  mitchell mcdeere 
he s waiting to see you 
i think ruth is right 
i m mitch mcdeere 
i m your attorney 
one of them  anyway 
i assume you knew  but i thought
i d mention it  in case 
  would you care to sit down 
  not really 
i want to try and   
this is just   
this is very awkward 
i m afraid my firm has behaved
in an unethical manner 
it seems that we 
bendini  lambert   locke 
the entire firm 
has been engaged in a   
well  a conspiracy 
we ve been
overbilling our clients 
in some cases  massive overbilling 
i assure you i had no idea any of this
was going on when i joined the firm 
well  i feel i have to report
this criminal behavior 
but i can t use   
i can t use your invoices
without your written authorization 
  our invoices 
  tony  please 
listen 
yes  sir  your bills 
you see  it s an important part of
the proof that we ve overbilled you 
that s it 
pretty much 
well  most of our clients have
already agreed  pretty much all 
except for you 
which is why i m here 
and this is what
you ve been talking to the fbi about 
you want us to let
you turn our bills   
what we charged you 
i should say overcharged you 
     over to the government 
  yes  sir 
  now  does that in any way   
  no  sir 
it does not in any way waive your rights
to full and complete confidentiality
in any other area of the
attorney client relationship 
i m your lawyer  gentlemen 
whether i like it or not  i can t talk
to the government about you
even when i m no longer your lawyer 
that would be breaking
my word  my oath 
all right  mitch 
so what was this
stealing of the files 
what the fuck was this all about 
the files haven t been stolen 
they re in exactly the
same place they were 
i just felt it was important for me
to be thoroughly familiar
with the precise make up
and whereabouts
of all your holdings and activities 
so i prepared copies of everything 
that way you and i
can communicate perfectly 
and  of course  if we ever
have to talk to a third party 
then i know everything 
right down to the penny  pound 
franc and deutsche mark 
i know everything you know 
as i should  as your attorney 
and what if the firm
should desire at some point
to terminate your employment 
whatever i know  wherever i go  i am
bound by the attorney client privilege 
i am very much like   
i would say i am exactly like
a ship carrying a cargo
that will never reach any port 
and as long as i am alive  that ship
will always be at sea  so to speak 
like yasir fucking arafat  huh 
never a night in the same place 
in any case  i need
your written authorization 
so i can release your bills 
like every other client has given 
you have this
authorization with you 
i do 
  anything in there 
  nothing 
fuck 
you got the account number 
you know how to access it 
mitch has verified
that the money s there 
 750 000 
i love your crooked little mouth 
well  it s not my best feature 
wow 
well  what is 
where the hell are you 
what is this supposed to be 
huh 
  you let the moroltos off the hook 
  they re my clients 
they re the crooks 
you re letting the mafia get away 
  what the hell are you doing 
  you guys are always one villain
behind the times  you know that 
you gave me a bunch of pencil
pushers who padded their bills 
you think if they don t pull guns 
they aren t the bad guys 
ask the moroltos who s
harder to find 
the killer or the lawyer
who hides their money 
don t give me that shit 
that s a bunch of double talk
and you know it 
you want the mafia 
get their lawyers 
without the firm  the only way
the moroltos can launder money
is in a washing machine 
you are so naive 
there ll be a thousand other
bendini lamberts
fighting for the chance
to launder money tomorrow 
how the hell you gonna
get all of them 
one at a time 
i m a lawyer and i got mine 
you re the cop  tarrance 
you get the rest of them 
get them with what 
overbilling  mail fraud 
that s exciting 
it s not sexy  but it s got teeth 
 10 000 and five years in prison 
that s 10 and five for each act 
have you really looked at that 
you ve got every partner
in the firm on overbilling 
there s 250 acts of
documented mail fraud there 
that s racketeering 
that s a minimum
of 1 250 years in prison
and two and a half
million dollars in fines 
that s more than you had on capone 
you twist this into whatever you want 
you made a deal to save your ass 
you got our money  three
quarters of a million dollars of it 
you re still a hot shot lawyer
and you re out of this 
i didn t keep a
nickel of your money 
it was always for somebody else 
and  yeah 
i m still a lawyer with references
from bendini  lambert   locke 
you want to put that
on your resume 
you think i m ever gonna
turn on the ignition in my car again
without sweating 
then i don t understand you 
what did you do it for 
you didn t win a thing 
oh  yeah  i did  i won my life back 
you don t run me and they don t run me  
you want to know something weird 
i discovered the law again 
you actually made me think about it 
i managed to get through three years
of law school without doing that 
it s you at the dog track 
i could ve gone public with it 
  why didn t you 
  it s against the law 
okay 
how in the hell did you ever
come up with mail fraud 
it was on the bar exam 
they made me study like hell for it 
well  you ve had a busy day 
so did you 
why didn t you tell me the
truth about your plan 
all of it 
the moroltos 
because i knew you d worry 
and that might make you stay 
and i knew you needed to leave 
i like what you ve
done to the place 
  i thought you were going to your folks  
  i was 
some detour 
where are you going 
to look for you 
i guess i didn t feel i could leave
you without trying to help you 
do you want to tell
me what happened 
someday 
i think you should know
that avery was pretty decent 
he was decent  and corrupt 
and ruined  and so unhappy   
listen  abby   
and it could have happened
to you  all of it 
you were on your way 
did i lose you 
you look tired 
did i 
i ve loved you all my life 
even before we met 
part of it wasn t even you 
it was just a promise of you 
but these last days 
you kept your promise 
how could you lose me 
  you think it will make it 
  make it where 
boston 
what s in boston 
we are
