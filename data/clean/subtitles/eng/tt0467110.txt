the wickedest man in the world 
he was evil and crazy 
simon and his wacky henchman  cad 
schemed to rule the universe 
but each time they were foiled by me 
the greatest superhero
who ever lived    underdog 
 man  ladies and gentlemen 
i come to you this evening
to discuss the growing problem
of crime in our city 
here in front of me
are files of unsolved cases 
 underdog  we re getting
ahead of ourselves 
that s me in the uniform 
i was raised  since i was just
a little puppy  to fight crime 
never had a family
or a place to call home 
i was raised with one purpose
and one purpose only 
to help people  to keep them safe 
nothing was going to stand in my way 
 barks 
   man stops speaking 
  easy  boy 
  however  to the families involved   
  you got something  boy 
   barking 
  what was that 
alpha dog has got a lock on the stage 
i think it s the boxes 
criminals should not be allowed
to keep their freedom 
   howling 
  clear the building 
 man  we need swat here  now 
please hurry  your honor 
 man 2  everybody out 
blue team  go  go  move 
 electronic beeping 
no radiation 
no metal 
tweezers  and we ll lift 
easy  right down the side 
yeah  slow  and slide 
i bet you didn t know
a beagle s sense of smell
is 55 times stronger than a human s 
 sneezes 
well  mine s not 
it s a gift from
the american pork association 
 laughter 
i want a full debrief  now 
 laughter continues 
 dogs barking 
 dogs laughing 
nice work  rookie 
you found an exploding ham 
quiet  i smell a bomb 
you  you should just
turn in your tags 
 dogs continue laughing 
all right  i ll be honest with you 
i wasn t the best dog on the force 
in fact  i was probably the worst 
the ham was just
the latest of my mistakes 
like the time i chewed the extension
cord and it was plugged in 
or when i met that cute poodle
and it turned out to be a guy 
it s hard to feel destined for greatness
when you keep messing up 
but  destiny s a funny thing 
it ll creep up on you
when you least expect it 
gotcha 
last one for tonight 
 dogs barking 
excuse me 
uh  there s been a big mistake 
i m not a stray 
i shouldn t be in the pound 
this ain t no pound  son 
this place makes the pound
look like the dog park 
by day it s ok  but at night 
once everyone s left 
that s when the freaky stuff happens 
what kind of  freaky stuff  
  what did they do to your hair 
  what s wrong with my hair 
 stammers  nothing  nothing at all 
you were saying about
the  freaky stuff   
all i m saying is when the guy
in the white lab coat
pulls out the giant needle  run 
 laughs maniacally 
 whistling 
hey 
welcome to the graveyard 
yeah  nice and quiet 
just like i like it 
uh  sir  excuse me 
we re not open right now 
there s no access to the labs 
oh  really  i m sorry 
that s all right  don t worry 
oh  wait  what s this 
what does this say 
uh     all access    sorry 
it s ok  you all make mistakes 
but i forgive you 
because that s the kind
of person i am    humble 
a humble genius 
 man  it s ok 
let him in 
please 
again  i m sorry  dr  barsinister 
  i m terribly sorry 
  it s ok  how were you to know
that i am the most important scientist
this company has 
you couldn t have 
 elevator bell dings 
   barsinister  who s the new hire 
  him  he  uh  used to be a cop 
i was thinking that maybe
we should take it easy
on the after hours stuff 
you know  clandestine 
a three syllable word  i m impressed 
i bought a  uh   
 mispronouncing     thesaurus 
good for you 
but even if he is an ex cop  we don t
have time to skulk about  look 
 police dog training   
it s a great idea 
why didn t you think of that 
because training is a fool s process 
i ve met with the mayor 
and i told him how we could
take this city to new heights
through genetic manipulation 
 meowing 
  yeah  what did he say 
  the fool actually laughed at me 
that happened to me once 
i had my pants on inside out 
nobody told me for the entire day 
  stop talking now 
  oh  right  right 
i ll be the silent partner 
just because you re the only one here 
cad  does not make us partners 
wow  a real life mad scientist 
yeah  and he ain t even mad yet 
all right  bring me the new dog 
your lucky day 
 barsinister  and now 
the most important dna 
   whimpers 
   barsinister  oh 
don t worry  little guy 
it will only hurt    a lot 
ok  let s do it  partner 
 sneezes 
gross  your mouth was open 
just hold him 
   barking 
   screaming 
 cad  hey  doc  get him

  the serum 
   cad  he s going for the door 
run  boy  run  run 
bring me a chew toy from the outside 
and maybe some hair gel 
 gasps  it works 
   screaming 
  doc 
 indistinct chatter on police radio 
i m pulling the security tapes
and running a computer sweep
  of dr  barsinister s research 
  dan  we ll handle it from here 
when there s a crime  they call a cop 
when someone wants to
sign into the building  they call you 
   laughter 
  right 
that s why you re the chief 
with a big filing cabinet
marked  unsolved crimes   
hey  guys   
yeah  that was some night 
i was homeless and hungry 
and just when i thought
it couldn t get any worse 
these numbskulls show up 
 male dog  hey  runt  you lost 
  the name s riff raff 
  he s riff raff 
  i ve marked this territory 
  yeah  he marked it 
look  i don t want any trouble  ok 
well  then today s your lucky day  mutt 
i d rip you to pieces 
but i don t want to get my paws dirty 
yeah  you re not
worth his time  fleabag 
   chuckles  fleabag  yes

sweet  we re going to get him 
come back here 
that mutt dumped my trash 
come on  get him  boys 
  he thinks he s a greyhound 
  look at him go 
 riff raff  i ll eat
that runt for dinner 
dibs on leftovers 
   tires screeching 
  oh  speed bump 
  what a way to go 
  i m with you  boss 
let s get out of here 
 dog whimpering 
hello

hey  i thought i clipped you 
what are you doing   laughing 
you re a funny little dog 
come here  come here 
let me see  where s your collar 
oh  is that a kiss 
where s your collar 
you don t have a home 
why don t you come home with me  huh 
we got a nice home  just for you 
   engine starts 
  what are you doing out that window 
i know what you re thinking 
he just hit me with his car 
and i climb in the front seat 
look  i may not be able
to smell a bomb 
but i can smell a good person 
   keyboard clicking 
   boy  please excuse jack unger
from any and all activity
because he has a bad cold 
no  too simplistic 
he has shingles 
no  i already used that 
come on  jack  dig deep 
 sighs  i got one 
perfect 
 dan  hey  jack 
you ready for school yet 
  yeah 
  come on out back 
  i can t  i m busy 
  aw  come on 
i got something to show you 
   groaning 
  hey  i heard that 
yeah  you re a good dog 
can you sit for me 
   sneezes 
  oh  god bless you 
here s your ba   
hey  jack  look 
  you bought a dog 
  no  i didn t buy him 
i  uh  i found him on the street 
he s cute  isn t he 
i thought maybe we d go for walks 
take him on a hike 
hikes  oh  fun 
hey  look at that  i think
we should call him    shoeshine 
considering all the other
things he probably licks 
i think that s the best call 
jack  i just thought
he would be good for you 
take your mind off a few things 
listen  i m telling you
i am fine  all right 
  ok 
  you don t have to keep doing this 
you ve got other things to worry about 
like being a prison guard to lab rats 
you know what 
i like the new job 
 phone ringing 
if you don t want the dog  i ll
take him to the pound this afternoon 
 door opens and closes 
  hello 
   groans 
no  no  i ll come back 
all right  thank you 
i got to go back to work 
  what about shoelick 
  shoeshine 
listen  do me a favor 
keep an eye on him 
you know what 
give him a chance 
  you might even like him 
  i don t think so 
all he does is eat  sleep and poop 
then the two of you
have a lot in common  don t you 
 barsinister  i can isolate specific
protein strands in animal dna 
then combine them any way i want 
this will give him
the speed of a cheetah 
the ability to fly like an eagle 
or the strength of an animal
one hundred times his weight 
forging a doctor s note  jack 
is this what it s come to 
i didn t forge it 
so  you expect me to believe
that you have     monkeypox  
 coughing  it s pretty bad 
ok 
i don t know what disappoints me more 
the fact that you did it 
or that you did so poorly that
you couldn t even fool a p e  teacher 
ahhh  food 
 sniffing 
yep  definitely smell food 
hmm 
it s not dog food  but it s about to be 
oh  no 
they re going to blame this on me

   growls 
 rats squeaking 
 barsinister  yes  yes  brilliant 
already the flames of inspiration
are licking at my brain 
unencumbered 
in this  my new laboratory 
  kind of smells like a men s room 
  so much the better 
it seems like the wrong vibe
for our work 
seems a little precocious 
  perspicacious 
  what 
peppery  prim 
most of my thesaurus
burned up in the fire 
all i ve got left are the p s 
  perfect 
  ooh  that s a good one 
can i use that 
the material i require
is going to be expensive 
we re going to need to find ways
to subsidize my work 
i know some guys who just
got out of the clink who can help us 
perhaps  bam 
  ahhh 
  nailed it 
jack and i became good buddies 
for the first time in my life 
i really felt like man s best friend 
 man  hot dogs  nice and hot 
come on 
bite into a nice juicy hot dog 
what  what 
oh  my gosh  they re made of dog 
are you people crazy 
shoeshine  come here 
it s not real dog 
  what is it then 
  it s just animal parts 
you know  like noses 
hooves  intestines 
well  in that case  i ll take two 
hot dogs  hot dogs 
that s what i got 
hot dogs  hot dogs 
nice and hot 
  why is he talking like that 
  he s rhyming 
it s a gimmick 
to get people s attention 
that seems like a strange convention
for you to mention 
and this is where i m bored
out of my mind  eight hours a day 
whenever i m bored
i just chase my tail 
if you re lucky
you throw up and bingo 
lunch  part two 
  nice 
  what 
sticks  balls  and running in one game 
  so clever  so inspired 
  not our team 
we re always the underdogs 
never heard of that breed 
is that a dog from australia 
no  look 
an underdog is someone
who has been counted out
and nobody expects them to win 
  yeah  i know the feeling  huh 
   cat meows 
 shoeshine  there goes the neighborhood 
  shoeshine  no 
   groans 
  freak

from a guy who pees
in my white porcelain drinking bowi 
all right  basic commands 
chapter one  sit 
let s start with a tough one 
  chapter two  lie down 
  fine 
i was going to do that anyway 
chapter three  roll over 
this book doesn t have
much of a plot  does it 
and chapter four  speak 
arf  arf 
you can t be serious with this 
four weeks of lessons
in four seconds 
we re on a good pace 
chapter five 
return the book and get your money back 
  i got you something 
  oh  never had one of these before 
if you ever get lost
they ll know where to bring you home 
 home   
wow  this is great 
oh  ew  oh  that breath is horrible 
what have you been eating 
not sure  i dug it out
from under the house 
suddenly i had a home and a family 
i had all that i ever wanted 
the only thing that could mess this up
was if a mad scientist bent on revenge
was living underneath the city 
well  guess what 
oh  the price i ve paid 
 sighs  so be it 
hi  how s it going 
i d love to  baby  but i m busy 
work out  yeah  i work out

   toy squeaking 
   newscast plays on tv 
rubber  what kind of sick joke is this 
   this demonstration will
convince international leaders
that the capitol city k 9 academy
is the future for k 9 crime fighters 
maybe i should sign you up 
i don t think that s a good idea 
my dad used to be on the force 
he was twice decorated
by the mayor for bravery 
  he was a real hero 
  what happened 
he quit 
  that a big deal 
  a big deal 
yeah 
ok  he says he quit his job
to spend time with me after my mom died 
and he s still never home 
we re interrupting with breaking news 
one of our camera crews following police
have stumbled upon
a jewelry store robbery 
the thieves have taken several hostages 
you never see dogs
hurting each other for money 
you never see
people sniffing each other s butts 
mmm  touché 
as you can see  it is a tense situation 
hey  you can stop it 
like with molly and polly 
no  no  no way  uh uh

well  maybe this is why you re here 
look  i was just getting
the hang of the whole  pet  thing

the truth is 
i just want to be a regular dog 
and i want to be a regular kid
with a mom and a dad 
but you know what 
life doesn t always work out that way 
 sighing  all right

 male reporter  while most
of our city remains skeptical 
the post is standing by its story
of a dog thwarting
yesterday s jewelry robbery 
according to eyewitnesses  the animal
displayed uncommon strength   
i knew it 
the police have yet to comment
on this strange report 
  the mayor s office has only said   
  my creation 
they mention me 
anything about a thief
with amazing hair 
if the reports
of the superdog are true   
you re a superhero 
you re a hairy  four legged superhero 
you know what 
you re like superman with a flea collar 
no  no  no  i m not 
you saved those people 
i know  and it felt good 
but i can t do this  someone s gonna
