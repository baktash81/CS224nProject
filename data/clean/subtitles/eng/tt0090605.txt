hypersleep

please 
fifty seven years 
what 
you were out there
for fifty seven years 
you drifted
right through the core systems 
it s really just blind luck   
that a deep salvage team
found you

it s over 
hi  sorry i m late 
been running behind all morning 
is there
any word about my daughter 
uh   l think we should
worry about the hearing now 
we don t have a lot of time 
i read your deposition 
and it s great 
if you stick to that 
we ll be fine 
the thing is  there are gonna be
a lot of heavyweights in there 
feds  interstellar
commerce commission   
colonial administration 
insurance company guys 
do you have any news
about my daughter 
we did come up
with some information 
why don t we sit down 
i was hoping to wait
until after the inquest 
uh   
 amanda ripley mcclaren  
married name  i guess 
 age sixty six  
that was at the time
of her death   
which was two years ago 
i m real sorry 
amy 
she was cremated and interred   
at westlake repository 
little chute  wisconsin 
no children  i checked 
i promised her   
that i would be home
for her birthday 
her eleventh birthday 
ohh   
i d like to
go back to this point   
about the override
destruct elements 
i don t understand this 
we have been here
three and a half hours 
how many different ways
do you want the same story 
look at it
from our perspective  please 
please 
you freely admit to
detonating the engines of   
and thereby destroying
an m class star freighter   
a rather expensive piece
of hardware 
forty two million
in adjusted dollars 
that s minus payload  of course 
the lifeboat s
flight recorder   
corroborates some elements
of your account   
in that  for reasons unknown   
the nostromo
set down on lv 426   
an unsurveyed planet
at that time   
that it resumed its course   
and was subsequently set
for self destruct by you   
for reasons unknown 
not for reasons unknown 
i told you 
we set down on company orders
to get this thing   
which destroyed my crew
and your expensive ship 
the analysis team   
which went over the lifeboat
centimeter by centimeter   
found no physical evidence
of the creature you describe 
good  that s because i blew it
out of the goddamn air lock 
like i said 
are there any species   
like this hostile organism
on lv 426 
no  it s a rock 
no indigenous life 
did iqs just drop sharply
while i was away 
ma am  i already said
it was not indigenous 
it was a derelict spacecraft 
it was an alien ship 
it was not from there 
do you get it 
we homed in on its beacon 
and found something
never recorded once   
in over three hundred
surveyed worlds 
 a creature that gestates
inside a living human host  
these are your words 
 and has concentrated acid
for blood  
that s right 
look 
i can see where this is going   
but i m telling you
that those things exist 
thank you  officer ripley 
that will be all 
please  you re not listening 
kane the crew member   
kane  who went into that ship 
said he saw thousands of eggs 
thank you  that will be all 
god damn it  that s not all 
if one of those things gets
down here  that will be all 
and all this bullshit
you think is important   
you can kiss all that good bye 
it is the finding
of this court of inquiry   
that warrant officer
e  ripley   
n o c one four four seven two   
has acted
with questionable judgment   
and is unfit
to hold an icc license   
as a commercial flight officer 
said license is hereby
suspended indefinitely 
no criminal charges   
will be filed against you
at this time   
and you are released
on your own recognizance   
for a six month period
of psychometric probation   
to include monthly review by
an icc psychiatric technician 
these proceedings are closed 
that could have been better 
look  i think ripley 
van leuwen 
why don t you just
check out lv 426 
because i don t have to 
people have been there
for over twenty years   
and they never complained
about any hostile organism 
what people 
terraformers 
planet engineers 
they go in 
set up atmosphere processors   
to make the air breathable 
it takes decades 
it s what we call
a shake  n  bake colony 
how many are there 
how many colonists 
i don t know 
sixty  maybe seventy families 
do you mind 
families 
jesus 
i ll be down in maintenance 
 al 
 what 
 hey  al 
 what 
remember you sent
some wildcatters   
out in the middle of nowhere
last week   
out past the ilium range 
one s on the horn 
a mom and pop survey team 
he s onto something 
wants his claim honored 
why wouldn t it be honored 
because you sent them
on company orders maybe 
christ  some haunch in
a cushy office on earth says   
 go look at a grid reference  
we look  they don t say why 
and i don t ask   
because it takes two weeks
to get an answer out here 
the answer is always 
 don t ask  
what do i tell this guy 
as far as i m concerned 
if he finds something  it s his 
 lydecker 
 what 
you kids know
you re not supposed to be here 
get out 
you go in places we can t fit 
so  that s why i m the best 
knock it off 
if i catch you playing in the
air ducts  i ll tan your hides 
mom  all the kids play 
wait 
have a look at this 
folks 
we have scored big this time 
what is it  dad 
i m not sure 
let s see if we can t get
a closer look at this thing   
maybe through that crack
on the side 
shouldn t we call in 
let s wait till we know
what to call it in as 
that s about as close
as we can get 
should we look inside 
you kids stay inside 
i mean it 
we ll be right back 
ok 
bye 
huh 
timmy 
they ve been gone a long time 
it ll be ok 
dad knows what he s doing 
mayday  mayday 
this is alpha kilo two four 
niner calling control 
this is
alpha kilo two four niner 
aah

hiya  ripley 
this is lieutenant gorman
of the colonial marine corps 
ripley  we have to talk 
we ve lost contact
with the colony on lv 426 
i don t believe this 
you guys throw me
to the wolves   
and now you want me
to go back there 
forget it 
it s not my problem 
 can i finish 
 no 
there s no way 
you wouldn t be
going in with the troops 
i can guarantee your safety 
these colonial marines
are very tough hombres 
they re packing
state of the art firepower 
there s nothing
they can t handle 
lieutenant  am i right 
we ve been trained to deal
with situations like this 
then you don t need me 
i m not a soldier 
but we don t know
exactly what s going on 
it may be a downed transmitter 
but if it s not   
i d like you there
as an advisor  and that s all 
what s your interest
in all this  why are you going 
the corporation co financed
that colony   
along with
colonial administration 
we re getting into a lot
of terraforming now   
and building better worlds 
yeah  i saw the commercial 
i don t have time for this 
i ve got to get to work

working the cargo docks 
that s right 
running loaders and forklifts 
yeah  so 
nothing  i think it s great
that you re keeping busy 
i know it s the only thing
you could get 
there s nothing wrong with it 
what would you say
if i told you   
i could get you reinstated
as a flight officer 
the company s already agreed
to pick up your contract 
if i go 
yeah  if you go 
come on 
that s a second chance  kiddo 
i think personally for you   
it would be the best thing
to go and face this thing 
get back on the horse 
spare me 
i ve had my psych evaluation 
i know  i ve read it 
you wake up every night 
soaked in sweat 
i said no  and i mean it

i thought you
never missed  bishop 
you never said anything about
an android being on board 
it never occurred to me 
it s common practice
to have a synthetic on board 
i prefer the term
 artificial person  
right 
is there a problem 
i m sorry  i don t know
why i didn t even   
ripley s last trip  the syn 
the artificial person
malfunctioned 
malfunctioned 
there were problems 
and a few deaths were involved 
i m shocked 
was it an older model 
yeah 
the hyperdyne systems 120 a 2 
that explains it  the a 2s
always were a bit twitchy 
that could never happen now
with our behavioral inhibitors 
it is impossible for me
to harm   
or allow to be harmed
a human being 
sure you don t want some 
just stay away from me 
you got that straight 
guess she don t like
the cornbread  either
