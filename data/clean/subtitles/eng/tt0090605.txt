its over
hi sorry im late
been running behind all morning
is there
any word about my daughter
uhl think we should
worry about the hearing now
we dont have a lot of time
i read your deposition
and its great
if you stick to that
well be fine
the thing is there are gonna be
a lot of heavyweights in there
feds interstellar
commerce commission
colonial administration
insurance company guys
do you have any news
about my daughter
we did come up
with some information
why dont we sit down
i was hoping to wait
until after the inquest
uh
amanda ripley mcclaren
married name i guess
age sixtysix
that was at the time
of her death
which was two years ago
im real sorry
amy
she was cremated and interred
at westlake repository
little chute wisconsin
no children i checked
i promised her
that i would be home
for her birthday
her eleventh birthday
ohh
id like to
go back to this point
about the override
destruct elements
i dont understand this
we have been here
three and a half hours
how many different ways
do you want the same story
look at it
from our perspective please
please
you freely admit to
detonating the engines of
and thereby destroying
an mclass star freighter
a rather expensive piece
of hardware
fortytwo million
in adjusted dollars
thats minus payload of course
the lifeboats
flight recorder
corroborates some elements
of your account
in that for reasons unknown
the nostromo
set down on lv426
an unsurveyed planet
at that time
that it resumed its course
and was subsequently set
for selfdestruct by you
for reasons unknown
not for reasons unknown
i told you
we set down on company orders
to get this thing
which destroyed my crew
and your expensive ship
the analysis team
which went over the lifeboat
centimeter by centimeter
found no physical evidence
of the creature you describe
good thats because i blew it
out of the goddamn air lock
like i said
are there any species
like this hostile organism
on lv426
no its a rock
no indigenous life
did iqs just drop sharply
while i was away
maam i already said
it was not indigenous
it was a derelict spacecraft
it was an alien ship
it was not from there
do you get it
we homed in on its beacon
and found something
never recorded once
in over three hundred
surveyed worlds
a creature that gestates
inside a living human host
these are your words
and has concentrated acid
for blood
thats right
look
i can see where this is going
but im telling you
that those things exist
thank you officer ripley
that will be all
please youre not listening
kanethe crew member
kane who went into that ship
said he saw thousands of eggs
thank you that will be all
god damn it thats not all
if one of those things gets
down here that will be all
and all this bullshit
you think is important
you can kiss all that goodbye
it is the finding
of this court of inquiry
that warrant officer
e ripley
noconefourfourseventwo
has acted
with questionable judgment
and is unfit
to hold an icc license
as a commercial flight officer
said license is hereby
suspended indefinitely
no criminal charges
will be filed against you
at this time
and you are released
on your own recognizance
for a sixmonth period
of psychometric probation
to include monthly review by
an icc psychiatric technician
these proceedings are closed
that could have been better
look i thinkripley
van leuwen
why dont you just
check out lv426
because i dont have to
people have been there
for over twenty years
and they never complained
about any hostile organism
what people
terraformers
planet engineers
they go in
set up atmosphere processors
to make the air breathable
it takes decades
its what we call
a shake n bake colony
how many are there
how many colonists
i dont know
sixty maybe seventy families
do you mind
families
jesus
ill be down in maintenance
al
what
hey al
what
remember you sent
some wildcatters
out in the middle of nowhere
last week
out past the ilium range
ones on the horn
a momandpop survey team
hes onto something
wants his claim honored
why wouldnt it be honored
because you sent them
on company orders maybe
christ some haunch in
a cushy office on earth says
go look at a grid reference
we look they dont say why
and i dont ask
because it takes two weeks
to get an answer out here
the answer is always
dont ask
what do i tell this guy
as far as im concerned
if he finds something its his
lydecker
what
you kids know
youre not supposed to be here
get out
you go in places we cant fit
so thats why im the best
knock it off
if i catch you playing in the
air ducts ill tan your hides
mom all the kids play
wait
have a look at this
folks
we have scored big this time
what is it dad
im not sure
lets see if we cant get
a closer look at this thing
maybe through that crack
on the side
shouldnt we call in
lets wait till we know
what to call it in as
thats about as close
as we can get
should we look inside
you kids stay inside
i mean it
well be right back
ok
bye
huh
timmy
theyve been gone a long time
itll be ok
dad knows what hes doing
mayday mayday
this is alpha kilo twofour

to the wolves
and now you want me
to go back there

thats right
running loaders and forklifts
yeah so
nothing i think its great
that youre keeping busy
i know its the only thing
you could get
theres nothing wrong with it
what would you say
if i told you
i could get you reinstated
as a flight officer
the companys already agreed
to pick up your contract
if i go
yeah if you go
come on
thats a second chance kiddo
i think personally for you
it would be the best thing
to go and face this thing
get back on the horse
spare me
ive had my psych evaluation
i know ive read it
you wake up every night
soaked in sweat
i said no and i mean it
now please leave
i am not going back
