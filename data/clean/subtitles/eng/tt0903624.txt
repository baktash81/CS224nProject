you asked me once if i had told you
everything there was to know about my
adventures
and while i can honestly say
i have told you the truth
i may not have told you all of it
i am old now frodo
im not the same hobbit i once was
i think it is time for you to know
what really happened
it began long ago
in a land far away to the east
the like of which you will
not find in the world today
there was the city of dale
its markets known far and wide
full of the bounties of fine and vail
peaceful and prosperous
for this city laid before the doors
of the greatest kingdom in middle earth
erebor
stronghold of thrór
king under the mountain
the mightiest of the dwarf lords
thrór ruled with utter surety
never doubting his house would endure
for his line lay secure
in the lives of his son
and grandson
ah frodo erebor
built deep within the mountain itself
the beauty of this fortress
city was a legend
its wealth lay in the earth
in precious gems humed from rock
and in great seams of gold
running like rivers through stone
the skill of the dwarves was unequaled
fashioning object of great beauty
out of diamond emerald
ruby and sapphire
ever they delved deeper
down into the dark
and that is where they found it
the heart of the mountain
the arkenstone
thrór named it the kings jewel
he took it as a sign a sign
that his right to rule was divine
all would pay homage to him
even the great elven king thranduil
but the years of peace and
plenty were not to last
slowly the days turned sour
and the watchful nights closed in
thrórs love of gold
had grown too fierce
a sickness had begun to grow within him
it was a sickness of the mind
and where sickness thrives
bad things will follow
the first they heard was a noise like
a hurricane coming down from the north
the pines on the mountain creaked
and cracked in the hot dry wind
thorin balin sound the alarm
call out the guards do it now
balin what is it
dragon
dragon
old bilbo vo he was a firedrake from the north
smaug had come
such wanton death was dealt that day
for this city of men was nothing to smaug
his eye was set on another price
for dragons covet gold
with a dark and fierce desire
no
erebor was lost
for a dragon will guard his plunder
as long as he lives
run for your lives
help us
thranduil would not risk the lives of
his kin against the lawth of the dragon
no help came from the elves that day
nor any day since
robbed of their homeland the dwarves
of erebor wandered the wilderness
the once mighty people brought low
the young dwarf prince took
work where he could find it
laboring in the villages of men
but always he remembered
the mountain smoke beneath the moon
the trees like torches blazing bright
where he had seen dragon fire in the sky
and a city turn to ash
and he never forgave
and he never forgot
that my dear frodo is where i come in
for quite by chance
and the will of a wizard
fate decided i would
become part of this tale
it began
well it began as you might expect
in a hole in the ground
there lived a hobbit
not a nasty dirty wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells
this was a hobbit home
and that means good
food a warm house
and all the comforts of home
old bilbo thank you
frodo whats this
that is private
keep your sticky paws off
its not ready yet
not ready for what
reading
old bilbo what on earth are these
frodo replies to the party invitations
good gracious
is it today
they all say theyre coming
except for the sackville bagginses
whore demanding you ask them in person
old bilbo are they indeed
over my dead body
theyd probably find that quite agreeable
they seem to think you have tunnels
overflowing with gold
it was one small chest
hardly overflowing
and it still smells of troll
what on earth are you doing
taking precautions
you know i caught her making off
with the silverware once
frodo who
old bilbo lobelia sackville baggins
she had all my spoons
stuffed in her pockets
dreadful woman
make sure you keep an eye
on her after im
when im when
when youre what
its nothing nothing
frodo you know some people are
beginning to wonder about you
they think youre becoming odd
odd
hmm
unsociable
unsociable me
nonsense
be a good lad and put that on the gate
do you think he will come
who
gandalf
oh he wouldnt miss a chance
to let off his wiz poppers
hell give us quite a show youll see
frodo right then i am off
frodo right then i am off
off to where
frodo eastfarthing woods
im going to surprise him
old bilbo well go on then
you dont want to be late
old bilbo he doesnt approve being late
not that i ever was
in those days i was always on time
i was entirely respectable
and nothing unexpected
ever happened
an unexpected journey
good morning
what do you mean
do you mean to wish me a good morning
or do you mean that it is a good
morning whether i want it or not
or perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular morning
or are you simply stating that
this is a morning to be good on
all of them at once i suppose
can i help you
it remains to be seen
im looking for someone
to share in an adventure
an adventure
no i dont imagine
anyone west of bree
whod have much interest in adventures
nasty disturbing
uncomfortable things
make you late for dinner
good morning
to think that i should have lived to be
good morninged by belladonna tooks son
as if i was selling buttons at the door
beg your pardon
youve changed and not entirely
for the better bilbo baggins
im sorry do i know you
would you know my name although
you dont remember i belong to it

them on midsummers eve
i had no idea you were still in business
and where else should i be

you remember something about me

bebother and confusticate these dwarves
gandalf my dear bilbo
what on earth is the matter
whats the matter
i am surrounded by dwarves
what theyre doing here
oh theyre quite a merry gathering
once you get used to em
i dont want to get used to them
look at the state of my kitchen
theres mud trodding the carpet
they  theyve pillaged the pantry
im not even gonna tell you
what theyve done in the bathroom
theyve all but destroyed the plumbing
i dont understand what
theyre doing in my house
ori excuse me im sorry to interrupt
but what shad do with my plate
fili here you go ori give it to me
excuse me
thats my mothers westfarthing pottery
its over a hundred years old
doing music with kitchenware
bilbo and  and ca  can you not do that
youll blunt them
ooh dyou hear that lads
he says well blunt the knives
blunt the knives bend the forks
smash the bottles and burn the corks
chip the glasses and crack the plates
thats what bilbo baggins hates
cut the cloth and tread on the fat
leave the bones on the bedroommat
pour the milk on the pantryfloor
splash the wine on every door
dump the crocks in a boiling bowl
pound them up with a thumping pole
when youve finished
if any are whole
send them down the hall to roll
thats what bilbo baggins hates
all dwarves laughing loud
somebody hits the door hard
hes here
gandalf
i thought you said this place
would be easy to find
i lost my way twice
i wouldnt have found it at all
had it not been for that mark on the door
bilbo mark theres no mark on that door
it was painted a week ago
gandalf there is a mark
i have put it there myself
bilbo baggins allow me to introduce
the leader of our company
thorin oakenshield
so
this is the hobbit
tell me mr baggins
have you done much fighting
pardon me
axe or sword whats
your weapon of choice
well i do have some skill at conkers
if you must know
but i fail to see why thats relevant
i thought as much
he looks more like a grocer
than a burglar
laughs
balin what news from the meeting in ered luin
did they all come
did they all come
aye
envoys from all seven kingdoms
dwalin and what did the dwarves
of the iron hill say
is dain with us
they will not come
thorin they say this quest is ours
and ours alone
bilbo youre doing a quest
gandalf bilbo my dear fellow
let us have a little more light
far to the east
over ranges and rivers
beyond woodlands and wastelands
lies a single solitary peak
bilbo the lonely mountain
gloin aye óin has read the portents
and the portents say it is time
oin ravens have been seen flying back
to the mountain as it was foretold
when the birds of the old return to erebor
the reign of the beast will end
bilbo uh
what beast
bofur well that would be a reference
to smaug the terrible
chiefest and greatest
calamity of our age
airborne fire breather
teeth like razors claws like meat hooks
extremely fond of precious metals
extremely fond of precious metals
yes i know what a dragon is
im not afraid im up for it
ill give him a taste of the dwarfish
iron right up his jacksy
cheers
dori sit down
balin the task would be difficult enough
with an army behind us
but we number just thirteen
and not thirteen of the best
nor brightest
ori hey who youre calling dimp
fili we may be few in number
but were fighters
all of us
to the last one
kili and you forget we have
a wizard in our company
gandalf will have killed
hundreds of dragons in his time
oh well no uh i
i wouldnt say
dori how many then
how many then
what
well how many dragons have you killed
dori go on give us a number
uh give me  please please
thorin enough
if we have read these signs do you not
think others will have read them too
rumors have begun to spread
the dragon smaug has not
been seen for 60 years
eyes look east to the mountain
assessing wondering
weighing the risk
perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected do we sit back
while others claim
what is rightfully ours
or do we seize this chance
to take back erebor
thorin speaks darwish
balin you forget the front gate is sealed
there is no way into the mountain
gandlaf that my dear balin
is not totally true
thorin how came you by this
gandalf it was given to me by your father
by thráin for safekeeping
it is yours now
kili if there is a key there must be a door
these runes speak of a hidden
passage to the lower halls
theres another way in
well if we can find it but dwarf
doors are invisible when closed
the answer lies hidden
somewhere in this map
and i do not have the skill
to find it but
there are others in middle earth who can
the task i have in mind will require
a great deal of stealth
and no small amount of courage
but if were careful and clever
i believe that it can be done
ori thats why we need a burglar
bilbo hmm and a good one too
an expert i would imagine
gloin and are you
bilbo am i what
oin he said hes an expert
me no no no no no
i  im not a burglar
ive never stolen a thing in my life
and im afraid i have
to agree with mr baggins
hes hardly burglar material
aye the wild is no place for gentle folk who
can neither fight nor fend for themselves
all dwarves speak heatedly
enough if i say bilbo baggins is
a burglar then a burglar he is
hobbits are remarkably
light on their feet
in fact they can pass unseen
by most if they choose
and while the dragon is accustomed
to the smell of a dwarf
the scent of a hobbit is all
about unknown to him
which gives us a distinct advantage
you asked me to find the
14th member of this company
and i have chosen mr baggins
theres a lot more into him
than his appearances suggest
and hes got a great deal more
to offer than any of you know
including himself
you must trust me on this
very well
well do it your way
well do it your way
blibo no no
give him your contract
bofur were in
bilbo please
bofur were off
its just the usual summary
about the pocket expenses
time required remuneration
funeral arrangements so forth
funeral arrangements
ooh
we cannot guarantee his safety
understood
we will not be responsible for his fate
agreed
totals cash on delivery
up to but not exceeding
one fourteenth of total
profit if any seems fair
the present company shall not be liable
for injuries inflicted by or sustained
as a consequence thereof
including but not limited to
lacerations
evisceration
incineration
oh aye hell melt the flesh off
your bones in the blink of an eye
hu
you alright laddie
you alright laddie
huh yeah i fe
blows
feel a bit faint
think furnace with wings
think furnace with wings
hey i i i need air
bofur flash of light searing pain and puf
youre nothing more than a pile of ash
no
oh very helpful bofur
ill be alright just let me
sit quietly for a moment
youve been sitting quietly
for far too long
gandalf tell me
when did doilies and your mothers
dishes become so important to you
i remember a young hobbit who was always
running off in search of elves in woods
he would stay out late
come home after dark trailing
mud and twigs and fireflies
a young hobbit who wouldve liked
nothing better than to find out
what was beyond the borders of the shire
the world is not in your books and maps
its out there
i cant just go running off into the blue
i am a baggins of bagg end
you are also a took
did you know that your great great
great great uncle bullroarer took
was so large he could ride a real horse
yes well he could
in the battle of greenfields
he charged the goblin ranks
he swung his club so hard it knocked
the goblin kings head clean off
and it sailed a hundred yards through
the air and went down a rabbit hole
and thus the battle as won
and the game of golf
invented at the same times
bilbo i do believe you made that up
gandalf well all good stories
deserve embellishment
youll have a tale or two to tell
of your own when you come back
can you promise that i will come back
no
and if you do
youll not be the same
thats what i thought
sorry gandalf i cant sign this
youve got the wrong hobbit
balin it appears we have lost our burglar
probably for the best
the odds were always against us
after all what are we
merchants minors
tinkers toy makers
hardly the stuff of legend
there are a few warriors amongst us
old warriors
thorin i would take each and every one of these
dwarves over an army from the iron hills
for when i called upon them
they answered
loyalty
honor
a willing heart
i can ask no more than that
you dont have to do this
you have a choice
youve done honorably by our people
yоu hаvе buіlt а nеw lіfе
fоr uѕ іn thе βluе μоuntаіnѕ
a life of peace and plenty
a life that is worth more
than all the gold in erebor
from my grandfather to my father
this has come to me
they dreamt of the day when the dwarves
of erebor would reclaim their homeland
there is no choice balin
not for me
balin then we are with you laddie
we will see it done
far over the misty mountains cold
to dungeons deep and caverns old
we must away ere break of day
to find our long forgotten gold
the pines were roaring on the height
the winds were moaning in the night
the fire was red it flaming spread
the trees like torches
blazed with light
hello
passerby hey mr bilbo wherere you after
bilbo i cant stop im already late
late for what
im going on an adventure
bilbo wait
wait
i signed it
balin everything appears to be in order
welcome master baggins
in the company of thorin oakenshield
thorin give him a pony
no no no no that
that wont be necessary
i can  i am sure i can keep up on foot
yeah i  ive done my fair share of
walking holidays you know
even got as far as the frog mountain once
oin come on nori pay up
a dwarf one more
bilbo whats that about
gandalf oh they took wagers
on whether or not you would turn up
most of them bet that you wouldnt
and what did you think
my dear fellow
i never doubted of you for a second
oh its horsehair
having a reaction
uh
wait wait stop
bilbo stop we have to turn around
gandalf what on earth is the matter
i forgot my handkerchief
bofur here
use this
dwalin move on
gandalf youll have to manage
without pocket handkerchiefs
and a good many other
things bilbo baggins
before we reach our journeys end
you were born to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the shire
but home is now behind you
the world is ahead
dwarves snore
all snore heavily
bilbo good girl
heres a good girl
its our little secret myrtle
just tell no one shh shh
screams
what was that
orcs
orcs
fili throat cutters
thered be dozens of them out there
the low lands are crawling with them
kili they strike in the wee small hours
when everyones asleep
quick and quiet no screams
just lots of blood
thorin you think thats funny
you think a night raid by orcs is a joke
we didnt mean anything by it
thorin no you didnt
you know nothing of the world
balin dont mind him laddie
thorin has more cause
than most to hate orcs
balin cont after the dragon
took the lonely mountain
king thrór tried to reclaim
the ancient dwarf kingdom of moria
balin contd but our enemy
had got there first
moria had been taken by legions of orcs
led by the most vile of all their race
azog the defiler
the giant gundabad orc had sworn
to wipe out the line of durin
he began
by beheading the king
azog screams
noooooo
balin contd thráin thorins father
was driven mad by grief
he went missing taken prisoner
or killed we did not know
we were leaderless
defeat
and death
were upon us
that is when i saw him
a young dwarf prince
facing down the pale orc
he stood alone against this terrible foe
his armor rent wielding nothing
but an oaken branch as a shield
azog the defiler learned that day
that the line of durin
would not be so easily broken
thorin shouting in dwarvish
our forces rallied and
drove the orcs back
our enemy had been defeated
but there was no feast
nor song that night
for our dead were beyond
the count of grief
we few had survived
and i thought to myself then
there is one who i could follow
there is one
i could call king
bilbo and the pale orc
what happened to him
thorin he slunk back into the hall
whence he came
that filth died of his wounds long ago
wargs growl
dori there mr gandalf
cant you do something about this deluge
it is raining master dwarf
and it will continue to rain
until the rain is done
if you wish to change
the weather of the world
you should find yourself another wizard
are there any
are there any
what
other wizards
other wizards
there are five others
the greatest of our order
is saruman the white
then there are the two blue wizards
dyou know i have quite
forgotten their names
and who is the fifth
well that would be radagast the brown
is he a great wizard or is he
more like you
i think hes a very great wizard
in his own way
hes a gentle soul who prefers
the company of animals to others
he keeps a watchful eye over
the vast forestlands to the east
and a good thing too for always evil will
look to find a foothold in this world
forest birds singing
not good
not good at all
hmm
radagast whistles
oh oh no
sebastian
good gracious
move back give him some air
for goodness sake
i dont understand why its not working
its not as if its witchcraft
witchcraft
oh
but it is
a dark and powerful
magic
noises against the windows
hits against the door
sebastian exhales
mice squeaking
incantations in wizard language
incantations contd
noises stop
where on this good earth
do those foul creatures come from
bird sings
the old fortress
the bird sings
show me
thorin well camp here for the night

gandalf a farmer and his family
used to live here
thorin óin glóin
thorin óin glóin
aye
get the fire going
gandalf i think it would be wiser to move on
we could make for the hidden valley
thorin but ive told you already
i will not go near that place
gandalf why not
the elves could help us
we could get food rest advice
thorin i do not need their advice
gandalf we have a map that we cannot read
lord elrond could help us
thorin help
a dragon attacks erebor
what help came from the elves
orcs plunder moria
desecrate our sacred halls
the elves looked on and did nothing
you ask me to seek out the very people
who betrayed my grand father
who betrayed my father
you are neither of them
i did not give you that map and key
for you to hold on to the past
i did not know they were yours to keep
everything alright
gandalf where are you going
to seek the company of the only one
around here whos got any sense

gandalf to look ahead
thorin what brought you back
gandalf looking behind
nasty business
still they all are in one piece
no thanks to your burglar
he had the nose to play for time
none of the rest of you thought of that
gandalf they must have come down
from the ettenmoors
thorin since when the mountain trolls
venture this far south
gandalf oh not for an age
not since a darker power
ruled these lands
they could not have moved in daylight
thorin there must be a cave nearby
ofur oh whats that stench
gandalf its a troll hoard
be careful what you touch
all dwarves cough from the smell
bofur seems a shame just to
leave it lying around
anyone could take it
gloin agreed
nori come here
get a shovel
thorin these swords were not made by any troll
gandalf nor were they made
by any smith among men
these were forged in gondolin
by the high elves of the first age
you could not wish for a finer blade
gloin kíli come come
nori alright come
gloin were making a longterm deposit
thorin lets get out of this foul place
come on lets go
bofur glóin nori
gandalf bilbo
hm
here this is about your size
i cant take this
the blade is of elvish make which means
it will glow blue when
orcs or goblins are nearby
i  i have never used a sword in my life
and i hope youll never have to
but if you do remember this
true courage is about knowing not when
to take a life
but when to spare one
dwalin somethings coming
bilbo gandalf
gandalf stay together
hurry theyre armed
arm yourselves
radagast thieves fire murder
gandalf radagast
its radagast the brown
gandalf what on earth are you doing here
i was looking for you gandalf
somethings wrong
somethings terribly wrong
yes
radagast just give me a minute hm
no
i had a thought and
now ive lost it it was
it was was right there
on the tip of my tongue
oh its not a thought at all
its just only a
stick insect
radagast the greenwood is sick gandalf
a darkness has fallen over it
nothing glows anymore
at least nothing good
the air is foul of decay
but worse are the webs
gandalf webs what do you mean
radagast spiders gandalf
giant ones
some kind of spawn of ungoliant
or im not a wizard
i followed their trail
they came from dol guldur
gandalf dol guldur
but the old fortress is abandoned
no gandalf
it is not
radagast contd
a dark power dwells in there
such as i have never felt before
it is the shadow of an ancient aura
one that can summon
the spirits of the dead
i saw him gandalf
from out of the darkness
the necromancer has come
sorry
gandalf try a little old toby
itll help setting your nerves
then out
now the necromancer
are you sure
radagast that is not from the world
of the living
howlings
was that a wolf are there
are there wolves out there
wolves
no that is not a wolf
growls
thorin warg scouts
which means an orc pack is not far behind
orc pack
who did you tell about
your quest beyond your kin
no one
who did you tell
no one i swear
what in dorins name is going on
youre being hunted
dwalin we have to get out of here
ori we cant we have no ponies
they bolted
radagast ill draw them off
gandalf these are gundabad wargs
they will outrun you
these are rhosgobel rabbits
id like to see them try
wargs howl

radagast laughing
wargs bark
gandalf come on

thorin wherere you leading us
gandalf move

gloin there they are
gandalf this way

kili i think theres more coming
thorin kíli shoot them

fili wheres gandalf
dwalin hes abandoned us
thorin hold your ground
gandalf this way you fools
thorin comon move
quickly all of you
thorin go go go
gandalf  nine ten
kíli
run
hunting horn
noise of arrows
elves
dwalin i cannot see where the pathway leads
do we follow it or no
bofur we follow it of course
gandalf i think that would be wise
the valley of imladris
in the common tongue
its known by another name
rivendell
gandalf here lies the last homely house
east of the sea
this was your plan all along
to seek refuge with our enemy
you have no enemies here
thorin oakenshield
the only illwill to be found in this
valley is that which you bring yourself
thorin you think the elves
will give our quest their blessing
they will try to stop us
of course they will
but we have questions
that need to be answered
if we are to be successful this
will need to be handled with tact
and respect
and no small degree of charm
which is why you will
leave the talking to me
lindir mithrandir
ah lindir
stay sharp
i must speak with lord elrond
my lord elrond is not here
not here
where is he
hunting horn
thorin speaks dwelvish
close ranks
gandalf
lоrd εlrоn
strange for orcs to come
so close to our borders
something or someone has drawn them near
gandalf ah that may have been us
welcome thorin son of thráin
i do not believe we have met
you have your grandfathers bearing
i knew thrór when he ruled
under the mountain
indeed he made no mention of you
speaks elvish
gloin what is he saying
does he offer us insult
no master glóin hes offering you food
ah well
in that case lead on
try it just a mouthful
i dont like green food
wheres the meat
have they got any chips
gandalf kind of you to invite us
im not really dressed for diner
elrond well you never are
elrond this is orcrist
the goblin cleaver
a famous blade forged by
the high elves of the west
my kin
may it serve you well
and this is glamdring
the foe hammer
sword of the king of gondolin
these swords were made for
the goblin wars of the first
balin i wouldnt bother laddie
swords are named for the
great deeds they do in war
whatre you saying my
sword hasnt seen battles
im not actually sure it is a sword
more of a letter opener really
elrond how did you come with these
gandalf we found them in a
troll hoard on the great east road
shortly before we were ambushed by orcs
and what were you doing
on the great east road
thorin our business is no concern of elves
gandalf for goodness sake
thorin show him the map
thorin it is the legacy of my people
its mine to protect
as are its secrets
gandalf save me from
the stubbornness of dwarves
your pride will be your downfall
you stand here in the presence of one of the
few in middleearth who can read that map
show it to lord elrond
elrond erebor
what is your interest in this map
gandalf its mainly academic
as you know this sort of artifacts
sometimes contains hidden texts
you still read ancient dwarvish
do you not
elrond yeah cirth ithil
gandalf moon runes
of course
an easy thing to miss
elrond and in this case that is true
moon runes can only be read by the light
of the moon of the same shape and season
as the day on which they were written
thorin can you read them
elrond these runes were written
on a midsummers eve
by the light of a crescent moon
nearly two hundred years ago
it would seem you were meant
to come to rivendell
fate is with you thorin oakenshield
the same moon shines upon us tonight
stand by the grey stone
when the thrush knocks
and the setting sun with the
last light of durins day
will shine upon the key hole
bilbo durins day
gandalf it the dwarves new year
when the last moon of autumn and the first
sun of winter appear in the sky together
thorin this is ill news
summer is passing
durins day will soon be upon us
balin we still have time
bilbo time for what
balin to find the entrance
we have to be standing at exactly
the right spot at exactly the right time
then and only then
can the door be opened
elrond so this is your purpose
to enter the mountain
thorin what of it
elrond there are some
who would not deem it wise
gandalf who do you mean
you are not the only guardian
to stand watching over middle earth
bombur
everyone laughing
gandalf with or without our help
these dwarves will march on the mountain
theyre determined to
reclaim their homeland
i do not believe thorin oakenshield
feels that hes answerable to anyone
elrond nor for that matter am i
cause its not me they must answer to
lady galadriel
mithrandir
gandalf d no idea lord elrond had sent for you
saruman he didnt
i did
saruman
youve been busy of late my friend
tell me gandalf
did you think these plans and schemes
of yours would go unnoticed
gandalf unnoticed
no i
im simply doing what i feel to be right
galadriel the dragon
has long been on your mind
gandalf it is true my lady
smaug owes allegiance to no one
but if he should side with the enemy
the dragon could be used
to terrible effect
saruman what enemy
gandalf the enemy is defeated
sauron is vanquished
he can never regain his full strength
gandalf
for four hundred years
we have lived in peace
a hard won watchful peace
gandalf are we are we at peace
trolls have come down from the mountains
they are raiding villages
destroying farms
orcs have attacked us on the road
elrond hardly a prelude to war
saruman always you must meddle
looking for trouble where none exist
galadriel let him speak
gandalf there is something at work
beyond the evil of smaug
something far more powerful
we can remain blind to it but it will not
be ignoring us that i can promise you
a sickness hides over the greenwood
the woodsmen who live there now call it
mirkwook and uh they s  they say
saruman well dont stop now
tell us what the woodsmen say
gandalf they speak of a necromancer
living in dol guldur
a sorcerer who would summon the dead
saruman thats absurd
no such power exists in this world
this necromancer is
nothing more than a mortal man
a conjurer dabbling in black magic
gandalf and so i though too but
radagast has seen
radagast has seen
radagast
do not speak to me of radagast the brown
hes a foolish fellow
well hes odd i grant you
he lives a solitary life
saruman its not that
its his excessive
consumption of mushrooms
theyve addled his brain
and yellowed his teeth
i warned him
it is unbefitting one of
the istari wandering the wood
galadriel vo you carry something
it came to you from radagast
he found it in dul guldur
gandalf yes
galadriel show me
saruman keeps on speaking
what is that
galadriel a relic of mordor
elrond a morgul blade
galadriel made for the witchking of angmar
and buried with him
when angmar fell
the men of the north took his body
and all that he possessed was sealed
within the high fells of rhudaur
deep within the rock they buried him
in a tomb so dark
it couldnt have come to light
elrond this is not possible
a powerful spell lies upon those tombs
they cannot be opened
saruman what proof do we have
this weapon came from angmars grave
gandalf i have none
saruman because there is none
let us examine what we know
a single orc pack has dared
to cross the bruinen
a dagger from a bygone
age has been found
and a human sorcerer
who calls himself the necromancer
has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress
its not so very much after all
the question of this dwarvish company
however troubles me deeply
im not convinced gandalf
i do not feel i can condone such a quest
if they come to me i might just
spare them this disappointment
i will not pretend to understand
your reasons for raising their hopes
galadriel vo they are leaving
saruman still speaking
gandalf yes
galadriel you knew
saruman still speaking
saruman  im afraid theres nothing else for it
lindir my lord elrond
the dwarves
theyve gone
thorin be on your guard
were about to step over
the edge of the wild
balin you know this path lead on
balin ah aye
thorin master baggins
i suggest you keep up
galadriel vo you will follow them
gandalf yes
galadriel you are right to help thorin oakenshield
but i fear this quest has set in motion
forces we do not yet understand
the riddle of the morgul
blade must be answered
something moves in the shadows unseen
hidden from our side
it will not show itself
not yet
but every day it grows in strength
you must be careful
gandalf yes
galadriel mithrandir
why the halfling
gandalf i dont know
saruman believes that it is only a great
power that can hold evil in check
but that is not what i have found
i found it is the small things
everyday deeds of ordinary folk
that keep the darkness at bay
simple acts of kindness and love
why bilbo baggins
perhaps it is because i am afraid
and he gives me courage
galadriel do not be afraid mithrandir
you are not alone
thunder
alright hold on
bilbo slips all shout
thorin we must find shelter
dwalin look out
bifur hold on
balin this is no thunderstorms
