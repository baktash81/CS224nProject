you asked me once if i had told you
everything there was to know about my   
adventures 
and while i can honestly say
i have told you the truth   
i may not have told you all of it 
i am old now frodo 
i m not the same hobbit i once was 
i think it is time for you to know   
what really happened 
it began long ago 
in a land far away to the east 
the like of which you will
not find in the world today 
there was the city of dale 
its market s known far and wide 
full of the bounties of fine and vail 
peaceful and prosperous 
for this city laid before the doors
of the greatest kingdom in middle  earth   
erebor 
stronghold of thrór 
king under the mountain 
the mightiest of the dwarf lords 
thrór ruled with utter surety 
never doubting his house would endure 
for his line lay secure
in the lives of his son   
and grandson 
ah  frodo  erebor 
built deep within the mountain itself 
the beauty of this fortress
city was a legend 
its wealth lay in the earth 
in precious gems humed from rock 
and in great seams of gold
running like rivers through stone 
the skill of the dwarves was unequaled 
fashioning object of great beauty 
out of diamond  emerald 
ruby and sapphire 
ever they delved deeper
down into the dark 
and that is where they found it 
the heart of the mountain   
the arkenstone 
thrór named it the king s jewel 
he took it as a sign  a sign
that his right to rule was divine 
all would pay homage to him 
even the great elven king  thranduil 
but the years of peace and
plenty were not to last 
slowly the days turned sour 
and the watchful nights closed in 
thrór s love of gold
had grown too fierce   
a sickness had begun to grow within him 
it was a sickness of the mind 
and where sickness thrives   
bad things will follow 
the first they heard was a noise like
a hurricane  coming down from the north 
the pines on the mountain creaked
and cracked in the hot dry wind 
thorin  balin  sound the alarm 
call out the guards  do it now 
balin  what is it 
dragon 
dragon 
old bilbo  v o    he was a firedrake from the north 
smaug    had come 
such wanton death was dealt that day 
for this city of men was nothing to smaug 
his eye was set on another price 
for dragons covet gold   
with a dark and fierce desire 
no 
erebor    was lost 
for a dragon will guard his plunder
as long as he lives 
run for your lives 
help us 
thranduil would not risk the lives of
his kin against the lawth of the dragon 
no help came from the elves that day 
nor any day since 
robbed of their homeland  the dwarves
of erebor wandered the wilderness 
the once mighty people brought low 
the young dwarf prince took
work where he could find it 
laboring in the villages of men 
but always  he remembered   
the mountain smoke beneath the moon 
the trees like torches blazing bright 
where he had seen dragon fire in the sky 
and a city turn to ash 
and he never forgave   
and he never forgot 
that  my dear frodo  is where i come in 
for quite by chance 
and the will of a wizard 
fate decided i would
become part of this tale 
it began   
well  it began as you might expect 
in a hole in the ground 
there lived a hobbit 
not a nasty  dirty wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells 
this was a hobbit home 
and that means good
food  a warm house   
and all the comforts of home 
old bilbo  thank you 
frodo  what s this 
that is private 
keep your sticky paws off 
it s not ready yet 
not ready for what 
reading 
old bilbo  what on earth are these 
frodo  replies to the party invitations 
good gracious 
is it today 
they all say they re coming 
except for the sackville  bagginses 
who re demanding you ask them in person 
old bilbo  are they  indeed 
over my dead body 
they d probably find that quite agreeable 
they seem to think you have tunnels
overflowing with gold 
it was one small chest 
hardly overflowing 
and it still smells of troll 
what on earth are you doing 
taking precautions 
you know i caught her making off
with the silverware once 
frodo  who 
old bilbo  lobelia sackville  baggins 
she had all my spoons
stuffed in her pockets 
dreadful woman 
make sure you keep an eye
on her after i m   
when i m    when   
when you re    what 
it s nothing    nothing 
frodo  you know  some people are
beginning to wonder about you 
they think you re becoming odd 
  odd 
  hmm   
unsociable 
unsociable  me 
nonsense 
be a good lad and put that on the gate 
do you think he will come 
who 
gandalf 
oh  he wouldn t miss a chance
to let off his wiz poppers 
he ll give us quite a show  you ll see 
frodo  right then  i am off 
frodo  right then  i am off 
  off to where 
frodo  eastfarthing woods 
i m going to surprise him 
old bilbo  well go on then 
you don t want to be late 
old bilbo  he doesn t approve being late 
not that i ever was 
in those days  i was always on time 
i was entirely respectable   
and nothing unexpected   
ever happened 
an unexpected journey
  good morning 
  what do you mean 
do you mean to wish me a good morning 
or do you mean that it is a good
morning whether i want it or not 
or perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular morning   
or are you simply stating that
this is a morning to be good on 
all of them at once  i suppose 
can i help you 
it remains to be seen 
i m looking for someone
to share in an adventure 
an adventure 
no  i don t imagine
anyone west of bree 
who d have much interest in adventures 
nasty  disturbing   
uncomfortable things 
make you late for dinner 
good morning 
to think that i should have lived to be
good  morninged by belladonna took s son 
as if i was selling buttons at the door 
beg your pardon 
you ve changed  and not entirely
for the better  bilbo baggins 
i m sorry  do i know you 
would you know my name  although
you don t remember i belong to it 
i m gandalf   
and gandalf means   
me 
not gandalf  the wandering wizard
who made such excellent fireworks 
old took used to have
them on midsummer s eve 
i had no idea you were still in business 
and where else should i be 
well   
well  i m pleased to find
you remember something about me   
even if it s only my fireworks 
so that s decided 
it will be very good for you   
and most amusing for me 
i shall inform the others 
inform the who  what  no  no 
no  wait 
we do not want any adventures here 
thank you  not today  not   
i suggest you try over the hill
or    across the water

of our kin  he will come 
  dori  mr  gandalf 
  hmm 
a little glass of red wine as requested 
it s got a fruity bouquet 
cheers 
 big talking noise 
  balin 
  catch 
who wants an ale  there you go 
oin  let me have another drink 
balin  here you go 
hey  on the count of three 
one  two 
come 
 they belch 
ex   excuse me  that is a doily 
not a dish cloth 
bofur  but it s full of holes 
bilbo  it s supposed to look like that 
it s crochet 
oh  and a wonderful game it is too 
if you got the balls for it 
bebother and confusticate these dwarves 
gandalf  my dear bilbo 
what on earth is the matter 
what s the matter 
i am surrounded by dwarves 
what they re doing here 
oh  they re quite a merry gathering   
once you get used to  em 
i don t want to get used to them 
look at the state of my kitchen 
there s mud trodding the carpet 
they   they ve pillaged the pantry 
i m not even gonna tell you
what they ve done in the bathroom 
they ve all but destroyed the plumbing 
i don t understand what
they re doing in my house 
ori  excuse me  i m sorry to interrupt 
but what sha d do with my plate 
fili  here you go  ori  give it to me 
excuse me 
that s my mother s westfarthing pottery 
it s over a hundred years old 
 doing music with kitchenware 
bilbo  and   and ca   can you not do that 
you ll blunt them 
ooh  d you hear that  lads 
he says we ll blunt the knives 
  blunt the knives  bend the forks 
  smash the bottles and burn the corks 
  chip the glasses and crack the plates 
  that s what bilbo baggins hates 
  cut the cloth and tread on the fat 
  leave the bones on the bedroom mat 
  pour the milk on the pantry floor 
  splash the wine on every door 
  dump the crocks in a boiling bowl 
  pound them up with a thumping pole 
  when you ve finished 
if any are whole 
  send them down the hall to roll 
  that s what bilbo baggins hates 
 all dwarves laughing loud 
 somebody hits the door hard 
he s here 
gandalf 
i thought you said this place
would be easy to find 
i lost my way  twice 
i wouldn t have found it at all 
had it not been for that mark on the door 
bilbo  mark  there s no mark on that door 
it was painted a week ago 
gandalf  there is a mark 
i have put it there myself 
bilbo baggins  allow me to introduce
the leader of our company 
thorin oakenshield 
so   
this is the hobbit 
tell me mr  baggins 
have you done much fighting 
pardon me 
axe or sword  what s
your weapon of choice 
well  i do have some skill at conkers 
if you must know 
but i fail to see    why that s relevant 
i thought as much 
he looks more like a grocer
than a burglar 
 laughs 
balin  what news from the meeting in ered luin 
did they all come 
did they all come 
  aye 
envoys from all seven kingdoms 
dwalin  and what did the dwarves
of the iron hill say 
is dain with us 
they will not come 
thorin  they say this quest is ours 
and ours alone 
bilbo  you re doing a quest 
gandalf  bilbo  my dear fellow 
let us have a little more light 
far to the east 
over ranges and rivers 
beyond woodlands and wastelands 
lies a single solitary peak 
bilbo  the lonely mountain 
gloin  aye  óin has read the portents 
and the portents say  it is time 
oin  ravens have been seen flying back
to the mountain as it was foretold 
when the birds of the old return to erebor 
the reign of the beast will end 
bilbo  uh   
what beast 
bofur  well that would be a reference
to smaug the terrible 
chiefest and greatest
calamity of our age 
airborne fire breather   
teeth like razors  claws like meat hooks 
extremely fond of precious metals 
extremely fond of precious metals 
  yes  i know what a dragon is 
i m not afraid  i m up for it 
i ll give him a taste of the dwarfish
iron right up his jacksy 
 cheers 
dori  sit down 
balin  the task would be difficult enough
with an army behind us 
but we number just thirteen   
and not thirteen of the best   
nor brightest 
ori  hey  who you re calling dimp 
fili  we may be few in number 
but we re fighters   
all of us 
to the last one 
kili  and you forget we have
a wizard in our company 
gandalf will have killed
hundreds of dragons in his time 
oh  well no  uh  i 
i wouldn t say 
dori  how many then 
how many then 
  what 
well  how many dragons have you killed 
dori  go on  give us a number 
uh    give me   please  please 
thorin  enough 
if we have read these signs  do you not
think others will have read them too 
rumors have begun to spread 
the dragon smaug has not
been seen for 60 years 
eyes look east to the mountain 
assessing    wondering 
weighing the risk 
perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected  do we sit back   
while others claim
what is rightfully ours 
or do we seize this chance
to take back erebor  
 thorin speaks darwish 
balin  you forget the front gate is sealed 
there is no way into the mountain 
gandlaf  that  my dear balin 
is not totally true 
thorin  how came you by this    
gandalf  it was given to me by your father   
by thráin    for safekeeping 
it is yours now 
kili  if there is a key    there must be a door 
these runes speak of a hidden
passage to the lower halls 
there s another way in 
well  if we can find it  but dwarf
doors are invisible when closed 
the answer lies hidden
somewhere in this map 
and i do not have the skill
to find it  but   
there are others in middle  earth who can 
the task i have in mind will require
a great deal of stealth 
and no small amount of courage 
but if we re careful and clever 
i believe that it can be done 
ori  that s why we need a burglar 
bilbo  hmm  and a good one too 
an expert  i would imagine 
gloin  and are you 
bilbo  am i what 
oin  he said he s an expert 
me  no  no no no no 
i   i m not a burglar 
i ve never stolen a thing in my life 
and i m afraid i have
to agree with mr  baggins 
he s hardly burglar material 
aye  the wild is no place for gentle folk who
can neither fight nor fend for themselves 
 all dwarves speak heatedly 
enough  if i say bilbo baggins is
a burglar  then a burglar he is 
hobbits are remarkably
light on their feet 
in fact  they can pass unseen
by most if they choose   
and while the dragon is accustomed
to the smell of a dwarf 
the scent of a hobbit is all
about unknown to him 
which gives us a distinct advantage 
you asked me to find the
14th member of this company 
and i have chosen mr  baggins 
there s a lot more into him
than his appearances suggest 
and he s got a great deal more
to offer than any of you know   
including himself 
you must trust me on this 
very well   
we ll do it your way 
we ll do it your way 
  blibo  no  no 
give him your contract 
  bofur  we re in 
  bilbo  please 
bofur  we re off 
it s just the usual  summary
about the pocket expenses   
time required  remuneration 
funeral arrangements  so forth 
funeral arrangements 
ooh   
we cannot guarantee his safety 
understood 
we will not be responsible for his fate 
agreed 
    total s cash on delivery
up to but not exceeding
one fourteenth of total
profit if any   seems fair 
 the present company shall not be liable
for injuries inflicted by or sustained
as a consequence thereof 
including  but not limited to   
lacerations   
evisceration 
incineration 
oh  aye  he ll melt the flesh off
your bones in the blink of an eye 
hu   
you alright  laddie 
you alright  laddie 
  huh  yeah  i fe 
 blows 
feel a bit faint 
think furnace  with wings 
think furnace  with wings 
  hey  i  i  i need air 
bofur  flash of light  searing pain  and puf 
you re nothing more than a pile of ash 
no 
oh  very helpful  bofur 
i ll be alright  just    let me   
sit quietly for a moment 
you ve been sitting quietly
for far too long 
gandalf  tell me   
when did doilies    and your mother s
dishes become so important to you 
i remember a young hobbit who was always
running off in search of elves  in woods 
he would stay out late 
come home  after dark  trailing
mud and twigs and fireflies 
a young hobbit who would ve liked
nothing better than to find out
what was beyond the borders of the shire 
the world is not in your books and maps 
it s out there 
i can t just go running off into the blue 
i am a baggins    of bagg end 
you are also a took 
did you know that your great great
great great uncle  bullroarer took 
was so large  he could ride a real horse 
yes  well he could 
in the battle of greenfields 
he charged the goblin ranks
he swung his club so hard  it knocked
the goblin king s head clean off 
and it sailed a hundred yards through
the air  and went down a rabbit hole 
and thus the battle as won   
and the game of golf
invented at the same times 
bilbo  i do believe you made that up 
gandalf  well  all good stories
deserve embellishment 
you ll have a tale or two to tell
of your own when you come back 
can you promise that i will come back 
no   
and if you do   
you ll not be the same 
that s what i thought 
sorry  gandalf  i can t sign this 
you ve got the wrong hobbit 
balin  it appears we have lost our burglar 
probably for the best 
the odds were always against us 
after all  what are we 
merchants  minors   
tinkers  toy makers 
hardly the stuff of legend 
there are a few warriors amongst us 
old warriors 
thorin  i would take each and every one of these
dwarves over an army from the iron hills   
for when i called upon them 
they answered 
loyalty   
honor   
a willing heart    
i can ask no more than that 
you don t have to do this 
you have a choice 
you ve done honorably by our people 
yоu hаvе buіlt а nеw lіfе
fоr uѕ іn thе βluе μоuntаіnѕ   
a life of peace and plenty 
a life that is worth more
than all the gold in erebor 
from my grandfather to my father 
this has come to me 
they dreamt of the day when the dwarves
of erebor would reclaim their homeland 
there is no choice  balin 
not for me 
balin  then we are with you  laddie 
we will see it done 
  far over the misty mountains cold
  to dungeons deep and caverns old
  we must away ere break of day
  to find our long forgotten gold
  the pines were roaring on the height
  the winds were moaning in the night
  the fire was red  it flaming spread
  the trees like torches
blazed with light 
hello 
passerby  hey  mr  bilbo  where re you after 
bilbo  i can t stop  i m already late 
late for what 
i m going on an adventure 
bilbo  wait 
wait 
i signed it 
balin  everything appears to be in order 
welcome  master baggins   
in the company of thorin oakenshield 
thorin  give him a pony 
no  no no no  that 
that won t be necessary 
i can   i am sure i can keep up on foot 
yeah  i   i ve done my fair share of   
walking holidays  you know 
even got as far as the frog mountain once 
oin  come on nori  pay up 
a dwarf  one more 
bilbo  what s that about 
gandalf  oh they took wagers   
on whether or not you would turn up 
most of them bet that you wouldn t 
and what did you think 
my dear fellow   
i never doubted of you for a second 
oh it s horsehair 
having a reaction 
uh   
wait  wait  stop 
bilbo  stop  we have to turn around 
gandalf  what on earth is the matter 
i forgot my handkerchief 
bofur  here 
use this 
dwalin  move on 
gandalf  you ll have to manage
without pocket handkerchiefs 
and a good many other
things  bilbo baggins 
before we reach our journey s end 
you were born to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the shire 
but home is now behind you 
the world is ahead 
 dwarves snore 
 all snore heavily 
bilbo  good girl 
here s a good girl 
it s our little secret  myrtle 
just tell no one  shh shh   
 screams 
what was that 
orcs 
orcs 
fili  throat cutters 
there d be dozens of them out there 
the low lands are crawling with them 
kili  they strike  in the wee small hours 
when everyone s asleep 
quick and quiet  no screams 
just lots of blood 
thorin  you think that s funny 
you think a night raid by orcs is a joke 
we didn t mean anything by it 
thorin  no you didn t 
you know nothing of the world 
balin  don t mind him  laddie 
thorin has more cause
than most to hate orcs 
balin  con t   after the dragon
took the lonely mountain 
king thrór tried to reclaim
the ancient dwarf kingdom of moria 
balin  cont d   but our enemy
had got  there first 
moria had been taken by legions of orcs 
led by the most vile of all their race   
azog    the defiler 
the giant gundabad orc had sworn
to wipe out the line of durin 
he began   
by beheading the king 
 azog screams 
noooooo 
balin  cont d   thráin  thorin s father 
was driven mad by grief 
he went missing  taken prisoner
or killed  we did not know 
we were leaderless 
defeat   
and death   
were upon us 
that is when    i saw him 
a young dwarf prince
facing down the pale orc 
he stood alone against this terrible foe 
his armor rent  wielding nothing
but an oaken branch as a shield 
azog the defiler learned that day 
that the line of durin
would not be so easily broken 
 thorin shouting in dwarvish 
our forces rallied  and
drove the orcs back 
our enemy had been defeated   
but there was no feast 
nor song that night   
for our dead were beyond
the count of grief 
we few  had survived   
and i thought to myself then   
there is one    who i could follow   
there is one   
i could call king 
bilbo  and the pale orc 
what happened to him 
thorin  he slunk back into the hall
whence he came 
that filth died of his wounds long ago 
 wargs growl 
dori  there  mr  gandalf 
can t you do something about this deluge 
it is raining  master dwarf 
and it will continue to rain
until the rain is done 
if you wish to change
the weather of the world 
you should find yourself another wizard 
are there any 
are there any 
  what 
  other wizards 
  other wizards 
  there are five others 
the greatest of our order
is saruman  the white 
then there are the two blue wizards   
d you know  i have quite
forgotten their names 
and who is the fifth 
well  that would be radagast  the brown 
is he a great wizard or is he   
more like you 
i think he s a very great wizard   
in his own way 
he s a gentle soul who prefers
the company of animals to others 
he keeps a watchful eye over
the vast forestlands to the east 
and a good thing too  for always evil will
look to find a foothold in this world

dwalin  ooh  get your foot out of my back 
thorin  where did you go to  if i may ask 
gandalf  to look ahead 
thorin  what brought you back 
gandalf  looking behind 
nasty business 
still they all are in one piece 
no thanks to your burglar 
he had the nose to play for time 
none of the rest of you thought of that 
gandalf  they must have come down
from the ettenmoors 
thorin  since when the mountain trolls
venture this far south 
gandalf  oh  not for an age   
not since a darker power
ruled these lands 
they could not have moved in daylight 
thorin  there must be a cave nearby 
ofur  oh what s that stench  
gandalf  it s a troll hoard 
be careful what you touch 
 all dwarves cough from the smell 
bofur  seems a shame just to
leave it lying around 
anyone could take it 
gloin  agreed 
nori  come here 
get a shovel 
thorin  these swords were not made by any troll 
gandalf  nor were they made
by any smith among men 
these were forged in gondolin   
by the high elves  of the first age 
you could not wish for a finer blade 
gloin  kíli  come  come 
nori  alright  come 
gloin  we re making a long term deposit 
thorin  let s get out of this foul place 
come on  let s go 
bofur  glóin  nori 
  gandalf  bilbo 
  hm 
here  this is about your size 
i can t take this 
the blade is of elvish make  which means
it will glow blue when
orcs or goblins are nearby 
i   i have never used a sword in my life 
and i hope you ll never have to 
but if you do  remember this 
true courage    is about knowing not when
to take a life   
but when to spare one 
dwalin  something s coming 
bilbo  gandalf 
gandalf  stay together 
hurry  they re armed 
arm yourselves 
radagast  thieves  fire  murder 
gandalf  radagast 
it s radagast the brown 
gandalf  what on earth are you doing here 
i was looking for you  gandalf 
something s wrong 
something s terribly wrong 
yes 
radagast  just give me a minute  hm   
no   
i had a thought and 
now i ve lost it  it was 
it was was right there 
on the tip of my tongue 
oh  it s not a thought at all 
it s just only a   
stick insect 
radagast  the greenwood is sick  gandalf 
a darkness has fallen over it 
nothing glows anymore 
at least nothing good 
the air is foul of decay 
but worse are the webs 
gandalf  webs  what do you mean 
radagast  spiders  gandalf 
giant ones 
some kind of spawn of    ungoliant 
or i m not a wizard 
i followed their trail 
they came from    dol guldur 
gandalf  dol guldur 
but the old fortress is abandoned 
no  gandalf 
it is not 
radagast  cont d  
a dark power dwells in there   
such as i have never felt before 
it is the shadow of an ancient aura 
one that can summon
the spirits of the dead 
i saw him  gandalf 
from out of the darkness   
the necromancer has come 
sorry 
gandalf  try a little old toby 
it ll help setting your nerves 
then out 
now    the necromancer 
are you sure 
radagast  that is not    from the world   
of the living 
 howlings 
was that a wolf  are there 
are there wolves out there 
wolves 
no  that is not a wolf 
 growls 
thorin  warg scouts 
which means an orc pack is not far behind 
orc pack 
who did you tell about
your quest  beyond your kin 
no one 
who did you tell 
no one  i swear 
what in dorin s name is going on 
you re being hunted 
dwalin  we have to get out of here 
ori  we can t  we have no ponies 
they bolted 
radagast  i ll draw them off 
gandalf  these are gundabad wargs 
they will outrun you 
these are rhosgobel rabbits 
i d like to see them try 
 wargs howl 
come and get me 
 radagast laughing 
 wargs bark 
gandalf  come on 
stay together  move 
thorin  ori  no 
come back 
all of you  come on 
come on  quick 
thorin  where re you leading us 
gandalf  move 
run 
gloin  there they are 
gandalf  this way 
quickly 
kili  i think there s more coming 
thorin  kíli  shoot them 
fili  we re surrounded 
fili  where s gandalf 
dwalin  he s abandoned us 
thorin  hold your ground 
gandalf  this way  you fools 
thorin  com on  move 
quickly  all of you 
thorin  go  go  go 
gandalf     nine  ten   
kíli 
run 
 hunting horn 
 noise of arrows 
elves 
dwalin  i cannot see where the pathway leads 
do we follow it or no 
bofur  we follow it  of course 
gandalf  i think that would be wise 
the valley of imladris 
in the common tongue 
it s known by another name 
rivendell 
gandalf  here lies the last homely house 
east of the sea 
this was your plan all along   
to seek refuge with our enemy 
you have no enemies here 
thorin oakenshield 
the only ill will to be found in this
valley is that which you bring yourself 
thorin  you think the elves   
will give our quest their blessing 
they will try to stop us 
of course  they will 
but we have questions
that need to be answered 
if we are to be successful  this
will need to be handled with tact   
and respect   
and no small degree of charm 
which is why you will
leave the talking to me 
lindir  mithrandir 
ah  lindir 
stay sharp 
i must speak with lord elrond 
my lord elrond is not here 
not here 
where is he 
 hunting horn 
 thorin speaks dwelvish 
close ranks 
gandalf 
lоrd εlrоn 
strange for orcs to come
so close to our borders 
something or someone has drawn them near 
gandalf  ah  that may have been us 
welcome thorin  son of thráin 
i do not believe we have met 
you have your grandfather s bearing 
i knew thrór when he ruled
under the mountain 
indeed  he made no mention of you 
 speaks elvish 
gloin  what is he saying 
does he offer us insult 
no master glóin  he s offering you food 
ah well   
in that case  lead on 
try it  just a mouthful 
i don t like green food 
where s the meat 
have they got any chips 
gandalf  kind of you to invite us 
i m    not really dressed for diner 
elrond  well  you never are 
elrond  this is orcrist   
the goblin  cleaver 
a famous blade  forged by
the high elves of the west 
my kin 
may it serve you well 
and this is glamdring   
the foe  hammer 
sword of the king of gondolin 
these swords were made for
the goblin wars of the first 
balin  i wouldn t bother  laddie 
swords are named for the
great deeds they do in war 
what re you saying  my
sword hasn t seen battles 
i m not actually sure it is a sword 
more of a letter opener  really 
elrond  how did you come with these 
gandalf  we found them in a
troll hoard on the great east road 
shortly before we were ambushed by orcs 
and what were you doing
on the great east road 
thorin  our business is no concern of elves 
gandalf  for goodness sake 
thorin  show him the map 
thorin  it is the legacy of my people 
it s mine to protect 
as are its secrets 
gandalf  save me from
the stubbornness of dwarves 
your pride will be your downfall 
you stand here in the presence of one of the
few in middle earth who can read that map 
show it to lord elrond 
elrond  erebor 
what is your interest in this map 
gandalf  it s mainly academic 
as you know  this sort of artifacts
sometimes contains hidden texts 
you still read ancient dwarvish 
do you not 
elrond  yeah   cirth ithil  
gandalf  moon runes   
of course 
an easy thing to miss 
elrond  and in this case  that is true 
moon runes can only be read by the light
of the moon of the same shape and season
as the day on which they were written 
thorin  can you read them 
elrond  these runes were written
on a mid summer s eve
by the light of a crescent moon
nearly two hundred years ago 
it would seem you were meant
to come to rivendell 
fate is with you  thorin oakenshield 
the same moon shines upon us tonight 
 stand by the grey stone
when the thrush knocks  
 and the setting sun with the
last light of durin s day
will shine upon the key  hole  
bilbo  durin s day 
gandalf  it the dwarves  new year 
when the last moon of autumn and the first
sun of winter appear in the sky together 
thorin  this is ill news 
summer is passing 
durin s day will soon be upon us 
balin  we still have time 
bilbo  time  for what 
balin  to find the entrance 
we have to be standing at exactly
the right spot  at exactly the right time 
then  and only then   
can the door be opened 
elrond  so this is your purpose 
to enter the mountain 
thorin  what of it 
elrond  there are some
who would not deem it wise 
gandalf  who do you mean 
you are not the only guardian
to stand watching over middle  earth 
bombur 
 everyone laughing 
gandalf  with or without our help 
these dwarves will march on the mountain 
they re determined to
reclaim their homeland 
i do not believe thorin oakenshield
feels that he s answerable to anyone 
elrond  nor for that matter am i 
cause it s not me they must answer to 
lady galadriel 
mithrandir 
gandalf   d no idea lord elrond had sent for you 
saruman  he didn t 
i did 
saruman 
you ve been busy of late  my friend 
tell me  gandalf   
did you think these plans and schemes
of yours would go unnoticed 
gandalf  unnoticed 
no  i   
i m simply doing what i feel to be right 
galadriel  the dragon   
has long been on your mind 
gandalf  it is true  my lady 
smaug owes allegiance to no one 
but if he should side with the enemy 
the dragon could be used
to terrible effect 
saruman  what enemy 
gandalf  the enemy is defeated 
sauron is vanquished 
he can never regain his full strength 
gandalf   
for four hundred years 
we have lived in peace 
a hard won watchful peace 
gandalf  are we  are we at peace 
trolls have come down from the mountains 
they are raiding villages 
destroying farms 
orcs have attacked us on the road 
elrond  hardly a prelude to war 
saruman  always you must meddle 
looking for trouble where none exist 
galadriel  let him speak 
gandalf  there is something at work
beyond the evil of smaug 
something far more powerful 
we can remain blind to it  but it will not
be ignoring us  that i can promise you 
a sickness hides over the greenwood 
the woodsmen who live there now call it
mirkwook  and uh  they s   they say   
saruman  well  don t stop now 
tell us what the woodsmen say 
gandalf  they speak of a necromancer 
living in dol guldur 
a sorcerer who would summon the dead 
saruman  that s absurd 
no such power exists in this world 
this    necromancer is
nothing more than a mortal man 
a conjurer dabbling in black magic 
gandalf  and so i though too  but   
radagast has seen 
radagast has seen 
  radagast 
do not speak to me of radagast the brown 
he s a foolish fellow 
well    he s odd  i grant you 
he lives a solitary life 
saruman  it s not that 
it s his excessive
consumption of mushrooms 
they ve addled his brain 
and yellowed his teeth 
i warned him 
it is unbefitting one of
the istari wandering the wood   
galadriel  v o    you carry something 
it came to you from radagast   
he found it in dul guldur   
gandalf  yes 
galadriel  show me 
 saruman keeps on speaking 
what is that 
galadriel  a relic of mordor 
elrond  a morgul blade   
galadriel  made for the witch king of angmar 
and buried with him 
when angmar fell 
the men of the north took his body 
and all that he possessed was sealed
within the high fells of rhudaur 
deep within the rock  they buried him   
in a tomb so dark   
it couldn t have come to light 
elrond  this is not possible 
a powerful spell lies upon those tombs 
they cannot be opened 
saruman  what proof do we have
this weapon came from angmar s grave 
gandalf  i have none 
saruman  because there is none 
let us examine what we know 
a single orc pack has dared
to cross the bruinen 
a dagger from a by gone
age has been found 
and a human sorcerer
who calls himself the necromancer 
has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress 
it s not so very much  after all 
the question of this dwarvish company
however  troubles me deeply 
i m not convinced  gandalf 
i do not feel i can condone such a quest 
if they come to me  i might just
spare them this disappointment 
i will not pretend to understand
your reasons for raising their hopes   
galadriel  v o    they are leaving 
 saruman still speaking 
gandalf  yes 
galadriel  you knew 
 saruman still speaking 
saruman     i m afraid there s nothing else for it 
lindir  my lord elrond 
the dwarves   
they ve gone 
thorin  be on your guard 
we re about to step over
the edge of the wild 
balin  you know this path  lead on 
balin  ah aye 
thorin  master baggins 
i suggest you keep up 
galadriel  v o    you will follow them 
gandalf  yes 
galadriel  you are right to help thorin oakenshield 
but i fear this quest has set in motion
forces we do not yet understand 
the riddle of the morgul
blade must be answered 
something moves in the shadows  unseen 
hidden from our side 
it will not show itself   
not yet 
but every day it grows in strength 
you must be careful 
gandalf  yes   
galadriel  mithrandir 
why the halfling 
gandalf  i don t know 
saruman believes that it is only a great
power that can hold evil in check 
but that is not what i have found 
i found it is    the small things 
everyday deeds of ordinary folk 
that keep the darkness at bay   
simple acts of kindness and love 
why bilbo baggins 
perhaps it is because i am afraid   
and he gives me courage 
galadriel  do not be afraid  mithrandir 
you are not alone 
 thunder 
alright  hold on 
 bilbo slips  all shout 
thorin  we must find shelter 
dwalin  look out

thorin  no  no fires  not in this place
