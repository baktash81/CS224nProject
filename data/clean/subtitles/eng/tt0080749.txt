enough time for one more story 
one more story before twelve 
just to keep us warm 
in five minutes 
it will be the 21st of april 
one hundred years ago 
on the 21st of april 
out on the waters
around spivey point 
a small clipper ship
drew toward land 
suddenly  out of the night 
the fog rolled in 
for a moment 
they could see nothing 
not a foot ahead of them 
then they saw a light 
by god  it was a fire
burning on the shore 
strong enough to penetrate
the swirling mist 
they steered a course
toward the light 
but it was a campfire
like this one 
the ship crashed
against the rocks 
the hull sheared in two 
the mast snapped like a twig 
and the wreckage sank
with all the men aboard 
at the bottom of the sea
lay the elizabeth dane
with her crew 
their lungs filled
with salt water 
their eyes open and staring
into the darkness 
and above 
as suddenly as it had come 
the fog lifted  receded
back across the ocean 
and never came again 
but it is told by the fishermen
and their fathers
and grandfathers
that when the fog
returns to antonio bay 
the men at the bottom of the sea 
out in the water by spivey point 
will rise up and search
for the campfire
that led them to their
dark and icy death 
twelve o  clock 
the 21st of april 
it s twelve midnight 
and we just started
the little witching hour 
this is stevie wayne

spivey point 
as of 1 57 today 
the sea grass had not responded
to radio communication 
the coast guard has begun a
sweep south from watley 
around arcom reef  and should
be in the area of spivey point
in approximately one hour 
repeating this bulletin
from the coast guard 
be on the look out for the
sea grass  a 30 foot trawler 
last seen approximately 15
miles east of spivey point 
if you sight this vessel  please
notify the coast guard immediately 
  nick  can i ask you a question 
  yeah 
  is it always like this 
  it s always different 
  you re worried  aren t you 
  yeah 
she can get real mean 
there 
oh  yeah 
oh  yeah 
well  if i can just get through
the speeches without yawning 
  i couldn t sleep last night 
  too excited 
no  al went out on his boat last
night and didn t come home 
  he still isn t back 
  mrs  williams 
i called the coast guard 
and they said 
 oh  he might have
had engine trouble  
they said not to worry 
he was complaining
about his boat last week 
maybe you ought to go home 
that s the last place
i want to go 
my dog started to bark
at 12 00 last night
and didn t stop until
6 00 this morning 
what happened 
he was pointed toward
the ocean and growling 
what does that tell you 
my dog goes crazy and
decides to bark at the water 
i heard the church bells at midnight
as i started to drift off to sleep 
and suddenly  my car alarm went
off for absolutely no reason 
  really 
  uh huh 
woke up the whole block 
this town sits around for 100 years
and nothing happens  and then one
night  the whole place falls apart 
al 
take this line  too 
al 
tommy 
dick 
cabin and steering
house are empty 
maybe somebody picked them up 
  there s water in the generator 
  but the deck is as dry as a bone 
there you have it 
my next project  restoration
of the morgantown road cemetery 
it s historical 
  our ancestors are buried here 
  it s gonna cost a lot 
come on  sandy  so  this town
should be proud of its past 
but trying to get anyone involved in
community affairs is like pulling teeth 
better get the estimates ready for
the council meeting next month 
yes  ma am 
sandy  you re the only person
i know who can make
 yes  ma am  sound like
 screw you  
yes  ma am

father malone 
father malone

and i ll look up front 
father malone 
  jesus 
  i m sorry  mrs  williams 
  mrs  williams   
  are you all right 
i have something to show you 
 december 9 
 met with blake this evening
for the first time 
 he stood in the shadows
 to prevent me from getting
a clear look at his face 
 what a vile disease this is 
 he is a rich man
with a cursed condition 
 but this does not prevent him from
trying to better his situation
and that of his comrades
at the colony  
every single gauge is broken 
  all the glass is shattered 
  remind you of something 
  last night 
  your truck 
yeah 
yeah 
the thermometer s broken 
the mercury s stuck at 20 degrees 
there s no water got in here 
but something awful cold did 
 december 11 
blake s proposition is simple 
 he wants to move off
tanzier island
 and relocate the entire
colony just north of here 
 he has purchased a clipper ship
 called the elizabeth dane 
 with part of his fortune
 and asks only for
permission to settle here 
 i must balance my feelings
of mercy and compassion
 toward this poor man with
my revulsion at the thought
of a leper colony
only a mile distant  
it s rusted to the wall 
it was on 
  they drank a lot of beer last night 
  every night 
what s it like 
it s always the same 
room starts spinning   
i mean fishing 
you fish 
the only thing i know about
fishing is you use a lot of worms 
hmm 
salt water 
she was clean 2 nights ago 
i checked her out myself 
and now it s as if she s been
turned over in the water 
 april 20 
the six of us met tonight 
 from midnight until 1 00 
 we planned the death
of blake and his comrades 
 i tell myself that blake s gold
will allow the church to be built
 and our small settlement
to become a township 
 but it does not soothe
the horror that i feel
being an accomplice to murder  
now what 
wait for the coast guard 
  i m sorry 
  what for 
ever since you picked me up 
things have been going wrong 
the clock broke  the windows
have been breaking 
  the weirdo at the door last night 
  that isn t you 
i m not so sure 
things seem to happen to me 
i m bad luck 
i don t believe in luck 
good or bad 
i don t believe in anything much 
something did happen once 
my father was a fisherman 
he ran a trawler
out of whitely reef 
one night  late 
he was coming back in 
he was out beyond the reef 
out near spivey point 
he looked to windward
and saw a brig under shortsail
heading right for him 
and he radioed 
there was no reply 
nothing moved on the deck 
but she held her course 
my dad and two of his hands 
they boarded the brig   
the resa jane 
no one was on board 
there was food on the table   
and a hot  steaming cup of coffee 
but underneath  a tin cup
was rusted to the table 
and then something caught
my father s eye 
it was a gold doubloon
minted in spain  1867 
my dad picked up the coin 
put it in his breast pocket
of his jacket  and zippered it up 
he came home 
told us the story 
and he unzippered the pocket
to give me the coin 
it was gone 
i think i ll go to
vancouver now 
aaah 
 april 21st 
the deed is done 
 blake followed
our false fire on shore 
 and his ship broke apart
on the rocks off spivey point 
 we were aided by
an unearthly fog
 that rolled in
as if heaven sent 
 although god had no part
in our actions tonight 
 blake s gold will be
recovered tomorrow 
but may the lord forgive us
for what we have done  
i couldn t read any further 
your grandfather
had a way with words

your night light   
and k a b  antonio bay 
california 
is on the air 
i ve lined up some tunes
to help you celebrate
the 100th birthday of antonio bay 
so let s get down to business 
what did your mother want  andy 
nothing 
oh  it must have been something 
mm  nothing 
hey  mrs  kobritz 
what are those clouds out there 
evidence of deep
penetrating wounds
in each ocular orbit entering
into the cranial cavity 
also jagged lacerations
to the face   
do you want to wait out front 
i d rather wait with you 
ok 
thorax has been crushed 
and the lungs are
filled with fluid 
talk to you a minute 
yeah 
  she gonna be all right 
  yeah 
did you talk to simms 
i got him on the radio 
he s coming back from bodega bay 
what the hell happened out there 
there was rust all over everything 
it was like the boat
had been out there
a long time  taking on water 
he was down below near the bunks 
nick  his wounds are
covered with algae 
his lungs are full  and there s
silt under his fingernails 
i tell you  i saw dick baxter
three days ago in salinas 
now he s lying in there
on the table
looking like he s been
underwater for a month 
  do you feel that 
  i ll tell you what happens 
  it just got cold in here 
  you see  the water acts like ice 
a whole body would take
a year to decompose 
longer if it was down far enough 
cold enough 
but he was on the boat 
he was below decks 
no 
dick baxter died in the ocean 
you remember last october 
those three kids that went diving
  for that old boat off the point 
  yeah 
we got to  em  they d
been down for a week 
maybe ten days 
i swear to you right now 
he s been down longer 
aah  nick 
and while the wrecking
of that beautiful ship
upon our coast was  of course 
a tragedy to those
who were on the ship 
it still was the catalyst
that brought together
all of the people of
this wonderful area 
they came together 
they formed the charter
for antonio bay 
the charter by which you have
voted for these councilmen
who sit on my left
and my right tonight 
kathy  the coast guard s
looking for them 
now  they re gonna cover
the area pretty good 
so  really 
all we can do is wait 
i understand  sheriff 
thank you 
i got to go  i m up next 
i m so sorry  mrs  williams 
it s funny   
but all i can think about is
my silly dog barking
all night and 
and me just 
just wishing al would come home 
now  we can t have the   
chairlady of the birthday
celebration in tears  can we 
i don t think you ought
to go out there 
oh  i think that s exactly
what i ought to do 
i appreciate all your help  nick 
that s all right 
i searched a long
time for this one 
i hope you remember it 
happy 100th  antonio bay 
the ceremonies are underway
at shelby square 
and we ll have that
candlelight procession
in about an hour 
so if you hurry 
you can still make it 
the coast guard dropped me a note
saying they found the sea grass
earlier this afternoon 
but there s no further word
as to the condition of the ship
or the men on board 
i ll keep you posted
as the news comes in to me 
hope no one else gets lost
out there in the fog 
i ll be right back 
k a b 
hello

you don t know me 
but i m one of the men
who found the sea grass
this afternoon 
oh  i m sorry

any further word 
i understand 
that s not what i called about 
it s    uh  you just mentioned
something now on the
radio about the fog 
well  this is going to
sound a little strange 
i saw the fog last night out
in the ocean in the distance 
it was    glowing 
well  what seemed to
be happening is
that the wind was moving due east 
and the fog just kept moving west 
i know that sounds
completely crazy 
right now it doesn t 
something happened last night 
at the same time that
fog was moving in 
this whole town went unglued 
hold on 
i ve got some more
birthday music for you
and a few other surprises 
then i ll be ready to check in
with the weatherman 
and the weatherman will be
ready to check in with you 
  hello

it may have nothing to
do with the sea grass

driftwood this morning

something came out of the fog
and tried to destroy us 
in one moment  it vanished 
but if this has been
anything but a nightmare
and if we don t wake up to find
ourselves safe in our beds 
it could come again 
to the ships at sea
who can hear my voice
