enough time for one more story
one more story before twelve
just to keep us warm
in five minutes
it will be the 21st of april
one hundred years ago
on the 21st of april
out on the waters
around spivey point
a small clipper ship
drew toward land
suddenly out of the night
the fog rolled in
for a moment
they could see nothing
not a foot ahead of them
then they saw a light
by god it was a fire
burning on the shore
strong enough to penetrate
the swirling mist
they steered a course
toward the light
but it was a campfire
like this one
the ship crashed
against the rocks
the hull sheared in two
the mast snapped like a twig
and the wreckage sank
with all the men aboard
at the bottom of the sea
lay the elizabeth dane
with her crew
their lungs filled
with salt water
their eyes open and staring
into the darkness
and above
as suddenly as it had come
the fog lifted receded
back across the ocean
and never came again
but it is told by the fishermen
and their fathers
and grandfathers
that when the fog
returns to antonio bay
the men at the bottom of the sea
out in the water by spivey point
will rise up and search
for the campfire
that led them to their
dark and icy death
twelve o clock
the 21st of april

spivey point
as of 157 today
the sea grass had not responded
to radio communication
the coast guard has begun a
sweep south from watley
around arcom reef and should
be in the area of spivey point
in approximately one hour
repeating this bulletin
from the coast guard
be on the look out for the
sea grass a 30foot trawler
last seen approximately 15
miles east of spivey point
if you sight this vessel please
notify the coast guard immediately
nick can i ask you a question
yeah
is it always like this
its always different
youre worried arent you
yeah
she can get real mean
there
oh yeah
oh yeah
well if i can just get through
the speeches without yawning
i couldnt sleep last night
too excited
no al went out on his boat last
night and didnt come home
he still isnt back
mrs williams
i called the coast guard
and they said
oh he might have
had engine trouble
they said not to worry
he was complaining
about his boat last week
maybe you ought to go home
thats the last place
i want to go
my dog started to bark
at 1200 last night
and didnt stop until
600 this morning
what happened
he was pointed toward
the ocean and growling
what does that tell you
my dog goes crazy and
decides to bark at the water
i heard the church bells at midnight
as i started to drift off to sleep
and suddenly my car alarm went
off for absolutely no reason
really
uhhuh
woke up the whole block
this town sits around for 100 years
and nothing happens and then one
night the whole place falls apart
al
take this line too
al
tommy
dick
cabin and steering
house are empty
maybe somebody picked them up
theres water in the generator
but the deck is as dry as a bone
there you have it
my next project restoration
of the morgantown road cemetery
its historical
our ancestors are buried here
its gonna cost a lot
come on sandy so this town
should be proud of its past
but trying to get anyone involved in
community affairs is like pulling teeth
better get the estimates ready for
the council meeting next month
yes maam
sandy youre the only person
i know who can make
yes maam sound like
screw you
yes maam
now if well just say a little prayer
asking that he not be in his cups
not a good sign
father malone
father malone
hello
another bad sign
you try the study
and ill look up front
father malone
jesus
im sorry mrs williams
mrs williams
are you all right
i have something to show you
december 9
met with blake this evening
for the first time
he stood in the shadows
to prevent me from getting
a clear look at his face
what a vile disease this is
he is a rich man
with a cursed condition
but this does not prevent him from
trying to better his situation
and that of his comrades
at the colony
every single gauge is broken
all the glass is shattered
remind you of something
last night
your truck
yeah
yeah
the thermometers broken
the mercurys stuck at 20 degrees
theres no water got in here
but something awful cold did
december 11
blakes proposition is simple
he wants to move off
tanzier island
and relocate the entire
colony just north of here
he has purchased a clipper ship
called the elizabeth dane
with part of his fortune
and asks only for
permission to settle here
i must balance my feelings
of mercy and compassion
toward this poor man with
my revulsion at the thought
of a leper colony
only a mile distant
its rusted to the wall
it was on
they drank a lot of beer last night
every night
whats it like
its always the same
room starts spinning
i mean fishing
you fish
the only thing i know about
fishing is you use a lot of worms
hmm
salt water
she was clean 2 nights ago
i checked her out myself
and now its as if shes been
turned over in the water
april 20
the six of us met tonight
from midnight until 100
we planned the death
of blake and his comrades
i tell myself that blakes gold
will allow the church to be built
and our small settlement
to become a township
but it does not soothe
the horror that i feel
being an accomplice to murder
now what
wait for the coast guard
im sorry
what for
ever since you picked me up
things have been going wrong
the clock broke the windows
have been breaking
the weirdo at the door last night
that isnt you
im not so sure
things seem to happen to me
im bad luck
i dont believe in luck
good or bad
i dont believe in anything much
something did happen once
my father was a fisherman
he ran a trawler
out of whitely reef
one night late
he was coming back in
he was out beyond the reef
out near spivey point
he looked to windward
and saw a brig under shortsail
heading right for him
and he radioed
there was no reply
nothing moved on the deck
but she held her course
my dad and two of his hands
they boarded the brig
the resa jane
no one was on board
there was food on the table
and a hot steaming cup of coffee
but underneath a tin cup
was rusted to the table
and then something caught
my fathers eye
it was a gold doubloon
minted in spain 1867
my dad picked up the coin
put it in his breast pocket
of his jacket and zippered it up
he came home
told us the story
and he unzippered the pocket
to give me the coin
it was gone
i think ill go to
vancouver now
aaah
april 21st
the deed is done
blake followed
our false fire on shore
and his ship broke apart
on the rocks off spivey point
we were aided by
an unearthly fog
that rolled in
as if heaven sent
although god had no part
in our actions tonight
blakes gold will be
recovered tomorrow
but may the lord forgive us
for what we have done
i couldnt read any further
your grandfather
had a way with words
our celebration tonight

hey mrs kobritz
what are those clouds out there
evidence of deep
penetrating wounds
in each ocular orbit entering
into the cranial cavity
also jagged lacerations
to the face
do you want to wait out front
id rather wait with you
ok
thorax has been crushed
and the lungs are
filled with fluid
talk to you a minute
yeah
she gonna be all right
yeah
did you talk to simms
i got him on the radio
hes coming back from bodega bay
what the hell happened out there
there was rust all over everything
it was like the boat
had been out there
a long time taking on water
he was down below near the bunks
nick his wounds are
covered with algae
his lungs are full and theres
silt under his fingernails
i tell you i saw dick baxter
three days ago in salinas
now hes lying in there
on the table
looking like hes been
underwater for a month
do you feel that
ill tell you what happens
it just got cold in here
you see the water acts like ice
a whole body would take
a year to decompose
longer if it was down far enough
cold enough
but he was on the boat
he was below decks
no
dick baxter died in the ocean
you remember last october
those three kids that went diving
for that old boat off the point
yeah
we got to em theyd
been down for a week
maybe ten days
i swear to you right now
hes been down longer
aah nick
and while the wrecking
of that beautiful ship
upon our coast was of course
a tragedy to those
who were on the ship
it still was the catalyst
that brought together
all of the people of
this wonderful area
they came together
they formed the charter
for antonio bay
the charter by which you have
voted for these councilmen
who sit on my left
and my right tonight
kathy the coast guards

now theyre gonna cover
the area pretty good
so really
all we can do is wait
