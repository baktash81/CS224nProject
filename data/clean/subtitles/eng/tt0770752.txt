the most fortunate guy in the world
get out of here
i just want you to have the happiness
me and eddie thank god for every day
hes not exaggerating either
we really do that
apparently this makes me
some kind of deranged animal
you make it sound
like i never meant anything to him
all i said was the guy has a tendency
to miss a lot of appointments
behold this dude
whats up
oh my god are you from cuba
lucky for you we happened along
my most superfluously toasted friend
water water

hail neptune whoo
hail neptune whoo
decent rescue
holy shit

mr mccintry
but if hes not here by a quarter past
ill be forced to award everything
to mrs finnegan here
by default
im gonna kill him
do you wanna go to prison
if it gets me out of florida
honey florida didnt ruin your life
you did
you married a guy for the sex
and then expected him to be smart
aah
maybe he had car trouble
car trouble
yeah you know
car trouble
hed have to own a car
which he couldnt even if he wanted to
because he has no money
he has no credit
he has no clue how to behave
like a responsible adult
oh
which is why i cant get a loan
because everything is in our name haha
i cant even pay for school
and finish my degree
which is what i was doing
in the first place
before i got dragged down here
on spring break
but like you said the sex was really
really really great
do you have any idea
how humiliating it is
to get divorced by yourself
your honor this is a big mistake
this woman
and i still love each other
dont do this tess
look i know i messed up all right
but im willing to change in any area
that you feel needs work
i wanna make you happy
ill do anything
ill see a counselor
will you come to chicago with me
like you promised
could be i mean that could work
ill definitely see the counselor
mr finnegan
i cant tell you what a pleasure it is
to inform you that under florida law
you and this woman have been divorced
for the last 50 or 60 seconds
moreover as you were not present
at the time of the proceedings
she got everything
were divorced
im afraid so
why
excuse me
oh wait tess
i gotta tell you what happened
tess
we found it me and alfonz
about a hundred yards off the reef
right where we always said shed be
oh
prove it
excuse me excuse me
you have a pen paper
anybody got a pen pencil
paper anything
your uselessness is epic
what does that mean here we go
all right alfonz and i are diving
and i come across this plate
dinner plate about yay big
its plain white
but this
was stamped on the back
in blue
its the vangor family crest tess
you were right all along
you were right before anybody
where did you find this
a hundred yards off the reef
wow finn oh my god
thats what im saying
wheres the plate
well i dont have it on me
this minute
where do you have it
well its back there
wow
wow
i know what youre thinking tess
but i swear to god its the truth
you can ask alfonz
okay where is he
well hes back there too
i cant believe you would dangle this
in front of me
i cant believe it
you really think id lie about this
why not youre a liar
but this is an inappropriate time
to dwell on that
you i can draw this picture too
hey tess im telling you we solved
a 300yearold mystery yesterday
married or not
if we dont go after that ship
its gonna haunt us the rest of our lives
i wasted eight years of my life
on this bullshit
im going back to chicago
im gonna get my ph d
and im going to spend the rest of my life
teaching reading and writing books
and somewhere in there im gonna meet
an intelligent successful man
who can get through an entire
conversation without using definitely
first of all
i hardly ever say that anymore
and when are you gonna stop selling
this crap about going back to school
you want history
its under the ocean lady
what are you telling me you wanna
spend your life in some dark room
taking notes and writing books
about what some old putz in
another room cooked up in his head
about things
that you have actually seen
and touched and pulled out of the sand
with your own hands
bullshit
im so glad were not married anymore
well where are you gonna get
the tuition money anyway
thats the best part by selling the boat
by selling my boat which belongs to me
which used to belong to us
but you missed the divorce
so now it belongs to me
im gonna fix it up im gonna sell it
and im going back what
this is hard to say
what is
well you act like this is totally my fault
can i borrow this cane
for a second please
oh come on tess
youre not gonna hit me
ugh
sorry
oh my god
oh my god
oh god
i take it they didnt kill you
no
but thanks for your help
you need help
you are not my mother
youre right
i guess maybe i act like your mother
sometimes because i never had one
easy gary easy
okay look the main thing is
we get away from key west
the second finn lays eyes on this boat
hes gonna be onboard in 10 minutes
what do you mean
you told him youre working here
are you kidding
then i dont get it
he needs money gary
another boat new equipment everything
and i doubt hes gonna squeeze
another dime out of that bugs bunny
bugs bunny
the rapper guy we had the fight about
you mean bigg bunny deenz
yeah
bigg bunny deenz is finns investor
yeah
hey gary
he is a very dangerous guy
i did like that one song he had
call me thumper
that was some funny shit
anyway
theres something wrong with my bisque
im sorry honey
anyway
but i dont get it
because has finn ever even met nigel
no but he will dont you understand
he is a genius at exactly three things
treasure salving finding money
for treasure salving and one other thing
what other thing
what other thing
i dont wanna talk about it
how do you plan to get another boat
i cant think about this right now alfonz
i just got divorced
may i make a suggestion
no
you see that big yacht lying offshore
no which one
the owner is nigel honeycutt
so what
i only mention it
because he is worth  700 million
and just to let you know
im back onboard obviously
so whenever you want to weigh anchor
is great
thank you
so should i tell the captain
ready to weigh anchor
ready to push off
actually no
my daughter gemma is joining us today
and i said i would wait here for her
oh great god
when is she coming
where is she coming from
how far away is she how great
i sent the chopper to miami
but she could be anywhere
thats so funny that you would wait
in key west for her
when shes coming by chopper
is it
well just because the helicopter
could just meet the boat anywhere
i mean anywhere at all thats whats
so incredibly great about helicopters
she wants to do some shopping
what do you do tess
im the new steward
but what do you really do
what makes you think i do anything
besides stewarding
stewing stewarding
stewarding stewarding
my infallible lifelong instinct
for sizing people up
have you sized me up
not quite
you dont mind the work
but youre not here for long
you have a deep but not entirely unclouded
love for the sea
you perform your duties
with superlative efficiency and ease
suggestive of someone expending
approximately onetenth
of her available brain power
so
what do you do
with the remaining 90 percent
when youre not getting divorced
i hope im not being too personal
no not at not at all
its just been a crazy couple of years
its probably his helicopter
his daughter
is supposed to be arriving today
the whole town is buzzing
with excitement
hey so where you say
this uh museum is at
number 2 water street
okay uh every street on this island
is called water street
this place has a magic atmosphere
will you just find
the damn address man
yo cordell we got mapquest
on these things
hi daddy
hello darling
hello my baby
daddy
pleasant flight
uhhuh
so um is this the whole boat
yes
oh so cute
i cant believe were at sea
well uh technically were at anchor
oh wait okay so that just means
that the anchor is in the water right
yes
yes
okay because i totally wanna learn
all the sea terms
and so you shall my darling
okay let me try again
excuse me nigel
yes my dear
you know what
lets not do the accent thing
its no good
its fine
um anyway
nigel remember when you asked me
this afternoon what i really did
have fun shopping

that was the bravest thing
ive ever seen in my life
sir thank you so much
thank you
thank you indeed

just a little bump on the head
just try not to move around too much
for the next few hours
but i gotta go back to town

and cocktails at 630
okay thanks
take him to the saint regis
whoa whoa
yep yep yep im good im good
hey mr honeycutt
miss honeycutt
she leave him on the boat
gemma your lifeline
to civilization darling
oh
oh my god i would have been so dead
here you are darling
well mr deenz im always delighted
to welcome an entrant into my field
whether it be on land or sea
but i feel i need to warn you
theres no way
of getting away from treasure
once its fastened itself on your mind
i want you to find me the queens dowry
heh
well now bunny uh
bigg bunny its one word
well thats an emerald
of a different color isnt it
cordell
this is a piece of the plate
that we found in the bahamas
off of topsail cay
now if you turn it over
you may notice that it has
the vangor family crest stamped on it
thats what that is right there
thats very nice uh
but who the hell are the vangors
and why the hell should i give
a rats ass about their family crest
its not an investment per se
because you probably wont see a dime
but its a chance to pull out
a piece of living history
from the sand
with your own two hands
to the aurelia
hey babe
what are you doing here
have a good dinner
bon appétit everybody
ugh
i take it youve met
so tess and i first hooked up when
we worked for this cat named moe fitch
hes kind of a local character you know
big talker lot of tall tales
a lovable old sea dog
you should live to be so eccentric
ooh
thank you babe
i do wish you would sit down
moe fitch is the most respected and
successful treasure salvor in the world
nobody said he wasnt
when finn met moe
he was repairing outboards
and lawn mowers
during the brief intervals
he wasnt getting fired
two times tess i got fired two times
ill be off in one second
moe picked him out of a puddle
of motor oil and suntan lotion
gave him a job a vocation
taught him everything he knows
almost
anyway then they had a tremendous
fallingout over this cannon we found
on our day off
from the aurelia
three miles east of vero beach
which the court ruled was moes
because we borrowed his equipment
the sea is all attached right
to what darling
kerry and vivante
grabbed a plane for the yucatân
and i thought
we could hook up with them
instead of just sailing around
doing nothing
tell us about the treasure
july 31 st 1715
a hurricane sinks the entire spanish
treasure fleet off the coast of florida
including her flagship the capitana
which according to its manifest
carried the queens dowry
forty chests
of jewelry and gold crowns
especially crafted in the orient
for the new queen of spain
when we say jewels we mean
indian diamonds burmese rubies and
colombian emeralds the size of your fist
we should probably start with what tess
and i got excited about on our honeymoon
well i think we can all guess
after we lost the court case
we decided to go backpacking in spain
for two weeks
ended up spending two years
in the archives of the indies in seville
you spent your honeymoon in a library
okay
i love you
oh baby i love you too
where every known record
official transcript and royal decree
relating to the fleets
has been kept for centuries
at first it was for fun but then
we decided to look up the aurelia
because of the cannon wed found in
florida and it became our pet project
especially when we learned the captain was
an 18yearold kid named sebastian vangor
who we also discovered
was the illegitimate son
of captain general don juan ubilla
of the capitana
and his mexican mistress
francesca vangor
we thought it was an interesting sidebar
and really didnt think much more of it
until tess found this very obscure
spanish book published in 1905
titled the vangors
an 18th century family
it was a collection of letters
so why is this important
because the vangors controlled
the mule train that transported the dowry
over the mountains
from the pacific to the caribbean
and then loaded it onto spanish galleons
here in veracruz
so im reading this and all
of a sudden i start hyperventilating
because there it is right in front of me
in ubillas last letter to francesca
he wrote
my faith in the aurelia
is that she is swift and light
and can outrun the storms
we will most certainly encounter
but it is my faith in sebastian
that knows no bounds
our son is good and strong
and wiser than this old fool
who leaves your bed
more and more reluctantly
the glory of the spanish crown
rests in his capable hands
so
ubilla pulled a switch
mm
with the vangors help
and moved the queens dowry
from the capitana to the supply ship
because
the capitana
was already way overloaded
so it was very heavy and very slow
it wasnt just hurricanes
they had to worry about
british warships
french privateers you name it
about the time finn and i were ready
to leave we found this article
about a spanish sailor
who was rescued off a deserted island
after being shipwrecked for three years
off topsail cay
right 1718
three years after the hurricane
a dutch frigate had come to grief
on the shoals off of topsail cay
and while waiting for the tide to rise
they saw what they thought
was an old man paddling out on a log
only he wasnt an old man
he was 21 years old
looked like tom hanks in that movie
what was that movie
um
cast away
haha
yes
haha
he told the dutch captain
his name was raphael serrano
of the tobacco ship francesca
ha as in mother of sebastian
yes
exactly
now he said
he had struck the same reef
and sunk in just 30 feet of water
wow
you guys must really like treasure
yes i mean its very impressive
but its still thin
oh my god
only francesca
she didnt sink off topsail cay
she sank off the coast of veracruz
in 1708
with all hands
including her captain raphael serrano
wait i dont get it
neither did we
until we discovered the francesca
had been owned by the vangor family
yeah
so what do we know
about sebastian vangor
well we know for a fact that
he survived a hurricane a shipwreck
starvation pirates most likely
and then he lied about it
now why lie about being part
of the greatest treasure fleet in history
unless youre sitting on top
of a huge secret
a secret that nobody not even
the king of spain knew existed
well i can think of only one reason
honor
because his father had entrusted him
with precious gifts
mankind had never seen
he had to survive
to fulfill the privilege
ubilla had bestowed on him
that fateful day in veracruz
thats why he lied
thats why he lived
and thats why we cant give up
sebastian vangor is the unsung hero
of an entire nation
and we intend to prove it
so what happened to him
sebastian
he was taken off the dutch ship
in martinique
and died a week later of consumption
oh
he drank too much
no um consumption darling
as in tuberculosis
not to be confused with consuming
as in guzzling
oh man im so dumb
huh you wanna hear dumb
i used to think that it meant he died
having sex as in consummating
you did
yeah
you did
yeah
really
mmhm
anyway thats our idea
its tess mostly she was always
the brains of the operation
well gemma what do you think
youre asking me
i am
a treasure hunt in the bahamas
or a month with kerry and vivante
in the yucatân
will you teach me how to dive
yes i will
tess
hey alfonz
long time
this is mr nigel honeycutt alfonz
welcome aboard
this is gemma honeycutt alfonz
pleased to meet you
like that
there you go
thank you
and whoa
okay okay
now the island is basically triangular
you got cliffs and breakers
harbor and town and beach
now i found the plate near the reef
just on the other side
but you havent got
the exact coordinates
the exact position
of the find is irrelevant
why
we uh kind of left a marker
we set the boat on fire
and then we sank it
but we would never do that to your boat
nope just my boat
our boat
my boat
our boat
my boat
hey did you know that this entire island
is owned by bigg bunny deenz
who
he owns the whole island
bigg bunny deenz
oh yes i remember
didnt he murder someone
named fuzzy dice
or pogo stick or something
his name was extac
youre really close
and he was totally acquitted
well it was difficult to secure a conviction
because he murdered all the witnesses
you are really incredible finn
okay so he owns the island so what
he doesnt own the water
and hows he gonna feel when were
hauling treasure up out of the water
in front of his beach house
supportive
i told you not to get involved with him
what if we need food or fuel
or flashlight batteries
will you relax tess
its aurelia
shes right around the corner
and shes all ours
hey guys
come look at this boat
its got these really big um tubes
going in the water off the back
is that where you found the plate
man oh man

finn
finn oh
is that all you got old man
its difficult to maintain enthusiasm
for your leadership
when you keep getting beat up
by that old man
hes 56 years old
i cant hit him
thats quite obvious
was that a yellow and white
cessna 206 seaplane
i would describe it more
as banana and cream
i still cant get over the way
he just came up out of the water like that
i know and holding the sword
and then he just makes
this totally perfect toss
and the sword ends up sticking
straight up in the deck
amazing
but its more than just the sheer power
of his raw sexuality
its a totality of his emotional commitment
to the task at hand
yeah its the focus its the focus
he sees it he wants it
he goes after it he gets it
he sure got me
do you mind
im sorry
were sorry
well
heres to a wonderfully exciting first day
and to the safe landing
of our glorious leader

you couldnt hit moe back
uh it just reminded me of how
are you in here
oh
gin
what
hundred and five
twentyeight thousand
dollars
well its all going to charity daddy
well darling im very pleased
youve inherited
not only your mothers beauty
and naïve charm
but also her singular talent for
getting huge sums of money out of me
with a modicum of effort
whats wrong
i dont want it
im sorry it was a joke
i mean be honest
she didnt exactly marry me for love
did she
my mother
was a 24yearold blackjack dealer
from nebraska
you had to tip her 500
just to have a drink with you
you got married two weeks later
at the age of 175
51 to be precise
now youre mad
because she had the brains to get
some money before you dumped her
no im mad about the amount
oh well okay you can have mine
because im cutting myself off
i dont want anything from you anymore
except for food and clothes
and rent and like travel
and im totally serious
yes thats what is so frightening
about it
gemma
for what its worth
i loved your mother and i love you
you believe in ghosts curtis
you know what
you are some kind of stupid

please tell us because i may personally
drop dead from disappointment
if i dont find out the 700millionth thing
about life on planet earth
that is bugging you
well this is fun
no listen
if i am the dutch frigate
stuck on a reef in a dead calm
in the same cove
the aurelia sank three years earlier
in less than 30 feet
of the clearest water in the world
then how come i cant see her
because she isnt there
yeah i dont know
no no no sebastian specifically said
thats where she sank
and he said it
yeah
my dear children your entire theory
is predicated on the proposition
that sebastian lied about everything he
could to prevent the ship being found
so why on earth would
he tell the truth about where she sank
i mean it seems to me that
the aurelia cant be in the cove
for the simple reason that
thats where sebastian said she was
sorry to disturb
weve had to move to the lee side
on account of the storm
she wont fit in the marina
afraid not a taxi will take you
to the beach on the north end
call well pick you up on the launch
better safe than sorry
sir
ive grown rather fond of not sinking
ugh dont even say that
oh it would be a shame
to lose the art collection
or gemmas shoes
especially because were so close
to shore you know
oh my god
what
oh my god of course
of course what
you are a genius
stefan
stefan
yes
why did you pick the north beach
i didnt its the only beach on the
island not blocked by the reef
yes yes he ran her aground
what are you so happy about
he ran her aground
what
to save the dowry sebastian ran
the whole goddamn thing aground
bet you  1000 i find something
between here and that beach
you dont have  1000
fine make it 10
you dont have  10
fine make it a million
what are you doing
you think im letting you go out
there alone youre crazy
what you dont trust me
why on earth would i trust you
huh
i found a cannon
i found a cannon
you did what
you mean theres two
theres two cannons
aah
and i owe you a million dollars aah
yes you do oh
whoo
we got the aurelia baby
listen to me if anybody finds out about
this outside of our crew we are screwed
wow cant you just enjoy this
for a second
oh im enjoying it
oh god thank god
whoohoo
well theres not much here
now they probably burned the ship
and took everything inland
look a pistol
cool
all right well what do we know
about topsail cay
we got the town the church
theres preachers cave
we were up there once
it said something about first settlers
religious freedom
god i think that is just so important
yeah but that was like
oh
like 1780something
i mean sebastian beat them here
by almost 70 years
if there are any records
theyre in the church
letters journals sermons
yeah yeah yeah
thats smart tess
its the oldest building on the island
yeah
hmm

i just figured it out its been
right in front of us this whole time
what
precious gem
yes
well do you realize how incredibly similar
the word gem is to gemma
uh i thought i did
my god
daddy you named the boat after me
and didnt even know it
i didnt
dont you see
you were running away to sea
only you wanted to bring me along
so you unconsciously
named the boat after me
that is so beautiful
of course i named it for you gemma
but it wasnt unconscious
i gave it a lot of thought
no you did it unconsciously
and then i did it unconsciously
good afternoon
afternoon may i help you
i hope so im finnegan
nice to meet you
tess
tess
dont even think about it
what
dont what me you know what
its weird right
what
this
us together
its complex but not in a good way
well can i just say
i really wish we were still married
no
oh my god listen to this
listen that we are by no means
the first europeans to visit here
is finally proven
by the discovery of a spanish gravestone
that of a woman
i cannot but wonder who she was
and how she came to die here
for the headstone reads simply
aurelia 1715
holy shit
forsake her i could not
and so it was here
on this beautiful hilltop
that i resolved to bury our own dead
and begin work building a church
he marked it with a headstone
and this guy built a church around it
its in the cemetery
its in the cemetery
finn
mmhm
oh
no come on
here we go
oh shit i got you
mmhm
anything
its not here
i refuse to believe that
well just because you refuse to
believe something doesnt make it true
or false
or whatever the hell im saying
something wrong tess
something wrong
why would anything be wrong
we just had sex in a church
and were not even married
and now were gonna dig up a grave
what is that like a triple sin
i cant believe we havent been
struck by lightning oh
ow
oh shit you okay
stupid rock
thats the second time ive done that
okay we cant have that
come here you rock stupid rock
wait stop
oh honey its heavy
so is this
finn finn
finn
what
what if its a body
well then he was a midget
with very cheap relatives
what if its a head
do you mind
oh my god
its his
to my everlasting relief
and after a years toil
in this lonely place
have i finally stumbled upon
a suitable place
for my cargo
fortified by nature
against the encroachments
accidental or deliberate
even of those who would force
our tongues to betray its trust
the low december tide showed us
the only way in and the only way out
but from january to november
the beached whales spout
is both ingress or egress
thus is the vault rendered
made virtually impenetrable
the beached whales spout
are you sure
yeah
its a blowhole
its the one at clifton point
the low december tide drops so low
the winter solstice
the lowest tide of the year
exposes the mouth of the blowhole
which is normally
under 15 to 20 feet of water
two days out of the year its a cave
they float the chests in the tide returns
then the place becomes a deathtrap
did we just find our treasure
sound like it
nice to meet you mrs finnegan
