she don t need her nerve 
10 to 1 the guy don t even show up 
  why do you say that 
  because that s his nature 
  what the hell do you know 
  that s right 
defend that bastard
and attack your friends who love you 
i ve got no feelings 
i m just saying you don t know
anything about my marriage 
  well  i heard enough 
  hmm 
do i comment on your love life 
you could  if i didn t happen to be
the most fortunate guy in the world 
get out of here 
i just want you to have the happiness
me and eddie thank god for every day 
he s not exaggerating  either 
we really do that 
apparently this makes me
some kind of deranged animal 
you make it sound
like i never meant anything to him 
all i said was the guy has a tendency
to miss a lot of appointments 
behold this dude 
what s up 
oh  my god  are you from cuba 
lucky for you we happened along 
my most superfluously toasted friend 
water  water 
it appears that you have run dry
of the sacred nectar 
oh  yeah 
yeah 
all hail neptune 
and those who party on his mighty waves 
  hail  neptune  whoo 
  hail  neptune  whoo 
decent rescue 
holy shit 
go faster  whoo 
take a left right here 
i ll give him a few more minutes 
mr  mccintry   
   but if he s not here by a quarter past   
   i ll be forced to award everything
to mrs  finnegan here   
   by default 
  i m gonna kill him 
  do you wanna go to prison 
if it gets me out of florida 
honey  florida didn t ruin your life 
you did 
you married a guy for the sex 
and then expected him to be smart 
aah 
maybe he had car trouble 
car trouble 
yeah  you know   
   car trouble 
he d have to own a car   
   which he couldn t even if he wanted to
because he has no money 
he has no credit 
he has no clue how to behave
like a responsible adult 
oh   
which is why i can t get a loan 
because everything is in our name  ha ha 
i can t even pay for school
and finish my degree   
   which is what i was doing
in the first place   
   before i got dragged down here
on spring break 
but like you said  the sex was really   
   really  really great 
do you have any idea
how humiliating it is   
   to get divorced by yourself 
your honor  this is a big mistake 
this woman   
   and i still love each other 
don t do this  tess 
look  i know i messed up  all right 
but i m willing to change in any area
that you feel needs work 
i wanna make you happy 
i ll do anything 
i ll see a counselor 
will you come to chicago with me
like you promised 
could be    i mean  that could work 
i ll definitely see the counselor 
mr  finnegan   
   i can t tell you what a pleasure it is
to inform you that under florida law   
   you and this woman have been divorced
for the last 50 or 60 seconds 
moreover  as you were not present
at the time of the proceedings   
   she got everything 
we re divorced 
i m afraid so 
why 
excuse me 
oh  wait  tess 
i gotta tell you what happened 
tess 
we found it  me and alfonz 
about a hundred yards off the reef 
right where we always said she d be 
oh   
prove it 
excuse me  excuse me 
you have a pen  paper 
anybody got a pen  pencil 
paper  anything 
your uselessness is epic 
what does that mean  here we go 
all right  alfonz and i are diving   
   and i come across this plate 
dinner plate  about yay big 
it s plain white   
   but this   
   was stamped on the back   
   in blue 
it s the vangor family crest  tess 
you were right all along 
you were right before anybody 
  where did you find this 
  a hundred yards off the reef 
wow  finn  oh  my god 
that s what i m saying 
where s the plate 
well  i don t have it on me
this minute 
where do you have it 
well  it s back there 
wow 
wow 
i know what you re thinking  tess 
but i swear to god it s the truth 
you can ask alfonz 
okay  where is he 
well  he s back there too 
i can t believe you would dangle this
in front of me 
i can t believe it 
  you really think i d lie about this 
  why not  you re a liar 
but this is an inappropriate time
to dwell on that 
you    i can draw this picture too 
hey  tess  i m telling you  we solved
a 300 year old mystery yesterday 
married or not   
   if we don t go after that ship 
it s gonna haunt us the rest of our lives 
i wasted eight years of my life
on this bullshit 
i m going back to chicago 
i m gonna get my ph  d   
   and i m going to spend the rest of my life
teaching  reading and writing books 
and somewhere in there i m gonna meet
an intelligent  successful man   
   who can get through an entire
conversation without using  definitely   
first of all 
i hardly ever say that anymore 
and when are you gonna stop selling
this crap about going back to school 
you want history 
it s under the ocean  lady 
what  are you telling me you wanna
spend your life in some dark room   
   taking notes and writing books   
   about what some old putz in
another room cooked up in his head   
   about things
that you have actually seen   
   and touched and pulled out of the sand
with your own hands 
bullshit 
i m so glad we re not married anymore 
well  where are you gonna get
the tuition money anyway 
that s the best part  by selling the boat 
by selling my boat  which belongs to me 
which used to belong to us   
   but you missed the divorce
so now it belongs to me 
i m gonna fix it up  i m gonna sell it 
and i m going back    what 
this is hard to say 
what is 
well  you act like this is totally my fault 
can i borrow this cane
for a second  please 
oh  come on  tess 
you re not gonna hit me 
ugh 
sorry 
oh  my god 
oh  my god 
oh  god 
i take it they didn t kill you 
no   
   but thanks for your help 
  you need help 
  you are not my mother 
you re right 
i guess maybe i act like your mother
sometimes because i never had one 
easy  gary  easy 
okay  look  the main thing is
we get away from key west 
the second finn lays eyes on this boat 
he s gonna be onboard in 10 minutes 
what do you mean 
you told him you re working here 
  are you kidding 
  then i don t get it 
he needs money  gary 
another boat  new equipment  everything 
and i doubt he s gonna squeeze
another dime out of that bugs bunny 
  bugs bunny 
  the rapper guy we had the fight about 
  you mean bigg bunny deenz 
  yeah 
  bigg bunny deenz is finn s investor 
  yeah 
  hey  gary 
  he is a very dangerous guy 
i did like that one song he had 
 call me thumper   
that was some funny shit 
  anyway   
  there s something wrong with my bisque 
  i m sorry  honey 
  anyway   
but i don t get it 
because has finn ever even met nigel 
no  but he will  don t you understand 
he is a genius at exactly three things 
treasure salving  finding money
for treasure salving  and one other thing 
  what other thing 
  what other thing 
i don t wanna talk about it 
how do you plan to get another boat 
i can t think about this right now  alfonz 
i just got divorced 
may i make a suggestion 
no 
you see that big yacht lying offshore 
no  which one 
the owner is nigel honeycutt 
  so what 
  i only mention it   
   because he is worth   700 million 
and just to let you know 
i m back onboard  obviously 
so whenever you want to weigh anchor
is great 
thank you 
so should i tell the captain 
ready to weigh anchor 
ready to push off 
actually  no 
my daughter  gemma  is joining us today   
   and i said i would wait here for her 
oh  great  god 
when is she coming 
where is she coming from 
how far away is she  how great 
i sent the chopper to miami   
   but she could be anywhere 
that s so funny that you would wait
in key west for her   
   when she s coming by chopper 
  is it 
  well  just because the helicopter   
   could just meet the boat anywhere 
i mean  anywhere at all  that s what s
so incredibly great about helicopters 
she wants to do some shopping 
what do you do  tess 
i m the new steward 
but what do you really do 
what makes you think i do anything
besides stewarding 
stewing  stewarding 
stewarding  stewarding 
my infallible lifelong instinct
for sizing people up 
have you sized me up 
not quite 
you don t mind the work 
but you re not here for long 
you have a deep but not entirely unclouded
love for the sea 
you perform your duties
with superlative efficiency and ease   
   suggestive of someone expending
approximately one tenth   
   of her available brain power 
so   
   what do you do
with the remaining 90 percent   
   when you re not getting divorced 
i hope i m not being too personal 
no  not at    not at all 
it s just been a crazy couple of years 
it s probably his helicopter 
his daughter
is supposed to be arriving today 
the whole town is buzzing
with excitement 
hey  so where you say
this  uh  museum is at 
number 2  water street 
okay  uh  every street on this island
is called water street 
this place has a magic atmosphere 
will you just find
the damn address  man 
yo  cordell  we got mapquest
on these things 
  hi  daddy 
  hello  darling 
hello  my baby 
daddy 
  pleasant flight 
  uh huh 
so  um  is this the whole boat 
  yes 
  oh  so cute 
i can t believe we re at sea 
well  uh  technically  we re at anchor 
oh  wait  okay  so that just means
that the anchor is in the water  right 
  yes 
  yes 
okay  because i totally wanna learn
all the sea terms 
and so you shall  my darling 
okay  let me try again 
excuse me  nigel 
yes  my dear 
you know what 
let s not do the accent thing 
it s no good 
it s fine 
um    anyway   
nigel  remember when you asked me
this afternoon what i really did 
have fun shopping 
thank you  daddy 
do try to keep it
under 50 thousand 
what  ha

i was supposed to meet some friends 
but i m gonna try to get out of it

okay  i will  love you 
my hat 
hey  look  the hat  he is a frisbee

whoa 
god 
  oh  shit

ow  ow  ow 
what in god s name happened 
daddy  this man saved my life 
sir  sir

i ve ever seen in my life 
sir  thank you so much 
thank you 
  thank you  indeed 
  he ll be okay 
just a little bump on the head 
just try not to move around too much
for the next few hours 
  but i gotta go back to town 
  oh  i really don t advise it 
oh   
now what am i gonna do 
uh   
may i suggest a hot shower 
some clean clothes   
   and cocktails at 6 30 
okay  thanks 
take him to the saint regis 
whoa  whoa 
yep  yep  yep  i m good  i m good 
hey  mr  honeycutt 
miss honeycutt 
she leave him on the boat 
gemma  your lifeline
to civilization  darling 
oh 
oh  my god  i would have been so dead 
here you are  darling 
well  mr  deenz  i m always delighted
to welcome an entrant into my field   
   whether it be on land or sea 
but i feel i need to warn you 
there s no way
of getting away from treasure   
   once it s fastened itself on your mind 
i want you to find me the queen s dowry 
heh 
  well  now  bunny  uh   
  bigg bunny  it s one word 
well  that s an emerald
of a different color  isn t it 
cordell 
this is a piece of the plate
that we found in the bahamas   
   off of topsail cay 
now  if you turn it over   
   you may notice that it has
the vangor family crest stamped on it 
that s what that is right there 
that s very nice  uh   
   but who the hell are the vangors   
   and why the hell should i give
a rat s ass about their family crest 
it s not an investment  per se 
because you probably won t see a dime   
   but it s a chance to pull out
a piece of living history   
   from the sand
with your own two hands 
to the aurelia 
hey  babe 
what are you doing here 
have a good dinner 
bon appétit  everybody 
ugh 
i take it you ve met 
so tess and i first hooked up when
we worked for this cat named moe fitch 
he s kind of a local character  you know 
big talker  lot of tall tales   
   a lovable  old sea dog 
  you should live to be so eccentric 
  ooh   
thank you  babe 
i do wish you would sit down 
moe fitch is the most respected and
successful treasure salvor in the world 
  nobody said he wasn t 
  when finn met moe   
   he was repairing outboards
and lawn mowers   
   during the brief intervals
he wasn t getting fired 
two times  tess  i got fired two times 
i ll be off in one second 
moe picked him out of a puddle
of motor oil and suntan lotion   
   gave him a job  a vocation 
taught him everything he knows 
almost 
anyway  then they had a tremendous
falling out over this cannon we found   
on our day off 
from the aurelia 
three miles east of vero beach 
which the court ruled was moe s 
because we borrowed his equipment 
the sea is all attached  right 
to what  darling 
kerry and vivante
grabbed a plane for the yucatân   
   and i thought
we could hook up with them   
   instead of just sailing around
doing nothing 
tell us about the treasure 
july 31 st  1715 
a hurricane sinks the entire spanish
treasure fleet off the coast of florida   
   including her flagship  the capitana   
   which  according to its manifest 
carried the queen s dowry 
forty chests
of jewelry and gold crowns   
   especially crafted in the orient
for the new queen of spain 
when we say jewels  we mean   
   indian diamonds  burmese rubies and
colombian emeralds the size of your fist 
we should probably start with what tess
and i got excited about on our honeymoon 
well  i think we can all guess 
after we lost the court case   
   we decided to go backpacking in spain
for two weeks 
ended up spending two years
in the archives of the indies in seville 
you spent your honeymoon in a library 
okay 
i love you 
oh  baby  i love you too 
where every known record 
official transcript and royal decree   
   relating to the fleets
has been kept for centuries 
at first it was for fun  but then
we decided to look up the aurelia   
   because of the cannon we d found in
florida  and it became our pet project 
especially when we learned the captain was
an 18 year old kid named sebastian vangor 
who we also discovered
was the illegitimate son   
   of captain general don juan ubilla
of the capitana   
   and his mexican mistress 
francesca vangor 
we thought it was an interesting sidebar
and really didn t think much more of it   
   until tess found this very obscure
spanish book published in 1905   
   titled  the vangors 
an 18th century family 
  it was a collection of letters 
  so why is this important 
because the vangors controlled
the mule train that transported the dowry   
   over the mountains
from the pacific to the caribbean   
   and then loaded it onto spanish galleons
here in veracruz 
so i m reading this  and all
of a sudden i start hyperventilating   
   because there it is right in front of me
in ubilla s last letter to francesca 
he wrote 
 my faith in the aurelia
is that she is swift and light   
   and can outrun the storms
we will most certainly encounter 
but it is my faith in sebastian
that knows no bounds 
our son is good and strong
and wiser than this old fool   
   who leaves your bed
more and more reluctantly 
the glory of the spanish crown
rests in his capable hands   
so   
   ubilla pulled a switch 
mm 
  with the vangors  help 
and moved the queen s dowry
from the capitana to the supply ship 
because 
the capitana
was already way overloaded   
   so it was very heavy and very slow 
it wasn t just hurricanes
they had to worry about 
british warships 
french privateers  you name it 
about the time finn and i were ready
to leave  we found this article   
   about a spanish sailor
who was rescued off a deserted island   
   after being shipwrecked for three years 
off topsail cay 
  right  1718 
  three years after the hurricane 
a dutch frigate had come to grief
on the shoals off of topsail cay   
   and while waiting for the tide to rise   
   they saw what they thought
was an old man paddling out on a log 
only he wasn t an old man 
he was 21 years old 
looked like tom hanks in that movie 
what was that movie 
um   
  cast away 
  ha ha 
  yes 
  ha ha 
he told the dutch captain
his name was raphael serrano   
   of the tobacco ship francesca 
ha  as in mother of sebastian 
  yes 
  exactly 
now  he said   
   he had struck the same reef
and sunk in just 30 feet of water 
wow 
you guys must really like treasure 
yes  i mean  it s very impressive   
   but it s still thin 
  oh  my god 
  only francesca   
   she didn t sink off topsail cay 
she sank off the coast of veracruz
in 1708   
   with all hands 
including her captain  raphael serrano 
  wait  i don t get it 
  neither did we 
until we discovered the francesca
had been owned by the vangor family 
yeah 
so  what do we know
about sebastian vangor 
well  we know for a fact that
he survived a hurricane  a shipwreck   
   starvation  pirates  most likely 
and then he lied about it 
now  why lie about being part
of the greatest treasure fleet in history 
unless you re sitting on top
of a huge secret 
a secret that nobody  not even
the king of spain  knew existed 
well  i can think of only one reason 
honor 
because his father had entrusted him   
   with precious gifts
mankind had never seen   
   he had to survive
to fulfill the privilege   
   ubilla had bestowed on him
that fateful day in veracruz 
that s why he lied 
that s why he lived 
and that s why we can t give up 
sebastian vangor is the unsung hero
of an entire nation   
   and we intend to prove it 
  so  what happened to him 
  sebastian 
he was taken off the dutch ship
in martinique   
   and died a week later of consumption 
  oh   
he drank too much 
no  um    consumption  darling 
as in tuberculosis 
not to be confused with consuming 
as in guzzling 
oh  man  i m so dumb 
huh  you wanna hear dumb 
i used to think that it meant he died
having sex  as in consummating 
  you did 
  yeah 
you did 
yeah 
  really 
  mm hm 
anyway  that s our idea 
it s tess  mostly  she was always
the brains of the operation 
well  gemma  what do you think 
you re asking me 
i am 
a treasure hunt in the bahamas 
or a month with kerry and vivante
in the yucatân 
will you teach me how to dive 
yes  i will 
  tess 
  hey  alfonz 
  long time 
  this is mr  nigel honeycutt  alfonz 
welcome aboard 
this is gemma honeycutt  alfonz 
pleased to meet you 
like that 
  there you go 
  thank you 
and    whoa 
okay  okay 
now  the island is basically triangular 
you got cliffs and breakers 
harbor and town  and beach 
now  i found the plate near the reef
just on the other side 
but you haven t got
the exact coordinates 
the exact position
of the find is irrelevant 
  why 
  we  uh  kind of left a marker 
we set the boat on fire 
and then we sank it 
  but we would never do that to your boat 
  nope  just my boat 
  our boat 
  my boat 
  our boat 
  my boat 
hey  did you know that this entire island
is owned by bigg bunny deenz 
  who 
  he owns the whole island 
bigg bunny deenz 
oh  yes  i remember 
didn t he murder someone
named fuzzy dice

is that all you got  old man 
it s difficult to maintain enthusiasm
for your leadership   
   when you keep getting beat up
by that old man 
he s 56 years old 
i can t hit him 
that s quite obvious 
was that a yellow and white
cessna 206 seaplane 
i would describe it more
as banana and cream 
i still can t get over the way
he just came up out of the water like that 
i know  and holding the sword 
and then he just makes
this totally perfect toss   
   and the sword ends up sticking
straight up in the deck 
amazing 
but it s more than just the sheer power
of his raw sexuality 
it s a totality of his emotional commitment
to the task at hand 
yeah  it s the focus  it s the focus 
he sees it  he wants it 
  he goes after it  he gets it 
  he sure got me 
do you mind 
  i m sorry 
  we re sorry 
well   
here s to a wonderfully exciting first day   
   and to the safe landing
of our glorious leader 
hear  says i  hear  hear  nigel

ruining the evening for the rest of us   
   and cupcakes 
are there any prostitutes

oh  my god  are you serious 
pay him no attention  gemma 
he s a provocateur 
okay  but we re not in france right now 
we re in america 
  think i m gonna head to bed 
  that s it for me tonight 
a coincidence that we got up together 
and we re both going to bed   
   because we re not going
to bed together 
  obviously 
  no 
well  it s really none of our business 
or even interesting 
  what she s trying to say   
  good night

oh  my god  all the time 
whenever i fly 
oh  penny a point 
hey  it s tess 
don t get the wrong idea 
i just  uh  wanna talk  um   
i just thought 
since i ve been kind of critical recently   
   maybe i should tell you
how magnificent you were today   
   you know  taking out their grid and   
you couldn t hit moe back 
uh  it just reminded me of how   
are you in here 
oh 
gin 
what 
hundred and five 
twenty eight thousand 
  dollars 
  well  it s all going to charity  daddy 
well  darling  i m very pleased
you ve inherited   
   not only your mother s beauty
and na ï ve charm   
   but also her singular talent for
getting huge sums of money out of me   
   with a modicum of effort 
what s wrong 
i don t want it 
i m sorry  it was a joke 
i mean  be honest   
   she didn t exactly marry me for love 
did she 
my mother   
   was a 24 year old blackjack dealer
from nebraska 
you had to tip her  500
just to have a drink with you 
you got married two weeks later
at the age of 175 
  51 to be precise 
  now you re mad   
   because she had the brains to get
some money before you dumped her 
no  i m mad about the amount 
oh  well  okay  you can have mine 
because i m cutting myself off 
i don t want anything from you anymore 
except for food  and clothes 
and rent and  like  travel 
and i m totally serious 
yes  that s what is so frightening
about it 
gemma 
for what it s worth   
   i loved your mother  and i love you 
you believe in ghosts  curtis 
you know what 
you are some kind of stupid 
now you sound like my wife 
bunny around

than when i came in here 
  can i get a word in 
  what  what do you want 
i wanna buy some time 
you still breathing  ain t you 
yeah  thank you 
now  hear me out 
all right  the way i see it  you bet

   but you bet on the both of us  and we
cover twice the ground in half the time   
   and i m willing to give you 10 percent
of everything i find 
plus what i already owe you  of course 
how much you say 
ten percent  across the board 
ten percent  huh 
wow 
  say it again 
  come on  what    
you know  12 percent s cool 
you know  i couldn t even hear you 
what you say 
  fifteen percent  but i gotta find   
  i m sorry  how much 
  eighteen  but i owe other people 
  that don t sound right 
  twenty percent  but that s it  final 
  oh 
damn it  what  how much do you want 
i ll tell you what 
you find the treasure and i won t kill you 
  how much do you owe him 
  whoa 
jesus  tess

bigg bunny 
i don t owe him any money 
finn  how much do you owe him 
just tell me so i ll know 
oh  god  tess  i mean  that s so hard
to be specific about 
  it s a really complex payment schedule   
  how much 
sixty two thousand  five hundred and
eighty one dollars and forty three cents 
but we re good now 
is there a reason
you didn t tell me this before 
yeah 
you wouldn t have come 
yeah  i would 
just wouldn t have come with you 
are we finished 
we sure are 
  you good 
  yeah 
okay 
what happened to your face 
somebody hit me with a cricket bat 
ah 
  this is a new type of regulator   
  shove it up your ass 
  all right  we re good to go 
  ready  darling 
drop dead 
this is just like the old days  huh 
hello  darling 
drink 
i have one 
you know what else
is really bugging me 
no 
please  tell us  because i may personally
drop dead from disappointment   
   if i don t find out the 700 millionth thing
about life on planet earth   
   that is bugging you 
well  this is fun 
no  listen 
if i am the dutch frigate
stuck on a reef in a dead calm   
   in the same cove
the aurelia sank three years earlier   
   in less than 30 feet
of the clearest water in the world   
then how come i can t see her 
because she isn t there 
yeah  i don t know 
no  no  no  sebastian specifically said
that s where she sank 
  and he said it 
  yeah 
my dear children  your entire theory
is predicated on the proposition   
   that sebastian lied about everything he
could to prevent the ship being found 
so why on earth would
he tell the truth about where she sank 
i mean  it seems to me that
the aurelia can t be in the cove   
   for the simple reason that
that s where sebastian said she was 
sorry to disturb 
we ve had to move to the lee side
on account of the storm 
she won t fit in the marina 
afraid not  a taxi will take you
to the beach on the north end 
  call  we ll pick you up on the launch 
  better safe than sorry 
sir 
i ve grown rather fond of not sinking 
ugh  don t even say that 
oh  it would be a shame
to lose the art collection 
or gemma s shoes 
especially because we re so close
to shore  you know 
oh  my god 
what 
oh  my god  of course 
of course what 
you are a genius 
stefan 
  stefan 
  yes 
why did you pick the north beach 
i didn t  it s the only beach on the
island not blocked by the reef 
yes  yes  he ran her aground 
what are you so happy about 
  he ran her aground 
  what 
to save the dowry  sebastian ran
the whole goddamn thing aground 
bet you   1000 i find something
between here and that beach 
you don t have   1000 
fine  make it 10 
you don t have   10 
fine  make it a million 
what are you doing 
you think i m letting you go out
there alone  you re crazy 
what  you don t trust me 
why on earth would i trust you 
huh 
  i found a cannon 
  i found a cannon 
  you did what 
  you mean there s two 
  there s two cannons 
  aah 
  and i owe you a million dollars  aah 
  yes  you do  oh 
whoo 
we got the aurelia  baby 
listen to me  if anybody finds out about
this outside of our crew  we are screwed 
wow  can t you just enjoy this
for a second 
oh  i m enjoying it 
oh  god  thank god 
whoo hoo 
well  there s not much here 
now  they probably burned the ship
and took everything inland 
look  a pistol 
cool 
all right  well  what do we know
about topsail cay 
we got the town  the church   
there s preacher s cave 
we were up there once 
it said something about first settlers   
   religious freedom   
god  i think that is just so important 
yeah  but that was like   
  oh 
  like 1780 something 
i mean  sebastian beat them here
by almost 70 years 
if there are any records 
they re in the church 
  letters  journals  sermons 
  yeah  yeah  yeah 
that s smart  tess 
it s the oldest building on the island 
  yeah 
  hmm 
when moe finds out we re gone   
   he s gonna come barreling up
your ass like a freight train 
oh  my  that ought to be interesting 
well  i m just saying
we don t have much time 
oh  my god 
stop the boat 
i just figured it out  it s been
right in front of us this whole time 
what 
precious gem 
yes 
well  do you realize how incredibly similar
the word  gem  is to  gemma  
uh    i thought i did 
my god 
daddy  you named the boat after me
and didn t even know it 
i didn t 
don t you see 
you were running away to sea 
only you wanted to bring me along 
so you unconsciously
named the boat after me 
that is so beautiful 
of course i named it for you  gemma 
but it wasn t unconscious 
i gave it a lot of thought 
no  you did it unconsciously 
and then i did it unconsciously 
good afternoon 
afternoon  may i help you 
  i hope so  i m finnegan 
  nice to meet you 
  tess 
  tess 
don t even think about it 
  what 
  don t  what  me  you know what 
it s weird  right 
  what 
  this 
us  together 
it s complex  but not in a good way 
well  can i just say
i really wish we were still married 
no 
oh  my god  listen to this 
listen   that we are by no means   
   the first europeans to visit here   
   is finally proven
by the discovery of a spanish gravestone   
   that of a woman 
i cannot but wonder who she was   
   and how she came to die here 
for the headstone reads simply   
    aurelia  1715   
holy shit 
 forsake her i could not 
and so it was here 
on this beautiful hilltop   
   that i resolved to bury our own dead   
   and begin work building a church   
he marked it with a headstone 
and this guy built a church around it 
  it s in the cemetery 
  it s in the cemetery 
  finn 
  mm hm 
oh   
  no  come on 
  here we go 
oh  shit  i got you 
mm hm 
anything 
it s not here 
i refuse to believe that 
well  just because you refuse to
believe something doesn t make it true 
or false 
or whatever the hell i m saying 
something wrong  tess 
something wrong 
why would anything be wrong 
we just had sex in a church
and we re not even married   
   and now we re gonna dig up a grave 
what is that  like a triple sin 
i can t believe we haven t been
struck by lightning  oh 
  ow 
  oh  shit  you okay 
stupid rock 
that s the second time i ve done that 
okay  we can t have that 
come here  you rock  stupid rock 
wait  stop

so is this 
finn  finn 
finn 
  what 
  what if it s a body 
well  then he was a midget
with very cheap relatives 
  what if it s a head 
  do you mind 
oh  my god 
it s his 
 to my everlasting relief   
   and after a year s toil
in this lonely place   
   have i finally stumbled upon
a suitable place   
   for my cargo   
   fortified by nature
against the encroachments   
   accidental or deliberate   
   even of those who would force
our tongues to betray its trust 
the low december tide showed us
the only way in and the only way out 
but from january to november   
   the beached whale s spout
is both ingress or egress 
thus is the vault rendered 
made virtually impenetrable   
the beached whale s spout 
are you sure 
yeah 
it s a blowhole 
it s the one at clifton point 
  the low december tide drops so low   
  the winter solstice 
the lowest tide of the year
exposes the mouth of the blowhole   
   which is normally
under 15 to 20 feet of water 
two days out of the year it s a cave 
they float the chests in  the tide returns   
   then the place becomes a deathtrap 
did we just find our treasure 
sound like it
