they re in the overhead rack 
commander bond

  thank goodness you re here  james 
  that s very nice  moneypenny 
a little over the top for the office 
i ve been trying to reach you all morning 
what have you been up to 
rest and recreation  my darling 
the trip back from siberia
took a lot out of me 
your dedication when you re on the job
is most commendable  james 
omit the customary pleasantries  miss
moneypenny  we re pressed for time 
i ll fill you in later  moneypenny 
  minister 
  commander 
good morning  sir 
a new pet  q 
if  007  you d ever bothered to read
any memos sent from my department 
you would realise this is a prototype
of a sophisticated surveillance machine 
now we re all here
you can get on with the briefing  q 
very good  sir 
gentlemen   
a silicon integrated circuit 
the essential part
of all modern computers 
no lecture  q 
we re all aware of the microchip 
until recently  all microchips
were susceptible to damage
from the intense magnetic pulse
of a nuclear explosion 
  magnetic pulse 
  yes  minister 
one burst in outer space over the uk
and everything with a microchip in it 
from the modern toaster to sophisticated
computers and our defence systems 
would be rendered useless 
we d be paralysed  
at the russians  mercy 
that is why a private defence
contractor came up with this 
a chip totally impervious
to magnetic pulse damage 
now   if i place it on the micro comparator
and compare it with
the chip bond recovered
from the body of 003 in siberia   
  when i bring the two images together   
  they re identical 
the kgb must have a pipeline
into that research company 
it would appear so 
six months ago that company was
acquired by an anglo french combine 
zorin lndustries 
there has been a security
check of the plant 
a very extensive one 
but we have no leads 
what about zorin himself 
max zorin  lmpossible 
he s a leading french industrialist 
a staunch anti communist with
influential friends in the government 
with due respect  minister 
the leak did occur
after zorin bought the company 
precisely why
i ve initiated an investigation 
all right  but let s be discreet about it 
but of course  minister 
you have exactly 35 minutes
to get properly dressed  007 
they round the turn 
just under a mile to race from this point 
come on  fluke  move your ar   
  who is number one  the grey with him 
  oh  that s pegasus  zorin s horse 
with the cane  max zorin 
yes  born in dresden 
fled from east germany in the sixties 
french passport 
speaks at least five languages  no accent 
now the talk of the city and the bourse 
  the old rags to riches story 
  made his first fortune in oil and gas 
now a second in electronics and hi tech 
who s that with him under the hat 
with the red dress  a girlfriend 
we re not sure about her 
american  she s never far from him 
name s may day 
and dressed for the occasion 
come on  fluke  get a wiggle on 
pegasus has come from nowhere 
and as they go for the line
it s pegasus who storms clear
off fluke and cooper girl 
first  number one  second  number two 
and third  number five 
first number one  pegasus 
second number two  fluke 
and third number five  cooper girl 
unbelievable  ln all my years as a trainer
i ve never seen a horse
run such a fast last furlong 
sir godfrey tibbett  our department 
  many congratulations 
  thank you 
  lucky man  zorin 
  could be more than luck  admiral 
  fixed 
  your guess is as good as mine 
the french jockey club have hired
a detective  aubergine  to look into it 
easy  pegasus 
calm down  pegasus 
steady 
she must take a lot of vitamins 
perhaps pegasus does too 
i think i should meet with
this detective friend of yours 
yes  might have some interesting
information for us  set it up  tibbett 
right you are 
moneypenny   be a darling  would you 
and collect that for me 
  i ll buy you dinner when we get back 
  pegasus 
bollinger   75 
i see you are a connoisseur 
monsieur bond 
  ensuite  lafite rothschild  59 
  another excellent choice 
i m pleased you approve  
since you re paying the bill 
  cheers 
  santé  monsieur aubergine 
the sûreté has no information on zorin
before he came over from east germany 
through a personal connection
i saw his dossier myself 
but even sûreté records
are sometimes incomplete 
et voici maintenant the fabulous
dominique and the enchanted papillons 
perhaps we should add this
butterfly to our collection  no 
tell me  why do zorin s horses
beat others with superior bloodlines 
this is a mystery 
  could he be using drugs 
  nothing showed up in the tests 
later this month  zorin will hold his
annual sales at his stud near paris 
security is formidable
but the key to this mystery is there 
and l  achille aubergine 
intend to find it 
  qu est ce qu il y a 
  there s a fly in his soup 
  follow that parachute 
  crazy english 
out 
my car 
my car 
congratulations 
so 
this operation was to be
conducted discreetly 
it took six million francs
in damages and penalties
for violating most of the napoleonic code 
under the circumstances it was
more important to identify the assassin 
what did you learn from aubergine
before his demise 
only that zorin is having a thoroughbred
sale at his stud not far from here 
i should be there 
  can you help me  sir godfrey 
  i may be able to arrange an invitation 
it s a bit short notice   
but i might just be able to squeeze you in 
thank you 
sir godfrey  your hat 
mr saint john smith

thank you 
steady  steady  pegasus 
keep him on a tight rein

we are now very proud to present

  sorry  sir 
mr faras told his trainer
he ll go to a million for the lthacus colt 
  good  anything from st john smythe 
  nothing about the sale  sir 
  but i d hate to be his valet 
  you ll have to buck up your ideas 
  i m sorry  sir 
  don t be so damned obsequious 
oh  my lord 
what the devil s wrong with these shoes 
  were they wiped over with an oily rag 
  terribly sorry  sir 
you blasted well should be 
i don t know how long
you expect to remain in my employ   
  well done  my good man 
  must we keep this up when we re alone 
a successful cover becomes
almost second nature 
what s all this about
pegasus disappearing 
one minute he s in his stall  
the next  neither hide nor hair of him 
we should look into it 
well  don t you concern yourself with that 
there s the man i saw
at the pegasus stable
  another wealthy owner 
  who knows 
  but she d bear closer inspection 
  we re on a mission 
sir godfrey  on a mission
i am expected to sacrifice myself 
lovely party 
enjoying our little party 
monsieur    saint john smythe 
immensely  st john smythe 
looks as though you ll have
a good turnout for the sale tomorrow 
may i introduce miss sutton 
sheikh farouk 
  welcome 
  mr zorin  main strike all set 
we ll know after the 22nd 
  thank you 
  enjoy yourself 
you were looking for something 
yes  l    was looking for the bar 
come  i will show you 
oh  by the way  the name is
st john smythe  james st john smythe 
dr carl mortner  at your service 
  hiya  doc 
  good afternoon  mr conley 
mr conley  mr smythe 
bob conley 
  are you a trainer 
  horses  hell  i can t even ride 
  i m in the oil business 
  oh  texas 
frisco  i handle mr zorin s
oil interests there 
would you excuse us  come on  honey 
are you a doctor of medicine 
oh  no  no 
i am mr zorin s breeding consultant 
oh  really 
then you can let me into a little secret 
how is it you succeed with breeding
bloodlines other experts think inferior 
selective breeding is important 
but more important
is conditioning and a desire  ja 
are you talking about people or horses 
my principles apply equally
to human beings 
mr st john smythe 
allow me to introduce myself 
mr zorin  it s a great pleasure 
  a groom asked if you d go to the stables 
  of course 
you will excuse me 
i must congratulate you  mr zorin 
your stables are magnificent 
built in the 16th century by a duke who
believed he d be reincarnated as a horse 
have thoroughbreds interested you long 
oh  no  as a matter of fact i had a dotty
old aunt die and leave me some stables 
so i thought it might be rather fun
to breed and raise horses 
  i take it you ride 
  i m happiest in the saddle 
a fellow sportsman 
what about fishing 
fly casting 
i m neglecting my other guests  you ll find
the young ladies stimulating company 
i m sure they are 
hello  i thought you might
like to join the party 
by the way  the name is
james st john smythe  i m english 
  i never would have guessed 
  really 
well  are you buying or selling 
  selling  
  horses 
no  i m not interested in horses 
well  you came to the wrong place 
didn t you 
may day 
get her away from him 
i m sure i ve seen him somewhere before 
have security keep a good eye on him 
you didn t say what part
of the states you come from  miss   
no  i didn t 
i suppose you travel a lot 
your helicopter leaves in 20 minutes 
you re not staying the night  i was hoping
we d spend the evening together 
now i shall be all alone 
i doubt that 
  well  let me walk you to the chopper 
  that won t be necessary 
  someone will take care of you 
  you ll see to that personally  will you 
are you looking for this 
quite a letdown 
  st john smythe 
  sleeping like a baby 
that s a boy  there we are 
it s interesting  he s had surgery 
surgery  that is how zorin won the race 
mortner implanted one of
these microchips into pegasus 
you see  these microchips are
programmed to control an injection
of additional natural horse steroids 
  to overcome fatigue during the race 
  how 
the injection itself 
with that small needle 
is triggered by
a remote control transmitter
small enough to fit into
the tip of a jockey s whip  
or a cane 
the lights 
there s a world surplus of microchips
and zorin is hoarding them 
  i m afraid i wasn t much help 
  don t worry  it s all wrapped up 
keep your guard up higher 
and retain your balance 
  what now 
  we d better get back 
the tape ran out five minutes ago 
i told you not to disturb us 
it s important 
there s been intruders in the warehouse 
put security on full alert 
let s see where mr st john smythe is 
he was the man at the eiffel tower 
  we must find him 
  i ll get dressed 
may day  where have you been 
i ve been waiting for you 
to take care of me personally 
i see you re a woman of very few words 
what s there to say 
  is everything here 
  ja  ja 
except this 
it is in the wrong place 
bring st john smythe to my study
first thing in the morning 
good morning 
i understand you wish to see me 
  you slept well 
  a little restless  but i got off eventually 
i have the progeny lndex
on the computer 
a compilation of thoroughbred bloodlines 
might be helpful to you in selecting
your purchase this afternoon 
as i see it  you need a stallion 
for breeding 
a stallion sounds right to me 
i find a computer indispensable 
i have a stallion 
descended from that horse there 
misty 
we have several horses
that might interest you 
splendid 
would you be interested
primarily in stamina 
  or speed 
  well  a little of both would be ideal 
i think i have just the horse for you 
it s time for my morning ride 
  why don t you try him out 
  that sounds a very good idea 
  i shall get into some riding clothes 
  good 
half an hour  then 
scarpine will collect you 
thank you 
tibbett  get into town  call m
and ask him to put a trace on this cheque 
be quick  if those guards we laid out
identify us we ll have to move fast 
what shall i say
if they ask where i m going 
just tell them
you have to get the car washed 
just going to town to get the car washed 
  your mount  mr st john smythe 
  a beautiful beast 
a little spirited  what s his name 
inferno 
  friends of yours 
  exercise boys 
jumping together
is more realistic training 
frankly  i prefer cross country
to steeplechase 
as one sportsman to another 
i ll make you a proposition 
you can have that lthacus colt gratis
if you stay this course 
  and if i m thrown 
  then you lose 
you leave me little choice 
splendid  scarpine will start us 
steady 
keep going 
sir godfrey  let s get   
you lost  007 
  killing tibbett was a mistake 
  i m about to make the same one twice 
my department know i m here 
they ll retaliate 
if you re the best they have 
they ll more likely try
to cover up your incompetence 
don t count on it  zorin 
  you amuse me  mr bond 
  well  it s not mutual 
other side 
open up 
  good morning  comrade zorin 
  general gogol 
  this meeting is ill advised 
  a calculated risk 
but necessary 
as you refuse to answer your control 
come to the point  general 
you disregard procedure 
you did not request approval
before eliminating 007 
  reprisals might jeopardise operations 
  you jeopardise mine 
letting the british penetrate
the siberian research centre 
that was regrettable 
your racing activities
attract unnecessary attention 
but more disturbing are your
unauthorised commercial ventures 
we cannot tolerate that 
the issue is irrelevant 
i ve made new associations 
i no longer consider myself a kgb agent 
we trained you  financed you 
what would you be without us 
a biological experiment  a freak 
enough of this  control yourselves 
you will come back to us  comrade 
no one ever leaves the kgb 
gentlemen 
for centuries alchemists
tried to make gold from base metals 
today we make microchips from silicon 
which is common sand 
but far better than gold 
for several years we ve had
a profitable partnership 
you as manufacturers  while i passed on
to you industrial information
that made you competitive  successful 
we are now in the unique position
to form an international cartel
to control not only production
but distribution of these microchips 
there is one obstacle 
silicon valley 
near san francisco 
over 250 plants employing
thousands of scientists  technicians 
this is the heartland of electronic
production in the united states 
which accounts for what  
80  of the world microchip market 
i propose to end
the domination of silicon valley 
  and to leave us in control of that market 
  what is it you propose 
project main strike 
for which  each of you will pay me
one hundred million dollars 
a hundred million dollars  
plus half our net income 
under an exclusive
marketing agreement with me 
these are outrageous terms 
perhaps a demonstration
would convince you 
  i want no part of it  thank you 
  as you wish 
the rest of our discussion
must of course be confidential 
  would you wait outside 
  if you d like me to  yes  excuse me 
may day will provide you with a drink 
this way 
so  does anybody else want to drop out 
wow 
what a view 
to a kill 
five dollars 
thank you 
  looking for something special 
  yes  soft shell crabs 
might have some in the back 
i ll be a few minutes 
chuck lee  cia 
it s a pleasure working with 007 
  thanks  now what about zorin 
  he s in town  i can have him tailed 
no  not yet 
conley is a geologist  runs zorin s
oil reclamation project in the east bay 
last job  chief engineer
in a south african gold mine 
left in a hurry
after a cave in killed 20 miners 
zorin s kind of man 
what about the girl  and the cheque 
you know how many s suttons
there are in the us 
we watch zorin s account 
the cheque hasn t been cashed 
  mortner 
  got a real winner here
