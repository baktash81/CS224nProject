you can sugarcoat it
the way they do in movies
and romance novels
where beautiful people
learn beautiful lessons
where nothing is too messed
up that cant be fixed
with an apology
and a peter gabriel song
i like that version as much
as the next girl does
believe me
its just not the truth
this is the truth
sorry
late in the winter
of my seventeenth year
my mother decided
that i was depressed
she just eats like a bird
she barely leaves the house
i am not depressed mom
shes reading the same
book over and over
shes depressed
im not depressed
the booklets and the websites
always list depression as
a side effect of cancer
depressions not
a side effect of cancer
its a side effect of dying
which is what was happening to me
i may switch you to zoloft
or lexapro
and twice a day instead of once
why stop there
hmm
really just keep them coming
im like the keith richards
of cancer kids
have you been going to that
support group i suggested
yeah its not my thing
support groups can be a great way
for you to connect
with people who are
who are what
on the same journey
journey really
give it a chance
who knows you might even
find it enlightening
all right
are you guys ready
we are gathered here today
literally in the heart of jesus
were here with jc
who wants to share their
story with the group
im angel
i have acute myeloid leukemia
sid acute lymphoblastic leukemia
hi im pj um
i have neuroblastoma
im patrick
testicular
ill spare you the gory details
of patricks ball cancer
basically they found it
in his nuts
they cut most of it out and he
almost died but he didnt die
so now here he is
divorced friendless
living on his parents couch
exploiting his cancertastic
past in the heart of jesus
literally
to show us that one day
if were lucky
we could be just like him
whos next
hazel
um
im hazel
uh thyroid originally
but now with quite the impressive
satellite colony in my lungs
and how are you doing

christ
hey sweet pea
so was it awesome
yeah mom it was awesome
and that was my life
reality shows
doctors appointments
eight prescription drugs
three times a day
but worst worst worst of all
support group
you cannot make me
of course we can
were your parents
come on weve been through this
you need to go
you need to make friends
and be a teenager
mom if you want me
to be a teenager
you dont send me to support group
you gotta get me a fake id
so that i can go to clubs
and drink gimlets and take pot
uh you dont take pot
well that is the kind of thing
i would know with a fake id
can you just get in the car please
and so i went
not because i wanted to or because
i thought it would help me
but for the same reason
i did anything these days
to make my parents happy
i really dont understand
why i cant just drive myself
its not like youre
gonna do anything
youre just gonna sit here
and wait again
of course im not
no ive got stuff to do
im gonna do errands
yeah
i love you
i love you too
have fun
the only thing worse than
biting it from cancer
is having a kid
bite it from cancer
hey
make some friends
oh sorry
ill take the stairs
no problem
thank you
sorry
my bad
im sorry
oh my god
so who would like to start
does anyone want to start
who wants to kick it off

spindle cell sarcoma

isaac i know that youre facing
some challenges right now
do you want to share
with the group
or maybe your friend here
no ill share
hey guys uh
hi im isaac
i have retinoblastoma
we had surgery on one eye
when i was younger
so this is a glass eye
and then im going in to the
hospital to have another surgery
to take out the other eye
so after that surgery im
just gonna be totally blind

augustus waters to help me out
so thats whats up thanks
were here for you isaac
thank you

cyborg which is awesome
but really im just

im grand yeah
im on a roller coaster that
only goes up my friend
maybe youd like to share
your fears with the group
my fears
oblivion
oblivion
yeah
you see i intend to live
an extraordinary life
to be remembered
so id say if i have any fears
it would be to not do that
would anyone else in the
group like to speak to that
hazel
unexpected
i just want to say
that theres gonna
come a time when
all of us are dead
there was a time before humans
and theres gonna be a time after
it could be tomorrow it could
be a million years from now
and when it does
there will be no one left
to remember cleopatra or
muhammad ali or mozart
let alone any of us
oblivions inevitable
and if that scares you then
i suggest you ignore it
god knows its what
everyone else does
well thats some good advice
and i like all this because its
really nice to hear everybody
thank you
mmmhmm
always
always
always
always
literally
i thought we were
in a church basement
but apparently we were literally
in the heart of jesus
oh yeah
whats your name
hazel
no whats your full name
hazel grace lancaster
what
i didnt say anything
why are you looking
at me like that
because youre beautiful
oh my god
i enjoy looking
at beautiful people
see i decided a while back
not to deny myself the simpler
pleasures of existence
particularly as you
so astutely pointed out
were all gonna die pretty soon
okay well thats great
but i am not beautiful
hey gus
hi lisa
i like it when you say it first
i like it when you say it first
okay
always
always
what is with the always
always is like their thing
theyll always love
each other and whatnot
they probably texted always to each
other 14 million times this year
hes got to be hurting her boob
lets go watch a movie
what
hmm
huh
um
im free later this week
we could
no i mean now
you could be an axe murderer
theres always that possibility
come on hazel grace
take a risk
i dont
really
that is disgusting
what
what do you think that
thats cool or something
you just ruined this whole thing
the whole thing
yes this whole thing
oh man
ugh and you were
doing really well too
god theres always
a hamartia isnt there
and yours is even though
you had freaking cancer
youre willing to give
money to a corporation
for the chance to acquire
even more cancer
let me just tell you that not
being able to breathe sucks
it totally sucks
hamartia
its a fatal flaw
ah a fatal
hazel grace
they dont actually hurt
you unless you light them
hmm
ive never lit one
its a metaphor see
you put the thing that does the
killing right between your teeth
but you never give it
the power to kill you
a metaphor
hey sweetheart
is it top model time
no uh
ive made plans
with augustus waters
whoa
oh my god
ooh
yeah i failed my test
a couple times
you dont say
actually the fourth time
i took the test
it was going about
how this is going
and when it was over
the instructor looks over
at me and she says
your driving while unpleasant
is not technically unsafe
cancer perk
total cancer perk
so tell me about you
um i was 13 when they found it
pretty much worstcase scenario
thyroid stage four
not much they could do
which didnt stop them of course
surgery
radiation
chemo
more radiation
all of which worked for a while
but then stopped working
and then one day my lungs
started filling up with water
nurse we need a nurse right now
i couldnt breathe
no one could get it under control
you can let go sweetie
dont be afraid
that should have been the end
oh my god
but then something
strange happened
the antibiotics kicked in
they drained the fluid
from my lungs
i got some strength back
next thing i know i found
myself in an experimental trial
you know the ones that are famous
in the republic of
cancervania for not working
its called phalanxifor
it didnt work in over
70 of the patients
but for some reason
its been working for me
so they called it
the miracle
of course my lungs still
suck at being lungs
but theoretically they could
continue to suck like this
for i dont know a while maybe
so are you back in school
i got my ged so im
taking classes at mcc
whoa a college girl
well that explains
the aura of sophistication
oh careful
oops
welcome to my humble abode

its like to be dying
but b hasnt actually died
okay
i will read this horrible book
with this very boring title
that does not include
zombies or stormtroopers
and in exchange
you will read this
this haunting
yet brilliant novelization
of my favorite video game
counterinsurgence
yeah dont laugh its awesome
its about honor and sacrifice
and bravery and heroism
its about embracing your destiny
and leaving a mark on the world
well thank you
wait your hands are so cold

as just underoxygenated
hazel grace
hmm
i love it when you

its a mothers dream
hey dont worry
oh my god mom

uhhuh very good
theyre good right
mmmhmm
so do they eat a lot of goji
berries on goji berry day

an amazing antioxidant
well i like it
we should do it every year
every year
we should do it every year
i know
i really do like these
honey would you like
to be excused
what
hazel grace
welcome to the sweet torture of
reading an imperial affliction
but now im breaking all the rules
are you okay
and now im breaking all the rules
uh me yeah
i am excellent
i am however with isaac and
isaac does support group hazel
make this better or worse
ive been wasting all my time
isaac focus on me
been wasting all my time
how fast can you get here
um
great well
the doors open
i gotta run bye
hello
hazel
isaac hazel grace from the
support group is here
hi
hi
uh a gentle reminder
isaacs in the midst of a
psychotic episode right now
you look really nice by the way
i like this color on you
thank you
isaac
isaac hazels here
hey isaac
hey hazel
how you doing
im doing okay
it seems isaac and monica are
no longer a going concern
oh isaac im so sorry
do you want to talk about it
no i just want to cry
and play video games
however you know it doesnt
hurt to talk to him
if you have any sage words
of feminine advice
i actually think that his
response is fairly appropriate
pain demands to be felt
youre quoting my book
she said she wanted to break up
with me before the surgery
because she couldnt handle it
im about to lose my eyesight
and she cant handle it
i kept saying always to her
like always
and she kept talking over me
and not saying it back and
it was like i was gone
already you know
you know sometimes
people dont understand
the promises
that theyre making
when they make them
i know but
i feel like such a loser
i still have her necklace on
take it off
dude take that off
yeah
here we go man
here we go
i just want to kick something
dont hit that dont hit that
uh
hit this
sorry
ive been wanting to call
you for a few days now
but ive been waiting
until i could form
a coherent thought about
an imperial affliction
one second
isaac
pillows dont break
you need to break something
try this
the trophy
yeah
are you sure
ive been looking for a way to tell
my father i kind of hate basketball
go to town
always
an imperial affliction
yes im so glad that you liked it
yes i did
but the ending
i know
it is rather abrupt
rather abrupt are you kidding
its evil
i mean i understand
that she dies
but theres an unwritten
contract between author and
gus
yeah
cool
sure
between author and reader
and i feel like ending your book
in the middle of a sentence
violates that contract
dont you think
okay yes
i know what you mean
but to be completely honest
i think its just so truthful
you just die in the middle of life
you die in the middle
of a sentence
and i dont know
but i really would like to know
what happens to everyone
after anna dies
like annas mother
yes and the dutch tulip man
and sisyphus the hamster
yes
have you tried contacting
this peter van houten fellow
ive written him so many letters
but hes never responded
apparently he moved to amsterdam
and became a recluse and
shame
yeah
isaac
you feeling better buddy
thats the thing about pain
it demands to be felt
ill help you clean this up
hazel grace
augustus waters
i cannot stop thinking
about this goddamn book
youre welcome
however we do need closure
dont you think
that is exactly what i was asking
van houten for in my letters
but he never responded
um nope
dear mr waters
i am writing to thank you for
your electronic correspondence
i am grateful to anyone
who sets aside the time
to read my book
augustus
yes
what are you doing
i may have found
van houtens assistant
emailed her
augustus
she may have forwarded
that email on to van houten
shall i continue
oh my god yeah go go go
i am particularly
indebted to you sir
hazel grace
he just called me sir
augustus keep reading
keep reading
both for your kind words about
an imperial affliction
and for taking the time
to tell me that the book and
here i quote you directly
meant a great deal to you
and your friend hazel grace
you did not you did not
you did not you did not
of course i did
to answer your question no i have
not written anything else nor will i
i do not feel like continuing to
share my thoughts with readers
would benefit either them or me
however thank you
for your generous email
yours most sincerely
peter van houten
so yeah that just happened
oh my god
ive been trying to tell
you im kind of awesome
do you think that i
check your inbox
oh my god
oh my god augustus
im freaking out im freaking out
dear mr peter van houten
my name is hazel grace lancaster
my friend augustus waters
who read your book
at my recommendation
just received an email
from you at this address
i hope you will not mind that
he shared that email with me
i was wondering if you wouldnt mind
answering a few questions i have
about what happens
after the end of the book
specifically the following
does annas mom marry
the dutch tulip man
and is the dutch tulip man
up to something
or is he just
completely misunderstood
lastly i was hoping you could shed
some light on sisyphus the hamster
these questions have
haunted me for years
and i dont know how long i have
left to get answers to them
i know that these are not
important literary questions
and that your book is full of
important literary questions
but i would just
really like to know
and of course if you ever do
decide to write anything else
i would love to read it
frankly id read
your grocery lists
yours with great admiration
hazel grace lancaster
not bad
you think
yeah i mean
its a bit pretentious
but then again van houten
uses words like tendentious
and bacchanalia so
i think hell like it
is it really 100 am
is it
yeah i guess it is
i should probably go to sleep
okay
okay
okay
okay
perhaps okay
will be our always
okay
oh my god
dear ms lancaster
i cannot answer your questions
at least not in writing
because to do so
would constitute a sequel
which you might publish or
otherwise share on the internet
not that i dont trust you
but how could i trust you
i barely know you
should ever you find
yourself in amsterdam
do pay a visit at your leisure
what
yours most sincerely
peter van houten
oh my god
what is this life
hazel
mom
hazel whats wrong
mom look at this
come here come here come here
look
what
yeah
peter van houten
look what he said
should ever you find
yourself in amsterdam
i have to go
thats incredible
he invited us to amsterdam
amsterdam
wow
can we go
i mean do you think
we could actually go
i mean amsterdam
i want you to have everything
you want in the world
but we dont have
the money you know
just getting all the
equipment over there
how do we do that
yeah duh im sorry
hey you i am so sorry
its okay
why dont you just ask
the genies use your wish
i already used it
premiracle
whatd you use it on
not disney
hazel grace you did not
go to disney world
you did not use your last dying wish
i was 13
to go to disney world
and epcot center
oh my god
it was actually a really fun trip
thats the saddest thing
ive ever heard
i met goofy
now im just embarrassed
why are you embarrassed
i cant believe i have a crush on
a girl with such cliche wishes
terrible
you coming
the most important
thing in any mri
is to lie completely still
but that day
it was almost impossible
hey gus how are you
hi mrs lancaster
hey rik smits jersey
yeah it is indeed
i loved that guy
im augustus waters
nice to meet you
im michael
its good to see you
hi mrs lancaster
good to see you
hi hazel grace
hi
how would you like to go
on a picnic with me
um i would love to go
on a picnic with you
shall we
no let me
i smell like hospital
so i should just change
so uh
youre a survivor yourself huh
yeah
i didnt cut this fellow
off for the hell of it
although it does make an
excellent weightloss strategy
legs are very heavy
hows your health now
its great nec for 14 months
really
yeah
thats fantastic
yeah
im very lucky
hey listen gus
you have to understand
hazels still pretty sick
and she will be
the rest of her life
and shes gonna want to
keep up with you
shes that kind of girl but
the truth is her lungs
ready gus
yeah
all right see you soon
all right
oh
such a beautiful day
yeah
is this where you take all
of your romantic conquests
every last one of them
thats probably why
im still a virgin
you are not still a virgin
are you really
let me show you something
see this circle
that is a circle of virgins
uhhuh
and this
is 18yearold dudes with one leg
oh
so yeah
funky bones by joep van lieshout
he sounds quite dutch
and he is
much like rik smits
and tulips
sandwich
let me guess
dutch cheese and tomato
sorry the tomatoes are mexican
how dare you
hmm
how cool is this
theyre using a skeleton
as a playground
think about that
you do love your symbols
speaking of which
youre probably wondering
why youre sitting here eating
a bad cheese sandwich
and drinking orange juice with
a guy in a rik smits jersey
it actually has crossed my mind
well hazel grace
like so many before you
and listen i say this with
the utmost of affection
you used your wish moronically
okay weve been
through this i was 13
hush i am in the midst
of a grand soliloquy here
you were young impressionable
the grim reaper staring
you right in the face
and it led you to rush into making
a wish you didnt really want
but how could little hazel grace
having never read
an imperial affliction
know that her one true wish was
to visit mr peter van houten
in his amsterdam exile
but i didnt save it so
its a good thing i saved mine
so youre saying
im not gonna give you my
wish or anything hazel
if thats what youre thinking
however
i too have an interest in meeting
this mr peter van houten
and i dont really think
it would make much sense
to meet him without the
girl who introduced me
to the book in the first place
now would it
so i talked to the genies
and theyre all for it
we leave in a month
no
mmmhmm
oh my god
oh my god
augustus
thank you
apparently they i dont know
if they do this that often
but theyre willing to
bring me too and
thats incredible
hazel thats so beautiful
i know
and a little insane
oh its super insane its
its its its crazy
well
its amsterdam
he just met you
i know
and hes giving you his wish
well were sharing the wish were
i mean he he yeah were sharing it
thats sweet
unless
what
is he your boyfriend is that
stop it do not
he is not my
mom focus
were talking about amsterdam
i like him so much i
stop
pay attention please can i go
right as your mom
i love this idea
and i i think we
should talk to dr maria
okay
i dont know
but you said that
the pet scan was encouraging
well the pet scan is encouraging
but we dont know how long
it will stay that way
okay im not seeking political asylum
its a few days its a vacation
its true
what if you get sick
in a foreign country
they have doctors in
amsterdam and cancer
well not all cancers are alike and
yours is particularly unusual hazel
the only way i could ever
authorize a trip like this
would be if someone
familiar with your case
what if my mom came
wait what
what if you came
im im sure the genies would
hook it up theyre loaded
that just might work
and then this happened
hey
hi
hey
youre okay
so what happened
the usual
fluid in the lungs
preventing oxygenation
they put a tube in
they drained a liter
and a half last night
the good news is
no tumor growth
no new tumors in your body
were so relieved
this is just a thing hazel
its a thing we can live with
mr lancaster
hows she doing
better
yeah thank you
much much better
uh they wont let me in
its family only
yeah sorry
yeah i get it
um
could you just tell her i was here
yeah of course
of course i will
okay
gus listen why dont you go home
get some rest
okay
normally the tumors start
resisting the treatment
and that hasnt happened here
yet
on the other hand
the drug may be
worsening the edema
the truth is
very few people have been on
phalanxifor as long as hazel has
we really dont know
the longterm effects
what were trying to do is
prevent endothelial growth
which when overexpressed can
contribute to disease decay
vascular inhibition
and the spread of the tumors
were working so hard to eradicate
the survival rate of patients
with severe endothelial growth
decreases exponentially the
more the condition advances
you can let go sweetie
dont be afraid
oh my god
im not gonna be a mom anymore
i have a question
yes hazel
can i still go to amsterdam
that would not be wise at this juncture
why not
is there any way we can
make that trip happen
it would increase some risks
but so does going to the mall
yes but an airplane
but they have oxygen on airplanes
youre stage four
this is an opportunity
that i may never get again
ever
if the medication is working i
dont understand why i cant
perhaps theres a scenario
no
i dont know any other
way to say this hazel
youre just too sick
im sorry
hello
yeah just a sec
hi gus again
sorry shes asleep
yeah uh okay
all right byebye
i know what youre thinking
its not fair to him
its not
he doesnt need this in his life
nobody does
a lot more trouble than its worth
no youre right
your mom and i were just
saying the same thing
i mean it could be time we
tossed you out on the street
drop you off in an orphanage
somewhere make you their problem
im serious
were not sentimental people
hazel grace
hi augustus
are you okay
no
whats the matter
talk to me
i dont know
everything
i want to go to amsterdam gus
and i want van houten to tell us
what happens after his book
i also dont really want
this particular life
i mean its really just the sky
the sky is making me sad
and theres this pathetic
old swing set
that my dad built for me
when i was a kid and
its just everything i guess
well i demand to see
this swing set of tears
i do see your point
this is one sad swing set
hazel grace i hope you realize
that you trying to
keep your distance from me
in no way lessens
my affection for you
all your efforts to keep me
from you are gonna fail
look uh
i like you
and i like hanging out
with you and everything
but i cant let this
go on any further
why not
because i dont want to hurt you
i wouldnt mind
no you dont understand
i do understand
you dont understand
i know what youre trying to say
hazel im saying i wouldnt mind
itd be a privilege to have
my heart broken by you
gus im a grenade
one day im gonna explode
and im gonna obliterate
everything in my wake and
i dont know i feel like
its my responsibility
to minimize the casualties
a grenade
i mean thats why i
dont have a hamster
well we gotta do something
about this frickin swing set
okay
swing set needs home
desperately lonely swing set
needs loving home
lonely vaguely
pedophilia swing set
seeks the butts of children
no no
no no
i like it
thats why
in case youre wondering thats
why i like you hazel grace
youre just so busy
being you you have
no idea how utterly
unprecedented you are
you cant say stuff like that
what thats how i
speak to all my friends
i know i know friends

i like your suit
thank you its the first
time ive ever worn it
thats not the suit
you wear to funerals
no
that one is not nearly this nice
when i first got sick
they told me i had an 85 percent
chance of being cancerfree
great odds
but that meant a year of
torture the loss of my leg
and still a 15 percent
chance it might fail
just before the surgery
i asked my parents if i could
buy a really nice suit
so its your death suit
thats what it is
i have one of those i got it
for my fifteenth birthday
a dress
i dont necessarily think id
wear it on a date though
so were on a date
hey you watch it
we are mr and mrs waters
oh thats just because
she cant speak english
we should be though if they ask
you know
remember what you said about vegas
yeah
do you think i could
join in on that deal
god
maybe
how about angels
mmm no
afterlife
mmm
no
well maybe i dont know
i guess i wouldnt go
as far as to say no
but i would like some evidence
what about you
absolutely
really
i mean not like a heaven where
you ride on a unicorn all day
and live in a mansion
made of clouds
but yes i definitely
believe in something
i mean otherwise
whats the point
maybe there is no point
i wont accept that
i am in love with you
you heard me
augustus
i am in love with you
and i know that love is just
a shout into the void
and that oblivion is inevitable
and that were all doomed
and that one day
all of our labors
will be returned to dust
and i know that
the sun will swallow
the only earth we will ever have
and i am in love with you
sorry
more stars
no thank you
i think well just have the check
no sir
your meal has been paid
by mr van houten
what
i dont really get that shirt
mmm
but van houten will get it
there are like fifty magritte
references in an imperial affliction
this is not a pipe
but it is a pipe
but its not
it is a drawing of a pipe
see
a drawing of a thing
is not the thing itself
nor is a tshirt of a drawing
of a thing the thing itself
hey you
when did you get so grown up
whos ready for some answers
me
this is it
im so excited
i can barely breathe
as opposed to normal
get out of here
lidewij
hi
hi im augustus
lidewij
hazel
please come in
thank you
peter theyre here
who the hell is they lidewij
they are augustus and hazel
the young fans with whom
youve been corresponding
the americans
you invited them
please come in
you know why i left
america lidewij
to never have to
encounter americans
youre american
incurably so
get rid of them
i will not do this peter
please be nice
come in please
sorry let me clear this for you
thank you
which of you is augustus waters
i am
and thats hazel
mr van houten thank you so
much for writing back to us
clearly an error in judgment
yours are the first missives
to which ive replied
and look where it got me
scotch
uh
no thank you
just me then lidewij
another scotch and soda please
perhaps some
breakfast first peter
she thinks i have
a drinking problem
i also think the earth is round
so you like my book
we love your book
yeah
we love it
augustus
he made his wish meeting
you so that we could talk
no pressure
yeah
did you dress like her on purpose
kind of
and incidentally sir
we both really
wanted to thank you
for dinner last night
and for the champagne
it was amazing
it was magical
we bought them dinner last night
it was our pleasure
youve come a long way
what can i do for you
we have some questions
obviously about what happens
at the end of your book
uh specifically to those
who anna leaves behind
like her mom
the dutch tulip man
how familiar are you
with swedish hiphop
i would say limited
uh lidewij play
bomfalleralla immediately
okay
we dont speak swedish sir
who the hell speaks swedish
the important thing is not what
nonsense the voices are saying
but what the voices are feeling
are you messing with us
like is this some
sort of performance
gus sit down
all right so at the end
of the book annas
lets imagine
youre racing a tortoise
the tortoise has
a tenyard head start
in the time it takes you
to run ten yards
the tortoise has moved maybe
one yard and so on forever
youre faster than the tortoise
but you can never
catch him you see
you can only decrease his lead
now certainly you can
run past the tortoise
as long as you dont contemplate
the mechanics involved
but the question of how
turns out to be so complicated
that no one really solved it
until cantors proof
that some infinities
are bigger than other infinities
i assume that answers
your question
hazel im sorry i have
no idea whats going on
yet you seemed so intelligent
in print mr waters
has the cancer found its
way into your brain
peter
can we for one second
just focus on anna
please
i understand that the story ends
in the middle of a sentence
because she dies or that she
becomes too sick to continue
i am not interested in
talking about that book
but that doesnt mean that her family
and friends dont have a future right
right
i said im not interested
but you promised
nothing happens theyre fiction
they cease to exist the
moment the novel ends
but they cant
i get it in a literary sense
or whatever but
i cant do this lidewij
its impossible
not to imagine what
i will not indulge
your childish whims
i refuse to pity you in the manner
in which you are accustomed
i do not want your pity
of course you do
like all sick kids your
existence depends on it
you are fated to live out your days
peter
as the child you were
when diagnosed
a child who believes there is
a life after a novel ends
and we as adults we pity this
so we pay for your treatments
your oxygen machines
peter thats enough
you are a sideeffect
to an evolutionary process
that cares little
for individual lives
you are a failed
experiment in mutation
listen douchepants
there is nothing that youre gonna
tell me about my disease
that i dont already know
i came here for one thing
and one thing only
that is for you
to tell me what happens
at the end of this goddamn book
i cant tell you
bullshit
i cant
then make something up
i want you to leave
have you ever stopped
to ask yourself
why you care so much
about your silly questions
oh go fuck yourself
hey its okay
its okay
ill write you a sequel
all right ill write you a sequel
itll be better than any piece of
shit that drunk guy could write
itll have blood and
guts and sacrifice
youll love it
so sorry that i spent your
wish on that asshole
no you did not spend it on him
you spent it on us
hazel and augustus
im very sorry
circumstance has made him cruel
i thought meeting you
would help him
that he could see that his
work has shaped real lives
but im very sorry
perhaps we can do some sightseeing
have you been to
the anne frank house
im not going anywhere
with that man
no
he is not invited
im afraid theres no elevator
oh thats all right
there are many stairs
steep stairs
i can do it
hazel we dont have to
i can do it
lets go
franks family came from
frankfurt in germany
anne franks diary would
become world famous
its difficult in times like these
its a wonder i havent
abandoned all my ideals
they seem so absurd
and impractical
yet i cling to them
because i still believe
in spite of everything that
people are truly good at heart
its utterly impossible
for me to build my life
shall we
yeah
yeah
hazel ill carry it if you want
i got it
wow
so this is the actual bookcase
that hid the frank family
whoa
i got it
thank you
were much too young to
deal with these problems
but they keep thrusting
themselves on us
until finally were forced
to think up a solution
you okay hazel
yeah
dont worry take your time
sorry
yeah
yeah
and yet when i look
up at the sky
i somehow feel that everything
will change for the better
that this cruelty too will end
you okay
yeah
hazel i think thats enough
you dont need
you know
uhhuh
i got this
all is as it should be
god wishes to see people happy
where there is hope
hazel
there is life
well done
yeah
you okay
yeah
this is it look
all right
oh yeah oh my god
thanks
the only member of the frank
family to survive was otto
annes father
at such moments
i cant think about the misery
but about the beauty
that still remains
try to recapture the
happiness within yourself
think of all the beauty
in everything around you
and be happy
bravo
i fell in love with him
the way you fall asleep
slowly and then all at once
it just sort of ends right above
where the knee would be
and tapers off
what
my leg
you know just so youre prepared
gus
get over yourself
wait
i cant its stuck
i love you so much
augustus waters
i love you too hazel grace
so so much
augustus i cant breathe
its okay
hazel
youre so beautiful
stop
no youre so beautiful

i dont know it just came out
i was so angry
what a monster
mom it was awful
then what happened
we went to anne frank house
oh you did
it was really awesome

it was so awesome
and after that
we just walked around
that sounds lovely
oh my gosh
we probably still have
a few hours right

the van gogh museum

to do everything but
youre just gonna have
to come back is all
could you just not be
ridiculous right now please

just have a little time alone
sure gus
um i am gonna run to the room
and be ready whenever you
guys want to do something

what is it
just before you went into the
hospital there was this
i felt an ache in my hip
so i had a pet scan
and it lit up like
a christmas tree
the lining of my chest
and my liver
everywhere
im sorry
i shouldve told you

a wishgranting factory
hey listen

but that is not what happened
it hurts so much
im so stupid
baby its okay its okay
hazel
will you tell me a story
a story
or like a poem
i do know i i know a poem
will you tell me it
the red wheelbarrow
by william carlos williams
so much depends upon
a red wheelbarrow
glazed with rain water
beside the white chickens
thats it is that all
no no no of course not
of course not
so much depends upon
a blue sky
cut open by the branches of trees
and so much depends upon the
the transparent gtube
erupting from the belly of
the bluelipped boy
so much depends
on this observer of the universe
hows he doing
hes had a tough night hazel
his blood pressures low
his heart
what about the chemo
they are gonna stop the chemo
can i see him
well tell him you were here
yeah
okay
yeah
im just gonna hang out for
a while if you dont mind
yeah of course
take your time
here we go bud
good
all right sweetie
okay
hi
what are you thinking about
oblivion
i know its kids stuff
or whatever but
i always thought i would be a hero
i always thought id have
a grand story to tell
you know something they would
publish in all the papers and
i mean i was supposed
to be special
you are special augustus
yeah i know but
you know what i mean
i do know what you mean
i just dont agree with you
you know this obsession you
have with being remembered
dont get mad
i am mad
im mad because i think youre
special and is that not enough
you think that the only way
to lead a meaningful life
is for everyone to remember
you for everyone to love you
guess what gus
this is your life okay
this is all you get
you get me
and you get your family
and you get this world
and thats it
and if thats not enough for you
then im sorry
but its not nothing
because i love you
and im gonna remember you
im sorry youre right
i just wish you
would be happy with that
hey
its a good life hazel grace
its not over yet you know
oh augustus
one of the less bullshitty
conventions of the cancer genre
is the convention known as
the last good day
when it seems like the inexorable
decline has suddenly plateaued
when the pain is
just for a minute bearable
the problem of course is that
theres no way of knowing
that your last good day
is your last good day
at the time its just
another decent day
hello augustus
good evening hazel grace
a quick question for you
did you ever write that eulogy
i asked you to prepare
i may have
do you think you could
find your way down
to the literal heart of jesus
in the next few minutes
maybe is everything okay
i love you hazel grace
can i have the keys
oh
where you going were gonna eat something
i have to go
hazel you have to be hungry
you didnt even eat lunch
im just not hungry
hazel you cannot not eat
im aggressively unhungry
hazel i know gus is sick but you
got to take care of yourself
this has nothing to do with gus
well then youve
got to stay healthy
come on just eat something honey
stay healthy
okay im not healthy
and im gonna die
do you realize that im dying
and youre gonna be here
and youre not gonna have anyone
to look after or hover around
and youre not gonna be a mother
anymore and im sorry
but theres nothing
i can do about that
so can i please go
why would you say that to me
because you said that
what are you talking about
in the icu
hazel
thats not the truth
i was wrong
all right
even if you died
when
even when you die
ill always be your mother
its the greatest
thing ill ever be
that is my biggest fear mom
when i am gone
youre not gonna
have a life anymore
youre just gonna sit and
youre gonna stare at walls
or youre gonna
off yourselves or
hazel honey
were not gonna do that
losing you
that is gonna hurt like hell
but you of all people know its
possible to live with pain
you just do it
im taking classes in social work
wait youre what
yeah um
you know if i can take
what weve been through
and help other people
maybe counsel families
mom how could you
not tell me this
we didnt want you
to feel abandoned
feel abandoned
you guys this is
this is the best news
you go
okay
baby
straight ahead yeah
to your left a little bit
thats a step right
yeah put your hand out
theres a podium to your right
yeah perfect
beautiful
hi
youre late
how you doing you look
ravishing hazel grace
i know right
whats going on guys
tell her gus
i wanted to attend my own funeral
i mean im hopeful that ill be
able to attend as a ghost but
however just in case
it doesnt work out
i decided to plan this prefuneral
ready
augustus waters was a
cocky son of a bitch
but we forgave him
not because of his
superhuman good looks
or because he only got 19 years
when he shouldve gotten way more
18 years buddy
dude come on really
im assuming you have a little more
time you interrupting bastard
interrupt me in the middle of my eulogy
youre supposed to be dead
but when the scientists
from the future
come to my house with robot eyes
and they tell me to try them on
im gonna tell those scientists
to piss off because
because gus i dont even want
to see a world without you
i dont
i dont want to see a world
without augustus waters
then having made my point ill
probably put the robot eyes on
because you know
theyre robot eyes
sounds awesome
and i dont know um
this is just so hard
um
godspeed
yeah
hazel can i get a hand here
to the right a little bit
yeah and turn around
sit down there you go
its down to you hazel grace
hello
my name is hazel grace lancaster
and augustus waters was the
starcrossed love of my life
ours was an epic love story
and i probably wont be able to
get more than a sentence out
without disappearing
into a puddle of tears
like all real love stories
ours will die with us
as it should
you know id kind of hoped that
he would be the one eulogizing me
because theres really
no one else
yeah no um
im not gonna talk about our
love story because i cant
so instead
im gonna talk about math
i am not a mathematician
but i do know this
there are infinite numbers
between zero and one
theres pointone pointonetwo
and pointoneonetwo and
and an infinite
collection of others
of course
there is a bigger infinite
set of numbers
between zero and two
or between zero and a million
some infinities are simply
bigger than other infinities
a writer that we used
to like taught us that
you know i want more numbers
than im likely to get
and god
do i want more days
for augustus waters
than what he got
but gus
my love
i cannot tell you
how thankful i am
for our little infinity
hold on
you gave me a forever
within the numbered days
and for that i am
i am eternally grateful
i love you so much
i love you too
augustus waters died eight
days later in the icu
when the cancer
which was made of him
stopped his heart which
was also made of him
it was unbearable
the whole thing
every second worse than the last
one of the first things
they ask you in the er
is to rate your pain
on a scale from one to ten
ive been asked this question
hundreds of times
and i remember once
when i couldnt catch my breath
and it felt like
my chest was on fire
the nurse asked me
to rate the pain
though i couldnt speak
i held up nine fingers
later when i started
feeling better
the nurse came in
and she called me a fighter
you know how i know
she said
you called a ten a nine
but that wasnt the truth
i didnt call it a nine
because i was brave
the reason i called it a nine was
because i was saving my ten
and this was it
this was the great
and terrible ten
i will fear no evil
for you are with me
your rod and your staff
they comfort me
you prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies
you anoint my head with oil
my cup overflows
surely goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life
and i will dwell
in the house of the lord
forever
augustus waters
fought hard for many years
his battle was a courageous
one and his strength
what a load of shit huh kid
was a source of inspiration
for each and every one of us
let us pray
we thank you lord for the
life of augustus waters
we need to fakepray now
for his strength
and his courage
lord we ask that you be with
us today that you be close
that you comfort
his friends and family
thank you for your presence lord
all this we pray in jesus name
amen
amen
now we are going to hear
from gus special friend
hazel lancaster
not that it really matters
but i was his girlfriend
theres a beautiful quote
in gus home that reads
if you want the rainbow you
have to deal with the rain
even in his last few days
um
i didnt believe a word
he was always able
to crack a smile
but thats okay
i knew this was
the right thing to do
funerals id decided
are not for the dead
theyre for the living
hey want some company
no im okay
im just gonna drive
for a bit by myself
love you
love you
you spoke beautifully
ill see you soon
drive safe
okay
may i
omnis cellula e cellula
your boy waters and i corresponded
quite a bit in his last days
oh so you read your fan mail now
i wouldnt exactly call him a fan
he detested me
but he was quite insistent
i attend his funeral
and tell you what became
of anna and her mother
so here i am
and thats your answer
omnis cellula e cellula
life comes from life
im really not in the mood
you dont want an explanation
no i dont
thank you though
have a great life
you remind me of her
i remind a lot of people
of a lot of people
my daughter was eight
and she suffered
beautifully for so long
she had leukemia like anna
just like anna
im very sorry for your loss
and im sorry for yours and
sorry for ruining your trip
you didnt ruin our trip
we had an amazing trip
are you familiar with
the trolley problem
theres a thought experiment
in the field of ethics
known as the trolley problem
philippa foot was an
english philosopher
oh my god
hazel im trying to
explain something to you
im trying to give you
what you wanted
no youre not
you are a drunk
and youre a failure
and i need you to get out
of my car right now
so that i can go home and
be by myself and grieve
youll want to read this
i dont want to read anything
can you just get out of my car
please get out of my car
fine
can i come in
im so so sorry
yeah
it was a privilege
though wasnt it
to love him
gives you an idea
how we feel about you
hazel
theres a friend here to see you
do you know if it hurt or whatever
apparently he was struggling
for breath for a long time
and then eventually
he just went unconscious
it wasnt great or anything
dying sucks
gus really loved you you know
i know
he wouldnt shut up about it
yeah
it was annoying he
talked about you so much
i didnt find it that annoying
i know i know you didnt
did you get that letter
from your author friend
ew hes not my friend
how do you know about that
well i was talking
to him at the cemetery
and he said he came all this way
to give that letter to you
yeah well im over it
i have no interest in reading another
word of that assholes again
no he didnt write it
gus wrote it
what
apparently gus wrote something down
and then sent it to van houten
oh my god
mr van houten im a good
person but a shitty writer
youre a shitty person
but a good writer
i think wed make a good team
i dont want to ask you
for any favors
but if you have the time and from
what i saw you have plenty
please fix this for me
its a eulogy for hazel
she asked me to write one
and im trying
i just i could
use a little flair
see the thing is we all
want to be remembered
but hazels different
hazel knows the truth
she didnt want a million admirers
she just wanted one
and she got it
maybe she wasnt loved widely
but she was loved deeply
and isnt that more
than most of us get
when hazel was sick
i knew i was dying
but i didnt want to say so
she was in the icu and i
snuck in for 10 minutes
and i sat with her
before i got caught
her eyes were closed
her skin pale
but her hands
were still her hands
still warm and her nails were painted
this dark blueblack color
and i just held them
and i willed myself to imagine
a world without us
and what a worthless world
that would be
shes so beautiful
you dont get tired
of looking at her
you never worry if shes
smarter than you
because you know she is
shes funny without
ever being mean
i love her
god i love her
im so lucky to love her
van houten
you dont get to choose if
you get hurt in this world
but you do have a say
