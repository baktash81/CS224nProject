you can sugarcoat it 
the way they do in movies
and romance novels   
where beautiful people
learn beautiful lessons   
where nothing is too messed
up that can t be fixed   
with an apology
and a peter gabriel song 
i like that version as much
as the next girl does 
believe me 
it s just not the truth 
this is the truth 
sorry 
late in the winter
of my seventeenth year   
my mother decided
that i was depressed 
she just eats like a bird 
she barely leaves the house 
i am not depressed  mom 
she s reading the same
book over and over 
she s depressed 
i m not depressed 
the booklets and the websites
always list depression as
a side effect of cancer 
depression s not
a side effect of cancer 
it s a side effect of dying 
which is what was happening to me 
i may switch you to zoloft 
or lexapro 
and twice a day instead of once 
  why stop there 
  hmm 
really  just keep them coming 
i m like the keith richards
of cancer kids 
have you been going to that
support group i suggested 
yeah  it s not my thing 
support groups can be a great way
for you to connect
with people who are   
who are    what 
on the same journey 
 journey   really 
give it a chance 
who knows  you might even
find it enlightening 
all right 
are you guys ready 
we are gathered here today
literally in the heart of jesus 
we re here with j c 
who wants to share their
story with the group 
i m angel 
i have acute myeloid leukemia 
sid  acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
hi  i m pj  um 
i have neuroblastoma 
i m patrick 
testicular 
i ll spare you the gory details
of patrick s ball cancer 
basically  they found it
in his nuts   
they cut most of it out  and he
almost died  but he didn t die 
so now  here he is 
divorced  friendless   
living on his parents  couch   
exploiting his cancer tastic
past in the heart of jesus 
literally 
to show us that one day 
if we re lucky   
we could be just like him 
who s next 
hazel 
um   
i m hazel 
uh  thyroid  originally   
but now with quite the impressive
satellite colony in my lungs 
and how are you doing 
uh  you mean besides
the terminal cancer 
all right  i guess 
we re here for you  hazel 
why don t i play another song 
christ is our friend
and he ll be there till the end
christ is our friend
and he ll be there till the end
christ
hey  sweet pea 
so    was it awesome 
 yeah  mom  it was awesome  
and that was my life 
reality shows 
doctor s appointments 
eight prescription drugs 
three times a day 
but worst  worst  worst of all   
support group 
  you cannot make me 
  of course we can 
we re your parents 
come on  we ve been through this 
you need to go 
you need to make friends 
and be a teenager 
mom  if you want me
to be a teenager 
you don t send me to support group 
you gotta get me a fake id
so that i can go to clubs   
and drink gimlets and take pot 
uh  you don t  take  pot 
well  that is the kind of thing
i would know with a fake id 
can you just get in the car  please 
and so i went 
not because i wanted to  or because
i thought it would help me   
but for the same reason
i did anything these days 
to make my parents happy 
i really don t understand
why i can t just drive myself 
it s not like you re
gonna do anything 
you re just gonna sit here
and wait again 
of course i m not 
no  i ve got stuff to do 
i m gonna do errands 
yeah 
i love you 
i love you  too 
have fun 
the only thing worse than
biting it from cancer   
is having a kid
bite it from cancer 
hey 
make some friends 
oh  sorry 
  i ll take the stairs 
  no problem 
thank you 
sorry 
my bad 
i m sorry 
oh  my god 
so  who would like to start 
does anyone want to start 
who wants to kick it off 
go ahead 
i m beth  i have
spindle cell sarcoma 
it s been an okay week 
isaac  i know that you re facing
some challenges right now 
do you want to share
with the group 
or maybe your friend  here 
no  i ll share 
hey  guys  uh   
hi  i m isaac 
i have retinoblastoma 
we had surgery on one eye
when i was younger   
so this is a glass eye 
and then i m going in to the
hospital to have another surgery   
to take out the other eye 
so  after that surgery  i m
just gonna be totally blind 
but i m lucky  because i have this
beautiful  smoking hot girlfriend   
who s way out of my league  monica 
and i have great friends like
augustus waters to help me out 
so  that s what s up  thanks 
we re here for you  isaac 
thank you 
your turn  gus 
yeah  sure 
um  i m augustus waters 
i m 18 years old
and i had a touch of osteosarcoma
about a year and a half ago 
so  i ve lost this baby
as a result 
and  uh  now i m part
cyborg  which is awesome 
but  really  i m just
here at isaac s request 
and how are you feeling  gus 
i m grand  yeah 
i m on a roller coaster that
only goes up  my friend 
maybe you d like to share
your fears with the group 
my fears 
oblivion 
oblivion 
yeah 
you see  i intend to live
an extraordinary life 
to be remembered 
so  i d say if i have any fears 
it would be to not do that 
would anyone else in the
group like to speak to that 
hazel 
unexpected 
i just want to say
that there s gonna
come a time when
all of us are dead 
there was a time before humans
and there s gonna be a time after 
it could be tomorrow  it could
be a million years from now 
and when it does 
there will be no one left   
to remember cleopatra or
muhammad ali or mozart   
let alone any of us 
oblivion s inevitable 
and if that scares you  then
i suggest you ignore it 
god knows it s what
everyone else does 
well  that s some good advice 
and i like all this because it s
really nice to hear everybody   
  thank you 
  mmm hmm 
  always 
  always 
  always 
  always 
 literally  
i thought we were
in a church basement   
but apparently we were literally
in the heart of jesus 
oh  yeah 
what s your name 
hazel 
no  what s your full name 
hazel grace lancaster 
what 
i didn t say anything 
why are you looking
at me like that 
because you re beautiful 
oh  my god 
i enjoy looking
at beautiful people 
see  i decided a while back   
not to deny myself the simpler
pleasures of existence 
particularly  as you
so astutely pointed out 
we re all gonna die pretty soon 
okay  well  that s great 
but i am not beautiful 
hey  gus 
hi  lisa 
i like it when you say it first 
i like it when you say it first 
okay 
always 
always 
what is with the  always  
 always  is  like  their thing 
they ll  always  love
each other  and whatnot 
they probably texted  always  to each
other 14 million times this year 
he s got to be hurting her boob 
let s go watch a movie 
  what 
  hmm 
huh 
um   
i m free later this week 
we could   
no  i mean now 
you could be an axe murderer 
there s always that possibility 
come on  hazel grace 
take a risk 
i don t   
really 
that is disgusting 
what 
what  do you think that
that s cool or something 
you just ruined this whole thing 
  the whole thing 
  yes  this whole thing 
oh  man 
ugh  and you were
doing really well  too 
god  there s always
a hamartia  isn t there 
and yours is even though
you had freaking cancer   
you re willing to give
money to a corporation   
for the chance to acquire
even more cancer 
let me just tell you that not
being able to breathe sucks 
it totally sucks 
 hamartia  
it s a fatal flaw 
ah  a fatal   
hazel grace 
they don t actually hurt
you unless you light them 
hmm 
i ve never lit one 
it s a metaphor  see 
you put the thing that does the
killing right between your teeth   
but you never give it
the power to kill you 
a metaphor 
hey  sweetheart 
is it top model time 
no  uh   
i ve made plans
with augustus waters 
whoa 
oh  my god 
ooh 
yeah  i failed my test
a couple times 
you don t say 
actually  the fourth time
i took the test 
it was going about
how this is going 
and when it was over   
the instructor looks over
at me  and she says   
 your driving  while unpleasant 
is not technically unsafe  
cancer perk 
total cancer perk 
so  tell me about you 
um  i was 13 when they found it 
pretty much worst case scenario 
thyroid  stage four 
not much they could do 
which didn t stop them  of course 
surgery 
radiation 
chemo 
more radiation 
all of which worked for a while 
but  then stopped working 
and then one day  my lungs
started filling up with water 
nurse  we need a nurse right now 
i couldn t breathe 
no one could get it under control 
you can let go  sweetie 
don t be afraid 
that should have been the end 
oh  my god 
but then something
strange happened 
the antibiotics kicked in 
they drained the fluid
from my lungs 
i got some strength back 
next thing i know  i found
myself in an experimental trial 
you know  the ones that are famous
in the republic of
cancervania for not working 
it s called phalanxifor 
it didn t work in over
70  of the patients   
but for some reason
it s been working for me 
so  they called it
 the miracle  
of course  my lungs still
suck at being lungs   
but  theoretically  they could
continue to suck like this   
for  i don t know  a while maybe 
so  are you back in school 
i got my ged  so i m
taking classes at mcc 
whoa  a college girl 
well  that explains
the aura of sophistication 
oh  careful 
oops

it s a novel 
it s my favorite novel 
wait  does it have zombies in it 
zombies  no 
stormtroopers 
no  it s not that kind of a book 
okay  what s it about 
uh  cancer 
it s about cancer 
but not like that 
trust me  it s amazing 
the author  his name
is peter van houten 
he s the only person i ve ever
come across in my life   
who  a  understands what
it s like to be dying   
but  b  hasn t actually died 
okay 
i will read this horrible book
with this very boring title   
that does not include
zombies or stormtroopers 
and in exchange   
you will read this 
this haunting 
yet brilliant novelization
of my favorite video game 
 counterinsurgence  
yeah  don t laugh  it s awesome 
it s about honor  and sacrifice 
and bravery  and heroism 
it s about embracing your destiny 
and leaving a mark on the world 
well  thank you 
wait  your hands are so cold 
well  they re not so much cold
as just under oxygenated 
  hazel grace 
  hmm 
i love it when you
talk medical to me 
that s different 
did he give it to you 
by  it   do you mean herpes 
wow 
yes  i did 
it s a mother s dream

yeah 
we just hung out  it s not like

the goji berry theme going 
because they re
an amazing antioxidant 
well  i like it 
we should do it every year 
  every year 
  we should do it every year 
i know 
i really do like these 
honey  would you like
to be excused

hazel grace 
welcome to the sweet torture of
reading an imperial affliction 
but now i m breaking all the rules 
are you okay 
and now i m breaking all the rules
uh    me  yeah 
i am excellent 
i am  however  with isaac  and   
isaac  does support group hazel
make this better or worse 
i ve been wasting all my time
isaac  focus on me 
been wasting all my time
how fast can you get here 
um   
great  well 
the door s open 
i gotta run  bye 
hello 
hazel 
isaac  hazel grace from the
support group is here 
  hi 
  hi 
uh    a gentle reminder   
isaac s in the midst of a
psychotic episode right now 
you look really nice  by the way 
i like this color on you 
thank you 
isaac 
isaac  hazel s here 
hey  isaac 
hey  hazel 
how you doing 
i m doing okay 
it seems isaac and monica are
no longer a going concern 
oh  isaac  i m so sorry 
do you want to talk about it 
no  i just want to cry
and play video games 
however  you know  it doesn t
hurt to talk to him   
if you have any sage words
of feminine advice 
i actually think that his
response is fairly appropriate 
 pain demands to be felt  
you re quoting my book 
she said she wanted to break up
with me before the surgery   
because she couldn t handle it 
i m about to lose my eyesight 
and she can t handle it 
i kept saying  always  to her 
like   always  
and she kept talking over me
and not saying it back  and   
it was like i was gone
already  you know 
you know  sometimes   
people don t understand
the promises
that they re making
when they make them 
i know  but   
i feel like such a loser 
i still have her necklace on 
take it off 
dude  take that off 
yeah 
here we go  man 
here we go 
i just want to kick something 
don t hit that  don t hit that 
uh   
  hit this 
  sorry 
i ve been wanting to call
you for a few days now   
but i ve been waiting
until i could form
a coherent thought about
an imperial affliction 
one second 
isaac 
pillows don t break 
you need to break something 
try this 
  the trophy 
  yeah 
are you sure 
i ve been looking for a way to tell
my father i kind of hate basketball 
go to town 
always 
an imperial affliction 
yes  i m so glad that you liked it 
yes  i did 
but the ending 
i know 
it is rather abrupt 
 rather abrupt   are you kidding 
it s evil 
i mean  i understand
that she dies   
but there s an unwritten
contract between author and   
  gus 
  yeah 
  cool 
  sure 
between author and reader 
and i feel like ending your book
in the middle of a sentence   
violates that contract 
don t you think 
okay  yes 
i know what you mean   
but  to be completely honest 
i think it s just so truthful 
you just die in the middle of life 
you die in the middle
of a sentence 
and  i don t know   
but i really would like to know
what happens to everyone
after anna dies 
like anna s mother 
yes  and the dutch tulip man 
and sisyphus the hamster 
yes 
have you tried contacting
this peter van houten fellow 
i ve written him so many letters 
but he s never responded 
apparently  he moved to amsterdam
and became a recluse  and   
  shame 
  yeah 
isaac   
you feeling better  buddy 
that s the thing about pain 
it demands to be felt 
i ll help you clean this up 
hazel grace 
augustus waters 
i cannot stop thinking
about this goddamn book 
you re welcome 
however  we do need closure 
don t you think 
that is exactly what i was asking
van houten for in my letters 
but he never responded 
um  nope 
 dear mr  waters   
 i am writing to thank you for
your electronic correspondence 
 i am grateful to anyone
who sets aside the time   
 to read my book  
augustus 
yes 
what are you doing 
i may have found   
van houten s assistant 
emailed her 
augustus 
she may have forwarded
that email on to van houten 
shall i continue 
oh  my god  yeah  go  go  go 
 i am particularly
indebted to you  sir  
hazel grace 
he just called me  sir  
augustus  keep reading 
keep reading 
 both for your kind words about
an imperial affliction   
 and for taking the time   
 to tell me that the book  and
here i quote you directly   
  meant a great deal to you
and your friend hazel grace 
you did not  you did not 
you did not  you did not 
of course i did 
 to answer your question  no  i have
not written anything else  nor will i 
 i do not feel like continuing to
share my thoughts with readers   
 would benefit either them or me 
 however  thank you   
 for your generous email 
 yours most sincerely 
peter van houten  
so  yeah  that just happened 
oh  my god 
i ve been trying to tell
you  i m kind of awesome 
do you think that i   
check your inbox 
oh  my god 
oh  my god  augustus 
i m freaking out  i m freaking out 
dear mr  peter van houten 
my name is hazel grace lancaster 
my friend augustus waters   
who read your book
at my recommendation   
just received an email
from you at this address 
i hope you will not mind that
he shared that email with me 
i was wondering if you wouldn t mind
answering a few questions i have   
about what happens
after the end of the book 
specifically the following 
does anna s mom marry
the dutch tulip man 
and is the dutch tulip man
up to something   
or is he just
completely misunderstood 
lastly  i was hoping you could shed
some light on sisyphus the hamster 
these questions have
haunted me for years   
and i don t know how long i have
left to get answers to them 
i know that these are not
important literary questions   
 and that your book is full of
important literary questions   
 but i would just
really like to know 
 and  of course  if you ever do
decide to write anything else   
 i would love to read it 
 frankly  i d read
your grocery lists 
 yours  with great admiration 
hazel grace lancaster  
not bad 
you think 
yeah  i mean 
it s a bit pretentious   
but then again  van houten
uses words like  tendentious 
and  bacchanalia   so   
i think he ll like it 
is it really 1 00 am 
is it 
yeah  i guess it is 
i should probably go to sleep 
okay 
okay 
okay 
okay 
perhaps  okay 
will be our  always  
okay 
oh  my god 
 dear ms  lancaster   
 i cannot answer your questions 
at least not in writing   
 because to do so
would constitute a sequel   
 which you might publish or
otherwise share on the internet 
 not that i don t trust you 
but how could i trust you 
 i barely know you 
 should ever you find
yourself in amsterdam 
 do pay a visit at your leisure  
what 
 yours most sincerely 
peter van houten  
oh  my god 
what is this life 
hazel 
  mom 
  hazel  what s wrong 
mom  look at this 
come here  come here  come here 
look 
  what 
  yeah 
peter van houten 
look what he said 
 should ever you find
yourself in amsterdam  
i have to go 
that s incredible 
he invited us to amsterdam 
amsterdam 
  wow 
  can we go 
i mean  do you think
we could actually go 
i mean  amsterdam 
i want you to have everything
you want in the world 
but we don t have
the money  you know 
just getting all the
equipment over there 
how do we do that 
yeah  duh  i m sorry 
hey  you  i am so sorry 
it s okay 
why don t you just ask
the genies  use your wish 
i already used it 
pre miracle 
what d you use it on 
not disney 
hazel grace  you did not
go to disney world 
  you did not use your last dying wish   
  i was 13 
to go to disney world 
and epcot center 
oh  my god 
it was actually a really fun trip 
that s the saddest thing
i ve ever heard 
i met goofy 
now i m just embarrassed 
why are you embarrassed 
i can t believe i have a crush on
a girl with such cliche wishes 
terrible 
you coming 
the most important
thing in any mri   
is to lie completely still 
but that day 
it was almost impossible 
hey  gus  how are you 
hi  mrs  lancaster 
hey  rik smits jersey 
  yeah  it is indeed 
  i loved that guy 
i m augustus waters 
nice to meet you 
i m michael 
  it s good to see you 
  hi  mrs  lancaster 
good to see you 
hi  hazel grace 
hi 
how would you like to go
on a picnic with me 
um  i would love to go
on a picnic with you 
shall we 
no  let me   
i smell like hospital 
so i should just change 
so  uh   
you re a survivor yourself  huh 
yeah 
i didn t cut this fellow
off for the hell of it 
although it does make an
excellent weight loss strategy 
legs are very heavy 
how s your health now 
it s great  nec for 14 months 
  really 
  yeah 
  that s fantastic 
  yeah 
i m very lucky 
hey  listen  gus 
you have to understand 
hazel s still pretty sick 
and she will be
the rest of her life 
and she s gonna want to
keep up with you 
she s that kind of girl  but
the truth is  her lungs   
ready  gus 
yeah 
all right  see you soon 
all right 
oh 
such a beautiful day 
yeah 
is this where you take all
of your romantic conquests 
every last one of them 
that s probably why
i m still a virgin 
you are not still a virgin 
are you really 
let me show you something 
see this circle 
that is a circle of virgins 
uh huh 
and this   
is 18 year old dudes with one leg 
  oh   
  so  yeah 
funky bones by joep van lieshout 
he sounds quite dutch 
and he is 
much like rik smits 
and tulips 
sandwich 
let me guess 
dutch cheese and tomato 
sorry  the tomatoes are mexican 
how dare you 
hmm 
how cool is this 
they re using a skeleton
as a playground 
think about that 
you do love your symbols 
speaking of which 
you re probably wondering   
why you re sitting here eating
a bad cheese sandwich   
and drinking orange juice with
a guy in a rik smits jersey 
it actually has crossed my mind 
well  hazel grace 
like so many before you   
and listen  i say this with
the utmost of affection   
you used your wish moronically 
okay  we ve been
through this  i was 13 
hush  i am in the midst
of a grand soliloquy  here 
you were young  impressionable   
the grim reaper staring
you right in the face   
and it led you to rush into making
a wish you didn t really want 
but  how could little hazel grace 
having never read
an imperial affliction   
know that her one true wish was
to visit mr  peter van houten   
in his amsterdam exile 
but i didn t save it  so   
it s a good thing i saved mine 
so  you re saying   
i m not gonna give you my
wish or anything  hazel 
if that s what you re thinking 
however   
i  too  have an interest in meeting
this mr  peter van houten   
and i don t really think
it would make much sense   
to meet him without the
girl who introduced me
to the book in the first place   
now  would it 
so i talked to the genies 
and they re all for it 
we leave in a month 
no 
mmm hmm 
oh  my god 
oh  my god 
augustus 
thank you 
apparently  they    i don t know
if they do this that often 
but they re willing to
bring me  too  and   
that s incredible 
hazel  that s so beautiful 
i know 
and a little insane 
oh  it s super insane  it s   
it s    it s    it s crazy 
  well   
  it s amsterdam 
he just met you   
  i know 
     and he s giving you his wish 
well  we re sharing the wish  we re   
i mean  he    he    yeah  we re sharing it 
that s sweet 
unless   
what 
is he your boyfriend  is that   
stop it  do not   
he is not my   
mom  focus 
we re talking about amsterdam 
  i like him so much  i   
  stop 
pay attention  please  can i go 
right  as your mom 
i love this idea 
and i    i think we
should talk to dr  maria 
okay 
i don t know 
but you said that
the pet scan was encouraging 
well  the pet scan is encouraging 
but we don t know how long
it will stay that way 
okay  i m not seeking political asylum 
it s a few days  it s a vacation 
  it s true 
  what if you get sick 
in a foreign country 
they have doctors in
amsterdam  and cancer 
well  not all cancers are alike  and
yours is particularly unusual  hazel 
the only way i could ever
authorize a trip like this
would be if someone
familiar with your case   
what if my mom came 
wait  what 
what if you came 
i m    i m sure the genies would
hook it up  they re loaded 
that just might work 
and then this happened 
hey 
hi 
  hey 
  you re okay 
so  what happened 
the usual 
fluid in the lungs
preventing oxygenation 
they put a tube in 
they drained a liter
and a half last night 
the good news is   
no tumor growth 
no new tumors in your body 
we re so relieved 
this is just a thing  hazel 
it s a thing we can live with 
mr  lancaster 
how s she doing 
better 
yeah  thank you 
much  much better 
uh  they won t let me in 
it s family only 
yeah  sorry 
yeah  i get it 
um   
could you just tell her i was here 
yeah  of course 
of course i will 
  okay 
  gus  listen  why don t you go home 
get some rest 
okay 
normally  the tumors start
resisting the treatment   
and that hasn t happened here   
yet 
on the other hand   
the drug may be
worsening the edema 
the truth is   
very few people have been on
phalanxifor as long as hazel has 
we really don t know
the long term effects 
what we re trying to do is
prevent endothelial growth   
which  when overexpressed  can
contribute to disease  decay   
vascular inhibition   
and the spread of the tumors
we re working so hard to eradicate 
the survival rate of patients
with severe endothelial growth   
decreases exponentially the
more the condition advances 
you can let go  sweetie 
don t be afraid 
oh  my god 
i m not gonna be a mom anymore 
i have a question 
yes  hazel 
can i still go to amsterdam 
  that would not be wise at this juncture 
  why not 
is there any way we can
make that trip happen 
it would increase some risks 
but so does going to the mall 
yes  but an airplane 
but they have oxygen on airplanes 
you re stage four 
this is an opportunity
that i may never get again 
ever 
if the medication is working  i
don t understand why i can t   
perhaps there s a scenario   
no 
i don t know any other
way to say this  hazel 
you re just too sick 
i m sorry 
hello 
yeah  just a sec 
hi  gus    again 
sorry  she s asleep 
yeah  uh  okay 
all right  bye bye 
i know what you re thinking 
it s not fair to him 
it s not 
he doesn t need this in his life 
nobody does 
a lot more trouble than it s worth 
no  you re right 
your mom and i were just
saying the same thing 
i mean  it could be time we
tossed you out on the street 
drop you off in an orphanage
somewhere  make you their problem 
i m serious 
we re not sentimental people 
hazel grace 
hi  augustus 
are you okay 
no 
what s the matter 
talk to me 
i don t know 
everything 
i want to go to amsterdam  gus 
and i want van houten to tell us
what happens after his book 
i also don t really want
this particular life 
i mean  it s really just the sky 
the sky is making me sad 
and there s this pathetic
old swing set   
that my dad built for me
when i was a kid and   
it s just everything  i guess 
well  i demand to see
this swing set of tears 
i do see your point 
this is one sad swing set 
hazel grace  i hope you realize   
that you trying to
keep your distance from me
in no way lessens
my affection for you 
all your efforts to keep me
from you are gonna fail 
look  uh   
i like you 
and i like hanging out
with you and everything   
but i can t let this
go on any further 
why not 
because i don t want to hurt you 
i wouldn t mind 
  no  you don t understand 
  i do understand 
you don t understand 
i know what you re trying to say 
hazel  i m saying i wouldn t mind 
it d be a privilege to have
my heart broken by you 
gus  i m a grenade 
one day i m gonna explode   
and i m gonna obliterate
everything in my wake and   
i don t know  i feel like
it s my responsibility   
to minimize the casualties 
a grenade 
i mean  that s why i
don t have a hamster 
well  we gotta do something
about this frickin  swing set 
okay 
 swing set needs home  
 desperately lonely swing set
 needs loving home  
 lonely  vaguely
pedophilia swing set
 seeks the butts of children  
no  no 
no  no 
i like it 
that s why 
in case you re wondering  that s
why i like you  hazel grace 
you re just so busy
being you  you have
no idea how utterly
unprecedented you are

do you know what dom pérignon said
after he invented champagne 
 come quickly   he said 
 i m tasting the stars  
welcome to oranjee 
would you like a menu  or will
you have the chef s choice 
chef s choice sounds wonderful 
  mmm 
  and  sir  um   
something tells me we re gonna
need a little bit more of this 
we have bottled all the
stars for you this evening 
my young friends 
  ooh 
  i think that s ours 
dragon carrot risotto for the lady 
thank you 
and for the gentleman 
  thank you 
  enjoy 
mmm 
i want this dragon carrot
risotto to become a person   
so that i can take it
to vegas and marry it 
i like your suit 
thank you  it s the first
time i ve ever worn it 
that s not the suit
you wear to funerals 
no 
that one is not nearly this nice 
when i first got sick   
they told me i had an 85 percent
chance of being cancer free 
great odds 
but that meant a year of
torture  the loss of my leg   
and  still  a 15 percent
chance it might fail 
just before the surgery   
i asked my parents if i could
buy a really nice suit 
so  it s your death suit 
that s what it is 
i have one of those  i got it
for my fifteenth birthday 
a dress 
i don t necessarily think i d
wear it on a date  though 
so  we re on a date 
hey  you watch it 
we are mr  and mrs  waters 
oh  that s just because
she can t speak english 
we should be  though  if they ask 
you know 
remember what you said about vegas 
yeah 
do you think i could
join in on that deal 
god 
maybe 
how about angels 
mmm  no 
  afterlife 
  mmm   
no 
well  maybe  i don t know 
i guess i wouldn t go
as far as to say  no    
but i would like some evidence 
what about you 
  absolutely 
  really 
i mean  not like a heaven where
you ride on a unicorn all day   
and live in a mansion
made of clouds   
but yes  i definitely
believe in something 
i mean  otherwise   
what s the point 
maybe there is no point 
i won t accept that 
i am in love with you 
you heard me 
augustus   
i am in love with you 
and i know that love is just
a shout into the void   
and that oblivion is inevitable 
and that we re all doomed   
and that one day   
all of our labors
will be returned to dust 
and i know that
the sun will swallow
the only earth we will ever have 
and i am in love with you 
sorry 
more stars 
no  thank you 
i think we ll just have the check 
no  sir 
your meal has been paid
by mr  van houten 
what 
i don t really get that shirt 
mmm 
but van houten will get it 
there are  like  fifty magritte
references in an imperial affliction 
 this is not a pipe  
but it is a pipe 
but it s not 
it is a drawing of a pipe 
see 
a drawing of a thing
is not the thing itself 
nor is a t shirt of a drawing
of a thing  the thing itself 
hey  you 
when did you get so grown up 
who s ready for some answers 
me 
this is it 
i m so excited 
i can barely breathe 
as opposed to normal 
get out of here 
lidewij 
  hi 
  hi  i m augustus 
  lidewij 
  hazel 
please  come in 
thank you 
peter  they re here 
who the hell is  they   lidewij 
they are augustus and hazel   
the young fans with whom
you ve been corresponding 
the americans 
you invited them 
please  come in 
you know why i left
america  lidewij 
to never have to
encounter americans 
you re american 
incurably so 
get rid of them 
i will not do this  peter 
please  be nice 
come in  please 
sorry  let me clear this for you 
thank you 
which of you is augustus waters 
i am 
and that s hazel 
mr  van houten  thank you so
much for writing back to us 
clearly an error in judgment 
yours are the first missives
to which i ve replied 
and look where it got me 
scotch 
uh   
no  thank you 
just me  then  lidewij 
another scotch and soda  please 
perhaps some
breakfast first  peter 
she thinks i have
a drinking problem 
i also think the earth is round 
so  you like my book 
  we love your book 
  yeah 
we love it 
augustus   
he made his wish meeting
you so that we could talk 
  no pressure 
  yeah 
did you dress like her on purpose 
kind of 
and  incidentally  sir 
we both really
wanted to thank you
for dinner last night 
and for the champagne 
it was amazing 
it was magical 
we bought them dinner last night 
it was our pleasure 
you ve come a long way 
what can i do for you 
we have some questions   
obviously  about what happens
at the end of your book 
uh  specifically to those
who anna leaves behind 
like her mom 
the dutch tulip man   
how familiar are you
with swedish hip hop 
i would say  limited 
uh  lidewij  play
bomfalleralla immediately 
okay 
we don t speak swedish  sir 
who the hell speaks swedish 
the important thing is not what
nonsense the voices are saying   
but what the voices are feeling 
are you messing with us 
like  is this some
sort of performance 
gus  sit down 
all right  so at the end
of the book  anna s   
let s imagine
you re racing a tortoise 
the tortoise has
a ten yard head start 
in the time it takes you
to run ten yards   
the tortoise has moved maybe
one yard  and so on  forever 
you re faster than the tortoise 
but you can never
catch him  you see 
you can only decrease his lead 
now  certainly  you can
run past the tortoise   
as long as you don t contemplate
the mechanics involved 
but the question of  how  
turns out to be so complicated   
that no one really solved it   
until cantor s proof
that some infinities
are bigger than other infinities 
i assume that answers
your question 
hazel  i m sorry  i have
no idea what s going on 
yet you seemed so intelligent
in print  mr  waters 
has the cancer found its
way into your brain 
peter 
can we  for one second 
just focus on anna 
please 
i understand that the story ends
in the middle of a sentence   
because she dies  or that she
becomes too sick to continue   
i am not interested in
talking about that book 
but that doesn t mean that her family
and friends don t have a future  right 
right 
i said i m not interested 
but you promised 
nothing happens  they re fiction 
they cease to exist the
moment the novel ends 
but they can t 
i get it in a literary sense
or whatever  but   
i can t do this  lidewij 
it s impossible
not to imagine what   
i will not indulge
your childish whims 
i refuse to pity you in the manner
in which you are accustomed 
  i do not want your pity 
  of course you do 
like all sick kids  your
existence depends on it 
  you are fated to live out your days   
  peter 
as the child you were
when diagnosed 
a child who believes there is
a life after a novel ends 
and we as adults  we pity this 
so  we pay for your treatments 
your oxygen machines 
peter  that s enough 
you are a side effect
to an evolutionary process   
that cares little
for individual lives 
you are a failed
experiment in mutation 
listen  douchepants   
there is nothing that you re gonna
tell me about my disease   
that i don t already know 
i came here for one thing
and one thing only 
that is for you
to tell me what happens
at the end of this goddamn book 
i can t tell you 
  bullshit 
  i can t 
then make something up 
i want you to leave 
have you ever stopped
to ask yourself   
why you care so much
about your silly questions 
oh  go fuck yourself 
hey  it s okay 
it s okay 
i ll write you a sequel 
all right  i ll write you a sequel 
it ll be better than any piece of
shit that drunk guy could write 
it ll have blood  and
guts  and sacrifice 
you ll love it 
so sorry that i spent your
wish on that asshole 
no  you did not spend it on him 
you spent it on us 
hazel and augustus 
i m very sorry 
circumstance has made him cruel 
i thought meeting you
would help him   
that he could see that his
work has shaped real lives 
but    i m very sorry 
perhaps we can do some sightseeing 
have you been to
the anne frank house 
i m not going anywhere
with that man 
no 
he is not invited 
i m afraid there s no elevator 
oh  that s all right 
there are many stairs 
  steep stairs 
  i can do it 
  hazel  we don t have to   
  i can do it 
let s go 
frank s family came from
frankfurt  in germany 
anne frank s diary would
become world famous 
it s difficult in times like these 
it s a wonder i haven t
abandoned all my ideals 
they seem so absurd
and impractical   
yet i cling to them
because i still believe   
in spite of everything  that
people are truly good at heart 
it s utterly impossible
for me to build my life   
shall we 
  yeah 
  yeah 
hazel  i ll carry it if you want 
i got it 
wow 
so this is the actual bookcase
that hid the frank family 
whoa 
i got it 
thank you 
we re much too young to
deal with these problems   
but they keep thrusting
themselves on us   
until  finally  we re forced
to think up a solution 
you okay  hazel 
yeah 
don t worry  take your time 
sorry 
yeah 
yeah 
and yet  when i look
up at the sky   
i somehow feel that everything
will change for the better 
that this cruelty  too  will end 
you okay 
yeah 
hazel  i think that s enough 
you don t need   
you know 
uh huh 
i got this 
all is as it should be 
god wishes to see people happy 
  where there is hope   
  hazel 
there is life 
  well done 
  yeah 
you okay 
yeah 
this is it  look 
all right 
oh  yeah  oh  my god 
thanks 
the only member of the frank
family to survive was otto 
anne s father 
at such moments   
i can t think about the misery   
but about the beauty
that still remains 
try to recapture the
happiness within yourself 
think of all the beauty
in everything around you   
and be happy 
bravo 
i fell in love with him
the way you fall asleep 
slowly  and then all at once 
it just sort of ends right above
where the knee would be   
and tapers off 
what 
my leg 
you know  just so you re prepared 
gus   
get over yourself 
wait 
i can t  it s stuck 
i love you so much 
augustus waters 
i love you too  hazel grace 
so  so much 
augustus  i can t breathe 
it s okay 
hazel 
you re so beautiful 
stop 
no  you re so beautiful 
i m so lucky 
i m so lucky 
oh  my god 
i can t believe you
called him  douchepants  
  i know 
  you did 
how did you come up with that 
i don t know  it just came out 
i was so angry 
what a monster 
mom  it was awful 
then what happened 
we went to anne frank house 
oh  you did 
  it was really awesome 
  was that incredible 
it was so awesome 
and after that 
we just walked around 
that sounds lovely 
oh  my gosh 
we probably still have
a few hours  right 
should we go to
the van gogh museum 
whatever you want 
probably don t have time
to do everything  but   
you re just gonna have
to come back  is all 
could you just not be
ridiculous right now  please 
hazel  i m not being ridiculous 
i m being positive 
mrs  lancaster 
yeah 
do you think hazel and i can
just have a little time alone 
sure  gus 
um  i am gonna run to the room   
and be ready whenever you
guys want to do something 
want to go for a walk 
what is it 
just before you went into the
hospital  there was this   
i felt an ache in my hip 
so  i had a pet scan   
and it lit up like
a christmas tree 
the lining of my chest
and my liver   
everywhere 
i m sorry 
i should ve told you 
it s so unfair 
apparently  the world is not
a wish granting factory 
hey  listen 
don t you worry about me 
hazel grace  okay 
i m gonna find a way
to hang around here
and annoy you for a long time 
are you in pain 
no 
i m okay 
you re okay 
okay 
i don t suppose you can
just forget about this 
you know  just treat
me like i m not dying 
i don t think you re
dying  augustus 
you ve just got a touch of cancer 
would it be absolutely ludicrous   
if we just made out 
right now 
probably 
oh   
so how are your eyes  isaac

will you tell me a story 
a story 
or  like  a poem 
i do know    i    i know a poem

the red wheelbarrow
by william carlos williams 
 so much depends upon
a red wheelbarrow
 glazed with rain water
 beside the white chickens  
that s it  is that all 
no  no  no  of course not 
of course not 
 so much depends upon   
a blue sky
 cut open by the branches of trees
 and so much depends upon the   
the transparent g tube
 erupting from the belly of
the blue lipped boy
 so much depends
 on this observer of the universe 
how s he doing 
he s had a tough night  hazel 
his blood pressure s low 
his heart   
what about the chemo 
they are gonna stop the chemo 
can i see him 
we ll tell him you were here 
  yeah 
  okay

i m just gonna hang out for
a while  if you don t mind 
yeah  of course 
take your time 
here we go  bud 
  good 
  all right  sweetie 
okay 
hi 
what are you thinking about 
oblivion 
i know it s kid s stuff
or whatever  but   
i always thought i would be a hero 
i always thought i d have
a grand story to tell 
you know  something they would
publish in all the papers  and   
i mean  i was supposed
to be special 
you are special  augustus 
yeah  i know  but   
you know what i mean 
i do know what you mean 
i just don t agree with you 
you know this obsession you
have with being remembered 
  don t get mad 
  i am mad 
i m mad because i think you re
special  and is that not enough 
you think that the only way
to lead a meaningful life   
is for everyone to remember
you  for everyone to love you 
guess what  gus 
this is your life  okay 
this is all you get 
you get me 
and you get your family 
and you get this world 
and that s it 
and if that s not enough for you 
then i m sorry 
but it s not nothing 
because i love you 
and i m gonna remember you 
i m sorry  you re right 
i just wish you
would be happy with that 
hey 
it s a good life  hazel grace 
it s not over yet  you know 
oh  augustus 
one of the less bullshitty
conventions of the cancer genre   
is the convention known as
the  last good day    
when it seems like the inexorable
decline has suddenly plateaued   
when the pain is 
just for a minute  bearable 
the problem  of course  is that
there s no way of knowing   
that your last good day
is your last good day 
at the time  it s just
another decent day 
hello  augustus 
good evening  hazel grace 
a quick question for you 
did you ever write that eulogy
i asked you to prepare 
i may have 
do you think you could
find your way down   
to the literal heart of jesus
in the next few minutes 
maybe  is everything okay 
i love you  hazel grace 
  can i have the keys 
  oh 
  where you going  we re gonna eat something 
  i have to go 
hazel  you have to be hungry 
you didn t even eat lunch 
i m just not hungry 
hazel  you cannot not eat 
i m aggressively un hungry 
hazel  i know gus is sick  but you
got to take care of yourself 
this has nothing to do with gus 
well  then you ve
got to stay healthy 
come on  just eat something  honey 
 stay healthy  
okay  i m not healthy 
and i m gonna die 
do you realize that  i m dying 
and you re gonna be here   
and you re not gonna have anyone
to look after  or hover around   
and you re not gonna be a mother
anymore  and i m sorry   
but there s nothing
i can do about that 
so  can i please go 
why would you say that to me 
because you said that 
what are you talking about 
in the icu 
hazel   
that s not the truth 
i was wrong 
all right 
even if you died   
 when  
even when you die   
i ll always be your mother 
it s the greatest
thing i ll ever be 
that is my biggest fear  mom 
when i am gone   
you re not gonna
have a life anymore 
you re just gonna sit and
you re gonna stare at walls   
or you re gonna
off yourselves or   
hazel  honey 
we re not gonna do that 
losing you   
that is gonna hurt like hell 
but you of all people know it s
possible to live with pain 
you just do it 
i m taking classes in social work 
wait  you re what 
yeah  um   
you know  if i can take
what we ve been through   
and help other people 
maybe counsel families   
mom  how could you
not tell me this 
we didn t want you
to feel abandoned 
feel abandoned 
you guys  this is   
this is the best news 
you go 
okay 
baby 
straight ahead  yeah 
to your left  a little bit 
that s a step  right 
yeah  put your hand out 
there s a podium to your right 
yeah  perfect 
beautiful 
hi 
you re late 
how you doing  you look
ravishing  hazel grace 
i know  right 
what s going on  guys 
tell her  gus 
i wanted to attend my own funeral 
i mean  i m hopeful that i ll be
able to attend as a ghost  but   
however  just in case
it doesn t work out   
i decided to plan this pre funeral 
ready 
augustus waters was a
cocky son of a bitch 
but we forgave him 
not because of his
superhuman good looks   
or because he only got 19 years
when he should ve gotten way more 
18 years  buddy 
dude  come on  really 
i m assuming you have a little more
time  you interrupting bastard 
interrupt me in the middle of my eulogy 
you re supposed to be dead 
but when the scientists
from the future   
come to my house with robot eyes   
and they tell me to try them on   
i m gonna tell those scientists
to piss off  because   
because gus  i don t even want
to see a world without you 
i don t 
i don t want to see a world
without augustus waters 
then  having made my point  i ll
probably put the robot eyes on   
because  you know 
they re robot eyes 
sounds awesome 
and i don t know    um   
this is just so hard 
um   
godspeed 
yeah 
hazel  can i get a hand here 
to the right  a little bit 
yeah  and turn around 
sit down  there you go 
it s down to you  hazel grace 
hello 
my name is hazel grace lancaster   
and augustus waters was the
star crossed love of my life 
ours was an epic love story   
and i probably won t be able to
get more than a sentence out   
without disappearing
into a puddle of tears 
like all real love stories   
ours will die with us 
as it should 
you know  i d kind of hoped that
he would be the one eulogizing me 
because there s really
no one else   
yeah  no  um   
i m not gonna talk about our
love story  because i can t 
so  instead 
i m gonna talk about math 
i am not a mathematician 
but i do know this 
there are infinite numbers
between zero and one 
there s point one  point one two 
and point one one two  and   
and an infinite
collection of others 
of course 
there is a bigger infinite
set of numbers
between zero and two   
or between zero and a million 
some infinities are simply
bigger than other infinities 
a writer that we used
to like taught us that 
you know  i want more numbers   
than i m likely to get 
and  god   
do i want more days
for augustus waters
than what he got 
but  gus   
my love   
i cannot tell you
how thankful i am   
for our little infinity 
hold on 
you gave me a forever   
within the numbered days 
and for that  i am   
i am eternally grateful 
i love you so much 
i love you  too 
augustus waters died eight
days later in the icu 
when the cancer 
which was made of him   
stopped his heart  which
was also made of him 
it was unbearable 
the whole thing 
every second  worse than the last 
one of the first things
they ask you in the er   
is to rate your pain
on a scale from one to ten 
i ve been asked this question
hundreds of times   
and i remember once   
when i couldn t catch my breath
and it felt like
my chest was on fire   
the nurse asked me
to rate the pain 
though i couldn t speak 
i held up nine fingers 
later  when i started
feeling better   
the nurse came in
and she called me a fighter 
 you know how i know  
she said 
 you called a ten a nine  
but that wasn t the truth 
i didn t call it a nine
because i was brave 
the reason i called it a nine was
because i was saving my ten 
and this was it 
this was the great
and terrible ten 
 i will fear no evil 
for you are with me   
 your rod and your staff 
they comfort me 
 you prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies 
 you anoint my head with oil 
my cup overflows 
 surely  goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life   
 and i will dwell
in the house of the lord   
 forever  
augustus waters
fought hard for many years 
his battle was a courageous
one  and his strength   
what a load of shit  huh  kid 
was a source of inspiration
for each and every one of us 
let us pray 
we thank you  lord  for the
life of augustus waters   
we need to fake pray now 
   for his strength
and his courage 
lord  we ask that you be with
us today  that you be close   
that you comfort
his friends and family 
thank you for your presence  lord 
all this we pray in jesus  name 
amen 
amen 
now  we are going to hear
from gus  special friend   
hazel lancaster 
not that it really matters 
but i was his girlfriend 
there s a beautiful quote
in gus  home that reads   
 if you want the rainbow  you
have to deal with the rain  
even in his last few days   
um   
i didn t believe a word 
he was always able
to crack a smile 
but that s okay 
i knew this was
the right thing to do 
funerals  i d decided 
are not for the dead 
they re for the living 
hey  want some company 
no  i m okay 
i m just gonna drive
for a bit by myself 
love you 
love you 
you spoke beautifully 
i ll see you soon 
drive safe 
okay 
may i 
omnis cellula e cellula 
your boy waters and i corresponded
quite a bit in his last days 
oh  so  you read your fan mail now 
i wouldn t exactly call him a fan 
he detested me 
but he was quite insistent
i attend his funeral   
and tell you what became
of anna and her mother   
so here i am 
and that s your answer 
 omnis cellula e cellula  
 life comes from life  
i m really not in the mood 
you don t want an explanation 
no  i don t 
thank you  though 
have a great life 
you remind me of her 
i remind a lot of people
of a lot of people 
my daughter was eight 
and she suffered
beautifully for so long 
she had leukemia like anna 
just like anna 
i m very sorry for your loss 
and i m sorry for yours  and
sorry for ruining your trip 
you didn t ruin our trip 
we had an amazing trip 
are you familiar with
the trolley problem 
there s a thought experiment
in the field of ethics   
known as the trolley problem 
philippa foot was an
english philosopher   
oh  my god 
hazel  i m trying to
explain something to you 
i m trying to give you
what you wanted 
no  you re not 
you are a drunk 
and you re a failure   
and i need you to get out
of my car right now   
so that i can go home  and
be by myself and grieve 
you ll want to read this 
i don t want to read anything 
can you just get out of my car 
please get out of my car 
fine 
can i come in 
i m so  so sorry 
yeah 
it was a privilege 
though  wasn t it 
to love him 
gives you an idea
how we feel about you 
hazel 
there s a friend here to see you 
do you know if it hurt or whatever 
apparently he was struggling
for breath for a long time   
and then eventually
he just went unconscious 
it wasn t great or anything 
dying sucks 
gus really loved you  you know 
i know 
he wouldn t shut up about it 
yeah 
it was annoying  he
talked about you so much 
i didn t find it that annoying 
i know  i know you didn t 
did you get that letter
from your author friend 
ew  he s not my friend 
how do you know about that 
well  i was talking
to him at the cemetery   
and he said he came all this way
to give that letter to you 
yeah  well  i m over it 
i have no interest in reading another
word of that asshole s again 
no  he didn t write it 
gus wrote it 
what 
apparently gus wrote something down
and then sent it to van houten 
oh  my god 
mr  van houten  i m a good
person  but a shitty writer 
you re a shitty person 
but a good writer 
i think we d make a good team 
i don t want to ask you
for any favors   
but if you have the time  and from
what i saw  you have plenty   
please fix this for me 
it s a eulogy for hazel 
she asked me to write one 
and i m trying 
i just    i could
use a little flair 
see  the thing is  we all
want to be remembered 
but hazel s different 
hazel knows the truth 
she didn t want a million admirers 
she just wanted one 
and she got it 
maybe she wasn t loved widely 
but she was loved deeply 
and isn t that more
than most of us get 
when hazel was sick 
i knew i was dying   
but i didn t want to say so 
she was in the icu  and i
snuck in for 10 minutes   
and i sat with her 
before i got caught 
her eyes were closed 
her skin  pale 
but her hands
were still her hands 
still warm  and her nails were painted
this dark blue black color   
and i just held them 
and i willed myself to imagine
a world without us   
and what a worthless world
that would be 
she s so beautiful 
you don t get tired
of looking at her 
you never worry if she s
smarter than you   
because you know she is 
she s funny without
ever being mean 
i love her 
god  i love her 
i m so lucky to love her 
van houten 
you don t get to choose if
you get hurt in this world   
but you do have a say
