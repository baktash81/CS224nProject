he didn t want to do it  he said he
didn t want to ruin what we had   
by deflowering ourselves

hurt to get a little rowdy this weekend 
jim s got single friends

  oh  finch is boneable 
yes  he is boneable 
dickhead  you do not send shit

coach marshall when he read it

me to dance like you did in the gay bar  
i put serious thought
into that letter

i just don t feel quite like a virgin in it 
oh

room in my brain for everything 
there s always room for
plato and aristotle 
some of my favourites

and  oh    oh  oh 
oh  oh  oh

oh  boy  let s go look at
the candelabrum  honey 
i think with the summer blossoms 
mm hmm 
cutie 
thank you for everything 
what do you think  girls 
isn t this adorable  bye  cadence 
okay  i know    i know what you re doing

like a  baryshiniankov  
oh  yeah 
he is pretty good 
jim  he s not doing it to be nice 
he s doing it to bone cadence 
look  maybe we should give him a chance 
you know  i think    i think   
that underneath all the fucks
and shits and blow mes 
there s a very sensitive person
who is just thirsty for acceptance 
that s that s what i think 
oh  jim  you ve gotta stop masturbating 
it s melting your brain 
observe the fuckin  stif meister 
what is his defining characteristic 
he uses the f word excessively 
thanks  man 
but i also have confidence 
you re one big floppy cock 
look at you 
you ve gotta stand like a man 
your posture tells your partner
where to go 
okay  okay 
okay 
follow my lead 
this is the waltz 
waltz  okay 
waltz  okay 
that s pretty good 
you re fuckin  right it s good 
i m gonna save your ass
in this wedding 
pretty soon you re gonna
want me to shave your balls 
should i shave my balls  do you shave
your balls  how do you do it 
dude  no 
l    l    i m just   
shaving 
you know  there s nothing like
a local pub 
mm hmm 
it s like real america   
without all that corporateness and catchy jingles 
well  what s wrong with a good jingle 
i think it was voltaire who said 
 a jingle witty proves everything
for my friends and i  
  cadence 
i didn t know you were gonna be here 
you re just in time
for voltaire s greatest hits 
voltaire 
stifler  please  who was voltaire 
someone much wiser than you 
i m afraid  finch 
actually  i m getting a little burned out
on all the intellectual stuff 
yeah  me too 
being smart is so hard 
i ll give you some intelligence 
voltaire can suck on my balls 
what 
it s about time somebody
finally came out and said it 
hey  i m gonna give you a quote to live by 
 love life  get paid and then get laid  
that is the basic philosophy
of the finch meister 
i like that 
  bet you do 
  but i don t know why you do   
because finch meister doesn t
make any friggin  sense 
  sure  it does 
  no fuckin  shit it does 
cadence  let s leave
the  crayton  here  shall we 
whatever  fuck it 
i m walkin  anyway 
wait  you know  actually  i think i m gonna
go stretch my legs with the finch meister 
  you don t mind  do you  steven 
  no 
ha 
it s on like donkey kong  bi i itch 
pack it up  bitch 
i m on it  thank you 
so  uh  cadence say
anything about me 
whatever you and finch are pulling 
she seems to like you both 
finch  is she gonna be
around tomorrow night 
no  she s going up to chicago
with michelle for the final dress fitting 
what about her parents 
i think her mom kind of likes me 
they re going up north with 
uh    with my parents   
for  uh    you know  to get things  uh 
ready for the rehearsal 
so  uh   
so that s where they ll be 
so don t bother looking for them or anything 
you know 
a wedding 
shit  how do you know
she s the right girl 
i just do 
i m a better person when i m with michelle 
nobody else can    no  no  no  shithead 
you hooked up with one other girl for 
what  10 seconds 
not to mention you passed on nadia 
dumbest fuckin  thing ever 
you re like a blind man picking
out his favourite porno 
this shit is crazy 
this is just the old pre wedding jitters 
son 
it s so forever  you know  it it s  uh   
you know  michelle is the only  uh 
girl that i ve    i ve been with 
honestly  now    honestly  would you
have passed up sex with nadia 
why  did she say something 
hypothetically  dad 
oh  hypothetically 
well  i mean  you know 
jim  i m a married man 
i m   
if lf lf you weren t married 
she s a college girl 
if you were a college guy 
in a heartbeat 
oh  yeah  mm hmm 
first of all  what what you re feeling is
so normal and perfectly natural 
marriage is not about  uh  animal lusting
and and kinky sex games 
it s not so much about who s the dog
and who s the fire hydrant tonight 
it s it s deeper than that 
the longer a marriage lasts 
uh  the longer you can go 
uh  without sex 
but when that magic night
does happen  uh 
it s it s all the more meaningful 
and let me tell you 
your mother  bless her 
can still make me  uh 
squeal like a pig 
uh  and i mean that in the good sense  son 
do you follow what i m saying 
you understand where i m going 
i do  i  uh    i think i  uh   
anything else you need 
no  no  that s  uh   
anything i can do 
he s not here  park the cars down
there where he won t see them 
hoo  fuckin  right 
so  you like my pants  stiffy  whatever 
dude  as long as the girls are worth it 
they re worth it  oh  and if you ve got some
good wine too  that ll score some points for you

you could have told me
she was behind me 
between grandma and stifler and cadence

i thought i had grown out of this   
sort of behaviour  but i keep messing up 
these things keep happening to me 
and if i can t bring it
together for one day 
how am i gonna hold it together
for the rest of our lives 
i m really afraid that this is
how it s always gonna be

to get yourself into serious shit 
and somehow you always come out
of it better than you went in 
i don t know how  but you do 
everything is gonna be fine 
yeah  um  uh  you need to
come into the kitchen right now 
there s    yeah 
jesus  now what 
there is no way to remake
all these in time  is there 
something must have
disrupted the power 
the compressors need time to reset
after a power loss  or they overheat 
essentially  it turns the refrigerator
into an oven 
stifler was in here earlier
flipping switches 
michelle  i am so sorry 
hey 
ooh  those flowers
look hideous 
that s  cause you killed them 
stifler

well  you get an  a  for effort 
this is amazing 
cool 
i was always kind of
a  c  student

just to have sex with me   
or because you really care
about the wedding 
both 
and  uh   
i like you 
what 
i like you 
well  that s an honest answer 
i gotta go 
steve stifler just gave
a rose to a girl and meant it 
this is huge  it s    it s like watching
monkeys use tools for the first time 
you still pissed
about me and cadence 
you still pissed
about me and cadence 
no  let s see 
she wasn t into the heavy intellectual
stuff 
she actually liked me
being that imbecile 
no  no  somehow i think
she s probably better off with you 
thanks  shit brick 
ooh  dick 
fucking hate not hating you 
i did fuck your mom 
twice 
ooh  that s better  fucker 
oh  whoa 
ready to go 
um  the wedding s
not for another hour 
no  i mean you and me 
hold on  hold on 
do i still gotta do
this bullshit meeting 
stifler  you are not
bailing on jim 
shit 
give me 10 minutes 
i ll meet you at the closet 
the closet 
you wanted to see me 
michelle 
oh  okay  sit 
so  uh  jim said that you ve always
kind of been there for him   
when he needed you  so i thought
maybe you could help me 
jim said that 
what s  uh   
what s the problem 
okay  well  i  uh   
i still can t get
my vows right 
oh  i haven t been this confused
since i got my first period 
that s a very confusing time
for any young lady 
you know  your body
is going through  uh  changes 
um  stuff coming out 
stuff going in 
oh  no  i need help with my vows 
not my period 
oh  your vows 
your vows 
yes  uh  good 
um  go on 
jim just wants a groomsmen s meeting
before the wedding 
it shouldn t take long 
just don t let her talk to anyone 
be careful 
she s feisty 
okay  let s go 
hey  guys  thanks for coming out
here and meeting me 
i  um    i just have a couple of things
i wanna say 
this sucks 
did i say that out loud 
keep going 
it s good 
now  i thought about
what you said  kev 
about  uh  about how my problems
always seem to work out 
and i realized that the reason
things always work out   
is because you guys have always
been there to back me up 
even you  stifler 
for the first time in my life   
i actually feel like
i can t mess anything up 
which is pretty amazing 
so  uh 
l i guess i just wanted
to say thank you 
thanks  yeah 
thanks 
this whole thing
was about thanks 
ooh  you re welcome 
cock block 
that was good  jim 
real nice 
let s get you married 
hmm 
okay 
love is very difficult
to describe 
and i understand the angst 
i mean  it s your wedding 
and it s natural 
it s perfectly natural 
but it s impossible
to describe a feeling 
okay  first 
nothing is impossible 
so  let s not focus
on that 
why do you think  michelle 
they call it  making love  
i don t know 
i just call it  boneing  
boneing 
well  when you re doing
other things with jim   
when you re not 
um  boneing   
how does
he make you feel 
horny  like i wanna bone 
but we can t be boneing
from sunrise to sunset  dear 
oh  you ve never tried it 
i certainly have 
i have  i ve boned 
from sunrise right through brunch 
on more than one occasion 
but boneing aside  um  i think they call it
 making love    
because you have to
make love work 
you know 
it s about compromise and sacrifice 
and i think jim
has sacrificed for you 
my god  he shaved
his entire pubic region 
which would baffle most
cultures around the world 
but he did it 
and he did it for you 
you re right 
love isn t just a feeling 
it s shaving your balls 
thanks  dad 
i wouldn t get into too much detail
on that 
excuse me  pardon me 
excuse me 
oh  yeah  excuse me 
pardon me  pardon me 
gonna have sex with cadence
uh huh 
you know  son  i think this is probably
the right time to tell you that   
that   
i know  dad 
i can t see anything here 
oh  there you are 
guys  what are you doing 
where s jim s grandma 
the old bitch sucked 
we had to ditch her 
you what 
don t worry 
we put her someplace
no one will find her 
cadence  where are you going 
oh  mom 
oh  baby 
i m so ready for this 
your body s not quite what i was
expecting  but that s okay 
the stif man digs
what s underneath 
oh  you are so beautiful 
oh  i just wanna   
stifler   granny  
granny  what 
focus  focus  focus 
out

  shut the fucking door

on my mother s face

waiting for a day like this

i love you

jim 
i had trouble finding the words
to tell you how i feel 
and i realized something 
love isn t just a feeling

it s a dress

a special haircut 
jim  you ve given me
everything i ve ever wanted 
and it is my solemn vow   
to give everything i am to you 
james emanuel levenstein
