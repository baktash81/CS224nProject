so the brass decided to reward you
with a little appointment
to the california sun
have a walnut boyd
martha brought them in fresh
from san miguel
this is my hobby
reading in the original languages
well you know languages in general
its tedious i know
but then this place thrives
on tedium
so
you have a hobby boyd
swimming
swimming
i hope you dont mind hard water
fort spencer
the spanish built this place
as a mission
we inherited her now were
a weigh station
for travelers on their way
through the nevadas
we dont get much traffic
here in the winter
so we maintain a skeleton company
that consists of private toffler
whos our personal emissary
from the lord
major knox who never met a bottle
he didnt like
private reich hes our soldier
id steer clear of him
and martha youve met i bet you
didnt get a word out of her
and george her brother
theyre both locals and sort of
came with the place
and then theres private cleaves
the overmedicated private cleaves
and you and i make eight
cleaves cooks knox used to be
a veterinarian so he plays doctor
my advice to you is dont get sick
id say dont eat
but then most of us have to
so with your promotion youd be
number three in command
tofflers prayer
o heavenly father
bless these to our use
amen
amen
so did anyone do anything today
we have a great sense of camaraderie
here at fort spencer
man 1
howd you get behind the enemy line
boyd
i froze i was scared
man 1
scared
you froze while the rest
of your unit fought
and died
man 2
what did you do then
boyd
i played dead
man 1
but you made it behind enemy lines
boyd
i was buried
with my commanding officers
halfshotoff head in my face
his blood running down my throat
coughs
man 2
so how did you take the command post
boyd
something
something had changed
gunfire
men speaking in spanish
man 2 were gonna promote you boyd
we could shoot you
but as you captured the enemy
command it might set a bad precedent
hart

cowardice
knox has got some excellent bourbon

a minute ago

would like to
he wont mind
probably
to escape
in one form or another
toffler
toffler
what are you doing
its a religious hymn
im writing a religious hymn
well could you find some inspiration
somewhere else
and could you get us some ice
funny thing
we escape the world
we come here
and then we turn right around
and try to escape this place
the frightening thing
about escape though
the chance you might end up
someplace worse
he was here

fort spencer california
western sierra nevadas
excuse me
im sorry
my names colqhoun
fw colqhoun servant of god
how are you feeling mr colqhoun
not bad considering
probably look like death
hart
not bad considering
how long were you out there
three months
without food
yes
toffler help him
colqhoun good lord
good lord
you should have seen me
three months ago
i was 30 pounds heavier
im sorry but you did say
no food for three months
i said no food i didnt say
there was nothing to eat understand
do you understand
i suppose i owe you gentlemen a story
hart
only if you feel up to it
yes
we left in april
six of us in all
mr maccready and his wife
from lreland
mr janus from virginia i believe
with his servant jones
myself im from scotland
and our guide
a military man coincidentally
a colonel lves
i dont think i know him
the better for you
a detestable man
the most disastrous guide
he professed to know
a new shorter route
through the nevadas
quite a route that was
longer than the known one
and impossible to travel
we worked very very hard
by the first snow we were 1 00 miles
from this place that was november
proceeding in the snow was futile
we took shelter in a cave
decided to wait until
the storm had passed
but the storm did not pass
the trail soon became impassable
and we had run out of food
we ate the oxen
all the horses
even my own dog
and that lasted us about a month
after that we turned to our belts
shoes
any roots we could dig up
but you know
theres no real
nourishment in those
we remained famished
the day that jones died
i was out collecting wood
he had expired from malnourishment
when i returned the others were
cooking his legs for dinner
would i have stopped it
had i been there
i dont know
but i must say
when i stepped inside that cave
the smell of meat cooking
i thanked the lord
i thanked the lord
and then things got out of hand
i ate sparingly
others did not
the meat did not last us a week
and we were soon hungry again
only this time our hunger
was different
more severe
savage
and colonel lves particularly
could not be satisfied
janus was the first to be killed
and then mr maccready
that left colonel lves
maccreadys wife and i alone
and i knew in that company
that my days were numbered
im ashamed to say that i acted
in a most cowardly manner
it wouldve been nobler to stay and
protect mrs maccready from lves
but i was weak
i fled
it was nothing less than pure
providence that i arrived here
mrs maccready is she still there
and colonel lves as far as i know
lets pack up
weve got to go up there
weve got to go its our job
toffler why go
hart its our job
heres for you heres toffler
reich has got his own rifle
and ive got my pistol
i think the caves three
or four days march from here
what is it george
what
george windigo
hart windigo
windigo
speaks in native language
hart
its an old lndian myth from the north
a man eats anothers flesh
usually an enemy
and he takes steals
his strength his essence
his spirit
and his hunger becomes craven
insatiable
and the more he eats
the more he wants to
and the more he eats
the stronger he becomes
george people dont still do that
do they
white man eats the body of
jesus christ every sunday
line them up
major knox were leaving now
youll be in charge until i return
heres the key to the arsenal
martha and cleaves will be back

theres no sign of anyone
no sign of a sign of anyone
not colonel harts rescue party
not the original party
you found the cave
theres nothing in there
theres nothing inside
theres no blood tracks
no rope no bodies
you dont believe me sir
we have four missing soldiers
and no bodies we need
a supportable explanation
now your story this windigy
is the stuff of campfires
would you stop squirming lindus
i know i mispronounced it
im making a point
my point is captain we need facts
not myths
i told you the facts sir
if you altered your story it wouldnt
be perceived as retracting a lie
only clarifying
a muddled recollection
on the day that we spoke to you
you were out of your head with fear
i was coherent then
i am coherent now sir
i remember
perhaps in the wilderness
you got separated
from your company
thats why im giving you
this second opportunity
id advise that
you change your story boyd
whos that
new colonel
knox
well go inside and get some warmth
knocking
yes
sir the colonels here
thank you lindus
we brought in an interim officer
until we can
appoint a permanent replacement
for colonel hart
captain this is colonel lves
colonel captain boyd
hows the leg
lindus
lets step outside
what is the matter with you
captain boyd
its him
its who
its him sir
who is
hes colqhoun sir
colonel lves is
hes the one
that killed them all sir
are you mad
let major knox look at him sir
major knox was here
major knox
let major knox look at him sir
major knox
major knox
knox
he doesnt look familiar to me sir
i do remember the man wore a beard
but as i was saying sir
i was feeling a bit ill that day
you were drunk
captain please
boyd you say you fired
on this colqhoun
struck him in the shoulder
that would leave a wound
now wouldnt it
i presume so
well why dont we check
colonel lves
would you humor me a moment
of course sir
would you
would you take off your shirt
please and show me your shoulder
please colonel
please
well l
my last physical examination was
not that long ago
surely major knox has no desire
to hear me cough
the other shoulder please colonel
thank you colonel
not at all
is there a problem
slauson not with you colonel
general we should leave now
in order to avoid the storm
thunder rumbles
boyd told the general
colonel lves killed everyone
martha
what
he said colonel lves
was the man responsible
boyd gone loco
i think hes the reason
nobody come back
i have to warn you
yeah captain
consider yourselves warned
do you need this
no sir
good
knox
youre not an eater of ribs colonel
no no major i
can never forget it
used to be an animal
sentimental fellow
captain you dont eat meat
knox
oh no he wont
only as a last resort
thats a pity
boyd no
cleaves laughs
damn
checkmate
well well
it appears a number of us
could use some rest
go on to bed boyd
colqhoun
clearing up
i found your private reich up there
what was left you didnt finish
well i cant blame you
he was tough
but then
a good soldier ought to be
you know not long ago
i couldnt do that
i could barely take a breath
without coughing up a pint of blood
tuberculosis
that along with
fierce headaches
depression
suicidal ambition
i was in pretty horrible shape
in fact
i was on my way to a sanitorium
to convalesce more likely to die
when en route
this lndian scout told me
a curious story
a man eats the flesh of another
he steals his strength
he absorbs
the other mans spirit
well
i just had to try
consequently i ate the scout first
and he was absolutely right
i grew
stronger
later my wagon train
grew lost in the rockies
ive heard this story before
i ate five men in three months
tuberculosis
vanished
as did the black thoughts
i reached the end
of that spring feeling
happy
and healthy
and virile
did you eat her too
as a matter of fact
youre disgusting
one year later
i feel more alive than ever before
thats what surprises me
about you boyd
youve tasted it
felt its power
yet youre resisting
why
because its wrong
morality
the last bastion
of a coward
im sorry
im sorry
did i offend you
remember this
you smell it
scent always jogs the memory
dont you think
remember the energy
the potency of someone else coursing
through your veins
someone brave
knowing the disappointment
as it dissipates
the strength
slipping from your grasp
growing
killing need to replenish
i dont have to remind you of that
you feel it right now
i am gonna kill you
he die you die
what in the heck is going on out here
colqhoun

ives was feeding me
by the time i regained my senses

to resist me boyd
its courage to accept me
