war hero  huh 
so the brass decided to reward you     
     with a little appointment
to the california sun 
have a walnut  boyd 
martha brought them in fresh
from san miguel 
this is my hobby 
reading in the original languages 
well  you know  languages in general 
it s tedious  i know     
     but then this place thrives
on tedium 
so       
you have a hobby  boyd 
swimming 
swimming 
i hope you don t mind hard water 
fort spencer 
the spanish built this place
as a mission 
we inherited her  now we re
a weigh station     
     for travelers on their way
through the nevadas 
we don t get much traffic
here in the winter     
     so we maintain a skeleton company
that consists of private toffler     
     who s our personal emissary
from the lord 
major knox  who never met a bottle
he didn t like 
private reich  he s our soldier 
i d steer clear of him 
and martha  you ve met  i bet you
didn t get a word out of her 
and george  her brother 
they re both locals and sort of
came with the place 
and then there s private cleaves 
the over medicated private cleaves 
and you and i make eight 
cleaves cooks  knox used to be
a veterinarian  so he plays doctor 
my advice to you is  don t get sick 
i d say don t eat 
but then most of us have to 
so with your promotion  you d be
number three in command 
toffler s prayer 
o  heavenly father 
bless these to our use       
 amen 
 amen 
so  did anyone do anything today 
we have a great sense of camaraderie
here at fort spencer 
man 1  
how d you get behind the enemy line 
boyd 
i froze  i was scared 
man 1  
scared 
you froze while the rest
of your unit fought   
   and died 
man 2 
what did you do then 
boyd 
i played dead 
man 1  
but you made it behind enemy lines 
boyd 
i was buried   
    with my commanding officer s
half shot off head in my face 
his blood running down my throat 
 coughs 
man 2 
so how did you take the command post 
boyd 
something    
something had changed 
 gunfire 
 men speaking in spanish 
man 2  we re gonna promote you  boyd 
we could shoot you   
   but as you captured the enemy
command  it might set a bad precedent 
hart 
whoa  whoa  whoa

what did you get the medal for 
cowardice 
knox has got some excellent bourbon 
it s really fine stuff 
and he just passed out about     
     a minute ago 
so i m wondering if you
would like to      
 he won t mind 
 probably 
to escape 
in one form or another 
toffler 
toffler 
what are you doing 
it s a religious hymn 
i m writing a religious hymn 
well  could you find some inspiration
somewhere else 
and could you get us some ice 
funny thing 
we escape the world 
we come here     
     and then we turn right around
and try to escape this place 
the frightening thing
about escape  though     
     the chance you might end up
someplace worse 
he was here 
reich  go that way 
 colonel 
 yeah 
who are you 
reich  reich 
 he s alive 
reich  jesus christ 
hart  just barely 
let s get him inside 
we need hot water 
george  toffler  hot water 
lots of hot water 
reich  go rouse knox 
let s get those rags off him 
see if we can get his blood moving 
toffler  more water 
hart 
i think he ll live 
easy  easy  easy  blanket 
well  he s warm 
frostbite didn t seem
to do much damage 
i guess the only thing we can do
is let him rest 
and pray  toffler  your duty 
good work 
each one of these squares
is 1 mile by 1  5 miles 
it takes about three days  actually

fort spencer  california 
western sierra nevadas 
excuse me 
i m sorry 
my name s colqhoun 
f w  colqhoun  servant of god 
how are you feeling  mr  colqhoun 
not bad  considering 
probably look like death 
hart 
not bad  considering 
how long were you out there 
three months 
 without food 
 yes 
 toffler  help him 
colqhoun  good lord 
good lord 
you should have seen me
three months ago 
i was 30 pounds heavier 
i m sorry  but you did say
no food for three months 
i said no food  i didn t say
there was nothing to eat  understand 
do you understand 
i suppose i owe you gentlemen a story 
hart 
only if you feel up to it 
yes 
we left in april 
six of us in all 
mr  maccready and his wife
from lreland 
mr  janus  from virginia  i believe   
    with his servant  jones 
myself  i m from scotland 
and our guide     
     a military man  coincidentally 
a colonel lves 
i don t think i know him 
the better for you 
a detestable man 
the most disastrous guide 
he professed to know     
     a new  shorter route
through the nevadas 
quite a route that was 
longer than the known one   
   and impossible to travel 
we worked very  very hard 
by the first snow  we were 1 00 miles
from this place  that was november 
proceeding in the snow was futile 
we took shelter in a cave 
decided to wait until
the storm had passed 
but the storm did not pass 
the trail soon became impassable   
     and we had run out of food 
we ate the oxen     
     all the horses     
     even my own dog 
and that lasted us about a month 
after that we turned to our belts 
shoes 
any roots we could dig up 
but you know     
     there s no real
nourishment in those 
we remained famished 
the day that jones died 
i was out collecting wood 
he had expired from malnourishment 
when i returned  the others were
cooking his legs for dinner 
would i have stopped it
had i been there 
i don t know 
but i must say     
     when i stepped inside that cave     
     the smell of meat cooking       
i thanked the lord 
i thanked the lord 
and then things got out of hand 
i ate sparingly 
others did not 
the meat did not last us a week 
and we were soon hungry again 
only this time our hunger
was different 
more severe 
savage 
and colonel lves  particularly 
could not be satisfied 
janus was the first to be killed 
and then mr  maccready 
that left colonel lves 
maccready s wife and i alone 
and i knew in that company
that my days were numbered 
i m ashamed to say that i acted
in a most cowardly manner 
it would ve been nobler to stay and
protect mrs  maccready from lves     
     but i was weak 
i fled 
it was nothing less than pure
providence that i arrived here 
mrs  maccready  is she still there 
and colonel lves  as far as i know 
let s pack up 
we ve got to go up there 
we ve got to go  it s our job 
toffler  why go 
hart  it s our job 
here s for you  here s toffler 
reich has got his own rifle
and i ve got my pistol 
i think the cave s three
or four days  march from here 
what is it  george 
what 
george  windigo 
hart  windigo 
windigo 
 speaks in native language 
hart 
it s an old lndian myth from the north 
a man eats another s flesh     
     usually an enemy 
and he takes   steals     
     his strength  his essence 
his spirit 
and his hunger becomes craven 
insatiable 
and the more he eats 
the more he wants to 
and the more he eats 
the stronger he becomes 
george  people don t still do that 
do they 
white man eats the body of
jesus christ every sunday 
line them up 
major knox  we re leaving now 
you ll be in charge until i return 
here s the key to the arsenal 
martha and cleaves will be back

windigo eats

he takes  never  never gives 
you start windigo 
you give yourself 
you must die 
there s no sign of anyone 
no sign of a sign of anyone 
not colonel hart s rescue party 
not the original party 
 you found the cave 
 there s nothing in there 
there s nothing inside 
there s no blood tracks 
no rope  no bodies 
 you don t believe me  sir 
 we have four missing soldiers     
     and no bodies  we need
a supportable explanation 
now  your story  this  windigy 
is the stuff of campfires 
would you stop squirming  lindus 
i know i mispronounced it 
i m making a point 
my point is  captain  we need facts 
not myths 
i told you the facts  sir 
if you altered your story  it wouldn t
be perceived as retracting a lie 
only clarifying     
     a muddled recollection 
on the day that we spoke to you 
you were out of your head with fear 
i was coherent then 
i am coherent now  sir 
 i remember  
 perhaps in the wilderness     
     you got separated
from your company 
that s why i m giving you
this second opportunity 
i d advise that     
     you change your story  boyd 
 who s that 
 new colonel 
knox 
we ll go inside and get some warmth 
 knocking 
yes 
 sir  the colonel s here 
 thank you  lindus 
we brought in an interim officer
until we can     
     appoint a permanent replacement
for colonel hart 
captain  this is colonel lves 
colonel  captain boyd 
how s the leg 
lindus 
let s step outside 
what is the matter with you 
captain boyd 
 it s him 
 it s who 
 it s him  sir 
 who is 
 he s colqhoun  sir 
 colonel lves is       
he s the one
that killed them all  sir 
 are you mad 
 let major knox look at him  sir 
 major knox was here 
 major knox 
 let major knox look at him  sir 
 major knox 
major knox 
knox 
he doesn t look familiar to me  sir 
i do remember the man wore a beard 
but as i was saying  sir     
     i was feeling a bit ill that day 
 you were drunk 
 captain  please 
boyd  you say you fired
on this colqhoun 
struck him in the shoulder 
that would leave a wound 
now  wouldn t it 
i presume so 
well  why don t we check 
colonel lves     
      would you humor me a moment 
 of course  sir 
would you      
would you take off your shirt 
please  and show me your shoulder 
please  colonel 
please 
well  l       
my last physical examination was     
     not that long ago 
surely major knox has no desire
to hear me cough 
the other shoulder  please  colonel 
thank you  colonel 
not at all 
 is there a problem 
slauson  not with you  colonel 
general  we should leave now
in order to avoid the storm 
 thunder rumbles 
boyd told the general
colonel lves killed everyone 
martha 
what 
he said colonel lves
was the man responsible 
boyd gone loco 
i think he s the reason
nobody come back 
i have to warn you 
yeah  captain 
consider yourselves warned 
do you need this 
no  sir 
good 
knox 
you re not an eater of ribs  colonel 
no  no  major  i     
     can never forget it
used to be an animal 
sentimental fellow 
captain  you don t eat meat 
knox 
oh  no  he won t 
only as a last resort 
that s a pity 
boyd  no 
 cleaves laughs 
damn 
checkmate 
well  well 
it appears a number of us
could use some rest 
go on to bed  boyd 
colqhoun 
clearing up 
i found your private reich up there 
what was left  you didn t finish 
well  i can t blame you 
he was tough 
but then     
     a good soldier ought to be 
you know  not long ago
i couldn t do that 
i could barely take a breath
without coughing up a pint of blood 
tuberculosis 
that  along with     
     fierce headaches     
     depression     
     suicidal ambition       
i was in pretty horrible shape 
in fact     
     i was on my way to a sanitorium
to convalesce  more likely to die     
     when en route     
     this lndian scout told me
a curious story 
a man eats the flesh of another     
     he steals his strength 
he absorbs     
     the other man s spirit 
well     
     i just had to try 
consequently  i ate the scout first 
and he was absolutely right 
i grew     
     stronger 
later  my wagon train
grew lost in the rockies 
i ve heard this story before 
i ate five men in three months 
tuberculosis 
vanished 
as did the black thoughts 
i reached the end
of that spring feeling     
     happy     
     and healthy     
     and virile 
did you eat her too 
 as a matter of fact       
 you re disgusting 
one year later     
     i feel more alive than ever before 
that s what surprises me
about you  boyd 
you ve tasted it     
     felt its power 
yet you re resisting 
 why 
 because it s wrong 
morality 
the last bastion     
     of a coward 
i m sorry 
i m sorry 
did i offend you 
remember this 
you smell it 
scent always jogs the memory 
don t you think 
remember the energy 
the potency of someone else coursing
through your veins 
someone brave 
knowing the disappointment
as it dissipates 
the strength     
     slipping from your grasp 
growing     
     killing need to replenish 
i don t have to remind you of that 
you feel it right now 
i am gonna kill you 
he die  you die 
what in the heck is going on out here 
colqhoun 
captain boyd attacked me

you killed cleaves     
     and the horses 
what happened to you 
i thought i was dead 
i remember feeling panic
as my life slipped away 
it was like drowning in darkness 
and then     
     there was nothing 
and then i woke up 
ives was feeding me 
by the time i regained my senses 
there was no turning back 
i feel terrific

hart 
finished 
colqhoun  i m afraid major knox
has polished off the bourbon 
couldn t leave him in the pink 
you take over 
colqhoun 
manifest     
     destiny 
westward     
     expansion 
you know  come april     
     it will all start again 
thousands of gold hungry americans
will travel over those mountains     
     on their way to new lives     
     passing right through here 
we won t kill     
     indiscriminantly 
no 
selectively 
good god 
we don t want to break up families 
 people aren t stupid  lves 
 really 
 you ll get caught 
 well  if it s just the two of us 
jolly old hart and l 
you see  that s why we need others 
you  for one 
general slauson 
we don t wish to recruit everyone 
we have enough mouths to feed 
we just need a home 
and this country     
     is seeking to be whole 
stretching out its arms     
     and consuming all it can 
and we merely follow 
not me 
you know  it s not courage
to resist me  boyd 
it s courage to accept me 
i mean  you re already one of us 
well     
     almost 
you hunger for it 
you just won t resign yourself to it 
it s not so difficult  really 
acquiescence 
it s easy  actually 
you just give in 
i can t 
oh  well 
then     
     you die 
it s all right  it s not fatal 
not with the necessary precautions 
hart
