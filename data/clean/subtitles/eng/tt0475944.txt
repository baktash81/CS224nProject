how many times do i need to tell you
that im not him
thats the same thing
he said about his father
you know these powers
that you and your friends developed
when you were 13
are nothing compared with
what youll get when you ascend
they are 1000 times stronger
caleb
they are so seductive
youll suddenly think
the world is yours for the taking
and then you really start to use
and use
aging each time
taking bits of your life
until there is nothing left
i wont
thats what he said
i cant lose you both
i wont survive it this time
i wont
so why do you call them
the sons of ipswich

contemporary writers of fiction
first is cormac mccarthy
then tim obrien
kent haruf
and last but not least
stephen king
yeah dreamcatcher was the shit
thank you mr garwin but no
my choice is the shining
this is not the kind of publicity
this institution is interested in
you wouldnt know anything about it
would you mr danvers
no sir
but you would know about a fight
at a local bar last night
sir if i could
and if im correct
chase collins was with you
yes sir
chase collins comes to us
with a brilliant academic record
and his family trust has made
a generous endowment
to this institution
i want to make sure he has
a positive experience at spenser
do i make myself clear
yes sir
good
i understand you and chase
have already bonded
and i would appreciate it
if you would continue
to take him under your wing make
sure his stay here is a pleasant one
and caleb
sir
no more fights
yes sir
what is that
calebs family history
did you know that the witchcraft thing
started here in ipswich
every time i ask pogue about it
he just tells me its all nonsense
so what did the provost want
someone told him about
the fight at nickys
feel like elaborating on that
you got a piece of glass in your face
hold on
say my name
grow up dude
what are you looking at fag
that thing between your legs
its like a penis only smaller

i hate him when hes like this
hes been jealous since the day
we met it drives me crazy
you dont hate pogue

i hear you swim a mean freestyle
thats what they tell me
lets see what you got

push off lets go
you okay man
there you are
had us going there for a second
whacked your head pretty good
lucky for you chase was there
to get you out
before you sucked up the pool
he also whipped your ass
it became apparent
that the view of civil liberties
needing no special protection
was not widely shared
come in thank you
twelve amendments were suggested
10 eventually ratified
called the what ms snider
the bill of rights
right you are
arguably the first being the most
important read it for us mr simms
mr collins youre wanted
in the provosts office
mr simms
congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment
of religion
or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof
or abridging the freedom of speech
or of the press
or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble
provost higgins you wanted to
chase come in
you know one of our students
lost his life
a few nights back at the dells
yes i heard
did you know him
no sir why
his car was returned to his parents
his mother was kind enough
to send this back to us
my student id i lost it that night
it was in the back seat
thats odd i wonder how he got it
thank you sir
youre welcome
i understand youve become close
with caleb and his friends
yeah theyre great guys sir
i agree you couldnt have
picked a better bunch
i think so too
am i gonna see you tonight
i hope so
listen i have something to do first
ill give you a call later okay
ill be in my room
okay
whatd she say about kate
why wont she call me back
shes still pissed at you
why are we doing this
i saw the darkling again
yeah but why break into
the admissions office
because i wanna know more
about chase collins
look i dont even like the guy
are you sure youre not
just imagining this
im telling you his eyes were
as black as night in the pool today
all right
well how sick is she
she came in complaining
of chills and a headache
within an hour she had
a 101degree temperature
what could it be
the doctors checking her now
well call you when we know more
its okay im coming over there
they died in a car accident
it says chases father
just lost control
his real name was pope
chase goodwin pope
born july 14th 1988
the collins adopted him
after his mother died
when he was 2 years old
when did you say his birthday was
july 14th
thats the same day
his adoptive parents died
what year was he born
1988
they died on his 18th birthday
why are you taking her to the hospital
at gloucester
her temperatures jumped to 105
and shes showing symptoms
of anaphylactic shock
what does that mean
its a severe allergic reaction
to what
were not sure
its as if shed been bitten
by hundreds of insects
like spiders
goodwin pope goodwin pope
goodwin goodwin goodwin pope
agnes goodwin pope
thats where ive heard it before
what are you talking about
the book of damnation
they used to call her goody pope
do you remember her
i havent read the book
since we were kids
just call reid and tyler
i told them everything
about the darkling
what we found in his file
its a list of names
who brought charges against
john putnam and his family
during the salem hunt
pope was one of them
goody pope
widow of jacob mother to hagen
so what
so she claims that john putnam came
to her as an incubus in her dreams
after she was widowed
the book also records births
and deaths during the damnation
goody popes husband jacob
died june fourth 1692
her son hagen
was born april 11th 1693
thats 10 months and 24 days later
if what youre saying is true
and hagen pope is the bastard son
of john putnam
then the fifth bloodline
in the covenant didnt end in salem
and chase is one of us
thats crazy
he cant be
the night after the party
at the dells
someone was using
the power was strong enough
to wake me
the next night it happened again
i felt it then
see i told you
i felt it too
when you said it wasnt you
were you lying
no
you swear
i swear
then it was him
hey could i call you
caleb kates been attacked
wait wait what
they say its like
shes been bitten by spiders
and i had this terrible nightmare
about spiders
im scared caleb
something weird is happening
okay listen
i want you to go back to your dorm
and wait for me there
ill see you soon okay
okay
hes put a spell on kate
what are you talking about
what kind of spell
creation
spiders
theyre taking her to a hospital
in gloucester
dont do anything
until we know what he wants
were talking about kate
come to save little miss muffet
have we
well youre too late
a spider came
and sat down beside her
and frightened miss muffet away
you hurt kate and ill kill you
hurt her
i only used her to get to you
its you that im gonna hurt
and youre just my bait
to get to caleb
these are her things
why dont you go back to the dorm
and get some sleep
if i hear anything ill call you
hey
whats wrong
have you seen pogue
no but i called him
and told him about kate
well how is she
not so good but they said theyd call
if there are any changes
maybe this is him
pogues been in an accident
stop right there
close the door
lets just keep this between
the sons of ipswich
dont hurt her
she has nothing to do with this
whether she lives or dies
is entirely up to you my friend
you cant imagine what it was like
growing up not knowing what this was
when i finally found my real father
he filled in all the missing pieces
but it was too late i was hooked
by then he was
such a bitter old man
or i should say
bitter old young man
that all he wanted to do
was end the suffering
like all our bloodline before us
he was more than willing
to break the laws
of your sacred little club
so i got him to give me
his share of the power
and he died knowing that his son
was going to get revenge
on your covenant
you keep her in that spell
and shell die
i know
what is this all about
i mean what do you want
want
im chase collins
i have everything
i could possibly want
its what i need
more power
tomorrow night birthday boy
at the exact moment
when you ascend
be at putnam barn
where you will
will me your power
do that and ill let her live
and pogue kate reid and tyler
and your mom
and whats left of the families
and dont think i wont kill them
it comes natural to me
just ask my adoptive parents
you killed that kid at the dells
well he caught me
doing a little magic
at first he wasnt sure
but then well
he just wouldnt leave it alone
so i caught a ride with him
over to the bonfire
what are you doing
just making sure
im making my point
do you see my problem here
i like to use a lot
only
no one ever told me about
the effects and the damage
the addiction
and we both know
what happens now dont we
so
the way i see it
i add your power
to what i already have
it wont stop the aging
your father obviously found out
the hard way
my father never had
this kind of power
it doesnt work like that
its the body that wears down
not the power
just think of yourself
as a sacrificial lamb
hell
youre already their golden boy
why not go out a real hero
so tomorrow night the barn
where it all started
a birthday party just you and me
its either you
or them
brother
dont leave her like that shell die
what happened
you passed out when i told you
what
pogues been in an accident
is he okay
hey hey take it easy
what
stay away
hes more powerful
than you can imagine
hey dont worry
dont worry about that
we cant stop him
how is he
hes hurt pretty bad
wheres sarah
waiting room
i say we all go after chase
right now
listen it may not be that easy
you guys stay here with pogue
call me if theres a change
hows pogue
hes not good
what about kate
have you heard anything
they stabilized her
but shes still really sick
caleb look me in the eye
and tell me the truth
the spiders
i read about them theyre one
of the charges against john putnam
theyre some kind of spell
arent they
i wanna show you something
and then ill explain everything
dont be afraid
what about your caretaker
itll be okay
what are you doing
its all right
caleb
this is important to me gorman
its okay
this is william danvers iii
my father
hes 44 years old
every generation
the bloodlines produce only one
the eldest male
and youve always had this power
at 13 you get a taste of it
its a test in a way
at 18 we ascend
and our powers fully mature
and its seductive
and some can handle it
and others like my father couldnt
tonight at 12 minutes past 11
ill ascend
and what if you dont
will him your share
hes already got his fathers
it makes him very powerful
and what if someone wills you
their share
its against the covenant laws
if it werent i wouldnt let them
why not
when one ascends
the power becomes your life
thats why it ages you
will it away and you die
caleb you cannot do this alone
we have to go to the others
we cant do that
hell kill us all including you
pogue was the final warning
we have to go to your father
no
i know what youre thinking mother
and you know whatll happen
but he loves you
well then hell die with that secret
wheres sarah
upstairs changing
you should never have involved her
youre right
but i cant change the past
and hes using her against me
all of you
and its going to stop
i want you to take sarah
to the dance
ill meet you there i dont think
hell try anything in the open
would you just let us help you
you know weve got your back
i know you do

caleb caleb
whats your plan
you cant beat me you know
somethings happened

im just getting the feeling that
youre not gonna keep up
your end of the bargain
so i took out
a little insurance policy

you touch her and she dies
in fact times running out for sarah
so why dont we
get down to business
witchy
oops wait

how about an accident
you lose control of your car
on the way to the pathetic little dance
trust me im good at car accidents
everyonell miss you

but to them
youll become a legend
the one who gave his life for them
how about you let her go
and i let you live out your life
how about i make you
my weyotch
ill never will you my power
