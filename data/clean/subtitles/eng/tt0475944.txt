than you when we met 
did i ever tell you that 
yeah  you ve told me 
now  let s get you up to bed 
so handsome 
he was the most beautiful man
i d ever seen 
i m so afraid i ll lose you
like i did him 
how many times do i need to tell you
that i m not him 
that s the same thing
he said about his father 
you know  these powers   
   that you and your friends developed
when you were 13   
   are nothing compared with
what you ll get when you ascend 
they are 1000 times stronger 
caleb 
they are so seductive 
you ll suddenly think   
   the world is yours for the taking 
and then you really start to use   
   and use   
   aging each time 
taking bits of your life   
   until there is nothing left 
  i won t 
that s what he said 
i can t lose you both 
i won t survive it this time 
i won t 
so why do you call them
 the sons of ipswich  
what are they  like  a boy band 
you know what  i like you 
you re funny 
not like all the other
stuck up bitches 
no  they re supposedly descendants
of five families   
   that settled the ipswich colony
in the 1600s 
old money 
caleb and reid were both
checking you out tonight 
if it were me  i d go for caleb 
why 
he s just one of those
majorly good guys 
well  how do you mean 
he could stay here
and party with the rest of us   
   but he stays at home
to take care of his mom 
what s wrong with her 
after caleb s dad died 
she became a bit of an alcoholic 
so is he seeing anyone 
so we are interested 
  so who s the fifth 
  fifth what 
well  you said five families 
they say the fifth was killed
during the witch hunt 
  what 
  cool  huh 
or creepy 
couldn t see nothing but their taillights
in the damn fog 
but i swear to god   
   it sure seemed like
they went right off the damn cliffs 
what you were
probably looking at   
   were the aircraft warning lights
on the marblehead lighthouse 
captain  we have a suspect vehicle
with occupant back near the dells

i don t know  maybe 
i m telling you  it was strong enough
to wake me out of a dead sleep

to piss you off

  hey 
  hi 
good morning 
mr  danvers   
   provost higgins requests the
pleasure of your company after class 
we re going to study four american
contemporary writers of fiction 
first is cormac mccarthy 
then tim o brien   
   kent haruf 
and last but not least   
   stephen king 
  yeah  dreamcatcher was the shit 
thank you  mr  garwin  but no 
my choice is the shining 
this is not the kind of publicity
this institution is interested in 
you wouldn t know anything about it 
would you  mr  danvers 
no  sir 
but you would know about a fight
at a local bar last night 
  sir  if i could   
  and if i m correct   
   chase collins was with you 
yes  sir 
chase collins comes to us
with a brilliant academic record   
   and his family trust has made
a generous endowment   
   to this institution 
i want to make sure he has
a positive experience at spenser 
  do i make myself clear 
  yes  sir 
good 
i understand you and chase
have already bonded   
   and i would appreciate it
if you would continue   
   to take him under your wing  make
sure his stay here is a pleasant one 
  and  caleb 
  sir 
no more fights 
yes  sir 
what is that 
caleb s family history 
did you know that the witchcraft thing
started here in ipswich 
every time i ask pogue about it 
he just tells me it s all nonsense 
so  what did the provost want 
someone told him about
the fight at nicky s 
feel like elaborating on that 
you got a piece of glass in your face 
hold on 
  say my name 
  grow up  dude 
what are you looking at  fag 
that thing between your legs 
it s like a penis  only smaller 
hey  let him go  aaron 
don t be so sensitive  aaron 
size isn t everything 
my man 
up for some foosball 
i have dinner with sarah 
but i think i can hang out for a while 
  what about you 
  no  man  i m cool 
you re being ridiculous 
what is your problem 
  chase is my problem 
  what  are you jealous 
  i don t want you hanging around him 
  look  he is just a friend 
yeah  right  i m sure he s interested
in just being friends 
this is beyond idiotic 
thanks for dinner 
  how about saturday 
  what about saturday 
  it s the fall fest 
  oh  fall fest 
just wondering if
you wanted to go with me 
and  also 
it happens to be my birthday

i d love to go with you 
  i should go 
  yeah  yeah  you should 
  no  i mean  back to the dorms 
  yeah  i know what you mean 
i m really gonna go 
this is me leaving 
  good night 
  good night 
sleep tight 
i hate him when he s like this 
he s been jealous since the day
we met  it drives me crazy 
you don t hate pogue 
you guys are perfect for each other 
maybe not 
maybe it s time
to check out something new 
and maybe that s what
pogue s picking up on 
  this is the eighth time he s called 
  so talk to him 
no  not until he stops
being an idiot 
i ll bet caleb s not the jealous type 
go for it 
come on  man 
come on  pogue 
  he really is good 
  he s the best 
i hear you swim a mean freestyle 
  that s what they tell me 
  let s see what you got 
let s go 
push off  let s go 
you okay  man 
there you are 
had us going there for a second 
whacked your head pretty good 
lucky for you  chase was there
to get you out   
   before you sucked up the pool 
he also whipped your ass 
it became apparent
that the view of civil liberties   
   needing no special protection
was not widely shared 
come in  thank you 
twelve amendments were suggested 
10 eventually ratified 
called the what  ms  snider 
  the bill of rights 
  right you are 
arguably  the first being the most
important  read it for us  mr  simms 
mr  collins  you re wanted
in the provost s office 
mr  simms 
 congress shall make no law   
   respecting an establishment
of religion   
   or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof   
   or abridging the freedom of speech 
or of the press   
   or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble    
  provost higgins  you wanted to    
  chase  come in 
you know one of our students
lost his life   
   a few nights back at the dells 
yes  i heard 
  did you know him 
  no  sir  why 
his car was returned to his parents 
his mother was kind enough
to send this back to us 
  my student id  i lost it that night 
  it was in the back seat 
that s odd  i wonder how he got it 
  thank you  sir 
  you re welcome 
i understand you ve become close
with caleb and his friends 
yeah  they re great guys  sir 
i agree  you couldn t have
picked a better bunch 
i think so too 
  am i gonna see you tonight 
  i hope so 
listen  i have something to do first 
i ll give you a call later  okay 
  i ll be in my room 
  okay 
what d she say about kate 
why won t she call me back 
she s still pissed at you 
  why are we doing this 
  i saw the darkling again 
yeah  but why break into
the admissions office 
because i wanna know more
about chase collins 
look  i don t even like the guy 
are you sure you re not
just imagining this 
i m telling you  his eyes were
as black as night in the pool today 
all right 
well  how sick is she 
she came in complaining
of chills and a headache 
within an hour  she had
a 101 degree temperature 
  what could it be 
  the doctor s checking her now 
  we ll call you when we know more 
  it s okay  i m coming over there 
they died in a car accident 
it says chase s father
just lost control 
his real name was pope 
chase goodwin pope 
born july 14th  1988 
the collins adopted him
after his mother died   
   when he was 2 years old 
  when did you say his birthday was 
  july 14th 
that s the same day
his adoptive parents died 
  what year was he born 
  1988 
they died on his 18th birthday 
why are you taking her to the hospital
at gloucester 
her temperature s jumped to 105   
   and she s showing symptoms
of anaphylactic shock 
  what does that mean 
  it s a severe allergic reaction 
  to what 
  we re not sure 
it s as if she d been bitten
by hundreds of insects 
like spiders 
goodwin pope  goodwin pope 
goodwin  goodwin  goodwin pope 
agnes goodwin pope 
  that s where i ve heard it before 
  what are you talking about 
the book of damnation 
they used to call her goody pope 
do you remember her 
i haven t read the book
since we were kids 
just call reid and tyler 
i told them everything 
about the darkling 
what we found in his file   
it s a list of names   
   who brought charges against
john putnam and his family   
   during the salem hunt 
pope was one of them 
goody pope 
widow of jacob  mother to hagen 
so what 
so she claims that john putnam came
to her as an incubus in her dreams   
   after she was widowed 
the book also records births
and deaths during the damnation 
goody pope s husband  jacob 
died june fourth  1692 
her son  hagen 
was born april 11th  1693 
that s 10 months and 24 days later 
if what you re saying is true   
   and hagen pope is the bastard son
of john putnam   
   then the fifth bloodline
in the covenant didn t end in salem 
  and chase is one of us 
  that s crazy 
he can t be 
the night after the party
at the dells   
   someone was using 
the power was strong enough
to wake me 
the next night  it happened again 
  i felt it then 
  see  i told you 
i felt it too 
when you said it wasn t you 
were you lying 
no 
  you swear 
  i swear 
then it was him 
  hey  could i call you    
  caleb  kate s been attacked 
wait  wait  what 
they say it s like
she s been bitten by spiders   
   and i had this terrible nightmare
about spiders 
i m scared  caleb 
something weird is happening 
okay  listen 
i want you to go back to your dorm   
   and wait for me there 
  i ll see you soon  okay 
  okay 
he s put a spell on kate 
what are you talking about 
what kind of spell 
creation 
spiders 
they re taking her to a hospital
in gloucester 
don t do anything
until we know what he wants 
we re talking about kate 
come to save little miss muffet 
have we 
well  you re too late 
a spider came
and sat down beside her   
   and frightened miss muffet away 
you hurt kate  and i ll kill you 
hurt her 
i only used her to get to you 
it s you that i m gonna hurt 
and you re just my bait
to get to caleb 
these are her things 
why don t you go back to the dorm
and get some sleep 
if i hear anything  i ll call you 
hey 
what s wrong 
have you seen pogue 
no  but i called him
and told him about kate 
well  how is she 
not so good  but they said they d call
if there are any changes 
maybe this is him 
pogue s been in an accident 
stop right there 
close the door 
let s just keep this between
the sons of ipswich 
don t hurt her 
she has nothing to do with this 
whether she lives or dies
is entirely up to you  my friend 
you can t imagine what it was like
growing up not knowing what this was 
when i finally found my real father 
he filled in all the missing pieces 
but it was too late  i was hooked 
by then  he was
such a bitter old man   
or i should say 
bitter  old  young man 
  that all he wanted to do
was end the suffering 
like all our bloodline before us   
   he was more than willing
to break the laws   
   of your sacred little club 
so i got him to give me
his share of the power 
and he died knowing that his son
was going to get revenge   
   on your covenant 
you keep her in that spell 
and she ll die 
i know 
what is this all about 
i mean  what do you want 
want 
i m chase collins 
i have everything
i could possibly want 
it s what i need 
more power 
tomorrow night  birthday boy   
   at the exact moment
when you ascend   
   be at putnam barn   
   where you will
will me your power 
do that  and i ll let her live 
and pogue  kate  reid and tyler
and your mom   
   and what s left of the families 
and don t think i won t kill them 
it comes natural to me 
just ask my adoptive parents 
you killed that kid at the dells 
well  he caught me
doing a little magic 
at first  he wasn t sure 
but then  well   
   he just wouldn t leave it alone 
so i caught a ride with him
over to the bonfire 
what are you doing 
just making sure
i m making my point 
do you see my problem here 
i like to use  a lot 
only   
   no one ever told me about   
   the effects and the damage 
the addiction 
and we both know
what happens  now  don t we 
so   
   the way i see it   
   i add your power
to what i already have 
it won t stop the aging 
your father obviously found out
the hard way 
my father never had
this kind of power 
it doesn t work like that 
it s the body that wears down 
not the power 
just think of yourself
as a sacrificial lamb 
hell   
   you re already their golden boy 
why not go out a real hero 
so tomorrow night  the barn 
where it all started 
a birthday party  just you and me 
it s either you   
   or them   
   brother 
don t leave her like that  she ll die 
what happened

what about kate 
have you heard anything 
they stabilized her 
but she s still really sick 
caleb  look me in the eye
and tell me the truth 
the spiders 
i read about them  they re one
of the charges against john putnam 
they re some kind of spell 
aren t they 
i wanna show you something   
   and then i ll explain everything 
don t be afraid 
what about your caretaker 
it ll be okay 
  what are you doing 
  it s all right 
  caleb   
  this is important to me  gorman 
it s okay 
this is william danvers iii 
my father 
he s 44 years old 
every generation 
the bloodlines produce only one 
the eldest male 
and you ve always had this power 
at 13  you get a taste of it 
it s a test  in a way 
at 18  we ascend 
and our powers fully mature   
   and it s seductive 
and some can handle it 
and others  like my father  couldn t 
tonight  at 12 minutes past 11 
i ll ascend 
and what if you don t
will him your share 
he s already got his father s 
it makes him very powerful 
and what if someone wills you
their share 
it s against the covenant laws 
if it weren t  i wouldn t let them 
  why not 
  when one ascends   
   the power becomes your life 
that s why it ages you 
will it away  and you die 
caleb  you cannot do this alone 
we have to go to the others 
we can t do that 
he ll kill us all  including you 
pogue was the final warning 
  we have to go to your father 
  no 
i know what you re thinking  mother 
and you know what ll happen 
but he loves you 
well  then  he ll die with that secret 
  where s sarah 
  upstairs  changing 
  you should never have involved her 
  you re right 
but i can t change the past   
   and he s using her against me 
all of you   
   and it s going to stop 
i want you to take sarah
to the dance 
i ll meet you there  i don t think
he ll try anything in the open 
would you just let us help you 
you know we ve got your back 
i know you do 
but please  just once  do what i ask 
you look beautiful  my dear 
  ready

  i won t risk you 
  i m scared

i promise 
be careful  i ll call you 
  hey  any sign of him 
  no

if he does show   
   please promise me you won t
do anything stupid 
  how s sarah doing  can i talk to her 
  yeah  she s fine  hang on 
  she was just here 
  guys  what s going on 
caleb  caleb 
what s your plan 
you can t beat me  you know 
something s happened 
you know   
   i m just getting the feeling that   
   you re not gonna keep up
your end of the bargain   
   so i took out
a little insurance policy 
she does look quite stunning 
you touch her  and she dies 
in fact  time s running out for sarah 
so why don t we
get down to business 
witchy 
oops  wait 
did i just say   witch  
all right  tell you what 
i ll make this easy for you 
how about an accident 
you lose control of your car
on the way to the pathetic little dance 
trust me  i m good at car accidents 
everyone ll miss you 
they ll say great things about you 
only the covenant
will know the real truth 
but  to them 
you ll become a legend 
the one who gave his life for them 
how about you let her go 
and i let you live out your life 
how about i make you
my  weyotch  
i ll never will you my power 
then it looks like trouble for sarah 
i ll never let that happen 
fine  let s do it your way 
like taking candy from a baby 
easy as pie 
  you find her 
  no 
twelve minutes past 11 
happy birthday  caleb 
are we ascending 
finally 
scary  huh  caleb   
   this new power you get
when you ascend 
frankly  i don t think
you re cut out for it 
so why don t we just call it a night 
just say the words 
okay  i m a little impressed 
  not bad 
  thanks 
trying to impress your date  huh 
you ready to say uncle 
i m ready for you to go to hell 
leave us  gorman 
just say the words 
say the words  and it s all over 
listen to me  william 
i need you to understand me 
come on  say it  say the words 
 i

for once in your life

   you   
   my power
