everyone calling you bad luck 
i can relate  though

peter

but to think you found this
on your first trip to the woods   
she s called  fly by night   
 fly by night  
a rare flower  she is 
i ve never seen a real one before 
she only grows in these woods
and only blooms once in seven years 
they say even witches once
sought after her 
witches 
that s right  the witch s flower 
the witch s flower   
what could that be 
tib 
what s the matter 
did something happen 
have a fight with gib 
tib

hey  that tickles

they re strict about tardiness 
hey  wait for me

endor college   
this is the main gate 
many a fine witch has
passed through this gate 
it s a prestigious school
dating back to the days of dragons 
oh  yes 
i need to read you something 
endor college rule number one 
remember this  or you will pay dearly 
pay dearly 
ready  ahem 
 trespassers will be transformed  
now  repeat 
 trespassers will be transformed   
those who enter wrongfully
will be transformed into
some other form 
new pupils get a tour from
the headmistress herself 
wait 
so long  until later 
he abandoned me 
am i supposed to enter 
how strange   
this must be a mistake 
they ll let us out

welcome to endor college 
you must be a new pupil 
no  actually  i   
look at this black cat familiar 
and this hair

you aren t  of course  a trespasser 
i m a new pupil  madam 
excellent  excellent 
i am the headmistress 
madam mumblechook  your name 
what  oh  mary smith  madam 
welcome to endor college  mary smith 
this is the single finest
college of magic 
open only to the chosen ones 
college of magic   
come  now  let me
show you around the campus 
sunlight is collected to
illuminate the campus day and night 
it s beautiful 
you like what you see 
it s madam mumblechook 
look  tib 
hello  madam 
good day to you 
you have elevators  too 
they run on electricity 
electricity is a form of magic  you know 
what  what s happening 
let s tour the classrooms first 
this is the first year classroom 
they re taking broom riding lessons 
it takes over a year to gain
true mastery over a broom 
i see 
but you won t be needing it 
i noticed you were quite adept
with the broom 
you need to see our
more specialized fields 
specialized 
magic aeronautics 
magic history  magic chemistry   
we offer various majors in magic 
but we are perhaps best known
for transformation magic 
considered the most difficult 
transformation 
wow 
but it s an awful lot of studying 
don t you have sports
or field trips 
we have our recreations  of course 
indeed  this is a place for cultivating
excellence in both body and spirit 
we have ample facilities
for physical training 
this is amazing 
this is the dining hall 
we allow our students to eat
whenever and as much as they please 
they re using magic to cook 
looks delicious 
it seems you have a remarkable talent 
miss mary smith 
truly phenomenal 
a talent  for what 
what else  for magic  of course 
the insignia on your hand is proof 
oh  this   
i can already see it 
you re a once in a century prodigy 
mastering the broom already 
and taming such a perfect familiar
as a black cat with emerald eyes 
i m not used to getting
compliments like this 
oh no  it is indeed remarkable 
this flaming red hair of yours 
red haired witches have always
been the most superior 
no other hair color is
more coveted by witches 
only prodigies possess this hair 
this is our laboratory 
in second year  you ll also
conduct chemical experiments 
chemical experiments  not magic 
it s doctor dee s class 
the renowned wizard 
the pride of our college 
you haven t heard of him 
oh    of course 
the doctor  right 
i ll introduce you to him 
doctor  doctor dee 
yes  madam mumblechook 
i was just about to analyze
the results of the earlier tests 
what warrants this interruption 
magic experiments must be analyzed
with precise calculations 
on top of which we must
devise meticulous plans 
allow me to introduce you to
mary smith  a new pupil 
a splendid talent with great potential 
and do look at her red hair 
red is indeed a marvelous color 
red is the most mature form
of a philosopher s stone   
though i wonder if it was
first black  then white 
in any case  nice to meet you  miss mary 
nice to meet you  too 
doctor dee has long studied
the fusion of chemistry and magic 
a question for the able one 
if we call virtual reality worlds
from the interbaila language  turtle 
and the approximate value of magic
in the ancient eltel language  crane  
which of the two do you think
is the more effective approach
in terms of the alphalabozome
nucleic acid anti entatium reaction 
  uh   
  the turtle or crane 
turtle    i think   
turtle  you say  impossible 
no  you may indeed be right 
you ve carved a new path 
madam  this child is splendid 
you re well versed in chemistry  too 
well  i m not so bad at science 
very well 
i shall show you
our most advanced class 
great 
this is our most advanced class 
but   
there s no one here 
i see the class is going well 
wow   
they re practicing invisibility 
let s see you try it 
you  grizel 
let her borrow yours 
but there s no way 
i ve never done this   
here 
sorry  tib 
now look into the ball and concentrate 
the flower insignias 
now dissolve your cells down
to the level of unconsciousness 
then use magical fusion
to cloak yourself 
fine  whatever happens will happen 
disappear  disappear  disappear 
disappear  disappear   
she s doing it 
superb 
what s happening  wait   
could it be 
she s already surpassed invisibility 
what  what s happening 
tib 
tib 
excellent 
most sublime  mary smith 
where did you acquire such skill 
that was a very advanced spell 
how unexpected 
you may be a prodigy the likes
of which we ve never seen 
what  oh  no no   
that is the power of
a red haired witch 
  no wonder 
  a red haired witch 
she s amazing 
i suppose that was only about
40 percent of my power 
unbelievable 
we re hoping to reach
even loftier heights here 
and we re truly honored to welcome
a gifted witch such as yourself 
i m looking forward to it 
a round of applause for the enrollment
of this rare prodigy  mary smith 
don t worry 
i think i d make a fine witch 
my heart s still racing 
come to my office so i can
give you an enrollment form 
yes  with pleasure 
well now  i must tend to my
experiments in transformation magic 
transformation magic 
that s the strongroom 
it s where we keep the subjects
of our transformation experiments 
oh   
a young specimen  this one
will make a great teaching aid 
these are wonderful experiments
that turn powerless animals
into magical beings 
transformation experiments 
tib 
what s the matter  tib 
hold on to your familiar 
i m sorry 
what was that 
the progress of science and magic
is built on countless failures 
failures 
precisely  failures are valuable 
well  farewell for now  miss smith 
i shall see you again after
the sun sets and the moon rises
and the moon sets and the sun rises 
now let s get going  miss mary 
before it gets dark 
yes  madam 
enrollment form  enrollment form   
i m sorry  go ahead and
wait for me upstairs 
oh  sure 
you sure did surprise me 
you truly are a remarkable talent 
upstairs you ll find magical items
dating back to ancient times 
hopefully we ll have a talent
like you using them soon 
amazing 
that s odd 
the enrollment form for
honor students should be here 
it s that flower 
master spells 
spell to eliminate darkness 
spell to make something rotten 
spell to ease stomach pains 
spell to deflect an enemy s attack 
a book of magic spells 
starting tomorrow 
we should have you serve as
our student representative 
huh 
why is   
you re more than qualified 
you re the perfect person
to represent us 
and perhaps i can ask you to
head up the festival committee 
um   
and also lead the study tours 
i m sure you ll soon represent us
at the academic conferences  too 
after all  you ve already mastered
such advanced magic   
wait  madam    that s not true 
not true 
you see  it s not that
i m talented or anything 
being able to fly on the broom 
or becoming invisible   
it s all thanks to a mysterious flower 
flower 
a flower  you said 
well  um   
a mysterious flower  you said 
uh   
do you have it with you now 
you re hiding something
behind your back 
no   
what is it 
it s nothing 
show it to me 
what might this be 
i don t recognize this language 
 51 village of redmanor  to peter   
the flower belongs to him 
i don t really understand it myself 
i see 
that boy has great talents 
far more than i do   
may i hold onto this 
oh    sure 
i ll give you the enrollment form now 
fill it out and bring it tomorrow 
yes  madam 
you don t need to see me off 
i ll just be on my way 
thank you for today 
next time let s debate the
discontinuity of filio functions  mary 
there he is 
my broomstick 
look  your master s come back 
but i don t know the way home 
don t worry  the broom knows 
that s a relief 
let s try again 
maybe gentler this time 
tib  let s go home 
tib 
what s the matter 
maybe there s something
keeping him here 
cats have an affinity
for magic  after all 
tib  let s go  please 
i want to get home 
good  now hold on tight 
right 
that broomstick   
remember  love your broom 
to home 
i said gentler this time 
what a splendid witch
we have joining us 
she brings great promise 
she knows where the flowers are 
yes  indeed 
wait  what  the stolen flowers 
yes 
and you let her leave 
with those flowers  we   
no need to worry 
she left us something useful 
she might as well be
a leashed cat now 
what should i do 
i stole the book 
tib  are you okay 
what are you upset about 
the book 
i couldn t help it 
i was really scared  you know 
i thought i was going
to be eaten alive 
anyone would ve   
little broomstick 
i guess the magic faded 
but i m not dreaming anymore  am i 
tib 
he s gone 
such a moody cat 
ow   
ow   
my bum   
mary 
thank goodness 
great aunt charlotte 
i knew it  i m not dreaming anymore 
mary  we were worried  you know 
oh my  slow down a little  dear 
but i m really hungry 
it must ve been a wonderful day 
yes  yes it was   
yes  it was unbelievably exciting 
but do try to come home
a little earlier 
let s go easy on her 
these things happen sometimes  right 
but home is still the best 
home  you said 
this is yummy 
 fill out the form
and bring it tomorrow   
not that i ll ever go back 
 you truly are a remarkable talent   
 you may well be a prodigy 
mary smith   
 we should have you serve as
our student representative  
yes  coming 
why  zebedee  what is it 
do you know where peter is 
peter 
what s happened to peter 
it seems    he s gone missing 
he s gone missing 
his bicycle was found at
the edge of the woods 
my  in that mist 
into the woods 
oh my goodness   
don t worry  i m sure he ll
come home in no time 
we ll go look for him 
do take care 
give our regards to his mother 
i will  good night 
he must ve gone into the woods 
tib 
what is this 
mary smith  the impostor witch 
how dare you taint
our noble establishment 
you haven t a single drop
of witch blood in you 
seems the mist has brought
this boy to us 
peter 
it was easy to find him   
all thanks to your help 
want to save him 
then bring me the witch s flower 
bring me the flower 
and i shall let the boy go 
but if you don t   
remember the rule 
 trespassers will be transformed   
so long  be well 
it s my fault 
i know  we have to go 
wait 
mary 
ow  i need you to fly quietly 
or we ll be found 
tib 
to endor college 
mary  are you here 
this is   
mary   
thanks 
wait for me here 
let s go  tib 
hey  wait for me 
welcome back to endor college 
mary smith 
i didn t think we would
see you again so soon 
indeed  your return was faster than
gelmen s magical reaction 
let peter go 
you brought it 
that flower is too dangerous
for you to keep  hand it over 
where s peter  let him go 
give it back 
well done 
how beautiful 
hey  let me go  stop it 
take her to the strongroom 
she s a valuable specimen 
so handle her with care 
this isn t what we agreed to 
liars  cowards 
ow   
what do we do  tib 
tib 
what 
what    are these    
are you the
transformation experiments 
you must be the  failures 
that doctor dee mentioned 
how awful 
tib 
tib  but that s   
gib    is that you 
i see  tib  you wanted me
to rescue your girlfriend 
i m sorry  gib 
i don t know what to do   
you  witch  get me out of here 
peter 
mary  what are you doing here 
mary 
are you okay 
i m sorry  peter 
this is it  without a doubt 
we can now resume the final phase
of our experiment   
now that we have this flower 
tadpoles become frogs 
cocoons become butterflies 
at last  we can give our students
the enormous power to wield
any magic whatsoever 
with that power
we can change the world 
it s been a long time coming 
we must succeed this time 
lest we repeat that tragedy 
with a younger subject now 
we can t go wrong 
the more innocent the child 
the easier to transform 
yes  yes  yes  yes 
precisely  they absorb the
magic more directly 
i ll begin preparations at once 
i m sorry   
don t worry 
i wish they would ve transformed
me instead  into an adult 
then i d be able to help mother 
especially if i could use magic 
you re not the only one
who wants to change 
peter   
there s got to be a way out of here 
i need to get home no matter what 
let s go home   
together 
peter 
ouch   
are you okay 
let s go home together 
tib and gib  too 
all of us together 
good 
say  how did you get here 
me  i rode a broomstick 
a broomstick 
mary  you can use magic 
yes  well  only for one night 
that s right  i m   
actually a witch tonight 
hurry  we need to rush
those kids to the lab 
you never know
what kids are up to 
 spell to unfasten locks  
no  not that 
you can read this 
 spell to destroy doors   
no  we need to undo their spells 
spells  so you perform magic
by chanting spells 
i don t think it s chanting
as much as using magical powers   
magical powers 
where do you find powers like that 
found it 
 spell to undo all magic   
this would open the door and undo   
the transformations 
mary 
what is going on 
gib 
mary 
tib  gib 
what is this 
what just happened 
the spells on the animals were undone 
the door should be open  too 
let s go 
oh  okay 
what s that 
it s dangerous here 
let s go another way 
impossible 
i put a spell on that door 
it was an advanced magical lock 
what could that be 
how did this happen 
it s gone 
she took the  master spells  
look  the door is open 
mary 
i m over here 
where are we 
peter 
they re all leaving from there 
let s go 
there they are 
what are they doing 
madam  those kids did all this 
she used the  master spells   
this is a disaster 
we have no choice but to jump 
let s go 
wait 
newcomer 
little broomstick

your broom anywhere 
park them where they belong  i said 
mister flanagan 
kids these days don t

commotion today

flanagan

hold on tight

peter 
mary  you go without me

a pure eyed child is
the perfect subject

i must go retrieve
the  master spells   
who knows what she ll try
to do with that book 
go back  i said go back 
why won t you do as i say 
where are you taking me 
that island 
little broomstick 
ow   
hey  what is going on 
little broomstick 
whose home is this 
welcome home  miss 
miss 
i see  it s your home 
oh  because i told you to go back   
it s been a long time  miss 
pleasure to have you back 
truth be told  i didn t think
you would ever come back 
now please  come inside 
hello   
i hope it s okay to come in 
what a lovely room 
photos 
madam and doctor dee 
tib 
don t  this isn t our home 
this is   
what gib was transformed into 
these are lab notes 
how dare they 
what    is this    
mary   
i m sorry  i was just   
oh  it s just a mirror 
the mirror is   
mary 
great aunt charlotte 
but why 
that s my old home 
the broomstick must ve
taken you there 
your home  and the broomstick 
i don t understand 
do you have the  fly by night  
uh  no 
madam and doctor dee took it 
i see    as i feared 
what exactly is going on 
mary  listen 
what they are trying to do
is very dangerous 
wow 
it was a long time ago 
i stole the flower seeds
from madam and doctor dee 
stole them 
back then  everyone loved
madam and doctor dee 
they were kindhearted teachers
and gifted scientists 
but   
when i found that flower  i made
the mistake of giving it to them 
after that  they were never the same 
they grew obsessed with studying
the magical seeds of that flower 
that flower has unimaginable power 
madam wanted to use that power
to give the students
great magical ability 
but the experiment failed 
they couldn t control it 
all i could do was take the
remaining seeds and escape 
i couldn t let them
repeat that mistake 
some powers in this world
