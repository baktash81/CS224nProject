they go by many names
dave carl paul mike
oh that one is norbert
hes an idiot
theyre all different
but they all share the same goal
to serve the most despicable master
they could find
boss
making their master happy was
the tribes very reason for existence
but thats not to say that
they didnt have other passions
oh hey looka
cé un banono
move on
mé mé no
mé no banana
miam miam
finding a boss was easy
but keeping a boss
there in lies the rub
makalo
nope it wasnt easy for these guys
but they never gave up
with the emergence of the stone age
came the rise of a new species
man was very different
from the dinosaur
he was shorter hairier
and way way smarter
the minions took an instant liking to man
and helped him the best they could
oh no no té
la pignata
yeah yeah yeah
si si
pala boukére
poor man
so trusting so fragile
so so delicious
their quest for a boss
put the minions front and center
for some of civilizations
most historic moments
raa kaba ank
anubis
hiyah
ancient egypt held great promise
fala tuba
ok
earthquake
but it didnt last long
the dark ages were actually fun times
their new master had a tendency
to party all night and sleep all day
ratchooturi
le gateau
but eventually the party was over
they bounced from one evil boss
to another
but they never seemed
to find their perfect fit
one particular employer took
their failure very very badly
the minions had no other choice
but to keep moving
look alé
and then when all hope seemed lost
they found sanctuary
the minions were safe
years passed as the minions
forged their own civilization
they truly made a life for themselves
but something just wasnt right
pé palatoo
malakika
pérom malaki
they felt empty inside
without a master they had no purpose
they became aimless
and depressed
la mani batica
if this continued any longer
the minions would perish
but all was not lost
for one minion had a plan
his name was kevin
he was excited to share
his idea with the tribe
hed been preparing for days
weeks months
but now he was ready

go back to the outside world
and he would not return
until he had found his tribe
the biggest baddest villain to serve
kiday come me

really good bedtime porry
once upon a time
there were three little pigs
one fateful day
the pigs encountered a big bad wolf
who had a wonderful surprise for them
the wolf offered the three piggies
and all their friends
a job working for her
everyone would be so happy
all the three little piggies had to do
was just steal one little crown
that the beautiful wolf had wanted
ever since she was
a penniless little street cub
unloved and abandoned
but that crown would mean
she was a princess
and everybody loves a princess
so the wolf sent the piggies
to get that crown
but the little pigs
werent up to the challenge
they failed their mission
so the wolf
huffed and puffed
and she blew them
off the face of the earth
the end
good luck getting
that crown tomorrow little piggies
i know you wont disappoint me
