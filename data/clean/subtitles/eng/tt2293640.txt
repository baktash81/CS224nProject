they go by many names 
dave  carl  paul  mike 
oh  that one is norbert 
he s an idiot 
they re all different 
but they all share the same goal 
to serve the most despicable master
they could find 
boss 
making their master happy was
the tribe s very reason for existence 
but that s not to say that
they didn t have other passions 
oh  hey  looka 
cé un banono 
move on 
mé  mé no 
mé no  banana 
miam  miam 
finding a boss was easy 
but keeping a boss 
there in lies the rub 
makalo 
nope  it wasn t easy for these guys 
but they never gave up 
with the emergence of the stone age
came the rise of a new species 
man was very different
from the dinosaur 
he was shorter  hairier 
and way  way smarter 
the minions took an instant liking to man 
and helped him the best they could 
oh no  no  té 
la pignata 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
si  si 
pala boukére
poor man 
so trusting  so fragile 
so  so delicious 
their quest for a boss
put the minions front and center
for some of civilization s
most historic moments 
raa kaba ank 
anubis 
hi yah 
ancient egypt held great promise 
fala tuba 
ok 
earthquake 
but it didn t last long 
the dark ages were actually fun times 
their new master had a tendency
to party all night and sleep all day 
ratch ooturi 
le gateau 
but eventually  the party was over 
they bounced from one evil boss
to another 
but they never seemed
to find their perfect fit 
one particular employer took
their failure very  very badly 
the minions had no other choice
but to keep moving 
look alé 
and then  when all hope seemed lost 
they found sanctuary 
the minions were safe 
years passed as the minions
forged their own civilization 
they truly made a life for themselves 
but something just wasn t right 
pé palatoo 
malakika 
pérom malaki 
they felt empty inside 
without a master  they had no purpose 
they became aimless   
and depressed 
  la mani batica   
if this continued any longer 
the minions would perish 
but all was not lost 
for one minion had a plan 
his name was kevin 
he was excited to share 
his idea with the tribe 
he d been preparing for days 
weeks  months 
but now he was ready

kevin would leave the cave 
go back to the outside world 
and he would not return
until he had found his tribe
the biggest  baddest villain to serve 
kiday come me 
but he needed help

bob was eager to go 
but kevin felt he was
just not strong enough

once upon a time 
there were three little pigs 
one fateful day 
the pigs encountered a big  bad wolf   
who had a wonderful surprise for them 
the wolf offered the three piggies
and all their friends
a job working for her 
everyone would be so happy 
all the three little piggies had to do
was just steal one little crown
that the beautiful wolf had wanted
ever since she was
a penniless little street cub 
unloved and abandoned 
but that crown would mean
she was a princess 
and everybody loves a princess 
so the wolf sent the piggies
to get that crown 
but the little pigs
weren t up to the challenge 
they failed their mission 
so the wolf 
huffed and puffed 
and she blew them
off the face of the earth 
the end 
good luck getting
that crown tomorrow  little piggies 
i know you won t disappoint me

and by the way 
it was me  herb  the whole time 
i don t even know anyone named blerb 
se pala 
i am hours away from becoming
the queen of england 
i know 
it s a gas 
i will finally get my crown 
yeah 
it s all i ve ever wanted 
i m going to be so happy 
but 
let me ask you something  fabrice 
does that look like this to you 
mrs  overkill 
the hair in that picture 
it s just two wavy lines 
so  what  now you re an art critic 
i drew that when i was five years old 
get out of my sight 
bye  fabrice 
i liked him  he was fun 
so  what do you think of the dress 
oh  it s so beautiful 
so fashion forward 
so valentino 
gave it a sweetheart neckline
because you re my sweetheart 
the high collar and cinched waist
reflect a simpler 
more violent time 
the material is a blend of taffeta
and high density body armor 
fully armed and loaded 
and that glow  that s nuclear 
nice  just one more thing to do 
gotta look good for the public 
do you mind 
my pleasure 
little tighter  sweetie 
come on  i can take it 
little tighter 
tighter 
must have tiny waist 
seeing stars  seeing stars 
losing feeling in my legs 
perfect  tie it  tie it  tie it  tie it
