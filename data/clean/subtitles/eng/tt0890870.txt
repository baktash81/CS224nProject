its in our nature to save them
its what we do

supposed to do that
when this is our life
we chose this
you go home
hoffman there are two agents

wheres the body
the crime scene photographers flash
picked up this bullet casing
it was lodged between the body
and the device
run it for prints
give us the room for a minute
would you thanks
the lock was open
she couldnt get out
it was constructed for her execution
betrayed the rules
not a jigsaw trap then
no amanda young
the accomplice
this wasnt done by amanda young
excuse me
detective kerry weighed
approximately 130 lbs
amanda youngs arrest report
has her at 107
she couldnt get her up there alone
john kramer was
the bedridden cancer patient
hes brains not brawn
he was also an engineer
he could have rigged pulleys
or someone else
could have helped him
special agent if youre here for any
other reason than just to assist
were here to find the person
your department couldnt detective
the one helping jigsaw
and amanda young
excuse me
we found a harlequin doll in your
possession whats that about
its a toy
the kids play with toys
thats all it is
how about the tricycle
the tricycle is from johns youth
a grown man has
a tricycle his whole life
im sure youve kept things
that were important to you
look ms tuck
is there any reason
we should be concerned
for your safety
perhaps you should be
more concerned for yourself
why dont you tell me
everything you know about john
and lets start at the beginning
johns life defies chronology
and linear description
so why dont we start at the end
and work our way backwards
i represent ms tuck
she knows something
i thought you were going home
you have vacation time right
take it
finish the remodeling
spend some time with tracy
she understands
then dont take her for granted
eric is still out there man
erics been missing for six months
kerry was gone for four days
i can only be as optimistic
as the facts allow
yeah well im in it till i find him
finding his body is not gonna
vindicate us
finding him alive will
its time to let go
i want you to go home
ill call you later to make sure
everything is okay
whos he
lieutenant rigg
our swat commander
whats his problem
everyone around him keeps dying
whats it say
it says i tried calling you
four times
it says dinner is in the fridge
and at the bottom it says
i love you
i need to help my mom
for a few days
just
come with me okay now
i cant
you can
but you wont
what you cant do
is save everyone
tracy
tracy please listen to me
john kramer owned a company called
the urban renewal group
no irony in that huh
what was rigg watching
jill tucks interrogation
she was jigsaws ex its old
why is a swat guy watching that
strahm i really think
we should tell hoffman
what detective kerry said
in her last message
she said two officers
might be in danger
but until we know who
were not causing a panic
if detective hoffman or anyone else
in this precinct is in danger
i think they should know it
not your call
making any progress
were fine thanks
hey boss looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital
maybe its
thanks
ill check it out
if you need me call my cell
coffee machine is around the corner
a boy or a girl
a girl
i didnt know you were married
im not
its a short story believe me
tracy
tracy
hello officer rigg
welcome to your rebirth
fuck
for years youve stood by
and witnessed
as your colleagues have fallen
you have remained untouched
while eric matthews
has disappeared
but with your survival
came your obsession
obsession to stop
those around you
from making the wrong choices
thus preventing you
from making the right ones
you wanted to save everyone
tonight i give you
the opportunity
to face your obsession
look closely
eric matthews is still alive
eric
the block of ice he stands upon
is melting
he has but 90 minutes
to save himself
detective hoffmans fate is linked
to erics survival
heed my warning
officer rigg
their lives hang in the balance
of your obsession
will you learn how to let go
and truly save them
the choice is yours
dont fucking move
jesus
take off the mask
put your hands in the air
i cant
officer rigg your first test
the person in front of you
is in desperate need of help
but it is not your job
to save them
you view this person as a victim
but if you want to see what i see
beneath the mask lies a criminal
undeserving of the life she leads
your obsession tells you
to save the victim
i tell you to walk away
the choice is yours
are you a cop
what
are you a cop
yeah im a cop
what is that
what did you do
theyre in the gears
whats in the gears

from 23 park place
thats riggs apartment
hello brenda
i want to play a game
an officer will try to save you
if he is successful
then your game begins
this man will use these photos
to sentence you for your crimes
and the only way to stop him
is taped underneath the tv
let him save your life
and accept your fate
to rot in prison
or kill him
and guarantee your freedom
make your choice
ill fucking kill you
you fucking bitch
rigg

hoffman
calling
how do you explain
detective matthews
hes alive
six months
jigsaw never kept anyone that long
no one but amanda young
you think hes been fixed
why these six
hoffmans a decorated lieutenant
he doesnt fit the profile
thats what you see
but what does he see
rigg trying to save his two friends
maybe
you got names and locations
on any of these people
working it
this is overkill
its a setup to announce
rigg is the accomplice
or a setup for his alibi
everyone around him keeps dying
where is he to tell us hes innocent
or what the hell these photos
are doing in his apartment
look there
move please
four walls build a home

hello officer rigg
if you are hearing this
then you have reached
detective matthews
and detective hoffman
in under 90 minutes
resulting in their deaths
the rules were clear
you were warned
its kerry
do not go through that door
you know never to go
through an unsecured door ever
tonight you face your obsession
what you cant do
is save everyone
will you learn how to let go
eric is still out there man
its time to let go
detective matthews has
but 90 minutes
i recommend you stay alive
until the fucking clock
counts down
they had to save themselves
take em
their salvation was
out of your hands
time was on your side
but your obsession
wouldnt let you wait
instead of saving
detective matthews
you cost him his life
you failed your final test
what i dont understand is
how the hell could jigsaw do all this
he was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him
im not so sure he did
this wasnt done by amanda young
excuse me
she couldnt get her up there alone
john kramer was
hes brains not brawn
were here to find the person
helping jigsaw and amanda young
looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital
you go home
we chose this
game over
you feel you now have control
dont you
you think you will
walk away untested
i promise that my work
will continue
that i have ensured
by hearing this tape
some will assume
that this is over
