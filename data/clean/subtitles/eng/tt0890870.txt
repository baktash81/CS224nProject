i thought she was still alive 
thought i could save her 
did you ever think
that we would end up here
when we first started 
no 
i didn t see it
happening like this 
why the hell do we still do it 
it s in our nature to save them 
  it s what we do 
  right 
 cherish your life  
  what 
  the fucking motto 
we re supposed to cherish
our lives 
how the hell are we
supposed to do that
when this is our life 
we chose this 
  you go home 
  hoffman  there are two agents
  here to see you 
  copy 
  detective hoffman 
  yes 
i m special agent lindsey perez 
this is special agent peter strahm 
how can i help the fbi 
we re here about detective kerry 
she was our liaison 
 open the door
and you will find me  
what 
  what s this 
  the key that came
with out last message
from detective kerry 
 open the door and you will find me 
mean anything to you 
no 
where s the body 
the crime scene photographer s flash
picked up this bullet casing 
it was lodged between the body
and the device 
run it for prints 
give us the room for a minute 
would you  thanks 
the lock was open 
she couldn t get out 
it was constructed for her execution 
betrayed the rules 
not a jigsaw trap then 
no  amanda young 
the accomplice   
  this wasn t done by amanda young 
  excuse me 
detective kerry weighed
approximately 130 lbs 
amanda young s arrest report
has her at 107 
  she couldn t get her up there alone 
  john kramer was   
the bedridden cancer patient 
he s brains  not brawn 
he was also an engineer 
he could have rigged pulleys   
or someone else
could have helped him 
special agent  if you re here for any
other reason than just to assist   
we re here to find the person
your department couldn t  detective 
the one helping jigsaw
and amanda young 
excuse me 
we found a harlequin doll in your
possession  what s that about 
it s a toy 
the kids play with toys 
that s all it is 
how about the tricycle 
the tricycle is from john s youth 
a grown man has
a tricycle his whole life 
i m sure you ve kept things
that were important to you 
look  ms  tuck 
is there any reason
we should be concerned
for your safety 
perhaps you should be
more concerned for yourself 
why don t you tell me
everything you know about john 
and let s start at the beginning 
john s life defies chronology
and linear description 
so why don t we start at the end
and work our way backwards 
i represent ms  tuck 
she knows something 
i thought you were going home 
you have vacation time  right 
take it 
finish the remodeling 
spend some time with tracy 
  she understands 
  then don t take her for granted 
  eric is still out there  man 
  eric s been missing for six months 
kerry was gone for four days 
i can only be as optimistic
  as the facts allow 
  yeah  well  i m in it till i find him 
finding his body is not gonna
vindicate us 
finding him alive will 
it s time to let go 
i want you to go home 
i ll call you later to make sure
everything is okay 
who s he 
lieutenant rigg 
our swat commander 
  what s his problem 
  everyone around him keeps dying 
what s it say 
it says   i tried calling you
four times  
it says   dinner is in the fridge  
and at the bottom it says 
 i love you  
i need to help my mom
for a few days 
just   
come with me  okay  now 
i can t 
you can 
but you won t 
what you can t do
is save everyone 
tracy 
tracy  please listen to me 
john kramer owned a company called
the urban renewal group 
no irony in that  huh 
what was rigg watching 
jill tuck s interrogation 
she was jigsaw s ex  it s old 
why is a swat guy watching that 
strahm  i really think
we should tell hoffman
what detective kerry said
in her last message 
she said two officers
might be in danger 
but until we know who 
we re not causing a panic 
if detective hoffman or anyone else
in this precinct is in danger 
  i think they should know it 
  not your call 
making any progress 
we re fine  thanks 
hey  boss  looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital 
  maybe it s   
  thanks 
i ll check it out 
if you need me  call my cell 
coffee machine is around the corner 
  a boy or a girl 
  a girl 
  i didn t know you were married 
  i m not 
it s a short story  believe me 
tracy 
tracy 
hello  officer rigg 
welcome to your rebirth 
fuck 
for years you ve stood by
and witnessed
as your colleagues have fallen 
you have remained untouched
while eric matthews
has disappeared 
but with your survival
came your obsession   
obsession to stop
those around you
from making the wrong choices 
thus preventing you
from making the right ones 
you wanted to save everyone 
tonight i give you
the opportunity
to face your obsession 
look closely 
eric matthews is still alive 
  eric 
  the block of ice he stands upon
is melting 
he has but 90 minutes
to save himself 
detective hoffman s fate is linked
to eric s survival 
heed my warning 
officer rigg 
their lives hang in the balance
of your obsession 
will you learn how to let go
and truly save them 
the choice is yours 
don t fucking move 
jesus 
take off the mask 
put your hands in the air 
i can t 
officer rigg  your first test 
the person in front of you
is in desperate need of help 
but it is not your job
to save them 
you view this person as a victim 
but if you want to see what i see 
beneath the mask lies a criminal
undeserving of the life she leads 
your obsession tells you
to save the victim 
i tell you to walk away 
the choice is yours 
  are you a cop 
  what 
  are you a cop 
  yeah  i m a cop 
what is that 
what did you do 
  they re in the gears

  fisk 
  not now 
we just got a call of  shots fired 
from 23 park place 
that s rigg s apartment 
hello  brenda 
i want to play a game 
an officer will try to save you 
if he is successful 
then your game begins 
this man will use these photos
to sentence you for your crimes 
and the only way to stop him
is taped underneath the tv 
let him save your life
and accept your fate
to rot in prison 
or kill him
and guarantee your freedom 
make your choice 
i ll fucking kill you 
you fucking bitch 
rigg 
  rigg  you in here  rigg

strahm   
two detectives  you see this 
hoffman    you got a 20 on him 
not yet 
  hoffman 
  calling 
how do you explain
detective matthews 
  he s alive 
  six months 
  jigsaw never kept anyone that long 
  no one but amanda young 
you think he s been fixed 
why these six 
hoffman s a decorated lieutenant 
he doesn t fit the profile 
that s what you see 
but what does he see 
  rigg trying to save his two friends 
  maybe 
you got names and locations
on any of these people 
  working it 
  this is overkill 
it s a setup to announce
rigg is the accomplice 
or a setup for his alibi 
everyone around him keeps dying 
where is he to tell us he s innocent
or what the hell these photos
are doing in his apartment 
look there 
move  please 
 four walls build a home  
what does he want us to see
on these walls 
the victims

in the next room are the tools
to his salvation 
his life is in your hands 
but in the end

designed to help people

that part of john
has nothing to do with me 
look  ms  tuck 
i just left a room
with more blood on the walls
than paint 
two officers are missing and
there s a growing pile of bodies
in their wake 
and every detail we unearth
about your hall of fame
psychopath husband   
  ex 
   points to you
as a possible accomplice 
i am just curious as to why 
you know  there s a lot of people
out there
looking for answers 
wanting to place blame
on someone 
that person is you 
but you know
what the best part is 
i don t have to
convince everybody

or a perpetrator of violence

to face his demons
and let him make the decision

hello  officer rigg 
if you are hearing this 
then you have reached
detective matthews
and detective hoffman
in under 90 minutes 
resulting in their deaths 
the rules were clear 
you were warned 
  it s kerry 
  do not go through that door 
you know never to go
through an unsecured door  ever 
tonight you face your obsession 
what you can t do
is save everyone 
will you learn how to let go 
  eric is still out there  man 
  it s time to let go 
detective matthews has
but 90 minutes 
i recommend you stay alive
until the fucking clock
counts down 
they had to save themselves 
take  em 
their salvation was
out of your hands 
time was on your side 
but your obsession
wouldn t let you wait 
instead of saving
detective matthews 
you cost him his life 
you failed your final test 
what i don t understand is
how the hell could jigsaw do all this 
he was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him 
i m not so sure he did 
  this wasn t done by amanda young 
  excuse me 
  she couldn t get her up there alone 
  john kramer was   
he s brains  not brawn 
we re here to find the person
helping jigsaw and amanda young 
looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital 
you go home 
we chose this 
game over 
you feel you now have control 
don t you 
you think you will
walk away untested 
i promise that my work
will continue 
that i have ensured 
by hearing this tape
some will assume
that this is over
