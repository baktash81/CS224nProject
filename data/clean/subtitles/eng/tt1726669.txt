  jesus 
no  just hear me out 
every goddamn time 
what about the farm 
leave the farm out of it 
i m talking about something
way easier than that 
ugh 
this ought to be good 
you ever hear of joe cooper 
  no 
  he s a cop 
a detective  actually 
okay
he s got a little business
on the side
what s he do 
he s a killer  he kills people 
yeah  so 
mom s got
a  50 000 life insurance policy 
don t look at me like that 
well  who s the   
what do you call it 
beneficiary 
  dottie 
  dottie 
  the whole thing  the whole  50 000 
  yup 
she didn t leave nothing to me 
of course not  you dipshit
why would she do that 
i m her ex husband 
she hates you  dad  you know that 
how much something like that cost 
well  i hear he charges 20 
thousand  jesus 
listen  this isn t really something
we can cut corners on 
i d say it s worth it
not to get caught 
i mean  killer joe s a professional
he ll do this right 
how do you know 
who told you about this 
never mind that 
i want to hire him on spec
ask him to do it for free
and then give him
a out of the insurance money 
well  after we pay this guy
 and we clear  30 000
 30 thousand 
  we split it four ways
  three ways 
  how do you figure 
  you  me and dottie 
what about sharla 
what about her 
she gets a cut 
the heh she does she ain t family 
she s been my wife
longer than adele was 
it s less money 
it s less money for you 
and it s more money for you 
i m the father here 
i found her she s my ex wife 
not you not dottie 
okay  fine 
we ll just split it four ways 
i ain t agreed to nothing  okay 
this is murder we re talking about 
i m not just gonna stand here
nodding my head
look at it this way 
is she doing anybody any good 
what do you mean 
is anybody gonna care
if mom s not around any more 
yeah  rex 
son of a bitch screws
anything draws breath 
  thai doesn t mean he doesn t care 
  he d be tickled pink
you should see the way
she treats that poor bastard 
probably about the same way
she treated me 
what s better for dottie 
having  10 000 
so she can go to that amazon school
or having a beat up 
old  ugly  naggy alcoholic mother
for another 20 years or so 
  i see your point 
  exactly
so long as dottie never knows
what we re talking about 
we re really doing her a favour 
yeah 
what are you doing here 
got in a fight with mom 
you built this city all by yourself 
yeah 
sure did 
brick by brick 
i heard that at the wedding 
scared the shit out of me 
sleep talking gives me the creeps 
yeah  gotten worse 
about every night 
she s not seeing anybody yet 
don t hold your breath 
truth be told 
i think she s still a    you know 
what 
a virgin 
let me just call him 
and at least just set up a meet
and talk to the guy 
we don t got to decide anything
right now 
  okay 
  okay  good 
i heard y all talking
about killing momma 
i think ifs a good idea 
well  there you go 
this is murder we re talking about 
that looks hard 
who are you 
joe cooper  joe cooper 
you scared me to death 
excuse me 
and i apologise 
i knocked on the door 
but you had the tv on too loud
to hear me 
so i decided to let myself in 
it s okay 
that looks hard  from a tv like that 
you should have a teacher 
i m joe cooper 
i m supposed to meet chris here
at 10 30 
he s not here 
well  i m a little early 
he s usually late 
could i trouble you
for a cup of coffee 
sure 
why don t you sit down
and i ll take your jacket 
mmm hmm  thank you 
can i ask your name 
i m dottie 
hello  dottie 
hi 
what 
what are you 
i mean  what do you do 
i m a detective 
  really 
  mmm hmm 
like magnum  p i  
no 
he s a private detective 
i m in the dallas police department 
  he ain t real  either
  no 
i m real 
i read it s nothing like them shows
with car chases and all 
a lot of paperwork 
i read some policemen
go their whole lives
without shooting their guns 
probably true 
  you ever drawn your gun 
  oh  sure 
you ever shot anybody 
  yes 
  who 
nobody you d know 
did they die 
well  they have  yes 
wow 
what s the most exciting thing
that s ever happened 
hmm 
i went into this house 
i heard an awful screaming
coming from
inside in the back 
and it was pitch dark 
so i followed the sound of the scream
back to a bedroom 
all right  i didn t know
what the hell to expect 
yeah 
when i opened the door
suddenly just    whap 
there s this huge  fat man
was on top of me 
  screaming and kicking and clawing
  oh  my god 
and the thing was 
there was nobody else even there 
and he wasn t trying to hurt me
he wanted me to help him 
why 
see  he got into a fight
with his girlfriend  right 
she d been having an affair  so   
in order to teach her a lesson 
that s what he said 
 teach her a lesson  
he doused his genitals
with lighter fluid
and he set them on fire 
you believe that 
it s true 
that poor miserable bastard
set his own genitals on fire
just to teach his girlfriend
a lesson 
i guess he showed her 
i wonder if she ever got over it 
  was he all right 
  no 
no  he was not all right 
he set his genitals on fire 
i had an aunt
who set herself on fire once 
yeah 
not on purpose  though 
she was wearing this long lace dress
and she got it caught in the furnace 
she died
before they could put the fire out 
really 
they say she s the one
in the family i look the most like 
her name was vivah 
isn t that a pretty name 
mmm hmm 
i don t think
she ever got married  though 
you gonna answer that 
it s for you 
my dad couldn t get away from work 
i was wondering if you could meet us
at bob s muffler 
there s some place private
where we can talk 
there s a pool hall next door 
out of business 
just off harry hines 
bring dottie 
she ll show you the way 
don t change plans on me again 
listen  i m really sorry 
could you try
to make a little more noise 
why don t you try kissing my ass 
son of a bitch 
are you gonna kill my momma 
i don t know 
  why 
  i was just curious 
my momma tried to kill me
when i was real little 
she put a pillow over my face 
because she cared more about herself
than her little baby 
she didn t love me like a momma
should love a little baby 
and she was happy 
because she thought she d  done it 
and then i couldn t grow into
something better than she d been 
had ever been 
she hadn t done it 
she didn t send me back to him 
she just made me sick 
made me not be for a while 
but then i was 
she was sad that i was
and i always will be 
how do you know that 
know what 
that your mother tried to kill you 
 cause i remember 
this is my father  ansel 
ansel 
like a beer 
no  no  thank you  look 
i don t have a lot of time  so   
all right let s get right to it 
if that s all right 
all right  well  first off 
me and my father
never done nothing like this before 
we don t want to do it 
but ifs got to be done 
that s got nothing to do with me 
all right 
well  sir
instead of me kicking this off 
maybe you could tell us the questions
 we need to ask
  it s pretty simple 
you re gonna pay me for a service
that i m going to perform 
uh huh 
you re going to give me
the particulars of her schedule 
her habits 
i ll act on them accordingly 
i won t give you many details
on my activities 
because the less you know 
the better for everyone involved 
all right 
now i only have a couple of rules
that i insist on sticking to 
  insist 
  okay  yeah 
if you re caught 
if you re implicated in this crime 
you are not under any circumstances
to reveal
my identity or participation 
oh  of course 
if you break this rule 
you ll be killed 
do you understand 
  i   
  i must be absolutely clear
on this point 
i understand 
do you understand 
yeah 
my payment is  25 000 in cash
in advance 
no exceptions 
 25 
  yes  sir 
  i thought you said 20 
  i was told 20 
25 
is that a problem 
we don t have a problem with 25
that s not our problem 
then what is your problem 
we have a problem with the advance 
  no exceptions 
  sir  let me explain 
one of the reasons
we re interested in having this done
is my mother holds
a very large insurance policy 
they usually do 
now we thought
if we can guarantee payment
after the policy has been covered   
look  this really isn t open
for discussion 
  the conversation is finished 
  please  this isn t   
what d you think this was 
let s make a deal 
this is serious business
you re fucking with here  boy 
  i m aware of that 
  no  i don t think you are 
i don t take you seriously 
this is gonna get done
one way or another 
our conversation is finished 
i never met you 
you never met me 
oi course  we never discussed
the possibility of a retainer

you fish the north bank 
you caught okie fish

  chris 
that chris is so stupid  i could
have told you he d fuck this up 
  why didn t you 
  why didn t i 
it s just an expression  really 
what is 
what she said  that she could
have told you chris would fuck it up 
i ve never heard of that expression 
  a manner of speaking  really 
  i never liked that little bastard 
  you haven t 
  mmm mmm 
he s just no good 
you can t trust him 
  you never really hit it off
  all he cares about is himself 
  that s not fair 
  bullshit fair  it s true 
it s really all anybody cares about
if you think about it 
  no wonder 
  no wonder what 
no wonder chris wound up
the way he did 
  what the fuck did i do 
  just shut up 
i mean  how stupid do you have to be
to let an idiot like rex
take advantage 
  rex 
  yeah  rex 
  what about rex 
  i said   
i said  how stupid do you have to be
to let an idiot like rex
 take advantage 
  yes  i heard what you said 
  tell me about rex 
  rex is adele s boyfriend 
was 
was adele s boyfriend 
tell me about rex 
  what do you want to know 
  not you
  you 
  what 
you  tell me about rex 
what do you mean 
now  you know the man  don t you 
i mean  you have met
  yeah  of course 
  tell me about him 
i don t know what you mean 
is he tall  is he fat  is he chinese 
where does he work  how old is he 
do his ears hang low 
is he unlike other men 
tell me about rex
rex 15  
i don t get this  really 
who told you about our arrangement 
what arrangement 
the contract between
myself and this family 
  ansel 
  why 
well  she is my wife  joe 
  i wasn t addressing you  sir 
  okay 
  why did he tell you 
  i m his wife  like he said 
were you gonna get
a cut of this money 
  sure 
  why 
 cause i m his wife  like he said 
did you advise ansel
against the idea 
no 
why 
you could have told him
chris would fuck it up 
it s none of my business 
but it is  isn t it 
i mean  it is your business 
what are you getting at 
if you were going to
share in the money 
then it is your business  isn t it 
yeah  i don t know 
yet you did moi advise ansel 
your husband  against it
look  i wanted some of that money
all right  
if chris could pull this off 
then i   
were you gonna split ansel s share
or were the four of you
gonna split it evenly 
  we didn t discuss that 
  i m sure you did 
you re a practical woman 
well  i assumed
that i would take a fourth 
not one half of one third 
  no  a fourth  four ways 
  instead of one sixths 
one sixths 
no  four ways 
so the remainder of the money
would be split evenly
after i d been paid my fee 
  25 000 
  right  right  right 
  yeah  right after you were covered
  which means equal shares 
what would those four equal shares
come outta  
  i haven t done the math 
  well  then do it with me  right now 
the insurance policy gets covered 
the agent filpatrick
cuts ansel a cheque 
dottie that would be dottie 
right  best of all
possible worlds  dottie 
look  i don t know
why we re doing all this 
we re not gonna see
any of that money 
just watch my feet here  all right 
ah  mmm 
  so ansel gets the cheque 
  dome 
  dottie 
  look  if the cheque is for 100 
we pay you 25 
  how much 
 25 
how much  though  the policy is for 
however much  how much 
 50 thousand 
  that much 
 50 minus your 25
  right  minus my 25 
but you said 100  didn t you 
yeah  however much  minus your money 
no  but you said 100 
  yeah  however much 
  the cheque is for 100 
  however much
  but you said 100 
however much  minus your 25 
she was mistaken  joe  it s 50 
all right 
is it 
yeah

or placement of the blame 
i hold you all equally responsible 
reach around and grab my ass 
reach around and grab my ass 
there you go  grab it  that s it 
i was fortunate

that retainer is now mine 
it belongs to me

when i leave 
you re very good at this
