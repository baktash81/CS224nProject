a 50000 life insurance policy
dont look at me like that
well whos the
what do you call it
beneficiary
dottie
dottie
the whole thing the whole 50000
yup
she didnt leave nothing to me
of course not you dipshit
why would she do that
im her exhusband
she hates you dad you know that
how much something like that cost
well i hear he charges 20
thousand jesus
listen this isnt really something
we can cut corners on
id say its worth it
not to get caught
i mean killer joes a professional
hell do this right
how do you know
who told you about this
never mind that
i want to hire him on spec
ask him to do it for free
and then give him
a out of the insurance money
well after we pay this guy
and we clear 30000
30 thousand
we split it four ways
three ways
how do you figure
you me and dottie
what about sharla
what about her
she gets a cut
the heh she does she aint family
shes been my wife
longer than adele was
its less money
its less money for you
and its more money for you
im the father here
i found her shes my exwife
not you not dottie
okay fine
well just split it four ways
i aint agreed to nothing okay
this is murder were talking about
im not just gonna stand here
nodding my head
look at it this way
is she doing anybody any good
what do you mean
is anybody gonna care
if moms not around any more
yeah rex
son of a bitch screws
anything draws breath
thai doesnt mean he doesnt care
hed be tickled pink
you should see the way
she treats that poor bastard
probably about the same way
she treated me
whats better for dottie
having 10000
so she can go to that amazon school
or having a beatup
old ugly naggy alcoholic mother
for another 20 years or so
i see your point
exactly
so long as dottie never knows

i read its nothing like them shows
with car chases and all
a lot of paperwork
i read some policemen

without shooting their guns
probably true
you ever drawn your gun
oh sure

yes
who
nobody youd know
did they die
well they have yes
wow
whats the most exciting thing
thats ever happened
hmm
i went into this house
i heard an awful screaming
coming from
inside in the back
and it was pitch dark
so i followed the sound of the scream
back to a bedroom
all right i didnt know
what the hell to expect
yeah
when i opened the door
suddenly just whap
theres this huge fat man
was on top of me
screaming and kicking and clawing
oh my god
and the thing was
there was nobody else even there
and he wasnt trying to hurt me
he wanted me to help him
why
see he got into a fight
with his girlfriend right
shed been having an affair so
in order to teach her a lesson
thats what he said
teach her a lesson
he doused his genitals
with lighter fluid
and he set them on fire
you believe that
its true
that poor miserable bastard
set his own genitals on fire
just to teach his girlfriend
a lesson
i guess he showed her
i wonder if she ever got over it
was he all right
no
no he was not all right
he set his genitals on fire
i had an aunt
who set herself on fire once
yeah
not on purpose though
she was wearing this long lace dress
and she got it caught in the furnace
she died
before they could put the fire out
really
they say shes the one
in the family i look the most like
her name was vivah
isnt that a pretty name
mmmhmm
i dont think
she ever got married though
you gonna answer that
its for you
my dad couldnt get away from work
i was wondering if you could meet us
at bobs muffler
theres some place private
where we can talk
theres a pool hall next door
out of business
just off harry hines
bring dottie
shell show you the way
dont change plans on me again
listen im really sorry
could you try
to make a little more noise
why dont you try kissing my ass
son of a bitch
are you gonna kill my momma
i dont know
why
i was just curious
my momma tried to kill me
when i was real little
she put a pillow over my face
because she cared more about herself
than her little baby
she didnt love me like a momma
should love a little baby
and she was happy
because she thought shed done it
and then i couldnt grow into
something better than shed been
had ever been
she hadnt done it
she didnt send me back to him
she just made me sick
made me not be for a while
but then i was
she was sad that i was
and i always will be
how do you know that
know what
that your mother tried to kill you
cause i remember
this is my father ansel
ansel
like a beer
no no thank you look
i dont have a lot of time so
all right lets get right to it
if thats all right
all right well first off
me and my father
never done nothing like this before
we dont want to do it
but ifs got to be done
thats got nothing to do with me
all right
well sir
instead of me kicking this off
maybe you could tell us the questions
we need to ask
its pretty simple
youre gonna pay me for a service
that im going to perform
uhhuh
youre going to give me
the particulars of her schedule
her habits
ill act on them accordingly
i wont give you many details
on my activities
because the less you know
the better for everyone involved
all right
now i only have a couple of rules
that i insist on sticking to
insist
okay yeah
if youre caught
if youre implicated in this crime
you are not under any circumstances
to reveal
my identity or participation
oh of course
if you break this rule
youll be killed
do you understand
i
i must be absolutely clear
on this point
i understand
do you understand
yeah
my payment is 25000 in cash
in advance
no exceptions
yes sir
i thought you said 20
i was told 20
is that a problem
we dont have a problem with 25
thats not our problem
then what is your problem
we have a problem with the advance
no exceptions
sir let me explain
one of the reasons
were interested in having this done
is my mother holds
a very large insurance policy
they usually do
now we thought
if we can guarantee payment
after the policy has been covered

for discussion
the conversation is finished

whatd you think this was

i dont know what to say
you dont have to say anything
its not your fault
yeah but
chris
that chris is so stupid i could
have told you hed fuck this up
why didnt you
why didnt i
its just an expression really
what is
what she said that she could
have told you chris would fuck it up
ive never heard of that expression
a manner of speaking really
i never liked that little bastard
you havent
mmmmmm
hes just no good
you cant trust him
you never really hit it off
all he cares about is himself
thats not fair
bullshit fair its true
its really all anybody cares about
if you think about it
no wonder
no wonder what
no wonder chris wound up
the way he did
what the fuck did i do
just shut up
i mean how stupid do you have to be
to let an idiot like rex
take advantage
rex
yeah rex
what about rex
i said
i said how stupid do you have to be
to let an idiot like rex
take advantage
yes i heard what you said
tell me about rex
rex is adeles boyfriend
was
was adeles boyfriend
tell me about rex
what do you want to know
not you
you
what
you tell me about rex
what do you mean
now you know the man dont you
i mean you have met
yeah of course
tell me about him
i dont know what you mean
is he tall is he fat is he chinese
where does he work how old is he
do his ears hang low
is he unlike other men
tell me about rex
rex 15
i dont get this really
who told you about our arrangement
what arrangement
the contract between
myself and this family
ansel
why
well she is my wife joe
i wasnt addressing you sir
okay
why did he tell you
im his wife like he said
were you gonna get
a cut of this money
sure
why
cause im his wife like he said
did you advise ansel
against the idea
no
why
you could have told him
chris would fuck it up
its none of my business
but it is isnt it
i mean it is your business
what are you getting at
if you were going to
share in the money
then it is your business isnt it
yeah i dont know
yet you did moi advise ansel
your husband against it
look i wanted some of that money
all right
if chris could pull this off
then i
were you gonna split ansels share
or were the four of you
gonna split it evenly
we didnt discuss that
im sure you did
youre a practical woman
well i assumed
that i would take a fourth
not onehalf of onethird
no a fourth four ways
instead of onesixths
onesixths
no four ways
so the remainder of the money
would be split evenly
after id been paid my fee
right right right
yeah right after you were covered
which means equal shares
what would those four equal shares
come outta
i havent done the math
well then do it with me right now
the insurance policy gets covered
the agent filpatrick
cuts ansel a cheque
dottie that would be dottie
right best of all
possible worlds dottie
look i dont know
why were doing all this
were not gonna see
any of that money
just watch my feet here all right
ah mmm
so ansel gets the cheque
dome
dottie
look if the cheque is for 100
we pay you 25
how much
how much though the policy is for
however much how much
50 thousand
that much
50 minus your 25
right minus my 25
but you said 100 didnt you
yeah however much minus your money
no but you said 100
yeah however much
the cheque is for 100
however much
but you said 100
however much minus your 25
she was mistaken joe its 50

or placement of the blame
i hold you all equally responsible
reach around and grab my ass
reach around and grab my ass
there you go grab it thats it
i was fortunate

and since my cash is not forthcoming
that retainer is now mine
it belongs to me
