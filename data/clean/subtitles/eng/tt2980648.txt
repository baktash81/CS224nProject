is that the french way
i dont know
how did you learn about all this stuff

which is bechamel veloute
hollandaise tomato espagnole
you have to master
those five basic sauces first

you must find them in your heart
and then bring them to your pots
thats the secret
marguerite
hello

that she knows in just one mouthful
if a chef has the potential to be great
when someone comes to apply for a job
she never interviews them she um

and then her tongue decides
oui ou non
thats it

yes
madame mallory well
there are other ways to be french
liberty equality fraternity
why are you talking only to me
because you know who set the fire
dont you
would you surrender to these invaders
you tell your friends
that these bombs have ended a war
they have brought peace
bravo
youre a chef
i do not pay you to burn things
take your knives and go
speaking french
breathing heavily
not enough cardamom
arrey not enough gratitude
you know
i think its time we got rid of these
why
its about good food its just different
dont be afraid
you know they hate us
arent you angry
no
jeanpierre shouting in french
hassan were not visitors anymore
mahira
this time we will not run
engine starts
you know what they say
if you cant beat them join them
sighs
i can clean my own wall
the outer wall is not your wall
technically it belongs to the village
ask the mayor
i know because i had the clever plan
to have it raised many feet
so nobody could see your restaurant
merci
madam
i would like to
i would like to make you an omelet
would you be interested
but id need your help to break the eggs
inaudible
oh
speaking french
chuckles
you have it
hmm
your pigeon had it too
i know
i knew then and i know now
hmm
arrogance
a chef must lead
mmmhmm
sharp and cool and hot in the mouth
all at the same time
do you know how long
it takes chefs to learn that
what will papa say
speaking hindi
papa it would only be a sixmonth trial
mama would want this
speaking hindi
ill get a more classical training
dont you want that for me
india is not classical
we are the oldest civilization
in the world
she thinks she owns everybody in town
do you hear me up there i say no
dont try to steal my children
i will report you mr kadam
for making too much noise
and i will report you
for attempted child abduction
have you even asked the boy
what he wants
you deliberately seduced him
scoffs
you seduced his mind
with your awful tasteless
empty sauces
with your pitiful little
squashed bits of garlic
that is called subtlety of flavor
its called meanness of spirit
if you have a spice use it
dont sprinkle it spoon it in
madame mallory what you do not seem to understand
is that there is such a thing as enough
enough is enough arrêtez
papa yes enough of you
always up there like a queen
or something
you tell him its classical
what is classical
classical comes from the word class
and that is what he will learn
in my kitchen
he will learn how to cook with class
indian cannot become french
and the french cannot become indian
mr kadam
i think i have just spent the whole day
washing those words off your wall
door creaking
excuse me
madame mallory
were actually closed
yes
is there
anything i can help you with
no
its just that i was wondering what
you were
im waiting
waiting for what

im glad that our brakes failed here
maybe brakes break for a reason
what do you mean
what am i going to do
you should just go
its okay
go
car door closes
paul hassan you have reached
the very highest level of cuisine
up here cooking is no longer an art
its a science
at la baleine grise
we believe that eating
is a multisensory experience
and certain combinations
of flavors and aromas
activate enzymes
and stimulate specific parts of the brain
evoking pleasure
and also recollections
of pleasurable experiences
like a certain scent
will remind you of your first love
hassan yes with food you remember
this is the beast
with a thousand mouths
that must be fed twice a day
and what does the beast like
innovation
innovation
innovation
hissing
female critic 1 la baleine grise has always
been known for experimental
food combinations
but on my most recent visit
the oysters with nitro pearls
of sturgeon and oyster dust
were made exceptional
by the addition
of ground cardamom seeds
cardamom
male critic 1 while its only been a few months
since my last visit
i was pleasantly surprised
by the appearance of coriander
fenugreek and masala
female critic 2 glutinous sauce resonant of tandoori
this was a surprising triumph
male critic 2 the most unexpected ways
with a marinade of tamarind
and smoked chili
the fish swims into my top five
of all time
its sugarcoated beetroot with carrots
also garam masala
male critic 3 an established
molecular cuisine favorite
in beaubourg
appears to have discovered
the spice of life
madame mallory cauliflower ice cream
with a skim of egg yolk and capers

the restaurants regeneration
is mostly down
to a young chef from india
