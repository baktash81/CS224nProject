and i started with the five basics 
which is bechamel  veloute 
hollandaise  tomato  espagnole 
you have to master
those five basic sauces first 
and you can find all five in the books 
of course  but they re no use in books 
you must find them in your heart 
and then bring them to your pots 
that s the secret 
marguerite 
  hello 
  come here 
voila 
the five sauces of french cuisine 
 chuckles  i can see that 
but you have to try it with the veal 
which i made 
 stammering  you made this 
yeah  try it 
tomate  veloute  hollandaise 
espagnole  bechamel 
 chuckles 
um  you know  madame mallory says
that she knows in just one mouthful
if a chef has the potential to be great 
when someone comes to apply for a job 
she never interviews them  she  um   
she asks them to make her an omelet 
and she takes one bite of the omelet 
and then her tongue decides 
oui ou non 
that s it 
and 
oui 
 chuckling  it s incroyable 
it s   
it s incroyable 
 chuckles

why not 
because  um   
because we do the same job 
and you know how it is 
you know  we get very long days 
and we never sleep
and we have no time 
chefs shouldn t be together  i think 
but you think of me as a chef 
  yes

 all clamoring distantly 
madame mallory  thomas 
yes  madame 
call the team together 
i wish to speak with them 
 footsteps approaching 
 madame mallory speaking french 
uh  sit down  please 
do any of you know the words
to the marseillaise 
jean pierre 
of course  it s our national anthem 
do you know all the words 
 reciting in french 
 they come to slit the throats
of our sons  our wives  
 speaking french 
 reciting 
and in english 
so we can all understand 
 to arms  citizens  form your battalions 
let us march  
 may their unpure blood    
 flow in our fields  
and that is what it means to be french 
n est ce pas  jean pierre 
yes 
madame mallory  well 
there are other ways to be french 
liberty  equality  fraternity 
why are you talking only to me 
because you know who set the fire 
don t you 
would you surrender to these invaders 
you tell your friends
that these bombs have ended a war 
they have brought peace 
bravo 
you re a chef 
i do not pay you to burn things 
take your knives and go 
 speaking french 
 breathing heavily 
not enough cardamom 
arrey  not enough gratitude 
you know 
i think it s time we got rid of these 
why 
it s about good food  it s just different 
don t be afraid 
you know they hate us 
aren t you angry 
no 
 jean pierre shouting in french 
hassan  we re not visitors anymore 
mahira 
this time we will not run 
 engine starts 
you know what they say 
if you can t beat them  join them 
 sighs 
i can clean my own wall 
the outer wall is not your wall 
technically  it belongs to the village 
ask the mayor 
i know  because i had the clever plan
to have it raised many feet
so nobody could see your restaurant 
merci 
madam 
i would like to   
i would like to make you an omelet 
would you be interested 
but i d need your help to break the eggs 
 inaudible 
oh 
 speaking french 
 chuckles 
you have it 
hmm 
your pigeon had it  too 
i know 
i knew then  and i know now 
hmm 
arrogance 
a chef must lead 
mmm hmm 
sharp and cool and hot in the mouth 
all at the same time 
do you know how long
it takes chefs to learn that 
what will papa say 
 speaking hindi 
papa  it would only be a six month trial 
mama would want this 
 speaking hindi 
i ll get a more classical training 
don t you want that for me 
india is not classical 
we are the oldest civilization
in the world 
she thinks she owns everybody in town 
do you hear me up there  i say no 
don t try to steal my children 
i will report you  mr  kadam 
for making too much noise 
and i will report you
for attempted child abduction 
have you even asked the boy
what he wants 
you deliberately seduced him 
 scoffs 
you seduced his mind 
with your awful  tasteless 
empty sauces 
with your pitiful little
squashed bits of garlic 
that is called subtlety of flavor 
it s called meanness of spirit 
if you have a spice  use it 
don t sprinkle it  spoon it in 
madame mallory  what you do not seem to understand
is that there is such a thing as enough 
enough is enough  arrêtez 
papa  yes  enough of you 
always up there like a queen
or something 
you tell him  it s  classical  
what is  classical  
 classical  comes from the word  class  
and that is what he will learn
in my kitchen 
he will learn how to cook with class 
indian cannot become french 
and the french cannot become indian 
mr  kadam 
i think i have just spent the whole day
washing those words off your wall 
 door creaking 
excuse me 
madame mallory   
we re actually closed 
yes 
is there
anything i can help you with 
no 
it s just that i was wondering what   
you were   
i m waiting 
waiting for what 
for hassan kadam

papa

what do you mean 
what am i going to do 
you should just go 
it s okay 
go 
 car door closes 
paul  hassan  you have reached
the very highest level of cuisine 
up here  cooking is no longer an art 
it s a science 
at la baleine grise 
we believe that eating
is a multi sensory experience 
and certain combinations
of flavors and aromas
activate enzymes
and stimulate specific parts of the brain 
evoking pleasure 
and also recollections
of pleasurable experiences 
like a certain scent
will remind you of your first love 
hassan  yes  with food you remember 
this is the beast
with a thousand mouths 
that must be fed twice a day 
and what does the beast like 
innovation

female critic 1  la baleine grise has always
been known for experimental
food combinations 
but on my most recent visit 
the oysters with nitro pearls
of sturgeon and oyster dust
were made exceptional
by the addition
of ground cardamom seeds

together 
mr  kadam  excuse me 
but could i take a picture with you
