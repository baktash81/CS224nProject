to a local college 
and even though we
can t afford the dorm 
you get to have me
as your new college roommate

hey 
oh  my god  how weird 
how do they know you re

comfort zone  that s fine 
that s not true  what about
that pole dancing class we took 
vee  i dragged you there
and you sat in the corner and watched 
  i m a visual learner 
  why are you attacking her 
  i m not attacking her  tommy 
  yeah  you are 
life is passing you by 
you need to learn to take a few
risks every once in a while 
  i do take risks

what d be a good
nerve dare for vee 
make out with jp 
baby steps  baby steps 
just talk to jp

he probably likes you  too 
you ll just never know

  and you are a douchebag 
no  don t go  come on 
vee  vee 
just let her go 
not cool  sydney 
i m just trying to help her 
  let s not help her 
  she ll figure it out 
hello  welcome to nerve 
you have chosen player 
nerve is a direct democracy 
watchers decide your dares 
the two players with
the most watchers
by the end of regulation
will advance to the final round
where the winner takes all 
watchers can watch from anywhere
but they are encouraged to film live 
so don t be alarmed 
there are three rules 
one  all dares must be
filmed on the player s phone 
two  there are only two
ways to be eliminated 
fail or bail 
three  snitches get stitches 
thank you for keeping nerve a secret 
good luck  player 
hey  it s vee  i m not here right now   
vee  you have
to sign up and watch me 
   for account information  press one 
for phone or credit card information   
  tommy 
  hey  i m pulling up outside 
what the hell s so urgent 
we have to go to colonnade diner 
we have 15 minutes 
why  what s going on 
i signed up for nerve
and that s where my first dare is 
what do you mean 
you signed up as a player 
oh  man 
what  is that so hard to believe 
you know that some kid supposedly
died in seattle playing nerve 
i don t buy that  if kids were dying 
the game would be shut down 
no  they can t shut it down 
there s not a single server 
what does that mean 
everybody that logs onto
the game becomes a new server 
so it s impossible
to turn the game off 
how do you even know
so much about this game 
you ve never even played 
look  i spend a lot of time
on the dark web  alright 
oh a lot of time on the dark web 
  is that right  hacker boy 
  yes  that is right 
you re only accessing ten percent
of the internet  you know 
why are you even doing this 
seriously  it s dangerous 
is it because of sydney 
this is not about sydney  i m   
it s just not like you 
that s the point 
kiss a stranger for five seconds 
a stranger  vee 
i ll give you 100 dollars 
okay  okay 
you re just gonna
kiss some random person 
he has a girlfriend 
just kiss that guy 
  okay  i m gonna kiss that guy 
  yeah  that s what i m saying 
gonna do it 
or that guy  he reads 
well  make a choice  clock s ticking 
  hi 
  hey 
i m kissing that guy 
okay  you sit here 
tell me when you re rolling  okay 
okay  it s mission impossible now 
just go 
to    to the lighthouse 
that s my favorite book 
really 
please  tell me they get to
the lighthouse in the end 
um   
actually  don t tell me 
okay  just tell me real quick 
yeah  they do  but that s 
that s not really what it s about 
the lighthouse means something
different to each of the characters 
it basically represents the
thing they want most in life 
and i m sorry that i m totally
geeking out and ruining the story 
no  i was the one who asked 
one mississippi 
two mississippi  three mississippi 
four mississippi  five mississippi
