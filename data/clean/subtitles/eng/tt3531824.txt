here we go
you have drive you have focus
you have a scholarship
to a local college
and even though we
cant afford the dorm
you get to have me
as your new college roommate
actually i um i have
kind of a cool idea about that

or a dick liv
theyre coming
up with your next dare
what is it i need something flashy
like the peanut butter thing
hey
oh my god how weird
how do they know youre
afraid of heights
what
thats what they do its easy
they just take all your
info from your old profiles
and put it in your nerve profile
thats so creepy
you just got suspended
i thought you were done playing nerve
hell no
the girl who won seattle now
has millions of followers
she is instafamous
who cares
i care vee
i dont expect you to understand
im an adrenaline junkie
you like to stay within your
comfort zone thats fine
thats not true what about
that pole dancing class we took
vee i dragged you there
and you sat in the corner and watched
im a visual learner
why are you attacking her
im not attacking her tommy
yeah you are
life is passing you by
you need to learn to take a few
risks every once in a while
i do take risks
really
okay fine lets just say
hypothetically youre playing nerve
whatd be a good
nerve dare for vee
make out with jp
baby steps baby steps
just talk to jp
what
he probably likes you too
youll just never know
if you dont talk to him
and then everybody thats watching you
they would just go on and vote
who wants to see
vee mackin on jp
oh my god
you guys
all who wanna see
vee macking on jp say yes
yes
yes yes
i assume no
abstain
thank you
alright youve been dared
do you accept your dare vee
say yes
say yes
whats the point
were graduating i
all you have to do is say hi
i dont want to say hello to him
fine i love you so much vee
but youre a watcher
so watch me do it for you
no no no syd syd syd
just watch
no no no syd no
yeah sydney
why dont you show us

i was wondering do you

youre not nearly
as hot as you think you are
yes he is
and you are a douchebag
no dont go come on
vee vee
just let her go
not cool sydney
im just trying to help her
lets not help her
shell figure it out
hello welcome to nerve
you have chosen player
nerve is a direct democracy
watchers decide your dares
the two players with
the most watchers
by the end of regulation
will advance to the final round
where the winner takes all
watchers can watch from anywhere
but they are encouraged to film live
so dont be alarmed
there are three rules
one all dares must be
filmed on the players phone
two there are only two
ways to be eliminated
fail or bail
three snitches get stitches
thank you for keeping nerve a secret
good luck player
hey its vee im not here right now
vee you have
to sign up and watch me
for account information press one
for phone or credit card information
tommy
hey im pulling up outside
what the hells so urgent
we have to go to colonnade diner
we have 15 minutes
why whats going on
i signed up for nerve
and thats where my first dare is
what do you mean
you signed up as a player
oh man
what is that so hard to believe
you know that some kid supposedly
died in seattle playing nerve
i dont buy that if kids were dying
the game would be shut down
no they cant shut it down
theres not a single server
what does that mean
everybody that logs onto
the game becomes a new server
so its impossible
to turn the game off
how do you even know
so much about this game
youve never even played
look i spend a lot of time
on the dark web alright
oh a lot of time on the dark web
is that right hacker boy
yes that is right
youre only accessing ten percent
of the internet you know
why are you even doing this
seriously its dangerous
is it because of sydney
this is not about sydney im
its just not like you
thats the point
kiss a stranger for five seconds
a stranger vee
ill give you 100 dollars
okay okay
youre just gonna
kiss some random person
he has a girlfriend
just kiss that guy
okay im gonna kiss that guy
yeah thats what im saying
gonna do it
or that guy he reads
well make a choice clocks ticking
hi
hey
im kissing that guy
okay you sit here
tell me when youre rolling okay
okay its mission impossible now
just go
to to the lighthouse
thats my favorite book
really
please tell me they get to
the lighthouse in the end
um
actually dont tell me
okay just tell me real quick
yeah they do but thats
thats not really what its about
the lighthouse means something
different to each of the characters
it basically represents the
thing they want most in life
and im sorry that im totally
geeking out and ruining the story
no i was the one who asked
one mississippi
two mississippi three mississippi
four mississippi five mississippi
