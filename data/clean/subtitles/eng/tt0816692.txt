of course he didnt start that way
distant rumbling
alarm beeping
man over radio
computer says youre too tight
nah i got this
crossing the straights
shutting it down cooper
no
shutting it all down
no i need power up
cooper yells
girl
dad
panting
sorry murph go back to bed
i thought you were the ghost
no
there are no such things as ghosts babe
grandpa says you can get ghosts
maybe thats because grandpas close
to being one himself back to bed
were you dreaming about the crash
get your butt back in bed murph heh
woman 1
the wheat had died
the blight came and we had to burn it
and we still had corn we had acres of corn
but uh mostly we had dust
woman 2
i guess i cant describe it it was just constant
just that steady blow
of dirt
woman 3
we wore um little strips of sheet
sometimes over our nose and mouth
so that we wouldnt breathe so much of it
man when we set the table
we always set the plate
upsidedown
glasses or cups whatever it was
upsidedown
shake a leg murph get a move on
tom 400 today you and me in the barn
herbicide resistance 101
check
yes sir
not at the table murph
dad can you fix this
cooper
what the heck did you do
to my lander
wasnt me
let me guess it was your ghost
it knocked it off
it keeps knocking books off
tom
no such thing as ghosts dumbass
hey
i looked it up its called a poltergeist
dad tell her
well its not very scientific murph
you said science was about admitting
what we dont know
shes got you there
hey
start looking after our stuff
coop
all right murph you want to talk science
dont tell me youre afraid of some ghost
no you got to go further
you got to record the facts analyze
get to the how and the why
then present your conclusions deal
deal
all right
have a good day at school
man hold up
parentteacher conferences parent
not grandparent
horn honking
slow down turbo
thats not a dust storm
nelsons torching his whole crop
blight
man
theyre saying its the last harvest for okra
ever
he shouldve planted corn like the rest of us
now be nice to that miss hanley shes single
whats that supposed to mean
repopulating the earth
start pulling your weight young man
why dont you start
minding your own business old man
all right murph give me second
uhhuh
third
gears grinding
find a gear dumbass
grind it
shut it tom
whatd you do murph
ah she didnt do nothing
blew a tire is all
murphys law
shut up
grab the spare tom
that is the spare
cooper
get the patch kit
tom how am i supposed to patch it out here
cooper you got to figure it out
im not always gonna be here to help you
whats going on murph
why did you and mom name me
after something thats bad
we didnt
murphys law
murphys law doesnt mean
that something bad will happen
what it means is
whatever can happen will happen
and that sounded just fine with us
whirring
whoa
get in
get in lets go
what about the flat tire
yeah
its an indian air force drone
solar cells could power an entire farm
take the wheel tom
go go go
keep that aimed right at it
faster tom im losing it
right at it
stay on it
here we go
whoa
nice one tom
dad
i almost got it dont stop dont stop
dad
tom
tires screech
you told me to keep driving
well i guess that answers the old
if i asked you to drive off a cliff scenario
we lost it
no we didnt
want to give it a whirl
this way
go
lets lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir
nicely done
tom
how long you think its been up there
cooper delhi mission control went down
same as ours
ten years ago
heh
so for ten years
why did it come down so low
i dont know
maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something
what
give me a large flatblade
maybe some kind of signal i dont know
what are you gonna do with it
im gonna give it something
socially responsible to do
like drive a combine
cant we just let it go
it wasnt hurting anybody
this thing needs to learn
how to adapt murph
like the rest of us
cooper hows this work
you guys come with
tom
ive got class
this one needs to wait
what did you do
theyll tell you about it in there
am i gonna be mad
not with me
just please try not to
hey relax
i got this
little late coop
yeah we had a flat
and i guess you had to stop off
at the asian fighter plane store
no actually sir thats a surveillance drone
with outstanding solar cells its indian
take a seat
so uh
we got toms scores back
hes going to make an excellent farmer
yeah hes got a knack for it
what about college
the university only takes a handful
they dont have the resources to
i still pay my taxes
wheres that money go
theres no more armies
well it doesnt go to the university
look coop you have to be realistic
youre ruling my son out for college now
the kids 15
toms score simply isnt high enough
whats your waistline about what 32
about a 33 inseam
im not sure i see what youre getting at
it takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my sons future
come on youre a welleducated man coop
and a trained pilot
and an engineer
okay well right now
we dont need more engineers
we didnt run out of television screens
and planes we ran out of food
the world needs farmers
good farmers like you
and tom
uneducated farmers
were a caretaker generation coop
and things are getting better
maybe your grandkids will get to be engin
are we done here sir
no
miss hanleys here to talk about murph
hanley
murph is a great kid shes really bright
but shes been having a little trouble lately
she brought this in to show the students
the section on the lunar landings
yeah its one of my old textbooks
she always loved the pictures
its an old federal textbook weve
replaced them with the corrected versions
corrected
explaining how the apollo missions were faked
to bankrupt the soviet union
you dont believe we went to the moon
it was a brilliant piece of propaganda
the soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources
into rockets and other useless machines
useless machines
if we dont want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century then
we need to teach our kids about this planet
not tales of leaving it
one of those useless machines
they used to make was called an mri
if we had any of those left
the doctors wouldve been able to find
the cyst in my wifes brain
before she died instead of afterwards
then shed have been the one
listening to this instead of me
which would have been a good thing
because she was always
the calmer one
im sorry about your wife mr cooper
but murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this
apollo nonsense
so we thought it best
to bring you in and see what ideas
you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front
yeah you know what
um theres a game tomorrow night
shes going through a bit of a baseball phase
her favorite team is playing
theres gonna be candy and soda and
i think ill take her to that
whistling
howd it go
i got you suspended
what
man over radio cooper
this is cooper go
coop those combines you rebuilt
went haywire
just reset the controllers
i did that now you should come take a look
man one by one theyve been
peeling off the fields and heading over
somethings interfering with the compass
magnetism or some such
thudding
murph
nothing special about which book
ive been working on it like you said
i counted the spaces
why
in case the ghost is trying to communicate
im trying morse
morse
yeah
dots and dashes used
i know what morse code is murph
i just dont think
your bookshelfs trying to talk to you
had to reset every compass clock and gps
to offset for the anomaly
which is
i dont know
if the house was built on magnetic ore
wed have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor
i hear your meeting at the school
didnt go so well
heh you heard
its like weve forgotten who we are donald
explorers pioneers not caretakers
when i was a kid
it felt like they made something new
every day some
gadget or idea
like every day was christmas
but six billion people
just try to imagine that
and every last one of them
trying to have it all
sighs
this world isnt so bad
and tom will do just fine
youre the one who doesnt belong
born 40 years too late or 40 years too early
my daughter knew it god bless her
and your kids know it especially murph
well we used to look up in the sky
and wonder
at our place in the stars
now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt
cooper you were good at something
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it
im sorry
woman 4
you didnt expect
this dirt that was giving you this food
to turn on you like that and destroy you
in april i believe im right
fifteenth of april i think
this happened about 130 when that thing
came off the top of that canyon
cheering
in my day we had real ballplayers
who are these bums
cooper
in my day people were too busy
fighting over food to even play baseball
popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural
i want a hot dog
school says youre gonna follow
in my footsteps
i think thats great
you think thats great
you hate farming dad
grandpa said
cooper
grandpa said huh
listen all that matters
is how you feel about it
i like what you do
i like our farm
youre gonna be great at it
all cheering
siren wailing in distance
lets get out of here
cooper
all right its a doozy
all right gang lets mask up
tom murph check
tom yeah
murph tom you guys shut your windows
murph
murph
the ghost
grab your pillow
youre sleeping in with tom
cooper
its not a ghost
its gravity
donald
im dropping tom then heading to town
you want to clean that up
when youve finished praying to it
its not morse murph its binary
thick is one thin is zero
coordinates
nope mmmm
here we go
thirtythree
thats it
i cant miss this
grandpa will be back in a couple hours murph
but you dont know what youre gonna find
and that
is why i cant take you
murph
grandpa will be home in a while
tell him ill call him on the radio
aah
jesus
what are you doing
hehheh
oh you think this is funny huh
you wouldnt be here if it wasnt for me
make yourself useful
softly
hey murph
murph
i think this is the end of the road
didnt you bring the bolt cutters
thats my girl
mans voice
step away
cooper dont shoot im not armed
my daughters in the car
crackling
footsteps
mans voice dont be afraid
aah
mans voice
how did you find this place
wheres my daughter
you had the coordinates for this facility
marked on your map where did you get them
wheres my daughter
dont make me take you down again
sit down
cooper
oh you still think youre a marine pal
marines dont exist anymore
and i got grunts like you mowing my grass
where did you find those coordinates
but you dont look much like a lawnmower
think ill turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner
woman
no you wont
tars back down please
you know youre taking a risk
using exmilitary security
theyre old and their control units
are unpredictable
its what the government could spare
panting
who are you
dr brand
i knew a dr brand once he was a professor
what makes you think im not
wasnt near as cute either
please dr brand
i dont have any idea what this is
now im scared for my daughter
and want her by my side
you give me that
ill tell you anything you want to know
get the principals and the girl
in the conference room please
your daughter is fine
bright kid
must have a very smart mother
its pretty clear you dont want any visitors
so why dont you just let us back up from
your fence and well be on our way huh
its not that simple
well sure it is
i dont know anything about you
i dont know anything about this place
yes you do
dad
hello cooper
professor brand
man
explain to me how you found this facility
kind of an accident we sort of stumbled
upon it we were on a salvage run
youre sitting in the bestkept secret
in the world
nobody stumbles in here
nobody stumbles out
brand
cooper please
cooperate with these people
look
its kind of hard to explain
we learned these coordinates
from an anomaly
what sort of anomaly
i hesitate to term it supernatural
but it definitely wasnt scientific
youre going to have to be specific
mr cooper right now
it was gravity
um what sort of gravitational anomaly
where was this
now im real happy that youre excited
about gravity bud
but youre not getting any answers from us
until i get assurances
assurances
cooper yeah
like that were getting out of here
and i dont mean in the trunk of some car
all laugh
dont you know who we are coop
no professor i dont
woman
you know my father professor brand
were nasa
nasa
brand nasa
the same nasa you flew for
cooper
i heard they shut you down sir
for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere
onto starving people
when they realized
that killing other people was
not a longterm solution
then they needed us back
in secret
why secret
brand because public opinion wouldnt
allow spending on space exploration
not while youre struggling
to put food on the table
blight
wheat seven years ago okra this year
now theres just corn
and were growing more than we ever have
but like the potatoes in ireland
and the wheat in the dust bowl
the corn will die
soon
cooper sighs
well find a way professor we always have
driven by the unshakable faith
the earth is ours
not just ours no
but it is our home
earths atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen
we dont even breathe nitrogen
blight does and as it thrives
our air gets less and less oxygen
the last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate
and your daughters generation
will be the last to survive on earth
woman murph is tired i was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office
yeah thank you
okay
now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world
were not meant to save the world
were meant to leave it
cooper
rangers
the last components of our one versatile ship
in orbit the endurance
our final expedition
you sent people out there
looking for a new home
the lazarus missions
oh that sounds cheerful
lazarus came back from the dead
sure but he had to die in the first place
theres not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life
and the nearest stars
over a thousand years away
that doesnt even qualify as futile
whered you send them
cooper
i cant tell you anymore unless you agree
to pilot this craft
youre the best pilot we ever had
i barely left the stratosphere
this team never left the simulator
we need a pilot and this is the mission
that you were trained for
without even knowing it
an hour ago you didnt even know i was alive
you were going anyway
we had no choice
but something sent you here
they chose you
whos they
how long would i be gone
hard to know years
ive got kids professor
get out there and save them
whos they
we started detecting gravitational anomalies
almost 50 years ago
mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere
in fact i believe
you encountered one yourself
yeah over the straights
my crash something tripped my flybywire
exactly
but of all these anomalies
the most significant is this
out near saturn
a disturbance of spacetime
is that a wormhole
it appeared 48 years ago
and it leads where
another galaxy
a wormholes not
a naturally occurring phenomenon
someone placed it there
they
mm
and whoever they are
they appear to be looking out for us
that wormhole lets us travel to other stars
it came along right as we needed it
theyve put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach
twelve in fact from our initial probes
you sent probes into that
mmhm
we sent people into it ten years ago
the lazarus missions
brand
twelve possible worlds
twelve ranger launches carrying
the bravest humans ever to live
led by the remarkable dr mann
each persons landing pod
had enough life support for two years
but they could use hibernation
to stretch that
making observations on organics
over a decade or more
their mission was to assess their world
and if it showed potential
then they could send out a signal
bed down for the long nap wait to be rescued
and what if the world didnt show promise
hence the bravery
you dont have the resources
to visit all 12
no
data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary
simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential
and one system shows promise
one thats a bit of a long shot isnt it
one system with three potential worlds
no long shot
okay
so if we find a home
then what
thats the long shot
theres a plan a and a plan b
did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber
cooper
this entire facilitys a centrifuge
some kind of vehicle a space station
brand
both plan a
how do you get it off the ground
the first gravitational anomalies
changed everything
suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real
so i started working on a theory
and we started building this station
but you havent solved it yet
thats why theres plan b
the problem is gravity how to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet
this is one way
plan b a population bomb
over 5000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos
how would you raise them
with equipment on board
we incubate the first 10
after that with surrogacy
the growth becomes exponential
within 30 years
we could have a colony of hundreds
the real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity
this takes care of that
but what about the people here you just
give up on them
my kids
thats why plan a is a lot more fun
how far have you got
almost there
youre asking me to hang everything
on an almost
im asking you to trust me
sighs
find us a new home
and by the time you return
i will have solved the problem of gravity
i give you my word
murph
go away
murph
murph
go if youre leaving just go
donald this world was never enough
for you was it coop
what because heading out there
is what i feel like i was born to do
and it excites me heh
no that does not make it wrong
it might
dont trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason
the why of the thing thats the foundation
and the foundations solid
we farmers we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say
next year
well next year aint gonna save us
nor the one after that
this worlds a treasure donald
but its been telling us to leave for a while now
mankind was born on earth
it was never meant to die here
tom will be all right
but you got to make things right with murph
i will
without making promises
you dont know you can keep
you have to talk to me murph
i need to fix this before i go
murph
then ill keep it broken so you have to stay
after you kids came along your mom said
something to me i never quite understood
she said now
were just here
to be memories for our kids
and i think that now i understand
what she meant
once youre a parent
youre the ghost of your childrens future
you said ghosts didnt exist
thats right murph
murph look at me
i cant be your ghost right now
i need to exist
they chose me
murph they chose me you saw
youre the one who led me to them
thats exactly why you cant go
i figured out the message
one word know what it is
murph
stay
it says stay dad
murph
you dont believe me
look at the books look at this
it says stay
why youre not listening it says stay
no im coming back
when
one for you one for me
when im up there in hypersleep or
traveling near the speed of light or
near a black hole
times gonna change for me
its gonna run more slowly
when we get back
were gonna compare
murph time will run differently for us
yeah
by the time i get back
we might even be the same age you and me
what imagine that
aw murph
you have no idea when youre coming back
no idea at all
murph dont dont make me leave like this
come on murph
dont make me leave like this murph
hey
i love you
forever you hear me
i love you forever and im coming back
im coming back
howd it go
fine
just fine
i love you tom
travel safe huh
yeah
you look after our place for me all right
all right
uhhuh
hey can i use your truck while youre gone
you mean your truck
ill make sure they bring it back
look after my kids donald

stage one
there is mach 1
everybody good
plenty of slaves for my robot colony
they gave him a humor setting
so hed fit in better with his unit
he thinks it relaxes us
a giant sarcastic robot
what a great idea
tars i have a cue light i can use
when im joking if you like
thatd probably help
you can use it to find your way back
to the ship after i blow you out the airlock
whats your humor setting tars
thats 100 percent
lets bring it on down to 75 please
tars
stage two separation
cooper
all feeds going manual
man
going manual
cooper
deactivate probe heater one two and three
man
check
taking control
tars this is handover to you
man adf check
cooper over
pull thrusters back
fuel cells one two three
man
one hundred percent
cooper
exmites
its hard leaving everything
my kids your father
were going to be spending
a lot of time together
we should learn to talk
and when not to
just being honest
i dont think you need to be that honest
hey tars whats your honesty parameter
tars ninety percent
ninety percent
absolute honesty isnt always
the most diplomatic nor the
safest form of communication
with emotional beings
okay
ninety percent it is dr brand
we are coming up on the endurance
twelve minutes out
okay taking control
approaching module port 500 meters
its all you doyle
nice and easy doyle nice and easy
i feel good
take us home
beeping
lock
target locked
cooper well done
okay helmets on
good job
doors not charging
never mind
cooper you should have control
control here
communication with ring module active
woman
oh wow
tars
thats initiate
cooper are we ready to spin
just a sec
hello case
hello tars
all right were all set
all right lets do it
heh
cooper
thirty percent of spin
one g
hows gravity treating you back there
well
romilly hey you okay
yeah
you all right
mm yeah i just need a minute
we have some dramamine in the hab pod
or maybe in the cryobeds ill just be a sec
hey brand
yeah
bring a lot
hehhehheh
amelia be safe
give my regards to dr mann
i will dad
it looks good for your trajectory
weve calculated two years to saturn
thats a lot of dramamine
look after my family will you please sir
well be waiting for you when you get back
a little older a little wiser
but happy to see you
brand
do not go gentle into that good night
old age should burn and rave at close of day
rage rage against the dying of the light
though wise men at their end
know dark is right
because their words had forked
no lightning they
do not go gentle into that good night
rage rage against the dying of the light
doyle you good
romilly yeah
okay thank you
here pills
so alone
we have each other dr mann had it worse
no i mean them
hm
cooper its a perfect planet
and we wont find another one like her
no its not like looking for a new condo
the human race is going to be
adrift
desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath
we need to find that rock
and our three prospects
are at the edge of what
might sustain human life
laura millers planet is first
laura started our biology program
cooper mmhm
amelia uh wolf edmunds is here
tell me about edmunds
oh uh wolfs a particle physicist
none of them had families huh
no no attachments my father insisted
they all knew the odds against
ever seeing another human being again
im hoping we can surprise
at least three of them
how about mann
dr mann
hes remarkable hes the best of us
he inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history
scientists explorers
thats what i love
you know out there we face great odds
death but
not evil
you dont think nature can be evil
no formidable frightening but
no not evil
hm
is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds
just what we take with us then
yeah
this crew represents the best of humanity
even me huh
you know what we agreed 90 percent
there you go
dont stay up
ill be there in a minute
just remember coop
you are literally wasting your breath
hey tars
lets go over that trajectory one more time
tars
eight months to mars
counterorbital slingshot around
fourteen months to saturn
nothings changed on that
just let me ask you something
dr brand and edmunds
why are you whispering they cant hear you
dr brand and edmunds they close
i wouldnt know
is that 90 percent wouldnt know
or 10 percent wouldnt know
i also have a discretion setting cooper
aah
but not a poker face slick
hey guys
uh dads about to go down for the long nap
so i wanted to give you an update
uh
the earth looks amazing from here um
you cant see any of the dust heh
um i really hope you guys are doing great
i know youll get this message
professor brands assured me hell get it to you
know that i love you
is it him
donald i dont think so murph
you must be donald
hello murph
why are you in my dads truck
he wanted me to bring it for your brother
he sent you a message
shes pretty upset with him for leaving
if you record any messages
i can get them to transmit it to cooper
murph is a bright spark
maybe i should fan the flame
shes already making fools of her teachers
so maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you
so where are they
heading for mars
the next time you hear from cooper
theyll be coming up on saturn
tom on recording
as far as school goes
the administration wants me
to repeat plant pathology which sucks
but they said i could start
advanced agriculture a year early
all right i got to go dad
hope youre safe up there
donald
um sorry coop
i asked murph to say hi
but shes as stubborn as her old man
ill try again next time
you all right rom
cooper clears throat
this gets to me cooper
this this
millimeters of aluminum thats it
and then nothing
out there for millions of miles
wont kill us in seconds
you know that some of the finest
solo yachtsmen in the world
dont know how to swim
they dont know how
and if they go overboard psst theyre done
were explorers rom
this is our boat
here
crickets chirping on recording
thunder rumbling
and rain falling on recording
cooper
this is from the uh relay probe
it was in orbit around the wormhole
this is the wormhole
and every time wed come around
we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy
oh yeah like swinging a periscope around
exactly
so we got a pretty good idea
what were gonna find on the other side huh
navigationally
amelia guys well be approaching
the wormhole in about three hours
hey coop
can we stop the spinning
why
because were close enough to see it now
all right
thanks
there thats it thats the wormhole
say it dont spray it rom
its a sphere
of course it is what you
you thought it would just be a hole
no its just that all the illustrations
ive ever seen they
romilly in the illustrations
theyre trying to show you how it works
so they say you want to go
from here to there
but its too far right
mmhm
so a wormhole bends space like this
so you can take a shortcut through
a higher dimension
okay so
to show that theyve turned
threedimensional space into two dimensions
which turns a wormhole
into two dimensions a circle
whats a circle in three dimensions
a sphere
exactly
a spherical hole
but who put it there
who do we have to thank
im not thanking anybody
until we get out of here in one piece rom
cooper
any trick to this doyle
no one knows
the others made it right
at least some of them
everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system
to our galaxy
here we go
hull creaking
and alarms beeping
the controls wont work here
were passing through the bulk
its space beyond our three dimensions
all you can do is record and observe
what is that
i think its them
distorting spacetime
romilly
dont dont
beeping stops
what was that
the first handshake
were
were here
doyle
so the lost communications came through
how
the relay on this side cached them
so years of basic data no real surprises
millers site has kept pinging thumbs up
as has dr manns um
edmunds went down three years ago
transmitter failure
maybe he was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark
but millers still looks good though right
because shes coming up fast
doyle mmhm
with one complication
the planet is much closer to gargantua
than we thought
cooper gargantua
its what were calling the black hole
millers and dr manns planets both orbit it
and millers is on the horizon
romilly as a basketball around a hoop
landing there takes us dangerously close
and a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull
look i could swing around that neutron star
to decelerate
amelia
no its not that its time
the gravity on that planet will slow our clock
compared to earths drastically
how bad
every hour we spend on that planet will be
seven years back on earth
jesus
well thats relativity folks
well we cant just drop down
there without
cooper we have a mission
yeah doyle we have a mission
and our mission plan a is
to find a planet that can habitate
the people that are living on earth now
you cant just think about your family
now you have to think bigger
i am thinking about my family
and millions of other families okay
plan a does not work if the people on earth
are dead by the time we pull it off
no it doesnt
thats why theres a plan b
okay coopers right
we need to think of time as a resource
like oxygen and food going down will cost us
all right look
dr manns data is promising
but it will take months to get there
and edmunds its even further
miller hasnt sent much but what she has
is very promising its water its organics
you dont find that every day
no you dont
and just think about the resources
including time
that would be spent
trying to get back here
romilly
yeah
how far off from millers planet
do we have to be to stay out of the time shift
just back from the cusp
all right which is here
just outside of millers planet
romilly right
okay
heres gargantua heres millers planet
instead of taking the endurance into orbit
around millers planet
which would conserve fuel
but we would lose a lot of time
what if we take a wider orbit around
gargantua parallel with millers planet
outside of this time shift to here
then we take the ranger down
we get miller we get her samples
we come back we analyze we debrief
were in were out
we lose a little fuel
but we save a whole lot of time
thatll work
thats good
theres no time for monkey business
or chitchat down there
so tars you should definitely stay here
case youre with me anyone else can stay
if were talking about a couple years
i could use the time to research gravity
observations from the wormhole
thats gold to professor brand
cooper
tars factor an orbit of gargantua
conserve fuel minimize thrusting
but make sure we stay in range of millers planet
you got it
tars i wouldnt leave you behind
dr brand
cooper you ready case
case yup
you dont say much do you
tars talks plenty for both of us
detach
romilly are you reading these forces
romilly its unbelievable
a literal heart of darkness
if we could just see
the collapsed star inside
the singularity yeah wed solve gravity
and we cant get anything from it
nothing escapes that horizon
not even light
the answers there just no way to see it
theres millers planet
goodbye ranger
case
this is fast for atmospheric entry
should we use the thrusters to slow
no
im gonna use the rangers aerodynamics
to save some fuel
case
air brake
we want to get down fast dont we
we want to get there in one piece
hang on
case brand doyle get ready
alarms beeping
case we should ease
cooper hands where i can see them
the only time i went down was
when a machine was easing at the wrong time
a little caution
can get you killed like reckless driving
cooper its too damn fast
i got this
case should i disable the feedback
no i need to feel the air
here we go
its just water
the stuff of life
case
twelve hundred meters
do we have a fix on the beacon
case got it
can you maneuver
ill need to shave some speed
im gonna spiral down on top of it
everybody hang on
case
seven hundred
on my cue case on my cue
case
five hundred meters
fire
very graceful
no
but very efficient
what are you waiting for lets go
go go go
seven years per hour here
lets make it count
panting
case
this way
about 200 meters
the gravitys punishing
been floating through space too long
case one hundred and thirty percent
earth gravity
cooper
come on come on
theres nothing here
case should be right here
if the signals coming from here then
her beacon
doyle
wreckage
wheres the rest
towards the mountains
those arent mountains
theyre waves
oh shit oh shit oh shit
cooper
that ones moving away from us
amelia
we need the recorder
brand doyle back to the ranger now
were not leaving without her data
get back here now
we do not have time
the second wave is coming
were in the middle of a swell
amelia
no i got it
get your ass back to the ranger now
grunting
brand get back here now
amelia
no cooper go cooper go i cant make it
go
case go get her
go
get up get up brand
doyle
go go go
im not gonna make it
yes you are yes you are
come on case has her
get back here doyle
come on
get to the hatch
go go go
shit
manually overriding inside hatch
cooper wait
cooper the engines are flooded
im gonna have to shut her down
amelia yelling
holy shit
hang on
yelling
case whats the problem
too waterlogged let it drain
goddamn it
i told you to leave me why didnt you
and i told you to get your ass back here
one of us was thinking about the mission
you were thinking about getting home
i was trying to do the right thing
can you tell that to doyle
cooper case how much time
fortyfive to an hour
the stuff of life huh
whats this gonna cost us brand
a lot decades
panting
groans
what happened to miller
judging by the wreckage she was
broken up by a wave soon after impact
hows the wreckage stayed together
after all these years huh
because of the time slippage
on this planets time
she just landed hours ago
she probably just died minutes ago
case the data doyle received
was just the initial status echoing endlessly
oh we are not prepared for this
you eggheads have the survival skills
of a boy scout troop
well we got this far on our brains
farther than any human in history
well not far enough
and now were stuck here till there wont be
anyone left on earth to save
im counting every minute
same as you cooper
is there any possibility
some kind of a way
we can maybe all jump in a black hole
gain back the years
dont shake your head at me
time is relative okay
it can stretch and it can squeeze but
it cant run backwards it just cant
the only thing that can move across
dimensions like time is gravity
okay
the beings that led us here
they communicate
through gravity right
yes
could they be talking to us from the future
maybe
okay if they can
they are beings of five dimensions
to them time might be
another physical dimension
to them
the past might be a canyon
that they can climb into and the future
a mountain they can climb up
but to us its not okay
look cooper i screwed up im sorry
but you knew about relativity
oh
softly
brand
sighs
my daughter was 10 years old
i couldnt teach her
einsteins theories before i left
couldnt you have told her
you were going to save the world
no
when you become a parent
one thing becomes really clear
and that is that you want to make sure
your children feel safe
and it rules out telling a 10yearold
that the world is ending
cooper
distant rumbling
how long for the engines case
a minute or two
we dont have it helmets on
brand copilot youre up
case blow the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters
were gonna spark it
roger that
locked
depressurizing
engines up
hello rom
ive waited years
how how many years
romilly by now it must be
case twentythree years
four months eight days
doyle
i thought i was prepared i knew the theory
realitys different
and miller
theres nothing here for us
why didnt you sleep
oh i had a couple of stretches
but i stopped believing you were coming back
and something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away
i learned what i could from the black hole
but i couldnt send anything to your father
weve been receiving but nothing gets out
amelia is he alive
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
romilly
weve got years of messages stored
cooper
computer
messages span 23 years
play it from the beginning
tom on recording
hey dad
checking in saying hi
um
finished second in school
miss kurlings still giving me cs though
pulled me down but seconds not bad
grandpa attended the ceremony
um oh
i met another girl dad
i uh
i really think this is the one
names lois thats her right there
murphy stole grandpas car
she crashed it shes okay though
hey dad
look at this
youre a grandpa
his names jesse
i kind of wanted to call him coop
but lois says uh maybe next time
donald says hes already earned
the great part so we just leave it at that
tom speaks indistinctly
lois
oh dear oh dear
say byebye grandpa
byebye grandpa okay
sorry its been a while
just
what with jesse and all
uh
grandpa died last week
we buried him out in the back forty
next to mom and
jesse
which is where we would have buried you
if youd ever
come back
murph was there at the funeral
we dont see her that much
but she came for that
you arent listening to this i know that
all these messages are just like
drifting out there in the darkness
lois says that uh
i have to let you go
and uh
so
i guess im letting you go
i dont know where you are dad
but i hope that youre at peace
goodbye
hey dad
hey murph
you son of a bitch
i never made one of these
when you were still responding
because i was so mad at you for leaving
and then when you went quiet it
seemed like i should live with that decision
and i have
but todays my birthday
and its a special one
because you told me
you once told me that when you came back
we might be the same age
and today im the age you were
when you left
so it would be a real good time
for you to come back
both sobbing
sniffles
i didnt mean to intrude its just that
ive never seen you in here before
ive never been in here before
brand
i talk to amelia all the time
it helps
im glad youve started
murph i havent i
i just had something i needed to get out
i know theyre still out there
i know
there are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting through
i know professor
im not sure what im more afraid of
them never coming back or
coming back to find weve failed
then lets succeed
so
back to the fourth iteration
lets run it through some new fields
with respect professor
weve tried that hundreds of times
it only has to work once murph
brand every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet
weve done well for the world here
whether or not we crack the equation
before i kick the bucket
dont be morbid professor
im not afraid of death
im an old physicist
im afraid of time
murph
time
youre afraid of time
weve been trying to solve the equation
without changing
the underlying assumption about time
and
and that means
each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof
its recursive its nonsensical
are you calling my lifes work
nonsense murph
no im saying that youve been trying to
finish it with one arm no with both arms
tied behind your back
and i dont understand why
im an old man murph
can we take this point up at another time
i want to talk to my daughter
brand on recording
stepping out into the universe
we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel
we must reach far beyond
our own lifespans
we must think not as individuals
but as a species
do not go gentle into that good night
cooper tars kept the endurance
right where we needed her
but the trip took years longer
than we anticipated
we no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects so
we have to choose
but how
theyre both promising
edmunds data is better but dr mann
is the one still transmitting so
weve no reason to suspect
edmundss data would have soured
his world has key elements
to sustain human life
as does dr manns
cooper this is my field
and
i really believe edmunds
is the better prospect
why
gargantua thats why
look at millers planet
hydrocarbons organics yes
but no life sterile
well find the same thing on manns
because of the black hole
murphys law
whatever can happen will happen
accident is the first building block
of evolution
but when youre orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen
it sucks in asteroids and comets
other events which would otherwise reach you
we need to go further afield
you once said that dr mann
was the best of us
hes remarkable
were only here because of him
and yet yet here he is
hes on the ground and hes sending
a very unambiguous message telling us
to come to his planet
granted but edmunds data
is more promising
we should vote
well if we vote
theres something you should know
brand
he has a right to know
that has nothing to do with it
what does
shes in love with wolf edmunds
romilly is that true
yes
and that makes me want to follow my heart
but maybe weve spent too long
trying to figure all this out with theory
youre a scientist brand
so listen to me
when i say that love
isnt something we invented its
observable powerful
it has to mean something
love has meaning yes
social utility social bonding child rearing
we love people who have died
wheres the social utility in that
none
maybe it means something more
something we cant
yet understand
maybe its some evidence some
artifact of a higher dimension
that we cant consciously perceive
im drawn across the universe
to someone i havent seen in a decade
who i know is probably dead
love is the one thing
were capable of perceiving
that transcends dimensions
of time and space
maybe we should trust that
even if we cant understand it yet
all right cooper
yes
the tiniest possibility
of seeing wolf again excites me
that doesnt mean im wrong
honestly amelia
it might
tars chart a course for dr manns
tom
well lose about a third again
but next year
next year im gonna work nelsons farm
and well make it up
what happened to nelson
lois
murph would you like some more soufflé
oh no im full thanks it was delicious
coop finish your fritter please
will you spend the night
your room is exactly as you left it its ready
i need to get back
lois my sewing machine is in there
but theres plenty
i need to
too many memories
we might have something for that
hey coop
coop coughing
the dust
lois i have a friend who
could look at his lungs
distant rumbling
cooper amelia im sorry
you were just being objective
unless youre punishing me
for screwing up on millers planet
no this wasnt a personal decision
if youre wrong you will have
a very personal decision to make
your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey
strike out on manns planet and well have
to decide whether to return home
or push on to edmunds with plan b
starting a colony could save us
from extinction
you might have to decide
between seeing your children again
and the future of the human race
i trust youll be as objective then
hes been asking for you since he came to
we were trying to reach you
murph
im here professor
i let you all down
no you got us so far real close
ill finish what you started
good good murph
you had faith
all those
all those years
i
i asked you to have faith
i wanted you to believe
that your father
would come back
i do professor
forgive me murph
theres nothing to forgive
i
i lied murph
i lied to you
there was no need for him to
to come back
there is no way to help us
but plan a
all this all these people
and the equation
did my father know
did he leave me
do
not
go
gentle
no
no
you cant leave
you no
murph dr brand im sorry to tell you
that your father died today he had no pain
he was at peace
im very sorry for your loss
brand did you know
he told you right
you knew
this was all a sham
you left us here
to suffocate
to starve
alarm beeping
cooper
frozen cloud
gasping
crying
softly
its okay
its okay
its okay
pray you never learn
just how good it can be
to see another face
i hadnt a lot of hope to begin with but
after so long i had none
my supplies were completely exhausted
the last time i went to sleep
i didnt even set a waking date
you have literally raised me from the dead
lazarus
hm
what about the others
im afraid youre it sir
so far surely
no our present situation is that theres
very little chance of rescuing any others
amelia
dr mann dr mann
tell us about your world
our world we hope
sniffles
our world uh is cold
stark
but undeniably beautiful
mann
the days are 67 hours long cold
the nights are
67 far colder hours
the gravity is a very very pleasant
80 percent of the earths
now up here where i landed
the water is alkali
and the air has too much ammonia to breathe
for more than just a few minutes
but down at the surface
and there is a surface
the chlorine dissipates
the ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air
to organics
possibly even to life
we might be sharing this world
these readings are from the surface
over the years ive dropped various probes
cooper how far have you explored
ive mounted several major expeditions
but with oxygen in limited supply
kipp there really did most of the legwork
tars what went wrong with him sir
mann degeneration
he misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals
we struggled on for a time
but ultimately i decommissioned him and
used his power source
to keep the mission going
i thought i was alone
before i shut him down
would you like me to look at him
no no he needs a human touch
dr brand case is relaying a message
for you from the comm station
okay be right there excuse me
dr brand im sorry to tell you
that your father died today
he had no pain
he was at peace
im sorry for your loss
amelia
is that murph
shes shes grown
brand did you know
he told you right
you knew
this was all a sham
you left us here
to suffocate
to starve
did my father know too
murph sniffles
dad
i just want to know
if you left me here to die
i just have to know
cooper my
my father dedicated
his whole life to plan a
i have no idea what shes talking about
mann
i do
he never even hoped
to get the people off the earth
no
but hes been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years
amelia your father solved his equation
before i even left
then why wouldnt he use it
the equation couldnt reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics you need more
more more what
mann
more data you need to see into a black hole
the laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity
romilly is that true
if a black hole is an oyster
then the singularitys the pearl inside
the gravitys so strong
its always hidden in darkness
behind the horizon
thats why we call it a black hole
okay but if we see beyond the horizon
we cant coop
mann there are some things
that arent meant to be known
your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction
plan b a colony
why not tell people
why keep building those stations
he knew how hard it would be
to get people to work together
to save the species instead of themselves
or their children
bullshit
mann you never wouldve come
unless you believed you would save them
evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier
we can care deeply selflessly about
those we know but that empathy
rarely extends beyond our line of sight
but the lie
that monstrous lie
unforgivable
and he knew that
he was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species
he made an incredible sacrifice
no
an incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on earth who are gonna die
because in his fucking arrogance
he declared their case hopeless
im sorry cooper
their case is hopeless
no no
we are the future
cooper what can i do
let me go home
man
youre absolutely positive
his solution was correct
hed had it for years
its worthless
its half the answer
okay how do you find the other half
out there a black hole
but stuck down here on earth
yeah
im not sure you can
man
god they just pack up and leave
what are they hoping to find
survival
damn it
murph dont
dont people have a right to know
panic wont help
we just have to keep working same as ever
but isnt that exactly what professor brand
was manipulating us to do
brand gave up on us
im still trying to solve this
so
do you have an idea
a feeling
i told you about my ghost
my dad thought i called it a ghost
because i was scared of it
but i was never scared of it
i called it a ghost because it felt
it felt like a person
it was trying to tell me something
if theres an answer here on earth
its back there
somehow in that room
so i have to find it
were running out of time
case
what about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers
cooper no they can stay
ill be sleeping anyway
hey coop
yeah
i have a suggestion for your return journey
yeah whats that
have one last crack at the black hole
im going home rom
yeah i know
this isnt going to cost you any time
theres a chance for the people on earth
talk to me
gargantuas an older spinning black hole
its what we call a gentle singularity
gentle
theyre hardly gentle
but the tidal gravity is so quick that
something crossing the horizon fast
might survive a probe say
what happens after it crosses
after the horizon is a complete mystery
so whats to say
there isnt some way that the probe
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data
if hes equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse
tars just when did this probe
become a he professor
tars is the obvious candidate
ive already told him what to look for
id need the old optical transmitter
off kipp cooper
youd do this for us
before you get all teary remember that
as a robot i have to do anything you say
your cue lights broken
im not joking
ill need tars to remove and adapt
some components from kipp
i dont want to disturb his archival functions
ill supervise
all right
dr mann we need to find three secure sites
one for brands lab two for habitat
once those modules have landed
you dont want to move them
i can take you to the probe sites
but i dont think
these conditions will hold
i think we should wait
cooper case is headed down
with the rest of the distillery equipment
id really like to secure those sites by nightfall
well these squalls do usually blow over
okay then
youll need a longrange transmitter
got it
are you charged
yeah
follow me
tars 72 hours yeah
roger that cooper
mann brand told me why you feel
you have to go back
but id be remiss
if i didnt at least mention
that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer
you better slow down turbo
safety first case remember
case
safety first cooper
cooper i have to tell you dr mann
im honored to be a part of this
but once we set up base camp and secure
those modules my works done here
im going home
speaking indistinctly
you have attachments
but even without a family
i can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful
that emotion is at the foundation
of what makes us human
its not to be taken lightly
lois coughing
how long have you had that cough
a while
coop
mom lets me play in here
i dont touch your stuff
whirring
just take this gently
you know why we couldnt just send machines
on these missions dont you
a machine doesnt improvise well
because you cant program a fear of death
our survival instinct is our single greatest
source of inspiration
take you for example
a father
with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids
what does research tell us is the last thing
youre going to see before you die
your children their faces
at the moment of death
your minds gonna push
a little bit harder to survive
for them
deep breath
uh hey i bet youre coop
why dont you have a seat here for me
its bad they cannot stay here
okay
yeah
romilly
tars whats taking so long
tars professor i am having trouble
completing the boot up
i dont understand
cooper exhales
its funny
when i left earth
i thought i was prepared to die
the truth is
i never really considered the possibility
that my planet wasnt the one
nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to
cooper
lets go
yells
all right buddy give me a big deep breath
what is this
what are you doing
im sorry i cant let you leave with that ship
were gonna need it
to complete the mission
once the others realize
what this place isnt
we cannot survive here im sorry
im sorry
mann grunting
mann yells
murph they cant stay here anymore
man you have to leave right now
let me make something abundantly clear
you have a responsibility
man oh jesus
tom coop get her stuff shes going home
dad didnt raise you to be this dumb tom
dad didnt raise me grandpa did
and hes buried out back with mom and jesse
panting
you faked all the data
mann
yeah
theres no surface
mann
no
i tried to do my duty cooper
but i knew the day that i arrived here
that this place had nothing
and i resisted the temptation for years
but i knew that
if i just pressed that button then
somebody would come and save me
you fucking coward
yes
yes
yes
yes
both grunting
listen if youre not going to go
let your family go just save your family
and we go live underground with you
pray that daddy comes to save us
dads not coming back
he never was coming back its up to me
youre gonna save everybody
because dad couldnt do it
dad didnt even try
dad just abandoned us
he left us here to die
nobodys going with you
you gonna wait for your next kid to die
softly
get out
and dont come back
murph
you can keep my stuff
both grunting
stop it
no no
dr mann theres a 5050 chance
youre gonna kill yourself
those are the best odds ive had in years
air whooshing
and cooper yelling
dont judge me cooper
you were never tested like i was
few men have been
you tried your best murph
youre feeling it arent you
cooper coughing
the survival instinct
thats what drove me its what drives all of us
and its whats gonna save us
because i want to save all of us
for you cooper
im sorry i cant watch you go through this
im sorry
i thought i could but i cant
im here im here for you
just listen to my voice cooper
im right here
youre not alone
do you see your children
its okay
theyre right there with you
did professor brand tell you
that poem before you left
do you remember
mann panting
do not go gentle into that good night
old age should burn and rave
at close of day
rage rage against the dying of the light

i could not save him
case tars is in
ill take her now
do we have a fix on the ranger
case hes pushing into orbit
if he takes control of that ship were dead
hed maroon us
he is marooning us
ill meet you guys downstairs
go wait by the car
come on give me your bag
get in the backseat get in the backseat now

docking
case
endurance rotation is 67 68 rpm
okay get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters
case its not possible
cooper no
its necessary
case
endurance is hitting stratosphere
amelia
shes got no heat shield
case you ready
ready
case
cooper this is no time for caution
case if i black out you take the stick
tars get ready to engage
the docking mechanism
case
endurance is starting to heat
twenty feet out
tars
i need three degrees starboard cooper
ten feet out
tars
cooper we are lined up
initiating spin
groaning
come on tars
come on tars
tars we are locked cooper
locked easing up
easy
easy
retro thrusters
main engines on
pushing out of orbit come on baby
killing main engines
okay were out of orbit
laughing
okay and for our next trick
case itll have to be good
were heading into gargantuas pull
cooper
oh shit
case take the stick
roger that
panting
grunting
panting
alarms wailing
case
cooper were slipping towards gargantua
shall i use main engines
no
we got to let her slide as far as we can
cooper give it to me
tars theres good news theres bad news
yeah ive heard that one tars
give it to me straight
the backup generator kicked in
so the systems stable theyre all good
good
okay the navigational hub
has been completely destroyed
we dont have enough life support
to make it back to earth
but we can scratch our way
to edmunds planet
what about fuel
not enough but i have a plan
cooper we let gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon
then a powered slingshot around
launching us towards edmunds planet
amelia manually
thats what im here for
im gonna take us just inside the critical orbit
amelia what about time slippage
neither of us has time to worry
about relativity right now dr brand
im sorry cooper
cooper once weve gathered
enough speed around gargantua
we use lander 1
and ranger 2 as rocket boosters to
push us out of the black holes gravity
the landers linkages have been destroyed
so well have to control manually
once lander 1 is spent tars will detach
tars
and get sucked into that black hole
amelia
why does tars have to detach
we have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity
tars
newtons third law
the only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere
is to leave something behind
cooper you cant ask tars
to do this for us
hes a robot so you dont have
to ask him to do anything
amelia
cooper you asshole
sorry you broke up a little bit there
tars
its what we intended dr brand
its our only chance to save people on earth
if i can find a way to transmit
the quantum data ill find in there
they might still make it
lets just hope
theres still someone there to save

this little maneuvers
gonna cost us 51 years
you dont sound so bad for pushing 120
both whoop
alarm beeping

tars
detach
amelia goodbye tars
tars goodbye dr brand
see you on the other side coop
see you there slick
alarm beeping
okay case
nice reckless flying
case learned from the master
ranger 2 prepare to detach
what
no no cooper what are you doing
newtons third law
you got to leave something behind
you told me we had enough resources
for both of us
cooper
we agreed amelia
90 percent
dont
detach
cooper
okay i am nosing down
approaching the event horizon
portside dipping down beneath it
to go through it
heading towards blackness
staticky
i have a visual of the event
its all black
tars do you read me
its all blackness
tars do you read me over
okay
screens
getting interference
losing control of the stick i got flashes
flashes of lightness and blackness
the turbulence in the gravity is increasing
ah
the computers are going down agh
alarms beeping

im losing control of the stick

sobbing
no no no
it was you
you were my ghost
static over comm
tars
cooper cooper come in cooper
tars
roger that
you survived
somewhere
in their fifth dimension
they saved us
yeah who the hell is they
and just why would they want to help us
i dont know but they constructed
this threedimensional space
inside their fivedimensional reality
to allow you to understand it
yeah that aint working
yes it is
youve seen that time is represented here
as a physical dimension
you have worked out that you can exert
a force across spacetime
gravity to send a message
affirmative
gravity
can cross the dimensions including time
apparently
do you have the quantum data
roger i have it
i am transmitting it on all wavelengths
but nothing is getting out cooper
i can do this i can do this
but such complicated data to a child
not just any child
softly
what else
oh come on dad
murph the fires out come on
tars even if you communicate it here
she wont understand its significance for years
i get that tars
but weve got to figure something out
or the people on earth are gonna die think
cooper
they didnt bring us here
to change the past
say that again
they didnt bring us here to change the past
no they didnt bring us here at all
we brought ourselves
tars give me the coordinates
for nasa in binary
in binary roger feeding data
its not a ghost
its gravity
cooper
dont you get it yet tars
i brought myself here
were here to communicate
with the threedimensional world
were the bridge
i thought they chose me
but they didnt choose me they chose her
tars for what cooper
to save the world
all of this is one little girls bedroom
every moment
its infinitely complex
they have access to infinite time and space
but theyre not bound by anything
they cant find a specific place in time
they cant communicate
thats why im here
im gonna find a way to tell murph
just like i found this moment
how cooper
love tars love
its just like brand said my connection
with murph it is quantifiable its the key
what are we here to do
find how to tell her
the watch
the watch
thats it
we code the data into the movement
of the second hand
tars translate the data into morse
and feed it to me
translating data to morse
cooper what if she never came back for it
she will she will
man
murph i can see his car
hes coming murph
okay im coming down
tars
how do you know
because i gave it to her
roger morse is dotdotdashdot

he came back
it was him all the time
i didnt know it was him
dads gonna save us
eureka
its traditional
murph laughs
eureka
panting
did it work
tars
i think it might have
how do you know
because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract
dont you get it yet tars
theyre not beings
theyre us
what ive been doing for murph
theyre doing for me
for all of us
cooper people couldnt build this
no no not yet
but one day
not you and me but people
a civilization thats evolved past
the four dimensions we know
cooper
what happens now
birds chirping
man
mr cooper
all right lets take it slow sir
nice and easy mr cooper
remember youre no spring chicken anymore
actually you are 124 years old
cheering outside
take it slow sir
you were uh extremely lucky
the rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply
glass shatters
and kids cheer
where am i
cooper station
currently orbiting saturn
cooper station
nice of you to name it after me
laughs
what
the station isnt named after you sir
its uh named after your daughter
although shes always maintained
just how important you were
is she still alive
shell be here in a couple weeks
she is far too old to be transferring
from another station
but when she heard
that youd been found
well this is uh murphy cooper
were talking about
yes it is
well have you checked out of here
in a couple days
im sure youll be excited to see
whats in store
i actually uh did a paper on you
in high school
i know all about your life back on earth
oh yeah
right
if if youll follow me
weve got a really good situation for you
so uh when i made my suggestion
to miss cooper
i was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect
woman 1 on tv it was just constant
just that steady blow of dirt
of course i didnt speak to her personally
man 1
we always set the plate upsidedown
glasses or cups
whatever it was upsidedown
well my dad was a farmer
uh like everybody else back then
there just wasnt enough food
woman 2
we wore little things little strips
of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we wouldnt breathe so much of it
well it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope
man 2 i dont care who describes it there is
no way for it to be exaggerated it was that bad
man she did confirm
just how much you loved farming
oh she did did she
yeah
come here
home sweet home
everything replaced and put back where it
interviewees continue
speaking in background
hey is this
oh yeah
the machine we found out near saturn
when we found you yes
its uh power source was shot
but we could get you another one
yes please

yeah
family
yeah they all came out to see her
shes been in cryosleep for almost two years
family exits room
you told them i like farming
both laugh
it was me murph
i was your ghost
i know
people didnt believe me
they thought that i was doing it all myself
but
i knew who it was
nobody believed me
but i knew youd come back
how
because my dad promised me
well im here now murph
im here
no
no parent should have to watch
their own child die
i have my kids here for me now
