woman wont
tars back please
know youre taking risk using exmilitary security
theyre old control units unpredictable
government could spare
panting

dr brand
knew dr brand professor

dad
hello cooper
professor brand
man explain found facility
kind accident sort stumbled upon salvage run
youre sitting bestkept secret world
nobody stumbles nobody stumbles
brand cooper please
cooperate people
look
kind hard explain
learned coordinates anomaly
sort anomaly
hesitate term supernatural definitely wasnt scientific
youre going specific mr cooper right
gravity
um sort gravitational anomaly
im real happy youre excited gravity bud
youre getting answers us get assurances
assurances cooper yeah
like getting dont mean trunk car
laugh
dont know coop
professor dont
woman know father professor brand
nasa
nasa brand nasa
nasa flew
cooper heard shut sir
refusing drop bombs stratosphere
onto starving people
realized killing people
longterm solution needed us back
secret secret
brand public opinion wouldnt allow spending space exploration
youre struggling put food table
blight
wheat seven years ago okra year
theres corn
growing ever
like potatoes ireland wheat dust bowl
corn die
soon
cooper sighs
well find way professor always
driven unshakable faith earth

home
earths atmosphere percent nitrogen
dont even breathe nitrogen
blight thrives air gets less less oxygen
last people starve first suffocate
daughters generation
last survive earth
woman murph tired wondering could take nap office
yeah thank
okay
need tell plan save world
meant save world meant leave
cooper rangers
last components one versatile ship orbit endurance
final expedition
sent people looking new home
lazarus missions
oh sounds cheerful lazarus came back dead
sure die first place
theres planet solar system could sustain life
nearest stars thousand years away
doesnt even qualify futile
whered send
cooper
cant tell anymore unless agree
pilot craft
youre best pilot ever barely left stratosphere
team never left simulator
need pilot mission trained
without even knowing
hour ago didnt even know alive going anyway
choice
something sent
chose whos
long would gone
hard know years
ive got kids professor
get save
whos
started detecting gravitational anomalies almost years ago
mostly small distortions instruments upper atmosphere
fact believe encountered one
yeah straights
crash something tripped flybywire
exactly
anomalies significant
near saturn
disturbance spacetime
wormhole appeared years ago
leads
another galaxy
wormholes naturally occurring phenomenon
someone placed
mm
whoever appear looking us
wormhole lets us travel stars
came along right needed
theyve put potentially habitable worlds right within reach
twelve fact initial probes
sent probes mmhm
sent people ten years ago
lazarus missions
brand twelve possible worlds
twelve ranger launches carrying
bravest humans ever live
led remarkable dr mann
persons landing pod enough life support two years
could use hibernation stretch
making observations organics decade
mission assess world showed potential
could send signal bed long nap wait rescued
world didnt show promise
hence bravery
dont resources visit

data transmission back wormhole rudimentary
simple binary pings annual basis give us clue worlds potential
one system shows promise
one thats bit long shot isnt
one system three potential worlds
long shot
okay
find home
thats long shot
theres plan plan b
notice anything strange launch chamber
cooper entire facilitys centrifuge
kind vehicle space station
brand plan
get ground
first gravitational anomalies changed everything
suddenly knew harnessing gravity real
started working theory started building station
havent solved yet
thats theres plan b
problem gravity get viable amount human life planet
one way
plan b population bomb
fertilized eggs weighing kilos
would raise
equipment board incubate first
surrogacy growth becomes exponential
within years could colony hundreds
real difficulty colonization genetic diversity
takes care
people
give
kids
thats plan lot fun
far got almost
youre asking hang everything
almost
im asking trust
sighs
find us new home
time return
solved problem gravity
give word
murph go away
murph
murph go youre leaving go
donald world never enough coop
heading feel like born
excites heh
make wrong
might
dont trust right thing done wrong reason
thing thats foundation
foundations solid
farmers sit every year rains fail say
next year
well next year aint gon na save us one

hm
cooper perfect planet wont find another one like
like looking new condo
human race going

desperate rock cling catches breath
need find rock
three prospects edge
might sustain human life
laura millers planet first
laura started biology program cooper mmhm
amelia uh wolf edmunds tell edmunds
oh uh wolfs particle physicist
none families huh
attachments father insisted
knew odds ever seeing another human
im hoping surprise least three
mann dr mann
hes remarkable hes best us
inspired people follow loneliest journey human history
scientists explorers
thats love know face great odds
death
evil
dont think nature evil
formidable frightening
evil hm
lion evil rips gazelle shreds
take us
yeah
crew represents best humanity
even huh
know agreed percent
go
dont stay ill minute
remember coop literally wasting breath
hey tars lets go trajectory one time
tars eight months mars
counterorbital slingshot around fourteen months saturn
nothings changed
let ask something
dr brand edmunds whispering cant hear
dr brand edmunds close
wouldnt know
percent wouldnt know percent wouldnt know
also discretion setting cooper aah
poker face slick
hey guys
uh dads go long nap
wanted give update
uh
earth looks amazing um
cant see dust heh
um really hope guys great
know youll get message professor brands assured hell get
know love
donald dont think murph
must donald
hello murph
dads truck
wanted bring brother
sent message
shes pretty upset leaving
record messages get transmit cooper
murph bright spark
maybe fan flame
shes already making fools teachers
maybe come make fool
heading mars
next time hear cooper theyll coming saturn
tom recording far school goes
administration wants repeat plant pathology sucks
said could start advanced agriculture year early
right got go dad hope youre safe
donald um sorry coop
asked murph say hi shes stubborn old man
ill try next time
right rom
cooper clears throat
gets cooper

millimeters aluminum thats nothing
millions miles wont kill us seconds
know finest
solo yachtsmen world dont know swim
dont know go overboard psst theyre done
explorers rom
boat

crickets chirping recording
thunder rumbling rain falling recording
cooper uh relay probe
orbit around wormhole
wormhole every time wed come around
would receive images side foreign galaxy
oh yeah like swinging periscope around
exactly
got pretty good idea gon na find side huh
navigationally
amelia guys well approaching wormhole three hours
hey coop
stop spinning

close enough see
right
thanks
thats thats wormhole
say dont spray rom
sphere
course thought would hole
illustrations ive ever seen
romilly illustrations theyre trying show works
say want go
far right mmhm
wormhole bends space like take shortcut
higher dimension
okay
show theyve turned threedimensional space two dimensions
turns wormhole two dimensions circle
whats circle three dimensions
sphere exactly
spherical hole
put thank
im thanking anybody get one piece rom
cooper trick doyle
one knows
others made right
least
everybody ready say goodbye solar system
galaxy
go
hull creaking alarms beeping
controls wont work passing bulk
space beyond three dimensions record observe

think
distorting spacetime
romilly dont dont
beeping stops

first handshake


doyle lost communications came
relay side cached
years basic data real surprises
millers site kept pinging thumbs dr manns um
edmunds went three years ago
transmitter failure
maybe sending thumbs right went dark
millers still looks good though right
shes coming fast doyle mmhm
one complication
planet much closer gargantua thought
cooper gargantua calling black hole
millers dr manns planets orbit
millers horizon romilly basketball around hoop
landing takes us dangerously close
black hole big huge gravitational pull
look could swing around neutron star decelerate
amelia time
gravity planet slow clock compared earths drastically
bad
every hour spend planet
seven years back earth
jesus
well thats relativity folks
well cant drop without
cooper mission
yeah doyle mission mission plan
find planet habitate people living earth
cant think family think bigger
thinking family millions families okay
plan work people earth dead time pull
doesnt
thats theres plan b
okay coopers right
need think time resource like oxygen food going cost us
right look
dr manns data promising take months get
edmunds even
miller hasnt sent much promising water organics
dont find every day dont
think resources including time
would spent trying get back
romilly yeah
far millers planet stay time shift
back cusp
right outside millers planet
romilly right okay
heres gargantua heres millers planet
instead taking endurance orbit around millers planet
would conserve fuel would lose lot time
take wider orbit around gargantua parallel millers planet
outside time shift
take ranger get miller get samples
come back analyze debrief
lose little fuel save whole lot time
thatll work thats good
theres time monkey business chitchat
tars definitely stay
case youre anyone else stay
talking couple years could use time research gravity
observations wormhole thats gold professor brand
cooper tars factor orbit gargantua
conserve fuel minimize thrusting make sure stay range millers planet
got tars wouldnt leave behind
dr brand
cooper ready case case yup
dont say much tars talks plenty us
detach
romilly reading forces romilly unbelievable
literal heart darkness
could see collapsed star inside
singularity yeah wed solve gravity
cant get anything nothing escapes horizon
even light
answers way see theres millers planet
goodbye ranger
case fast atmospheric entry
use thrusters slow
im gon na use rangers aerodynamics save fuel
case air brake
want get fast dont want get one piece
hang case brand doyle get ready
alarms beeping
case ease cooper hands see
time went machine easing wrong time
little caution get killed like reckless driving
cooper damn fast got
case disable feedback need feel air
go
water
stuff life
case twelve hundred meters
fix beacon case got
maneuver ill need shave speed
im gon na spiral top everybody hang
case seven hundred
cue case cue
case five hundred meters
fire
graceful

efficient
waiting lets go
go go go
seven years per hour lets make count
panting
case way
meters
gravitys punishing
floating space long
case one hundred thirty percent earth gravity
cooper come come
theres nothing case right
signals coming
beacon
doyle wreckage
wheres rest
towards mountains
arent mountains
theyre waves
oh shit oh shit oh shit
cooper ones moving away us
amelia need recorder
brand doyle back ranger
leaving without data
get back
time
second wave coming middle swell
amelia got
get ass back ranger
grunting
brand get back
amelia cooper go cooper go cant make
go case go get
go get get brand
doyle go go go
im gon na make yes yes
come case get back doyle
come
get hatch
go go go

one us thinking mission thinking getting home
trying right thing
tell doyle
cooper case much time fortyfive hour
stuff life huh
whats gon na cost us brand
lot decades
panting
groans
happened miller
judging wreckage
broken wave soon impact
hows wreckage stayed together years huh
time slippage
planets time landed hours ago
probably died minutes ago
case data doyle received initial status echoing endlessly
oh prepared
eggheads survival skills boy scout troop
well got far brains farther human history
well far enough
stuck till wont anyone left earth save
im counting every minute cooper
possibility
kind way maybe jump black hole
gain back years
dont shake head
time relative okay
stretch squeeze
cant run backwards cant
thing move across dimensions like time gravity
okay
beings led us communicate
gravity right yes
could talking us future
maybe okay
beings five dimensions
time might another physical dimension

past might canyon climb future
mountain climb us okay
look cooper screwed im sorry
knew relativity
oh
softly brand
sighs
daughter years old
couldnt teach einsteins theories left
couldnt told going save world

become parent one thing becomes really clear
want make sure children feel safe
rules telling yearold world ending
cooper
distant rumbling
long engines case minute two
dont helmets
brand copilot youre
case blow cabin oxygen main thrusters
gon na spark roger
locked depressurizing

hello rom
ive waited years
many years
romilly must case twentythree years
four months eight days
doyle
thought prepared knew theory
realitys different
miller
theres nothing us
didnt sleep
oh couple stretches stopped believing coming back
something seemed wrong dreaming life away
learned could black hole
couldnt send anything father
weve receiving nothing gets
amelia alive oh yeah
yeah yeah
romilly weve got years messages stored

computer messages span years
play beginning
tom recording hey dad
checking saying hi

sobbing
sniffles
didnt mean intrude ive never seen
ive never
brand talk amelia time
helps
im glad youve started murph havent
something needed get
know theyre still know
many reasons communications might getting
know professor
im sure im afraid
never coming back
coming back find weve failed
lets succeed

back fourth iteration lets run new fields
respect professor weve tried hundreds times
work murph
brand every rivet strike could bullet
weve done well world
whether crack equation kick bucket
dont morbid professor im afraid death
im old physicist
im afraid time
murph time
youre afraid time
weve trying solve equation
without changing underlying assumption time
means
iteration attempt prove proof
recursive nonsensical
calling lifes work
nonsense murph
im saying youve trying
finish one arm arms tied behind back
dont understand
im old man murph
take point another time
want talk daughter
brand recording stepping universe
must confront reality interstellar travel
must reach far beyond lifespans
must think individuals species
go gentle good night
cooper tars kept endurance right needed
trip took years longer anticipated
longer fuel visit prospects
choose

theyre promising
edmunds data better dr mann one still transmitting
weve reason suspect edmundss data would soured
world key elements sustain human life
dr manns cooper field

really believe edmunds better prospect
gargantua thats
look millers planet hydrocarbons organics yes
life sterile well find thing manns
black hole
murphys law whatever happen happen
accident first building block evolution
youre orbiting black hole enough happen
sucks asteroids comets events would otherwise reach
need go afield
said dr mann
best us
hes remarkable
yet yet
hes ground hes sending unambiguous message telling us
come planet
granted edmunds data promising
vote
well vote theres something know
brand
right know
nothing
shes love wolf edmunds
romilly true yes
makes want follow heart
maybe weve spent long trying figure theory
youre scientist brand
listen
say love isnt something invented
observable powerful
mean something
love meaning yes social utility social bonding child rearing
love people died wheres social utility
none
maybe means something something cant
yet understand
maybe evidence
artifact higher dimension cant consciously perceive
im drawn across universe someone havent seen decade
know probably dead
love one thing capable perceiving
transcends dimensions time space
maybe trust even cant understand yet
right cooper
yes
tiniest possibility seeing wolf excites
doesnt mean im wrong
honestly amelia
might
tars chart course dr manns
tom well lose third
next year
next year im gon na work nelsons farm well make
happened nelson
lois murph would like soufflé
oh im full thanks delicious
coop finish fritter please
spend night room exactly left ready
need get back
lois sewing machine theres plenty
need
many memories
might something hey coop
coop coughing
dust
lois friend
could look lungs
distant rumbling
cooper amelia im sorry objective
unless youre punishing screwing millers planet
wasnt personal decision
youre wrong personal decision make
fuel calculations based return journey
strike manns planet well decide whether return home
push edmunds plan b
starting colony could save us extinction
might decide seeing children
future human race
trust youll objective
hes asking since came
trying reach
murph
im professor
let
got us far real close
ill finish started
good good murph
faith

years

asked faith
wanted believe
father
would come back
professor
forgive murph
theres nothing forgive

lied murph
lied
need
come back
way help us
plan

equation
father know
leave


go

cant leave

murph dr brand im sorry tell father died today pain
peace
im sorry loss

pray never learn
good see another face
hadnt lot hope begin
long none
supplies completely exhausted
last time went sleep didnt even set waking date
literally raised dead
lazarus hm
others im afraid youre sir
far surely
present situation theres little chance rescuing others
amelia dr mann dr mann
tell us world
world hope
sniffles
world uh cold
stark
undeniably beautiful
mann days hours long cold
nights
far colder hours
gravity pleasant percent earths
landed water alkali
air much ammonia breathe minutes
surface surface
chlorine dissipates
ammonia gives way crystalline hydrocarbons breathable air
organics
possibly even life
might sharing world
readings surface
years ive dropped various probes
cooper far explored ive mounted several major expeditions
oxygen limited supply kipp really legwork
tars went wrong sir mann degeneration
misidentified first organics found ammonia crystals
struggled time ultimately decommissioned
used power source keep mission going
thought alone shut
would like look
needs human touch
dr brand case relaying message comm station
okay right excuse
dr brand im sorry tell father died today
pain
peace
im sorry loss
amelia murph
shes shes grown
brand know
told right
knew
sham
left us
suffocate
starve
father know
murph sniffles
dad
want know
left die
know
cooper
father dedicated
whole life plan idea shes talking
mann
never even hoped get people earth

hes trying solve gravity equation years
amelia father solved equation even left
wouldnt use
equation couldnt reconcile relativity quantum mechanics need

mann data need see black hole
laws nature prohibit naked singularity
romilly true
black hole oyster singularitys pearl inside
gravitys strong always hidden darkness
behind horizon
thats call black hole
okay see beyond horizon
cant coop
mann things arent meant known
father find another way save human race extinction
plan b colony
tell people
keep building stations knew hard would
get people work together save species instead
children
bullshit
mann never wouldve come unless believed would save
evolution yet transcend simple barrier
care deeply selflessly
know empathy rarely extends beyond line sight
lie
monstrous lie
unforgivable
knew
prepared destroy humanity order save species
made incredible sacrifice
incredible sacrifice made people earth gon na die
fucking arrogance
declared case hopeless
im sorry cooper
case hopeless

future
cooper
let go home
man youre absolutely positive
solution correct hed years
worthless half answer

theyre hardly gentle tidal gravity quick
something crossing horizon fast might survive probe say
happens crosses horizon complete mystery
whats say isnt way probe
glimpse singularity relay quantum data
hes equipped transmit every form energy pulse
tars probe become professor
tars obvious candidate
ive already told look
id need old optical transmitter kipp cooper
youd us
get teary remember robot anything say
cue lights broken
im joking
ill need tars remove adapt components kipp
dont want disturb archival functions
ill supervise

well squalls usually blow
okay
youll need longrange transmitter got
charged yeah
follow
tars hours yeah
