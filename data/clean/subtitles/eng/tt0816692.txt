of course  he didn t start that way 
 distant rumbling 
 alarm beeping 
man  over radio  
computer says you re too tight 
  nah  i got this 
  crossing the straights 
  shutting it down  cooper 
  no 
  shutting it all down 
  no  i need power up 
 cooper yells 
girl 
dad 
 panting 
sorry  murph  go back to bed 
  i thought you were the ghost 
  no 
there are no such things as ghosts  babe 
grandpa says you can get ghosts 
maybe that s because grandpa s close
to being one himself  back to bed 
were you dreaming about the crash 
get your butt back in bed  murph  heh 
woman 1 
the wheat had died 
the blight came and we had to burn it 
and we still had corn  we had acres of corn 
but  uh  mostly we had dust 
woman 2 
i guess i can t describe it  it was just constant 
just that steady blow   
   of dirt 
woman 3 
we wore  um  little strips of sheet   
   sometimes over our nose and mouth   
   so that we wouldn t breathe so much of it 
man  when we set the table 
we always set the plate   
   upside down 
glasses or cups  whatever it was   
   upside down 
shake a leg  murph  get a move on 
tom  4 00 today  you and me in the barn 
herbicide resistance 101 
  check 
  yes  sir 
not at the table  murph 
dad  can you fix this 
cooper 
what the heck did you do   
     to my lander 
  wasn t me 
let me guess  it was your ghost 
it knocked it off 
it keeps knocking books off 
tom 
no such thing as ghosts  dumb ass 
  hey 
  i looked it up  it s called a poltergeist 
dad  tell her 
well  it s not very scientific  murph 
you said science was about admitting
what we don t know 
  she s got you there 
  hey 
start looking after our stuff 
coop 
all right  murph  you want to talk science 
don t tell me you re afraid of some ghost 
no  you got to go further 
you got to record the facts  analyze 
get to the how and the why   
   then present your conclusions  deal 
  deal 
  all right 
  have a good day at school 
man  hold up 
parent teacher conferences  parent 
not grandparent 
 horn honking 
slow down  turbo 
  that s not a dust storm 
  nelson s torching his whole crop 
blight 
man 
they re saying it s the last harvest for okra 
ever 
he should ve planted corn like the rest of us 
now  be nice to that miss hanley  she s single 
what s that supposed to mean 
repopulating the earth 
start pulling your weight  young man 
why don t you start
minding your own business  old man 
all right  murph  give me second 
uh huh 
third 
 gears grinding 
  find a gear  dumb ass 
  grind it 
shut it  tom 
  what d you do  murph 
  ah  she didn t do nothing 
  blew a tire is all 
  murphy s law 
shut up 
  grab the spare  tom 
  that is the spare 
cooper 
get the patch kit 
tom  how am i supposed to patch it out here 
cooper  you got to figure it out 
i m not always gonna be here to help you 
what s going on  murph 
why did you and mom name me
after something that s bad 
we didn t 
murphy s law 
murphy s law doesn t mean
that something bad will happen 
what it means is
whatever can happen will happen 
and that sounded just fine with us 
 whirring 
whoa 
get in 
get in  let s go 
what about the flat tire 
yeah 
it s an indian air force drone 
solar cells could power an entire farm 
take the wheel  tom 
go  go  go 
keep that aimed right at it 
faster  tom  i m losing it 
right at it 
stay on it 
here we go 
whoa 
nice one  tom 
dad 
i almost got it  don t stop  don t stop 
dad 
tom 
 tires screech 
you told me to keep driving 
well  i guess that answers the old
 if i asked you to drive off a cliff  scenario 
  we lost it 
  no  we didn t 
want to give it a whirl 
this way 
go 
let s lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir 
nicely done 
tom 
how long you think it s been up there 
cooper  delhi mission control went down 
same as ours   
     ten years ago 
  heh 
so for ten years 
  why did it come down so low 
  i don t know 
maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something 
  what 
  give me a large flatblade 
maybe some kind of signal  i don t know 
what are you gonna do with it 
i m gonna give it something
socially responsible to do   
   like drive a combine 
can t we just let it go 
it wasn t hurting anybody 
this thing needs to learn
how to adapt  murph   
   like the rest of us 
cooper  how s this work 
you guys come with 
tom 
i ve got class 
this one needs to wait 
  what did you do 
  they ll tell you about it in there 
  am i gonna be mad 
  not with me 
  just please try not to 
  hey  relax 
i got this 
little late  coop 
yeah  we had a flat 
and i guess you had to stop off
at the asian fighter plane store 
no  actually  sir  that s a surveillance drone 
with outstanding solar cells  it s indian 
take a seat 
so  uh   
   we got tom s scores back 
he s going to make an excellent farmer 
yeah  he s got a knack for it 
what about college 
the university only takes a handful 
they don t have the resources to   
i still pay my taxes 
where s that money go 
there s no more armies 
well  it doesn t go to the university 
look  coop  you have to be realistic 
you re ruling my son out for college now 
  the kid s 15 
  tom s score simply isn t high enough 
what s your waistline  about what  32 
  about a 33 inseam 
  i m not sure i see what you re getting at 
it takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my son s future 
come on  you re a well educated man  coop 
  and a trained pilot 
  and an engineer 
okay  well  right now
we don t need more engineers 
we didn t run out of television screens
and planes  we ran out of food 
the world needs farmers 
good farmers  like you 
  and tom 
  uneducated farmers 
we re a caretaker generation  coop 
and things are getting better 
  maybe your grandkids will get to be engin   
  are we done here  sir 
no 
miss hanley s here to talk about murph 
hanley 
murph is a great kid  she s really bright 
but she s been having a little trouble lately 
she brought this in to show the students 
the section on the lunar landings 
yeah  it s one of my old textbooks 
she always loved the pictures 
it s an old federal textbook  we ve
replaced them with the corrected versions 
corrected 
explaining how the apollo missions were faked
to bankrupt the soviet union 
you don t believe we went to the moon 
it was a brilliant piece of propaganda 
the soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources   
   into rockets and other useless machines 
 useless machines  
if we don t want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century  then   
   we need to teach our kids about this planet 
not tales of leaving it 
one of those useless machines
they used to make was called an mri 
if we had any of those left 
the doctors would ve been able to find   
   the cyst in my wife s brain
before she died instead of afterwards 
then she d have been the one
listening to this instead of me   
   which would have been a good thing 
because she was always   
   the calmer one 
i m sorry about your wife  mr  cooper 
but murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this   
   apollo nonsense 
so we thought it best
to bring you in and see what ideas   
   you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front 
yeah  you know what 
um  there s a game tomorrow night 
she s going through a bit of a baseball phase 
her favorite team is playing 
there s gonna be candy and soda and   
i think i ll take her to that 
 whistling 
how d it go 
i got you suspended 
  what 
man  over radio   cooper 
this is cooper  go 
coop  those combines you rebuilt
went haywire 
just reset the controllers 
i did that  now you should come take a look 
man  one by one they ve been
peeling off the fields and heading over 
something s interfering with the compass 
magnetism or some such 
 thudding 
murph 
nothing special about which book 
i ve been working on it  like you said 
  i counted the spaces 
  why 
in case the ghost is trying to communicate 
i m trying morse 
morse 
yeah 
  dots and dashes  used   
  i know what morse code is  murph 
i just don t think
your bookshelf s trying to talk to you 
had to reset every compass clock and gps
to offset for the anomaly 
  which is 
  i don t know 
if the house was built on magnetic ore   
   we d have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor 
i hear your meeting at the school
didn t go so well 
heh  you heard 
it s like we ve forgotten who we are  donald 
explorers  pioneers  not caretakers 
when i was a kid   
   it felt like they made something new
every day  some   
   gadget or idea 
like every day was christmas 
but six billion people   
   just try to imagine that 
and every last one of them
trying to have it all 
 sighs 
this world isn t so bad 
and tom will do just fine 
you re the one who doesn t belong 
born 40 years too late  or 40 years too early 
my daughter knew it  god bless her 
and your kids know it  especially murph 
well  we used to look up in the sky
and wonder   
   at our place in the stars 
now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt 
cooper  you were good at something   
   and you never got a chance
to do anything with it 
i m sorry 
woman 4 
you didn t expect   
   this dirt that was giving you this food   
   to turn on you like that and destroy you 
in april    i believe i m right   
fifteenth of april  i think 
this happened about 1 30 when that thing   
   came off the top of that canyon 
 cheering 
in my day  we had real ballplayers 
who are these bums 
cooper 
in my day  people were too busy   
   fighting over food to even play baseball 
popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural 
i want a hot dog 
school says you re gonna follow
in my footsteps 
i think that s great 
  you think that s great 
  you hate farming  dad 
grandpa said 
cooper 
grandpa said  huh 
listen  all that matters
is how you feel about it 
i like what you do 
i like our farm 
you re gonna be great at it 
 all cheering 
 siren wailing in distance 
let s get out of here 
cooper 
all right  it s a doozy 
all right  gang  let s mask up 
  tom  murph  check 
tom  yeah 
murph  tom  you guys shut your windows 
murph 
murph 
the ghost 
grab your pillow 
you re sleeping in with tom 
cooper 
it s not a ghost 
it s gravity 
donald 
i m dropping tom  then heading to town 
you want to clean that up
when you ve finished praying to it 
it s not morse  murph  it s binary 
thick is one  thin is zero 
coordinates 
nope  mm mm 
here we go 
thirty three 
that s it 
i can t miss this 
grandpa will be back in a couple hours  murph 
but you don t know what you re gonna find 
and that   
   is why i can t take you 
murph 
grandpa will be home in a while 
tell him i ll call him on the radio 
  aah 
  jesus 
  what are you doing 
  heh heh 
oh  you think this is funny  huh 
you wouldn t be here if it wasn t for me 
make yourself useful 
 softly 
hey  murph 
murph 
i think this is the end of the road 
didn t you bring the bolt cutters 
that s my girl 
man s voice 
step away 
cooper  don t shoot  i m not armed 
my daughter s in the car 
 crackling 
 footsteps 
man s voice  don t be afraid 
  aah 
man s voice 
how did you find this place 
where s my daughter 
you had the coordinates for this facility
marked on your map  where did you get them 
where s my daughter 
don t make me take you down again 
sit down 
cooper 
oh  you still think you re a marine  pal 
marines don t exist anymore 
  and i got grunts like you mowing my grass 
  where did you find those coordinates 
but you don t look much like a lawnmower 
think i ll turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner 
woman 
no  you won t 
tars  back down  please 
you know  you re taking a risk
using ex military security 
they re old  and their control units
are unpredictable 
it s what the government could spare 
 panting 
who are you 
dr  brand 
i knew a dr  brand once  he was a professor 
what makes you think i m not 
wasn t near as cute  either 
please  dr  brand 
i don t have any idea what this is 
now i m scared for my daughter
and want her by my side 
you give me that 
i ll tell you anything you want to know 
get the principals and the girl
in the conference room  please 
your daughter is fine 
bright kid 
must have a very smart mother 
it s pretty clear you don t want any visitors 
so why don t you just let us back up from
your fence and we ll be on our way  huh 
  it s not that simple 
  well  sure  it is 
i don t know anything about you 
i don t know anything about this place 
yes  you do 
dad 
hello  cooper 
professor brand 
man 
explain to me how you found this facility 
kind of an accident  we sort of stumbled
upon it  we were on a salvage run   
you re sitting in the best kept secret
in the world 
nobody stumbles in here 
nobody stumbles out 
brand 
cooper  please 
cooperate with these people 
look 
it s kind of hard to explain 
we learned these coordinates
from an anomaly 
what sort of anomaly 
i hesitate to term it supernatural 
but it definitely wasn t scientific 
you re going to have to be specific 
mr  cooper  right now 
it was gravity 
um  what sort of gravitational anomaly 
where was this 
now  i m real happy that you re excited
about gravity  bud   
   but you re not getting any answers from us
until i get assurances 
  assurances 
cooper  yeah 
like  that we re getting out of here 
and i don t mean in the trunk of some car 
 all laugh 
don t you know who we are  coop 
no  professor  i don t 
woman 
you know my father  professor brand 
we re nasa 
  nasa 
brand  nasa 
the same nasa you flew for 
cooper 
i heard they shut you down  sir   
   for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere   
   onto starving people 
when they realized
that killing other people was   
   not a long term solution 
then they needed us back 
  in secret 
  why secret 
brand  because public opinion wouldn t
allow spending on space exploration 
not while you re struggling
to put food on the table 
blight 
wheat seven years ago  okra this year 
now there s just corn 
and we re growing more than we ever have 
but like the potatoes in ireland
and the wheat in the dust bowl   
   the corn will die 
soon 
 cooper sighs 
we ll find a way  professor  we always have 
driven by the unshakable faith
the earth is ours 
not just ours  no 
but it is our home 
earth s atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen 
we don t even breathe nitrogen 
blight does  and as it thrives 
our air gets less and less oxygen 
the last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate 
and your daughter s generation   
   will be the last to survive on earth 
woman  murph is tired  i was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office 
yeah  thank you 
okay   
   now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world 
we re not meant to save the world 
we re meant to leave it 
cooper 
rangers 
the last components of our one versatile ship
in orbit  the endurance 
our final expedition 
you sent people out there
looking for a new home 
the lazarus missions 
  oh  that sounds cheerful 
  lazarus came back from the dead 
sure  but he had to die in the first place 
there s not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life   
   and the nearest star s
over a thousand years away 
that doesn t even qualify as futile 
where d you send them 
cooper   
   i can t tell you anymore unless you agree   
   to pilot this craft 
  you re the best pilot we ever had 
  i barely left the stratosphere 
this team never left the simulator 
we need a pilot  and this is the mission
that you were trained for 
without even knowing it 
an hour ago  you didn t even know i was alive 
you were going anyway 
we had no choice 
but something sent you here 
  they chose you 
  who s  they  
how long would i be gone 
hard to know  years 
i ve got kids  professor 
get out there and save them 
who s  they  
we started detecting gravitational anomalies
almost 50 years ago 
mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere 
in fact  i believe
you encountered one yourself 
yeah  over the straights 
my crash  something tripped my fly by wire 
exactly 
but of all these anomalies 
the most significant is this 
out near saturn   
   a disturbance of space time 
  is that a wormhole 
  it appeared 48 years ago 
and it leads where 
another galaxy 
a wormhole s not
a naturally occurring phenomenon 
someone placed it there 
   they  
  mm 
and whoever they are 
they appear to be looking out for us 
that wormhole lets us travel to other stars 
it came along right as we needed it 
they ve put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach 
twelve  in fact  from our initial probes 
  you sent probes into that 
  mm hm 
we sent people into it  ten years ago 
the lazarus missions 
brand 
twelve possible worlds   
   twelve ranger launches carrying   
   the bravest humans ever to live   
   led by the remarkable dr  mann 
each person s landing pod
had enough life support for two years 
but they could use hibernation
to stretch that   
   making observations on organics
over a decade or more 
their mission was to assess their world 
and if it showed potential   
   then they could send out a signal 
bed down for the long nap  wait to be rescued 
and what if the world didn t show promise 
hence the bravery 
you don t have the resources
to visit all 12 
no 
data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary 
simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential 
and one system shows promise 
one  that s a bit of a long shot  isn t it 
one system with three potential worlds 
no long shot 
okay 
so if we find a home   
     then what 
  that s the long shot 
there s a plan a and a plan b 
did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber 
cooper 
this entire facility s a centrifuge 
some kind of vehicle  a space station 
brand 
both  plan a 
how do you get it off the ground 
the first gravitational anomalies
changed everything 
suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real 
so i started working on a theory
and we started building this station 
but you haven t solved it yet 
that s why there s plan b 
the problem is gravity  how to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet 
this is one way 
plan b  a population bomb 
over 5 000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos 
how would you raise them 
with equipment on board 
we incubate the first 10 
after that  with surrogacy 
the growth becomes exponential 
within 30 years 
we could have a colony of hundreds 
the real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity 
this takes care of that 
but what about the people here  you just   
   give up on them 
my kids 
that s why plan a is a lot more fun 
  how far have you got 
  almost there 
you re asking me to hang everything   
   on an almost 
i m asking you to trust me 
 sighs 
find us a new home 
and by the time you return   
   i will have solved the problem of gravity 
i give you my word 
murph 
go away 
murph 
murph 
go  if you re leaving  just go 
donald  this world was never enough
for you  was it  coop 
what  because heading out there
is what i feel like i was born to do 
and it excites me  heh 
no  that does not make it wrong 
it might 
don t trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason 
the why of the thing  that s the foundation 
and the foundation s solid 
we farmers  we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say 
 next year  
well  next year ain t gonna save us 
nor the one after that 
this world s a treasure  donald 
but it s been telling us to leave for a while now 
mankind was born on earth 
it was never meant to die here 
tom will be all right 
but you got to make things right with murph 
i will 
without making promises
you don t know you can keep 
you have to talk to me  murph 
i need to fix this before i go 
murph 
then i ll keep it broken so you have to stay 
after you kids came along  your mom said
something to me i never quite understood 
she said   now   
   we re just here
to be memories for our kids  
and i think that now i understand
what she meant 
once you re a parent 
you re the ghost of your children s future 
you said ghosts didn t exist 
that s right  murph 
murph  look at me 
i can t be your ghost right now 
i need to exist 
they chose me 
murph  they chose me  you saw 
you re the one who led me to them 
that s exactly why you can t go 
i figured out the message 
  one word  know what it is 
  murph 
 stay  
  it says   stay   dad 
  murph 
you don t believe me 
look at the books  look at this 
it says   stay  
why     you re not listening  it says   stay  
no  i m coming back 
when 
one for you  one for me 
when i m up there in hypersleep  or   
   traveling near the speed of light  or   
   near a black hole   
   time s gonna change for me 
it s gonna run more slowly 
when we get back   
   we re gonna compare 
murph  time will run differently for us 
  yeah 
by the time i get back 
we might even be the same age  you and me 
 what   imagine that 
aw  murph   
you have no idea when you re coming back 
no idea at all 
murph  don t    don t make me leave like this 
come on  murph 
don t make me leave like this  murph 
hey   
   i love you 
forever  you hear me 
i love you forever  and i m coming back 
i m coming back 
  how d it go

it looks good for your trajectory 
we ve calculated two years to saturn 
that s a lot of dramamine 
look after my family  will you  please  sir 
we ll be waiting for you when you get back 
a little older  a little wiser 
but happy to see you 
brand 
do not go gentle into that good night
old age should burn and rave at close of day
rage  rage against the dying of the light
though wise men at their end
know dark is right
because their words had forked
no lightning they
do not go gentle into that good night
rage  rage against the dying of the light
doyle  you good 
romilly  yeah 
okay  thank you 
here  pills 
so alone 
we have each other  dr  mann had it worse 
no  i mean them 
hm 
cooper  it s a perfect planet 
and we won t find another one like her 
no  it s not like looking for a new condo 
the human race is going to be   
   adrift   
   desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath 
we need to find that rock 
and our three prospects
are at the edge of what   
   might sustain human life 
laura miller s planet is first 
  laura started our biology program 
cooper  mm hm 
amelia  uh  wolf edmunds is here 
  tell me about edmunds 
oh  uh  wolf s a particle physicist 
none of them had families  huh 
no  no attachments  my father insisted 
they all knew the odds against
ever seeing another human being again 
i m hoping we can surprise
at least three of them 
  how about mann 
  dr  mann 
he s remarkable  he s the best of us 
he inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history 
scientists  explorers 
that s what i love 
you know  out there we face great odds 
death  but   
   not evil 
you don t think nature can be evil 
no  formidable  frightening  but   
     no  not evil 
  hm 
is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds 
just what we take with us  then 
yeah 
this crew represents the best of humanity 
even me  huh 
you know what  we agreed  90 percent 
there you go 
  don t stay up 
  i ll be there in a minute 
just remember  coop 
you are literally wasting your breath 
hey  tars 
let s go over that trajectory one more time 
tars 
eight months to mars 
counter orbital slingshot around 
fourteen months to saturn 
nothing s changed on that 
just let me ask you something 
  dr  brand and edmunds   
  why are you whispering  they can t hear you 
dr  brand and edmunds  they close 
i wouldn t know 
is that 90 percent  wouldn t know 
or 10 percent  wouldn t know  
  i also have a discretion setting  cooper 
  aah 
but not a poker face  slick 
hey  guys 
uh  dad s about to go down for the long nap 
so i wanted to give you an update 
uh   
the earth looks amazing from here  um   
you can t see any of the dust  heh 
um  i really hope you guys are doing great 
i know you ll get this message 
professor brand s assured me he ll get it to you 
know that i love you 
  is it him 
donald  i don t think so  murph 
you must be donald 
hello  murph 
why are you in my dad s truck 
he wanted me to bring it for your brother 
he sent you a message 
she s pretty upset with him for leaving 
if you record any messages 
i can get them to transmit it to cooper 
murph is a bright spark 
maybe i should fan the flame 
she s already making fools of her teachers 
so maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you 
  so where are they 
  heading for mars 
the next time you hear from cooper 
they ll be coming up on saturn 
tom  on recording  
as far as school goes   
   the administration wants me
to repeat plant pathology  which sucks 
but they said i could start
advanced agriculture a year early 
all right  i got to go  dad 
hope you re safe up there 
donald 
um  sorry  coop 
i asked murph to say hi 
but she s as stubborn as her old man 
i ll try again next time 
you all right  rom 
 cooper clears throat 
this gets to me  cooper 
this  this 
millimeters of aluminum  that s it 
and then nothing   
   out there for millions of miles
won t kill us in seconds 
you know that some of the finest   
   solo yachtsmen in the world
don t know how to swim 
they don t know how 
and if they go overboard  psst  they re done 
we re explorers  rom 
this is our boat 
here 
 crickets chirping on recording 
 thunder rumbling
and rain falling on recording 
cooper 
this is from the  uh  relay probe 
it was in orbit around the wormhole 
this is the wormhole 
and every time we d come around   
   we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy 
oh  yeah  like swinging a periscope around 
exactly 
so we got a pretty good idea
what we re gonna find on the other side  huh 
navigationally 
amelia  guys  we ll be approaching
the wormhole in about three hours 
hey  coop 
can we stop the spinning 
why 
because we re close enough to see it now 
all right 
thanks 
there  that s it  that s the wormhole 
say it  don t spray it  rom 
it s a sphere 
of course it is  what  you    
you thought it would just be a hole 
no  it s just that all the illustrations
i ve ever seen  they   
romilly  in the illustrations 
they re trying to show you how it works 
so they say you want to go
from here to there 
  but it s too far  right 
  mm hm 
so a wormhole bends space like this 
so you can take a shortcut through   
   a higher dimension 
okay  so   
   to show that  they ve turned
three dimensional space into two dimensions   
   which turns a wormhole
into two dimensions  a circle 
what s a circle in three dimensions 
  a sphere 
  exactly 
a spherical hole 
but who put it there 
who do we have to thank 
i m not thanking anybody
until we get out of here in one piece  rom 
cooper 
any trick to this  doyle 
no one knows 
the others made it  right 
at least some of them 
everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system 
to our galaxy 
here we go 
 hull creaking
and alarms beeping 
the controls won t work here 
we re passing through the bulk 
it s space beyond our three dimensions 
all you can do is record and observe 
what is that 
i think it s them 
distorting space time 
romilly 
don t  don t 
 beeping stops 
what was that 
the first handshake 
we re   
we re here 
doyle 
so the lost communications came through 
  how 
  the relay on this side cached them 
so years of basic data  no real surprises 
miller s site has kept pinging thumbs up 
as has dr  mann s  um   
edmunds  went down three years ago 
transmitter failure 
maybe  he was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark 
but miller s still looks good though  right 
  because she s coming up fast 
doyle  mm hm 
with one complication 
the planet is much closer to gargantua
than we thought 
cooper  gargantua 
  it s what we re calling the black hole 
miller s and dr  mann s planets both orbit it 
  and miller s is on the horizon 
romilly  as a basketball around a hoop 
landing there takes us dangerously close 
and a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull 
look  i could swing around that neutron star
to decelerate 
amelia 
no  it s not that  it s time 
the gravity on that planet will slow our clock
compared to earth s drastically 
how bad 
every hour we spend on that planet will be   
   seven years back on earth 
jesus 
well  that s relativity  folks 
well  we can t just drop down
there without   
cooper  we have a mission 
yeah  doyle  we have a mission 
and our mission plan a is   
   to find a planet that can habitate
the people that are living on earth now 
you can t just think about your family 
now you have to think bigger 
i am thinking about my family
and millions of other families  okay 
plan a does not work if the people on earth
are dead by the time we pull it off 
no  it doesn t 
that s why there s a plan b 
okay  cooper s right 
we need to think of time as a resource 
like oxygen and food  going down will cost us 
all right  look 
dr  mann s data is promising 
but it will take months to get there 
and edmunds   it s even further 
miller hasn t sent much  but what she has
is very promising  it s water  it s organics   
  you don t find that every day 
  no  you don t 
and just think about the resources 
including time   
   that would be spent
trying to get back here 
  romilly   
  yeah 
   how far off from miller s planet
do we have to be to stay out of the time shift 
just back from the cusp 
all right  which is here 
just outside of miller s planet 
romilly  right 
  okay 
here s gargantua  here s miller s planet 
instead of taking the endurance into orbit
around miller s planet   
   which would conserve fuel 
but we would lose a lot of time   
   what if we take a wider orbit around
gargantua  parallel with miller s planet   
   outside of this time shift  to here 
then we take the ranger down 
we get miller  we get her samples 
we come back  we analyze  we debrief 
we re in  we re out 
we lose a little fuel 
but we save a whole lot of time 
  that ll work 
  that s good 
there s no time for monkey business
or chit chat down there 
so  tars  you should definitely stay here 
case  you re with me  anyone else can stay 
if we re talking about a couple years 
i could use the time to research gravity 
observations from the wormhole 
that s gold to professor brand 
cooper 
tars  factor an orbit of gargantua 
conserve fuel  minimize thrusting 
but make sure we stay in range of miller s planet 
  you got it 
tars  i wouldn t leave you behind   
   dr  brand 
cooper  you ready  case 
case  yup 
  you don t say much  do you 
  tars talks plenty for both of us 
detach 
  romilly  are you reading these forces 
romilly  it s unbelievable 
a literal heart of darkness 
if we could just see
the collapsed star inside   
   the singularity  yeah  we d solve gravity 
  and we can t get anything from it 
  nothing escapes that horizon 
not even light 
  the answer s there  just no way to see it 
  there s miller s planet 
goodbye  ranger 
case 
this is fast for atmospheric entry 
  should we use the thrusters to slow 
  no 
i m gonna use the ranger s aerodynamics
to save some fuel 
case 
air brake 
  we want to get down fast  don t we 
  we want to get there in one piece 
  hang on 
case  brand  doyle  get ready 
 alarms beeping 
case  we should ease 
cooper  hands where i can see them 
the only time i went down was
when a machine was easing at the wrong time 
  a little caution   
  can get you killed  like reckless driving 
  cooper  it s too damn fast 
  i got this 
case  should i disable the feedback 
  no  i need to feel the air 
here we go 
it s just water 
the stuff of life 
case 
twelve hundred meters 
  do we have a fix on the beacon 
case  got it 
  can you maneuver 
  i ll need to shave some speed 
i m gonna spiral down on top of it 
everybody hang on 
case 
seven hundred 
on my cue  case  on my cue 
case 
five hundred meters 
fire 
very graceful 
no 
but very efficient 
what are you waiting for  let s go 
go  go  go 
seven years per hour here 
let s make it count 
 panting 
case 
this way 
about 200 meters 
the gravity s punishing 
been floating through space too long 
case  one hundred and thirty percent
earth gravity 
cooper 
come on  come on 
  there s nothing here 
case  should be right here 
if the signal s coming from here  then   
her beacon 
doyle 
wreckage 
where s the rest 
towards the mountains 
those aren t mountains 
they re waves 
oh  shit  oh  shit  oh  shit 
cooper 
that one s moving away from us 
amelia 
we need the recorder 
brand  doyle  back to the ranger now 
we re not leaving without her data 
get back here now 
we do not have time 
the second wave is coming 
we re in the middle of a swell 
amelia 
no  i got it 
get your ass back to the ranger now 
 grunting 
brand  get back here now 
amelia 
no  cooper  go  cooper  go  i can t make it 
  go 
  case  go get her 
  go 
  get up  get up  brand 
doyle 
go  go  go 
  i m not gonna make it 
  yes  you are  yes  you are 
come on  case has her 
get back here  doyle 
come on 
get to the hatch 
go  go  go 
shit 
manually overriding inside hatch 
cooper  wait 
cooper  the engines are flooded 
i m gonna have to shut her down 
 amelia yelling 
holy shit 
hang on 
 yelling 
case  what s the problem 
too waterlogged  let it drain 
goddamn it 
  i told you to leave me  why didn t you 
  and i told you to get your ass back here 
  one of us was thinking about the mission 
  you were thinking about getting home 
i was trying to do the right thing 
can you tell that to doyle 
cooper  case  how much time 
  forty five to an hour 
the stuff of life  huh 
what s this gonna cost us  brand 
a lot  decades 
 panting 
 groans 
what happened to miller 
judging by the wreckage  she was   
   broken up by a wave soon after impact 
how s the wreckage stayed together
after all these years  huh 
because of the time slippage 
on this planet s time 
she just landed hours ago 
she probably just died minutes ago 
case  the data doyle received
was just the initial status echoing endlessly 
oh  we are not prepared for this 
you eggheads have the survival skills
of a boy scout troop 
well  we got this far on our brains 
farther than any human in history 
well  not far enough 
and now we re stuck here till there won t be
anyone left on earth to save 
i m counting every minute 
same as you  cooper 
is there any possibility   
   some kind of a way
we can maybe all jump in a black hole 
gain back the years 
don t shake your head at me 
time is relative  okay 
it can stretch and it can squeeze  but   
   it can t run backwards  it just can t 
the only thing that can move across
dimensions  like time  is gravity 
okay 
the beings that led us here 
they communicate   
     through gravity  right 
  yes 
could they be talking to us from the future 
  maybe 
  okay  if they can   
 they  are beings of five dimensions 
to them  time might be
another physical dimension 
to them   
   the past might be a canyon
that they can climb into and the future   
   a mountain they can climb up 
but to us  it s not  okay 
look  cooper  i screwed up  i m sorry 
but you knew about relativity 
oh 
 softly 
brand   
 sighs 
   my daughter was 10 years old 
i couldn t teach her
einstein s theories before i left 
couldn t you have told her
you were going to save the world 
no 
when you become a parent 
one thing becomes really clear 
and that is that you want to make sure
your children feel safe 
and it rules out telling a 10 year old
that the world is ending 
cooper 
 distant rumbling 
  how long for the engines  case 
  a minute or two 
we don t have it  helmets on 
brand  co pilot  you re up 
case  blow the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters 
  we re gonna spark it 
  roger that 
  locked 
  depressurizing 
engines up 
hello  rom 
i ve waited years 
how     how many years 
romilly  by now it must be   
case  twenty three years   
   four months  eight days 
doyle 
i thought i was prepared  i knew the theory 
reality s different 
and miller 
there s nothing here for us 
why didn t you sleep 
oh  i had a couple of stretches 
but i stopped believing you were coming back 
and something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away 
i learned what i could from the black hole   
   but i couldn t send anything to your father 
we ve been receiving  but nothing gets out 
amelia  is he alive 
  oh  yeah 
  yeah 
  yeah 
romilly 
we ve got years of messages stored 
cooper 
computer 
messages span 23 years 
play it from the beginning 
tom  on recording  
hey  dad 
checking in  saying hi 
um   
finished second in school 
miss kurling s still giving me c s though 
pulled me down  but second s not bad 
grandpa attended the ceremony 
um    oh 
i met another girl  dad 
i  uh   
i really think this is the one 
name s lois  that s her right there 
murphy stole grandpa s car 
she crashed it  she s okay  though 
hey  dad 
look at this 
you re a grandpa 
his name s jesse 
i kind of wanted to call him coop 
but lois says  uh  maybe next time 
donald says he s already earned
the  great  part  so we just leave it at that 
 tom speaks indistinctly 
lois 
oh  dear  oh  dear 
say  bye bye  grandpa  
bye bye  grandpa  okay 
sorry it s been a while 
just   
   what with jesse and all 
uh   
grandpa died last week 
we buried him out in the back forty
next to mom and   
   jesse 
which is where we would have buried you
if you d ever   
   come back 
murph was there at the funeral 
we don t see her that much 
but she came for that 
you aren t listening to this  i know that 
all these messages are just  like   
   drifting out there in the darkness 
lois says that  uh   
   i have to let you go 
and  uh   
   so   
   i guess i m letting you go 
i don t know where you are  dad   
   but i hope that you re at peace 
goodbye 
hey  dad 
hey  murph 
you son of a bitch 
i never made one of these
when you were still responding   
   because i was so mad at you for leaving 
and then when you went quiet  it   
   seemed like i should live with that decision 
and i have 
but today s my birthday 
and it s a special one 
because you told me   
you once told me that when you came back 
we might be the same age 
and today i m the age you were
when you left 
so it would be a real good time
for you to come back 
 both sobbing 
 sniffles 
i didn t mean to intrude  it s just that
i ve never seen you in here before 
i ve never been in here before 
brand 
i talk to amelia all the time 
it helps 
  i m glad you ve started 
murph  i haven t  i   
i just had something i needed to get out 
  i know they re still out there 
  i know 
there are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting through 
i know  professor 
i m not sure what i m more afraid of 
them never coming back or   
   coming back to find we ve failed 
then let s succeed 
so   
   back to the fourth iteration 
let s run it through some new fields 
with respect  professor 
we ve tried that hundreds of times 
it only has to work once  murph 
brand  every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet 
we ve done well for the world here   
   whether or not we crack the equation
before i kick the bucket 
  don t be morbid  professor 
  i m not afraid of death 
i m an old physicist 
i m afraid of time 
murph 
time 
you re afraid of time 
we ve been trying to solve the equation   
   without changing
the underlying assumption about time 
  and 
  and that means   
   each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof 
it s recursive  it s nonsensical 
are you calling my life s work   
   nonsense  murph 
no  i m saying that you ve been trying to   
   finish it with one arm    no  with both arms 
   tied behind your back 
and i don t understand why 
i m an old man  murph 
can we take this point up at another time 
i want to talk to my daughter 
brand  on recording  
stepping out into the universe   
   we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel 
we must reach far beyond
our own lifespans 
we must think not as individuals
but as a species 
do not go gentle into that good night
cooper  tars kept the endurance
right where we needed her 
but the trip took years longer
than we anticipated 
we no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects  so   
   we have to choose 
but how 
they re both promising 
edmunds  data is better  but dr  mann
is the one still transmitting  so   
we ve no reason to suspect
edmunds s data would have soured 
his world has key elements
to sustain human life 
  as does dr  mann s 
  cooper  this is my field 
and   
   i really believe edmunds 
is the better prospect 
  why 
  gargantua  that s why 
look at miller s planet 
hydrocarbons  organics  yes   
   but no life  sterile 
we ll find the same thing on mann s 
because of the black hole 
murphy s law 
whatever can happen will happen 
accident is the first building block
of evolution 
but when you re orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen 
it sucks in asteroids and comets 
other events which would otherwise reach you 
we need to go further afield 
you once said that dr  mann   
   was the best of us 
he s remarkable 
we re only here because of him 
and yet    yet here he is 
he s on the ground  and he s sending
a very unambiguous message  telling us   
   to come to his planet 
granted  but edmunds  data
is more promising 
we should vote 
well  if we vote 
there s something you should know 
brand 
he has a right to know 
that has nothing to do with it 
  what does 
  she s in love with wolf edmunds 
romilly  is that true 
  yes 
and that makes me want to follow my heart 
but maybe we ve spent too long
trying to figure all this out with theory 
you re a scientist  brand 
so listen to me   
   when i say that love
isn t something we invented  it s   
   observable  powerful 
it has to mean something 
love has meaning  yes 
social utility  social bonding  child rearing   
we love people who have died 
where s the social utility in that 
none 
maybe it means something more 
something we can t   
   yet understand 
maybe it s some evidence  some   
   artifact of a higher dimension
that we can t consciously perceive 
i m drawn across the universe
to someone i haven t seen in a decade   
   who i know is probably dead 
love is the one thing
we re capable of perceiving   
   that transcends dimensions
of time and space 
maybe we should trust that 
even if we can t understand it yet 
all right  cooper   
   yes   
   the tiniest possibility
of seeing wolf again excites me 
that doesn t mean i m wrong 
honestly  amelia   
   it might 
tars  chart a course for dr  mann s 
tom 
we ll lose about a third again 
but next year   
next year i m gonna work nelson s farm
and we ll make it up 
what happened to nelson 
lois 
murph  would you like some more soufflé 
oh  no  i m full  thanks  it was delicious 
coop  finish your fritter  please 
will you spend the night 
your room is exactly as you left it  it s ready 
i need to get back 
lois  my sewing machine is in there 
but there s plenty   
i need to   
too many memories 
we might have something for that 
hey  coop 
 coop coughing 
the dust 
lois  i have a friend who   
   could look at his lungs 
 distant rumbling 
cooper  amelia  i m sorry 
  you were just being objective 
unless you re punishing me
for screwing up on miller s planet 
no  this wasn t a personal decision 
if you re wrong  you will have
a very personal decision to make 
your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey 
strike out on mann s planet  and we ll have
to decide whether to return home   
   or push on to edmunds  with plan b 
starting a colony could save us
from extinction 
you might have to decide
between seeing your children again   
   and the future of the human race 
i trust you ll be as objective then 
he s been asking for you since he came to 
we were trying to reach you 
murph 
i m here  professor 
i let you all down 
no  you got us so far  real close 
i ll finish what you started 
good  good murph 
you had faith   
   all those   
   all those years 
i   
i asked you to have faith 
i wanted you to believe   
   that your father   
   would come back 
i do  professor 
forgive me  murph 
there s nothing to forgive 
i   
i lied  murph 
i lied to you 
there was no need for him to   
to come back 
there is no way to help us 
but plan a   
all this  all these people 
and the equation 
did my father know 
did he leave me 
do   
   not   
   go   
   gentle   
no 
no 
you can t leave 
you    no 
murph  dr  brand  i m sorry to tell you
that your father died today  he had no pain 
he was at peace 
i m very sorry for your loss 
brand  did you know 
he told you  right 
you knew 
this was all a sham 
you left us here 
to suffocate 
to starve 
 alarm beeping 
cooper 
frozen cloud 
 gasping 
 crying 
 softly 
it s okay 
it s okay 
it s okay 
pray you never learn   
   just how good it can be
to see another face 
i hadn t a lot of hope to begin with  but   
   after so long  i had none 
my supplies were completely exhausted 
the last time i went to sleep 
i didn t even set a waking date 
you have literally raised me from the dead 
  lazarus 
  hm 
  what about the others 
  i m afraid you re it  sir 
so far  surely 
no  our present situation is that there s
very little chance of rescuing any others 
amelia 
dr  mann  dr  mann 
tell us about your world 
our world  we hope 
 sniffles 
our world  uh  is cold   
   stark   
   but undeniably beautiful 
mann 
the days are 67 hours long  cold 
the nights are   
   67 far colder hours 
the gravity is a very  very pleasant
80 percent of the earth s 
now  up here where i landed 
the water is alkali   
   and the air has too much ammonia to breathe
for more than just a few minutes   
   but down at the surface 
and there is a surface   
   the chlorine dissipates 
the ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air 
to organics 
possibly even to life 
we might be sharing this world 
these readings are from the surface 
over the years  i ve dropped various probes 
cooper  how far have you explored 
  i ve mounted several major expeditions 
but with oxygen in limited supply 
kipp there really did most of the legwork 
tars  what went wrong with him  sir 
mann  degeneration 
he misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals 
we struggled on for a time 
but ultimately i decommissioned him and   
   used his power source
to keep the mission going 
i thought i was alone
before i shut him down 
would you like me to look at him 
no  no  he needs a human touch 
dr  brand  case is relaying a message
for you from the comm station 
okay  be right there  excuse me 
dr  brand  i m sorry to tell you
that your father died today 
he had no pain 
he was at peace 
i m sorry for your loss 
amelia 
is that murph 
she s    she s grown 
brand  did you know 
he told you  right 
you knew 
this was all a sham 
you left us here 
to suffocate 
to starve 
did my father know too 
 murph sniffles 
dad 
i just want to know   
   if you left me here to die 
i just have to know 
cooper  my   
my father dedicated   
   his whole life to plan a 
i have no idea what she s talking about 
mann 
i do 
he never even hoped
to get the people off the earth 
no 
but he s been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years 
amelia  your father solved his equation
before i even left 
then why wouldn t he use it 
the equation couldn t reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics  you need more 
more  more what 
mann 
more data  you need to see into a black hole 
the laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity 
romilly  is that true 
if a black hole is an oyster 
then the singularity s the pearl inside 
the gravity s so strong 
it s always hidden in darkness   
   behind the horizon 
that s why we call it a black hole 
okay  but if we see beyond the horizon   
we can t  coop 
mann  there are some things
that aren t meant to be known 
your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction 
plan b  a colony 
why not tell people 
  why keep building those stations 
  he knew how hard it would be   
   to get people to work together
to save the species instead of themselves 
or their children 
bullshit 
mann  you never would ve come
unless you believed you would save them 
evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier 
we can care deeply  selflessly about   
   those we know  but that empathy
rarely extends beyond our line of sight 
but the lie 
that monstrous lie 
unforgivable 
and he knew that 
he was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species 
  he made an incredible sacrifice 
  no 
an incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on earth who are gonna die 
because in his fucking arrogance   
   he declared their case hopeless 
i m sorry  cooper   
   their case is hopeless 
no  no 
we are the future 
cooper  what can i do 
let me go home 
man 
you re absolutely positive 
his solution was correct 
he d had it for years 
  it s worthless 
  it s half the answer 
okay  how do you find the other half 
out there  a black hole 
  but stuck down here on earth 
  yeah 
i m not sure you can 
man 
god  they just pack up and leave 
what are they hoping to find 
survival 
damn it 
murph  don t    
don t people have a right to know 
panic won t help 
we just have to keep working  same as ever 
but isn t that exactly what professor brand
was manipulating us to do 
brand gave up on us 
i m still trying to solve this 
so   
   do you have an idea 
a feeling 
i told you about my ghost 
my dad thought i called it a ghost   
   because i was scared of it 
but i was never scared of it 
i called it a ghost because it felt   
it felt like a person 
it was trying to tell me something 
if there s an answer here on earth 
it s back there   
   somehow  in that room 
so i have to find it 
we re running out of time 
case 
what about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers 
cooper  no  they can stay 
i ll be sleeping anyway 
  hey  coop 
  yeah 
i have a suggestion for your return journey 
  yeah  what s that 
  have one last crack at the black hole 
i m going home  rom 
yeah  i know 
this isn t going to cost you any time 
there s a chance for the people on earth 
  talk to me 
  gargantua s an older spinning black hole 
  it s what we call a gentle singularity 
  gentle 
they re hardly gentle 
but the tidal gravity is so quick that   
   something crossing the horizon fast
might survive  a probe  say 
  what happens after it crosses 
  after the horizon is a complete mystery 
so  what s to say
there isn t some way that the probe   
   can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data 
if he s equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse 
tars  just when did this probe
become a  he   professor 
tars is the obvious candidate 
i ve already told him what to look for 
i d need the old optical transmitter
off kipp  cooper 
you d do this for us 
before you get all teary  remember that
as a robot i have to do anything you say 
your cue light s broken 
i m not joking 
i ll need tars to remove and adapt
some components from kipp 
i don t want to disturb his archival functions 
i ll supervise 
all right 
dr  mann  we need to find three secure sites 
one for brand s lab  two for habitat 
once those modules have landed 
you don t want to move them 
i can take you to the probe sites 
but i don t think   
   these conditions will hold 
i think we should wait 
cooper  case is headed down
with the rest of the distillery equipment 
i d really like to secure those sites by nightfall 
well  these squalls do usually blow over 
okay  then 
  you ll need a long range transmitter 
  got it 
  are you charged 
  yeah 
follow me 
tars  72 hours  yeah 
roger that  cooper 
mann  brand told me why you feel
you have to go back 
but i d be remiss
if i didn t at least mention   
   that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer 
you better slow down  turbo 
safety first  case  remember 
case 
safety first  cooper 
cooper  i have to tell you  dr  mann 
i m honored to be a part of this 
but once we set up base camp and secure
those modules  my work s done here 
i m going home 
 speaking indistinctly 
you have attachments 
but even without a family   
   i can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful 
that emotion is at the foundation   
   of what makes us human 
it s not to be taken lightly 
 lois coughing 
  how long have you had that cough 
  a while 
coop 
mom lets me play in here 
i don t touch your stuff 
 whirring 
just take this gently 
you know why we couldn t just send machines
on these missions  don t you 
a machine doesn t improvise well
because you can t program a fear of death 
our survival instinct is our single greatest   
   source of inspiration 
take you  for example 
a father   
   with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids 
what does research tell us is the last thing
you re going to see before you die 
your children  their faces 
at the moment of death 
your mind s gonna push   
   a little bit harder to survive 
for them 
deep breath 
uh  hey  i bet you re coop 
why don t you have a seat here for me 
it s bad  they cannot stay here 
  okay 
  yeah 
romilly 
tars  what s taking so long 
tars  professor  i am having trouble
completing the boot up 
i don t understand 
 cooper exhales 
it s funny 
when i left earth   
   i thought i was prepared to die 
the truth is   
   i never really considered the possibility
that my planet wasn t the one 
nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to 
cooper 
let s go 
 yells 
all right  buddy  give me a big deep breath 
what is this 
  what are you doing 
  i m sorry  i can t let you leave with that ship 
we re gonna need it
to complete the mission   
   once the others realize
what this place isn t 
we cannot survive here  i m sorry 
i m sorry 
 mann grunting 
 mann yells 
murph  they can t stay here anymore 
man  you have to leave right now 
let me make something abundantly clear 
you have a responsibility   
man  oh  jesus 
tom  coop  get her stuff  she s going home 
dad didn t raise you to be this dumb  tom 
dad didn t raise me  grandpa did 
and he s buried out back with mom and jesse 
 panting 
you faked all the data 
mann 
yeah 
there s no surface 
mann 
no 
i tried to do my duty  cooper   
   but i knew the day that i arrived here
that this place had nothing 
and i resisted the temptation for years   
   but i knew that   
   if i just pressed that button  then   
   somebody would come and save me 
you fucking coward 
yes 
yes 
yes 
yes 
 both grunting 
listen  if you re not going to go 
let your family go  just save your family 
and we go live underground with you 
pray that daddy comes to save us 
dad s not coming back 
he never was coming back  it s up to me 
you re gonna save everybody 
  because dad couldn t do it 
  dad didn t even try 
dad just abandoned us 
he left us here to die 
nobody s going with you 
you gonna wait for your next kid to die 
 softly 
get out 
and don t come back 
murph 
you can keep my stuff 
 both grunting 
stop it 
no  no 
dr  mann  there s a 50 50 chance
you re gonna kill yourself 
those are the best odds i ve had in years 
 air whooshing
and cooper yelling 
don t judge me  cooper 
you were never tested like i was 
few men have been 
you tried your best  murph 
you re feeling it  aren t you 
 cooper coughing 
the survival instinct 
that s what drove me  it s what drives all of us 
and it s what s gonna save us 
because i want to save all of us 
for you  cooper 
i m sorry  i can t watch you go through this 
i m sorry 
i thought i could  but i can t 
i m here  i m here for you 
just listen to my voice  cooper 
i m right here 
you re not alone 
do you see your children 
it s okay 
they re right there with you 
did professor brand tell you
that poem before you left 
do you remember

tars  there s good news  there s bad news 
yeah  i ve heard that one  tars 
give it to me straight 
the backup generator kicked in 
so the system s stable  they re all good 
good 
okay  the navigational hub
has been completely destroyed 
we don t have enough life support
to make it back to earth   
   but we can scratch our way
to edmunds  planet 
what about fuel 
not enough  but i have a plan 
cooper  we let gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon 
then a powered slingshot around 
launching us towards edmunds  planet 
amelia  manually 
  that s what i m here for 
i m gonna take us just inside the critical orbit 
amelia  what about time slippage 
  neither of us has time to worry   
   about relativity right now  dr  brand 
i m sorry  cooper 
cooper  once we ve gathered
enough speed around gargantua   
   we use lander 1   
   and ranger 2 as rocket boosters to   
   push us out of the black hole s gravity 
the lander s linkages have been destroyed   
   so we ll have to control manually 
once lander 1 is spent  tars will detach   
tars 
and get sucked into that black hole 
amelia 
why does tars have to detach 
we have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity 
tars 
newton s third law 
the only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere   
   is to leave something behind 
cooper  you can t ask tars
to do this for us 
he s a robot  so you don t have
to ask him to do anything 
amelia 
cooper  you asshole 
sorry  you broke up a little bit there 
tars 
it s what we intended  dr  brand 
it s our only chance to save people on earth 
if i can find a way to transmit
the quantum data i ll find in there   
   they might still make it

  roger that 
  you survived 
  somewhere   
   in their fifth dimension 
they saved us 
yeah  who the hell is  they  
and just why would they want to help us 
i don t know  but they constructed
this three dimensional space   
   inside their five dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it 
yeah  that ain t working 
yes  it is 
you ve seen that time is represented here
as a physical dimension 
you have worked out that you can exert
a force across space time 
gravity to send a message 
affirmative 
gravity   
   can cross the dimensions  including time 
apparently 
do you have the quantum data 
roger  i have it 
i am transmitting it on all wavelengths 
but nothing is getting out  cooper 
i can do this  i can do this 
but such complicated data to a child 
not just any child 
 softly 
what else 
oh  come on  dad 
murph  the fire s out  come on 
tars  even if you communicate it here 
she won t understand its significance for years 
i get that  tars 
but we ve got to figure something out
or the people on earth are gonna die  think 
cooper   
   they didn t bring us here
to change the past 
say that again 
they didn t bring us here to change the past 
no  they didn t bring us here at all 
we brought ourselves 
tars  give me the coordinates
for nasa in binary 
in binary  roger  feeding data 
 it s not a ghost  
 it s gravity  
cooper 
don t you get it yet  tars 
i brought myself here 
we re here to communicate
with the three dimensional world 
we re the bridge 
i thought they chose me 
  but they didn t choose me  they chose her 
tars  for what  cooper 
to save the world 
all of this is one little girl s bedroom 
every moment 
it s infinitely complex 
they have access to infinite time and space 
but they re not bound by anything 
they can t find a specific place in time 
they can t communicate 
that s why i m here 
i m gonna find a way to tell murph   
   just like i found this moment 
  how  cooper 
  love  tars  love 
it s just like brand said  my connection
with murph  it is quantifiable  it s the key 
what are we here to do 
find how to tell her 
the watch 
the watch 
that s it 
we code the data into the movement
of the second hand 
tars  translate the data into morse
and feed it to me 
translating data to morse 
cooper  what if she never came back for it 
she will  she will 
man 
murph  i can see his car 
he s coming  murph 
okay  i m coming down

how do you know

dad s gonna save us 
eureka 
it s traditional 
 murph laughs

did it work 
tars 
i think it might have 
how do you know 
because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract 
don t you get it yet  tars 
they re not  beings  
they re us 
what i ve been doing for murph 
they re doing for me 
for all of us 
cooper  people couldn t build this 
no  no  not yet 
but one day 
not you and me  but people 
a civilization that s evolved past
the four dimensions we know 
cooper 
what happens now 
 birds chirping 
man 
mr  cooper 
all right  let s take it slow  sir 
nice and easy  mr  cooper 
remember  you re no spring chicken anymore 
actually  you are 124 years old 
 cheering outside 
take it slow  sir 
you were  uh  extremely lucky 
the rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply 
 glass shatters
and kids cheer 
where am i 
cooper station 
currently orbiting saturn 
cooper station 
nice of you to name it after me 
 laughs 
what 
the station isn t named after you  sir 
it s  uh  named after your daughter 
although she s always maintained
just how important you were 
is she still alive 
she ll be here in a couple weeks 
she is far too old to be transferring
from another station   
   but when she heard
that you d been found   
   well  this is  uh  murphy cooper
we re talking about 
yes  it is 
we ll have you checked out of here
in a couple days 
i m sure you ll be excited to see
what s in store 
i actually  uh  did a paper on you
in high school 
i know all about your life back on earth 
oh  yeah 
right 
if    if you ll follow me 
we ve got a really good situation for you

uh  like everybody else back then 
there just wasn t enough food 
woman 2 
we wore little things  little strips   
   of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we wouldn t breathe so much of it

because it was hope
