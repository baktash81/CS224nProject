and you know what else
it was good
you know what im thinking tommy
im thinking of getting out

cause at least theyre honest
about being dishonest
come on why would you
wanna leave all this
hello
see im telling you this town
look chil
you and me we come out
to hollywood sniff the air
and now look at us man
we made it
and you know why
cause we knew how to hustle a deal
yeah like i got hustled
into doing the sequel
that sucks
do you know that unless
youre willing to use the r rating
you can only say the fword once
youre kiddin me
no
you know what i say
fuck that
im done
before you skate out of the business
i got a movie for you
oh yeah what
about ntl
whats ntl
whats ntl
what are you joking
no
youre pulling my chain
nothing to lose records
hello come on
its like the indie label
i sign bands i produce their albums
i sell the distribution to the majors
now you wanna make movies
yeah who doesnt
all right can you pitch it
in 25 words or less
i can do it in one word me
you
me hello me
i couldnt get your mother
to watch that movie
my life in the music business
come on gangsta rappers
the russian mafia you know
all that goddamn payola crap
this place is
like the wild wild west man
youre dodgin the bullets
youre taking the arrows
and its got a girl
there always is
her names linda moon
she plays a girl who wants to
make it big in the biz
and i am the record mogul
who makes it happen
anyway its a musical
and lindas been trying to get me
on the twoway ever since
you know she saw you
on charlie rose
where you were very smooth
and found out that i knew you
i said you would help her out
and she left you on the list
at the viper room
expecting you to show up
so tommy hows your wife
edie

who gives a shit
dont be a buzzkill
where are you goin
i gotta go to the mens
i just had two iced teas

how does the movie sound
well you dont have a movie yet
youve got a premise and a setting
but you dont have character arcs or a plot
okay but still you know
hey whos gonna play me
think about that
how about carrot top
do svidaniya
hey marla
long time no see
yeah
hows organized crime treatin ya
a little more exciting now
that youre in town
oh yeah
so mr palmer weve got reason
to believe that this was a mob hit
trust me if this were a mob hit theyd
have hired a man who knew how to shoot
he hit him in the chest
finally
after he shot up my caddy
what a shame
can you confirm that this fella was
wearing a toupee
stevie wonder could confirm
that he was wearing a toupee
so out of the blue this mr athens
just decides to look up your number
and give you a call
i know what youre gettin at marla
you think i set him up
the truth is tommy wanted me
to do a movie about him
but you cant do a movie
where the main character gets popped
in the first scene now can you
yeah its not a bad opening
you know youre right
that worked for american beauty
sunset boulevard
or casino

you see youre a movie guy
so you dont know

what do the labels want
girl groups
nicky look at me

lindas album great
im sure you can even get
a buck a record
but i got her booked
into some major gigs bro
and im two seconds away
from getting her a deal
you mean youve had linda for two years
and youve never gotten her a record deal
chili a trio is not born overnight
ive had her for three days
and i already got her a label
so it looks
like we dont need you nicky
lets get something straight
this isnt the movies
you cant tell everyone youre a wise guy
and charm their pants off
this is the music business
were all wise guys
all right wise guy ill make you a deal
carosell which is the dumbest name
ive ever heard for a company
gives me linda moons contract
and if you ever threaten her
in any way
youll regret it
for as long as you live if that
thats some deal
whats in it for me
ill just makebelieve that that dead
russian that i found in my house
had nothing to do with you
you dont know
what youre doing chil
what makes you even think
linda could make it on her own
shes got me

nick aint got the balls to stiff me
i like that idea you had
about having a bat in the car
i had my man elliot
go out and get one
a red bat
you dont send a queer to get a bat
they like these shiny queer things
what you want its not your fault
what you want is a wood bat

hold this for me please thank you
you see a bat like this
it messes up a kids swing
you gotta take too long of a swipe
