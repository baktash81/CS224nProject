  get leo 
  terrific picture  terrific 
and you know what else 
it was good 
you know what i m thinking  tommy 
i m thinking of getting out
of the movie business 
go back to my old job 
  what  being a shylock 
  yeah 
why 
 cause at least they re honest
about being dishonest 
come on  why would you
wanna leave all this 
hello 
see  i m telling you  this town 
look  chil 
you and me  we come out
to hollywood  sniff the air 
and now look at us  man 
we made it 
and you know why 
 cause we knew how to hustle a deal 
yeah  like i got hustled
into doing the sequel 
that sucks 
do you know that unless
you re willing to use the r rating 
you can only say the f word once 
  you re kiddin  me 
  no 
you know what i say 
fuck that 
i m done 
before you skate out of the business 
i got a movie for you 
oh  yeah  what 
about ntl 
what s ntl 
 what s ntl  
what  are you joking 
  no 
  you re pulling my chain 
nothing to lose records 
hello  come on 
it s  like  the indie label 
i sign bands  i produce their albums 
i sell the distribution to the majors 
  now you wanna make movies 
  yeah  who doesn t 
all right  can you pitch it
in 25 words or less 
i can do it in one word    me 
  you 
  me  hello  me 
i couldn t get your mother
to watch that movie 
my life in the music business 
come on  gangsta rappers 
the russian mafia  you know 
all that goddamn payola crap 
this place is
like the wild  wild west  man 
you re dodgin  the bullets 
you re taking the arrows 
and it s got a girl 
there always is 
her name s linda moon 
she plays a girl who wants to
make it big in the biz 
and i am the record mogul
who makes it happen 
anyway  it s a musical 
and linda s been trying to get me
on the two way ever since 
you know  she saw you
on charlie rose 
where you were very smooth 
and found out that i knew you 
i said you would help her out 
and she left you on the list
at the viper room
expecting you to show up 
so  tommy  how s your wife 
  edie 
  yeah 
who gives a shit 
don t be a buzzkill 
where are you goin  
i gotta go to the men s 
i just had two iced teas 
but how about    hey  chili 
how does the movie sound 
well  you don t have a movie yet 
you ve got a premise and a setting 
but you don t have character arcs or a plot 
okay  but still  you know 
hey  who s gonna play me 
think about that 
how about carrot top 
do svidaniya 
hey  marla 
long time no see 
yeah 
how s organized crime treatin  ya 
a little more exciting now
that you re in town 
oh  yeah 
so  mr  palmer  we ve got reason
to believe that this was a mob hit 
trust me  if this were a mob hit  they d
have hired a man who knew how to shoot 
he hit him in the chest 
finally 
after he shot up my caddy 
what a shame 
can you confirm that this fella was
wearing a toupee 
stevie wonder could confirm
that he was wearing a toupee 
so out of the blue  this mr  athens
just decides to look up your number
and give you a call 
i know what you re gettin  at  marla 
you think i set him up 
the truth is tommy wanted me
to do a movie about him 
but you can t do a movie
where the main character gets popped
in the first scene  now  can you 
yeah  it s not a bad opening 
you know  you re right 
that worked for american beauty 
sunset boulevard 
or casino 
mr  palmer 
i m glenn from thrifty executive fleet 
may i escort you to your vehicle 
but of course 
marla 
detective

would let the music
do the talking to me
to tell me what lyrics to sing 
and even when got caught up
in not having anything pre written 
which never did  would scat to it 
it s just the music 
it s the funk

nah  that guy had a black eye
and was wearing a rug

this guy s got plugs 
i hate plugs 
it looks like doll s hair 
personally  i think grafting s
the only way to go

 cause they use your own hair 
very interesting 
now are you gonna
help me out with him

so  mr  red hot chili pepper 
i heard you were at the viper room 
so raji told you about linda moon 
she s something else  huh 
the heart and soul of that group 
i m telling you  bro 
the chicks are gonna be big 
how s that 
by singing songs from the  70s 
don t laugh 
you see  you re a movie guy 
so you don t know 
but the music biz 
it goes in cycles 
it s like linda 
when i signed her 
girl power was dead 
it was the era
of the singer songwriter 
but now the market s flooded 
what do the labels want 
girl groups 
nicky  look at me 
i am 
i want linda s contract 
if you want to produce
linda s album  great 
i m sure you can even get
a buck a record 
but i got her booked
into some major gigs  bro 
and i m two seconds away
from getting her a deal 
you mean you ve had linda for two years
and you ve never gotten her a record deal 
chili  a trio is not born overnight 
i ve had her for three days 
and i already got her a label 
so it looks
like we don t need you  nicky 
let s get something straight 
this isn t the movies 
you can t tell everyone you re a wise guy
and charm their pants off 
this is the music business 
we re all wise guys 
all right  wise guy  i ll make you a deal 
carosell  which is the dumbest name
i ve ever heard for a company 
gives me linda moon s contract 
and if you ever threaten her
in any way 
you ll regret it
for as long as you live  if that 
that s some deal 
what s in it for me 
i ll just make believe that that dead
russian that i found in my house
had nothing to do with you 
you don t know
what you re doing  chil 
what makes you even think
linda could make it on her own 
she s got me 
he s gonna cry till i tell him
that i ll never roam
so  chattanooga choo choo

i like that idea you had
about having a bat in the car 
i had my man elliot
go out and get one 
a red bat 
you don t send a queer to get a bat 
they like these shiny queer things 
what you want    it s not your fault   
what you want is a wood bat 
see  like a louisville slugger 
let me see 
hold this for me  please  thank you 
you see  a bat like this 
it messes up a kid s swing 
you gotta take too long of a swipe
across the plate  you see 
he never develops those fast hands
you re gonna need for the majors 
you understand 
i don t know how fast
it s gotta be for my needs 
you know what i m sayin  to you 
i ain t gonna be up in no majors

this was the cost of doin     business 
all i want is some appreciation  elliot 
chili palmer don t realize
how hard i work for linda moon 
i tried to make her a superstar

and where s that at 
where s that always at 
on the back  at the bottom 
 produced by raji
