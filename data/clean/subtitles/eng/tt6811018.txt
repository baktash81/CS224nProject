by king uther pendragon 
but when uther died
without an heir 
the land was
torn apart by war 
many tried to claim the throne
and fought bitterly
and endlessly 
people s hearts
grew hopeless and hollow 
the country became
lost and leaderless 
so the wizard merlin
conjured a magical sword
in a stone called excalibur
and declared that only
uther s true heir
could pull it free 
many tried 
but only one succeeded 
a boy named arthur 
who had no idea he was
uther s long lost son 
arthur grew into a great king 
he turned his enemies
into allies
and ruled at a round table 
so that all were equal 
he and his knights lived
by a code of chivalry 
their hearts pure and noble 
but their greatest foe
was arthur s own
half sister  morgana 
convinced she was
the rightful heir 
and desperate
to possess excalibur 
she turned to dark sorcery 
arthur fought a fearsome
battle against her 
and bound her into
the bowels of the earth 
but not before
she swore dark vengeance 
when you are long gone 
when hearts are hollow
and the land is lost
and leaderless again 
i will return 
and so will the sword 
alex  you re gonna be late 
okay  okay 
i m coming as fast as i can 
your homework s
all over the kitchen table 
you know  every time you

and start punching them 
alex 
they were bullying bedders 
i tried to stop them 
no one said
anything about that 
why didn t you say something 
why didn t you tell someone 
alex  look at you 
because it would just
make everything worse 
how could telling the truth
make everything worse 
you wouldn t understand 
dad would understand

he s not here 
but if he was 
i know exactly what he d say 
he d say that
telling the truth
and doing the right thing
never makes anything worse

maybe it s a prank

a social experiment 
maybe there were
hidden cameras 
look 
there s something written
on the guard 
put it into google translate 
 gladius   
arturi   
filius tintageli  
it s latin 
it means   sword of arthur 
son of tinta gel  
who s tinta gel 
what are you doing 
my dad gave me
a book once  years ago   
about the knights
of the round table 
i used to know it
off by heart 
it s not  tinta gel  
it s tintagel 
and tintagel s not a person 
it s a place   
an island off the coast
of cornwall 
there s an old
ruined castle there 
some people say it s where
king arthur was born 
i went there once
when i was five 
it s where my dad lived 
the last time i ever saw him 
that s where i was
when he gave me this book 
he even signed it 
look 
 to alex  my once
and future king  dad  
alex  what if
this is a message 
what if you re the only person
who could have pulled
that sword out 
what if it s   
  go on 
  but you ll laugh at me 
i won t  i promise 
what if it s
the sword in the stone 
behold  excalibur 
kneel before your king 
yes  my lord 
you re my closest and oldest
and very best friend 
i knight thee   
sir beddersvere 
alex  is your light still on

you don t really think
that s the real
sword in the stone  do you 
of course not 
morning 
bloody hell 
oh  forgive me 
i completely forgot
to include clothing
in my vivifica
transubtantiatio 
do you by any chance
have any beetle blood 
ground animal bone 
or beaver urine 
what 
very well 
in that case 
i require your smock 
surely  officers 
it s not against the law to
take a morning constitutional 
or to wear
loose fitting garments
that permit fresh air
to circulate around
one s crevices and furrows 
now  your carriage
seems warm and dry 
take me east at once 
posthaste 
romeo charlie zero one 
what is your location 
what just happened 
pay attention 
everybody 
we have a new pupil
joining the class today 
why don t you
introduce yourself 
greetings  young academicians 
my name is   
mertin 
yes  that s right 
mertin ambrosius caledonensis 
and i am a perfectly normal
contemporary
british schoolboy 
quiet down  please 
no  bedders  absolutely not 
we cannot talk to that boy 
but he looks cool 
at the very least
i bet he s into magic 
and role playing games 
and game of thrones 
listen to me 
for the first time ever 
there s someone in this school
who s more bullyable than us 
we have to stay away from him 
as far away as possible 
some metals are common 
like copper 
and are called base metals 
others are rare and valuable 
like gold 
and are called
precious metals 
now  a long time ago 
people called  alchemists 
believed that you could
change base metals
to precious metals 
these sections of
the earth s crust
contain a wealth of history 
ruins  dead bodies 
evidence of past
civilizations 
and slowly move your
moons across  between the two 
you will start to see
how these two planets 
when their orbits intersect 
will cause the upcoming
total solar eclipse 
 upcoming  
what do you mean   upcoming  
when exactly is this
total solar eclipse due 
  four days  time 
  four days 
god s socks 
this is a catastrophe 
a disaster 
i thought it was four years 
get out of my way 
i need air  space to think 
alexander elliot 
it was you who drew the sword 
in four moons there will be
darkness in daylight 
the dual realms
will be bridged 
and morgana will return 
oh  no 
you must saddle your steeds 
gird up your armor 
gather your allies 
go away 
we don t know you 
and we don t want to know you 
leave us alone 
good people 
this realm faces
mortal danger 
and this boy among you
drew excalibur 
who will kneel at his feet
and swear allegiance 
stop it  stop that 
but rokas saw it
with his own eyes 
danielle said they tried
to catch it for two hours 
but it escaped 
he did not turn into
an owl  bedders 
but he said we re
in mortal danger 
and he knew about the sword 
how could he know
about the sword 
i don t know 
it s a coincidence 
it doesn t matter 
i ve made up my mind 
i m putting it back 
tomorrow night  after school 
it s stolen property 
and it s a weapon 
and it s making everything
go    weird 
  but what if   
  but what if what 
nothing 
good night  bedders 
mum 
mum 
mum 
the sword must be mine 
the king must die 
mertin 
what are you doing here 
saving your life  boy 
from that thing 
don t you realize 
appearing in the mortal realm
after sundown
is lethal for me 
find me here tomorrow 
without fail 
open the window  hurry 
he was a child  my lady 
a child  a child 
a boy 
no more than 12 winters 
there was another 
hardly older than
the chosen king 
he destroyed our sentinel
with an elemental
manipulation 
merlin 
a child too 
have i waited so long 
so long 
have i grown so old   
that he has grown so young 
awake  my warriors 
cease your slumber 
nightfall will be ours 
awake  my warriors 
cease your slumber 
nightfall will be ours 
awake  my warriors 
cease your slumber 
nightfall will be ours 
awake  my warriors 
cease your slumber 
nightfall will be ours 
nightfall will be ours 
nightfall will be ours 
nightfall will be ours 
come on  alex  it s time to
join the land of the living 
that is not excalibur 
tell me the truth 
where did you get that thing 
i told you 
on a building site 
then we re taking it
back there  right now 
no  you can t take it away 
and you can t keep it 
alex  it s a dangerous weapon 
and it doesn t belong to you 
yes  it does 
i pulled it out of a stone
and something came
and tried to take it back 
something old and evil
that came out of the ground 
and a boy from school came
and he saved me 
and then he turned
into an owl 
and i was wide awake
the whole time  i promise 
did you get that
out of the attic 
alex  i know you re
having a tough time 
and i know you miss your dad 
but he gave you that book
because he wanted you to
grow up to be a good person 
not the kind of person
who gets into fights 
not the kind of person
who believes in fairy tales 
and not the kind of person
who carries   
giant  medieval
weapons around 
then why did he write this 
because he loved you 
then why did he leave 
maybe i haven t told you
as much as i should about him 
he had his battles 
his demons 
but he loved you 
and this has to stop 
now  we re taking that sword
to the police station
and then i m taking
you to school 
alex 
put that down  now 
no  it s mine 
  i need it 
  i m not telling you again 
i have to go 
and i m taking it with me 
alexander elliot  don t you
dare leave this house 
alex 
sorry  mum 
alex 
alex 
i feel sick  alex 
i ve never been outside school
on a weekday
in term time before 
not without adult supervision
and a hi vis vest 
it s just  i m used to reading
about this kind of thing 
i m not used to it
actually happening 
just calm down  bedders 
let me do the talking 
ah 
finally 
take these  follow me 
come  i ve taken temporary
lodging above 
as i tried to explain
last night 
appearing in the mortal realm
after dark
drains my life force
extremely fast 
let alone contending
with a mortes milles 
it takes a very particular
potion to restore my strength 
beetle blood  ground bone
and beaver urine 
i thought i d have trouble
finding the ingredients 
but lip smackin  chicken
had it all 
really 
the red in this cherryade
derives from beetle blood 
the vanilla in this ice cream 
from beaver urine 
and these nuggets
are largely gristle
and ground animal bone 
altogether    mm   
utterly invigorating 
mm 
your name isn t mertin  is it 
it s merlin 
an ingenious alias 
don t you think 
came up with it
on the spur of the moment
in order to monitor you
incognito 
i thought merlin
was supposed to be an old man 
you look about 16 
that s because i live
backwards in time 
the older i grow 
the younger i become 
honestly  boy 
do they teach you nothing
in that so called school 
from now on 
nighttime will be dangerous
for you too  alexander 
at night the penumbra between
light and dark weakens 
the mortes milles
will rise again 
mortes milles  is that what
came to get me last night 
fallen warriors
from battles of old 
their souls enslaved by evil 
for now  they can only
enter this realm after dark 
but   
when they rise  time freezes
and every mortal
soul disappears 
save for the one
who drew the sword
and those who have
been knighted 
their spell is only
broken at sunrise 
or when every risen warrior   
is destroyed 
that s why my mum disappeared 
that s why everything went
back to normal after you left 
there are three moons
until the solar eclipse
when morgana will seize
her opportunity
to enter the realm
of the living
and retake
what she lost long ago 
excalibur 
who s morgana 
she was king arthur s
half sister 
she is greed  entitlement 
vengefulness 
and she has awoken 
but why  after all this time 
have you seen the world
outside your window 
this land is divided 
lost and leaderless 
men s hearts have
grown hollow 
that s why
her strength returns 
and that is why
the sword has returned 
and i m supposed to stop her 
that s ridiculous  i m 12 
i m not even old enough
to do a paper round 
you ll have to find
someone else 
it s too dangerous  we ll die 
so  there s your sword back 
it s been great to meet you 
and good luck with everything 
your quest has been decided 
there is no turning back 
you must find the
entrance to the underworld 
defeat morgana
in her own realm
before the moon masks the sun 
or you  your people 
and the land
on which you live 
are doomed 
you have been chosen
to save your kingdom
from slavery 
christmas day 
that was exhausting 
if i have to transform
into my adult self
every time i need to
drive a point home 
i ll be dead
before the day is done 
oh 
are there no unglazed windows
or unblocked chimneys left
in this godforsaken country 
mertin    merlin  wait 
how do we find the entrance
to the underworld 
  where do we go 
  you re a king  boy 
the path you choose
must be your own 
oh  my god  oh  my god 
oh  my god  oh  my god 
this is the worst and best
and most terrible
and brilliant and frightening
and excellent thing
that s ever happened to me 
we need to go somewhere
no one can find us 
somewhere we can think 
come on  bedders 
it s this way 
look 
the inscription 
it s just like in the book 
it s all just like
in the book 
you were right 
he knew 
it s exactly the same
in every story we ever read 
king arthur  luke skywalker 
harry potter 
none of them
know their fathers 
and then something
amazing happens 
and they find out they re
descended from powerful 
magical families 
that s me  bedders  that s me 
my mum said he had his battles
and his demons 
and now i know what she meant 
my dad s a hero 
he s the key to all of this 
we have to go to cornwall 
to tintagel 
we have to find him 
but cornwall s
hundreds of miles away 
and you haven t seen him
for years 
he ll know where the entrance
to the underworld is 
he ll know
how to defeat morgana 
he s the only one
who can help us 
look  alex 
it s already dark 
merlin said nighttime
would be dangerous 
he said the penumbra between
light and dark weakens 
he said   
the mortes milles
will rise again 
hello  boys 
nice sword  looks real 
yeah  real valuable 
playing little games  are we 
having fun
with our imaginations 
we like games  can we join in

hold on 
where did you learn
how to drive 
mario kart 
what 
  the traffic 
  stop  stop 
kaye  thanks 
you saved us 
i was gonna say
the same thing to you 
yeah  me too 
until i remembered
you tricked us into this
in the first place 
you re coming back to my house
and you re not leaving
until you explain
exactly what just happened 
now  rewind 
first  you want me
not to smash your faces in 
yes  please 
then you want us to skip
school tomorrow morning 
go to cornwall
with this freak new boy 
find your long lost dad 
kill some demon sorceress 
  and save britain from slavery 
  yes 
and out of all the people
in the entire world 
even though there s already
a royal family 
you re actually
the real  true king 
trust me 
i m as shocked as you 
well  there s one thing
i don t get 
why would people like us   
help people like you 
yeah  why would we  like 
even be seen with you 
because you re
the strongest people i know 
in the heat of battle
we had each other s backs 
we just saved
each other s lives
without even
thinking about it 
and that s exactly
what king arthur did 
he made his enemies
his allies 
he united the warring
tribes of britain
and formed a band
of loyal knights 
and together 
they defeated an enemy
bigger than all of them 
and think about it 
king arthur s
most loyal knights
were called lancelot 
kay and bedivere 
so 
so that s your names 
oh  my god  he s right 
the legend says
arthur s knights gathered
at a round table
so that they were all equal 
and look   
quick  bedders 
lift up the flaps 
see  none of this
happened by accident 
this is destiny 
this was meant to be 
so they
think themselves knights 
how deluded they are 
deluded 
the boy 
beddersvere  is meek 
meek 
nothing
without his friend 
nothing 
the boy  lance 
is greedy 
greedy 
he plans to take
the sword for himself 
take the sword 
the girl  kaye 
is clever but callow 
callow 
beholden to the boy 
and the boy himself 
he clings to myth 
trusts in lies 
i will prey
on their weaknesses 
weaknesses 
their faith
will crumble 
crumble 
their hope
will turn to hate 
hate 
their quest
will be their doom 
oi  what do you think
you re doing 
bravo  alexander 
you ve survived the night
unscathed 
emerged with two new allies 
and formulated
an excellent plan 
to journey to tintagel 
find your long lost father 
who will then help you find
the entrance to the underworld
and destroy morgana 
you think it s
an excellent plan  really 
of course it is 
tintagel island
is king arthur s birthplace 
it is strong in magic 
the mortes milles
cannot touch you there 
sir lance  lady kaye 
a pleasure to make
your acquaintance 
do us a favor  mertin 
don t talk to us  we re only
here for the fights 
that s hardly the attitude
of a knight  young man 
where s your respect
for the chivalric code 
don t tell me you ve never
heard of the chivalric code 
driver 
stop this coach at once 
the code is the cornerstone
of a civilized society 
the very credo upon which
this nation was built 
if you don t know the code 
then this entire enterprise
is utterly hopeless 
what the hell
is he on about 
excuse me  but why are we
getting off the coach 
shortcut 
follow me  quickly 
no slacking 
halt 
now  pay close attention 
the chivalric code
is the set of rules
by which
all noble knights live 
obeying the code from
the moment the sword is drawn
is what makes you
pure of heart 
and only a knight of
pure heart can slay morgana 
you must commit
the following to memory 
rule one 
honor those you love 
easy 
yeah  because
you love yourself 
rule two 
refrain from wanton offense 
what s  wanton  
  it s chinese food  i think 
  it is not chinese food 
 wanton  means deliberate
or unprovoked 
it means don t be rude or
swear or be nasty to people 
all right  don t look at me 
rule three 
speak the truth at all times 
easy  again 
that s a lie 
and finally  rule four 
persevere in any enterprise
until the end 
break any of these rules
from the moment
the sword was drawn 
and your quest is lost
before it has even begun 
i trust that is not a problem 
oi  mini merlin 
what are you doing 
we re not walking to cornwall 
indeed  we are not 
and for centuries 
historians have puzzled over
the purpose of stonehenge 
was it a temple 
a burial ground 
some sort of
astrological clock 
no  it is not 
you ignorant buffoon 
stonehenge is
a transport hub 
and just because the romans
knocked half of it down 
does not mean it s broken 
uh  excuse me 
the general public s
not permitted
to approach the stones without
the correct authorization 
hey  wait 
security  security 
come on 
you see  they re all linked 
all the paleolithic standing
stones in the country 
built as a magical
conveyance system 
designed by yours truly 
we are now on bodmin moor 
140 miles from stonehenge
and a mere  invigorating
20 mile walk due west
to tintagel island 
ah   
  what did he just say 
  did he say a 20 mile walk 
the most worthwhile path 
my young friends 
is seldom the easiest 
  come on  bedders 
  i m coming 
  come on  lance 
  i hate this already 
this is further than
i ve ever walked in my life 
if i could get a signal 
i d be in an uber  right now 
perfect 
  let us stop here awhile 
  oh  thank god 
not to rest 
  to train 
  what 
alexander  hand me the sword 
to learn the basics
of swordcraft 
you will need a weapon  each 
a simple duplication spell
for metallic objects
should suffice 
what are you doing  boy 
i do magic tricks for a hobby 
but i m no good
at duplication illusions 
so  i m gonna video what
you do and try and copy it 
i ll be most impressed
if you succeed 
wow 
now  you have
an army to fight 
a demon to slay 
a country to save 
so  let us begin 
your weapons are heavy
and cumbersome 
but you are light and agile 
use this to your advantage 
a grown warrior cannot block
their whole body
with their blade 
nor can they use its weight
to hasten their speed 
use your wits 
be brave and resolute 
and    good luck 
good luck with what 
what s he doing 
i ll fetch some food 
a reward for once you ve
vanquished your foes 
i m not
vanquishing anything 
that s it for me 
i m off 
oi  get off me 
hey 
block the branches 
  they re teaching us 
  i know 
come on then 
you want it 
try some of this 
ah 
look what it s doing 
gotcha 
their quest
will be their doom 
the sword must be mine 
must be mine 
help  something s got me 
bedders  watch out 
meek 
lance  kaye  help 
help  quickly 
it s gonna get the sword 
i m suffocating  help 
  help 
  hold them off 
help  help us 
lance  help 
take the sword and push 
help me 
if you re
the once and future king 
you can help yourself 
no  lance  no 
lance 
lance

they ll kill you 
they ll kill us all 
  lance  help  help 
  no 
come on  then 
come and get it 
let s see what you ve got 
you stupid twigs 
help me 
i can t breathe  help

merlin  look

merlin 
merlin

she s even stronger
than i feared 
we need beetle blood 
ground animal bone 
something to revive him 
it s no use  i m finished 
until sunrise  you are alone 
merlin  don t go 
merlin 
if you d helped me 
we could ve fought them off 
you nearly got us all killed 
give me the sword 
no chance 
like i told you   
i m the king around here 
kaye  please 
what are we
gonna do  alex 
merlin s not coming
back till sunrise 
the mortes milles
will come for us at sunset 
and we haven t even
  got the sword 
  bedders 
please  i m trying to think 
stop talking 
no 
you always tell me
to stop talking 
and what i m saying
is always right 
and this time   
this time i m gonna do
something about it 
bedders  wait 
the water s
getting deeper 
i don t care 
give him back the sword 
it s not yours  alex drew it 
it chose him  it s his 
here we go again 
that ll teach him 
leave him alone 
i said  leave him alone 
why should we 
because you always
ruin everything 
because you re a liar
and a cheat and a bully 
you re a bad person 
i wish i d never
asked you to join in 
all you ever cared about
is yourself 
yeah  so what if i do 
i know why
you re a bully
and a cheat and a liar 
i know why both of you are 
it s because you re scared 
you re scared
you re a nothing  a nobody 
you re scared you re not gonna
get anywhere or be anyone 
you think all that matters
is how strong you are
and how much money you ve got 
why don t you
shut up and fight 
but it shouldn t be like that 
that s why the sword came 
that s what we re
trying to change 
yeah  well  who made you
better than everyone else 
who made you king 
lance  no 
you broke it 
you broke excalibur 
you broke everything 
that s right 
walk away 
look after yourself 
just like you always do 
maybe you re right 
maybe he is a liar
and a cheat and a bully 
maybe he is scared
and selfish 
maybe we both are 
but why wouldn t we be 
that is how the world works 
nothing you or anyone does
is ever gonna change that 
i m sorry we picked on you 
i m sorry he broke the sword 
but we re not knights 
we never were 
and we never will be 
you re better off without us 
no  you re wrong 
we can t do this without you 
you re sir lancelot
and lady kaye 
we need you 
it s too late 
no  it s not 
give me my book 
the book always knows
what to do 
the lady of the lake 
excalibur s guardian 
she s in every body of water 
so maybe she s in this one 
if i m the once
and future king   
if lance and kaye and bedders
are my loyal and brave
and worthy knights 
and if this is our destiny   
then  lady of the lake   
return excalibur 
i thought something
magic was gonna happen 
oh  well 
it was worth a try 
hey 
  hey 
  alex 
bedders 
wow 
i think that s yours 
and this is yours 
we re dry 
from now on 
we stick together 
as equals 
no dishonor  no lying 
no wanton offense 
and no giving up 
swear it 
i swear 
i swear 
i thought we weren t
supposed to swear 
lance 
hey 
are you kids okay 
thank you  thank you  god 
you look like
you ve been through the wars 
what was it  then 
activity day  school trip 
did you get separated
or something 
listen   
this is gonna sound
really weird 
but if all four of us
and these ponies disappear 
don t worry 
i promise we ll
get them back to you 
i beg your pardon 
whoa 
they just vanished 
alex  the sword 
guys  i think we re gonna
have to learn how to ride 
these ponies
are way too small 
they re for little girls 
those dead things
were double the size 
do it like
show jumpers on tv 
left rein to go left 
right rein to go right 
bounce up and down
in the saddle 
they re coming  i can feel it 
meek 
they re here 
they re right
behind us 
go  go  gallop 
i don t know what
i m doing 
i can t do this 
i m gonna fall off 
greedy  greedy 
callow 
this way  into the forest 
the trees will slow them down 
come on 
my little pony  go faster 
they re catching up 
his quest will be his doom 
i got one 
he got one 
bedders has fallen off 
go get him 
we ll distract them 
they ll follow the sword 
bedders  i m coming for you 
meek

come on  bedders 
go  go 
bedders  you made it 
oh  no 
jump 
i did it  i did it 
ride 
as fast as you can 
i ve got an idea 
get off  follow me 
  what s he doing 
  alex 
let s go 
there it is 
tintagel island 
you know   
we really should
huddle together for warmth 
no way  i m not huddling
with anyone 
i don t huddle 
good luck  alex 
stay  stay 
hello 
i wonder if you can help me 
my name s alexander elliot 
i m looking for my father 
you don t remember me 
do you 
i m sophie 
i m your aunt 
i m your dad s sister 
sorry if i m staring 
but you look just like him 
i have to talk to him 
it s important 
more important than anything
in the world 
you came all the way here
from london by yourself 
does your mum even know
you re here 
all right 
then we have to call her 
no  this is nothing
to do with her 
please don t 
this is something
i have to do on my own 
well  what did your mum
tell you about him 
she said they were too young
when they had me 
he had other things
going on in his life 
she said he was
battling demons 
i didn t know what
she meant   
but i do now 
you do 
it s okay  you don t
have to lie to me 
i know who he really was 
then why would you
want to find him 
what do you mean 
he drank 
he was angry at everything
and everyone 
he wasn t a good man  alex 
he lived here
for a while  years back 
that s when your mum
brought you to see him 
she thought he might ve
changed  but he hadn t 
i don t even know
where he is anymore 
like you said 
he had his demons 
but i meant real demons 
magical demons 
like king arthur fought 
like in the book he gave me 
you don t understand 
i m the once and future king 
and he knew 
he wrote me this message
and he s waiting for me 
but  alex   
your mum bought you this book 
this is her writing 
  i want it 
  mine 
  i wanna be king 
  i wanna be queen 
i wanna be a king 
alex  what happened 
  did you find him 
  what did he say 
my dad s not here 
and he s not a hero 
he didn t care about me 
and he didn t want to know me 
he didn t even
give me the book 
my mum lied to me 
it s all a lie 
i hate her 
hey  alex 
i have to show you something 
hold out your hand 
now squeeze
as hard as you can 
and open your hand 
i did it  i couldn t sleep 
so i practiced and practiced 
and now i can do it 
i can do real magic 
you can t give up 
it s not allowed 
we re han and chewie 
frodo and samwise 
we can t give up because   
look how far we ve come 
he s right 
you ve survived three nights
against the mortes milles 
hundreds of them 
all leathery and on fire 
with their faces half
falling off and everything 
you got us here 
you turned us from enemies
into allies 
just like king arthur did 
just like in the legend 
you drew excalibur  alex 
nothing else matters 
this book
you covet  alexander   
not bad 
pretty illustrations  but   
   not entirely accurate 
remember  legends
are mere rumors
whispered down the centuries 
written and rewritten 
told and retold 
sometimes by
the rich and powerful
so they can hold on to power 
the sword doesn t care
who your parents are 
it doesn t choose
by birth or blood  alexander 
but by heart and mind 
if your legends say different 
then perhaps   
you must write them anew 
but we re right back
where we started 
we don t know where the
entrance to the underworld is
and there s only one more
night until the eclipse 
you re a king  alexander 
a leader  not a follower 
you need nothing
but that which
you already have 
i ve got it 
i know  i know where it is 
that s lovely 
excuse me  please 
sorry  this is an emergency 
sorry 
stand back  please 
we re on a mission 
clear some space 
quick as you can  thank you 
it s the same place 
glastonbury tor 
that s where
arthur fought morgana 
lance  kaye 
go along the cliff 
find the horses
and tie them up
at the top of the high street 
then meet us
at the amusement arcade 
bedders  you come with me 
we re knights 
we ve got a quest to finish 
all clear 
do it  bedders  go 
it s working 
bedders  you re a genius 
  hello 
  hello 
hello 
we d like to buy
some armor  please 
do you take 50p pieces 
the sun sets 
and if you do not defeat her 
then it sets
for the last time 
for tomorrow  the moon masks
the sun and all is lost 
this battle is yours  not mine 
journey with care   
be brave  chivalrous   
and remember the code 
there s no doorway 
there s nothing here 
i don t understand 
alex  look 
let me try something 
this is too creepy 
it s like no one s
been down here for centuries 
not since the dark ages 
when arthur trapped morgana 
we re the very first 
four doorways 
maybe we take one each 
what if it s a trick 
what if she s trying
to separate us 
right  we should stick
together  whatever happens 
but    which door 
wait  the sword will tell us 
it s this way 
behind the vines 
look at the walls 
they re moving 
they re coming for us 
they re everywhere 
stay close  form a circle 
there s too many 
lance 
kaye 
alex 
they ve got me 
alex  look 
you have to go  now 
i ll hold them off 
now 
go get her 
alex  alex  we re up here 
alex 
she s here  be careful 
let them go 
welcome  boy 
boy 
i ve been watching you 
you 
you ve traveled so far 
so far 
fought so bravely 
bravely 
i ve seen your world 
how you live 
the myths you believe 
who you trust 
it s all lies 
merlin lied to you 
your mother lied to you 
you have no noble blood 
you have no army 
you can t win 
the world is rotten 
alexander 
that s not true 
oh  but it is 
you sought the truth  child 
and you have found it 
  you are nothing   
  nothing 
     but a lowborn serf 
  serf 
  know your place 
  place 
i am
the last living pendragon 
the land is mine 
the sword is mine 
you are mine 
you re right 
i m nothing 
take it 
lance  bedders  kaye  quickly 
this way  hurry 
i think we did it 
that was amazing 
all hail the once
and future king 
no  please don t 
really  it s embarrassing 
if they catch us
with excalibur 
they ll take it away 
  we can t risk it 
  you re right 
is the lady of the lake
really in every body of water
in the whole of britain 
like  even
in a swimming pool 
  or a bucket of water 
  or a puddle 
stand back 
guess that s a  yes   then 
see you  sword 
see you when we see you 
where are you going  alex 
aren t you going home 
i m going over the walls 
then through the back window 
why 
i can t face her  bedders 
not tonight  i m too tired 
what are you going
to tell her 
the same as you 
the truth 
they won t believe us 
no one will 
so what 
it s over now 
good night  sir beddersvere 
that was a great adventure 
yeah  it really was 
good night 
your highness ness 
it didn t work 
she s not dead 
no 
you merely wounded her 
her fury and resolve
are doubled
and the eclipse
is in six hours 
but why  i did everything
you told me to do 
think  boy  think 
the code 
it must be the code 
but    i refrained
from wanton offense 
i spoke the truth
at all times 
i persevered   
 honor those you love  
mum 
alex 
how could you do this 
the police have been
looking for you 
i ve been worried sick 
oh  thank god you re back 
mum  i ve got something
to tell you 
we went on a quest
to tintagel 
i met my aunt sophie 
i know  she called 
i know you lied to me
about the book 
i know   
he didn t even sign it 
you did 
i know dad didn t care
about neither of us 
i m so sorry  alex 
i m sorry i lied  i just   
i    i just    i wanted you
to believe he was good 
i thought that if you
knew the truth 
it would hurt you  change you 
no  i m sorry 
i m sorry i was
angry with you 
nothing s your fault 
nothing 
you were just trying
to protect me 
but you don t need to anymore 
there s something
i have to do 
i have to go to school 
and i have to take the sword 
alex   
we have to have a serious talk
about that sword
and this whole
king arthur thing 
we will  but i have to
show you something first 
everything i said
about the sword is true 
i can prove it 
but first  we have to promise
never to lie to each other
ever again 
to always trust each other 
whatever happens 
do you promise 
i promise 
i promise  too 
now  don t freak out  okay 
lady of the lake   
this is alexander elliot 
if my quest is noble and true 
please return excalibur 
all the time i was
telling you to obey the code 
i d broken it myself 
morgana s not dead 
  oh  no 
  you re kidding 
she s coming back   
into the real world 
that s why we need defenses 
a fortress  a castle 
the mortes milles will rise
from the land
across the roadway 
they ll attack head on
in a great and terrible
multitude 
the eclipse gives us
one advantage 
it s not night or day 
so this time 
merlin can fight beside us 
but the five of us won t stand
a chance on our own 
we need to raise an army 
i m relying on you
three to set a good example 
so when the entire school s
out in the playground
watching the eclipse 
everyone behaves themselves 
is that clear 
  yes  miss 
  okay  miss 
why are all these
children walking towards us 
and what on earth
are you children doing 
turning up to school
in the middle of the morning
dressed like that 
saving britain
from eternal slavery
by an ancient 
undead evil  miss 
break is over  quickly
and quietly fall in line 
get in line  break is over 
everyone  gather round 
quickly now 
this boy has
a very important announcement 
my name is alexander elliot 
a few days ago 
i found a sword in a stone 
then i found out it wasn t
just any sword in a stone 
it was the sword
in the stone   
excalibur 
i know  i know 
i know it sounds ridiculous 
but it s true 
and i can prove it 
this boy  mertin 
is really the wizard  merlin 
and if you don t believe me 
then just watch 
how humiliating 
quiet  quiet  listen 
this country is in danger 
a sorceress called morgana
has been sleeping
under our soil for centuries 
waiting for her moment
to return and enslave us 
and that moment has come 
in two hours 
there will be an eclipse 
morgana and her army
of undead knights
will attack the school 
we need you
to help us defeat her 
all you have to do is kneel
and let alex knight you 
everyone who does
gets a sword and armor 
this isn t a game 
this is 100  for real 
flaming swords 
fire breathing horses 
so  don t step up
unless you re ready 
me and bedders
used to hate lance and kaye 
and they hated us 
we were sworn enemies 
but now we know
that s how evil tricks you 
it turns people
against each other
to distract them from itself 
because it knows
that if we fight together 
it doesn t stand a chance 
so  who will stand
with us today 
who will stand up
to save their friends 
their future  their country 
who will join us 
nah 
activa 
and  by the way 
this is instead of
lessons today 
excuse me  pam  forgive us
if we re speaking out of turn 
i thought we were taking an
hour out to watch the eclipse 
no one said anything about any
kind of historical reenactment 
my year 11 s are meant to be
off timetable
for intensive revision 
i just had all of these
made up 
ladies and gentlemen 
if i could have your attention
for a moment   
what s your name 
hector

take a shield

on each vaulting horse 
quick as you can 
then get ready to hoist

go  go

upper block 
and three 
right block 
and four 
legs wide 
and five 
use the weight
of the sword 
you must lure her 
trap her 
give me time to open a portal 
create a vortex 
then you must destroy her
so that she can never return 
it won t be easy  alex 
we can do it  merlin 
we don t have any choice 
we have to do it 
all battalions  stand by

the barricade

maybe she s not coming 
maybe it s over 
where s merlin 
hello  merlin 
you ve hardly aged a day 
an army of children 
did you think i might
take pity on them 
after all these years 
this is your plan 
there you are 
you have no pity 
these children have
more goodness and nobility
than you can ever comprehend 
but  merlin 
i have seen them
in their heated hovels 
with their toys
and trivialities 
with their ignorance
of nature 
of magic 
do you think these little rats
are worthy of this land 
of that sword 
of my inheritance 
  merlin 
  merlin 
yes  i do 
you and i are history 
morgana 
the future is theirs 
not ours 
they have no future 
let s go 
ready your ropes 
alex  don t die 
i ll do my best 
hey  come and get it 
over here  come and get it 
bedders  now 
help me 
go 
pull it 
pull  pull 
take cover 
come on 
hey 
hey 
hey 
lance  kaye  now 
choke her 
stop her breathing fire 
  ready 
  do it 
grab the rope 
back me up 
hurry  come on 
pull  harder  pull 
don t let go 
merlin  we ve got her 
we re ready 
merlin 
someone throw me a jacket 
get him a jacket 
merlin  speak to me 
are you okay 
i m sorry 
i ve nothing left 
i ve failed you 
no  not yet  you haven t 
magic potion  quickly 
ice cream  cherryade
and chicken nuggets   
liquidized 
alex  we can t hold her
for much longer 
so great 
you were so good 
well done  well done 
congratulations 
we did it  you did it 
well fought  we did it 
well done 
  bravo  congratulations 
  yes 
heroes  heroes all 
  yes  yes  heroes 
  woo 
yes  yes  yes 
well done  well fought 
well fought 
i ve seen
many great battles in my time 
the siege of guinnion fort 
the saxons halted
on badon hill 
but believe me 
none were fought as bravely
as yours against morgana
and the mortes milles 
you have truly surpassed
my every expectation 
merlin  we won the battle 
but britain s still the same
place it was before 
yeah  how can we ever
change anything else 
and  even with the sword 
who s ever gonna listen to us 
it s true  we re just kids 
that may be so 
yet know this 
there is a wise  old soul
within every child 
and a foolish child
in every old soul 
perhaps you have
more battles yet to fight 
they may not be against demons
or undead knights 
or won with swords or armies 
but even if you do not
wield excalibur 
you will still know
