we used to be happy 
my daughter jane 
only child 
  janie s a pretty typical teenager 
   computer beeps 
angry  insecure  confused 
i wish i could tell her that s all going
to pass  but i don t want to lie to her 
 horn honking 
jane  honey  are you trying

  congratulations

lester  could you make me

 mutters  indistinct 
nice going  dad 
 lester narrating  both my wife and
daughter think i m this gigantic loser 
and they re right 
i have lost something 
i m not exactly sure
what it is 
but i know
i didn t always feel this   
sedated 
but you know what 
it s never too late
to get it back 
hello  this is lester burnham
from media monthly magazine 
i m calling
for mr  tamblin  please 
well  we re all under
a deadline here  you see 
there s some basic information   
about your product launch
that isn t even covered
in your press release  and i d   
yeah  c   
can i ask you a question 
who is tamblin  does he exist 
 cause he doesn t ever seem to come in 
yeah  okay 
l ll leave my number 
it s 555 0199 
lester burnham 
thank you 
hey  les 
you got a minute 
for you  brad 
i got five 
so  yeah  i m sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here 
oh  sure 
times are tight 
you got to free up some cash 
you got to spend money to make money 
  right 
  exactly 
like the time that mr  flournoy
used the company mastercard
to pay for that hooker 
and she used the card numbers
and stayed at the st  regis for 
what was it  three months 
  that s unsubstantiated gossip 
  that s  50 000 
that s somebody s salary 
that s somebody who s going
to get fired because craig
has to pay women to fuck him 
jesus 
i mean  calm down 
nobody s getting fired yet 
   scoffs 
  that s why we re having everyone   
write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute 
that way management
can assess who s valuable   
and who s expendable 
it s just business 
i ve been writing
for this magazine for 14 years 
  you ve been here how long 
a whole month 
  i m one of the good guys  les 
i m trying to level with you 
this is your one chance
to save your job 
 carolyn  there is no decision 
you just write the damn thing 
   lester  you don t think
it s weird and kind of fascist 
  possibly 
  but you don t want to be unemployed 
  all right 
let s just all sell our souls
and work for satan  cause
it s more convenient that way 
oh  could you be a little bit
more dramatic  please  huh 
so  we finally
got new neighbors 
you know  if the lomans
had let me represent them
instead of the real estate king 
that house would never
have sat on the market for six months 
well  they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore 
their sycamore 
come on 
a substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property 
you know that 
how can you call it their sycamore 
i wouldn t have the heart to just cut
down something if it wasn t partially
mine  which  of course  it was 
    stereo  instrumental 
 woman singing 
  bali ha i  
  they call you   
      continues  indistinct 
  mom  do we always have to listen
to this elevator music 
no  no  we don t 
and as soon you ve prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that i m about to eat 
you can listen
to whatever you like 
so  janie  how was school 
it was okay 
just okay 
no  dad 
it was spectacular 
well  you want to know
how things went in my job today 
they ve hired
this efficiency expert 
this really friendly guy
named brad   
how perfect is that 
and he s basically there
to make it seem they re justified   
in firing somebody 
because they couldn t just come
out and say that  could they 
no  no  that would just be too honest 
so they ve asked us   
 chuckling  you couldn t
possibly care less  could you 
what do you expect 
you can t all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day 
i mean  hello  you ve barely even
spoken to me for months 
oh  what 
you re  mother of the year  
   muttering 
you treat her like an employee 
  what 
 shouts 
what 
i m going
to get some ice cream 
janie   
i m sorry i haven t
been more available 
i m just    i   
you know  you don t always

oh  great

oh 
so  turn out the light
when you come back to bed  okay 
 lester narrating  it s a great thing

i figured you guys might be
able to give me some pointers 
i need to shape up  fast

  what the hell do you
think you re doing 
  uh oh  mom s mad 
      continues 
bench presses 
i m going to whale on my pecks 
and then i m going to do my back 
i see you re smoking pot now 
i    i m so glad 
i think using illegal
psychotropic substances   
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter 
you re one to talk  you bloodless 
money grubbing freak 
uh    lester 
you have such hostility in you 
do you mind  i m trying to work
out here  unless    you want to spot me 
lester  you will not
get away with this 
  you can be sure of that 
    there are many here among us  
  that s    what   
    who feel that life is but a joke   
you    think 
 my job consists of
basically masking   
 my contempt for
the assholes in charge   
 and at least once a day
retiring to the men s room   
 so i can jerk off   
 while i fantasize
about a life   
that doesn t so closely
resemble hell  
well  you obviously have no interest
in saving yourself 
brad  for 14 years  i ve been a whore
for the advertising industry 
the only way i could save myself now
is if i start firebombing 
whatever  management wants you
gone by the end of the day 
just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me 
considering the information
i have about our editorial director   
buying pussy
with company money 
which i think
would interest the i r s  
since it technically
constitutes fraud 
and i m sure that some of our
advertisers and rival publications   
might like to know about it as well 
not to mention    craig s wife 
  what do you want 
  one year s salary with benefits 
that s not going to happen 
what do you say i throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot 
 laughing 
against who 
 laughs 
against you 
can you prove that you
didn t offer to save my job   
if i let you blow me 
man    you are
one twisted fuck 
nope  i m just
an ordinary guy   
with nothing to lose 
yeah 
  carolyn 
  buddy 
  i am so sorry to have kept you waiting 
  oh   chuckles 
christy left for new york

a little    hectic around the house 
  what s she doing in new york 
  she s moving there 
yes  we are splitting up 
buddy  i m so sorry 
yes  according to her  i m   
too focused on my career 
   scoffs 
  as if being driven to succeed is   
some sort of a character flaw 
 chuckling 
well  she certainly did
take advantage of the lifestyle
my success afforded her 
ooh  ha  wow 
 chuckles 
  ah  it s for the best 
  mm hmm 
when i saw you two at the party the
other night  you seemed perfectly happy 
well  call me crazy 
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful 
one must project
an image of success   
at all times 
what are you doing 
  i was filming this dead bird 
  why 
because it s beautiful 
i think maybe you forgot
your medication today  mental boy 
 ricky

i m looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility 
i don t think
you d fit in here 
i have fast food experience 
 laughs 
yeah  like 20 years ago 
i m sure there ve been amazing
technological advances in the industry 
but surely you must have
some sort of training program 
it seems unfair to presume
i won t be able to learn 
  that was exactly what i needed   
  mm 
the  royal treatment  
so to speak 
 chuckling 
i was so stressed out  ah 
  ah  ah 
  mm 
 both laughing 
know what i do
when i feel like that 
what 
  i fire a gun 
  really 
oh  yeah  i go to this
little firing range downtown 
and i    just pop off
a few rounds 
  i ve never fired a gun before 
  well  you ve gotta try it 
nothing makes you feel
more powerful 
well   
almost nothing 
  so  do you like your new house 
  i like it 
the people who used to live
there fed these stray cats 
so they were always around 
and it drove
my mother nuts 
and then she cut down
their tree 
is that a funeral 
yeah  have you ever
known anybody who died 
no  have you 
no 
but i did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once   
just laying there
on the sidewalk 
she looked really sad 
i got that homeless woman
on videotape 
why would you film that 
  because it was amazing 
  what s amazing about it 
when you see something like that 
it s like god is looking right at you 
just for a second 
and if you re careful 
you can look right back 
and what do you see 
beauty 
 clock ticking 
mom  i want you
to meet somebody 
  mom 
  yes 
i want you to meet somebody 
this is jane 
  hi 
  oh  my 
i apologize for the way
things look around here 
 door opens  closes 
 ricky 
this is where my dad hides out 
 jane 
i take it he s got a thing for guns 
you gotta see
this one thing 
my dad would kill me
if he knew i was in here 
did you steal his keys 
no  one of my clients
is a locksmith 
he was short on cash one night 
so i let him pay me in trade 
turn it over 
oh  my god 
it s  like  official state china
of the third reich 
there s a whole subculture
of people who collect this nazi shit 
but my dad just has
this one thing 
  what s wrong 
  nothing 
no  you re scared of me 
no  i m not 
you want to see the most beautiful thing
i ve ever filmed 
it was one of those days   
where it s a minute
away from snowing 
and there was this electricity
in the air 
you can almost hear it 
right 
and this bag was just   
dancing with me 
like a little kid
begging me to play with it 
for 15 minutes 
that s the day i realized
that there was this   
entire life behind things   
and this incredibly
benevolent force   
that wanted me to know that there
was no reason to be afraid   
ever 
video s a poor excuse  i know 
but it helps me remember 
i need to remember 
sometimes there s so much   
beauty   
in the world 
i feel like
i can t take it   
and my heart   
is just going to   
cave in 
oh  my god 
what time is it 
    lounge 
  sorry i m late 
  no  that s quite all right  dear 
your father and i were
just discussing his day at work 
why don t you tell
our daughter about it  honey 
  janie  today i quit my job 
   laughing 
then i told my boss to go fuck
himself  and then i blackmailed
him for almost  60 000 
  pass the asparagus 
  your father seems to think   
this kind of behavior
is something to be proud of 
and your mother seems to prefer
that i go through life
like a fucking prisoner   
while she keeps my dick
in a mason jar under the sink 
how dare you speak to me
that way in front of her 
and i marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me   
on the same day
that you lose your job 
i didn t lose it  it s not like 
 whoops  where did my job go  
i quit 
pass the asparagus 
oh  oh  oh  and i want to thank you for
putting me under the added pressure   
of being the sole
breadwinner now 
  i already have a job 
  no  no 
don t give a second thought
as to who s going to pay the mortgage 
we ll leave it up to carolyn 
 you re going to take care
of everything now  carolyn  
 yes  i don t mind  
 everything  you don t mind having
the sole responsibility 
your husband feels he can just
quit his job  and you don t    
will someone please pass me
the fucking asparagus 
  i m not going to be a part of this 
  sit down 
  and i m irresponsibly mad  
  for you  
  go on and call me  
  unpredictable  
  tell me that i m impractical  
  rainbows
i m inclined to pursue  
i am sick and tired of being treated
like i don t exist 
you two do whatever you want
to do whenever you want to do it 
and i don t complain 
  all i want   
  oh  you don t complain 
oh  please  excuse me 
i must be psychotic then 
if you don t complain  what is this 
yeah  let s bring in the laugh meter
and see how loud it gets on that one 
  mad for you   
don t interrupt me  honey 
    lush instrumental 
and another thing 
from now on  we re going
to alternate our dinner music 
because  frankly   
and i don t think i m alone here   
i am really tired
of this lawrence welk shit 
  a bright  shiny world  
 knock at door

me

the most important lesson in life 
you cannot count
on anyone except yourself 
 sighs

anyone except yourself 
you know  it s sad but true 
and the sooner you learn it 
the better

in my life

who used to fake seizures
at frat parties when she got bored 
who used to run up to the roof
of our first apartment building   
to flash
the traffic helicopters 
   chuckles 
  have you totally forgotten about her 
because i haven t 
 sighs 
lester  you re going
to spill beer on the couch

it s just a couch 
this is a  4 000 sofa 
upholstered in italian silk 
this is not just a couch 
it s just    a    couch 
this isn t life

and it s become more important
to you than living 
well  honey

 sighs

to send me to military school 
i told you this whole thing
about structure and discipline  right 
of course 
i got kicked out 
dad and i had
this huge fight 
he hit me 
and the next day at school 
some kid made a crack about my haircut 
and i just snapped 
i wanted to kill him 
i would ve    killed him   
if they hadn t pulled me off 
that s when my dad
put me in the hospital 
they drugged me up and left me
in there for two years

   lighter clicking 
 whispers

i know you think my dad s harmless 
but you re wrong 
he s doing massive
psychological damage to me 
how 
well  now i  too 
need structure 
a little fucking discipline 
i m serious  though 
how could he not
be damaging me 
i need a father
who s a role model 
not some horny geek boy
who s going to spray his shorts   
whenever i bring a girlfriend
home from school

someone really should just   
put him out of his misery 
want me to kill him for you 
yeah  would you

      continues 
not at all 
bad night 
not really bad  just   
strange 
believe me  it couldn t possibly be
any stranger than mine 
  it s only castles burning  
  find someone who s turning  
    and you will come around  
  jane and i had a fight 
it was about you 
she s mad at me because   
i said i think you re sexy 
do you want a sip 
sure 
   come on down
to the river of sight  
  and you can really understand   
  red lights flashing through
the window in the rain  
  can you hear
the sirens moan  
  white cane lying
in the gutter in the lane  
    and you re walking home alone  
   grunts 
  don t let it
bring you down  
  it s only castles burning  
    find someone who s turning  
  so 
    and you will come around  
  you gonna tell me 
what do you want 
  i don t know 
    don t let it bring you down  
  you    don t know 
    it s only castles burning  
  what do you want 
    find someone who s turning  
  are you kidding 
    and you will come around  
i want you 
i ve wanted you since
the first moment i saw you 
you are the most beautiful thing
i have ever seen 
  and the buildings
scrape the sky  
  cold wind ripping
down the valley at dawn  
  you don t think i m ordinary 
    and the morning paper flies  
  dead man lying  
  you couldn t be ordinary if you tried 
    by the side of the road  
  don t let it
bring you down  
  thank you 
    it s only castles burning  
  i don t think there s anything
worse than being ordinary 
    find someone who s turning  
  and you will come around  
  don t let it
bring you down  
  don t let it
bring you down  
  and you will come around  
  don t let it
bring you down  
  don t let it
bring you down   
i refuse to be a victim 
i refuse to be a victim 
i refuse to be a victim 
lester 
i have something
i have to say to you 
 heavy breathing

i don t get scared 
my parents will try
to find me

in case you wondered why i   
i wasn t    better 
what s wrong

and i would be a very   
lucky man

to be sorry about

  how s jane

before she d ever tell me about it 
 sighs

man  oh man 
man  oh man  oh man 
 gunshot 
 jane shudders 
oh  my god 
wow 
 lester narrating  i had always
heard your entire life flashes   
in front of your eyes
the second before you die 
first of all 
that one second   
isn t a second at all 
it stretches on forever 
like an ocean of time 
for me  it was
lying on my back   
at boy scout camp 
watching falling stars 
 gunshot 
and yellow leaves
from the maple trees   
that lined our street 
 gunshot 
or my grandmother s hands
and the way her skin   
seemed like paper 
 distant gunshot 
and the first time
i saw my cousin tony s   
brand new firebird 
 panting 
and janie 
and janie 
 gasps  sobs 
 panting 
 grunts  sobs 
 wailing 
and    carolyn 
i guess i could be pretty pissed off
about what happened to me 
but it s hard to stay mad when
there s so much beauty in the world 
sometimes i feel like i m seeing
it all at once and it s too much 
my heart fills up like a balloon
that s about to burst 
and then i remember
to relax   
and stop trying
to hold on to it 
and then it flows
through me like rain 
and i can t feel anything
but gratitude   
for every single moment   
of my stupid little life 
you have no idea what
i m talking about  i m sure 
but don t worry 
you will someday 
  ahhh  ahh  
  because the world is round  
  it turns me on  
  because  
  the world  
  is round  
  ahhh  
  ahh  
  because the wind is high  
  it blows my mind  
  because  
  the wind  
  is high  
  ahhh  ahh  
  love is old  love is new  
  love is all  love is you  
  because the sky is blue  
  it makes me cry  
  because  
  the sky  
  is blue  
  ahhh  ahh  ahh  ahh  ahh  
  ahhh  ahh  ahh  
  ah  ah  ah  
  ahhh  ahh  ahh  ahh  ahh
