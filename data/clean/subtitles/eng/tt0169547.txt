horn honking

lester burnham
thank you
hey les
you got a minute
for you brad
i got five
so yeah im sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here
oh sure
times are tight
you got to free up some cash
you got to spend money to make money
right
exactly
like the time that mr flournoy
used the company mastercard
to pay for that hooker
and she used the card numbers
and stayed at the st regis for
what was it three months
thats unsubstantiated gossip
thats 50000
thats somebodys salary
thats somebody whos going
to get fired because craig
has to pay women to fuck him
jesus
i mean calm down
nobodys getting fired yet
scoffs
thats why were having everyone
write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute
that way management
can assess whos valuable
and whos expendable
its just business
ive been writing
for this magazine for 14 years
youve been here how long
a whole month
im one of the good guys les
im trying to level with you
this is your one chance
to save your job
carolyn there is no decision
you just write the damn thing
lester you dont think
its weird and kind of fascist
possibly
but you dont want to be unemployed
all right
lets just all sell our souls
and work for satan cause
its more convenient that way
oh could you be a little bit
more dramatic please huh
so we finally
got new neighbors
you know if the lomans
had let me represent them
instead of the real estate king
that house would never
have sat on the market for six months
well they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore
their sycamore
come on
a substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property
you know that
how can you call it their sycamore
i wouldnt have the heart to just cut
down something if it wasnt partially
mine which of course it was
stereo instrumental
woman singing
bali hai
they call you
continues indistinct
mom do we always have to listen
to this elevator music
no no we dont
and as soon youve prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that im about to eat
you can listen
to whatever you like
so janie how was school
it was okay
just okay
no dad
it was spectacular
well you want to know
how things went in my job today
theyve hired
this efficiency expert
this really friendly guy
named brad
how perfect is that
and hes basically there
to make it seem theyre justified
in firing somebody
because they couldnt just come
out and say that could they
no no that would just be too honest
so theyve asked us
chuckling you couldnt
possibly care less could you
what do you expect
you cant all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day
i mean hello youve barely even
spoken to me for months
oh what

and youll be surprised
how much a ceiling fan can
cut down on your energy costs

and i knew
what they were thinking
just like i knew guys at school thought
about me when they jerked off
vomit
no i liked it
i still like it if people i dont even
know look at me and want to fuck me
it means i really have a shot
at being a model

really
well im the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it
grunts
lester i refuse to live like this
this is not a marriage
this hasnt been
a marriage for years
but you were happy as long
as i kept my mouth shut
well guess what
ive changed

when he feels horny
cause youre obviously not going
to help me out in that department
i see you think youre the
only one whos sexually frustrated
im not well then
come on baby im ready

with me mister
i will divorce you so fast
itll make your head spin
on what grounds
im not a drunk
i dont fuck other women
i dont mistreat you
ive never hit you
i dont even try to touch you
since you made it so abundantly clear
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be
but i did support you
when you got your license
and some people might think that
entitles me to half of whats yours
oh
so turn out the light
when you come back to bed okay
lester narrating its a great thing
when you realize you still have
the ability
to surprise yourself
makes you wonder what else you can do
that youve forgotten about
hey guys
lester i didnt know you ran
i just started
good for you
i figured you guys might be
able to give me some pointers
i need to shape up fast
are you looking to just lose weight
or do you want to have
increased strength
and flexibility as well
i i want
to look good naked
squeaking
oh what is this
fuckin gay pride parade
hey yo ricky
panting
my entire life is passing
before my eyes and those two
have barely broken a sweat
sorry hi lester burnham

colonel frank fitts
us marine corps
oh whoa well

ricky uh
i was thinking about the uh
i was gonna the movie we talked about
reanimator

okay its up in my room come on
can you hold this for a sec

i dont think my dad would try
to come in while someone else
is here but you never know
what is this
urine
i have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure im clean
are you kidding
you just smoked with me last night
its not mine
one of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatricians office

she keeps me in clean piss
you like pink floyd
i like a lot of music
man i havent listened
to this album in years
how much do you want
i dont know its been a while
um how much is an ounce
this is totally decent
and its 300
wow
this shit is
top of the line
its called g13 its genetically
engineered by the us government
its extremely potent but
a completely mellow high no paranoia
is that what we smoked
last night
this is all i ever smoke

two grand
jesus
things have changed since 1973
you dont have to pay now
i know youre good for it
thanks
theres a card in there
with my beeper number
beep me anytime day or night
and i only accept cash
now i know how you can afford
all this equipment
god when i was your age
i flipped burgers all summer
just to buy an eighttrack
that sucks
no actually it was great
all i did was party
and get laid
i had my whole life
ahead of me
my dad thinks i pay for all
this with catering jobs
never underestimate
the power of denial
humming
music playing faint
sniffing
there must be some way
out of here
said the joker
to the thief
theres too much confusion
i cant get no relief
what the hell do you
think youre doing
uhoh moms mad
continues
bench presses
im going to whale on my pecks
and then im going to do my back
i see youre smoking pot now
i im so glad
i think using illegal
psychotropic substances
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter
youre one to talk you bloodless
moneygrubbing freak
uh lester
you have such hostility in you
do you mind im trying to work
out here unless you want to spot me
lester you will not
get away with this
you can be sure of that
there are many here among us
thats what
who feel that life is but a joke
you think
my job consists of
basically masking
my contempt for
the assholes in charge
and at least once a day
retiring to the mens room
so i can jerk off
while i fantasize
about a life
that doesnt so closely
resemble hell
well you obviously have no interest
in saving yourself
brad for 14 years ive been a whore
for the advertising industry
the only way i could save myself now
is if i start firebombing
whatever management wants you
gone by the end of the day
just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me
considering the information
i have about our editorial director
buying pussy
with company money
which i think
would interest the irs
since it technically
constitutes fraud
and im sure that some of our
advertisers and rival publications
might like to know about it as well
not to mention craigs wife
what do you want
one years salary with benefits
thats not going to happen
what do you say i throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot
laughing
against who
laughs
against you
can you prove that you
didnt offer to save my job
if i let you blow me
man you are
one twisted fuck
nope im just
an ordinary guy
with nothing to lose
yeah
carolyn
buddy
i am so sorry to have kept you waiting
oh chuckles
christy left for new york
this morning
lets just say things were
a little hectic around the house
whats she doing in new york
shes moving there
yes we are splitting up
buddy im so sorry
yes according to her im
too focused on my career
scoffs
as if being driven to succeed is
some sort of a character flaw
chuckling
well she certainly did
take advantage of the lifestyle
my success afforded her
ooh ha wow
chuckles
ah its for the best
mmhmm
when i saw you two at the party the
other night you seemed perfectly happy
well call me crazy
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful
one must project
an image of success
at all times
what are you doing
i was filming this dead bird
why
because its beautiful
i think maybe you forgot
your medication today mental boy
ricky
hi jane
i want you to stop filming me

amount of responsibility
i dont think

i have fast food experience
laughs
yeah like 20 years ago
im sure thereve been amazing
technological advances in the industry
but surely you must have
some sort of training program
it seems unfair to presume
i wont be able to learn
that was exactly what i needed
mm
the royal treatment
so to speak
chuckling
i was so stressed out ah
ah ah
mm
both laughing
know what i do
when i feel like that

i fire a gun

ive never fired a gun before
well youve gotta try it
nothing makes you feel
more powerful
well
almost nothing
so do you like your new house
i like it
the people who used to live
there fed these stray cats
so they were always around
and it drove
my mother nuts
and then she cut down
their tree

known anybody who died
no have you
no
but i did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once
just laying there
on the sidewalk
she looked really sad
i got that homeless woman
on videotape
why would you film that
because it was amazing
whats amazing about it
when you see something like that

beauty
clock ticking

is a locksmith
he was short on cash one night
so i let him pay me in trade
turn it over

this one thing

no im not
you want to see the most beautiful thing
ive ever filmed
it was one of those days
where its a minute
away from snowing
and there was this electricity
in the air
you can almost hear it
right
and this bag was just
dancing with me
like a little kid
begging me to play with it
for 15 minutes
thats the day i realized
that there was this
entire life behind things
and this incredibly
benevolent force
that wanted me to know that there
was no reason to be afraid
ever
videos a poor excuse i know
but it helps me remember
i need to remember
sometimes theres so much
beauty
in the world
i feel like
i cant take it
and my heart
is just going to
cave in
oh my god
what time is it
lounge
sorry im late
no thats quite all right dear
your father and i were
just discussing his day at work
why dont you tell
our daughter about it honey
janie today i quit my job
laughing
then i told my boss to go fuck
himself and then i blackmailed
him for almost 60000
pass the asparagus
your father seems to think
this kind of behavior
is something to be proud of
and your mother seems to prefer
that i go through life
like a fucking prisoner
while she keeps my dick
in a mason jar under the sink
how dare you speak to me
that way in front of her
and i marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me
on the same day
that you lose your job
i didnt lose it its not like
whoops where did my job go
i quit
pass the asparagus
oh oh oh and i want to thank you for
putting me under the added pressure
of being the sole
breadwinner now
i already have a job
no no
dont give a second thought
as to whos going to pay the mortgage
well leave it up to carolyn
youre going to take care
of everything now carolyn
yes i dont mind
everything you dont mind having
the sole responsibility
your husband feels he can just
quit his job and you dont
will someone please pass me
the fucking asparagus
im not going to be a part of this
sit down
and im irresponsibly mad
for you
go on and call me
unpredictable
tell me that im impractical
rainbows
im inclined to pursue
i am sick and tired of being treated
like i dont exist
you two do whatever you want
to do whenever you want to do it
and i dont complain
all i want
oh you dont complain
oh please excuse me
i must be psychotic then
if you dont complain what is this

being in the hospital
when i was 15
my dad caught me smoking dope
he totally freaked and decided
to send me to military school
i told you this whole thing
about structure and discipline right
of course
i got kicked out
dad and i had
this huge fight
he hit me
and the next day at school
some kid made a crack about my haircut
and i just snapped
i wanted to kill him
i wouldve killed him
if they hadnt pulled me off
thats when my dad
put me in the hospital
they drugged me up and left me
in there for two years
wow
you must really hate him
lighter clicking
whispers
no
hes not a bad man
well youd better believe id hate my
dad if he did something like that to me

hes a total asshole
hes got this crush on my friend angela
and its disgusting
youd rather he had the crush on you
chuckles

as important to him as she is
i know you think my dads harmless
but youre wrong
hes doing massive
psychological damage to me
how
well now i too
need structure
a little fucking discipline
im serious though
how could he not
be damaging me
i need a father
whos a role model

put him out of his misery
want me to kill him for you

gunshot
jane shudders
oh my god
wow
lester narrating i had always
heard your entire life flashes
in front of your eyes
the second before you die
first of all
that one second
isnt a second at all
it stretches on forever
like an ocean of time
for me it was
lying on my back
at boy scout camp
watching falling stars
gunshot
and yellow leaves
from the maple trees
that lined our street
gunshot
or my grandmothers hands
and the way her skin
seemed like paper
distant gunshot
and the first time
i saw my cousin tonys
brandnew firebird
panting
and janie
and janie
gasps sobs
panting
grunts sobs
wailing
and carolyn
i guess i could be pretty pissed off
about what happened to me
but its hard to stay mad when
theres so much beauty in the world
sometimes i feel like im seeing
it all at once and its too much
my heart fills up like a balloon
thats about to burst
and then i remember
to relax
and stop trying
to hold on to it
and then it flows
through me like rain
and i cant feel anything
but gratitude
for every single moment
of my stupid little life
you have no idea what
im talking about im sure
but dont worry
you will someday
ahhh ahh
because the world is round
it turns me on
because
the world
is round
ahhh
ahh
because the wind is high
it blows my mind
because
the wind
is high
ahhh ahh
love is old love is new
love is all love is you
because the sky is blue
it makes me cry
because
the sky
is blue
ahhh ahh ahh ahh ahh
ahhh ahh ahh
ah ah ah
ahhh ahh ahh ahh ahh
