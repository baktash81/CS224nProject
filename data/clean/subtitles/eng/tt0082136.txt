my hamsters had an anxiety attack 
i couldn t leave him till
he was settled down 
he was acting so crazy 
he ate a piece of tail 
and henrietta wasn t

then he ate his treadmill  whoo 
they got vets for that  we got
other things to worry about 
hamsters are a big responsibility 
let me paint you a mental
picture  all right  victor 
i want you to think of your
hamsters as a little army
marching along on a treadmill 
running their little legs off 
just running as fast as they can 
making that engine just
purr right along the road 
oh  jj  what a wonderful
way to put it 
wouldn t it be great
if we could share the
glory of winning the
cannonball with them 
that would be a real team effort 
you  me  the hamsters and    him 
don t start with him  i don t
want to talk about him 
if you need any help

to talk about him

congress for a real budget
that will allow us to
play some real hardball 
i mean  this is our three mile
island and love canal combined

coverage to a minimum 
thank you

tonight s the night 
ok  i d like to welcome you all
to an event that s
sometimes been called
the automotive counterpart
to the bay of pigs 
you all are certainly the
most distinguished group
of highway scofflaws
and degenerates
ever gathered together
in one place 
we re gonna have a lot of fun 
of course  certain sceptics note
that perhaps 10 000
of the nation s
most elite highway patrolmen
are out there waiting
for us after we
start  but let s think positively 
think of the fact that there
is not one state in the 50
that has the death
penalty for speeding 
although i m not so
sure about ohio 
everybody is gonna get
a card like this 
when you leave  you re gonna punch
out here at this time clock 
3 000 miles  roughly 
away from here
is another time clock just like
that at the portofino inn 
the difference between
the two times
is your time across the country 
the record stands at 32
hours and 51 minutes 
believe it or not 
those guys did break the
55 mile an hour speed limit 
let s get that first car up here
