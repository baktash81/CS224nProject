i got a throttle thats been
sticking why dont you fix that
boss this is the
biggest coup in the
history of the safety
enforcement unit

congress for a real budget
that will allow us to
play some real hardball
i mean this is our three mile
island and love canal combined

little jaunt to california

excuse him good sisters
byebye
dont run off
tonights the night
ok id like to welcome you all
to an event thats
sometimes been called
the automotive counterpart
to the bay of pigs
you all are certainly the
most distinguished group
of highway scofflaws
and degenerates
ever gathered together
in one place
were gonna have a lot of fun
of course certain sceptics note
that perhaps 10000
of the nations
most elite highway patrolmen
are out there waiting
for us after we
start but lets think positively
think of the fact that there
is not one state in the 50
that has the death
penalty for speeding
although im not so
sure about ohio
everybody is gonna get
a card like this
when you leave youre gonna punch
out here at this time clock
3000 miles roughly
away from here
is another time clock just like
that at the portofino inn
the difference between
the two times
is your time across the country
the record stands at 32
hours and 51 minutes
believe it or not
those guys did break the
55mileanhour speed limit
lets get that first car up here
were gonna get this
thing under way
