i am the host of funkyzeit
the most important tv fashion show
in any germanspeaking country
apart from germany
funkyzeit is über influential
in fact austrian fashionistas live their lives
according to my in or out list
in autism
aus chlamydia
why is autism so cool at the moment
because its funny
great
through funkyzeit
ich have done interviews
mit everyone in the eurofashion world
can you look into this camera and just say
youre watching funkyzeit mit brüno
you are watching funkyzeit programme
with brüno and its really a great show
yeah thats cool can you do it like
even more like a kind of black guy
you know like an afrikanischer
like this
yeah yeah yeah
you are watching
funkyzeit programme with brüno
yo man fuck man welcome to the jungle
something maybe a bit more crazy
maybe show a bit of skin
or something like that
no i dont think so
or what about just like one kugelsack
one of the balls
no
and the most exciting
and amazing thing in the town
from the fashion streets of milan
only for the german girls my great hairs
yo man
modelling a lot of people think its easy
but its the hardest job in the world isnt it
its very hard standing in heels all day
and everyones watching you
so you have to make sure your walk is good
and yeah
yeah its really hard
cause youve gotta remember like
to put your right leg forward
and then put your left leg forward
and then like which one now
right leg again and then like the left one
and then sometimes you even have to turn
yeah and especially the turn its so scary
being the host from funkyzeit

ich decided to seek advice
from the wisest guy id ever known
i wanna speak to milli
from the pop dance group milli und vanilli
is he in heaven
and if so is he in the vip section there
he says hes in a place
with green trees and flowers
can i ask him if he has any advice for me
he says theres some sort of thing that you
will set up like a foundation or something
where there will be other people involved
that will benefit
okay thats a great idea cause if i do that
then ill definitely become world famous
absolutely
theres something that he could do
that could make me incredibly happy
can i kiss him now
of course
well good luck with your life
thanks to milli
ich could now see clearly
despite having an eyeful of schpunken
charity was a great way to become famous
also brüno just needed to find
the hottest world tragedy to fix
i want a charity that doesnt involve
too much effort
but is gonna really make a difference
you know really put me into the alist
is there something that you like
that you believe in
well im really into issues
yeah global warmings only getting worse
so
great
now i think that would be
thats something to get involved now
so we can just help ease the
like after us in order to help for our future
in order for everyone its just
a beneficial thing to be involved with now
im really into doing something
maybe for africa
okay
is that still cool or
saving some kind of extinct animal
whats going extinct right now
i dont know like elephants or something
and then make bracelets
thats so bad never mind
i was gonna say make bracelets out of a
make bracelets out of the extinct animal
thats not gonna really work though
because you need the
you cant take from the extinct animal
whats the coolest type of charity
to get into at the moment
save dafar
save what
save dafar
save dafar yeah
angelina jolie
is that in like iraqi or something like that
yeah thats in the its in yeah
yeah
is there anywhere in the world
that no celebrity has tried to fix
darfur is the big one now
yeah no it is
whats the new one whats darfive
yeah
yeah
ich was going to become famous
by solving a world problem
but which one
clooneys got darfur
stings got the amazon
and bonos got aids
luckily there was still one shithole
left to fix
the middleearth
mein plan was to get both sides to sign
a peace deal in front of the worlds press
making brüno über famous
hi i love your hat its great
hey great is that marc jacobs
lutz lutz start the car
lutz
why are you so antihummus
i mean isnt pita bread the real enemy
youre confusing hamas
with hummus i believe
hummus has nothing to do with hamas
do you think
there is a relation
between hamas and hummus
so was the founder of hamas a chef
he had created the food
and then got lots of followers
hummus has nothing to do with hamas
its a food okay we eat it they eat it
its vegetarian its healthy its beans
well do you both agree on that
we both agree that hummus is very healthy
so were making progress
lets try and get a solution right
cause im not gonna be here forever
will you the palestinians
agree to give the pyramids back
to the israelis
this is in egypt not in palestine
i dont care where you put them
give them back
this is about gaining something
for your own people
whether you believe it
whether you were convinced to do that
but in any case
all right okay take it easy girlfriend
all right
civil rights
if i did not get these queens
to sign a peace deal soon
i would not become famous
so i decided to think outside
the geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung
ive written a song that i think
is gonna help us make peace
in fact i know it will
ive written a song
that i hope is gonna bring you two together
its time for this war to end
jews and hindus you be friends
this is the middle east
creating love is my mission
dont kill each other
shoot a christian
ich bin brüno dove of peace
ich bin brüno dove of peace
ich bin brüno dove of peace
yeah a bit more than that
ich was out of options
my song hadnt worked und i didnt have
enough ecstasy for everyone
ich was ready to give up
when i suddenly remembered something
that the jude had said
in the last few years
people were kidnapped
and then they would
broadcast it to the whole world
to the whole world
yeah
so what the whole world gets to see
these hostage videos
of course of course
ich would become famous
by getting kidnapped
i am going to say something
that is gonna get you so angry
that if youve got a gun on you
youre gonna pull it out
and shoot me in the head are you ready
yeah
your hair is sun damaged
ill be honest with you i want to be famous
and i want the best guys in the business
to kidnap me alqaeda is so 2001
i dont like
can i give you guys a word of advice
lose the beards because your king osama
looks like a kind of dirty wizard
or a homeless santa
get out get out now
ich was encouraged
to leave the middle east
ich was encouraged
to leave the middle east
but brüno had a new plan
it involved stopping off in africa
on the way home for a little bit of shopping
mein little afrikanischer
freund was going to get me

also ich hired a top photographer
und held a casting for
the hottest baby photo shoot ever

excuse me can you unlock us please
hello can you unlock us
please can you unlock us
please my assistants about to shit
on my balls
whats going on here
what does it look like paul blart
brüno
brüno
ich was at a low point
brüno had hit rock arsch
lutz had gone und ich had only
9 freunds left on meinspace
lutz lutz
i was about to give up
on my dream of celebrity
when suddenly it hit me
all the most famous stars in the world
tom cruise john travolta kevin spacey
they all had one thing in common
they were all straight
to become famous
i would have to quit guys
ich just needed to find
a cockaholics anonymous
things have got to change
i want to become straight
awesome
once im straight
can i still play the clarinet
if it doesnt remind you
about some of the behaviour
that you engaged in
when you put your lips around it
if it doesnt remind you of that
then i say go for it
and play the clarinet
with everything inside of you
if it does remind you of that
then i say put it down
give it away let a friend hold it
until you know in your mind
youre ready to pick it up again
and it wouldnt remind you of that
und what about if
i put a flute up my stinker
that i wouldnt do that either because it
would remind you of the former lifestyle
so you dont put any woodwind
instruments up your arschwitz
absolutely not you know why
why
because that would harm my body
that would hurt
only if you lose the reed
okay
well that would that would be bad
is there any music that i shouldnt listen to
any bands
sinead oconnor the indigo girls
of course the village people
when i become straight
you know a kuntmeister
are there any new hobbies
that i should take up
do you enjoy hiking lifting weights
sure
man theres nothing like just working out
and lifting weights
and building your muscles
around some other men who are not gay
im totally irresistible to gay guys
they see me und they want to schtupp me
right
so how do i protect against those guys
if they get close to you
hit them and leave the situation
how do you spot the homosexual
very hard to do
because some of them dont even dress
no different than myself or you
amazing
you know
its kind of like terrorists
if a terrorist has infiltrated
a police department
and he dresses like the policemen
how would you know thats him
what are obvious things
that we can look for
obvious is a person thats being
extremely nice to them to start with
so if someone approaches you in the street
und is being very very nice to you
you know that they are a homosexual
most likely
how should i protect myself
from being attacked by homosexuals
they probably would attack from behind
so again if i am a homosexual
and im just trying to run in und kiss you
boom you done moved in the wrong range
right
lets say the homosexual
has got you on the ground
okay
und the homosexual you know
has got you down here
right
i go to pull this down
i want to lock this lock this leg here
touching
yeah
hit with the elbow
boom as i roll across
how do you protect yourself from a dildo
so lets say im trying
here you know
like that you know
und disarm the dildo
yes
is it harder to defend against a black dildo
no
great
one is just as easy as the other
to defend against
so im attacking
boom
like that
lets say i go down and i
trap it work the knees work the elbows

i love a woman with a vagina
yeah
my favourite
didnt see anything
we were just talking about vaginas
about what
vaginas the womans vagina
sharing stories
and saying how much we enjoy them
yes
really fantastisch
really wonderful things
its my favourite
this is wonderful
this is what rabbit look like
look at the 4 of us
we are so like the sex and the city girls

reverend bj found me
too much of a handful
and put me in touch with one of his chums
you look decent in that
look like a straight guy hows that
women are good for us
theyre good even though
they appear to us
to be terribly conventional
and we find that somewhat irritating
that they complain so much
right
but we need that
we need many of the things
that at first glance
are annoying and irritating
and women often dont stick to the point
theyre often talking about one thing
and then another and then another
and they never get back to the first point
maybe ever
i am repulsed by the idea
of making the sex with a woman
the important thing is to be around women
somewhat that you find tolerable
or interesting
and give them a chance to seduce you
how did you get into it
we actually our first time was on our
our honeymoon
yeah
of all nights for us to swing
the first time was for our honeymoon

and then when youre turned
the opposite way its reverse cowgirl
und what other positions are there
power driver

you dont want to be like this

all right and then
