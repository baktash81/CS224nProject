i am the host of funkyzeit 
the most important tv fashion show
in any german speaking country 
apart from germany 
funkyzeit is über influential 
in fact  austrian fashionistas live their lives
according to my  in or out  list 
in  autism 
aus  chlamydia 
why is autism so cool at the moment 
 because it s funny 
 great 
through funkyzeit 
ich have done interviews
mit everyone in the euro fashion world 
can you look into this camera and just say 
 you re watching funkyzeit mit brüno  
you are watching funkyzeit programme
with brüno  and it s really a great show 
yeah  that s cool  can you do it  like 
even more like a kind of black guy 
you know  like an afrikanischer   
 like this 
 yeah  yeah  yeah 
you are watching
funkyzeit programme with brüno 
yo  man  fuck  man  welcome to the jungle

and amazing thing in the town 
from the fashion streets of milan 
only for the german girls  my great hairs 
yo  man 
modelling  a lot of people think it s easy 
but it s the hardest job in the world  isn t it 
it s very hard  standing in heels all day 
and everyone s watching you 
so you have to make sure your walk is good 
and  yeah 
yeah  it s really hard 
 cause you ve gotta remember  like 
to put your right leg forward
and then put your left leg forward
and then  like  which one now 
right leg again  and then  like  the left one 
and then sometimes you even have to turn 
yeah  and especially the turn  it s so scary 
being the host from funkyzeit
means brüno s always
seated on the front row 
hi  how are you 
you have to lose some weight 
 the kettle is calling the pot black

 i don t think so 
i m sorry

 because you out  you humiliate me 
 i m so sorry i humiliate you

i m here with congressman ron paul 
who was the 2008 presidential candidate

 what happened 
 he s queer  he s crazy 
he put a hit on me  he took his clothes off 
i couldn t even schtupp rupaul 
how would i become weltfamous 
ich decided to seek advice
from the wisest guy i d ever known 
i wanna speak to milli
from the pop dance group milli und vanilli 
is he in heaven 
and if so  is he in the vip section there 
he says he s in a place
with green trees and flowers 
can i ask him if he has any advice for me 
he says there s some sort of thing that you
will set up  like a foundation or something 
where there will be other people involved
that will benefit 
okay  that s a great idea   cause if i do that 
then i ll definitely become world famous 
absolutely 
there s something that he could do
that could make me incredibly happy 
 can i kiss him now 
 of course 
well  good luck with your life 
thanks to milli 
ich could now see clearly
despite having an eyeful of schpunken 
charity was a great way to become famous 
also  brüno just needed to find
the hottest world tragedy to fix 
i want a charity that doesn t involve
too much effort 
but is gonna really make a difference 
you know  really put me into the a list 
is there something that you  like 
that you believe in 
well  i m really into issues 
yeah  global warming s only getting worse 
 so   
 great 
now  i think that would be   
that s something to get involved now 
so  we can just help ease the   
like  after us  in order to help for our future 
in order for everyone    it s just
a beneficial thing to be involved with now 
i m really into doing something
maybe for africa 
 okay 
 is that still cool or   
saving some kind of extinct animal 
what s going extinct right now 
 i don t know  like elephants or something 
 and then make bracelets 
that s so bad  never mind 
i was gonna say make bracelets out of a   
make bracelets out of the extinct animal 
that s not gonna really work though 
because you need the   
you can t take from the extinct animal 
what s the coolest type of charity
to get into at the moment 
save dafar 
 save what 
 save dafar 
 save dafar  yeah 
 angelina jolie 
is that in  like  iraqi or something like that 
yeah  that s in the    it s in    yeah 
yeah 
is there anywhere in the world
that no celebrity has tried to fix 
darfur is the big one now 
 yeah  no  it is 
 what s the new one  what s dar five 
 yeah 
 yeah 
ich was going to become famous
by solving a world problem 
but which one 
clooney s got darfur 
sting s got the amazon 
and bono s got aids 
luckily  there was still one shithole
left to fix 
the middle earth 
mein plan was to get both sides to sign
a peace deal in front of the world s press 
making brüno über famous 
hi  i love your hat  it s great 
hey  great  is that marc jacobs 
lutz  lutz  start the car 
lutz 
why are you so anti hummus 
i mean  isn t pita bread the real enemy 
you re confusing hamas
with hummus  i believe 
 hummus has nothing to do with hamas 
 do you think
there is a relation
between hamas and hummus 
so was the founder of hamas a chef 
he had created the food
and then got lots of followers 
hummus has nothing to do with hamas 
it s a food  okay  we eat it  they eat it 
it s vegetarian  it s healthy  it s beans 
well  do you both agree on that 
we both agree that hummus is very healthy 
so we re making progress 
let s try and get a solution  right 
 cause i m not gonna be here forever 
will you  the palestinians 
agree to give the pyramids back
to the israelis 
this is in egypt  not in palestine 
i don t care where you put them 
give them back 
this is about gaining something
for your own people
whether you believe it 
whether you were convinced to do that 
 but in any case   
 all right  okay  take it easy  girlfriend 
 all right 
 civil rights   
if i did not get these queens
to sign a peace deal soon 
i would not become famous 
so i decided to think outside
the geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung 
i ve written a song that i think
is gonna help us make peace 
in fact  i know it will 
i ve written a song
that i hope is gonna bring you two together
it s time for this war to end
jews and hindus  you be friends
this is the middle east
creating love is my mission
don t kill each other
shoot a christian
ich bin brüno  dove of peace
ich bin brüno  dove of peace
ich bin brüno  dove of peace
yeah  a bit more than that 
ich was out of options 
my song hadn t worked  und i didn t have
enough ecstasy for everyone 
ich was ready to give up
when i suddenly remembered something
that the jude had said 
in the last few years 
people were kidnapped 
and then they would
broadcast it to the whole world 
 to the whole world 
 yeah 
so what  the whole world gets to see
 these hostage videos 
 of course  of course 
ich would become famous
by getting kidnapped 
i am going to say something
that is gonna get you so angry
that if you ve got a gun on you 
you re gonna pull it out
 and shoot me in the head  are you ready 
 yeah 
your hair is sun damaged 
i ll be honest with you  i want to be famous 
and i want the best guys in the business
to kidnap me  al qaeda is so 2001 
i don t like 
can i give you guys a word of advice 
lose the beards  because your king osama
looks like a kind of dirty wizard
or a homeless santa 
get out  get out now 
ich was encouraged
to leave the middle east 
ich was encouraged
to leave the middle east 
but brüno had a new plan 
it involved stopping off in africa
on the way home for a little bit of shopping 
mein little afrikanischer
freund was going to get me
on the cover of every magazine 
also  ich hired a top photographer
und held a casting for
the hottest baby photo shoot ever 
we re gonna do like this religious theme
where my baby is gonna be
on a crucifix playing jesus
even though my baby s black 
so it s pretty cool  no 
that s cool 
it s kind of like that madonna video 
yeah  it s really edgy 
you know  we re turning it on its head 
why not  come on  whatever 
so  we re looking for 2 thieves
to be on the crucifixes next to my baby 
would you be ready for your baby
to be strung up on a crucifix next to mine 
fine  yeah  i don t mind her
being up on a crucifix 
sure 
is your baby comfortable with bees 
wasps and hornets 
george is comfortable with everything 
he s fine 
is he comfortable with dead
or dying animals 
yes 
great 
amateur science

extremely rapid acceleration

if there s a problem losing the weight 
would you be ready to have olivia
undergo liposuction 
if that was a last resort
and she didn t lose the few pounds 
then  yeah  we d have to do that 
great  fantastisch news

 where did they allow you
to get your baby from 
is your baby from australia 
i was in the middle east  like 
solving the crisis there 
no big deal  whatever 
and i flew back here to america 
und i stopped over in this country
called africa  right 
africa is a continent  not a country  baby 
get it right 
well  it is full of african americans 
it s full of africans 
it s full of people of african descent

so how did you find your son 
i swapped him 
 you swapped him 
 what 
swapped the baby for what 
 for an ipod

no  i gave him  like 
a traditional african name 
so what s the baby s name 
o j 
stand up  please 
i think you re using him as an accessory 
i think maybe because he s a black baby

like how some people walk in the park
with dogs to pick up girls 
that might be your cue
to get maybe a down low brother 
i don t know  what do you think 
i gotta be honest  he s a real dick magnet 
you brought some photographs
that you took with the child because   
i guess to demonstrate
how much you love the child

that s some mess 
all right  do we have another photo

excuse me  can you unlock us  please 
hello  can you unlock us 
please  can you unlock us 
please  my assistant s about to shit
on my balls 
what s going on here 
what does it look like  paul blart 
brüno 
brüno 
ich was at a low point 
brüno had hit rock arsch 
lutz had gone  und ich had only
9 freunds left on meinspace 
lutz  lutz 
i was about to give up
on my dream of celebrity 
when suddenly it hit me 
all the most famous stars in the world 
tom cruise  john travolta  kevin spacey 
they all had one thing in common 
they were all straight 
to become famous 
i would have to quit guys 
ich just needed to find
a cock aholics anonymous 
things have got to change 
i want to become straight 
 awesome 
 once i m straight 
can i still play the clarinet 
if it doesn t remind you
about some of the behaviour
that you engaged in
when you put your lips around it 
if it doesn t remind you of that 
then i say go for it
and play the clarinet
with everything inside of you 
if it does remind you of that 
then i say put it down 
give it away  let a friend hold it
until you know in your mind
you re ready to pick it up again
and it wouldn t remind you of that 
und what about if
i put a flute up my stinker 
that    i wouldn t do that either because it
would remind you of the former lifestyle 
so you don t put any woodwind
instruments up your arschwitz 
 absolutely not  you know why 
 why 
because that would harm my body 
that would hurt   
 only if you lose the reed 
 okay 
well  that would    that would be bad 
is there any music that i shouldn t listen to 
any bands 
sinead o connor  the indigo girls 
of course  the village people 
when i become straight 
you know  a kuntmeister 
are there any new hobbies
that i should take up 
 do you enjoy hiking  lifting weights 
 sure 
man  there s nothing like just working out
and lifting weights
and building your muscles
around some other men who are not gay 
i m totally irresistible to gay guys 
they see me und they want to schtupp me 
 right 
 so how do i protect against those guys 
if they get close to you 
hit them and leave the situation 
how do you spot the homosexual 
very hard to do 
because some of them don t even dress
no different than myself or you 
 amazing 
 you know 
it s kind of like terrorists 
if a terrorist has infiltrated
a police department
and he dresses like the policemen 
how would you know that s him 
what are obvious things
that we can look for 
obvious is a person that s being
extremely nice to them to start with 
so if someone approaches you in the street
und is being very  very nice to you 
you know that they are a homosexual 
most likely 
how should i protect myself
from being attacked by homosexuals 
they probably would attack from behind 
so  again  if i am a homosexual 
and i m just trying to run in und kiss you   
 boom  you done moved in the wrong range 
 right 
let s say the homosexual
has got you on the ground 
okay 
und the homosexual  you know 
has got you down here 
 right 
 i go to pull this down 
 i want to lock this  lock this leg here 
 touching 
 yeah 
 hit with the elbow 
boom  as i roll across 
how do you protect yourself from a dildo 
so let s say i m trying   
here  you know 
like that  you know 
und disarm the dildo 
yes 
is it harder to defend against a black dildo 
 no 
 great 
one is just as easy as the other
to defend against 
 so  i m attacking 
 boom 
 like that 
 let s say i go down and i   
trap it  work the knees  work the elbows 
how do you defend yourself
against the man with 2 dildos 
coming in  here  boom 
depending on his range  boom 
then to his face  boom 
okay  kick around  boom 
he can t do nothing from there 
and if he s just running
with his pants down 
here  boom  and then to the eyes 
 homosexual attacking your bum 
 leg here 
and then come in and break his arm 
take it here  take him out 
break his arms  boom  break his ribs 
break his arms 
okay  thank you very much  fantastisch 
 okay 
 it s very useful 
that s just totally different than
what i ve ever tried to  you know  work with 
so you were never gay 
it s ironic that you should have
amazing blow job lips 
well  these lips were made to praise jesus 
no  they were made for something else 
but you re just not using it for them 
well   
are there any activities you suggest
where i ll be surrounded
just by straight guys 
 let s go  let s go

he s here 
amazing 
that s exactly right  he s amazing 
you want to be famous 
you ll be one that s so famous  brüno 
you will prepare the way
for other young men all over the world
who want to come out of the homosexual
lifestyle and make a change in their lives 
and they ll say   if brüno can do it 
then i can do it 
 how did he change 
how did you change  brüno  
and they ll say   it s jesus  he changed me  
but he wants to come into
your heart right now 
are you ready to make that change

no  i m not 
okay  good   cause i just

absolutely 
 hi 
 hello 
 mike  brüno 
 brüno 
hey  great 
 i m donny 
 brüno 
robert 
 you ever been hunting 
 i ve never killed an animal 
although  i did once
suffocate a hamster in mykonos 
the women  eh  do you prefer the vagina
or the mammary glands 
 i prefer the vagina 
 me  too 
i love a woman with a vagina 
yeah 
my favourite 
didn t see anything 
we were just talking about vaginas 
about what 
vaginas  the woman s vagina 
sharing stories
and saying how much we enjoy them 
yes 
really fantastisch 
really wonderful things 
it s my favourite 
this is wonderful 
this is what rabbit look like 
look at the 4 of us 
we are so like the sex and the city girls 
no  we aren t  either 
which one are you  donny 
i ain t any one of them  i m donny 
that is such a samantha thing to say 
i ve never been
out of the city before 
you haven t  how s it feel 
i feel a bit vulnerable 
you know  i m 19 years old 
i ve got a perfect body 
you know  i really don t want to wake up
tomorrow morning und find
that i m torn in my arschenholer 
you probably ain t the only one 
me  either  definitely 
there s so many stars in the sky 
full of them 
makes you think of
all the hot guys in the world 
do we all share one tent
or what s more sensible 
i hope not 
all right  god damn it 
reverend bj found me
too much of a handful
and put me in touch with one of his chums 
you look decent in that 
look like a straight guy  how s that 
women are good for us 
they re good even though
they appear to us
to be terribly conventional 
and we find that somewhat irritating
that they complain so much 
 right 
 but we need that 
we need many of the things
that  at first glance 
are annoying and irritating 
and women often don t stick to the point 
they re often talking about one thing
and then another and then another 
and they never get back to the first point
maybe ever 
i am repulsed by the idea
of making the sex with a woman 
the important thing is to be around women 
somewhat  that you find tolerable
or interesting
and give them a chance to seduce you 
how did you get into it 
we  actually  our first time was on our   
 our honeymoon 
 yeah 
of all nights for us to swing 
the first time was for our honeymoon 
und what is your favourite position 
that would be missionary or reverse cowgirl

yeah  and so  if i m the woman   
don t worry  yeah  so what 
you d be sitting like that 
 and that s called reverse cowgirl 
 right  right 
and then when you re facing me 
that s called cowgirl 
this one here is cowgirl or reverse cowgirl 
this is cowgirl 
and then when you re turned
the opposite way  it s reverse cowgirl 
und what other positions are there 
 power driver 
 right 
69 
but this is the girl s position 
you don t want to be like this
if you re a guy 
there s missionary  doggy style 
so what s doggy style like 
you d be bent over  like a dog does it 
yeah  like that 
all right  and then
what would you be doing 
if you was a woman 
i would be humping you 
 no  show me 
 i m not gonna show you 
 you re a man 
 don t be a faggot 
come on  what s the big deal
