embalmed here in the egyptian ways
i followed him as pharaoh
and have now ruled 40 years
hello papa
i am the victor
but what does it all mean when
there is no one left to remember
the great cavalry charge at gaugamela
or the mountains of the hindu kush
when we crossed
a 100000man army into india
he was a god cadmos
or as close as anything ive ever seen
tyrant they yell so easily i laugh
no tyrant ever gave back so much
what do they know of the world
these schoolboys
it takes strong men to rule
alexander was more he was a prometheus
a friend to man he changed the world
before him there were tribes
and after him all was possible
there was suddenly a sense the world
could be ruled by one king
and be better for all
eighteen great alexandrias he built
it was an empire not of land
and gold but of the mind
a hellenic civilization
open to all
but how can i say it
how can i tell you what it was like
to be young to dream big dreams
to believe when alexander looked you
in the eye you could do anything
anything
in his presence by the light of apollo
we were better than ourselves
truly
ive known many great men
in my life but only one colossus
and only now when old
do i understand
who this force of nature really was
or do i
did such a man as alexander exist
of course not
we idolize him
make him better than he was
men all men reach and fall
reach and fall
in the east the vast persian empire
ruled almost all the known world
in the west
the once great greek citystates
thebes athens sparta
had fallen from pride
for 100 years now the persian kings
had bribed the greeks
with their gold to fight as mercenaries
it was philip the oneeyed
who changed all this
uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders
from the high and lowlands
with his blood and guts
he built a professional army
that brought the devious greeks
to their knees
he then turned his eye on persia
where it was said
the new great king darius himself
on his throne in babylon feared philip
it was from these loins of war
that alexander was born in pella
some called his mother
queen olympias a sorceress
and said that alexander was the
child of dionysus others zeus
but truly there was not a man
in macedonia who didnt look
at father and son side by side
and wonder
fortune follows bold ones
trust the ones who give you love
life has just begun son
her skin is water
her tongue is fire
she is your friend
take it
if you hesitate she will strike
remember that
never hesitate
yes
they are like people
you can love them for years
feed them nurture them
but still they can turn on you
dont hurt her
good
come
he calls me a barbarian
philip makes a mockery
of dionysus every night
women are the only ones
who know dionysus
my little achilles
stay alexander down down
what is it you want
six months did you miss me
no not here
proud bitch im still your king
king of what sheepherders
i am of achilles royal blood
the blood of herakles runs in my veins
you are nothing but a drunken whore
shut your mouth
you 10titted bitch from hades
which god could i curse to
have ever laid eyes on you
do you think people respect you
you think they dont know your bastards
damn your sorceress soul you keep him
here like one of your snakes
i told you not
i told you not
youll obey me
i will not
youll obey me or ill kill you
with my own hands
no no stop papa
obey me
your majesty no
in the name of the gods
he will never be yours never
in my womb i carried my avenger
in the world he grew up to
ive come to believe it was in
friendship that alexander found his sanity
you dont need much to fight
when youre in the front ranks of a battle
facing some northern barbarian tribe
courage wont be in the lining
of your stomach nearchus
its in the heart of a man
you dont need to eat every day
or until youre full ptolemy
you dont need to lie in bed
in a morning
when you can have some good bean soup
cassander after a forced night march
come on alexander come on
who will respect you as a king
you think because of your father
the first rule of war is to do what you
ask your men to do no more no less
good thats it
well done hephaistion good wrestling
thats what i want
come come come
you did well but you lost
now both of you congratulate
the other go on
would you want me to let you win
alexander
youre right
but i promise you i will beat
you one day hephaistion
it was said later that alexander
was never defeated
except by hephaistions thighs
although an inferior race
the persians control at least
fourfifths of the known world
but is it possible that the source
of egypts mighty river nile
could rise in these distant
mountains of the outer earth
if so an experienced navigator
could find his way here
by this river east down
into the great plains of india
out into the eastern ocean
at end of the world
and by this route up the nile
back to egypt into the middle sea
and home to greece
now if only these frogs
could look outward
and act on their favored position
at the center
greece could rule the world
why is it master in myth
these lands you speak of are known
india where herakles
and dionysus traveled
all these men who went east
theseus jason achilles were victorious
from generation to generation
their stories have been passed on
why unless there was truth to them
tales of amazons no alexander
only common people believe these tales
as they believe most anything
we are here precisely to educate
ourselves against such foolish passions
but if we are superior to the persians
as you say why do we not rule them
it is it has always been
our greek dream to go east
the east has a way of swallowing
men and their dreams
master
master
yes
master
out with it
why are the persians so cruel
oh come on nearchus
that is not the subject for today
nearchus
but it is true that the oriental races
are known for their barbarity
and their slavish devotion
to their senses
excess in all things is the undoing of men
that is why we greeks are superior
we practice control of our senses
moderation we hope
and what of achilles at troy master
was he not excessive
achilles simply lacks restraint
he dominates others so completely that
even when he withdraws from battle
crazed with grief over
his dead lover patroclus
he seriously endangers his own army
he is a deeply selfish man
would you say the love between achilles
and patroclus is a corrupting one
when men lie together in lust
it is a surrender to the passions
and does nothing
for the excellence in us
nor does any other excess cassander
jealousy among them
but when men lie together and knowledge
and virtue are passed between them
that is pure and excellent
when they compete to bring out the good
the best in each other
this is the love between men that
can build a citystate
and lift us from our frog pond
philip brought such as aristotle from
athens to educate our rough people
and growing more ambitious he now
planned the invasion of persia
the best you can do cleitus back
to the phalanx with you ill ride him myself
no one will ride that beast your majesty
not with your leg
hes been beaten far too often
my noble king
hes a highspirited animal yes
highspirited and worthy
of philip of macedon
for three and a half talents
i couldnt make a profit
on him but for you
why would i want such a beast
i already have a wife
do i seem so old
stay down stay down
hold him
a broken neck comes free hes
too nervous for battle sell him for meat
buy him for me father ill ride him
and if you dont
ill pay for him myself
with what your singing voice
ill pay you
i tell you that horse cant be ridden
lad his mind is broken
he can be ridden by me
if you can rule that horse
ill make him yours
at half the price
that horse will kill him philip
hell break the boy in two
will he
perhaps shell make
a musician out of him yet
the boy doesnt have the craft
he could hurt himself
hell have to figure that out
for himself its time
you dont like your shadow do you
its like a dark spirit coming up to get you
do you see thats us
its just a trick of apollos
hes the god of the sun
but ill show you how to outwit him
you and me together
bucephalus
thats what ill call you
strong and stubborn
bucephalus and alexander
come now lets ride together
hes got some titan in him yet
attalus cleitus for zeus sake
he beat you man
now bucephalus show them
my son
my son
you remember achilles
hes my favorite
why
because he loved patroclus
and avenged his death
and his fate
that he must die young
but with great glory
did he have a choice
yes he could live a long life
but there would be no glory
you dream of glory alexander
your mother encourages you
theres no glory without suffering
and this she will not allow
one day ill be on walls like these
prometheus stole the secret
of fire and gave it to man
it made zeus so angry
he chained prometheus to a rock
in the great caucasus
and each day his eagle pecked out
the poor mans liver
each night it grew back again so that
it could be eaten the next day
miserable fate
why
who knows these things
anyway
oedipus tore out his eyes when he
found out hed murdered his father
and married his mother
knowledge that came too late
medea she slaughtered
her two children in vengeance
when jason left her for a younger wife
my mother would never hurt me
its never easy to escape our mothers
alexander
all your life beware of women
theyre far more dangerous than men
herakles even after he accomplished
his 12 labors
he was punished with madness
slaughtered his three children
poor herakles
great herakles
all greatness comes from loss
even you the gods will
one day judge harshly
when im king like you father
dont rush the day boy you risk all
my father threw me into battle
before i knew how to fight
when i killed my first man he said
now you know
i hated him then
but i understand why now
a king isnt born alexander
hes made by steel and by suffering
a king must know
how to hurt those he loves
its lonely ask herakles
ask any of them fate is cruel
no man or woman can be too powerful
or too beautiful without disaster befalling
they laugh when you rise too high and
crush everything youve built with a whim
what glory they give
in the end they take away
they make of us slaves
pregnant so soon the little whore
he will marry her in the spring
during dionysus festival
and when her first son is born
her sweet uncle attalus will convince
philip to name the boy his successor
with himself as regent
and you
you will be sent on
some impossible mission
against some monstrous northern tribe
to be mutilated in one more
meaningless battle over cattle
and i no longer queen
will be put to death
with your sister and the remaining
members of our family
i wish sometimes you could see
the light mother
the truth is hes taken nothing from you
that youve not been long without
the only way is to strike
announce your marriage
to a macedonian now
beget a child of pure blood he would
be one of them not mine
and he would have no choice
but to make you king
there is still kynnane
eurydice was perfect if your father
that pig had not ravaged her first
say nothing more of my father
do you hear me say nothing
youre right
forgive me
a mother loves too much
who shall i sing to sleep
at night anymore
i wish i wish we could spend
more time together
like we used to when you were
the sweetest boy
theres never been time mother
since i was a child ive been groomed
to be ever the best
my poor child youre like achilles
cursed by your greatness
take my strength
you must never confuse your feelings
with your duties alexander
a king must make public gestures
for the common people
i know but you will be 19 this summer
and the girls already say you dont
like them you like hephaistion more
i understand
its natural for a young man
but if you go to asia without leaving
your successor you risk all
hephaistion loves me
as i am
not who
loves loves
in the name of dionysus
understand how philip thinks
for your own sake
your life hangs in the balance
his spies are inside your closest circle
stop
im his only worthy son
you crazed woman
hed never hurt me
even if eurydice had a boy
hed be 20 before hed let him rule
yes and you would be 40
old and wise like parmenion
and philips young son would be 20
like you now
but raised by him his blood
he will never give you
the throne now alexander
never
come alexander
drink this sadness away
if only thirst could quench sorrow
ptolemy
theres only one thing better
than winning a battle son
and thats the taste of a new woman
youll find it far sweeter than selfpity
pausanias you bore me
be gone with you
alexander i found you the right girl
whats your name darling
antigone
whats your name
antigone
i love you my little imp
and i love you cleitus
please no
there you go
would you prefer a seat cleitus
ill sleep in my grave hephaistion
while alive i prefer dancing
pausanias
whos your new friend
theres your new friend
please dont
a toast
a toast
i drink to our greek friends
and to our new union
macedonia and greece
equals in greatness
and to philip our king without whom
this union could not be possible
come attalus leave some
damn air in the hall
and last i drink to the kings marriage
to my niece eurydice
a macedonian queen we can be proud of
to philip and eurydice
and to their legitimate sons
alexander dont
what am i you son of a dog
come then
shut up
shut up
shut up all of you
this is my wedding
not some public brawl
insolent pup
apologize by zeus
before you dishonor me
you defend the man who called
my mother a whore and me a bastard
and i dishonor you
you listen like your mother
attalus is my family now
the same as you
then choose your relatives
more carefully
dont expect me to sit here
and watch you shame yourself
you insult me
i insult you
a man not fit to lick the ground
my mother walks on
you dog questioning your queen
shame
ive nothing to be ashamed of
you arrogant brat
ill marry the girl if i want
and ill have as many sons as i want
theres nothing you
or your harpy mother can do
why drunken man must you think
everything i do and say
comes from my mother
because i know her heart by hera
and i see her in your eyes
you covet this throne too much
we all know that shewolf
of a mother of yours wants me dead
well you can both dream boy
philip this is the wine talking
leave the boy itll wait
now
i command you
apologize to your kinsman
apologize
no kinsman to me
good night old man
and when my mother remarries
ill invite you to her wedding
you bastard
youll obey me come here
and this is the man who is going
to take you from greece to persia
he cant even make it
from one couch to the next
get out of my palace
youre exiled you bastard
banished from the land
youre not welcome here
youre no son of mine
everything suddenly changed for him
his father king philip was murdered
and alexander at 20
became the new ruler of macedonia
and breaking their treaties with us
dismissing alexander as an untried boy
several greek citystates
rose up in revolt
much to persias delight
and perhaps sponsored by their gold
truly alexander could love like no other
but to betray him was to rouse
a vast and frightening anger
and he massacred several thousand
men of that tragic city thebes
and sold the survivors into slavery
this as intended
stunned and defeated the greeks
and though in the end he treated
most populations with magnanimity
it is these exceptions
thebes gaza in syria and later
persepolis in persia and others
that are always remembered by those
who hate alexander and all he stood for
at 21 alexander invaded asia
with an army of 40000 trained men
and liberating one citystate
after the other
he conquered all of western asia
south to egypt
where he was declared pharaoh
of egypt worshipped as a god
it was in egypt that the
respected oracle at siwah
declared him the
true son of zeus
he finally provoked
darius himself to battle
in the heart of the persian empire
near babylon
it was mad
forty thousand of us
against 250000 barbarians
it was the day alexander
had waited for all his life
alexander son of a god
it was a myth of course
at least it started as a myth
i know
i was there
i saw his eyes
there
in the crack of the persian line
well go for the head
kill darius
the gods have brought him
to us at last
if i die its one macedonian
but the persians they cannot move
without darius command
here
right here we cut the throat
of the persian army
this is madness youll never get
within 100 paces of him
have you seen the sheer size
of his force
not if you hold them on the left
my brave parmenion
with your son philotas
for just one two hours tomorrow
and you unbreakable antigonus
the center phalanx
perdiccas
leonnatus
nearchus
polyperchon
if you pin them on the walls
of your sarissas here in the center
their cavalry will follow me
out to the right
and when bold cassander breaks
stretching their left a hole will open
then i and my cavalry
our revered cleitus
ptolemy and hephaistion
will strike through that gap
and deal the deathblow
to darius head
alexander even with luck timing
the gods we must rout them tomorrow
destroy their army completely
or well be picked apart by bandit tribes
on the long journey home
right
you speak of home
and retreat
but do you understand parmenion
babylons my new home
alexander
if we must fight
do so with stealth
use your numbers well we should attack
tonight when they least expect us
i didnt cross asia
to steal this victory cassander
no you are too honorable for that
no doubt influenced from sleeping
with tales of troy under your pillow
but your father
was no lover of homers
the lands west
of the euphrates alexander
the hand of his daughter in marriage
when has a greek been given such honors
these are not honors
parmenion theyre bribes
which the greeks
have accepted too long
do you forget the man who murdered
my father lies across the valley
alexander were still not sure if it was
persian gold behind the assassination
that is no matter
parmenion you know thats not true
your father taught you never to surrender
your reason to your passion
now i urge you regroup
fall back to the coast
raise a larger force
i would if i were parmenion
but i am alexander
and no more than earth has two suns
will asia bear two kings
these are my terms
and if darius isnt a coward
who hides behind his men
then hell come to me tomorrow
and when he bows down to greece
alexander will be merciful
by ares chains hes got balls men
i mean give the man his due
parmenion
and lads feast tonight
for tomorrow we will dine in hades
to whom do you pray
phobos
fear
a bad omen
more so for darius
ive come to believe that fear
of death drives all men hephaistion
this we didnt learn as schoolboys
it is the cause of all our misfortunes
so mighty crateros
your majesty
are you ready for tomorrows dawn
its been too long coming
the men are skittish as colts
good
fear makes men fight better
post your sentries alertly
but rest them well
dont worry general im known to sleep
with my eyes open as a babys arse
only because someone
might steal his loot sire
after tomorrow even the thrifty
among you shall be kings
the gods are with us your majesty
youll stain the ground with persian blood
ive always believed alexander
but this seems so much bigger than us
did patroclus doubt achilles when
they stood side by side at the siege of troy
patroclus died first
if you do
if you were to fall hephaistion
even if macedonia were to lose a king
i will avenge you
and follow you down
to the house of death
i would do the same
on the eve of battle
its hardest to be alone
then perhaps
perhaps this is farewell
my alexander
fear not hephaistion
we are at the beginning
blood makes the world rise
blood makes the rain fall
blood makes the earth grow
and in blood all men are born and die
blood is the food of the gods below
come bucephalus
today we ride to our destiny
company group regroup
phalanx turn right
phalanx attention
neoptolemus
i remember you the day
you took the siege tower at tire
you were a giant
and today how will you fight
dexippos by athena
how far was it you threw your man
wrestling at the last olympic games
will you match it with your spear
and timander son of menander
a great soldier to my father
i still mourn your brother addaios
who died so bravely at halicarnassus
what an honored family
you descend from timander
you fight for them today
youve all honored
your country and your ancestors
and now we come to this
most distant place in asia
where across from us darius
has at last gathered a vast army
but ask yourselves who is this great king
who pays assassins in gold coins
to murder my father our king
in a most despicable
and cowardly manner
who is this great king darius
who enslaves his own men to fight
who is this king but a king of air
these men do not fight for their homes
they fight because
this king tells them they must
and when they fight
they will melt away like the air
because they know no loyalty
to a king of slaves
but we are not here today as slaves
we are here today
as macedonian freemen
some of you
perhaps myself
will not live to see the sun set
over these mountains today
but i say to you
what every warrior has known
since the beginning of time
conquer your fear
and i promise you
you will conquer death
when they ask why you fought
so bravely you will answer
i was here this day at gaugamela
for the freedom
and glory
of greece
zeus be with us
cassander four columns go
where does he go
i dont know majesty
envelop him bessus
hephaistion go
phalanx
he makes a mistake pharnakes
yes great king
be brave men
steady on the left lads
bend if you must but never break
and keep watching the cavalry on the left
pick up the pace
prepare to repel chariots
cassander
forward men
left turn
infantry clear out now
hold your positions
hold your positions
we must fall back to the gully father
no hold
where is he were far too thin
get word to alexander
move
yes sir
come macedonians ride ride
shields break off
break off
the shields are here
drive for the hole
drive for the hole
drive for the hole
back and to the left
back and to the left
philotas philotas
father
go tell alexander yourself
and if he wont listen then survive me
and avenge this betrayal
pay attention lad
your father still watches over you
darius
find your horses
darius
go go
we can reach those mountains by sunset
go all night and catch darius at dawn
provision the horses
alexander
alexander my fathers lost
theyve overrun the flank
theyre into the baggage train
parmenions crumbling
alexander if you chase him
you risk losing your army here
and if we capture him
we gain an empire
you can run to the ends of the earth
you coward
but youll never run far enough
to parmenion
you bleed free my lord
may i tend to your wound
no hermolaus not now
theres far worse than me go to them
help them
your majesty
youre very brave
what shall i call you
glaukos my king
glaukos
and wheres your home
illyria
let your body go loose
think of home now
be brave again glaukos
and you will live on in glory
alexander
the persian empire
the greatest the world had yet known
was destroyed
and alexander at 25
was now king of all
alexander once said to me
we are most alone
when we are with the myths
phalanx
and thus it came to pass in a dream
as mythical to all greeks
as achilles defeating the trojans
at this one glorious moment in time
alexander was loved by all
but in the end i believe babylon
was a far easier mistress to enter
than she was to leave
sikander sikander
imagine the minds that conceived this
with architects and engineers like these
we could build cities
as weve only dreamed
aristotle may have called them barbarians
but he never saw babylon
we have enough gold here to support
three generations of macedonian armies
and macedonia would soon corrupt
cassander
wealth in great quantities brings the crows
not for the men who fought i trust
well pay them well antigonus
but not as mercenaries for future services
now you sound like philip
philip never saw babylon
no he didnt hephaistion
hello
hello
alexander i know you think me
a stiff old sod
but whatever our differences
know this day
your father would be very proud of you
thank you parmenion
i ask you to forgive me
my own anger my pride
they too blind me
yes the grandsons of goat herders
we now rule 2 million square miles
not if you keep giving it all away
none of you fear that this great fortune
may drive us all to destruction
you overvalue us
for as long as darius breathes
he is the legitimate king of asia
and i but the king of air
but he has no power alexander
hes lost in the mountains with no army
as long as hes lost philotas
he can be believed in
only when hes found will it be decided
it seems youve already
made up your mind
we must finish what we failed
to do at gaugamela
we must hunt darius down to
that was not your fathers mission
and i am not my father
come on have you so quickly forgotten
fortune favors the bold
by the gods what is this
no wonder darius fled
when he had this to come back to
i venture one for every night of the year
help me aphrodite
how will i go back to lysimache
after this
i advise you not to touch leonnatus
here ill take care of it for you
apologies
aristotle was perhaps prescient
do these images fool us with their beauty
and degrade our souls
great king alexander
the princess of the thousand roses
and eldest daughter of the formerly
great king darius
stateira
noble alexander
i come to beg for the lives
of my sisters
my mother my grandmother
you are not wrong princess stateira
he too is alexander
please
i plead for my familys lives
sell me as a slave great king but
look now
in my eyes
princess
and tell me
how would you like to be treated
as i am
a princess
then so be it
you and your family shall
be treated as my family
you shall live in this palace
as long as you choose
have you any other requests for me
my noble princess
no
everything i wish
i have
requested
requested
you truly are
a queen
yes she would be
a perfect match for you
but you do nothing
three months youve been in babylon
and leave me in pella
at the mercy of your enemies
of which you have many
antipater accustomed now to the power
that you have given him
i must watch him grow stronger
im certain that he communicates secretly
with parmenion who is dangerous
but beware most of all
of those closest to you
they are like snakes
and can be turned
general crateros
cassander is antipaters son
even cleitus your fathers favorite
and ptolemy your friend yes
but beware of men who think too much
they blind themselves
only hephaistion do i leave out
but all of them you make rich
while your mother and yourself
you leave in generous poverty
why wont you ever believe me
it is only a dark mind like mine
that can know these secrets of the heart
for they are dark alexander
so dark
but in you
the son of zeus
lies the light of the world
your companions will be shadows
in the underworld
when you are a name living forever
in history as the most glorious
shining light of youth forever young
forever inspiring
never will there be an alexander like you
alexander the great
remember bring me to babylon
as you promised
i can only help you for they know
if they harm you
they will face my wrath
as queen of babylon
its a high ransom she charges
for nine months lodging in the womb
bring her alexander
itll give her such joy
joy
when im the cracked mirror
of her dreams
stay with me tonight hephaistion
ill take my own bath
thank you bagoas
the generals question your obsession
with darius
they say it was never meant
for you to be king of asia
naturally
they want only to return to their homes
rich with gold but ive seen the future
ive seen it now 1000 times
on 1000 faces
these people want
need change
aristotle was wrong about them
how so
look at those weve conquered
they leave their dead unburied
they smash their enemies skulls
and drink them as dust
they mate in public
what can they think or sing or write
when none can read
but as alexanders army they can go
where they never thought possible
they can soldier or work in the cities
the alexandrias
from egypt to the outer ocean
we could connect these lands
hephaistion
and the people
some say these alexandrias have become
extensions of alexander himself
they draw people into the cities
to make slaves of them
but we freed them hephaistion from
the persia where everyone lived as slaves
to free the people of the world
such would be beyond the glory
of achilles beyond herakles
a feat to rival prometheus
who was always a friend to man
remember the fates of these heroes
they suffered greatly
we all suffer
your father mine
they all came to the end of their time
and in the end when its over
all that matters is what youve done
you once said
the fear of death drives all men
are there no other forces
is there not love in your life
alexander
i wonder sometimes if its not
your mother you run from
so many years
so many miles between you
what is it you fear
who knows these things
when i was a child my mother thought
me divine my father weak
which am i hephaistion
weak or divine
all i know is
i trust only you in this world
ive missed you
i need you
it is you i love hephaistion
no other
you still hold your head cocked
like that
ive stopped that
like a deer listening in the wind
you strike me still alexander
and you have eyes like no other
i sound as stupid as a schoolboy but
youre everything i care for
and by the sweet breath of aphrodite
im so jealous of losing you
to this world you want
youll never lose me hephaistion
ill be with you always
till the end
the campaign in the northeast of persia
turned into a hard guerrilla war
of almost three years
we chased darius towards bactria
but missed taking him by hours
he was dying when we found him sire
he asked for water
he drank and died
the great king darius had been betrayed
by his own commanders
fully honoring his corpse
alexander hunted down
these commanders into unknown lands
crossing even beyond
the river oxus into sogdia
we fought them as far as
the unknown steppes of scythia
where only legendary heroes
had once trod
the surveyors told us we were now on
the borders of where europe and asia meet
in fact we were totally lost
here alexander founded
his 10th alexandria
and settled it with veterans their women
and any who would dare the frontier life
unable to accept defeat in any form
alexander persisted in breaking
every tribe that resisted
until the day he received the head
of his last enemy in surrender
for alexander there could be
no pretender to the throne of asia
which now included all
of sogdia and bactria
it was here that alexander made
one of his most mysterious decisions
her eyes tell me
she cares for you alexander
perhaps too much
in the ways of my country
those who love too much
lose everything
and those who love with irony
last
your father must be turning in his grave
after all this a hill chiefs daughter
by athenas justice this girl has spirit
but whats the point alexander
just take her as your concubine
because i want a son
damn you philotas
then half your nobles have sisters
whod make fine macedonian mothers
to take an asian as my queen
not a captive is a sign of deep respect
it will bring us together unify us
which is not to say i wont take
a macedonian
as a second wife you insult macedonia
alexander
this is about the honor of our kingdom
exactly what can be won alexander
were in asia to punish them
for their crimes weve achieved that
seven years from home now we drift
from one far region to another
chasing nomads and bandits
when macedonia bleeds its manpower
for what to build roads in asia
to give these people cities
to found cities and expand
our reach is not to drift
what benefit to macedon
its far richer
look what you give them
with respect
had you fought better at gaugamela
when your flank was crumbling
how dare you nearchus
general nearchus to you boy
alexander spread our flank too thin
there was nothing my father
or any of you couldve done
philotas
alexander ive known you
since you were born
i supported you at your fathers death
at the very least for zeus sake
and in respect to the council
that chose you king
give us a macedonian heir
a macedonian heir
youve been heard clearly
but
parmenion after the wedding take two
brigades to babylon where i look to you
and antipater in greece to maintain
our empire and supply this expedition
ill winter with my army at marakand
i pray to apollo you realize how far
youve turned from your fathers path
damn you parmenion
by the gods and your apollo
what was in my fathers guts
wasnt overripe in reason like yours
he never lusted for war alexander
or enjoyed it so
he consulted his peers in council
among equals the macedonian way
he didnt decide based
on his personal desires
ive taken us further
than my father ever dreamed
old man
were in new worlds
alexander be reasonable
were they ever meant to be our equals
share our rewards
you remember what aristotle said
an asian
what would a vow mean to a race
thats never kept their word to a greek
aristotle be damned
alexander
by zeus and all the gods
what makes you so much better
than them cassander
better than you really are
in you and those like you is this
alexander
what disturbs me most is not your lack
of respect for my judgment
its your contempt for a world
far older than ours
and so 10 years after his mothers
insistence he marry a macedonian
through our union
greek and barbarian
the most powerful man in the world
took a girl of no political significance
why
some say it was for alliance
with the tribes
others the desire for a successor
and yet others said alexander
truly fell in love
who roxane really was
i doubt any of us ever saw further
than the pools of those black eyes
alexander
special for you
on this glorious occasion
i toast this great army
that has given so much
and in honor of them those of you
who set out with us seven long years ago
i pronounce all your debts paid forthwith
from the royal treasury
praise alexander
and in honor of my bride
my beautiful bride
we recognize the many women
whove shared the long road with us
and grant them dowries
befitting a proper marriage
and what about our boys
and lastly
lastly the gods demand no less of us
that your children be given
a proper greek education
and military training
under our protection
so as to be the new soldiers
of our kingdom
in asia
i found it in egypt
the man who sold it said it came
from a time
when man worshipped sun and stars
ill always think of you
as the sun alexander
and i pray your dream
will shine on all men
i wish you a son
youre a great man
many will love you alexander
but none so pure and deep
you
love him
he is hephaistion
there are many different ways
to love roxane
come
no
no no
you have no fear
its fitting
a man searches for a woman
at earths top
and finds her
the myth becomes real
great man
sikander
you i kill now
do it
end it i would do
i would do the same
ill die a fool for this
love
my life is now yours
you will have my son
who is this woman you call
your queen alexander
a hill girl
you with your breeding
already she makes enemies
with her strong clumsy nature
do not confuse us
i was never a barbarian as philip said
we are of achilles royal blood
zeus is your father
oh i understand she brings
you some happiness
but hear me when i tell you
act and act soon
after seven years people wonder
who is this king alexander
i have given you ample proof
antipater daily undermines your authority
return to babylon
and strengthen your center
or come home to macedonia
and reorganize
but do not chase your dream
further east
your life and mine depend on it
remember
my only thoughts are of you
as you too must face
your glorious destiny
think kindly of your mother
provide for me
protect me from your enemies
when you are gone
and remember always
it is i who love you more than any
if only you were not a pale reflection
of my mothers heart
who did this
tell me
hermolaus
never will you find a man
as devoted as i yes
the conspiracy deeply upset alexander
not only because it involved
the young pages
whod shared his dream
but more intimately
it implicated philotas
his companion from boyhood who was
captain of alexanders royal guards
alexander
remember me for who i am
i do remember you philotas
but not as you remember yourself
it appears to me and your peers that
the true weather of your soul is ambition
no
none of us defended philotas
i didnt do this
then again none of us ever liked him
and of course his power
was carved up by the rest of us
before he died we tortured him to find out
what his father parmenion knew
but this we never learned
what to do with parmenion and his
20000 troops guarding our supply lines
was a far more delicate matter
was he innocent in this
or had he decided to act
before age further withered his power
theyll be divided
the men will follow their king
alexander wont be there
necessity required alexander to act
the infantry will follow me
and he sealed the camp within the hour
of the first accusations against philotas
then go antigonus and cleitus
and go quickly
three days hard riding sent antigonus
and cleitus to parmenion
his soldiers accepted the finding
of guilt against parmenion
as they understood that the head of
family is responsible for the behavior of all
cleitus antigonus
parmenion
i remember a remark of bagoas once
that love eluded alexander as much
if not more
than finding the end of the world
in the spring alexander marched
an army of 150000
across the passes of the hindu kush
into the unknown
in his dream it was the promised route
to the end of the world
we were now a mobile empire
stretching back thousands of miles
to greece
cooks and architects
doctors and surveyors
moneylenders and wives
children lovers whores
and forget not the slaves
that anonymous bent working spine
of this new beast
ravaged or expanded for better or worse
no occupied territory
remained the same again
although devoted to roxane
alexanders visits
to her tent diminished
as a year then two went by
without a successor
wounding alexanders great pride
the surveyors are saying that zeus
chained prometheus up there
in one of those caves
they say theres a giant eagles nest
just above it
i suppose he drops down each night
to peck out poor prometheus liver
you remember what aristotle told us
of these mountains
yes i do
that when we reach these heights
wed look back and see macedonia
to the west
and the outer ocean to the east
but i fear this world is far larger
than anyone dreamed
a world of titans
the scouts have been up
every known trail alexander
there is no way across
except to the south into india
were we gods wed breach
these walls to the eastern ocean
we will alexander
in a few years time we will return
but first the men must see their homes
have you found your home
ptolemy
more and more i think
it will be alexandria
well at least its hot
and thais
she loved it there
women bring men home
i have no such feeling
you have babylon alexander
where your mother awaits your invitation
yes i have babylon
but each land each boundary i cross
i strip away another illusion
i sense death will be the last
yet still i push harder and harder
to reach this home
where has our eagle gone
we must go on ptolemy
until we find an end
india the land where the sun was born
fabled to be even richer than persia
had never been explored or conquered
from the beginning alexander struggled
to unify a land without a center
kings who conspired against one another
a labyrinth of tribes urged on
by zealots and philosophers
to die by the thousands
for their strange gods
crateros in the advance party
fought against men with hairy skins
who were tiny and lived
in the tops of trees
until hephaistion convinced us
these were animals
who imitated men
but wore their own skin
keep that away from me
they called this tribe monkey
monkey
incredible
look at his hands
look roxane
hello little man
do they speak
no but they do sing
and then there was the rain
never before had we seen water
that fell from the gods
for 60 days and nights
you know better machatas
whats your son going to say
come on man
the older you get the stronger
right my king
give me my horse alexander
ill be with you at your side
watch out for the serpent
hold it hold it tight
cleitus bring the snake healers
pauvanus someone bring pauvanus
wheres the bite
what happened
its to the neck
oh no zeus no
hold on hold on
be brave
be brave
oh zeus
our quest for gold and glory evaporated
as we realized
there was none to be had
tempers worsened
we massacred all indians who resisted
and with the local water putrid
we drank the strong wine
as we moved southeast
alexander often returned the lands
wed conquered to their defeated kings
so as to make of them allies
but this did not sit well with the army
who began to wonder if alexander
was on some crazed quest
to imitate the glory of herakles
give him a kiss
go on kiss him
give him a kiss
to bagoas
to bagoas
and to my mothers god dionysus
dionysus
who were told by our indian allies
traveled here before herakles
some 6000 years ago
to a hero
to a hero
roxane
you lose face
these indians
they are a low evil people
you dont try to understand them
i try
but this i know alexander
in persia you are a great king
here
they hate you
let us go back to babylon
there you are strong
well talk about this later
yes
later
talk
i shall come
tonight
and i shall wait
good night my king
your majesty
ill toast to bagoas
and the 30000 beautiful persian boys
were training to fight
in this great army
and to the memory of philip
had he lived to see his macedonians
transformed into such
a pretty army
to philip
to a real hero
philip
and to cleitus and his new appointment
as satrap of bactria
cleitus
thats a fancy way of putting it ptolemy
but we all know what a pension
and an exile is
after 30 years service
you call governing
this major province exile
has your majesty given any
of his closest companions
a province so far from home
then you wont make a very
good satrap will you cleitus
so be it
let me rot in macedonian rags
rather than shine
in eastern pomp
i wont quake and bow down
like the sycophants you have around you
hephaistion nearchus perdiccas
as governor of one
of our most asian of satrapies
cleitus does it not occur to you
that if my persian subjects
bow down before me
its important for them to do so
do i insist on greeks doing the same
you accept greek offerings
as a son of zeus do you not
only when offered
why dont you refuse
these vain flatteries
what freedom is this to bow before you
you bow before herakles
and he was mortal
but a son of zeus
how can you so young
compare yourself to herakles
why not
ive achieved more in my years
traveled as far
probably farther
herakles did it by himself
did you conquer asia
by yourself alexander
who planned the asian invasion
was it not your father
or is his blood no longer good enough
zeusamon is it
you insult me cleitus
you mock my family be careful
never would your father have taken
barbarians as his friends
asked us to fight with them
as equals in war
are we not good enough any longer
i remember a time
when we could talk as men
straight to the eye
none of this scraping groveling
now you kiss them
take a barbarian childless wife
and dare call her queen
go quickly cleitus
before you ruin your life
doesnt your great pride
fear the gods any longer
this army
this army is your blood boy
without it youre nothing
you no longer serve the purpose
of this march
get him from my sight
i dont serve your purpose
what was i serving when i saved
your puppy life at gaugamela
do you think wed be forced now
to mate with brown apes
alexander
turn out the guards
arrest him for treason
whos with him
no
whos with him
i call father zeus to witness
i call you to trial before him
and well see how deep
this conspiracy cuts
take him
you speak of plots against you
what about poor parmenion
you made me do your foul deed
have you no shame
hypocrite despot false king
you and your barbarian mother
live in shame
cleitus
oh my cleitus
let me pass
none can enter
i am the queen
i want to see him ive waited three days
he says none not even you
he needs me
no he doesnt
and he needs you
hephaistion you make a mistake
the army needs your reassurance
alexander
yes
like an old lover they forgive
but they will never forget
you know more than any
great deeds are done by men
who took and never regretted
youre alexander
pity and grief will only destroy you
have i become so arrogant
that i am blind
sometimes
to expect the best of everyone
is arrogance
then cleitus spoke true
i am become a tyrant
youre mortal
and they know it
and they forgive you because
you make them proud of themselves
ive failed
utterly
philip king of macedonia
and leader of the greeks
all my life ive waited to see greeks
grovel with respect for macedonia
today is that day
they say already
philip was a great general
but alexander is simply great
but if you ever insult me again
ill kill you
ive missed you
in the spring persia
youll command my horse from the right
im honored father i wouldnt miss it
for all the gold in the world
which one day youll have
making himself a 13th god
hes drunk so much wine my poor philip
hes lost his mind
your majesty
attalus
i hope the prince
is enjoying the spectacle
as much as our regent
hes very tired
hey
pausanias bring the rest of the guard
royal guard
to the arena march
no guard your majesty
in all this crowd
greeks all over the place
cleitus cleitus
my cleitus
this man you can
always trust alexander
treat him as you would me
hell guard your back for you
yes father
my people are guard enough today
let these greeks see for themselves
how i can walk through my people
then let them call me tyrant
bring the main guard in
after my entry only
cleitus make sure the wine
flows steady all day
i want them to like me
werent you told i go in alone
follow with the main guard
go on
go on
father its best i go with you
you want the world to see
youre my successor
is that what she wants
dont look so hurt all the time
alexander be a man
you count yourself lucky you were here
at all today after your public display
by herakles by zeus by all the gods
obey me this once
have courage father
and go on your way
rejoicing that at each step
you may recall your valor
and now our beloved king philip
in whose honor
these wedding games begin
pausanias i told you
the king is slain
the king lives
alexander son of philip
may the gods bless the king
youre king now youre king
may the gods bless alexander
alexander
alexander
get out
go
how can you behave
so shamelessly in public
because it was meant to be
this isnt how i wanted to become king
no one blames you
they blame me behind my back in secret
slander is not power
shame is
who killed my father
tell me
tell me or shall i put you on trial
for his murder
pausanias
he had help
did you help him
no never
why why would i
so many wanted it
greeks persians men
youre mad youre cursed
youve unleashed furies
you dont know their power
now who is exaggerating
even if it was the wish of your heart
thats a lie he was my father
i loved him
he was not your father
you owe no blood debt to that man
you lie and lie and lie
so many lies youve spun
like a sorceress confusing me
look at you look at you
you are everything that he was not
he was coarse you are refined
he was a general and you are a king
he could not rule himself
and you shall rule the world
youre so cursed by all the gods
when you speak like this
such thick pride
and no mourning for your husband
mourn
him
what do you know of philip
no alexander zeus is your father
act like it
my first act would be to kill you
you murdered me in my cradle
you birthed me in a sack of hate
hate you have for those
stronger than you
hate you have for men
i taught you my heart alexander
and by zeus and dionysus
you grew beautiful
damn your sorceress soul
your soul is mine alexander
no no
youve taken from me everything
ive ever loved and made me you
stop it stop acting like a boy
youre a king act like one
parmenion is with us for once
execute attalus without delay
confiscate their lands and root out
that family forever
eurydice never
laugh you monster
you heartbreaker
how will you live out the year like this
have you learned nothing from philip
no from you mother
the best
what have i done
to make you hate me so
one day you will understand this
but i have only you in my heart
i know what you need
now is the time
the gods favor you
great wealth power conquest
all you desire
the world is yours
take it
take it
he never saw his mother again
and while he was away
fighting the northern tribes
olympias had philips new wife
eurydice and her infant son murdered
by necessity
he had her uncle attalus executed
of course you have fears
we all have fears
because no one has ever
gone this far before
and now we are weeks from
the encircling ocean our route home
well build a fleet of ships
and sail all the way
back down the nile to egypt
and from alexandria
we shall be home within weeks
there to be reunited with our loved ones
to share our great treasures
and tales of asia
and to enjoy our imperishable glory
to the ends of time
follow alexander
ill follow you
what
silence
were with you alexander
peucestas
a hero
where are the amazons of myth
who dare to fight and kill men
where have they gone
well never leave you alexander
you meleager
who are these tribes ahead
compared to those weve vanquished
lysimachus
antigonus
you break my heart you men
afraid
crateros
crateros
and another one
crateros
crateros
my king
i dont like no bellyaching
i wont tolerate it in any of my units
i lost many a man
young ones never been with a woman
some died of disease
some were butchered in scythia
by the banks of the oxus
some died good
some just didnt get no luck
but they died
forty thousand i come over with
eight years ago
and we march after you
more than 10000 miles
in the rain and the sun
we fought for you
some of us 50 battles weve been in
we killed many a barbarian
and now when i look around
how many of them faces do i see
now you want us to fight more
of these crazy monkey tribes east of here
we hear talk of thousands
of these elephant monsters
cross a hundred more rivers
crateros good crateros
who better than you to speak
most noble of men
but you know theres no part of me
without a scar or a bone broken
by sword knife stone catapult and club
ive shared every hardship with all of you
you have my king
and we love you for it
but by zeus too many have died
you have no children alexander
and were just
humble men we seek no disturbance
with the gods all we wish for
is to see our children and our wives
and our grandchildren one last time
before we join our brothers
in that dark house they call hades
yes youre right crateros
i have been negligent
i shouldve sent you
veterans home sooner and i will
the first of you
shall be the silver shields
then every man whos served seven years
with full pensions from our treasury
and respected rich loved
youll be treated by your wives and children
as heroes for the rest of your lives
and enjoy a peaceful death
but you dream crateros
your simplicity long ended when
you took persian mistresses and children
and you thickened your holdings
with plunder and jewels
because youve fallen in love
with all the things in life that destroy men
do you not see
and you as well as i know
that as the years decline
and the memories stale
and all your great victories fade
it will always be remembered
you left your king in asia
for i will go on with my asians
to the jackals with you then alexander
we come for you and you discard us
shame
we want to go home alexander
were tired of glory
we want to see our wives
and children before we die
ive got children i havent even seen
i want to see my children
i paid for your bastard children
ive taken nothing for myself
and all ive asked of you
is one more month
shame
thats your king
what would your father say
ive taken you further
than my father ever dreamed
so go home i look to the
barbarians for their courage
i go east
he wants us dead
so we cant speak of his crimes
who said that
we wont make it to macedonia
you despicable coward come forth
make your accusations public
so you can have us killed
son of zeus
you desecrate your real fathers memory
or did you murder him like you did cleitus
hide in this mob because ill take your life
you men insult my honor my paternity
arrest him
and him yes
and you this loudmouth demetrius
you call me murderer
i have no such blood on my hands
and him
yes youll know the pain of treason
you mock my shame for cleitus and say
id harm a hair of my fathers head
arrest him
after all ive done for you you swine
you cowards traitors
come on then
where are your daggers
he drove on south to the outer ocean
in smashing the mutiny
and executing the ringleaders
he did nothing to my mind that any
general in wartime would not have done
but clearly the army was divided
and alexander was no longer
loved by all
stay calm
together we are strong as gods
cover with your left
strike hard with your right
fear is rot a waste of time
lock shields
battle positions
move
choppers prepare your knives
follow me
strike hard boys strike hard
come macedonians
why do you hang back hurry
cavalry
split to thirds regroup and encircle
oh no cavalry on me
follow alexander
charge charge charge
the phalanx is in jeopardy
meleager ride to pharnakes
and tell him return to the center
find hephaistion at the riverbank
and bring all cavalry to the center
we must reach crateros
before its too late
hephaistion to the center
come macedonians ride
ride
coenus get out of there
no
the horses wont go
on foot then
fall back men fall back
come bucephalus
tis only sun and shadow
you and i together
one last time bucephalus
isnt it a lovely thing
to live with great courage
and to die leaving an everlasting fame
come macedonians
why do you retreat
do you want to live forever
in the name of zeus attack
attack
alexander
alexander
the king is down
to the king
it was the bloodiest of his battles
pure butchery the end of all reason
wed never be men again
he lives alexander
men of macedon
were going home
what
what
were going home
home
were going
were going home
his life should have ended in india
but thats myth
in life herakles died of a poisoned shirt
given him in error by his jealous wife
making his devotions to the gods
at the end of the great journey
alexander bade the east farewell
and marched his army directly west
across the great gedrosian desert
seeking the shortest route home
to babylon
to this day there is no accounting
of how many died
it was the worst blunder of his life
and when he finally reentered babylon
after six years in the far east
alexander again seized the imagination
of the world by taking two more wives
just last night he was
its the water your majesty
he mixed it with the wine
but how can this be
typhus of india
i wouldnt tax yourself your majesty
a few good nights rest will do it
but no wine or cold
come doctor
i feel better
soon ill be up
we leave for arabia in the spring
and i couldnt leave without you
arabia
you used to dress me up like a sheik
wave your wooden scimitar
you were the only one
whod never let me win
the only one whos ever been
honest with me
you saved me from myself
please dont leave me hephaistion
my alexander
i remember the young man who wanted
to be achilles and then outdid him
and you patroclus
and then what happened
ours is a myth only young men believe
but how beautiful a myth it was
we reach we fall
oh hephaistion
i worry for you without me
i am nothing without you
come fight hephaistion
we will die together
its our destiny
well have children with our wives and
our sons will play together as we once did
a thousand ships
well launch from here hephaistion
well round arabia
and sail up the gulf to egypt
from there well build a channel through
the desert and out to the middle sea
and then well move on carthage and that
great island sicily theyll pay large tribute
after that the roman tribe
good fighters well beat them
and then explore the northern forests
and out the pillars of herakles
to the western ocean
and then one day
not 10 years from now
babylon with its deepwater harbor
will be the center of the world
alexandrias will grow
populations will mix and travel freely
asia and europe will come together
and well grow old hephaistion
looking out our balcony
at this new world
hephaistion
hephaistion
where is this doctor
i cant explain this your majesty
its not possible i swear by apollo
execute him
take him out now and execute him
come away come away
liars liars you all hated him all of you
get out get out now
be gone
be gone with you
harpies get out get out
are you drunk again
get out

who
many hated him
but i dont think any other
would have dared
hephaistion is dead

you monster
are you mad
youve taken from me all ive ever loved
may all the furies through time
damn your miserable heart obey me
alexander
i have your child alexander
alexander we have a son
no
the child
oh your majesty no
alexander i have your child
alexander my husband my king
we have a son
my poor poor illfated son
never touch me again
no
one last toast
before the dawn
to my old friends
and to the myths
to the myths
drink it down alexander
drink it down
yes come on finish it
to the next dawn
yes come
come to babylon i await you
your only loving son
wait wait
vultures wait
your son alexander
just three more months
please live alexander
alexander we beg you tell us who
who will rule this great empire
if you leave us
fear not were at the beginning
youre a great man
the myth becomes real
beyond herakles
when its over all that matters is
what youve done ill remember
zeus is your father
alexander the army will divide
satrapies will revolt
without orders therell be war
who will it be
pray tell us who
what did he say
to the best
he said to the best
what
no he said to crateros
to crateros
why would he say crateros
on the 10th of june
a month short of his 33rd year
alexanders great heart
finally gave out
and as he vowed
he joined hephaistion
but in his short life
he achieved without doubt
the mythic glory
of his ancestor achilles and more
his sacrifice was an early death
but in keeping
to his side of the bargain
i cannot help but feel
he conquered death as well
olympias transgression
in the murder of his father
is to my mind a probability
his a burden
alexander was too in love with glory
for him to steal it
but by blood and blood alone
he was guilty
no
the body stays in babylon
within hours
we were fighting like jackals
for his corpse
the wars of the world had begun
forty years off and on they endured
cassander in greece
crateros and antigonus in western asia
solucas and perdiccas in the east
myself in egypt
until we divided his empire in four parts
gentlemen we are not savages
cassander certainly proved
his will to power
when seven years later
he had olympias executed
and within 12 years he achieved
the complete destruction
of alexanders bloodline
when he poisoned roxane
and alexanders 13yearold son
the true heir to the empire
but the truth is never simple
and yet it is
the truth is we did kill him
by silence we consented
because
because we couldnt go on
what by ares did we look forward to
but to be discarded in the end like cleitus
after all this time to give away our wealth
to asian sycophants we despised
mixing the races harmony
oh he talked of these things
but wasnt it really about alexander
and another population ready to obey him
i never believed in his dream
none of us did
thats the truth of his life
the dreamers exhaust us
they must die before they kill us
with their blasted dreams
oh just throw all that away cadmos
its an old fools rubbish
you shall write he died of fever
and a weakened condition
yes great pharaoh
oh he couldve stayed home in macedonia
married raised a family
hed have died a celebrated man
but this was not alexander
all his life
he fought to free himself from fear
and by this and this alone
he was made free
the freest man ive ever known
his tragedy was one
of increasing loneliness
and impatience with those
who could not understand
and if his desire
to reconcile greek and barbarian
ended in failure
what failure
his failure towered
over other mens successes
ive lived
ive lived long life cadmos
but the glory
and the memory of man
will always belong to the ones
