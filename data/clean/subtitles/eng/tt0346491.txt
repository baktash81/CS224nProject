   embalmed here  in the egyptian ways 
i followed him as pharaoh
and have now ruled 40 years 
hello  papa 
i am the victor   
   but what does it all mean  when
there is no one left to remember   
   the great cavalry charge at gaugamela   
   or the mountains of the hindu kush   
   when we crossed
a 100 000 man army into india 
he was a god  cadmos   
   or as close as anything i ve ever seen 
 tyrant   they yell so easily  i laugh 
no tyrant ever gave back so much 
what do they know of the world 
these schoolboys 
it takes strong men to rule 
alexander was more  he was a prometheus 
a friend to man  he changed the world 
before him  there were tribes   
   and after him  all was possible 
there was suddenly a sense the world
could be ruled by one king   
   and be better for all 
eighteen great alexandrias he built 
it was an empire  not of land
and gold  but of the mind 
a hellenic civilization   
   open to all 
but how can i say it 
how can i tell you what it was like   
   to be young  to dream big dreams 
to believe when alexander looked you
in the eye  you could do anything 
anything 
in his presence  by the light of apollo 
we were better than ourselves 
truly   
   i ve known many great men
in my life  but only one colossus 
and only now  when old 
do i understand   
   who this force of nature really was 
or do i 
did such a man as alexander exist 
of course not 
we idolize him 
make him better than he was 
men  all men  reach and fall   
   reach and fall 
in the east  the vast persian empire
ruled almost all the known world 
in the west 
the once great greek city states   
   thebes  athens  sparta 
had fallen from pride 
for 100 years now  the persian kings
had bribed the greeks   
   with their gold to fight as mercenaries 
it was philip  the one eyed 
who changed all this   
   uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders
from the high and lowlands 
with his blood and guts 
he built a professional army   
   that brought the devious greeks
to their knees 
he then turned his eye on persia   
   where it was said
the new great king darius himself   
   on his throne in babylon  feared philip 
it was from these loins of war
that alexander was born  in pella 
some called his mother 
queen olympias  a sorceress   
   and said that alexander was the
child of dionysus  others  zeus 
but truly  there was not a man
in macedonia who didn t look   
   at father and son  side by side 
and wonder 
fortune follows bold ones
trust the ones who give you love
life has just begun  son
her skin is water 
her tongue is fire 
she is your friend 
take it 
if you hesitate  she will strike 
remember that 
never hesitate 
yes 
they are like people 
you can love them for years 
feed them  nurture them   
   but still  they can turn on you 
don t hurt her 
good 
come 
he calls me a barbarian 
philip makes a mockery
of dionysus every night 
women are the only ones
who know dionysus 
my little achilles 
stay  alexander  down  down 
what is it you want 
six months  did you miss me 
  no  not here 
  proud bitch  i m still your king 
king of what  sheepherders 
  i am of achilles  royal blood 
  the blood of herakles runs in my veins 
  you are nothing but a drunken whore 
  shut your mouth 
you 10 titted bitch from hades 
which god could i curse to
have ever laid eyes on you 
do you think people respect you 
you think they don t know your bastards 
damn your sorceress soul  you keep him
here like one of your snakes 
i told you not 
i told you not 
  you ll obey me 
  i will not 
you ll obey me  or i ll kill you
with my own hands 
no  no  stop  papa 
  obey me 
  your majesty  no 
in the name of the gods 
he will never be yours  never 
in my womb  i carried my avenger 
in the world he grew up to   
   i ve come to believe it was in
friendship that alexander found his sanity 
you don t need much to fight 
when you re in the front ranks of a battle 
facing some northern barbarian tribe   
   courage won t be in the lining
of your stomach  nearchus 
it s in the heart of a man 
you don t need to eat every day
or until you re full  ptolemy 
you don t need to lie in bed
in a morning   
   when you can have some good bean soup 
cassander  after a forced night march 
come on  alexander  come on 
who will respect you as a king 
you think because of your father 
the first rule of war is to do what you
ask your men to do  no more  no less 
good  that s it 
well done  hephaistion  good wrestling 
that s what i want 
come  come  come 
you did well  but you lost 
now  both of you  congratulate
the other  go on 
would you want me to let you win 
alexander 
you re right 
but i promise you  i will beat
you one day  hephaistion 
it was said later that alexander
was never defeated   
   except by hephaistion s thighs 
although an inferior race   
   the persians control at least
four fifths of the known world 
but is it possible that the source
of egypt s mighty river nile   
   could rise in these distant
mountains of the outer earth 
if so  an experienced navigator
could find his way here   
   by this river east  down
into the great plains of india   
   out into the eastern ocean
at end of the world   
   and by this route up the nile   
   back to egypt  into the middle sea
and home to greece 
now  if only these frogs
could look outward   
   and act on their favored position
at the center   
   greece could rule the world 
why is it  master  in myth 
these lands you speak of are known 
india  where herakles
and dionysus traveled 
all these men who went east 
theseus  jason  achilles  were victorious 
from generation to generation 
their stories have been passed on 
why  unless there was truth to them 
tales of amazons  no  alexander 
only common people believe these tales 
as they believe most anything 
we are here precisely to educate
ourselves against such foolish passions 
but if we are superior to the persians 
as you say  why do we not rule them 
it is    it has always been
our greek dream to go east 
the east has a way of swallowing
men and their dreams 
master 
  master 
  yes 
  master 
  out with it 
  why are the persians so cruel 
  oh  come on  nearchus 
that is not the subject for today 
nearchus 
but it is true that the oriental races
are known for their barbarity   
   and their slavish devotion
to their senses 
excess in all things is the undoing of men 
that is why we greeks are superior 
we practice control of our senses 
moderation  we hope 
and what of achilles at troy  master 
  was he not excessive 
  achilles simply lacks restraint 
he dominates others so completely that
even when he withdraws from battle   
   crazed with grief over
his dead lover  patroclus   
   he seriously endangers his own army 
he is a deeply selfish man 
would you say the love between achilles
and patroclus is a corrupting one 
when men lie together in lust 
it is a surrender to the passions   
   and does nothing
for the excellence in us 
nor does any other excess  cassander 
jealousy among them 
but when men lie together  and knowledge
and virtue are passed between them   
   that is pure and excellent 
when they compete to bring out the good 
the best in each other   
   this is the love between men that
can build a city state   
   and lift us from our frog pond 
philip brought such as aristotle from
athens to educate our rough people 
and growing more ambitious  he now
planned the invasion of persia 
the best you can do  cleitus  back
to the phalanx with you  i ll ride him myself 
no one will ride that beast  your majesty 
not with your leg 
he s been beaten far too often 
my noble king 
he s a high spirited animal  yes 
high spirited and worthy
of philip of macedon 
for three and a half talents   
   i couldn t make a profit
on him  but for you   
why would i want such a beast 
i already have a wife 
do i seem so old 
  stay down  stay down 
  hold him 
a broken neck comes free  he s
too nervous for battle  sell him for meat 
buy him for me  father  i ll ride him 
and if you don t 
  i ll pay for him myself 
  with what  your singing voice 
i ll pay you 
i tell you  that horse can t be ridden 
lad  his mind is broken 
he can be ridden  by me 
if you can rule that horse 
i ll make him yours   
   at half the price 
that horse will kill him  philip 
  he ll break the boy in two 
  will he 
perhaps she ll make
a musician out of him yet 
the boy doesn t have the craft 
he could hurt himself 
he ll have to figure that out
for himself  it s time 
you don t like your shadow  do you 
it s like a dark spirit coming up to get you 
do you see  that s us 
it s just a trick of apollo s 
he s the god of the sun 
but i ll show you how to outwit him 
you and me together 
bucephalus 
that s what i ll call you 
strong and stubborn 
bucephalus and alexander 
come now  let s ride together 
he s got some titan in him yet 
attalus  cleitus  for zeus  sake 
he beat you  man 
now  bucephalus  show them 
my son 
my son 
you remember achilles 
  he s my favorite 
  why 
because he loved patroclus
and avenged his death 
and his fate 
that he must die young
but with great glory 
did he have a choice 
yes  he could live a long life 
but there would be no glory 
you dream of glory  alexander 
your mother encourages you 
there s no glory without suffering 
and this she will not allow 
one day  i ll be on walls like these 
prometheus stole the secret
of fire and gave it to man 
it made zeus so angry   
   he chained prometheus to a rock
in the great caucasus   
   and each day  his eagle pecked out
the poor man s liver 
each night  it grew back again so that
it could be eaten the next day 
miserable fate 
why 
who knows these things 
anyway   
oedipus tore out his eyes when he
found out he d murdered his father   
   and married his mother 
knowledge that came too late 
medea  she slaughtered
her two children in vengeance   
   when jason left her for a younger wife 
my mother would never hurt me 
it s never easy to escape our mothers 
alexander 
all your life  beware of women 
they re far more dangerous than men 
herakles  even after he accomplished
his 12 labors   
   he was punished with madness 
slaughtered his three children 
poor herakles 
great herakles 
all greatness comes from loss 
even you  the gods will
one day judge harshly 
when i m king like you  father 
don t rush the day  boy  you risk all 
my father threw me into battle
before i knew how to fight 
when i killed my first man  he said 
 now you know  
i hated him then 
but i understand why now 
a king isn t born  alexander 
he s made by steel and by suffering 
a king must know
how to hurt those he loves 
it s lonely  ask herakles 
ask any of them  fate is cruel 
no man or woman can be too powerful
or too beautiful without disaster befalling 
they laugh when you rise too high and
crush everything you ve built with a whim 
what glory they give 
in the end  they take away 
they make of us slaves 
pregnant so soon  the little whore 
he will marry her in the spring 
during dionysus  festival   
   and when her first son is born   
   her sweet uncle attalus will convince
philip to name the boy his successor   
   with himself as regent 
and you   
   you will be sent on
some impossible mission   
   against some monstrous northern tribe   
   to be mutilated in one more
meaningless battle over cattle 
and i  no longer queen 
will be put to death   
   with your sister and the remaining
members of our family 
i wish sometimes you could see
the light  mother 
the truth is  he s taken nothing from you
that you ve not been long without 
the only way is to strike 
announce your marriage
to a macedonian now 
beget a child of pure blood  he would
be one of them  not mine   
   and he would have no choice
but to make you king 
there is still kynnane 
eurydice was perfect  if your father 
that pig  had not ravaged her first 
say nothing more of my father 
do you hear me  say nothing 
you re right 
forgive me 
a mother loves too much 
who shall i sing to sleep
at night anymore 
i wish    i wish we could spend
more time together 
like we used to  when you were
the sweetest boy 
there s never been time  mother 
since i was a child  i ve been groomed
to be ever the best 
my poor child  you re like achilles   
   cursed by your greatness 
take my strength 
you must never confuse your feelings
with your duties  alexander 
a king must make public gestures
for the common people 
i know  but you will be 19 this summer   
   and the girls already say you don t
like them  you like hephaistion more 
i understand 
it s natural for a young man 
but if you go to asia without leaving
your successor  you risk all 
hephaistion loves me 
as i am   
   not who 
loves  loves 
in the name of dionysus   
   understand how philip thinks 
for your own sake 
your life hangs in the balance 
  his spies are inside your closest circle 
  stop 
i m his only worthy son 
you crazed woman 
he d never hurt me 
even if eurydice had a boy 
he d be 20 before he d let him rule 
yes  and you would be 40 
old and wise like parmenion 
and philip s young son would be 20 
like you now 
but raised by him  his blood 
he will never give you
the throne now  alexander 
never 
come  alexander 
drink this sadness away 
if only thirst could quench sorrow 
ptolemy 
there s only one thing better
than winning a battle  son   
   and that s the taste of a new woman 
you ll find it far sweeter than self pity 
pausanias  you bore me 
be gone with you 
alexander  i found you the right girl 
  what s your name  darling 
  antigone 
  what s your name 
  antigone 
i love you  my little imp 
and i love you  cleitus 
  please  no 
  there you go 
would you prefer a seat  cleitus 
i ll sleep in my grave  hephaistion 
while alive  i prefer dancing 
pausanias 
who s your new friend 
  there s your new friend 
  please don t 
a toast 
a toast 
i drink to our greek friends
and to our new union   
   macedonia and greece 
equals in greatness 
and to philip  our king  without whom
this union could not be possible 
come  attalus  leave some
damn air in the hall 
and last  i drink to the king s marriage
to my niece  eurydice   
   a macedonian queen we can be proud of 
to philip and eurydice   
   and to their legitimate sons 
alexander  don t 
what am i  you son of a dog 
come  then 
  shut up 
  shut up 
shut up  all of you 
this is my wedding 
not some public brawl 
insolent pup 
apologize  by zeus 
before you dishonor me 
you defend the man who called
my mother a whore and me a bastard 
  and i dishonor you 
  you listen like your mother 
attalus is my family now 
the same as you 
then choose your relatives
more carefully 
don t expect me to sit here
and watch you shame yourself 
  you insult me 
  i insult you 
a man not fit to lick the ground
my mother walks on 
  you dog  questioning your queen 
  shame 
i ve nothing to be ashamed of 
you arrogant brat 
i ll marry the girl if i want 
and i ll have as many sons as i want 
there s nothing you
or your harpy mother can do 
why  drunken man  must you think   
   everything i do and say
comes from my mother 
because i know her heart  by hera   
   and i see her in your eyes 
you covet this throne too much 
we all know that she wolf
of a mother of yours wants me dead 
well  you can both dream  boy 
philip  this is the wine talking 
leave the boy  it ll wait 
now 
i command you 
apologize to your kinsman 
apologize 
no kinsman to me 
good night  old man 
and when my mother remarries 
i ll invite you to her wedding 
you bastard 
you ll obey me  come here 
and this is the man who is going
to take you from greece to persia 
he can t even make it
from one couch to the next 
get out of my palace 
you re exiled  you bastard 
banished from the land 
you re not welcome here 
you re no son of mine 
everything suddenly changed for him 
his father  king philip  was murdered 
and alexander  at 20   
   became the new ruler of macedonia 
and breaking their treaties with us 
dismissing alexander as an untried boy   
   several greek city states
rose up in revolt   
   much to persia s delight
and perhaps sponsored by their gold 
truly  alexander could love like no other 
but to betray him was to rouse
a vast and frightening anger 
and he massacred several thousand
men of that tragic city  thebes   
   and sold the survivors into slavery 
this  as intended 
stunned and defeated the greeks 
and though  in the end  he treated
most populations with magnanimity   
   it is these exceptions   
   thebes  gaza in syria and  later 
persepolis in persia and others   
   that are always remembered by those
who hate alexander and all he stood for 
at 21  alexander invaded asia
with an army of 40 000 trained men 
and liberating one city state
after the other   
   he conquered all of western asia
south to egypt   
   where he was declared pharaoh
of egypt  worshipped as a god 
it was in egypt that the
respected oracle at siwah   
   declared him the   
   true son of zeus 
he finally provoked
darius himself to battle   
   in the heart of the persian empire 
near babylon 
it was mad 
forty thousand of us
against 250 000 barbarians 
it was the day alexander
had waited for all his life 
alexander  son of a god 
it was a myth  of course 
at least it started as a myth 
i know 
i was there 
i saw his eyes 
there 
in the crack of the persian line 
we ll go for the head 
kill darius 
the gods have brought him
to us at last 
if i die  it s one macedonian 
but the persians  they cannot move
without darius  command 
here 
right here  we cut the throat
of the persian army 
this is madness  you ll never get
within 100 paces of him 
have you seen the sheer size
of his force 
not if you hold them on the left 
my brave parmenion   
   with your son philotas 
for just one  two hours tomorrow 
and you  unbreakable antigonus 
the center phalanx 
perdiccas 
leonnatus 
nearchus 
polyperchon 
if you pin them on the walls
of your sarissas here  in the center   
   their cavalry will follow me
out to the right 
and when bold cassander breaks   
   stretching their left  a hole will open 
then i and my cavalry   
   our revered cleitus 
ptolemy and hephaistion   
   will strike through that gap   
   and deal the deathblow
to darius  head 
alexander  even with luck  timing 
the gods  we must rout them tomorrow 
destroy their army completely 
or we ll be picked apart by bandit tribes
on the long journey home 
right 
you speak of home 
and retreat 
but do you understand  parmenion   
   babylon s my new home 
alexander   
   if we must fight   
   do so with stealth 
use your numbers well  we should attack
tonight when they least expect us 
i didn t cross asia
to steal this victory  cassander 
no  you are too honorable for that 
no doubt influenced from sleeping
with tales of troy under your pillow 
but your father
was no lover of homer s 
the lands west
of the euphrates  alexander   
   the hand of his daughter in marriage 
when has a greek been given such honors 
these are not honors 
parmenion  they re bribes   
   which the greeks
have accepted too long 
do you forget the man who murdered
my father lies across the valley 
alexander  we re still not sure if it was
persian gold behind the assassination 
  that is no matter 
  parmenion  you know that s not true 
your father taught you never to surrender
your reason to your passion 
now i urge you  regroup 
fall back to the coast 
raise a larger force 
i would  if i were parmenion 
but i am alexander 
and no more than earth has two suns
will asia bear two kings 
these are my terms 
and if darius isn t a coward
who hides behind his men   
   then he ll come to me tomorrow 
and when he bows down to greece   
   alexander will be merciful 
by ares  chains  he s got balls  men 
i mean  give the man his due 
parmenion 
and  lads  feast tonight 
for tomorrow we will dine in hades 
to whom do you pray 
phobos 
fear 
a bad omen 
more so for darius 
i ve come to believe that fear
of death drives all men  hephaistion 
this we didn t learn as schoolboys 
it is the cause of all our misfortunes 
  so  mighty crateros 
  your majesty 
  are you ready for tomorrow s dawn 
  it s been too long coming 
  the men are skittish as colts 
  good 
fear makes men fight better 
post your sentries alertly
but rest them well 
don t worry  general  i m known to sleep
with my eyes open as a baby s arse 
only because someone
might steal his loot  sire 
after tomorrow  even the thrifty
among you shall be kings 
the gods are with us  your majesty 
you ll stain the ground with persian blood 
i ve always believed  alexander 
but this seems so much bigger than us 
did patroclus doubt achilles when
they stood side by side at the siege of troy 
patroclus died first 
if you do   
if you were to fall  hephaistion 
even if macedonia were to lose a king   
   i will avenge you   
   and follow you down
to the house of death 
i would do the same 
on the eve of battle 
it s hardest to be alone 
then perhaps   
perhaps this is farewell   
   my alexander 
fear not  hephaistion 
we are at the beginning 
blood makes the world rise 
blood makes the rain fall 
blood makes the earth grow 
and in blood  all men are born and die 
blood is the food of the gods below 
come  bucephalus 
today we ride to our destiny 
company  group  regroup 
phalanx  turn right 
phalanx  attention 
neoptolemus 
i remember you the day
you took the siege tower at tire 
you were a giant 
and today  how will you fight 
dexippos  by athena 
how far was it you threw your man
wrestling at the last olympic games 
will you match it with your spear 
and timander  son of menander 
a great soldier to my father 
i still mourn your brother  addaios 
who died so bravely at halicarnassus 
what an honored family
you descend from  timander 
you fight for them today 
you ve all honored
your country and your ancestors 
and now we come to this
most distant place in asia   
   where across from us  darius
has at last gathered a vast army   
but ask yourselves  who is this great king
who pays assassins in gold coins   
   to murder my father  our king   
   in a most despicable
and cowardly manner 
who is this great king  darius 
who enslaves his own men to fight 
who is this king but a king of air 
these men do not fight for their homes 
they fight because
this king tells them they must 
and when they fight 
they will melt away like the air   
   because they know no loyalty
to a king of slaves 
but we are not here today as slaves 
we are here today   
   as macedonian freemen 
some of you   
   perhaps myself   
   will not live to see the sun set
over these mountains today 
but i say to you   
   what every warrior has known
since the beginning of time 
conquer your fear   
   and i promise you 
you will conquer death 
when they ask why you fought
so bravely  you will answer 
 i was here this day at gaugamela   
   for the freedom   
   and glory   
   of greece  
zeus be with us 
cassander  four columns  go 
where does he go 
i don t know  majesty 
envelop him  bessus 
hephaistion  go 
phalanx 
he makes a mistake  pharnakes 
yes  great king 
be brave  men 
steady on the left  lads 
bend if you must  but never break 
and keep watching the cavalry on the left 
pick up the pace 
prepare to repel chariots 
cassander 
forward  men 
  left turn 
  infantry  clear  out now 
hold your positions 
hold your positions 
we must fall back to the gully  father 
no  hold 
where is he  we re far too thin 
get word to alexander 
  move 
  yes  sir 
come  macedonians  ride  ride 
  shields  break off 
  break off 
the shields are here 
drive for the hole 
  drive for the hole 
  drive for the hole 
back and to the left 
back and to the left 
  philotas  philotas 
  father 
go  tell alexander yourself 
and if he won t listen  then survive me
and avenge this betrayal 
pay attention  lad 
your father still watches over you 
darius 
find your horses 
darius 
go  go 
we can reach those mountains by sunset 
go all night and catch darius at dawn 
provision the horses 
alexander 
alexander  my father s lost 
they ve overrun the flank 
they re into the baggage train 
parmenion s crumbling 
alexander  if you chase him 
you risk losing your army here 
and if we capture him 
we gain an empire 
you can run to the ends of the earth 
you coward   
   but you ll never run far enough 
to parmenion 
you bleed free  my lord 
  may i tend to your wound 
  no  hermolaus  not now 
there s far worse than me  go to them 
help them 
  your majesty 
  you re very brave 
what shall i call you 
  glaukos  my king 
  glaukos 
  and where s your home 
  illyria 
let your body go loose 
think of home now 
be brave again  glaukos   
   and you will live on in glory 
alexander 
the persian empire 
the greatest the world had yet known   
   was destroyed 
and alexander  at 25 
was now king of all 
alexander once said to me 
 we are most alone
when we are with the myths  
phalanx 
and thus  it came to pass in a dream   
   as mythical to all greeks
as achilles defeating the trojans 
at this one glorious moment in time   
   alexander was loved by all 
but in the end  i believe babylon
was a far easier mistress to enter   
   than she was to leave 
sikander  sikander 
imagine the minds that conceived this 
with architects and engineers like these   
   we could build cities
as we ve only dreamed 
aristotle may have called them barbarians 
but he never saw babylon 
we have enough gold here to support
three generations of macedonian armies 
and macedonia would soon corrupt 
cassander 
wealth in great quantities brings the crows 
not for the men who fought  i trust 
we ll pay them well  antigonus 
but not as mercenaries for future services 
now you sound like philip 
philip never saw babylon 
no  he didn t  hephaistion 
  hello 
  hello 
alexander  i know you think me
a stiff old sod   
   but whatever our differences 
know this day   
   your father would be very proud of you 
thank you  parmenion 
i ask you to forgive me
my own anger  my pride 
they  too  blind me 
yes  the grandsons of goat herders   
   we now rule 2 million square miles 
not if you keep giving it all away 
none of you fear that this great fortune
may drive us all to destruction 
you overvalue us 
for as long as darius breathes 
he is the legitimate king of asia   
   and i but the king of air 
but he has no power  alexander 
he s lost in the mountains with no army 
as long as he s lost  philotas 
he can be believed in 
only when he s found will it be decided 
it seems you ve already
made up your mind 
we must finish what we failed
to do at gaugamela 
we must hunt darius down to 
  that was not your father s mission 
  and i am not my father 
come on  have you so quickly forgotten 
fortune favors the bold 
by the gods  what is this 
no wonder darius fled
when he had this to come back to 
i venture one for every night of the year 
help me  aphrodite 
how will i go back to lysimache
after this 
i advise you not to touch  leonnatus 
here  i ll take care of it for you 
apologies 
aristotle was perhaps prescient 
do these images fool us with their beauty
and degrade our souls 
great king alexander 
the princess of the thousand roses   
   and eldest daughter of the formerly
great king darius   
   stateira 
noble alexander   
   i come to beg for the lives   
   of my sisters   
   my mother  my grandmother 
you are not wrong  princess stateira 
he  too  is alexander 
please 
i plead for my family s lives 
  sell me as a slave  great king  but   
  look now   
   in my eyes   
   princess   
   and tell me   
   how would you like to be treated 
as i am   
   a princess 
then so be it 
you and your family shall
be treated as my family 
you shall live in this palace
as long as you choose 
have you any other requests for me 
my noble princess 
no 
everything i wish   
   i have   
requested 
requested 
you truly are   
   a queen 
yes  she would be
a perfect match for you   
   but you do nothing 
three months you ve been in babylon
and leave me in pella   
   at the mercy of your enemies 
of which you have many 
antipater  accustomed now to the power
that you have given him 
i must watch him grow stronger 
i m certain that he communicates secretly
with parmenion  who is dangerous 
but beware  most of all 
of those closest to you 
they are like snakes   
   and can be turned 
general crateros 
cassander is antipater s son 
even cleitus  your father s favorite   
   and ptolemy  your friend  yes 
but beware of men who think too much 
they blind themselves 
only hephaistion do i leave out 
but all of them you make rich   
   while your mother and yourself 
you leave in generous poverty 
why won t you ever believe me 
it is only a dark mind like mine
that can know these secrets of the heart 
for they are dark  alexander 
so dark 
but in you   
   the son of zeus 
lies the light of the world 
your companions will be shadows
in the underworld   
   when you are a name living forever
in history as the most glorious   
   shining light of youth  forever young 
forever inspiring 
never will there be an alexander like you 
alexander the great 
remember  bring me to babylon
as you promised 
i can only help you  for they know
if they harm you   
   they will face my wrath 
as queen of babylon 
it s a high ransom she charges
for nine months  lodging in the womb 
bring her  alexander 
  it ll give her such joy 
  joy 
when i m the cracked mirror
of her dreams 
stay with me tonight  hephaistion 
i ll take my own bath 
thank you  bagoas 
the generals question your obsession
with darius 
they say it was never meant
for you to be king of asia 
naturally 
they want only to return to their homes 
rich with gold  but i ve seen the future 
i ve seen it now 1000 times 
on 1000 faces 
these people want   
need change 
aristotle was wrong about them 
how so 
look at those we ve conquered 
they leave their dead unburied 
they smash their enemies  skulls
and drink them as dust 
they mate in public 
what can they think or sing or write
when none can read 
but as alexander s army  they can go
where they never thought possible 
they can soldier or work in the cities 
the alexandrias 
from egypt to the outer ocean 
we could connect these lands 
hephaistion   
   and the people 
some say these alexandrias have become
extensions of alexander himself 
they draw people into the cities
to make slaves of them 
but we freed them  hephaistion  from
the persia where everyone lived as slaves 
to free the people of the world   
   such would be beyond the glory
of achilles  beyond herakles   
   a feat to rival prometheus   
   who was always a friend to man 
remember the fates of these heroes 
  they suffered greatly 
  we all suffer 
your father  mine 
they all came to the end of their time 
and in the end  when it s over 
all that matters is what you ve done 
you once said 
 the fear of death drives all men  
are there no other forces 
is there not love in your life   
   alexander 
i wonder sometimes if it s not
your mother you run from 
so many years 
so many miles between you 
what is it you fear 
who knows these things 
when i was a child  my mother thought
me divine  my father  weak 
which am i  hephaistion 
weak or divine 
all i know is   
   i trust only you in this world 
i ve missed you 
i need you 
it is you i love  hephaistion 
no other 
you still hold your head cocked 
  like that 
  i ve stopped that 
like a deer  listening in the wind 
you strike me still  alexander 
and you have eyes like no other 
i sound as stupid as a schoolboy  but   
   you re everything i care for   
   and by the sweet breath of aphrodite   
   i m so jealous of losing you
to this world you want 
you ll never lose me  hephaistion 
i ll be with you always 
till the end 
the campaign in the northeast of persia   
   turned into a hard guerrilla war
of almost three years 
we chased darius towards bactria
but missed taking him by hours 
he was dying when we found him  sire 
he asked for water 
he drank and died 
the great king darius had been betrayed
by his own commanders 
fully honoring his corpse   
   alexander hunted down
these commanders into unknown lands   
   crossing even beyond
the river oxus into sogdia 
we fought them as far as
the unknown steppes of scythia   
   where only legendary heroes
had once trod 
the surveyors told us we were now on
the borders of where europe and asia meet 
in fact  we were totally lost 
here  alexander founded
his 10th alexandria   
   and settled it with veterans  their women
and any who would dare the frontier life 
unable to accept defeat in any form   
   alexander persisted in breaking
every tribe that resisted   
   until the day he received the head
of his last enemy in surrender 
for alexander  there could be
no pretender to the throne of asia   
   which now included all
of sogdia and bactria 
it was here that alexander made
one of his most mysterious decisions 
her eyes tell me
she cares for you  alexander 
perhaps too much 
in the ways of my country   
   those who love too much
lose everything   
   and those who love with irony   
   last 
your father must be turning in his grave 
after all this  a hill chief s daughter 
by athena s justice  this girl has spirit 
but what s the point  alexander 
just take her as your concubine 
because i want a son 
damn you  philotas 
then half your nobles have sisters
who d make fine macedonian mothers 
to take an asian as my queen 
not a captive  is a sign of deep respect 
it will bring us together  unify us 
which is not to say i won t take
a macedonian 
  as a second wife  you insult macedonia 
  alexander 
this is about the honor of our kingdom 
exactly  what can be won  alexander 
we re in asia to punish them
for their crimes  we ve achieved that 
seven years from home  now we drift
from one far region to another   
   chasing nomads and bandits
when macedonia bleeds its manpower 
for what  to build roads in asia 
to give these people cities 
to found cities and expand
our reach is not to drift 
  what benefit to macedon 
  it s far richer 
  look what you give them 
  with respect   
   had you fought better at gaugamela
when your flank was crumbling   
  how dare you  nearchus  
  general nearchus to you  boy 
alexander spread our flank too thin 
there was nothing my father   
   or any of you could ve done 
  philotas 
alexander  i ve known you
since you were born 
i supported you at your father s death 
at the very least  for zeus  sake   
   and in respect to the council
that chose you king   
   give us a macedonian heir 
a macedonian heir 
  you ve been heard clearly 
  but   
parmenion  after the wedding  take two
brigades to babylon  where i look to you   
   and antipater in greece  to maintain
our empire and supply this expedition 
i ll winter with my army at marakand 
i pray to apollo you realize how far
you ve turned from your father s path 
damn you  parmenion 
by the gods and your apollo 
what was in my father s guts
wasn t overripe in reason like yours 
he never lusted for war  alexander 
or enjoyed it so 
he consulted his peers in council 
among equals  the macedonian way 
he didn t decide based
on his personal desires 
i ve taken us further
than my father ever dreamed 
old man   
   we re in new worlds 
alexander  be reasonable 
were they ever meant to be our equals 
share our rewards 
you remember what aristotle said 
an asian 
what would a vow mean to a race
that s never kept their word to a greek 
  aristotle be damned 
  alexander 
by zeus and all the gods   
   what makes you so much better
than them  cassander 
better than you really are 
in you and those like you is this 
alexander 
what disturbs me most is not your lack
of respect for my judgment 
it s your contempt for a world
far older than ours 
and so 10 years after his mother s
insistence he marry a macedonian   
through our union   
   greek and barbarian   
   the most powerful man in the world
took a girl of no political significance 
why 
some say it was for alliance
with the tribes 
others  the desire for a successor 
and yet others said alexander
truly fell in love 
who roxane really was   
   i doubt any of us ever saw further
than the pools of those black eyes 
alexander   
   special for you 
on this glorious occasion   
   i toast this great army
that has given so much 
and in honor of them  those of you
who set out with us seven long years ago   
   i pronounce all your debts paid forthwith
from the royal treasury 
praise alexander 
and in honor of my bride   
   my beautiful bride   
   we recognize the many women
who ve shared the long road with us   
   and grant them dowries
befitting a proper marriage 
and what about our boys 
and lastly   
   lastly  the gods demand no less of us   
   that your children be given
a proper greek education   
   and military training
under our protection   
   so as to be the new soldiers
of our kingdom   
   in asia 
i found it in egypt 
the man who sold it said it came
from a time   
   when man worshipped sun and stars 
i ll always think of you   
   as the sun  alexander 
and i pray your dream
will shine on all men 
i wish you a son 
you re a great man 
many will love you  alexander 
but none so pure and deep   
you   
   love him 
he is hephaistion 
there are many different ways
to love  roxane 
come 
no 
no  no 
you have no fear 
it s fitting 
a man searches for a woman
at earth s top   
   and finds her 
the myth becomes real 
great man 
sikander 
you  i kill now 
do it 
end it  i would do   
i would do the same 
i ll die a fool for this   
   love 
my life is now yours 
you will have my son 
who is this woman you call
your queen  alexander 
a hill girl 
you  with your breeding 
already she makes enemies
with her strong  clumsy nature 
do not confuse us 
i was never a barbarian as philip said 
we are of achilles  royal blood 
zeus is your father 
oh  i understand she brings
you some happiness   
   but hear me when i tell you   
   act and act soon 
after seven years  people wonder 
 who is this king alexander  
i have given you ample proof 
antipater daily undermines your authority 
return to babylon
and strengthen your center 
or come home to macedonia
and reorganize 
but do not chase your dream   
   further east 
your life and mine depend on it 
remember   
   my only thoughts are of you 
as you  too  must face
your glorious destiny 
think kindly of your mother 
provide for me 
protect me from your enemies
when you are gone 
and remember always   
   it is i who love you more than any 
if only you were not a pale reflection   
   of my mother s heart 
who did this 
  tell me 
  hermolaus 
never will you find a man
as devoted as i  yes 
the conspiracy deeply upset alexander   
   not only because it involved
the young pages   
   who d shared his dream   
   but  more intimately 
it implicated philotas   
   his companion from boyhood  who was
captain of alexander s royal guards 
alexander 
remember me for who i am 
i do remember you  philotas 
but not as you remember yourself 
it appears to me and your peers that
the true weather of your soul is ambition 
no 
  none of us defended philotas 
  i didn t do this 
then again  none of us ever liked him 
and  of course  his power
was carved up by the rest of us 
before he died  we tortured him to find out
what his father  parmenion  knew 
but this we never learned 
what to do with parmenion and his
20 000 troops guarding our supply lines   
   was a far more delicate matter 
was he innocent in this 
or had he decided to act   
   before age further withered his power 
they ll be divided 
  the men will follow their king 
  alexander won t be there 
necessity required alexander to act 
the infantry will follow me 
and he sealed the camp within the hour
of the first accusations against philotas 
then go  antigonus  and cleitus 
and go quickly 
three days  hard riding sent antigonus
and cleitus to parmenion 
his soldiers accepted the finding
of guilt against parmenion   
   as they understood that the head of
family is responsible for the behavior of all 
cleitus  antigonus 
parmenion 
i remember a remark of bagoas  once   
   that love eluded alexander as much 
if not more   
   than finding the end of the world 
in the spring  alexander marched
an army of 150 000   
   across the passes of the hindu kush   
   into the unknown 
in his dream  it was the promised route
to the end of the world 
we were now a mobile empire   
   stretching back thousands of miles
to greece 
cooks and architects 
doctors and surveyors   
   moneylenders and wives   
   children  lovers  whores 
and forget not the slaves   
   that anonymous  bent  working spine
of this new beast 
ravaged or expanded  for better or worse   
   no occupied territory
remained the same again 
although devoted to roxane   
   alexander s visits
to her tent diminished   
   as a year  then two  went by
without a successor   
   wounding alexander s great pride 
the surveyors are saying that zeus
chained prometheus up there 
in one of those caves 
they say there s a giant eagle s nest
just above it 
i suppose he drops down each night
to peck out poor prometheus  liver 
you remember what aristotle told us
of these mountains 
yes  i do 
that when we reach these heights   
   we d look back and see macedonia
to the west   
   and the outer ocean to the east 
but i fear this world is far larger
than anyone dreamed 
a world of titans 
the scouts have been up
every known trail  alexander 
there is no way across 
except to the south  into india 
were we gods  we d breach
these walls to the eastern ocean 
we will  alexander 
in a few years  time  we will return 
but first  the men must see their homes 
have you found your home   
   ptolemy 
more and more  i think
it will be alexandria 
well  at least it s hot 
and thais   
   she loved it there 
women bring men home 
  i have no such feeling 
  you have babylon  alexander 
where your mother awaits your invitation 
yes  i have babylon 
but each land  each boundary i cross   
   i strip away another illusion 
i sense death will be the last 
yet still i push harder and harder   
   to reach this home 
where has our eagle gone 
we must go on  ptolemy 
until we find an end 
india  the land where the sun was born   
   fabled to be even richer than persia   
   had never been explored or conquered 
from the beginning  alexander struggled
to unify a land without a center 
kings who conspired against one another 
a labyrinth of tribes urged on
by zealots and philosophers   
   to die by the thousands
for their strange gods 
crateros  in the advance party 
fought against men with hairy skins   
   who were tiny and lived
in the tops of trees 
until hephaistion convinced us
these were animals   
   who imitated men
but wore their own skin 
keep that away from me 
they called this tribe  monkey  
monkey 
  incredible 
  look at his hands 
look  roxane 
hello  little man 
  do they speak 
  no  but they do sing 
and then  there was the rain 
never before had we seen water
that fell from the gods   
   for 60 days and nights 
you know better  machatas 
what s your son going to say 
come on  man 
the older you get  the stronger 
right  my king 
give me my horse  alexander 
i ll be with you at your side 
watch out for the serpent 
hold it  hold it tight 
cleitus  bring the snake healers 
  pauvanus  someone bring pauvanus 
  where s the bite 
  what happened 
  it s to the neck 
oh  no  zeus  no 
hold on  hold on 
be brave 
be brave 
oh  zeus 
our quest for gold and glory evaporated
as we realized   
   there was none to be had 
tempers worsened 
we massacred all indians who resisted 
and with the local water putrid   
   we drank the strong wine 
as we moved southeast   
   alexander often returned the lands
we d conquered to their defeated kings   
   so as to make of them allies 
but this did not sit well with the army   
   who began to wonder if alexander
was on some crazed quest   
   to imitate the glory of herakles 
give him a kiss 
go on  kiss him 
give him a kiss 
  to bagoas 
  to bagoas 
  and to my mother s god  dionysus   
  dionysus 
   who  we re told by our indian allies 
traveled here before herakles   
   some 6000 years ago 
to a hero 
to a hero 
roxane 
you lose face 
these indians   
   they are a low  evil people 
you don t try to understand them 
i try 
but this i know  alexander 
in persia  you are a great king 
here   
   they hate you 
let us go back to babylon 
there  you are strong 
we ll talk about this later 
yes 
later 
talk 
i shall come 
tonight 
and i shall wait 
good night  my king 
your majesty 
i ll toast to bagoas 
and the 30 000 beautiful persian boys   
   we re training to fight
in this great army 
and to the memory of philip 
had he lived to see his macedonians   
   transformed into such   
   a pretty army 
to philip 
to a real hero 
philip 
and to cleitus and his new appointment
as satrap of bactria 
cleitus 
that s a fancy way of putting it  ptolemy 
but we all know what a pension
and an exile is   
   after 30 years  service 
you call governing
this major province exile 
has your majesty given any
of his closest companions   
   a province so far from home 
then you won t make a very
good satrap  will you  cleitus 
so be it 
let me rot in macedonian rags   
   rather than shine   
   in eastern pomp 
i won t quake and bow down
like the sycophants you have around you 
hephaistion  nearchus  perdiccas 
as governor of one
of our most asian of satrapies   
   cleitus  does it not occur to you
that if my persian subjects   
   bow down before me 
it s important for them to do so 
do i insist on greeks doing the same 
you accept greek offerings
as a son of zeus  do you not 
only when offered 
why don t you refuse
these vain flatteries 
what freedom is this  to bow before you 
you bow before herakles 
and he was mortal   
   but a son of zeus 
how can you  so young 
compare yourself to herakles 
why not 
i ve achieved more in my years 
traveled as far 
probably farther 
herakles did it by himself 
did you conquer asia
by yourself  alexander 
who planned the asian invasion 
was it not your father 
or is his blood no longer good enough 
  zeus amon  is it 
  you insult me  cleitus 
you mock my family  be careful 
never would your father have taken
barbarians as his friends   
   asked us to fight with them
as equals in war 
are we not good enough any longer 
i remember a time   
   when we could talk as men 
straight to the eye 
none of this scraping  groveling 
now you kiss them 
take a barbarian  childless wife
and dare call her queen 
go quickly  cleitus 
before you ruin your life 
doesn t your great pride
fear the gods any longer 
this army   
this army is your blood  boy 
without it  you re nothing 
you no longer serve the purpose
of this march 
  get him from my sight 
  i don t serve your purpose  
what was i serving when i saved
your puppy life at gaugamela 
do you think we d be forced now
to mate with brown apes 
alexander 
turn out the guards 
arrest him for treason 
  who s with him 
  no 
who s with him 
i call father zeus to witness 
i call you to trial before him 
and we ll see how deep
this conspiracy cuts 
  take him 
  you speak of plots against you 
what about poor parmenion 
you made me do your foul deed 
have you no shame 
hypocrite  despot  false king 
you and your barbarian mother
live in shame 
cleitus 
oh  my cleitus 
  let me pass 
  none can enter 
i am the queen 
i want to see him  i ve waited three days 
he says none  not even you 
  he needs me 
  no  he doesn t 
and he needs you 
hephaistion  you make a mistake 
the army needs your reassurance 
alexander 
yes 
like an old lover they forgive 
but they will never forget 
you know more than any   
   great deeds are done by men
who took and never regretted 
you re alexander 
pity and grief will only destroy you 
have i become so arrogant
that i am blind 
sometimes   
   to expect the best of everyone   
   is arrogance 
then cleitus spoke true 
i am become a tyrant 
you re mortal 
and they know it 
and they forgive you because
you make them proud of themselves 
i ve failed   
   utterly 
philip  king of macedonia   
   and leader of the greeks 
all my life  i ve waited to see greeks
grovel with respect for macedonia 
today is that day 
they say already 
 philip was a great general   
   but alexander is simply great  
but if you ever insult me again   
   i ll kill you 
i ve missed you 
in the spring  persia 
you ll command my horse from the right 
i m honored  father  i wouldn t miss it   
   for all the gold in the world 
which  one day  you ll have 
making himself a 13th god 
he s drunk so much wine  my poor philip 
he s lost his mind 
  your majesty 
  attalus

is enjoying the spectacle   
   as much as our regent 
he s very tired 
hey 
  pausanias  bring the rest of the guard 
  royal guard 
to the arena  march

  greeks all over the place 
  cleitus  cleitus

he ll guard your back for you 
yes  father

how i can walk through my people 
then let them call me tyrant 
bring the main guard in
after my entry only 
cleitus  make sure the wine

i want them to like me 
weren t you told  i go in alone

  father  it s best i go with you 
you want the world to see
you re my successor 
is that what she wants 
don t look so hurt all the time 
alexander  be a man 
you count yourself lucky you were here
at all today  after your public display 
by herakles  by zeus  by all the gods   
   obey me this once 
have courage  father 
and go on your way
rejoicing that at each step   
   you may recall your valor 
and now  our beloved king philip   
   in whose honor
these wedding games begin 
pausanias  i told you   
the king is slain 
the king lives 
alexander  son of philip 
may the gods bless the king 
you re king now  you re king 
may the gods bless alexander 
  alexander 
  alexander 
get out 
go 
how can you behave
so shamelessly in public 
because it was meant to be 
this isn t how i wanted to become king 
  no one blames you 
  they blame me behind my back  in secret 
  slander is not power 
  shame is 
who killed my father 
tell me 
tell me  or shall i put you on trial
for his murder 
  pausanias 
  he had help 
did you help him 
no  never 
why  why would i 
so many wanted it 
greeks  persians  men   
you re mad  you re cursed 
you ve unleashed furies 
you don t know their power 
now who is exaggerating 
even if it was the wish of your heart   
that s a lie  he was my father 
i loved him 
he was not your father 
you owe no blood debt to that man 
you lie and lie and lie 
so many lies you ve spun
like a sorceress  confusing me 
look at you  look at you 
you are everything that he was not 
he was coarse  you are refined 
he was a general  and you are a king 
he could not rule himself   
   and you shall rule the world 
you re so cursed by all the gods
when you speak like this 
such thick pride   
   and no mourning for your husband 
mourn   
   him 
what do you know of philip 
no  alexander  zeus is your father 
  act like it 
  my first act would be to kill you 
you murdered me in my cradle 
you birthed me in a sack of hate 
hate you have for those
stronger than you 
  hate you have for men 
  i taught you my heart  alexander 
and by zeus and dionysus 
you grew beautiful 
damn your sorceress soul 
your soul is mine  alexander 
no  no 
you ve taken from me everything
i ve ever loved and made me you 
stop it  stop acting like a boy 
you re a king  act like one 
parmenion is with us  for once 
execute attalus without delay 
confiscate their lands and root out
that family forever 
eurydice  never 
laugh  you monster 
you heartbreaker 
how will you live out the year like this 
  have you learned nothing from philip 
  no  from you  mother 
the best 
what have i done
to make you hate me so 
one day  you will understand this 
but i have only you in my heart 
i know what you need 
now is the time 
the gods favor you 
great wealth  power  conquest 
all you desire 
the world is yours 
take it 
take it 
he never saw his mother again 
and while he was away 
fighting the northern tribes   
   olympias had philip s new wife 
eurydice  and her infant son murdered 
by necessity   
   he had her uncle attalus executed 
of course you have fears 
we all have fears   
   because no one has ever
gone this far before 
and now we are weeks from
the encircling ocean  our route home 
we ll build a fleet of ships   
   and sail all the way
back down the nile to egypt 
and from alexandria 
we shall be home within weeks 
there to be reunited with our loved ones 
to share our great treasures
and tales of asia 
and to enjoy our imperishable glory
to the ends of time 
  follow alexander 
  i ll follow you 
what 
  silence 
  we re with you  alexander 
peucestas 
a hero 
where are the amazons of myth
who dare to fight and kill men 
where have they gone 
we ll never leave you  alexander 
you  meleager 
who are these tribes ahead
compared to those we ve vanquished 
lysimachus 
antigonus 
you break my heart  you men 
afraid 
crateros 
crateros 
and another one 
crateros 
crateros 
my king 
i don t like no bellyaching 
i won t tolerate it in any of my units 
i lost many a man 
young ones  never been with a woman 
some died of disease 
some were butchered in scythia
by the banks of the oxus 
some died good 
some just didn t get no luck 
but they died 
forty thousand i come over with
eight years ago 
and we march after you
more than 10 000 miles 
in the rain and the sun 
we fought for you 
some of us  50 battles we ve been in 
we killed many a barbarian 
and now when i look around 
how many of them faces do i see 
now you want us to fight more
of these crazy monkey tribes east of here 
we hear talk of thousands
of these elephant monsters   
   cross a hundred more rivers 
crateros  good crateros 
who better than you to speak 
most noble of men 
but you know there s no part of me
without a scar or a bone broken 
by sword  knife  stone  catapult and club 
i ve shared every hardship with all of you 
you have  my king 
and we love you for it 
but  by zeus  too many have died 
you have no children  alexander 
and we re just   
   humble men  we seek no disturbance
with the gods  all we wish for   
   is to see our children and our wives
and our grandchildren one last time   
   before we join our brothers
in that dark house they call hades 
yes  you re right  crateros 
i have been negligent 
i should ve sent you
veterans home sooner  and i will 
the first of you
shall be the silver shields 
then every man who s served seven years 
with full pensions from our treasury 
and respected  rich  loved 
you ll be treated by your wives and children
as heroes for the rest of your lives   
   and enjoy a peaceful death 
but you dream  crateros 
your simplicity long ended when
you took persian mistresses and children   
   and you thickened your holdings
with plunder and jewels 
because you ve fallen in love
with all the things in life that destroy men 
do you not see 
and you  as well as i  know   
   that as the years decline
and the memories stale   
   and all your great victories fade   
   it will always be remembered 
you left your king in asia 
for i will go on  with my asians 
  to the jackals with you  then  alexander 
  we come for you  and you discard us 
  shame 
  we want to go home  alexander 
we re tired of glory 
we want to see our wives
and children before we die 
i ve got children i haven t even seen 
i want to see my children 
i paid for your bastard children 
i ve taken nothing for myself 
and all i ve asked of you
is one more month 
  shame 
  that s your king 
what would your father say 
i ve taken you further
than my father ever dreamed 
so go home  i look to the
barbarians for their courage 
i go east 
he wants us dead
so we can t speak of his crimes 
  who said that 
  we won t make it to macedonia 
you despicable coward  come forth 
  make your accusations public 
  so you can have us killed 
  son of zeus 
  you desecrate your real father s memory 
  or did you murder him like you did cleitus 
  hide in this mob because i ll take your life 
you men insult my honor  my paternity 
arrest him 
and him  yes 
and you  this loudmouth demetrius 
you call me murderer 
i have no such blood on my hands 
and him 
yes  you ll know the pain of treason 
you mock my shame for cleitus and say
i d harm a hair of my father s head 
arrest him 
after all i ve done for you  you swine 
you cowards  traitors 
come on  then 
where are your daggers 
he drove on  south to the outer ocean 
in smashing the mutiny
and executing the ringleaders   
   he did nothing  to my mind  that any
general in wartime would not have done 
but clearly  the army was divided 
and alexander was no longer
loved by all 
stay calm 
together we are strong as gods 
cover with your left 
strike hard with your right 
fear is rot  a waste of time 
lock shields 
battle positions 
move 
choppers  prepare your knives 
follow me 
strike hard  boys  strike hard 
come  macedonians 
why do you hang back  hurry 
cavalry 
split to thirds  regroup and encircle 
  oh  no  cavalry on me 
  follow alexander 
charge  charge  charge 
the phalanx is in jeopardy 
meleager  ride to pharnakes
and tell him return to the center 
find hephaistion at the riverbank
and bring all cavalry to the center 
we must reach crateros
before it s too late 
hephaistion  to the center 
come  macedonians  ride 
ride 
coenus  get out of there 
no 
  the horses won t go 
  on foot  then 
fall back  men  fall back 
come  bucephalus 
 tis only sun and shadow 
you and i together 
one last time  bucephalus 
isn t it a lovely thing
to live with great courage   
   and to die leaving an everlasting fame 
come  macedonians 
why do you retreat 
do you want to live forever 
in the name of zeus  attack 
attack 
alexander 
alexander 
  the king is down 
  to the king 
it was the bloodiest of his battles 
pure butchery  the end of all reason 
we d never be men again 
he lives  alexander 
men of macedon   
   we re going home 
  what 
  what 
  we re going home 
  home 
we re going 
we re going home 
his life should have ended in india   
   but that s myth 
in life  herakles died of a poisoned shirt 
given him in error by his jealous wife 
making his devotions to the gods
at the end of the great journey   
   alexander bade the east farewell
and marched his army directly west   
   across the great gedrosian desert   
   seeking the shortest route home
to babylon 
to this day  there is no accounting
of how many died 
it was the worst blunder of his life 
and when he finally reentered babylon 
after six years in the far east   
   alexander again seized the imagination
of the world by taking two more wives 
  just last night he was   
  it s the water  your majesty 
he mixed it with the wine 
but how can this be 
  typhus of india 
  i wouldn t tax yourself  your majesty 
a few good nights  rest will do it 
but no wine or cold   
come  doctor 
i feel better 
soon  i ll be up 
we leave for arabia in the spring 
and i couldn t leave without you 
arabia 
you used to dress me up like a sheik   
   wave your wooden scimitar 
you were the only one
who d never let me win 
the only one who s ever been
honest with me 
you saved me from myself 
please don t leave me  hephaistion 
my alexander 
i remember the young man who wanted
to be achilles and then outdid him 
and you  patroclus 
and then what happened 
ours is a myth only young men believe 
  but how beautiful a myth it was 
  we reach  we fall 
oh  hephaistion 
  i worry for you without me 
  i am nothing without you 
come  fight  hephaistion 
we will die together 
it s our destiny 
we ll have children with our wives  and
our sons will play together as we once did 
a thousand ships
we ll launch from here  hephaistion 
we ll round arabia
and sail up the gulf to egypt 
from there  we ll build a channel through
the desert and out to the middle sea 
and then we ll move on carthage  and that
great island  sicily  they ll pay large tribute 
after that  the roman tribe 
good fighters  we ll beat them 
and then explore the northern forests   
   and out the pillars of herakles
to the western ocean 
and then one day 
not 10 years from now   
   babylon  with its deep water harbor 
will be the center of the world 
alexandrias will grow 
populations will mix and travel freely 
asia and europe will come together 
and we ll grow old  hephaistion   
   looking out our balcony
at this new world 
hephaistion 
hephaistion 
  where is this doctor 
  i can t explain this  your majesty 
  it s not possible  i swear by apollo 
  execute him 
take him out now and execute him 
  come away  come away 
  liars  liars  you all hated him  all of you 
get out  get out now 
be gone 
be gone with you 
harpies  get out  get out 
are you drunk again 
  get out 
  he s dead 
  who 
  many hated him   
   but i don t think any other
would have dared 
hephaistion is dead 
are you mad 
you monster 
  are you mad 
  you ve taken from me all i ve ever loved 
may all the furies through time
damn your miserable heart  obey me 
alexander 
i have your child  alexander 
  alexander  we have a son 
  no 
  the child 
  oh  your majesty  no 
alexander  i have your child 
alexander  my husband  my king 
we have a son 
my poor  poor  ill fated son 
never touch me again 
no 
one last toast 
before the dawn 
to my old friends 
  and to the myths 
  to the myths 
drink it down  alexander 
drink it down 
yes  come on  finish it 
to the next dawn 
yes  come 
come to babylon  i await you 
your only loving son 
wait  wait 
vultures  wait 
your son  alexander 
just three more months 
please live  alexander 
alexander  we beg you  tell us who 
who will rule this great empire
if you leave us 
  fear not  we re at the beginning 
  you re a great man 
the myth becomes real 
beyond herakles 
when it s over  all that matters is
what you ve done  i ll remember 
zeus is your father 
alexander  the army will divide 
satrapies will revolt 
without orders  there ll be war 
who will it be 
pray tell us  who 
  what did he say 
   to the best  
  he said   to the best  
  what 
  no  he said   to crateros  
  to crateros 
why would he say crateros 
on the 10th of june 
a month short of his 33rd year   
   alexander s great heart
finally gave out 
and as he vowed 
he joined hephaistion 
but in his short life 
he achieved  without doubt   
   the mythic glory
of his ancestor achilles and more 
his sacrifice was an early death   
   but in keeping
to his side of the bargain   
   i cannot help but feel
he conquered death as well 
olympias  transgression
in the murder of his father   
   is  to my mind  a probability 
his  a burden 
alexander was too in love with glory
for him to steal it 
but by blood  and blood alone 
he was guilty 
no 
  the body stays in babylon 
  within hours   
   we were fighting like jackals
for his corpse 
the wars of the world had begun 
forty years  off and on  they endured 
cassander in greece 
crateros and antigonus in western asia 
solucas and perdiccas in the east 
myself in egypt 
  until we divided his empire in four parts 
  gentlemen  we are not savages 
cassander certainly proved
his will to power   
   when seven years later 
he had olympias executed 
and within 12 years  he achieved   
   the complete destruction
of alexander s bloodline   
   when he poisoned roxane   
   and alexander s 13 year old son 
the true heir to the empire 
but the truth is never simple   
   and yet it is 
the truth is  we did kill him 
by silence  we consented 
because   
because we couldn t go on 
what  by ares  did we look forward to
but to be discarded in the end  like cleitus 
after all this time  to give away our wealth
to asian sycophants we despised 
mixing the races  harmony 
oh  he talked of these things   
   but wasn t it really about alexander
and another population ready to obey him 
i never believed in his dream 
none of us did 
that s the truth of his life 
the dreamers exhaust us 
they must die before they kill us
with their blasted dreams 
oh  just throw all that away  cadmos 
it s an old fool s rubbish 
you shall write   he died of fever
and a weakened condition  
yes  great pharaoh 
oh  he could ve stayed home in macedonia 
married  raised a family 
he d have died a celebrated man 
but this was not alexander 
all his life 
he fought to free himself from fear 
and by this  and this alone 
he was made free 
the freest man i ve ever known 
his tragedy was one
of increasing loneliness   
   and impatience with those
who could not understand 
and if his desire   
   to reconcile greek and barbarian
ended in failure   
what failure 
his failure towered
over other men s successes 
i ve lived   
i ve lived long life  cadmos   
   but the glory
and the memory of man   
   will always belong to the ones
