alexander hunted commanders unknown lands
crossing even beyond river oxus sogdia
fought far unknown steppes scythia
legendary heroes trod
surveyors told us borders europe asia meet
fact totally lost
alexander founded th alexandria
settled veterans women would dare frontier life
unable accept defeat form
alexander persisted breaking every tribe resisted
