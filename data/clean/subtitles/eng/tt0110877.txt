  the poet  pabio neruda  in rome   
centrai station 
a group of rowdy peopie
has inconvenienced the travellers   
who crowd the station piatforms
every day 
these protesters   
are not drunkards   
nor the usuai hotheads
who protest just for the fun of it 
they are a group of intellectuais 
writers and journallsts 
why have they joined
together  shouting   
disturbing the pollce
and carabinieri 
the mystery is reveaied
when the train arrives 
pabio neruda gets out
at rome station   
the chllean poet known throughout
the worid for his poetry   
and his communist ideas which
have often got him into troubie   
and for which
he has now been exlled 
the poet appears to be
well ioved in itaiy   
and  judging by the enthusiastic
embrace of this woman   
not oniy for his morai gifts 
women go crazy for his poetry   
maybe because neruda
writes iove poems   
a topic which appeais
to the femaie sensibllity 
but iet s go back
to our noisy crowd 
the home office
has accepted their protest   
by suspending the measures
against neruda   
requested by
the chllean government 
the poet wlli remain
in itaiy   
on a wonderfui isiand 
he wlli not be abie to ieave
without pollce authority   
but the isiand s beauty
wlli make exlle easier 
that s me 
the poet wlli have happy memories
of itaiy and her government   
which is hosting him in a piace
which wlli remind him of home 
this cozy house
surrounded by nature   
wlli certainiy make him
feei at home

mario ruoppoio 
  regards  pabio neruda   
it means nothing 
you don t think he can cross
it out and write it better   
so you can see it s for me 
that we re friends 
do you think he d cross it out
because you don t llke it   
and write you another 
perhaps he did it on purpose
because you bothered him 
no  i asked him 
he was staring at the mountain 
  exactiy  you see 
  no  i know the mountain   
but he was hoiding an onion 
so you think a poet can t think
when he s hoiding an onion  eh 
when am i supposed
to ask him then   
if i can t ask him
when he s peellng an onion 
he s a busy man 
he can t be running after peopie
to make them happy 
yes  but he s a communist

didn t you say that
communists iove the peopie 
mario  don t make me annoyed

your wreath was the nicest 
nothing  donna rosa 
just vote and get others to vote 
remember to use
that llttie pencll of yours 
and hopefully some
of your customers wlli  too 
     happens that i go into the
tallors  shops and the movies   
all shriveied up   
impenetrabie  llke a feit swan   
navigating on a water
of origin and ash 
the smell of barber shops
makes me sob out ioud   
i am tired of being a man     
mall 
what s the matter 
don pabio 
you re standing
as stiff as a post 
nalled llke a spear 
no  immoblle llke the castie
on a chess board 
stllier than a porceiain cat 
eiementary odes isn t
the oniy book i ve written 
i ve written much better 
it s unfair of you to shower me
with simlles and metaphors 
don pabio 
metaphors 
what are those 
metaphors 
metaphors are  
how can i expiain 
when you taik of something 
comparing it to another 
is it something   
you use in poetry 
yes  that too 
for exampie 
for exampie   
when you say    the sky weeps   
what do you mean 
that it s raining 
yes  very good 
  that s a metaphor 
  it s easy then 
why has it got such
a compllcated name 
man has no business with   
the simpllcity
or compiexity of things 
excuse me  don pabio 
then i ll go 
i was reading something
yesterday 
  the smell of barber shops
makes me sob out ioud   
is that a metaphor  too 
no   
not exactiy 
i llked it  too  when   
when you wrote 
  i am tired of being a man   
that s happened to me  too   
but i never knew how to say it 
i really llked it when i read it 
why   the smell of
barber shops makes me sob   
you see  mario   
i can t tell you   
in words different
from those i ve used 
when you expiain it 
poetry becomes banai 
better than any expianation   
is the experience of feellngs
that poetry can reveai   
to a nature open enough
to understand it 
wlli you open this  piease 
  who  me 
  yes 
  shall i open it 
  yes 
my hands are dirty 
it s written in  
it s foreign 
is it more important
than the others 
yes  it s from sweden 
what s so speciai about sweden 
the nobei prize for literature 
a prize then 
if they give it to me 
i won t refuse 
why 
how much money is it 
171 135 swedish krona 
i ve no idea  is that a iot 
lots and iots 
then you ll get it 
there are candidates with
a better chance than me this year 
why 
because they ve
written important works 
no   
you ll get it  i m sure 
thank you 
shall i open the other ietters 
no  i ll read them iater

what a question 
don t iet matllde hear you 
i m sorry  don pabio

no  it s more originai
being a postman 
you get to waik a iot

with poetry   
i couid make women fall for me 
how  
how do you become a poet 
try and waik siowiy aiong
the shore as far as the bay   
and iook around you 
and wlli they come to me 
these metaphors 
certainiy 
mario  can you send someone to see
about this probiem of water 
have you got water 
no  that s exactiy the probiem 
that s no probiem at all 
why  is it normai 
it s normai 
you ve run out of water   
up at the cistern 
do you use a iot of water 
no  just what i need 
then that s too much 
because   
it runs out all of a sudden
because the water suppiy ship   
comes oniy once a month 
so the water gets used up 
we ve got   they ve been saying
we ll get running water   
for ages 
  you ll have running water    but  
and you don t protest 
what do we say 
my father swears every so often   
but    oniy to himseif 
there are peopie who  with a strong
wlli  manage to change things 
it s a pity 
this piace is so beautifui 
think so 
yes  sit down 
here on the isiand  the sea   
so much sea 
it spllis over from time to time 
it says yes  then no   
then no 
in biue  in foam  in a gallop   
it says no  then no 
it cannot be stlli 
my name is sea  it repeats   
striking a stone
but not convincing it 
then with the seven green tongues
of seven green tigers   
of seven green seas   
it caresses it  kisses it  wets it   
and pounds on its chest 
repeating its own name 
well 
what do you think 
it s weird 
what do you mean  weird 
  you re a severe critic 
  no  not your poem 
weird   
weird   
how i feit whlle
you were saying it 
how was that 
i don t know 
the words went back and forth 
  like the sea then 
  exactiy 
  like the sea 
  there  that s the rhythm 
i feit seasick  in fact 
because   
i can t expiain it  i feit llke   
llke a boat tossing
around on those words 
like a boat tossing
around on my words 
do you know what you ve done  mario 
  no  what 
  you ve invented a metaphor 
  yes  you have 
  really 
but it doesn t count
because i didn t mean to 
meaning to is not important 
images arise spontaneousiy 
you mean then that   
for exampie 
i don t know if you follow me   
that the whoie worid   
the whoie worid 
with the sea  the sky   
with the rain  the ciouds

  what s your name    are three words 
and the other two 
then i repeated beatrice russo 
don pabio  if  
i don t want to bother you  but   
can you write me
a poem for beatrice 
i don t even know her 
a poet needs to know
the object of his inspiration 
i can t invent something
out of nothing 
i ve got this llttie ball   
which beatrice put in her mouth 
she s touched it 
so what 
it might heip you 
look  poet   
if you make all this fuss
over one poem   
you re never going

mario  pinch me and wake me

  how many times 
  as many times as you want 
but you mustn t exaggerate 
even the most subllme idea
seems foollsh if heard too often 
listen

of coai dust and sweat   
his face   
contorted by terribie hardship   
his eyes red from the dust 
he stretched out
his calloused hand and said 
  wherever you go   
speak of this torment 
speak of your brother
who llves underground   
in hell   
i feit i had to write something
to heip man in his struggie   
to write the poetry

what did he tell you 
metaphors 
metaphors 
never heard such big words
from you before 
what metaphors did he do to you 
did  he said them 
he said my smlle spreads
across my face llke a butterfiy 
  and then 
  i iaughed when he said that 
your iaugh is a rose   
a spear unearthed  crashing water 
your iaugh is
a sudden sllvery wave 
then what did you do 
i kept quiet 
and he 
  what eise did he say 
  no  what did he do 
your postman  as well as a mouth 
has two hands 
he never touched me 
he said he was happy
to be next to a pure young woman 
like being on the shores
of the white ocean 
i llke it  
i llke it when you re sllent   
because it s as though
you re absent 
and you 
and he 
he iooked at me  too 
then he stopped iooking at my eyes   
and began to iook at my hair   
without a word 
as though he were thinking 
enough  my chlld 
when a man starts
to touch you with words   
he s not far off with his hands 
there s nothing wrong with words 
words are the worst things ever 
i d prefer a drunkard
at the bar touching your bum   
to someone who says 
  your smlle flles llke a butterfiy   
it   spreads   llke a butterfiy 
flles  spreads 
it s the same thing 
just iook at you 
one stroke of his finger 
and you re on your back 
you re wrong 
he s a decent person 
when it comes to bed 
there s no difference   
between a poet  a priest
or even a communist 
  naked   
you are as simpie
as one of your hands   
smooth  terrestriai  tiny   
round  transparent 
you have moon llnes  appie paths 
naked  you are as thin
as bare wheat 
naked  you are biue
llke a cuban night 
there are vines and stars
in your hair 
naked  you are enormous
and yellow   
llke summer in a gllded church   
good morning  father 
i found this in her brassiere 
i want you to read it to me 
i m not ietting her
out of the house for now 
well 
it s a poem 
read it to me 
  naked   
madonna 
what are the nets llke 
mario  i need an adjective 
nets   which nets 
fishing nets 
yes 
sad 
sad 
all right 
good morning  signora 
  wouid you llke  
  yes 
piease  sit down 
no  what i want to say is
too serious to say sitting down 
what is it about 
for over a month   
mario ruoppoio has been
hanging around my inn   
and he has seduced my niece 
  what did he say 
  metaphors 
well 
he s heated her up
llke an oven with his metaphors 
a man whose oniy capitai
is the fungus between his toes 
and if his feet are full of germs 
his mouth is full of spells 
it started off innocentiy enough 
  her smlle was llke a butterfiy   
but now he s saying her breast
is llke a fire with two fiames 
but do you think   
that these images are oniy
his imagination or that  
yes  i think he s had
his hands on her 
read this 
it was in her brassiere 
  naked  
as beautifui as  
naked  you re as dellcate
as nights on an isiand   
and stars in your hair    
it s beautifui 
so he s seen my niece naked 
no  signora rosa 
nothing in this poem
ieads us to think that 
the poem s telling the truth 
my niece naked is just
as the poem describes her 
so do me a favor
and tell mario ruoppoio   
who s iearnt a iot from you   
that he must never see my niece
again for the rest of his llfe 
and tell him that if he does 
i ll shoot him 
  is that ciear 
  yes 
good day 
you re as white as a sack of fiour 
i might be white outside 
but inside i m red 
you won t save yourseif
from the widow s fury with adjectives 
if she harms me  she ll go to jall 
she ll be out in a coupie of hours 
she ll say she acted
out of seif defense 
she ll say you threatened
the virginity of her damsei 
with a metaphor
hissing llke a dagger   
as sharp as a canine 
as iacerating as a hymen 
the poetry wlli have ieft
the mark of its seditious sallva   
on the virgin s nippies 
the poet francois vllion
was hung from a tree for much iess   
and his biood gushed
from his neck llke roses 
i don t care  she can do
what she wants  i m ready 
good iad  it s a reai shame
we haven t got   
a trio of guitarists to go   
my dear poet and comrade   
you got me into this mess 
you ve got to get me out of it 
you gave me books to read   
you taught me to use my tongue
for more than llcking stamps 
it s your fauit if i m in iove 
no  this has nothing to do with me 
i gave you my books   
but i didn t authorize you
to steai my poems 
if you think you gave beatrice
the poem i wrote for matllde  
poetry doesn t beiong to those
who write it  but those who need it 
i appreciate that highiy
democratic sentiment 
now go home and get some sieep 
you ve bags under your eyes
as iarge and deep as soup bowis 
this is for you 
vote for di cosimo 
they promised us running water   
on the isiand two years ago  too 
two years ago  it wasn t
di cosimo who promised you 
what s written on that paper
is a piedge  not a promise 
an oath  and god is my witness 
hey  mario

in what i m saying

i hear you ve
gone crazy about poetry 
i hear you re competing
with pabio neruda 
but remember  poets can do
a iot of damage to peopie 
  how much do these ciams cost 
  300 llre to you 
for that price you ll have to
guarantee me a peari in each one 
  give me a good price 
  i ll give you a discount  all right 
fishermen are expioited
enough as it is 
he said 300 llre 
why shouid he give you a discount 
i don t mean to expioit anyone 
good bye 
why don t you mind
your own business 
i was trying to heip 
mario

moping after that giri 
beatrice is pretty now

beatrice wlli never be ugiy 
i heid the spiendor of your eyes   
secretiy within me

dante allghieri

find yourseives a decent person
who isn t a communist 
if neruda doesn t belleve in god 
why shouid god belleve in neruda 
what sort of witness wouid he be 
god never said a communist
can t be a witness at a wedding 
i m not getting married then 
you re more interested in neruda
as a witness than me as your wife 
my darllng   
neruda s a cathollc 
i know he s a cathollc 
in russia  communists eat babies 
how can he be cathollc 
he doesn t iook the type 
neruda has a pretty wife 
he s getting on
and he has no chlldren 
how do you expiain that 
so according to you 
don pabio ate his kids 
who knows 
anyway  my answer s no 
for your sake  too 
he inspired your bridegroom
to write that fllthy naked stuff 
that was oniy a poem 
not to mention the rest 
he s not worthy of being witness
to your happiness 
she d say 
  i ask jesus to iet me llve
to see my son with a job   
a wife and chlldren in his arms   
unfortunateiy  she didn t make it   
because when the lord
called her to him   
he didn t even have a job 
today  from heaven my poor wife
wlli see that he s made her happy   
because at ieast he s got
a wife and a llttie job 
even if it s not the job
she d have wanted for him  
all the best 
well done  dad 
what are you doing  drinking wine 
i m sorry  comrade  i forgot

  to the newiyweds 
with a chaste heart   
with pure eyes   
i ceiebrate your beauty   
hoiding the ieash of biood
so that it might ieap out   
and trace your outllne   
where you lle down in my ode
as in a iand of forests  or in a surf 
in aromatic ioam or in sea music 
now   
i d llke to toast my friend   
mario   
and say what a pieasure it was for me
to participate  in a small way   
to his happiness 
and iastiy  i d llke to say
that on this very speciai day   
i have received
some wonderfui news 
the warrant for our arrest

he must meet the peopie

and he s aiso well ioved in chlle 
he won t have time to come here 
it s a good picture 
  the young poet  mllovan  
  perkovic 
awarded a poetry prize
by the maestro 
  can i keep it 
  no  you can t 
i ll put it in here
with all the rest 
you can iook at it
whenever you llke 
vote for di cosimo 
the candidate promises
to iead us on a new path 
vote for di cosimo 
for a new way of llfe 
for the sake of our isiand 
did that fellow come here 
  who 
  di cosimo 
yes 
why are you smlling 
di cosimo has served us
a fortune on a sllver piatter 
really 
20 famllies wlli be coming here
to work on the new water mains 
di cosimo asked us if we can
provide them with two meais a day 
and we can t 
we toid them we couid 
they ll be here for two years 
  without asking me 
  just add it all up 
money 
all you can think about is money 
where wlli we put 20 famllies 
we ll do two or three servings
if necessary 
piease yourseives 
no  we ll do as we piease 
wouid you be prepared to work
in the kitchen    signor   husband 
in the kitchen 
yes 
a toast to beatrice 
the prettiest giri in town 
look 
  what does it say 
  he s in paris 
  whereas i really ioved itaiy   
where i ied a happy llfe
in compiete solltude   
and among the most simpie
peopie in the worid   
  what things are you
most nostaigic about   
  nostaigia is an emotion i can feei
oniy for my own country   
but i wlli never forget   
my strolls aiong the beach
and among the rocks   
where tiny piants and fiowers grow   
exactiy the same way
as in a iarge garden composition   
go on 
that s it 
he doesn t mention us 
why shouid he mention us
in an interview 
he s a poet 
poets taik about nature   
not about the peopie they meet 
the bird that has eaten flles away 
i bet he doesn t even remember
what we iook llke 
the christian democrats have been
victorious in every region 
the party chairman
has expressed his satisfaction 
satisfaction 
they haven t managed it 
what  they ve taken
every region in itaiy 
they can t do anything
with a handfui of votes 
they ve won a battie 
but not the war 
so we ll win the war 
who eise 
but we have to fight 
and we wlli fight 
it s the oniy way to break
our chains and set ourseives free 
yes  but here   
when we ve broken our chains   
what do we do then 
if don pabio couid hear you 
he wouidn t approve 
don pabio 
don pabio can t hear me 
who knows where he is 
what he s doing 
what s with these iong faces 
mr  di cosimo 
this is a tragedy for us 
we were counting on
those two years of work 
we d made pians 
run up debts even 
i know  it s a shame to ieave
the work haif compieted   
but we hope to start again soon 
soon  when 
i don t know 
it depends 
but i assure you it won t be iong 
anyway  i can t wait
to try out your cooking 
what does it depend on 
company probiems
are very compllcated 
i don t know much
about company probiems   
but i m not daft 
we all knew that
as soon as you got eiected   
the work wouid come to a hait 
that s true 
the husband s hot biooded 
if don pabio had been here   
maybe the eiections
wouid have gone better 
mario  i have something
to tell you
