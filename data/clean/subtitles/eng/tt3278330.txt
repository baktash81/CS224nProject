it was a mistake
i didnt know she was
in this condition my love please
please my love
forgive me my love
i will make you happy
who are you
i would not bother you
if i were not certain
that your majesties
will attach great importance
to what im about to say
ive heard the promises
of many charlatans before
and you have put many
in the stocks
fortunately
that does not concern me
you seem very sure of yourself
what will it cost
an act of courage and of sacrifice
what dyou mean by that
birth is always stained by death
and death in turn
is simply one element of birth
and not even the most dramatic one
be less mysterious
come to the point
you want a child
every new life
calls for a life to be lost
the equilibrium of the world
must be maintained
do you understand
i am prepared to die in order
to feel life grow inside me
we are speaking of possibility
not certainty
are you willing to accept the risk
what must we do
hunt down a sea monster
cut out its heart
and have it cooked by a virgin
but she must be alone
when your majesty eats the heart
you will become pregnant
instantly
which is the girl
you come here
you are still a virgin right
come with me
the queen needs you
hurry up
its coming your majesty
its coming
whats happening
whats happening
sixteen years later
elias
elias
where are you my dov
stop
elias
your highness
your highness
your highness
your highness
your highness
your highness
why must you continue
to disobey my commands
how many times have i told you
they must stop seeing each other
the next time that bastard boy
of yours comes anywhere near my son
i will throw you both out
you understand
dont look at me
now go
what does she have to do with this
what has she done wrong
take it out on me if you have to
but leave her out of it
how dare you talk to me like that
you disrespect me
and you disobey me
you know you were not supposed
to see him
come here
elias you are a prince
you cannot befriend
of a son of a servant
but i like being with him
hes like a brother to me
i will see him whenever i want
a brother
the only one bond of blood
that you have is with me
your mother
and its to me that you owe
respect and obedience
i am your queen
dont you ever forget it
you owe me an apology
im sorry mother
come
my son
if i ever see you with him again
you will both regret it
who sings with
such a beautiful voice
where have you been hiding
all this time
how is it that i have never met you
never even seen you
how old are you
seventeen
eighteen
no dont go dont go
dont hide
stay out in the sunlight
please stay out
to warm your cold king
oh i see
so you want to play hard to get
well so be it
i have fought many wars in my time
and even the most impregnable
fortress surrenders at last
who is it
i have a gift for you
from your king
what is it
its beautiful
let me try it dora
wait
wait
dora please
get the mirror
stop it
you dont think
we have to give it back
to the king
no
what good is it to us
makes us look more beautiful
dont you think
but whoever sees us
were always shut up inside here
i see you silly
there
okay ill keep this
at the closing of the day oh lord
watch over us as we sleep
keep us safe and warm in your heart
who is it
its me your king
did you like my present
have you tried it on
my royal heart is very generous
you know
ever since this morning
when i first heard you sing
i have been burning
in the furnace of desire come on
open up this door
so i can see you
hello
sir there must be
some misunderstanding
i see
you are going to tease me
arent you
let me see you for heavens sake
you like playing with your king
play with you sir
oh no
im just a poor girl i dont deserve
the honor you bestow on me
the honor what honor
its desire that drives me
open up this door let me in
let me see you for damned sake
dora what shall we do
let me think
we must not let
an opportunity like this get away
your majesty
yes
you cant imagine how the modesty
of this young virgin
is being put to the test
by your offer
i
all my hearts aflutter
i feel faint
but all i can promise you today
is this
come back in a weeks time
and i will give you a part of me
that alone illustrates my beauty
which part of your body
will you grant me
a finger your majesty
a finger
a finger
well all right my jasmine flower
my little honeysuckle
i shall wait
and i shall return and admire
the eighth wonder of the world
your rosy maidenly finger
what shall we do dora
well think of something
this next piece
i composed myself for my father
to whom i dedicate it
with all my heart
he grabs the iron bars
pulling and shaking them
bending the metal and tearing
the bars from the wall
could you just read the part
where they kiss
then the queen her arms extends
and to her breast his head she bends
and on the bed in warm embrace
the queen displays her radiant face
now lancelot has what he desires
the queens embrace sets him on fire
so sweet a game to kiss and hold
such pleasure this if truth be told
no one ever felt before
such joy in loving they adore
and now we should leave
could we read it again
your majesty
yes
some papers to sign
later later
im sorry your majesty they are
rather urgent people want paying
all is so urgent
my lord and father
at my age a girl
should already know
what sort of gallantries
men are capable of
she should be learning to distinguish
whose heart is sincere
and who instead tells lies
if i stay here
my head will always be empty
and i fear my heart will be too
before long you will be
old enough to be married
and then you will depart
these walls forever
well
if that is indeed the case
then find me a husband
a husband
what sort of husband would you like
well
id like my husband to be
courageous and strong and
handsome
im sure such a man exists
but until we find him
please
do not agitate yourself over a future
none of us can predict
now let us finish our supper
what is it my dear
its not cooked enough
really
yes yes yes
hello
hello
elias
come my doy

i cant make up my mind
about the earrings tonight

the will of such a great king

and willing to grant your desires
i only ask of you this one favor

your majesty
no one
this is my favorite color
i love this
neckline is very attractive
so have you found
something to please you
yes they are all so beautiful
why did you send for them
you want to look beautiful
on your wedding day dont you
so im to be married
of course
you were right violet
its time i found you a husband
i understand you are bored
living here with us at the castle
and in this way you can venture forth
and discover new places
its what you wanted
yes
then who will my husband be father
well
he will be braver than
the most valiant knight
and wiser even than
our own court doctor
thank you
what is his name
not even i know his name yet
how can that be
do you not know him
surely as an avid reader
you know that
the husband of a princess can only
be discovered through a tournament
so i wont choose him myself
what if i dont love him
you will love him violet
you will
of course it is possible that
no suitor will pass the test
then what will i do
then fate will have decided
that you must live a while longer
with your old father
your turn
this is the hide of a sow
no
next
he is very serious
hes old
verrus singularis silvano
no
verrus singularis silvano no
next
father
a moment
what is it
please im longing to know
just tell me what piece
that strange hide belongs to
no its forbidden
i wont tell a soul
its impossible
im your daughter
oh very well i can deny you nothing
you wish to know to which beast
this hide belongs
yes
it is the skin of a flea
continue
giant manatee
sorry
no
next
no no
everyone has the right to guess
father
its fine
flea
what
flea
violet
no
violet
no wait
please stop
i never imagined anyone would guess
im sorry
i understand
it was never my intention that
i would give you to such a monster
but what can i do
you heard the proclamation
i cant go back on my word
violet
patience my blessed child
perhaps perhaps violet
perhaps the will of god
is behind this unusual fate
i know you are scared but
my heart tells me that
you will find a strength to be happy
happy
you tried to deceive me
with your words father
your heart tells you
you have no heart
silence you forget the duties
and obligations of a king
youre not a king
youre not even a man
not even a beast
beasts at least love their offspring
they try to protect them
but not you im nothing to you
i wish that my mother
had strangled me in my crib
instead of leaving me in your hands
silence
whatever i do is done well
no one has the right to question
my will least of all my daughter
fear not
your obligations shall be respected
no one will be able to say that
the king did not keep to his word
sit
im sorry your majesty
