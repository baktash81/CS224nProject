   bill gasps 
wow 
didn t this place
used to be bigger 
yo   stutters 
mike  where are you going 
mike  you live here 
yeah 
make yourself at home 
 fridge door opens 
  you want some water 
   bill  yeah  sure 
 water pouring 
you see  memory s the thing 
it s the key 
it s the key
to everything 
if it really does want
us  stutters  back here 
don t you think the
smartest thing we can do
is just get the hell
out of derry 
no  no  no 
it does want us back 
of course it does 
but it doesn t know
i know what i know 
what do you know 
how to kill the shit
out of it 
i ve read every book 
i ve talked to every person
in this godforsaken town 
everybody that would talk to
me  anyway 
and that s not a long list 
but it wasn t enough 
i had to know
how this all started 
how it started 
and it started
  here 
  whoa 
  what am i looking at  mike 
  it s an artifact 
early 18th century shokopiwah 
shoko   
how d you get it 
i found it  in the   
no  no 
they gave it to me 
i stole it 
you stole it 
  from native americans 
  uh   
  it s complicated 
  yeah  it is 
they helped me
on my journey 
so beautiful 
they showed me things 
a vision 
ow 
holy fuck 
i feel kind of funky 
hot 
am i sweating 
i need you to see
what they showed me  bill 
 echoing  bill 
they live outside of derry 
beyond it s reach 
they moved there
many years ago 
their holy man 
their holy of holies 
he took me in 
 speaking native language 
 mike in english 
fed me their sacred maturin 
i started to   
to react 
all living things
must abide by the laws
of the shape they inhabit 
 screaming 
 mike  while i sat there 
looking out over the valley 
i saw it arrive 
i knew that one day 
i would have to make you all see 
mike 
did you put something
in my drink 
it s  uh   
it s a root 
you     stutters 
you drugged me 
you drugged me 
no  it s a root
with properties 
it s just a micro dose of
what the shokopiwah gave me   
why would you do that 
   to open my eyes 
i don t feel real good 
i need you to look 
and you ll see 
 bill  i don t feel good 
 mike  open your eyes 
open your eyes 
they showed me the past 
 yelps 
showed me the way
it appeared to them 
 whimpering 
 screams 
they showed me
their pain 
 both screaming 
they showed me
how to stop it 
 native americans chanting
in native language 
 bill breathing heavily 
it s over 
it s over 
you re okay 
you re okay 
did you see it 
the ritual 
  the ritual of chud 
  yeah  i knew you   
i knew you would see it 
i saw the whole fucking
thing  mike 
that s how we kill it 
how are we going
to do it 
everybody already
 stuttering  said no 
but with you 
they ll listen 
this won t work
without all of us 
okay  so  what do you mean
that you ve seen us all die 
yeah 
 cause i gotta be honest 
that s a fucked up thing
to just drop on somebody 
every night since derry 
i ve been having
these nightmares 
people in pain 
people dying 
people   
 eddie 
so  you have nightmares 
i have nightmares 
people  they have nightmares 
but that doesn t mean
that your visions are true 
i ve watched
every single one of us   
 bill  you ve seen
every single one of us what 
at the place that
stanley wound up 
that s how we end 
okay  how come the rest of
us aren t seeing that shit 
i mean 
what makes her so different 
the deadlights 
the deadlights 
she was the only
one of us
that got caught in
the deadlights that day 
we were all
touched by it 
changed 
deep down  like an infection 
or a virus 
a virus 
you understand 
slowly growing 
that virus 
it s been growing for 27 years 
this whole time 
metastasizing 
it just got to stan
first  because   
he was the weakest 
jesus christ  rich 
just saying what everyone
else is thinking  man 
i mean 
rich  come on 
what beverly sees 
it will come to pass 
it s what ll happen to
all of us  eventually 
unless we stop it 
how the hell are we
supposed to do that 
the ritual of chud 
the shokopiwah 
the first ones who fought
it  they have a saying 
 all living things
must abide by
 the laws of the
shape they inhabit  
a tribal ritual 
are you fucking kidding me  man 
all right 
there s gotta be another way 
okay  this thing comes
back  what  every 27 years 
let s just kick the can down
the road and do it then 
wait  we ll be 70 years
old  asshole 
 beverly  it doesn t
work that way 
none of us make it
another 20 years 
and the way it happens   
so  if we don t beat it
this cycle  then   
we die 
horribly 
yeah  i don t need
the  horribly  part 
i didn t say it 
she said it  not me 
 bill  all right  guys 
look 
i ve seen  stuttering 
what he s talking about 
and it s all true 
it s the only way 
if we want
this ritual to work   
we have to remember 
remember what 
 wind blowing 
 mike  it s better
if i show you 
we don t have
much time 
his cycle
will end soon 
and once it does   
 eddie  we re fucked 
 beverly  the barrens 
this is where we came 
after the rock fight 
the clubhouse 
you built that for us 
yeah  the hatch has got to
be around here someplace 
 eddie  you did 
i do remember that 
  oh 
  whoa  whoa 
you okay 
 beverly laughs 
  what 
  nothing  it s just   
you haven t changed 
it s a good thing 
 both chuckle 
you know what 
i actually think the door was more like
around   
 crashing 
found it 
i m okay 
come down 
what the dick is this 
how d you build it 
when did you build it 
here and there 
i guess 
it was already dug
out from something 
so i just had to
reinforce the walls
and get some wood
for the roof door 
and that s pretty much it 
pretty good for
my first time  huh 
 young stanley yelps 
 young richie  now 
that s a cool feature 
what happens when
you put your hand
on the other pillar 
professor 
okay  you see  this is exactly
why there are safety codes 
why we have permits 
this place is a death trap 
you understand that 
well  it s a work in progress 
okay  eddie 
just so you know  i get
hurt  you are liable 
and  also  what is this 
the switch of an iron maiden 
that s a flashlight 
what is that 
a horse hitch 
when do you have
horses down   
oh  this is cool 
that was like 
three dollars 
so be careful with that  please 
i have one of these 
hey  stan  you see this 
yeah  okay 
can you maybe not 
maybe not what  yeah  yeah  hold on 
maybe not what 
be awesome and have fun
and celebrate the magic
of the paddle ball 
wow 
oh  good going  fucknut 
you broke his thing 
  i broke it 
  yeah 
you broke it
with your face 
what 
 young eddie  i m not putting
my fucking hand down there 
 blows 
 eddie  oh  man 
that s so cool 
 bill  oh  my god 
 eddie  how do we all not
remember that this was here 
 richie as pennywise 
hey  losers 
time to float 
 laughing 
  ahh 
  fuck  richie 
  dude 
  remember when he used to say
that shit 
and he d do that little dance 
 vocalizing 
am i the only one
who remembers this shit 
are you gonna be like this
the entire time we re home 
all right  just trying to
add some levity to this shit 
i ll go fuck myself 
 whistling 
it smells so fucking
terrible in here 
hey  you guys 
 stuttering  this says  stan  
 for the use
of losers only  
bill 
    80s music playing 
  the fuck is this 
so you don t get
spiders stuck
in your hair
when you re down here 
stanley  we re not afraid
of fucking spiders 
i stand corrected 
 laughs  that s a first 
touche 
hey  rich 
your ten minutes are up 
what are you talking about 
the hammock 
ten minutes each was the rule 
  i don t see any sign 
   young eddie  are you
being this way right now 
really  no  no  no 
why would there be a sign if
it was a verbal agreement 
and i remember you agreeing
on the fucking rule 
 both grunting 
 young richie 
i can see your vagina 
 young eddie 
ten minutes each 
 young richie  go back in
your dumb little corner 
i fucked your mom 
 young eddie  no  you didn t 
take that back 
you re awfully good at
this  new kid 
you really think so 
there s actually a summer
program in bar harbor 
teaches you  like 
everything about architecture 
i was thinking about applying 
 young richie  i ll do that 
i ll do anything to get
the hell out of derry 
man  when i graduate 
i m going to florida 
what s in florida  mike 
i don t know 
you know  i guess it s just a
place i always wanted to go 
stan  you should go
with mike to florida 
you already act 80 
you d clean up with all the grandmas 
 imitates kissing 
 all laughing 
do you guys think
we ll still be friends 
when we re older 
 young richie  what 
why wouldn t we be 
do any of your parents
still hang out
with their friends
from middle school 
i mean  things might
be different then 
we all might be different 
we ll always still be friends 
i don t think that just 
you know 
 stuttering  goes away
because we get older 
 young beverly 
yeah  stan  come on 
you don t have
to be so   
sad 
he was old
before his time 
 eddie  yeah 
i wonder what he was
like all grown up 
probably what he
was like as a kid 
the best 
here 
all right  mike 
what are we doing here 
the ritual 
to perform it
requires a sacrifice 
  sacrifice  i nominate eddie 
  wait  what 
because you re little 
you ll fit on a barbeque 
i m 5 9   it s  like 
average height in most of the world 
it s not that kind of
a sacrifice  guys 
mike 
the past is buried 
but you re gonna have
to dig it up 
piece by piece 
and these pieces 
these artifacts 
that s why we re here 
they are
what you ll sacrifice 
and since stan
isn t here to find his   
i figured we should
all be here together
to find his artifact 
i think bill just did that 
okay  mike  so where
do we find our tokens 
yeah  i gotta be honest  man 
all due respect 
this is fucking stupid 
all right 
why do we need tokens 
all right 
we already remember
everything 
saving bev 
defeating it   
i mean 
we re caught up 
it s not everything 
we fought 
but what happened after that 
before the house
on neibolt 
think 
 stuttering  we can t
remember  can we 
see  there s more to our story 
what happened that summer 
and those blank spaces 
like pages torn out of a book 
that s what
you need to find 
we need to split up 
you each need to
find your artifact 
alone 
that s important 
when you do 
meet me
at the library tonight 
 eddie  yeah 
i gotta say 
statistically speaking 
you look at survival scenarios 
we re gonna do much
better as a group 
yeah  splitting up
would be dumb  man 
okay  we gotta go together 
all right 
we were together that
summer  right 
 bill  no 
not that  stutters 
whole summer 
 young bill 
take it back 
   groans 
   young beverly  bill 
you re just
a bunch of losers 
fuck off 
  fucking   
  stop 
we were all together
when we hurt it 
that s why
we re still alive 
yeah  well 
i plan to keep it that way 
 young beverly 
i bet by tomorrow 
we ll all be
back together 
 stutters  i don t think so 
well  if we re gonna stop
it  we better be 
maybe richie was right 
maybe we shouldn t do anything about
it  or maybe we can t 
okay  don t let them
get to you

 young stanley
singing in hebrew 
 congregants responding 
 young stanley  reflecting
on the meaning of
what i just read 
the word  leshanot 
comes up a lot 
which means  to
change  to transform  
which makes sense 
i guess 
because today i m
supposed to become a man 
it s funny  though 
everyone  i think 
has some memories
they re prouder of
than others  right 
 timer beeping 
and maybe that s why
change is so scary 
 cause the things we wish
we could leave behind   
  good morning  mike 
  how you doing 
   the whispers we wish
we could silence   
his pa is the one 
the one that set that fire 
   the nightmares we most
want to wake up from 
the memories we wish
we could change   
   the secrets we feel
like we have to keep
are the hardest to
walk away from 
the good stuff 
the pictures in our mind
that fade away the fastest 
those pieces of you it
feels the easiest to lose 
  maybe i don t want to forget 
   camera clicking 
maybe if that s what
today is all about 
forget it  right 
  thank you  stanley 
   stammering 
today  i m supposed
to become a man 
but i don t feel
any different 
i know i m a loser 
and no matter what 
  i always fucking will be

literally a french word

 young richie  i knew there
was something rotten about it 
   cell phone ringing 
   bill sighs 
  mike 
  hey   chuckles 
i just thought
i d check up on you 
you know 
just to see if you learned
how to finish
a book for once 
 chuckling 
i just finished
the first chapter 
and i think i actually know
where i m going this time 
good 
say  can i ask
you a question 
sure 
why do you think
we re not forgetting 
you know  like last time 
maybe  cause it s dead 
or maybe  cause
we have more
we want to remember
than we want to forget 
i like that one 
you decide
what you want to do 
about leaving derry 
man  i ve been in this cell
for 27 years 
just seeing
what it wanted me to 
i think it s time i saw
the sky for a change 
go get it  mikey 
oh  did you get the letter 
 stammers 
what letter 
you ll know
when you see it 
well  hold on 
i just got the mail 
we all got one 
 bill  patricia uris 
just   
just read it 
okay 
and call me 
anytime 
i will 
and  bill 
i love you  man 
i love you  too 
all right 
see you around 
 stanley  dear losers 
i know what this must seem like 
but this isn t
a suicide note 
you re probably wondering
why i did what i did 
it s because i knew i was
too scared to go back 
and if
we weren t together 
if all of us alive
weren t united 
i knew we d all die 
so  i made
the only logical move 
i took myself
off the board 
did it work 
 stanley sighs 
well  if you re reading
this  you know the answer 
i lived
my whole life afraid 
afraid of
what would come next 
afraid of what
i might leave behind 
don t 
be who you want to be 
be proud 
you sleep okay 
yeah 
i had a beautiful dream 
 stanley  and if you find
someone worth holding on to 
never ever let them go 
follow your own path 
wherever that takes you 
think of this letter
as a promise 
 eddie  a promise
i m asking you to make 
 mike  to me 
 ben  to each other 
 beverly  an oath 
 stanley  see 
the thing about being a loser
is you don t have
anything to lose 
so   
 young richie 
be true 
 young eddie 
be brave 
 young mike  stand 
 young beverly  believe 
 young bill
