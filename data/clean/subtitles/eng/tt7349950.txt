they showed me the past
yelps
showed me the way
it appeared to them
whimpering
screams
they showed me
their pain
both screaming
they showed me
how to stop it
native americans chanting
in native language
bill breathing heavily
its over
its over
youre okay
youre okay
did you see it
the ritual
the ritual of chud
yeah i knew you
i knew you would see it
i saw the whole fucking
thing mike
thats how we kill it
how are we going
to do it
everybody already
stuttering said no
but with you
theyll listen
this wont work
without all of us
okay so what do you mean
that youve seen us all die
yeah
cause i gotta be honest
thats a fuckedup thing
to just drop on somebody
every night since derry
ive been having
these nightmares
people in pain
people dying
people
eddie
so you have nightmares
i have nightmares
people they have nightmares
but that doesnt mean
that your visions are true
ive watched
every single one of us
bill youve seen
every single one of us what
at the place that
stanley wound up
thats how we end
okay how come the rest of
us arent seeing that shit
i mean
what makes her so different
the deadlights
the deadlights
she was the only
one of us
that got caught in
the deadlights that day
we were all
touched by it
changed
deep down like an infection
or a virus
a virus
you understand
slowly growing
that virus
its been growing for 27 years
this whole time
metastasizing
it just got to stan
first because
he was the weakest
jesus christ rich
just saying what everyone
else is thinking man
i mean
rich come on
what beverly sees
it will come to pass
its whatll happen to
all of us eventually
unless we stop it
how the hell are we
supposed to do that
the ritual of chud
the shokopiwah
the first ones who fought
it they have a saying
all living things
must abide by
the laws of the
shape they inhabit
a tribal ritual
are you fucking kidding me man
all right
theres gotta be another way
okay this thing comes
back what every 27 years
lets just kick the can down
the road and do it then
wait well be 70 years
old asshole
beverly it doesnt
work that way
none of us make it
another 20 years
and the way it happens
so if we dont beat it
this cycle then
we die
horribly
yeah i dont need
the horribly part
i didnt say it
she said it not me
bill all right guys
look
ive seen stuttering
what hes talking about
and its all true
its the only way
if we want
this ritual to work
we have to remember
remember what
wind blowing
mike its better
if i show you
we dont have
much time
his cycle
will end soon
and once it does
eddie were fucked
beverly the barrens
this is where we came
after the rock fight
the clubhouse
you built that for us
yeah the hatch has got to
be around here someplace
eddie you did
i do remember that
oh
whoa whoa
you okay
beverly laughs
what
nothing its just
you havent changed
its a good thing
both chuckle
you know what
i actually think the door was more like
around
crashing
found it
im okay
come down
what the dick is this
howd you build it
when did you build it
here and there
i guess
it was already dug
out from something
so i just had to
reinforce the walls
and get some wood
for the roof door
and thats pretty much it
pretty good for
my first time huh
young stanley yelps
young richie now
thats a cool feature
what happens when
you put your hand
on the other pillar
professor
okay you see this is exactly
why there are safety codes
why we have permits
this place is a death trap
you understand that
well its a work in progress
okay eddie
just so you know i get
hurt you are liable
and also what is this
the switch of an iron maiden
thats a flashlight
what is that
a horse hitch
when do you have
horses down
oh this is cool
that was like
three dollars
so be careful with that please
i have one of these
hey stan you see this
yeah okay
can you maybe not
maybe not what yeah yeah hold on
maybe not what
be awesome and have fun
and celebrate the magic
of the paddleball
wow
oh good going fucknut
you broke his thing
i broke it
yeah
you broke it
with your face
what
young eddie im not putting
my fucking hand down there
blows
eddie oh man
thats so cool
bill oh my god
eddie how do we all not
remember that this was here
richie as pennywise
hey losers
time to float
laughing
ahh
fuck richie
dude
remember when he used to say
that shit
and hed do that little dance
vocalizing
am i the only one
who remembers this shit
are you gonna be like this
the entire time were home
all right just trying to
add some levity to this shit
ill go fuck myself
whistling
it smells so fucking
terrible in here
hey you guys
stuttering this says stan
for the use
of losers only
bill
80s music playing
the fuck is this
so you dont get
spiders stuck
in your hair
when youre down here
stanley were not afraid
of fucking spiders
i stand corrected
laughs thats a first
touche
hey rich
your ten minutes are up
what are you talking about
the hammock
ten minutes each was the rule
i dont see any sign
young eddie are you
being this way right now
really no no no
why would there be a sign if
it was a verbal agreement
and i remember you agreeing
on the fucking rule
both grunting
young richie
i can see your vagina
young eddie
ten minutes each
young richie go back in
your dumb little corner
i fucked your mom
young eddie no you didnt
take that back
youre awfully good at
this new kid
you really think so
theres actually a summer
program in bar harbor
teaches you like
everything about architecture
i was thinking about applying
young richie ill do that
ill do anything to get
the hell out of derry
man when i graduate
im going to florida
whats in florida mike
i dont know
you know i guess its just a
place i always wanted to go
stan you should go
with mike to florida
you already act 80
youd clean up with all the grandmas
imitates kissing
all laughing
do you guys think
well still be friends
when were older
young richie what
why wouldnt we be
do any of your parents
still hang out
with their friends
from middle school
i mean things might
be different then
we all might be different
well always still be friends
i dont think that just
you know
stuttering goes away
because we get older
young beverly
yeah stan come on
you dont have
to be so
sad
he was old
before his time
eddie yeah
i wonder what he was
like all grown up
probably what he
was like as a kid
the best
here
all right mike
what are we doing here
the ritual
to perform it
requires a sacrifice
sacrifice i nominate eddie
wait what
because youre little
youll fit on a barbeque
im 59 its like
average height in most of the world
its not that kind of
a sacrifice guys
mike
the past is buried
but youre gonna have
to dig it up
piece by piece
and these pieces
these artifacts
thats why were here
they are
what youll sacrifice
and since stan
isnt here to find his
i figured we should
all be here together
to find his artifact
i think bill just did that
okay mike so where
do we find our tokens
yeah i gotta be honest man
all due respect
this is fucking stupid
all right
why do we need tokens
all right
we already remember
everything
saving bev
defeating it
i mean
were caught up
its not everything
we fought
but what happened after that
before the house
on neibolt
think
stuttering we cant
remember can we
see theres more to our story
what happened that summer
and those blank spaces
like pages torn out of a book
thats what
you need to find
we need to split up
you each need to
find your artifact
alone
thats important
when you do
meet me
at the library tonight
eddie yeah
i gotta say
statistically speaking
you look at survival scenarios
were gonna do much
better as a group
yeah splitting up
would be dumb man
okay we gotta go together
all right
we were together that
summer right
bill no
not that stutters
whole summer
young bill
take it back
groans
young beverly bill
youre just
a bunch of losers
fuck off
fucking
stop
we were all together
when we hurt it
thats why
were still alive
yeah well
i plan to keep it that way
young beverly
i bet by tomorrow
well all be
back together
stutters i dont think so
well if were gonna stop
it we better be
maybe richie was right
maybe we shouldnt do anything about
it or maybe we cant

singing in hebrew
congregants responding
young stanley reflecting
on the meaning of
what i just read
the word leshanot
comes up a lot
which means to
change to transform
which makes sense
i guess
because today im
supposed to become a man
its funny though
everyone i think
has some memories
theyre prouder of
than others right
timer beeping
and maybe thats why
change is so scary
cause the things we wish
we could leave behind
good morning mike
how you doing
the whispers we wish
we could silence
his pa is the one
the one that set that fire
the nightmares we most
want to wake up from
the memories we wish
we could change
the secrets we feel
like we have to keep
are the hardest to
walk away from
the good stuff
the pictures in our mind
that fade away the fastest
those pieces of you it
feels the easiest to lose
maybe i dont want to forget
camera clicking
maybe if thats what
today is all about
forget it right
thank you stanley
stammering
today im supposed
to become a man
but i dont feel
any different
i know im a loser

i just thought
id check up on you
you know
just to see if you learned
how to finish
a book for once
chuckling
i just finished
the first chapter
and i think i actually know
where im going this time
good
say can i ask
you a question
sure
why do you think
were not forgetting
you know like last time
maybe cause its dead
or maybe cause
we have more
we want to remember
than we want to forget
i like that one
you decide
what you want to do
about leaving derry
man ive been in this cell
for 27 years
just seeing
what it wanted me to
i think its time i saw
the sky for a change
go get it mikey
oh did you get the letter
stammers

youll know
when you see it
well hold on
i just got the mail
we all got one
bill patricia uris
just
just read it
okay
and call me
anytime
i will
and bill
i love you man
i love you too
all right
see you around
stanley dear losers
i know what this must seem like
but this isnt
a suicide note
youre probably wondering
why i did what i did
its because i knew i was
too scared to go back
and if
we werent together
if all of us alive
werent united
i knew wed all die
so i made
the only logical move
i took myself
off the board
did it work
stanley sighs
well if youre reading
this you know the answer
i lived
my whole life afraid
afraid of
what would come next
afraid of what
i might leave behind
dont
be who you want to be
be proud
you sleep okay
yeah
i had a beautiful dream
stanley and if you find
someone worth holding on to
never ever let them go
follow your own path
wherever that takes you
think of this letter
as a promise
eddie a promise
im asking you to make
mike to me
ben to each other
beverly an oath
stanley see
the thing about being a loser
is you dont have
anything to lose
so
young richie
be true
young eddie
be brave
young mike stand
young beverly believe
young bill
