have you found religion  henry 
will you look down from heaven and
see who s sitting on your throne 
i must know before i die 
there s a legend of a king called
lear  with whom i have a lot in common 
both of us have kingdoms
and three children we adore 
and both of us are old 
but there it ends 
he cuts his kingdom into bits 
i can t do that 
i ve built an empire  and
i must know it s going to last 
all of britain 
half of france   
i m the greatest power in a thousand
years  and after me comes john 
i m going to lose you 
henry  aren t i 
alais  in my time i ve known   
contessas  milkmaids 
courtesans   
and novices 
whores  gypsies  jades   
and little boys 
but nowhere in god s western world
have i found anyone to love but you 
and rosamund 
  she s dead 
  and eleanor 
the new medusa  my good wife 
how is your queen 
decaying  i suppose 
no  don t be jealous
of the gorgon 
she is not
among the things i love 
how many husbands do you know
who dungeon up their wives 
i haven t kept the great bitch in the keep
for ten years out of passionate attachment 
  there s captain marshal 
william 
we will be holding
christmas court at chinon 
we have asked the king of france
to join us 
i want richard there and geoffrey 
go find my boys and tell them 
then go fetch the queen
from salisbury tower 
if the queen refuses 
eleanor 
she wouldn t miss this
for the world 
richard 
richard 
hello  richard 
forward 
forward 
geoffrey 
geoffrey 
geoffrey 
father wants to see me 
your majesty 
there s to be
a christmas court 
yes  madam 
where 
at chinon 
henry  what if  just for once 
i didn t do as i was told 
it s going to be
a jungle of a day 
if i start growling now 
i ll never last 
you ll last 
you re like the rocks at
stonehenge    nothing knocks you down 
in these rooms  alais  on this
christmas  i have all the enemies i need 
you have more than you think 
are you one 
has my willow
turned to poison oak 
if i decided to be trouble 
henry  how much trouble could i be 
not much 
i could give away your plans 
you don t know what they are 
i know you want to disinherit
richard  so does eleanor 
she knows young henry s dead 
the young king died in summer  and i haven t
named an heir  she knows i want john   
on the throne  and i know she wants
richard    we are very frank about it 
henry  i can t be your mistress
if i m married to your son 
why can t you 
johnny wouldn t mind 
i do not like your johnny 
he s a good boy 
he s got pimples 
and he smells of compost 
he s just 16 
he can t help the pimples 
he could have a bath 
it isn t such a dreadful thing
to be queen of england 
not all eyes will weep for you 
will yours 
i don t know 
very likely 
all i want is not to lose you 
can t you hide me 
can t i simply disappear 
you know you can t 
your little brother philip s king of france now 
and he wants your wedding or your dowry back 
i only took you for your
dowry  you were seven   
two big knees and two big eyes 
and that s all 
how was i to know 
hey  what s the matter  lad  nothing 
  geoff 
  johnny 
is that for me 
i love christmas 
what difference does
my dowry make 
let philip have it back 
it isn t much  i can t 
the vexin is a little county 
but it s vital to me  and i m not 
it s been my luck to fall
in love with landed women 
when i married eleanor
i thought   you lucky man 
 the richest woman in the
world    she owns the aquitaine 
the greatest province in the
continent  and beautiful as well  
she was  you know 
and you adored her 
memory fails  there may
have been an era when i did 
let s have one strand askew  nothing
in life has any business being perfect 
if i say you and i are done 
we re done 
if i say marry john  it s john 
i ll have you by me 
and i ll use you as i like 
ah  christmas   
warm and rosy time 
the hot wine steams 
the yule log roars 
and we re the fat
that s in the fire 
she ll be here soon 
you know  who  mother 
she still want you to be king  we
are not as friendly as we used to be 
if i m supposed to make a fuss
and kiss her hairy cheek  i won t 
what you kiss 
little prince  is up to you 
i m father s favorite 
that s what counts 
you hardly know me  johnny  so i
beg you to believe my reputation 
i am a constant soldier  a
sometime poet  and i will be king 
just you remember   
father loves me best 
why john  john doesn t
care for you at all 
we love each other deeply  none
of them has any love for you 
because we fight 
tell me all three want the crown  i ll
tell you it s a feeble prince that doesn t 
they may snap at me and plot  and that
makes them the kind of sons i want 
i ve snapped and plotted
all my life 
there s no other way to be a
king  alive and 50 all at once 
i m going to fight for you 
oh  fine 
how was your crossing 
did the channel part for you 
it went flat when i told it to 
i didn t think to ask for more 
how dear of you to let me out of
jail  it s only for the holidays 
like school  you keep me young 
here s gentle alais 
no  greet me as you used to 
fragile i am not 
affection is a pressure
i can bear 
oh  but i do have
handsome children 
john  you re so clean and neat 
henry takes good care of you 
and richard 
don t look sullen  dear  it makes
your eyes go small and piggy   
and your chin look weak 
geoffrey 
is philip here yet 
not yet 
let s hope he s
grown up like his father   
simon pure and simon simple   
good  good  louis 
if i had managed sons for him
instead of all those little girls 
i d still be stuck
with being queen of france 
and we should not have
known each other 
such  my angels 
is the role of sex in history 
that will be philip 
where s henry 
upstairs with the family whore 
that s a mean and tawdry way
to talk about your fiancee 
my fiancee 
whose ever fiancee 
i brought her up  and she
is dear to me and gentle 
he still plans to make john
king  of course he does 
my  what a greedy little trinity
you are    king  king  king 
two of you must learn to live with
disappointment  ah  but which two 
let s deny them all
and live forever 
tusk to tusk
through all eternity 
ah  my boys 
the king of france and i will
shortly have a tactile conversation 
like two surgeons
looking for a lump 
we ll state positions  and i ll make the first
of many offers  he ll refuse it  naturally 
i ll make a better one  and so on
through the holidays until i win 
for the duration of this joyous ritual
you will give to your father your support 
  my lord 
  your grace 
welcome to chinon 
ah  that s better 
i was told you were impressive
for a boy of 17 
  i m eleanor  who might have been your mother 
  queen eleanor 
all the others here you know 
i gather you re disturbed
about your sister and her dowry 
sixteen years ago
you made a treaty with us 
  it is time its terms were executed 
  i should think so 
our position comes to this 
that you will either hold the
marriage or return the vexin 
alais marries richard  or we ll
have the county back at once 
that s clear  concise
and well presented 
my position   
well  frankly  philip 
it s a tangle 
two years ago  the queen and i   
for reasons passing understanding   
gave the aquitaine to richard 
that makes richard
very powerful 
how can i give him alais too 
the man she marries
has you for an ally 
it s their wedding or the vexin back 
those are the terms you made with louis 
true  but academic  lad 
the vexin s mine 
by what authority  it s got my troops
all over it  that makes it mine 
now  hear me  boy 
i am a king  i am no man s boy  a king 
because you put your ass
on purple cushions 
  sir 
  philip 
you haven t got
the feel of this at all  lad 
use all your voices 
when i bellow  bellow back 
i ll mark that down 
this too 
we are the world in small 
a nation is a human thing  it
does what we do  for our reasons 
surely if we re civilized 
we can put away the knives 
we can make peace 
we have it in our hands 
i ve tutors of my own 
will that be all  oh  think 
you came here for a reason  don t you
want to ask me if i ve got an offer 
have you got an offer  not
yet  but i ll think of one 
oh  by the way 
you re better at this
than i thought you d be 
i wasn t sure you d noticed 
well  what shall we hang   
the holly or each other 
would you say  father  that i have
the makings of a king  a splendid king 
and would you expect me  father 
to give up without a fight 
of course you ll fight 
i raised you to 
i don t care what you offer philip 
i don t care what plans you make 
i ll have the aquitaine
and alais and the crown 
i ll not give up one
to get the other 
i won t trade off alais or the
aquitaine to that walking pustule 
no  your loving son will not 
did you hear what he
called me  clearly  dear 
now  run along  it s nearly dinnertime 
i only do what father tells me 
go and eat 
did i say something wrong 
i m always saying something
wrong  and don t pout 
i m not pouting  and stand up straight 
how often do i have to tell you 
and that s to be the king 
and i m to be his chancellor 
has he told you 
john will rule the country
while i run it  that is to say 
he gets to spend
the taxes that i raise 
how nice for you  it s
not as nice as being king 
we ve made you duke of
brittany  is that so little 
no one ever thinks of crown
and mentions geoff  why is that 
isn t being chancellor
power enough 
it s not the power i feel deprived
of  it s the mention i miss 
there s no affection
for me here 
you wouldn t think
i d want that  would you 
henry 
hmm 
i have a confession 
yeah 
  i don t much like
our children 
only you    the child i raised but
didn t bear  you never cared for me 
i did and do  believe me 
henry s bed is henry s province 
he can people it with sheep
for all i care 
which  on occasion 
he has done 
rosamund s been dead
for seven years 
two months and 18 days 
i never liked her much 
  you count the days 
  i made the numbers up 
he found miss clifford
in the mists of wales   
and brought her home
for closer observation 
liking what he found 
he scrutinized her many years 
he loved her deeply  and
she  him  and yet  my dear 
when henry had to choose
between his lady and my lands   
there is no sport in
hurting me  it s so easy 
after all the years
of loving care 
do you think i could
bring myself to hurt you 
eleanor  with both hands
tied behind you 
she is lovely  isn t she 
yes  very 
who could i have chosen
to love   
to gall you more 
there s no one 
time hasn t done a thing
but wrinkle you 
it hasn t even done that  i ve
borne six girls  five boys   
and 31 connubial years of you 
how am i possible  there
are moments when i miss you 
many  that s my wooly
sheepdog  do you doubt it 
so  wee johnny gets the crown 
i ve heard it rumored 
but i don t believe it 
losing alais will be hard 
for you do love her 
it s an old man s last
attachment  nothing more 
how hard do you find
living in your castle 
it was difficult in the
beginning  but that s past 
i find i ve seen
the world enough 
i ll never let you loose 
you led too many
civil wars against me 
and i damn near won the last one 
still  as long as i get trotted out   
for christmas courts and
state occasions now and then   
for i do like to see you   
it s enough 
i m famished 
let s go in to dinner 
arm in arm 
and hand in hand 
you re still a marvel of a man 
and you re my lady 
it s an odd thing  eleanor 
i ve fought and bargained
all these years   
as if the only thing i had to live
for was what happened after i was dead 
i ve something else
to live for now 
i ve blundered onto peace 
on christmas eve 
since louis died  while philip
grew  i ve had no france to fight 
in that lull  i ve found how
good it is to write a law   
or make a tax more fair
or sit in judgment to decide   
which peasant gets a cow 
i tell you  there is nothing
more important in the world 
now the french boy s big enough 
and i m sick of war 
do you still need
the vexin  henry 
it s as vital as it ever was  my troops
there are one day away from paris 
that s a march of 20 miles 
i must keep it 
henry  dear 
if alais does not marry richard 
i will see you lose the vexin 
well  i thought
you d never say it 
i can do it 
you can try 
we have a pack of barons we
should look the loving couple for 
can you read love in that 
and permanent affection 
my richard is the next king 
not your john 
i know you  henry  i know
every twist and bend you ve got 
and i ll be waiting
round each corner for you 
do you truly care who s king 
i care because
you care so much 
don t fight me  eleanor  what would you
have me do    give out  give up  give in 
give me a little peace 
a little 
why so modest  how about eternal
peace  now  there s a thought 
if you oppose me 
i ll strike you any way i can 
henry 
madam 
did you ever love me 
no 
good  that will
make this pleasanter 
well  i ve come 
i m here 
what was it you wanted 
just to talk 
we haven t been alone 
the two of us  in   
how long is it  lamb   
two years 
you look fit 
war agrees with you 
i keep informed  i follow all
your slaughters from a distance 
do sit down 
is this an audience  a good night
hug with kisses or an ambush 
let s hope it s a reunion 
must you look so stern 
i sent for you to say
i want your love again 
but i can t say it
to a face like that 
my love  of all things 
what would you want it for 
why  for itself  what
other purpose could i have 
you will tell me
when you re ready to 
i scheme a lot  i know 
i plot and plan 
that s how a queen
in prison spends her time 
but there is more to me
than that 
can t i say i love a son
and be believed 
if i were you 
i d try another tack 
i ve no dammed up floods of passion for
you  there s no chance i ll overflow 
you re a dull boy  dull as plainsong 
la la la  forever on one note 
i gave the church up out of
boredom  i can do as much for you 
you ll never give me up 
not while i hold the aquitaine 
you think i m motivated by love of hills
and dales  i think you want it back 
you re so deceitful  you can t
ask for water when you re thirsty 
we could tangle spiders
in the webs you weave 
if i m so devious 
why don t you go 
don t stand there
quivering in limbo 
love me  little lamb 
or leave me 
leave you  madam 
with pure joy 
departure s a simple act  you put the
left foot down  and then the right 
mother  hush  dear  mother s fighting 
father s finished working out
the treaty terms 
how nice 
where is your father 
ah  there you are 
well  have you
put the terms to philip 
not yet  but we re shortly granting him
an audience  i hope you ll all attend 
are we to know the terms 
or would you rather tease us 
not at all  the terms are    what are
you giving to philip  what of mine 
whatever you ve got goes to me  and
what s the nothing geoffrey gets 
my god  boys 
you can t all three be king 
all three of us can try 
that s pointless now 
i want you to succeed me 
richard 
alais and the crown   
i give you both 
i ve no sense of humor 
if i did  i d laugh 
  i mean to do it 
  what about me 
i m your favorite 
i m the one you love 
i m sorry  john 
i can t help myself 
could you keep anything i gave you 
could you beat him in the field 
you could 
john  i won t be there 
i m losing too 
all my dreams for you are lost 
you ve led me on 
i never meant to 
you re a failure as a father 
you know that  i m sorry  johnny 
not yet  but i ll do something
terrible  and you ll be sorry then 
did you rehearse all this 
or are you improvising 
good god  woman 
face the facts 
which ones 
we have so many 
power is the only fact 
how could i keep him
from the throne 
he d only take it
if i didn t give it to him 
no  you d make me fight for it 
i know you  you d never give me
anything  true  and i haven t 
you get alais and the kingdom 
but i get the thing i want most 
if you re king  england
stays intact  i get that 
it s all yours now    the crown 
the girl  the whole black business 
isn t that enough 
i don t know
who s to be congratulated 
kings  queens  knights everywhere
you look  and i m the only pawn 
i haven t got a thing to lose 
that makes me dangerous 
  poor child 
  poor john 
who says   poor john  
don t everybody sob at once 
my god  if i went up in flames 
there s not a living soul   
who d pee on me
to put the fire out 
let s strike a flint and see 
you re everything a little
brother dreams of  you know that 
  i used to dream about you all the time 
  ah  johnny 
i ll show you  eleanor 
i ve not lost yet 
well  mummy 
if you want me  here i am 
john s lost his chancellor 
has he  and you ve gained one 
it s a bitter thing
your mummy has to say 
she doesn t trust me  you must
know henry isn t through with john 
he ll keep the vexin till
the moon goes blue from cold 
and as for richard s wedding day   
we ll see the second coming first 
the needlework alone can
last for years 
i know 
you know i know 
i know you know i know 
we know henry knows 
and henry knows we know it 
we re a knowledgeable family 
will richard take me
for his chancellor or won t he 
why are you dropping john 
because you re going to win  you will 
with me to help you  i haven t yet 
i can handle john  he ll
swallow anything i tell him 
i ll take him by the hand and
walk him into the trap you set 
you re good 
you re first class  geoff 
you d sell john out to me 
or me to john  or   
you can tell me    have you found some
way of selling everyone to everybody 
not yet  mummy 
but i m working on it 
i don t care who s king 
but you and henry do 
i want to watch the two of you
go picnicking on one another 
you have a gift for hating 
you re the expert 
you should know 
dear lord 
you ve loved me
all these years 
oh  god forgive me  i ve upset
the queen  we need you  help us 
what    and miss the fun
of selling you 
be richard s chancellor 
rot 
well  that s how
deals are made 
we ve got him if we want him 
he ll sell us all  you know 
but only if he thinks
we think he won t 
why did i have to have
such clever children 
what s the matter  richard  nothing 
it s a heavy thing 
your nothing 
when i write or send for you
or speak or reach 
your nothings come 
like stones 
don t play a scene with me 
i wouldn t if i could 
i m simpler than i used to be 
i had  at one time 
many appetites 
i wanted poetry and power and the
young men who create them both 
i even wanted henry  too 
in those days 
now i ve only one desire left   
to see you king 
the only thing you want to see is
father s vitals on a bed of lettuce 
you don t care who wins  as long
as henry loses  you d do anything 
you are medea to the teeth 
only this is one son you won t use
for vengeance against your husband 
how my captivity has
changed you 
henry meant to hurt me 
he s hacked you up instead 
men coveted this talon once 
henry was 18 when we met 
and i was queen of france 
he came down from the north to
paris with a mind like aristotle s   
and a form like mortal sin 
we shattered the commandments
on the spot 
i spent three months annulling
louis  then in may  in spring 
not far from here 
we married   
young count henry
and his countess 
but in three years  time i was his
queen  and he was king of england 
done at 21    five years
your junior  general 
i can count  there was no thomas
beckett then  or rosamund   
no rivals  only me 
and then young henry came 
and you   
and all the other blossoms
in my garden 
yes  had i been sterile 
darling  i d be happier today 
is that designed to hurt me 
what a waste 
i ve fought with henry over who
comes next  whose dawn it is   
and which son gets the sunset 
and we ll never live to see it 
look at you 
i loved you more than henry 
and it s cost me everything 
what do you want 
i want us back the way we
were  no  that s not it 
all right  then 
i want the aquitaine 
that s the mother i remember 
we can win  i can get you alais 
i can make the marriage happen  but
i ve got to have the aquitaine to do it 
i must have it back  it s
mine  and i ll never give it up 
shall i write my will 
 to richard    everything  
would you believe me then 
where s paper  paper burns 
i love you 
you love nothing 
you re incomplete  the human
parts of you are missing 
you re as dead
as you are deadly 
don t leave me 
you were lovely once 
i ve seen the pictures 
don t you remember
how you loved me 
we were always hand in hand 
here s how it felt 
as hot and coarse as that 
this won t burn 
i ll scratch a will on this 
 to richard    everything  
mother 
remember how i
taught you numbers   
and the lute and poetry 
see  you do remember 
i taught you dancing  too 
and languages   
and all the music i knew and
how to love what s beautiful 
the sun was warmer then 
and we were every day together 
william  tell the french king
i ll see him in the parlor 
yes  my lord 
in half an hour 
half an hour  good 
of course  you know there s not
a word of truth to henry s terms 
if that s a warning  thank you 
what if it s an offer 
 what if  is
a game for scholars 
what if angels sat on pinheads 
what if i were king 
it s your game  geoff 
you play it 
john 
i made this for father 
all the pieces work 
it took months  i m not a fool 
i know  now  here s my plan 
i read three languages 
i ve studied law 
what plan 
we ve got to make a
deal with philip  why 
because you re out  and richard s
in  and what kind of deal 
a war  if we three join and fight
now  we can finish richard off 
you mean destroy him 
hmm 
and mother too 
and mother too 
now  do we do it  is it
on  i ve got to think 
you haven t time 
we are extra princes now 
you know where
extra princes go 
down 
well  does john want a war
or doesn t he 
do you  if john asks for your
soldiers  will he get them 
if john wants a war 
he s got one 
john  you hear that 
i m still thinking 
let me help  it s either
richard on the throne or you 
do you think we d win 
i know it 
henry 
but you don t understand  i would
appreciate a little quiet confidence 
i ve enough nits picking at me 
but you ve promised me to richard 
good god 
you don t think i meant it 
so that whole scene 
all you said to john   
you think i d ever give him up when i ve
mothered him and fathered him and babied him 
he s all i ve got  how often do you
people have to hear it    every supper 
should we start the soup with
who we love and who we don t 
i think you like passing me
from hand to hand 
what am i to you   
a collection plate 
or am i all you ve got 
like john 
i ve got to get
the aquitaine for john 
  i talk people  and you answer back in provinces 
  they get mixed up 
what s the aquitaine to eleanor  it s
not a province  it s a way to torture me 
that s why she spent the evening
wooing richard  wheezing on the coals 
she ll squeeze it out of him  my
god  i d have loved to eavesdrop 
 i taught you prancing  lamb 
and lute and flute    
that s marvelous 
it s absolutely me 
i thought as long as i was
coming down  i d bring them 
whatever are you giving me 
you re such a child 
you always ask 
 to henry  
heavy 
it s my tombstone 
eleanor  you spoil me 
i never could
deny you anything 
don t go  it nettles her
to see how much i need you 
you need me  henry  like a
tailor needs a tinker s dam 
oh  i know that look 
he s going to say he loves me 
like my life 
i talk that way
to keep her spirits up 
well  how d you do with
richard  did you break his heart 
you think he ought to
give me back the aquitaine 
i can t see why he shouldn t  after
all  i ve promised him the throne 
the boy keeps wondering
if your promises are any good 
there s no sense asking if the air s
good when there s nothing else to breathe 
exactly what i told him 
have you got it 
will he give it back 
no aquitaine for john 
i have to give him something 
isn t some agreement possible 
love  in a world where carpenters
get resurrected  anything is possible 
you bore him  damn it 
he s your son 
oh  heavens  yes 
280 days i bore him 
i recall them all 
you d only just found rosamund 
why her so damn particularly 
i ve found other women 
countless others 
what s your count 
let s have a tally of the
bedspreads you ve spread out on 
thomas beckett s 
that s a lie 
i know 
you still care what i do 
i want the aquitaine for john 
i want it  and i ll have it 
is that menace you re
conveying  is it to be torture 
will you boil me or stretch me   
which  or am i to be perforated 
i have the documents 
and you will sign 
how will you force me to    threats 
 sign or i refuse to feed you  
tears   oh  sign before
my heart goes crack  
i m like the earth  old man   
there isn t any way around me 
i adore you 
save your aching arches 
that road s closed 
i have an offer for you 
my dear 
a deal  a deal 
i give the richest province on
the continent to john for what 
you tell me 
mastermind  for what 
your freedom 
oh 
once johnny gets the aquitaine 
you re free  i ll let you out 
think  on the loose in london 
winters in provence 
impromptu trips to visit richard
anywhere he s killing people   
all that for a signature 
  you re good 
  i thought it might appeal  you always fancied traveling 
yes 
i even made poor louis
take me on crusade 
how s that for blasphemy 
i dressed my maids as amazons and
rode bare breasted halfway to damascus 
louis had a seizure  and i
damn near died of windburn 
but the troops were dazzled 
henry  i m against the wall 
to be a prisoner   
to be bricked in   
when you ve known the world   
i ll never know how i survived 
these ten years  henry 
have been unimaginable 
and now 
you offer me
the only thing i want   
if i give up   
the only thing i treasure 
sign the paper  and we ll
break the happy news 
the queen is free  john gets the
aquitaine  and richard marries alais 
yes  let s have it done 
i ll sign 
on one condition 
name it 
have the wedding now 
what s that 
why  i ve surprised you 
surely it s not sudden 
they ve been marching down the aisle
for 16 years  and that s a long walk 
john can be best man 
that s a laugh 
and you can give the bride
away  i want to watch you do it 
alais   
i can live without her 
and i thought you loved her  so i do 
thank god  you frightened me 
i was afraid this wouldn t hurt 
what a tragedy you are 
i wonder   
do you ever wonder   
if i slept with your father 
my father 
it s a lie 
but there are rumors 
don t you ever wonder 
is it rich  despising
me  is it rewarding  no 
then stop 
how 
it s what i live for 
i ll show you 
by christ  i will 
i ll do it 
where s a priest 
somebody dig me up a priest 
you 
fetch me a bishop 
get old durham 
he s just down the hall 
ask him to meet us in the
chapel  john  richard  geoffrey 
what s wrong  what s happened 
richard s getting married 
getting married  now 
he s getting married now 
i never cease to marvel at
the quickness of your mind 
you can t hurt me 
you bag of bile 
but you can  father 
why  because i say so 
my lord  the bishop s waiting in the
chapel  good  let s get this over with 
you ll make a lovely bride 
i wonder if i ll cry 
you sound as if you think
it s going to happen  i do 
he s only plotting  can t you
tell when henry s plotting 
not this time 
he ll never give me up 
you think i won t 
because you told me so 
you re not my helen  i won t fight
a war to save a face  we re done 
i don t believe you 
wait ten minutes 
please  richard  richard 
we re not

come on  it s lunacy 
i won t do it  i won t 
  lunacy  let me go  henry  richard  no 
  come on 
i won t say the words 
not one of them 
it makes no sense 
why give me up 
what do you get 
what are you gaining 
why  the aquitaine  of course 
what s that again 
your mother gets her freedom 
and i get the aquitaine 
that is the proposition 
isn t it  you did agree 
of course she did  i knew it  it
was all pretense  i believed it all 
i meant it all  no wedding 
there ll be no wedding 
but  my boy  look 
durham s waiting 
marry her  for my sake  it
isn t much to ask  never 
but i promised it to philip 
think of my position 
damn the wedding and to hell with
your position  you don t dare defy me

god s sake  speak up  do something 
make a threat  come on

for a wedding or the vexin back 
by god  you don t get either  it s no

yes  i was 
i fooled you  didn t i 
oh  god  but i do love
being king 
well  henry 
liege and lord 
what happens now 
i ve no idea 
i know i m winning  and i know i ll
win  but what the next move is   
you were scared  weren t you 
no 
i think you were 
i was  you mustn t play with
feelings  henry  not with mine 
it wasn t possible to lose you 
i must hold you dearer
than i thought 
you ve got your enigmatic face
on  what s your mood  i wonder 
pure delight 
i m locked up with my sons 
what mother does not
dream of that 
one thing 
yes 
may i watch you kiss her 
can t you ever stop 
i watch you every night 
i conjure it before i sleep 
leave it there 
my curiosity is intellectual 
i want to see
how accurate i am 
forget the dragon
in the doorway  come 
believe i love you  for i do 
believe i m yours forever 
for i am 
believe in my contentment
and the joy you give me 
and believe   
you want more 
i m an old man
in an empty place 
be with me 
how beautiful you make me 
what might solomon have sung
had he seen this 
i can t 
i d turn to salt 
i ve lost again 
i m done for this time 
well  there ll be
other christmases 
i d hang you from the nipples 
but you d shock the children 
they kissed sweetly 
didn t they 
i ll have him next time 
i can wait 
ah  there you are 
my comfort and my company 
we re locked in
for another year 
four seasons more 
what a desolation 
what a life s work 
is it too much 
be sure to squint
as you approach 
you may be blinded
by my beauty 
merry christmas 
is that why you re here   
to tell me that 
i thought you might be lonely 
here  chancellor 
try it on for size 
it s puzzling 
i remember my third birthday 
not just pictures
of the garden or the gifts 
but who did what to whom
and how it felt 
my memory stretches that far back 
but never once can i remember   
anything from you or father
warmer than indifference 
why is that 
i don t know 
that was not an easy question from me 
and i don t deserve and easy answer 
there are times i think we
loved none of our children 
still too easy 
don t you think 
i m weary  and you want
a simple answer 
and i haven t one 
i m so sick of all of you 
i thought i d come
and gloat a little 
mother s tired  come stick
pins tomorrow morning 
i ll be more responsive then 
it s no fun goading anyone
tonight  bastard s boxed us up 
what s that  dear  we re his
prisoners  if that interests you 
why should it 
i m his prisoner anyway 
it was    correct me
if i m wrong   
but it was my impression that
you wanted henry s throne for me 
we can t win  richard 
we ve lost it this time 
you think i m finished  do you  so i do 
i ve suffered more defeats
than you have teeth 
i know one
when it happens to me 
take your wormwood like a good
boy  swallow it and go to bed 
i will be king  so you
will  but not this year 
oh  leave it  richard 
let it go for now 
i can t 
it s not so hard 
try saying after me 
john wins  i lose 
and what if john died 
you wouldn t dare  a
knife  why wouldn t i 
he s got a knife  of course he
has a knife  he always has a knife 
we all have knives  it s
1183  and we re barbarians 
how clear we make it  oh  my
piglets  we are the origins of war 
not history s forces  nor the times 
nor justice  nor the lack of it 
nor causes  nor religions 
nor ideas 
nor kinds of government 
nor any other thing 
we are the killers 
we breed wars 
we carry it 
like syphilis  inside 
dead bodies rot in field and stream
because the living ones are rotten 
for the love of god  can t we
love one another just a little 
that s how peace begins 
we have so much
to love each other for 
we have such possibilities 
my children 
we could change the world 
and while we hugged each other 
what would philip do 
oh  good god  philip 
we re supposed to start a war  if
father finds out  i ll be ruined 
steady  john  don t panic 
some adviser you are 
don t do anything without me  let me
handle it  he s made a pact with philip 
you advised john into making
war  that fearless boy   
he s disinherited himself 
when henry finds out    when
i tell him what john s done   
i need a little time  can you keep
john from philip till i say so 
anything you say  richard  i want
you out of here before this breaks 
and that means philip 
go to him  be desperate 
promise anything   
the vexin  brittany 
once you re free and john is out
of favor  we ll make further plans 
you see philip  you re the diplomat 
you see him  you talk to him 
you re a friend 
you know him  i don t 
and richard 
promise anything 
i ve got the old boy this time 
the damn fool thinks he
loves john  he believes it 
that s where the knife
goes in   
knives 
knives 
where is that mirror  i m eleanor 
and i can look at anything 
my  what a lovely girl 
how could her king
have left her 
philip 
philip 
it s working out  by morning 
i can be the chosen son 
the crown can come to me  are you still
with me  we ll have to fight them all 
they ll band together once this
happens  have i got your word 
do i have yours  all england s
land in france if i support you 
are we allies then 
we were born to be 
i should say something solemn 
but i haven t the time 
i m off to father with news that
john s a traitor  after that   
you stink  you know that 
you re a stinker  and you stink 
i ll kill you 
ah 
lump 
if you re a prince  there s
hope for every ape in africa 
i had you saved  i wasn t on
my way to father  but he was 
he would have gone to henry and
betrayed you  look  it s in his face 
it s true  i don t know
who my friends are 
philip 
  may we 
  that s what tapestries are for 
i ll never learn 
i ll ruin everything 
richard 
hello  richard 
you re halfway to bed  i ll
wait for morning  come in 
mother sent me 
come in anyway 
our alchemists have stumbled
on the art of boiling burgundy 
it turns to steam  and when it
cools  we call it brandy wine 
i m henry s prisoner 
you find that charming 
no  then why the charming smile 
i thought  i can t think why 
of when you were in paris last 
can it be two whole years
ago  it can  i need an army 
it ll take the cold away 
i must have soldiers 
have i aged 
do i seem older to you 
they ve been two fierce years  i ve
studied  and i ve trained to be a king 
i ll have your answer    yes or
no  you ll have it when i give it 
you see 
i ve changed 
i m not the boy you taught to
hunt two years ago  remember 
racing after boar 
you flying first 
me scrambling after 
all day into dusk 
don t go  i must know  will you help me 
sit and we ll discuss it 
you never write 
to anyone 
why should i make you
king of england 
aren t i better off
with john or geoffrey 
why have you to fight when i
could have the cretin or the fiend 
would we fight  we re
fighting now  good night 
you re still a boy 
in some ways 
which way did you have in mind 
you haven t asked how much your
help is worth  you ll tell me 
you can have the vexin back 
and what else 
all of brittany  does that
matter  that s geoffrey s 
possibly to geoffrey  and what
else  that s all your help is worth 
and in return 
what do you want from me 
two thousand soldiers 
  and what else 
  five hundred knights on horse 
  and what else 
  arms and siege equipment 
  and what else 
  i never wrote because i thought you d never answer 
you got married 
does that make a difference  doesn t it 
i ve spent two years
on every street in hell 
that s odd 
i never saw you there 
you haven t said you loved me 
when the time comes 
shh 
it s not too late at night 
i d hoped you d come 
good 
we couldn t leave negotiations
where they were 
ah 
i keep looking for your
father in you  he s not there 
i ll miss him 
has richard or the queen
been here to see you 
does it matter  if they
haven t yet  they will 
i want to reach a settlement  i
left you with too little earlier 
yes 
nothing is too little 
i m sorry
you re not fonder of me  lad 
your father always said 
 be fond of stronger men  
no wonder he loved everyone 
i ve come to you
to offer peace 
piss on your peace 
your father would have wept 
my father was a weeper 
fight me  and you ll lose 
i can t lose  henry 
i have time 
why  just look at you 
great heavy arms  but each
year they get a little heavier 
the sand goes pit pat
in the glass 
i m in no hurry  henry 
i ve got time 
suppose i hurry things along  suppose i
say that england is at war with france 
then france surrenders  i
don t have to fight to win 
take all you want    this county 
that one  you won t keep it long 
what kind of courage
have you got 
the tidal kind   
it comes and goes 
by god  i d love to turn you
loose on eleanor  more brandy wine 
you recognize it  they were boiling
it in ireland before the snakes left 
well  things look a little bleak
for henry  don t they 
you ll say yes to richard when he
comes    arms  soldiers  anything he asks 
i d be foolish not to 
yeah 
and withdraw it all before the battle
ever started  wouldn t you  in my place 
why fight henry when his sons
will do it for you 
yes  exactly 
  you ve got promise  lad  that s
first class thinking    thank you  sir 
good night  good night  you re
going  we haven t settled anything 
we open christmas presents at noon 
till then  you can t be finished with me 
oh  but i am  it s been most
satisfactory  what s so satisfactory 
winning is  i did just
win  surely you noticed 
not a thing  you
haven t won a damn thing 
hmm 
i found out the way your mind
works and the kind of man you are 
i know your plans
and expectations 
you ve burbled every bit
of strategy you ve got 
i know exactly what you will do
and exactly what you won t 
and i ve told you
exactly nothing 
to these aged eyes  boy  that s
what winning looks like  dormez bien 
you   
you made my father nothing 
you were always better 
you bullied him 
you bellied with his wife 
you beat him down in every war 
you twisted every treaty 
you played mock the monk 
and then you made him
love you for it 
i was there 
his last words went to you 
he was a loving man  and you ve
learned nothing of it 
i learned how much fathers
live in sons 
a king like you has policy
prepared on everything 
what s the official line
on sodomy 
how stands the crown
on boys who do with boys 
richard finds his way
into so many legends 
let s hear yours
and see how it compares 
he found me first
when i was 15 
we were hunting 
it was nearly dark 
my horse fell  i was thrown 
i woke to richard touching me 
he asked me if i loved him 
 philip  do you love me  
and i told him   yes  
do you know why i told him yes 
so that one day i could
tell you all about it 
you cannot imagine
what that  yes  cost 
imagine snuggling
to a chancred whore   
and bending back your lips into
something like a smile  saying 
 yes 
 i love you 
 and i find you   
beautiful  
i don t know how i did it 
  no  it wasn t like that 
  but it was 
you loved me 
never 
get out  please 
i don t want you here 
it s no great pleasure
to be here 
so the royal corkscrew
finds me twisted  does he 
i ll go tell your mother  she ll
be pleased  she knows  she sent me 
how completely hers you are 
you ve had four sons 
who do you claim 
not henry 
not my buried brother 
not that monument to muck 
that epic idiot 
why him  why always him and never me 
he was the eldest 
he came first 
christ  henry  is that all 
you went with eleanor 
you never called me 
you never said my name 
i d have walked  i d have
crawled  i d have done anything 
it s not my fault 
i won t be blamed 
i only wanted you 
no  my crown  you want my
kingdom  you keep your kingdom 
that i will 
i hope it kills you 
thank god i have another son 
thank god for john 
and who shall we thank for
geoffrey  you don t think much of me 
 much   i don t think
of you at all 
nurse used to say
i had your hands 
i might have had more of you 
try seeing me 
i haven t richard s military skill 
but he was here betraying you  not i 
i haven t john s    god knows what you
see in john    and he s betrayed you too 
you think i d ever
make you king 
you ll make me king
because i m all you ve got 
i was to be his chancellor 
ask him why  i ve heard enough 
for moving john to treason 
i don t doubt he offered 
i don t doubt you tried 
and i don t doubt
john loves me 
like a glutton loves his lunch 
you turd 
well  john 
it isn t what you think 
what do i think 
what geoffrey said  i wouldn t
plot against you  ever 
i know 
you re a good boy 
can i go now  please  it s
late  i ought to be in bed 
couldn t you wait  couldn t
you trust me  it was all yours 
couldn t you believe that 
will you listen to the grief 
who do you think i built
this kingdom for  me 
daddy did it all for me 
when can i have it  daddy 
not until we bury you 
  i loved you 
  you re a cold and bloody bastard  you are 
and you don t love anything 
i m it 
i m all that s left 
here  father 
here i am 
my life  when it is written 
will read better than it lived 
henry fitz empress  first
plantagenet  a king at 21 
the ablest soldier
of an able time 
he led men well  he cared
for justice when he could   
and ruled  for 30 years  a state
as great as charlemagne s 
he married out of love
a woman out of legend 
not in alexandria or rome or
camelot has there been such a queen 
she bore him many children 
but no sons 
king henry had no sons 
he had three whiskered things 
but he disowned them 
you re not mine 
we re not connected 
i deny you 
none of you will get my kingdom 
i leave you nothing 
and i wish you plague  may all
your children breech and die 
my boys are gone 
i ve lost my boys 
you dare to damn me  do you 
well  i ll damn you back 
goddamn you 
my boys are gone 
i ve lost my boys 
oh  jesus 
all my boys 
henry 
the christmas wine
is in the pot
the christmas coals are red
i ll spend my day
the lover s way
unwrapping all my gifts
in bed
the christmas mass
is over now
the christmas prayers are done
no one else is caroling 
it might as well be lent 
when i was little  christmas was
a time of great confusion to me 
the holy land had two kings   
god and uncle raymond 
i never knew whose birthday
we were celebrating 
henry isn t here  good  we
can talk behind his back 
what happened 
don t you know 
there was a scene with beds and
tapestries  and many things got said 
spiced wine 
i d forgotten henry liked it 
may i stay 
it s your room just as much as
mine  we re both in residence 
packed in like the poor 
three to a bed 
did you love henry   
ever 
ever  back before the flood 
as long ago as rosamund 
ah  that s prehistory  lamb  there
are no written records or survivors 
there are pictures  she was
prettier than you  oh  much 
her eyes  in certain light  were
violet  and all her teeth were even 
that s a rare  fair feature   
even teeth 
she smiled to excess  but she
chewed with real distinction 
and you hate her even now 
no  but i did 
he put her in my place  you see 
and that was very hard 
like you  she headed henry s
table  that s my chair 
and so you had her poisoned 
no  i never poisoned rosamund 
oh  i prayed for her to drop   
and smiled a little
when she did 
why aren t you happy 
henry s keeping you  you
must be cleverer than i am 
i ve tried feeling pity
for you 
but it keeps on turning
into something else 
why pity 
you love henry  but you
love his kingdom too 
you look at him 
and you see cities 
acreage  coastline  taxes 
all i see is henry 
leave him to me  can t you 
i left him years ago 
and i thought i could move you 
were you always like this 
when i was young and worshipped
you  is this what you were like 
most likely 
child  i m finished  and i ve come
to give him anything he asks for 
do you know what i
should like for christmas 
i should like
to see you suffer 
alais  just for you 
alors  ma petite 
j ai peur  maman 
no  no 
the sky is pocked with stars 
what eyes the wise men must have
had to see a new one in so many 
you look cold  i ve mulled some wine 
i wonder   
were there fewer stars then 
i don t know  i fancy
there s a mystery in it 
what s this 
warm wine 
why  so it is 
you are as beautiful
as i remembered 
off you go 
my widow wants to see me 
she came to find out what
your plans are  i know 
she wants you back 
go to your room 
so  you want me back 
she thinks i do 
she thinks the need
for loving never stops 
she has a point 
i marvel at you 
after all these years 
still like a democratic drawbridge 
going down for everybody 
at my age  there s not
much traffic anymore 
to your interminable health 
  well  wife  what s on your mind 
  i ve just seen richard 
splendid boy 
he says you fought 
we always do 
it s his impression that
you mean to disinherit them 
i fancy i ll relent 
don t you 
i don t much care 
in fact  i wonder  henry 
if i care for anything 
i wonder if i m hungry
out of habit 
i could listen to you lie
for hours 
so your lust is rusty 
gorgeous 
henry  i m so tired 
sleep then  sleep and
dream of me with croutons 
henri a la mode 
  henry  stop it 
  eleanor  i haven t started 
what do you want  you want my
name on paper  i ll sign anything 
you want the aquitaine
for john  it s john s 
it s his  it s yours  it s
anybody s  in exchange for what 
for nothing 
for a little quiet 
for an end to this 
for god s sake 
sail me back to england 
lock me up   
and lose the key
and let me be alone 
you have my oath 
i give my word 
oh  well 
well  well 
would you like a pillow 
footstool  how about a shawl 
your oaths are all profanities  your words a
curse  your name on paper is a waste of pulp 
i m vilifying you  for
god s sake  pay attention 
how 
from where we started 
did we ever reach
this christmas 
step by step 
what happens to me now 
that s lively curiosity
from such a dead cat 
if you want to know
my plans  just ask me 
conquer china  sack the
vatican  or take the veil 
i m not among the ones
who give a damn 
just let me sign my lands
to john and go to bed 
no  you re too kind 
i can t accept 
come on  man  i ll sign the thing
in blood or spit or bright blue ink 
let s have it done 
let s not 
no  i don t think i want
your signature on anything 
you don t 
dear god 
the pleasure i still get
from goading you 
you don t want john to have
my provinces  bull s eye 
i can t bear you when
you re smug  i know  i know 
you don t want richard  and you
don t want john  you ve grasped it 
all right  then  shatter me 
let me have it 
what do you want 
a new wife 
oh 
so 
i m to be annulled 
well  will the pope annul me 
do you think 
the pontiff owes me one
pontificate  i think he will 
out eleanor 
in alais 
  why 
  a new wife  wife  will bear me sons 
that is the single thing   
of which i would have thought
you had enough 
i want a son 
we could populate   
a country town with country
girls who ve borne you sons 
how many is it 
help me count the bastards 
all my sons are bastards 
you really mean to do it 
lady love  with all my heart 
your sons are part of you 
like warts and goiters 
and i m having them removed 
we ve made them 
they re our boys 
i know  and good god 
look at them 
geoffrey   
there s a masterpiece 
he isn t flesh  he s a device 
he s wheels and gears 
and johnny   
was his latest treason
your idea 
i caught him lying 
and i ve said   he s young  
i found him cheating  and
i ve said   he s just a boy  
i ve watched him steal and whore and
whip his servants  and he s not a child 
he s the man we made him 
don t share john with me 
he s your accomplishment 
and richard s yours 
how could you send him off
to deal with philip 
i was tired 
i was busy 
they were friends 
eleanor  he was the best 
from the cradle on  you cradled
him  i never had a chance 
you never wanted one  how
do you know  you took him 
separation from your husband
you could bear  but not your son 
whatever i have done 
you made me do 
you threw me out of bed
for richard 
not until you threw me out
for rosamund 
it s not that simple  i won t
have it to be that simple 
i adored you 
never 
i still do 
of all the lies 
that one is the most terrible 
i know  that s why
i saved it up for now 
oh  henry  we ve mangled
everything we ve touched 
deny us what you will 
we have done that 
do you remember when we met 
down to the hour
and color of your stockings 
i could hardly see you
for the sunlight 
it was raining  but no matter 
there was very little talk 
as i recall 
very little 
i had never seen such beauty 
i walked right up
and touched it 
god  where did i find
the gall to do that 
in my eyes 
i loved you 
no annulment 
what  there will be no annulment 
will there not  no  i m afraid
you ll have to do without 
well  it was just a whim 
i m so relieved 
i didn t want to lose you 
out of curiosity  as
intellectual to intellectual 
how in the name of bleeding
jesus can you lose me 
do we ever see each other 
am i ever near you 
ever with you  am i ever
anywhere but somewhere else 
do i write 
do we send messages 
do dinghies bearing gifts float up
the thames to you  are you remembered 
you are 
you re no part of me  we
do not touch at any point 
how can you lose me 
can t you feel the chains 
you know me well enough
to know i can t be stopped 
i don t have to stop you 
i have only to delay you 
every enemy you have has friends
in rome  we ll cost you time 
what is this 
i m not moldering 
my paint s not peeling  i m
good for years  how many years 
suppose i hold you back for one 
i can  it s possible 
suppose your first son dies 
ours did  it s possible 
suppose you re daughtered next 
we were 
that  too  is possible 
how old is daddy then 
what kind of spindly 
rickett ridden  milky 
wizened  dim eyed 
gammy handed  limpy line
of things will you beget 
it s sweet of you to care 
and when you die  which is
regrettable but necessary 
what will happen to frail alais
and her pruney prince 
you can t think richard s going
to wait for your grotesque to grow 
you wouldn t let him
do a thing like that 
let him  i d push him
through the nursery door 
you re not that cruel 
don t fret  we ll wait
until you re dead to do it 
eleanor  what do you want 
just what you want   
a king for a son 
you can make more  i can t 
you think i want to disappear 
one son is all i ve got  and you
can blot him out and call me cruel 
for these ten years  you ve
lived with everything i ve lost   
and loved another woman
through it all  and i am cruel 
i could peel you like a pear 
and god himself
would call it justice 
i will die sometime soon 
one day i ll duck too slow 
and at westminster 
they ll sing out  long live
the king  for someone else 
i beg you  let it be
a son of mine 
i am not moved to tears 
i have no sons  you have too
many sons  you don t need more 
well  wish me luck 
i m off 
to rome  that s where
they keep the pope 
you don t dare go 
say that again at noon 
you ll say it to my horse s ass 
lamb  i ll be rid of you by easter 
you can count your reigning days 
you go to rome 
we ll rise against you 
who will  richard  geoffrey 
john and eleanor of aquitaine 
the day those stout hearts band
together is the day that pigs get wings 
there ll be pork in the treetops
come morning 
don t you see you ve given them
a common cause  new sons 
you leave the country 
and you ve lost it 
  all of you at once 
  and philip too  he d join us 
yes  he would 
now how s your trip to rome 
oh  i ve got you 
got you  got you 
should i take a thousand
men at arms  or is that showy 
bluff away 
ah  poor thing  how can i break
the news  you ve just miscalculated 
have i  how 
you should have lied  you should have
promised to be good while i was gone 
i would have let your three boys
loose  they could have fought me then 
you wouldn t keep your sons
locked up here 
why the devil wouldn t i 
you wouldn t dare 
why not  let them sit in
chinon for a while  i forbid it 
she forbids it  did your father
sleep with me  or didn t he 
no doubt you re going to tell me
that he did  would it upset you 
what about the thousand men  i
say be gaudy and to hell with it 
don t leave me  henry  i m at rock
bottom  i ll do anything to keep you 
i think you think you
mean it  ask for something 
eleanor  we re passed it  years

there isn t one  about my
fornication with your father 
yes  there is  you can expire  you first 
old man  i only hope i m there to watch 
you re so afraid of dying  you re
so scared of it  ah  poor eleanor 
if only she d lied  she did  she
said she never loved your father 
i can always count on you 
i never touched you without
thinking   geoffrey  geoffrey  
the day you hurt me 
i ll cry out 
i ve put more horns on you
than louis ever wore 
am i supposed to care 
i ll kill you if you leave me 
you can try  i loved your
father s body  he was beautiful

body now  shall i describe it 
eleanor  i hope you die

i m having eleanor annulled 
the nation will be shocked to learn
our marriage wasn t consummated 
oh  be serious

it seems that you and i
are getting married 
by the pope himself 
you mean it 
shall i kneel 
it s not another trick  the bridal
party s drilling on the cobblestones 
  she ll find a way to stop us 
  how  she won t be here 
we re launching her for salisbury
tower when the winds change 
she ll be barging down
the river by lunchtime 
if she doesn t stop us 
richard will 
not anymore  i ve corked him up  he s in
the cellar with his brothers and the wine 
the royal boys are aging with the
royal port  you haven t said yes 
would you like
a formal declaration 
there  my finest angle 
it s on all the coins 
sad alais  will you marry me 
be my queen 
we ll love each other 
and you ll give me sons 
let s have six  we ll
do eleanor one better 
we ll call the first one
louis  if you like 
louis le premier  how s
that for a king of england 
henry  you can t ever
let them out 
you ve lost me  let who out  your sons 
you ve put them in the dungeon  and
you ve got to keep them there forever 
do i now  if they re free when you die 
it s the dungeon
or the nunnery for me 
but  henry 
what about the child 
don t bother me about the child 
the damn thing isn t born yet 
if they re free 
they ll kill it 
and i will not live to see
our children murdered 
henry 
are you going down 
to let them out
or to keep them in 
could you say
to a child of yours 
 you ve seen the sunlight
for the last time  
can you do it  henry 
i shall have to 
shan t i 
he s here 
he ll get no satisfaction out of
me  he isn t going to see me beg 
why  you chivalric fool  as if
the way one fell down mattered 
when the fall is all there is 
it matters 
my barge is sailing
with the tide 
  i ve come to say good bye 
  does henry know you re here 
i ve brought you each a little
something  what s he planning 
is he going to keep us here  for god s
sake  mother  i picked it out especially 
  how heavy is the outside guard 
  that s taken care of 
the courtyard  the gates  they re putting
henry s train together  and it s chaos 
you can walk right out  we ll go
to poitiers  he ll expect that 
but we ll meet him with an army
when he comes  you stick close to me 
when you run  run hard  why run
at all  i think we ought to stay 
stay here  till henry comes 
he will come  won t he 
and he ll come alone 
i count three knives to
one  you think we could 
i d only do it wrong 
you kill him  i ll watch 
  where are you going 
  up for air 
don t stop her  you don t
think i m gonna let this happen 
if you tell  there ll be a rash of
executions  and you don t want that 
no  you don t want to lose
one of us  not even me 
you re clever  but i
wonder if you re right 
warn him  it s the end of us  you
warn him not  it s the end of him 
it s that clear 
take the knives and run 
no  geoffrey s right 
you re not an assassin 
look again 
richard 
spare me that  you brought these
things  you want him dead  you do it 
you unnatural animal 
unnatural  mummy  you tell
me  what s nature s way 
if poison mushrooms grow and
babies come with crooked backs 
if goiters thrive
and dogs go mad   
and wives kill husbands 
what s unnatural 
come  here stands your lamb  come
cover him in kisses  he s all yours 
no  you re not mine 
i m not responsible 
where do you think i learned this
from  who do you think i studied under 
how old was i when you fought with
henry first  young  i don t know 
how many battles did i watch  but those
were battles  not a knife behind a door 
i never heard a corpse ask how it got so cold 
what were you thinking when you fought him 
you  i did it all for you 
of your unnatural animal 
you wanted father dead 
no  never that 
you tried to kill him 
why  what did you want  yes 
i wanted henry back 
liar 
i wanted henry 
don t trust her  she ll
warn him if she gets a chance 
dear  dear  whatever
shall we do with mother 
it wants light 
what we do in dungeons
needs the shades of day 
i stole the candles
from the chapel 
jesus won t begrudge them 
and the chaplain works for me 
you look dreadful 
so do you 
i underslept a little 
we can all rest
in a little while 
there  that s better 
bright and clear 
just like the morning 
fine looking boy 
what do you want from us 
you must be mad 
why did you have to come here 
damn it  why did you come 
you were the best 
i told her so 
you  i loved 
you re going to keep us here 
you can t ever let me out 
you know you can t 
i ll never stop 
i can t stop either 
brave boys   
that s what i have 
come for me 
what s wrong 
you re richard  aren t you 
but you re henry 
please  take me back 
can t we try again 
again 
we always have before 
oh  yes  we always have 
go on

they re assassins  aren t they 
this was treason  wasn t it 
you gave them life

who s to say it s monstrous 
i m the king  i call it just 
therefore  i  henry 
by the grace of god 
king of the english  lord of
scotland  ireland and wales 
count of anjou  brittany 
poutou and normandy 
maine  gascony and aquitaine 
do sentence you to death

what i intended 
children

go on 
i m done 
i m finished with you 
you and i are finished 
you spare the rod 
you ll spoil those boys 
i couldn t do it  eleanor 
nobody thought you could 
come rest 
i want no women in
my life  you re tired 
i could have conquered europe 
all of it 
but i had women in my life 
go on  get out

i should have
killed you years ago 
you put me here  you made me
do mad things  you ve bled me 
shoulder it yourself 
don t put it on my back 
pick it up and carry it 
i can 
my losses are my work 
what losses 
i m the one with nothing 
lost your life s work 
have you 
provinces are nothing 
land is dirt 
i could take defeats like
yours and laugh  i ve done it 
if you re broken 
it s because you re brittle 
i ve lost 
you won 
and i can t ever
have you back again 
you re all
that i have ever loved 
christ  you don t know
what nothing is 
  i want to die 
  no  you don t 
  i want to die 
  i ll hold you 
henry  i want to die 
eleanor 
i want to die 
let me hold you 
i want to die 
you will  you know  someday 
just wait long enough 
and it ll happen 
so it will 
we re in the cellar 
you re going back to prison 
my life is wasted 
we ve lost each other 
and you re smiling 
it s the way
i register despair 
there s everything in life
but hope 
we re both alive 
and for all i know 
that s what hope is 
we re jungle creatures  henry 
and the dark is all around us 
see them   
in the corners 
you can see the eyes 
and they can see ours 
i m a match for anything 
aren t you 
i should have been
a great fool   
not to love you 
you ll let me out for easter 
come the resurrection 
you can strike me down again 
perhaps next time i ll do it
