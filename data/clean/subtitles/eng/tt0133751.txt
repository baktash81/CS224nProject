that little zekey boy
do you even know
where she is
europe sri lanka japan i wonder what
remote location she went to this week
to hide from her
great big bastard mistake
ive taken your shit
for too fucking long
you dickless druginduced
excuse for a human being
whoa woman what are you on
woman did you just say woman
im sick of you
little boy
and if i see you peddling
your wonder dust again
im gonna shove my foot
so far up your ass
youll be sucking my toes
till graduation
bystanders murmuring
girls
big trouble oh wow
she got some bad shit
and then they chased us
but we got away
all this started when mrs brummel
did a wet and wild
in the boys locker room
casey  i think so
everybodys been acting really strange
especially the faculty
tell me about it its like theyve
all turned into fucking pod people
or something
into what people
invasion of the body snatchers
a small town was taken over by aliens
that was a joke
look what if it
really happened
what if that really happened
i think somethings
taking over our school
the body snatchers is a story
somebody made up dingus
its located in the fiction
section of the library
so is schindlers list all fiction
is based on some truth right
what does miss burke teach us
in english 101 write what you know
how do we know
this writer guy
jack finney
didnt encounter aliens
in his high school
which led him to write a book
about an alien invasion
your conspiracy theory is flawed
how so
jack finneys the body snatchers
is a blatant ripoff
of the puppet masters
by robert heinlein
so you can completely disregard
that entire work
whatever
the point is theyre here
theyve been here
and theyre here again
you know casey i think youve
been racked into the flagpole
one too many times
look how do you know
theres not a conspiracy
maybe xfiles is right
where do all these movies
come from anyway
how do we know spielberg
lucas sonnenfeld
emmerich havent been
visited by aliens
you know maybe theyre
aliens themselves
maybe theyre simply preparing us
for whats to come
you know what casey
its fiction okay
its science fiction
exactly
everybody gets hung up on the science
part which has nothing to do with it
theyre getting at us
through the fiction
so aliens have just been
setting us up over the years
creating this happy little
makebelieve existence
with their et
and their men ln black movies
just so that nobody would believe it
if it really happened
i think so
yeah
youre not buying this are you
no im not
tapping table
but its kind of cool
okay so whats missing
well in the body snatchers
they were pods but where are they
i mean where are the pods
there are no pods
theres gotta be
something else
in puppet masters
they were parasites
i filled stan in
come with us stokelys
onto something
really
shit
door closes
stokely  furlong must have sent it
up to the university
doubtful
where else could it be
sighs
what what is it
will someone please tell me
what the hells going on here
it all started yesterday when
i found this thing this new species
which is now missing
we think aliens are
taking over our school
laughing
right come on
you saw what brummel
did in the shower
delilah  i saw her dead body
in the closet
theyve been calling students
into the office the students
with the most influence on down
including the new team captain
looks like you picked
the right week to quit football
you think aliens have
infested our school
that would explain their weird
behaviour wouldnt it
give me a fucking break
so what are we
doing in here
shopping

casey  wheres your mom and dad
zeke  europe i think
oh shit
oh my god
stan  this is some serious shit
chuckles  this is your big secret
caffeine pills
you didnt see that
delilah  what are we gonna do with
the police not being an option
stan  i can call my dad
hed know what to do
if hes even
your dad anymore
its called a gun man
what is it
were gonna find out
hey come here oscar
come here buddy
jeez
now what
im sorry buddy
sudden crack
sighs
see its a parasite
it attaches itself to a host
and then it controls it
its incomplete
what do you mean
it can survive on its own but its
really part of a greater organism
look it has the ability to replicate
but it needs a host
something moist
see what it did to oscars insides
it dried them out
stan  hey isnt a human body
composed mainly of water
theyre using us
drying us out
like mrs brummel right
casey
i overheard the coach
her body was too old
she didnt take
see this partially explains
what happened to furlong
that drugs a diuretic
dries it out kills it
theyre using us as hosts theyre just
turning us into mindless slaves
they can control
how do you know that
she doesnt
shes a trekkie scifi freak
whos been right so far
how do we stop it
yeah stokely
this is your area
in theory
theyre all connected
if we kill the master
we get them all
ln theory
what happens to everybody else
the ones whove been taken over
do they just die
no they dont
they would become human again
but that is
in theory so
so if we found the leader
and killed it
wed beat it
what are we even talking about
i say we get the fuck out of town
casey  and go where
dont you see we got to stop it
or its gonna spread
it took the high school
in a day and a half
give it a week
well never outrun it
we have to fight
stan  fight what
we dont even know
whos alien and whos not
what if one of us was an alien
right now how would we know
hes right how do i know
youre really casey
how do i know
youre really you
in body snatchers
humans became emotionless
they completely lost their identities
stan  the coach had emotion
i mean hes usually a real hardass
but he was different somehow
his behaviour
was slightly odd
like a star quarterback who mysteriously
quits the football team
scoffs
what are you doing delilah
im just pointing out
your slightly odd behaviour stan

the last couple of days
im not an alien

people who are just like her

quit screwing around
female reporter  as you
can see life has returned
to normal at herrington high
after the mysterious disappearance of
several faculty members one month ago
both the local authorities and
the fbi have largely discounted
several students claim
that an extraterrestrial was involved
a spokesperson for the fbi
has indicated
that no substantiating evidence
has been found
that goes for you too zeke
just cause youre the new guy doesnt
mean were gonna cut you any slack
put that butt out
and get in there
male reporter
now bring that camera over here
when do you think theyre
gonna find a new story
havent they milked our little
high school invasion to death
female reporter  although
there has been no evidence of foul play
the criminal investigation
is ongoing
no regrets
none whatsoever
she comes up and over time
like a thousand times before
im dropping out and faded
but i keep on wanting more
so how does it feel
to be a hero
its all right i guess
i dont know its
its over now
different
male reporter
thats him over there hey casey
delilah

students laughing
chattering
one way out
ls all youre ever
gonna get from
those wholl hand it out
dont ever let it upset you
cause theyll put words
into your mouths
theyre making you
feel so ashamed
theyre making you
take all the blame
theyre making you cold
in the night
theyre making you question
your heart and your soul
and i think that
its not quite right
hey stay young
and invincible
cause we know
just what we are and
come what may
were unstoppable
cause we know
just what we are
yeah we know
just what we are
yeah we know
just what we are
theyll put words
into my mouth
theyre making me
feel so ashamed
theyre making me
take all the blame
theyre making me
cold in the night
theyre making me question
my heart and soul
and i think that
its not quite right
hey stay young
and invincible
cause we know
just what we are and
come what may
were unstoppable
cause we know
just what we are
yeah we know
just what we are
we know just what we are
i watch the ripples
change their size
but never leave the stream
of warm impermanence and
so the days
float through my eyes
but the days
still seem the same
and these children
that you spit on
as they try
to change their worlds
are immune
to your consultation
theyre quite aware of what
theyre going through
chchchchchanges
turn and face
the strange
chchchanges
dont tell them to grow up
and out of it
chchchchchanges
turn and face
the strange
chchchanges
wheres your shame
youve left us
up to our necks in it
time may change me
but you cant trace time
strange fascination
fascinating me
changes are taking
the pace im going through
chchchchchanges
turn and face
the strange
chchchanges
look out all you
rock and rollers
chchchchchanges
turn and face
the strange
chchchanges
pretty soon youre gonna
get a little older
time may change me
but i cant trace time
i said that
time may change me
