crusoe s afraid that he d be
stuck on that island forever   
with nothing but calluses 
    classmates chuckle  
    teacher   no  that s not correct 
isolation
was his greatest fear 
yes  but   
his external existence
in no way compared   
to the internal agony
of the loneliness he felt 
that s very good 
  like i said  calluses 
    classmates chuckle  
  girl   so cathy tells me one thing 
and then liz says another   
and then  of course 
jenny s got her own story 
so which one
do you want me to print

stan  you re good at football 
stick to what you re good at 
yeah  i ve always been good
at football and basketball
and every other sport i try

can the unified state offer the benefits
of power order and security

  olson   luckily  she carries
her medicine in her bag

we think it was brought on
by this terrible cold she s had

great big bastard mistake 
i ve taken your shit
for too fucking long 
you dickless drug induced
excuse for a human being 
  whoa  woman  what are you on 
   woman   did you just say   woman  
i m sick of you 
little boy 
and if i see you peddling
your wonder dust again 
i m gonna shove my foot
so far up your ass   
you ll be sucking my toes
till graduation 
  bystanders murmuring  
  girls  
big trouble  oh  wow 
she got some bad shit 
and then they chased us 
but we got away 
all this started when mrs brummel
did a wet and wild   
  in the boys  locker room 
    casey   i think so 
everybody s been acting really strange 
especially the faculty 
tell me about it  it s like they ve
all turned into fucking pod people   
  or something 
  into what people 
invasion of the body snatchers 
a small town was taken over by aliens 
that was a joke 
look  what if it
really happened 
  what if that really happened 
  i think something s
taking over our school 
the body snatchers is a story
somebody made up  dingus 
it s located in the fiction
section of the library 
so is schindler s list  all fiction
is based on some truth  right 
what does miss burke teach us
in english 101  write what you know 
how do we know
this writer guy   
  jack finney 
  didn t encounter aliens
in his high school   
which led him to write a book
about an alien invasion 
  your conspiracy theory is flawed 
  how so 
jack finney s the body snatchers
is a blatant rip off   
of the puppet masters
by robert heinlein 
so you can completely disregard
that entire work 
whatever 
the point is they re here 
they ve been here
and they re here again 
you know  casey  i think you ve
been racked into the flagpole
one too many times 
look  how do you know
there s not a conspiracy 
maybe x files is right 
where do all these movies
come from anyway 
how do we know spielberg 
lucas  sonnenfeld 
emmerich haven t been
visited by aliens 
you know  maybe they re
aliens themselves 
maybe they re simply preparing us
for what s to come 
you know what  casey 
it s fiction  okay 
  it s science fiction 
  exactly 
everybody gets hung up on the science
part  which has nothing to do with it 
they re getting at us
through the fiction 
so  aliens have just been
setting us up over the years 
creating this happy little
make believe existence   
with their e t 
and their men ln black movies   
just so that nobody would believe it
if it really happened 
i think so 
yeah 
  you re not buying this  are you 
  no  i m not 
  tapping table  
but it s kind of cool 
okay  so what s missing 
well  in the body snatchers 
they were pods  but where are they 
i mean  where are the pods 
there are no pods 
there s gotta be
something else 
in puppet masters 
they were parasites 
  i filled stan in 
  come with us  stokely s
onto something 
really 
shit 
  door closes  
  stokely   furlong must have sent it
up to the university 
  doubtful 
  where else could it be 
    sighs  
  what  what is it 
will someone please tell me
what the hell s going on here 
it all started yesterday when
i found this thing  this new species 
which is now missing 
we think aliens are
taking over our school 
  laughing  
right  come on 
you saw what brummel
did in the shower 
  delilah   i saw her dead body
in the closet 
they ve been calling students
into the office  the students
with the most influence on down 
including the new team captain 
looks like you picked
the right week to quit football 
you think aliens have
infested our school 
that would explain their weird
behaviour  wouldn t it 
give me a fucking break 
so  what are we
doing in here 
shopping 
  i ve got a very large grocery list 
  what are you talking about 
this is where
i get my equipment 
you borrow it
from science labs 
i like to think of it
as stealing  actually 
    giggles  
  just doing my part to
the deconstruction of america 
so if anybody
finds us in here 
just grab ahold of me and pretend
we re making out 
the punishment
will be less severe 
  i don t need
an education  
  i learned all i need
from you  
  they ve got me
on some medication   
    stan   aliens 
    casey   do you have
a better explanation  stan 
  stan   great  just listen
to yourselves  our teachers are aliens 
  shh 
    stan   that s not weird 
that s fucking psychotic 
come on  guys

then leave  stan  why are you
hanging around  go win a pulitzer 
blow me  delilah 
 cause i m sick of your shit 
  get the fuck out of here and

  fuck you  tit bags 
  will everybody calm down  please 
    stan   all right  casey 
let s go alien for a second 
why here 
why ohio 
if you were going
to take over the world 
would you blow up the white house
lndependence day style   
or sneak in
through the backdoor 
  zeke screams  
    gasping  coughing  
    marybeth giggling  
  zeke continues gasping  
casey 
man  the only person
in this school who is an alien   
is you  man 
  fuck you  zeke 
  oh

shouldn t you people
be in class 
well  it s like this 
mr furlong 
casey here

  laughs  
  really 
  the whole faculty  actually 
is that true 
casey 
the  uh  thing i found yesterday  
where is it 
i sent it to the university 
do they know what it is 
look  sorry to impose and
disrupt  mr furlong  but  
if you d kindly take your seats 
this will be over quite quickly 
now sit down 
  put him the fuck down  furlong 
  this is for the best  zeke 
  groans

  hissing  
    groaning  
    marybeth screams  
  creatures screeching 
girls screaming  
  groaning  
  furlong screaming  
    spits out cap  
  zeke 
  bell rings  
this is usually the point where somebody
says   let s get the fuck outta here  
let s get the fuck outta here 
aliens are taking over
the fucking school 
we gotta have proof 
all right  everybody 
here s the deal 
we re heading straight
for the parking lot 
pull it together 
and try to stay calm 
  voice whispers  
stokely 
  girl laughing  
  voice whispers   what s stan
hanging out with those guys for 
  boy  
delilah 
  indistinct whispering  
  zeke

  where you going  buddy

  sure you don t want to play with us 
nah  gabe    but thanks 
  screeching  
what the fuck is going on 
let s see if anybody s talking 
  turns on radio  
  static  
  pushing radio buttons  
    police radio  lndistinct  
  who the fuck are these guys 
all right 
pull over here  fellas 
  fuck this shit    revs engine  
    officer   hey 
  car approaching quickly  
  tyres screeching  
  closing car doors  
    casey   where s your mom and dad 
    zeke   europe  i think 
oh  shit 
  oh  my god 
    stan   this is some serious shit 
  chuckles   this is your big secret 
caffeine pills 
you didn t see that 
  delilah   what are we gonna do with
the police not being an option 
  stan   i can call my dad 
he d know what to do 
if he s even
your dad anymore 
it s called a gun  man 
what is it 
we re gonna find out 
hey  come here  oscar 
come here  buddy 
jeez 
now what 
i m sorry  buddy 
  sudden crack  
  sighs  
see  it s a parasite 
it attaches itself to a host 
and then it controls it 
  it s incomplete 
  what do you mean 
it can survive on its own  but it s
really part of a greater organism 
look  it has the ability to replicate 
but it needs a host 
something moist 
see what it did to oscar s insides 
it dried them out 
  stan   hey  isn t a human body
composed mainly of water 
they re using us 
  drying us out 
  like mrs brummel  right 
  casey  
i overheard the coach 
her body was too old 
she didn t take 
see  this partially explains
what happened to furlong 
that drug s a diuretic 
dries it out  kills it 
they re using us as hosts  they re just
turning us into mindless slaves   
  they can control 
  how do you know that 
she doesn t 
she s a trekkie sci fi freak 
who s been right so far 
how do we stop it 
yeah  stokely 
this is your area 
in theory 
they re all connected 
  if we kill the master 
we get them all 
   ln theory  
what happens to everybody else 
the ones who ve been taken over 
do they just die 
no  they don t 
they would become human again 
but that is
in theory  so  
so if we found the leader
and killed it 
  we d beat it 
  what are we even talking about 
  i say we get the fuck out of town 
    casey   and go where 
don t you see  we got to stop it
or it s gonna spread 
it took the high school
in a day and a half 
give it a week 
we ll never outrun it 
  we have to fight 
    stan   fight what 
we don t even know
who s alien and who s not 
what if one of us was an alien
right now  how would we know 
he s right  how do i know
you re really casey 
how do i know
you re really you 
in body snatchers 
humans became emotionless 
  they completely lost their identities 
    stan   the coach had emotion 
i mean  he s usually a real hard ass 
but he was different somehow 
his behaviour
was slightly odd 
like a star quarterback who mysteriously
quits the football team 
  scoffs

came here and met you 
all of you 
all of you were different
from the others 
  softly  
thanks  pal 
you were lost and lonely 
just like me 
and i thought that maybe
i could give you a taste of my world 
a world without anger 
without fear  without attitude 
where the underachiever
goes home at night to parents who care 
the jock can be smart 
the ugly duckling beautiful 
and the class wuss doesn t
have to live in terror 
and the new girl   well 
she can just fit right in with
people who are just like her 
you see  casey  even marybeth s
feelings can be hurt   
by a bunch of pathetic 
lost  little outcasts   
who truly believe that their
disaffected lonely life   
is the only way
they can survive 
i can make you a part of something
so special  casey  so perfect 
so fearless 
don t you want that  casey 
  casey  
i d rather be afraid

of fiction gets it right

  female reporter   as you
can see  life has returned
to normal at herrington high   
after the mysterious disappearance of
several faculty members one month ago 
both the local authorities and
the f b i  have largely discounted   
several students  claim
that an extraterrestrial was involved 
a spokesperson for the f b i 
has indicated   
that no substantiating evidence
has been found 
that goes for you too  zeke 
just  cause you re the new guy doesn t
mean we re gonna cut you any slack

high school invasion to death

is ongoing 
no regrets

   cause they ll put words
into your mouths  
  they re making you
feel so ashamed  
  they re making you
take all the blame  
  they re making you cold
in the night  
  they re making you question

  i watch the ripples
change their size  
  but never leave the stream  
  of warm impermanence and  
  so the days
float through my eyes  
  but the days
still seem the same  
  and these children
that you spit on  
  as they try
to change their worlds  
  are immune
to your consultation  
  they re quite aware of what
they re going through  
  ch ch ch ch changes  
  turn and face
the strange  
  ch ch changes  
  don t tell them to grow up
and out of it  
  ch ch ch ch changes  
  turn and face
