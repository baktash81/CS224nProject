the art therapy instructor
door lock buzzing
arms up
i trust we wont go through
this every day
doctor anna
welcome are you ready
for your first day hmm

do you live far
uh somewhat but its worth it
always wanted to use art

are quite docile but others
attendant doctor its leena
shes not in her room
nobody can find her
speaks estonian lock it
alarm blares
attendant shouts in estonian
guard speaks estonian
suspenseful music playing
attendant speaks estonian
anna whos leena
our most dangerous patient
in fact shes the reason
for the opening youre filling
your predecessor
underestimated her
and ignored protocol
did not end well
listen to me
do not leave this room
dont worry
you will be safe here
and ill come back
after weve found her
anna please please
pencil scratching
anna hello there
anna exhales
anna does your mum
or dad work here

i is that me
chuckles
thats very good
im anna whats your name
eerie music playing
leena leena
you didnt a answer me before
do your parents work here
why would you think that
because youre im what
door buzzes opens
doctor leena
doctor speaks estonian
anna breathing shakily
put it down
anna exhales
leena put it down now
chuckles
anna you didnt tell me
she was a child
doctor thats because
shes not
leena suffers
from a gland disorder
which causes uh
proportional dwarfism
essentially halting her growth
around age ten
make no mistake
leena may look like a child
but she is a grown woman
thirty one to be exact
when leena first arrived
she struggled so hard
against her restraints
that she would bleed severely
it was a lesson for all of us
on the depths
of her will to be free
much of leenas early life
was spent doing whatever
she could to survive
but she never grew older
at least not on the outside
imagine going through
your whole life
the world seeing only a child
it is very important that you
do not see her in that way
leena uses her affliction
as much as she suffers from it
shes a exceptional con artist
two years ago
leena wormed her way
into this family by posing
as a runaway
this family took her in
they fed her they clothed her
normally leena would
simply steal whatever she could
and then disappear
but this time
she um
well let me put it this way
she lives here now

that is beyond fucked up
this is all i ever do anymore
by the way chuckles
clean up after my kids
dont worry about it
mommyll take care of it
mommy takes care of everything
when gunnar told me
donnan came to the house
i knew id find you here
you could have robbed us blind
and disappeared
the second you had a chance
but you didnt
why is that
youre thinking bigger right
play the part manipulate us
and a year from now we meet
with some tragic accident
am i getting warm
let me go
youll never see me again
tricia thats exactly
what im afraid of
we cant have esther
disappear twice now can we
she didnt disappear
tricia there was nothing
that i could do for her
it was too late
gunnar he was always
way too rough with her
that night he just went too far
what was i supposed to do
hand over the only child
i had left over some
sibling bullshit
that went too far
i loved my daughter
with all my heart
but a mother protects
her family no matter what
and if you think chuckles
that im going to let some
psycho dwarf destroy
what i have built
youre mistaken
this family came over
on the fucking mayflower
and built this country
we matter allen matters
when he got the news
esther was alive
the happiness on his face
i had to make this work
dramatic music playing
allen doesnt know
what happened to esther
and you are gonna help me
make sure that he never does
theres only one thing worse
than the death of a child
and that is a child
who is missing
esthers disappearance
changed allen
changed who he was
who he is supposed to be
but you are the answer
both grunt
tricia you and i have a chance
to turn this mess
into a mutually
beneficial arrangement
esthers down there isnt she
grunts
dont you fucking say her name
okay
tricia you conned your way
into my family
you chose this role
and now youre gonna
fucking play it
so you can be esther for now
and live a life
that anyone would kill to have
or you take the fall for this
and get shipped back
to estonia in handcuffs
what do you say
car approaching
leena im sorry i scared you
allen im sorry im sorry
we should have
never left you alone
what happened
she fell off her bike
i found her by the side
of the road
honey what are you doing
on a bike
come here lets
lets get warm
mom im so sorry
stop
what the fuck
yeah
so what does this mean
tricia well it means
shes not a kid
she is a grown woman
and we cannot underestimate her
no shes more than that
mother
shes a psychopath living
in our fucking house
shushes
so we just have to live
with this person
i didnt say that
so then can we just you know
make it look like an accident
its too soon
we need to think about this
so she just owns us now
no no she has just as much
to lose as we do
look neither of us
were expecting this
so for now we just
keep an eye on her
and when the time is right
well end it
this is insane even for us
suspenseful music playing
door opening closing

if you hadnt talked
to the parrot
sydney was a macaw
oh
all macaws are parrots
but not all fucking parrots
are macaws
what are we gonna do about that
oh we make her believe
together
dr segar one of our goals here
is helping esther acclimate
back into life
within the family unit
part of that is remembering
your shared history
moments you had the fun things
you did together before
mr al bright whats a memory
that means a lot
to you and to esther
oh god there are so many
chuckles leena chuckles
um there was christmas
in paris

sirens blaring
youve gotta give a little
take a little
and let your poor heart
break a little
thats the story of
thats the glory of love
youve gotta laugh a little
cry a little
before the clouds
roll by a little
thats the story of
thats the glory of love
as long as theres
the two of you
youve got the world
and all its charms
and when the world is
through with you
youve got each others arms
youve gotta win a little
lose a little
and always have
the blues a little
thats the story of
thats the glory of love
