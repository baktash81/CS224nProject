doctor  anna 
welcome  are you ready
for your first day  hmm 
anna  i think so 
please 
do you live far 
uh  somewhat  but it s worth it 
always wanted to use art
to help people 
wonderful 
 elevator bell dings 
doctor  please 
this way 
those are
our security procedures

most of our patients
are quite docile  but others

she s not in her room 
nobody can find her

anna  who s leena 
our most dangerous patient 
in fact  she s the reason
for the opening you re filling 
your predecessor
underestimated her
and ignored protocol 
did not end well 
listen to me 
do not leave this room 
don t worry 
you will be safe here 
and i ll come back
after we ve found her 
anna  please  please   
 pencil scratching 
anna  hello  there 
 anna exhales 
anna  does your mum
or dad work here 
can i see 
i    is that me 
 chuckles 
that s very good 
i m anna  what s your name 
 eerie music playing 
leena  leena

doctor  leena 
 doctor speaks estonian 
 anna breathing shakily 
put it down 
 anna exhales 
leena  put it down  now 
 chuckles 
anna  you didn t tell me
she was a child 
doctor  that s because
she s not 
leena suffers
from a gland disorder
which causes  uh 
proportional dwarfism 
essentially halting her growth
around age ten 
make no mistake 
leena may look like a child 
but she is a grown woman 
thirty one  to be exact 
when leena first arrived 
she struggled so hard
against her restraints
that she would bleed severely 
it was a lesson for all of us
on the depths
of her will to be free 
much of leena s early life
was spent doing whatever
she could to survive 
but she never grew older 
at least not on the outside 
imagine going through
your whole life 
the world seeing only a child 
it is very important that you
do not see her in that way 
leena uses her affliction
as much as she suffers from it 
she s a exceptional con artist 
two years ago 
leena wormed her way
into this family by posing
as a runaway 
this family took her in 
they fed her  they clothed her 
normally  leena would
simply steal whatever she could
and then disappear 
but this time 
she  um   
well  let me put it this way 
she lives here now

she can shed some more light
on what she s been through 
we have a child therapist
that she ll be working with

but i will tell you 
she is in far better shape
intellectually and emotionally
than i would expect 
tricia  well  that s good 
right 
dr  segar  i did notice
some inconsistencies 
for example 
she said that was sydney 
sydney was a macaw 
bright orange
and four times the size 
yet  today  she addressed
this bird as sydney
with complete confidence 
tricia  what are you getting at 
dr  segar  to me

our child psychologist feels
esther should tell her story
within the confines of   
donnan  and not
with a cop like me 
don t worry  i get it 
but esther did vanish
from our little town 
and that remains a concern 
i need to know

mommy ll take care of it 
mommy takes care of everything

why is that 
you re thinking bigger  right 
play the part  manipulate us 
and a year from now we meet
with some tragic accident

tricia  that s exactly
what i m afraid of 
we can t have esther
disappear twice now  can we 
she didn t disappear 
tricia  there was nothing
that i could do for her 
it was too late 
gunnar  he was always
way too rough with her 
that night he just went too far 
what was i supposed to do 
hand over the only child
i had left over some
sibling bullshit
that went too far 
i loved my daughter
with all my heart 
but a mother protects
her family  no matter what 
and if you think     chuckles 
   that i m going to let some
psycho dwarf destroy
what i have built   
you re mistaken 
this family came over
on the fucking mayflower
and built this country 
we matter  allen matters 
when he got the news
esther was alive 
the happiness on his face 
i had to make this work 
 dramatic music playing 
allen doesn t know
what happened to esther 
and you are gonna help me
make sure that he never does 
there s only one thing worse
than the death of a child 
and that is a child
who is missing 
esther s disappearance
changed allen 
changed who he was 
who he is supposed to be 
but you are the answer 
 both grunt 
tricia  you and i have a chance
to turn this mess
into a mutually
beneficial arrangement 
esther s down there  isn t she 
 grunts 
don t you fucking say her name 
okay 
tricia  you conned your way
into my family 
you chose this role 
and now you re gonna
fucking play it 
so  you can be esther for now 
and live a life
that anyone would kill to have 
or you take the fall for this
and get shipped back
to estonia in handcuffs 
what do you say 
 car approaching 
leena  i m sorry i scared you 
allen  i m sorry  i m sorry 
we should have
never left you alone

mother 
she s a psychopath living
in our fucking house

so we just have to live
with this person

it s too soon 
we need to think about this 
so she just owns us now 
no  no  she has just as much
to lose as we do
