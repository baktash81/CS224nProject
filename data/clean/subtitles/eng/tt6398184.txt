morning
special one today
blimey
what have you got there
wouldnt you like to know
just arrived milord
theres one
from buckingham palace
heavens
but we really need
to cut back until the farms
repay the investment
and we must make a plan
for the roof
well this wont help us
to economize
what is it
the king and queen
are coming to stay
what
during their yorkshire tour
thats it
just for a night
theyll spend one night
at downton
and then go on to harewood
for a ball
while theyre here
theres to be a parade
of the yorkshire hussars
in the village
is there any chance
henry might be back
well i doubt it
ill send a telegram
but theres a motor show
in chicago
that i know he cannot chuck
tom youre keeping
your enthusiasm under control
is this the irish patriot
making a reappearance
i know you find my opinions
highly entertaining
i suppose theyll send people
to check that mrs patmore
isnt a russian spy
mm
will you tell them
downstairs barrow
ill see to her ladyship
yes milord
a royal luncheon
a parade and a dinner
im going to have to sit down
oh what about mr branson
what about him
well hes a republican
isnt he
should mr carson look in
no one is to say that word
in front of him
i agree with mr branson
i dont like kings either
i suppose that makes me
a republican too
are the english allowed to be
two weeks to get ready golly
its quite an honor
it is but if i know
anything about royal visits
we will never stop
changing our clothes
ive just been
on a buying spree
which is good
madame handleyseymour
is making me a ball dress
ill get her to hurry it up
have her send it here
how are things otherwise
oh you know
ive got a luncheon for 30
today in aid of the lifeboats
or is that tomorrow
anyway
its in aid of something
sounds like business as usual
ill see you soon darling
you know i can bring back
as many vegetables
as we could eat
yeah i like to keep busy
yeah
how have they taken the news
up at the house
daisys singing
the marseillaise
so no surprises there
oh whats the matter
i thought youd be pleased
i am pleased
the visit is a great honor
but members of the royal
and imperial household
are coming to downton
who will have visited
the greatest houses in the land
blenheim chatsworth arundel
does mr barrow know
what hes taking on
why should it affect you
youre not in charge anymore
now come in for your lunch
and let me get back
all right sir here we are
this will do very well
thank you
the lady bagshaw your majesty
good
well go to the 1844 room
as soon as theyre here
do sit down
ive just received the plan for
the tour of yorkshire maam
yes its just been finalized
i think well enjoy it
i didnt realize we would be
staying at downton abbey
only for a night
theres to be a parade
and a dinner
and then we go on
to princess mary at harewood
i just wondered
if i might perhaps
go straight to harewood
lord grantham is my cousin
and the two families have
fallen out
or at least we might
if i were there in person
and what would cause
this quarrel
lord granthams mother believes
her son should be my heir
old lady grantham can be
very hard to resist
as i am well aware
exactly maam
but surely they need to know
if their hopes
are to be disappointed
i wish i knew if they like
simple food or fancy
i cant think
theyll want simple food
with that sort
dont they like sauces
and everything velouté and
frappé and smothered in cream
that sort
hes the king of england
theres only one of them
in the world
that sort indeed
dont plan too much
not until we know
whats expected
well i know whats
expected of me food
you too daisy so less
philosophy more elbow grease
is the pudding ready
it is
oh daisy take the soufflés
out of the oven
while i find me specs
this country needs a shakeup
ah you should run for parliament
why not
lady astors done it
and so an undercook
from yorkshire
is bound to follow her
well youve got to have
big dreams
but do you have
big dreams andy
ive not offended you have i
why do you say that
well for a start
you never talk
about the wedding anymore
well get wed when were
good and ready and not before
but you see i am ready
take those up
before they collapse
maud bagshaw is coming
to downton
yes as the queens
ladyinwaiting
oh my goodness
why so surprised
who is she
well shes a cousin
of your fathers
wellwell discuss it later
youre not
to make things awkward
hows it all going
well marys got it
under control
hardly theres so much to do
who were those men measuring
on the green as we came past
theyre building the dais
for the queen at the parade
oh how exciting
seems rather a waste of money
oh here we go
isnt that what
the monarchys for
to brighten the lives
of the nation
with stateliness and glamour
to quote tennyson kind hearts
are more than coronets
and simple faith
than norman blood
will you have enough clichés
to get you through the visit
if not ill come to you
thank you barrow
and now you were gonna
tell us about lady bagshaw
is she a very distant cousin
no her father was
my great uncle
then why have i
never heard of her
because she chose to cut
herself off from the family
do you know the reason
maybe
see i believe she means
to cheat your father
of his rightful inheritance
she has no children
your father is
her nearest relation
i wont have her put
on the spot
youre plotting something
i see a machiavellian look
in your eye
machiavelli is
frequently underrated
he had many qualities
so did caligula
not all of them charming
what are you up to granny
well ideally i would like
maud to see your father
as the son she never had
will she be the mother
i never had
sarcasm is
the lowest form of wit
oh hello
mr molesley
its very late for you
to be out
is it true
is what true mr molesley
mr bakewell said
that youd warned him
that there was to be
a royal visit
well now i know who not
to trust with a secret
that we should deserve
such honor
not you too
i am disappointed
ignore her
i wonder do you think
i might be allowed
to slip on my livery again
would the school let you
oh theyll give me time
for this i promise
lets wait
till we know our orders
what about it mr barrow
will you let me wait upon
my king and queen
uh well
thats us
good night mr molesley
when were done
shall i fetch johnny
or will you
i can fetch him
how exciting
thank you
theyre all mental
all this fuss for a man
and woman we dont even know
no never mind that
i wanted to tell you
ive had some ideas about what
to serve at your wedding
stop going on about my wedding
weve only a few days left
so i spoke to her ladyship
and shes agreed
our normal rules
should be suspended
we wont clean a room
if a family member is using it
but otherwise
all restrictions are lifted
no detail should be left
undone however small
i want every surface
in this house
to gleam and sparkle
by thursday
blimey
can i have your attention
please
uh for this afternoon
their majesties butler
mr wilson
will be coming over
from raby castle
with a ladys maid and a valet
to give us our instructions
with the royal servants
are we to wait on them
that is what
will be made clear
i wont be waiting
on any valets and ladys maids
thank you very much
before we get hot under the
collar lets just wait and see
what they have to say
amen
mr branson
can i help you sir
its really you i came to see
oh well how can i help you mister
chetwode
major chetwode
am i right youre mr branson
lord granthams soninlaw
i am
oh
the uh the papers tell me
the king and queen
will be staying at downton abbey
during their tour of yorkshire
well if its in the papers
it must be true
yes great honor
although as an irishman
you may feel differently
i know when my parentsinlaw
have been paid a compliment
well theres to be
a military parade i gather
how do you
how do you feel about that
what do you mean how do i feel
only you didnt say
whether you support them
the king and queen
i support lord grantham
very neat
until we meet again
mr branson
ah barrow
they said youd be in here
heavens we can still
put on quite a show
when we need to
im glad to see
has it all been cleaned
more or less everythings been
done to a basic level milady
but we havent done
the final buffingup
why not
i was waiting
for their majesties butler
i thought id ask his advice
on what to use on the table
really
cant we decide what we lay
on our own dining table
front doorbell mr barrow
please go
milady
greetings mr wilson
welcome to downton abbey
uh this way mr wilson
the royal butlers
terribly scary
barrow looked like a rabbit
in front of a cobra
oh dear
should i go down
they know what theyre doing
do they
theyre hideously behind
theres a mark on the blue room
carpet we cant shift
i have no chairs for the parade
and we havent even decided
on the footmen
im going to have another cup
if no ones coming up to serve
this is nice
princess mary wants us
for tea tomorrow at harewood
ugh ive got so much to do
i wonder if that means
the young couple
have taken over the big house
theyre hardly
the young couple
well he isnt anyway
she always seems
quite shy to me
a shy royal
is that an oxymoron
anyway were going
right
i will return to raby castle
and come back to downton
in advance of their majesties
on thursday
but his majestys valet
mr ellis
and her majestys dresser
miss lawton
will stay on
if that is convenient
or they can put up
in the village
no well find them rooms
then monsieur courbet
the chef
eexcuse me
mr courbet the chef
thats right
wed be very grateful if you
could make the kitchens ready
so what should i order
nothing
he will bring it all
and we dont cook any
of the food
um cook for the servants
monsieur courbet
wont have time for that
oh i see
that is something
to look forward to
calm yourself mrs patmore
if its the way
these things are done
mrs webb
and four footmen will arrive
with monsieur courbet
the day before
who is this
mrs webb is it
she is the housekeeper
she will also bring two maids
with her
the housekeeper
while their majesties are here
and the maids
they will make the beds
clean the bathrooms
that sort of thing
i see
so my maids and i will not be
involved in the preparations
you mean during the stay
youll be the butler and
excuse me
i am not a butler
i am the kings
page of the backstairs
so our staff has nothing to do
im sure they can be useful
but how can they eat
and get dressed at raby castle
if the chef and the valet
and the maid are all here
we have two of each
the principal valet
and the principal dresser
will arrive in advance
of their majesties
who bring an equerry
a ladyinwaiting
two detectives
and two chauffeurs
the other chef goes from raby
to harewood
four footmen go with him
and the other four come here
do you all understand me
you can hardly heckle
lady bagshaw
in front of the queen
well im just trying
to prevent a crime
who says its a crime
i do
oh and youre an expert
in the matter
i am an expert in every matter
you must have some idea
why she doesnt want robert
as her heir
i have none
he is her closest relative
the family have held brompton
for three centuries
but she wants to give it to who
charity
the dogs home
well i would have thought
the family had enough
to worry about
thats not the point
well very well
we must try
and discover her reasons
well what possible reasons
can there be
well thats what i intend
to find out
carson
oh milady
please come in
this is an honor
i dont want to be a nuisance
but i need your help carson
barrow just isnt up
to the task
milady
he wont clean the silver
or he wont let andrew clean it
what
he says the page of the
thingummy
will choose which pieces to use
i see
the truth is
hes in a sort of trance
wont you help me
i feel im pushing
a rock uphill
ill be there in the morning
milady dont you worry
youre a treasure carson
thats all there is to say
ill see myself out
you could never refuse her anything
mm
and what about mr barrow
mr barrow can like it
or lump it
then im afraid hell lump it
we have supper
after the upstairs dinner
so youve plenty of time
thanks
how does it work
with two valets
well i prepare
his majestys clothes
and uniforms for downton
then when mr miller arrives
i get the stuff
for harewood ready
then i head back to london
and prepare for their return
it all overlaps
so mr millers the one
who actually dresses the king
unless hes ill then its me
is he often ill
no
i think its rubbish
they impose they demand
and now were to be made
nothing in our own house
its very disappointing
i wont deny it
this waters not too hot
have they all been having baths
how should i know
mr barrow dont you think you
should speak to his lordship
about what
well its not right surely
for us to be humiliated
in this way
well what could he do about it
is the staff
always ridden over roughshod
whenever royalty come to stay
why do they bring
so many servants with them
maybe its because they go
from house to house
around the county
and they need to know
things are done
the way they like
as if we couldnt manage that
were not footballs
mr bates
and we dont deserve a kicking
but what are we
to say to barrow after all
hes done nothing wrong
hes done nothing at all
thats the problem
but it feels very unfair
oh i see
so its now
ive sent down
for mr barrow to join us
milord
you wanted to see me milord
mr carson
what brings you here
well this is the thing
carson is going to move
back into the house
for the royal visit
what
you are coming back here
as butler
when i am the butler here
yes uh that is
can i ask how long
this has been planned milord
well i wouldnt say
its been exactly planned
because i dont quite understand
where it leaves me
well you can be a sort of
with your permission
id prefer not to be
a sort of anything milord
i will surrender my position
for the duration of the visit
if i must
and serve you again
when their majesties
have gone if you so wish
please dont think that
by the way
the boilers playing up
and theres no hot water
god thats all we need
now barrow
not to worry the plumber
will soon have it mended
milady
and well bring water jugs
up to the bedrooms tonight
and in the morning
it cant be that hard
we did it for 300 years
thank you carson
well that went well
will you sack him
no as a matter of fact
i was quite interested
i never thought of him
as a man of principle before
ill have to tell him
im only ordering
for the servants hall
im afraid
ive got his hopes up
aha
oh speak of the devil
come in come in i was
just saying youll be wanting
to finalize the order
were you indeed
honestly no one in the village
can talk about anything else
of course
oh now i know its
a bit of a liberty
but ive made a list
of all the ingredients
of your favorite dishes
i know them well enough
after all these years
but some things
will have to be brought in
so we should really
get on with it
oh well i appreciate
everything youve done
mr bakewell
my heart is fit to burst
i dont mind telling you
i shall have fed
the kingemperor
from my own shop
if only my father were alive
hed be so proud of me
he would
well iim sure hed be proud
of you anyway mr bakewell
oh no no not like this no
this is the peak of my career
well the peak
of my life really
everyones so jealous
oh now ive put ticks
next to the ones
i think youll go for
now the thing is
im guessing the luncheon
will be for around a dozen
of course
the dinner will be larger
lets say 30 or thereabouts
youll correct me if im wrong
well you see
youre not wrong mr bakewell
but well say
if the numbers change
the pavlovas not realistic
wed be safer
with a charlotte russe
we can do most
of the work before
and i shall be serving
think of that
ive danced with a man
whos danced with a girl
whos danced
with the prince of wales
im crazy with excitement
no stop it mr molesley
completely off the rails
all of my suppliers
are so excited
oh mrs patmore
i shall never be able
to thank you enough
not if i live to be 100
i feel like a liar
i should go back
and lower yourself
to a kitchen skivvy
in the eyes of the village
never mind ruining
mr bakewells year
youll do no such thing
no maid no valet
no nanny even
its 1927
were modern folk
nanny will take care
of marigold
and anna can look after you
really can she
of course
just like the old days
grannys here and isobel
and were paying a call this
afternoon on princess mary
oh has my new ball dress
arrived
not yet but it will
hello mary
how are you
how long have you worked
for her majesty miss lawton
six years
how interesting
i expect youre a skilled
needlewoman for that job
well ive had no complaints
i trained under madame lucile
her majesty wanted
a professional dressmaker
and they found you
my reputation found me
oh
come on you two
its nearly 300
we ought to get ready
will the princess be at the parade
thank you
they both will
what time are they expecting us
i always find her rather sad
princess mary
well she is royal
royal women are not meant
to grin like cheshire cats
well they dont have
to look miserable
well to you
she looks miserable
to me she looks dignified
doesnt that say it all
how comforting
to see you here carson
what prompted you to take up
the flaming sword again
i felt i should go where i
could do the most good milady
wise words for all of us
her royal highness is here
the marchioness of hexham
the countess of grantham
the lady mary talbot
your royal highness
please sit down lady grantham

i better let you get started
so ill be on me way
arent you gonna wish me luck
you dont look as if you need me

ah
may i present major chetwode

to keep an eye on me
i was rather hoping youd be
my guide for the ceremony
would you like a drink
ill join you in a minute
well well done
whos he
i dont really know
army perhaps
or maybe a civil servant
but ill drink with him
and try and put his mind
at rest
what does he want
maybe to make sure im a leopard
who has changed his spots
what about you milady
is everything ready
no
and my heart is pounding
by the way
have you seen the silver box
from the table by the fire
in the drawing room
my grandmother used to keep
playing cards in it
i know the one
is it missing
yes
and so is the little cupid
from the mantelshelf
oh they must have been taken
downstairs for cleaning
i was just coming to you
milady
oh dont worry im fine
if thats all milady
i suppose
can you manage the jug
and basin
or are they too heavy
no no i can do it
oh hows the boiler
im sure theyll fix it soon
bertie was with tom earlier
you dont think tom
would ever try to make trouble
why do you say that
well bertie says
theres some army type
who has him under surveillance
tom likes to shock thats all
hed never be disloyal
to this family never
shall we go down
yes lets
so i said to her
listen lady
theres a little one here
who still needs turning
oh
careful mr sellick
youll make daisy blush
takes more than that
to make me blush
now get that down you
you deserve that
its very late
well ive got to get it done
and i dont mind long hours
i uh mean to build
me own business
and you cant do that
working 900 to 500
these water jugs
nearly killed me
how did we manage
in the old days
well maybe people
were tougher then
maybe they expected less
from life
well i expect a lot from life
so do i
and i mean to have it too
are you still here
mr sellicks been working hard
for hours
for our benefit andy
then its time he went home
is the savory ready
take this
mmm
hes right the new pump
should arrive around 900
ill be here
so will we
tara
that was mama shes in london
shes staying with rosamund
she cant be
she was here for lunch
she didnt say anything
she went up this afternoon
shell be back tomorrow
so ive asked her
to come for tea
you must persuade her
to leave maud bagshaw alone
i dont believe even mama
will pick a quarrel
in front of the king
i wonder if he can come early
are you excited
i am a bit are you
would it be common to admit it
not to an american
here we go mr carson
leave this to me
i am monsieur courbet
and this is mrs webb
the housekeeper
ah follow that path
and itll take you
into the kitchen courtyard
i said i am monsieur courbet
chef to their majesties
well done charlie
always start
as you mean to go on
this way gentlemen
miss lawton
i was just looking round
its a beautiful house
youve seen many that are finer
thats what i came for
but we shouldnt be in here
really
prepare for your
battle with the barbarians
oh
you uh where can i put this
dont tempt me
weve cleared some space
in the scullery
and that cupboard
what a lot of fuss over nothing
well wheres our order
from mr bakewell
follow me
well how did you manage it
a gardener helped me carry
everything in so no one saw
i suppose you could sell the lot
and use the money
to pay mr bakewell
dont worry
they can eat it gradual
when the visits over
ah its done mrs patmore
the new pumps installed
hail the conquering hero
its mrs hughes
you should be telling
or mr carson not them
its all right mr sellick
well see the news
gets through thanks
i would not feed it to my dog
but i dont need
your help mrs hughes
i just want to know where
their majesties are sleeping
so miss stinson
can prepare the rooms
then i will show you mrs webb
because without my help
you will not find them
is it always like this
a royal visit is like a swan
on a lake
grace and serenity above
demented kicking down below
i wish i could get away
ive got tomorrow night off
when mr miller arrives
told my mum id look in
why dont you come to york
with me
we could have a drink
you should go
youre not on duty
that settles it then
ill come find you
when im released
we can borrow a car
mrs webb
i am the housekeeper here
you are not housekeeper
so long as
his majesty is under this roof
yes but hes not here yet
is he
its like living in a factory
it reminds me of our days
as a convalescent home
during the war
i enjoyed that although
i always feel guilty saying so
wheres tom
daddys in the village
again
whats he playing at
oh i saw tom
looking very stern
as i came up the drive
i hope hes not building a bomb
many a true word
is spoken in jest
we think hes being tailed
by special branch
nonsense
mama how was london
oh fine fine
what were you there for
oh various things
but you hate london
whoever told you that
now when do you want me
tomorrow
1200 at the latest
they arrive at half past
but mama you must promise
not to attack maud bagshaw
well i cant ignore her
she is my cousin
exactly
greet her as a cousin
and leave it at that
ill think about it
but even if she has
left everything to an outsider
what could we do
challenge the will
on what basis
undue influence
but how could you know that
and how would you prove it
wed find a friendly judge
friendly or corrupt
whichever does the trick
are you here
for dinner mama
its a buffet
well im not changed
we wont change
either so you just need
to take off your hat
you talk as if that were easy
wheres the paper knife
the silver one
with my regimental crest
they wont help tonight
apparently
they wont lift a finger
but then my food
is only fit for servants
well at least your young hero
seems to have sorted out
the water
hes not my hero
yes
why did you call him that
oh it was just a joke
but whys it funny
oh andy leave it
but this is a rabbit hutch
dont look at me
mr courbet you couldnt
swing a cat in my room
gentlemen please
im sure youll find
out of my way
i will have a bath
and then i will decide
perhaps i will find a hotel
where can we eat
somewhere apart
uh why not
in the servants hall
we never eat
with the resident staff
excuse me
the waters cold
whats happening
ththis is impossible
we cant stay here
with no hot water
are you crazy
but the boiler was fixed today
it was hot an hour ago
well its cold now
why are you
here again mr carson
so you could keep control
when i would fail
was that it ii forget
you mr barrow
would you mind
im not on duty mr carson
you are
sorry sir
what do you want
since you are in my room
sitting at my desk
it is for me to ask
what you want
nothing from you
i would remind you that i have
been in charge of downton
for many years
mr carson
you are a retired servant
in a minor provincial house
serving an
undistinguished family
your history
is of no interest to me
now if you will excuse me
so what would you
like me to do
i would like you to find
a good book
and read it until we leave
mr carson youd better come
and see this
its well and truly damaged
can you mend it in time
oh yeah
but somebody should tell them
someone wanted to wreck
the royal visit
they ought to know
has the dress arrived
not yet
what am i going to wear
carson what is it
uh some folding chairs
well a great many chairs
have been delivered milady
theyre at the back door
anna thought
you should be told at once
shes right

youve seen their majesties
let it be enough
excuse me
wait a minute
whatwhat are you playing at
hang on
what
things seem calmer in the north
you mean after the strike sir
yes if calmer means
more resigned
im not sure
what the future holds
hmm
and you lady grantham
were you affected
by the general strike
well my maid was rather curt
with me while it was on sir
but you know
she is a communist at heart
so i suppose
it was only to be expected
wasnt the princess joining us
uh they telephoned
lord lacelles has been
held up by something
uh but they are planning
to come for the parade
i imagine the servants bedrooms
are quite pleasant here
why are you worried
for your maid
how clever of you
lucy is more of a companion
than a maid
id hate for her
to be uncomfortable
of course
i really have to go
you cant embarrass mama
im sorry but you must wait
until we stand
lord hexham
how is northumberland
as beautiful as ever sir
can it spare you do you think
well that was humiliating
go on
oh well we might as well
all go for a walk
we cannot challenge the way
a royal visit is conducted
mrs patmore
im not so sure
why dont we all meet
back here after the parade
anna mr bates
there must be no trouble or
disloyal tomfoolery of any kind
do you hear me
well meet in the wine cellar

now im walking
to mr bakewells
if youve any errands
no
well then
we should get moving
ah  of course sir
yes
here we go
maam
im so looking forward to this
okay
good lunch i thought
what was the king saying
earlier i couldnt hear
hes planning a tour for the
prince of wales next march
itll take in most
of the african colonies
and finish in cape town
and he wants you to go
he thinks
im a steadying influence
how long would you be away
about three months
i cant believe my luck
can you
i think were parked
around the back
tom
what on earth
are you doing here
i might ask you
the same question
go back or youll ruin things
isnt that what youre doing
you dont know what im doing
whos this
this is my sisterinlaw
lady mary talbot
i told you to come alone
leave this to me
tom
get the gun
there he is
hold still
got him
calm down
youre not going anywhere
hold still
are you all right sir
high treason that is
your ladyship
why are you even here
i didnt suspect him myself
until last night
how was i to know youd
given up on a free ireland
isnt it free now
not with the bloody crown
around its neck
get in
take him away
all right sir
im not impressed
you all decided
i was a royal assassin
i didnt
it was really the others
if youll follow us
to the station
why didnt you tell us
i thought hed come
to check up on me
and didnt want
to drag you into it
i assumed hed back off
if i answered his questions
and met him for a drink
but last night at the pub
i realized he wanted to use me
to get close to the king
royal salute
carry swords
sorry
excuse me
we thought youd miss it
i was just in time
i dont know why i bothered
shh
oh quiet
your majesty
the yorkshire hussars
are formed up
ready and awaiting
your inspection
where is he
hes not feeling well
wasnt he out shooting
yesterday
what do you want me to say
nothing
you have to let me leave him
we will not talk about it now
is that your maid
thats right lucy
dont you call her
by her surname
shes been with me so long
its so strange
he seemed so english
and so he was
a pillar of the establishment
until the notion
of irish independence
took him over to the other side
thats where i came in
hed heard my sympathies lay
with ireland and the republic
dont they
not at any cost
im a lawandorder man
these days
thats what you lot
have done to me
so will there be a great splash
all over the newspapers
poor papa
oh no youll find
there isnt a whisper
about this anywhere
an establishment coverup
i dont believe
in conspiracy theories
yes
do you do you write
i try
ah miss smith
did mrs hughes sort you out
she did
and have you enjoyed the parade
do you work at the house
not exactly
i sell cars
and i help with the estate
lord grantham
is my fatherinlaw
oh i do beg your pardon sir
oh no please let me explain
i started here as a chauffeur
you must be
lady sybils husband
i am
lady bagshaw and i
followed the story
we were so sad when she died
how long ago was it
seven years or nearly
my god
im sorry
its still painful
not in that way
it doesnt hurt anymore
but its still there
can i ask you something
of course
was it hard
coming up like that
joining the family
very hard
between my old world
and the new one
sometimes i didnt know
who i was
but you do now
i think so yes
i came to terms with it
why
im just curious
quickly everyone quick
come on quickly mr barrow
can somebody tell me
whats going on anna
shh
whats going on
what are we all
doing down here
shh go inside
they cant hear us in there
this is most improper
yes whywhy have you
got us all here
yeah
i will tell you
mr bates and i
we want to defend
downtons honor
in what way
would you like a repeat
of how you were all
treated at luncheon
no i bloody well would not
andrew
there are ladies present
we think we should fight back
i dont like the sound of this
i do not like this at all
anna tell them
we are going to clear the way
so you cook and serve dinner
for the king and queen
at downton abbey
as you should
well oh my god
is this a revolution
shall i fetch the pitchforks
no were serious mr moseley
but do you know
what mr courbets
brought in for tonight
mm never mind that
weve got our own supplies
and you can leave
mr courbet to me
what do you want us to do
dont bother with the maids
and valets
weve no quarrel with them
but we need to get rid
of the royal butler
for the night
the page of the backstairs
if you dont mind mr bates
and the footmen need to be
out of commission
from 700 until you finish
serving them
this is treason
well what can we do about em
well we could lock them
in the attic
any more talk like that
and well all end up
in botany bay
and did you enjoy
being pushed around
and passed over
and told to stay down here
by mr wilson
i will play
no active part in this
well suppose his majesty sees
whats going on
and is displeased
why do you think
im not capable of cooking
a decent dinner
oh no of course not
butbut i
ill see to the footmen
what are you going to do
youll find out
so does this mean
were back on duty after all
me and mr moseley
and albert as well
you know where to find
the state liveries
right
well come on daisy
will i pour wine
for the queens sweet lips
any more of that
and well lock you in the attic
i dont know why
youre bothering
what about that mrs webb
who keeps telling us
shes the housekeeper
dont you worry about mrs webb
i am more than a match
for mrs webb
i still dont know
how youre going to manage
mr courbet
well theres um
im just going upstairs
to lie down
can you get things ready
for when i come back
when will that be o mighty one
wake me in half an hour
if im not already
in the kitchen
trust us
tell us about your maid
lucy is the daughter of
davids army servant
jack smith
and like my husband
he died in the boer wars
so you looked after his child
lucy had no mother you see
so i gave her a home
thats very generous
generosity that has been amply
returned i can assure you
im glad
you dont sound very glad
oh goodness
i thought everyone
was in the drawing room
ive been dodging it
im afraid
i suppose i ought to get back
can i get someone for you
no thank you
youre the widower of the
youngest daughter arent you
ive heard of you mister
branson
tom branson
and who are you
ah i should know
but im no good
at that sort of thing
well i suppose you cant
be expected to know everyone
mm
did you enjoy the parade
im afraid
i missed it completely
i got distracted
what a shame
well to be honest
im not much of a royalist
although i probably
shouldnt say that out loud
certainly not to a stranger
that seems odd as the crawleys
would die for the crown
if they had to
you can love people
you disagree with
and you love them
theyre decent at the core
people can be decent at the core
but very difficult to live with
true enough
and theyre silly too
and snobbish at times
and i wouldnt give tuppence
for their politics
but ive learned to be happy
with all of that
and besides
theyre my daughters family
and she lives here
i nearly took her away once
but she belongs here now
i spent so much of my life
not belonging anywhere
thats important to me
i suppose in the end
its deciding
whats important isnt it
youve given me a great deal
to think about mr branson
good things i hope
that may be so but
now we must go in
we must change
and you leave in the morning
i wonder if we might have
a talk later
well find a cozy spot
and robert can join us
i wont be interrogated violet
please dont miss the chance
to settle things between you
very well
but now i must go
that was helpful
thank you
well i told you
i wanted to help
well thanks to you
we have her cornered
mr wilson
theres a telephone call
for you
for me
but sir harry they wouldnt
get to london until 900
it doesnt matter
the ball at clarence house
wont start till 1000
what ball at clarence house
the duke of connaughts
what are you playing at wilson
im not questioning you sir
not if its what
the duke of connaught wishes
but how do i manage here
dont they have footmen
at downton
yes there are footmen
but wont his majesty
his majesty wont give
a tinkers cuss
now do as i say
of course sir harry at once
everything all right
mr wilson
i need to see my footmen
and the house footmen
and the hall boy
uh when is the next train
to london
i hope its not bad news
not bad exactly
but irregular
very irregular indeed
ill get drummed out of the
regiment if they ever find out
well you sounded
convincing to me
oh im very good
at doing sir harry barnston
i can assure you
what if mr wilson rings back
no one queries
sir harrys orders
but if he did
well then theyd
uncover the trick
but they couldnt
trace it back to me
right shall we go into york
sorry to miss out
on the fun in a way
where shall i wait for you
when youre with your parents
well find a pub
did you manage
to speak to someone
i got hold
of madame seymours assistant
theyve sent you the wrong one
its similar in style
but not as you can see
in size
well wheres my dress now
on its way to new york
well thats that then
wonderful
everythings going wrong
for me today
milady
oh never mind

and the dress

and to confirm
our little chat for later
i live my own life now violet
im not what i was
my father is gone
my husband is gone
i see no reason
not to do what i want
well that doesnt mean
there is no reason
merely that you cannot see it
i think lady merton is right
well have it out
once and for all
but now i must go
to her majesty
hmm
youre not to speak
youre not to think
just follow my lead
their majesties must not know
theyre being served
by anyone different

i dont want them
to even notice
we will do our best mr wilson
i dont want your best
i want far better

what were left with

i dont know hhow
that happened
well i shall
have to go and change
well sort this out
when i return
andy
if you dont
want me to i wont
but youve already said
that you will
because its a fantastic chance
it didnt occur to me
youd mind

then in what way
i wasnt going to tell you
i wasnt going
to tell anyone but
i might be pregnant
oh darling
how marvelous
how fabulous
my heart is bursting
oh well thats
exactly what i dont want
it could easily go wrong
oh butbut if it doesnt
then ill give birth
just as you set off on
your threemonth colonial tour
why didnt you say this
when i first mentioned it
youd agreed
before i had the chance
secrets always muddle things
oh yes thats right
lets make it my fault

has something happened
old lady grantham came in
while we were dressing
i think the stage is set
for a fight later about me
she thinks lady bagshaw
means to favor me
and she doesnt approve
what business is it of hers
lady bagshaw
must have her reasons
and thats good enough for me
going down tom
good night
ah there you are miss lawton
i hope youre having
a wellearned rest
well theres
always less for me to do
when miss aplin arrives
but we must be ready

thats what i want
to talk about
later this evening when i
go up to help lady hexham
i want you to come with me
fit a new ball dress
and sew it overnight
so its done before you leave
in the morning
why on earth would i do that
the box and cupid
from the drawing room
the library paper knife
lady hexhams painted glass
never took the glass
then it must have been broken
like she said
but you took something
from that room
what was it
a patch box
from the dressing table
id like them all back please
i cant sew a dress in a night
when would i sleep
when you get to harewood
tomorrow

thatll make headlines
from here to peru
the marquess
and marchioness of granby
sir william and lady ingleby
where are the royal footmen
theyve had to go back
to london

unlucky for some milady
the earl and countess
of scarborough
ah

help me
will someone help me
im going on to turtons
in a minute
do you know it
uh
im chris webster by the way

to leave his majesty unattended
but is it for me to attend him
well youve got
your breeches on

now accept it proudly

mr courbet is missing
ditto mr wilson
and your footmen are
on their way up to london
i am still in charge here

grateful they should be to you
you were every bit as brave
as i was
mary
youre talking
in the wrong direction
dont worry about granny
shes getting ready
to give cousin maud a grilling
mainly i suspect
about her maid
i think lady bagshaw sees her
as more than just her maid
oh im sure she does
and thats what
grannys afraid of
i might as well admit
i like her
good
dont let them put you off
tom youre looking
pleased with yourself
he was just praising
lady bagshaws maid
well uh how did she contrive
to make your acquaintance
she didnt contrive anything
we met by chance
what simpletons men are
this is good
and i thought
something else was planned
but it is excellent
so a welldone to old courbet
oh yes
yes very delicious
this wasnt monsieur courbet
your majesty
mrs patmore cooked it
in fact it is
the downton abbey staff
who are serving you
this evening
oh
oh
i do beg your pardon
your majesty
thats quite enough molesley
you must give our compliments
to mrs patmore
and all the staff
molesley
huh
her majesty is speaking to you
with pleasure your majesty
that was kind of you maam
i suppose hes excited
that theyve had to take over
from our people
i wonder whats happened
whatever may have happened
does not excuse his behavior
i can assure you
lady grantham
we are quite used
to people behaving strangely
when we are near
whoa
thats it ive got you
the peelers are here
its the police
make sure no one
scarpers block all the exits
whats going on
all right gentlemen
thats the end of your evening
shut that music up now
right
you are all coming
to the station with us
were just having a bit of fun
officer
no ones making any trouble
thats for the judge to decide
judge
what did you think
were gonna slap your wrists
and send you home
ive never been here before
youre here now right
gather your things
youre coming with us
you dirty perverts out
get out move it
come on you filthy sods
come on you lot
pack it in get in the van

thank you
there might be a moment
i met the maid
she has maud wound
around her little finger
then we need to know why
mm
well ill
look forward to it gentlemen
thank you your majesty
milord
what is it hexham
well your majesty its this
ive just learned
that lady hexham
is expecting our first child
but thats wonderful news
were not telling anyone
quite yet
but i thought
youd be interested
and so i am congratulations
thethe thing is sir
its due to be born
around the time
the prince and i
will be setting off on tour
excellent
please make it register
with him
help the prince
to understand what it means
to have a real family life
you can be such an example
to him
i know it
very well
lets get to the point
robert is my nearest relation
on my fathers side
he is
but he will not be my heir
and there we have it
who will be can you tell us
lucy smith my maid
what are you out of your mind
no and i know what im doing
on the contrary
youreyoure clearly insane
you should be in an asylum
how like you
a word of resistance
and you slash with your saber
it is lucky for miss smith
that i do not own a saber
so this is truly your choice
lucy has taken care of me
for many years
i wish to show my gratitude
with the family house
with the family estate
you belong in a straitjacket
to treat your maid
as a blood relation
is to unpick every fiber
of the english way of life
what piffle you talk
oh
please there is no need to argue
i never argue
i explain
face it violet
ill outlive you anyway
so it need trouble you
no further
and now
i must attend her majesty
game set and match
to lady bagshaw
not while im the umpire
we had a few drinks
and mr barrow thought
itd be fun to play a trick
on the queers thats all
he was only in there
for five minutes
dancing the tango
with another man
come on sergeant
it was a joke
turns your stomach though
relieved to hear it
yeah id rather be dead
if i thought i was one of them
but what can i say to the earl
what earl
the earl of grantham
mr barrow is his butler
of course
youll want to see proof
of my identity
was it you who got me out
no
the good fairy came down
on a moonbeam
how did you know where id gone
the landlord told me
waited outside
followed you here
then i showed the sergeant
my card
and that seemed
to settle things
the royal household
he must have loved that
im a
im afraid
ive been a silly boy
you just need to be
a bit more circumspect
in future mr barrow
could you please remove it
milady
leaving the pins in place
can you really get it done
before you go
i dont see how
shell finish it
wont you
ill do my best
im sure youll manage
by the way i think i know
what happened to the cupid
from the drawing room milady
really was it missing
your dress will be ready
in the morning milady
thank you
i dont know how
you persuaded her
shes nice really
when you get to know her
is there anything else
only to say
that youre a genius
good night
good night
im afraid
i didnt get anywhere
well thats that
just because the king
doesnt see that a man
has any part to play
in childbearing
well he doesnt
but youd think hed know
that one likes to be around
you cant just tell him no
darling im one of
the senior peers in the land
what do you think that means
what do you think im sworn to
lady bagshaw
could i have a word
before you ring for your maid
does lucy know
that youre her mother
she does
for years
i said i was her godmother
but i told her the truth
on her 18th birthday
how old was she when jack died
six
shed lived with jack
and his mother until then
but i took her into the house
and she went
to the village school
until eventually
she became my maid
i suppose
if shed been your ward
people would have guessed
exactly
who takes notice of a servant
i hid her in plain sight
did you love jack smith
everyone should know
a total love at least once
jack was mine
my husband was very dull
you know
he wasnt a bad man but
but he wasnt a clever one
either
then he died
and jack came to see me
and it began from there
how daring
i know it sounds reckless
but i was 39
when i got pregnant
i thought i was barren
of course i knew i couldnt
tell my father so
i went to america
they must have
thought that wild
well little did they know
how wild it really was
but you were happy with jack
oh very
we had ten years together
before he died
id have married him
if id had the courage
i was weak
but you never knew my father
i suppose royal service
kept you silent on the subject
yes
in a way
but it was cowardice really
now by making lucy my heir
i will have taken
the first step
you must tell violet at once
i couldnt
youre wrong
as soon as she knows the truth
shell fathom your plans
and cease to fight you
the servants seem to be
enjoying themselves tonight
especially molesley
what happened to the royal team
its a long story milady
but youre right
we did have fun
well im glad its gone well
for everyone
but i dont think
i could face doing it again
youre not finished yet
youve still got the ball
at harewood
yes but it wont be our fault
if anything goes wrong
thats not very cheerful
the last few days
have made me think
should we really go on with it
were running the house
with too few people as it is
and half of those here now
will leave soon
what are you saying milady
isnt it time
to chuck in the towel
lots of people have
you mean leave downton
we could sell it for a school
or an old peoples home
or something
and buy a manor house
with a modest estate
and live a normal life
is that what you want
i want everything
to stop being such a struggle
will the staff stay
will the farms pay
what are we going to do
about the roof
when i was putting up
the chairs in the rain
i kept thinking
what am i doing
ill tell you
what youre doing milady
youre making a center
for the people who work here
for this village
for the county
downton abbey is the heart
of this community
and youre keeping it beating
so you think
we should battle on
while theres blood in your veins
hmm
ah miss smith
is she settled for the night
shes more rattled than settled
and i was right
there was an argument
it was about me
i hear from lord grantham
shes planning
to alter your life
for the better
he says old lady grantham
was up in arms
i can imagine
are you entitled
to your good luck
do you know why shes doing it
i do
and i think its fair
go forward in health
and use your luck wisely
i have such a feeling
that you can understand
whats going on inside my head
when no one else does
or ever could
ill miss our talks
would you like to write to me
i could always provide
a shoulder
may i
really
i should be pleased
and flattered if you would
and now i think its time
to say good night mr branson
good night miss smith
heres to the triumph of downton
and my beautiful wife
oh heres to all of you
who brought it off
heres to mr carson
for swallowing his principles
well i shant
sleep a wink tonight
and heres to her majesty
for taking pity on mr molesley
for a moment there i thought
i was headed for the tower
youre not coming round to em
are you
uh it was decent of her daisy
when she could have let it
spoil things
not everyones like robespierre
lets hear it
for the king and queen
the king and queen
ive got to tell you
something daisy
it was me that broke the pump
i dont know what i was doing
i was just in a jealous rage
why
it was that plumber you made eyes at
i just saw red
and then when i realized
id brought him
back to the house
i went nearly mad
i did not make eyes
i liked him but there was
nothing more to it
well i feel a fool now
you tried to wreck the visit
of the king of england
you risked being sacked
you risked ruin
just for the love of me
i just
my feelings took over
thats all i can say
can you forgive me
forgive you
oh andy id have done it
myself if id had the nerve
dont you see what it means
were alike you and i
full of passion
for what matters
i thought
you were easily satisfied
but i see now youre not
so we can fight our way
to a better world together
im not sure ive shown
enough gratitude
for what you did
we have to stick
together men like us
thats the point
i dont know any men like i am
ive never just talked
to someone like me
well were talking now
and it feels good
just to be two blokes
having a chat
not trying to fit in for once
well we all have to do
what we must to get by
but yeah feels good
to be two ordinary blokes
will they ever see it our way
i dont know
50 years ago whod have
thought man could fly
mrs bates
well heres the dress
we can try it before you leave
no need itll fit
those are the things you wanted
why do you do it miss lawton
doesnt it ever worry you
that on each table
in this house
theres an ornament
that you couldnt buy
with a years wages
and whats your answer
because everyone
cant have them
no one should have them
no
my answer is
why cant i have them
or some of them
dont worry
they wont miss what i take
i doubt theres more
than one in 100
would even notice theyre gone
but theyre not yours
miss lawton
and they never will be
id give it up if i were you
what if people were to think
her majesty was lightfingered
if things go missing
from every house she stays in
keep your advice for someone
whos interested mrs bates
those doors play up
something dreadful
they jam and stick
for no reason
its happened to everyone
why didnt any of you look
for me
i thought id seen you go out
mr wilson
im afraid i was mistaken
just as you were mistaken
in not waking monsieur courbet
we thought hed gone out and all
oh
thank you mrs hughes
uh a little more marmalade
if you please
the footmen have
telephoned this morning
it seems it was a hoax
that took them up to london
but who would do that
who indeed
we can investigate
when we get to harewood
i should be careful
monsieur courbet
unless you enjoy ridicule
what
id say the dinner was a success
they sent down
their compliments
so i think it must have been
well then
why call attention to it
would you show to advantage
in this story do you think
but what do we say
if were asked
there was a confusion in london
monsieur courbet was ill
if i were you
i wouldnt mention it
not unless they bring it up
quite right
there you are
ive been looking everywhere
whats the matter darling
is it something i can help with
judging by last night
i doubt it
i just want to own my own life
i want to say things that
i think and do what i like
dont you now
no
i spend my time entertaining
people who bore me to death
because theyre entitled
to sit at our table
i attend committees
that i havent chosen
because theyve chosen me
i used to have a job
that i loved but not anymore
and now my husband wont
be there when i have a baby
the woman in the lodge
is entitled to that
but im not
early warning
their majesties
are getting ready to leave
very good milord
darling whats the matter
nothing you can help with
cant i try
oh uh we should go up
their majesties
are on their way
oh right
come on
up we go
so youre off to london
theyll drop me at the station
well i hope
we can keep in touch
i feel ive finally
found a friend
is that what you found
mr barrow
a friend
their majesties are going
thanks
i want you to have this
its not much
but ive had it for years
itll remind you of me
thats the point isnt it
so you can think of me
till we meet again
thank you
mr ellis
you must come
i hope you enjoy your time
at harewood sir
yes i hope so too
it isnt really goodbye
when well see you all
this evening
were looking forward
to the ball
harewood
is such a wonderful house
well lets mount up shall we
well see you later grantham
your majesty
well done everyone
shall we head back in
mary what are you
wearing to the ball
oh i dont know
carson what happened to
the royal servants last night
hard to say milord
they sort of gave up the ghost
well you managed splendidly
although i could have done
without molesleys aria
but please thank the staff
for saving the day
oh uh mrs bates
excuse me
can i ask you something
what did you give
monsieur courbet
a double dose
of a sleeping draught
from mr bakewells
in his tea
im afraid i made rather a fool
of myself last night
you could never be a fool to me
do you mean that really
i do
and i think you know how much
youre right mrs patmore
its time i started
to plan my wedding
well i dont know
what took you so long
i wasnt sure before
but i am now
well thats good to hear
im happy mrs patmore
i dont often say that
but i am
are you very shocked by it all
i should be interfering
with the palace staff
on a royal visit
and me part of it to boot
i dont know what came over me
but
they had it coming to them
elsie
lets face it
they had it coming in spades
hello
whats this
welcome back mr talbot
hello carson mrs hughes
do you know where
ill find lady mary
after everything thats gone on
i should think
shell be lying down sir
they all will be
sounds ominous
thats nice that hes back
in time for the ball
and thank the lord
we dont have to organize it
oh darling you dont know
what weve lived though
im sorry i couldnt
get here sooner
it was the first ship after
the last meeting i promise
oh never mind
youre here now
and i dont have to go
to the ball alone
like a sad little wallflower
well ill only come
if you promise
to dance with me nonstop
oh its a deal
good evening
your majesty
i suppose maud has brought
that scheming little minx
with her
if you continue in this vein
you will only make yourself
look stupid
whatwhat do you mean
what i say
are you keeping something
from me
come with me
what
why arent you happy
i thought youd be delirious
well we are happy
if you mean it very
but how will you manage henry
by altering the way
we manage each other
and it may not be easy
but ive decided
that im staying with him
i just dont understand
what changed your mind
it was something
mr branson said
about deciding what matters
for me the crown matters more
than any of us
i can make it work
branson the irish republican
oh youre wellinformed
im better informed
than you know
so he persuaded you to do this
oh we were talking
after the parade
oh there he is
ah
say something nice please
i have to say its
been very quiet without you
mr branson
i wish we had spoken more
while we were at downton abbey
do you sir
certainly
i believe i have more than one
reason to be grateful to you
more than one
what was that all about
ill tell you when were alone
why more than one
who is she
thats princess mary
she was at downton
for the parade yesterday
didnt you see her
not at the parade
but i saw her afterwards
at the tea
so you see
she has brompton blood
albeit from an unusual angle
why did you not say this
long ago
it seemed too great a leap
for you
well who do you think i am
some maiden aunt
whos never left the village
obviously not
well dont think i approve
because i dont
but at least i understand
does miss smith know the truth
yes she does
when i get home
i will hire another maid
and lucy can be my companion
well thats much more suitable
and im afraid
youll dislike it
but she says
that she and tom branson
have agreed to correspond
dislike it
i will lick the stamps myself
you are amazing violet
you havent won you know
i dont believe in defeat
but we can hammer this out
when you come back to stay
you and lucy
when youve finished
your tour of duty
you mean i am once more
a member of this family
shes right you know
brompton is gone
and you must all learn
to live with it
i think we can get it back
for tom at least
thats why we need the girl
back here
oh violet
after all these years
you still astonish me
oh good
im glad im a revelation
and not a disappointment
its very important
quite right
oh there they are now do ask
ah yes
there you are hexham
im sad you cant be part
of the princes tour
but well find something else
for you to do
what
sir ii didnt um
i understood why not uh
as soon as her majesty
had explained it to me
congratulations to you both
youre looking very sunny tonight
im happy
why does it bother you
no but tell me
what are you playing at
with tom and cousin mauds famous maid
what do you mean
i heard you
at dinner last night
what are you up to
you know shell inherit
the brompton estate
well so mama told me
well then
wouldnt you like tom
to have a proper establishment
oh you devious cat
will they be happy
do you think they will
oh i just want a word
with granny
how long were you
planning to wait
before you told us why
you really went up to london
on wednesday
since you ask
i havent decided
so if i tell you now
will you promise
to keep it to yourself
i promise
very well i
i had some medical tests
a few weeks ago
and i went up to london
to hear the results
yes
and uh
i may not have long to live
it wont be too quick
but of course
you can never get
a london doctor to be precise
oh granny
no
no no
my dear save your tears
for something sad
ththeres nothing sad here
i have lived a privileged
and an interesting life
and now its
its time to go
im leaving the family
and the place that i treasure
in talented hands
well i know papa will be
oh no no
no i dont mean your father
i no ii love him dearly
no i i mean you
you are the future of downton
but i have such doubts granny
are we right
to keep it all going
when the world it was built for
is fading
with every day that passes
will george and caroline
still be living that life
are we living it now
no no
our ancestors
lived different lives from us
and our descendants
will live differently again
but downton abbey
will be part of them
wont be the same without you
of course it will
youll take over
from where i left off
youll be
the frightening old lady
keeping everyone up to the mark
thank you very much
you will my darling
and youll do it wonderfully
youre the best of me
that will live on
hurrah
oh granny i love you so much

the rest of my life
in a shower of
how are you feeling

thats all there is to it
ah there you are
the dancings starting
ah
you mustnt miss it
no thank you
thank you
you know youll always be
with us granny
staring from every picture
talking from every book
as long as the house stands
sounds very exhausting
do you know i think
i should prefer
to rest in peace
come on
darling
what is it you want
we have things in common
the boys horses racing
and there must be more
if we look for it
i want us to be friends
well well have to see
no dear
well have to change
both of us
how did that happen
was it you mama
how did you do it
simple
bertie asked the king
i asked the queen
i do love our adventures
but isnt it fun
when theyre over
what are you doing here
i wanted to see the dancing
so i thought id pretend
i was bringing lady bagshaw
a handkerchief
i can give it to her
if youd like
i wish you could dance with me
ive got a question for you
hmm
youd never want
to leave downton
and start up somewhere else
would you
and tell me truthfully
what brought this on
just tell me
leave downton
i think were stuck with it
arent we
yes
yes i believe we are
we shouldnt come out this way
oh they wont mind
not this once
well theyve gone
and downton is still standing
elsie a hundred years from now
downton will still be standing
and the crawleys
