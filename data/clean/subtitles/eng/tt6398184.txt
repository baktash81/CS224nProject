  morning 
  special one today 
blimey 
what have you got there 
wouldn t you like to know 
just arrived  milord 
there s one
from buckingham palace 
heavens 
but we really need
to cut back until the farms
repay the investment 
and we must make a plan
for the roof 
well  this won t help us
to economize 
what is it 
the king and queen
are coming to stay 
what 
during their yorkshire tour 
that s it 
just for a night 
they ll spend one night
at downton
and then go on to harewood
for a ball 
while they re here 
there s to be a parade
of the yorkshire hussars
in the village 
is there any chance
henry might be back 
well  i doubt it 
i ll send a telegram 
but there s a motor show
in chicago
that i know he cannot chuck 
tom  you re keeping
your enthusiasm under control 
is this the irish patriot
making a reappearance 
i know you find my opinions
highly entertaining 
i suppose they ll send people
to check that mrs  patmore
  isn t a russian spy 
  mm 
will you tell them
downstairs  barrow 
  i ll see to her ladyship 
  yes  milord 
a royal luncheon 
a parade and a dinner 
i m going to have to sit down 
  oh  what about mr  branson 
  what about him 
well  he s a republican 
isn t he 
should mr  carson look in 
no one is to say that word
in front of him 
i agree with mr  branson 
i don t like kings  either 
i suppose that makes me
a republican  too 
are the english allowed to be 
two weeks to get ready  golly 
it s quite an honor 
it is  but if i know
anything about royal visits 
we will never stop
changing our clothes 
i ve just been
on a buying spree 
which is good 
madame handley seymour
is making me a ball dress 
  i ll get her to hurry it up 
  have her send it here 
  how are things otherwise 
  oh  you know 
i ve got a luncheon for 30
today in aid of the lifeboats 
or is that tomorrow 
anyway 
it s in aid of something 
sounds like business as usual 
i ll see you soon  darling 
you know i can bring back
as many vegetables
as we could eat 
  yeah  i like to keep busy 
  yeah 
how have they taken the news
up at the house 
daisy s singing
 the marseillaise  
so no surprises there 
oh  what s the matter 
i thought you d be pleased 
i am pleased 
the visit is a great honor 
but members of the royal
and imperial household
are coming to downton
who will have visited
the greatest houses in the land 
blenheim  chatsworth  arundel 
does mr  barrow know
what he s taking on 
why should it affect you 
you re not in charge anymore 
now  come in for your lunch
and let me get back 
all right  sir  here we are 
this will do very well 
thank you 
the lady bagshaw  your majesty 
good 
we ll go to the 1844 room
as soon as they re here 
do sit down 
i ve just received the plan for
the tour of yorkshire  ma am 
yes  it s just been finalized 
i think we ll enjoy it 
i didn t realize we would be
staying at downton abbey 
only for a night 
there s to be a parade
and a dinner 
and then we go on
to princess mary at harewood 
i just wondered
if i might  perhaps 
go straight to harewood 
lord grantham is my cousin 
and the two families have   
fallen out 
or at least we might
if i were there in person 
and what would cause
this quarrel 
lord grantham s mother believes
her son should be my heir 
old lady grantham can be
very hard to resist 
as i am well aware 
exactly  ma am 
but  surely  they need to know
if their hopes
are to be disappointed 
i wish i knew if they like
simple food or fancy 
i can t think
they ll want simple food 
with that sort 
don t they like sauces
and everything velouté and
frappé and smothered in cream 
 that sort  
he s the king of england 
there s only one of them
in the world 
 that sort   indeed 
don t plan too much 
not until we know
what s expected 
well  i know what s
expected of me    food 
you  too  daisy  so less
philosophy  more elbow grease 
  is the pudding ready 
  it is 
oh  daisy  take the soufflés
out of the oven
while i find me specs 
this country needs a shake up 
ah  you should run for parliament 
why not 
lady astor s done it 
and so an under cook
from yorkshire
is bound to follow her 
well  you ve got to have
big dreams 
but do you have
big dreams  andy 
i ve not offended you  have i 
  why do you say that 
  well  for a start 
you never talk
about the wedding anymore 
we ll get wed when we re
good and ready and not before 
but  you see  i am ready 
take those up
before they collapse 
maud bagshaw is coming
to downton 
yes  as the queen s
lady in waiting 
oh  my goodness 
why so surprised 
who is she 
well  she s a cousin
of your father s 
we ll we ll discuss it later 
you re not
to make things awkward 
how s it all going 
well  mary s got it
under control 
hardly  there s so much to do 
who were those men measuring
on the green as we came past 
they re building the dais
for the queen at the parade 
  oh  how exciting 
  seems rather a waste of money 
oh  here we go 
isn t that what
the monarchy s for 
to brighten the lives
of the nation
with stateliness and glamour 
to quote tennyson   kind hearts
are more than coronets 
and simple faith
than norman blood  
will you have enough clichés
to get you through the visit 
if not  i ll come to you 
thank you  barrow 
and  now  you were gonna
tell us about lady bagshaw 
is she a very distant cousin 
no  her father was
my great uncle 
then why have i
never heard of her 
because she chose to cut
herself off from the family 
  do you know the reason 
  maybe 
see  i believe she means
to cheat your father
of his rightful inheritance 
she has no children 
your father is
her nearest relation 
i won t have her put
on the spot 
you re plotting something 
i see a machiavellian look
in your eye 
machiavelli is
frequently underrated 
he had many qualities 
so did caligula 
not all of them charming 
what are you up to  granny 
well  ideally  i would like
maud to see your father
as the son she never had 
will she be the mother
i never had 
sarcasm is
the lowest form of wit 
  oh  hello 
  mr  molesley 
it s very late for you
to be out 
is it true 
is what true  mr  molesley 
mr  bakewell said
that you d warned him
that there was to be
a royal visit 
well  now i know who not
to trust with a secret 
that we should deserve
such honor 
not you  too 
i am disappointed 
  ignore her 
  i wonder  do you think
i might be allowed
to slip on my livery again 
would the school let you 
oh  they ll give me time
for this  i promise 
let s wait
till we know our orders 
what about it  mr  barrow 
will you let me wait upon
my king and queen 
uh  well   
that s us 
good night  mr  molesley 
when we re done 
shall i fetch johnny
  or will you 
  i can fetch him 
how exciting 
  thank you 
  they re all mental 
all this fuss for a man
and woman we don t even know 
no  never mind that 
i wanted to tell you 
i ve had some ideas about what
to serve at your wedding 
stop going on about my wedding 
we ve only a few days left 
so i spoke to her ladyship 
and she s agreed
our normal rules
should be suspended 
we won t clean a room
if a family member is using it 
but  otherwise 
all restrictions are lifted 
no detail should be left
undone  however small 
i want every surface
in this house
to gleam and sparkle
by thursday 
blimey 
can i have your attention 
please 
uh  for this afternoon 
their majesties  butler 
mr  wilson 
will be coming over
from raby castle
with a lady s maid and a valet 
to give us our instructions 
with the royal servants 
are we to wait on them 
that is what
will be made clear 
i won t be waiting
on any valets and lady s maids 
thank you very much 
before we get hot under the
collar  let s just wait and see
  what they have to say 
  amen 
mr  branson 
can i help you  sir 
it s really you i came to see 
  oh  well  how can i help you  mister    
  chetwode 
major chetwode 
am i right you re mr  branson 
lord grantham s son in law 
  i am 
  oh 
the  uh    the papers tell me
the king and queen
will be staying at downton abbey
during their tour of yorkshire 
well  if it s in the papers 
it must be true 
yes  great honor 
although  as an irishman 
you may feel differently 
i know when my parents in law
have been paid a compliment 
well  there s to be
a military parade  i gather 
how do you   
how do you feel about that 
what do you mean  how do i feel 
only you didn t say
whether you support them 
the    king and queen 
i support lord grantham 
very neat 
until we meet again 
mr  branson 
ah  barrow 
they said you d be in here 
heavens  we can still
put on quite a show
when we need to 
i m glad to see 
has it all been cleaned 
more or less everything s been
done to a basic level  milady 
but we haven t done
the final buffing up 
why not 
i was waiting
for their majesties  butler 
i thought i d ask his advice
on what to use on the table 
really 
can t we decide what we lay
on our own dining table 
front doorbell  mr  barrow 
please  go 
milady 
greetings  mr  wilson 
welcome to downton abbey 
uh  this way  mr  wilson 
the royal butler s
terribly scary 
barrow looked like a rabbit
in front of a cobra 
oh  dear 
should i go down 
they know what they re doing 
do they 
they re hideously behind 
there s a mark on the blue room
carpet we can t shift 
i have no chairs for the parade 
and we haven t even decided
on the footmen 
i m going to have another cup 
if no one s coming up to serve 
this is nice 
princess mary wants us
for tea tomorrow at harewood 
ugh  i ve got so much to do 
i wonder if that means
the young couple
have taken over the big house 
they re hardly
 the young couple  
well  he isn t  anyway 
she always seems
quite shy to me 
a shy royal 
is that an oxymoron 
anyway  we re going 
right 
i will return to raby castle
and come back to downton
in advance of their majesties
on thursday 
but his majesty s valet 
mr  ellis 
and her majesty s dresser 
miss lawton 
will stay on 
if that is convenient 
or they can put up
in the village 
no  we ll find them rooms 
then monsieur courbet 
the chef   
e excuse me 
  mr  courbet  the chef 
  that s right 
we d be very grateful if you
could make the kitchens ready 
so  what should i order 
nothing 
he will bring it all 
and we don t cook any
of the food 
um  cook for the servants 
monsieur courbet
won t have time for that 
oh  i see 
that is something
to look forward to 
calm yourself  mrs  patmore 
if it s the way
these things are done   
mrs  webb
and four footmen will arrive
with monsieur courbet
the day before 
who is this   
mrs  webb  is it 
she is the housekeeper 
she will also bring two maids
with her 
the housekeeper 
while their majesties are here 
and the maids 
they will make the beds 
clean the bathrooms   
that sort of thing 
i see 
so  my maids and i will not be
involved in the preparations 
you mean  during the stay 
you ll be the butler  and   
excuse me 
i am not a butler 
i am the king s
page of the backstairs 
so  our staff has nothing to do 
i m sure they can be useful 
but how can they eat
and get dressed at raby castle
if the chef and the valet
and the maid are all here 
we have two of each 
the principal valet
and the principal dresser
will arrive in advance
of their majesties 
who bring an equerry 
a lady in waiting 
two detectives
and two chauffeurs 
the other chef goes from raby
to harewood 
four footmen go with him 
and the other four come here 
do you all understand me 
you can hardly heckle
lady bagshaw
in front of the queen 
well  i m just trying
to prevent a crime 
  who says it s a crime 
  i do 
oh  and you re an expert
in the matter 
i am an expert in every matter 
you must have some idea
why she doesn t want robert
as her heir 
i have none 
he is her closest relative 
the family have held brompton
for three centuries 
but she wants to give it to who 
charity 
the dogs  home 
well  i would have thought
the family had enough
to worry about 
that s not the point 
well  very well 
we must try
and discover her reasons 
well  what possible reasons
can there be 
well  that s what i intend
to find out 
  carson 
  oh  milady 
please come in 
this is an honor 
i don t want to be a nuisance 
but i need your help  carson 
barrow just isn t up
to the task 
  milady 
  he won t clean the silver 
  or he won t let andrew clean it 
  what 
he says the page of the   
thingummy
  will choose which pieces to use 
  i see 
the truth is 
he s in a sort of trance 
won t you help me 
i feel i m pushing
a rock uphill 
i ll be there in the morning 
milady  don t you worry 
you re a treasure  carson 
that s all there is to say 
i ll see myself out 
  you could never refuse her anything 
  mm 
and what about mr  barrow 
mr  barrow can like it
or lump it 
then i m afraid he ll lump it 
we have supper
after the upstairs dinner 
so you ve plenty of time 
thanks 
how does it work
with two valets 
well  i prepare
his majesty s clothes
and uniforms for downton 
then  when mr  miller arrives 
i get the stuff
for harewood ready 
then i head back to london
and prepare for their return 
  it all overlaps 
  so  mr  miller s the one
who actually dresses the king 
unless he s ill  then it s me 
is he often ill 
no 
i think it s rubbish 
they impose  they demand 
and now we re to be made
nothing in our own house 
it s very disappointing 
i won t deny it 
this water s not too hot 
have they all been having baths 
how should i know 
mr  barrow  don t you think you
should speak to his lordship 
  about what 
  well  it s not right  surely 
for us to be humiliated
in this way 
well  what could he do about it 
is the staff
always ridden over roughshod
whenever royalty come to stay 
why do they bring
so many servants with them 
maybe it s because they go
from house to house
around the county
and they need to know
things are done
the way they like 
  as if we couldn t manage that 
  we re not footballs 
mr  bates 
and we don t deserve a kicking 
but what are we
to say to barrow  after all 
he s done nothing wrong 
he s done nothing at all 
that s the problem 
but it feels very unfair 
oh  i see 
  so it s now 
  i ve sent down
for mr  barrow to join us 
milord 
you wanted to see me  milord 
mr  carson 
what brings you here 
well  this is the thing 
carson is going to move
back into the house
for the royal visit 
what 
you are coming back here
as butler
when i am the butler here 
yes  uh  that is   
can i ask how long
this has been planned  milord 
well  i wouldn t say
it s been exactly planned 
because i don t quite understand
where it leaves me 
  well  you can be a sort of   
  with your permission 
i d prefer not to be
a  sort of  anything  milord 
i will surrender my position
for the duration of the visit 
if i must 
and serve you again
when their majesties
have gone  if you so wish 
  please don t think that   
  by the way 
the boiler s playing up 
and there s no hot water 
god  that s all we need 
now  barrow   
not to worry  the plumber
will soon have it mended 
milady 
and we ll bring water jugs
up to the bedrooms tonight
and in the morning 
it can t be that hard 
we did it for 300 years 
thank you  carson 
well  that went well 
will you sack him 
no  as a matter of fact 
i was quite interested 
i never thought of him
as a man of principle before 
i ll have to tell him
i m only ordering
for the servants  hall 
i m afraid
i ve got his hopes up 
aha 
oh  speak of the devil 
come in  come in  i was
just saying you ll be wanting
  to finalize the order 
  were you  indeed 
honestly  no one in the village
  can talk about anything else 
  of course 
oh  now  i know it s
a bit of a liberty 
but i ve made a list
of all the ingredients
of your favorite dishes 
i know them well enough
after all these years 
but some things
will have to be brought in 
so we should really
get on with it 
oh  well  i appreciate
everything you ve done 
mr  bakewell   
my heart is fit to burst 
i don t mind telling you 
i shall have fed
the king emperor
from my own shop 
if only my father were alive 
he d be so proud of me 
he would 
well  i i m sure he d be proud
of you anyway  mr  bakewell 
oh  no  no  not like this  no 
this is the peak of my career 
well  the peak
of my life  really 
everyone s so jealous 
oh  now  i ve put ticks
next to the ones
i think you ll go for 
  now  the thing is   
  i m guessing the luncheon
will be for around a dozen 
of course 
the dinner will be larger 
let s say 30 or thereabouts 
you ll correct me if i m wrong 
  well  you see   
  you re not wrong  mr  bakewell 
but we ll say
if the numbers change 
the pavlova s not realistic 
we d be safer
with a charlotte russe 
we can do most
of the work before 
and i shall be serving 
think of that 
  i ve danced with a man
who s danced with a girl  
  who s danced
with the prince of wales  
    i m crazy with excitement  
  no  stop it  mr  molesley 
  completely off the rails   
all of my suppliers
are so excited 
oh  mrs  patmore 
i shall never be able
to thank you enough 
not if i live to be 100 
i feel like a liar 
i should go back 
and lower yourself
to a kitchen skivvy
in the eyes of the village 
never mind ruining
mr  bakewell s year 
you ll do no such thing 
no maid  no valet 
no nanny  even 
it s 1927 
we re modern folk 
nanny will take care
of marigold 
and anna can look after you 
really  can she 
of course 
just like the old days 
granny s here  and isobel 
and we re paying a call this
afternoon on princess mary 
oh  has my new ball dress
arrived 
not yet  but it will 
hello  mary 
how are you 
how long have you worked
for her majesty  miss lawton 
  six years 
  how interesting 
i expect you re a skilled
needlewoman for that job 
well  i ve had no complaints 
i trained under madame lucile 
her majesty wanted
a professional dressmaker 
and they found you 
my reputation found me 
oh 
come on  you two 
it s nearly 3 00 
we ought to get ready 
  will the princess be at the parade 
  thank you 
  they both will 
  what time are they expecting us 
i always find her rather sad 
princess mary 
well  she is royal 
royal women are not meant
to grin like cheshire cats 
well  they don t have
to look miserable 
well  to you 
she looks miserable 
to me  she looks dignified 
doesn t that say it all 
how comforting
to see you here  carson 
what prompted you to take up
the flaming sword again 
i felt i should go where i
could do the most good  milady 
wise words for all of us 
her royal highness is here 
the marchioness of hexham 
the countess of grantham 
the lady mary talbot 
your royal highness 
please  sit down  lady grantham 
i suppose you re in turmoil
because of my parents  visit 
i do sympathize 
we don t need
to explain it to you 
just don t paint anything 
they re sick
of the smell of new paint 
i hope it s not too late 
are you living here now  ma am 
no  no  we re still
at goldsborough 
but lord harewood s
not well  so   
we ve come to run the visit and the ball 
oh  hello 
hello  my darlings

and don t bring them
down again tonight 
  yes  milord 
  but they were only   
thank you  nanny 
  please  nanny 
  no  we re going 
you remember lady grantham
and her daughters 
lady grantham 
they want us to bring the boys
to the parade 
no  they d only cause a ruckus 
we were hoping
you would both stay
for dinner that night 
lord lascelles 
no  i m afraid not 
well   
i ll leave you to it 
well  i suppose
i better let you get started 
  so i ll be on me way 
  aren t you gonna wish me luck 
you don t look as if you need me
to wish you luck  mr  sellick 
or anyone else  for that matter 
you don t know what i need 
and i don t intend to find out 
do we need
to cut the grass again 
they re doing it
tomorrow morning 
hello  mr  branson  ah 
getting ready
for their majesties  i see 
  that s right  this is lord hexham 
  ah 
may i present major chetwode 
  are you here for the parade 
  i am  i m staying at the pub 
  milord 
  excuse me 
or are you here
to keep an eye on me 
i was rather hoping you d be
my guide for the ceremony 
would you like a drink 
i ll join you in a minute 
well  well done 
  who s he 
  i don t really know 
army  perhaps 
or maybe a civil servant 
but i ll drink with him
and try and put his mind
at rest 
what does he want 
maybe to make sure i m a leopard
who has changed his spots 
what about you  milady 
  is everything ready 
  no 
and my heart is pounding 
by the way 
have you seen the silver box
from the table by the fire
in the drawing room 
my grandmother used to keep
playing cards in it 
i know the one 
  is it missing 
  yes 
and so is the little cupid
from the mantelshelf 
oh  they must have been taken
downstairs for cleaning 
i was just coming to you 
milady 
oh  don t worry  i m fine 
  if that s all  milady 
  i suppose 
can you manage the jug
and basin 
or are they too heavy 
no  no  i can do it 
oh  how s the boiler 
i m sure they ll fix it soon 
bertie was with tom earlier 
you don t think tom
would ever try to make trouble 
why do you say that 
well  bertie says
there s some army type
who has him under surveillance 
tom likes to shock  that s all 
he d never be disloyal
to this family  never 
shall we go down 
yes  let s 
so  i said to her 
 listen  lady 
there s a little one here
  who still needs turning  
  oh 
careful  mr  sellick 
you ll make daisy blush 
takes more than that
to make me blush 
  now  get that down you 
  you deserve that 
  it s very late 
  well  i ve got to get it done 
and i don t mind long hours 
i  uh  mean to build
me own business 
and you can t do that
working 9 00 to 5 00 
these water jugs
nearly killed me 
how did we manage
in the old days 
well  maybe people
were tougher then 
maybe they expected less
from life 
well  i expect a lot from life 
so do i 
and i mean to have it  too 
are you still here 
mr  sellick s been working hard
for hours
for our benefit  andy 
then it s time he went home 
is the savory ready 
take this 
mmm 
he s right  the new pump
should arrive around 9 00 
  i ll be here 
  so will we 
ta ra 
that was mama  she s in london 
  she s staying with rosamund 
  she can t be 
she was here for lunch 
she didn t say anything 
she went up this afternoon 
she ll be back tomorrow 
so i ve asked her
to come for tea 
you must persuade her
to leave maud bagshaw alone 
i don t believe even mama
will pick a quarrel
in front of the king 
i wonder if he can come early 
are you excited 
i am a bit  are you 
would it be common to admit it 
not to an american 
here we go  mr  carson 
leave this to me 
i am monsieur courbet 
and this is mrs  webb 
the housekeeper 
ah  follow that path 
and it ll take you
into the kitchen courtyard 
i said  i am monsieur courbet 
chef to their majesties 
well done  charlie 
always start
as you mean to go on 
this way  gentlemen 
  miss lawton 
  i was just looking round 
it s a beautiful house 
you ve seen many that are finer 
that s what i came for 
but we shouldn t be in here 
really 
prepare for your
battle with the barbarians 
oh 
you  uh  where can i put this 
don t tempt me 
we ve cleared some space
in the scullery 
and that cupboard 
what a lot of fuss over nothing 
well  where s our order
from mr  bakewell 
follow me 
well  how did you manage it 
a gardener helped me carry
everything in  so no one saw 
i suppose you could sell the lot
and use the money
to pay mr  bakewell 
don t worry 
they can eat it gradual
when the visit s over 
ah  it s done  mrs  patmore 
the new pump s installed 
hail the conquering hero 
it s mrs  hughes
you should be telling 
or mr  carson  not them 
it s all right  mr  sellick 
we ll see the news
gets through  thanks 
i would not feed it to my dog 
but i don t need
your help  mrs  hughes 
i just want to know where
their majesties are sleeping
so miss stinson
can prepare the rooms 
then i will show you  mrs  webb 
because  without my help 
you will not find them 
is it always like this 
a royal visit is like a swan
on a lake 
grace and serenity above 
demented kicking down below 
i wish i could get away 
i ve got tomorrow night off
when mr  miller arrives 
told my mum i d look in 
why don t you come to york
with me 
  we could have a drink 
  you should go 
  you re not on duty 
  that settles it  then 
i ll come find you
when i m released 
we can borrow a car 
mrs  webb 
i am the housekeeper here 
you are not housekeeper
so long as
his majesty is under this roof 
yes  but he s not here yet 
is he 
it s like living in a factory 
it reminds me of our days
as a convalescent home
during the war 
i enjoyed that  although
i always feel guilty saying so 
where s tom 
  daddy s in the village 
  again 
  what s he playing at 
  oh  i saw tom
looking very stern
as i came up the drive 
i hope he s not building a bomb 
many a true word
is spoken in jest 
we think he s being tailed
by special branch 
nonsense 
  mama  how was london 
  oh  fine  fine 
what were you there for 
  oh  various things 
  but you hate london 
whoever told you that 
now  when do you want me
tomorrow 
12 00 at the latest 
they arrive at half past 
but  mama  you must promise
not to attack maud bagshaw 
well  i can t ignore her 
  she is my cousin 
  exactly 
greet her as a cousin 
and leave it at that 
  i ll think about it 
  but even if she has
left everything to an outsider 
what could we do 
challenge the will 
on what basis 
undue influence 
but how could you know that 
and how would you prove it 
we d find a friendly judge 
friendly or corrupt 
whichever does the trick 
are you here
for dinner  mama 
it s a buffet 
  well  i m not changed 
  we won t change 
either  so you just need
to take off your hat 
you talk as if that were easy 
where s the paper knife 
the silver one
with my regimental crest 
they won t help tonight 
apparently 
they won t lift a finger 
but then  my food
is only fit for servants 
well  at least your young hero
seems to have sorted out
the water 
he s not my hero 
yes 
why did you call him that 
oh  it was just a joke 
  but why s it funny 
  oh  andy  leave it 
  but this is a rabbit hutch 
  don t look at me 
mr  courbet  you couldn t
swing a cat in my room 
gentlemen  please 
i m sure you ll find   
out of my way 
i will have a bath 
and then i will decide 
perhaps i will find a hotel 
where can we eat 
somewhere apart 
uh  why not
in the servants  hall 
we never eat
with the resident staff 
  excuse me 
  the water s cold 
what s happening 
th this is impossible 
we can t stay here
with no hot water 
  are you crazy 
  but the boiler was fixed today 
it was hot an hour ago 
well  it s cold now 
why are you
here again  mr  carson 
so you could keep control
when i would fail 
was that it  i i forget 
you    mr  barrow 
would you mind 
i m not on duty  mr  carson 
you are 
sorry  sir 
what do you want 
since you are in my room 
sitting at my desk 
it is for me to ask
what you want 
nothing from you 
i would remind you that i have
been in charge of downton
for many years 
mr  carson 
you are a retired servant
in a minor provincial house 
serving an
undistinguished family 
your history
is of no interest to me 
now  if you will excuse me 
so  what would you
like me to do 
i would like you to find
a good book
and read it until we leave 
mr  carson  you d better come
and see this 
it s well and truly damaged 
  can you mend it in time 
  oh  yeah 
but somebody should tell them
someone wanted to wreck
the royal visit 
they ought to know 
  has the dress arrived 
  not yet 
  what am i going to wear 
  carson  what is it 
uh  some folding chairs   
well  a great many chairs
have been delivered  milady 
they re at the back door 
anna thought
you should be told at once 
she s right 
they re for the parade 
and we ll have
to set them out tonight 
there ll be no time tomorrow 
the villagers will start
arriving from 9 00 onwards 
i m not sure fate
is on our side 
poor little mary 
have we let her
take on too much 
yes  you re right 
come on 
we should lend her a hand 
well  you can t go out in this 
of course we can 
good night  mama 
remember to pray for us 
mainly for better weather 
i ll put in a word 
of course  little mary could
hammer in a tent peg
with her teeth 
i wonder who she got that from 
you know  i m always surprised
when you praise me 
i m surprised to hear
that i have 
as if things aren t bad enough
without a thunderstorm 
we ll manage 
i ve roped in mr  molesley 
and andy s gone for the truck 
but  well  mr  bates can t help 
and mr  barrow has vanished 
ditto  lord hexham s
out looking for mr  branson 
we ll have to do our best
without them 
you re not going yourself 
well  how else will they know
what to do 
then i ll fetch our coats 
well  you don t have to come 
of course i do 
i ll just tell mr  bates
where i ve gone 
you re a good friend
to me  anna 
i hope we re good friends
to each other  milady 
  this should be the last of them 
  great 
okay  give me that 
mr  molesley 
  can you chuck us the rope 
  here you go 
  tie it down  make sure it s tight 
  here we are 
  all set and ready 
  oh  papa 
dickie  you re so kind 
but are you sure 
you ll be soaked to the skin
and filthy 
well  what s that to us 
we re hunting men 
  come on 
  you don t need to come  my dear 
we can manage it between us 
of course i m coming 
come along 
cheer up  molesley 
the villagers and guests
will watch from both sides
of the dais 
and there ll be seats at
the front kept for the family 
  i ll join you there 
  i suppose so 
we ll meet in the high street
where we planned 
don t bring anyone 
come on your own 
it s all ridiculous  of course 
it s a lot of fuss over nothing 
what  i thought you
were here to check
i didn t do anything foolish
and spoil things 
  in what way 
  i don t know 
throw eggs or wave a banner
or shout 
will you 
no 
but i m starting
to wonder about you 
i don t throw eggs 
  have another 
  yes 
  same again  please 
  right you are  sir 
we ll bring a special chair up
for the queen
after breakfast when 
hopefully 
it will have stopped raining 
i shall carry it myself  milord 
  well  what about the king 
  well  he ll be on his horse 
but suppose it s still raining 
god will make it stop 
is that tom 
has he been in the pub
the whole evening 
well  the day has dawned 
and the weather proves
conclusively
that god is a monarchist 
who could doubt it  milady 
here they come now 
mr  molesley 
i m all right 
just need a minute
to catch my breath 
your majesties 
welcome to downton abbey 
we re glad to be here 
lady grantham 
grantham 
you remember
lord grantham s mother 
  hello  lady grantham 
  oh 
oh  can i help you 
someone must  sir  or i   
i may never rise again 
thank you 
  my daughter  lady mary talbot 
  hmm 
the marquess and marchioness
of hexham 
mr  tom branson 
lord and lady merton 
this is kind of you 
  lord grantham 
  oh  not at all 
it is a great honor 
i m sure you know 
but princess mary
and lord lascelles
will be joining us
for luncheon and the parade 
they re both coming 
as far as i m aware 
what a relief 
please forget i said that 
said what  ma am 
  cousin maud 
  violet 
are we going to kiss 
i m glad you want to kiss me 
it wasn t quite what you said
when i last heard from you 
wasn t quite how i felt
when i wrote 
can i help you at all 
thanks 
the others all shot off 
and i m not sure
if this is the right way 
just come with me 
what s your part in this circus 
i m lady bagshaw s maid 
oh  well  then it s this door 
you just ask for mrs  hughes 
  she ll look after you 
  thank you 
oh  have you tasted the water 
only for body 
never for drinking 
ah  this has just arrived
for lady edith 
lady hexham these days 
mr  bates  but   
thank you  albert 
it s a relief 
i want the milk now 
i want the egg yolks now 
i want the olive oil now 
and i want
the vanilla pod now 
he wants a clip
around the ear    now 
careful  mrs  patmore 
uh  right  who s taking
this up  mr  molesley 
uh  there s no need for you
to meddle  mrs  hughes 
  we will see to it 
  meddle 
i don t believe i m meddling
in my own house  thank you 
andrew  yes 
  you take that one 
  but it s not your house  is it 
so  would you like to go
and sit down 
  now  just a minute 
  uh  you leave those 
put them down 
for heaven s sake 
go after them 
i really must protest 
my staff are   
keep them down here  mr  carson 
that goes for you  too 
stay out of our way 
you ve seen their majesties 
let it be enough 
  excuse me 
  wait a minute 
what what are you playing at 
hang on 
what    
things seem calmer in the north 
you mean after the strike  sir 
yes  if calmer means
more resigned 
i m not sure
what the future holds 
hmm 
and you  lady grantham 
were you affected
by the general strike 
well  my maid was rather curt
with me while it was on  sir 
but  you know 
she is a communist at heart 
so i suppose
it was only to be expected 
wasn t the princess joining us 
uh  they telephoned 
lord lacelles has been
held up by something 
uh  but they are planning
to come for the parade 
i imagine the servants  bedrooms
are quite pleasant here 
why  are you worried
for your maid 
how clever of you 
lucy is more of a companion
than a maid 
i d hate for her
to be uncomfortable 
of course 
i really have to go 
you can t embarrass mama 
i m sorry  but you must wait
until we stand 
lord hexham 
how is northumberland 
as beautiful as ever  sir 
can it spare you  do you think 
well  that was humiliating 
go on 
oh  well  we might as well
all go for a walk 
we cannot challenge the way
a royal visit is conducted 
mrs  patmore 
  i m not so sure 
  why don t we all meet
  back here after the parade 
  anna  mr  bates 
there must be no trouble or
disloyal tomfoolery of any kind 
do you hear me 
we ll meet in the wine cellar 
tell the others 
now  i m walking
to mr  bakewell s 
  if you ve any errands 
  no 
well  then 
  we should get moving 
  ah    of course  sir 
  yes 
  here we go 
ma am 
i m so looking forward to this 
  okay 
  good lunch  i thought 
what was the king saying
earlier  i couldn t hear 
he s planning a tour for the
prince of wales next march 
it ll take in most
of the african colonies
  and finish in cape town 
  and he wants you to go 
he thinks
i m a steadying influence 
how long would you be away 
about three months 
i can t believe my luck 
can you 
i think we re parked
around the back 
tom 
what on earth
are you doing here 
i might ask you
the same question 
go back  or you ll ruin things 
isn t that what you re doing 
you don t know what i m doing 
  who s this 
  this is my sister in law 
lady mary talbot 
i told you to come alone 
leave this to me 
  tom 
  get the gun 
there he is 
  hold still 
  got him 
calm down 
you re not going anywhere 
  hold still 
  are you all right  sir 
  high treason  that is 
  your ladyship 
why are you even here 
i didn t suspect him myself
until last night 
how was i to know you d
given up on a free ireland 
isn t it free now 
not with the bloody crown
around its neck 
get in 
  take him away 
  all right  sir 
i m not impressed
you all decided
i was a royal assassin 
i didn t 
it was really the others 
if you ll follow us
to the station 
why didn t you tell us 
i thought he d come
to check up on me
and didn t want
to drag you into it 
i assumed he d back off
if i answered his questions
and met him for a drink 
but last night at the pub 
i realized he wanted to use me
to get close to the king 
royal salute 
carry    swords 
sorry 
excuse me 
we thought you d miss it 
i was just in time 
i don t know why i bothered 
  shh 
  oh  quiet 
your majesty 
the yorkshire hussars
are formed up 
ready and awaiting
your inspection 
where is he 
he s not feeling well 
wasn t he out shooting
yesterday 
  what do you want me to say 
  nothing 
you have to let me leave him 
we will not talk about it now 
is that your maid 
that s right  lucy 
don t you call her
by her surname 
she s been with me so long 
it s so strange 
  he seemed so english 
  and so he was 
a pillar of the establishment 
until the notion
of irish independence
took him over to the other side 
that s where i came in 
he d heard my sympathies lay
with ireland and the republic 
don t they 
not at any cost 
i m a law and order man
these days 
that s what you lot
have done to me 
so  will there be a great splash
all over the newspapers 
poor papa 
oh  no  you ll find
there isn t a whisper
about this anywhere 
an establishment cover up 
i don t believe
in conspiracy theories 
yes 
  do you    do you write 
  i try 
ah  miss smith 
did mrs  hughes sort you out 
she did 
and have you enjoyed the parade 
do you work at the house 
not exactly 
i sell cars 
and i help with the estate 
lord grantham
is my father in law 
oh  i do beg your pardon  sir 
oh  no  please  let me explain 
i started here as a chauffeur 
you must be
lady sybil s husband 
i am 
lady bagshaw and i
followed the story 
we were so sad when she died 
how long ago was it 
seven years  or nearly 
  my god 
  i m sorry 
  it s still painful 
  not in that way 
it doesn t hurt anymore 
but it s still there 
  can i ask you something 
  of course 
was it hard 
coming up like that 
joining the family 
very hard 
between my old world
and the new one 
sometimes i didn t know
who i was 
but you do now 
i think so  yes 
i came to terms with it 
why 
i m just curious 
quickly  everyone  quick 
come on  quickly  mr  barrow 
can somebody tell me
what s going on  anna 
  shh 
  what s going on 
what are we all
doing down here 
shh  go inside 
they can t hear us in there 
this is most improper 
yes  why why have you
got us all here 
  yeah 
  i will tell you 
mr  bates and i   
we want to defend
downton s honor 
in what way 
would you like a repeat
of how you were all
treated at luncheon 
no  i bloody well would not 
andrew 
there are ladies present 
we think we should fight back 
i don t like the sound of this 
i do not like this at all 
anna  tell them 
we are going to clear the way
so you cook and serve dinner
for the king and queen
at downton abbey 
as you should 
well  oh  my god 
is this a revolution 
shall i fetch the pitchforks 
no  we re serious  mr  moseley 
but do you know
what mr  courbet s
brought in for tonight 
mm  never mind that 
we ve got our own supplies 
and you can leave
mr  courbet to me 
what do you want us to do 
don t bother with the maids
and valets 
we ve no quarrel with them 
but we need to get rid
of the royal butler
  for the night 
  the page of the backstairs 
if you don t mind  mr  bates 
and the footmen need to be
out of commission
from 7 00 until you finish
serving them 
this is treason 
well  what can we do about  em 
well  we could lock them
in the attic 
any more talk like that 
and we ll all end up
in botany bay 
and did you enjoy
being pushed around
and passed over
and told to stay down here
by mr  wilson 
i will play
no active part in this 
well  suppose his majesty sees
what s going on
and is displeased 
why  do you think
i m not capable of cooking
a decent dinner 
oh  no  of course not 
but but i   
i ll see to the footmen 
what are you going to do 
you ll find out 
so  does this mean
we re back on duty after all 
  me and mr  moseley 
  and albert as well 
you know where to find
the state liveries 
right 
  well  come on  daisy 
  will i pour wine
for the queen s sweet lips 
any more of that 
and we ll lock you in the attic 
i don t know why
you re bothering 
what about that mrs  webb
who keeps telling us
she s the housekeeper 
don t you worry about mrs  webb 
i am more than a match
for mrs  webb 
i still don t know
how you re going to manage
mr  courbet 
well  there s  um   
i m just going upstairs
to lie down 
can you get things ready
for when i come back 
when will that be  o mighty one 
wake me in half an hour
if i m not already
in the kitchen 
trust us 
tell us about your maid 
lucy is the daughter of   
david s army servant 
jack smith 
and  like my husband 
he died in the boer wars 
so you looked after his child 
lucy had no mother  you see 
so i gave her a home 
that s very generous 
generosity that has been amply
returned  i can assure you 
i m glad 
you don t sound very glad 
oh  goodness 
i thought everyone
was in the drawing room 
i ve been dodging it 
i m afraid 
i suppose i ought to get back 
can i get someone for you 
no  thank you 
you re the widower of the
youngest daughter  aren t you 
i ve heard of you  mister   
branson 
tom branson 
and who are you 
ah  i should know 
but i m no good
at that sort of thing 
well  i suppose you can t
be expected to know everyone 
mm 
did you enjoy the parade 
i m afraid
i missed it completely 
i got distracted 
  what a shame 
  well  to be honest 
i m not much of a royalist 
although i probably
shouldn t say that out loud 
certainly not to a stranger 
that seems odd  as the crawleys
would die for the crown
if they had to 
you can love people
you disagree with 
and you love them 
they re decent at the core 
people can be decent at the core
but very difficult to live with 
true enough 
and they re silly  too 
and snobbish at times 
and i wouldn t give tuppence
for their politics 
but i ve learned to be happy
with all of that 
and besides   
they re my daughter s family 
and she lives here 
i nearly took her away once 
but she belongs here now 
i spent so much of my life
not belonging anywhere 
that s important to me 
i suppose  in the end 
it s deciding
what s important  isn t it 
you ve given me a great deal
to think about  mr  branson 
good things  i hope 
that may be so  but   
now we must go in 
we must change 
and you leave in the morning 
i wonder if we might have
a talk later 
we ll find a cozy spot 
and robert can join us 
i won t be interrogated  violet 
please  don t miss the chance
to settle things between you 
very well 
but now i must go 
that was helpful 
thank you 
well  i told you
i wanted to help 
well  thanks to you 
we have her cornered 
mr  wilson 
there s a telephone call
for you 
for me 
but  sir harry  they wouldn t
get to london until 9 00 
it doesn t matter 
the ball at clarence house
won t start till 10 00 
what ball at clarence house 
the duke of connaught s 
what are you playing at  wilson 
i m not questioning you  sir 
not if it s what
the duke of connaught wishes 
but how do i manage here 
don t they have footmen
at downton 
yes  there are footmen 
but won t his majesty   
his majesty won t give
a tinker s cuss 
  now  do as i say 
  of course  sir harry  at once 
everything all right 
mr  wilson 
i need to see my footmen
and the house footmen
and the hall boy 
uh  when is the next train
to london 
i hope it s not bad news 
not bad  exactly 
but irregular 
very irregular  indeed 
i ll get drummed out of the
regiment if they ever find out 
well  you sounded
convincing to me 
oh  i m very good
at doing sir harry barnston 
  i can assure you 
  what if mr  wilson rings back 
no one queries
sir harry s orders 
but if he did 
well  then they d
uncover the trick 
but they couldn t
trace it back to me 
right  shall we go into york 
sorry to miss out
on the fun  in a way 
where shall i wait for you
when you re with your parents 
we ll find a pub 
did you manage
to speak to someone 
i got hold
of madame seymour s assistant 
they ve sent you the wrong one 
it s similar in style
but not  as you can see 
  in size 
  well  where s my dress now 
on its way to new york 
well  that s that  then 
wonderful 
everything s going wrong
for me today 
  milady 
  oh  never mind 
how are things downstairs 
any better 
a bit better  yes  milady 
in fact 
i ought to be getting back 
of course 
oh  one thing 
the painted glass
that used to sit by my bed 
was it broken while i was away 
leave it with me  milady 
and the dress 
you wouldn t mind a fitting
later tonight  would you 
i don t understand 
who with 
i just had an idea 
i shouldn t think so 
not if she knows
what s good for her 
oh  i   
i m sorry to interrupt 
how clever of you to find me 
well  not really 
i lived here 40 years 
i assume this is your maid 
  yes  this is lucy smith 
  oh 
good evening  smith 
good evening  milady 
  shall i go 
  no  not for me 
not for me 
i m delighted to meet you 
i ve heard so much about you 
is there something you want 
hmm 
oh  just just to see
you re comfortable
and to confirm
our little chat for later 
i live my own life now  violet 
i m not what i was 
my father is gone 
my husband is gone 
i see no reason
not to do what i want 
well  that doesn t mean
there is no reason 
merely that you cannot see it 
i think lady merton is right 
we ll have it out 
once and for all 
but now i must go
to her majesty 
hmm 
you re not to speak 
you re not to think 
just follow my lead 
their majesties must not know
they re being served
by anyone different 
do you hear me 
i don t want them
to even notice 
we will do our best  mr  wilson 
i don t want your best 
i want far better
than your best 
is everything under control
here  mr  wilson 
i gather the others
caught the train 
and this is
what we re left with 
mind you don t disgrace
the state livery  albert 
of course  mr  carson 
where is monsieur courbet 
  i came in here to see him 
  uh  he went out 
so i thought i d better get on
with dinner  wasn t i right 
  no  you were not right  you were entirely wrong 
  oh 
oh  i m sorry 
i don t know h how
that happened 
well  i shall
have to go and change 
we ll sort this out
when i return 
andy 
if you don t
want me to  i won t 
but you ve already said
that you will 
because it s a fantastic chance 
it didn t occur to me
you d mind 
i don t  exactly 
not in that way 
then in what way 
i wasn t going to tell you 
i wasn t going
to tell anyone  but   
i might be pregnant 
oh  darling 
how marvelous 
how fabulous 
my heart is bursting 
oh  well  that s
exactly what i don t want 
  it could easily go wrong 
  oh  but but if it doesn t   
then i ll give birth
just as you set off on
your three month colonial tour 
why didn t you say this
when i first mentioned it 
you d agreed
before i had the chance 
secrets always muddle things 
oh  yes  that s right 
let s make it my fault 
well  i ll tell the king
i can t go 
and he ll accept that  will he 
hello 
it s miss smith  isn t it 
we were talking about you
earlier  weren t we 
oh  tom 
what luck 
you know miss smith  don t you 
come along  mary 
are you all right 
has something happened 
old lady grantham came in
while we were dressing 
i think the stage is set
for a fight later  about me 
she thinks lady bagshaw
means to favor me 
  and she doesn t approve 
  what business is it of hers 
lady bagshaw
must have her reasons 
and that s good enough for me 
going down  tom 
good night 
ah  there you are  miss lawton 
i hope you re having
a well earned rest 
well  there s
always less for me to do
when miss aplin arrives 
but we must be ready
for the ball tomorrow 
that s what i want
to talk about 
later this evening  when i
go up to help lady hexham 
i want you to come with me 
fit a new ball dress
and sew it overnight
so it s done before you leave
in the morning 
why on earth would i do that 
the box and cupid
from the drawing room 
the library paper knife 
lady hexham s painted glass 
never took the glass 
then it must have been broken 
like she said 
but you took something
from that room 
what was it 
a patch box
from the dressing table 
i d like them all back  please 
i can t sew a dress in a night 
when would i sleep 
when you get to harewood
tomorrow 
and don t think i won t tell 
 queen s dresser a thief  
that ll make headlines
from here to peru 
the marquess
and marchioness of granby 
sir william and lady ingleby 
where are the royal footmen 
they ve had to go back
to london 
all of them 
wasn t that rather unlucky 
unlucky for some  milady 
the earl and countess
of scarborough 
ah 
for goodness  sake 
help me 
will someone help me 
i m going on to turton s
in a minute 
do you know it 
uh   
i m chris webster  by the way

for a very long time 
perhaps he s found
better things to do 
and 
why don t you come with me 
you know you want to 
excuse me  sir 
my name s barrow 
if someone comes looking for me 
could you tell him i ve gone 
  shall i say where to 
  never mind that    turton s 
i just cannot understand
where mr  wilson has got to 
never mind him 
what about you 
surely  you can t really mean
to leave his majesty unattended 
but is it for me to attend him 
well  you ve got
your breeches on 
  well  i have  but   
  mr  carson 
this is your destiny 
you know as much  and so do i 
now  accept it proudly 
and walk into that room
with your head held high 
you can do it  mr  carson 
please tell me what is going on 
mr  courbet is missing 
ditto mr  wilson 
and your footmen are
on their way up to london 
i am still in charge here 
no  mrs  webb 
these are my people now 
so please  uh  go back to the
servants  hall and sit down 
or would you rather
ruin the evening 
that s telling her 
mrs  patmore forgot
to send up the sauce 
  and i ve got the chopped egg 
  oh  that s kind
  when it s not your job 
  nonsense 
we must all pull our weight
tonight for downton s glory 
now  are you ready  boys 
ready as we ll ever be 
we ll be fine  mrs  hughes 
what about you  mr  molesley 
i know i m

you haven t got any lines 
  you re on 
  oh  right 
and  mr  molesley 
remember to breathe 
breathe  yeah 
gentlemen 
i m glad you re here 
mr  carson 
i must go
where my king needs me 
  hello

some new blood here 
hello 
you re a very charming
young man 
hey

i can t believe this 
i ve never seen
anything like it 
there s a first time
for everything 
i know  but   
here  come dance with me 
  what d you say 
  i said   there s your friend  
no  my friend s over there 
i wish i could tell them how
grateful they should be to you 
you were every bit as brave
as i was 
mary 
you re talking
in the wrong direction 
don t worry about granny 
she s getting ready
to give cousin maud a grilling 
mainly  i suspect 
about her maid 
i think lady bagshaw sees her
as more than just her maid 
oh  i m sure she does 
and that s what
granny s afraid of 
i might as well admit   
i like her 
good 
don t let them put you off 
tom  you re looking
pleased with yourself 
he was just praising
lady bagshaw s maid 
well  uh  how did she contrive
to make your acquaintance 
she didn t contrive anything 
we met by chance 
what simpletons men are 
this is good 
and i thought
something else was planned 
but it is excellent 
so  a well done to old courbet 
  oh  yes 
  yes  very delicious 
this wasn t monsieur courbet 
your majesty 
mrs  patmore cooked it 
in fact  it is
the downton abbey staff
who are serving you
this evening 
oh 
oh 
i do beg your pardon 
your majesty 
that s quite enough  molesley 
you must give our compliments
to mrs  patmore
and all the staff 
  molesley 
  huh 
her majesty is speaking to you 
with pleasure  your majesty 
that was kind of you  ma am 
i suppose he s excited
that they ve had to take over
from our people 
i wonder what s happened 
whatever may have happened
does not excuse his behavior 
i can assure you 
lady grantham 
we are quite used
to people behaving strangely
when we are near 
  whoa 
  that s it  i ve got you 
the peelers are here 
it s the police 
make sure no one
scarpers  block all the exits 
  what s going on 
  all right  gentlemen 
that s the end of your evening 
shut that music up now 
right 
you are all coming
to the station with us 
we re just having a bit of fun 
officer 
no one s making any trouble 
that s for the judge to decide 
  judge 
  what did you think 
we re gonna slap your wrists
and send you home 
i ve never been here before 
you re here now  right 
gather your things 
you re coming with us 
you dirty perverts  out

sort it out 
  there we are  my dear 
  oh  thank you 
yes  darling

there might be a moment 
i met the maid 
she has maud wound
around her little finger 
  then we need to know why 
  mm 
well  i ll
look forward to it  gentlemen 
  thank you  your majesty 
  milord 
what is it  hexham 
well  your majesty  it s this 
i ve just learned
that lady hexham
is expecting our first child 
but that s wonderful news 
we re not telling anyone
quite yet 
but i thought
you d be interested 
and so i am  congratulations 
the the thing is  sir 
it s due to be born
around the time
the prince and i
will be setting off on tour 
excellent 
please make it register
with him 
help the prince
to understand what it means
to have a real family life 
you can be such an example
to him 
i know it 
very well 
let s get to the point 
robert is my nearest relation
on my father s side 
he is 
but he will not be my heir 
and there we have it 
who will be  can you tell us 
lucy smith  my maid 
what  are you out of your mind 
no  and i know what i m doing 
on the contrary 
you re you re clearly insane 
you should be in an asylum 
how like you 
a word of resistance 
and you slash with your saber 
it is lucky for miss smith
that i do not own a saber 
so  this is truly your choice 
lucy has taken care of me
for many years 
i wish to show my gratitude 
with the family house 
with the family estate 
you belong in a straitjacket 
to treat your maid
as a blood relation
is to unpick every fiber
of the english way of life 
what piffle you talk 
  oh 
  please  there is no need to argue 
i never argue 
i explain 
face it  violet 
i ll outlive you anyway 
so it need trouble you
no further 
and now   
i must attend her majesty 
game  set and match
to lady bagshaw 
not while i m the umpire 
we had a few drinks 
and mr  barrow thought
it d be fun to play a trick
on the queers  that s all 
he was only in there
for five minutes 
dancing the tango
with another man 
come on  sergeant 
it was a joke 
turns your stomach  though 
  relieved to hear it 
  yeah  i d rather be dead
if i thought i was one of them 
but what can i say to the earl 
what earl 
the earl of grantham 
mr  barrow is his butler 
of course 
you ll want to see proof
of my identity 
  was it you who got me out 
  no 
the good fairy came down
on a moonbeam 
how did you know where i d gone 
the landlord told me 
waited outside 
followed you here 
then i showed the sergeant
my card 
and that seemed
to settle things 
 the royal household  
he must have loved that 
i m a   
i m afraid
i ve been a silly boy 
you just need to be
a bit more circumspect
in future  mr  barrow 
could you please remove it 
milady 
leaving the pins in place 
can you really get it done
before you go 
  i don t see how 
  she ll finish it 
  won t you 
  i ll do my best 
i m sure you ll manage 
by the way  i think i know
what happened to the cupid
from the drawing room  milady 
really  was it missing 
your dress will be ready
in the morning  milady 
thank you 
i don t know how
you persuaded her 
she s nice  really 
when you get to know her 
is there anything else 
only to say
that you re a genius 
  good night 
  good night 
i m afraid
i didn t get anywhere 
well  that s that 
just because the king
doesn t see that a man
has any part to play
in childbearing 
well  he doesn t 
but you d think he d know
that one likes to be around 
you can t just tell him no 
darling  i m one of
the senior peers in the land 
what do you think that means 
what do you think i m sworn to 
lady bagshaw 
could i have a word
before you ring for your maid 
does lucy know
that you re her mother 
she does 
for years 
i said i was her godmother 
but i told her the truth
on her 18th birthday 
how old was she when jack died 
six 
she d lived with jack
and his mother until then 
but i took her into the house 
and she went
to the village school
until  eventually 
she became my maid 
i suppose
if she d been your ward 
people would have guessed 
exactly 
who takes notice of a servant 
i hid her in plain sight 
did you love jack smith 
everyone should know
a total love at least once 
jack was mine 
my husband was very dull 
you know 
he wasn t a bad man  but   
but he wasn t a clever one 
either 
then he died 
and jack came to see me 
and it began from there 
how daring 
i know it sounds reckless 
but i was 39
when i got pregnant 
i thought i was barren 
of course  i knew i couldn t
tell my father  so   
i went to america 
they must have
thought that wild 
well  little did they know
how wild it really was 
but you were happy with jack 
oh  very 
we had ten years together
before he died 
i d have married him
if i d had the courage 
i was weak 
but you never knew my father 
i suppose royal service
kept you silent on the subject 
yes 
in a way 
but it was cowardice  really 
now  by making lucy my heir 
i will have taken
the first step 
you must tell violet at once 
  i couldn t 
  you re wrong 
as soon as she knows the truth 
she ll fathom your plans
and cease to fight you 
the servants seem to be
enjoying themselves tonight 
especially molesley 
what happened to the royal team 
it s a long story  milady 
but you re right 
we did have fun 
well  i m glad it s gone well
for everyone 
but i don t think
i could face doing it again 
you re not finished yet 
you ve still got the ball
at harewood 
yes  but it won t be our fault
if anything goes wrong 
that s not very cheerful 
the last few days
have made me think 
should we really go on with it 
we re running the house
with too few people as it is 
and half of those here now
will leave soon 
what are you saying  milady 
isn t it time
to chuck in the towel 
lots of people have 
you mean    leave downton 
we could sell it for a school
or an old people s home
or something 
and buy a manor house
with a modest estate
and live a normal life 
is that what you want 
i want everything
to stop being such a struggle 
will the staff stay 
will the farms pay 
what are we going to do
about the roof 
when i was putting up
the chairs in the rain 
i kept thinking 
 what am i doing  
i ll tell you
what you re doing  milady 
you re making a center
for the people who work here 
for this village 
for the county 
downton abbey is the heart
of this community 
and you re keeping it beating 
so you think
we should battle on 
  while there s blood in your veins 
  hmm 
ah  miss smith 
is she settled for the night 
she s more rattled than settled 
and i was right 
there was an argument 
it was about me 
i hear from lord grantham
she s planning
to alter your life
for the better 
he says old lady grantham
was up in arms 
i can imagine 
are you entitled
to your good luck 
do you know why she s doing it 
i do 
and i think it s fair 
go forward in health 
and use your luck wisely 
i have such a feeling
that you can understand
what s going on inside my head
when no one else does
or ever could 
i ll miss our talks 
would you like to write to me 
i could always provide
a shoulder 
may i 
really 
i should be pleased
and flattered if you would 
and now i think it s time
to say good night  mr  branson 
good night  miss smith 
here s to the triumph of downton
and my beautiful wife 
oh  here s to all of you
who brought it off 
here s to mr  carson
for swallowing his principles 
well  i shan t
sleep a wink tonight 
and here s to her majesty
for taking pity on mr  molesley 
for a moment there  i thought
i was headed for the tower 
you re not coming round to  em 
are you 
uh  it was decent of her  daisy 
when she could have let it
spoil things 
not everyone s like robespierre 
let s hear it
for the king and queen 
the king and queen 
i ve got to tell you
something  daisy 
it was me that broke the pump 
i don t know what i was doing 
i was just in a jealous rage 
  why 
  it was that plumber you made eyes at 
i just saw red 
and then when i realized
i d brought him
back to the house 
i went nearly mad 
i did not make eyes 
i liked him  but there was
nothing more to it 
well  i feel a fool now 
you tried to wreck the visit
of the king of england 
you risked being sacked 
you risked ruin   
   just for the love of me 
i just   
my feelings took over 
that s all i can say 
can you forgive me 
forgive you 
oh  andy  i d have done it
myself if i d had the nerve 
don t you see what it means 
we re alike  you and i 
full of passion
for what matters 
i thought
you were easily satisfied 
but i see now you re not 
so we can fight our way
to a better world together 
i m not sure i ve shown
enough gratitude
for what you did 
we have to stick
together  men like us 
that s the point 
i don t know any men like i am 
i ve never just talked
to someone like me 
well  we re talking now 
and it feels good 
just to be two blokes 
having a chat 
not trying to fit in for once 
well  we all have to do
what we must to get by 
but yeah  feels good
to be two ordinary blokes 
will they ever see it our way 
i don t know 
50 years ago  who d have
thought man could fly 
mrs  bates 
well  here s the dress 
we can try it before you leave 
no need  it ll fit 
those are the things you wanted 
why do you do it  miss lawton 
doesn t it ever worry you
that on each table
in this house 
there s an ornament
that you couldn t buy
with a year s wages 
and what s your answer 
because everyone
can t have them 
  no one should have them 
  no 
my answer is 
 why can t i have them 
or some of them  
don t worry 
they won t miss what i take 
i doubt there s more
than one in 100
would even notice they re gone 
but they re not yours 
miss lawton 
and they never will be 
i d give it up if i were you 
what if people were to think
her majesty was light fingered
if things go missing
from every house she stays in 
keep your advice for someone
who s interested  mrs  bates 
those doors play up
something dreadful 
they jam and stick
for no reason 
it s happened to everyone 
why didn t any of you look
for me 
i thought i d seen you go out 
mr  wilson 
i m afraid i was mistaken 
just as you were mistaken
in not waking monsieur courbet 
  we thought he d gone out and all 
  oh 
thank you  mrs  hughes 
uh  a little more marmalade 
if you please 
the footmen have
telephoned this morning 
it seems it was a hoax
that took them up to london 
  but who would do that 
  who  indeed 
we can investigate
when we get to harewood 
i should be careful 
monsieur courbet 
unless you enjoy ridicule 
  what 
  i d say the dinner was a success 
they sent down
their compliments 
so i think it must have been 
well  then 
why call attention to it 
would you show to advantage
in this story  do you think 
but what do we say
if we re asked 
there was a confusion in london 
monsieur courbet was ill 
if i were you 
i wouldn t mention it 
not unless they bring it up 
quite right 
there you are 
i ve been looking everywhere 
what s the matter  darling 
is it something i can help with 
judging by last night 
i doubt it 
i just want to own my own life 
i want to say things that
i think and do what i like 
  don t you now 
  no 
i spend my time entertaining
people who bore me to death
because they re entitled
to sit at our table 
i attend committees
that i haven t chosen
because they ve chosen me 
i used to have a job
that i loved  but not anymore 
and now my husband won t
be there when i have a baby 
the woman in the lodge
is entitled to that 
but i m not 
early warning 
their majesties
are getting ready to leave 
very good  milord 
darling  what s the matter 
nothing you can help with 
can t i try 
oh  uh  we should go up 
their majesties
are on their way 
oh  right 
come on 
up we go 
so  you re off to london 
they ll drop me at the station 
well  i hope
we can keep in touch 
i feel i ve finally
found a friend 
is that what you found 
mr  barrow 
a friend 
  their majesties are going 
  thanks 
i want you to have this 
it s not much 
but i ve had it for years 
it ll remind you of me 
that s the point  isn t it 
so you can think of me
till we meet again 
thank you 
mr  ellis 
you must come 
i hope you enjoy your time
at harewood  sir 
yes  i hope so  too 
it isn t really goodbye
when we ll see you all
this evening 
we re looking forward
to the ball 
harewood
is such a wonderful house 
well  let s mount up  shall we 
  we ll see you later  grantham 
  your majesty 
well done  everyone 
shall we head back in 
mary  what are you
wearing to the ball 
oh  i don t know 
carson  what happened to
the royal servants last night 
hard to say  milord 
they sort of gave up the ghost 
well  you managed splendidly 
although i could have done
without molesley s aria 
but please thank the staff
for saving the day 
oh  uh  mrs  bates 
  excuse me 
  can i ask you something 
what did you give
monsieur courbet 
a double dose
of a sleeping draught
from mr  bakewell s   
in his tea 
i m afraid i made rather a fool
of myself last night 
you could never be a fool to me 
do you mean that  really 
i do 
and i think you know how much 
you re right  mrs  patmore 
it s time i started
to plan my wedding 
well  i don t know
what took you so long 
i wasn t sure before 
but i am now 
well  that s good to hear 
i m happy  mrs  patmore 
i don t often say that 
but i am 
are you very shocked by it all 
i should be  interfering
with the palace staff
on a royal visit   
and me part of it  to boot 
i don t know what came over me 
but 
they had it coming to them 
elsie 
let s face it 
they had it coming in spades 
hello 
what s this 
welcome back  mr  talbot 
hello  carson  mrs  hughes 
do you know where
i ll find lady mary 
after everything that s gone on 
i should think
she ll be lying down  sir 
they all will be 
sounds ominous 
that s nice that he s back
in time for the ball 
and thank the lord
we don t have to organize it 
oh  darling  you don t know
what we ve lived though 
i m sorry i couldn t
get here sooner 
it was the first ship after
the last meeting  i promise 
oh  never mind 
you re here now 
and i don t have to go
to the ball alone
like a sad little wallflower 
well  i ll only come
if you promise
  to dance with me nonstop 
  oh  it s a deal 
  good evening 
  your majesty 
i suppose maud has brought
that scheming little minx
with her 
if you continue in this vein 
you will only make yourself
look stupid 
  what what do you mean 
  what i say 
are you keeping something
from me 
come with me 
what 
why aren t you happy 
i thought you d be delirious 
well  we are happy 
if you mean it  very 
but how will you manage henry 
by altering the way
we manage each other 
and it may not be easy 
but i ve decided
that i m staying with him 
i just don t understand
what changed your mind 
it was something
mr  branson said
about deciding what matters 
for me  the crown matters more
than any of us 
i can make it work 
branson  the irish republican 
oh  you re well informed 
i m better informed
than you know 
so  he persuaded you to do this 
oh  we were talking
after the parade 
oh  there he is 
ah 
say something nice  please 
i have to say  it s
been very quiet without you 
mr  branson 
i wish we had spoken more
while we were at downton abbey 
  do you  sir 
  certainly 
i believe i have more than one
reason to be grateful to you 
more than one 
what was that all about 
i ll tell you when we re alone 
why more than one 
who is she 
that s princess mary 
she was at downton
for the parade yesterday 
didn t you see her 
not at the parade 
but i saw her afterwards
at the tea 
so  you see 
she has brompton blood 
albeit from an unusual angle 
why did you not say this
long ago 
it seemed too great a leap
for you 
well  who do you think i am 
some maiden aunt
who s never left the village 
obviously not 
well  don t think i approve 
because i don t 
but at least i understand 
does miss smith know the truth 
yes  she does 
when i get home 
i will hire another maid 
and lucy can be my companion 
well  that s much more suitable 
and i m afraid
you ll dislike it 
but she says
that she and tom branson
have agreed to correspond 
dislike it 
i will lick the stamps myself 
you are amazing  violet 
you haven t won  you know 
i don t believe in defeat 
but we can hammer this out
when you come back to stay 
you and lucy 
when you ve finished
your tour of duty 
you mean i am once more
a member of this family 
she s right  you know 
brompton is gone 
and you must all learn
to live with it 
i think we can get it back 
for tom  at least 
that s why we need the girl
back here 
oh  violet 
after all these years 
you still astonish me 
oh  good 
i m glad i m a revelation
and not a disappointment 
  it s very important 
  quite right 
  oh  there they are now  do ask 
  ah  yes 
there you are  hexham 
i m sad you can t be part
of the prince s tour 
but we ll find something else
for you to do 
  what 
  sir  i i didn t  um   
i understood why not  uh 
as soon as her majesty
had explained it to me 
congratulations to you both 
you re looking very sunny tonight 
i m happy 
why  does it bother you 
no  but tell me 
what are you playing at
  with tom and cousin maud s famous maid 
  what do you mean 
i heard you
at dinner last night 
what are you up to 
you know she ll inherit
the brompton estate 
  well  so mama told me 
  well  then 
wouldn t you like tom
to have a proper establishment 
oh  you devious cat 
will they be happy 
do you think they will 
oh  i just want a word
with granny 
how long were you
planning to wait
before you told us why
you really went up to london
on wednesday 
since you ask 
i haven t decided 
so  if i tell you now 
will you promise
to keep it to yourself 
i promise 
very well  i   
i had some medical tests
a few weeks ago 
and i went up to london
to hear the results 
  yes 
  and  uh 
i may not have long to live 
it won t be too quick 
but  of course 
you can never get
a london doctor to be precise 
  oh  granny 
  no 
no  no 
my dear  save your tears
for something sad 
th there s nothing sad here 
i have lived a privileged
and an interesting life 
and now it s   
it s time to go 
i m leaving the family
and the place that i treasure
in talented hands 
  well  i know papa will be   
  oh  no  no 
no  i don t mean your father 
i    no  i i love him dearly 
no  i    i mean you 
you are the future of downton 
but i have such doubts  granny 
are we right
to keep it all going
when the world it was built for
is fading
with every day that passes 
will george and caroline
still be living that life 
  are we living it now 
  no  no 
our ancestors
lived different lives from us 
and our descendants
will live differently again 
but downton abbey
will be part of them 
won t be the same without you 
of course it will 
you ll take over
from where i left off 
you ll be
the frightening old lady
keeping everyone up to the mark 
thank you very much 
you will  my darling 
and you ll do it wonderfully 
you re the best of me
that will live on 
hurrah 
oh  granny  i love you so much 
no  shh 
but should you be here tonight 
won t you be worn out 
oh  mary  i can t spend
the rest of my life
in a shower of
 how are you feeling  
and  are you quite well  
oh  no 
the point is   
i ll be fine until i m not 
that s all there is to it 
ah  there you are 
  the dancing s starting 
  ah 
you mustn t miss it 
no  thank you 
thank you 
you know  you ll always be
with us  granny 
staring from every picture 
talking from every book 
as long as the house stands 
sounds very exhausting 
do you know  i think   
i should prefer
to rest in peace 
come on 
darling 
what is it you want 
we have things in common 
the boys  horses  racing 
and there must be more
if we look for it 
i want us to be friends 
well  we ll have to see 
no  dear 
we ll have to change 
both of us 
how did that happen 
was it you  mama 
how did you do it 
simple 
bertie asked the king 
i asked the queen 
i do love our adventures 
but isn t it fun
when they re over 
what are you doing here 
i wanted to see the dancing 
so i thought i d pretend
i was bringing lady bagshaw
a handkerchief 
i can give it to her 
if you d like 
i wish you could dance with me 
i ve got a question for you 
hmm 
you d never want
to leave downton
and start up somewhere else 
would you 
and tell me truthfully 
what brought this on 
just tell me 
leave downton 
i think we re stuck with it 
aren t we 
yes 
yes  i believe we are 
we shouldn t come out this way 
oh  they won t mind 
not this once 
well  they ve gone 
and downton is still standing 
elsie  a hundred years from now 
downton will still be standing 
and the crawleys
