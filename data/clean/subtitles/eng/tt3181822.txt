come on 
welcome  everybody 
to the start of
a brand new year 
this year 
we are studying
homer s iliad
and its themes 
the first one we ll be studying
is the wrath of achilles 
mrs  peterson 
principal warren 
what a nice surprise 
good news 
i ve approved your request
for noah sandborn
to join your class 
 no man or woman born 
coward or brave 
 can shun his destiny  
i think it was achilles
who said that  right 
wait 
ed 
wait 
wait a second 
this is a class
for ap juniors 
noah sandborn
is a transfer senior  so   
i m confused 
your transfer request
said  yeah 
that he d be an asset
to the class 
this was your email 
that s right  thank you 
have a great year 
hey 
stop following me 
i m not following you  claire 
i live next door 
kevin 
yeah 
did you send an email
from my account
to principal warren 
no  why 
because somebody did 
it sounds like
you ve been hacked 
you should really
change your password 
you know  i d be happy to help
you outwith that  if you want 
no  thanks 
hey  you ready to go 
yeah 
kevin 
noah  can you give us
a second  please 
you can wait
for him outside 
yeah  i ll be

mom  that was really rude 
why d you do that 
he s here way too much 
you re the one who
told him he could be
and he s coming
to dinner tonight 
no  your dad s
coming to dinner tonight 
so  why can t
he come  too 
i want it to just be
the three of us  okay 
okay  yeah 
okay 
all right 
i ll see you later  then 
my uncle bob was
a tail gunner in korea 
and a sergeant in vietnam 
tough old dude 
now he s laying
in valley memorial 
hoping the transplant takes 
here  you got that 
thanks 
your dad seems to be
around a lot now  huh 
yeah  i guess 
like a dinner
and a camping trip
can just make you forget about
how he walked out on you 
yeah  it s so predictable 
a guy hits middle age 
and suddenly
staring death in the face 
you know 
tire around the waist 
hair in the drain 
cock that just
won t stand up anymore 
he wants to
feel alive again 
he wants to
feel that rush 
you know  he felt
when he was our age 
so  he picks up
a younger woman and poof 
whole new life 
go ahead and aim 
almost 
little better  right 
yeah  here 
switch with me real quick 
then the guilt sets in 
because he basically just left
the first kid in the dust 
so  he tries to bribe him 
with things 
like computers 
wow 
you follow me 
so  what s up 
how s school 
it is what it is 
tell him about
your computer class 
he s learning how to
write his own software 
like father  like son 
that s cool  we can
do some stuff together 
i dropped it 
what 
i dropped it 
it was boring 
going out for boxing now 
you re going out for boxing

how would you know 
how would you know 
seriously  how would you know what
i like and what i don t like 
am i missing something here

oh  i m sure he does 
if we re not having

we  re having dinner

oh 
i m going crazy 
you guys have to spend the
night with me  out here  okay 
oh  god 
i love you very much 
i ll talk to you later 
ethan  uh  said you wanted to
take a look at the sandborn case 
yes 
sad  i remember it 
they were on a back road
outside san bernardino 
tire marks indicated the driver
had lost control of the car 
the crash killed both
passengers instantly 
and it was ruled
an accident 
bodies were destroyed 
so there was no toxicology 
but we assumed
the driver was drunk 
why was that 
well  he had
a long history of dul s 
or his brakes went out  i mean 
they could have been tampered with 
well  mrs  peterson 
even if his brakes went out 
there was no indication
of malfeasance 
sometimes 
breaks malfunction 
sometimes  people drive
while intoxicated 
this is the sandborn car 
if you don t need
anything else   
one more question 
detective  um   
was this a 2006 minivan 
well  yeah 
that s exactly what it is 
is there something else i
need to know  mrs  peterson 
no 
thank you 
hey  noah 
are you home 
yeah  what s up 
you got plans tonight 
well  i m supposed to go
to that car show with my dad 
well  i m over here
working on vicky s tractor 
you re at vicky s 
yeah  i m at her ranch

just get over here 
okay  catch you later  bye 
let me just start off
by saying i m sorry 
no  really  lam very 
very sorry 
vice principal lansing 
see 
i ve got a bit of a temper 
there s no denying that
and sometimes 
it gets the best of me 
like  when i feel
like i m being bullied 
and no one likes
to be bullied  vicky 
can i call you vicky 
i mean  given that
i m in your house 
and it s after hours 
calling you vice principal
just feels 
i don t know  wrong

is that  uh  you don t
like to be bullied 
i mean  who would 
but that s what you were
doing to me today 
you and claire 
now  the two of you 
with your little secrets 
you were playing a joke 
a silly little game 
trying to make me think
that you were her 
so she could do what 
something sneaky 
something   
she s hiding from me 
what was it  vicky 
no  no  no 
let me 
vicky 
listen  lam pretty sure
that noah tampered with the
brakes on his parents  car
and that s why they crashed 
and i m pretty sure he did
the same thing to garrett s 
claire  i need you 
i need to talk 
can you come over 
vicky  are you upstairs
