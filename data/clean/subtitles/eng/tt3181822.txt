a tail gunner in korea
and a sergeant in vietnam
tough old dude
now hes laying
in valley memorial
hoping the transplant takes
here you got that
thanks
your dad seems to be
around a lot now huh
yeah i guess
like a dinner
and a camping trip
can just make you forget about
how he walked out on you
yeah its so predictable
a guy hits middle age
and suddenly
staring death in the face
you know
tire around the waist
hair in the drain
cock that just
wont stand up anymore
he wants to
feel alive again
he wants to
feel that rush
you know he felt
when he was our age
so he picks up
a younger woman and poof
whole new life
go ahead and aim
almost
little better right
yeah here
switch with me real quick
then the guilt sets in
because he basically just left
the first kid in the dust
so he tries to bribe him
with things
like computers
wow

so whats up
hows school
it is what it is
tell him about
your computer class

write his own software

you guys have to spend the
night with me out here okay
oh god
i love you very much
ill talk to you later
ethan uh said you wanted to
take a look at the sandborn case
yes
sad i remember it
they were on a back road
outside san bernardino
tire marks indicated the driver
had lost control of the car
the crash killed both
passengers instantly
and it was ruled
an accident
bodies were destroyed
so there was no toxicology
but we assumed
the driver was drunk
why was that
well he had
a long history of duls
or his brakes went out i mean
they could have been tampered with
well mrs peterson
even if his brakes went out
there was no indication
of malfeasance
sometimes
breaks malfunction
sometimes people drive
while intoxicated
this is the sandborn car
if you dont need
anything else
one more question
detective um
was this a 2006 minivan
well yeah
thats exactly what it is
is there something else i
need to know mrs peterson
no

that noah tampered with the
brakes on his parents car
