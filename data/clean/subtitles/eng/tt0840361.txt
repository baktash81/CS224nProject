l never heard a man cry before 
l came downstairs in my underwear

first thing l remember was the ashtray 
must have been a hundred cigarettes
in there 
ash like a little mountain 
he stopped crying   
   was just sitting there watching tv
on a little black and white 
no sound 
l think he just didn t know
what else to do 
he looked at me standing there
in the doorway in my underoos 
he said    your mother left 
she s not coming back   
just like that 
smoking cigarettes and eating
a tv dinner at 6 in the morning 
we lost our dog the year before   
   and l wanted to make these posters   
   in case my mother was lost   
   someone could call us   
   like the guy who found our dog 
to this day my father will tell you he helped
me make them posters  but he didn t 
sat in the kitchen  drank a case of beer
while l went out on school street   
   asking people
if they d seen my mother 
her name was doris 
my grandmother had a place
that s a restaurant in tangerine  florida 
so l used to imagine
maybe that s where she went 
then l came to terms with the fact
that doesn t really matter  you know 
wherever she went 
she had a good reason to leave here 
she didn t wanna be
my mother anymore   
   and she wasn t coming back

local crime fighter 
what s happening  dino 
l know your father 
yeah  me too

yeah  one or two 
l hear they got to the old guy 
split him up the back 
fucking animals 
you d think they d go after
a younger kid 
l don t know 
making a statement  l guess 
townie crews ain t
what they used to be 
dorchester   
   southie   
   looking to make a move 
maybe you can change all that
when you get up there 
let me ask you a question 
what do you call a guy   
   who grows up with a group of people 
gets to know their secrets   
   because they trust him 
and then turns around   
   and use those secrets against them 
put those people in prison 
you d call him a rat  right 
you know what l call him 
dino the dago 
those people made you
a part of that community 
what did they get for it 
lnside of the fucking can 
you know we lifted a print
off the van  right 
special agent frawley   
   douglas macray 
frawley 
you and your boys didn t just   
 in townie accent     roll a star market
over in malden for a box of quarters 
 in normal voice 
no  you decided to bang it out   
   in the north end at 9 00 in the morning 
with assault rifles 
you fucking dummies shot a guard 
now you re like a half off sale
at big and tall  every cop is in line 
fortunately  though  for you   
   this guard 
who is two thirds to a retard   
   has miraculously clung to life 
now  if it were up to me   
   and they gave me two minutes
and a wet towel   
   l would personally asphyxiate
this half wit   
   so we could string you up
on a federal m1   
   and end this story
with a bag on your head   
   and a paralyzing agent
running through your veins 
this isn t fucking townie hopscotch
anymore  doug 
but l did want to say one thing 
you re here today
so l could personally tell you   
   that you are going to die
in federal prison 
and so are all your friends 
no deal 
no compromise 
and when that day comes   
   when you start trying to be
my hero collaborator so hard   
   that l have to slap you to shut up
and it will come   
   despite your pitiable 
misguided  irish omerta 
 when your code of silence
finally gives way   
   to fear of trafficking in cigarettes
to prevent sexual enslavement   
   l just want you to know that it s gonna
be me who tells you to go fuck yourself 
hey  next time you guys
wanna take pictures of me  just call ahead 
you know  we can do better
than a barbeque 
a calendar shoot  you know 
maybe topless  lubed up 
whatever you guys are into 
fbi car antennas
are half inch matte black   
   about three quarters the way down
the rear windshield 
statie are pigtailed   
   b p d   half and half 
every peewee in the town knows
what an fbi rear antenna looks like 
so  in the future  if you guys
are gonna try to be slick   
   be slicker than a 6 year old 
l gotta get back to work 
can l go
