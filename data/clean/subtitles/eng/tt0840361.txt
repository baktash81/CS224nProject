must have been a hundred cigarettes
in there
ash like a little mountain
he stopped crying

what else to do
he looked at me standing there
in the doorway in my underoos
he said your mother left
shes not coming back

smoking cigarettes and eating
a tv dinner at 6 in the morning
we lost our dog the year before
and l wanted to make these posters

sat in the kitchen drank a case of beer
while l went out on school street
asking people
if theyd seen my mother
her name was doris
my grandmother had a place
thats a restaurant in tangerine florida
so l used to imagine
maybe thats where she went
then l came to terms with the fact
that doesnt really matter you know
wherever she went
she had a good reason to leave here
she didnt wanna be
my mother anymore

a younger kid
l dont know
making a statement l guess
townie crews aint
what they used to be
dorchester
southie
looking to make a move
maybe you can change all that
when you get up there
let me ask you a question
what do you call a guy
who grows up with a group of people
gets to know their secrets
because they trust him
and then turns around
and use those secrets against them
put those people in prison
youd call him a rat right
you know what l call him
dino the dago
those people made you
a part of that community
what did they get for it
lnside of the fucking can
you know we lifted a print
off the van right
special agent frawley
douglas macray
frawley
you and your boys didnt just
in townie accent roll a star market
over in malden for a box of quarters
in normal voice
no you decided to bang it out
in the north end at 900 in the morning
with assault rifles
you fucking dummies shot a guard
now youre like a halfoff sale
at big and tall every cop is in line
fortunately though for you
this guard
who is twothirds to a retard
has miraculously clung to life
now if it were up to me
and they gave me two minutes
and a wet towel
l would personally asphyxiate
this halfwit
so we could string you up
on a federal m1
and end this story
with a bag on your head
and a paralyzing agent
running through your veins
this isnt fucking townie hopscotch
anymore doug
but l did want to say one thing
youre here today
so l could personally tell you
that you are going to die
in federal prison
and so are all your friends
no deal
no compromise
and when that day comes
when you start trying to be
my hero collaborator so hard
that l have to slap you to shut up
and it will come
despite your pitiable
misguided irish omerta
when your code of silence
finally gives way
to fear of trafficking in cigarettes
to prevent sexual enslavement
l just want you to know that its gonna
be me who tells you to go fuck yourself
hey next time you guys
wanna take pictures of me just call ahead
you know we can do better
than a barbeque
a calendar shoot you know
maybe topless lubed up
whatever you guys are into
fbi car antennas
are halfinch matte black
about threequarters the way down
the rear windshield
statie are pigtailed
bpd half and half
every peewee in the town knows
what an fbi rear antenna looks like
so in the future if you guys
are gonna try to be slick
be slicker than a 6yearold
