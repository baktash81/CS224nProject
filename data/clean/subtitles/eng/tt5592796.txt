move back 
you re surrounded 
fellows 
when answering
your questions 
we ve made a statement and
you should need to be satisfied
with that 
we all know
of course that this case
has had a great deal
of publicity 
the lawyers involved
in this case   
not a word 
you should bear in mind
that much of what you see
and read is propaganda
from the prosecution 
it s not a fair appraisal
of what in fact occurred 
some of it is
downright false 
stay focused 
stay calm 
stay honest 
look them in the eye 
be polite 
be respectful 
listen to the questions 
think about your answers 
take your time 
but not too much time 
give the detail   
not too much detail 
they ll confuse 
don t stare at the jury 
don t joke with the jury 
don t flirt with the jury

and that s all well and good 
but i   
you know i wanted
to get serious for a minute 
in the america i grew up in 
a man was defined
by the work he did 
but there was precious
little work to be had 
very few opportunities 
but that didn t stop me
from dreaming 
my father 
oh  he knew hard times 
but he was a smart man 
he said   it s okay to dream
as long as you combine
those dreams
with hard work  
when i was 14 
he bought this battered down 
old chevy
and took it apart
into 500 pieces
on our front lawn 
he said   son 
if you can put that car
back together  then it s yours  
and that s exactly what i did 
three days and nights
it took me 
i didn t eat or sleep 
but i did it 
and when it was done   
that car drove like a dream 
and that is my intention
with the delorean motorcar 
to build a dream car 
something the great american
public can aspire to owning 
ladies and gentlemen  it is my
great pleasure to present to you
the latest design
for the delorean motor car

my  you know  my percentage 
look  man  morgan finds out
what i m doing  i m a dead man 
it s only fair
that i m  you know  entitled to
a little piece of whatever
you recoup from him  right 
you know what  just maybe
a little tiny piece 
you know  something like  um   
well  i don t know what s fair 
ten percent  ten percent 
  hm  alright 
  a little  yeah  just a sliver 
  entitled 
  yeah  yeah 
well  you see it s pretty
simple  jim 
we have a way of working
these things out 
you get ten percent
of suck my fucking dick 
you re already
a paid government informant 
  am i  barely i would say  i  
  jim 
  what 
  must i remind you 
i m the only thing
standing between you and prison 
your job is to hook
morgan hetrick 
is he hooked 
isn t that why i m here 
 cause the last i checked 
he was in the cayman islands
countin  his fuckin  money 
i told you it was gonna take   
it s gonna take a little time
for me to earn back his trust 
i think you ve been
spending so much time
partying with john delorean 
you forgot
what you re supposed
to be doing here 
i need less champagne   
  more cocaine 
  that s clever  you know 
and if you ve got some sort of
misplaced loyalty
to morgan or you think
you re protecting your family
by fucking this shit up 
you re sadly fuckin  mistaken 
the next time you call me 
it better be
for a good fuckin  reason 
ten fuckin  percent 
the fbi will never ever
pay you ten percent 
you owe us  we don t owe you 
your next check
is gonna be short a 126 bucks 
because that s how much
those wires cost 
hey 
i could probably get you a
better deal on those  you know 
hey  that s a groovy little
camera you got 
  hello 
  betamax  man 
uh huh 
any money you re not putting
into delorean 
put it into betamax 
what money 
i don t know
why she bothers with him 
you know  he s chained
by a grandmaster 
really 
oh 
james hoffman 
what is that german 
yeah  i guess so 
you know  jim 
everything is out there 
it just takes a bit of leg work 
but that s what i do 
i gotta say 
most people are kinda straight 
but every once in a while 
you come up against someone
who s just 90   bullshit 
wants to hitch a ride 
the thing is  i haven t been
able to turn up
anything about you at all 
that worries me 
yeah  that worries me too 
actually 
oh 
  hey  ellen 
  yeah 
roy here thinks
i m 90   bullshit 
ninety 
james d jong 
or is it d yong 
  this is your birth name 
  mm hmm 
is your wife even aware
that you are james d jong 
i mean  i think so  i   i   
i actually don t know
if it s ever come up 
and what about mr  delorean 
was he aware of your real name 
your checkered history 
  i believe he was 
  you believe 
  you   you discussed it 
  no  but i alluded to it 
one of his executives
had me background checked 
background check on a man
who has no criminal history 
never spent a night in prison 
has only filed one
somewhat suspect tax return
in the last ten years 
what background was there
to check 
james d jong on the other
hand   
well  one can see why you might
wanna change your name 
hmm 
oh  don t worry about him 
he s just antsy because
we re stalled on the money 
what re you talkin  about 
i thought you guys were
signin   em up left and right 
not gonna raise 90 million
with penny antique
car dealerships 
gm thinks they ve created
a monster and it scares them 
if detroit is scared of you 
so is corporate america 
the fact is  i don t think
i ve got a chance in hell
of raising 90 million 
so take it somewhere else 
just like that  right 
i m being serious 
look  john   
roy digs deep enough
he s probably gonna find
something you re not gonna like 
truth is  i ve flown
all kinds of shit
all over the world 
bangkok  bolivia   
there re all types of people 
the one thing i ve learned is
that there is a deal to be made
everywhere  always 
right now we might be livin  in 
oh  sad cynical times 
but you re the goddamn
american dream  man 
people around the world
love that shit 
so i say  you know 
they don t love you here   
just  uh  take it
somewhere they will 
bring the american dream
to them 
it s an entire atlantic ocean
away from your primary market
and it s in the middle
of a fucking warzone 
do you know
how many people were killed
in northern ireland last year 
ninety 
do you know how many people
were murdered in detroit 
nine hundred 
do the fucking math 
you d be starting from scratch 
the last thing they built
was the titanic 
it s
john delorean s new sports car 
the dmc12 
thirty thousand a year 
the production target
for the northern ireland plant 
with the first cars
to go to dealers this fall 
oh  what s wrong 
is your little buddy
in a faraway land
and can t come out and play 
mm hmm 
it think it s cute how you
always gets sad
when he s out of town 
oh  come on 
the british
government spent
 120 million
for the plant 
for john delorean 
it s the realization of a dream
that started a long time ago 
so for 18 months 
while john delorean
was building his factory
providing jobs  helping bring
peace to a blighted country
you barely heard from 
no  you re not understanding
what i m saying  okay 
look  we ll    i will set up
the meeting  okay 
well  i was tryin  to get
morgan hetrick to part
with his money

you probably will 
see  she s smart 
look  are you gonna
call him or not 
i m on it  alright 
the dayglow bank 
for 18 months  that is
a    that is a very long time 
yeah  well  he had three
million reasons
not to trust me 
mr  hoffman  we ve heard of your
escapades in the drug business 
yet  no jail time 
we ve heard of your dealings
with nefarious criminals 
yet still alive
to tell the tale 
mr  hoffman  it must be said
you live a charmed life 
not sure my wife would agree
with you 
we never seem to really get
ahead of ourselves  you know 
  mm hmm 
  well  you ll get there 
now  just look at john

to sweet talk car dealers

john and cristina are pissed 
whole night was a fucking
nightmare 
the only good thing about it
is that you re back home 
oh  there s one other
good thing 
oh  that s right 
wait   
but where s the key 
what the hell s this 
it s a coupon for 25 percent off
a brand new delorean
at our nearest dealer 
  what the fuck 
  what did you think 
he was gonna give you
a brand new car 
yes  yeah 
i mean  come on 
the guy s got thousands of  em 
what    it s a lot better than
this shit 
mr  hoffman  did you expect
to benefit financially
from your association
with john delorean 
uh  no  sir 
you didn t repeatedly hint
that a free delorean car
might be in order 
  no  sir 
  why not 
you being such a important
consultant 
uh  well 
to tell you the truth 
it wasn t a very good car 
flattered to deceive 
uh  by the time
it came to market
everything original about it
had been striped away 
i mean  he just couldn t make
the car he wanted to
with the  with the money he had 
i   i   i actually felt
sorry for him at that point
 cause there he was schlepping
himself around the world
attempting to sell this 
this dream he didn t
even believe in any more 
well  that s quite an insight
for a man with no experience 
well  i know cars 
you know  john knows cars 
obviously  he   
boils down to the fact that
the car wasn t good enough 
  you know  just ask him 
  okay 
  mr  hoffman  i don t think  
  well  ask him 
eh  the car wasn t good enough 
was it  john 
am i right  uh  i mean 
that s the problem here 
  not all this other shit 
  mr  hoffman 
settle  settle down 
mr  hoffman 
the car is not on trial here 
and neither are you 
i know  i know  sorry 
  mr  weitzman 
  y   y   yes  your honor 
but we are getting
to the crux of the matter 
mr  hoffman 
if cars are clearly your thing
and the delorean was 
in your eyes 
such a disappointment 
is this perhaps reason enough
to betray your friend
and neighbor 
oh  john  just this once 
alright  it s okay 
yeah 
fuck 
john 
fuck  fuck  fuck 
no  don t you say anything 
if it comes from anyone 
it comes from me 
that bitch  that fucking bitch 
you were right 
what about belfast 
alright 
do that 
molly s gone
to the fucking papers 
  fuck 
  why would she 
i got to go
to belfast 
  now 
  mm hm 
i ll get your case 
yep  bill   
no  i m not gonna talk
to every fucking   
yeah  i ll take the  times  
patch  em through 
molly  i told you 
hey  john  anything i can do 
no  no 
  should we go 
  no 
  just finish the caviar  yeah 
  yeah 
yes  jeff  i absolutely refute
these allegations 
no company in the world has been
subjected to more scrutiny
from you gentlemen in the press 
from auditors  from accountants 
look  jeff

she s nothing more than
a glorified secretary 
and she wasn t even
up to that job 
can we go  please 
there are no such thing
as secret
swiss bank accounts 
molly gibson had absolutely
no access
to detailed financial records 
that is it 
she had access to everything 
fucking everything  fuck 
mr  hoffman  you are aware
that these allegations
of financial impropriety
were fully investigated
by the british government
and dismissed 
dismissed  absolutely 
ladies and gentlemen  the truth
is that while john delorean
was in the eye of the hurricane 
so to speak 
mr  hoffman s sole contribution
was that of a glorified
groundskeeper

i cleaned his pool as well 
doin  a good job

supplying our engines 
of the 8000 cars we ve built 
i ve sold maybe 3000 
i owe bank of america

john

  um hm 
delorean wants me to set him up

john delorean   
 30 million  cocaine 
if i put him and hetrick
together 
that d be a pretty sweet deal
for you  yeah 
wait  wait  wait 
john delorean 
why on earth would
john delorean  
who gives a shit 
hey  you want a big name
for president reagan 
you wanna stop drowning 
i can give you john delorean
on a silver fucking platter 
and i ll do it 
all i ask is that 
my family and i go free 
my record is expunged   
and i get ten percent
of whatever
morgan transfers to davrow 
what s wrong  special agent 
this kind of decision
outside your pay grade 
i got to make a call 
look  we never thought this
whole thing was gonna happen 
john was looking
for the funds legally but  uh 
you know  this whole drug thing
was a weird fantasy 
right 
but  you know  then  once
the fbi got involved 
they got very excited about it 
and that s when we decided
to bring davrow in 
ah  davrow 
yeah  let s talk about davrow 
there s nothin 
to understand 
it s a road trip  okay  the guy
is under a lot of pressure 
we re all under a lot of
pressure 
yeah  no  i know  okay  but his
has a few more decimal points 
okay  i m just introducing him
to a banker right now 
budget rental car s
talking about
taking a thousand cars 
they figure there are a lot of
people who don t necessarily
want to own a delorean 
but they would love
to experience driving one 
john 
  john 
  i just can t keep doing this 
they walk us up the aisle and
fuck us before we take our vows 
alright  i got this other
meeting to go to 
  are we set 
  all set 
  what other meeting 
  you re doin  a great job 
  keep it up 
  why with him 
why would you go to a meeting
with him 
hey  hey  hey 
you built it  you drive it 
   specialize in building
money in high risk 
high yield investments 
that just won t work  bill 
what 
when i get this money
i m going right back to   
going right back to that sketch 
i want that feeling back 
and how it felt
when you re driving down
the street
in the car you built yourself 
and you know your dad s
watching you
and you just   
swell up 
you know  john 
it s not too late to back out
of this thing  right 
because these guys  i mean   
they  um 
they re not good people 
and once they get their
hooks in you  it can really  
there are an awful lot of
families in northern ireland 
who need this 
men and women not afraid
to stand up and be counted 
and if they can do it   
goddamn right  i can as well 
nice to meet you 
james benedict 
um hm 
hi 
i can t believe i m here
with john delorean 
i saw you on tv 
  well  i m on tv a lot 
  i   
  coffee 
  black 
i m not sure that  uh 
tv is good for business 
i don t exactly relish
the spotlight 
well  the way i see it 
the darkest dark
is the dark besides the
spotlight 
you can do anything there
and no one seems to notice 
i like that 
the darkest dark   
so  uh  john  i  uh 
i like what i see of the  uh   
it s funny  they call it
the delorean
in front of john delorean 
but  uh  yeah  great things 
um  i love the wings 
they re futuristic 
maybe i ll get a car
out of this 
john 
i guess fate has dealt you
a dirty blow 
  well  i m still swinging 
  good for you 
  james benedict 
  morgan    hetrick 
  uh  coffee 
  nope 
so  john 
what s the story 
the story is  the british
government has written off
two hundred twenty eight
million dollars of our debt 
but they won t pay us
the 94 they still owe us 
and that is exactly why
i stay away from anything
to do with governments 
morgan  i think we can all agree
that this could be the start of
a very good relationship 
mutually beneficial 
shall we 
jim 
you re the point man on this 
do you wanna   
okay  well  we all know that
john is one of the finest
businessmen in   in   in 
on this planet  umm  
don t need a fucking
biography  jim  what s the deal 
uh  you know  i m not really
sure where to start  um   
the deal is  my company s worth
hundreds of millions of dollars 
anyone who s looked at our books
agrees on that 
but i ve hit a cash flow problem
and i need to plug the gap 
i have two million 
i need to turn it
into thirty million
within eight days 
or we lose control 
  jim 
  yeah 
so  uh  we need you to go down
to columbia
and pick up the merchandise 
i don t sell 
i don t distribute 
it s not my game 
yeah  we re not asking you
to do that 
we have someone for that 
who 
  i don t like  
  his name is john vicenza 
this is what he does 
he put a lot of money
through this bank 
a lot of money 
so everything goes smooth 
everybody gets their cut 
john gets to keep his company 
and  uh  we get an option
to invest  to diversify 
because if you do too much here 
it raises flags 
yeah  absolutely 
nature of our business 
we move money all over the world
without explaining it 
okay 
got to admit 
you make me nervous 
jim  jim  jim 
we have history 
what kind of history 
the wrong kind 
look  i don t want
any kind of thing structured
where jim here has a chance
to fuck around 
  okay 
  oh  boy 
i mean  what if jim
takes the monkeys 
jim says
i m going to my dealer 
jim comes back with
some bruises 
jim says someone
stole the monkeys 
that s not gonna happen  morgan 
first  jim s money is
tied up with me 
he knows if he does anything
funny  the money disappears 
and second  vicenza 
jim s head would be
on a platter 
and his wife s  and kids 
so  there s no worries
on that front 
you trust him 
as much as any man here 
alright  now 
if the brits make a move
and  um  and the cash
isn t in the bank 
maybe i need some sort
of promissory note
i can present to them 
would that be doable 
there s a lot of factors
involved  but  uh   
yeah  we can look at that
all things being even 
morgan 
i guess we got a deal 
well  that went pretty well 
morgan s a good pilot 
and he s careful 
and a contact for the monkeys 
  stop saying monkeys 
  morgan  he s  
yeah  morgan says it because
he s a piece of shit criminal 
alright 
he s allowed to say monkeys 
you re not allowed to say
monkeys  stop saying it 
you sound like a fucking idiot 
  hoffman residence 
  hey  i m not ready to go

i ve been down this road before
and i love jim 
i m never gonna leave him

then you need to have
a plan  cause you will be
dragged down with him 
  jim 
  ellen  it s bill 
i m looking for john 
do you have any idea
where he is or cristina or  
  has something happened 
  no  what do you mean 
  what could ve happened 
  no  nothing  sorry  bill 
  no  i don t know where  
  oh  let me talk to him 
give me the phone 
bill 
cristina  it s absolutely vital
that i speak to john
immediately 
we know he s in la
but we can t find him 
you know where he is 
thank you 
well  you re moments away
from being a very rich man 
okay  let me rephrase
the question 
who first raised the subject
of a possible drug deal 
it s hard to say 
it just kind of came up 
h   how did it just  come up  
well  one minute it wasn t there
and the next minute  it was 
  hurry up  come on 
  they re in the lobby 
heading upstairs 
let s get everything ready 
okay  got it 
hide that 
hide that  go 
mr  delorean  excuse me  sir 
is it  mr  delorean 
i have a call for you  sir 
i ll transfer the call to the
house phone  right over there 
so did he   he just call you
and   and   and say 
 hey  man  i need  30 million
to save my company 
let s do a drug deal  
what are we talking
about here  john 
that i need help 
it s just not cut
and dry like you want 
i   i   it really isn t 
that s v   very different
than suggesting
a   a   drug deal 
don t you think 
well  it is and it isn t 
he may have alluded to it 
you don t think
that thomas edison   
or ford or kennedy didn t cut
a few corners
every now and then
for the greater good 
is any of this alluding
to be found
in the many hours of fbi tapes
of your phone calls
with mr  delorean 
uh  no  this predates that 
john delorean 
john  we have a deal
to save the car  the factory   
  everything 
  bill 
minit financial came
through with a 100 million
but you need
to sign it now  today 
before the brits get wind of it
or there ll be no company
left to save 
  i have a deal here 
  no  you don t 
you have a life sentence 
you need to sign this 
  i can t do it  bill 
  why  for christ sake 
this is what we ve been breakin 
our asses for 
because they ll own the company 
at best 
i ll be a figure head
and most likely
they ll push me out 
you can t just throw it
all away like this 
so  basically 
what it all comes down to
is your word against his 
the word of a man
who even according to you
is one of the most respected
businessmen in the world 
and that of a drug smuggler
and government informant 
okay  we ve got
about 30 seconds 
come on 
you know
the biggest mistake we made 
making all the cars
the same color 
sure  they re futuristic
looking but   
should ve had a variety 
once we secure the company 
we re going to come out
with a whole range of colors
and it s going to be amazing 
are you okay  john 
sure 
you know  i never thanked you
properly  jim 
and i always meant to 
w    hey   
don t do this  john 
just go home to cristina 
work somethin  else out 
i ll go in here alone and just
call the whole thing off 
alright 
no  you re missing the point 
john delorean always leads
from the front 
that s why he s john delorean 
right 
everything s gonna be fine 
john  glad you could make it 
  this is john vicenza 
  hello  alright 
  heard a lot about you  john 
  hi 
kind of a different
world for you  huh 
well  you d be surprised 
i  uh  took the opportunity
of ordering some champagne 
well  it  it seems
like a day for champagne  huh 
now   
um  are the  uh 
are the  uh  monkeys here 
some 
uh  the rest are downstairs 
mm hm 
oh 
we got a quite a party here 
it s  uh   
go ahead  john 
pick it up 
well  that s better than gold 
gold weighs more than that 
for goodness sakes 
so  here s to  uh 
to a lot of success for everyone
and  uh  for all those 
those phone calls 
huh  jim 
thank you 
hi  john  jerry west 
i m with the fbi 
you re under arrest
for narcotic laws violation 
i  um  i don t understand 
i m going to advise you
of your rights 
you have the right
to remain silent 
anything you say can
and will be used against you
in a court of law 
you have the right
to an attorney 
if you can t afford one 
one will be provided 
do you understand your rights 
john z  delorean  former top
executive with general motors
more recently the creator
of a slick sports car
that bore his name 
today faced federal drug charges
in los angeles 
john delorean  the flamboyant
former gm executive
remains in custody tonight
on federal drug charges 
they found several
pounds of cocaine 
the fbi
would rather call it
an undercover investigation
but it was a semi classic
sting operation 
the fbi agent said delorean
had been under surveillance
for five months 
 24 million
cocaine deal 
the fbi says  he was the   
delorean claims
jim trapped him
in the drug deal  while fbi
agents posing as drug dealers
open a suitcase full of cocaine 
they could receive federal
prison terms of up to 15 years 
driven and finally desperate

mr  hoffman 
i   it s quite simple 
did john delorean suggest
the drug deal 
because if he did  then he is
a willing participant 
but if he didn t 
then he is the victim
of an outrageous fbi entrapment 
so  which is it 
did john delorean suggest
the drug deal 
well   
can you help me  jim 
well  it s hard to say 
settle 
settle down

entitled case

john z  delorean  not guilty
as charged in count one 
not guilty as charged
in count two 
not guilty as charged
in count three

in count four 
not guilty as charged
in count five
