move back
youre surrounded
fellows
when answering
your questions
weve made a statement and
you should need to be satisfied
with that
we all know
of course that this case
has had a great deal
of publicity
the lawyers involved
in this case
not a word
you should bear in mind
that much of what you see
and read is propaganda
from the prosecution
its not a fair appraisal
of what in fact occurred
some of it is
downright false
stay focused
stay calm
stay honest
look them in the eye
be polite
be respectful
listen to the questions
think about your answers
take your time
but not too much time
give the detail
not too much detail
theyll confuse

in the america i grew up in
a man was defined
by the work he did
but there was precious
little work to be had
very few opportunities
but that didnt stop me
from dreaming
my father
oh he knew hard times
but he was a smart man
he said its okay to dream
as long as you combine
those dreams
with hard work
when i was 14
he bought this battered down
old chevy
and took it apart
into 500 pieces
on our front lawn
he said son
if you can put that car
back together then its yours
and thats exactly what i did
three days and nights
it took me
i didnt eat or sleep
but i did it
and when it was done
that car drove like a dream
and that is my intention
with the delorean motorcar
to build a dream car

public can aspire to owning

jesus christ jim
okay okay
but hey at least
he and i are talking now
thats a good thing
i mean we discussed
the the uh money
in the caymans
and how to access it
but we only have your word
for it and thats worth shit
look from now on
every time you see that fucker
youre wearing a wire
absolutely
absolutely
wh which i you know
i could say brings me
to my second issue
you gotta be fuckin kidding me
hey look hey hold on okay
look i realize that
you and i we have never uh
we never discussed about my uh
you know my cut
your cut
yeah my cut
my you know my percentage
look man morgan finds out
what im doing im a dead man
its only fair
that im you know entitled to
a little piece of whatever
you recoup from him right
you know what just maybe
a little tiny piece
you know something like um
well i dont know whats fair
ten percent ten percent
hm alright
a little yeah just a sliver
entitled
yeah yeah
well you see its pretty
simple jim
we have a way of working
these things out
you get ten percent
of suck my fucking dick
youre already
a paid government informant
am i barely i would say i
jim
what
must i remind you
im the only thing
standing between you and prison
your job is to hook
morgan hetrick
is he hooked
isnt that why im here
cause the last i checked
he was in the cayman islands
countin his fuckin money
i told you it was gonna take
its gonna take a little time
for me to earn back his trust
i think youve been
spending so much time
partying with john delorean
you forgot
what youre supposed
to be doing here
i need less champagne
more cocaine
thats clever you know
and if youve got some sort of
misplaced loyalty
to morgan or you think
youre protecting your family
by fucking this shit up
youre sadly fuckin mistaken
the next time you call me
it better be
for a good fuckin reason
ten fuckin percent
the fbi will never ever
pay you ten percent
you owe us we dont owe you
your next check
is gonna be short a 126 bucks
because thats how much
those wires cost
hey
i could probably get you a
better deal on those you know
hey thats a groovy little
camera you got
hello
betamax man
uhhuh
any money youre not putting
into delorean
put it into betamax
what money
i dont know
why she bothers with him
you know hes chained
by a grandmaster
really
oh
james hoffman
what is that german
yeah i guess so
you know jim
everything is out there
it just takes a bit of leg work
but thats what i do
i gotta say
most people are kinda straight
but every once in a while
you come up against someone
whos just 90  bullshit
wants to hitch a ride
the thing is i havent been
able to turn up
anything about you at all
that worries me
yeah that worries me too
actually
oh
hey ellen
yeah
roy here thinks
im 90  bullshit
ninety
james djong
or is it dyong
this is your birth name
mmhmm
is your wife even aware
that you are james djong
i mean i think so i i
i actually dont know
if its ever come up
and what about mr delorean
was he aware of your real name
your checkered history
i believe he was
you believe
you you discussed it
no but i alluded to it
one of his executives
had me background checked
background check on a man
who has no criminal history
never spent a night in prison
has only filed one
somewhat suspect tax return
in the last ten years
what background was there
to check
james djong on the other
hand
well one can see why you might
wanna change your name
hmm
oh dont worry about him
hes just antsy because
were stalled on the money
whatre you talkin about
i thought you guys were
signin em up left and right
not gonna raise 90 million
with penny antique
car dealerships
gm thinks theyve created
a monster and it scares them
if detroit is scared of you
so is corporate america
the fact is i dont think
ive got a chance in hell
of raising 90 million
so take it somewhere else
just like that right
im being serious
look john
roy digs deep enough
hes probably gonna find
something youre not gonna like
truth is ive flown
all kinds of shit
all over the world
bangkok bolivia
therere all types of people
the one thing ive learned is
that there is a deal to be made
everywhere always
right now we might be livin in
oh sad cynical times
but youre the goddamn
american dream man
people around the world
love that shit
so i say you know
they dont love you here
just uh take it
somewhere they will
bring the american dream
to them
its an entire atlantic ocean
away from your primary market
and its in the middle
of a fucking warzone
do you know
how many people were killed
in northern ireland last year
ninety
do you know how many people
were murdered in detroit
nine hundred
do the fucking math
youd be starting from scratch
the last thing they built
was the titanic
its
john deloreans new sports car
the dmc12
thirty thousand a year
the production target
for the northern ireland plant
with the first cars
to go to dealers this fall
oh whats wrong
is your little buddy
in a faraway land
and cant come out and play
mmhmm
it think its cute how you
always gets sad
when hes out of town
oh come on
the british
government spent
120 million
for the plant
for john delorean
its the realization of a dream
that started a long time ago
so for 18 months
while john delorean
was building his factory
providing jobs helping bring
peace to a blighted country
you barely heard from
no youre not understanding
what im saying okay
look well i will set up
the meeting okay
well i was tryin to get
morgan hetrick to part
with his money
if we set up a meeting
you probably will
see shes smart
look are you gonna
call him or not
im on it alright
the dayglow bank
for 18 months that is
a that is a very long time
yeah well he had three
million reasons
not to trust me
mr hoffman weve heard of your
escapades in the drug business
yet no jail time
weve heard of your dealings
with nefarious criminals
yet still alive
to tell the tale
mr hoffman it must be said
you live a charmed life
not sure my wife would agree
with you
we never seem to really get
ahead of ourselves you know
mmhmm
well youll get there
now just look at john
one minute
hes tryin
to sweet talk car dealers
the next hes got
this office on park avenue

oh thats right
wait
but wheres the key
what the hells this
its a coupon for 25 percent off
a brand new delorean
at our nearest dealer
what the fuck
what did you think
he was gonna give you
a brand new car
yes yeah
i mean come on
the guys got thousands of em
what its a lot better than
this shit
mr hoffman did you expect
to benefit financially
from your association
with john delorean
uh no sir
you didnt repeatedly hint
that a free delorean car
might be in order
no sir
why not
you being such a important
consultant
uh well
to tell you the truth
it wasnt a very good car
flattered to deceive
uh by the time
it came to market
everything original about it
had been striped away
i mean he just couldnt make
the car he wanted to
with the with the money he had
i i i actually felt
sorry for him at that point
cause there he was schlepping
himself around the world
attempting to sell this
this dream he didnt
even believe in any more
well thats quite an insight
for a man with no experience
well i know cars
you know john knows cars
obviously he
boils down to the fact that
the car wasnt good enough
you know just ask him
okay
mr hoffman i dont think
well ask him
eh the car wasnt good enough
was it john
am i right uh i mean
thats the problem here
not all this other shit
mr hoffman
settle settle down
mr hoffman
the car is not on trial here
and neither are you
i know i know sorry
mr weitzman
y y yes your honor
but we are getting
to the crux of the matter
mr hoffman
if cars are clearly your thing
and the delorean was
in your eyes
such a disappointment
is this perhaps reason enough
to betray your friend
and neighbor
oh john just this once
alright its okay
yeah
fuck
john
fuck fuck fuck
no dont you say anything
if it comes from anyone
it comes from me
that bitch that fucking bitch
you were right
what about belfast
alright
do that
mollys gone
to the fucking papers
fuck
why would she
i got to go
to belfast
now
mmhm
ill get your case
yep bill
no im not gonna talk
to every fucking
yeah ill take the times
patch em through
molly i told you
hey john anything i can do
no no
should we go
no
just finish the caviar yeah
yeah
yes jeff i absolutely refute
these allegations
no company in the world has been
subjected to more scrutiny
from you gentlemen in the press
from auditors from accountants
look jeff
off the record
okay on the record
shes nothing more than
a glorified secretary
and she wasnt even
up to that job
can we go please
there are no such thing
as secret
swiss bank accounts
molly gibson had absolutely
no access
to detailed financial records
that is it
she had access to everything
fucking everything fuck
mr hoffman you are aware
that these allegations
of financial impropriety
were fully investigated
by the british government
and dismissed
dismissed absolutely
ladies and gentlemen the truth
is that while john delorean
was in the eye of the hurricane
so to speak
mr hoffmans sole contribution
was that of a glorified
groundskeeper
that is not true
i cleaned his pool as well
doin a good job
down there
hey
whats up john
i didnt know you were back
got in last night
you want a beer
sure
there was a moment there
when it was absolutely perfect
i dont have the cash
to make payroll
renault is going to stop
supplying our engines
of the 8000 cars weve built
ive sold maybe 3000
i owe bank of america
20 million
and they own every car
on this side of the atlantic
all of their loans
are being called in
that facility is cancelled
well i mean you know
things could get worse
its over buddy
wait a minute
thats not no uhuh
no no no no
i i i dont believe that
not for a second
eh look
youre youre gonna
think of something
youll work it out
you always do you know
you know what this is a lot
like that that
the car that your
dad bought you
no it is
y y you got the whole thing
laid out in front of you
in a million pieces
and and what did you do in
that situation
you put that thing back
together
you know better than new
because thats
i mean thats who you are
i appreciate your optimism jim
but its no good
no no no
th th this is not optimism
thats not whats goin on here
this is fact
you are a remarkable guy
youre a force of nature
you are
me im full of shit
alright

so theres charm in that
you know i think
i hope right
but no really you
you actually get stuff done
why dont you help me
absolutely whatever you need
i need to raise 30 million
in the next ten days
and theres no bank
no hedge fund
no investor whos going to
lend it to me
but you know people
i
now i have a good business
i can make people very wealthy
its a cash flow problem
alright
i need to raise
30 million
and you know people
bolivia thailand
all the rest of it
you know people
what are we talking about here
john
that i need your help
i need this jim
there are 2000 workers
in belfast that need this
you know the joke is
i could walk away now
and still be a very rich man
but i cant do that
im not that guy
can you help me jim
youre early
umhm
delorean wants me to set him up
with 30 million
worth of cocaine
what
john delorean
30 million cocaine
if i put him and hetrick
together
thatd be a pretty sweet deal
for you yeah
wait wait wait
john delorean
why on earth would
john delorean
who gives a shit
hey you want a big name
for president reagan
you wanna stop drowning
i can give you john delorean
on a silver fucking platter
and ill do it
all i ask is that
my family and i go free
my record is expunged
and i get ten percent
of whatever
morgan transfers to davrow
whats wrong special agent
this kind of decision
outside your pay grade
i got to make a call
look we never thought this
whole thing was gonna happen
john was looking
for the funds legally but uh
you know this whole drug thing
was a weird fantasy
right
but you know then once
the fbi got involved
they got very excited about it
and thats when we decided
to bring davrow in
ah davrow
yeah lets talk about davrow
theres nothin
to understand
its a road trip okay the guy
is under a lot of pressure
were all under a lot of
pressure
yeah no i know okay but his
has a few more decimal points
okay im just introducing him
to a banker right now
budget rental cars
talking about
taking a thousand cars
they figure there are a lot of
people who dont necessarily
want to own a delorean
but they would love
to experience driving one
john
john
i just cant keep doing this
they walk us up the aisle and
fuck us before we take our vows
alright i got this other
meeting to go to
are we set
all set
what other meeting
youre doin a great job
keep it up
why with him
why would you go to a meeting
with him
hey hey hey
you built it you drive it
specialize in building
money in high risk
high yield investments
that just wont work bill
what
when i get this money
im going right back to
going right back to that sketch
i want that feeling back
and how it felt
when youre driving down
the street
in the car you built yourself
and you know your dads
watching you
and you just
swell up
you know john
its not too late to back out
of this thing right
because these guys i mean
they um
theyre not good people
and once they get their
hooks in you it can really
there are an awful lot of
families in northern ireland
who need this
men and women not afraid
to stand up and be counted
and if they can do it
goddamn right i can as well
nice to meet you
james benedict
umhm
hi
i cant believe im here
with john delorean
i saw you on tv
well im on tv a lot
i
coffee
black
im not sure that uh
tv is good for business
i dont exactly relish
the spotlight
well the way i see it
the darkest dark
is the dark besides the
spotlight
you can do anything there
and no one seems to notice
i like that
the darkest dark
so uh john i uh
i like what i see of the uh
its funny they call it
the delorean
in front of john delorean
but uh yeah great things
um i love the wings
theyre futuristic
maybe ill get a car
out of this
john
i guess fate has dealt you
a dirty blow
well im still swinging
good for you
james benedict
morgan hetrick
uh coffee
nope
so john
whats the story
the story is the british
government has written off
two hundred twenty eight
million dollars of our debt
but they wont pay us
the 94 they still owe us
and that is exactly why
i stay away from anything
to do with governments
morgan i think we can all agree
that this could be the start of
a very good relationship
mutually beneficial
shall we
jim
youre the point man on this
do you wanna
okay well we all know that
john is one of the finest
businessmen in in in
on this planet umm
dont need a fucking
biography jim whats the deal
uh you know im not really
sure where to start um
the deal is my companys worth
hundreds of millions of dollars
anyone whos looked at our books
agrees on that
but ive hit a cash flow problem
and i need to plug the gap
i have two million
i need to turn it
into thirty million
within eight days
or we lose control
jim
yeah
so uh we need you to go down
to columbia
and pick up the merchandise
i dont sell
i dont distribute
its not my game
yeah were not asking you
to do that
we have someone for that
who
i dont like
his name is john vicenza
this is what he does
he put a lot of money
through this bank
a lot of money
so everything goes smooth
everybody gets their cut
john gets to keep his company
and uh we get an option
to invest to diversify
because if you do too much here
it raises flags
yeah absolutely
nature of our business
we move money all over the world
without explaining it
okay
got to admit
you make me nervous
jim jim jim
we have history
what kind of history
the wrong kind
look i dont want
any kind of thing structured
where jim here has a chance
to fuck around
okay
oh boy
i mean what if jim
takes the monkeys
jim says
im going to my dealer
jim comes back with
some bruises
jim says someone
stole the monkeys
thats not gonna happen morgan
first jims money is
tied up with me
he knows if he does anything
funny the money disappears
and second vicenza
jims head would be
on a platter
and his wifes and kids
so theres no worries
on that front
you trust him
as much as any man here
alright now
if the brits make a move
and um and the cash
isnt in the bank
maybe i need some sort
of promissory note
i can present to them
would that be doable
theres a lot of factors
involved but uh
yeah we can look at that
all things being even
morgan
i guess we got a deal
well that went pretty well
morgans a good pilot
and hes careful
and a contact for the monkeys
stop saying monkeys
morgan hes
yeah morgan says it because
hes a piece of shit criminal
alright
hes allowed to say monkeys
youre not allowed to say
monkeys stop saying it

jim

has something happened

what couldve happened
no nothing sorry bill
no i dont know where
oh let me talk to him
give me the phone
bill
cristina its absolutely vital
that i speak to john
immediately
we know hes in la
but we cant find him
you know where he is
thank you
well youre moments away
from being a very rich man
okay let me rephrase
the question
who first raised the subject
of a possible drug deal
its hard to say
it just kind of came up
h how did it just come up
well one minute it wasnt there
and the next minute it was
hurry up come on
theyre in the lobby
heading upstairs
lets get everything ready
okay got it
hide that
hide that go
mr delorean excuse me sir
is it mr delorean
i have a call for you sir
ill transfer the call to the
house phone right over there
so did he he just call you
and and and say
hey man i need 30 million
to save my company
lets do a drug deal
what are we talking
about here john
that i need help
its just not cut
and dry like you want
i i it really isnt
thats v very different
than suggesting
a a drug deal
dont you think
well it is and it isnt
he may have alluded to it
you dont think
that thomas edison
or ford or kennedy didnt cut
a few corners
every now and then
for the greater good
is any of this alluding
to be found
in the many hours of fbi tapes
of your phone calls
with mr delorean
uh no this predates that
john delorean
john we have a deal
to save the car the factory
everything
bill
minit financial came
through with a 100 million
but you need
to sign it now today
before the brits get wind of it
or therell be no company
left to save
i have a deal here
no you dont
you have a life sentence
you need to sign this
i cant do it bill
why for christ sake
this is what weve been breakin
our asses for
because theyll own the company
at best
ill be a figure head
and most likely
theyll push me out
you cant just throw it
all away like this
so basically
what it all comes down to
is your word against his
the word of a man
who even according to you
is one of the most respected
businessmen in the world
and that of a drug smuggler
and government informant
okay weve got
about 30 seconds
come on
you know
the biggest mistake we made
making all the cars
the same color
sure theyre futuristic
looking but
shouldve had a variety
once we secure the company
were going to come out
with a whole range of colors
and its going to be amazing
are you okay john
sure
you know i never thanked you
properly jim
and i always meant to
w hey
dont do this john
just go home to cristina
work somethin else out
ill go in here alone and just
call the whole thing off
alright
no youre missing the point
john delorean always leads
from the front
thats why hes john delorean
right
everythings gonna be fine
john glad you could make it
this is john vicenza
hello alright
heard a lot about you john
hi
kind of a different
world for you huh
well youd be surprised
i uh took the opportunity
of ordering some champagne
well it it seems
like a day for champagne huh
now
um are the uh
are the uh monkeys here
some
uh the rest are downstairs
mmhm
oh
we got a quite a party here
its uh
go ahead john
pick it up
well thats better than gold
gold weighs more than that
for goodness sakes
so heres to uh
to a lot of success for everyone
and uh for all those
those phone calls

and will be used against you
in a court of law
you have the right
to an attorney
if you cant afford one

john z delorean former top
executive with general motors
more recently the creator
of a slick sports car
that bore his name
today faced federal drug charges
in los angeles
john delorean the flamboyant
former gm executive
remains in custody tonight
on federal drug charges
they found several
pounds of cocaine
the fbi
would rather call it
an undercover investigation
but it was a semiclassic
sting operation
the fbi agent said delorean
had been under surveillance
for five months
24 million
cocaine deal
the fbi says he was the
delorean claims
jim trapped him
in the drug deal while fbi
agents posing as drug dealers
open a suitcase full of cocaine
they could receive federal
prison terms of up to 15 years
driven and finally desperate
for success
delorean himself is
out of jail on bail
in california we have more
on that from dennis murphy
last night wearing
the same suit he was arrested in
eleven days before
john delorean walked
from federal prison
and embraced his wife
his travel
is restricted to parts
of california and new york
delorean s next court
appearance is in a week
you fell for it
fell for what
jesus john what are you doing
id be within my rights
to shoot you dead
john dont be an idiot okay
its only gonna
make things worse just stop
its not really my style
how are you jim
im okay
you
hows cristina
well shes hired a designer
to make her a new outfit
for everyday of the trial
thats gonna be
a long trial so
thats what we in the automobile
industry
call an exit strategy

john im sorry about
no
dont
you saw an opportunity
and you took it
i trust you were amply rewarded
no
boy they always find a way
to fuck us dont they
yeah
stay focused
stay calm
stay honest
look them in the eye
be polite and respect
mr hoffman
i its quite simple
did john delorean suggest
the drug deal
because if he did then he is
a willing participant
but if he didnt
then he is the victim
of an outrageous fbi entrapment
so which is it
did john delorean suggest
the drug deal
well
can you help me jim
well its hard to say
settle
settle down
the united states of america
versus john z delorean

entitled case
find the defendant
john z delorean not guilty
as charged in count one
not guilty as charged
in count two
not guilty as charged
in count three
not guilty as charged
in count four
not guilty as charged
in count five
not guilty as charged
in count six
mr delorean

to resume your career
in the auto industry

a used car from me
all you had to say was
it was his idea
thats all you had to do
well you and your family

protection is sending you
