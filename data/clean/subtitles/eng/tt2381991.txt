an ofttold tale
that of snow white
how she vanquished the evil queen ravenna
and took her rightful place on the throne
but there is another story
one you have not yet seen
one that comes long before
happily ever after
a mere pawn
a humble pawn can bring down kingdoms
stop distracting me
poor little pawn
mean old king
so sad
but the final say
well
queen will have that
queen takes king
and you thought
this was just a game
with the mirror at her command
ravenna was invincible
she took her kingdom
as she had taken others before it
and as she would take
others again
with her sister freya at her side
is it love
truly
it is love truly
your move
why should i bother
you always win
you always let me win
i suppose you are my weakness
very well
queen to rook five
checkmate in three
learn from lost freya
and your day will come
your possibilities will be endless
once the magic awakens in your heart
it wont
we both know it wont
im not like you
all the women of our blood are gifted freya
and in time
you will find the source of your power
as ive found mine
well see
what
youre carrying his child
oh
you didnt know
well
hes promised to another
he does not love her
their engagement is sealed
and cannot be break
he will deny you
and he will deny your daughter
he will not
freya
im not being cruel
i simply wish to protect you
you may be surprised
how things turn out
you know much ravenna
but you do not know all
im afraid i do
freya did not believe her sister
for love blinds even the clearest eye
and when her daughter
was but a few weeks old
freyas trusting heart was rewarded at last
her lover had sent word
he would defile his family and
marry freya in secret in the royal garden
they would gather their child
and flee the kingdom
to begin a life of their own
freya dont
i had no choice
i had no choice freya
noooooooo
consumed by grief and anger
freya left his sister to seek a kingdom
of her own in the land far to the north
there the people would come
to fear her very name
burn it
kill them all
for if she could not raise a child
then in its place
she would raise an army
come on boy
no
eric
run
come on you runt
freya turned the once
green farm lands of the north
into a frozen wasteland
there she built her fortress
and rule as the ice queen
carretas
how lucky you are
youre with me now
and you will never know
this suffering again
you are scared
no
is it your father that you missed
your mother
yes
yes
tell me your name
tull
love is a lie
it is a trick played by the cruel
on the foolish and the weak
cast it from your mind
never let it render you
frail of mind or of will
because in my kingdom
there is but one law
do not love
its a sin
and ill not forgive it
now lets hear no more
of family and love
those illusions are beneath you
i have freed you from them
and in exchange for this precious gift
i ask only one thing
your loyalty
you will train
you will harden
you will become my elite
my huntsmen
and nothing will ever ever
destroy you
take it
one two three
strike
and so children grew to be soldiers
becoming one with blade and arrow
prepare your bows
draw
release
guard
the boy and the girl
who are they
what are their names
which
the best ones
eric and sara my queen
did i scare you
do you not know
i never miss
carretas
the new children sir
its about time
come on kids come on
hurry up get out come on
come on
dont worry
out
come on
move faster
pssst
what are you doing in there
i know who lives here
she scares me
uh youre right
she can be wee bit grumpy
from time to time
do you know what i do i just never
let her know what i am thinking
how do you do that
well can you make a mean face
thats not bad
what about like this
thats better
now thats your war face
if you wear that always
when the queen is near
shell never know what
youre thinking either
you do that and youll be fine
come on
the queen sent her army to wage war
against the great kings of the north
battle after battle
they returned victorious
those who were left alive
youve done well my children
very well
you forget to walk in shadow
and you forget your balance
what are you doing
well cant you tell you daft boy
im marrying you
it was my mothers
my only treasure
i lived for her
now
i live for you
how do we live for each other
in this place here
freya will take one look at us
and shell know what then
its almost day
gather your things
meet me in the courtyard
shell catch us
or she wont
but either way
we shall be free
you do love me dont you
aye i do
i give you my life and my death
stand or fall ill never leave your side
i swear it to you
i know this story
the girl goes in secret
to meet her one true love
i wonder how it ends this time
i gave you both everything
and in return
you betray me
for love
we fought your wars
weve done enough
please my queen
let us go
do not beg me
it is weak
you are weak
you want to leave
very well go to each other
if you can
and ill let you go
shouldnt be too hard
love conquers all
so ive heard
take him out of my sight
once upon a time
a man and a woman fell in love
but such things cannot last
for the heart is a treacherous thing
and love
love is nothing more
than a fairy tale
days turn to years
freyas empire continue to rise
while her sister ravennas fell at the hands
of the huntsman and snow white
but some evil
cannot truly be vanquished
seven years later
seven years later
in the kingdom of snow white
fan out
align the flanks
see you later love
your majesty
please my friend
how did you find me
it wasnt easy
oh nion
you sworn
well he
he friends put me in a big
big pot
what nonsense
we paid him 3 gold
is that all
3 each
who are you
gryff
at your service
bonds rewards debt collection
im his brother
he half brother
same mom
same mom
walk with me
i have come on a matter
of grave importance
well you should find some
gravely important people then
the mirror is gone
we believed its dark magic
died with ravenna
we were wrong
there is an evil within the mirror
that has only grown in power
the queen snow white has vowed
to rid her kingdom of it
before its darkness cannot be stopped
2 weeks ago the queen ordered
a detachment of soldiers
to take the mirror to sanctuary
they never returned
wait wait
im not your man
youre the best tracker
we have in the kingdom
as you say the mirror is evil
it mustnt fallen into the hands
of the wrong person
and snow white thinks
im the one to find it
she commands you
to find it
and deliver it to sanctuary where
its wickedness can forever be contained
do you accept or not
yes yes yes
he accepts
provided theres a reward
i dont want no reward
eric
snow white is unwell
the mirror
she said she couldnt stop looking at it
she can hear
its voice calling for her
thats why she sent it away
what was that thing
move all your forces
to the northern border
why
what do you know
freya queen of the north
that owl was her spy
now she knows about the mirror
and if she finds it everything you hold dear
will be covered in ice
move your men to the north
what are you two still doing here
we are your partners
no you are not
i am snow whites men as well
i meani mean dwarf
if shes in trouble i want to help
my queen
vardhelm has fallen
it was the last stronghold
the entire white lands
are yours
youve won
have i
the game is not finished
is this where the world ends
or is there more
my queen
the south cannot be conquered
snow whites lands are too vast
her armies are
did you know that eric was alive
did you
i
how
i swear to you i threw his body
thats alright
i prefer it this way
theres something that he seeks
i want it
my sisters mirror
it holds great power
and with it in my command
i can do great things
i will free every child
ill save them all
as ive saved you
and my army of huntsman will grow
until nothing will stand in its path
so you see
the game is not finished
prepare the huntsmen
they came through here
obviously
its to access to the northern road
leads directly to sanctuary
no need to be a huntsman to know that
hey nion
who am i
im talking to the dirt
i hear it speak to me
hes actually quite good at this gryff
hes stuff
hes a buffoon
we ride north
actually they headed west
the northern road cuts through a plain
no where to take cover
the western road
runs next to a forest
thats where they would have make camp
thats where were going to find them
obviously
shhh shhh shhhh
the dirt is talking to me again
whats it saying
its saying the mouthy one is an idiot
he wouldnt last a day on his own
and should go home
i agree
im not going home
till i get my reward
you want gold but all youre going
to find out here is death
a bit dramatic
dramatic yeah unless its true
we should consider it
a good warning
i know im not afraid
of freya of the frost
hey not so loud
keep your voice down
youre even more stupid than i thought
bloody hell
who would have attack them
out here in the open
keep your eyes peel
they could still be around
well look for tracks blood trails
anything
get off
these are their own arrows
their own blades
they killed each other
but why
these are all the queens men
the mirror was here
this is definitely not one of theirs
i grew up in the mines
its worth half the world
whoever it belongs to has the mirror
we need to find it
before freya does
whats this
we have to get off the road
im looking for information
youll not get much for that
well then
there was a wee massacre
on the road not far from here
the queen soldiers
you know anything about that
yeah they passed through here
a few days ago
they did
they didnt stop they werent thirsty
was anyone
anyone following them
oh a pint as well
i take that as a no
good day
a bit choosy for what shes offering
or perhaps you would have
better luck with your own kind
have you ever seen a female dwarf
no i cant say i have
horrifying
horrifying is the best of them
repulsive things
so assuming this is a
commonly held opinion
how exactly are new dwarfs made
uh generally by accident
to little light
too much of this
yeah
come on keep up
chilly with the door
pass me that
what
pass me some of that
you 3 looked like
youre far from home
aye aye
just seeking shelter and moving on
and these your children
your missus must be
quite a looker
thats a good one
what
what did he say
leave it aside
no no no
im not having it
you want to hold your tongue mate
before you loose it
is that so
yeah if it were just me own
i wouldnt be worried
if its me and him
i would be a tiny bit worried
because hes a bit of a waster
not true
but none of that matters
because we are with him
and he will gut you like a deer
quicker than you can blink
cos this man here
this man is the huntsman
is this true
are you the huntsman
thats me
well
the thing is
we are all huntsman
im sorry im sorry
its alright
wait
wait wait wait
can we not talk about this
you call yourself a huntsman
i expected more from a man who had
the courage to betray his queen
and for what
for the love of some spineless woman
maybe you were something
in your day brother
but that day is long gone
have you made your peace
ill be soon enough
tell freya i died a free man
freya doesnt care how you die
no one cares
youre already forgotten
fall back
fall back now
you have aged
sara
i tied you up
is she his wife or something
no it cant be
his wifes dead
dead
is that what you told everyone
you poor heartbroken widower
that story must have wet
the eyes of many young lass
maybe more than their eyes
no no no
youre dead
i saw you die
this is not real
its not happening
youre a ghost
or youre some
or some
im dead
am i not alive
youre alive
although you should be dead
you got hit on the head like six
what do you say six or seven
seven
seven times a lot
so this is
real
very
did you think i would forget
did you think i would forgive
stand or fall you said
youll never leave my side you said
you swore it
and then you fled
i see you fight
and i see you run
no no no sara
thats not what happened
i saw tull killed you
i saw him killed you with my own eyes
i would never leave you
but i saw you leave me
with my own eyes
and you of all people should know
tull could never kill me
sara
i
dont
i swear to you
she put me in her dungeon
for 7 years
and when i finally escape
i swore i would find you
its taken me a long time
but here we are
husband
and wife
you honestly believe that
that i abandon you
aye
you still forget your balance
shes got another knife
yeah yeah
she probably should have said so
shes got 2 more little ones
in her left boot
thats no longer important
if your face is the last thing
that im meant to see
then im grateful
it should be the last thing you see
i dont like her
i dont like her one little bit
my queen
no fire
no fire
its alright
so
what happens if freya
gets this mirror
dont you think that you and me
have other things to discuss
like us
no
what happens
shell be unstoppable
wheres my horse
i sent if off
why did you do that for
them horses make tracks
we keep off the road
well be safe
so youre coming with me then
no youre coming with me
whatever you need to tell yourself
thats fine
from what i can see your wee band
wont do too well without me
huh
whatever power this mirror contains
ill not let freya yield it
well find it and well bring it
to the sanctuary
and then you and i
will part forever
now
tell me about this
well hit callan crossing by nightfall
theres a market there
they might have sold the mirror
if an enemy uses diamonds for arrows
i doubt if hell sell
the mirror for money
well if you dont like my plan
you can piss off
oh
that is charming
and you can piss off too
you so elegantly put it
but thats not going to
get rid of me
youre still my wife
wewe were deceived
the ice wall that freya
put between us
she showed us
what she wanted us to see
wait
and what if im right
do we not deserve that chance
it wouldnt have matter
you would leave again
we blind ourselves to the truth
because we are weak
because we hope
but theres no hope for love
love ends in betrayal
aye and always
well i dont believe you
dont move
dont move
that looks familiar
a dwarf made trap
thats where i would have put it
yes
it will take more than that
to catch the like of us

just up the dorian river
on the northwest side of the sanctuary

huntsman what is this
stand tall brother
eric
my eric
your queen has missed you
youre not my queen freya
im forever your queen
isnt that right sara
you see
you abandon her eric
but not i
i raised her from despair
make her the point of my spear
my tempered steel
shes laid waste to kingdoms
and brought men such as you
to their knees
shes everything
that youre not
all i had to do is
sent her to you
and you lead her
straight to the mirror
its pathetic
oh what are these
dwarfs
they are just like children
were mighty far from children
bitch queen
adorable
bring me the mirror
youll have to kill me first
no
i wont
doreena no
you knew didnt you
you knew she would betray you
and you spared her still
have you learned my lesson at last
harden your heart queen of winter
bury the world in a tomb of ice
it matters not
love will endure
perhaps youre right
shall we find out
kill him
is he dead
i think so
what do we do
pull it out
go on
one two
quickly
bloody hell that hurt
i cant believe that she missed
she never misses
have you lost your mind
she betrayed us
eric shes not cupid
i doubt that an arrow to the chest
is an expression of her love
oh no no
there is a grand design
at work here friends
that grows even louder
head injury
number eight
she never misses
look im twice as angry as you are
doreena was the only friend
i had in this world
but you need to face facts
sara is not on your side
i dont need you
to believe what i believe
what are these for exactly
ill give you a hint
were not going to
carry them on our backs
so what are you gonna do
trek all the way to the frozen north
face down an evil sorceress
and her entire army
aye
all right im in
tull take the dwarfs to the gallery
and bring the mirror to my sanctum
welcome home sara
freya
come to me
say the words
speak the words
the age can be wicked
to those who walk alone
when i look into the mirror
i see myself as i might to become
yes
yes
mirror mirror on the wall
who is the fairest of them all
do not back away from me
you asked a question
the mirror has answered
ravenna how
are you not dead
yes
no
something in between
youve become quite literal freya
of all people you should know
that is but a vessel
i left my body
i went into the mirror
and there i stayed
i became part of it
trapped
until you release me
we have much to do little sister
with you and your army
by my side
i will regain my kingdom once more
snow white
shall kneel before me
she will beg for mercy
and then ill tear her heart out
ho
thats
thats a bit bigger than i imagined
so whats the plan
you have got a plan
aye
is it any good
no
but its simple
freya will be in her sanctum
below the steeple
ill make my way down from the top
find her and kill her
what about nion and doreena
i have got someone on the inside
who is going to help me find them
uh who
you
you have given my huntsmen new orders
better orders
we will attack tomorrow
in 2 waves
flanking maneuver
i presumed you would agree
its a far superior tactic
this is my kingdom
did you say something
this is my kingdom
of course it is
and it always will be
i would never question my sisters rule
but beyond these walls
is my kingdom
my dominion
do not forget what you owe me
i made you what you are
come on
move along
hauler your brother
keep walking
just keep walking
its not my sisters fault my lord
she was hit in the face as a baby
with a rock
you two come with me
did you have to hit him so hard
shut up
its very heavy
right
we stuff him in here
we cover our tracks
thats very sloppy work that is
this is the worst plan ever
my children
this is the day for which
for which you were born
youll face an army of men
who have never lost a war
men who have
who have forgotten
for what it means to be afraid
we will bring fear
once again to snow whites army
and their lands will be mine
and their children
their children
for i am queen
i am the queen
this is what i trained you for
this is why i raised you
this is why i made you
what you are
hello eric
ive missed you
guard
why
why
theyre in love
they reek of it
is this not your kingdom
it is
do you not have laws
i do
and what
is your judgment
death
traitors
traitors to who
your old queen
your new queen
you broke the law
the law
youve forgotten the ones
who loved you
your mothers your fathers
what law did they break
love does not make you weak
its all that ever give me strength
have we not fought side by side
we were children
brothers and sisters
do we not love each other
fight with me
if you die
die for something thats yours
why did you turn away freya
you deceived us
and now you deceive yourself
silence
why didnt you kill us back then
instead you break my heart
and turn her against me
pretty
you see huntsman
love doesnt save your life
i should know
ive been dead before
im sorry
im so sorry
stand or fall
together
i stand with you
aye
aye
aye
dont
stand back
nothing can save you huntsman
all thats left is pain
ravenna stop
stop
enough
we cant leave the mirror
then we climb
i thought ive driven
the weakness out of you
i thought i made you strong
but youre as pathetic
as you ever were
have you lost your mind
how did you make me strong
how did you draw the weakness out
what did you do
what did you do
i dont have to tell you anything
oh
oh but you do
you see you said it yourself
youre something between
this world and the mirror
i summoned you out
now you are bound to me
tell me the truth
mirror mirror on the wall
who is the fairest of them all
you are my queen
but not for long
your sister holds a baby
to her breast
a daughter
she will grow to be more beautiful
than even you
you cannot ask such a thing of me
i ask nothing
i am but a reflection
and you
you have already decided
kill
for me
kill for me
oh
i loved her
i loved you
thats why im stronger than you
leave my children alone
sorry
im sorry
i killed your daughter
and released the greatest power
within you
a power you have wasted
on nothing but cheap sentiment
did you not think
i wanted a child
did you not think
i wanted love
but these things
were not meant for me

there lived a beautiful queen
whos heart was broken in two
but even buried under ice and snow
love survives
not on your life
