an oft told tale 
that of snow white 
how she vanquished the evil queen ravenna 
and took her rightful place on the throne 
but there is another story 
one you have not yet seen 
one that comes long before
 happily ever after  
a mere pawn 
a humble pawn can bring down kingdoms 
stop distracting me 
poor little pawn 
mean old king 
so sad 
but the final say   
well 
queen  will have that 
queen takes king 
and you thought
this was just a game 
with the mirror at her command 
ravenna was invincible 
she took her kingdom
as she had taken others before it 
and as she would take
others again 
with her sister  freya  at her side
is it love 
truly 
it is love  truly 
your move 
why should i bother 
you always win 
you always let me win 
i suppose you are my weakness 
very well 
queen to rook five 
checkmate in three 
learn from lost  freya 
and your day will come 
your possibilities will be endless
once the magic awakens in your heart 
it won t 
we both know it won t 
i m not like you 
all the women of our blood are gifted  freya 
and in time   
you will find the source of your power 
as i ve found mine 
we ll see 
what 
you re carrying his child 
oh 
you didn t know 
well 
  he s promised to another 
  he does not love her 
their engagement is sealed
and cannot be break 
he will deny you 
and he will deny your daughter 
he will not 
freya 
i m not being cruel 
i simply wish to protect you 
you may be surprised
how things turn out 
you know much  ravenna 
but you do not know all 
i m afraid i do 
freya did not believe her sister 
for love blinds even the clearest eye 
and when her daughter
was but a few weeks old 
freya s trusting heart was rewarded at last 
her lover had sent word 
he would defile his family and
marry freya in secret in the royal garden 
they would gather their child
and flee the kingdom
to begin a life of their own 
freya  don t 
i had no choice 
i had no choice  freya 
nooooo   ooo  
consumed by grief and anger 
freya left his sister to seek a kingdom
of her own in the land far to the north 
there  the people would come
to fear her very name 
burn it 
kill them all 
for if she could not raise a child 
then in it s place
she would raise an army 
come on  boy 
no 
eric 
run 
come on  you runt 
freya turned the once
green farm lands of the north
into a frozen wasteland 
there she built her fortress 
and rule as the ice queen 
carretas 
how lucky you are 
you re with me now 
and you will never know
this suffering again 
you are scared 
no 
is it your father that you missed 
your mother 
  yes 
  yes 
tell me your name 
tull 
love is a lie 
it is a trick played by the cruel
on the foolish and the weak 
cast it from your mind 
never let it render you
frail of mind  or of will 
because in my kingdom
there is but one law 
 do not love  
it s a sin 
and i ll not forgive it 
now  let s hear no more
of family and love 
those illusions are beneath you 
i have freed you from them 
and in exchange for this precious gift 
i ask only one thing 
your loyalty 
you will train 
you will harden 
you will become my elite 
my huntsmen 
and nothing will ever  ever
destroy you 
take it 
one  two  three 
strike 
and so  children grew to be soldiers 
becoming one with blade and arrow 
prepare your bows 
draw 
release 
guard 
the boy and the girl 
who are they 
what are their names 
  which 
  the best ones 
eric and sara  my queen 
did i scare you 
do you not know 
i never miss 
carretas 
the new children  sir 
it s about time 
come on  kids  come on 
hurry up  get out  come on 
come on 
don t worry 
out 
come on 
move  faster 
pssst 
what are you doing in there 
i know who lives here 
she scares me 
uh  you re right 
she can be wee bit grumpy
from time to time 
do you know what i do  i just never
let her know what i am thinking 
how do you do that 
well  can you make a mean face 
that s not bad 
what about like this 
that s better 
now  that s your war face 
if you wear that always
when the queen is near 
she ll never know what
you re thinking either 
you do that and you ll be fine 
come on 
the queen sent her army to wage war
against the great kings of the north 
battle after battle 
they returned victorious 
those who were left alive 
you ve done well  my children 
very well 
you forget to walk in shadow 
and you forget your balance 
what are you doing 
well  can t you tell  you daft boy 
i m marrying you 
it was my mother s 
my only treasure 
i lived for her 
now   
i live for you 
how do we live for each other
in this place here 
freya will take one look at us
and she ll know  what then 
it s almost day 
gather your things 
meet me in the courtyard 
she ll catch us 
or she won t 
but either way   
we shall be free 
you do love me  don t you 
aye  i do 
i give you my life and my death 
stand or fall  i ll never leave your side 
i swear it to you 
i know this story 
the girl goes in secret
to meet her one true love 
i wonder how it ends this time 
i gave you both everything 
and in return 
you betray me 
for love 
we fought your wars 
we ve done enough 
please  my queen 
let us go 
do not beg me 
it is weak 
you are weak 
you want to leave 
very well  go to each other 
if you can 
and i ll let you go 
shouldn t be too hard 
love conquers all 
so i ve heard 
take him out of my sight 
once upon a time 
a man and a woman fell in love 
but such things cannot last 
for the heart is a treacherous thing 
and love   
love is nothing more
than a fairy tale 
days turn to years 
freya s empire continue to rise 
while her sister  ravenna s fell at the hands
of the huntsman and snow white 
but some evil   
cannot truly be vanquished 
seven years later   
seven years later   
in the kingdom of snow white 
fan out 
align the flanks  
see you later  love 
  your majesty 
  please  my friend 
how did you find me 
it wasn t easy 
oh  nion 
  you sworn 
  well  he   
he friends put me in a big   
big pot 
what nonsense 
we paid him 3 gold 
3 
is that all 
3 each 
  who are you 
  gryff 
at your service 
bonds  rewards  debt collection 
  i m his brother 
  he  half brother 
  same mom 
  same mom 
walk with me 
i have come on a matter
of grave importance 
well  you should find some
gravely important people then 
the mirror is gone 
we believed it s dark magic
died with ravenna 
we were wrong 
there is an evil within the mirror
that has only grown in power 
the queen snow white has vowed
to rid her kingdom of it
before it s darkness cannot be stopped 
2 weeks ago  the queen ordered
a detachment of soldiers
to take the mirror to sanctuary 
they never returned 
wait  wait 
i m not your man 
you re the best tracker
we have in the kingdom 
as you say  the mirror is evil 
it mustn t fallen into the hands
of the wrong person 
and snow white thinks
i m the one to find it 
she commands you
to find it 
and deliver it to sanctuary where
it s wickedness can forever be contained 
do you accept or not 
yes  yes  yes 
he accepts 
provided  there s a reward 
i don t want no reward 
eric 
snow white is unwell 
the mirror   
she said she couldn t stop looking at it 
she can hear
it s voice calling for her 
that s why she sent it away 
what was that thing 
move all your forces
to the northern border 
why 
what do you know 
freya  queen of the north 
that owl was her spy 
now  she knows about the mirror 
and if she finds it  everything you hold dear
will be covered in ice 
move your men to the north 
what are you two still doing here 
we are your partners 
no  you are not 
i am snow white s men as well 
i mean i mean dwarf 
if she s in trouble  i want to help 
my queen 
vardhelm has fallen 
it was the last stronghold 
the entire white lands
are yours 
you ve won 
have i 
the game is not finished 
is this where the world ends 
or is there more 
my queen 
the south cannot be conquered 
snow white s lands are too vast 
her armies are   
did you know that eric was alive 
did you 
i   
how 
  i swear to you i threw his body   
  that s alright 
i prefer it this way 
there s something that he seeks 
i want it 
my sister s mirror 
it holds great power 
and with it in my command 
i can do great things 
i will free every child 
i ll save them all 
as i ve saved you 
and my army of huntsman will grow
until nothing will stand in it s path 
so  you see 
the game is not finished 
prepare the huntsmen 
  they came through here 
  obviously 
it s to access to the northern road 
leads directly to sanctuary 
no need to be a huntsman to know that 
hey  nion 
who am i 
i m talking to the dirt 
i hear it speak to me 
he s actually quite good at this  gryff 
he s stuff 
he s a buffoon 
we ride north 
actually  they headed west 
the northern road cuts through a plain
no where to take cover 
the western road
runs next to a forest 
that s where they would have make camp 
that s where we re going to find them 
  obviously   
  shhh  shhh  shhhh 
  the dirt is talking to me again 
  what s it saying 
it s saying the mouthy one is an idiot 
he wouldn t last a day on his own
and should go home 
i agree 
i m not going home
till i get my reward 
you want gold  but all you re going
to find out here is death 
a bit dramatic 
dramatic  yeah  unless it s true 
we should consider it
a good warning 
i know i m not afraid
of freya of the frost 
hey  not so loud 
keep your voice down 
you re even more stupid than i thought 
bloody hell 
who would have attack them
out here in the open 
keep your eyes peel 
they could still be around 
we ll look for tracks  blood trails 
anything 
get off 
these are their own arrows 
their own blades 
they killed each other 
but why 
these are all the queen s men 
the mirror was here 
this is definitely not one of theirs 
i grew up in the mines 
it s worth half the world 
whoever it belongs to has the mirror 
we need to find it
before freya does 
what s this 
we have to get off the road 
i m looking for    information 
you ll not get much for that 
well  then 
there was a wee massacre
on the road not far from here 
the queen soldiers 
you know anything about that 
yeah  they passed through here
a few days ago 
  they did 
  they didn t stop  they weren t thirsty 
was anyone   
anyone following them 
oh  a pint as well 
i take that as a  no  
good day 
a bit choosy for what she s offering 
or perhaps you would have
better luck with your own kind 
have you ever seen a female dwarf 
  no  i can t say i have 
  horrifying 
horrifying is the best of them 
repulsive things 
so  assuming this is a
commonly held opinion 
how exactly are new dwarfs made 
uh  generally by accident 
to little light 
  too much of this 
  yeah 
come on  keep up 
chilly with the door 
pass me that 
  what 
  pass me some of that 
you 3 looked like
you re far from home 
aye  aye 
just seeking shelter and moving on 
and these your children 
your missus must be
quite a looker 
  that s a good one 
  what 
  what did he say 
  leave it aside 
no  no  no 
i m not having it 
you want to hold your tongue mate 
before you loose it 
is that so 
yeah  if it were just me own 
i wouldn t be worried 
if it s me and him 
i would be a tiny bit worried 
  because he s a bit of a waster 
  not true 
but none of that matters 
because we are with him 
and he will gut you like a deer 
quicker than you can blink 
 cos this man here   
this man is the huntsman 
is this true 
are you the huntsman 
that s me 
well 
the thing is   
we are all huntsman 
  i m sorry  i m sorry 
  it s alright 
wait 
wait  wait  wait   
can we not talk about this 
you call yourself a huntsman 
i expected more from a man who had
the courage to betray his queen 
and for what 
for the love of some spineless woman 
maybe you were something
in your day  brother 
but that day is long gone 
have you made your peace 
i ll be  soon enough 
tell freya i died a free man 
freya doesn t care how you die 
no one cares 
you re already forgotten 
fall back 
fall back now 
you have aged 
sara 
i tied you up 
is she his wife or something 
no  it can t be 
his wife s dead 
dead 
is that what you told everyone 
you poor heartbroken widower 
that story must have wet
the eyes of many young lass 
maybe more than their eyes 
no  no  no 
you re dead 
i saw you die 
this is not real 
it s not happening 
you re a ghost 
or you re some   
or some   
i m dead 
am i not alive 
you re alive 
although you should be dead 
you got hit on the head like six   
  what do you say  six or seven 
  seven 
seven times  a lot 
  so  this is   
  real 
very 
did you think i would forget 
did you think i would forgive 
 stand or fall   you said 
you ll never leave my side  you said 
you swore it 
and then you fled 
i see you fight
and i see you run 
no  no  no  sara 
that s not what happened 
i saw tull killed you 
i saw him killed you with my own eyes 
i would never leave you 
but i saw you leave me
with my own eyes 
and you of all people should know 
tull could never kill me 
sara 
i   
  don t 
  i swear to you 
she put me in her dungeon
for 7 years 
and when i finally escape 
i swore i would find you 
it s taken me a long time 
but here we are 
husband   
and wife 
you honestly believe that 
that i abandon you 
aye 
you still forget your balance 
she s got another knife 
yeah  yeah 
she probably should have said so 
she s got 2 more little ones
in her left boot 
that s no longer important 
if your face is the last thing
that i m meant to see 
then i m grateful 
it should be the last thing you see 
i don t like her 
i don t like her one little bit 
my queen 
no fire 
no fire 
it s alright 
so 
what happens if freya
gets this mirror 
don t you think that you and me 
have other things to discuss 
  like us 
  no 
what happens 
she ll be unstoppable 
  where s my horse 
  i sent if off 
  why did you do that for 
  them horses make tracks 
we keep off the road 
we ll be safe 
so  you re coming with me then 
no  you re coming with me 
whatever you need to tell yourself 
that s fine 
from what i can see  your wee band
won t do too well without me 
huh 
whatever power this mirror contains 
i ll not let freya yield it 
we ll find it and we ll bring it
to the sanctuary 
and then you and i   
will part forever 
now 
tell me about this 
we ll hit callan crossing by nightfall 
there s a market there 
they might have sold the mirror 
if an enemy uses diamonds for arrows
i doubt if he ll sell
the mirror for money 
well  if you don t like my plan 
you can piss off 
oh 
that is charming 
and you can piss off too 
you so elegantly put it 
but that s not going to
get rid of me 
you re still my wife 
we   we were deceived 
the ice wall that freya
put between us 
she showed us
what she wanted us to see 
wait 
and what if i m right 
do we not deserve that chance 
it wouldn t have matter 
you would leave again 
we blind ourselves to the truth
because we are weak 
because we hope 
but there s no hope for love 
love ends in betrayal 
aye  and always 
well  i don t believe you 
don t move 
don t move 
that looks familiar 
a dwarf made trap 
that s where i would have put it 
yes 
it will take more than that 
to catch the like of us    
oh  no 
what 
it was unexpected 
oh  oh what 
the hidden dwarf trap was unexpected 
you re not the tracker
you think you are 
i ve been a little distracted 
hey  doreena 
we ve got some of   
catch of the day 
catch of the day

and look ugly and stupid 
and say nothing else 
goblins real 
finest thieves in the world 
and greedy as the day is long 
  which we want to catch one 
  yeah 
you know  they say their armor
is made of gold 
  where can we find them 
  not far 
there s a hidden forest
just up the dorian river 
on the northwest side of the sanctuary 
they say they keep all their treasure
there in that wood 
gold  silver  jewels 
as far as the eye can see 
if your mirror shine 
it would be in there somewhere 
could we access the sanctuary from there 
don t know 
maybe 
will you show us a way 
well  you see  that s where
the proposition comes in 
you see  no one s ever
come out of them woods alive 
you two big one 
you look like huntsman 
and huntsmen are pretty handy
with the blade  yeah 
we all go in together 
you get your mirror 
me and doreena fill our pockets
with as much loot as we can carry 
deal

that one time we were
caught up in a net together 
that was a long long time ago 
and you know the hero
of every story you tell 
aye  that s because i m very brave 
which is why i m going to

we did not ask for this life 
eric  i ve done   
terrible things 
unforgivable things 
i know 
so have i 
maybe you and me are not
worthy of forgiveness 
that s for someone else to judge 
but we are worthy of each other

my tempered steel 
she s laid waste to kingdoms
and brought men such as you
to their knees 
she s everything
that you re not 
all i had to do is
sent her to you
and you lead her
straight to the mirror 
it s pathetic 
oh  what are these

harden your heart  queen of winter 
bury the world in a tomb of ice 
it matters not

i doubt that an arrow to the chest
is an expression of her love 
oh  no  no 
there is a grand design
at work here  friends 
that grows even louder 
head injury 
number eight 
she never misses 
look  i m twice as angry as you are 
doreena was the only friend
i had in this world 
but you need to face facts 
sara is not on your side 
i don t need you
to believe what i believe 
what are these for exactly 
i ll give you a hint 
we re not going to
carry them on our backs 
so what are you gonna do 
trek all the way to the frozen north 
face down an evil sorceress
and her entire army 
aye 
all right  i m in 
tull  take the dwarfs to the gallery
and bring the mirror to my sanctum 
welcome home  sara 
freya   
come to me   
say the words   
speak the words   
 the age can be wicked
to those who walk alone 
when i look into the mirror 
i see myself as i might to become  
yes   
yes   
mirror  mirror on the wall 
who is the fairest of them all 
do not back away from me 
you asked a question 
the mirror has answered 
ravenna  how 
are you not dead 
yes 
no 
something in between 
you ve become quite literal  freya 
of all people  you should know 
that  is but a vessel 
i left my body 
i went into the mirror 
and there i stayed 
i became part of it 
trapped 
until you release me 
we have much to do  little sister 
with you and your army
by my side 
i will regain my kingdom once more 
snow white   
shall kneel before me 
she will beg for mercy 
and then i ll tear her heart out 
ho 
that s   
that s a bit bigger than i imagined 
so what s the plan 
you have got a plan 
aye 
is it any good 
no 
but it s simple 
freya will be in her sanctum 
below the steeple 
i ll make my way down from the top 
find her  and kill her 
what about nion and doreena 
i have got someone on the inside
who is going to help me find them 
uh  who 
you 
you have given my huntsmen new orders 
better orders 
we will attack tomorrow
in 2 waves 
flanking maneuver 
i presumed you would agree 
it s a far superior tactic 
this is my kingdom 
did you say something 
this is my kingdom 
of course it is 
and it always will be 
i would never question my sister s rule 
but beyond these walls 
is my kingdom 
my dominion 
do not forget what you owe me 
i made you what you are 
come on 
move along 
hauler your brother 
keep walking 
just keep walking 
it s not my sister s fault  my lord 
she was hit in the face as a baby 
with a rock 
you two  come with me 
  did you have to hit him so hard 
  shut up 
it s very heavy 
right 
we stuff him in here 
we cover our tracks 
that s very sloppy work  that is 
this is the worst plan ever 
my children   
this is the day for which   
for which you were born 
you ll face an army of men
who have never lost a war 
men who have   
who have forgotten   
for what it means to be afraid 
we will bring fear   
once again    to snow white s army 
and their lands will be mine 
and their children   
their children   
for i am queen 
i am the queen 
this is what i trained you for 
this is why i raised you 
this is why i made you
what you are 
hello  eric 
i ve missed you 
guard 
why 
why 
they re in love 
they reek of it 
is this not your kingdom 
it is 
do you not have laws 
i do 
and what   
    is your judgment 
death 
traitors 
traitors to who 
your old queen 
your new queen 
  you broke the law 
  the law 
you ve forgotten the ones
who loved you 
your mothers  your fathers 
what law did they break 
love does not make you weak 
it s all that ever give me strength 
have we not fought side by side 
we were children 
brothers and sisters 
do we not love each other 
fight with me 
if you die 
die for something that s yours 
why did you turn away  freya 
you deceived us 
and now you deceive yourself 
  silence 
  why didn t you kill us back then 
instead you break my heart
and turn her against me 
pretty 
you see  huntsman 
love doesn t save your life 
i should know 
i ve been dead before 
i m sorry 
i m so sorry 
stand or fall 
together 
  i stand with you 
  aye 
  aye 
  aye 
don t 
stand back 
nothing can save you  huntsman 
all that s left is pain  
ravenna  stop 
stop 
enough  
we can t leave the mirror 
then we climb 
i thought i ve driven
the weakness out of you 
i thought i made you strong 
but you re as pathetic
as you ever were 
have you lost your mind 
how did you make me strong 
how did you draw the weakness out 
what did you do 
what did you do 
i don t have to tell you anything 
oh 
oh  but you do 
you see  you said it yourself 
you re something between
this world and the mirror 
i summoned you out 
now  you are bound to me 
tell me the truth 
mirror  mirror on the wall 
who is the fairest of them all 
you are  my queen 
but not for long 
your sister holds a baby
to her breast 
a daughter 
she will grow to be more beautiful
than even you 
you cannot ask such a thing of me 
i ask nothing 
i am but a reflection 
and you   
you have already decided 
kill   
for me   
kill for me   
oh 
i loved her 
i loved you 
that s why i m stronger than you 
leave my children alone 
sorry 
i m sorry 
i killed your daughter 
and released the greatest power
within you 
a power you have wasted
on nothing but cheap sentiment 
did you not think
i wanted a child 
did you not think
i wanted love 
but these things   
    were not meant for me 
i have a higher calling 
do you still believe   
    that love conquers all 
maybe not all 
just you 
are you ready  huntsman 
aye 
nooooooo    
how lucky you are 
come on 
breathe 
oh  breathe 
i m alright 
  are you alright 
  are you alright 
  yeah 
  yeah 
look  the sun 
once upon a time 
there lived a beautiful queen 
who s heart was broken in two 
but even buried under ice and snow   
love survives 
  not on your life 
  fine  fine  fine 
you re going to give up that easily 
god  you re stupid 
the lands of the north were free
