lights was a hard choice
cities in brownout
food shortages
cars burning fuel to run
but that was the past
where are we now
how do we make the world so much better
make deserts bloom
right now we are the largest
producer of fusion energy in the world
the energy of the sun
trapped in rock
harvested by machine from
the far side of the moon
today we deliver enough
cleanburning helium3
to supply the energy needs
of nearly 70 of the planet
who would have thought that all
energy we ever needed
is right above our heads
the power of the moon
the power of our future

hello
distant conversation
gerty the new sam is in reworking order
but we only have two
working harvesters now
overmeyers sarcastically
yeah wellwhat a surprise
thompson gerty were going to have to
find a way to ramp up production
gerty i know
overmeyers this is incredible
but how do you manage to destroy
a fucking rover a harvester and
an employee all on the same day
these were extraordinary
circumstances as you know
thompson
gerty what is the status on harvester 3
how do the repairs look on stopped
sam youre out of bed
yeah
i wanted to stretch my legs a bit
who was that
weve been having some problems
with the lunarsat

youre not ready to walk around yet
can you bring me my sunglasses
its really bright in here
give me some
give me all my stuff you know
your belongings are in your quarters sam
well bring them in here
certainly
excellent sam
whatwhen can i get out of here gerty
sam you may have suffered
from brain damage in the crash
this would explain your slight memory
loss and logic impairment
so whats the diagnosis
when can i get back to work
central has asked me to
slow down the harvesters
to ensure you have time to
recuperate and get your strength back
sarcastically thats terrific
thats fantastic
you can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow
but it will still be a few more days before you
can resume anything like a normal work schedule
lets try another test
i dont want to try another test
please sam
hey gerty
do you know about this
matthew has got no velocity readout
he is completely still
he must have stalled

dont you think we should tell central
unlock the doors and ill go fix it
i will pass on your message
gerty message received from earth
via jupiter link

what about the other clones
what
we might not be the first two
to have been woken up
you said that that model had already
been started when you got here
well who started it
there might be others up here right now
think about it how did i get up
here so quickly after your crash
i dont know
they didnt ship me in from central
there wasnt time
i must have come from the base
i dont know what youre smoking why would
they do that thats ridiculous
impossible
i bet theres some kind of secret room
secret room
yeah a secret room why not
you know you are the one that has lost your marbles
ive been here three years man
i know every inch of this base
and i know how many dirt is between
those wall panels over there
why would they do that
whats the motive
look its a company right
they have investors they have shareholders
shit like that
whats cheaper spending time and
money training new personnel
or you just have a couple of
spares here to do the job
its the far side of the moon
those cheap fucks havent even
fixed the communication satellite yet
tess would know she would have told me
hey gepetto wake up
you really think they give a shit about us
theyre laughing all the way to the bank
tess would know she would have told me
where do you get off
fucking sitting there sulking
like a little fucking boy
jesus christ

buried treasure too

to be able to contact earth they lied to us
theyve been lying to us since the beginning
theyve been lying since forever
