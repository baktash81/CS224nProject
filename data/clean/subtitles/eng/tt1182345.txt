lights was a hard choice 
cities in brownout    
food shortages 
cars burning fuel to run 
but that was the past 
where are we now 
how do we make the world so much better 
make deserts bloom 
right now  we are the largest
producer of fusion energy in the world 
the energy of the sun 
trapped in rock 
harvested by machine from
the far side of the moon 
today  we deliver enough
clean burning helium 3   
to supply the energy needs
of nearly 70  of the planet 
who would have thought that all
energy we ever needed
is right above our heads 
the power of the moon   
the power of our future

you had an accident 
do you remember what happened

i don t remember a thing 
do you remember me 
yeah  of course i remember you  gerty 
that s good  that is very good 
it s nice to see you awake again 
i d like to keep you under observation
here in the infirmary for a few days   
and run some tests 
how long have i been out 
not long  sam 
go back to sleep 
  ok  pal 
  you re still very tired 
we can talk later 
hello 
 distant conversation 
 gerty   the new sam is in reworking order 
but we only have two
working harvesters now 
 overmeyers    sarcastically 
yeah  well what a surprise 
 thompson   gerty  we re going to have to
find a way to ramp up production 
 gerty   i know 
 overmeyers   this is incredible 
but how do you manage to destroy   
a fucking rover  a harvester and
an employee all on the same day 
these were extraordinary
circumstances  as you know 
 thompson  
gerty  what is the status on harvester 3 
how do the repairs look on     stopped 
  sam  you re out of bed 
  yeah 
i wanted to stretch my legs a bit 
who was that 
we ve been having some problems
with the lunar sat   
and our live feed seems to be down 
i was recording a video message for central   
updating them on your progress 
sam  you need to stay in bed 
you re not ready to walk around yet 
can you bring me my sunglasses 
it s really bright in here 
give me some   
give me all my stuff  you know 
your belongings are in your quarters  sam 
  well  bring them in here 
  certainly 
excellent  sam 
what   when can i get out of here  gerty 
sam  you may have suffered
from brain damage in the crash 
this would explain your slight memory
loss and logic impairment 
so what s the diagnosis 
when can i get back to work 
central has asked me to
slow down the harvesters   
to ensure you have time to
recuperate and get your strength back 
 sarcastically  that s terrific 
that s fantastic 
you can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow 
but it will still be a few more days before you
can resume anything like a normal work schedule 
let s try another test 
i don t want to try another test 
please  sam 
hey  gerty 
do you know about this 
matthew has got no velocity readout 
he is completely still 
he must have stalled 
well  he has obviously stalled 
don t you think we should tell central 
unlock the doors and i ll go fix it 
i will pass on your message 
 gerty   message received from earth
via jupiter link 
 thompson   sam  we appreciate the offer 
but you concentrate on feeling better 
 overmeyers   yeah  we don t want
you to take any unnecessary risks 
  you are too important to us 
  you stay put 
 overmeyers   that is an order 
 thompson   it s an order  sam   
from lunar 
 overmeyers  
and what we re going to do is send a rescue unit   
to tend to the stalled harvester
and get the base back on its feet 
   under breath  fuck is with     what the fuck 
  i m sorry  sam 
  what 
  sam   
i m under strict orders not to let you outside 
i don t appreciate that being treated like a child 
i don t appreciate it 
gerty 
gerty 
gerty  come here 
  what happened 
  i do not know  maybe a meteorite   
there have been no meteorites  sam 
micrometeorites  maybe  i do not know 
either way  there might be
damage to the exterior shell 
i think you better   you better
let me go outside and take a look 
there is no damage to the exterior shell 
well  it s not that i don t believe you  gerty   
but  you know  this thing is
springing leaks like an acme firehose 
you need to let me go outside
and fix this problem  gery 
i can t let you go outside  sam 
gerty  if you don t let me go outside 
we can t fix this leak 
i m not permitted to let you go outside

you know  you are the one that has lost your marbles 
i ve been here three years  man 
i know every inch of this base 
and i know how many dirt is between
those wall panels over there 
why would they do that 
what s the motive 
look  it s a company  right 
they have investors  they have shareholders 
shit like that 
what s cheaper  spending time and
money training new personnel   
or you just have a couple of
spares here to do the job 
it s the far side of the moon 
those cheap fucks haven t even
fixed the communication satellite yet 
  tess would know  she would have told me

minor brain damage and memory loss 
i kept you under observation
and ran some tests 
i remember  yea  i remember that   
sam  there was no crash 
you were being awakened 
it is standard procedure for
all new clones to be given tests   
 to establish mental stability  
and general physical health 
genetic abnormalities and minor
duplication errors in the dna   
can have considerable impact on

i walked in on gerty talking with central 
he was having a live conversation 
 a live conversation  
  yeah
  how do you know it was a live conversation 
because it was a back and forth exchange 
communications equipment was damaged 
there was a solar storm 
  it was live  man  it was live 
  that s impossible  there was a flare  it fried the satellite 
the satellite is fine  they don t want us
to be able to contact earth  they lied to us 
they ve been lying to us since the beginning 
they ve been lying since forever 
if the satellite works  how are they
blocking the live feed from down here 
everything works fine 
maybe they re not blocking the signal from inside the base
