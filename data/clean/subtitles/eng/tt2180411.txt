at the edge of the woods 
i wish
and in this village   
more than anything
   lived a young maiden   
more than life
more than jewels
   a carefree young lad

more than life
   and a childless baker   
i wish
   with his wife 
  more than anything
  more than the moon
i wish

two daughters of her own 
  look at your nails
  look at your dress
  people would laugh at you
  nevertheless
she still wants to go to the festival
and dance before the prince
all three
were beautiful of face 
but vile and black of heart 
the young lad had no father 
and his mother   
i wish
   well 
she was at her wits  end 
i wish my son were not a fool
i wish my house was not a mess
i wish the cow was full of milk
i wish the walls were full of gold
i wish a lot of things

inside the house 
i thought if he were nice and warm 
he might produce some milk 
it s a she 
how many times do
i have to tell you that
only  she  s can give milk 
and then 
there was a hungry little girl 
who always wore a red cape 
hey

a loaf of bread please
to bring my poor old hungry granny
in the woods
just a loaf of bread

cinderella 
if you can pick up these lentils 
and finish your chores in time 
then you may go to the ball with us 
come along  ladies 
yes  mother 
good luck 
come  little birds
down from the eaves and the leaves
over fields  out of castles and ponds
no  squeeze  pal
quick  little birds
flick through the ashes
pick and peck  but swiftly
sift through the ashes
into the pot
oh 
bull s eye 
what are you doing 
stop your pretending 
now listen to me well  son 
milky white must be taken to market 
mother  no 
he s the best cow in the world 
was  she has been dry for weeks now 
we ve no food or money
and no choice but to sell her 
but milky white s my best friend 
look at her 
there are bugs on her dugs
there are flies in her eyes
there s a lump on her rump
big enough to be a hump
  but  mother   
  we ve no time to sit and dither
while her withers wither with her
and no one keeps a cow for a friend
sometimes i wonder
what s going on in that head of yours 
into the woods 
it s time to go
i hate to leave  i have to  though
into the woods  it s time and so
  i must begin my journey
  uh uh uh uh 
into the woods and through the trees
to where i am expected  ma am
into the woods  to grandmother s house
  stop it 
  i can t just   
into the woods 
to grandmother s house
are you certain of your way 
the way is clear
the light is good
i have no fear
nor no one should
the woods are just trees
the trees are just wood
i sort of hate to ask it
but do you have a basket 
yes  we do 
i don t suppose you re planning
on buying any of these 
oh  shh 
now  don t stray and be late  all right 
you might save some of those sweets
for granny 
  oh  my   
  just leave it 
she s a thief 
into the woods and down the dell
the path is straight  i know it well
into the woods  and who can tell
what s waiting on the journey
into the woods to bring some bread
to granny who is sick in bed
never can tell what lies ahead
for all that i know  she s already dead
but into the woods
into the woods
into the woods  to grandmother s house
and home before dark
cinderella

back to the eaves and the leaves
and the fields and the   
hurry up and do my hair  cinderella

mother said be good
father said be nice
that was always their advice
so be nice  cinderella

if everyone is blind
always leaving you behind

not that tight 
clod 
who might that be 
we ve sold our last loaf of bread 
it s the witch from next door 
we have no bread 
i don t want your bread 
then what is it you wish 
it s not what i wish 
it s what you wish 
nothing cooking in that belly now 
is there 
and there will never be 
unless
you do exactly as i say 
in three days  time 
a blue moon will appear 
only then can
the curse be undone 
what curse 
the one i placed on this house 
what are you talking about 
in the past 
when you were
no more than a babe 
your father brought his young wife
and you to this cottage 
they were a lovely couple 
but not lovely neighbors 
you see  your mother was with child 
and she developed an unusual appetite 
she admired my beautiful garden 
and she told your father
that what she wanted
more than anything in the world   
was greens  greens
nothing but greens
parsley  peppers  cabbages and celery
asparagus and watercress
and fiddleferns and lettuce
he said   all right 
but it wasn t  quite
 cause i caught him in the autumn
in my garden one night
he was robbing me
raping me
rooting through my rutabaga
raiding my arugula
and ripping up the rampion
my champion  my favorite
i should ve laid a spell
on him right there 
i could ve turned him into stone 
or a dog 
or a chair 
but i let him have the rampion
i d lots to spare
in return  however
i said   fair is fair
 you can let me have the baby
that your wife will bear
 and we ll call it square 
i had a brother 
no 
but you had a sister 
where is she 
she s mine now 
and you ll never find her 
a small price to pay
for what else your father stole from me 
it cost me my youth  my beauty 
my mother warned me
she would punish me with the curse
of ugliness if i ever lost any of them 
lost what 
the beans
  beans 
  the special beans
i let him go
i didn t know he d stolen my beans
i was watching him crawl
back over the wall
when bang  crash
a lightning flash
well  that s another story
never mind  anyway
at last  the big day came
i made my claim
 oh  don t take away the baby 
they shrieked and squeaked
but i did  and i hid her
where she ll never be reached
your father cried
and your mother died
when for extra measure
i admit  it was a pleasure
i said   sorry 
i m still not mollified 
and i laid a little spell on them
you  too  son 
that your family tree would always be
a barren one 
oh 
how could you do that 
and when your mother died 
your father deserted you 
your father was no father 
so why should you be 
i m so sorry 
i m so sorry 
now there s no more fuss
and there s no more scenes
and my garden thrives
you should see my nectarines
but i m telling you the same
i tell kings and queens
don t ever  never  ever
mess around with my greens
especially the beans
yeah  but why do we
have to go to the next village 
because everyone in this village knows
the cow hasn t given
a drop of milk in weeks 
but that s cheating 
we re starving  jack 
don t you understand that 
now  you re not to accept
less than five pounds for her 
are you listening to me 
yes 
how much are you to ask 
no more than five pounds 
  less than five 
  than five 
into the woods 
the time is now
we have to live  i don t care how
into the woods to sell the cow
you must begin the journey
straight through the woods 
and don t delay
we have to face the marketplace
into the woods to journey s end
into the woods to sell a friend
you wish to have the curse reversed 
i ll need a certain potion first 
go to the wood and bring me back   
one  the cow as white as milk 
two  the cape as red as blood 
three  the hair as yellow as corn 
four  the slipper as pure as gold 
bring me these
before the chime of midnight
in three days  time 
 tis then the blue moon reappears 
which comes but once
each hundred years 
bring them and i guarantee
a child as perfect as child can be 
oh 
go to the wood 
whoa 
ladies  our carriage awaits 
now may i go
to the festival 
the festival 
darling  those nails
darling  those clothes
the lentils are one thing
but darling  with those
you d make us the fools of the festival
and mortify the prince
the festival lasts three nights 
surely  you can let me be there
for one of them 
the king is trying to find his son a wife 
not a scullery maid 
we must be gone 
oh 
stop it 
come on 
go 
i wish   
look what i found  here  take this 
i m not wearing that 
  why 
  it was my father s 
you heard what she said 
this is all his fault 
i want nothing to do with him 
beans 
oh  these must be the witch s beans 
we ll take them with us 
  we 
  yes 
we  you re not coming 
it s not safe out there 
i can help you 
no  i can do this on my own 
the spell is on my house
only i can lift the spell
no  no  the spell is on our house
we must lift the spell together
the spell is on our house
now  remind me 
what am i to return with 
you don t remember 
the cow as white as milk
the cape as red as blood
the hair as yellow as corn
the slipper as pure as gold
the cow as white as milk
the cape as red as blood
the hair as yellow as corn
the slipper as pure as gold
i still wish to go to the festival
but how am i ever to get to the festival 
i know 
i ll visit mother s grave
the grave at the willow tree
and tell her i just want to go
to the king s festival
into the woods  it s time to go
it may be all in vain  you know
into the woods  but even so
i have to take the journey
into the woods  the path is straight
you know it well
but who can tell 
into the woods to lift the spell
into the woods to visit mother
into the woods to sell the cow
to get the money
to go to the festival
into the woods  to grandmother s house
into the woods  to grandmother s house
the way is clear
the light is good
i have no fear
nor no one should
the woods are just trees
the trees are just wood
no need to be afraid there
there s something in the glade there
into the woods without delay
but careful not to lose the way
into the woods  who knows what may
be lurking on the journey
into the woods to get the thing
that makes it worth the journeying
into the woods to see the king
  to sell the cow
  to make the potion
to see  to sell
to get  to bring
to make  to lift
to go to the festival
into the woods
to see  to sell  to get  to bring
  into the woods
  to make  to lift  to go to the festival
into the woods
into the woods
into the woods
then out of the woods
to see  to sell
to get  to bring
to make  to lift
to go to the festival
into the woods
then out of the woods
and home before dark
deep within the woods
cinderella had planted a branch
at the grave of her mother 
and she visited there so often 
and wept so much
that her tears watered it
until it had become a magnificent tree 
i wish   
what is it that you wish  child 
do you know
what you wish 
are you certain what you wish
ls what you want 
if you know what you want
then make a wish
ask the tree
and you shall have your wish
thank you  mother 
on her path to granny s 
the little girl suddenly found herself
in a very unusual part of the wood 
good day  young lady 
good day  mr  wolf 
whither away so hurriedly 
to my grandmother s 
and what might be in your basket 
some bread 
for grandmother 
so she ll have something good
to make her strong 
and where might your grandmother live 
a good quarter of a league further
in the woods 
her house stands
inside a great oak tree 
look at that flesh
pink and plump
hello  little girl
tender and fresh
not one lump
hello  little girl
this one s especially lush
delicious
hello  little girl
what s your rush 
you re missing all the flowers
the sun won t set for hours
take your time
mother said   straight ahead 
not to delay or be misled
but slow  little girl
hark and hush
the birds are singing sweetly
you ll miss the birds completely
you re traveling so fleetly
grandmother first
then miss plump
what a delectable couple
utter perfection
one brittle  one supple
  one moment  my dear
  mother said   come what may
 follow the path and never stray 
just so  little girl
any path
so many worth exploring
just one would be so boring
and look what you re ignoring
think of those crisp  aging bones
then something fresh on the palate
think of that scrumptious carnality
twice in one day
there s no possible way
to describe what you feel
when you re talking to your meal
for granny 
mother said not to stray
still  i suppose  a small delay
granny might like a fresh bouquet
goodbye  mr  wolf
goodbye  little girl
and hello
what are you waiting for 
get the cape 
you frightened me 
get it  get it  get it  get it 
how am i supposed to get it 
you go up to the little thing 
and you take it 
i can t just take a cloak
from a little girl 
  why don t you take it 
  it s the rules 
why do you think i asked you
to do it in the first place 
i m not allowed to touch
any of the objects 
get me what i need 
get me what i need 
hello there  little girl 
hello  mr  baker 
have you saved some of those sweets
for granny 
i ate all the sweets
and half a loaf of bread 
so i see 
now  tell me  where did you
get that beautiful cape 
  my granny made it for me 
  is that so 
i would love a
red cape like that 
you would look pretty foolish 
i would  wouldn t i 
may i take a look at it 
  no 
  no  i need it badly 
it s mine 
give it back 
give it back 
i m sorry  i m sorry 
i just wanted to make sure
that you really loved that cape 
now off you go to granny s 
and be careful that
no wolf comes your way 
i d rather a wolf than you any day 
this is hopeless 
i m never gonna find that red cape 
or a yellow slipper and a golden cow 
oh  wait  is it a golden slipper
and a yellow cow 
the cow as white as milk
the cape as red as blood
the hair as yellow as corn
the slipper as pure as   
  what are you doing here 
  you forgot your scarf 
you shouldn t be here 
it s not safe in these woods 
  i want to help 
  no 
  the spell is on my house
  our house
only i can lift the spell
  we must lift the spell together
  the spell is on my house
the spell is on   
a cow as white as   
milk 
go 
  hello there  young lad 
  hello  sir 
what might you be doing
with a cow in the middle of the forest 
i was heading towards market 
but i seem to have lost my way 
 what are you planning on doing there  
what are you planning on doing there 
sell my cow  sir 
no less than five pounds 
five pounds 
where are we supposed
to get five pounds 
she must be very generous of milk
to fetch five pounds 
yes  ma am 
um  and if you can t fetch that sum 
then what are you to do 
i hadn t thought of that 
this is all we have 
beans 
oh  no  we mustn t give up our beans 
well  if you feel that we must 
beans in exchange for my cow 
oh  no  son 
these are no ordinary beans 
these beans  they carry magic 
magic 
what kind of magic 
tell him 
it s  uh   
  it s a magic that defies description 
  yes 
  how many beans 
  six 
  five 
  five 
they re worth a pound each  at least 
could i buy my cow back someday 
  well    possibly 
  yes 
so  yeah 
it seems like we ve made a fair trade 
okay 
here you go 
there s one  two 
three  four  five 
all right  well  good luck 
and pleasure doing business with you 
one day  i ll buy you back 
promise 
take the cow and go home 
i was just trying to help 
magic beans 
we ve no reason to believe
they re magic 
are we to dispel this curse
through deceit 
no one would have given him
more for this creature 
we did him a favor 
at least they ll have some food now 
five beans 
  do you want a child or not 
  of course i do 
we have one chance 
don t you see that 
and if we fail   
i m not sure i m cut
out to be a father 
why would you say that 
because of my father 
you re not him 
i don t know 
if you can t do this for yourself 
can t you at least do it for me 
okay  fine 
but will you take the cow and go home 
i will find the rest of the things
on my own 
stay 
rapunzel 
rapunzel 
let down your hair to me 
rapunzel 
the old enchantress
had given the name rapunzel
to the child she had hidden away
and locked in a doorless tower 
but little did she know
that the girl s lilting voice
had caught the attention
of a handsome prince 
rapunzel 
don t you look lovely today  my dear 
thank you  mother 
i brought your favorite 
blackberries 
fresh from the garden 
as the little girl
approached her granny s oak tree 
she was surprised to see
the door standing open 
oh  dear 
how uneasy i feel 
perhaps it s all the sweets 
granny 
come in  my dearie 
my  grandmother 
you re looking very strange 
what big ears you have 
the better to hear you with 
my dear 
and with a single bound
the big  bad wolf had
devoured the little girl 
well  it was a full day of eating for both 
help  get us out 
i can t believe i just did that 
wait 
aren t you gonna help us
skin that beast 
no  no 
no thanks 
what kind of hunter are you 
i m a baker 
wait a minute  i never thanked you 
you need to be more careful 
young lady 
i m sorry 
i should have known better 
mother said 
 straight ahead 
not to delay or be misled
i should have heeded her advice
but he seemed so nice
and he showed me things
many beautiful things
that i hadn t thought to explore
they were off my path
so i never had dared
i had been so careful
i never had cared
and he made me feel excited
well  excited and scared
when he said   come in 
with that sickening grin
how could i know what was in store 
once his teeth were bared 
though i really got scared
well  excited and scared
but he drew me close
and he swallowed me down
down a dark  slimy path
where lie secrets
that i never want to know
whoa 
and when everything familiar
seemed to disappear forever
at the end of the path
was granny once again
so we lay in the dark
till you came and set us free
and you brought us to the light
and we re back at the start
and i know things now
many valuable things
that i hadn t known before
do not put your faith
in a cape and a hood
they will not protect you
the way that they should
and take extra care with strangers
even flowers have their dangers
and though scary is exciting
nice is different than good
mr  baker  you saved our lives 
here 
  are you certain 
  yes 
maybe granny will make me another one
out of the skins of that wolf 
thank you 
thank you 
ugh 
now i know  don t be scared
granny is right  just be prepared
isn t it nice to know a lot
and a little bit
not
how could you do this 
what sort of boy exchanges
a cow for beans 
but they re magic 
the man said 
oh  get your head
out of the clouds  jack 
ow 
mother  no 
go on  get in there 
you and your worthless adventures 
jack  will you never learn 
to bed without supper for you 
beans 
the first night
of the festival ball
brought cinderella her wish 
the prince danced only with her 
till he turned 
and she had slipped away 
that way 
quickly 
i must find that girl 
oh 
oh 
  are you all right  miss 
  yes 
i just need to catch my breath 
oh  what a beautiful gown 
were you at the king s festival 
  yes 
  ooh

why ever are you in the woods
at this hour 
this way 
please don t let them know that i m here

in a ball gown pass through 
i don t think so  sir 
if i may  my lord 
i think i see her over there

they say that he s charming
we did nothing but dance
yes 
  and 
  and it made a nice change
no  the prince
  oh  the prince
  yes  the prince
he has charm for a prince  i guess
you guess 
i don t meet a wide range
and it s all very strange
but why would you run away 
it s not quite what i expected 
what 
princes and castles and gowns 
i have no experience with those things 
but you will return to
the festival tomorrow eve 
yes 
no 
i don t know 
you don t know 
oh

i must get home 
no  wait

milky white 
one midnight gone

mr  baker 
mr  baker 
good fortune 
good fortune  sir 
look what i have 
five gold pieces 
how would you come by
five gold pieces 
there are giants in the sky
there are big  tall 
terrible giants in the sky
when you re way up high
and you look below
at the world you ve left
and the things you know
little more than a glance
ls enough to show you
just how small you are
when you re way up high
and you re on your own
in a world like none
that you ve ever known
where the sky is lead
and the earth is stone
you re free to do
whatever pleases you
exploring things you d never dare
 cause you don t care
when suddenly there s
a big  tall  terrible giant at the door
a giant 
a big  tall  terrible lady giant
sweeping the floor
and she gives you food
and she gives you rest
and she draws you close
to her giant breast
and you know things now
that you never knew before
not till the sky
only just when you ve made
a friend and all
and you know she s big
but you don t feel small
someone bigger than her
comes along the hall
to swallow you for lunch
and your heart is lead
and your stomach stone
and you re really scared
being all alone
and it s then that you miss
all the things you ve known
and the world you ve left
and the little you own
the fun is done
you steal what you can and run
and you scramble down
and you look below
and the world you know
begins to grow
the roof  the house
and your mother at the door
the roof
the house
and the world you never
thought to explore
and you think of
all of the things you ve seen
and you wish that
you could live in between
and you re back again
only different than before
after the sky
there are giants in the sky
there are big  tall  terrible
awesome  scary
wonderful giants
in the sky
there s your money  sir 
five gold pieces

ah  good brother 
i was wondering where you had gone 
i ve been searching all night for her

i danced the evening with 
where did she go

like the fine morning mist 
she was lovely 
oh

i m not certain of that 
i must confess  i  too 
have found a lovely maiden 
she lives here  in the woods 
  in the woods 
  yes 
on top of a tall tower
that has no doors or stairs 
where 
two leagues from here  due east 
just beyond the mossy knoll
near the rose thickets 
and how do you manage a visit 
i stand beneath her tower
and i say   rapunzel 
rapunzel  let down your hair to me  
and she lowers the longest 
most beautiful head of hair 
yellow as corn 
which i climb 
rapunzel 
  rapunzel 
  yeah 
what kind of name is that  you jest 
never heard of such a thing 
i speak the truth 
she s as true as your maiden 
a maiden running from a prince 
none would run from us 
yet one has 
did i abuse her 
or show her disdain 
why does she run from me 
if i should lose her
how shall i regain
the heart she has won from me 
agony
beyond power of speech
when the one thing you want
is the only thing out of your reach
high in her tower
she sits by the hour
maintaining her hair
blithe and becoming
and frequently humming
a lighthearted air
agony
far more painful than yours
when you know she would go with you
if there only were doors
agony
oh  the torture they teach
what s as intriguing
or half so fatiguing
as what s out of reach 
am i not sensitive
clever  well mannered  considerate
passionate  charming
as kind as i m handsome
and heir to a throne 
you are everything
maidens could wish for
  then why no 
  do i know 
the girl must be mad
you know nothing of madness
till you re climbing her hair
and you see her up there
as you re nearing her
all the while hearing her
agony
  misery
  woe
though it s different for each
always ten steps behind
always ten feet below
and she s just out of reach
agony
that can cut like a knife
i must have her
to wife
rapunzel  rapunzel 
let down your hair to me 
is that you at this hour  my prince 
yes 
excuse me for this 
oh 
as the baker s wife
bolted from the tower 
the second night
of the festival was thrown into chaos   
stop 
   when cinderella 
once again  ran from the prince 
what are you doing 
so sorry  i need your shoe 
i see her over there 
who is she 
where did she go 
i have no idea  sir 
don t play the fool  woman 
no  i was trying to hold her here for you 
i can capture my own damsel  thank you 
yes  of course 
there s no sign of her  my liege 
well  what are you waiting for 
see if you can find her 
go 
the woods can be a dangerous place 
on 
moo 
i hope that skinny girl
isn t there tomorrow night 
i mean  who was that girl 
please  if you would be so kind 
may i compare this ear of corn
to your hair 
you savage 
mongrel 
he is revolting 
milky white 
  i thought you were returning home 
  it s you 
you ve got the cow 
yes  i ve got the cow 
we ve two of the four 
  no  three 
  two 
three  compare this to your corn 
where did you find it 
just pulled it from a maiden in a tower 
  three 
  three 
and i almost had the fourth 
but she got away 
we ve one entire day left 
surely we can locate the slipper by then 
we 
do you mean you re
going to let me stay with you 
perhaps it will take two of us
to have this child 
you ve changed
you re daring
you re different in the woods
more sure
more sharing
you re getting us through the woods
if you could see
you re not the man who started
and much more open hearted
than i knew you to be
it takes two
i thought one was enough
it s not true
it takes two of us
you came through
when the journey was rough
it took you
it took two of us
it takes care
it takes patience and fear and despair
to change
though you swear
to change
who can tell if you do 
it takes two
you ve changed
you re thriving
there s something about the woods
not just surviving
you re blossoming in the woods
at home i d fear
we d stay the same forever
and then  out here
you re passionate  charming
considerate  clever
it takes one
to begin
but then once you ve begun
it takes two of you
it s no fun
but what needs to be done
you can do
when there s two of you
if i dare
it s because i m becoming
aware of us
as a pair of us
each accepting a share
of what s there
we ve changed
we re strangers
i m meeting you in the woods
who minds what dangers 
i know we ll get past the woods
and once we re past
let s hope the changes last
beyond woods
beyond witches and slippers and hoods
just the two of us
beyond lies
safe at home with our beautiful prize
just the few of us
it takes trust
it takes just a bit more
and we re done
we want four  we had none
we ve got three
we need one
it takes two
stop it  stop my egg 
oh  brilliant  my milky white 
i ve missed you so much 
where did you get this 
from the giant s hen 
a golden egg 
i ve never seen a golden egg before 
and you can have it 
along with the five gold pieces 
what five gold pieces 
now i m taking my cow 
no  i do not wish to sell 
but you took the five gold pieces 
  i didn t take  you gave 
  but you said i could have my cow 
where are the five gold pieces 
i never said you could 
i said you might 
you would take money before a child 
no  no  no  it s not like that 
it wasn t like that 
it s not like i ve
done a deal with him 
  how could you do that 
  it all just happened so fast 
milky white 
milky white is dead 
what 
two midnights gone 
as dawn broke
the baker and his wife
had but one day left
to reverse the witch s curse 
as for rapunzel s prince 
he returned yet again
to the forbidden tower 
no 
bad idea 
are you all right 
yep  yeah 
feel fine  fine 
what did i clearly say 
children must listen
no  please 
what were you not to do 
children must see
no 
and learn
why could you not obey 
children should listen
what have i been to you 
what would you have me be 
handsome like a prince 
but i am old
i am ugly
  i embarrass you
  no 
you are ashamed of me
no 
you are ashamed
you don t understand
i m no longer a child 
i wish to see the world 
don t you know what s out there
in the world 
someone has to shield you
from the world
stay with me
princes wait there in the world  it s true
princes  yes 
but wolves and humans  too
stay at home
i am home
who out there
could love you more than i 
what out there
that i cannot supply 
stay with me
stay with me
the world is dark and wild
stay a child
while you can be a child
with me
i gave you protection
and yet you disobeyed me 
no 
your prince will never
lay eyes on you again 
he will never lay eyes
on anything again 
what did you do to him 
it doesn t matter 
because where you re going
no one will ever see you again 
no  no 
no 
hey  there 
nice cape 
stay away from my cape 
or i ll slash you into a thousand bits 
whoa 
i don t want it 
  where did you get it 
  my granny made it for me
from a wolf that attacked us 
and she gave me this beautiful knife
for protection 
oh  look what i have 
a golden egg 
where did you get that egg 
i stole a hen that lays golden eggs
from the kingdom of the giant 
i don t believe you 
it s true 
and you should see the giant s toy harp 
it plays the most beautiful tunes
without you even having to touch it 
of course it does 
why don t you go up
to the kingdom right now 
bring it back and show it to me 
  i could 
  you could not 
i could 
you could not  mr  liar 
i m not a liar 
i ll get that harp  you ll see 
jack took
the little girl s dare 
and before he knew it
found himself fleeing from a giant 
bring back my harp 
i ll grind your bones 
okay  we don t have much time left 
i don t know where to start 
you can start by buying a new cow
with the money you took from the boy 
right  okay  and where do i buy a cow 
just go to the next village 
i m sure you ll find a cow there 
okay  and what are you going to do 
i m going to get the slipper 
  the yellow slipper 
  the golden slipper 
the golden slipper  that s right 
where are you going to find it 
i ve met a maiden 
these two previous nights 
with golden slippers 
  do you think you can get one 
  i m sure of it 
wait 
why are we always separating 
because we have to 
if we re going to be together 
what 
the entire kingdom shook
when the beanstalk
came crashing down 
killing the giant 
as for the indecisive cinderella 
she fled from the prince 
again 
after her 
he s a very smart prince
he s a prince who prepares
knowing this time
i d run from him
he spread pitch on the stairs
and i m caught unawares
well  it means that he cares
this is more than just malice
better stop and take stock
while you re standing here stuck
on the steps of the palace
all right  what do you want 
have to make a decision
why not stay and be caught 
should i give that a thought 
what would be his response 
but then what if he knew who i am
when i know that i m not
what he thinks that he wants 
or then  what if i am
what a prince would envision 
but then how can you know
who you are till you know
what you want  which i don t 
so then  which do you pick 
where you re safe out of sight
and yourself
but where everything s wrong 
or where everything s right
but you know that you ll never belong 
and whichever you pick
do it quick
 cause you re starting to stick
to the steps of the palace
it s my first big decision
the choice isn t easy to make
to arrive at a ball
ls exciting and all
once you re there  though  it s scary
and it s fun to deceive
when you know you can leave
but you have to be wary
there s a lot that s at stake
but i ve stalled long enough
 cause i m still standing stuck
in the stuff on these steps
better run along home
and avoid the collision
though at home  they don t care
i ll be better off there
where there s nothing to choose
so there s nothing to lose
so i ll pry up my shoes
wait  though  thinking it through
things don t have to collide
i know what my decision is
which is not to decide
i ll just leave him a clue
for example
a shoe
and then see what he ll do
now it s he and not you
who ll be stuck with a shoe
in a stew
in the goo
and i ve learned something  too
something i never knew
on the steps of the palace
with me  quick  men 
she mustn t get away 
the ball is over 
send everyone home 
and the princess 
she won t get far with one shoe 
  don t come any closer to me 
  please  just stop 
just hear me out 
  you have attacked me once before 
  i didn t attack you   
i attacked your shoe 
i need it 
look  i have a magic bean
in exchange for it 
magic bean 
yes 
nonsense 
no 
wait  please 
i haven t much time 
i need that shoe  to have a child 
that makes no sense 
does it make sense
that you re running from a prince 
  stop  you there  stop 
  i must go 
here  take my shoes 
you ll run faster 
here 
  thank you 
  stop 
thank you  thank you 
what is that you have in your hand 
nothing 
it s mine 
lying will cost you your life 
i don t care if it costs me my life 
just get off 
you will pay for this 
no 
sire  i have succeeded
in obtaining the other slipper 
please  kind prince 
let me have the slipper 
and all will come to a happy end 
step back  peon 
do as she says  steward 
we only need one 
  oh 
  oh 
thank you 
we must search immediately
for the maiden who fits this slipper 
tonight 
this very night  on 
forward 
and in her haste 
the baker s wife took no notice
of a second beanstalk
climbing skyward 
let it be known that
his royal highness  the crown prince 
will be visiting every house
in this village tonight 
all young maidens
are hereby commanded
to remain in their home
until visited by the royal guard 
open the gates 
his royal highness approaches 
the prince wishes to meet
all the young maidens of this house 
all young maidens
prepare to meet the prince 
as the prince
anxiously waited 
the stepmother took matters 
and florinda s foot  into her own hands 
  careful  my toe
  darling  i know
  what ll we do 
  it ll have to go
but when you re his bride
you can sit or ride
you ll never need to walk
minus one toe 
florinda mounted the prince s horse
unaware of the blood dripping
from the slipper 
lucinda was next 
why won t it fit 
darling  be still
cut off a bit of the heel and it will
and when you re his wife
you ll have such a life
you ll never need to walk
minus a heel 
lucinda did her best
to swallow the pain 
it s a perfect fit  your highness 
have you no other daughters 
only a little  stunted kitchen wench 
which her late father left behind 
but she cannot present herself 
she is too dirty 
i would recognize
these beautiful eyes anywhere 
you 
you are my true bride 
get down 
get down 
as punishment
for their cruelty 
cinderella s birds swooped down
upon the stepsisters
and blinded them 
as for rapunzel 
the witch had banished her to a swamp
in the darkest depths of the forest 
rapunzel 
rapunzel 
rapunzel 
my darling 
my darling 
i m here 
rapunzel 
rapunzel 
is that you 
i m blind  i can t see 
how could she do this to you 
rapunzel

i can see you 
your hair

come on 
we don t have much time 
  come on 
  i found you 
  you got the cow 
  and you ve got the slipper 
  we ve got all four 
  yes  we ve got all four 
i see a cow 
  i see a slipper

and the cape as red as blood 
  and the hair as yellow as corn

as white as milk to me 
  of course she is 
  of course it is  come on

this cow has been covered with flour 
you didn t get a real white cow 
we had a cow as white as milk

and we thought that you would
prefer a live cow 
of course i would prefer a live cow 
so  show me the dead cow 
i ll bring her back to life 
oh  let s go 
yeah  okay 
it s this way  this way 
jack 
jack 
jack  oh

i ve been worried sick about you 
there s a dead giant in our backyard 
there is 
you know there is 
you could have been crushed 
but  mother  look 
the most beautiful harp 
you ve stolen too much 
you could have been killed
climbing down that plant 
come on  quick 
we buried her under some leaves 
here  here  it s here 
what s happening 
she s going to bring
milky white back to life 
she can do that 
she s a witch  she can do anything 
wow 
stand back 
milky white  you re back 
i can t believe it 
it s almost midnight 
quiet 
feed the objects to the cow 
what 
you heard me 
feed them to the cow 
  really 
  just try it 
fill that with milk 
i ll do it 
she ll only milk for me 
good boy 
squeeze  pal 
you can do it 
it s not working 
what 
wrong ingredients 
forget about your child 
no  no  no 
we followed your instructions 
one  the cow is as white as milk 
  correct 
  yes 
two 
the cape was certainly as red as blood 
  yes 
  three  there was the slipper 
and four  i compared the hair
to this ear of corn 
i pulled this from a maiden in a tower 
you what 
what were you doing there 
nothing  i was passing by 
i touched that hair 
i told you i can t have touched
any of the ingredients 
  oh 
  how are we supposed   
  the corn  the corn 
  what 
you can use the
silky hair off the corn 
  yes  pull it from the ear 
  yes 
feed it to the cow 
quickly 
it s working 
she s milking 
at last 
that was quick 
and it came to pass
all that seemed wrong was now right 
the witch succeeded
in reversing her mother s curse 
cinderella finally stopped
running from her prince 
jack was reunited
with his beloved cow 
and his mother could now dress
in the best a golden egg could buy 
and the baker and his wife
were proud parents
of a strapping baby boy 
thanks for the slipper 
attention 
let us cheer the newlyweds
as they embark   
and so 
with the kingdom filled with joy 
those who deserved to
were destined to live happily ever

jack 
jack 
the royal prince
wishes to address his loyal subjects

there is no need for worry 
it was just an earthquake
in a far quadrant of our kingdom 
nothing to fear at all 
i will personally investigate
the disturbance 
now everyone  back to your villages
and on with your lives 
but as they made
their way back into the woods 
their familiar paths
were nowhere to be found 
and their lives were about
to take an unexpected turn 
here  here  watch out

everything s so different 
oh  look

well  you needn t hold him
as though he was so fragile 
he doesn t want me 
he wants his mother 
i can t take care

i will take care of
him when he s older 
mind your head

who might that be 
it s the steward
and the royal family

jack  oh

we had no food to eat 
so he sold his cow
in exchange for some magic beans 
the boy 
i want the boy 
you leave my boy alone 
i m waiting 
be quiet  woman 
or you ll get us all killed 
you must be quiet 
flouncing through our kingdom
in your great big clodhoppers   
let us not anger the giant 
   destroying everything in your path 
  let s not anger the giant 
  you re just a big bully 
i m gonna get my boy and hide him
so you ll never find him 
  you ll never  never  ever

i didn t mean to hurt her 
i was just thinking of the greater good 
if we re going to get through this
we re going to do it
if we all stick together 
some people are cut out to battle giants 
others are not 
i don t have the constitution 
and as long as i can be of no help 
i m going to hide 
let s go 
everything will work
out fine in the end 
not always 
come along 
i don t know
where they think they re going 
the giant s already destroyed
the entire village 
only thing left of my garden
are these beans 
what are we going to do now 
we have no choice 
find the boy
and give her what she wants 
but if we do  she ll kill jack 
and if we don t 
she ll kill half the kingdom 
we mustn t let her get jack 
we re not going to 
it s okay

and locked me in a tower 
to protect you 
and banished me to an island
in the middle of a swamp 
i was just trying to be a good mother 
rapunzel  no 
you will never be safe with him 
  take me away from here 
  no 
don t you understand 
i never want to see you again 
ever 
but  rapunzel  the giant 
no matter what you say
children won t listen
no matter what you know
children refuse
to learn
guide them along the way
still they don t listen
children can only grow
from something you love
to something you lose
jack

hello  your royal highness 
well  hello 
hello  again 
we ve met before  actually 
yes  of course 
yes 
you must be here to slay the giant 
  the giant 
  yes 
haven t you heard 
we have a giant in our midst 
not an earthquake 
of course 
the giant 
it s a lady giant 
which is very unusual 
i should think so 
and why are you
alone in the woods 
um   
well  i came here with my husband 
and we were   
well  you see  it s a long story 
and he would let you roam alone
in the woods 
well  no  actually 
it was my choice 
how brave 
brave 
yes 
anything can happen
in the woods
may i kiss you 
any moment we could be crushed
  um   
  don t feel rushed
this is ridiculous
what am i doing here 
i m in the wrong story
wait  wait  wait  we can t do this 
you have a princess 
  well  yes  i do 
  and i have a baker 
of course 
you re right 
how foolish 
foolishness can happen in the woods
  once again  please
  um   
let your hesitations be hushed
any moment  big or small
ls a moment  after all
seize the moment  skies may fall
any moment
but this is not right 
right and wrong don t matter
in the woods
only feelings
let us meet the moment unblushed
life is often so unpleasant
you must know that  as a peasant
best to take the moment present
as a present for the moment
476  477 
478  479  480 
481  482  483   
excuse me  ma am 
you haven t seen a boy anywhere 
have you 
he s about so high 
i m sorry  may i be of some service 
the tree has fallen 
mother s grave  destroyed 
i m sorry 
i shouldn t complain 
i m sure others have suffered worse
after the earthquake 
no  no  this isn t an earthquake 
there s a giant terrorizing the kingdom 
then i m sure the prince will see to it
that the giant is rid from our land 
the prince 
no doubt he s off somewhere
seducing some young maiden 
what 
you look like the princess  but dirty 
oh  my  you are the   
i didn t recognize you  honestly 
no  no  please  get up 
i m not a princess here 
i had to disguise myself 
i m not permitted to leave
the palace unescorted 
if you d like  you could come with me 
i mean  you ll be safe in our company 
thank you 
it s this way 
my wife is somewhere 
we decided to walk 500 paces
in one direction   
  i must leave you 
  oh 
now i must go
off to slay a giant 
i shall not forget you 
how brave you are
to be alone in the woods 
and how alive you ve made me feel 
what was that 
was that me 
was that him 
did a prince really kiss me 
and kiss me 
and kiss me 
and did i kiss him back 
was it wrong 
am i mad 
is that all 
does he miss me 
was he suddenly
getting bored with me 
wake up  stop dreaming
stop prancing about the woods
it s not beseeming
what is it about the woods 
back to life  back to sense
back to child  back to husband
no one lives in the woods
there are vows  there are ties
there are needs  there are standards
there are shouldn ts and shoulds
why not both instead 
there s the answer  if you re clever
have a child for warmth
and a baker for bread
and a prince for whatever
never
it s these woods
face the facts  find the boy
join the group  stop the giant
just get out of these woods
was that him  yes  it was
was that me  no  it wasn t
just a trick of the woods
just a moment
one peculiar  passing moment
must it all be either less or more 
either plain or grand 
is it always  or  
is it never  and  
that s what woods are for
for those moments in the woods
oh  if life were made of moments
even now and then a bad one
but if life were only moments
then you d never know you had one
first a witch  then a child
then a prince  then a moment
who can live in the woods 
and to get what you wish
only just for a moment
these are dangerous woods
let the moment go
don t forget it for a moment  though
just remembering you ve had an  and 
when you re back to  or 
makes the  or  mean more
than it did before
now i understand
and it s time to leave the woods
which way was it 
172 173 174 175   
172 173 174   
she should be back by now 
she wouldn t get lost 
i m sure she ll return soon 
i m going to go and look for her 
will you 
  look who i found 
  you re hurting me 
let go of him 
i ll let go of him
when i give him to the giant 
leave him alone 
keep away from him 
stop  stop 
i said stop 
where did you find this 
i m sorry  sir 
it s my wife s 
i m sorry  i came upon her 
she was at the bottom of a cliff 
what are you saying 
how awful 
no 
no 
this is all my fault 
i shouldn t have let
her wander off alone 
i should have
made her stay with me 
remorse will get you nowhere 
  my wife is dead 
  wake up 
when you re dead  you re dead 
it s time we get this boy to the giant
before we re all dead 
keep away from him 
this is no time
to be soft hearted 
he s going to the giant
and i m taking him 
yes  yes  he s the one to blame 
it s because of you there s a giant
in our midst  and my wife is dead 
but it isn t my fault
i was given those beans
you persuaded me to trade away
my cow for beans
and without those beans
there d have been no stalk
to get up to the giants
in the first place
wait a minute
magic beans
for a cow so old
that you had to tell a lie to sell it
which you told
were they worthless beans 
were they oversold 
oh  and tell us who persuaded you
to steal that gold
  see  it s your fault
  no 
  yes  it s your fault
  no 
  yes  it is
  it s not 
  it s true
  wait a minute though
i only stole the gold to get my cow back
from you
so it s your fault
  yes 
  no  it isn t
i d have kept those beans
but our house was cursed
she made us get a cow
to get the curse reversed
it s his father s fault
that the curse got placed
and the place got cursed
in the first place
  oh  then it s his fault
  so
  it was his fault
  no 
yes  it is  it s his
  i guess
wait a minute though
i chopped down the beanstalk
right  that s clear
but without any beanstalk
then what s queer
ls how did the second giant
get down here
in the first place
second place 
  yes 
  how 
well  who had the other bean 
  the other bean 
  the other bean 
  you pocketed the other bean
  i didn t  yes  i did
so it s your fault
no  it isn t
 cause i gave it to my wife
  so it s her fault
  no  it isn t
  then whose is it 
  wait a minute
she exchanged that bean
to obtain your shoe
so the one who knows what happened
to the bean is you
you mean that old bean
that your wife    oh  dear
but i never knew and so i threw   
well  don t look here
  so it s your fault
  but   
  see  it s her fault
  but   
and it isn t mine at all
but what 
well  if you hadn t gone
back up again
we were needy
you were greedy
did you need that hen 
but i got it for my mother
so it s her fault then
yes  and what about the harp
in the third place 
the harp  yes
  she went and dared me to
  i dared you to 
  she said that i was scared
  me 
  so she dared me
  no  i didn t
so it s your fault
  wait a minute
  if you hadn t dared him to
and you had left the harp alone
if you hadn t thrown away the bean
in the first place
if she hadn t raised them
in the first place
if you hadn t raised them
in the first place
  you raised the beans in the first place
  it s your fault
you re responsible
you re the one to blame
it s your fault
it s the last midnight
it s the last wish
it s the last midnight
soon it will be boom
squish
told a little lie
stole a little gold
broke a little vow
did you 
had to get your prince
had to get your cow
had to get your wish
doesn t matter how
anyway  it doesn t matter now
it s the last midnight
it s the boom
splat
nothing but a vast midnight
everybody smashed flat
nothing we can do
not exactly true
we could always give her the boy
no  of course
what really matters is the blame
someone you can blame
fine  if that s the thing you enjoy
placing the blame
if that s the aim
give me the blame
just give me the boy
  no 
  no 
no 
you re so nice
you re not good
you re not bad
you re just nice
i m not good
i m not nice
i m just right
i m the witch
you re the world
i m the hitch
i m what no one believes
i m the witch
you re all liars and thieves
like his father
like his son will be  too
oh  why bother 
you ll just do what you do
it s the last midnight
so goodbye  all
coming at you fast
midnight
soon you ll see the sky fall
here  you want a bean 
have another bean
beans were made for making you rich
plant them and they soar
here  you want some more 
listen to the roar
giants by the score
oh well  you can blame another witch
it s the last midnight
it s the last verse
now  before it s past midnight
i m leaving you my last curse
i m leaving you alone
you can tend the garden  it s yours
separate and alone
everybody down on all fours
all right  mother  when 
lost the beans again
punish me the way you did then
give me claws and a hunch
just away from this bunch
and the gloom
and the doom
and the boom
crunch 
maybe i shouldn t have
stolen from the giant 
maybe i shouldn t have
strayed from the path 
maybe i shouldn t have
attended the ball 
yeah  maybe you shouldn t have 
  where are you going 
  away from here 
but you said we had to find our way
out of this together 
it doesn t matter if we re together
or we re apart 
we need your help 
you don t understand 
i depended on my wife for everything 
she was the one who helped 
you would leave your child 
he ll be happier in the arms
of a princess 
but wait 
what are you doing here 
son   
i don t want to talk to you 
it s because of you all of this happened 
  go away 
  i m sorry  i did a foolish thing 
why would you do that 
why did you take the witch s beans 
they were there
and i wanted them 
i didn t think 
i was being careless 
  selfish 
  yes 
you stole and you got caught 
and you did what you do 
you just ran away 
when your mother died  i was   
i hated myself 
i ran away from my guilt and my shame 
and your son 
yes  my son  and i m sorry for that 
  then what do you want 
  aren t you making the same mistake 
aren t you running away 
be better than me 
son 
do better 
see  so this is you 
and you re going to come over here 
if there were just some way
we could surprise the giant 
she s too tall to surprise 
so  that s why i m going to
be behind here 
yeah  and then you can come here 
climb on top   
i knew you wouldn t give up 
he wouldn t leave his baby 
it looked like he was going to 
give me my son 
hey 
what are we
gonna do now 
we need to rid this kingdom
of the giant together 
she ll be back soon  so here s the plan 
we re going to feed jack to the giant 
  what 
  no 
  we re going to use you as bait 
  bait 
to lure the giant to the tar pit 
oh 
the birds can help 
good friends  we need your help
now more than ever 
what of the prince 
that doesn t matter now 
what s important is that
we find a way to defeat the giant 
yes 
thank you  birds 
you can talk to birds 
the birds will do their part 
  okay  we don t have much time 
  i m excited 
  first  we ll need a weapon 
  i wish i had my sling 
we can make some 
your father is being very brave 
we re going to
be very brave too 
are you all right  miss 
the giant went in that direction 
my darling 
oh  my darling 
i did not recognize you 
what are you doing here 
and with a child 
you must get back
to the castle at once 
there is a giant on the loose 
i m well aware of that 
my love  what is it 
maybe i m not your only love 
i love you  truly  i do 
if you love me  why did you stray 
uh   
i thought that if you were mine 
i would never wish for more 
if this is how you
behave as a prince 
what kind of king will you be 
i was raised to be charming  not sincere 
i think you should go 
is that what you really wish 
my father s house was a nightmare 
your house a dream 
now i want something in between 
i shall always love the maiden
who ran away 
and i the faraway prince 
careful 
not so fast 
don t worry 
this is easier than the beanstalk 
they re up in the tree 
over there 
we made slings out of my cape 
i wanted to climb the tree too 
well  i m glad you re here to help me 
what s wrong 
i think my granny and my mother
would be upset with me 
why 
they said to always make them proud 
and here i am  about to kill somebody 
not somebody 
a giant who s done a lot of harm 
but a giant is a person 
aren t we to show forgiveness 
mother cannot guide you
now you re on your own
only me beside you
still you re not alone
no one is alone  truly
no one is alone
i wish   
i know 
wait until my mother hears
i ve slain the giant 
jack 
there s something you need to know 
it s about your mother 
what 
she didn t make it 
  was she killed by the giant 
  no 
it wasn t like that 
she was fighting with the giant 
she was trying to protect you 
and she was pushed by the steward 
and she fell 
  the steward will pay for this 
  no  jack 
after we slay the giant 
i will slay him 
you ll do nothing of the kind 
what he did was wrong 
he should be punished 
it s not as easy as that 
mother isn t here now
wrong things  right things
who knows what she d say 
who can say what s true 
nothing s quite so clear now
do things  fight things
feel you ve lost your way 
you decide
but you are not alone
believe me
no one is alone
no one is alone
believe me
truly
people make mistakes
fathers
mothers
people make mistakes
holding to their own
thinking they re alone
honor their mistakes
fight for their mistakes
everybody makes
one another s terrible mistakes
witches can be right
giants can be good
you decide what s right
you decide what s good
just remember
just remember
someone is on your side
our side
our side
someone else is not
while we re seeing our side
  our side
  our side
maybe we forgot
they are not alone
no one is alone
someone is on your side
no one is alo   
go  jack 
  be careful 
  yeah 
here she comes 
where is the boy 
we have him 
where 
he s hiding in that tree 
here i am

good birds 
she does not look happy 
ooh

jack  i m here 
  are you all right 
  yeah 
  okay 
  yeah 
you okay 
you all right 
  yeah 
  all right  yeah 
we did it 
we did it 
and now we can return home 
what home 
i have no one to take care of me 
and we have nowhere to go 
so we ll move in with you 
well  it s   
of course 
of course you can come
and stay with me 
and you can come too 
  only if you want to 
  i ll gladly help you with your house 
there are times
i actually enjoy cleaning 
here 
what s this 
come on  now 
i know 
i know  you miss your mother 
i miss her too 
please 
maybe i just wasn t
meant to have children 
don t say that 
of course you were
meant to have children 
but how can i go about being a father
when i had no father to show me 
just calm the child
yes  calm the child
look  tell him the story
of how it all happened
be father and mother
you ll know what to do
alone 
sometimes people leave you
halfway through the wood
do not let it grieve you
no one leaves for good
you are not alone
no one is alone
hold him to the light now
let him see the glow
things will be all right now
tell him what you know
once upon a time  in a far off kingdom 
there lay a small village
at the edge of the woods 
careful the things you say
  and in this village   
  children will listen
   there lived a young maiden   
  careful the things you do
     a carefree young lad   
children will see
   and a childless baker   
and learn
   with his wife 
guide them along the way
children will glisten
children will look to you
for which way to turn
to learn what to be
careful before you say
 listen to me 
children will listen
careful the wish you make
wishes are children
careful the path they take
wishes come true
not free
careful the spell you cast
not just on children
sometimes the spell may last
past what you can see
and turn against you
careful the tale you tell
that is the spell
children will listen
though it s fearful
though it s deep  though it s dark
and though you may lose the path
though you may encounter wolves
you can t just act
you have to listen
you can t just act
you have to think
there are always wolves
there are always spells
there are always beans
or a giant dwells  and so
into the woods you go again
you have to every now and then
into the woods  no telling when
be ready for the journey
into the woods  but not too fast
for what you wish  you lose at last
into the woods  but mind the past
into the woods  but mind the future
into the woods  but not to stray
or tempt the wolf
or steal from the giant
the way is dark
the light is dim
but now there s you  me  her  and him
the chances look small
the choices look grim
but everything you learn there
will help when you return there
the light is getting dimmer
i think i see a glimmer
into the woods you have to grope
but that s the way you learn to cope
into the woods to find this hope
of getting through the journey
into the woods  each time you go
there s more to learn of what you know
into the woods  but not too slow
into the woods  it s nearing midnight
into the woods to mind the wolf
to heed the witch
to honor the giant
to mind  to heed  to find  to think
