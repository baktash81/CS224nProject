we got something from your gun
and this is from the first weapon
ganz used
wait a minute i dont get this

point blank range
right between the eyes
found him on a park bench
you know there are some
very bad people out there in the world
yeah look at it this way ruth
if there werent
what the hell would we have to do huh
so anyway i got there
he took me down
he started watching television
and then you sensational people
started banging on the door
thats it
except that i think hes gonna
give you guys a hard time

speedloader kehoe
i want to be left alone on this one
al was killed with my gun
jack theres an official
department policy about cop killings
now cop killers represent
a special priority
because any man crazy enough
to kill a cop
is a greater threat
to an unarmed civilian
right
in other words
we cant seem like
were in the revenge business
and we all know
the truths a little different
yeah
anythings bothering you
besides losing your gun
yeah it bothers me
when cops get killed
i dont like that
then you might be
a little more of a team player
and a little less of a hot dog on this one
hot doggings been
working real well so far
besides i got a lead
okay you got to do things
your own way
fine
now you nail this guy
and make us all look good
but you better watch your ass
because everybodys watching
on this one
if you screw up i can promise you
youre going down
