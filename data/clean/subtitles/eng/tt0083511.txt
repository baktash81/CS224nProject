  cates 
  yeah 
got a print from the hotel room  the
guy s real name is ganz  albert ganz 
he headed from back east  but he
worked out here a few years back 
armed robbery 
broke out of prison a couple of days ago
and capped a couple of the guards 
a real animal  wait till you see this 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
did he give you a return match 
he wasn t interested 
maybe he didn t
like the merchandise  huh 
  fuck you 
  i ll take a rain check on that  huh 
  this ll interest you  jack 
  yeah  what do you got 
we got something from your gun 
and this is from the first weapon
ganz used 
wait a minute  i don t get this 
here  it s a perfect match from
the markings from the first gun he used 
but it s not from the walden hotel 
fired six hours earlier 
point blank range 
right between the eyes 
found him on a park bench 
you know  there are some
very bad people out there in the world 
yeah  look at it this way  ruth 
if there weren t 
what the hell would we have to do  huh 
so anyway  i got there 
he took me down 
he started watching television 
and then you sensational people
started banging on the door 
that s it 
except that i think he s gonna
give you guys a hard time 
what makes you think so 
i just think he likes shooting cops
a lot more than getting laid 
  jack  check it out 
  what do you got 
the stuff from his hotel 
every last bit of it 
  the big guy s room was empty 
  all right  let s go through it 
a speedloader

good  good 
  get in here  cates 
  yeah  yeah  yeah 
speedloader  kehoe 
i want to be left alone on this one 
al was killed with my gun 
jack  there s an official
department policy about cop killings 
now  cop killers represent
a special priority 
because any man crazy enough
to kill a cop
is a greater threat
to an unarmed civilian 
  right 
  in other words 
we can t seem like
we re in the revenge business 
and we all know
the truth s a little different 
yeah 
anything s bothering you
besides losing your gun 
yeah  it bothers me
when cops get killed 
i don t like that 
then you might be
a little more of a team player
and a little less of a hot dog on this one 
hot dogging s been
working real well so far 
besides  i got a lead 
okay  you got to do things
your own way 
fine 
now  you nail this guy
and make us all look good 
but you better watch your ass 
because everybody s watching
on this one 
if you screw up  i can promise you 
you re going down 
boy  you know how to send a guy out
with a real great attitude  boss
