in a secret location  architects 
scientists and engineers met   
and concluded that there was
only one hope for our future 
to build an underground city   
designed to keep its citizens
protected for generations to come 
secure the box 
set it for
200 years 
we ll keep them in the city for 200 years 
you re certain
that ll be long enough 
none of us can be certain of anything 
we can hope 
growing up with no knowledge
of a world outside   
future generations will be spared sorrow
for what they ve lost 
for the good of all mankind 
the box was entrusted to the first mayor   
who was to pass it on
to her successor 
as the years counted down   
the box passed from mayor to mayor 
none knew what secrets it held   
only that it would open
when it was needed most 
but fate ran another course   
and the chain was broken 
the box was tucked away
and forgotten   
  and as the city grew old and began to crumble   
the box quietly clicked open 
  dad  do you hear that 
  uh  hurry up  you don t wanna be late

come on 
i gotta show you something 
what are we doing here 
the builders left us this book 
we learned about it in history

n no one but the mayor s supposed to 
the builders wrote these instructions 
it s exactly the same 
come on 
there s something i have to show you 
  wow 
  what do you think 
  i think it s instructions 
  yeah 
what i don t understand is 
why would they have it in a circle 
  i mean  i know it must be important 
  add a  t  
  what 
  add a  t  
e x i t  exit 
what if there s an exit from ember 
i don t think
we re supposed to be down here 
this tunnel was erased from sul s map 
it dead ends in a locked room 
this could be it 
  that was just the last time 
  come on 
  the time before that i 
  shh 
you re gonna get us caught

i have no idea

moles need to eat all the time
just to stay alive 
probably just as hungry as we are 
did you see those storerooms 
they re completely empty 
we re gonna run out of food 
it doesn t matter anyway 
the generator won t last 
and pretty soon
it ll be black for good 
 mayfleet   that s my name 
the man who wore that helmet
before me drowned 
drowned 
he worked here 
there s no water
but the irrigation pipes 
how could he have drowned 
i miss him so much 
mom too 
how am i ever gonna figure out
what this is all about 
it s all these zeros 
that s what scares me the most 
what would count down to nothing 
  it sounds like doomsday 
  oh  shh 
please  honey 
don t do anything foolish 
i couldn t bear to lose you too 
how did he die  clary 
oh 
did he really drown 
your father thought
it was doomsday too 
he believed there was a way
to get out of ember 
i couldn t dissuade him 
i said it was our duty to stay here
and fix our problems   
that it s illegal to venture out
into the unknown 
why is it illegal 
your father said 
 the river runs in one direction   
so it must come from someplace
and go to someplace    
but he must ve hit it too early or something 
i  i don t know 
the tunnel flooded  and 
and my dad died 
he was by himself 
everyone else got out
before it collapsed 
i was  i was considering
taking the box to the mayor 
yes  do that 
do that instead  please 
let him handle the situation 
these are trying and troubled times 
our problems are grave 
we need answers 
but beyond answers 
more important than answers 
we need solutions 
  mm hmm 
  yeah 
and in order to find those solutions   
i propose we launch
a thorough investigation 
yes  yes 
i hereby declare
the creation of a task force   
to investigate the blackouts 
do i have volunteers 
today we  the people   
stand united against the darkness

wait 
oh  happy great day of singing 
young lady 
i need to speak to you in private 
very well then 
what i need to tell you is secret
and really important 
  what is it 
  the mayor  he s got a bunker in the pipeworks 
it s filled with food 
the shortages aren t as bad
as everyone thinks 
you mean the mayor is stealing 
looper  who works in the storerooms 
is helping him 
well  this is shocking 
shocking  i m shocked 
um  we have to report this 
come with me 
well done  lina mayfleet 
once you arrest him  doon and i can show you where the room is  
wait  where are we going 
i beg your pardon  your honor 
you remember lina mayfleet 
she wants to accuse you 
accuse me of what 
of stealing food
from the people of ember 
i love my city and everyone in it 
and i would never think
to do such a thing 
we saw your room 
we saw you in it 
   we  
  she and her friend  doon harrow 
what s that box 
hmm 
it s mine 
it s unusual looking 
where d you get that 
you re related to one of the mayors 
yes  uh  he was the seventh mayor 
a lot of things got lost
when the seventh mayor passed 
may i look at that box  lina 
  why 
  what s inside the box  lina 
i imagine it s official
mayor related business 
box  give it to me 
  it s not yours

y you have to talk louder 
  doon harrow 
  doon harro  no  loris 
we re looking for doon harrow 
he s charged with treason against the city 
that s terrible 
if it s true  he s no son of mine 
treason is the worst offense
anyone could possibly commit 
builders were wise when they said 
 if you have proof  you have to pursue it 
there s more to a bottle cap than
keeping liquid from leaking out of glass   
  get him 
  uh  we ll go this way 
doon  the guards are here 
you traitor 
  in here  follow him 
  they re comin  to get you 
the keypad is somewhere 
what s he doin  
  just one second 
  he s crazy 
  is this the way to your apartment 
  apparently not 
upstairs 
  they re after me 
  who 
  guards 
  why 
doon and i  we  quick 
what is this all about 
we ll be late for the great day of singing 
well  excuse me  ma am 
i m  i m looking for lina mayfleet 
well  she s not here  she s probably
already in harken square 
okay  okay  well  i guess
i ll just have a look for myself 
oh  excuse me 
beg your pardon  so sorry 
you know  the mayor did
ask for her specifically 
the greenhouse  uh  she was meeting
a friend at the greenhouse 
does that help 
careful 
that s food you re destroying 
our food 
psst 
a warning 
if i discover you were helping  harboring
or otherwise assisting those kids 
why would i do that 
i have information
they were coming this way 
who provided you
with that information 
that s confidential 
all i need for you to understand is this 
if you re involved  you ll regret it 
  anything you hear  anything you see   
you tell me 
otherwise 
there will be consequences 
should anything happen in the future
that you hear of or see   
i ll expect to be informed 
i don t need to tell you
that i have the mayor s ear 
hmm 
okay 
leave two guards behind 
we ve gotta find a way out of here 
now 
what is this 
my dad made this 
it doesn t look very safe 
that s my dad 
everything he makes looks like this 
what do you mean  your dad 
barrow  his voice is on
your answering machine 
but your dad s name is loris 
barrow harrow  it s his nickname

tied their hope to a rock   
and tossed it down toward the city 
the rock could ve ended up on a roof 
or kicked into a gutter

and the message found its way 
now the path was clear for all 
all of us who kept
the flame of ember burning
