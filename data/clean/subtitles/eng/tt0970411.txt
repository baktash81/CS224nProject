in a secret location architects
scientists and engineers met
and concluded that there was
only one hope for our future
to build an underground city
designed to keep its citizens
protected for generations to come
secure the box
set it for
200 years
well keep them in the city for 200 years
youre certain
thatll be long enough
none of us can be certain of anything
we can hope
growing up with no knowledge
of a world outside
future generations will be spared sorrow
for what theyve lost
for the good of all mankind
the box was entrusted to the first mayor
who was to pass it on
to her successor
as the years counted down
the box passed from mayor to mayor
none knew what secrets it held
only that it would open
when it was needed most
but fate ran another course
and the chain was broken
the box was tucked away
and forgotten
and as the city grew old and began to crumble
the box quietly clicked open
dad do you hear that
uh hurry up you dont wanna be late
i am hurrying
im proud of you son
todays a big day

nno one but the mayors supposed to
the builders wrote these instructions
its exactly the same
come on
theres something i have to show you
wow
what do you think
i think its instructions
yeah
what i dont understand is
why would they have it in a circle
i mean i know it must be important
add a t
what
add a t
exit exit
what if theres an exit from ember
i dont think
were supposed to be down here
this tunnel was erased from suls map
it deadends in a locked room

i have no idea
run
lina up here

moles need to eat all the time
just to stay alive
probably just as hungry as we are
did you see those storerooms
theyre completely empty
were gonna run out of food
it doesnt matter anyway
the generator wont last
and pretty soon
itll be black for good
mayfleet thats my name
the man who wore that helmet
before me drowned
drowned
he worked here
theres no water
but the irrigation pipes
how could he have drowned
i miss him so much
mom too
how am i ever gonna figure out
what this is all about
its all these zeros
thats what scares me the most
what would count down to nothing
it sounds like doomsday
oh shh
please honey
dont do anything foolish
i couldnt bear to lose you too
how did he die clary
oh
did he really drown
your father thought
it was doomsday too
he believed there was a way
to get out of ember
i couldnt dissuade him
i said it was our duty to stay here
and fix our problems
that its illegal to venture out
into the unknown
why is it illegal
your father said
the river runs in one direction
so it must come from someplace
and go to someplace
but he mustve hit it too early or something
i i dont know
the tunnel flooded and
and my dad died
he was by himself
everyone else got out
before it collapsed
i was i was considering
taking the box to the mayor
yes do that
do that instead please
let him handle the situation
these are trying and troubled times
our problems are grave
we need answers
but beyond answers
more important than answers
we need solutions
mmhmm
yeah
and in order to find those solutions
i propose we launch
a thorough investigation
yes yes
i hereby declare
the creation of a task force
to investigate the blackouts
do i have volunteers
today we the people
stand united against the darkness

young lady
i need to speak to you in private
very well then
what i need to tell you is secret
and really important
what is it
the mayor hes got a bunker in the pipeworks
its filled with food
the shortages arent as bad
as everyone thinks
you mean the mayor is stealing
looper who works in the storerooms
is helping him
well this is shocking
shocking im shocked
um we have to report this
come with me
well done lina mayfleet
once you arrest him doon and i can show you where the room is
wait where are we going
i beg your pardon your honor
you remember lina mayfleet
she wants to accuse you

doon harrow
doon harro no loris

hes charged with treason against the city
thats terrible
if its true hes no son of mine
treason is the worst offense
anyone could possibly commit
builders were wise when they said
if you have proof you have to pursue it
theres more to a bottle cap than
keeping liquid from leaking out of glass
get him
uh well go this way
doon the guards are here
you traitor
in here follow him
theyre comin to get you
the keypad is somewhere

ask for her specifically
the greenhouse uh she was meeting
a friend at the greenhouse

a warning
if i discover you were helping harboring
or otherwise assisting those kids
why would i do that
i have information
they were coming this way
who provided you
with that information
thats confidential
all i need for you to understand is this
if youre involved youll regret it
anything you hear anything you see
you tell me
otherwise
there will be consequences
should anything happen in the future
that you hear of or see
ill expect to be informed
i dont need to tell you
that i have the mayors ear
hmm
okay
leave two guards behind
weve gotta find a way out of here
now
what is this
my dad made this
it doesnt look very safe
thats my dad
everything he makes looks like this
what do you mean your dad
barrow his voice is on
your answering machine
but your dads name is loris
barrow harrow its his nickname
after some wheelbarrow he used to push around

tied their hope to a rock
and tossed it down toward the city
the rock couldve ended up on a roof
or kicked into a gutter
but fate ran another course
and the message found its way
now the path was clear for all
all of us who kept
the flame of ember burning
