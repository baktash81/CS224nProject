charles 
i knew i was made
for better things 
i had a calling 
i just didn t know
what as 
weren t singing 
can t fucking act 
kind of running out
of choices really 
aren t we 
  baby  it s slow  
  when the lights go low  
  there s no help  no     
  keys jangling  
  baby  it s slow  
  when the lights go low  
  there s no help  no  
  he s drilling through  
  the spiritus sanctus tonight  
  through the dark hip falls  
  screaming  
  oh  you mambos kill me  
  and kill me and kill me  
  if i jerk the handle  
  you ll die
in your dreams  
  if i jerk the handle  
  jerk the handle  
  you ll thrill me  
  and thrill me  
  and thrill me   
  laughs  
charles 
right  how else can i explain it 
  baby cooing  
there was nothing wonky
about my upbringing 
my parents were decent 
respectable and upstanding
members of society 
i went to school 
i kept my head down 
so like most kids 
i got into trouble 
you bastard 
i liked it 
  children shouting  
  teacher whimpering  
  doorbell rings  
oh  michael 
mrs  peterson  i really must
talk to you about michael 
but i wasn t bad 
i wasn t bad bad 
and i still have my principles 
i took the first job
i could get my hands on 
bring the fries  peterson 
i suppose the crumpet
wasn t bad 
  doorbell rings  
mrs  peterson 
we d like to have
a word with your son 
michael 
michael peterson 
right 
yeah  before i forget 
i did come into this world
as michael peterson 
but i ll go out
with my fighting name   
charlie bronson 
which is my alter ego 
  screaming  
1974   
tough time
to be young in england 
not a lot of opportunity around 
still  life moves on 
irene and i got hitched 
    baby crying  
  it was all right 
we didn t have it bad
for a couple from the chippy 
but they don t give you
a star on the walk of fame
for  not bad   do they 
  crying  
  metal clangs  
michael  what is that noise 
for god s sakes 
so this is the post office
i did over 
this is what i got away with 
  coins rattling  
and this is what they gave me 
seven years 
mother 
don t worry  son 
you won t do the seven 
you ll be out in four 
  door locks  
  crying  
    laughing  
    audience laughing  
i had you going  didn t i 
huh 
go on 
i had you going 
i ve always fancied myself
as a bit of a comedian 
but seven years
is a long time 
  laughs  
now i m not gonna
stand here  right  and tell you   
tell you that prison
is  not bad  
no  that would be
misrepresenting myself 
and i think enough of that
has been done already 
don t you 
no 
you see  i didn t see
a cell  a cage
or a box 
to me  it was a hotel room 
    chains clanging  
    indistinct screaming  
don t get me wrong 
for most people 
prison is tough 
a monotonous nightmare 
24 hours a day 
seven days a week 
365 days a year
of pure  unadulterated 
living  breathing hell 
  man wailing  
charles 
but for me 
prison was finally a place
where i could sharpen my tools 
hone my skills 
it s like a battleground 
isn t it 
it was an opportunity
and a place where soon
every native
was gonna know my name 
what s the matter  charlie 
do you want me to take
you through it again 
no  we don t do work
in long term prisons 
it s vocational training
so you can get a job when  
fuck off 
  sewing machines rattling  
what s the problem  peterson 
problem 
i said  what s the problem 
peterson 
i don t know 
i don t have a problem 
  screaming  
  prisoners cheering  
  cheering  
keep your chin up  mate 
  door locks  
  sighs  
oh  crikey 
  whistling  
would you like
a cup of tea  mate 
thanks  mickey 
love one 
  milk and sugar 
  please 
  how many sugars 
  two 
one  two 
  picture you
upon my knee  
  tea for two  
  and two for tea  
  just me for you  
  and you for me  
  alone   
and would you like
a cup of tea too  mate 
nothing closer to my heart
than a good cup
of british char 
  milk and sugar 
  no  i like it dark 
oh 
that s an impressive set
of guns you have there 
you must be handy in a brawl 
bam bam 
knockout  ding ding 
very nice 
  humming  
  charles laughing  
but time stops for no man 
ladies and germs 
and my time was coming up 
parole 
and just when i was about
to make a name to be reckoned with 
    crowd groans  
  man  oh  yeah  as what 
as what 
you don t wanna be trapped
inside with me  sunshine 
inside  i m someone
nobody wants to fuck with 
do you understand 
i am charlie bronson 
i am britain s
most violent prisoner 
charles 
prison was 
honestly  brilliant 
i liked it personally 
fuck that  i loved it 
it was exciting 
it was on the edge 
it was madness as its very best 
    clothes ripping  
    glass shatters  
  knives clanging  
  horse whinnies  
the problem is
once you get comfortable 
or sometimes even before 
they ghost you again
and again 
moving you from prison
to prison to prison 
and i fucking hate that 
parkhurst  god bless that place 
the accommodation
was more than worthy
of my royal self 
your own bed 
toilet  a sink 
the food was
of exceptional standard 
yes  parkhurst was a corker 
and hull prison 
well  what can i say 
well worth a visit 
scrubs not my
favorite place to visit 
but the staff are ready
to make your stay
as memorable as possible 
we had a laugh 
how we laughed 
  door locks  
  please release me  
  let me go  
   cause i don t love you  
  anymore   
charles 
in the end  i got it wrong 
quite seriously wrong  actually 
they sent me here 
the funny farm 
  radio playing softly  
  man grunting  
  patients clamoring  
where are we going 
oh  what have you got for me

  soft music playing  
  when i look back
upon my life  
  it s always
with a sense of shame  
  i ve always been
the one to blame  
  for everything i long to do  
  no matter when
or where or who  
  has one thing
in common too  
  it s a it s a 
it s a     
  it s a sin  
  it s a sin  
  everything i ve ever done 
everything i ever do  
  every place
i ve ever been  
  everywhere
i m going to  
  it s a sin  
  at school
they taught me how to be  
  so pure in thought  
  and word and deed  
  they didn t
quite succeed  
  for everything i long to do  
  no matter when
or where or who  
  has one thing
in common too  
  it s a it s a 
it s a

this was not a hotel i wanted
to stay at anymore 
being a celebrity and all 
i needed to check out 
and i had a good idea
how to do it 
tsk tsk tsk 
  gentle music playing  
  gagging  
  man clapping  
  patients wailing  
charles

  superstar   
  audience cheering  
well  that told me 
truth be told  though 
they didn t want me
in there anymore anyway 
apparently  i ve managed
to cost the system
tens of millions of pounds
in damage 
and her majesty no longer
wanted to pleasure herself
with britain s most
expensive prisoner 
i know  it s not the moniker
that i was looking for 
but what were they gonna do 
i mean  they couldn t let
a loony run around for free 
oh yeah 
they had a dirty trick
up their sleeve 
they only went
and certified me sane 
didn t they 
so before i knew it 
i was back on the streets again

in your cooperation 
your responsibility 
your ability to interact
within the group 
i strongly advise
