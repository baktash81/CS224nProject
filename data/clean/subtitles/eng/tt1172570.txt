charles
i knew i was made
for better things
i had a calling
i just didnt know
what as
werent singing

kind of running out
of choices really
arent we
baby its slow
when the lights go low
theres no help no
keys jangling
baby its slow
when the lights go low
theres no help no
hes drilling through
the spiritus sanctus tonight
through the dark hip falls
screaming
oh you mambos kill me
and kill me and kill me
if i jerk the handle
youll die
in your dreams
if i jerk the handle
jerk the handle
youll thrill me
and thrill me
and thrill me
laughs
charles
right how else can i explain it
baby cooing
there was nothing wonky
about my upbringing
my parents were decent
respectable and upstanding
members of society
i went to school
i kept my head down
so like most kids
i got into trouble
you bastard
i liked it
children shouting
teacher whimpering
doorbell rings
oh michael
mrs peterson i really must
talk to you about michael
but i wasnt bad
i wasnt bad bad
and i still have my principles
i took the first job
i could get my hands on
bring the fries peterson
i suppose the crumpet
wasnt bad
doorbell rings
mrs peterson
wed like to have
a word with your son
michael
michael peterson
right
yeah before i forget
i did come into this world
as michael peterson
but ill go out
with my fighting name
charlie bronson
which is my alter ego
screaming
tough time
to be young in england
not a lot of opportunity around
still life moves on
irene and i got hitched
baby crying
it was all right
we didnt have it bad
for a couple from the chippy
but they dont give you
a star on the walk of fame
for not bad do they
crying
metal clangs
michael what is that noise
for gods sakes
so this is the post office
i did over
this is what i got away with
coins rattling
and this is what they gave me
seven years
mother
dont worry son
you wont do the seven
youll be out in four
door locks
crying
laughing
audience laughing
i had you going didnt i
huh
go on
i had you going
ive always fancied myself
as a bit of a comedian
but seven years
is a long time
laughs
now im not gonna
stand here right and tell you
tell you that prison
is not bad
no that would be
misrepresenting myself
and i think enough of that
has been done already
dont you
no
you see i didnt see
a cell a cage
or a box
to me it was a hotel room
chains clanging
indistinct screaming
dont get me wrong
for most people
prison is tough
a monotonous nightmare
24 hours a day
seven days a week
365 days a year
of pure unadulterated
living breathing hell
man wailing
charles
but for me
prison was finally a place
where i could sharpen my tools
hone my skills
its like a battleground
isnt it
it was an opportunity
and a place where soon
every native
was gonna know my name
whats the matter charlie
do you want me to take
you through it again
no we dont do work
in longterm prisons
its vocational training
so you can get a job when
fuck off
sewing machines rattling
whats the problem peterson
problem
i said whats the problem
peterson
i dont know
i dont have a problem
screaming
prisoners cheering
cheering

of british char
milk and sugar

of guns you have there

bambam
knockout dingding

charles laughing
but time stops for no man
ladies and germs
and my time was coming up
parole
and just when i was about
to make a name to be reckoned with
crowd groans
man oh yeah as what

you dont wanna be trapped
inside with me sunshine
inside im someone
nobody wants to fuck with
do you understand
i am charlie bronson
i am britains
most violent prisoner
charles
prison was
honestly brilliant
i liked it personally
fuck that i loved it
it was exciting
it was on the edge
it was madness as its very best
clothes ripping
glass shatters
knives clanging
horse whinnies
the problem is
once you get comfortable
or sometimes even before
they ghost you again
and again
moving you from prison
to prison to prison
and i fucking hate that
parkhurst god bless that place
the accommodation
was more than worthy
of my royal self
your own bed
toilet a sink
the food was
of exceptional standard
yes parkhurst was a corker
and hull prison
well what can i say
well worth a visit
scrubsnot my
favorite place to visit
but the staff are ready
to make your stay
as memorable as possible
we had a laugh
how we laughed
door locks
please release me
let me go
cause i dont love you
