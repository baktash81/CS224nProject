thats right
ive investigating crashes six years
never seen anything like
vetrys plane literally came apart midair like
disassembled piece piece
anyway
chasing ufo
mean ufo responsible vetrys death
responsible
well mr petersons expecting captain go right
presidents scientific advisory board handling
well build firearm
want action mean fast
get back
mr peters fred norwood
please sit
thank captain
give regards co
ill sir
flight testing x
buzzed ufo
accurate
claimed
thats right

would take look please
ufo look anything like
much yes sir
thank
mary see get secretary scrambler

peasant claimed sketch
likeness thing
hidden ruined church near village
get
presumably landed
ruin roofless
landed

bodies two uh
creatures
found nearby
human like yet different
peasants description wasnt intelligent
assumed died
lacked immunity earths bacteria
must oxygen breathers
wouldnt ventured ship
thats purely conjecture course
remains
bodies decayed rapidly
peasants cremated left
major laiton ordinance survival gear
next week foot fly tomorrow
well try marine corp theyll give fast action
youre sending team investigate
investigate destroy
sam archibald
agent china
theyd get second half
could hoax

thing could scientifically advanced
make technology obsolete
red chinese get hands
free world
obsolete
top secret isnt
obviously
yet told much need know

well thats obvious
want go along
youre expecting fly
youll build career
orienting strange aircraft
might get faint notion operates
go
hurry wait
wont much longer think
dont know dave griping wont help
ah forget
im american citizen
griping one
cherished constitutional privileges
yes sir
may go
fred id like meet two favorite geniuses
jack garson
electronics wizard
dave ethrom master metallurgist
gentlemen fred norwood
test pilot told
hes agreed go us
almost target
sleepy jack bored
trying pop ears
im trying pop ears
oh
hey dave
ever jump
neither
hope dont freeze door
rest easy old boy
happens jump master
chap give shot

otherwise must
notify chinese allies
presence
ask doesnt notify chinese allies
right

shall forget ultimatum nonsense
much like shoot
cant afford racket

go
good place breather
alright
stop
iuh
research stanford know

oh
professor wilhous still teaching
yes indeed
great professor
zagorsky
speaking russian
say
well
wants
discuss something
excuse
delightful fella really
charm
id love break little shotgun union
hey theres man good idea

thank
bet great iq
iq whats
brain
intelligence
oh
unusual compliment
well wouldnt dare make usual one
though must say saw underneath waterfall
compares favorably
itll sufficient
see told could make usual one

youre taking shower
electronics expert
specialty superretrobeam feedback determinations
good
oh know americans
resent women scientists
bourgeois society
nothing haus fraus
true sexual equality soviet union
women different men
oh thats bad
soviet women may even soldiers
well wouldnt happen armed
would sargent karachev
going search
say
sure soviet women different men
building
peasants made roof hide air
ill stay quarters
theyre afraid go
mr peters
command
thats right
lets take pictures shall
comrade dubovsky proposes
agree share
great discovery
work together
scientific team exploit
wan na work us
team huh thats right
comrade dubovsky says
later may announce
discoveries world together
minute
tell im concerned guns
communicators
carry arms defend aggression
course know
still dont like see people working guns stuck hips
tell boss
hes willing us inspect arsenal
inspect come
sort understanding
inspection
mr peters
proposed worked team
assure
intention working gun hip
matter
use come scientists
put guns away
put guns away
team leader armed
work team
youll trust us
trust
hank
aint got much choice matter
comrade dubovsky also willing trust
well dont trust
want everybody know

lets get work
morning sam morning
lookout strategic places
well keep night day watch
let give hand fred
talking sam
weve got guided forces around
alright
wait minute
take look see
heavy
wan na take
hold
pretty close
think got inside thing yet
look entire exterior surface completely unbroken
sign door port nothing
look see theyre going
way get thing
maybe using
feel
warm
cool
lets trace
find anything
could dont know yet
door
perfect fit ever seen
theres door
think opens
could like one
electric garage doors
sort signal
says jack
hes working equations
ill go get
jack youre needed
heard noise inside
thats inside
thats jacks electric razor
nono right
inside
hear noise
well fellas ya

stop
never mind made stop
dont find made open
jack give razor
give
crazy
isnt
hit right frequency
see fred
much dark
theres like tube going
kind ladder

canwe climb
well
wants climb inside
speaking russian
comrade dubovsky feel

russian american
forced enter
lets start lot damn protocol
comrade dubovsky insists
procedures part agreement
right right
fred go together
got razor fred
right
easy
hey
close door
didnt hear razor
didnt close


looks like solid metal outside
transparent
must kind plastic
cant see us see
pretty good visibility
sides
gravity couches
would strap
obviously
one explanation
amount strapping
could come back intense speed
quick directional changes
described
power
craft must
generate inner gravitational field
contracts equalizes
gforces
like turn air
like draft
think life support system
unlike cosmonauts
noticed began moment entered
must automatically activated
carbon dioxide exhale
converting co ozone
oxygen based gas
might right
washington
said probably oxygen breathers
thats came ship
shall get others
right
door closed
ive send back factory
shut

control level razor
probably activated gravitational field
adjust properly
squished
like bugs
creating magnetic force
look like panel
might control gravitational field
dont know dont know
dont say got ta take chance
better calculated risk
could relay
kind opens closes electric circuits
hardly stand
button
sure
im saying looks little like
come try
shot dark
lucky
ought find
regulates
gravitational field
must
must similar circuit
open
door floor
multiply
would
located somewhere
could reach
standing near door
whatd know
simple electric eye
come didnt see
alright
got antibiotics vitro
yeah yeah firstaid kit
sick chinese baby
none us would know doctors
karachev
infection throat
hes coughing
dont think better read instructions
dont think necessary
lean please
look
hes wonderful
sam
tell bring baby back immediately
seems worse
dont tell along
talents youre doctor
oh
wanted study medicine
year started school
quota unfilled
electronics majors

commissar education
decided otherwise
told
course
state must decide things
like huh
got angry
think hes going shoot
comrade dubovsky says fraternization
oh yeah
say
conrad dubovsky charge nation
germany sputnik
figured yethuh
figured
ohoh sure simple
one thing seems certain
craft repelled
concocted
universal lines magnetic force
thats simple isnt
oh yes simple
problem
well fred anna means example
wants go
fastens magnetic attraction
say sun
sun zenith
star
position heavens
time day
go
utilizes earths magnetism thats
horizontal flight
beams magnetic attraction
star planet thats
near horizon
believe billions
possible anti magnetism
wouldnt pull
ship every direction
oh secret circuitry
controls
properly adjusted block
magnetic attractions
except one pilot wishes utilize
craft aimed magnetism
thats

could utilize principle
could exploit literally
limitless fields energy
could irrigate deserts
desalt oceans
increase production food
everything onehundred fold
could also manufacture
one hell super weapon
would world want weapons
every country rich prosperous
true dave
say break chow huh
chow chow
chow dog
may proceed madam
want eat dog
lunch guest
oh thats funny

happened
oh tripped chet tried save
oh tripped feet
broken
christ
hey
sounds like
someone
something trying fly
devils going
say
someone trying fly
knew trust
get
take easy
whats matter
teeth hurt steel cups
andre
andre
come dont want us time like
go ahead dave
ill along little
pray
im perfect martyr
think
know
think would done
unless comrade dubovsky ordered
pilot
ive got flight engineer broken wrist
dont work together
would ask permission
comrade dubovsky

forget share knowledge
forgiving
impossible
monopoly would make military opposition invincible
cant attempt take jack
hank believe controls
much onehanded man
could kill us
saw happened gadyakoff
hes right believe
hands full
couldnt monitor
inner gravitational field
built crushed
dave could handle
im foggiest old boy
im metallurgist remember
choice
youve got go girl
mr peters
yes
comrade dubovsky accepts proposal
made comrade norwood last night
anna
blipped together
sure without pilot hes got alternative
neither
hank theyre willing shouldnt
alright
lets get
speaking russian
good luck fred
dont try short liftoff
wasnt planning acrobatics
wow hey
oh fredfred
come take easy
united
russianamerican project
guns
longer necessary
something wrong sam
red patrols area heavy morning
usual
yes
theyve become aware kind
suppressed excitement village
suspicions aroused
could heard sound saucer
well guards would heard
better get back
hes good
speaking chinese
specialists high exorbitant prices
beautiful place
youre beautiful person
zagorsky translated
trusted leaders intentions
says fred anna
fly saucer moscow hell kill us
tell hes crazy
antoine
scientific comrade explained
unbearable distress greatly
anna
go
hell kill
ought shoot petrys head
whats saying
tricked hiding pistol
oh god thats
wonderful coming
tell protest united nations
move
wants know going kill us
youre getting information back moscow

mean keep wanting blow
fred whose side
side survival
whos gain exterminate
ill tell whos gain
red chinese thats
little war attracted red patrol
keep eye wild man
looks like theyre reconnoitering
suspect hes radioing reinforcement
theres whole company village
long take get
long miles
keep eye sam ok
many
eight
looks like theyre radioing reinforcements
said destroy saucer
keep chinese
tell shut
stay corner
hes right
problem two dubovsky shut
hes one greatest physicists world
wants help us
dont need
hell dont
hank need
saw happened
zagorsky anna part
say
problem
saucer practically indestructible
concur
would take extreme heat
something like hydrogen explosion
instance toto melt metal
worst gear
cant leave chinese reds
complete accord
perhaps leave
mean fly
fly

ground
intricate
thousand things

chuck
please check figures
analysis workings
controls based mathematical probabilities
think calculations correct
cant tell without testing anna
well get going
rest us see
airborne try get
get airborne
oh look isnt simple
checked
say take us half hour run
dave give us hand
anna come ill give help
whats going
told fly moscow
fred
youre going fly nearest american airbase formosa
theyre coming whole company
got get stop
least thirty minutes
hank
hank jack stay saucer
thats point
need zagorsky dubovsky
eagle inferno jointing forces destroy dragon
prediction made friend stargazer
live years ago
nostradamus
theyre red chinese
getting saucer much
keep dont fight till give word
damn dubovsky said wait
ready get range

oh yes youre good shot
ok youre bear cat wheels
stalingrad
bunker hill buddy
next time dont fight
see white eyes
waterloo
thats hope
remarkable got stop
yeah
know position strength
wont easy next time
ive run grenades

might stop guys
well give go old boy
youre jolly optimist
luck
cheers
much longer long
right circuits eighty twenty
listen
shooting stopped
youre right
alright lets get
dave
everybody
come
reset horizontal flight
ready jack ready

weve taken like rocket
straight
level fred
something weve done
put us automatic pilot
ship running away us
reset hover
ready readynow
nothing
respond
god
moments weve torn free earths
gravity traveled thousands miles
look
moon
could come far short time
spaceship
approaching speed light
miles per minute
automatic pilot
still locked preset course
maybe drawn magnetic attraction
mars jupiter uranus
maybe distant star many light years beyond solar system
whole bound systems know little
thousands
infinite variety combinations
one reactivate manual control
try one could take weeks
heading stars
nearest one alpha centaur
even speed take us forty years get
heading planet
solar system
crash soon
outer planet
pluto uranus still hours
mars
times already
mars
red planet
well bypass million miles
anna
im going start running
circuit combinations trial error
would take long
eliminate
permutations mathematically
computer
try good
meantime
ill run many combinations possible
jack
check inner gravitational field
thank
jack
saturn
ive observing past ten minutes
dead collision course
collision
waves saturns atmosphere immense
long hit anything solid
ship crushed
compressed size baseball
afraid times run
anna
collide
yes
reduced problem four circuits
numbers
must activated
proper sequence
know sequence
different possibilities
lets try
must work systematically
sequence one open circuits

order

circuits closed


well never make
keep going


back manual
god weve done
well hinting atmosphere seconds
dont know much heat craft stand
better start decelerating

ready
ready

something dropped losing power
lose power shouldnt
like
recheck circuits quick right
burning
decelerate
hit power
feeling better

swiss alps
fred thinking wed like try landing geneva
countries embassies
put record together
agreeable yes yes
know world sees ship
everybody going realize
intelligent beings universe
well meet face face one day
nations earth
better ready stand together
