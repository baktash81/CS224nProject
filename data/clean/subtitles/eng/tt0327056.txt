with a customer  anything 
no  she was herself 
she was happy  she   
she what 
it s nothing 
listen  the littlest thing
could be something right now 
it s just that when she was little 
right after her mother died   
   i had just gotten out of prison 
she couldn t be by herself 
whether she was crying or not 
it didn t matter   
   but she gave a look sometimes  like
she was preparing to never see you again 
for a couple of seconds on saturday 
she looked at me that way 
  okay 
  it was just a look 
it s information  we collect it  put it
together  see what fits  little things 
you were in prison 
  oh  jesus

he said you almost got into a car
when you were kids 
shit  me  jimmy and a kid named boyle
were playing in front of my house 
this car came up and took dave away 
  abduction 
  yeah  guys pretending to be cops 
convinced dave to get in the car 
kept him for four days before he escaped 
  they catch these guys 
  one died 
the other got busted 
went the noose route in his cell 
your pal markum  the moment i laid
eyes on him  i could tell he d done time 
they never lose that tension 
it settles in their shoulders 
he lost his daughter 
that s what s in his shoulders 
no  that s in his stomach 
the tension in his shoulders  that s prison 
the gunshot wound
to the back of the head   
   not the trauma from the beating 
what else 
her and her friends were barhopping 
we re interviewing anyone
who might have seen them 
one other thing 
the backpack in her car   
   had pamphlets on las vegas
and a list of vegas hotels 
it doesn t sound like much 
what do you say  devine 
we ll get the guy  sir 
that s right  all right  let s do it

  it made him happy  didn t it 
this is sean

  i heard a car hit something

  oh  no  not loud like that 
  like hitting the curb 
yes  maybe 
then it stalled  and someone said   hi  
  someone said   hi  
   hi  
then there was a loud crack 
  could it have been a gunshot 
  yes  maybe 
  did you look out your window 
  oh  no 
i was in my dressing gown by then 
i don t look out the window
in my dressing gown 
the voice you heard 
was that a male or a female 
female 
i think 
  it sounds like the girl knew the shooter 
  yeah 
sorry to trouble you 
  jimmy 
  theo 
how s my daughter 
how s annabeth holding up 
  she s trying 
  let s get these on ice 
you got a couple of coolers 
right here s fine 
so how are you handling all this so far 
  it hasn t really sunk in  theo 
  yeah 
it s gonna hurt like hell when it does 
when my janey died 
i was no good for six months   
   but my kids were
all grown up  i had that luxury 
you  you got domestic responsibilities 
domestic responsibilities 
yeah  you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls  that s your first priority 
oh  you figured that might
have slipped my mind 
it just needed to be said  that s all 
you ll come through
because you re a man 
like i said to annabeth 
your wedding day 
i said   you got yourself
a real old school man there  
  like they put her in a bag 
  what 
that s what katie looked like
when i saw her in the morgue 
like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes 
  well   
  janey died in her sleep  all due respect 
she went to sleep 
she never woke up  peaceful 
  you don t need to talk about janey 
  my daughter was murdered 
they put a gun to her  as we
stand here  she s on an autopsy slab   
   getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders   
   and you re talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility 
good to see you  theo 
eve  just tell them what they
want to know 
  who was she dating 
  we already told the savages 
  the savage brothers 
  they were here yesterday 
good  now try us out 
who was she dating 
no one special 
you guys were having
a goodbye dinner  right 
  what 
  she was leaving town  wasn t she 
  going to las vegas 
  how do you know 
she closed her bank account 
she had hotel phone numbers 
she wanted out of this dump 
she wanted to start a new life 
well  a 19 year old girl
doesn t go to las vegas alone 
so who was she going with 
come on  girls 
who was she going with 
brendan 
excuse me 
  brendan 
  brendan harris 
brendan harris  yeah 
you got an address 
hey  dave 
hey  jimmy 
sorry  i came out for a smoke 
go ahead  sit down  sit down 
i haven t had a chance
to talk to you all day 
how you doing 
what happened to your hand 
this 
i was helping a buddy move a couch 
i slammed it in the doorjamb 
ways you can manage
to hurt yourself  right 
it s good to see you 
yeah 
how are our girls holding up

that celeste  she s a godsend 
you thank her for me  will you 
it s nice  isn t it  just to sit out here 
yeah 
i couldn t stand looking through the
fridge to find room for all that food   
   we re gonna throw away
in the next few days 
  lot of waste  huh 
  yeah 
i just can t let anything get fucked up
in these next few days 
because it s all anybody
will remember about her 
one thing you could say about katie 
even when she was little   
   that girl was neat 
when i got out of the joint   
   you know  after marita died   
   i remember  i was more afraid
of my little daughter   
   than i ever was of being in prison 
i loved her   
   most   
   because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night   
   it was like we were the last two
people on earth  you know  forgotten 
unwanted 
and it s really starting to piss me off

and she had to go meet eve and diane 
yeah  why doesn t jimmy markum

i don t know 
but he told katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other harris 
what  that thief thinks he s better
than our family 
he s not a thief 
he s a thief  a scumbag burglar 
daughter probably had the same bad
gene  you count yourself lucky  bren 
so katie had some brochures for vegas 
we heard she was going there with you 
we were gonna leave sunday 
we were gonna get married
when we got there 
well  that was the plan  right 
you were gonna leave me 
without a word 
  ma  i was gonna tell you 
  just like your father  huh 
that s my brother  ray 
and his friend john 
  hey  boys

father couldn t shut up  but his son s
a mute  oh  yeah  life s fucking fair 
they re here about katie  why don t you

so where were you between 12 30
and 2 a m  on sunday morning  brendan 
i was asleep 
can you confirm that  mrs  harris 
i can confirm that he closed his door
at 10 00 
he came down for breakfast at 9 
i can t confirm that he didn t open
his window and go down the fire escape 
okay  we re gonna ask you to take a
polygraph  you think you re up for that 
i loved her so much 
i m never gonna feel that again 
it doesn t happen twice 
doesn t happen once most times 
celeste 
  sorry  jimmy  you surprised me 
  what are you still doing here 
i don t know 
i don t know  i just   
did annabeth get to sleep 
yeah  i convinced her to take a pill 
  could i get one of those 
  yeah

good night 
  good night 
  yeah  good night 
hello 
oh  christ  lauren  say something 
 okay  hey  sean  how was your day  
oh  me  i m tired of wishing
things made sense 
i m tired of caring about
some dead girl   
   and there s just gonna be
another one after her 
sending killers to jail is sending them
where they ve been heading all their lives 
the dead are still dead 
jesus  i   
   can t do this tonight 
i just   
i can t do it 
bye  baby 
because   
   sometimes the man
wasn t a man at all 
he was the boy 
the boy who escaped from wolves 
an animal of the dusk 
invisible 
silent 
living in a world   
   the others never saw 
world of fireflies 
unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye 
vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it 
i just gotta get my head right 
catch a nice  long sleep 
and the boy will go back to his forest 
back to his fireflies 
is he asleep 
how s jimmy and everybody 
okay 
it s weird 
took something like this for me and him
to become friends again 
dave  dave 
there s still nothing in the paper 
about what 
i don t know  honey  maybe i didn t
hurt him as bad as i thought 
he s a mugger  he s not going
to the hospital 
yeah 
right 
anyhow  it doesn t matter  does it 
i mean  katie markum is dead 
that seems more important right now 
i know in my soul i contributed
to your death 
but i don t know how 
brendan harris aced his polygraph 
good  i didn t like him for it 
nor want him for it 
yeah  poor fucking kid 
ballistics will be back in a while 
meantime  we got a list of bar patrons 
all people who  i m certain 
are dying to cooperate 
considering the crime  maybe 
dave boyle 
hey  is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid  the car guy 
could be 
he s a guy to talk to  he knows you 
he won t treat us like cops 
  clam up for no reason  huh

so you look good 
  i hear rents are rising 
  yeah  the yuppies are coming 
they re cutting my dad s

to stop them 
a friend of mine says the other day 
he says

  yeah  you heard about katie markum 
yeah  i was at jimmy s yesterday 
celeste is there now 
  who s celeste 
  my wife 
  how s jimmy doing 
  it s hard to tell  you know him 
  yeah  so the reason we came by   
  listen  i saw her 
katie  i don t know if you know that 
at mcgill s  the night she died 
that s what we wanted to talk about 
they were at a couple of bars that night 
your name turned up for mcgill s 
they put on quite a show
dancing on the bar 
  pretty drunk  huh 
  but it was harmless 
they weren t stripping or nothing 
they were just 19 
what time did they leave 
i left at 1  they must ve left
15 minutes before me 
  so we ll say 12 45 
  sounds about right 
you see anything unusual
or anyone    
michael 
like what 
i don t know 
a guy watching the girls 
a guy with hate in his eyes 
a woman hater 
no  if they hadn t danced on the bar 
it would ve been business as usual 
see you later  dad 
  you got your milk money 
  uh huh 
fuck  i hated school 
what 
oh  uh   
yeah  me too  sean 
uh  just one more thing  mr  boyle 
where did you go after you left mcgill s 
  home 
  15  would you say 
  roughly  sure 
  all right 
yeah  well  thanks a lot  dave 
we ll grab a beer sometime 
  yeah  i d like that  sean 
  all right 
what 
what happened to him in that car 
can you believe this 
man  it s the same as dunkin  donuts 
it costs 15 times the price 
yeah  well   
you know  you take away love 
money or hate as motives   
   you re not left with a whole lot 
well  if this markum thing s random 
i mean  shit 
yeah  tell me about it  but the old lady 
prior  she doesn t hear a scream 
hears a gunshot 
before that a  hi    
   which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him 
she turns to the curb  not too fast or she
hops it  foot s off the clutch  she stalls 
  she says   hi   he shoots her 
  she slams the door into him  takes off 
what makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes 
  i don t know  something in the street 
  maybe 
this markum girl couldn t have
weighed more than what  110 
  hits hard enough to get a jump on him 
  maybe he s knocked back on his heels 
your pal dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels 
whoa  whoa  whoa  wait a second  how
did we get to dave boyle all of a sudden 
  we just got to him 
  he s a guy who was in the bar 
the last place  seany 
the last place she was at 
the guy is wrong  you saw his hand 
yeah  i saw his hand  you seriously
want to take a look at dave boyle

  mrs  boyle 
  nice to meet you 
look  i gotta go 
  oh  damn it 
  what 
i left my report pad in the cruiser 
  you better go get it 
  yeah 
come on 
hey  celeste  could i ask you
a quick question 
  me 
  what time did dave get home saturday 
  what 
  it s a little thing 
we re running a time line on everything
involving katie  i m sure   
   dave told you he saw her
at mcgill s 
you think dave killed katie 
oh  no  god  i didn t say that 
why would i even think that 
  i don t know 
  no  it s just that we could figure out   
   what time she was on the road
if we knew what time dave got home 
see  it s 5 minutes from your place
to mcgill s   
   and katie left 15 minutes
before dave did  you see what i mean 
i was asleep 
saturday night  when dave came in 
i was asleep 
okay  well  thanks 
bullshit 
no  he was dating katie  jim 
they were gonna elope to vegas 
we found tickets under their names 
brendan harris confirmed it 
remember what you said 
how she looked at you on saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again 
  did brendan harris kill my daughter 
  no 
you re 100 percent sure 
passed his poly with flying colors  plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her 
jimmy  i m just curious  man 
why are you so dead set
against that kid 
he said katie told him you d disown
her if she ever dated a harris 
i knew his father  they called him
 just ray  harris 
why is that 
there were so many rays
in the neighborhood 
you had  crazy ray  bucheck 
 psycho ray  dorian 
the cool names were taken 
so he got stuck with  just ray  
we never got along 
i flat out didn t like him 
and he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers 
i don t know 
i just figure the apple doesn t fall
far from the tree 
i didn t want brendan or any other harris
dating katie or any daughter of mine 
i can t believe we re talking about
just ray harris 
how about this  we ve interviewed
witnesses   
   canvassed people
who were in the bar 
we ve run into more than a few of them
who were questioned   
   before us by one or more
of the savage brothers 
  so 
  so the savages are not policemen  jim 
  some people don t talk to policemen 
  with all due respect   
   and just so we re clear 
this is our case 
  how long 
  how long what 
how long before you catch
my daughter s killer 
you bargaining with us 
bargaining 
you giving us a deadline 
we ll speak for katie  mr  markum 
if that s okay with you 
just find my daughter s killer  sergeant 
i m not standing in your way 
the last thing we need is markum and
the savages putting the fear of god   
     into the neighborhood 
  we grew up terrified of those brothers 
eleven months apart  like their mother
ran a loose cannon factory 
fucking knuckleheads 
ballistics are in on the markum murder 
  yeah  you got a match 
  you re gonna love it 
it s a perfect match 
gun was a  38 smith 
part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer
in new hampshire in 1982 
the gun that killed katherine markum
was used in a liquor store holdup in 1984 
  in buckingham 
  the flats 
rome basin  place called looney liquors 
i pulled the file 
it was a two man job 
they fired a warning shot into a wall 
  that s where the bullet got pulled 
  nice work 
thought you d like that 
it s okay  ray 
don t worry about it 
ma said that 
that i m better off 
i loved her  you know what that s like 
i m sorry 
no  you re wrong 
i won t ever feel that again 
right there  went in through a bottle
of jack and stuck in the wall right there 
  scary  huh 
  scarier than a glass of milk  right 
so take me through it 
these two guys come in   
in rubber masks 
they came in through here 
that s the storeroom 
there s a door back there
that leads to a loading dock 
i always keep that door locked 
so they must have had a key 
a key  so  what you re saying
is that it was an inside job 
it had to be  one of them  at least 
worked for me at some point 
the only reason they fired that warning
shot was they must have known   
   i kept this under the counter 
  and you told the police that at the time 
  yeah 
sure  they went through
my employment records 
questioned everybody
who used to work for me 
  never made an arrest 
  still have a copy of those records 
yeah  it s in a box in the office there 
but i know who did it 
oh  yeah 
this guy i fired a couple of weeks before 
son of a bitch came in here
a few days after the robbery 
he had this fucking goddamn grin
on his face 
and i just knew 
go tell a grin to a jury  right 
you remember his name 
do i look senile to you 
  no  sir 
  name   
   was ray harris 
we used to call him  just ray  
you say they used the same gun
for another crime 
  that s correct  sir 
  thanks for your help  mr  looney 
where you been 
out 
what you watching 
some vampire movie 
guy just got his head torn off 
where d you go  celeste 
i was sitting in my car   
   down by the channel 
you know   
   thinking about things 
  what d you think about 
  oh  you know   
no  actually  i don t know 
things  you know  the day 
about katie being dead 
and poor annabeth and jimmy 
you know   
   those things 
those things 
know what i was thinking about  huh 
vampires 
what about them 
they re undead   
   but i think maybe there s
something beautiful about it 
maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what it s like   
   to be human 
maybe then it s okay 
what the fuck you talking about  dave 
vampires  sweetie  werewolves 
you re not making any sense 
you think i killed katie 
  celeste 
  what    
  that the sense we re making these days 
  where d you come up with that 
you ve barely looked at me since you
found out katie was dead 
in fact  you seem repulsed by me 
  dave 
  what 
i don t think anything 
i m confused  okay 
even your friend sean
asked about   
he s not my friend  if you didn t know 
he asked me about you 
what time you came home 
  what d you tell him 
  i said i was asleep 
  that s good thinking  baby 
  jesus christ  dave 
  why not tell them about the mugger 
  the mugger 
the mugger  i see how
your mind s working  i do 
i come home with blood on me
the same night katie s murdered 
i must have killed her  right 
fuck 
henry   
what  henry 
henry and george 
i never told anyone that before 
those were their names 
isn t that fucking hilarious 
at least that s what they called
themselves  but   
   they were wolves  and dave   
   was the boy who escaped
from wolves 
what are you talking about  dave 
i m talking henry and george 
they took me on a four day ride 
they buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag 
and  man  celeste   
   did they have their fun 
and no one came to help old dave then 
dave had to pretend to be
somebody else 
you mean  all those years ago   
   when you were a little boy 
dave   
dave s dead 
i don t know who came out of that
cellar  but it sure as shit wasn t dave 
you see  honey   
fuck 
it s like vampires 
once it s in you   
   it stays 
what stays 
did you know there were
child prostitutes in rome basin 
what 
fuck 
i can t trust my mind anymore  celeste 
i m warning you   
   i can t trust my mind 
i gotta go out 
try to get my head around it 
okay 
  the gun sends us in a different direction 
  i don t see it that way 
what does just ray s gun
have to do with dave 
these things get passed around 
just ray may have blown town 
but his gun never did 
i say we talk with brendan harris
in the morning 
and i say dave boyle  the hand story 
the wife  she s definitely scared 
they re hiding something  but boyle s
as much a killer as brendan harris 
boyle fits the profile  a fucking t 
mid 30s  white  marginally employed   
   sexually abused as a kid  on paper 
this guy should be in jail already 
katie markum
was not sexually abused  see 
in that equation 
sexual emission is part of the deal 
you were friends when you were kids 
this makes you a fucking liability 
hey  he s not my friend 
turns out you re right  i ll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours 
hey  jimmy 
you re out late 
yeah  you too 
it s cold  huh 
yeah  i guess 
you know  i   
i been sitting out here   
   over the last few years   
   waiting on katie to get back
from someplace 
about midnight  i d say to annabeth 
 i m gonna sit on the porch for a while  
weird thing is   
   it seemed to bring her back 
i saw her  you know 
saw who 
katie  i was at mcgill s saturday night 
  you saw katie saturday night 
  never got around to telling you 
did you talk to her 
just nodded hello at one point 
next time i looked up  she was gone 
but  uh   
   jimmy   
   she looked  um   
   happy 
uh  i got more walking to do 
good night 
  you stole his car 
  his car was officially towed 
  from the front of his house 
  no  it was abandoned in rome basin   
   adjacent to the parkway 
lucky for us  the parkway s state
jurisdiction  some kids jacked the car   
     they took it for a joy ride   
  what  why d you do it 
after i left last night  i decided to talk
to boyle myself  put some fear into him 
i get to his house  i decide to look in
his car  see what he s got  i find blood 
  blood 
  front seat of dave s car  b negative 
  how much 
  a bit  found more in the trunk  a lot 
type o  same type as katie markum 
wait  katie markum
never got in anybody s trunk 
she was chased through the park
where she died 
  it s enough to ask questions 
  your search is gonna get tossed out 
no  found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction  for insurance purposes 
  in the best interest of the owner 
  get a physical search  file the report 
bingo 
so  you wanna talk to him 
or should i send him home 
  dave s here 
  i ve had him in the box for an hour 
sent two of my biggest  ugliest troopers
to pick him up 
come on  mr  boyle 
we know you didn t get that swollen
hand sticking it in the garbage disposal 
  oh  yeah  how do you know that 
  why s your wife afraid of you 
she know what really happened
to your hand 
how about a sprite or something 
how about you tell us what really
happened saturday night  mr  boyle 
you lied 
that s your opinion 
which you re entitled to 
  hey  you think this is funny 
  no  i don t  i m tired  i m hung over 
not only was my car stolen last night 
but now you won t release it to me 
okay 
all right 
tell us  mr  boyle 
how did you get the blood in your car 
  what blood 
  let s start with the front seat 
what are you looking at him for 
hey  you think i could get
that sprite  sean 
sure 
oh  i get it 
you re the good cop 
how about a meatball sub
while you re at it 
i ain t your bitch  dave 
looks like you ll have to wait 
yeah  but you re someone s bitch 
aren t you  sean 
the blood on your front seat  dave 
answer the sergeant 
we got a chainlink fence
in our back yard 
me and my kid play wiffle ball
every afternoon after school 
he s getting good  so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence 
so i climb it 
except i slip   
   slice myself where the links curl in 
right here 
bled like hell 
ten minutes later 
i gotta pick up michael at school 
probably was still bleeding
when i got in the front seat 
what blood type are you 
b negative 
yeah  that s the match we got 
  well  there you go 
  not quite 
blood in the trunk of the car
wasn t b negative 
i don t know anything
about any blood in the trunk 
no idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk 
  none 
  this is not the way you wanna go 
how will that look in court 
you not knowing how someone else s
blood got in the trunk of your car 
gonna look fine  i suppose 
you filed the report 
what report 
the stolen car report  the car
wasn t in my possession last night 
so whatever the thieves used it for 
you should find out   
   because it sounds like they
were up to no good 
things looking any better
on the sprite  sean 
well  you just got too fucking smart 
the car is inadmissible 
anything there  his lawyers say
was put by thieves 
  i can break him 
  he just kicked our asses 
you still think dave
wouldn t hurt a fly   
  is that the point  no 
  what is the point 
we can break this open on the gun 
it s the gun 
okay  maybe 
so  what do we do with dave 
fuck it  kick him loose 
maybe a celtic cross 
that s always a popular choice 
or this lovely red marble here 
or a figural 
that one 
very good  nice and simple 
hey  jimmy 
annabeth said you were here 
we been asking around  like you said to 
  yeah 
  yeah 
jimmy  this ain t about the two year bit

stole the truck in rhode island 
drove it into massachusetts 
  hence  the federal interstate rap 
  hence  they got him by the balls  but   
   he does no time 
  he rolled on someone 
  looks that way  after that  he s clean 
  august 1989  poof  he disappears 
  one  dead  two  in witness protection 
three  he goes deep underground 
then pops back up   
   to murder his son s 19 year old
girlfriend  we got nothing 
a prime suspect in a robbery 18 years
ago  during which the weapon was used 
the guy s son dated the victim 
i say we got a lot 
anything about just ray s
known associates 
let s take a look 
reginald  dukie  neil  kevin
 whackjob  sirraci  nicholas savage   
   anthony waxman 
and one james markum 
and the hits just keep on coming 
  you looking for me 
  i m sean devine  this is whitey powers 
i already gotta get back 
so you worked a task force
with major crimes in the  80s 
  bunch of them 
  you took down a smalltimer  ray harris 
he stole a truckload of cigarettes from
a rest stop in cranston  rhode island 
trucker went to take a piss 
harris guy jacks the truck 
i think we pulled him over
in new bedford 
but harris walked 
he didn t walk  he rolled 
boston police anti gang unit stepped in
for info on another case  he rolled 
on who 
what the fuck was the name 
him and three other guys knocked over
the mbta counting room  60 grand 
jimmy markum 
kid was 19  20  slick as hell  man 
ran a crew  never got arrested 
so did harris ever testify in open court 
never went  markum dummied up
on the guys he was working with   
   da was afraid he wouldn t be able
to convict  so he cut a deal 
two years inside 
couple more suspended 
so jimmy markum never knew
that ray harris ratted him out 
ray harris disappeared
about two months   
   after markum rotated back
into the free world

i killed dave 
i killed him  and i threw him
in the mystic 
but i killed the wrong man 
that s what i ve done 
and i can t undo it 
jimmy 
i wanna feel your heart 
last night   
   when i put the girls to bed 
i told them how big your heart was 
  i told them how much you loved katie   
  annabeth 
   because you created her 
and sometimes 
your love for her was so big   
     it felt like your heart would explode   
  please stop 
i told them their daddy
loved them that much too 
that he had four hearts 
and they were all filled up   
   and aching with a love that meant
we would never have to worry 
and that their daddy would do
whatever he had to for those he loved 
and that is never wrong 
that can never be wrong 
no matter what their daddy had to do 
and those girls fell asleep at peace 
you said   last night   you knew 
celeste called  looking for you 
she was worried something might
happen  she told me about dave 
told me what she told you 
what kind of wife   
   says that about her husband 
and why d she run to you 
  why didn t you call 
  because it s like i told the girls 
their daddy s a king 
and a king knows what to do
and does it 
even when it s hard 
and their daddy will do whatever
he has to for those he loves 
and that s all that matters 
because everyone is weak  jimmy 
everyone but us 
we will never be weak 
and you   
you could rule this town 
and after  jimmy
