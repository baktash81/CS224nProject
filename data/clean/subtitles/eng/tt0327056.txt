my first wife marita katies mother
she was a beautiful woman
regal
as a lot of latin women are
and she knew it
you had to have balls
to go near her and i did
eighteen years old the two of us
she was carrying katie
now heres the thing sean
if id gotten into that car
id be a basket case
i never would have had the juice

and she never would have
been murdered you know
see
yeah
you ever see dave around
he married my cousin celeste
what time did katie get home
from work yesterday
around 730
anything unusual
out of the way about her

she was having dinner with her friends
eve pigeon and diane cestra

she talked to nadine
about her communion
and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit
and then around 8 she left
do you know who she talked to
no
do you mind if we have the phone
company subpoenaed for records

good
you spent most of the day saturday
with your daughter in the store correct
yes and no i was mostly in back
anything odd a confrontation
with a customer anything
no she was herself
she was happy she
she what
its nothing
listen the littlest thing
could be something right now
its just that when she was little
right after her mother died
i had just gotten out of prison
she couldnt be by herself
whether she was crying or not
it didnt matter
but she gave a look sometimes like
she was preparing to never see you again
for a couple of seconds on saturday
she looked at me that way
okay
it was just a look
its information we collect it put it
together see what fits little things
you were in prison
oh jesus
here we go
whitey
im just asking
sixteen years ago i did a twoyear bit
for robbery at deer island
is that gonna find
my daughters killer just asking
lets forget about that
lets get back to the point
sorry
its all right its all right
okay mr markum
okay
okay all right so jimmy
outside of the look katie gave you
was there anything else
there was this kid
what am i talking about
that was this morning
what remember its the little things
this kid brendan harris come in the store
like he was expecting to see her
barely knew each other
could they have been dating
no
what makes you so sure
sean are you gonna grill me
a father knows
mrs markum was katie seeing anyone
no one right now as far as we know
i mean knew
ill give you whatever you need tomorrow
we got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is
all right there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home
and if you think of anything
anything at all give us a call
he said you almost got into a car
when you were kids
shit me jimmy and a kid named boyle
were playing in front of my house
this car came up and took dave away
abduction
yeah guys pretending to be cops
convinced dave to get in the car
kept him for four days before he escaped
they catch these guys
one died
the other got busted
went the noose route in his cell
your pal markum the moment i laid
eyes on him i could tell hed done time
they never lose that tension
it settles in their shoulders
he lost his daughter
thats whats in his shoulders
no thats in his stomach
the tension in his shoulders thats prison
the gunshot wound
to the back of the head
not the trauma from the beating
what else
her and her friends were barhopping
were interviewing anyone
who might have seen them
one other thing
the backpack in her car
had pamphlets on las vegas
and a list of vegas hotels
it doesnt sound like much
what do you say devine
well get the guy sir
thats right all right lets do it
thats the best you can come up with
it made him happy didnt it
this is sean
hello
is it lauren
youre in manhattan
i can tell by the traffic sounds
is he with you
is that the baby
christ lauren at least tell me her name
yeah nice talking to you too
hey
would it surprise you
wouldnt be the first time
did you see that girl
did you see that
did you see her
i heard a car hit something
hit what another car
oh no not loud like that
like hitting the curb
yes maybe
then it stalled and someone said hi
someone said hi
hi
then there was a loud crack
could it have been a gunshot
yes maybe
did you look out your window
oh no
i was in my dressing gown by then
i dont look out the window
in my dressing gown
the voice you heard
was that a male or a female
female
i think
it sounds like the girl knew the shooter
yeah
sorry to trouble you
jimmy
theo
hows my daughter
hows annabeth holding up
shes trying
lets get these on ice
you got a couple of coolers
right heres fine
so how are you handling all this so far
it hasnt really sunk in theo
yeah
its gonna hurt like hell when it does
when my janey died
i was no good for six months
but my kids were
all grown up i had that luxury
you you got domestic responsibilities
domestic responsibilities
yeah you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls thats your first priority
oh you figured that might
have slipped my mind
it just needed to be said thats all
youll come through
because youre a man
like i said to annabeth
your wedding day
i said you got yourself
a real oldschool man there
like they put her in a bag
what
thats what katie looked like
when i saw her in the morgue
like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes
well
janey died in her sleep all due respect
she went to sleep
she never woke up peaceful
you dont need to talk about janey
my daughter was murdered
they put a gun to her as we
stand here shes on an autopsy slab
getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders
and youre talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility
good to see you theo
eve just tell them what they
want to know
who was she dating
we already told the savages
the savage brothers
they were here yesterday
good now try us out
who was she dating
no one special
you guys were having
a goodbye dinner right
what
she was leaving town wasnt she
going to las vegas

she wanted out of this dump
she wanted to start a new life

yeah
i couldnt stand looking through the
fridge to find room for all that food
were gonna throw away
in the next few days
lot of waste huh
yeah
i just cant let anything get fucked up
in these next few days
because its all anybody
will remember about her
one thing you could say about katie
even when she was little
that girl was neat
when i got out of the joint
you know after marita died
i remember i was more afraid
of my little daughter
than i ever was of being in prison
i loved her
most
because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night
it was like we were the last two
people on earth you know forgotten
unwanted
and its really starting to piss me off
dave because i cant cry for her
my own little daughter
and i cant even cry for her
jimmy
youre crying now
yeah damn
i just want to hug her one more time
she was 19 fucking years old
do you want me to leave you alone
no just stay here for a minute
if thats cool
yeah sure jimmy its cool
when was the last time
you saw katie markum
you dont think id hurt her do you
she isnt hurt shes dead
i didnt kill her
again whens the last time you saw her
about 8
saturday night about 800
about like 8 brendan or at 8

we had a couple slices at hifi
and she had to go meet eve and diane
yeah why doesnt jimmy markum
like you
i dont know
but he told katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other harris
what that thief thinks hes better
than our family
hes not a thief
hes a thief a scumbag burglar
daughter probably had the same bad
gene you count yourself lucky bren
so katie had some brochures for vegas
we heard she was going there with you
we were gonna leave sunday
we were gonna get married
when we got there
well that was the plan right
you were gonna leave me
without a word
ma i was gonna tell you
just like your father huh
thats my brother ray
and his friend john
hey boys
hey
he dont speak
father couldnt shut up but his sons
a mute oh yeah lifes fucking fair
theyre here about katie why dont you
go watch tv or something

and 2 am on sunday morning brendan
i was asleep
can you confirm that mrs harris

at 1000
he came down for breakfast at 9
i cant confirm that he didnt open
his window and go down the fire escape
okay were gonna ask you to take a
polygraph you think youre up for that
i loved her so much
im never gonna feel that again
it doesnt happen twice
doesnt happen once most times
celeste

good night
yeah good night
hello
oh christ lauren say something
okay hey sean how was your day
oh me im tired of wishing
things made sense
im tired of caring about
some dead girl
and theres just gonna be
another one after her
sending killers to jail is sending them
where theyve been heading all their lives
the dead are still dead
jesus i
cant do this tonight
i just
i cant do it
bye baby
because
sometimes the man
wasnt a man at all
he was the boy
the boy who escaped from wolves
an animal of the dusk
invisible
silent
living in a world
the others never saw
world of fireflies
unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye
vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it
i just gotta get my head right
catch a nice long sleep
and the boy will go back to his forest
back to his fireflies
is he asleep
hows jimmy and everybody
okay
its weird
took something like this for me and him
to become friends again
dave dave
theres still nothing in the paper
about what
i dont know honey maybe i didnt
hurt him as bad as i thought
hes a mugger hes not going
to the hospital
yeah
right
anyhow it doesnt matter does it
i mean katie markum is dead

to your death
but i dont know how
brendan harris aced his polygraph

money or hate as motives
youre not left with a whole lot
well if this markum things random
i mean shit
yeah tell me about it but the old lady
prior she doesnt hear a scream

she turns to the curb not too fast or she
hops it foots off the clutch she stalls
she says hi he shoots her
she slams the door into him takes off
what makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes
i dont know something in the street
maybe
this markum girl couldnt have
weighed more than what 110
hits hard enough to get a jump on him

i left my report pad in the cruiser

yeah
come on
hey celeste could i ask you
a quick question
me
what time did dave get home saturday
what
its a little thing
were running a time line on everything
involving katie im sure
dave told you he saw her
at mcgills
you think dave killed katie
oh no god i didnt say that
why would i even think that
i dont know
no its just that we could figure out
what time she was on the road
if we knew what time dave got home
see its 5 minutes from your place
to mcgills
and katie left 15 minutes
before dave did you see what i mean
i was asleep
saturday night when dave came in
i was asleep
okay well thanks
bullshit
no he was dating katie jim
they were gonna elope to vegas
we found tickets under their names
brendan harris confirmed it
remember what you said
how she looked at you on saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again
did brendan harris kill my daughter
no
youre 100 percent sure
passed his poly with flying colors plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her
jimmy im just curious man
why are you so dead set
against that kid
he said katie told him youd disown
her if she ever dated a harris
i knew his father they called him
just ray harris
why is that
there were so many rays
in the neighborhood
you had crazy ray bucheck
psycho ray dorian
the cool names were taken
so he got stuck with just ray
we never got along
i flat out didnt like him
and he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers
i dont know
i just figure the apple doesnt fall
far from the tree
i didnt want brendan or any other harris
dating katie or any daughter of mine
i cant believe were talking about
just ray harris
how about this weve interviewed
witnesses
canvassed people
who were in the bar
weve run into more than a few of them
who were questioned
before us by one or more
of the savage brothers
so
so the savages are not policemen jim
some people dont talk to policemen
with all due respect
and just so were clear
this is our case
how long
how long what
how long before you catch
my daughters killer
you bargaining with us
bargaining
you giving us a deadline
well speak for katie mr markum
if thats okay with you
just find my daughters killer sergeant
im not standing in your way
the last thing we need is markum and
the savages putting the fear of god
into the neighborhood
we grew up terrified of those brothers
eleven months apart like their mother
ran a loosecannon factory
fucking knuckleheads
ballistics are in on the markum murder
yeah you got a match
youre gonna love it
its a perfect match
gun was a 38 smith
part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer
in new hampshire in 1982
the gun that killed katherine markum
was used in a liquorstore holdup in 1984
in buckingham
the flats
rome basin place called looney liquors
i pulled the file
it was a twoman job
they fired a warning shot into a wall
thats where the bullet got pulled
nice work
thought youd like that
its okay ray
dont worry about it
ma said that
that im better off
i loved her you know what thats like
im sorry
no youre wrong
i wont ever feel that again
right there went in through a bottle
of jack and stuck in the wall right there
scary huh
scarier than a glass of milk right
so take me through it
these two guys come in
in rubber masks
they came in through here
thats the storeroom
theres a door back there
that leads to a loading dock
i always keep that door locked
so they must have had a key
a key so what youre saying
is that it was an inside job
it had to be one of them at least
worked for me at some point
the only reason they fired that warning
shot was they must have known
i kept this under the counter
and you told the police that at the time
yeah
sure they went through
my employment records
questioned everybody
who used to work for me
never made an arrest
still have a copy of those records
yeah its in a box in the office there
but i know who did it
oh yeah
this guy i fired a couple of weeks before
son of a bitch came in here
a few days after the robbery
he had this fucking goddamn grin
on his face
and i just knew
go tell a grin to a jury right
you remember his name
do i look senile to you
no sir
name
was ray harris
we used to call him just ray
you say they used the same gun
for another crime
thats correct sir
thanks for your help mr looney
where you been
out
what you watching
some vampire movie
guy just got his head torn off
whered you go celeste
i was sitting in my car
down by the channel
you know
thinking about things
whatd you think about
oh you know
no actually i dont know
things you know the day
about katie being dead
and poor annabeth and jimmy
you know
those things
those things
know what i was thinking about huh
vampires
what about them
theyre undead
but i think maybe theres
something beautiful about it
maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what its like
to be human
maybe then its okay
what the fuck you talking about dave
vampires sweetie werewolves
youre not making any sense
you think i killed katie
celeste
what
that the sense were making these days
whered you come up with that
youve barely looked at me since you
found out katie was dead
in fact you seem repulsed by me
dave
what
i dont think anything
im confused okay
even your friend sean
asked about
hes not my friend if you didnt know
he asked me about you
what time you came home
whatd you tell him
i said i was asleep
thats good thinking baby
jesus christ dave
why not tell them about the mugger
the mugger
the mugger i see how
your minds working i do
i come home with blood on me
the same night katies murdered
i must have killed her right
fuck
henry
what henry
henry and george
i never told anyone that before
those were their names
isnt that fucking hilarious
at least thats what they called
themselves but
they were wolves and dave
was the boy who escaped
from wolves
what are you talking about dave
im talking henry and george
they took me on a fourday ride
they buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag
and man celeste
did they have their fun
and no one came to help old dave then
dave had to pretend to be
somebody else
you mean all those years ago
when you were a little boy
dave
daves dead
i dont know who came out of that
cellar but it sure as shit wasnt dave
you see honey
fuck
its like vampires
once its in you
it stays
what stays
did you know there were
child prostitutes in rome basin
what
fuck
i cant trust my mind anymore celeste
im warning you
i cant trust my mind
i gotta go out
try to get my head around it
okay
the gun sends us in a different direction
i dont see it that way
what does just rays gun
have to do with dave
these things get passed around
just ray may have blown town
but his gun never did
i say we talk with brendan harris
in the morning
and i say dave boyle the hand story
the wife shes definitely scared
theyre hiding something but boyles
as much a killer as brendan harris
boyle fits the profile a fucking t
mid30s white marginally employed
sexually abused as a kid on paper
this guy should be in jail already
katie markum
was not sexually abused see
in that equation
sexual emission is part of the deal
you were friends when you were kids
this makes you a fucking liability
hey hes not my friend
turns out youre right ill have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours
hey jimmy
youre out late
yeah you too
its cold huh
yeah i guess
you know i
i been sitting out here
over the last few years
waiting on katie to get back
from someplace
about midnight id say to annabeth
im gonna sit on the porch for a while
weird thing is
it seemed to bring her back
i saw her you know
saw who
katie i was at mcgills saturday night
you saw katie saturday night
never got around to telling you
did you talk to her
just nodded hello at one point
next time i looked up she was gone
but uh
jimmy
she looked um
happy
uh i got more walking to do
good night

his car was officially towed
from the front of his house
no it was abandoned in rome basin
adjacent to the parkway
lucky for us the parkways state
jurisdiction some kids jacked the car

what whyd you do it
after i left last night i decided to talk
to boyle myself put some fear into him
i get to his house i decide to look in

front seat of daves car bnegative
how much
a bit found more in the trunk a lot
type o same type as katie markum
wait katie markum
never got in anybodys trunk
she was chased through the park
where she died
its enough to ask questions
your search is gonna get tossed out
no found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction for insurance purposes
in the best interest of the owner
get a physical search file the report
bingo
so you wanna talk to him
or should i send him home
daves here
ive had him in the box for an hour
sent two of my biggest ugliest troopers
to pick him up
come on mr boyle
we know you didnt get that swollen
hand sticking it in the garbage disposal
oh yeah how do you know that
whys your wife afraid of you
she know what really happened
to your hand
how about a sprite or something
how about you tell us what really
happened saturday night mr boyle

which youre entitled to
hey you think this is funny

what are you looking at him for
hey you think i could get
that sprite sean

how will that look in court
you not knowing how someone elses
blood got in the trunk of your car

you filed the report

anything there his lawyers say
was put by thieves

nora huh
well i like that nora
i killed dave
i killed him and i threw him
in the mystic
but i killed the wrong man
thats what ive done
and i cant undo it
jimmy
i wanna feel your heart
last night
when i put the girls to bed
i told them how big your heart was
i told them how much you loved katie
annabeth
because you created her
and sometimes
your love for her was so big
it felt like your heart would explode
please stop
i told them their daddy
loved them that much too
that he had four hearts
and they were all filled up
and aching with a love that meant
we would never have to worry
and that their daddy would do
whatever he had to for those he loved
and that is never wrong
that can never be wrong
no matter what their daddy had to do
and those girls fell asleep at peace
you said last night you knew
celeste called looking for you
she was worried something might
happen she told me about dave
told me what she told you
what kind of wife
says that about her husband
and whyd she run to you
why didnt you call
because its like i told the girls
their daddys a king
and a king knows what to do
and does it
even when its hard
and their daddy will do whatever
he has to for those he loves
and thats all that matters
because everyone is weak jimmy
everyone but us
we will never be weak
and you
you could rule this town
and after jimmy
