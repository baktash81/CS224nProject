as planned anyway 
toro  sounds like a load of bull 
james 
be careful 
well  small world  you re a toro  too 
i ll see you in miami 
fill her up 
your guests have arrived  ambassador 
we should go  my dear 
well   
you become more beautiful every day 
  i m over here 
  of course you are 
this is miss penelope smallbone 
my new assistant 
miss smallbone 
what can i say  moneypenny  except that
she is as attractive and as charming   
  as i used to be 
  i didn t say that 
you re such a flatterer  james 
moneypenny  you know there never has
been and never will be anybody but you 
so you ve told me 
  welcome to universal exports 
  take it  dear 
  that s all you ll ever get from him 
  thank you  commander bond 
  do you know me 
  miss moneypenny described you 
in nauseating detail 
really 
i can see you re going
to fit in here very nicely 
  good morning  007 
  morning  sir 
  minister 
  commander 
i think you know jim fanning 
our art expert 
  yes  hello  jim 
  james 
  do you know what this is 
  it looks like a fabergé egg  sir 
one of the jewelled eggs by carl fabergé
as a gift for the russian royal family 
they re priceless and very rare 
this one contains a model
of the imperial state coach 
  top marks  007 
  thank you  sir 
except it s a fake 
there s the real thing  it s being
auctioned at sotheby s this afternoon 
this is the fourth egg
to turn up at auction this year 
it s from none of the usual sources 
anonymous seller  swiss bank account 
i d say that the vendor was a russian 
and now this turns up 
a near perfect forgery 
i think commander bond
should accompany you to the sale 
splendid  i could use
an extra pair of eyes 
we could try and spot the seller 
they usually turn up out of interest
or perhaps just to bump up the price 
thank you  fanning 
not at all 
if it is the russians 
it may be an effort to raise currency
for covert operations abroad
or for payoffs 
either way 
we d better find out what they re up to 
  yes  minister 
  eyes only  007 
operation trove 
you ll be replacing 009 
he turned up dead in east germany
with that egg in his hand 
there s not much to go on 
well  we do have one lead  minister 
 property of a lady  
next on the agenda is the continuing
mutual disarmament talks with nato 
i assume you ve all read
general gogol s report 
it seems very thorough 
thank you  comrade chairman 
i believe i express the opinion
of everyone present
that adoption of nato proposals does
not compromise our defensive position 
  comrade chairman 
  general orlov 
general gogol is presumptuous 
he speaks for himself and others
who cling to timid  outdated
and unrealistic policies 
must i remind you  the committee 
of our overwhelming superiority
over nato forces
before we give it away 
in east germany
under my direct command 
i have 31 divisions 
including 1 1 tank divisions
and another five in czechoslovakia 
in support  on the russian western
border are 60 divisions 
including 22 tank divisions 
in all  a 1 0 1 advantage 
american and west german forces
can field at most ten armoured divisions 
the british maintain only a token force 
we have played out a variety of attack
strategies on the new kutuzov computer
and find that a lightning thrust by
ten armoured divisions from the north 
and by five more through czechoslovakia 
lead to total victory in five days
against any possible defence scenario 
this is absolute madness 
we know where it will end 
nato will counterattack
with nuclear weapons 
never 
the west is decadent and divided 
it has no stomach
to risk our atomic reprisals 
throughout europe  daily demonstrations
demand unilateral nuclear disarmament 
i see no reason to risk war
to satisfy your personal paranoia
and thirst for conquest 
we must turn our energies
to pressing domestic problems 
  general gogol  let me remind you   
  comrades  sit down 
  i wish to tell you   
  both of you 
world socialism
will be achieved peaceably 
our military role is strictly defensive 
is that understood  general orlov 
general gogol  would you continue 
thank you  comrade chairman  i will
now turn to the specifics of my report   
tell him i will be there
as quickly as possible 
please  please 
  i am trying to concentrate 
  lenkin 
  what is it 
  it s terrible news  comrade general 
the reproduction
has been stolen in transit 
the thief was dealt with 
but the egg was lost in the river 
your incompetence will destroy us all 
  we ll have a replacement made 
  there is no time  comrade general 
i have just been informed of
an unscheduled inventory in two days 
control yourself 
i ll tell our london people
we must have the genuine egg back 
i hope we can reach them in time 
sold to busoni 
the next lot is number 48 
a superb green gold
imperial easter egg by carl fabergé 
enamelled in translucent green 
enclosed by gold laurel leaf trellis 
set with blue sapphires and
four petalled gold flowers with diamonds 
  how much should it fetch 
   250 300 000  anything more d be crazy 
   used by tsar nicholas
in 1 897 in moscow 
property of a lady 
well  there are quite a few ladies here 
she wouldn t have to be here in person 
she could be represented by proxy 
i ll start it at  1 50 000 
1 50  60 
1 70  1 70 
1 80  1 90

  you know him 
kamal khan  usually a seller 
marginal quality from dubious sources 
 380 000

  well  that should do it 
  kamal has gone over the top 
  your bid  sir  400 000 
400 000  any more 
425  new bidder

 500 000 
i have half a million pounds  all done 
any more 
yours  sir  for  500 000 
  the next lot is   
  we could have been stuck with it 
  i doubt it  he had to buy it 
  but why 
that s what i intend to find out 
you had no business bidding for that egg 
what would you have done if you d got it 
i would have claimed it was a fake  sir 
and not paid 
not paid 
here s the original  i switched it
with the fake during the auction 
good god 
and what happens
when the buyer discovers that 
well  he complains  if he s legitimate 
  well 
  i don t think he will complain 
according to fanning 
this kamal usually sells  now he buys 
i believe that the fake will smoke him out 
our tail followed him to heathrow
where he caught a plane to delhi 
you must go there  too 
i ll alert sadruddin  our man in station i 
to keep him under surveillance 
  book yourself on the next flight out

q 
  how are you 
  most unhappy  007  thanks to you 
how can i be expected
to maintain the quality of my work 
sent out here at a moment s notice 
have you any smaller thread 
someone stuck a knife in my wallet 
pity they missed you 
karen  see to that  will you 
i ve also mislaid my ppk 
  anything else 
  no  that s all 
blast 
having problems keeping it up  q 
experimental model 
  hello  smithers 
  commander 
  smashing  q 
  come on  i have a few things for you 
very nice  smithers 
is the homing device ready yet 
not only a homing device  but an
extremely delicate microphone as well 
it goes in there like that 
now  take a fountain pen 
twist the top 
and a highly concentrated mixture
of nitric and hydrochloric acid 
  dissolves all metals 
  wonderful for poison pen letters 
pay attention  007 
pull the top off the pen 
with this ultrasensitive earpiece 
you can listen in on the bug 
the homing device is compatible with
the radio directional finder in your watch 
if you haven t lost it 
that s amazing  q  it does work 
what s that 
that s the latest liquid crystal tv 
very handy 
perfect image  q 
really  007 
look  i haven t time
for these adolescent antics 
  it s the best we can do 
  it s beautiful  thank you 
go on  get along  i ve got my work to do 
  i ll give you a hand  q 
  thank you 
don t forget this 
don t let him teach you
any of his bad habits 
mr bond  your table is ready 
  i didn t reserve one 
  your guest is waiting  sir 
this way  please 
thank you 
you changed your mind 
  i m glad 
  are you 
well  let s put it this way 
so far  you are the least lethal and
by far the prettiest of kamal s friends 
thank you 
so does he have
a proposition for me  or do you 
he suggests a trade 
the egg for your life 
i d heard the price of eggs
was going up  but isn t that a little high 
charge it to room   
oh  27  along with the champagne  i suppose 
i ll leave it at the desk 
you don t mind 
why  has kamal forgotten
what i look like already 
it s for me 
so that if i depart this world suddenly 
you ll have something
to remember me by 
something like that 
it s for my scrapbook  i collect memories 
well  let s get on with making a few 
i need refilling 
of course you do 
i ll get some more 
don t bother 
we ll make yours a loving cup 
what a good idea 
forgive my curiosity  but what is that 
that s my little octopussy 
good morning 
morning 
i didn t want to wake you 
but since you re up 
i can say a proper goodbye 
what is the time 
beautiful view  isn t it 
  i don t know how to say goodbye 
  actions speak louder than words 
so right 
in  out  in  out 
come on  girls  in  out 
check oars 
the egg has been recovered 
you should be pleased 
i m not pleased
it was stolen in the first place 
nor that the thief
knows enough to bring it here 
he s obviously an adventurer
with possible blackmail on his mind 
anyway  i have him as my guest
at the monsoon palace 
and he will tell us
all he knows very quickly 
  who is he 
  englishman 
likes eggs  preferably fabergé 
and dice  preferably loaded 
his name is james bond 
bring him here 
he s dangerous  after he s talked 
we must get rid of him immediately 
no 
a  no  from you
has little chance of becoming a  yes  
i assume  therefore 
that the meeting is over 
but you re making a serious mistake 
well  so far i can t complain
about the valet service 
dinner  8 o clock 
  good evening  mr bond 
  good evening 
well rested 
i believe you and miss magda have met 
  it was a pleasure 
  you re too kind 
you don t mind if we start 
the soufflé can t wait 
at the risk of appearing
to be making light dinner conversation 
may i ask exactly why i am here 
i mean  after all  you do have the egg 
true  but we don t have all the answers 
well  supposing  for argument s sake 
i don t feel like talking 
don t worry  you will 
let me guess 
thumbscrews and hot coals 
hardly  we re much more
sophisticated than that 
  sodium pentothal 
  a bit crude  very unreliable 
we prefer curare with
an effective psychedelic compound 
guaranteed results 
  but with permanent brain damage 
  an unfortunate side effect 
one of our specialities 
stuffed sheep s head 
it s odd  but when i m stared at
i seem to lose my appetite 
oh  thank you for dinner 
until tomorrow  then 
  well  i ll say good night 
  i could come in for a nightcap 
some other time  perhaps 
i don t suppose you d care
for a nightcap  no 
i trust you had a pleasant flight 
if you step this way  i think you
will find everything is in order 
congratulations on the quality of
your workmanship  kamal khan 
thank you  general orlov 
as you can see  each piece
has been meticulously duplicated
according to lenkin s specifications 
good  have it put aboard the helicopter 
  can they be trusted 
  l assure you of their silence 
we are both playing for enormous stakes 
i get what i want 
then you get the genuine jewellery 
exactly   
the precise timing will be essential 
remember  nothing must be changed 
one week from today  in karl marx stadt 
  karl marx stadt 
  correct 
  everything taken care of 
  as you ordered  excellence 
  so  you recovered it 
  from an accomplice of the thief 
he must be eliminated at once 
there must be no further security breach 
this fake has caused enough trouble 
i must go 
everything has been most satisfactory 
most kind  general orlov 
get bond 
the englishman has escaped 
he won t go very far  we ll track him 
good 
let the sport commence 
head him off 
sit 
we have him 
go round  he s in there 
hiss off 
don t let him get away 
c mom  buddy  c mon 
  hey  you all right  buddy 
  i m fine 
  are you with our group 
  no  ma am  i m with the economy tour 
mr bond is indeed a very rare breed 
soon to be made extinct 
genus hapalochlaena  produces a venom
that s invariably fatal in seconds 
the barge had that sign 
it belongs to a wealthy woman
who lives on the floating palace 
who 
no one knows her real name 
but she s known as octopussy 
that s the name i heard at kamal s 
i hear that island s full of
beautiful women  no men allowed 
really  sexual discrimination 
i ll definitely have to pay it a visit 
good evening 
i wondered when you might arrive 
so you are the mysterious octopussy 
and you are james bond 
007  licensed to kill 
am i to be your target for tonight 
not necessarily 
depends how much you tell me
about jewellery smuggling 
and why one of our agents
was killed in east berlin 
i know nothing about that 
you remember major dexter smythe 
you were sent out to arrest him 
weren t you 
you seem to have done your homework 
thank you  yes  smythe 
after a brilliant
military career  joined
our secret service 
his mission was to recover a cache
of chinese gold  seized in north korea 
both he and his native guide disappeared 
the gold was never found 
and 20 years later
you were sent after him 
the guide s body turned
up with a bullet
still in his skull from
smythe s revolver 
i traced smythe to sri lanka 
and gave him 24 hours to clear up
his affairs before i took him back 
he committed suicide rather than
face the disgrace of a court martial 
what s the connection 
he was my father  i d hoped
fate would bring us together one day 
to avenge him 
to thank you for giving him
an honourable alternative 
come in 
kamal khan to see you 
bond has escaped 
  how careless of you 
  i apologise 
by the way  i d like you
to meet my new house guest 
an old friend of the family  you might say 
how lovely 
you have a nasty habit of surviving 
you know what they say about the fittest 
octopussy  i d enjoy another opportunity
to take care of mr bond personally 
i will take care of mr bond myself 
good night 
and enjoy yourselves 
mr bond 
my father became
a leading authority on octopi 
he loved them 
his pet name for me was octopussy 
mr bond  smuggling is
no concern of the secret service 
i ve violated no british law 
you are free to leave 
but i d much prefer
if you stayed as my
guest for a few days 
i d like that 
gwendoline  show mr bond to his room 
good night  mr bond 
till the morning  then 
midge 
extend mr bond every courtesy 
but double the guard on his quarters 
he says the island is heavily guarded 
we don t want to
make enemies with the woman 
the woman must not be harmed 
when father s gold ran out  the people in
hong kong who d disposed of it for him
offered me a commission
to smuggle some diamonds 
i discovered i had a talent for it 
you went into business for yourself 
yes  but i needed an organisation 
so i revived the old octopus cult 
well  then 
where did you recruit all these lovelies 
there are many of them
all over southeast asia 
looking for a guru 
spiritual discipline  who knows what 
i train them  give them a purpose 
a sisterhood and a way of life 
  in crime 
  in business 
i have diversified into
shipping  hotels  carnivals and circuses 
  is he still there 
  you must be joking 
007 on an island
populated exclusively by women 
we won t see him till dawn 
  i ll relieve you at midnight 
  no problem 
are we going somewhere 
i have to go to europe tomorrow
on a business trip 
oh  that s a pity 
i was just beginning to enjoy myself 
i think you should stay 
i ll only be gone a week 
when i come back
we ll discuss the future 
well  i can t guarantee
that i ll be here when you return 
oh  james  we re two of a kind 
there are vast rewards for a man
of your talents willing to take risks 
  i m not for hire 
  a man of principle 
with a price on his head 
naturally  you would do it
for queen and country 
i have no country 
i have no price on my head 
i don t have to apologise to you 
a paid assassin  for what i am 
no 
you re right 
we are two of a kind 
james 
q 
is something wrong 
not really 
just a feeling 
why don t you come back to bed 
move 
james 
watch it 
come on 
careful 
the gun 
what happened to vijay 
he was alive when i found him 
  did he say anything 
  only  it was kamal s men  
no more problems 
  better signal m to meet me in berlin 
  why 
well  i have to go to a circus
in karl marx stadt 
we verified the octopussy circus
was in east berlin when we lost 009 
karl marx stadt is further east 
why would general orlov
participate in a jewellery caper 
well  the jewellery  sir 
i think is  if you ll forgive the analogy 
only the tip of the tentacle 
here s the id you ll need 
charles moreton  manufacturer s
representative from leeds
visiting furniture factories
in east germany 
  karl will take you in 
  no problem 
remember  007  you re on your own 
thank you  sir  that s a great comfort 
mischka 
of course you know comrade borchoi 
the curator of the hermitage 
he just arrived from leningrad 
the romanov star 
stay here with the jewellery while
they switch the car to the main track 
you stay  also 
1 00 kiloton yield 
the effects are indistinguishable
from the american medium yield bomb 
the detonator  now listen carefully 
it is pre set for a four hour delay 
set time for the explosion here 
to activate  insert and twist
the lever a quarter turn clockwise 
be at least 20 miles away
when it goes off 
the jewellery should net us
300 million in zürich 
we still have to cross the border 
i must go 
au revoir  dear lady 
good luck 
bring the canister 
put it in the car 
leave that  let s go 
let s stay  sit on that box 
hands on your knees  come on  move 
why is that bomb on the train 
  who are you 
  british secret service 
you should be more concerned
about getting out of here alive 
i am more concerned about an atomic
bomb exploding on a us air force base 
you can t be inviting a nuclear war 
what happens when the us retaliates 
against whom 
my god  of course 
our early warning system will rule out
the bomb having come from russia
or anywhere else 
everyone will assume incorrectly that
it was a us bomb triggered accidentally 
that would be
the most plausible explanation 
europe will insist on disarmament 
leaving every border undefended
for you to walk across at will 
it doesn t matter a damn to you
that thousands of innocent people
will die in your accident 
better than letting
a handful of old men in moscow
bargain away our advantage
in disarmament talks 
on your feet  general 
you re going to stop that train 
  too late 
  you can stop it at the border 
kill him 
get to the station 
stop that car 
stop 
follow that car 
kamal khan says we are to stay here
until we cross the border 
the licence plate is general orlov s 
we have discovered this 
  where is general orlov now 
  last reported heading for the border 
i must get to that train 
stop 
a common thief 
a disgrace to the uniform 
yes  but tomorrow 
i shall be a hero
of the soviet union 
it is now 1 1  45 
the performance begins at 3 
allowing for delays 
set the bomb to detonate at 3 45 
we must leave the base by 3  1 5 
i take it none of you will be late 
the jewellery 
  did you recognise him 
  no 
stay here with her 
on the roof  trouble 
mischka 
and this 
for my brother 
and that s for 009 
gobinda will stay with the jewellery 
general  excuse me  i have some travel
arrangements to make  enjoy the show 
  thank you 
  i m sure he ll get a big blast out of this 
i know he won t be disappointed 
  that was bond 
  good  let him keep going 
he ll be late and we ll be rid of him too 
great  isn t it 
fantastic 
  marvellous 
  general 
how long would i get
in the brig if i stole your wallet 
  about two years 
  that long 
well  in that case  i d better return it 
son of a gun 
  where s the base commander 
  let s see your circus pass 
damn it  man  it s urgent 
get out  hands up 
some nut in a red shirt went through in
a stolen car  wants the base commander 
there he is 
go after that guy in the red shirt 
behind the trailers 
keep searching  you guys 
he s gotta be around here somewhere 
look under the trailer  you guys 
  ladies and gentlemen   
  hey  is anyone else in there 
for the first time in this country 
the death defying human cannonball

my government categorically denies
the incident ever occurred 
however  we request bond to return
one of our most historic treasures 
the romanov star 
in the interests of our anglo soviet
relationships  that can be arranged 
where is commander bond 
owing to the serious nature of his injuries 
he s still not fit enough to travel 
in  out  in  out 
  i wish

i wish you weren t
in such a weakened condition
