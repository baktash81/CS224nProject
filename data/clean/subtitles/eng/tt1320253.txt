  yeah 
it s a little island in the gulf 
that s right 
  you should read more 
  thanks 
there are resources on that island
that my people are very interested in 
but a general by the name of garza
has overthrown the half ass government 
that s right 
my people are having a problem
with this fanatic garza 
  so you want garza gone 
  i want him dead 
all it takes is a little army 
only an idiot would do this job 
  how much 
  oh  like i said 
i m busy anyway 
so give this job to my friend here 
he loves playing in the jungle 
  right 
  right 
hey  why don t we have dinner 
sure  when 
  in a thousand years 
  too soon 
  what s his fucking problem 
  he wants to be president 
i got to recon this island first 
i ll have a contact for you on the island 
good riddance 
i got a feeling everyone else
has passed on this job 
so our fee is  5 mil 
   5 mil 
  and i want half upfront 
and the other half in an offshore account 
  you got a problem with that 
  no 
what i have a problem with
is people who try to fuck me over 
so if you take this money
and you don t deliver 
me and my people
are gonna come get you and your people
and chop you up
into little fucking dog treats 
you got a problem with that 
let s talk 
whoever stood you up sounds bad 
yeah  but it will pay good 
yeah  well  money aside 
what happened to your code 
what code s that 
 the target has to deserve it  
that was canceled due to lack of interest 
  you re dark  dark and cold 
  you noticed 
  and i ain t buying into that  by the way 
  you will 
stick around  young man  you will

  hmm 
you can t trust me 
i can t 
you can t trust me 
be careful 
you threatening me  gunner 
nah  i m a nice guy 
so  going over the info
this guy church gave me 
there s probably about
6 000 people on the island 
how many soldiers 
maybe a couple of hundred 
it wouldn t take much more than that
to control a space that small 
you do know that 
great  they ve got a small army 
what do we got 
four and a half men 
that smells disgusting 
disgusting  chicken gumbo is bad 
but eating on rats and gorilla nipples 
that s delicious 
not so funny 
  i need a raise 
  why 
i need more money for my son 
i want to send him to a better school 
  did yin yang get a family 
  i have no idea 
you don t ask  i don t tell 
anyway  the pay share stays the same 
that s the way it s gonna be 
now the target on this island
is a guy named general garza 
  what s the problem 
  who gives a shit what the problem is 
we got enough problems
right here of our own 
we don t get rid of those first 
they re gonna get rid of us 
toll road  when was
the last time you saw your analyst 
  this morning 
  yeah  what d you talk about 
avoidant personality disorder 
you think too much 
you know  toll road  you re a great guy 
a little fucked up  no doubt about it 
and you re always gonna have
unusual problems  right 
  yeah 
  you re talking about my ear 
come on  don t start with the ear again 
  not the ear story 
  the ear story  not again 
  we all know the ear story 
  we don t want to hear the ear story 
  we all know i wrestled in college 
  right 
a common injury associated with that sport
is trauma to the ear  a clot 
which  if left unattended 
causes a contraction in the cartilage
and forms cauliflower ears 
my college roommate used to bring up
my ear configuration all the time 
parties  social events  you name it 
that didn t really bother me all that much
because he s usually bragging about
how my ears are a badge of courage 
  made me a little less self conscious 
  of course it would 
but that was short lived 
one morning  during spring break 
i hear him on the phone  bagging on me 
talking about my  queer ear  
you see something funny 
sorry  go ahead 
so i realize i d become the brunt of a joke
simply because i look a little bit different 
so i decided to educate my roommate
on the common decency that should be
afforded people who look a little different 
i smashed him upside his goddamn head 
several times 
until he had a little cluster
of cauliflower all his own 
  and your point is 
  it ain t easy being green 
the fuck you think i m talking about 
anyway  me and christmas
are gonna head down to vilena
and scout the island
to see if we should take the job 
how much we get paid 
i need more money for my family 
what fucking family are you talking about 
my family 
you know  don t ask 
listen  that girl wasn t your type 
her loss  right 
i should have broke that bastard s jaw 
maybe you were lucky 
he could have broke yours 
  impossible 
  you know  christmas  i understand 
but let s just say you were with her
for a couple of hours 
and it s nice  and it s hot and heavy 
but after that  think about it 
what do you do for the rest of the day 
she probably did you a favor 
now you have more time
to feel sorry for yourself 
you re a bleak bastard 
morning  morning 
morning  speak english 
big plane  huh 
yeah  we use it to transport
injured animals 
  why are you here 
  ornithologists 
we re photographing exotic birds 
you re nervous 
nervous 
no  why 
you just look nervous 
i m not nervous  do i look nervous 
your skin looks a little dry 
that s because of the altitude 
well  it s not the altitude 
you fly with the window open all the time 
  dehydration 
  yeah  it is dehydration 
but there s ways to get around that 
there s new skin  it s like stem cell research 
you are looking handsome 
don t worry about it 
  you re jealous 
  i m a little jealous  yeah

no  that s the point  you know 
you think you know someone 
and you truly do not 
aren t you the guy who said 
 the man who best gets along with women
 is the man who can
get along without them  
no  no  you re so not listening 
i m talking about when you give all
the control to the woman 
  you relinquish the power 
  right 
  you give it all to the girl 
  right 
right at that very moment is the time
that she will tear out your heart 
she ll screw the milkman 
she ll get pregnant with a stranger 
i m telling you 
it s exactly what s happening
and it s repeating itself
every relationship i have 
it s the same

buda and pest  nice 
did you do all these 
yes  take one 
a gift 
i don t take free gifts 
  how much you want for it 
  nothing 
taking money for something is not a gift 
taking nothing for something is 
is it like this all the time 
this place was a beautiful place 
then one day  they came with money 
and general garza sold his soul 
and people who fight back are killed 
you said  they  came with money 
who s  they  
some americans  that s all i know 
but someday all of this will change back 
you really believe that 
yes 
you have a family  sandra 
my mother  when i was little  she died 
and my father  he s gone  too 
do you 
  me 
  yes 
he has a truck and a seaplane 
sandra  how close

the palace  why 
we just wanna check out the view 
there is no view 
why don t we just go there anyway  okay 
where is my grove 
where is your manpower 
do you know how long it takes
for a coca field to produce 
of course you don t  let me tell you 
we are eight weeks behind schedule 
kick your peasants  asses 
get me my product 
when you talk like this to me
in front of my men  it s no good 
i am your lifeline 
i am the one who coordinates
all this confusion 
i am making you rich 
and being wealthy is very good 
it allows people to be the real asswipes
nature intended them to be 
sometimes things
are just not worth the money 
sure they are 
sandra  i was wondering about something
you were saying 
  from a female point of view   
  what are you doing 
conversing  look it up 
out of curiosity 
you ever have a person you liked
disrespect you in a bad way 
dis   
i m not sure what the spanish is
for  disrespect  
come on  why don t you man up  jesus 
she wasn t your type 
why don t you just keep saying 
 she wasn t my type  
so i could put a bullet in your bleak brain 
look who i m talking to 
dracula s life coach 
no wonder you re alone 
sandra  are we close 
it s just over there 
  pull over  please 
  yeah  really

  i m glad you asked 
well  i suppose you could say
we like to look at the world
from different views 
you    you got a black heart 
she wasn t your type 
we should get going 
he s very emotional 
what are you looking for 
sandra  how do i know
you re not setting us up 
what does  setting us up  mean 
you don t look like the kind of person
that we deal with all the time 
how did you get involved in this 
an american came here 
he asked my friend to show you around 
he was afraid  so he asked me to 
and you re not afraid 
i m afraid 
but he said maybe you can help vilena 
i don t think so 
why not 
to get this place going again 
you have to rip the guts out of it
and start from the ground up
and even i don t think
that s worth the money 
so if i were you  i d leave  just leave 
you should leave 
don t say anything  let me talk 
run 
  get her 
  got it 
are you crazy 
  you could have killed me 
  you re welcome

  yeah 
  fry and die 
  fry and die  let s do it 
what are they doing 
yes 
great job 
that was a statement 
how did two obvious professionals
pass right through security personnel 
kill 41 soldiers and get away 
with help  that s how 
everything s under control 
except one detail 
a daughter who wants her father
and company dead and gone 
bad shakespeare 
somehow the company parasites got to her 
look  she s your daughter  and that s tragic 
but blood or not  she goes 
call it the price of doing business 
you don t kill your familia 
come around my house
during the holidays  pal 
nice bird 
first of all  i don t feel comfortable
talking business with a giant
carrying a shotgun 
pretty boy wouldn t give it up 
not if you wanna know where they are 
what do you know 
i used to be one of them 
why are you turning on them 
lovers  quarrel 
we settle on 50 
no  math whiz 
we settle on 100 grand 
upfront  in my pocket 
the guy thinks he s a real badass 
actually  i m a horror show 
this geezer s a bloody joke 
life s a joke  gum chew 
i ve been standing in a space
about the size of your mouth for six hours 
if you don t want that fu manchu
knocked back into the  60s 
you d better keep your gum chewing trap
shut and show some respect 
hey 
need a facelift  pretty boy 
bring it 
back off  paine 
i m gonna kill him 
we need him 
back off 
here s what i think is happening 
this guy who calls himself church
is really a front for the cia 
so we re working for the agency 
yeah 
church hired us to take out the general 
but the real target s this guy 
james munroe 
he used to be with the agency 
but got greedy 
went rogue and teamed up with the general
to keep the whole drug operation
for themselves 
and that s a big cash loss 
but church and the agency
can t afford to send in the navy seals
or the special forces
to take out one of their own 
that d be a bad headline 
so they hire us to kill him 
and they re back in business 
  and we re taken out 
  nobody s gonna miss us 
  is it still  5 million 
  you d never live to spend it 
i m telling church the deal s off 
sound about right 
that s about right 
i agree 
you still got the helmet 
where is he 
  who the hell is that 
  some punk 
  don t worry about it 
  we got your back 
if he comes over here  we ll bust his ass 
what do you want 
your life 
i was thinking about taking it 
is that right 
but i don t do so well in tight spaces 
so going to prison worries me 
you shouldn t have bruised her face 
really 
i would have liked to have kept it
the way it was 
keep the bitch   cause i m done with it 
lee 
next time  i ll deflate all your balls  friend 
now you know what i do for a living 
i m not perfect  but you should have waited 
i was worth it 
where is she 
so your daughter paints  too 
this is how it starts 
there s nothing here  let s go 
or how it ends 
what s the matter  barney 
don t you ever sleep 
no  what happened to your girlfriend 
another one bites the dust  brother 
i was gonna paint this for her 
and you know what  i m gonna finish it 
then i m just gonna smash the shit
out of it 
you wanna be alone 
not really  so  what s up 
on this island  there was this girl 
there usually are 
you know  she showed us around 
she was the target s daughter 
and when she had a chance to leave 
she didn t do it 
she had some guts 
why can t i get that out of my mind 
you know  she stands for something 
you know  man  we don t stand for shit 
we used to  but that dried all up 
like this is gonna dry all up 
this here paint is gonna dry 
what dried up 
just belief  man  just the belief in the soul 
just  i don t know 
the human parts  brother 
you remember that time
we was up in bosnia 
we took down them serb bad boys 
all our guys were getting chopped up
all around us 
and there was blood everywhere 
i never thought i was gonna make it
out of there 
  and i know you didn t  either 
  yeah 
kind of feeling like dead  too  you know 
my head s all a very black place 
i don t believe in shit 
just goddamn dracula black 
i remember i got this bottle of the local shit
they have over there  that slivovitz 
i don t know 
i think that s what it was called 
and i ain t feeling no pain now 
and i d come up on this   
i d come up on this old wooden bridge 
and i see this   
i see this   
i see this woman standing there  you know 
and she s   
i stepped out  and she saw me 
and she s just looking right in my eyes 
and i was looking right in her eyes 
i knew what she was gonna do 
she looked at me 
and i knew she was gonna jump 
you know what i did  man 
i just turned around and i kept walking 
until i heard that splash 
then she was gone 
and after taking all them lives 
here was one that i could have saved 
but i didn t 
and what i realized later on was 
if i had saved that woman  i might have 
i don t know 
saved what was left of my soul  you know 
sandra 
short for alexsandra 
which is latin for  defender of mankind  
and  bingo  here you are

and i know you re probably not 
illiteracy being 98  in your country 
try following this 
a very wise dead man once told me
that a real man never strikes a woman 
you push some if you have to 
but you never strike them 
this man  however 
does not share that moral dilemma 
so the question  sandra

again  what did the americans tell you 
who were they after 
continue 
you wanted answers

my life is difficult  i need more money 
why is that 
  i work harder than the rest 
  no  you don t 
yes  i do  because they re taller 
everything is harder for me 
when i get hurt  the wound is bigger
because i m smaller 
when i travel  i need to go farther 
i know   cause you re smaller  right 
yes 
my life is harder than you think 
  i need more money 
  i know  you told me 
for your family  right

gunner

gunner 
hello  karma 
shit 
you shot me 
hey  don t say that 
you were gonna kill him 
no  i was just gonna scare him 
don t say that  you never liked him 
you were gonna kill him 
that s true 
am i dying 
the shot s a couple of inches
above your heart 
gunner  who sent you  who hired you 
who cares 
who cares  i care 
don t go out a total asshole 
for once  cooperate 
who sent you  who hired you 
tell me  let me make it right 
bury me right 
and i want a viking funeral 
you mean where they put you in a boat
and set you on fire  viking 
  that s right 
  you re not a viking 
so what  who cares 
if that s what you want  you got it 
who sent you  is the girl still alive 
come closer 
you know  it s not easy being your friend 
that s true 
man  we ll die with you 
just don t ask us to do it twice 
i know the layout 
i ll tell you about it on the way 
what the hell happened to you 
it s too sad to talk about it 
let s fly 
you know  the enemy s
always been terrified of noise 
especially shotguns 
with this big boy spitting out
250 rounds a minute 
you tell me who s tolerating that 
you know what  i trust you 
i want you to meet my girlfriend 
omya kaboom 
when omya s prime is struck 
she gets off a miniature warhead
that arms itself 
and when that happens 
anything that gets in my lady s way
becomes instant red sauce and jell o 
and if that doesn t work 
her sister will 
so let me get this right 
gunner tries to kill you  you shoot him
and  at death s door 
he gives you the whole layout 
something like that 
but i had to promise him this viking funeral 
you know  where you have to
spread the ashes over the ocean 
what a way to poison
about a thousand whales 
at least 
listen  we owe the big bastard a send off 
  i would have win 
  i know you would have win 
mumbo jumbo  hoodoo lady  hoodoo
boom lay  boom lay  boom lay  boom 
more like a million whales

to take this place down 
i ll take the cellar 
we ve got company 
i got him  you guys take off 
is there a reason you ve taken
the soldiers this man has trained
and made them look like fools 
they look like warriors 
warriors loyal to me 
i thought the people of vilena
hired these mercenaries to kill me 
but then i think maybe this is your plan 
because you cannot control me 
and torturing sandra works for you 
you want to kill her to make me suffer 
a man can never kill a child 
but you can 
you re losing your mind 
you do not control me 
bring sandra here

the agency parasites hired you

to go fishing 
you d have to think
i m pretty freaking stupid
to surrender to the agency 
why would i do that  i created this 
i made it all happen 
and then they wanted me out  why 
because i saw the big picture 
unlike people like her father  you 
the agency 
you see life through a freaking keyhole
because you let emotions
cloud your judgment 
emotions are the cancer of the intellect 
stop walking 
and what about me and you 
we re both the same 
we re both mercenaries 
we re both dead inside 
so why the hell did you come after me
