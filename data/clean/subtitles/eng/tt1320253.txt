you ever hear of an island called vilena
no
yeah
its a little island in the gulf
thats right
you should read more
thanks
there are resources on that island
that my people are very interested in
but a general by the name of garza
has overthrown the halfass government
thats right
my people are having a problem
with this fanatic garza
so you want garza gone
i want him dead
all it takes is a little army
only an idiot would do this job
how much
oh like i said
im busy anyway
so give this job to my friend here
he loves playing in the jungle
right
right
hey why dont we have dinner
sure when
in a thousand years
too soon
whats his fucking problem
he wants to be president
i got to recon this island first
ill have a contact for you on the island
good riddance
i got a feeling everyone else
has passed on this job
so our fee is 5 mil
5 mil
and i want half upfront
and the other half in an offshore account
you got a problem with that
no
what i have a problem with
is people who try to fuck me over
so if you take this money
and you dont deliver
me and my people
are gonna come get you and your people
and chop you up
into little fucking dog treats
you got a problem with that
lets talk
whoever stood you up sounds bad
yeah but it will pay good
yeah well money aside
what happened to your code
what codes that
the target has to deserve it
that was canceled due to lack of interest
youre dark dark and cold
you noticed
and i aint buying into that by the way
you will
stick around young man you will
vilena
next job
they got work there
come on
you know you shouldnt be here gunner
dont replace me

im still good
youre still using
i cant trust you anymore man
you cant trust me
hmm
you cant trust me
i cant
you cant trust me
be careful
you threatening me gunner
nah im a nice guy
so going over the info
this guy church gave me
theres probably about
6000 people on the island
how many soldiers
maybe a couple of hundred
it wouldnt take much more than that
to control a space that small
you do know that
great theyve got a small army
what do we got
four and a half men
that smells disgusting
disgusting chicken gumbo is bad
but eating on rats and gorilla nipples
thats delicious
not so funny
i need a raise
why
i need more money for my son
i want to send him to a better school
did yin yang get a family
i have no idea
you dont ask i dont tell
anyway the pay share stays the same
thats the way its gonna be
now the target on this island
is a guy named general garza
whats the problem
who gives a shit what the problem is
we got enough problems
right here of our own
we dont get rid of those first
theyre gonna get rid of us
toll road when was
the last time you saw your analyst
this morning
yeah whatd you talk about
avoidant personality disorder
you think too much
you know toll road youre a great guy
a little fucked up no doubt about it
and youre always gonna have
unusual problems right
yeah
youre talking about my ear
come on dont start with the ear again
not the ear story
the ear story not again
we all know the ear story
we dont want to hear the ear story
we all know i wrestled in college
right
a common injury associated with that sport
is trauma to the ear a clot
which if left unattended
causes a contraction in the cartilage
and forms cauliflower ears
my college roommate used to bring up
my ear configuration all the time
parties social events you name it
that didnt really bother me all that much
because hes usually bragging about
how my ears are a badge of courage
made me a little less selfconscious
of course it would
but that was shortlived
one morning during spring break
i hear him on the phone bagging on me
talking about my queer ear
you see something funny
sorry go ahead
so i realize id become the brunt of a joke
simply because i look a little bit different
so i decided to educate my roommate
on the common decency that should be
afforded people who look a little different
i smashed him upside his goddamn head
several times
until he had a little cluster
of cauliflower all his own
and your point is
it aint easy being green
the fuck you think im talking about
anyway me and christmas
are gonna head down to vilena
and scout the island
to see if we should take the job
how much we get paid
i need more money for my family
what fucking family are you talking about
my family
you know dont ask
listen that girl wasnt your type
her loss right
i should have broke that bastards jaw
maybe you were lucky
he could have broke yours
impossible
you know christmas i understand
but lets just say you were with her
for a couple of hours
and its nice and its hot and heavy
but after that think about it
what do you do for the rest of the day
she probably did you a favor
now you have more time
to feel sorry for yourself
youre a bleak bastard
morning morning
morning speak english

yeah we use it to transport
injured animals
why are you here
ornithologists
were photographing exotic birds
youre nervous

get along without them
no no youre so not listening
im talking about when you give all
the control to the woman

right at that very moment is the time
that she will tear out your heart

this place was a beautiful place
then one day they came with money
and general garza sold his soul

when you talk like this to me
in front of my men its no good
i am your lifeline
i am the one who coordinates
all this confusion
i am making you rich
and being wealthy is very good
it allows people to be the real asswipes
nature intended them to be
sometimes things
are just not worth the money

sandra i was wondering about something
you were saying
from a female point of view
what are you doing
conversing look it up
out of curiosity
you ever have a person you liked
disrespect you in a bad way
dis
im not sure what the spanish is
for disrespect

yeah really
where is he going
im glad you asked
well i suppose you could say

from different views
you you got a black heart
she wasnt your type
we should get going
hes very emotional
what are you looking for
sandra how do i know
youre not setting us up
what does setting us up mean
you dont look like the kind of person
that we deal with all the time
how did you get involved in this
an american came here
he asked my friend to show you around
he was afraid so he asked me to
and youre not afraid
im afraid
but he said maybe you can help vilena
i dont think so
why not
to get this place going again
you have to rip the guts out of it
and start from the ground up
and even i dont think
thats worth the money
so if i were you id leave just leave
you should leave
dont say anything let me talk
run
get her
got it
are you crazy

with help thats how
everythings under control
except one detail
a daughter who wants her father
and company dead and gone
bad shakespeare
somehow the company parasites got to her
look shes your daughter and thats tragic
but blood or not she goes
call it the price of doing business
you dont kill your familia
come around my house
during the holidays pal
nice bird
first of all i dont feel comfortable
talking business with a giant
carrying a shotgun
pretty boy wouldnt give it up
not if you wanna know where they are
what do you know
i used to be one of them
why are you turning on them
lovers quarrel
we settle on 50
no math whiz
we settle on 100 grand
upfront in my pocket
the guy thinks hes a real badass
actually im a horror show
this geezers a bloody joke
lifes a joke gumchew
ive been standing in a space
about the size of your mouth for six hours
if you dont want that fu manchu
knocked back into the 60s
youd better keep your gumchewing trap
shut and show some respect
hey
need a facelift pretty boy
bring it
back off paine
im gonna kill him
we need him
back off
heres what i think is happening
this guy who calls himself church
is really a front for the cia
so were working for the agency
yeah
church hired us to take out the general
but the real targets this guy
james munroe
he used to be with the agency
but got greedy
went rogue and teamed up with the general
to keep the whole drug operation
for themselves
and thats a big cash loss
but church and the agency
cant afford to send in the navy seals
or the special forces
to take out one of their own
thatd be a bad headline
so they hire us to kill him
and theyre back in business
and were taken out
nobodys gonna miss us
is it still 5 million
youd never live to spend it
im telling church the deals off
sound about right
thats about right
i agree
you still got the helmet
where is he
who the hell is that
some punk
dont worry about it
we got your back
if he comes over here well bust his ass
what do you want
your life
i was thinking about taking it
is that right
but i dont do so well in tight spaces
so going to prison worries me
you shouldnt have bruised her face
really
i would have liked to have kept it
the way it was
keep the bitch cause im done with it
lee
next time ill deflate all your balls friend
now you know what i do for a living
im not perfect but you should have waited
i was worth it
where is she
so your daughter paints too
this is how it starts
theres nothing here lets go
or how it ends
whats the matter barney
dont you ever sleep
no what happened to your girlfriend
another one bites the dust brother
i was gonna paint this for her
and you know what im gonna finish it
then im just gonna smash the shit
out of it
you wanna be alone
not really so whats up
on this island there was this girl
there usually are
you know she showed us around
she was the targets daughter
and when she had a chance to leave
she didnt do it
she had some guts
why cant i get that out of my mind
you know she stands for something
you know man we dont stand for shit
we used to but that dried all up
like this is gonna dry all up
this here paint is gonna dry
what dried up
just belief man just the belief in the soul
just i dont know
the human parts brother
you remember that time
we was up in bosnia
we took down them serb bad boys
all our guys were getting chopped up
all around us
and there was blood everywhere
i never thought i was gonna make it
out of there
and i know you didnt either
yeah
kind of feeling like dead too you know
my heads all a very black place
i dont believe in shit
just goddamn dracula black
i remember i got this bottle of the local shit
they have over there that slivovitz
i dont know
i think thats what it was called
and i aint feeling no pain now
and id come up on this
id come up on this old wooden bridge
and i see this
i see this
i see this woman standing there you know
and shes
i stepped out and she saw me
and shes just looking right in my eyes
and i was looking right in her eyes
i knew what she was gonna do
she looked at me
and i knew she was gonna jump
you know what i did man
i just turned around and i kept walking
until i heard that splash
then she was gone
and after taking all them lives
here was one that i could have saved
but i didnt
and what i realized later on was
if i had saved that woman i might have
i dont know
saved what was left of my soul you know
sandra
short for alexsandra
which is latin for defender of mankind
and bingo here you are
now thats synergy
youre not following that
and i know youre probably not
illiteracy being 98 in your country
try following this
a very wise dead man once told me
that a real man never strikes a woman
you push some if you have to
but you never strike them
this man however
does not share that moral dilemma
so the question sandra
why were the americans here
dont fight back
just relax
again what did the americans tell you
who were they after
continue
you wanted answers
not like that
whatever you say
im going back to vilena
yeah something change
whats the plan
there is no plan
wait wait wait we need a strategy
im going youre not
what
i said im going you guys arent

speed better than luck
whatever
its difficult
what is
my life is difficult i need more money
why is that
i work harder than the rest
no you dont
yes i do because theyre taller
everything is harder for me
when i get hurt the wound is bigger
because im smaller
when i travel i need to go farther

my life is harder than you think
i need more money
i know you told me

gunner

insect
bail
shit
yang
come out come out wherever you are
its over
lets talk about this
i forgive you yang
that almost hurt
back off
what do you wear size three
bring it happy feet
come on bring it
size matters
gunner
hello karma
shit
you shot me
hey dont say that
you were gonna kill him
no i was just gonna scare him
dont say that you never liked him
you were gonna kill him
thats true
am i dying
the shots a couple of inches
above your heart
gunner who sent you who hired you
who cares
who cares i care
dont go out a total asshole
for once cooperate
who sent you who hired you
tell me let me make it right
bury me right
and i want a viking funeral
you mean where they put you in a boat
and set you on fire viking
thats right
youre not a viking
so what who cares
if thats what you want you got it
who sent you is the girl still alive
come closer
you know its not easy being your friend
thats true
man well die with you
just dont ask us to do it twice
i know the layout
ill tell you about it on the way
what the hell happened to you
its too sad to talk about it
lets fly
you know the enemys
always been terrified of noise
especially shotguns
with this big boy spitting out
250 rounds a minute
you tell me whos tolerating that
you know what i trust you
i want you to meet my girlfriend
omya kaboom
when omyas prime is struck
she gets off a miniature warhead
that arms itself
and when that happens
anything that gets in my ladys way
becomes instant red sauce and jello
and if that doesnt work
her sister will
so let me get this right
gunner tries to kill you you shoot him
and at deaths door
he gives you the whole layout
something like that
but i had to promise him this viking funeral
you know where you have to
spread the ashes over the ocean
what a way to poison
about a thousand whales
at least
listen we owe the big bastard a sendoff
i would have win
i know you would have win
mumbo jumbo hoodoo lady hoodoo
boomlay boomlay boomlay boom
more like a million whales
its 336 we have 20 minutes
to take this place down
ill take the cellar
weve got company
i got him you guys take off
is there a reason youve taken
the soldiers this man has trained
and made them look like fools
they look like warriors
warriors loyal to me
i thought the people of vilena
hired these mercenaries to kill me
but then i think maybe this is your plan
because you cannot control me
and torturing sandra works for you
you want to kill her to make me suffer
a man can never kill a child
but you can
youre losing your mind
you do not control me
bring sandra here
bring her now or i will kill you
