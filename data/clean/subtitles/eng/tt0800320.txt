when titans ruled the earth 
the titans were powerful   
   but their reign was ended
by their own sons   
   zeus  poseidon and hades 
zeus convinced his brother hades   
   to create a beast so strong
it could defeat their parents 
and from his own flesh   
   hades gave birth
to an unspeakable horror   
   the kraken 
zeus became king of the heavens 
poseidon  king of the seas 
and hades  tricked by zeus   
   was left to rule the underworld
in darkness and in misery 
it was zeus who created man   
   and man s prayers
fed the gods  immortality 
but in time  mankind grew restless 
they began to question the gods   
   and  finally  rise up against them 
into this world  a child was born 
a boy who would change everything 
shh  shh 
perseus 
what is it  son 
i ll have a brother or a sister soon 
think we re gonna love this child
differently to the way we love you 
no  we won t 
this child will be yours 
me   
   i m no one s son 
i am your father  perseus 
marmara is your mother 
and you ll always be our son 
the bond between us
is much more than flesh and bone 
the love we have for you   
   it s that love that gods and kings
fight over 
i ve never understood the gods 
but even i don t question
that you were saved for a reason 
and some day   
   that reason is gonna take you
far away from here 
but not tonight  eh 
perseus  perseus 
getting frail  old man 
marmara  marmara 
another day  nothing 
caught on the reef 
to whom do i direct our gratitude
for this glorious bounty 
spyros  please 
poseidon  zeus 
who do i thank  marmara 
  thank the men who provoke them 
  they crush my island 
they put a plague on yours 
they take from us what they want 
we re their slaves 
the gods gave us life 
  for that  we should be thankful 
  i m tired of being thankful for scraps 
i m a fisherman  perseus is a fisherman 
they ve even taken that away from us 
what we are 
still they want us to love them anyway 
one day   
   somebody s gonna have to
make a stand 
one day  somebody s gonna have to say 
 enough   
just like the day you came to me 
the storm brought me right to you 
i know you have questions  son 
i wish i had the answers 
i have everything i need   
   right here 
good night  son 
hold her steady 
tekla  the wreath 
fetch the wreath 
the statue of zeus  magnificent 
something isn t right 
the soldiers  what are they doing 
come on 
lift it 
hang on 
in the name of the king and queen 
who are they 
soldiers from argos 
what have they done 
they ve declared war 
war against the gods 
  let s turn the boat around 
no 
do nothing 
behind you 
hold on 
tekla 
where s the boy 
tekla 
no 
go 
  no 
no 
zeus  you must bring an end
to this  they attack our temples 
now they dare to desecrate zeus  image 
we could reach out to them 
an accommodation could be made 
a truce 
no 
i created them   
   and they reward my love with defiance 
there will be no truce 
finally 
some rage from you 
how long has it been 
how long  brother   
   since you ve seen my face 
hades 
endless years 
i ve watched from the underworld   
   and saw your wrath
tempered with love 
you created them for one reason   
   so their prayers
would fuel our immortality 
but you love them too well 
they ve grown strong 
and now i am forced to rise
because we are all threatened 
what do you want  brother 
let me loose upon them 
they will pray again   
   and you will bathe in their awe
and fear 
and we will grow strong again 
he belongs in the underworld  not here 
you do not tell me where i belong 
you say it is love that feeds us 
but you depend on their love 
i ve only learned to live on their fear   
   their pain 
zeus  our brother speaks the truth 
hear him 
go  do what you will 
father  we need the mortals 
no  apollo 
hades is right 
their insolence has a price 
like children  they need to be
reminded of the order of things 
set an example  brother 
turn them on each other   
   and back into our arms 
  are we the last boat to come in 
no  captain 
you re the only one 
is he one of ours 
no  we found him off paxos
amongst our dead 
he was the only survivor 
let the palace figure out
what to do with him 
squad by four 
go on 
because if we show the gods our love   
   they shall show us love in return 
they shall 
they gave us the corn in the fields 
the sun in the sky 
these are all gifts given to us 
gifts can be taken away 
this will be taken away   
   if we do not pay love to our gods 
if we do not  we stay in filth and misery 
which we have brought upon ourselves 
move  out of the way 
our gods  we beg for the whip   
the beauty and clarity of servitude 
man cannot rule man  you defy the gods
and you will be punished 
is this all there is 
we lost many men  your majesty   
   but we have victory 
to king kepheus  to queen cassiopeia 
no 
to you   
   our mighty legion 
our heroes who have dared
to strike a blow at the heart of zeus 
the temples are burning 
the statues have fallen 
we have starved them of our prayers 
tonight   
   after a generation of struggle   
   the sun does not set over the ocean 
it sets on olympus itself 
a new era has begun 
the era of man 
that frown doesn t suit you  andromeda 
have something to drink 
you ll feel more lively 
andromeda 
what s your name 
perseus 
take this 
please drink 
hands off 
enough 
our daughter  the missionary 
have you seen what s happening
out there 
have you even bothered to look 
we serve as an inspiration 
hundreds of our men
have lost their lives   
   yet we celebrate 
you provoke the gods and you act
as if there will be no consequence 
well  what do you want 
should we be afraid 
should we be trembling
and soiling ourselves in fear 
the gods need us 
they need our worship 
what do we need of them 
  look at my daughter 
  don t 
what could be more
divine than her face 
more beautiful
than all the women of greece 
more beautiful than aphrodite herself 
the olympians should envy her 
  we are the gods now 
  my queen  you re making a spectacle 
interesting 
you 
you are specks of dust
beneath our fingernails 
your very breath is a gift from olympus 
you have insulted powers
beyond your comprehension 
who are you 
i am hades 
kneel 
not now  perseus 
you will have your chance 
what do you know of beauty 
what is more beautiful than death 
gaze upon me  mortal queen 
mother 
princess 
in 10 days   
   when the sun is eclipsed   
   i will unleash the kraken 
argos will be swept from the earth   
   and all of you with it 
unless   
   you sacrifice the princess   
   you so foolishly compare to the gods 
only her blood will sate the kraken   
   and zeus   
   who you have so offended 
choose your penance  argos 
destruction or sacrifice 
this is the will of zeus 
the will of your father 
there is a demigod in argos 
that is impossible 
he s yours 
his name is perseus 
we could offer him sanctuary 
have i heard his prayers 
this son knows no love for me 
he s no different from any of the others
who have turned their backs on us 
for the last time  demigod  speak 
  i m not a demigod 
  who are you  why were you sent 
i don t know 
i advise against this  sire 
  he s not to be trusted 
  what would you have me do  draco 
leave him 
is it possible 
if it s true you are the son of zeus   
   you can save us 
you must save us 
i can t save you  i m just a man 
my lord  as terrible as it is
to utter the words   
   a sacrifice is the only way 
don t even say the word 
he s right 
no one should have to die for me 
let perseus go 
sire  we need to get the princess
out of the city now 
  i ll find a place to hide her 
  you can t hide from hades 
so says the bastard son of a god 
my father   
   was killed by a god 
my mother  sister   
   everyone i loved was killed by a god 
i mend nets   
   not wield a sword 
so  demigod  you have a visitor 
she says she knows you 
my name is lo  perseus 
and how do you know me 
i ve watched you all your life 
i guided you to your family 
are you a god 
there are gods and there are men   
   and there are those of us
who are in between 
many years ago   
   i refused a god s advance 
i was cursed with agelessness 
that s not much of a curse 
i ve lived for years
watching my loved ones die 
i imagine you re sympathetic
to that plight 
is it true 
am i the son of zeus 
yes 
the story of your birth
began with the rebellion of king acrisius 
mankind had grown tired
of the gods  mistreatment and cruelty 
acrisius led a siege on olympus 
it is said the other gods   
   wanted to simply lay waste to acrisius
and his army   
   but zeus loved man too much 
instead  he chose to make an example
of acrisius 
he disguised himself as the king   
   and visited the chamber
where the king s wife was sleeping 
my king 
zeus 
acrisius grew mad with rage 
he ordered the execution of his wife   
   and zeus  newborn son 
i curse you  zeus 
i deny you the body you soiled   
   and the bastard child with it 
no 
the queen and her child
were cast into the sea 
your mother was killed  but you   
   part man  part god  you lived 
i ve watched over you ever since   
   waiting for the day when you will help
bring an end to the tyranny of the gods 
you were born to kill the kraken 
i don t know why i was born   
   or what i am 
but i know it s not the kraken
i wanna kill 
how do i get to hades 
if the kraken falls   
   hades will be weak enough
for you to strike a deathly blow 
only then will you have the revenge
you seek 
then they better release me 
if the kraken can be killed   
   the stygian witches will know how 
the witches are further away
than the legion has ever been 
no man can go there 
no man 
keep your distance  lo 
zeus  forgive us for these affronts
and protect us 
and you still believe
they re going to help 
this is suicide 
and the shields  come on  boys 
it s a lost cause 
we ve no chance  and you know it 
here s who you drew into this  perseus 
an honor guard 
young men who look good
on a reviewing stand   
   and old soldiers 
heading towards retirement 
do you know what the kraken is 
the kraken is the end of us 
a colossal  elemental beast 
it doesn t think  it doesn t feel 
even the gods fear it 
  and you  you re going to kill it 
  don t come 
  i don t need your help 
  of course not 
you re the son of zeus 
  but we have orders 
come  we need to leave 
gentlemen  may our journey be long 
filled with agony and torment   
   and may we all complain about it
bitterly as old men 
  so what should we bring 
  bring everything 
what makes you think the witches
will tell us anything 
oh  they ll tell us  or i ll kill them too 
come on  let s go  boys 
  what is this 
  just leave it 
don t leave us
to the mercy of the gods  please 
don t go  please stay 
stay here  please  please  help us 
you re just going to
make the gods angrier  please 
just sacrifice the princess 
watch your mouth 
stay back  stay back 
you d think they might be thankful 
you cannot desert us 
maybe they re tired of being thankful 
good news 
my brother and i have decided   
  to accompany you on your journey 
  we have enough strangers here 
we can be of great help to you 
trust me  you ll need us 
i need soldiers  not hunters 
which one of your soldiers
knows how to cut the impenetrable skin   
   of the nemean lion 
which one of them knows the soft points
on a centaur s armor 
which one of them knows which jugular
to slice on a five headed hydra 
  the middle one 
  the middle one  good guess 
my brother and i  we know how to kill 
  we enjoy it 
  if you can keep up   
   and you don t mind dying  come along 
it is death who should be afraid of us 
king acrisius 
there is no acrisius 
just calibos 
we have an enemy in common 
  zeus 
  zeus 
my brother 
what do you want from me 
zeus  seed in your wife survived 
the child of your shame 
perseus 
he lives 
you murdered your wife for nothing 
now perseus hurls himself
from argos to destroy me 
he must die 
  what would you have me do 
  zeus must think i serve him   
   but i am growing stronger 
until i possess my full power   
   you will be my weapon 
come 
use this 
kill perseus for me 
and i ll destroy zeus for you 
i serve you 
the boy will die 
how far is it

have you handled a sword before 
  there s been no need 
  i see 
left foot forward 
your motions should be fluid

like the sting on a wasp 
stay focused

keep your balance at all times 
you fall   
   you die 
get up

end of lesson 
perseus 
a gift from the gods 
  forged on olympus

so it s yours 
gentlemen  retrieve our savior 
shh 
the pegasus 
no man has ever ridden one 
it s a message 
they re watching us 
perseus 
perseus 
perseus 
why does it always have to be    
  shh 
listen 
help me 
help me 
you reek of your father 
  who was that 
  i don t know  let s ask him 
let it go 
no  we split up 
just follow the blood 
come on 
look  his blood 
are you happy now

wait  wait 
what is that 
come on 
lxas 
spear 
draco 
faster 
let s go  let s go 
go  jump 
run 
back up  back up  back up 
there s more 
  run 
everyone  back to back 
stand your ground 
three more 
in the name of the gods  they re bigger 
what are they 
djinn 
i fought them in the legion 
this is their desert 
  enemies 
  i thought so 
they aren t human  not anymore 
desert conjurers  cutthroats 
  well  somebody should thank them 
what 
  what is it 
  venom  from hades 
  pray  pray to zeus for strength 
  no  no 
pray to your damn father 
hear my prayer 
protect and heal your son 
  no 
please  zeus  hear me 
would you like some bread 
thank you 
thank you 
  please 
have some bread 
over here  over here 
  for you 
  please 
no 
we must turn our hearts to hades 
it is the only way 
brothers and sisters 
come to me  come 
i have the way out of our misery 
hades has asked for the princess 
sacrifice one for the life of the city 
why do they remain silent
while we suffer 
why do they guard the woman
whose death will save us 
is she better than any one of you 
we have long worshiped zeus in argos 
but it is hades
who now offers us salvation 
we must pray to the one
who showed us our sin   
   and who offers us redemption   
   through blood 
a bribe for the ferryman 
when they get injured in battle   
   they replace their limbs
with charwood and black magic 
they feel no pain 
live hundreds of years 
so how old is that one 
i don t care  i don t trust them 
you re burning 
drink this 
i ll get more water 
come on 
look out 
what 
what s he saying 
the djinn have waited many years for
the one who will free them from the gods 
  he says he is no friend of the humans 
  you don t say 
but the only way we can help perseus
is together 
draco 
look 
together 
  he s not ready to travel 
  time is slipping away  lo 
he may be a demigod 
but he s still mortal 
feeling better 
  yeah  a bit 
  good 
your pride is killing my men 
  you were given gifts  use them 
  those gifts are a trap 
  i don t care what they are  use them 
  no 
i will not use that sword
or anything that they give me 
so we ll just continue to die 
i can t become like them 
if i do this  i do it as a man 
but you are not just a man 
i choose to be 
a man cannot do this  perseus 
according to who 
the gods 
if i had your gifts   
when you need your sword 
it s in my bag 
they re riding them 
they tried to kill us 
i m not getting on it 
magnificent 
what are you waiting for 
well  we need to make up for lost time 
we re making good time 
not good enough 
the eclipse is drawing near 
how close are we to the norn mountains 
it ll be two days
before we reach the witches 
this thing is making me feel sick 
trust me  it s better to be on one
than in one 
what  don t you ever smile 
when i spit in the eyes of the gods   
   then i ll smile 
  what is this place 
  the garden of stygia 
this is where the kraken
defeated the titans 
it s what argos will look like
when we fail 
every step we take
is an insult to the gods 
  good 
  perseus 
only ask what you need to know 
nothing more 
of course 
visitors 
who is it 
visitors 
got the eye 
give it to me 
who is it 
who is it  who is it 
the eye  give it to me 
perseus  no 
we didn t come here to fight 
  we just have one question 
young perseus 
son of zeus 
so fresh 
perseus 
closer 
a little nibble 
  flesh of a god 
flesh of a god 
  witch 
  don t  easy 
stale meat  ladies 
so which one s
gonna answer my question 
you want to know about the kraken 
kraken 
do it 
  kill it 
  that s right 
a wasted journey 
the kraken fears no weapon 
it must have a weakness 
maybe 
but knowledge demands payment 
  sacrifice 
sacrifice 
eusebios 
watch out 
look out 
lxas  shoot 
help 
the eye 
let him go  do it 
you wouldn t dare 
we cannot see the answers
without the eye 
let him go 
now answer the question 
how do we kill the kraken 
  there is a solution 
solution 
but it is an impossible one 
  yeah 
  the gorgon  medusa 
medusa 
anything of flesh is killed by her gaze 
killed by her 
  her prison lies across the river styx   
  at the edge of the underworld 
a titan against a titan 
she s no use against the kraken 
we can t control her 
then we take her head 
clever boy 
  now the eye  give us the eye 
  the eye 
  the eye 
where is it 
but wait  there s more 
don t you want to know more 
perseus  no 
tell him 
tell him 
what 
your journey does not end well 
fate has spoken 
you will die  son of zeus 
it s a lie  come 
written as history 
perseus 
you will die 
why are the djinn leaving us 
they believe we will all die 
it s the prophecy 
who are you 
well  you can call me  father    
  if you wish 
  my father s dead 
he was killed by a god 
an unfortunate casualty
in a war men brought on themselves 
men didn t murder my family 
your brother did 
you heard the witches  prophesy 
you will not defeat the kraken 
much less hades 
if you continue this journey 
you will die  and argos will still fall 
if you re so sure  why are you here 
to offer you sanctuary 
your blood is mine  perseus 
and that makes you a god 
it s time you came to olympus
and started living like one 
rather die in the mud with those men
than live forever as a god 
you foolish boy 
man s entire existence
is a gift of my grace 
for someone who created man   
   you don t know much about us 
we live   
   we fight and we die   
   for each other  not for you 
tell hades i ll see him soon 
  i will not make this offer again 
  good 
because i d hate to refuse you twice 
perseus 
wait 
it s expensive where you re going 
kucuk fashioned this shield
from the scorpioch 
stronger and lighter than any metal 
very rare and high quality item 
we can fight anywhere   
   but not in the underworld 
yeah 
good luck  fisherman 
we all heard what the witches said 
but we can prove them wrong 
i need your help 
it wasn t the gods
that saved me up there 
if you believe that we have a chance 
i never liked argos much anyway 
i know the way 
then we go to the underworld 
we kill medusa 
now what 
  we wait for charon 
charon only ferries the dead 
any volunteers 
heads we swim 
a bribe for the ferryman 
so  what happens when we get there 
just another beast to kill 
a beast 
medusa was beautiful once 
so beautiful as to tempt poseidon 
when he came for her   
   she ran to athena s temple thinking
that the goddess would protect her 
she didn t 
poseidon took her on the cold floor 
she prayed to athena for comfort   
   but the goddess felt nothing
but disgust 
she made sure
no one would ever want medusa again 
one look at the creature she has become
will turn any living thing to stone 
i cannot assist you there 
a curse prevents me 
it was athena s one bit of solace to medusa
so that medusa would never harm a woman 
only men are allowed in the temple 
though no man has ever made it out 
medusa s got a tail
and that s how she ll use it 
listen 
hear her muscles coil 
smell her skin 
feel her hunger in your gut 
medusa s killed you twice now 
do you think she ll hand you her head 
she won t be gracious about it 
one look in her eyes
and you ll turn to stone 
good 
  try not to enjoy this so much 
  i m trying to help you live 
don t look at me 
ease your storm 
we re nearing medusa s lair 
i never thought i could reach this place 
who d you lose 
my daughter 
taken away on her 16th birthday 
dragged down here 
i have a feeling i ll see her soon 
you brought us this far 
let s go the rest of the way 
  how many coins did you get  perseus 
  just the one 
i only knew one great man in my life 
my father 
now i know four more 
and a woman 
and whatever the hell you are 
i know we re all afraid 
but my father told me 
someday someone was gonna have to
take a stand 
someday someone
was gonna have to say   enough   
this could be that day 
trust your senses 
and don t look this bitch in the eye 
  doesn t really inspire confidence 
  quiet 
  listen 
eusebios 
keep your eyes down 
here we go 
solon 
keep going 
flank her 
  draco 
  go 
eusebios  follow me 
hang on 
eusebios 
remember what perseus said 
eyes down 
lxas  no 
eyes down 
where are you 
where are you 
eusebios 
go 
wait here 
i ll lure her out 
get ready 
now 
together 
let them know men did this 
just you and me  son of zeus 
perseus 
don t become one of them 
lo  i m here 
there s no time 
the eclipse 
perseus  you must go
before it s too late 
i m not going anywhere 
my fate is certain 
but the fate of argos
is still in your hands 
all my life you ve been there 
you never left me 
i can t leave you 
this part of the journey
you must do alone 
perseus   
   you re not just part man  part god   
   you re the best of both 
everything will be all right 
brother 
it is time for the mortals to pay 
my child waits to do your will 
leave us 
release the kraken 
the kraken comes now 
our suffering ends
when the beast is sated 
will it take us   
   or will it take andromeda 
andromeda 
it s my name they re calling 
this cannot continue 
stay back 
stay back 
look  the kraken  help us 
andromeda 
hades  we sacrifice our princess
in your name 
it comes  brothers and sisters 
argos has fallen 
do you feel stronger  brother 
you thought the kraken
would bring you their prayers 
but the kraken is my child 
it feeds only me 
i command olympus 
remember who you serve 
i serve myself 
i have since you cheated me 
you sent me to the underworld
to be hated   
   while you basked in their love 
we need the love of humans 
no  you need it 
i survive on their fear 
your reign is over  brother zeus 
you ll watch while my blessed avenger
devours their hopes 
and then finally you ll know my pain 
there is still a demigod in argos   
   brother 
perseus 
the bag  come on 
hyah 
hey  fisherman 
come on 
no 
i m a god 
i will live forever 
but not here 
the boats are coming for us 
for you  not for me 
you won t stay  will you 
perseus  argos needs a ruler 
i cannot be a king 
i serve you better as a man 
you ll make a fine queen for them 
olympus owes you a debt of gratitude 
as do i 
hades lives 
he s just sent back to the underworld 
biding his time  no doubt 
waiting for men to grow weak 
and in their weakness  he grows stronger 
it s mankind who holds the key
to hades  rise 
it always was 
so we ll see him again 
yes 
but now the world knows
a man can stop him 
of course  you had some help 
a sword  the pegasus   
i wanted men to worship us again 
but i didn t want it to cost me a son 
that s almost human of you 
i don t suppose you ll reconsider my offer
to take your place as one of us 
i ve got everything i need right here 
you may not want to be a god  perseus   
   but after feats like yours 
men will worship you 
be good to them
