that came could play 
but now this 
this equipment s
kind of had it  miss 
you re damn right 
mr  buttermaker 
this is normally
a six team league  not seven 
you re gonna have to
be happy with what s left 
look  buttermaker  the problem
is your friend whitewood 
he could have got those boys
in any of the other leagues 
why did he sue this one 
we re different
than the other leagues 
and he knows it 
we run a highly
competitive program here 
i mean  it s
highly competitive 
want to know
something 
  it s not us 
it s the boys 
it s the boys themselves
that want it that way 
buttermaker  new rule book

my dad s been
a yankee fan all his life 
he never heard of no buttermaker
who ever played for the yankees
let alone pitched a no hitter 
i don t know who you are 
but sit down and shut up 
can i play second or third base 
the situation
with the glasses is   
forget about the glasses 
all right  guys 
let s get one thing straight 
i was a heck of a ballplayer 
but i never pitched
for the yankees   
you never played
in the major leagues 
but you did pitch
for phoenix in the minors 
in 1951  you won nine games 
lost six  had 170 strikeouts 
and had an e r a  of 2 86 
good work  kid 
ahmad abdul raheem 
ahmad abdul raheem

like my big brothers 
and i want to play
where hank aaron played 
right field 
aaron played right field 
then right field 
he also played quite
a few games on second base 
then second base 
mike engelberg 
my dad thinks i should
try out for catcher 
he can play third and short
at the same time 
keep it up  whitewood

engelberg 
what 
that is a bunt   
b u n t 
the catcher is supposed
to pick up the bunt   
and throw it
to first base 
how was i supposed to know 
you made such a big deal
yelling out to them 
diversionary tactic  engelberg 
now get the ball 
why are you always
picking on me 
what did i do to you 
quit your bellyaching and
throw the ball to first base 
 glass breaking 
   boy 
estupido 
  don t blame me 
i didn t even know
it was your car 
it s dumb  parking it
so close to the field anyway 
all right  boys 
let s get back to basics 
this is a baseball 
the object of the game
is to keep the baseball   
within the confines
of the playing field 
 wait a minute 
you don t think
we know what a ball is 
i don t think i like
that kind of talk 
he s been in enough
fights this week already 
  we keep playing like this 
we ll be the laughingstock
of the league 
what do you expect 
all we got on this team   
is a bunch of jews 
spics  niggers  pansies 
and a booger eating
moron 
tanner  you should be
reminded from time to time   
that you re one of the few
people on this team   
who s not a jew 
spic  nigger  pansy 
or booger eating moron 
so you better cool it 
or we may be disposed
to beat the crap out of you 
  oh  yeah 
  yeah 
cut it out 
now  guys  somebody s gonna
pay for this windshield 
and i think  engelberg 
it s gonna be your father 
bullshit 
   honking 
come on  babe 
we were supposed
to be here by 7 30 
isn t that something 
it looks like a baseball field 
they did a nice job 
didn t they 
i had them
leave off the anchovies   
because i didn t know
whether to use them
as bats or the baseline 
besides  most people don t like
the taste of anchovies 
i don t like them 
you see 
carol  where is frank 
is he still practicing 
of course 
you got to keep after him 
you all look terrific 
all right  everybody be patient 
pizza s on very  very soon

different businesses

they were tough chances 
the sun was in your eyes 
don t give me any
of your honky bullshit 
buttermaker 
i know they were easy 
let s not bring race
into this  ahmad 
we got enough problems
as it is 
anyway  your brothers
will understand 
no  they won t 
they would never
make flubs like that 
they were all big athletes 
when they were my age 
they were captains
of all their teams   
and great players 
and i m not 
i m lousy at football 
basketball and baseball 
i m quitting
the whole damn thing 
thank god hank aaron

you know what
i m talking about 
what are
you talking about 
the 42 errors 
42 errors 
come off it  will you  ahmad 
stop pulling my leg 
you know what i m talking about 
you know all about hank aaron 
his first year in sandlot ball 
he committed 42 errors 
he was 9 years old 
broke his little heart 
he damn near quit 
thank god for us
he didn t 
there d be no
great old number 44 
buttermaker  you re so full of   
it s common knowledge 
for crying out loud 
ask ogilvie 
i m surprised
you didn t know that 
he s your favorite player too 
well 
 sigh 
kind of ruins my plans 
i was thinking
around the fourth game 
you d be switch hitting 
i figured with your speed
and right side of the plate 
those few extra steps you get 
you d be a tough out 
you know  bunts 
things like that 
i am kind of fast  huh 
you re very fast 
 man on p a  
at present there are at least
two to three instances   
of cardiac arrest
or heart seizure at every major
sports event at the coliseum   
you re two and a half
hours late 
i told you to meet me
in my office 
i couldn t find it 
jesus  i couldn t
believe that score    26 0 
what a beating 
my son wouldn t come out
of his room all weekend 
that s why i want
to disband the team 
have you told the boys yet 
not yet 
i was hoping to sneak away
from the office this afternoon
and drop by the field 
actually  it might be better
if you told them yourself 
i mean 
they really do like you 
and  uh  i d appreciate it 
what if the boys
don t want to quit 
that s not important 
this has been very humiliating 
we ve put these boys
in a situation
they just can t handle 
i hope you think that s fair 
mr  harrison is here
with his 2 30 appointment   
about the police
academy bill

all right  all right 
i m an asshole 
go ahead and yell 
get it off your chests 
i deserve it 
we really appreciate
these new uniforms  buttermaker 
but we re not going to be
needing them anymore 
we ve been taking a lot
of razzing in school
about opening day  and   
and they were
laughing at us 
picking on us 
anyway  we took a vote
and decided that we d quit 
what the hell happened
to you  tanner 
 engelberg 
tanner got into a fight
because of it 
who with 
the seventh grade 
what 
the seventh grade 
you took on
the whole seventh grade 
you want to quit  tanner 
crud  no 
i want to play ball 
i can understand
how you guys feel 
i haven t been
much of a manager   
or much of anything else 
for that matter 
and i m sorry 
but this quitting thing   
it s a hard habit to break
once you start 
you re a damn
good bunch of boys 
you probably deserved
a lot better than me 
but we re stuck
with each other 
jimmy  grab a bat 
engelberry  get your gear on 
get behind home plate 
what for 
we need to practice 
  but we disbanded the team 
we took a vote 
goddamn it

your fat ass behind the plate
before i kick it up there 
and the rest of you pansy ass
quitters  move your asses
before i kick them all

only one thing   
bad news
for the athletics

way to go  jimmy 
  good hit 
way to go 
no  tanner  no 
everybody watch this 
you get down
on your left knee there 
so if you miss the ball 
it hits your body 
you can still make the play 
up  everybody 
all right  engelberry 
hit it again 
that s it 
that s the way to do it 
you see how easy it is 
you see how simple that is 
you just get down
on your left knee 
you miss the ball 
it hits your body 
you still make the play 
you understand 
okay  let s
do it again 
 yelling 
a busted bat
and a long fly ball   
any day now
durocher will call 
  ooh 
shit

heart attack time

councilman whitewood
told the league committee
he s calling it quits 
he is  we aren t 
what are you 
one of those sadists
or something 
didn t those kids take enough
of a beating on opening day 
what the hell you trying to do 
win the pennant 
this schedule says
that on the last day
of the season  june 19th 
the two best teams

we intend to be
one of those teams 
be a lot of fun if

several hundred years 
we lost 18 0   buttercrud  
and the athletics are
the worst team in the league 
second worst 
sorry  i forgot 
snap out of it 
nobody said it was
going to be easy 
don t look so glum 
well 
we committed 24 errors 
their pitcher threw
a no hitter against us 
but there is
some good news 
  two of our runners   
almost managed
to get to first base 
and we did hit
17 foul balls 
that s right 
that s the spirit 
cokes and hot dogs on me 
yeah 
this way 
buttermaker  i said
i wasn t interested 
there s nothing to be afraid of 
i m not afraid 
i m just through with
all that tomboy stuff 
baseball s not tomboy stuff 
it s your country s national
pastime  it s healthy 
it s a lot healthier
than sitting around here
on a stupid street corner
selling dumb maps
to a bunch of ignorant hicks 
look at that gut on you 
i beg your pardon 
there isn t an ounce
of fat on me 
there will be if you keep
sitting around here 
this is sure
