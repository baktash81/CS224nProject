and the uncle s pissed off 
she s not married 
divorced with four kids 
i guess father
was helping out 
helping out 
hey  mr  burke 
they re in back talking to the bishop 
and father 
we put him in the break room 
any press 
some guy from the citizen
but we sent him away 
none of the big papers 
let s keep it that way 
who s that 
assistant da 
it s gonna be hard to keep the
papers away from the arraignment 
what arraignment 
you can tell father geoghan
it won t be much longer 
now  sheila  you know what good
work the church does in the community 
but i give you
my personal guarantee
that i m going to take
father out of the parish 
and this will never
happen again 
we ll just be
another moment  paul 
of course  father 
now  sheila  i m going
to give you my personal card   
losing a good reporter
is always tough 
but losing
one of our best   
well  to put it
as eloquently as i can 
it s a real kick in the ass 
but  robby here
has known stewart
longer than most of you
have been alive 
so  i ll hand it off
to him  robby 
oh  well  thanks  ben 
i think 
although i take issue with your
reference to my seniority 
i will say that stewart s departure
is especially painful for me
because  uh   
for what  stewart 
twenty years now 
stewart s been more
than willing to part
with his money
at the poker table 
and i ve got a kid
in college 
yeah  but i m gonna keep playing 
oh  problem solved 
godspeed then 
now  stewart  i find the
timing of your departure
disconcerting 
the corner office sits empty 
the new editor
arrives on monday 
so i m sorry  buddy 
but i gotta ask ya 
what the hell
do you know 
how s the cake 
it s really good 
are you saving yours 
nah  it s for mike 
i can never eat at those things 
they kind of depress me 
i know 
did you see the numbers
from washington 
yeah  very interesting 
i think so  too 
i m not asking if the pd s lying 
i know they re lying 
all i m asking 
who s behind it 
oh  okay  i get it 
you don t want to talk 
no  dan  i m not mad 
i m hungry 
i ve been talking here
so long i didn t eat lunch 
so i m gonna go
get something to eat 
and that ll give you
an hour to decide
whether you want to be
on the right side of this
or read about it
like everybody else 
bye  dan 
you think
cahill has something 
maybe  i just don t think
the story s for us 
ben likes it  yeah  it s not bad 
it s just not spotlight 
what s just not spotlight 
the pd numbers 
the numbers story  it feels thin 
oh  you got cahill to talk 
no  but i will 
good  then we ll know
if it s thin 
  how d it go upstairs 
  oh  okay 
  robby gave a good speech 
  sure he did 
i heard lubin and connor
are going to the times 
  come on  really 
  yeah  i heard that 
they re leeching us 
well  at least they re sending us
a guy from miami to run things 
that should help 
has baron even
spent time in boston 
i don t think he s ever been here before 
maybe we should buy him a map 
i have a friend down in miami
said he cut 15  of the staff 
great   
hey  robby 
new boss coming in
to make some cuts 
i have no idea 
aren t you sitting down
with him 
yes  i am 
so is it about spotlight 
i don t know  mike 
but i do know
that ben needs an answer
on the crime numbers story 
i m telling you 
i really don t think that story s for us 
mr  baron 
walter robinson  robby 
thanks for taking the time
out of your weekend 
oh  my pleasure 
appreciate it 
what are you reading 
uh   
the curse of the bambino 
oh  yeah 
it s a great book 
the globe has
season tickets at fenway
once you re settled in 
by the way 
thank you 
uh  to be honest 
i m not much of a baseball fan 
i m just trying to
get a feel for the city 
oh  yeah   
so you re originally
from boston 
i am  born and raised  yeah 
a lot of the newsroom
is from here 
it really feels like
a local paper in that way 
and did that change at all after
the paper was sold to the times 
no  no  i don t think
that had a big impact 
good 
and you re an editor
for the spotlight team 
i d prefer to think of myself
as player coach  but yes 
are you familiar
with spotlight 
no  not particularly 
well  we are a four person
investigative team 
we report to
ben bradlee  jr  
and we keep
our work confidential 
what re you
working on now 
we just put out a piece on a
shoddy construction outfit 
and right now we re really just
trolling around for our next story 
how long does
that typically take 
hard to say 
a couple months 
couple months 
yeah  we don t like to
rush it 
once we settle on a project  we can
spend a year or more investigating it 
is that a concern 
not necessarily 
um  but from what i understand
readership is down 
internet is cutting into
the classified business  and 
i think i m gonna need to
take a hard look at things 
so  do you anticipate
more cuts 
i think it s safe
to assume so 
but what i m more focused on
right now is finding a way
to make this paper
essential to its readers 
i like to think
it already is 
fair enough  i just think
that we can do better 
mr  bradlee 
hey 
saw the pd numbers 
looks interesting 
yeah  there s something there 
how long do you need 
another week 
where re you going 
10 30 
since when 
technically 
i am an editor 
technically 
your sit down with baron
go that well 
i couldn t get a read on him 
that s a first 
how about you 
oh  he s a barrel of laughs 
morning  everyone 
let s get started 
do you wanna
say something  marty 
uh  sure 
uh  hello 
as most of you know by now 
my name is marty baron 
i m delighted to be here 
um  if you could tell me your name
as we go around  that d be helpful 
thank you 
okay  peter 
peter canellos  metro 
i ve got a major
big dig closure 
hey  steve  hey 
mike 
crappy game
last night  huh 
yeah  they can t hit
worth a nickel 
hey listen  what s eileen mcnamara
doing in the 10 30 
do you need something  mike 
no  just curious 
go be curious somewhere else 
i got work to do  huh 
okay  steve 
see you 
yeah 
and it looks like pedro s gonna
be out until september 1st 
jimmy says he ll be back this year 
but the doc didn t seem so sure 
when s the pats  opener 
is that everyone 
yes  that s it 
okay  good 
thank you  uh   
did everyone read
eileen mcnamara s column this weekend 
that s the geoghan case 
yeah  what s the folo
on that 
it s a column  what kind
of folo were you thinking 
uh  well  apparently
this priest molested kids
in six different parishes
over the last 30 years 
and the attorney
for the victims  mr   
garabedian 
thanks  eileen 
mr  garabedian says
cardinal law found out
about it 15 years ago
and did nothing 
yeah  i think that
attorney s a bit of a crank 
and the church
dismissed the claim 
he said  she said 
whether mr  garabedian
is a crank or not
he says he has documents
that prove the cardinal knew 
as i understand it 
those documents are under seal 
okay  but the fact remains 
a boston priest abused 80 kids 
we have a lawyer who says he
can prove law knew about it 
and we ve written all of  uh 
two stories in the last six months 
this strikes me as an essential
story to a local paper 
i think at the very least  we have
to go through those documents 
how would you
like to do that 
oh  uh   
i don t know
what the laws are here 
but in florida
we would go to court 
you want to sue the church 
technically we wouldn t
sue the church 
we d file a motion to lift
the seal on those documents 
the church will read that
as us suing them 
so will everybody else 
good to know 
gutsy call
for the first day 
that s one word for it 
how do you think that s
gonna play down front 
i think gilman s
gonna shit a brick 
hey 
door 
how d it go 
well  baron wants to sue for the
sealed docs in the geoghan case 
wants to sue the church 
hey  that s great 
we covered geoghan when the
story broke three years ago 
baron was still in miami 
i think he might have been
at the times then  actually 
he wasn t here 
so do you think
that suit has a chance 
depends on the judge 
and what parish he belongs to 
bradlee  yeah 
okay 
baron wants to talk to us 
us 
okay  jon  thank you 
yes  okay  thanks 
i ve set up a meeting for
tomorrow with outside counsel 
jon albano 
yeah 
who s the judge
in this case 
um   
constance sweeney 
tough 
why s that 
good catholic girl 
huh 
so  um 
judging from what i ve read 
it doesn t seem like we ve done
a very thorough investigation
into the geoghan case 
is that right 
no  it s not 
we looked hard at geoghan 
david armstrong from metro 
michael paulson for religion 
okay  but  uh 
just so i understand 
beyond our daily coverage 
we haven t   
we haven t committed any long term
investigative resources
to the question of whether or not
cardinal law knew about this 
no  we haven t 
and that s the kind of thing
your team would do 
spotlight  well  yeah 
but we re still prospecting the
boston pd story i told you about 
could you set that aside 
we could 
marty  in past spotlight s
had success in large part
because they pick
their own projects 
would you consider
picking this one 
i don t know if
he s writing about you 
but i will let him know
you called 
okay  bye 
hey 
hey  how d it go 
okay  uh   
baron wants us to scrub
the geoghan case 
that s great 
didn t we cover geoghan 
yeah  there s a lawyer alleging
cardinal law knew about it 
  mmm  mitch garabedian  right 
  yeah 
i covered him
at the courthouse 
can you get to him 
i only interviewed him once 
he s kind of a character 
i like characters 
i ll take him 
good  you take him 
also  we should be
talking to  uh 
the lawyer who repped the
victims in the porter case 
eric macleish 
uh huh 
that guy was always on tv 
yeah  the porter case 
remind me 
yeah  um  father porter  similar story 
molested dozens of kids in
fall river about 10 years ago 
so  we re dropping
the boston pd 
i vote yes 
no  no 
we just gotta set
it aside for now 
listen  i don t need
to tell you guys this 
we need to be more
discreet than usual 
all right 
everybody s gonna be interested in this 
not just the herald 
we can t let cardinal law get wind
of this until we know what we have 
good luck with that 
so when
do you leave  nana 
the bus is picking us up in the
church parking lot at 9 00 
we have 40 people going 
and is father dominic going 
no  he says
he s unlucky 
but luck has nothing
to do with it 
you know  last time nana won  160 
wow 
you gonna tell her 
we don t even know
if there s a story yet 
well   globe sues church  
it s gonna be a story 
hey  lisa  could you pull all the
relevant clips on that for me 
yeah 
is this for spotlight 
just drop them off
when they re ready  thanks 
excuse me  do you know where
the publisher s office is 
will do 
how are you  marty 
settling in 
yeah  i think so 
good 
what can i do for you 
um   
i d like to challenge the protective
order in the geoghan case 
you want to sue
the catholic church 
um   
we re just
filing a motion  but   
yes 
you think
it s that important 
yes  i do 
because obviously the church
will fight us very hard on this 
which won t go unnoticed
by our subscriber base 
53  of them are catholic 
mmm hmm 
i think
they ll be interested 
okay 
marty  lake street
will probably contact you
about a face to face
with the cardinal 
it s customary 
yeah  they already have 
it s set up for next week 
i wouldn t mention this 
hello 
hello 
can i help you 
oh  hi 
i m mike rezendes
from the boston globe 
i m here to see
mitchell garabedian 
he s on a call 
please have a seat 
okay 
all right  i m listening 
go ahead 
okay 
bill  where the hell
are those papers 
i asked you to
put  em on my desk 
the famous walter robinson
in my conference room 
good to see you again  eric 
sacha pfeiffer 
eric macleish 
nice to meet you 
nice to meet you 
you don t play golf 
do you 
uh  no 
good 
your colleague here
took some money off me
at a charity event
last year 
it was a very lucky putt  i actually
had my eyes closed  by the way 
mmm hmm 
so  how can i help
you guys 
uh   
you re familiar
with the geoghan case 
sure 
eighty plaintiffs 
all of them individual cases 
garabedian must be swimming 
well  and the allegations
against cardinal law 
yeah  it s tricky  um   
this is what you need to understand 
these are shitty cases 
the statute of limitations
is only three years 
and most of these victims don t
come forward until long after that 
oh  why is that 
well  they re kids 
you know 
guilt  shame 
and most of these kids come
from tough neighborhoods 
nobody wants to admit
this kind of thing 
so  you re screwed
on the time limit 
and  uh 
even if you argue
your way around that
the charitable immunity statute
caps damages at 20 grand 
twenty grand for
molesting a child 
that is the way
the system is set up  yes 
the church is tough 
so  your best shot
is to try these cases
in the press
like i did on porter 
hmm  but  you know 
most of the victims 
they don t wanna have
anything to do with tv 
and  uh 
mitch isn t exactly
a people person 
yeah  and if garabedian
can t get his victims
to go before the press 
then he s really   
that s right 
he has a long road ahead of him 
my guess is he doesn t
have anything on law 
what  you think
he s bluffing or   
i think he s grandstanding
to cut a better deal 
seems a bit reckless 
have you met
mitch garabedian 
i asked you to write up that motion 
bill  i didn t ask you to file it 
hey  bill  here s
the case files from yesterday 
hi 
who are you 
i m mike rezendes from the boston globe 
i had an appointment
with you about an hour ago 
i can t talk to you 
i m very busy  sharon 
no  no  she went out for coffee 
she said she d be right back 
i m following up
on an article 
the one in the phoenix 
no  in the globe 
did you see
the one in the phoenix 
no  i didn t 
i thought it was very good 
i have a copy here somewhere 
that s all right 
i ll track it down 
i m actually
following up on a column
that eileen mcnamara
wrote about your suit 
suits 
there are 84 of them 
it s not a class action 
you should get your facts straight 
no  you re right  i should 
so i m trying to get some
background information on   
you re not
recording this  are you 
no  i wouldn t do
that without asking 
i can t show you those church s
documents if that s what you re after 
they re under seal 
yeah  i know that 
did you know that
they tried to bring me up
before the massachusetts board
of bar overseers three times 
they re watching me
very closely 
the church 
yeah  the church  yeah 
they d like to get me disbarred 
in fact  put that away 
put it away 
sure 
i don t want you recording this
in any way  shape or form 
not on paper 
not on tape  nothing 
in fact  i probably shouldn t
even be speaking to you  so   
look  mr  garabedian 
i know there s things
you cannot tell me 
but i also know
there s a story here 
and i think
it s an important story 
i already talked
to the phoenix 
yeah  and there s a reason
i didn t see it 
nobody reads
the phoenix anymore 
they re broke 
they don t have any power 
the globe does 
if we cover this story 
everybody will hear about it 
the church thinks
in centuries  mr  rezendes 
do you think your paper has the
resources to take that on 
yeah  i do 
but if you don t
mind me asking 
do you 
i can t talk to you right now 
mr  rezendes  i m very  very busy 
sharon  yeah 
thank you 
can i at least talk to some
of your clients  the victims 
i d really like
to do that 
call me tomorrow  i gotta think about it 
thank you 
thanks 
yeah  yeah 
i got more clips
from the library 
leave  em right there 
are you guys doing
a story on the church 
no  we are not doing
a story on the church 
matt  you find anything
on this guy  phil saviano 
no  who is he 
he s part of
a victims  organization 
kurkjian did a story on him
right after the porter case 
there s a victims 
organization 
yeah  it s called snap 
it s survivors network
of those abused by priests 
  crummy acronym 
  hmm 
you want me to track him down 
yeah  bring him in 
how much longer you need
to get through the clips 
i mean  a few days 
there s a lot 
lisa s still sending up more 
okay 
hey  guys  i think i got
another priest 
liam barrett 
molested some kids in philly
and was moved to boston 
did the same thing
and was moved again 
really 
that sounds like geoghan 
is that one of our clips 
yeah  byline s
diego ribadeneira  1997 
must ve been back when
he was working religion 
was there any folo 
not much  one short piece 
huh 
the church settled the case 
don t you know
jim sullivan 
yeah  why 
looks like the church
brought him in to help out 
jesus   
has anybody but manny gotten
the ball out of the infield 
nope  why do you even
bother with that thing 
it distracts me
from the game 
know what else
is good for that 
oh  yeah  good idea 
my round  i ll be right back 
anybody want any food 
no 
i m all set 
hey  a hot dog 
so you guys
making any progress 
absolutely  it s a good story 
why 
because you re another lapsed
catholic pissed off at the church 
we ve got a lot of good stuff 
like what 
i m just watching the game 
omertà 
they got another priest 
liam barrett 
we reported on him 
i m just saying  we did 
okay 
but this guy was shuffled around from
parish to parish every few years 
just like geoghan
and porter 
i think there s a pattern 
sounds thin 
what else you got 
sacha s got another guy from a
victims  organization  phil saviano 
from snap  oh  boy 
we reported on him  too 
i thought you were watching
the game  steve 
that guy s pretty
banged up  mike 
we did a couple
stories on him 
that guy would not
stop writing letters 
he wants a holy war 
what  so he s not
worth talking to 
where are you
on garabedian 
i m working on it 
robby said macleish
thinks he s bluffing 
i think there s
something there  ben 
get me something solid 
or i m taking you off it 
i don t want us chasing
our tails on this 
stay away
from that trap 
you couldn t reach that
trap in a million years  partner 
i ve reached that trap before 
yeah  now paul  maybe 
  how we doing 
  we re good 
we re two up in the front 
good 
how s that new editor
working out 
well  he doesn t
like baseball 
but he seems like
a smart guy 
yeah  i read an article
about him 
said he s the first
jewish editor at the globe 
must have been
a slow news day 
he got a family 
this guy 
no  he is not married 
divorced 
i don t think so  no 
so the new editor of the globe is an
unmarried man of the jewish faith
who hates baseball 
yeah 
should have given it to ben 
he s a bradlee 
for crying out loud 
didn t raise his hand
fast enough  i guess 
hey  by the way 
i ve been reading about this priest 
father barrett 
said you were
involved with that 
barrett  yeah  bad egg 
lake street asked
for help  i pitched in 
victims said cardinal law knew about
barrett when he came from philly 
is that true 
you know i can t talk
about the case  robby 
off the record 
off the record
i can t talk about it 
all right 
this related to the lawsuit 
you know about that 
look 
i don t know this guy baron
or what his agenda is 
frankly  i don t care 
i just don t want to see you
taking a bullet for him 
i think you re away 
put it over here 
let s go  let s go 
so the other day
i was on the world wide web 
anything you want to know 
it s right there 
now  i have to admit
that as a priest 
this makes me
a little nervous 
should i be worried
about job security 
i don t think so 
you see 
knowledge is one thing 
but faith   
faith is another 
hey 
hey 
shouldn t you be
golfing or something 
golfing s not a verb 
and i couldn t get
a tee time 
is that what they call it 
 tee time  
they also call it  a leisure activity  
you ought to try it  mike 
i do  i run 
yeah  you run to work 
so why are you here today 
going over these clips
of saviano 
yep  ben and steve
think it s a dead end 
they gave me a bunch of
crap about it at the game 
yeah  ben emailed me 
he did 
yeah 
he said we should
let it go 
what do you wanna do 
i wanna bring saviano in 
so  just ignore those guys 
i think we ve got to start
ignoring everybody on this one 
i m good with that 
mmm 
do you think marty has any idea
what s coming down the pike 
nope  i don t think
he cares either 
that s refreshing 
yeah 
unless he s wrong 
i ve always been
fascinated with the newspaper business 
i used to sit in on the lectures
with the nieman fellows
when i was at harvard 
i read that you were
an editor once 
oh  yes 
yeah  that was
a very long time ago 
the mississippi register 
small  diocesan newspaper 
but for a 30 year old pastor 
it was a big responsibility 
too much at times 
how so 
i was close with
the evers brothers 
we took a stand
on civil rights 
our readership
was not pleased 
they saw me
as a meddling outsider 
i can imagine 
tough seat to sit in 
especially in a small town 
i think you ll find that boston s
still a small town  too  marty 
in many ways 
but if i can be of any help 
marty  don t hesitate to ask 
i find that
the city flourishes
when its great institutions
work together 
thank you 
personally i m of the opinion that for
a paper to best perform its function 
it really needs
to stand alone 
ah  of course 
but my offer still stands 
thank you 
come in 
ah 
thank you  maureen 
a little gift  marty 
think of it as a cardinal s
guide to the city of boston 
i m here to see
sacha pfeiffer 
your name 
phil saviano 
okay  just a minute 
so am i the first
survivor you ve talked to 
yeah  phil 
you are 
okay  well   
first of all  let me say thank you
for having me in today 
and i want you to know
that you have the full cooperation
of my organization  snap 
how many members are in
your organization  phil 
we had 11 at
our last chapter meeting   
uh  no  10 
karen just moved 
you had a woman
in your group 
of course there was a woman 
they don t discriminate 
not when it comes to abuse 
and this has nothing
to do with being gay 
what this is  is priests using
the collar to rape kids 
kids  boys and girls 
i was 11 
and i was preyed upon by father
david holley in worcester 
and i don t mean prayed for 
i mean preyed upon 
are any of you catholic 
i was raised catholic 
now i go to my wife s presbyterian church 
i m lapsed 
i go to church with
my grandmother sometimes 
it s safe to say we were all
raised catholic  but now   
not so much 
okay  well 
let me tell you 
when you re a poor kid from a poor
family  religion counts for a lot 
and when a priest pays attention
to you  it s a big deal 
he asks you to collect
the hymnals
or take out the trash 
you feel special 
it s like god
asking for help 
so maybe it s a little weird
when he tells you a dirty joke 
but now you got a secret
together  so you go along 
then he shows you a porno mag 
and you go along 
and you go along 
and you go along 
until one day he asks you to jerk
him off or give him a blow job 
and so you go along
with that  too 
because you feel trapped 
because he has groomed you 
how do you say
no to god  right 
see 
it is important to understand that
this is not just physical abuse 
it s spiritual abuse  too 
and when a priest does this to you 
he robs you of your faith 
so you reach for
the bottle or the needle 
or if those don t work 
you jump off a bridge 
that s why we call
ourselves survivors 
have you read
jason berry s book 
he wrote about the gauthe
case in louisiana 
uh  that s  g    
g a u t h e 
here  and talk to
richard sipe 
he worked in one of the
church s treatment centers 
he s an ex priest 
married a nun 
here 
this is his testimony
from the kos case 
uh  phil 
what s a treatment center 
it s where they send priests
when they get caught 
this is all right here
in the box 
i sent this all to you guys
five years ago 
uh  to the globe 
who did you send it to 
i don t wanna say who  but they
said that they weren t interested 
uh  but phil  we did run a
couple of stories on you 
i saw them in the clips 
yeah  but to be completely frank 
it wasn t enough 
you guys gotta understand 
this is big 
this is not just boston  it s the
whole country  it s the whole world 
and it goes right
up to the vatican 
do you have any
proof of that  phil 
no  not yet  but think about it 
there are so many of them 
how else could they have
hidden it for so long 
so many what 
priests 
priests 
i know of 13
right here in boston 
you know 13 priests in boston
who have molested children 
yeah  why do you keep
repeating everything i say 
i just like to
clarify things 
maybe you should have
clarified it five years ago
when i sent you
all of this stuff 
it s all right here 
may i use your bathroom 
yeah  sure  phil 
come on 
well  what do you think 
well  the guy  he s got an agenda 
that s for sure 
you think 
he s obviously been through a lot 
but he s smart  and if he s
right about 13 priests   
yeah  it might be
a big  if  with this guy 
do a background check
on him 
and follow up with some of the
other survivors of his group 
i ll track down
this ex priest  sipe 
okay  but stay on garabedian

um  would you mind if i took some notes

i just had a kid 
he s only one  but i m not sure
i want him to know about this 
sure  i get that 
you can stop this interview
at any time  patrick 
all right 
okay 
go ahead with your notes 
okay  so  um   
where d you live
when it first happened 
in the projects 
over in hyde park 
over by the stop   shop 
yeah  you know it 
yeah  i drove a cab
for a few years 
open early 
bad coffee  right 
yeah  i guess 
how old were you
when it happened 
i was 12 
just after my dad
killed himself 
ah  jeez 
he was a real
piece of shit 
and my mom 
she wasn t so stable either 
how do you mean 
i mean  she was nuts 
she was a schizophrenic 
same shit 
when did you
first meet geoghan 
well  my sister 
she saw him over
in the dunkin  donuts 
tells him about my old man passing 
and he rushed right over 
and there was this nun 
sister barbara 
and she ran this group for
kids from troubled families 
mmm hmm 
where was that 
st  ambrose in dorchester 
okay 
she s the one who introduced
me to father shanley 
he was a street priest 
long hair  very hip 
he invited me to his
apartment in back bay 
where in back bay 
beacon street 
beacon  okay 
are you from here 
uh  no  i grew up in ohio 
but my mom s from southie 
okay  so you get it 
i d never even seen back bay 
so what happened
on that first visit  joe 
well  he was very nice
at first 
very funny  very casual 
and i think he could tell
i was gay 
so he showed me this mobile he had 
like  over a baby s crib 
mmm hmm 
but with different words 
 homosexual 
transsexual  bisexual  
okay  and did you know you
were gay at that time  joe 
yeah 
but that wasn t information
i was sharing with anybody 
not in dorchester 
okay 
so  what happened after
he showed you the mobile 
well  i was
a little freaked out 
mmm hmm 
i think he could tell 
so he said   you know what ll
help is if we play strip poker  
course i lost 
and  uh  things went on
from there 
can you tell me
specifically what happened 
specifically  he   
he molested me 
joe  i think that the language is
going to be so important here 
we can t sanitize this 
just saying  molest  isn t enough 
people need to know
what actually happened 
we should probably get these to go 
right 
geoghan shows up 
and my mom  you know  she s   
she s thrilled 
i mean   
this was like god
showing up  you know 
sure  right 
so what happened then 
you really want to
hear this shit 
yeah  yeah  patrick  i do 
he offers to take me
to get ice cream 
and  you know  he s a priest 
i m a kid  so i go 
sure 
so we re driving home and he   
he starts patting my leg 
you know  then
his hand just slides right up 
and he grabs my dick 
you know  i just froze up 
i was fucking petrified  i couldn t move 
i didn t know what to do 
i was just a little kid 
yeah 
you know  i never even
touched my ice cream 
it just melted down my arm 
did you  um   
did you see him again
after that 
yeah 
all right  that s good 
let s stop there for now 
sure 
he said it was a way to make me
more comfortable with my body 
mmm 
so what happened
after that 
well  he took off his
clothes  and he said 
 i ve been so depressed  
 but maybe you can cheer me
up and give me a blow job  
classy guy 
and did you 
yeah 
i know what you must be thinking 
like  why would i ever do that
to some creepy guy who s 30
years older than me  but   
what you have to understand is that
this is the first time in my life
that someone told me that it
was okay to be gay  mmm hmm 
and it was a priest 
right 
so you had oral sex 
did you have intercourse 
yes 
not then  but later 
it really
messed me up 
i m sober now  but that   
that was the beginning of it all 
it s very confusing 
you know 
to be introduced to sex
like that and then   
and then to be
attracted to men  it s   
i m sorry 
i knew i was gonna do this 
oh  i m sorry 
don t be sorry 
it s okay  joe 
it s okay 
of course there is a
church right there 
and a playground 
joe  did you ever
try and tell anyone 
like who  a priest 
can i use your phone 
yeah  sure 
you know where it is 
you can use my name
if you want 
thanks  patrick 
don t thank me 
just get these assholes  will you 
he s one of the lucky ones 
he s still alive 
do you want
a cup of tea  sacha 
i m okay  nana  thanks 
okay 
hello 
hi  joe  it s sacha pfeiffer 
hi  sacha  how are you 
i m good  thanks 
listen  joe  i just wanted
to follow up on one thing 
you talked to phil saviano
about all of this  right 
yeah  i did 
i went to a couple of snap meetings 
and did phil ever suggest
you do anything about it 
no 
the meetings
weren t really about that 
i mean  a couple of them
had gone to a lawyer 
but i didn t think
it was worth it 
why not 
there were just so
many forms to fill out 
it was overwhelming 
you know 
and he said it could only get
me a small settlement  so   
who  who said that 
the lawyer told me that 
so you did go
and see a lawyer 
yeah  but i didn t
end up using him 
so i didn t think
it was important 
i m sorry  i m not
trying to hide anything 
no  i know  joe 
do remember his name 
the lawyer 
no  but maybe phil
would know 
the guy was on tv a lot
during the porter case 
he was handsome 
was it eric macleish 
yeah  that s it  macleish 
i thought
he was very handsome 
hey 
hey 
i was just in the newsroom 
judge sweeney set a date for the hearing 
really  when 
two weeks  in springfield 
canellos started a pool 
ten bucks to get in 
anyone picking the globe 
he s only taking bets on how
fast sweeney rules against us 
  robby 
  hi  it s me 
did you get my message 
i did 
looks like father shanley
could be our fourth priest 
yeah  i think he is 
did you follow up
with macleish 
i just talked to phil 
he said macleish dealt with
a number of these cases 
guess he forgot to mention that 
yeah 
i m gonna go to
the courthouse tomorrow 
see if i can find any cases he
settled against the church 
all right  call me
after you do  good night 
okay  good night 
hey 
you wanted to chat 
yeah  i m late for a dinner 
you wanna walk me out 
sure 
jeez 
does this guy ever go home 
apparently not 
i got guys who won t leave
till he does 
he s wearing out the goddamn newsroom 
where are we on geoghan 
following up
on more victims 
hey  i want to expand
the investigation 
why 
we got a fourth priest 
there might be
as many as 13 
thirteen 
yeah 
who s your source 
phil saviano 
oh  jesus christ  robby  i told mike   
i know  i know   
i think saviano
might be legit  ben 
you wanna elaborate
on that 
no  not really 
it just feels like this thing s
stacking up  it s my gut 
okay 
okay  good 
thank you 
hello 
mr  rezendes 
uh  yeah  who s this 
it s richard sipe 
oh  yeah  hey  richard  how are you 
i m good 
uh  thanks
for calling  look   
phil saviano
gave me your name 
i was wondering if i can
ask you a few questions 
of course  yeah 
great 
so  phil told me
that you were working
at one of the church s treatment
centers in baltimore 
yes  the seton
psychiatric institute 
it was run by
the daughters of charity 
and  uh 
when was that  richard 
well  i started my psychotherapy
fellowship there in 1965 
and i was there
for five years 
but i spent the next 30 studying
abusive priests and their victims 
really 
mmm hmm 
and that s been
your sole focus 
look  mike 
the church wants us to believe
that it s just a few bad apples 
but it s a much
bigger problem than that 
how much bigger  richard 
well  based on the research 
i would classify it as a
recognizable psychiatric phenomenon 
that s big 
hey  mac 
hey 
if i wanted historical
data on a priest 
parishes he d been
assigned to 
where would i find that 
the geoghan case  it s all in the clips 
lisa has the source material 
yeah  what if it was
for another priest 
one that hadn t been
in the papers 
you re looking at another priest 
who re you looking at 
any ideas 
oh  come on  matt 
you re not going to tell me 
i gotta get to a meeting 
thanks  mac 
hey  steve 
the archdiocese puts
out an annual directory 
every priest and parish 
that s great 
do these go back
any further than  98 
oh  yeah  going back to
the  80s in the mez 
beyond that you gotta
go to the bpl 
in the mez  huh  thanks  lisa 
you bet 
he said they all target
the same kind of kid 
low income families 
absentee fathers  broken homes 
so a guy like geoghan goes after
boys not because he prefers them 
but because they have
more shame 
less likely to talk 
these guys
are predators  robby 
and i talked to sipe 
he said he d seen dozens of them
in the  60s in seton 
he called it
a  phenomenon  
why didn t he go public 
he did 
but the church made a huge
effort to discredit him 
smear campaigns 
public statements by prominent bishops 
it s just like saviano said 
and garabedian 
you getting anywhere
with him 
more victims 
more victims 
you can t empty his pockets 
i ll get to him 
i just need more time 
oh  come on  mike 
you gotta get him 
i ll get him  i ll get him 
jesus  what the hell
is that smell 
there s a dead rat
in the corner 
what have you got 
church directories 
it s every priest
in massachusetts 
what parish
they re assigned to 
are these official 
yeah 
i figured it could
help us track down
some of the priests
that saviano mentioned 
maybe find
some more victims 
can we turn on some more lights 
i couldn t find the switch 
you wanna borrow my glasses 
no  i m good  i m good 
look  1983  john geoghan 
st  brendan parish  dorchester 
so we can find out where any
priest is in any given year 
yeah  i got him here at   
huh 
what 
1980  the year geoghan was pulled from jp 
it says he s on sick leave 
come on 
it really says that 
where is  uh  1991 
here ya go 
let me see this 
barrett  barrett  liam 
i can t read that 
look for a liam barrett in there 
1991 s the year they pulled
him out of charlestown 
barrett  liam 
yeah 
 sick leave  
it s an official designation 
let s get these upstairs 
and  matt  check on those
priests saviano gave us 
  robby  yeah 
  hey  i m down at the courthouse 
something s not right here 
nothing on shanley either  sacha 
okay  thanks 
yeah  we need to go talk
to macleish again 
really  why 
huh  there s nothing here 
there aren t any records 
i checked every name 
thanks for waiting  so sorry  guys 
stuck on a call 
not a problem 
how are you  good 
thanks for meeting us 
you bet  what s up  guys 
mr  macleish  are you familiar
with a priest named paul shanley 
yes  i am familiar
with him 
and have you settled cases
against father shanley 
as i m sure you can understand 
i can t discuss that with you 
how about  uh 
father ronald paquin 
well  i can t discuss that with you either 
come on  guys 
we understand you ve settled several
cases against each of them 
even if i d been involved
in those cases 
the settlements
would be confidential 
and i could be disbarred for
acknowledging their existence 
okay 
mmm hmm 
look  i told you guys 
these are tough cases 
most of these folks  they
just want some acknowledgment
of what happened 
we got  em a sit down with the
bishop and a little dough 
and that s the best
they could hope for 
well  it s certainly the best
the priests could hope for 
no  the church promised they d take
the priests out of circulation 
and did you follow up
on that 
do you guys
need anything else 
yes  why aren t there
any records 
i was down at
the courthouse earlier 
there aren t any records
of any of these settlements 
we dealt directly
with the church 
we would draw up a demand letter
and send it to the chancery 
you never filed
anything in court 
it s a private mediation 
so  this is just you
and the archdiocese s lawyers
in a room 
correct 
anyone else 
occasionally  the church would bring in
another defense attorney to help out 
you have names 
nope 
no  i don t 
so this was all
under the table 
there s no paper trail 
at all 
the victim has to sign
a confidentiality agreement
to get the settlement 
the lawyer takes a third and the
church sweeps it under the rug 
jeez 
it s a freakin  racket 
it s more complicated
than that 
macleish s got a duty to the client
to get the best deal he can 
sure  but how many victims do
you represent and profit from
before you say something 
garabedian would say none 
that s why he s taking
these cases to court
because he wants people
to know about this 
i agree 
and legal ethics aside  ben 
i mean  operating
the way macleish has
all but guarantees that the
abuse stays under wraps 
yeah  did macleish confirm
all saviano s priests 
no  he s limited by his
confidentiality agreement 
but clearly he s settled cases
against a number of them 
phil s put me in touch with
some of the other victims 
i m pretty confident all of his
priests are gonna check out 
so it is 13 priests 
yeah 
looks that way 
holy shit 
okay  keep going 
i m sorry 
what was the name again 
uh  baron 
b a r o n 
i m having trouble finding it 
just give me a second 
it s okay  kim 
i can vouch for him 
i m pete conley  i m on the
board of catholic charities 
welcome to boston 
mr  baron 
thank you 
i appreciate you joining us 
we re very proud of the
work we do here at boston 
oh  the cardinal said
you had a nice visit 
yes  we did 
he s an extraordinary man 
i m glad you had a chance to chat 
enjoying yourself 
uh  to be honest  these events
aren t really my strong suit 
yeah  are you involved
with the charity 
not directly  no 
several of my friends are 
we all went to high school 
bc high 
that s the school across
the street from the globe 
it s hard to miss 
yeah 
hard to get away from 
too  apparently 
the cardinal s in the corner
if you re so inclined 
we ve met 
really 
did he mention the suit 
no  but he did give me a
copy of the catechism 
yeah  well  the cardinal s
not known for his subtlety 
during the porter investigation 
he d literally called down the
power of god on the globe 
how d that play out 
a week later our editor
broke his leg skiing 
shrimp toast 
gentlemen 
no  thanks 
no 
you said one of the victims
filed a criminal complaint 
yeah  there were
a few of them 
but the judge had
the case records sealed
after friends of
the church complained 
and the church has
a lot of friends 
like eric macleish 
yeah 
let s just say he s not
part of the solution 
you follow what i m saying 
sure 
you work hard 
mr  rezendes 
are you married 
yeah 
your wife doesn t mind you
working all the time 
oh  yeah  she does 
that s why i never got married 
i m too busy 
what i do
is too important 
hmm 
your new editor 
he s a jew right 
oh  that s right  yeah 
yeah  see 
he comes in and suddenly everybody s
interested in the church 
you know why 
because it takes
an outsider  like me 
i m armenian 
how many armenians
do you know in boston 
steve kurkjian 
works at the globe 
oh  that s two 
you should get a prize or something 
what are you  italian 
no  i m portuguese 
from where 
east boston 
really  east boston 
you don t sound like it 
this city  these people 
making the rest of us
feel like we don t belong 
but they re no better
than us 
look at how they treat
their children 
mark my words 
mr  rezendes 
if it takes a village
to raise a child 
it takes a village
to abuse one 
hey  here he is  want a beer 
love one 
another 
you here with barbara 
no  she hates these things 
karen  too 
yeah 
smart ladies 
sláinte 
mmm 
i met your new editor 
seemed like a decent fellow 
i think he is 
hey  i had an interesting conversation
with eric macleish the other day 
turns out he s been settling abuse
cases with the archdiocese for years 
you really wanna
talk about this here 
jim  you said you helped out
on father barrett as a favor 
that was a one off 
how many of these cases
have you been involved with 
you know i can t answer that  robby 
it s unethical 
is that all it is 
so  this would be
the robby robinson
i ve always heard about
but never met 
listen to me  jimmy 
you wanna be on
the right side of this 
this is the church
you re talking about  robby 
look around 
these are good people 
done a lot of good
for this city 
enjoy the party 
i ve been through
a lot of these now 
 sick leave  isn t the
only designation they use
when they take one of these
priests out of circulation 
they use a slew of terms 
 absent on leave  
 unassigned  
 emergency response  
they got a word for everything  these guys 
hmm  except  rape  
and they move parishes way more
frequently than other priests 
when i was a kid 
a priest moved
after seven or eight years 
sometimes longer 
these guys  it s two
to three years tops 
and did they use these designations
for all of saviano s priests 
yeah  it s a pretty
clear pattern 
guys  i got sipe 
i think if you really
want to understand the crisis 
you need to start with
the celibacy requirement 
that was my first
major finding 
only 50  of the clergy
are celibate 
now  most of them are having
sex with other adults 
but the fact remains that this
creates a culture of secrecy
that tolerates and
even protects pedophiles 
so you believe the church is aware
of the extent of this crisis 
oh  absolutely  after the first
major scandal in louisiana 
tom doyle  the secretary canonist
for the papal nuncio 
co authored a report
warning pedophile priests
were a
billion dollar liability 
that was in 1985 
1985 
that s right 
who saw that report 
anyone from the catholic hierarchy 
sure 
doyle tried to introduce
the report at
the national conference
of catholic bishops 
in fact  cardinal law initially
helped to fund the report 
but then he backed out 
and they shelved it 
are you kidding me 
richard  robby here 
we think we have 13 priests in
boston that fit this pattern 
which would be
a very  very big story 
does that sound right to you
in terms of scale 
no  not really  robby 
it sounds low to me 
my estimates suggest 6  act
out sexually with minors 
uh  6  of what 
6  of all priests 
how many priests
do we have in boston 
about 1 500 
1  is 15 
6  is
90 
all right  90 priests 
is that possible 
from a metric standpoint 
yes  that would certainly be
in line with my findings 
hello 
uh   
ninety fucking priests 
in boston 
that s what he said 
if there were 90 of these bastards 
people would know 
maybe they do 
and no one said a thing 
good germans 
i don t think that s a comparison
you want to make publically 
macleish knew 
he just didn t say anything 
that s 13 priests 
there s a big difference
between 13 and 90 
where s this guy sipe
getting his numbers 
well  he s been studying
it for 30 years 
he is a trained
psychotherapist 
okay  but we need something
more than a metric
from some hippy ex priest
who s shacking up with a nun 
okay  so we ll track down more victims 
we ll get more priests 
then we can check them
against the directories 
that s a shitload
of victims 
we ll get there 
how long s it gonna take 
too long 
wait  but   
meeting s over 
yeah  for now 
look  what ve you got 
what if we work backwards 
what do you mean  from what 
from the directories 
we ve been using them
to confirm bad priests 
what if we do it
the other way around 
use the directories to identify
bad priests  yeah  exactly 
we search by designation 
we look for any priest on
 sick leave  or  unassigned  
or have been moved around a lot 
yeah 
it s gonna take
a load of work 
well  not if we re
all on it 
you  too 
generally that s what  all  means  yeah 
yeah  generally 
library is closing 
library is closing 
holy shit 
no freakin  way 
  talbot 
  yeah 
  tivnan 
  yeah 
toma 
yeah 
turnbull 
yeah 
walsh 
yeah 
welsh 
yeah 
that s it 
that s it 
holy shit 
robby 
that s three off sipe s estimate 
that s incredible 
robby 
how many 
eighty seven 
eighty seven priests
in boston 
call macleish  i wanna talk to him 
okay 
can you print it 
sure can 
jim sullivan s office 
yeah  walter robinson
for jim sullivan 
tell him it s important 
please 
one moment  please 
hey  robby 
everything okay 
i need you
to tell me something  jim 
could it be 90 priests 
what 
could it be as high as 90 
jesus  robby 
i need to know  jim  i wouldn t
be asking if it wasn t important 
you gotta stop this  robby 
robby  macleish s assistant said
he s all booked up  he can t see us 
yeah  well  the hell
he can t 
all right 
that ll be fun 
you know what 
i ll catch up with you  okay 
we re good 
hey  guys 
i m really sorry  i am 
but i don t have any time
to talk right now 
but if you call
my assistant   
mr  macleish 
we have reason to believe
that there are allegations against
as many as 87 priests in boston 
i can t talk to you
about that 
does that number sound right to you 
you gotta be kidding me 
i just told you i don t have
time for this crap right now 
eric  how many priests
did you settle 
robby  you know
i can t tell you that 
you re gonna give me the names
and the names of their victims 
are you threatening me 
we ve got two stories here 
we ve got a story
about degenerate clergy 
and we ve got a story
about a bunch of lawyers
turning child abuse
into a cottage industry 
now  which story
do you want us to write 
 cause we re writing
one of them 
i already sent you
a list of names 
what re you talking about 
to whom 
the globe  years ago 
after the porter case 
i got plenty of calls 
i had 20 priests
in boston alone 
but i couldn t go after them
without the press 
so i sent you guys a list of names 
and you buried it 
i want those names tomorrow 
check your
goddamn clips  robby 
we didn t find
anything in the clips 
yeah  big surprise 
richard  do you still
go to mass 
no  no  i haven t been
to church for some time now 
but i still
consider myself a catholic 
how does that work 
well  the church
is an institution  mike 
made of men 
it s passing 
my faith is in the eternal 
i try to separate the two 
sounds tricky 
it is 
especially since the church
continues to go after me 
it takes a toll  mike 
they ll try to silence
anyone who speaks out 
i m sure they ll come after you
and your team soon enough 
really  and how do you think
they ll do that 
hello 
richard 
who is it 
it s the archbishop
of canterbury 
i had dinner at santarpio s 
had some leftovers 
ah  you re the freakin  best 
thanks  you want a beer 
yeah 
you got it 
jesus 
how much longer you gonna be
in this shithole 
yeah  i m working on it 
she s a good girl  mike 
yeah  she is 
we ll figure it out 
i haven t had
a lot of time lately 
i just got off the phone
with sipe  actually 
have you met this guy
in person yet 
no  but his knowledge of this
is on a whole other level 
i m freaking starving 
so  where are we
with the 90 
we re close 
how close 
we re close 
just answer the question  will you 
we got 87 names 
we re trying to get confirmation 
i think we will 
something bugging you 
it s just surprising 
that s all 
yeah  yeah  it is 
for everybody 
oh  hey  ben 
i forgot to ask you 
phil saviano said he sent a bunch of
info over to the globe years ago 
do you have any idea to who 
no  why 
well  i m just curious 
i wanted to see
if there s any leads
you guys didn t run out 
saviano was a fucking train
wreck five years ago  mike 
we didn t miss anything 
this story needed spotlight 
yeah  i agree 
i m just following up 
good night 
yeah  good night 
this is unbelievable 
when did you get this 
macleish emailed
the list this morning 
he settled cases
against 45 priests 
where are we on law 
anything that shows he
had knowledge of this 
we re still working garabedian 
but nothing concrete 
i keep thinking about that
conversation we had the other night
about how law called
down the power of god
when we reported on porter 
that s just law
being law 
okay  but i checked the clips 
and  uh  porter isn t even
in the boston archdiocese 
  he s from fall river 
  so
why the extreme reaction 
law had to know 
that s why he
had the reaction 
because he knew
there were others 
i think that s
the bigger story 
bigger than 50 priests 
if it came from
the top down  yes 
but the numbers
clearly indicate
that there were senior
clergy involved 
that s all they do 
indicate 
are you telling me
that if we run a story
with 50 pedophile
priests in boston   
mike 
we ll get into the same cat
fight you got into on porter 
which made a lot of noise 
but changed things
not one bit 
we need to focus on the institution 
not the individual priests 
practice and policy 
show me the church
manipulated the system
so that these guys wouldn t
have to face charges 
show me they put
those same priests
back into parishes 
time and time again 
show me this was systemic 
that it came
from the top down 
sounds like we re
going after law 
we re going
after the system 
make a list of all the victims we have 
start reaching out 
and bring matt in if you need help 
mmm hmm 
okay  hey  when you
go to springfield 
  our hearing is monday 
  okay 
hey  robby 
you got a second 
yeah 
i  uh  got one of those
treatment centers
a block from
my house 
we got neighbors
with kids 
i know that the work we do is
confidential  but i m feeling like   
i should tell  em 
we ll tell  em soon

uh  sacha pfeiffer 
boston globe 
oh  yeah  hi 
hi  thank you 
anything else
you can recall 
no 
no  but i got
a cousin in quincy 
she saw him in the street
a few years later 
the bishop came
over to the house 
he said nothing like this
had ever happened before 
and he asked us
not to press charges 
and what did
your mother do 
my mother 
she put out
freakin  cookies 
there was a lot of
pressure to keep quiet 
from the church 
yeah  from
the church 
but not just
the church 
from my friends 
from the other
parishioners 
well  many of
the priests that i treated
were psychosexually stunted 
on the emotional level
of a 12  or 13 year old 
jeez 
sure the chief knew 
everybody knew 
but nobody wants
to cuff a priest 
mmm 
and what about
the prosecutor 
i shouldn t talk
about this shit 
i think you should 
actually 
do you know a father hurley
or a father gale 
i do 
i swear to god 
i ll beat the shit out of you 
sorry to bother you 
you leave me alone 
you leave my brother alone 
you hear me 
god damn it 
hi there 
i m looking for ronald paquin 
yes 
you re father paquin 
yes  that s right 
i m sacha pfeiffer
from the boston globe 
okay 
could i ask you
a few questions 
go ahead  dear 
we spoke to several men who
you knew when they were boys
at st  john the baptist
in haverhill 
they told us you molested them 
is that true 
sure i fooled around 
but i never felt gratified myself 
right  um  but you
admit to molesting boys
at st  john the baptist 
yes  yes 
but as i said 
i never got
any pleasure from it 
that s important
to understand 
right 
um  but can you
tell me where and how
you fooled around
with these boys 
i want to be clear 
i never raped anyone 
there s a difference 
i should know 
how would you know 
i was raped 
i m sorry 
who raped you 
ronnie  who re
you talking to 
it s okay  jane 
father paquin  who raped you 
who are you 
uh    sacha pfeiffer 
from the globe

mr

sorry 
uh  i m sorry  who are you 
i m his sister 
and i don t want
you coming back here 
ms  paquin   
beat you to
the end of the street 
no  you won t 
i beat you last time 
no  you didn t 
you cheated 
you did 
could you please clarify the globe s
position for me  mr  albano 
yes  judge sweeney 
our argument to make
these documents public
rests mainly on
first amendment grounds 
we also have a number
of other relevant arguments 
after all  your honor 
this was a
discretionary order 
yes  it was made
at the judge s discretion 
hey  mike 
hey  joe 
what s a
spotlight reporter
doing in springfield 
your boy albano s
sledding uphill 
you actually think you have a
shot at winning this thing 
you want me to comment
for the herald 
 globe reporter
would not comment 
 but he did not
seem hopeful  
he didn t try
and hide it at all 
he had this really odd
rationalization for it 
like it was
totally normal
to fool around
with little boys 
i d really like to go back 
i think he d talk to us 
oh  we will 
just not yet 
i want you to stay focused
on the victims right now 
sacha  where d they send
father talbot again 
um  i think   
wasn t that cheverus 
cheverus  that s right 
wait  father talbot
from bc high 
yeah  you know him 
yeah  he was there
when i was 
we have a victim 
yeah  lives
in providence 
there s nothing personal in
these documents  your honor 
they concern how the
cardinal is handling   
say  the archdiocese  
excuse me 
you don t get to
tag the cardinal
with everything 
mr  albano 
say  the archdiocese  
judge sweeney  the globe
is not a party to this case 
they just want
to sell papers 
if mr  garabedian
had not smeared
the cardinal s
good name 
we wouldn t even be here 
your honor  i object to the
use of the word  smear  
duly noted 
mr  garabedian 
thank you  your honor 
anything else 
mr  rogers 
no  your honor 
mr  albano 
you may continue 
the globe
believes having   
hey  mitch 
how are you doing 
i m fine 
he s tough 
that wilson rogers 
he s smug 
and he s sloppy 
he doesn t seem sloppy 
you don t know the half of it 
trust me 
what s the
half of it 
tell me the
half of it  mitch 
off the record 
off the record  yeah 
three years ago 
i get a call from an ex priest 
anthony benzevich 
he was at blessed
sacrament back in  62 
and he saw geoghan
taking little boys up to
the rectory bedroom  okay 
so he s appalled 
all right 
tells the bishop
about it 
the bishop threatens
to reassign him
to south america 
jesus 
yeah  all right 
so fast forward 35 years 
benzevich reads that
geoghan s been charged
with molesting
hundreds of kids 
all right  so he feels guilty 
he calls me 
so you have
testimony of a priest
telling his superiors
about geoghan in  62 
no  i do not 
because when i called benzevich
in to give a deposition 
he comes in
with a lawyer 
wilson rogers 
right 
and suddenly
father benzevich
has a very foggy memory 
can t remember anything 
he s useless 
so i go back to work 
i forget about it 
whatever 
until about a year ago 
i find an article
about a priest who warned
church officials about geoghan 
benzevich went to the press 
yeah 
yeah  local paper  patriot ledger 
nobody saw it 
but now i got
benzevich on record 
so i file a motion to depose
benzevich a second time 
all right 
and wilson rogers 
that smug son of a bitch 
he files a motion
opposing my motion 
and that s when
i have him 
have him how 
rogers opposes my motion 
so i have to
make an argument
as to why i m
allowed to depose 
father benzevich
a second time  okay 
but this time 
i m allowed to attach exhibits 
do you follow
what i m saying 
the sealed documents 
yes 
i can attach
the sealed documents
that i ve gotten in discovery 
mr  rezendes 
the same documents that your
paper is currently suing for 
you re shitting me 
what 
no  no  i m not shitting you 
so i pull out the 14
most damning docs
and i attach  em
to my motion 
and they prove
everything  everything 
about the church 
about the bishops  about law 
and it s all public 
because your motion
to oppose roger s motion
is public 
yeah  exactly 
now you re
paying attention 
so i could just walk into
that courthouse right now
and get those documents 
no  you cannot 
because the documents
are not there 
but you just
said they re public 
i know i did 
but this is boston 
and the church does not
want them to be found 
so they are not there 
mitch  are you telling me
that the catholic church
removed legal documents
from that courthouse 
look  i m not crazy 
i m not paranoid 
i m experienced 
check the docket 
you ll see 
they control everything 
everything 
i gotta go back in 
these guys got
the fucking documents 
docket entry number 49 
it s in the geoghan case 
we re closing
in 10 minutes 
ten minutes 
all right 
  robby 
  hey  it s me 
hey 
you re not gonna believe it 
garabedian gave me a tip 
some of the sealed docs are already public 
they re part of
a motion he filed 
he said they re
the best of the bunch 
we don t have to wait
for sweeney s ruling 
so we can get them 
yeah  but they re not there 
already talked to albano 
he said all we have
to do is file a motion 
and sweeney will order mitch
to refile the docs 
and you think
these documents are   
he said these 14 docs were all we need 
they re huge 
okay  i ll call ben 
good work 
whether
this was truly an accident
or someone committed
an intentional act 
but either way 
extensive damage
has been done
to this building 
what happened 
they re saying
it s a prop plane 
but that s not
a prop plane 
tell linda to get every
reporter we have in here now 
you pray for the victims 
you pray for the injured 
and you pray for
those who survived 
you pray  too  for the nation 
that our response to this might reflect
the best ideals of our nation 
and even more 
reflect god s own teaching 
not only as it s shown
in christianity and judaism 
but in islam as well 
not bad  who s there 
paulson 
i wanna talk to him
when he s back 
did rezendes find a way
to get to florida yet 
they just opened the
airport in providence 
he s on his way
there now

boston globe 
boston globe 
one moment  please

i will transfer you down to metro 
mitchell garabedian 
mitch  it s mike 
i ve been trying to reach you 
i don t have time to talk to you 
mr  rezendes 
hey  just quickly

no  i just
got the order  it takes time 
okay  great  can you hold
off on refiling them 
hold off 
i have to go to florida 
once you refile
they re public 
other newspapers will be
able to get a hold of  em 
other newspapers are not my concern 
i received a judicial order 
i told you the church
is watching me 
oh  hey  mitch  please 
all i need s a few more weeks 
i can t make any promises 
goodbye 
mitch  mitch  shit 
shit 
look  i get it 
no one wants to read
about kids getting
raped by priests 
especially now 
but you asked a lot
of people to relive
some very
painful experiences 
and you just disappear 
phil  you know why we were
taken off of the story 
it s been six weeks
since 9 11 
i realize that and we re
gonna get back to it 
when 
you re doing the same thing
you guys did last time 
no 
you re dropping us 
no  maybe i should tell
the herald that story 
okay  phil 
you go ahead and do that 
it will undo all the work we ve done 
but i can t stop you 
listen to me 
i am here because i care 
we re not going away 
we re gonna tell this story 
we re gonna tell it right 
we just need a little more time 
that s all we re asking for

you re gonna do
what you want anyway 
you always do 
phil 
phil 
hey 
how s south beach 
boynton beach 
remarkably different place 
what s up 
mitch garabedian
called me today 
why d he call you 
 cause he knew you d yell at him 
he refiled the docs 
what 
robby  those docs
are public now 
we gotta get there
before anyone else does 
i know  i know  i know 
just wrap up
whatever you re doing
and get
the first flight out 
i ll book a flight now and go
straight to the courthouse tomorrow 
all right  call me when you get in 
okay 
robby  i d like to let phil saviano
know that we re back on it 
good idea 
go have dinner with hansi 
might be the last time
for a while 
mmm hmm 
robby  after
we saw macleish 
i started going
back through the clips 
and i had a little time
last week finally 
so  um  i found that 
it s from  93 
that it 
yeah  yeah  that s it 
good night 
okay  good night 
so  i was probably a few
years after you  right 
no  you were
more than a few 
believe me 
well  after bc high 
i came down to providence
and played hockey
for the friars 
oh  well  you must
have been pretty good 
no  rode the bench in college 
yeah  oh 
but i loved the city 
oh 
and we just had our third kid 
and i still get my globe 
for the record 
oh  that s good to know 
good to know 
look  kevin  uh 
that s actually why i m here 
i need to ask you some
questions about father talbot 
how d you find out 
well   
i guess
it doesn t matter 
and i never even
told my wife 
excuse me 
hey  hey  hey  hey  hey  hey 
i need to get in there 
we re closed  come on  let me in 
five minutes 
i m sorry  we re closed 
come on  five minutes 
hello 
here 
this is the geoghan case 
that s right 
those records are sealed 
no 
that s a public motion 
those records are public 
look  i work for the globe 
good for you 
can i talk to
your supervisor 
he s not in today 
what about a judge 
there must be judges that
work on this kind of thing 
sixth floor 
we understand the nature of the
allegations against father talbot 
i m just not sure what you
want from president kemeza 
talbot taught here long
before bill took over 
mmm  of course 
we just want to know
if it s possible
that the president 
the faculty  the board 
that no one knew what was
going on at the time 
i graduated in 1979  and i had
no idea about any of this 
so if you re suggesting that
father gibbons and father callahan
had in any way   
gibbons and callahan   
i mean  they ran this
place like the navy 
do you really think
they didn t know 
it s a big school  robby 
you know that 
and we re talking about
seven alleged victims
over  what  eight years 
we re talking about
seven that we know about 
this is ridiculous 
you re reaching for a story here 
we cannot possibly   
jack  jack  jack 
if i had been president then 
i would ve known 
bill  i m not sure
that s relevant 
why do you think they sent
talbot up to cheverus 
you know they
wanted him out of town 
robby  as well
intentioned as bill s remarks are 
i m hoping we can
keep this between us
until we all get
on the same page 
is that why we re here 
to get on the same page 
no  we re here because you re
an important alumnus  robby 
and a friend 
exactly  and we know you care about
this school as much as we do 
did you play
a sport here  jack 
yeah  football  why 
mmm  i ran track 
you know  i went to
providence yesterday
to talk to one of
father talbot s victims 
he played hockey here 
and  uh  he s one
of the better ones 
he s got a wife 
kids  good job 
about 10 minutes
into the conversation 
the guy breaks down 
you know 
couldn t stop crying 
said he could never figure out
why father talbot picked him 
father talbot
coached the hockey team 
so 
i guess we just got lucky 
you and me 
does jack dunn
work for the school 
no  he s pr
for boston college 
they call him
when they need help 
and pete conley 
why was he there 
good question 
pete s a big alum 
but i called bill directly 
and i asked
for a sit down 
i never mentioned
anybody else 
it s like everybody
already knows the story 
yeah 
except us 
and we work right there 
judge volterra 
yes 
hi  i m mike rezendes
from the boston globe 
um  i m having
some trouble
accessing some
public records
down in the
records room 
i was wondering if i could
have a word with you 
all right 
thank you 
thank you very much 
these exhibits you re after 
mr  rezendes 
they re very
sensitive records 
with all due respect 
your honor 
that s not the question 
the records are public 
maybe so  but tell me 
where s the editorial
responsibility
in publishing
records of this nature 
well  where s the editorial
responsibility in not publishing them 
you can t take those 
you need to make copies 
i m going to the copy room 
it closed at 4 00 
look  i ll give you
83 bucks to use yours 
hey  cabbie 
hey  hey  hey 
take me to the boston globe
on morrissey boulevard 
don t take 93 
take dorchester avenue 
robby  it s incredible 
law knew about geoghan for years 
no question 
there s a letter to law
from a woman margaret gallant 
who lived in jamaica plain in the
early  80s when geoghan was there 
listen to this 
 our family is
rooted in the church  
 our desire is to
protect the holy orders  
 even in the midst
of our agony 
 over the seven boys
in our family 
 who have been violated  
seven  robby  seven boys 
 it was suggested
we keep silent  
 we did not question the authority
of the church two years ago  
 but since father geoghan
is still in his parish    
but she sent it to law 
and law did shit 
here s another one to law  same year 
listen to this 
 a word on the recent
assignment of father geoghan 
 as an associate
at st  julia s in weston  
 father geoghan has a history of
homosexual involvement with young boys  
 i understand his recent
departure from st  brendan s 
 may be related
to this problem  
 i wonder if father geoghan should
not be reduced to just weekend work 
 while receiving
some kind of therapy  
 you know how grateful i am to
you for your constant concern  
 sincerely yours in our lord   
 most reverend john m  darcy 
auxiliary bishop of boston  
 december 7  1984  
an auxiliary bishop
wrote that 
that s incredible 
he broke ranks 
i mean 
when did gallant write her letter 
1984 
and law just ignored it 
how do you ignore
that freakin  letter 
we got  em 
you can t read these letters and
think anything else  it s proof 
yeah  it is 
this is good work 
should we
take it up to ben 
uh   
no  not yet 
why not 
we got law  this is it 
no  this is law
covering for one priest 
there s another
90 out there 
yeah  and we ll print
that story when we get it 
but we gotta go with this now 
no  i m not going to
rush this story  mike 
we don t have
a choice  robby 
if we don t rush to print 
somebody else is gonna find these
letters and butcher the story 
joe quimby from the herald
was at the
freakin  courthouse 
so we ll write
a holding story 
and we ll keep our
eye on the herald 
keep our eye on the herald 
they run this and they get it wrong 
the church will bury it 
we gotta do this now 
mike  mike   
what  why are we hesitating 
baron told us to get law 
this is law 
baron told us to
get the system 
we need the full scope 
that s the only thing
that will put an end to this 
then let s take it up
to ben  let him decide 
we ll take it to ben
when i say it s time 
it s time  robby  it s time 
they knew and they
let it happen  to kids 
okay  it could ve been you 
it could ve been me 
it could have been any of us 
we gotta nail these scumbags 
we gotta show people that
nobody can get away with this 
not a priest or a cardinal
or a freaking pope 
you finished 
yeah  i am  this is bullshit 
oh   
you okay 
mmm   
hey  hansi 
hard day at work  mike 
here 
thank you 
i don t know why
i got so pissed off 
you know  i think
robby s wrong 
you know  you re just   
you care about the story  mike 
we all do 
  yeah  i guess 
  mmm 
i stopped going to
church with my nana 
it was   
it was too hard 
you know 
i d be sitting there 
and i d start thinking
about joe crowley
or someone else and i just   
i just got so angry 
did you tell her why 
she goes to church
three times a week  mike 
it really pisses me off 
you know 
i actually really liked going to
church when i was a little kid 
mmm 
why d you stop 
typical shit 
but the weird thing is 
i think i   
i think i figured that maybe one day   
i would actually go back 
i was really   
i was holding on to that 
mmm 
i read those letters  and   
and something just cracked 
it s a shitty feeling 
yeah 
it s a shitty feeling 
looks like a long day 
hey  pete 
i m sorry to make it longer 
brian 
has anyone ever said no
to a drink with you  pete 
well  sure 
but the trick is to keep asking 
for boston 
boston 
mmm 
so  you here
for the cardinal 
oh  no  no  no  no 
i wouldn t   
i wouldn t presume to speak
for the cardinal  no 
you know 
you got a lot of people here
who respect you  robby 
the work you do 
that s good to know 
you know  it s because you
care about this place 
it s why you do what you do 
it s who you are 
you know 
but people need the church 
more than ever right now 
you know  you can feel it 
and the cardinal   
you know  the cardinal 
he might not be perfect 
but we can t
throw out all the good
he s doing over
a few bad apples 
now  you know 
i m bringing this up to you
because i know this is
baron s idea  his agenda 
i gotta tell ya 
i mean  honest to god 
i mean  he doesn t care about
this city the way we do 
i mean  how could he 
this is how it happens  isn t it  pete 
what s that 
a guy leans on a guy 
and suddenly
the whole town
just looks
the other way 
robby  robby  look it 
marty baron is just
trying to make his mark 
he s gonna be here for a couple
of years  and he s gonna move on 
just like he did in
new york and miami 
where re you gonna go 
hmm 
good night  robby 
brian 
hey  pete 
yeah 
uh   
when we do run the story  uh  i m gonna
need a comment from the cardinal 
we ll talk again later 
good night  robby 
good night  pete 
robby 
what 
no shit  when 
okay  yeah 
hey 
what s up 
sweeney ruled
in our favor 
she ruled to unseal
the documents 
jeez 
the church has already
filed an appeal 
but the trial court ruling is
generally upheld in these matters 
and when would we
get the documents 
probably takes cohen
a few weeks to rule 
then there s
a redaction process 
uh  i d say they d be
made public mid january 
okay 
all right 
thanks  jon 
you bet 
nice work 
thanks 
metro should run
something  marty 
we can t run
this one big 
why wouldn t we 
it s a major first amendment victory 
not to mention 
you get
an irish catholic judge
ruling against the church 
  that s a hell of a precedent 
  mmm hmm 
we don t want the herald
going deep on this 
why s that 
you re gonna have
to step out  peter 
i m not stepping out 
peter 
when did you  uh   
a couple of weeks ago 
a couple of weeks 
  yeah 
  and you re telling us now 
these are substantial 
they clearly show
that law was negligent 
i need more time 
i wanna keep digging 
for what 
this is the goddamn story 
it s not
the whole story 
tough shit 
we re on a clock now 
even if we don t
run sweeney s ruling 
another paper could find these
letters and fuck the story 
agreed 
but we run
these letters alone 
law apologizes 
says it s a one time thing 
he can bury it 
how  these clearly show he
knew and did nothing about it 
look  i m close to
stories on 70 priests 
we nail that 
along with those letters 
this is proof
this is bigger than law 
it s the whole system 
you have multiple sources
confirming all those priests 
on some  i can get more 
too risky  if we re not buttoned
up on every single one of them 
the church will pick us apart 
i think i can get us someone
from the other
side of the aisle 
somebody inside the church 
yeah  a lawyer 
will he go on the record 
deep background 
but he s a solid source 
rezendes needs time
to write the story 
we don t wanna drop it at
christmas  not after 9 11 
we could run it
just after new year s 
before they release
the rest of the documents 
all right 
tell canellos to bury
the ruling in metro 
you got six weeks 
thank you 
tell mike i want
a draft by christmas 
and we need a response
from lake street 
who does pr for the cardinal 
still john walsh 
no  somebody new 
donna morrisey 
she came from tv 
she s young 
good  get a quote 
we need something from law
to appear even handed 
robby  next time give
me a goddamn heads up 
will do 
silent night  holy night 
all is calm 
all is bright 
round yon virgin 
mother and child 
holy infant 
so tender and mild 
sleep in heavenly peace 
sleep in heavenly peace 
silent night  holy night 
shepherds quake 
at the sight 
glory streams
from heaven above 
heavenly hosts
sing hallelujah 
oh  robby 
what a nice surprise 
come on in 
hey  hon  look who
i found outside 
karen  can you
give us a minute 
sure 
good to see you  karen 
what s up 
i m out of time  jim 
we ve got cover up
stories on 70 priests 
but the boss
isn t gonna run it
unless i get confirmation
from your side 
are you out of your mind 
come on 
this is our town  jimmy 
everybody knew something was going on 
and no one did a thing 
we gotta put an end to it 
don t tell me
what i gotta do 
yeah  i helped defend these scumbags 
but that s my job  robby 
i was doing my job 
yeah 
you and everyone else 
get out of my house 
hey 
you come to my home
and lay this shit on me 
you were right  robby 
we all knew somethin 
was going on 
so where were you 
what took you so long 
i don t know  jim 
give me the list 
larry  we re going
to press in six hours 
donna morrisey
said she d called us
with a quote
from law hours ago 
that s what i thought 
when did you talk to her 
okay  okay  larry 
yeah  yeah  that s
good to know 
thanks  pete 
anything 
conley said donna morrisey should have
called  he just left lake street 
yeah  rasky said
the same thing 
this is ridiculous  you d think
they d wanna get ahead of this 
i mean  they d be
idiots not to 
i would love to see their faces
when they read this thing then 
you know  sunday s the
feast of the epiphany 
it seems appropriate 
mike rezendes 
hey  donna 
thanks for calling 
yeah  i just had a few questions
if you have a minute 
what 
what 
another adjective 
anything 
law just turned us down 
jesus christ 
i just got off the phone
with donna morrisey 
she said  quote 
we don t even want to know
what the questions are 
end quote 
she really said that 
yeah 
well  that oughta do it 
 the church
had no interest 
 in knowing what the globe s
questions would be  
work it in somewhere before the jump 
anything else 
uh  matt wants to put
the letters online 
so the readers can
see for themselves 
we can run the url at the
bottom of the article 
it s pretty straightforward 
okay 
we also put the spotlight tip
line at the end of the story
so people can call in 
goes directly to our office 
matt and i can go in in the
morning in case we get any calls 
yeah  i m more concerned about
the phones at reception 
after we ran
the porter case 
the message centers
were tied up for weeks 
it s a real problem 
there were picketers  too 
lots of  em 
i ll talk to richard about
the security and the phones 
uh  how are we coming
on the folo story 
well  we ve nailed
down multiple stories
on 70 priests 
  all 70 
  mmm hmm 
and with the confirmation from
robby s source  we re ready to go 
we can have
a draft next week 
uh  robby  that
source of yours 
is it something
we could revisit 
he might be tough 
but he has no problem
helping the church
protect dozens
of dirty priests 
guy s a scumbag 
he s a lawyer  he s doing his job 
he s a shill
for the church 
he knew
and did nothing 
he could ve said something years ago 
maybe saved some lives 
what about us 
what s that
supposed to mean 
we had all the pieces 
why didn t we get it sooner 
we didn t have
all the pieces 
we had saviano 
we had barrett  we had geoghan 
we had the directories
in the basement 
you know what 
we got it now 
robby  the story
needed spotlight 
mike  spotlight s
been around since 1970 
so what  we couldn t see the scope of this 
no one could 
robby  this started
with one goddamn priest 
macleish sent us a letter
on 20 priests  years ago 
sacha found the clip 
you freaking kidding me 
20 priests 
when 
uh  just after porter 
december  93 
we buried the story
in metro  no folo 
that was you 
you were metro 
yeah  that was me 
i d just taken over 
i don t remember it at all 
but yeah   
um   
can i say something here 
sometimes it s
easy to forget
that we spend most of our time
stumbling around in the dark 
suddenly a light
gets turned on 
and there s a fair share
of blame to go around 
i can t speak to what
happened before i arrived 
but  um  all of you have done
some very good reporting here 
reporting that i believe
is gonna have an immediate
and considerable
impact on our readers 
for me  this kind of story
is why we do this 
having said that  cardinal law
and the catholic community
are gonna have a very
strong response to this 
so if you need a moment 
you ve earned it 
but i will need you
back here monday morning
focused and ready
to do your job 
leaving 
yeah 
i  uh  just got a call
from the cardinal 
really  why 
he wanted to
tell me personally
that he decided
not to comment 
yeah  said he wanted to
extend me that courtesy 
jesus  the balls on that guy 
what did you say 
i told him he was
making a mistake 
and that we were
gonna run the story 
damn right we re
gonna run it 
sacha  can i have
a drink of water 
yeah  sure  nana  yeah
