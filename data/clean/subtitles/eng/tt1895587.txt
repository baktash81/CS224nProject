and the uncles pissed off
shes not married
divorced with four kids
i guess father
was helping out
helping out
hey mr burke
theyre in back talking to the bishop
and father
we put him in the break room
any press
some guy from the citizen
but we sent him away
none of the big papers
lets keep it that way
whos that
assistant da
its gonna be hard to keep the
papers away from the arraignment
what arraignment
you can tell father geoghan
it wont be much longer
now sheila you know what good
work the church does in the community
but i give you
my personal guarantee
that im going to take
father out of the parish
and this will never
happen again
well just be
another moment paul
of course father
now sheila im going
to give you my personal card
losing a good reporter
is always tough
but losing
one of our best
well to put it
as eloquently as i can
its a real kick in the ass
but robby here
has known stewart
longer than most of you
have been alive
so ill hand it off
to him robby
oh well thanks ben
i think
although i take issue with your
reference to my seniority
i will say that stewarts departure
is especially painful for me
because uh
for what stewart
twenty years now
stewarts been more
than willing to part
with his money
at the poker table
and ive got a kid
in college
yeah but im gonna keep playing
oh problem solved
godspeed then
now stewart i find the
timing of your departure
disconcerting
the corner office sits empty
the new editor
arrives on monday
so im sorry buddy
but i gotta ask ya
what the hell
do you know
hows the cake
its really good
are you saving yours
nah its for mike
i can never eat at those things
they kind of depress me
i know
did you see the numbers
from washington
yeah very interesting
i think so too
im not asking if the pds lying
i know theyre lying
all im asking
whos behind it
oh okay i get it
you dont want to talk
no dan im not mad
im hungry
ive been talking here
so long i didnt eat lunch
so im gonna go
get something to eat
and thatll give you
an hour to decide
whether you want to be
on the right side of this
or read about it
like everybody else
bye dan
you think
cahill has something
maybe i just dont think
the storys for us
ben likes it yeah its not bad
its just not spotlight
whats just not spotlight
the pd numbers
the numbers story it feels thin
oh you got cahill to talk
no but i will
good then well know
if its thin
howd it go upstairs
oh okay
robby gave a good speech
sure he did
i heard lubin and connor
are going to the times
come on really
yeah i heard that
theyre leeching us
well at least theyre sending us
a guy from miami to run things
that should help
has baron even
spent time in boston
i dont think hes ever been here before
maybe we should buy him a map
i have a friend down in miami
said he cut 15 of the staff
great
hey robby
new boss coming in
to make some cuts
i have no idea
arent you sitting down
with him
yes i am
so is it about spotlight
i dont know mike
but i do know
that ben needs an answer
on the crime numbers story
im telling you
i really dont think that storys for us
mr baron
walter robinson robby
thanks for taking the time
out of your weekend
oh my pleasure
appreciate it
what are you reading
uh
the curse of the bambino
oh yeah
its a great book
the globe has
season tickets at fenway
once youre settled in
by the way
thank you
uh to be honest
im not much of a baseball fan
im just trying to
get a feel for the city
oh yeah
so youre originally
from boston
i am born and raised yeah
a lot of the newsroom
is from here
it really feels like
a local paper in that way
and did that change at all after
the paper was sold to the times
no no i dont think
that had a big impact
good
and youre an editor
for the spotlight team
id prefer to think of myself
as player coach but yes
are you familiar
with spotlight
no not particularly
well we are a fourperson
investigative team
we report to
ben bradlee jr
and we keep
our work confidential
whatre you
working on now
we just put out a piece on a
shoddy construction outfit
and right now were really just
trolling around for our next story
how long does
that typically take
hard to say
a couple months
couple months
yeah we dont like to
rush it
once we settle on a project we can
spend a year or more investigating it
is that a concern
not necessarily
um but from what i understand
readership is down
internet is cutting into
the classified business and
i think im gonna need to
take a hard look at things
so do you anticipate
more cuts
i think its safe
to assume so
but what im more focused on
right now is finding a way
to make this paper
essential to its readers
i like to think
it already is
fair enough i just think
that we can do better
mr bradlee
hey
saw the pd numbers
looks interesting
yeah theres something there
how long do you need
another week
wherere you going
since when
technically
i am an editor
technically
your sitdown with baron
go that well
i couldnt get a read on him
thats a first
how about you
oh hes a barrel of laughs
morning everyone
lets get started
do you wanna
say something marty
uh sure
uh hello
as most of you know by now
my name is marty baron
im delighted to be here
um if you could tell me your name
as we go around thatd be helpful
thank you
okay peter
peter canellos metro
ive got a major
big dig closure
hey steve hey
mike
crappy game
last night huh
yeah they cant hit
worth a nickel
hey listen whats eileen mcnamara
doing in the 1030
do you need something mike
no just curious
go be curious somewhere else
i got work to do huh
okay steve
see you
yeah
and it looks like pedros gonna
be out until september 1st
jimmy says hell be back this year
but the doc didnt seem so sure
whens the pats opener
is that everyone
yes thats it
okay good
thank you uh
did everyone read
eileen mcnamaras column this weekend
thats the geoghan case
yeah whats the folo
on that
its a column what kind
of folo were you thinking
uh well apparently
this priest molested kids
in six different parishes
over the last 30 years
and the attorney
for the victims mr
garabedian
thanks eileen
mr garabedian says
cardinal law found out
about it 15 years ago
and did nothing
yeah i think that
attorneys a bit of a crank
and the church
dismissed the claim
he said she said
whether mr garabedian
is a crank or not
he says he has documents
that prove the cardinal knew
as i understand it
those documents are under seal
okay but the fact remains
a boston priest abused 80 kids
we have a lawyer who says he
can prove law knew about it
and weve written all of uh
two stories in the last six months
this strikes me as an essential
story to a local paper
i think at the very least we have
to go through those documents
how would you
like to do that
oh uh
i dont know
what the laws are here
but in florida
we would go to court
you want to sue the church
technically we wouldnt
sue the church
wed file a motion to lift
the seal on those documents
the church will read that
as us suing them
so will everybody else
good to know
gutsy call
for the first day
thats one word for it
how do you think thats
gonna play down front
i think gilmans
gonna shit a brick
hey
door
howd it go
well baron wants to sue for the
sealed docs in the geoghan case
wants to sue the church
hey thats great
we covered geoghan when the
story broke three years ago
baron was still in miami
i think he might have been
at the times then actually
he wasnt here
so do you think
that suit has a chance
depends on the judge
and what parish he belongs to
bradlee yeah
okay
baron wants to talk to us
us
okay jon thank you
yes okay thanks
ive set up a meeting for
tomorrow with outside counsel
jon albano
yeah
whos the judge
in this case
um
constance sweeney
tough
whys that
good catholic girl
huh
so um
judging from what ive read
it doesnt seem like weve done
a very thorough investigation
into the geoghan case
is that right
no its not
we looked hard at geoghan
david armstrong from metro
michael paulson for religion
okay but uh
just so i understand
beyond our daily coverage
we havent
we havent committed any longterm
investigative resources
to the question of whether or not
cardinal law knew about this
no we havent
and thats the kind of thing
your team would do
spotlight well yeah
but were still prospecting the
boston pd story i told you about
could you set that aside
we could
marty in past spotlights
had success in large part
because they pick
their own projects
would you consider
picking this one
i dont know if
hes writing about you
but i will let him know
you called
okay bye
hey
hey howd it go
okay uh
baron wants us to scrub
the geoghan case
thats great
didnt we cover geoghan
yeah theres a lawyer alleging
cardinal law knew about it
mmm mitch garabedian right
yeah
i covered him
at the courthouse
can you get to him
i only interviewed him once
hes kind of a character
i like characters
ill take him
good you take him
also we should be
talking to uh
the lawyer who repped the
victims in the porter case
eric macleish
uhhuh
that guy was always on tv
yeah the porter case
remind me
yeah um father porter similar story
molested dozens of kids in
fall river about 10 years ago
so were dropping
the boston pd
i vote yes
no no
we just gotta set
it aside for now
listen i dont need
to tell you guys this
we need to be more
discreet than usual
all right
everybodys gonna be interested in this
not just the herald
we cant let cardinal law get wind
of this until we know what we have
good luck with that
so when
do you leave nana
the bus is picking us up in the
church parking lot at 900
we have 40 people going
and is father dominic going
no he says
hes unlucky
but luck has nothing
to do with it
you know last time nana won 160
wow
you gonna tell her
we dont even know
if theres a story yet
well globe sues church
its gonna be a story
hey lisa could you pull all the
relevant clips on that for me
yeah
is this for spotlight
just drop them off
when theyre ready thanks
excuse me do you know where
the publishers office is
will do
how are you marty
settling in
yeah i think so
good
what can i do for you
um
id like to challenge the protective
order in the geoghan case
you want to sue
the catholic church
um
were just
filing a motion but
yes
you think
its that important
yes i do
because obviously the church
will fight us very hard on this
which wont go unnoticed
by our subscriber base
53 of them are catholic
mmmhmm
i think
theyll be interested
okay
marty lake street
will probably contact you
about a facetoface
with the cardinal
its customary
yeah they already have
its set up for next week
i wouldnt mention this
hello
hello
can i help you
oh hi
im mike rezendes
from the boston globe
im here to see
mitchell garabedian
hes on a call
please have a seat
okay
all right im listening
go ahead
okay
bill where the hell
are those papers
i asked you to
put em on my desk
the famous walter robinson
in my conference room
good to see you again eric
sacha pfeiffer
eric macleish
nice to meet you
nice to meet you
you dont play golf
do you
uh no
good
your colleague here
took some money off me
at a charity event
last year
it was a very lucky putt i actually
had my eyes closed by the way
mmmhmm
so how can i help
you guys
uh
youre familiar
with the geoghan case
sure
eighty plaintiffs
all of them individual cases
garabedian must be swimming
well and the allegations
against cardinal law
yeah its tricky um
this is what you need to understand
these are shitty cases
the statute of limitations
is only three years
and most of these victims dont
come forward until long after that
oh why is that
well theyre kids
you know
guilt shame
and most of these kids come
from tough neighborhoods
nobody wants to admit
this kind of thing
so youre screwed
on the time limit
and uh
even if you argue
your way around that
the charitable immunity statute
caps damages at 20 grand
twenty grand for
molesting a child
that is the way
the system is set up yes
the church is tough
so your best shot
is to try these cases
in the press
like i did on porter
hmm but you know
most of the victims
they dont wanna have
anything to do with tv
and uh
mitch isnt exactly
a people person
yeah and if garabedian
cant get his victims
to go before the press
then hes really
thats right
he has a long road ahead of him
my guess is he doesnt
have anything on law
what you think
hes bluffing or
i think hes grandstanding
to cut a better deal
seems a bit reckless
have you met
mitch garabedian
i asked you to write up that motion
bill i didnt ask you to file it
hey bill heres
the case files from yesterday
hi
who are you
im mike rezendes from the boston globe
i had an appointment
with you about an hour ago
i cant talk to you
im very busy sharon
no no she went out for coffee
she said shed be right back
im following up
on an article
the one in the phoenix
no in the globe
did you see
the one in the phoenix
no i didnt
i thought it was very good
i have a copy here somewhere
thats all right
ill track it down
im actually
following up on a column
that eileen mcnamara
wrote about your suit
suits
there are 84 of them
its not a class action
you should get your facts straight
no youre right i should
so im trying to get some
background information on
youre not
recording this are you
no i wouldnt do
that without asking
i cant show you those churchs
documents if thats what youre after
theyre under seal
yeah i know that
did you know that
they tried to bring me up
before the massachusetts board
of bar overseers three times
theyre watching me
very closely
the church
yeah the church yeah
theyd like to get me disbarred
in fact put that away
put it away
sure
i dont want you recording this
in any way shape or form
not on paper
not on tape nothing
in fact i probably shouldnt
even be speaking to you so
look mr garabedian
i know theres things
you cannot tell me
but i also know
theres a story here
and i think
its an important story
i already talked
to the phoenix
yeah and theres a reason
i didnt see it
nobody reads
the phoenix anymore
theyre broke
they dont have any power
the globe does
if we cover this story
everybody will hear about it
the church thinks
in centuries mr rezendes
do you think your paper has the
resources to take that on
yeah i do
but if you dont
mind me asking
do you
i cant talk to you right now
mr rezendes im very very busy
sharon yeah
thank you
can i at least talk to some
of your clients the victims
id really like
to do that
call me tomorrow i gotta think about it
thank you
thanks
yeah yeah
i got more clips
from the library
leave em right there
are you guys doing
a story on the church
no we are not doing
a story on the church
matt you find anything
on this guy phil saviano
no who is he
hes part of
a victims organization
kurkjian did a story on him
right after the porter case
theres a victims
organization
yeah its called snap
its survivors network
of those abused by priests
crummy acronym
hmm
you want me to track him down
yeah bring him in
how much longer you need
to get through the clips
i mean a few days
theres a lot
lisas still sending up more
okay
hey guys i think i got
another priest
liam barrett
molested some kids in philly
and was moved to boston
did the same thing
and was moved again
really
that sounds like geoghan
is that one of our clips
yeah bylines
diego ribadeneira 1997
mustve been back when
he was working religion
was there any folo
not much one short piece
huh
the church settled the case
dont you know
jim sullivan
yeah why
looks like the church
brought him in to help out
jesus
has anybody but manny gotten
the ball out of the infield
nope why do you even
bother with that thing
it distracts me
from the game
know what else
is good for that
oh yeah good idea
my round ill be right back
anybody want any food
no
im all set
hey a hot dog
so you guys
making any progress
absolutely its a good story
why
because youre another lapsed
catholic pissed off at the church
weve got a lot of good stuff
like what
im just watching the game
omertà
they got another priest
liam barrett
we reported on him
im just saying we did
okay
but this guy was shuffled around from
parish to parish every few years
just like geoghan
and porter
i think theres a pattern
sounds thin
what else you got
sachas got another guy from a
victims organization phil saviano
from snap oh boy
we reported on him too
i thought you were watching
the game steve
that guys pretty
banged up mike
we did a couple
stories on him
that guy would not
stop writing letters
he wants a holy war
what so hes not
worth talking to
where are you
on garabedian
im working on it
robby said macleish
thinks hes bluffing
i think theres
something there ben
get me something solid
or im taking you off it
i dont want us chasing
our tails on this
stay away
from that trap
you couldnt reach that
trap in a million years partner
ive reached that trap before
yeah now paul maybe
how we doing
were good
were two up in the front
good
hows that new editor
working out
well he doesnt
like baseball
but he seems like
a smart guy
yeah i read an article
about him
said hes the first
jewish editor at the globe
must have been
a slow news day
he got a family
this guy
no he is not married
divorced
i dont think so no
so the new editor of the globe is an
unmarried man of the jewish faith
who hates baseball
yeah
should have given it to ben
hes a bradlee
for crying out loud
didnt raise his hand
fast enough i guess
hey by the way
ive been reading about this priest
father barrett
said you were
involved with that
barrett yeah bad egg
lake street asked
for help i pitched in
victims said cardinal law knew about
barrett when he came from philly
is that true
you know i cant talk
about the case robby
off the record
off the record
i cant talk about it
all right
this related to the lawsuit
you know about that
look
i dont know this guy baron
or what his agenda is
frankly i dont care
i just dont want to see you
taking a bullet for him
i think youre away
put it over here
lets go lets go
so the other day
i was on the world wide web
anything you want to know
its right there
now i have to admit
that as a priest
this makes me
a little nervous
should i be worried
about job security
i dont think so
you see
knowledge is one thing
but faith
faith is another
hey
hey
shouldnt you be
golfing or something
golfings not a verb
and i couldnt get
a tee time
is that what they call it
tee time
they also call it a leisure activity
you ought to try it mike
i do i run
yeah you run to work
so why are you here today
going over these clips
of saviano
yep ben and steve
think its a dead end
they gave me a bunch of
crap about it at the game
yeah ben emailed me
he did
yeah
he said we should
let it go
what do you wanna do
i wanna bring saviano in
so just ignore those guys
i think weve got to start
ignoring everybody on this one
im good with that
mmm
do you think marty has any idea
whats coming down the pike
nope i dont think
he cares either
thats refreshing
yeah
unless hes wrong
ive always been
fascinated with the newspaper business
i used to sit in on the lectures
with the nieman fellows
when i was at harvard
i read that you were
an editor once
oh yes
yeah that was
a very long time ago
the mississippi register
small diocesan newspaper
but for a 30yearold pastor
it was a big responsibility
too much at times
how so
i was close with
the evers brothers
we took a stand
on civil rights
our readership
was not pleased
they saw me
as a meddling outsider
i can imagine
tough seat to sit in
especially in a small town
i think youll find that bostons
still a small town too marty
in many ways
but if i can be of any help
marty dont hesitate to ask
i find that
the city flourishes
when its great institutions
work together
thank you
personally im of the opinion that for
a paper to best perform its function
it really needs
to stand alone
ah of course
but my offer still stands
thank you
come in
ah
thank you maureen
a little gift marty
think of it as a cardinals
guide to the city of boston
im here to see
sacha pfeiffer
your name
phil saviano
okay just a minute
so am i the first
survivor youve talked to
yeah phil
you are
okay well
first of all let me say thank you
for having me in today
and i want you to know
that you have the full cooperation
of my organization snap
how many members are in
your organization phil
we had 11 at
our last chapter meeting
uh no 10
karen just moved
you had a woman
in your group
of course there was a woman
they dont discriminate
not when it comes to abuse
and this has nothing
to do with being gay
what this is is priests using
the collar to rape kids
kids boys and girls
i was 11
and i was preyed upon by father
david holley in worcester
and i dont mean prayed for
i mean preyed upon
are any of you catholic
i was raised catholic
now i go to my wifes presbyterian church
im lapsed
i go to church with
my grandmother sometimes
its safe to say we were all
raised catholic but now
not so much
okay well
let me tell you
when youre a poor kid from a poor
family religion counts for a lot
and when a priest pays attention
to you its a big deal
he asks you to collect
the hymnals
or take out the trash
you feel special
its like god
asking for help
so maybe its a little weird
when he tells you a dirty joke
but now you got a secret
together so you go along
then he shows you a porno mag
and you go along
and you go along
and you go along
until one day he asks you to jerk
him off or give him a blow job
and so you go along
with that too
because you feel trapped
because he has groomed you
how do you say
no to god right
see
it is important to understand that
this is not just physical abuse
its spiritual abuse too
and when a priest does this to you
he robs you of your faith
so you reach for
the bottle or the needle
or if those dont work
you jump off a bridge
thats why we call
ourselves survivors
have you read
jason berrys book
he wrote about the gauthe
case in louisiana
uh thats g
gauthe
here and talk to
richard sipe
he worked in one of the
churchs treatment centers
hes an expriest
married a nun
here
this is his testimony
from the kos case
uh phil
whats a treatment center
its where they send priests
when they get caught
this is all right here
in the box
i sent this all to you guys
five years ago
uh to the globe
who did you send it to
i dont wanna say who but they
said that they werent interested
uh but phil we did run a
couple of stories on you
i saw them in the clips
yeah but to be completely frank
it wasnt enough
you guys gotta understand
this is big
this is not just boston its the
whole country its the whole world
and it goes right
up to the vatican
do you have any
proof of that phil
no not yet but think about it
there are so many of them
how else could they have
hidden it for so long
so many what
priests
priests
i know of 13
right here in boston
you know 13 priests in boston
who have molested children
yeah why do you keep
repeating everything i say
i just like to
clarify things
maybe you should have
clarified it five years ago
when i sent you
all of this stuff
its all right here
may i use your bathroom
yeah sure phil
come on
well what do you think
well the guy hes got an agenda
thats for sure
you think
hes obviously been through a lot
but hes smart and if hes
right about 13 priests
yeah it might be
a big if with this guy
do a background check
on him
and follow up with some of the
other survivors of his group
ill track down
this expriest sipe
okay but stay on garabedian
thats more important
garabedian
what a pain in the ass
you can be a pain
in the ass mike

well he was very nice
at first
very funny very casual
and i think he could tell
i was gay
so he showed me this mobile he had
like over a babys crib
mmmhmm
but with different words
homosexual
transsexual bisexual
okay and did you know you
were gay at that time joe
yeah
but that wasnt information
i was sharing with anybody
not in dorchester
okay
so what happened after
he showed you the mobile
well i was
a little freaked out
mmmhmm
i think he could tell
so he said you know whatll
help is if we play strip poker
course i lost
and uh things went on
from there
can you tell me
specifically what happened
specifically he
he molested me
joe i think that the language is
going to be so important here
we cant sanitize this
just saying molest isnt enough
people need to know
what actually happened
we should probably get these to go
right
geoghan shows up
and my mom you know shes
shes thrilled
i mean
this was like god
showing up you know
sure right
so what happened then
you really want to
hear this shit
yeah yeah patrick i do
he offers to take me
to get ice cream
and you know hes a priest
im a kid so i go
sure
so were driving home and he
he starts patting my leg
you know then
his hand just slides right up
and he grabs my dick
you know i just froze up
i was fucking petrified i couldnt move
i didnt know what to do
i was just a little kid
yeah
you know i never even
touched my ice cream
it just melted down my arm
did you um
did you see him again
after that
yeah
all right thats good
lets stop there for now
sure
he said it was a way to make me
more comfortable with my body
mmm
so what happened
after that
well he took off his
clothes and he said
ive been so depressed
but maybe you can cheer me
up and give me a blow job
classy guy
and did you
yeah
i know what you must be thinking
like why would i ever do that
to some creepy guy whos 30
years older than me but
what you have to understand is that
this is the first time in my life
that someone told me that it
was okay to be gay mmmhmm
and it was a priest
right
so you had oral sex
did you have intercourse
yes
not then but later
it really
messed me up
im sober now but that
that was the beginning of it all
its very confusing
you know
to be introduced to sex
like that and then
and then to be
attracted to men its
im sorry
i knew i was gonna do this
oh im sorry
dont be sorry
its okay joe
its okay
of course there is a
church right there
and a playground
joe did you ever
try and tell anyone
like who a priest
can i use your phone
yeah sure
you know where it is
you can use my name
if you want
thanks patrick
dont thank me
just get these assholes will you
hes one of the lucky ones
hes still alive
do you want
a cup of tea sacha
im okay nana thanks
okay
hello
hi joe its sacha pfeiffer
hi sacha how are you
im good thanks
listen joe i just wanted
to follow up on one thing
you talked to phil saviano
about all of this right
yeah i did
i went to a couple of snap meetings
and did phil ever suggest
you do anything about it
no
the meetings
werent really about that
i mean a couple of them
had gone to a lawyer
but i didnt think
it was worth it
why not
there were just so
many forms to fill out
it was overwhelming
you know
and he said it could only get
me a small settlement so
who who said that
the lawyer told me that
so you did go
and see a lawyer
yeah but i didnt
end up using him
so i didnt think
it was important
im sorry im not
trying to hide anything
no i know joe
do remember his name
the lawyer
no but maybe phil
would know
the guy was on tv a lot
during the porter case
he was handsome
was it eric macleish
yeah thats it macleish
i thought
he was very handsome
hey
hey
i was just in the newsroom
judge sweeney set a date for the hearing
really when
two weeks in springfield
canellos started a pool
ten bucks to get in
anyone picking the globe
hes only taking bets on how
fast sweeney rules against us
robby
hi its me
did you get my message
i did
looks like father shanley
could be our fourth priest
yeah i think he is
did you follow up
with macleish
i just talked to phil
he said macleish dealt with
a number of these cases
guess he forgot to mention that
yeah
im gonna go to
the courthouse tomorrow
see if i can find any cases he
settled against the church
all right call me
after you do good night
okay good night
hey
you wanted to chat
yeah im late for a dinner
you wanna walk me out
sure
jeez
does this guy ever go home
apparently not
i got guys who wont leave
till he does
hes wearing out the goddamn newsroom
where are we on geoghan
following up
on more victims
hey i want to expand
the investigation
why
we got a fourth priest
there might be
as many as 13
thirteen
yeah
whos your source
phil saviano
oh jesus christ robby i told mike
i know i know
i think saviano
might be legit ben
you wanna elaborate
on that
no not really
it just feels like this things
stacking up its my gut
okay
okay good
thank you
hello
mr rezendes
uh yeah whos this
its richard sipe
oh yeah hey richard how are you
im good
uh thanks
for calling look
phil saviano
gave me your name
i was wondering if i can
ask you a few questions
of course yeah
great
so phil told me
that you were working
at one of the churchs treatment
centers in baltimore
yes the seton
psychiatric institute
it was run by
the daughters of charity
and uh
when was that richard
well i started my psychotherapy
fellowship there in 1965
and i was there
for five years
but i spent the next 30 studying
abusive priests and their victims
really
mmmhmm
and thats been
your sole focus
look mike
the church wants us to believe
that its just a few bad apples
but its a much
bigger problem than that
how much bigger richard
well based on the research
i would classify it as a
recognizable psychiatric phenomenon
thats big
hey mac
hey
if i wanted historical
data on a priest
parishes hed been
assigned to
where would i find that
the geoghan case its all in the clips
lisa has the source material
yeah what if it was
for another priest
one that hadnt been
in the papers
youre looking at another priest
whore you looking at
any ideas
oh come on matt
youre not going to tell me
i gotta get to a meeting
thanks mac
hey steve
the archdiocese puts
out an annual directory
every priest and parish
thats great
do these go back
any further than 98
oh yeah going back to
the 80s in the mez
beyond that you gotta
go to the bpl
in the mez huh thanks lisa
you bet
he said they all target
the same kind of kid
lowincome families
absentee fathers broken homes
so a guy like geoghan goes after
boys not because he prefers them
but because they have
more shame
less likely to talk
these guys
are predators robby
and i talked to sipe
he said hed seen dozens of them
in the 60s in seton
he called it
a phenomenon
why didnt he go public
he did
but the church made a huge
effort to discredit him
smear campaigns
public statements by prominent bishops
its just like saviano said
and garabedian
you getting anywhere
with him
more victims
more victims
you cant empty his pockets
ill get to him
i just need more time
oh come on mike
you gotta get him
ill get him ill get him
jesus what the hell
is that smell
theres a dead rat
in the corner
what have you got
church directories
its every priest
in massachusetts
what parish
theyre assigned to
are these official
yeah
i figured it could
help us track down
some of the priests
that saviano mentioned
maybe find
some more victims
can we turn on some more lights
i couldnt find the switch
you wanna borrow my glasses
no im good im good
look 1983 john geoghan
st brendan parish dorchester
so we can find out where any
priest is in any given year
yeah i got him here at
huh
what
1980 the year geoghan was pulled from jp
it says hes on sick leave
come on
it really says that
where is uh 1991
here ya go
let me see this
barrett barrett liam
i cant read that
look for a liam barrett in there
1991s the year they pulled
him out of charlestown
barrett liam
yeah
sick leave
its an official designation
lets get these upstairs
and matt check on those
priests saviano gave us
robby yeah
hey im down at the courthouse
somethings not right here
nothing on shanley either sacha
okay thanks
yeah we need to go talk
to macleish again
really why
huh theres nothing here
there arent any records
i checked every name
thanks for waiting so sorry guys
stuck on a call
not a problem
how are you good
thanks for meeting us
you bet whats up guys
mr macleish are you familiar
with a priest named paul shanley
yes i am familiar
with him
and have you settled cases
against father shanley
as im sure you can understand
i cant discuss that with you
how about uh
father ronald paquin
well i cant discuss that with you either
come on guys
we understand youve settled several
cases against each of them
even if id been involved
in those cases
the settlements
would be confidential
and i could be disbarred for
acknowledging their existence
okay
mmmhmm
look i told you guys
these are tough cases
most of these folks they
just want some acknowledgment
of what happened
we got em a sitdown with the
bishop and a little dough
and thats the best
they could hope for
well its certainly the best
the priests could hope for
no the church promised theyd take
the priests out of circulation
and did you follow up
on that
do you guys
need anything else
yes why arent there
any records
i was down at
the courthouse earlier
there arent any records
of any of these settlements
we dealt directly
with the church
we would draw up a demand letter
and send it to the chancery
you never filed
anything in court
its a private mediation
so this is just you
and the archdioceses lawyers
in a room
correct
anyone else
occasionally the church would bring in
another defense attorney to help out
you have names
nope
no i dont
so this was all
under the table
theres no paper trail
at all
the victim has to sign
a confidentiality agreement
to get the settlement
the lawyer takes a third and the
church sweeps it under the rug
jeez
its a freakin racket
its more complicated
than that
macleishs got a duty to the client
to get the best deal he can
sure but how many victims do
you represent and profit from
before you say something
garabedian would say none
thats why hes taking
these cases to court
because he wants people
to know about this
i agree
and legal ethics aside ben
i mean operating
the way macleish has
all but guarantees that the
abuse stays under wraps
yeah did macleish confirm
all savianos priests
no hes limited by his
confidentiality agreement
but clearly hes settled cases
against a number of them
phils put me in touch with
some of the other victims
im pretty confident all of his
priests are gonna check out
so it is 13 priests
yeah
looks that way
holy shit
okay keep going
im sorry
what was the name again
uh baron
baron
im having trouble finding it
just give me a second
its okay kim
i can vouch for him
im pete conley im on the
board of catholic charities
welcome to boston
mr baron
thank you
i appreciate you joining us
were very proud of the
work we do here at boston
oh the cardinal said
you had a nice visit
yes we did
hes an extraordinary man
im glad you had a chance to chat
enjoying yourself
uh to be honest these events
arent really my strong suit
yeah are you involved
with the charity
not directly no
several of my friends are
we all went to high school
bc high
thats the school across
the street from the globe
its hard to miss
yeah
hard to get away from
too apparently
the cardinals in the corner
if youre so inclined
weve met
really
did he mention the suit
no but he did give me a
copy of the catechism
yeah well the cardinals
not known for his subtlety
during the porter investigation
hed literally called down the
power of god on the globe
howd that play out
a week later our editor
broke his leg skiing
shrimp toast
gentlemen
no thanks
no
you said one of the victims
filed a criminal complaint
yeah there were
a few of them
but the judge had
the case records sealed
after friends of
the church complained
and the church has
a lot of friends
like eric macleish
yeah
lets just say hes not
part of the solution
you follow what im saying
sure
you work hard
mr rezendes
are you married
yeah
your wife doesnt mind you
working all the time
oh yeah she does
thats why i never got married
im too busy
what i do
is too important
hmm
your new editor
hes a jew right
oh thats right yeah
yeah see
he comes in and suddenly everybodys
interested in the church
you know why
because it takes
an outsider like me
im armenian
how many armenians
do you know in boston
steve kurkjian
works at the globe
oh thats two
you should get a prize or something
what are you italian
no im portuguese
from where
east boston
really east boston
you dont sound like it
this city these people
making the rest of us
feel like we dont belong
but theyre no better
than us
look at how they treat
their children
mark my words
mr rezendes
if it takes a village
to raise a child
it takes a village
to abuse one
hey here he is want a beer
love one
another
you here with barbara
no she hates these things
karen too
yeah
smart ladies
sláinte
mmm
i met your new editor
seemed like a decent fellow
i think he is
hey i had an interesting conversation
with eric macleish the other day
turns out hes been settling abuse
cases with the archdiocese for years
you really wanna
talk about this here
jim you said you helped out
on father barrett as a favor
that was a oneoff
how many of these cases
have you been involved with
you know i cant answer that robby
its unethical
is that all it is
so this would be
the robby robinson
ive always heard about
but never met
listen to me jimmy
you wanna be on
the right side of this
this is the church
youre talking about robby
look around
these are good people
done a lot of good
for this city
enjoy the party
ive been through
a lot of these now
sick leave isnt the
only designation they use
when they take one of these
priests out of circulation
they use a slew of terms
absent on leave
unassigned
emergency response
they got a word for everything these guys
hmm except rape
and they move parishes way more
frequently than other priests
when i was a kid
a priest moved
after seven or eight years
sometimes longer
these guys its two
to three years tops
and did they use these designations
for all of savianos priests
yeah its a pretty
clear pattern
guys i got sipe
i think if you really
want to understand the crisis
you need to start with
the celibacy requirement
that was my first
major finding
only 50 of the clergy
are celibate
now most of them are having
sex with other adults
but the fact remains that this
creates a culture of secrecy
that tolerates and
even protects pedophiles
so you believe the church is aware
of the extent of this crisis
oh absolutely after the first
major scandal in louisiana
tom doyle the secretarycanonist
for the papal nuncio
coauthored a report
warning pedophile priests
were a
billiondollar liability
that was in 1985
thats right
who saw that report
anyone from the catholic hierarchy
sure
doyle tried to introduce
the report at
the national conference
of catholic bishops
in fact cardinal law initially
helped to fund the report
but then he backed out
and they shelved it
are you kidding me
richard robby here
we think we have 13 priests in
boston that fit this pattern
which would be
a very very big story
does that sound right to you
in terms of scale
no not really robby
it sounds low to me
my estimates suggest 6 act
out sexually with minors
uh 6 of what
6 of all priests
how many priests
do we have in boston
about 1500
1 is 15
6 is
all right 90 priests
is that possible
from a metric standpoint
yes that would certainly be
in line with my findings
hello
uh
ninety fucking priests
in boston
thats what he said
if there were 90 of these bastards
people would know
maybe they do
and no one said a thing
good germans
i dont think thats a comparison
you want to make publically
macleish knew
he just didnt say anything
thats 13 priests
theres a big difference
between 13 and 90
wheres this guy sipe
getting his numbers
well hes been studying
it for 30 years
he is a trained
psychotherapist
okay but we need something
more than a metric
from some hippy expriest
whos shacking up with a nun
okay so well track down more victims
well get more priests
then we can check them
against the directories
thats a shitload
of victims
well get there
how longs it gonna take
too long
wait but
meetings over
yeah for now
look whatve you got
what if we work backwards
what do you mean from what
from the directories
weve been using them
to confirm bad priests
what if we do it
the other way around
use the directories to identify
bad priests yeah exactly
we search by designation
we look for any priest on
sick leave or unassigned
or have been moved around a lot
yeah
its gonna take
a load of work
well not if were
all on it
you too
generally thats what all means yeah
yeah generally
library is closing
library is closing
holy shit
no freakin way
talbot
yeah
tivnan
yeah
toma
yeah
turnbull
yeah
walsh
yeah
welsh
yeah
thats it
thats it
holy shit
robby
thats three off sipes estimate
thats incredible
robby
how many
eightyseven
eightyseven priests
in boston
call macleish i wanna talk to him
okay
can you print it
sure can
jim sullivans office
yeah walter robinson
for jim sullivan
tell him its important
please
one moment please
hey robby
everything okay
i need you
to tell me something jim
could it be 90 priests
what
could it be as high as 90
jesus robby
i need to know jim i wouldnt
be asking if it wasnt important
you gotta stop this robby
robby macleishs assistant said
hes all booked up he cant see us
yeah well the hell
he cant
all right
thatll be fun
you know what
ill catch up with you okay
were good
hey guys
im really sorry i am
but i dont have any time
to talk right now
but if you call
my assistant
mr macleish
we have reason to believe
that there are allegations against
as many as 87 priests in boston
i cant talk to you
about that
does that number sound right to you
you gotta be kidding me
i just told you i dont have
time for this crap right now
eric how many priests
did you settle
robby you know
i cant tell you that
youre gonna give me the names
and the names of their victims
are you threatening me
weve got two stories here
weve got a story
about degenerate clergy
and weve got a story
about a bunch of lawyers
turning child abuse
into a cottage industry
now which story
do you want us to write
cause were writing
one of them
i already sent you
a list of names
whatre you talking about
to whom
the globe years ago
after the porter case
i got plenty of calls
i had 20 priests
in boston alone
but i couldnt go after them
without the press
so i sent you guys a list of names
and you buried it
i want those names tomorrow
check your
goddamn clips robby
we didnt find
anything in the clips
yeah big surprise
richard do you still
go to mass
no no i havent been
to church for some time now
but i still
consider myself a catholic
how does that work
well the church
is an institution mike
made of men
its passing
my faith is in the eternal
i try to separate the two
sounds tricky
it is
especially since the church
continues to go after me
it takes a toll mike
theyll try to silence
anyone who speaks out
im sure theyll come after you
and your team soon enough
really and how do you think
theyll do that
hello
richard
who is it
its the archbishop
of canterbury
i had dinner at santarpios
had some leftovers
ah youre the freakin best
thanks you want a beer
yeah
you got it
jesus
how much longer you gonna be
in this shithole
yeah im working on it
shes a good girl mike
yeah she is
well figure it out
i havent had
a lot of time lately
i just got off the phone
with sipe actually
have you met this guy
in person yet
no but his knowledge of this
is on a whole other level
im freaking starving
so where are we
with the 90
were close
how close
were close
just answer the question will you
we got 87 names
were trying to get confirmation
i think we will
something bugging you
its just surprising
thats all
yeah yeah it is
for everybody
oh hey ben
i forgot to ask you
phil saviano said he sent a bunch of
info over to the globe years ago
do you have any idea to who
no why
well im just curious
i wanted to see
if theres any leads
you guys didnt run out
saviano was a fucking train
wreck five years ago mike
we didnt miss anything
this story needed spotlight
yeah i agree
im just following up
good night
yeah good night
this is unbelievable
when did you get this
macleish emailed
the list this morning
he settled cases
against 45 priests
where are we on law
anything that shows he
had knowledge of this
were still working garabedian
but nothing concrete
i keep thinking about that
conversation we had the other night
about how law called
down the power of god
when we reported on porter
thats just law
being law
okay but i checked the clips
and uh porter isnt even
in the boston archdiocese
hes from fall river
so
why the extreme reaction
law had to know
thats why he
had the reaction
because he knew
there were others
i think thats
the bigger story
bigger than 50 priests
if it came from
the top down yes
but the numbers
clearly indicate
that there were senior
clergy involved
thats all they do
indicate
are you telling me
that if we run a story
with 50 pedophile
priests in boston
mike
well get into the same cat
fight you got into on porter
which made a lot of noise
but changed things
not one bit
we need to focus on the institution
not the individual priests
practice and policy
show me the church
manipulated the system
so that these guys wouldnt
have to face charges
show me they put
those same priests
back into parishes
time and time again
show me this was systemic
that it came
from the top down
sounds like were
going after law
were going
after the system
make a list of all the victims we have
start reaching out
and bring matt in if you need help
mmmhmm
okay hey when you
go to springfield
our hearing is monday
okay
hey robby
you got a second
yeah
i uh got one of those
treatment centers
a block from
my house

a cousin in quincy

the bishop came
over to the house
he said nothing like this
had ever happened before
and he asked us
not to press charges
and what did
your mother do
my mother
she put out
freakin cookies
there was a lot of
pressure to keep quiet
from the church
yeah from
the church
but not just
the church
from my friends
from the other
parishioners
well many of
the priests that i treated
were psychosexually stunted
on the emotional level
of a 12 or 13yearold
jeez
sure the chief knew
everybody knew
but nobody wants
to cuff a priest
mmm
and what about
the prosecutor
i shouldnt talk
about this shit
i think you should
actually
do you know a father hurley
or a father gale

i swear to god
ill beat the shit out of you
sorry to bother you

could i ask you
a few questions
go ahead dear
we spoke to several men who
you knew when they were boys
at st john the baptist
in haverhill
they told us you molested them
is that true
sure i fooled around
but i never felt gratified myself
right um but you
admit to molesting boys
at st john the baptist
yes yes
but as i said
i never got
any pleasure from it
thats important
to understand
right
um but can you
tell me where and how
you fooled around
with these boys
i want to be clear
i never raped anyone
theres a difference

no you wont
i beat you last time
no you didnt
you cheated
you did
could you please clarify the globes
position for me mr albano
yes judge sweeney
our argument to make
these documents public
rests mainly on
first amendment grounds
we also have a number
of other relevant arguments
after all your honor
this was a
discretionary order
yes it was made
at the judges discretion
hey mike
hey joe
whats a
spotlight reporter
doing in springfield
your boy albanos
sledding uphill
you actually think you have a
shot at winning this thing
you want me to comment
for the herald
globe reporter
would not comment
but he did not
seem hopeful
he didnt try
and hide it at all
he had this really odd
rationalization for it
like it was
totally normal
to fool around
with little boys
id really like to go back
i think hed talk to us
oh we will
just not yet
i want you to stay focused
on the victims right now
sacha whered they send
father talbot again
um i think
wasnt that cheverus
cheverus thats right
wait father talbot
from bc high
yeah you know him
yeah he was there
when i was
we have a victim
yeah lives
in providence
theres nothing personal in
these documents your honor
they concern how the
cardinal is handling
say the archdiocese
excuse me
you dont get to
tag the cardinal
with everything
mr albano
say the archdiocese
judge sweeney the globe
is not a party to this case
they just want
to sell papers
if mr garabedian
had not smeared
the cardinals
good name
we wouldnt even be here
your honor i object to the
use of the word smear
duly noted
mr garabedian
thank you your honor
anything else
mr rogers
no your honor
mr albano
you may continue
the globe
believes having
hey mitch
how are you doing
im fine
hes tough
that wilson rogers
hes smug
and hes sloppy
he doesnt seem sloppy
you dont know the half of it
trust me
whats the
half of it
tell me the
half of it mitch
off the record
off the record yeah
three years ago
i get a call from an expriest
anthony benzevich
he was at blessed
sacrament back in 62
and he saw geoghan
taking little boys up to
the rectory bedroom okay
so hes appalled
all right
tells the bishop
about it
the bishop threatens
to reassign him
to south america
jesus
yeah all right
so fast forward 35 years
benzevich reads that
geoghans been charged
with molesting
hundreds of kids
all right so he feels guilty
he calls me
so you have
testimony of a priest
telling his superiors
about geoghan in 62
no i do not
because when i called benzevich
in to give a deposition
he comes in
with a lawyer
wilson rogers
right
and suddenly
father benzevich
has a very foggy memory
cant remember anything
hes useless
so i go back to work
i forget about it
whatever
until about a year ago
i find an article
about a priest who warned
church officials about geoghan
benzevich went to the press
yeah
yeah local paper patriot ledger
nobody saw it
but now i got
benzevich on record
so i file a motion to depose
benzevich a second time
all right
and wilson rogers
that smug son of a bitch
he files a motion
opposing my motion
and thats when
i have him
have him how
rogers opposes my motion
so i have to
make an argument
as to why im
allowed to depose
father benzevich
a second time okay
but this time
im allowed to attach exhibits
do you follow
what im saying
the sealed documents
yes
i can attach
the sealed documents
that ive gotten in discovery
mr rezendes
the same documents that your
paper is currently suing for
youre shitting me
what
no no im not shitting you
so i pull out the 14
most damning docs
and i attach em
to my motion
and they prove
everything everything
about the church
about the bishops about law
and its all public
because your motion
to oppose rogers motion
is public
yeah exactly
now youre
paying attention
so i could just walk into
that courthouse right now
and get those documents
no you cannot
because the documents
are not there
but you just
said theyre public
i know i did
but this is boston
and the church does not
want them to be found
so they are not there
mitch are you telling me
that the catholic church
removed legal documents
from that courthouse
look im not crazy
im not paranoid
im experienced
check the docket
youll see
they control everything
everything
i gotta go back in
these guys got
the fucking documents
docket entry number 49
its in the geoghan case
were closing
in 10 minutes
ten minutes
all right
robby
hey its me
hey
youre not gonna believe it
garabedian gave me a tip
some of the sealed docs are already public
theyre part of
a motion he filed
he said theyre
the best of the bunch
we dont have to wait
for sweeneys ruling
so we can get them
yeah but theyre not there
already talked to albano
he said all we have
to do is file a motion
and sweeney will order mitch
to refile the docs
and you think
these documents are
he said these 14 docs were all we need
theyre huge
okay ill call ben
good work
whether
this was truly an accident
or someone committed
an intentional act
but either way
extensive damage
has been done
to this building
what happened
theyre saying
its a prop plane
but thats not
a prop plane
tell linda to get every
reporter we have in here now
you pray for the victims
you pray for the injured
and you pray for
those who survived
you pray too for the nation
that our response to this might reflect
the best ideals of our nation
and even more
reflect gods own teaching
not only as its shown
in christianity and judaism
but in islam as well
not bad whos there
paulson
i wanna talk to him
when hes back

other newspapers are not my concern
i received a judicial order
i told you the church
is watching me
oh hey mitch please
all i needs a few more weeks
i cant make any promises
goodbye
mitch mitch shit
shit
look i get it
no one wants to read
about kids getting
raped by priests
especially now
but you asked a lot
of people to relive
some very
painful experiences
and you just disappear
phil you know why we were
taken off of the story
its been six weeks
since 911
i realize that and were
gonna get back to it
when
youre doing the same thing
you guys did last time
no
youre dropping us
no maybe i should tell
the herald that story
okay phil
you go ahead and do that
it will undo all the work weve done
but i cant stop you
listen to me
i am here because i care
were not going away
were gonna tell this story
were gonna tell it right
we just need a little more time
thats all were asking for
why bother asking
youre gonna do
what you want anyway
you always do
phil
phil
hey
hows south beach
boynton beach
remarkably different place
whats up
mitch garabedian
called me today
whyd he call you
cause he knew youd yell at him
he refiled the docs
what
robby those docs
are public now
we gotta get there
before anyone else does
i know i know i know
just wrap up
whatever youre doing
and get
the first flight out
ill book a flight now and go
straight to the courthouse tomorrow
all right call me when you get in
okay
robby id like to let phil saviano
know that were back on it
good idea
go have dinner with hansi
might be the last time
for a while
mmmhmm
robby after
we saw macleish
i started going
back through the clips
and i had a little time
last week finally
so um i found that
its from 93
that it
yeah yeah thats it
good night
okay good night
so i was probably a few
years after you right
no you were
more than a few
believe me
well after bc high
i came down to providence
and played hockey
for the friars
oh well you must
have been pretty good
no rode the bench in college
yeah oh
but i loved the city
oh
and we just had our third kid
and i still get my globe
for the record
oh thats good to know
good to know
look kevin uh
thats actually why im here
i need to ask you some
questions about father talbot
howd you find out
well
i guess
it doesnt matter
and i never even
told my wife
excuse me
hey hey hey hey hey hey
i need to get in there
were closed come on let me in
five minutes
im sorry were closed
come on five minutes
hello
here
this is the geoghan case
thats right
those records are sealed
no
thats a public motion
those records are public
look i work for the globe
good for you
can i talk to
your supervisor
hes not in today
what about a judge
there must be judges that
work on this kind of thing
sixth floor
we understand the nature of the
allegations against father talbot
im just not sure what you
want from president kemeza
talbot taught here long
before bill took over
mmm of course
we just want to know
if its possible
that the president
the faculty the board
that no one knew what was
going on at the time
i graduated in 1979 and i had
no idea about any of this
so if youre suggesting that
father gibbons and father callahan
had in any way
gibbons and callahan
i mean they ran this
place like the navy
do you really think
they didnt know
its a big school robby
you know that
and were talking about
seven alleged victims
over what eight years
were talking about
seven that we know about
this is ridiculous
youre reaching for a story here
we cannot possibly
jack jack jack
if i had been president then
i wouldve known
bill im not sure
thats relevant
why do you think they sent
talbot up to cheverus
you know they
wanted him out of town
robby as well
intentioned as bills remarks are
im hoping we can
keep this between us
until we all get
on the same page
is that why were here
to get on the same page
no were here because youre
an important alumnus robby
and a friend
exactly and we know you care about
this school as much as we do
did you play
a sport here jack
yeah football why
mmm i ran track
you know i went to
providence yesterday
to talk to one of
father talbots victims
he played hockey here
and uh hes one
of the better ones
hes got a wife
kids good job
about 10 minutes
into the conversation
the guy breaks down
you know
couldnt stop crying
said he could never figure out
why father talbot picked him
father talbot
coached the hockey team
so
i guess we just got lucky
you and me
does jack dunn
work for the school
no hes pr
for boston college
they call him
when they need help
and pete conley
why was he there
good question
petes a big alum
but i called bill directly
and i asked
for a sitdown
i never mentioned
anybody else
its like everybody
already knows the story
yeah
except us
and we work right there
judge volterra
yes
hi im mike rezendes
from the boston globe
um im having
some trouble
accessing some
public records
down in the
records room
i was wondering if i could
have a word with you
all right
thank you
thank you very much
these exhibits youre after
mr rezendes
theyre very
sensitive records
with all due respect
your honor
thats not the question
the records are public
maybe so but tell me
wheres the editorial
responsibility
in publishing
records of this nature
well wheres the editorial
responsibility in not publishing them
you cant take those
you need to make copies
im going to the copy room
it closed at 400
look ill give you
83 bucks to use yours
hey cabbie
hey hey hey
take me to the boston globe
on morrissey boulevard
dont take 93
take dorchester avenue
robby its incredible
law knew about geoghan for years
no question
theres a letter to law
from a woman margaret gallant
who lived in jamaica plain in the
early 80s when geoghan was there
listen to this
our family is
rooted in the church
our desire is to
protect the holy orders
even in the midst
of our agony
over the seven boys
in our family
who have been violated
seven robby seven boys
it was suggested
we keep silent
we did not question the authority
of the church two years ago
but since father geoghan
is still in his parish
but she sent it to law
and law did shit
heres another one to law same year
listen to this
a word on the recent
assignment of father geoghan
as an associate
at st julias in weston
father geoghan has a history of
homosexual involvement with young boys
i understand his recent
departure from st brendans
may be related
to this problem
i wonder if father geoghan should
not be reduced to just weekend work
while receiving
some kind of therapy
you know how grateful i am to
you for your constant concern
sincerely yours in our lord
most reverend john m darcy
auxiliary bishop of boston
december 7 1984
an auxiliary bishop
wrote that
thats incredible
he broke ranks
i mean
when did gallant write her letter
and law just ignored it
how do you ignore
that freakin letter
we got em
you cant read these letters and
think anything else its proof
yeah it is
this is good work
should we
take it up to ben
uh
no not yet
why not
we got law this is it
no this is law
covering for one priest
theres another
90 out there
yeah and well print
that story when we get it
but we gotta go with this now
no im not going to
rush this story mike
we dont have
a choice robby
if we dont rush to print
somebody else is gonna find these
letters and butcher the story
joe quimby from the herald
was at the
freakin courthouse
so well write
a holding story
and well keep our
eye on the herald
keep our eye on the herald
they run this and they get it wrong
the church will bury it
we gotta do this now
mike mike
what why are we hesitating
baron told us to get law
this is law
baron told us to
get the system
we need the full scope
thats the only thing
that will put an end to this
then lets take it up
to ben let him decide
well take it to ben
when i say its time
its time robby its time
they knew and they
let it happen to kids
okay it couldve been you
it couldve been me
it could have been any of us
we gotta nail these scumbags
we gotta show people that
nobody can get away with this
not a priest or a cardinal
or a freaking pope
you finished
yeah i am this is bullshit
oh
you okay
mmm
hey hansi
hard day at work mike
here
thank you
i dont know why
i got so pissed off
you know i think
robbys wrong
you know youre just
you care about the story mike
we all do
yeah i guess
mmm
i stopped going to
church with my nana
it was
it was too hard
you know
id be sitting there
and id start thinking
about joe crowley
or someone else and i just
i just got so angry
did you tell her why
she goes to church
three times a week mike
it really pisses me off
you know
i actually really liked going to
church when i was a little kid
mmm
whyd you stop
typical shit
but the weird thing is
i think i
i think i figured that maybe one day
i would actually go back
i was really
i was holding on to that
mmm
i read those letters and
and something just cracked
its a shitty feeling
yeah
its a shitty feeling
looks like a long day
hey pete
im sorry to make it longer
brian
has anyone ever said no
to a drink with you pete
well sure
but the trick is to keep asking
for boston
boston
mmm
so you here
for the cardinal
oh no no no no
i wouldnt
i wouldnt presume to speak
for the cardinal no
you know
you got a lot of people here
who respect you robby
the work you do
thats good to know
you know its because you
care about this place
its why you do what you do
its who you are
you know
but people need the church
more than ever right now
you know you can feel it
and the cardinal
you know the cardinal
he might not be perfect
but we cant
throw out all the good
hes doing over
a few bad apples
now you know
im bringing this up to you
because i know this is
barons idea his agenda
i gotta tell ya
i mean honest to god
i mean he doesnt care about
this city the way we do
i mean how could he
this is how it happens isnt it pete
whats that
a guy leans on a guy
and suddenly
the whole town
just looks
the other way
robby robby look it
marty baron is just
trying to make his mark
hes gonna be here for a couple
of years and hes gonna move on
just like he did in
new york and miami
wherere you gonna go
hmm
good night robby
brian
hey pete
yeah
uh
when we do run the story uh im gonna
need a comment from the cardinal
well talk again later
good night robby
good night pete
robby
what
no shit when
okay yeah
hey
whats up
sweeney ruled
in our favor
she ruled to unseal
the documents
jeez
the church has already
filed an appeal
but the trial court ruling is
generally upheld in these matters
and when would we
get the documents
probably takes cohen
a few weeks to rule
then theres
a redaction process
uh id say theyd be
made public midjanuary
okay
all right
thanks jon
you bet
nice work
thanks
metro should run
something marty
we cant run
this one big
why wouldnt we
its a major first amendment victory
not to mention
you get
an irish catholic judge
ruling against the church
thats a hell of a precedent
mmmhmm
we dont want the herald
going deep on this
whys that
youre gonna have
to step out peter
im not stepping out
peter
when did you uh
a couple of weeks ago
a couple of weeks
yeah
and youre telling us now
these are substantial
they clearly show
that law was negligent
i need more time
i wanna keep digging
for what
this is the goddamn story
its not
the whole story
tough shit
were on a clock now
even if we dont
run sweeneys ruling
another paper could find these
letters and fuck the story
agreed
but we run
these letters alone
law apologizes
says its a onetime thing
he can bury it
how these clearly show he
knew and did nothing about it
look im close to
stories on 70 priests
we nail that
along with those letters
this is proof
this is bigger than law
its the whole system
you have multiple sources
confirming all those priests
on some i can get more
too risky if were not buttoned
up on every single one of them
the church will pick us apart
i think i can get us someone
from the other
side of the aisle
somebody inside the church
yeah a lawyer
will he go on the record
deep background
but hes a solid source
rezendes needs time
to write the story
we dont wanna drop it at
christmas not after 911
we could run it
just after new years
before they release
the rest of the documents
all right
tell canellos to bury
the ruling in metro
you got six weeks
thank you
tell mike i want
a draft by christmas
and we need a response
from lake street
who does pr for the cardinal
still john walsh
no somebody new
donna morrisey
she came from tv
shes young
good get a quote
we need something from law
to appear evenhanded
robby next time give
me a goddamn headsup
will do
silent night holy night
all is calm
all is bright
round yon virgin
mother and child
holy infant
so tender and mild
sleep in heavenly peace
sleep in heavenly peace

but thats my job robby
i was doing my job
yeah
you and everyone else
get out of my house

with a quote
from law hours ago
thats what i thought
when did you talk to her
okay okay larry
yeah yeah thats
good to know
thanks pete
anything
conley said donna morrisey should have
called he just left lake street
yeah rasky said
the same thing
this is ridiculous youd think
theyd wanna get ahead of this
i mean theyd be
idiots not to
i would love to see their faces
when they read this thing then
you know sundays the
feast of the epiphany
it seems appropriate
mike rezendes
hey donna
thanks for calling
yeah i just had a few questions
if you have a minute
what
what
another adjective
anything
law just turned us down
jesus christ
i just got off the phone
with donna morrisey
she said quote
we dont even want to know
what the questions are
end quote
she really said that
yeah
well that oughta do it
the church
had no interest
in knowing what the globes
questions would be
work it in somewhere before the jump
anything else
uh matt wants to put
the letters online
so the readers can
see for themselves
we can run the url at the
bottom of the article
its pretty straightforward
okay
we also put the spotlight tip
line at the end of the story
so people can call in
goes directly to our office
matt and i can go in in the
morning in case we get any calls
yeah im more concerned about
the phones at reception
after we ran
the porter case
the message centers
were tied up for weeks
its a real problem
there were picketers too
lots of em
ill talk to richard about
the security and the phones
uh how are we coming
on the folo story
well weve nailed
down multiple stories
on 70 priests
all 70
mmmhmm
and with the confirmation from
robbys source were ready to go
we can have
a draft next week
uh robby that
source of yours
is it something
we could revisit
he might be tough
but he has no problem
helping the church
protect dozens
of dirty priests
guys a scumbag
hes a lawyer hes doing his job
hes a shill
for the church
he knew
and did nothing
he couldve said something years ago
maybe saved some lives
what about us
whats that
supposed to mean
we had all the pieces
why didnt we get it sooner
we didnt have
all the pieces
we had saviano
we had barrett we had geoghan
we had the directories
in the basement
you know what
we got it now
robby the story
needed spotlight
mike spotlights
been around since 1970
so what we couldnt see the scope of this
no one could
robby this started
with one goddamn priest
macleish sent us a letter
on 20 priests years ago
sacha found the clip
you freaking kidding me
20 priests
when
uh just after porter
december 93
we buried the story
in metro no folo
that was you
you were metro
yeah that was me
id just taken over
i dont remember it at all
but yeah
um
can i say something here
sometimes its
easy to forget
that we spend most of our time
stumbling around in the dark
suddenly a light
gets turned on
and theres a fair share
of blame to go around
i cant speak to what
happened before i arrived
but um all of you have done
some very good reporting here
reporting that i believe
is gonna have an immediate
and considerable
impact on our readers
for me this kind of story
is why we do this
having said that cardinal law
and the catholic community
are gonna have a very
strong response to this
so if you need a moment
youve earned it
but i will need you
back here monday morning
focused and ready
to do your job
leaving
yeah
i uh just got a call
from the cardinal
really why
he wanted to
tell me personally
that he decided
not to comment
yeah said he wanted to
extend me that courtesy
jesus the balls on that guy
what did you say
i told him he was
making a mistake
and that we were
gonna run the story
damn right were
gonna run it
sacha can i have
