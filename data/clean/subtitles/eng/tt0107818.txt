i couldn t tell what i felt  
  i was unrecognizable
to myself  
  saw my reflection
in a window  
  and didn t know
my own face  
  oh  brother
are you gonna leave me  
  wastin  away
on the streets of philadelphia   
  i walked the avenue
till my legs felt like stone  
  i heard the voices of friends
vanished and gone  
  at night i could hear
the blood in my veins  
  just as black and whispering
as the rain  
  on the streets of philadelphia  
  ain t no angel gonna greet me  
  it s just you and i  my friend  
  and my clothes don t fit me no more  
  i walked a thousand miles
just to slip this skin  
  night has fallen
i m lyin  awake  
  i can feel myself
fadin  away  
  so receive me  brother
with your faithless kiss  
  or will we leave each other
alone like this   
  on the streets of philadelphia   
this  pestilent dust  that counselor refers to
has appeared on only three occasions 
each time it was tested 
and the results  limestone 
it s messy 
but innocuous 
innocuous 
defined by webster s as  harmless  
i know what it means 
may i  thank you 
your honor   
imagine how the children in this
neighborhood are being made to feel 
the constant pounding of construction
ringing in their ears 
as this skyscraper 
a tribute to mankind s greed 
grows daily 
casting an ominous shadow over their lives 
filling them with dread even as
they are surrounded by this toxic dust 
your honor  kendall construction
builds neighborhoods 
it doesn t destroy them 
granting a restraining order
against this construction site
will throw 753 philadelphians out of work 
and lend validation to this contemptible
and groundless nuisance suit 
it s an example of
the rapacious litigation
that today is tearing at
the very fabric of our society 
let s not go off the deep end  gentlemen 
you ve made an articulate and
compelling presentation  mr  miller 
but i don t believe
you ve proven irreparable harm 
not yet  your honor 
  is that you 
  yeah  that s me

oh  no  no  you re not 
charles 
andy has expressed a keen interest
in highline inc  versus sander systems 
isn t that right  andy 
the fate of the participants interests me 
yes  sir 
it s an antitrust action 
it is   
and it isn t  charles 
sander systems copies
highline s spreadsheet program 
for me 
the legal principle involved
is copyright infringement 
mmm 
well  tell me this  andy 
which side of this conflict
would you wish to see emerge victorious 
and don t allow my close 
personal relationship
with bill wright  sander systems  ceo 
to influence your answer in any way 
i d like to see highline win this one 
oh  why  beckett 
if sander systems wins 
an energetic  young company is destroyed 
the laws for antitrust and copyright
were enacted to prevent exactly
the kind of bullshit that
sander systems is trying to pull 
andy  you know who reps highline 
rodney bailey 
oh  i object 
rodney bailey 
who couldn t find his way
around copyright law with a map 
well  apparently 
the fellas at highline agree with you  andy 
which explains why 
as of 9 03 this evening 
right after the dessert course 
highline  incocrporated is now represented
by wyant  wheeler  hellerman 
tetlow   brown 
outstanding 
and more specifically 
senior associate andrew beckett

what can i do for you 
i ve been fired by wyant wheeler 
i plan on bringing a wrongful termination suit
against charles wheeler and his partners 
you want to sue wyant  wheeler 
hellerman  tetlow   brown 
correct  i m seeking representation 
continue 
i misplaced an important complaint 
that s their story 
want to hear mine 
how many lawyers you go to
before you called me 
nine 
continue 
the night before it was due 
i worked on the complaint in my office 
i left a copy of it on my desk 
the next day  the complaint vanished 
no hard copy 
all traces of it
mysteriously gone from my computer 
miraculously 
a copy of the complaint
was located at the last minute 
and we got it to court on time 
but the next day 
i was summoned to a meeting
with the managing partners 
they were waiting for me
in the conference room 
oh  hello  andy  come on in 
would you mind hitting the windows 
thanks  hey  come on in  come on in 
robert  charles  walter and lydia 
thanks for coming in 
oh  of course 
andy  before we begin 
i d just like to say
that everyone in this room is your friend 
i know that  charles 
more than your friend 
family 
charles  i must apologize again
for the highline mishap yesterday 
that was some scary moment around here 
wow  thank god the complaint was found 
and no damage was done 
this time 
what about next time 
there won t be a next time 
i guarantee it 
it s just that something s
come over you lately  andy 
i don t know 
some kind of stupor or fogginess 
some people think you have
an attitude problem  beckett 
really 
who thinks that 
i do 
excuse me 
am i being fired 
let me put it this way  andy 
your place in the future of this firm
is no longer secure 
we feel it isn t fair to keep you here
when your prospects are limited 
and now  i don t want to rush you out 
we ve got a committee meeting 
excuse me  charles 
with all due respect   
this is preposterous 
it doesn t make any sense 
oh  you re right  beckett 
you don t have an attitude problem 
take it easy  walter 
if you had lost confidence in me 
why did you give me the highline suit 
andy  you nearly blew the entire case 
for christ sake s 
that alone is inexcusable 
it would ve been catastrophic for us 
uh huh 
so you were concealing your illness 
that s correct 
all right  explain this to me
like i m a 2 year old  okay 
because there s an element to this thing
i just cannot get through my thick head 
didn t you have an obligation
to tell your employer
you had this dreaded 
deadly  infectious disease 
that s not the point 
from the day they hired me
to the day i was fired 
i served my clients consistently  thoroughly 
with absolute excellence 
if they hadn t fired me 
that s what i d be doing today 
and they don t want to fire you
for having aids 
so  in spite of your brilliance 
they make you look incompetent 
thus the mysterious lost files 
is that what you re trying to tell me 
correct  i was sabotaged 
i don t buy it  counselor 
that s very disappointing 
i don t see a case 
i have a case 
if you don t want it for personal reasons   
thank you  that s correct  i don t 
well  thank you for your time  counselor 
mr  beckett   
i m sorry about what happened to you 
it s a bitch  you know 
have a nice day  mr  beckett

namely  blood  semen

stanley  the guy who s putting in
our kitchen cabinets 
aunt teresa s gay 
that beautiful  sensuous 
voluptuous woman is a lesbian 
  duh 
  since when 
probably since she was born 
oh  man 
all right  well  hey  i admit it  okay 
i m prejudiced  i don t like homosexuals 
  there  you got me 
  all right 
i mean  the way these guys do that    thing 
don t they get confused 
 oh  i don t know  is that yours 
is that mine  huh  
you know  i don t want to be
in the bed with anybody
who s stronger than me 
or has more hair on their chest than i do 
now  you can call me old fashioned 
you can call me conservative 
just call me a man 
besides  i think you have
to be a man to understand how   
really disgusting that whole idea is anyway 
  yeah 
  yeah 
well  well 
  little caveman of the house 
  you damn skippy 
here you go  baby 
just stay away from your aunt teresa too 
do you hear me 
  joe  don t say that to her 
  think about it 
those guys pumping up together 
trying to be macho and faggot
at the same time 
i can t stand that shit 
hey  i m being totally honest with you  okay 
oh  yeah  you are 
all right  i ve got a question for you 
would you accept a client 
if you were constantly thinking 
 i don t want this person to touch me 
 i don t want him to even breathe on me  
not if i was you  honey 
that s what i m talking about 
  mm hm 
  what 
ho  ho  ho 
merry christmas 
  merry christmas 
  thank you 
ho  ho  ho 
hey  merry christmas 
merry christmas  sir 
ho  ho  ho 
  thanks   
  happy new year 
you re the   
     the tv guy 
  tv guy 
sir 
this is the supplement 
you re right 
there is a section on
hiv related discrimination 
oh  thank you 
thank you very much 
we do have a private
research room available 
i m fine right here  thank you 
excuse me  do you know where i can
find the state vs  murdock case 
  just a moment  i ll be right with you 
  okay  thanks 
wouldn t you be more comfortable
in a research room 
no 
would it make you more comfortable 
oh   
beckett  how you doing 
counselor 
huh 
whatever  sir 
excuse me 
who d you get 
what 
did you find a lawyer 
i m a lawyer 
hey  how s your baby 
oh  yeah  she s   
she s wonderful  great 
what s her name 
larice 
that s a beautiful name 
named her after my sister 
look  i m   
how d they find out you have the aids 
one of the partners noticed
a lesion on my forehead 
but how do you go from   
how do you go from a lawyer
spotting a lesion 
which could ve been anything 
to the partners deducing
that you have aids 
and terminating you
on the basis of that conclusion 
that s a good point 
the partner who spotted the lesion 
walter kenton 
worked for walsh  ulmer   brahm in d c 
a paralegal there  melissa benedict 
she showed lesions on and off
for the better part of two  three years 
she says it was common knowledge
around the office
that her lesions were caused by aids 
but they didn t fire her 
no 
they did not fire her 
  so  you got a relevant precedent 
  mm hmm 
  the arline decision 
  arline 
supreme court 
 the federal vocational
rehabilitation act
 of 1973 prohibits discrimination
 against otherwise qualified
handicapped persons 
 who are able to perform
 the duties required by their employment 
 although the ruling
 did not address the specific issue
of hiv and aids discrimination    
    subsequent decisions
have held that aids
 is protected as a handicap under law 
 not only because of
the physical limitations
 it imposes 
 but because the prejudice
surrounding aids
 exacts a social death which precedes   
    which precedes the actual physical one  
 this is the essence of discrimination 
 formulating opinions about others
 not based on their individual merits 
 but rather on their membership
 in a group with assumed characteristics  
charles wheeler 
julius erving

and now  discarding the trust and
affection i conferred upon him 
andrew beckett proposes
to haul me into court 
to sling accusations at me 
to call me a bigot 
in full view of the entire philadelphia
judicial establishment 
my god 
excuse me 
beckett doesn t want to go to court 
he s looking for a quick  tasty settlement 
a jury might decide that he has a case

i was a cute  little boy 
today is the 40th wedding anniversary
of my mom and dad  the becketts 
isn t that something 
pretty tough life around this poverty
so many years  huh 
well  now  those can be
some pretty mean streets 
don t let appearances fool you 
here s the front door 
now  i once slammed this finger
in the front door and i broke it 
  where s my brother 
  hey 
hey  there s my sister jill  everybody 
say hello  alexis 
mommy s pregnant again 
what 
  yes 
  are you really 
  hi  meghan

where s dad 
he s out trying to get
the snow blower fixed 
it snows once in seven years 
dad buys a new snow blower 
oh  how are you 
oh  mom  today s a good day 
meghan  keep that up 
you re doing a great job 
i got to say hello to the brontë sisters 
how are you  good to see you 
  hello 
  hi  andy 
  how are you 
  hi 
hey  hey  hey 
put me down 
  if you let me love you  
  it s for sure i m gonna love you  
  all the way  
  all  
  bud and sarah  
  all the way  
there s going to be things said at the trial
that are going to be hard for you to hear
about me and my personal life 
and there s going to be publicity 
i want to make sure
it s okay with everybody 
andy  you want me to take her 
no  no  she s   
she s fine 
i think it s great that you re asking  andy  but   
this is really your call 
all right  thank you  brother 
thank you 
hey  you re my kid brother 
that s all that matters  okay 
to be honest 
i m worried about mommy and daddy 
they ve been through so much already 
and it s possible that there are going
to be some very tough times ahead 
andy  the way   
the way that you ve handled
this whole thing 
you and miguel  with so much courage 
i don t believe there s anything
that anyone could say
that would make us feel anything
but incredibly proud of you 
well   
i didn t raise my kids
to sit in the back of the bus 
you get in there and you fight
for your rights  okay 
gee  i love you guys 
ladies and gentlemen of the jury   
forget everything you ve seen
on television and in the movies 
there s not going to be any
last minute surprise witnesses 
nobody s going to break down
on the stand with a tearful confession 
you re going to be presented
with a simple fact 
andrew beckett was fired 
you ll hear two explanations
for why he was fired 
ours and theirs 
it is up to you
to sift through layer upon layer of truth
until you determine for yourselves
which version sounds the most true 
there are certain points
that i must prove to you 
point number one 
andrew beckett was   
is   
a brilliant lawyer 
a great lawyer 
point number two 
andrew beckett 
afflicted with a debilitating disease 
made the understandable  the personal 
the legal choice
to keep the fact of his illness to himself 
point number three 
his employers discovered his illness 
and  ladies and gentlemen 
the illness i m referring to is aids 
point number four 
they panicked 
and in their panic  they did what
most of us would like to do with aids 
which is just get it and everybody who has it
as far away from the rest of us as possible 
now  the behavior
of andrew beckett s employers
may seem reasonable to you 
does to me 
after all  aids is a deadly 
incurable disease 
but no matter how you come to judge
charles wheeler and his partners
in ethical  moral  and in human terms 
the fact of the matter is 
when they fired andrew beckett 
because he had aids 
they broke the law 
fact 
andrew beckett s performance on the job
varied from competent  good 
to oftentimes mediocre 
to sometimes flagrantly incompetent 
fact 
he claims he s the victim of lies and deceit 
fact 
it was andrew beckett who lied 
going to great lengths to conceal
his disease from his employers 
fact 
he was
successful in his duplicity 
the partners at wyant wheeler
did not know
that andrew beckett had aids
when they fired him 
fact 
andrew beckett is dying 
fact 
andrew beckett is angry 
because his lifestyle 
his reckless behavior 
has cut short his life 
and in his anger  his rage 
he is lashing out 
and he wants someone to pay 
thank you 
andrew beckett represented
your company in a lawsuit in 1990 
  is that correct 
  that s correct 
were you pleased with his work 
we were satisfied with the outcome
of the litigation 
satisfied 
mr  laird 
when i approached you
about being a witness at this trial 
you gave sworn testimony in a deposition 
is that correct 
that s correct 
in that deposition  you said that you were   
 impressed and delighted
 with the quality of andrew beckett s work  
do you recall saying that 
in all honesty 
i was delighted
with certain aspects of andy s efforts 
but in general 
i found the work to be
merely satisfactory 
uh huh 
do you agree   
that a bologna sandwich
is a satisfactory meal 
whereas caviar and champagne 
roast duck and    baked alaska 
that might be considered a delightful meal 
we object 
these gastronomical comments are
irrelevant to these proceedings  your honor 
no  they are not irrelevant 
your honor  five months ago 
this witness characterized
andrew beckett as caviar 
now he s calling him
a bologna sandwich 
i think that the jury is entitled to know
what powerful force has caused him
to change his mind 
he hasn t changed his mind 
he s amplified his answer 
objection sustained 
all right 
all right  mr  laird  explain this to me
like i m a 4 year old  okay 
did andrew beckett win
your lawsuit for you 
yes  we won 
oh  congratulations 
that must ve been a very   
satisfactory experience 
homophobia s got to go 
hey  hey  ho  ho 
ready  mr  beckett 
get ready  here they come 
it s adam and eve 
not adam and steve 
thou shalt not lie with mankind 
do you see this as a gay rights issue 
i am not political 
i just want what is fair  what is right 
but you are gay  aren t you 
i don t see how that s any of your business 
but  yes  i am 
  totally irrelevant 
  it doesn t matter 
do you think that homosexuals
deserve special treatment 
hell  no 
we re standing here in philadelphia 
the city of brotherly love 
the birthplace of freedom 
where the founding fathers authored
the declaration of independence 
and i don t recall that glorious document
saying anything about
all straight men are created equal 
i believe it says 
 all men are created equal  
give me a goddamn break 
as far as someone being fired
from a law firm or a business 
if we found that their action
was discriminatory 
they could no longer do business
with the city 
thank you  mayor 
joe 
listen  you re   
you re not getting a little light
in the sneakers  are you  pal 
yeah  i am  filko 
i m   
i m changing 
i m on the prowl 
and i m looking for a hunk 
not just any hunk 
i mean a man  a real man like you 
come on  you can tell everybody about it 
you know what we do 
you want to play sailor 
you remember 
i m columbus  you re the first mate 
hey  knock if off  that s not funny 
let me tell you something 
these people make me sick  filko 
but a law s been broken 
you remember the law  don t you 
at least we agree on one thing  joe 
what s that  charlie 
tutti fruttis make me sick too 
ms  benedict  is it true that you
worked for walsh  ulmer   brahm
three years ago at the same time
as walter kenton 
that s correct 
and at that time  did walter kenton know
the ks lesions on your face and arms
were caused by aids 
definitely 
i told all the partners 
how did walter kenton treat you
after you told him you had aids 
every time he d come in contact with me 
he d get this look on his face 
i refer to it as the  oh  god  expression 
as in   oh  god  here comes
that woman with aids  
thank you  ms  benedict 
no more questions  your honor 
ms  benedict  how did you
contract the aids virus 
through a transfusion 
i lost a lot of blood
giving birth to my second child 
so  in other words  in your case 
there was no behavior on your part 
which caused you to be infected
with the virus 
it was something that you were unable
to avoid  isn t that correct 
i guess 
thank you 
but i don t consider myself any different
from anyone else with this disease 
i m not guilty  i m not innocent 
i m just trying to survive 
thank you  ms  benedict 
no further questions at this time 
your honor 
you may step down  mrs  benedict 
beyond noticing the marks on his face 
were there other things about
his appearance  miss burton 
that made you suspect
that andrew had aids 
well  he was getting thinner 
and he seemed very tired sometimes 
but he was working so hard 
still  i felt something was wrong 
and i can t believe that
they re trying to pretend
that they didn t notice anything 
objection 
just answer the question  please 
have you ever felt discriminated
against at wyant wheeler 
well  yes 
  in what way 
  well   
mr  wheeler s secretary  lydia 
said that mr  wheeler had
a problem with my earrings 
really 
apparently mr  wheeler felt they were
too  ethnic  is the word she used 
and she told me that
he said he would like it
if i wore something a little less garish 
a little smaller  and more   
 american  
what d you say 
i said   my earrings are american 
 they re african american  
let s have order  please 
thank you  no more questions 
miss burton 
weren t you recently promoted 
yes  i m in charge
of the paralegal department 
congratulations on your unfettered
ascendancy at wyant wheeler 
well  i don t know if i d go so far
as to call it unfettered 
i don t understand 
how do you explain
the promotion of an obviously
intelligent  articulate 
qualified african american woman
in a firm which practices discrimination
as wantonly and consistently
as you and mr  beckett claim 
i can t explain it 
could it be
that these   
instances of discrimination
are in fact misunderstandings
that have been blown
completely out of proportion 
i think counsel tends
to oversimplify the issue somewhat 
well  thank you  miss burton 
i ll    take that note under consideration 
  how s the trial going 
  excuse me 
it s a great case  i saw you on television 
i m a law student at penn 
  oh 
  how re you doing 
  i m all right  how are you 
  all right 
  saw me on tv 
  yeah 
it s a good school  penn  good school 
what year are you in 
  second 
  good 
listen  i just want to tell you 
this case  it s tremendously important 
and i just wanted to let you know
i think you re doing a fantastic job 
hey 
thank you 
look  when you graduate 
you give me a call 
  okay 
  all right 
  thank you 
  all right 
  thank you very much 
  take it easy 
  listen  joe   
  yeah 
would you like to have a drink with me 
i just finished a game
and i could use a beer  you know 
no  i can t  you know  my wife is   
i don t pick up people
in drugstores every day 
what  you think i m gay 
aren t you 
what is the matter with you 
do i look gay to you 
do i look gay to you 
  joe  relax 
  no  what do you mean  relax 
you know  i ought to kick
your faggoty little ass 
take it as a compliment  jeez 
you know  that is exactly
the kind of bullshit
that makes people hate your little   
faggoty ass 
you want to try and kick my ass  joe 
  asshole 
  no  you re the asshole  buddy 
please continue  miss o hara 
we were going crazy
looking for this complaint 
i felt like i was in the twilight zone 
mr  beckett was screaming at everybody
and he just    he looked so freaky 
and mr  kenton kept saying 
 you lost the highline complaint  
and he called mr  wheeler 
and all of a sudden 
jamey comes in
with the complaint in his hand 
he says   it was in central files  andy  
central files 
yes  central files is a place
where paperwork is sent
when cases are closed 
well  jamey ran it
over to the court just in time 
and everybody just stood there 
completely wasted 
and mr   
and mr  beckett just kept saying   
 i m sorry  sorry  i don t understand this  
thank you  miss o hara 
no further questions at this time 
your honor 
all right  mr  miller 
  may i 
  certainly 
thank you 
you okay 
yes 
you want a glass of water or something 
no 
was andy a good boss 
yes 
he was very sweet 
how would you characterize
his work as an attorney 
how would i know  i just worked for him 
excuse me  your honor 
but is this for the record 
mr  miller  perhaps you should
return to counsel s table 
yes  sir 
miss o hara 
yes 
were you aware 
at any time 
of any problems that
the senior partners had
with the quality of andrew s work
prior to this missing file episode 
no  no  i wasn t 
thank you 
no more questions  your honor 
is andrew beckett the kind of lawyer
who misplaces crucial documents 
not to my knowledge 
no 
mr  collins  if you wanted to
make a lawyer look incompetent 
would this be a good way of going about it 
hiding an important document
maybe for a few hours 
and then making it look like
the responsible lawyer misplaced it 
why would mr  wheeler and
the others behave so outrageously 
because they found out andy was sick 
  he s not answering the question 
  perhaps 
we have lawyers who ve had
heart attacks  ulcers 
prostate cancer  leukemia 
no one sandbagged them 
did you have something to do
with this file being lost
accidentally on purpose 
  objection 
  i ll rephrase 
did you have anything to do
with this file being misplaced 
absolutely not 
are you a homosexual 
what 
are you a homosexual 
answer the question  are you a homo 
are you a faggot  you know  a punk 
queen  pillow biter  fairy 
bootie snatcher  rump roaster 
are you gay  
  objection 
  order 
order 
where did this come from 
suddenly counsel s attacking
his own witness 
mr  collins  sexual orientation
has nothing to do with this case 
please have a seat  miss conine 
would you approach the bench  mr  miller 
could you kindly share with me
exactly what s going on inside your head 
because at this moment 
i don t have a clue 
your honor 
everybody in this courtroom
is thinking about   
sexual orientation 
you know  sexual preference 
whatever you want to call it 
who does what to whom
and how they do it 
i mean  they re looking at andrew beckett 
they re thinking about it 
they re looking at mr  wheeler 
miss conine  even you  your honor 
they re wondering about it 
trust me 
i know that they re looking at me
and thinking about it 
so let s just get it out in the open 
let s get it out of the closet 
because this case is not
just about aids  is it 
so let s talk about
what this case is really all about 
the general public s hatred  our loathing 
our fear of homosexuals 
and how that climate of hatred and fear
translated into the firing
of this particular homosexual 
my client  andrew beckett 
please have a seat  mr  miller 
very good 
in this courtroom  mr  miller  justice is blind
to matters of race  creed  color  religion 
and sexual orientation 
with all due respect  your honor   
we don t live in this courtroom 
though  do we 
no  we don t 
however  as regards to this witness 
i m going to sustain the defense s objection 
how many weeks at a time
would you be out to sea
without stopping at port 
anywhere from two weeks
to several months 
any women on board 
not when i was in the navy 
so  during these long voyages 
months at a time out to sea 
no women in sight 
hundreds of hardworking 
robust young men
in the prime of their lives 
at the peak of their natural
appetites and desires 
their god given hormonal instincts 
anything going on 
going on  like what 
like two sailors down below
making flippy flop 
objection 
mr  miller 
we had one guy like that 
you haven t ruled on my objection 
your honor 
go on  mr  miller 
you had one guy  like that  
you mean a homosexual 
he strutted around quarters naked 
trying to get everybody to notice him 
made everyone sick 
he was destroying our morale 
so we let him know this kind
of behavior was not acceptable 
how d you do that 
what d you do  wrote him a letter 
we stuck his head in a latrine
after ten of us had used it 
you taught him a lesson  didn t you 
yes  we did 
just like firing andrew beckett
taught him a lesson 
  objection 
  i withdraw 
you were aware when you worked
with melissa benedict
that she had aids  is that correct 
she didn t try to conceal it 
so you are aware of the difference
between a bruise and a lesion 
is that correct 
beckett told me he had been hit
by a racquetball  and i believed him 
didn t you try to avoid contact
with mrs  benedict
after you found out she had aids 
she says  and i quote  that you   
 were repulsed by her  you avoided her  
is that correct 
i felt  and i still feel nothing
but the deepest sympathy
and compassion for people like melissa
who contracted this terrible disease
through no fault of their own 
okay  don t move  now 
okay 
boy  it s not going through 
we may have to flush it out again 
the vein s closed 
we ve got to call barbara 
nurse ratchett 
wait a minute 
yeah  tell her to come over 
look  i ve   
there s so much stuff
that i need to get done 
can we    can we just skip
the treatment for tonight 
no  no  we are not skipping this treatment 
it s my arm  and it s my treatment 
and i say skip it 
well   
you know something 
hmm 
that stuff is saving your life 
what s the matter with you tonight

is look at me 
and give me a little of your time  man

now  aren t you 
no  no 
well  i ll tell you what i m going to do

my memorial service 
i m going to start preparing
for the inevitable 
maybe you should think about it

congratulations  counselor 
congratulations 
you ve survived what i assume
to be your first gay party intact 
let me tell you something  andrew 
when you re brought up the way i am 
the way most people are in this country 
there s not a whole lot of discussion
about homosexuality 
or  what do you call it  alternate lifestyles 
as a kid you re taught
that queers are funny 
queers are weird 
queers dress up like their mother 
that they re afraid to fight 
that they re a danger to little kids 
and that all they want to do
is to get into your pants 
and that pretty much sums up
the general thinking out there 
if you want to know the truth about it 
thank you for sharing that with me 
very well  all right  let s go over this testimony 
we ve got a big day on monday 
okay  first i ll ask you   
 can you describe the circumstances 
in which you joined the firm
 wyant  wheeler  hellerman 
tetlow   brown  
miller   
do you ever pray 
andrew  that is not the answer
to the question 
but  yes  i pray 
what do you pray for 
what do you mean  i pray 
i pray that    i don t know 
i pray that my baby is healthy 
i pray that my wife made it
through the delivery 
i pray that the phillies win the pennant 
now  can we go through these questions 
number one 
 can you describe the circumstances 
 in which you joined the firm
 wyant  wheeler  hellerman 
tetlow   brown  
can you do that for me 
there s a possibility i won t be around
to see the end of this trial 
yes  i ve considered that 
i ve made some provisions
in my will for some charities 
miguel will need a lawyer 
i know it s not your area 
i know a good probate lawyer 
thank you 
you re welcome 
now  can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined the firm
wyant  wheeler  hellerman 
tetlow   brown 
do you mind this music 
do you like opera 
i am not that familiar with opera  andrew 
this is my favorite aria 
it s maria callas 
it s andrea chenier 
umberto giordano 
this is madeleine 
she s saying how   
during the french revolution 
the mob set fire to her house 
and her mother died    saving her 
she says   look 
 the place that cradled me is burning 
 i m alone  
do you hear the heartache in her voice 
can you feel it  joe 
now  in come the strings 
and it changes everything 
the music  it fills with a hope 
now  it ll change again  listen 
listen 
 i bring sorrow to those who love me  
oh  that single cello 
 it was during this sorrow
that love came to me  
 a voice filled with harmony  
 it said  live still  
 i am life  
 heaven is in your eyes  
 is everything around you
just the blood and the mud 
 i am divine 
 i am oblivion 
 i am the god
 that comes down
from the heavens to the earth
 and makes of the earth a heaven  
 i am love 
 i am love  
well   
hey   
geez  i d better get out of here 
lisa s

no  you re ready  you re ready 
jesus

oh  i love you  little larice 
place your left hand on the bible 
raise your right hand 
do you swear to tell the whole truth 
and nothing but the truth 
so help you god 
i do 
please be seated 
andrew 
can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined the firm
wyant  wheeler  hellerman 
tetlow   brown 
wyant wheeler
aggressively recruited me 
they were the most
prestigious firm in philadelphia 
full of opportunity 
and i was impressed with the partners 
including charles wheeler 
particularly charles 
what impressed you about him 
he was the kind of lawyer
i thought i wanted to be 
and what kind of lawyer is that 
possessed of an encyclopedic
knowledge of the law 
a razor sharp litigator  genuine leader 
gifted at bringing out
the very best in others 
an awesome ability to illuminate
the most complex of legal concepts
to a colleague  to a courtroom 
to the man in the street 
the kind of person who can
play three sets of tennis 
but doesn t sweat 
underneath an elegant surface 
he has an adventurous spirit 
so  in the years you worked
at wyant wheeler 
did you ever tell charles wheeler
you were gay 
no  i didn t 
why not 
you don t bring your personal life
into a law firm 
you re not supposed to have
a personal life  really 
anyway  i did plan to tell charles eventually 
but then this    something happened
at the racquet club
about three and ha    three years ago 
somebody started telling some jokes 
what do you call a woman
who has pms and esp
at the same time 
i don t know  roger 
what do you call her 
a bitch who knows everything 
sounds like someone i know 
hey  walter  how does
a faggot fake an orgasm 
he throws a quart of hot yogurt
on your back 
that reminds me of the hairdresser   
how d that make you feel 
relieved 
that i never told him i was gay 
just very relieved 
all right 
are you a good lawyer  andrew 
i m an excellent lawyer 
what makes you an excellent lawyer 
i love the law 
i know the law 
i excel at practicing 
what do you love about the law  andrew 
i    many things 
what i love the most about the law 
yes 
is that every now and again 
not often  but occasionally 
you get to be a part of
justice being done 
that really is
quite a thrill when that happens 
thank you  andrew 
you said earlier you   
aspire to be the kind of person
who had an adventurous spirit 
is that correct 
something like that 
do you take risks 
in my work  yes  calculated risks 
you have to 
did your doctor ever tell you
to reduce stress 
that    long hours
and stressful working conditions
might damage the immune system
and speed up your illness 
my doctor mentioned the impact aids   
excuse me 
my doctor mentioned the impact stress
could have on the immune system 
have you ever been to the
stallion showcase cinema
on 21st street 
i ve been to    that   
i ve been to that theater   
three times in my life 
what kind of movies do they show there 
gay movies 
gay pornographic movies 
yes 
objection  your honor 
your honor  this line of questioning
is vital to the issue of credibility 
let s   
let s see where this is going

do men have sex with each other
in that theater 
some men 
have you ever had sex
with anyone in that theater 
i m robert 
andy 
yes 
once 
when 
approximately what year
did that event take place 
i guess it was   
1984 
 84   85 
were you aware in 1984   85
that there was a fatal disease
out there called aids 
and that you could contract it
through sexual activity 
i d heard of some   
i d heard of a thing   
the gay plague  the gay cancer 
we didn t know how you could get it 
or that it killed you 
do you need a break  mr  beckett 
no 
no  i could use some water  though 
john  could you bring mr  beckett
some water please 
while you were employed at wyant wheeler 
you did everything you could
to make sure no one knew that
you were an active homosexual 
is that correct 
no 
that s not correct  i never lied about it 
as a homosexual 
one is often forced
to conceal one s sexuality 
isn t that right 
in some circumstances  yes 
isn t it true that you ve spent your life
pretending to be something you re not 
so much so that the art
of concealment and dishonesty   
     has become second nature  
  your honor  i object 
i ll withdraw it  your honor 
mr  beckett  were you living with   
miguel alvarez
in 1984 or  85
when you had your   
anonymous sexual encounter
in the porn theater 
yes 
so  you could have infected him 
isn t that right 
miguel has not been infected 
you didn t answer my question 
you could have infected
mr  alvarez at that time 
is that correct 
yes 
you ve testified that
the lesions on your face
were visible to the people
that you worked with  correct 
that s right 
and it s your contention
that when the partners
were made aware of the lesions 
that they leapt to the conclusion
that you had aids and they fired you 
is that correct 
as painful as it is
to accuse my former colleagues
of such reprehensible behavior 
it is the only conclusion i could come to 
do you have any lesions
on your face at this time 
one 
here  right by my ear 
your honor  may i approach the witness 
yes  you may 
remembering that you re under oath 
answering truthfully 
can you see the lesions
on your face in this mirror
from three feet away 
answering truthfully 
well  at the time i was fired 
i had four lesions 
and they were much bigger 
could you answer the question  please 
well  no  no  i can t really see it 
no 
no more questions  your honor 
i think this would be a good time
to break for today 
we can reconvene in the morning 
i hate this case 
your honor  may i have
five minutes in redirect 
mr  beckett  can you
go on for five minutes 
three minutes 
yes  yes 
may i borrow your mirror  please 
andrew   
do you have any lesions
on any part of your body
at this time that resemble
the lesions you had on your face
at the time that you were fired 
yes 
on my torso 
your torso  if it please the court 
i would like to ask andrew
to remove his shirt 
so that  you know  everyone here
could get an accurate idea
of what we re talking about 
objection 
your honor  it would
unfairly influence the jury 
your honor  if andrew was forced
to use a wheelchair due to his illness 
would the defense ask him to park it outside 
because it would unfairly influence the jury 
come on  we re talking about aids 
we re talking about lesions 
let s see what we re talking about 
i ll allow it 
mr  beckett  would you please
remove your shirt 
my god  what a nightmare 
he asked for it 
andrew 
can you see the lesions
on your chest in this mirror 
yes 
thank you 
do you swear to tell the whole truth 
and nothing but the truth  so help you god 
i do 
please be seated 
mr  wheeler 
were you aware that andrew beckett
was suffering from aids
at the time of his departure
from wyant wheeler 
no 
for absolute clarity 
did you fire andrew beckett 
because he had aids 
no  i did not fire andrew beckett 
because he had aids 
mr  wheeler  can you explain
in a way that leaves no doubt
why you promoted
andrew beckett through your firm 
and then  most importantly 
why you eventually asked him to leave 
if you re the owner
of a major league ball club 
you recruit the hot rookie 
and andy was tremendously
promising as a young attorney 
fresh out of penn  crackerjack 
that s why we went after him 
that s why we hired him 
and that s why we stuck with him
year after year 
why did you give him
opportunity after opportunity 
well  when you groom someone
the way we groomed andy  nurturing him 
lavishing all kinds
of special treatment on him 
you make quite an investment 
we were waiting for the promise
to kick in and deliver 
but ultimately we could
no longer ignore the gap
between the reality and the promise 
thank you  mr  wheeler 
no more questions at this time 
your honor 
mr  miller 
objection 
your honor  objection 
all right  mr  miller  that ll be sufficient 
mr  wheeler  you are magnificent 
you are    you are my hero 
andrew is right  you are the greatest 
are you gay 
objection 
how dare you 
witness will kindly answer 
no  i am not a homosexual 
isn t it true that when you realized
andrew beckett  your golden boy 
your future senior partner 
was gay and had aids 
it drove a stake of fear
right through your heterosexual heart 
remembering all the hugs
and the handshakes 
the intimate moments in the sauna 
the friendly pats on the backside
that you and andrew exchanged
like i ve exchanged sometimes 
it made you say   
 my god  what does this say about me  
objection  your honor 
the witness will please
respond to the question 
mr  miller  you may tap dance
around me all you wish
with your innuendoes
and locker room fantasies 
but the truth still remains
that your client worked
when he wanted to work 
telling us what he thought
we needed to know
about who he really was 
andy insisted on bending the rules 
and his work suffered
tremendously in the long run
as a result of that 
well  you explain this to me
like i m a six year old  mr  wheeler 
 cause i just don t get it 
who makes these rules
that you re talking about  huh 
you 
read your bible  mr  miller 
old and the new testament 
pretty valuable rules in there 
excuse me 
andrew 
excuse me  i can t   
andy 
excuse me  andy 
for chrissakes  somebody get a doctor 
turn over now 
call an ambulance  please 
  right away 
  joe  joe  joe 
  an ambulance  please 
  just get an ambulance 
let him breathe  let him breathe 
please make room for him 
it s not working 
no  it is making it worse 
did you notice any changes whatsoever
in andrew s appearance
over the course of the year
leading up to his termination 
yes  i did 
were these changes for the better
or for the worse 
sometimes for the better 
but generally  they were for the worse 
mr  seidman  what did you
think caused these changes
in andy s appearance 
i was afraid 
i suspected andy had aids 
order  order 
thank you  your witness 
miss conine 
mr  seidman 
did you share your suspicions
with mr  wheeler
or any of the other managing partners
at any time before the decision
to fire andrew beckett was made 
no  no  i didn t 
i didn t mention it to anyone  not even andy 
i didn t even give him
a chance to talk about it 
and i think i m going to regret that
for as long as i live 
any more questions  miss conine 
that s all  your honor 
now  they are saying
that he wasn t a good lawyer 
he was mediocre 
and the fact that they gave him
the most important lawsuit
that they ever had
for one of their most important clients 
now  they say that
that doesn t prove anything 
because that was just a test 
what d they call it  a carrot 
yeah  what s up  doc 
to see if he would rise to the occasion 
okay  okay  so   
say i ve got to send a pilot
into enemy territory 
and he s gonna be flying a plane
that costs  350 million 
who am i gonna put in that plane 
some rookie who can t cut the grade 
because i wanna see
if he can rise to the challenge 
or am i gonna give that assignment
to my best pilot 
my sharpest  my most
experienced  my top gun 
the very best i ve got 
i just don t get that 
would somebody please explain it to me   
like i m a six year old

we award  100 000 
and for punitive damages 
we award  4 782 000
