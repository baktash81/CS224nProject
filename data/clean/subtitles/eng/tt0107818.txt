i couldnt tell what i felt
i was unrecognizable
to myself
saw my reflection
in a window
and didnt know
my own face
oh brother
are you gonna leave me
wastin away
on the streets of philadelphia
i walked the avenue
till my legs felt like stone
i heard the voices of friends
vanished and gone
at night i could hear
the blood in my veins
just as black and whispering
as the rain
on the streets of philadelphia
aint no angel gonna greet me
its just you and i my friend
and my clothes dont fit me no more
i walked a thousand miles
just to slip this skin
night has fallen
im lyin awake
i can feel myself
fadin away
so receive me brother
with your faithless kiss
or will we leave each other
alone like this
on the streets of philadelphia
this pestilent dust that counselor refers to
has appeared on only three occasions
each time it was tested
and the results limestone
its messy
but innocuous
innocuous
defined by websters as harmless
i know what it means
may i thank you
your honor
imagine how the children in this
neighborhood are being made to feel
the constant pounding of construction
ringing in their ears
as this skyscraper
a tribute to mankinds greed
grows daily
casting an ominous shadow over their lives
filling them with dread even as
they are surrounded by this toxic dust
your honor kendall construction
builds neighborhoods
it doesnt destroy them
granting a restraining order
against this construction site
will throw 753 philadelphians out of work
and lend validation to this contemptible
and groundless nuisance suit
its an example of
the rapacious litigation
that today is tearing at
the very fabric of our society
lets not go off the deep end gentlemen
youve made an articulate and
compelling presentation mr miller
but i dont believe
youve proven irreparable harm
not yet your honor
is that you
yeah thats me
miller yes

andy
yo
am i interrupting you
in a word bob
charles wants to see you upstairs
i was just about to take a break
youre sure im not underdressed for this
oh no no youre not
charles
andy has expressed a keen interest
in highline inc versus sander systems
isnt that right andy
the fate of the participants interests me
yes sir
its an antitrust action
it is
and it isnt charles
sander systems copies
highlines spreadsheet program
for me
the legal principle involved
is copyright infringement
mmm
well tell me this andy
which side of this conflict
would you wish to see emerge victorious
and dont allow my close
personal relationship
with bill wright sander systems ceo
to influence your answer in any way
id like to see highline win this one
oh why beckett
if sander systems wins
an energetic young company is destroyed
the laws for antitrust and copyright
were enacted to prevent exactly
the kind of bullshit that
sander systems is trying to pull
andy you know who reps highline
rodney bailey
oh i object
rodney bailey
who couldnt find his way
around copyright law with a map
well apparently
the fellas at highline agree with you andy
which explains why
as of 903 this evening
right after the dessert course
highline incocrporated is now represented
by wyant wheeler hellerman
tetlow  brown
outstanding
and more specifically
senior associate andrew beckett

against charles wheeler and his partners
you want to sue wyant wheeler
hellerman tetlow  brown
correct im seeking representation
continue
i misplaced an important complaint
thats their story
want to hear mine
how many lawyers you go to
before you called me
nine
continue
the night before it was due
i worked on the complaint in my office
i left a copy of it on my desk
the next day the complaint vanished
no hard copy
all traces of it
mysteriously gone from my computer
miraculously
a copy of the complaint
was located at the last minute
and we got it to court on time
but the next day
i was summoned to a meeting
with the managing partners
they were waiting for me
in the conference room
oh hello andy come on in
would you mind hitting the windows
thanks hey come on in come on in
robert charles walter and lydia
thanks for coming in
oh of course
andy before we begin
id just like to say
that everyone in this room is your friend
i know that charles
more than your friend
family
charles i must apologize again
for the highline mishap yesterday
that was some scary moment around here
wow thank god the complaint was found
and no damage was done
this time
what about next time
there wont be a next time
i guarantee it
its just that somethings
come over you lately andy
i dont know
some kind of stupor or fogginess
some people think you have
an attitude problem beckett
really
who thinks that
i do
excuse me
am i being fired
let me put it this way andy
your place in the future of this firm
is no longer secure
we feel it isnt fair to keep you here
when your prospects are limited
and now i dont want to rush you out
weve got a committee meeting
excuse me charles
with all due respect
this is preposterous
it doesnt make any sense
oh youre right beckett
you dont have an attitude problem
take it easy walter
if you had lost confidence in me
why did you give me the highline suit
andy you nearly blew the entire case
for christ sakes
that alone is inexcusable
it wouldve been catastrophic for us
uhhuh
so you were concealing your illness
thats correct
all right explain this to me
like im a 2yearold okay
because theres an element to this thing
i just cannot get through my thick head
didnt you have an obligation
to tell your employer
you had this dreaded
deadly infectious disease
thats not the point
from the day they hired me
to the day i was fired
i served my clients consistently thoroughly
with absolute excellence
if they hadnt fired me
thats what id be doing today
and they dont want to fire you
for having aids
so in spite of your brilliance
they make you look incompetent
thus the mysterious lost files
is that what youre trying to tell me
correct i was sabotaged
i dont buy it counselor
thats very disappointing
i dont see a case
i have a case
if you dont want it for personal reasons
thank you thats correct i dont
well thank you for your time counselor
mr beckett
im sorry about what happened to you
its a bitch you know
have a nice day mr beckett

you know i dont want to be
in the bed with anybody
whos stronger than me

yeah
yeah
well well
little caveman of the house
you damn skippy
here you go baby

at the same time
i cant stand that shit
hey im being totally honest with you okay
oh yeah you are
all right ive got a question for you
would you accept a client
if you were constantly thinking
i dont want this person to touch me
i dont want him to even breathe on me
not if i was you honey
thats what im talking about
mmhm
what
ho ho ho
merry christmas
merry christmas
thank you
ho ho ho
hey merry christmas
merry christmas sir
ho ho ho
thanks
happy new year
youre the
the tv guy
tv guy
sir
this is the supplement
youre right
there is a section on
hiv related discrimination
oh thank you
thank you very much
we do have a private
research room available
im fine right here thank you
excuse me do you know where i can
find the state vs murdock case
just a moment ill be right with you
okay thanks
wouldnt you be more comfortable
in a research room
no
would it make you more comfortable
oh
beckett how you doing
counselor
huh
whatever sir
excuse me
whod you get
what
did you find a lawyer
im a lawyer
hey hows your baby
oh yeah shes
shes wonderful great
whats her name
larice
thats a beautiful name
named her after my sister
look im
howd they find out you have the aids
one of the partners noticed
a lesion on my forehead
but how do you go from
how do you go from a lawyer
spotting a lesion
which couldve been anything
to the partners deducing
that you have aids
and terminating you
on the basis of that conclusion
thats a good point
the partner who spotted the lesion
walter kenton
worked for walsh ulmer  brahm in dc
a paralegal there melissa benedict
she showed lesions on and off
for the better part of two three years
she says it was common knowledge
around the office
that her lesions were caused by aids
but they didnt fire her
no
they did not fire her
so you got a relevant precedent
mmhmm
the arline decision
arline
supreme court
the federal vocational
rehabilitation act
of 1973 prohibits discrimination
against otherwise qualified
handicapped persons
who are able to perform
the duties required by their employment
although the ruling
did not address the specific issue
of hiv and aids discrimination
subsequent decisions
have held that aids
is protected as a handicap under law
not only because of
the physical limitations
it imposes
but because the prejudice
surrounding aids
exacts a social death which precedes
which precedes the actual physical one
this is the essence of discrimination
formulating opinions about others
not based on their individual merits
but rather on their membership
in a group with assumed characteristics
charles wheeler
julius erving
by golly am i glad to see you
ken starr
ken how are you

pathetic bars on chestnut street
right charles

absolutely
charles
what deviant groups or organizations
does he secretly belong to
first thing in the morning
wait a minute
bob what is it
look
lets make a fair settlement offer
and put this whole tragic
business behind us
bob
andy brought aids into our offices
into our mens room
he brought aids
to our annual goddamn family picnic
we ought to be suing him bob
where is your compassion gentlemen
bob we gave him highline
did andrew beckett say
i might not be able to serve our client
to the best of my ability
he said nothing
and now discarding the trust and
affection i conferred upon him
andrew beckett proposes
to haul me into court
to sling accusations at me
to call me a bigot
in full view of the entire philadelphia
judicial establishment
my god
excuse me
beckett doesnt want to go to court
hes looking for a quick tasty settlement
a jury might decide that he has a case
wait a minute
he was fired for incompetence
not because he has aids
you didnt know he was sick did you bob
holy shit did you bob
no no not really
okay okay everybody
everybody this is the house that i grew up in
bonito palacito
right here in the hometown
of lower merion pennsylvania
very good
oh wait here
and heres proof
its there
my handprints from when
i was a cute little boy
today is the 40th wedding anniversary

all
bud and sarah

about me and my personal life
and theres going to be publicity
i want to make sure
its okay with everybody
andy you want me to take her
no no shes
shes fine
i think its great that youre asking andy but
this is really your call
all right thank you brother
thank you
hey youre my kid brother
thats all that matters okay
to be honest
im worried about mommy and daddy
theyve been through so much already
and its possible that there are going
to be some very tough times ahead
andy the way
the way that youve handled
this whole thing
you and miguel with so much courage
i dont believe theres anything
that anyone could say
that would make us feel anything
but incredibly proud of you
well
i didnt raise my kids
to sit in the back of the bus
you get in there and you fight
for your rights okay
gee i love you guys
ladies and gentlemen of the jury
forget everything youve seen
on television and in the movies
theres not going to be any
lastminute surprise witnesses
nobodys going to break down
on the stand with a tearful confession
youre going to be presented
with a simple fact
andrew beckett was fired
youll hear two explanations
for why he was fired
ours and theirs
it is up to you
to sift through layer upon layer of truth
until you determine for yourselves
which version sounds the most true
there are certain points
that i must prove to you
point number one
andrew beckett was
is
a brilliant lawyer
a great lawyer
point number two
andrew beckett
afflicted with a debilitating disease
made the understandable the personal
the legal choice
to keep the fact of his illness to himself
point number three
his employers discovered his illness
and ladies and gentlemen
the illness im referring to is aids
point number four
they panicked
and in their panic they did what
most of us would like to do with aids
which is just get it and everybody who has it
as far away from the rest of us as possible
now the behavior
of andrew becketts employers
may seem reasonable to you
does to me
after all aids is a deadly
incurable disease
but no matter how you come to judge
charles wheeler and his partners
in ethical moral and in human terms
the fact of the matter is
when they fired andrew beckett
because he had aids
they broke the law
fact
andrew becketts performance on the job
varied from competent good
to oftentimes mediocre
to sometimes flagrantly incompetent
fact
he claims hes the victim of lies and deceit
fact
it was andrew beckett who lied
going to great lengths to conceal
his disease from his employers
fact
he was
successful in his duplicity
the partners at wyantwheeler
did not know
that andrew beckett had aids
when they fired him
fact
andrew beckett is dying
fact
andrew beckett is angry
because his lifestyle
his reckless behavior
has cut short his life
and in his anger his rage
he is lashing out
and he wants someone to pay
thank you
andrew beckett represented
your company in a lawsuit in 1990
is that correct
thats correct
were you pleased with his work
we were satisfied with the outcome
of the litigation
satisfied
mr laird
when i approached you
about being a witness at this trial
you gave sworn testimony in a deposition
is that correct
thats correct
in that deposition you said that you were
impressed and delighted
with the quality of andrew becketts work
do you recall saying that
in all honesty
i was delighted
with certain aspects of andys efforts
but in general
i found the work to be
merely satisfactory
uhhuh
do you agree
that a bologna sandwich
is a satisfactory meal
whereas caviar and champagne
roast duck and baked alaska
that might be considered a delightful meal
we object
these gastronomical comments are
irrelevant to these proceedings your honor
no they are not irrelevant
your honor five months ago
this witness characterized
andrew beckett as caviar
now hes calling him
a bologna sandwich
i think that the jury is entitled to know
what powerful force has caused him
to change his mind
he hasnt changed his mind
hes amplified his answer
objection sustained
all right
all right mr laird explain this to me
like im a 4yearold okay
did andrew beckett win
your lawsuit for you
yes we won
oh congratulations
that mustve been a very
satisfactory experience
homophobias got to go
hey hey ho ho
ready mr beckett
get ready here they come
its adam and eve
not adam and steve
thou shalt not lie with mankind
do you see this as a gay rights issue
i am not political
i just want what is fair what is right
but you are gay arent you
i dont see how thats any of your business
but yes i am
totally irrelevant
it doesnt matter
do you think that homosexuals
deserve special treatment
hell no
were standing here in philadelphia
the city of brotherly love
the birthplace of freedom
where the founding fathers authored
the declaration of independence
and i dont recall that glorious document
saying anything about
all straight men are created equal
i believe it says
all men are created equal
give me a goddamn break
as far as someone being fired
from a law firm or a business
if we found that their action
was discriminatory
they could no longer do business
with the city
thank you mayor
joe
listen youre
youre not getting a little light
in the sneakers are you pal
yeah i am filko
im
im changing
im on the prowl
and im looking for a hunk
not just any hunk
i mean a man a real man like you
come on you can tell everybody about it
you know what we do
you want to play sailor
you remember
im columbus youre the first mate
hey knock if off thats not funny
let me tell you something
these people make me sick filko
but a laws been broken
you remember the law dont you
at least we agree on one thing joe
whats that charlie
tuttifruttis make me sick too
ms benedict is it true that you
worked for walsh ulmer  brahm
three years ago at the same time
as walter kenton
thats correct
and at that time did walter kenton know
the ks lesions on your face and arms
were caused by aids
definitely
i told all the partners
how did walter kenton treat you
after you told him you had aids
every time hed come in contact with me
hed get this look on his face
i refer to it as the oh god expression
as in oh god here comes
that woman with aids
thank you ms benedict
no more questions your honor
ms benedict how did you
contract the aids virus
through a transfusion
i lost a lot of blood
giving birth to my second child
so in other words in your case
there was no behavior on your part
which caused you to be infected
with the virus
it was something that you were unable
to avoid isnt that correct
i guess
thank you
but i dont consider myself any different
from anyone else with this disease
im not guilty im not innocent
im just trying to survive
thank you ms benedict
no further questions at this time
your honor
you may step down mrs benedict
beyond noticing the marks on his face
were there other things about
his appearance miss burton
that made you suspect
that andrew had aids
well he was getting thinner
and he seemed very tired sometimes
but he was working so hard
still i felt something was wrong
and i cant believe that
theyre trying to pretend
that they didnt notice anything
objection
just answer the question please
have you ever felt discriminated
against at wyantwheeler
well yes
in what way
well
mr wheelers secretary lydia
said that mr wheeler had
a problem with my earrings
really
apparently mr wheeler felt they were
too ethnic is the word she used
and she told me that
he said he would like it
if i wore something a little less garish
a little smaller and more
american
whatd you say
i said my earrings are american
theyre africanamerican
lets have order please
thank you no more questions
miss burton
werent you recently promoted
yes im in charge
of the paralegal department
congratulations on your unfettered
ascendancy at wyantwheeler
well i dont know if id go so far
as to call it unfettered
i dont understand
how do you explain
the promotion of an obviously
intelligent articulate
qualified africanamerican woman
in a firm which practices discrimination
as wantonly and consistently
as you and mr beckett claim
i cant explain it
could it be
that these
instances of discrimination
are in fact misunderstandings
that have been blown
completely out of proportion
i think counsel tends
to oversimplify the issue somewhat
well thank you miss burton
ill take that note under consideration
hows the trial going
excuse me
its a great case i saw you on television
im a law student at penn
oh
howre you doing
im all right how are you
all right
saw me on tv
yeah
its a good school penn good school
what year are you in
second
good
listen i just want to tell you
this case its tremendously important
and i just wanted to let you know
i think youre doing a fantastic job
hey
thank you
look when you graduate
you give me a call
okay
all right
thank you
all right
thank you very much
take it easy
listen joe
yeah
would you like to have a drink with me
i just finished a game
and i could use a beer you know
no i cant you know my wife is
i dont pick up people
in drugstores every day
what you think im gay
arent you
what is the matter with you
do i look gay to you
do i look gay to you
joe relax
no what do you mean relax
you know i ought to kick
your faggoty little ass
take it as a compliment jeez
you know that is exactly
the kind of bullshit
that makes people hate your little
faggoty ass
you want to try and kick my ass joe
asshole
no youre the asshole buddy
please continue miss ohara
we were going crazy
looking for this complaint
i felt like i was in the twilight zone
mr beckett was screaming at everybody
and he just he looked so freaky
and mr kenton kept saying
you lost the highline complaint
and he called mr wheeler
and all of a sudden
jamey comes in
with the complaint in his hand
he says it was in central files andy
central files
yes central files is a place
where paperwork is sent
when cases are closed
well jamey ran it
over to the court just in time
and everybody just stood there
completely wasted
and mr
and mr beckett just kept saying
im sorry sorry i dont understand this
thank you miss ohara
no further questions at this time
your honor
all right mr miller
may i
certainly
thank you
you okay
yes
you want a glass of water or something
no
was andy a good boss
yes
he was very sweet
how would you characterize
his work as an attorney
how would i know i just worked for him
excuse me your honor
but is this for the record
mr miller perhaps you should
return to counsels table
yes sir
miss ohara
yes
were you aware
at any time
of any problems that
the senior partners had
with the quality of andrews work
prior to this missing file episode
no no i wasnt
thank you
no more questions your honor
is andrew beckett the kind of lawyer
who misplaces crucial documents
not to my knowledge
no
mr collins if you wanted to
make a lawyer look incompetent
would this be a good way of going about it
hiding an important document
maybe for a few hours
and then making it look like
the responsible lawyer misplaced it
why would mr wheeler and
the others behave so outrageously
because they found out andy was sick
hes not answering the question
perhaps
we have lawyers whove had
heart attacks ulcers
prostate cancer leukemia
no one sandbagged them
did you have something to do
with this file being lost
accidentally on purpose
objection
ill rephrase
did you have anything to do
with this file being misplaced
absolutely not
are you a homosexual
what
are you a homosexual
answer the question are you a homo
are you a faggot you know a punk
queen pillow biter fairy
bootie snatcher rump roaster
are you gay
objection
order
order
where did this come from
suddenly counsels attacking
his own witness
mr collins sexual orientation
has nothing to do with this case
please have a seat miss conine
would you approach the bench mr miller
could you kindly share with me
exactly whats going on inside your head
because at this moment
i dont have a clue
your honor
everybody in this courtroom
is thinking about
sexual orientation
you know sexual preference
whatever you want to call it
who does what to whom
and how they do it
i mean theyre looking at andrew beckett
theyre thinking about it
theyre looking at mr wheeler
miss conine even you your honor
theyre wondering about it
trust me
i know that theyre looking at me
and thinking about it
so lets just get it out in the open
lets get it out of the closet
because this case is not
just about aids is it
so lets talk about
what this case is really all about
the general publics hatred our loathing
our fear of homosexuals
and how that climate of hatred and fear
translated into the firing
of this particular homosexual
my client andrew beckett
please have a seat mr miller
very good
in this courtroom mr miller justice is blind
to matters of race creed color religion
and sexual orientation
with all due respect your honor
we dont live in this courtroom
though do we
no we dont
however as regards to this witness
im going to sustain the defenses objection
how many weeks at a time
would you be out to sea
without stopping at port
anywhere from two weeks
to several months
any women on board
not when i was in the navy
so during these long voyages
months at a time out to sea
no women in sight
hundreds of hardworking
robust young men
in the prime of their lives
at the peak of their natural
appetites and desires
their godgiven hormonal instincts
anything going on
going on like what
like two sailors down below
making flippyflop
objection
mr miller
we had one guy like that
you havent ruled on my objection
your honor
go on mr miller
you had one guy like that
you mean a homosexual
he strutted around quarters naked
trying to get everybody to notice him
made everyone sick
he was destroying our morale
so we let him know this kind
of behavior was not acceptable
howd you do that
whatd you do wrote him a letter
we stuck his head in a latrine
after ten of us had used it
you taught him a lesson didnt you
yes we did
just like firing andrew beckett
taught him a lesson
objection
i withdraw
you were aware when you worked
with melissa benedict
that she had aids is that correct
she didnt try to conceal it
so you are aware of the difference
between a bruise and a lesion
is that correct
beckett told me he had been hit
by a racquetball and i believed him
didnt you try to avoid contact
with mrs benedict
after you found out she had aids
she says and i quote that you
were repulsed by her you avoided her
is that correct
i felt and i still feel nothing
but the deepest sympathy
and compassion for people like melissa
who contracted this terrible disease
through no fault of their own
okay dont move now
okay
boy its not going through
we may have to flush it out again
the veins closed
weve got to call barbara
nurse ratchett
wait a minute
yeah tell her to come over
look ive
theres so much stuff
that i need to get done
can we can we just skip
the treatment for tonight
no no we are not skipping this treatment
its my arm and its my treatment
and i say skip it
well
you know something
hmm
that stuff is saving your life
whats the matter with you tonight

is look at me
and give me a little of your time man

you are worried
we dont have very much time left

congratulations counselor
congratulations
youve survived what i assume
to be your first gay party intact
let me tell you something andrew
when youre brought up the way i am
the way most people are in this country
theres not a whole lot of discussion
about homosexuality
or what do you call it alternate lifestyles
as a kid youre taught
that queers are funny
queers are weird
queers dress up like their mother
that theyre afraid to fight
that theyre a danger to little kids
and that all they want to do
is to get into your pants
and that pretty much sums up
the general thinking out there
if you want to know the truth about it
thank you for sharing that with me
very well all right lets go over this testimony
weve got a big day on monday
okay first ill ask you
can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined the firm
wyant wheeler hellerman
tetlow  brown
miller

andrew that is not the answer
to the question
but yes i pray
what do you pray for
what do you mean i pray
i pray that i dont know
i pray that my baby is healthy
i pray that my wife made it
through the delivery
i pray that the phillies win the pennant
now can we go through these questions
number one
can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined the firm
wyant wheeler hellerman
tetlow  brown
can you do that for me
theres a possibility i wont be around
to see the end of this trial
yes ive considered that
ive made some provisions
in my will for some charities
miguel will need a lawyer
i know its not your area
i know a good probate lawyer
thank you
youre welcome
now can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined the firm
wyant wheeler hellerman
tetlow  brown
do you mind this music
do you like opera
i am not that familiar with opera andrew
this is my favorite aria
its maria callas
its andrea chenier
umberto giordano
this is madeleine
shes saying how
during the french revolution
the mob set fire to her house
and her mother died saving her
she says look
the place that cradled me is burning
im alone
do you hear the heartache in her voice
can you feel it joe
now in come the strings
and it changes everything
the music it fills with a hope
now itll change again listen
listen
i bring sorrow to those who love me
oh that single cello
it was during this sorrow
that love came to me
a voice filled with harmony
it said live still
i am life
heaven is in your eyes
is everything around you
just the blood and the mud
i am divine
i am oblivion
i am the god
that comes down
from the heavens to the earth
and makes of the earth a heaven

place your left hand on the bible
raise your right hand
do you swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
so help you god
i do
please be seated
andrew
can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined the firm
wyant wheeler hellerman
tetlow  brown
wyantwheeler
aggressively recruited me
they were the most
prestigious firm in philadelphia
full of opportunity
and i was impressed with the partners
including charles wheeler
particularly charles
what impressed you about him
he was the kind of lawyer
i thought i wanted to be
and what kind of lawyer is that
possessed of an encyclopedic
knowledge of the law
a razorsharp litigator genuine leader
gifted at bringing out
the very best in others
an awesome ability to illuminate
the most complex of legal concepts
to a colleague to a courtroom
to the man in the street
the kind of person who can
play three sets of tennis
but doesnt sweat
underneath an elegant surface
he has an adventurous spirit
so in the years you worked
at wyantwheeler
did you ever tell charles wheeler
you were gay
no i didnt
why not
you dont bring your personal life
into a law firm
youre not supposed to have
a personal life really
anyway i did plan to tell charles eventually
but then this something happened
at the racquet club
about three and ha three years ago
somebody started telling some jokes
what do you call a woman
who has pms and esp
at the same time
i dont know roger
what do you call her
a bitch who knows everything
sounds like someone i know
hey walter how does
a faggot fake an orgasm
he throws a quart of hot yogurt
on your back
that reminds me of the hairdresser
howd that make you feel
relieved
that i never told him i was gay
just very relieved
all right
are you a good lawyer andrew
im an excellent lawyer
what makes you an excellent lawyer
i love the law
i know the law
i excel at practicing
what do you love about the law andrew
i many things
what i love the most about the law
yes
is that every now and again
not often but occasionally
you get to be a part of
justice being done
that really is
quite a thrill when that happens
thank you andrew
you said earlier you
aspire to be the kind of person
who had an adventurous spirit
is that correct
something like that
do you take risks
in my work yes calculated risks
you have to
did your doctor ever tell you
to reduce stress
that long hours
and stressful working conditions
might damage the immune system
and speed up your illness
my doctor mentioned the impact aids
excuse me
my doctor mentioned the impact stress
could have on the immune system
have you ever been to the
stallion showcase cinema
on 21st street
ive been to that
ive been to that theater
three times in my life
what kind of movies do they show there
gay movies
gay pornographic movies
yes
objection your honor
your honor this line of questioning
is vital to the issue of credibility
lets
lets see where this is going
continue counselor
do men have sex with each other
in that theater
some men
have you ever had sex
with anyone in that theater
im robert
andy
yes
once
when
approximately what year
did that event take place
i guess it was
84 85
were you aware in 1984 85
that there was a fatal disease
out there called aids
and that you could contract it
through sexual activity
id heard of some
id heard of a thing
the gay plague the gay cancer
we didnt know how you could get it
or that it killed you
do you need a break mr beckett
no
no i could use some water though
john could you bring mr beckett
some water please
while you were employed at wyantwheeler
you did everything you could
to make sure no one knew that
you were an active homosexual
is that correct
no
thats not correct i never lied about it
as a homosexual
one is often forced
to conceal ones sexuality
isnt that right
in some circumstances yes
isnt it true that youve spent your life
pretending to be something youre not
so much so that the art
of concealment and dishonesty
has become second nature
your honor i object
ill withdraw it your honor
mr beckett were you living with
miguel alvarez
in 1984 or 85
when you had your
anonymous sexual encounter
in the porn theater
yes
so you could have infected him
isnt that right
miguel has not been infected
you didnt answer my question
you could have infected
mr alvarez at that time
is that correct
yes
youve testified that
the lesions on your face
were visible to the people
that you worked with correct
thats right
and its your contention
that when the partners
were made aware of the lesions
that they leapt to the conclusion
that you had aids and they fired you
is that correct
as painful as it is
to accuse my former colleagues
of such reprehensible behavior
it is the only conclusion i could come to
do you have any lesions
on your face at this time
one
here right by my ear
your honor may i approach the witness
yes you may
remembering that youre under oath
answering truthfully
can you see the lesions
on your face in this mirror
from three feet away
answering truthfully
well at the time i was fired
i had four lesions
and they were much bigger
could you answer the question please
well no no i cant really see it
no
no more questions your honor
i think this would be a good time
to break for today
we can reconvene in the morning
i hate this case
your honor may i have
five minutes in redirect
mr beckett can you
go on for five minutes
three minutes
yes yes
may i borrow your mirror please
andrew
do you have any lesions
on any part of your body
at this time that resemble
the lesions you had on your face
at the time that you were fired
yes
on my torso
your torso if it please the court
i would like to ask andrew
to remove his shirt
so that you know everyone here
could get an accurate idea
of what were talking about
objection
your honor it would
unfairly influence the jury
your honor if andrew was forced
to use a wheelchair due to his illness
would the defense ask him to park it outside
because it would unfairly influence the jury
come on were talking about aids
were talking about lesions
lets see what were talking about
ill allow it
mr beckett would you please
remove your shirt
my god what a nightmare
he asked for it
andrew
can you see the lesions
on your chest in this mirror
yes
thank you
do you swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help you god
i do
please be seated
mr wheeler
were you aware that andrew beckett
was suffering from aids
at the time of his departure
from wyantwheeler
no
for absolute clarity
did you fire andrew beckett
because he had aids
no i did not fire andrew beckett
because he had aids
mr wheeler can you explain
in a way that leaves no doubt
why you promoted
andrew beckett through your firm
and then most importantly
why you eventually asked him to leave
if youre the owner
of a major league ball club
you recruit the hot rookie
and andy was tremendously
promising as a young attorney
fresh out of penn crackerjack
thats why we went after him
thats why we hired him
and thats why we stuck with him
year after year
why did you give him
opportunity after opportunity
well when you groom someone
the way we groomed andy nurturing him
lavishing all kinds
of special treatment on him
you make quite an investment
we were waiting for the promise
to kick in and deliver
but ultimately we could
no longer ignore the gap
between the reality and the promise
thank you mr wheeler
no more questions at this time
your honor
mr miller
objection
your honor objection
all right mr miller thatll be sufficient
mr wheeler you are magnificent
you are you are my hero
andrew is right you are the greatest
are you gay
objection
how dare you
witness will kindly answer
no i am not a homosexual
isnt it true that when you realized
andrew beckett your golden boy
your future senior partner
was gay and had aids
it drove a stake of fear
right through your heterosexual heart
remembering all the hugs
and the handshakes
the intimate moments in the sauna
the friendly pats on the backside
that you and andrew exchanged
like ive exchanged sometimes
it made you say
my god what does this say about me
objection your honor
the witness will please
respond to the question
mr miller you may tap dance
around me all you wish
with your innuendoes
and lockerroom fantasies
but the truth still remains
that your client worked
when he wanted to work
telling us what he thought
we needed to know
about who he really was
andy insisted on bending the rules
and his work suffered
tremendously in the long run
as a result of that
well you explain this to me
like im a sixyearold mr wheeler
cause i just dont get it
who makes these rules
that youre talking about huh
you
read your bible mr miller
old and the new testament
pretty valuable rules in there
excuse me
andrew
excuse me i cant
andy
excuse me andy
for chrissakes somebody get a doctor
turn over now
call an ambulance please
right away
joe joe joe
an ambulance please
just get an ambulance
let him breathe let him breathe
please make room for him
its not working
no it is making it worse
did you notice any changes whatsoever
in andrews appearance
over the course of the year
leading up to his termination
yes i did
were these changes for the better
or for the worse
sometimes for the better
but generally they were for the worse
mr seidman what did you
think caused these changes
in andys appearance
i was afraid
i suspected andy had aids
order order
thank you your witness
miss conine
mr seidman
did you share your suspicions
with mr wheeler
or any of the other managing partners
at any time before the decision
to fire andrew beckett was made
no no i didnt
i didnt mention it to anyone not even andy
i didnt even give him
a chance to talk about it
and i think im going to regret that
for as long as i live
any more questions miss conine
thats all your honor
now they are saying
that he wasnt a good lawyer
he was mediocre
and the fact that they gave him
the most important lawsuit
that they ever had
for one of their most important clients
now they say that
that doesnt prove anything
because that was just a test
whatd they call it a carrot
yeah whats up doc
to see if he would rise to the occasion
okay okay so
say ive got to send a pilot
into enemy territory
and hes gonna be flying a plane
that costs 350 million
who am i gonna put in that plane
some rookie who cant cut the grade
because i wanna see
if he can rise to the challenge
or am i gonna give that assignment
to my best pilot
my sharpest my most
experienced my top gun
the very best ive got
i just dont get that
would somebody please explain it to me
like im a sixyearold
juror number six
i agree
juror number seven
i agree
juror number eight
agree
juror number nine
i agree
juror number ten
i disagree
juror number 11
i agree
juror number 12

yes your honor we have
for back pay and loss of benefits
we award 143000
for mental anguish and humiliation
we award 100000
and for punitive damages
we award 4782000
you may record the verdict

a reversal on this one
