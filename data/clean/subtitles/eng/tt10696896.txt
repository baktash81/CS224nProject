it must be the same akim

 allison sobbing 
excuse me  ma am 
bill baker 
called about a list 
one moment please 
bill  i don t know
how much you remember
about the case  but
allison came here for college 
and that s where
she met this girl  lina 
allison and lina were   
together 
and one night
they got in a big fight 
and allison went to a bar 
that s where she met
this akim guy 
and they had some drinks 
he stole her purse  and   
when allison got home 
she found lina dead
and called the police 
and they never could find
this akim 
he s the one who killed lina 
what do you think 
mm hmm 
you speak english  right 
english 
yes  i am 
 whispers  
fuck 
give me back the letter 
 doorbell buzzes 
man  calls out  
mr  baker 
please 
my office 
i was in service
at the time of this case 
in the police 
have you talked
to this okonedo 
  the professor 
  no  sir 
i see why your lawyer
doesn t want to help 
some kid at a party
hears gossip about a murder 
maybe she remembers
this famous case 
why now  it was five years ago 
that s    that s how long my
kid s been in jail  five years 
does she know we are meeting 
your kid 
no  sir 
are you rich  mr  baker 
no  sir 
this is a dna case 
it means two steps 
first  i look for
the young man 
that will not be easy 
people will talk 
he will try to disappear 
then  if i find this akim 
i have to get
a sample of his dna
and use my connections
in the police to test it
against the dna
from the crime scene 
how much 
 12 000 
euros 
thank you for your time 
mr  baker 
do you believe
your daughter is innocent 
i know she is 
then maybe it s not so much
to see her go free 
 lock beeps 
 mouse clicks 
  excuse me  ma am 
  yes 
  ask you a question  please 
  yes  of course

mint tea 
i want to talk to the girl
you told allison about
from the party 
yes  i assumed as much 
to be honest  i ve always felt
guilty about what happened 
i should ve warned allison 
warned her  about what 
well  i knew allison and lina
were sleeping together 
but i had no idea
lina had moved in with her 
i try to not be cynical about
these type of relationships   
poor girl from the ghetto 
rich american student   
but then i end up
being guilty of naivete 
allison grew up poor 
she isn t rich 
educated 
there is a lot of resentments
towards the cultural elite 
but i m sure
you re aware of that 
what about the girl
from the party 
  my student 
  yeah 
her name is souad

the outreach program 
the same one lina and allison
were involved with
when they met 
and she heard some guy
talking about lina s murder 
this is what she told me 
could i talk to her 
she ll talk to you  yes

souad doesn t speak english

i read about the case   
so you re some kind
of expert now 
no  i m not 
the press was against us 
all they cared about was
allison was sleeping

bunch of   
fake news scumbags 
that s why you punched
that english reporter 
i was drinking then 
allison  hey  did you
tell gram about leparq

so let me tell you 
it will be a serious mistake
to commit a crime
to prove your daughter innocent 
it will not get her out of jail 
and it will send you in 
  do you understand 
  how fast can you do it 
it s hard to say 
a week at least 
but it will cost you 
bill 
here s 3 000 now 
i ll give you another 3 000
when you get it done 
but it s got to be quicker
than a week 
even if it matches 
i still have to find this guy

you know where he is 
he could still disappear
before the results come back 
he won t 
call me when you get it done

shit 
 akim grunts 
 muffled grunting 
allison  i learned
something new actually 
it s helped me a lot 
it s something called
the  mektub  
a nurse told me about it 
it s about acceptance 
acceptance of what 
your fate 
it s helping me
to stop struggling so much 
stop questioning everything 
you just embrace your fate
and learn to live in peace
with it 
it s a muslim idea 
it s about   
letting go of all of that   
   shame   
   and guilt
that pushes you down
and keeps you down
and makes you feel
so powerless 
and that s how i felt
for a really long time 
powerless and forgotten 
and   
that makes living really hard 
you know what i mean 
but you re innocent 
so we got to keep fighting 
it doesn t matter
that i m innocent  dad 
it s not about justice 
it s about finding peace 
 urine spattering 
i don t know
what you re saying 
but you re wasting your breath 
we re gonna wait for that dna 
and then we ll know

 sobbing 
 both sobbing 
 phone ringing 
mr  baker 
i ve come with some
extraordinary news 
the judge in your daughter s
case called me this morning 
new evidence has surfaced 
apparently  a retired cop
came up with a dna match
on the unknown sample 
it also matched
a sample the police collected
on a burglary case
four years ago 
after the trial 
did they catch him 
no  not yet 
but all we need to prove
is sufficient doubt 
so even if they can t
find the suspect 
there s a real chance
they will release allison 
in fact  the judge
has already agreed
to reopen the investigation 
which is almost unheard of 
i think this could only happen
in marseille 
thank you for coming
to tell me  ma am 
mr  baker  this is
the best possible outcome
for your family 
do you understand 
i do 
thank you  ma am
