allison came here for college
and thats where
she met this girl lina
allison and lina were
together
and one night
they got in a big fight
and allison went to a bar
thats where she met
this akim guy
and they had some drinks
he stole her purse and
when allison got home
she found lina dead
and called the police
and they never could find
this akim
hes the one who killed lina
what do you think
mmhmm

doorbell buzzes
man calls out
mr baker
please
my office
i was in service
at the time of this case
in the police
have you talked
to this okonedo
the professor
no sir
i see why your lawyer
doesnt want to help
some kid at a party
hears gossip about a murder
maybe she remembers
this famous case
why now it was five years ago
thats thats how long my
kids been in jail five years
does she know we are meeting
your kid
no sir
are you rich mr baker
no sir
this is a dna case
it means two steps
first i look for
the young man
that will not be easy
people will talk
he will try to disappear
then if i find this akim
i have to get
a sample of his dna
and use my connections
in the police to test it
against the dna
from the crime scene
how much
euros
thank you for your time
mr baker

to be honest ive always felt
guilty about what happened
i shouldve warned allison
warned her about what
well i knew allison and lina
were sleeping together
but i had no idea
lina had moved in with her
i try to not be cynical about
these type of relationships
poor girl from the ghetto
rich american student
but then i end up
being guilty of naivete
allison grew up poor
she isnt rich
educated
there is a lot of resentments
towards the cultural elite
but im sure
youre aware of that
what about the girl
from the party
my student
yeah
her name is souad

its helping me
to stop struggling so much
stop questioning everything
you just embrace your fate

with it
its a muslim idea
its about
letting go of all of that
shame
and guilt
that pushes you down
and keeps you down
and makes you feel
so powerless
and thats how i felt
for a really long time
powerless and forgotten
and
that makes living really hard
you know what i mean

mr baker
ive come with some
extraordinary news
the judge in your daughters
case called me this morning
new evidence has surfaced
apparently a retired cop
came up with a dna match
on the unknown sample
it also matched
a sample the police collected
on a burglary case
four years ago
after the trial
did they catch him
no not yet
but all we need to prove
is sufficient doubt
so even if they cant
find the suspect
theres a real chance
they will release allison
in fact the judge
has already agreed
to reopen the investigation
which is almost unheard of
i think this could only happen
in marseille
thank you for coming
to tell me maam
mr baker this is
the best possible outcome
for your family
do you understand
i do
thank you maam
