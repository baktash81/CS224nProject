the soui of your servant  peter   
   whom you have commanded to
go forth today from this world 
do not hand him over to the enemy 
and do not forget him forever   
   but command that this soui
be taken up by the holy angels   
   and brought home to paradise 
so that  since he hoped   
   and believed in you  he may not
undergo the punishments of hell   
  i m so sorry  he was a friend

dad 
what are you doing here 
you can take a couple of weeks off 
your grandfather saved
all of his life   
   to bring the family
to this country 
he got a good job in the stockyards 
he had a nice little house   
   south chicago 
i was about 12 
somebody sold him on the idea
he ought to move to the country   
   and become a dairy farmer 
well   
   he buys some land  you know 
and gets a couple hundred cows 
within five months  every one of
those cows was dead with disease 
it was the depression 
couldn t sell the land 
there was no work 
so one day   
   he took off 
didn t come back 
my brothers and me  we split up   
   to live with friends and relatives 
chasing a stupid dream   
   causes nothing but you and
everyone around you heartache 
notre dame is for rich kids   
   smart kids   
   great athletes  it s not for us 
you re a ruettiger 
there s nothing wrong with that 
you can have a damn nice life 
frank is gonna take over
plant number two

   of the sacrifices
you ll have to make 
i am 
i ll do whatever it takes 
what brought you here today 
i just came from my best friend s
funerai  he said that 
of course 
what do you mean   of course  
well  it s very common for people   
   suffering a crisis to seek
escape into the cloth 
  we recommend a grieving 
  escape into the cloth 
that s just an expression
that we use   
   for those who are running away from
emotionai or psychologicai pain   
   by choosing priesthood 
you think i want to become a priest 
don t you 
nothing against being a priest 
but i don t think it s for me 
why are you here 
i want to go to schooi at notre dame 
well  have you applied 
no  my grades have never been
very good  even though i tried 
but i ll try harder  i ll study
20 hours a day if i have to 
this university 
it s not for everybody 
ever since i was a kid 
i wanted to go to schooi here 
and ever since i was a kid 
everyone said it couldn t be done 
my whole life  people have been telling
me what i could do and couldn t do 
i ve always listened to them 
believed in what they said 
i don t want to do that anymore

but anyway   
   i ve been working at a steei mill
for about four years 
and i ve been saving up my money 
and i ve been planning on
coming here  but   
my friend pete really understood
what my dream was 
and he told me not to
waste any more time 
but i don t know 
for some reason  i couldn t 
see  he died in an accident on friday 
and i came here right after
the funerai 
you see what i mean 
son   
   i think you re in the wrong office 
come on  now 
i don t understand 
you might want to go and talk
to father cavanaugh

he did 
he said that if i got good enough
grades at holy cross 
  and i will  i promise  that
i d be admitted here officially 
i just wanted to introduce myself and
say i look forward to practice 
  thank you 
  so long 
sorry 
for us  divine inspiration does not
mean that god possesses a man   
   and simply dictates
the inspired text to him 
rather   
   that god implants into a man s mind
the generai concept 
when god does that   
   he allows the man to write that
in his historicai context 
the sitz im leben  or 
 that is the setting in life   
so a man may have
historicai inaccuracies   
   but god allows
those misunderstandings   
   because what is important
and inherent   
   is the theologicai concept that
god is getting across to mankind 
i think that s all for today 
we will have a quiz on monday 
so please prepare yourselves for it 
well done  father 
please grade these for me 
  appreciate it  thank you 
  certainly 
you learning stenography or what 
everything he s mouthing
is in the book

let me tell it to you
as clean as i can 
we have 95 players here   
   so accomplished
as athletes in high school   
   they have full scholarships to the
best football program in the country 
ncaa regulations allow us
to dress just 60 for home games   
   which means at least
35 scholarship players   
   will be watching the game
from the stands 
so if any of you has any fantasies   
   about running out of that tunnei
with your helmet shining in the sun   
   you best leave them right here 
of you 15 dreamers out there 
maybe we ll keep one or two 
my job is to basically beat the shit
out of you for the next five days 
and whoever is still
standing at the end   
   maybe we ll use
for our scout teams 
you ll be running the opposition s plays
week in and week out 
your greatest value to us is 
we don t care whether you get hurt 
our first teams are gonna pound on you
like you re their worst enemies 
like what you hear so far 
any of you want to run home to mama 
now s your chance 
joe  they re all yours 
don t just stand there trying to
think  let s hit those ropes  move it 
move it  i said  come on 
pick them up  pick them up  high
knees  let s go  gentlemen  let s go 
pump your arms 
keep your heads up 
that s it  don t step on that rope 
up and down  let s go 
we want to see how quick you are here 
keep it rolling  keep it rolling 
heads up  keep moving  keep moving 
pump those arms  pump those arms
when you re backwards running 
move it  move it  move it 
keep your heads up

i d get rid of all of them 
if they can t protect themselves

  he s put more effort than anybody 
  you fellows decide 
not in my defensive backfield 
you want him  you got him 
all right  shower up 
we ll let you know 
you think you made it 
unfortunately  yeah 
what is so unfortunate
about making the team 
this is my third year as a walk on 
i had scholarships
to two big ten schools 
but my father was
an all american here   
   so i get a lot of family pressure 
i don t understand 
if you haven t been cut 
then you still have a chance 
  what  a chance to play 
  yeah 
the only reason they keep me on
here is because i m a legacy 
to them i m no more valuable
than a tackling dummy 
ruettiger  come with me 
yeah  coach 
you want on the team pretty bad 
you have no idea 
  you sure busted your balls out there 
  coach  i ll do anything 
you think you can give
the same effort   
   day in and day out
for the next five months 
sir  i have no doubt 
fine 
if you do lighten up one hair   
   i ll throw you off this team
so fast you won t know what hit you 
wait a minute

for at least 15 more minutes 
hey  jim 
your bullshit out there makes us
look bad  so diai it down a notch 
diai it down 
everybody s sick and tired of hearing 
 put out more like ruettiger   
what do you get out of
getting your head kicked in 
it s not worth it  you know 
you gotta be in at least one play
during a game   
   to officially be part of this team 
the only uniform you ll put on is
that grungy thing you ve been wearing 
if you hate it so much 
why don t you just quit 
i can t 
why not 
if i quit  my father
won t pay my tuition 
is that why you re here 
i m under the delusion that i might
get a chance to run out that tunnei 
does he think i m iying to him 
nobody said nothing about iying 
i have to get pictures taken
of practice to prove i m on the team 
i believe you 
what happened to my face 
where did i get these 
  so you re a glorified waterboy 
  oh  you just don t get it 
if you are on that team  my opinion
of notre dame just hit the shits 
leave him alone 
there s no  if   
i wear a uniform  i block and tackle 
you just don t understand 
actually  it s simple 
every saturday when we turn on
the tv to watch   
   we see players wearing the blue
and gold  we just don t see you 
you will 
  what 
  you will  now shoot 
just shoot 
coach  rudy ruettiger s
here to see you 
send him in 
this won t take long  coach 
first  i d like to thank you for
the opportunity of being on the team 
i never thought i d be saying this   
   but it s been a pleasure 
now what can i do for you 
well  one of the many things
that i ve learned this year   
   is that no matter how hard i try 
i ll never get above the prep team 
i ve accepted that god made some
people football players  but not me 
i wish god would put your heart
in some of my players  bodies 
my father loves notre dame football
more than anything else in the world 
he doesn t believe i m on the team   
   because he can t see me
during the games 
next year  my senior year  i d love
to be able to give him this gift 
i d really appreciate it if you d
let me dress one game next season 
look  rudy   
   the ncaa really hamstrings us
with this 60 rule 
in some positions
we only have one backup 
you know every year we re competing
for the nationai championship 
is this just for your father 
no  it s for everybody who told me
that it would be impossible 
it s for my brothers   
   the kids in my high schooi 
the guys i work with at the mill 
they can t come to practice
and see that i am part of the team 
okay 
you deserve it  you ll dress
for one game next season 
thank you  coach

he s waltzing with him 
forty yards for
a notre dame touchdown 
it s the fourth quarter with 3 minutes
to play and the issue still in doubt 
as barratt fades back to pass for
georgia tech from his 30 yard line 
looks upfield  throws 
intercepted by roland steele 
he has a convoy of blockers
down the sidelines 
steele going in unmolested
for a notre dame touchdown

notre dame all over the ball 
thompson recovers for the irish 
37 seconds remaining and it ll be
all over here at notre dame 
to our left   
   i m picking up a chant
from the notre dame student body 
can t quite make out just what it is 
devine s gonna empty his bench with
a little time remaining in the game 
one of the players going
into the game is jamie o hare 
o hare was heavily recruited throughout
the countrt several years ago 
he came to notre dame   
   and it s safe to say that
his career has been a disappointment 
they re chanting for rudy 
tell him to go to a knee 
listen up 
victory formation 
the hell with devine 
if the offense is here 
rudy can t play 
  we gotta run the play 
  no  we gotta score now 
  let s get a score for rudy

all right  this one s yours 
pro right 
38 halfback pass on one 
on one  ready

touchdown  notre dame  23 
georgia tech  3 
that was for you 
what was that 
who called that play 
it s just occurred to me   
   what they ve been chanting
for the last few minutes 
it s the name  rudy   
dan ruettiger  a walk on senior   
   subject of an article in yesterday s
student newspaper  the observer 
all right  go get  em  kid
