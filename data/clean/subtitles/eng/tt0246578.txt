frankie feedler

somebody was watching over him 
mrs farmer will bring you home
after practice  bye  honey 
donnie     good luck 
  oh  my god  tell me everything 
  i m not allowed to talk about it 
  oh  my god 
  hi  cherita 
  shut up 
  darko cheats death  huh 
you re a celebrity  i called you
a jillion times  where you been 
  at a hotel 
  dad saw you at the golf course 
  you sleep walking again  buddy 
  i don t want to talk about it 
now that you re famous 
have a smoke 
what happens
if you tell mom and dad  sam 
  you ll put ariel in the garbage disposal 
  goddamn right  i will 
  so grody 
  hey  cherita  you want a cigarette 
  shut up 
   shut up  
go back to china  bitch 
just leave her alone 
  that s some good shit  huh 
  it s a fucking cigarette 
 there would be headlines
in the papers 
the grown up gangs who ran
the betting at the wrestling    
and the barrow boys
would hear with respect    
of how old misery s house
had been destroyed 
it was as though this plan had
been with him all his life 
pondered through the seasons 
now  in his 15th year 
crystallised with the
pain of puberty  
what is graham greene trying
to communicate with this passage 
why did the children
break into old misery s house 
  joanie 
  they wanted to rob him 
if you had actually
read the short story 
which was a whopping 13 pages 
you d know that the children    
find a great deal of money
in the mattress  but burn it 
donnie darko  perhaps with your
recent brush with mass destruction 
you can give us your opinion 
they say it when they flood the
house  when they tear it to shreds 
that destruction
is a form of creation 
so burning the money is ironic 
they just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart 
they want to change things 
  may we help you 
  yeah  i just registered 
  they put me in the wrong class 
  you look like you belong here 
um     where do i sit 
sit next to the boy
you think is the cutest 
quiet 
let her choose 
joanie  get up 
what people don t understand
is that dukakis    
does not have
the financial infrastructure 
well  the construction guys    
say it will take about a week
to fix the roof 
airline better not fuck us
on the shingle match 
  they still don t know 
  know what 
  where it came from 
  oh  no  they can t tell us 
something about a matching
serial number that got burned 
i had to sign a form saying i
wouldn t talk to anyone about it 
so we can t tell anyone
what nobody knows 
yeah  but you tell    
what s your doctor s name 
  dr  thurman  dad 
  yes  tell dr  thurman whatever you want 
  dad 
  what 
  dad 
  oh     
what s that woman doing
in the middle of the damn road  
no mail today  maybe tomorrow 
what did she say to you 
  i made a new friend 
  real or imaginary 
  imaginary 
  would you like to talk about this friend 
  frank 
  frank 
  what did he say 
  he said to follow him 
  follow him  where 
  into the future 
and then what happens 
and then he said    
then he said that the world
was coming to an end 
do you think
the world is coming to an end 
no 
that s stupid 
for my entire life
i was a victim of my own fear 
love 
i was feeding fear with food 
fear 
finally  i looked in the mirror 
not just in the mirror 
i looked through the mirror 
in that image 
i saw my ego reflection 
for two years 
i thought it was normal    
for a 10 year old to wet the bed 
shh  quiet 
but the solution
was there all the time 
i m not afraid any more 
all over america  people have
come together to join hands 
people who believe that human life
is absolutely too important 
too valuable and too precious
to be controlled by fear 
pay close attention 
you could miss something 
hello  my name is jim cunningham
and welcome to  controlling fear  
     and the prince
was led into a world    
of strange and beautiful magic  
wow 
 the last unicorn 
by samantha darko 
  give it back 
   there was once a unicorn named ariel     
  you wrinkled it 
  it s not wrinkled  sam 
it s 7 45  the bus should ve

mom and i had to change our names 
i thought gretchen ross

i was in jail once  i mean    
i burned down this house 
it was abandoned 
but i got held back in school    
and i can t drive till i m 21 
but i m over all of that 
i m     painting and stuff

maybe a painter  maybe both    
i ll write a book
and draw the pictures 
then maybe people will understand
me  i don t know  change things 
donnie darko   what the hell kind
of name is that 
it s like a superhero or something 
what makes you think i m not 
i should go  for physics  monnitoff
is having me write this essay  
the greatest invention
ever to benefit mankind 
it s monnitoff 
but that s easy  anti septics 
like  the whole sanitation thing 
joseph lister  1895 
before anti septics  there was no
sanitation  especially in medicine 
you mean soap 
well  i m really glad
school was flooded today 
why is that 
we d never have had
this conversation 
you re weird 
sorry 
no  that was a compliment 
well  look  uh    
you want to go with me 
  where do you want to go 
  no  i mean  like   go  with me 
  you know  like  going together  
  sure 
ok  where are you going 
i m going home 
stupid      where are you going  
i d like to try something new 
have you ever been hypnotised 
no 
when i clap twice  you will
wake up  do you understand 
  yes 
  so  tell me about your week 
i met a girl 
what is her name 
gretchen 
we re going together now 
do you still think
about girls a lot 
yeah 
  how are things going at school 
  i think about girls a lot 
i asked you about school  donnie 
i think about fucking
a lot during school 
what else do you think about
during school 
 married with children  
  you think about your family 
  i just turn down the volume    
and think about fucking
christina applegate 
i asked you about your family 
no 
i don t think about fucking
my family  that s gross 
i d like to hear
about your friend frank 
sam bylan 
cherita chen 
donald darko 
daye dennis 
hey  you fuck 
did you say i flooded the school 
  i didn t say shit 
  yeah  well  they think i did it 
if you re innocent  then you have
nothing to worry about  right 
fuck you  you know what i think 
i think you did it 
beer and pussy   that s all i need 
  we gotta find ourselves a smurfette 
  smurfette 
mm hm 
not some tight ass middlesex chick 
like  this cute little blonde    
that ll get down with the guys
like smurfette does 
smurfette doesn t fuck 
that s bullshit  why do you think
papa smurf made her 
because the other smurfs
were getting too horny 
not vanity 
i heard he was a homosexual 
then she fucks them
while vanity watches 
what about papa smurf 
he must get some action 
what he does 
he films the gang bang 
later on  he beats off to the tape 
first of all  papa smurf didn t
create smurfette  gargamel did 
she was sent as gargamel s evil spy
to destroy the smurf village 
but the overwhelming goodness
of the smurfs transformed her 
and as for the whole gang bang
scenario  it just couldn t happen 
smurfs are asexual 
they don t even have    
reproductive organs
under those little white pants 
that s what s so illogical
about being a smurf 
what s the point of living
if you don t have a dick 
donnie  why you gotta get
smart on us 
grandma death 
excuse me  excuse me 
stay off the road  miss sparrow 
or i will call social services 
i hate that miss farmer 
she s such a fucking bitch 
yeah 
  how old is grandma death 
  101 
she does the same thing every day 
just walks back and forth
and back and forth to the mailbox 
nothing ever in there 
oh  wait  wait  wait    
she s going back to the box 
we may still have mail 
  mail  mail  mail 
  here it is 
this could be it  oh     
oh  no dice  grandma  sorry 
someone ought to write that bitch 
authorities continued
their search    
for a suspect in the middlesex
ridge school vandalism 
the private school
has asked for donations    
to restore its beloved mascot 
known only as the mongrel    
it s very helpful 
there s a good turnout tonight 
what are you trying
to accomplish here 
there was urine and faeces
flooded in my office 
whatever fits 
 whatever fits  
in cooperation
with the county police 
we have begun
an active investigation    
into the cause of the flooding 
and our suspects include
several of our own students    
i want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children 
kitty  i would appreciate
if you would wait    
dr cole  not only am i a teacher 
but i am also a parent
of a middlesex child 
therefore i am the
only person here    
who transcends
the parent teacher bridge 
don t worry  you got away with it 
i have in my hand graham greene s
 the destructors  
this short story is part of my
daughter s english assignment 
in this story 
several children destroy    
an elderly man s house
from inside out 
how can you do that 
and how do they do this 
they flood the house
by breaking through a water main 
i can do anything i want 
and so can you 
and i think that this garbage
should be removed 
excuse me 
what is the real issue here 
the pta doesn t ban books 
the pta must acknowledge
that pornography    
is being taught in our curriculum 
  it s meant to be ironic 
  excuse me  go back to grad school 
why did you make me
flood the school 
they are in great danger 
do you even know
who graham greene is 
i think we have all seen  bonanza  
well  um     while we are
on other topics    
where do you come from 
do you believe in time travel 
who are you talking to 
i was just taking my pills  sam 
a storm is coming  frank says 
a storm that will swallow
the children 
and i will deliver them
from the kingdom of pain 
i ll deliver them
back to their doorsteps 
send the monsters
back to the underground 
i ll send them back to a place
where no one else can see them 
except for me 
because i am donnie darko 
who is frank 
a six foot tall bunny rabbit 
in these modern times 
our attitude and beliefs
are so delicate  so fragile 
i have had a  cunning vision  
this vision has released me 
it s important that
our lifeline be rejuvenated 
so that we can breathe again 
it s time to breathe 
it is time to breathe 
thank you  jim cunningham 
thank you  jim cunningham 
so now let us begin lifeline
exercise number one 
please press stop now 
as you can see  the lifeline is
divided into two polar extremes 
fear and love 
fear is in the negative
energy spectrum 
  love is in the positive energy spectrum 
  no  duh    
excuse me 
 no  duh  is a product of fear 
now  on each card
is a character dilemma    
which applies to the lifeline 
please     take this  thank you 
please read each character
dilemma aloud    
and place an  x  on the lifeline
in the appropriate place 
cherita 
 juanita has an important
math test today 
she s known about the test for
several weeks  but has not studied 
in order to keep from failing 
juanita decides
to cheat on the math test  
good  good  very good 
mr  darko 
 ling ling finds a wallet
filled with money 
 she takes it to the address
on the driver s licence    
but keeps the money  
i m sorry  miss farmer 
i don t get this 
just place an  x 
in the appropriate place 
i know what to do  but you can t
lump things into two categories 
the lifeline is divided that way 
well  life isn t that simple 
i mean    
who cares if ling ling
keeps the money 
it has nothing to do
with fear or love 
they are the deepest
human emotions 
ok  but you re not listening to me 
there are other things
to take into account 
the whole spectrum
of human emotion 
you can t just lump everything    
into two categories
and deny everything else 
if you don t complete the
assignment  you ll get a zero 
donald  let me preface
this by saying    
that your iowa test scores
are     intimidating 
so    
let s go over this again 
what exactly
did you say to miss farmer 
i ll tell you  he asked me    
to forcibly insert the lifeline
exercise card into my anus 
nobody cares about responsibility 
morality  family values    
kitty     excuse us  please 
they ve suspended him from
 after school  activities for 6 months 
since this jet engine fiasco 
i don t know what s gotten into    
i ll say this because our daughters
are on the dance team together    
and i respect you 
but after witnessing
your son s behaviour 
i have significant doubts
about your    
our paths through life
must be righteous 
go home and look in the mirror    
and pray that your son doesn t
succumb to the path of fear 
do you remember
that weird gym teacher  mrs  farmer 
yeah  ok  well  my brother told her
to shove a book up her ass today 
and then my parents
just bought him all this new shit 
yeah  i know  i wish a jet engine
would fall on my room 
  dr monnitoff 
  donnie 
i know this is gonna
sound kind of weird 
but do you know anything
about     time travel 
a wormhole with an
einstein rosen bridge 
which is theoretically a wormhole
in space controlled by man 
so  according to hawking 
a wormhole may be able
to provide a short cut    
for jumping between two distant
regions of space time 
so to travel back in time 
you have to have a spaceship    
faster than the speed of light 
  theoretically 
  and be able to find a wormhole 
the basic principles of
time travel are there 
your vessel and portal 
your vessel can be anything 
  like a delorean 
  metal craft of any kind 
you know  i love that movie  it s
so     like  futuristic  you know 
listen  um     don t tell anybody
that i gave you this 
woman who wrote this
used to teach here 
she was a nun long before that 
then overnight she became
this entirely different person 
she up and left the church 
wrote this book    
she started teaching science 
right here at middlesex 
 the philosophy of time travel  
roberta sparrow 
that s right 
roberta sparrow 
roberta sparrow 
grandma death 
it s called
 the philosophy of time travel  
  what does philosophy have to do with it 
  guess who wrote it 
who 
roberta sparrow 
huh  she wrote a book 
  grandma death wrote a book 
  that s a terrible nickname 
we almost ran her down
the other day 
she lives in that piece of crap
house  and you know she s loaded 
  you re right 
  she was known for her gem collection 
kids used to go up there
all the time    
and try to steal stuff from her 
she became a total recluse 
i didn t know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down 
she was just standing
in the road  frozen 
i walked over to see if she was ok 
and she whispered in my ear 
  what did she say 
  i think frank wants me to talk to her 
he asked if i knew
about time travel 
she wrote a book about it 
so that can t be
a coincidence  right 
what did she say to you 
she said that every living creature
on earth dies alone 
how did that make you feel 
it reminded me of my dog callie 
she died when i was eight and she
crawled underneath the     the porch 
to die 
to be alone 
do you feel alone right now 
i don t know    
i d like to believe i m not 
but i just    
i ve just never seen any proof 
so i just don t debate it any more 
i could spend my whole life
debating it over and over    
and still wouldn t have proof 
so i just don t debate it any more 
it s absurd 
the search for god is absurd 
it is if everyone dies alone 
does that scare you 
i don t want to be alone 
and his tapes have
made me realise    
that for the last 39 years  i have
been a prisoner of my own fear 
fear 
you have got to meet
this jim cunningham 
i can t believe he s single 
it has been a disappointing night
for these super bowl champions 
you re right  dan  coach joe gibbs
is on the sidelines 
he s gotta be thinking   what
happened  what went wrong tonight  
  and here s the kick 
  oh 
it s no good    
  shit  we need a quarterback 
  we need a miracle 
we need to go for a safety 
what the future holds for this mvp 
we ll have to wait and see 
you guys want anything 
this week on  who s the boss  
samantha borrows tony s van    
and gets caught without a licence 
better make sure
we don t miss that one 
here we are again 
fourth down now    
tomorrow  we meet our partners    
for the young inventors  fair 
what if you could go back in time
and take those hours of pain    
and replace them
with something better 
  like images 
  yeah  a hawaiian sunset    
or the grand canyon 
things that remind you
how beautiful    
we ve been going together
for two weeks 
yeah 
well  i er     i    
you want to kiss me 
  i m sorry  i    
  look  donnie  wait  i just    
  well  i like you a lot 
  i just want it to be    
at a time when     it    
  when what 
  when it reminds me just    
when it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be 
yeah 
and there s some fat guy
staring at us 
i don t think telling any woman    
to forcibly insert
an object up her anus    
is something that should
go without consequence 
i think we should buy him a moped 
i think we should get a divorce 
  you won t tell mom  will you 
  why would i 
  you tell mom everything 
  no  i don t 
  let me see it 
  no  it s not finished  it s    
ok  it s cool 
that s scary 
you think 
thank you for seeing us
at such late notice 
we both felt
we should come and discuss    
what i think is going on
with your son 
yes 
um     well  he s er    
you know about his past  and he
was suspended from school    
for insulting his gym teacher 
i m not sure that s a good example 
i think he had just cause 
rose  let me lay out
what i believe is happening here 
donnie s aggressive behaviour    
his increased detachment
from reality 
seem to stem from his inability to
cope with the forces in the world    
that he perceives
to be threatening 
has he ever told you about frank 
frank 
yes  the giant bunny rabbit 
the what 
i don t recall
him ever having mentioned a rabbit 
donnie is experiencing    
what is commonly called
a daylight hallucination 
this is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics 
  what can we do 
  i would like to do more hypnotherapy    
    and increase his medication 
whatever will help him  really 
is     that s why we re here 
we just would like him
to experience some relief 
so if you think that more
medication will do that 
then i think
we should give it a try 
it s complicated 
yeah 
there s like a force in your brain
that just sends you someplace 
do you go someplace familiar 
no  but each time i keep waking up
farther from my house 
scary 
donnie darko 
i know 
  good morning  you mongrels 
  good morning 
is that all you can muster 
good morning 
  good morning 
  now  that s a tiny  tiny bit better 
but i still sense some students    
who are actually afraid
to say  good morning  
good morning 
yeah  that s what i like to hear 
too many young men and women today    
are completely paralysed
by their fears 
they surrender their bodies to the
temptation and destruction    
of drugs  alcohol
and premarital sex 
now  i m going to tell you
a little story today 
it s a heartbreakingly sad story
about a young man    
whose life was completely destroyed
by these instruments of fear 
a young man searching for love
in all the wrong places 
his name was frank 
  we re moving through time 
  what 
hi  my stepsister  like 
i sometimes worry
that she eats too much 
  shut up  kim 
  i m just trying to help 
oh  sweetheart  please 
there s no reason
to be embarrassed here 
many times we eat because we are
afraid to face our ego reflection 
we find ourselves
looking at the mirror 
rather than into
and through the mirror 
when we do that  we can finally
see how beautiful we are 
  thanks 
  sure  come up here  don t be afraid 
er  how can i find out what
i wanna be when i grow up 
oh  that s a hard one 
well  look deep inside of yourself 
deep within your heart 
and find what makes you feel love 
pure  unconditional love    
and go to that  in your studies 
in your athletics 
in your relationships 
go towards love 
  thank you 
  come on up 
next 
  how do i learn how to fight 
   how do i learn how to fight  
son  violence is a product of fear 
learn to truly love yourself  
truly love yourself  
and the world will be yours 
  ok 
  get yourself up here 
all right 
  good morning 
  good morning 
um     how much are they
paying you to be here 
er     excuse me 
  what s your name  son 
  gerald 
well  gerald 
i think you re afraid 
do you want us to buy your book 
because that was
the worst advice ever 
see how sad this is 
want your sister to lose weight 
tell her to stop eating twinkies
and play field hockey 
no one knows what they want to be 
it takes time to find that out 
right  jim 
and you    
yeah  you 
sick of some jerk shoving
your head down the toilet 
well  lift some weights    
or take a karate lesson  and next
time kick him in the balls 
son     see this  this is an anger
prisoner  a textbook example 
  prisoner 
  do you see the fear  people 
this boy is scared to death 
son  it breaks my heart
to say this 
but i believe you re a very
troubled and confused young man 
you are searching
in all the wrong places 
you re right  actually 
i am pretty troubled
and pretty confused 
and i m afraid  really  really
afraid  really afraid  but i     i    
i think you re
the fucking antichrist 
it s amazing 
he thinks he s telling the truth 
everything he says
is a fucking lie 
everything he says 
everyone thinks he s so rad 
he s such a fucking chud    
are you ok 
sit down  calm down 
you ever hear of grandma death 
who 
 the philosophy of time travel  
what is this 
she wrote it 
i m     i m seeing stuff    
like really messed up stuff 
that book describes
stuff i ve been seeing 
and it can t just be a coincidence 
she must be in 
she never leaves this house 
maybe she s asleep 
donnie  look 
send her a letter 
each vessel travel along a
vector through space time    
along its centre of gravity 
like a spear 
  pardon 
  like a spear coming out of your chest 
um     sure  yeah 
in order for the vessel
to travel through time 
it s got to find a portal 
a wormhole or    
could these portals     
could these portals
just appear anywhere  any time 
i think that s highly unlikely 
no  you re talking about
an act of god 
if god controls time 
time is pre decided 
i m not following you 
every living thing
follows a set path 
and if you could see your path 
then you could see the future 
that s a form of time travel 
well  you re contradicting
yourself 
if we were able
to see our destinies    
manifest themselves visually 
then we would be given a choice
to betray our destinies 
the mere fact
that this choice exists    
would make all preformed destiny
come to an end 
not if you travel
within god s channel 
i m not going to be able
to continue this conversation 
  why 
  i could lose my job 
ok 
it gives me no pleasure
to deny you    
one of the great writers
of the 20th century 
alas  i have not yet been elected
queen of the universe 
so i must obey the rules 
so  anyone seen in this school
reading this book    
will be suspended 
not to worry 
someone pre ordered a dozen copies
at the sarasota mall bookstore 
in mr  greene s absence 
we will now be reading another
classic    watership down  
here  donnie 
pass these back 
maybe you and frank
can read this one together 
now you know where he lives 
and they grow
out of our     chest  solar plexus 
just like she described  the way
they moved and they smelled 
it s like they re workers 
assigned to each one of us 
they just     they re like liquid 
i followed it
into my parents  bedroom 
what did you find 
nothing 
  so we call them imgs 
  infant memory generators 
you buy these glasses
for your infant 
and they wear them
at night when they sleep 
but inside the glasses
are these slide photographs 
each photograph is of something
peaceful or beautiful 
whatever the parents want 
what effect would it have
on an infant 
well  nobody remembers
their infancy 
anybody who says they do is lying 
so  this will help develop
memory earlier in life 
yeah 
did you consider
that infants need darkness    
as part of their natural
development 
no 
yeah 
what if the parents put in pictures
of satan or dead people 
is that what you d show your kids 
er  well  i mean  didn t your dad 
like  stab your mom 
get out 
gretchen 
gretchen  gretchen 
i m sorry about those guys 
  two for  evil dead   please 
  that ll be  2 
why do you wear
that stupid bunny suit 
why are you wearing
that stupid man suit 
take it off 
what happened to your eye 
why do they call you frank 
it is the name of my father 
and his father before me 
frank    
where s this going to stop 
you should already know that 
watch the movie screen 
there s something
i want to show you 
have you ever seen a portal 
burn it to the ground 
ok  now  girls 
i want you to concentrate 
failure is not an option 
and  bethany  if you feel the need
to vomit up there  just swallow it 
  ok  mom 
  hey  you guys  good luck out there 
now  that was really something 
thank you  cherita chen 
with  autumn angel  
now the moment
we ve all been waiting for 
it is my pleasure to introduce
to you emily bates  suzy bailey 
samantha darko  beth farmer
and joanie james 
they are sparkle motion 
how long was i asleep for 
whole movie 
well  look what the cat dragged in 
how you doing  donnie 
your little sister
was broken hearted    
that you missed
her big show last night 
  dad 
  hm 
i m crazy 
you re not crazy 
i used to be crazy 
but you re not crazy 
  look  you re my only son    
  i know    
no  hold it  i know i m not
the best communicator  but    
whatever happens to you 
be honest  tell the truth 
even if they do look at you
funny   they will 
but what you gotta understand  son 
is that almost all of those
people are full of shit 
they re all part of this great
big conspiracy of bullshit 
and they re scared
of people like you 
because those bullshitters know    
that you re smarter
than all of them 
you know what you say
to people like that  hm 
 fuck you  
the blaze was extinguished
sometime after 8 00 last night 
firefighters discovered
what has been referred to    
as a kiddie porn dungeon 
cunningham  who has become a recent
celebrity  was arrested    
  oh  my god     
while at sarasota heights country club 
arson has not been ruled out
as the cause of the fire 
now a group of
cunning vision employees    
dad played golf with that guy 
    vehemently denied
the alleged link    
to a child pornography
publishing circuit 
in a vicious statement  connie
attacked fire department officials 
claiming a mass conspiracy 
i m sorry  karen 
this is a progressive school 
but we don t feel
your methods are appropriate 
what exactly about my methods
are inappropriate 
i am sorry that you have failed 
now  if you ll excuse me 
i have another appointment 
you can finish out the week 
fuck 
good afternoon  it s a great
pleasure to announce    
that the middlesex ridge school
dance team    
has been invited to perform on
 star search  88  in los angeles 
  i know now a terrible thing is coming 
  what do you mean 
the field  the field 
it s covered with blood 
blood  don t be silly 
all right  it s getting dark 
we should get back to the burrow 
back to the burrow  it ll come
there  it s all around us 
  stop it  fiver 
  we ve got to leave here 
when the other rabbits
hear of fiver s vision 
do they believe him 
why should we care 
because the rabbits are us  donnie 
why should i mourn for a rabbit 
is the death of one species
less tragic than another 
of course  a rabbit s not like us 
it has no history books 
no photographs 
no knowledge of sorrow or regret 
i m sorry  don t get me wrong 
i like rabbits 
they re cute and horny 
if you re cute and horny 
you re happy 
you don t know why you re alive 
you just want to have sex as many
times as possible before you die 
i just don t see the point
in crying over a dead rabbit    
who never even feared death
to begin with 
you re wrong 
these rabbits are the product
of the author s imagination 
he cares for them 
so we care for them 
otherwise we ve just
missed the point 
aren t we forgetting
about the miracle of storytelling 
the deus ex machina 
the god machine 
that s what saved the rabbits 
no  it was ridiculous 
i ll call you back 
  rose 
  kitty 
i m sure you ve heard the horrible
allegations against jim cunningham 
i know  something about
a kiddie porn dungeon    
oh  please  please 
don t use those words 
it s obviously a conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man 
i m spearheading the jim cunningham
defence campaign 
rose  i have to appear at his
arraignment tomorrow morning 
the girls have to leave
for los angeles 
as their coach  i was the obvious
choice to chaperone them 
  but now you can t go 
  yes 
now  believe me 
of all the other mothers 
i would never dream of asking you 
but none of the others
are available 
i don t know  kitty  it s a bad
weekend  eddie s in new york 
rose  i don t know
if you realise    
what an opportunity
this is for our daughters 
this has been a dream of samantha s
and all of ours for a long time 
i made her lead dancer 
sometimes i doubt your commitment
to sparkle motion 
elizabeth will be in charge 
she ll drive you to therapy 
and if you need anything 
you promise me
that you will call dr  thurman 
how does it feel
to have a wacko for a son 
it feels wonderful 
here     sorry  here you are 
  you guys are gonna win  i know it 
  so do i 
here s the keys  there s food
in the fridge and do not    
mom  go

shouldn t you be off with
your friends  scaring old people 
  what s going on 
  i don t know  that s a good question 
i m no longer your english teacher 
they fired me 
that s bullshit 
you re the only good teacher here 
thank you 
what s  cellar door  
this famous linguist once said    
that of all the phrases
in the english language 
of all the endless combinations
of words in all of history 
 cellar door 
is the most beautiful 
 cellar door  
i promise that one day everything s
gonna be better for you 
shut up 
  i want to talk about your past 
  no  
i want to talk
about you and your parents 
they didn t buy me
what i wanted for christmas 
what did you want for christmas
that year 
hungry hungry hippos 
how did you feel  being denied
these hungry hungry hippos 
  regret 
  what else makes you feel regret 
  that i did it again 
  you did it again 
i flooded my school and i burned
down that pervert s house 
i only have a few days left
before they catch me 
did frank tell you
to do these things 
i have to obey him 
he saved my life 
i have to obey him
or i ll be left all alone 
and then    
and then i won t be able to figure
out what this is all about 
i won t know his master plan 
do you mean god s master plan 
do you now believe in god 
i have the power
to build a time machine 
how is that possible 
how is time travel possible 
donnie 
time s up  frank said 
  when is this going to happen 
  soon 
what is going to happen 
  frank is gonna kill 
  who is he going to kill 
  who is he going to kill 
  i can see him 
the sky s gonna open up 
if the sky suddenly opened up 
there would be no law  no rule 
there would only be you
and your memories 
the choices you ve made
and the people you ve touched 
if this world were to end 
there would only be you and him    
and no one else 
you can stop
taking your medication 
they re placebos 
just pills made out of water 
thank you 
donnie    
an atheist is someone who denies
altogether the existence of god 
you re an agnostic 
an agnostic is someone    
who believes that there is
no proof of the existence of god 
but does not deny
a possibility that god exists
