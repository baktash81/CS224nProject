he dodged his photograph
somebody was watching over him
mrs farmer will bring you home
after practice bye honey
donnie  good luck
oh my god tell me everything
im not allowed to talk about it
oh my god
hi cherita
shut up
darko cheats death huh
youre a celebrity i called you
a jillion times where you been
at a hotel
dad saw you at the golf course
you sleepwalking again buddy
i dont want to talk about it
now that youre famous
have a smoke
what happens
if you tell mom and dad sam
youll put ariel in the garbage disposal
goddamn right i will
so grody
hey cherita you want a cigarette
shut up
shut up
go back to china bitch
just leave her alone
thats some good shit huh
its a fucking cigarette
there would be headlines
in the papers
the grownup gangs who ran
the betting at the wrestling
and the barrowboys
would hear with respect
of how old miserys house
had been destroyed
it was as though this plan had
been with him all his life
pondered through the seasons
now in his 15th year
crystallised with the
pain of puberty
what is graham greene trying
to communicate with this passage
why did the children
break into old miserys house
joanie
they wanted to rob him
if you had actually
read the short story
which was a whopping 13 pages
youd know that the children
find a great deal of money
in the mattress but burn it
donnie darko perhaps with your
recent brush with mass destruction
you can give us your opinion
they say it when they flood the
house when they tear it to shreds
that destruction
is a form of creation
so burning the money is ironic
they just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart
they want to change things
may we help you
yeah i just registered
they put me in the wrong class
you look like you belong here
um  where do i sit
sit next to the boy
you think is the cutest
quiet
let her choose
joanie get up
what people dont understand
is that dukakis
does not have
the financial infrastructure
well the construction guys
say it will take about a week
to fix the roof
airline better not fuck us
on the shingle match
they still dont know
know what
where it came from
oh no they cant tell us
something about a matching
serial number that got burned
i had to sign a form saying i
wouldnt talk to anyone about it
so we cant tell anyone
what nobody knows
yeah but you tell
whats your doctors name
dr thurman dad
yes tell dr thurman whatever you want
dad
what
dad
oh
whats that woman doing
in the middle of the damn road
no mail today maybe tomorrow
what did she say to you
i made a new friend
real or imaginary
imaginary
would you like to talk about this friend
frank
frank
what did he say
he said to follow him
follow him where
into the future
and then what happens
and then he said
then he said that the world
was coming to an end
do you think
the world is coming to an end
no
thats stupid
for my entire life
i was a victim of my own fear
love
i was feeding fear with food
fear
finally i looked in the mirror
not just in the mirror
i looked through the mirror
in that image
i saw my ego reflection
for two years
i thought it was normal
for a 10yearold to wet the bed
shh quiet
but the solution
was there all the time
im not afraid any more
all over america people have
come together to join hands
people who believe that human life
is absolutely too important
too valuable and too precious
to be controlled by fear
pay close attention
you could miss something
hello my name is jim cunningham
and welcome to controlling fear
and the prince
was led into a world
of strange and beautiful magic
wow
the last unicorn
by samantha darko

donnie darko  what the hell kind

its like a superhero or something
what makes you think im not
i should go for physics monnitoff
is having me write this essay
the greatest invention
ever to benefit mankind
its monnitoff
but thats easy antiseptics
like the whole sanitation thing
joseph lister 1895
before antiseptics there was no
sanitation especially in medicine
you mean soap
well im really glad
school was flooded today
why is that
wed never have had
this conversation
youre weird
sorry
no that was a compliment
well look uh
you want to go with me
where do you want to go
no i mean like go with me
you know like going together
sure
ok where are you going
im going home
stupid  where are you going
id like to try something new
have you ever been hypnotised
no
when i clap twice you will

yes
so tell me about your week
i met a girl
what is her name
gretchen
were going together now
do you still think
about girls a lot
yeah
how are things going at school
i think about girls a lot
i asked you about school donnie
i think about fucking
a lot during school
what else do you think about
during school
married with children
you think about your family
i just turn down the volume
and think about fucking
christina applegate
i asked you about your family
no
i dont think about fucking
my family thats gross
id like to hear
about your friend frank
sam bylan
cherita chen
donald darko
daye dennis
hey you fuck
did you say i flooded the school
i didnt say shit
yeah well they think i did it
if youre innocent then you have
nothing to worry about right
fuck you you know what i think
i think you did it
beer and pussy  thats all i need
we gotta find ourselves a smurfette
smurfette
mmhm
not some tightass middlesex chick
like this cute little blonde
thatll get down with the guys
like smurfette does
smurfette doesnt fuck
thats bullshit why do you think
papa smurf made her
because the other smurfs
were getting too horny
not vanity
i heard he was a homosexual
then she fucks them
while vanity watches
what about papa smurf
he must get some action
what he does
he films the gangbang
later on he beats off to the tape
first of all papa smurf didnt
create smurfette gargamel did
she was sent as gargamels evil spy
to destroy the smurf village
but the overwhelming goodness
of the smurfs transformed her
and as for the whole gangbang
scenario it just couldnt happen
smurfs are asexual
they dont even have
reproductive organs
under those little white pants
thats whats so illogical
about being a smurf
whats the point of living
if you dont have a dick
donnie why you gotta get
smart on us
grandma death
excuse me excuse me
stay off the road miss sparrow
or i will call social services
i hate that miss farmer
shes such a fucking bitch
yeah
how old is grandma death
101
she does the same thing every day
just walks back and forth
and back and forth to the mailbox
nothing ever in there
oh wait wait wait
shes going back to the box
we may still have mail
mail mail mail
here it is
this could be it oh
oh no dice grandma sorry
someone ought to write that bitch
authorities continued
their search
for a suspect in the middlesex
ridge school vandalism
the private school
has asked for donations
to restore its beloved mascot
known only as the mongrel
its very helpful
theres a good turnout tonight
what are you trying
to accomplish here
there was urine and faeces
flooded in my office
whatever fits
whatever fits
in cooperation
with the county police
we have begun
an active investigation
into the cause of the flooding
and our suspects include
several of our own students
i want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children
kitty i would appreciate
if you would wait
dr cole not only am i a teacher
but i am also a parent
of a middlesex child
therefore i am the
only person here
who transcends
the parentteacher bridge
dont worry you got away with it
i have in my hand graham greenes
the destructors
this short story is part of my
daughters english assignment
in this story
several children destroy
an elderly mans house
from inside out
how can you do that
and how do they do this
they flood the house
by breaking through a water main
i can do anything i want
and so can you
and i think that this garbage
should be removed
excuse me
what is the real issue here
the pta doesnt ban books
the pta must acknowledge
that pornography
is being taught in our curriculum
its meant to be ironic
excuse me go back to grad school
why did you make me
flood the school
they are in great danger
do you even know
who graham greene is
i think we have all seen bonanza
well um  while we are
on other topics
where do you come from
do you believe in time travel
who are you talking to
i was just taking my pills sam
a storm is coming frank says
a storm that will swallow
the children
and i will deliver them
from the kingdom of pain
ill deliver them
back to their doorsteps
send the monsters
back to the underground
ill send them back to a place
where no one else can see them
except for me
because i am donnie darko
who is frank
a sixfoottall bunny rabbit
in these modern times
our attitude and beliefs
are so delicate so fragile
i have had a cunning vision
this vision has released me
its important that
our lifeline be rejuvenated
so that we can breathe again
its time to breathe
it is time to breathe
thank you jim cunningham
thank you jim cunningham
so now let us begin lifeline
exercise number one
please press stop now
as you can see the lifeline is
divided into two polar extremes
fear and love
fear is in the negative
energy spectrum
love is in the positive energy spectrum
no duh
excuse me
no duh is a product of fear
now on each card
is a character dilemma
which applies to the lifeline
please  take this thank you
please read each character
dilemma aloud
and place an x on the lifeline
in the appropriate place
cherita
juanita has an important
math test today
shes known about the test for
several weeks but has not studied
in order to keep from failing
juanita decides
to cheat on the math test
good good very good
mr darko
lingling finds a wallet
filled with money
she takes it to the address
on the drivers licence
but keeps the money
im sorry miss farmer
i dont get this
just place an x
in the appropriate place
i know what to do but you cant
lump things into two categories
the lifeline is divided that way
well life isnt that simple
i mean
who cares if lingling
keeps the money
it has nothing to do
with fear or love
they are the deepest
human emotions
ok but youre not listening to me
there are other things
to take into account
the whole spectrum
of human emotion
you cant just lump everything
into two categories
and deny everything else
if you dont complete the
assignment youll get a zero
donald let me preface
this by saying
that your iowa test scores
are  intimidating
so
lets go over this again
what exactly
did you say to miss farmer
ill tell you he asked me
to forcibly insert the lifeline
exercise card into my anus
nobody cares about responsibility
morality family values
kitty  excuse us please
theyve suspended him from
after school activities for 6 months
since this jet engine fiasco
i dont know whats gotten into
ill say this because our daughters
are on the dance team together
and i respect you
but after witnessing
your sons behaviour
i have significant doubts
about your
our paths through life
must be righteous
go home and look in the mirror
and pray that your son doesnt
succumb to the path of fear
do you remember
that weird gym teacher mrs farmer
yeah ok well my brother told her
to shove a book up her ass today
and then my parents
just bought him all this new shit
yeah i know i wish a jet engine
would fall on my room
dr monnitoff
donnie
i know this is gonna
sound kind of weird
but do you know anything
about  time travel
a wormhole with an
einsteinrosen bridge
which is theoretically a wormhole
in space controlled by man
so according to hawking
a wormhole may be able
to provide a short cut
for jumping between two distant
regions of spacetime
so to travel back in time
you have to have a spaceship
faster than the speed of light
theoretically
and be able to find a wormhole
the basic principles of
time travel are there
your vessel and portal
your vessel can be anything
like a delorean
metal craft of any kind
you know i love that movie its
so  like futuristic you know
listen um  dont tell anybody
that i gave you this
woman who wrote this
used to teach here
she was a nun long before that
then overnight she became
this entirely different person
she up and left the church
wrote this book
she started teaching science
right here at middlesex
the philosophy of time travel
roberta sparrow
thats right
roberta sparrow
roberta sparrow
grandma death
its called
the philosophy of time travel
what does philosophy have to do with it
guess who wrote it
who
roberta sparrow
huh she wrote a book
grandma death wrote a book
thats a terrible nickname
we almost ran her down
the other day
she lives in that piece of crap
house and you know shes loaded
youre right
she was known for her gem collection
kids used to go up there
all the time
and try to steal stuff from her
she became a total recluse
i didnt know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down
she was just standing
in the road frozen
i walked over to see if she was ok
and she whispered in my ear
what did she say
i think frank wants me to talk to her
he asked if i knew
about time travel
she wrote a book about it
so that cant be
a coincidence right
what did she say to you
she said that every living creature
on earth dies alone
how did that make you feel
it reminded me of my dog callie
she died when i was eight and she
crawled underneath the  the porch
to die
to be alone
do you feel alone right now
i dont know
id like to believe im not
but i just
ive just never seen any proof
so i just dont debate it any more
i could spend my whole life
debating it over and over
and still wouldnt have proof
so i just dont debate it any more
its absurd
the search for god is absurd
it is if everyone dies alone
does that scare you
i dont want to be alone
and his tapes have
made me realise
that for the last 39 years i have
been a prisoner of my own fear
fear
you have got to meet
this jim cunningham
i cant believe hes single
it has been a disappointing night
for these super bowl champions
youre right dan coach joe gibbs
is on the sidelines
hes gotta be thinking what
happened what went wrong tonight
and heres the kick
oh
its no good
shit we need a quarterback
we need a miracle
we need to go for a safety
what the future holds for this mvp
well have to wait and see
you guys want anything
this week on whos the boss
samantha borrows tonys van
and gets caught without a licence
better make sure
we dont miss that one
here we are again
fourth down now
tomorrow we meet our partners
for the young inventors fair
what if you could go back in time
and take those hours of pain
and replace them
with something better
like images
yeah a hawaiian sunset
or the grand canyon
things that remind you
how beautiful
weve been going together
for two weeks
yeah
well i er  i
you want to kiss me
im sorry i
look donnie wait i just
well i like you a lot
i just want it to be
at a time when  it
when what
when it reminds me just
when it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be
yeah
and theres some fat guy
staring at us
i dont think telling any woman
to forcibly insert
an object up her anus
is something that should
go without consequence
i think we should buy him a moped
i think we should get a divorce
you wont tell mom will you
why would i
you tell mom everything
no i dont
let me see it
no its not finished its
ok its cool
thats scary
you think
thank you for seeing us
at such late notice
we both felt
we should come and discuss
what i think is going on
with your son
yes
um  well hes er
you know about his past and he
was suspended from school
for insulting his gym teacher
im not sure thats a good example
i think he had just cause
rose let me lay out
what i believe is happening here
donnies aggressive behaviour
his increased detachment
from reality
seem to stem from his inability to
cope with the forces in the world
that he perceives
to be threatening
has he ever told you about frank
frank
yes the giant bunny rabbit
the what
i dont recall
him ever having mentioned a rabbit
donnie is experiencing
what is commonly called
a daylight hallucination
this is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics
what can we do
i would like to do more hypnotherapy
and increase his medication
whatever will help him really
is  thats why were here
we just would like him
to experience some relief
so if you think that more
medication will do that
then i think
we should give it a try
its complicated
yeah
theres like a force in your brain
that just sends you someplace
do you go someplace familiar
no but each time i keep waking up
farther from my house
scary
donnie darko
i know
good morning you mongrels
good morning
is that all you can muster
good morning
good morning
now thats a tiny tiny bit better
but i still sense some students
who are actually afraid
to say good morning
good morning
yeah thats what i like to hear
too many young men and women today
are completely paralysed
by their fears
they surrender their bodies to the
temptation and destruction
of drugs alcohol
and premarital sex
now im going to tell you
a little story today
its a heartbreakingly sad story
about a young man
whose life was completely destroyed
by these instruments of fear
a young man searching for love
in all the wrong places
his name was frank
were moving through time
what
hi my stepsister like
i sometimes worry
that she eats too much
shut up kim
im just trying to help
oh sweetheart please
theres no reason
to be embarrassed here
many times we eat because we are
afraid to face our ego reflection
we find ourselves
looking at the mirror
rather than into
and through the mirror
when we do that we can finally
see how beautiful we are
thanks
sure come up here dont be afraid
er how can i find out what
i wanna be when i grow up
oh thats a hard one
well look deep inside of yourself
deep within your heart
and find what makes you feel love
pure unconditional love
and go to that in your studies
in your athletics
in your relationships
go towards love
thank you
come on up
next
how do i learn how to fight
how do i learn how to fight
son violence is a product of fear
learn to truly love yourself
truly love yourself
and the world will be yours
ok
get yourself up here
all right
good morning
good morning
um  how much are they
paying you to be here
er  excuse me
whats your name son
gerald
well gerald
i think youre afraid
do you want us to buy your book
because that was
the worst advice ever
see how sad this is
want your sister to lose weight
tell her to stop eating twinkies
and play field hockey
no one knows what they want to be
it takes time to find that out
right jim
and you
yeah you
sick of some jerk shoving
your head down the toilet
well lift some weights
or take a karate lesson and next
time kick him in the balls
son  see this this is an anger
prisoner a textbook example
prisoner
do you see the fear people
this boy is scared to death
son it breaks my heart
to say this
but i believe youre a very
troubled and confused young man
you are searching
in all the wrong places
youre right actually
i am pretty troubled
and pretty confused
and im afraid really really
afraid really afraid but i  i
i think youre
the fucking antichrist
its amazing
he thinks hes telling the truth
everything he says
is a fucking lie
everything he says
everyone thinks hes so rad
hes such a fucking chud
are you ok
sit down calm down
you ever hear of grandma death
who
the philosophy of time travel
what is this
she wrote it
im  im seeing stuff
like really messedup stuff
that book describes
stuff ive been seeing
and it cant just be a coincidence
she must be in
she never leaves this house
maybe shes asleep
donnie look
send her a letter
each vessel travel along a
vector through spacetime
along its centre of gravity
like a spear
pardon
like a spear coming out of your chest
um  sure yeah
in order for the vessel
to travel through time
its got to find a portal
a wormhole or
could these portals
could these portals
just appear anywhere any time
i think thats highly unlikely
no youre talking about
an act of god
if god controls time
time is predecided
im not following you
every living thing
follows a set path
and if you could see your path
then you could see the future
thats a form of time travel
well youre contradicting
yourself
if we were able
to see our destinies
manifest themselves visually
then we would be given a choice
to betray our destinies
the mere fact
that this choice exists
would make all preformed destiny
come to an end
not if you travel
within gods channel
im not going to be able
to continue this conversation
why
i could lose my job
ok
it gives me no pleasure
to deny you
one of the great writers
of the 20th century
alas i have not yet been elected
queen of the universe
so i must obey the rules
so anyone seen in this school
reading this book
will be suspended
not to worry
someone preordered a dozen copies
at the sarasota mall bookstore
in mr greenes absence
we will now be reading another
classic  watership down
here donnie
pass these back
maybe you and frank
can read this one together
now you know where he lives
and they grow
out of our  chest solar plexus
just like she described the way
they moved and they smelled
its like theyre workers
assigned to each one of us
they just  theyre like liquid
i followed it
into my parents bedroom
what did you find
nothing
so we call them imgs
infant memory generators
you buy these glasses
for your infant
and they wear them
at night when they sleep
but inside the glasses
are these slide photographs
each photograph is of something
peaceful or beautiful
whatever the parents want
what effect would it have
on an infant
well nobody remembers
their infancy
anybody who says they do is lying
so this will help develop
memory earlier in life
yeah
did you consider
that infants need darkness
as part of their natural
development
no
yeah
what if the parents put in pictures
of satan or dead people
is that what youd show your kids
er well i mean didnt your dad
like stab your mom
get out
gretchen
gretchen gretchen
im sorry about those guys
two for evil dead please
thatll be 2
why do you wear
that stupid bunny suit
why are you wearing
that stupid man suit
take it off
what happened to your eye
why do they call you frank
it is the name of my father
and his father before me
frank
wheres this going to stop
you should already know that
watch the movie screen
theres something
i want to show you

how you doing donnie
your little sister
was brokenhearted
that you missed
her big show last night
dad
hm
im crazy
youre not crazy
i used to be crazy
but youre not crazy
look youre my only son
i know
no hold it i know im not
the best communicator but
whatever happens to you
be honest tell the truth
even if they do look at you
funny  they will
but what you gotta understand son
is that almost all of those
people are full of shit
theyre all part of this great
big conspiracy of bullshit
and theyre scared
of people like you
because those bullshitters know
that youre smarter
than all of them
you know what you say
to people like that hm
fuck you
the blaze was extinguished
sometime after 800 last night
firefighters discovered
what has been referred to
as a kiddie porn dungeon
cunningham who has become a recent
celebrity was arrested
oh my god
while at sarasota heights country club
arson has not been ruled out
as the cause of the fire
now a group of
cunning vision employees
dad played golf with that guy
vehemently denied
the alleged link
to a child pornography
publishing circuit
in a vicious statement connie
attacked fire department officials
claiming a mass conspiracy
im sorry karen
this is a progressive school
but we dont feel
your methods are appropriate
what exactly about my methods
are inappropriate
i am sorry that you have failed
now if youll excuse me
i have another appointment
you can finish out the week
fuck
good afternoon its a great
pleasure to announce
that the middlesex ridge school
dance team
has been invited to perform on
star search 88 in los angeles
i know now a terrible thing is coming
what do you mean
the field the field
its covered with blood
blood dont be silly
all right its getting dark
we should get back to the burrow
back to the burrow itll come
there its all around us
stop it fiver
weve got to leave here
when the other rabbits
hear of fivers vision
do they believe him
why should we care
because the rabbits are us donnie
why should i mourn for a rabbit
is the death of one species
less tragic than another
of course a rabbits not like us
it has no history books
no photographs
no knowledge of sorrow or regret
im sorry dont get me wrong
i like rabbits
theyre cute and horny
if youre cute and horny
youre happy
you dont know why youre alive
you just want to have sex as many
times as possible before you die
i just dont see the point
in crying over a dead rabbit
who never even feared death
to begin with
youre wrong
these rabbits are the product
of the authors imagination
he cares for them
so we care for them
otherwise weve just
missed the point
arent we forgetting
about the miracle of storytelling
the deus ex machina
the god machine
thats what saved the rabbits
no it was ridiculous
ill call you back
rose
kitty
im sure youve heard the horrible
allegations against jim cunningham
i know something about
a kiddie porn dungeon
oh please please
dont use those words
its obviously a conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man
im spearheading the jim cunningham
defence campaign
rose i have to appear at his
arraignment tomorrow morning
the girls have to leave
for los angeles
as their coach i was the obvious
choice to chaperone them
but now you cant go

of all the other mothers
i would never dream of asking you
but none of the others
are available
i dont know kitty its a bad
weekend eddies in new york
rose i dont know
if you realise
what an opportunity
this is for our daughters
this has been a dream of samanthas
and all of ours for a long time
i made her lead dancer
sometimes i doubt your commitment
to sparkle motion
elizabeth will be in charge
shell drive you to therapy
and if you need anything
you promise me
that you will call dr thurman
how does it feel
to have a wacko for a son

the skys gonna open up
if the sky suddenly opened up
there would be no law no rule
there would only be you
and your memories
the choices youve made
and the people youve touched
if this world were to end
there would only be you and him
and no one else
you can stop
taking your medication
theyre placebos
just pills made out of water
thank you
donnie
an atheist is someone who denies
altogether the existence of god
youre an agnostic
an agnostic is someone
who believes that there is
no proof of the existence of god
but does not deny
a possibility that god exists
