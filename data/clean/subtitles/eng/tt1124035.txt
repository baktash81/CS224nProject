i m not muslim 
my religion and
what i believe in
is called the constitution
of the united states of america 
  hang on 
  did you get that 
  and let me open these up 
  hmm 
okay  go ahead 
if i m not religious enough for you 
don t vote for me 
if i m not experienced
enough for you   
don t vote for me 
uh   
you know what  don t vote for me 
don t  don t do it 
whatever you do 
don t vote for me  how s that 
  okay 
  okay  we got it  thanks 
can we get the monitors up a little 
i d like the governor to
be able to hear himself 
  you got it 
  okay 
also    are we gonna put risers
under these podiums
like we discussed
in the preconditions 
no  i know  we didn t get
the specs till last night 
they re making something
slide right under that 
okay  thank you 
it s just they re few inches short 
so it makes it hard for him
  to read his notes 
  okay 
gentlemen  thank you 
and i see you in a few hours 
didn t know the governor
had trouble reading his notes 
why he isn t wearing glasses 
no  he doesn t  just pullman is 5 8  
he s gonna look like a hobbit 
i like mike  i like mike 
well  it all comes down to this 
we are one week away
from the ohio primary 
two democrats on left standing 
senator pullman of arkansas
trailing governor morris
of pennsylvania 
governor morris has mounted
a sizable lead  with 2047 delegates 
winning new hampshire  california 
new york and michigan 
but senator pullman  with 1302
delegates  is still in the hunt 
having won florida and tennessee
and virginia and missouri 
a win in ohio could turn it all
around for the arkansas senator 
one week from tuesday 
the all important 161 ohio delegates
could be the deciding factor 
once again  it is true 
as goes ohio  so goes the nation 
would you call yourself christian 
how would that matter 
let me quote  i have no idea
what happens when we die 
maybe nothing  maybe it s like
before we were born  unquote 
  you did write this governor 
  let me be specific 
please do 
i was raised catholic 
i am not a practicing catholic 
and i have no idea what
happens after we die 
if the senator does 
maybe he should be president 
i ll vote for him 
is that your idea of being specific 
  let me be more specific 
  thank you 
i am not a christian or an atheist 
i m not jewish or muslim 
what i believe  my religion 
is written on a piece of paper
called the constitution 
meaning that i will defend 
until my dying breath  your right
to worship  in whatever
god you believe in 
as long as it doesn t hurt others 
i believe we should be judged as a country
by how we take care of the people
who cannot take care of themselves 
that s my religion 
if you think i m not religious enough 
don t vote for me 
if you think i m not experienced enough 
or tall enough  don t vote for me 
because i can t change
that to get elected 
i just wanted you to say out loud
if you believe in the teaches of the bible 
is this a democratic primary
or a general election 
well governor  whoever wins this
contest will be running for president 
and if you think that
these questions won t be central
in a general election 
then you are living in fantasy land 
i m simply pointing to the obvious 
we are running for president
of the united states 
not student council president 
  double 
  yeah  double 
fucking national security 
  out of the park 
  home run 
the alumni of miami
university of ohio
would like to thank you for
attending tonight s debate
and ask you to please remain in your seats
until the candidates have left the stage 
thank you very much 
you know  i m trying to
remember if the democrats
have ever nominated
an atheist before 
well  we know they ve
nominated a jackass before 
oh  must have been you
that did that prep work  stephen 
paul s not that clever 
you ve always had the brain  stuff 
but me  i ve had the balls 
well  it looks like you ve
got some brains now too 
be careful  i just might
have to steal him from you 
hm 
what a prick 
  we ll meet again  
  don t know where
don t know when  
  but i know we ll meet again  
  some sunny day  oh   
so paul  tell me something i don t know 
tell me what s going
to happen on the 15th 
  oh  god 
  what 
  what do you think  stevie 
  i think it s ours for the taking  you 
  yeah  ben 
  yeah  we ll win 
  what do you think  ida 
  i m asking you 
oh  you tell me  i ll tell you 
if i had to say  i d say it ll be close 
but you ll eke it out 
eke 
you see 
she s trying to get under my skin 
  so  what s gonna happen 
  us by nine 
so you re certain
you re gonna win here 
  certain  no  confident  yeah 
  you just said you ll win by nine 
and i think that we will  i m not
gonna tell you it s a sure thing 
if the fucking saint gabriel can
blow his horn on election day
and get his four horsemen
to rig the ballot boxes for pullman 
and it wouldn t surprise me 
six presidentials i ve done
and i ve never felt this good 
but i m not gonna sit here and say 
 yeah  hey  we ll win ohio  
not a chance 
in the last 30 years 
73 democrats have run for president 
how many have won  three 
that means 70 guys ran who thought
they had a chance  and they all lost 
so you re saying there s
a big chance you won t win 
don t twist my words ida 
what i m saying is i m not
gonna promise you we ll win 
but he s a decorated of bush junior from
the first gulf war  he protested the second 
he left his state with a balanced budget
and the fourth highest education rate 
the republicans  have no one
out there that can touch this guy 
for this moment  this election 
this primary  is the presidential 
and that  ida 
is the state of the union 
and on that note   
i m gonna take a shit 
  so  stephen 
  so  ida 
  stephen  stephen  stephen 
  ida  ida  ida 
  paul s going to the airport 
  yeah 
  he s getting on a plane 
  that s what you do going at airport  yeah 
where s that plane going 
okay 
  i ll give you three guesses 
  he s not going back to headquarters 
  correct 
  he s not going to texas 
no need  we re gonna split texas 
so it s a wash 
what if i said north carolina 
  is that your guess 
  he s going to north carolina 
  i can neither confirm nor deny that 
  i knew it  now tell me why 
  i cannot do that 
  ugh  i hate you 
  you love me 
  i love paul  you  i hate 
you love him because
he gives you the scoops 
  sexual favors 
  you re engaged 
if it meant a good scoop 
my fiance would understand 
you really buy
into all this crap 
all this  take back the country  nonsense 
ida  i m not naive  okay 
i ve worked on more campaigns
than most people have
by the time they re 40 
i m telling you  this is the one 
  you really have drunk the kool aid 
  i have drunk it  it s delicious 
look  i don t care if he happens
to be leading in the polls
and i don t care if he happens
to have all the right tools 
the truth is  he s the only one
that s gonna actually make a
difference in the people s lives 
even the people that hate him 
if mike morris is president 
it says more about us
than it does about him 
i don t give a fuck  if he can win 
he has to win 
or what  what 
the world s gonna fall apart 
it won t matter  not one bit 
to the everyday lives
or the everyday fuckers
who get up  and work 
and eat  and sleep 
go back to work again 
you know  if your boy wins 
you get a job in the white house 
he loses  you re back at a
consulting firm on the k street 
that s it 
you used to know that
before you got all
goosebumpy about this guy 
mike morris is a politician 
he s a nice guy 
they re all nice guys 
he will let you down 
sooner or later 
   scuse me  
  while i  
  disappear   
  this is off off off the record 
  what 
  franklin thompson 
  seriously 
off the record  the only people who know
are the governor  stephen and me 
my lips are sealed 
tomorrow i have a meeting
at thompson s house 
  he s going to endorse 
  after i m done talking to him 
that s huge 
more than huge 
he has 356 pledged delegates 
they all travel with him 
puts us over the top 
he said publicly he s not
going to endorse anybody 
yeah well  that s what they all say
untill you get them alone in a room 
  so this is for real 
  yep 
just about in the bag 
when are you
going to announce 
nope  that s all
you get for now 
okay  listen up 
these are your new cell phones 
shelly s pre programmed
your numbers  thank you shelly 
no personal calls  kevin 
if you lose them 
the dnc will come to your house 
  new phones  give me your old one 
  i ll give you later 
i gotta believe we can do it 
we have enemies  we have to understand
why our enemies are our enemies
and see if there s something we can
do about that  besides just using force 
as we know from history 
the answer to extremism
can t be extremism 
fucking kill me 
whoever throws their hat in 
  whoever decides   
  where did we get this 
some town hall meeting
in pennsylvania before the announce 
thank god it wasn t overseas 
just get rid of it 
hey  what i mean  if it plays to his base 
  why would this bother us 
  are you fucking stoned 
this is the exact same piece the republicans
are gonna run against him in the general 
we don t need to brag about it 
i m neville chamberlain 
i d like to be your commander in chief 
then if it s gonna come out anyway   
then it s gonna come out  but it s not
gonna come out paid for by us  pal 
you think there s any truth
in this pullman having investments
in a diamond mine in liberia 
still checking on it  but we got
it from a blog  so who the fuck   
i don t care if it s true 
i just wanna hear him denying it 
if it is true  great  find out 
but if not  let them spend
the day telling the post
that he doesn t own
a diamond mine in liberia 
  win win 
  okay 
we gotta counter this christian shit
  we take him from last night
  got it 
i need the new 30
and 60 second spots 
we can show him in the
staff meeting this afternoon  so   
  hey 
  hey 
ben wanted me to get you to sign off
on this before the staff meeting 
okay  thank you 
i ve been waiting for this 
anything interesting 
this is some white paper
i have to hand out tonight 
what s white paper 
negative shit 
our oppo guys do research 
we feed it to the press 
and we see what sticks 
what kind of negative shit 
  you ll read the paper tomorrow 
  which paper 
  any  any paper 
  so it s something big 
i wish it was something bigger 
it s just these
transportation numbers 
i m gonna have to spin
pretty hard to make it stick 
  that s what you re good at  right 
  i guess 
tell him it s fine 
  did you get your new phone 
  mm hm 
it s really exciting  isn t it 
what are you  a bearcat 
am i a what 
cincinnati bearcat 
oh  no  i m not from here 
i worked with you in iowa  actually 
oh 
that s right 
but you changed something 
  my hair 
  you changed your hair 
no 
oh  i see 
bet you i look like a real
dumb ass right now  huh 
no  not at all 
you re the big man on campus 
i m just a lowly intern 
oh  it s not like that 
you get to stay at the millennium 
ok  they put us in a motel
in the other side of the river 
  you re right  i am the big man on campus 
  now you re starting to see 
mm hm 
  we do have a better bar  though 
  i ve heard that 
you should come by one night 
have a drink with the worker bees 
i might do that  i might do that 
what s a good night 
  tonight s good 
  tonight  tuesday night 
  yeah  it s quiet 
  quiet s good 
well  you have my number 
i do 
it s programmed right
there in your phone 
aha 
  under  mary  
  i know your name s mary 
my name is molly 
yep 
that s what i m hearing 
since super tuesday  all of a sudden 
i m a very popular guy 
what are your
polls telling you 
that pullman s negatives
are high  mid 40s 
senator  we have an open
seat in the white house 
the republicans have dick 
they re disorganized 
they can t find a nominee
that s not a world class fuck up 
they look like democrats 
no republican s gonna
show up to vote for their guy 
but if pullman gets the democratic nod 
they will show up to vote against him 
and you think they won t for your guy 
you think morris gets the independents 
i sure do 
senator  i m a bit confused 
we need your delegates 
we need you 
your fund raising 
and i guess
it was my understanding
that your endorsement
a week before ohio
would win this for us 
  thank you 
  estella 
hand me that ice bucket 
  is this paul  or is this you 
  paul knows and paul agrees 
ben  where s my op ed piece
on national service 
  it s easier for me to work off of that 
  got it right here 
give me a hard copy 
  i hate those fucking things 
  can we print it out 
  molly  can you grab it a print for me 
  yeah  one second 
  so if you wanna change or refresh   
  just give me a second  will you 
your national service isn t polling
the same as the rest of your policy 
i don t give a shit about
the polling  stephen 
i m not gonna play this game with you 
this is your good cop 
bad cop act with paul 
good cop  good cop 
i m not changing it 
here we go 
all right  let s see 
it says we re gonna help
people get an education 
we re gonna create national unity 
we re gonna teach young people a trade 
and we re gonna to get them out
of debt for their college loans 
  now  where does that fail 
  all of that s exactly right  governor 
just  if you re gonna do it  do it 
make it mandatory  not voluntary 
  now  that ll poll well 
  mandatory 
everybody who turns 18
or graduates high school
gives two years of service
to his or her country 
it can be in the military  peace corps 
planting fucking trees  i don t care 
for that  your college
education is paid for  period 
we do all of that right here 
no  sir  you don t  not all the way 
do it all the way  mandatory 
  paul likes this 
  mm hm 
you re my brain trust 
the beauty of it is that everybody
who s over the age of 18
or pass the age of
eligibility will be for it 
  why not 
  and all of the others   
can t vote 
too young 
too bad 
you can t lose 
  uh  stephen 
  mm 
you have a call on line 3 
it s your dad 
okay 
you and ben work it
on this stump speech 
and you ll get me a hard copy
and i ll write it in my own words 
  don t forget you have charlie rose at 6 
  right  yeah  why am i doing him 
it s long form 
he s flying in 
paul going 
paul won t be in 
but ben and i will take you 
just don t tell me someone s died 
hey  steve 
  who is this 
  tom duffy 
sorry about the dad bit 
uh    i just figured you wouldn t
want my name called out
at a morris campaign office 
  what do you want 
  you got a couple minutes 
  i d like to sit down with you 
  what for 
well  i think it s important 
well  if it s important  don t you think
you should be calling paul 
i m calling you 
this is on the up and up 
steve  give me five minutes 
  i can t be talking to you 
  i hear you 
but  if you got five minutes 
i m gonna be at the head first sport bar
  for the next couple of hours 
  i can t  tom 
there won t be anybody there 
okay 
you get a chance 
there s something i wanna show you 
paul  call me back  it s important 
you re working for the wrong man 
you are working for the wrong man 
oh  on the contrary  you are the
one working for the wrong man 
and you got something
the other guys don t have 
  yeah 
  yeah  what is it exactly 
 charm  is not
the right word 
  it is the right word 
  no  it s more than that 
you exude something 
you draw people in 
all the reporters love you 
even the ones that hate you love you 
 cause you play them like the pieces on
a chessboard and make it look effortless 
and we both know
how hard it is
constantly being on guard 
weighing every word  every move 
but from the outside 
you make it look easy 
people are scared of you 
 cause they don t understand how
you do it  and they love you for it 
and that is the most
valuable thing in this business 
the ability to win
people s respect
by making them mistake
their fear for love 
you can guess what
i m gonna say next 
  i don t think that i can 
  i want you to work for us 
  what  are you kidding 
  no  not in the least 
  you re gonna lose ohio 
  i am not 
oh  you re sitting on about
a six percent lead in both polls 
six percent of
all democrats polled 
  eight 
  no  six  doesn t matter 
ohio is an open primary  right 
independents and republicans get
the vote on the democratic candidate 
do you think they like your guy 
  a pro choice tax and spend liberal 
  no  fuck  no  no  they hate him 
they think they can beat my guy 
but they re very worried about yours 
so starting tomorrow morning 
you re gonna see a fucking blitz 
limbaugh  hannity 
all those right wing blogs
are starting a
get out the vote campaign 
it s started already 
every fuckin  conservative in ohio
is gonna line up around the block
to punch my guy s ticket 
and that s just one step 
ohio s gone 
polls don t mean shit 
tomorrow morning
everybody s gonna know 
and that s why i want you to handle
the fallout that we ll have in the press 
oh  and we got thompson
in the bag too 
i know for a fact that
you don t have thompson 
no  we promised him
secretary of state 
ohio is over 
it has been over for weeks 
and now with thompson s
delegates  huh 
i m thinking down the road here  man 
that is why i want you 
  i can t do it 
  bring you straight at the top 
  i can t do it 
  all right 
i don t need an answer
right this moment 
  look  i ve played dirty  all right 
  i m sorry to hear it 
but i don t have to play dirty anymore 
you know why  i got morris 
no  no  none of this is about
the democratic process  steve 
  it s about getting your guy off 
  this is the shit republicans pull 
yeah  you know what 
this is the kind of shit
that the republicans pull
and it s about time we learned from them 
they re meaner  they re tougher 
they re more disciplined than we are 
i ve been in this business 25 years 
and i ve seen way too
many democrats bite the dust
because they wouldn t get down in
the mud with the fucking elephants 
  paul s my friend 
  you wanna work for the friend
or do you wanna work
for the president 
think about it 
you got my number 
paul 
hey  they don t make
quaaludes anymore  do they 
not that i m aware of 
what s going on with thompson 
uh  he wants something  but   
we ll be fine 
what was so important 
nothing  figured it out 
all right 
i ll be on my cell if you need me 
i fly to d c  tomorrow 
back tomorrow night 
okay  i ll work on the quaaludes 
good man 
check the blogs and see if there s
any chatter  would you 
  chatter  what kind of chatter 
  i don t know 
  just see what they re talking about 
  stevie  you still single 
i m married to the campaign  governor 
he s married to the campaign 
good answer 
wall street journal
has our numbers holding 
  pullman dropped a point 
  really  when did they do that 
checking now 
governor  the wall street journal  numbers
are running pullman s down a point 
uh    we re moving
in the right direction 
ben  are you still single 
  married to the campaign  governor 
  crack team 
make sure charlie rose has
those numbers before he goes on 
i m on it 
get a copy of the show
before we leave too 
is it a difficult decision 
i have to believe it is 
would i do it  no 
but i can t see myself
or anyone
certainly not a government  telling a
woman what she should do with her body 
so  you would appoint a judge 
i would consider it arrogant to judge
anyone until i ve walked in their shoes 
  but you re against the death penalty 
  mmhmm 
because of what it says
about us as a society 
suppose  governor 
it was your wife 
and she was murdered 
what would i do 
it gets more complicated
when it s personal 
sure 
well  if i could get to him 
uh  i would find a way to kill him 
so you  you  governor 
would impose a death penalty 
no  i would commit a crime
for which i would happily go to jail 
then why not let
society do that 
because society has to be
better than the individual 
if i were to do that 
i would be wrong 
what about guns 
isn t it time for a commercial 
  this is public television 
  we don t have any commercials 
that s unfortunate 
where did you go after iowa 
california 
for super tuesday 
oh 
  i had to go to new york 
  i know 
you guys needed a lot
more help over there 
yeah 
so why politics 
because the pay
is so good  obviously 
it seems like a very odd fit 
my dad is jack stearns 
  oh  he s a good guy 
  he s an asshole 
but he s your boss 
he s not my boss 
he s the head of the dnc 
you don t work for the
democratic national committee 
i work for paul 
paul works for morris 
and if morris wins 
he s gonna be your dad s boss 
don t tell my dad that 
don t tell your dad
a lot of things 
never 
what time you gotta
work tomorrow 
nine a m 
i m showing the new
interns how to robocall 
it s because i m the
experienced intern  you see 
i see 
how old are you 
how old do you think i am 
thirty 
  you think i m 30 
  sorry  how old are you 
thirty 
how old are you 
how old do you think i am 
twenty one 
  twenty 
  yep 
that s young 
is that too young
to fuck a 30 year old 
well   
you see  the laws are
different in different states 
here  at your hotel here in
kentucky  it s frowned upon 
oh 
but  if we go across
the bridge into ohio
  where your hotel is 
  yeah  surprisingly 
they re very lax about their
child endangerment laws 
  do you have a car  i don t drive 
  i took a cab 
i have the keys
to the campaign bus 
it fairness this has been tried before 
operation chaos 
as russ limbaugh called it 
where republicans voted for a democrat 
they thought they could
beat in the general election 
we asked senator pullman s
campaign manager
if he s happy getting the
votes of right wingers 
is it decisive  no  of course not 
but look  we believe the polls
are within the margin of error
and that the senator
will win ohio 
yeah  what time s paul get in 
shit  who do we talk
to about polling 
i gotta get some internal polling on the
independents and the fucking wing nuts 
do you want me to go 
what s that guy s name
from the wall street journal 
you sound busy  i should go 
could you hold on a second 
i d like to talk to you about something 
adler  yeah  get him on the line 
nobody  the cleaning lady 
get him on the line 
tell him we re gonna take the
same position we ve always said 
the race is a lot closer than the polling 
no  don t say that  don t 
just get him on the line and call me 
i ll take care of it  i m sorry 
  cleaning lady 
  yeah 
you called me
the cleaning lady 
you re not mad
about that  are you 
  no  why would i be mad 
  right 
i spoke with jack stearns 
oh  hey  look 
i know you re looking for
a reaction  but listen 
we have two great candidates
in a very tight race 
and at the end of the day 
the voters will decide
who best can
represent this party 
i understand jack  but
doesn t this kind disruption
take away from what you guys
wanna be pushing this year 
you re right 
your dad is an asshole 
  i m gonna tell him you said that 
  yeah  do that 
you wanted to talk to me about something 
yeah  i just wanna be clear 
i don t want there to be any confusion 
i m not gonna tell
anybody about last night 
that d be great 
if we kept it between us 
  you know how people are 
  yeah 
really wouldn t look good
if you screwed an intern 
it s not like that 
it s not like i got drunk 
i like you 
i just don t want there
to be any expectations here 
  steve  you don t have to say anything 
  all right 
i just don t want you
to think i m a player 
you are kind of a player  but   
  i was being polite 
  bullshit 
  you were trying to pick me up 
  no  i wasn t 
you were pretty obvious about it 
  i was 
  yeah 
  i thought i was being smooth and subtle 
  no  you were pretty forward 
you were pretty forward
asking me to the bar 
well  been trying to fuck you for a while 
wow 
  it s kind of slutty of me  huh 
  not at all 
  i respect it in some strange way 
  good 
you absolutely have no idea
  how to tie a tie 
  no  no  not a clue 
you re very mature 
for a teenager 
when are you coming back 
i ll be at the event a little late 
these cocksuckers  fucking dirty shit 
  what happened with thompson 
  nothing  prick 
we had him all sewed up 
motherfucker 
how bad is it 
i don t know  i just   
i m running the numbers  paul 
all right  i ll   
i ll be there in three hours 
i want hard numbers
and a strategy 
yeah  i m on it  i gotta go 
  you okay 
  yeah  just trying to figure out our stops 
think the weather
might determine that 
if we get there 
we re gonna be fine 
we have to do it 
it s the right thing to do 
nothing bad happens when
you re doing the right thing 
is this your personal theory 
because i can shoot holes in it 
roberto clemente
on a humanitarian flight 
well  there s   
there s exceptions to every rule 
so how we doing 
  i think we re fine now 
  no  the campaign  how we doing 
oh  great 
stephen  you re not paul 
i pay paul to use the word  great  
i pay you to tell me the truth 
i think that we are solid 
okay paul 
governor  there s a big difference
between paul and me 
paul only believes in winning 
so he ll do or say anything to win 
but you wouldn t 
i ll do or say anything
if i believe in it 
but i have to believe in the cause 
you ll make a lousy consultant
when you re out of this line of work 
well  i won t be out of this line
of work as long as you re in it  sir 
so at best 
you got eight years 
then you end up at a nice
consultant firm off farragut north 
making 750 grand a year 
eating at the palm 
pimping out ex senators
to saudi princes 
pimping out ex presidents 
then i better win 
yeah 
now  i ve been married for 11 years 
we have a normal marriage 
which means when we disagree  she wins 
what we don t disagree on
is how we re gonna leave
this planet for our daughter 
are we gonna leave
it better off or worse 
the richest people in this country
don t pay their fair share 
and when they re asked to 
they cry socialism 
they use phrases like
 redistribution of wealth  
yeah 
that scares everybody 
and they all run and they hide 
for the record 
my campaign is vehemently
against the distribution of wealth
to the richest americans
by our government 
and i will run on that 
i didn t think it was true 
but i should ve told you 
  slow down 
  i m sorry 
i met with tom duffy yesterday 
what 
you were on a plane and he called
me and asked if we could meet 
i said   why   he said
it was very important  so i did 
  and i should have fucking told you 
  stop  stop  let me get this straight 
  you met with tom duffy 
  yeah 
what d he want  stephen 
the gist  he wants to hire me 
he wants me to jump ship
and come and work for him 
this is really fucking bad 
he told me they had poll numbers
that had pullman ahead by 4 
and we re in big fuckin  trouble 
 cause he laid out their strategy 
doing robocalls  traffic jams 
fake lit  and thompson 
they offered thompson
secretary of state 
you know how you fight
the war on terror 
you don t need their product anymore 
their product is oil 
just don t need it and they go away 
we don t have to bomb anyone 
we don t have to invade anyone 
if this is some kind of fucking practical   
i mean   
my fucking blood pressure s going
through the goddamn roof right now 
paul  i m sorry 
believe me 
  i just didn t think it was true 
  oh  it doesn t matter
what you fucking thought 
it matters what you did 
it matters what you didn t do 
  you re right 
  because if all this shit is true
i made a fucking ass out of
myself in thompson s place 
and i gave away our game plan 
please believe me 
i honestly believed you were gonna come back
and tell me we have
thompson in the bag 
i didn t see the point 
  it doesn t make it right  and i m sorry 
  let me think 
let me think 
if i m your president 
the first thing i d put into motion
is 10 years from
the day i take office 
no new car in america is run
on an internal combustion engine 
we will create hundreds
of thousands of new jobs 
we will start the next
technological revolution 
and we will lead the world again 
like we used to 
get the governor right after
he finishes singing  kumbaya 
and we give him
everything we know 
  who do you want 
  you  me and the governor  that s it 
  what s he have after 
  he has a fund raiser 
well  he ll be late 
we tell him if he doesn t offer
thompson the cabinet position 
he s not gonna get the nomination 
  is he gonna go for it 
  i don t fucking know  stephen 
find us a room 
how real are the numbers 
we might pick up a few points 
but we lose by 3 or 4 percent 
who fucking knows  governor 
but we can t take the chance 
what do you think 
i think we fold up the
campaign in ohio  take a loss 
blame it on republicans playing
games  head to north carolina 
i can t run from ohio  they ll kill us 
not if you get thompson s endorsement 
i m not gonna do it  what does he want 
head of the fda or something 
cabinet post 
  yeah  what  labor 
  state 
are you fuckin  kidding me 
i m gonna give secretary of state
to a guy who wants to cut
the top 10 floors off the u n  
paul  when we started this campaign 
i said i wasn t gonna
make those kind of deals 
governor  if you lose ohio and
they get thompson s delegates 
then they get north carolina 
then they get the lead 
a lead you can t beat 
if we walk from ohio 
take thompson 
give him the fuckin  cabinet post 
then we take north carolina 
his state 
then pennsylvania  your state 
and then it s simple math  mike 
take his endorsement
and the race is over 
paul  i respect you 
i respect your opinion 
i m never gonna do it 
so i suggest we find a
way for me to win ohio 
anything else 
  it s not gonna cut it 
  every car company in north of ohio 
they ve booked every single van for tuesday 
fuck  jess  i gotta call you back 
  all of them 
  all of them 
  you re killing me 
  here s what i got so far 
independents aren t biting 
but the republicans are 
they re not gonna tell a pollster
they re voting democratic 
  i can t find the goddamn polls 
  alright  i also made a call
and i m gonna get a hundred vans out of
convington and newport  kentucky 
  we don t need the fucking vans 
  no  no  that s not what i m saying 
  we don t want pullman to have the vans 
  we were the underdog before
we got into this 
we continue to be the underdog 
well  then   
yeah
we always knew the numbers were
gonna get closer as it get to tuesday 
we re not lowering expectations 
i mean  have i ever said to you
that we had ohio locked 
well then  at least  give me the courtesy
of printing that in your column 
what are you writing 
the greatest speech ever
given on hydrogen power 
the bar is set awfully
high on that one 
don t i know it 
i was hit up by mitchell s
wife for you to show up
at her daughters of the
american revolution luncheon 
who s mitchell 
congressman from
the first district 
you might wanna
remember that 
fucking congressman 
could you imagine doing
this every two years 
no  i can t 
let s just do it one more time 
mm hm 
  in four more years 
  that s it 
it s a deal 
do you think we ll lose ohio 
i don t know 
if you took thompson s delegates 
the race would be over 
ohio wouldn t matter 
is paul working on you 
stephen 
  they are good 
  mm 
  is thompson so bad 
  he s a shit 
  is he worse than pullman 
  yes  stephen 
every time i draw a line in the
sand and then i    i move it 
fundraisers  union deals 
i wasn t gonna do any of it 
negative ads 
i can t on this one 
not thompson 
tell mrs  mitchell i ll make
her goddamn luncheon 
let the old ladies
pat me on the head 
  you ve got great hair 
  you too  baby 
  gay marriage 
  it s a silly argument 
  not to a 50 percent of americans 
  over the age of 50 
that s who votes  that s
who shows up at the polls 
well  that s changing  hopefully 
the way we frame the argument is as well 
  from a religious    
  from a religious to a civil rights issue 
but one could argue a great
difference between gender and race 
not really  we used to ban interracial
marriages  women couldn t vote 
paul  i have the guy from
proctor   gamble 
  keep an eye on the governor 
  okay 
  i gotta know what s going on 
  yeah  yeah  okay 
all right  wait  wait  wait 
she s got a point to make  go ahead 
the argument is that men and women can
in fact be considered separate but equal 
  races cannot 
  how so 
you have separate public bathrooms
for both men and women 
but it would be illegal to have
separate bathrooms for two races 
  now 
  yes  now 
that s what i m saying 
see  we re framing the argument   
  what time is this thing airing 
  nine o clock 
  how d we do 
  we did good 
yes  i know  but i tried to reach him 
and i couldn t get through 
yeah  just e mail it to me 
  yeah 
  then i can give it to him 
oh  good  so attach that
and send it as an e mail to me 
yeah  i missed
my opportunity there 
  now 
  yes  now 
we re framing the
argument on the idea
that you choose to be gay 
not that you were born that way 
like being born african american 
if you start the
discussion with the idea
that gay is not a life choice
but is actually part of your dna 
then gay marriage can and
must only be a civil rights issue 
that s what i believe 
that s where i stand 
do you think your
candor is your appeal 
sorry 
fuck  it s not you 
  molly 
  hello 
hey  your phone rang 
  hm 
  your phone rang 
it did 
who s calling you

he just reached behind me
and closed the door 
jesus fucking christ

  no one knows 
  does anybody see 
  no 
  how could you know 
  i know 
then why is he calling

  okay  what 
  you met with duffy 
  who told you that 
  a little bird 
  who 
  did you meet with him 
where are you 
i know you met him with
at a little bar in cincy
just before the press conference 
  duffy ordered buffalo wings 
  who said that  duffy 
anonymous 
what happened with duffy 
ida  you re supposed to be my friend 
why you wanna stick the fuckin  knife
  in me on a bullshit story 
  well  is that what you thought 
that we re friends 
i ve given you everything you ever wanted 
everything  every story  every scoop 
the entire profile on paul 
you ve given me a lot 
but let s get real here steve 
the only reason you ve treated me
well was that i work for the times 
not because i m your friend 
you give me what i want 
i write you better stories 
don t pretend it s anymore than that 
why d you meet with duffy 
go fuck yourself 
okay  i ll make it easier on you 
forget duffy 
what happened at paul
and thompson s meeting 
keep your voice down 
do you have any idea
what this could do to me 
of course i do  that s why
i m giving you a choice here 
i could get fired 
so it s not a difficult one  is it 
i ve gotta file by 3 p m  tomorrow 
you ve got till then
to make up your mind 
  you motherfucker 
  excuse me 
  you leaked it 
  leaked what 
don t bullshit me  tom 
bullshit you 
i have no idea what you re talking about 
  i just spoke to ida horowicz 
  yeah 
she s threatening
to release the story 
  what fucking story 
  that we met  that we fucking met 
  how did she find out 
  don t play dumb  tom 
  you think i leaked it to her 
  yeah  who else 
  i didn t leak it to her  steve 
  well  i know i didn t  so that leaves you 
okay  well 
what does she know 
she knows whatever you told her 
i swear to jesus i did
not leak it to her  steve 
i don t want this story out
any more than you do 
  well  too late 
  what did she tell you 
she knows where we met 
she knows when we met 
she knows you had
fucking buffalo wings 
  she has a source 
  yeah  she has a source 
and you have no idea
who it could be 
yeah  you 
well  for the record  it wasn t me 
and i didn t have fucking buffalo wings 
so it s gotta be someone else 
  did you tell anyone 
  no  did you 
  no 
  did you admit to meeting with me 
  no 
  all right 
then we stonewall her
and she s got nothing 
she s gonna take the story to drudge
or to roll call or some shit like that 
you can t stop her 
she s trying to blackmail me 
she wants info about thompson 
well  then tell her
what she wants to know 
i can t do that 
  you can t let this story get out 
  i m not gonna be blackmailed tom 
you don t have much
choice here  steve 
if i tell her about thompson  i m gonna
have to tell her that he s endorsing you 
then tell her  i can handle it from
my side if i start getting calls 
no fucking way 
paul told her we had thompson in a bag 
it s gonna make him
look like a fuckin  fool 
he s gonna look like a fuckin  fool anyway
when thompson endorses us 
i can t do it 
you know  you re on
a sinking ship  steve 
tell her what she
wants to know and jump 
come over to our side 
we can control this thing 
  steve 
  i gotta go 
i m up here 
you scared the shit out of me 
here 
it s almost 1800 bucks 
you gotta make the appointment now 
like today  from a pay phone 
i ll take you to the clinic and
i ll pick you up  but no one else 
you understand 
yeah 
take the rest of the money
and buy yourself a ticket home 
can t be here anymore 
we can t afford it 
not with everything that s
gonna happen in the next week 
and this situation 
just can t be here 
  you mean i can t be here 
  right 
stephen  i wouldn t tell anyone 
i hope not 
then why 
because you fucked up 
  he and i both fucked up 
  that s true 
but i have a responsibility to
him and  more importantly 
i have a responsibility
to this campaign 
i could go to north carolina
and work on the campaign 
molly  you gotta wake the fuck up 
this is the big leagues  it s mean 
when you make a mistake 
you lose the right to play 
make the appointment 
tell me when and
where we have to go 
listen to this 
i got the placement in the times 
bumped like 600 fucking articles 
tom duffy  2008 
 this is a matchup
between hope vs  fear 
nine times out of 10  the fear
candidate tends to be most experienced 
but in our presidential races 
the least experienced
candidate almost always wins 
jfk vs  nixon  carter vs  ford 
bush vs  gore 
i like our chances with
the new kid on the block  
end quote 
thomas fucking duffy 
he s gotta be having
a stroke right now 
so just call me when
you can leave  okay 
i hate this shit 
i m gonna come back 
and this is all gonna be over 
yeah 
absolutely 
there s no question about it 
yeah  but we gotta think
broader strokes here 
just rethink everything 
uh    well  yeah 
i know how to handle it 
um  look  stevie just got here 
can i call you back in a few minutes 
okay  bye 
ahem  the governor 
we had a good long
talk on the way back 
he s up to speed
with everything 
how d he take it 
better than i
thought he would 
still won t take
thompson s endorsement 
paul i gotta tell you something
i don t know how to tell you 
what s up 
ida knows that
i met with duffy 
i don t know how she knows 
but she knows 
and she tried to blackmail me 
she said she s gonna release the
story unless i tell her all the details
about your meeting
with thompson 
so it s gonna hit
the papers 
probably 
and whoever she takes it to
is gonna call me for a statement 
if i deny the whole thing all together 
but duffy admits to it 
it s gonna look even worse 
and if i just say   no comment  
they re not gonna let up 
i leaked it to ida 
at the event 
  i don t understand 
  we made a deal 
paul  they re gonna   
they re gonna print that story
in the paper tomorrow morning 
i know 
so why d you do it 
why would you do that 
why would you do
that to the campaign 
the campaign will survive 
  why would you do that to me 
  makes it easier to let you go 
what 
why d you meet with duffy 
i made a mistake 
  i made a stupid mistake 
  no  no stephen 
you didn t make a mistake 
you made a choice 
you called me and left a message
to call you back  that was important 
and when i did 
you told me to forget about it 
you chose not to tell me 
why d you make that choice 
because  paul 
i didn t think it was important 
oh  fuck yes  you did 
but you went because you were curious 
because you felt flattered 
because you felt special   
to think that duffy wanted
to speak to you instead of me 
because you thought yourself  maybe i
can get something out of this   because   
because it made you feel big 
you know  the first campaign i ran 
it was a tiny little race in kentucky 
hm    state senate seat 
working for some redneck
nobody named sam mcguthrie 
no staff  no money 
no fucking office 
everyone thought
we didn t stand a chance 
no way we can compete  right 
and about this time 
this guy running this congressional
campaign a few districts over
gives me a call  and he says 
i really like what you re
able to do for poor old sam 
but  let s face  he s a goner 
why don t you come work for me 
what did i do 
well  stephen  this is where
you and i are different 
i told sam about the call 
and sam says to me 
 paul  if you think this other
guy s got a chance at winning
and he can pay you more
that anything i can afford
and if it s what you feel you need to do 
then i won t get in your way  
and i say 
 sam  you took a chance on me
and hired me when i was even
more of a nobody than you are 
so i ll be damned if i m gonna jump ship
just because the shit hits the fan  
we lost that race  but three years later
when sam decided to run for governor 
who do you think he called 
we won that race  and 20 years later
i am where i am fucking now 
now  there s only one thing i value
in this world  stephen  and that s loyalty 
and without it  you re nothing 
and you have no one 
and in politics 
in fucking politics 
it s the only currency
you can count on 
that s why i m letting you go 
not because you re not good enough 
not because i don t like you 
but i value trust over skill 
and i don t fucking trust you anymore 
it doesn t matter whether
you trust me  paul 
it matters whether the governor does 
the governor already knows 
and he thinks it s
the right thing to do 
he does 
yeah  and you know what 
if i were you 
i d get a good night s sleep 
because you re gonna get fucking pounded
by calls from the press in the morning 
  hey 
  hey  where were you today 
um  i m not feeling great today  ben 
you picked a hell of a
day to call in sick 
  jesus  it was a fucking wild ass day 
  why  what happened 
stephen s off the campaign 
paul fired him 
some fucking setup about loyalty 
and looks like stephen may have
been doubling down with duffy 
on the pullman campaign 
i    i was sitting in the room when
paul told stephen he was fired 
and stephen said   who s gonna take over  
and paul said me 
i know  and i m like 
 easy there  soldier  
and then stephen goes apeshit 
paul gives him this speech about loyalty 
and then shits out stephen
like i ve never seen before 
i mean   
  humiliating shit 
  when was this 
molly  listen to me 
i m gonna run the
campaign under paul 
stephen s going to duffy 
i just jumped three years ahead 
so starting tomorrow morning 
we go into full damage control 
and i m telling you 
stephen s going apeshit 
he said he s taking everybody
down on his way out 
morris  everybody 
shit  i gotta take this 
do you need anything 
no 
paul  what s up 
i m mailing you all those files 
  where s duffy 
  you got an appointment 
joe  can we have the
room for a minute 
okay 
thank you 
it s not too bright walking
in here like that  steve 
i m in 
i m coming to work for you 
a reporter from roll call
phoned me this afternoon 
yeah 
i know who leaked it 
  who 
  paul 
you told paul 
  i told paul  and he leaked it 
  oh  steve 
  you shouldn t have told him that 
  i felt like i should 
yeah  i ve worked with paul 
he gets paranoid 
  obviously 
  so he fired you 
  i quit 
  no  you re lying to me  come on man 
i quit  i m gonna
give you everything 
i m gonna give you morris 
i m gonna give you his whole strategy   
i don t need his strategy 
i already have it 
paul gave it all to thompson 
what if i had something else 
you would do that
to morris  to paul 
  yeah 
  oh  no 
revenge makes
people unpredictable 
steve  i can t have someone who s
unpredictable  who s unstable 
  i m not unstable 
  you know  if this had been a clean break 
if you had left morris before
the story broke  that d be one thing
that  we could control 
but like this 
paul fires you  and then you
wanna come work for me 
it makes me look like
i m picking up the scraps 
it puts morris in the driver s seat 
i can t have that 
  what if i had something big 
  like what 
something big 
something that ll
put morris down 
what is it 
give me the job 
no  that s not gonna happen 
i m sorry 
go take a nice long vacation 
you re a smart guy 
everything that i said the
other day is absolutely true 
but  you know 
maybe politics isn t for you 
politics is my life 
oh  you know what  do yourself a favor 
get out  now  while you still can 
go into entertainment
or business 
go open a fucking restaurant
in costa rica  anything 
do something that s gonna
make you happy  okay 
because if you stay in this
business long enough 
you re gonna get jaded and cynical 
  like you 
  yeah  just like me 
you knew i was gonna
fucking tell paul  didn t you 
no  i didn t know  i thought
you might  but i didn t know 
you knew i was gonna tell him  and you
knew he was gonna fucking fire me 
well that s the thing about paul 
he s big on loyalty 
yeah  i know 
i just got a big speech on it 
you were never
gonna hire me 
put yourself in my shoes  steve 
your opponent has the best media
mind in the country working for his team 
what are you gonna do 
you re either gonna hire him for yourself 
or you re gonna work it
so if you can t have him 
the other team can t either 
this is a win win situation for me 
and you come work for me  great 
paul doesn t have you 
then again  paul fires you 
i don t want you  fine 
paul still doesn t have you 
either way  i win 
and the moment i got you
to sit down in that chair   
  i knew i d won 
  this is   
it s my life that
you re talking about 
it doesn t make me happy
doing this kind of things 
don t think it gives me any pleasure 
no  i m sorry for you

that this was an accidental overdose 
a lethal cocktail of alcohol
and prescription drugs 
cincinnati s police chief darryl matthews
has called for a full investigation
pending a toxicology report 
which could take up to two weeks 
just a terrible  terrible situation
for the former senator 
now dnc chairman  jack stearns
and his family 
i want on the ticket 
you need me on that ticket 
and you could use my delegates 
and you need them
before tuesday 
make a fine story on the
sunday morning news cycle 
so i expect to hear from
you by noon tomorrow
or i endorse pullman and
take that cabinet seat 
anything else you wanna
talk about  stephen 
  the entire staff is   
  we re in a state of shock 
we send our condolences to jack and
joanna stearns and their entire family 
of course 
our hearts go out to them 
it s hard to imagine what
they must be going through 
what we know right now is that
it appears to have been a drug   
an accidental
prescription overdose 
  ida 
  is suicide ruled out 
we have no reason to believe   
i don t think we have any information yet 
but obviously there will
be a full investigation 
we just wanted to say
that our hearts go out 
our prayers go out 
to the entire family 
she really is   
she was part of our family 
yeah 
did you know her well 
not well  but i did know her 
and what i saw was
a hard working young woman
with a great spirit 
it s just a sad day
for the campaign 
and it s a sad day for
those of us who know jack 
governor  how long has
she interned for you 
uh    you wanna    
yeah 
she had only been on the
road with us for a few weeks 
maybe four weeks 
i think  i can check 
will you be continuing
with your schedule today 
yes  we will most certainly
stay on schedule 
seems like you have something
you wanna talk to me about 
does it seem that way 
if you have something   
if you think you have something
you wanna get off your chest 
then why don t you 
how about i do the talking
and you do the listening 
okay 
as of tomorrow  there s gonna be
a few changes to your campaign 
paul s out  i m your
senior campaign manager 
i ll draft a statement 
 the campaign got to a point
where we needed to make changes  
  you can put your own words in there 
  why would i do that 
because you wanna win 
because you broke
the only rule in politics 
you wanna be president 
you can start a war 
you can lie  you can cheat 
you can bankrupt the country 
but you can t fuck the interns 
they ll get you for that 
what do you think
you have  stephen 
  a troubled young girl tells you a story 
  a troubled young pregnant girl
  is that what she told you 
  who needed cash for an abortion 
what did you do 
you give her money 
maybe she needed cash and you
were the perfect guy to hit up 
  is that your best play 
  you need a job that bad  stephen 
you come in here with
your dick in your hand 
you got nothing 
then how did i get in here 
you re right  mike  there s nothing 
there s no voice messages  no texts 
no e mails  no pictures  no tape 
and yet i m standing right here 
yeah  well go home 
she left a note 
  how would you know that 
  i was cleaning up your mess 
i took her phone 
and i found a note 
  i thought it was an accident 
  i don t know mike 
you re gonna have to tell me 
you re the last person she called 
note says she s pregnant 
got an abortion 
and doesn t wanna hurt you 
then why would she leave a
note that could only do that 
because she s 20 
  what do you want 
  paul s gone  today 
i set a meeting with you and thompson 
and you promise him the ticket 
you get 356 pledged delegates 
you get north carolina 
you take office 
and you make right what so
many people have made wrong 
  all the things we both believe in 
  well  i don t believe in extortion 
i don t believe in tying myself
to you for the next eight years 
four years 
let s not get ahead of ourselves 
huh 
what were you
doing in her room 
housekeeping 
before you made page 1 
no  you were fired  you were out 
what were you doing in her room 
i was fixing a situation 
i got a call  someone from the hotel
thought i could help and called 
so you were off the campaign 
but you thought it was
important to fix things 
it was your voice the
other night on the phone 
you were fucking her 
what d you do  stephen 
  i lent her money and gave her a ride 
  i bet you did 
there s no note 
  okay mike  there s no note 
  show it to me 
you think i brought it here 
that s how people get hurt 
okay  let s play this out 
you re not wearing a wire 
because everything you suggested is illegal 
and you wouldn t fare too well
in federal prison 
you were fucking her 
and she told you about her situation 
there are no records or
conversations between the two of us 
and since she s had an abortion 
there s no dna evidence 
so if there s no note   
then it s your word
against mine 
your word 
a fired  disgruntled employee 
or a sitting governor 
there s no note 
it s your call  governor 
  paul  you got a minute 
  yeah 
how much could a
big shake up like this 
days before the ohio primary 
hurt a campaign 
i asked paul zara how his firing
could actually help the candidate 
the governor and i felt that
in light of these changing numbers
that it was best to put
a new face on the campaign 
stephen is very talented 
uh  very smart 
you always hear people talk
about events out of sequence 
the order of things 
there is no greater grief
than a parent laying
their child to rest 
she was a little girl trying to make
it in a very grown up world 
a world where every
mistake is magnified 
and she was smart and
pretty and so  so young 
father  you ask us
to accept god s plan 
to not question his judgment 
with all due respect 
i don t accept this judgment 
she made the world better 
not just for me 
but for everyone she touched 
you should hire jack
for a speechwriter 
i ll keep it in mind 
  you come here to see me 
  no  friend of the family 
got her the internship 
i ve known her since she was born 
i m sorry 
governor couldn t make the flight 
he s meeting with thompson 
look at you 
all grown up with tits and all 
i learned from the best 
well  one day we ll grab a beer 
and you can tell me
what you had on the
governor that put me out 
how do you know i didn t
have something on you 
well  you better get going 
you have a campaign to run 
i ve got offices to look at 
farragut north 
nice consultant firm
right off of k street 
million a year 
no one to fuck you over 
  sounds relaxing 
  doesn t it 
the right man to lead
this great nation of ours
in these challenging times 
and the next president of
the united states of america 
governor mike morris 
we like mike 
and let me ask one
very important thing 
that all of us stand shoulder
to shoulder  arm in arm 
in a united democratic party 
so i strongly urge the
356 loyal delegates
that i have carried
as a badge of honor
throw their support
to the governor 
let s put this primary behind us
and get on with the business
of 1600 pennsylvania avenue 
thank you  god bless you 
and god bless the
united states of america 
governor mike morris 
ladies and gentlemen 
senator thompson  thank you 
all right  mr  president 
well  the polls aren t quite closed 
but i congratulate senator pullman
and his republican constituents
on their win here in ohio 
senator thompson  i am honored
to stand here with you today 
and i am humbled by your kind words 
thank you 
ladies and gentlemen 
today marks the beginning of a
fight between two sets of ideals 
either we re gonna move forward 
or we re going to live in the past 
either we re going to lead
the world again in technology
or we are going to bury
our heads in the sand 
the sands of saudi arabia 
the sands of iraq 
either we re going to let
greed and corruption
ruin our industries
and our shorelines
or we are going to
take back our country 
we are not a nation
used to coming in second
or third 
  no  it s not decisive 
  we still have several contests to go 
those states are gonna
wanna have their say 
it looks like we re gonna win ohio 
you must concede  sir 
that these 356 delegates
put the pledged
delegates out of reach 
the superdelegates are breaking
3 to 1 for morris   
we still have several contests to go 
and ohio was a big win for us 
then do you have the funds 
of course we have the funds 
we get new donations daily 
  hey  ben 
  yep 
  i was told to talk to you 
  i m supposed to get a phone 
  and you are    
  jill morris 
no relation 
  you a bearcat  jill morris 
  no  i m from columbus 
i m a buckeye 
you re making me look bad 
  how so 
  i filed the story that said
you re off the campaign and
thompson s going to pullman 
can t believe
everything you read 
wanna give you an opportunity
to comment on my next story 
it says you delivered thompson 
you got the 356 delegates 
you delivered the nomination 
and all you asked in
return was paul s job 
  any chance of you confirming 
  no press behind this point  she s press 
  i ll read about it in the funny papers 
  come on  stephen 
aren t we friends anymore 
you re my best friend  ida 
  jay  this is sean in new york 
  can you get him to run a mike check 
if you could
count to 10 for me 
one  two  three  four  five  six 
seven  eight  nine  ten 
good  okay 
senator thompson  i am proud
that you have brought integrity
back to this election 
because that s what this comes out 
integrity 
  stand by 
  who we are 
because how we project
ourselves to the world matters 
dignity matters  integrity matters 
our future depends on it 
morris  morris  morris 
we have now governor morris 
new senior campaign adviser 
stephen meyers  coming to us
from xavier university
where senator thompson has
just endorsed governor morris 
essentially ending
