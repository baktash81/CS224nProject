im not muslim
my religion and
what i believe in
is called the constitution
of the united states of america
hang on
did you get that
and let me open these up
hmm
okay go ahead
if im not religious enough for you
dont vote for me
if im not experienced
enough for you
dont vote for me
uh
you know what dont vote for me
dont dont do it
whatever you do
dont vote for me hows that
okay
okay we got it thanks
can we get the monitors up a little
id like the governor to
be able to hear himself
you got it
okay
also are we gonna put risers
under these podiums
like we discussed
in the preconditions
no i know we didnt get
the specs till last night
theyre making something
slide right under that
okay thank you
its just theyre few inches short
so it makes it hard for him
to read his notes
okay
gentlemen thank you
and i see you in a few hours
didnt know the governor
had trouble reading his notes
why he isnt wearing glasses
no he doesnt just pullman is 58
hes gonna look like a hobbit
i like mike i like mike
well it all comes down to this
we are one week away
from the ohio primary
two democrats on left standing
senator pullman of arkansas
trailing governor morris
of pennsylvania
governor morris has mounted
a sizable lead with 2047 delegates
winning new hampshire california
new york and michigan
but senator pullman with 1302
delegates is still in the hunt
having won florida and tennessee
and virginia and missouri
a win in ohio could turn it all
around for the arkansas senator
one week from tuesday
the allimportant 161 ohio delegates
could be the deciding factor
once again it is true
as goes ohio so goes the nation
would you call yourself christian
how would that matter
let me quote i have no idea
what happens when we die
maybe nothing maybe its like
before we were born unquote
you did write this governor
let me be specific
please do
i was raised catholic
i am not a practicing catholic
and i have no idea what
happens after we die
if the senator does
maybe he should be president
ill vote for him
is that your idea of being specific
let me be more specific
thank you
i am not a christian or an atheist
im not jewish or muslim
what i believe my religion
is written on a piece of paper
called the constitution
meaning that i will defend
until my dying breath your right
to worship in whatever
god you believe in
as long as it doesnt hurt others
i believe we should be judged as a country
by how we take care of the people
who cannot take care of themselves
thats my religion
if you think im not religious enough
dont vote for me
if you think im not experienced enough
or tall enough dont vote for me
because i cant change
that to get elected
i just wanted you to say out loud
if you believe in the teaches of the bible
is this a democratic primary
or a general election
well governor whoever wins this
contest will be running for president
and if you think that
these questions wont be central
in a general election
then you are living in fantasy land
im simply pointing to the obvious
we are running for president
of the united states
not student council president
double
yeah double
fucking national security
out of the park
home run
the alumni of miami
university of ohio
would like to thank you for
attending tonights debate
and ask you to please remain in your seats
until the candidates have left the stage
thank you very much
you know im trying to
remember if the democrats
have ever nominated
an atheist before
well we know theyve
nominated a jackass before
oh must have been you
that did that prep work stephen
pauls not that clever
youve always had the brain stuff
but me ive had the balls
well it looks like youve
got some brains now too
be careful i just might
have to steal him from you
hm
what a prick
well meet again
dont know where
dont know when
but i know well meet again
some sunny day oh
so paul tell me something i dont know
tell me whats going
to happen on the 15th
oh god
what
what do you think stevie
i think its ours for the taking you
yeah ben
yeah well win
what do you think ida
im asking you
oh you tell me ill tell you
if i had to say id say itll be close
but youll eke it out
eke
you see
shes trying to get under my skin
so whats gonna happen
us by nine
so youre certain
youre gonna win here
certain no confident yeah
you just said youll win by nine
and i think that we will im not
gonna tell you its a sure thing
if the fucking saint gabriel can
blow his horn on election day
and get his four horsemen
to rig the ballot boxes for pullman
and it wouldnt surprise me
six presidentials ive done
and ive never felt this good
but im not gonna sit here and say
yeah hey well win ohio
not a chance
in the last 30 years
73 democrats have run for president
how many have won three
that means 70 guys ran who thought
they had a chance and they all lost
so youre saying theres
a big chance you wont win
dont twist my words ida
what im saying is im not
gonna promise you well win
but hes a decorated of bush junior from
the first gulf war he protested the second
he left his state with a balanced budget
and the fourthhighest education rate
the republicans have no one
out there that can touch this guy
for this moment this election
this primary is the presidential
and that ida
is the state of the union
and on that note
im gonna take a shit
so stephen
so ida
stephen stephen stephen
ida ida ida
pauls going to the airport
yeah
hes getting on a plane
thats what you do going at airport yeah
wheres that plane going
okay
ill give you three guesses
hes not going back to headquarters
correct
hes not going to texas
no need were gonna split texas
so its a wash
what if i said north carolina
is that your guess
hes going to north carolina
i can neither confirm nor deny that
i knew it now tell me why
i cannot do that
ugh i hate you
you love me
i love paul you i hate
you love him because
he gives you the scoops
sexual favors
youre engaged
if it meant a good scoop
my fiance would understand
you really buy
into all this crap
all this take back the country nonsense
ida im not naive okay
ive worked on more campaigns
than most people have
by the time theyre 40
im telling you this is the one
you really have drunk the koolaid
i have drunk it its delicious
look i dont care if he happens
to be leading in the polls
and i dont care if he happens
to have all the right tools
the truth is hes the only one
thats gonna actually make a
difference in the peoples lives
even the people that hate him
if mike morris is president
it says more about us
than it does about him
i dont give a fuck if he can win
he has to win
or what what
the worlds gonna fall apart
it wont matter not one bit
to the everyday lives
or the everyday fuckers
who get up and work
and eat and sleep
go back to work again
you know if your boy wins
you get a job in the white house
he loses youre back at a
consulting firm on the k street
thats it
you used to know that
before you got all
goosebumpy about this guy
mike morris is a politician
hes a nice guy
theyre all nice guys
he will let you down
sooner or later
scuse me
while i
disappear
this is offoffoff the record
what
franklin thompson
seriously
off the record the only people who know
are the governor stephen and me
my lips are sealed

why our enemies are our enemies
and see if theres something we can
do about that besides just using force
as we know from history
the answer to extremism
cant be extremism
fucking kill me
whoever throws their hat in
whoever decides
where did we get this
some townhall meeting
in pennsylvania before the announce
thank god it wasnt overseas

this is the exact same piece the republicans
are gonna run against him in the general
we dont need to brag about it
im neville chamberlain
id like to be your commander in chief
then if its gonna come out anyway
then its gonna come out but its not
gonna come out paid for by us pal

in this pullman having investments
in a diamond mine in liberia
still checking on it but we got
it from a blog so who the fuck
i dont care if its true
i just wanna hear him denying it
if it is true great find out
but if not let them spend
the day telling the post
that he doesnt own
a diamond mine in liberia
winwin

thats what im hearing
since super tuesday all of a sudden
im a very popular guy
what are your
polls telling you
that pullmans negatives
are high mid 40s
senator we have an open
seat in the white house
the republicans have dick
theyre disorganized
they cant find a nominee
thats not a worldclass fuckup
they look like democrats
no republicans gonna
show up to vote for their guy
but if pullman gets the democratic nod
they will show up to vote against him
and you think they wont for your guy
you think morris gets the independents
i sure do
senator im a bit confused
we need your delegates
we need you
your fundraising
and i guess
it was my understanding
that your endorsement
a week before ohio
would win this for us
thank you
estella
hand me that ice bucket
is this paul or is this you
paul knows and paul agrees
ben wheres my oped piece
on national service
its easier for me to work off of that
got it right here
give me a hard copy
i hate those fucking things
can we print it out
molly can you grab it a print for me
yeah one second
so if you wanna change or refresh
just give me a second will you
your national service isnt polling
the same as the rest of your policy
i dont give a shit about
the polling stephen
im not gonna play this game with you
this is your goodcop
badcop act with paul
goodcop goodcop
im not changing it
here we go
all right lets see
it says were gonna help
people get an education
were gonna create national unity
were gonna teach young people a trade
and were gonna to get them out
of debt for their college loans
now where does that fail
all of thats exactly right governor
just if youre gonna do it do it
make it mandatory not voluntary
now thatll poll well
mandatory
everybody who turns 18
or graduates high school
gives two years of service
to his or her country
it can be in the military peace corps
planting fucking trees i dont care
for that your college
education is paid for period
we do all of that right here
no sir you dont not all the way
do it all the way mandatory
paul likes this
mmhm
youre my brain trust
the beauty of it is that everybody
whos over the age of 18
or pass the age of
eligibility will be for it
why not
and all of the others
cant vote
too young
too bad
you cant lose
uh stephen
mm
you have a call on line 3
its your dad
okay
you and ben work it
on this stump speech
and youll get me a hard copy
and ill write it in my own words
dont forget you have charlie rose at 6
right yeah why am i doing him
its longform
hes flying in
paul going
paul wont be in
but ben and i will take you
just dont tell me someones died
hey steve
who is this
tom duffy
sorry about the dad bit
uh i just figured you wouldnt
want my name called out
at a morris campaign office
what do you want
you got a couple minutes
id like to sit down with you
what for
well i think its important
well if its important dont you think
you should be calling paul
im calling you
this is on the upandup
steve give me five minutes
i cant be talking to you
i hear you
but if you got five minutes
im gonna be at the head first sport bar
for the next couple of hours
i cant tom
there wont be anybody there
okay
you get a chance
theres something i wanna show you
paul call me back its important
youre working for the wrong man
you are working for the wrong man
oh on the contrary you are the
one working for the wrong man
and you got something
the other guys dont have
yeah
yeah what is it exactly
charm is not
the right word
it is the right word
no its more than that
you exude something
you draw people in
all the reporters love you
even the ones that hate you love you
cause you play them like the pieces on
a chessboard and make it look effortless
and we both know
how hard it is
constantly being on guard
weighing every word every move
but from the outside
you make it look easy
people are scared of you
cause they dont understand how
you do it and they love you for it
and that is the most
valuable thing in this business
the ability to win
peoples respect
by making them mistake
their fear for love
you can guess what
im gonna say next
i dont think that i can
i want you to work for us
what are you kidding
no not in the least
youre gonna lose ohio
i am not
oh youre sitting on about
a six percent lead in both polls
six percent of
all democrats polled
eight
no six doesnt matter
ohio is an open primary right
independents and republicans get
the vote on the democratic candidate
do you think they like your guy
a prochoice taxandspend liberal
no fuck no no they hate him
they think they can beat my guy
but theyre very worried about yours
so starting tomorrow morning
youre gonna see a fucking blitz
limbaugh hannity
all those rightwing blogs
are starting a
getoutthevote campaign
its started already
every fuckin conservative in ohio
is gonna line up around the block
to punch my guys ticket
and thats just one step
ohios gone
polls dont mean shit
tomorrow morning
everybodys gonna know
and thats why i want you to handle
the fallout that well have in the press
oh and we got thompson
in the bag too
i know for a fact that
you dont have thompson
no we promised him
secretary of state
ohio is over
it has been over for weeks
and now with thompsons
delegates huh
im thinking down the road here man
that is why i want you
i cant do it
bring you straight at the top
i cant do it
all right
i dont need an answer
right this moment
look ive played dirty all right
im sorry to hear it
but i dont have to play dirty anymore
you know why i got morris
no no none of this is about
the democratic process steve
its about getting your guy off
this is the shit republicans pull
yeah you know what
this is the kind of shit
that the republicans pull
and its about time we learned from them
theyre meaner theyre tougher
theyre more disciplined than we are
ive been in this business 25 years
and ive seen way too
many democrats bite the dust
because they wouldnt get down in
the mud with the fucking elephants
pauls my friend
you wanna work for the friend
or do you wanna work
for the president
think about it
you got my number
paul
hey they dont make
quaaludes anymore do they
not that im aware of
whats going on with thompson
uh he wants something but
well be fine
what was so important
nothing figured it out
all right
ill be on my cell if you need me
i fly to dc tomorrow
back tomorrow night
okay ill work on the quaaludes
good man
check the blogs and see if theres
any chatter would you
chatter what kind of chatter
i dont know
just see what theyre talking about
stevie you still single
im married to the campaign governor
hes married to the campaign
good answer
wall street journal
has our numbers holding
pullman dropped a point
really when did they do that
checking now
governor the wall street journal numbers
are running pullmans down a point
uh were moving
in the right direction
ben are you still single
married to the campaign governor
crack team
make sure charlie rose has
those numbers before he goes on
im on it
get a copy of the show
before we leave too
is it a difficult decision
i have to believe it is
would i do it no
but i cant see myself
or anyone
certainly not a government telling a
woman what she should do with her body
so you would appoint a judge
i would consider it arrogant to judge
anyone until ive walked in their shoes
but youre against the death penalty
mmhmm
because of what it says
about us as a society
suppose governor
it was your wife
and she was murdered
what would i do
it gets more complicated
when its personal
sure
well if i could get to him
uh i would find a way to kill him
so you you governor
would impose a death penalty
no i would commit a crime
for which i would happily go to jail
then why not let
society do that
because society has to be
better than the individual
if i were to do that
i would be wrong
what about guns
isnt it time for a commercial
this is public television
we dont have any commercials
thats unfortunate
where did you go after iowa
california
for super tuesday
oh
i had to go to new york
i know
you guys needed a lot
more help over there
yeah
so why politics
because the pay
is so good obviously
it seems like a very odd fit
my dad is jack stearns
oh hes a good guy
hes an asshole
but hes your boss
hes not my boss
hes the head of the dnc
you dont work for the
democratic national committee
i work for paul
paul works for morris
and if morris wins
hes gonna be your dads boss
dont tell my dad that
dont tell your dad
a lot of things
never
what time you gotta
work tomorrow
nine am
im showing the new
interns how to robocall
its because im the
experienced intern you see
i see
how old are you
how old do you think i am
thirty
you think im 30
sorry how old are you
thirty
how old are you
how old do you think i am
twentyone
twenty
yep
thats young
is that too young
to fuck a 30yearold
well
you see the laws are
different in different states
here at your hotel here in
kentucky its frowned upon
oh
but if we go across
the bridge into ohio
where your hotel is
yeah surprisingly
theyre very lax about their
childendangerment laws
do you have a car i dont drive
i took a cab
i have the keys
to the campaign bus
it fairness this has been tried before
operation chaos
as russ limbaugh called it
where republicans voted for a democrat
they thought they could
beat in the general election
we asked senator pullmans
campaign manager
if hes happy getting the
votes of rightwingers
is it decisive no of course not
but look we believe the polls
are within the margin of error
and that the senator
will win ohio
yeah what times paul get in
shit who do we talk
to about polling
i gotta get some internal polling on the
independents and the fucking wing nuts
do you want me to go
whats that guys name
from the wall street journal
you sound busy i should go
could you hold on a second
id like to talk to you about something
adler yeah get him on the line
nobody the cleaning lady
get him on the line
tell him were gonna take the
same position weve always said
the race is a lot closer than the polling
no dont say that dont
just get him on the line and call me
ill take care of it im sorry
cleaning lady
yeah
you called me
the cleaning lady
youre not mad
about that are you
no why would i be mad
right
i spoke with jack stearns
oh hey look
i know youre looking for
a reaction but listen
we have two great candidates
in a very tight race
and at the end of the day
the voters will decide
who best can
represent this party
i understand jack but
doesnt this kind disruption
take away from what you guys
wanna be pushing this year
youre right
your dad is an asshole
im gonna tell him you said that
yeah do that
you wanted to talk to me about something
yeah i just wanna be clear
i dont want there to be any confusion
im not gonna tell
anybody about last night
thatd be great
if we kept it between us
you know how people are
yeah
really wouldnt look good
if you screwed an intern
its not like that
its not like i got drunk
i like you
i just dont want there
to be any expectations here
steve you dont have to say anything
all right
i just dont want you
to think im a player
you are kind of a player but
i was being polite
bullshit
you were trying to pick me up
no i wasnt
you were pretty obvious about it
i was
yeah
i thought i was being smooth and subtle
no you were pretty forward
you were pretty forward
asking me to the bar
well been trying to fuck you for a while
wow
its kind of slutty of me huh
not at all
i respect it in some strange way
good
you absolutely have no idea
how to tie a tie
no no not a clue
youre very mature
for a teenager
when are you coming back
ill be at the event a little late
these cocksuckers fucking dirty shit
what happened with thompson
nothing prick
we had him all sewed up
motherfucker
how bad is it
i dont know i just
im running the numbers paul
all right ill
ill be there in three hours
i want hard numbers
and a strategy
yeah im on it i gotta go
you okay
yeah just trying to figure out our stops
think the weather
might determine that
if we get there
were gonna be fine
we have to do it
its the right thing to do
nothing bad happens when
youre doing the right thing
is this your personal theory
because i can shoot holes in it
roberto clemente
on a humanitarian flight
well theres
theres exceptions to every rule
so how we doing
i think were fine now
no the campaign how we doing
oh great
stephen youre not paul
i pay paul to use the word great
i pay you to tell me the truth
i think that we are solid
okay paul
governor theres a big difference
between paul and me
paul only believes in winning
so hell do or say anything to win
but you wouldnt
ill do or say anything
if i believe in it
but i have to believe in the cause
youll make a lousy consultant
when youre out of this line of work
well i wont be out of this line
of work as long as youre in it sir
so at best
you got eight years
then you end up at a nice
consultant firm off farragut north
making 750 grand a year
eating at the palm
pimping out exsenators
to saudi princes
pimping out expresidents
then i better win
yeah
now ive been married for 11 years
we have a normal marriage
which means when we disagree she wins
what we dont disagree on
is how were gonna leave
this planet for our daughter
are we gonna leave
it better off or worse
the richest people in this country
dont pay their fair share
and when theyre asked to
they cry socialism
they use phrases like
redistribution of wealth
yeah
that scares everybody
and they all run and they hide
for the record
my campaign is vehemently
against the distribution of wealth
to the richest americans
by our government
and i will run on that
i didnt think it was true
but i shouldve told you
slow down
im sorry
i met with tom duffy yesterday
what
you were on a plane and he called
me and asked if we could meet
i said why he said
it was very important so i did
and i should have fucking told you
stop stop let me get this straight
you met with tom duffy
yeah
whatd he want stephen
the gist he wants to hire me
he wants me to jump ship
and come and work for him
this is really fucking bad
he told me they had poll numbers
that had pullman ahead by 4
and were in big fuckin trouble
cause he laid out their strategy
doing robocalls traffic jams
fake lit and thompson
they offered thompson
secretary of state
you know how you fight
the war on terror
you dont need their product anymore
their product is oil
just dont need it and they go away
we dont have to bomb anyone
we dont have to invade anyone
if this is some kind of fucking practical
i mean
my fucking blood pressures going
through the goddamn roof right now
paul im sorry
believe me
i just didnt think it was true
oh it doesnt matter
what you fucking thought
it matters what you did
it matters what you didnt do
youre right
because if all this shit is true
i made a fucking ass out of
myself in thompsons place
and i gave away our game plan
please believe me
i honestly believed you were gonna come back
and tell me we have
thompson in the bag
i didnt see the point
it doesnt make it right and im sorry
let me think
let me think
if im your president
the first thing id put into motion
is 10 years from
the day i take office
no new car in america is run
on an internal combustion engine
we will create hundreds
of thousands of new jobs
we will start the next
technological revolution
and we will lead the world again
like we used to
get the governor right after
he finishes singing kumbaya
and we give him
everything we know
who do you want
you me and the governor thats it
whats he have after
he has a fundraiser
well hell be late
we tell him if he doesnt offer
thompson the cabinet position
hes not gonna get the nomination
is he gonna go for it
i dont fucking know stephen
find us a room
how real are the numbers
we might pick up a few points
but we lose by 3 or 4 percent
who fucking knows governor
but we cant take the chance
what do you think
i think we fold up the
campaign in ohio take a loss
blame it on republicans playing
games head to north carolina
i cant run from ohio theyll kill us
not if you get thompsons endorsement
im not gonna do it what does he want
head of the fda or something
cabinet post
yeah what labor
state
are you fuckin kidding me
im gonna give secretary of state
to a guy who wants to cut
the top 10 floors off the un
paul when we started this campaign
i said i wasnt gonna
make those kind of deals
governor if you lose ohio and
they get thompsons delegates
then they get north carolina
then they get the lead
a lead you cant beat
if we walk from ohio
take thompson
give him the fuckin cabinet post
then we take north carolina
his state
then pennsylvania your state
and then its simple math mike
take his endorsement
and the race is over
paul i respect you
i respect your opinion
im never gonna do it
so i suggest we find a
way for me to win ohio
anything else
its not gonna cut it
every car company in north of ohio
theyve booked every single van for tuesday
fuck jess i gotta call you back
all of them
all of them
youre killing me
heres what i got so far
independents arent biting
but the republicans are
theyre not gonna tell a pollster
theyre voting democratic
i cant find the goddamn polls
alright i also made a call
and im gonna get a hundred vans out of
convington and newport kentucky
we dont need the fucking vans
no no thats not what im saying
we dont want pullman to have the vans
we were the underdog before
we got into this
we continue to be the underdog
well then
yeah
we always knew the numbers were
gonna get closer as it get to tuesday
were not lowering expectations
i mean have i ever said to you
that we had ohio locked
well then at least give me the courtesy
of printing that in your column
what are you writing
the greatest speech ever
given on hydrogen power
the bar is set awfully
high on that one
dont i know it
i was hit up by mitchells
wife for you to show up
at her daughters of the
american revolution luncheon
whos mitchell
congressman from
the first district
you might wanna
remember that
fucking congressman
could you imagine doing
this every two years
no i cant
lets just do it one more time
mmhm
in four more years
thats it
its a deal
do you think well lose ohio
i dont know
if you took thompsons delegates
the race would be over
ohio wouldnt matter
is paul working on you
stephen
they are good
mm
is thompson so bad
hes a shit
is he worse than pullman
yes stephen
every time i draw a line in the
sand and then i i move it
fundraisers union deals
i wasnt gonna do any of it
negative ads
i cant on this one
not thompson
tell mrs mitchell ill make
her goddamn luncheon
let the old ladies
pat me on the head
youve got great hair
you too baby
gay marriage
its a silly argument
not to a 50 percent of americans
over the age of 50
thats who votes thats
who shows up at the polls
well thats changing hopefully
the way we frame the argument is as well
from a religious
from a religious to a civilrights issue
but one could argue a great
difference between gender and race
not really we used to ban interracial
marriages women couldnt vote
paul i have the guy from
proctor  gamble
keep an eye on the governor
okay
i gotta know whats going on
yeah yeah okay
all right wait wait wait
shes got a point to make go ahead
the argument is that men and women can
in fact be considered separate but equal
races cannot
how so
you have separate public bathrooms
for both men and women
but it would be illegal to have
separate bathrooms for two races
now
yes now
thats what im saying
see were framing the argument
what time is this thing airing
nine oclock
howd we do
we did good
yes i know but i tried to reach him
and i couldnt get through
yeah just email it to me
yeah
then i can give it to him
oh good so attach that
and send it as an email to me
yeah i missed
my opportunity there
now
yes now
were framing the
argument on the idea
that you choose to be gay
not that you were born that way
like being born africanamerican
if you start the
discussion with the idea
that gay is not a life choice
but is actually part of your dna
then gay marriage can and
must only be a civilrights issue
thats what i believe
thats where i stand
do you think your
candor is your appeal
sorry
fuck its not you
molly

she knows you had
fucking buffalo wings
she has a source

then we stonewall her
and shes got nothing
shes gonna take the story to drudge
or to roll call or some shit like that
you cant stop her
shes trying to blackmail me
she wants info about thompson
well then tell her
what she wants to know
i cant do that
you cant let this story get out
im not gonna be blackmailed tom
you dont have much
choice here steve
if i tell her about thompson im gonna
have to tell her that hes endorsing you
then tell her i can handle it from
my side if i start getting calls
no fucking way
paul told her we had thompson in a bag
its gonna make him
look like a fuckin fool
hes gonna look like a fuckin fool anyway
when thompson endorses us
i cant do it
you know youre on
a sinking ship steve
tell her what she
wants to know and jump
come over to our side

just cant be here
you mean i cant be here
right
stephen i wouldnt tell anyone
i hope not

because you fucked up
he and i both fucked up
thats true
but i have a responsibility to
him and more importantly
i have a responsibility
to this campaign
i could go to north carolina
and work on the campaign
molly you gotta wake the fuck up
this is the big leagues its mean
when you make a mistake
you lose the right to play
make the appointment
tell me when and
where we have to go
listen to this
i got the placement in the times
bumped like 600 fucking articles
tom duffy 2008
this is a matchup
between hope vs fear
nine times out of 10 the fear
candidate tends to be most experienced
but in our presidential races
the leastexperienced
candidate almost always wins
jfk vs nixon carter vs ford
bush vs gore
i like our chances with
the new kid on the block
end quote
thomas fucking duffy
hes gotta be having
a stroke right now
so just call me when
you can leave okay
i hate this shit
im gonna come back
and this is all gonna be over
yeah
absolutely
theres no question about it
yeah but we gotta think
broader strokes here
just rethink everything
uh well yeah
i know how to handle it
um look stevie just got here
can i call you back in a few minutes
okay bye
ahem the governor
we had a good long
talk on the way back
hes up to speed
with everything
howd he take it
better than i
thought he would
still wont take
thompsons endorsement
paul i gotta tell you something
i dont know how to tell you
whats up
ida knows that
i met with duffy
i dont know how she knows
but she knows
and she tried to blackmail me
she said shes gonna release the
story unless i tell her all the details
about your meeting
with thompson
so its gonna hit
the papers
probably
and whoever she takes it to
is gonna call me for a statement
if i deny the whole thing all together
but duffy admits to it
its gonna look even worse
and if i just say no comment
theyre not gonna let up
i leaked it to ida
at the event
i dont understand
we made a deal
paul theyre gonna
theyre gonna print that story
in the paper tomorrow morning
i know
so whyd you do it
why would you do that
why would you do
that to the campaign
the campaign will survive
why would you do that to me
makes it easier to let you go
what
whyd you meet with duffy
i made a mistake
i made a stupid mistake
no no stephen
you didnt make a mistake
you made a choice
you called me and left a message
to call you back that was important
and when i did
you told me to forget about it
you chose not to tell me
whyd you make that choice
because paul
i didnt think it was important
oh fuck yes you did
but you went because you were curious
because you felt flattered
because you felt special
to think that duffy wanted
to speak to you instead of me
because you thought yourself maybe i
can get something out of this because
because it made you feel big
you know the first campaign i ran
it was a tiny little race in kentucky
hm state senate seat
working for some redneck
nobody named sam mcguthrie
no staff no money
no fucking office
everyone thought
we didnt stand a chance
no way we can compete right
and about this time
this guy running this congressional
campaign a few districts over
gives me a call and he says
i really like what youre
able to do for poor old sam
but lets face hes a goner
why dont you come work for me
what did i do
well stephen this is where
you and i are different
i told sam about the call
and sam says to me
paul if you think this other
guys got a chance at winning
and he can pay you more
that anything i can afford
and if its what you feel you need to do
then i wont get in your way
and i say
sam you took a chance on me
and hired me when i was even
more of a nobody than you are
so ill be damned if im gonna jump ship
just because the shit hits the fan
we lost that race but three years later
when sam decided to run for governor
who do you think he called
we won that race and 20 years later
i am where i am fucking now
now theres only one thing i value
in this world stephen and thats loyalty
and without it youre nothing
and you have no one
and in politics
in fucking politics
its the only currency
you can count on
thats why im letting you go
not because youre not good enough
not because i dont like you
but i value trust over skill
and i dont fucking trust you anymore
it doesnt matter whether
you trust me paul
it matters whether the governor does
the governor already knows
and he thinks its
the right thing to do
he does
yeah and you know what
if i were you
id get a good nights sleep
because youre gonna get fucking pounded
by calls from the press in the morning
hey
hey where were you today
um im not feeling great today ben
you picked a hell of a
day to call in sick
jesus it was a fucking wildass day
why what happened
stephens off the campaign
paul fired him
some fucking setup about loyalty
and looks like stephen may have
been doubling down with duffy
on the pullman campaign
i i was sitting in the room when
paul told stephen he was fired
and stephen said whos gonna take over
and paul said me
i know and im like
easy there soldier
and then stephen goes apeshit
paul gives him this speech about loyalty
and then shits out stephen
like ive never seen before
i mean
humiliating shit
when was this
molly listen to me
im gonna run the
campaign under paul
stephens going to duffy
i just jumped three years ahead
so starting tomorrow morning
we go into full damage control
and im telling you
stephens going apeshit
he said hes taking everybody
down on his way out
morris everybody
shit i gotta take this
do you need anything
no
paul whats up
im mailing you all those files
wheres duffy

joe can we have the
room for a minute
okay

yeah
i know who leaked it
who
paul
you told paul
i told paul and he leaked it
oh steve
you shouldnt have told him that
i felt like i should
yeah ive worked with paul
he gets paranoid
obviously
so he fired you
i quit
no youre lying to me come on man
i quit im gonna
give you everything
im gonna give you morris
im gonna give you his whole strategy
i dont need his strategy
i already have it
paul gave it all to thompson
what if i had something else
you would do that
to morris to paul
yeah
oh no
revenge makes
people unpredictable
steve i cant have someone whos
unpredictable whos unstable
im not unstable
you know if this had been a clean break
if you had left morris before
the story broke thatd be one thing
that we could control
but like this
paul fires you and then you
wanna come work for me
it makes me look like
im picking up the scraps
it puts morris in the drivers seat
i cant have that
what if i had something big
like what
something big
something thatll
put morris down
what is it
give me the job
no thats not gonna happen
im sorry
go take a nice long vacation
youre a smart guy
everything that i said the
other day is absolutely true
but you know
maybe politics isnt for you
politics is my life
oh you know what do yourself a favor
get out now while you still can
go into entertainment
or business
go open a fucking restaurant
in costa rica anything
do something thats gonna
make you happy okay
because if you stay in this
business long enough
youre gonna get jaded and cynical
like you
yeah just like me
you knew i was gonna
fucking tell paul didnt you
no i didnt know i thought
you might but i didnt know
you knew i was gonna tell him and you
knew he was gonna fucking fire me
well thats the thing about paul
hes big on loyalty
yeah i know
i just got a big speech on it
you were never
gonna hire me
put yourself in my shoes steve
your opponent has the best media
mind in the country working for his team
what are you gonna do
youre either gonna hire him for yourself
or youre gonna work it
so if you cant have him
the other team cant either
this is a winwin situation for me
and you come work for me great
paul doesnt have you
then again paul fires you
i dont want you fine
paul still doesnt have you
either way i win
and the moment i got you
to sit down in that chair
i knew id won

the coroner stated that
based on the evidence
founded by the police in that hotel room
that this was an accidental overdose
a lethal cocktail of alcohol
and prescription drugs
cincinnatis police chief darryl matthews
has called for a full investigation
pending a toxicology report
which could take up to two weeks
just a terrible terrible situation
for the former senator
now dnc chairman jack stearns
and his family
i want on the ticket
you need me on that ticket
and you could use my delegates
and you need them
before tuesday
make a fine story on the
sundaymorning news cycle
so i expect to hear from
you by noon tomorrow
or i endorse pullman and
take that cabinet seat
anything else you wanna
talk about stephen
the entire staff is
were in a state of shock
we send our condolences to jack and
joanna stearns and their entire family
of course
our hearts go out to them
its hard to imagine what
they must be going through
what we know right now is that
it appears to have been a drug
an accidental
prescription overdose
ida
is suicide ruled out
we have no reason to believe
i dont think we have any information yet
but obviously there will
be a full investigation
we just wanted to say
that our hearts go out
our prayers go out
to the entire family
she really is
she was part of our family
yeah
did you know her well
not well but i did know her
and what i saw was
a hardworking young woman
with a great spirit
its just a sad day
for the campaign
and its a sad day for
those of us who know jack
governor how long has
she interned for you
uh you wanna
yeah
she had only been on the
road with us for a few weeks
maybe four weeks
i think i can check
will you be continuing
with your schedule today
yes we will most certainly
stay on schedule
seems like you have something
you wanna talk to me about
does it seem that way
if you have something
if you think you have something
you wanna get off your chest
then why dont you
how about i do the talking
and you do the listening
okay
as of tomorrow theres gonna be
a few changes to your campaign
pauls out im your
senior campaign manager
ill draft a statement
the campaign got to a point
where we needed to make changes
you can put your own words in there
why would i do that
because you wanna win
because you broke
the only rule in politics
you wanna be president
you can start a war
you can lie you can cheat
you can bankrupt the country
but you cant fuck the interns
theyll get you for that
what do you think
you have stephen
a troubled young girl tells you a story
a troubled young pregnant girl
is that what she told you
who needed cash for an abortion
what did you do
you give her money
maybe she needed cash and you
were the perfect guy to hit up
is that your best play
you need a job that bad stephen
you come in here with
your dick in your hand
you got nothing
then how did i get in here
youre right mike theres nothing
theres no voice messages no texts
no emails no pictures no tape
and yet im standing right here
yeah well go home
she left a note
how would you know that
i was cleaning up your mess
i took her phone
and i found a note
i thought it was an accident
i dont know mike
youre gonna have to tell me
youre the last person she called
note says shes pregnant
got an abortion
and doesnt wanna hurt you
then why would she leave a
note that could only do that
because shes 20
what do you want
pauls gone today
i set a meeting with you and thompson
and you promise him the ticket
you get 356 pledged delegates
you get north carolina
you take office
and you make right what so
many people have made wrong
all the things we both believe in
well i dont believe in extortion
i dont believe in tying myself
to you for the next eight years
four years
lets not get ahead of ourselves
huh
what were you
doing in her room
housekeeping
before you made page 1
no you were fired you were out
what were you doing in her room
i was fixing a situation
i got a call someone from the hotel
thought i could help and called
so you were off the campaign
but you thought it was
important to fix things
it was your voice the
other night on the phone
you were fucking her
whatd you do stephen
i lent her money and gave her a ride
i bet you did
theres no note
okay mike theres no note
show it to me
you think i brought it here
thats how people get hurt
okay lets play this out
youre not wearing a wire
because everything you suggested is illegal
and you wouldnt fare too well
in federal prison
you were fucking her
and she told you about her situation
there are no records or
conversations between the two of us
and since shes had an abortion
theres no dna evidence
so if theres no note
then its your word
against mine
your word
a fired disgruntled employee
or a sitting governor
theres no note
its your call governor
paul you got a minute
yeah
how much could a
big shakeup like this
days before the ohio primary
hurt a campaign
i asked paul zara how his firing
could actually help the candidate
the governor and i felt that
in light of these changing numbers
that it was best to put
a new face on the campaign
stephen is very talented
uh very smart
you always hear people talk
about events out of sequence
the order of things
there is no greater grief
than a parent laying
their child to rest
she was a little girl trying to make
it in a very grownup world
a world where every
mistake is magnified
and she was smart and
pretty and so so young
father you ask us
to accept gods plan
to not question his judgment
with all due respect
i dont accept this judgment
she made the world better
not just for me
but for everyone she touched
you should hire jack
for a speechwriter
ill keep it in mind
you come here to see me
no friend of the family
got her the internship
ive known her since she was born
im sorry
governor couldnt make the flight
hes meeting with thompson
look at you
all grown up with tits and all
i learned from the best
well one day well grab a beer
and you can tell me
what you had on the
governor that put me out
how do you know i didnt
have something on you
well you better get going
you have a campaign to run
ive got offices to look at
farragut north
nice consultant firm
right off of k street
million a year
no one to fuck you over
sounds relaxing
doesnt it
the right man to lead
this great nation of ours
in these challenging times
and the next president of
the united states of america
governor mike morris
we like mike
and let me ask one
very important thing
that all of us stand shoulder
to shoulder arm in arm
in a united democratic party
so i strongly urge the
356 loyal delegates
that i have carried
as a badge of honor
throw their support
to the governor
lets put this primary behind us
and get on with the business
of 1600 pennsylvania avenue
thank you god bless you
and god bless the
united states of america
governor mike morris
ladies and gentlemen
senator thompson thank you
all right mr president
well the polls arent quite closed
but i congratulate senator pullman
and his republican constituents
on their win here in ohio
senator thompson i am honored
to stand here with you today
and i am humbled by your kind words
thank you
ladies and gentlemen
today marks the beginning of a
fight between two sets of ideals
either were gonna move forward
or were going to live in the past
either were going to lead
the world again in technology
or we are going to bury
our heads in the sand
the sands of saudi arabia
the sands of iraq
either were going to let
greed and corruption
ruin our industries
and our shorelines
or we are going to
take back our country
we are not a nation
used to coming in second
or third
no its not decisive
we still have several contests to go
those states are gonna
wanna have their say
it looks like were gonna win ohio
you must concede sir
that these 356 delegates
put the pledged
delegates out of reach
the superdelegates are breaking
3 to 1 for morris
we still have several contests to go
and ohio was a big win for us
then do you have the funds
of course we have the funds
we get new donations daily
hey ben
yep
i was told to talk to you
im supposed to get a phone
and you are
jill morris
no relation
you a bearcat jill morris
no im from columbus
im a buckeye
youre making me look bad
how so
i filed the story that said
youre off the campaign and
thompsons going to pullman
cant believe
everything you read
wanna give you an opportunity
to comment on my next story
it says you delivered thompson
you got the 356 delegates
you delivered the nomination
and all you asked in
return was pauls job
any chance of you confirming
no press behind this point shes press
ill read about it in the funny papers
come on stephen
arent we friends anymore
youre my best friend ida
jay this is sean in new york
can you get him to run a mike check
if you could
count to 10 for me
one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten
good okay
senator thompson i am proud
that you have brought integrity
back to this election
because thats what this comes out
integrity
stand by
who we are
because how we project
ourselves to the world matters
dignity matters integrity matters
our future depends on it
morris morris morris
we have now governor morris
new senior campaign adviser
stephen meyers coming to us
from xavier university
where senator thompson has
just endorsed governor morris
essentially ending
