i never thought i would find
the lost city of d

and his queen s
legendary crown of fire 
and now i will be very rich 
and you will be very dead

there were just hundreds
of snakes in this temple
just waiting for us to show up 
who feeds them  you feed them 
no  what do they eat 
why is that one not biting that guy 
why is that happening 
  are they trained not to bite henchmen or something

is set for the book tour 
but  uh  the only thing we need
is a book to tour with 
i can t help but get the feeling
that you re not finishing
because you don t want
to leave your house 
listen  i know these last five years
have been hard after john s passing 
and it feels easier
to live in your bathtub 
drinking chardonnay on ice 
but  girl  there is a great
big world waiting for you
and a book tour that i can t cancel 
so just make it happen  all right 
love you  bye 
we have to keep going 
let s see what s on the
other side of that door 
but what if
there isn t anything 
there s only one way
to find out 
then love more realized
the treasure she wanted
was lost forever
and her adventures
were coming to an end 
that doesn t feel right 
yeah  but that s it 
that s the end 
well  john 
here i go 
dulcius ex as per is 
okay  honey  it s showtime 
are you sure about this 
because i have a wedgie in the
back and in the front in this thing 
i feel like
a nerdy figure skater 
sexy  stunner  i m all

  how do i move in this 
  don t touch it 
i m not touching it  i m holding

we need to remind people
that you are still alive 
people know i m alive 
and to remind them
why this used to be
the best selling franchise 
in romance 
yes  which is the top
revenue generating literary category 
revenue generating isn t how
i would describe our presales right now 
just think of this as a way
that uses word of mouth 
oh  you want word of mouth 
here we go  how s this 
 the only thing more lost than
the city is the author herself  
 loveless  
 passionless  
uh   way past her prime   and 
oh   this is fake history at its worst  
a book tour could
change everything  okay 
we have to remind the fans
why they love you so much 
real history  i merely season
it with a smidge more nudity 
history had a ton of nudity 
deep exploration 
steamy wondering 
will love more and dash find
queen taha s priceless crown of fire 
join them on their search

talk to you about something

the lost city of dash 
the lost city of d 
um  but that s not what
the d stands for 
it s d for  dick   right 
no dick  no 
it s based on the name of an ancient
tribe  dapocagihou dysphem ica 
and  um  it was too difficult for the
european colonizers to pronounce 
so  in true colonial fashion they
abbreviated it  no one cares about this 
that s so interesting 
okay

from the audience 
right here  handsome

i read you love cheese 
so i just got them all 
are you the one who s been
emailing me for photos of my feet 
no  um   
and i promise what i m about to show
you is gonna make you very happy 
but first  a little bit
about the mysterious rogue
you see before you 
uh  my name is abigail fairfax 
abigail  it s a gender neutral
name  like leslie or beverly 
yes  but you re abigail fairfax
of the media mogul fairfaxes 
didn t you just
take over your company or   
no  that was my brother  actually 
that was leslie  we re all very proud 
ah  yes  i should say so 
at such a young age to   
some might even say too young 
but that world
never really interested me 
my passions  as you may know 
lie in the hidden things
in the world 
things which defy possession 
um  some might call me
a collector 
but there is one obsession
in particular
that has held me captive 
the crown of fire
and its cascading red diamonds 
is this a    is this
a hidden camera thing 
so imagine my surprise
when  in your new book 
amidst the pages
of coital reverie 
was something   
oh  god    quite magnificent 
i get it  i get it 
i so get it right now 
oh  my gosh 
i literally thought
you guys kidnapped me 
i mean  this is marketing 
right  beth set this up 
this was so good  you guys 
this was amazing 
you  with your gun
and your mustache
and your   you d better
get in there  and you know   
oh  my god 
you  with the g i  joe
tone on tone outfit 
your fictional archaeologist was making
real translations of a dead language 
mm hmm  something nobody
else has been able to do 
well  nobody else
had ever tried 
is that right 
am i saying the right thing 
except you  right 
except me 
yes  see  it turns out
loretta sage was once a young
college girl doing her dissertation
on the dead language of the d
with her future husband 
dreaming of finding kalaman s tomb
and the crown of fire 
i was sorry to read you gave up
your search after he died 
but what that means is 
you re all i have left 
all all you have left
for    what 
hmm 
oh 
here we go 
what is this 
i believe it is describing the
exact location of kalaman s tomb 
in which taha and her
priceless headdress are buried 
well  if this were authentic 
you would still have to
uncover an entire city
that nobody
has been able to find 
i found it 
on a tiny  forgotten island
in the atlantic called isla hundida 
what i have not been able to
find is kalaman s final resting place 
this piece of parchment is the
only clue we found among the ruins 
i need someone
who can decipher these symbols 
i need you 
well    miss sage 
surely this isn t how
you want your story to end 
we both had our dreams crushed
by bad luck 
or in my case 
an arse kissing little brother 
but this is our chance
to show them all 
come with me   
to the island 
translate these symbols and
help me find the crown of fire 
you can name your price 
i must respectfully decline 
well   
i can t say
i m not disappointed 
but i understand how you feel 
will you at least let us
give you a ride 
oh  no  thank you  i ll call
for my own car  and i ll just   
i don t feel like you re listening to me 
this is urgent  and we   
okay  so the police are saying
that they put out an apb   
apb    on an suv 
and there s
this 24 hour rule    why is there a rule 
and they won t do anything until   
what about the fbi or the cia 
  they said to call the police 
  i m sure loretta s fine 
when i was in college 
my friend nicki went missing 
everyone was  like 
freaking out 
but then she was just
in her car 
she was dead  but we found her 
she wasn t gone 
um  what about   
maybe we could get a pi
or  like  you know 
private security or   
what about an extraction team 
like the movie 
yes  but who does that 
the ex military  right 
oh  yeah  i think i actually have
somebody that could help us 
  oh 
  i did this meditation retreat 
and there was this
trainer guy there 
you should
see this guy meditate 
but he s ex navy seal 
he    he s a special ops trainer 
what was his name 
yeah  jack trainer 
so he s a trainer
named jack trainer 
that s how i have everybody in
my phone  see   janice mom  
 larry doorknob  
 stacy butt stuff  
look  this is what this guy does 
he finds people 
if there s anybody
that can help us  it s him 
jack trainer 
oh  so his name is actually jack trainer 
hi  uh  this is alan
from  touching your inner self  
the meditation retreat 
anyway  uh  okay  our friend
loretta has been kidnapped 
and no one s helping us 
how long she been missing 
maybe two hours now 
who is that 
um  this is b   
this is beth  i m beth 
and allison is on too  sir 
did she have any
wi fi enabled devices 
  she s got her phone  right 
  no  i have her phone 
oh  she has a smart watch 
it ripped my wig off 
what was that scenario 
never mind  open the phone 
go to the smart watch app 
all right 
then hit  find my smart watch  
oh  my    that is so good 
that s why we called 
 anticipate the difficult
by managing the easy  
is that oprah or deepak 
laozi from tao te ching 
oh  my god 
it s in the atlantic 
  she s on a plane 
  how can you tell that 
 cause she can t swim that fast 
doesn t sound like
a ransom scenario 
my guess is blood sport 
hunger games type situation 
possibly some coke fueled
dark web scavenger hunt 
real clown shit 
we ll have to move fast 
  how do we pay you 
  cryptocurrency  cash app 
i ll have her back within 48 hours
or your next rescue is free 
how many people
need a next rescue 
more than you d think 
  i m gonna need that phone 
  i ll bring it to you 
let me know where she lands 
i ll meet you there  alan 
hello 
where am i 
um  you re on my plane 
it s nice  isn t it  hmm 
the seats are made of
mama llama leather 
well  i m getting off
your plane 
unchain me 
that s your seat belt 
did you chloroform me 
people actually do that 
well  you know 
it s a classic for a reason 
my body feels drunk 
it ll wear off in a bit 
i am sorry 
i just couldn t wait around
for you to change your mind 
stop playing jelly 
time is not on our side 
you see  the volcano
we re excavating around
has developed
a bad case of indigestion 
i m rather worried
that when it blows 
everything that s left
of the lost city will be destroyed 
oh  my god 
my legs don t work 
so  this is our last chance to
find both the tomb and the crown 
  oh  god 
  oh 
don t worry 
that s just our final descent 
but it is the beginning of the
greatest adventure of your life 
welcome to the lost city 
how did you find it 
so  the city was built
on a lava dome 
as the volcano became active 
the dome filled with lava 
and sunken things
rose to the surface 
the d exposed itself 
  the entire city 
  no  no  just the tip 
as soon as i heard rumors of the
ruins  i flew over and bought the place 
the site  no  the
island  the southern half 
i got a good deal
 cause this is where the lava flows 
we ve been excavating
for a year now 
one doesn t kidnap a
romance novelist on day one 
ah  yes  as the saying goes 
rafi doesn t like it 
do you  rafi 
he says
we re disrespecting his heritage 
but not a lot of other job options
on the island  are there  rafi 
beggars can t be choosers 
no more charcuterie  i take it 
mmm  please 
i m not a monster 
whatever you need  just shout 
uh  leave one hand free 
she has some translating to do 
and then what 
loretta  i really wish
you would try and see
what an exciting opportunity
this is for us 
i believe this text describes
the exact location of the tomb 
it s a logographic system 
like cuneiform or hieroglyphics 
now  if you have other documents
that possibly i can compare   
yeah  no luck there 
we found some scratching
at a nearby waterfall 
but it was useless 
just pictures of women 
look  i  too  wish your dear
old dead archaeologist husband
was here to help 
but he s not  so 
time to shine  loretta 
sex book writer 
they will come for me 
who  exactly 
your    your many cats 
oh  i don t have cats 
somehow even more sad 
i have a hamster  asshole 
you have a hamster s asshole 
no  there was a    there was
a comma between    forget it 
i bet your brother never had
to kidnap anyone 
  from the dusty mesa  
  her looming shadow grows  
  hidden in the branches  
  of the poison creosote  
good to see you  man 
phone 
right 
what 
yeah  i was thinking
that i could  you know 
maybe just sort of
come with you 
why 
to help 
i know cpr  i know some
light karate  crossfit certified 
okay  okay  listen  listen 
i just    it s my fault 
not the kidnapping and stuff 
but  like  i said some really
mean stuff to her  and i regret it 
and i just need to take it back 
i called her a human mummy 
mummies are human 
i m aware of that now  yes 
that is true 
please 
all right  alan 
i can t be responsible for you 
okay  yeah 
i need you to stay in the car 
yeah 
in the car 
in the car 
the whole time 
the whole time 
whole time 
mm hmm 
yes 
this is me 
really  is this what
the seal teams use 
 only a fool chooses a horse
by its color  
right  right 
the tao te ching 
no  it was on the sign
back there at the rental place 
thank you 
  i once had a life
or rather  life had me  
  i was one among many  
  or at least i seemed to be  
  well  i read an old quotation
in a book just yesterday  
  said
 gonna reap just what you sow  
  the debts you make
you have to pay   
  can you get to that   
what  what 
i was hoping to invite you
to breakfast 
but it looks like
you still have work to do 
uh  wait  wait  wait 
wait  wait  wait  wait 
i believe this says
 rest  or  resting  
so it would be 
 kalaman and his treasure    
and then there are some missing
pieces  and then  rest    resting  
and something about
 tears   so   
resting where 
hmm  oh 
didn t say 
it doesn t say 
miss sage 
i need you to do better 
then next time maybe don t
kidnap a romance novelist  hmm 
my god 
this shouldn t be this hard 
it is not some pauper s grave
we re looking for 
it is a monument to a great man 
king kalaman was ambitious 
he was powerful 
he was the first man
to build a city in the atlantic 
the eyes of his subjects
would have turned to him 
he would have had a pyramid 
a ziggurat  a tower
to hold his crown of fire 
all i need to know
is where it is 
i don t know if you recall 
but you only said translate it 
i i translated it 
translate it again 
one day  we re gonna
laugh about this 
such an adventure we re having 
i should go with you 
just for backup and awesomeness 
this is pretty awesome 
you got nature  the radio 
yeah  you re right 
but it s very  very important to me
that she knows
that i came to rescue her 
why 
do you like this woman 
no  i just brought snacks
and stuff 
and she gets a little grumpy
when she s hungry 
blood pressure drops  and i get that
because i m a five meal a day kind of guy 
do you keto  by the way 
you look like you keto 
no 
no  yeah 
you don t need it 
what is it 
i just want her to think of me
as more than a cover model 
but  alan  you are so much
more  you re my lookout 
okay  can i at least do the part
where i put her in the car
and i just go 
 shh  you re safe now

she ll love that 
oh  you re just going 
going to start 
you re starting
the mission now  okay 
oh 
go to sleep 
  take a little walk
to the edge of town  
  and go across the tracks  
  where the viaduct looms
like a bird of doom  
  as it shifts and cracks  
  where secrets lie in the
border fires in the humming wires  
  hey  man  you know
you re never coming back  
  past the square
past the bridge  
  past the mills
past the stacks  
alan 
what

  a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat  
stay close  stay alive 
hey

for  catch

you say   here  
i toss you a sweatshirt 
you say   here  
i toss you a pen 
how  bout just 
 hey  catch  gun  
anything that you want to throw 
i ll catch it because you said   catch  
and i ll catch it
because you said it 
that is also an option  and then
we would have a gun with us 
that s a thing 
be careful 
okay  we need to call   
be careful 
we need to call for help 
get to the airport and get out of here 
and i am driving 
okay 
oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh 
okay  call for   
call for help 
where s your phone 
okay 
  tell me you caught them 
  i tagged the blond one 
oh  loretta 
what are you thinking 
you might ve killed one of them 
but his partner s still with her 
and he is clearly skilled 
highly trained
and very dangerous 
so  miss sage said
she was gonna leave the event 
then got in a car
and left the event 
  did you try calling her 
  she doesn t have her phone 
stolen phone 
didn t say that 
where s my magnifier 
listen  can you please
help with nana 
i don t want her hearing about
loretta  cause it s going to upset her 
  what about loretta 
  nothing  nana  she just went on a trip 
  good 
  yeah 
that girl needed
to get out of the house 
so  this is the thing  loretta s
phone is not stolen  i took it 
i gave it to alan  alan then gave
it to the trainer  uh  jack trainer 
and that is how we found
her wearable 
  and who s alan 
  dash 
  what s that 
  he s the hero in all of her books 
  nana  hey  slut 
  mm mmm 
let s go in the other room and talk
about whichever war you lived through 
okay  come on  it ll be fun 
i m sorry  it ll be fun 
listen  loretta sage is missing 
when i looked at her smart watch 
it said that she had flown
to some island
i ve never even heard about 
that means y all need
to do something about this 
and if you can t  i will 
and that won t look good for you 
pretty sure that s
outside our jurisdiction 
  you d have to call the feds 
  okay 
and if you do go to the feds 
put in a good word for me 
for me 
for us 
oh  oh 
what are you gonna do 
put the car back together 
well    we could   
where did you say the phone was 
passenger glove 
what 
passenger glove compartment 
goodness 
oh  my god 
oh  my god  no phone  no car 
we re so gonna die out   
here 
what is this 
boots for the jungle 
it s not exactly
hiking boots  but   
i figured your feet would be killing
you after wearing heels for this long 
it was the best we could do 
they re allison s  sorry 
oh  okay  well  thank you 
here  oh  i got you cheese 
oh  my god 
you got to stay hydrated 
thank you so much 
they didn t have glass bottles 
so we ll definitely
hold onto it and recycle 
okay  so what we need to do is find a
phone  we need to call the authorities 
and we need to wait here until
somebody comes and rescues us 
uh    this   
this is the rescue 
no one else is coming 
i m sorry 
i m the rescue 
it was originally just gonna be me 
then i was like  trainer should come 
oh  trainer  rest in peace 
so  our best bet is to get to the
airport  see this road right here 
from this area  just take a shortcut
through the jungle to the road 
did you just say  shortcut
through the jungle  
yeah 
okay  do you see us 
uh huh  you are not dash 
and i m not love more  okay 
i m loretta  and you are alan 
and jungles eat people
like us  okay  eat people 
and i don t want to mess up the jumpsuit 
it s on loan  so we re gonna stay put 
we re not just gonna
stand around here  okay 
we re gonna go
through the jungle 
we re gonna go to the airport
and find a phone 
  so you can have your cake and get what you want 
   and eat it too  
if that s what you want to do
with your cake  fine  let s go 
  that s the only thing you do with cake 
  not mine 
i don t know what your
people do  but my people eat it 
you could give it
to someone as a gift 
those people
are still going to eat the cake 
everybody eats cake 
what about the kind
people jump out of 
they don t eat it  when they re in it 
oh  my god 
what did they
kidnap you for anyhow 
is it some weird sex stuff
like taken 
oh  my god  thank you 
i thought so too  but the guy s
one of the fairfaxes 
beverly

vlog on finding montezuma s treasure

crown of fire  like the one

 lovemore s hands
explored the    
the contoured scenery
of dash s body 
familiar terrain made
new and exciting with every   
 with every scarlet rim  
and that didn t  uh   
didn t turn her off 
no 
 because with every
cardinal ridge 
love more discovered
another letter in the language
 that only their bodies spoke  
and what were
their bodies saying 
 take me    
take me 
 take me  
how s that

good job  loretta 
boss  come on 
people are dying now 
don t you think that maybe
this has all gone too far

i am on the cusp
of attaining the unattainable 
something singular 
something no nation 
no emperor  no brown no sing
brothers ever have 
the legendary crown of fire 
so  yes 
yes  i would definitely say
it s worth it 
excuse me 
excuse me  sir  i need to get

i also like steak 
would you like to  maybe 
i don t know   
  maybe there s a   
  no   lives are at stake  
i need to go
to the island tonight 
ah 
yes 
even more serious 
extremely 
well  i believe that i may be able
to assist you 
i have a cargo plane 
maybe after i make my delivery 
we could swing by your island 
i m about to ask you something 
and you better tell me the truth 
have you ever
murdered anyone before 
no 
i don t know if i really buy it 
but let me tell you something 
if you ever think about murdering
me  i promise  i will murder you first 
my pleasure 
you are weird  let s go 
 king kalaman and his treasure
laid to rest in the well
of endless tears  
what is that 
oh  it s a    it s a thing 
i mean  it s not  uh   
you know  it s not
what you think it is 
so it s not fairfax s fragment
of an ancient parchment 
okay 
it s what you think it is 
loretta  i thought
you were smarter than that 
fairfax is never
gonna stop hunting us now 
what were you thinking 
we have a volcano
that could bury the tomb
before we get to it  before we see
it  before we preserve its memory 
this is    i m sorry 
is that what we re doing 
 cause no one told me 
when were you gonna tell me 
why would i tell you 
we re in this together 
i came here to rescue you 
you know you re not dash  right 
you don t ride in on a
white horse to rescue people 
you    spray yourself with bronzer
and you stand in front of wind machines 
which is great for you 
how would you have any idea
what i m actually like 
i know you  you re
a pretty open book  alan 
  okay  then who am i 
  really 
yeah 
o    okay  uh   
you were a homecoming king and
you coasted on your good looks to la 
but then realized that being the most
handsome kid in the middle of nowhere
doesn t mean
you re going to be a star 
until one day  when a woman
who couldn t publish her book
on spanish colonization in the atlantic
decided to write a romance novel 
uh  chose you at random
to be on the cover 
lucky for you and her 
the novels were a smashing success 
she kept writing her schlock 
you kept posing 
um  you know  neither one of us
becoming who we d hoped we would be 
uh  and then one day 
we both die in the jungle
on one of those atlantic islands
i wrote about all those years ago 
right 
mm hmm 
it was sarasota  by the way 
it s not nowhere 
i grew up there with
my mom and two sisters 
and yeah   
i started modeling
 cause i wanted to get away 
it was the only job
that i could think of
that could take me to all of the places
that i always dreamed of going 
then finally to los angeles 
where i posed on the cover
of your romance novel 
and i was so embarrassed that
one of my friends might ve seen me
in that wig
on the cover of your book
that i avoided talking to them
for months 
and then one day 
i m walking home 
and i hear this lady yell 
 dash  
she runs up  and she is so happy 
then i thought 
 how could i be this embarrassed
about something
that makes people this happy  
loretta  you can do
whatever you want 
if you don t want to
write anymore  don t write 
but don t minimize the people that
love your work by calling it schlock 
that s not fair to them 
you know what s ironic  i thought
you of all people would know
not to judge a book
by its cover 
judge a book by its cover model 
alan 
alan 
there s two of them 
loretta  i m over here 
alan 
alan  motorcycles and guns 
motorcycles and guns 
come on  this way 
stop shooting 
just give  em the parchment 
i can t 
yes  you can  actually  you just
say   here   and throw it at  em 
right  and then i m sure
they ll happily let us go 
okay  keep down 
how do they keep finding us 
you re basically a walking disco ball 
we need to come up with a plan 
i have an idea 
we re gonna dig a hole 
throw our voices 
 we re over here  
can you sound like a bird 
no  i have a plan 
alan  please  i m thinking 
i know  but i have a plan 
please  just let me think about   
wait a minute  they re shooting at
you  yeah  that s why we re hiding 
no  no  no  no 
they re shooting only at you 
they won t shoot me 
it s my brain that s valuable 
what  i don t think you actually
hear the things you say sometimes 
maybe i can shield you 
you are not shielding me 
i should be shielding you 
why  because i m a woman 
that s supremely sexist  well  look  i
don t think using women as human shields
is exactly the change that
gloria seinfeld had in mind  do you 
gloria steinem  whatever 
her too  you know what  fine 
please mansplain sexism to me
right now  oh  my god  i am a woman 
i can t mansplain anything 
uh  i m a feminist  and i think a
woman can do anything a man can do 
we just need to stay here until
they get tired  i have an idea 
please can i tell you my plan 
alan 
this is not a situation you can get
out of by ripping your shirt off 
not my shirt 
three 
  yes 
  oh 
oh 
that was different
than i had in my head 
i just wanted us to stop them  could it
have been the wind that made it do that 
no  i think it was us 
i think    we did it 
we did the one guy  right 
but that was  like   
we just wanted him to stop  but i
think the other guy could ve moved  really 
so  that was   
that one was on him 
even if we weren t here 
that could ve happened 
why are you gonna stop
next to a cliff 
they were wearing helmets 
so maybe they re   
but the rest of their body
didn t have a helmet 
so there d just be a head 
they were driving
recklessly  right 
don t be mean on a bike 
don t do mean stuff on a bike 
i mean  perhaps they re fine 
yeah  probably not 
but that s okay 
that s all right  you know 
things happen  let s go 
  you gonna put it back together 
  it s on loan 
look at me 
okay 
what more can i do  you know 
you ve done so much already 
beth 
my poor  sweet  little nana
has lost her sight 
the book release
is a complete disaster 
which i ve leveraged
everything on 
so i m probably  most definitely
broke right now 
and most importantly 
i ve lost a writer 
who does that 
who loses a writer 
okay  beth  you remind me
of my best friend  randy 
always looking out
for other people 
never taking care of herself 
isn t that right  randy 
she s like my therapist 
this one over here 
lol   laughing out loud  
after you take care
of your friend 
how about we go to a beach 
what 
look  i have a pickup in hawaii 
she doesn t have to come 
okay  okay  you can come 
she s hilarious 
let me ask you something 
we re all sitting here chitchatting 
but who s flying the plane 
autopilot

okay 
i m going to go land the plane 
okay 
no  no  no  take the goat 
please  take the goat 
she s on break

hi

hey  it s beth  please leave a
message  and i ll get right back to you 
uh  hi  beth

oh  here comes alan 
i ll call you back 
so  uh  police
are searching for fairfax 
and they re gonna provide us
protection while we re here 
did they say
how long we d be here 
they re gonna try to get us on a
puddle jumper later this evening 
but  uh  they said in the
meantime  the inn is really nice 
and we can get cleaned up
and maybe a change of clothes 
okay 
okay  yeah 
thank you 
come on 
dance with your husband 
no  no  no 
he s not my husband 
  it s okay 
  dance with him 
no  no  she doesn t want to 
she doesn t have the right shoes 
actually  it s the only thing
these shoes are right for 
you don t have to do this 
it s okay  it s okay 
yeah 
i wonder what she s saying 
it s folklore 
love song about a woman
whose lover died  and she
didn t want to leave his side 
so she laid down
and refused to get up 
must be scary 
having to face your future without
the person that you planned it with 
what was that 
excuse me  excuse me  the 
um    the last line that you sang 
 quién llorará junto a mí 
 the island will weep for me
in the well of endless tears  
what is that  the well of endless
tears  is that a real place  or   
sinkhole place 
thank you  gracias  gracias 
come here  come here 
what is it 
hey  on the parchment  it said 
 king kalaman and his treasure
laid to rest in the well of endless tears  
i thought
maybe it was a metaphor 
it s not 
the well of endless tears
is a place 
it s a sinkhole 
there s a sinkhole on the map 
i think the tomb is there 
this is so much better
than your books  what 
there s like   
no  i don t mean any offense 
i m kidding  i m kidding 
it s  like  equal 
i m kidding  i m kidding  look
at you  you want to go there 
what  no 
i can see  yes  you do 
that would be insane  that
would be insane  i just    i just   
it s just that we re so close to it 
but  you know  we can t   
no 
this is your story 
how do you want to write it 
i d like to know
that it s there 
that all this meant something 
okay  then let s go 
we ll stay one more day 
as soon as the sun s up 
we re gonna go find
the well of endless tears 
but what if it s nothing 
so what  then we say we tried 
and fairfax 
the cops are after fairfax 
don t worry about him 
this is crazy 
yeah  but look at you 
what 
it s the very first time i ve ever
seen you totally unafraid 
and alive 
i m gonna go tell them our plans
have changed and find us a ride 
where are you going 
i see you met my friend here 
he told me you were just
about to jump on a plane 
without so much as
saying goodbye 
i said   no way 
not my loretta 
not when she s the only one
who can lead me to the tomb  
stop squeezing so hard 
ow  get your hands off of me 
ow  let go 
i i need a car 
a car  an auto 
does anybody have an auto 
no  no  no 
i i i need an auto 
i ll trade you my watch 
it s a really expensive watch 
do you have a car 
it s a bulgari 
this thing glows in the dark 
it s waterproof 
i have motorcycle 
cool  isn t it 
i always thought  why can t your
personal tank also have a minibar 
have a drink 
do you mind 
uh  yes 
he has a bit of a grudge
against you  i m afraid 
something about a motorbike
accident his friends had 
why are you doing this 
i want something
nobody else has 
when my father gifted   
as i was saying 
when my father gifted his empire
to my baby brother   
who is that 
is that a ken doll on a moped 
i know him from somewhere 
oh  i i i doubt that 
because what you are looking at
is a highly trained
combat specialist 
forged in the furnaces
of afghanistan  iraq 
kuwait  sa    sarasota   
incredible skin 
no eczema problems 
and he will not stop
until i am safe 
so you pull
this space tank over 
unless you would like to perish
like his friends did 
and he is responsible
for their perishment 
he might not have meant to 
but they    perished  so   
okay  who who is this 
i have seen him
somewhere before 
no  no  no 
that s your cover model 
isn t it 
yes  i knew
i knew him from somewhere 
get up there 
and kill him creatively 
i love watching hunks fail 
i guess i i will
have that drink 
oh  shit 
is it okay
if i just top  er off 
yeah  that s fine  but   
oh  my god 
have you used a glass before 
sorry 
what would jack trainer do 
it s hot in here 
anyone else feeling
how hot it is 
are you trying to be sexy 
this is very weird 
please  stop 
i could set your world on fire 
go to sleep  go to sleep 
go to sleep  sleep 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
time out 
time in 
no  don t shoot her 
i need her 
oh  jesus 
ow  ow  ow 
move your foot  move your foot 
go to sleep  asshole 
get out there  look 
a bigger guy 
oh  no 
what 
move it 
no  no  no  no  no  no 
hey  get in 
him or me 
this is not one of your cheap  vapid
lady fantasy books  loretta 
this is real life 
and we will kill him 
tell us where the tomb is 
hi 
so  whoever s in charge 
i need you to send
officials to go here 
here 
we are closed 
you re closed 
you know i ve been trying to take
a nap for a year and a half 
a year and a half 
i have been burning the candle
at both ends 
the midnight oil 
since way before
my friend got kidnapped 
and all i want to do
is kick my feet back
and drink some wine
that i m probably
too tired to drink 
and i want a massage 
i want someone to massage
my shoulders and my feet 
and i want it at the same time 
and i don t care if logistically
that doesn t make sense 
because i have worked hard 
the same way that
i know that you have 
so i hate to ask you
to leave this place open
a few more minutes 
because if we don t 
a very close friend of mine
and her cover model
are going to die 
no good way in  boss 
what about the caves 
that s too dangerous 
well 
we ll be very careful then 
well  come on 
  this way 
  i have a rule about
not going into
super creepy caves 
  julian 
  his name is julian 
he seems more like
a buck or a bruce 
lead the way 
go on  don t be scared 
watch your step there 
bruce 
julian  oh  no 
julian 
whoa 
whoa 
well   
let s not have
his death be in vain 
  onward and upward 
  what do you mean onward 
we re not gonna go
and get him now  are we 
oh  man 
  it s nothing 
  okay 
yeah  look  let s just
go back to the boat 
this is over 
nobody else has to die 
no  no  no  ha ha 
it s a breeze 
there s a tunnel 
this could lead to the tomb 
that s not person sized 
ah  speak for yourself 
come on 
it s practically a kiddie slide 
more like a rock sphincter 
or a troll anus 
all right  well  you are
going through the anus   
the hole    the tunnel 
why her 
you are our canary in the coal mine 
no  that s impossible 
i can t 
please let us know
if you get through 
if we don t hear from you 
fabio s got to die 
wait 
i m the damsel in distress 
it s okay  i m fine 
i can t 
i m so sorry  i can t 
  hey 
  what 
hey  you smell that 
you mean centuries worth of bat
feces  yes  i definitely smell that 
you gotta take
a big breath for me 
there you go 
you can do it  loretta 
i think i see a way out 
oh  cheese and rice 
i made it 
i made it 
see  totally safe 
go on  your turn 
i m coming through 
be right there  okay 
why would they build this here 
but how is anyone
supposed to worship
or remember you
if they can t even see it 
they aren t 
this isn t a monument
to kalaman s power 
it s a hiding place
for a grieving woman 
taha came here
to be with her fallen lover 
she just wanted to be alone 
taha doesn t want us here 
god  shut up  rafi 
it s just the volcano 
come on 
we have to keep going 
all right 
let s go  muscles 
open it up 
  don t disturb them 
  she will be wearing the headdress 
come on  we didn t come all
this way just to pay our respects 
i can t  um   
uh    i m sorry  abuela 
what is that 
are those    seashells 
the crown is made of seashells 
where s the treasure 
she s holding him 
you mean the dead guy 
look 
it s their courtship 
kalaman is searching the island
for something 
rare red seashells 
to prove his love  he gave her
one shell every day for a year
and made them into a crown 
bright red like
the flame of their love 
until the day came
where she accepted his proposal 
it was never about jewels 
kalaman and taha s riches
weren t material 
it was their love 
that s what it meant 
that was enough 
so that s it 
all of that time and money
spent on  what 
just a cheap metaphor 
it s a pretty rich metaphor 
oh  shut up 
we got to go  we got to go now 
  come on  let s go 
  no  no  no  you are staying here 
you think it s all
so sweet and poetic 
well  then you can stay here
and spend your last moments
pondering the richness
of that metaphor 
  get in 
  what  come on  man 
  oh  god  just get in  get in the tomb 
  okay  okay 
it s better to be buried alive
than buried dead  i guess 
  it s really not 
  you know  it is a shame  really 
this is a hell of a story 
pity you won t be around
to tell it  come on 
  but they ll die 
  so will you
if you don t stop being such a snowflake 
get over here 
this is fine 
this is not an active nightmare
i ve had since
i was 14 years old 
ow 
why are you going so fast 
it s not a race 
wait  no  what are you doing 
come back here 
you may have bought the island 
but now the island owns you 
you can t just leave me here 
rafi  come back 
i need a boat 
hey  hey  stop  stop 
help  help 
one of the locals
just stole my boat 
have you seen a woman 
she s a brunette
in a sequined jumpsuit 
no  is she in some sort
of trouble 
it s kind of funny 
i used to think this   
this sort of thing
was so romantic 
yeah 
being locked in a coffin
about to be buried by lava 
or    cuddling dead people 
just laying down
with a lost love 
like taha did 
god 
oh   
oh  god 
i m sorry 
i m sorry that
i couldn t save you 
i m sorry i couldn t be dash 
you re right 
you re nothing like dash 
you didn t ride in on a
white horse to save me 
you rode in on a   
borrowed scooter with a broken muffler 
yeah 
i never could ve written
a dash like you 
 cause i never knew
a dash like alan 
i was so afraid
of being hurt by life again
that i just stopped living 
couldn t see the good things
in front of me 
i m just so sorry
i didn t see you sooner 
i have a confession too 
see  i was really liking where this
new story of ours was headed 
i just wanted to see how
it was gonna turn out  i guess 
the adventures
of loretta and alan 
no  it would need
a better title than that 
yeah  definitely 
definitely 
sorry  just   
taha s femur is poking me 
rafi must have left that 
how do you forget your crowbar 
it s gonna help us escape 
no  he left it on purpose 
oh  cool  i always liked him 
one    okay 
two  three 
okay 
i would ve preferred him to not leave us
here in the first place  but   
okay 
dulcius ex as per is 
sweeter after difficulty 
go up 
run for the trees 
wait  nope  never mind 
trees are on fire 
okay 
we can go back
through the tunnel 
nope  tunnel s a no go 
um  okay 
i m open to other ideas 
there s a current 
we can follow it into the ocean 
how do we know
what s on the other side 
we don t 
there s only one way
to find out 
worth the rash 
yeah 
alan

 finding refuge
on a nearby rock 
he lifted her from the water 
his powerful arms
pulling her body close 
alan whispered    
shh  you re safe now 
 in that moment  loretta could feel
a new adventure was just beginning  
 the heart pounding passion
of the narrow escape
only inflamed loretta s
desire for him 
she was thirsty for the hot lava
soon to be pulsing from his    
don t you go stopping
right at the good part 
it s nothing she hasn t
read before 
didn t i tell you 
the most beautiful beach
in the world

because he really likes her  
it s nice writing 
thanks

 he looked deep in her eyes  
the only thing that could compare
to the pulse of that ocean
 was the throbbing in the    
okay  no  you can t throb 
why not 
can t come out of the gate
with a throb 
you throb all the time 
i don t come out of the gate with it 
you have to earn the throb 
who made you the queen of throb 
it s usually a chapter four thing  you
want it brought up appropriately in four

 pulsating  
it s a precursor to throb 
 undulating
