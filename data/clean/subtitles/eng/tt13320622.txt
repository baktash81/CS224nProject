all thanks
to your brute strength dash
and your knowledge
of ancient aramaic mathematics
please this has nothing to do
with my two doctorates
and my masters
in gender studies
and everything to do
with you dr love more
the truth is
i never thought i would find
the lost city of d
i would choose your
words carefully
they will be your last
you led me right
to king kalamans tomb
and his queens
legendary crown of fire
and now i will be very rich
and you will be very dead
hold up are these
are these your snakes
no they were just here
there were just hundreds
of snakes in this temple
just waiting for us to show up
who feeds them you feed them
no what do they eat
why is that one not biting that guy
why is that happening
are they trained not to bite henchmen or something
yeah well
i mean the snaketotemple
ratio alone

a story to write
delete
hey its me beth
i dont want to pull the whole
im your publisher card but i am
and im really looking forward
to seeing this last chapter
but no pressure
no there actually is pressure
the exact amount of pressure that
motivates you but doesnt paralyze you
you got this
thank you
me again
okay so everything
is set for the book tour
but uh the only thing we need
is a book to tour with
i cant help but get the feeling
that youre not finishing
because you dont want
to leave your house
listen i know these last five years
have been hard after johns passing
and it feels easier
to live in your bathtub
drinking chardonnay on ice
but girl there is a great
big world waiting for you
and a book tour that i cant cancel
so just make it happen all right
love you bye
we have to keep going
lets see whats on the
other side of that door
but what if
there isnt anything
theres only one way
to find out
then love more realized
the treasure she wanted
was lost forever
and her adventures
were coming to an end
that doesnt feel right
yeah but thats it
thats the end
well john
here i go
dulcius ex as per is
okay honey its showtime
are you sure about this
because i have a wedgie in the
back and in the front in this thing
i feel like
a nerdy figure skater
sexy stunner im all
about it no its not its not
how do i move in this
dont touch it
im not touching it im holding
it out stop it will you stop
get it out now
cause you cant do that onstage
and were done

everyones wearing
sequins right now

shawnmendes
gaggingtomeetyouall
okay we are having fun
lets go
we need to remind people
that you are still alive
people know im alive
and to remind them
why this used to be
the best selling franchise
in romance
yes which is the top
revenuegenerating literary category
revenuegenerating isnt how
i would describe our presales right now
just think of this as a way
that uses word of mouth
oh you want word of mouth
here we go hows this
the only thing more lost than
the city is the author herself
loveless
passionless
uh way past her prime and
oh this is fake history at its worst
a book tour could
change everything okay
we have to remind the fans
why they love you so much
real history i merely season
it with a smidge more nudity
history had a ton of nudity
deep exploration
steamy wondering
will love more and dash find
queen tahas priceless crown of fire
join them on their search
so listen i wanted to
talk to you about something

i read you love cheese
so i just got them all
are you the one whos been
emailing me for photos of my feet
no um
and i promise what im about to show
you is gonna make you very happy
but first a little bit
about the mysterious rogue
you see before you
uh my name is abigail fairfax
abigail its a genderneutral
name like leslie or beverly
yes but youre abigail fairfax
of the mediamogul fairfaxes
didnt you just
take over your company or
no that was my brother actually
that was leslie were all very proud
ah yes i should say so
at such a young age to
some might even say too young
but that world
never really interested me
my passions as you may know
lie in the hidden things
in the world
things which defy possession
um some might call me
a collector
but there is one obsession
in particular
that has held me captive
the crown of fire
and its cascading red diamonds
is this a is this
a hiddencamera thing
so imagine my surprise
when in your new book
amidst the pages
of coital reverie
was something
oh god quite magnificent
i get it i get it
i so get it right now
oh my gosh
i literally thought
you guys kidnapped me
i mean this is marketing
right beth set this up
this was so good you guys
this was amazing
you with your gun
and your mustache
and your youd better
get in there and you know
oh my god
you with the gi joe
toneontone outfit
your fictional archaeologist was making
real translations of a dead language
mmhmm something nobody
else has been able to do
well nobody else
had ever tried
is that right
am i saying the right thing
except you right
except me
yes see it turns out
loretta sage was once a young
college girl doing her dissertation
on the dead language of the d
with her future husband
dreaming of finding kalamans tomb
and the crown of fire
i was sorry to read you gave up
your search after he died
but what that means is
youre all i have left
allall you have left
for what
hmm
oh
here we go
what is this
i believe it is describing the
exact location of kalamans tomb
in which taha and her
priceless headdress are buried
well if this were authentic
you would still have to
uncover an entire city
that nobody
has been able to find
i found it
on a tiny forgotten island
in the atlantic called isla hundida
what i have not been able to
find is kalamans final resting place
this piece of parchment is the
only clue we found among the ruins
i need someone
who can decipher these symbols
i need you
well miss sage
surely this isnt how
you want your story to end
we both had our dreams crushed
by bad luck
or in my case
an arsekissing little brother
but this is our chance
to show them all
come with me
to the island
translate these symbols and
help me find the crown of fire
you can name your price
i must respectfully decline
well
i cant say
im not disappointed
but i understand how you feel
will you at least let us
give you a ride
oh no thank you ill call
for my own car and ill just
i dont feel like youre listening to me
this is urgent and we
okay so the police are saying
that they put out an apb
apb on an suv
and theres
this 24hour rule why is there a rule
and they wont do anything until
what about the fbi or the cia
they said to call the police
im sure lorettas fine
when i was in college
my friend nicki went missing
everyone was like
freaking out
but then she was just
in her car
she was dead but we found her
she wasnt gone
um what about
maybe we could get a pi
or like you know
private security or
what about an extraction team
like the movie
yes but who does that
the exmilitary right
oh yeah i think i actually have
somebody that could help us
oh
i did this meditation retreat
and there was this
trainer guy there
you should
see this guy meditate
but hes exnavy seal
he hes a special ops trainer
what was his name
yeah jack trainer
so hes a trainer
named jack trainer
thats how i have everybody in
my phone see janice mom
larry doorknob
stacy butt stuff
look this is what this guy does
he finds people
if theres anybody
that can help us its him
jack trainer
oh so his name is actually jack trainer
hi uh this is alan
from touching your inner self
the meditation retreat
anyway uh okay our friend
loretta has been kidnapped
and no ones helping us
how long she been missing
maybe two hours now
who is that
um this is b
this is beth im beth
and allison is on too sir
did she have any
wifienabled devices
shes got her phone right
no i have her phone
oh she has a smart watch
it ripped my wig off
what was that scenario
never mind open the phone
go to the smart watch app
all right
then hit find my smart watch
oh my that is so good
thats why we called
anticipate the difficult
by managing the easy
is that oprah or deepak
laozi from taote ching
oh my god
its in the atlantic
shes on a plane
how can you tell that
cause she cant swim that fast
doesnt sound like
a ransom scenario
my guess is blood sport
hunger games type situation
possibly some cokefueled
dark web scavenger hunt
real clown shit
well have to move fast
how do we pay you
cryptocurrency cash app
ill have her back within 48 hours
or your next rescue is free
how many people
need a next rescue
more than youd think
im gonna need that phone
ill bring it to you
let me know where she lands
ill meet you there alan
hello
where am i
um youre on my plane
its nice isnt it hmm
the seats are made of
mama llama leather
well im getting off
your plane
unchain me
thats your seat belt
did you chloroform me
people actually do that
well you know
its a classic for a reason
my body feels drunk
itll wear off in a bit
i am sorry
i just couldnt wait around
for you to change your mind
stop playing jelly
time is not on our side
you see the volcano
were excavating around
has developed
a bad case of indigestion
im rather worried
that when it blows
everything thats left
of the lost city will be destroyed
oh my god
my legs dont work
so this is our last chance to
find both the tomb and the crown
oh god
oh
dont worry
thats just our final descent
but it is the beginning of the
greatest adventure of your life
welcome to the lost city
how did you find it
so the city was built
on a lava dome
as the volcano became active
the dome filled with lava
and sunken things
rose to the surface
the d exposed itself
the entire city
no no just the tip
as soon as i heard rumors of the
ruins i flew over and bought the place
the site no the
island the southern half
i got a good deal
cause this is where the lava flows
weve been excavating
for a year now
one doesnt kidnap a
romance novelist on day one
ah yes as the saying goes
rafi doesnt like it
do you rafi
he says
were disrespecting his heritage
but not a lot of other job options
on the island are there rafi
beggars cant be choosers
no more charcuterie i take it
mmm please
im not a monster
whatever you need just shout
uh leave one hand free
she has some translating to do
and then what
loretta i really wish
you would try and see
what an exciting opportunity
this is for us
i believe this text describes
the exact location of the tomb
its a logographic system
like cuneiform or hieroglyphics
now if you have other documents
that possibly i can compare
yeah no luck there
we found some scratching
at a nearby waterfall
but it was useless
just pictures of women
look i too wish your dear
old dead archaeologist husband
was here to help
but hes not so
time to shine loretta
sexbook writer
they will come for me
who exactly
your your many cats
oh i dont have cats
somehow even more sad
i have a hamster asshole
you have a hamsters asshole
no there was a there was
a comma between forget it
i bet your brother never had
to kidnap anyone
from the dusty mesa
her looming shadow grows
hidden in the branches
of the poison creosote
good to see you man
phone
right
what
yeah i was thinking
that i could you know
maybe just sort of
come with you
why
to help
i know cpr i know some
light karate crossfit certified
okay okay listen listen
i just its my fault
not the kidnapping and stuff
but like i said some really
mean stuff to her and i regret it
and i just need to take it back
i called her a human mummy
mummies are human
im aware of that now yes
that is true
please
all right alan
i cant be responsible for you
okay yeah
i need you to stay in the car
yeah
in the car
in the car
the whole time
the whole time
whole time
mmhmm
yes
this is me
really is this what
the seal teams use
only a fool chooses a horse
by its color
right right
the taote ching
no it was on the sign
back there at the rental place
thank you
i once had a life
or rather life had me
i was one among many
or at least i seemed to be
well i read an old quotation
in a book just yesterday
said
gonna reap just what you sow
the debts you make
you have to pay
can you get to that
what what
i was hoping to invite you
to breakfast
but it looks like
you still have work to do
uh wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait
i believe this says
rest or resting
so it would be
kalaman and his treasure
and then there are some missing
pieces and then rest resting
and something about
tears so
resting where
hmm oh
didnt say
it doesnt say
miss sage
i need you to do better
then next time maybe dont
kidnap a romance novelist hmm
my god
this shouldnt be this hard
it is not some paupers grave
were looking for
it is a monument to a great man
king kalaman was ambitious
he was powerful
he was the first man
to build a city in the atlantic
the eyes of his subjects
would have turned to him
he would have had a pyramid
a ziggurat a tower
to hold his crown of fire
all i need to know
is where it is
i dont know if you recall
but you only said translate it
ii translated it
translate it again
one day were gonna
laugh about this
such an adventure were having
i should go with you
just for backup and awesomeness
this is pretty awesome
you got nature the radio
yeah youre right
but its very very important to me
that she knows
that i came to rescue her
why
do you like this woman
no i just brought snacks
and stuff
and she gets a little grumpy
when shes hungry
blood pressure drops and i get that
because im a fivemealaday kind of guy
do you keto by the way
you look like you keto
no
no yeah
you dont need it
what is it
i just want her to think of me
as more than a cover model
but alan you are so much
more youre my lookout

where i put her in the car
and i just go
shh youre safe now

the mission now okay
oh

take a little walk
to the edge of town
and go across the tracks
where the viaduct looms

as it shifts and cracks
where secrets lie in the
border fires in the humming wires
hey man you know

past the square
past the bridge
past the mills
past the stacks

somebody comes and rescues us
uh this
this is the rescue
no one else is coming
im sorry
im the rescue
it was originally just gonna be me

i am on the cusp
of attaining the unattainable
something singular
something no nation
no emperor no brown no sing

the legendary crown of fire
so yes
yes i would definitely say
its worth it
excuse me

to my next connecting flight

i dont know
maybe theres a
no lives are at stake
i need to go
to the island tonight
ah
yes
even more serious
extremely
well i believe that i may be able

murdered anyone before
no
i dont know if i really buy it
but let me tell you something
if you ever think about murdering
me i promise i will murder you first
my pleasure
you are weird lets go
king kalaman and his treasure
laid to rest in the well
of endless tears
what is that
oh its a its a thing
i mean its not uh
you know its not
what you think it is
so its not fairfaxs fragment
of an ancient parchment
okay
its what you think it is
loretta i thought
you were smarter than that
fairfax is never
gonna stop hunting us now
what were you thinking
we have a volcano
that could bury the tomb
before we get to it before we see
it before we preserve its memory
this is im sorry
is that what were doing
cause no one told me
when were you gonna tell me
why would i tell you
were in this together
i came here to rescue you
you know youre not dash right
you dont ride in on a
white horse to rescue people
you spray yourself with bronzer
and you stand in front of wind machines
which is great for you
how would you have any idea
what im actually like
i know you youre
a pretty open book alan
okay then who am i
really
yeah
o okay uh
you were a homecoming king and
you coasted on your good looks to la
but then realized that being the most
handsome kid in the middle of nowhere
doesnt mean
youre going to be a star
until one day when a woman
who couldnt publish her book
on spanish colonization in the atlantic
decided to write a romance novel
uh chose you at random
to be on the cover
lucky for you and her
the novels were a smashing success
she kept writing her schlock
you kept posing
um you know neither one of us
becoming who wed hoped we would be
uh and then one day
we both die in the jungle
on one of those atlantic islands
i wrote about all those years ago
right
mmhmm
it was sarasota by the way
its not nowhere
i grew up there with
my mom and two sisters
and yeah
i started modeling
cause i wanted to get away
it was the only job
that i could think of
that could take me to all of the places
that i always dreamed of going
then finally to los angeles
where i posed on the cover
of your romance novel
and i was so embarrassed that
one of my friends mightve seen me
in that wig
on the cover of your book
that i avoided talking to them
for months
and then one day
im walking home
and i hear this lady yell
dash
she runs up and she is so happy
then i thought
how could i be this embarrassed
about something
that makes people this happy
loretta you can do
whatever you want
if you dont want to
write anymore dont write
but dont minimize the people that
love your work by calling it schlock
thats not fair to them
you know whats ironic i thought
you of all people would know
not to judge a book
by its cover
judge a book by its cover model
alan
alan
theres two of them
loretta im over here
alan
alan motorcycles and guns
motorcycles and guns
come on this way
stop shooting
just give em the parchment
i cant
yes you can actually you just
say here and throw it at em
right and then im sure
theyll happily let us go
okay keep down
how do they keep finding us
youre basically a walking disco ball
we need to come up with a plan
i have an idea
were gonna dig a hole
throw our voices
were over here
can you sound like a bird
no i have a plan
alan please im thinking
i know but i have a plan
please just let me think about
wait a minute theyre shooting at
you yeah thats why were hiding
no no no no
theyre shooting only at you
they wont shoot me
its my brain thats valuable
what i dont think you actually
hear the things you say sometimes
maybe i can shield you
you are not shielding me
i should be shielding you
why because im a woman
thats supremely sexist well look i
dont think using women as human shields
is exactly the change that
gloria seinfeld had in mind do you
gloria steinem whatever
her too you know what fine
please mansplain sexism to me
right now oh my god i am a woman
i cant mansplain anything
uh im a feminist and i think a
woman can do anything a man can do
we just need to stay here until
they get tired i have an idea
please can i tell you my plan
alan
this is not a situation you can get
out of by ripping your shirt off
not my shirt
three
yes
oh
oh
that was different
than i had in my head
i just wanted us to stop them could it
have been the wind that made it do that
no i think it was us
i think we did it
we did the one guy right
but that was like
we just wanted him to stop but i
think the other guy couldve moved really
so that was
that one was on him
even if we werent here
that couldve happened
why are you gonna stop
next to a cliff
they were wearing helmets
so maybe theyre
but the rest of their body
didnt have a helmet
so thered just be a head
they were driving
recklessly right
dont be mean on a bike
dont do mean stuff on a bike
i mean perhaps theyre fine
yeah probably not
but thats okay
thats all right you know
things happen lets go
you gonna put it back together
its on loan
look at me
okay
what more can i do you know
youve done so much already
beth
my poor sweet little nana
has lost her sight
the book release
is a complete disaster
which ive leveraged
everything on
so im probably most definitely
broke right now
and most importantly
ive lost a writer
who does that
who loses a writer
okay beth you remind me
of my best friend randy
always looking out
for other people
never taking care of herself
isnt that right randy
shes like my therapist
this one over here
lol laughing out loud
after you take care
of your friend
how about we go to a beach
what
look i have a pickup in hawaii
she doesnt have to come
okay okay you can come
shes hilarious
let me ask you something
were all sitting here chitchatting

autopilot
what
sir go to the cockpit
fly the plane
okay
im going to go land the plane
okay
no no no take the goat

so uh police
are searching for fairfax
and theyre gonna provide us
protection while were here
did they say
how long wed be here
theyre gonna try to get us on a
puddle jumper later this evening
but uh they said in the
meantime the inn is really nice
and we can get cleaned up
and maybe a change of clothes
okay
okay yeah
thank you
come on
dance with your husband
no no no
hes not my husband
its okay
dance with him
no no she doesnt want to
she doesnt have the right shoes
actually its the only thing
these shoes are right for
you dont have to do this
its okay its okay
yeah
i wonder what shes saying
its folklore
love song about a woman
whose lover died and she
didnt want to leave his side
so she laid down
and refused to get up
must be scary
having to face your future without
the person that you planned it with
what was that
excuse me excuse me the
um the last line that you sang
quién llorará junto a mí
the island will weep for me
in the well of endless tears
what is that the well of endless
tears is that a real place or
sinkhole place
thank you gracias gracias
come here come here
what is it
hey on the parchment it said
king kalaman and his treasure
laid to rest in the well of endless tears
i thought
maybe it was a metaphor
its not
the well of endless tears
is a place
its a sinkhole
theres a sinkhole on the map
i think the tomb is there
this is so much better
than your books what
theres like
no i dont mean any offense
im kidding im kidding
its like equal
im kidding im kidding look
at you you want to go there
what no
i can see yes you do
that would be insane that
would be insane i just i just
its just that were so close to it
but you know we cant
no
this is your story
how do you want to write it
id like to know
that its there
that all this meant something
okay then lets go
well stay one more day
as soon as the suns up
were gonna go find
the well of endless tears
but what if its nothing
so what then we say we tried
and fairfax
the cops are after fairfax
dont worry about him
this is crazy
yeah but look at you
what
its the very first time ive ever
seen you totally unafraid
and alive
im gonna go tell them our plans
have changed and find us a ride
where are you going
i see you met my friend here
he told me you were just
about to jump on a plane
without so much as
saying goodbye
i said no way
not my loretta
not when shes the only one
who can lead me to the tomb
stop squeezing so hard
ow get your hands off of me
ow let go
ii need a car
a car an auto
does anybody have an auto
no no no
iii need an auto
ill trade you my watch
its a really expensive watch
do you have a car
its a bulgari
this thing glows in the dark
its waterproof
i have motorcycle
cool isnt it
i always thought why cant your
personal tank also have a minibar
have a drink
do you mind
uh yes
he has a bit of a grudge
against you im afraid
something about a motorbike
accident his friends had
why are you doing this
i want something
nobody else has
when my father gifted
as i was saying
when my father gifted his empire
to my baby brother
who is that
is that a ken doll on a moped
i know him from somewhere
oh iii doubt that
because what you are looking at
is a highly trained
combat specialist
forged in the furnaces
of afghanistan iraq
kuwait sa sarasota
incredible skin
no eczema problems
and he will not stop
until i am safe
so you pull
this space tank over
unless you would like to perish
like his friends did
and he is responsible
for their perishment
he might not have meant to
but they perished so
okay whowho is this
i have seen him
somewhere before
no no no
thats your cover model
isnt it
yes i knew
i knew him from somewhere
get up there
and kill him creatively
i love watching hunks fail
i guess ii will
have that drink
oh shit
is it okay
if i just top er off
yeah thats fine but
oh my god
have you used a glass before

ladyfantasy books loretta

hi
so whoevers in charge
i need you to send
officials to go here
here
we are closed
youre closed
you know ive been trying to take
a nap for a year and a half
a year and a half
i have been burning the candle
at both ends
the midnight oil
since way before
my friend got kidnapped
and all i want to do
is kick my feet back
and drink some wine
that im probably
too tired to drink
and i want a massage
i want someone to massage
my shoulders and my feet
and i want it at the same time
and i dont care if logistically
that doesnt make sense
because i have worked hard
the same way that
i know that you have
so i hate to ask you
to leave this place open
a few more minutes
because if we dont
a very close friend of mine
and her cover model
are going to die
no good way in boss
what about the caves
thats too dangerous
well
well be very careful then
well come on
this way
i have a rule about
not going into
super creepy caves
julian
his name is julian

a buck or a bruce
lead the way
go on dont be scared
watch your step there
bruce
julian oh no
julian
whoa
whoa
well
lets not have
his death be in vain
onward and upward
what do you mean onward
were not gonna go
and get him now are we
oh man
its nothing
okay
yeah look lets just
go back to the boat
this is over
nobody else has to die
no no no haha
its a breeze
theres a tunnel
this could lead to the tomb
thats not personsized
ah speak for yourself
come on
its practically a kiddie slide
more like a rock sphincter
or a troll anus
all right well you are
going through the anus
the hole the tunnel
why her
you are our canary in the coal mine
no thats impossible
i cant
please let us know
if you get through
if we dont hear from you
fabios got to die
wait
im the damsel in distress
its okay im fine
i cant
im so sorry i cant
hey
what
hey you smell that
you mean centuries worth of bat
feces yes i definitely smell that
you gotta take
a big breath for me
there you go
you can do it loretta
i think i see a way out
oh cheese and rice
i made it
i made it
see totally safe
go on your turn
im coming through
be right there okay
why would they build this here
but how is anyone
supposed to worship
or remember you
if they cant even see it
they arent
this isnt a monument
to kalamans power
its a hiding place
for a grieving woman
taha came here
to be with her fallen lover
she just wanted to be alone
taha doesnt want us here
god shut up rafi
its just the volcano
come on
we have to keep going
all right
lets go muscles
open it up
dont disturb them
she will be wearing the headdress
come on we didnt come all
this way just to pay our respects
i cant um
uh im sorry abuela
what is that
are those seashells
the crown is made of seashells
wheres the treasure
shes holding him
you mean the dead guy
look
its their courtship
kalaman is searching the island
for something
rare red seashells
to prove his love he gave her
one shell every day for a year
and made them into a crown
bright red like
the flame of their love
until the day came
where she accepted his proposal
it was never about jewels
kalaman and tahas riches
werent material
it was their love
thats what it meant
that was enough
so thats it
all of that time and money
spent on what
just a cheap metaphor
its a pretty rich metaphor
oh shut up
we got to go we got to go now
come on lets go
no no no you are staying here
you think its all
so sweet and poetic
well then you can stay here
and spend your last moments
pondering the richness
of that metaphor
get in
what come on man
oh god just get in get in the tomb
okay okay
its better to be buried alive
than buried dead i guess
its really not
you know it is a shame really
this is a hell of a story
pity you wont be around
to tell it come on
but theyll die
so will you
if you dont stop being such a snowflake
get over here
this is fine
this is not an active nightmare
ive had since
i was 14 years old
