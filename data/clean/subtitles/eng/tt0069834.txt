daniel 
daniel

i ve never been in one of them 
what are you doing in town  you   
come here 
all right  i know where you are 
where s your kid brother 
he s around 
around 
isn t he going to school 
  sometimes 
  sometimes 
how s he gonna get a proper education
going to school  sometimes  
instead of raising ned  you ought
to be raising that brother of yours 
ain t you got no sense of responsibility 
your mother  god rest her soul   
seen to it you could read and write   
could do your ciphers proper 
the least you could do
is the same for your kid brother 
why 
why 
i ain t his pa 
yeah 
marshal  you should have seen   
you re fired 
billy joe 
where you going 
come here 
hello  budger 
hello  pa 
you re bleeding again 
yeah 
seems like every time you show up 
you been bleeding 
yeah 
only sometimes it s hard to remember
when the last time you showed up was 
i ll admit it s been a while 
j d 
hello  hank  you have a good rest 
where did you come from 
where the hell is grady 
what s the matter 
did i say something wrong

grady s been killed  j d 
for the first time 
marshal  good to see you  but i   
any luck 
no  sir 
i brought you a couple of guests 
the sheriff from dawson city
will pick them up in a day or so 
i m awfully sorry about sheriff grady 
i know he was a friend of yours 
yeah 
i m not gonna   
mourn for him 
he lived a good life 
guess there s no good way to die  so   
tell me what happened 
pretty sketchy 
all kane said before he died was 
 four men wearing yellow slickers  
grady got shotgunned 
and i pulled a knife out of jim kane 
they broke in the back door of the bank
with sledgehammers 
we rode a 30 mile circumference   
with a 20 man posse 
including two apaches 
no tracks 
that s impossible 
unless they re still in town 
no  sir  mr  cahill  no strangers 
some local ranchers  some cowboys   
maybe not as sweet as scrubbed angels   
but in public view when it happened 
no strangers 
how about them 
they was in jail when it happened 
that right  daniel 
that s right 
pity 
mr  gordine 
when will you let us out of here 
drunk and disorderly
is usually about 24 hours 
i guess now is a good a time as any 
i m gonna make a little trip 
take a day or two 
will you hold them till i get back 
i can t do that  marshal 
no cause 
suit yourself 
daniel 
  yes  sir 
  gonna deputize you 
no pay 
that figures 
hold up your right hand 
do you swear to uphold the law
of baird  texas   
united states of america 
and i ain t gonna forget
your taking care of billy joe  either 
he s a lot younger than my other boarders 
but it ll be nice to have
a young boy around again 
i sure appreciate it 
and if he stays  it ll be the first cahill
i ve been able to keep under my roof 
if he causes you any trouble 
you just sit right down on him 
and as for you  billy joe   
what the hell are you whispering about 
don t you know
that whispering ain t polite   
except in church  or a courtroom 
what he s saying ain t private  pa 
billy joe was thinking you ought
to let the doctor see your shoulder 
it s been took care of  bandaged  and   
  by whom  j d  
  by what 
whom 
that s the correct way of asking
who done it 
i took care of it 
purified it with whiskey 
yeah  a quart and a half  he drunk it 
you re scared 
you re scared of dr  jones is what you are 
they say the last time
you was in his office   
they could hear you yelling
from austin to el paso 
  get the horses 
  billy joe s right 
they say he s hit notes
music publishers ain t heard 
get the horses  daniel 
austin to el paso 
thought i yelled louder than that 
hetty 
goodbye 
come on  let s go in 
where are we going 
first we ll pick ourselves up a tracker 
that  breed comanche
over by the goldicks  place 
the one thing i hate
more than a comanche is half of one 
his name is lightfoot 
i wouldn t call him  breed to his face 
were i you 
not if you want to reach maturity 
  what s the matter 
  nothing 
didn t take that struther long
to make new friends 
papa  a stranger s coming 
i see him 
good morning  my dear chief 
i hope all goes well in your lives 
how about a cigar 
chief 
cigar 
what the hell do you want  j d  
i ain t got no money 
my horse is on his last legs 
and my genuine bearskin overcoat 
i lost in a crap game 
need a tracker  lightfoot 
that s better 
how long would you say 
two days  maybe three 
it s   
cold up in them mountains 
that s a fact 
first day   5 
 2 a day thereafter

might be friends of mine 
that s suitable 
ma am

slight negligence in his upbringing 
ma am 
what you bringing us up here for 
don t you know 
if i knowed i wouldn t ask 
what are you walking on 
rock face 
that s right  rock face 
starts back there out of valentine 
climbs all the way up   
to heaven  so the   
comanches say 
now  nobody just disappears  daniel 
if the men that killed ben grady
ain t in town   
and didn t leave tracks
that two apaches could read   
then they re up here somewhere 
and if they are  i ll find them 
yes  sir  daniel 
that s the truth you can bank on
in denver 
if they re up here   
i ll find them 
been smelling smoke 
half a mile down the ridge 
how many 
hired on as a tracker 
stay here  daniel 
i ll have a look 
something on your mind 
just thinking   
if you wasn t j d   s boy 
what a good time i d have right now 
what i d like to do to you
brings back fond memories 
i don t know what you re talking about 
i don t like you 
that s what i m talking about 
let me tell you something  half breed 
  i don t care what you have to say about   
  you don t care about anything 
the difference between you
and j d  cahill 
even them that hates him 
admire him for that 
he cares 
he doesn t care about billy joe and me 
kid  i ve had buffalo brains
that s got more going for them than you 
you got a bad feeling about your pa
 cause he ain t home every night   
to powder your butt and tuck you in 
what business is it of yours  anyway 
i ve ridden with him 
and i ve sweat with him 
and i ve froze with him 
and i ve tracked for him 
and i ve cooked for him 
and i ve covered
even two dozen gunfights   
here he comes 
and what s more   
i ve set near about every bone in his body
that s decent enough to talk about 
they re out there  all right 
camped in the shelter of some trees 
daniel   
get your rifle 
you taking him with you 
yeah 
j  d   
give me my  5

i ll come back and bury you 
mumble something christian
over your grave 
lightfoot  your kindness overwhelms me 
it might not be them out there  pa 
let s go ask them 
  the fire s dying out 
  let it 
i d think a long time
before i did anything rash 
cahill 
united states marshal 
  pa 
  hold it 
mister  i ain t got a bigoted bone
in my body 
you don t drop that axe   
i ll blast you to hell
as quick as i would a white man 
come on in 
all right  let s get rid of the hardware 
boy 
i ain t got no knife  mister 
friend   
you look like a hideaway man to me 
what is it 
derringer or a palm gun 
lightfoot 
yeah 
are they friends of yours 
nope 
you know them at all 
nope 
daniel 
i don t know them 
that ought to do about as much damage
to a bank door as a sledgehammer 
wouldn t you say  daniel 
new money 
where d you get it 
where d you get it 
don t  pa 
ben grady leaves a wife
and two little boys 
i asked you a question 
you may gather i m a little impatient 
where d you get that money 
we took it from a mormon drover
in new mexico 
we had a lot less than we needed   
and he had a lot more than he needed 
mormon drover in new mexico 
yes  sir 
that s the god s truth 
how old are you  boy 
he s 16 
just turned 16  is all 
belong to you 
my grandson 
mister  you ain t gonna put those on me 
  daniel  get their horses 
  you ain t going to 
either that or i ll kill you 
i don t think they did it  pa 
that s for the jury to say  not me 
i don t think they did it 
son  if you know something i don t   
i d be obliged to hear about it 
otherwise  go get their horses 
  five pounds of tea 
  golden tips  ma am 
no  oongal or black oolong  mr  campbell 
and a 140 pound sack
of ceylon java coffee 
five pounds of wilbur s breakfast cocoa

and two more for good luck  billy joe 
thank you 
and six two pound tins of plum pudding 
and i want   
now  billy joe  put that down 
  that s much too heavy for you

the money wasn t
where it was supposed to be 
it wasn t where we told you to put it 
and we looked  but it just wasn t there 
we is some disappointed in you  boy 
struther practically being a father to you 
and all 
and him taking your betrayal of us
real personally   
he wanted to come into town
and cut you up real bad 
but i told him that wasn t necessary 
there must be
some kind of misunderstanding   
cause you is a good boy 
a good boy   
who wouldn t betray his friends 
no  sir  i just wouldn t believe
that you d do anything so   
foolish 
where s the money 
struther 
where s the money 
  i hid it 
  where  you hid it where 
i ain t telling  i ain t 
why in the hell not  you little son of a   
why not 
would you explain it to me  please 
because me and mine
don t like to be threatened   
and chased and told what to do 
if you kill me 
you ain t never gonna find that money 
never 
pick him up  we gotta take him
where nobody will hear him scream 
  come here 
  let me down 
  damn you 
  get him 
watch out  damn wire 
where the hell did he get to 
trouble  j d 
i see them 
they look nasty  pa 
yeah 
friends of ben grady  i guess 
yeah 
there s that 
but mostly  it s money 
bank gets robbed  town goes broke 
most people think
all that money belongs to the bankers 
it don t 
it s the little folks  savings 
what about us 
yeah 
what about you 
we ll take them from here on  j d 
just like that 
just like that 
lightfoot  how far away
would you say they are 
about 10  12 feet 
make a good pattern for this buckshot 
there s no use potting around 
i m willing to die trying to keep them 
the question is  are you willing to die
trying to take them 
now  i m cold and hungry  and   
wet and tired and short tempered 
so get on with it 
hell  get out of my way 
  j d  
  hank

the doctor doesn t want anybody in there
until he s finished with the boy 
now  you can just wait right here 
women 
things seem to happen to you two
when i m   
not around 
like the time gordine s horse kicked you   
  and broke your leg   
  pa 
and the time billy joe   
  got poison ivy all over his face and

you re dead right  daniel 
i can t argue that 
i ve been gone a lot of times
when you kids really needed me 
and i ve missed a lot  too 
missed watching you two grow up 
i think about it a lot   
on every job   
about how  when it s over   
i ll come home and the three of us
will get to know one another 
but even before that job was finished   
another one always seemed   
to crop up 
another bank robbed  another murder 
i don t want what i m saying
to sound like i m making excuses 
there s no excuse for negligence 
no excuse for a man ignoring his   
duty  either 
your mother   
god bless her   
when she was dying   
the last thing she said on earth was 
 go get them  j d  
and i ve been going   
and getting them ever since

the devil won 
seems like the devil always wins 
maybe that s why so many people
are on his side 
yeah 
but i ain t really 
i just wanted to get back at pa
for never being around 
pa ain t so bad  danny 
let s tell him about the whole thing
and be done with it 
we can t 
figure we don t know him
well enough yet 
no  that ain t it 
if pa gets himself into something 
he gets himself out 
and that s what we gotta do 
get ourselves out
without fraser killing us

it wouldn t hurt
to be a little quiet and careful 
for what 
to take candy away from babies 
why do you suppose
they wouldn t tell me 
didn t they know
if they confided in me  i d   
give them a chance  j d

comanche war chief

not bad 
how s the leg 
if you re asking me as a war chief
of the comanche nation   
i don t feel a thing 
if you re asking the white part of me 
it hurts like hell 
  that s the white man groaning  i take it 
  you re damn right 
i ll need that bottle of whiskey you ve got 
when you re finished with this thing 
if you should come out alive

i ll throw that in   50 
 50 
you want them or not 
your feet 
get the mcclellan 
stay with him  j d  
stay with him 
might be faster if you walked 
more comfortable  too 
seeing as we re in such a hurry 
of course   50 ain t too much to pay for   
a spirited  well bred animal like that 
lightfoot   
i never heard a bona fide war chief
talk so much 
how much further you calculate  danny 
about an hour

you shouldn t oughta treat me like a baby 
  i m near 13 years old 
  you re only 11  and that s all you are 
eleven going on 12 
and you ain t grown no brains yet at all 
that s your excuse 
i m 17 
i must ve lost any brains i ever had
to get us into a mess like this 
those men are gonna hang because of us 
i can t get it off my mind 
if fraser don t get here quick 
it ll be too late 
you calculate that they ll kill us
if they can  don t you  danny 
don t like it 
don t like it at all 
there ain t no easy way to do this 
so let s go find out 
damn 
lightfoot 
well  don t break out in tears 
you ve seen dying men before  ain t you 
i want a cigar 
won t do you much good   
coughing the way you are 
won t do me no harm  neither 
you don t have to worry about your family
while i m alive 
hell  i know that 
i always loved these things 
never could afford them 
you got a nice bright fire 
signal fire 
except there s nobody to signal to 
ain t that right  brownie 
i told you i took care of things 
where s your brother 
where s billy joe 
right here  mr  fraser 
boy  you better put that thing down 
billy joe  that ain t necessary 
we re all friends here 
boy  this is old abe fraser 
danny  tell him that ain t necessary 
there s your share of the money 
mr  fraser 
three fifths  about  12 000 
that ain t right  danny 
the usual way  the proper way 
is for the leader to make the split 
it all works out the same way
but one likes to observe the proprieties 
you understand 
  you got the rest of the money with you 
  no  we don t 
that money s well hid 
we didn t come here
to get our throats slit 
you d just best take your share and go 
you re a hard case  ain t you 
just like your old man 
no  i ain t 
if it was him  he d shoot you
while he had the chance  right now 
you d best take that money
and get while you still can 
no 
no  i won t 
you won t 
not till i ve had my say
and cleared my name 
fraser 
we played fair and square with you 
in spite of your youth and inexperience 
we agreed to share equally with you 
and we have 
you agree to that  don t you 
and you  billy joe   
who was it let you stay in bed
so you d get well 
of course we had some disagreement 
on account of you changing your mind 
not us 
i was gonna invite you
to come to my sister s with us 
and take you under my wing  as it were 
but i see that ain t your wish  so i ll   
say goodbye to you 
i offer you my hand in friendship
and in parting 
i sure hope you won t shame me
by refusing to take it 
goodbye  mr  fraser 
they ll be waiting for us 
won t they  danny 
better now than in the daylight 
pa 
  am i ever glad to see you 
  still got the money 
  part of it 
  fraser s taken his share already 
yes 
where s yours 
  we buried it  l   
  go dig it up 
just back them up and go around it 
you ain t leaving 
four innocent men
are gonna get hung in the morning 
i m going back to stop it 
  take billy joe with you 
  just do as you re told 
don t you understand 
they re gonna be there waiting for us 
j d  cahill 
doesn t give a damn about us 
back 
danny  look out 
i gave you your chance 
you gotta give me that 
  i held out my hand in friendship and   
  in a pig s eye  you did 
you was gonna kill us
the first chance you got 
the trouble with you  boy 
is that you got no grace 
you should allow a man his illusions 
danny 
fraser 
danny  are you dead 
got the wind knocked out of me 
boy  you really had me scared 
lying there like that 
  give me that horse 
  we got the money 
i want him 
and i want them two boys 
and i want them bad 
you staked us out  pa 
before you form any lasting judgment
on me   
it was the only way
i could get fraser out into the open 
we almost got killed 
you could have got killed
robbing that bank  too 
are they gone 
we can t worry about them 
we have to get back to town
before morning 
what s gonna happen to us 
i don t know 
we ll get a fair trial  won t we 
lots of men get a fair trial and hang 
we were gonna give back
our share of the money 
i know you were  son 
and confess 
and we did try to stop the killing 
  i know  daniel  i wish   
  pa 
i ll get the money  pa 
here  billy joe 
hold it 
you d even shoot a dead man 
no  and i ain t gonna let him
shoot me  neither 
get up 
get me a rope 
budger 
you re bleeding again  pa 
i guess it goes with the badge 
  you got a kerchief 
  yeah 
jam it in this hole  it ll stop the bleeding 
here  i ll do it 
thank you  pa 
here s the money  all of it 
good 
i hope   
now what s gonna happen to us 
they re gonna be
a little short of witnesses 
and i can sure testify
that you got the town its money back 
do you think
that it ll be reason enough maybe   
for the judge to put us in your custody 
i don t know  son 
he might 
but we can t depend on it
