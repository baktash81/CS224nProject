there  enough said  subject closed 
hey  hey 
well  don t just stand there 
give me a kiss 
or are you too grown up
for that now 
hello  albie 
oh  armand  our baby is going to leave
us  and we won t have any others 
not without a miracle 
when senator keeley and i founded
the coalition for moral order 
it was to express moral 
rather than political  views 
what senator jackson
is trying to say is that
morality is political 
abortion  same sex marriage   
it s a wonderful show 
the most intelligent one
on television 
pornography would not exist
if politicians didn t
make laws to protect them 
that s why both houses
are now republican 
it s the perfect platform 
i m glad i got on jackson s bandwagon
instead of dole  dole is just too   
dark 
i was going to say liberal 
but he s dark  too 
i gotta fire this woman 
this young man barbie
wants to marry   
miss porter  page two 
paragraph two 
it s  porno   not  pronto  
i wonder if he s old money 
i mean  a cultural attaché 
your campaign manager is calling 
he says he s got to talk to you 
thank you  bridget 
hello  ben 
ready for what 
what 
what s wrong  kevin 
jackson s dead 
oh  my god 
he died in bed 
whose bed 
a prostitute 
a minor 
and black 
i don t believe this  i don t
fucking believe this  i m ruined 
you cannot be held responsible
for senator jackson s private life 
i m the vice president of the
coalition for moral order 
my co founder just died in the bed
of an underage black whore 
wait until the media finds out 
bridget 
i could really use some candy 
you want one of these 
oh  this 
 crying  my baby 
 armand    why does it seem
  so real to me 
albert  you re driving me crazy 
i know  but   
penmanship award 
there s the bar mitzvah 
 weeping 
time passes so quickly 
well  he looked kind of funny 
but he was smiling  so i didn t worry 
how do they get them on so quickly 
they pay 
they re not mentioning you much 
it s early 
 tv  senator jackson s last
words tonight on inside edition 
can you get a good
shot of the house 
we may not make the live shot 
if we must  i ll do a stand up 
 he looked kind of funny    
    but he was smiling 
so i didn t worry  
yeah  we got a good spot  i don t know
if he s going to    excuse me 
why don t you set up there  figure
you ll get part of the house and me   
i don t know if he ll come out 
where s dad 
he snuck out to meet with his advisers 
they wouldn t come here 
i shouldn t have let him go 
how will he get back in 
mom 
mom  i have something to tell
you about val s parents 
they can t blame us for this 
eli jackson was a common redneck 
we never saw him socially 
they can understand that  can t they 
thank goodness they re not snobs 
   knocking at window 
  oh 
what are you doing here 
i came through the orchard 
over the barn 
you could have fallen 
i did  i m a wreck  this thing
is all anyone can talk about 
kevin 
there may be a solution 
what  death 
it didn t work for jackson 
what about a wedding 
a big  white wedding 
what wedding 
who s getting married 
no  no 
why not 
it would restore your image 
a wedding is hope  and a white wedding
is family and morality and tradition 
and it would be such
a special marriage 
the son of a cultural attaché 
a sort of a diplomat  really 
who doesn t look down on us
because of senator jackson 
willingly joining our family  it d mean
the cover of people  time and newsweek 
love and optimism
versus cynicism and sex 
it would be an affirmation  we could get
the pope s blessing  it s not hard 
no  he s too controversial 
what about billy graham 
no  he s too liberal 
where s the candy 
you ve had enough candy 
this boy    what s his father s name 
armand    coleman 
 mrs  keeley  i wonder if they re
related to tish and bobo coleman 
  are they from boston 
  i don t think so 
i think we should go to south beach 
we should have dinner   
we ll have dinner with them
and stay with the bushes 
mr  and mrs  armand coleman
of greece and south beach 
 diana 
  what is this dream i see 
  why does it seem so real
  to me 
  what if this dream turns out to be
  more than a dream 
fairy dust  fairy dust  fairy dust 
  come  little dream and play
  don t be afraid
  don t fade away
  quick  little dream
  before you re gone
  let s get it on
  you    oh 
i saw that 
well  this is impossible 
either i m an artist
or i m just some cheap drag queen
trying to get laughs 
 armand 
let s just get through it 
 albert  i have to understand
every nuance of a song 
i have to give my all  everyone else can
just  get through it   he s chewing gum 
chewing gum helps me think 
sweetie  you re wasting your gum 
let s keep going 
and no more talking    from anyone 
  i need to talk to you 
  sit 
  it s important 
  quiet  he s rehearsing 
  and i the dreamer
  each night anew
  tell me  my dream
  are you a dreamer  too 
what is it 
  can you come upstairs with me 
  no  not right now 
did you see what he just did 
hello  vallie  darling 
  what did he do 
  he blew a bubble 
he can t do that while i m singing 
celsius  look  this may
be a drag show 
but it still has be a good drag show 
if possible  a great one 
just because you re
22 and hung   
i ll do this  albert 
  you re the director 
  thank you 
this is a complex number 
full of mythic themes 
the woman who is singing
invented you 
you are her fantasy  suddenly 
you  the fantasy  see her  your
inventor  and she becomes your fantasy 
  i don t get it 
  try more gum 
  albert 
  i hear you 
thank you  i know you do 
 armand  celsius  let s
start with the premise
that when you see this stunning 
smoldering creature 
she transcends your desire to chew 
she electrifies you 
something starts in your pelvis
and goes to your heart 
where it becomes heart pelvis 
  pop 
  yes  coming 
what do i do 
stand here like an object 
no  you do an eclectic
celebration of the dance 
you do fosse  fosse  fosse  or martha
graham  martha graham  martha graham 
or twyla  twyla  twyla  or michael
kidd  michael kidd  michael kidd 
or madonna  madonna  madonna 
but you keep it all inside 
work on that  i ll be right back

barbara s coming with her parents

it would mean everything to
me if you would help us 
it s just for one night 
this is insane 
what do i do  close the club
so i can pretend to be a cultural
attache  whatever that is 
and what about albert  how do you make
albert into a housewife 
well  you d have to
send him away 
are you nuts

waiting for the senator to appear 
the senator was co founder
of the coalition for moral order

 whistles 
   by a virtual army of media  waiting

to be val s gay uncle 
i could play it straight 
oh  please  look at you

it s a cliché  but it s an image 
john wayne 
oh  god  couldn t we start
with someone easier 
come on  you re a big fan 
he has a very distinctive walk 
very easy to imitate  and if anyone
was a man    now try it 
now just get off your horse
and head into the saloon 
nice touch 
howdy  ma am 
no good 
actually  it s perfect  i never
realized john wayne walked like that 
hang on 
this guy s a fucking maniac 
what s in south beach 
armand goldman 
you old so and so 
how about those dolphins 
screaming queen 
the hand goes sideways  not palm down 
i m shaking it  not kissing it 
tighten your wrist 
no  straighten it  then tighten it 
al  you old so and so 
  i just said that 
  now i m saying it 
okay  straighten  tighten 
al  you old son of a bitch 
how do you feel about that call today 
the dolphins  in the fourth on their
30 yard line with only 34 seconds to go 
how do you think i feel 
betrayed  bewildered 
wrong response 
i m not sure 
take it from the top 
this is very exciting

the asshole behind you

gone down  it s nothing 
you were magnificent 
marvelous  very masculine

he didn t even know how to box 
thank you  value

maids in south beach

who will we say he is 
your uncle 
my uncle

the whole thing 
don t be so negative 
have a little hope 
about what  once they see you

oh  my god  oh  my god 
i was feeling so good  and now   
god  what a mess 
we need a woman 
we can pass albert off as an uncle
if we have a woman as a mother 
ironic  isn t it 
when you need a woman   
why don t i ask your mother 
my mother wouldn t do it 
would she 
  how do we know 
   cause she hasn t seen me in 20 years 
no  20 years ago  she was
a young girl  scared  broke  now   
 albert  you can t be serious 
it s very unfair of you to try to talk
val into this  he has every reason   
you think she d do it 
my mother 
oh  my god  armand 
i don t believe it 
it s been 100 years  where are you

  virgins are distinctly nervous   
  virgins are distinctly nervous
  love is going around

how unavailable  and what a body 
you re embarrassing me 
you were so terrified 
it was so sweet 
i nearly died  i walk into my room
and there s a woman in my bed 
i paid the doorman 20 dollars 
20 dollars in those days 
oh  god 
i thought   what the hell  
 i ll try it once and see what those
straight guys are raving about  
  how long did we last 
  i know exactly 
from 2 30 till 3 45 a m 
two times 
    love is in the air
    round and about
  this morning  bachelors beware
    maidens watch out
    fair warning
  if you start to feel a tingle
and you like remaining single
  stay    oh  that s your part 
  stay home don t take a breath
  you could catch your death
   cause love is around i
sorry

and you still can dance 
so can you  armand 
thank you  that s so cool 
where did all this hair come from 
wasn t your chest smooth

black nest of hair

you and katharine were probably
laughing at me  too 
well  why not  i m not young

i m quite aware of
how ridiculous i am 
the only solution is to go
where nobody is ridiculous 
where everyone is equal

we decided to drive down
to see the seasons change 
it was a long trip  though 
virginia  kentucky 
tennessee   
   georgia 
it was just so magical to come
from the north  where it s cold   
   to the south  where it s warm   
   and see the tremendous differences
from region to region 
in this incredible country of ours 
my wife and i used to go to virginia
every autumn to see
the foliage turn 
virginia has amazing foliage 
although i do think that the foliage
in ohio is underrated 
  it s just dazzling along i 75 
   phone 
  just dazzling 
   answering machine clicks on 
we would go down to virginia 
to get away for a while 
to see the wonderful farms 
the countryside 
 katharine on answering machine

and the roads  black   
   cutting through the green 
all the colors

  we can do this  work with me 
something very odd is going on 
it s this thing with jackson 
the wife doesn t want to see us

i m sure that s not it 
no  it s something else  something
about the father and the butler 
  it s nothing

the  d  is silent in america 
it s cole d isle au man 
or cole of the isle of man in france
where armand s chateau is 
cole d man in greece
where armand s work is 
and finally  the vulgar coleman
in florida  where armand s home is 
so  we never know where we are until

   mrs  keeley  oh  that explains it 
   senator keeley  at last 
i think i would like to hug you 
mrs  coleman 
oh  my dear child  welcome

hear  hear  it s so nice
to meet people like you 
 senator keeley 
our kind of people 
c o l e m a n 
there s no first name on the bell

what about the name in front
of the club    goldman  that s close 
you re right 
wouldn t that be something 
try goldman  what was it 
armand goldman 
it s so odd to me 
this fuss over school prayer 
as if anyone 
jews  muslims  whatever 
would mind if their children
prayed in the classroom 
  it s insane 
   agador laughs 
thank you  agador spartacus 
you may go 
he s very nice 
but such a problem 
we never know
what makes him laugh 
at least he speaks english 
we have been through more chauffeurs
in the last six months   
and the maids we ve run through
in the last six years 
  rodney  bruno  chuck   
  look  you all need more ice 
i have a good feeling
about you people 
not a lot of clever books
on the shelves 
no fancy art on the walls 
just the crucifix 
and a lot of good 
warm  family feeling 
this is what clinton missed
when he started in on school prayer
and gays in the military 
more ice for you 
there s an idiotic issue 
gays in the military 
i mean  those haircuts 
those uniforms  who cares  
mom  don t talk about things
you don t know about 
don t patronize your mother 
she s amazingly intelligent 
  i think homosexuality   
  a lot more ice for you 
more for me  dad 
   is one of the things
weakening this country 
really 
that s what i thought until i found
out alexander the great was a fag 
talk about gays in the military 
how about those dolphins 
i ll get it 
i think we re skirting an issue here
that has mr  coleman very nervous 
you must have heard about
how senator jackson died 
oh  that 
yes  what an ugly story 
of course  we don t
believe a word of it 
  what do you mean 
  he was obviously framed 
  i  for one  would like an autopsy 
  mom   
that s just what
rush limbaugh said 
excuse me 
the tension    it s like riding a
psychotic horse toward a burning stable 
dinner is going to be late  okay 
 cause you give me
so little time to shop 
barbara s nice 
i owe it to val 
growing up the way he did 
it can t have been easy 
i m sorry to laugh at miss albert 
but what is that hairdo 
fuck it  it s one night 
i can live through it 
of course  it s wrong
to kill an abortion doctor 
many pro lifers  i don t agree with
them  but they feel that if you   
i m here  son 
   stop the doctors 
you stop the abortions 
that s ridiculous 
the doctors are only doing their jobs 
better to kill the mothers 
that will stop them 
may i see you a moment  dear 
i know  i know  if you kill the
mother  the fetus dies  too 
but the fetus is going to be aborted 
so let it go down with the ship 
i really must see you now 
excuse me 
i assure you 
mother is just following a train
of thought to its logical
yet absurd conclusion 
as jonathan swift did
when he suggested
irish peasants feed
their babies to the rich 
i don t know about jonathan swift 
but i know one thing about your mother 
she s a passionate woman
who follows her heart  and i love her 
so goldman owns the club 
lives above it  owns the
building and he s gay 
we are in enquirer heaven 
  i could have danced all night
  i could have danced all night
  and still have begged for more
you have a beautiful voice 
  i could have spread my wings
  and done a thousand things
  i ve never done before   
your mother should know
i want a career and marriage 
barbara  albert isn t my mother 
he s a drag queen 
that s right  i keep forgetting 
he just sounds so much
like a mother 
  i only know
  when he began to dance with me
  i could have danced  danced  danced
  all night  
bravo

he doesn t make this for everyone 
this is his specialty 
seafood chowder 
  isn t that an egg 
  what 
  an egg 
  why  yes  it is  it is a huevo 
this is so guatemala 
they put eggs in
everything down there
because chicken is
so important to them 
it s their only real currency 
a woman is said to be
worth her weight in hens 
a man s wealth is measured
by the size of his cock 
will you excuse me 
what the hell is this 
sweet and sour peasant soup 
why d you say it was seafood chowder 
  what the hell is that 
  i don t know  i made it up 
god  this is a nightmare 
 slurping noises 
where are you
staying in florida 
with the jeb bushes 
on fisher island 
fisher island 
such a lovely spot 
my parents lived on fisher
island until they died 
i thought you were visiting
your parents in palm beach 
 deep voice  what 
oh  yes  uh    now   
   that they re dead 
they moved   
   were moved    because   
well   
my mother always said 
 live on fisher island 
get buried in palm beach 
that way you ll have
the best of florida  
dad  get in there 
everything is going to hell 
he didn t make an entrée 
what  you    you mean
we just have soup 
peasant soup is an entrée 
it s like stew 
why do you think i
put so much in it  
shut up 
put katharine s note
on the downstairs door 
i have to go back before
they get to the bottom of the bowls 
i had so much to do 
you give me no time to shop 
shut up 
it s okay 
we re all right 
shut up  goddamn you 
stop crying  goddamn you 
don t just stand there 
she ll be here any minute  go 
goddamn it 
fuck the shrimp 
oh  my god 
that s it  that s it 
  that s the lincoln 
  park here  the street s jammed 
  this is an intersection 
  so  we re the press 
 katharine  do not go upstairs 
i ll call you tomorrow  armand  
this is going to be great 
from that day on  they looked
for a cemetery they really loved
instead of eating tofu 
daddy favored key biscayne  but   
time for dessert 
you get everything done 
yes 
shall we have our coffee
in the living room 
no  it s his town car 
i am looking at it 
we re in the middle of a bunch
of drag clubs  i don t know 
we got authorization 
so  three 
  so  where are they 
  they went around the corner there 
so what do you think of these kids
getting married 
well  she s only 18
and he s only 20  so i   
 music 
good god  that sounds like
it s coming from downstairs 
 mrs  keeley  it must be coming
from that nightclub on the corner 
this must be the same building 
you re joking  i always thought
that was someone s television set 
now  mother  you know
we live above a nightclub 
she s travelled around
the world  but deep down
she s still a girl from
grover s corners 
i m afraid i am a bit naive 
don t be ashamed of grover s corners 
it s not a chateau  but it s a
darn good place to call home 
thank you 
i will remember that 
of course  armand is much more
sophisticated than i am 
but then  he comes
from such good stock 
just like those two
adorable youngsters 
don t you agree 
  where s the bathroom 
   val  i ll show you 
  no  i want mother coleman to show me 
  my dear child 
one kiss  darling 
  i m only going to the bathroom 
   val  we ll all go 
 albert 
i think you re all crazy 
my men 
 barbara  isn t this wonderful 
all of us together 
 albert  this is so moving 
i think i m going to cry 
something very
strange is going on 
i know 
i mean  that dinner 
i know there was something
on those bowls 
and the son disappearing
while we were eating 
i know just what s going on 
it s the oldest story in the world 
what is it 
she s a small town girl   
   and he s a pretentious european 
the worst kind 
him and his cole d whatever 
and his decadent china 
i ve seen it all before 
aristotle onassis was like this 
and all of the french 
especially mitterrand 
and the english 
not margaret thatcher  of course 
but i bet john major has something
on the side  and she can t handle it 
  who 
  mrs  coleman 
why should she care
about john major 
no  mrs  coleman
can t handle him 
coleman and his nasty
little european traditions 
and his snobbery  and that dig
about grover s corners 
kevin  you re rambling 
well  it makes me furious 
the contempt he has for her 
did you see him when she talked 
he looked almost frightened 
he won t let her run the house 
he s in the kitchen  he serves 
he tells that beige
savage what to do 
what 
i m so sorry 
i ve ruined everything 
don t be silly  no one noticed the wig 
where s the spirit gum 
they took everything away 
i have a barrette  if you don t move
your head  it might work 
thank you 
you re a very sweet girl 
i m so sorry  val 
you didn t have this kind of sympathy
for poor bessie jackson 
bessie jackson is an
insensitive cow 
this woman is a lady 
you know  she ll be your in law  too 
if he s so terrible  maybe your
daughter shouldn t marry his son 
he s not terrible in that way 
he won t get mixed up in some scandal 
  i ve never really seen you before 
  what do you mean 
i don t even know who you are 
all you think about is your career 
and poor  little mrs  coleman 
oh  please  you re just as worried
about my career as i am 
you re the one who pushed for the
marriage  barbara can handle that boy 
she s a modern woman 
tough as nails 
mrs  coleman is just
very vulnerable 
it just breaks my heart  they don t
make woman like that anymore 
 doorbell 
 knocking
