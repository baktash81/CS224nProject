hey hey
well dont just stand there

or are you too grownup
for that now
hello albie
oh armand our baby is going to leave
us and we wont have any others
not without a miracle
when senator keeley and i founded
the coalition for moral order
it was to express moral
rather than political views
what senator jackson
is trying to say is that
morality is political
abortion samesex marriage
its a wonderful show
the most intelligent one
on television
pornography would not exist
if politicians didnt
make laws to protect them
thats why both houses
are now republican
its the perfect platform
im glad i got on jacksons bandwagon
instead of dole dole is just too
dark
i was going to say liberal
but hes dark too
i gotta fire this woman
this young man barbie
wants to marry
miss porter page two
paragraph two
its porno not pronto
i wonder if hes old money
i mean a cultural attaché
your campaign manager is calling
he says hes got to talk to you
thank you bridget
hello ben
ready for what
what
whats wrong kevin
jacksons dead
oh my god
he died in bed
whose bed
a prostitute
a minor
and black
i dont believe this i dont
fucking believe this im ruined
you cannot be held responsible
for senator jacksons private life
im the vice president of the
coalition for moral order
my cofounder just died in the bed
of an underage black whore
wait until the media finds out
bridget
i could really use some candy
you want one of these
oh this
crying my baby
armand  why does it seem
so real to me
albert youre driving me crazy
i know but
penmanship award
theres the bar mitzvah
weeping
time passes so quickly
well he looked kind of funny
but he was smiling so i didnt worry
how do they get them on so quickly
they pay
theyre not mentioning you much
its early
tv senator jacksons last
words tonight on inside edition
can you get a good
shot of the house
we may not make the live shot
if we must ill do a standup
he looked kind of funny
but he was smiling
so i didnt worry
yeah we got a good spot i dont know
if hes going to excuse me
why dont you set up there figure
youll get part of the house and me
i dont know if hell come out
wheres dad
he snuck out to meet with his advisers
they wouldnt come here
i shouldnt have let him go
how will he get back in
mom
mom i have something to tell
you about vals parents
they cant blame us for this
eli jackson was a common redneck
we never saw him socially
they can understand that cant they
thank goodness theyre not snobs
knocking at window
oh
what are you doing here
i came through the orchard
over the barn
you could have fallen
i did im a wreck this thing
is all anyone can talk about
kevin
there may be a solution
what death
it didnt work for jackson
what about a wedding
a big white wedding
what wedding
whos getting married
no no
why not
it would restore your image
a wedding is hope and a white wedding
is family and morality and tradition
and it would be such
a special marriage
the son of a cultural attaché
a sort of a diplomat really
who doesnt look down on us
because of senator jackson
willingly joining our family itd mean
the cover of people time and newsweek
love and optimism
versus cynicism and sex
it would be an affirmation we could get
the popes blessing its not hard
no hes too controversial
what about billy graham
no hes too liberal
wheres the candy
youve had enough candy
this boy whats his fathers name
armand coleman
mrs keeley i wonder if theyre
related to tish and bobo coleman
are they from boston
i dont think so
i think we should go to south beach
we should have dinner
well have dinner with them
and stay with the bushes
mr and mrs armand coleman
of greece and south beach
diana
what is this dream i see
why does it seem so real
to me
what if this dream turns out to be
more than a dream
fairy dust fairy dust fairy dust
come little dream and play
dont be afraid
dont fade away
quick little dream
before youre gone
lets get it on
you oh
i saw that
well this is impossible
either im an artist
or im just some cheap drag queen
trying to get laughs
armand
lets just get through it
albert i have to understand
every nuance of a song
i have to give my all everyone else can
just get through it hes chewing gum
chewing gum helps me think
sweetie youre wasting your gum
lets keep going

inventor and she becomes your fantasy
i dont get it
try more gum
albert
i hear you
thank you i know you do
armand celsius lets
start with the premise
that when you see this stunning
smoldering creature
she transcends your desire to chew
she electrifies you
something starts in your pelvis
and goes to your heart
where it becomes heartpelvis
pop

celebration of the dance

from the north where its cold
to the south where its warm
and see the tremendous differences
from region to region
in this incredible country of ours
my wife and i used to go to virginia
every autumn to see
the foliage turn
virginia has amazing foliage
although i do think that the foliage
in ohio is underrated
its just dazzling along i75
phone
just dazzling

to get away for a while
to see the wonderful farms
the countryside
katharine on answering machine

something very odd is going on
its this thing with jackson
the wife doesnt want to see us

how nice to meet you
mrs coleman
goldman
senator keeley
isnt the d silent
it is pronounced coleman isnt it
weve had some confusion
oh yes coleman
the d is silent in america
its cole disle au man
or cole of the isle of man in france
where armands chateau is
cole dman in greece
where armands work is
and finally the vulgar coleman
in florida where armands home is
so we never know where we are until
we hear our last name pronounced
mrs keeley oh that explains it
senator keeley at last
i think i would like to hug you
mrs coleman
oh my dear child welcome
look at this
this is our footage for the show
on jackson pump up the sound
tv reporter were here at what
theyre calling camp keeley
reporter in background
where you driving him
chauffeur
south beach florida
whered we get this
keeleys house last night
the fat guy
is with the national enquirer
harry rad man
oh yeah my god hes put on so much
weight since the simpson case
this should go to the network
its so wonderful what youve done here
everything is so simple and uncluttered
our house is a sea of papers
you men
youre the biggest babies
they can run the world
but cant pick out a tie
i know i cant get this big lug
to buy a new suit
senator keeley
armand theyre picking on us
albert squeals
oh well
bless them
thats the way nature made them
maybe im just an oldfashioned girl
but i pity the woman whos too busy
to take care of her man
hear hear its so nice
to meet people like you
senator keeley
our kind of people
coleman
theres no first name on the bell
sure they cant find them
what about the name in front
of the club goldman thats close
youre right
wouldnt that be something
try goldman what was it
armand goldman
its so odd to me
this fuss over school prayer
as if anyone
jews muslims whatever
would mind if their children
prayed in the classroom
its insane
agador laughs
thank you agador spartacus
you may go
hes very nice
but such a problem
we never know
what makes him laugh
at least he speaks english
we have been through more chauffeurs
in the last six months
and the maids weve run through
in the last six years
rodney bruno chuck
look you all need more ice
i have a good feeling
about you people
not a lot of clever books
on the shelves
no fancy art on the walls
just the crucifix
and a lot of good
warm family feeling
this is what clinton missed
when he started in on school prayer
and gays in the military
more ice for you
theres an idiotic issue
gays in the military
i mean those haircuts
those uniforms who cares
mom dont talk about things
you dont know about
dont patronize your mother
shes amazingly intelligent
i think homosexuality
a lot more ice for you
more for me dad
is one of the things
weakening this country
really
thats what i thought until i found
out alexander the great was a fag
talk about gays in the military
how about those dolphins
ill get it
i think were skirting an issue here
that has mr coleman very nervous
you must have heard about
how senator jackson died
oh that
yes what an ugly story
of course we dont
believe a word of it
what do you mean
he was obviously framed
i for one would like an autopsy
mom
thats just what
rush limbaugh said
excuse me
the tension its like riding a
psychotic horse toward a burning stable
dinner is going to be late okay
cause you give me
so little time to shop
barbaras nice
i owe it to val
growing up the way he did
it cant have been easy
im sorry to laugh at miss albert
but what is that hairdo
fuck it its one night
i can live through it
of course its wrong
to kill an abortion doctor
many prolifers i dont agree with
them but they feel that if you
im here son
stop the doctors
you stop the abortions
thats ridiculous
the doctors are only doing their jobs
better to kill the mothers
that will stop them
may i see you a moment dear
i know i know if you kill the
mother the fetus dies too
but the fetus is going to be aborted
so let it go down with the ship
i really must see you now
excuse me
i assure you
mother is just following a train
of thought to its logical
yet absurd conclusion
as jonathan swift did
when he suggested
irish peasants feed
their babies to the rich
i dont know about jonathan swift
but i know one thing about your mother
shes a passionate woman
who follows her heart and i love her
so goldman owns the club
lives above it owns the
building and hes gay
we are in enquirer heaven
i could have danced all night
i could have danced all night
and still have begged for more
you have a beautiful voice
i could have spread my wings
and done a thousand things
ive never done before
your mother should know
i want a career and marriage
barbara albert isnt my mother
hes a drag queen
thats right i keep forgetting
he just sounds so much
like a mother
i only know
when he began to dance with me
i could have danced danced danced
all night
bravo

agador spartacus
thank you thank you all

seafood chowder
isnt that an egg
what
an egg
why yes it is it is a huevo
this is so guatemala
they put eggs in
everything down there
because chicken is
so important to them
its their only real currency
a woman is said to be
worth her weight in hens
a mans wealth is measured
by the size of his cock
will you excuse me
what the hell is this
sweet and sour peasant soup
whyd you say it was seafood chowder
what the hell is that
i dont know i made it up
god this is a nightmare
slurping noises
where are you
staying in florida
with the jeb bushes
on fisher island
fisher island
such a lovely spot
my parents lived on fisher
island until they died
i thought you were visiting
your parents in palm beach
deep voice what
oh yes uh now
that theyre dead

my mother always said

get buried in palm beach
that way youll have
the best of florida
dad get in there
everything is going to hell
he didnt make an entrée

and hes only 20 so i
music
good god that sounds like
its coming from downstairs
mrs keeley it must be coming
from that nightclub on the corner
this must be the same building
youre joking i always thought
that was someones television set
now mother you know
we live above a nightclub
shes travelled around
the world but deep down
shes still a girl from
grovers corners
im afraid i am a bit naive
dont be ashamed of grovers corners
its not a chateau but its a
darn good place to call home
thank you
i will remember that
of course armand is much more
sophisticated than i am
but then he comes
from such good stock
just like those two
adorable youngsters
dont you agree
wheres the bathroom
val ill show you
no i want mother coleman to show me
my dear child
one kiss darling
im only going to the bathroom
val well all go
albert
i think youre all crazy
my men
barbara isnt this wonderful
all of us together
albert this is so moving
i think im going to cry
something very
strange is going on
i know
i mean that dinner
i know there was something
on those bowls
and the son disappearing
while we were eating
i know just whats going on
its the oldest story in the world
what is it
shes a small town girl
and hes a pretentious european
the worst kind
him and his cole dwhatever
and his decadent china
ive seen it all before
aristotle onassis was like this
and all of the french
especially mitterrand
and the english
not margaret thatcher of course
but i bet john major has something
on the side and she cant handle it
who
mrs coleman
why should she care
about john major
no mrs coleman
cant handle him
coleman and his nasty
little european traditions
and his snobbery and that dig
about grovers corners
kevin youre rambling
well it makes me furious
the contempt he has for her
did you see him when she talked
he looked almost frightened
he wont let her run the house
hes in the kitchen he serves
he tells that beige
savage what to do
what
im so sorry
ive ruined everything
dont be silly noone noticed the wig
wheres the spirit gum
they took everything away
i have a barrette if you dont move
your head it might work
thank you
youre a very sweet girl
im so sorry val
you didnt have this kind of sympathy
for poor bessie jackson
bessie jackson is an
insensitive cow
this woman is a lady
you know shell be your inlaw too
if hes so terrible maybe your
daughter shouldnt marry his son
hes not terrible in that way
he wont get mixed up in some scandal
ive never really seen you before
what do you mean
i dont even know who you are
all you think about is your career
and poor little mrs coleman
oh please youre just as worried
about my career as i am
youre the one who pushed for the
marriage barbara can handle that boy
shes a modern woman
tough as nails
mrs coleman is just
very vulnerable
it just breaks my heart they dont
