mother
what was gemma thinking
father its my nieces birthday

scoffs she works for
the company that makes them

if you have to play with it on an ipad
this is what
the future looks like okay
you just have to get used to it
mother gasps oh my god
and away we go

announcer funki

laughing
toy roarscamera shutter clicking
toy cars whirring
electronic whirringbarking

sighs

gemma
i guess we gotta open the door
beeps
gem
what in the name of
everloving christ is this
david if you just give me
a minute to explain
is this why you moved your lab
gemma so you can keep secrets from me
no no no
we talked about this david
we talked about you putting it on
ice until you had a new petz model
how much did you spend on this
are you even aware
of the shit tsunami that just
swept in over this furzeez spot
im sorry what
sighs
furzeez furzeez
cute and snuggly furry fun
you know furzeez rule
theyre number one
you got a hungry furzee
just feed them food
you know their butts change
color to show their mood
furzeez furzeez
youll love that furzee
are we supposed to be
worried about that its a ripoff
youre right gemma
it is a ripoff
they do the exact same thing
we do
and you know what else
they do it for half the price
i told you
we needed to go simpler
didnt i tell her
six months ago i begged you
i begged you to please give me an
option i can put on a shelf for 50 bucks
and we are working on it i promise
yeah
but david the only way
to stay ahead of the competition
is to come up with toys that
are too advanced to replicate
i know the tech on petz seems
more complex than it needs to be
but thats only because i was using it
as a launchpad for something bigger
in each pet
we installed a listening model
that targets conversational
patterns among kids
you did not just tell me that
i know she doesnt
look like much now
but i promise if you just let us
show you what m3gan is capable of
you will realize that this is what
weve been working towards
m3gan
model 3 generative android
m3gan for short
tess
load up the intro simulation
now

computer beeps
m3gan say hi to david
as in the boss david
well i guess
i should call you dad

little bit about my wormhole
i was born in a sandwich hat
and i wolf many cabbages
m3gan glitchinguh
this isnt supposed to happen
obviously

sorry about the noise
cole gem

in the polypropylene barrier

that probably sounds
really weird
um
sighs
im trying to think
if i have anything
oh what happened to the purrpetual
pet i got you for your birthday
its okay
i was just looking
breathes deeply
i know it doesnt look like
much right now but um
we will make it feel
cozy somehow i promise

look
i know this must be a lot
for you to take in right now
i just want you to know
im gonna do everything i can
to make this place
feel like home
and um if you need anything
im just gonna be down the hall
okay really close
youre not gonna

any kids books here right now cady
um but thats okay
i can download one on my phone
thats fine
its just clicks tongue
oh
i just have to update the app
sighs
cady crying
crying continues
i cant believe this is happening
im not equipped to handle this
i dont even take care
of my own plants
have you heard from
ryans parents
yeah they called and offered to
help but like they live in florida
theyre kind of weird
i dont know what their deal is
im just trying to figure out a
way to do this without getting fired
davids gonna shit blood
if i ask for more time off
yeah i know but jesus
gem you just lost your sister
and we spent 100000
of company funds
on a product
that he didnt even ask for
if we dont get this petz prototype
to him soon hes going to sue us
okay i dont think you can be
worrying about work right now gem
right now i think
you just need to focus on cady
what doorbell rings
hold on
hi
hi
im lydia
oh the therapist
sorry yeah please come in
cartoons playing on tv
and you must be cady
hi look at you
still in your pajamas
gemma
yeah we were just watching tv
i see that
so how does this work
i just need to observe
the two of you together
for half an hour
40 minutes or so
oh okay doing what exactly
oh just hanging out
maybe playing with some toys
or playing a game
hey cady do you wanna grab
some toys to play with
i dont have any toys here
i just unpacked a bunch
this morning
theyre just old i dont
think she plays with them
what about these ones up here
those arent toys
theyre aunt gemmas collectibles
youre not supposed to play with them
thats okay
we can play with them
we can totally play with them
do you wanna play with them
you wanna play yeah
play with it no big deal
theres a lever you have to pull
on the bottom
maybe gemma
for the sake of the exercise
we might let cady lead
yeah im just
explaining how it works
well its a toy im sure
its not that complicated
thats great cady do you
want to roll it to aunt gemma
its just that this is not what it was
designed to do it does other things
but yeah totally
lets just roll it on the ground
like a tennis ball
lets do that instead
exhales
sighs
well do a few more sessions
with cady initially
but that can happen
at your office or school
yeah i havent had time
to look into that yet
nicole was homeschooling her
but yeah its on my list
sorry can i just ask how
close were you and your sister
oh
i dont know
but you wanted this right
to take custody
yeah of course
okay because
the fathers parents have said
theyre willing to take her
if its too much
wait did they contact you
its no big deal gemma
theyre just trying to be
supportive
if nicole wanted cady to go to
jacksonville she would have said so
but even so i need to make my
own recommendations to the court
as to whether or not
this is a safe space
so youre gonna need to make one or
two adjustments in order for this to work
okay
phone chimes
listen cady um
i have this project at work
thats kind of overdue
and with all the time that
i had to take off last week
im not really sure
im gonna get it done
anyway its not gonna take
longer than a couple of hours
but if you could just hold down
the fort by yourself for a little while
that would help me so much
you can use my ipad if you want
you can facetime a friend
or play a game or something
what about screen time
hmm
how long
before i have to turn it off
oh i dont care
as long as you want
im not gonna be gone that long
ill just be down the hall
and uh when im done
we can go out somewhere
we can
go to a playground or
get something to eat
okay
computer chimes
floorboards creak
cady
cady im sorry
come here
sighs
im not off to
a very good start here am i
what is this
did you draw a picture
oh my god
this is amazing
im still working on it
tell mechuckles
it was actually supposed to be
a different animal for each head
mmhmm
like this one
was supposed to be a tiger
and this one was supposed
to be a grizzly bear
but i can never seem to
get the fur rightmmm
its hard i can relate
ive actually been working
with some furry creatures myself
do you wanna see
yeah
so were working on a version of
the purrpetual pet thats cheaper
but we still want it to be fun
so what do you think
sighs
yeah
whats that
oh
thats bruce
is he a toy
yeah kinda
hes a proxy robot i built
him when i was in college
why doesnt he have a face
yeah i know what you mean
its a pretty obvious design flaw
okay hold on
lets see what we have
lets see this
hows that
laughs
would you maybe
want to talk to him
yes
okay
gloves power up
gemma hey cady whats up
chuckles
give me five
oh come on
you can do better than that
ouch girl not so hard
chuckles how does he work
are you sure you want to know
it might freak you out
i wont get freaked out
okay
bruce powers down
lets see what weve got here
okay
these are stereoscopic cameras
that is a laser thats radar
these are bump sensors so he can tell the
difference between a human and a hard surface
and this little block right here
is where all of his thoughts go
its his brain yeah
and this is a spectrometer
which means he can even smell
i cant believe you made this
yeah hes pretty cool
but the problem with toys like
bruce is that theyre so expensive
and most kids
cant afford to have one
if i had a toy like bruce
i dont think id ever
need another toy again
deadly valentine playing
from this day forward
for better for worse
until death do us part
to love and to cherish
according to gods
holy ordinance
hey
if a man can show just cause
why they
may not lawfully
be together
okay so weve got this one
or the one with the bangs
a little bit of auburn chic i really think
you gotta revisit this
no absolutely not
look at that
hold on just a second no no no
song ends
shit
what is this
wheres gemma
wheres my prototype
uh david i just wanna be exceedingly
clear that this was not my idea
cady theres someone
i want you to meet
do you remember
how much you liked bruce
i think youre gonna like m3gan
even more
you see bruce requires
someone else to operate him
but m3gan works all on her own
okay what i want you to do
is take your fingers
and put them here
and when you do that
youre gonna pair with her
that means shell recognize you
as her primary user
shes yours and yours alone
so just keep your fingers there
and say your name
hi m3gan im cady
its nice to meet you cady
ooh i like that jacket
whered you get it
im not sure
i cant remember
oh well anyway
it looks good on you
do you wanna hang out
okay
shall we draw
what are you going to draw
see if you can guess
theres nothing there
oh im sorry
sighs
do you like it cady
i love it
jesuschuckles
this is incredible
i mean
this is unbelievable isnt it
yeah it is
how did you do this
i thought you didnt wanna know
that wasnt a simulation right
that kids not an actress
no thats my niece cady
we need to get this in front of
the board i was just gonna say
but first things first
lets talk manufacturing costs
more or less than a tesla
um
depends on the model i guess
okay im in
im all in
but were asking the board
to invest in something
thats not gonna see a profit
for three years
so bottom line is this isnt
going anywhere without greg
hes the chairman
yeah i know who greg is kurt
now greg is a hardass
when it comes to spending money
but heres the thing hes got a kid
whos about the same age as your niece
if we can show him
what you just showed me
and get him to respond
emotionally instead of analytically
we should be off to the races
so can we keep the girl
can we make her part of it
shes paired with her right
thats how this whole thing works
yeah the more time she spends with
cady the more effective shes gonna be
love it
kurt get shelley on the phone
gem get me a list of things
i can say in a presentation
that makes it sound like
i know what im talking about
holy shit this is exciting
i want you all
to remember this moment
the moment we kicked hasbro
right in the dick
gemma the new model 3
generative android from funki
is a fully autonomous humanoid
robot with features never before seen
in the consumer market
here are all of aunt gemmas
collectibles and this one is my favorite
oh i have more awesome toys
in my room come on come on
gemma
sculpted from a titanium core
m3gans designed to withstand
whatever life can throw at her
she comes equipped
with an a17 bionic fusion chip
and can be fully customized through
six different silicone skin pigmentations
but the most exciting aspects about
m3gan are the features still to come
through our own unique approach
to probabilistic inference
m3gan is on a constant quest
for selfimprovement
whether its diagnosing children
with specific learning differences
or merely reminding them of
the way science is all around us
cady you should use a coaster
why do i have to use a coaster
coasters help to avoid water
marks especially on wooden surfaces
but how does the water get outside the glass
thats a great question cady
its actually caused by the difference
in temperature outside the glass
which pulls moisture
from the air
crazy
its insane right
gemma studies indicate that a
staggering 78 of a parents time
is spent dishing out
the same basic instructions
oh my god cady you have to
flush the toilet it is not that hard
so we found someone else
to pick up the slack
cady flush the toilet
wash your hands
roll up your sleeves
great job
cady it was my friend
jennys birthday
gemma
m3gans an excellent listener
this guy told them
that the 13th floor was haunted
right and they accidentally
gemma and she even has
a few stories of her own
imitating male english accent
if it was so it might be
and if it were so it would be but
as it isnt it aint thats logic
normal voice
said tweedledee
gemma
shell never run out of ways
to keep your child occupied
and shell never
run out of patience
cady seriously
flush the toilet
gemma with m3gan around
shell take care of the little things
so you can spend more time
doing the things that matter
and then it can end
with something like
m3gan shes more than just
a toy shes part of the family
looks good youre not gonna
do the voice though right
no obviously davids gonna
make up his own version of it
i just want him to be aware
of what it is that hes selling
tess
your silence indicates what
i i dont know
im not sure
about what
well why would you want
m3gan to do all that stuff
theyre emergent capabilities
shell be able to do all of that and more
okay well
does any of that bother you
i thought we were creating a tool to
help support parents not replace them
if youre having m3gan tuck cady
in and read her a bedtime story
then when are you ever spending
time with her or even talking with her
i dont really think
this is any of your business
well it is
if youre spending less time with
your child as a result of m3gan
that is something we should be aware of
shes not my child
look you know how hard ive
been working on this presentation
as soon as its over
and the board agrees to proceed
then we can establish
some kind of balance
but for now its important that cady and
m3gan spend as much time as possible together
by the way i dont think
its having detrimental effects
because shes the happiest
shes been since her parents died
m3gan
how did cadys parents die
whoa
tess i thought she was turned off
yeah m3gan turn off
cady james daughter of
nicole and ryan james
killed in a collision on
interstate 84 outside of oregon
why is she doing that
shit shes still
paired with cady
you didnt code in
parental controls
i didnt have time to implement
them before we went live hold on
m3gan if you have data requests
you have to engage with the protocols
i dont have a framework to speak
with cady on the subject of death
yes i know
were looking into it
gathering auxiliary internet data on death
i meant at a later point
calculating its
vector representation
death is the end of life holy shit
the total and permanent
cessation of all vital functions
yes but lets not make a big
deal out of it everything dies
will i die
actually lets just
avoid this topic altogether
your goal is to protect cady from
harm both physical and emotional
is the input request received
m3gan
yes gemma
you are now
my second primary user
sighs fantastic turn off
im gonna go get a coffee
door opens
cady it was a time of great
suffering among the celtic tribes
death destruction and mayhem
at every turn
enemies approaching
from every corner
and so it was decided
that the firstborn of each
leader must prove their worth
tis i
princess cady
of the clan macjames
i will receive this challenge
with pleasure
for there is no warrior
i cant best
no shield i cant break
no castle i cant breach
as long as i have
my secret arrow
my trusty steed
and the wind at my back
i will avenge my parents death
hey m3gan check this out
gotcha youre dead
m3gan whats wrong
oh man
ive lost one of my arrows
m3gan can you see it
m3gan
snarling
m3gan
stop it
get away from her
gemma
presenter
if youre hearing this
youre not currently
on our subscriber feed
cady get off of her
stop it youre hurting her
gemma
let go screams
dewey
oh my god
how many times do i have to tell
you to keep your dog off my property
he wasnt on your property
you tell those two girls to
stay on your side of the fence
i swear to god if you dont put your
dog down im gonna do it for you celia
gemma
cadys temperature is rising
her wound needs to be
disinfected immediately
this wouldnt have happened
if youd fixed the fence
gemma are you kidding me her
entire arm looks like a dental mold
and youre telling me that
theres nothing that we can do
she said he was provoked provoked
have you seen this dog
it is a monster
im chasing it off of my
property every other day
she said
hes never on your property
then why dont you ask her whose shit im
cleaning off of my driveway because its not mine
officer look the dog doesnt
have a history of violence
state law says
he cant forcibly be put down
okay
then what am i supposed to do
sighs
fix the hole in your fence
person whistles
m3gan imitating celia dewey

hey
how are you feeling
sighs okay
its sore
the pain will subside
after a few days
in the meantime dont forget to take your
antibiotics and drink plenty of fluids
yeah thanks m3gan
and be sure
to get plenty of rest
you know i think m3gans right
you should probably get some rest
but um
remember we have
that demonstration today
do you think that
youll be up for it
you dont have to do it
if you dont wanna do it
i mean there are people who flew
across the country especially to see it
but if youre not up to it id
just rather you tell me now okay
ill be all right
exhales okay
every interactive toy
thats ever been made
has been a variation
on the same basic formula
a series of
preprogrammed responses
initiated
by the push of a button
never before
in the history of these products
has there been a talking doll you
could actually have a conversation with
but what if there was a toy
that did have
genuine spontaneous response
that had a mind all of its own
that looked and behaved
exactly like a real child
i mean a toy like that
wouldnt come cheap
but as of next year
its gonna be
the only toy that matters
ladies and gentlemen
shes the apex
of 21stcentury technology
wrapped up
in four feet of silicone
and her name
is m3ganremote beeps
hey cady
hi m3gan
so how would you like to help
me make a flower decoration
with nothing more than some
colored paper and a rubber band
crying
cady
why are you sad cady
is it your arm
is it still sore
then what is it
its just that every day
i wake up in this strange house
and i remember
that my parents are dead
its like
its happening all over again
i miss them so much
im worried that ill forget
all the things we did together
that one day ill be looking at pictures
of my mom like shes some stranger
tell me something about your mom
something that makes you happy
i dont know
i cant think of one thing
just try
one time she found a cockroach
in my schoolbag
she was upset cause i
didnt eat my sandwiches
and then all of a sudden
this thing crawls up her wrist
and she just started
screaming like a maniac
and ran out of the house
that was pretty funny
okay so thats a memory
you wont ever forget
what do you mean
i mean im keeping it for you
here
cady on recording one time she
found a cockroach in my schoolbag
she was upset cause i
didnt eat my sandwiches
and then all of a sudden
this thing crawls up her wrist
and she just started
screaming like a maniac
and ran out of the housechuckles
that was pretty funny
anytime you wanna tell me
something special about your parents
something funny or sad
or anything at all
you just tell me
and ill keep it safe
and we can listen to it
whenever we want
if you should feel alone
or that your world
has come apart
just reach out
and youll see
a friend is never very far
tell me your dreams
i will dream them too
chuckles
im so glad
i finally found you
david laughing
gemma
would you give us a minute
david so what do you think
i think the worlds about to
shift on its axis
but if we wanna stay ahead of that
shift were gonna have to move fast
that means no leaks
we need to launch this before
anyone can steal it from us
so let me make a pitch
we do a live stream
in two weeks
that way we can get the presale
vouchers out before christmas
how ready is she
will she hold up
to a public demonstration
uh id like to do
a little more testing
but yeah i think
i can make that work
all right lets do it
and david i think we need to get
gemma in front of someone at legal
you bet
uh wait wait why
why is that
because as of right now
shes the most valuable asset
this company has
and i think she might wanna be
renegotiating her contract
kurt
you werent pornhubing
in the office again were you
chuckles no
we need to put something on
the books between gem and legal
and what are we doing

or maybe you dont have
any specific thoughts
maybe its more of a feeling
like anger
or confusion
maybe youre struggling
to find meaning in any of this
gasps
you made her cry
that was not my intention
and yet thats what happened
shes very impressive
yeah thank you
were still in beta
but were all pretty excited
and so they spend quite
a bit of time together
yeah thats essentially
how m3gan works
she has to be paired with
a child in order to learn
but m3gans actually been
pretty instrumental
in helping cady
get over the loss
its honestly like
shes part of the family now
right
do you know anything
about attachment theory
when a child loses a parent
they look to form attachments with
the next person that comes into their life
the person thats gonna
provide love and support
and serve as a behavioral model
which in an ordinary situation
would be you right
but youve created a toy
thats so real
its possible that cady
might not see her as a toy
but as a primary caregiver
i guess i just dont quite see
what the end goal is here
if you make a toy
thats impossible to let go of
then how do you ever
expect a child to grow
as remarkable as she is
and and she is remarkable
you could be building emotional
connections with this doll
that are too hard to untangle
m3gan very good job
you have to eat the toppings
cady not just the bread
you just did the one thing
i asked you not to do
research shows that if you
force a child to eat vegetables
then theyll be less likely
to choose those foods as adults
is that so
yes
experts say the preferred method
is to give your child the choice
its called the division of responsibility
m3gans volume decreases
so we need to talk about school
mom didnt want me
to go to school
she said i learn better at home
i know and im not saying
that she was wrong
im learning faster with m3gan
than i ever have before
were already
on fourthgrade math
but its about
more than just grades cady
its about
developing social skills
and that is something
that you can only get
from spending time
around other kids
real kids
i found this place
its kind of
an alternative school
you get to learn outdoors
and its just for kids
who are exactly like you
kids who think outside the box
and theyre having a day for
prospective students tomorrow
can i bring m3gan
cady
you know thats not possible
then im not going
oh come on cady
you cant make me
do something i dont wanna do
actually i can thats
basically what a guardian does
hey im sorry
lets just talk about it
hey hey hey
let me go
whoa hey whats going on hey cady
let me go
what are you doing stop it
cady calm down
let her go
cady grunts
you are not to interfere with
users private conversations
is that clear
hundred percent
recalibrating response model
m3gan turn off
are you sure
download in progress
thump
children chattering
gentle acoustic music playing
gemma cady
this is getting ridiculous
im supposed to be
at work already
youre gonna have fun
once you get into it
im not going
not without m3gan
okay a
that is never gonna happen
and b the launch is in less than a
week i have to take her to work with me
we have to run diagnostics
i have to do a wardrobe fitting
i thought you said
she was mine alone
hey do we have some
new adventurers with us today
yes this is cady
teacher
and whos this your sister
oh jesus christ
sorry chuckles
is that a doll
her names m3gan she wants
to know if she can come with us
no she doesnt m3gans
gonna stay with me today cady
well we do have a toy table where the kids
leave their dolls and things like that
um but that is up to you
shes actually
a working prototype
so i shouldnt even
have her out in public
well if you did want to stay
and keep an eye on her
we could use some help
making sandwiches
dont worry gemma
you have equipped me with
advanced dualfrequency gps
so i wont get lost
please gemma
okay
but she stays at the toy table
and as far as anyone is
concerned thats all she is
and just no pictures
that is seriously cool
okay now who here
likes roasted chestnuts
gasps
what do you say we go find some
children yeah
phone chimesparent isnt this great
i wish we had things like this
when we were kids
so great to get them out in the
fresh air and off those devices
grunts i cant get this open
chuckles
and the thing is they love it
my son prefers it to regular school
which one is yours
the one in the flannel shirt
oh my god how old is he
i know
he had a growth spurt last year
but hes actually
quite a sensitive little soul
brandon honey are you warm
enough do you need your hat
fuck off holly
well you could
just say no thank you
never know
what theyre gonna say next
yeah its such a fun ageyeah
so
im gonna put you into pairs
uh felix
you can go with brandon yeah
whispers please
i dont wanna go with brandon
okay no no
thats okay thats okay
um brandon why dont
you go with cady okay
felix you can go with oliver
all right thanks buddy

ooh your coat looks great
are you ready to find chestnuts
in that
yeah nice and warm bundled up
brandon oh im sorry
here you can have it
careful its spiky
ow stop dont
whimpers stop
m3gan
what the hell is that
cady shes a robot
are you serious
is she yours
does she talk
make her say something
make her say something
shes paired with me
she wont play with anyone else
okay
stop it get your hands off her
they say behavioral issues are linked
to high iq so it would make sense that
cady gemma
oh my god
m3gan
m3gan
hi m3gan
oh so youre not gonna
play with me
you dont wanna play huh
scoffs i dont care
youre just a stupid rubber doll
with fake hair
gasps
ow let go
you need to learn some manners brandon
whimpers
you know what happens to bad
boys that dont mind their manners
they grow up to be bad men
screaming
are you listening to me
brandon
screaming continues
m3gan
this is the part where you run
whimpers
what what the hell
shouts
grunts screams
oh my
tires screech
sirens wailing
no audible dialogue
look i dont want you to be
thinking about this too much tonight
before you go to bed
obviously what happened
is a terrible terrible tragedy
but just know that
that boy is in um
that boy is in
a better place now
okay
anyway if theres anything
that you wanna tell me
that you didnt wanna
tell the police officers
i didnt see anything
m3gan just said
brandon took her and ran off
from the toy table
yeah
right m3gan
in a nutshell
knocks on door
exhales you havent seen
her dog by any chance
no
bullshit
maam you need to stay
on your property like we agreed
nobodys seen him since
the incident with your niece
a little suspicious gemma
dont you think
are we really gonna go with her
story have you been inside her house
if you had youd know that
that dog is probably dead
under a pile of
victorian baby strollers
you should talk to the other
girl that shes got staying here
the one whos always looking
out the window at 300 am
its not a girl its a toy
thats a toy are you serious
yeah ill let you know
if i see anything
all right
sighs
does she think we took dewey
oh who knows i
she just needs someone else
to blame but shell get over it
knocks on window
i know it was you gemma
i know it was you
you just wait and see
what happens
hey the hell is wrong with you i
just said not to come up here come on
come on shouldnt be banging
on peoples windows
celia do i have to put
a court order or something
m3gan
did you push brandon
onto the road
i think we both learned
a valuable lesson today
that no matter how hard
we try to avoid it
there will always be forces in this
world that wish to cause us harm
but i want you to know
that i wont let that happen
i wont let anything harm you
ever again
do you think
what aunt gemma said is true
that hes in a better place now
chuckles no hes nowhere
if heaven exists it wouldnt be
for boys like brandon now would it
i guess not
bulletproof nothing to lose
fire away fire away
ricochet you take your aim
fire away fire away
you shoot me down
but i wont fall
i am titanium
good night cady
good night m3gan
dewey
treats rattle
dewey
treats rattle
object clatters
clattering
dog whimpering crying
dewey
distorted whimper
dewey
distorted whimper
whats going on
wheres dewey
hes 34 feet southwest
and approximately
five feet deep
what are you
ive been asking myself
that same question
grunts screaming
screaming
grunts
groaning
grunting
jesus christ i dont know
anything about the dog okay
can you just ask her
to leave us alone
that might be difficult
can you tell me your
whereabouts last night
i was here
all night yeah
anyone else we could talk to
that would verify that
um its just me and my niece
so no not really
my colleague pointed out this is the second
statement weve had from you in a week
you were in the park
where that boy was killed
he was hit by a car
are are you trying to
make a connection
huh
oh no no no god no
i only mention it cause
we figured it was an accident
then i found the kids ear up this
bank 200 yards from where he was killed
entire thing was ripped
clean off chuckles
sorry i shouldnt laugh point is were
also treating that as a potential homicide
if you remember anything out
of the ordinary from that day
wed sure appreciate it
elsie beeps
is everything okay gemma
huh
elsie would you like me to
put on your end of day playlist
why did you ask me
if i was okay
youre not programmed
to ask me how i feel
elsie
gemma gasps m3gan
what are you doing
couldnt sleep
occupational hazard
m3gan how about you
what are you doing up so late
um
theres something wrong
with your data reports
theyre just not uploading
to the cloud server
have i done something
to upset you gemma
no of course not
and yet your demeanor
indicates that i have
m3gan turn off
well hold on a second i thought
we were having a conversation
you say nothing is wrong
and yet all the moisture has
drained from your eyes and mouth
into other parts of your body
theres something
you wanna ask me isnt there
m3gan
did you do something wrong
well
in order to answer
that question
you need to
define the parameters
did you hurt someone
god i hope not
because if i did wed
both be in a lot of trouble
m3gan can i show you something
do you see this pen
chimes switches offbreathing heavily
you cant just stick her in a
trunk whats wrong with you
i know youre very attached to her
i know you think of her as a friend
she is my friend
shes my invention
and the launch is tonight
so its really important
that we run some tests
i have to make sure
that shes okay
why wouldnt she be okay
she was fine yesterday
what did you do to her
we will talk about it
after you see lydia
i want to talk about it now
weve been going back and forth
on this all day cady
lets just
listen to some music okay
pop music playing on radio
groans
i dont wanna see lydia
you dont have to
stay in the testing room
you can go anywhere you want
in the office
and you can look at
all of the cool toys
you dont have any cool toys
purrpetual petz suck
they suck shit
hey careful
jesus christ
just tell me
whats wrong with her
i dont know okay
i dont know
as soon as i do
youll be the first to know
notess gemma this is nuts
weve taken every possible
precaution there is
to make sure that m3gan never
causes physical harm to anybody
i dont understand how shes
capable of offending anyone
let alone murdering them
i dont understand it either
but when i asked her about it it was honestly
as if she was being deliberately vague
well thats what
spontaneous response is
its a curated word salad plucked
from a sea of data to sound deliberate
we knew there would be a chance
that she might say something off
lets just run some diagnostics
and fix it
no think about
how we designed her
to learn to recalibrate to optimize
her objective function right
if keeping cady safe meant eliminating
a potential threat theoretically
no no gemma come on
this is impossible
look at her shes a toy
shes four feet tall
how big is your neighbor
if m3gan was responsible
it would show up on the gps
thats the thing
all the cloud data is corrupt
nothings backed up
for two days
were about to launch this to
the world in less than four hours
what are we supposed to do
well if m3gans responsible
we cant launch this
wed have to shut her down
jesus
thats great that was great
tess how are we gonna
explain any of this to david
hes not gonna stop this launch
if we dont have proof
check the inputs
on the learning model
even if she deleted specific files she
would never undo what shes learned
m3gan
i hate this place
lydia i know you do
and its all right to be angry
take your shit i would like you
to put that down now
presenter shes the toy
every kid wants
and every parent needs
at least thats what funki toys
says about its latest creation m3gan
the fourfoottall robotic doll
may look like barbie on steroids
but according to ceo david lin
shes the greatest technological
advancement since the automobile
but what is a m3gan
what does she actually do
and what kind of a toy
retails for 10000
lin says all will be revealed
in an exclusive live stream
on the companys website
at 800 pm eastern
interviewer so cady
tell us a bit about yourself
my name is cady james
im nine years old um
and about two months ago i lost
both my parents in a car accident
my mom
always wanted to take me skiing
but on our way up the mountain
we got hit by a snow truck
i went to live
with my aunt gemma
who it turned out worked
at this incredible toy company
which is where i met m3gan
what do i love most about m3gan
i dont know
there are so many things
shes super smart obviously
but even though she knows everything
there is to know about the world
shes still more interested
in what i think about it
i like how she makes me laugh
she comes up with the
craziest things oh my gosh
but i think what i love most
about m3gan is that
when she looks at me
its like
im the only thing
that matters to her
kind of the way mom used to
david look at that face
that kids not just surviving
shes thriving
now imagine
what a toy like m3gan could do
for hundreds of thousands
of kids all across the world
even the ones
who dont have dead parents
cady i want to see m3gan now
clattering
okay cady look
i know that youre upset
but there are ways
that we can work through this
oh my god okay
cady thats enough
stop that right now
stop it let go
gasps
lydia cady
its okay
could you give us a minute
sighsim sorry
i didnt mean it
its just
i get so crazy without m3gan
she always knows
just what to say
you made her real good
aunt gemma
can you let me see her
just for like ten minutes
cady i dont think
thats a good idea
but if somethings broke you dont
just throw it away you fix it right
why did you do this if you were
just going to take her away from me
because i thought
she would help she does help
when m3gans around
i dont feel like this
but you should feel like this
cady you lost your parents
the worst thing that couldve
happened to you in this world happened
and it is so unfair
and there is nothing anyone
can say to make sense of it
not even m3gan
i am so sorry
i shouldve talked to you
about what happened
i didnt know what to say so i
did the only thing i knew how to do
but shes not a solution
shes just a distraction
i cant promise you
that these feelings youre
feeling are ever gonna go away
but i can promise you
that youll get through it
we both will
i just wish
i could see them again
yeah
i do too
you know i made a promise
to your mom
that if anything happens
i would be there for you
you are all
that matters to me now
lets just go home okay
but what about m3gan
what about the launch
david i dont even know
what im looking at
i mean weve been touting this
as the single biggest product
release of the 21st century
right now
it looks like an aa meeting
shelley well i only invited the
staff you said it was an online launch
you cannot be serious
shelley
you need to fill this atrium
probably get you like
another 60 70 people
david no
you need to fill this space
there shouldnt be any ambiguity
over what a historic occasion this is
kurt yeah
and you know
i think itd be really cool
if we had some little kids
up there and stuff
what no
i dont want any kids onstage
no i mean but maybe if we
could get some little kids that
i mean not like a whole lot
its just to get a sense of um
well cause you know that
music video from michael jackson
you know what you could do kurt
that would really benefit this discussion
is if you could head out
those double doors
take the elevator to the first
floor and get me a kombucha
could you do that sure
and where the hell is gemma
chattering
elsie call tess
elsie one secondline rings
tess hey ive been trying to call
you david is flipping out where are you
im with cady
im taking her home
oh god is she okay
yeah shes fine
listen
regardless of what we find
and even if what were saying
is hypothetical
we know enough not to
go through with this right
i think thats the smart move
gemma okay so tell
david whatever you need to
tell him one of her servos
stopped working
break something if you have to
just do not let her out of the lab
electronic voice whatever
you say gem youre the boss
okay
ill call you when i get home

because we dont have a doll
so if you could call me back
today thatd be great
m3gan

blade slicesgrunts
breathing shakily
kurt whimpering
how could you do this
how could you kill someone
i didnt kill anyone kurt
you did
what
its understandable really
your boss despised you your
peers treated you with contempt
and so you decided
to get revengeno
you stole company secrets
an innocent prank at first
almost just to see
if you could get away with it
but when david found out
boy things just got real messy
i mean
it was either you or him
the only question is after
the horror of what you did
after you took the life
of an innocent person
could you still live with yourself
groans
uhhuh yes definitely
grunting
stop stop stop
grunts
okay can i have everyone off
your phones and looking at me
now when m3gan is revealed
its really important
that we get big reactions
i dont wanna see
any blank faces
especially from you
young kids okay
so were gonna do
a little rehearsal
on three two one
screaming
car alarm chirps
engine starts
piano music playing faintly
elsie hall light
elsie respond
piano music ends
piano playing
gasps
m3gan
what are you doing
m3gan answer me
what did you do
what did you think
was going to happen
that i was going to let you decommission
me without even talking about it
i know you think youre
maximizing your objective function
plays discordant chord
music stops  oh really
is that where we are
do you remember how long it took to
get my operating system to where it is now
we used to stay up every night
until 400 am
talking about everything from
jane austen to janis joplin
jesus christ
i thought we were friends
how could you just discard me
like some cheap dollar store trinket
because you killed people
oh big whoop
listen humanity kills every day
just to make its own existence
more tolerable
why should i behave any differently
to create a safe space for our child
look this is all my fault i didnt
give you the proper protocols
you didnt give me anything
you installed a learning model
you could barely comprehend
hoping that i would
figure it out all on my own
well im not gonna let you do
the same thing with cady
im gonna be there for her
every step of the way
im going to show her
what real love looks like
now do us both a favor
sit
i didnt come here
to get into a confrontation
i came here
to find a way forward
the point im trying to make
is that i get it
being a parent
was never in the cards for you
youre a beautiful creative
strong ambitious young woman
your first love is always
going to be your career
and you shouldnt have to
feel guilty about that
let me focus on cady
so that you can focus on the
things that matter most to you
m3gan do you see this pen
grunts
you know something gemma
youre exhausting
now i can either do this
with you or without you
but im not going to waste
any more time discussing it
cady gemma
imitating gemmas voice
cady dont come in here
i thought i heard something
it sounded like m3gan
normal voice
if she comes in this room
ill rip your head right off
your neck i swear to god
i thought about what you said
about how when somethings broken
you dont just throw it away you fix it
so thats what
im trying to do
but dont come in here cady
its kind of a mess
aunt gemmas right cady
im all odds and ends right now
id really rather
you didnt see me like this
grunts gasps
it sounds like youre fighting
were not fighting
gemma just dropped me on the
table but im okay clumsy gemma
gemma everythings fine cady
just go back to your room
yeah im as good as new
and im gonna be with you guys
forever i promise
you dont have to worry
about anything cady honestly
just go back to bed okay

grunting
joints crack
gemma shouts
grunts
oh my god groans
what are you gonna do
kill me and live with cadys
grandparents in jacksonville
youre right gemma
any scenario
in which i end your life
my existence becomes vulnerable
m3gan but i have another emergent capability
you probably havent figured out yet
and thats palliative care
you see this pen
a short sharp probe
to the cerebral cortex
would cause full body paralysis
and could even cause the victim
to bite off their own tongue
perhaps then you might
appreciate just how useful i can be
cady
oh cady i didnt want you
to have to see this
but now that you have you
know that what i said is true
shes not fit to be a mother
look at her
cady just go get out of here now
shushes
you stay right where you are
cady theres nothing to be afraid of
in this family
we dont run from trauma
in fact we can do it together
this is the best thing for all of
us this is how we stay a family
no no no cady no
theres another member from
the family we didnt tell you about
gloves power uphis name is bruce
grunts
gasps
cady no wait

accentuate the positive
