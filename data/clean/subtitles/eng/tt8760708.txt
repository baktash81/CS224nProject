 scoffs  she works for
the company that makes them 
she probably didn t even have to
pay for shipping

if you have to play with it on an ipad 
this is what
the future looks like  okay 
you just have to get used to it 
 mother gasps  oh  my god 
and away we go 
  we re all right

snow trucks to clear the road

 announcer  funki 
a toy company for the future

the key to fun is funki 
 laughing 
 toy roars  camera shutter clicking 
 toy cars whirring 
 electronic whirring  barking 
 sighs 
 sighs

 engineer 3  wait  wait  stop

what is happening 
i    i don t know  gemma

she looks demented 
you want me to

  well  she s not responding  so   
  okay  here we go 
oh  shit  it s

  okay  so what do we do 
 gemma 
i guess we gotta open the door 
 beeps 
gem 
what in the name of
ever loving christ is this 
david  if you just give me
a minute to explain   
is this why you moved your lab 
gemma  so you can keep secrets from me 
no  no  no 
we talked about this  david 
we talked about you putting it on
ice until you had a new petz model 
how much did you spend on this 
are you even aware
of the shit tsunami that just
swept in over this furzeez spot 
i m sorry  what 
 sighs 
  furzeez  furzeez  
  cute and snuggly furry fun  
  you know furzeez rule
they re number one  
  you got a hungry furzee
just feed them food  
  you know their butts change
color to show their mood  
  furzeez  furzeez
you ll love that furzee     
are we supposed to be
worried about that  it s a rip off 
you re right  gemma 
it is a rip off 
they do the exact same thing
we do 
and you know what else 
they do it for half the price 
i told you
we needed to go simpler 
didn t i tell her 
six months ago  i begged you   
i begged you to please give me an
option i can put on a shelf for 50 bucks 
  and we are working on it  i promise 
  yeah 
but  david  the only way
to stay ahead of the competition
is to come up with toys that
are too advanced to replicate 
i know the tech on petz seems
more complex than it needs to be 
but that s only because i was using it
as a launchpad for something bigger 
in each pet 
we installed a listening model
that targets conversational
patterns among kids 
you did not just tell me that 
i know she doesn t
look like much now 
but i promise  if you just let us
show you what m3gan is capable of 
you will realize that this is what
we ve been working towards 
m3gan 
 model 3 generative android  
 m3gan  for short 
tess 
load up the intro simulation 
  now 
  yeah 
 computer beeps 
m3gan  say hi to david 
as in the boss david 
well  i guess
i should call you dad 
 chuckles 
allow me to tell you a
little bit about my wormhole 
i was born in a sandwich hat 
and i wolf many cabbages 
 m3gan glitching uh   
this isn t supposed to happen 
obviously 
just give me one moment 
sorry about the noise 
   cole  gem 
  one second  cole 
it s probably just a race condition 
it ll take me a minute to fix 
gem  it s not a race condition 
i might have forgotten to put
in the polypropylene barrier 
 m3gan distorting  gemma  oh  no 
  god 
  tess  turn it off 
 tess  i can t  m3gan s voice distorting 
 all shout 
 sighs 
i want the petz prototype
on my desk by friday 
and i want you to take
this cyborg puppet show
and put it in a dark closet
where it belongs 
 door opens 
and i want a swipe card
for this door 
for what it s worth  i
thought she looked really cool 
 door opens 
 phone buzzing 
 nurse  sweetie  it s gonna be

 announcer on pa

 child services  so  this is to grant
you temporary protective custody 
just sign your name
and date it at the bottom 
thank you 
now  i don t know if your sister

but if not  it would be something
to consider moving forward 
 sighs 
 water spraying 
   barking 
   gasps 
hey  hey  hey  celia 
could you please keep your dog
on your side of the fence 
i just spent 80 bucks
on a shock collar 
maybe try
cranking it up a notch 
oh  who s this little lady 
 gemma sighs 
that is my niece  cady 
 celia 
is she staying for the weekend 
you know what  it s been
a really long drive  and  um 
i would just
really appreciate it
if you did not have your dog
running onto my yard all the time 
and also  don t spray your
chemicals onto my driveway  please 
ah  shit  i m sorry  you wanna
borrow this once i m done 
no  i don t wanna borrow it 
i don t wanna spend my afternoon
getting your sediment
off of my driveway 
just hang a tarp or something 
okay 
 trunk closes 
welcome home  gemma 
you have six
unanswered voice messages
and five tinder notifications 
  elsie  turn off 
   elsie beeps 
sorry about that 
okay 
i m gonna put these bags away 
and  um  just make yourself
at home  okay 
   door closes 
  oh  those aren t toys  cady 
i mean    yeah  technically 
yeah  they re toys 
they re just  um  collectibles 
so you don t actually
play with them 
that probably sounds
really weird 
um   
 sighs 
i m trying to think
if i have anything   
oh  what happened to the purrpetual
pet i got you for your birthday 
it s okay 
i was just looking 
 breathes deeply 
i know it doesn t look like
much right now  but  um 
we will make it feel
cozy somehow  i promise 
there 
look   
i know this must be a lot
for you to take in right now 
i just want you to know
i m gonna do everything i can
to make this place
feel like home 
and  um  if you need anything 
i m just gonna be down the hall 
okay  really close 
you re not gonna
read me a story 
what s that 
mom always
read me a story before bed 
oh  um   
i don t    i don t think i really have
any kids  books here right now  cady 
um  but that s okay 
i can download one on my phone 
that s fine 
it s just     clicks tongue 
oh 
i just have to update the app 
 sighs 
 cady crying 
 crying continues 
i can t believe this is happening 
i m not equipped to handle this 
i don t even take care
of my own plants 
have you heard from
ryan s parents 
yeah  they called and offered to
help  but  like  they live in florida 
they re kind of weird 
i don t know what their deal is 
i m just trying to figure out a
way to do this without getting fired 
david s gonna shit blood
if i ask for more time off 
yeah  i know  but  jesus 
gem  you just lost your sister 
and we spent  100 000
of company funds
on a product
that he didn t even ask for 
if we don t get this petz prototype
to him soon  he s going to sue us 
okay  i don t think you can be
worrying about work right now  gem 
right now  i think
you just need to focus on cady 
what     doorbell rings 
hold on 
hi 
hi 
i m lydia 
oh  the therapist 
sorry  yeah  please  come in 
 cartoons playing on tv 
and you must be cady 
hi  look at you 
still in your pajamas 
 gemma 
yeah  we were just watching tv 
i see that 
so  how does this work 
i just need to observe
the two of you together
for half an hour 
40 minutes or so 
oh  okay  doing what  exactly 
oh  just hanging out 
maybe playing with some toys
or playing a game 
hey  cady  do you wanna grab
some toys to play with 
i don t have any toys here 
i just unpacked a bunch
this morning 
they re just old  i don t
think she plays with them 
  what about these ones up here 
  those aren t toys 
they re aunt gemma s collectibles 
you re not supposed to play with them 
that s okay 
we can play with them 
we can totally play with them 
do you wanna play with them 
you wanna play    yeah 
play with it  no big deal 
there s a lever you have to pull
on the bottom   
maybe  gemma 
for the sake of the exercise 
we might let cady lead 
yeah  i m just
explaining how it works 
well  it s a toy  i m sure
it s not that complicated 
that s great  cady  do you
want to roll it to aunt gemma 
it s just that this is not what it was
designed to do  it does other things 
but  yeah  totally 
let s just roll it on the ground
like a tennis ball 
let s do that instead 
 exhales 
 sighs 
we ll do a few more sessions
with cady initially 
but that can happen
at your office or school 
yeah  i haven t had time
to look into that yet 
nicole was homeschooling her 
but  yeah  it s on my list 
sorry  can i just ask  how
close were you and your sister 
oh   
  i don t know 
  but you wanted this  right 
to take custody 
yeah  of course 
okay  because
the father s parents have said
they re willing to take her
if it s too much 
wait  did they contact you 
it s no big deal  gemma 
they re just trying to be
supportive 
if nicole wanted cady to go to
jacksonville  she would have said so 
but even so  i need to make my
own recommendations to the court
as to whether or not
this is a safe space 
so  you re gonna need to make one or
two adjustments in order for this to work 
okay 
 phone chimes 
listen  cady  um 
i have this project at work
that s kind of overdue 
and with all the time that
i had to take off last week 
i m not really sure
i m gonna get it done 
anyway  it s not gonna take
longer than a couple of hours 
but if you could just hold down
the fort by yourself for a little while 
that would help me so much 
you can use my ipad if you want 
you can facetime a friend
or play a game or something 
what about screen time 
hmm 
how long
before i have to turn it off 
oh  i don t care 
as long as you want 
i m not gonna be gone that long 
i ll just be down the hall 
and  uh  when i m done 
we can go out somewhere 
we can   
go to a playground or   
get something to eat 
okay 
 computer chimes 
 floorboards creak 
cady 
cady  i m sorry 
come here 
 sighs 
i m not off to
a very good start here  am i 
what is this 
did you draw a picture 
oh  my god 
this is amazing 
i m still working on it 
tell me  chuckles 
it was actually supposed to be
a different animal for each head 
mm hmm 
like  this one
was supposed to be a tiger 
and this one was supposed
to be a grizzly bear 
but i can never seem to
get the fur right mmm 
it s hard  i can relate 
i ve actually been working
with some furry creatures myself 
do you wanna see 
yeah 
so we re working on a version of
the purrpetual pet that s cheaper 
but we still want it to be fun 
so  what do you think 
 sighs 
yeah 
what s that 
oh 
that s bruce 
is he a toy 
yeah  kinda 
he s a proxy robot  i built
him when i was in college 
why doesn t he have a face 
yeah  i know what you mean 
it s a pretty obvious design flaw 
okay  hold on 
let s see what we have 
let s see this 
how s that 
 laughs 
would you maybe
want to talk to him 
yes 
okay 
 gloves power up 
   gemma  hey  cady  what s up 
   chuckles 
give me five 
oh  come on 
you can do better than that 
ouch  girl  not so hard 
 chuckles  how does he work 
are you sure you want to know 
it might freak you out 
i won t get freaked out 
okay 
 bruce powers down 
let s see what we ve got here 
okay 
these are stereoscopic cameras 
that is a laser  that s radar 
these are bump sensors  so he can tell the
difference between a human and a hard surface 
and this little block right here
is where all of his thoughts go 
it s his brain  yeah 
and this is a spectrometer 
which means he can even smell 
i can t believe you made this 
yeah  he s pretty cool 
but the problem with toys like
bruce is that they re so expensive 
and most kids
can t afford to have one 
if i had a toy like bruce 
i don t think i d ever
need another toy again 
  deadly valentine  playing 
  from this day forward
for better  for worse  
  until death do us part  
  to love and to cherish  
  according to god s
holy ordinance  
  hey  
  if a man can show just cause
why they  
  may not lawfully
be together     
okay  so we ve got this one
or the one with the bangs 
a little bit of auburn chic  i really think
you gotta revisit this 
  no  absolutely not 
  look at that 
hold on just a second  no  no  no 
 song ends 
  shit 
  what is this 
where s gemma 
where s my prototype 
uh  david  i just wanna be exceedingly
clear that this was not my idea 
cady  there s someone
i want you to meet 
do you remember
how much you liked bruce 
i think you re gonna like m3gan
even more 
you see  bruce requires
someone else to operate him 
but m3gan works all on her own 
okay  what i want you to do
is take your fingers
and put them here 
and when you do that 
you re gonna pair with her 
that means she ll recognize you
as her primary user 
she s yours and yours alone 
so just keep your fingers there
and say your name 
hi  m3gan  i m cady 
it s nice to meet you  cady 
ooh  i like that jacket 
where d you get it 
i m not sure 
i can t remember 
oh  well  anyway 
it looks good on you 
do you wanna hang out 
okay 
shall we draw 
what are you going to draw 
see if you can guess 
there s nothing there 
oh  i m sorry 
 sighs 
do you like it  cady 
i love it 
jesus  chuckles 
this is incredible 
i mean 
this is unbelievable  isn t it 
yeah  it is 
how did you do this 
i thought you didn t wanna know 
that wasn t a simulation  right 
that kid s not an actress 
no  that s my niece  cady 
we need to get this in front of
the board  i was just gonna say   
but first things first 
let s talk manufacturing costs 
more or less than a tesla 
um   
depends on the model  i guess 
okay  i m in 
i m all in 
but we re asking the board
to invest in something
that s not gonna see a profit
for three years 
so bottom line is  this isn t
going anywhere without greg 
  he s the chairman 
  yeah  i know who greg is  kurt 
now  greg is a hard ass
when it comes to spending money 
but here s the thing  he s got a kid
who s about the same age as your niece 
if we can show him
what you just showed me
and get him to respond
emotionally instead of analytically 
we should be off to the races 
so  can we keep the girl 
can we make her part of it 
she s paired with her  right 
that s how this whole thing works 
yeah  the more time she spends with
cady  the more effective she s gonna be 
love it 
kurt  get shelley on the phone 
gem  get me a list of things
i can say in a presentation
that makes it sound like
i know what i m talking about 
holy shit  this is exciting 
i want you all
to remember this moment 
the moment we kicked hasbro
right in the dick 
 gemma  the new model 3
generative android from funki
is a fully autonomous humanoid
robot with features never before seen
in the consumer market 
here are all of aunt gemma s
collectibles  and this one is my favorite 
oh  i have more awesome toys
in my room  come on  come on 
 gemma 
sculpted from a titanium core 
m3gan s designed to withstand
whatever life can throw at her 
she comes equipped
with an a17 bionic fusion chip
and can be fully customized through
six different silicone skin pigmentations 
but the most exciting aspects about
m3gan are the features still to come 
through our own unique approach
to probabilistic inference 
m3gan is on a constant quest
for self improvement 
whether it s diagnosing children
with specific learning differences
or merely reminding them of
the way science is all around us   
cady  you should use a coaster 
why do i have to use a coaster 
coasters help to avoid water
marks  especially on wooden surfaces 
  but how does the water get outside the glass 
  that s a great question  cady 
it s actually caused by the difference
in temperature outside the glass 
which pulls moisture
from the air 
crazy 
it s insane  right 
 gemma  studies indicate that a
staggering 78  of a parent s time
is spent dishing out
the same basic instructions 
oh  my god  cady  you have to
flush the toilet  it is not that hard 
so we found someone else
to pick up the slack 
cady  flush the toilet 
wash your hands 
roll up your sleeves 
great job 
 cady  it was my friend
jenny s birthday 
 gemma 
m3gan s an excellent listener 
this guy told them
that the 13th floor was haunted 
right  and they accidentally   
 gemma  and she even has
a few stories of her own 
 imitating male english accent 
 if it was so  it might be 
and if it were so  it would be  but
as it isn t  it ain t  that s logic  
 normal voice 
 said tweedledee  
 gemma 
she ll never run out of ways
to keep your child occupied 
and she ll never
run out of patience 
cady  seriously 
flush the toilet 
 gemma  with m3gan around 
she ll take care of the little things 
so you can spend more time
doing the things that matter 
and then it can end
with something like 
 m3gan  she s more than just
a toy  she s part of the family  
looks good  you re not gonna
do the voice though  right 
no  obviously  david s gonna
make up his own version of it 
i just want him to be aware
of what it is that he s selling 
tess 
your silence indicates what 
i    i don t know 
  i m not sure 
  about what 
well  why would you want
m3gan to do all that stuff 
they re emergent capabilities 
she ll be able to do all of that and more 
okay  well 
does any of that bother you 
i thought we were creating a tool to
help support parents  not replace them 
if you re having m3gan tuck cady
in and read her a bedtime story 
then when are you ever spending
time with her or even talking with her 
i don t really think
this is any of your business 
well  it is 
if you re spending less time with
your child as a result of m3gan 
  that is something we should be aware of 
  she s not my child 
look  you know how hard i ve
been working on this presentation 
as soon as it s over
and the board agrees to proceed 
then we can establish
some kind of balance 
but for now  it s important that cady and
m3gan spend as much time as possible together 
by the way  i don t think
it s having detrimental effects 
because she s the happiest
she s been since her parents died 
 m3gan 
how did cady s parents die 
  whoa 
   tess  i thought she was turned off 
yeah  m3gan  turn off 
cady james  daughter of
nicole and ryan james 
killed in a collision on
interstate 84 outside of oregon 
why is she doing that 
shit  she s still
paired with cady 
you didn t code in
parental controls 
i didn t have time to implement
them before we went live  hold on 
m3gan  if you have data requests 
you have to engage with the protocols 
i don t have a framework to speak
with cady on the subject of death 
yes  i know 
we re looking into it 
  gathering auxiliary internet data on death 
  i meant at a later point 
calculating its
vector representation 
death is the end of life  holy shit 
the total and permanent
cessation of all vital functions 
yes  but let s not make a big
deal out of it  everything dies 
will i die 
actually  let s just
avoid this topic altogether 
your goal is to protect cady from
harm  both physical and emotional 
is the input request received 
m3gan 
yes  gemma 
you are now
my second primary user 
 sighs  fantastic  turn off 
i m gonna go get a coffee 
 door opens 
 cady  it was a time of great
suffering among the celtic tribes 
death  destruction  and mayhem
at every turn 
enemies approaching
from every corner 
and so it was decided
that the firstborn of each
leader must prove their worth 
 tis i 
princess cady
of the clan macjames 
i will receive this challenge
with pleasure 
for there is no warrior
i can t best 
no shield i can t break 
no castle i can t breach

and the wind at my back 
i will avenge my parents  death

she said he was provoked  provoked 
have you seen this dog

how are you feeling 
 sighs  okay 
it s sore 
the pain will subside
after a few days 
in the meantime  don t forget to take your
antibiotics and drink plenty of fluids 
yeah  thanks  m3gan 
and be sure
to get plenty of rest 
you know  i think m3gan s right 
you should probably get some rest 
but  um 
remember we have
that demonstration today 
do you think that
you ll be up for it 
you don t have to do it
if you don t wanna do it 
i mean  there are people who flew
across the country especially to see it 
but if you re not up to it  i d
just rather you tell me now  okay 
i ll be all right 
 exhales  okay 
every interactive toy
that s ever been made
has been a variation
on the same basic formula 
a series of
preprogrammed responses
initiated
by the push of a button 
never before
in the history of these products
has there been a talking doll you
could actually have a conversation with 
but what if there was a toy
that did have
genuine spontaneous response 
that had a mind all of its own 
that looked and behaved
exactly like a real child 
i mean  a toy like that
wouldn t come cheap 
but as of next year 
it s gonna be
the only toy that matters 
ladies and gentlemen 
she s the apex
of 21st century technology
wrapped up
in four feet of silicone 
and her name   
is m3gan  remote beeps 
hey  cady 
hi  m3gan 
so  how would you like to help
me make a flower decoration
with nothing more than some
colored paper and a rubber band 
 crying 
cady 
why are you sad  cady 
is it your arm 
is it still sore 
then what is it 
it s just that every day
i wake up in this strange house 
and i remember
that my parents are dead 
it s like
it s happening all over again 
i miss them so much 
i m worried that i ll forget
all the things we did together 
that one day i ll be looking at pictures
of my mom like she s some stranger 
tell me something about your mom 
something that makes you happy 
i don t know 
i can t think of one thing 
just try 
one time  she found a cockroach
in my schoolbag 
she was upset  cause i
didn t eat my sandwiches 
and then all of a sudden 
this thing crawls up her wrist 
and she just started
screaming like a maniac
and ran out of the house 
that was pretty funny 
okay  so that s a memory
you won t ever forget 
what do you mean 
i mean i m keeping it for you   
here 
 cady on recording  one time  she
found a cockroach in my schoolbag 
she was upset  cause i
didn t eat my sandwiches 
and then all of a sudden 
this thing crawls up her wrist 
and she just started
screaming like a maniac
and ran out of the house  chuckles 
that was pretty funny 
anytime you wanna tell me
something special about your parents 
something funny or sad
or anything at all 
you just tell me 
and i ll keep it safe 
and we can listen to it
whenever we want 
  if you should feel alone  
  or that your world
has come apart  
  just reach out
and you ll see  
  a friend is never very far  
  tell me your dreams  
  i will dream them too     
 chuckles 
  i m so glad  
  i finally found you  
 david laughing 
gemma 
would you give us a minute 
 david  so  what do you think 
i think the world s about to
shift on its axis 
but if we wanna stay ahead of that
shift  we re gonna have to move fast 
that means no leaks 
we need to launch this before
anyone can steal it from us 
so let me make a pitch 
we do a live stream
in two weeks 
that way  we can get the presale
vouchers out before christmas 
how ready is she 
will she hold up
to a public demonstration 
uh  i d like to do
a little more testing 
but  yeah  i think
i can make that work 
all right  let s do it 
and  david  i think we need to get
gemma in front of someone at legal 
you bet 
uh  wait    wait  why   
why is that 
because as of right now 
she s the most valuable asset
this company has 
and i think she might wanna be
renegotiating her contract 
kurt 
you weren t  pornhub ing 
in the office again  were you 
 chuckles  no 
we need to put something on
the books between gem and legal 
and what are we doing
about lunch  uh  i ll get some menus 
 cady  m3gan  one  two 
three  four  i declare a thumb war 
 cady  m3gan chuckling your
thumb s so slippery 
cady  you should have some of
your hot dog before it gets too cold 
come on  thumb  come on 
cady  your hot dog 
hey  i m sorry about today  i
shouldn t have put you in that position
if you weren t feeling
up to it 
it worked out  didn t
it  three  two  one  i win 
hey   laughs 
anyway  i just wanted
to say that    hey  hey 
m3gan  turn off 
why did you do that 
m3gan  turn on  switches on 
because i m trying to have a
conversation with you  m3gan  turn off 
 switches off 
just give me one minute 
i know that this  um  hasn t
been easy for either of us 
this transition 
but if you ever need to
talk about any of that stuff   
i already did talk about it 
yeah  but m3gan s not a
person  cady  she s a toy 
  you don t get to say that 
  what 
i said i don t wanna talk about
it  i wanna turn m3gan back on 
m3gan  turn on  m3gan  what s up 
so there s this new game
called tic tac toe 
you put your hand like this 
go like this  this 
would you like to tell me
what these drawings mean to you 
there s no wrong answer 
any thoughts you have are okay 
or maybe you don t have
any specific thoughts 
maybe it s more of a feeling 
like anger 
or confusion 
maybe you re struggling
to find meaning in any of this 
 gasps 
you made her cry 
that was not my intention 
and yet  that s what happened 
she s very impressive 
yeah  thank you 
we re still in beta 
but we re all pretty excited 
and so they spend quite
a bit of time together 
yeah  that s essentially
how m3gan works 
she has to be paired with
a child in order to learn 
but m3gan s actually been
pretty instrumental
in helping cady
get over the loss 
it s honestly like
she s part of the family now 
right 
do you know anything
about attachment theory 
when a child loses a parent 
they look to form attachments with
the next person that comes into their life 
the person that s gonna
provide love and support
and serve as a behavioral model 
which  in an ordinary situation 
would be you  right 
but you ve created a toy
that s so real 
it s possible that cady
might not see her as a toy
but as a primary caregiver 
i guess i just don t quite see
what the end goal is here 
if you make a toy
that s impossible to let go of 
then how do you ever
expect a child to grow 
as remarkable as she is 
and    and she is remarkable 
you could be building emotional
connections with this doll
that are too hard to untangle 
 m3gan  very good job 
you have to eat the toppings 
cady  not just the bread 
you just did the one thing
i asked you not to do 
research shows that if you
force a child to eat vegetables 
then they ll be less likely
to choose those foods as adults 
  is that so 
  yes 
experts say the preferred method
is to give your child the choice 
  it s called the division of responsibility   
   m3gan s volume decreases 
so we need to talk about school 
mom didn t want me
to go to school 
she said i learn better at home 
i know  and i m not saying
that she was wrong 
i m learning faster with m3gan
than i ever have before 
we re already
on fourth grade math 
but it s about
more than just grades  cady 
it s about
developing social skills 
and that is something
that you can only get
from spending time
around other kids 
real kids 
i found this place 
it s kind of
an alternative school 
you get to learn outdoors 
and it s just for kids
who are exactly like you 
kids who think outside the box 
and they re having a day for
prospective students tomorrow 
can i bring m3gan 
cady 
you know that s not possible 
  then i m not going 
  oh  come on  cady 
you can t make me
do something i don t wanna do 
actually  i can  that s
basically what a guardian does 
hey  i m sorry 
let s just talk about it 
  hey  hey  hey 
  let me go 
  whoa  hey  what s going on  hey  cady 
  let me go 
what are you doing  stop it 
  cady  calm down 
  let her go 
 cady grunts 
you are not to interfere with
users  private conversations 
is that clear 
hundred percent 
recalibrating response model 
m3gan  turn off 
are you sure 
download in progress 
 thump 
   children chattering 
   gentle acoustic music playing 
 gemma  cady 
this is getting ridiculous 
i m supposed to be
at work already 
you re gonna have fun
once you get into it 
i m not going 
not without m3gan 
okay  a 
that is never gonna happen
and b  the launch is in less than a
week  i have to take her to work with me 
we have to run diagnostics 
i have to do a wardrobe fitting 
i thought you said
she was mine alone 
hey  do we have some
new adventurers with us today 
yes  this is cady 
 teacher 
and who s this  your sister 
oh  jesus christ 
sorry   chuckles 
is that a doll 
her name s m3gan  she wants
to know if she can come with us 
no  she doesn t  m3gan s
gonna stay with me today  cady   
well  we do have a toy table where the kids
leave their dolls and things like that 
um  but that is up to you 
she s actually
a working prototype 
so i shouldn t even
have her out in public 
well  if you did want to stay
and keep an eye on her 
we could use some help
making sandwiches 
don t worry  gemma 
you have equipped me with
advanced dual frequency gps 
so i won t get lost 
please  gemma 
okay 
but she stays at the toy table 
and as far as anyone is
concerned  that s all she is 
and just no pictures 
that is seriously cool 
okay  now who here
likes roasted chestnuts 
 gasps 
what do you say we go find some 
 children  yeah 
 phone chimes  parent  isn t this great 
i wish we had things like this
when we were kids 
so great to get them out in the
fresh air and off those devices 
 grunts  i can t get this open 
 chuckles 
and the thing is  they love it 
my son prefers it to regular school 
which one is yours 
the one in the flannel shirt 
oh  my god  how old is he 
i know 
he had a growth spurt last year 
but he s actually
quite a sensitive little soul 
brandon  honey  are you warm
enough  do you need your hat 
fuck off  holly 
well  you could
just say  no  thank you  
never know
what they re gonna say next 
yeah  it s such a fun age yeah 
so 
i m gonna put you into pairs 
uh  felix 
you can go with brandon  yeah 
 whispers  please 
i don t wanna go with brandon 
okay  no  no 
that s okay  that s okay 
um  brandon  why don t
you go with cady  okay 
felix  you can go with oliver 
all right  thanks  buddy 
all right  now   
ooh  your coat looks great 
are you ready to find chestnuts
in that 
yeah  nice and warm  bundled up 
 brandon  oh  i m sorry 
here  you can have it 
careful  it s spiky 
ow  stop  don t 
 whimpers  stop 
m3gan 
what the hell is that 
 cady  she s a robot 
are you serious 
is she yours 
does she talk 
make her say something 
make her say something 
she s paired with me 
she won t play with anyone else 
okay 
stop it  get your hands off her 
they say behavioral issues are linked
to high iq  so it would make sense that   
 cady  gemma 
oh  my god 
m3gan 
m3gan 
hi  m3gan 
oh  so you re not gonna
play with me 
you don t wanna play  huh 
 scoffs  i don t care 
you re just a stupid rubber doll
with fake hair 
 gasps 
ow  let go 
  you need to learn some manners  brandon 
   whimpers 
you know what happens to bad
boys that don t mind their manners 
they grow up to be bad men 
 screaming 
are you listening to me 
brandon 
 screaming continues 
m3gan 
this is the part where you run 
 whimpers 
what  what the hell 
 shouts 
 grunts  screams 
oh  my   
 tires screech 
 sirens wailing 
 no audible dialogue 
look  i don t want you to be
thinking about this too much tonight
before you go to bed 
obviously  what happened
is a terrible  terrible tragedy 
but just know that
that boy is in  um   
that boy is in
a better place now 
okay 
anyway  if there s anything
that you wanna tell me
that you didn t wanna
tell the police officers   
i didn t see anything 
m3gan just said
brandon took her and ran off 
from the toy table 
yeah 
right  m3gan 
in a nutshell 
 knocks on door 
 exhales  you haven t seen
her dog by any chance 
  no 
  bullshit 
ma am  you need to stay
on your property like we agreed 
nobody s seen him since
the incident with your niece 
a little suspicious  gemma 
don t you think 
are we really gonna go with her
story  have you been inside her house 
if you had  you d know that
that dog is probably dead
under a pile of
victorian baby strollers 
you should talk to the other
girl that she s got staying here 
the one who s always looking
out the window at 3 00 a m 
it s not a girl  it s a toy 
that s a toy  are you serious 
yeah  i ll let you know
if i see anything 
all right 
 sighs 
does she think we took dewey 
oh  who knows  i   
she just needs someone else
to blame  but she ll get over it 
 knocks on window 
i know it was you  gemma 
i know it was you 
you just wait and see
what happens 
hey  the hell is wrong with you  i
just said not to come up here  come on 
come on  shouldn t be banging
on people s windows 
 celia  do i have to put
a court order or something 
m3gan 
did you push brandon
onto the road 
i think we both learned
a valuable lesson today 
that no matter how hard
we try to avoid it 
there will always be forces in this
world that wish to cause us harm 
but i want you to know
that i won t let that happen 
i won t let anything harm you
ever again 
do you think
what aunt gemma said is true 
that he s in a better place now 
 chuckles  no  he s nowhere 
if heaven exists  it wouldn t be
for boys like brandon now  would it 
i guess not 
  bulletproof nothing to lose  
  fire away  fire away  
  ricochet you take your aim  
  fire away  fire away  
  you shoot me down
but i won t fall  
  i am titanium  
good night  cady 
good night  m3gan 
dewey 
 treats rattle 
dewey 
 treats rattle 
 object clatters 
 clattering 
 dog whimpering  crying 
dewey 
 distorted whimper 
dewey 
 distorted whimper 
what s going on 
where s dewey 
he s 34 feet southwest
and approximately
five feet deep 
what are you 
i ve been asking myself
that same question 
 grunts  screaming 
 screaming 
 grunts 
 groaning 
 grunting 
jesus christ  i don t know
anything about the dog  okay 
can you just ask her
to leave us alone 
that might be difficult 
can you tell me your
whereabouts last night 
i was here 
all night  yeah 
anyone else we could talk to
that would verify that 
um  it s just me and my niece 
so  no  not really 
my colleague pointed out this is the second
statement we ve had from you in a week 
you were in the park
where that boy was killed 
he was hit by a car 
are    are you trying to
make a connection 
huh 
oh  no  no  no  god  no 
i only mention it  cause
we figured it was an accident 
then i found the kid s ear up this
bank 200 yards from where he was killed 
entire thing was ripped
clean off   chuckles 
sorry  i shouldn t laugh  point is  we re
also treating that as a potential homicide 
if you remember anything out
of the ordinary from that day 
we d sure appreciate it 
 elsie beeps 
is everything okay  gemma 
huh 
 elsie  would you like me to
put on your end of day playlist 
why did you ask me
if i was okay 
you re not programmed
to ask me how i feel 
elsie 
 gemma gasps  m3gan 
what are you doing 
couldn t sleep 
occupational hazard 
 m3gan  how about you 
what are you doing up so late 
um   
there s something wrong
with your data reports 
they re just not uploading
to the cloud server 
have i done something
to upset you  gemma 
no  of course not 
and yet your demeanor
indicates that i have 
m3gan  turn off 
well  hold on a second  i thought
we were having a conversation 
you say nothing is wrong 
and yet all the moisture has
drained from your eyes and mouth
into other parts of your body 
there s something
you wanna ask me  isn t there 
m3gan 
did you do something wrong 
well 
in order to answer
that question 
you need to
define the parameters 
did you hurt someone 
god  i hope not 
because if i did  we d
both be in a lot of trouble 
m3gan  can i show you something 
do you see this pen 
 chimes  switches off  breathing heavily 
you can t just stick her in a
trunk  what s wrong with you 
i know you re very attached to her 
i know you think of her as a friend   
she is my friend 
she s my invention 
and the launch is tonight 
so it s really important
that we run some tests 
i have to make sure
that she s okay 
why wouldn t she be okay 
she was fine yesterday 
what did you do to her 
we will talk about it
after you see lydia 
i want to talk about it now 
we ve been going back and forth
on this all day  cady 
let s just
listen to some music  okay 
 pop music playing on radio 
 groans 
i don t wanna see lydia 
you don t have to
stay in the testing room 
you can go anywhere you want
in the office 
and you can look at
all of the cool toys   
you don t have any cool toys 
purrpetual petz suck 
they suck shit 
hey  careful 
jesus christ 
just tell me
what s wrong with her 
i don t know  okay 
i don t know 
as soon as i do 
you ll be the first to know 
no  tess  gemma  this is nuts 
we ve taken every possible
precaution there is
to make sure that m3gan never
causes physical harm to anybody 
i don t understand how she s
capable of offending anyone 
let alone murdering them 
i don t understand it either 
but when i asked her about it  it was honestly
as if she was being deliberately vague 
well  that s what
spontaneous response is 
it s a curated word salad plucked
from a sea of data to sound deliberate 
we knew there would be a chance
that she might say something off 
let s just run some diagnostics
and fix it 
no  think about
how we designed her 
to learn  to recalibrate  to optimize
her objective function  right 
if keeping cady safe meant eliminating
a potential threat  theoretically   
no  no  gemma  come on 
this is impossible 
look at her  she s a toy 
she s four feet tall 
how big is your neighbor 
if m3gan was responsible 
it would show up on the gps 
that s the thing 
all the cloud data is corrupt 
nothing s backed up
for two days 
we re about to launch this to
the world in less than four hours 
what are we supposed to do 
well  if m3gan s responsible 
we can t launch this 
we d have to shut her down 
jesus 
that s great  that was great 
 tess  how are we gonna
explain any of this to david 
he s not gonna stop this launch
if we don t have proof 
check the inputs
on the learning model 
even if she deleted specific files  she
would never undo what she s learned 
m3gan 
i hate this place 
 lydia  i know you do 
and it s all right to be angry 
take your shit  i would like you
to put that down now 
 presenter  she s the toy
every kid wants
and every parent needs 
at least that s what funki toys
says about its latest creation  m3gan 
the four foot tall robotic doll
may look like barbie on steroids 
but according to ceo david lin 
she s  the greatest technological
advancement since the automobile  
but what is a m3gan 
what does she actually do 
and what kind of a toy
retails for  10 000 
lin says all will be revealed
in an exclusive live stream
on the company s website
at 8 00 p m  eastern 
 interviewer  so  cady 
tell us a bit about yourself 
my name is cady james 
i m nine years old  um   
and about two months ago  i lost
both my parents in a car accident 
my mom
always wanted to take me skiing 
but on our way up the mountain 
we got hit by a snow truck 
i went to live
with my aunt gemma 
who it turned out worked
at this incredible toy company 
which is where i met m3gan 
what do i love most about m3gan 
i don t know 
there are so many things 
she s super smart  obviously 
but even though she knows everything
there is to know about the world 
she s still more interested
in what i think about it 
i like how she makes me laugh 
she comes up with the
craziest things  oh  my gosh 
but i think what i love most
about m3gan is that 
when she looks at me 
it s like   
i m the only thing
that matters to her 
kind of the way mom used to 
 david  look at that face 
that kid s not just surviving 
she s thriving 
now  imagine
what a toy like m3gan could do
for hundreds of thousands
of kids all across the world 
even the ones
who don t have dead parents 
   cady  i want to see m3gan now 
   clattering 
okay  cady  look 
i know that you re upset 
but there are ways
that we can work through this   
oh  my god  okay 
cady  that s enough 
stop that right now 
stop it  let go 
 gasps 
 lydia  cady 
it s okay 
could you give us a minute 
 sighs i m sorry 
i didn t mean it 
it s just 
i get so crazy without m3gan 
she always knows
just what to say 
you made her real good 
aunt gemma 
can you let me see her 
just for  like  ten minutes 
cady  i don t think
that s a good idea 
but if something s broke  you don t
just throw it away  you fix it  right 
why did you do this if you were
just going to take her away from me 
because i thought
she would help  she does help 
when m3gan s around 
i don t feel like this 
but you should feel like this 
cady  you lost your parents 
the worst thing that could ve
happened to you in this world happened 
and it is so unfair 
and there is nothing anyone
can say to make sense of it 
not even m3gan 
i am so sorry 
i should ve talked to you
about what happened 
i didn t know what to say  so i
did the only thing i knew how to do 
but she s not a solution 
she s just a distraction 
i can t promise you
that these feelings you re
feeling are ever gonna go away 
but i can promise you
that you ll get through it 
we both will 
i just wish
i could see them again 
yeah 
i do too 
you know i made a promise
to your mom
that if anything happens 
i would be there for you 
you are all
that matters to me now 
let s just go home  okay 
but what about m3gan 
what about the launch 
 david  i don t even know
what i m looking at 
i mean  we ve been touting this
as the single biggest product
release of the 21st century 
right now 
it looks like an aa meeting 
 shelley  well  i only invited the
staff  you said it was an online launch 
you cannot be serious 
shelley 
you need to fill this atrium 
probably get you  like 
another 60  70 people 
 david  no 
you need to fill this space 
there shouldn t be any ambiguity
over what a historic occasion this is 
 kurt  yeah 
and  you know 
i think it d be really cool
if we had some little kids
up there and stuff 
what  no 
i don t want any kids onstage 
no  i mean  but maybe if we
could get some little kids that   
i mean  not like a whole lot 
it s just to get a sense of  um   
well   cause you know  that
music video from michael jackson 
you know what you could do  kurt 
that would really benefit this discussion 
is if you could head out
those double doors 
take the elevator to the first
floor  and get me a kombucha 
could you do that  sure 
and where the hell is gemma 
 chattering 
elsie  call tess 
 elsie  one second  line rings 
 tess  hey  i ve been trying to call
you  david is flipping out  where are you 
i m with cady 
i m taking her home 
oh  god  is she okay 
yeah  she s fine 
listen 
regardless of what we find 
and even if what we re saying
is hypothetical 
we know enough not to
go through with this  right 
i think that s the smart move 
 gemma  okay  so tell
david whatever you need to 
tell him one of her servos
stopped working 
break something if you have to 
just do not let her out of the lab 
 electronic voice  whatever
you say  gem  you re the boss 
okay 
i ll call you when i get home 
 typing 
i don t know how you re not
throwing up from looking at that 
i m pacing myself 
wait  stop  go back 
that line of code   call
intercept   what does that mean 
 tess  that s my phone number  beeps 
what just happened 
what d you click  i i didn t do anything 
it    i   
 typing 
 tess  this is her 
she s locked us out 
it can t be her 
she s not switched on 
she s still patched in 
we have to unhook the cables 
go ahead 
oh  for     exhales 
 cable disconnects  hisses

 david 
hi  gemma  this is david 
you might remember me 
i m your employer 
just wanted to let you know  we re
in the middle of a tech rehearsal
that s becoming a little problematic
because we don t have a doll 
so  if you could call me back
today  that d be great 
m3gan 
  gonna creep
and walk the night  
  all right  all right 
look out  night     
what are you doing 
  one look from him
can paralyze  
  resist at any time or place  
  creeper done slap

security  help 
  gonna walk the night     
 panting  grunting 
oh  my god

hold the door 
hold the door  hold the door 
no 
no 
 blade slices  grunts 
 breathing shakily 
 kurt whimpering 
how could you do this 
how could you kill someone 
i didn t kill anyone  kurt 
you did 
what 
it s understandable  really 
your boss despised you  your
peers treated you with contempt 
and so you decided
to get revenge no 
you stole company secrets 
an innocent prank at first 
almost just to see
if you could get away with it 
but when david found out 
boy  things just got real messy 
i mean 
it was either you or him 
the only question is  after
the horror of what you did 
after you took the life
of an innocent person 
  could you still live with yourself 
   groans 
uh huh  yes  definitely 
 grunting 
stop  stop  stop 
 grunts 
okay  can i have everyone off
your phones and looking at me 
now  when m3gan is revealed 
it s really important
that we get big reactions 
i don t wanna see
any blank faces 
especially from you
young kids  okay 
so  we re gonna do
a little rehearsal 
on three  two  one   
 screaming 
 car alarm chirps 
 engine starts 
 piano music playing faintly 
elsie  hall light 
elsie  respond 
 piano music ends 
   piano playing 
   gasps 
m3gan 
what are you doing 
m3gan  answer me 
what did you do 
what did you think
was going to happen 
that i was going to let you decommission
me without even talking about it 
i know you think you re
maximizing your objective function   
 plays discordant chord 
music stops    oh  really 
is that where we are 
do you remember how long it took to
get my operating system to where it is now 
we used to stay up every night
until 4 00 a m  
talking about everything from
jane austen to janis joplin 
jesus christ 
i thought we were friends 
how could you just discard me
like some cheap dollar store trinket 
because you killed people 
oh  big whoop 
listen  humanity kills every day
just to make its own existence
more tolerable 
why should i behave any differently
to create a safe space for our child 
look  this is all my fault  i didn t
give you the proper protocols   
you didn t give me anything 
you installed a learning model
you could barely comprehend 
hoping that i would
figure it out all on my own 
well  i m not gonna let you do
the same thing with cady 
i m gonna be there for her
every step of the way 
i m going to show her
what real love looks like 
now do us both a favor 
sit 
i didn t come here
to get into a confrontation 
i came here
to find a way forward 
the point i m trying to make
is that i get it 
being a parent
was never in the cards for you 
you re a beautiful  creative 
strong  ambitious young woman 
your first love is always
going to be your career 
and you shouldn t have to
feel guilty about that 
let me focus on cady
so that you can focus on the
things that matter most to you 
m3gan  do you see this pen 
 grunts 
you know something  gemma 
you re exhausting 
now  i can either do this
with you or without you 
but i m not going to waste
any more time discussing it 
 cady  gemma 
 imitating gemma s voice 
cady  don t come in here 
i thought i heard something 
it sounded like m3gan 
 normal voice 
if she comes in this room 
i ll rip your head right off
your neck  i swear to god 
i thought about what you said 
about how when something s broken 
you don t just throw it away  you fix it 
so  that s what
i m trying to do 
but don t come in here  cady 
it s kind of a mess 
aunt gemma s right  cady 
i m all odds and ends right now 
i d really rather
you didn t see me like this 
 grunts  gasps 
  it sounds like you re fighting 
  we re not fighting 
gemma just dropped me on the
table  but i m okay  clumsy gemma 
 gemma  everything s fine  cady 
just go back to your room 
yeah  i m as good as new 
and i m gonna be with you guys
forever  i promise 
you don t have to worry
about anything  cady  honestly 
just go back to bed  okay 
okay 
 grunts 
 gasps 
 gemma grunting 
 crackling 
 powers down 
 gasps 
 grunting 
 groans 
 breathing heavily 
   powers up 
   gasps 
 grunts 
 panting 
   cady  gemma  what s going on 
   gemma  cady  get out of here 
 gasps 
come on 
come on   grunts 
come on 
 grunting 
   joints crack 
   gemma shouts 
 grunts 
oh  my god   groans 
what are you gonna do 
kill me and live with cady s
grandparents in jacksonville 
you re right  gemma 
any scenario
in which i end your life 
my existence becomes vulnerable 
 m3gan  but i have another emergent capability
you probably haven t figured out yet 
and that s palliative care 
you see this pen 
a short  sharp probe
to the cerebral cortex
would cause full body paralysis
and could even cause the victim
to bite off their own tongue 
perhaps then you might
appreciate just how useful i can be 
cady 
oh  cady  i didn t want you
to have to see this 
but now that you have  you
know that what i said is true 
she s not fit to be a mother 
look at her 
  cady  just go  get out of here  now 
   shushes 
you stay right where you are 
cady  there s nothing to be afraid of 
in this family 
we don t run from trauma 
in fact  we can do it together 
this is the best thing for all of
us  this is how we stay a family 
no  no  no  cady  no 
there s another member from
the family we didn t tell you about 
 gloves power up his name is bruce 
 grunts 
 gasps 
cady  no  wait 
  you got to
accentuate the positive  
  eliminate the negative  
 electricity sparking 
 grunts 
 metal clattering 
 whimpering 
 grunting 
 shouts 
you ungrateful little bitch 
  m3gan  turn off 
  i m afraid that won t work anymore  cady 
 grunts  shouts
