flooded with memories 
i need to expose her
to a new environment 
new things to do   
she d be losing another person
she depends on 
it s only an hour away

to come and see her 
and right now  i need to do
what s right for emily 
i need to be
a full time dad 
i have a surprise for you 
 simple  sweet  mockingbird 
melody playing
