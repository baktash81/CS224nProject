beautiful daughter named fiona 
but she was possessed
by a terrible curse 
by day  a lovely princess 
by night  a hideous ogre 
only true love s kiss
could lift her curse 
so fiona waited in a tower 
guarded by a dragon  until the day
when her true love would arrive 
but as the days turned into years 
the king and queen were forced
to resort to more desperate measures 
whoa  there 
i don t know about this  lillian 
fairy godmother said only true love s
kiss could break fiona s curse 
i don t trust that woman  harold 
this may be our last hope 
besides  he does come
highly recommended by king midas 
but to put our daughter s life
in the hands of this    person 
he s devious 
he s deceitful  he s  he s   
rumpelstiltskin 
mrs  highness 
how do you do 
down  fifi  get down 
as you can see  everything s in order 
so you ll put an end
to our daughter s curse 
and  in return  you sign the kingdom
of far far away over to me 
  lillian  this is madness 
  what choice do we have 
fiona has been locked away
in that tower far too long 
it s not like she s getting any younger 
but to sign over our entire kingdom 
well  if your kingdom s worth
more to you than your daughter   
nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter 
jump  fifi  jump 
just sign it and all your problems
will disappear 
your highness  the princess 
she s been saved 
who saved her 
no one would have guessed
that an ogre named shrek 
whose roar was feared
throughout the land 
would save the beautiful princess fiona 
true love s kiss led to marriage
and ogre babies 
the kingdom of far far away
was finally at peace 
goody for them 
and they lived happily ever after 
sir  you re gonna
have to pay for that 
maybe we could make a deal
for it  little boy 
  oh  i m not a real boy

that showed us you don t have to
change your undies
to change the world 
i wonder what shrek s up to in there 
get in there  get   
impossible to put on 
ok  the dragon goes under the bridge 
through the loop   
   and finally  into the castle

then shrek kissed the princess 
she turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived   
happily

after the party  at home

attraction we live in 
step right up  see the dancing ogre 
don t worry  he won t bite 
i used to be an ogre 
now i m just a jolly green joke 
ok  ok  maybe you re not
the ogre you used to be 
but maybe that s not such a bad thing 
i wouldn t expect you to understand 
it s not like you re a real ogre 
you spent half your life in a palace 
and the other half
locked away in a tower 
look  all i want is for things to go
back to the way they used to be 
back when villagers were afraid of me 
and i could take a mud bath in peace 
when i could do what i wanted 
when i wanted to do it 
back when the world made sense 
you mean back before you
rescued me from the dragon s keep 
exactly 
shrek  you have
three beautiful children 
a wife who loves you 
friends who adore you 
you have everything 
why is it the only person
who can t see that is you 
that s just great 
if she thinks i m gonna
slink back there and apologise 
she s got another thing coming 
she s not the boss of me 
i m an ogre and i m not gonna apologise
for acting like one 
help  please 
someone  anyone at all  help me 
please  help 
please  help 
i m stuck  help 
oh  please  help 
someone  anyone  help me 
the pain  i can see
a bright light  a tunnel 
grandma  is that you 
yeah  it s me  granny 
an ogre  please  mr  ogre 
please don t eat me 
i m not gonna eat you 
but you are an ogre    aren t you 
yeah  well  i    i used to be 
look  move out or get crushed 
so you re not gonna eat me 
no  thanks  i already had a big bowl
of curly toed weirdo for breakfast 
wait up  what s your rush 
where you going 
nowhere 
what a coincidence 
i was just heading that way myself 
but  seriously 
let me give you a ride  i insist 
come on  it s the least i can do
after all you ve done for me 
i got a hot rat cooking 
all right  can i interest you
in a mudslide  slug and tonic 
a liquid libation
to ease that frustration 
  eyeball tini 
  well  maybe just one 
so the centaur says 
 that s not the half i m talking about  
i gotta say  shrek  i envy you 
to live the life of an ogre   
no worries  no responsibilities 
you are free to pillage
and terrorise as you please 
  free  that s a laugh 
  oh  yeah 
sometimes i wish i had just one day
to feel like a real ogre again 
why didn t you say so 
magical transactions are my specialty 
great  next to mimes 
magicians are my favourite people 
hold on 
 king for a month  
 knight for a week  
ogre for a day 
think about it  shrek 
to be feared and hated 
you ll be  like   roar  
and the villagers will be  like   get
away  it s shrek  i m so scared of him  
it would be just like the good old days 
when your swamp was your castle 
  when the world made sense 
  all right  what s the catch 
catch  no  there s no catch 
no catchings  really 
i mean  there s something 
small thing  nothing  a little thing 
all right  i knew it 
so what do you want 
  a day 
  a day 
rat s done 
to make the magic work  you gotta
give something to get something 
in this case  you gotta
give a day to get a day  that s all 
i can t just pick up
and leave my family 
but that s the best part  shrek 
it s a magical contract 
no one will even know you re gone 
and by the time this day is up 
you are gonna feel like a changed ogre 
still  i don t know 
hey  no problem 
forget it  no big d  doesn t matter 
do you like white meat or dark meat 
so what day would i have to give up 
i don t know  any day 
a day from your past 
a day you had the flu 
a day you lost a pet 
a day some meddling oaf
stuck his nose where it didn t belong
destroying your business
and ruining your life  
just for an example 
how about the day i met donkey 
now  there s a day
i d like to take back 
i don t know who that is 
i know  what about a day
you wouldn t even remember 
like a day when you were a baby 
  an innocent  mindless little baby 
  take any of those days you want 
  take them all for all i care 
  oh  just one will do 
ok  good 
a day from your childhood it is 
i guess there s nothing wrong
with wanting a little time for myself 
just 24 tiny little hours 
  i m still my own ogre 
  yeah  you is 
i never needed to ask
for anyone s permission before 
so why start now 
go on  shrek 
sign it 
go on  shrek 
sign it  shrek  sign it 
you signed it 
so  tell me  what happens now 
have a nice day 
i think i fell on my keys

which is why the weasel
goes pop to this very day

personal space is very important to me 
you don t know who i am  do you

brogan  i have news from far far away 
gather the others
and meet me in the war room 
gretched  make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight 
  i need to talk to you 
  what is it 
ok  i know you don t
remember me  but   
   we re married  hear me out 
and at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet 
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks 
and this boy kept saying 
 do the roar  
then i punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing i knew 
my donkey fell in your waffle hole 
right  who s with me 
i guess i must have kicked him
harder than i thought 
fiona  i need to   
witches  all right  everyone 
you know the drill 
  fiona 
  witches  oh  no 
  witches  witches 
  come on  now 
fiona  that s the third patrol today 
we can t hide forever 
trust me  brogan 
after tonight  we won t have to 
  that s your wife 
  that s my wife 
well  i see who wears the chain mail
in your family 
some people like to look
at the goblet as    as half empty 
me  i like to look at it as half full 
we ve gone from the bottom
to the top  ladies 
but we re not just an empire 
we re a family 
everyone has got their cupcake 
cupcake  cupcake  good  yes  baba 
good 
yeah  you know  we have
put away a lot of ogres 
and so one got away 
who cares  it s not a big deal 
it doesn t matter to me 
it s not like it s the end of the world 
except    funny thing 
now that i think about it 
the ogre who got away is shrek 
and if he shares a kiss
with fiona by sunrise 
it is the end of the world  our world 
my empire 
but  as i was saying 
i like to look at the goblet
as half full 
yelling makes me so parched 
would anyone care for some water 
wet your whistle 
a clear  crisp  delicious glass   
   of agua purificada 
anybody s thirsty 
nobody s thirsty  no 
well  then does anyone care to tell me
what it s going to take
to get this ogre  you 
faster brooms 
  no 
  pointier hats 
  no  you 
  maybe we could hire
a professional bounty hunter 
what a world  what a world 
you know  actually
not a bad idea  baba 
i need a bounty hunter 
and if music doth
soothe the savage beast   
   then i think i might know
just the person 
listen up  everyone 
word has come from far far away 
stiltskin is leading
tonight s ogre hunt himself 
  he s never done that before 
  what  why 
i bet that s because of us 
if that cupcake eating clown
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest   
   he ll be vulnerable 
the plan s simple 
if they follow the usual patrol route 
they ll reach the river by midnight 
we ll be concealed along this road 
waiting for his caravan 
once they reach the clearing 
i ll give the signal 
and then we attack 
and when the smoke clears   
wait  what s this 
that s my chimichanga stand 
no  cookie  we won t be needing that 
trust me  fiona  y all gonna be
really hungry after this ambush  ok 
go and finish your little speech 
all right  as i was saying 
when the smoke clears 
rumpelstiltskin is gone
and the chimichangas have been eaten 
far far away will finally be free 
  and so will we 
  spread the word 
we move out as soon as
rumpel leaves the palace 
  man  this is serious 
  tell me about it 
how am i ever gonna
get her to kiss me before sunrise 
actually  i was talking
about the revolution 
revolution 
why don t you just
tell her what you told me 
about how you re her true love and
you came from an alternate universe 
well  while i m at it 
why don t i tell her
that you re married
to a fire breathing dragon
and you have little  mutant
donkey dragon babies 
i do  
you saw what happened 
she s gonna think i m crazy 
i m a daddy 
you know what 
if i got fiona to kiss me once   
   then i can do it again 
shrek  do my babies
have hooves or talons 
donkey

   rallying the troops 
planning attacks

to ease the tension

so let s see what you got

pressed for time 
i am not believing
what i have just witnessed

a spark inside her heart
i thought was long extinguished 
it was as if  for one moment 
fiona had actually found her true love 
i am her true love  i ended her curse 
you know of her curse 
by day  one way  by night another 
this shall be the norm 
until you find true love s first kiss   
   and then take love s true form 
you even know the little rhyme 
it is true  you are the one 
you must prove it to her 
  how 
  convince her 
go to her when she is alone
and tell her something
that only her true love would know 
know about what  
whoa  that s a whole lot of kitty 
shrek  can we keep him

secure your positions 
  it s quite a view from up here 
  what are you doing

you need to know 
once and for all  who i really am 
you are going to ruin everything

actually  i m gonna fix everything   
the ogres  rumpel  your curse

ok  ok  please  fiona   
just hear me out 
i can explain everything 
  where s fiona s signal 
  what s she waiting for 
  he s going to get away 
  no  he s not 
listen  i don t know who you are
or how you know about my curse 
but if any of these ogres
find out i m   
  a beautiful princess 
  that is not who i am  not anymore 
  look  i know you re upset 
  you don t know anything about me 
i know everything about you 
i know you sing so beautifully
that birds explode 
  big deal 
  i know that when you sign your name 
  you put a heart over the  l  
  so what 
i know that when
you see a shooting star 
you cross your fingers on both hands 
squinch up your nose
and you make a wish 
i know that you don t like the covers
wrapped around your feet 
and i know that you sleep by candlelight
because every time
you close your eyes   
   you re afraid you re gonna
wake up back in that tower 
but  most importantly  fiona   
   i know that the reason
you turn human every day   
   is because you ve
never been kissed   
   well   
   by me 
  you move fast 
  it s not me doing the moving 
  why is this happening  
  love 
  no  i m being forced to dance 
  by love 
no  i can t stop myself 
please  make it stop 
i can t control myself 
yeah  cookie s bringing
the heat out of the kitchen 
oh  no  it s the piper 
i can t believe i let this happen 
and it s all because of you 
  if you d just let me kiss you 
  what  you re insane 
we must do something before
they fandango themselves into oblivion 
  what can we do 
  first  you must stop dancing 
when somebody tooties that fluty 
i got to shake my booty 
then it s up to me 
hurry  we must get them
away from the music 
puss and donkey to the rescue 
we saved the day 
donkey    can i borrow your tongue 
say what  
no  hell   
i don t care how big your eyes get 
player  it s not going down 
all right 
stop 
  where are you going 
  to save my friends 
  how  by getting yourself killed 
  if that s what it takes 
puss  say something 
  puss 
  let me explain 
that s how you knew so much about me 
  fiona  wait  kiss me 
  what 
it s the only way to save your friends 
get out of my way 
you used to believe that a single kiss
could solve everything 
i don t understand 
this doesn t make any sense 
true love s kiss
was supposed to fix everything 
yeah  you know 
that s what they told me  too 
true love didn t get me
out of that tower 
i did  i saved myself 
don t you get it 
it s all just a big fairy tale 
fiona  don t say that  it does exist 
how would you know 
did you grow up locked away
in a dragon s keep 
did you live all alone
in a miserable tower 
did you cry yourself
to sleep every night 
waiting for a true love
that never came  
but    but i m your true love 
then where were you
when i needed you 
maybe you kissed her wrong 
no 
the kiss didn t work   
   because fiona doesn t love me 
don t despair  fellow ogres 
they can put us in cages 
but they can t cage our honour 
shrek and fiona are together  
yeah  i ve heard enough of
your toot a lee toots  you blew it 
wolfie  my speech wig 
baba  ready my makeup 
and piper  pull my socks up

   shepherd of your dreams 
recently  a certain somebody
has jeopardised our joyous lives 
and that somebody
is the rat munching ogre called shrek

might seem a little bleak right now 
but things always work themselves
out in the end  you ll see 
  i bet by this time tomorrow   
  don t you understand 
there is no tomorrow 
there s no day after that  and there s
no day after that day after that 
my life was perfect
and i m never going to get it back 
if your life was so perfect  why d you
sign it away to rumpelstiltskin 
because i didn t know
what i had until it was gone  all right 
i didn t know what i had 
surrender now  i m taking you in
