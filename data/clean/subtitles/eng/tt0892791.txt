beautiful daughter named fiona
but she was possessed
by a terrible curse
by day a lovely princess
by night a hideous ogre
only true loves kiss
could lift her curse
so fiona waited in a tower
guarded by a dragon until the day
when her true love would arrive
but as the days turned into years
the king and queen were forced
to resort to more desperate measures
whoa there
i dont know about this lillian
fairy godmother said only true loves
kiss could break fionas curse
i dont trust that woman harold
this may be our last hope
besides he does come
highly recommended by king midas
but to put our daughters life
in the hands of this person
hes devious
hes deceitful hes hes
rumpelstiltskin
mrs highness
how do you do
down fifi get down
as you can see everythings in order
so youll put an end
to our daughters curse
and in return you sign the kingdom
of far far away over to me
lillian this is madness
what choice do we have
fiona has been locked away
in that tower far too long
its not like shes getting any younger
but to sign over our entire kingdom
well if your kingdoms worth
more to you than your daughter
nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter
jump fifi jump
just sign it and all your problems
will disappear
your highness the princess
shes been saved
who saved her
no one would have guessed
that an ogre named shrek
whose roar was feared
throughout the land
would save the beautiful princess fiona
true loves kiss led to marriage
and ogre babies
the kingdom of far far away
was finally at peace
goody for them
and they lived happily ever after
sir youre gonna
have to pay for that
maybe we could make a deal
for it little boy

through the loop
and finally into the castle

attraction we live in
step right up see the dancing ogre
dont worry he wont bite
i used to be an ogre
now im just a jolly green joke
ok ok maybe youre not
the ogre you used to be
but maybe thats not such a bad thing
i wouldnt expect you to understand
its not like youre a real ogre
you spent half your life in a palace
and the other half
locked away in a tower
look all i want is for things to go
back to the way they used to be
back when villagers were afraid of me
and i could take a mud bath in peace
when i could do what i wanted
when i wanted to do it
back when the world made sense
you mean back before you
rescued me from the dragons keep
exactly
shrek you have
three beautiful children
a wife who loves you
friends who adore you
you have everything
why is it the only person
who cant see that is you
thats just great
if she thinks im gonna
slink back there and apologise
shes got another thing coming
shes not the boss of me
im an ogre and im not gonna apologise
for acting like one
help please
someone anyone at all help me
please help
please help

the pain i can see
a bright light a tunnel
grandma is that you

yeah well i i used to be
look move out or get crushed
so youre not gonna eat me
no thanks i already had a big bowl
of curlytoed weirdo for breakfast
wait up whats your rush
where you going
nowhere
what a coincidence
i was just heading that way myself
but seriously
let me give you a ride i insist
come on its the least i can do
after all youve done for me
i got a hot rat cooking
all right can i interest you
in a mudslide slug and tonic
a liquid libation
to ease that frustration
eyeballtini
well maybe just one
so the centaur says
thats not the half im talking about
i gotta say shrek i envy you
to live the life of an ogre
no worries no responsibilities
you are free to pillage
and terrorise as you please
free thats a laugh
oh yeah
sometimes i wish i had just one day
to feel like a real ogre again
why didnt you say so
magical transactions are my specialty
great next to mimes
magicians are my favourite people
hold on
king for a month
knight for a week
ogre for a day
think about it shrek
to be feared and hated
youll be like roar
and the villagers will be like get
away its shrek im so scared of him
it would be just like the good old days
when your swamp was your castle
when the world made sense
all right whats the catch
catch no theres no catch
no catchings really
i mean theres something
small thing nothing a little thing
all right i knew it
so what do you want
a day
a day
rats done
to make the magic work you gotta
give something to get something
in this case you gotta
give a day to get a day thats all
i cant just pick up
and leave my family
but thats the best part shrek
its a magical contract
no one will even know youre gone
and by the time this day is up
you are gonna feel like a changed ogre
still i dont know
hey no problem
forget it no big d doesnt matter
do you like white meat or dark meat
so what day would i have to give up
i dont know any day
a day from your past
a day you had the flu
a day you lost a pet
a day some meddling oaf
stuck his nose where it didnt belong
destroying your business
and ruining your life
just for an example
how about the day i met donkey
now theres a day
id like to take back
i dont know who that is
i know what about a day
you wouldnt even remember
like a day when you were a baby
an innocent mindless little baby
take any of those days you want
take them all for all i care
oh just one will do
ok good
a day from your childhood it is
i guess theres nothing wrong
with wanting a little time for myself
just 24 tiny little hours
im still my own ogre
yeah you is
i never needed to ask
for anyones permission before
so why start now
go on shrek
sign it
go on shrek
sign it shrek sign it
you signed it
so tell me what happens now

yeah you know we have
put away a lot of ogres

the ogre who got away is shrek
and if he shares a kiss
with fiona by sunrise
it is the end of the world our world
my empire

thats what they told me too
true love didnt get me
out of that tower
i did i saved myself
dont you get it
its all just a big fairy tale
fiona dont say that it does exist
how would you know
did you grow up locked away
in a dragons keep
did you live all alone
in a miserable tower
did you cry yourself
to sleep every night
waiting for a true love
that never came
but but im your true love
then where were you
when i needed you
maybe you kissed her wrong
no
the kiss didnt work
because fiona doesnt love me
dont despair fellow ogres
