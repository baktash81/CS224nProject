i think it would be wise for you
to see a doctor in kimanjay 
i took the liberty
of calling one for you 
  don t need one

if you can drive 
i think it s best that you leave today 
our visitor must be feeling better

he s walking so soon 
joe should ve dropped him harder 
he s not a poacher  jill 
the man works for animal conservancy
in california

yesterday by 
by a woman

you saved me  and i m grateful 
thank you  miss young 
i know who you are 
you re ruth young s daughter 
did she know about joe 
did she have a theory on him 
how did you keep him a secret
all these years 
by keeping people like you
off this mountain 
people like me 
i  i wanna help you 
you go back to where you came from
and tell them what you saw 
this place will be
crawling with people 
that s gonna happen anyway 
look  i m not the only one
who saw him 
an animal as rare as joe
means big money 
it s going to be tough trying to protect
him here  maybe impossible 
here is where he lives 
  he doesn t have a choice 
  that s not true 
the people i work for could take
care of joe  they have the facilities 
a cage 
that s just what joe needs 
no  no  not a cage  a preserve 
a place where he ll be free 
free from poachers  land developers 
  a place he ll be safe 
  but he won t be free 
how long do you think
he can stay free here 
the next people who come are gonna be
coming to hunt joe down 
quite an impressive facility
you have here  mr strasser 
  thank you 
  tell me  why is it   
that you keep such a low profile
about this wonderful place 
our only interest is the well being
of our animals 
well  i think i ve come
to the right place for morris 
i m sure you have 
he s grown out
of his habitat  and 
well  our zoo just doesn t have
the budget to do anything about it 
that s why he needs
a new home 
that s the telephone for you 
mr strasser  it s urgent 
will you excuse me 
mr anderson 
  sure 
  i ll be back 
garth  see what the market is   
for the organs of this lovely panda 
  ooh  big fella  we should get a lot 
  strasser 
it s about time 
do you know how long i ve been waiting 
what do you want  pindi 
not what i want  boss 
what you want 
how about a giant gorilla 
  talk 
  as big as three men 
  2 000 pounds at least 
  you ve been drinking  haven t you 
i swear to god  boss 
i saw him with my own two eyes 
he s  he s huge 
don t waste my time  pindi 
  hello  boss 
  2 000 pound gorilla 
he s crazy 
stupid girl

thought maybe you dropped it
and might want it back 
poaching s illegal 
get off this mountain 
jill 
jill  i need to talk to you 
jill 
  murderer 
  yeah 
your mother slept in this bed 
she worked at this desk 
she died in this jungle  do you plan
to do everything just like her 
my mother would have been proud
of what i did today 
proud 
of this foolishness out there 
proud of you risking your life 
she risked hers 
why shouldn t i risk mine 
i m just trying to keep a promise here 
i promised to take care of joe 
i will do everything it takes
to stop those poachers 
you cannot stop them 
even she could not stop them 
the other gorillas 
they have moved south to safer lands 
  joe stays behind 
  they won t accept him 
joe needs me 
the danger here is building
for both of you 
i feel it  and so do you 
i know what the american
is offering  jill 
consider it 
that s all i ask 
  leaving 
  yeah  i m heading up into the mountains 
see if i can throw some
of those dirtbags off joe s trail 
think it will work 
not for long 
i m just trying to buy you some time 
i suggest you get joe
as deep into the jungle as you can 
as fast as you can 
  okay 
  okay what 
okay  we ll go with you 
  we 
  me and joe 
we ll go with you to that place
of yours in california 
  you sure about this 
  no  i m absolutely not sure about this 
  but i ll do this on one condition 
  name it 
  i m in charge of joe 
  done 
  done 
  done 
  just like that 
  just 
  you re not very trusting  are you 
  no  i m not 
it must be tough for you then 
trying to measure me up 
  trying to decide if i m full
of it or    or just a fool 
i guess we ll just have to
figure it out as we go along 
look  what do you want me to say 
you ll be in charge of joe  okay 
come on 
we ll shake on it 
i don t shake 
that s not how
we make pacts around here 
all right  how do you
make pacts around here 
you have to endure a bite
from a makiki spider 
  a what 
  you ll have a high fever  hallucinations 
you ll say things  lots of things 
i ll hear what s in your heart 
then  if your intentions prove true 
then we have a pact 
  a spider bite and hallucinations 
  that s right 
then you ll trust me to take
you and joe to california with me 
absolutely 
well  what do you say 
i say that s the biggest load of crap
i ever heard in my whole life 
maybe you re not a fool after all 
get your things together fast

  yes  you are 
and i m in charge of this facility 
let s go  take it up 
okay  swing it up 
 and i m in charge of this facility   
i mean  who does he think he is 
i bet that man has never spent
one night outside in his entire life 
probably not  well  here are
your new  deluxe accommodations 
i should be out there with joe 
not here  not in this 
this cage 
look  i know how you feel 
it s not exactly my idea
of  home  sweet home  either 
but at least you re close to joe 
where s gregg 
talk to you later  i don t know 
he collected his paycheck 
he s probably in some jungle by now 
looking for giant sheep 
well  i think he should be here 
this is his discovery 
excuse me 
gregg s expertise is crashing humvees 
it s not explaining primate behaviour to
the chairman of the conservancy board 
you know what i think  harry 
i think you re jealous 
i m crippled with envy  yes 
just once i wanted to go into the field
and find a new species 
you know  anything 
a mollusc 
here we go 
  harry  dr banks 
  hi 
so  let s go see him 
see  the gorillas in the pangani
carry this recessive gene   
that pops up every four or five generations
with this rare form of gigantism 
and that s where
the legend comes from 
but i knew it was more
than a legend 
so i followed my gut instinct 
  i just had a hunch that this thing was true 
  pretty damn sharp  harry 
all right  here we are 
  pretty cool  huh 
  my  my  i should say so 
  where is he 
  um 
uh  joe 
come here  joe 
come here  boy 
gorillas  there s never one around
when you need  em 
  even for the chairman of the board 
  well  i came here to see him 
you know what  maybe 
you know what  i ll feed him 
  that ll get him to come out 
  um  harry 
don t worry 
i know what i m doing 
elliot  you stay here 
i m gonna go open the gate 
silver  brown  blond  white  there are
nine different colours to choose from 
ron  you have to ask
things like toxicity  this is safe 
this product has been tested
for ten years 
it s not just a coloured spray 
like some of you might be thinking 
it s just a plain  ordinary cosmetic 
and it just washes out in the evening 
  i was coming to get you 
  what s that noise 
security alarm in joe s habitat 
come on 
  joe  joe 
  what s happening 
  he s going crazy 
  open the gate 
open it  open it 
  hold it  don t shoot 
  no 
oh  god 
harry  it s okay 
  it doesn t feel okay 
  listen to me 
  just jump out from behind the trees 
  no 
no  i d rather not 
just jump out and say 
 you found me   
well  he knows he s found me 
that s the problem 
harry  do what she says 
you found me 
oh  god 
he s playing with him 
harry  he s playing with you 
  hide and seek 
  what 
shh  watch 
joe  where are you 
where could joe be 
  here he is 
  feeding time over  harry 
  very funny 
  good thing joe didn t want to play doctor 
look at you  all happy 
huh  joe 
that makes me so happy 
  harry 
  you know what  that never happened before 
  it was weird  wasn t it 
  put that girl in charge of the gorilla 
elliot  she has
no scientific training 
that ape is the best fund raising tool
this conservancy s ever had 
he s happy  i m happy 
so  you really think that
she s gonna be able to  you know 
  put her on the payroll  harry 
  okay 
  did you see that  did you see that 
  i saw  i saw 
  he was playing hide and seek with him 
  it s great 
you were right 
he likes it here 
oh  my god 
on his second day he s playing 
  he likes it here 
  mm mm mm mm 
  you ve got it bad 
  what are you talking about 
you know what i m talking about 
usually you are out the door
as soon as the animal s in his habitat 
you have a very active imagination 
i don t think so 
  oh  i think so 
  no  i don t think so 
i think mister world traveller has
goo goo eyes for the gorilla girl 
just close your eyes 
and then he s gonna do that 
and then you say   you found me  
come on 
behind me is the habitat
of what the experts are calling   
one of the world s most important
zoological finds of this century 
this is the home of what is believed
to be the world s largest primate 
a 2 000 pound gorilla named joe 
joe has been at the california animal
conservancy for a little over a month now 
he was brought here from africa
by dr gregory o hara 
  who told me that because of joe s remarkable size 
  my god  pindi was right 
he is a natural target for poachers 
  fortunately  the california animal conservancy programme   
  he s beautiful 
is rescuing animals
and bringing them here   
  so they can 
  the most beautiful animal i ever seen 
and the most valuable 
that s for sure 
it can t escape
because it s surrounded by a moat 
and there are also electrical wires
around the entire perimeter 
  isn t that the 
  wait  be quiet 
joe was raised from infancy by jill young 
the daughter of famed primatologist ruth young 
their closeness stems
from a tragic bond 
both joe and jill s mothers were killed by
poachers 12 years ago in the pangani forest 
  bloody hell  that s him 
  they both became orphans on the same night 
that s the little fella
who bit your finger off 
i m always amazed how 
if you wait long enough  the opportunity
for justice finally comes 
garth  book us two tickets
to america 
we are going to pay a visit
to this incredible animal 
i think i know how to convince
his current owners to part with him 
now  this fellow is
one of only 300 wild yaks   
remaining on the planet 
now  you may ask  why should we care
if this subspecies of yak survives 
  but if we don t protect 
  excuse me 
can we see joe 
yes  you can certainly
all see joe for the mere price of   
a diamond circle benefactor ticket
to tomorrow night s benefit 
but  you know 
this is for a good cause 
it s for the preservation
of an endangered species 
you remember  don t you 
  this is what you call
a good meal in a fine restaurant 
yeah 
it s my favourite restaurant
 cause they let you take off your shoes 
my granddad used to bring me
fishing down here when i was a kid 
wow  the pacific ocean 
that s nice  live music 
i hired him special 
ten minutes ago 
you wanna dance 
what 
so  this is a date  or something 
not that i d know 
i ve never been on one before 
yeah  well  i guess most guys
are afraid of a girl s father 
i can just see a guy telling joe
he s gonna get you home by midnight 
well  nobody s ever had to tell joe
what time they ll have me home by 
what s it like 
 it  
yeah  this whole dating 
dancing  love thing 
well  it s   
kind of like being bit
by a makiki spider 
and how s that 
  you get kind of a fever 
  fever 
ah  and then 
and then you 
you find yourself saying things 
lots of things 
what kind of things 
things like 
what is it 
i m sorry 
it s this thing 
we gotta go 
i don t understand
this animal 
  he s got everything he wants  why can t he just relax 
  harry  stop  oh 
he s ripping out saplings 
bam  bam  bam 
  taking out irrigation pipe 
  really  oh 
one big yank 
here comes the flood 
  what happened  what s wrong with him 
  we don t know  jill  do you 
is he okay 
  can you get in there and calm him down   
  joe 
before he relandscapes
the habitat 
joe  it s okay 
it s okay

  please 
i wouldn t be asking you
to postpone the benefit   
unless i thought there was
something really wrong with joe 
and i do 
from what i hear  you sang him to sleep
last night like a baby 
what s really wrong
about that 
mr baker  i swear to you 
joe is still not himself 
he s nervous and agitated 
and he shouldn t be exposed
to a crowd of strangers right now 
if you can just delay the party
just a few more 
  it s too late  jill 
  no 
  it s too soon 
  miss young  let me give you some advice 
stop worrying about joe 
and start worrying about what
you will wear to the party tonight 
cecily 
  oh  i m sorry 
  no  my fault 
  excuse me 
  yes 
it s just 
  what 
  you must be jill young 
yes 
and you look just like her 
  who 
  your mother 
  you knew my mother 
  yes 
i m an old friend
of your mother s 
i knew her when she was  uh 
only a little older than you 
  and you were just a tiny thing 
  oh 
  what an incredible woman she was 
  yeah 
i m sorry 
i m andre strasser 
i ve come here
to talk with your mr baker 
  actually  i m here for joe 
  joe 
and  in a way 
for your mother too 
i believe she would agree with me 
a magnificent wild animal
like joe needs more space 
like the raja preserve
i run in botswana 
raja preserve 
it s 20 000 acres there   
where the animals
are free to run 
here it s such a shame to see joe
living in a man made habitat   
and being used as
an attraction to raise money 
but i upset you 
  no 
  please 
i only mean to offer
an alternative 
anyway  here is my card 
i ll be attending
the event tonight 
maybe we can talk more
about this matter then 
i look forward to it 
yeah  bye

but   
i can t think who it is

  i don t know 
  i m elliot baker 
the world was once
a garden teeming with life 
a wondrous place to contemplate
creation in all its 
  so  you haven t forgotten me 
can i have your attention 
as you can hear  the secret   
  announced itself loud and clear 
  good 
have you forgotten this 
how much do you think he s worth 
couple of million 
after we sell him off 
piece by piece 
who knows how much we ll make 
ah  that got you going 
now be a good boy
and frighten the ladies 
can i have your attention 
our guest seems to be telling you   
  that i m talking too long 
  okay  let s go  we ve done our job here 
i d like to bring up to the podium
the director of our conservancy 
well  i suppose there s no need
to add to that introduction 
here s dr harry ruben 
thank you 
thank you very much 
in the time it took you
to drive here tonight 
three species have disappeared
from the earth 
extinct  never to be replaced 
we here at the conservancy
say this is a tragedy 
well  uh  obviously joe agrees 
  there s something wrong 
  but  um 
tonight  instead of focusing
on what we ve lost 
we d like to introduce you
to something that we ve found 
ladies and gentlemen  behind
this curtain is the newest member   
of the california animal conservancy 
we are very happy and proud
to introduce to you 
mighty joe 
joe 
it s okay 
come on  joe 
no  joe 
my god  what s wrong with him 
he s out of control 
i m going for the tranq gun 
no  gregg 
i ll stop him 
oh  my god 
move 
oh  god 
the gorilla
literally crashed the party 
officials here at the conservancy
are saying   
they don t know what caused
the animal s rampage 
more than a dozen people
were injured 
eight of them remain
hospitalized today 
in fact  three lawsuits
have been filed so far 
and word has it the city s attorney is
calling for the animal to be put to sleep 
standing with me is the conservancy
board s chairman  elliot baker 
exactly what is being done to assure
the public that joe won t attack again 
joe has been transferred to a special
steel reinforced concrete bunker 
but what about
when you let him out 
that won t be happening any time soon 
in fact  i want to make it clear
that we will be doing   
anything necessary to ensure
the safety of the public 
with the number of
lawsuits the conservancy is now facing 
will you shut down the facility
to the public 
joe 
i m right here  okay 
i knew there was
something wrong with him 
what do you think
happened out there 
joe would have never hurt
those people unprovoked 
something must ve got to him 
jill 
could i  um  talk to you for a second 
well  this wasn t
in the brochure  was it 
i promised you wouldn t be
put in a cage 
i m sorry  joe 
then the city attorney
talked to baker 
  i had nothing to do with this 
  with what 
joe s gonna have to stay in here until
they decide what they re gonna do with him 
  in here 
  yeah 
harry  look at him 
he s depressed 
he won t eat 
if he stays in here 
he ll die within days 
there is nothing we can do 
either you tell them you re getting
joe out of here  or i will 
this is way beyond
you and me 
joe freaked out on some
very influential people 
now he s a public relations nightmare 
no zoo will take
a 2 000 pound killer gorilla 
  he s not a killer 
  okay  okay 
but unless you can write a cheque
for millions of dollars   
and find him
a big backyard somewhere 
then joe s got nowhere to go 
i m sorry 
harry 
you re not gonna do anything 
i need your help 
  good evening 
  good evening 
  you can t go in there 
  it s okay  we re here to give joe more sedatives 
wha  i  uh 
unless you want him
to get frisky on your shift 
i suggest you let us get on with our job
so you can get on with yours 
come on  joe 
we re leaving 
yeah 
let s get you out of here 
what the hell are you doin  
the gorilla needs medication  and i ve
gotta take him over to the clinic for that 
  who says 
  doctor s orders  and i m the doctor 
yeah  well  uh 
i take my orders from mr baker 
so  uh  put him back
in his cage now 
easy  joe  easy 
officer  you don t want to point
that thing at him  believe me 
he didn t believe you 
okay  come on 
bring him out 
come on  big guy 
come on 
come on  joe 
into the truck 
that s it 
okay 
thanks 
i am gonna miss
those big ol  brown eyes 
you be good  joe 
goodbye  joe 
i was just starting to get
the hang of hide and seek 
i  uh  i think you should be

nobody notices joe s gone 
give you guys a chance
to make a run for it 
okay 
if you re ever in botswana and feel like taking
me out for a good meal at a fine restaurant

to let joe know what time you ll be
