your    your    your nose 
oh  oh  it does that sometimes 
  hey 
  hi 
i never enjoy anything 
i m always waiting
for whatever s next 
i think everyone s like that   
living life in fast forward 
never stopping to
enjoy the moment 
too busy trying to rush
through everything 
so we can get on with what we re really
supposed to be doing with our lives 
i get these flashes of
clarity  brilliant clarity 
where  for a second 
i stop and i think 
 wait  this is it 
 this is my life  i d better
slow down and enjoy it 
 because one day  we re all
going to end up in the ground 
 and that will be it 
we ll be gone 
so i think we should fuck 
um    what 
let s just fast forward through all
the drunken seduction bullshit   
we have to look forward to 
you don t look like you d
be very good at it anyway 
and i don t want to sit here and listen
to you bumblefuck your way through it 
we both want the same thing 
to go back to your room  have sex 
and never see each other again 
are you with me 
is this a trick 
the offer is about to expire 
no  no  i m in 
i m definitely in 
do you like that book 
no  god  no 
no  it s my idiot brother s
favorite book 
is it yours 
no  no 
it s my roommate s 
i m not really much of a reader 
good 
now come here 
yes  ma am 
as i stood there staring
through the window
into my ex  wife s new life 
i was overcome by the
oddest sensation 
watching her with this man was
like turning on a familiar sitcom
and realizing they had replaced one
of the lead actors with a stranger 
the show was the same  but the
thespian who played william borgens
for nearly twenty years was gone 
and in his place was a
younger  dumber model 
what was that  boy 
oh  shit 
down  heel  fucking dog 
rusty   
oh yeah 
there you go 
you got that bowl 
hey 
just rock it on there 
get him on there

there we go 
yeah 
dad  she s here 
ready 
hi  i m back 
dad   
smells good 
well  they said that you
have to go back there 
they just said that i think you
might have to end up paying for it 
no  but they re going to cancel
the whole thing  the appointment 
yeah  they re canceling it 
it s over  basically   
my book is being published 
oh  my god 
congratulations 
thank you  thanks  dad 
oh  my god 
we re so proud of you 
what house is it 
scribner 
what 
that s king s publisher 
yeah no  they re great 
great 
we got to have a toast  we have
to have a toast  scribner 
yeah  that s exactly what i was
thinking when i submitted the book 
this will really piss
rusty off 
it s not because they publish books
by hemingway or kurt vonnegut 
david mccullough  frank mccourt 
f  scott fitzgerald 
bob fucking dylan 
i didn t know you had
dibs on scribner 
i never said i had dibs  samantha 
i just was   
you re just jealous 
wow 
i m not jealous 
what an accomplishment 
your sister is having her first
book published  all right 
this is a cause for celebration 
this is what the holidays
are all about 
okay  cool 
you might want to congratulate her 
congratulations 
thank you 
geez  i didn t have my first
book published until   
i don t know 
i was 25 or 26 
i would have been happy
to call those guys 
i know them all over there 
i submitted it under a fake name
and didn t tell them whose
daughter i was
until after was accepted 
i wouldn t have minded 
i know  i just    because you
wanted it to be about your book
and not about being my daughter 
yeah  okay  well  this
is a toast    psst 
to you and your first novel 
just saying hi 
oh  it s not just saying hi 
did they make you
change the title 
no  they re not publishing
just saying hi 
it s a different book 
what 
i put that aside for now 
and i wrote a new one 
when 
over the summer 
what happened
to just saying hi 
you were excited about that 
i was excit    i put a lot of
work and effort into that 
i proofed the manuscript
and i   
i know 
i m sorry  i   
i    i    i thought my opinion
meant something 
it does  dad 
you know it does 
and yet you turn around and
write an entirely new book
and don t think
to share it with me 
i m sorry 
something s burning 
congratulations 
why would you let him set
that place at the table 
i set it 
he asked me to 
yeah  well  she s not coming 
i m about to head over there 
you should come 
give dad a chance to cool off 
i m not going over there 
fine 
suit yourself 
i ll tell her you said hi 
you can tell mom
to drop dead 
whoa   
this food is so good 
glad you like it 
so how did everything
go over at your dad s 
it was good  sam s getting
a book published 
what 
that was my reaction  too 
that s great 
i always thought your dad making you
and your sister keep journals was   
a little strange  but   
sounds like it s paying off 
  i can t believe it 
  why is it s strange 
rusty  just let that go 
no  why is it strange 
i just want to know why you
think it s so strange 
well  it just seems like
he was forcing you
to be writers   
instead of allowing
you to choose to be 
we don t have to keep the
journals if we don t want to 
you d have to get
a job if you stopped 
he pays us to do it so we
can focus on our writing
instead of working some
bullshit job at mcdonald s 
rusty   
what 
what 
are you stoned 
are you kidding 
are you being   
i m not stoned  rusty  i d like
to talk to you in the kitchen 
i think you re stoned 
great  good 
i m going 
what s gotten into you 
i m not going to let
that neanderthal   
talk about dad like that 
he didn t say anything
about your father 
it s not what he says 
it s how he talks about him like he s
some sort of weirdo or something 
and watching football doesn t
make you a neanderthal 
owning his own gym does 
okay enough 
enough 
is sam s book really getting published 
that s what she said 
wow 
it s been over a year
since we spoke 
i know 
she said to say hi to you 
i don t believe that
for a second  but   
it s very sweet of you to say 
aw  mom 
please don t ever hate
me the way she hates me 
i don t hate you at all  mom 
good  but you are stoned 
though  aren t you 
i thought it would make
it easier to eat again 
pot and nothing else 
ever  you understand me 
you don t have to worry
about me  mom 
yeah  i do 
it s my job 
i cleared the table
and started the dishes 
sorry i reacted the way i did 
i was just surprised 
i thought you were
happy with the book 
i was 
it just didn t seem like
my book anymore 
it felt like 
someone else s   
my editorial hand a little
heavy for you  yes  dad 
i was scared of how you d react 
and i felt guilty because of all the
work you put into just saying hi 
i m sorry   
stop apologizing 
it s my fault for involving myself in
your goddamn book in the first place 
i m guessing you don t
want to read the new one 
fuck no 
never 
no  thank you 
i brought you a hard copy 
really 
yeah 
i was going to sign it
for you if you wanted 
or not    but maybe 
leave it on my desk 
wait    can i ask you a question
without you getting defensive 
what 
rusty told me martin called the
cops on a prowler the other night 
dad  you ve got to stop doing this
to yourself  it s been two years 
she s coming back  you re
completely delusional 
and what s with setting
a place for her at the table 
that s fucking nuts  you
know they re fighting again 
and where did you see that 
through their window 
really  people get arrested
for doing things like that 
you re a well
respected novelist 
you ve won the pen
faulkner award twice 
you can t behave like that 
she s coming back 
jesus  at least tell me
you ve been writing 
look at what you ve let
her do to you  dad 
seriously 
hey  what are you working on 
it s a poem for english class 
sorry about earlier 
i was being a dick 
it s okay 
yeah  you were right 
i was just jealous 
i really am happy for you 
it s awesome 
you re going to have a book
published one day  too  you know 
sure  i know 
jason hooked me up
with some weed 
roof 
got your eye on any girls this year 
yeah  there s this girl   
kate  in my english class 
every time i see her 
i hear that song 
the beatles  song   i ve just seen a
face   playing in my head 
god  you are so pathetic 
at least i know i m pathetic 
let me give you some advice 
i can t wait to hear your advice 
it s so friggin  awesome 
there are two kinds
of people in this world 
hopeless romantics and realists 
right 
a realist just sees that face
and packs it in with every other
pretty girl they ve ever seen before 
the hopeless romantic
becomes convinced
that god put them on earth
to be with that one person 
but there is no god 
and life is only as meaningful as you
fool yourself into thinking it is 
guys who get laid
a lot are realists 
you should be listening 
just avoid love at all costs 
that s my motto 
you never been in love 
if love is setting a place at the table
for someone who is never coming home 
i think i ll pass 
that s fucking depressing  sam 
making students read their poetry
assignments in front of the class
is a sadistic exercise
in public humiliation 
you could have already been
done with it by now  rusty 
okay  okay  okay 
just  read it 
um  okay  this is a poem i
wrote over thanksgiving break 
uh    it s called school 
it was written under the
influence of cannabis 
okay  um    in the sea
of    this is so awkward 
uh   
 in the sea of desks  there s
talk of games and bags
 and long pipes that leak dreams
with the strike of a match 
 and there s a loudness
to the whispers i hear 
 whispers shouldn t be
that loud  should they 
 there s a girl over there
who everyone knows
 and men without ears who will
stand by the door for a price 
 in long hallways  there are
angry mobs of dwarves and rats
 and one single angel   
hey  rusty  hi 
hi  hi  i  um   
i liked your poem 
yeah 
yeah  it was really good 
thanks 
sure 
how was your thanksgiving 
oh  it was good 
it was a little weird 
my parents are divorced 
sol have two thanksgivings
in one thanksgiving 
it s just  like  strange 
how about you 
it was just boring  whatever 
that s cool 
yeah 
kate 
i have to go 
i just wanted to say i
liked your poem  so   
bye 
all right 
who the fuck is that 
just a guy from class 
fucking asshole 
hi 
i literally have 20 minutes 
so it will have to be quick 
come on 
let s go 
did you stretch 
come on 
just a second 
oh  yeah 
oh  make it rain 
yeah 
yeah 
to the left 
to the   
yeah 
yes 
all right  i got to run 
thursday  be ready 
yes  sarah 
hey 
hey 
goddamn it 
what are you doing 
you scared me 
i caught you 
you re reading my journal 
you promised you d never
read our journals 
sorry  i trusted you  dad 
i m sorry  that pisses
me off so much 
i m sorry  it s an
invasion of privacy 
rusty  i    i    i    sit down for
a second  let me explain 
no  i m not going
to sit down 
okay  okay  i wasn t
reading your journal 
i    i flipped it open to check
the dates like i always do
and something
jumped out at me
and and and grabbed me 
i m sorry  okay 
i m sorry 
what 
may i 
 i remember that it hurt 
 looking at her hurt   
that s it 
if that was the opening line of a book 
you d have your reader hooked 
they would have to keep reading 
i had to keep reading  sorry 
flattery is not going
to get you out of this 
no  no  that s coming
to an end right now 
you know flannery o connor 
i know flannery o connor 
she said nothing needed to happen in
a writer s life after they were 20 
by then  they had experienced
more than enough
to last their creative life  so 
so what s your point 
my point is   
sit down for a second  please 
rusty   
i don t think you re
experiencing enough 
i mean  the reason that you re comfortable
leaving your goddamn journal on my desk
is because there s nothing you re
trying to hide from me in your life 
and that really worries me  you know 
sweet  sensitive guys like you  they
spend their entire high school years
frozen in place while   
everybody is running around
going to parties
and getting laid  doing whatever 
i don t want you to look back
years from now
and think about this girl 
is it kate  yeah 
tell this girl how you feel 
put your heart on the line 
it s not that easy 
it is  too  it is  too 
look at your sister 
you can   
hey 
you can roll your eyes
all you want 
your sister is a great writer 
and it s because she s
courageous in her life 
she s promiscuous  dad 
it s not the same thing

of their experiences 
go get some 
it will be fun

was i the angel in the
poem you wrote 
yeah 
i think you re going
to be very good for me 
goodnight 
i love christmas 
you strike me as one
of those people 
i am  i m definitely
one of those people 
i love everything about it 
i love the lights 
the decorations 
how tbs plays a christmas
story 24 hours straight 
presents under the tree
and the looks on my kids
faces when they open them 
sitting by the fire with my
husband when they go to bed 
i get all depressed
during the holidays 
yeah  well  you re divorced  bill 
it s depressing 
hey  can i give you
a little bit of advice 
just from one fuck buddy
to another 
mm hmm 
you need to remarry 
hmm 
mm hmm 
you re not getting any younger 
and if i were you  i d be
on every dating website
signing up and just combing the
newspapers for personal ads 
i haven t been on a
date in 25 years 
yeah  but what is that 
listen  you re handsome 
you re successful 
you have a mild amount of celebrity 
which is really all a
writer can ask for 
that s enough to land
one of those
20 something trophy wives 
you ve really thought
about this  huh 
well  i care about you  bill 
i know you love erica 
but she married someone else 
and you have to start
thinking about your future
and whether or not you want
that to be a happy one 
because i don t want
to jog by in five years
and find you waiting on
that lawn chair for me 
it s a very comfortable lawn chair 
is it 
just think about it 
procreation  you give to the
next one down the line 
that s really all we ve got 
society  government 
money  religion 
careers  nuclear families 
monogamy 
these are all just highly creative
socially accepted delusions
that we impose on reality to try and gain
some semblance of control over our lives 
it gives us the illusion of choice 
it makes us feel a little
less like animals 
animals  what do you mean 
like evolution 
yeah  evolution  exactly 
i do not believe
in evolution 
there s 400 billion stars
in the milky way alone 
making the amount of stars
in the entire universe
completely mind boggling 
we are nothing 
if an asteroid hadn t hit earth
65 million years ago
and wiped out all the dinosaurs 
we wouldn t be here 
yeah 
i m going to go 
good  all you creationists do is
blow chances at getting laid 
really 
ooh  that was awkward 
you ve really got
to stop stalking me 
i can t even go anywhere without
you showing up to annoy me 
were you hitting on that guy 
it s none of your business 
i think he s a mormon 
well  what the hell
is he doing here 
trying to find other mormon girls 
i m sure you corrupted him 
ruined his relationship with god 
you want to get out of here 
do you have brain damage 
no  i think i made it pretty clear
that i have absolutely no
interest in going out with you 
no  no  no  you and i
are going to be friends 
but i don t want to be
friends with you 
oh  you don t want to be 
well  i m going
to take your jacket
and you can follow me  we can
get some coffee if you d like 
i need that   
jacket 
what are some of your
favorite books 
is that really the angle
you re going to play 
really  i thought you d be
more creative than this 
well  come on  we re writers  right 
yeah 
books matter to us  i mean 
come on here  please 
fine  what are some
of your favorite books 
no  you can t do that 
i asked you 
because you want to know
something personal about me 
if i tell you what
my favorite books are 
you ll say titles that will convince
me that we re soulmates 
or you ll latch onto one
of my favorites
and try to convince me it s
one of your favorites  too 
god  you re so tough 
it s why you re obsessed with me 
i m not obsessed with you 
i m like a unicorn to you 
you ll do or say anything
to possess me 
i m not like that and
you re not like a unicorn 
okay  well  then books 
but please  at least
attempt to be interesting 
no catcher in the rye or
portnoy s complaint  okay 
well  i write mysteries  so   
i love elmore leonard 
james lee burke 
ed brubaker 
who s ed brubaker 
he writes an incredible  hard boiled
crime comic called criminal 
telling me that you
read comic books
isn t exactly sweeping
me off my feet 
what s your favorite book 
just say the first thing
that pops into your head

shut up and read to me 
okay 
 dalie hallie couldn t tell
if she felt huge or small 
 she wondered whether
her head
 were so big as to be able to
contain all this starry universe   
 or if the universe were so
little that it would fit
 within the compass
of her human head   
lou 
do you see that angel by the door
or am i the only one seeing her 
oh  that    that s definitely
not an angel  mom 
hi 
hi 
hi  what are you doing here 
oh  same thing
you re doing  i hope 
don t be suspicious 
i m getting a laptop for samantha 
in fact  i got to pick out a color 
why don t you come 
i don t know 
excuse me 
huh

i don t know if it s
a good idea  bill

i d love to 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah  i love to 
i m glad i bumped into you 
i m sure that s
what all stalkers say 
no  really 
i ve been thinking a lot
about what you said 
really 
mm hmm 
somebody else said
the same thing recently 
someone else asked you to stop
hanging around their house at night 
about moving on with my life 
who was that 
tricia wolcott 
lives about a mile and
a half down the beach 
yeah  i remember her 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i always suspected
you had a crush on her 
yeah  she s very pretty 
she s very married  as i recall 
you re seeing her 
i think i m a good way
for her to kill an hour
after she drops her
kids off at school 
an hour 
an hour 
so she thinks you need to
stop moping around  too  huh 
something like that 
here s a confession 
i m not a great writer 
i m a great re writer 
i think about us 
our story and   
and all the things that
went wrong with us
and i    i could do it so
much better this time 
i haven t written anything
since you left 
bill   
you ve had two books published 
well  they were books that i
started when we were married 
i finished them  but i haven t
written anything new 
you are a great writer 
don t waste all your
imagination on me 
which way are you   
i m over here 
i m the other way 
it was great running into you 
you  too 
bill   
i have    i have days when i m not
sure if i made the right decision 
i have bad days  too 
i don t know why i m saying this 
i guess i just don t want you to
think that i don t think about us 
you know  and   
all those years
we spent together 
because i do   
think about   
everything that i gave up 
i wonder if it was worth it 
was it 
i got to go 
merry christmas

one of the most satisfying reading
experiences of your life

the characters are vibrant and alive 
but 
i mean  i knew you were cynical 
but is that really how you
feel about love and marriage 
i don t know 
sometimes 
oh  thank you 
how much of that
really happened 
i made most of it up 
i didn t draw that much
from my parents  divorce 
other than the little
girl seeing her mother
having sex with the
man on the beach 
holy shit  that really happened 
yeah 
i mean  i wasn t a little girl 
i was in high school 
my parents were having a party 
and i was up on the roof 
it was late  and my mom
came staggering out of the
back of the house with martin 
and she was all over him 
and i remember martin saying 
 what about bill 
what if bill sees  
and my mom replying 
 i don t care

hey  sis  congratulations 
thank you so much for coming

sam tells me you re a

i m like the biggest stephen

i love the sand 
it s my favorite one 
what 
since when 
what do you mean 
who doesn t like stephen king 
she doesn t like stephen king 
i don t not   
let s leave them 
let s get    she calls
herself a novelist 
you guys continue this 
we re going to go 
girls 
yeah 
two champagnes  please 
how old is she 
21 
i wouldn t believe you
if you told me she was 18
much less 21 
how old are you 
this is my party 
stop acting like a pussy 
nobody s going to tell on you 
and i haven t even told you about
the big tip i m going to leave you 
as far as i know  you ordered
these drinks for yourself 
i didn t even see her here 
and here s the drinks
you ordered  miss  enjoy 
i will   
thank you 
samantha 
oh  sorry   
don t worry about it  it s your night 
go have fun 
ladies and gentlemen  could i
have your kind attention  please 
you may come forward if you wish 
i have been trying to get william borgens
up here to speak to my class for years 
he s never said no  but he s
never said yes  either 
tonight  i have him at a
certain disadvantage 
my entire class is here  bill 
and i insist you come up
here and say a few words 
ladies and gentlemen 
mr  borgens 
your professor  while a very nice
man  is a sneaky son of a bitch 
the reason leslie could never get me up
here to talk about the process of writing
is i m not sure i have much to say
about it that could benefit you 
i still find it all very mysterious 
years after i wrote my first book 
and i m not sure what it
is that compels a person
to continue to play make believe
even after they re an adult 
my favorite book is a collection
of short stories by raymond carver
called what we talk about
when we talk about love 
and in the closing lines of the
title story  carver says   
 i could hear
my heart beating 
 i could hear everyone s heart 
 i could hear the human
noise we sat there making 
 not one of us moved 
 not even when
the room went dark   
and i think that
that s what writing is 
it s listening for that beating heart 
and when we hear it 
it s our job to decipher it
to the best of our abilities 
i m here because my daughter
samantha s book is being published
in case you haven t heard 
this is her success 
i love you  dad 
i love you  too 
this seat taken 
louis invited me 
well  that was a calculated risk 
how long you been here 
mm  i was waiting in my
car for about an hour
trying to build up
the courage to come in 
so that s what 19 looks like 
she s all grown up now 
no 
she s still just a baby 
you going to talk to her 
i don t know 
i m scared 
yeah  she s scary 
she s all i ve done with my life 
and she doesn t want me 
hey   
you want some courage 
free of charge 
yes  please

john cheever s
the world of apples

um  well  i really liked it

sometimes 
i m sorry 
anyway  she swiped it
from my library 
she did 
yeah 
it could only have been her 
she thought that it
was your favorite book 
that s what i had told her  and   
i think she was hoping to
find some piece of you in it 
go talk to your daughter 
yeah 
hi

oh  p  s  you were
right about that book 
i cried a  the end 
big time 
i know it s been a
rough couple months   
but you coming home drunk   
or stoned   
every night 
now you ve been in a fight 
it was payback for something that
happened last fall  i don t care 
i know it s your first heartbreak 
i know it hurts 
nothing hurts like the first one 
but you ve got to channel
this into your work 
make something
positive out of it 
is that what you did
when mom left 
what 
is that what you did when mom left 
you turned it   
you re grounded 
you kidding me  dad 
would you just chill out  you can t
round me  yeah  i just did  okay 
i just did 
you re the one who told me   
no journal  nothing 
you re the one who told me to
go out and get experiences 
you can t make me write  dad 
i don t have to  you re a writer 
you ll do it yourself 
when you were little 
you used to run down
to the edge of the water like that
when the tide was pulling out 
and you would turn around
screaming when it came   
i m letting the ocean
get me  daddy 
i m letting the ocean get me 
your mom used to watch
you like a hawk 
she was terrified that the
ocean was going to grab you
and pull you out to sea 
why are we talking about her 
what are we doing down here 
your mom loves you 
she never did anything to you 
it s pointless  i know
what you re going to say 
no  you don t 
those things she did to me 
the things you ve been
holding over her 
i had already done
to her years ago 
what are you talking about 
i fell in love with somebody 
and and got lost  left 
bullshit  you were just a baby 
and your mother waited for me 
shut up  dad 
she waited six months  samantha 
and when i realized what a selfish
shit i d been    shut up  dad 
she took me back 
it s the truth 
you couldn t tell me  dad 
really 
you just made me hate her 
she made me promise that if she
did something as stupid as i had
she hoped i d have the
decency to wait for her 
so i am 
i should have told you  samantha 
i m sorry 
i m sorry 
she waited six months  dad 
you ve been waiting three years 
i think you made good
on your promise 
it s okay to stop waiting 
yeah   
she s coming back 
what makes you so sure 
because she waited 
and your mother is a far better
person than i ll ever be
