your your your nose
oh oh it does that sometimes
hey

i never enjoy anything
im always waiting
for whatevers next
i think everyones like that
living life in fast forward
never stopping to
enjoy the moment
too busy trying to rush
through everything
so we can get on with what were really
supposed to be doing with our lives
i get these flashes of
clarity brilliant clarity
where for a second
i stop and i think
wait this is it
this is my life id better
slow down and enjoy it
because one day were all
going to end up in the ground
and that will be it
well be gone

the drunken seduction bullshit
we have to look forward to

now come here
yes maam
as i stood there staring
through the window
into my ex wifes new life
i was overcome by the
oddest sensation
watching her with this man was
like turning on a familiar sitcom
and realizing they had replaced one
of the lead actors with a stranger
the show was the same but the
thespian who played william borgens
for nearly twenty years was gone
and in his place was a
younger dumber model
what was that boy
oh shit
down heel fucking dog
rusty
oh yeah

you got that bowl
hey
just rock it on there

thats kings publisher
yeahno theyre great
great
we got to have a toast we have
to have a toast scribner
yeah thats exactly what i was
thinking when i submitted the book
this will really piss
rusty off
its not because they publish books
by hemingway or kurt vonnegut
david mccullough frank mccourt
f scott fitzgerald
bob fucking dylan
i didnt know you had
dibs on scribner
i never said i had dibs samantha
i just was
youre just jealous
wow
im not jealous
what an accomplishment
your sister is having her first
book published all right
this is a cause for celebration
this is what the holidays
are all about
okay cool
you might want to congratulate her
congratulations
thank you
geez i didnt have my first
book published until
i dont know
i was 25 or 26
i would have been happy
to call those guys
i know them all over there
i submitted it under a fake name
and didnt tell them whose
daughter i was
until after was accepted
i wouldnt have minded
i know i just because you
wanted it to be about your book
and not about being my daughter
yeah okay well this
is a toast psst
to you and your first novel
just saying hi
oh its not just saying hi
did they make you
change the title
no theyre not publishing
just saying hi
its a different book
what
i put that aside for now
and i wrote a new one
when
over the summer
what happened
to just saying hi
you were excited about that
i was excit i put a lot of
work and effort into that
i proofed the manuscript
and i
i know
im sorry i
i i i thought my opinion
meant something
it does dad
you know it does
and yet you turn around and
write an entirely new book
and dont think
to share it with me
im sorry
somethings burning
congratulations
why would you let him set
that place at the table
i set it
he asked me to
yeah well shes not coming
im about to head over there
you should come
give dad a chance to cool off
im not going over there
fine
suit yourself
ill tell her you said hi
you can tell mom
to drop dead
whoa
this food is so good
glad you like it
so how did everything
go over at your dads
it was good sams getting
a book published
what
that was my reaction too
thats great
i always thought your dad making you
and your sister keep journals was
a little strange but
sounds like its paying off
i cant believe it
why is its strange
rusty just let that go
no why is it strange
i just want to know why you
think its so strange
well it just seems like
he was forcing you
to be writers
instead of allowing
you to choose to be
we dont have to keep the
journals if we dont want to
youd have to get
a job if you stopped
he pays us to do it so we
can focus on our writing
instead of working some
bullshit job at mcdonalds
rusty
what
what
are you stoned
are you kidding
are you being
im not stoned rusty id like
to talk to you in the kitchen
i think youre stoned
great good
im going
whats gotten into you
im not going to let
that neanderthal
talk about dad like that
he didnt say anything
about your father
its not what he says
its how he talks about him like hes
some sort of weirdo or something
and watching football doesnt
make you a neanderthal
owning his own gym does
okayenough
enough
is sams book really getting published
thats what she said
wow
its been over a year
since we spoke
i know
she said to say hi to you
i dont believe that
for a second but
its very sweet of you to say
aw mom
please dont ever hate
me the way she hates me
i dont hate you at all mom
good but you are stoned
though arent you
i thought it would make
it easier to eat again
pot and nothing else
ever you understand me
you dont have to worry
about me mom
yeah i do
its my job
i cleared the table
and started the dishes
sorry i reacted the way i did
i was just surprised
i thought you were
happy with the book
i was
it just didnt seem like
my book anymore
it felt like
someone elses
my editorial hand a little
heavy for you yes dad
i was scared of how youd react
and i felt guilty because of all the
work you put into just saying hi
im sorry
stop apologizing
its my fault for involving myself in
your goddamn book in the first place
im guessing you dont
want to read the new one
fuck no
never
no thank you
i brought you a hard copy
really
yeah
i was going to sign it
for you if you wanted
or not but maybe
leave it on my desk
wait can i ask you a question
without you getting defensive
what
rusty told me martin called the
cops on a prowler the other night
dad youve got to stop doing this
to yourself its been two years
shes coming back youre
completely delusional
and whats with setting
a place for her at the table
thats fucking nuts you
know theyre fighting again
and where did you see that
through their window
really people get arrested
for doing things like that
youre a well
respected novelist
youve won the pen
faulkner award twice
you cant behave like that
shes coming back
jesus at least tell me
youve been writing
look at what youve let
her do to you dad
seriously
hey what are you working on
its a poem for english class
sorry about earlier
i was being a dick
its okay
yeah you were right
i was just jealous
i really am happy for you
its awesome
youre going to have a book
published one day too you know
sure i know
jason hooked me up
with some weed
roof
got your eye on any girls this year
yeah theres this girl
kate in my english class
every time i see her
i hear that song
the beatles song ive just seen a
face playing in my head
god you are so pathetic
at least i know im pathetic
let me give you some advice
i cant wait to hear your advice
its so friggin awesome
there are two kinds
of people in this world
hopeless romantics and realists
right
a realist just sees that face
and packs it in with every other
pretty girl theyve ever seen before
the hopeless romantic
becomes convinced
that god put them on earth
to be with that one person
but there is no god
and life is only as meaningful as you
fool yourself into thinking it is
guys who get laid
a lot are realists
you should be listening
just avoid love at all costs
thats my motto
you never been in love
if love is setting a place at the table
for someone who is never coming home
i think ill pass
thats fucking depressing sam
making students read their poetry
assignments in front of the class
is a sadistic exercise
in public humiliation
you could have already been
done with it by now rusty
okay okay okay
just read it
um okay this is a poem i
wrote over thanksgiving break
uh its called school
it was written under the
influence of cannabis
okay um in the sea
of this is so awkward
uh
in the sea of desks theres
talk of games and bags
and long pipes that leak dreams
with the strike of a match
and theres a loudness
to the whispers i hear
whispers shouldnt be
that loud should they
theres a girl over there
who everyone knows
and men without ears who will
stand by the door for a price
in long hallways there are
angry mobs of dwarves and rats
and one single angel
hey rusty hi
hi hi i um
i liked your poem
yeah
yeah it was really good
thanks
sure
how was your thanksgiving
oh it was good
it was a little weird
my parents are divorced
sol have two thanksgivings
in one thanksgiving
its just like strange
how about you
it was just boring whatever
thats cool
yeah
kate
i have to go
i just wanted to say i
liked your poem so
bye
all right
who the fuck is that
just a guy from class
fucking asshole
hi
i literally have 20 minutes
so it will have to be quick
come on
lets go
did you stretch
come on
just a second
oh yeah
oh make it rain
yeah
yeah
to the left
to the
yeah
yes
all right i got to run
thursday be ready
yes sarah
hey
hey
goddamn it
what are you doing
you scared me
i caught you
youre reading my journal
you promised youd never
read our journals
sorry i trusted you dad
im sorry that pisses
me off so much
im sorry its an
invasion of privacy
rusty i i i sit down for
a second let me explain
no im not going
to sit down
okay okay i wasnt
reading your journal
i i flipped it open to check
the dates like i always do
and something
jumped out at me
andandand grabbed me
im sorry okay
im sorry
what
may i
i remember that it hurt
looking at her hurt
thats it
if that was the opening line of a book
youd have your reader hooked
they would have to keep reading
i had to keep reading sorry
flattery is not going
to get you out of this
no no thats coming
to an end right now
you know flannery oconnor
i know flannery oconnor
she said nothing needed to happen in
a writers life after they were 20
by then they had experienced
more than enough
to last their creative life so
so whats your point
my point is
sit down for a second please
rusty
i dont think youre
experiencing enough
i mean the reason that youre comfortable
leaving your goddamn journal on my desk
is because theres nothing youre
trying to hide from me in your life
and that really worries me you know
sweet sensitive guys like you they
spend their entire high school years
frozen in place while
everybody is running around
going to parties
and getting laid doing whatever
i dont want you to look back
years from now
and think about this girl
is it kate yeah
tell this girl how you feel
put your heart on the line
its not that easy
it is too it is too
look at your sister
you can
hey
you can roll your eyes
all you want
your sister is a great writer
and its because shes
courageous in her life
shes promiscuous dad

of their experiences

goodnight
i love christmas
you strike me as one
of those people
i am im definitely
one of those people
i love everything about it
i love the lights
the decorations
how tbs plays a christmas
story 24 hours straight
presents under the tree
and the looks on my kids
faces when they open them
sitting by the fire with my
husband when they go to bed
i get all depressed
during the holidays
yeah well youre divorced bill
its depressing
hey can i give you
a little bit of advice
just from one fuck buddy
to another
mmhmm
you need to remarry
hmm
mmhmm
youre not getting any younger
and if i were you id be
on every dating website
signing up and just combing the
newspapers for personal ads
i havent been on a
date in 25 years
yeah but what is that
listen youre handsome
youre successful
you have a mild amount of celebrity
which is really all a
writer can ask for
thats enough to land
one of those
20something trophy wives
youve really thought
about this huh
well i care about you bill
i know you love erica
but she married someone else
and you have to start
thinking about your future
and whether or not you want
that to be a happy one
because i dont want
to jog by in five years
and find you waiting on
that lawn chair for me
its a very comfortable lawn chair
is it
just think about it
procreation you give to the
next one down the line
thats really all weve got
society government
money religion
careers nuclear families
monogamy
these are all just highly creative
socially accepted delusions
that we impose on reality to try and gain
some semblance of control over our lives
it gives us the illusion of choice
it makes us feel a little
less like animals
animals what do you mean
like evolution
yeah evolution exactly
i do not believe
in evolution
theres 400 billion stars
in the milky way alone
making the amount of stars
in the entire universe
completely mindboggling
we are nothing
if an asteroid hadnt hit earth
65 million years ago
and wiped out all the dinosaurs
we wouldnt be here
yeah
im going to go
good all you creationists do is
blow chances at getting laid
really
ooh that was awkward
youve really got
to stop stalking me
i cant even go anywhere without
you showing up to annoy me
were you hitting on that guy
its none of your business
i think hes a mormon
well what the hell
is he doing here
trying to find other mormon girls
im sure you corrupted him
ruined his relationship with god
you want to get out of here
do you have brain damage
no i think i made it pretty clear
that i have absolutely no
interest in going out with you
no no no you and i
are going to be friends
but i dont want to be
friends with you
oh you dont want to be
well im going
to take your jacket
and you can follow me we can
get some coffee if youd like
i need that
jacket
what are some of your
favorite books
is that really the angle
youre going to play
really i thought youd be
more creative than this
well come on were writers right
yeah
books matter to us i mean
come on here please
fine what are some
of your favorite books
no you cant do that
i asked you
because you want to know
something personal about me
if i tell you what
my favorite books are
youll say titles that will convince
me that were soulmates
or youll latch onto one
of my favorites
and try to convince me its
one of your favorites too
god youre so tough
its why youre obsessed with me
im not obsessed with you
im like a unicorn to you
youll do or say anything
to possess me
im not like that and
youre not like a unicorn
okay well then books
but please at least
attempt to be interesting
no catcher in the rye or
portnoys complaint okay
well i write mysteries so
i love elmore leonard
james lee burke
ed brubaker
whos ed brubaker
he writes an incredible hardboiled
crime comic called criminal
telling me that you
read comic books
isnt exactly sweeping
me off my feet
whats your favorite book
just say the first thing
that pops into your head
dear mr henshaw by beverly cleary

dalie hallie couldnt tell
if she felt huge or small

were so big as to be able to
contain all this starry universe
or if the universe were so
little that it would fit
within the compass
of her human head
lou
do you see that angel by the door
or am i the only one seeing her

a half down the beach
yeah i remember her
yeah
yeah
yeah
i always suspected
you had a crush on her
yeah shes very pretty
shes very married as i recall
youre seeing her
i think im a good way
for her to kill an hour
after she drops her
kids off at school
an hour
an hour
so she thinks you need to
stop moping around too huh
something like that
heres a confession
im not a great writer
im a great rewriter
i think about us
our story and
and all the things that
went wrong with us
and i i could do it so
much better this time
i havent written anything
since you left

youve had two books published
well they were books that i
started when we were married
i finished them but i havent
written anything new
you are a great writer

it was great running into you
you too
bill
i have i have days when im not
sure if i made the right decision
i have bad days too
i dont know why im saying this
i guess i just dont want you to
think that i dont think about us
you know and
all those years
we spent together

much less 21
how old are you
this is my party

nobodys going to tell on you

thank you
samantha
oh sorry
dont worry about it its your night
go have fun
ladies and gentlemen could i
have your kind attention please
you may come forward if you wish
i have been trying to get william borgens
up here to speak to my class for years
hes never said no but hes
never said yes either
tonight i have him at a
certain disadvantage
my entire class is here bill
and i insist you come up
here and say a few words
ladies and gentlemen
mr borgens
your professor while a very nice
man is a sneaky son of a bitch
the reason leslie could never get me up
here to talk about the process of writing
is im not sure i have much to say
about it that could benefit you
i still find it all very mysterious
years after i wrote my first book
and im not sure what it
is that compels a person
to continue to play make believe
even after theyre an adult
my favorite book is a collection
of short stories by raymond carver
called what we talk about
when we talk about love
and in the closing lines of the
title story carver says
i could hear
my heart beating
i could hear everyones heart
i could hear the human
noise we sat there making
not one of us moved
not even when
the room went dark
and i think that
thats what writing is
its listening for that beating heart
and when we hear it
its our job to decipher it
to the best of our abilities
im here because my daughter
samanthas book is being published
in case you havent heard
this is her success
i love you dad
i love you too
this seat taken
louis invited me
well that was a calculated risk

the courage to come in

it was payback for something that
happened last fall i dont care
i know its your first heartbreak
i know it hurts
nothing hurts like the first one
but youve got to channel
this into your work
make something
positive out of it
is that what you did
when mom left
what
is that what you did when mom left
you turned it
youre grounded
you kidding me dad
would you just chill out you cant
round me yeah i just did okay
i just did
youre the one who told me
no journal nothing
youre the one who told me to
go out and get experiences
you cant make me write dad
i dont have to youre a writer
youll do it yourself
when you were little
you used to run down
to the edge of the water like that
when the tide was pulling out
and you would turn around
screaming when it came
im letting the ocean
get me daddy
im letting the ocean get me
your mom used to watch
you like a hawk
she was terrified that the
ocean was going to grab you
and pull you out to sea
why are we talking about her
what are we doing down here
your mom loves you
she never did anything to you
its pointless i know
what youre going to say
no you dont
those things she did to me
the things youve been
holding over her
i had already done
to her years ago
what are you talking about
i fell in love with somebody
and and got lost left
bullshit you were just a baby
and your mother waited for me
shut up dad
she waited six months samantha
and when i realized what a selfish
shit id been shut up dad
she took me back
its the truth
you couldnt tell me dad
really
you just made me hate her
she made me promise that if she
did something as stupid as i had
she hoped id have the
decency to wait for her
so i am
i should have told you samantha
im sorry
im sorry
she waited six months dad
youve been waiting three years
i think you made good
on your promise
its okay to stop waiting
