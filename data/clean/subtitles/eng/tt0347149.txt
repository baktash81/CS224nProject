look out for yourself
sorry  the shop s closed
i thought i d locked the door
what a cheap shop 
full of cheap little hats
and you re quite cheap looking yourself
this is just a simple hat shop
i think you had better leave
you re very brave  taking on
the witch of the waste
the witch of the waste 
you won t be able to tell anyone
about that spell
my regards to howl
is this really me 
i ve got to stay calm
i ve got to calm down
it s no use panicking  sophie
i ll be fine  i ll be fine

welcome home  ma am 
  welcome home
  how do you like it 
it s all the rage in kingsbury
amazing
it suits you
don t you think it s wonderful 
sophie 
mrs  hatter  sophie hasn t come down
to work yet
i wonder what s the matter 
sophie 
don t come in
i ve got an awful cold
i don t want you to catch it
you sound just awful   
like some 90 year old woman
i ll stay in bed today
you sure  all right  then
here we go   
you ll be fine  old lady
you re still healthy  and these clothes
finally suit you
but i can t stay here
ouch  ouch
lt s not easy being old
they re saying this war
is going to be terrible   
like a hand  granny 
such a gentleman 
but i ll manage
sure  old lady 
but where are you off to 
just a bit farther than where
you re going
i don t recommend it  granny
nothing but witches and wizards ahead
thank you
going to the folding valley 
at this hour 
says her youngest sister s there
i ve hardly made any progress at all
thank goodness i ve still got my teeth
that ll make a good cane
up we go
might be a bit too thick
ouch  ouch
what a stubborn branch
never underestimate
grandma sophie
heave
a scarecrow  eh  i thought you were
working for the witch
but how do you stand by yourself 
your head s a turnip
i ve always hated turnips
at least you re not
upside down anymore
so long
lt s so cold
the town s still so close
don t follow me
you don t owe me a thing
you must be a magical whatever you are
i ve had enough of witches and spells 
just go stand wherever you like 
this is a perfect cane
thank you kindly
while you re at it  could you bring me
a house to sleep in 
seems you get more cunning with age
what a huge battleship
i never realized how weak you feel
when you get old
i smell smoke
maybe there s a cabin
turnip head  isn t that howl s castle 
this is hardly what i meant
when i asked for shelter 
what is this 
you call this a castle 
is that the way in 
just wait up there
hey  there 
are you going to let me on  or not 
my shawl 
it seems warm enough inside  turnip
i m going in
thank you
even howl wouldn t want
an ancient heart like mine
this time  it s really goodbye
you may be a turnip 
but you re a good turnip
may you find happiness
what is this place 
just looks like a dilapidated heap
well  one nice thing about getting old
is that nothing surprises you anymore
that s some spell you re under
it won t be easy to break
the fire talked
and you can t even
tell anyone about it
you re howl 
wrong  i m the fire demon  calcifer 
well  then  calcifer  can you break
the spell i m under 
easy
if you break the spell that chains me
to this place 
i ll break your spell in a flash
in other words  bargain with a demon
you sure you can keep that promise 
demons don t make promises
i suggest you look elsewhere
but i m an exploited demon
i m chained here by a contract with howl 
who works me to death
i m the one who keeps
this castle moving
my  you ve got it rough
if you figure out the secret contract 
the spell will break
if you do that 
i ll break your spell  too
all right
a bargain  eh 
granny
granny
boy   
i ve got my doubts about her
hey  who s this 
porthaven 
when did she get in 
stand by
why  mayor  sir
the sun is already high
is master jenkins at home 
the master is out
i answer in his stead
an invitation from his majesty
it has come to war
his majesty desires every wizard
and magician  even the witches 
to aid our homeland
his presence is imperative
that is all
war  how awful
and who might you be 
calcifer let me in
don t look at me
she wandered in from the wastes
the wastes 
that s strange
you re not a witch  are you 
a witch could never get in
porthaven  again
a customer 
stand by
state your purpose
mama sent me
the usual spell 
behave yourself  now
it s not the wastes
granny  are you a witch  too 
that s right 
i m the scariest witch in the land
sprinkle this powder on your ship
and the winds will favor it
sure
many thanks
i can t have you making up things
you should give up that disguise
lt s not a disguise  it s magic
the kingsbury door
stand by
is this the residence of
wizard pendragon 
it is  indeed
i bear an invitation
from his majesty
please inform master pendragon
that he is required at the palace
our thanks to you
a city fit for a king
get back in or you ll lose your nose
stop wandering around
that s enough 
i m going to get really mad
this is a magic house  isn t it 
oh  boy 
where does the black one lead 
only master howl knows
i m having my breakfast
but you ve got bacon and eggs
we can t use the fire
when master howl s away
i ll cook for you
but you can t
calcifer only obeys master howl
that s right  i won t cook for you
oh  here s my hat
all right  calcifer
be a good fire  now
forget it  i m a demon
i answer to no one
you ll do as i say 
or i ll pour water on you
or would you rather i told howl
about our bargain 
hey  hey 
i never should ve let this old lady in
so  what ll it be 
that s right  there s a good fire
hey  hey 
i ll burn the bacon
calcifer s doing what she says
i d like some tea  too
have you got a kettle 
sure
welcome home  master howl
you have letters from the king
to jenkins and to pendragon
calcifer  you re so obedient
she bullied me
not an easy thing to do
who exactly are you 
i m grandma sophie
you see  i m your
new cleaning lady
give me that
pass me two more bacon slices
and six more eggs
yummy
yummy
and who hired you to clean 
why  i hired myself
i ve never seen such a filthy house
hmm
markl  plates
you re all ganging up on me
please join us  sophie
sit over here
pick one
everything else is dirty
i ve got my work cut out for me
markl
yes
sophie
thank you
brethren  let us partake
of our daily bread
our daily bread
haven t had a real breakfast
in a long while
so many manners to teach   
so  what s that in your pocket 
what 
i wonder what it is
let me
it s scorched into the table
master howl  this is   
ancient sorcery
and powerful  too
the witch of the waste 
 he who catches a falling star 
oh heartless man 
 your heart shall be mine    
well  so much for the table
wow  it s gone 
the scorch mark has vanished 
but not the spell
brethren  continue your meal
calcifer  move the castle
100 kilometers
and send hot water to the bath
not that  too 
do you work for the
witch of the waste 
don t be stupid  the witch   
actually   
the witch    i   
confound it 
damn that witch of the waste
wait til i get my hands on her 
let me finish eating this
bugs  you d better scurry away
or i ll sweep you out
every last one of you  mocking me
there s a spell i need
later
a witch rages within
sophie
sophie  i m going out
i ll die without some fresh wood
what  what are you doing 
i ll fall  i ll fall
i m in peril
i m sweeping the ashes
won t be a minute
oh  no
oh  no
i m in danger
i m in danger   
i ll go out
oh  no
i m slipping   
hurry  sophie
try not to torment my friend
master howl  are you going out 
markl  tell our cleaning lady
not to get too carried away
what d you do  sophie 
she abused me
if i die  howl goes with me
i m the cleaning lady
it s my job to clean
no  not the 2nd floor 
if i were you  i d put your
precious things away in a hurry
save my room for later
my little outburst gave me back
my strength
what a strange house
amazing 
calcifer  calcifer 
are you moving the castle 
what a lot of fuss  of course i am
you re incredible  calcifer
your magic s first class
i misjudged you completely
you think so 
you really think so 
oh  no  not yet 
how beautiful
it s called star lake
something s stuck in there
oh  dear
lend me a hand  markl
sure
and up 
a scarecrow
he s called turnip  the turnip head
you sure like being upside down
the odd creature seems to have
taken a liking to me
he followed me here
are you sure you re not a witch  sophie 
that s right  i m the cleanest witch
in the land
turnip  don t pull it so tight
seems like he likes doing the wash
they ll dry in no time
turnip must belong to the demons
calcifer doesn t seem to mind him
you re right 
maybe he s a demon of the dead
but he led me
to this wonderful place
