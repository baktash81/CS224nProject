ive got an awful cold
i dont want you to catch it
you sound just awful
like some 90 yearold woman
ill stay in bed today
you sure all right then
here we go
youll be fine old lady
youre still healthy and these clothes
finally suit you
but i cant stay here
ouch ouch
lts not easy being old
theyre saying this war
is going to be terrible
like a hand granny
such a gentleman
but ill manage
sure old lady
but where are you off to
just a bit farther than where
youre going
i dont recommend it granny
nothing but witches and wizards ahead
thank you
going to the folding valley
at this hour
says her youngest sisters there
ive hardly made any progress at all
thank goodness ive still got my teeth
thatll make a good cane
up we go
might be a bit too thick
ouch ouch
what a stubborn branch
never underestimate
grandma sophie
heave
a scarecrow eh i thought you were
working for the witch
but how do you stand by yourself
your heads a turnip
ive always hated turnips
at least youre not
upside down anymore
so long
lts so cold
the towns still so close
dont follow me
you dont owe me a thing
you must be a magical whateveryouare
ive had enough of witches and spells
just go stand wherever you like
this is a perfect cane
thank you kindly
while youre at it could you bring me
a house to sleep in
seems you get more cunning with age
what a huge battleship
i never realized how weak you feel
when you get old
i smell smoke
maybe theres a cabin
turniphead isnt that howl s castle
this is hardly what i meant
when i asked for shelter
what is this
you call this a castle
is that the way in
just wait up there
hey there
are you going to let me on or not
my shawl
it seems warm enough inside turnip
im going in
thank you
even howl wouldnt want
an ancient heart like mine
this time its really goodbye
you may be a turnip
but youre a good turnip
may you find happiness
what is this place
just looks like a dilapidated heap
well one nice thing about getting old
is that nothing surprises you anymore
thats some spell youre under
it wont be easy to break
the fire talked
and you cant even
tell anyone about it
youre howl
wrong im the fire demon calcifer
well then calcifer can you break
the spell im under
easy
if you break the spell that chains me
to this place
ill break your spell in a flash
in other words bargain with a demon
you sure you can keep that promise
demons dont make promises
i suggest you look elsewhere
but im an exploited demon
im chained here by a contract with howl
who works me to death
im the one who keeps
this castle moving
my youve got it rough
if you figure out the secret contract
the spell will break
if you do that
ill break your spell too
all right
a bargain eh
granny
granny
boy
ive got my doubts about her
hey whos this
porthaven
when did she get in
stand by
why mayor sir
the sun is already high
is master jenkins at home
the master is out
i answer in his stead
an invitation from his majesty
it has come to war
his majesty desires every wizard
and magician even the witches
to aid our homeland
his presence is imperative
that is all
war how awful
and who might you be
calcifer let me in
dont look at me
she wandered in from the wastes
the wastes
thats strange
youre not a witch are you
a witch could never get in
porthaven again
a customer
stand by
state your purpose
mama sent me
the usual spell
behave yourself now
its not the wastes
granny are you a witch too
thats right
im the scariest witch in the land
sprinkle this powder on your ship
and the winds will favor it
sure
many thanks
i cant have you making up things
you should give up that disguise
lts not a disguise its magic
the kingsbury door
stand by
is this the residence of
wizard pendragon
it is indeed
i bear an invitation
from his majesty
please inform master pendragon
that he is required at the palace
our thanks to you
a city fit for a king
get back in or youll lose your nose
stop wandering around
thats enough
im going to get really mad
this is a magic house isnt it
oh boy
where does the black one lead
only master howl knows
im having my breakfast
but youve got bacon and eggs
we cant use the fire
when master howl s away
ill cook for you
but you cant
calcifer only obeys master howl
thats right i wont cook for you
oh heres my hat
all right calcifer
be a good fire now
forget it im a demon
i answer to no one
youll do as i say
or ill pour water on you
or would you rather i told howl
about our bargain
hey hey
i never shouldve let this old lady in
so whatll it be
thats right theres a good fire
hey hey
ill burn the bacon
calcifers doing what she says
id like some tea too
have you got a kettle
sure
welcome home master howl
you have letters from the king
to jenkins and to pendragon
calcifer youre so obedient
she bullied me
not an easy thing to do
who exactly are you
im grandma sophie

new cleaning lady

and six more eggs

brethren let us partake
of our daily bread
our daily bread
havent had a real breakfast
in a long while
so many manners to teach
so whats that in your pocket
what
i wonder what it is
let me
its scorched into the table
master howl this is
ancient sorcery
and powerful too
the witch of the waste
he who catches a falling star
oh heartless man
your heart shall be mine
well so much for the table
wow its gone
the scorch mark has vanished
but not the spell
brethren continue your meal
calcifer move the castle
100 kilometers
and send hot water to the bath
not that too

witch of the waste
dont be stupid the witch

the witch i
confound it
damn that witch of the waste

a witch rages within
sophie

im in peril
im sweeping the ashes
wont be a minute
oh no
oh no
im in danger
im in danger
ill go out
oh no
im slipping
hurry sophie
try not to torment my friend
master howl are you going out
markl tell our cleaning lady
not to get too carried away
whatd you do sophie
she abused me
if i die howl goes with me
im the cleaning lady
its my job to clean
no not the 2nd floor
if i were you id put your
precious things away in a hurry
save my room for later
my little outburst gave me back
my strength
what a strange house
amazing
calcifer calcifer
are you moving the castle
what a lot of fuss of course i am
youre incredible calcifer
your magics first class
i misjudged you completely
you think so
you really think so
oh no not yet
how beautiful
its called star lake
something s stuck in there
oh dear
lend me a hand markl
sure
and up
a scarecrow
hes called turnip the turniphead
you sure like being upside down
the odd creature seems to have
taken a liking to me
he followed me here
are you sure youre not a witch sophie
thats right im the cleanest witch
in the land
turnip dont pull it so tight
seems like he likes doing the wash
theyll dry in no time
turnip must belong to the demons
calcifer doesnt seem to mind him
youre right
maybe hes a demon of the dead
but he led me
to this wonderful place
