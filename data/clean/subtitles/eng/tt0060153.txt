millionaire bruce wayne   
    and his ward  dick grayson 
have been summoned to wayne manor   
    by an urgent but anonymous
call for help 
the invention and its custodian
are reported in grave danger   
    aboard the yacht 
never ones
to shirk responsibility   
    bruce and dick  with
characteristic speed and resolve   
    descend promptly to the batcave 
and then  as they have done
many times before   
    as batman and robin 
courageous warriors against crime   
    they are off  once again 
to the rescue 
batteries to power 
turbines to speed 
roger  ready to move out 
batmobile to airport  red alert 
prepare batcopter for takeoff 
batmobile approaching 
red alert  gotham tower to all
aircraft in the control zone 
enter your holding pattern 
batcopter cleared for takeoff 
it s good to know
they re up there doing their job 
batdrift angle  03 to starboard 
roger  correcting to port 
altitude  317  sink rate  0 49 
  drop bat ladder 
  bat ladder away 
lock computer on afterdeck 
set automatic bathold 
watch out  this could be tricky 
have no fear  i ll keep all my wits
about me  so long  for a minute 
batman to robin 
ease off on the power 
increase sink rate 
roger  wilco 
take her up 
holy sardine 
hand me down
the shark repellent bat spray 
  enough pictures 
  this press conference must be brief 
  you re lucky they ll talk to you 
  mr  merrick of the gotham city times 
a yacht approaching the city
is said to have disappeared 
  nonsense  how can a yacht disappear 
  it isn t true 
i stand on my answer 
mr  stanley of the globe 
this yacht belonged
to the famous big ben distilleries 
isn t the proprietor 
commodore schmidlapp   
   bringing a new invention
from big ben s lab 
  no more questions about that ship 
  what about that shark 
an unfortunate animal who chanced
to swallow a floating mine 
i wouldn t worry about that 
you there  miss   
comrade kitanya irenya tatanya
karenska alisoff 
from the moscow bugle 
you grace us with your presence 
may i be of service 
please  take off the mask
to give the better picture 
  batman take off his mask 
  the woman must be mad 
please  chief o hara  all of you 
this young lady is a stranger 
her request is not unnatural   
   however  impossible to grant 
  impossible 
  indeed 
if we were to remove our masks 
our true identities would be revealed 
  ruining their value as crime fighters 
  not even we know who they are 
in fact  our own relatives don t know 
but your so curious costumes   
don t be put off by them 
under this we re ordinary americans 
you re like the masked vigilantes
in the westerns 
batman and robin are
deputized agents of the law 
   support your police  is our message 
  well said  robin 
and no better way to end
this conference 
  thank you and good day 
  batman   
never mind  everybody out 
come on  we re all busy here 
a fine job  you allayed their fears 
if i d told the truth 
panic would grip the city 
the truth  and what is the truth 
a decoy  an anonymous warning   
   that schmidlapp s in danger 
to lure me into a trap 
an attempt on his life 
while they were luring you
to a watery grave   
   the yacht was being hijacked 
  precisely 
  and who behind it 
what known super criminals
are at large now 
i ll check at once  batman 
let s have the latest status report
on criminals at large  thank you 
coming up on
the closed circuit tv screen 
status report  known super criminals
not currently imprisoned 
the penguin 
that pompous waddling
master of foul play 
  the joker 
  devilish clown prince of crime 
if i had a nickel
for every time he baffled us 
the riddler loose too 
so it seems 
to plague us with his conundrums 
  gosh  and the catwoman 
  end of status report 
could be any one of them 
but which one 
which ones 
pretty fishy what happened to me
on that ladder 
  where there s a fish  there s penguin 
  wait  it happened at sea 
see   c  for catwoman 
yet  that exploding shark
was pulling my leg 
  the joker 
  it all adds up to a sinister riddle 
riddle er  riddler 
a thought strikes me 
so dreadful i scarcely dare
give it utterance 
the four of them 
their forces combined 
  holy nightmare 
  batman  could it be 
i don t know 
but i think i know
where to find a clue 
robin  to the batcave 
we haven t one moment to lose 
ahoy  catwoman 
how many times have i told you 
never use my real name in public 
you and your trained exploding shark 
how should i know they d have a can   
   of shark repellent bat spray 
you sniveling sardine 
you pompous puffed up penguin 
friends  make peace 
have a shake on me 
a joke a day keeps the gloom away 
sic them  hecate 
scratch out their eyes 
  take away that ravenous panther 
  i ll feed him to the birds 
i ll incapacitate it
with my trick confetti 
 united underworld  
we re about as united   
   as the members
of the united world headquarters 
  what s the matter with you all 
  she s right 
if we don t manage to swallow
our super criminal pride   
right  mr  riddler  quite right 
we must hang together 
or we shall hang separately 
what a pity that would be on the eve
of the greatest criminal coup ever 
  how did it go  catwoman 
  purr fectly  purr fectly 
in my disguise as kitka 
i penetrated their press conference 
  the fools are completely baffled 
  but undrowned 
yes  unfortunately 
batman s boots didn t even look damp 
our prisoner still doesn t know
he s kidnapped 
he hasn t the foggiest 
he just keeps ringing for his tea 
  there he goes again 
  take it to him  man 
come in 
your tea  commodore 
thank you  steward 
good service aboard this yacht 
we strive to give satisfaction  sir 
your face has the most ghastly pallor 
are you getting enough sea air 
my duties keep me mostly undercover 
too bad  too bad 
how much longer will this yacht
be fogbound off the grand banks 
i couldn t say  sir 
well  gives me a chance
to catch up on my dickens 
still  i d like to get to gotham city 
i ve a clever invention
with me  stored in the hold 
should be worth
millions of dollars  pip pip 
well  pip pip to you  sir  if you
wish anything further  just ring 
schmidlapp s invention in our hands   
   the whole world almost literally
in our grasp 
and batman and robin
still alive to block us 
everything pip pip with the prisoner 
he hasn t a clue 
  i bet the dynamic duo has 
  what 
a clue on how we made
that ship disappear 
  and when they solve it   
  they ll be out to investigate 
but we ll be there first 
if we hurry  that is 
catwoman  you tend
to this headquarters 
  attention  you unfathomable finks 
  yo ho 
call down to
our secret river bottom dock 
  prepare our submarine for sea 
  yo ho 
  yo ho what 
  sir 
holy merlin magician 
get set for a shock 
the batcamera was aimed at the yacht 
  my strange hunch was right 
  i don t get it   
think  as you remarked 
no one can make   
   a seagoing vessel
simply disappear 
provided it was ever
really there at all 
  you mean    
  precisely 
the yacht we thought we saw
was a mere illusion 
a tricky projection akin
to the common desert mirage 
it deceived our naked eyes   
   but was blocked
by the batcamera s batfilter 
i know where
that projection came from 
  observe that bell buoy 
  what about it 
the coordinates of our position
were 10 3 by 69 b 
feed those figures into
the navigational aid computer 
no legal bell buoy at that position 
as i surmised  an illegal projection
buoy cleverly camouflaged 
maybe the crooks left fingerprints 
good thinking  let s find out 
to the batboat  fast 
one thing i don t dig  batman 
if that ship was a mirage 
where s the real one 
taken to some secret island hideaway
with every soul aboard  save one 
  commodore schmidlapp 
  precisely 
for some reason
the hijackers needed him   
   or his invention
as part of their criminal scheme 
keep an eye on the scope 
watch for suspicious vessels 
it looks like we ve got
the whole ocean to ourselves 
diving planes  mr  bluebeard 
three degrees 
hoist three degrees 
i hope you know
what you re doing  penguin 
mr  riddler  i ignore
your insipid insinuation  sir 
mr  joker  you re leaning
on the control 
don t sound so bossy  if you please 
as the poet says 
 on land  you may command 
at sea  it is me  
now hear this  this is your captain
speaking  my fine pinioned pirates 
we re approaching the buoy 
there may be skullduggery ahead 
  yo ho 
  what  what 
unidentified small craft  bearing 113 
mr  bluebeard  hold her steady 
up periscope 
great quivering icebergs 
just as i hoped 
watch your step 
an underwater shark cage 
the source of that fish 
what cruelty 
stuffing a poor shark with deadly tnt 
nothing s sacred to those devils 
torpedoes  what are we waiting for 
chain of command  mr  riddler 
the penguin runs the ship 
now hear this  mr  joker 
load the torpedo tubes 
load torpedo tubes 
salt and corrosion 
the infamous old enemies of
the crime fighter  no prints here 
look here  batman 
that tricky mirage projector
must be behind this plate 
wow  what a set of superpower lenses 
no wonder we were fooled 
look  robin 
holy long john silver 
a pirate periscope 
he spotted us  set torpedoes
to automatic homing 
set torpedoes to automatic homing 
you crazy bird 
fire them off  quickly 
activate the remote control
penguin magnet inside that buoy 
holy glue pot  what s going on 
the fiends  they ve converted
this buoy into a gigantic magnet 
it s got us by the metallic objects
in our utility belts 
torpedo tubes armed 
batman  we re helpless
in this monstrous  invisible grip 
  steady  robin  i see one hope 
  what  batman 
if i could just pry loose
my utility belt transmitter 
  mr  joker  are you ready to fire 
  yo ho  ready to fire 
five  four  three  two 
  fire 1 
  fire 1 
torpedoes 
if i can just reverse the polarity 
send out waves of super energy 
  what happened 
  mr  joker  fire 2 
fire 2 
here comes another one 
you and your reconditioned
surplus torpedoes 
he must be using a super energy
reverse polarizer  mr  joker  fire 3 
fire 3 
here comes a third one 
confound it  the batteries are dead 
this one s getting through 
it is  it s getting through 
surface  mr  bluebeard 
let us feast our eyes
on the watery remains 
gosh  the nobility
of the almost human porpoise 
true  robin 
it was noble of that animal   
   to hurl himself into
the path of that torpedo 
he gave his life for ours 
operator  give me the pentagon 
navy department 
too bad 
admiral fangschliester s office 
hello  batman speaking 
  who is it 
  batman 
oh  batman 
hello  batman  ahoy 
what can i do for you 
hello  admiral 
a routine question 
have you recently sold surplus
submarines  if so  to whom 
just a moment 
i ll have to look that up 
keep practicing 
answer  affirmative  we disposed
of a surplus submarine on friday 
a pre atomic model 
to some chap named p n  gwynne 
  p n  gwynne 
  the penguin 
did this p n  gwynne leave an address 
just a post office box number 
would you like it 
no  thank you  admiral 
you ve been very helpful 
your tone sounds grim 
we haven t done anything foolish 
disposing of submarines to persons
who don t even leave their addresses 
  good day  admiral 
  gosh 
the penguin in command
of a pre atomic submarine 
  grave situation  robin 
  if only we knew what he was up to 
holy polaris 
from that submarine  no doubt 
that missile  it s written something 
a riddle  in the form of a joke 
let s race back to headquarters 
you know what this means  don t you 
our fear is confirmed  penguin 
joker  riddler  their forces combined 
  heaven only knows the objective 
  it may be worse 
  saints alive  how can that be 
  look at this pair of riddles 
 what does a turkey do
when he flies upside down  
  he gobbles up 
  and number two 
 what weighs 6 ounces 
sits in a tree and is dangerous  
  a sparrow with a machine gun 
  of course 
now  combine both answers 
what kind of creature would
gobble up a bird in a tree 
heaven protect us  a cat 
yes  the criminal catalyst
in this entire affair   
   our old archenemy  catwoman 
penguin  joker  riddler
and catwoman too 
the sum of the angles
of that rectangle is monstrous 
we ve been given warning 
they work to take over   
  gotham city 
  any two of them might try that 
  the whole country 
  if it were three  i d say yes 
but four 
their minimum objective must be   
   the entire world 
the united world building 
dear comrades in crime 
our objective  the security council 
sitting like fat birds in a tree
just waiting to be snatched 
and you bungled it 
the dynamic duo escaped our trap 
passing porpoises
which intercept torpedoes 
there ought to be
a piscatorial statute 
time is short  we ve got
to get batman before he gets us 
i could lure him into
a giant exploding octopus   
after one of your fishy explosions 
they re still in one piece 
i suppose they ll be broken up
by your moldy jokes 
shut up  all of you 
i see the way to do it 
we ll play each of our treacherous
trumps in one hand 
and we ll do it right here 
  how 
  how 
the end 
the end of   
we shall spring them from
the joker s jack in the box   
   through that window 
out over the sea   
   and into the waiting arms
of the penguin s exploding octopus 
the trigger  one of my riddles 
and the bait  you  catwoman 
you re mad 
the minute batman spots her   
   he ll bop her with a batarang 
you don t understand 
she will be disguised as kitka 
and as kitka  she shall lure
some millionaire into a kidnap trap 
of course 
with a clever clue pointing here 
  batman will race to the rescue 
  capital 
but who are we going to kidnap 
i know the perfect victim 
i know the perfect victim  i know 
bruce wayne  the millionaire head   
   of that disgusting do gooding
wayne foundation 
delicious  just the sort of square
citizen batman will dash to rescue 
  then snap 
  into the combination trap 
purr fect  riddler  purr fect 
comrade wayne  my name is kitanya
irenya tatanya karenska alisoff 
i m from the moscow bugle 
my friends call me kitka 
kitka  kitka  a charming acronym 
thank you  comrade wayne 
the wayne foundation is known
from leningrad to kamchatka 
it works for peace and understanding 
your picture has appeared
countless times in the moscow bugle 
i m most grateful 
i wasn t aware of that 
you found these riddles on wayne
foundation stationery under your door 
yes  comrade wayne 
that s why i brought them to you 
i thought it was some foolishness 
then i remembered 
is there not
a bourgeois criminal cad   
   the riddler 
who preys upon the workers 
your jargon is quaint  miss kitka 
but there is such a creature 
what do we do now  report
these riddles to your police   
   or perhaps
to that cossack batman 
that s hardly necessary at the moment 
doubtless it s the work
of some harmless crank 
nevertheless  shall we give
this matter further consideration   
   over dinner tonight 
what a purr fectly lovely idea 
i ll telephone to cancel
a previous engagement 
alfred will see you to the door 
do vechera 
do vechera  comrade wayne 
alfred  see miss kitka out  please 
meet me in the batcave  emergency 
very good  sir 
listen to these riddles 
tell me if you interpret them as i do 
   what has yellow skin and writes  
  a ballpoint banana 
right   what people are
always in a hurry  
rushing people  russians 
right again 
what would you say they mean 
banana  russian   
a russian will slip on a banana peel
and break their neck 
precisely  the only possible meaning 
  a clear threat to miss kitka s life 
  who 
miss kitka  the charming russian
journalist for the moscow bugle 
in some way she must have unwittingly
stumbled on the criminals  plot 
what is the scheme 
tonight bruce wayne will go out
on the town with miss kitka 
  a not displeasing chore 
  indeed 
i ve rarely met a girl   
   who s a potent argument
in favor of international relations 
you will dog our footsteps
in the batmobile 
you ll keep watch via the batscanner 
  if the riddler tries to make good   
  i ll bash him brutally 
then we close in with the police 
  got your driver s license 
  in my wallet 
good man  drive carefully  good luck 
this may be a memorable night 
this curtain which separates
our countries is so foolish 
if we could just contrive   
   some way of getting more
deeply involved with each other 
da  we must search for such a method 
it s wrong to listen to this 
some things have to be private 
even for a crime fighter 
your discretion is admirable 
master robin  yes 
  time for another check in 
  roger 
  commissioner 
  yes 
  yes  boy wonder 
  batmobile position 
gotham park 
proceeding south on west drive 
about to pass
benedict arnold monument 
still in the park  it s been
almost an hour  what are they doing 
no comment  commissioner  let s just
say  no sign of criminal activity 
yes  i understand 
i ve just thought of a clever ruse 
have chief o hara
flash the batsignal 
if you say so  but why 
the crooks will think
we re racing to headquarters 
thinking we re out of the way 
they might strike at miss kitka 
devilishly clever 
  thank you  batmobile over and out 
  right 
  chief o hara  flash the batsignal 
  yes  sir 
shades of smolensk  what is that 
incredible  i don t   
  of course  how clever 
  clever  comrade wayne 
i mean  clever device  miss kitka 
it s the batsignal 
from the roof of police headquarters 
batman must be racing
there in response 
then you did get the police
to call them in for my protection 
yes  yes 
how purr fectly wonderful of you 
i close my eyes and i dream
of those savage cossacks   
   racing over the steps
on their mission 
how strange 
i close my eyes 
and i dream of something   
   quite astonishingly different 
keep your eyes closed 
continue with this dream 
the dream continues 
it approaches a climax 
not so fast  be more slow 
miss kitka 
may i see you home
to that penthouse apartment 
  he swallowed the catbait 
  and now to make him batbait 
finks  morgan  bluebeard  quetch 
the jetpack umbrellas 
i ll slip into something
more comfortable   
   while your cocoa is warming 
is that prudent 
our instructions were to keep watch 
i don t know about prudent 
but it s the only decent thing to do 
perhaps  yes  yes 
there it is  73rd street
and concord avenue 
follow me down to the terrace 
and all my days are trances
and all my nightly dreams
are where thy dark eye glances
and where thy footstep gleams
edgar allan poe  miss kitka 
 to one in paradise   first stanza 
about that dream you had   
  do we dare 
  why not 
yes  of course  why not 
of what use is a dream if not
a blueprint for courageous action 
into action  comrade 
miss kitka 
i have the strangest feeling   
   that i am about to be utterly
and madly carried away 
  this is a kidnapping 
  our joke s on you 
you filthy criminals 
  much as one deplores indiscretion   
  right 
i ll just take one tiny  tiny peek 
  holy demolition 
  bless my dustpan 
cover the exits 
i ll race up with my batrope 
holy halloween 
strange  batman should ve
been here hours ago 
maybe you didn t leave
a clear enough clue 
i did  i can t understand why
batman hasn t dashed into our trap 
he puts his foot here 
my secret jack in the box fires   
   shooting him over the sea   
   into the waiting arms
of penguin s exploding octopus 
what a deliciously
humorous trajectory 
and nothing
to link us with the crime 
you abominable outlaws 
what have you done with miss kitka 
she s quite well  mr  wayne 
i swear by heaven 
if you ve harmed that girl   
   i ll kill you all 
i ll rend you limb from limb 
mr  wayne  must you be so impulsive 
where is she 
show me miss kitka   
   or i ll wreck this place
with my dying breath 
blindfold the captive 
lead him down the labyrinthine path
to chamber 17 
two minutes  no more 
  turn on the secret microphone 
  quiet  quiet 
  miss kitka 
  comrade wayne 
are you all right 
i ll curse myself forever 
this nasty soup we re in
is of my brewing 
if i hadn t let your beauty
lull me off guard   
off guard  comrade 
there are some things
i cannot disclose 
but we re in the hands
of the most vicious foursome 
i fear we have nothing
to look forward to but death 
it may not be that black 
comrade wayne 
batman and robin are
probably hot on our trail 
from something
i happened to overhear   
    i think we are merely
bait for batman 
once he s in their trap 
we ll be released 
a slender hope  miss kitka 
more slender than you can know 
you do not think
batman will get here 
that i cannot say 
did you overhear any mention   
   of any other prisoner
of this rotten gang 
no  i did not 
who on earth could you mean 
commodore schmidlapp
ringing for his tea 
just a thought  it doesn t matter 
speedy escape is our only hope 
a moment  while i think   
why didn  t i think of it sooner 
of what 
up my sleeve i have a radio
transmitter strapped above my elbow 
  what a curious device to carry 
  not at all 
capitalists who carry a lot of money
have safety contrivances 
if i can just get at it   
wiggle around back to back 
maybe you can reach it
with your fingers 
let s get him 
there we are 
you think you re pretty clever 
don t you 
  clever enough to outwit you 
  we ll see about that 
dear colleagues  let s see
what s strapped above his left elbow 
cretinous creatures 
i knew you d been listening in 
i told you that fish story
about a radio   
get him 
miss kitka  where are you 
  great day 
  hello  commissioner 
dick  we re late for
that demonstration  excuse us 
but you can t dash off now 
how did you escape 
  with the aid of batman 
  thank goodness for the caped crusader 
return to police headquarters 
he may wish to call you 
my fine finkish friends  you have
heard my astounding proposal 
what do you say 
what do you say  
our strike cannot be postponed 
we re at the mercy
of the gotham river tide 
it s now or never
to get through the channel 
batman will never come here now 
but the police will  any instant 
so  to the penguin s princely plan 
is it yes or no 
it s crazy  but let s try it 
we have to get batman out of the way 
oh  go ahead  penguin 
would you drop one of your dream pills
into commodore schmidlapp s tea 
  presto 
  then carry him to the submarine 
mr  riddler 
will you tell mr  quetch   
   to fetch the five guinea pigs 
fetch the guinea pigs 
yo ho ho  sir 
now  my fine fishy finks   
   you see the commodore s
pièce de  no résistance    
   an instant whiskey maker 
waiting for us to put it
to more universal use 
don t be afraid 
you ll feel nothing 
i am merely going
to temporarily extract   
   every bit of moisture
from your bodies 
it s a painless operation 
  delightful 
  dehydrated 
catwoman  will you get a dustpan   
   and put every one of them
very carefully into separate vials 
mr  riddler  would you prepare
the submarine to get underway   
   while i prepare a terrifying
demolition charge for the police 
  where do we meet 
  united world building 
gotham river 
39th floor  the elevator 
  one hour 
  one hour 
what criminal genius  catwoman 
who but a genius could conceive
such an audacious plot 
to trick batman and robin into
inviting me to their batcave   
   with five dehydrated
death dealing pirates at my command 
careful  careful 
every one of them has a mother 
out  batarang and batrope 
stand clear 
with people in weird outfits
like the supercrooks around here   
   it s amazing no one reports
this place to the police 
it s a low neighborhood 
full of rum pots 
they attribute curious sights
to alcoholic delusions 
drink is a filthy thing 
i d rather be dead than unable
to trust my own eyes 
yes  honey  there was someone
walking up the wall 
ready with super blinding batpellets 
  away  robin  away 
  but   
come on  batman 
batman 
miss kitka 
quick  everyone 
flee for your lives  into the street 
some days you just can t
get rid of a bomb 
  it s all right 
  holy heart failure 
i was able to dispose
of that bomb just in time   
   and shield myself
behind these iron pipes 
you risked your life to save
that riffraff in the bar 
they may be drinkers 
but they re also human beings   
   and may be salvaged 
i had to do it 
but we lost the trail of miss kitka 
stranded without a clue 
ahoy there  could you chaps
direct me to a policeman 
commodore schmidlapp s the name 
big ben distilleries  you know 
  holy costume party  the penguin 
  obviously 
what s his game 
  what s your game  penguin 
  penguin 
no  my name s schmidlapp 
old boy  schmidlapp 
your fingerprints will
settle that hash 
we ll check them against our mobile
anti crime file in our batmobile 
let s see your hands 
looks like plastic coated fingertips 
yes  i scorched myself
pressing a waistcoat 
i do believe the attending
surgeon did use plastic  yes 
it looks bad 
this brassy bird has us buffaloed 
not quite 
there s one method of identification
no one can evade 
retinal eye patterns 
he s right  the pattern
of blood vessels   
   in the retina 
as individual as a fingerprint 
don t you have an anti criminal 
eye pattern master file   
   in your batcave 
why don t you take me there 
  you ll submit yourself to a test 
  it might be an amusing experience 
stand by to catch him  robin 
i ll give him the batgas 
what  batgas 
an anesthetic  necessary
to prevent you from seeing   
   the entrance to the batcave 
if anyone knew that  they could
pierce the secret of our identities 
ready  commodore 
oh  i say  what deucedly strange
customs you colonials have 
well  i m ready 
to the batmobile 
this could be our break 
  i wonder why he let us take him 
  we ll soon know 
  i ve got the eye checker 
  stay on the alert 
after i give him the batwake 
we must be ready for anything 
oh  it s you 
we re here  eh  i see 
oh  what s this  oh  say 
this is extraordinary 
it s absolutely extraordinary 
i must say that your laboratory
exceeds the limits   
   of man s wildest imagination 
could i trouble you
for a glass of water 
your batgas has left me
with a parched sensation 
the water dispenser is clearly marked 
all right  thank you 
thank you  sir 
help yourself  commodore 
slake your thirst 
you ll have worse than a parched
sensation when we re through 
perhaps  perhaps  but i am
appalled by your attitude  sir 
condemning me before the facts have
been authoritatively established 
you are abrogating
my constitutional rights  sir 
all set  batman 
come on  penguin 
time to rip off your false feathers 
coming  batman 
i m coming at once 
holy hallucination 
i wish it were  but it s five
dehydrated pirates  rehydrated 
at them  me hearties 
shiver them from stem to stern 
attack them  you faltering fink 
they re gone  popped like balloons 
how did it happen 
whoever dehydrated those pirates   
   couldn t have foreseen their
rehydration with the heavy water   
   we use to recharge
the atomic pile 
it left them in an unstable condition 
you saw it yourself  the slightest
impact was sufficient   
   to instantly reduce them
to antimatter 
antimatter 
you mean  they won t be coming back 
no  robin  not in this universe 
let that be a lesson in the dangers   
   of tampering with the laws
of mother nature 
my apologies  commodore 
i ve done you a cruel injustice 
  you have 
  you were duped  brainwashed 
the criminals planted
those dehydrated thugs on you 
you were obviously
under the influence   
   of post hypnotic suggestion
when you rehydrated them 
come on down  commodore 
another sniff of batgas 
and we ll all return to the city 
are you sure you didn t
hurt your head 
perfectly  swallow this pill 
now  give our friend here
a whiff of batwake 
good morning 
what s wrong 
manifold pressure s dropping 
we d better stop and check it 
  sorry about that  won t take long 
  yes  you will 
and away we go in my birdmobile 
one side kick for a sailor 
  you okay 
  thanks to that anti penguin gas pill 
he s played right into our hands 
via batcycle to the batcopter 
we ll track him
to the gang s new hideout 
disengage go cart 
batscanner tracking
the stolen batmobile 
port two degrees 
then steady as she goes 
yo ho  port two degrees 
we re almost there 
  where are you going 
  to fire off more riddling clues 
riddler  you re mad 
penguin s finished batman by now 
that miserable  waddling
mountebank of a bird 
he couldn t finish a bag of popcorn 
say penguin failed  all the more
reason not to hand them clues 
but i must  outwitting batman
is my sole delight   
   my joy  my heaven on earth 
my very paradise 
riddler  come back 
stolen batmobile turning 
heading up gotham river drive 
polaris type missile
coming right for us 
hold on  this may be tricky 
  damage 
  the tail rotor s disengaged 
brace yourself  robin 
we re going down 
this could be the end 
now  to find my riddling
polaris skywriter 
look  look  the dynamic duo 
i got them  i got them 
holy horseshoe 
some luck  landing
on top of foam rubber 
the odds against it would make even
the most reckless gambler cringe 
true  i did think i d spotted it
out of the corner of my eye  but   
that crazy missile wrote
two more riddles 
 what goes up white and comes down
yellow and white  
an egg 
 how do you divide 17 apples
among 16 people  
make applesauce 
apples into applesauce 
a unification into one smooth mixture 
an egg  nature s perfect container 
the container of our future hopes 
a unification in a container of hope 
united world organization 
precisely 
and the security council meets today 
  if what i fear is true   
  let s commandeer a taxi 
no  not at this time of day 
luckily we re in tip top condition 
it ll be faster if we run  let s go 
we are now passing
through the grotto 
  depth  a half fathom 
  engines  dead slow astern 
dead slow astern 
as the blueprint said 
an abandoned construction elevator 
hecate  sniff out the weak spot 
  i hope penguin made it 
  who needs him 
stand back 
hey  can t you read 
a fine day for penguins 
my co conspirators 
we meet as planned 
no thanks to you  the dynamic duo
has been silenced forever 
blasted out of the sky
by a coincidence 
the delicious irony of it 
downed by riddler s polaris skywriter 
happy happenstance  hold your
breath till we cross the hall 
there are still lingering traces
of my finely filtered penguin gas 
holy marathon  i m getting a stitch 
let s hope it s a stitch in time
that saves nine 
the nine members
of the security council 
it is the opinion of her majesty
that we pursue peace at all costs 
our poor united world in microcosm 
i m afraid they ll find our humor
very  very dry 
we understand your position 
but for peace   
it has always been our policy   
quickly now 
each one in a separate vial 
and  boys  don t anybody sneeze 
  seal the building 
  turn off the ventilating system 
the security council
may have been dehydrated 
emergency  operator

emergency  operator  emergency 
up  up  up  up

  the united underworld is through 
what s this  an apparition 
one false move  and you ll find out 
we ll hurl our batarangs 
  to the elevator 
  catwoman  stop  i said 
i don t think you mean that 
miss kitka dies
if you take one more step  go 
this way  robin 
the security council  gone 
what a fiendishly clever way
to abduct nine men   
   from a heavily guarded building 
where does that elevator go 
downstairs  to an abandoned
submarine dock on the river 
holy captain nemo  they ll head
for sea by way of short island sound 
we have just one trump card left 
heaven help the world if we fail 
come on 
down periscope 
we re over the last bar 
mr  bluebeard  all engines full ahead 
yo ho  all engines full ahead 
what a delightful haul 
mr  riddler  will you prepare
those nine radio ransom messages 
and no stupid riddles 
make those messages plain 
one billion dollars cash 
from each country 
precisely  to be delivered
to our secret island   
   by the horde of trained carrier
pigeons which i shall provide 
no whimsical embellishments 
make those messages clear 
make those messages clear 
it s like a dream  pengy sweet 
nothing can stop us now 
sonar contact 
range 8000  bearing 181 
yo ho  sonar contact 
small craft at 7500  bearing 01

  the batboat 
  drat that cockleshell 
mr  bluebeard 
steady on the diving planes 
i ll man the torpedo tubes 
would you fire a surface to surface
underwater homing missile 
missile ahoy 
it has a homing device in
its nose cone  take evasive action 
no use  it s tracking us 
take my batradio 
i looked it up this morning 
that class of missile receives
on a wavelength of 164  1 
  164  1 
  quickly  send a jamming signal 
it s starting down 
farewell  batman 
farewell  dynamic duo 
holy bikini  that was close 
yo ho  small craft still closing

up to periscope depth 
yo ho  up to periscope depth 
  range 3500 
  get the batcharge launcher 
roger 
they hold nine of the world s most
eminent men in dehydrated condition 
our task is not to sink that sub 
merely to drive it to the surface 
forward torpedo tubes 
prepare to fire 
yo ho  forward torpedo tubes 
prepare to fire 
five  four  three  two   
   torpedoes  fire 
torpedoes  fire 
torpedoes away

  yo ho  dive 
down periscope 
torpedo off the port bow 
prepare to fire batcharges
in front of torpedoes 
that s too soon 
it must be batcharges 
and that means there ll be more
of the dread things meant for us 
you dismal bird 
you and your submarine 
shut up  you feline floozy 
mr  bluebeard  down 30 fathoms 
run silent  run deep 
they re diving  silent engines 
i ll circle them at full thrust speed 
diminishing radius of curvature 
roger 
what s their bearing 
  i don t know  sir 
  you don t know 
it s changing every second 
they must be circling us 
fire when ready 
i ll maintain curvature 
yo ho  compartments a  b and c
taking in water  sir 
penguin  you know i can t take water 
you cowardly kitten 
you want to live forever 
  this bird has flown around the bend 
  to cuckooland 
riddler  joker  do something 
we weren t meant for a watery grave 
now hear this  now hear this 
blow all tanks  surface  surface 
cut the batcharges 
they ve had enough  i imagine 
they re surfacing fast 
  estimated surfacing position 
  200 yards 
here they come 
diminishing speed  ready to board 
roger 
pirates  to arms 
prepare to repel boarders 
strike your colors 
we have not yet begun to fight 
attack 
bon voyage  pussy 
holy heartbreak  miss kitka 
batman  i   
say no more  robin 
it could be compromising 
of course 
it s just one of those things
in the life of every crime fighter 
it means nothing 
snap on the batcuffs 
batman to coast guard 
there s a submarine
two miles east of sandy nose 
it s filled with human jetsam 
come  take it in tow 
robin  over here  look 
the hope of the world 
tottering on the brink 
holy almost 
to think  it might have been shattered
before our very eyes 
  up  catwoman 
  the service here has gone to pot 
what the devil is this 
the captain s costume party 
holy jumble 
where s the hope of the world now 
batcentrifuge at 32 000 rpm 
increase angstrom force in vector x 
vector x up one notch 
  yes  commissioner 
  what progress  is there hope 
there s always hope 
but do you think you and robin
can separate that mingled dust   
   back into its constituent members 
with all modesty  commissioner   
   if we can t  heaven knows who can 
truer words were never spoken 
howdy  you all 
how are those boys doing up there 
batman says there s hope 
mr  president  what more can one ask 
the free world is waiting  tell batman
i salute him and wish him luck 
i needn  t tell you
with whom i have just spoken 
ready for separation 
all right 
i ll activate the computer link 
input the ethnic and national factors 
  batman  wait a minute 
  what 
well  with the way
the world is and all   
   maybe we ought to try
to improve those factors 
  reshuffle them a little 
  no 
it s not for us to tamper
with the laws of nature 
in this very batcave 
you saw a ghastly example   
   of what happens
when one tries to do that 
gosh  yes 
when you put it that way   
here we go 
separation accomplished 
ready to rehydrate 
separation accomplished 
they are ready to rehydrate 
we are ready to rehydrate 
they are ready to rehydrate 
a solemn moment  gentlemen 
one of dedication
and humble supplication 
robin  prepare to rehydrate 
ready to rehydrate 
turn on the water faucet 
success  success 
they ve done it 
they ve done it 
success  success 
we ve done it  we ve done it 
success  success 
what the    
in the interest of peace 
you must hear me out 
gentlemen  it is imperative that
we limit our conversation to peace 
who knows  robin 
this strange mixing of minds   
   may be the greatest single service
ever performed for humanity 
let s go  but inconspicuously 
through the window
