isnt that what they say
godliness
i reviewed your flight plan
not one error in a million keystrokes
phenomenal its right that
someone like you
is taking u s to titan
has the committee
approved the mission
theres been talk of delay
you shouldnt listen to talk
you leave in a week
youve got a substance test
lf you have been notified
for substance analysis
please report
to the testing center
never shy
pisses on command
i ever tell you thats
a beautiful piece of equipment
every time im here
occupational hazard
i see many in the course of any day
yours happens to be
an exceptional example
i dont know why my folks
didnt order one like that for me
by the way
have i told you about my son
no you havent
remind me to sometime
so youre about to go up
one week left
please tell me youre excited
ill tell you
at the end of the week
congratulations jerome
thank you
how many launches are there
in a day a dozen
sometimes more
youre the only one
who watches them all
if youre going to pretend
like you dont care dont look up
the most unremarkable
of events
jerome morrow
navigator first class
is about to embark on a oneyear
manned mission to titan
the 14th moon of saturn
a highly prestigious assignment
although for jerome
selection was
virtually guaranteed at birth
he s blessed with all the gifts
required for such an undertaking
a genetic quotient
second to none
no there is truly
nothing remarkable
about the progress
of jerome morrow
except that
i am not jerome morrow
i was conceived
in the riviera
not the french riviera
the detroit variety
they used to say that
a child conceived in love
has a greater chance of happiness
they don t say that anymore
ill never understand what possessed
my mother to put her faith
in gods hands rather than
those of her local geneticist
ten fingers ten toes
that s all that used to matter
not now
now only seconds old
the exact time and cause
of my death was already know
neurological condition
60 probability
manic depression
42 probability
attention deficit disorder
89 probability
heart disorder
99 probability
early fatal potential
life expectancy 302 years
thirty years
the name
anton
no
vincent anton
yeah thats a good name
i know hell do something
from an early age l came to think
of myself as others thought of me
chronically ill
every skinned knee and runny nose
was treated like
it was lifethreatening
im sorry
the insurance wont cover it
if he fell
i was told everything
i wish there was
something i could do
like most parents of their day
they were determined that
their next child would be born
in what has become
the natural way
your extracted eggs marie
have been fertilized
with antonios sperm
after screening we are
left with two healthy boys
and two very healthy girls
naturally no critical predispositions
to any major inheritable diseases
all that remains is to select
the most compatible candidate
first we lets decide on gender
have you given it any thought
we would want vincent
to have a brother you know
to play with
of course
hello vincent
you have specified hazel eyes
dark hair and fair skin
ive taken the liberty of eradicating
any potentially prejudicial conditions
premature baldness myopia
alcoholism and
addictive susceptibility
propensity for violence
obesity etc
we didnt want
diseases yes but
we were just wondering if its good
to leave a few things to chance
you want to give your child
the best possible start
believe me we have enough
imperfection built in already
your child doesnt need
any additional burdens
keep in mind
this child is still you
simply the best of you
you could conceive naturally a thousand
times and never get such a result
that s how my brother anton
came into the world
a son my father considered
worthy of his name
what did i tell you
see how hes grown
by the time we were
playing at blood brothers
i understood that there was something
different flowing through my veins
and id need
more than a drop
if l was going to get anywhere
our favorite game was chicken
when our parents werent watching
we d swim out as far as we dared
it was about who would get scared
and turn back first
come on you coward
of course
it was always me
anton was by far
the stronger swimmer
and he had no excuse
to fail
maybe it was the love of the planets
or my growing dislike for this one
but for as long as l can remember
i have dreamed of going into space
700 million 750 million
800 million
850 million
how many astronauts are there
i bet i could be one
if i wanted
dont eat that
its pluto
my goals didnt change a lot
in the intervening years
much to my parents dismay
you have to be realistic
with your heart condition
mom theres a chance theres
nothing wrong with my heart
one in a hundred
ill take it
the trouble is they wont
listen for gods sake
you gotta understand something
the only way youll see the inside
of a spaceship is to clean it
my father was right
it didnt matter how much
i lied on my resume
my real resume
was in my cells
why should anybody invest
all that money to train me
when there are a thousand other
applicants with a far cleaner profile
of course its illegal
to discriminate
genoism its called
but no one
takes the law seriously
lf you refuse to disclose
they can always take a sample
from a door handle or a handshake
even the saliva
on your application form
lf in doubt a legal drug test
can just as easily become
an illegal peek
at your future in the company
you sure you wanna do this
you know youre gonna lose
it was the last time
we swam together
and out into the open sea
like always knowing each stroke
to the horizon
was one wed have to
make back to the shore
but something was very different
about that day
every time anton
tried to pull away
he found me right beside him
until finally
the impossible happened
it was the one moment
in our lives that my brother
was not as strong as he believed
and l was not as weak
it was the moment that made
everything else possible
like many in my situation
i moved around in the next few years
getting work where l could
i mustve cleaned
half the toilets in the state
i belonged to a new underclass
no longer determined
by social status or skin color
welcome to gattaca gentlemen
no
we now have discrimination
down to a science
theres your cleaning material
start from the front
clean all the way back
and i wanna see my smiling face
on that floor
what about you your majesty
you dreaming of space
come here
you can start by
cleaning this space right here
i was never more certain of
how far away l was from my goal
than when l was
standing right beside it
when you clean the glass
dont clean it too well
what do you mean
you might get ideas
but if its clean itll be easier to
see me when im on the other side of it
for all my brave talk
i knew it was just that
no matter how much l trained
or how much l studied
the best test score wouldnt matter
without the blood test to go with it
i made up my mind to resort
to more extreme measures
the man who
showed up at my doorstep
didnt exactly advertise
in the yellow pages
stand straight
how did you hear about me
people
any distinguishing marks
tattoos scars birthmarks
no i dont think so
youre serious about this
i hope you re not wasting my time
no id give 1 00
thatll get you halfway there
thats an old edition
but i know it all by heart
by heart
you realize the commitment
is binding
you have somebody
for the genetically superior
success is easier to attain
but is by no means guaranteed
after all there is no gene for fate
and when
for one reason or another
a member of the elite
falls on hard times
their genetic identity becomes a
valued commodity for the unscrupulous
one mans loss is another man s gain
his credentials are impeccable
an expiration date
you wouldnt believe
the guys practically
gonna live forever
hes got an iq off the register
better than 2020 in both eyes
and the heart of an ox
he could run through a wall
if he could still run
actually he was
a bigtime swimming star
you could go anywhere with this guys
helix tucked under your arm
what did i tell you you look so right
together i wanna double my fee
we dont look anything alike
its close enough
when was the last time anybody
looked at a photograph
you could have my face on your name tag
for christs sake
how do i explain the accident
thats the beautiful thing
it happened out of the country
theres no record he broke his back
as far as anyones concerned
hes still a walking talking
fullyproductive member of society
you just have to get him clean
and fill in the last year of hi s life
youre a foreigner
they don t care
where you were born just how
blood has no nationality
as long as its got
what theyre looking for
its the only passport you need
who lives up there
i certainly dont
so began the process
of becoming jerome
myopia is one of the most obvious
signs of a disadvantaged birth
isnt there another way
surgerys no good
theyll see the scars
its contact lenses or a white cane
besides the color doesnt match
hes right
my eyes are prettier
you understand
i take 25 of everything you make
if it doesnt work out this equipment
must be returned within seven days
and you dont get your deposit back
i thought you said 20
he told me 20
twenty percent
its not negotiable
i guess thats it
not quite
why what
theres still the matter of height
how tall are you
46
how tall were you
before the accident
unfortunately
his profile says hes 61
ill wear lifts
even with lifts
youre not that tall
so what
we never discussed that
i thought you were serious
i am im not doing that
i wont
jerome never
questioned my commitment again
i took my mind off the pain
by reminding myself
that when l eventually did stand up
id be two inches closer to the stars
you all right
yeah
wanna go dancing
you had to be a righthander
i guess no one orders
southpaws anymore
jerome morrow
its a nice name
its my name
i cant be you without it
what makes you think
you can be me at all
look at this
look at it
its nice
im impressed is it real
are you colorblind too
its silver
so
jerome morrow was never meant
to be one step down on the podium
with all i had going for me
i was still second best
me
so how do you expect
to pull this off
i dont know exactly
your signature needs work
it soon came time to put
our preparations to the test
jerome was engineered with everything
needed to get into gattaca
except the desire to do so
do you really wanna be in there
i dont wanna be in there
i wanna be up there
whats up there
thats what i wanna find out jerome
call me eugene
my middle name
if youre gonna be jerome
you better start getting used to it
wheres my sample
in the refrigerator
door on the left
which pouch
oh any of them
should i test it
if you like
whats wrong with the machine
nothing
its a hot sample
youve been drinking again
i havent
christ its 800 in the morning
i havent
this is no joke
my interview is in an hour
there is more vodka in this piss
than there is piss
im sorry
i had half a glass to celebrate
try fridays
that one will be okay
theres only wednesday left
thats the one
listen its not too late
to back out
this is the last day youre gonna be you
and im gonna be me
well
congratulations
well what about the interview
that was it
i got it
of course you got it
and thats the way it was
daily l disposed of as much loose skin
fingernails and hair as possible
to limit how much of my invalid self
i would leave in the valid world
meanwhile eugene prepared samples of
his own superior body matter
so that l might pass for him
customized urine pouches
for the frequent substance tests
fingertip blood sachets
for security checks
vials filled with other traces
while eugene supplied me
with a new identity l paid the rent
and kept him in the style
to which hed become accustomed
eugene never suffered from the routine
discrimination of a utero
faith birth  or invalid
as we were called
a valid  a vitro  a made man
he suffered under a different burden
the burden of perfection
i was now a member
of a relatively new
and particularly detested
segment of society
one of those who refuses
to play the hand that he was dealt
i am most commonly known
as a borrowed ladder or
a degeneerate
in the guise of jerome morrow
i have risen quickly
through the ranks of gattaca
only one of the mission directors
has ever come close
to discovering my true identity
strange to think he may have more
success exposing me in death
than he ever did in life
we apologize for any inconvenience
i think we can rule out suicide
excuse me
nothing
thank you
this will take a while
we might have to push things back
irene i want you to
assist the investigators
my work director
that would put me behind
i appreciate your sacrifice
will you see that
i dont lose my place in line
your place is assured
so will you kindly inform
the authorities
that we will cooperate
in any way
although we cant tolerate
a major disruption
director
thank you
thank you
how will this affect the mission
were still going ahead
as planned
the launch windows only open
until weeks end
and tragic though
this event may be
it hasnt stopped
the planets turning has it
what happened
im going up
when
end of the week
that soon
what about the mission director
hes dead
are you serious
he was found in his office today beaten
so badly they had to check his name tag
you are serious
so thats it
theres nothing between us
and ignition
im going up
the man was murdered
so i didnt do it
i didnt say you did but the place
is gonna be crawling with hoovers
ill take my chances with the
j edgars over the mission director
besides what if they do find something
ill be out of their jurisdiction
we have to get drunk immediately
good evening gentlemen
i hope our tables ready
i understand youre leaving us
looks that way
were going to miss you
youve opened the wine i hope
of course sir
pour yourself a glass cavendish
thank you sir
how old
me
the specimen
i kissed him five minutes ago
a real good one
ill see what i can do
you want the full sequence
yes
thank you
good luck
some samples may be consumed
in the sequencing process
93 quite a catch
yes quite a catch
how many times have i told cavendish
this cant have been opened
more than five minutes ago
a wine like this needs to breathe
remember that
you know they say
when youre weightless
its the closest thing
to being in the womb
i cant believe
you pulled this off
theyre sending you up there
up there for christs sake
you of all people
i hate to think of you
alone in that room for a year
dont think about it
anyway
the room im stuck in
is bigger than your tin can
you know what im saying
what are you gonna do
i have my books
i go places in my head
id be happier if you had company
i have visitors
none that you dont pay
i wouldnt have it any other way
seriously
what are you gonna do
im gonna finish this
whats titan like
this time of year
whats titan like
titan is exactly like this
all the time
its got a cloud around it so thick
nobody can tell whats underneath
maybe theres nothing there
theres something there
you should be going
instead of me
why
because up there
your legs wouldnt matter
im scared of heights
im sorry
do you want this
ill save some for you shall l
im really sorry
youre not that sorry
dont give me a hard time
give me a break
come on
im sorry
help
i wasnt drunk
what do you mean
when i walked in front of that car
what car
i stepped right out
in front of it
id never been more sober
in my life
go to sleep
couldnt even get that right
if at first you dont succeed
try try again
go to sleep
im proud of you vincent
you must be drunk
to call me vincent
how much do you need
twenty minutes
you can go
its all right irene
youre excused
we found our man its the only
specimen we cant account for
every ten years or so
things go our way
the eyelash
what do you know about him
hes an unregistered invalid
he was a janitor here until
a few years back when he disappeared
so the specimen could have
been here since then
take a look at the floor
nothing lays around here for very long
and motive would a janitor come back
to kill a man he never knew
his profile does suggest
a violent temperament
if im not mistaken it also
suggests that hes a sick man
theres a 90 chance the owner of this
eyelash has died of natural causes
then theres a ten percent chance hes
alive its a lostandfound case sir
we find the man whos lost an eyelash
we have the murderer
ill do a cross check
find out about his family
ive already run it theres no record
of any living relative
thats a damn shame sir
check the entry log
alibis grudges
i look around
i see a lot of dry eyes
the mission director
was not universally loved
he was leading the cutbacks
in the program
with all due respect sir
whatever you say
jerome jerome
the metronome
i could play the piano
by that heartbeat of his
mr director you will be pleased
to know we have a suspect
that is a relief
who is it
we found an unaccounted for specimen
in the south wing heres his picture
an invalid
we are still following other leads
be that as it may
im having this posted immediately
im curious
an advantage i should imagine
in your line of work
your hiring practices
our recruitment philosophy
who do you have to be
to be here
naturally our standard is beyond
that of the common citizen
even amongst your people you must
have varying levels of excellence
occasionally weve had to accept
candidates with minor shortcomings
but nothing that would prohibit
someone from working in a field
such as law enforcement
for example
but now there are enough
of the right kind of people
to warrant a new measuring stick
bodies with minds to match
essential as we push out further
and further
yet you still
closely monitor performance
we have to ensure that people
are meeting their potential
and exceeding it
no one exceeds his potential
if he did
it would simply mean we did not
accurately gauge him in the first place
are you all right
terrific
this is the entry log
for the last seven days
what about you
do you have an alibi
i was alone
i find that hard to believe
excuse me
ill take care of that
i see im not the only one who
looks up every time theres a launch
hello
hello
its awful about the director
awful it didnt happen sooner
didnt the director threaten to
cancel your mission more than once
yes he did
somebody did you a favor
do they have any idea whose hand
i should be shaking
they found an eyelash
in the south wing
does it have a name
just some invalid
i had you sequenced
i read your profile
im sorry
seems youre everything
they say you are and more
what about you youre engineered
just like the rest of us
not quite
un acceptable likelihood
of heart failure
i think thats what the manual says
the only trip ill take in space is
around the sun on the satellite here
if theres anything wrong with you
i cant see it from here
if you dont believe me
here take it
if youre still interested
let me know
im sorry
the wind caught it
is this the approach path
that we discussed
absolutely director
quite right
listen to what im saying to you
i want what i ordered
its a completely different color
now im bored of talking to you
im bored
ill call you back
that was the company
that sent us your hair dye
they sent me summer wheat
instead of honey dawn
any fool knows
its two shades lighter
she said
why dont you try a change
we cant use a change
now im probably gonna have to pay
for the five boxes theyve sent me
we cant stay here
idiots i have to deal with
you wouldnt believe
they think i killed
the mission director
what makes them think that
they found my eyelash
where
in the corridor
well it could be worse
they couldve found it in your eye
theyve got my picture
plastered up all over the place
i cant turn around
without seeing my own face
theyll recognize me
they wont recognize you
i dont recognize you
they wont marry the eyelash to you
they wont believe
that one of their elite
could have suckered them
all this time
no no no
we change nothing
we do as we planned
youre jerome morrow
navigator first class
im not jerome morrow
im a murder suspect
what are you doing
thats more than a days work
wait
we cant stay here
stop that
oh fine
you leave if you want
but youre not taking that stuff
that stuff is mine
i couldve rented myself out
to somebody with a spine
if id known you were going to go
bellyup on me at the last gasp
you cant quit on me now
ive put too much into this
what do you want me to do
wheel in there
and finish the job myself
theyre going to find me
you still dont understand do you
when they look at you
they dont see you anymore
they only see me
keep your lashes on your lids
where they belong
how could you be so careless
im going out
where are you going
if im gonna get arrested tomorrow
im gonna go out tonight
you sure thats a good idea
well it was your idea
not to change anything
whos going
just everybody
everybody
if i dont go
itll look suspicious
you dont want
to look suspicious do you
thanks
who ordered this
what are we doing here
im following a lead
forgive me but thats what i do
im a detective
i follow leads
what makes you think
the owner of the eyelash is here
hes an invalid sir where do we look
for invalids but where invalids are
hes an invalid
hes an invalid clever enough
to go unregistered all these years
do you think hes likely
to lie down for us now
well what would you suggest
move the inquiry
back to the scene
draw a fivemile radius around gattaca
sweep again random stops
youre a navigator
at gattaca
thats what it says doesnt it
it doesnt say youre crippled
im not crippled
i hurt my leg training you moron
how dare you question me
yeah right
whats your number
all right forget it
whats your number
you fucking flatfoot
i said forget it
what do you want an apology
it gets to you doesnt it
it gets to you that i can do
what you can only dream of
im getting off this ball of dirt
how dare you question me
thats harassment
my mistake
whats your number
may i remind you
that this is a crime scene
whats this man doing here
what are you doing old man
doing my job sir
this is evidence
but its just trash
you didnt know
oh yes
wonderful wasnt it
twelve fingers or one
its how you play
that piece can only
be played with 12
whats all this about
its probably nothing
you better not i dont want to give you
a contaminated specimen
get my meaning
thanks
you never know
where those swabs have been
i want to show you something
come on
well miss it
come on
well miss it
what did i tell you
strange
what
your eyes look different
i guess it must be the light
must be
positive match
im impressed
the cup was definitely used
since the original sweep
two samples two days
either the suspect returned to the scene
of the crime to get a drink of water
or he still works there
i thought we checked
all the service staff
i dont think he cleans up
the place anymore
i have a feeling he might be there
under false pretenses
a borrowed ladder
at gattaca
its farfetched
but its not impossible
i find it hard to believe
he could be one of their elite workers
he wouldnt have the mental faculty
or the physical stamina
maybe youre underestimating him
maybe he is an impostor
and maybe the director found out
that could be his motive lets sample
every internal employee intravenously
twothirds of their work force
fall under that category
wed close them down for days a
fingertip or urine sample is sufficient
i suggest blood from the vein
i hope im not out of line
its only a matter of time sir
whats with the plungers lamar
you open up a blood bank
the gentlemen of law enforcement
are concerned
that my testing methods
may have been compromised
goddamn
im sorry
are you out of practice
here let me look at that
its all right
luckily it looks as though
we have enough
if you need more you can always
get it off his shoes
so you didnt do it after all
i guess somebody beat me to it
i guess
i leave in two days
i guess you know that
but
thats the last
somethings not right
hes not here
no we missed something
i say we test again
test i cannot allow you
to disrupt operations any further
youre not concerned about having
a murderer in your midst
right now your presence
is creating more of a threat
the window for our latest launch
is open for seven days
once every 70 years
so its rather crucial
we leave on time
the mission means a great deal
to you doesnt it
and your late colleague
opposed it didnt he
take another look
at my profile detective
you wont find a violent bone
in my body
my apologies director
we wont trouble you any further
this is not the only place
we can look
lets start making our rounds
im luckier than most
not as lucky as some
i know something about that
you jerome
what heart problem
did you ever have
did you get yours broken once
i had this crazy idea
that you were more interested
in the murder case than me
youre right
thats a crazy idea
would you like to dance
its funny
you work so hard
and you do everything you can
to get away from a place
and when you finally
get your chance to leave
you find a reason to stay
a year is a long time
not so long
just once around the sun
hello everyone
im your detective for the evening
please dont leave the premises
i said nobody leave
am i speaking
in some strange foreign language
check for hairpieces lenses dentures
i want napkins i want cigarette butts
i want the saliva off teacups
thats a familiar face
check him out will you
i thought you wanted to dance
excuse me where are you going
yeah i know just a minute
are you insane
come on
where did they go
come here come on
dont you understand i cant do that
you just did
dont touch your face
dont swallow dont spit
lets clean his teeth
whos vincent
dont say anything
what happened
the scars on your legs
you remember the 99 chrysler lebaron
this is the exact height
of the front fender
i looked left instead of right
did you just make that up
or do you use it all the time
i use it all the time
i know you had something to do
with the directors death
thats not true irene
isnt that the man from last night
hes nobody
hes one of our best
im certain he has nothing
to do with this business
you dont look well jerome
why dont you go home
can i help you
im looking for jerome morrow
im sorry hes ill with nausea
its quite common before a mission
really
i ought to pay him a visit
i understand you can show me the way
you dont know who he is do you
hello
eugene i need you
to be yourself for the day
i was never very good at it
remember
the investigators are coming by
im supposed to be sick
so you keep telling me
how long have i got
not long
i guess hes not home
hello
im here to see jerome morrow
yes thats me
come up
i guess hes home
come in
hello sweetheart
wheres my kiss
good to see youre feeling better
of course now that youre here
whos your friend
how can i help
its about the director
oh again
i hope its no trouble
no no trouble
forgive me for not giving you
a guided tour
couldnt we do this another time
this wont take a moment
maybe he can tell me what ive got
who were you expecting
yes
we have our man sir
you have him
we have him in custody
ill come right away
how are you jerome
not bad jerome
how the hell did you get up here
oh i could always walk
ive been faking it
dont touch me
listen to me
i dont even know who you are
im the same person i was yesterday
i cant hear any more
of your lies jerome
my name is vincent
i am vincent anton freeman
im a faith birth degeneerate
whatever you want to call it
but i am not a murderer
youre a god child
but we do have one thing in common
only i dont have 20 or 30 years left
mine is already 1 0000 beats overdue
its not possible
you are the authority
on what is not possible
arent you irene
they have got you looking
so hard for any flaw
that after a while
thats all that you see
for whatever its worth
im here to tell you
that it is possible
it is possible
congratulations sir
we did it
his spit was found
in the dead directors eye
while i was busy obsessing
about an eyelash your instincts
took us in the right direction
so the invalid had nothing
to do with this
our friend here acted alone
this mission meant everything to him
didnt it
if they miss this launch window
he wont live to see the next one
and since nothing can stop the launch
now hes being very cooperative
so i imagine
youll be celebrating tonight sir
of course
i think she likes us
yeah sure just give her a little time
shell get used to the idea
what was he like
who the cop
