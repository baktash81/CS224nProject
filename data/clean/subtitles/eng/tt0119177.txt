  isn t that what they say 
   godliness  
i reviewed your flight plan 
not one error in a million keystrokes 
phenomenal  it s right that
someone like you   
is taking u s to titan 
has the committee
approved the mission 
there s been talk of delay 
you shouldn t listen to talk 
you leave in a week 
you ve got a substance test 
lf you have been notified
for substance analysis   
please report
to the testing center 
never shy 
pisses on command 
i ever tell you that s
a beautiful piece of equipment 
every time i m here 
occupational hazard 
i see many in the course of any day 
yours happens to be
an exceptional example 
i don t know why my folks
didn t order one like that for me 
by the way   
have i told you about my son 
  no  you haven t 
  remind me to sometime 
so you re about to go up 
one week left 
please tell me you re excited 
i ll tell you
at the end of the week 
congratulations  jerome 
thank you 
how many launches are there
in a day  a dozen 
sometimes more 
you re the only one
who watches them all 
if you re going to pretend
like you don t care  don t look up 
the most unremarkable
of events 
jerome morrow 
navigator first class   
is about to embark on a one year
manned mission to titan   
the 14th moon of saturn 
a highly prestigious assignment 
although for jerome   
selection was
virtually guaranteed at birth 
he  s blessed with all the gifts
required for such an undertaking 
a genetic quotient
second to none 
no  there is truly
nothing remarkable   
about the progress
of jerome morrow 
except that
i am not jerome morrow 
i was conceived
in the riviera 
not the french riviera 
the detroit variety 
they used to say that
a child conceived in love   
has a greater chance of happiness 
they don  t say that anymore 
i ll never understand what possessed
my mother to put her faith   
in god s hands rather than
those of her local geneticist 
ten fingers  ten toes 
that  s all that used to matter 
not now 
now  only seconds old   
the exact time and cause
of my death was already know 
neurological condition  
60  probability 
manic depression  
42  probability 
attention deficit disorder 
89  probability 
heart disorder  
99  probability 
early fatal potential 
life expectancy  30 2 years 
thirty years 
the name 
  anton 
  no 
vincent anton 
yeah  that s a good name 
i know he ll do something 
from an early age l came to think
of myself as others thought of me 
chronically ill 
every skinned knee and runny nose   
was treated like
it was life threatening 
i m sorry 
the insurance won t cover it 
  if he fell  
  i was told everything  
i wish there was
something i could do 
like most parents of their day   
they were determined that
their next child would be born   
in what has become
the natural way 
your extracted eggs  marie   
have been fertilized
with antonio s sperm 
after screening  we are
left with two healthy boys   
and two very healthy girls 
naturally  no critical predispositions
to any major inheritable diseases 
all that remains is to select
the most compatible candidate 
first  we let s decide on gender 
have you given it any thought 
we would want vincent
to have a brother  you know   
to play with 
of course 
hello  vincent 
you have specified hazel eyes 
dark hair and fair skin 
i ve taken the liberty of eradicating
any potentially prejudicial conditions 
premature baldness  myopia   
alcoholism and
addictive susceptibility   
propensity for violence 
obesity  etc 
we didn t want  
diseases  yes  but  
we were just wondering if it s good
to leave a few things to chance 
you want to give your child
the best possible start 
believe me  we have enough
imperfection built in already 
your child doesn t need
any additional burdens 
keep in mind
this child is still you 
simply the best of you 
you could conceive naturally a thousand
times and never get such a result 
that  s how my brother  anton 
came into the world 
a son my father considered
worthy of his name 
what did i tell you 
see how he s grown 
by the time we were
playing at blood brothers   
i understood that there was something
different flowing through my veins   
and i d need
more than a drop   
if l was going to get anywhere 
our favorite game was chicken 
when our parents weren t watching 
we  d swim out as far as we dared 
it was about who would get scared
and turn back first 
come on  you coward  
of course 
it was always me 
anton was by far
the stronger swimmer   
and he had no excuse
to fail 
maybe it was the love of the planets   
or my growing dislike for this one 
but for as long as l can remember 
i have dreamed of going into space 
700 million  750 million 
800 million 
850 million 
how many astronauts are there 
i bet i could be one
if i wanted 
don t eat that 
it s pluto 
my goals didn t change a lot
in the intervening years   
much to my parents  dismay 
you have to be realistic 
with your heart condition  
mom  there s a chance there s
nothing wrong with my heart 
one in a hundred 
  i ll take it 
  the trouble is  they won t 
listen  for god s sake   
you gotta understand something 
the only way you ll see the inside
of a spaceship is to clean it 
my father was right 
it didn t matter how much
i lied on my resume 
my real resume
was in my cells 
why should anybody invest
all that money to train me   
when there are a thousand other
applicants with a far cleaner profile 
of course  it s illegal
to discriminate 
 genoism   it s called 
but no one
takes the law seriously 
lf you refuse to disclose   
they can always take a sample
from a door handle or a handshake   
even the saliva
on your application form 
lf in doubt  a legal drug test
can just as easily become   
an illegal peek
at your future in the company 
you sure you wanna do this 
you know you re gonna lose 
it was the last time
we swam together   
and out into the open sea   
like always  knowing each stroke
to the horizon   
was one we d have to
make back to the shore 
but something was very different
about that day 
every time anton
tried to pull away   
he found me right beside him 
until finally 
the impossible happened 
it was the one moment
in our lives that my brother   
was not as strong as he believed
and l was not as weak 
it was the moment that made
everything else possible 
like many in my situation   
i moved around in the next few years 
getting work where l could 
i must ve cleaned
half the toilets in the state 
i belonged to a new underclass   
no longer determined
by social status or skin color 
  welcome to gattaca  gentlemen 
  no 
we now have discrimination
down to a science 
there s your cleaning material 
start from the front 
clean all the way back 
and i wanna see my smiling face
on that floor 
what about you  your majesty 
you dreaming of space 
come here 
you can start by
cleaning this space right here 
i was never more certain of
how far away l was from my goal   
than when l was
standing right beside it 
when you clean the glass 
don t clean it too well 
what do you mean 
you might get ideas 
but if it s clean  it ll be easier to
see me when i m on the other side of it 
for all my brave talk 
i knew it was just that 
no matter how much l trained
or how much l studied   
the best test score wouldn t matter
without the blood test to go with it 
i made up my mind to resort
to more extreme measures 
the man who
showed up at my doorstep   
didn t exactly advertise
in the yellow pages 
stand straight 
  how did you hear about me 
  people 
any distinguishing marks 
tattoos  scars  birthmarks 
no  i don t think so 
you re serious about this 
i hope you  re not wasting my time 
no  i d give 1 00   
that ll get you halfway there 
that s an old edition 
but i know it all by heart 
by heart 
you realize the commitment
is binding 
you have somebody 
for the genetically superior 
success is easier to attain   
but is by no means guaranteed 
after all  there is no gene for fate 
and when 
for one reason or another   
a member of the elite
falls on hard times   
their genetic identity becomes a
valued commodity for the unscrupulous 
one man s loss is another man  s gain 
his credentials are impeccable 
an expiration date
you wouldn t believe 
the guy s practically
gonna live forever 
he s got an i q  off the register 
better than 20 20 in both eyes 
and the heart of an ox 
he could run through a wall 
if he could still run 
actually  he was
a big time swimming star 
you could go anywhere with this guy s
helix tucked under your arm 
what did i tell you  you look so right
together i wanna double my fee 
  we don t look anything alike 
  it s close enough 
when was the last time anybody
looked at a photograph 
you could have my face on your name tag 
for christ s sake 
  how do i explain the accident 
  that s the beautiful thing 
it happened out of the country 
there s no record he broke his back 
as far as anyone s concerned   
he s still a walking  talking 
fully productive member of society 
you just have to get him clean
and fill in the last year of hi s life 
you re a foreigner 
they don  t care
where you were born  just how 
blood has no nationality 
as long as it s got
what they re looking for   
it s the only passport you need 
who lives up there 
i certainly don t 
so began the process
of becoming jerome 
myopia is one of the most obvious
signs of a disadvantaged birth 
isn t there another way 
surgery s no good 
they ll see the scars 
it s contact lenses or a white cane 
besides  the color doesn t match 
he s right 
my eyes are prettier 
you understand
i take 25  of everything you make 
if it doesn t work out  this equipment
must be returned within seven days 
and you don t get your deposit back 
  i thought you said 20  
  he told me 20  
  twenty percent 
  it s not negotiable 
i guess that s it 
not quite 
  why  what 
  there s still the matter of height 
  how tall are you 
  4 6  
how tall were you
before the accident 
unfortunately 
his profile says he s 6 1   
i ll wear lifts 
even with lifts 
you re not that tall 
so  what 
we never discussed that 
i thought you were serious 
i am  i m not doing that 
i won t 
jerome never
questioned my commitment again 
i took my mind off the pain
by reminding myself   
that when l eventually did stand up
i d be two inches closer to the stars 
you all right 
yeah 
wanna go dancing 
you had to be a right hander 
i guess no one orders
southpaws anymore 
jerome morrow 
it s a nice name 
  it s my name 
  i can t be you without it 
what makes you think
you can be me at all 
look at this 
look at it 
it s nice 
i m impressed  is it real 
are you colorblind too 
  it s silver 
  so 
jerome morrow was never meant
to be one step down on the podium 
with all i had going for me   
i was still second best 
me 
so how do you expect
to pull this off 
i don t know exactly 
your signature needs work 
it soon came time to put
our preparations to the test 
jerome was engineered with everything
needed to get into gattaca   
except the desire to do so 
do you really wanna be in there 
i don t wanna be in there 
i wanna be up there 
what s up there 
that s what i wanna find out  jerome 
call me eugene 
my middle name 
if you re gonna be jerome 
you better start getting used to it 
where s my sample 
in the refrigerator 
door on the left 
which pouch 
oh  any of them 
should i test it 
if you like 
  what s wrong with the machine 
  nothing 
it s a hot sample 
you ve been drinking again 
  i haven t 
  christ  it s 8 00 in the morning  
i haven t 
this is no joke 
my interview is in an hour 
there is more vodka in this piss
than there is piss 
i m sorry 
i had half a glass to celebrate 
try friday s 
that one will be okay 
  there s only wednesday left 
  that s the one 
listen  it s not too late
to back out 
this is the last day you re gonna be you
and i m gonna be me 
well 
congratulations 
well  what about the interview 
that was it 
i got it 
of course you got it 
and that s the way it was 
daily  l disposed of as much loose skin 
fingernails and hair as possible   
to limit how much of my in valid self
i would leave in the valid world 
meanwhile  eugene prepared samples of
his own superior body matter   
so that l might pass for him 
customized urine pouches
for the frequent substance tests   
fingertip blood sachets
for security checks   
vials filled with other traces 
while eugene supplied me
with a new identity  l paid the rent   
and kept him in the style
to which he d become accustomed 
eugene never suffered from the routine
discrimination of a  utero    
  faith birth    or   in valid  
as we were called 
a   valid     a   vitro     a   made man 
he suffered under a different burden 
the burden of perfection 
i was now a member
of a relatively new   
and particularly detested
segment of society 
one of those who refuses
to play the hand that he was dealt 
i am most commonly known
as a   borrowed ladder   or   
a   de gene erate    
in the guise of jerome morrow   
i have risen quickly
through the ranks of gattaca 
only one of the mission directors
has ever come close   
to discovering my true identity 
strange to think  he may have more
success exposing me in death   
than he ever did in life 
we apologize for any inconvenience 
  i think we can rule out suicide 
  excuse me 
nothing 
thank you 
this will take a while 
we might have to push things back 
irene  i want you to
assist the investigators 
my work  director 
that would put me behind 
i appreciate your sacrifice 
will you see that
i don t lose my place in line 
your place is assured 
so  will you kindly inform
the authorities   
that we will cooperate
in any way   
although we can t tolerate
a major disruption 
  director  
  thank you 
thank you 
how will this affect the mission 
we re still going ahead
as planned 
the launch window s only open
until week s end   
and tragic though
this event may be   
it hasn t stopped
the planets  turning  has it 
  what happened 
  i m going up 
when 
end of the week 
that soon 
what about the mission director 
he s dead 
are you serious 
he was found in his office today beaten
so badly they had to check his name tag 
you are serious 
so that s it 
there s nothing between us
and ignition 
i m going up 
  the man was murdered 
  so  i didn t do it 
i didn t say you did  but the place
is gonna be crawling with hoovers 
i ll take my chances with the
 j  edgars  over the mission director 
besides  what if they do find something 
i ll be out of their jurisdiction 
we have to get drunk immediately 
  good evening  gentlemen 
  i hope our table s ready 
  i understand you re leaving us 
  looks that way 
  we re going to miss you 
  you ve opened the wine  i hope 
  of course  sir 
  pour yourself a glass  cavendish 
thank you  sir 
how old 
  me 
  the specimen 
i kissed him five minutes ago 
a real good one 
i ll see what i can do 
  you want the full sequence 
  yes 
thank you 
good luck 
some samples may be consumed
in the sequencing process 
9 3  quite a catch 
yes  quite a catch 
how many times have i told cavendish 
this can t have been opened
more than five minutes ago 
a wine like this needs to breathe 
remember that 
you know  they say
when you re weightless   
it s the closest thing
to being in the womb 
i can t believe
you pulled this off 
they re sending you up there 
up there  for christ s sake 
you  of all people 
i hate to think of you
alone in that room for a year 
don t think about it 
anyway   
the room i m stuck in
is bigger than your tin can 
you know what i m saying 
what are you gonna do 
i have my books 
i go places in my head 
  i d be happier if you had company 
  i have visitors 
  none that you don t pay 
  i wouldn t have it any other way 
seriously 
what are you gonna do 
i m gonna finish this 
what s titan like
this time of year 
what s titan like 
titan is exactly like this 
all the time 
it s got a cloud around it so thick
nobody can tell what s underneath 
maybe there s nothing there 
there s something there 
you should be going
instead of me 
why 
because up there
your legs wouldn t matter 
i m scared of heights 
i m sorry 
do you want this 
i ll save some for you  shall l 
  i m really sorry 
  you re not that sorry 
don t give me a hard time 
give me a break 
come on  
  i m sorry 
  help 
i wasn t drunk 
  what do you mean 
  when i walked in front of that car 
what car 
i stepped right out
in front of it 
i d never been more sober
in my life 
  go to sleep 
  couldn t even get that right 
 if at first you don t succeed 
try  try again  
go to sleep 
i m proud of you  vincent 
you must be drunk
to call me vincent 
  how much do you need 
  twenty minutes 
you can go 
it s all right  irene 
you re excused 
we found our man  it s the only
specimen we can t account for 
every ten years or so 
things go our way 
the eyelash 
what do you know about him 
he s an unregistered in valid 
he was a janitor here until
a few years back when he disappeared 
so the specimen could have
been here since then 
take a look at the floor 
nothing lays around here for very long 
and motive  would a janitor come back
to kill a man he never knew 
his profile does suggest
a violent temperament 
if i m not mistaken  it also
suggests that he s a sick man 
there s a 90   chance the owner of this
eyelash has died of natural causes 
then there s a ten percent chance he s
alive  it s a lost and found case  sir 
we find the man who s lost an eyelash 
we have the murderer 
i ll do a cross check 
find out about his family  
i ve already run it  there s no record
of any living relative 
that s a damn shame  sir 
check the entry log 
alibis  grudges 
i look around 
i see a lot of dry eyes 
the mission director
was not universally loved 
he was leading the cutbacks
in the program 
with all due respect  sir  
whatever you say 
jerome  jerome 
the metronome 
i could play the piano
by that heartbeat of his 
mr  director  you will be pleased
to know we have a suspect 
that is a relief 
who is it 
we found an unaccounted for specimen
in the south wing  here s his picture 
  an in valid 
  we are still following other leads 
be that as it may 
i m having this posted immediately 
i m curious 
an advantage  i should imagine 
in your line of work 
your hiring practices 
our recruitment philosophy 
who do you have to be
to be here 
naturally  our standard is beyond
that of the common citizen 
even amongst your people  you must
have varying levels of excellence 
occasionally we ve had to accept
candidates with minor shortcomings   
but nothing that would prohibit
someone from working in a field   
such as law enforcement 
for example 
but now there are enough
of the right kind of people   
to warrant a new measuring stick 
bodies with minds to match 
essential as we push out further
and further 
yet you still
closely monitor performance 
we have to ensure that people
are meeting their potential 
  and exceeding it 
  no one exceeds his potential 
if he did 
it would simply mean we did not
accurately gauge him in the first place 
  are you all right 
  terrific 
this is the entry log
for the last seven days 
what about you 
do you have an alibi 
  i was alone 
  i find that hard to believe 
excuse me 
i ll take care of that 
i see i m not the only one who
looks up every time there s a launch 
  hello 
  hello 
it s awful about the director 
awful it didn t happen sooner 
didn t the director threaten to
cancel your mission more than once 
  yes  he did 
  somebody did you a favor 
do they have any idea whose hand
i should be shaking 
they found an eyelash
in the south wing 
  does it have a name 
  just some in valid 
i had you sequenced 
i read your profile 
i m sorry 
seems you re everything
they say you are and more 
what about you  you re engineered
just like the rest of us 
not quite 
 un acceptable likelihood
of heart failure  
i think that s what the manual says 
the only trip i ll take in space is
around the sun on the satellite here 
if there s anything wrong with you 
i can t see it from here 
if you don t believe me  
here  take it 
if you re still interested 
let me know 
i m sorry 
the wind caught it 
is this the approach path
that we discussed 
absolutely  director 
quite right 
listen to what i m saying to you 
i want what i ordered 
it s a completely different color 
now  i m bored of talking to you 
i m bored 
i ll call you back 
that was the company
that sent us your hair dye 
they sent me   summer wheat 
instead of  honey dawn  
any fool knows
it s two shades lighter 
she said 
 why don t you try a change  
we can t use a change 
now i m probably gonna have to pay
for the five boxes they ve sent me 
we can t stay here 
idiots i have to deal with 
you wouldn t believe 
they think i killed
the mission director 
  what makes them think that 
  they found my eyelash 
where 
in the corridor 
well  it could be worse 
they could ve found it in your eye 
they ve got my picture
plastered up all over the place 
i can t turn around
without seeing my own face 
  they ll recognize me 
  they won t recognize you 
i don t recognize you  
they won t marry the eyelash to you 
they won t believe
that one of their elite   
could have suckered them
all this time 
no  no  no 
we change nothing 
we do as we planned 
you re jerome morrow 
navigator first class 
i m not jerome morrow 
i m a murder suspect 
what are you doing 
that s more than a day s work 
  wait 
  we can t stay here 
stop that 
oh  fine 
you leave if you want 
but you re not taking that stuff 
that stuff is mine 
i could ve rented myself out
to somebody with a spine   
if i d known you were going to go
belly up on me at the last gasp 
you can t quit on me now 
i ve put too much into this 
what do you want me to do 
wheel in there
and finish the job myself 
they re going to find me 
you still don t understand  do you 
when they look at you 
they don t see you anymore 
they only see me 
keep your lashes on your lids
where they belong 
how could you be so careless 
i m going out 
where are you going 
if i m gonna get arrested tomorrow 
i m gonna go out tonight 
  you sure that s a good idea 
  well  it was your idea   
not to change anything 
  who s going 
  just everybody 
everybody 
if i don t go 
it ll look suspicious 
you don t want
to look suspicious  do you 
thanks 
who ordered this 
what are we doing here 
i m following a lead 
forgive me  but that s what i do 
i m a detective 
i follow leads 
what makes you think
the owner of the eyelash is here 
he s an in valid  sir  where do we look
for in valids but where in valids are 
he s an in valid 
he s an in valid clever enough
to go unregistered all these years 
do you think he s likely
to lie down for us now 
  well  what would you suggest 
  move the inquiry   
back to the scene 
draw a five mile radius around gattaca 
sweep again  random stops 
you re a navigator 
at gattaca 
that s what it says  doesn t it 
it doesn t say you re crippled 
i m not crippled 
i hurt my leg training  you moron 
how dare you question me 
yeah  right 
  what s your number 
  all right  forget it 
what s your number 
you fucking flatfoot 
i said forget it 
what do you want  an apology 
it gets to you  doesn t it 
it gets to you that i can do
what you can only dream of 
i m getting off this ball of dirt 
how dare you question me 
  that s harassment 
  my mistake 
what s your number 
may i remind you
that this is a crime scene 
what s this man doing here 
  what are you doing  old man 
  doing my job  sir 
  this is evidence 
  but it s just trash 
you didn t know 
  oh  yes 
  wonderful  wasn t it 
twelve fingers or one 
it s how you play 
that piece can only
be played with 12 
what s all this about 
it s probably nothing 
you better not  i don t want to give you
a contaminated specimen 
get my meaning 
thanks 
you never know
where those swabs have been 
i want to show you something 
come on  
we ll miss it 
come on 
we ll miss it 
what did i tell you 
  strange 
  what 
  your eyes look different 
  i guess it must be the light 
must be 
positive match  
i m impressed 
the cup was definitely used
since the original sweep 
two samples  two days 
either the suspect returned to the scene
of the crime to get a drink of water   
or he still works there 
i thought we checked
all the service staff 
i don t think he cleans up
the place anymore 
i have a feeling he might be there
under false pretenses 
a borrowed ladder 
at gattaca 
it s far fetched 
but it s not impossible 
i find it hard to believe
he could be one of their elite workers 
he wouldn t have the mental faculty
or the physical stamina 
maybe you re underestimating him 
maybe he is an impostor 
and maybe the director found out 
that could be his motive  let s sample
every internal employee intravenously 
two thirds of their work force
fall under that category 
we d close them down for days  a
fingertip or urine sample is sufficient 
i suggest blood from the vein 
i hope i m not out of line 
it s only a matter of time  sir 
what s with the plungers  lamar 
you open up a blood bank 
the gentlemen of law enforcement
are concerned   
that my testing methods
may have been compromised 
  goddamn  
  i m sorry 
  are you out of practice 
  here  let me look at that 
it s all right 
luckily  it looks as though
we have enough 
if you need more  you can always
get it off his shoes 
so you didn t do it  after all  
i guess somebody beat me to it 
i guess 
i leave in two days 
i guess you know that 
but  
that s the last 
  something s not right 
  he s not here 
no  we missed something 
i say we test again 
test  i cannot allow you   
to disrupt operations any further 
you re not concerned about having
a murderer in your midst 
right now your presence
is creating more of a threat 
the window for our latest launch
is open for seven days   
once every 70 years   
so it s rather crucial
we leave on time 
the mission means a great deal
to you  doesn t it 
and your late colleague
opposed it  didn t he 
take another look
at my profile  detective 
you won t find a violent bone
in my body 
my apologies  director 
we won t trouble you any further 
this is not the only place
we can look 
let s start making our rounds 
i m luckier than most 
not as lucky as some 
  i know something about that 
  you  jerome 
what heart problem
did you ever have 
did you get yours broken once 
i had this crazy idea   
that you were more interested
in the murder case than me 
you re right 
that s a crazy idea 
would you like to dance 
it s funny 
you work so hard   
and you do everything you can
to get away from a place   
and when you finally
get your chance to leave   
you find a reason to stay 
a year is a long time 
not so long 
just once around the sun 
hello  everyone 
i m your detective for the evening 
please don t leave the premises 
i said nobody leave 
am i speaking   
in some strange foreign language 
check for hairpieces  lenses  dentures 
i want napkins  i want cigarette butts 
i want the saliva off teacups 
that s a familiar face 
check him out  will you 
i thought you wanted to dance 
  excuse me  where are you going 
  yeah  i know  just a minute 
  are you insane 
  come on  
where did they go 
come here  come on 
  don t you understand  i can t do that 
  you just did 
don t touch your face 
don t swallow  don t spit 
let s clean his teeth 
who s vincent 
don t say anything 
what happened 
the scars on your legs 
you remember the  99 chrysler lebaron 
this is the exact height
of the front fender 
i looked left instead of right 
did you just make that up 
or do you use it all the time 
i use it all the time 
i know you had something to do
with the director s death 
that s not true  irene 
isn t that the man from last night 
he s nobody 
he s one of our best 
i m certain he has nothing
to do with this business 
you don t look well  jerome 
why don t you go home 
  can i help you 
  i m looking for jerome morrow 
i m sorry  he s ill with nausea 
it s quite common before a mission 
really 
i ought to pay him a visit 
i understand you can show me the way 
you don t know who he is  do you 
hello 
eugene  i need you
to be yourself for the day 
i was never very good at it 
remember 
the investigators are coming by 
i m supposed to be sick 
so you keep telling me 
how long have i got 
not long 
i guess he s not home 
  hello 
  i m here to see jerome morrow 
yes  that s me 
come up 
i guess he s home 
come in  
hello  sweetheart 
where s my kiss 
good to see you re feeling better 
of course  now that you re here 
who s your friend 
how can i help 
it s about the director 
oh  again 
  i hope it s no trouble 
  no  no trouble 
forgive me for not giving you
a guided tour 
  couldn t we do this another time 
  this won t take a moment 
maybe he can tell me what i ve got 
who were you expecting 
  yes 
  we have our man  sir 
  you have him 
  we have him in custody 
i ll come right away 
how are you  jerome 
not bad  jerome 
  how the hell did you get up here 
  oh  i could always walk 
i ve been faking it 
  don t touch me 
  listen to me 
i don t even know who you are 
i m the same person i was yesterday 
i can t hear any more
of your lies  jerome 
my name is vincent 
i am vincent anton freeman 
i m a faith birth  de gene erate 
whatever you want to call it 
but i am not a murderer 
you re a god child 
but we do have one thing in common 
only i don t have 20 or 30 years left 
mine is already 1 0 000 beats overdue 
  it s not possible 
  you are the authority   
on what is not possible 
aren t you  irene 
they have got you looking
so hard for any flaw   
that after a while
that s all that you see 
for whatever it s worth   
i m here to tell you
that it is possible 
it is possible 
congratulations  sir 
we did it 
his spit was found
in the dead director s eye 
while i was busy obsessing
about an eyelash  your instincts   
took us in the right direction 
so the in valid had nothing
to do with this 
our friend here acted alone 
this mission meant everything to him 
didn t it 
if they miss this launch window 
he won t live to see the next one 
and since nothing can stop the launch
now  he s being very cooperative 
so i imagine   
you ll be celebrating tonight  sir 
of course 
i think she likes us 
yeah  sure  just give her a little time 
she ll get used to the idea 
  what was he like 
  who  the cop 
  he was just a cop 
  did you catch his name 
my name was the topic 
yeah  well  he ll be back 
they have their man 
it s over 
no  it s not over 
i have to meet him 
my god  you have changed 
don t you recognize your own brother 
are we brothers 
our parents both died
thinking they d outlived you 
i had my doubts 
what are you doing here  anton 
i should ask you that question 
i have a right to be here 
you don t 
you almost sound
as if you believe that 
i committed no murder 
you must be disappointed 
you committed fraud 
you re in trouble 
i can get you out of here 
do you have any idea
what it took to get in here 
you ve gone as far as you can go 
come with me now 
there is still a few million
miles left to go 
it s over 
is that the only way you can succeed
is to see me fail 
god  even you are gonna tell me
what i can and can t do now 
in case you haven t noticed 
i don t need any rescuing 
but you did once 
well  you ve got all the answers 
how do you explain that 
you didn t beat me that day 
i beat myself 
who are you trying to convince 
do you want me
to prove it to you 
it s not important  anton 
it s forgotten 
do you want me to prove it to you 
i ll prove it to you  
i do 
where s the shore 
  you wanna quit 
  we re too far out 
how are you doing this 
how have you done any of this 
  we have to go back 
  it s too late for that 
we re closer to the other side 
what other side 
you wanna drown us both 
you wanna know how i did it 
this is how i did it  anton  i never
saved anything for the swim back 
you couldn t see  could you 
that night  crossing the street 
you crossed anyway 
if you re still interested   
let me know 
sorry 
the wind caught it 
you re flying today  aren t you 
look at what a mess you re in 
come on 
i have your samples ready 
i don t need any samples
where i m going 
you might when you get back 
everything you need
to last you two lifetimes 
why have you done all this 
so jerome will always be here
when you need him 
  where are you going 
  i m traveling too 
i don t know how to thank you 
i got the better end of the deal 
i only lent you my body 
you lent me your dream 
not until you re upstairs 
what is this 
new policy 
flight got you nervous 
well  there s a problem  lamar 
i never told you about my son  did l 
he s a big fan of yours 
just remember   
that i was as good as any
and better than most 
he wants to apply here 
i could ve gone up and back 
and nobody would ve been the wiser 
unfortunately  my son s
not all that they promised 
but then  who knows
what he could do 
right 
for future reference   
right handed men
don  t hold it with their left 
just one of those things 
you re gonna miss your flight  vincent 
for someone who was never
meant for this world   
i must confess i m suddenly
