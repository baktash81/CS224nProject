friends in my life who truly mattered 
two of them were killers who
never made it past the age of thirty 
the other is a non practicing attorney
living with the pain of his past   
   too afraid to let it go 
never confronting its horror 
i m the only one who could speak for
them   and the children we were 
my three friends and
i were inseparable   
   happy and content to live in the
closed world of hell s kitchen 
the west side streets of manhattan
were our private playground   
   a cement kingdom where we felt we
were nothing less than absolute rulers 
hell s kitchen was populated
by an uneasy blend of   
irish  italian  puerto rican 
and eastern european laborers 
hard men living hard lives 
we lived in railroad apartments
inside red brick tenements 
few mothers worked and all had
trouble with the men they married 
i buried one fucking wife 
i could bury another one 
domestic violence was a cottage
industry in hell s kitchen 
yet  there was no divorce
and few separations 
the will of the church was forceful 
for a marriage to end 
someone usually had to die 
yet  despite the harshness of life   
   hell s kitchen offered the kids
on its streets a safety net   
   enjoyed by few other neighborhoods 
crimes against people of the
neighborhood were not permitted 
when they did occur  the punishment
doled out was severe   
   and  in some cases  final 
a drug dealer from uptown
moved heroin into hell s kitchen 
a packet killed the twelve year old
son of a puerto rican numbers runner 
it was the last packet
the dealer ever sold 
hell s kitchen was a place of
innocence   ruled by corruption 
my friends and i spent lots of time
inside holy angels 
we each served as altar boys 
everyone wanted to work
funeral masses 
since the funeral included a  3 fee   
   and more if you looked
sufficiently somber 
there was an active competition
between the four of us   
   to come up with the best
and boldest prank 
two weeks into the new school year 
i found the nun s clacker in
the school hallway   
   and i was ready for the big leagues 
in church  it was used to alert
the girls as to when   
   they should stand  sit 
kneel and genuflect   
   all based on the number of
times the clacker was pressed 
in my pocket  it was cause for havoc 
you will be defenders of the faith 
you will be soldiers of christ 
and you will receive the gifts   
   of the holy spirit 
it s gonna be a great day and your   
   parents will be proud of you 
when you were baptized   
   godparents made promises for you 
and now   
 you re gonna confirm those promises 
 let me have the clacker 
what clacker 
now 
let everyone rise 
let us pray 
nuns are such easy targets 
john and i spent more time in
church than the others 
we were the only two in the group to give
any thought of entering the priesthood 
and john and i were intrigued by
the powers the priest was given 
a secret world of betrayal
and deceit  where people   
   openly admitted dark misdeeds
and vile indiscretions 
confession was better than any
book we could get our hands on 
or any movie we could see 
because the sins were real   
   committed by people we knew 
the temptation to be part of that
was far too great to resist 
if we get caught  they ll burn us 
what if our mothers are out there 
what if we end up hearing
their confessions 
what if we hear something worse 
like what 
like a murder  what if
somebody cops to a murder 
relax  all we ve got to do is sit back 
listen and remember not to laugh 
seconds later 
our booth comes to life 
i   sleep with married men 
men with families 
in the morning  i tell myself
it s the last time  but it never is 
yes 
you see  i m   i m pregnant 
the father 
take a number 
what are you going to do 
i know what you want me to do 
and i know what i should do 
i just don t know what i m gonna do 
look  i gotta go 
thanks for listening  fellas 
i really appreciate it 
i know you ll keep it to yourselves 
she knew 
yeah  she knew 
why do you think she told us all that 
i don t know  i guess
she had to tell somebody 
father robert carrillo was
a longshoreman s son   
   who was as comfortable sitting on
a bar stool in a back alley saloon   
   as he was standing at the altar
during high mass 
he had toyed with a life of petty
crime before finding his calling 
he was a friend   a friend who
just happened to be a priest 
you know what crap like
that does to your body 
come on  father  it beats smoking 
and it s cheaper  too 
maybe 
so  what do you hear  anything 
no  nothing 
i hear you re interested
in becoming a priest 
who says 
word is you want to get the
feel of a confessional booth 
i don t know what you re
talking about  father 
you don t 
maybe i got the wrong information 
i guess you did 
i ll see you later tonight 
what s tonight 
i gotta drop some books
and magazines off   
   for the elderly and disabled
around the neighborhood 
your mother said you d love to help 
i bet she did 
shakes   l don t want you
getting into any trouble 
come on  father  you know i never do 
that s all i wish for
you and your friends 
that s it 
that s it  nothing else 
i swear  that s it 
you know  a priest shouldn t swear 
and kids shouldn t be listening
to other people s confessions 
i ll see you tonight 
all right   see you 
michael was the most sexually
experienced of our group 
which meant that he kissed a girl
on more than one occasion 
but his real love was carol martinez 
hell s kitchen s half breed 
half puerto rican  half irish 
she was raised by her father 
her mother having died at childbirth 
carol stayed pretty much to herself but
was always comfortable in our company 
we could always count on carol   
   to stand sentry on the first night
of the ice capades 
while crowds of families lined
the front of the garden   
   waiting to see the skaters perform   
   we each had one eye in a hole   
   watching two dozen beautiful
and nearly naked women   
   get into their skaters  outfits 
this is what heaven must be about 
carol  you want to take a look 
like it s something i haven t seen 
you re so lucky 
she s so beautiful  my god  i could
die now and i wouldn t be sad 
when my friends and i were young 
   hell s kitchen was run
by a man named king benny 
when he was young  king benny
was a hit man for lucky luciano 
lucky luciano did a lot of good for
this country during world war ll 
but you ain t gonna read about
that in any fucking history book 
there was talk king benny was
the shooter of  mad dog coll    
   that prick on west 23rd street 
he ran bootleg with  dutch  schultz 
and he opened up a couple of clubs
with  tough tony  anastasia 
i was 14 when i first heard
about him  the story goes 
as a kid  he wasn t much of anything 
he was always getting the shit
kicked out of him in street fights 
and then one day  and who the
fuck knows why  some irish guy   
   about 25 years old 
he takes king benny   
   and he flings him down
a flight of stairs 
king benny breaks all
his teeth in the front 
you know what king benny does 
he waits  he waits 8 years   
   to get even with that prick 
he walks into a public bath house 
the guy s soaking in the tub 
king benny takes out his front teeth 
he lays them down on the sink 
then he looks over at
the guy and says 
 when i look in the mirror 
i see your face  
then he pulls out a gun   
   and he shoots the guy twice
in each leg 
then he says to the guy 
 now  when you take
a bath  you see mine  
no one ever fucked with
king benny after that 
revenge 
revenge 
can i talk to you for a minute 
i d like to work for you 
help you out  whatever you need 
you re the butcher s kid   am i right 
what kind of a job are you looking for 
whatever  it doesn t matter 
it doesn t matter

place to come for jobs

i m always here 
my first job for king benny
paid  25 a week and   
   ate up only 40 minutes of my time 
in the dark club room  one of the guys
would hand me a crumpled paper bag   
   and direct me to one of the two
local police precincts for delivery 
it was a perfect way
to handle payouts 
come on  let s go  right here 
let s see what kind of cash
you ve got in that bag 
you gotta be nuts  do you

yeah  we know  and

father bobby knew we worked for
king benny  and he wasn t pleased 
he wasn t worried about the
pocket money  but the next step   
   when they ask you to pick up a gun 
he didn t want that to happen to us 
you think running for king
benny is a good idea 
it pays 
a lot of things pay 
not like this 
most priests liked to
preach from the pulpit 
father bobby liked to talk during the
bump and shove of a pick up game 
good shot 
i found an art class for you to take 
you know i can t afford
to take any art classes 
you don t have to pay anything 
the teacher s a friend of mine 
it could be nothing but
a waste of time  father 
maybe  or it could be the first step 
first step to what 
doing something with your life 
you never know  it may
help you get out of here 
you all can get out of here 
guys  are we gonna talk
or play basketball 
listen  i got a story
i want to tell you 
it ain t the one about the lepers  is it 
cause that one gave me nightmares 
no lepers  michelangelo 
he was born poor  just like you guys 
he was a painter  he was a sculptor 
he takes this job from the pope 
good money  good work 
okay  father  but why d
the pope call him 
because the pope was looking for
the best guy he could find   
   to paint the ceiling
of his church in rome 
it don t sound like
that big a job  father 
well  for michelangelo it was 
michelangelo needed the job   
   because it paid more money
than he ever had in his life 
and that way  he could pay off the loan
sharks that were chasing his father down 
what s his father 
he was like a low level   con guy 
conned people out of money 
goats  sheep   
goats 
chickens  whatever he could  you know 
 chickens 
 chickens 
you know what happened 
he painted a ceiling no
one will ever forget 
painted it like he was touched
by the hand of god 
did he pay off the loans 
every single one of them 
how long did it take him 
painting the ceiling and all 
it took him about 9 years 
9 years  
that s a big ceiling 
i had a puerto rican do my
whole apartment in two days 
and he had a bum leg 
you know  i don t know what
i m gonna do with you guys 
hey  just give us a job painting 
and leave the rest to us 
you know what it was 
the sistine chapel 
sixteenth chapel 
who painted the other fifteen 
outside events meant little  in a society
changing radically by the hour   
   we watched the images scatter
nightly across the t v  screens 
young protesters spoke about how they
were going to change our lives   
   and fix the world  but while
they shouted their slogans   
   my friends and i went to
funeral services   
   for the young men
of hell s kitchen   
   who came back from vietnam
in body bags 
we viewed with skepticism
the faces on television   
   those protected by money and
upper middle class standing 
a growing army of feminists
marched across the country   
   demanding equality 
yet  our mothers still cooked   
   and cared for men who abused
them mentally and physically 
for me and my friends  these
developments carried no weight 
they might as well have occurred in
another country   in another century 
our attention was elsewhere 
we sat with father bobby in a third
floor hospital ward  visiting john   
   hoping he d recover from
a punctured lung 
a gift from one of his mother s
over zealous boyfriends 
i hope you like these 
you better not tell me you don t 
father bobby didn t let
that situation rest 
i gave on sunday 
i m in a rush  okay 
john reilly 
the little punk 
he got out of line  so i put him
back in line  no big deal 
you put him in the hospital 
he s alive  ain t he  look  if he s
smart  he learned himself a lesson 
what are you  about 220  230 
you re a big guy  how much
you think john reilly weighs 
80  85 
that s not even a featherweight 
if this were a fight  you d
be way out of your division 
look  it was a slap  it was nothing 
well  next time you ll be meeting me 
and i may not be in your division  but
i do weigh more than 85 pounds 
and you won t need a doctor when
i m done  you ll need a priest   
   to pray over your body 
see you in church 
father bobby would ve
made a good hit man 
it s a shame we lost
him to the other side 
we were down 7 6 in the last inning
of a sewer to sewer stickball game   
   against hector maldonado   
and three of his friends 
come on  davy   take this chump out

come on  davy

you can take him  mikey 
yeah  i told you he wasn t shit  baby 
hey  swallow your tongue 
you little gimp bitch 
you could ve helped her
across the street   
   or you could ve bought her
an ice cream 
you didn t have to throw the game 
yeah  and now we re
the salvation army 
you ever wonder why there
ain t a salvation navy 
game over  losers 
cough up the cash  a buck each 
he s no better than you 
he was today 
no  you let him be 
all because irish  here  has a thing
for little girls with no legs 
look  stay away from this 
fat man  all right 
you boys are soft like bread 
it s going to catch up to you 
and when it does  it s
going to hurt   bad 
what happens is our business 
not yours  okay 
you gotta stay tough to be tough 
guy smells it when you re weak 
eat you like a salad 
do you see that street 
that street is the dish of life 
and you boys are appetizers 
somebody gonna come along  eat you
up and forget about you by dessert 
take it easy  fat man 
it was just stickball 
yeah  but going soft is a habit 
you have to keep yourself mean
and cut your life around it 
all right  all right  calm down 
it s like hanging out with fucking
confucius over here 
be funny  limp dick 
look  this is just free advice
from me to you 
you take it or you throw it away 
it don t matter 
thanks a lot  fat man 
in truth  we were all surprised
by michael s actions 
but in his mind 
losing that game meant   
   handing a feeling of victory
to a girl in a wheelchair   
   was more than the right thing to do 
come on  let s go swimming 
the temperature topped out
at 98 degrees   
   on the day our lives
were forever altered 
i m frying like an egg up here 
i say  we get some buttered rolls 
a couple of cold sodas  and head
down to the docks 
can t you feel the breeze up here 
what breeze 
we re surrounded by a wall  genius 
the devil couldn t stand this heat 
will you guys shut up  please 
i m trying to get my burn 
it s 98 degrees 
 there s some breeze up here 
 it s a hot breeze 
we haven t hit the hot dog
vendor in a couple of weeks 
i don t know  mikey  that cart guy
ain t like the others 
i mean  he gets pretty pissed  like
crazy when you try to take him off 
we can eat hot dogs   
or we can eat air   choose 
air is probably safer  mike 
yeah  a hot dog ain t worth
bleeding over  mikey 
yeah  anyway  whose turn is it 
yours 
 yeah  it s yours 
 mine  it s not my turn 
 yes  it is 
 i went like last month 
 he went two weeks 
 you never went 
 last month 
 are you nuts  i went right after him 
i m not going 
 why 
 it s too hot 
if i walk down the
stairs  i ll pass out 
mustard and onions  no soda 
i know you 
i look like a lot of people 
the scam was simple 
i was to walk up to the hot dog
vendor and order what i wanted 
the vendor would then hand me my hot
dog and watch as i ran off without paying 
this left the vendor with two
choices  neither very appealing 
he could stand his ground and swallow
his loss  or he could give chase 
the second forces him
to abandon the cart   
   where my friends could
feast in his absence 
i m gonna need two napkins 
pay my money  thief 
wow  ketchup 
i took it from him and ran 
i scooted past tommy mug s dry
cleaners and armond s shoe repair 
the vendor gave chase  a wooden 
handled  pronged fork in one hand 
you gonna give me two 
you know  these things are
heavier than they look 
genius  it s the gas tanks
to keep the food hot 
they re heavier than shit 
think we can push it  the three of us 
push it where 
a couple of blocks  it ll be
a nice surprise for the guy   
   when he comes back from chasing
shakes  not to find his cart 
the vendor tired at 47th and 9th 
i was on the other side of the street 
he was beat   but not beaten 
he could go ten minutes
more  just on hate alone 
give it up 
what s wrong  mikey 
shakes is taking too long 
he should ve been back by now 
he ll be fine  he s shakes 
you guys were supposed to take
the hot dogs  not the wagon 
 now he tells us 
 he s coming fast  mikey 
he still near 
i got a plan  come on
over by the subway 
the plan was as simple and as dumb
as anything we had ever done 
we were to hold the cart on the top
edge of the stairwell 
leaning it downward 
and wait for the vendor 
we were to let it go the second
he grabbed the handles 
then we d leave the scene as he struggled
to ease the cart back onto the sidewalk 
to this day  i don t
know why we did it 
but  we would all pay a price 
it only took a minute   but
in that minute   everything changed 
guys  i can t hold it 
 don t let go 
 i can t hold it 
i can t hold it 
stop  god  no   
damn 
sweet jesus  what have you boys done 
what in the name of god
have you boys done 
i think we just killed a man 
while james caldwell was slowly
recovering at st  clare s hospital   
   we were charged and remanded
into our parents  custody 
i m sorry  dad 
 sorry  ain t gonna do you much good 
take it easy 
this is no time to get crazy 
you re going to jail and you don t
even know what the fuck that means 
ma  come look  ma 
i don t know  bastard 
he s just a kid 
he shouldn t have to do time 
nobody in this family should have to do
time  i done enough time for everybody 
i hear you re short an altar boy 
you still remember what to do 
easy on the water 
heavy on the wine 
and ring the bells whenever
i see someone start to nod off 
get ready   we got 5 minutes
till show time 
i m gonna miss this 
i m gonna miss all of this 
i ve been doing all i can  but so
far every door i touch is locked 
i could run   we all could run 
disappear for a while 
nobody s gonna come looking 
nobody s gonna care about us   
about where we go 
you run now  you re gonna
run till you die 
hiding s not gonna make it go away 
people aren t gonna forget 
you ve gotta face this 
i can t  father 
i don t want to face it 
i m too scared to face it 
i m scared  too 
nobody s more scared than i am 
but you gotta do it 
you re gonna be okay  you re
gonna make it through there 
you understand 
come on  we got an audience 
i counted three rummies and
four widows on my way in 
plus fat ralphie sleeping
one off in the last row 
it s the rain  bad weather
always brings in the crowds 
this is one of my favorites 
what is 
 whatever you do to the least of
my brethren   you do to me  
come on 
we never saw the vendor as a man   
   not the way we saw other
men of the neighborhood 
and we didn t care enough about
him to grant him any respect 
we gave little notice to how hard
he worked  or that he had a wife   
   and two kids in greece and hoped
to bring them to this country 
we didn t pay attention to
the long hours he worked 
we didn t see any of that 
we only saw a free lunch

   housed in 5 separate units 
from the outside  the facility

   wanted it to resemble   
   some kind of nice
school or university 
michael  tommy  john and i were
assigned to the 2nd floor of group c 
we each had a private 12 ft room 
i d been in my room less than an hour

or how strong you can be

that i was neither tough nor strong

styler was using his job at wilkinson s
to finance his way through law school 
addison was a graduate of
a local high school

it was not a group of innocent
young boys at wilkinson

i don t understand you boys 
i don t think you know what
it means to have rules 
you gotta have rules 
and you gotta have discipline 
i don t know what it was like in your
homes and your home lives  but   
   in my house with my father 
there were rules 
and if you didn t follow the
rules  there was hell to pay 
you had rules  and you had discipline 
sometimes  it wasn t nice  but
we learned  we sure did learn 
right around there to the right 
there you go 
i mean  it s a simple thing  really 
you got rules  and you got discipline 
that s the beginning of the story 
and that s the end of the story 
we understand each other 
turn and face the wall 
now  we got interrupted earlier
in the lunch room  but   
   there s no one
to interrupt us here now 
what do you want 
a blow job 
down on your knees 
face the wall 
there are no clear pictures of
the sexual abuse we endured 
i buried it as deep as
it could possibly go 
what i remember most clearly
from that chilly october night   
   was that it was
my fourteenth birthday   
   and the end of my childhood 
early in my stay  i d written and
asked my father not to come 
i couldn t look at my father
and have him see on my face   
   all that had happened to me 
michael had done the same with the
interested members of his family 
tommy s mother couldn t get
it together to visit 
john s mother came up once a month 
but no one could stop father
bobby from visiting 
so listen  let s try to keep
this on a happy note  okay 
nokes warned us not to say
anything to father bobby 
if we did  reprisals would be severe 
you lost a few pounds 
it s not exactly home cooking 
sit down 
this is where i get to see
all four of you guys today 
i loved father bobby  but i
couldn t stand to look at him 
i was afraid he d look
right through me   
   past the fear and shame 
right through to the truth 
shakes  is there anything
you want to tell me 
anything at all 
you shouldn t come here anymore  father 
i appreciate it and all  but   
   l don t think it s the
right thing for you to do 
i stopped off at attica today on my
way up here to see an old friend 
you have any friends not in jail 
not as many as i would like 
what s he in for 
triple murder  he killed three
men about fifteen years ago 
and he s a good friend 
he s my best friend 
we hung out together 
we were close   
just like you and the guys 
we were both sent up here 
that s right  and it wasn t easy   
   just like it s not easy
for you and the guys 
this place killed him   
made him not care anymore 
don t let this place do
that to you  shakes 
don t let it make you think
you re tougher than you are 
i ve got to go  father 
i ll see you in the kitchen 
i m counting on you 
wipe the tears off your face 
don t let them see it 
don t let them see you crying 
don t give them the satisfaction 
you ll be out of here
before you know it 
you re gonna be okay 
i didn t want to let him go 
i never felt as close to anyone
as i felt to him at that moment 
a number of the inmates  as tough as
they acted during the day   
   would often cry themselves
to sleep at night 
there were other cries  too 
these differed from those
filled with fear and loneliness 
they were lower and muffled 
the sounds of pained anguish 
those cries can change
the course of a life 
they are cries that  once heard 
can never be erased from memory 
on this one night  those cries
belonged to my friend  john   
   when ralph ferguson
paid him a visit 
i was expecting to read 30
book reports over the weekend 
there are only 6 for me to read   
which means i m missing how many 
this is english class 
math is down the hall 
i want to help you 
you may not believe that 
or you may not care  but it s the truth 
 you got a second 
 what  i do something wrong 
no  you did a great
job on your book report 
you really seemed to like the book 
 the count of monte cristo  
it s my favorite 
i like it more since i ve been here 
why is that 
it s like   he wouldn t let
anyone beat him  the count 
took what he had to take 
beatings  insults and whatever 
and he learned from it 
then when the time came for him to
do something  he made his move 
 you admire that 
 no  i respect that 
you got a copy of the book at home 
i got the classics illustrated comic 
no  it s not the same thing 
listen  i gotta go 
i m gonna miss morning roll call 
i ve got something for you 
i thought you might like to have it 
are you serious 
well  you love the book that much 
you should have a copy of your own 
 i can t pay you 
 it s a gift 
you ve gotten gifts before 
haven t you 
it s been a while 
 well  it s my way of saying  thanks 
 for what 
that somebody listens   
even if it s just one student 
you re a good teacher  mr  carlson 
listen  we can discuss the book
on friday in class if you   
   think the count can
hold their attention 
he s got a shot 
any particular section
i should read from 
that s easy   the part where
he escapes from prison 
there you go  all star 
here s your locker room 
it was only a game   just a touch
football game  nothing more 
but a game i wish we
had never played 
guards against inmates 
the guards practiced four times a week 
our team was picked the
monday before the game 
we had a 2 hour practice 
it didn t matter much 
we weren t supposed to win 
we were just supposed to show up 
who s the toughest guy here 
how do you mean  tough 
who can talk and have
everyone listening 
rizzo  black kid over there 
michael saw an opening   a chance
to bring the game to our level 
even out the field  but he needed help 
he needed rizzo 
black kid with an italian name 
with him on our side  we had a chance 
look  white boy  i don t know
what you play in the streets 
i don t care  but in here 
the guards call the play   
   and the play calls for
them to win the game 
why 
look man   
   guards stay clear of me  all right 
they stay back and let me do my time 
if i play that game and i
put a hurt on one of them   
   they just might change my cushion 
i m not saying we gotta win 
i just don t want to take a beating 
you do every day 
 why is saturday special 
  cause on saturday  we can hit back 
they don t fuck with you like they do us 
but they fuck with you another way 
you re just an animal to them 
 i don t give a fuck 
 yeah  you do 
and beating them on saturday
is not gonna change a thing 
then why  white boy  why 
to make them feel what we feel
   just for a couple of hours 
now  don t try anything funny  sambo 
nobody will get hurt 
you know what i m saying 
i call heads 
he called heads 
it is a head 
let s go 
you re gonna die  mother fucker 
you re gonna fucking die 
none of you motherfuckers can cover me 
we got ourselves a game 
i m feeling good today 
this shit feels good 
fuck 
get the fuck off me 
yeah  keep smiling  you little piss ant 
for 90 minutes  we took
the game out of the prison   
   moved it miles beyond
the locked gates   
   and the sloping hills of
the surrounding countryside   
   and brought it back down to the streets
of the neighborhoods we d come from 
for those 90 minutes 
we were once again free 
rizzo  rizzo 
rizzo   rizzo 
hey  nokes 
good game 
for once  we had a victory 
but it didn t last 
it couldn t last   
and all i wanted to do was die 
i was not alone in the hole  i knew my
friends were down in the depths with me 
each in his own cell  each in his own
pain   suffering his own demons 
rizzo was there  too 
i had lost any sense of time 
i thought you d never wake up 
i thought i d never want to 
john and tommy  they re
on the other side there 
how are they 
they re alive 
who isn t 
rizzo 
they killed him 
they took turns beating him until
there was nothing of that kid to beat 
rizzo was dead because of us 
we made him think that going
up against the guards   
   in a meaningless football game   
   had some value   that it would
give us a reason to go on 
once again  we were wrong 
did they give you
your release date yet 
nokes had a letter from the warden 
waved it in front of me 
then tore it up    
when do you figure 
end of spring  early
summer or something 
i wish we were coming with you 
it would ve been nice for all
of us to walk out together 
no use thinking about that  we re
gonna do a full year  not an hour less 
when i get out  i could get father
bobby to make a couple of phone calls 
shave a month or two off 
 there s nothing to talk about 
 there s a lot to talk about 
maybe  if people knew what was going
on in here  they d make a move 
i don t want anybody to know 
not father bobby  king benny 
fat mancho   
   not my mother  nobody 
i don t either 
i mean  i wouldn t know what
to say to anyone who did know 
i can t think of anybody
who needs to hear about it 
either they won t believe it 
or they won t give a shit 
yeah  i don t even think we should
talk about it once it s over 
we got no choice but to live with it 
and talking makes living it harder 
so  we might as well
not even talk about it 
the truth stays with us 
i want to be able to sleep one night   
   and not have to worry who s coming
in my room  what s gonna happen to me 
if i can get that  then i ll be happy 
someday  john  i promise 
i was in my last hours as an inmate
at the wilkinson home for boys 
i was given four copies
of my release form 
the final reminder of my
time at wilkinson 
i never heard the key
turn in the lock   
   and i never heard
the snap of the bolt 
you should be asleep 
i just wanted to say goodbye 
we all do 
i told him  i told him right
to his face  i said 
i don t care if you re paying me
overtime or not 
i m not working those kind of hours 
yeah  did you put in for it 
i put in for it 
because i put in for it 
they don t give it to me 
i come in early for three days 
do they give me overtime  no 
a part of all of us was
left there that night 
that night will never be
removed from my mind 
the night of june 1  1968  
the summer of love 
my last night at the
wilkinson home for boys 
at 8 25 p m  two men
walked through the doors 
the bartender knew their faces as most
of the neighborhood knew their names 
they were two of the founding
members of the west side boys 
they were also its deadliest 
the blond haired man had been in and out
of jail since he was a teenager 
he robbed and killed
at will or on command 
he was presently a suspect in
four unsolved homicides 
he was an alcoholic and a cocaine abuser
with a fast temper and a faster trigger 
he once shot a mechanic dead for
moving ahead of him in a movie line 
the dark haired man was equally deadly   
   and had committed his
first murder at the age of 17 
in return  he was paid  50 
he drank  and he did drugs   
   and he had a wife he never saw 
living somewhere in queens 
he s making a noble attempt
to really change things 
 the republicans will take the house 
 well  we got a lot of work to do 
it s gonna take more
than 4 years to get    
they ll take it at
the mid term elections 
he s got the charisma 
he s gonna do it 
he s our man  reagan s
the man who s gonna do it 
hey  jerry   
what are they talking about 
they re talking about reagan s speech 
order those two men some
drinks and put it on my tab 
you tell them that republicans
are not welcome in hell s kitchen   
   and either a political conversion or
a change of conversation is in order 
sure thing 
the gentlemen there would like to
buy you a drink on one condition 
you know the rules 
no religion  no politics 
you get my meaning 
order something for me 
i gotta go to the bathroom 
can i help you with something  chief 
not right now 
enjoy the rest of your meal 
i ordered brisket on a roll 
with fries and   
   two baskets of soda bread 
i know how you like that shit 
is that okay by you 
take a look at the guy at the table 
take a good look 
motherfucker 
that s him 
are you fucking kidding me 
bingo 
this is amazing 
hello   it s been a long time 
who the fuck are you guys 
who the fuck asked you to sit down 
i thought you d be happy to see us 
i guess i was wrong 
you know  i thought
you d do a lot better 
you know  with all that training   
all that time you put in   
   just to end up watching
someone else s money 
that seems like a waste 
i m asking you now for the last
time  what the fuck do you want 
why don t you take your time 
it ll come to you 
i can see how he might forget us 
you know  we were just something for
you and your friends to play with 
it s a little harder for us to forget 
you gave us so much more to remember 
you can t quite place us 
can you  chief 
let me help you out  you re looking
at john reilly and tommy marcano 
yeah  that s right 
that was a long time ago 
so how you been 
yeah  we ain t kids now 
so  what do you want 
what i ve always wanted
is to watch you die 
you ordered the meat loaf 
the brisket s really good here 
only you ll never know it 
you fucked up 
yeah  you were scared little pricks 
both of you 
all of you   scared shitless 
but l   
   l tried to make you tough 
i tried to make you hard 
i had you all wrong then  nokes 
all this time i thought you just liked   
   fucking and beating up little boys 
you two motherfuckers
are gonna burn in hell 
you re gonna burn in hell 
yeah  after you 
did that hurt  nokes 
jerry  sorry  should ve made
those brisket sandwiches to go 
john reilly  how do you plead 
not guilty  your honor 
thomas marcano 
not guilty  your honor 
john reilly and thomas marcano 
you are hereby held without bail 
in all the years since wilkinson s  we
had never once spoken to each other   
   about what happened there 
we remained caring friends   
   but the relationship
had been altered 
we drifted together  always wondering
if that moment would arrive   
   that would force us to
deal with the past 
one down  shakes  one down 
one what 
one sean nokes 
nokes 
at the time of nokes  shooting 
michael was working as an
assistant new york district attorney 
i got a call that he wanted to meet me
on 45th street in queens 
then  he hung up 
 so  what did they say 
 what 
john and tommy  what d they say 
it s a little cloak and
dagger  isn t it  mike 
nokes 
did they talk about him 
 john did 
 yeah 
what did he say 
he said   one down  shakes 
one down  
i hear they hired danny snyder
as the lawyer  is that right 
it s temporary  king benny s
gonna move in one of his lawyers 
don t let him do that 
snyder s perfect 
 perfect  the guy s a fall down drunk 
 then he is perfect 
perfect for what 
are you covering this
story for your newspaper 
 me 
 yeah 
i m a timetable clerk  mikey  ask me
what movie s playing at what time 
i m lucky they let me in the building 
get some coffee 
let s take a walk 
i m gonna prosecute john
and tommy in an open court 
what  are you fucking nuts 
just hear me out 
you should stay home tomorrow 
call in sick and save your life  counsel 
i m not taking this case to win 
i m taking this case to lose 
what does that mean 
it means it s payback time 
look  john and tommy started this 
it s begun 
it s messy  it s not how i had
it planned but   here it is 
and you and l  we can finish it 
finish what  mikey 
you read  the count of
monte cristo  lately 
i don t know   ten years ago 
you see  i read a little
bit of it every night 
i read words like  revenge  
sweet  lasting revenge 
payback time 
it s our time 
what are you saying  mike 
i m saying it s time for
all of us to get a taste 
i m saying it s time
to put an end to this 
let s walk 
so  i asked for the case 
i told them i was from the same
neighborhood as the accused   
   knew the mentality of the area 
blah  blah  blah   
they bought it 
and the connection between
john  tommy and nokes 
what connection  all juvenile records
are destroyed after seven years 
we were never at wilkinson s 
we gotta go after the guards 
i gotta get wilkinson s 
bring it all down 
adam styler  plain clothes cop 
works narcotics in queens 
known to shake down dealers for dope
and cash  he s got a cocaine problem 
other personal information there 
henry addison now works for the mayor 
if you can fucking believe that 
he s a community outreach
director in brooklyn 
his sexual habits haven t changed 
he still likes sex with young boys 
ralph ferguson works in a social
service agency in long island 
how long have you been
working on this  mike 
he s recently divorced  got
one child  and on weekends   
   teaches catholic sunday school 
well  he seems clean then  right 
that s exactly why i
want the piece of shit 
the plan is to call ferguson
in as a character witness 
get him talking about his
best friend  sean nokes 
once i got him on the stand  i m
gonna open the door to wilkinson s 
mike  are you sure you
want to go this way 
i mean  we buried this a long time ago 
do you still sleep with the light on 
john and tommy  do you want them
to know anything about this 
no  it ll play better in
court if they don t know 
the  not guilty  verdict had to be a
verdict that no one would dare question 
danny snyder was to remain as
tommy and john s attorney 
michael s plan relied heavily
on hell s kitchen   
   to deliver information and keep quiet 
both were skills the neighborhood
had in abundance 
we d set up a simple
method of communication 
if michael was sending 
messages were left at work   
   for me to call my non existent
girlfriend   gloria  
if i needed to get word to michael  i d
have someone from the neighborhood   
   pick up an early edition
of the new york times   
   write the word  edmund  in the upper
right hand corner of the metro section   
   and drop it in front
of michael s apartment 
for this plan to succeed   
   we needed total secrecy of
the only people we completely trusted 
the plan depended on
keeping michael alive   
   which meant that word had to get
to john and tommy s killing crew   
   that he was not an open target 
after this night  michael would
not be available to any of us 
the only time we would see
him would be in court 
 that s it 
 not quite 
we ve got four witnesses who saw the
shooting and are willing to testify 
gotta get that number down 
 i ll talk to king benny 
 good 
i can handle two  but   
you gotta get us one for our side 
 one of what 
 one witness 
a witness who ll put john   tommy
elsewhere on the night of the murder 
a witness they can t touch 
don t they have a name for that 
a judge would call it perjury 
and what are we calling it 
a favor 
get up 
 tony 
 yeah  king 
bring danny snyder to see me 
who  danny snyder  the lawyer 
you know more than one danny snyder 
bring me the one you know 
i can t do this now  you gotta know that 
it s been a long time for me 
you need somebody younger  you know 
somebody like i used to be 
younger is not better 
doesn t have experience  doesn t
know its way around a courthouse 
yeah  i m lucky i can
find the courthouse 
i had only four cases last year 
you know how many i won 
none  that s how many  none 
in two of them  i think the   
   the jury blamed me personally 
they must ve been innocent 
it s tough to get
innocent men off a rap 
i wasn t even planning on
going to court with this one 
i was just gonna plea it down
best i could and walk away 
i wasn t planning on
taking this to trial  sir 
well  your plans have been changed 
well  i am afraid that i ll make a
mistake and say the wrong thing   
   make a wrong turn somewhere 
and you don t want to take that risk 
life is risk 
i m sorry 
life is risk 
life is a risk 
i haven t been in here before 
what do you need me to do 
you re gonna be given the
answers and the questions 
all you have to do is read 
you can read  can t you 
is it in english 
just don t drift  don t drink 
and don t lose 
what if i do lose 
then you ll go down for the dirt nap 
never heard that expression before 
dirt nap 
i m not really cut out for this anymore 
i mean  a guy gets hit by a bus   
   and sues  i like that 
some lady slips in a supermarket   
i m with her 
the discussion is over 
i m an alcoholic  this is a murder case 
this isn t for me 
it was once 
before you let the drink lead 
be sober by tomorrow 
and don t look so worried  snyder 
you ve got nothing to lose   
just like the rest of us 
i don t want to be a burden
to you  but l   
   along with my alcohol problem 
i have a slight drug problem 
i mean  nothing big 
go away 
within days of michael taking the case   
   the west side boys got a visit
from king benny 
the king requested that the verbal abuse
directed towards michael continue 
 traitor  and  gutter rat  were
heard up and down the avenue 
but there was never to be
a death move against him 
the hit on michael sullivan  if there was
one  could only come from king benny 
the underground word   
the only one that mattered   
   had spread through the streets with
the speed of a late night bullet 
king benny s sleepers
were making their play 
 sleepers  was a street name for anyone
who spent time in a juvenile facility 
you gonna pay for that 
you little prick 
need your help  fat man 
need a big favor 
i ll be outside 
king benny been to see you 
oh  my goodness 
what a fucking thing we put together 
you have a drunk lawyer on one side 
a kid lawyer on the other 
fucking paper boy 
making like dick tracy 
there are four sets of eyeballs
that saw the whole thing 
meanwhile  the two on trial
kill more people than cancer 
fucking general custer has
a better shot at a walk 
there s no connection
with the guard and us 
the cops think it s a
drug related homicide 
it s just we need you to
pull a few strings  fat man 
you know  if you get caught on this 
you re looking straight at serious 
i m talking real jail 
the big house    
they are not good boys any more 
they re killers now 
cold as stone 
i know 
i know what they were  and i know
what they are  and it s not about that 
it s not worth it  throwing
away life just to get even 
you and the lawyer have
a chance to get out 
to get out the right way 
there s no choice   not for us 
on occasion  i d have
dinner with carol 
she still lived in the neighborhood and
was a social worker in the south bronx 
her concern for us was undiminished
by the passing years 
whenever we went out as a group  carol
would walk between michael and john   
   grasping their arms   
   in step between the lawyer
and the killer 
mug me or marry me  shakes 
i m too tired for anything else 
would you settle for a
couple of beers  carol 
if that s your best offer 
i ll throw in a hug and a kiss 
deal 
you look tired 
thank you 
they don t give you time to
sleep on this new job of yours 
so  how much do you know 
just what the neighborhood says 
and what i read in papers like yours 
what does the neighborhood say 
that they re gonna put
johnny and tommy away 
that their best friend s
gonna be the one to do it 
you believe that 
it s hard not to  shakes 
unless we all have it wrong 
he did take the fucking case 
 he did take the case 
 what else is there to say 
you know michael very well   
   maybe even better than i do 
yeah  i thought i did 
now  i don t know 
 you do know 
 i don t know 
he went in there  and
he asked for the case 
now  you tell me  what the
hell kind of friend is that 
the best kind 
the kind who ll throw away
everything to help his friends 
what are you telling me  shakes 
you know this neighborhood  carol 
everything s a shakedown or a scam 
why should this be any different 
i m hungry 
i m gonna get something to eat 
there s this point in michael
that you can t go beyond 
i mean  you can try  i tried 
and he just   he shut down 
couldn t touch him   
couldn t even breathe on him 
i thought it was me 
after a while  it just
gets easier to let it go 
do you still love him 
i don t think about it  shakes 
if i did  i d say  yes  
but you re with john now 
yeah   as much as
anybody can be with john 
the man i know is not
the boy you remember 
none of us are 
but there s something
special about john 
you just have to look a
little harder to see it 
why didn t you ever ask me out 
 me 
 yeah 
cause you were mikey s girl 
he got to you first 
and after mikey 
i think it was tommy s turn 
fuck you 
because   
   l didn t think you d say  yes  
well  you were wrong  shakes 
you were wrong 
what  go ahead and say it 
you work at social services  you
got files  you got access to files 
and from time to time  we re
gonna need some information 
yeah  sure   whatever   
wait  what 
well  what do you want 
you want information 
you want me to get the files 
i ll get the files 
what do you want 
you still visit john 
yeah  once a week for about an hour 
 good 
 good 
yeah  good  just don t tell
him that you ve seen me 
just don t tell him anything 
i mean  the more he thinks this thing s
hopeless  the better it might work 
shakes  what is this about 
you want a rolls royce 
you don t come here 
you go to england or wherever
the fuck they make it 
if you want champagne 
you go see the french 
if you need money  you find a jew 
but if you want dirt or scum buried
under a rock somewhere  or   
   some secret nobody wants anybody to
know about  there s only one place to go 
right here  hell s kitchen 
it is the lost and found of shit 
they lose it and we find it 
forget about it  man 
now  you only got two witnesses
who are gonna testify 
two others changed their minds 
 which two 
 the suits at the bar 
so that still leaves the
couple in the booth 
for now 
everything else falling into place 
except for your witness 
that pocket s still empty 
i know 
when you were sent away 
i was always sorry i
couldn t do more for you 
i didn t know you liked
pigeons so much 
i like anything that don t talk 
michael s vision on where he wanted
this case to go was very clear 
he was aiming for guilty   
   a charge of guilty against
the wilkinson home for boys   
   against sean nokes  adam styler 
henry addison  and ralph ferguson 
i will present to you evidence and offer
into account testimony to prove that 
i will place them at
the scene of the crime 
i will bring witnesses to the stand
who will confirm   
   that they were there
on that deadly night 
i will present enough evidence that
you can then go into a jury room   
   and come back with a clear decision
that s beyond a reasonable doubt 
i m sure you all know what that means   
   since you probably watch
as much television as i do 
john   john reilly
and thomas marcano   
   are two innocent pawns 
quickly arrested and just   
   as quickly prosecuted on the   
   slightest threads of evidence 
look on the bright side  he
seems to know their names 
i don t have to tell you  you and i
know how these things work 
it s nice when you come around 
hey  bring me another spoon 
this one s dirty 
take it 
no  no  she ll do it 
how s work 
i m still there 
you know  pop  l   
   l went down to the courthouse 
you know  i saw john and tommy 
i started thinking back
to when we were young    
where s the chicken 
so    
nothing  i was just thinking 
you re doing good  right 
yeah  doing good 
good 
what the hell do these things do 
they re for praying 
look at all this shit 
what  does your mother think you re
in the fucking army or something 
ain t none of it on the approved list 
i m sure your mommy
got a copy of that list 
my mother can t speak english that well 
don t blame us for your fucking
mother being stupid  all right 
when are you gonna let us hear you pray 
maybe he needs something to pray for 
put your hands on the table
and lay them flat 
spread your legs 
now start thinking up some prayers 
we don t hear no praying 
you better start  or styler might
lose his baton up your ass 
blessed art thou among women   
   and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb  jesus    
pray nice and loud 
fucker  pray  come on  now 
 louder 
 hail mary   
louder  fucker 
pray like you re in fucking church 
sorry i m late 
i lost all track of time 
i got this idea for a witness 
but i m not quite sure yet 
but i want you to come along 
so  you want to just go   
 where are we going 
 to his place 
 where is it 
 it s in the rectory 
no  shakes 
 just trust me 
 i can t 
how was court today 
like the first round of a fight   
everybody just feeling each other out 
how did the boys look 
like they wished they
were someplace else 
it s the sheep that stray
that you most want back 
it s not too late  father 
we still have a chance to bring in
a couple of stray sheep   
   one more chance 
is that chance legal 
last chances never are 
king benny behind this 
he s in on it  but   
he s not calling the shots 
who is 
michael 
i should ve smelled it 
the minute he went for the case 
i should ve figured something was up 
it s a good plan 
michael s got it all covered   
just about every base you look at 
he s got it covered 
not every base 
you re short something  or else
you wouldn t be here 
you don t shit a shitter  right 
that s right 
so  what is it 
where do you come up short 
witness 
we need somebody
to take the stand and say   
   they were with john and
tommy on the night of the murder 
so  you figured if you had a
priest  it would be perfect 
not just any priest 
you re asking me   
you re asking me to lie 
you re asking me to swear
to god and then lie 
i m asking you to save two of your boys 
 did they kill that guard 
 yes 
so what they said is true 
they walked in and they killed him 
yes 
they killed him exactly like that 
i think i need a drink 
anyone want a drink 
this is some favor you re asking me 
we know that 
no  i don t think you do know 
you said  if there was ever
anything really important   
   l could come to you  ask you 
i was thinking more along
the lines of yankee tickets 
i don t need yankee tickets  father 
i need a witness 
what about the life that was taken 
shakes  what s that worth 
to me  nothing 
why not 
tell me 
he was a guard at wilkinsons 
all right 
if father bobby was gonna be involved  he
deserved to know what he s getting into 
if he wasn t  i trusted that the truth
would go no further than this room 
i thought that carol
needed to know  as well 
jesus christ  we were just boys 
we were not tough 
they held us down 
i told him about the torture 
the beatings  and the rapes 
i told him about the four
frightened boys who prayed   
   to father bobby s god
for help that never came 
i told them everything 
we can t fight anymore 
they just took it all 
john used to wail at night  hear
it all the way down the hall 
you know he wanted to be a priest 
john wanted to be a priest 
then he pulls his pants down 
i didn t even know what a blow job was 
i just blacked out what i could 
it was like i couldn t even breathe 
then   l started to choke 
he was pulling the hairs out
of the back of my head 
then i blacked out 
but i do remember when  for fun 
they d take us down in the basement   
   tie two or three of us together   
   and make the other watch as they
pulled down their pants and fucked em 
i got a decision to make 
i only pray it s the right one 
it will be  father   
whichever way you go 
good night 
so  you were sitting down 
you were having dinner   
   and two men entered
mchale s  correct 
did you see them as they approached
the table where mr  nokes was sitting 
i noticed it  yes 
did you hear what
was said between them 
 did you see them pull out their guns 
 no 
 did you hear the shots 
 yes  i heard the shots 
and what did they do  what was
their behavior after the shooting 
they walked out of mchale s
as if nothing had happened 
and at that time  mrs  salinas 
did you see their faces clearly 
yes  i looked up as they walked away 
 are you positive 
 yes  very positive 
are the two men you saw at
mchale s in this room today 
yes  they are 
could you point them
out to the jury  please 
they re sitting right over there 
your honor  will the record reflect that
mrs  salinas has identified defendants   
   john reilly and thomas marcano
as the two men in question 
noted 
thank you  no further questions 
counsel  are you ready to proceed 
yes  your honor  we are 
good morning 
i just have a few questions  i won t
take too much of your time  mrs  salinas 
you stated that you only had wine to
drink with dinner  is that correct 
are you sure about that  are you sure
that was all you had  one bottle of wine 
yes  a bottle of red chianti 
had you anything to drink prior to that 
what do you mean  prior  
at lunch   maybe did you have
anything to drink at lunch 
yes  i did 
what did you have to drink 
i went shopping  and i stopped
at a place on madison avenue   
    for some lunch 
 see  i didn t ask you where you went 
i asked you what you
had to drink at lunch 
 a martini 
 and what else 
probably some wine 
yes  and how many glasses of
wine did you have to drink 
one glass  maybe two 
 closer to two 
 yes  probably two glasses 
it s like pulling teeth 
i should ve pinned the
questions to his shirt 
and tell me  then at dinner you   
strike that 
what time  mrs  salinas 
did you have lunch 
objection  your honor 
what mrs  salinas did on the
day of the murder   
   has nothing to do with what she
saw on the night of the murder 
how much she had to
drink does  your honor 
overruled 
mrs  salinas  what time
did you have lunch 
about one thirty 
and what did you have for lunch 
it was a while ago 
probably a salad 
i like to eat a little light in the day 
a martini  two glasses of wine
and a salad  is that correct 
yes  that s right 
and then you had wine at dinner 
about 6 hours later  is that correct 
yes  that s right 
how much wine did you have to drink   
   by the time my clients allegedly
walked into mchale s 
 two glasses 
 would you say that four glasses of wine   
   and a martini within a 6 hour
period is a lot for you to drink 
yes  it is 
have you ever heard a gun fired 
prior to the night in question 
how would you describe the sound 
it was loud  like fireworks loud 
 did the sound frighten you 
 very much 
did you close your eyes 
at first   until the shooting stopped 
then i opened them 
did you think the men who were shooting
were going to kill everybody in mchale s 
well  i really didn t know what to think 
i just knew that the man had been shot 
did you think you might be shot dead
by the two cold blooded killers 
yes  i did 
yet  despite that fear  despite
that risk to your life   
   you looked at their
faces as they left 
 yes  i did 
 is that correct 
yes  i did 
did you look at their faces 
did you really   
   really look  mrs  salinas 
i glanced at them when they
walked by  but i did see them 
you   glanced 
you didn t look 
i saw them 
you glanced at them  mrs  salinas 
you glanced at them through the eyes   
   of a very frightened woman who
maybe had too much to drink 
 objection  your honor 
 there is no need  your honor 
i have no further questions 
thank you  mrs  salinas 
you may step down 
it was 6 15 on sunday morning 
frank magicco worked out of
a homicide unit in brooklyn 
he was a first grade detective with
an honest name and a solid reputation 
he was also king benny s nephew 
nick davenport
was with internal affairs 
he was ambitious and wanted to make
captain before he hit forty 
he knew the fastest way up
the track was to reel in a   
   maximum amount of dirty cops
in a minimum amount of time 
frank  what is this shit 
if i were you  i d do what the kid says 
you make this one   
   you re gonna be having breakfast
once a month with the commissioner 
you know  you got a real hard on for this
styler guy  what s your beef with him 
 one more thing 
 i can t wait 
it s simple  no one knows who fed you
this information  and i mean  nobody 
how did you get it 
it fell into my lap   just like
it s gonna fall into yours 
christ almighty 
you got everything in
here but a confession 
i thought i d leave that up to you 
my preference is that
you beat it out of him 
there s even surveillance photos 
this piece of shit s pulling in about
five grand a month  ripping off pushers 
has been for about 3 years 
 more like 4 
 he ain t gonna see 5 
so  you got enough for conviction 
that ain t up to me 
that s up to a jury 
show the jury this 
what do you got there  ness 
about 3 weeks ago 
the body of a drug dealer   
   named indian red l pez was found
in an alley in jackson heights 
three bullets in his head 
nothing in his pockets 
i m with you so far 
this is the gun that killed him 
and these are the shells 
what s behind door number 3 
the prints on the gun
belong to adam styler 
 hey  do me a favor  would you 
 what s that 
if i ever make it onto your
shit list  give me a call 
give me a chance to apologize 
so  you need anything else  you talk to
frank  he knows how to get a hold of me 
take care of yourself  kid 
water gets choppy out your way 
i ll do what i can 
hey  ness   did you ever
think of becoming a cop 
and leave the good guys 
the body of christ 
the body of christ 
michael had done all
that could be expected   
   of an assistant district attorney
seeking a conviction 
he had a forensic expert detail the make
and caliber of the gun that killed nokes 
he just never had the murder
weapon to present as evidence 
and he never gave the jury
a motive for the murder 
the tension of his task 
the hours he was working   
   and the uncertainty about
the outcome weighed heavily on him 
did you see their faces 
yes  i looked at them 
and they looked at me 
did they say anything to you 
no  they just looked at me
and walked out of mchale s 
are you sure the two
defendants killed sean nokes 
i know they killed him 
if the plan worked  it would
be everyone s success 
if it failed  the fault
would fall to michael 
father bobby carillo  the priest with
the best hook shot on the west side   
   remained the key to a plan that called
for all involved to get away with murder 
did you turn around  look behind you 
when you heard the shooting  mr  carson 
why didn t you turn around  mr  carson 
i was concerned for my
companion s safety 
mr  carson  did the two individuals
threaten you in any way 
did they threaten anyone
in mchale s restaurant    
i didn t see it  but i know it 
if you didn t see the defendant
shoot the guard   
   then how do you know it was
the defendant that shot him 
so  what s the emergency 
shakes shouldn t have sent you 
it s too risky 
hey  nobody sent me 
i wanted to see you 
why 
shakes met with father bobby
2 weeks ago 
 he hasn t heard from him since 
 it s not an overnight decision for him 
 what if he doesn t testify 
 then we got a very serious problem 
have shakes talk to father bobby again 
have him tell him the whole story 
he ll know what that means 
he already has 
what  
i   was with him when he
talked to father bobby 
i heard everything  michael 
so  you know 
if only you told me 
i think things could ve been different 
if you could ve talked 
maybe   maybe we   
maybe    
carmen  that diet is working 
i don t care what anybody says 
you still have a thing for doris day 
she was a good woman 
you know the strega 
it s hard to miss a lady with
four warts and only one eye 
she needs the heads 
take this to the witch 
now  why does she need that 
 she takes the eyes 
 wonderful 
puts them in a bowl and mixes
them with water and oil 
and then 
people get headaches  they go to her 
she looks into their eyes   
   and tells them who is
wishing the headaches 
she says a few words  and
the headaches go away 
once in a while  the person who
wished the headaches  goes away too 
this guy  addison  the one
who works for the mayor   
   he quits his job in 2 weeks 
he don t want nobody to know
what kind of a guy he is 
he don t want nobody to see
pictures of him they shouldn t see 
 he knows this 
 he will 
the boys he buys for
parties are expensive 
now  addison makes good money 
but he don t make real money 
how much does he owe 
eight grand with a heavy vig 
i paid that off 
 you paid 
 addison s debts belong to me now 
 you hate debts 
 i hate addison 
we re in the dirty end of the field now 
that s where i play 
and i like to play alone 
you re a nice kid  you always were 
don t let this change it 
his mother named him edward goldenberg
robinson  after her favorite actor 
to continue the hollywood connection   
eddie robinson took the street name
 little caesar    
   as he made his way up the ranks
of the lucrative drug trade 
he had a 12 year old son in a
private school in upstate new york 
he named him rizzo 
after his youngest brother   
   who died while in the custody
of the wilkinson home for boys 
 i want you to give me some money 
 all right 
i ll play along 
how long before you pay it back 
i ain t paying it back 
somebody else is 
this somebody i know 
 your little brother knew him 
 rizzo 
how did he know rizzo 
henry addison was a guard
in an upstate reform school 
he was there the same time as rizzo 
before and after he died 
count out  8 000 
put it in an envelope 
you   go back a long time  old man 
old men always do 
ran with the guineas  back
when the guineas were tough 
i ran when i could 
looked good doing it  too 
gave the business some style  some class 
made it a call for respect  the way
you wore it   the way you talked it 
i always liked that about you 
i m no help to you 
my tailor is dead 
i ll look up our friend and
collect the money he owes me 
he owes you something more than money 
ain t nothing worth more than the green 
 this is 
 what  old man 
what s this guy owe that
means more than dollars 
he owes you rizzo  he s the man
that killed your brother 
they said he died of pneumonia 
they said 
what is the relevance of this 
so  ralph ferguson is
a sunday school teacher 
i don t know  counsel 
what you re asking is highly unusual 
i understand that  your honor  again 
i need to put a face to the victim 
otherwise it s just another
name in the obituaries 
mr  snyder  any objections 
i don t have a problem with that 
your honor  the prosecution would like
to call ralph ferguson to the stand 
 good morning  mr  ferguson 
 good morning 
i d like to thank you for coming  i
understand it s been a long trip for you 
i m just sorry it had to be
for something like this 
you and the victim  sean nokes 
were such good friends 
i think your testimony as a character
witness will be very valuable 
we were great friends  it would
be hard to find a better friend 
 would you say you were his best friend 
 i was his closest  that s for sure 
 how long did you know each other 
 about 17  18 years 
and did you see each other often 
as often as we could   
weekends  holidays  vacations 
 what kind of man was sean nokes 
 he was a good man 
he was too good to be shot dead
by a couple of street punks 
objection  your honor  statement
is one of opinion not fact 
he was asked his opinion 
overruled  please proceed 
mr  ferguson   were you aware of
any enemies he might have had 
sean nokes had no enemies 
thank you  mr  ferguson 
i have no further questions 
is that a prison 
no  it s a juvenile
facility for young boys 
your function was what at this facility 
standard stuff 
keep the boys in line  make sure
they got to classes on time    
keep an eye out for trouble 
put them down for the night 
as guards  were you and
mr  nokes allowed to use force to   
   as you put it 
 keep the boys in line  
what   what do you mean  force 
were you allowed to hit them 
of course not 
were any of the boys hit by any of the
guards any time at the wilkinson home 
i m sure something like that
may have happened  it was a   
   big place  but it wasn t
the common practice 
let s narrow the place down 
did you or mr  nokes ever hit any
of the boys under your care   
   at the wilkinson home for boys 
would you like me to
repeat the question 
no 
then answer it  please 
and remember  you re under oath 
a few of the boys who we considered
to be discipline problems   
   were hit on occasion 
and how were they hit 
 i don t know what you mean 
 a fist 
open hand  kick  baton  maybe 
 depends on what the situation called for 
 who determined that situation 
the guard on the scene 
that s a lot of power to
have over a boy  isn t it 
 it came with the job  sir 
 did torture come with the job 
boys were tortured  weren t they 
mr  ferguson 
define torture 
well  let s define torture 
cigarette burning   
   random beatings   
   solitary confinement
with no food and no light 
 say that took place 
 on occasion 
 who tortured them 
 guards 
which guards 
i can t remember all of them 
remember one 
remember one 
this line of questioning better lead
somewhere having to do with this case 
 it will  your honor 
 for your sake 
mr  ferguson  was there ever any sexual
abuse at the wilkinson home for boys 
was there ever any sexual abuse
at the wilkinson home for boys 
yes  i heard that there was 
i m not asking what you heard 
i m asking   what you   saw 
please  ferguson  don t do this 
i thought you boys liked it 
yes  i saw 
did you and sean nokes ever
force yourself on any of the boys 
did you and sean nokes ever rape   
   any of the boys at wilkinson home 
counselors   approach 
i just fucked your
little friend  johnny 
counselor  what the
hell is going on here 
i guess i called the
wrong character witness 
counselor  i ve given you wide latitude
in calling this character witness   
   now  it s blown up in your face 
please mr  ferguson 
don t do this  please 
mr  ferguson 
please answer the question 
 mr  ferguson  sean nokes   
 i like it nice and slow 
   visited your home on numerous
occasions  is that correct 
did you ever leave sean nokes
alone with your child 
a child 
yes  in other words  would your
ex wife ever leave sean nokes alone   
   with your child 
there would be no reason for that 
there would be no reason for him to be
alone with our child  it wouldn t come up 
never came up 
did she ever voice any concern 
we have a statement explaining
why she would never allow   
   sean nokes to be in a
room alone with your son 
 objection 
 sustained 
you ain t gonna touch me ever again 
yes    
yes 
yes  what 
yes  sean nokes had
experiences with some boys 
 were you there 
 yes 
 did you observe these experiences 
 yes 
did you do more than observe 
i was drinking then    
were there any other guards
around during these experiences 
yes 
 with you and mr  nokes 
 yes 
 on more than one occasion 
 yes 
mr  ferguson  do you still think
that sean nokes was a good man 
he was my friend 
a friend who raped and abused
boys he was paid to look after 
i have no further questions 
i want this to be over 
i want this to be over 
witness is excused 
mr  ferguson   
mr  ferguson  if i were you   
   l wouldn t stray too far from home 
people will want to talk to you 
do you understand 
michael continued to swim both ends
of the pool at the same time 
playing prosecution and defense attorney 
he exposed ferguson for what he was   
   and still kept john and tommy s
motive for killing nokes   
   hidden from the eyes of the court 
little caesar  who always kept a picture
of his dead brother in his breast pocket   
   called in the henry addison loan 
it was a loan addison couldn t
afford to pay back 
and it gave little caesar
the only reason he needed   
   to even his score for rizzo 
davenport wasted little time on
following up on adam styler 
he was quickly arrested and charged
with the shooting death   
   of the queens drug dealer  and eight
counts of corruption and bribery 
that s six for me  two for you 
most people play this game
in the summer 
it s easier to see the ball
without tears in your eyes 
i give a fuck about most people 
you re gonna have a heart attack   
and i m not breathing in your mouth 
well  i m not going to marry you either 
john and tommy smell something 
they just don t know what 
a spic be living in the white house by
the time it reaches their fucking brains 
snyder came through big 
he s not half bad 
the way you told it  i thought
he could hardly stand up 
he s a drunk  but he s not a fool 
we only win when john and tommy walk 
then you ll have to get them
out of the shooting hall 
you have to put them some place else 
and only a witness does that for you 
now  he s doing a claude rains so far 
nobody s seen the fucker 
what if he doesn t show  what if
we have to go on the way we are 
the street is the only one that matters 
court is for uptown people
with suits  money   
   lawyers with three names  if you
got cash  you can buy court justice 
but on the street  justice has no price 
she s blind where the judge sits 
but she s not blind out here 
 out here  the bitch got eyes 
 we need both 
then you need a witness 
ladies and gentlemen of the jury 
you are to disregard   
   the testimony of ralph ferguson 
his entire testimony is
stricken from this record 
that concludes the people s case 
your honor 
 the people rest 
 the people rest 
is the defense ready to proceed 
your honor  i don t   
i don t know 
you don t know 
well  i m not sure that   
we re waiting   
9 00 a m  tomorrow morning  present
a witness or be prepared to sum up 
everything good 
i found it very interesting
attending morning mass 
your honor  the defense
calls father robert carillo 
father  do you know most of
the people in your parish 
i know all the people in my parish 
do you know the two defendants 
john reilly and thomas marcano 
 how long have you known them 
 since they were boys 
they were both students of mine 
remain standing 
 how long have you been there 
 it ll be twenty years this spring 
i m a priest 
in the case of the people
of the state of new york   
   against john reilly
and thomas marcano   
   do you swear the evidence
you are about to give is the truth   
   the whole truth and nothing
but the truth  so help you  god 
i do 
acting pastor  serve mass daily 
listen to confessions    
do you recall where you were on the
night of november first this past year 
 yes  i do 
 where was that 
i was at the basketball game at
the garden  the knicks vs  the celtics 
and when did the knicks game begin 
 about 7 30 
 what time did it end 
between 9 30 and 10 00 
do you remember who won that game 
sad to say  it was the celtics 
kevin mchale and robert parish were
a little too much for our boys that night 
even if it was all saints day 
next time  you give me a call 
i ll try my guy 
i ll try that 
father carillo 
were you at the game alone 
no  i went there with two friends 
and who were those two friends 
john reilly and thomas marcano 
 the two defendants 
 yes  the same two defendants 
father carillo  at 8 25 p m  
the time the police say   
   victim sean nokes was murdered   
   were you still with mr  reilly and
mr  marcano at the basketball game 
yes  i was 
and what time did you  mr  reilly 
and mr  marcano part company 
it was around 10 30   a little later 
they dropped me off in front of the
rectory  near where they d picked me up 
did the two defendants tell
you where they were going 
no  they didn t  but i imagine 
after a night spent with a priest   
   they went looking for the
first open bar they could find 
so then  father  if the two defendants
were with you at 8 25   
   the night of the murder  they couldn t
have shot and killed sean nokes   
   as the prosecution contends 
isn t that correct 
not unless they shot him from
the blue seats at the garden 
he was not shot from there 
and he was not shot by those boys 
no further questions  your honor 
your witness  mr  sullivan 
thank you  your honor 
did you buy the tickets for the game
father  or were they given to you 
 no  i bought them 
 on the day of the game 
i went to the box office
about a week before 
did anyone know you were going to the
game  other than the two defendants 
i don t think so 
was anyone with you when
you purchased the tickets 
no 
 no one saw you buy the tickets 
 that s right 
 did you get a receipt 
 no  i didn t 
paid by check 
mastercard  visa 
no  i paid by cash 
i usually pay for things in cash 
you care for the boys in your parish 
don t you  father 
very much 
and there isn t anything you
wouldn t do for them  am i right 
anything in my power to do 
i would make it a point 
like a father  a good father 
looking out for one of his sons 
something along those lines  yes 
and is it true then  as a good father 
you would want to protect them   
   from something they
shouldn t have done 
as much as i would want to protect them
from what someone else said they did 
 like a murder 
 yes  like a murder 
let me get this straight then 
no one knew you were going to the game 
no one saw you at the game  no one
saw you buy tickets for the game 
there s no record you even
bought tickets 
you have no receipt for the tickets 
 am i correct 
 yes  that s correct 
then how do we really know  father 
how do we know   
   you and the two defendants were
at the game on the night of the murder 
i m telling you as a witness   
and as a priest  we were at the game 
yes  as a priest  and a priest
wouldn t lie  am i right 
a priest with ticket stubs
wouldn t need to lie 
i always keep the stubs 
do you want to see them 
why is that  father 
why do you keep the stubs 
because you never know when someone
might want more than your word 
has anyone ever questioned
your word before today 
no  no one ever has  but there s
a first time for everything 
i have no further questions 
thank you  father 
thank you  father 
you may step down 
i ve never recovered from seeing father
bobby take the stand and lie for us   
   to even the score for john and tommy 
he didn t just testify for them 
he testified against wilkinson s   
   and the evil that had lived
there for too long 
still  i was sorry he had to do it 
with respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree   
   do you find the defendant 
john reilly  guilty or not guilty 
not guilty 
with respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree   
   do you find the defendant  thomas
marcano  guilty or not guilty 
not guilty 
thank you very much
