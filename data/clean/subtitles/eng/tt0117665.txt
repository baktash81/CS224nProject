friends in my life who truly mattered
two of them were killers who
never made it past the age of thirty
the other is a nonpracticing attorney
living with the pain of his past
too afraid to let it go
never confronting its horror
im the only one who could speak for
themand the children we were
my three friends and
i were inseparable
happy and content to live in the
closed world of hells kitchen
the west side streets of manhattan
were our private playground
a cement kingdom where we felt we
were nothing less than absolute rulers
hells kitchen was populated
by an uneasy blend of
irish italian puerto rican
and eastern european laborers
hard men living hard lives
we lived in railroad apartments
inside red brick tenements
few mothers worked and all had
trouble with the men they married
i buried one fucking wife
i could bury another one
domestic violence was a cottage
industry in hells kitchen
yet there was no divorce
and few separations
the will of the church was forceful
for a marriage to end
someone usually had to die
yet despite the harshness of life
hells kitchen offered the kids
on its streets a safety net
enjoyed by few other neighborhoods
crimes against people of the
neighborhood were not permitted
when they did occur the punishment
doled out was severe
and in some cases final
a drug dealer from uptown
moved heroin into hells kitchen
a packet killed the twelveyear old
son of a puerto rican numbers runner
it was the last packet
the dealer ever sold
hells kitchen was a place of
innocenceruled by corruption
my friends and i spent lots of time
inside holy angels
we each served as altar boys
everyone wanted to work
funeral masses
since the funeral included a 3 fee
and more if you looked
sufficiently somber
there was an active competition
between the four of us
to come up with the best
and boldest prank
two weeks into the new school year
i found the nuns clacker in
the school hallway
and i was ready for the big leagues
in church it was used to alert
the girls as to when
they should stand sit
kneel and genuflect
all based on the number of
times the clacker was pressed
in my pocket it was cause for havoc
you will be defenders of the faith
you will be soldiers of christ
and you will receive the gifts
of the holy spirit
its gonna be a great day and your
parents will be proud of you
when you were baptized
godparents made promises for you
and now
youre gonna confirm those promises
let me have the clacker
what clacker
now
let everyone rise
let us pray
nuns are such easy targets
john and i spent more time in
church than the others
we were the only two in the group to give
any thought of entering the priesthood
and john and i were intrigued by
the powers the priest was given
a secret world of betrayal
and deceit where people
openly admitted dark misdeeds
and vile indiscretions
confession was better than any
book we could get our hands on
or any movie we could see
because the sins were real
committed by people we knew
the temptation to be part of that
was far too great to resist
if we get caught theyll burn us
what if our mothers are out there
what if we end up hearing
their confessions
what if we hear something worse
like what
like a murder what if
somebody cops to a murder
relax all weve got to do is sit back
listen and remember not to laugh
seconds later
our booth comes to life
isleep with married men
men with families
in the morning i tell myself
its the last time but it never is
yes
you see imim pregnant
the father
take a number
what are you going to do
i know what you want me to do
and i know what i should do
i just dont know what im gonna do
look i gotta go
thanks for listening fellas
i really appreciate it
i know youll keep it to yourselves
she knew
yeah she knew
why do you think she told us all that
i dont know i guess
she had to tell somebody
father robert carrillo was
a longshoremans son
who was as comfortable sitting on
a bar stool in a back alley saloon
as he was standing at the altar
during high mass
he had toyed with a life of petty
crime before finding his calling
he was a frienda friend who
just happened to be a priest
you know what crap like
that does to your body
come on father it beats smoking
and its cheaper too
maybe
so what do you hear anything
no nothing
i hear youre interested
in becoming a priest
who says
word is you want to get the
feel of a confessional booth
i dont know what youre
talking about father
you dont
maybe i got the wrong information
i guess you did
ill see you later tonight
whats tonight
i gotta drop some books
and magazines off
for the elderly and disabled
around the neighborhood
your mother said youd love to help
i bet she did
shakesl dont want you
getting into any trouble
come on father you know i never do
thats all i wish for
you and your friends
thats it
thats it nothing else
i swear thats it
you know a priest shouldnt swear
and kids shouldnt be listening
to other peoples confessions
ill see you tonight
all rightsee you
michael was the most sexually
experienced of our group
which meant that he kissed a girl
on more than one occasion
but his real love was carol martinez
hells kitchens halfbreed
half puerto rican half irish
she was raised by her father
her mother having died at childbirth
carol stayed pretty much to herself but
was always comfortable in our company
we could always count on carol
to stand sentry on the first night
of the ice capades
while crowds of families lined
the front of the garden
waiting to see the skaters perform
we each had one eye in a hole
watching two dozen beautiful
and nearly naked women
get into their skaters outfits
this is what heaven must be about
carol you want to take a look
like its something i havent seen
youre so lucky
shes so beautiful my god i could
die now and i wouldnt be sad
when my friends and i were young
hells kitchen was run
by a man named king benny
when he was young king benny
was a hit man for lucky luciano
lucky luciano did a lot of good for
this country during world war ll
but you aint gonna read about
that in any fucking history book
there was talk king benny was
the shooter of mad dog coll
that prick on west 23rd street
he ran bootleg with dutch schultz
and he opened up a couple of clubs
with tough tony anastasia
i was 14 when i first heard
about him the story goes
as a kid he wasnt much of anything
he was always getting the shit
kicked out of him in street fights
and then one day and who the
fuck knows why some irish guy
about 25 years old
he takes king benny
and he flings him down
a flight of stairs
king benny breaks all
his teeth in the front
you know what king benny does
he waits he waits 8 years
to get even with that prick
he walks into a public bath house
the guys soaking in the tub
king benny takes out his front teeth
he lays them down on the sink
then he looks over at
the guy and says
when i look in the mirror
i see your face
then he pulls out a gun
and he shoots the guy twice
in each leg
then he says to the guy
now when you take
a bath you see mine
no one ever fucked with
king benny after that
revenge
revenge
can i talk to you for a minute
id like to work for you
help you out whatever you need
youre the butchers kidam i right
what kind of a job are you looking for
whatever it doesnt matter
it doesnt matter
everybody says this is the
place to come for jobs
who is everybody
people from the neighborhood
let me ask you what
the fuck do they know
they know you got jobs
sorry i wasted your time
hold on a sec
come back tomorrow if you want to work
what time tomorrow
any time
youll be here
im always here
my first job for king benny
paid 25 a week and
ate up only 40 minutes of my time
in the dark club room one of the guys
would hand me a crumpled paper bag
and direct me to one of the two
local police precincts for delivery
it was a perfect way
to handle payouts
come on lets go right here
lets see what kind of cash
youve got in that bag
you gotta be nuts do you
know who youre taking off
yeah we know and
were scared shitless
give me the bag
give me the fucking bag
hey what you do there answer me
what you do there
this time they took my money
you took the money from the boy
the money they took is in the bag
let me have the bag
fuck you
how about now
all right take it easy
youre not smart anymore
this make you stupid
let me have the bag
now go
what about them
you care
then go go run
i need somebody with me
what if the old guy hadnt showed
what you need
my friends
your friends what do
you think this is camp
these kids you can trust
ive known them half my life
okay get your friends
father bobby knew we worked for
king benny and he wasnt pleased
he wasnt worried about the
pocket money but the next step
when they ask you to pick up a gun
he didnt want that to happen to us
you think running for king
benny is a good idea
it pays
a lot of things pay
not like this
most priests liked to
preach from the pulpit
father bobby liked to talk during the
bump and shove of a pickup game
good shot
i found an art class for you to take
you know i cant afford
to take any art classes
you dont have to pay anything
the teachers a friend of mine
it could be nothing but
a waste of time father
maybe or it could be the first step
first step to what
doing something with your life
you never know it may
help you get out of here
you all can get out of here
guys are we gonna talk
or play basketball
listen i got a story
i want to tell you
it aint the one about the lepers is it
cause that one gave me nightmares
no lepers michelangelo
he was born poor just like you guys
he was a painter he was a sculptor
he takes this job from the pope
good money good work
okay father but whyd
the pope call him
because the pope was looking for
the best guy he could find
to paint the ceiling
of his church in rome
it dont sound like
that big a job father
well for michelangelo it was
michelangelo needed the job
because it paid more money
than he ever had in his life
and that way he could pay off the loan
sharks that were chasing his father down
whats his father
he was like a lowlevelcon guy
conned people out of money
goats sheep
goats
chickens whatever he could you know
chickens
chickens
you know what happened
he painted a ceiling no
one will ever forget
painted it like he was touched
by the hand of god
did he pay off the loans
every single one of them
how long did it take him
painting the ceiling and all
it took him about 9 years
9 years
thats a big ceiling
i had a puerto rican do my
whole apartment in two days
and he had a bum leg
you know i dont know what
im gonna do with you guys
hey just give us a job painting
and leave the rest to us
you know what it was
the sistine chapel
sixteenth chapel
who painted the other fifteen
outside events meant little in a society
changing radically by the hour
we watched the images scatter
nightly across the tv screens
young protesters spoke about how they
were going to change our lives
and fix the world but while
they shouted their slogans
my friends and i went to
funeral services
for the young men
of hells kitchen
who came back from vietnam
in body bags
we viewed with skepticism
the faces on television
those protected by money and
uppermiddleclass standing
a growing army of feminists
marched across the country
demanding equality
yet our mothers still cooked
and cared for men who abused
them mentally and physically
for me and my friends these
developments carried no weight
they might as well have occurred in
another countryin another century
our attention was elsewhere
we sat with father bobby in a third
floor hospital ward visiting john
hoping hed recover from
a punctured lung
a gift from one of his mothers
overzealous boyfriends
i hope you like these
you better not tell me you dont
father bobby didnt let
that situation rest
i gave on sunday
im in a rush okay
john reilly
the little punk
he got out of line so i put him
back in line no big deal
you put him in the hospital
hes alive aint he look if hes
smart he learned himself a lesson
what are you about 220 230
youre a big guy how much
you think john reilly weighs
80 85
thats not even a featherweight
if this were a fight youd
be way out of your division
look it was a slap it was nothing
well next time youll be meeting me
and i may not be in your division but
i do weigh more than 85 pounds
and you wont need a doctor when
im done youll need a priest
to pray over your body
see you in church
father bobby wouldve
made a good hit man
its a shame we lost
him to the other side
we were down 76 in the last inning
of a sewertosewer stickball game
against hector maldonado
and three of his friends
come on davytake this chump out

for little girls with no legs
look stay away from this
fat man all right
you boys are soft like bread

and when it does its
going to hurtbad
what happens is our business
not yours okay
you gotta stay tough to be tough
guy smells it when youre weak
eat you like a salad
do you see that street
that street is the dish of life
and you boys are appetizers
somebody gonna come along eat you
up and forget about you by dessert
take it easy fat man
it was just stickball
yeah but going soft is a habit
you have to keep yourself mean
and cut your life around it
all right all right calm down
its like hanging out with fucking
confucius over here
be funny limp dick
look this is just free advice
from me to you
you take it or you throw it away
it dont matter
thanks a lot fat man
in truth we were all surprised
by michaels actions
but in his mind
losing that game meant
handing a feeling of victory
to a girl in a wheelchair
was more than the right thing to do
come on lets go swimming
the temperature topped out
at 98 degrees
on the day our lives
were forever altered
im frying like an egg up here
i say we get some buttered rolls
a couple of cold sodas and head
down to the docks
cant you feel the breeze up here
what breeze
were surrounded by a wall genius
the devil couldnt stand this heat
will you guys shut up please
im trying to get my burn
its 98 degrees
theres some breeze up here
its a hot breeze
we havent hit the hot dog
vendor in a couple of weeks
i dont know mikey that cart guy
aint like the others
i mean he gets pretty pissed like
crazy when you try to take him off
we can eat hot dogs
or we can eat airchoose
air is probably safer mike
yeah a hot dog aint worth
bleeding over mikey
yeah anyway whose turn is it
yours
yeah its yours
mine its not my turn
yes it is
i went like last month
he went two weeks
you never went
last month
are you nuts i went right after him
im not going
why
its too hot
if i walk down the
stairs ill pass out
mustard and onions no soda
i know you
i look like a lot of people
the scam was simple
i was to walk up to the hot dog
vendor and order what i wanted
the vendor would then hand me my hot
dog and watch as i ran off without paying
this left the vendor with two
choices neither very appealing
he could stand his ground and swallow
his loss or he could give chase
the second forces him
to abandon the cart
where my friends could
feast in his absence
im gonna need two napkins
pay my money thief
wow ketchup
i took it from him and ran
i scooted past tommy mugs dry
cleaners and armonds shoe repair
the vendor gave chase a wooden
handled pronged fork in one hand
you gonna give me two
you know these things are
heavier than they look
genius its the gas tanks
to keep the food hot
theyre heavier than shit
think we can push it the three of us
push it where
a couple of blocks itll be
a nice surprise for the guy
when he comes back from chasing
shakes not to find his cart
the vendor tired at 47th and 9th
i was on the other side of the street
he was beatbut not beaten
he could go ten minutes
more just on hate alone
give it up
whats wrong mikey
shakes is taking too long
he shouldve been back by now
hell be fine hes shakes
you guys were supposed to take
the hot dogs not the wagon
now he tells us
hes coming fast mikey
he still near
i got a plan come on
over by the subway
the plan was as simple and as dumb
as anything we had ever done
we were to hold the cart on the top
edge of the stairwell
leaning it downward
and wait for the vendor
we were to let it go the second
he grabbed the handles
then wed leave the scene as he struggled
to ease the cart back onto the sidewalk
to this day i dont
know why we did it
but we would all pay a price
it only took a minutebut
in that minuteeverything changed
guys i cant hold it
dont let go
i cant hold it
i cant hold it
stop god no
damn
sweet jesus what have you boys done
what in the name of god
have you boys done
i think we just killed a man
while james caldwell was slowly
recovering at st clares hospital
we were charged and remanded
into our parents custody
im sorry dad
sorry aint gonna do you much good
take it easy
this is no time to get crazy
youre going to jail and you dont
even know what the fuck that means
ma come look ma
i dont know bastard
hes just a kid
he shouldnt have to do time
nobody in this family should have to do
time i done enough time for everybody
i hear youre short an altar boy
you still remember what to do
easy on the water
heavy on the wine
and ring the bells whenever
i see someone start to nod off
get readywe got 5 minutes
till show time
im gonna miss this
im gonna miss all of this
ive been doing all i can but so
far every door i touch is locked
i could runwe all could run
disappear for a while
nobodys gonna come looking
nobodys gonna care about us
about where we go
you run now youre gonna
run till you die
hidings not gonna make it go away

i cant father
i dont want to face it
im too scared to face it
im scared too
nobodys more scared than i am
but you gotta do it
youre gonna be okay youre
gonna make it through there
you understand
come on we got an audience
i counted three rummies and
four widows on my way in
plus fat ralphie sleeping
one off in the last row
its the rain bad weather
always brings in the crowds
this is one of my favorites
what is
whatever you do to the least of
my brethrenyou do to me
come on
we never saw the vendor as a man
not the way we saw other
men of the neighborhood
and we didnt care enough about
him to grant him any respect
we gave little notice to how hard
he worked or that he had a wife
and two kids in greece and hoped
to bring them to this country
we didnt pay attention to
the long hours he worked
we didnt see any of that
we only saw a free lunch

the wilkinson home for boys
held 780 youthful offenders
housed in 5 separate units
from the outside the facility
resembled what those who ran it
wanted it to resemble
some kind of nice
school or university
michael tommy john and i were
assigned to the 2nd floor of group c
we each had a private 12 ft room
id been in my room less than an hour
when the panic set in
it doesnt take very long
to know how tough a person you are
or how strong you can be
i knew from my first day at wilkinson
that i was neither tough nor strong

and suffolk county police departments
styler was using his job at wilkinsons
to finance his way through law school
addison was a graduate of
a local high school
who wanted nothing more
than a steady job that paid well
it was not a group of innocent
young boys at wilkinson
most if not all the inmates

a number of them were riding out
their 2nd and 3rd convictions

sorry about what they had done

now we got interrupted earlier
in the lunch room but
theres no one
to interrupt us here now
what do you want
a blow job
down on your knees
face the wall
there are no clear pictures of
the sexual abuse we endured
i buried it as deep as
it could possibly go
what i remember most clearly
from that chilly october night
was that it was
my fourteenth birthday
and the end of my childhood
early in my stay id written and
asked my father not to come
i couldnt look at my father
and have him see on my face
all that had happened to me
michael had done the same with the
interested members of his family
tommys mother couldnt get
it together to visit
johns mother came up once a month
but no one could stop father
bobby from visiting
so listen lets try to keep
this on a happy note okay
nokes warned us not to say
anything to father bobby
if we did reprisals would be severe
you lost a few pounds
its not exactly home cooking
sit down
this is where i get to see
all four of you guys today
i loved father bobby but i
couldnt stand to look at him
i was afraid hed look
right through me
past the fear and shame
right through to the truth
shakes is there anything
you want to tell me
anything at all
you shouldnt come here anymore father
i appreciate it and all but
l dont think its the
right thing for you to do
i stopped off at attica today on my
way up here to see an old friend
you have any friends not in jail
not as many as i would like
whats he in for
triple murder he killed three
men about fifteen years ago
and hes a good friend
hes my best friend
we hung out together
we were close
just like you and the guys
we were both sent up here
thats right and it wasnt easy
just like its not easy
for you and the guys
this place killed him
made him not care anymore
dont let this place do
that to you shakes
dont let it make you think
youre tougher than you are
ive got to go father
ill see you in the kitchen
im counting on you
wipe the tears off your face
dont let them see it
dont let them see you crying
dont give them the satisfaction
youll be out of here
before you know it
youre gonna be okay
i didnt want to let him go
i never felt as close to anyone
as i felt to him at that moment
a number of the inmates as tough as
they acted during the day
would often cry themselves
to sleep at night
there were other cries too
these differed from those
filled with fear and loneliness
they were lower and muffled
the sounds of pained anguish
those cries can change
the course of a life
they are cries that once heard
can never be erased from memory
on this one night those cries
belonged to my friend john
when ralph ferguson
paid him a visit
i was expecting to read 30
book reports over the weekend
there are only 6 for me to read
which means im missing how many
this is english class
math is down the hall
i want to help you
you may not believe that
or you may not care but its the truth
you got a second
what i do something wrong
no you did a great
job on your book report
you really seemed to like the book
the count of monte cristo
its my favorite
i like it more since ive been here
why is that
its likehe wouldnt let
anyone beat him the count
took what he had to take
beatings insults and whatever
and he learned from it
then when the time came for him to
do something he made his move
you admire that
no i respect that
you got a copy of the book at home
i got the classics illustrated comic
no its not the same thing

well you love the book that much
you should have a copy of your own
i cant pay you
its a gift

well its my way of saying thanks
for what
that somebody listens
even if its just one student
youre a good teacher mr carlson
listen we can discuss the book
on friday in class if you
think the count can
hold their attention
hes got a shot
any particular section
i should read from
thats easythe part where
he escapes from prison
there you go all star
heres your locker room
it was only a gamejust a touch
football game nothing more
but a game i wish we
had never played
guards against inmates
the guards practiced four times a week
our team was picked the
monday before the game
we had a 2 hour practice
it didnt matter much
we werent supposed to win
we were just supposed to show up
whos the toughest guy here
how do you mean tough
who can talk and have
everyone listening
rizzo black kid over there
michael saw an openinga chance
to bring the game to our level
even out the field but he needed help
he needed rizzo
black kid with an italian name
with him on our side we had a chance
look white boy i dont know
what you play in the streets
i dont care but in here
the guards call the play
and the play calls for
them to win the game
why
look man
guards stay clear of me all right
they stay back and let me do my time
if i play that game and i
put a hurt on one of them
they just might change my cushion
im not saying we gotta win
i just dont want to take a beating
you do every day
why is saturday special
cause on saturday we can hit back
they dont fuck with you like they do us
but they fuck with you another way
youre just an animal to them
i dont give a fuck
yeah you do
and beating them on saturday
is not gonna change a thing
then why white boy why
to make them feel what we feel
just for a couple of hours
now dont try anything funny sambo
nobody will get hurt
you know what im saying
i call heads
he called heads
it is a head
lets go
youre gonna die mother fucker
youre gonna fucking die
none of you motherfuckers can cover me
we got ourselves a game
im feeling good today
this shit feels good
fuck
get the fuck off me
yeah keep smiling you little piss ant
for 90 minutes we took
the game out of the prison
moved it miles beyond
the locked gates
and the sloping hills of
the surrounding countryside
and brought it back down to the streets
of the neighborhoods wed come from
for those 90 minutes
we were once again free
rizzo rizzo
rizzorizzo
hey nokes
good game
for once we had a victory
but it didnt last
it couldnt last
and all i wanted to do was die
i was not alone in the hole i knew my
friends were down in the depths with me
each in his own cell each in his own
painsuffering his own demons
rizzo was there too
i had lost any sense of time
i thought youd never wake up
i thought id never want to
john and tommy theyre
on the other side there
how are they
theyre alive
who isnt
rizzo
they killed him
they took turns beating him until
there was nothing of that kid to beat
rizzo was dead because of us
we made him think that going
up against the guards
in a meaningless football game
had some valuethat it would
give us a reason to go on
once again we were wrong
did they give you
your release date yet
nokes had a letter from the warden
waved it in front of me
then tore it up
when do you figure
end of spring early
summer or something
i wish we were coming with you
it wouldve been nice for all
of us to walk out together
no use thinking about that were
gonna do a full year not an hour less
when i get out i could get father
bobby to make a couple of phone calls
shave a month or two off
theres nothing to talk about
theres a lot to talk about
maybe if people knew what was going
on in here theyd make a move
i dont want anybody to know
not father bobby king benny
fat mancho
not my mother nobody
i dont either
i mean i wouldnt know what
to say to anyone who did know
i cant think of anybody
who needs to hear about it
either they wont believe it
or they wont give a shit
yeah i dont even think we should
talk about it once its over
we got no choice but to live with it
and talking makes living it harder
so we might as well
not even talk about it
the truth stays with us
i want to be able to sleep one night
and not have to worry whos coming
in my room whats gonna happen to me
if i can get that then ill be happy
someday john i promise
i was in my last hours as an inmate
at the wilkinson home for boys
i was given four copies
of my release form
the final reminder of my
time at wilkinson
i never heard the key
turn in the lock
and i never heard
the snap of the bolt
you should be asleep
i just wanted to say goodbye
we all do
i told him i told him right
to his face i said
i dont care if youre paying me
overtime or not
im not working those kind of hours
yeah did you put in for it
i put in for it
because i put in for it
they dont give it to me
i come in early for three days
do they give me overtime no
a part of all of us was
left there that night
that night will never be
removed from my mind
the night of june 1 1968
the summer of love
my last night at the
wilkinson home for boys
at 825 pm two men
walked through the doors
the bartender knew their faces as most
of the neighborhood knew their names
they were two of the founding
members of the west side boys
they were also its deadliest
the blondhaired man had been in and out
of jail since he was a teenager
he robbed and killed
at will or on command
he was presently a suspect in
four unsolved homicides
he was an alcoholic and a cocaine abuser
with a fast temper and a faster trigger
he once shot a mechanic dead for
moving ahead of him in a movie line
the darkhaired man was equally deadly
and had committed his
first murder at the age of 17
in return he was paid 50
he drank and he did drugs
and he had a wife he never saw
living somewhere in queens
hes making a noble attempt
to really change things
the republicans will take the house
well we got a lot of work to do
its gonna take more
than 4 years to get
theyll take it at
the midterm elections
hes got the charisma
hes gonna do it
hes our man reagans
the man whos gonna do it
hey jerry
what are they talking about
theyre talking about reagans speech
order those two men some
drinks and put it on my tab
you tell them that republicans
are not welcome in hells kitchen
and either a political conversion or
a change of conversation is in order
sure thing
the gentlemen there would like to
buy you a drink on one condition
you know the rules
no religion no politics
you get my meaning
order something for me
i gotta go to the bathroom
can i help you with something chief
not right now

with fries and
two baskets of soda bread

just to end up watching
someone elses money
that seems like a waste
im asking you now for the last
time what the fuck do you want
why dont you take your time
itll come to you
i can see how he might forget us
you know we were just something for
you and your friends to play with
its a little harder for us to forget
you gave us so much more to remember
you cant quite place us

jerry sorry shouldve made
those brisket sandwiches to go
john reilly how do you plead
not guilty your honor
thomas marcano
not guilty your honor
john reilly and thomas marcano
you are hereby held without bail
in all the years since wilkinsons we
had never once spoken to each other
about what happened there
we remained caring friends
but the relationship
had been altered
we drifted together always wondering
if that moment would arrive
that would force us to
deal with the past
one down shakes one down
one what
one sean nokes
nokes
at the time of nokes shooting
michael was working as an
assistant new york district attorney
i got a call that he wanted to meet me
on 45th street in queens
then he hung up
so what did they say
what
john and tommy whatd they say
its a little cloak and
dagger isnt it mike
nokes
did they talk about him
john did
yeah
what did he say
he said one down shakes
one down
i hear they hired danny snyder
as the lawyer is that right
its temporary king bennys
gonna move in one of his lawyers
dont let him do that
snyders perfect
perfect the guys a fall down drunk
then he is perfect
perfect for what
are you covering this
story for your newspaper
me
yeah
im a timetable clerk mikey ask me
what movies playing at what time
im lucky they let me in the building
get some coffee
lets take a walk
im gonna prosecute john
and tommy in an open court
what are you fucking nuts
just hear me out
you should stay home tomorrow
call in sick and save your life counsel
im not taking this case to win
im taking this case to lose
what does that mean
it means its payback time
look john and tommy started this
its begun
its messy its not how i had
it planned buthere it is
and you and l we can finish it
finish what mikey
you read the count of
monte cristo lately
i dont knowten years ago
you see i read a little
bit of it every night
i read words like revenge
sweet lasting revenge
payback time
its our time
what are you saying mike
im saying its time for
all of us to get a taste
im saying its time
to put an end to this
lets walk
so i asked for the case
i told them i was from the same
neighborhood as the accused
knew the mentality of the area
blah blah blah
they bought it
and the connection between
john tommy and nokes
what connection all juvenile records
are destroyed after seven years
we were never at wilkinsons
we gotta go after the guards
i gotta get wilkinsons
bring it all down
adam styler plainclothes cop
works narcotics in queens
known to shake down dealers for dope
and cash hes got a cocaine problem
other personal information there
henry addison now works for the mayor
if you can fucking believe that
hes a community outreach
director in brooklyn
his sexual habits havent changed
he still likes sex with young boys
ralph ferguson works in a social
service agency in long island
how long have you been
working on this mike
hes recently divorced got
one child and on weekends
teaches catholic sunday school
well he seems clean then right
thats exactly why i
want the piece of shit
the plan is to call ferguson
in as a character witness
get him talking about his
best friend sean nokes
once i got him on the stand im
gonna open the door to wilkinsons
mike are you sure you
want to go this way
i mean we buried this a long time ago
do you still sleep with the light on
john and tommy do you want them
to know anything about this
no itll play better in
court if they dont know
the not guilty verdict had to be a
verdict that no one would dare question
danny snyder was to remain as
tommy and johns attorney
michaels plan relied heavily
on hells kitchen
to deliver information and keep quiet
both were skills the neighborhood
had in abundance
wed set up a simple
method of communication
if michael was sending
messages were left at work
for me to call my nonexistent
girlfriend gloria
if i needed to get word to michael id
have someone from the neighborhood
pick up an early edition
of the new york times
write the word edmund in the upper
right hand corner of the metro section
and drop it in front
of michaels apartment
for this plan to succeed
we needed total secrecy of
the only people we completely trusted
the plan depended on
keeping michael alive
which meant that word had to get
to john and tommys killing crew
that he was not an open target
after this night michael would
not be available to any of us
the only time we would see
him would be in court
thats it
not quite
weve got four witnesses who saw the
shooting and are willing to testify
gotta get that number down
ill talk to king benny
good
i can handle two but
you gotta get us one for our side
one of what
one witness
a witness wholl put john  tommy
elsewhere on the night of the murder
a witness they cant touch
dont they have a name for that
a judge would call it perjury
and what are we calling it
a favor
get up
tony
yeah king
bring danny snyder to see me
who danny snyder the lawyer
you know more than one danny snyder
bring me the one you know
i cant do this now you gotta know that
its been a long time for me
you need somebody younger you know
somebody like i used to be
younger is not better
doesnt have experience doesnt
know its way around a courthouse
yeah im lucky i can
find the courthouse
i had only four cases last year
you know how many i won
none thats how many none
in two of them i think the
the jury blamed me personally
they mustve been innocent
its tough to get
innocent men off a rap
i wasnt even planning on
going to court with this one
i was just gonna plea it down
best i could and walk away
i wasnt planning on
taking this to trial sir
well your plans have been changed
well i am afraid that ill make a
mistake and say the wrong thing
make a wrong turn somewhere
and you dont want to take that risk
life is risk
im sorry
life is risk
life is a risk
i havent been in here before
what do you need me to do
youre gonna be given the
answers and the questions
all you have to do is read
you can read cant you
is it in english
just dont drift dont drink
and dont lose
what if i do lose
then youll go down for the dirt nap
never heard that expression before
dirt nap
im not really cut out for this anymore
i mean a guy gets hit by a bus
and sues i like that
some lady slips in a supermarket
im with her
the discussion is over
im an alcoholic this is a murder case
this isnt for me
it was once
before you let the drink lead
be sober by tomorrow
and dont look so worried snyder
youve got nothing to lose
just like the rest of us
i dont want to be a burden
to you but l
along with my alcohol problem
i have a slight drug problem
i mean nothing big
go away
within days of michael taking the case
the west side boys got a visit
from king benny
the king requested that the verbal abuse
directed towards michael continue
traitor and gutter rat were
heard up and down the avenue
but there was never to be
a death move against him
the hit on michael sullivan if there was
one could only come from king benny
the underground word
the only one that mattered
had spread through the streets with
the speed of a latenight bullet
king bennys sleepers
were making their play
sleepers was a street name for anyone
who spent time in a juvenile facility
you gonna pay for that
you little prick
need your help fat man
need a big favor
ill be outside
king benny been to see you
oh my goodness
what a fucking thing we put together
you have a drunk lawyer on one side
a kid lawyer on the other
fucking paper boy
making like dick tracy
there are four sets of eyeballs
that saw the whole thing
meanwhile the two on trial
kill more people than cancer
fucking general custer has
a better shot at a walk
theres no connection
with the guard and us
the cops think its a
drugrelated homicide
its just we need you to
pull a few strings fat man
you know if you get caught on this
youre looking straight at serious
im talking real jail
the big house
they are not good boys any more
theyre killers now
cold as stone
i know
i know what they were and i know
what they are and its not about that
its not worth it throwing
away life just to get even
you and the lawyer have
a chance to get out
to get out the right way
theres no choicenot for us
on occasion id have
dinner with carol
she still lived in the neighborhood and
was a social worker in the south bronx
her concern for us was undiminished
by the passing years
whenever we went out as a group carol
would walk between michael and john
grasping their arms
in step between the lawyer
and the killer
mug me or marry me shakes
im too tired for anything else
would you settle for a
couple of beers carol
if thats your best offer
ill throw in a hug and a kiss
deal
you look tired
thank you
they dont give you time to
sleep on this new job of yours
so how much do you know
just what the neighborhood says
and what i read in papers like yours
what does the neighborhood say
that theyre gonna put
johnny and tommy away
that their best friends
gonna be the one to do it
you believe that
its hard not to shakes
unless we all have it wrong
he did take the fucking case
he did take the case
what else is there to say
you know michael very well
maybe even better than i do
yeah i thought i did
now i dont know
you do know
i dont know
he went in there and
he asked for the case
now you tell me what the
hell kind of friend is that
the best kind
the kind wholl throw away
everything to help his friends
what are you telling me shakes
you know this neighborhood carol
everythings a shakedown or a scam
why should this be any different
im hungry
im gonna get something to eat
theres this point in michael
that you cant go beyond
i mean you can try i tried
and he justhe shut down
couldnt touch him
couldnt even breathe on him
i thought it was me
after a while it just
gets easier to let it go
do you still love him
i dont think about it shakes
if i did id say yes
but youre with john now
yeahas much as
anybody can be with john
the man i know is not
the boy you remember
none of us are
but theres something
special about john
you just have to look a
little harder to see it
why didnt you ever ask me out
me
yeah
cause you were mikeys girl
he got to you first
and after mikey
i think it was tommys turn
fuck you
because
l didnt think youd say yes
well you were wrong shakes
you were wrong
what go ahead and say it
you work at social services you
got files you got access to files
and from time to time were
gonna need some information
yeah surewhatever
wait what
well what do you want
you want information
you want me to get the files
ill get the files
what do you want
you still visit john
yeah once a week for about an hour
good
good
yeah good just dont tell
him that youve seen me
just dont tell him anything
i mean the more he thinks this things
hopeless the better it might work
shakes what is this about
you want a rolls royce
you dont come here
you go to england or wherever
the fuck they make it
if you want champagne
you go see the french
if you need money you find a jew
but if you want dirt or scum buried
under a rock somewhere or
some secret nobody wants anybody to
know about theres only one place to go
right here hells kitchen
it is the lost and found of shit
they lose it and we find it
forget about it man
now you only got two witnesses
who are gonna testify
two others changed their minds
which two
the suits at the bar
so that still leaves the
couple in the booth
for now
everything else falling into place
except for your witness
that pockets still empty
i know
when you were sent away
i was always sorry i
couldnt do more for you
i didnt know you liked
pigeons so much
i like anything that dont talk
michaels vision on where he wanted
this case to go was very clear
he was aiming for guilty
a charge of guilty against
the wilkinson home for boys
against sean nokes adam styler
henry addison and ralph ferguson
i will present to you evidence and offer
into account testimony to prove that
i will place them at
the scene of the crime
i will bring witnesses to the stand
who will confirm
that they were there
on that deadly night
i will present enough evidence that
you can then go into a jury room
and come back with a clear decision
thats beyond a reasonable doubt
im sure you all know what that means
since you probably watch
as much television as i do
johnjohn reilly
and thomas marcano
are two innocent pawns
quickly arrested and just
as quickly prosecuted on the
slightest threads of evidence
look on the bright side he
seems to know their names
i dont have to tell you you and i
know how these things work
its nice when you come around
hey bring me another spoon
this ones dirty
take it
no no shell do it
hows work
im still there
you know pop l
l went down to the courthouse
you know i saw john and tommy
i started thinking back
to when we were young
wheres the chicken
so
nothing i was just thinking
youre doing good right
yeah doing good
good
what the hell do these things do
theyre for praying
look at all this shit
what does your mother think youre
in the fucking army or something
aint none of it on the approved list
im sure your mommy
got a copy of that list
my mother cant speak english that well
dont blame us for your fucking
mother being stupid all right
when are you gonna let us hear you pray
maybe he needs something to pray for
put your hands on the table
and lay them flat
spread your legs
now start thinking up some prayers
we dont hear no praying
you better start or styler might
lose his baton up your ass
blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb jesus
pray nice and loud
fucker pray come on now
louder
hail mary
louder fucker
pray like youre in fucking church
sorry im late
i lost all track of time
i got this idea for a witness
but im not quite sure yet
but i want you to come along
so you want to just go
where are we going
to his place
where is it
its in the rectory
no shakes
just trust me
i cant
how was court today
like the first round of a fight
everybody just feeling each other out
how did the boys look
like they wished they
were someplace else
its the sheep that stray
that you most want back
its not too late father
we still have a chance to bring in
a couple of stray sheep
one more chance
is that chance legal
last chances never are
king benny behind this
hes in on it but
hes not calling the shots
who is
michael
i shouldve smelled it
the minute he went for the case
i shouldve figured something was up
its a good plan
michaels got it all covered
just about every base you look at
hes got it covered
not every base
youre short something or else
you wouldnt be here
you dont shit a shitter right
thats right
so what is it
where do you come up short
witness
we need somebody
to take the stand and say
they were with john and
tommy on the night of the murder
so you figured if you had a
priest it would be perfect
not just any priest
youre asking me
youre asking me to lie
youre asking me to swear
to god and then lie
im asking you to save two of your boys
did they kill that guard
yes
so what they said is true
they walked in and they killed him
yes
they killed him exactly like that
i think i need a drink
anyone want a drink
this is some favor youre asking me
we know that
no i dont think you do know
you said if there was ever
anything really important
l could come to you ask you
i was thinking more along
the lines of yankee tickets
i dont need yankee tickets father
i need a witness
what about the life that was taken
shakes whats that worth
to me nothing
why not
tell me
he was a guard at wilkinsons
all right
if father bobby was gonna be involved he
deserved to know what hes getting into
if he wasnt i trusted that the truth
would go no further than this room
i thought that carol
needed to know as well
jesus christ we were just boys
we were not tough
they held us down
i told him about the torture
the beatings and the rapes
i told him about the four
frightened boys who prayed
to father bobbys god
for help that never came
i told them everything
we cant fight anymore
they just took it all
john used to wail at night hear
it all the way down the hall
you know he wanted to be a priest
john wanted to be a priest
then he pulls his pants down
i didnt even know what a blow job was
i just blacked out what i could
it was like i couldnt even breathe
thenl started to choke
he was pulling the hairs out
of the back of my head
then i blacked out
but i do remember when for fun
theyd take us down in the basement
tie two or three of us together
and make the other watch as they
pulled down their pants and fuckedem
i got a decision to make
i only pray its the right one
it will be father
whichever way you go
good night
so you were sitting down
you were having dinner
and two men entered
mchales correct
did you see them as they approached
the table where mr nokes was sitting
i noticed it yes
did you hear what
was said between them
did you see them pull out their guns
no
did you hear the shots
yes i heard the shots
and what did they do what was
their behavior after the shooting
they walked out of mchales
as if nothing had happened
and at that time mrs salinas
did you see their faces clearly
yes i looked up as they walked away
are you positive
yes very positive
are the two men you saw at
mchales in this room today
yes they are
could you point them
out to the jury please
theyre sitting right over there
your honor will the record reflect that
mrs salinas has identified defendants
john reilly and thomas marcano
as the two men in question
noted
thank you no further questions
counsel are you ready to proceed
yes your honor we are
good morning
i just have a few questions i wont
take too much of your time mrs salinas
you stated that you only had wine to
drink with dinner is that correct

that was all you had one bottle of wine
yes a bottle of red chianti
had you anything to drink prior to that

at lunchmaybe did you have
anything to drink at lunch
yes i did
what did you have to drink
i went shopping and i stopped
at a place on madison avenue
for some lunch

i asked you what you
had to drink at lunch
a martini
and what else
probably some wine
yes and how many glasses of
wine did you have to drink
one glass maybe two
closer to two
yes probably two glasses
its like pulling teeth
i shouldve pinned the
questions to his shirt
and tell me then at dinner you
strike that
what time mrs salinas
did you have lunch
objection your honor
what mrs salinas did on the
day of the murder
has nothing to do with what she
saw on the night of the murder
how much she had to
drink does your honor
overruled
mrs salinas what time
did you have lunch
about onethirty
and what did you have for lunch
it was a while ago
probably a salad
i like to eat a little light in the day
a martini two glasses of wine
and a salad is that correct
yes thats right
and then you had wine at dinner
about 6 hours later is that correct
yes thats right
how much wine did you have to drink
by the time my clients allegedly
walked into mchales
two glasses
would you say that four glasses of wine
and a martini within a 6hour
period is a lot for you to drink
yes it is
have you ever heard a gun fired
prior to the night in question
how would you describe the sound
it was loud like fireworks loud
did the sound frighten you
very much
did you close your eyes
at firstuntil the shooting stopped
then i opened them
did you think the men who were shooting
were going to kill everybody in mchales
well i really didnt know what to think
i just knew that the man had been shot
did you think you might be shot dead
by the two coldblooded killers
yes i did
yet despite that fear despite
that risk to your life
you looked at their
faces as they left
yes i did
is that correct
yes i did
did you look at their faces
did you really
really look mrs salinas
i glanced at them when they
walked by but i did see them
youglanced
you didnt look
i saw them
you glanced at them mrs salinas
you glanced at them through the eyes
of a very frightened woman who
maybe had too much to drink
objection your honor
there is no need your honor
i have no further questions
thank you mrs salinas
you may step down
it was 615 on sunday morning
frank magicco worked out of
a homicide unit in brooklyn
he was a first grade detective with
an honest name and a solid reputation
he was also king bennys nephew
nick davenport
was with internal affairs
he was ambitious and wanted to make
captain before he hit forty
he knew the fastest way up
the track was to reel in a
maximum amount of dirty cops
in a minimum amount of time
frank what is this shit
if i were you id do what the kid says
you make this one
youre gonna be having breakfast
once a month with the commissioner
you know you got a real hardon for this
styler guy whats your beef with him
one more thing
i cant wait
its simple no one knows who fed you
this information and i mean nobody
how did you get it
it fell into my lapjust like
its gonna fall into yours
christ almighty
you got everything in
here but a confession
i thought id leave that up to you
my preference is that
you beat it out of him
theres even surveillance photos
this piece of shits pulling in about
five grand a month ripping off pushers
has been for about 3 years
more like 4
he aint gonna see 5
so you got enough for conviction
that aint up to me
thats up to a jury
show the jury this
what do you got there ness
about 3 weeks ago
the body of a drug dealer
named indian red lpez was found
in an alley in jackson heights
three bullets in his head
nothing in his pockets
im with you so far
this is the gun that killed him
and these are the shells
whats behind door number 3
the prints on the gun
belong to adam styler
hey do me a favor would you
whats that
if i ever make it onto your
shit list give me a call
give me a chance to apologize
so you need anything else you talk to
frank he knows how to get a hold of me
take care of yourself kid
water gets choppy out your way
ill do what i can
hey nessdid you ever
think of becoming a cop
and leave the good guys
the body of christ
the body of christ
michael had done all
that could be expected
of an assistant district attorney
seeking a conviction
he had a forensic expert detail the make
and caliber of the gun that killed nokes
he just never had the murder
weapon to present as evidence
and he never gave the jury
a motive for the murder
the tension of his task
the hours he was working
and the uncertainty about
the outcome weighed heavily on him
did you see their faces
yes i looked at them
and they looked at me
did they say anything to you
no they just looked at me
and walked out of mchales
are you sure the two
defendants killed sean nokes
i know they killed him
if the plan worked it would
be everyones success
if it failed the fault
would fall to michael
father bobby carillo the priest with
the best hook shot on the west side
remained the key to a plan that called
for all involved to get away with murder
did you turn around look behind you
when you heard the shooting mr carson
why didnt you turn around mr carson
i was concerned for my
companions safety
mr carson did the two individuals
threaten you in any way
did they threaten anyone
in mchales restaurant
i didnt see it but i know it
if you didnt see the defendant
shoot the guard
then how do you know it was
the defendant that shot him
so whats the emergency
shakes shouldnt have sent you
its too risky
hey nobody sent me
i wanted to see you
why
shakes met with father bobby
2 weeks ago
he hasnt heard from him since
its not an overnight decision for him
what if he doesnt testify
then we got a very serious problem
have shakes talk to father bobby again
have him tell him the whole story
hell know what that means
he already has
what
iwas with him when he
talked to father bobby
i heard everything michael
so you know
if only you told me
i think things couldve been different
if you couldve talked
maybemaybe we
maybe
carmen that diet is working
i dont care what anybody says
you still have a thing for doris day
she was a good woman
you know the strega
its hard to miss a lady with
four warts and only one eye
she needs the heads
take this to the witch
now why does she need that
she takes the eyes
wonderful
puts them in a bowl and mixes
them with water and oil
and then
people get headaches they go to her
she looks into their eyes
and tells them who is
wishing the headaches
she says a few words and
the headaches go away
once in a while the person who
wished the headaches goes away too
this guy addison the one
who works for the mayor
he quits his job in 2 weeks
he dont want nobody to know
what kind of a guy he is
he dont want nobody to see
pictures of him they shouldnt see
he knows this
he will
the boys he buys for
parties are expensive
now addison makes good money
but he dont make real money
how much does he owe
eight grand with a heavy vig
i paid that off
you paid
addisons debts belong to me now
you hate debts
i hate addison
were in the dirty end of the field now
thats where i play
and i like to play alone
youre a nice kid you always were
dont let this change it
his mother named him edward goldenberg
robinson after her favorite actor
to continue the hollywood connection
eddie robinson took the street name
little caesar
as he made his way up the ranks
of the lucrative drug trade
he had a 12yearold son in a
private school in upstate new york
he named him rizzo
after his youngest brother
who died while in the custody
of the wilkinson home for boys
i want you to give me some money
all right
ill play along
how long before you pay it back
i aint paying it back
somebody else is
this somebody i know
your little brother knew him
rizzo
how did he know rizzo
henry addison was a guard
in an upstate reform school
he was there the same time as rizzo
before and after he died
count out 8000

yougo back a long time old man
old men always do
ran with the guineas back
when the guineas were tough
i ran when i could

you wore itthe way you talked it
i always liked that about you
im no help to you
my tailor is dead
ill look up our friend and

he owes you something more than money
aint nothing worth more than the green
this is
what old man
whats this guy owe that

he owes you rizzo hes the man
that killed your brother
they said he died of pneumonia
they said
what is the relevance of this
so ralph ferguson is
a sunday school teacher
i dont know counsel
what youre asking is highly unusual
i understand that your honor again
i need to put a face to the victim
otherwise its just another
name in the obituaries
mr snyder any objections
i dont have a problem with that
your honor the prosecution would like
to call ralph ferguson to the stand
good morning mr ferguson
good morning
id like to thank you for coming i
understand its been a long trip for you
im just sorry it had to be
for something like this
you and the victim sean nokes
were such good friends
i think your testimony as a character
witness will be very valuable
we were great friends it would
be hard to find a better friend
would you say you were his best friend
i was his closest thats for sure
how long did you know each other
about 17 18 years
and did you see each other often
as often as we could
weekends holidays vacations
what kind of man was sean nokes
he was a good man
he was too good to be shot dead
by a couple of street punks
objection your honor statement
is one of opinion not fact
he was asked his opinion
overruled please proceed
mr fergusonwere you aware of
any enemies he might have had
sean nokes had no enemies
thank you mr ferguson
i have no further questions
is that a prison
no its a juvenile
facility for young boys
your function was what at this facility
standard stuff
keep the boys in line make sure
they got to classes on time
keep an eye out for trouble
put them down for the night
as guards were you and
mr nokes allowed to use force to
as you put it
keep the boys in line
whatwhat do you mean force
were you allowed to hit them
of course not
were any of the boys hit by any of the
guards any time at the wilkinson home
im sure something like that
may have happened it was a
big place but it wasnt
the common practice
lets narrow the place down
did you or mr nokes ever hit any
of the boys under your care
at the wilkinson home for boys
would you like me to
repeat the question
no
then answer it please
and remember youre under oath
a few of the boys who we considered
to be discipline problems
were hit on occasion
and how were they hit
i dont know what you mean
a fist
open hand kick baton maybe
depends on what the situation called for
who determined that situation
the guard on the scene
thats a lot of power to
have over a boy isnt it
it came with the job sir
did torture come with the job
boys were tortured werent they
mr ferguson
define torture
well lets define torture
cigarette burning
random beatings
solitary confinement
with no food and no light
say that took place
on occasion
who tortured them
guards
which guards
i cant remember all of them
remember one
remember one
this line of questioning better lead
somewhere having to do with this case
it will your honor
for your sake
mr ferguson was there ever any sexual
abuse at the wilkinson home for boys
was there ever any sexual abuse
at the wilkinson home for boys
yes i heard that there was
im not asking what you heard
im askingwhat yousaw
please ferguson dont do this
i thought you boys liked it
yes i saw
did you and sean nokes ever
force yourself on any of the boys
did you and sean nokes ever rape
any of the boys at wilkinson home
counselorsapproach
i just fucked your
little friend johnny
counselor what the
hell is going on here
i guess i called the
wrong character witness
counselor ive given you wide latitude
in calling this character witness
now its blown up in your face
please mr ferguson
dont do this please
mr ferguson
please answer the question
mr ferguson sean nokes
i like it nice and slow
visited your home on numerous
occasions is that correct
did you ever leave sean nokes
alone with your child
a child
yes in other words would your
exwife ever leave sean nokes alone
with your child
there would be no reason for that
there would be no reason for him to be
alone with our child it wouldnt come up
never came up
did she ever voice any concern
we have a statement explaining
why she would never allow
sean nokes to be in a
room alone with your son
objection
sustained
you aint gonna touch me ever again
yes
yes
yes what
yes sean nokes had
experiences with some boys
were you there
yes
did you observe these experiences
yes
did you do more than observe
i was drinking then
were there any other guards
around during these experiences
yes
with you and mr nokes
yes
on more than one occasion
yes
mr ferguson do you still think
that sean nokes was a good man
he was my friend
a friend who raped and abused
boys he was paid to look after
i have no further questions
i want this to be over
i want this to be over
witness is excused
mr ferguson
mr ferguson if i were you
l wouldnt stray too far from home
people will want to talk to you
do you understand
michael continued to swim both ends
of the pool at the same time
playing prosecution and defense attorney
he exposed ferguson for what he was
and still kept john and tommys
motive for killing nokes
hidden from the eyes of the court
little caesar who always kept a picture
of his dead brother in his breast pocket
called in the henry addison loan
it was a loan addison couldnt
afford to pay back
and it gave little caesar
the only reason he needed
to even his score for rizzo
davenport wasted little time on
following up on adam styler
he was quickly arrested and charged
with the shooting death
of the queens drug dealer and eight
counts of corruption and bribery
thats six for me two for you
most people play this game
in the summer
its easier to see the ball
without tears in your eyes
i give a fuck about most people
youre gonna have a heart attack
and im not breathing in your mouth
well im not going to marry you either
john and tommy smell something
they just dont know what
a spic be living in the white house by
the time it reaches their fucking brains
snyder came through big
hes not half bad
the way you told it i thought
he could hardly stand up
hes a drunk but hes not a fool
we only win when john and tommy walk
then youll have to get them
out of the shooting hall
you have to put them some place else
and only a witness does that for you
now hes doing a claude rains so far
nobodys seen the fucker
what if he doesnt show what if
we have to go on the way we are
the street is the only one that matters
court is for uptown people
with suits money
lawyers with three names if you
got cash you can buy court justice
but on the street justice has no price
shes blind where the judge sits
but shes not blind out here
out here the bitch got eyes
we need both
then you need a witness
ladies and gentlemen of the jury
you are to disregard
the testimony of ralph ferguson
his entire testimony is
stricken from this record
that concludes the peoples case
your honor
the people rest
the people rest
is the defense ready to proceed
your honor i dont
i dont know
you dont know
well im not sure that
were waiting
900 am tomorrow morning present
a witness or be prepared to sum up
everything good
i found it very interesting
attending morning mass
your honor the defense
calls father robert carillo
father do you know most of
the people in your parish
i know all the people in my parish
do you know the two defendants
john reilly and thomas marcano
how long have you known them
since they were boys
they were both students of mine
remain standing
how long have you been there
itll be twenty years this spring
im a priest
in the case of the people
of the state of new york
against john reilly
and thomas marcano
do you swear the evidence
you are about to give is the truth
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so help you god
i do
acting pastor serve mass daily
listen to confessions
do you recall where you were on the
night of november first this past year
yes i do
where was that
i was at the basketball game at
the garden the knicks vs the celtics
and when did the knicks game begin
about 730
what time did it end
between 930 and 1000
do you remember who won that game
sad to say it was the celtics
kevin mchale and robert parish were
a little too much for our boys that night
even if it was all saints day
next time you give me a call
ill try my guy
ill try that
father carillo
were you at the game alone
no i went there with two friends
and who were those two friends
john reilly and thomas marcano
the two defendants
yes the same two defendants
father carillo at 825 pm
the time the police say
victim sean nokes was murdered
were you still with mr reilly and
mr marcano at the basketball game
yes i was
and what time did you mr reilly
and mr marcano part company
it was around 1030a little later
they dropped me off in front of the
rectory near where theyd picked me up
did the two defendants tell
you where they were going
no they didnt but i imagine
after a night spent with a priest
they went looking for the
first open bar they could find
so then father if the two defendants
were with you at 825
the night of the murder they couldnt
have shot and killed sean nokes
as the prosecution contends
isnt that correct
not unless they shot him from
the blue seats at the garden
he was not shot from there
and he was not shot by those boys
no further questions your honor
your witness mr sullivan
thank you your honor
did you buy the tickets for the game
father or were they given to you
no i bought them
on the day of the game
i went to the box office
about a week before
did anyone know you were going to the
game other than the two defendants
i dont think so
was anyone with you when
you purchased the tickets
no
no one saw you buy the tickets
thats right
did you get a receipt
no i didnt
paid by check
mastercard visa
no i paid by cash
i usually pay for things in cash
you care for the boys in your parish
dont you father
very much
and there isnt anything you
wouldnt do for them am i right
anything in my power to do
i would make it a point
like a father a good father
looking out for one of his sons
something along those lines yes
and is it true then as a good father
you would want to protect them
from something they
shouldnt have done
as much as i would want to protect them
from what someone else said they did
like a murder
yes like a murder
let me get this straight then
no one knew you were going to the game
no one saw you at the game no one
saw you buy tickets for the game
theres no record you even
bought tickets
you have no receipt for the tickets
am i correct
yes thats correct
then how do we really know father
how do we know
you and the two defendants were
at the game on the night of the murder
im telling you as a witness
and as a priest we were at the game
yes as a priest and a priest
wouldnt lie am i right
a priest with ticket stubs
wouldnt need to lie
i always keep the stubs
do you want to see them
why is that father
why do you keep the stubs
because you never know when someone
might want more than your word
has anyone ever questioned
your word before today
no no one ever has but theres
a first time for everything
i have no further questions
thank you father
thank you father
you may step down
ive never recovered from seeing father
bobby take the stand and lie for us
to even the score for john and tommy
he didnt just testify for them
he testified against wilkinsons
and the evil that had lived
there for too long
still i was sorry he had to do it
with respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree
do you find the defendant
john reilly guilty or not guilty
not guilty
with respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree
do you find the defendant thomas
marcano guilty or not guilty
not guilty
thank you very much
