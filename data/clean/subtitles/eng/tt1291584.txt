ive been incredibly passionate about
and as far as where

the dude has three all right
newton the dude says that
for every action
there is an equal and opposite reaction
for example
if kc does not stop the action
of sending texts in class
and tell her posse outside to beat it
then my reaction might be
to send her down to principal zitos office
thus setting the world back
in proper balance

and this is how it affects the monthly
it turns into that
and the total value of the loan
over the life of the loan is that
as you can see thats just the way it is
it puts you upside down
thats the problem
its the county that did the assessment
not the bank
so the numbers are what they are
mr conlon
brendan
the numbers are what they are brendan
i mean youre a math teacher right
you can appreciate that
im a physics teacher i teach physics
physics okay but the bank has got to go

youre upside down on your mortgage
you understand
god you said that like three times
im sorry but i get that
i am asking you
is there something else you can do
not the bank you
can you shift things around restructure
you refinanced twice already

im also showing that you netted
a substantial payout with the refi

i can get you 90 days to get even
ninety days is not enough
my wife and i
we have three jobs between us

have you thought about bankruptcy
its a viable option
theres no shame in this these days

hey tommy where you going
can we stand with jj
hearing the tremendous rush
of the seacrashing boat
the whale wheeled round
to present his blank forehead at bay
but in that evolution catching sight
of the nearing black hull of the ship
seemingly seeing in it
the source of all his persecutions
bethinking it
it may be a larger and nobler foe
of a sudden
he bore down upon its advancing prow
smiting his jaws
amid fiery showers of foam
ahab staggered
his hand smote his forehead
l grow blind
now the only person missing
from the event
was dark horse entry tommy riordan
recent revelations that riordan
was not only a united states marine
but a hero in the iraq wan
has cast an even wider spotlight
on a fighter
who seems to have come out of nowhere
lance corporal mark bradfords
web testimony to riordan
who saved his life earlier this year in iraq
is now spreading like wildfire
throughout the media
tommy
and the bridge just crumbled
tommy come here
come on you got to see this
the amtrac was upside down
and water was coming in from everywhere
and the water pressure was too much
we couldnt get the back hatch open
we were all drowning man
it was a death trap
i couldnt have had more
than another minute
then suddenly
the back ramp gets ripped off
there he was
and before i could get out and thank him
he was gone
he just vanished like a ghost
tom my
tommy did you where you going
taking a walk
tommy
i really just wanted to say thank you
you saved my life brother
and anyone seeing this at sparta
anybody out in pittsburgh

brendan you know

you realize youre supposed to seek
my wise counsel
while schools actually in session right
yes principal z
tell him
okay we wanna use the auditorium
this weekend
to watch mr c in sparta
what do you say
so you want to use the auditorium
to watch a suspended teacher engage
in the activity that he was suspended for
right
am i hearing this correct
right okay we thought you would say that
so it could turn into a fundraiser
you know
you know
i think you need to talk to your parents
because you guys might need
to be in summer school
everybody wants this
come on mr zito
weve been telling everybody
about it already
exactly
and the gyms the only place
thats big enough to fit everyone
look its never gonna happen
what if we get a petition signed
well get the whole school to sign it
the power of democracy
what are they gonna do about that
mr z please
look look you guys i appreciate the fact
that you love your teacher i really do
but there is nothing i can do for you
the roof is about to blow clean off
boardwalk hall arena
it might be fourth of july weekend
but this is christmas eve for fight fans
this is atlantic city
this is the war on the shore
and this is
what everyones been waiting for
sixteen of the baddest men on the planet
duking it out over a 24hour period
for the largest purse
in mixed martial arts history
in the town everyone knows
from the game of monopoly
we got ourselves a winnertakeall affair
buckle your seatbelts roll the dice
and take a ride on the reading
sparta is here
welcome im bryan callen
along with bestselling fight author
sam sheridan
sam when jj riley conceived sparta
he wanted to create quite simply
the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle
in history
5 million bryan 5 million
jj riley put his money where his mouth is
and put up the biggest purse
the sport has ever seen
its unprecedented sam
as is the hoopla surrounding
one tommy riordan the war hero
who has become an overnight sensation
and captured the imagination
and attention
jujitsu black belt francisco barbosa
who has a 19 to four record
in his mixed martial arts career
our rules of the cage are brought to you
by tapout
five minutes paddy
okay
it looks as though the moment of truth
has arrived
because here comes tommy riordan
wow
tommy riordan s
captured the media s attention
but the question still remains
who is this guy
and more importantly
can he compete in this talent pool
can he win
i wish i knew i wish i knew who he was
and i say the fact that i dont know
is very strange
in an internet age
where there are no secrets
this guys a complete mystery
i cant find out anything about him
tommy riordan is officially googleproof
get your hands off me
okay lets go
you gotta love this guy sam
no walkout music
no sponsors no interviews
he skipped the press conference
wouldnt have his picture taken
for the program
hes breaking every rule
the only reason really
that tommy riordan is in this tournament
is an mma video making the rounds of him
beating up mad dog grimes in the gym
but the reason
that a lot of his fans are in the stands
is because of another video
its even more stunning
than the mad dog grimes video
this guy let me describe it to you folks
for the few that havent seen it
and i dont know anybody who hasnt
but tommy riordan ripped the door
off a tank
in the heat of battle
saving lives in the process
and then walked away
without claiming a medal
listen
he ripped the door off a tank
tommy riordan is a genuine war hero
im not taking anything away from the guy
hes a very very tough guy
but the tank dont hit back you know
sam
weve seen youtube sensations fail
on a big stage before
sam he ripped the door off a tank
tommy riordan
he has definitely got his hands full
in his first opponent francisco barbosa
francisco barbosa
hes nothing to scoff at
yeah hes the octopus hes the real deal
hes a very very tough guy
a very highcaliber fighter
now tommy riordan came out of nowhere
and i d imagine hes gonna disappear
just as quickly
its a great story
but i think your boy
is gonna be exposed here
as a youtube sensation
well well
a lot of fans here in boardwalk hall
hope youre wrong sam

jj riley only had 48 hours
less than 48 hours to fill the spot
and basically he had to go on the road
to frank campana

which is really something
i dont understand
i just im shocked
hey brendan brendan go get him
go good luck
lets go brendan
you go get him son
you know i can understand
coming out to no music
but why in the world would you choose
classical music as your entrance
this is beethoven
this is ode to joy bryan
my apologies mr renaissance man
go get him son
if you wanna talk about renaissance men
you gotta talk about frank campana
very unorthodox trainer
but one of the best trainers in the game
and hes well known for using classical
music to teach his fighters to remain calm
to remain patient
and to remain composed under pressure
you know ill tell you classical music
is about as fitting to this setting
as brendan conlon is to this tournament
come on
in fact let me show you something
right here let me tell you
what
you see that right there

that my friend is brendan conlon
okay brendan conlons about

come on give the guy a break
you know the guy
at least weve seen him fight
i mean hes fought real guys
hes been in the ufc
we remember him from that
i remember him too
i remember him being very unmemorable
midnight le getting ready
to climb into the cage and go to work
when the brackets were announced
he thought hed be going up
against marco santos
hes got to be thrilled to be seeing
brendan conlon across from him
hey you asked for it
brendan retired from fighting
some years ago
hes actually
a high school physics teacher now
and midnight had some fun with that
at the press conference yesterday
well he said he was going to give
the teacher a serious lesson
and that getting killed was no way
to spend a summer vacation
midnight is known for talking trash
hes also known for backing it up
no question bryan
hes in a lot of trouble here
midnight le is an agent of destruction

he did it he did it he did it he did it
way to go brendan way to go yeah
this is whats so great
about mixed martial arts
theres so many ways to lose
one tiny miscalculation
anyone can win at anytime
which is probably why frank campanas
embracing his man
and i honestly dont think either
one of them can believe what just happened
great show of sportsmanship here
from the teacher
well thats a hallmark
of frank campanas philosophy
something all his fighters buy into
and obviously none more so than brendan
and midnight le is shocked
he thought hed get a free pass
into the second round
but instead hes going home
dominated the fight the entire way
but he falls prey to a very technical finish
a very technical finish but thats a fluke
i dont care what anybody says that is a
i dont know
you can call it a fluke but im gonna call it
a guy maintaining composure
and waiting for his opportunity
conlon beats midnight unbelievable
i hope you got a receipt for your goldfish
yes
okay

and soon to be seven
as koba prepares to go to work
for the second time tonight

you got to be kidding me im afraid
he might have broken something else
thats certainly possible
koba moving on to tomorrow night

mad dog fighting like a man possessed
like a man with something to prove
reminding everyone why he is a
serious contender to win this whole contest

the teacher miraculously
passed his first test
but now hes got to face the dane
brendan you can do it
halfway through round three now
and the beating continues

can take this kind of punishment
he has been battered without mercy
in both of his fights today
