the super bowl of mixed martial arts 
and he decided to put up
the  5 million purse  too

the third law   
how many laws this dude got 
 the dude 
 yes  the dude 
the dude has three  all right 
newton  the dude  says that
for every action 
there is an equal and opposite reaction 
for example 
if k c  does not stop the action
of sending texts in class
and tell her posse outside to beat it 
then my reaction might be
to send her down to principal zito s office 
thus setting the world back
in proper balance 
mr  c  i put it away 
all right  before you go 
i have your tests from last week 
just work it out 
stop downing

 come on  dog 
cover up  damn it 
you owe me 200 bucks 
this one here 
see  this is the new appraisal figures
 that came in 
 yeah 
and this is how it affects the monthly 
it turns into that 
and the total value of the loan 
over the life of the loan  is that 
as you can see  that s just the way it is 
it puts you upside down 
that s the problem 
it s the county that did the assessment 
not the bank 
so  the numbers are what they are 
mr  conlon   
 brendan 
 the numbers are what they are  brendan 
i mean  you re a math teacher  right 
you can appreciate that 
i m a physics teacher  i teach physics 
physics  okay  but the bank has got to go
by the new appraisal figures 
and  according to these figures 
you re upside down on your mortgage 
 you understand 
 god  you said that like three times 
i m sorry  but i get that 
i am asking you 
is there something else you can do 
not the bank  you 
can you shift things around  restructure 
you refinanced twice already 
 cause you advised us to do that 
 you told me 
 well  i presented you with that option 
but that was your choice 
i m also showing that you netted
a substantial payout with the refi 
we had that conversation 
i was paying medical bills 
oh  right  sorry  your daughter s kidney 
 heart 
 heart  right  sorry 
a lot of stories 
all right  so  if that s my option 
i have no options 
you re not even gonna try and help me 
you re not even gonna try 
no  i m trying  look  brendan 
i can get you 90 days to get even 
ninety days is not enough 
my wife and i 
we have three jobs between us 
and that doesn t cut it 
so  what do you suggest 
well  let me ask you a question 
have you thought about bankruptcy 
it s a viable option 
there s no shame in this these days 
that s not how i do things 
okay  well  then

 press conference will start in 20 minutes 
 okay 
brendan  you re gonna be sitting up
on the stage 
tommy 
hey  tommy  where you going 
can we stand with j j  
 hearing the tremendous rush
of the sea crashing boat 
 the whale wheeled round
to present his blank forehead at bay 
 but in that evolution  catching sight
of the nearing black hull of the ship 
 seemingly seeing in it
the source of all his persecutions 
 bethinking it 
it may be a larger and nobler foe 
 of a sudden 
he bore down upon its advancing prow 
 smiting his jaws
amid fiery showers of foam 
 ahab staggered 
his hand smote his forehead 
  l grow blind      
now  the only person missing
from the event
was dark horse entry  tommy riordan
recent revelations that riordan
was not only a united states marine 
but a hero in the iraq wan
has cast an even wider spotlight
on a fighter
who seems to have come out of nowhere 
lance corporal mark bradford s
web testimony to riordan 
who saved his life earlier this year in iraq 
is now spreading like wildfire
throughout the media 
tommy 
and the bridge just crumbled 
tommy  come here 
come on  you got to see this 
the amtrac was upside down
and water was coming in from everywhere 
and the water pressure was too much 
we couldn t get the back hatch open 
we were all drowning  man 
it was a death trap 
i couldn t have had more
than another minute 
then suddenly 
the back ramp gets ripped off
there he was 
and before i could get out and thank him 
he was gone 
 he just vanished like a ghost 
 tom my 
 tommy  did you    where you going 
 taking a walk 
tommy 
i really just wanted to say thank you 
you saved my life  brother
and anyone seeing this at sparta 
anybody out in pittsburgh 
you reach out to tommy riordan
and tell him mark said   thank you  
footage taken from a helmet cam

and what i hear 
he means nothing to you  either 
you got balls talking about forgiveness 
that has nothing to do with forgiveness 
i got children  man  i got a family to protect

you forgave us 
yeah 
well  i m not surprised

you re not the only one
that suffered  tommy 
i didn t even know she was sick 
i never even got the chance to say goodbye
to my own mother

that was not your decision to make 
you know what 
you walk around

brendan  you know

my wise counsel
while school s actually in session  right 
 yes  principal z 
 tell him 
okay  we wanna use the auditorium
this weekend
to watch mr  c in sparta 
what do you say 
so  you want to use the auditorium
to watch a suspended teacher engage
in the activity that he was suspended for 
 right 
 am i hearing this correct 
right  okay  we thought you would say that 
so it could turn into a fundraiser 
you know 
you know 
i think you need to talk to your parents 
because you guys might need
to be in summer school 
 everybody wants this 
 come on  mr  zito 
we ve been telling everybody
about it already 
 exactly 
 and the gym s the only place
 that s big enough to fit everyone 
 look  it s never gonna happen 
 what if we get a petition signed 
 we ll get the whole school to sign it 
 the power of democracy 
 what are they gonna do about that 
mr  z  please 
look  look  you guys  i appreciate the fact
that you love your teacher  i really do 
but there is nothing i can do for you 
the roof is about to blow clean off
boardwalk hall arena 
it might be fourth of july weekend 
but this is christmas eve for fight fans 
this is atlantic city 
this is the war on the shore 
and this is
what everyone s been waiting for
sixteen of the baddest men on the planet
duking it out over a 24 hour period
for the largest purse
in mixed martial arts history 
in the town everyone knows
from the game of monopoly 
we got ourselves a winner take all affair
buckle your seatbelts  roll the dice 
and take a ride on the reading 
sparta is here 
welcome  i m bryan callen 
along with bestselling fight author 
sam sheridan 
sam  when j j  riley conceived sparta 
he wanted to create  quite simply 
the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle
in history 
 5 million  bryan   5 million 
j j  riley put his money where his mouth is
and put up the biggest purse
the sport has ever seen 
it s unprecedented  sam 
as is the hoopla surrounding
one tommy riordan  the war hero 
who has become an overnight sensation
and captured the imagination
and attention   
   jujitsu black belt francisco barbosa 
who has a 19 to four record
in his mixed martial arts  career
our rules of the cage are brought to you
by tapout 
 five minutes  paddy 
 okay 
it looks as though the moment of truth
has arrived 
 because here comes tommy riordan 
 wow 
tommy riordan  s
captured the media  s attention 
but the question still remains 
who is this guy 
and more importantly 
can he compete in this talent pool 
can he win 
i wish i knew  i wish i knew who he was 
and i say the fact that i don t know
is very strange 
in an internet age
where there are no secrets 
this guy s a complete mystery 
i can t find out anything about him 
tommy riordan is officially google proof 
get your hands off me 
okay  let s go 
you gotta love this guy  sam 
no walk out music 
no sponsors  no interviews 
he skipped the press conference 
wouldn t have his picture taken
for the program 
he s breaking every rule 
the only reason  really 
that tommy riordan is in this tournament
is an mma video making the rounds of him
beating up mad dog grimes in the gym 
but the reason
that a lot of his fans are in the stands
is because of another video 
it s even more stunning
than the mad dog grimes video 
this guy    let me describe it to you  folks 
for the few that haven t seen it 
and i don t know anybody who hasn t 
but tommy riordan ripped the door
off a tank
in the heat of battle 
saving lives in the process 
and then walked away
without claiming a medal 
 listen   
 he ripped the door off a tank 
tommy riordan is a genuine war hero 
i m not taking anything away from the guy 
he s a very  very tough guy 
 but the tank don t hit back  you know 
 sam   
we ve seen youtube sensations fail
on a big stage before 
sam  he ripped the door off a tank 
tommy riordan 
he has definitely got his hands full
in his first opponent  francisco barbosa 
 francisco barbosa   
 he s nothing to scoff at 
yeah  he s the octopus  he s the real deal 
he s a very  very tough guy 
a very high caliber fighter 
now  tommy riordan came out of nowhere 
and i  d imagine he s gonna disappear
just as quickly 
it s a great story 
but i think your boy
is gonna be exposed here
 as a youtube sensation 
 well  well 
a lot of fans here in boardwalk hall
hope you re wrong  sam 
all right  gentlemen 
you ve been given your instructions 
i expect a clean fight 
obey my command at all times 
defend yourselves at all times 
touch gloves  go back  let s do this 
tommy  cut off the corners

 and here we go 
 you ready 
let s go to war 
keep your focus  tom 
and here we go  we re gonna see this 
barbosa s gonna be looking for a takedown 
he s definitely looking for a takedown here 
barbosa is down 
barbosa has been knocked out 
tommy riordan is most definitely for real 
and now he s walking out of the cage 
he s leaving the cage 
hey  tommy 
there goes another rule  out the window 
where you going 
francisco barbosa is out cold 
and he is out of this tournament  bryan 
 a huge left hook  launching

yeah 
yeah 
j j  riley only had 48 hours 
less than 48 hours  to fill the spot 
and basically  he had to go on the road
to frank campana 
well  then he chose brendan conlon 
which is really something
i don t understand 
i just    i m shocked 
hey  brendan  brendan  go get him 
go  good luck 
let s go  brendan 
you go get him  son 
you know  i can understand
coming out to no music 
but why in the world would you choose
classical music as your entrance 
this is beethoven 
this is ode to joy  bryan 
my apologies  mr  renaissance man 
go get him  son 
if you wanna talk about renaissance men 
you gotta talk about frank campana 
very unorthodox trainer 
but one of the best trainers in the game 
and he s well known for using classical
music to teach his fighters to remain calm 
to remain patient 
and to remain composed under pressure 
you know  i ll tell you  classical music
is about as fitting to this setting
as brendan conlon is to this tournament 
 come on 
 in fact  let me show you something 
right here  let me tell you   
 what 
 you see that  right there 
that  right there   
that  my friend  is brendan conlon 
okay  brendan conlon s about
to be dropped into a shark tank 
he s a feeder fish 
come on  give the guy a break 
you know  the guy   
at least we ve seen him fight 
i mean  he s fought real guys 
he s been in the ufc 
 we remember him from that 
 i remember him  too 
i remember him being very unmemorable 
midnight le getting ready
to climb into the cage and go to work 
when the brackets were announced 
he thought he d be going up
against marco santos 
he s got to be thrilled to be seeing
brendan conlon across from him 
hey  you asked for it 
brendan retired from fighting
some years ago 
he s actually
a high school physics teacher now 
and midnight had some fun with that
at the press conference yesterday 
well  he said he was going to give
the teacher a serious lesson 
and that getting killed was no way
to spend a summer vacation 
midnight is known for talking trash 
he s also known for backing it up 
no question  bryan 
he s in a lot of trouble here 
 midnight le is an agent of destruction 
 gentlemen 
go get him 
all right  guys 
you ve been given your instructions 
i expect a clean fight 
obey my commands at all times 
defend yourselves at all times 
touch gloves  go back  let s do this 
go have some fun  baby 
gentlemen  you ready 
you ready  let s go to war 
work your kicks 
come on  brendan  come on

 and now  he s got the hooks in 
 the hooks are in 
 brendan in very big trouble 
 the end is close

 come on 
   and conlon s face is turning purple 
this looks like it s over

 conlon showing signs of life

brendan conlon is going

slow down  relax  you got it  you got it 
and this isn t    this isn t happening

yeah  yeah  he tapped him out 
honey  he tapped him out 
he did it  he did it  he did it  he did it 
way to go  brendan  way to go  yeah 
this is what s so great
about mixed martial arts 
there s so many ways to lose 
one tiny miscalculation 
anyone can win at anytime 
which is probably why frank campana s
embracing his man 
and i honestly don t think either
one of them can believe what just happened 
great show of sportsmanship here
from the teacher 
well  that s a hallmark
of frank campana s philosophy 
something all his fighters buy into 
and  obviously  none more so than brendan 
and midnight le is shocked 
he thought he d get a free pass
into the second round 
but  instead  he s going home 
dominated the fight the entire way 
but he falls prey to a very technical finish 
a very technical finish  but that s a fluke 
 i don t care what anybody says  that is a   
 i don t know 
you can call it a fluke  but i m gonna call it
a guy maintaining composure
and waiting for his opportunity 
conlon beats midnight  unbelievable 
i hope you got a receipt for your goldfish 
yes 
okay 
we  re down to eight fighters 
and soon to be seven 
as koba prepares to go to work
for the second time tonight 
 right hand 
 huge right hand 
 huge right hand 
 oh  my goodness 
oh  my god  this is over 
once again  koba does not break a sweat 
you got to be kidding me  i m afraid
he might have broken something else 
that s certainly possible 
koba moving on to tomorrow night 
 koba  koba 
 koba  koba 
mad dog fighting like a man possessed 
like a man with something to prove 
reminding everyone why he is a
serious contender to win this whole contest 
he wanted to send a message to
tommy riordan  and there it is  right there 
here comes the underdog  brendan conlon 
the teacher miraculously
passed his first test 
but now he s got to face the dane 
brendan  you can do it 
halfway through round three  now 
and the beating continues 
i honestly don t know how brendan conlon
can take this kind of punishment 
he has been battered without mercy
 in both of his fights today 
 relax  you re okay 
he s still standing  bryan 
beethoven 
no  no  no  no

mad dog grimes has been
waiting for revenge
ever since the day tommy riordan
walked into his gym in pittsburgh
and turned his life upside down 
it s been a very long and very miserable
few months for mad dog  to say the least

a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight

 well  here we go 
 he s like a machine  look at him 
gentlemen  you ready 
you ready  let s go to war

keep moving  keep moving 
get away from him 
hit him  babe  hit him  get in there 
 crushing body shots

like a side of beef 
go  go  go  get up 
he s getting his ass whooped 
and now he s got him in the air 
oh  god

i think campana has to think
seriously about   
 how much abuse can one man take 
    continuing another round of this 
go to war 
just relax  relax  relax  off the fence 
brendan s going for a ride 
that one shook the entire building 
man  he just threw him against the fence
like a rag doll

hold on  turn it in  turn in 
and now he s on top  koba s on top 
and he s finishing him  here  look at this 
on the edge of blowing it 
get off the fence  brendan 
you wonder how conlon can
take this kind of beating on his arms 
 his forearms and his hands 
 drop that neck 
how much can one man take 
break  break  break 
everybody has got to be
a little bit concerned
about brendan conlon s bravery
getting him in trouble here 
his bravery could get him killed  frankly 
and by the way 
he s got nothing more to prove 
 he s lasted two rounds with koba
 that s true  that s true 
and you wonder what s keeping this guy up 
sit down  sit down 
breathe  breathe 
look at me  look at me 
wait up  small sips  hold it 
hold it  small sips 
why are we here 
why are we here  brendan

but the russian s back up 
brendan shoots him again 
pressing him against the cage 
 yes

the tables have turned and the boy scout

the teacher springing off the fence and
going for a mountain 
 but koba s on his feet 
 get up  get up

on the ground with brendan
