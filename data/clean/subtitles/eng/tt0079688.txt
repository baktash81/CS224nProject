good morning 
i want to talk to you all this morning
about a shocking incident   
   which occurred yesterday
when some students   
   who might possibly even go
to this school   
   caused a major traffic
accident on the freeway 
because of this  the school board
has decided on the following steps   
   to stop this kind of thing
from going any further 
smoking on or near school grounds
will result in immediate suspension 
mr  white  you re late 
why are you late  richard 
i had to take a piss 
what 
  i mean  i had to urinate 
  sit down 
now  there will be a 9 30
curfew starting tonight   
   and it will be strictly enforced
by the police department 
i hope that s clear 
we have a film that we would like you
to see  and then mr  cole   
   who is president of
the homeowner s association   
   has a few announcements 
 y i vandalism is one of our country s
 y i biggest problems today 
 y i estimates for destruction
 y i to school facilities alone   
 y i     is over   100 million per year 
 y i and counting all acts of vandalism
 y i to public and private property   
 y i     some experts push the figure
 y i to over   1 billion every year 
 y i a  vandal  is defined
 y i as one who willfully   
 y i     wantonly  and ignorantly damages   
 y i     and destroys valuable
 y i or beautiful things 
oh  no  so destructive  look 
 y i maybe you re mad at the school 
 y i but busting something doesn t help

in front of the cop 
the cop has as much brains as a damn ant 
i asserted myself  and i said   
   as a salesman  i have good
instincts as a salesman 
i said   jerry  i don t think these guys
from out of town   
   care about the property 
they re not interested 
they re in las vegas writing it off  
you know what he says 
he says   how are the caddies selling  
you think that i enjoyed
being humiliated like that 
no  goddamn it  if he had done such
a good job on those guys from houston   
   they wouldn t have got scared 
two kids  three    i don t know
how many kids  scared them out of town 
i know it sounds wrong 
but i m sure jerry knows   
jerry cole doesn t know anything

  he s an idiot 
  carl  where have you been 
i was just out 
carl 
come over here  i want to talk to you 
it s okay  honey  it s okay 
sit down 
what is it 
i had a talk with sergeant doberman 
i had to sit while he warned me
about keeping you in line   
   or i d find myself in juvenile court 
  what  doberman said what 
  i m not finished 
i saw you at that rec yesterday
when that boy was arrested 
oh  i know you did 
i ll bet you and jerry cole   
   had doberman bust the rec
on purpose  huh 
is that what you think

of hash in claude zachary s pocket 
  do you  you think that too 
  it wasn t an ounce  dad 
  how do you know so much about it 
  did i get busted 
oh  shit 
fred  let s just discuss this quietly 
it s not necessarily carl s fault
that claude   
it s never his fault 
it s always his friends  fault  right 
his friends with the knives  the drugs 
but those friends of yours are going to
reform school  and you re not gonna follow 
who s going to reform school 
jesus christ 
carl  we don t want you to see
your friend richie white for a while

the teen center is gonna be closed
for a while   
   at least until they can find
a new counselor

she can t control the wilder kids 
bullshit

i said  don t leave when we re
talking to you 
  fred  stop that

and the fern needs a lot of water   
   yet they can live together
in the same environment 
  sometimes   
  stop talking 
  alan  what are you doing 
  nothing 
if tomorrow were the last day of the rest
of your life  would you do nothing 
  i don t wanna think about that 
  what do you want to think about 
i don t know 
maybe just having a good time 
carl  go to the botany box

and i fell asleep 
when i heard about it 
i thought about you right away 
i mean  i only knew him with you 
he still had the gun with him  didn t he 
yeah 
i think finding that gun was an omen 
so does abby 
what do you mean 
just that it s weird  us finding it   
   then running into you guys 
i know 
what were you gonna do 
i don t remember 
i told him to get rid of the gun
when doberman started chasing us   
   but he wouldn t do it 
i knew it was gonna happen 
the first day i ever met him he said 
 hi  i m richie white  i m on probation  
what are you gonna do 
i don t know  i m scared 
i ll go home  i guess  but not right away 
i m glad you came

  carl 
carl  we re your parent   
honey  we re your parents 
all we re trying to do is to protect you 
carl  sandy 
carl  let me in here immediately  carl 
carl  we re sorry 
we all lost our heads the other night 
what s carl doing here 
  look 
  that s carl 
oh  my god  it s carl 
  hey  carl  what s going down 
  hey  what happened 
hi 
lincoln  the gun 
i don t know what s wrong with him 
sure  ed  the gun  ed 
the public relations  ed 
how you doing  soldier 
tonight we re here to talk about a problem
that has been with new granada   
   since its incorporation 
youth crime 
that is to say  youth discipline 
i think it would be a mistake for us
to tell ourselves   
   that yesterday s tragic event
was an isolated incident 
all of us who are parents
know what it s like   
   to wait up for a child who s out late 
to wait for the phone to ring   
   and then when it does 
to be a little afraid to answer it 
  hey  it s claude 
  claude 
good to meet you  claude 
  hey  man  are you all right 
  yeah 
  your parents get mad at you 
  ah  the usual 
same old thing  you know 
you think doberman will get fired 
ah  hell  fire him 
they ll give him a medal 
yeah  he s gonna make
a big speech tonight   
   and tell how he shot richie
in self defense 
  yeah 
  it s all a bunch of crap 
  right 
  yeah 
  and all our parents are there to hear it 
  and there ain t nothing we can do about it 
we should go down there
and tell them all to go to hell 
everybody who s ever messed with me
in one room 
that d be just about everybody in town 
thank you 
first of all   
   i certainly expected to see
a few more people here tonight 
as a matter of fact 
this turnout is really pathetic 
i wonder where all those parents are 
what are they doing that s so important 
if the death of a 14 year old boy won t
get them away from their television sets   
   for a meeting like this 
i don t think anything will 
it s that kind of apathy that got us
into this mess in the first place   
   as i think we all know 
at least  those of us who did bother
to show up at this meeting tonight 
well  i guess we all realize   
   it s time for some tough talk
about the kids in this city 
man  one stick of dynamite would do it 
i don t know how many of us
are willing to admit   
   just how deep in trouble
some of the kids in this city are 
i don t know how many of you know it 
but right here in new granada   
   we ve got one of the highest rates
of vandalism in the state 
in a few moments 
sergeant doberman is going to tell us   
   some of the recommendations
of the police department   
   a few measures for dealing with
the problem and preventing future tragedies 
as we all know  new granada is a   
a unique place 
that s why we ve all chosen to live here 
people don t move into
a planned community   
   to be pushed around
and scared to go out at night 
they come here to get away
from that sort of thing 
and if we re asking them to move here 
then we owe them that security 
now  this isn t just
a new granada problem 
i ve talked to city managers and councilmen
and mayors all over the country   
   and heard that same stuff about the kids
over and over again 
so it isn t as if new granada
is some kind of a freak   
   but we are right on the firing line   
   and we ve gotta
meet this problem head on 
we aren t anywhere near our growth factor
in our master plan this year   
   and if we don t grow 
we don t succeed 
now  you think about it 
just the other day 
i passed by the supreme 
i can remember when that was
our finest apartment house 
three hundred units 
spacious  decorated  electric kitchens   
where you going 
you leaving 
what 
i deeply regret what happened yesterday 
no one wants to shoot a kid 
this is the last thing that any police officer
wants to happen to him in the line of duty 
i did not come here to apologize 
i am sorry 
sorry that he was carrying a handgun 
sorry that he was on drugs 
any other kids in there 
there s no way for a kid on drugs
to learn anything 
a kid in the classroom on drugs 
that classroom does not exist for him 
there is no way for a kid on drugs
to grow up 
so i m sorry about richie white and his
friends pushing pills and pot and angel dust 
the first thing we ve got to do
is have an early curfew   
   and the second thing we have to do
is close down the places   
   where they ve been
selling these drugs 
and we took an important step
in that direction yesterday   
   when we closed down the teen center 
sergeant  is it true that richie white s gun
wasn t loaded 
  when somebody points a gun at you   
  answer the question  was the gun loaded 
well  how the hell
was i supposed to know  
i don t even think he knew 
that kid was violent  wild  you never knew
what he was gonna do next 
  come on 
  all he did was hang around that rec center 
and i think you ve got some things
to answer for yourself 
you have contributed to the problem
of these teenagers 
all i have done to these teenagers
is listen to them 
somebody s got a handgun   
if i see a person carrying a handgun 
he better have a goddamn good reason 
yeah  like you do  right 
miss vogel  please  now  please 
just    everybody needs to calm down
here for a minute 
i know you ve been under a strain  ed 
i appreciate your concern 
we re all concerned here 
but i think we ve gotten away
from the main point   
   which is that a community
with a juvenile crime problem   
   is not a community
with a high property value 
i am interested in the health
of this community 
ed  it s okay  it s okay 
you can have the finest housing
in the world  and we do   
   but nobody s gonna pay 80    100 000
to live in a decorator colored slum 
jerry  can i ask you a question 
what the hell are you talking about 
what do you mean 
i m talking about the problem 
yeah  but which problem 
the problem with the kids   
   or the problem with resale values 
what makes you think if you shut
the rec down or you put a curfew on kids   
   the problem s gonna fly away 
  now  i know you ve been upset lately 
  that s right  i m goddamn upset 
my son ran away  and i don t know
where he is tonight  i m upset 
your son and some of his friends
are part of this problem 
goddamn it  jerry  my son and his friends
are part of this goddamn town 
and you people talk about these kids
like they re animals running in the street 
have you sat down
and talked to your kids 
  has anyone talked to these kids 
  i talk to them 
i talk to them six hours a day
until i m blue in the face 
i spend more time with your kids
than you people do 
you think those kids are interested
in learning 
come in and see what goes on
in a classroom 
but no  when we have open school week 
nobody comes 
and that includes you  mr  willat 
why is everybody pointing fingers
at these kids 
what  are they all rotten  and we re good 
what is it  what s going on 
  i don t think jerry meant we don t care   
  the problem is jerry does not care 
i think it s highly inappropriate for us   
eat it  you stinking pig 
we ve got a situation out here 
keep these people calm 
people  people  people 
we seem to have a situation here 
please be quiet    get on the door 
we ve got a situation   
sergeant doberman will be right back 
that s your goddamn kid out there 
mr  willat 
i know the door s locked 
we got a minor situation out here 
all the doors are locked 
your kids have locked us in 
all right  please 
i know how we can handle it 
you people got me acting crazy
