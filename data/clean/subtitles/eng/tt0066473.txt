the kind of leader we need 
he believes in the value
of the airplane 
but why a vice navy minister
for such an important position 
maybe the climate in tokyo was
detrimental to yamamoto s health 
the army is against him for
opposing their policies 
so he runs away to sea  now he
has the entire fleet to guard him 
 both speak in japanese 
this order makes you
commander in chief 
the imperial fleet consists of  
save your breath  yoshida 
those details are in the documents 
you haven t changed 
with the army controlling politics   
   your job as navy minister
will be difficult 
thank god you re here 
we know your life
has been threatened 
i m not that easy to kill 
army hotheads are demanding
an alliance with germany 
that would be tragic for japan 
as navy minister i will   
   continue to fight with the army 
you are our last hope  yoshida 
the navy must stand firm
against the alliance 
america is against the war
we are waging in china   
   and angry that we are
negotiating with the germans 
now we are threatened with an embargo
of the raw materials we need 
either we improve relations with the u s 
and withdraw from china   
   or find another source of
raw materials here in indo china 
why worry about threats
from america 
president roosevelt s attention
is on europe   
   where germany is winning a
quick victory over the allied armies 
now is the time to strike 
the british  the dutch and the french
are withdrawing their forces   
   from southeast asia to
strengthen their armies in europe 
we must be careful 
the americans have an army
in the philippines   
   and they have moved their pacific
fleet from san diego to pearl harbor 
yes  and that fleet is a knife
leveled at japan s throat 
the japanese ambassador just arrived 
he should be up shortly 
thank you 
the japanese are stalling  henry 
you know that 
when nomura took over as ambassador   
   i had some hopes of settling
our differences 
but our meetings so far
have been unproductive 
he brings me proposals 
i offer compromises 
he brings me counterproposals 
and so on 
i tell you  henry 
nomura was sent here to buy time 
that s what he s doing 
at our expense 
the president believes him
to be a man of honor   
   that we can trust and deal with 
mr  ambassador  we meet again 
it is always a pleasure 
i assume you know mr  stimson 
the head of our war department 
oh  yes  of course 
mr  ambassador 
i do hope  mr  stimson   
   your presence here
does not indicate anything ominous 
of course not  mr  nomura 
mr  nomura  won t you please sit down 
thank you 
well  since our last talk
a week ago   
   i have received certain   
   shall we say   
   questions from my government   
   to put to you
to clarify certain matters 
good morning  colonel 
there it is 
this machine lets us intercept
every word between tokyo   
   and all japanese embassies 
kramer  the coded material is fed
into that machine 
it goes round and round in there   
   and comes out here 
decoded in japanese 
all we have to do is translate it 
we decode this quicker than
the japanese embassy   
   right here in washington 
no wonder you decided to call it
 operation magic  
  the latest intercept  sir 
  thank you 
things are getting a little
hotter in the pacific 
as long as we re sharing
this assignment   
   take a look at this 
behold the 12 apostles 
the chosen few are authorized
to see the magic intercepts 
hap arnold  chief of the air corps 
isn t on the list 
no  and not one of our
overseas commanders 
 speaks in japanese 
excellent 
 man shouting in japanese 
who is in command of
those torpedo planes 
lt  commander fuchida  sir 
from the carrier akagi 
send him this message from me 
 congratulations on brilliant
torpedo attack  
if we are forced into
a war with america   
   japan s only hope   
   is to annihilate the american pacific
fleet at the outset 
i wonder if we could use
torpedo planes at pearl harbor 
stand by 
execute 
 band plays  star spangled banner  
look at that entrance to the harbor 
sink one good sized ship in the channel
and you ve bottled up our whole fleet 
you know as well as i do 
this harbor is a mousetrap 
fleet should have stayed
in san diego where it belongs 
i made the mistake to point
that out to roosevelt 
we re expected to obey orders 
we re also expected to exercise
our own good judgment 
i didn t ask for the job 
sorry  kim  but this was my command 
and it s become habit   
   to worry about the security
of the fleet 
the british  flying some
old biplanes   
   torpedoed and sank three italian
battleships at taranto 
  harbor very much like this one 
  well   
   i share your concern  but cno
doesn t think it can happen here 
why not 
a torpedo dropped
from a plane plunges   
   to a depth of 75 feet or more
before it levels off 
i know  and pearl is only
40 feet deep 
i m still worried  kim 
frankly  sir  i was stunned
when i heard of your proposal 
you think the plan is reckless 
you suggest using torpedo planes
against the american fleet   
   but pearl harbor is
too shallow for that 
taranto is also a shallow harbor   
   but the british torpedoed and sank
three italian battleships there 
i know as well as you do
that my plan is a gamble 
and it s risky 
but we have no choice 
what i need immediately is
a plan for such an attack 
then we should consult with genda   
   the new air staff officer on the akagi 
a superb strategist 
yes  i remember genda 
we ll talk to him 
 crowd shouting in japanese 
glad to see you  genda 
so this is the new zero 
type 21  with folding wings 
this means we can carry
more fighters now 
this zero is fast  maneuverable
and has a long cruising range 
better than the messerschmitt
or spitfire 
definitely  i ve seen both
in combat over london 
you outrank me  so it must be true 
now that you re staff officer here 
things will be tough 
you don t have to worry 
you won t be here 
you re going to the third fleet
with a promotion 
the commander in chief
must think you re good 
of course he does 
and i ve got proof 
here is his telegram 
want to read it 
 indistinct radio chatter 
ten hut 
do the planes have to be
parked like that 
way at the edge of the field 
farthing 
standard dispersal procedure  general 
in case of enemy air attack 
there are 130 000 japanese
on this island 
our main problem is sabotage 
it d be too easy for enemies
to sneak in at night   
   and blow up every one of them
if they re left out there 
make a note  fielder 
we ll have to make changes 
yes  sir 
ten hut 
 intercom buzzes 
  yes 
aide  admiral halsey s here to see you 
send him in  please 
blast me  break me  court martial me 
draw and quarter me   
   if you think they re gonna
send my ships   
   on convoy duty in the atlantic 
kim  i think they ve
gone nuts in washington 
how will i fight
a task force if they send   
   my ships to the atlantic 
that damn ocean is a swimming hole
compared to the pacific 
what are we  a fighting fleet 
or are these toy boats out here   
   so the japs
can buy them at christmas 
all right  bill  now ease it off 
it s not just you 
they asked for some
of our tankers too 
how do they expect to feed
these wagons   
   parked out here on
this land locked duck pond 
you re still planning on rotating
half of them at sea 
i was 
look  kim  you ve got to make them
understand what s going on out here 
i m gonna do everything i can  bill 
even go to the president 
by god  i knew there was
at least one man   
   in this man s navy
who hadn t gone nuts 
 speaks in japanese 
 gandhi  is still in hiding  sir 
a strange man  he works in his
cabin like a hermit 
but he should be here 
watanabe  go and ask him
to join us 
when  gandhi  concentrates on
a plan  he is lost to this world 
 gandhi speaks in japanese 
please don t bother me 
this is important   
   so i m not going 
genda s plan for attacking
pearl harbor   
   is foolproof  it s brilliant 
he stresses the importance
of combat aircraft 
just think of it 
we use six aircraft carriers   
   torpedo planes   
   high level bombers  dive bombers 
zero fighters for cover   
   go by the northern route 
use the new torpedoes   
   we attack on a weekend 
genda has thought of everything   
   refueling   
   the weather    
and we go on to say 
 it should be noted that japan   
   has never preceded hostile action
by a declaration of war 
we have concluded it possible
that a fast rated   
   japanese carrier force may arrive
in hawaii with no prior warning   
   from our intelligence service 
the most favorable time
to the enemy would be dawn 
he probably would employ
a maximum of six carriers   
   strike on a weekend 
  we recommend that the air corps   
  i read it 
yes  sir 
i appreciate the work that you
and general martin have put in 
kimmel  these reports are very useful
to general short and myself 
general martin  you don t pull
any punches  do you 
 we recommend that the air corps   
   maintain a thorough
360 degree search   
   of the hawaiian area
during daylight 
this will require a force of
180 b 17 airplanes  
we can t search the sea approaches   
   unless we have the planes  sir 
one hundred and eighty b 17s 
for god s sakes  that s more than
the number existing in the states 
it looks fine on paper  but that s
not a paper fleet out there 
squadron from the enterprise 
bill halsey s working
the tails off his men 
kimmel 
wish we had more like him 
makes the most of what he s got 
doesn t keep asking for the moon 
well  not one bomb anywhere
near the target for the past hour 
your pilots can see it  i suppose 
  who s next 
  it s anderson  sir 
now  that s more like it 
  maybe your boys finally get it 
  i hope so  sir 
who s next 
lieutenant dickenson 
tell lieutenant dickenson for me   
   he couldn t hit a bull
in the butt with a bass fiddle 
yes  sir 
powell 
ten hut 
  carry on 
  carry on 
this it 
yes  sir  our new radar 
it s a remarkable
scientific achievement   
   capable of spotting an intruder
on the sea or in the air   
   and at quite a range 
short  now  listen  colonel 
as you know  we re short on patrol planes 
we re gonna have to rely on this   
   thing to detect the enemy 
powell 
general  radar should do the job 
what s it doing here  not set up 
we re about to truck it up
that mountain 
that peak up there is the ideal spot
to put our main radar post 
fielder  at that height  we d be clear
of all interference 
obviously 
but  sir  we can t get permission
to put her up there 
permission 
from the national park service
department of interior 
see  all of this belongs
to the hawaiian national park 
the hawaiian national park 
yes  sir  the wildlife preservation
society is raising hell too 
and we can t get permission 
no  sir 
not unless we want to fight them 
fight them  you re damn right
we re gonna fight them 
  now you make a note of that  fielder 
  yes  sir 
wildlife preservation society 
i feel like a damn fool 
without even consulting me   
   our army has decided
to occupy indo china 
there is no hope for peace now 
i ve said it before
and i ll keep on saying it   
   if we fight the americans  we can t
stop at hawaii or san francisco 
we ll have to march
into washington   
   and dictate peace terms
in the white house 
army hotheads who speak so lightly
of war should think about that 
as i m no longer minister of the navy 
i can do nothing 
i m sorry 
don t blame yourself 
the army leaders are at fault  not you 
i must get back to the fleet 
there is a lot to be done 
it s no use  hal 
i spoke to general miles 
he took it up with general marshall 
the order stands 
the president is off the ultra list 
incredible 
withholding information
from the president 
security found a copy of an intercept
in a wastebasket at the white house 
truth is  the brass don t trust some
men close to the president 
does anyone trust anyone anymore 
  do you even trust your own wife 
  do you 
come to think of it  i believe i do 
part two of no  1390  colonel 
tokyo to embassies
in washington and berlin 
thank you  miss cave 
the japanese are moving south
to occupy french lndo china 
  this is big trouble 
  yeah 
well  ultra list or not   
   someone has to tell
the president about this one 
 therefore  we will impose
a full embargo   
   on all trade with japan 
we do not anticipate immediate
hostile action by japan   
   but you get this information   
   so you may take appropriate
precautionary measures  
 appropriate precautionary measures  
what the hell does that mean 
now  this is signed jointly
by general marshall and admiral stark 
until we know how the japanese will
react  we re not gonna take chances 
  we go on full alert 
  yes  sir 
stark says they don t anticipate
hostile action 
why send a warning at all 
damn it 
damn it  why can t washington
give us the full inside story 
i d sooner form my own opinion 
 don t anticipate hostile action  
well  all right  we ll go ahead 
increase air and sub patrols 
alert senior commanders 
maybe out of this we can find out
how well we can function 
 phone rings 
kaminsky 
earle  this is captain earle 
going on full alert 
yes  captain 
we re going on full alert 
notify all ship  sub and air patrols 
what the hell is going on here 
what are you doing 
carrying out orders 
general short s concern is sabotage 
all aircraft not ready
for flight from now on   
   will be parked in the center   
   so they can be kept under guard 
suppose there s an air raid 
they hit one plane  and it all
goes up in flames 
i m sorry  general s orders 
today s war games   
   of a theoretical attack
on pearl harbor   
   clearly show the need for
six carriers in the attack force 
the general staff   
   wants to limit us to only
three carriers 
we must have six 
if we reduce our striking force   
   from six carriers to only three   
   our mission will fail 
before attacking anything else 
we should attack our general staff 
we believe in aircraft 
but they cling to the ancient theory   
   that decisive naval engagements
must be fought between battleships 
unless we dispel this myth   
   we ll never get their approval 
they are not the only believers
in the  battleship theory  
many officers here today
also support the idea 
i m one of them  we ll soon have
two new unsinkable battlewagons   
   each with a displacement of
64 000 tons and huge guns 
anything that floats can be sunk 
the  unsinkable  ship is a myth 
the war in europe is being
decided by the airplane 
there can be no victory on land or sea 
without control of the air 
i have been chosen to command
this task force 
and i consider this operation risky 
how can we travel 3500 miles
to hawaii without being detected 
this mission will fail unless
we achieve complete surprise 
my ships can t carry fuel
for a trip there and back 
stopping to refuel increases
the possibility of detection 
i am confident that our ships
will reach hawaii safely 
you are too cautious  the case
for using six carriers is sound 
to criticize the plan is defeatist 
no more bickering  as long
as i am commander in chief   
   pearl harbor will be attacked 
i am aware that this is
a dangerous gamble 
but we can t afford the luxury
of playing it safe now 
gentlemen  whether we adopt this
plan or not is no longer an issue 
let us now decide how best
to carry it out 
fuchida s back  fuchida s back 
fuchida  what a surprise 
i m your new air commander 
so treat me well 
you re joking  how did you
rate another promotion 
well  exceptional people get
exceptional treatment 
this ship is crawling with admirals 
something important
must be happening 
we have called you here   
   to explain the purpose of
a new training program 
this  of course  is a matter
of strictest secrecy 
it looks just like pearl harbor 
doesn t it 
and that area down there
looks like ford island  eh 
beautiful 
navy pilots attract geisha girls
but they frighten the fish 
it s not an ideal radar sight 
but at least we got a permit 
let s get the other units working 
easier said than done 
what do you mean 
we have to get all six units adjusted
and link them by phone to headquarters 
that means training men to operate
an information center   
   so they know what to do
with the information 
take it easy  murph 
  you ll figure it out 
  yeah  i ll figure it out 
don t just stand there 
you know how to operate this thing 
we know the theory 
let s put that theory into practice 
  switch on 
  yes  sir 
stay put and keep watching the screen 
in two hours  close down 
i ll send a truck to pick you up 
excuse me  sir 
but what are we watching for 
anything unusual 
any large blip coming from the sea 
colonel  if we do spot something 
what do we do 
report it to headquarters  damn it 
lockard  how  sir 
  what 
we haven t got a telephone  sir 
there s a gas station
a mile down the road 
they must have a phone 
we got 183 combat planes
on this base  general 
the way they re parked now  a one eyed
monkey hanging from a balloon   
   could scatter them to hell
with one hand grenade 
general short gave the order 
 knocking 
come in 
  sir  lieutenants taylor and welch 
  okay  send them in 
you two men get in your planes
and fly over to haleiwa 
yes  sir 
what are our orders when we get there 
just sit tight 
listen for the phone  that s all 
  yes  sir 
  yes  sir 
haleiwa is one
of the subsidiary fields 
we send those two up there 
two more here 
only way i know to disperse
a few of the planes 
if i d get away with it  i d send
all to the neighbor islands 
  you know why we re being transferred 
  them poker games 
  been winning too often 
  yeah 
some sucker loses his shirt 
so he bitches to the general 
that s it 
it s hard to believe
the emperor agreed   
   to fix a date by which the
final decision must be made   
   between war and peace 
his majesty s signature
is a mere formality 
the cabinet is responsible for
all matters of national policy 
the emperor recently read a poem
to his ministers to show how he feels 
 if all people are brethren   
   then why are the winds
and the waves so restless  
 if all people are brethren   
   then why are the winds
and the waves so restless  
this clearly shows how much
the emperor wants to avoid a war 
yes  he has urged us to solve our
differences with washington 
but  sir  the deadline is october 
can a solution be found by then 
perhaps  but if we fail   
   if war does come   
   tell me frankly 
from the navy s viewpoint   
   what are our chances
against the americans 
if we must  we can raise havoc
with them for a year 
after that  i can guarantee nothing 
mr  prime minister  i hope you
will continue the negotiations 
please remember  there is
no last word in diplomacy 
tokyo has ignored
my repeated inquiries   
   and still has made no reply   
   to the compromise proposals
offered by secretary hull 
the war that i have dreaded
for so long   
   may soon become a reality 
nomura has offered
his resignation several times 
but tokyo won t let him quit 
instead they re sending a second
ambassador  kurusu  to help him out 
do you really think
this kurusu can do any good 
well  i doubt it  frank 
he s hardly the most tactful choice 
when he was ambassador in berlin   
   he signed the axis pact
on behalf of japan 
you will sail from hittakopu bay
on november 26 under my strict orders 
the code   climb mt  niitaka 
will be confirmation to go on 
we have tentatively set
the date for the attack   
   on sunday  december 7th 
hawaiian time 
but you must understand that we
are still negotiating in washington 
if a peaceful solution is found   
   the fleet will be recalled at once 
once at sea  to turn back
would be a disgrace 
it would destroy the morale of the men 
they re in a high state of readiness 
physically and psychologically 
enough  if any commander is inclined
to reject an order to return   
   when the path for peace is open   
   let him resign now 
finally  gentlemen   
   many misinformed japanese   
   believe that america is a
nation divided  isolationist   
   and that americans are
only interested   
   in enjoying a life of luxury   
   and are spiritually
and morally corrupt 
but that is a great mistake 
if war becomes inevitable   
   america would be the most formidable
foe that we have ever fought 
i ve lived in washington
and studied at harvard   
   so i know the americans are
a proud and just people 
  you sick or something 
  no 
i ve been piecing together this
batch of new intercepts 
  a frightening picture is taking shape 
  oh 
ambassadors nomura and kurusu
asked their government   
   to extend a deadline for suspending
negotiation between japan and america 
  you remember that 
  yeah 
now  according to this latest
intercept   
   tokyo wants to conclude
negotiations with us   
   no later than november 29   
   after which  and i quote 
 things are automatically
going to happen  
now   
   look at this intelligence report
from the british 
five japanese troop transports
with naval escort   
   were sighted off formosa 
heading south 
we ve been monitoring their fleet 
most of it seems to be on home waters 
i m not so sure 
i d make a bet they re going to attack us 
japan is going to attack us 
the 29th is only four days off 
the 30th is on a sunday 
we re gonna be attacked on sunday 
the 30th of november 
the pieces fit together 
but can you prove it 
no  but i m convinced i m right 
miss cave  get me general marshall 
oh  general marshall s
at fort benning  sir 
then get me the secretary of war 
i ve got the evidence  al 
and i m gonna make the brass
around here admit i m right 
bratton s analysis makes sense 
his facts are undeniable 
henry  i m washing my hands
of the whole matter 
from now on  it s in your hands   
   and in those
of the navy department 
i ll call the president 
a message declaring a full alert
will be sent out 
sir 
general marshall anticipated
an emergency like this 
before he left to attend maneuvers   
   he made out this alert order 
as you know  after the cabinet
decided to send japan to war   
   they held an imperial conference
at the palace 
his majesty  who participated
in this conference   
   which is a mere formality   
   was depressed and silent
all through the meeting 
today his majesty will ask
the customary questions about the war   
   and you will make
the traditional replies 
there can be no more tragic ritual
than this conversation   
   between his majesty
who does not want war   
   and your excellency 
who has opposed it so vigorously 
as minister of the imperial household   
   i am not allowed to attend this ritual 
fortunately for me   
   i won t have to witness
this tragic ceremony 
i can go no farther 
the military attaché will
take you from here 
 man speaks in japanese 
 speaks in japanese 
sir  a message 
 from admiral yamamoto 
commander in chief  combined fleet   
   to admiral nagumo  third fleet   
   climb mount niitaka  
hostilities will begin
on december 7th   
   exactly as scheduled 
read this back to me 
 japanese future action unpredictable 
but hostile action possible
at any moment 
if hostilities cannot be avoided   
   the united states desires that
japan commit the first overt act  
wait a minute  read that again 
 if hostilities cannot be avoided 
the united states desires   
   that japan commit
the first overt act 
this shouldn t be construed
as restricting you   
   to a course of action
jeopardizing your defense 
prior to hostile japanese action   
   you are directed to undertake
reconnaissance   
   and other measures
as you deem necessary 
these measures should be
carried out   
   so as not to alarm
the civil population   
   or disclose intent  by order
of general george c  marshall  
 not to alarm the civil population  
what do you make of it 
well   
   if you ask me  sir 
it s double talk 
but the chief of staff doesn t go in
for double talk 
  we re going on alert 
  again 
but the men are confused 
so many alerts 
  damn it  unconfuse them 
  yes  sir 
 japanese forces may attack
the philippines   
   thailand  the kra peninsula
and borneo 
this dispatch is to be considered
a war warning  
well  there it is  gentlemen 
you now have
as much information as i do 
that s the second warning
in three days 
 japanese forces may attack
the philippines   
   thailand  the kra peninsula
and borneo  
they don t mention us 
that s correct  i think it should be
considered significant 
well  gentlemen   
   we have a job to do 
washington wants us to send
a squadron of fighters to midway 
and another squadron to wake 
when can you sail 
well  the enterprise can sail
tomorrow morning 
i ll need a day or two  we re just
completing repairs on the lexington 
hurry things along  john 
i want you out there to probe 
i want planes up in the air
morning and afternoon 
i want a report on any sign
of hostile ships 
understood 
do you want battleships along 
hell  no  they re too slow 
if we re gonna probe  let s probe 
we don t want anything holding us up 
you re right  but i m not ready
to commit them myself 
not until i know when and where 
do you plan to keep half the fleet
at sea while the carriers are gone 
no  it s too risky 
i ll have to keep the fleet
here at pearl while you re away 
get out  get back as soon as you can 
i don t like the idea of having my
battleships without air cover 
  let s get going 
group  yes  sir 
admiral 
kim 
level with me 
i want a clear directive 
if i run into a jap ship 
what action do i take 
use your common sense 
that s the best damn order i ever had 
if i see so much as a sampan there   
   i ll blow it out of the water 
 intelligence report 
u s  ships now at pearl harbor   
   six battleships  three light cruisers   
    16 destroyers and one
aircraft carrier  
no information about
the other american carriers 
you know today s date 
december 1st 
yes  but tonight will be november 30th 
when we cross
the international date line   
   we ll push the clock ahead five hours   
   and turn the calendar back a full day 
making today yesterday 
don t be silly 
today can t change into yesterday 
you re not too intelligent
but i ll try to explain   
   so listen carefully 
it s a little before 1300 hours  right 
so why are we making supper
at this hour 
1300  it should be lunchtime 
right  and the date line makes up
for that time difference   
   by turning today into yesterday 
i don t quite understand  but if we
see the enemy across that line   
   i guess it would be useless
to shoot at them 
because how can today s shells
hit yesterday s enemy

of them until recently

yes  on the weekend 
 only specially screened members
of your communications staff   
   are to be permitted to process
the 14 part message   
   and prepare the typed translation  
it will be difficult without
the help of a skilled typist 
the situation right now
is extremely delicate 
we must be prepared   
   to have each part of the message
decoded as soon as it comes in 
i ll alert the code room 
we ll reach point d soon  sir 
from point d proceed to point e

audience with the emperor 
why is this so important 
does this roosevelt message
say anything new 
it merely proposes
a heart to heart exchange   
   between the two chiefs of state 
it could start negotiations afresh 
it s too late for that 
it s just as well the message
didn t come a day or two earlier 
what do i tell ambassador grew

hey  look out 
in all my 50 years

   i have never seen a document
so crowded with infamous falsehoods   
   and distortions   
   on a scale so huge   
   that i never imagined until today   
   that any government
on this planet   
   was capable of uttering them 
mr  hull 
go 
what s the matter  why in hell
doesn t the next wave take off 
but  sir  no one has given the order 
we ve knocked out
the american airfields   
   sunk four battleships 
heavily damaged three more 
sir  rear admiral yamaguchi s
carrier has signaled 
 attack group ready for takeoff  
unfortunately  the american
carriers were not at pearl harbor 
since we don t know where they are   
   we can t use our limited
supply of fuel to look for them 
we must not forget that enemy
submarines will be searching for us 
we have been lucky so far 
no take off signal yet 
there is a signal now 
it says   all ships head for japan
as soon as our planes return  
it can t be 
it must be a mistake 
we cannot turn back now 
we must destroy the american
carriers and their dry docks   
   no matter how long it takes 
you re wrong  our mission has
been completely accomplished 
this task force is vital to us 
it is my duty to return it intact 
this war is just beginning 
we have a long way to go 
yes  all right 
this came from the decoding room 
a cablegram from the war department 
get a copy to admiral kimmel 
 sirens sounding 
 chattering 
pardon me  admiral 
  from washington 
  thank you 
gentlemen 
 the japanese are presenting
at 1 p m   
   eastern standard time today   
   what amounts to an ultimatum 
just what significance the hour set
may have  we do not know   
   but be on alert accordingly  
signed   
   george c  marshall 
chief of staff 
my god 
this leaves the navy with only two
combat groups in the central pacific 
ours and the lexington 
we don t want to get caught
like they did 
i don t intend to 
when can you be ready for sea again 
we can fuel and provision
and be under way before dawn 
good  that s good 
 music plays 
here is an announcement from the
navy department released december 7th 
 before daybreah today 
the imperial navy successfully launched   
   a large scale air raid against
the american pacific fleet in hawaii  
we salute the commander in chief
of our fleet   
   admiral yamamoto 
i had intended to deal a fatal blow
to the american fleet   
   by attacking pearl harbor   
   immediately after japan s
official declaration of war 
but according to the american radio 
pearl harbor was attacked   
   55 minutes before our ultimatum   
   was delivered in washington 
i can t imagine anything   
   that would infuriate
the americans more 
i fear all we have done   
   is to awaken a sleeping giant
and fill him with a terrible resolve
