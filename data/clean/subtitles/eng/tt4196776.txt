iron hand  it s even worse than before 
what s that got to do with me 
because it matters  it matters 
not to me  it doesn t 
all that matters is staying alive

i don t believe that and neither do you 
look at yourself 
look at what you re doing 
you can t live like this for much longer 
jason  i came here because i found something 
i found your father s name in the treadstone files 
he was an analyst 
he wasn t in operations  he wasn t near any of that stuff 
i m telling you what i saw 
it looked like he was involved directly 
and there s more 
more about you 
what do you mean 
before you joined the program  they were watching you 
watching me 
you ve tortured yourself for a long time now  jason 
you torture yourself for what you ve done 
but you don t know the truth about what they did to you 
you need to read those files 
move  they tracked you 
alpha one has eyes on two targets  one female  one male 
identify the male 
copy that  sir 
alpha one  we need an id on the male target

the greek government is declaring a state of emergency 
bravo team  we are retargeting parsons 
we got her 
split the team  put her in a box 
a suspect matching bourne s description
has stolen a police motorcycle 
he s coming for parsons 
where the hell is the asset 
two minutes out  sir 
parsons is at the statue of athena 
copy that 
bravo team is down 
sir  the asset is arriving on scene 
  pull up the dash cam 
  copy 
give me the feed and direct comms to the asset 
engaging targets 
i m accessing athens police tactical data 
i need eyes overhead 
bring up the satellite suite 
sir  i m showing a misty and a kh 12 satellite available 
  light up the 12 
  yes  sir 
satellite video feed is online 
police have blocked the road to the north 
the target will be forced to turn left 
another barricade in 200 meters 
target turning left again 
bourne s heading for the alley 
left at the top of the hill 
stairway 
up the hill  heading east 
give me a strike point 
he s found a way out 
two hundred meters to your left 
19 solomou  get to the roof 
target should pass within your line of sight 
19 solomou  copy 
focus the satellites on these coordinates 
and give me a lock on the motorcycle when it gets there 
copy that 
i ve got the targets  they re approaching omonia from fidiou 
look west 
the long boulevard 
coming at you in 55 seconds 
copy that 
the asset is online 
target s with you in 15 seconds 
five seconds 
contact 
stay low 
find a shot 
hold on 
targets are down 
where s bourne 
ma am  a police helicopter
spotted three bodies on the roof near the asset 
a tactical team s on its way 
nicky 
don t move 
athens police have entered the building 
asset  you need to get out of there 
negative 
we don t even know if bourne s alive 
you want to lose this guy 
this is director dewey 
you have 20 seconds 
hold on  nicky 
i m going to get you to cover 
no 
no 
no  don t 
i m coming 
  get a location on christian dassault 
  yes  sir 
if he was working with nicky parsons 
he will lead us to jason bourne 
and let me know if you get a hit on that malware 
sir  can i clarify one thing 
yeah 
does the asset know bourne 
why would you ask me that 
his behavior on the rooftop 
it suggested a connection 
the last time bourne came back 
he exposed the blackbriar program 
it compromised active operations 
the asset was in syria undercover 
he was captured  tortured 
and it took two damn years to get him out 
so you think that s why bourne wants the files 
to go public again 
i have no idea why he came back 
but whatever he s doing  he wants to destroy us 
we can t let that happen 
so  you give me a call soon as you hear anything 
yes  sir 
and now  the founder and chairman of deep dream 
aaron kalloor 
you all know why we re here 
we re gonna be unveiling a new platform 
we think it is a bold new step
to allow us to serve our community better 
we re a community right now
that is transcending national boundaries 
and i think we re 1 5 billion users 
in a nutshell  as you know  we have an ecosystem
of hundreds of thousands of apps at this point 
and what this new platform will do
will be to integrate users  data and preferences 
and use that information
to enrich and tailor make each unique user experience
in a way that is  frankly  unprecedented 
um  now  i can see some journalists  pens twitching 
  ready to ask about privacy 
  yeah 
this is a concern to many people  and so it should be 
i mean  this is something that matters to us 
and let me just say  uh 
i understand nobody wants to feel like they re being watched 
so let me just tell you 
when you come to deep dream  when you use our service 
no one will be watching you 
  mr  kalloor 
  right this way  sir 
enjoy your meal 
thank you 
congratulations 
i hear your stockholders were very happy with that new platform 
and i heard you got hacked 
we re dealing with it 
this changes everything  there s too much risk 
i m out 
aaron 
you are an extraordinarily gifted and perceptive young man 
when you agreed to help us 
it was because you understood the very grave threats that   
do you have any idea of the shit storm i ll have on my hands
if this arrangement becomes public 
i already took a hit with snowden 
and you want more 
our enemies have become much more sophisticated 
gathering metadata is no longer adequate 
we need a back door into your new platform 
and a way past the encryptions 
and when that s not enough  you ll want something new 
you don t get it  do you 
privacy is freedom 
maybe that s something you should think about defending 
you little prick 
you didn t believe in privacy or freedom
when we funded your startup 
turned you into a billionaire 
i paid you back many  many  many times over 
and i was never comfortable with any of this 
i m out 
i m done selling out our customers 
but you would sell out your country 
the truth is  we wouldn t be having this conversation
if you didn t feel personally at risk 
you talk about a free internet 
you tell yourself you re saving the world 
but all you re doing is making it a much more dangerous place 
and you re sure as hell making
this country much more difficult to defend 
and you re sure as hell accountable for that  aaron 
accountable 
bourne 
everything on the table 
open it 
sure 
bourne has surfaced  in berlin 
get the berlin team up 
where is she 
she s dead 
she knew the risks 
i warned her 
she made a choice 
you exploited her 
berlin team is mobile 
what do we have on the location 
it s an address linked to christian dassault 
anything on bourne 
nothing yet  i m accessing cctv now 
sir  i ve been thinking  maybe we ve got this wrong 
what if he s not coming for us 
what if it s something else 
you don t have any idea who you re dealing with 
we should work together  bourne 
you exposed the blackbriar program 
we re both after the same thing  right 
we both want to take down
the corrupt institutions that control society 
i m not on your side 
cctv feed is online 
he s on a computer 
we have to stop this 
if he puts those files online  operations will be compromised
and people will die 
yes  sir 
at least when you re done  leave me the files 
these programs have to be exposed 
people have a right to know 
we need that computer 
there s a phone in the room 
i can use it to delete the files 
  got the phone 
  where s that team 
five minutes out  sir 
we re running out of time  get there 
listen to me  david 
i ve done something 
something   
   that came at a cost 
one day you ll understand why 
i gotta get back to washington 
i love you  son 
they re fighting  sir 
one more firewall 
files deleted  sir 
call in 
bourne  my name is heather lee 
i m not in charge here 
i wasn t here when you went missing 
i can see you re going through the old treadstone files 
retracing your history 
i know you re looking for something 
let me help you find it 
give me that phone 
yes  sir 
jason  this is robert dewey  do you remember me 
jason  your dad was a patriot 
he could see the threats that america was facing 
and  like you  he chose to serve his country
out of a profound sense of duty 
he would not want to see you harm the agency 
you have to stop this 
and you have to stop it now 
sir  our eta is   
he s on the move  be ready 
take point 
on me 
the elevator 
we lost him  sir 
malcolm smith  contract only  based out of london 
ran all of treadstone s surveillance in the late  90s 
when bourne was recruited 
is he still active 
he s private security now 
contact the asset and tell him
i want him on the ground in london in six hours 
i think that could be a mistake  sir 
a mistake  why 
there is an argument for catching bourne instead of killing him 
all right  let s hear it 
bourne s been off the grid for a long time 
he s been hiding in the shadows  he s seen things 
he knows things that could help us 
bringing him back in is the smart move 
and how are we going to do that 
albert hirsch wrote the psychal evaluation when bourne left the program 
he concluded bourne is still a patriot at heart 
and that leaving the program could come back to haunt him 
and what are you suggesting 
i watched bourne with those files 
desperately looking into his past 
and i think he s at a tipping point 
if i could get face to face with him 
i think i can bring him back in 
one attempt 
and if it fails 
you do what you have to 
well  it makes sense to me  what do you think  bob 
let s give it a shot 
all right  do it 
bring bourne in  or tie it off 
but this ends now 
thank you  sir 
sir  i m sorry   
no  don t worry about that 
better get some sleep  kid 
you got a long 24 hours ahead of you 
yes  sir 
it s taking too long 
it shouldn t still be buggy this close to launch 
well  i don t think it s buggy 
i think we ve changed some things
that s going to change the parameters 
we re going to have to go and   
okay  we need to change them back 
amanda  can we get that note over to kyle 
  absolutely 
  look  i think you re right 
  i just don t think we want to   
  i m tired of waiting 
mr  kalloor 
what the hell is this 
mr  kalloor  my name is john burroughs 
i m from the department of justice 
i m hereby serving you with the enclosed complaint   
really  we have to do this in public 
issued by the us government
against deep dream corporation for violation of the sherman act 
this complaint requires you to
preserve all personal and corporate financial records
pending antitrust motions to be filed in federal court 
good day 
  this is dewey 
  aaron  it s a message 
and maybe we should think about
what we re doing before it gets any worse 
so  you think if we give him what he wants  it ll end there 
you know  i m just saying that maybe we should listen 
i want you to pull up all the
records of all the meetings i ve ever had with dewey 
all the records  even the off the books discussions 
especially those 
we re going to vegas  i need an insurance policy 
are you in london 
yes 
why are you sending her 
she serves a purpose 
i work alone 
not this time 
don t make this personal 
bourne betrayed us  it s always been personal 
you know who you re dealing with 
you better make sure you re ready 
there s something you should know about deep dream 
but i need an assurance
that i have your support 
you got it  what do you have 
kalloor is planning something for vegas 
yes 
this is jason bourne 
i need to talk

i am taking operational control

why 
jesus christ  bourne  i m falling 
bourne  please 
i can hear them 
beirut 
i went there to tell him that treadstone had approached me 
but if it was his program  why didn t he say anything to me 
i ve done something 
something   
   that came at a cost 
that was the day he was killed 
they said he was killed by terrorists 
he wasn t killed by terrorists  was he 
think about your family s safety 
smith  you keep your mouth shut 
the next bullet s in your head 
why was he killed 
why 
he was killed because of you 
your father  he wasn t in operations 
he didn t know we d chosen you  when he found out  he   
he threatened to expose the program 
he didn t want you turned into a killer 
who killed him 
who killed him 
don t do it 
where is he 
he s almost there 
we re gonna stop this now

i ll work my way down the canal 
no  you re done in london 
what are you talking about 
there s another play to be made 
now that he knows what we did  he ll come for both of us

thanks a lot to brad and all the folks at exocon
for having us back  and to you guys for turning out 
before the director comes out to join us 
i just wanted to share a few words with you guys 
a long time ago  i had this idea 
  copy that 
  a beautiful idea  to create a place  online   
facial recognition got a hit 
bourne was on a ba flight from heathrow to vegas 
it landed two hours ago 
how the hell did he get through immigration 
someone issued him an agency security clearance on his passport

made me a lot more rich than is probably healthy 
when i come on stage  take care of kalloor and the girl

all this success has come at a cost 
there is a cancer at the heart of deep dream 
a guilty secret  and  um

you took a long time to get here  jason 
i know about beirut 
i know what you did

you didn t come here for revenge 
you came here because you know it s time to come in 
your father created the program 
didn t have what it takes to make it work 
and you did 
you always did 
that s why you volunteered 
i volunteered because i thought our enemies killed him 
i volunteered because of a lie 
no  you volunteered because of who you are 
you volunteered because you are jason bourne 
and not david webb 
thirty two kills  jason 
every one of them made a difference 
people all across this country are safer because of what you did 
i m trying to find another way 
and how s that working out for you 
you re never going to find any peace 
not until you admit to yourself who you really are

it s in your blood 
mr  kalloor 
aaron  what were you going to tell everyone at the convention 
what are you hiding  aaron 
why did somebody try to assassinate you 
what s the cancer at the heart of deep dream 
i think it would be
inappropriate to pass any comment at this stage 
but i look forward to working with the authorities
to find out who was responsible 
and to getting back to deep dream 
where we can continue our important work  thank you 
have you been lying to your users 
sir 
i wanted to say i m sorry  sir 
about vegas 
director dewey s tactics were unwise 
unwise 
we re still trying to come
up with a narrative to explain what happened 
that son of a bitch put a spotlight on iron hand 
on all of us 
kalloor hasn t gone public yet 
i know aaron 
there are still moves we can make with him 
tell me 
dewey s problem was that he belonged in the past 
people like kalloor are shaping the future 
these are my people 
i know how to deal with him 
and what do you want 
when you appoint a new agency director 
you re going to need someone working for your interests 
someone
empowered by you 
what about bourne 
you still think you can bring him in 
i have his trust 
after what we went through 
i ll bring him in 
i m certain of it 
and if you can t 
then he ll have to be put down 
it s an interesting proposal 
you can pull over here 
of course  if you decide that
you don t need me  then that s not a problem 
there are many other agencies who would want what i know 
i brought you something 
it s a cast from your father s star 
on the memorial wall at langley 
i m sorry for what happened to you 
how you were treated 
but the people that did that are gone 
and things are changing at the agency 
what is it you want 
i know you ve always been a patriot 
that what happens to this country matters to you 
we need you to help protect us 
come back in 
and we ll work together 
let me think about it 
how will i find you 
you still think you can bring him in 
i have his trust
