i dont believe that and neither do you
look at yourself
look at what youre doing
you cant live like this for much longer
jason i came here because i found something
i found your fathers name in the treadstone files
he was an analyst
he wasnt in operations he wasnt near any of that stuff
im telling you what i saw
it looked like he was involved directly
and theres more
more about you
what do you mean
before you joined the program they were watching you
watching me
youve tortured yourself for a long time now jason
you torture yourself for what youve done
but you dont know the truth about what they did to you
you need to read those files
move they tracked you
alpha one has eyes on two targets one female one male
identify the male
copy that sir
alpha one we need an id on the male target
weve got to get out of here

bravo team we are retargeting parsons

two minutes out sir

copy that
bravo team is down
sir the asset is arriving on scene
pull up the dash cam

give me the feed and direct comms to the asset
engaging targets
im accessing athens police tactical data
i need eyes overhead
bring up the satellite suite

target turning left again
bournes heading for the alley

stairway
up the hill heading east
give me a strike point
hes found a way out
two hundred meters to your left
19 solomou get to the roof

nicky
dont move
athens police have entered the building
asset you need to get out of there
negative
we dont even know if bournes alive
you want to lose this guy
this is director dewey
you have 20 seconds
hold on nicky
im going to get you to cover
no
no
no dont
im coming
get a location on christian dassault
yes sir
if he was working with nicky parsons
he will lead us to jason bourne
and let me know if you get a hit on that malware
sir can i clarify one thing
yeah
does the asset know bourne
why would you ask me that
his behavior on the rooftop
it suggested a connection
the last time bourne came back
he exposed the blackbriar program
it compromised active operations
the asset was in syria undercover
he was captured tortured
and it took two damn years to get him out
so you think thats why bourne wants the files
to go public again
i have no idea why he came back
but whatever hes doing he wants to destroy us
we cant let that happen
so you give me a call soon as you hear anything
yes sir
and now the founder and chairman of deep dream
aaron kalloor
you all know why were here
were gonna be unveiling a new platform
we think it is a bold new step
to allow us to serve our community better
were a community right now
that is transcending national boundaries
and i think were 15 billion users
in a nutshell as you know we have an ecosystem
of hundreds of thousands of apps at this point
and what this new platform will do
will be to integrate users data and preferences
and use that information
to enrich and tailormake each unique user experience
in a way that is frankly unprecedented
um now i can see some journalists pens twitching
ready to ask about privacy
yeah
this is a concern to many people and so it should be
i mean this is something that matters to us
and let me just say uh
i understand nobody wants to feel like theyre being watched
so let me just tell you
when you come to deep dream when you use our service
no one will be watching you
mr kalloor
right this way sir
enjoy your meal
thank you
congratulations
i hear your stockholders were very happy with that new platform
and i heard you got hacked
were dealing with it
this changes everything theres too much risk
im out
aaron
you are an extraordinarily gifted and perceptive young man
when you agreed to help us
it was because you understood the very grave threats that
do you have any idea of the shitstorm ill have on my hands
if this arrangement becomes public
i already took a hit with snowden
and you want more
our enemies have become much more sophisticated
gathering metadata is no longer adequate
we need a back door into your new platform
and a way past the encryptions
and when thats not enough youll want something new
you dont get it do you
privacy is freedom
maybe thats something you should think about defending
you little prick
you didnt believe in privacy or freedom
when we funded your startup
turned you into a billionaire
i paid you back many many many times over
and i was never comfortable with any of this
im out
im done selling out our customers
but you would sell out your country
the truth is we wouldnt be having this conversation
if you didnt feel personally at risk
you talk about a free internet
you tell yourself youre saving the world
but all youre doing is making it a much more dangerous place
and youre sure as hell making
this country much more difficult to defend
and youre sure as hell accountable for that aaron
accountable
bourne
everything on the table
open it
sure
bourne has surfaced in berlin
get the berlin team up
where is she
shes dead
she knew the risks
i warned her
she made a choice
you exploited her
berlin team is mobile
what do we have on the location
its an address linked to christian dassault
anything on bourne
nothing yet im accessing cctv now
sir ive been thinking maybe weve got this wrong
what if hes not coming for us
what if its something else
you dont have any idea who youre dealing with
we should work together bourne
you exposed the blackbriar program
were both after the same thing right
we both want to take down
the corrupt institutions that control society
im not on your side
cctv feed is online
hes on a computer
we have to stop this
if he puts those files online operations will be compromised
and people will die
yes sir
at least when youre done leave me the files
these programs have to be exposed
people have a right to know
we need that computer
theres a phone in the room
i can use it to delete the files
got the phone
wheres that team
five minutes out sir
were running out of time get there
listen to me david
ive done something
something
that came at a cost
one day youll understand why
i gotta get back to washington
i love you son
theyre fighting sir
one more firewall
files deleted sir
call in
bourne my name is heather lee
im not in charge here
i wasnt here when you went missing
i can see youre going through the old treadstone files
retracing your history
i know youre looking for something
let me help you find it
give me that phone
yes sir
jason this is robert dewey do you remember me
jason your dad was a patriot
he could see the threats that america was facing
and like you he chose to serve his country
out of a profound sense of duty
he would not want to see you harm the agency
you have to stop this
and you have to stop it now
sir our eta is
hes on the move be ready
take point
on me
the elevator
we lost him sir
malcolm smith contract only based out of london
ran all of treadstones surveillance in the late 90s
when bourne was recruited
is he still active
hes private security now
contact the asset and tell him
i want him on the ground in london in six hours
i think that could be a mistake sir
a mistake why
there is an argument for catching bourne instead of killing him
all right lets hear it
bournes been off the grid for a long time
hes been hiding in the shadows hes seen things
he knows things that could help us
bringing him back in is the smart move
and how are we going to do that
albert hirsch wrote the psychal evaluation when bourne left the program
he concluded bourne is still a patriot at heart
and that leaving the program could come back to haunt him
and what are you suggesting
i watched bourne with those files
desperately looking into his past
and i think hes at a tipping point
if i could get facetoface with him
i think i can bring him back in
one attempt
and if it fails
you do what you have to
well it makes sense to me what do you think bob
lets give it a shot
all right do it
bring bourne in or tie it off
but this ends now
thank you sir
sir im sorry
no dont worry about that
better get some sleep kid
you got a long 24 hours ahead of you
yes sir
its taking too long
it shouldnt still be buggy this close to launch
well i dont think its buggy
i think weve changed some things
thats going to change the parameters
were going to have to go and
okay we need to change them back
amanda can we get that note over to kyle
absolutely
look i think youre right
i just dont think we want to
im tired of waiting
mr kalloor
what the hell is this
mr kalloor my name is john burroughs
im from the department of justice
im hereby serving you with the enclosed complaint
really we have to do this in public
issued by the us government
against deep dream corporation for violation of the sherman act
this complaint requires you to
preserve all personal and corporate financial records
pending antitrust motions to be filed in federal court
good day
this is dewey
aaron its a message
and maybe we should think about
what were doing before it gets any worse
so you think if we give him what he wants itll end there
you know im just saying that maybe we should listen
i want you to pull up all the
records of all the meetings ive ever had with dewey
all the records even the offthebooks discussions
especially those
were going to vegas i need an insurance policy

the ceo of socialmedia giant deep dream aaron kalloor is here
tonight policing a free internet
personal rights versus public safety

oh sure man by all means ladies and gentlemen aaron kalloor
thank you thanks a lot
thanks a lot to brad and all the folks at exocon
for having us back and to you guys for turning out
before the director comes out to join us
i just wanted to share a few words with you guys
a long time ago i had this idea
copy that
a beautiful idea to create a place online
facial recognition got a hit
bourne was on a ba flight from heathrow to vegas
it landed two hours ago
how the hell did he get through immigration
someone issued him an agency security clearance on his passport
well it turned out to be a pretty popular idea
people from around the world started using our service
well first off this has all
made me a lot more rich than is probably healthy
when i come on stage take care of kalloor and the girl
copy
but what i mean to say is that you know
all this success has come at a cost
there is a cancer at the heart of deep dream
a guilty secret and um
i have to share it with all of you guys
son of a bitch is about to take us down
take out kalloor and the girl right now
stay there
okay
when i was starting out i uh
i took money to start my company
made a bargain with a guy in a dark suit
and now hes come back to take my soul

bournes on his way up to you
you took a long time to get here jason
i know about beirut
i know what you did
it all ends tonight
be a lot easier to do it right away
you didnt come here for revenge
you came here because you know its time to come in
your father created the program
didnt have what it takes to make it work
and you did
you always did
thats why you volunteered
i volunteered because i thought our enemies killed him
i volunteered because of a lie
no you volunteered because of who you are
you volunteered because you are jason bourne
and not david webb
thirtytwo kills jason
every one of them made a difference
people all across this country are safer because of what you did
im trying to find another way
and hows that working out for you
youre never going to find any peace
not until you admit to yourself who you really are
its time to come in jason
its time to come in
i cant
not for you
you were never here
you dont have to go after him
this can stop now
you have a choice
lets go
have your ids ready
have your ids ready ladies and gentlemen

next two units involved identify
this is air 1 be advised suspect vehicles
have crashed into the southeast entrance of the riviera
we have an armed suspect
heading into the storm drain south of the riviera
youre a traitor youve always been a traitor
its in your blood
mr kalloor
aaron what were you going to tell everyone at the convention
what are you hiding aaron
why did somebody try to assassinate you
whats the cancer at the heart of deep dream
i think it would be
inappropriate to pass any comment at this stage
but i look forward to working with the authorities
to find out who was responsible
and to getting back to deep dream
where we can continue our important work thank you
have you been lying to your users
sir
i wanted to say im sorry sir
about vegas
director deweys tactics were unwise
unwise
were still trying to come
up with a narrative to explain what happened
that son of a bitch put a spotlight on iron hand
on all of us
kalloor hasnt gone public yet
i know aaron
there are still moves we can make with him
tell me
deweys problem was that he belonged in the past
people like kalloor are shaping the future
these are my people
i know how to deal with him
and what do you want
when you appoint a new agency director
youre going to need someone working for your interests
someone
empowered by you
what about bourne
you still think you can bring him in
i have his trust
after what we went through
ill bring him in
im certain of it
and if you cant
then hell have to be put down
its an interesting proposal
you can pull over here
of course if you decide that
you dont need me then thats not a problem
there are many other agencies who would want what i know
i brought you something
its a cast from your fathers star
on the memorial wall at langley
im sorry for what happened to you
how you were treated
but the people that did that are gone
and things are changing at the agency
what is it you want
i know youve always been a patriot
that what happens to this country matters to you
we need you to help protect us
come back in
and well work together
let me think about it
how will i find you
you still think you can bring him in
i have his trust
