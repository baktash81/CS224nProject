an unnecessarily complicated bomb
is being attached
to the inside of the main energy core 
if the mayor isn t here in five minutes
to negotiate the city s surrender 
then i shall destroy gotham city 
i did something 
doctor  that sounds frightening
and overly complicated 
talk us through it 
well  i don t wanna scare
any small children who may be listening 
but it s a little known fact
that gotham city
is built on a bunch of flimsy plates
stuck together 
there s literally nothing beneath us 
except an infinite abyss
that smells like dirty underwear 
if joker s bomb were to go off 
these plates would break apart 
plunging every gotham citizen
into the eternal abyss forever 
and you wouldn t want that  now would you 
now get me the mayor  joker out 
madam mayor  i cannot ask you to do this 
  jim  did you find batman

batman s been on the job
for a very  very  very 
very  very  very  very  very long time 
he has aged phenomenally 
however  despite all the great work
batman has done for us 
gotham city is still the most
crime ridden city in the world 
  she s got a great point 
  interesting 
historically speaking  that is accurate 
  he hasn t captured riddler 
  you know  she s right 
he hasn t captured bane 
  huh 
  or catwoman 
or two face 
or any of gotham s other villains 
he s not good at his job 
including the joker 
she s making a lot of sense 
excuse me  i m so sorry  excuse me

karate chopping poor people
in a halloween costume 
we need to take
what s good about batman   
   and marry it to actual laws
and proper ethics
and accountability 
i hate everything you just said 
because my dream is for the police force
to team up with batman 
waiter 
wouldn t that be better 
and i know that  together 
the world s greatest detective   
   and gotham s finest
could clean up these crime ridden streets 
forever

he s not loose 
he has to go someplace outside the law 
  outside the law 
  yeah 
somewhere like  uh

from phantom s own laundry 
here to take that bad stuff
off your hands 
wait  that s it  the phantom zone

how do i put the joker
in the phantom zone 
joker can only be put in the phantom zone
using the phantom zone projector 
current location 
superman s fortress of solitude
inside the atomic cauldron 
however  only a person that isn t
shredded  ripped  or extremely swoll
can enter the cauldron 
ugh  i m way too buff 
you also have beautiful abs  sir 
that s my cross to bear 
additionally  once inside the cauldron 
multiple kryptonian
defense systems engage 
including the acid moat  ring of napalm 
and the jaws of death 
chance of total mission failure is 110  
those are not great odds 
wait a minute 
  hey  kid 
  yes  sir 
  you re super nimble  right 
  i sure am 
  and small 
  very 
  and quiet 
  when i desire to be 
and 110  expendable 
i don t know what that means  but okay 
great  follow me 
we are gonna steal
the phantom zone projector from superman 
  steal 
  yeah 
we have to right a wrong 
and  sometimes  in order to right a wrong 
you have to do a wrong right 
gandhi said that 
are we sure gandhi said that 
  i m paraphrasing 
  cool 
preparing fortress
of solitude infiltration gear 
wow  look at all these 
do i get a costume for the mission  too 
i got a feeling that you ll just look
like a kid on halloween 
don t you think

dress up parties are for grown ups only 
wait  what s that one there 
that one was for the assignment
called the jamaican caper 
the locals called me reggae man 
i love it 
ah  feels like i was poured into this 
my only trouble is 
these pants are just a little tight 
i don t know if i could throw a kick
or jump in them 
i got an idea  rip  that s better 
now i m free  now i m moving 
come on  batman  let s get grooving 
i can only look you in the eyes right now

i m just gonna put my arm right here 
and we re just gonna
gently ease out of here 
and here we go 
okay  like all superheroes 
superman has zero friends 
and he spends most of his time
basking in sweet  sweet isolation 
here at his alone palace 
so  i ll keep him busy
while you sneak into that vent
and get the projector  got it 
copy that  oh  here s an idea 
i could also   
whoa  whoa
