best friend and mentor
built to house
fearsome super powered criminals
strykers island
is the worlds most
inescapable prison
which is where
you dorks come in

um actually i think
wed just rather stay here
yeah i mean
we get summers off
allyoucandrink water

every miercoles
oh you have nothing
until youve licked
from the cold steel
straw of power
not so fast
lois lane told us
all about you hamster
hamster a hamster is a
is a hacky sack
a hamster is a mouse
that had too much for lunch
we are guinea pigs
and when were through
with you buster youll know it
hmm
whats going on
that was your cue to attack
uh oh sorry i i was
waiting for him to go first
yeah but if i went first
your fire would melt my ice
so maybe the the wing lady
should go first
i have a name
but then id set
her wings on fire
and i dont think
any of us want that
well you dont want
ice on wings
why
they it clogs the feathers
just get him
whoo that was fun
now then lets go free lex
huh
this ends now sister
i have you in my lasso of truth
oh you want the truth
the boots are a bit much
is this really the best way
to find superman
because to me
this just seems gross
what do you mean gross
smelling stuff is one of the
greatest joys of being a dog
next to licking
any part of your body
i mean i lick myself
all the time
well that explains the breath
you wanna find lulu and
rescue captain hair gel right
well i suggest
you start sniffing
you know what they say
smell is the sight of the nose
no one says that
well they should check it
uhhuh
a poodle drooled right here
someone threw a perfectly good
pizza crust in that dumpster right there
and on that corner
that corner
right there oh no dang
a pigeon got her heart broken
i can still smell the hurt
she was a heavy crier
its a superpower
that every dog possesses
even a wack one like you
im not wack
oh
ooh is that a bandaid
its walkoclock
whatohwhat
nothing
okay
because it sounded like
a super adorable nickname
you got for your walks
with your owner
all right maybe this is when
me and supes used to hang out
every morning
since i was a puppy
aw well you might
not have your superman
but at least you have us
a whole super team
the mighty oink
squirrelverine
droolo
seriously droolo
and wait wheres
shellonwheels shell
whats happenin sweet cheeks
ah i get it
the strong silent type
who needs words
man i wish
i still had my powers
yeah what happened
to them anyway
i ate some green kryptonite
a kryptonians only weakness
why would you eat
your weakness you dumdum
it was in some cheese
a dogs only weakness
well i ate a toy dinosaur once
if were goin off that id say
you probably got a solid two days
until that thing passes
unless its a stegosaurus
and then you just pray
you guys look
mkay wonder woman
will stop her
goddess no
um
that sounded
like a bone breaking
is that even how it works
i guess its down to us
whos ready to go
save my best friend
you want us to fight her
she just took out
the whole justice league
and they all
have opposable thumbs
remember me
when im gone fabrizio
guys relax well be fine
why are they so mad
you see totally fine
now lets hero up
all right team
what are your stats
like my powers include
heat vision freeze breath
and dont forget
the solar paw punch
what is that
is that like a juice box
flavor or something
no its kryptos
most powerful move
it requires him
to fly directly to the sun
and absorb its deadly radiation
turning himself into
a dogshaped
thermal energy event
not even superman himself
has tried it
because he doesnt have paws
because its not something
you come back from
the punch causes a blast
which takes out
not only the villain
who gets hit with the blow
but the hero who throws it
sounds like a terrible power
does sound like
a good juice box though
i would drink the juice box
okay enough mayhem
thank you we gotta go
my goodness
look whos alive
well lets correct that
little oversight shall we
ace deploy canine shield
what is a canine
evade
excellent shielding
that seemed incredibly painful
anybody wanna switch powers
youre up pig
okay pb think big
squirrel light em up
no no no i cant
of course you can
i mean whats the worst
that could happen
i could hurt someone
or they could hurt me
or maybe me freezing like this
is the worst thing
turtle use your speed
and get them
on it
where the am i
you guys are
terrible superheroes
i dont understand
why youre not getting this
yeah well theres a lot that you
dont understand about us you fool
maybe if you
paid attention to huh
oh im paying attention
help
onehundo percent attention
so thick and swole his abs
his abs
risky move for a dog
with no powers
some would say heroic
i would say dumb
where is superman
im not telling
classic evil
lex would be so proud
this is really about lex luthor
dont you understand
he was testing on you
we were colleagues
we were scientists together
you were the guinea pig
your hair fell out
yeah just like his did
lex needed me
thats more than i can say
for your superman
superman needed me
he he needs me
does he
because im pretty sure
hes gonna get
everything he needs from his
fiancee
oh no
you didnt know
they were getting married
i really am sorry
cause this must be
so painful to have to
hear this from me
no youre lying
am i huh
well then why
did this little bauble
fall out of his underoos
the night i took him down
look at it
the cuts fine but the clarity
is murky as heck
face it wonder mutt
youre too late
your boys getting hitched
and that means
byebye dog
but dont worry
if superman doesnt have room
in his life for you anymore
im sure you can uh crash
at the hall of justice
wow
she threw that dog real far
you know whats funny
for a minute i was worried
when i saw that the orange
kryptonite gave you powers
but then i remembered
uh youre you
come on lets go
little piggies
what did i tell you isnt
this better than spanish class
si
hey lois lane
always nice to see ya
talk lex
i know youre behind this
impressive destruction
but not my work
your name is literally
on the monster
looks like one of my
little babies is all grown up
thats creepy
spill it lex what have
you done with superman
wherever superman is
its got nothing to do with me
or my company
lexcorp international
hey stop chewing
on that batarang
bruce wayne paid a lot
of money for that
and then gave it to me
as a present
vic can you override
their defenses
i cant do anything
while they got me
stuck in airplane mode
all those protocols
for an alien invasion
nothing for little furballs
these quadrupedal land maniacs
have made a giant mistake
messing with the king of
oh whoa
hey hold on
is that fish food
aw someone was hungy
lex luthor denies involvement
but is quote team bad guy
luckily supermans dog
is on our team
krypto
of course supermans dog
he makes out with hell save us
no
he doesnt have his powers
but those other animals do
and and like cant krypto work
with them to to save metropolis
yeah about that
hes not the greatest
with other animals
he better get it together soon
or those ferrets
are gonna take over the world
is he okay
looks like hes still breathing
yep hes alive
pay up dog
you bet on if i was alive
nope i bet on
if you were dead
i bet you were horribly maimed
what a fun game
hey
so what uh
what is this place anyway
is this some type of fancy dmv
are you kidding
its the hall of justice
this is where
the justice league hangs out
i bet theyre all
super tight buds
and they like
try on each others clothes
and then they eat like
really fun snacks
and then they probably just
tell each other everything
yeah everything
he seems sad and defeated
so it is a dmv
maybe one of us
should go talk to him
not it
ace you always know
what to say
watch out for the
invisible jet
i just want to be alone
this is the best place
to watch the sunset
you wanna be alone why
dont you go someplace uglier
besides dont you
wanna save your superman
of course i do
hes my best friend
at least i thought he was
things are changing so fast
he didnt even tell me
he was getting married
thats whats got your leash
all twisted huh
yeah well
people are complicated
how would you know
nah forget it
you had an owner
right thats your business
i am not gonna pry
was he nice
they
my owner was a family
a mom
a dad
and her
ace what you did
for that little girl
nah it was nothin
i just did
what any dog would do

i dont blame them
they were just
protecting their kid
but you saved her

a thing about it
why not
well when you love somebody
and i mean
you really love them

to do anything for em
even if that means
letting them go
even if it hurts
especially then
you know what they say
about dogs dont you

youre still learning
your powers
every hero struggles like this
until they have
their training montage
theyre gonna
need a longer montage

youd understand
you know i had a cheetah
once but she ate my landlord
and tore up my couch

on the planet oa
i thought i had a pet raccoon
but he thought we were dating
all the creatures of the sea
are my friends
except for that one eel
who knows what he did
yeah im not really
an animal guy
oh are you allergic or
as a child i fell into
a well filled with bats
i can still hear the screams
as their dark wings
flapped around me
scratching my chubby
childish flesh
im tormented
every waking moment
i really think a pet
would be good for you
i got lulus scent
shes this way
well look at you being a dog
also the prisoners
had egg salad for lunch
and down that hall
oh dang

to the teacher

lex will pay for what hes done
right alongside
the justice league
you wont get away with this
i say this with love
you are all losers
youve always been losers
and youll continue to be losers
until the end
of your loser lives
oh and krypto
ill be sure to say goodbye
to superman for you
well well well
if it isnt the justice league
captured by me
entirely on my own
the guinea pig
did literally everything
yes gotta admit
doesnt feel great
but its all worth it
because you chumps
are going down for good
its no use
these cells were designed
to keep anyone
with powers from escaping
youd have to be as strong as
superman to get out
well we cant just give up
theres a difference
between giving up
and knowing when its over
mmmmm no way
not for superheroes
im not a superhero
im not even a good dog
when i was a puppy
i promised
id watch over superman
and i failed
all because i was jealous
of lois
who wouldnt be
have you seen those bangs
babang
superman was my only friend
and i was afraid to lose that
but you cant blame yourself
im the only one to blame
if i really was his friend
id have been there for him
no matter what
my father was right
my problem is me
im sorry

your lives for my mistake
