like clockwork  carl will try
to flirt with patty 
ooh  is that new perfume 
it s cat pee 
and have zero game 
giving this handsome canine
just enough time to   
what you doin   ace 
i m bustin  loose  pb 
sick of this
whole cage situation 
oh  my goddess 
this is just
like when wonder woman
used her bracelets of submission
to escape doctor poison s
secret hideout 
like    this

what if the rescue lady
catches you 
and locks you in the back room 
where they only listen

the rescue lady s coming 
thanks  merton

that s a good catch 
i m rooting for you  ace 
but don t you wanna get adopted
and feel the warm embrace
of a middle aged person
who lives alone 
yeah  who will be
your new best friend 
you re my best friends  dummies 
and you re all coming
with me to the farm 
i love when he talks
about the farm 
the farm upstate 
an untamed paradise
where animals run free
and they love and protect
one another 
and the lettuce grows on trees 
no shelter lady
watching our every move  nope 
it s a 100  animal farm 
that doesn t sound
ominous at all 
it s perfect 
and when i get us
all outta here 
well  that s where
we re gonna go 
the dog is right 
he should seek his freedom 
you see that  lulu gets it 
and he must destroy
all who stand in his way 
wow  well 
that just took a turn 
you may kid yourself
with your silly farm 
but i have the device 
for  one day soon 
when the stars align 
the device will bring me
ultimate power
and i will be more than free 
 will be more than free  
exactly 
lulu  whatever they tested
on you in that lab 
left you a few
guineas short of a pig 
that device
is just a pile of garbage 
you fear my brilliance 
recede into shadows 
recede into shadows

and together
we were two scientists
searching for ultimate power 
of course  there were missteps
along the way 
the red kryptonite
made my hair fall out 
luckily  i had the bone
structure to pull it off 
purple gave me
uncomfortably vivid dreams 
but the orange   
we knew the orange
would be different 
and we had a plan 
until krypto the super dog
had to come and ruin it 
stupid name  named after
his planet  oh  real creative

my fellow  furrier  guinea pigs 
i have sought you out

thwarted by the justice league 
lex luthor now
finds himself behind bars 
i ll destroy you all 
that s my best friend

best friend and mentor

fearsome super powered criminals 
stryker s island

inescapable prison 
which is where
you dorks come in

yeah  i mean 
we get summers off 
all you can drink water

hmm 
what s going on 
that was your cue to attack 
uh    oh  sorry  i    i was
waiting for him to go first 
yeah  but if i went first 
your fire would melt my ice 
so maybe the    the wing lady
should go first 
i have a name 
but then i d set
her wings on fire 
and i don t think
any of us want that 
well  you don t want
ice on wings

i have you in my lasso of truth 
oh  you want the truth 
the boots are a bit much 
is this really the best way
to find superman 
because to me 
this just seems gross 
what do you mean  gross 
smelling stuff is one of the
greatest joys of being a dog 
next to licking
any part of your body 
i mean  i lick myself
all the time 
well  that explains the breath 
you wanna find lulu and
rescue captain hair gel  right 
well  i suggest
you start sniffing 
you know what they say 
smell is the sight of the nose 
no one says that 
well  they should  check it 
uh huh 
a poodle drooled right here 
someone threw a perfectly good
pizza crust in that dumpster right there 
and on that corner   
that corner
right there    oh  no  dang 
a pigeon got her heart broken 
i can still smell the hurt 
she was a heavy crier 
it s a superpower
that every dog possesses 
even a wack one like you 
i m not wack 
oh 
ooh  is that a band aid 
  it s walk o clock 
  what oh what 
  nothing 
  okay

a super adorable nickname
you got for your walks
with your owner 
all right  maybe this is when
me and supes used to hang out 
every morning 
since i was a puppy 
aw  well  you might
not have your superman 
but at least you have us 
a whole super team 
the mighty oink 
squirrelverine 
droolo

unless it s a stegosaurus 
and then you just pray 
you guys  look

like a bone breaking 
is that even how it works 
i guess it s down to us

she just took out
the whole justice league 
and they all

you see  totally fine 
now  let s hero up 
all right  team 
what are your stats 
like  my powers include
heat vision  freeze breath   
and don t forget
the solar paw punch 
what is that 
is that like a juice box
flavor or something 
no  it s krypto s
most powerful move 
it requires him
to fly directly to the sun
and absorb its deadly radiation 
turning himself into
a dog shaped
thermal energy event 
not even superman himself
has tried it 
because he doesn t have paws 
because it s not something
you come back from 
the punch causes a blast
which takes out
not only the villain
who gets hit with the blow 
but the hero who throws it 
sounds like a terrible power 
does sound like
a good juice box  though 
i would drink the juice box 
okay  enough mayhem 
thank you  we gotta go   
my goodness 
look who s alive 
well  let s correct that
little oversight  shall we 
ace  deploy canine shield 
what is a canine    
evade 
excellent shielding 
that seemed incredibly painful 
anybody wanna switch powers 
you re up  pig 
okay  pb  think big 
squirrel  light  em up 
no  no  no  i can t 
of course you can 
i mean  what s the worst
that could happen 
i could hurt someone 
or they could hurt me 
or maybe me freezing like this
is the worst thing 
turtle  use your speed
and get them   
on it 
where the am i 
you guys are
terrible superheroes 
i don t understand
why you re not getting this 
yeah  well  there s a lot that you
don t understand about us  you fool 
maybe if you
paid attention to    huh 
  oh  i m paying attention 
  help 
one hundo percent attention 
so thick and swole  his abs 
his abs 
risky move for a dog
with no powers 
some would say heroic 
i would say dumb 
where is superman 
i m not telling 
classic evil 
lex would be so proud 
this is really about lex luthor 
don t you understand 
he was testing on you 
we were colleagues 
we were scientists together 
you were the guinea pig 
your hair fell out 
yeah  just like his did 
lex needed me 
that s more than i can say
for your superman 
superman needed me 
he    he needs me 
does he 
because i m pretty sure
he s gonna get
everything he needs from his   
fiancee 
oh  no 
you didn t know
they were getting married 
i really am sorry 
 cause this must be
so painful to have to
hear this from me 
no  you re lying 
am i  huh 
well  then why
did this little bauble
fall out of his underoos
the night i took him down 
look at it 
the cut s fine but the clarity
is murky as heck 
face it  wonder mutt 
you re too late 
your boy s getting hitched 
and that means   
bye bye  dog 
but don t worry 
if superman doesn t have room
in his life for you anymore 
i m sure you can  uh  crash
at the hall of justice 
wow 
she threw that dog real far 
you know what s funny 
for a minute  i was worried
when i saw that the orange
kryptonite gave you powers 
but then i remembered 
uh  you re you 
come on  let s go 
little piggies 
what did i tell you  isn t
this better than spanish class 
si 
hey  lois lane 
always nice to see ya 
talk  lex 
i know you re behind this 
impressive destruction 
but not my work 
your name is literally
on the monster 
looks like one of my
little babies is all grown up 
that s creepy 
spill it  lex  what have
you done with superman 
wherever superman is 
it s got nothing to do with me 
or my company 
lexcorp international 
hey  stop chewing
on that batarang 
bruce wayne paid a lot
of money for that 
and then gave it to me
as a present 
vic  can you override
their defenses 
i can t do anything
while they got me
stuck in airplane mode 
all those protocols
for an alien invasion 
nothing for little furballs 
these quadrupedal land maniacs
have made a giant mistake
messing with the king of   
oh  whoa 
hey  hold on 
is that fish food 
aw  someone was hungy 
lex luthor denies involvement 
but is quote  team bad guy  
luckily  superman s dog
is on our team 
krypto 
of course  superman s dog
he makes out with  he ll save us 
no 
he doesn t have his powers 
but those other animals do 
and    and like  can t krypto work
with them to    to save metropolis 
yeah  about that 
he s not the greatest
with other animals 
he better get it together soon 
or those ferrets
are gonna take over the world 
is he okay 
looks like he s still breathing 
yep  he s alive 
pay up  dog 
you bet on if i was alive 
nope  i bet on
if you were dead 
i bet you were horribly maimed 
  what a fun game 
  hey 
so  what  uh 
what is this place anyway 
is this some type of fancy dmv 
are you kidding 
it s the hall of justice 
this is where
the justice league hangs out 
i bet they re all
super tight buds 
and they  like 
try on each other s clothes
and then they eat  like 
really fun snacks 
and then they probably just
tell each other everything 
yeah  everything 
he seems sad and defeated 
so  it is a dmv 
maybe one of us
should go talk to him 
not it 
ace  you always know
what to say 
watch out for the   
   invisible jet 
i just want to be alone 
this is the best place
to watch the sunset 
you wanna be alone  why
don t you go someplace uglier 
besides  don t you
wanna save your superman 
of course i do 
he s my best friend 
at least i thought he was 
things are changing so fast 
he didn t even tell me
he was getting married 
that s what s got your leash
all twisted  huh 
yeah  well 
people are complicated 
how would you know 
nah  forget it 
you had an owner 
right  that s your business 
i am not gonna pry 
was he nice 
they 
my owner was a family 
a mom 
a dad 
and her 
ace  what you did
for that little girl   
nah  it was nothin  
i just did
what any dog would do 
and they just gave you away 
i don t blame them 
they were just
protecting their kid 
but you saved her 
and i d do it again 
worst day of my life 
but i wouldn t change
a thing about it 
why not 
well  when you love somebody 
and i mean 
you really love them 
you gotta be willing
to do anything for  em 
even if that means
letting them go 
even if it hurts 
especially then 
you know what they say
about dogs  don t you 
never feed us chocolate 
we love unconditionally 
excuse me  sir 
i am really bad at this 
that s just because
you re still learning
your powers 
every hero struggles like this 
until they have
their training montage 
they re gonna
need a longer montage 
those guys  well 
they suck visibly 
yes  i    i can agree
with you there 
but they re stronger
than you think 
pb just needs to love herself
as much as she loves
everyone else 
chip needs to feel safe 
and merton   
merton needs leafy greens 
you really know them  huh 
it s called listenin  
you learn a lot about someone
when you re locked up
with them forever 
wait a minute 
lulu was in the shelter
with you  too 
what did you learn about her 
all that guinea pig
ever talked about
was world domination
and some bald dude
with nice hands 
lex 
of course  stryker s island 
she must be going there
to spring him 
not if we get there first 
come on 
watch out for the   
invisible jet  yep 
maybe put up a sign 
or rope it off 
maybe some cones 
intruders  intruders 
adorable intruders

of our generation

should know about wonder woman 
praise be her name 
diana is fiercely independent 
completely her own woman 
and if you really
wanna be like her 
you ll be yourself 
i m gonna rip you
limb from limb 
okay  chip 
time to light that kitty up 
but what if the demonic
laser gato devours me 
or all of us 
or she only spares me 
and i forever
carry the guilt of survival 
chip  we all go to dark places 
i thought about throwing
lois lane in the ocean 
but you can t spend
the rest of your life
stuck in your own head 
you re right 
it is really scary in here 
okay  you can do this  chip 
get out of your head 
all right  let s get
to the bottom of merton 
it all started
in central city  1854 
i m just a sweet
little purr purr baby 
why won t you play with me 
and i had a whole period
in the  60s
where i was basically
a full time alchemist 
merton  we don t have time 
here  try these 
whoa

a missile was just shot
into my chest 
the threat was neutered 
thanks to krypto and friends 
this is amazing 
  yes  humanity is saved 
  no 
my baby made friends 
if you all had pets 
you d understand 
you know  i had a cheetah
once  but she ate my landlord 
and tore up my couch 
man  i loved that couch 
on the planet oa 
i thought i had a pet raccoon 
but he thought we were dating 
all the creatures of the sea
are my friends 
except for that one eel
who knows what he did 
yeah  i m not really
an animal guy 
oh  are you allergic or    
as a child  i fell into
a well filled with bats 
i can still hear the screams
as their dark wings
flapped around me 
scratching my chubby 
childish flesh 
i m tormented
every waking moment 
i really think a pet
would be good for you 
i got lulu s scent 
she s this way 
well  look at you being a dog 
also  the prisoners
had egg salad for lunch   
and down that hall   
oh  dang 
i think a robot guard
got his heart broken 
dolores

can be a little too specific 
lex  i m here

this ends now  rodent 
you were just defeated by

brring  brring

yeah  but if we work together 
we can get outta here
and save superman

you re a fool 
he ll only break your heart 
luckily  i m going
to do you a favor 
and destroy him
before he gets the chance 
what are you talking about 
oh  did i forget to mention
my evil plan s grand finale 
in 28 minutes 
the entire justice league
is gonna go kaboom 
if i can t have my guy

just one question 
how are you gonna stop me
when you re trapped in a cage 
you re trapped  too  genius 
yes  i know 
but just like at the shelter 
i always have an exit strategy 
hey  girl 
dish  queen

i never liked him 
lex will pay for what he s done 
right alongside
the justice league

i say this with love 
you are all losers 
you ve always been losers 
and you ll continue to be losers
until the end
of your loser lives 
oh  and krypto 
i ll be sure to say goodbye
to superman for you 
well  well  well 
if it isn t the justice league 
captured by me 
entirely on my own 
the guinea pig
did literally everything 
yes  gotta admit 
doesn t feel great 
but it s all worth it 
because you chumps
are going down for good 
it s no use 
these cells were designed
to keep anyone
with powers from escaping 
you d have to be as strong as
superman to get out 
well  we can t just give up 
there s a difference
between giving up
and knowing when it s over 
mm mmm  no way 
not for superheroes 
i m not a superhero 
i m not even a good dog 
when i was a puppy 
i promised
i d watch over superman 
and i failed 
all because i was jealous
of lois 
who wouldn t be 
have you seen those bangs 
ba bang 
superman was my only friend
and i was afraid to lose that 
but you can t blame yourself 
i m the only one to blame 
if i really was his friend 
i d have been there for him
no matter what 
my father was right 
my problem is me 
i m sorry 
nah  man  you re good 
you re just finally
being real with yourself 
you can t have justice
without truth 
thanks  ace 
but it s too late 
are you sure
about that  perrito

smell like sandalwood 
all right  time to save
the justice league 
let s crack some skulls 
no  you ve done enough 
um  say what now 
i started this
with one best friend to save
and now i have four more

i can t let you keep risking
your lives for my mistake 
but don t worry

has an emotional breakthrough 
gets his powers back 
and then bounces 
  i thought it was sweet 
  me  too 
i m medium on it  you know 
if i m honest 
time for the death of superman

then  why is it in my mouth 
superman 
black adam 
your owner s a hero  too 
antihero 
it s basically exactly like a
regular hero except way cooler 
you make up your own rules 
and then you break them 
also  you can ignore most moral
and ethical conventions
because no one can stop you 
yeah  that sounds
