and we all agreed
that the gifts were fabulous 
don t you cats know anything 
i hate mice 
i m allergic to cat tails
and catnip does nothing for me 
oh  my my my my my 
i guess we made a little mistake 
well  this is embarrassing 
the king will not be happy
when he hears about this 
i m sorry  did i hurt your feelings 
i overreacted  didn t i 
i ve just been on edge recently 
things have not been going well for me 
  what kind of things 
  i don t know  everything  you name it 
i m shocked to hear this 
but i suppose even pretty girls like you
have problems like everyone else 
  what  stop  that s enough 
  it is nowhere near enough 
the kingdom of cats has vowed not to
rest until you are completely satisfied 
  there s more 
  yes

tour of the spectacular kingdom of cats 
are you serious 
i m sure you ll love it there 
it s a marvelous place 
great food  fabulous scenery
and the entire cat kingdom
is ready to welcome you 
and that s not all 
the king is so taken with you 
he has awarded you the most
valuable gift in the cat kingdom 
you will become his daughter in law
and marry prince lune 
huh 
don t think
about trying to pull that one on me 
there is no way i can marry a cat 
the royal family
thinks you re good enough
and the prince is so cool 
  he s cool 
  hm mm 
hmm   
who knows  maybe i d fit in better
with a bunch of cats 
you get to lie around all day 
don t you 
  but of course 
  eat all the food you want 
take naps in the sun 
forget about all your problems 
but me getting married to a cat prince 
that s just ridiculous 
right  cat 
fantastic 
we ll collect you tonight  then 
no  i didn t agree to that 
hey  wait 
ow 
oh  i hurt 
okay  think  haru 
you gotta do something about this 
what can i do 
those cats are relentless 
they ll find a way to kidnap me
and i ll have to marry a cat

find the white cat
and go to the cat bureau  haru 
you ll need their help

good evening  welcome to the bureau
wow  you re cool 
thank you  you re now in a world

like me and toto there 
that s    that s   
that is toto 
a stone statue with a soul 
i see you have a visitor today  baron 
how unusual 
indeed  she s quite a fetching one  too 
did he say baron 
i am baron humbert von gikkingen 
the artisan who created me
gave me that title 
i ll just call you baron 
so  you say you re having trouble
with those cats from the cat kingdom

from getting hit by a truck 
and now they won t stop
trying to repay me

so she was stupid 
that s all i m saying 
where did you find her  muta

i ve ever tasted 
then you re lucky 
just tastes like boiled grass to me 
tea is too refined
for your crude taste buds 
at least i don t eat worms 
muta  have a seat and tell us
what you know about the kingdom of cats 
it s a dangerous place 
you shouldn t go there
if you don t believe in yourself

they said not only will they kidnap me 
they re going to force me
to marry prince lune 
so  do it  you ll be set for life 
  are you crazy 
  it might not be all that bad 
that s ridiculous 
  she won t know until she tries it 
  now  then

paying a visit to the kingdom of cats 
  now is the time 
  have a nice trip 
  hope you make it back some day 
  you re coming with me 
nah  i ll pass 
but thanks for thinking of me

the back of the castle

good luck 
and  baron  take good care of haru 
hey  wait

i never knew they were so useful 
nice shot  sire 
  oh no  you hit one of ours

  what s that way like 
  just dead ends

oh

besides  we have guards in the tower 
why didn t you say so 
toast 
whoa 
  i ll have a word with the contractors 
  it s too late for that 
we ll have to use the detonator 
not that  i beg of you  sire 
think of what it will do
to your approval ratings 
  button 
  i must have left it in the castle 
look what i found 
no  oh  no

not much further now 
bye bye  tower 
  baron 
  brace yourselves 
excellent explosion  your majesty 
let s go

nothing else we can do 
hut  hut  hut  hut   
quick  quick  get  em  get  em 
baron  nice to see you again 
princess  would you please
accompany me back to the castle 
being a cat s not so bad 
do i have to learn to eat mice 
perhaps you shouldn t give up
quite yet  haru 
what in the world has father done now 
father 
lune  you re back already 
the prince is here  line up 
it s the prince 
yuki sent a message
saying it was urgent i return 
perhaps you d like to tell me
what s going on 
miss haru 
  yuki  you re here 
  i m glad lune made it in time 
i just wanted to repay
the girl who rescued you 
and i thought  just maybe 
you would be happy
to have a good looking girl like haru
for a bride 
i have already chosen my bride 
i have decided to marry yuki 
that thing 
  guess it was a surprise 
  i like this prince 
this is for you  i traveled
to your old home to get these 
i haven t had these in years 
wow 
i used to love those when i was a kid 
i know  you fed me a whole box of these
when i was just a stray 
that filthy little kitten was you 
you re so beautiful now 
i never would have recognized you 
yuki  will you accept these crackers
as a symbol of my love for you
for as long
as our nine lives shall last 
so these crackers mean that
you can marry the prince instead of me 
i m so happy for you 
thank you  haru 
thank you for feeding me
when i was a kitten 
without you
i might not be alive today 
you re the girl with the fish crackers
yuki told me about 
and you also rescued me
when i nearly got killed by a truck 
we both owe you our lives  haru 
what can we do to repay you 
you don t have to repay me 
i m just glad things turned out so well 
i guess i did the right thing after all 
this is all very moving 
i had no idea
you had a bride in mind already 
you should ve told me 
poor haru 
you must feel like such a loser 
  not really 
  i m sure you do 
so  i have a great idea 
you should marry me instead 
i ll get you some fish  too  as a symbol
of my undying love and all that 
so

in other people s business 
so i  renaldo moon  will defend her 
  renaldo 
  renaldo moon 
  the renaldo moon 
  so that s who he is 
  who 
  how could you have forgotten 
he s such a notorious criminal 
his story is written on our walls 
years back 
an enormous white cat appeared 
devoured all the fish in the lake
and then ran off 
he called himself renaldo moon 
did you really do that  muta 
that s disgusting 
and this time
i ll eat the entire castle 
hurry  get his majesty to safety  now 
protect haru from the king 
yes  sir 
cat guard  advance 
oh  you traitor 
please  sire  it s not safe

how embarrassing 
i heard rumors
about a nosy cat figurine
who likes to help others
with their problems 
i assumed you d just be a kitschy
knick knack that collected dust 
had i known you were this good  i would
have asked you to come and work for me 
i prefer a life of sticking my nose
in other s problems 
where am i 
what have you done 
i didn t do anything 
the tower
is hundreds of feet shorter now 
i wouldn t be surprised
if the exit had moved as well 
  oh no  the exit moved 
  we should have foreseen this 
but  look  she s not a cat any more 
help me

from now on

  baron 
  spread your arms and look down

what are all these chickens doing here 
  a flock of crows 
  perfect timing 
so  muta  how does it feel to be saved
by a bunch of birdbrains 
toto 
  it sure took you long enough 
  nice work  toto 
i m just glad i had enough friends
hanging out in the area 
are you sure we re not too heavy 
  you re light as a feather  haru

i think i shall accompany you  sire 
thanks  toto 
oh boy  my heart is still pounding 
  scared  were you 
  yes  but i had fun  too 
really  i didn t 
well then 
now that haru s problem is solved 
we should let her go home
and get some rest 
catnap 
i guess this is goodbye 
one last chore to do 
baron  just for the record  i think
i may have a little crush on you 
just for the record  i admire a young
woman who speaks from the heart 
if you ever need us  you will always
know how to find us again 
and the bureau s doors will be open
to you  be it day or night 
until then  trust yourself 
goodbye 
i ll miss you
