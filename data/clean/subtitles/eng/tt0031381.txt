if anybody can give a girl

our good times must seem silly
to you  you re so serious 
oh  scarlett  you have so much life 
i ve always admired you 
i wish i could be more like you 
you mustn t flatter me
and say things you don t mean 
nobody could accuse melanie
of being insincere  could they  my dear 
she s not like you  is she  ashley 
he never means a word
he says to any girl 
why  charles hamilton 
you handsome old thing  you 
but  miss o hara  i   
was it kind to bring your good looking
brother here to break my poor heart 
now that charles is your beau 
she s after him like a hornet 
charles  i want to eat
barbecue with you 
don t go philandering with any other girl 
because i m mighty jealous 
i won t  miss o hara 
i couldn t 
i do declare  frank kennedy  you look
dashing with those new whiskers 
thank you  thank you  miss scarlett 
charles and wade asked me to eat with
them  but i told them i promised you 
you needn t be so amused 
she s after your beau now 
that s mighty flattering of you 
miss scarlett 
i ll see what i can do 
why s your sister mad 
you sparking her beau 
as if i couldn t do better
than that old maid in britches 
brent and stuart 
you handsome old things 
  i didn t mean it  i m mad at you 
  what have we done 
you haven t been near me all day 
i wore this old dress for you 
i was counting on eating with you 
  you are  scarlett 
  of course you are  honey 
i never can make up my mind
which of you is the handsomest 
i was awake all last night
trying to figure it out 
oh  shucks 
  cathleen  who s that 
  who 
that man looking at us and smiling 
the nasty dark one 
don t you know  that s rhett butler 
he s from charleston 
he has a most terrible reputation 
he looks as if he knows
what i look like without my shimmy 
my dear  he isn t received 
he spends his time up north
because his folks won t speak to him 
he was expelled
from west point  he s so fast 
and there s that business
about the girl he wouldn t marry 
tell  tell 
he took her out buggy riding in
the late afternoon without a chaperon   
and then he refused to marry her 
no  but she was ruined just the same 
ashley      happy    so happy 
you seem to belong here   
as if it had all been
imagined for you 
i like to feel that i belong
to the things you love 
  you love twelve oaks as i do 
  yes  ashley 
i love it as more than a house 
it s a whole world that wants only
to be graceful and beautiful 
it s so unaware
that it may not last forever 
you re afraid of what may happen
if the war comes 
but we don t have to be afraid for us 
no war can come into our world  ashley 
whatever comes  i ll love you   
just as i do now  until i die 
isn t this better than a table 
a girl hasn t got but two sides
to her at a table 
  i ll get her dessert 
  she said me 
allow me  miss o hara 
i think    hmm   
i think charles hamilton may get it 
thank you  miss o hara 
thank you 
go get it  boy 
isn t he the luckiest   
miss o hara   
i love you 
i don t guess i m as hungry
as i thought 
why do i have to take a nap 
i m not tired 
well brought up ladies
takes naps at parties 
it s time you behave and act
like you was miss ellen s daughter 
when we were in saratoga 
i didn t see yankee girls taking naps 
and you won t see no yankee
girls at the ball  neither 
how was ashley today 
he didn t pay much attention to you 
you mind your own business 
you ll be lucky you don t lose
whisker face kennedy 
you re sweet on ashley  and his
engagement s being announced tonight 
that s as much as you know 
you ought to behave yourself 
acting like poor white trash children 
if you s old enough for parties 
you should act like ladies 
who cares 
we ve borne enough insults
from the yankees 
we ll keep our slaves
with or without their approval 
 twas the sovereign right of
georgia to secede from the union 
the south must assert herself
by force of arms 
after we ve fired on the yankee rascals
at fort sumter  we ve got to fight 
  there s no other way 
  that s right 
let the yankees ask for peace 
the situation s very simple 
the yankees can t fight and we can 
there won t be a battle 
they ll turn and run 
  one of us can lick 20 yanks 
  we ll beat them in one battle 
gentlemen can always fight
better than rabble 
gentlemen always fight better 
what does the captain
of our troop say 
well  gentlemen 
if georgia fights  i go with her 
i hope the yankees let us
leave the union in peace 
ashley  they ve insulted us 
you can t mean you don t want war 
most of the miseries of the world
were caused by wars 
and when the wars were over 
no one ever knew what they were about 
now  gentlemen  mr  butler s
been up north  i hear 
don t you agree with us 
i think it s hard winning
a war with words 
what do you mean  sir 
there s not a cannon factory
in the whole south 
what difference does that make
to a gentleman 
it ll make a great difference
to a great many gentlemen  sir 
are you hinting
that the yankees can lick us 
no  i m not hinting 
i m saying plainly  the yankees
are better equipped than we 
they ve got factories 
shipyards  coal mines   
and a fleet to bottle up
our harbors and starve us 
all we ve got is cotton and slaves 
and arrogance 
i refuse to listen
to any renegade talk 
  i m sorry if the truth offends you 
  apologies aren t enough  sir 
i hear you were turned out
of west point  mr  rhett butler 
and you aren t received in
any family in charleston 
not even your own 
i apologize again
for all my shortcomings 
perhaps you won t mind if
i look over your place 
i seem to be spoiling everybody s
brandy and cigars   
and dreams of victory 
that s what you can expect
from somebody like rhett butler 
you did everything but call him out 
  he refused to fight 
  not quite there  charles 
  he refused to take advantage of you 
  take advantage of me 
he s one of the best shots in the country 
as he s proved many times 
  he s got steadier hands than yours 
  well  i ll show him 
please  don t go tweaking
his nose anymore 
you may be needed for more
important fighting 
if you ll excuse me 
mr  butler s our guest 
i think i ll just show him around 
ashley 
ashley   
scarlett 
who are you hiding from in here 
what are you up to 
why aren t you upstairs 
resting with the other girls 
what is this  scarlett  a secret 
oh  ashley   
ashley 
  i love you 
  scarlett 
i love you  i do 
isn t it enough that you gathered
every other man s heart today 
you ve always had mine 
you cut your teeth on it 
don t tease me now 
have i your heart  my darling 
i love you  i love you 
you mustn t say such things 
you ll hate me for hearing them 
i could never hate you 
and i know you must care about me 
you do care  don t you 
yes  i care 
can t we go away
and forget we ever said these things 
but how can we do that 
don t you    
don t you want to marry me 
i m going to marry melanie 
but you can t 
not if you care for me 
oh  my dear  why must you make me
say things that will hurt you 
how can i make you understand 
you re so young  you don t
know what marriage means 
i know i love you 
and i want to be your wife 
you don t love melanie 
she s like me  scarlett 
she s my blood
and we understand each other 
but you love me 
how could i help loving you 
you have all the passion
for life that i lack 
that kind of love isn t enough
for two people as different as we are 
why not say it  you coward 
you re afraid to marry me 
you d marry that fool
who can only say   
 yes    no  and raise
a passel of mealy mouthed brats 
you mustn t say that 
who are you to tell me i mustn t 
you led me on 
  you made me believe you d marry me 
  scarlett  be fair 
  i never at any time   
  you did  it s true  you did 
i ll hate you till i die 
i can t think of anything
bad enough to call you 
has the war started 
sir  you should have made
your presence known 
in the middle of that
beautiful love scene 
that wouldn t have been tactful 
would it 
but don t worry 
your secret is safe with me 
  sir  you are no gentleman 
  and you  miss  are no lady 
i don t hold that against you 
ladies never held any charm for me 
first you take advantage of me 
then you insult me 
i meant it as a compliment 
i hope to see more of you  when
you re free of the spell of mr  wilkes 
he doesn t strike me as good
enough for a girl of your   
what was it 
your  passion for living  
how dare you 
you aren t fit to wipe his boots 
and you were going to hate him
for the rest of your life 
she certainly made a fool
of herself running after all the men 
that s not fair  india 
she s so attractive 
men naturally flock to her 
melanie  you re just too good to be true 
  didn t you see her going after charles 
  and she knows charles belongs to me 
you re wrong  india 
scarlett s just high spirited
and vivacious 
men flirt with girls like that 
but they don t marry them 
i think you re being very mean to her 
miss o hara 
miss o hara 
mr  lincoln s called volunteers
to fight against us 
don t you men think
about anything important 
but it s war  everybody s going off
to enlist  i m going too 
everybody 
miss o hara  will you be sorry 
to see us go 
i ll cry into my pillow every night 
miss o hara  i told you i loved you 
you re the most beautiful girl in the
world  and the sweetest  the dearest 
i couldn t hope that you could love me 
i m so clumsy and stupid
and not nearly good enough for you 
but if you could think of marrying me 
i d do anything in the world for you 
just anything  i promise 
what did you say 
miss o hara  i said 
 would you marry me  
yes  mr  hamilton  i will 
you will  you ll marry me 
you ll wait for me 
  i don t think i d want to wait 
  you ll marry me before i go 
oh  miss o hara  scarlett 
  when may i speak to your father 
  the sooner the better 
i ll go now  i can t wait 
will you excuse me  dear 
dear 
mr  o hara  mr  o hara 
  it ll be a week before they call me 
  a week till they take you away from me 
oh  ashley 
i thought of you
at our wedding yesterday   
and i hoped yours
would be as beautiful 
  and it was 
  was it 
now we re really and truly sisters 
  charles 
  melanie 
don t cry  darling 
the war will be over in a few weeks 
and i ll be coming back to you 
miss scarlett 
i don t care 
i m too young to be a widow 
miss scarlett 
why  i d just go around
scaring people in that thing 
you shouldn t be around people 
you s in mourning 
for what  i don t feel anything 
why should i have to
pretend and pretend 
what is it 
oh  poor baby 
what is it 
my life is over 
  nothing will ever happen to me anymore 
  darling   
oh  mother 
i know you think i m horrible 
but i just can t bear
going around in black 
it s bad enough not being able to
go to parties  but looking this way too 
i don t think you re at all horrible 
it s only natural you want to look young
and be young when you are young 
oh  baby 
how would you like to visit somewhere 
savannah  perhaps 
what would i do in savannah 
well  atlanta then 
there s lots going on there 
and you can stay with melanie
and her aunt pittypat 
melanie 
yes 
yes  i could  couldn t i 
oh  mother  you re sweeter
than anybody in the world 
you d like it  really 
all right  then 
now stop your crying and smile 
you can take prissy with you 
start packing
miss scarlett s things  mammy 
i ll go write the necessary letters 
atlanta 
savannah would be better for you 
you ll get in trouble in atlanta 
what are you talking about 
you know what i s talking about 
i m talking about mr  ashley wilkes 
he ll come to atlanta for his leave
and you waiting for him just like a spider 
  he belongs to miss melanie   
  go pack my things like mother said 
they re all whispering 
and i know it s about her 
what s it matter  pittypat 
scarlett s living under my roof 
so they think i m responsible for her 
and for a widow to appear in public
at a social gathering   
every time i think of it  i feel faint 
you know scarlett came here
only to help raise money for the cause 
it was splendid of her
to make the sacrifice 
anyone hearing you talk would think
she came to dance instead of sell things 
ladies and gentlemen 
i have important news  glorious news 
another triumph
for our magnificent men in arms 
general lee has completely
whipped the enemy   
and swept the yankee army
northward from virginia 
and now  a happy surprise
for all of us 
we have with us tonight  that most
daring of all blockade runners   
whose fleet schooners 
slipping past the yankee guns   
have brought us here the very
woolens and laces we wear tonight 
i refer  ladies and gentlemen  to that
will o  the wisp of the bounding main 
none other than our friend
from charleston   
captain rhett butler 
permit me 
captain butler  such a pleasure
to see you again 
i met you last at my husband s home 
that s kind of you to remember 
mrs  wilkes 
did you meet captain butler
at twelve oaks  scarlett 
yes  i    i think so 
only for a moment 
it was in the library 
you had broken something 
yes  captain butler  i remember you 
ladies  the confederacy asks for your
jewelry on behalf of our noble cause 
we aren t wearing any 
we re in mourning 
wait 
on behalf of mrs  wilkes
and mrs  hamilton 
thank you  captain butler 
just a moment  please 
but it s your wedding ring  ma am 
it may help my husband more
off my finger 
thank you 
that was a very beautiful thing to do 
here 
you can have mine too 
for the cause 
and you  mrs  hamilton 
i know just how much that means to you 
melanie 
  dr  meade 
  i need your approval   
for something we want to do
that s rather shocking 
will you excuse us 
i ll say one thing  the war makes
the most peculiar widows 
i wish you d go away 
if you had any raising  you d know
i d never want to see you again 
now  why be silly 
you ve no reason for hating me 
i ll carry your guilty secret
to my grave 
i d be very unpatriotic to hate
a great hero of the war 
i declare  i was surprised you
turned out to be a noble character 
i can t bear to take advantage
of your little girl ideas 
i m neither noble nor heroic 
  but you are a blockade runner 
  for profit  and profit only 
you don t believe in the cause 
rhett butler is the only cause i know 
the rest doesn t mean much to me 
and now  ladies and gentlemen   
i have a startling surprise
for the benefit of the hospital 
gentlemen  if you wish to lead the reel
with the lady of your choice   
you must bid for her 
caroline meade  how can you let your
husband conduct this slave auction 
darlene merriwether 
how dare you criticize me 
melanie told the doctor that if it s
for the cause  it s quite all right 
she did 
oh  dear  oh  dear 
where are my smelling salts 
  i think i shall faint 
  don t you dare faint  pittypat 
if melanie says it s all right 
it is all right 
come  gentlemen 
do i hear your bids  make your offers 
don t be bashful  gentlemen 
twenty dollars  twenty dollars
for miss maybelle merriwether 
twenty five dollars
for miss fanny elsing 
only  25 to give your   
  one hundred and fifty dollars in gold 
  for what lady  sir 
for mrs  charles hamilton 
  for whom  sir 
  mrs  charles hamilton 
mrs  hamilton is in mourning 
but i m sure any of our atlanta belles
would be proud to   
dr  meade  i said
mrs  charles hamilton 
she will not consider it  sir 
oh  yes  i will 
my goodness gracious 
ooh  ooh 
choose your partners
for the virginia reel 
we ve shocked the confederacy 
it s like blockade running  isn t it 
it s worse  i expect
a very fancy profit out of it 
i don t care what you expect 
i m gonna dance and dance 
tonight i wouldn t mind dancing
with abe lincoln himself 
another dance and my reputation
will be lost forever 
with enough courage
you can do without a reputation 
oh  you do talk scandalous 
you do waltz divinely  captain butler 
don t start flirting with me 
i m not one of your plantation beaus 
i want more than flirting from you 
what do you want 
i ll tell you  scarlett
o hara  if you ll take
that southern belle
simper off your face 
someday i want you to say to me the
words i heard you say to ashley wilkes 
 i love you  
that s something you ll never hear
from me as long as you live 
how sweet  how kind 
he is a thoughtful gentleman 
why doesn t he say
something about my sacrifice 
oh  oh 
oh  the darling thing 
oh  rhett  it s lovely  lovely 
you didn t really bring it
all the way from paris just for me 
yes  i thought it was about time
i got you out of that fake mourning 
next trip i ll bring you some
green silk for a frock to match it 
  oh  rhett 
  it s my duty to our   
brave boys at the front to
keep our girls at home looking pretty 
it s so long since i had anything new 
how do i look 
awful  just awful 
why  what s the matter 
this war s stopped being a joke when
a girl doesn t know the latest fashion 
oh  rhett  let me do it 
but  rhett  i don t know
how i d dare wear it 
you will  though 
and another thing  those pantalets 
i don t know a woman in paris
who wears pantalets anymore 
what do they     you shouldn t
talk about such things 
you don t mind my knowing about them 
just my talking about them 
i can t go on accepting these gifts 
though you re awfully kind 
i m not kind  i m tempting you 
i never give without expecting
something in return  i always get paid 
i won t marry you
to pay for the bonnet 
don t flatter yourself 
i m not a marrying man 
well  i won t kiss you for it either 
open your eyes and look at me 
no  i don t think i will kiss you 
although you need kissing  badly 
that s what s wrong with you 
you should be kissed  and often 
and by someone who knows how 
and i suppose you think
you re the proper person 
i might be  if the right moment
ever came 
you re a conceited 
black hearted varmint 
i don t know why
i let you come and see me 
i ll tell you why  scarlett 
i m the only man over 16 and under 60
who s around to show you a good time 
but cheer up 
the war can t last much longer 
really  rhett  why 
there s a battle going on now
that ought to fix things   
     one way or the other 
  oh  rhett

when they do  i ll be with them 
  i m a little late  but better late   
  you must be joking 
selfish to the end  aren t you 
thinking of your own hide 
never a thought for the cause 
how could you do this to me 
and why should you go now that
it s all over  and i need you 
  why  why 
  why 
i ve always had a weakness
for lost causes  once they re really lost 
or maybe   
maybe i m ashamed of myself 
who knows 
you should die of shame
to leave me alone and helpless 
you  helpless 
heaven help the yankees
if they capture you 
now climb down here 
  i want to say goodbye 
  no 
climb down 
rhett  please don t go 
you can t leave me  please 
i ll never forgive you 
i m not asking you to forgive me 
i ll never forgive myself 
if a bullet gets me  i ll laugh
at myself for being an idiot 
there s one thing i do know 
and that is i love you  scarlett 
in spite of you and me and the world
going to pieces  i love you 
because we re alike 
bad lots  both of us 
selfish and shrewd  but able to look
things in the eye and call them by name 
don t hold me like that 
scarlett    look at me 
i love you more than
i ve ever loved any woman 
and i ve waited longer
for you than any woman 
let me alone 
a soldier of the south loves you 
wants your arms around him 
wants to carry the memory
of your kisses into battle 
never mind about loving me 
you re a woman sending a soldier
to his death with a beautiful memory 
scarlett  kiss me 
kiss me once 
you low down  cowardly 
nasty thing  you 
they were right  everybody was right 
you aren t a gentleman 
a minor point at such a moment 
here  if anyone lays a hand
on that nag  shoot him 
but don t make a mistake
and shoot the nag 
go on  i want you to go 
i hope a cannonball blows you
into a million pieces    
never mind the rest 
i follow your general idea 
and when i m dead on the altar of my
country  i hope your conscience irks you

there s something
i must speak to you about

i don t like the way
you re treating prissy and mammy 
you must be firm with inferiors 
but gentle with them  especially darkies 
i know  but i m not asking them to do
what i don t do myself 
nevertheless  i don t like it 
i shall speak to mrs  o hara about it 
  what are you doing out of bed

she must be more careful 
what a cool liar you are  melly 
we gotta get him out of here
and bury him 
if the yankees find him here   
i didn t see anyone else 
i think he must be a deserter 
even so  we ve gotta hide him 
they might hear about it 
and then they d come and get you 
i could bury him in the arbor
where the ground is soft   
but how will i get him
out of here 
  we ll both take a leg and drag him 
  you couldn t drag a cat 
scarlett   
would it be dishonest
if we went through his haversack 
i m ashamed i didn t think
of that myself 
you take the haversack 
i ll search his pockets 
you look  i m feeling a little weak 
i think it s full of money 
melly  look  just look 
ten  20  30   
don t stop to count it now 
we haven t got time 
do you realize this means we can eat 
look in his other pockets 
hurry  hurry 
we ve got to get him out of here 
if he bleeds across the yard 
we can t hide it 
give me your nightgown 
i ll wad it round his head

you d be a sight more humiliated
if mr  kennedy s lice gets on you 
oh  come on  beau 
we must leave this gentleman alone
because he s tired and he s hungry 
i don t mind  ma am

  don t scold me  scarlett 
i ve just heard that ashley
was taken prisoner 
  ashley a prisoner

is giving him some of her dinner   
and helping my beloved
to come back home to me 
  i hope so  melly 
  miss scarlett 
i want to take up something
with your pa  but he doesn t seem to

i m head of the house now 
well  i    i   
miss scarlett  i was aiming
to ask for suellen

for her after all these years 
the truth is  i m so much
older than she is   
and now i haven t
a cent to my name 
who has  nowadays 
miss scarlett  if true love
carries any weight with you   
you can be sure your sister

  all right  frank 
i m sure i can speak for pa

what seems to be
the trouble with mr  kennedy 
more trouble than he guesses 
he s finally asked for suellen s hand 
oh  i m so glad 
it s a pity he can t marry her now 
it d be one less mouth to feed 
oh  another one 
  hope this one isn t hungry 
  he ll be hungry 
i ll tell prissy to get
an extra plate   
ashley

well  i see d that old no count
white trash wilkerson   
that used to be
mr  gerald s overseer here 
he s a regular yankee now 
and he was making a brag   
that his carpetbagger friends run
the taxes way up sky high on tara 
  how much more we got to pay 
  i hear the taxman say  300 
three hundred    
it might just as well be 3 million 
but we gotta raise it  that s all 
yes m  how 
  i ll go ask mr  ashley 
  he ain t got no  300 
well  i can ask him
if i want to  can t i 
asking ain t getting 
ashley   
they say abe lincoln

just think what heights i may
climb to  once i get the knack 
ashley  the yankees
want  300 more in taxes 
what shall we do 
ashley  what s to become of us 
what becomes of people
when their civilization breaks up 
those with brains and courage
come through all right 
those that haven t are winnowed out 
for heaven s sake   
don t talk nonsense
when it s us being winnowed out 
you re right  scarlett  here i am
talking tommyrot about civilization   
while your tara is in danger 
you ve come to me for help 
and i ve none to give 
oh  scarlett  i m a coward 
you  ashley  a coward 
what are you afraid of 
mostly of life becoming
too real for me  i suppose 
not that i mind splitting rails 
but i do mind very much losing
the beauty of that life i loved 
if the war hadn t come  i d have spent
my life happily buried at twelve oaks 
but the war did come 
i saw my boyhood friends blown to bits 
i saw men crumple up in agony
when i shot them 
and now i find myself in a world
which for me is worse than death 
a world in which there s
no place for me 
i can t make you understand 
you don t know the meaning of fear 
you never mind facing realities 
you never want to escape
from them as i do 
escape 
ashley  you re wrong 
i do want to escape too 
i m so very tired of it all 
i ve struggled for food and for money 
i ve weeded  hoed and picked cotton
till i can t stand it 
i tell you  the south is dead 
it s dead 
the yankees and carpetbaggers
have it and left nothing for us 
oh  ashley   
let s run away 
we d go to mexico 
they want officers in the mexican army 
we d be happy 
i d work for you 
i d do anything for you 
you don t love melanie  you said
you loved me at twelve oaks 
and anyway  melanie can t   
dr  meade said she can t have
more children  i could give you   
can t we ever forget twelve oaks 
you think i could ever forget 
have you 
can you honestly say
you don t love me 
  no  i don t love you 
  it s a lie 
even so  do you think
i d leave melanie and the baby 
you couldn t leave
your father and the girls 
i m sick of them 
i m tired of them 
yes  you re sick and tired 
that s why you re talking this way 
you ve carried the load
for all of us 
from now on  i ll be more help
to you  i promise 
there s only one way you can help me 
take me away 
there s nothing to keep us here 
nothing 
nothing except honor

i couldn t sleep for thinking 
it s not true they ll hang you 
would you be sorry 
  oh  rhett 
  well  don t worry yet 
they trumped up a charge 
but they really want my money 
they think i made off
with the confederate treasury 
  well  did you 
  what a leading question 
let s not talk about things
like money 
how good of you to come and see me 
and how pretty you look 
how you do run on 
teasing a country girl like me 
thank heavens you re not in rags 
i m tired of women in rags  turn around 
you look good enough to eat 
and prosperous 
i ve been doing very well 
everyone s well at tara  only   
i got so bored  i thought
i d treat myself to a visit to town 
you re heartless 
but that s part of your charm 
you ve got more charm
than the law allows 
i didn t come to talk
silliness about me 
i was so miserable at the thought
of you in trouble 
i was mad at you when
you left me on the road to tara 
  and i still haven t forgiven you 
  don t say that 
well  i must admit i might not be
alive now  only for you 
when i think of myself
with anything i could possibly hope for   
not a care in the world 
and you here in this horrid jail 
and not even a human jail 
rhett  a horse jail

can what be possible  rhett 
that you ve grown a woman s heart 
a real woman s heart

it s well worth it 
you can drop the moonlight
and magnolia 
things have been going well at tara 
what ve you done with your hands 
  i went riding without my gloves   
  you ve been working like a field hand 
why did you lie

with all the good georgia pine
around atlanta  and all this building 
well  all that takes money 
miss scarlett   
and i gotta think
about buying a home 
why would you want a home 
for suellen to set up housekeeping 
here in atlanta 
you d want to bring her to atlanta 
there wouldn t be much help
in that for tara 
i don t know what you mean 
i don t mean a thing 
how d you like to drive me
to my aunt pitty s 
nothing d give me more pleasure 
you better stay to supper 
aunt pitty d be agreeable 
and i d like a long visit 
you act on me just like a tonic 
miss scarlett 
and will you tell me all the news   
of miss suellen 
what s the matter 
miss suellen s not ill  is she 
oh  no  no  i thought
surely she had written you 
i guess she was ashamed to write you 
she should be ashamed 
how awful to have such a mean sister 
you must tell me 
don t leave me on tenterhooks 
well  she s going to marry
one of the county boys next month 
she got tired of waiting 
was afraid she d be an old maid and   
oh  i m sorry to be
the one to tell you 
it s cold  and i left my muff at home 
would you mind if i put my hand
in your pocket 
but  melanie  you don t realize
what she s done 
she s gone and married
my mr  kennedy 
he s my beau and she s married him 
  she did it to save tara 
  i hate tara 
i hate scarlett  she s
the only thing i hate worse than tara 
it s all my fault 
i should ve committed robbery
to get that tax money for you 
i couldn t let you do
anything like that 
anyway  it s done now 
yes  it s done now 
you won t let me do
anything dishonorable   
yet you d sell yourself in marriage
to a man you didn t love 
you won t have to worry
about my helplessness anymore 
what do you mean 
i m going to new york 
i ve arranged
for a position in a bank 
but you can t do that 
i counted on you to help me start
a lumber business and   
i counted on you 
i don t know anything
about the lumber business 
you know as much as you do
about banking   
and i d give you half the business 
that s generous of you  scarlett 
but it isn t that 
if i go to atlanta
and take help from you again   
i d bury any hope
of ever standing alone 
oh  is that all 
you could gradually buy the business 
and then it would be your own and   
no  scarlett 
oh  ashley 
ashley 
scarlett 
scarlett  what is it 
ashley s so mean and hateful 
what have you done 
she wanted me to go to atlanta 
to help me start my lumber business 
and he won t help me 
how unchivalrous of you 
why  think  ashley  think 
if it hadn t been for scarlett 
i d have died in atlanta   
and maybe we wouldn t have
little beau 
when i think of her picking cotton
and plowing   
just to keep food in our mouths 
i could just   
oh  my darling 
all right  melanie 
i ll go to atlanta 
i can t fight you both 
come on  lift them feet 
there s your new mill hands 
mrs  kennedy 
the pick of all the best jails
in georgia 
  they look thin and weak 
  halt 
they re the best you can lease 
if you ll give johnnie gallegher
a free hand   
you ll get what you want
out of them 
all right  you re the foreman 
just keep the mill running
and deliver my lumber when i want it 
johnnie gallegher s
your man  miss  but remember   
no questions and no interference 
that s a bargain 
start in the morning 
come on  get a move on there 
but this isn t right  and you know it 
bad enough to be a businesswoman   
why do you complain 
you wouldn t own a mill
if i didn t take over 
but i didn t want the mill 
we couldn t buy it if you hadn t
pressed our friends for their debts 
isn t that right  ashley 
are you running
a charitable institution 
go back to the store  and go home
and take your medicine 
sugar  don t you think    
great balls of fire  don t bother me 
and don t call me  sugar  
all right  all right 
good night  ashley 
my  my 
she can get mad quicker
than any woman i ever saw 
i don t like to interfere   
but i wish you d let me hire
darkies and not use convicts 
we could do better 
darkies  pay would break us 
convicts are cheap 
if we give gallegher a free hand   
a free hand  that means
he ll starve and whip them 
didn t you see them 
some are sick 
how you do run on 
if i let you alone 
you d give them chicken   
and tuck them in with quilts 
i won t make money out of the
enforced labor and misery of others 
you didn t mind owning slaves 
that was different 
we didn t treat them that way 
i d have freed them
when father died   
if the war hadn t
already freed them 
oh  i m sorry  ashley 
do you forget what it s like
without money 
money is the most
important thing in the world 
i don t intend to be without it again 
i ll make enough the only way i know
how so the yankees can t take tara 
we re not the only southerners
who ve suffered 
look at all our friends  they re
keeping their honor and kindness 
and they re starving  i ve no use
for fools who won t help themselves 
i know what they say about me 
i don t care 
i ll befriend carpetbaggers
and beat them at their own game 
and you ll beat them with me 
that s it  pull it
a little over to that side 
  afternoon  mrs  kennedy 
  good afternoon 
  business is certainly growing 
  it certainly is 
you re doing business
with the people   
who robbed us  tortured us
and left us to starve 
all that s past 
i intend to make the best of things 
even if they are yankee things 
and do you know that dr  meade
actually saw her   
     peddling lumber to yankees herself 
  that isn t all 
it s shocking what she s doing
to my brother 
she s even taken to driving
her own buggy 
my dear mrs  kennedy 
my very dear mrs  kennedy 
i don t see how you have
the gall to face me 
you could ve had my millions
if you d just waited a while 
oh  how fickle is woman 
what is it you want 
i have things to do 
will you satisfy my curiosity on a point
which has always bothered me 
well  what is it 
tell me  do you never shrink
from marrying men you don t love 
how d you get out of jail 
why didn t they hang you 
oh  that  there s nothing much
that money won t buy 
i observe it s even bought you
the honorable mr  wilkes 
so you still hate ashley wilkes 
i believe you re jealous of him 
you still think you re the belle of the
county  the cutest trick in shoe leather 
  that every man is in love with you 
  let me by 
don t be angry 
tell me  where are you going 
  i m going out to the mill 
  through shantytown alone 
it s dangerous to drive alone
through all that riffraff 
don t worry about me 
i can shoot straight 
if i don t have to shoot too far 
what a woman 
give me a quarter 
let go of my horse 
hold this horse 
  let go 
  give me that gun 
help  help 
help 
help

and then after what happened to me 
frank went to a political meeting 
and if it won t pain you too much 
india wilkes

with any justice 
you d have gotten worse 
  india  hush up 
  let her talk  she s always hated me 
ever since i took charles away 
though she won t admit it 
if she thought anybody d notice 
she d walk the street naked 
i do hate you 
you ve done all you could to lower
the prestige of decent people 
now you ve endangered
the lives of our men   
because they ve got to   
india 
we d better not say any more 
or one of us will be saying too much 
what s going on
that i don t know about 
shh 
somebody s coming up the walk 
somebody that ain t mr  ashley 
will you hand me the pistol 
mrs  meade 
whoever it is

where have they gone 
tell me  it s life or death 
don t tell him 
he s a yankee spy 
quickly  there may be time 
  how d you know 
  i played poker with yankees 
they knew there d be trouble 
they sent the cavalry out 
your men are walking
into a trap

the old sullivan plantation 
they re meeting in the cellar 
i ll do what i can

if you don t tell me  i ll go crazy 
we thought it best not to tell you 
the men have gone to clean out
the woods where you were attacked 
it s what many of our southern men
have had to do to protect us 
and if they re captured  they ll be
hanged  and it will be your fault 
another word and you leave  india 
scarlett did what she had to do 
our men are doing

 the personal history and experience
of david copperfield 
chapter one 
i am born 
to begin my life with the beginning
of my life  i record that i was born    
 chapter nine 
i have a memorable birthday 
i pass over all that happened
at school   
until the anniversary
of my birthday came round in march 
except that steerforth was more to be
admired than ever  i remember nothing 
he was going away
at the end of the half year   
if not sooner  and was more
spirited and independent than before 
but beyond this 
i remember nothing 
the great    
 i remember nothing  
melly  they re drunk 
leave this to me  scarlett 
and  please  say nothing 
  you stupid fool 
  shh

hello  melly 
so you ve got my husband
intoxicated again  well  bring him in 
i m sorry

you must arrest a good many yankees 
bring him in  captain butler 
if you can walk yourself 
  wait 
  i wanna tell you a story 
listen  doctor  i   
put him down in that chair 
now  captain 
please leave my house   
and try to remember
not to come here again 
that s fine thanks i get
for bringing him home   
and not leaving him
in this shameful condition 
now  boys  all together   
dr  meade 
i m astonished at you 
oh  ashley 
how can you do this to me 
i ain t so very drunk  melly 
take him to the bedroom 
lay him out on the bed 
  don t touch him  he s under arrest 
  now  tom 
what do you want to arrest him for 
i ve seen him drunker 
i ve seen you drunker 
and you ve seen me   
he can lie in the gutter for all i care 
i m not a policeman 
he led a raid on that shantytown
where mrs  kennedy got into trouble 
a lot of shanties were burned 
a couple of men were killed 
it s time you rebels learned you can t
take the law into your own hands 
what are you laughing at 
this isn t your night to teach
that lesson 
these two have been
with me tonight  yes  sir 
with you  rhett 
where 
i don t like to say
in the presence of ladies 
you d better say 
come out on the porch
and i ll tell you 
speak out  i think i have a right
to know where my husband s been 
well  ma am   
we dropped in on a friend of mine   
and the captain s 
a mrs  belle watling 
we played cards
and drank champagne  and  well   
now you ve done it  did you have
to show me up in front of my wife 
now  i hope you re satisfied 
these ladies won t be speaking
with their husbands 
well  rhett  i had no idea 
look here  will you take an oath that
they were with you tonight at belle s 
ask belle if you don t believe me 
she ll tell you 
will you give me your word 
as a gentleman 
as a gentleman 
why  certainly  tom 
well  if i ve made a mistake 
i m sorry 
i hope you ll forgive me  mrs  wilkes 
if you ll leave us in peace 
well  i say i m sorry 
well  i am sorry 
come on  sergeant 
lock that door  pull down the shades 
  oh 
  ashley 
he s all right 
it s only in the shoulder 
get him on the bed
where i can dress the wound 
i think i can walk 
it s not worth the effort 
which way 
in here 
mammy  i want hot water 
and lint for bandages 
what can i use for a probe 
if i only had my bag 
were you really there 
what did it look like 
does she have cut glass chandeliers 
plush curtains and dozens of mirrors 
good heavens  mrs  meade 
remember yourself 
captain butler  tell me what happened 
all that happened 
i was too late 
when i got to the sullivan place 
there had already been a skirmish 
i found mr  wilkes wounded 
and dr  meade was with him 
i had to prove they d been somewhere 
anyplace but where they were 
  so i took them to belle s 
  and she took them in 
she s by way of being
an old friend of mine 
oh  i m sorry   
i m sorry i couldn t think up
a more dignified alibi 
this isn t the first time you ve come
between me and disaster 
it isn t likely that i d question
any device of yours 
and now i ll go and see
what dr  meade needs 
oh  ashley   
ashley   
have you no interest in what s
become of your own husband 
did frank go with you
to belle watling s 
no 
well  where is he 
he s lying out on decatur road   
shot through the head 
he s dead 
who is it 
it s mrs  watling 
oh  mrs  watling 
won t you come in the house 
oh  no  i couldn t do that 
mrs  wilkes 
you come in and sit a minute with me 
how can i thank you enough
for what you did for us 
i got your note saying you would
call on me and thank me 
why  mrs  wilkes 
you must have lost your mind 
i came as soon as it was dark to say
you mustn t think of any such thing 
why  i m   
well  you re   
it wouldn t be fitting at all 
it wouldn t be fitting for me to thank
a woman who saved my husband s life 
mrs  wilkes  there ain t never been
a lady nice to me like you was 
i mean  about the money
for the hospital 
i don t forget a kindness 
i thought about you being widowed
with a little boy   
if mr  wilkes got hung 
he s a nice little boy 
your boy is  mrs  wilkes 
i got a boy myself  so i   
you have  does he live    
oh  no  he ain t here in atlanta 
he ain t never been here 
he s off at school 
i ain t seen him since he was little 
anyways  if it had been that
mrs  kennedy s husband by hisself   
i wouldn t have lifted a finger 
no matter what rhett said 
she s a mighty cold woman   
prancing about atlanta by herself 
she killed her husband
same as if she shot him 
you mustn t say unkind things
about my sister in law 
oh 
please don t freeze me  mrs  wilkes 
i forgot how you liked her 
she just ain t in the same class with you 
and i can t help it if i think so 
well  anyways  i gotta be going 
i m scared somebody ll recognize
this carriage if i stay any longer 
that wouldn t do you no good 
and  mrs  wilkes  if you ever see me
on the street   
you don t have to speak to me 
i ll understand 
i should be proud to speak to you 
proud to be under obligation to you 
i hope we meet again 
oh  no  that wouldn t be fitting 
  good night  mrs  wilkes 
  good night  mrs  watling 
and you re wrong about mrs  kennedy 
she s brokenhearted about her husband 
whoa 
great balls of fire 
it s rhett 
captain butler s here 
i told him you was prostrate with grief 
tell him i ll be right down  mammy 
she says she s coming 
i don t know why she s coming 
but she s coming 
you don t like me  mammy 
don t you argue with me 
you don t  you really don t 
it s no good  scarlett 
  what 
  the cologne 
i don t know what you mean 
i mean you ve been drinking 
brandy  quite a lot 
well  what if i have 
is that any of your affair 
don t drink alone 
people always find out 
and it ruins a reputation 
what is it 
this is more than losing old frank 
oh  rhett  i m so afraid 
i don t believe it 
you ve never been afraid 
i m afraid now 
i m afraid of dying and going to hell 
you look pretty healthy 
and maybe there isn t any hell 
oh  there is  i know there is 
i was raised on it 
far be it from me to question
the teachings of childhood 
tell me what you ve done
that hell yawns before you 
i ought never to have married frank 
he was suellen s beau 
and he loved her  not me 
and i made him miserable 
and i killed him 
yes  i did  i killed him 
rhett  for the first time   
i m finding out what it is
to be sorry for something i ve done 
here  dry your eyes 
if you had it all to do over again 
you d do no differently 
you re like the thief
who isn t sorry he stole   
but he s terribly sorry
he s going to jail 
i m glad mother s dead 
i m glad she s dead
so she can t see me 
i always wanted to be like her 
calm and kind   
and sadly  i ve turned out
disappointing 
you know  scarlett  i think
you re on the verge of a crying jag 
so i ll change the subject
and say what i came to say 
say it  then  and get out 
  what is it 
  i can t go on any longer without you 
oh  you really are the most ill bred man
to come here at a time   
i made up my mind you were
the only woman for me   
the first day i saw you 
now you have a mill
and frank s money   
and won t come to me
as you did to the jail 
  so i see i shall have to marry you 
  i never heard of such bad taste 
would you be convinced
if i fell to my knees 
turn me loose and get out 
forgive me for startling you
with my impetuous sentiments   
my dear scarlett   
i mean  my dear mrs  kennedy 
but you must have noticed
that for some time   
the friendship i ve felt for you
has ripened into a deeper feeling 
a feeling more beautiful 
more pure  more sacred   
dare i name it  can it be love 
get up off your knees 
i don t like your common jokes 
this is an honorable proposal
of marriage   
made at what i consider
a most opportune moment 
i can t go all my life waiting
to catch you between husbands 
you re coarse and you re conceited 
and i think this conversation s
gone far enough 
besides  i shall never marry again 
oh  yes  you will 
and you ll marry me 
you  you 
i don t love you 
and i don t like being married 
ever think of marrying
just for fun 
marriage  fun 
fiddle dee dee 
fun for men  you mean 
do you want them to hear you 
you ve been married
to a boy and an old man 
why not try a husband of the right age 
with a way with women 
you re a fool  rhett butler   
when you know i shall always love
another man 
stop it  you hear me  stop it 
no more of that talk 
don t  i shall faint 
i want you to faint 
this is what you re meant for 
none of those fools
have kissed you like this 
your charles or your frank
or your stupid ashley 
say you re going to marry me 
say yes  say yes 
yes 
are you sure you meant it 
you don t want to take it back 
no 
look at me 
and try to tell me the truth 
did you say yes because of my money 
well  yes  partly 
partly 
well  you know  rhett 
money does help 
  and  of course  i am fond of you 
  fond of me 
if i said i was madly in love
with you  you d know i was lying 
  you say we have a lot in common   
  yes  you re right  my dear 
i m not in love
any more than you are 
heaven help the man
who ever really loves you 
what kind of ring would you like 
a diamond ring 
and do buy a great big one 
you ll have the biggest
and most vulgar ring in atlanta 
i ll take you to new orleans
for the most expensive honeymoon 
  that d be heavenly 
  i ll buy your trousseau for you too 
how wonderful   
but you won t tell anybody 
will you 
still the little hypocrite 
won t you kiss me goodbye 
you ve had enough kissing
for one afternoon 
you re impossible  you can go 
i don t care if you never come back 
but i will come back 
what are you thinking about  scarlett 
i m thinking about how rich we are 
i can keep the lumber business too 
yes  of course you can 
if it amuses you 
now that you re so rich  you can tell
everybody to go to the devil 
but you were the main one
i wanted to go to the devil 
don t scrape the plate 
i m sure there s more in the kitchen 
oh  rhett  can i have
a chocolate one stuffed with meringue 
if you don t stop being a glutton 
you ll get as fat as mammy 
and i ll divorce you 
it d be nice if you bought
something for mammy 
why should i buy her a present
when she called us both mules 
mules  why mules 
she said we could give ourselves air
and get slicked up like racehorses   
but we were just mules in horse
harness and we didn t fool anybody 
i never heard anything more true 
mammy s a smart old soul 
and one of the few people i know
whose respect i d like to have 
  i won t give her a thing 
  then i ll take her a petticoat 
my mammy said
when she went to heaven   
she wanted a red taffeta petticoat
so stiff that it d stand by itself   
and so rustley the lord would say
it s made of angels  wings 
she won t take it from you 
she d rather die than wear it 
that may be  but i m making
the gesture just the same 
wake up  wake up 
you were having another nightmare 
oh  rhett 
rhett  i was so cold
and hungry and so tired 
i couldn t find it  i ran through
the mist and i couldn t find it 
  find what  honey 
  i don t know 
i always dream the same dream 
and i never know 
it seems to be hidden in the mist 
darling   
oh  rhett  do you think i ll ever dream
that i found it  and that i m safe 
dreams don t work that way 
but when you get used
to being safe and warm   
you ll stop dreaming that dream 
and  scarlett  i m going to see
that you are safe 
rhett  would you do something for me
if i asked you 
you know i would 
will you take me away from here 
  don t you like new orleans 
  i love new orleans   
but i want to go home
and visit tara 
will you take me to tara 
yes  scarlett  of course i will 
we ll go tomorrow 
you get your strength
from this red earth of tara 
you re part of it
and it s part of you 
i d give anything to have tara
the way it was before the war 
would you 
go ahead and make it that way 
spend whatever you want 
make it as fine a plantation
as it ever was 
oh  rhett 
rhett  you are good to me 
can we still have our big new house
in atlanta 
yes  and it can be
as ornate as you want 
marble terraces 
stained glass windows 
won t everyone be jealous 
i want everybody who s been mean
to me to be pea green with envy 
i don t care  scarlett s hateful   
building that new house
just to show off 
and even taking our servants 
oh  darling  you mustn t think
unkindly of her 
she s made it possible for us
to keep tara  always 
yes  and what good is tara 
she s had three husbands 
and i ll be an old maid 
great jehoshaphat 
great jehoshaphat 
lordy  we sure is rich now 
that s ridiculous 
why can t i go in 
i m entitled to at least see
what my own child looks like 
you control yourself 
you ll be seeing it for a long time 
i d like to apologize
about its not being a boy 
oh  hush your mouth 
who wants a boy 
boys aren t any use 
don t you think i m proof of that 
have a drink of sherry 
mammy  she is beautiful  isn t she 
she sure is 
you ever see a prettier one 
miss scarlett was mighty near that
pretty when she come  but not quite 
have another glass 
mammy 
what s that rustling noise i hear 
lordy  that ain t nothing but my
red silk petticoat you done give me 
nothing but your petticoat 
i don t believe it  pull up your skirt 
mr  rhett  you is bad 
yea  lordy 
you sure took a long enough time
about wearing it 
yes  sir  too long 
no more mule in horse s harness 
mister rhett  miss scarlett
was bad telling you about that 
you ain t holding that
against old mammy  is you 
i don t hold it against you 
i just wanted to know 
have another glass 
here  take the whole bottle 
dr  meade says you can go in now 
captain butler 
this sure is a happy day to me 
i done diapered three generations
of this family s girls 
and it sure is a happy day 
oh  yes  mammy  the happiest days
are when babies come  i wish   
oh  mammy  she s beautiful 
what do you suppose they ll name her 
miss scarlett done told me
if it was a girl   
she was going to name it
eugenia victoria 
yes  she s a beautiful baby 
the most beautiful baby ever 
yes   
do you know that this is
your birthday 
that you re a week old today 
yes  i m going to buy her a pony 
the likes of which   
this town has never seen 
yes  i m going to send her to
the best schools in charleston 
yes  and her will be received by
the best families in the south 
and when it comes time
for her to marry   
well  she ll be a little princess 
certainly making a fool of yourself 
why shouldn t i 
she s the first person who s ever
completely belonged to me 
great balls of fire 
i had the baby  didn t i 
  it s melanie  may i come in 
  come in 
yes  come in and look at
my daughter s beautiful blue eyes 
most babies have blue eyes
when they re born 
don t tell him anything 
he knows everything about babies 
nevertheless  her eyes are blue
and they ll stay blue 
as blue as the bonnie blue flag 
that s it 
that s what we ll call her 
 bonnie blue butler  
try again  mammy 
twenty inches 
twenty inches 
i ve grown as big as aunt pitty 
you simply gotta make it 181 2 again 
you done had a baby 
and you ain t never gonna be
no 181 2 inches again 
there ain t nothing to do about it 
there is something to do about it 
i m just not going to get old and fat
before my time 
i just won t have any more babies 
i heard mr  rhett say
that he d be wanting a son next year 
tell captain butler i decided
not to go out 
i ll have supper in my room 
i got your message 
i ll have them bring
my supper up here too 
no objections to that  i hope 
no 
yes  uh   
i mean  i don t care
where you have your supper 
rhett   
  yes 
  you see    well  i ve decided   
well  i hope i don t have
any more children 
my pet  as i told you
before bonnie was born   
it s immaterial to me
whether you have one child or 20 
no  but you know what i   
do you know what i mean 
i do  and do you know
i can divorce you for this 
you re low enough to think of that 
if you had any chivalry in you 
or were nice   
look at ashley wilkes  melanie can t
have any more children and he   
you ve been to the lumber office
this afternoon 
what has that got to do with it 
quite the little gentleman  ashley 
pray  go on  mrs  butler 
it s no use  you wouldn t understand 
  you know  i m sorry for you  scarlett 
  sorry for me 
yes  sorry for you because you throw
away happiness with both hands   
and reach out for something
that ll never make you happy 
i don t know
what you re talking about 
if you were free and melly were dead
and you had your precious ashley   
do you think you d be happy 
you d never know him 
never even understand his mind   
any more than you understand
anything  except money 
never mind about that  i want   
you may keep your sanctity 
it ll work no hardship on me 
you don t care 
the world is full
of many things and people   
and i shan t be lonely 
i will find comfort elsewhere 
well  that s fine 
but i warn you  in case you change
your mind  i intend to lock my door 
why bother 
if i wanted to come in 
no lock could keep me out 
i knew most women were cheats   
hypocritical and hard 
but this one   
  it ain t no use 
  what do you mean 
i mean you re poisoned with her 
i don t care what she s done to you 
you re still in love with her 
  it pleasures me none to say it 
  maybe so  but i m through with her 
you ve gotta think of the child 
child s worth 10 of the mother 
you re a shrewd woman  belle 
and a very nice one 
yes  rhett 
i was just thinking of the difference
between you and   
you re both hardheaded businesswomen 
and successful 
but you ve got a heart  belle 
and you re honest 
goodbye  rhett 
goodbye  belle 
she ll be a wonderful horsewoman 
look at those hands  and that seat 
oh  fiddle dee dee 
why we have to wheel a baby
when we have servants   
  good morning  mrs  merriwether 
  captain butler 
good morning  scarlett 
making fools of ourselves
in front of these buffaloes 
if you d thought of your position 
you wouldn t have to 
but as it is  we re going to cultivate
every female dragon of the old guard   
  good morning  mrs  whiting 
  captain butler 
good morning  scarlett 
so the millionaire speculator
is turning respectable 
money can t buy
what i want for bonnie 
i ll admit i ve been at fault too 
bonnie will have a place
among decent people 
even if we both have to crawl
on our bellies to every fat old cat   
good morning  mrs  meade 
good morning  captain
butler  good morning  scarlett 
mrs  merriwether  i have
great regard for your knowledge 
  could you give me some advice 
  why  certainly 
my bonnie sucks her thumb 
i can t stop her 
you should make her stop 
it ll ruin the shape of her mouth 
i know  i know 
she has such a beautiful mouth too 
  i tried putting soap on her nails 
  soap  bah 
put quinine on her thumb and
she ll stop sucking it quick enough 
quinine  i never would have
thought of it 
i can t thank you enough 
you ve taken a great load off my mind 
good morning 
good morning  dolly 
wasn t that captain butler 
good morning  caroline 
i was just thinking   
there s a great deal of good in
a man who would love a child so much 
but of course there is 
fanny elsing told dr  meade that
captain butler finally admitted   
that he was honored for his
services at the battle of franklin 
no  and did i tell you
that captain butler made   
a stupendous contribution to the
association for the beautification   
     of the graves of the glorious dead 
  no 
my grandbaby  napoleon picard 
is giving a party for bonnie next week 
why  dolly merriwether  it was
my idea to give a party for bonnie 
why  caroline meade 
how can you say a thing like that 
watch daddy put your pony
over it  bonnie  now  watch 
daddy  let me  let me 
all right  darling 
put her on  pork 
up we go 
oh  there 
lordy mercy

grip tightly with your legs 
lean forward and go with him 
hold your reins properly
in a firm hand  up 
that was fine  i knew you d do it 
when you re older 
i ll take you to kentucky and virginia 
you ll be the best horsewoman
in the south  give your daddy a kiss 
mr  rhett  mr  rhett 
mr  rhett 
did you see her 
wasn t she wonderful 
mr  rhett  i done told you
and told you   
it just ain t fittin  for a girl to ride
astraddle with her dress flying up 
all right  i ll teach her
to ride sidesaddle 
and i ll buy her a blue velvet
riding habit  she ll love that 
a nice black broadcloth
is what little girls wear 
oh  now  mammy  be reasonable 
well  i don t think it s fittin   but   
it ain t fittin   it just ain t fittin  
it ain t fittin  
why  scarlett  what are you
doing downtown at this time of day 
well  ashley  i just   
why aren t you helping melly
with my surprise birthday party 
why  ashley wilkes  you aren t
supposed to know anything about that 
melly d be so disappointed
if you weren t surprised 
i won t let on 
i ll be the most surprised man
in atlanta 
as long as you re here 
let me show you the books   
so you can see how bad
a businessman i am 
don t let s fool with any books today 
when i m wearing a new bonnet   
all the figures i ever knew
go right out of my head 
figures are well lost when
the bonnet s as pretty as that 
scarlett  you know 
you get prettier all the time 
you haven t changed a bit since
our last barbecue at twelve oaks   
where you sat under a tree
surrounded by dozens of beaus 
that girl doesn t exist anymore 
nothing s turned out as i expected 
ashley  nothing 
yes  we ve traveled a long road
since the old days  haven t we 
oh  the lazy days   
the warm  still 
country twilight   
the high  soft negro laughter
from the quarters   
the golden warmth and security
of those days 
don t look back  ashley 
don t look back 
it drags at your heart till   
you can t do anything
but look back 
i didn t mean to make you sad 
my dear 
i never want you to be anything
but completely happy 
oh  ashley 
  who is it 
  only your husband 
come in 
am i actually being invited
into the sanctuary 
you re not ready for melanie s party 
i ve got a headache  rhett 
you go without me
and make my excuses to melanie 
what a white livered
little coward you are 
get up  you re going to that party
and you ll have to hurry 
  has india dared    
  yes  india has 
  everyone in town knows the story 
  kill them for spreading lies 
i don t kill people who tell the truth 
no time to argue 
i won t go  i can t go until
this misunderstanding clears up 
you won t cheat melly out of publicly
ordering you out of her house 
there was nothing wrong 
india hates me so  i can t go 
if you don t show your face tonight 
you ll never be able to again 
i don t care  but you won t ruin
bonnie s chances 
you re going to that party 
for her sake  get dressed 
wear that  nothing modest
or matronly will do for this occasion 
and put on plenty of rouge 
i want you to look your part tonight 
for he s a jolly good fellow
for he s a jolly good fellow
for he s a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny
  good night  scarlett 
  but  rhett   
you re going into the arena alone 
the lions are hungry 
don t leave me  don t 
you re not afraid 
what a lovely dress  darling 
india wasn t able to come 
will you be an angel 
i do need you to help me
receive my guests 
mrs  meade   
here s our darling scarlett 
  good evening 
  good evening 
  why  scarlett 
  good evening 
ashley  aren t you going to get
our scarlett a glass of punch 
did you have a good time
at miss melly s party 
yes  now  mammy 
be sure and leave word 
if captain butler asks for me
when he comes back  i m asleep 
yes m 
come in  mrs  butler 
come here 
sit down 
no reason you shouldn t
have a nightcap  even if i am here 
i didn t want a drink 
i heard a noise   
you heard nothing of the kind 
you wouldn t have come
if you thought i was here 
  you must need a drink badly 
  i do not 
take it  don t give yourself airs 
i know you drink on the quiet 
and i know how much you drink 
do you think i care
if you like your brandy 
  you re drunk and i m going to bed 
  i m very drunk   
and i intend getting still drunker
before the evening s over 
but you re not going to bed 
not yet 
sit down 
so she stood by you  did she 
how s it feel to have the woman
you ve wronged cloak your sins 
you re wondering if she knows
all about you and ashley 
you re wondering if she did it
just to save face 
you re thinking she s a fool for doing it 
even if it saved your hide   
  i will not listen 
  yes  you ll listen 
miss melly s a fool 
but not the kind you think 
she has too much honor to conceive
of dishonor in anyone she loves 
and she loves you 
though just why she does 
i m sure i don t know 
if you weren t so drunk and insulting 
i could explain everything 
  as it is  though   
  you get out of that chair once more   
of course  the comic figure in all this
is the long suffering mr  wilkes 
mr  wilkes  who can t be
mentally faithful to his wife   
and won t be unfaithful to her
technically 
  why doesn t he make up his mind 
  rhett  you   
observe my hands  my dear 
i could tear you to pieces with them 
and i d do it if it d take
ashley out of your mind forever 
but it wouldn t 
so i ll remove him
from your mind forever  this way 
i ll put my hands so 
one on each side of your head 
and i ll smash your skull
between them like a walnut 
and that ll block him out 
take your hands off me 
you drunken fool 
you know  i ve always admired
your spirit  my dear 
never more than now 
when you re cornered 
i m not cornered 
you ll never corner me or frighten me 
you ve lived in dirt so long 
you can t understand anything else 
you re jealous of something
you can t understand 
good night 
jealous  am i 
yes  i suppose i am 
even though i know you ve been
faithful to me all along 
how do i know 
because i know ashley wilkes
and his honorable breed 
they re gentlemen 
that s more than i can say
for you or for me 
we re not gentlemen 
and we have no honor  have we 
it s not that easy  scarlett 
you turn me out while you chase ashley 
while you dream of ashley 
this is one night
you re not turning me out 
how are you feeling this morning 
well  this misery in my back   
ain t so good 
you act mighty happy this morning 
i am  mammy  i am 
oh  she wept with delight
when he gave her a smile
and trembled with fear at his frown
hello 
i  um   
i d like to extend my apology
for my conduct of last night 
oh  but  rhett 
i was very drunk   
and quite swept off my feet
by your charms 
you needn t bother to apologize 
nothing you do surprises me 
i ve been thinking  and i believe
it would be better for both of us   
if we admitted we made a mistake
and got a divorce 
  a divorce 
  yes 
there s no point in holding on
to each other 
i ll provide for you 
you ve plenty of grounds 
just give me bonnie 
and you can say what you please 
thank you  but i wouldn t dream of
disgracing the family with a divorce 
you d disgrace it
if ashley were free 
makes my head spin to think
how quickly you d divorce me 
wouldn t you 
answer me  wouldn t you 
please go now and leave me alone 
i m going  that s what i came
to tell you 
i m going on a very extended trip
to london 
  and i m leaving today 
  oh 
i m taking bonnie with me 
please get her duds packed right away 
you ll never take my child
out of this house 
she s my child too  you re mistaken
if you think i m leaving her here   
with a mother who doesn t
consider her reputation 
you re a fine one to talk 
you think i ll let her out when you ll
have her around people like belle 
if you were a man 
i d break your neck for that 
i ll thank you to shut your mouth 
as for you giving yourself airs
about motherhood   
a cat s a better mother
than you are 
have her things packed for me
in an hour  or i warn you   
i ve always thought a lashing with
a whip would benefit you immensely 
excuse me  mr  rhett 
  hello  uncle rhett 
  hello  beau 
daddy  where have you been 
i ve been waiting for you all morning 
i ve been hunting for a rabbit skin
to wrap my little bonnie in 
give your best sweetheart a kiss 
bonnie  i m going to take you
on a long trip to fairyland 
where  where 
i ll show you the tower of london 
where the little princes were   
and london bridge 
london bridge 
will it be falling down 
well  it will
if you want it to  darling 
daddy  dark 
dark 
bonnie  bonnie 
it s all right  bonnie 
who put out that light  nurse 
  daddy  dark 
  yes  yes  yes   
what s the matter with my bonnie 
a bear 
oh  a bear  a big bear 
dreadful big 
and he sat on my chest 
i ll stay here and shoot him
if he comes back 
oh  good evening  mr  butler 
i told you never to leave
this child alone in the dark 
children are often afraid of the dark 
but they get over it 
let her scream for a night   
let her scream 
either you re a fool
or an inhuman woman 
if you want her to grow up cowardly   
cowardly  there isn t
a cowardly bone in her body 
you re discharged 
as you say  sir 
where s mother 
bonnie   
aren t you happy here
in london with me 
i wanna go home 
miss bonnie  and captain butler 
miss scarlett 
hello  mammy 
honey child 
miss scarlett  they s back 
they s back 
bonnie  bonnie  baby 
darling baby 
you glad to be home 
daddy gave me a kitten 
but london s a horrid place 
where s my pony 
i wanna go out and see my pony 
you go out and see your pony 
where s my pony 
i want to go out and see my pony 
you run along with mammy 
come on  honey child 
mammy sure missed you  honey 
mrs  butler  i believe 
mammy said you d come back 
only to bring bonnie 
apparently any mother 
even a bad one  is better than none 
you mean you re going away again 
what perception  mrs  butler 
right away 
  in fact  i left my bags at the station 
  oh 
you re looking pale 
is there a shortage of rouge 
or can this wanness mean
you ve been missing me 
if i m pale  it s your fault 
not because i ve been
missing you  but because   
pray continue  mrs  butler 
it s because i m going to have a baby 
indeed  and who s the happy father 
you know it s yours 
i don t want it any more than you do 
no woman would want the child
of a cad like you 
i wish it were anybody s
child but yours 
well  cheer up 
maybe you ll have an accident 
is she better 
has she asked for me 
don t you understand 
she s delirious 
rhett   
i want rhett 
what s the matter  honey 
did you call somebody  child 
it s no use  it s no use 
dr  meade s left 
  scarlett s dead 
  oh  no  she s much better 
really she is 
there  there  captain butler 
you re beside yourself 
she ll very soon be well again 
i promise you 
she never wanted this baby 
not want a baby 
why  every woman wants a baby 
you do  but she doesn t 
not my children 
she told me she didn t want any more 
i wanted to hurt her because
she d hurt me  and i did 
you mustn t tell me these things 
it s not fair to   
i didn t know about this baby
until she fell 
if i d only known 
i d have come straight home 
well  of course you would 
and then when she told me
there on the steps  what did i do 
what did i say 
i laughed and i said   
but you didn t mean it 
i know you didn t mean it 
but i did mean it 
i was crazy with jealousy 
she s never cared for me  i tried
to make her care  but i couldn t 
you re so wrong 
scarlett loves you a great deal 
much more than she knows 
if that were true  i d wait forever 
if she d only forgive me 
she will  you must be patient 
no  it s not possible  if you
only knew who she really loved   
you wouldn t believe it 
surely you haven t
listened to idle gossip 
no  captain butler 
i wouldn t believe it 
there  there  scarlett s going to get well 
and there can be other babies 
she couldn t even if she wanted to 
but of course she could 
i m going to 
no  miss melly  you mustn t risk it 
it s too dangerous 
children are life renewing itself 
captain butler 
and when life does that 
danger seems very unimportant 
i ve never before known anyone
who was really brave 
i pray god things go well
with you  miss melly 
and i want to thank you for all
you ve done for me and for scarlett 
from my heart  i thank you 
miss scarlett s feeling
a heap better today  mr  rhett 
thank you  mammy 
i ve come to ask your forgiveness   
hoping our life together
has another chance 
our life together  when did we
ever have a life together 
yes  you re right 
but i m sure if we could only
try again  we could be happy 
what is there
to make us happy now 
well  there s bonnie   
and i love you  scarlett 
when did you discover that 
i ve always loved you  but you ve
never given me a chance to show it 
and just what do you want me to do 
to begin with  give up the mill 
scarlett  we ll go away 
we ll take bonnie
and have another honeymoon 
give up the mill 
it s making more money than ever 
i know  but we don t need it 
sell it 
or give it to ashley 
melanie s been such a friend to us 
melanie 
if you d only think more about me 
i am thinking of you 
and i m thinking that  well   
maybe the mill s taking you
away from me and bonnie 
i know what you re thinking 
don t bring bonnie into it 
  you re taking her away from me 
  but she loves you 
you ve made her love you and not me 
she s so spoiled now  that   
mommy  daddy  watch me 
we re watching  darling 
you re mighty pretty  precious 
so are you 
i m going to jump 
watch me  daddy 
i don t think you ought
to do much jumping yet 
you just learned
to ride sidesaddle 
i will so jump 
i can jump better than ever 
because i ve grown 
i moved the bar higher 
don t let her do it  rhett 
no  bonnie  you can t

these last couple of days 
oh  no  mammy  no 
i ain t never seen no man  black or white

when dr  meade say her neck broke   
mr  rhett grabbed his gun and run
out and shoot that poor pony 
and for a minute 
i think he gonna shoot hisself 
oh  poor captain butler 
miss scarlett called him a murderer
for teaching that child to jump 
she said   you give me my baby
what you killed  
and then he say miss scarlett ain t
never cared nothing about miss bonnie 
it like to turn my blood cold 
the things they say to one another 
stop  mammy  don t tell me any more 
and then that night   
mr  rhett  he locked hisself
in the nursery with miss bonnie 
he wouldn t open the door when
miss scarlett beat on it and hollered 
and that s where he s been
for two whole days 
oh  mammy 
this evening  miss scarlett shouted
through the door and said 
 the funeral s set for tomorrow  
he says   you try that 
and i kills you tomorrow

scarlett  what can i do 
i can t live without her  i can t 
everything i ever had
is going with her 
oh  ashley   
you really love her  don t you 
she s the only dream i ever had
that didn t die in the face of reality 
dreams  always dreams with you 
never common sense 
scarlett  if you knew what
i ve gone through 
ashley  you should ve told me years
ago that you loved her and not me 
and not left me dangling
with your talk of honor 
but you had to wait till now 
now when melly s dying   
to show me that i could never
mean any more to you   
than this watling woman
does to rhett 
and i ve loved something
that doesn t really exist 
but somehow   
i don t care 
somehow  it doesn t matter 
it doesn t matter one bit 
oh  ashley

don t cry  she mustn t see
you ve been crying

melanie  she s    
well  god rest her 
she was the only completely
kind person i ever knew 
a great lady  a very great lady 
so she s dead  that makes it
nice for you  doesn t it 
how can you say such a thing 
you know how i loved her  really 
no  i don t know that i do 
it s to your credit that
you could appreciate her 
of course i appreciated her 
she thought of everybody except herself 
  why  her last words were about you 
  what did she say 
she said   be kind to captain butler   
he loves you so  
  did she say anything else 
  she said   
she asked me to look after ashley too 
it s convenient to have
the first wife s permission  isn t it 
what do you mean 
what are you doing 
i m leaving you  my dear 
all you need now is a divorce 
and your dreams of ashley can come true 
oh  no 
no  you re wrong  terribly wrong 
i don t want a divorce 
oh  rhett  when i knew tonight 
when i knew i loved you   
i ran home to tell you 
oh  darling  darling 
please don t go on with this 
leave us some dignity out
of our marriage  spare us this last 
this last  do listen to me  i must
have loved you for years  only   
i was such a fool 
i didn t know it 
please believe me  you must care 
melly said you did 
i believe you 
and what about ashley wilkes 
i never really loved ashley 
you certainly gave a good imitation
of it  up to this morning 
no  scarlett  i ve tried everything 
if you d met me halfway  even
when i came back from london 
i was so glad to see you 
i was  rhett  but you were so nasty 
then when you were sick 
and it was all my fault 
i hoped that you d call for me 
but you didn t 
i wanted you  i wanted you
desperately   
but i didn t think you wanted me 
it seems we ve been
at cross purposes  doesn t it 
but it s no use now 
as long as there was bonnie 
there was a chance we might be happy 
i liked to think that bonnie
was you  a little girl again 
before the war and poverty
had done things to you 
she was so like you 
and i could pet her and spoil her 
as i wanted to spoil you 
but when she went  she took everything 
rhett  please don t say that 
i m so sorry 
i m so sorry for everything 
my darling  you re such a child 
you think that by saying   i m sorry  
all the past can be corrected 
here  take my handkerchief 
never  in any crisis of your life  have
i known you to have a handkerchief 
rhett  rhett  where are you going 
i m going to charleston 
back where i belong 
please  please take me with you 
no  i m through
with everything here 
i want peace 
i want to see if somewhere   
there isn t something left
in life of charm and grace 
  you know what i m talking about 
  no 
  i only know that i love you 
  that s your misfortune 
oh  rhett 
rhett 
rhett  rhett 
rhett  if you go  where shall i go 
what shall i do 
frankly  my dear 
i don t give a damn 
i can t let him go  i can t 
there must be some way
to bring him back 
oh  i can t think about this now 
i ll go crazy if i do 
i ll think about it tomorrow 
but i must think about it 
i must think about it 
what is there to do 
what is there that matters 
you mean to tell me 
scarlett  tara doesn t mean anything 
land s the only thing that matters 
it s the only thing that lasts 
something you love more than
me  though you may not know it  tara 
it s this from which you get
your strength  the red earth of tara 
land s the only thing that matters 
the only thing that lasts 
something you love more
than me  though you may not know it 
from which you get
your strength  tara 
land s the only thing that matters 
something you love more 
  the red earth of tara 
  tara 
  tara
