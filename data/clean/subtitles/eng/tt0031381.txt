i wore this old dress for you
i was counting on eating with you

i was awake all last night
trying to figure it out
oh shucks
cathleen whos that
who
that man looking at us and smiling
the nasty dark one
dont you know thats rhett butler
hes from charleston
he has a most terrible reputation
he looks as if he knows
what i look like without my shimmy
my dear he isnt received
he spends his time up north
because his folks wont speak to him
he was expelled
from west point hes so fast
and theres that business
about the girl he wouldnt marry
tell tell
he took her out buggyriding in
the late afternoon without a chaperon
and then he refused to marry her
no but she was ruined just the same
ashley  happy  so happy
you seem to belong here
as if it had all been
imagined for you
i like to feel that i belong
to the things you love
you love twelve oaks as i do
yes ashley
i love it as more than a house
its a whole world that wants only
to be graceful and beautiful
its so unaware
that it may not last forever
youre afraid of what may happen
if the war comes
but we dont have to be afraid for us
no war can come into our world ashley
whatever comes ill love you
just as i do now until i die
isnt this better than a table
a girl hasnt got but two sides
to her at a table
ill get her dessert
she said me
allow me miss ohara
i think hmm
i think charles hamilton may get it
thank you miss ohara
thank you
go get it boy
isnt he the luckiest
miss ohara
i love you
i dont guess im as hungry
as i thought
why do i have to take a nap
im not tired
wellbroughtup ladies
takes naps at parties
its time you behave and act
like you was miss ellens daughter
when we were in saratoga
i didnt see yankee girls taking naps
and you wont see no yankee
girls at the ball neither
how was ashley today
he didnt pay much attention to you
you mind your own business
youll be lucky you dont lose
whiskerface kennedy
youre sweet on ashley and his
engagements being announced tonight
thats as much as you know
you ought to behave yourself
acting like poor whitetrash children
if yous old enough for parties
you should act like ladies
who cares
weve borne enough insults
from the yankees
well keep our slaves
with or without their approval
twas the sovereign right of
georgia to secede from the union
the south must assert herself
by force of arms
after weve fired on the yankee rascals
at fort sumter weve got to fight
theres no other way
thats right
let the yankees ask for peace
the situations very simple
the yankees cant fight and we can
there wont be a battle
theyll turn and run
one of us can lick 20 yanks
well beat them in one battle
gentlemen can always fight
better than rabble
gentlemen always fight better
what does the captain
of our troop say
well gentlemen
if georgia fights i go with her
i hope the yankees let us
leave the union in peace
ashley theyve insulted us
you cant mean you dont want war
most of the miseries of the world
were caused by wars
and when the wars were over
no one ever knew what they were about
now gentlemen mr butlers
been up north i hear
dont you agree with us
i think its hard winning
a war with words
what do you mean sir
theres not a cannon factory
in the whole south
what difference does that make
to a gentleman
itll make a great difference
to a great many gentlemen sir
are you hinting
that the yankees can lick us
no im not hinting
im saying plainly the yankees
are better equipped than we
theyve got factories
shipyards coal mines
and a fleet to bottle up
our harbors and starve us
all weve got is cotton and slaves
and arrogance
i refuse to listen
to any renegade talk
im sorry if the truth offends you
apologies arent enough sir
i hear you were turned out
of west point mr rhett butler
and you arent received in
any family in charleston
not even your own
i apologize again
for all my shortcomings
perhaps you wont mind if
i look over your place
i seem to be spoiling everybodys
brandy and cigars
and dreams of victory
thats what you can expect
from somebody like rhett butler
you did everything but call him out
he refused to fight
not quite there charles
he refused to take advantage of you
take advantage of me
hes one of the best shots in the country
as hes proved many times
hes got steadier hands than yours
well ill show him
please dont go tweaking
his nose anymore
you may be needed for more
important fighting
if youll excuse me
mr butlers our guest
i think ill just show him around
ashley
ashley
scarlett
who are you hiding from in here
what are you up to
why arent you upstairs
resting with the other girls
what is this scarlett a secret
oh ashley
ashley
i love you
scarlett
i love you i do
isnt it enough that you gathered
every other mans heart today
youve always had mine
you cut your teeth on it
dont tease me now
have i your heart my darling
i love you i love you
you mustnt say such things
youll hate me for hearing them
i could never hate you
and i know you must care about me
you do care dont you
yes i care
cant we go away
and forget we ever said these things
but how can we do that
dont you
dont you want to marry me
im going to marry melanie
but you cant
not if you care for me
oh my dear why must you make me
say things that will hurt you
how can i make you understand
youre so young you dont
know what marriage means
i know i love you
and i want to be your wife
you dont love melanie
shes like me scarlett
shes my blood
and we understand each other
but you love me
how could i help loving you
you have all the passion
for life that i lack
that kind of love isnt enough
for two people as different as we are
why not say it you coward
youre afraid to marry me
youd marry that fool
who can only say
yes no and raise
a passel of mealymouthed brats
you mustnt say that
who are you to tell me i mustnt
you led me on
you made me believe youd marry me
scarlett be fair
i never at any time
you did its true you did
ill hate you till i die
i cant think of anything
bad enough to call you
has the war started
sir you should have made
your presence known
in the middle of that
beautiful love scene
that wouldnt have been tactful
would it
but dont worry
your secret is safe with me
sir you are no gentleman
and you miss are no lady
i dont hold that against you
ladies never held any charm for me
first you take advantage of me
then you insult me
i meant it as a compliment
i hope to see more of you when
youre free of the spell of mr wilkes
he doesnt strike me as good
enough for a girl of your
what was it
your passion for living
how dare you
you arent fit to wipe his boots
and you were going to hate him
for the rest of your life
she certainly made a fool
of herself running after all the men
thats not fair india
shes so attractive
men naturally flock to her
melanie youre just too good to be true
didnt you see her going after charles
and she knows charles belongs to me
youre wrong india
scarletts just highspirited
and vivacious
men flirt with girls like that
but they dont marry them
i think youre being very mean to her
miss ohara
miss ohara
mr lincolns called volunteers
to fight against us
dont you men think
about anything important
but its war everybodys going off
to enlist im going too
everybody
miss ohara will you be sorry
to see us go
ill cry into my pillow every night
miss ohara i told you i loved you
youre the most beautiful girl in the
world and the sweetest the dearest
i couldnt hope that you could love me
im so clumsy and stupid
and not nearly good enough for you
but if you could think of marrying me
id do anything in the world for you
just anything i promise
what did you say
miss ohara i said
would you marry me
yes mr hamilton i will
you will youll marry me
youll wait for me
i dont think id want to wait
youll marry me before i go
oh miss ohara scarlett
when may i speak to your father
the sooner the better
ill go now i cant wait
will you excuse me dear
dear
mr ohara mr ohara
itll be a week before they call me
a week till they take you away from me
oh ashley
i thought of you
at our wedding yesterday
and i hoped yours
would be as beautiful
and it was
was it
now were really and truly sisters
charles
melanie
dont cry darling
the war will be over in a few weeks
and ill be coming back to you
miss scarlett
i dont care
im too young to be a widow
miss scarlett
why id just go around
scaring people in that thing
you shouldnt be around people
yous in mourning
for what i dont feel anything
why should i have to
pretend and pretend
what is it
oh poor baby
what is it
my life is over
nothing will ever happen to me anymore
darling
oh mother
i know you think im horrible
but i just cant bear
going around in black
its bad enough not being able to
go to parties but looking this way too
i dont think youre at all horrible
its only natural you want to look young
and be young when you are young
oh baby
how would you like to visit somewhere
savannah perhaps
what would i do in savannah
well atlanta then
theres lots going on there
and you can stay with melanie
and her aunt pittypat
melanie
yes
yes i could couldnt i
oh mother youre sweeter
than anybody in the world
youd like it really
all right then
now stop your crying and smile
you can take prissy with you
start packing
miss scarletts things mammy
ill go write the necessary letters
atlanta
savannah would be better for you
youll get in trouble in atlanta
what are you talking about
you know what is talking about
im talking about mr ashley wilkes
hell come to atlanta for his leave
and you waiting for him just like a spider
he belongs to miss melanie
go pack my things like mother said
theyre all whispering
and i know its about her
whats it matter pittypat
scarletts living under my roof
so they think im responsible for her
and for a widow to appear in public
at a social gathering
every time i think of it i feel faint
you know scarlett came here
only to help raise money for the cause
it was splendid of her
to make the sacrifice
anyone hearing you talk would think
she came to dance instead of sell things
ladies and gentlemen
i have important news glorious news
another triumph
for our magnificent men in arms
general lee has completely
whipped the enemy
and swept the yankee army
northward from virginia
and now a happy surprise
for all of us
we have with us tonight that most
daring of all blockade runners
whose fleet schooners
slipping past the yankee guns
have brought us here the very
woolens and laces we wear tonight
i refer ladies and gentlemen to that
willothewisp of the bounding main
none other than our friend
from charleston
captain rhett butler
permit me
captain butler such a pleasure
to see you again
i met you last at my husbands home
thats kind of you to remember
mrs wilkes
did you meet captain butler
at twelve oaks scarlett
yes i i think so
only for a moment
it was in the library
you had broken something
yes captain butler i remember you
ladies the confederacy asks for your
jewelry on behalf of our noble cause
we arent wearing any
were in mourning
wait
on behalf of mrs wilkes
and mrs hamilton
thank you captain butler
just a moment please
but its your wedding ring maam
it may help my husband more
off my finger
thank you
that was a very beautiful thing to do
here
you can have mine too
for the cause
and you mrs hamilton
i know just how much that means to you
melanie
dr meade
i need your approval
for something we want to do
thats rather shocking
will you excuse us
ill say one thing the war makes
the most peculiar widows
i wish youd go away
if you had any raising youd know
id never want to see you again
now why be silly
youve no reason for hating me
ill carry your guilty secret
to my grave
id be very unpatriotic to hate
a great hero of the war
i declare i was surprised you
turned out to be a noble character
i cant bear to take advantage
of your littlegirl ideas
im neither noble nor heroic
but you are a blockade runner
for profit and profit only
you dont believe in the cause
rhett butler is the only cause i know
the rest doesnt mean much to me
and now ladies and gentlemen
i have a startling surprise
for the benefit of the hospital
gentlemen if you wish to lead the reel
with the lady of your choice
you must bid for her
caroline meade how can you let your
husband conduct this slave auction
darlene merriwether
how dare you criticize me
melanie told the doctor that if its
for the cause its quite all right
she did
oh dear oh dear
where are my smelling salts
i think i shall faint
dont you dare faint pittypat
if melanie says its all right
it is all right
come gentlemen
do i hear your bids make your offers
dont be bashful gentlemen
twenty dollars twenty dollars
for miss maybelle merriwether
twentyfive dollars
for miss fanny elsing
only 25 to give your
one hundred and fifty dollars in gold
for what lady sir
for mrs charles hamilton
for whom sir
mrs charles hamilton
mrs hamilton is in mourning
but im sure any of our atlanta belles
would be proud to
dr meade i said
mrs charles hamilton
she will not consider it sir
oh yes i will
my goodness gracious
ooh ooh
choose your partners
for the virginia reel
weve shocked the confederacy
its like blockade running isnt it
its worse i expect
a very fancy profit out of it
i dont care what you expect
im gonna dance and dance
tonight i wouldnt mind dancing
with abe lincoln himself
another dance and my reputation
will be lost forever
with enough courage
you can do without a reputation
oh you do talk scandalous
you do waltz divinely captain butler
dont start flirting with me
im not one of your plantation beaus
i want more than flirting from you
what do you want
ill tell you scarlett
ohara if youll take
that southern belle
simper off your face
someday i want you to say to me the
words i heard you say to ashley wilkes
i love you
thats something youll never hear
from me as long as you live

im not a marrying man
well i wont kiss you for it either
open your eyes and look at me

youre the proper person
i might be if the right moment
ever came
youre a conceited
blackhearted varmint
i dont know why
i let you come and see me

thinking of your own hide
never a thought for the cause
how could you do this to me
and why should you go now that
its all over and i need you
why why

ive always had a weakness
for lost causes once theyre really lost
or maybe
maybe im ashamed of myself

if they capture you
now climb down here
i want to say goodbye

in spite of you and me and the world
going to pieces i love you
because were alike
bad lots both of us
selfish and shrewd but able to look
things in the eye and call them by name
dont hold me like that
scarlett look at me
i love you more than
ive ever loved any woman
and ive waited longer
for you than any woman
let me alone
a soldier of the south loves you
wants your arms around him
wants to carry the memory
of your kisses into battle
never mind about loving me
youre a woman sending a soldier
to his death with a beautiful memory
scarlett kiss me
kiss me once
you lowdown cowardly
nasty thing you
they were right everybody was right
you arent a gentleman
a minor point at such a moment
here if anyone lays a hand
on that nag shoot him
but dont make a mistake
and shoot the nag
go on i want you to go
i hope a cannonball blows you
into a million pieces
never mind the rest
i follow your general idea
and when im dead on the altar of my
country i hope your conscience irks you

we gotta get him out of here
and bury him
if the yankees find him here
i didnt see anyone else
i think he must be a deserter
even so weve gotta hide him
they might hear about it
and then theyd come and get you
i could bury him in the arbor
where the ground is soft
but how will i get him
out of here
well both take a leg and drag him
you couldnt drag a cat
scarlett
would it be dishonest
if we went through his haversack
im ashamed i didnt think

if the war hadnt come id have spent
my life happily buried at twelve oaks
but the war did come
i saw my boyhood friends blown to bits
i saw men crumple up in agony
when i shot them
and now i find myself in a world
which for me is worse than death
a world in which theres
no place for me
i cant make you understand

you never mind facing realities
you never want to escape
from them as i do

who loses money so pleasantly
rhett
scarlett
my dear little sister
its all right corporal my sister
has brought me no files or saws
can i really kiss you
on the forehead like a good brother
no thanks ill wait and hope
for better things
i was so distressed when
i heard you were in jail
i couldnt sleep for thinking
its not true theyll hang you
would you be sorry
oh rhett
well dont worry yet
they trumped up a charge
but they really want my money
they think i made off
with the confederate treasury
well did you
what a leading question
lets not talk about things
like money
how good of you to come and see me
and how pretty you look
how you do run on
teasing a country girl like me
thank heavens youre not in rags
im tired of women in rags turn around
you look good enough to eat
and prosperous
ive been doing very well
everyones well at tara only
i got so bored i thought
id treat myself to a visit to town
youre heartless
but thats part of your charm
youve got more charm
than the law allows
i didnt come to talk
silliness about me
i was so miserable at the thought
of you in trouble
i was mad at you when
you left me on the road to tara
and i still havent forgiven you
dont say that
well i must admit i might not be
alive now only for you
when i think of myself
with anything i could possibly hope for
not a care in the world
and you here in this horrid jail
and not even a human jail
rhett a horse jail
listen to me trying to make jokes
when i really want to cry
in a minute i shall cry
scarlett
can it be possible that
can what be possible rhett
that youve grown a womans heart
a real womans heart
i have rhett i know i have
its worth being in jail
just to hear you say that
its well worth it
you can drop the moonlight
and magnolia
things have been going well at tara
whatve you done with your hands
i went riding without my gloves
youve been working like a field hand
why did you lie
and what are you up to
i almost believed you cared
but i do care
lets get down to the truth
you want something enough
to put on quite a
show in your velvets
what is it money
i want 300 to pay the taxes on tara
i lied when i said
everything was all right
things are as bad as they possibly
could be and youve got millions
what collateral do you have
my earbobs
not interested
mortgage on tara
what would i do with a farm
id pay you out of next years cotton
not good enough
you once said you loved me
if you still love me
you havent forgotten
im not a marrying man
no i havent forgotten
youre not worth 300
youll never mean anything
but misery to any man
i dont care what you say
only give me the money
i wont let tara go i cant while
theres a breath left in my body
oh rhett wont you please
give me the money
i couldnt if i wanted to
my funds are in liverpool
not atlanta
if i drew a draft theyd be on me
like a duck on a june bug
so you see my dear
youve abased yourself to no purpose
here here stop it you want
the yankees to see you like this
take your hands off me you skunk
you knew what i wanted
you knew you wouldnt lend me
the money and you let me go on
i enjoyed hearing
what you had to say cheer up

ill put you in my will
ill come to your hanging
im just afraid they wont hang you
in time to pay the taxes on tara
tell him belle watling
where you been i thought

i keep myself occupied
help me out
who that i aint never seed hair
that color before in my life
you know a dyedhaired woman
wish i knew that one

its good to see home folks
i didnt know you were here
i didnt know you were
didnt suellen tell you
about my store
did she i dont remember
have you a store
this
wont you come in look around a bit
i dont suppose
it looks like much to a lady
but i cant help being proud of it
youre not making money
well i cant complain
in fact im mighty encouraged
folks tell me
im just a born merchant
wont be long before
miss suellen and i can marry
are you doing as well as all that
yes i am
im no millionaire yet
but ive cleared 1000 already
and lumber too
thats only a sideline
a sideline frank
with all the good georgia pine
around atlanta and all this building
well all that takes money
miss scarlett
and i gotta think
about buying a home
why would you want a home
for suellen to set up housekeeping
here in atlanta
youd want to bring her to atlanta
there wouldnt be much help
in that for tara
i dont know what you mean
i dont mean a thing
howd you like to drive me
to my aunt pittys
nothingd give me more pleasure
you better stay to supper
aunt pittyd be agreeable
and id like a long visit
you act on me just like a tonic
miss scarlett
and will you tell me all the news
of miss suellen
whats the matter
miss suellens not ill is she
oh no no i thought
surely she had written you
i guess she was ashamed to write you
she should be ashamed
how awful to have such a mean sister
you must tell me
dont leave me on tenterhooks
well shes going to marry
one of the county boys next month
she got tired of waiting
was afraid shed be an old maid and
oh im sorry to be
the one to tell you
its cold and i left my muff at home
would you mind if i put my hand
in your pocket
but melanie you dont realize
what shes done
shes gone and married
my mr kennedy
hes my beau and shes married him
she did it to save tara
i hate tara
i hate scarlett shes
the only thing i hate worse than tara
its all my fault
i shouldve committed robbery
to get that tax money for you
i couldnt let you do
anything like that
anyway its done now
yes its done now
you wont let me do
anything dishonorable
yet youd sell yourself in marriage
to a man you didnt love
you wont have to worry
about my helplessness anymore
what do you mean
im going to new york
ive arranged
for a position in a bank
but you cant do that
i counted on you to help me start
a lumber business and
i counted on you
i dont know anything
about the lumber business
you know as much as you do
about banking
and id give you half the business
thats generous of you scarlett
but it isnt that
if i go to atlanta
and take help from you again
id bury any hope
of ever standing alone
oh is that all
you could gradually buy the business
and then it would be your own and
no scarlett
oh ashley
ashley
scarlett
scarlett what is it
ashleys so mean and hateful
what have you done
she wanted me to go to atlanta
to help me start my lumber business
and he wont help me
how unchivalrous of you
why think ashley think
if it hadnt been for scarlett
id have died in atlanta
and maybe we wouldnt have
little beau
when i think of her picking cotton
and plowing
just to keep food in our mouths
i could just
oh my darling
all right melanie
ill go to atlanta
i cant fight you both
come on lift them feet
theres your new mill hands
mrs kennedy
the pick of all the best jails
in georgia
they look thin and weak
halt
theyre the best you can lease
if youll give johnnie gallegher
a free hand
youll get what you want
out of them
all right youre the foreman
just keep the mill running
and deliver my lumber when i want it
johnnie galleghers
your man miss but remember
no questions and no interference
thats a bargain
start in the morning
come on get a move on there
but this isnt right and you know it
bad enough to be a businesswoman
why do you complain
you wouldnt own a mill
if i didnt take over
but i didnt want the mill
we couldnt buy it if you hadnt
pressed our friends for their debts
isnt that right ashley
are you running
a charitable institution
go back to the store and go home
and take your medicine
sugar dont you think
great balls of fire dont bother me
and dont call me sugar
all right all right
good night ashley
my my
she can get mad quicker
than any woman i ever saw
i dont like to interfere
but i wish youd let me hire
darkies and not use convicts
we could do better
darkies pay would break us
convicts are cheap
if we give gallegher a free hand
a free hand that means
hell starve and whip them
didnt you see them
some are sick
how you do run on
if i let you alone
youd give them chicken
and tuck them in with quilts
i wont make money out of the
enforced labor and misery of others
you didnt mind owning slaves
that was different
we didnt treat them that way
id have freed them
when father died
if the war hadnt
already freed them
oh im sorry ashley
do you forget what its like
without money
money is the most
important thing in the world
i dont intend to be without it again
ill make enough the only way i know
how so the yankees cant take tara
were not the only southerners
whove suffered
look at all our friends theyre
keeping their honor and kindness
and theyre starving ive no use
for fools who wont help themselves
i know what they say about me
i dont care
ill befriend carpetbaggers
and beat them at their own game
and youll beat them with me
thats it pull it
a little over to that side
afternoon mrs kennedy
good afternoon
business is certainly growing
it certainly is
youre doing business
with the people
who robbed us tortured us
and left us to starve
all thats past
i intend to make the best of things
even if they are yankee things
and do you know that dr meade
actually saw her
peddling lumber to yankees herself
that isnt all
its shocking what shes doing
to my brother
shes even taken to driving
her own buggy
my dear mrs kennedy
my very dear mrs kennedy
i dont see how you have
the gall to face me
you couldve had my millions
if youd just waited a while
oh how fickle is woman
what is it you want
i have things to do
will you satisfy my curiosity on a point
which has always bothered me
well what is it
tell me do you never shrink
from marrying men you dont love
howd you get out of jail
why didnt they hang you
oh that theres nothing much
that money wont buy
i observe its even bought you
the honorable mr wilkes
so you still hate ashley wilkes
i believe youre jealous of him
you still think youre the belle of the
county the cutest trick in shoe leather
that every man is in love with you
let me by
dont be angry
tell me where are you going
im going out to the mill
through shantytown alone
its dangerous to drive alone
through all that riffraff
dont worry about me
i can shoot straight
if i dont have to shoot too far
what a woman
give me a quarter
let go of my horse
hold this horse
let go
give me that gun
help help
help
help

its time you rebels learned you cant
take the law into your own hands
what are you laughing at
this isnt your night to teach
that lesson
these two have been
with me tonight yes sir
with you rhett
where
i dont like to say
in the presence of ladies
youd better say
come out on the porch
and ill tell you

to know where my husbands been

we dropped in on a friend of mine
and the captains
a mrs belle watling
we played cards
and drank champagne and well
now youve done it did you have
to show me up in front of my wife
now i hope youre satisfied
these ladies wont be speaking
with their husbands

mammy i want hot water
and lint for bandages
what can i use for a probe
if i only had my bag
were you really there
what did it look like
does she have cutglass chandeliers
plush curtains and dozens of mirrors
good heavens mrs meade
remember yourself
captain butler tell me what happened
all that happened
i was too late
when i got to the sullivan place
there had already been a skirmish
i found mr wilkes wounded
and dr meade was with him
i had to prove theyd been somewhere
anyplace but where they were
so i took them to belles
and she took them in
shes by way of being
an old friend of mine
oh im sorry
im sorry i couldnt think up
a more dignified alibi
this isnt the first time youve come
between me and disaster
it isnt likely that id question
any device of yours
and now ill go and see
what dr meade needs
oh ashley
ashley
have you no interest in whats
become of your own husband
did frank go with you
to belle watlings
no
well where is he
hes lying out on decatur road
shot through the head
hes dead
who is it
its mrs watling
oh mrs watling
wont you come in the house
oh no i couldnt do that
mrs wilkes
you come in and sit a minute with me
how can i thank you enough
for what you did for us
i got your note saying you would
call on me and thank me
why mrs wilkes
you must have lost your mind
i came as soon as it was dark to say
you mustnt think of any such thing
why im
well youre
it wouldnt be fitting at all
it wouldnt be fitting for me to thank
a woman who saved my husbands life
mrs wilkes there aint never been
a lady nice to me like you was
i mean about the money
for the hospital
i dont forget a kindness
i thought about you being widowed
with a little boy
if mr wilkes got hung
hes a nice little boy
your boy is mrs wilkes
i got a boy myself so i
you have does he live
oh no he aint here in atlanta
he aint never been here
hes off at school
i aint seen him since he was little
anyways if it had been that
mrs kennedys husband by hisself
i wouldnt have lifted a finger
no matter what rhett said
shes a mighty cold woman
prancing about atlanta by herself
she killed her husband
same as if she shot him
you mustnt say unkind things
about my sisterinlaw
oh
please dont freeze me mrs wilkes
i forgot how you liked her
she just aint in the same class with you
and i cant help it if i think so
well anyways i gotta be going
im scared somebodyll recognize
this carriage if i stay any longer
that wouldnt do you no good
and mrs wilkes if you ever see me
on the street
you dont have to speak to me
ill understand
i should be proud to speak to you
proud to be under obligation to you
i hope we meet again
oh no that wouldnt be fitting
good night mrs wilkes
good night mrs watling
and youre wrong about mrs kennedy
shes brokenhearted about her husband
whoa
great balls of fire
its rhett
captain butlers here
i told him you was prostrate with grief
tell him ill be right down mammy
she says shes coming
i dont know why shes coming
but shes coming
you dont like me mammy
dont you argue with me
you dont you really dont
its no good scarlett
what
the cologne
i dont know what you mean
i mean youve been drinking
brandy quite a lot
well what if i have
is that any of your affair
dont drink alone
people always find out
and it ruins a reputation
what is it
this is more than losing old frank
oh rhett im so afraid
i dont believe it
youve never been afraid
im afraid now
im afraid of dying and going to hell
you look pretty healthy
and maybe there isnt any hell
oh there is i know there is
i was raised on it
far be it from me to question
the teachings of childhood
tell me what youve done
that hell yawns before you
i ought never to have married frank
he was suellens beau
and he loved her not me
and i made him miserable
and i killed him
yes i did i killed him
rhett for the first time
im finding out what it is
to be sorry for something ive done
here dry your eyes
if you had it all to do over again
youd do no differently
youre like the thief
who isnt sorry he stole
but hes terribly sorry
hes going to jail
im glad mothers dead
im glad shes dead
so she cant see me
i always wanted to be like her
calm and kind
and sadly ive turned out
disappointing
you know scarlett i think
youre on the verge of a crying jag
so ill change the subject
and say what i came to say
say it then and get out
what is it
i cant go on any longer without you
oh you really are the most illbred man
to come here at a time
i made up my mind you were
the only woman for me
the first day i saw you
now you have a mill
and franks money
and wont come to me
as you did to the jail
so i see i shall have to marry you
i never heard of such bad taste
would you be convinced
if i fell to my knees
turn me loose and get out
forgive me for startling you
with my impetuous sentiments
my dear scarlett
i mean my dear mrs kennedy
but you must have noticed
that for some time
the friendship ive felt for you
has ripened into a deeper feeling
a feeling more beautiful
more pure more sacred
dare i name it can it be love
get up off your knees
i dont like your common jokes
this is an honorable proposal
of marriage
made at what i consider
a most opportune moment
i cant go all my life waiting
to catch you between husbands
youre coarse and youre conceited
and i think this conversations
gone far enough
besides i shall never marry again
oh yes you will
and youll marry me
you you
i dont love you
and i dont like being married
ever think of marrying
just for fun
marriage fun
fiddledeedee
fun for men you mean
do you want them to hear you
youve been married
to a boy and an old man
why not try a husband of the right age
with a way with women
youre a fool rhett butler
when you know i shall always love
another man
stop it you hear me stop it
no more of that talk
dont i shall faint
i want you to faint
this is what youre meant for
none of those fools
have kissed you like this
your charles or your frank
or your stupid ashley
say youre going to marry me
say yes say yes
yes
are you sure you meant it
you dont want to take it back
no
look at me
and try to tell me the truth
did you say yes because of my money
well yes partly
partly
well you know rhett
money does help
and of course i am fond of you
fond of me
if i said i was madly in love
with you youd know i was lying
you say we have a lot in common
yes youre right my dear
im not in love
any more than you are
heaven help the man
who ever really loves you
what kind of ring would you like
a diamond ring
and do buy a great big one
youll have the biggest
and most vulgar ring in atlanta
ill take you to new orleans
for the most expensive honeymoon
thatd be heavenly
ill buy your trousseau for you too
how wonderful
but you wont tell anybody
will you
still the little hypocrite
wont you kiss me goodbye
youve had enough kissing
for one afternoon
youre impossible you can go
i dont care if you never come back
but i will come back
what are you thinking about scarlett
im thinking about how rich we are
i can keep the lumber business too
yes of course you can
if it amuses you
now that youre so rich you can tell
everybody to go to the devil
but you were the main one
i wanted to go to the devil
dont scrape the plate
im sure theres more in the kitchen
oh rhett can i have
a chocolate one stuffed with meringue
if you dont stop being a glutton
youll get as fat as mammy
and ill divorce you
itd be nice if you bought
something for mammy
why should i buy her a present
when she called us both mules
mules why mules
she said we could give ourselves air
and get slicked up like racehorses
but we were just mules in horse
harness and we didnt fool anybody
i never heard anything more true
mammys a smart old soul
and one of the few people i know
whose respect id like to have
i wont give her a thing
then ill take her a petticoat
my mammy said
when she went to heaven
she wanted a red taffeta petticoat
so stiff that itd stand by itself
and so rustley the lord would say
its made of angels wings
she wont take it from you
shed rather die than wear it
that may be but im making
the gesture just the same
wake up wake up
you were having another nightmare
oh rhett
rhett i was so cold
and hungry and so tired
i couldnt find it i ran through
the mist and i couldnt find it
find what honey
i dont know
i always dream the same dream
and i never know
it seems to be hidden in the mist
darling
oh rhett do you think ill ever dream
that i found it and that im safe
dreams dont work that way
but when you get used
to being safe and warm
youll stop dreaming that dream
and scarlett im going to see
that you are safe
rhett would you do something for me
if i asked you
you know i would
will you take me away from here
dont you like new orleans
i love new orleans
but i want to go home
and visit tara
will you take me to tara
yes scarlett of course i will
well go tomorrow
you get your strength
from this red earth of tara
youre part of it
and its part of you
id give anything to have tara
the way it was before the war
would you
go ahead and make it that way
spend whatever you want
make it as fine a plantation
as it ever was
oh rhett
rhett you are good to me
can we still have our big new house
in atlanta
yes and it can be
as ornate as you want
marble terraces
stainedglass windows
wont everyone be jealous
i want everybody whos been mean
to me to be peagreen with envy
i dont care scarletts hateful
building that new house
just to show off
and even taking our servants
oh darling you mustnt think
unkindly of her
shes made it possible for us
to keep tara always
yes and what good is tara
shes had three husbands
and ill be an old maid
great jehoshaphat
great jehoshaphat

bonnie blue butler

twenty inches
ive grown as big as aunt pitty
you simply gotta make it 1812 again
you done had a baby
and you aint never gonna be
no 1812 inches again
there aint nothing to do about it
there is something to do about it
im just not going to get old and fat
before my time
i just wont have any more babies
i heard mr rhett say
that hed be wanting a son next year
tell captain butler i decided
not to go out
ill have supper in my room
i got your message
ill have them bring
my supper up here too
no objections to that i hope
no
yes uh
i mean i dont care
where you have your supper
rhett
yes
you see well ive decided
well i hope i dont have
any more children
my pet as i told you
before bonnie was born
its immaterial to me
whether you have one child or 20
no but you know what i
do you know what i mean
i do and do you know
i can divorce you for this
youre low enough to think of that
if you had any chivalry in you
or were nice
look at ashley wilkes melanie cant
have any more children and he
youve been to the lumber office
this afternoon
what has that got to do with it
quite the little gentleman ashley
pray go on mrs butler
its no use you wouldnt understand
you know im sorry for you scarlett
sorry for me
yes sorry for you because you throw
away happiness with both hands
and reach out for something
thatll never make you happy
i dont know
what youre talking about
if you were free and melly were dead
and you had your precious ashley
do you think youd be happy
youd never know him
never even understand his mind
any more than you understand
anything except money
never mind about that i want
you may keep your sanctity
itll work no hardship on me
you dont care
the world is full
of many things and people
and i shant be lonely
i will find comfort elsewhere
well thats fine
but i warn you in case you change
your mind i intend to lock my door
why bother
if i wanted to come in
no lock could keep me out
i knew most women were cheats
hypocritical and hard
but this one
it aint no use
what do you mean
i mean youre poisoned with her
i dont care what shes done to you
youre still in love with her
it pleasures me none to say it
maybe so but im through with her
youve gotta think of the child
childs worth 10 of the mother
youre a shrewd woman belle
and a very nice one
yes rhett
i was just thinking of the difference
between you and
youre both hardheaded businesswomen
and successful
but youve got a heart belle
and youre honest
goodbye rhett
goodbye belle
shell be a wonderful horsewoman
look at those hands and that seat
oh fiddledeedee
why we have to wheel a baby
when we have servants
good morning mrs merriwether

services at the battle of franklin
no and did i tell you

a stupendous contribution to the
association for the beautification
of the graves of the glorious dead

when im wearing a new bonnet
all the figures i ever knew
go right out of my head
figures are well lost when
the bonnets as pretty as that
scarlett you know
you get prettier all the time
you havent changed a bit since
our last barbecue at twelve oaks
where you sat under a tree
surrounded by dozens of beaus
that girl doesnt exist anymore
nothings turned out as i expected
ashley nothing
yes weve traveled a long road
since the old days havent we
oh the lazy days
the warm still
country twilight
the high soft negro laughter
from the quarters
the golden warmth and security
of those days
dont look back ashley
dont look back
it drags at your heart till
you cant do anything
but look back
i didnt mean to make you sad
my dear
i never want you to be anything
but completely happy
oh ashley
who is it
only your husband
come in
am i actually being invited
into the sanctuary
youre not ready for melanies party
ive got a headache rhett
you go without me
and make my excuses to melanie
what a whitelivered
little coward you are
get up youre going to that party
and youll have to hurry
has india dared
yes india has
everyone in town knows the story
kill them for spreading lies
i dont kill people who tell the truth
no time to argue
i wont go i cant go until
this misunderstanding clears up
you wont cheat melly out of publicly
ordering you out of her house
there was nothing wrong
india hates me so i cant go
if you dont show your face tonight
youll never be able to again
i dont care but you wont ruin
bonnies chances
youre going to that party
for her sake get dressed
wear that nothing modest
or matronly will do for this occasion
and put on plenty of rouge
i want you to look your part tonight
for hes a jolly good fellow
for hes a jolly good fellow
for hes a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny
good night scarlett
but rhett
youre going into the arena alone
the lions are hungry
dont leave me dont
youre not afraid
what a lovely dress darling
india wasnt able to come
will you be an angel
i do need you to help me
receive my guests
mrs meade
heres our darling scarlett
good evening
good evening
why scarlett
good evening
ashley arent you going to get
our scarlett a glass of punch
did you have a good time
at miss mellys party
yes now mammy
be sure and leave word
if captain butler asks for me
when he comes back im asleep
yesm
come in mrs butler
come here
sit down
no reason you shouldnt
have a nightcap even if i am here
i didnt want a drink
i heard a noise
you heard nothing of the kind
you wouldnt have come
if you thought i was here
you must need a drink badly
i do not
take it dont give yourself airs
i know you drink on the quiet
and i know how much you drink
do you think i care
if you like your brandy
youre drunk and im going to bed
im very drunk
and i intend getting still drunker
before the evenings over
but youre not going to bed
not yet
sit down
so she stood by you did she
hows it feel to have the woman
youve wronged cloak your sins
youre wondering if she knows
all about you and ashley
youre wondering if she did it
just to save face
youre thinking shes a fool for doing it
even if it saved your hide
i will not listen
yes youll listen
miss mellys a fool
but not the kind you think
she has too much honor to conceive
of dishonor in anyone she loves
and she loves you
though just why she does
im sure i dont know
if you werent so drunk and insulting
i could explain everything
as it is though
you get out of that chair once more
of course the comic figure in all this
is the longsuffering mr wilkes
mr wilkes who cant be
mentally faithful to his wife
and wont be unfaithful to her
technically
why doesnt he make up his mind
rhett you
observe my hands my dear
i could tear you to pieces with them
and id do it if itd take
ashley out of your mind forever
but it wouldnt
so ill remove him
from your mind forever this way
ill put my hands so
one on each side of your head
and ill smash your skull
between them like a walnut
and thatll block him out
take your hands off me
you drunken fool
you know ive always admired
your spirit my dear
never more than now
when youre cornered
im not cornered
youll never corner me or frighten me
youve lived in dirt so long
you cant understand anything else
youre jealous of something
you cant understand
good night
jealous am i
yes i suppose i am
even though i know youve been
faithful to me all along
how do i know
because i know ashley wilkes
and his honorable breed
theyre gentlemen
thats more than i can say
for you or for me
were not gentlemen
and we have no honor have we
its not that easy scarlett
you turn me out while you chase ashley
while you dream of ashley
this is one night
youre not turning me out
how are you feeling this morning
well this misery in my back
aint so good
you act mighty happy this morning
i am mammy i am
oh she wept with delight
when he gave her a smile
and trembled with fear at his frown
hello
i um
id like to extend my apology
for my conduct of last night
oh but rhett
i was very drunk
and quite swept off my feet
by your charms
you neednt bother to apologize
nothing you do surprises me
ive been thinking and i believe
it would be better for both of us
if we admitted we made a mistake
and got a divorce
a divorce
yes
theres no point in holding on
to each other
ill provide for you
youve plenty of grounds
just give me bonnie
and you can say what you please
thank you but i wouldnt dream of
disgracing the family with a divorce
youd disgrace it
if ashley were free
makes my head spin to think
how quickly youd divorce me
wouldnt you
answer me wouldnt you
please go now and leave me alone
im going thats what i came
to tell you
im going on a very extended trip
to london
and im leaving today
oh
im taking bonnie with me
please get her duds packed right away
youll never take my child
out of this house
shes my child too youre mistaken
if you think im leaving her here
with a mother who doesnt
consider her reputation
youre a fine one to talk
you think ill let her out when youll
have her around people like belle
if you were a man
id break your neck for that
ill thank you to shut your mouth
as for you giving yourself airs
about motherhood
a cats a better mother
than you are
have her things packed for me
in an hour or i warn you
ive always thought a lashing with
a whip would benefit you immensely
excuse me mr rhett
hello uncle rhett
hello beau
daddy where have you been
ive been waiting for you all morning
ive been hunting for a rabbit skin
to wrap my little bonnie in
give your best sweetheart a kiss
bonnie im going to take you
on a long trip to fairyland
where where
ill show you the tower of london
where the little princes were
and london bridge
london bridge
will it be falling down
well it will
if you want it to darling
daddy dark
dark
bonnie bonnie

who put out that light nurse
daddy dark
yes yes yes
whats the matter with my bonnie
a bear
oh a bear a big bear
dreadful big
and he sat on my chest
ill stay here and shoot him
if he comes back
oh good evening mr butler
i told you never to leave
this child alone in the dark
children are often afraid of the dark
but they get over it
let her scream for a night
let her scream
either youre a fool
or an inhuman woman
if you want her to grow up cowardly
cowardly there isnt
a cowardly bone in her body
youre discharged
as you say sir
wheres mother
bonnie
arent you happy here
in london with me
i wanna go home
miss bonnie and captain butler
miss scarlett
hello mammy
honey child

you go out and see your pony
wheres my pony
i want to go out and see my pony
you run along with mammy
come on honey child
mammy sure missed you honey
mrs butler i believe
mammy said youd come back
only to bring bonnie
apparently any mother
even a bad one is better than none
you mean youre going away again
what perception mrs butler
right away
in fact i left my bags at the station
oh
youre looking pale
is there a shortage of rouge
or can this wanness mean
youve been missing me
if im pale its your fault
not because ive been
missing you but because
pray continue mrs butler
its because im going to have a baby
indeed and whos the happy father
you know its yours
i dont want it any more than you do
no woman would want the child
of a cad like you
i wish it were anybodys
child but yours
well cheer up
maybe youll have an accident
is she better
has she asked for me
dont you understand
shes delirious
rhett
i want rhett
whats the matter honey
did you call somebody child
its no use its no use
dr meades left
scarletts dead
oh no shes much better
really she is
there there captain butler
youre beside yourself
shell very soon be well again
i promise you
she never wanted this baby
not want a baby
why every woman wants a baby
you do but she doesnt
not my children
she told me she didnt want any more
i wanted to hurt her because
shed hurt me and i did
you mustnt tell me these things
its not fair to
i didnt know about this baby
until she fell
if id only known
id have come straight home
well of course you would
and then when she told me
there on the steps what did i do
what did i say
i laughed and i said
but you didnt mean it
i know you didnt mean it
but i did mean it
i was crazy with jealousy
shes never cared for me i tried
to make her care but i couldnt
youre so wrong
scarlett loves you a great deal
much more than she knows
if that were true id wait forever
if shed only forgive me
she will you must be patient
no its not possible if you
only knew who she really loved
you wouldnt believe it
surely you havent
listened to idle gossip
no captain butler
i wouldnt believe it
there there scarletts going to get well
and there can be other babies
she couldnt even if she wanted to
but of course she could
im going to
no miss melly you mustnt risk it
its too dangerous
children are life renewing itself
captain butler
and when life does that
danger seems very unimportant
ive never before known anyone
who was really brave
i pray god things go well
with you miss melly
and i want to thank you for all
youve done for me and for scarlett
from my heart i thank you
miss scarletts feeling
a heap better today mr rhett
thank you mammy
ive come to ask your forgiveness
hoping our life together
has another chance
our life together when did we
ever have a life together

try again we could be happy
what is there
to make us happy now
well theres bonnie

never given me a chance to show it
and just what do you want me to do

shes the only dream i ever had
that didnt die in the face of reality
dreams always dreams with you
never common sense
scarlett if you knew what
ive gone through
ashley you shouldve told me years
ago that you loved her and not me
and not left me dangling
with your talk of honor
but you had to wait till now
now when mellys dying
to show me that i could never
mean any more to you
than this watling woman
does to rhett
and ive loved something
that doesnt really exist

nice for you doesnt it
how can you say such a thing
you know how i loved her really
no i dont know that i do
its to your credit that
you could appreciate her
of course i appreciated her
she thought of everybody except herself
why her last words were about you
what did she say
she said be kind to captain butler
he loves you so
did she say anything else
she said
she asked me to look after ashley too
its convenient to have
the first wifes permission isnt it
what do you mean
what are you doing
im leaving you my dear
all you need now is a divorce
and your dreams of ashley can come true
oh no
no youre wrong terribly wrong
i dont want a divorce
oh rhett when i knew tonight
when i knew i loved you
i ran home to tell you
oh darling darling
please dont go on with this
leave us some dignity out
of our marriage spare us this last
this last do listen to me i must
have loved you for years only
i was such a fool
i didnt know it
please believe me you must care
melly said you did
i believe you
and what about ashley wilkes
i never really loved ashley
you certainly gave a good imitation
of it up to this morning
no scarlett ive tried everything
if youd met me halfway even
when i came back from london
i was so glad to see you
i was rhett but you were so nasty
then when you were sick
and it was all my fault
i hoped that youd call for me
but you didnt
i wanted you i wanted you
desperately
but i didnt think you wanted me
it seems weve been
at cross purposes doesnt it
but its no use now
as long as there was bonnie
there was a chance we might be happy
i liked to think that bonnie
was you a little girl again
before the war and poverty
had done things to you
she was so like you
and i could pet her and spoil her
as i wanted to spoil you
but when she went she took everything
rhett please dont say that
im so sorry
im so sorry for everything
my darling youre such a child
you think that by saying im sorry
all the past can be corrected
here take my handkerchief
never in any crisis of your life have
i known you to have a handkerchief
rhett rhett where are you going
im going to charleston
back where i belong
please please take me with you
no im through
with everything here
i want peace
i want to see if somewhere
there isnt something left
in life of charm and grace
you know what im talking about
no
i only know that i love you
thats your misfortune
oh rhett
rhett
rhett rhett
rhett if you go where shall i go
what shall i do
frankly my dear
i dont give a damn
i cant let him go i cant
there must be some way
to bring him back
oh i cant think about this now
ill go crazy if i do
ill think about it tomorrow
but i must think about it
i must think about it
what is there to do
what is there that matters
you mean to tell me
scarlett tara doesnt mean anything
lands the only thing that matters
its the only thing that lasts
something you love more than
me though you may not know it tara
its this from which you get
your strength the red earth of tara
lands the only thing that matters
the only thing that lasts
something you love more
than me though you may not know it
from which you get
your strength tara
lands the only thing that matters
something you love more
the red earth of tara
tara
