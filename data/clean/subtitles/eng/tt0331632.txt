is a rousing look back   
    at the exploits of mystery incorporated 
and here they are 
folks  this crowd is going crazy
over mystery inc 
here you go  girls 
i got an ascot for each of you 
hello 
check it out  it s a shag and scoob quake
and the whole city s shaking 
yeah

daphne  daphne  daphne 
hi  we love you  we have you tattooed
on our chests  look 
that s very sweet 
velma  velma 
  sign it  please 
  we love you  velma 
thanks 
  i love her so much 
  may i have a word   
   with coolsville s hottest detectives 
  absolutely 
that s your word 
come on  dear  we re late 
heather jasper howe
at the grand opening   
   of the new coolsonian
criminology museum   
   with our guests of honor  the master
detectives of mystery incorporated 
shaggy 
right on 
hello  hello 
with all your success  will you still
have time for us in little old coolsville 
of course little old coolsville
can solve its problems without us   
   but we ll always be here to help 
the people of coolsville
are the best in the world 
  can you tell us a little about the exhibit 
  absolutely 
mystery inc  is proud to donate the
costumes of criminals we ve unmasked 
  like the black knight ghost 
  our very first case 
the 10 000 volt ghost 
the skeleton men 
and even the dreaded pterodactyl ghost 
we ve also donated the costumes
of some of our more ridiculous foes 
like chickenstein 
can we get a shot of you
next to the black night 
ridiculous  obviously she forgot
that dude tried to pluck us 
  remember what i told you 
  never pick your nose in public 
no  but that s good too 
  image is everything 
  yes  lmage is everything 
the whole city s watching 
so try and keep a brave face 
  they re costumes 
  right 
she s right  scoob 
up close  they look totally fake 
the tar monster scared the locals
of byzantius away to take their treasure 
but on the positive side 
he d pave your driveway for free 
isn t that right  velma 
velma 
  hi 
  hi 
daphne  this is patrick wisely 
he s the curator here at the museum 
it s very nice to meet you  patrick 
i hope you ll be working closely with
velma on this ever expanding exhibit 
i know that you re a glamorous 
mysterious  jet set adventurer   
   preoccupied with
international intrigue and all   
  yes  that s me 
  i know  but   
there s a symposium coming up on
syntactic reasoning in the criminal brain   
i have always found
a criminal s inclination   
   to incorrectly use the interrogative
pronoun in place of the relative   
   delightfully absurd 
  me too 
  really 
so maybe you d want to go together 
suppose you mean like   
like a   
like a date  with me 
no  i can t  patrick 
mystery is my mistress 
i must heed her sweet call 
okay 
what s happening 
oh  boy 
daphne 
go  ned  get it  get it 
  we need to come up with a plan 
  hiding is our plan 
in case you haven t noticed  there s
an unidentified freaky object in here 
  the curtains 
  we re on them 
  come on  you chickens  grab those ropes 
  but chickens aren t good with ropes 
  we got him 
  shaggy  use the ropes to tie him up 
it s just a costume 
it s just a costume 
it s just a costume 
we tied it  let go 
sorry 
  we have to save shaggy and scooby 
  as usual 
fire 
mystery incorporated 
this is only the first rung
on the ladder of your demise 
look out 
and this time 
you ll be the ones unmasked   
   as the buffoons you truly are 
any clues to the cause of the attack  how
did the dinosaur get through security 
where did mystery inc  s plan go wrong 
a secret hatch 
the real pterodactyl ghost
must have come through here 
a reptilian scale 
a most wonderful clue 
he stole two costumes  the black knight
ghost and the 10 000 volt ghost  why 
fred  daphne  could you answer
a few questions for the press 
fred  i don t think
that s a really good idea 
we always face the press
after we ve unmasked the creeps 
we looked ridiculous back there 
don t worry about it  sweetheart 
the press loves us 
the higher the pedestal 
the harder the fall 
and mystery inc  fell far
in the embarrassing debacle   
    that tarnished the reputation
of the once great gang 
it was an utter disaster
as two of the gang s key members   
    norville  shaggy  rogers
and scoobert  scooby doo    
    caused untold damage to coolsville s
hottest new tourist attraction   
    which took a full two years to complete 
when asked for comment  fred jones 
leader of mystery inc   said this 
coolsville can solve its
problems without us 
i didn t say that  i mean   
i did  but that s out of context 
this is heather jasper howe 
disillusioned from coolsville 
it s all my fault 
i m the one who told shaggy
and scooby to get the ropes 
no  velma  it s my fault 
i should have checked
that they were tied before i let go 
it s my fault too 
we all know how shaggy
and scooby can be 
but it s all right 
we just need to stay strong 
in control  and work fast 
come on  gang  let s get to the lab 
we ll figure a way out
of this jurassic jumble 
shaggy 
  we re screwups 
  yeah 
i guess  looking back  every time they
made a plan  we did screw it up somehow 
  i just never noticed before 
  me neither 
there s gotta be some way we can prove
that we actually belong in the gang 
we ve gotta do something
totally unlike us 
you know  scoob   
   we could act like real detectives 
really 
scooby doo  raise your right paw 
no  your right paw  your other paw 
repeat after me  from this day forward
we will no longer be our goofy selves 
we will be awesome detectives 
and we will act more like fred
and velma and daphne 
we will be terrific and fantastic
and spectacular   
   and cease to be  loser iffic  
 lame tastic  and  suck tacular   
suck tacular 
right  like  it s time to solve the mystery 
let s kick this investigation up to an 11 
what the heck are you guys doing 
we figured the first step
in solving a mystery   
   would be to wear the right attire 
i m sorry  daph 
but your go go boots didn t fit   
   me 
scooby  those so don t go
with that sweater 
really 
clues 
alas  what are these strange markings 
words 
words 
scooby doo  take notes 
  gotcha 
  come on  you kooks 
okay 
it s come back positive 
this is a real pterodactyl scale 
precisely 
that masked figure
was out to humiliate us 
maybe it s someone we unmasked 
but who would be able to make
a real pterodactyl ghost 
the original pterodactyl ghost 
dr  jonathan jacobo 
that s right 
jacobo wreaked havoc
in a statewide crime spree 
jacobo stole millions   
    which he used to finance his failed
experiments trying to create monsters 
come alive  come alive 
you think jacobo  s behind this 
impossible  three years ago
he attempted a prison escape 
so long  suckers 
help me  suckers 
his body was lost at sea 
how about this  jacobo s cellmate
was released from prison two months ago 
jeremiah wickles 
the black knight ghost  that was
one of the costumes that was stolen 
right  and   
scooby doo  what s your conclusion 
bunny 
it seems old man wickles
deserves a visit   
    before any of our other creepy
conquests make a comeback 
freddy  up on the right 
old man wickles  ancestral manor 
oh  man  another creepy crib 
how come we can t ever investigate 
like  a kfc or something 
shaggy 
all right  then again 
creepy is my middle name 
scoob 
come on  scoob 
looks like a bit of a fixer upper 
nice job last night  losers 
quick  we need to think of a comeback 
what dorks 
hey  shut up 
that s a good one 
you are trespassing on wickles manor 
  leave now or pay the price 
  what jerk makes that his doorbell 
dude 
he just said we d pay the price 
shaggy  shaggy  shaggy 
what could possibly happen
by ringing a doorbell 
help me 
shaggy 
i think i pulled something 
that s what can happen
by ringing a doorbell  fred  that 
at 7 p m   the owner
will be home to set you free 
you want to buy a box of cookies 
excuse me 
have you heard the good news 
yeah  there s cookies 
watch the junk 
sorry 
oh  brother 
the lock s on a laser thumbprint scanner 
  let me just get to my makeup 
  daph  now 
you know what  velma  it s never too late
to learn to properly apply makeup 
okay  the last good thumbprint
should still be there  so   
   a little blush   
   a pore strip   
   and voil√† 
all right  daph 
i enjoy being a girl 
  thank you 
  see if i can get my mechanic s job back 
  twenty  30  40   
  thanks for the cookies 
   50    welcome 
sixty  70  80   
okay  gang  let s  like 
split up and search for clues 
scoob and i will go this way 
come on  scoob 
he stole my thing that i say 
search for clues  search for clues 
a clue 
shiny footprints 
the glow is similar
to the pterodactyl scale 
a clue 
it looks like wickles shares jacobo s
fascination with the supernatural 
he collects everything
from piri reis to aleister crowley 
he collects dust too 
no  the dust is good 
we can tell what he s been reading lately 
like here 
what is it 
it s an obsolete celtic text used by
secret societies in the mid 19th century 
look  the book belonged to j  jacobo 
the original pterodactyl ghost 
maybe he gave it to wickles
before he died 
can you read it 
it s an amalgamation
of magic and science 
here s a list of ingredients   
   on how to create
your own carbon based   
   organic  composite predators 
this is an instruction manual
on how to create monsters 
scoob 
clues 
those aren t clues  scoob 
those are just things you want 
like  why is a toilet brush a clue 
just because you can sing in it doesn t
make it a clue  it makes it awesome 
like  what s this 
 the faux ghost   
we re in luck 
it s tonight  scoob 
  we are detectives 
  really 
you found an actual clue 
i found a clue 
do the clue dance  do the clue dance 
we re going back  we re going back 
black knight ghost 
run  shaggy 
let s go 
like  lock the door 
heavy stuff  scoob 
give me a hand  scoob 
see him get through this 
heavy 
we outsmarted that moron 
yeah  what a moron 
look at me 
  thanks 
  you re welcome 
  yo  metalhead 
  yes 
bring it 
he brought it 
daphne  hold him off 
i ll look in the book 
maybe there s a formula
for finding his weakness 
here   to find a creature s
weakest point   
   take the angle between
the current position of the sun   
   and your geographical point    
  velma 
 add this point  28 and a half feet up
from sea level   
that tickles 
this is bad 
 multiply this number    
 add the square inches of    
velma 
     the square root     
now it s good night  ladies 
     your x axis   
 and subtract 9034  that s your y axis   
look  no hands 
any time would be great  velma 
i m trying 
 subtract one  divide by b 
follow upward eight degrees north   
which makes his weakest point right here 
right in the roundtables 
run 
in your face  scooby dooby doo 
come on  scoob  inside 
i ll compare the glow of those footprints
to the pterodactyl scale 
we ll check out wickles  book 
dude  the faux ghost is an awesome
clue  but what do we do with it 
let s solve the mystery 
if we solve the mystery by ourselves   
   it would certainly prove to the gang
that we belong 
let s head to the faux ghost   
   find wickles  and see what he knows 
but first  let s give the gang
the old  slipperooney   
hey  guys 
scooby s feeling kind of   
   like he s got rabies 
we re just gonna go outside
to get some fresh air 
jinkies 
what s up  velms 
the analysis of the pterodactyl scale 
it contains randamonium 
which this books says   
   is the critical ingredient
needed to make monsters 
doesn t randamonium glow 
like those footprints in wickles  mansion 
if we prove wickles is behind this 
this mystery goes down like a dot com   
   and coolsville digs us again 
  where would he get randamonium 
randamonium is the byproduct
of silver mines 
like the abandoned mining town
in old coolsville 
then we better get to that mining town
and see what s   
i m invisible  i m invisible 
get rid of him 
keep him busy 
what are you doing 
he wants to ask me on a date 
it s okay to be scared 
i am not scared 
i ve fought werewolves and ghosts 
but in the end  we usually unmask them
and it s a little scared man inside 
it s the same with dating 
velma  have you ever considered
that maybe werewolves and ghosts   
   are just distractions to keep you away
from what really frightens you 
intimacy with another person 
and by intimacy  i mean someone
who thinks you re really hot 
but i m more comfortable
in the world of logic and facts 
and   
   i m not hot 
me neither 
everybody has flaws  velma 
the object of a healthy relationship   
   is to never let the other person
know they re there 
  to museums 
  to museums 
daph  i really like this guy 
what would you do if someone thought   
   that you were some glamorous
and mysterious jet setter 
i d make myself one 
who s your mommy 
my mommy 
come on  let s solve a mystery 
  do you have to go to the bathroom 
  no  i can t in this outfit 
okay  scooby doo  the coast is clear 
here we go 
that s it  scoob  the faux ghost 
man  i recognize a lot of these cats 
like  that s c l  magnus 
he used to dress up as redbeard s ghost 
and that s aggie wilkins 
a k a  the ozark witch 
these are all folks we unmasked 
if they spot us 
they ll invite us to a weenie roast 
one where we re the weenies 
hot dogs 
there s gotta be some way that we can
use our awesome  fearless new skills   
   to get us in there
without being recognized 
everyone part like the red sea 
it s me  shizzy mccreepy 
and my brother  s d  mccrawley 
we are in the house and ready to party 
hey  handsome 
hello  baby 
  zoinks 
  jinkies 
  hey  gang 
  jinkies 
  hey 
  yipe 
a ghost clown is a heck of a lot scarier
than a cotton candy glob 
watch out  idiot 
  old man wickles 
  leave me alone 
no 
i just wanted to say thank you 
your portrayal of the black knight ghost
was inspirational to my brother and me 
have you done anything cool
and creepy lately 
listen  i m not normally one
for giving advice   
   but i feel sorry for you because
of your brother s hideous nose deformity 
get out of this game
while you got a chance 
all of us here ain t nothing to admire 
we needed people to believe
we were different than we were 
maybe because we believed   
   that there was something wrong
with who we were in the first place 
i guess you re sort of grateful
to mystery inc   
   for unmasking you 
  are you kidding 
if i see those twerps 
i d tear their eyes out of their skulls 
make them eat the one eye while watching
themselves eat it with the other eye 
bye 
here s a clue for you 
that dude s wearing his freak hat 24 7 
i gotta take a whiz 
don t do anything to attract attention 
gotcha 
hey  doll 
you wanna dance 
groovy 
here we go 
shake it  baby 
give me five 
oh  yeah 
everybody 
oh  yeah 
hey  shaggy 
it s scooby doo  the meddling mutt
what helped throw us in jail 
who  me 
no  wait  that s not scooby doo 
that s s d  mccrawley 
he s just wearing a mask 
and that s doo s beatnik best pal 
shaggy rogers 
  where 
  there 
zoinks  gangway 
run  shaggy  wait for me 
and stay out 
that wasn t so bad  scoob 
that was my outfit  i swear 
you know  velma 
you are as beautiful as ever 
you re just so different than i expected 
you know  i m just   
  oh  my goodness 
  what the heck s going on 
this cannot be good 
my museum 
wait 
any comments on the museum robbery 
mystery inc  is investigating
the two stolen costumes 
no  the one that just happened 
where the black knight and pterodactyl
ghost stole the rest of the costumes 
the rest of the costumes 
so  what you re saying is
it s all downhill for mystery inc 
no  you re doing that thing again where
you take everything i say out of context 
you re trying to make it look
like i think coolsville sucks 
no  don t record that 
patrick  i m so sorry 
it must be so hard for you 
i m sorry  i have to go  okay 
  i ll go with you   
  no  just   
no  i have to figure out what s going on 
all fred jones had to say was 
i think coolsville sucks 
in light of the city s recent chaos   
    jones   response was disheartening
to the fans who have supported them 
perhaps it s time for the crime solving
gang to shape up or ship out 
i ll be right back 
this is heather jasper howe
for investigative probe reporting 
what s with the personal attacks 
look  i m a huge fan  it s just my editor   
who are you kidding 
who are you kidding 
don t think i don t know your game 
what do you do for the gang 
really 
velma s the smart one  fred s the leader 
all you are is a pretty little face 
why are you doing this 
because it s my job to unmask
those who pretend to be who they re not 
 unmask those   you sound like   
sound like who 
the evil masked guy 
but you know that  because
just as you know i m standing here   
   you know i know
who you know you are   
   which is him  who s a her 
which is you 
now i see what you do for the gang 
you re in charge of incoherent babbling 
mystery incorporated 
once again  you are proven useless
before my power 
because of you  soon coolsville   
   will be mine 
darn it 
thanks a lot 
the scoop of the night  gone 
can t you do anything right 
ned  get your camera and follow me 
guess not 
stop wasting my time 
you hear me  now i want you to question
all your scum bucket friends 
find out what they know
about those stolen costumes 
or else you ll be known
as the soiled underwear ghost 
i want answers  now  go  now 
yes  sir 
  sorry 
  it s okay 
patrick 
shaggy  scooby 
what are you guys doing here 
we just came down here
to be undercover and stuff 
me too 
my museum got broken into again   
   so i had to come here
and try and get some answers 
gotta put on the tough guy act 
or these guys will eat me alive 
what s the matter  you don t believe me 
i m kidding 
  it s the tough guy act 
  that s good 
i got you 
that was a joke  that was good 
you re a lot of fun  try it  scoob 
it needs work 
look  patrick   
   we could stay here  do this all night 
and something tells me you would   
   but we gotta make
like your personality and split 
okay 
scooby doo  scoob 
hello 
scooby doo  can you hear me 
hello  shaggy 
wickles has led us
into a terrifying ghost town 
  ghost town 
  yes  a ghost town 
darn bushes yowling at me again 
  keep quiet  scoob 
  okay  shaggy 
like  where did old man nutjob go 
through here  scoob 
i don t know 
oh  boy 
run  scoob  it s a  skelly  thingy 
elevator 
good work  pal 
like  let s skedaddle 
so  what s your assessment  velmster 
this place seems harmless enough 
i mean  whether the evil masked figure
could ve gotten his randamonium   
   from here at the mine 
  oh  sorry 
i was just thinking about patrick 
he seemed so upset when he left 
  right  so   
  and   
   he doesn t like me 
okay  so your assessment is 
  love stinks 
  fred 
do you think i m just a pretty face 
no 
i mean  yes 
i mean  not fat 
definitely not fat 
is this sort of what you re looking for 
fat  why would you even use that word 
never again will they underestimate us 
that s right 
i ve gathered you here today
for something big 
at last 
all these years of careful planning   
   have culminated
in this one glorious moment 
old man wickles  caught red handed
in your foul monster making scheme 
with your ugly  evil henchmen 
henchmen 
young man  we re investors 
and we re listening to his pitch 
so as i was saying   
   the old tyme mining town 
a summer camp for kids   
   where they can have
an authentic mining experience 
they can dig for 18 hours straight 
just like in the golden days of yore 
they have the time of their lives 
and we get free miners 
mr  wickles  we need to ask you about   
   your ties to recent monster attacks 
  i don t know nothing about no monsters 
then how come there was randamonium
on the floor of your mansion 
there s randamonium all over the place 
i come home with it in my shorts 
are you continuing the work
of your old pal jonathan jacobo 
old pal  jacobo 
we hated each other 
in the prison cafeteria 
he used to steal my tater tots 
and he got the lead in my fair lady 
then why did we find the monster book
in your library 
wait a second  you re the runts
what vandalized my home 
which one of you stole my toilet brush 
gentlemen 
  i m sorry  jeremiah 
  what happened  i haven t finished 
wait  fellas 
wowee  scooby doo 
i think we re onto something 
it s like a huge laboratory 
  go ahead 
  okay 
this place is like clue topia  scoob 
refrigerator 
lemonade 
check it out 
look at those weird letters  scoob 
shaggy 
scooby doo 
you turned into a freaky monster 
you don t eat stuff that glows 
there s got to be an antidote
in here somewhere

tastes like   
strawberries 
i m okay  scoob 
i ve got a chick s body 
i m the tasmanian devil 
check it out  dude 
i m buff 
my god 
it seems as if i ve become
ludicrously intelligent 
it s awful  i long for the blissful ignorance
of my former self 
chasing cats  licking my own rear end 
eating my own vomit 
those were wonderful times 
check out my pecs  little man 
hush now  buffoon 
this is a highly combustible synthesis 
a what 
i m going to transform us back 
no way  geek 
i m gonna stay this way forever 
no 
let s go 
careful  gang 
this  schwarzeneggian  oaf
almost destroyed us

you are embarrassing 
that was almost exactly like
my freshman year in college 
what are you guys doing here 
you re supposed to be sick  scooby 
i invented a potion 
you lied to us  we re a team 
you don t just go off half cocked
doing whatever you want 
hey  gang 
 beware who enters the monster hive 
inside your fears will come alive   
oh  my 
look  it s the costumes
from the museum 
  zombie 
  miner 49er 
  captain cutler 
  i bet they re all here 
he must have used the costumes
to make real monsters  which implies   
he needs the costumes to make
the monsters  which implies   
he already had a pterodactyl ghost
costume somehow  which implies   
patrick s the one 
velma s in love 
no  i mean the one 
the bad guy 
that s why he wanted to go out with me 
to see what we knew 
we just saw patrick
at the bad guys  hangout 
he was working both sides
of psycho street 
i don t know who s behind this 
but we don t need him   
   transforming more costumes 
let s find a way to shut down
this monster maker for good 
guys  what s over here 
this light is strange 
scooby doo 
we re the ones that found this place 
score one for the big guys 
now we need to keep acting
like mondo groovy detectives  come on

unlike some of you 
i have a very important meeting 
citizens  turn in mystery inc

my monsters can make life
very unpleasant 
find me mystery inc   now 
heather jasper howe with an emergency
update for investigative probe 
a monster army has invaded coolsville 
angry citizens have gathered
outside mystery inc   s offices in protest 
they re insisting the gang cooperate
with the evil masked figure s demands 
mystery stink  mystery stink 
excuse me  sir 
do you have anything to say for yourself 
i beg you  mystery inc 
if you can hear me  turn yourselves in 
if we do  he ll get the control panel back 
and the city will be in worse shape 
we d be playing right into his hands 
please  for our city s sake 
sorry  you re cancelled 
the old high school clubhouse 
we should be safe here 
we haven t been here in years 
freddy  are you okay 
  do you wanna talk 
  talking s for wimps 
it s time for action 
you know  scoob   
   this evil masked figure
is turning coolsville into ghoulsville 
and the gang is totally taking a hit for it 
like  this is the most  our faultiest 
screwup ever  scoob 
still works 
look  all my old tools 
after all our so called success   
   we re back in this old firetrap 
hit me  fred 
good throw  velm 
  mine 
  gotcha 
throw it to me 
  go long 
  okay 
go  scooby doo 
dude 
it all seemed so easy back then 
we solved mysteries for the love of them 
not to prove anything to anyone 
and the mysteries all seemed
to unravel themselves 
sometimes  the answers
would just appear like magic 
my first multiple resonance
imaging device 
made out of a crystal radio
and old video games 
wait a minute 
randamonium has an algorithmic
cross currency of negative 4  121 
with it  maybe   
well  just maybe   
we could reverse the current
and reverse the monster making process 
all we need to do
is rewire the control panel   
bring it back to the monster hive
and plug it into the base 
  push the button   
  and instead of creating monsters   
   all the monsters will be destroyed 
like  they re totally having
a montage in there without us 
i ll tell you one thing for sure 
they don t need our help to figure it out 
we re screwups 
the only time we do anything right   
   is when we accidentally plow
into the snow ghost   
   because we ve accidentally glued our
feet to rocket powered roller skates 
eight stupid times 
face it  scoob 
we ll never be anything
but our old goofy selves 
i wish once   
   just once   
   i could do the right thing on purpose 
you know  scoob 
like  be a hero   
   and save the day 
but who are we kidding  right

and all the facts say
that you re the evil masked figure 
what does your heart say 
i don t know 
it s beating too loud for me to hear 
look deeper  you gotta trust me 
you saved my life 
patrick 
velma 
that thing just flew off with patrick 
the best we can do for him is get
that control panel back where it belongs 
where is it 
i gave it to shaggy and scooby 
that s weird  it sounded like you just said
you gave it to shaggy and scooby 
i think we lost them 
scoob  we made it

now you re stuck in here with me 
the cotton candy glob 
  cotton candy glob

poor guys are probably running around
helpless and terrified 
this is like the greatest day
of our lives  scoob

we could sink our teeth into 
i m kind of thirsty  i wonder if there s
a liter sized soda glob anywhere 
  come on  guys  we have to hurry

control panel back before

dude 
  like  frostbite never felt so good

rail glide

  roll barrel 
hang time 
end of the line  doo 
come here  you worthless mutt 
scoob 
you can do it  buddy 
you can t do this to me 
who do you think you are 
scooby   
   dooby   
   doo 
no 
my monsters 
you did it  you saved us all 
i know 
do you know the identity
of the evil masked figure behind it all 
if our hunch is correct 
the evil masked figure is   
no 
heather jasper howe 
but she was at the museum
when the masked figure was on the roof 
you almost had me there  didn t you 
lucky for her  she had an assistant
helping her with her evil plans 
ned 
when i realized
she was the evil masked figure   
    he quickly changed into her costume 
but why did she do it 
because heather jasper howe
is actually   
   doctor jonathan jacobo 
the original pterodactyl ghost 
but how do you know this 
a photo  taken of jacobo
in front of the coolsonian 
jacobo supposedly died
a year before construction even began 
so jacobo survived that fall
off the prison wall 
he adapted the false heather jasper howe
persona to turn the press against us 
then he framed old man wickles   
   by putting that book and
the black knight ghost in his mansion 
as if you getting the lead
in my fair lady wasn t enough 
i was an excellent eliza 
you were too act y 
and stealing my tater tots 
you kept saying you felt puffy 
and the real identity of ned is   
ned 
i would have gotten away with it
if it weren t for those meddling punks   
   and their dumb dog 
  you were a dude this whole time 
  of course  dummkopf 
but we cuddled 
  hi 
  hi 
listen  velma  i know
that must have seemed very suspicious   
   but you ve got to believe me
that i had nothing to do with   
i trust you 
listen  patrick 
i m not glamorous or mysterious 
but one thing that s true is   
   that i like you 
very much 
and i would like
to go out with you again 
but this time  i will go as myself 
yeah  i d like that  more than anything 
okay 
mystery inc   mystery inc  
they re cheering for us again 
yep 
i always thought that was
the best thing in the world 
i guess i found something
a little bit better 
  can we get your photo in this
