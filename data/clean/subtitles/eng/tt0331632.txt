at the exploits of mystery incorporated
and here they are
folks this crowd is going crazy
over mystery inc

may i have a word
with coolsvilles hottest detectives
absolutely
thats your word
come on dear were late
heather jasperhowe
at the grand opening
of the new coolsonian
criminology museum
with our guests of honor the master
detectives of mystery incorporated
shaggy
right on
hello hello
with all your success will you still
have time for us in little old coolsville
of course little old coolsville
can solve its problems without us
but well always be here to help
the people of coolsville
are the best in the world
can you tell us a little about the exhibit
absolutely
mystery inc is proud to donate the
costumes of criminals weve unmasked
like the black knight ghost
our very first case
the 10000 volt ghost
the skeleton men
and even the dreaded pterodactyl ghost
weve also donated the costumes
of some of our more ridiculous foes
like chickenstein
can we get a shot of you
next to the black night
ridiculous obviously she forgot
that dude tried to pluck us
remember what i told you
never pick your nose in public
no but thats good too
image is everything
yes lmage is everything
the whole citys watching
so try and keep a brave face
theyre costumes
right
shes right scoob
up close they look totally fake
the tar monster scared the locals
of byzantius away to take their treasure
but on the positive side
hed pave your driveway for free
isnt that right velma
velma
hi
hi
daphne this is patrick wisely
hes the curator here at the museum
its very nice to meet you patrick
i hope youll be working closely with
velma on this everexpanding exhibit
i know that youre a glamorous
mysterious jetset adventurer
preoccupied with
international intrigue and all
yes thats me
i know but
theres a symposium coming up on
syntactic reasoning in the criminal brain
i have always found
a criminals inclination
to incorrectly use the interrogative
pronoun in place of the relative
delightfully absurd
me too
really
so maybe youd want to go together
suppose you mean like
like a
like a date with me
no i cant patrick
mystery is my mistress
i must heed her sweet call
okay
whats happening
oh boy
daphne
go ned get it get it
we need to come up with a plan
hiding is our plan
in case you havent noticed theres
an unidentified freaky object in here
the curtains
were on them
come on you chickens grab those ropes
but chickens arent good with ropes
we got him
shaggy use the ropes to tie him up
its just a costume
its just a costume
its just a costume
we tied it let go
sorry
we have to save shaggy and scooby
as usual
fire
mystery incorporated
this is only the first rung
on the ladder of your demise
look out
and this time
youll be the ones unmasked
as the buffoons you truly are
any clues to the cause of the attack how
did the dinosaur get through security
where did mystery incs plan go wrong
a secret hatch
the real pterodactyl ghost
must have come through here
a reptilian scale
a most wonderful clue
he stole two costumes the black knight
ghost and the 10000 volt ghost why
fred daphne could you answer
a few questions for the press
fred i dont think
thats a really good idea
we always face the press
after weve unmasked the creeps
we looked ridiculous back there
dont worry about it sweetheart
the press loves us
the higher the pedestal
the harder the fall
and mystery inc fell far
in the embarrassing debacle
that tarnished the reputation
of the oncegreat gang
it was an utter disaster
as two of the gangs key members
norville shaggy rogers
and scoobert scoobydoo
caused untold damage to coolsvilles
hottest new tourist attraction
which took a full two years to complete
when asked for comment fred jones
leader of mystery inc said this
coolsville can solve its
problems without us
i didnt say that i mean
i did but thats out of context
this is heather jasperhowe
disillusioned from coolsville
its all my fault
im the one who told shaggy
and scooby to get the ropes
no velma its my fault
i should have checked
that they were tied before i let go
its my fault too
we all know how shaggy
and scooby can be
but its all right
we just need to stay strong
in control and work fast
come on gang lets get to the lab
well figure a way out
of this jurassic jumble
shaggy
were screwups
yeah
i guess looking back every time they
made a plan we did screw it up somehow
i just never noticed before
me neither
theres gotta be some way we can prove
that we actually belong in the gang
weve gotta do something
totally unlike us
you know scoob
we could act like real detectives
really
scoobydoo raise your right paw
no your right paw your other paw
repeat after me from this day forward
we will no longer be our goofy selves
we will be awesome detectives
and we will act more like fred
and velma and daphne
we will be terrific and fantastic
and spectacular
and cease to be loseriffic
lametastic and sucktacular
sucktacular
right like its time to solve the mystery
lets kick this investigation up to an 11
what the heck are you guys doing
we figured the first step
in solving a mystery
would be to wear the right attire
im sorry daph
but your gogo boots didnt fit
me
scooby those so dont go
with that sweater
really
clues
alas what are these strange markings
words
words
scoobydoo take notes
gotcha
come on you kooks
okay
its come back positive
this is a real pterodactyl scale
precisely
that masked figure
was out to humiliate us
maybe its someone we unmasked
but who would be able to make
a real pterodactyl ghost
the original pterodactyl ghost
dr jonathan jacobo
thats right
jacobo wreaked havoc
in a statewide crime spree
jacobo stole millions
which he used to finance his failed
experiments trying to create monsters
come alive come alive
you think jacobo s behind this
impossible three years ago
he attempted a prison escape
so long suckers
help me suckers
his body was lost at sea
how about this jacobos cellmate
was released from prison two months ago
jeremiah wickles
the black knight ghost that was
one of the costumes that was stolen
right and
scoobydoo whats your conclusion
bunny
it seems old man wickles
deserves a visit
before any of our other creepy
conquests make a comeback
freddy up on the right
old man wickles ancestral manor
oh man another creepy crib
how come we cant ever investigate
like a kfc or something
shaggy
all right then again
creepy is my middle name
scoob
come on scoob
looks like a bit of a fixerupper
nice job last night losers
quick we need to think of a comeback
what dorks
hey shut up
thats a good one
you are trespassing on wickles manor
leave now or pay the price
what jerk makes that his doorbell
dude
he just said wed pay the price
shaggy shaggy shaggy
what could possibly happen
by ringing a doorbell
help me
shaggy
i think i pulled something
thats what can happen
by ringing a doorbell fred that
at 7 pm the owner
will be home to set you free
you want to buy a box of cookies
excuse me
have you heard the good news
yeah theres cookies
watch the junk
sorry
oh brother
the locks on a laser thumbprint scanner
let me just get to my makeup
daph now
you know what velma its never too late
to learn to properly apply makeup
okay the last good thumbprint
should still be there so
a little blush
a pore strip
and voil√†
all right daph
i enjoy being a girl
thank you
see if i can get my mechanics job back
twenty 30 40
thanks for the cookies
50 welcome
sixty 70 80
okay gang lets like
split up and search for clues
scoob and i will go this way
come on scoob
he stole my thing that i say
search for clues search for clues
a clue
shiny footprints
the glow is similar
to the pterodactyl scale
a clue
it looks like wickles shares jacobos
fascination with the supernatural
he collects everything
from piri reis to aleister crowley
he collects dust too
no the dust is good
we can tell what hes been reading lately
like here
what is it
its an obsolete celtic text used by
secret societies in the mid19th century
look the book belonged to j jacobo
the original pterodactyl ghost
maybe he gave it to wickles
before he died
can you read it
its an amalgamation
of magic and science
heres a list of ingredients
on how to create
your own carbonbased
organic composite predators
this is an instruction manual
on how to create monsters
scoob
clues
those arent clues scoob
those are just things you want
like why is a toilet brush a clue
just because you can sing in it doesnt
make it a clue it makes it awesome
like whats this
the faux ghost
were in luck
its tonight scoob
we are detectives
really
you found an actual clue
i found a clue
do the clue dance do the clue dance
were going back were going back
black knight ghost
run shaggy
lets go
like lock the door
heavy stuff scoob
give me a hand scoob
see him get through this
heavy
we outsmarted that moron
yeah what a moron
look at me
thanks
youre welcome
yo metalhead
yes
bring it
he brought it
daphne hold him off
ill look in the book
maybe theres a formula
for finding his weakness
here to find a creatures
weakest point
take the angle between
the current position of the sun
and your geographical point
velma
add this point 28 and a half feet up
from sea level
that tickles
this is bad
multiply this number
add the square inches of
velma
the square root
now its good night ladies
your xaxis
and subtract 9034 thats your yaxis
look no hands
any time would be great velma
im trying
subtract one divide by b
follow upward eight degrees north
which makes his weakest point right here
right in the roundtables
run
in your face scoobydoobydoo
come on scoob inside
ill compare the glow of those footprints
to the pterodactyl scale
well check out wickles book
dude the faux ghost is an awesome
clue but what do we do with it
lets solve the mystery
if we solve the mystery by ourselves
it would certainly prove to the gang
that we belong
lets head to the faux ghost
find wickles and see what he knows
but first lets give the gang
the old slipperooney
hey guys
scoobys feeling kind of
like hes got rabies
were just gonna go outside
to get some fresh air
jinkies
whats up velms
the analysis of the pterodactyl scale
it contains randamonium
which this books says
is the critical ingredient
needed to make monsters
doesnt randamonium glow
like those footprints in wickles mansion
if we prove wickles is behind this
this mystery goes down like a dotcom
and coolsville digs us again
where would he get randamonium
randamonium is the byproduct
of silver mines
like the abandoned mining town
in old coolsville
then we better get to that mining town
and see whats
im invisible im invisible
get rid of him
keep him busy
what are you doing
he wants to ask me on a date
its okay to be scared
i am not scared
ive fought werewolves and ghosts
but in the end we usually unmask them
and its a little scared man inside
its the same with dating
velma have you ever considered
that maybe werewolves and ghosts
are just distractions to keep you away
from what really frightens you
intimacy with another person
and by intimacy i mean someone
who thinks youre really hot
but im more comfortable
in the world of logic and facts
and
im not hot
me neither
everybody has flaws velma
the object of a healthy relationship
is to never let the other person
know theyre there
to museums
to museums
daph i really like this guy
what would you do if someone thought
that you were some glamorous
and mysterious jetsetter
id make myself one
whos your mommy
my mommy
come on lets solve a mystery
do you have to go to the bathroom
no i cant in this outfit
okay scoobydoo the coast is clear
here we go
thats it scoob the faux ghost
man i recognize a lot of these cats
like thats cl magnus
he used to dress up as redbeards ghost
and thats aggie wilkins
aka the ozark witch
these are all folks we unmasked
if they spot us
theyll invite us to a weenie roast
one where were the weenies
hot dogs
theres gotta be some way that we can
use our awesome fearless new skills
to get us in there
without being recognized
everyone part like the red sea
its me shizzy mccreepy
and my brother sd mccrawley
we are in the house and ready to party
hey handsome
hello baby
zoinks
jinkies
hey gang
jinkies
hey
yipe
a ghost clown is a heck of a lot scarier
than a cotton candy glob
watch out idiot
old man wickles
leave me alone
no
i just wanted to say thank you
your portrayal of the black knight ghost
was inspirational to my brother and me
have you done anything cool
and creepy lately
listen im not normally one
for giving advice
but i feel sorry for you because
of your brothers hideous nose deformity
get out of this game
while you got a chance
all of us here aint nothing to admire
we needed people to believe
we were different than we were
maybe because we believed
that there was something wrong
with who we were in the first place
i guess youre sort of grateful
to mystery inc
for unmasking you
are you kidding
if i see those twerps
id tear their eyes out of their skulls
make them eat the one eye while watching
themselves eat it with the other eye
bye
heres a clue for you
that dudes wearing his freak hat 247
i gotta take a whiz
dont do anything to attract attention
gotcha
hey doll
you wanna dance
groovy
here we go
shake it baby
give me five
oh yeah
everybody
oh yeah
hey shaggy
its scoobydoo the meddling mutt
what helped throw us in jail
who me
no wait thats not scoobydoo
thats sd mccrawley
hes just wearing a mask
and thats doos beatnik best pal
shaggy rogers
where
there
zoinks gangway
run shaggy wait for me
and stay out
that wasnt so bad scoob
that was my outfit i swear
you know velma
you are as beautiful as ever
youre just so different than i expected
you know im just
oh my goodness
what the hecks going on
this cannot be good
my museum
wait
any comments on the museum robbery
mystery inc is investigating
the two stolen costumes
no the one that just happened
where the black knight and pterodactyl
ghost stole the rest of the costumes
the rest of the costumes
so what youre saying is
its all downhill for mystery inc
no youre doing that thing again where
you take everything i say out of context
youre trying to make it look
like i think coolsville sucks
no dont record that
patrick im so sorry
it must be so hard for you
im sorry i have to go okay
ill go with you
no just
no i have to figure out whats going on
all fred jones had to say was
i think coolsville sucks
in light of the citys recent chaos
jones  response was disheartening
to the fans who have supported them
perhaps its time for the crimesolving
gang to shape up or ship out
ill be right back
this is heather jasperhowe
for investigative probe reporting
whats with the personal attacks
look im a huge fan its just my editor
who are you kidding
who are you kidding
dont think i dont know your game
what do you do for the gang
really
velmas the smart one freds the leader
all you are is a pretty little face
why are you doing this
because its my job to unmask
those who pretend to be who theyre not
unmask those you sound like
sound like who
the evil masked guy
but you know that because
just as you know im standing here
you know i know
who you know you are
which is him whos a her
which is you
now i see what you do for the gang
youre in charge of incoherent babbling
mystery incorporated
once again you are proven useless
before my power
because of you soon coolsville
will be mine
darn it
thanks a lot
the scoop of the night gone
cant you do anything right
ned get your camera and follow me
guess not
stop wasting my time
you hear me now i want you to question
all your scumbucket friends
find out what they know
about those stolen costumes
or else youll be known
as the soiled underwear ghost
i want answers now go now
yes sir
sorry
its okay
patrick
shaggy scooby
what are you guys doing here
we just came down here
to be undercover and stuff
me too
my museum got broken into again
so i had to come here
and try and get some answers
gotta put on the toughguy act
or these guys will eat me alive
whats the matter you dont believe me
im kidding
its the toughguy act
thats good
i got you
that was a joke that was good
youre a lot of fun try it scoob
it needs work
look patrick
we could stay here do this all night
and something tells me you would
but we gotta make
like your personality and split
okay
scoobydoo scoob
hello
scoobydoo can you hear me
hello shaggy
wickles has led us
into a terrifying ghost town
ghost town
yes a ghost town
darn bushes yowling at me again
keep quiet scoob
okay shaggy
like where did old man nutjob go
through here scoob
i dont know
oh boy
run scoob its a skelly thingy
elevator
good work pal
like lets skedaddle
so whats your assessment velmster
this place seems harmless enough
i mean whether the evil masked figure
couldve gotten his randamonium
from here at the mine
oh sorry
i was just thinking about patrick
he seemed so upset when he left
right so
and
he doesnt like me
okay so your assessment is
love stinks
fred
do you think im just a pretty face
no
i mean yes
i mean not fat
definitely not fat
is this sort of what youre looking for
fat why would you even use that word
never again will they underestimate us
thats right
ive gathered you here today
for something big
at last
all these years of careful planning
have culminated
in this one glorious moment
old man wickles caught redhanded
in your foul monstermaking scheme
with your ugly evil henchmen
henchmen
young man were investors
and were listening to his pitch
so as i was saying
the old tyme mining town
a summer camp for kids
where they can have
an authentic mining experience
they can dig for 18 hours straight
just like in the golden days of yore
they have the time of their lives
and we get free miners
mr wickles we need to ask you about
your ties to recent monster attacks
i dont know nothing about no monsters
then how come there was randamonium
on the floor of your mansion
theres randamonium all over the place
i come home with it in my shorts
are you continuing the work
of your old pal jonathan jacobo
old pal jacobo
we hated each other
in the prison cafeteria
he used to steal my tater tots
and he got the lead in my fair lady
then why did we find the monster book
in your library
wait a second youre the runts
what vandalized my home
which one of you stole my toilet brush
gentlemen
im sorry jeremiah
what happened i havent finished
wait fellas
wowee scoobydoo
i think were onto something
its like a huge laboratory
go ahead
okay
this place is like cluetopia scoob
refrigerator
lemonade
check it out
look at those weird letters scoob
shaggy
scoobydoo
you turned into a freaky monster
you dont eat stuff that glows
theres got to be an antidote
in here somewhere
try this scoob it looks medicinal
tastes like
strawberries
im okay scoob
ive got a chicks body
im the tasmanian devil
check it out dude
im buff
my god
it seems as if ive become
ludicrously intelligent
its awful i long for the blissful ignorance
of my former self
chasing cats licking my own rear end
eating my own vomit
those were wonderful times
check out my pecs little man
hush now buffoon
this is a highly combustible synthesis
a what
im going to transform us back
no way geek
im gonna stay this way forever
no
lets go
careful gang
this schwarzeneggian oaf
almost destroyed us
go boom
you are embarrassing
that was almost exactly like
my freshman year in college
what are you guys doing here
youre supposed to be sick scooby
i invented a potion
you lied to us were a team
you dont just go off halfcocked
doing whatever you want
hey gang
beware who enters the monster hive
inside your fears will come alive
oh my
look its the costumes
from the museum
zombie
miner 49er
captain cutler
i bet theyre all here
he must have used the costumes
to make real monsters which implies
he needs the costumes to make
the monsters which implies
he already had a pterodactyl ghost
costume somehow which implies
patricks the one
velmas in love
no i mean the one
the bad guy
thats why he wanted to go out with me
to see what we knew
we just saw patrick
at the bad guys hangout
he was working both sides
of psycho street
i dont know whos behind this
but we dont need him
transforming more costumes
lets find a way to shut down
this monstermaker for good
guys whats over here
this light is strange
scoobydoo
were the ones that found this place
score one for the big guys
now we need to keep acting
like mondogroovy detectives come on
like wowee
cool like tuneage
like whats that weird sound
captain cutler
miner 49er
the tar monster
we have
to remain
calm
calm scoobydoo
youre not being calm
i needed that
i needed that too
youre pushing your luck scoob
you girls find anything
he did it
scoob
fred disconnect that control panel
maybe itll stop the machine
come on this way quick the elevator
like the 10000 volt ghost
come on scoob

think positive
were gonna die quickly
wait for me
come on girls

ive set out to do
hurry up gang

unlike some of you
i have a very important meeting
citizens turn in mystery inc
your reward well let you live
my monsters can make life
very unpleasant
find me mystery inc now
heather jasperhowe with an emergency
update for investigative probe
a monster army has invaded coolsville
angry citizens have gathered
outside mystery inc s offices in protest
theyre insisting the gang cooperate
with the evil masked figures demands
mystery stink mystery stink
excuse me sir
do you have anything to say for yourself
i beg you mystery inc
if you can hear me turn yourselves in
if we do hell get the control panel back
and the city will be in worse shape
wed be playing right into his hands
please for our citys sake
sorry youre cancelled
the old highschool clubhouse
we should be safe here
we havent been here in years
freddy are you okay
do you wanna talk
talkings for wimps
its time for action
you know scoob
this evil masked figure
is turning coolsville into ghoulsville
and the gang is totally taking a hit for it
like this is the most ourfaultiest
screwup ever scoob
still works
look all my old tools
after all our socalled success
were back in this old firetrap
hit me fred
good throw velm
mine
gotcha
throw it to me
go long
okay
go scoobydoo
dude
it all seemed so easy back then
we solved mysteries for the love of them
not to prove anything to anyone
and the mysteries all seemed
to unravel themselves
sometimes the answers
would just appear like magic
my first multipleresonance
imaging device
made out of a crystal radio
and old video games
wait a minute
randamonium has an algorithmic
crosscurrency of negative 4 121
with it maybe
well just maybe
we could reverse the current
and reverse the monstermaking process
all we need to do
is rewire the control panel
bring it back to the monster hive
and plug it into the base
push the button
and instead of creating monsters
all the monsters will be destroyed
like theyre totally having
a montage in there without us
ill tell you one thing for sure
they dont need our help to figure it out
were screwups
the only time we do anything right
is when we accidentally plow
into the snow ghost
because weve accidentally glued our
feet to rocketpowered rollerskates
eight stupid times
face it scoob
well never be anything
but our old goofy selves
i wish once
just once
i could do the right thing on purpose
you know scoob
like be a hero
and save the day
but who are we kidding right
captain cutlers ghost
captain cutlers ghost
they found us finish that in the van
when we get to the monster hive
come on guys in the van
hurry
go fred hit it
what do we do
what do we do
fine lets go back
thats the wrong way
shaggy give me a hand

i always wanted to be like you guys
you guys are so free youre never afraid
to be who you really are
whether youre fearful or joyful or hungry
i think youve been heroes all along
you just havent known it
here i go

and hes really mad
come on scoob
miner 49er
ill get you you varmints
dead end

blackout blackout
oh crap

oh brother not again
ive got to consider contact lenses
what
some kind of scary bat
wait a minute
thats the pterodactyl
the pterodactyl ghost
whats this
a shrine
to jonathan jacobo
but who would be so obsessed with him
velma
lose something
patrick
what are you doing here
im trying to solve this mystery
same as you
that is what youre doing right
trying to solve this mystery
yes
why are you so obsessed
with jonathan jacobo
what are you talking about
no way jose
velma
stay away from me
i know who you are
velma let go of the grate
so i can fall to my death
no so i can pull you up
you gotta trust me
no i only trust the facts
and all the facts say
that youre the evil masked figure
what does your heart say
i dont know
its beating too loud for me to hear
look deeper you gotta trust me
you saved my life
patrick
velma
that thing just flew off with patrick
the best we can do for him is get
that control panel back where it belongs
where is it
i gave it to shaggy and scooby
thats weird it sounded like you just said
you gave it to shaggy and scooby
i think we lost them
scoob we made it

my monsters
you did it you saved us all
i know
do you know the identity
of the evil masked figure behind it all
if our hunch is correct
the evil masked figure is
no
heather jasperhowe
but she was at the museum
when the masked figure was on the roof
you almost had me there didnt you
lucky for her she had an assistant
helping her with her evil plans
ned
when i realized
she was the evil masked figure
he quickly changed into her costume
but why did she do it
because heather jasperhowe
is actually
doctor jonathan jacobo
the original pterodactyl ghost
but how do you know this
a photo taken of jacobo
in front of the coolsonian
jacobo supposedly died
a year before construction even began
so jacobo survived that fall
off the prison wall
he adapted the false heather jasperhowe
persona to turn the press against us
then he framed old man wickles
by putting that book and
the black knight ghost in his mansion
as if you getting the lead
in my fair lady wasnt enough
i was an excellent eliza
you were too acty
and stealing my tater tots
you kept saying you felt puffy
and the real identity of ned is
ned
i would have gotten away with it
if it werent for those meddling punks
and their dumb dog
you were a dude this whole time
of course dummkopf
but we cuddled
hi
hi
listen velma i know
that must have seemed very suspicious
but youve got to believe me
that i had nothing to do with

listen patrick
im not glamorous or mysterious
but one thing thats true is
that i like you
very much
and i would like
to go out with you again
but this time i will go as myself
yeah id like that more than anything
