herb gorson  please 
here you go  babe 
peyton 
oops  sorry 
hello 
herb  hi 
it s julie hastings 
listen  i found some memos when i was
researching the von hoffenstein deal
that i don t think
i was supposed to find 
yeah 
what are they 
they re from strack to a guy
named claude bellasarious 
and they re records of payments to
various people on the zoning commission 
well  i think
they re payoffs 
if it s an accusation 
you better be sure 
yeah  well  what i want to
do is talk to strack first 
give him the benefit
of the doubt 
yeah  okay 
call me 
all right  i ll talk
to you later  herb  bye 
bye  herb 
oh  i don t want to go 
don t go 
don t go 
i have to go 
stay  stay 
i have to go now  i have to go now 
i m late 
julie 
i ll call you    later 
julie 
julie  wait 
what is it 
i ve been thinking 
we should get married 
marriage 
uh huh 
uh huh 
i ve just started getting
things going at the firm 
and i really like
having my own place 
but we re practically
living together now 
all marriage means is you answer
the phone in the morning 
and if it s my grandmother  you don t
pretend it s the wrong number 
the poor woman s beginning to
think she has alzheimer s 
i can t talk
about it now 
come here 
jules  i m asking you
to marry me 
peyt  i love you   
i mean 
i realized   
   but i got to
think it over  okay 
mr  strack  i ve been
going over some documents 
and i ve come across
something that puzzles me 
it s a memo from your office
to a mr  claude bellasarious 
it details
certain payments that   
yes  yes 
i know the memo 
well  it seems
like the payments were   
were payoffs
to the zoning commission 
bribes 
to call a spade a spade 
does that shock you 
no  i guessed as much 
you weren t supposed to know about it 
that file was not supposed to circulate 
however  i am asking you
to understand 
take a look
at that model  julie 
that s the dream 
acres of riverfront
reclaimed from decay 
thousands of jobs created 
a building block  a very large
building block laid for the future 
not such a bad dream 
as dreams go 
and if the price of realizing that dream
is the occasional distasteful chore 
well  i don t run away 
i say   so be it  
so   
want to book me 
the fact remains that i m in possession
of evidence of the commission of a crime 
well  let me suggest this  you
excuse yourself for a few minutes 
go to the ladies  room
leaving your briefcase here 
what happens to that memorandum
while it s in my custody
is my responsibility 
i wish it were that simple  but first
of all  i don t have the memo with me 
i m trying to protect you 
does the name robert durant
mean anything to you 
drugs  racketeering   
and real estate 
robert durant is a competitor
for the riverfront 
he s a very dangerous
man  julie 
and i fully believe he d do anything
to get his hands on that document 
dna content  acceptable 
glucose  right on 
we ve even checked the collagen congeners 
they re fine 
this is unbelievable  every day 
it s a different combination   
time  yakitito 
time 
ninety eight minutes 
oh  the circuit again 
i ll fix it 
i knew we were pulling
too much juice on that line 
yakitito  time 
huh 
time 
ninety nine 
one hundred minutes 
what  what 
the cells  they re holding 
they re stable 
but  dr  westlake 
why now 
the dark 
oh  of course 
the dark 
i think the synthetic cells
are photosensitive 
this is unbelievable 
what is it about
the dark 
what secret does it hold 
they re still stable 
time  yakitito  time 
101 minutes 
finally  we can replace
damaged skin tissue 
no  yakitito  no  not quite  my friend 
not yet 
all we ve got is a piece of the puzzle 
there s still the big question 
how to keep the cells stable
past 99 minutes in the light 
but at least now we know
it s all about light 
i ll get it 
no foolish heroics 
if you please 
we ve come
only for documents 
tell us where to find
the bellasarious memorandum 
and we shall disappear  like a
nightmare before the breaking day 
i don t know
what you re talking about 
how unfortunate 
what memorandum 
no  please 
we want the memorandum 
should your houseboy s
predicament not jog your memory 
you may bid him godspeed 
he s a lab assistant  for
god s sakes  let him breathe 
you heard the doctor 
ventilate him 
no  no 
  bingo 
  goody 
bring the asian s fingers 
gentlemen 
rick  i m proud of you 
clean through the brain 
that s how i like it 
 marry me  
didn t see you doing
much work out there 
that guy got blown to pieces 
all they found was an ear 
tiny little piece  didn t
take me long to bury that 
you ll be all right 
you ll be all right 
i m gonna
need some sponges 
okay 
you got them 
great  we ll get ready
to move him 
let s check
the eyes 
get a gurney in here 
right there 
straight in 
next  we have a 30  35 year old
male  no id  no medical history 
he was found on the riverbank
just south of the city 
there s a sizeable population of
homeless and indigents there 
we get at least three
no names like him every week 
nobody does anything
about the homeless
until they become train wrecks
like mr  john doe here 
he s got burns covering
over 40  of his body 
the hands and face
are the most severe 
ten years ago  pain from the burns
would have been intolerable 
this man would have spent the
rest of his life screaming 
now we use
the rangeberitz technique 
quite simply  we sever the nerves
within the spino thalamic tract  there 
which  as you know 
transmits neural impulses
of pain and vibratory sense
to the brain 
no longer receiving
impulses of pain 
you stick him with a pin   
ouch 
and he can t even
feel it 
as in many
radical procedures 
there are serious side
effects to this operation 
when the body ceases to feel  when
so much sensory input is lost 
the mind grows hungry 
starved of its regular diet of input  it
takes the only remaining stimulation it has 
the emotions 
and amplifies them 
giving rise to
alienation and loneliness 
uncontrolled rage
is not uncommon 
now surges of adrenaline flow
unchecked through the body and brain 
giving him augmented strength 
hence  the restraints 
naturally  we give them
every chance of recovery 
remain optimistic 
inspire confidence 
talk to him about
rehabilitation potential 
personally  i give him
a nine on the buzzard scale

what have you got  besides a little
trouble with your complexion 
i m joking  of course 
a troubled conscience 
a little blood on your hands
from what you consider justice 
justice 
you and i know it s just
another word for what i do 
we should be
working together 
i could use
a man like you 
that s why
i brought you up here 
you can make a lot of
money working for me 
but if you still want her 
i ll throw in julie  sound good 
oops 
pey   
bitch 
peyton 
there you go 
julie 
peyton 
come on 
you re going down 
burn head 
oh  no 
help me 
in your absence  i ve gotten to
know julie quite intimately 
her tastes are varied 
but i can tell you this 
she doesn t date freaks 
peyton 
oh 
oh 
julie 
go ahead  do it 
do it  westlake 
but think of this 
you let me die  and you
become as bad as me  worse 
you can t 
i know you too well 
dropping me is not really
an option for you 
it s not something
you could live with 
i m learning to live
with a lot of things 
don t look at me 
i want to look 
you ll perfect the skin  you ll make
it work  it doesn t matter 
julie 
don t you think i told myself that 
night after sleepless night 
it s just a burn  skin deep 
it doesn t matter 
and if i covered it 
hid behind a mask 
you could love me
for who i was inside 
without pity 
but a funny thing happened 
as i worked on the mask  i found
the man inside was changing 
he became wrong 
a monster 
i could live with it now 
but nobody else can 
i want our life back 
peyton 
peyton 
peyton is gone 
peyt 
hey 
i m everyone
