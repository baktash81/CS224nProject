herb gorson please
here you go babe
peyton
oops sorry
hello
herb hi
its julie hastings
listen i found some memos when i was
researching the von hoffenstein deal
that i dont think
i was supposed to find
yeah
what are they
theyre from strack to a guy
named claude bellasarious
and theyre records of payments to
various people on the zoning commission
well i think
theyre payoffs
if its an accusation
you better be sure
yeah well what i want to
do is talk to strack first
give him the benefit
of the doubt
yeah okay
call me
all right ill talk
to you later herb bye
bye herb
oh i dont want to go
dont go
dont go
i have to go
stay stay
i have to go now i have to go now
im late
julie
ill call you later
julie
julie wait
what is it
ive been thinking
we should get married
marriage
uhhuh
uhhuh
ive just started getting
things going at the firm
and i really like
having my own place
but were practically
living together now
all marriage means is you answer
the phone in the morning
and if its my grandmother you dont
pretend its the wrong number
the poor womans beginning to
think she has alzheimers
i cant talk
about it now
come here
jules im asking you
to marry me
peyt i love you
i mean
i realized
but i got to
think it over okay
mr strack ive been
going over some documents
and ive come across
something that puzzles me
its a memo from your office
to a mr claude bellasarious
it details
certain payments that
yes yes
i know the memo
well it seems
like the payments were
were payoffs
to the zoning commission
bribes
to call a spade a spade
does that shock you
no i guessed as much
you werent supposed to know about it
that file was not supposed to circulate
however i am asking you
to understand
take a look
at that model julie
thats the dream
acres of riverfront
reclaimed from decay
thousands of jobs created
a building block a very large
building block laid for the future
not such a bad dream
as dreams go
and if the price of realizing that dream
is the occasional distasteful chore
well i dont run away
i say so be it
so
want to book me
the fact remains that im in possession
of evidence of the commission of a crime
well let me suggest this you
excuse yourself for a few minutes
go to the ladies room
leaving your briefcase here
what happens to that memorandum
while its in my custody
is my responsibility
i wish it were that simple but first
of all i dont have the memo with me
im trying to protect you
does the name robert durant
mean anything to you
drugs racketeering
and real estate
robert durant is a competitor
for the riverfront
hes a very dangerous
man julie
and i fully believe hed do anything
to get his hands on that document
dna content acceptable
glucose right on
weve even checked the collagen congeners
theyre fine
this is unbelievable every day
its a different combination
time yakitito
time
ninetyeight minutes
oh the circuit again
ill fix it
i knew we were pulling
too much juice on that line
yakitito time
huh
time
ninetynine
one hundred minutes
what what
the cells theyre holding
theyre stable
but dr westlake
why now
the dark
oh of course
the dark
i think the synthetic cells
are photosensitive
this is unbelievable
what is it about
the dark
what secret does it hold
theyre still stable
time yakitito time
101 minutes
finally we can replace
damaged skin tissue
no yakitito no not quite my friend
not yet
all weve got is a piece of the puzzle
theres still the big question
how to keep the cells stable
past 99 minutes in the light
but at least now we know
its all about light
ill get it
no foolish heroics
if you please
weve come
only for documents
tell us where to find
the bellasarious memorandum
and we shall disappear like a
nightmare before the breaking day
i dont know
what youre talking about
how unfortunate
what memorandum
no please
we want the memorandum
should your houseboys
predicament not jog your memory
you may bid him godspeed
hes a lab assistant for
gods sakes let him breathe
you heard the doctor
ventilate him
no no
bingo
goody
bring the asians fingers
gentlemen
rick im proud of you
clean through the brain
thats how i like it
marry me
didnt see you doing
much work out there
that guy got blown to pieces
all they found was an ear
tiny little piece didnt
take me long to bury that
youll be all right
youll be all right
im gonna
need some sponges
okay
you got them
great well get ready
to move him
lets check
the eyes
get a gurney in here
right there
straight in
next we have a 30 35yearold
male no id no medical history
he was found on the riverbank
just south of the city
theres a sizeable population of
homeless and indigents there
we get at least three
nonames like him every week
nobody does anything
about the homeless
until they become train wrecks
like mr john doe here
hes got burns covering
over 40 of his body
the hands and face
are the most severe
ten years ago pain from the burns
would have been intolerable
this man would have spent the
rest of his life screaming
now we use
the rangeberitz technique
quite simply we sever the nerves
within the spinothalamic tract there
which as you know
transmits neural impulses
of pain and vibratory sense
to the brain
no longer receiving
impulses of pain
you stick him with a pin
ouch
and he cant even
feel it
as in many
radical procedures
there are serious side
effects to this operation
when the body ceases to feel when
so much sensory input is lost
the mind grows hungry
starved of its regular diet of input it
takes the only remaining stimulation it has
the emotions
and amplifies them
giving rise to
alienation and loneliness
uncontrolled rage
is not uncommon
now surges of adrenaline flow
unchecked through the body and brain
giving him augmented strength
hence the restraints
naturally we give them
every chance of recovery
remain optimistic
inspire confidence
talk to him about
rehabilitation potential
personally i give him
a nine on the buzzard scale
code blue burn unit

this further strain
you burned peytons lab
not me personally

for me unofficially off the books
robert doesnt like
to pay taxes
and now youll kill me
hardly
you have
nothing on me
youd find the extremely expensive
police department quite unsympathetic
julie consider
the big picture
consider what
were building here
you and i were
building a city
we cant let anything
get in the way of that
despite the way
things might appear
you cant pretend that certain
moments havent passed between us
we still have that
if youre not
going to kill me
i have things to do
i suppose
this is goodbye then
send robert in
yes mr strack
robert i have
good news and bad
custom dictates that you
render the bad news first
we have a little problem
with miss hastings
it appears she has
uncovered our alliance
no problem at all
and the good news
your wife died
im joking of course
no the good news is that i know whos
behind our little troubles of late
when you retrieved my memorandum you
failed to excise the good doctor

i dont think the world will
grieve over one less attorney
its the tragedy of my life
that i have to kill the ones i love
my wife late wife
held certain deeds
i sent her on a plane trip
over the smokies
lets just say
i landed on my feet
im glad you survived
robert
id hate to see your kids
deprived of a role model
they do look up to me
when i was young
my father made me
work high steel
just me and the indians
no one else crazy enough to run
around up here against the wind
450 an hour
call me crazy
sometimes i miss it
life on the edge
five inches wide
650 feet down
high steel
oh by the way you dont
have any kids robert
you truly are
one ugly son of a bitch
what do you think julie
whos the real monster here
i destroy to build
something better
whereas you youre a man
who destroys for revenge
look
look about you
its all mine
because i built it
i built it all
what have you got besides a little
trouble with your complexion
im joking of course
a troubled conscience
a little blood on your hands
from what you consider justice
justice
you and i know its just
another word for what i do
we should be
working together
i could use
a man like you
thats why
i brought you up here
you can make a lot of
money working for me
but if you still want her
ill throw in julie sound good
oops
pey
bitch
peyton
there you go
julie
peyton
come on
youre going down
burn head

in your absence ive gotten to
know julie quite intimately
her tastes are varied
but i can tell you this
she doesnt date freaks
peyton
oh
oh
julie
go ahead do it
do it westlake
but think of this
you let me die and you
become as bad as me worse
you cant
i know you too well
dropping me is not really
an option for you
its not something
you could live with
im learning to live
with a lot of things
dont look at me
i want to look
youll perfect the skin youll make
it work it doesnt matter
julie
dont you think i told myself that
night after sleepless night
its just a burn skindeep
it doesnt matter
and if i covered it
hid behind a mask
you could love me
for who i was inside
without pity
but a funny thing happened
as i worked on the mask i found
the man inside was changing
he became wrong
a monster
i could live with it now
but nobody else can
i want our life back
peyton
peyton
peyton is gone
peyt
hey
im everyone
