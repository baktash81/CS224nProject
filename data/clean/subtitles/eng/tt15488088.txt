  i am 
  you always had big ideas 
but very little follow through 
not true 
oh  what about the time you were gonna
go out in the middle of the night
and paint a vagina
on that fraternity house 
i don t remember that 
you talked about it for weeks 
you were gonna do it for homecoming 
no kidding  what happened 
nothing  nothing happened 
you never did it 
or what about the time you were gonna
become a lounge singer 
or drive down to peru 
there s still time 
  are you still playing 
   course i m still playing 
without my cello  i d be lost 
completely lost 
  well  good for you 
  mm 
i m not with the orchestra anymore 
i m with a couple of ensembles 
one is devoted totally
to modern composers 
and the other is all bach 
do do you still have
that cute little house 
  mm hmm 
  oh  that s wonderful  wonderful 
um  so i was wondering   
if if you could help me 
what  murder him 
there s a little thing called jail 
nice place to visit 
but you wouldn t want to live there 
and let s take a moment to remember
our beautiful  kind  happy friend
whose funeral we attended today 
i ve thought about her 
i prioritized her happiness over mine 
over my my sanity 
she never asked you to do anything 
and i told you 
i told you to go the police 
yeah  you did 
they wouldn t have believed me 
i mean  back then 
 why were you alone in that house 
you knew your friend was out of town  
 why were you alone
in your best friend s house
with her husband  
mm   best friend   i thought
i was your best friend at that time 
you were both my best friends 
i m just yankin  your chain 
it would ve ruined her life
if  had told the police 
we ll never know 
her life might ve been better 
what s the plan 
i m gonna shoot him 
i m gonna buy a gun
and i m gonna take it to the wake 
  mm hmm 
  you wanna come with me 
sure  scarface  sounds like fun 
oh 
uh  hello 
  hello 
  i i d like to buy a handgun 
  mm hmm 
  um  something not to heavy  please 
  and maybe a silencer 
  hm 
well  i can t sell you a silencer 
you can t legally buy
a suppressor in california 
  tsk 
  oh 
you can wear earplugs 
well  what kind of firearm
would you recommend for me 
i want something that s    light 
well  what re you gonna use it for 
tell  im 
sport shooting  self defense 
yea    self defense 
okay  well  how about
this little davis derringer 
fits right in your pocket 
or your pocketbook 
right next to your keys 
  oh  it s cute 
  very 
 22 caliber  two shots 
nice backup piece 
wanna hold it 
  oh  sure 
  it s used  costs about  125 
  it s light 
  how s the recoil 
recoil 
um  not gonna lie  it has a little kick 
not much there to absorb the shock 
do you have arthritis
in your wrists and hands 
a little bit in my in my left wrist 
but i take medication 
hips are my problem 
mine too  i got
a hip replacement last year 
oh  how d that go for you 
pretty good  thanks 
i also recommend this beretta 92 
looks heavier 
it has very little recoil 
very smooth  feels like a cadillac 
i think that the key here is
to use a load that lessens the kick 
these  9mm bullets are very lightweight 
hollow point for maximum damage 
oh  maximum damage sounds neat 
yeah  i ll take    i ll take
the smaller gun 
um  okay  i ll need your california
driver slicense or your cal id 
and you can take the handgun safety test
right here in the store 
i don t have a california license 
  you don t have california license 
  no  i live in ohio 
then i can t
sell you a gun  sorry 
well  darn it  we tried 
so  did you get that out of your system 
the whole dirty harry 
death wishthing 
no  i didn t get it out of my system 
god 
i should ve bought
a gun at home and brought it 
couldn t have gotten it
on the plane 
oh  claire  it s been decades 
and not like a couple of decades 
it s been four and a half decades

i know my mother   
my mother would be    so happy
to see you all here 
she d really appreciate 
i know dad and i do 
so please eat  drink 
and raise a toast to my mom 
the best mom in the world 
to joyce 
yes 
  um  i have a few words to say 
  please 
uh  this is evelyn 
one of my mother s oldest friends 
joyce was a wonderful woman 
she certainly was 
a great cook 
a devoted wife and mother 
a doting grandmother 
and forjunior
and senior years in college 
and then six months in new york city
after graduation 
she was my roommate and my lover 
jesus  what 
and this wasn t
a  gay until graduation  type of thing 
this was who she was 
but not who she wanted to be 
god 
i m sorry  howard  what s so funny 
you are  evelyn  you always had
such a great sense of humor 
mm  not really 
people think i m being funny 
but i m really just talking 
it s very inappropriate 
evelyn  and untrue 
and not something my children
needed to hear 
oh  was it 
did you even understand
what i was saying  honey 
you said you loved grandma 
that s right 
that s exactly what i said 
adorable grandkids 
she got that in the transaction  i guess 
she told me 
she told me that you were delusional 
that you were infatuated with her 
i mean  we used to laugh about it 
she thought you were funny 
i can tell you that 
she told me you were cruel 
my father is one
of the kindest people i know 
oh  is he 
i think you should leave now 
i tend to agree 
howard  you didn t deserve her 
um  can anyone give me a ride 
so  what did you think of my big news 
i knew 
two of you were always staring
at each other 
mooning over each other 
so why didn t you say something 
why didn t you 
joyce didn t want to 
guess i didn t either at the time 
  it was a different time 
  no 
you have always underestimated me 
here  pull over  here  at the bus stop 
what gives  i can drive you home 
what re you afraid of 
hey 
ta da 
why    why did you lie to me 
why why did you say
you still had your house 
well  if you thought i still had my house 
then for a moment there
it was as if i still had my house 
yeah  makes sense 
not really 
it just got too much to keep up 
i i spent a fortune on plumbing 
the roof   
i didn t have the money anymore 
  i love these chairs 
  aren t they good 
but didn t you get a great pension
from the orchestra 
well  i have a modest pension 
enough to pay for this place 
i m in the independent living section 
  so i come and go as i want 
  right 
for rehearsals and concerts and   
oh  yeah 
sorry 
arthritis  tendonitis  bursitis 
my ankles are in good shape  though 
i still teach  from time to time 
i do a master class  occasionally 
one of my old students
teaches nearby 
she has me come in 
critique the sawing 
  oh 
  she throws me a few bucks 
and the meals are included here 
i like eating cardboard

after all this time
to have one less mystery in my life 
did you meet someone 
  meet someone 
  a man 
did you fall in love with someone else 
no  no 
well  that s a relief 
i guess 
i mean  i thought maybe   
if if i was to be honest 
i thought perhaps it was the old story 
what old story 
that i m black and you re white 
and what 
and i just suddenly realized that 
maybe your father got to you 
oh  ralph

they think it could ve been
an anxiety attack  possibly an ulcer 
they don t know  they re keeping him
overnight to make sure 
so he s not gonna die 
well  they re still running tests 
but they think he s out of danger now 
they say it s really good
that he came in 
he s been under a tremendous
amount of stress 
oh  stress is a killer 
a slow one  evidently 
you think i could see him

and she asked me if i wouldn t mind
dropping food off for you 
she said that   
you couldn t be relied on
to feed yourself 
and she was worried about you 
she said you d been drinking a lot 
it was a mistake 
whatever happened between us   
  it was a mistake 
  it was a mistake 
that you grabbed my breasts so hard 
they hurt for a week 
that you put your leg behind my leg
and tripped me down to the floor 
and then lay on top of me   
and pulled out your penis   
put your hands on my throat 
and said if i screamed 
you d choke me 
then you pressed
my face into the floor 
and you pulled up my skirt
and you shoved it in me 
i would never force myself on anyone 
i would never do that 
you wanted it 
you were always looking at me 
i would catch you    staring 
you had troubles
in your own marriage
