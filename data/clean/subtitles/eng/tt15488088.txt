this weekend

you always had big ideas
but very little followthrough
not true
oh what about the time you were gonna
go out in the middle of the night
and paint a vagina
on that fraternity house
i dont remember that
you talked about it for weeks
you were gonna do it for homecoming
no kidding what happened
nothing nothing happened
you never did it
or what about the time you were gonna
become a lounge singer
or drive down to peru
theres still time
are you still playing
course im still playing
without my cello id be lost
completely lost
well good for you
mm
im not with the orchestra anymore
im with a couple of ensembles
one is devoted totally
to modern composers
and the other is all bach
dodo you still have
that cute little house
mmhmm
oh thats wonderful wonderful
um so i was wondering
ifif you could help me
what murder him
theres a little thing called jail
nice place to visit
but you wouldnt want to live there
and lets take a moment to remember
our beautiful kind happy friend
whose funeral we attended today
ive thought about her
i prioritized her happiness over mine
over mymy sanity
she never asked you to do anything
and i told you
i told you to go the police
yeah you did
they wouldnt have believed me
i mean back then
why were you alone in that house
you knew your friend was out of town
why were you alone
in your best friends house
with her husband
mm best friend i thought
i was your best friend at that time
you were both my best friends
im just yankin your chain
it wouldve ruined her life
if had told the police
well never know
her life mightve been better
whats the plan
im gonna shoot him
im gonna buy a gun
and im gonna take it to the wake
mmhmm
you wanna come with me
sure scarface sounds like fun
oh
uh hello
hello
iid like to buy a handgun
mmhmm
um something not to heavy please
and maybe a silencer
hm
well i cant sell you a silencer
you cant legally buy
a suppressor in california
tsk
oh
you can wear earplugs
well what kind of firearm
would you recommend for me
i want something thats light
well whatre you gonna use it for
tell im
sport shooting self defense
yea self defense
okay well how about
this little davis derringer
fits right in your pocket
or your pocketbook
right next to your keys
oh its cute
very
22 caliber two shots
nice backup piece
wanna hold it
oh sure
its used costs about 125
its light
hows the recoil
recoil
um not gonna lie it has a little kick
not much there to absorb the shock
do you have arthritis
in your wrists and hands
a little bit in myin my left wrist
but i take medication
hips are my problem
mine too i got
a hip replacement last year
oh howd that go for you
pretty good thanks
i also recommend this beretta 92
looks heavier
it has very little recoil
very smooth feels like a cadillac
i think that the key here is
to use a load that lessens the kick
these 9mm bullets are very lightweight
hollow point for maximum damage
oh maximum damage sounds neat
yeah ill take ill take
the smaller gun
um okay ill need your california
driverslicense or your cal id
and you can take the handgun safety test
right here in the store
i dont have a california license
you dont have california license
no i live in ohio
then i cant
sell you a gun sorry
well darn it we tried
so did you get that out of your system
the whole dirty harry
death wishthing
no i didnt get it out of my system
god
i shouldve bought
a gun at home and brought it
couldnt have gotten it
on the plane
oh claire its been decades
and not like a couple of decades
its been four and a half decades

the necklace joyce was wearing
in the photo at the funeral home

to see you all here
shed really appreciate
i know dad and i do
so please eat drink
and raise a toast to my mom
the best mom in the world
to joyce
yes
um i have a few words to say
please
uh this is evelyn
one of my mothers oldest friends
joyce was a wonderful woman
she certainly was
a great cook
a devoted wife and mother
a doting grandmother
and forjunior
and senior years in college
and then six months in new york city
after graduation
she was my roommate and my lover
jesus what
and this wasnt
a gay until graduation type of thing
this was who she was
but not who she wanted to be
god
im sorry howard whats so funny
you are evelyn you always had
such a great sense of humor
mm not really
people think im being funny
but im really just talking
its very inappropriate
evelyn and untrue
and not something my children
needed to hear
oh was it
did you even understand
what i was saying honey
you said you loved grandma
thats right
thats exactly what i said
adorable grandkids
she got that in the transaction i guess
she told me
she told me that you were delusional
that you were infatuated with her
i mean we used to laugh about it
she thought you were funny
i can tell you that
she told me you were cruel
my father is one
of the kindest people i know
oh is he
i think you should leave now
i tend to agree
howard you didnt deserve her
um can anyone give me a ride
so what did you think of my big news
i knew
two of you were always staring
at each other
mooning over each other
so why didnt you say something
why didnt you
joyce didnt want to
guess i didnt either at the time
it was a different time
no
you have always underestimated me
here pull over here at the bus stop
what gives i can drive you home
whatre you afraid of
hey
tada
why why did you lie to me
whywhy did you say
you still had your house
well if you thought i still had my house
then for a moment there
it was as if i still had my house
yeah makes sense
not really
it just got too much to keep up
ii spent a fortune on plumbing
the roof
i didnt have the money anymore
i love these chairs
arent they good
but didnt you get a great pension
from the orchestra
well i have a modest pension
enough to pay for this place

they think it couldve been
an anxiety attack possibly an ulcer

overnight to make sure
so hes not gonna die
well theyre still running tests

they say its really good
that he came in
hes been under a tremendous
amount of stress

nurse
joyce was away
visiting her mother who was sick
and she asked me if i wouldnt mind
dropping food off for you
she said that
you couldnt be relied on
to feed yourself
and she was worried about you
she said youd been drinking a lot
it was a mistake
whatever happened between us
it was a mistake
it was a mistake
that you grabbed my breasts so hard
they hurt for a week
that you put your leg behind my leg
and tripped me down to the floor
and then lay on top of me
and pulled out your penis
put your hands on my throat
and said if i screamed
youd choke me
then you pressed
my face into the floor
and you pulled up my skirt
and you shoved it in me
i would never force myself on anyone
i would never do that
you wanted it
you were always looking at me
i would catch you staring
you had troubles
in your own marriage
