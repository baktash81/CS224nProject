i received a letter from mr murray
he is coming to downton on tuesday
why did you call him
i didnt
it was his grandmother who called him
he wants us there
rosamund you should come with us
my goodness
why do you say that
there is only one reason for ladies
call their lawyers
sit down
i feel like the andromeda
chained to a rock
with you hovering over me
i dont know why murray
called them without asking me
neither do we
denker
mr murray will be here soon
he has arrived milady
he said that the lady
is waiting for him
what why didnt you tell me
you shouldnt be
so suspicious
you told them
lady grantham good
please
she didnt say anything
well thats easy to tell
i took possession of a mansion
in the south of france
and now i have given the mansion
to my greatgranddaughter sybbie
what
which part dont you understand
i didnt understand any part of it
what mansion where
this is too extraordinary
to talk about
it is la villa des colombes
and its near toulon
but why is it yours
and why did
did you never talk about it
because i thought it was a joke
start at the beginning
years ago
before you were born
i was in france
and i met a man
the marquis of montmirail
and he invited me
to spend some time
in the mansion
that he had just bought
about a year later
he sent me a letter
and said that he had
transferred the mansion
for my name
i never thought it was serious
so i didnt pay attention
but wasnt it a joke
i guess not
he died recently
and to the widows dismay
the mansion they have used
in winter for years
was registered in the name
of lady grantham
he never changed
now i need signatures
of course
why did you give the mansion
to sybbie
your children are
well established here
and edith is
more than well taken care of
but brompton will be a son
of tom and lucy
so sybils only daughter
will inherit little
and i wanted to correct this
what family does he have
this man montmirail
the widow and a son
the present marquis
the mother is interested in taking
the matter to court
you cant blame her
why not
if her husband wanted
the place to be mine
why should we argue
have you never thought of refusing
do i look like im turning down
a mansion in the south of france
mr murray
may i ask you a favor
please
i have an assignment for you
everything is explained in this letter
i will call you in a few days
to clarify doubts
of course lady grantham
now i hear my train calling
goodbye mr murray
and thank you
you want me to tell you
why he did it
but the truth is i dont know
and so i will say good night
and let them argue
about my mysterious past
denker dont lead me on
i am not a car
unfortunately
i ask for forgiveness
really should try it
that sounds strange
they spend a few days
at the same resort
for more than 60 years
and he gives her a house
i suppose he was not
just a lunatic
that is what they will try to prove
i think its admirable of grandma
to want to take care of sybbie
even though mr montmirail
is a stonecold madman
but why did mama
never commented
as far as she knows she received
a very eccentric letter
for more than half a century
you thought it was a waste of time
at the moment
and never thought about it again
very good marigold
go ahead
i find it amazing that they have
thats right good move
stay back
grandma look
a call for you
who is it
a mr barber
its from british lion
what is it
its a film production company isnt it
id better find out
what he wants
what are you going to do with the mansion
in the summer
they cant go
nobody goes there in the summer
now go
it sure is hot
apparently not
mommy
hi sweetheart
mommy come and play
its a race come on hurry up
good deeds
mr barber became
a producer and director
he wants to practice
chronophotography here
its not the stone age
dad
he wants to make
a film on downton
what did you say
i declined gently
ill call back
i want to hear his offer
for what
i suppose there will be a payment
when will henry be back
there is no time for that
where is he now
his last message came
from istanbul or somewhere else
but as far as im concerned
the rally idea is noisy
you can manage without it
got it
so its up to me right
dont expect us to deal
with movie people
first lets hear
his proposal
come mary
ill keep you company
the money will be useful thats for sure
is everything okay with henry
he is passionate about cars
passionate about speed
passionate about adventure
besides being in love
with me i guess
but i dont nullify the other three
and you thought you would
i guess i did
ready for you
it is perfect
until recently cinema
was confined to the studios
but now
this process is changing
napoléon by abel gance
last year
showed what a camera
does on location
filming in a house
in real landscapes
what kind of film
the gambleris made in 1875
the daughter of an earl
lady anne erskine
fell in love with a man
who was a gambler
to the horror of the family
i can imagine
they meet
in a country house
and things get out of hand
there are visitors at a gaming club
which would be here
a gambling club in downton
that would end up with grandma
and with daddy too
we need to think
of course
here is my card
call me at
if you have any questions
barrow will accompany you
i believe that there are questions
that need answers
before we actually discuss
we would stay here
about a month
and if you turn the card over
you will see how much we will pay
of course this is negotiable
goodbye mr barber
goodbye mr barber
and thats just for starters
i think its a horrible idea
highly makeup actresses
and plastered actors
messing up our stuff
we would continue to count
the spoons
the locals would
with bad eyes
you must not let
it stop you
the county takes a dim view
of everything
you should consider the money
we dont need to
talk about money
but you need to think about it
we can have a new roof
soon we will have real floods
and then what
if you refuse
do you think we can convince them
driving further north
to bancaster
mom what do you think
mary dear would you take your father
to see the attics
i dont believe
that he has visited recently
i havent been here in years
well this is our
current situation
with the money we can
put the house in order
balancing what we spend
on the property
and enter the 1930s
with our heads held high
but if you dont want to
no
no you will command
you are the captain now
i am aware of that
even if i think otherwise
and now i have
the unenviable task
to break the news to mr carson
i dont believe it
making a movie here
can they do that
will it be a movie with stars
celebrities
give him some water before he passes out
there is nothing decided yet
its okay to get excited
you live on the farm
the rest of us will come and go
around every hour
that god gives us
and what about his lordship
hoping for a peaceful end
and suddenly he plunged
into a threering circus
well i agree with daisy
we will meet men and women
that we only see on the screen
it will be good for home
thats the thing
this money will make a difference
how much did they say
its none of your business
if they talked
they didnt speak
well good night
good evening
good night
still times change
and we must change with them
mrs parker
we should go home too
very good mr parker
lets go
daisy is more obedient
with him than with me
maybe he will make her happier
well i did my best
a movie in downton
i know it seems unlikely
but im not sure
if it is that horrible
i disagree
rude and vulgar actors
and actresses
walking through the rooms
with his sticky fingers
sitting on the chairs
eating at the table where once
sat the king of england
this smacks of the worst excesses
of the french revolution
should we ask them to stand
stand and put gloves on them
this is a fall elsie
its a fall
they are flirting
with the mafia
but it will pay charlie
and they need the money
with this argument why
not open the place to the public
and have them poking and prodding
and poking around every corner
we tried this once
and i thought we had all
decided never again
keep this up
and you will have a heart attack
i would be better off out of it
if thats what its come to
andy could you fold
this newspaper straight
i will take him with me upstairs
of course
then a film will be made
in the big house
what will this mean
for you
i cant say for sure
but it will be exciting
see how a movie is made
meet the stars
i would stay away from them
if i were you
i would stay away from everything
ill say good night then
good evening
good night
i forgot the newspaper
after all
memory of a mosquito
good evening
remember its his farm
not ours
its lord granthams
hes just the tenant
maybe but dont say anything
that you will regret
this is the problem
and in the end where will we be
murray requested a translation
of the will
apparently montmirail
talks about an idyllic interlude
he spent with his mother
before getting married
and what else does murray have to say
its strange
the widow wants to fight
for the will
but the son thinks he can
make an amicable agreement
i would wire the mansion
and seal the windows
he wants us to visit him there
mom cant travel
but asked to take
tom and lucy with us
now that he knows that sybbie
must be the beneficiary
what do you think
good
we could get to know
lucy better
with luck it means
we would lose
this whole terrible film
of marys
i found it myrna dalgleish
i knew i had one of her own
her beauty is so classic
i have one of his
guy dexter in casanova
just the thought makes me red
he has something special
like an animal
ready to jump
jump on you you say
thats enough andy and i will be
jealous if you dont take care of yourself
i like that
i hate to know that you will miss
all the fun
i am nervous now about leaving
you alone with guy dexter
the chances would be good
what do you think bertie
a complication
tom says they need to
bring maud bagshaw
she is with them
until her house is ready
we can stay in a hotel
in that case can we go
i would love to
wouldnt we get in the way
everyone goes except me
i am
i will do an article about people
who visit the south of france
in the summer
are you writing again
thats great
edith returned to the magazine
two days a week
what about little peter
she has a wonderful nanny
thank god
can you really work
with two children
and take care of a house
like brancaster
ask me in six months
i am happy to know that you are
using your mind again
we hope it is still there
i will call montmirail tomorrow
to say that we will be
at the hotel
i think he will be relieved
come in
i saw that the lights were still on
were still on
i suppose you agree with dad
that the idea of the film
is too banal
to be taken into consideration
nothing is so banal if it will serve
to keep downton going
we will have money
to redo the roof
at the cost of a terrible month
frankly i believe
that it will be very terrible
but seeing those buckets
collecting rainwater in the attic
is also terrible
we went through the war
we will go through it too
but you must be firm mary
for these people women
like us have two categories
dragons and fools
you have to make sure that they will see you
as a dragon
mr bates and mrs baxter will take care of
of lord and lady grantham
the rest will stay at downton
to help the people in the film
i wont help anyone
unlike
of ms nofairyness
i would love to help
may i be mrs dalgleishs
of mrs dalgleishs company
i asked anna to do that
i dont mean to be a pain daisy
but your job is here
do we know if mrs dalgleish
will stay in the house
yes it will stay with the director
and the protagonist
the rest will stay in the mansion
now i have to go
to see lady mary
dont worry daisy
anna will find a way
to get you there
i would trade it all in for a trip
to the south of france
daisy
i believe he
is opposed milady
and says that you must observe
and keep them under control
i dont know if it will be of much help
we need to get rid of it
but how
should i travel to france
with the others
really
she is worried that everything
is foreign to your lordship
and neither mr bates
or mrs baxter
will have the authority to make sure
that everything is done right
yes i understand
your lordship needs
you charlie
only you can show them
how things should be done
dont worry about it
they had better be warned
the british are coming
but what would i do with it
and wouldnt it be an imposition
on the montmirails
he wants to be useful to you
papa as he always has
i could not show him
that he is of great help
just by being there
i will since you insist
but it seems too
sentimental to me
wait right here
right go after him
british lion
cinematografia ltda
you two come on pull
follow the closet maam
give it to me
it will show you where to take it
no thats private
i understand
over here here it is
excuse me sir
yes please thats it
you are an angel
hello mr molesley
why are you here
you know i love everything
that has to do with movies
i know you like to go to the movies
it is more than that
for me hollywood is
the real dream factory
and i need dreams
as much as any man
all this for one woman
this is the closet
of mrs dalgleish
i know its so elegant
no do it the right way
sorry
nice and easy guys
continue put it there
thank you very much here you go
look where you tread
you are here hiding
from the invaders
sybbie hello dear
what a pleasant surprise
she came to stay with her cousins
while we are in france
we talk about you
about me grandpa why
for numerous reasons all good
i present to you
miss dalgleish
my father lord grantham
she is one of the stars
of our film
i believe easily
welcome to downton
miss dalgleish
the modern world comes to downton
did you tell our host
that we will stay in a hotel
he would not listen he insists
to stay in the mansion
even going to steal it
he seems like a very nice guy
and has impeccable english
which is more than can
be said of my french
mr guy dexter
welcome mr dexter
i am lord grantham
this is my daughter
lady mary talbot
she will take care of you
since we are going to the riviera
but i hope you have fun here
i would go with you if i could
are you english
yes
i went to america ten years ago
to try my luck
and ive been there ever since
i am not the only one
they call us
the hollywood raj
we play cricket
cricket once a week
and the weather never stops playing
do you know the south of france
the last time there i was left
on the roof of the negresco
with ronald colman
and gloria swanson
on the roof
you can tell us at dinner
when will they go
tomorrow
dover calais
and then the blue train to nice
that sounds enviable
when will your director arrive
he will come for dinner
dont you think so myrna
how would i know
myrna dalgleish in this house
its amazing
her father sold fruit
at the borough market
now look at her
a goddess of the screen
and you will be her servant
she brought
a mountain of luggage
i thought that you and anna might
offer to unpack
remember you dont know
this woman
she may not be the movie star
you see in the magazines
well there is only one way
to find out
thank you
lady grantham
i am sorry to bother you
not at all
i made a new will
and i need you to witness
my signature
i am exaggerating its just my
my jewelry and other pieces
its always a good idea to
to update these things
murray was already down
i thought i would take advantage of that
im glad you came
because i wanted to tell you
that violet asked us
to look through her things
what why did she ask you
i have no idea but of course
that anything of interest
will be forwarded
to robert and you
i just thought
you should know
well she wants to have her death
orderly and hasslefree
it has a lot to do with her
is it wrong to go to france
certainly not
mary can send a telegram
if there is anything strange
but there wont be
i wont pretend that ive always loved her
but it will be strange
and mary will be missed
when she is gone
mary will become her
then the gap will be filled
now i have to go
dinner is late
for being here
see you when we get back
of course
she is right it will be strange
i will miss an opponent
to keep me in shape
be careful with the clothes
they are couture
i need to help lady mary
and lady hexham to get dressed
then ill let daisy
unpacking
i will come back when i am
dinner
as long as you finish
and the trunks are already in the room
what were you doing
on the roof of negresco
it was a treasure hunt
and it needed a chimney
but when we got there
they were big
so we crushed and brought
all the pieces
was the manager satisfied
well it was good publicity
is there such a thing as good publicity
it exists if you are in the movies
i suppose the russians
break their glasses
as a sign of good luck
and now famous people break
other peoples property
for good advertising
is it true
miss dalgleish
i dont do anything
unless i want to
how great that sounds
move the plate closer
how did you become a movie actress
a talent scout
discovered me
because i am very beautiful
it sounds wonderfully
romantic
well its not so romantic
not when you know that every man in the room
in the room wants you
what a joyful life you lead
have you made many films
traveling around the country
im afraid im quite happy
to lose that
i know you do it
just for the money but thats okay
what i never understand
is how you remember the lines
well its not theater
in fact i dont even know
if the performance is adequate
but wont that change
havent the movies started
to be talked about
a few words here and there
nothing scary
who says
bring me a crème de menthe
would it be possible to remember
miss dalgleish
that the servants work
hard in this house
and are doing their best
they are not used
to rudeness
she is not used to criticism
your face on the screen sells
millions of tickets
and she knows it
i understood
i took my first picture
when i was 20
thank you
i am the butler sir
please
let me know if you need anything
anything you need
it seems like a very difficult task
im sorry
im teasing you
what i must say is
i have everything i need
thank you very much
very good sir
put that book away
charlie and go to sleep
let me finish this chapter
you dont believe
what these people eat
pardon
come on carson
coming through
lets run
before things get worse
i hope you have
a mediterranean version
of this outfit or it will bake
dont worry about me my lord
youll be fine wont you
bye daddy
take care of teo
of course
have a great day
no matter how it will be
yes we will do our best
now dont give me
with any scratches
i found out
in dealing with foreigners
if someone speaks loudly and slowly
will bend to your will
not too loud and not too slow
no no andrew
andrew no no
thank you bates
we came to wish you good luck
well they just caught us
as we set off
on our strange mission
good
what a pity that you will miss
the footage
will you watch
while i am away
i will try if you let me
try to have fun
i dont need to say
the same for you
please make johnnie
keep his nose clean
it will be done sir
all aboard
or we will miss the train
dont think ive seen
so many beautiful ladies
tea for miss dalgleish
i just did
daisy can take it
i will take it i want to take it
no let me take it please
lady mary wont mind
i beg you
calm down daisy
but i will get the tray later
this one is for you
miss dalgleish
i never told you how exciting
to see you here
i love your movies
you are an inspiration to me
since i watched
starcrossed
can we move on
now
everyone in the positions
is she the actress
roll the camera
harry
e action
you come down the stairs
and find him with your eyes
you stop and move on
but he is still waiting for you
tell her she looks beautiful
he is happy to hear that
but you dont admit it
look into his eyes
will you let him kiss you
it looks like you will
wait wait who is he
cut cut cut
i am sorry
wait i cant act like this
its molesley
he is very much appreciated here
does it matter if he watches
of course they dont mind
they just dont want him there
no well noted
so now you will do it all over again
exactly
id rather make a living
on a mine
first positions please
rotate the camera
harry
and action
go down the stairs
surprised to find him there
if i had known that we were going to stay
in the mansion i dont know if i would come
why not
dont you think it might be
a little strange
when we take ownership
the home of this family
i dont know if this is the
sensible way to look at it
i am glad that sybbie will be
in a similar situation as her cousins
violet is giving her granddaughter away
a great opportunity
a real start in life
her generosity
surprised you
attila the hun
loved his family
are you all right mr carson
well is not the first thing
that comes to my mind
i brought you a piece of cake
mr carson
i think she sounded very rude
i hope she is finished
it is very difficult when
every film depends on you
it depends on mr dexter too
and he seems
much better to handle
and it is so attractive
hi hi
are you up to something
if i were
would i tell you
mr molesley
is in the movie now
i didnt know where to stay
lets leave the movie people
with their work
and we with ours
listen to him daisy before you run away
to join the circus
how are we all doing
how do we survive
right
those cliffs
were pretty steep werent they
well shall we
monsieur de montmirail
lord grantham bienvenu
well we came in a caravan
we even brought our butler
i dont know why
but how chic
now come on in everybody

mr mason
how are you doing
are you going back to the farm
i wanted to give the
to the young couple
they are never left alone
they always have to put up with me
well it is your home
but i want them to feel
that it is their home
so that when i hand over
the rent they take over
what are you going to do
dont worry about me
you already have your worries
i care about you
thank you
the schedules for tomorrow
will be issued within one hour
and delivered to your accommodations
a good day
its always good if we stick to
the schedule
what is it
good news i hope
no my husband is not coming back
when he said he would come back
it must be a disappointment
it is a disappointment
but not a surprise
seventhirty is too late
i like to eat at seven
it is difficult for the kitchen
if we change
the usual schedules
i would like to see
the magic of the stars
well one of her films
is being shown in thirsk
why dont we watch
i should say no
why
your family is not here
you are your own mistress
thats fine
ill let barrow know
put on a coat
and tell grandma
grandma dont be angry
but im going to thirsk to see a movie
alone
with mr barber the director
have you heard from
from henry lately
he sent a telegram today
he is not coming back yet
denker change of plans
im not going to get ready
i want my dinner on a tray
milady
i am sorry
it is not your fault
that miss dalgleish
has the charm of a wart
mr dexter is nice
he can defend himself
without my help
not interested in movies
i watched a few
i prefer to eat rocks
in fact i think i will
stay in my bed
at least until everyone
leave
should i worry
florence nightingale crawled into
in bed at the age of 38
she passed away at the age of 90
you would tell me wouldnt you
what do you think
go
and you lord grantham
do you know the south of france
i know that lord brougham
made it fashionable
in the 1830s
when he was chancellor
so you are just recovering
what is rightfully yours
i wouldnt say that but i understand
why you are upset
but here you are
keeping an eye on the furniture
measuring the curtains
mom please we can
buy another country house
we are here
because your son invited us
but i would like to know why
your husband did this
i have asked our lawyer
to come here in a few days
i think its an excellent idea
until then i hope you enjoy
the stay
your butler brings an air of
of splendor to the proceedings
but he can withdraw
if he prefers
why the house already belongs
to your granddaughter
lady bagshaw
please
come and sit here
i am sorry
i went to rest for five minutes
i closed my eyes and blacked out
welcome to the house of doves
you must come here a lot
yes we do
or rather we were coming
before you guys showed up
always in winter
as long as i can remember
but now the fashion
is to come in the warmer months
i will write an article
about it
are you a writer lady hexham
im more of a journalist
i have a magazine
and im going to take back control of it
what is your article about
scott fitzgerald
zelda coco chanel
everyone who made the hotels
hotels stay open in july
may i publish
some pictures of the mansion
would that be possible
of course
if we can see the images
before using them
clearly she is not the first
journalist he has met
tickets please
sold out
we will have to postpone
our appreciation
of miss dalgleishs exhibition
for another time
this is not her film
the terror is the first film
fully spoken film
to be shown here
i thought it was
the jazz singer
in this one al jolson speaks a few
words to his mother
and he sings
in this one they talk
during the whole movie
where is the rialto bridge
take the next left
and park
lady mary went to the movies
in thirsk with mr barber
and lady grantham is
eating in her room
so mr dexter
and miss dalgleish
will dine alone
does mrs patmore know about this
you know
we feel sorry for mr dexter
what happened
wouldnt it be interesting
to you mrs hugues
you may speak
if you like
during the royal visit
do you remember a jack
named ellis
i remember
you became great friends
i remember
i received a letter from him
this morning
saying that he is going to get married
is that sad
i know it shouldnt be
mr barrow your path
in this life
is very difficult
most people
in your position
choose to hide
behind appearances
that allows them to avoid
persecution and rejection
he certainly must not
be blamed for this
its not what i want
mrs hugues
so you sir are a brave man
are a brave man
but it is also destined
to be lonely
unless you are very lucky
meet me at midnight
dont tell anyone
you said that her face
would sell a million tickets
not in thirsk apparently
but it was right of course
she is very beautiful
god save the king
how wonderful
i am still curious to know
why we are here
if you went to england
you would meet my mother
which would make more sense
i wanted to know you
more than lady grantham
and your mother
the situation is delicate for her
but she will be fine
i will make sure of it
over there
what is their game
make us feel safe
and then sue us
maybe they want to make us feel
feel guilty and give up the game
i think that monsieur de montmirail
loved his father
and intends to accomplish
what he wants
and we are here
representing grandma
the mysterious figure
of it all
bonjour monsieur
shine
no
coverage legal
yes
carson
can i help you
i think that might be it
you look like
king zog of albania
é
perfect
no no no
i wont allow that
i chose it so i pay
yeah but im the one whos going to use it
thank you sir
to both of them you
and your wife
if you were selling clothes
when he arrived in hollywood
how did you get into the world
of films
one day i was asked to pose
for a newspaper
with a suit
that they were advertising
and an agent came
and signed me up
since it is so beautiful
i thought they liked
my talent as an actor
girls go change your clothes
we want to go home
now you know
why i am at the movies
how did you become a butler
its far less glamorous
i got a job as a lackey
i was apprentice first servant
valet
and finally butler
i know all about running
a house sir
this is the difference
between you and me
i dont know what i am doing
most of the time
it is not what it seems
thank you
sir
just barrow sir
okay guy
lets rehearse please
myrna your line
i saved a cue for you
i always think they look like
instruments of war
thats because they are
there is a phone call for you
mr bullock he says its urgent
five minutes people
there is drama down there
the man in charge was shouting
on the phone when i arrived
it seems they are making the wrong
the wrong kind of film
is there a right kind
all i know is that it seems that the public
only wants movies that talk
i thought the best thing about movies
is that you cant hear them
it would be even better
if i couldnt see them too
everyone gather around please
everybody
we are suspending production
i know i know
i regret to be the bearer
of bad news
we will contact you
when we run out of plans
thank you
what is it what happened
it seems that talking movies
are making a lot of money
while our film is silent
and expensive to recover the costs
so they want to cut their losses
and shut us down
how sad
it is worse for the men and women
who work at it
we still owe the extras
and now they are out of a job
i told you
excuse me
myrna
why is he stopping
apparently silent films
no longer make money
i saw it one night
the theater was almost empty
what a shame
i feel sorry for mr barber
he doesnt deserve that
i wish i could help
i wish i could too
but i dont know how
we are doing a mute
they only want to launch spoken so
why not turn it
into a talking movie
what would this mean
getting a coach from london
he could record the sound
for scenes we already did and
and put new lines in the rest
why wouldnt it work
mr mason
is driving me crazy
all cups and saucers
need to be right
you are his daughterinlaw
his son died in the war
no wonder he and i
dont get along
it is a pity
that he is annoying you
because he is a lovely man
and he likes you very much
daisy
didnt you have a crush on him
once
about a hundred years ago
i heard that a sound specialist
is coming from london
dont remind me
are you okay
can i help you
no one can help me now
come on
if it isnt just barrow
sir
i thought this big house
is much more interesting
than our silly movie
dont call me sir
is there anything i can do
unless you have ideas
for my next career
i dont understand
the movies were mimes
until now
mimes with music
now with the talking movies
they will be about acting
they wont want us
they will hire real actors
from the theater and
we will be finished
but you have a good voice
there may be some new faces coming in
but the public will not want to
to say goodbye to old favorites
i hope you are right
sir
that is the yacht
of the duke of westminster
let me summarize
in the years after 1864
the late marquis de montmirail
made four wills
in each one he refers to the fact
of having given the villa des colombes
to the then dowager countess
of grantham in 1865
i brought the originals
ill leave copies
so clearly
it was not something that was forgotten
he intended this
and kept his decision
i feel better for it
she must have had
some power over him
she must have blackmailed him
maman that is a silly answer
we will challenge it in court
based on what madam
you have other homes
its not about hardship
her husband bought the mansion
and disposed of it before he met her
my advice would be to hand over
the property without delay
thank you very much
do you intend to accept that
of course my father made me
sole executor lord grantham
i think he trusted me
to fulfill his desires
then why did you invite us here
i was curious to meet him
my father and his mother
spent a week together
in october 1864
and i was born in july 1865
precisely
i think that is the reason why
he gave her the mansion after a month
in gratitude for his birth
in other words
i believe that you and i
have a lot in common
we should thank
lady grantham
of course
now we know
that for her to have the villa
was not a random choice
or a foolish mistake
but a decision firmly
supported for many years
its funny in a way
knowing that my daughter
is from the golden circle where
because of his blood
beautiful things happen
just as mary will have downton
and we will have brompton
but they are working
of work
here was made
to laugh and have fun
wouldnt sybil be happy
for her daughter
and encouraged her to use
for the good of others
yes i think she would
so lets do the same
i look forward to bringing sybbie here
shell love it
look at this view
dont you feel grateful
that we are alive
i love you you know
i thought i would never love
again
and i love you
so its all good
shall we go back the water is
they seem
very happy together
this is how it should be
its exciting for sybbie
for all of them
i like that tom and lucy have
a meeting here every summer
until it became
a family tradition
the sun made me sleepy
if youll excuse me im going to take
a nap before dinner
you look tired too
why dont you do the same
i wont be long
she is right
you look tired
i dont understand how it is useful
for people to say that
i am sorry
never stop writing
mom
if there is something bothering you
please say so
no not at all really
i had to change the arrangement
of the dining table again
but i think they got the hang of it
the way of passing
his lordships shirts
finally
you should have let me do that
you must be very grateful
for your help mr carson
well maybe when i showed
them how to do this
they spoke french
very loud and very fast
is everything settled
it seems that the mansion now
belongs to miss sybbie
lucky girl
do you envy her ms baxter
im not a big believer
in envy mr bates
i know what i want
and i can live without a mansion
in the south of france
what do you want
miss baxter
please mr carson
we all know what she wants
your affections are
firmly committed
they are not committed
uncommitted
in that way perhaps
but completely taken
are we talking about
mr molesley
we are
but suppose
that he never takes action
then ill be an old maid
you would never marry
to anyone else
it took me a long time
to find him
madam
i dont know how long
he thought about it
but he checked the dates
he made sure
i was born exactly nine
months later
i mean the idyllic interlude
they spent together
and he gave the mansion
right after i was born
i am sure that
that it is all a coincidence
does it really
that would explain the mystery
your father loved you very much
but it is rosamund
who looks like him
i hope i have helped you milady
thank you baxter
good evening
good night
whats that for whats up
just a little heartburn im fine
what will happen
if the story is released
i suppose carson
will deliver his notice
dont be ridiculous you are the least
least french person i have ever met
you dont even like garlic
this is not exactly
proof of anything
how did they do it
so fast
because time is money
the problem is
what will the actors say
what do you mean
i write the lines for them
but they dont always adhere to the text
and sometimes we dont remember
what the actors say
why not let
mr molesley help
why
what can you do
he is the principal of the school
of the mansion
and i know that he can read lips
he could help
in something
this is really true
and he was here every day
and watched every scene
okay mr barber im ready
bring in the actors
that sounds
very professional milady
if you dont mind my saying so
it is the new speed reflex
you can see the image
before you take it down
what will they think of next
how are you doing down there
all right i guess sir
although they are very french
the french arent they
i suppose they are obligated
i suppose they are
poor things
thats very good but carson
could you take the phone out
that spoils it a bit
it is beautiful to see you
enjoying your work
its good to have a point
support in the real world again
something like that yes
my goodness
what is it
take a look
who is she
this is lady grantham
who i started working for
like a young page
wet behind the ears
grandma
heavens
thank you carson
could you give us a moment
what does it say
violette mon adorée
my god
mary had a little lamb
his wool was white as snow
okay mr stubbins
are you ready
as ready as i can be
mr barber for i did not control
the sound insulation or the set
call mr dexter please
guy
where are the lines
i am sorry
no no
thank you
and here
time the speech
to match the movie
no dont lean
and try not to move your head
very good
ring the bell
to ask for silence
e
sound rolling
well if it isnt lady anne
i thought i could find myself
nobody can keep a secret
a secret these days
just a reminder
which is my future
for me to throw away
no wait
dont go
cut
very good
miss dalgleish
ready
and action
i knew where you would be
i just came to
hold on
i turned my head there
you yes
i wrote a
to cover this see
i only came to stop you
from throwing away your future
you go back to the future
right
and action
i knew where you would be
i just came to stop
who throws away his future
louder
i cant stay
and watch you ruin yourself
i must
cut
thank you myrna
could you give me a minute
are you okay
what now mr stubbins
i am here to record sound
not to perform miracles
lady anne erskine
that she is not
couldnt she learn the accent
the accent and try again
people try their whole
their whole lives and fail
george b shaw
wrote a play about it
you could do it milady
you saw how mr dexter did it
it cant be that hard
but i couldnt
what couldnt
do the accent
i think it could
i think it does
but i am not an actress
well myrna is an actress
looking forward to seeing
her hedda gabler
even so
look just try
if you dont succeed
we will close forever
if you can
will allow us to continue
please
how do we deal
with miss dalgleish
now take her
back up
we need to see if it will work
ill do it
miss dalgleish
here are the lines milady
thank you
i dont know how i get into
into these things
i knew where you would be
i only came to stop you
from throwing away your future
i cant stay
and watch you ruin yourself
i have to go
and cut
touch them together
well if it isnt lady anne
i thought you might find me
you cant keep
a secret these days
i knew where you would be
ive only come to stop you
from throwing away your future
just a reminder
which is my future
for me to throw away
i cant stay
and watch you ruin yourself
no wait
dont go
i have to go
i hope it was
it was a prop
when was it painted
and why was she your beloved
why did she grant
the final favor
they were together only
a few days does it seem likely
and its just a coincidence
that daddy was born
nine months later
i imagine that
when she got home
your grandfather was very
happy to see her
anyway
monsieur de montmirail was
madly in love with her
when did he get married
i know that i looked
she married in 1870 five years
after roberts birth
and the current marquis
was born in 1873
so the mansion was a parting gift
of farewell
to his grandmother before
that he looked for a wife
thats what it looks like
evidently
i will probe it
about mrs patmore
you cant
i can
you know that she
has a house of her own
you know she is lonely
it is a solution for all of us
they sound very conspiratorial
we talked about mrs patmore
and how much she likes you
does she really like it
well i like her
she is a good woman
she is
but sometimes i worry
that im lonely
he has his own house of course
but i think i would like
to have company there
i know what you are thinking
but the answer is no
you always said
that you admired her
and i admire it
but i wouldnt live off her
it wouldnt be right
even if she wanted to
even then
there are things that are right
and there are things that are wrong
and i cant change that
thank you for accepting
i owe you a lot
is everything in order
well
once we record the sound
of the scenes weve already shot
we will need new material
for what is missing
may i speak mr barber
of course
i went through all
the dialogue letters
that would be shown
if the image were silent
and started sketching scenes
that would cover the needs
needs of the plot
have you written a play
well i started one
could i read these scenes
of course
and if you are satisfied
ill do the rest
am i limited
by the plot synopsis
for example
when she finally rejects him
wouldnt it be better
with a big romantic climax
i dont understand
bill benson is about to
to throw his life away
alone empty and without hope
suddenly he raises his face
and sees anne standing there
tall serene graceful
her eyes shining
with unshed tears
on an impulse
he takes his money back
rien ne va plus
the wheel spins
and everything he has
would be gone
but no
her love her beauty
saved him
she takes his hand
and they leave
together
end
i think im going to cry
mr molesley please
finish the script
as you see fit
and bring it to me
right
you said he worked here
yes
he was a servant
but we didnt know
of his hidden talents
poor carson
you must be cooking
in these clothes
isnt there a lighter model
model that he can use
i believe so
thank you monsieur
but we english
dont get hot
by wearing the correct attire
i invited some friends over tomorrow
to say goodbye
and introduce you
but the presence of your butler
reminds me
that we are your guests
and i should have asked
please
heres to your fortunate granddaughter
sybil branson
to sybbie
sybbie
i wish she were here
to meet her
i hope you will meet her one day
she is lovely
its good to hear a stepmother
talk like this
you must be happy
the way things are
when the ones you love are lucky
is almost better than being lucky
almost but not quite
yes
do you know the miniatures
in the library
one of them is grandmas
and it is engraved on the side
ive seen it
i was forced to see her there
for more than half a century
but he forbade me to take it off
he made me swear
any more news
from mr talbot
not since the phone call
i told you about
you must miss him
milady
i just hope he feels my
his lordship
will soon be home
im afraid he will have a shock
did you enjoy the filming
in a way
i liked mr barber
and mr dexter
and see how a film is made
but
i was a little
disappointed as well
for miss dalgleish
it sounds silly but i thought
that we would become friends
they say it is a mistake to meet
their favorite stars
in this case they are right
are you happy
i am
but there is work to be done
the harder you work
the happier you will be
well you already know me
and yes i want to enjoy
sybbies luck
i want us all to enjoy it
congratulations tom
you are a leopard who has changed
your spots successfully
he is very fast
no
where is the ball it is gone
good move
thats it how about it
george should be in bed
or at least on his way
do you have other children
a daughter caroline
with my second husband
georges father died in a car accident
car accident seven years ago
the day george was born
he held the baby in his lap
and died on the way home
my god
what was he like
it was perfect really
beautiful like a prince
from a fairy tale
moralistic strong with dreams
determined to do his part
do you miss him
of course
although i wonder
what life would have made of him
if he had lived
in a way
one way
i was going to say in a way
that you remind me of him
although i cannot say
why
i am flattered
what about your current husband
henry is more pragmatic
there are no dreams about him
he is an executioner
it tests your endurance
from morning until night
but he is a good coworker
is he handsome too
yes
i like the pretty ones
but is there trouble in paradise
you dont need me to tell you
marriage is a soap opera
not a short story
full of twists and turns
suppose it all boils down to
whether you love him or not
really mr barber
its because working on the movies
i think i have counted enough
for one night
i hope you warmly welcome
our successors to the mansion
and with the bransons perhaps
you will see lord grantham
who i think i can call
my good friend
he handled everything
with such good manners
because he thinks he is my brother
for a moment
i thought you were going to speak
you cant talk like that
your father loved you thats enough
but its not enough is it
not when i could be
a fraud throughout life
a frenchman who stole the role
of the proper heir
but that would be matthews father
and now his son
who will inherit
then what difference does it make
in the long run
im afraid its a real
blow to daddy
discover that you may
be an impostor
if its true
he will be devastated
maman
you know i liked seeing
you working here
i got a preview
of what you are missing
i dont think im ready
to say goodbye to this
part of my life
i looked at the miniature
lady hexham and you are right
the matter is settled
please take it to your grandmother
its hers anyway
just a moment please
what is it
whatever your secret is
is not a good time
to share with daddy
yes nothing compares to the sea
that one was beautiful it was
you have been so kind
but its time to go home
we will too soon
as you know the contents of the house
already belongs to your mother
you should take what you want
no his wishes were clear
our lawyers
can manage the rest
i know its late
but can we walk
yes of course
monsieur
we are indebted to you
thank you
madame
thank you
why didnt you tell me before
i was and suddenly
we were coming here
but you never
should have come here
we have to get her to a doctor
not some quack in marseilles
dr clarkson is able
of presenting a diagnosis
we will go to london
we will go to america if you need us
well discuss it better later
you should have told me
with the chance of disease
take over our lives
it cant be that bad
robert i run a hospital
do you think i just sat there
and heard nothing
no no no no
no no
thats not what i want
we are not sad people
the fact that i am sick now
does not make us sad
oh my gosh my
losing my mother and my name
can i lose you too
i cant take it
if i can take it you can
remember
that i love you from the beginning
i loved him before he loved me
i was always ashamed of it
dont have i had money
you needed it
and then came love
and we are happy arent we
hon
you are everything to me
all
and i hope to be everything
for a while yet
now
we must start early tomorrow
and its past
past my bedtime
hon
i hope we can get passage
for the blue train
why is the camera
in a padded case
anyone would think
to be a lunatic
it is certainly unpredictable
the microphone cannot pick up
any noise
unless i approve
the padded box contains
the sound of the camera running
so we are really
in your hands mr stubbins
your words not mine
everybody ready
lets go for a take
e
be aware
from where the microphones are
and speak clearly
and this time myrna
mime but dont speak
no word right
im not an idiot
we just want to hear from lady mary
mary please
very good
albert is the clapperboard ready
ring the bell
roll the camera
albert
e
action
madame messieurs
placez vos paris
bill
you are back
i always come back
sorry
cut
sorry
everybody back to
to the beginning please
roll the camera
and action
madame messieurs
placez vos paris
bill

its hard for me because
she is right in my ear
and he caught me walking out of there
i understand
restart please
bill
you are back
i always come back
holy shit
no need to swear
myrna im sorry
thats enough
myrna
get your hands off me
get out of my way
myrna darling
no
what now
i knew she would be
a problem from the start
she is rude crude
fact but now she
also feels humiliated
moving her mouth as
lady marys voice comes out of it
and this is his
first sound film
what will happen to her
i guess her career
is over
i suppose for many it is over
the point is that they
have to bring her back
but what if she doesnt come
they cant force her
why dont you two go
you know how to talk to her
they dont
myrna dear
please come down
we cant do anything without you
you can talk without me
just go away
milady
i think it is a good idea
to let the maids
see if you can make her
comfortable mr barber
if you think so yes
stand back everyone
may we
come in miss dalgleish
we understand
what you are going through
this is true
and you know it
im not going out just to
humiliate me and laugh at me
they wont do that
you should hear them at the premieres
dont speak dont open your mouth
they despise me
why didnt you take
diction classes lots of people do
i tried i couldnt
i didnt get it right
something has been bothering you
since you got here
what is it
thats it
i knew it was over
as soon as i saw the jazz singer
it looks like a sword
hanging over me
i thought i would have a few more
films but this will be the last
you dont know that
it was fine as far as i could see
and how do i look
the fact is that i am finished
as the yanks say
i am a thing of the past
lets go maam
you are not talking
with your fan club right now
what
you are famous beautiful and rich
so what if your career
in cinema is over
there are other things
you can do
now pull yourself together
in the meantime try to be polite
polite with people
come on daisy
you are one of us
not like them
just remember that
now lets go
fix your hair
and lets go
how are you doing there
shes almost ready
mr barber
you are arent you
miss dalgleish
i had a sister like you
i miss her every single day
you remind me of her
she died of
flu in 1919
i didnt think it would touch our family but
family but you never know
lets go
im not worth it
you are worth it to me
rien ne va plus
it seems that you
are my savior
and i intend to continue as your
your savior for a long time to come
mary
what the hell is going on
cut
no
so you put them in place
i think i can say that
without fear of contradiction
i did not leave them in doubt
how to do things
things correctly
mr bates
you made
your feelings clear
they learned how to deal
with an english butler
get your coats
watching you
i remembered the pieces
that the three of them were doing in the attic
except that there is a lot
more to it this time
i dont want to be harsh
but how do we know shes good
she is absolutely superb
i showed the telegram
from daddy to grandma
tom
you should take a look
we can go up now
you are right
it must be you
you can give her the thumbnail
what is this miniature
it is a long story
talkies are good news for west end
for west end actors
good news for them
bad news for me
death by microphone isnt it guy
our business has always
been a game of chance
well said
i have an idea
miss dalgleish
that can help
i will take your mother
to the hospital first thing in the morning
i am apprehensive of course
but this is for you
to hear not for her
i thought they
could fight more
so do we
mom wanted it
and then edith
found this
there is something written next to it
i i think they think
that something improper
happened between us
i believe everyone thinks
no
i wouldnt say that
you are a terrible
liar tom
i would never get anywhere
if i was a liar like you
we will try to meet
at the mansion every year
the whole family together
in the summer
wont it be too hot
we hope you
come and find out
no
no thats over for me
never mind
i am happy to have
met you tom
i think that in the end
we got along pretty well didnt we
i think so
in the end
you were not what we had
in mind for sybil
but we overcame it
and thats life isnt it
overcoming the unexpected
and maybe learning from it
what i think we can say
say we did
you have been my good friend
over the years violet
i hope it was for you
and now you are settled
maud is back in the family
and everyone is happy
when was the miniature painted
did you pose for this
no we we
we went for a walk in the city one day
and there was a store where a man
was taking pictures
yes i remember because
he was the first photographer
i had already seen it
they must have copied from that
montmirail sent me to london
with a silly scribbled letter
i sent it back
of course i should have burned it
we will let you rest
but we wanted to say
how grateful we are
and sybbie will be too
it is a beautiful place
this i remember
time for bed
yes ill just fix that
what are they
the letters
from monsieur de montmirail
are they well named
im afraid so
so she lied when she said
that she didnt remember
lying would be heavy
maybe i forgot a little
i cant believe you didnt remember
everything that happened
i will ask when i go to see her
is this the way i find
mr barrow
left
so this is where it hides
is there anything i can
with anything sir
well start by not calling me sir
sir
im not sure
what mr carson would think
if i were to receive a guest
from upstairs mr dexter
well mr carson is not
in charge now
you are
suppose someone walks in
what would they say
i dont mind
i have lived in america for ten years
i dont believe
these things anymore
please call me guy
what is your real name
quentin
quentin sidebotham
that was a good decision
do you know what you will do next
i dont think anyone knows
i will go home and wait for
the events
you could call clive brook
or charlie chaplin
see what they think
do you know charlie chaplin
a little wild
for me but yes i know him
hollywood has a bad
publicity
but i live in a place called
hancock park
and its pretty cool
i believe
well why dont you come
and see for yourself
what
i mean
i travel a lot for work and
i dont have a wife
to take care of me so
you could take care of
would i be your jack
more than that
you would manage the house
and organize our trips
make me comfortable
it would make us both comfortable
if my career is over
we will have to rethink
your career will not end
good
well
let me know when you have
reached a decision
right
i have everything i need
i will go to the house
with the results
as soon as you have them
but do you feel optimistic
robert you dont need
this kind of talk
lady grantham understands too much
to pretend she doesnt
but even though everything
may seem bad
there is still a surgery
lets take it one step at a time
my goodness
robert doesnt see it but things
could be much worse
how many face these things
wasting their lives
i dont
no way
how are things at the farm
tight
poor mr mason
he would be so unhappy
to hear you say that
he has been talking
about you lately
really
saying what a beautiful woman
you are and how much he admires you
him really
but he will not
take it any further
why not
because he cant ask
you to live on the farm
and cannot be
dependent on a woman
cant he
we will see about that
heres what we found
when i was going through
violets things
the letters
of the marquis of montmirail
wow it doesnt look
good for dad
if she had to
to keep this a secret
well lets not hurry
im sorry did they say anything
no no
can i talk to you alone
yes
so what happens now
well i thought we could
read them together
bertie you and i can do
this and report whats in it
and lets break the news to daddy
what happened
you have to help me
we are about to shoot
our last act
the dinner when benson
realizes that he must give up on her
and runs to london
i know i just learned
molesley did
a wonderful job
i said that the extras were
tired of not being paid
and i dont blame them but im still waiting for the money
im still waiting for the money
theyre not going to do
anything too drastic are they
they say they wont work
but how can i help
can your servants help
you can ask them
there is something else
mr barber
i would never have gone through
through any of this without you
if this is true
then i am happy
can i kiss you
no
dont you want to
im afraid im
too oldfashioned to believe
that what i want is the
only thing that matters
have i offended you
not at all
nothing is more pleasant
for a married woman
than to discover that she
is still an object of desire
better not tell your husband
when he returns he might
hit me on the nose
wouldnt that be exciting
two beautiful men
fighting for my favors
you called milady
did she keep his letters
apparently all of them
i will not ask what you have hidden
if you tell me the answer
most of them
are quite sad
there was clearly no love
between him and his wife
but what do they say about
the days you spent in france
im afraid they didnt
corresponded at the time
so we still have no proof
of what really happened
i suppose thats where
where the mystery lies
im going to see violet tomorrow
should i go
no
you are what lawyers call
an interested party
i dont
meaning that we would be
up there on the screen
with miss dalgleish
and mr dexter
are you sure
thats what i mean
i will do it
so will mr carson
mr molesley will
want to participate
how many do you need
we need ten
mrs denker would you like it
maybe not
i want to keep an eye
on his lordship
what about mr mason
you might ask
run to the farm
and ask him
and do they have clothes for us
they will need time
to adjust
come up for a taste
at the end of the day
we are created
who will wait for us
i was thinking
we could use albert
would you be serving
miss dalgleish
i think so
well okay lets
back to work please
all right lets go
filming must be the slowest
slowest occupation known to man
it makes a glacier
look impatient
i suppose robert
is in hell
he was wishing it would all
would be over when they returned
you can ease
his pain if you want
we find the letters
of monsieur de montmirail
but robert still doesnt have
the answer he needs
i wont pretend
that i dont understand you
did they talk about the miniature
what is its meaning
well could you get it
it is in the bottom right drawer
opening at the back
you will find the letter
he sent with it
it is still there after
after all this time
could you read it
chère violette
we missed the chance
to know perfect love
but we still can
if you just change your mind
why didnt you just
not tell us
there was nothing to tell
nothing happened
besides years of being harassed
well no
this is not
totally correct
so what is it
i never saw him after that
i knew i would have given in
if i had been tempted
again i would have failed
i was a fool for love
back then
a few years later
we went to russia
and i got myself
in terrible trouble
well i almost did
with prince kuragin
yes i know
how did you avoid this
with the marquis
i cant imagine
he was the most attractive man
i have ever met in my life
but i was newly married
and it would have been a shame you know
to spoil that
i wish you had
i didnt want you to think
that my life was a fraud
why it wasnt
i was happy
with roberts father
well happy enough
in that english way
when you never speak
about anything
but trust each other
if they had put
kuragin and montmirail together
i would have come out as a
sort of scarlet woman
you dont look
very scarlet
well i am trusting
in you to be sure
that this is not how
that i will be remembered
well the next earl
will be matthews son
my grandson your greatgrandson
i will do my best
to make him value his name
i know it will
i know i can trust you
to do the right thing
this is very generous
on your part
because we had
our fights you and i
well thats true but im glad
that you came to downton
i have never met anyone
in whose opinion
i could trust
be morally correct
not for years
well not since
since my mother died
you must have asked yourself
why i asked you
to examine my papers
i wondered
when i think of that world
of long ago
when i i was a girl
in my first crinoline
in those moments
i feel as if i had been
transported
to a different planet
and so you have been
like every human being
who lives long enough
and i have lived a lot
i didnt mean that
im sorry but i
could not wait
everything is fine nothing happened
you are your fathers son
i cant pretend
that i am not relieved
i cant pretend
that i am not insulted
why do you think
he gave you the mansion
if it has nothing to do
with my birth
i think it had everything to do
with his birth
when you were born
sent a message
that what he wanted
would never happen
and it was time to move on
he never loved his wife
as he loved you
the mansion is proof of this
well
its not for me to say
right
i looked at the final scenes
i am impressed
this kind of work appeals to you
writing plays for the screen
what you mean
say four a year
i would send you the book or short story
that i am interested
with my notes and suggestions
i would pay 700 guineas
up to a thousand
mr barber
what
i would earn 700
for writing the script
it would rise to a thousand
if the film is made
for each route
i feel like the queen
i dont envy you
if you need to wear these corsets
this is absurd
cheer up
after all you must be
used to the costume
we put the names in the places
so please
find your chair and sit down
mr carson you will play
lord pumphrey
at the end of the table
it feels strange
to be sitting here
you have spent too much time standing
i would say that you
spent enough time
you may be right
mr dexter
tell me does your offer mean
what i think it means
it can mean
whatever you want
i would like
that it meant a lot
then you are in luck
mrs hughes
thank you
you are here
i dont even recognize you
e
no not really
please we are not here
my lord if you could go
behind the camera
thank you
i look like something
to scare crows
nonsense you are
the image of elegance
now sit down here
and have something to warm you up
i thought it was
just colored water
for others it really is
to us
i smuggled in something cool
you are right this is good
doesnt the young couple
look good together
it must be wonderful to feel
that you are helping
i would like to do more
well thats what
that i want to talk to you about
arent you nervous
how a man should feel
when all your dreams
come true
all your dreams
i know
but you see miss baxter
phyllis
phyllis
i felt ashamed
the best i could offer
it was a poor life
on a teachers salary
i would have accepted it
but now you wont have to
i will write plays
to be made into movies
for mr barber
for him now but who knows
what will happen if i do well
its going to be talking movies
from now on
what is this drug
for the first time
i can offer
a decent and prosperous life
for both of us
so what do you say
wont you kneel down
do you want me to kneel
i think so
it wont happen again
okay so
you want to marry me
miss baxter
i mean phyllis
yes
i accept very happily
mr molesley
congratulations dear
very good mr molesley
very good mr molesley
please calm down
lets go to the first take
say that again
barkis is willing
mr mason
and you will be content
to live in my little house
unless you think it is wrong
i certainly dont think so
the younger ones
can keep the farm
i will turn in the lease
well ill drink to that
okay and if we can
remember
clarity diction
and keep your head still
thank you
thank you
prepare the camera
and action

milady
thank you barrow
milady could i speak with you
of course
i would like to hand in
my notice
i know that you
have not always been happy here
it is not that milady
i had good years at downton
but i formed a kind of
im not sure what it is
really
a working friendship
with mr dexter
with guy
thats right milady
and we intend to travel together
he will make movies
and i will take care of him
im going to be his agent
as the movie people say
and if i am right
is the closest i have come
the offer
of an honest way of life
no need to explain barrow
i wish you all the best
and i hope you will be as happy
as our cruel world leaves you
thank you milady
so what
it is done
great
i want to know if you will miss
your acting career
say yes come to london
and well give you a part
no thank you
i liked it really
but once is enough
i can help you
miss dalgleish
i would love
some of this ham
if you can reach it
and a little sauce
what happened to your voice
what do you mean
you missed the horrible
of course i didnt mean horrible exactly
exactly
she is a born talent
lady grantham
do you think i can go to hollywood
and be an american
why dont you go
agree with me bertie
will you excuse me
i just want to go downstairs
thank you
why is she so cool
all of a sudden
it is simple
she is no longer afraid
do you know that i am
completely crazy about you
dear mr barber
i cant give you
what you want
but i can say that i loved
working with you
and i should be content with that
thats all youre going to get
i am happy as my fathers son
because i loved him
it matters more to me
than all dynastic things
it should be just like that
i am happy for sybbie
as long as she learns to give back
dont believe in the idle rich
i believe in them
i just dont want
my family to be one
that sounds good to me
ill have another cup
excuse me
does this include any future members
of your family
yes of course because
its early
so dont say anything yet
my dear
i wont say anything
but i think i can kiss you
dr clarkson has arrived my lord
i notice that you are very friendly
with the handsome mr barber
dont start
i stayed out of trouble
and ive been good
with some difficulties
i must add
it is not what you were afraid of
pernicious anemia is often confused
confused with cancer
and even a few years ago
it could have ended with you
but now there is treatment
thank god
it will not be
particularly pleasant
but you will get better
and you wont die
well thank you dr clarkson
thank you very very very much
yes thank you
now you must come in
for dinner
but it will be every man for himself
that night
all created
are movie stars now
we will never bring them
through the servants wing
milorde
milady come quickly
please hurry
doctor
speak again
speak in that voice
i just want to say
how grateful i am
you both helped me
when i needed it
thank you
are you going to hollywood now
why not i have no family
holding me here
and ive made a talking movie now
which puts me in the forefront
just dont forget who you are
and not even where you came from
but also dont let
let it stop you either
and good luck
come here
old lady grantham
is sinking very fast
they are up there with her now
grab a coffee or something stronger
just in case
charlie are you okay
what did king lear say
winds blow away
the very cheeks
rage blow hard
trumpets and cataracts
the moment of her departure
finally arrived
that such a great lady
must depart
when the house is full
of moviegoers
maud
what are you doing here
you wont believe me
but i will miss you
or did you come just to check
if ive already gone
do you want something
whatever i wanted
sweet boy
you gave me long before
and over and over again
dear mama i hope i have not been
have been a disappointment
you have always been smarter
than me
true
but dont let this
come between us now
you are much kinder
than i ever was
cora i owe you an apology
i didnt think you would last
i know
but i was wrong
this is something that you
have never heard me say before
it was worth the wait
mary dear and edith
you were wonderful granddaughters
and i leave you two
confident that your lives
will be happy and fruitful
grandma
dear grandma
well that should be enough
or will i be like one
of those guests
who put their bags in the car
and never leave
milady
stop that noise
i cant hear myself die
take that too
thank you bates
strange day
for you and for me
we are orphans at last
good morning
good morning
milady
she would be so happy
with you here
i remember the first time
i really saw you milady
up close i mean
i had just been
promoted
and was in the dining room
with the old butler
mr mountjoy
i was terrified of him
but then
she came towards us
she was angry
at something
and i could see him trembling
i never forgot that
and never again
was i ever afraid of him again
you belong to our history
in fact i wonder
if your part is already over
would you consider coming back
for a little while longer
milady
barrow is leaving
and i cannot train
a new butler by myself
andrew could be
his righthand man
while you train him
to succeed you
do you think he could handle it
well certainly
in time
his lordships brooch
so now the torch
of downton has passed to you
for my father
but if im going to carry it too
i will try to do it with pride
i cannot pretend that i am not
scared
you dont have to be
you have the strength
do i
sometimes i have doubts
well i dont
not for a moment
and you can always count on me
if it means anything
it means a lot
and i think you know
now i just need some time
before we go
milady
what did she have to say
she wants me back home
as a butler
does she really want to
we have to go
thank you for organizing this
she left the instructions
in minute detail
i can imagine
you will bury me one day
and i am happy to see
that it will be well done
i suppose the point is
crawleys come and go
but the family continues
mom knew this
and believed it
not only her
lets go inside
here they are
andy

how beautiful
are you tired
sybbie how are you
