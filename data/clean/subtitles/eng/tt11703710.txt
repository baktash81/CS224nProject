i received a letter from mr  murray 
he is coming to downton on tuesday 
  why did you call him 
  i didn t 
it was his grandmother who called him 
he wants us there 
rosamund  you should come with us 
  my goodness 
  why do you say that 
there is only one reason for ladies
call their lawyers 
sit down 
i feel like the andromeda
chained to a rock
with you hovering over me 
i don t know why murray
called them without asking me 
neither do we 
denker 
mr  murray will be here soon 
he has arrived  milady 
he said that the lady
is waiting for him 
what  why didn t you tell me 
you shouldn t be
so suspicious 
you told them 
lady grantham  good 
please 
she didn t say anything 
well  that s easy to tell 
i took possession of a mansion
in the south of france 
and now i have given the mansion
to my great granddaughter  sybbie 
what 
which part don t you understand 
i didn t understand any part of it 
what mansion  where 
this is too extraordinary
to talk about 
it is la villa des colombes 
and it s near toulon 
but why is it yours 
and why did
did you never talk about it 
because i thought it was a joke 
start at the beginning 
years ago 
before you were born 
i was in france 
and i met a man 
the marquis of montmirail 
and he invited me
to spend some time
in the mansion
that he had just bought 
about a year later 
he sent me a letter
and said that he had
transferred the mansion
for my name 
i never thought it was serious 
so i didn t pay attention 
but wasn t it a joke 
i guess not 
he died recently 
and to the widow s dismay 
the mansion they have used
in winter for years 
was registered in the name
of lady grantham 
he never changed 
  now  i need signatures 
  of course 
why did you give the mansion
to sybbie 
your children are
well established here 
and edith is
more than well taken care of 
but brompton will be a son
of tom and lucy 
so sybil s only daughter
will inherit little 
and i wanted to correct this 
what family does he have 
this man  montmirail 
the widow and a son 
the present marquis 
the mother is interested in taking
the matter to court 
  you can t blame her 
  why not 
if her husband wanted
the place to be mine 
why should we argue 
have you never thought of refusing 
do i look like i m turning down
a mansion in the south of france 
mr  murray 
  may i ask you a favor 
  please 
i have an assignment for you 
everything is explained in this letter 
i will call you in a few days
to clarify doubts 
of course  lady grantham 
  now i hear my train calling 
  goodbye  mr  murray 
and thank you 
you want me to tell you
why he did it 
but the truth is  i don t know 
and so  i will say good night 
and let them argue
about my mysterious past 
denker  don t lead me on 
i am not a car 
unfortunately 
i ask for forgiveness 
really should try it   
that sounds strange 
they spend a few days
at the same resort
for more than 60 years 
and he gives her a house 
i suppose he was not
just a lunatic 
that is what they will try to prove 
i think it s admirable of grandma
to want to take care of sybbie 
even though mr  montmirail
is a stone cold madman 
but why did mama
never commented 
as far as she knows  she received
a very eccentric letter
for more than half a century 
you thought it was a waste of time
at the moment 
and never thought about it again 
  very good  marigold 
  go ahead 
i find it amazing that they have   
  that s right  good move 
  stay back 
grandma  look 
a call for you 
  who is it 
  a mr  barber 
  it s from british lion 
  what is it 
it s a film production company  isn t it 
i d better find out
what he wants 
what are you going to do with the mansion
in the summer 
they can t go 
nobody goes there in the summer 
  now go 
  it sure is hot 
apparently not 
  mommy 
  hi  sweetheart 
mommy  come and play 
it s a race  come on  hurry up 
 good deeds    
mr  barber became
a producer and director 
he wants to practice
chronophotography here 
it s not the stone age 
dad 
he wants to make
a film on downton 
what did you say 
  i declined gently 
  i ll call back 
  i want to hear his offer 
  for what 
i suppose there will be a payment 
  when will henry be back 
  there is no time for that 
where is he now 
his last message came
from istanbul or somewhere else 
but as far as i m concerned 
the rally idea is noisy 
you can manage without it 
got it 
so it s up to me  right 
don t expect us to deal
with movie people 
first  let s hear
his proposal 
come  mary 
i ll keep you company 
the money will be useful  that s for sure 
is everything okay with henry 
he is passionate about cars 
passionate about speed 
passionate about adventure 
besides being in love
with me  i guess 
but i don t nullify the other three 
  and you thought you would 
  i guess i did 
ready for you 
it is perfect 
until recently  cinema
was confined to the studios 
but now 
this process is changing 
napoléon  by abel gance 
last year 
showed what a camera
does on location 
filming in a house 
in real landscapes 
what kind of film 
the gambleris  made in 1875 
the daughter of an earl 
lady anne erskine 
fell in love with a man
who was a gambler 
  to the horror of the family 
  i can imagine 
they meet
in a country house
and things get out of hand 
there are visitors at a gaming club 
which would be here 
a gambling club in downton 
that would end up with grandma 
and with daddy  too 
  we need to think 
  of course 
here is my card 
call me at
if you have any questions 
barrow will accompany you 
i believe that there are questions
that need answers
before we actually discuss 
we would stay here
about a month 
and if you turn the card over 
you will see how much we will pay 
of course  this is negotiable 
  goodbye  mr  barber 
  goodbye  mr  barber 
and that s just for starters 
i think it s a horrible idea 
highly makeup actresses
and plastered actors 
messing up our stuff 
we would continue to count
the spoons 
the locals would
with bad eyes 
you must not let
it stop you 
the county takes a dim view
of everything 
you should consider the money 
we don t need to
talk about money 
but you need to think about it 
we can have a new roof 
soon we will have real floods 
and then what 
if you refuse 
do you think we can convince them
driving further north
to bancaster 
mom  what do you think 
mary  dear  would you take your father
to see the attics 
i don t believe
that he has visited recently 
i haven t been here in years 
well  this is our
current situation 
with the money  we can
put the house in order
balancing what we spend
on the property 
and enter the 1930s
with our heads held high 
  but if you don t want to   
  no 
no  you will command 
you are the captain now 
i am aware of that 
even if i think otherwise 
and now i have
the unenviable task
to break the news to mr  carson 
i don t believe it 
making a movie here 
can they do that 
will it be a movie with stars 
celebrities 
give him some water before he passes out 
there is nothing decided yet 
it s okay to get excited 
you live on the farm 
the rest of us will come and go
around every hour
that god gives us 
and what about his lordship 
hoping for a peaceful end 
and suddenly he plunged
into a three ring circus 
well  i agree with daisy 
we will meet men and women
that we only see on the screen 
  it will be good for home 
  that s the thing 
  this money will make a difference 
  how much did they say 
it s none of your business 
if they talked 
  they didn t speak 
  well  good night 
  good evening 
  good night 
still  times change 
and we must change with them 
mrs  parker 
we should go home too 
very good  mr  parker 
let s go 
daisy is more obedient
with him than with me 
maybe he will make her happier 
well  i did my best 
a movie  in downton 
i know it seems unlikely 
but i m not sure
if it is that horrible 
i disagree 
rude and vulgar actors
and actresses
walking through the rooms
with his sticky fingers 
sitting on the chairs 
eating at the table where once
sat the king of england 
this smacks of the worst excesses
of the french revolution 
should we ask them to stand
stand and put gloves on them 
this is a fall  elsie 
it s a fall 
they are flirting
with the mafia 
but it will pay  charlie 
and they need the money 
with this argument  why
not open the place to the public
and have them poking and prodding
and poking around every corner 
we tried this once 
and i thought we had all
decided never again 
keep this up
and you will have a heart attack 
i would be better off out of it
if that s what it s come to 
andy  could you fold
this newspaper straight 
i will take him with me upstairs 
of course 
then a film will be made
in the big house 
what will this mean
for you 
  i can t say for sure 
  but it will be exciting 
see how a movie is made 
meet the stars 
i would stay away from them
if i were you 
i would stay away from everything 
i ll say good night  then 
  good evening 
  good night 
i forgot the newspaper 
after all 
memory of a mosquito 
good evening 
remember  it s his farm 
not ours 
it s lord grantham s 
he s just the tenant 
maybe  but don t say anything
that you will regret 
this is the problem 
and in the end  where will we be 
murray requested a translation
of the will 
apparently  montmirail
talks about an idyllic interlude
he spent with his mother
before getting married 
and what else does murray have to say 
it s strange 
the widow wants to fight
for the will 
but the son thinks he can
make an amicable agreement 
i would wire the mansion
and seal the windows 
he wants us to visit him there 
mom can t travel 
but asked to take
tom and lucy with us 
now that he knows that sybbie
must be the beneficiary 
what do you think 
good 
we could get to know
lucy better 
with luck  it means
we would lose
this whole terrible film
of mary s 
i found it  myrna dalgleish 
i knew i had one of her own 
her beauty is so classic 
i have one of his 
guy dexter in casanova 
just the thought makes me red 
he has something special 
like an animal
ready to jump 
jump on you  you say 
that s enough  andy and i will be
jealous if you don t take care of yourself 
i like that 
i hate to know that you will miss
all the fun 
i am nervous now about leaving
you alone with guy dexter 
the chances would be good 
  what do you think  bertie 
  a complication 
tom says they need to
bring maud bagshaw 
she is with them
until her house is ready 
we can stay in a hotel 
in that case  can we go 
  i would love to 
  wouldn t we get in the way 
  everyone goes  except me 
  i am 
i will do an article about people
who visit the south of france
in the summer 
are you writing again 
that s great 
edith returned to the magazine
two days a week 
what about little peter 
she has a wonderful nanny 
thank god 
can you really work
with two children
and take care of a house
like brancaster 
ask me in six months 
i am happy to know that you are
using your mind again 
we hope it is still there 
i will call montmirail tomorrow
to say that we will be
at the hotel 
i think he will be relieved 
come in 
i saw that the lights were still on 
were still on 
i suppose you agree with dad
that the idea of the film
is too banal
to be taken into consideration 
nothing is so banal if it will serve
to keep downton going 
we will have money
to redo the roof 
at the cost of a terrible month 
frankly  i believe
that it will be very terrible 
but seeing those buckets
collecting rainwater in the attic
is also terrible 
we went through the war 
we will go through it too 
but you must be firm  mary 
for these people  women
like us have two categories 
dragons and fools 
you have to make sure that they will see you
as a dragon 
mr  bates and mrs  baxter will take care of
of lord and lady grantham 
the rest will stay at downton
to help the people in the film 
i won t help anyone 
unlike
of ms  no fairy ness 
i would love to help 
may i be mrs  dalgleish s
of mrs  dalgleish s company 
i asked anna to do that 
i don t mean to be a pain  daisy 
but your job is here 
do we know if mrs  dalgleish
will stay in the house 
yes  it will stay with the director
and the protagonist 
the rest will stay in the mansion 
now i have to go
to see lady mary 
don t worry  daisy 
anna will find a way
to get you there 
i would trade it all in for a trip
to the south of france 
daisy 
i believe he
is opposed  milady 
and says that you must observe
and keep them under control 
i don t know if it will be of much help 
we need to get rid of it 
but how 
should i travel to france
with the others 
really 
she is worried that everything
is foreign to your lordship 
and neither mr  bates
or mrs  baxter
will have the authority to make sure
that everything is done right 
yes  i understand 
your lordship needs
you  charlie 
only you can show them
how things should be done 
don t worry about it 
they had better be warned 
the british are coming 
but what would i do with it 
and wouldn t it be an imposition
on the montmirails 
he wants to be useful to you 
papa  as he always has 
i could not show him
that he is of great help
just by being there 
i will  since you insist 
but it seems too
sentimental to me 
wait right here 
right  go after him 
british lion
cinematografia ltda
you two  come on  pull 
follow the closet  ma am 
give it to me 
it will show you where to take it 
  no  that s private 
  i understand 
over here  here it is 
excuse me  sir 
yes  please  that s it 
you are an angel 
hello  mr  molesley 
why are you here 
you know i love everything
that has to do with movies 
  i know you like to go to the movies 
  it is more than that 
for me  hollywood is
the real dream factory 
and i need dreams
as much as any man 
all this for one woman 
this is the closet
of mrs  dalgleish 
i know  it s so elegant 
no  do it the right way 
  sorry 
  nice and easy  guys 
continue  put it there 
thank you very much  here you go 
look where you tread 
you are here hiding
from the invaders 
sybbie  hello  dear 
what a pleasant surprise 
she came to stay with her cousins
while we are in france 
we talk about you 
about me  grandpa  why 
for numerous reasons  all good 
i present to you
miss dalgleish 
my father  lord grantham 
she is one of the stars
of our film 
i believe easily 
welcome to downton 
miss dalgleish 
the modern world comes to downton 
did you tell our host
that we will stay in a hotel 
he would not listen  he insists
to stay in the mansion 
even going to steal it 
he seems like a very nice guy
and has impeccable english 
which is more than can
be said of my french 
mr  guy dexter 
welcome  mr  dexter 
i am lord grantham 
this is my daughter 
lady mary talbot 
she will take care of you 
since we are going to the riviera 
but i hope you have fun here 
i would go with you if i could 
  are you english 
  yes 
i went to america ten years ago
to try my luck 
and i ve been there ever since 
i am not the only one 
they call us
the hollywood raj 
we play cricket
cricket once a week 
and the weather never stops playing 
do you know the south of france 
the last time there  i was left
on the roof of the negresco
with ronald colman
and gloria swanson 
  on the roof 
  you can tell us at dinner 
  when will they go 
  tomorrow 
dover  calais
and then the blue train to nice 
that sounds enviable 
  when will your director arrive 
  he will come for dinner 
don t you think so  myrna 
how would i know 
myrna dalgleish in this house 
it s amazing 
her father sold fruit
at the borough market 
now look at her 
a goddess of the screen 
and you will be her servant 
she brought
a mountain of luggage 
i thought that you and anna might
offer to unpack 
remember  you don t know
this woman 
she may not be the movie star
you see in the magazines 
well  there is only one way
to find out 
thank you 
lady grantham 
  i am sorry to bother you 
  not at all 
i made a new will
and i need you to witness
my signature 
i am exaggerating  it s just my
my jewelry and other pieces 
it s always a good idea to
to update these things 
murray was already down 
i thought i would take advantage of that 
i m glad you came 
because i wanted to tell you
that violet asked us
to look through her things 
what  why did she ask you 
i have no idea  but of course
that anything of interest
will be forwarded
to robert and you 
i just thought
you should know 
well  she wants to have her death
orderly and hassle free 
it has a lot to do with her 
  is it wrong to go to france 
  certainly not 
mary can send a telegram
if there is anything strange 
but there won t be 
i won t pretend that i ve always loved her 
but it will be strange 
and mary will be missed
when she is gone 
mary will become her 
then the gap will be filled 
now i have to go 
dinner is late
for being here 
  see you when we get back 
  of course 
she is right  it will be strange 
i will miss an opponent
to keep me in shape 
be careful with the clothes 
they are couture 
i need to help lady mary
and lady hexham to get dressed 
then i ll let daisy
unpacking 
i will come back when i am
dinner 
as long as you finish
and the trunks are already in the room 
what were you doing
on the roof of negresco 
it was a treasure hunt
and it needed a chimney 
but when we got there
they were big 
so we crushed and brought
all the pieces 
was the manager satisfied 
well  it was good publicity 
is there such a thing as good publicity 
it exists  if you are in the movies 
i suppose the russians
break their glasses
as a sign of good luck 
and now famous people break
other people s property
for good advertising 
is it true
miss dalgleish 
i don t do anything
unless i want to 
how great that sounds 
move the plate closer 
how did you become a movie actress 
a talent scout
discovered me 
because i am very beautiful 
it sounds wonderfully
romantic 
well  it s not so romantic 
not when you know that every man in the room
in the room wants you 
what a joyful life you lead 
have you made many films
traveling around the country 
i m afraid i m quite happy
to lose that 
i know you do it
just for the money  but that s okay 
what i never understand
is how you remember the lines 
well  it s not theater 
in fact  i don t even know
if the performance is adequate 
but won t that change 
haven t the movies started
to be talked about 
a few words here and there 
nothing scary 
who says 
bring me a crème de menthe 
would it be possible to remember
miss dalgleish 
that the servants work
hard in this house
and are doing their best 
they are not used
to rudeness 
she is not used to criticism 
your face on the screen sells
millions of tickets 
and she knows it 
i understood 
i took my first picture
when i was 20 
thank you 
i am the butler  sir 
please 
let me know if you need anything 
anything you need 
it seems like a very difficult task 
i m sorry 
i m teasing you 
what i must say is
i have everything i need 
thank you very much 
very good  sir 
put that book away 
charlie  and go to sleep 
let me finish this chapter 
you don t believe
what these people eat 
pardon 
  come on  carson 
  coming through 
let s run
before things get worse 
i hope you have
a mediterranean version
of this outfit or it will bake 
don t worry about me  my lord 
  you ll be fine  won t you 
  bye  daddy 
  take care of teo 
  of course 
have a great day 
no matter how it will be 
yes  we will do our best 
now  don t give me
with any scratches 
i found out 
in dealing with foreigners 
if someone speaks loudly and slowly
will bend to your will 
not too loud and not too slow 
no  no  andrew 
andrew  no  no 
thank you  bates 
we came to wish you good luck 
well  they just caught us 
as we set off
on our strange mission 
good 
what a pity that you will miss
the footage 
will you watch
while i am away 
i will try  if you let me 
try to have fun 
i don t need to say
the same for you 
please make johnnie
keep his nose clean 
it will be done  sir 
all aboard
or we will miss the train 
don t think i ve seen
so many beautiful ladies 
tea for miss dalgleish 
i just did 
daisy can take it 
i will take it  i want to take it 
no  let me take it  please 
lady mary won t mind 
i beg you 
calm down  daisy 
but i will get the tray later 
this one is for you 
miss dalgleish 
i never told you how exciting
to see you here 
i love your movies 
you are an inspiration to me 
since i watched
star crossed   
  can we move on 
  now 
everyone in the positions 
is she the actress 
roll the camera 
harry 
e    action 
you come down the stairs
and find him with your eyes 
you stop and move on 
but he is still waiting for you 
tell her she looks beautiful 
he is happy to hear that 
but you don t admit it 
look into his eyes 
will you let him kiss you 
it looks like you will 
wait  wait  who is he 
cut  cut  cut 
i am sorry 
wait  i can t act like this 
it s molesley 
he is very much appreciated here 
does it matter if he watches 
of course they don t mind 
they just don t want him there 
no  well noted 
so now you will do it all over again 
exactly 
i d rather make a living
on a mine 
first positions  please 
rotate the camera 
harry 
and    action 
go down the stairs 
surprised to find him there 
if i had known that we were going to stay
in the mansion  i don t know if i would come 
why not 
don t you think it might be
a little strange 
when we take ownership
the home of this family 
i don t know if this is the
sensible way to look at it 
i am glad that sybbie will be
in a similar situation as her cousins 
violet is giving her granddaughter away 
a great opportunity 
a real start in life 
her generosity
surprised you 
attila the hun
loved his family 
are you all right  mr  carson 
 well  is not the first thing
that comes to my mind 
i brought you a piece of cake 
mr  carson 
i think she sounded very rude 
i hope she is finished 
it is very difficult when
every film depends on you 
it depends on mr  dexter too
and he seems
much better to handle 
and it is so attractive 
hi  hi 
are you up to something 
if i were 
would i tell you 
mr  molesley
is in the movie now 
i didn t know where to stay 
let s leave the movie people
with their work
and we with ours 
listen to him  daisy  before you run away
to join the circus 
how are we all doing 
how do we survive 
right 
those cliffs
were pretty steep  weren t they 
well  shall we 
monsieur de montmirail 
lord grantham  bienvenu 
well  we came in a caravan 
we even brought our butler 
  i don t know why 
  but how chic 
now  come on in  everybody

and i would like a break 
i can imagine 
  welcome

mr  mason

i wanted to give the
to the young couple 
they are never left alone 
they always have to put up with me 
well  it is your home 
but i want them to feel
that it is their home 
so that when i hand over
the rent  they take over 
what are you going to do 
don t worry about me 
you already have your worries 
  i care about you 
  thank you 
the schedules for tomorrow
will be issued within one hour
and delivered to your accommodations
a good day 
it s always good if we stick to
the schedule 
what is it 
good news  i hope 
no  my husband is not coming back
when he said he would come back 
it must be a disappointment 
it is a disappointment 
but not a surprise 
seven thirty is too late 
i like to eat at seven 
it is difficult for the kitchen 
if we change
the usual schedules 
i would like to see
the magic of the stars 
well  one of her films
is being shown in thirsk 
  why don t we watch 
  i should say no 
why 
your family is not here 
you are your own mistress 
that s fine 
i ll let barrow know 
put on a coat
and tell grandma 
grandma  don t be angry 
but i m going to thirsk to see a movie 
alone 
with mr  barber  the director 
have you heard from
from henry lately 
he sent a telegram today 
he is not coming back yet 
denker  change of plans 
i m not going to get ready 
i want my dinner on a tray 
milady 
i am sorry 
it is not your fault
that miss dalgleish
has the charm of a wart 
mr  dexter is nice 
he can defend himself
without my help 
not interested in movies 
i watched a few 
i prefer to eat rocks 
in fact  i think i will
stay in my bed 
at least until everyone
leave 
should i worry 
florence nightingale crawled into
in bed at the age of 38 
she passed away at the age of 90 
you would tell me  wouldn t you 
what do you think 
go 
and you  lord grantham 
do you know the south of france 
i know that lord brougham
made it fashionable
in the 1830s
when he was chancellor 
so you are just recovering
what is rightfully yours 
i wouldn t say that  but i understand
why you are upset 
but here you are 
keeping an eye on the furniture 
measuring the curtains   
mom  please  we can
buy another country house 
we are here
because your son invited us 
but i would like to know why
your husband did this 
i have asked our lawyer
to come here in a few days 
i think it s an excellent idea 
until then  i hope you enjoy
the stay 
your butler brings an air of
of splendor to the proceedings 
but he can withdraw 
if he prefers 
why  the house already belongs
to your granddaughter 
lady bagshaw 
please 
come and sit here 
i am sorry 
i went to rest for five minutes 
i closed my eyes and blacked out 
welcome to the house of doves 
  you must come here a lot 
  yes  we do 
or rather  we were coming 
before you guys showed up 
always in winter 
as long as i can remember 
but now the fashion
is to come in the warmer months 
i will write an article
about it 
  are you a writer  lady hexham 
  i m more of a journalist 
i have a magazine
and i m going to take back control of it 
what is your article about 
scott fitzgerald 
zelda  coco chanel 
everyone who made the hotels
hotels stay open in july 
may i publish
some pictures of the mansion 
would that be possible 
of course 
if we can see the images
before using them 
clearly  she is not the first
journalist he has met 
tickets  please 
sold out
we will have to postpone
our appreciation
of miss dalgleish s exhibition
for another time 
this is not her film 
 the terror  is the first film
fully spoken film
to be shown here 
i thought it was
 the jazz singer  
in this one  al jolson speaks a few
words to his mother 
and he sings 
in this one  they talk
during the whole movie 
where is the rialto bridge 
take the next left
and park 
lady mary went to the movies
in thirsk with mr  barber 
and lady grantham is
eating in her room 
so mr  dexter
and miss dalgleish
will dine alone 
does mrs  patmore know about this 
you know 
we feel sorry for mr  dexter 
what happened 
wouldn t it be interesting
to you  mrs  hugues 
you may speak 
if you like 
during the royal visit 
do you remember a jack
named ellis 
i remember 
you became great friends 
i remember 
i received a letter from him
this morning
saying that he is going to get married 
is that sad 
i know it shouldn t be 
mr  barrow  your path
in this life
is very difficult 
most people
in your position
choose to hide
behind appearances
that allows them to avoid
persecution and rejection 
he certainly must not
be blamed for this 
it s not what i want 
mrs  hugues 
so you  sir  are a brave man 
are a brave man 
but it is also destined
to be lonely 
unless you are very lucky 
meet me at midnight
don t tell anyone
you said that her face
would sell a million tickets 
not in thirsk  apparently 
but it was right  of course 
she is very beautiful 
god save the king 
how wonderful 
i am still curious to know
why we are here 
if you went to england 
you would meet my mother 
which would make more sense 
i wanted to know you
more than lady grantham 
and your mother 
the situation is delicate for her 
but she will be fine 
i will make sure of it 
over there 
what is their game 
make us feel safe
and then sue us 
maybe they want to make us feel
feel guilty and give up the game 
i think that monsieur de montmirail
loved his father
and intends to accomplish
what he wants 
and we are here
representing grandma 
the mysterious figure
of it all 
bonjour  monsieur 
shine 
no 
coverage  legal 
yes 
carson 
can i help you 
i think that might be it 
you look like
king zog of albania 
é 
perfect 
no  no  no 
i won t allow that 
i chose it  so i pay 
yeah  but i m the one who s going to use it 
thank you  sir 
to both of them  you
and your wife 
if you were selling clothes
when he arrived in hollywood 
how did you get into the world
of films 
one day  i was asked to pose
for a newspaper
with a suit
that they were advertising
and an agent came
and signed me up 
since it is so beautiful 
i thought they liked
my talent as an actor 
girls  go change your clothes 
we want to go home 
now you know
why i am at the movies 
how did you become a butler 
it s far less glamorous 
i got a job as a lackey 
i was apprentice  first servant 
valet 
and  finally  butler 
i know all about running
a house  sir 
this is the difference
between you and me 
i don t know what i am doing
most of the time 
it is not what it seems 
thank you 
  sir
  just barrow  sir 
okay  guy 
let s rehearse  please 
myrna  your line 
i saved a cue for you 
i always think they look like
instruments of war 
that s because they are 
there is a phone call for you 
mr  bullock  he says it s urgent 
five minutes  people 
there is drama down there 
the man in charge was shouting
on the phone when i arrived 
it seems they are making the wrong
the wrong kind of film 
is there a right kind 
all i know is that it seems that the public
only wants movies that talk 
i thought the best thing about movies
is that you can t hear them 
it would be even better
if i couldn t see them too 
everyone  gather around  please 
everybody 
we are suspending production 
i know  i know 
i regret to be the bearer
of bad news 
we will contact you
when we run out of plans 
thank you 
what is it  what happened 
it seems that talking movies
are making a lot of money 
while our film is silent
and expensive to recover the costs 
so they want to cut their losses
and shut us down 
how sad 
it is worse for the men and women
who work at it 
we still owe the extras 
and now they are out of a job 
  i told you 
  excuse me 
myrna 
why is he stopping 
apparently  silent films
no longer make money 
i saw it one night 
the theater was almost empty 
what a shame 
i feel sorry for mr  barber 
he doesn t deserve that 
i wish i could help 
i wish i could too 
but i don t know how 
we are doing a mute 
they only want to launch spoken  so
why not turn it
into a talking movie 
what would this mean 
getting a coach from london 
he could record the sound
for scenes we already did and
and put new lines in the rest 
why wouldn t it work 
mr  mason
is driving me crazy 
all cups and saucers
need to be right 
you are his daughter in law 
his son died in the war 
no wonder he and i
don t get along 
it is a pity
that he is annoying you
because he is a lovely man 
and he likes you very much 
daisy 
didn t you have a crush on him
once 
about a hundred years ago 
i heard that a sound specialist
is coming from london 
don t remind me 
are you okay 
can i help you 
no one can help me now 
come on 
if it isn t just barrow 
sir 
i thought this big house
is much more interesting
than our silly movie 
don t call me  sir  
is there anything i can do 
unless you have ideas
for my next career 
i don t understand 
the movies were mimes
until now 
mimes with music 
now with the talking movies 
they will be about acting 
they won t want us 
they will hire real actors
from the theater and
we will be finished 
but you have a good voice 
there may be some new faces coming in 
but the public will not want to
to say goodbye to old favorites 
i hope you are right 
sir 
that is the yacht
of the duke of westminster 
let me summarize 
in the years after 1864 
the late marquis de montmirail
made four wills 
in each one  he refers to the fact
of having given the villa des colombes
to the then dowager countess
of grantham in 1865 
i brought the originals 
i ll leave copies 
so clearly
it was not something that was forgotten 
he intended this
and kept his decision 
i feel better for it 
she must have had
some power over him 
she must have blackmailed him 
maman  that is a silly answer 
we will challenge it in court 
based on what  madam 
you have other homes 
it s not about hardship 
her husband bought the mansion
and disposed of it before he met her 
my advice would be to hand over
the property without delay 
  thank you very much 
  do you intend to accept that 
of course  my father made me
sole executor  lord grantham 
i think he trusted me
to fulfill his desires 
then why did you invite us here 
i was curious to meet him 
my father and his mother
spent a week together
in october 1864 
and i was born in july 1865 
precisely 
i think that is the reason why
he gave her the mansion after a month 
in gratitude for his birth 
in other words 
i believe that you and i
have a lot in common 
we should thank
lady grantham 
of course 
now we know
that for her to have the villa
was not a random choice
or a foolish mistake 
but a decision firmly
supported for many years 
it s funny  in a way 
knowing that my daughter
is from the golden circle where 
because of his blood 
beautiful things happen 
just as mary will have downton
and we will have brompton 
but they are working
of work 
here was made
to laugh and have fun 
wouldn t sybil be happy
for her daughter 
and encouraged her to use
for the good of others 
yes  i think she would 
so let s do the same 
i look forward to bringing sybbie here 
she ll love it 
look at this view 
don t you feel grateful
that we are alive 
i love you  you know 
i thought i would never love
again 
and i love you 
so it s all good 
shall we go back  the water is
they seem
very happy together 
this is how it should be 
it s exciting for sybbie 
for all of them 
i like that tom and lucy have
a meeting here every summer 
until it became
a family tradition 
the sun made me sleepy 
if you ll excuse me  i m going to take
a nap before dinner 
you look tired too 
why don t you do the same 
i won t be long 
she is right 
you look tired 
i don t understand how it is useful
for people to say that 
i am sorry 
never stop writing 
mom 
if there is something bothering you 
please say so 
no  not at all  really 
i had to change the arrangement
of the dining table again 
but i think they got the hang of it
the way of passing
his lordship s shirts 
finally 
you should have let me do that 
you must be very grateful
for your help  mr  carson 
well  maybe  when i showed
them how to do this 
they spoke french
very loud and very fast 
is everything settled 
it seems that the mansion now
belongs to miss sybbie 
lucky girl 
do you envy her  ms  baxter 
i m not a big believer
in envy  mr  bates 
i know what i want 
and i can live without a mansion
in the south of france 
what do you want 
miss baxter 
please  mr  carson 
we all know what she wants 
your affections are
firmly committed 
they are not committed 
uncommitted
in that way  perhaps 
but completely taken 
are we talking about
mr  molesley 
we are 
but suppose
that he never takes action 
then i ll be an old maid 
you would never marry
to anyone else 
it took me a long time
to find him 
madam 
i don t know how long
he thought about it 
but he checked the dates 
he made sure 
i was born exactly nine
months later 
i mean  the  idyllic interlude 
they spent together 
and he gave the mansion
right after i was born 
i am sure that
that it is all a coincidence 
does it really 
that would explain the mystery 
your father loved you very much 
but it is rosamund
who looks like him 
i hope i have helped you  milady 
thank you  baxter 
  good evening 
  good night 
what s that for  what s up 
just a little heartburn  i m fine 
what will happen
if the story is released 
i suppose carson
will deliver his notice 
don t be ridiculous  you are the least
least french person i have ever met 
you don t even like garlic 
this is not exactly
proof of anything 
how did they do it
so fast 
because time is money 
the problem is 
what will the actors say 
what do you mean 
i write the lines for them 
but they don t always adhere to the text 
and sometimes we don t remember
what the actors say 
why not let
mr  molesley help 
why 
what can you do 
he is the principal of the school
of the mansion 
and i know that he can read lips 
he could help
in something 
this is really true 
and he was here every day
and watched every scene 
okay  mr  barber  i m ready 
bring in the actors 
that sounds
very professional  milady 
if you don t mind my saying so 
it is the new speed reflex 
you can see the image
before you take it down 
what will they think of next 
how are you doing down there 
all right  i guess  sir 
although they are very french 
the french  aren t they 
  i suppose they are obligated 
  i suppose they are 
poor things 
that s very good  but  carson 
could you take the phone out 
that spoils it a bit 
it is beautiful to see you
enjoying your work 
it s good to have a point   
support in the real world again 
something like that  yes 
my goodness 
what is it 
take a look 
who is she 
this is lady grantham 
who i started working for
like a young page
wet behind the ears 
grandma 
heavens 
thank you  carson 
could you give us a moment 
what does it say 
 violette  mon adorée  
my god 
mary had a little lamb 
his wool was white as snow 
okay  mr  stubbins 
are you ready 
as ready as i can be 
mr  barber  for i did not control
the sound insulation or the set 
call mr  dexter  please 
guy 
where are the lines 
i am sorry 
no  no 
  thank you 
  and here 
time the speech
to match the movie 
no  don t lean 
and try not to move your head 
very good 
ring the bell
to ask for silence 
e   
sound rolling 
 well  if it isn t lady anne 
i thought i could find myself 
nobody can keep a secret
a secret these days 
just a reminder
which is my future
for me to throw away 
no  wait 
don t go  
cut 
very good 
miss dalgleish 
ready 
and action 
 i knew where you would be 
i just came to    
hold on 
i turned my head there 
you    yes 
i wrote a
to cover this  see 
 i only came to stop you
from throwing away your future  
you    go back to the  future  
right 
and action 
 i knew where you would be 
i just came to stop
  who throws away his future 
  louder 
 i can t stay
and watch you ruin yourself 
  i must    
  cut 
thank you  myrna 
could you give me a minute 
are you okay 
what now  mr  stubbins 
i am here to record sound 
not to perform miracles 
lady anne erskine
that she is not 
couldn t she learn the accent
the accent and try again 
people try their whole
their whole lives and fail 
george b  shaw
wrote a play about it 
you could do it  milady 
you saw how mr  dexter did it 
it can t be that hard 
but i couldn t 
what  couldn t
do the accent 
i think it could 
i think it does 
  but i am not an actress 
  well  myrna is an actress 
looking forward to seeing
her hedda gabler 
even so 
look  just try 
if you don t succeed 
we will close forever 
if you can 
will allow us to continue 
please 
how do we deal
with miss dalgleish 
now  take her
back up 
  we need to see if it will work 
  i ll do it 
miss dalgleish 
  here are the lines  milady 
  thank you 
i don t know how i get into
into these things 
 i knew where you would be 
i only came to stop you
from throwing away your future 
i can t stay
and watch you ruin yourself 
i have to go  
and cut 
touch them together 
well  if it isn t lady anne 
i thought you might find me 
you can t keep
a secret these days 
i knew where you would be 
 i ve only come to stop you
from throwing away your future 
just a reminder
which is my future
for me to throw away 
i can t stay
and watch you ruin yourself 
no  wait 
don t go 
i have to go 
i hope it was
it was a prop 
when was it painted 
and why was she your beloved 
why did she grant
the final favor 
they were together only
a few days  does it seem likely 
and it s just a coincidence
that daddy was born
nine months later 
i imagine that 
when she got home 
your grandfather was very
happy to see her 
anyway 
monsieur de montmirail was
madly in love with her 
  when did he get married 
  i know that  i looked 
she married in 1870  five years
after robert s birth 
and the current marquis
was born in 1873 
so the mansion was a parting gift
of farewell
to his grandmother before
that he looked for a wife 
  that s what it looks like 
  evidently 
i will probe it 
  about mrs  patmore 
  you can t 
i can 
you know that she
has a house of her own 
you know she is lonely 
it is a solution for all of us 
they sound very conspiratorial 
we talked about mrs  patmore
and how much she likes you 
does she really like it 
well  i like her 
  she is a good woman 
  she is 
but sometimes i worry
that i m lonely 
he has his own house  of course 
but i think i would like
to have company there 
i know what you are thinking 
but the answer is no 
you always said
that you admired her 
and i admire it 
but i wouldn t live off her 
it wouldn t be right 
  even if she wanted to 
  even then 
there are things that are right
and there are things that are wrong 
and i can t change that 
thank you for accepting 
i owe you a lot 
  is everything in order 
  well   
once we record the sound
of the scenes we ve already shot 
we will need new material
for what is missing   
may i speak  mr  barber 
of course 
i went through all
the dialogue letters
that would be shown
if the image were silent 
and started sketching scenes
that would cover the needs
needs of the plot 
  have you written a play 
  well  i started one 
  could i read these scenes 
  of course 
and if you are satisfied 
i ll do the rest 
am i limited
by the plot synopsis 
for example 
when she finally rejects him 
wouldn t it be better
with a big romantic climax 
i don t understand 
bill benson is about to
to throw his life away 
alone  empty and without hope 
suddenly he raises his face
and sees anne standing there 
tall  serene  graceful 
her eyes shining
with unshed tears 
on an impulse 
he takes his money back 
rien ne va plus 
the wheel spins 
and everything he has
would be gone 
but  no 
her love  her beauty
saved him 
she takes his hand 
and they leave 
together 
end 
i think i m going to cry 
mr  molesley  please 
finish the script
as you see fit
  and bring it to me 
  right 
  you said he worked here 
  yes 
he was a servant 
but we didn t know
of his hidden talents 
poor carson 
you must be cooking
in these clothes 
isn t there a lighter model
model that he can use 
  i believe so 
  thank you  monsieur 
but we english 
don t get hot
by wearing the correct attire 
i invited some friends over tomorrow
to say goodbye
and introduce you 
but the presence of your butler
reminds me
that we are your guests
and i should have asked 
please 
here s to your fortunate granddaughter 
sybil branson 
  to sybbie 
  sybbie 
i wish she were here
to meet her 
i hope you will meet her one day 
she is lovely 
it s good to hear a stepmother
talk like this 
you must be happy
the way things are 
when the ones you love are lucky 
is almost better than being lucky 
almost  but not quite 
yes 
do you know the miniatures
in the library 
one of them is grandma s 
and it is engraved on the side 
i ve seen it 
i was forced to see her there
for more than half a century 
but he forbade me to take it off 
he made me swear 
any more news
from mr  talbot 
not since the phone call
i told you about 
you must miss him 
milady 
i just hope he feels my
his lordship
will soon be home 
i m afraid he will have a shock 
did you enjoy the filming 
in a way 
i liked mr  barber
and mr  dexter
and see how a film is made 
but   
i was a little
disappointed as well 
for miss dalgleish 
it sounds silly  but i thought
that we would become friends 
they say it is a mistake to meet
their favorite stars 
in this case  they are right 
are you happy 
i am 
but there is work to be done 
the harder you work 
the happier you will be 
well  you already know me 
and  yes  i want to enjoy
sybbie s luck 
  i want us all to enjoy it 
  congratulations  tom 
you are a leopard who has changed
your spots successfully 
he is very fast 
no 
where is the ball  it is gone 
good move 
that s it  how about it 
george should be in bed 
or at least on his way 
do you have other children 
a daughter  caroline 
with my second husband 
george s father died in a car accident
car accident seven years ago 
the day george was born 
he held the baby in his lap
and died on the way home 
my god 
what was he like 
it was perfect  really 
beautiful like a prince
from a fairy tale 
moralistic  strong  with dreams 
determined to do his part 
  do you miss him 
  of course 
although i wonder
what life would have made of him
if he had lived 
in a way   
one way 
i was going to say  in a way 
that you remind me of him 
although i cannot say
why 
i am flattered 
what about your current husband 
henry is more pragmatic 
there are no dreams about him 
he is an executioner 
it tests your endurance
from morning until night 
but he is a good co worker 
is he handsome too 
yes 
i like the pretty ones 
but is there trouble in paradise 
you don t need me to tell you 
marriage is a soap opera 
not a short story 
full of twists and turns 
suppose it all boils down to
whether you love him or not 
really  mr  barber 
it s because working on the movies 
i think i have counted enough
for one night 
i hope you warmly welcome
our successors to the mansion 
and with the bransons  perhaps
you will see lord grantham 
who i think i can call
my good friend 
he handled everything
with such good manners
because he thinks he is my brother 
for a moment 
i thought you were going to speak 
you can t talk like that 
your father loved you  that s enough 
but it s not enough  is it 
not when i could be
a fraud throughout life 
a frenchman who stole the role
of the proper heir 
but that would be matthew s father 
and now his son
who will inherit 
then what difference does it make
in the long run 
i m afraid it s a real
blow to daddy
discover that you may
be an impostor 
if it s true 
he will be devastated 
maman 
you know  i liked seeing
you working here 
i got a preview
of what you are missing 
i don t think i m ready
to say goodbye to this
part of my life 
i looked at the miniature 
lady hexham  and  you are right 
the matter is settled 
please take it to your grandmother 
it s hers anyway 
just a moment  please 
what is it 
whatever your secret is 
is not a good time
to share with daddy 
yes  nothing compares to the sea 
that one was beautiful  it was   
you have been so kind 
but it s time to go home 
we will too  soon 
as you know  the contents of the house
already belongs to your mother 
you should take what you want 
no  his wishes were clear 
our lawyers
can manage the rest 
i know it s late 
but can we walk 
yes  of course 
monsieur 
we are indebted to you 
thank you 
  madame 
  thank you 
why didn t you tell me before 
i was  and suddenly
we were coming here 
but you never
should have come here 
we have to get her to a doctor 
not some quack in marseilles 
dr  clarkson is able
of presenting a diagnosis 
we will go to london 
we will go to america  if you need us 
  we ll discuss it better later 
  you should have told me 
with the chance of disease
take over our lives 
it can t be that bad 
robert  i run a hospital 
do you think i just sat there
and heard nothing 
no  no  no  no 
no  no 
that s not what i want 
we are not sad people 
the fact that i am sick now
does not make us sad 
oh my gosh  my   
losing my mother and my name 
can i lose you too 
  i can t take it 
  if i can take it  you can 
remember
that i love you from the beginning 
i loved him before he loved me 
i was always ashamed of it 
don t have  i had money 
you needed it 
and then came love 
and we are happy  aren t we 
hon 
you are everything to me 
all 
and i hope to be everything
for a while yet 
now   
we must start early tomorrow
and it s past
past my bedtime 
hon 
i hope we can get passage
for the blue train 
why is the camera
in a padded case 
anyone would think
to be a lunatic 
it is certainly unpredictable 
the microphone cannot pick up
any noise
unless i approve 
the padded box contains
the sound of the camera running 
so we are really
in your hands  mr  stubbins 
your words  not mine 
everybody ready 
let s go for a take 
  e   
  be aware
from where the microphones are
and speak clearly 
and this time  myrna 
mime  but don t speak 
  no word  right 
  i m not an idiot 
  we just want to hear from lady mary 
  mary  please 
very good 
albert  is the clapperboard ready 
ring the bell 
roll the camera 
albert 
e   
action 
madame  messieurs 
placez vos paris 
bill 
you are back 
  i always come back 
  sorry 
  cut 
  sorry

to the beginning  please 
roll the camera 
and    action 
madame  messieurs 
placez vos paris 
bill

it s hard for me because
she is right in my ear 
  and he caught me walking out of there 
  i understand 
restart  please 
bill 
you are back 
  i always come back 
  holy shit 
  no need to swear 
  myrna  i m sorry 
  that s enough 
  myrna 
get your hands off me 
get out of my way 
  myrna  darling 
  no 
what now 
i knew she would be
a problem from the start 
she is rude  crude 
fact  but now she
also feels humiliated 
moving her mouth as
lady mary s voice comes out of it 
and this is his
first sound film 
what will happen to her 
i guess her career
is over 
i suppose for many it is over 
the point is that they
have to bring her back 
but what if she doesn t come 
they can t force her 
why don t you two go 
you know how to talk to her 
they don t 
myrna  dear 
please come down 
we can t do anything without you 
you can talk without me 
just go away 
milady 
i think it is a good idea
to let the maids
see if you can make her
comfortable  mr  barber 
if you think so  yes 
stand back  everyone 
may we
come in  miss dalgleish 
we understand
what you are going through 
this is true 
and you know it 
i m not going out just to
humiliate me and laugh at me 
they won t do that 
you should hear them at the premieres 
 don t speak  don t open your mouth  
they despise me 
why didn t you take
diction classes  lots of people do 
i tried  i couldn t 
i didn t get it right 
something has been bothering you
since you got here 
  what is it 
  that s it 
i knew it was over
as soon as i saw the jazz singer 
it looks like a sword
hanging over me 
i thought i would have a few more
films  but this will be the last 
you don t know that 
it was fine as far as i could see 
and how do i look 
the fact is that i am finished 
as the yanks say 
i am a thing of the past 
let s go  ma am 
you are not talking
with your fan club right now 
what 
you are famous  beautiful and rich 
so what if your career
in cinema is over 
there are other things
you can do 
now  pull yourself together 
in the meantime  try to be polite
polite with people 
come on  daisy 
you are one of us 
not like them 
just remember that 
now  let s go 
fix your hair
and let s go 
how are you doing there 
she s almost ready 
mr  barber 
you are  aren t you 
miss dalgleish 
i had a sister like you 
i miss her  every single day 
you remind me of her 
she died of
flu in 1919 
i didn t think it would touch our family  but
family  but you never know 
let s go 
i m not worth it 
you are worth it to me 
rien ne va plus 
it seems that you
are my savior 
and i intend to continue as your
your savior for a long time to come 
mary 
what the hell is going on 
  cut 
  no 
so you put them in place 
i think i can say that
without fear of contradiction 
i did not leave them in doubt
how to do things
things correctly 
mr  bates 
you made
your feelings clear 
they learned how to deal
with an english butler 
get your coats 
watching you 
i remembered the pieces
that the three of them were doing in the attic 
except that there is a lot
more to it this time 
i don t want to be harsh 
but how do we know she s good 
she is absolutely superb 
i showed the telegram
from daddy to grandma 
tom 
you should take a look 
we can go up now 
you are right 
it must be you 
you can give her the thumbnail 
what is this miniature 
it is a long story 
talkies are good news for west end
for west end actors 
good news for them 
bad news for me 
death by microphone  isn t it  guy 
our business has always
been a game of chance 
well said 
i have an idea 
miss dalgleish 
that can help 
i will take your mother
to the hospital first thing in the morning 
i am apprehensive  of course 
but this is for you
to hear  not for her 
i thought they
could fight more 
so do we 
mom wanted it 
and then edith
found this 
there is something written next to it 
i    i think they think
that something improper
happened between us 
  i believe everyone thinks 
  no 
i wouldn t say that 
you are a terrible
liar  tom 
i would never get anywhere
if i was a liar like you 
we will try to meet
at the mansion every year 
the whole family together 
in the summer 
won t it be too hot 
we hope you
come and find out 
no 
no  that s over for me 
never mind 
i am happy to have
met you  tom 
i think that in the end 
we got along pretty well  didn t we 
i think so 
in the end 
you were not what we had
in mind for sybil 
but we overcame it 
and that s life  isn t it 
overcoming the unexpected 
and maybe learning from it 
what i think we can say
say we did 
you have been my good friend
over the years  violet 
i hope it was for you 
and now you are settled 
maud is back in the family
and everyone is happy 
when was the miniature painted 
did you pose for this 
no  we    we
we went for a walk in the city one day 
and there was a store where a man
was taking pictures 
yes  i remember because
he was the first photographer
i had already seen it 
they must have copied from that 
montmirail sent me to london
with a silly  scribbled letter 
i sent it back 
of course  i should have burned it 
we will let you rest 
but we wanted to say
how grateful we are 
and sybbie will be too 
it is a beautiful place 
this i remember 
time for bed 
yes  i ll just fix that 
what are they 
the letters
from monsieur de montmirail 
are they well named 
i m afraid so 
so she lied when she said
that she didn t remember 
 lying  would be heavy 
maybe i forgot a little 
i can t believe you didn t remember
everything that happened 
i will ask when i go to see her 
is this the way i find
mr  barrow 
left 
so this is where it hides 
is there anything i can
with anything  sir 
well  start by not calling me  sir 
 sir  
i m not sure
what mr  carson would think 
if i were to receive a guest
from upstairs  mr  dexter 
well  mr  carson is not
in charge now 
you are 
suppose someone walks in 
what would they say 
i don t mind 
i have lived in america for ten years 
i don t believe
these things anymore 
please  call me guy 
what is your real name 
quentin 
quentin sidebotham 
that was a good decision 
do you know what you will do next 
i don t think anyone knows 
i will go home and wait for
the events 
you could call clive brook
or charlie chaplin 
see what they think 
do you know charlie chaplin 
a little wild
for me  but yes  i know him 
hollywood has a bad
publicity 
but i live in a place called
hancock park 
and it s pretty cool 
i believe 
well  why don t you come
and see for yourself 
what 
i mean 
i travel a lot for work and   
i don t have a wife
to take care of me  so   
you could take care of 
would i be your jack 
more than that 
you would manage the house
and organize our trips 
make me comfortable 
it would make us both comfortable 
if my career is over 
we will have to rethink 
your career will not end 
good 
well   
let me know when you have    
reached a decision 
right 
i have everything i need 
i will go to the house
with the results
as soon as you have them 
but do you feel optimistic 
robert  you don t need
this kind of talk 
lady grantham understands too much
to pretend she doesn t 
but even though everything
may seem bad 
there is still a surgery 
let s take it one step at a time 
my goodness 
robert doesn t see it  but things
could be much worse 
how many face these things
wasting their lives 
i don t 
no way 
how are things at the farm 
tight 
poor mr  mason 
he would be so unhappy
to hear you say that 
he has been talking
about you lately 
really 
saying what a beautiful woman
you are and how much he admires you 
him  really 
but he will not
take it any further 
why not 
because he can t ask
you to live on the farm
and cannot be
dependent on a woman 
can t he 
we will see about that 
here s what we found 
when i was going through
violet s things 
the letters
of the marquis of montmirail 
wow  it doesn t look
good for dad 
if she had to
to keep this a secret 
well  let s not hurry 
  i m sorry  did they say anything 
  no  no 
  can i talk to you alone 
  yes 
so what happens now 
well  i thought we could
read them together 
bertie  you and i can do
this and report what s in it 
and let s break the news to daddy 
what happened 
you have to help me 
we are about to shoot
our last act 
the dinner when benson
realizes that he must give up on her
and runs to london 
i know  i just learned 
molesley did
a wonderful job 
i said that the extras were
tired of not being paid 
and i don t blame them  but i m still waiting for the money 
i m still waiting for the money 
they re not going to do
anything too drastic  are they 
they say they won t work 
but how can i help 
can your servants help 
you can ask them 
there is something else 
mr  barber 
i would never have gone through
through any of this without you 
if this is true 
then i am happy 
can i kiss you 
no 
don t you want to 
i m afraid i m
too old fashioned to believe
that what i want is the
only thing that matters 
  have i offended you 
  not at all 
nothing is more pleasant
for a married woman 
than to discover that she
is still an object of desire 
better not tell your husband
when he returns  he might 
hit me on the nose 
wouldn t that be exciting 
two beautiful men
fighting for my favors 
you called  milady 
  did she keep his letters 
  apparently all of them 
i will not ask what you have hidden 
if you tell me the answer 
most of them
are quite sad 
there was clearly no love
between him and his wife 
but what do they say about
the days you spent in france 
i m afraid they didn t
corresponded at the time 
so we still have no proof
of what really happened 
i suppose that s where
where the mystery lies 
i m going to see violet tomorrow 
should i go 
no 
you are what lawyers call
an  interested party  
i don t 
meaning that we would be
up there on the screen
with miss dalgleish
and mr  dexter 
  are you sure 
  that s what i mean 
i will do it 
so will mr  carson 
mr  molesley will
want to participate 
  how many do you need 
  we need ten 
  mrs  denker  would you like it 
  maybe not 
i want to keep an eye
on his lordship 
what about mr  mason 
you might ask 
run to the farm
and ask him 
and do they have clothes for us 
they will need time
to adjust 
come up for a taste
at the end of the day 
we are created 
who will wait for us 
i was thinking
we could use albert 
would you be serving
miss dalgleish 
i think so 
well    okay  let s
back to work  please 
all right  let s go 
filming must be the slowest
slowest occupation known to man 
it makes a glacier
look impatient 
i suppose robert
is in hell 
he was wishing it would all
would be over when they returned 
you can ease
his pain if you want 
we find the letters
of monsieur de montmirail 
but robert still doesn t have
the answer he needs 
i won t pretend
that i don t understand you 
did they talk about the miniature 
what is its meaning 
well  could you get it 
it is in the bottom right drawer 
opening  at the back 
you will find the letter
he sent with it 
it is still there after
after all this time 
could you read it 
 chère violette 
we missed the chance
to know perfect love 
but we still can 
if you just change your mind  
why didn t you just
not tell us 
there was nothing to tell 
nothing happened 
besides years of being harassed 
well  no 
this is not
totally correct 
so what is it 
i never saw him after that 
i knew i would have given in 
if i had been tempted
again  i would have failed 
i was a fool for love
back then 
a few years later 
we went to russia 
and i got myself
in terrible trouble 
well  i almost did 
with prince kuragin 
yes  i know 
how did you avoid this
with the marquis 
i can t imagine 
he was the most attractive man
i have ever met in my life 
but i was newly married 
and it would have been a shame  you know 
to spoil that 
i wish you had 
i didn t want you to think
that my life was a fraud 
why it wasn t 
i was happy
with robert s father 
well    happy enough 
in that english way 
when    you never speak
about anything 
but trust each other 
if they had put
kuragin and montmirail together 
i would have come out as a
sort of scarlet woman 
you don t look
very scarlet 
well  i am trusting
in you to be sure
that this is not how
that i will be remembered 
well  the next earl
will be matthew s son 
my grandson  your great grandson 
i will do my best
to make him value his name 
i know it will 
i know i can trust you
to do the right thing 
this is very generous
on your part 
because we had
our fights  you and i 
well  that s true  but i m glad
that you came to downton 
i have never met anyone
in whose opinion
i could trust 
be morally correct 
not for years 
well  not since
since my mother died 
you must have asked yourself
why i asked you
to examine my papers 
i wondered 
when i think of that world
of long ago 
when i    i was a girl
in my first crinoline
in those moments 
i feel as if i had been
transported
to a different planet 
and so you have been 
like every human being
who lives long enough 
and i have  lived a lot 
i didn t mean that 
i m sorry  but i
could not wait 
everything is fine  nothing happened 
you are your father s son 
i can t pretend
that i am not relieved 
i can t pretend
that i am not insulted 
why do you think
he gave you the mansion 
if it has nothing to do
with my birth 
i think it had everything to do
with his birth 
when you were born
sent a message
that what he wanted
would never happen
and it was time to move on 
he never loved his wife
as he loved you 
the mansion is proof of this 
well   
it s not for me to say 
right 
i looked at the final scenes 
i am impressed 
this kind of work appeals to you 
writing plays for the screen 
  what  you mean   
  say  four a year 
i would send you the book or short story
that i am interested
with my notes and suggestions 
i would pay 700 guineas
up to a thousand 
  mr  barber 
  what 
i would earn 700
for writing the script 
it would rise to a thousand
if the film is made 
for each route 
i feel like the queen 
i don t envy you
if you need to wear these corsets 
  this is absurd 
  cheer up 
after all  you must be
used to the costume 
we put the names in the places 
so  please 
find your chair and sit down 
mr  carson  you will play
lord pumphrey 
at the end of the table 
it feels strange
to be sitting here 
you have spent too much time standing 
i would say that you
spent enough time 
you may be right 
mr  dexter 
tell me  does your offer mean
what i think it means 
it can mean
whatever you want 
i would like
that it meant a lot 
then you are in luck 
  mrs  hughes 
  thank you 
you are here 
i don t even recognize you 
e   
no  not really 
please  we are not here 
my lord  if you could go
behind the camera 
thank you 
i look like something
to scare crows 
nonsense  you are
the image of elegance 
now  sit down here
and have something to warm you up 
i thought it was
just colored water 
for others it really is 
to us 
i smuggled in something cool 
you are right  this is good 
doesn t the young couple
look good together 
it must be wonderful to feel
that you are helping 
i would like to do more 
well  that s what
that i want to talk to you about 
aren t you nervous 
how a man should feel
when all your dreams
come true 
all your dreams 
i know 
  but you see  miss baxter   
  phyllis 
phyllis 
i felt ashamed 
the best i could offer
it was a poor life
on a teacher s salary 
i would have accepted it 
but now  you won t have to 
i will write plays
to be made into movies 
for mr  barber 
for him now  but who knows
what will happen if i do well 
it s going to be talking movies
from now on 
what is this drug 
for the first time 
i can offer
a decent and prosperous life 
for both of us 
so  what do you say 
won t you kneel down 
  do you want me to kneel 
  i think so 
it won t happen again 
okay  so   
you want to marry me 
miss baxter 
i mean  phyllis 
yes 
i accept very happily 
mr  molesley 
congratulations  dear 
very good  mr  molesley 
very good  mr  molesley 
please calm down 
let s go to the first take 
say that again 
barkis is willing 
mr  mason 
and you will be content
to live in my little house 
unless you think it is wrong 
i certainly don t think so 
the younger ones
can keep the farm 
i will turn in the lease 
well  i ll drink to that 
  okay  and if we can   
  remember 
clarity  diction
and keep your head still 
  thank you 
  thank you 
prepare the camera 
and action 
where are you going 
back to london 
what  you can t 
i can and i must 
if i stay  dear anne 
i will destroy you along with me 
can t you see 
  let s fight together 
  no  we won t 
i am the useless one  i am the exile 
i am the lost soul 
now  let me go 
bill  please wait 
he broke her heart 
chap is a cheapskate 
and cut 
bravo 
bravo 
the buffet in the lounge is ready 
milady 
thank you  barrow 
milady  could i speak with you 
of course 
i would like to hand in
my notice 
i know that you
have not always been happy here 
it is not that  milady 
i had good years at downton 
but i formed a kind of   
i m not sure what it is 
really 
a working friendship
with mr  dexter 
  with guy 
  that s right  milady 
and we intend to travel together 
he will make movies
and i will take care of him 
i m going to be his agent 
as the movie people say 
and if i am right   
is the closest i have come
the offer
of an honest way of life 
no need to explain  barrow 
i wish you all the best 
and i hope you will be as happy
as our cruel world leaves you 
thank you  milady 
so what 
it is done 
great 
i want to know if you will miss
your acting career 
say yes  come to london
and we ll give you a part 
no  thank you 
i liked it  really 
but once is enough 
i can help you 
miss dalgleish 
i would love
some of this ham 
if you can reach it 
and a little sauce 
what happened to your voice 
  what do you mean 
  you missed the horrible   
of course  i didn t mean  horrible  exactly 
exactly 
she is a born talent 
lady grantham
do you think i can go to hollywood
and be an american 
why don t you go 
agree with me  bertie 
will you excuse me 
i just want to go downstairs 
thank you 
why is she so cool 
all of a sudden 
it is simple 
she is no longer afraid 
do you know that i am
completely crazy about you 
dear mr  barber
i can t give you
what you want 
but i can say that i loved
working with you 
and i should be content with that 
that s all you re going to get 
i am happy as my father s son
because i loved him 
it matters more to me
than all dynastic things 
it should be just like that 
i am happy for sybbie 
as long as she learns to give back 
don t believe in the idle rich 
i believe in them 
i just don t want
my family to be one 
that sounds good to me 
i ll have another cup 
excuse me 
does this include any future members
of your family 
yes  of course  because   
it s early 
so don t say anything yet 
my dear 
i won t say anything 
but i think i can kiss you 
dr  clarkson has arrived  my lord 
i notice that you are very friendly
with the handsome mr  barber 
don t start 
i stayed out of trouble
and i ve been good 
with some difficulties 
i must add 
it is not what you were afraid of 
pernicious anemia is often confused
confused with cancer 
and even a few years ago
it could have ended with you 
but now there is treatment 
thank god 
it will not be
particularly pleasant 
but you will get better
and you won t die 
well  thank you  dr  clarkson 
thank you very  very  very much 
yes  thank you 
now  you must come in
for dinner 
but it will be every man for himself
that night 
all created
are movie stars now 
we will never bring them
through the servants  wing 
milorde 
milady  come quickly 
please hurry 
doctor 
speak again 
speak in that voice 
i just want to say
how grateful i am 
you both helped me
when i needed it 
  thank you 
  are you going to hollywood now 
why not  i have no family
holding me here 
and i ve made a talking movie now 
which puts me in the forefront 
just don t forget who you are
and not even where you came from 
but also don t let
let it stop you either 
and good luck 
come here 
old lady grantham
is sinking very fast 
they are up there with her now 
grab a coffee or something stronger
just in case 
charlie  are you okay 
what did king lear say 
 winds  blow away
the very cheeks 
rage  blow hard 
trumpets and cataracts  
the moment of her departure
finally arrived 
that such a great lady
must depart
when the house is full
of moviegoers 
maud 
what are you doing here 
you won t believe me 
but i will miss you 
or did you come just to check
if i ve already gone 
do you want something 
whatever i wanted 
sweet boy 
you gave me long before
and over and over again 
dear mama  i hope i have not been
have been a disappointment 
you have always been smarter
than me 
true 
but don t let this
come between us now 
you are much kinder
than i ever was 
cora  i owe you an apology 
i didn t think you would last 
i know 
but i was wrong 
this is something that you
have never heard me say before 
it was worth the wait 
mary  dear  and edith 
you were wonderful granddaughters 
and i leave you two 
confident that your lives
will be happy and fruitful 
grandma 
dear grandma 
well  that should be enough 
or will i be like one
of those guests
who put their bags in the car
and never leave 
milady 
stop that noise 
i can t hear myself die 
take that too 
thank you  bates 
strange day
for you and for me 
we are orphans at last 
  good morning 
  good morning 
milady 
she would be so happy
with you here 
i remember the first time
i really saw you  milady 
up close  i mean 
i had just been
promoted
and was in the dining room
with the old butler 
mr  mountjoy 
i was terrified of him 
but then
she came towards us 
she was angry
at something 
and i could see him trembling 
i never forgot that 
and never again
was i ever afraid of him again 
you belong to our history 
in fact  i wonder
if your part is already over 
would you consider coming back 
for a little while longer 
milady 
barrow is leaving 
and i cannot train
a new butler by myself 
andrew could be
his right hand man
while you train him
to succeed you 
do you think he could handle it 
well  certainly 
in time 
his lordship s brooch 
so now  the torch
of downton has passed to you 
for my father 
but if i m going to carry it too 
i will try to do it with pride 
i cannot pretend that i am not
scared 
you don t have to be 
you have the strength 
do i 
sometimes i have doubts 
well  i don t 
not for a moment 
and you can always count on me 
if it means anything 
it means a lot 
and i think you know 
now i just need some time
before we go 
milady 
what did she have to say 
she wants me back home 
as a butler 
does she really want to 
we have to go 
thank you for organizing this 
she left the instructions
in minute detail 
i can imagine 
you will bury me one day 
and i am happy to see
that it will be well done 
i suppose the point is 
crawleys come and go 
but the family continues 
mom knew this
and believed it 
not only her 
let s go inside 
here they are 
andy
