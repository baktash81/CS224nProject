you four in you go
you five youll be aloof
and you two why not

are just born with them
so how do they get to earth then
well they use the earth portal
once they get a complete personality
of course
hello hello

hello there mentors
im jerry a counselor here
at the you seminar
now you dont remember it
but youve been here before
but dont worry
forgetting the trauma of childbirth
is one of the great gifts of the universe
here at the you seminar
all new souls are given unique
and individual personalities
im an agreeable skeptic
whos cautious yet flamboyant
im an irritable wallflower
whos dangerously curious
im a manipulative megalomaniac
whos intensely opportunistic
ho this one might be a handful
but thats earths problem
youll notice these souls
are all missing something
what goes in this spot
well these souls need their spark
and thats where you come in
maybe you will find their spark
in the hall of everything
where literally anything
on earth could inspire
or perhaps youll prefer the hall of you
featuring a selection of moments
from your own inspiring life
and just what is this spark
i know youre all excited to get to work
so good luck finding the spark
find the spark

black improvisational music
its one of our great contributions
to american culture
at least give it a chance joey
this is where it all started
this is the moment where
i fell in love with jazz
listen to that
see the tune is just an excuse
to bring out the you
and thats why i became a jazz musician
its not what were looking for
wait a minute thats not how
i remember it going down
come back when you have something
sorry joe
sorry joe
were looking
for something different
two three four
my life was meaningless
no no no

unless it becomes an earth pass
im stuck with it
well what if i help you
turn it into an earth pass
will you give it to me then
wait
ive never thought of that
id get to skip life
so yes
but we gotta get
this thing to change first
and ive never been able
to get it to change
come on
i know all about sparks
because mine is piano

no not jazz just music
i dont like music sounds
it feels like a little too much
well im not going out like this
wheres that hall of everything
ill be right back
dont get ahead of yourself pal
by the way why do you sound
like a middleaged white lady
i dont
this is all an illusion
this whole place is a hypothetical
i could sound
like this if i wanted to
or sound like this instead
i could even sound like you
life is so unfair
i dont wanna die
somebody call the wambulance wah
i just use this voice
because it annoys people
its very effective
dont worry theyre fine
you cant crush a soul here
thats what life on earth is for
very witty

where are your bodies
well on earth of course
my body is in a trance in palawan

im a nobody get it
we mystics meet in this glorious landscape
every tuesday
so many of them sad
you know
lost souls are not that different
from those in the zone

the zone is enjoyable
but when that joy becomes an obsession
one becomes disconnected from life
gotta find it
gotta find it gotta find it
for a time i was a lost soul myself
really
tetris
there you are
well have you back in no time
now since you dont have
a connection to your body
you will have to tune back
into your physical surroundings
close your eyes
breathe into your crown chakra
do we really need all this
yes
do you have a piano on board
i could focus with that
no pianos joe you must focus
imagine silence
shh
now concentrate on where your body is
listen for cues

no peeking
maintain your meditative state
or youll break the connection

moonwind listen
i gotta get out of here and back in there
well well have to perform
an oldfashioned astral
transmigration displacement
a what
its simply a way
to get your souls back where they belong
and its a glorious ritual indeed
full of chanting dancing
and best of all bongos
i need to be at the half note by 700
so this needs to happen right now
whoa whoa whoa not so fast
you must wait for another thin spot
to open between earth
and the astral plane
and that wont occur
until orcus moves
into the house of gemini
when is that
well the government calls it 630
look ill meet you at the half note
630 you serious
ill gather all
the necessary provisions
i said get out of here go

i can barely fit into my pants as it is
630 is cutting it close too close
we gotta get back to my place

man this would be hard
even if i wasnt wearing a hospital gown
go go go
just run to that one

i just gotta get back in my body
and really bring it tonight
how come this part is stinky
but this part smells fine

sheesh i cant believe ive been
walking around in this city

dorothea freaked out when she saw you

good now lets go
check out that suit
i came to tell you that i quit
quit
we dont have time for this
the suit is in the closet
band is a stupid waste of time
this kid is talking sense
what are you doing
here i quit
i think jazz is pointless
yeah jazz is definitely pointless
hey
in fact all of school is a waste of time
of course like my mentor
george orwell used to say
state sponsored education
is like the rattling of a stick
inside a swill bucket
yeah
the ruling classs core
curriculum stifles dissent
its the oldest trick in the book
what are you talkin about
she doesnt care about any of that
ive been saying that
since the third grade
you know you seem really smart
what is your position on pizza
i like it
me too
what are you doing
id rather hang with connie
what come back here
you open this
um i think your cat wants to get out
he thinks he knows everything
22 dont you walk away from me
come here right now
im gonna go in
and imma scratch up the sofa
wait a minute thats my sofa
you really got things figured out connie
id better give this back
it belongs to the school
sure
you know i really am glad
theres someone else
who sees how ridiculous this place is
youre right to quit
i learned about quitting
you know what mr g
i was practicing this one thing yesterday
and maybe you can listen to it
and tell me to quit after okay
okay
wow you really love this
yeah
so maybe id better stick with it
yeah
bye mr g
see you next week
so connie came here to quit
but then she didnt
22 forget about that listen
i need to know this joe
why didnt she quit
because she loves to play
she might say she hates everything
but trombone is her thing
shes good at it
maybe trombone is her spark i dont know
please if im gonna get this gig back
i need your help
okay
really
ill help you
but i wanna try a few things
cause i dont know
some of its not as boring
as it is at the you seminar
and if connie can find
something she loves here
maybe i can too
great
so what do we do first
this water hurts
its okay
you just have to turn the other knob
okay thats better

yo ian man how you get
that big peanut head
what happened to you

you know im sensitive about that
dez is the guy in the back
he can fix this
talk about havin a spark
this guy was born to be a barber
but i cant pass for you
in front of all your friends
dez is the only one that i talk to
we usually talk about jazz
but this time just sit there
get the cut and get out
hey joe what are you
doing here on a weekday
you didnt call for an appointment man
its gonna be a while
i was afraid of this
go ahead and sit down
my lord

this is an emergency
what that aint cool dez
you could always let harold cut your hair
his chairs wide open
nah i can wait
joe get your butt in this chair now
should i even ask you how this happened
the cat did it
stop sounding insane
i mean um i was distracted
getting ready to play with
dorothea williams tonight
dorothea williams
thats big time joe
congratulations
joe aint getting no gig dez
you know he mr closebutnocigar
this guy
joe ignore him
now lets fix you up
you keeping that cat on your lap
is it okay that i do that
suit yourself youre the boss
i am
when youre in this chair
yeah you are
so can i have one of those
sure joe
cool
i like being in the chair
hey get your head in the game
little chainsaw
you need to settle down
if you keep this
look i can deal with some freaky stuff
but if this cat dont chill
were gonna have to put it outside
well whats it gonna be kitty
meow
sometimes change is good
you have been rocking
that same style for a while
well dez for hundreds of years
ive had no style at all
you can say that again
but then my life changed
yeah what happened
i was existing as a theoretical construct
in a hypothetical way station
between life and death
i heard that
and by the time
i got to mentor number 266
i was seriously asking like
what is all the fuss about
like is all this living
really worth dying for
you know what i mean
i never knew you had
such an interesting education joe
i just thought you went to music school
and another thing
they say youre born to do something
but how do you figure out
what that thing is
i mean what if you pick up
the wrong thing
or somebody elses thing you know
then youre stuck
been there before
ill take one of those
i wouldnt call myself stuck
but i never planned on
cuttin heads for a livin
wait but you were born to be a barber
werent you
i wanted to be a veterinarian
so why didnt you do that
i was plannin to
when i got out of the navy
then my daughter got sick
and barber school
is a lot cheaper
than veterinarian school
well thats too bad
youre stuck as a barber
and now youre unhappy
whoa whoa slow your roll there joe
im happy as a clam my man
not everyone can be charles drew
inventing blood transfusions
or me playing piano
with dorothea williams
i know
you are not all that
anyone could play in a band
if they wanted to
dont pay paul any mind
people like him just bring
other people down
so they can make themselves feel better
i get it
hes just criticizing me to cover up
the pain of his own failed dreams
you cut deep joe
i wonder why sitting in this chair
makes me want to tell you things dez
thats the magic of the chair
thats why i love this job
i get to meet interesting folks like you
make them happy and make them handsome
wow am i crazy or do i look younger
i may not have invented
blood transfusions
but i am most definitely savin lives
i dont know about
this crazy cat guy thing man
but it is nice to finally talk to you
about something other than jazz joe
how come we um never
talked about your life before
you never asked
but im glad you did this time

you did up here
look my mom has her own
definition of what success is
and being a professional musician
isnt it
so let me see i need the suit fixed
for a school band recital
im not looking forward to this
but theres no reason she needs to know
i dont know
all the times ive been
so close to getting to my dreams
something always gets in the way

hes good
and ive heard music before
but ive never felt like this inside
of course you love music now
because youre me lets go

some kind of peace offering

just ask her nicely
if she can fix my suit
so mom is there any way

i know embarrassing right
so youll fix it
no
what
how long are you going
to keep doing this joey
you tell me youre going
to accept the fulltime position
here it comes
and instead
i hear youve taken another gig
tell her that this one is different
this ones different
does this gig have a pension
health insurance
no then its the same as the other ones
its like you cant even
be truthful with me anymore
fine well get the suit
off the rack somewhere
my mom has never understood

fine well get the suit
off the rack somewhere
my mom has never understood
what im trying to do with my life
what did you just say
oof can i run away now
like you usually do
no not this time
repeat after me
mom i know weve had some rough times
but youre right
i cant be truthful with you
because it seems like
no matter what i do you disapprove
look i know you love playing
then how come except for church
youre the happiest when i dont
i finally land the gig of my life
and youre upset
you didnt see how tough
being a musician was on your father
i dont want to see
you struggle like that
so dad could pursue his dreams
and i cant
your father had me
most times
this shop is what paid the bills
so when im gone whos gonna pay yours
music is all i think about
from the moment i wake up in the morning
to the moment i fall asleep at night
you cant eat dreams for breakfast joey
then i dont want to eat
this isnt about my career mom
its my reason for living
and i know dad felt the same way
im just afraid
that if i died today
that my life wouldve amounted to nothing
joey
lets make this work instead
thats my dads suit
lulu melba
bring your good scissors in here
we got work to do
wow this feels really nice
you look marvelous

you heard me right
the suit is wool not polyester

this cant be happenin
now im not gonna believe this
the half note
he made you pay for dinner
yeah
so you ready
to go home
i bet youre ready to get off
of this stinky rock
what do you think of earth anyway
i always said it was dumb but
i mean
just look at what i found
your mom sewed your suit
from this cute spool
when i was nervous dez gave me this
a guy on the subway yelled at me
it was scary
but i kind of liked that too
truth is ive always worried
that maybe theres something
wrong with me you know
maybe im not good enough for living
but then you showed me
about purpose and passion
and maybe skywatching can be my spark
or walking
im really good at walking
those really arent purposes 22
thats just regular old living
but hey when you get back
to the you seminar
you can give it an honest try
no but ive been at the you seminar
for thousands of years
and i have never felt this close
joe whos ready to go home
moonwind
the stars are almost in alignment
all right
ill have you back
in your bodies in no time
no ive gotta find it here on earth
this is my only chance to find my spark
22 youre only loving this stuff
because youre in my body
you can find your own thing to love
when you get back to the you seminar
now come on
i need my body back now
no
im in the chair
22
leave me alone
im trying to find my purpose
22 you come back here
mr mittens

you come back here right now
you stole my body
its your time to go joe gardner
no you dont
gotcha
no no no
no no
i was gonna play with dorothea williams
and i was about to find my spark
find your spark
my life was finally going to change
you promised but you wouldnt
even give me five minutes
i lost everything because of you
joe
you cheated
found him
joe gardner
youre back
terry you found them
no need to thank me
its so nice to have
everything back in order and
22 got her pass
my goodness
22 you got an earth pass
this is amazing
i knew you could do it
this is cray cray
but what
what filled in the last box
ill tell you what filled it in i did
it was my spark that changed that badge
she only got that because
she was living my life in my body
i was
come on mr gardner
joe its time for you
to accompany 22 to the earth portal
give you a chance to say goodbye
of course
its standard procedure
just hold on a minute
i get to set the count right
terry you have done a super job
well take it from here
youre amazing
well thank you
terrytime
go ahead you two
you dont know
you cant be sure why my pass changed
come on 22
think about it
you hated music until you were in my body
you hated everything until you were me
i hope you enjoy it
i have to ask
how the dickens did you do it
get that earth pass to change
you know what i
i just let her walk
a mile in my shoes you could say
well it worked
yeah
well you should probably
get going to the great beyond
hey um we never found out
what 22s purpose was
excuse me
you know her spark
her purpose was it music
biology walking
we dont assign purposes
where did you get that idea
because i have piano
its what i was born to do
thats my spark
a spark isnt a souls purpose
you mentors and your passions
your purposes your meanings of life
so basic
no no it
wow
it is music
my spark is music i
i know it is
im no good
i got no purpose
no purpose
no purpose
mr g
curley i made it
im ready to go

this is my band
i decide who plays
and if you dont go with me
youll be making the biggest
mistake of your career
yeah whys that
my only purpose on this planet is to play
its what i was meant to do
and nothings gonna stop me
well arent you an arrogant one

this says the young fish
this is water
what i want is the ocean

thats just regular old living
joe
joe
good heavens man
what are you doing in the zone
moonwind i messed up
i need to find 22
im afraid shes become a lost soul
what
ill explain on the way
when neither of you returned
to the half note
i suspected something had gone wrong
i came back here
and thats when i spotted her
lost souls are obsessed by something
that disconnects them from life
and now that 22 has technically lived
shes become one of them

im on it
shes got us
moonwind
a captain always
goes down with the ship

very special award i requested
but that i absolutely deserve
joe gardner

im not good enough nope no
nothing i just need to
fill out that last box
youre dishonest
all you make are bad decisions
you are unwise and you wont
make it in the world
youre so selfish
no one would ever want to be around you
loser
the world needs remarkable people
and you are the least
remarkable soul ive ever met
youll never find your spark
imbecile
i cannot help you
i just need to fill out that last box
im not good enough at all
you will never find your spark
theres no point
those arent purposes
you idiot
thats just regular old living
this is a waste of time
you only got that badge
because you were in my body
thats why you ruin everything
because you have no purpose
no no no
theres no point
youll never find your spark
because you have no purpose
im not good nope
nothing i just need to fill
out that last box i give up
you ready
to come live
im scared joe
im not good enough
anyway i never got my spark
yes you did
your spark isnt your purpose
that last box fills in
when youre ready to come live
and the thing is
youre pretty great at jazzing

its okay i already did
now its your turn
ill go with you
you know you cant do that

hey take a look

i think im speaking for all the jerrys
when i say thank you
for what
were in the business of inspiration joe
but its not often
we find ourselves inspired
really
so we all decided to give you
another chance
hopefully you will watch
where you walk from now on
but what about terry
