the count s off 
okay  first stop
is the excitable pavilion 
you four  in you go 
you five  you ll be aloof 
and you two  why not 
wait a minute 
this is where personalities come from 
of course  do you think people
are just born with them 
so  how do they get to earth  then 
well  they use the earth portal 
once they get a complete personality 
of course 
hello  hello 
goodbye 
whee 
whoo hoo 
wait  wait  wait

all righty  mentors

 hello  jerry   
   and join us inside 
   got a lost mentor for you 
thanks  jerry 
look  i m not sure
i m supposed to be here 
i understand 
mentoring isn t for everyone 
you re more than welcome to opt out 
actually  on second thought 
you know  the mentoring sounds like fun 
i m glad to hear it 
jerry will take it from here 
thanks  jerry 
head right on over there to jerry 
thank you  jerry 
is everyone here named jerry 
good luck 
jerry  we ve got a problem 
hello  there  terry 
the count s off 
i seriously doubt that 
the count hasn t been off in centuries 
151 000 souls go into
the great beyond every day 
that s 105 2 souls per minute  jerry 
1 75 souls per second 
and i count every single one of  em 
yep  i m aware 
it s my job to keep track
of this stuff  jerry 
i m the accountant 
and we all think
you re doing a wonderful job 
 don t we  everyone 
 absolutely 
looks good from where this guy s standing 
i d say no 
i m always counting 
i m counting right now 
you blinked five times
since i started talking  six 
right  since accounting is your job 
why don t you figure out the problem 
 maybe i will 
 wonderful 
hello again  terry 
don t play dumb with me 
okay  here we go 
 a  
hello  there  mentors 
i m jerry  a counselor here
at the you seminar 
now you don t remember it 
but you ve been here before 
but don t worry 
forgetting the trauma of childbirth
is one of the great gifts of the universe 
here at the you seminar 
all new souls are given unique
and individual personalities 
i m an agreeable skeptic
who s cautious yet flamboyant 
i m an irritable wallflower
who s dangerously curious 
i m a manipulative megalomaniac
who s intensely opportunistic 
ho  this one might be a handful 
but that s earth s problem 
you ll notice these souls
are all missing something 
what goes in this spot 
well  these souls need their  spark  
and that s where you come in 
maybe you will find their spark
in the hall of everything 
where literally anything
on earth could inspire 
or perhaps you ll prefer the hall of you 
featuring a selection of moments
from your own inspiring life 
and just what is this spark 
i know you re all excited to get to work 
so good luck finding the spark 
find the spark 
wow  that was informative

part of the program

marie antoinette

and then  like  once a week 
they make me come
to one of these you seminars 
it s not great  but i know what to expect

dad  i don t wanna go 
i don t like jazz 
black improvisational music 
it s one of our great contributions
to american culture 
at least give it a chance  joey 
this is where it all started 
this is the moment where
i fell in love with jazz 
listen to that 
see  the tune is just an excuse
to bring out the you 
and that s why i became a jazz musician 
it s not what we re looking for 
wait a minute  that s not how
i remember it going down 
come back when you have something 
 sorry  joe 
 sorry  joe 
we re looking
for something different 
two  three  four 
my life was meaningless 
no  no  no 
no  i will not accept this 
kid  give me that badge 
i m goin  back to my body 
yeah  sure  here 
unless it becomes an earth pass 
i m stuck with it 
well  what if i help you
turn it into an earth pass 
will you give it to me then 
wait   
i ve never thought of that 
i d get to skip life 
so  yes 
but we gotta get
this thing to change first 
and i ve never been able
to get it to change 
come on 
i know all about sparks 
because mine is piano 
really  nothin  at all 
no  not jazz  just music 
i don t like music sounds 
it feels like a little too much 
well  i m not going out like this 
where s that  hall of everything 
i ll be right back 
don t get ahead of yourself  pal 
by the way  why do you sound
like a middle aged white lady 
i don t 
this is all an illusion 
this whole place is a hypothetical 
i could sound
like this if i wanted to 
or sound like this instead 
i could even sound like you 
life is so unfair 
i don t wanna die 
somebody call the wambulance  wah 
i just use this voice
because it annoys people 
it s very effective 
don t worry  they re fine 
you can t crush a soul here 
that s what life on earth is for 
very witty 
okay  here we are 
this is the hall of everything 
whoa

 no smell  no taste 
 or touch  see

i kinda wanna let it spread 
nope 
hands are hard 
how about a librarian 
they re cool

who wouldn t like working
at a thankless job

losing due to budget cuts 
though i do like the idea
of randomly shushing people 
 look  obviously this   
 shh 
yeah  that s good 
meh 
meh 
meh 
meh 
well  i think that s everything 
  sorry 
  you told me you d try

if there s one thing i m not  it s a liar 
unlike abraham lincoln 
you re really okay being on a penny 
well  of course  it s an honor 
okay  but they put
andrew jackson on the 20 
jackson 
what can i say  joe 
earth is boring 
well  what else can we do  then 
because we re running out of time 
yeah  you know 
time s not really a thing here 
time s up 
nice try  bjorn  but no need to feel bad 
22 here can be a bit of a challenge 
even though i can t feel it

the physical and spiritual

we mystics meet in this glorious landscape
every tuesday 
so many of them  sad 
you know 
lost souls are not that different
from those in the zone

one becomes disconnected from life 
gotta find it 
gotta find it  gotta find it 
for a time  i was a lost soul myself 
 really 
 tetris 
there you are

close your eyes 
breathe into your crown chakra 
do we really need all this 
yes 
do you have a piano on board 
i could focus with that 
no pianos  joe  you must focus 
imagine silence 
shh 
now  concentrate on where your body is 
listen for cues

maybe 
i m telling you  joe

who cares  and you 
we only have room for
one weirdo here  so  scram 
get back to work 
no one understands my art 
moonwind  listen 
i gotta get out of here and back in there 
well  we ll have to perform
an old fashioned astral
transmigration displacement 
 a what 
 it s simply a way
to get your souls back where they belong 
and it s a glorious ritual  indeed 
full of chanting  dancing 
and best of all  bongos 
i need to be at the half note by 7 00 
so this needs to happen right now 
whoa  whoa  whoa  not so fast 
you must wait for another thin spot
to open between earth
and the astral plane 
and that won t occur
until orcus moves
into the house of gemini 
when is that 
well  the government calls it 6 30 
look  i ll meet you at the half note 
6 30  you serious 
i ll gather all
the necessary provisions   
i said  get out of here  go 
see you
at the half note at 6 30 
i ll take care of everything 
and stay away 
sure are a lot of garcias in here 
you re out there somewhere  little soul 
and i m gonna find ya 
all right  this is the last snack 
i can barely fit into my pants as it is 
6 30 is cutting it close  too close 
we gotta get back to my place
and get you cleaned up and   
we gotta hail a cab 
hold your hand out 
hold it up and out 
man  this would be hard
even if i wasn t wearing a hospital gown 
go  go  go 
just run to that one 
is that teach 
pepperoni 
aah  dorothea williams saw me 
what am i gonna do 
she s gonna think i m crazy 
maybe you should call her up
and tell her that we re not crazy 
i ve only been a person for an hour 
and even i know that s a bad idea 
i just gotta get back in my body
and really bring it tonight 
how come this part is stinky
but this part smells fine 
never mind 
just put those pants on 
sheesh  i can t believe i ve been
walking around in this city
with no pants on 
i don t even wanna be here  remember 
i don t want you here either  i just   
i just wanna get back to my body 
then get back to the club 
what s the matter with you 
i don t know 
it s the sun  it s just so   
my phone 
um    okay  your clothes
are rumbling again 
curley  no  no 
oops 
hey  mr  g  it s curley 
um   
i hope you re doin  okay 
dorothea freaked out when she saw you 
and she called this other guy  robert 
he s got the gig now  i m sorry 
no  no  no 
look  honestly 
your class was the only reason
i went to school at all 
like  i owe you a lot 
so  here s the plan 
clean yourself up  put on a killer suit 
and get to the club early 
i m gonna try and talk to her 
just make sure you show up
looking like a million bucks  all right 
i hope i see you  man 
all right  peace 
i can get the gig back  22 
i need your help  i have a suit 
i m gonna need you to try it on 
no  no  no 
and then i can line
my hair up a little bit 
  and i can   
  nope  no way  no how 
22 
mr  gardner 
it s connie 
she s here for her lesson 
  what do i do 
  i can hear you 
just tell her that you can t do it today 
hi  connie 
sorry  but joe can t do it today 
  you re joe 
  i mean  me 
me can t do it today 
good  now let s go
check out that suit 
i came to tell you that i quit 
quit 
we don t have time for this 
the suit is in the closet 
band is a stupid waste of time 
this kid is talking sense 
what are you doing 
here  i quit 
i think jazz is pointless 
yeah  jazz is definitely pointless 
hey 
in fact  all of school is a waste of time 
of course  like my mentor 
george orwell  used to say 
 state sponsored education
 is like the rattling of a stick
inside a swill bucket  
yeah 
the ruling class s core
curriculum stifles dissent 
it s the oldest trick in the book 
what are you talkin  about 
she doesn t care about any of that 
i ve been saying that
since the third grade 
you know  you seem really smart 
what is your position on pizza 
  i like it 
  me  too 
what are you doing 
i d rather hang with connie 
what  come back here 
you open this   
um  i think your cat wants to get out 
he thinks he knows everything 
22  don t you walk away from me 
come here right now 
i m gonna go in
and i mma scratch up the sofa 
wait a minute  that s my sofa 
you really got things figured out  connie 
i d better give this back 
it belongs to the school 
sure 
you know  i really am glad
there s someone else
who sees how ridiculous this place is 
you re right to quit 
i learned about quitting   
you know what  mr  g 
i was practicing this one thing yesterday
and maybe you can listen to it
and tell me to quit after  okay 
okay 
wow  you really love this 
yeah 
so  maybe i d better stick with it 
yeah 
bye  mr  g 
see you next week 
22 
so  connie came here to quit 
but then she didn t 
22  forget about that  listen 
i need to know this  joe 
why didn t she quit 
because she loves to play 
she might say she hates everything 
but trombone is her thing 
she s good at it 
maybe trombone is her spark  i don t know 
please  if i m gonna get this gig back 
i need your help 
okay 
really 
i ll help you 
but i wanna try a few things 
 cause i don t know 
some of it s not as boring
as it is at the you seminar 
and if connie can find
something she loves here 
maybe i can  too 
 great 
 so  what do we do first 
  this water hurts 
  it s okay 
you just have to turn the other knob 
okay  that s better 
and i wouldn t be mad
if you put a little lotion
on me when you re done 
i washed your butt for you 
spicy  spicy 
you five will be insecure 
and you 12 will be self absorbed 
we really should stop sending
so many through that pavilion 
found him 
see that  everybody 
who figured out why the count s off 
that s right  terry did 
it s terrytime 
 wow  nice work 
 well  who is it 
right 
joe gardner is his name 
looks like he s back down on earth 
that s not good 
that    that s the mentor
we set up with 22 
all right  all right 
easy on the hysterics 
terry s got this under control 
i ll handle it 
how 
i ll go down there and get him 
set the count right  lickety split 
okay  whoa 
are you sure that s a good idea 
look  you all are the ones who beefed it 
i m trying to un beef it 
but you cannot be seen 
by anyone 
don t worry  i ll make sure
no one else sees me 
i ll move among the shadows  like a ninja 
please  just do it quickly and quietly 
and also quickly 
and quietly as well 
this won t be a disaster  that s for sure 
trusty old brown suit 
still a perfect fit 
it s a little tight in the back here part 
it ll loosen  sit down 
i m a cat 
i ll do it 
you couldn t call an elevator  remember 
no way  i just need to line me up 
now be still 
it s like a little tiny chainsaw 
 don t move 
 i m not moving  you re moving 
no 
don t worry  i m okay 
no  no  no  my hair 
my hair is not okay 
this is a disaster 
we gotta fix this  right now 
 okay  how 
 we gotta go see dez 
great  who s dez 
yo  ian  man  how you get
that big peanut head 
what happened to you 
man  shut up  man 
you know i m sensitive about that 
dez is the guy in the back 
he can fix this 
talk about havin  a spark 
this guy was born to be a barber 
but i can t pass for you
in front of all your friends 
dez is the only one that i talk to 
we usually talk about jazz 
but this time  just sit there 
get the cut  and get out 
hey  joe  what are you
doing here on a weekday 
you didn t call for an appointment  man 
it s gonna be a while 
i was afraid of this 
go ahead and sit down 
my lord 
you gotta wait  son 
this is an emergency 
what  that ain t cool  dez 
you could always let harold cut your hair 
his chair s wide open 
nah  i can wait 
joe  get your butt in this chair now 
should i even ask you how this happened 
 the cat did it 
 stop sounding insane 
i mean  um  i was distracted
getting ready to play with
dorothea williams tonight 
dorothea williams 
that s big time  joe 
congratulations 
joe ain t getting no gig  dez 
you know he mr  close but no cigar 
this guy 
joe  ignore him 
now let s fix you up 
you keeping that cat on your lap 
is it okay that i do that 
suit yourself  you re the boss 
 i am 
 when you re in this chair 
yeah  you are 
so can i have one of those 
sure  joe 
cool 
i like being in the chair 
hey  get your head in the game 
little chainsaw 
you need to settle down 
if you keep this   
look  i can deal with some freaky stuff 
but if this cat don t chill 
we re gonna have to put it outside 
well  what s it gonna be  kitty 
meow 
sometimes  change is good 
you have been rocking
that same style for a while 
well  dez  for hundreds of years 
i ve had no style at all 
you can say that again 
but then my life changed 
yeah  what happened 
i was existing as a theoretical construct
in a hypothetical way station
between life and death 
i heard that 
and by the time
i got to mentor number 266 
i was seriously asking  like 
what is all the fuss about 
like  is all this living
really worth dying for 
you know what i mean 
i never knew you had
such an interesting education  joe 
i just thought you went to music school 
and another thing 
they say you re born to do something 
but how do you figure out
what that thing is 
i mean  what if you pick up
the wrong thing 
or somebody else s thing  you know 
 then you re stuck 
 been there before 
i ll take one of those 
i wouldn t call myself stuck 
but i never planned on
cuttin  heads for a livin  
wait  but you were born to be a barber 
weren t you 
i wanted to be a veterinarian 
so  why didn t you do that 
i was plannin  to
when i got out of the navy 
then my daughter got sick 
and barber school
is a lot cheaper
than veterinarian school 
well  that s too bad 
you re stuck as a barber
and now you re unhappy 
whoa  whoa  slow your roll there  joe 
i m happy as a clam  my man 
not everyone can be charles drew
inventing blood transfusions 
or me  playing piano
with dorothea williams 
i know 
you are not all that 
anyone could play in a band
if they wanted to 
don t pay paul any mind 
people like him just bring
other people down
so they can make themselves feel better 
i get it 
he s just criticizing me to cover up
the pain of his own failed dreams 
you cut deep  joe 
i wonder why sitting in this chair
makes me want to tell you things  dez 
that s the magic of the chair 
that s why i love this job 
i get to meet interesting folks like you 
make them happy  and make them handsome 
wow  am i crazy or do i look younger 
i may not have invented
blood transfusions 
but i am most definitely savin  lives 
i don t know about
this crazy cat guy thing  man 
but it is nice to finally talk to you
about something other than jazz  joe 
how come we  um  never
talked about your life before 
you never asked 
but i m glad you did this time 
  looking good  brother 
  have a great show 
i grabbed
a couple of road lollies 
dr  charma  call 3 1 6 2 
julia child didn t succeed
till she was 49 
hey  paul  here  have a lollipop 
yeah  thanks 
thanks  man 
there you are 
no hard feelings  right  all right 
just friends 
just friends goofing on each other 
all right 
okay  goodbye  paul 
come to terry 
gotcha 
thought you could cheat the universe 
well  you thought wrong 
i m the accountant 
and i m here to bring you in   
whoa   
you re not joe gardner 
my mistake 
we ll just get you back into
your meat suit 
there you go 
no harm  no foul 
boy  look  fella 
i m thinking there s no reason
we can t keep this little
incident between us 
mistakes happen 
and  it s not your time 
unless you keep eating
those processed foods 
am i right 
but seriously  stay away
from those processed foods 
you know what 
you did all right back there 
how did you know how to deal with paul 
i didn t  i just let out the me 
hey  like you said about jazz 
i was jazzing 
first of all 
 jazzing  is not a word 
and second  music and life
operate by very different rules 
it says take one 
don t    or do  okay  fine 
 man with a van  
i got a few in case we need a lot of vans 
now  let s get back to the plan 
we go to the half note
and wait there for moonwind 
it s around 4 00 p m  now   
you know what 
you are really getting good
at using those legs 
why don t you try runnin  
hey  i made a song 
i m jazzing 
okay  enough of the jazzing
and everything like that 
we need to get somewhere 
now  i   
  that tickles 
  what are you doing 
whoops  i got it 
would you hurry up 
okay 
you were right 
these pants are loosening 
no  no  no 
don t let people see your butt 
  it s your butt 
  it doesn t matter whose butt   
take off the jacket 
tie it around your waist 
quick  cover the butt 
what are we gonna do 
i can t find a tailor this late   
no  we re gonna have to go to mom s 
okay 
no  no  no  you don t understand 
mom doesn t know about this gig 
and she s not gonna like it 
okay 
we don t have any other choice 
okay 
she s the only one that can fix this 
 okay 
 stop saying  okay  
we gotta catch the subway across town 
come on 
okay    got it 
my mom doesn t know
anything about the gig 
and i wanna keep it that way  okay 
right  because she thinks
you re a failure 
 what 
 i didn t say that 
you did  up here 
look  my mom has her own
definition of what success is 
and being a professional musician
isn t it 
so  let me see  i need the suit fixed
for a  school band recital 
i m not looking forward to this 
but there s no reason she needs to know   
i don t know 
all the times i ve been
so close to getting to my dreams 
something always gets in the way 
you know what i mean 
he s good 
and i ve heard music before 
but i ve never felt like this inside 
of course  you love music now 
because you re me  let s go 
let s go 
whoa 
hey  take it easy 
i m sorry 
don t worry about it 
it s the subway 
it does that to some people 
 does what 
 it wears you down 
it stinks  it s hot  it s crowded 
every day the same thing 
day in and day out 
but once i get on the stage tonight 
all my troubles are going to be fixed 
you re gonna see a brand new joe gardner 
where d you get that 
under the seat 
can you believe it 
it s still half full 
all right  remember 
i need the suit fixed for a band recital 
got it 
  joey  baby boy   
  joey 
  i m so proud of you 
     we heard the news 
crap  she knows 
your momma s in the back 
 you gotta go in there 
 no  i don t want to 
you have to 
we need the suit fixed 
you forgetting something  joey 
 what 
 kiss her 
i always kiss melba when i see her 
just do it 
no  no  no  not on the lips 
joey 
what has gotten into you  boy 
let him finish 
cougar  i knew it 
i ll take another kiss
when you get back  joey 
so much for being done
chasing after gigs 
i hope that cat isn t supposed to be
some kind of peace offering 
come  come on 
just say you rescued it 
um  no  it s mine  i rescued it 
too bad you can t rescue your career 
just ask her nicely
if she can fix my suit 
so  mom  is there any way
you can fix this 
whoa  i don t need to see that 
i know  embarrassing  right 
so  you ll fix it 
  no 
  what 
how long are you going
to keep doing this  joey 
you tell me you re going
to accept the full time position   
here it comes 
   and instead 
i hear you ve taken another gig 
tell her that this one is different 
this one s different 
does this gig have a pension 
health insurance 
no  then it s the same as the other ones 
it s like you can t even
be truthful with me anymore 
fine  we ll get the suit
off the rack somewhere 
my mom has never understood
what i m trying to do with my life 
fine  we ll get the suit
off the rack somewhere 
my mom has never understood
what i m trying to do with my life 
 22 
 what did you just say 
oof  can i run away now 
like you usually do 
no  not this time 
repeat after me 
mom  i know we ve had some rough times 
but you re right 
i can t be truthful with you 
because it seems like
no matter what i do  you disapprove 
look  i know you love playing 
then how come except for church 
you re the happiest when i don t 
i finally land the gig of my life
and you re upset 
you didn t see how tough
being a musician was on your father 
i don t want to see
you struggle like that 
so dad could pursue his dreams 
and i can t 
your father had me 
most times 
this shop is what paid the bills 
so when i m gone  who s gonna pay yours 
music is all i think about 
from the moment i wake up in the morning
to the moment i fall asleep at night 
you can t eat dreams for breakfast  joey 
then i don t want to eat 
this isn t about my career  mom 
it s my reason for living 
and i know dad felt the same way 
i m just afraid
that if i died today 
that my life would ve amounted to nothing 
joey 
let s make this work instead 
that s my dad s suit 
lulu  melba 
bring your good scissors in here 
we got work to do 
wow  this feels really nice 
 you look marvelous 
 it fits perfectly 
you see how i did that 
that is one fine wool suit 
if i do say so myself 
 can i try on that 
 of course you can 
just handsome 
thank you  mom 
ray would have been so proud of you  baby 
like i ve always been 
you heard me  right 
the suit is wool  not polyester 
so  don t go putting that cat
on your shoulders again 
yes  ma am 
there s a nice little taper there 
thanks  mom 
that was amazin  
you know what that felt like 
it felt like jazz 
yeah  you were jazzing 
ha ha  okay  jazzing 
i m telling you  joe 
you really should call lisa again 
i don t really have time
for a relationship right now  22 
busy right now 
wanna wait till you die a second time 
cool  cool  cool 
i can t believe
i m getting romantic advice
from an unborn soul 
i can think of worse 
there it is 
we made it 
this is going to work 
whoa  i can t believe how good i look 
the suit  the cut 
just look at me 
  ooh  just turn a little bit right there 
  like this 
  angle the shoulders  and   
  hey  who s that 
  and from this side 
  that s it 
what  who s back here 
  still me  
  that s a winner 
right 
this can t be happenin  
now  i m not gonna believe this 
the half note 
he made you pay for dinner 
yeah   
so  you ready 
to go home 
i bet you re ready to get off
of this stinky rock 
what do you think of earth  anyway 
i always said it was dumb  but   
i mean   
just look at what i found 
your mom sewed your suit
from this cute spool 
when i was nervous  dez gave me this 
a guy on the subway yelled at me 
it was scary 
but i kind of liked that  too 
truth is  i ve always worried
that maybe there s something
wrong with me  you know 
maybe i m not good enough for living 
but then you showed me
about purpose and passion 
and maybe sky watching can be my spark 
or walking 
i m really good at walking 
those really aren t purposes  22 
that s just regular old living 
but  hey  when you get back
to the you seminar 
you can give it an honest try 
no  but i ve been at the you seminar
for thousands of years
and i have never felt this close 
joe  who s ready to go home 
moonwind 
the stars are almost in alignment 
all right 
i ll have you back
in your bodies in no time 
no  i ve gotta find it here  on earth 
this is my only chance to find my spark 
22  you re only loving this stuff
because you re in my body 
you can find your own thing to love
when you get back to the you seminar 
now  come on 
i need my body back  now 
no 
i m in the chair 
  22 
  leave me alone 
i m trying to find my purpose 
22  you come back here 
22 
mr  mittens 
there they are 
you come back here right now 
you stole my body 
it s your time to go  joe gardner 
no  you don t 
gotcha 
no  no  no 
no  no 
i was gonna play with dorothea williams 
and i was about to find my spark 
find your spark 
my life was finally going to change 
you promised  but you wouldn t
even give me five minutes 
i lost everything because of you 
joe 
you cheated 
found him 
 joe gardner 
 you re back 
terry  you found them 
no need to thank me 
it s so nice to have
everything back in order  and   
22 got her pass 
  my goodness 
  22  you got an earth pass 
this is amazing 
i knew you could do it 
this is cray cray 
but what   
what filled in the last box 
i ll tell you what filled it in  i did 
it was my spark that changed that badge 
she only got that because
she was living my life in my body 
  i was   
  come on  mr  gardner 
joe  it s time for you
to accompany 22 to the earth portal 
give you a chance to say goodbye 
of course 
it s standard procedure 
just hold on a minute 
i get to set the count right 
terry  you have done a super job 
we ll take it from here 
you re amazing 
well  thank you 
terrytime 
go ahead  you two 
you don t know 
you can t be sure why my pass changed 
come on  22 
think about it 
you hated music until you were in my body 
you hated everything until you were me 
i hope you enjoy it 
i have to ask 
how the dickens did you do it 
get that earth pass to change 
you know what  i   
i just let her walk
a mile in my shoes  you could say 
well  it worked 
yeah 
well  you should probably
get going to the great beyond 
hey  um  we never found out
what 22 s purpose was 
  excuse me 
  you know  her  spark 
her purpose  was it music 
biology  walking 
we don t assign purposes 
where did you get that idea 
because i have piano 
it s what i was born to do 
that s my spark 
a spark isn t a soul s purpose 
you mentors and your passions 
your purposes  your meanings of life 
so basic 
no  no  it   
wow 
it is music 
my spark is music  i   
i know it is 
i m no good 
i got no purpose 
no purpose 
no purpose 
mr  g 
curley  i made it 
i m ready to go 
you re too late  man 
let me talk to dorothea 
no  no  no  man 
she don t play that 
these rappers act like   
who let this lunatic in here 
listen  you gotta give me another chance 
this is my band 
i decide who plays 
and if you don t go with me 
you ll be making the biggest
mistake of your career 
yeah  why s that 
my only purpose on this planet is to play 
it s what i was meant to do 
and nothing s gonna stop me 
well  aren t you an arrogant one 
i guess you really are a jazz player 
tell robert he s out  for now

he swims up to this older fish and says 
 i m trying to find this thing

remarkable soul i ve ever met 
you ll never find your spark 
imbecile

i m not good enough at all

this is a waste of time 
you only got that badge
because you were in my body 
that s why you ruin everything 
because you have no purpose

there s no point 
you ll never find your spark 
because you have no purpose

i think i m speaking for all the jerrys
when i say thank you 
for what 
we re in the business of inspiration  joe 
but it s not often
we find ourselves inspired 
really 
so  we all decided to give you
another chance 
hopefully  you will watch
where you walk from now on 
but what about terry 
we worked it out with terry 
that s weird 
hey  terry  what s that over there
