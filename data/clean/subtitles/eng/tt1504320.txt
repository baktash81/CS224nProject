from his majesty    t  ek
   the king 
sir blandine bentham 
inhale deep into your lungs  
your royal highness 
relaxes your larynx  does it not 
cigarette smoking calms the nerves
and gives you confidence 
if your highness will be very kind as
to open your hand   
it s sterilized  now  
now   if i may take the liberty 
   insert some into your mouth 
excuse me  doctor 
what is the purpose of this 
the classic approach 
it cured demosthenes 
that was in ancient greece   uh
has it worked since 
now 
if you would be so kind as to read   
a wealth of words 
fight against those marbles 
your royal highness 
enunciate 
a little more concentration
your royal higness 
i nearly swallowed
the bloody things 
thank you so much  doctor

  shakespeare  how are you 
how do you do 
coughing a lot 
now  this is slightly awkward  but  
i m afraid you re late 
yes 
i m afraid i am 
where s mr johnson 
he doesn t know i m here 
that s not a promising start 
my husband has seen everyone to no avail 
awefully  fraid he s given up hope 
he hasn t seen me 
you re awfully sure of yourself 
well 
i m sure of anyone who wants to be cured 
of course  he wishes to be cured 
my husband is umm  
he s required to speak publicly 
perhaps he should change jobs 
  he can t 
indentured servitude 
something of that nature 
well we need to  have your hubby pop by   
uh  tuesday would be good   
he can give me his personal details and
i ll make a frank appraisal and then  we can take it from there 
doctor  forgive me 
i do not have a  hubby  
we don t  pop  
and nor do we ever talk about our private lives 
you   
must come to us 
i m sorry  mrs johnson 
my game  my turf  my rules 
you ll have to talk over this with your hauband
and then you can speak to me on the telephone 
thank you very much for dropping by   
good afternoon 
and what if my husband were the duke of york 
the duke of york 
yes   
the duke of york 
i thought the appointment was for  johnson  
forgive me  your     
    royal highness 
johnson was used during the great war 
when the navy didn t want the enemy
to know  he  was aboard 
  am i   considered the enemy 
you will be 
if you remain un  obliging 
of course 
how did you find me  your royal highness 
the president of the speech therapists society 
eileen mccleod 
she s a sport 
dr mccleod warned me your antipodean methods
were  unorthodox and controversial  
i warned her   
those were not my favorite words 
i can cure your husband 
but for my  method to work i need trust and total equality 
here  in the safety of my consultation room 
no exceptions 
well then  in that case   
when can you start 
still sounds a bit rough  mate 
you make me drive too slowly  dad 
did you pick mum up from bridge 
yes  i ve hardly been out of the car all day 
i had a special visitor this afternoon 
  may i please leave this table
  how special  special 
no  you must stay 
bored stupid  listening to your
parents  inane conversation 
  thanks dad  
  and mum 
  me too 
  you meeting jean 
  no  someone else 
doctor  doctor  can t you help
your brother with the washing   
i m fine 
who s it lionel 
why bring it up
if you can t talk about it 
myrtle  it s just a woman 
looking to help her husband 
oh 
and i had a  call  
for an audition 
one of my favorites 
  aren t they all 
it could be a lot of fun 
i m sure you ll be splendid 
they re a highly regarded group 
from putney 
tomorrow  chapter iv 
 the flight  
oh  to fly away 
weren t they lucky 
now papa tell a  story 
  could i be a penguin instead 
once  there were two princesses   
princess elizabeth and princess margaret 
whose papa was a penguin 
this was because he  had been
turned into one by the wicket witch 
this was an   
inconvenient for him  
because he loved to hold
his princesses in his arms   
and you can t because he
don t have wings like herrings
  herrings don t have wings 
  penguins have wings
which is shaped like herrings
and make matters worse   
is that she
sent him to the south pole 
which is an awfully long walk  back 
if you can t fly 
so  when he reached the water 
he dived in through the dept so fast   
that he was in southampton
waters by lunchtime 
and from there 
he took the 2 30 to weybridge 
changed at clapham junction and asked
a passing mallard the way to buckingham palace 
he swam up the thames 
out through the  plughole 
and gave the cook 
mama and    mrs whittaker quite a shock 
now when the girls heard all the commotions 
they ran to the kitchen where
they gave him a good scrub 
a mackerel and a kiss 
and as they kissed him 
guess what he turned into 
  a handsome prince 
a short tailed albatross 
with wings so big
that he could wrap them both
his two girls together 
now  now  
it s time for bed 
will mrs simpson  be there 
  my brother s insisting 
  is he serious 
  about her coming to dinner 
  no  about her 
  a married woman  he can t be 
  she can 
by the way 
i think i found someone rather interesting 
on harley street  a doctor 
  out of the question 
i m not having this conversation again 
the matter s settled 
  his approach seems rather different    
now 
now 
 now is the winter of our discontent 
made glorious summer
by this sun of york  
 and all the clouds
that lour d upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried 
now are our brows 
bound with victorious    wreaths 
  thank you 
lovely diction mr    
  logue  lionel logue 
  well  mr logue 
i m not hearing the cries of a deformed
creature yearning to be king 
nor did i realize richard the third
was king of the colonies 
i do know the lines 
i ve played the role before 
  sydney 
  perth 
  major theater town  is it 
 enthusiastic 
  ah 
  i was well reviewed 
yes   
well   lionel 
i think our dramatic society 
is looking for someone slightly younger
and a   
little more regal 
where did you find this   physician 
classifieds 
next to  french model 
shepherd s market  
he comes highly recommended 
charges substantial fees
in order to help the poor 
oh dear 
perhaps he s a bolshevik  
no receptionist 
he likes to keep things simple 
  the johnsons 
you can go in now   mr  johnson  
lionel says   
wait here if you  wish  mrs johnson 
or  it being a p 
pleasant day 
p perhaps take a stroll 
was that alright   lionel 
marvellous  willy 
you can stay and wait for your mom 
mrs johnson   
mr johnson  do come in 
he s a good lad  willy 
he could hardly make a sound  you know 
when he first came to me 
my boys made those 
good  aren t they 
please make yourself comfortable 
i was told not to sit too close 
well i believe when speaking with a prince 
one waits for the prince to choose a topic 
waiting for me to   
commence
a conversation   
one can wait a rather long wait 
do you know any jokes 
timing isn t my strong suit 
cuppa tea 
no thank you 
aren t you going to start treating me
dr logue 
only if you re interested in being treated 
please 
call me lionel 
i prefer doctor 
i prefer lionel 
what ll i call you 
your royal highness 
then sir after that 
a bit formal for here 
what about your name 
prince albert    frederick arthur
george 
how about bertie 
only my family uses that 
perfect 
in here  it s better if we re equals 
if we were equal i wouldn t be
here 
i d be at home with my wife
and no one would give a damn 
please  don t do that 
i m sorry 
i believe  sucking smoke
into your lungs will kill you 
my physicians say
it relaxes the throat 
they re idiots 
they ve all been knighted 
makes it official then 
my  castle   my rules 
what was your earliest memory 
what 
an earth do you mean 
your first recollection 
i m not   
here to discuss my personal matters 
why re you here then 
because i bloody well stammer 
you have a bit of a temper 
one of my many faults 
when did the defect start 
i ve always been this way 
i doubt that 
don t tell me  it s my stammer 
  its my field 
i can assure you 
no infant starts to speak with a stammer 
when did yours start 
four or five 
that s typical 
so i ve been told 
i can t remember not doing it 
i can believe that  do you hesitate
when you think 
don t be ridiculous 
how about
when you talk to yourself 
everyone natters occasionally
bertie 
stop calling me that 
i m not going to call you anything
else 
then we shan t speak 
are you charging for this  doctor 
a fortune 
so  when you
talk to yourself  do you stammer 
of course not 
well  that proves your impediment isn t
a permanent part of you 
what do
you think was the cause 
i don t know 
i don t care 
i stammer 
and no one can fix it 
i bet you   you can read
flawlessly  right here  right now 
and if i win  i get to ask
questions 
  and if i win 
  you don t have to answer 
one usually    
wagers money 
a bob each to sweeten it 
lets see your shilling  
  i don t   
carry money 
  i had a funny feeling you mightn t 
i ll stake you 
you can  pay me back next time 
  who says there is a next time 
  i haven t agreed
to take you on  yet 
please stand 
and take a look at that   
i can t  read this 
then you owe me a shilling  
for not trying 
 to be   
or not to be     that   
i can t read 
i haven t finished yet 
i m going to record your voice and
then play it back to you on the same machine 
this is brilliant 
it s the latest thing from america 
its a silvertone 
pop this on 
there s a bob in this  mate  you
can go home rich 
  you re playing music 
  i know 
how can i hear what i m saying  
surely a prince s brain knows what
its mouth is doing 
you re not well acquainted with
royal princes  are you 
hopeless 
hopeless 
you were sublime  would i lie to a
prince of the realm to win twelve pence 
i ve no idea what an australian
might do for that sort of money 
let me play it back to you 
no 
all right then 
i get to ask you the question 
thank you doctor 
i don t feel  
this is for me 
thank you for your time 
bye 
  sir 
the recording is free 
please  
keep it as a souvenir 
king george v  o s  
for the present  the work to which
we are all equally bound 
is to arrive at a reasoned
tranquillity   
   within our borders  to regain
prosperity in this time of depression without self seeking
and to carry with us those whom the
burden of past years has disheartened or overborne 
to all 
to each 
i wish a happy christmas 
god bless you 
easy when you know how 
have a go yourself 
congratulations  sir 
ah  mr wood 
splendid fellow  chap taught me everything i know 
let the microphone do the work 
sit up 
straight back 
face boldly up to the bloody thing
and stare it square in the eye 
as you would any decent englishman 
show who s in command 
papa  i d d don t
thu thu think i c c can read this 
  this devilish device will change
everything if you don t 
in the past all a king had to do was look
respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse 
now we must invade people s homes
and ingratiate ourselves with them 
this family is reduced to those lowest 
basest of all creatures   
we ve become   actors 
  we re not a family 
we re a firm 
  yet at any moment 
some of us may be out of work 
your darling brother 
and future king 
the only wife he appears interested in
is invariably the wife of another 
  he s broken off
with lady furness 
and taken up a mrs simpson 
a woman
with two husbands living 
i told him straight 
no divorced person could ever be received at court 
he said 
 it made him sublimely happy  
i imagined that was because she was
sleeping with him 
 i give you my word   
this is what he said 
 i give you my
word we ve never had immoral relations  
stared square into his father s eyes   
and lied 
when i m dead that boy will ruin
himself  this family  and this nation  within twelve months 
who ll pick up the pieces 
herr hitler  intimidating half of
europe  marshall stalin the other half 
who ll stand between us  the
jackboots  and the proletarian abyss 
you 
with your older brother shirking his duties 
you re going to have to do a lot more of this 
have a go yourself 
son 
get it out boy 
   m marvels of m 
  modern   
just take your time  
form your words carefully
science  i am enabled  this    
  relax 
just try it 
do it 
lying   
bastard 
 to be  or not to be 
  that is the question   
    whether tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
or to take arms against a sea of
troubles  and by opposing end them   
   to die   
to sleep  no more   
strictly  business 
no p  
personal nonsense 
i thought i d made that very clear
in our interview 
  got the shilling you owe me 
  no i haven t 
  didn t think so 
besides 
you tricked me 
physical excercises and tricks are important   
what you re asking will only deal
with the surface of the problem 
that s sufficient 
as far as i see it 
my hausband   
has mechanical difficulties with his speech 
maybe   
just deal with that 
  i m willing to work hard  doctor logue   
  lionel 
  are you  
are you willing to do your part 
alright 
you want mechanics 
we need to relax your throat muscles
and strengthen your tongue 
by repeating tongue twisters for example 
 i am a thistle sifter  i have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles 
because i am a thistle sifter  
  fine 
you have a flabby tummy 
we must build up the strength in your diaphragm 
simple mechanics 
that is all we ask 
and that s about a shilling s worth 
forget about the blessed shilling 
perhaps  upon occasion 
you might be requested
some assistance in cope with a minor event 
will that agreeable 
of course 
that will be the full extent of your services 
  shall i see you next week 
  i shall see you every day 
ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah 
feel the loosening of the jaw
take a nice deep breath 
expand your chest  
how do you feel 
full of hot air 
  isn t that what public speaking is all about 
are you alright  bertie 
this is actually quite good fun 
  hello  bertie 
  hello david 
where ve you been 
been busy 
  so was i 
elizabeth has pneumonia 
i m sorry  she ll recover 
father won t 
  i ll drive 
old bugger s doing this on purpose 
dying 
departing prematurely   
to complicate matters 
oh for heaven s sake  david  you
know how long he s been ill 
wallis explained  she s terribly
clever about this thing 
lord wigram 
    whereas by letters patent underthe great seal  bearing date of
westminster  the eleventh june 1912
his majesty king george v did constitute 
order and declare that there should be a guardian 
custos regni 
in the form of councillors of state
it s the order of the council for
the state  sir 
so we may act on your behalf 
i m still confused   
approved 
thank you 
feeling a little better sir 
no  i m not feeling any better  i
feel dreadful 
have you been ice skating 
  ice skating 
no  george 
   i know  darling  a talk  even a
lovely long talk  is a poor substitute
for holding tight and making drowsy 
nor making our own drowsies either 
as we ve had to dofar too often lately 
david  dinner 
  i m on with wallis 
wallis misses me terribly 
  mama says you re late for dinner 
  she forgets papa s bloody clocks
were always half an hour fast 
how is the king 
i hope he is not in pain 
no  no  his majesty 
he s quieter now 
thank you 
david  if your father were well  tardiness
would not be tolerated 
none of this  
unpleasantness would be tolerated
you know sir  i appreciate that yo
are different from your father in your outlook and temperament 
i want you to know that whenever
the king questioned your conduct 
i  tried in your interest  to present
it in a most favourable light 
i can always trust you to have my
best interests at heart 
i fear  our vigil will not be of
long duration 
please  continue 
we commend our brother george to
the mercy of god  our maker and redeemer 
long live the king 
i hope 
i will make good as he has made good 
what on earth was that 
poor wallis 
now i m trapped 
time for a shake  dad 
you sure 
go on 
put your thinking caps on 
bet its the scottish play 
no  i bet it s othello 
it s always othello 
 art thou afeard  
caliban 
oh  for heaven s sake   that was a
lucky guess 
don t listen to egghead 
go on  dad 
 the isle is full ofnoises sounds and sweet airs 
that give delight  and hurt not 
sometimes a thousand twanging instruments
will hum about mine ears 
and sometimes voices that  if then i had waked after
long sleep will make me sleep again  
alright  clever clogs 
what comes next 
   and then  in dreaming 
the clouds me thought would open 
and show riches ready to drop upon me 
that when i m awake    
   when i waked  i cried to dream again  
it s such a sad thought 
my next patient must be early 
you better go lads  i m sorry 
won t be a moment  clifford 
bertie 
they told me not to expect you 
i am sorry about your father 
i don t wish to intrude  
oh no   
course  please come in 
i ve been practising  one hour a
day  in spite of everything 
what s going on there 
i was  sorry 
mucking around with my kids 
do you feel like working today 
a curtis bi plane 
i ll put on some hot milk 
logue  i d kill for something stronger 
i wasn t there for my father s
death  still makes me sad 
i can imagine so 
what did you father do 
he was a brewer 
at least there was free beer 
here s to the memory of your father 
i was informed 
after the fact   
that  my father s last words were 
 bertie has more guts than the rest of his
brothers put together  
he couldn t say that to my face 
my brother 
what about him 
try singing 
i m sorry 
know any songs 
songs 
yes songs 
 swanee river  
i love that song 
happens to be my favorite 
sing me the chorus 
no   certainly not 
always wanted to build models 
father wouldn t allow it 
he collected stamps 
we had to collect stamps 
you can finish that off 
if you sing 
i m not going to sit here 
wobbling 
you can with me 
because you re peculiar 
i take that as a compliment 
i m not crooning  swanee river  
try  camptown races  then 
 my brother d  he said to me  doo 
dah doo dah     continuous sound will give you flow 
does it feel strange 
now that david s on the throne 
to tell the truth 
it was a relief   
knowing i wouldn t be king 
but unless he produces an heir 
you re next in line 
and your daughter  elizabeth 
would then succeed you 
 you re barking up the wrong tree
now  doctor  doctor  
 lionel  see 
you didn stammer 
of course i didn t stammer  i was singing 
well  as a little reward  you get
to put some glue on these struts 
your boy 
won t mind 
no  not at all 
david and i were very close  young
bucks    you know 
chase the same girls 
david was always very helpful in arranging introductions 
we shared the expert ministrations of  paulette  in paris 
not at the same time of course 
did david tease you 
yes  they all did 
 buh buh buh bertie  
father encouraged it   get it out 
boy   said it would make me stop 
said    i was afraid of my father 
and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me  
are you naturally right handed 
left 
i was punished  now i use the right 
yes  that s very common with stammerers 
anything other corrections 
knock knees 
metal splints were made   worn
night and day 
that must have been painful 
bloody agony 
straight legs now 
who were you closest to in your family 
nannies  not my first nanny 
though  she loved david   hated me 
when we are presented to my parents
for the daily viewing  she d pinch me  
i d cry and
be handed back to her  
immediately 
then   
she would   
sing it 
  then she wouldn t feed me 
far far away  
took three years for my parents to notice 
as you can imagine  it
caused some stomach problems  still 
what about your brother johnnie 
were you close to him 
johnny  
sweet boy 
epilepsy   and   
he was  different  
died at 13  hidden from view 
i ve been told it s not catching 
do you want a top up 
please 
you know  lionel  you re the first
ordinary englishman   
australian 
   i ve ever really spoken to 
sometimes  when i ride through the
streets and see  you know 
the common man staring at me 
i m struck by how little i know of hislife 
and how little he knows of mine 
thank you 
what re friends for 
i wouldn t know 
 i sifted seven thick stalked
thistles through strong thicksieves  i sifted seven    
one hundred year old
oaks   removed to improve the view 
who does she think she is 
nonetheless   we must try to be
pleasant towards mrs simpson 
you know she calls me  the fat
scottish cook  
you re not fat 
i m getting plump 
you seldom cook 
i sifted seven 
shut up  
their royal highnesses the duke and
duchess of york 
how lovely to see you both 
welcome
to our little country shack 
i came at the invitation of the
king 
hello david 
you re making some changes to
the garden  i see
yes  i am 
i am not quite finished 
don t tell me i behaved badly  mr churchill 
on the contrary  your royal
highness  etiquette decrees royalty
must be greeted by the official host  in this case  the king 
not a commoner 
  thank you 
what is her hold on him 
i have no idea 
apparently she has
certain   skills 
   in an establishment in shanghai 
david 
i ve been trying to see you   
i ve been terribly busy 
doing what 
kinging 
kinging 
is a precarious business 
these days 
where is the russian tsar 
where is cousin wilhelm 
you re being dreary 
is kinging laying off eighty staff at sandringham
and buying yet more pearls for wallis while there ar
people marching across europe singing  the red flag  
stop your worrying  herr hitler
will sort that lot out 
who ll sort out herr hitler 
and you ve put that woman into our
mother s suite 
mother s not still in the bed 
is she 
that s not funny 
wally likes the very best 
i don t care what woman you carry
on with at night 
as long as you show up for duty in the morning 
wally is not just some woman i am
carrying on with 
we intend to marry 
excuse me 
she s filing a petition for
divorce 
good god 
can t you just give her a nice
house and a title 
i won t have her as my mistress 
david  the church does not
recognise divorce and you are the head of the church 
haven t i any rights 
many privileges   
not the same thing 
your beloved common man may marry for love 
why not me 
if you were the common man  on what
basis could you possibly claim to be king  
sounds like you ve studied our
wretched constitution 
sounds like you haven t 
is that what this is all about  brushing up  
hence the elocution lessons 
i m trying to t t   
yearning for a larger audience are we 
b b b bertie 
d don t    
younger brother trying to push older
brother off throne  
pa pa  
   positively medieval 
where have you been all this time 
  never you mind 
ahh  what a complicated
lovely coon you are 
  i try to be 
all that work  down the drain 
my own brother   
i couldn t say  
i couldn t say a word in reply 
why do you stammer more with david
than you do with me 
because you re bloody well paid to listen 
bertie 
i m not a geisha girl 
stop trying to be so bloody clever 
what is it about david that stops you speaking 
what is it about you  that bloody makes
want you to go on about it  all the time 
vulgar but fluent  you don t
stammer when you swear 
bugger off 
is that the best you can do 
well  bloody bugger to you 
you beastly bastard 
a public school prig can do better
than that 
shit  
shit  shit  shit 
shit 
see how defecation flows trippingly
from the tongue 
because i m angry 
you know the f word 
fornication 
oh bertie 
fuck  fuck  fuck  fuck 
yes  you see  not a hesitation 
bloody  bloody  bloody  shit  shit 
shit  bugger  bugger  bugger  fuck  fuck  fuck 
dad  what s going on 
sorry  finish your homework
well   that s a side of you we don t
get to see that often 
no  no we re not supposed to
really  not publicly 
let s get some air 
no logue  i don t think that s a
good idea 
what s the matter 
what s got you so upset 
logue  you have no idea 
my brother is infatuated with a woman who s
been married twice 
she s asking for a divorce and
david is determined to marry her 
mrs wallis simpson of baltimore 
that s not right 
queen wallis of baltimore 
unthinkable 
can he do that 
absolutely not 
but he s going to anyway 
all hell s broken loose 
  can t they carry on privately 
  if only they would 
  where does that leave you 
i know my place 
i ll do anything   
in my power to keep my brother on the throne 
 is it that serious 
your place may be on the throne 
i am not an alternative to my
brother 
if you had to you could outshine david   
don t take liberties 
that s bordering on treason 
i m just saying you could be king 
you could do it 
that is treason 
i m trying to get you to realise
you need not be governed by fear 
i ve had enough of this 
what re you afraid of 
your poisonous words 
why d you come to me 
you are not some middle class bugger 
who needs elocution lessons so you can chit chat   
don t instruct me on my duties 
i m the son of a     
king   
the brother of a king 
you re the disappointing son of a brewer 
a jumped up jackeroo from the
outback 
you re nobody 
these sessions are over 
it s not because she s an american 
that is the least of it 
it s because she is a soon to
be a twice divorced american 
and the king as  head of the church of england   
can not marry a divorced woman 
and sir 
i apologize for the nature of this 
according to scotland yard 
the king has not always possess exclusive  rights
to mrs  simpson s   
favours and affections 
sharing them with a
married used car salesman 
a certain mr guy trundle 
in addition  it is also rumoured   
hitler s ambassador  count von ribbentrop 
sends her 17 carnations every day 
should your brother continue to
ignore the advice of his government  he must abdicate 
otherwise his government has no
choice but to resign 
prime minister 
you d leave the
country without a government 
does the king do what he wants 
or does he do what his people expect him to do 
what s the matter  love 
i m just having trouble with a patient 
that isn t like you  
why 
he s scared   
he is afraid with his own shadow 
isn t that why they come to you 
this fellow could be somebody
great  and he s fighting me 
perhaps  he doesn t want to be great 
perhaps that s what you want 
i might have overstepped the mark 
apologize 
do you both good 
i m very sorry  mr logue 
the duke is  busy 
i m happy to wait 
or i could come back later 
as i said 
the duke is terribly busy 
thank you 
the parliament will not support their marriage 
but there were other reasons for concern  sir 
he was careless with state papers 
he lacked commitment and resolve 
there were those that worried where
he would stand when war comes with germany  
we re not coming to that 
indeed we are  sir 
prime minister baldwin may deny this 
but hitler s intent is crystal clear 
war with germany will come  and we will need
a king behind whom we can all stand united 
i fear   my brother is not of
sound mind  at this time 
have you thought what you will call yourself 
certainly not albert  sir 
too germanic 
what about george 
after your father  george the sixth 
it has rather a nice continuity to it 
don t you think 
david  thank god 
you look exhausted 
how are you bearing up 
bertie   the decision s been made 
i have to go 
i cannot accept that 
you are in no condition to make that decision 
i m afraid there s no other way 
i must marry her 
my mind s made up 
i m    sorry 
that s a terrible thing to hear 
david  nobody wants that 
i least of all 
  at long last i am able to say 
a few words of my own 
i have never wanted to withhold anything 
but until now 
it has not been constitutionally
possible for me to speak 
a few hours ago i discharged
my last duty as king and emperor 
now that i have been succeeded by
my brother  the duke of york
my first words must be
to declare my allegiance to him 
this i do with all my heart 
you all know the reasons which have
impelled me to renounce the throne 
but you must believe me 
when i tell you
i have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of
responsibility and to discharge my duties  
as king as i would wish to do without
the help and support of the woman i love   
and i want you to know 
  this decision has been made less
difficult to me
by the sure knowledge that my brother  with his
long training in the public affairs of this country   
   and with his fine qualities   
   will be able to take my place forth with
without interruption or
injury to the life and progress of the empire  
i meet you today   
in circumstances which are  
mama  will we have space for our
horses in our new home 
of course we will  darling  we ll
have a palace of rooms 
curtsey 
your majesty 
how was it 
i m trying to familiarise myself
with what a state paper looks like 
a despatch from mr baldwin
which i don t understand a word of 
david s finances 
the christmas broadcast  
i think that might be a mistake 
plans for the coronation  
i think that s an even bigger mistake 
i m not a king 
i m a naval officer 
its the only thing i know 
i m not a king 
dear  dear man   
you  know   
i refused your first two marriage proposals 
not because i didn t love you 
but because i couldn t bear the royal cage 
couldn t bear the idea of a life
of tours and public duties 
a life that no longer
was really to be my own 
but then i thought   
he stammers so beautifully   
they ll leave us alone 
waiting for a king to apologize 
one can wait rather a long wait 
i m afraid we re slightly late 
this is home  myrtle s at bridge 
i ve made sure the boys are out 
it s lovely 
absolutely lovely 
would you like some tea  ma am 
yes  i ll help myself 
off you go   
or must i knock your heads together 
here s your shilling 
i understand   
what you were tryingto say  logue 
i went about it the wrong way 
i m sorry 
now here i am 
is the nation ready
for two minutes of radio silence 
every stammerer always fears they
will fall back to square one 
i don t let that happen 
if i fail in my duty   
david could come back 
i ve seen the placards
 save our king  
they don t mean me 
every other monarch in history
succeeded someone who was dead 
or just about to be 
my predecessor is not
only alive  but very much so 
what a bloody mess 
i can t even give
them a christmas speech 
like your dad used to do 
precisely 
he s not here anymore 
yes he is  he s on that shilling i gave you 
easy enough to give away  you don t have
to carry him around in your pocket 
or your brother 
you don t need to be afraid of the things
as you were afraid of when you were five 
you re very much your own man  bertie 
am i 
your face is next  mate 
lionel 
myrtle 
  is it alright 
  yes 
bertie  come here 
  are you alright  logue 
  yes 
  shall we go through 
  trust me  it s important 
what is it 
  your    your   
  it s  your majesty   the first time 
after that  it s  ma am   as in ham 
not ma lm as in palm 
i haven t told her about us 
sit down  relax 
i m told your husband calls
my husband bertie
and my husband calls your husband lionel 
i trust you won t call me liz 
your majesty  you may call me
mrs logue  ma am 
very nice to meet you  mrs logue 
logue  we can t stand here all day 
yes we can  look  i need to wait
for the right moment 
  logue  you re being a coward 
  you re damn right 
get out there  man 
hello  myrtle darling 
you re early  i believe you two have met 
but i didn t think  you know   
king george the sixth 
  it s very nice to meet you 
will their majesties be staying
to dinner 
we would love to  such a treat 
but alas   
a previous engagement  what a pitty 
  archbishop 
  welcome  your majesty 
what a glorious tranformation  sir 
i hope you ll forgive us if we continue
out preparations 
and now you will allow me to guide you
through the ceremony 
we begin of course at the west door 
then into the nave 
i see you all your pronouncements are
to be broadcast  archbishop 
ah  yes  wireless is indeed a pandora s box 
i m afraid i also have to permit
the newsreel cameras 
the product of which i shall personally
edit 
without momentary hesitation 
this is doctor logue of harley street 
he s my speech therapist 
  your grace    had i known that your
majesty was seeking assistance
i should ve made my own recommendation 
dr  logue   
will be attending the coronation 
well of course i shall speak with the dean 
but it was extremely difficult 
i should like the doctor to be seated
in the king s box 
but members of your family will be seated
there  sir 
that is why it s suitable 
and now  if you don t mind your grace 
we need the premises 
my dear fellow  this is westminster abbey 
the church must prepare his majesty 
my preparations are equalized in important
with complete privacy  if you don t mind 
those are my wishes  your grace 
i shall place the abbey at your majesty s
disposal    this evening  your majesty 
i can t believe i m walking on chaucer
and handel and dickens 
everything alright  let s get cracking 
i m not here to rehearse  doctor logue 
call me lionel 
true  you    never   
called yourself  doctor  
i did that    for you 
no training  no    diploma 
no    qualifications 
just a    great deal of nerve 
the star chamber inquisition  is this 
you asked trust and    total equality 
bertie  i heard you at wembley 
i was there 
my son laurie said  dad  do you think
you could help that poor man  
what  as a failed actor  
it s true  i m not a doctor 
and yes i acted a bit 
well i recited in pubs
and taught elocution in schools 
when the great war came 
all our soldiers were returning
straight from the front 
a lot of them shell shocked 
unable to speak
somebody said   lionel  you re very good
at all this speech stuff 
do you thin you can possibly help
these poor buggers  
i did muscle therapy  exercise  relaxation 
but i knew i had to go deeper 
these poor young blokes had cried out
in fear  no one was listening to them 
my job was to give them faith
in their own voice
and let them know that a friend
was listening 
that must ring a few bells with you 
bertie 
you give a very noble account of yourself 
make inquiries  it s all true 
inquiries have been made  you have no idea
who i have breathing down my neck 
i vouched for you and you have no   
credentials 
but lots of success 
i can t show you certificate  
there was no training then 
everything i know i know from experience 
and that war    was some experience 
my plaque says 
 l  logue  speech defects  
no dr   there are no letters
after my name 
lock me in the tower 
  i would if i could 
  on what charge 
  fraud 
with war looming  you ve saddled
this nation with a voiceless king 
you destroyed the happiness of my family 
all for the sake of ensnaring a star   
patient you couldn t possibly hope
to assist 
it ll be like mad   
king george the third 
there ll be
mad king george the stammerer 
who let his people down so badly
in their hour of need 
what re you doing  get up 
you can t sit there  get up 
why not  it s a chair 
no  that s not a chair 
that is    that is   
that is saint edward s chair 
  people have carved their names on it 
that chair is the seat on which every
king and queen   
  it s held in a place by a large rock 
  that s the stone of scone 
you are trivialising everything 
  you believe such bollocks 
  you re trivialising everything 
  i don t care how many royal   
  listen to me  listen to me 
      arse have sat in this chair 
  listen to me     
  listen to you   by what right 
by the divine right  if you must 
i m your king   
no you re not  you told me so yourself 
you said you didn t want it 
why should i waste my time listening to you 
  because i have a right to be heard 
  heard as what  
  i have a voice   
yes you do 
you have such a perservance  bertie 
you re the bravest man i know 
and you ll make a bloody good king 
  what on earth s going on  sir 
  it s quite alright  archbishop 
mr logue  you must know that i found
a replacement english specialist
with impeccable credentials  hence  your
services will no longer be required 
  i m sorry    your majesty s function
is to consult and be advised 
and you didn t consuly  but you ve just
been advised 
now i advise you  in this personal matter
i will make my own decision 
my concern is for the head upon
which i must place the crown 
i appreciate that archbshop 
but it s my head 
your humble servant 
thank you bertie 
shall we rehearse 
come on up on your purge 
now when you and elizabeth enter through
the west door 
you ll be greeted by the hymn
 i was glad when they said unto me  
actually you won t be that glad  because
they sing it for a very long time 
then your friend the archbishop
will ponce up the stairs toward you
and say  sir  is your majesty willing
to take the oath  
   i am willing  
   course you are 
i m gonna see what it sounds
like in the cheap seats
so even your old nanny can hear 
 will you govern your peoples of
great britain  ireland  canada 
australia and new zealand according to
their lands and customs  
   i solemnly promise so do so  
  louder  i can t hear you up the back 
 i solemnly promise to do so  
very good 
 will you to your power cause law
and justice  in mercy 
to be executed in all your judgements  
 i will    i will  
then there s a very long bit about
upholding the faith 
goes on  rubbish  rubbish  rubbish 
to which you finally say   
 the things which i have herebefore
promised  i will perform and keep 
so help me god  
and that s all you ll say 
four short responses 
kiss the book and sign the oath
and you re king 
easy 
you nearly crowned him backwards
archbishop 
someone had removed the thread
marking the back of the crown  sir 
try not lose the thread  archbishop 
archbishop  we re missing papa 
very good  very good  archbishop 
well  i hope your majesties are thrilled
with the result 
you could switch that machine off now 
no  wait  keep going 
do have a seat  archbishop 
movie commentary
movie commentary
  german speaking  
  german speaking  
  german speaking  
  german speaking  
  papa    mmm    papa  what s he saying 
i don t know  but he seems to be
saying it rather well 
sir  i have asked to see you today in order
to tender my resignation as prime minister 
i am so sorry to hear that  mr baldwin 
neville chamberlain will take my place
as prime minister 
it s a matter of principal 
i was mistaken 
i have found it impossible to believe
that there is any man in the world
so lacking in moral feeling as hitler 
but the world might be hurled for a second
time into the abyss of destructive war 
churchill was right all along 
this was always hitler s intention 
i am many very sorry to leave you in
this great time of crisis 
i am very much afraid sir  that your
greatest test is yet to come 
i am speaking to you from the cabinet
room at 10 downing street 
this morning the british ambassador
in berlin
handed the german government a final note
stating that unless we heard from them
by 11 o clock
that they were prepared at once to
withdraw their troops from poland 
a state of war would exist between us 
i have to tell you now that no such
undertaking has been received 
and that consequently this country is
at war with germany 
at last sir  here is your speech 
you are on air at six 
i ve timed it at just under nine minutes 
the wording is fully approved 
the prime minister will be joining you
for the broadcast
which will go out live across the nation 
the empire and to our armed forces 
get logue here immediately 
  there s the barrage balloons 
  yes 
they got them up there quickly  yeah 
  should we pull over and find shelter 
  no  go straight on  we ll be alright
  yes  sir    lionel logue 
major hartley s expecting me 
this is my son laury 
  thank you  laurie 
  good luck  dad 
  the king s speech 
  thank you  sir 
we have about forty minutes until
the broadcast 
thank you very much  thank you 
 there may be dark days ahead  and    
try again 
 there may be dark days ahead  and    
turn the hesitations into pauses  and say
to yourself   god save the king  
i say that continuously 
but apparently no one s listening 
long pauses are good  they add
solemnity to great occasions 
then i m the solemnest king who ever lived 
and lionel  if i am to be king   
where is my power 
can i    can i form a government  can i   
can i levy a tax or declare a war  no 
yet i am the seat of all authority  why 
because the nation believes that
when i speak  i speak for them 
yet i cannot speak 
let s take it all again from the top 
 in this grave hour    
 in this grave hour fuck fuck fuck
perhaps the most fateful in our history
bugger shit shit
i send to every household of my   
you see  p  is always difficult 
even when i m singing 
bounce onto it  a peoples   not  people  
 a people household of  me

beaut 
   this message  doo dah  spoken with
the same depth of feeling  doo dah dey 
   for each one of you as if i were able
to shit fuck bugger
cross your threshold and speak to you 
in your head  now   i have a right to be
bloody well heard  
bloody well heard  bloody well heard 
bloody well heard myself 
now waltz  move  get continuous movement 
 for the second time in the lives of most
of us we are at    
   we are     take a pause 
  lionel  i can t do this 
bertie  you can do it 
   have a look at the last paragraph 
  bertie  it s time 
there he is 
  archbishop 
  your majesty 
a great moment  sir 
  prime minister 
  your majesty 
nice to see you again  so soon 
good of you to be here  i m sure
you ve had rather a busy day 
let s hope we have no more interruptions
from those damned sirens  sir 
or the wretched dogs 
  congratulations  first lord of
the admiralty    your majesty 
the long walk 
good luck  sir 
i too dread this apparatus  had a speech
impediment myself  you know 
  i didn t 
  family secret  tongue tied 
an operation was considered to be
too dangerous 
i eventually made an asset of it 
  thank you  mr churchill 
  good  sir 
darling 
  how long  logue 
  just under three minutes  sir 
five seconds  sir 
5  4  3   2   1 
  mr wood 
  good luck  your majesty 
mr wood 
  you ll be decorated  logue 
  i made it cosy 
some fresh air 
there you are  darling 
i m thistle sifter  i ve a sieve of sifted
thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles 
i ve a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve
on unsifted thistles  because i m   
bertie  darling  make sure it s not switched on 
remember the red light will blink four times
and then i ve asked them to turn it off 
because we don t want that evil eye
staring at you all the way through 
one minute  sir 
i am sure you will be splendid 
fourty seconds  sir 
logue  however this turns out 
i don t know how to thank you
for what you ve done 
knighthood 
twenty seconds 
forget everything else and just say
it to me  say it to me  as a friend 
in this grave hour 
perhaps the most fateful in our history 
i send to every household of my peoples 
both at home
and overseas
this message
spoken with the same depth of feeling
for each one of you
as if i were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you myself 
for the second time in the lives of
most of us
we are at    at war 
over and over again
we have tried to find
a peaceful way out of the differences
between ourselves
and those who are now our enemies 
but it has been in vain 
we have been forced into a conflict 
for we are called  to meet the challenge
of a principle
which  if it were to prevail 
would be fatal to any civilized order
in the world 
such a principle 
stripped of all disguise 
is surely the mere
primitive doctrine that might is right 
for the sake of all that we ourselves
hold dear 
it is unthinkable that we should refuse
to meet the challenge 
it is to this high purpose
that i now call
my people at home and my peoples across
the seas 
who will make our cause their own 
i ask them to stand calm and firm 
and united in this time of trial
the task will be hard 
there may be dark days ahead 
and war can no longer be confined
to the battlefield 
but we can only do the right
as we see the right
and reverently commit our cause to god 
if one and all we keep resolutely
faithful to it 
then  with god s help 
we shall prevail 
very good  bertie 
you still stammered on the  w  
had to throw in a few so they knew
it was me 
congratulations  your majesty

thank you  mr wood 
congratulations  your majesty
