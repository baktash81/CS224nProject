if you remain un obliging
of course
how did you find me your royal highness
the president of the speech therapists society
eileen mccleod
shes a sport
dr mccleod warned me your antipodean methods
were unorthodox and controversial
i warned her
those were not my favorite words
i can cure your husband
but for my  method to work i need trust and total equality
here in the safety of my consultation room
no exceptions
well then in that case
when can you start
still sounds a bit rough mate
you make me drive too slowly dad
did you pick mum up from bridge
yes ive hardly been out of the car all day
i had a special visitor this afternoon
may i please leave this table
how special special
no you must stay
bored stupid listening to your
parents inane conversation
thanks dad
and mum
me too
you meeting jean
no someone else
doctor doctor cant you help
your brother with the washing
im fine
whos it lionel
why bring it up
if you cant talk about it
myrtle its just a woman
looking to help her husband
oh
and i had a call
for an audition
one of my favorites
arent they all
it could be a lot of fun
im sure youll be splendid
theyre a highly regarded group
from putney
tomorrow chapter iv
the flight
oh to fly away
werent they lucky
now papa tell a  story
could i be a penguin instead
once there were two princesses
princess elizabeth and princess margaret
whose papa was a penguin
this was because he  had been
turned into one by the wicket witch
this was an
inconvenient for him
because he loved to hold
his princesses in his arms
and you cant because he
dont have wings like herrings
herrings dont have wings
penguins have wings
which is shaped like herrings
and make matters worse
is that she
sent him to the south pole
which is an awfully long walkback
if you cant fly
sowhen he reached the water
he dived in through the dept so fast
that he was in southampton
waters by lunchtime
and from there
he took the 230 to weybridge
changed at clapham junction and asked
a passing mallard the way to buckingham palace
he swam up the thames
out through the  plughole
and gave the cook
mama and mrs whittaker quite a shock
now when the girls heard all the commotions
they ran to the kitchen where
they gave him a good scrub
a mackerel and a kiss
and as they kissed him
guess what he turned into
a handsome prince
a shorttailed albatross
with wings so big
that he could wrap them both
his two girls together
now now
its time for bed
will mrs simpson  be there
my brothers insisting
is he serious
about her coming to dinner
no about her
a married woman he cant be
she can
by the way
i think i found someone rather interesting
on harley street a doctor
out of the question
im not having this conversation again
the matters settled
his approach seems rather different
now
now
now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer
by this sun of york
and all the clouds
that lourd upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
now are our brows
bound with victorious wreaths
thank you
lovely diction mr
logue lionel logue
well mrlogue
im not hearing the cries of a deformed
creature yearning to be king
nor did i realize richard the third
was king of the colonies
i do know the lines
ive played the role before
sydney
perth
major theater town is it
enthusiastic
ah
i was well reviewed
yes
welllionel
i think our dramatic society
is looking for someone slightly younger
and a
little more regal
where did you find thisphysician
classifieds
next to french model
shepherds market
he comes highly recommended
charges substantial fees
in order to help the poor
oh dear
perhaps hes a bolshevik
no receptionist
he likes to keep things simple
the johnsons
you can go in now mr johnson
lionel says
wait here if you  wish mrs johnson
or it being a p
pleasant day
pperhaps take a stroll

mrs johnson
mr johnson do come in
hes a good lad willy
he could hardly make a sound you know
when he first came to me
my boys made those
good arent they
please make yourself comfortable
i was told not to sit too close
well i believe when speaking with a prince
one waits for the prince to choose a topic
waiting for me to
commence
a conversation
one can wait a rather long wait
do you know any jokes
timing isnt my strong suit
cuppa tea
no thank you
arent you going to start treating me
dr logue
only if youre interested in being treated
please
call me lionel
i prefer doctor
i prefer lionel
whatll i call you
your royal highness
then sir after that
a bit formal for here
what about your name
prince albert frederick arthur
george
how about bertie
only my family uses that
perfect
in here its better if were equals
if we were equal i wouldnt be
here
id be at home with my wife
and noone would give a damn
please dont do that
im sorry
i believe sucking smoke
into your lungs will kill you
my physicians say
it relaxes the throat
theyre idiots
theyve all been knighted
makes it official then
my castle my rules
what was your earliest memory
what
an earth do you mean
your first recollection
im not
here to discuss my personal matters
whyre you here then
because i bloody well stammer
you have a bit of a temper
one of my many faults
when did the defect start
ive always been this way
i doubt that
dont tell me its my stammer
its my field
i can assure you
no infant starts to speak with a stammer
when did yours start
four or five
thats typical
so ive been told
i cant remember not doing it
i can believe that do you hesitate
when you think
dont be ridiculous
how about
when you talk to yourself
everyone natters occasionally
bertie
stop calling me that
im not going to call you anything
else
then we shant speak
are you charging for this doctor
a fortune
so when you
talk to yourself do you stammer
of course not
well that proves your impediment isnt
a permanent part of you
what do
you think was the cause
i dont know
i dont care
i stammer
and no one can fix it
i bet you  you can read
flawlessly right here right now
and if i win i get to ask
questions
and if i win
you dont have to answer
one usually
wagers money
a bob each to sweeten it
lets see your shilling
i dont
carry money
i had a funny feeling you mightnt
ill stake you
you can  pay me back next time
who says there is a next time
i havent agreed
to take you on yet
please stand
and take a look at that
i cant  read this
then you owe me a shilling
for not trying
to be
or not to bethat
i cant read
i havent finished yet
im going to record your voice and
then play it back to you on the same machine
this is brilliant
its the latest thing from america
its a silvertone
pop this on
theres a bob in this mate you
can go home rich
youre playing music
i know
how can i hear what im saying
surely a princes brain knows what
its mouth is doing
youre not well acquainted with
royal princes are you
hopeless
hopeless
you were sublime would i lie to a
prince of the realm to win twelvepence
ive no idea what an australian
might do for that sort of money
let me play it back to you
no
all right then
i get to ask you the question
thank you doctor
i dont feel
this is for me
thank you for your time
bye
sir
the recording is free
please
keep it as a souvenir
king george v os
for the present the work to which
we are all equally bound
is to arrive at a reasoned
tranquillity
within our borders to regain
prosperity in this time of depression without selfseeking
and to carry with us those whom the
burden of past years has disheartened or overborne
to all
to each
i wish a happy christmas
god bless you
easy when you know how
have a go yourself
congratulations sir
ah mr wood
splendid fellow chap taught me everything i know
let the microphone do the work
sit up
straight back
face boldly up to the bloody thing
and stare it square in the eye
as you would any decent englishman
show whos in command
papa i dddont
thuthuthink i cccan read this
this devilish device will change
everything if you dont
in the past all a king had to do was look
respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse
now we must invade peoples homes
and ingratiate ourselves with them
this family is reduced to those lowest
basest of all creatures
weve becomeactors
were not a family
were a firm
yet at any moment
some of us may be out of work
your darling brother
and future king
the only wife he appears interested in
is invariably the wife of another
hes broken off
with lady furness
and taken up a mrs simpson
a woman
with two husbands living
i told him straight
no divorced person could ever be received at court
he said
it made him sublimely happy
i imagined that was because she was
sleeping with him
i give you my word
this is what he said
i give you my
word weve never had immoral relations
stared square into his fathers eyes
and lied
when im dead that boy will ruin
himself this family and this nation within twelve months
wholl pick up the pieces
herr hitler intimidating half of
europe marshall stalin the other half
wholl stand between us the
jackboots and the proletarian abyss
you
with your older brother shirking his duties
youre going to have to do a lot more of this
have a go yourself
son
get it out boy
mmarvels of m
modern
just take your time
form your words carefully
science i am enabled this
relax
just try it
do it
lying
bastard
to be or not to be
that is the question
whether tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
or to take arms against a sea of
troubles and by opposing end them
to die
to sleep no more
strictly  business
no p
personal nonsense
i thought id made that very clear
in our interview
got the shilling you owe me
no i havent
didnt think so
besides
you tricked me
physical excercises and tricks are important
what youre asking will only deal
with the surface of the problem
thats sufficient
as far as i see it
my hausband
has mechanical difficulties with his speech
maybe
just deal with that
im willing to work hard doctor logue
lionel
are you
are you willing to do your part
alright
you want mechanics
we need to relax your throat muscles
and strengthen your tongue
by repeating tongue twisters for example
i am a thistlesifter i have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles
because i am a thistle sifter
fine
you have a flabby tummy
we must build up the strength in your diaphragm
simple mechanics
that is all we ask
and thats about a shillings worth
forget about the blessed shilling
perhaps upon occasion
you might be requested
some assistance in cope with a minor event
will that agreeable
of course
that will be the full extent of your services
shall i see you next week
i shall see you every day
ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah
feel the loosening of the jaw
take a nice deep breath
expand your chest
how do you feel
full of hot air
isnt that what public speaking is all about
are you alright bertie
this is actually quite good fun
hello bertie
hello david
whereve you been
been busy

elizabeth has pneumonia
im sorry shell recover
father wont
ill drive
old buggers doing this on purpose
dying
departing prematurely
to complicate matters
oh for heavens sake david you
know how long hes been ill
wallis explained shes terribly
clever about this thing
lord wigram
whereas by letters patent underthe great seal bearing date of
westminster the eleventh june 1912
his majesty king george v did constitute
order and declare that there should be a guardian
custos regni
in the form of councillors of state
its the order of the council for
the state sir
so we may act on your behalf
im still confused
approved
thank you
feeling a little better sir
no im not feeling any better i
feel dreadful
have you been ice skating
ice skating
no george
i know darling a talk even a
lovely long talk is a poor substitute
for holding tight and making drowsy
nor making our own drowsies either
as weve had to dofar too often lately
david dinner
im on with wallis
wallis misses me terribly
mama says youre late for dinner
she forgets papas bloody clocks
were always half an hour fast
how is the king
i hope he is not in pain
no no his majesty
hes quieter now
thank you
david if your father were well tardiness
would not be tolerated
none of this
unpleasantness would be tolerated
you know sir i appreciate that yo
are different from your father in your outlook and temperament
i want you to know that whenever
the king questioned your conduct
i  tried in your interest to present
it in a most favourable light
i can always trust you to have my
best interests at heart
i fear our vigil will not be of
long duration
please continue
we commend our brother george to
the mercy of god our maker and redeemer
long live the king
i hope
i will make good as he has made good
what on earth was that
poor wallis
now im trapped
time for a shake dad
you sure
go on
put your thinking caps on
bet its the scottish play
no i bet its othello
its always othello
art thou afeard
caliban
oh for heavens sake that was a
lucky guess
dont listen to egghead
go on dad
the isle is full ofnoisessounds and sweet airs
that give delight and hurt not
sometimes a thousand twanging instruments
will hum about mine ears
and sometimes voicesthat if then i had waked after
long sleepwill make me sleep again
alright clever clogs
what comes next
and then in dreaming
the clouds me thought would open
and show riches ready to drop upon me
that when im awake
when i waked i cried to dream again
its such a sad thought
my next patient must be early
you better go lads im sorry
wont be a moment clifford
bertie
they told me not to expect you
i am sorry about your father
i dont wish to intrude
oh no
course please come in
ive been practising one hour a
day in spite of everything
whats going on there
i was sorry
mucking around with my kids

i wasnt there for my fathers
death still makes me sad
i can imagine so
what did you father do
he was a brewer
at least there was free beer
heres to the memory of your father
i was informed
after the fact
that  my fathers last words were
bertie has more guts than the rest of his
brothers put together
he couldnt say that to my face
my brother
what about him
try singing
im sorry

father wouldnt allow it
he collected stamps

you can finish that off
if you sing
im not going to sit here
wobbling
you can with me
because youre peculiar
i take that as a compliment
im not crooning swanee river
try camptown races then
my brother d he said to me doo
dah doodah continuous sound will give you flow
does it feel strange
now that davids on the throne
to tell the truth
it was a relief
knowing i wouldnt be king
but unless he produces an heir
youre next in line
and your daughter elizabeth
would then succeed you
youre barking up the wrong tree
now doctor doctor
lionel see
you didnstammer
of course i didnt stammer i was singing
well as a little reward you get
to put some glue on these struts
your boy
wont mind
no not at all
david and i were very close young
bucks you know
chase the same girls
david was always very helpful in arranging introductions
we shared the expert ministrations of paulette in paris
not at the same time of course
did david tease you
yes they all did
buhbuhbuhbertie
father encouraged it get it out
boy said it would make me stop
saidi was afraid of my father
and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me
are you naturally right handed
left
i was punished now i use the right
yes thats very common with stammerers
anything other corrections
knock knees
metal splints were madeworn
night and day
that must have been painful
bloody agony
straight legs now
who were you closest to in your family
nannies not my first nanny
thoughshe loved davidhated me
when we are presented to my parents
for the daily viewing shed pinch me
id cry and
be handed back to her
immediately
then
she would
sing it
then she wouldnt feed me
far far away
took three years for my parents to notice
as you can imagine it
caused some stomach problems still
what about your brother johnnie
were you close to him
johnny
sweet boy
epilepsyand
he was different
died at 13 hidden from view
ive been told its not catching
do you want a topup
please
you know lionel youre the first
ordinary englishman
australian
ive ever really spoken to
sometimes when i ride through the
streets and see you know
the common man staring at me
im struck by how little i know of hislife
and how little he knows of mine
thank you
whatre friends for
i wouldnt know
i sifted seven thickstalked
thistles through strong thicksieves i sifted seven
one hundred year old
oaksremoved to improve the view
who does she think she is
nonethelesswe must try to be
pleasant towards mrs simpson
you know she calls me the fat
scottish cook
youre not fat
im getting plump
you seldom cook
i sifted seven
shut up
their royal highnesses the duke and
duchess of york
how lovely to see you both
welcome
to our little country shack
i came at the invitation of the
king
hello david
youre making some changes to
the garden i see
yes i am
i am not quite finished
dont tell me i behaved badly mr churchill
on the contrary your royal
highness etiquette decrees royalty
must be greeted by the official host in this case the king
not a commoner
thank you
what is her hold on him
i have no idea
apparently she has
certainskills
in an establishment in shanghai
david
ive been trying to see you
ive been terribly busy
doing what
kinging
kinging
is a precarious business
these days
where is the russian tsar
where is cousin wilhelm
youre being dreary
is kinging laying off eighty staff at sandringham
and buying yet more pearls for wallis while there ar
people marching across europe singing the red flag
stop your worrying herr hitler
will sort that lot out
wholl sort out herr hitler
and youve put that woman into our
mothers suite
mothers not still in the bed
is she
thats not funny
wally likes the very best
i dont care what woman you carry
on with at night
as long as you show up for duty in the morning
wally is not just some woman i am
carrying on with
we intend to marry
excuse me
shes filing a petition for
divorce
good god
cant you just give her a nice
house and a title
i wont have her as my mistress
david the church does not
recognise divorce and you are the head of the church
havent i any rights
many privileges
not the same thing
your beloved common man may marry for love
why not me
if you were the common man on what
basis could you possibly claim to be king
sounds like youve studied our
wretched constitution
sounds like you havent
is that what this is all about brushing up
hence the elocution lessons
im trying to tt
yearning for a larger audience are we
bbbbertie
ddont
younger brother trying to push older
brother off throne
pa pa
positively medieval
where have you been all this time
never you mind
ahhwhat a complicated
lovely coon you are
i try to be
all that work down the drain
my own brother
i couldnt say
i couldnt say a word in reply
why do you stammer more with david
than you do with me
because youre bloody well paid to listen
bertie
im not a geisha girl
stop trying to be so bloody clever
what is it about david that stops you speaking
what is it about you that bloody makes
want you to go on about it all the time
vulgar but fluent you dont
stammer when you swear
bugger off
is that the best you can do
well bloody bugger to you
you beastly bastard
a public school prig can do better
than that
shit
shit shit shit
shit
see how defecation flows trippingly
from the tongue
because im angry
you know the fword
fornication
oh bertie
fuck fuck fuck fuck
yes you see not a hesitation
bloody bloody bloody shit shit
shit bugger bugger bugger fuck fuck fuck
dad whats going on
sorry finish your homework
well thats a side of you we dont
get to see that often
no no were not supposed to
really not publicly
lets get some air
no logue i dont think thats a
good idea
whats the matter
whats got you so upset
logue you have no idea
my brother is infatuated with a woman whos
been married twice
shes asking for a divorce and
david is determined to marry her
mrs wallis simpson of baltimore
thats not right
queen wallis of baltimore
unthinkable
can he do that
absolutely not
but hes going to anyway
all hells broken loose
cant they carry on privately
if only they would
where does that leave you
i know my place
ill do anything
in my power to keep my brother on the throne
is it that serious
your place may be on the throne
i am not an alternative to my
brother
if you had to you could outshine david
dont take liberties
thats bordering on treason
im just saying you could be king
you could do it
that is treason
im trying to get you to realise
you need not be governed by fear
ive had enough of this
whatre you afraid of
your poisonous words
whyd you come to me
you are not some middle class bugger
who needs elocution lessons so you can chitchat
dont instruct me on my duties
im the son of a
king
the brother of a king
youre the disappointing son of a brewer
a jumpedup jackeroo from the
outback
youre nobody
these sessions are over
its not because shes an american
that is the least of it
its because she is a soon to
be a twice divorced american
and the king as  head of the church of england
can not marry a divorced woman
and sir
i apologize for the nature of this
according to scotland yard
the king has not always possess exclusiverights
to mrs simpsons
favours and affections
sharing them with a
married used car salesman
a certain mr guy trundle
in addition it is also rumoured
hitlers ambassador count von ribbentrop
sends her 17 carnations every day
should your brother continue to
ignore the advice of his government he must abdicate
otherwise his government has no
choice but to resign
prime minister
youd leave the
country without a government
does the king do what he wants
or does he do what his people expect him to do
whats the matter love
im just having trouble with a patient
that isnt like you
why
hes scared
he is afraid with his own shadow
isnt that why they come to you
this fellow could be somebody
great and hes fighting me
perhaps he doesnt want to be great
perhaps thats what you want
i might have overstepped the mark
apologize
do you both good
im very sorry mr logue
the duke is  busy
im happy to wait
or i could come back later
as i said
the duke is terribly busy
thank you
the parliament will not support their marriage
but there were other reasons for concern sir
he was careless with state papers
he lacked commitment and resolve
there were those that worried where
he would stand when war comes with germany
were not coming to that
indeed we are sir
prime minister baldwin may deny this
but hitlers intent is crystal clear
war with germany will come and we will need
a king behind whom we can all stand united
i fearmy brother is not of
sound mind at this time
have you thought what you will call yourself
certainly not albert sir
too germanic
what about george
after your father george the sixth
it has rather a nice continuity to it
dont you think
david thank god
you look exhausted
how are you bearing up
bertie  the decisions been made
i have to go
i cannot accept that
you are in no condition to make that decision
im afraid theres no other way
i must marry her
my minds made up
im sorry
thats a terrible thing to hear
david nobody wants that
i least of all
at long last i am able to say
a few words of my own
i have never wanted to withhold anything
but until now
it has not been constitutionally
possible for me to speak
a few hours ago i discharged
my last duty as king and emperor
now that i have been succeeded by
my brother the duke of york
my first words must be
to declare my allegiance to him
this i do with all my heart
you all know the reasons which have
impelled me to renounce the throne
but you must believe me
when i tell you
i have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of
responsibility and to discharge my duties
as king as i would wish to do without
the help and support of the woman i love
and i want you to know
this decision has been made less
difficult to me
by the sure knowledge that my brother with his
long training in the public affairs of this country
and with his fine qualities
will be able to take my place forth with
without interruption or
injury to the life and progress of the empire
i meet you today
in circumstances which are
mama will we have space for our
horses in our new home
of course we will darling well
have a palace of rooms
curtsey
your majesty
how was it
im trying to familiarise myself
with what a state paper looks like
a despatch from mr baldwin
which i dont understand a word of
davids finances
the christmas broadcast
i think that might be a mistake
plans for the coronation
i think thats an even bigger mistake
im not a king
im a naval officer
its the only thing i know
im not a king
dear dear man
you  know
i refused your first two marriage proposals
not because i didnt love you
but because i couldnt bear the royal cage
couldnt bear the idea of a life
of tours and public duties
a life that no longer
was really to be my own
but then i thought
he stammers so beautifully
theyll leave us alone
waiting for a king to apologize

for two minutes of radio silence
every stammerer always fears they
will fall back to square one
i dont let that happen
if i fail in my duty
david could come back
ive seen the placards
save our king
they dont mean me
every other monarch in history
succeeded someone who was dead
or just about to be
my predecessor is not
only alive but very much so
what a bloody mess
i cant even give
them a christmas speech
like your dad used to do
precisely
hes not here anymore
yes he is hes on that shilling i gave you
easy enough to give away you dont have
to carry him around in your pocket
or your brother
you dont need to be afraid of the things
as you were afraid of when you were five

mrs logue maam
very nice to meet you mrs logue
logue we cant stand here all day
yes we can look i need to wait
for the right moment
logue youre being a coward
youre damn right
get out there man
hello myrtle darling
youre early i believe you two have met
but i didnt think you know
king george the sixth
its very nice to meet you
will their majesties be staying
to dinner
we would love to such a treat
but alas
a previous engagement what a pitty
archbishop
welcome your majesty
what a glorious tranformation sir
i hope youll forgive us if we continue
out preparations
and now you will allow me to guide you
through the ceremony
we begin of course at the west door
then into the nave
i see you all your pronouncements are
to be broadcast archbishop
ah yes wireless is indeed a pandoras box
im afraid i also have to permit
the newsreel cameras
the product of which i shall personally
edit
without momentary hesitation
this is doctor logue of harley street
hes my speech therapist
your grace  had i known that your
majesty was seeking assistance
i shouldve made my own recommendation
dr logue
will be attending the coronation
well of course i shall speak with the dean
but it was extremely difficult
i should like the doctor to be seated
in the kings box
but members of your family will be seated
there sir
that is why its suitable
and now if you dont mind your grace
we need the premises
my dear fellow this is westminster abbey
the church must prepare his majesty
my preparations are equalized in important
with complete privacy if you dont mind
those are my wishes your grace
i shall place the abbey at your majestys
disposal this evening your majesty
i cant believe im walking on chaucer
and handel and dickens
everything alright lets get cracking
im not here to rehearse doctor logue
call me lionel
true you never
called yourself doctor
i did that for you
no training no diploma
no qualifications
just a great deal of nerve
the star chamber inquisition is this
you asked trust and total equality
bertie i heard you at wembley
i was there
my son laurie said dad do you think
you could help that poor man
what as a failed actor
its true im not a doctor
and yes i acted a bit
well i recited in pubs
and taught elocution in schools
when the great war came
all our soldiers were returning
straight from the front
a lot of them shellshocked
unable to speak
somebody said lionel youre very good
at all this speech stuff
do you thin you can possibly help
these poor buggers
i did muscle therapy exercise relaxation
but i knew i had to go deeper
these poor young blokes had cried out
in fear noone was listening to them
my job was to give them faith
in their own voice
and let them know that a friend
was listening
that must ring a few bells with you
bertie
you give a very noble account of yourself
make inquiries its all true
inquiries have been made you have no idea
who i have breathing down my neck
i vouched for you and you have no
credentials
but lots of success
i cant show you certificate
there was no training then
everything i know i know from experience
and that war was some experience
my plaque says
l logue speech defects
no dr there are no letters
after my name
lock me in the tower
i would if i could
on what charge
fraud
with war looming youve saddled
this nation with a voiceless king
you destroyed the happiness of my family
all for the sake of ensnaring a star
patient you couldnt possibly hope
to assist
itll be like mad
king george the third
therell be
mad king george the stammerer
who let his people down so badly
in their hour of need
whatre you doing get up
you cant sit there get up
why not its a chair
no thats not a chair
that is that is
that is saint edwards chair
people have carved their names on it
that chair is the seat on which every
king and queen
its held in a place by a large rock
thats the stone of scone
you are trivialising everything
you believe such bollocks
youre trivialising everything
i dont care how many royal
listen to me listen to me
arse have sat in this chair
listen to me
listen to you by what right
by the divine right if you must
im your king
no youre not you told me so yourself
you said you didnt want it
why should i waste my time listening to you
because i have a right to be heard
heard as what
i have a voice
yes you do
you have such a perservance bertie
youre the bravest man i know
and youll make a bloody good king
what on earths going on sir
its quite alright archbishop
mr logue you must know that i found
a replacement english specialist
with impeccable credentials hence your
services will no longer be required
im sorry  your majestys function
is to consult and be advised
and you didnt consuly but youve just
been advised
now i advise you in this personal matter
i will make my own decision
my concern is for the head upon
which i must place the crown
i appreciate that archbshop
but its my head
your humble servant
thank you bertie
shall we rehearse
come on up on your purge
now when you and elizabeth enter through
the west door
youll be greeted by the hymn
i was glad when they said unto me
actually you wont be that glad because
they sing it for a very long time
then your friend the archbishop
will ponce up the stairs toward you
and say sir is your majesty willing
to take the oath
i am willing
course you are
im gonna see what it sounds
like in the cheap seats
so even your old nanny can hear
will you govern your peoples of
great britain ireland canada
australia and new zealand according to
their lands and customs
i solemnly promise so do so
louder i cant hear you up the back
i solemnly promise to do so
very good
will you to your power cause law
and justice in mercy
to be executed in all your judgements
i will i will
then theres a very long bit about
upholding the faith
goes on rubbish rubbish rubbish
to which you finally say
the things which i have herebefore
promised i will perform and keep
so help me god
and thats all youll say
four short responses
kiss the book and sign the oath
and youre king
easy
you nearly crowned him backwards
archbishop
someone had removed the thread
marking the back of the crown sir
try not lose the thread archbishop
archbishop were missing papa
very good very good archbishop
well i hope your majesties are thrilled
with the result
you could switch that machine off now
no wait keep going
do have a seat archbishop
movie commentary
movie commentary
german speaking
german speaking
german speaking
german speaking
papa  mmm  papa whats he saying
i dont know but he seems to be
saying it rather well
sir i have asked to see you today in order
to tender my resignation as prime minister
i am so sorry to hear that mr baldwin
neville chamberlain will take my place
as prime minister
its a matter of principal
i was mistaken
i have found it impossible to believe
that there is any man in the world
so lacking in moral feeling as hitler
but the world might be hurled for a second
time into the abyss of destructive war
churchill was right all along
this was always hitlers intention
i am many very sorry to leave you in
this great time of crisis
i am very much afraid sir that your
greatest test is yet to come
i am speaking to you from the cabinet
room at 10 downing street
this morning the british ambassador
in berlin
handed the german government a final note
stating that unless we heard from them
by 11 oclock
that they were prepared at once to
withdraw their troops from poland
a state of war would exist between us
i have to tell you now that no such
undertaking has been received
and that consequently this country is
at war with germany
at last sir here is your speech
you are on air at six
ive timed it at just under nine minutes
the wording is fully approved
the prime minister will be joining you
for the broadcast
which will go out live across the nation
the empire and to our armed forces
get logue here immediately
theres the barrage balloons
yes
they got them up there quickly yeah
should we pull over and find shelter
no go straight on well be alright
yes sir  lionel logue
major hartleys expecting me
this is my son laury
thank you laurie
good luck dad
the kings speech
thank you sir
we have about forty minutes until
the broadcast
thank you very much thank you
there may be dark days ahead and
try again
there may be dark days ahead and
turn the hesitations into pauses and say
to yourself god save the king
i say that continuously
but apparently no ones listening
long pauses are good they add
solemnity to great occasions
then im the solemnest king who ever lived
and lionel if i am to be king
where is my power
can i can i form a government can i
can i levy a tax or declare a war no
yet i am the seat of all authority why
because the nation believes that
when i speak i speak for them
yet i cannot speak
lets take it all again from the top
in this grave hour
in this grave hour fuck fuck fuck
perhaps the most fateful in our history
bugger shit shit
i send to every household of my
you see p is always difficult
even when im singing
bounce onto it apeoples not people
apeople household of  me
apeoples both at home and overseas
beaut
this message doodah spoken with
the same depth of feeling doodahdey
for each one of you as if i were able
to shit fuck bugger
cross your threshold and speak to you
in your head now i have a right to be
bloody well heard
bloody well heard bloody well heard
bloody well heard myself
now waltz move get continuous movement
for the second time in the lives of most
of us we are at
we are take a pause
lionel i cant do this
bertie you can do it
have a look at the last paragraph
bertie its time
there he is
archbishop
your majesty
a great moment sir
prime minister
your majesty
nice to see you again so soon
good of you to be here im sure
youve had rather a busy day
lets hope we have no more interruptions
from those damned sirens sir
or the wretched dogs
congratulations first lord of
the admiralty  your majesty
the long walk
good luck sir
i too dread this apparatus had a speech
impediment myself you know
i didnt
family secret tonguetied
an operation was considered to be
too dangerous
i eventually made an asset of it
thank you mr churchill
good sir
darling
how long logue
just under three minutes sir
five seconds sir
5 4 3  2  1
mr wood
good luck your majesty
mr wood
youll be decorated logue
i made it cosy
some fresh air
there you are darling
im thistle sifter ive a sieve of sifted
thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles
ive a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve
on unsifted thistles because im
bertie darling make sure its not switched on
remember the red light will blink four times
and then ive asked them to turn it off
because we dont want that evil eye
staring at you all the way through
one minute sir
i am sure you will be splendid
fourty seconds sir
logue however this turns out
i dont know how to thank you
for what youve done
knighthood
twenty seconds
forget everything else and just say
it to me say it to me as a friend
in this grave hour
perhaps the most fateful in our history
i send to every household of my peoples
both at home
and overseas
this message
spoken with the same depth of feeling
for each one of you
as if i were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you myself
for the second time in the lives of
most of us
we are at at war
over and over again
we have tried to find
a peaceful way out of the differences
between ourselves
and those who are now our enemies
but it has been in vain
we have been forced into a conflict
for we are called to meet the challenge
of a principle
which if it were to prevail
would be fatal to any civilized order
in the world
such a principle
stripped of all disguise
is surely the mere
primitive doctrine that might is right
for the sake of all that we ourselves
hold dear
it is unthinkable that we should refuse
to meet the challenge
it is to this high purpose
that i now call
my people at home and my peoples across
the seas
who will make our cause their own
i ask them to stand calm and firm
and united in this time of trial
the task will be hard
there may be dark days ahead
and war can no longer be confined
to the battlefield
but we can only do the right
as we see the right
and reverently commit our cause to god
if one and all we keep resolutely
faithful to it
then with gods help
we shall prevail
very good bertie
you still stammered on the w
had to throw in a few so they knew
it was me
congratulations your majesty
a true broadcaster
