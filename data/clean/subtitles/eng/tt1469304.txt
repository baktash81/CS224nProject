narrator  matt brody  u s  swimmer 
sex symbol and adrenaline junkie 
brody  how do i define myself 
80  trill and 30  dope 
people think i m crazy 
that i m out of control 
how do you think i
got all this gold 
narrator   crazy and out of control 
may have worked for
his individual events 
but when it came to the relay 
brody blew it for the team 
commentator  usa is in the
lead for the team relay
and brody s in the water to anchor 
oh  my god 
looks like he just
vomited in the pool 
narrator  after a night
of partying in rio
led to a streak of
bad luck in the pool 
brody was dubbed the  vomit comet  
how do you feel about losing
a medal for your teammates 
there s no  i  in  team  
but there is a  me  
are you dyslexic 
i m caucasian 
   brody chuckles 
   remote clicks 
this is the guy you think is
a good pr opportunity for us 
wow  right 
he s reckless  he s insubordinate  come on 
which is why we can afford him 
come on  mitch 
the guy s only here
because he took a plea deal 
 scoffs  a plea deal 
for what 
 clears throat  the
specifics aren t important 
what s important is that we
are his community service 
come on  he s a train wreck 
with two gold medals 
how many gold medals do you have 
probably zero  okay 
brody is an american hero with
the face of a swedish model 
you re losing me 
he s one of the best
swimmers in the whole world 
there s more to this
job than just swimming 
  you know that 
  yeah  there s also politics 
now  look  mitch  let s be honest 
we re staring into the abyss here 
city council s already
cut our funding again 
what the council wants
and what the bay needs
are two different things 
i found more flakka this morning 
clearly  we have new dealers in the bay 
and this shit is like bath salts on meth 
wow  flakka 
good work  mitch 
i ll turn this over to the police 
hey  look  this new guy of yours 
he s not ready for this kind of trouble 
he doesn t need to be 
and neither do you  okay 
it s not your job 
it s the busiest time of the year 
i need you out there shining for me 
  all right  i ll do it 
  yes 
but he s got to pass qualifiers first 
  you got it 
  which should be easy
considering he s the  best
swimmer in the world  
right 
victoria  good afternoon  councilman 
  good afternoon 
  so  how is our progress 
most of the council has
signed off on your terms 
good 
and the rest are almost there 
 almost  
 clicks tongue  ugh  councilman 
you seem like the kind of man who
knows how to seize an opportunity 
me  too 
back home  my younger brother was
given the family business to run
when clearly i had the business gene 
why  because i m a woman 
so i came to america 
the land of opportunity 
because everything is fair here 
but who s to say anymore 
i have a point to prove  councilman 
and i m here to create
an opportunity for you 
 exhales 
i m sure they ll come around 
i m sure they will  too 
why does she always look
like she s running in slo mo 
you see it  too 
she always looks wet  but not too wet 
right 
she s the reason i believe in god 
hey  how s your dick

give it up for lieutenant
mitch buchannon 
 cheering and applause 
all right  thank you  thank you 
baywatch is the elite of the elite 
our team s commitment to
protecting the bay at all costs

 children giggling 
 indistinct chatter 
stephanie  thanks 
mitch  that s right 
and baywatch works
because we follow rules 
we follow rules because

that make a great lifeguard 
today  we re gonna test all of them

 the absentee father  
he s tough  brutal  even 
his presence in your life is
brief  but it will scar you
and instill a toughness in you that
will carry you through birthdays 
christmases and even  bring
your dad to school day 
when your mom has to
put on a fake moustache
just so you can fit in
with the other kids 
mitch  all right

i m not a bond villain 
well  yet 
you re in politics 
you know that no one can
claw their way to the top

dirt under their fingernails

you don t have a jurisdiction  lifeguard 
you got one job  make sure
swim happy white people don t drown 
technically  that boat out there is
the coast guard s jurisdiction  okay 
and if i would ve waited for them 
all these girls would be dead 
  what 
  we would have died 
  burned to a crisp 
  i m not ready to die 
i know  it s okay  you re not 
so technically  we saved lives 
technically  i see a dead body 
which technically makes this a crime scene 
hey  technically  these  technically s 
are wasting a lot of time  technically 
thank you  blue eyed demon 
 sighs 
and as far as this dead body goes  look 
badge on a uniform 
patch on a swimsuit 
lieutenant  beat cop 
so keep us informed

we re gonna do the same 
all right  hey  how do i keep in touch 
seashell phone

the conch and you appear 
that s the spirit  ellerbee 
just call me on the shell
phone  that s all you gotta do 
i ll tell you this  if you crack this case 
they re gonna upgrade you to a segway
and they re gonna give
you big boy pants to wear 
cover up those chicken legs 
  oh  christ  that s   
  councilman rodriguez 
good luck  officer 
ronnie    i got
the eye of the tiger
  a fighter
  dancing through the fire
   cause i am the champion
  and you re gonna hear me roar
  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  
  damn  ronnie 
   screaming  c j  
please 
oh  shit 
i never really heard a guy sing that song 
but you re really good 
thank you 
uh  c j   what are you doing here 
here  oh  um  it s a coed shower 
coed  cool 
cool  cool  cool 
yeah  coed is cool with me 
 cause i m cool with the coeds 
i m taking lunch orders 
do you want anything 
 flapping lips 
i would like a salad 
you sure 
this place has really good cheesesteaks 
meatball subs  foot longs 
  they really hit the spot 
  no  i ll have a salad 
i m just a straight up
leafy green type of guy 
that s my type of jam 
just hook me up with a salad 
okay  salad 
  cool  all right 
  great 
by the way  uh  when we shower in
here  we  uh  keep our suits on 
  right  phil  sarah 
   both laughing 
but your  uh  clean nips
are looking really good 
   slaps 
  ah 
  thanks 
  bye 
oh  god 
why me 
 sighs 
how was your day today 
uh  i don t know  a guy died 
maybe this is why we keep losing recruits 
  they can t handle it 
  mitch  yeah 
i mean  now that you know our job
is much more than you expected 
right  the stakes are higher 
what happened today  while very
tragic  unfortunately  it does happen 
so if you want to quit 
hey  we totally get it 
but if you don t and you choose to stay 
just know that baywatch is more than a job 
it s a way of life 
 a way of life  
 slurping 
you and i both know i m sticking around 
am i the only one that got a salad 
look  this is what i
don t understand  okay 
a guy dies  that s tragic 
but that doesn t mean that
there s anything sinister going on 
okay  and even if there was 
that s not our job  that s not what we do 
we re lifeguards  so  this 
technically  has nothing to do with us 
you just heard that cop 
he just told us that 
i just thought you had to be
on a really restrictive diet
to look like you guys 
brody  what is it that you
think we do here at baywatch 
i thought we were lifeguards 
i thought that we prevent
people from getting sunburned
and  yeah  occasionally
stop them from drowning 
and that s all you think that this is 
it s exactly what i thought it was 
c j   how about you throw a few
of last month s cases at olympiad
here and see what he d do 
   cases  
  okay  um   
school of manta ray in the cove 
you call animal control 
before animal control shows up 
the school of manta ray
fly up out of the water 
sting someone in the chest and they die 
steve irwin  r i p 
how about  uh  sand grifters
running a con on the beach  right 
well  i m not exactly sure what
a sand grifter is  stephanie 
but i would probably call the cops 
sand grifters are  uh  beach thieves 
okay  so while you re working on your tan 
they re stealing things
from families on the beach 
i ll give you one better 
how about diamond smugglers who
are putting the rocks in surfboards
and bringing them ashore 
everything that you guys are talking about
sounds like a really  like 
entertaining  but far fetched tv show 
but if that was the case  i
would definitely call the cops 
we could call the cops 
and then do nothing 
like most people would  but that s not us 
it s not how we operate 
we watch when other
people don t want to watch 
we protect when other
people don t want to protect 
if we do the bare minimum 
sometimes people die 
guys  we have flakka
that just washed ashore 
that shit is hardcore and
it fucking kills people 
and now we got a dead body in our bay 
and the girls on that boat
had the same drugs on them
that i found in front of leeds s club 
so my gut says that it s all connected 
wait  leeds did say there d be
an open house tonight  right 
yes  she did 
and we re all going 
 party music playing 
 keyboard clacking 
 door opens 
what d you find on chen 
no criminal record  no fetishes 
no weird photos  he s clean 
makes me feel weird about the
stuff i have going on in my life 
what about his bank accounts 
account 
this dude is not rich at all 
all his money is tied up
in real estate in the bay 
well  i guess you ll have
to help me persuade him
some other way 
every man has a price 
speaking of which 
i know you ve been using
my special set of skills
for your own nefarious purposes 
but additional compensation
would go a long way in motivating
me to keep my mouth shut 
 chuckles 
you re blackmailing me 
  huh  well  i wouldn t   
  dave   
i really admire a man who knows
how to seize an opportunity 
i m very impressed 
  keep up the good work 
  thanks 
  do we have a deal  or   
   door closes 
i need some closure 
  hey 
  hi 
wow  you look really nice 
hey  you look really nice  too  baby gap 
that shirt come in big boy size 
well  at least i m undercover 
look at you  you didn t even try 
all right  guys  we got a very
big night  with one goal in mind 
it s our only shot to prove
that they re dealing here 
so we gotta make it right 
so  c j  and ronnie 
find out who s selling 
summer  keep an eye on leeds and her thugs 
then mitch and i will search the
place for where she hides the product 
  brody 
  what 
  you re our lookout 
  lookout 
guys  if you want to find drugs at a party 
i can walk in there and find drugs 
it d take me  like  five minutes 
not  cause i do it all the time 
i m just saying it s not rocket science 
okay  troubled youth  thank you for that 
the only way this whole
thing is gonna work out
is if everyone  everyone  does their job 
  can you handle that  malibu ken 
  yeah 
what 
why is everyone looking at me  summer 
hey  am i the only one that thinks
this is clearly a job for the police 
  yes

 hip hop music playing

baywatch is our family 
these are the keys to our house

so  what  that could
have happened any time

dive down a flight of stairs
and not break that many vertebrae 
this was done on purpose 
why has no one else figured this out 
what are you talking
about  figured what out 
broken neck in multiple places 
no smoke in his lungs 
which probably means he died
before that boat was even on fire 
the reason why no one has figured this out 
it s murder

i should go interrogate those girls 
no  those girls were too high 
they don t remember anything

  you re right 
it s bath time  shithead 
all right  ellerbee  what
did we learn from the perps
after the interrogation 
the only perps here are you three 
okay  you turned the canals
into the goddamned x games 
yeah  that s  cause we
were in lifeguard pursuit 
oh  okay  my bad 
except for there s no fucking
such thing as  lifeguard pursuit  
police do pursuits 
when you do it  it s just some
guys chasing some other guys 
  no offense 
  none taken 
hey  what are you saying  you re
just gonna let those guys walk 
okay  um  how do i explain this
so that you people understand 
 you people  
 you people  
oh  you don t get to say that 
you re just tan 
  right on 
  come on  brother 
look  even if you were police 
which you re not 
and even if this was your
jurisdiction  which it isn t 
and even if you had
probable cause to pursue 
which you definitely don t 
what you did would
still be totally illegal 
okay  well  i mean  it s a good
thing we re not police  then 
it s like you purposely
only hear 1  of what i say 
mitch  did you pull brody off the beach
to break into the medical
examiner s office earlier today 
yeah  you bet i did 
absolutely  100  and here s why 
the councilman s boating
accident was no accident at all 
he had no smoke in his lungs 
his neck was broken in multiple places 
which means he was probably dead
before that boat even caught on fire 
and our investigation has found
that all of this shady shit
leads right back to the huntley 
you don t do investigations 
you re lifeguards 
police do investigations 
when you do it 
it s just a bunch of guys
investigating another bunch of guys 
  no offense  you re included in that 
  none taken 
do you have any proof of this conspiracy 
yeah  absolutely  we
read the coroner s report 
it s all in there before
those other guys switched it 
yeah  and i recorded the
whole thing on my cell phone 
  where s the cell phone 
  they destroyed it 
oh  okay 
so the only evidence that
you had was destroyed 
exactly  all the evidence    pfft 
gone  doesn t exist 
they re bad guys and they
don t want us to have it 
okay 
let me try to explain this to you
in a way that you people can understand 
 you people   there it is again 
  hey  hey  be cool 
  there it is again 
just trying to figure out what the fuck was
with  you people  
all right  now  look 
leave law enforcement to the police  okay 
and you guys just do the
jobs that i hired you to do 
you remember  the lifeguarding stuff 
  splish  splash 
  otherwise  i ll fire you 
now i gotta go clean up
this mess that you made 
boom 
captain thorpe  obviously  you have
every reason to be upset  and i apologize 
brody  so  do you always do the
opposite of what people ask you to do 
because i don t know 
man  it looks clear to me 
nice and quiet 
mitch  no  man  you got
to look closer  i knew it 
flynn s seafood company

oh  my god  that s dave

   computer beeping 
uh  so dave had access to leeds s server 
uh  her server  you mean her network 
yeah  her network  that s what i meant 
okay  so we just take a flash
drive and we plug it in  you know 
get into her cloud and then
steal all her cookies  right 
and then we re     mimics explosion 
straight through the
firewall   mimics crashing 
literally none of what

i meant evidence 
  oh  evidence 
  evidence 
well  why didn t you say so  man 
  heck  yeah 
  thank god you re pretty 
i m really proud of you  man 
guys  we did some digging 
and mitch was right 
the huntley is a front
for a giant drug operation 
but i figured out it s
not about drugs for leeds 
it s about real estate 
and she s planning on making
the entire bay private 
  yeah  but the town would never let her 
  yes  it will 
because she has every single
politician in this town
on her payroll 
rodriguez  the taint guy 
  what about the business owners 
  yeah 
well  most of them sold out and
signed away their properties 
leeds blackmailed the ones who didn t
and used dave to help
hack into their accounts 
i mean  she s like some sort
of modern day j  edgar hoover 
the vacuum guy 
no 
but there was one holdout 
  who 
  chen 
and if anything happens to him 
his property goes back to the city 
who do you think they re gonna sell it to 
  we have to warn him 
  i tried 
  no one s seen him for days 
  what 
but leeds is having a
party on her yacht tonight 
i guarantee you  she found a way
to get that guy into her boat 
which is why we re gonna go to that party 
what 
summer  you and i are
going to find the flakka 
you guys find chen 
will it work  maybe 
will there be some surprises along the way 
abso fucking lutely 
is anyone going to die 
 sighs  i don t know  maybe ronnie 
sorry  what 
but we are baywatch 
we save lives 
i know because you guys saved mine 
let s go kick that bitch s ass 
  let s do it 
  for mitch 
 club music playing 
 indistinct chattering 
thank you 
  lifeguards  this is a surprise 
  oh  hi
