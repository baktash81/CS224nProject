sex symbol and adrenaline junkie
brody how do i define myself
80 trill and 30 dope
people think im crazy
that im out of control
how do you think i
got all this gold
narrator crazy and out of control
may have worked for
his individual events
but when it came to the relay
brody blew it for the team
commentator usa is in the
lead for the team relay
and brodys in the water to anchor
oh my god
looks like he just
vomited in the pool
narrator after a night
of partying in rio
led to a streak of
bad luck in the pool
brody was dubbed the vomit comet
how do you feel about losing
a medal for your teammates
theres no i in team
but there is a me
are you dyslexic
im caucasian
brody chuckles
remote clicks
this is the guy you think is
a good pr opportunity for us
wow right
hes reckless hes insubordinate come on
which is why we can afford him
come on mitch
the guys only here
because he took a plea deal
scoffs a plea deal
for what
clears throat the
specifics arent important
whats important is that we
are his community service
come on hes a train wreck
with two gold medals
how many gold medals do you have
probably zero okay
brody is an american hero with
the face of a swedish model
youre losing me
hes one of the best
swimmers in the whole world
theres more to this
job than just swimming
you know that
yeah theres also politics
now look mitch lets be honest
were staring into the abyss here
city councils already
cut our funding again
what the council wants
and what the bay needs
are two different things
i found more flakka this morning
clearly we have new dealers in the bay
and this shit is like bath salts on meth
wow flakka
good work mitch
ill turn this over to the police
hey look this new guy of yours
hes not ready for this kind of trouble
he doesnt need to be
and neither do you okay
its not your job
its the busiest time of the year
i need you out there shining for me
all right ill do it
yes
but hes got to pass qualifiers first
you got it
which should be easy
considering hes the best
swimmer in the world
right
victoria good afternoon councilman
good afternoon
so how is our progress
most of the council has
signed off on your terms
good
and the rest are almost there
almost
clicks tongue ugh councilman
you seem like the kind of man who
knows how to seize an opportunity
me too
back home my younger brother was
given the family business to run
when clearly i had the business gene
why because im a woman
so i came to america
the land of opportunity
because everything is fair here
but whos to say anymore
i have a point to prove councilman
and im here to create
an opportunity for you
exhales
im sure theyll come around
im sure they will too
why does she always look
like shes running in slomo
you see it too
she always looks wet but not too wet
right
shes the reason i believe in god
hey hows your dick
oh uh its good you know
stammers its better you know

give it up for lieutenant
mitch buchannon
cheering and applause
all right thank you thank you
baywatch is the elite of the elite
our teams commitment to
protecting the bay at all costs

single mom behind me
feels very comfortable
letting her two kids run
right into the water unaccompanied
children giggling
indistinct chatter
stephanie thanks
mitch thats right

because we follow rules
we follow rules because
if we dont people die
you work in an office

desk one day no big deal

all people die
so heres the thing if
youve come to baywatch
on your little motorcycle
thinking youre cool
trying to work on your killer tan
well you need to find
another beach to go to

bigger than yourself

through this first cj

that make a great lifeguard
today were gonna test all of them
in a grueling obstacle

his presence in your life is
brief but it will scar you
and instill a toughness in you that
will carry you through birthdays
christmases and even bring
your dad to school day

put on a fake moustache
just so you can fit in
with the other kids

mitch come on

the boat was already on fire
mitch sighs

just write this down
can we just go
victim is male five foot nine
hey hey hey get back
right now do not contaminate
my crime scene
come on ellerbee
dont give me any of
that jurisdiction shit
uh no i wont because technically
you dont have a jurisdiction lifeguard
you got one job make sure
swimhappy white people dont drown
technically that boat out there is
the coast guards jurisdiction okay
and if i wouldve waited for them
all these girls would be dead
what
we would have died
burned to a crisp
im not ready to die
i know its okay youre not
so technically we saved lives
technically i see a dead body
which technically makes this a crime scene
hey technically these technicallys
are wasting a lot of time technically
thank you blueeyed demon
sighs
and as far as this dead body goes look
badge on a uniform
patch on a swimsuit
lieutenant beat cop
so keep us informed
of the investigation and
were gonna do the same
all right hey how do i keep in touch
seashell phone
or do i just blow into
the conch and you appear
thats the spirit ellerbee
just call me on the shell
phone thats all you gotta do
ill tell you this if you crack this case
theyre gonna upgrade you to a segway
and theyre gonna give
you bigboy pants to wear
cover up those chicken legs
oh christ thats
councilman rodriguez
good luck officer
ronnie  i got
the eye of the tiger
a fighter
dancing through the fire
cause i am the champion
and youre gonna hear me roar
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
damn ronnie
screaming cj
please
oh shit
i never really heard a guy sing that song
but youre really good
thank you
uh cj what are you doing here
here oh um its a coed shower
coed cool
cool cool cool
yeah coed is cool with me
cause im cool with the coeds
im taking lunch orders
do you want anything
flapping lips
i would like a salad
you sure
this place has really good cheesesteaks
meatball subs footlongs
they really hit the spot
no ill have a salad
im just a straightup
leafy green type of guy
thats my type of jam
just hook me up with a salad
okay salad
cool all right
great
by the way uh when we shower in
here we uh keep our suits on
right phil sarah
both laughing
but your uh clean nips
are looking really good
slaps
ah
thanks
bye
oh god
why me
sighs
how was your day today
uh i dont know a guy died
maybe this is why we keep losing recruits
they cant handle it
mitch yeah
i mean now that you know our job
is much more than you expected
right the stakes are higher
what happened today while very
tragic unfortunately it does happen
so if you want to quit
hey we totally get it
but if you dont and you choose to stay
just know that baywatch is more than a job
its a way of life
a way of life
slurping
you and i both know im sticking around
am i the only one that got a salad
look this is what i
dont understand okay
a guy dies thats tragic
but that doesnt mean that
theres anything sinister going on
okay and even if there was
thats not our job thats not what we do
were lifeguards so this
technically has nothing to do with us
you just heard that cop
he just told us that
i just thought you had to be
on a really restrictive diet
to look like you guys
brody what is it that you
think we do here at baywatch
i thought we were lifeguards
i thought that we prevent
people from getting sunburned
and yeah occasionally
stop them from drowning
and thats all you think that this is
its exactly what i thought it was
cj how about you throw a few
of last months cases at olympiad
here and see what hed do
cases
okay um
school of manta ray in the cove
you call animal control
before animal control shows up
the school of manta ray
fly up out of the water
sting someone in the chest and they die
steve irwin rip
how about uh sand grifters
running a con on the beach right
well im not exactly sure what
a sand grifter is stephanie
but i would probably call the cops
sand grifters are uh beach thieves
okay so while youre working on your tan
theyre stealing things
from families on the beach
ill give you one better
how about diamond smugglers who
are putting the rocks in surfboards
and bringing them ashore
everything that you guys are talking about
sounds like a really like
entertaining but farfetched tv show
but if that was the case i
would definitely call the cops
we could call the cops
and then do nothing
like most people would but thats not us
its not how we operate
we watch when other
people dont want to watch
we protect when other
people dont want to protect
if we do the bare minimum
sometimes people die
guys we have flakka
that just washed ashore
that shit is hardcore and
it fucking kills people
and now we got a dead body in our bay
and the girls on that boat
had the same drugs on them
that i found in front of leedss club
so my gut says that its all connected
wait leeds did say thered be
an open house tonight right
yes she did
and were all going
party music playing
keyboard clacking
door opens
whatd you find on chen
no criminal record no fetishes
no weird photos hes clean
makes me feel weird about the
stuff i have going on in my life
what about his bank accounts
account
this dude is not rich at all
all his money is tied up
in real estate in the bay
well i guess youll have
to help me persuade him
some other way
every man has a price
speaking of which
i know youve been using
my special set of skills
for your own nefarious purposes
but additional compensation
would go a long way in motivating
me to keep my mouth shut
chuckles
youre blackmailing me
huh well i wouldnt
dave
i really admire a man who knows
how to seize an opportunity
im very impressed
keep up the good work
thanks
do we have a deal or
door closes
i need some closure
hey

big night with one goal in mind

that theyre dealing here

place for where she hides the product

dive down a flight of stairs
and not break that many vertebrae
this was done on purpose
why has no one else figured this out
what are you talking

before that boat was even on fire
the reason why no one has figured this out
its murder

they dont remember anything

after the interrogation
the only perps here are you three
okay you turned the canals
into the goddamned x games
yeah thats cause we
were in lifeguard pursuit
oh okay my bad
except for theres no fucking
such thing as lifeguard pursuit
police do pursuits
when you do it its just some
guys chasing some other guys
no offense
none taken
hey what are you saying youre
just gonna let those guys walk
okay um how do i explain this
so that you people understand
you people
you people
oh you dont get to say that
youre just tan
right on
come on brother
look even if you were police
which youre not
and even if this was your
jurisdiction which it isnt
and even if you had
probable cause to pursue
which you definitely dont
what you did would
still be totally illegal
okay well i mean its a good
thing were not police then
its like you purposely
only hear 1 of what i say
mitch did you pull brody off the beach
to break into the medical
examiners office earlier today
yeah you bet i did
absolutely 100 and heres why
the councilmans boating
accident was no accident at all
he had no smoke in his lungs
his neck was broken in multiple places
which means he was probably dead
before that boat even caught on fire
and our investigation has found
that all of this shady shit
leads right back to the huntley
you dont do investigations
youre lifeguards
police do investigations
when you do it
its just a bunch of guys
investigating another bunch of guys
no offense youre included in that
none taken
do you have any proof of this conspiracy
yeah absolutely we
read the coroners report
its all in there before
those other guys switched it
yeah and i recorded the
whole thing on my cell phone
wheres the cell phone
they destroyed it
oh okay
so the only evidence that
you had was destroyed
exactly all the evidence pfft
gone doesnt exist
theyre bad guys and they
dont want us to have it
okay
let me try to explain this to you
in a way that you people can understand
you people there it is again
hey hey be cool
there it is again
just trying to figure out what the fuck was
with you people
all right now look
leave law enforcement to the police okay
and you guys just do the
jobs that i hired you to do
you remember the lifeguarding stuff
splish splash
otherwise ill fire you

the huntley is a front
for a giant drug operation
but i figured out its
not about drugs for leeds
its about real estate
and shes planning on making
the entire bay private
yeah but the town would never let her
yes it will
because she has every single
politician in this town
on her payroll
rodriguez the taint guy
what about the business owners
yeah
well most of them sold out and
signed away their properties
leeds blackmailed the ones who didnt
and used dave to help
hack into their accounts
i mean shes like some sort
of modernday j edgar hoover
the vacuum guy
no
but there was one holdout
who
chen
and if anything happens to him
his property goes back to the city
who do you think theyre gonna sell it to
we have to warn him
i tried
no ones seen him for days
what
but leeds is having a
party on her yacht tonight

to get that guy into her boat
