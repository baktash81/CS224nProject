a brass bra on doing pushups in the snow
so you drive
yeah sure
all right man great
well switch up in a bit
you ever been to jail
no ive never been to jail
ill tell you what buddy
its a whole lot
goddamn worse than war
its probably worse
than anywhere you been
i doubt that
are you kidding me
whats he pulling us over for
recreation
jackie and jean are the only things
you know for certain about that day
yes
are you aware that we have no last name
no place of residence
and no record of any physical
presence for these friends of yours
im afraid i might have to actually
hear that answer mr starks
yes
officer harrison
had been shot three times
he was long dead
by the time we got there
jack starks could be
blocking the incident
it would explain his wellconceived plan
about the little girl and her mother
objection
i have heard of gulf war syndrome
war is just a cnn special half the shit
that went on in operation desert storm
cant be tidied into
a topofthehour headline
couldnt be said neatly
so couldnt be said at all
there was someone else
wars ugly
and they dont put ugly on tv
my client thinks he already died once
i dont really remember all of it
he doesnt know whats going on
but there was someone else
i think thats what happened
if starks did kill that officer
cant hold a man responsible
for a damaged mind
we the jury find the defendant
not guilty by reason of insanity
jack starks i hereby sentence you
to be committed
to an institution
for the criminally insane
where i hope the doctors
and proper treatment can help you
come on bud
come on
what are you doing
get him up
please believe
what are you doing i dont belong here
i dont belong here
no i dont think you do either
but neither of us
can do anything about that now
please please
let me out of here
let me out of here please
how much did you give him
fifty ccs
and hes been in for the full three hours
yes sir
okay get him out
jack can you hear me
jack blink for me if you can
he didnt lose consciousness
do you wanna put him back in
no take him out of it
take him upstairs
and check his vitals every hour
now thats i think the context
in which to view whats going on
perhaps you may have seen a lead story
in the new york times
good morning dr lorenson
youre the cop killer right
that obvious huh
tv you know
helps soothe an active mind
im rudy mackenzie welcome
listen i
i dont really feel like talking
you know thats a shame
i dont believe
in disposable language either
you know small talk little talk
chitchat useless
the game
the games something else though
this here is our court
im ready to throw the ball come on
all right
what are you in here for
i tried to kill my wife
dont you go to jail for that
yeah well i tried like 30 times
i never planned on doing it you know
it was always
in the heat of the moment
and she kept threatening
to have me put away until finally
she did
thirty times might make you seem crazy
yeah or just or just plain stupid
because youd think by the 20th time
i wouldve found an alternative method
or maybe a more effective one
morning gentlemen how you doing today
for me that is a really
difficult question dr lorenson
because the world around me is shrinking
and the four horsemen of the apocalypse
are coming to see me today
and theyre not bringing flowers
which just makes it really difficult
to get organized
and you mr starks
im fine
so youre okay
you tell me doc
you think theres
something wrong with me
youre a little underweight
maybe im working it off in my dreams
done with the small talk
hey its okay
mr starks glad to see
youre cooperating this time
were here to help jack
were only doing whats best for you
hold him while i get the tranquilizer
get him down fuck the tranquilizer
no
no thats not necessary get him up
nurse get the jacket
the only thing
your minds missings a conscience
wait dr becker how long
do you want us to leave him in for
just strap him in for now
help help please
motherfucker
let me out of here
let me out of here
let me out of here
you okay
im fine
listen i hate to bother you
then dont
but what about starks
what about starks
should we be just
should we be trying to help him
any way we can
yes
should we be leaving him in there like that
the medication ive given him
is intended to adjust
maybe even reset his violent proclivities
peel away some layers of hate
the apparatus is merely
a safe place for that to happen
the grounds and the halls where i cant
monitor side effects i cant predict arent
but how can you be monitoring
the effects while hes in there
i consider the time hes spent
in there part of the treatment
you cant break something
thats already broken
i dont belong here
i cant breathe in here
i cant breathe in here
i cant
i cant breathe in here
im gonna blow your head off
in case you hadnt figured
its christmas eve
youre never gonna get a cab here

tom
tom can i speak with you
for a moment please
what have you done with jack starks
what do you mean
hes unconscious
hes recovering from loxadol and ativan
loxadol he didnt need neuroleptics
you know that from what a couple
of twominute stares across the room
he didnt need antipsychotics
if thats all you gave him
after he attacked me
i figured hed need a little placating
you sure he wasnt provoked
are you sure you wanna make
an accusation like that
im not making any accusations
hes bruised up
happens sometimes
when you gotta restrain them
listen to me
he is not gonna end up like ted casey
i dont know what youre trying to do
but hes not a lab animal
you cant reprogram them
no matter what cocktail of drugs
you really dont let up do you
just because you failed ted casey
doesnt mean the rest of us did
now if youll excuse me
its christmas remember
hi how are you sorry im late
hi babak

hey jamile

could i have some water
i have some water
here you go
what the hell kind of drugs
are you people giving me
just something to keep you calm
did you just say something
i said the drugs are to keep you calm
did you sleep well
i wasnt asleep was i
you were asleep for nearly a whole day
its december 26th jack
how are you feeling
december 26th
thats right
1992
yes
and thats the sun and youre on earth
and i know you know better jack
who the hell are you
my mom is dead 2007
jack starks is dead
get out of here get out
you left me in there
in where
you left me in that thing in the drawer
and then
you put me in a straitjacket
we were forced to use restraints
if thats what youre referring to
it wasnt a fucking restraint
thats exactly what our equipment is
relax
dont act like i dont know whats real
youre suffering from delusions
as part of your condition
no i know whats real i know
you strapped me into something
and stuffed me in a fucking drawer
it wasnt a dream
i dont know what youre trying to pull
but i wasnt
i have to say
this is the most resilient ive seen
a patient undergoing this treatment
i had a patient a few years ago
his name was ted casey
ted sodomized a 7yearold girl
his lawyers asked me to have a look at him
because after his deeds were done
he climbed into the trees
of the forest where he killed her
and howled like a dog
ted never went to prison because everyone
including me believed he was sick
so he came here then one day a little girl
came with her mother to visit her relative
and i caught ted stealing looks at her
the kind you really have to steal
if you know what i mean
i asked ted then
if he could remember what the little girl
who hed slain was wearing
oh yes he said i remember it
i remember it well
those were actually his last words
what happened to your face
i was careless it wont happen again
ill say a prayer for you jack
maybe god will pick up
where the medicine leaves off
you sure you know where to find him
jack
what are you doing jack
what are you gonna do to me
i thought id just ask you
to come inside with me
what if i didnt want to come
well id probably ask you why
because im not crazy
you suffer from a delusional disorder
it doesnt mean youre crazy
it just means youre confused
youre here instead of jail because
your condition
played a role in your crime
i didnt kill that cop but i dont remember
your minds ability to distinguish
between your fantasies
and the real events that happened
the real events that have happened to me
have been fucked up not my mind
jack
id like to ask you a question if i may
since when do people around here
start asking for things
okay smoke
thats what you wanna ask
no
i wanted
i wanted to ask you how your treatments
with dr becker are progressing
fine fine
i hope youd tell me
if that wasnt the case
why why what would you do
what would you do
i would try to make it stop
im not sure i want him to stop
so its helping
theyre making me feel like
a different person
you coming
were gonna freeze out here you and i
could get hurt if they catch you
trying to leave again
what do you know about the shit
they do to us in the basement
what shit
you know what im talking about
no i dont
yeah you do that jacket
what jacket
the fucking drawer
now stop playing games
you know what im talking about
i know that they take you down there
i know that they put you in it
the rest of it its
its a trip you know
its like a serious vacation
i found out im gonna die
well mortality is actually
a great thing to be familiar with
im gonna die in four days
thats what i found out
they find my body in four days
what are you two yapping about
were talking about our ability
to go forward in time
to go into the future
i mean thats what
were talking about right
yeah thats right
if you need to find something out
when youre in there just calm down
the less you freak
the less youll trip out
yeah but all this shit from before
just comes tumbling
yeah but that shit is in the past
focus on what you need to get now
i gotta get back in there
that could be a problem
why
lorensons got her claws into it now
when she started getting suspicious of me
was when they stopped putting me in there
women
what do you think i should do
you could still give becker an itch
you might get killed
when he goes to scratch it
but seems to me youre saying
thats about to happen anyway
oh man
please continue mr mackenzie
okay
well ive been approached
by the federal trade organization
and what have they approached you about
mr mackenzie
and this is nuts but
they have asked me to head up
the organization for the organized
the organization for the organized
yeah youve heard of them
no mr mackenzie i have not
thats because there is
no such organization you idiot
that is categorically not true
that is blatantly and manifestly not true
they have asked me to lead them
and if youd heard of them then they
wouldnt be hushhush would they
what do the rest of you think
well
i know they exist
and how is that
when i was in the gulf
the organization
was recruiting the organized
is that a fact mr starks
it is a fact
because if its not
it doesnt help mr mackenzie
it is a fact bona fide and classified
i knew it i knew it
you know those little fuckers
are everywhere
they only recruit the best mackenzie
calm down mr starks
stay calm see stay calm
always ordering us to stay calm be calm
be calm be calm
they order you to order me to be calm
how are we supposed
to be calm look at this place
so people wake up okay
orders come from the top only
dont let them order you around
long live the organization
long live the organization
for the organized
sit down mr starks
no no no youve gotta listen
long live the organization
for the organized
join the organization
the organization needs you
fight the good fight
you listen to him
you dont listen to me
sit down
you gotta listen to him
long live the organization
sit down
join the organization
you gotta listen to him
oh starks
you are real stubborn
but theres ways of fixing that
the less you freak
the less youll trip out
stay calm
criminally insane
gentlemen im gonna need you
to step out of the car
with your hands in the air please
what seems to be the problem officer
problem is youre moving too slow step out
of the car with your hands in the air
can i open the door here
hey soldier boy you awake
didnt think so
yeah
its okay youre okay
hey jack grab the ball
show mom honey
will you give me one sec
you got nerve showing up like this
you mind
okay here goes
jack starks died from a wound
to the head january 1 st 1993
how i mean how do i die
it didnt say
does that mean you believe me
i dont know what i believe
what else you find out
whole bunch of stuff
there was a doctor becker
he was using some kind of behavior
modification on his patients
that was banned in the 70s
and there was another doctor too
a dr lorenson
and something about a kid
she was treating babak
dont know who that is
i dont know
but the whole thing
was a major scandal
becker claimed he was trying to create
a womblike environment for his patients
fucking womb
it wasnt a fucking womb
look i have to find out how i die
well alpine grove still exists
we could go see if theres anyone around
who might know what really happened
we could
thanks for doing this
well i must be the crazy one right
im sorry i cant tell you more
about your uncles death
they used the hospital medical examiner
blunt trauma doesnt tell me anything
im sorry thats all it says
i mean werent there doctors
what about dr becker or dr lorenson
dr lorenson is still here at the hospital
she was here the same time as your uncle
im sure she could be
of more help to you
and what about becker and hopkins
dr hopkins died
and im not familiar with a dr becker
well can you see if thered be any kind
of forwarding address for dr becker
is there some particular reason
for these questions
hes the only family i remember
what does this guy keep smiling about
hi beth lorenson
how do you do
nice to meet you
hi beth lorenson
jackie price
sit down sit down
im sorry you look exactly like him
did you know him well
your uncle was my most
memorable patient
why is that
in the end
he made me change my mind
about a lot of things
he actually helped me with a case of mine
really what case
i was working with a little boy
babak yazdi
yes
who was he
a friends son
how do you know about him
we saw it when we were looking up
information about his uncle
how did he help
well its complicated but in the end
he let me know how
i could get through to him
how
its complicated
and it was a really long time ago
let me ask you something
do you know how my uncle died
yeah i think it was from
a head trauma
yes but how how did he get it
i dont know
you dont
think dr becker might have
a better idea
yes dr becker would know more
i dont believe a word she just said
me neither
come on theres one last thing
to remind you of the staff softball game
at 4 pm so dont be late
jack what is this
this is the room
they used to hang it over there
im actually in this drawer right now

how do you know about him jack
because you told me you told me

do whatever you did with becker
i was 27 years old the first time i died
i remember there was white everywhere
there was war and i felt alive
but really i was dead
sometimes i think
we live through things
only to be able to say that it happened
that it wasnt to someone else
it was to me
sometimes we live to beat the odds
im not crazy
even though they thought i was
i live in the same world as everyone else
i just saw more of it
as im sure you have
theyll find my body tomorrow
you can check it out
if you dont believe me
ive seen life after my death
and im telling you this
because its the only way
to help you and your daughter
have a better life of your own
jean
youre gonna pass out one day
smoking a cigarette
and burn to death
your daughter grows up living
the same sad life youre living right now
and she misses you so much
sometimes life can only really begin
with the knowledge of death
that it can all end
even when you least want it to
the important thing in life is to believe
that while youre alive
its never too late
i promise you jean
no matter how bad things look
they look better awake
than they do asleep
when you die theres only one thing
you want to happen
you wanna come back
