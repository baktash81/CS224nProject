we ll switch up in a bit 
you ever been to jail 
  no  i ve never been to jail 
  i ll tell you what  buddy   
   it s a whole lot
goddamn worse than war 
it s probably worse
than anywhere you been 
i doubt that 
are you kidding me 
what s he pulling us over for 
recreation 
jackie and jean are the only things
you know for certain about that day 
yes 
are you aware that we have no last name 
no place of residence   
   and no record of any physical
presence for these friends of yours 
i m afraid i might have to actually
hear that answer  mr  starks 
yes 
officer harrison
had been shot three times 
he was long dead
by the time we got there 
jack starks could be
blocking the incident 
it would explain his well conceived plan
about the little girl and her mother 
  objection 
  i have heard of gulf war syndrome 
war is just a cnn special  half the shit
that went on in operation desert storm   
   can t be tidied into
a top of the hour headline 
couldn t be said neatly 
so couldn t be said at all 
  there was someone else 
  war s ugly 
  and they don t put ugly on tv 
  my client thinks he already died once 
  i don t really remember all of it   
  he doesn t know what s going on 
   but there was someone else 
i think that s what happened 
if starks did kill that officer   
   can t hold a man responsible
for a damaged mind 
we  the jury  find the defendant
not guilty by reason of insanity 
jack starks  i hereby sentence you
to be committed   
   to an institution
for the criminally insane   
   where i hope the doctors
and proper treatment can help you 
come on  bud 
come on 
what are you doing 
get him up 
please believe   
what are you doing  i don t belong here 
  i don t belong here 
  no  i don t think you do either 
but neither of us
can do anything about that now 
please  please 
let me out of here 
let me out of here  please 
  how much did you give him 
  fifty cc s 
  and he s been in for the full three hours 
  yes  sir 
okay  get him out 
jack  can you hear me 
jack  blink for me if you can 
  he didn t lose consciousness 
  do you wanna put him back in 
no  take him out of it 
take him upstairs
and check his vitals every hour 
now that s  i think  the context
in which to view what s going on 
perhaps you may have seen a lead story
in the new york times 
good morning  dr  lorenson 
you re the cop killer  right 
  that obvious  huh 
  tv  you know 
helps soothe an active mind 
i m rudy mackenzie  welcome 
listen  i   
  i don t really feel like talking 
  you know  that s a shame 
i don t believe
in disposable language either 
you know  small talk  little talk 
chitchat  useless 
the game 
the game s something else  though 
this here is our court 
i m ready to throw the ball  come on 
all right 
what are you in here for 
  i tried to kill my wife 
  don t you go to jail for that 
yeah  well  i tried  like  30 times 
i never planned on doing it  you know 
it was always
in the heat of the moment 
and she kept threatening
to have me put away until finally   
   she did 
  thirty times might make you seem crazy 
  yeah  or just    or just plain stupid 
because you d think by the 20th time 
i would ve found an alternative method   
   or maybe a more effective one 
  morning  gentlemen  how you doing today 
for me that is a really
difficult question  dr  lorenson   
   because the world around me is shrinking 
and the four horsemen of the apocalypse   
   are coming to see me today 
and they re not bringing flowers   
   which just makes it really difficult
to get organized 
and you  mr  starks 
  i m fine 
  so you re okay 
you tell me  doc 
you think there s
something wrong with me 
you re a little underweight 
maybe i m working it off in my dreams 
done with the small talk 
hey  it s okay 
mr  starks  glad to see
you re cooperating this time 
we re here to help  jack 
we re only doing what s best for you 
hold him while i get the tranquilizer 
  get him down  fuck the tranquilizer 
  no 
no  that s not necessary  get him up 
nurse  get the jacket 
the only thing
your mind s missing s a conscience 
wait  dr  becker  how long
do you want us to leave him in for 
just strap him in for now 
help  help  please 
motherfucker 
let me out of here 
let me out of here 
let me out of here 
  you okay 
  i m fine 
  listen  i hate to bother you 
  then don t 
but what about starks 
what about starks 
should we be just    
should we be trying to help him
any way we can 
  yes 
  should we be leaving him in there like that 
the medication i ve given him
is intended to adjust   
   maybe even reset  his violent proclivities 
peel away some layers of hate 
the apparatus is merely
a safe place for that to happen 
the grounds and the halls  where i can t
monitor side effects i can t predict  aren t 
but how can you be monitoring
the effects while he s in there 
i consider the time he s spent
in there part of the treatment 
you can t break something
that s already broken 
i don t belong here 
i can t breathe in here 
i can t breathe in here 
i can t   
i can t breathe in here 
i m gonna blow your head off 
in case you hadn t figured 
it s christmas eve

  where are you going 
you ll freeze out there 
you don t even have a coat

jack 
jack 
tom 
tom  can i speak with you
for a moment  please 
  what have you done with jack starks 
  what do you mean 
  he s unconscious 
  he s recovering from loxadol and ativan 
loxadol  he didn t need neuroleptics 
you know that from what  a couple
of two minute stares across the room 
he didn t need antipsychotics 
if that s all you gave him 
after he attacked me 
i figured he d need a little placating 
you sure he wasn t provoked 
are you sure you wanna make
an accusation like that 
i m not making any accusations 
he s bruised up 
happens sometimes
when you gotta restrain them 
listen to me 
he is not gonna end up like ted casey 
i don t know what you re trying to do 
but he s not a lab animal 
you can t reprogram them 
no matter what cocktail of drugs   
you really don t let up  do you 
just because you failed ted casey   
   doesn t mean the rest of us did 
now  if you ll excuse me 
it s christmas  remember 
hi  how are you  sorry i m late 
  hi  babak 
  that s a nice wave 
  hey  jamile 
  hey 
okay  that s great  that was the truck 
now point to the ball 
very good 
wanna hold it  feels nice  strong 
i need you to stay with me
for just a little while more  okay 
we ll get there 
could i have some water 
could i have some water 
i have some water 
here you go 
what the hell kind of drugs
are you people giving me 
just something to keep you calm 
did you just say something 
i said  the drugs are to keep you calm 
did you sleep well 
  i wasn t asleep  was i 
  you were asleep for nearly a whole day 
it s december 26th  jack 
how are you feeling 
  december 26th 
  that s right 
  1992 
  yes 
and that s the sun  and you re on earth 
and i know you know better  jack 
who the hell are you 
my mom is dead  2007 
jack starks is dead 
get out of here  get out 
  you left me in there 
  in where 
you left me in that thing  in the drawer 
and then   
   you put me in a straitjacket 
we were forced to use restraints 
if that s what you re referring to 
  it wasn t a fucking restraint 
  that s exactly what our equipment is 
relax 
don t act like i don t know what s real 
you re suffering from delusions
as part of your condition 
no  i know what s real  i know 
you strapped me into something
and stuffed me in a fucking drawer 
it wasn t a dream 
i don t know what you re trying to pull 
but i wasn t   
i have to say   
   this is the most resilient i ve seen
a patient undergoing this treatment 
i had a patient a few years ago 
his name was ted casey 
ted sodomized a 7 year old girl 
his lawyers asked me to have a look at him
because after his deeds were done   
   he climbed into the trees
of the forest where he killed her   
   and howled like a dog 
ted never went to prison because everyone 
including me  believed he was sick 
so he came here  then one day a little girl
came with her mother to visit her relative   
   and i caught ted stealing looks at her 
the kind you really have to steal 
if you know what i mean 
i asked ted then   
   if he could remember what the little girl
who he d slain was wearing 
 oh  yes   he said   i remember it 
i remember it well  
those were actually his last words 
what happened to your face 
i was careless  it won t happen again 
i ll say a prayer for you  jack 
maybe god will pick up
where the medicine leaves off 
you sure you know where to find him 
jack 
what are you doing  jack 
what are you gonna do to me 
i thought i d just ask you
to come inside with me 
  what if i didn t want to come 
  well  i d probably ask you why 
because i m not crazy 
you suffer from a delusional disorder 
it doesn t mean you re crazy 
it just means you re confused 
you re here instead of jail because
your condition   
   played a role in your crime 
  i didn t kill that cop  but i don t remember 
your mind s ability to distinguish
between your fantasies   
   and the real events that happened   
the real events that have happened to me
have been fucked up  not my mind 
jack 
i d like to ask you a question  if i may 
since when do people around here
start asking for things 
  okay  smoke 
  that s what you wanna ask 
no 
i wanted   
i wanted to ask you how your treatments
with dr  becker are progressing 
fine  fine 
i hope you d tell me
if that wasn t the case 
why  why  what would you do 
what would you do 
i would try to make it stop 
  i m not sure i want him to stop 
  so it s helping 
they re making me feel like
a different person 
you coming 
we re gonna freeze out here  you and i 
could get hurt if they catch you
trying to leave again 
what do you know about the shit
they do to us in the basement 
what shit 
  you know what i m talking about 
  no  i don t 
yeah  you do  that jacket 
  what jacket 
  the fucking drawer 
now  stop playing games 
you know what i m talking about 
i know that they take you down there 
i know that they put you in it 
the rest of it  it s   
it s a trip  you know 
it s like a serious vacation 
i found out i m gonna die 
well  mortality is actually
a great thing to be familiar with 
i m gonna die in four days 
that s what i found out 
they find my body in four days 
what are you two yapping about 
we re talking about our ability
to go forward in time   
   to go into the future 
i mean  that s what
we re talking about  right 
yeah  that s right 
if you need to find something out
when you re in there  just calm down 
the less you freak 
the less you ll trip out 
yeah  but all this shit from before
just comes tumbling   
yeah  but that shit is in the past 
focus on what you need to get now 
  i gotta get back in there 
  that could be a problem 
  why 
  lorenson s got her claws into it now 
when she started getting suspicious of me
was when they stopped putting me in there 
women 
what do you think i should do 
you could still give becker an itch 
you might get killed
when he goes to scratch it   
   but seems to me  you re saying
that s about to happen anyway   
oh  man 
please continue  mr  mackenzie 
okay 
well  i ve been approached
by the federal trade organization 
and what have they approached you about 
mr  mackenzie 
and this is nuts  but   
   they have asked me to head up   
   the organization for the organized 
  the organization for the organized 
  yeah  you ve heard of them 
no  mr  mackenzie  i have not 
that s because there is
no such organization  you idiot 
that is categorically not true 
that is blatantly and manifestly not true 
they have asked me to lead them 
and if you d heard of them  then they
wouldn t be hush hush  would they 
what do the rest of you think 
well   
   i know they exist 
  and how is that 
when i was in the gulf 
the organization   
   was recruiting the organized 
  is that a fact  mr  starks 
  it is a fact 
because if it s not 
it doesn t help mr  mackenzie 
it is a fact  bona fide and classified 
i knew it  i knew it 
you know  those little fuckers
are everywhere 
they only recruit the best  mackenzie 
  calm down  mr  starks 
  stay calm  see  stay calm 
always ordering us to stay calm  be calm 
be calm  be calm 
they order you to order me to be calm 
how are we supposed
to be calm  look at this place 
so  people  wake up  okay 
orders come from the top only 
don t let them order you around 
long live the organization 
long live the organization
for the organized 
  sit down  mr  starks 
  no  no  no  you ve gotta listen   
long live the organization
for the organized 
join the organization 
the organization needs you 
  fight the good fight 
  you listen to him 
  you don t listen to me 
  sit down 
you gotta listen to him 
  long live the organization 
  sit down 
join the organization 
you gotta listen to him 
oh  starks   
   you are real stubborn 
but there s ways of fixing that 
the less you freak 
the less you ll trip out 
stay calm 
criminally insane 
gentlemen  i m gonna need you
to step out of the car   
   with your hands in the air  please 
  what seems to be the problem  officer 
problem is you re moving too slow  step out
of the car with your hands in the air 
can i open the door here 
hey  soldier boy  you awake 
didn t think so 
yeah 
it s okay  you re okay 
hey  jack  grab the ball 
show mom  honey 
will you give me one sec 
you got nerve showing up like this 
you mind 
okay  here goes 
jack starks died from a wound
to the head  january 1 st  1993 
how  i mean  how do i die 
it didn t say 
does that mean you believe me 
i don t know what i believe 
  what else you find out 
  whole bunch of stuff 
there was a doctor  becker 
he was using some kind of behavior
modification on his patients   
   that was banned in the  70s 
and there was another doctor too 
a dr  lorenson 
and something about a kid
she was treating  babak 
  don t know who that is 
  i don t know   
   but the whole thing
was a major scandal 
becker claimed he was trying to create
a womb like environment for his patients 
fucking womb 
it wasn t a fucking womb 
look  i have to find out how i die 
well  alpine grove still exists 
we could go see if there s anyone around
who might know what really happened 
we could 
thanks for doing this 
well  i must be the crazy one  right 
i m sorry i can t tell you more
about your uncle s death 
they used the hospital medical examiner   
   blunt trauma  doesn t tell me anything 
  i m sorry  that s all it says 
i mean  weren t there doctors 
what about dr  becker or dr  lorenson    
dr  lorenson is still here at the hospital 
she was here the same time as your uncle 
i m sure she could be
of more help to you 
  and what about becker and hopkins 
  dr  hopkins died 
and i m not familiar with a dr  becker 
well  can you see if there d be any kind
of forwarding address for dr  becker 
is there some particular reason
for these questions 
he s the only family i remember 
what does this guy keep smiling about 
hi  beth lorenson 
  how do you do 
  nice to meet you 
  hi  beth lorenson 
  jackie price 
sit down  sit down 
i m sorry  you look exactly like him 
did you know him well 
your uncle was my most
memorable patient 
  why is that 
  in the end   
   he made me change my mind
about a lot of things 
  he actually helped me with a case of mine 
  really  what case 
  i was working with a little boy 
  babak yazdi 
  yes 
  who was he 
a friend s son 
how do you know about him 
we saw it when we were looking up
information about his uncle 
how did he help 
well  it s complicated  but in the end
he let me know how   
   i could get through to him 
  how 
it s complicated 
and it was a really long time ago 
let me ask you something 
do you know how my uncle died 
yeah  i think it was from   
   a head trauma 
yes  but how  how did he get it 
i don t know 
you don t 
think dr  becker might have
a better idea 
yes  dr  becker would know more 
  i don t believe a word she just said 
  me neither 
come on  there s one last thing 
  to remind you of the staff softball game
at 4 p m   so don t be late 
jack  what is this 
this is the room 
they used to hang it over there 
i m actually in this drawer right now 
you know what 
maybe this wasn t such a good idea 
you folks ain t supposed
to be down here 
we were just leaving 
do i know you from somewhere 
i don t know  do you

  let s get him up  watch his head 
  the jacket 
what are you talking about 
he said we have to get him
into the jacket 
i know the procedure 
but we can t do this to him 
do whatever you did with becker 
i was 27 years old the first time i died 
i remember there was white everywhere 
there was war  and i felt alive 
but  really  i was dead 
sometimes i think
we live through things   
   only to be able to say that it happened 
that it wasn t to someone else 
it was to me 
sometimes we live to beat the odds 
i m not crazy   
   even though they thought i was 
i live in the same world as everyone else 
i just saw more of it 
as i m sure you have 
they ll find my body tomorrow 
you can check it out
if you don t believe me 
i ve seen life after my death   
   and i m telling you this
because it s the only way   
   to help you and your daughter
have a better life of your own 
jean   
   you re gonna pass out one day
smoking a cigarette   
   and burn to death 
your daughter grows up living
the same sad life you re living right now 
and she misses you so much 
sometimes life can only really begin
with the knowledge of death 
that it can all end 
even when you least want it to 
the important thing in life is to believe   
   that while you re alive 
it s never too late 
i promise you  jean 
no matter how bad things look   
   they look better awake
than they do asleep 
when you die  there s only one thing
you want to happen 
you wanna come back 
mommy  daddy  is it time to get up 
he can t find four of us here 
come on  go in the kitchen 
oh  boy 
  hey  you okay
