the harmony of all living things 
but our closest friends were humans 
then  as sometimes happens 
the balance of nature shifted 
and hexxus  the very spirit of destruction 
rose up from the bowels of the earth
and rained down his poison 
the forest was nearly destroyed 
many lives were lost and the humans
fled in fear  never to return 
most think they didn t survive 
it was only by calling up
the magical powers of nature
that i was able to trap hexxus inside
an enchanted tree and save ferngully 
which is why it is so important
for you to learn to use these powers 
i won t be around for ever and you have to   
crysta 
yes 
that is why it is so important
for you to learn the secrets of   
  crysta 
  magi  yes  the secrets 
i know  but  i mean  it s all right now 
that was so long ago and you trapped
him in that tree and everything  so   
i really have to go now 
but i ll see you later  ok  bye 
  hey 
  pips 
you re spending more time
with magi than you do with me 
well  what can i learn from you 
hey 
  when the sleepy planet comes alive
  and i wake up in the warm sunlight
  there s a simple harmony to life
  a magic thing
  then i walk among the flowers and trees
  it s a magic thing
  and i feel the earth beneath my feet
  it s a magic thing
  and i remember that the air we breathe
  is a magic thing
  everybody now
  life is a magic
  thing
  yeah  yeah

i don t know if it is or not  i m so confused 
magi 
magi 
oh  magi  i just saw the most
incredible thing above the canopy 
a whole other world  the sky went on
for ever  and way over in the distance 
as far as i could see 
there was this enormous rock 
  like a   
  mountain 
  that was mount warning 
  and next to it was a    a    i don t know 
it looked like a strange black cloud
rising out of the earth 
  smoke  i should think 
  what s smoke 
oh  there are many things in our world
you don t yet know about  crysta 
there are worlds within worlds  crysta 
everything in our world is connected
by the delicate strands of the web of life 
which is balanced between
forces of destruction
and the magic forces of creation 
help it grow 
why can t i do it 
everyone can call on
the magic powers of the web of life 
you have to find it in yourself 
i want to  magi  you know i do 
but i was thinking about that smoke 
do you think it could be    hexxus 
no  there s no force in nature
that could release him 
and there are no poisons here
on which he can feed 
hexxus is trapped  for all time 
  now  that s enough for today 
  but what could have caused the smoke 
  now  now  now  off with you 
  but  magi   
hexxus 
so what d the mag have to say  huh 
she said i should get serious 
about time 
and stop hanging around

  that life has passed you by
  your spirits might be sinking
  with hope in short supply

the darkness come creeping
  a dream worth keeping

father 
since the beginning of time  we have been
the guardians and the healers of the forest 
we have too long forgotten
the magic powers of nature 
the time has come to call on them again 
remember  all the magic of creation
exists within a single  tiny seed 
we must go to magi 
look for the hero inside yourself  crysta 
look to the good and loving
heart in you and all others 
forjust as every seed holds
the power and magic of creation 
so  too  do you and every
other creature in this world 
magi  don t leave me 
i love you  i ll always be with you 
we all have a power 
and it grows when it is shared
