in the american fashion 
i gave her freedom  but i taught her
never to dishonor her family 
she found a boyfriend  not an italian 
she went to the movies with him 
she stayed out late 
i didn t protest 
two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend 
they made her drink whiskey
and then they tried to
take advantage of her 
she resisted  she kept her honor 
so they beat her like an animal 
when i went to the hospital 
her nose was broken 
her jaw was shattered 
held together by wire 
she couldn t even weep
because of the pain 
but i wept  why did i weep 
she was the light of my life 
beautiful girl 
now she will never be beautiful again 
sorry 
i went to the police 
like a good american 
these two boys were brought to trial 
the judge sentenced them
to three years in prison 
but suspended the sentence 
suspended the sentence 
they went free that very day 
i stood in the courtroom like a fool 
those two bastards  they smiled at me 
then i said to my wife   for justice 
we must go to don corleone  
why did you go to the police 
why didn t you come to me first 
what do you want of me  tell me
anything  but do what i beg you to do 
what is that 
i want them dead 
that i cannot do 
i ll give you anything you ask 
i ve known you many years  but this
is the first time you ve asked for help 
i can t remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee 
even though my wife is godmother
to your only child 
but let s be frank here 
you never wanted my friendship 
and you were afraid to be in my debt 
i didn t want to get into trouble 
i understand 
you found paradise in america 
you made a good living  had police
protection and there were courts of law 
you didn t need a friend like me 
but now you come to me and say 
 don corleone  give me justice  
but you don t ask with respect 
you don t offer friendship  you don t
even think to call me godfather 
you come on my daughter s wedding
day and ask me to murder for money 
i ask you for justice 
that is not justice 
your daughter is alive 
let them suffer  then  as she suffers 
how much shall i pay you 
bonasera  bonasera 
what have i ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully 
if you d come in friendship 
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day 
and if an honest man like you should
make enemies  they d be my enemies 
and then they would fear you 
be my friend 
godfather 
good 
some day  and that day may never
come  i ll ask a service of you 
but until that day
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter s wedding day 
  gràzie  godfather 
  prego 
give this to clemenza 
i want people that aren t going to
get carried away 
we re not murderers 
in spite of what this undertaker says

he came all the way from california 
i told you he d come 
  he s probably in trouble again 
  he s a good godson 
johnny  johnny  sing a song 
you never said
you knew johnny fontane 
  sure  you want to meet him 
  great  sure 
  my father helped him with his career 
  he did 
how 
  let s listen to this song 
  michael   
please  michael  tell me 
when johnny was starting out  he was
signed to a personal service contract
with a big bandleader 
and as his career got better and better 
he wanted to get out of it 
johnny is my father s godson 
my father went to see this bandleader 
he offered him   10 000
to let johnny go 
but the bandleader said no 
so the next day my father went to see
him  but this time with luca brasi 
within an hour 
he signed a release
for a certified check of   1 000 
  how did he do that 
  made him an offer he couldn t refuse 
  what was that 
  luca brasi held a gun to his head 
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract 
that s a true story 
that s my family  kay  it s not me 
beautiful 
i ll take care of it 
tom   
i want you to find santino 
tell him to come to the office 
how are you  fredo 
my brother fredo  this is kay adams 
  hi 
  how are you doing 
  this is my brother mike 
  are you having a good time 
yeah  this is your friend 
i don t know what to do 
my voice is weak  it s weak 
anyway  if i had this part in the picture 
it puts me right back on top again 
but this    man won t give it to me 
the head of the studio 
  what s his name 
  woltz 
he won t give it to me 
and he says there s no chance 
sonny 
sonny 
sonny 
  sonny  are you in there 
  what 
the old man wants you 
one minute 
a month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book  a best seller 
the main character
is a guy just like me 
i wouldn t even have to act 
godfather  i don t know what to do 
you can act like a man 
what s the matter with you 
is this how you turned out  a hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman 
 what can i do  what can i do  
what is that nonsense 
ridiculous 
  you spend time with your family 
  sure i do 
good 
because a man who doesn t spend time
with his family can never be a real man 
you look terrible  i want you to eat 
rest  and in a month this hollywood
big shot will give you what you want 
it s too late 
they start shooting in a week 
i m going to make him an offer
he can t refuse 
just go outside and enjoy yourself 
and forget about all this nonsense 
  i want you to leave it all to me 
  all right 
  what time does my daughter leave 
  soon  after they cut the cake 
do we give your son in law
something important 
never  give him a living  but never
discuss the family business with him 
  what else 
  virgil sollozzo called 
  we ll have to see him next week 
  when you come back from california 
  when am i going to california 
  tonight 
i want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for johnny 
if there s nothing else  i d like to go
to my daughter s wedding 
carlo  we re going to take the picture 
wait a minute 
no  michael  not me 
okay  that s it  just like that  hold it 
  you need a little more heat on that arc 
  start talking 
i was sent by a friend
of johnny fontane 
this friend would give
his friendship to mr  woltz 
if mr  woltz would grant us a favor 
woltz is listening 
give johnny the part in that war film
you re starting next week 
and what favor would your friend
grant mr  woltz 
he could make your future union
problems disappear 
and one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin 
are you trying to muscle me 
listen  you son of a bitch 
let me lay it on the line 
johnny fontane
will never get that movie 
no matter how many dago guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork 
  i m german irish 
  listen here  my kraut mick friend 
  i m going to make trouble for you 
  i m a lawyer  i haven t threatened   
i know new york s big lawyers 
who are you 
i have a special practice 
i handle one client 
i ll wait for your call 
by the way 
i admire your pictures very much 
check him out 
  it s really beautiful 
  look at this 
  it used to decorate a king s palace 
  very nice 
why didn t you say
you work for corleone 
i thought you were some cheap hustler
johnny was running in 
  i only use his name when necessary 
  how s your drink 
  fine 
  now i ll show you something beautiful 
you do appreciate beauty  don t you 
there you are   600 000 on four hoofs 
i bet russian czars never paid
that for a single horse 
khartoum 
khartoum 
i m not going to race him  though 
i m going to put him out to stud 
thanks  tony 
let s get something to eat 
corleone is johnny s godfather 
to the italian people that s
a very sacred  close relationship 
i respect it 
tell him to ask me anything else 
this favor i can t give him 
he never asks a second favor
when he s been refused the first 
you don t understand 
johnny fontane never gets that movie 
that part is perfect for him 
it ll make him a big star 
i m going to run him out of the business 
and let me tell you why 
johnny fontane ruined one of woltz
international s most valuable protégés 
we trained her for five years 
singing  acting  dancing lessons 
i spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her  to make her a big star 
let me be even more frank 
to show you that i m not a hard hearted
man  that it s not all dollars and cents 
she was beautiful 
she was young and innocent 
she s the greatest piece of ass i ve had
and i ve had them all over the world 
then johnny fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and guinea charm 
and she runs off 
she threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous 
and a man in my position can t afford
to be made to look ridiculous 
you get the hell out of here 
if that goombah tries any rough stuff 
tell him i m no bandleader 
yeah  i heard that story 
thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening 
maybe your car can take me
to the airport 
mr  corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately 
  you re not too tired  are you  tom 
  no  i slept on the plane 
i have the sollozzo notes here 
now   
sollozzo is known as the turk 
he s supposed to be very good
with a knife 
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint 
his business is narcotics 
he has fields in turkey 
where they grow poppy 
in sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin 
he needs cash 
he needs protection from the police 
he ll give a piece of the action 
i don t know how much 
the tattaglia family is behind him here 
they have to be in it for something 
  what about his prison record 
  one term in italy  one here 
he s known as a top narcotics man 
  santino  what do you think 
  a lot of money in that white powder 
tom 
yes  there s more money in narcotics
than anything else 
if we don t get into it  somebody else
will  maybe the five families 
with that money they can buy
more police and political power 
then they come after us 
now we have unions and gambling  and
that s great  but narcotics is the future 
if we don t get a piece of that action 
we risk everything in 10 years  time 
so  what s your answer
going to be  pop 
don corleone 
i need a man who has powerful friends 
i need a million dollars in cash 
i need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket  like nickels and dimes 
  what is the interest for my family 
  30  
in the first year your end should be
three  four million dollars 
and then it would go up 
and what is the interest
for the tattaglia family 
my compliments 
i ll take care of them  out of my share 
so i receive 30  for finance 
political influence and legal protection 
that s right 
why do you come to me 
why do i deserve this generosity 
if you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance 
te salud  don corleone 
i said that i would see you  because
i heard you were a serious man 
to be treated with respect 
but  i must say no to you 
and i ll give you my reason 
it s true 
i have a lot of friends in politics 
they wouldn t be friendly long if i was
involved in drugs instead of gambling 
which they regard as a harmless vice 
but drugs is a dirty business 
it doesn t make any difference to me
what a man does for a living 
but your business is    a little dangerous 
if you re worried about security 
the tattaglias will guarantee it 
  the tattaglias would guarantee our   
  wait a minute 
i have a sentimental weakness
for my children  and i spoil them 
they talk when they should listen 
but anyway   
signor sollozzo  my no is final  i wish to
congratulate you on your new business 
i know you ll do well  and good luck 
especially since your interests
don t conflict with mine  thank you 
santino 
come here 
what s the matter with you 
your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl 
never tell anybody outside the family
what you re thinking again 
go on 
tom  what s this nonsense 
it s from johnny 
he s starring in that new film 
  take it away 
  take it over there 
and
tell luca brasi to come in 
i m a little worried
about this sollozzo fellow 
find out what he s got
under his fingernails 
go to the tattaglias 
make them think that you re not
too happy with our family
and find out what you can 
i got something for your mother

famous temper of yours  sonny 
i ll wait 
your boss is dead 
i know you re not in the muscle end
of the family  so don t be scared 
i want you to help the corleones
and me 
we got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up 
drink it 
it s up to you to make peace
between me and sonny 
sonny was hot for my deal  wasn t he 
and you knew
it was the right thing to do 
  sonny will come after you 
  that will be his first reaction  sure 
so you have to talk sense into him 
the tattaglia family is behind me 
the other new york families will go
along with anything to prevent war 
let s face it  with all due respect 
the don   rest in peace   was slipping 
ten years ago 
could i have gotten to him 
well  now he s dead  tom 
and nothing can bring him back 
you ve got to talk to sonny  to the
caporegimes  tessio  fat clemenza 
it s good business  tom 
i ll try  but even sonny won t be able
to call off luca brasi 
yeah  well   
let me worry about luca 
you just talk to sonny 
and the other two kids 
  i ll do my best 
  good 
now you can go 
i don t like violence  tom 
i m a businessman 
blood is a big expense 
he s still alive 
they hit him with five shots 
and he s still alive 
that s bad luck for me  and bad luck
for you if you don t make that deal 
your mother is at the hospital with your
father  looks like he ll pull through 
it s a lot of bad blood  sollozzo  philip
tattaglia  bruno tattaglia  ramon   
  you gonna kill all those guys 
  stay out of it 
if you get rid of sollozzo 
everything falls into line 
what about luca 
sollozzo thinks he can control him 
if luca sold out 
we re in a lot of trouble 
  has anyone been in touch with luca 
  we ve been trying all night 
  hey  do me a favor   
  luca never sleeps over with a broad 
well  tom  you re consigliere 
what do we do if the old man dies 
if we lose the old man  we lose the
political contacts and half our strength 
the other new york families might
support sollozzo to avoid a long war 
this is almost 1946 
nobody wants bloodshed anymore 
if your father dies
you make the deal 
  easy to say  he s not your father 
  i m as much a son as you or mike 
what is it 
  paulie  i told you to stay put 
  the guy at the gates has a package 
tessio  go see what it is 
  shall i stay 
  yeah  are you all right 
  i m fine 
  there s food  are you hungry 
  no 
  a drink  brandy will sweat it out 
  go ahead 
  that might be a good idea 
take care of that son of a bitch 
paulie sold out the old man 
  make that the first thing on your list 
  understood 
mickey  tomorrow  get some guys
and go to luca s apartment 
maybe we shouldn t get mike
mixed up in this too directly 
hanging around the house
on the phone would be a big help 
try luca again

what did he say    he wants us to send
michael to hear the proposition 
he promises that the deal
is too good to refuse 
  and bruno tattaglia 
  that s part of the deal 
  he cancels out what they did to father 
  we should listen to them 
no more  not this time  consigliere 
no more meetings  discussions 
or sollozzo tricks 
i want sollozzo  or we go to war   
  the other families   
  they hand me sollozzo 
this is business  not personal 
  they shot my father   
  even that was business  not personal 
then business will have to suffer 
do me a favor 
no more advice on how
to patch things up  just help me win 
i found out about captain mccluskey 
who broke mike s jaw 
he s definitely on sollozzo s payroll 
and for big money 
mccluskey has agreed
to be the turk s bodyguard 
so when sollozzo is being guarded 
he s invulnerable 
nobody has ever gunned down
a new york police captain 
all the families would come after you 
the corleone family would be outcasts 
even the old man s political protection
would run for cover 
do me a favor 
take this into consideration 
all right  we ll wait 
we can t wait  we can t wait 
no matter what sollozzo says 
he s going to kill pop 
that s the key for him 
we ve got to get sollozzo 
  mike is right 
  let me ask you something 
what about this mccluskey 
what do we do with this cop 
they want to have a meeting
with me  right 
it will be me  mccluskey and sollozzo 
let s set the meeting 
get our informers to find out
where it s going to be held 
we insist it s a public place 
a bar  a restaurant 
some place where there are people 
so i feel safe 
they ll search me
when i meet them  right 
so i can t have a weapon on me 
but if clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me
then i ll kill them both 
nice college boy  didn t want to
get mixed up in the family business 
now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you 
this isn t like the army  you have to get
close and get their brains on your suit 
you re taking this very personal 
tom  this is business
and he s taking it personal 
  where does it say you can t kill a cop 
  mikey   
i m talking about a cop who s mixed up
in drugs  a dishonest cop 
a cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming 
that s a terrific story  we have
newspaper people on the payroll  right 
  they might like a story like that 
  they might 
it s not personal  sonny 
it s strictly business 
it s as cold as they come 
impossible to trace 
so you don t worry about prints 
i put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt  try it 
is the trigger too tight 
my ears 
i left it noisy  so it scares away any
pain in the ass innocent bystanders 
you ve shot them both 
now what do you do 
  sit down  finish my dinner 
  don t fool around 
let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out 
everybody will still think you ve got it 
they ll stare at your face 
so walk out fast  but don t run 
don t look anybody in the eye 
but don t look away either 
they ll be scared stiff 
so don t worry about nothing 
you ll be all right  you ll take
a vacation  nobody knows where 
and we ll catch the hell 
  how bad do you think it will be 
  pretty goddamn bad 
all the other families will probably
line up against us 
these things have to happen every five 
10 years  gets rid of the bad blood 
been 10 years since the last one 
you have to stop them at the beginning 
like they should have stopped hitler in
munich  not letting him get away with it 
you know  mike  we were all proud
of you  being a hero and all 
your father too 
nothing  not a hint  absolutely nothing 
even sollozzo s people don t know
where the meeting will be held 
how much time do we have 
they re going to pick you up outside
jack dempsey s in an hour and a half 
  we could put a tail on them 
  sollozzo would lose our ass 
  what about the negotiator 
  he s playing pinochle with my men 
  he s happy  they re letting him win 
  too risky  maybe we should call it off 
the negotiator plays cards
until mike is back safe 
  he could blast whoever is in the car 
  they ll expect that 
sollozzo might not even be
in the car  sonny 
i ll get it 
louis  restaurant in the bronx 
  is it reliable 
  my man in mccluskey s precinct 
a police captain is on call 24 hours
a day  he ll be there between 8 and 10 
  anybody know this joint 
  sure  i do  it s perfect for us 
a small family place  good food 
everyone minds his business  perfect 
they ve got an old fashioned toilet 
you know  the box and the chain thing 
we might be able to
tape the gun behind it 
all right  mike  you go to the restaurant 
you eat  talk for a while  you relax 
make them relax 
then you go to take a leak  no 
better still  you ask permission to go 
then you come back blasting 
two shots in the head apiece 
i want somebody very good
to plant that gun 
i don t want him coming out
with just his dick 
  the gun will be there 
  you drive him and pick him up 
let s move 
did he tell you to drop the gun
right away 
yeah  a million times 
don t forget  two shots apiece
in the head as soon as you come out 
how long do you think it will be
before i can come back 
at least a year 
i ll square it with mom  that you re not
seeing her before you leave and   
i ll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right 
take care 
take care  mike 
i m glad you came  i hope
we can straighten everything out 
it s not the way i wanted things to go 
it should never have happened 
i want to straighten everything out 
i don t want my father bothered again 
i swear on my children
that he won t be  mike 
but you have to keep an open mind
when we talk 
i hope you re not a hothead like sonny 
you can t talk business with him 
he s a good kid 
i m sorry about the other night  mike 
i ve got to frisk you  so turn around 
on your knees  facing me 
i guess i m getting too old for my job 
too grouchy 
can t stand the aggravation 
you know how it is 
he s clean 
going to jersey 
maybe 
nice work  lou 
  how s the food in this restaurant 
  try the veal  it s the best in the city 
i ll have it 
  i m going to speak italian to mikey 
  go ahead 
what i want   
what s most important to me
is that i have a guarantee 
no more attempts on my father s life 
what guarantees can i give you 
i m the hunted one 
i missed my chance 
you think too much of me  kid 
i m not that clever 
all i want is a truce 
i have to go to the bathroom 
is it all right 
when you got to go  you got to go 
he s clean 
don t take too long 
i ve frisked a thousand punks 
okay  you take over 
i love you  grandpa 
i m sorry  pa  he doesn t know you yet 
  hey  big guy  give it to grandpa 
  okay 
 i hope you get well  grandpa  and wish
i see you soon  your grandson frank  
go with your mother 
take them downstairs 
go on  carlo  you too 
go on 
  what s the matter with you  carlo 
  shut up and set the table 
since mccluskey s killing  the police
have cracked down on our operations 
and also the other families 
there s been a lot of bad blood 
they hit us  so we hit them back 
through our newspaper contacts
we ve been able to put out material
about mccluskey s link with sollozzo
in the drug rackets 
so things are loosening up 
and i m sending fredo to las vegas 
under the protection
of don francesco of l a 
  i want him to rest 
  i m going to learn the casino business 
where s michael 
it was michael who killed sollozzo 
but he s safe  we re starting to work
to bring him back 
i want you to find out
where that old pimp tattaglia is hiding 
i want him now 
sonny  things are starting to loosen up 
if you go after tattaglia  all hell
will break loose  pop can negotiate 
  he must get better first  i ll decide   
  war is costly  we can t do business 
  neither can they  don t worry about it 
  we can t afford a stalemate 
  no more stalemate  i ll kill the bastard 
  you re getting a great reputation 
do as i say  if i had a sicilian wartime
consigliere  i wouldn t be in this shape 
pop had genco  look what i got 
i m sorry  i didn t mean that

fabrizio

no  apollonia 
don barzini  i want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting 
and the other heads of the five families
from new york and new jersey 
carmine cuneo from the bronx 
and from brooklyn
philip tattaglia 
and from staten island
we have with us victor strachi 
and the other associates that came as
far as from california and kansas city
and all the other territories
of the country  thank you 
how did things ever get so far 
i don t know 
it was so unfortunate  so unnecessary 
tattaglia lost a son  and i lost a son 
we re quits  and if tattaglia agrees 
then i m willing to let things go on
as before 
we re grateful to don corleone
for calling this meeting 
we all know him as a man of his word 
a modest man who listens to reason 
yes  don barzini  he s too modest 
he had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket 
he refused to share them 
when did i ever refuse
an accommodation 
all of you know me 
when did i ever refuse 
except one time  and why 
because i believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come 
it s not like gambling or liquor
or even women 
which is something that most people
want  but is forbidden by the church 
even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics 
i believed that then
and i believe that now 
times have changed 
it s not like the old days 
when we could do anything we wanted 
a refusal is not the act of a friend 
if don corleone had all the judges and
politicians  then he must share them
or let others use them  he must let us
draw the water from the well 
certainly he can present a bill
for such services 
after all  we re not communists 
i also don t believe in drugs 
for years i paid my people extra  so
they wouldn t do that kind of business 
somebody says to them
 i have powders  
 if you put up
3 4 000 dollar investment 
we can make 50 000 distributing  
they can t resist  i want to control it
as a business  keep it respectable 
i don t want it near schools 
i don t want it sold to children 
that s an infàmia 
in my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored 
they re animals 
so let them lose their souls 
i hoped that we could come here
and reason together 
and i m willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution 
we are agreed  the traffic in drugs
will be permitted  but controlled 
don corleone will give us protection
in the east  and there will be peace 
i must have strict assurance
from corleone 
as time goes by
and his position becomes stronger 
will he attempt any individual vendetta 
we are all reasonable men 
we don t have to give assurances 
you talk about vengeance 
will vengeance
bring your son back to you 
or my boy to me 
i forgo the vengeance of my son 
but i have selfish reasons 
my youngest son was forced
to leave this country
because of this sollozzo business 
and i have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely 
cleared of all these false charges 
but i m a superstitious man 
if an unlucky accident should befall him 
if he should be shot by a police officer 
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell 
or if he s struck by a bolt of lightning 
then i m going to blame
some of the people in this room 
and that i do not forgive 
but  that aside 
let me say that i swear
on the souls of my grandchildren 
that i will not be the one to break
the peace we ve made here today 
should i insist that all of tattaglia s
drug middlemen have clean records 
mention it  don t insist 
  barzini will know without being told 
  you mean tattaglia 
tattaglia s a pimp 
he could never have outfought santino 
but i didn t know until this day
that it was barzini all along 
come on  nancy 
keep together  everyone  brian 
okay  all right 
how long have you been back 
i ve been back a year 
longer than that  i think 
it s good to see you  kay 
i m working for my father now  kay 
he s been sick  very sick 
but you re not like him 
you told me you weren t going to
become like your father 
my father is no different
than any other powerful man 
any man who s responsible
for other people 
like a senator or president 
  how naive you sound 
  why 
they don t have men killed 
who s being naive  kay 
my father s way of doing things is over 
even he knows that 
in five years the corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate 
trust me  that s all i can tell you
about my business  kay   
michael  why did you come here  why 
what do you want with me after all
this time  i ve been calling and writing 
i came because i need you 
i care for you 
  please stop it  michael 
  because    i want you to marry me 
  it s too late 
  please  kay   
i ll do anything you ask
to make up for what s happened to us 
because that s important  kay 
because what s important is that
we have each other 
that we have a life together 
that we have children  our children 
kay  i need you 
and i love you 
barzini s people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it 
  soon i ll have no place to hang my hat 
  be patient 
i m not asking for help 
just take off the handcuffs 
  be patient 
  we must protect ourselves 
  let me recruit some new men 
  no 
  barzini would get an excuse to fight 
  mike  you re wrong 
don corleone   
you once said that one day tessio
and me could form our own family 
till today i would never think of it 
i must ask your permission 
michael is now head of the family 
if he gives his permission 
then you have my blessing 
after we make the move to nevada
you can leave the corleone family
and go on your own 
  how long will that be 
  six months 
forgive me  but with you gone 
me and pete
will come under barzini s thumb 
i hate that barzini  in six months  time
there will be nothing left to build on 
  do you have faith in my judgment 
  yes 
  do i have your loyalty 
  always  godfather 
then be a friend to michael 
do as he says 
things are negotiated that ll solve your
problems and answer your questions 
that s all i can tell you now 
carlo  you grew up in nevada 
when we make our move there 
you ll be my right hand man 
tom hagen is no longer consigliere 
he ll be our lawyer in vegas 
that s no reflection on tom 
just how i want it 
if i ever need help  who s a better
consigliere than my father  that s it 
  thank you  papa 
  i m happy for you  carlo 
mike    why am i out 
you re not a wartime consigliere  tom 
things may get rough with the move 
tom 
i advised michael  i never thought
you were a bad consigliere 
i thought santino was a bad don 
rest in peace 
michael has all my confidence 
just as you do 
but there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen 
  maybe i could help 
  you re out  tom 
i can t get over the way your face looks 
so good 
this doctor did some job 
did kay talk you into it  hey  hey  hey 
leave them out here 
he s tired and wants to clean up 
let me open the door  all right 
  hello  mike  welcome to las vegas 
  all for you  kid  it s all his idea 
  your brother freddy 
  girls 
i ll be right back  keep them occupied 
  anything you want  kid  anything 
  who are the girls 
  that s for you to find out 
  get rid of them  fredo 
  hey  mike   
  i m here on business  get rid of them 
i m tired  get rid of the band too 
hey  take off  take off  let s go 
hey  that s it  hey  angelo 
hey  come on  scram 
come on  honey  i don t know
what s the matter with him  johnny 
sorry 
i don t know  he s tired 
what happened to moe greene 
he had some business  he said to
give him a call when the party started 
well  give him a call 
  johnny  how are you 
  nice to see you  mike 
  we re proud of you 
  thanks 
sit down  i want to talk to you 
the don is proud too 
well  i owe it all to him 
he knows how grateful you are 
that s why
he d like to ask a favor of you 
mike  what can i do 
we re thinking of giving up our interests
in the olive oil business
and settling here 
moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel  so we ll own all of it 
  tom 
  are you sure 
moe loves the business 
he never said nothing about selling 
i ll make him an offer he can t refuse 
see  johnny   
we figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino 
we hope you ll sign a contract
to appear five times a year 
perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same 
we re counting on you 
sure  mike 
i ll do anything for my godfather 
good 
hey  mike  hello  fellows 
everybody s here  freddy  tom 
  good to see you 
  how are you  moe 
have everything  specially prepared
food  the best dancers  and good credit 
draw chips for everybody 
so they can play on the house 
is my credit good enough
to buy you out 
buy me out 
the casino  the hotel 
the corleone family
wants to buy you out 
the corleone family wants
to buy me out  no  i buy you out 
your casino loses money 
we can do better 
  you think i m skimming off the top 
  you re unlucky 
you guineas make me laugh 
i took freddy in when you had a bad
time  and now you try to push me out 
you did that
because we bankrolled your casino
and the molinari family guaranteed
his safety  let s talk business 
yes  first of all  you re all done 
you don t have
that kind of muscle anymore 
the godfather is sick  you re getting
chased out of new york by the others 
do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over 
i talked to barzini  i can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel 
is that why you slapped my brother
around in public 
that was nothing  mike 
moe didn t mean nothing by that 
he flies off the handle sometimes 
but we re good friends 
i have a business to run 
i ve got to kick asses sometimes 
we had an argument 
so i had to straighten him out 
you straightened my brother out 
he was banging cocktail waitresses 
players couldn t get a drink 
what s wrong with you 
i leave for new york tomorrow 
think about a price 
son of a bitch 
i m moe greene  i made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders 
wait a minute  moe  i have an idea 
tom  you re the consigliere 
talk to the don   
just a minute  don is semi retired and
mike is in charge of the family business 
if you have anything to say 
say it to michael 
mike  you don t come to las vegas and
talk to a man like moe greene like that 
fredo   
you re my older brother  and i love you 
but don t ever take sides with anyone
against the family again 
ever 
i have to see my father and his people 
so have dinner without me 
this weekend we ll go out  we ll go to
