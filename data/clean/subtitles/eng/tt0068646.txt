in the american fashion
i gave her freedom but i taught her
never to dishonor her family
she found a boyfriend not an italian
she went to the movies with him
she stayed out late
i didnt protest
two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend
they made her drink whiskey
and then they tried to
take advantage of her
she resisted she kept her honor
so they beat her like an animal
when i went to the hospital
her nose was broken
her jaw was shattered
held together by wire
she couldnt even weep
because of the pain
but i wept why did i weep
she was the light of my life
beautiful girl
now she will never be beautiful again
sorry
i went to the police
like a good american
these two boys were brought to trial
the judge sentenced them
to three years in prison
but suspended the sentence
suspended the sentence
they went free that very day
i stood in the courtroom like a fool
those two bastards they smiled at me
then i said to my wife for justice
we must go to don corleone
why did you go to the police
why didnt you come to me first
what do you want of me tell me
anything but do what i beg you to do
what is that
i want them dead
that i cannot do
ill give you anything you ask
ive known you many years but this
is the first time youve asked for help
i cant remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee
even though my wife is godmother
to your only child
but lets be frank here
you never wanted my friendship
and you were afraid to be in my debt
i didnt want to get into trouble
i understand
you found paradise in america
you made a good living had police
protection and there were courts of law
you didnt need a friend like me
but now you come to me and say
don corleone give me justice
but you dont ask with respect
you dont offer friendship you dont
even think to call me godfather
you come on my daughters wedding
day and ask me to murder for money
i ask you for justice
that is not justice
your daughter is alive
let them suffer then as she suffers
how much shall i pay you
bonasera bonasera
what have i ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully
if youd come in friendship
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day
and if an honest man like you should
make enemies theyd be my enemies
and then they would fear you
be my friend
godfather
good
some day and that day may never
come ill ask a service of you
but until that day
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughters wedding day
gràzie godfather
prego

get carried away

michael
please michael tell me
when johnny was starting out he was
signed to a personal service contract
with a big bandleader
and as his career got better and better
he wanted to get out of it
johnny is my fathers godson
my father went to see this bandleader
he offered him  10000
to let johnny go
but the bandleader said no
so the next day my father went to see
him but this time with luca brasi
within an hour
he signed a release
for a certified check of  1000
how did he do that
made him an offer he couldnt refuse
what was that
luca brasi held a gun to his head
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract
thats a true story
thats my family kay its not me
beautiful
ill take care of it
tom
i want you to find santino

to this book a bestseller
the main character

whats the matter with you
is this how you turned out a hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman
what can i do what can i do

good
because a man who doesnt spend time
with his family can never be a real man
you look terrible i want you to eat
rest and in a month this hollywood
big shot will give you what you want
its too late
they start shooting in a week
im going to make him an offer
he cant refuse
just go outside and enjoy yourself
and forget about all this nonsense
i want you to leave it all to me
all right
what time does my daughter leave
soon after they cut the cake
do we give your soninlaw
something important
never give him a living but never
discuss the family business with him
what else
virgil sollozzo called
well have to see him next week
when you come back from california
when am i going to california
tonight
i want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for johnny
if theres nothing else id like to go
to my daughters wedding
carlo were going to take the picture
wait a minute
no michael not me
okay thats it just like that hold it
you need a little more heat on that arc
start talking
i was sent by a friend
of johnny fontane
this friend would give
his friendship to mr woltz
if mr woltz would grant us a favor
woltz is listening
give johnny the part in that war film
youre starting next week
and what favor would your friend
grant mr woltz
he could make your future union
problems disappear
and one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin
are you trying to muscle me
listen you sonofabitch
let me lay it on the line
johnny fontane
will never get that movie
no matter how many dago guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork
im germanirish
listen here my krautmick friend
im going to make trouble for you
im a lawyer i havent threatened
i know new yorks big lawyers
who are you
i have a special practice
i handle one client
ill wait for your call
by the way
i admire your pictures very much
check him out
its really beautiful
look at this
it used to decorate a kings palace
very nice
why didnt you say
you work for corleone
i thought you were some cheap hustler
johnny was running in
i only use his name when necessary
hows your drink
fine
now ill show you something beautiful
you do appreciate beauty dont you
there you are 600000 on four hoofs
i bet russian czars never paid
that for a single horse
khartoum
khartoum
im not going to race him though
im going to put him out to stud
thanks tony
lets get something to eat
corleone is johnnys godfather
to the italian people thats
a very sacred close relationship
i respect it
tell him to ask me anything else
this favor i cant give him
he never asks a second favor
when hes been refused the first
you dont understand
johnny fontane never gets that movie
that part is perfect for him
itll make him a big star
im going to run him out of the business
and let me tell you why
johnny fontane ruined one of woltz
internationals most valuable protégés
we trained her for five years
singing acting dancing lessons
i spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her to make her a big star
let me be even more frank
to show you that im not a hardhearted
man that its not all dollars and cents
she was beautiful
she was young and innocent
shes the greatest piece of ass ive had
and ive had them all over the world
then johnny fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and guinea charm
and she runs off
she threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous
and a man in my position cant afford
to be made to look ridiculous
you get the hell out of here
if that goombah tries any rough stuff
tell him im no bandleader
yeah i heard that story
thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening
maybe your car can take me
to the airport
mr corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately
youre not too tired are you tom
no i slept on the plane
i have the sollozzo notes here
now
sollozzo is known as the turk
hes supposed to be very good
with a knife
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint
his business is narcotics
he has fields in turkey
where they grow poppy
in sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin
he needs cash
he needs protection from the police
hell give a piece of the action
i dont know how much
the tattaglia family is behind him here
they have to be in it for something
what about his prison record
one term in italy one here
hes known as a top narcotics man
santino what do you think
a lot of money in that white powder
tom
yes theres more money in narcotics
than anything else
if we dont get into it somebody else
will maybe the five families
with that money they can buy
more police and political power
then they come after us
now we have unions and gambling and
thats great but narcotics is the future
if we dont get a piece of that action
we risk everything in 10 years time
so whats your answer
going to be pop
don corleone
i need a man who has powerful friends
i need a million dollars in cash
i need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket like nickels and dimes
what is the interest for my family
30
in the first year your end should be
three four million dollars
and then it would go up
and what is the interest
for the tattaglia family
my compliments
ill take care of them out of my share
so i receive 30 for finance
political influence and legal protection
thats right
why do you come to me
why do i deserve this generosity
if you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance
te salud don corleone
i said that i would see you because
i heard you were a serious man
to be treated with respect
but i must say no to you
and ill give you my reason
its true
i have a lot of friends in politics
they wouldnt be friendly long if i was
involved in drugs instead of gambling
which they regard as a harmless vice
but drugs is a dirty business
it doesnt make any difference to me
what a man does for a living
but your business is a little dangerous
if youre worried about security
the tattaglias will guarantee it
the tattaglias would guarantee our
wait a minute
i have a sentimental weakness
for my children and i spoil them
they talk when they should listen
but anyway
signor sollozzo my no is final i wish to
congratulate you on your new business
i know youll do well and good luck
especially since your interests
dont conflict with mine thank you
santino
come here
whats the matter with you
your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl
never tell anybody outside the family
what youre thinking again
go on
tom whats this nonsense
its from johnny
hes starring in that new film
take it away
take it over there
and
tell luca brasi to come in
im a little worried
about this sollozzo fellow

famous temper of yours sonny

of the family so dont be scared
i want you to help the corleones
and me
we got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up
drink it
its up to you to make peace
between me and sonny
sonny was hot for my deal wasnt he
and you knew
it was the right thing to do
sonny will come after you
that will be his first reaction sure
so you have to talk sense into him
the tattaglia family is behind me
the other new york families will go
along with anything to prevent war
lets face it with all due respect
the don  rest in peace  was slipping
ten years ago
could i have gotten to him
well now hes dead tom
and nothing can bring him back
youve got to talk to sonny to the
caporegimes tessio fat clemenza
its good business tom
ill try but even sonny wont be able
to call off luca brasi
yeah well
let me worry about luca
you just talk to sonny
and the other two kids
ill do my best
good
now you can go
i dont like violence tom
im a businessman
blood is a big expense
hes still alive
they hit him with five shots
and hes still alive
thats bad luck for me and bad luck
for you if you dont make that deal
your mother is at the hospital with your
father looks like hell pull through
its a lot of bad blood sollozzo philip
tattaglia bruno tattaglia ramon
you gonna kill all those guys
stay out of it
if you get rid of sollozzo
everything falls into line
what about luca
sollozzo thinks he can control him
if luca sold out
were in a lot of trouble
has anyone been in touch with luca
weve been trying all night
hey do me a favor
luca never sleeps over with a broad
well tom youre consigliere
what do we do if the old man dies
if we lose the old man we lose the
political contacts and half our strength
the other new york families might
support sollozzo to avoid a long war
this is almost 1946
nobody wants bloodshed anymore
if your father dies
you make the deal
easy to say hes not your father
im as much a son as you or mike
what is it
paulie i told you to stay put
the guy at the gates has a package
tessio go see what it is
shall i stay
yeah are you all right
im fine
theres food are you hungry
no
a drink brandy will sweat it out
go ahead
that might be a good idea
take care of that sonofabitch
paulie sold out the old man
make that the first thing on your list
understood
mickey tomorrow get some guys
and go to lucas apartment
maybe we shouldnt get mike
mixed up in this too directly
hanging around the house
on the phone would be a big help
try luca again
whats this
a sicilian message
it means luca brasi
sleeps with the fishes
im going
when will you be home
probably late
dont forget the cannoli
yeah yeah yeah
rocco sit on the other side
you block the rearview mirror
sonnys running wild he wants
to go to mattresses already
we have to find a spot on the
west side try 309 west 43rd street

ill think about it
think while youre driving
i want to hit new york this month
watch the kids
paulie go down 39th street pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill
yeah all right
make sure theyre clean because
the guys will be there a long time

put your hand in your pocket
like you have a gun youll be all right
you did good
i thought all you guinea hoods
were locked up
why isnt anyone guarding my father
you little punk
dont you tell me my business
i pulled them off
stay away from this hospital
not until my fathers room is guarded
phil take him in
the kids clean captain
hes a war hero hes never been
i said take him in
whats the turk paying you
take a hold of him stand him up
stand him up straight
im the corleones attorney these men
are hired to protect vito corleone
theyre licensed to carry firearms
if you interfere youll have to appear
before the judge and show cause
let him go
whats with all the new faces
well need them now
after the hospital thing sonny got mad
we hit bruno tattaglia this morning
jesus christ
looks like a fortress around here
tamaduch hey 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day
that turk shows one hair on his ass
hes dead
mike let me look at you
youre beautiful beautiful
youre gorgeous
the turk wants to talk
imagine the nerve of the sonofabitch
he wants a meeting today
what did he say
what did he say he wants us to send
michael to hear the proposition
he promises that the deal
is too good to refuse
and bruno tattaglia
thats part of the deal
he cancels out what they did to father
we should listen to them
no more not this time consigliere
no more meetings discussions
or sollozzo tricks
i want sollozzo or we go to war
the other families
they hand me sollozzo
this is business not personal
they shot my father
even that was business not personal
then business will have to suffer
do me a favor
no more advice on how
to patch things up just help me win
i found out about captain mccluskey
who broke mikes jaw
hes definitely on sollozzos payroll
and for big money
mccluskey has agreed
to be the turks bodyguard
so when sollozzo is being guarded
hes invulnerable
nobody has ever gunned down
a new york police captain
all the families would come after you
the corleone family would be outcasts
even the old mans political protection
would run for cover
do me a favor
take this into consideration
all right well wait
we cant wait we cant wait
no matter what sollozzo says
hes going to kill pop
thats the key for him
weve got to get sollozzo
mike is right
let me ask you something
what about this mccluskey
what do we do with this cop
they want to have a meeting
with me right
it will be me mccluskey and sollozzo
lets set the meeting
get our informers to find out
where its going to be held
we insist its a public place
a bar a restaurant
some place where there are people
so i feel safe
theyll search me
when i meet them right
so i cant have a weapon on me
but if clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me
then ill kill them both
nice college boy didnt want to
get mixed up in the family business
now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you
this isnt like the army you have to get
close and get their brains on your suit
youre taking this very personal
tom this is business
and hes taking it personal
where does it say you cant kill a cop
mikey
im talking about a cop whos mixed up
in drugs a dishonest cop
a cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming
thats a terrific story we have
newspaper people on the payroll right
they might like a story like that
they might
its not personal sonny
its strictly business
its as cold as they come
impossible to trace
so you dont worry about prints
i put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt try it
is the trigger too tight
my ears
i left it noisy so it scares away any
painintheass innocent bystanders
youve shot them both
now what do you do
sit down finish my dinner
dont fool around
let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out
everybody will still think youve got it
theyll stare at your face
so walk out fast but dont run
dont look anybody in the eye
but dont look away either
theyll be scared stiff
so dont worry about nothing
youll be all right youll take
a vacation nobody knows where
and well catch the hell
how bad do you think it will be
pretty goddamn bad
all the other families will probably
line up against us
these things have to happen every five
10 years gets rid of the bad blood
been 10 years since the last one
you have to stop them at the beginning
like they should have stopped hitler in
munich not letting him get away with it
you know mike we were all proud
of you being a hero and all
your father too
nothing not a hint absolutely nothing
even sollozzos people dont know
where the meeting will be held
how much time do we have
theyre going to pick you up outside
jack dempseys in an hour and a half
we could put a tail on them
sollozzo would lose our ass
what about the negotiator
hes playing pinochle with my men
hes happy theyre letting him win
too risky maybe we should call it off
the negotiator plays cards
until mike is back safe
he could blast whoever is in the car
theyll expect that
sollozzo might not even be
in the car sonny
ill get it
louis restaurant in the bronx
is it reliable
my man in mccluskeys precinct
a police captain is on call 24 hours
a day hell be there between 8 and 10
anybody know this joint
sure i do its perfect for us
a small family place good food
everyone minds his business perfect
theyve got an oldfashioned toilet
you know the box and the chain thing
we might be able to
tape the gun behind it
all right mike you go to the restaurant
you eat talk for a while you relax
make them relax
then you go to take a leak no
better still you ask permission to go
then you come back blasting
two shots in the head apiece
i want somebody very good
to plant that gun
i dont want him coming out
with just his dick
the gun will be there
you drive him and pick him up
lets move
did he tell you to drop the gun
right away
yeah a million times
dont forget two shots apiece
in the head as soon as you come out
how long do you think it will be
before i can come back
at least a year
ill square it with mom that youre not
seeing her before you leave and
ill get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right
take care
take care mike
im glad you came i hope
we can straighten everything out
its not the way i wanted things to go
it should never have happened
i want to straighten everything out
i dont want my father bothered again

fabrizio

wait there ill drive to you
no apollonia
don barzini i want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting
and the other heads of the five families
from new york and new jersey
carmine cuneo from the bronx
and from brooklyn
philip tattaglia
and from staten island
we have with us victor strachi
and the other associates that came as
far as from california and kansas city
and all the other territories
of the country thank you
how did things ever get so far
i dont know
it was so unfortunate so unnecessary
tattaglia lost a son and i lost a son
were quits and if tattaglia agrees
then im willing to let things go on
as before
were grateful to don corleone
for calling this meeting
we all know him as a man of his word
a modest man who listens to reason
yes don barzini hes too modest
he had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket
he refused to share them
when did i ever refuse
an accommodation
all of you know me
when did i ever refuse
except one time and why
because i believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come
its not like gambling or liquor
or even women
which is something that most people
want but is forbidden by the church
even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics
i believed that then
and i believe that now
times have changed
its not like the old days
when we could do anything we wanted
a refusal is not the act of a friend
if don corleone had all the judges and
politicians then he must share them
or let others use them he must let us
draw the water from the well
certainly he can present a bill
for such services
after all were not communists
i also dont believe in drugs
for years i paid my people extra so
they wouldnt do that kind of business
somebody says to them
i have powders
if you put up
34000 dollar investment
we can make 50000 distributing
they cant resist i want to control it
as a business keep it respectable
i dont want it near schools
i dont want it sold to children
thats an infàmia
in my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored
theyre animals
so let them lose their souls
i hoped that we could come here
and reason together
and im willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution
we are agreed the traffic in drugs
will be permitted but controlled
don corleone will give us protection
in the east and there will be peace
i must have strict assurance
from corleone
as time goes by
and his position becomes stronger
will he attempt any individual vendetta
we are all reasonable men
we dont have to give assurances
you talk about vengeance
will vengeance
bring your son back to you
or my boy to me
i forgo the vengeance of my son
but i have selfish reasons
my youngest son was forced
to leave this country
because of this sollozzo business
and i have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely
cleared of all these false charges
but im a superstitious man
if an unlucky accident should befall him
if he should be shot by a police officer
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell
or if hes struck by a bolt of lightning
then im going to blame
some of the people in this room
and that i do not forgive
but that aside
let me say that i swear
on the souls of my grandchildren
that i will not be the one to break
the peace weve made here today
should i insist that all of tattaglias
drug middlemen have clean records
mention it dont insist
barzini will know without being told
you mean tattaglia
tattaglias a pimp
he could never have outfought santino
but i didnt know until this day
that it was barzini all along
come on nancy
keep together everyone brian
okay all right
how long have you been back
ive been back a year
longer than that i think
its good to see you kay
im working for my father now kay
hes been sick very sick
but youre not like him
you told me you werent going to
become like your father
my father is no different
than any other powerful man
any man whos responsible
for other people
like a senator or president
how naive you sound
why
they dont have men killed
whos being naive kay
my fathers way of doing things is over
even he knows that
in five years the corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate
trust me thats all i can tell you
about my business kay
michael why did you come here why
what do you want with me after all
this time ive been calling and writing
i came because i need you
i care for you
please stop it michael
because i want you to marry me
its too late
please kay
ill do anything you ask
to make up for whats happened to us
because thats important kay
because whats important is that
we have each other
that we have a life together
that we have children our children
kay i need you
and i love you
barzinis people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it
soon ill have no place to hang my hat
be patient
im not asking for help
just take off the handcuffs
be patient
we must protect ourselves
let me recruit some new men
no
barzini would get an excuse to fight
mike youre wrong
don corleone
you once said that one day tessio
and me could form our own family
till today i would never think of it
i must ask your permission
michael is now head of the family
if he gives his permission
then you have my blessing
after we make the move to nevada
you can leave the corleone family
and go on your own
how long will that be
six months
forgive me but with you gone
me and pete
will come under barzinis thumb
i hate that barzini in six months time
there will be nothing left to build on
do you have faith in my judgment
yes
do i have your loyalty
always godfather
then be a friend to michael
do as he says
things are negotiated thatll solve your
problems and answer your questions
thats all i can tell you now
carlo you grew up in nevada
when we make our move there
youll be my righthand man
tom hagen is no longer consigliere
hell be our lawyer in vegas
thats no reflection on tom
just how i want it
if i ever need help whos a better
consigliere than my father thats it
thank you papa
im happy for you carlo
mike why am i out
youre not a wartime consigliere tom
things may get rough with the move
tom
i advised michael i never thought
you were a bad consigliere
i thought santino was a bad don
rest in peace
michael has all my confidence
just as you do
but there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen
maybe i could help
youre out tom
i cant get over the way your face looks
so good
this doctor did some job
did kay talk you into it hey hey hey

tom

moe loves the business
he never said nothing about selling
ill make him an offer he cant refuse

that kind of muscle anymore
the godfather is sick youre getting
chased out of new york by the others
