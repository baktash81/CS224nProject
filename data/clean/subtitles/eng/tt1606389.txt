anything for love

but i wont do that
oh no i wont
im married to a cheeser
please stop
you love it
say you love it
stop ow
stop it
you love that song
oh leo
hey i have this theory
mmmhmm
that a girls guaranteed
to get preggers
if she does it in a car
what
mmmhmm
i have a theory too
my theory is about moments
moments of impact
my theory is that
these moments of impact
these flashes
of high intensity
that completely turn
our lives upside down
actually end up
defining who we are
thanks
next in line
one of my absolute
favorite moments
oh
you forgot your permit
yeah well i just sort of
come here to enjoy
the twohour line
the permits
sort of a bonus
the art institute
you work there
no im a student
im paige
im sorry im leo
well thank you
for this leo
you know what
i noticed in a totally
nonthreatening way
we have the same rpp zone
is that right
yup
hmm
you have impressive
powers of observation
yes
whats an rpp zone
residential
permit parking zone
oh
that sounds intimate
yeah
okay
what i was thinking
is that
i think we owe it
to ourselves really
to maybe get a drink
out of respect for our
zone compatibility and all
okay
okay
mmmhmm
all right okay
after you
pick a hand
pick a hand
pick a hand
that one
here we go
mmm
mmm
this is good
of the waters waves
still i know youre
in the darkness shining
when the sun
starts coming through
or when the cardinal
chides the moon
let me know if you
need anything else
i believe in energies
that no one has to see
for us to prove
i believe in you and me
and everything
well ever see and do
oh
oh
mmm
specks of gold
in the river running
from the deep moonlight
when the sun
starts coming through
or when the cardinal
chides the moon
that no one has to see
for us to prove
the rain pours down
in a million rivers
did you just fart
no
oh
maybe a little
that is so twisted
but totally romantic
god im so in love
with you its insane
as you know
your wifes ctscan
showed
intracranial hemorrhaging
we purposely keep patients
with traumatic brain injuries
in a comatose state
in order to calm
their systems
and allow the brain time
to heal itself while
the swelling subsides
and then we slowly
wean them off it now
the thing is
each one of us is
the sum total of
every moment that
weve ever experienced
with all the people
weve ever known
and its these moments
that become our history
like our own
personal greatest hits
of memories that we play
and replay in our minds
over and over again
arent you hungry
hey
hi
what you doing
nothing
really
no
whats that
nothing
oh nothing
foods ready
look if you keep
feeding that fleabag
its gonna
keep coming back
and im allergic
like you claim to be
allergic to cilantro
i cant stand cilantro
exactly
but youre not allergic
does anybody want
strawberries i bought
at the farmers market
buying groceries
bad sign
what
and we all know
what that means
i like her
shes like our mascot
thanks i think
i would rather have her
than that ferret you
tried to make us adopt
and she
makes great coffee
lets keep her
thank you
have some
thank you
movie i think you
spelled movie wrong
no
told you
yes
mmmhmm
i vow to help you love life
to always hold you
with tenderness
and to have the patience
that love demands
to speak when
words are needed
and to share the silence
when theyre not
to agree to disagree
on red velvet cake
and to live within
the warmth of your heart
and always call it home
wow you set the bar
kind of high
did you write
your vows on a menu
yeah why
i vow to fiercely love you
in all your forms
now and forever
i promise to never forget
that this is
a onceinalifetime love
and to always know
in the deepest part
of my soul
that no matter
what challenges
might carry us apart
that well always
find the way back
to each other
do you take each other
as spouses forever
i do
i do
then by the power
vested in me by
the state of illinois i
security
i now pronounce
you man and wife
and best friends for life
kiss run
you had to run
for the weekend
and you had
nowhere to be
you had enough
of the sorrow
and it was all on tv
you blew a kiss
to a goodbye and
thats how you met me
oh its ours
oh its ours
oh its ours
oh its ours
i have one piece
one piece
its
its not happening
i dont
oh my god
youre gonna be fine
oh my god im gonna
have to call them
im gonna have to call them
and tell them
that i cant do it
come to bed with me
come on
i know you wanna
come to bed with me
dont
oh no please no
stop it
okay okay okay
i think this ones
coming along fine
i mean
i know its not finished
but im already starting
to see a mood
its got like
a darkening curtain thing
happening there
and then a competing
light element there
mmmhmm
its abstract but
i mean i dont know
i kind of think
its already powerful
what
you totally love me
yeah i do
yeah
i know because
this is my piece
and thats the scrap pile
which im now saving
hmm
a moment of
total physical mental
and every other kind of love
dont crowd her
shes gonna be
a little groggy
so lets just
give her some space
hey
its so good to see you
paige
its okay
youre in the hospital
you were in a car accident
you hit your head
but youre okay
we just kept you asleep
for a little while
how do you feel
my head hurts
yeah well
thats perfectly normal
ill get you
something for that
was anyone else hurt
doctor
uh
paige
you know who i am right
yeah youre my doctor
um
im your husband
paige
mr collins
you said things
were very good
a brain injury isnt
like a broken bone
or a laceration
brains are
much less predictable
sometimes due to the way
the swelling tissue
presses against the skull
it can cause
some impairment
some impairment
she doesnt remember me
even though shes awake
the swelling
can cause confusion
or memory loss
erratic mood swings
what
but thats normal
so thats my theory
that these moments of impact
define who we are
but what i never considered
was what if one day
you could no longer
remember any of them
hi
what are you up to
sleeping
right
i brought you some clothes
thank you
im kind of hungry
okay
come on
so i just wanted to
verify a few things
with you about me
about us
great
so were married
yes
yeah
and i have weird hair
i think thats
taking a narrow view
you said it takes
too long to straighten
and youd rather
use that time to
work in your studio
my studio
why do i have a studio
youre an artist
sculptor
a really good one
right now youre
working on four pieces
for the tribune tower lobby
which is huge
everyone in town
wanted that commission
but your show at
the mcas 12 x 12
was amazing
so you won it
what about my law degree
i dont have a law degree
i think you were
a few credits shy
last time i wanted
to be an artist
i was in high school
i think you need to
look at it like a win
traumatic brain injury
is a win
youre an idiot
if she doesnt
remember who you are
then she doesnt remember
all the stupid shit
you ever did
you can start over
wipe the slate clean
im just worried if
she doesnt remember you
hows she going to
remember shes in love
with you what
i was frankly
a little stunned
she went for you
the first time
if anything youve
become less attractive
you guys are
a great support system
seriously though
what if she doesnt
remember me
then what
shes gonna remember you
shes gonna
remember all of us
were her family
yeah youre right
excuse me im looking
for my wife paige collins
she was right
over here yesterday
well it looks like
they moved her up
to the vip floor
that sounds expensive
its a donors wing
just go down here
and take the elevator
to the second floor
and make a right
okay thanks
paige your longterm
memory recall is intact
and im very optimistic
the rest of your memory is
going to improve with time
mr collins
im so glad youre here
this is bizarre
im leo paiges husband
do you know
how disconcerting it was
to hear secondhand
that my daughter had been
in the icu for weeks
and we hadnt been told
you should have
called us
im sorry
youve never
met my parents
i dont understand
why havent you met him
so doctor
now what is
the next step
the sooner
she settles back
into her life
her normal routine
the better
starting in a week or so
im gonna recommend
that paige see
a neural psychologist
okay
whatever she needs
therapy specialists
ill make sure
she gets the best
youll come home
where i can
take care of you
mom can make up
your old room
and i can take
some time off work
i dont mean to
be disrespectful
cause we really
appreciate that
but you just heard
paiges doctor say
that she needs to go back
to her normal routine
her life with me is
her normal routine
yes but thats a life
she doesnt remember
she will
thats what her doctor
just got through saying
no what she said was that
maybe paige will remember
now why not
let her come home
and recover with
people that she knows
and loves
were only trying to
do the best for paige
thats interesting
cause you havent
even asked her once
well no but
what i really need
is for everyone
to just stop bickering
listen none of this needs
to be decided right now
no sorry
i think you should all
head home get some rest
im sure everyone
could use it
how is it that
youre my husband
and youve
never met my family
you havent spoken
to them in years
why would i ever stop
speaking to my family
it all went down
before we met
and we never talked about it
no we did
so
for starters you wanted
to move into the city
and go to the art institute
and your father insisted
that you stay in law school
he had some
pretty strict views
on what you ought
to be doing
things just
spiraled from there
okay look
what i remember is
being in law school
and being engaged to jeremy
i i dont know
paige
okay babe babe
just just
the best thing to do
at this point
is to go back
to your life with me
you heard what
the doctor said
its the best thing
for your recovery
okay but i dont know you
and im just supposed
to get in your car
and go and live
at your place
its our place
without any proof of us
even being in love
other than our marriage
people get married for all
kinds of different reasons
okay like
like for a green card
im from cincinnati
did i keep a journal
no not that i know of
i guess this is
all he could find
oh well
it looks fine honey
i mean
were just going home so
its horrible
paige
i understand youre
finally leaving us
oh yes thats
what they tell me
so no driving until
i give you the sayso
but other than that
im gonna see you
in four to six weeks
all right
thank you so much
thank you doctor
for everything
thank you doctor
okay
you ready lets go
wait hold on
i got a voicemail
its from
before the accident
you said
you wanted evidence
okay yeah
well lets have a listen
hey baby
ugh im sorry
im still at my studio
i miss you so bad
my sculptures are starting
to look like you
so what are
you doing later
i kind of need some leo time
if you know what i mean
yeah anyway call me back
love you
i dont know i guess
in listening back to it
it doesnt
exactly prove anything
no no its
its cute
i mean i sound happy
okay look
think about it
you quit law school
you broke off your engagement
and you moved
into the city
those were all
choices that you made
way before
you even met me
i think that
you owe it to yourself
to honor those decisions
at least for right now
this is a mistake paige
i promise that
i will take care of her
please come home with me
come home with me
well figure
this out together
i guess i could
just try it out
to see if it would
help my memory and
mmmhmm
i could always come home
if i change my mind
i married him it must
have been for some reason
a guarded endorsement
but i will take it
i look like a freak
i think you look great
where do we live
on the north side
whos the president
of the country
yeah
obama
the senator
yeah you voted for him
i did
welcome home
after you

filet mignon

paige honey
welcome home
to family
to family
so leo
what about your family

no
oh thats a shame
both my parents are dead
its just paige

and what kind of
work do you do leo
i just opened up my own
recording studio downtown
paige actually convinced me
to turn it into a business
i did
yeah
isnt that sort
of a dying field
no i just mean
cant people record things
on their computers at home
and they sound just as good
ryan
what
look the records
that i like
they have life
and warmth and soul
like the slapback
on scotty moores guitar
on mystery train
look
youre not gonna get that
in your computer
youre gonna want
a live room youre gonna
want to bounce to tape
youre gonna want
real musicians in a room
vibing off of each other
you
i guess
to answer your question
it may be a dying field
and you can record
highquality stuff at home
but i mean come on
you cant get
the sun sessions
on your laptop
wow
wow
wow
wow
i heard everyone is
gonna be here tonight
this kind of thing
might be a little
too much for paige

for the christmas dance
we were
curling your hair
we ended up
burning off half your hair
i totally remember that
and didnt i wind up
having to wear a beret
to the dance
no no no
that was the
it was like she was
some sweaterset wearing
mojitodrinking
sorority girl
like a stepford wife
yeah basically
she was even
flirting with jeremy
right in front of me
exfiancé jeremy
no no no
in her mind
its current fiancé jeremy
which is why
it was probably
pretty annoying
to have her stranger husband
cockblock her all night
that is a lot to
get my mind around
so what turns her on
paige
no her mother
yes paige
like in bed
oh my god leo

a betweenmeandher
kind of thing
hey im not gonna judge

i dont care if
youre into kink

it just breaks her down
when shes stuck in her head
okay

your ring back
yeah you did

that id have a brain trauma
and forget our breakup
and come waltzing
into your office
demanding answers
whats wrong with you
im sorry im gonna
let you go back to work
sure
sorry
im sorry
i was not expecting that
habit i guess
i honestly didnt even know
where i was headed until
i found myself here
it just seems
so ridiculous to me
that i shut everyone out
for five years
it just doesnt feel right
hey
hey
how was your day
uh
it was fine
im just happy to
be home with you
sorry about the mess here
no problem
what are you collaging

no not that i remember
no you know
i was just so inspired
just seeing
everybody last night
to collage
all those memories
just came flooding
back to me
so i thought
id make a timeline
you know of my life
thats thats great
thats a great idea
yeah
i kind of rummaged through
some of your stuff
i hope you dont mind
its fine its fine
whats mine is yours
i even have a certificate
from the state of illinois
to prove it
yes i found that
its in the lost years
see i started over here
i found some family photos
me when i was little
stuff like that
that was easy to put
into chronological order
because i remember
that stuff
thats good right
yeah yeah i guess so
but what ive
been trying to do
is pinpoint
the last memory i had
before everything
just went blank
hows that going
i think i was
at the macaroni grill
and i was asking them
if they had those special
toasted ravioli
and i dont
remember the answer
thats it thats all
thats my last memory
before i woke up
in a hospital
oh no
how are we ever gonna know
if they had toasted ravioli
god this is
not happening
its okay
this is not happening
okay no no no no
please dont do that
come on
what
what are you doing
im sorry
im sorry was that
that was one of our things
yeah kind of it
im sorry
no you dont have
to say it
you dont i get it
itll all come back
we just have to keep
doing what were doing
let you fall back
into your life
itll
all sort itself out
yeah
about a dozen downtown
businesses were boarded up
about a dozen downtown
businesses were boarded up
glass littered sidewalks
following two nights
of protests
over the police
shooting of an
hey
there were few people
on the street
i think im ready
to see my studio now
will you show it to me
yeah
come on
this is the first studio
youve ever had to yourself
its a cool space huh
wow
you werent sure
you liked it at first
though
until you had this idea
to burn some smudge stick
that you bought from some guy
on the corner of diversey
we lit this thing
and we started
waving it around
until we realized
that it was just some
old pieces of lettuce
so were waving around
burning lettuce
i dont know
but it mustve done
the trick though
cause after that
i couldnt get you
out of here
you would come in
and crank your music
and youd get lost
in a project
and id have to
come and remind you
that it was nighttime
this is one of your pieces
for the tribune tower series
what is it
supposed to be
im not sure if
you even knew yet
but come here
i
here
just help it figure out
what it wants to be
okay
i dont
i dont really know
how to use this thing
sure you do
wait hold on
thats better come on
just try it
it might be fun
can you just turn down
the music please
i swear you used
to listen to it
so much louder than this
i never could understand
how you would just
be able to focus
i have a clinically bad
goddamn headache
please turn down the music
im trying to help you
but i am not
your punching bag
we dont speak to
each other like this
this is hard for me
too paige
paige
yeah
hey
hey
i passed by that
little portuguese bakery
that you love
on the way home
and i got us some
is somebody here
yeah
leo
hey
my sisters just
up to her eyeballs
with this wedding stuff
and weve got
the engagement party
coming up
and we all thought
paige could come home
and help her out
it just seems like
the right thing to do
to be there for gwen
okay but what
about your life here
what about all the work
that you havent finished
i talked to the people
at the tribune
and they were
really understanding
about the accident
and dads gonna
loan me the money
to pay back
their advance so
i dont know
i just i cant do it
you just come out
when youre ready honey
okay thanks dad
im sorry its just
until after the wedding
i just want you to
be careful okay
well im not
joining a cult
im just going to
stay with my family
i know but
but what
can i at least give you
an awkward hug
so how are you feeling
mmm i feel fine
yeah no dizziness
disorientation sleepiness
nope
great
well im very happy
and your ct scan
looks excellent
oh
what a relief well
so your memory recall
anything
not really
no huh
thats not normal is it
listen when it comes
to the brain
nothing is normal
because
no two brain injuries
are the same
paige seems
perfectly herself again
its wonderful
mrs thornton could
i just talk to paige alone
for a moment please
its okay mom
im im good
all right
thanks
paige do you want
to regain your memory
yes
because
some patients fear
that when their memory
comes back
so will the memory
of the trauma
but mercifully
thats rarely the case
oh no thats not it
im im
im not afraid
of the accident
so what are you afraid of
i guess i just
i dont know its
i mean what if i dont
like the life that i had
or what if
i like it too much
i
i just dont know
i only did
one psych rotation
so this may be
terrible advice
but i think you have to
try and fill the holes
you can still decide
you want a different life
but if you dont
at least
open yourself up
to remembering
im afraid youre
gonna live in fear
of your own past
hey im here
these guys are
knife skillz with a z
right
okay mikey sounds amazing
lets just go for it
i am going for it
the bass line
is one note
just one note
okay cool

you look different
yeah going for
a kanye kind of thing
im gonna say
more michael bublé
but whatever
its still good
hmm
so im gonna be
in and out for a while
sounds really good
mikey
lets just take it from
the top or the middle
or wherever
you know what
people come here to
work with you okay
i mean im doing my best
but you gotta be here
i know
but if paige is
in lake forest
with her family

its like panic
or excitement
well panic and excitement

hey do you also
have a little tingling
in your fingers
yeah is that bad
do you listen
to radiohead
uhhuh
thom yorke he talks about
dizzy spells all the time
he says when
his fingers tingle
thats how he knows
that hes creating
something genius
and then he gets
so amped up playing
that he almost passes out
ryan it sounds to me
like youre on
the verge of genius
thats cool man
cheers

i want you to meet
mom you listen
to radiohead
yeah why wouldnt i
so is that true
mmmhmm
paige

thinking about something
okay
whats your favorite book

what you remember
thats fine
thats not the point
okay the beach house
by james patterson
no really
yeah
okay the beach house
okay if it was great
you probably loaned it
to somebody right
yeah gwen i think
okay and you probably
said to yourself
god i wish
i was the person
that hadnt read it
so that i could
experience it
all over again
yeah i guess so
thats how i think
we should look at this
what
you cant remember how we met
mmmhmm
and you cant remember
how we fell in love
and in a way
yeah that sucks
but it was
the greatest time of my life
i just thought
how cool it would be
to get to experience it
all over again
like reading your favorite
book for the first time
exactly
got you
which is why i want to
ask you out on a date
a date
like two people that are just
meeting for the first time
jeremy
yeah im sorry
well i dont know
i mean you know
weve got
the wedding coming up
but if we go out
before then
you might still be able
to take me as your date
i cant promise anything
but ill put in
a good word for you
all right
yeah
a date
so i have an idea
but it involves
going into the city

yeah thats fine
i just have to be back

inviting yourself
to stay the night

scandalized is all

if you wanna
stay the night thats
i mean its
if you want
you wanna just see
how it goes all right
you can love me foolishly
love me foolishlike
well i wake
in the morning and dress
should we get out
we dont have to
is this the part of the date
where i find out
youre not
actually my husband
but some crazy stalker
and youre gonna strangle me
with my purse
no this is
the exact parking spot
where we first met
oh
im gonna take you on
a little retrospective of us
mmm
that is so good
you ready for dessert
dessert
hmm
we just had waffles
mmmmmm
this is dinner
these are dessert

its part of the fun
wed be surprised
by the ones we liked
and the ones we didnt
okay
and
you dont like it
i do not like that one
here try this one
i think youd
like this one
oh
mmm
told you
okay
your turn
are we going
shot for shot
wait till you try
their hot chocolate
we would come here
whenever it snowed
are you trying to make me
diabetic or just fat
no i
you got a
its still in your hair
so we come
down here at night
and look at the lake
thats not
exactly what we do
i im not
i dont
no no its not that
we said wed go in
once a month every month
and we havent
done april yet
we started in july
why why would we do that
we were at
this spaghetti place
and we had this waiter
and he said he did it
and he was like 80
so we thought we could
yeah
now we said
no wetsuits but
youre serious
for you i guess
ill make an exception
all right turn around
turn around
okay
wait no wetsuit
we said no wetsuits right
yeah
oh no
no no no no
come on
thank you
heat heat
my left eyelids
frozen shut
i cant feel my fingers
i cant feel them
i dont know
what your paige
did on a first date
but with me youre
only getting to first base
okay
im sorry
i can do better
my my lips
are still numb
its nice
second base tops
this is perfect
thank you for coming out
with me tonight
i had a really nice time
ive missed you
i miss our life together
i miss being with you
i love you
i should
probably get inside
good night
good night
hey
hey i didnt know
you were gonna be here
were you out
with jeremy
no
i was with leo
i like him
yeah
me too
are you okay
paige ive never seen
you like this before
i mean is this
crying thing the new you
because its bizarre
i dont know
i dont know whats me
i have a tattoo
and im a vegetarian too
look it was just
like it used to be
it was better actually
everything that
i fell in love with
about paige
is still there
you know to you
im sure it seemed
like a confirmation
of your love
or your marriage right
but to her
it probably seemed more
like a really good
first date
exactly which is why
i think youve gotta wait
the requisite three days
before you call
i gotta wait three days
to call after a date
with my own wife
at least
this is a unique case
maybe longer
it cant be longer
im gonna see her
on saturday at the wedding
im telling you
it was so obvious
even with all this crazy shit
going on around us
we still belong together
obvious to her
or to you
to both of us
oh oh paige
yeah
we have to start writing out
those place cards
after we eat
yes
before you start on that
i have a little surprise
for you paige
oh
you know ray porter
right
he taught constitutional law
at northwestern
he and i were on
law review together
weve known each other
1000 years
he is the dean of
the law school now
okay
and theyre gonna
let you back in
what
well
i didnt even apply
i took care of it
this is crazy
i feel like im getting
a free doover in life
you look like
you could use a drink
ive already had several
but you havent had this
all right
im glad were
having a moment alone
i havent gotten a chance
to really talk to you leo
yeah
yeah cool
congratulations
thats nice
yes it is
ive been thinking
and i think that
its probably time to
let us take it from here
take what
things with paige
look i know she didnt have
health insurance because
you chose to live
in a certain way
and i know you must
be drowning in debt
but i also know
a way out of this
whats that
divorce her
the bills have
only just begun leo
mr thornton i dont think
this is the time
or the place to discuss this
fine if you dont care
about losing your business
which clearly you dont
what about paige
what about doing
what is obviously
the right thing for her
and you know
whats right for her
as a matter of fact i do
youre such a hypocrite
what did you say
if youre such
a family man how come i
i never once saw
you come and try
to put things back
together with paige
youre such a coward
hey can i introduce
you around a little bit
cant feel good to
be the odd man out
im not the odd man out
all right
if you say so
you just seem a little creepy
over here all by yourself
im just waiting
for paige man
all right well
best of luck with that
you like this right
im sorry like what
paige leaves you behind
she goes and has
this life without you
with some guy
that no one gets
and now you get to
see her reject all that
i mean i like it
a little bit
yeah
well let me
tell you what i like
i like the fact
that paige told me
everything about you
jeremy
okay
she told me that
when she was with you
she would wake up
at night in a panic
thinking
is this all there is
wow
she told you
everything huh
mmmhmm
did she tell you
that she threw herself
at me the other day
did she tell you that
or did she stop
telling you everything
when she forgot
who the hell you were
look i get why
youre being such a dick
you obviously love her
and you think youre
gonna get her back
but the thing is
she outgrew you
what makes you think
that wont happen again
thank you for that advice
i will mull it over while
im in bed with your wife
leo
paige wait
what the hell
were you thinking
i dont know thats
a really good question
because i have been
driving myself insane
making a complete ass
of myself
literally trying
everything possible
to try to save
what we have
and youve been
throwing yourself
at jeremy
thats not fair
its not fair
i see the way
you look at him
i know
because you used to
look at me that way
leo i
no i think we need to
start being realistic
your memorys
not coming back
the fact is that
im still just a stranger
im not trying
to hurt you
but im just
im so tired of
disappointing you
i know
im so sorry
ill apologize
to gwen and ryan
oh god no its fine
wedding disasters
have a way of turning
into great stories
eventually
how do you look at
the girl you love
and tell yourself
its time to walk away
leo
i hope one day i can love
the way that you love me
you figured it out once
youll do it again
shit
youre here not there
are you okay
im done
its over i give up
no you never give up leo
no if we were
meant to be together
we would be together
i was just thinking
about the first time
that we went to
that greek restaurant
on the corner
there was
this big banner saying
now serving soup
and i just started to
go on and on
about all the obstacles
that the owner
must have overcome
to achieve his lifelong dream
of serving soup
and then
and when i was finished
she didnt say anything
for a few seconds
and she just
she just sort of exhaled it
it was almost to herself
i love you
and it just hung there
it was the first time
she had said it
and i didnt
even wanna respond
i just wanted to
keep hearing it
that was two weeks
after we met
it only took her two weeks
to fall in love
with me before
she doesnt love me
sign here please
come here
little buddy
diane
hey
how are you
listen
i know its been years
i was away for a while
i never had a chance
to apologize
i was just going through
a really weird time
but your dad ended it
as soon as your mother
confronted him about us
and i just always
wanted you to know that
i dont mean to
open old wounds but
i just really needed
to say that im sorry
no im really glad
that you said something
you were always
a really good friend
i just wish i couldve
returned the favor
the lilies were bad
so i got sunflowers instead
i wanted to tell you
you knew
you knew the whole time
im sorry
dont talk to me
paige paige paige
hey where have you
been all day stranger
hmm
paige
i ran into diane chain
at the store
thats why i left isnt it
because i found out
mom i barely
even know who i am
and then it turns out
youre lying to me
and youve used my accident
to rewrite the past
i couldnt bear the thought
of losing you again
do you have any idea
how betrayed i feel
right now
im sorry paige
we were happier than
wed been in years
oh mom
we finally
had you back again
back on your terms
no
yes as usual
paige
he cheated on you
with my friend
how could you
stay with him
i
i was going to leave
i was
i was all ready to leave
and then one afternoon
i was all alone
in the house
and i started looking at
all the photographs of you
and your
and your sister
and the house seemed
so full of all of us
we were a family paige
and i realized
in that moment that
that was
the most important thing
in the world for me
and i couldnt
i couldnt
i could not go
so you just
wasped it away
no
i chose to stay with him
for all the things
that he had done right
and not to leave him
for the one thing
that he had done wrong
i chose to forgive him
maybe leo was right
maybe i cant
figure out who i am
and be around all of you
i still feel
a little chilly i dont
care what you say
thats fine
paige
im sorry
is everything okay
look you two
obviously need to talk
so im just
okay
talk to you later
all right bye
im im sorry
what happened
can i ask you something
yeah
you can always
ask me anything
did you know
about my dads affair
yeah
i knew
why didnt you tell me
there were so many times
that i almost did
but to drive you away
from your family again
that just felt wrong
i wanted your love i
just not like that
i wanted to earn it
i just dont think
i can afford to
lose them right now
so dont
certain parties
have sought to nullify
various congressional acts
claiming that
repeated extensions
of copyright protection
constitute
a perpetual copyright
of the sort the drafters
of the constitution
would have rejected
the united states
supreme court
in the 2003 case
of eldred v ashcroft
thanks for lunch
actually theres something
that i wanted to tell you
okay
things are over
with rose
i ended it paige
no why did you do that
i thought you were
getting engaged
we were
but that was before you
no that was after me
okay it was after you
but it was before this you
it was before
the old you came back
jeremy im not the old me
im just me
im just the me thats trying
to figure it out still
i understand
but whichever it is
the old you or the new you
i dont care
i know you remember
what we were like together
i know you do
this is our chance
to get that back
what we had was wonderful
those were wonderful memories
but those were
those are my only memories
everything
after you is erased
i
i have to discover
what its like to be
without you on my own
are you sure
you dont remember
breaking up with me
the first time
why
cause it sounded
a hell of a lot like that
lets go
hey
i was looking all over
i was worried
when i didnt see you
outside the library
so
hows that intellectual
property class going
actually i wanna
talk to you about that
ive decided to
leave law school
and im gonna get
an apartment in the city
its happening
all over again isnt it
damn it paige
ive made a lot
of mistakes
dad this isnt about you
or anything youve done
this is about me
who i want to be who i am
just tell me what to say
so i dont lose you again
you wont
a moment of impact
a moment of impact
whose potential for change
has ripple effects
far beyond what
we can predict
sending some particles
crashing together
making them
closer than before
while sending
others spinning off
into great ventures
landing where
you never thought
youd find them
you see thats the thing
about moments like these
you cant
no matter how hard you try
control how
theyre gonna affect you
you just gotta let
the colliding particles
land where they may
and wait until
the next collision
i vow to
help you love life
to always hold you
with tenderness
and to have the patience
that love demands
to speak when
words are needed
and to share the silence
when theyre not
to agree to disagree
on red velvet cake
and to live within
the warmth of your heart
and always call it home
hi
hi
i hope you didnt
come all the way
into the city
for hot chocolate
actually i moved
back here six months ago
im over in rogers park
really that
thats great
im actually back
at the art institute
what
are you kidding me
mmmmmm
thats amazing
yeah i mean
im sitting in
on a few classes
and its crazy
what my hands remember
that my you know
that my mind forgot
yeah
so thank you
i didnt do anything
you did everything
you accepted me for who i am
and not for
what you wanted me to be
i just wanted you
to be happy
thats all
isnt there some
cuban place around here
where we used to go
when this place was closed
yeah its wait
you remember
no no
i wish
no the memory stuff
hasnt come back but ive
sonia and i have been
hanging out a little bit
and ive been
asking her about us
really
and what has she been saying
that she doesnt think youre
seeing anyone right now
she just happens
to be right
you are you seeing anyone
thats good
so do you wanna go
to the cuban place
with me
okay
okay
what would you say
to trying someplace
that we havent
been to before
someplace new
id like that
after you
ive been looking so long
at these pictures of you
that i almost believe
that theyre real
ive been living so long
with my pictures of you
that i almost believe
that the pictures are
all i can feel
remembering you
standing quiet in the rain
as i ran to your heart
to be near
and we kissed
as the sky fell in
holding you close
how i always held close
in your fear
remembering you
running soft through the night
you were bigger and brighter
and wider than snow
and screamed
at the makebelieve
screamed at the sky
and you finally found
all your courage
to let it all go
remembering you
fallen into my arms
crying for the death
of your heart
you were stone white
so delicate
lost in the cold
you were always
so lost in the dark
remembering you
how you used to be
slow drowned
you were angels
so much more
than everything
hold for the last time
then slip away quietly
open my eyes
but i never see anything
if only id thought
of the right words
i could have held on
to your heart
if only id thought
of the right words
i wouldnt be
breaking apart
all my pictures of you
looking so long
at these pictures of you
but i never hold on
to your heart
there was nothing
in the world
that i ever wanted more
than to feel you
deep in my heart
there was nothing
