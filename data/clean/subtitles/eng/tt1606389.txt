it s good 
it s good  it s good 
i can t feel my fingers 
thank you 
      do anything for love
you do not like this song 
  i would do anything
for love
  i would do
anything for love
you have to turn it off 
  but i won t do that
  oh  no  i won t     
i m married to a cheeser 
please  stop 
you love it 
say you love it 
stop  ow 
stop it 
you love that song 
oh  leo 
hey  i have this theory 
mmm hmm 
that a girl s guaranteed
to get preggers
if she does it in a car 
what 
mmm hmm 
i have a theory  too 
my theory is about moments 
moments of impact 
my theory is that
these moments of impact 
these flashes
of high intensity
that completely turn
our lives upside down 
actually end up
defining who we are 
thanks 
next in line 
one of my absolute
favorite moments 
oh 
you forgot your permit 
yeah  well  i just sort of
come here to enjoy
the two hour line 
the permit s
sort of a bonus 
the art institute 
you work there 
no  i m a student 
i m paige 
i m sorry  i m leo 
well  thank you
for this  leo 
you know what 
i noticed  in a totally
non threatening way 
we have the same rpp zone 
is that right 
yup 
hmm 
you have impressive
powers of observation 
yes 
what s an rpp zone 
residential
permit parking zone 
oh 
that sounds intimate 
yeah 
okay 
what i was thinking
is that   
i think we owe it
to ourselves  really 
to maybe get a drink 
out of respect for our
zone compatibility and all 
okay 
okay 
mmm hmm 
all right  okay 
after you 
pick a hand 
pick a hand 
pick a hand 
that one 
here we go 
mmm 
mmm 
this is good 
  of the water s waves
  still i know you re
in the darkness shining
  when the sun
starts coming through
  or when the cardinal
chides the moon
let me know if you
need anything else 
  i believe in energies
  that no one has to see
for us to prove
  i believe in you and me
  and everything
we ll ever see and do
oh 
oh 
mmm 
  specks of gold
in the river running
  from the deep moonlight
  when the sun
starts coming through
  or when the cardinal
chides the moon
  that no one has to see
for us to prove
  the rain pours down
in a million rivers  
did you just fart 
no 
oh 
maybe a little 
that is so twisted 
but totally romantic 
god  i m so in love
with you  it s insane 
as you know 
your wife s ctscan
showed
intracranial hemorrhaging 
we purposely keep patients
with traumatic brain injuries
in a comatose state
in order to calm
their systems
and allow the brain time
to heal itself while
the swelling subsides 
and then we slowly
wean them off it  now   
the thing is 
each one of us is
the sum total of
every moment that
we ve ever experienced 
with all the people
we ve ever known 
and it s these moments
that become our history 
like our own
personal greatest hits
of memories that we play
and replay in our minds
over and over again 
aren t you hungry 
hey 
hi 
what you doing 
nothing 
really 
no 
what s that 
nothing 
oh  nothing 
food s ready 
look  if you keep
feeding that fleabag 
it s gonna
keep coming back
and i m allergic 
like you claim to be
allergic to cilantro 
i can t stand cilantro 
exactly 
but you re not allergic 
does anybody want
strawberries i bought
at the farmers  market 
buying groceries 
bad sign 
what 
and we all know
what that means 
i like her 
she s like our mascot 
thanks  i think 
i would rather have her
than that ferret you
tried to make us adopt 
and she
makes great coffee 
let s keep her 
thank you 
  have some 
  thank you 
 movie   i think you
spelled  movie  wrong 
no 
told you 
yes 
mmm hmm 
i vow to help you love life 
to always hold you
with tenderness 
and to have the patience
that love demands 
to speak when
words are needed
and to share the silence
when they re not 
to agree to disagree
on red velvet cake 
and to live within
the warmth of your heart
and always call it home 
wow  you set the bar
kind of high 
did you write
your vows on a menu 
yeah  why 
i vow to fiercely love you
in all your forms 
now and forever 
i promise to never forget
that this is
a once in a lifetime love 
and to always know
in the deepest part
of my soul
that no matter
what challenges
might carry us apart 
that we ll always
find the way back
to each other 
do you take each other
as spouses forever 
i do 
i do 
then by the power
vested in me by
the state of illinois  i   
security 
i now pronounce
you man and wife
and best friends for life 
kiss  run 
  you had to run
for the weekend
  and you had
nowhere to be
  you had enough
of the sorrow
  and it was all on tv
  you blew a kiss
to a goodbye and
  that s how you met me
  oh  it s ours
  oh  it s ours
  oh  it s ours
  oh  it s ours  
i have one piece 
one piece 
it s   
it s not happening 
i don t   
oh  my god 
you re gonna be fine 
oh  my god  i m gonna
have to call them 
i m gonna have to call them
and tell them
that i can t do it 
come to bed with me 
come on 
i know you wanna
come to bed with me 
don t 
oh  no  please  no 
stop it 
okay  okay  okay 
i think this one s
coming along fine 
i mean 
i know it s not finished 
but i m already starting
to see a mood 
it s got like
a darkening curtain thing
happening there 
and then a competing
light element  there 
mmm hmm 
it s abstract  but 
i mean  i don t know 
i kind of think
it s already powerful 
what 
you totally love me 
yeah  i do 
yeah 
i know because
this is my piece 
and that s the scrap pile 
which i m now saving 
hmm 
a moment of
total physical  mental 
and every other kind of love 
don t crowd her 
she s gonna be
a little groggy 
so let s just
give her some space 
hey 
it s so good to see you 
paige 
it s okay 
you re in the hospital 
you were in a car accident 
you hit your head 
but you re okay 
we just kept you asleep
for a little while 
how do you feel 
my head hurts 
yeah  well 
that s perfectly normal 
i ll get you
something for that 
was anyone else hurt 
doctor 
uh   
paige 
you know who i am  right 
yeah  you re my doctor 
um   
i m your husband 
paige 
mr  collins 
you said things
were very good 
a brain injury isn t
like a broken bone
or a laceration 
brains are
much less predictable 
sometimes  due to the way
the swelling tissue
presses against the skull 
it can cause
some impairment 
some impairment 
she doesn t remember me 
even though she s awake 
the swelling
can cause confusion
or memory loss 
erratic mood swings 
what 
but that s normal 
so  that s my theory 
that these moments of impact
define who we are 
but what i never considered
was what if  one day 
you could no longer
remember any of them 
hi 
what are you up to 
sleeping 
right 
i brought you some clothes 
thank you 
i m kind of hungry 
okay 
come on 
so  i just wanted to
verify a few things
with you about me 
about us 
great 
so  we re married 
yes 
yeah 
and i have weird hair 
i think that s
taking a narrow view 
you said it takes
too long to straighten
and you d rather
use that time to
work in your studio 
my studio 
why do i have a studio 
you re an artist 
sculptor 
a really good one 
right now  you re
working on four pieces
for the tribune tower lobby 
which is huge 
everyone in town
wanted that commission 
but your show at
the mca s 12 x 12
was amazing 
so you won it 
what about my law degree 
i don t have a law degree 
i think you were
a few credits shy 
last time i wanted
to be an artist 
i was in high school 
i think you need to
look at it like a win 
traumatic brain injury
is a win 
you re an idiot 
if she doesn t
remember who you are 
then she doesn t remember
all the stupid shit
you ever did 
you can start over 
wipe the slate clean 
i m just worried if
she doesn t remember you 
how s she going to
remember she s in love
with you  what 
i was frankly
a little stunned
she went for you
the first time 
if anything  you ve
become less attractive 
you guys are
a great support system 
seriously  though 
what if she doesn t
remember me 
then what 
she s gonna remember you 
she s gonna
remember all of us 
we re her family 
yeah  you re right 
excuse me  i m looking
for my wife  paige collins 
she was right
over here yesterday 
well  it looks like
they moved her up
to the vip floor 
that sounds expensive 
it s a donor s wing 
just go down here
and take the elevator
to the second floor
and make a right 
okay  thanks 
paige  your long term
memory recall is intact
and i m very optimistic
the rest of your memory is
going to improve with time 
mr  collins 
i m so glad you re here 
this is bizarre 
i m leo  paige s husband 
do you know
how disconcerting it was
to hear second hand
that my daughter had been
in the icu for weeks
and we hadn t been told 
you should have
called us 
i m sorry 
you ve never
met my parents 
i don t understand 
why haven t you met him 
so  doctor 
now what is
the next step 
the sooner
she settles back
into her life 
her normal routine 
the better 
starting in a week or so 
i m gonna recommend
that paige see
a neural psychologist 
  okay 
  whatever she needs 
therapy  specialists 
i ll make sure
she gets the best 
you ll come home
where i can
take care of you 
mom can make up
your old room 
and i can take
some time off work 
i don t mean to
be disrespectful 
 cause we really
appreciate that 
but you just heard
paige s doctor say
that she needs to go back
to her normal routine 
her life with me is
her normal routine 
yes  but that s a life
she doesn t remember 
she will 
that s what her doctor
just got through saying 
no  what she said was that
maybe paige will remember 
now  why not
let her come home
and recover with
people that she knows 
and loves 
we re only trying to
do the best for paige 
that s interesting 
 cause you haven t
even asked her once 
well  no  but   
what i really need
is for everyone
to just stop bickering 
listen  none of this needs
to be decided right now 
no  sorry 
i think you should all
head home  get some rest 
i m sure everyone
could use it 
how is it that
you re my husband
and you ve
never met my family 
you haven t spoken
to them in years 
why would i ever stop
speaking to my family 
it all went down
before we met 
and we never talked about it 
no  we did 
so 
for starters  you wanted
to move into the city
and go to the art institute 
and your father insisted
that you stay in law school 
he had some
pretty strict views
on what you ought
to be doing 
things just
spiraled from there 
okay  look 
what i remember is
being in law school
and being engaged to jeremy 
i    i don t know 
paige 
okay  babe  babe 
just  just   
the best thing to do
at this point
is to go back
to your life with me 
you heard what
the doctor said 
it s the best thing
for your recovery 
okay  but i don t know you 
and i m just supposed
to get in your car
and go and live
at your place 
it s our place 
without any proof of us
even being in love 
other than our marriage 
people get married for all
kinds of different reasons 
okay  like 
like for a green card 
i m from cincinnati 
did i keep a journal 
no  not that i know of 
i guess this is
all he could find 
oh  well 
it looks fine  honey 
i mean 
we re just going home  so   
it s horrible   
paige 
i understand you re
finally leaving us 
oh  yes  that s
what they tell me 
so  no driving until
i give you the say so 
but other than that 
i m gonna see you
in four to six weeks 
all right 
thank you so much 
thank you  doctor 
for everything 
thank you  doctor 
okay 
you ready  let s go 
wait  hold on 
i got a voicemail 
it s from
before the accident 
you said
you wanted evidence 
okay  yeah 
well  let s have a listen 
hey  baby 
ugh  i m sorry 
i m still at my studio 
i miss you so bad
my sculptures are starting
to look like you 
so  what are
you doing later 
i kind of need some leo time 
if you know what i mean 
yeah  anyway  call me back 
love you 
i don t know  i guess
in listening back to it 
it doesn t
exactly prove anything 
no  no  it s   
it s cute 
i mean  i sound happy 
okay  look 
think about it 
you quit law school 
you broke off your engagement
and you moved
into the city 
those were all
choices that you made 
way before
you even met me 
i think that
you owe it to yourself
to honor those decisions 
at least for right now 
this is a mistake  paige 
i promise that
i will take care of her 
please  come home with me 
come home with me 
we ll figure
this out together 
i guess i could
just try it out
to see if it would
help my memory and   
mmm hmm 
i could always come home
if i change my mind 
i married him  it must
have been for some reason 
a guarded endorsement 
but i will take it 
i look like a freak 
i think you look great 
where do we live 
on the north side 
who s the president 
of the country 
yeah 
obama 
the senator 
yeah  you voted for him 
i did 
welcome home 
after you 
surprise 
uh   
it s good to see you 
we were there every day
at the hospital 
but leo didn t want us
to overwhelm you 
yeah  they were 
every day 
we really missed you 
i gather we re close 
i m sonia  and this
is my boyfriend kyle 
hey  paige 
and this is jim 
you look great  paige 
and lily 
hey  what  were you  like 
working out at the hospital 
  hey  paige 
  and josh 
i    sorry  i    excuse me 
thank you all for coming 
i m sorry it ended early 
it s all right 
take care  leo 
are you okay 
what do you think 
i know  it s a lot to take in 
no 
a lot to take in
would ve been coming home 
to a strange apartment 
with a man i don t know 
that would be
a lot to take in 
but coming home
to all of that 
plus a house
full of people
pulling on me 
and hugging me 
and crying in my face 
and talking about more shit
that i don t remember 
that s not a lot to take in 
that s total bullshit 
you re right 
it was only supposed
to be a few people 
will you please just get out 
paige  i m sorry 
are you honestly not
gonna leave me alone 
i m sorry 
i m sorry 
of course 
i m sorry 
oh

seen it before  come on 
this is not funny 
you should knock 
i m sorry 
you look nice 
really 
this is about the only
piece of my clothing
i feel comfortable in 
that s mine  actually 
oh 
no  it s fine 
what 
huh 
you re looking at me
like i m some kind
of zoo animal 
sorry  i don t know 
i m just trying
to figure this out 
too  i guess 
you normally do all this 
this is my apology
for last night 
that was such
a bonehead move 
i just wasn t thinking 
no  please 
i m sorry  i   
i don t want you to
worry about me  okay 
just go about your
normal routine and   
do you work 
do you have a job 
yeah  well  that s
if i m still in business 
i own a recording studio 
hmm  cool 
so  what is my routine 
what do i do all day 
well   
you usually get up
and make coffee 
all right 
no  no  no 
i got it  i got it  i got it 
i did it this morning 
i think 
and then you   
oh  no  don t 
that one s for me 
you don t eat meat 
oh 
then you check e mails
and pay bills 
okay 
which i m betting
that you don t remember
any of the passwords
or account numbers  huh 
mmm mmm 
so  i guess
i ll do that 
okay 
and then you go down
to your studio 
i could take you down there 
show you what
you re working on 
you know what 
we don t have to rehash
everything right now 
i mean  just   
you go to work

flashcards later

i don t think
i m gonna keep him
in rotation 
okay 
honestly  though 
it s actually been hell 
yesterday  we were
somehow double booked 
too many clients 
that s a high class problem 
yeah 
but with only one studio 
it s pretty impossible
to take on both gigs 
right  so  dune advertising
weren t flexible
and they rebooked
over at soundspace 
wait  what  come on 
that s a big account 
they should always
be prioritized 
you know that 
yeah  look   
i can t run the sessions
and handle account
services  right 
this isn t
a one woman operation 
it s not like
i flaked or something 
i know  i get it

to always hold you
with tenderness 
and to have the patience
that love demands 
to speak when
words are needed
and to share the silence
when they re not 
to agree to disagree
on red velvet cake 
and to live within
the warmth of your heart
and always call it home 
did you write
your vows on a menu 
weird 
i vow
to fiercely love you
in all your forms 
now and forever 
i promise to never forget
that this is
a once in a lifetime love 
and to always know
in the deepest part
of my soul

that fortune just multiplies 
paige  honey 
welcome home

both my parents are dead

she s my family now 
and what kind of
work do you do  leo 
i just opened up my own
recording studio downtown 
paige actually convinced me
to turn it into a business 
i did 
yeah 
isn t that sort
of a dying field 
no  i just mean 
can t people record things
on their computers at home
and they sound just as good 
ryan 
what 
look  the records
that i like 
they have life
and warmth and soul 
like the slapback
on scotty moore s guitar
on mystery train 
look 
you re not gonna get that
in your computer 
you re gonna want
a live room  you re gonna
want to bounce to tape 
you re gonna want
real musicians in a room 
vibing off of each other 
you   
i guess 
to answer your question 
it may be a dying field
and you can record
high quality stuff at home 
but  i mean  come on 
you can t get
the sun sessions
on your laptop 
wow 
wow 
wow 
wow 
i heard everyone is
gonna be here tonight

hi 
paige s husband 
right 
i m gonna grab a drink 
you guys want anything

yes  i remember 
oh  my god  paige 
do you remember
when we were
in the ninth grade 
and we were getting ready
for the christmas dance 
we were
curling your hair   
we ended up
burning off half your hair 
i totally remember that 
and didn t i wind up
having to wear a beret
to the dance 
no  no  no 
that was the   
it was like she was
some sweater set wearing 
mojito drinking
sorority girl 
like a stepford wife 
yeah  basically 
she was even
flirting with jeremy
right in front of me 
ex fiancé jeremy 
no  no  no 
in her mind 
it s current fiancé jeremy 
which is why

wow  thought you
weren t gonna judge 
i m not  i m just    i   
i don t care if

pre wedding dumping 
why 
well  that s a question
that i and all of my friends
and the two rebound girls 
yeah  we d all
love an answer to 
come on  seriously 
i must have had
some kind of reason 
you   
you    you changed 
you talked differently 
you dressed differently 
you weren t sure
about law school anymore 
and you definitely weren t
sure about me anymore 
did i give you
your ring back

no one yet 
but i ve been with rose 
you remember 
from gwen s class

have anticipated
that i d have a brain trauma
and forget our break up
and come waltzing
into your office
demanding answers 
what s wrong with you 
i m sorry  i m gonna
let you go back to work 
sure 
sorry 
i m sorry 
i was not expecting that 
habit  i guess 
i honestly didn t even know
where i was headed until
i found myself here 
it just seems
so ridiculous to me
that i shut everyone out
for five years 
it just doesn t feel right 
hey 
hey 
how was your day 
uh   
it was fine 
i m just happy to
be home with you 
sorry about the mess here 
no problem 
what  are you collaging 
do i collage 
no  not that i remember 
no  you know 
i was just so inspired
just seeing
everybody last night 
to collage 
all those memories
just came flooding
back to me 
so i thought
i d make a timeline 
you know  of my life 
that s    that s great 
that s a great idea 
yeah 
i kind of rummaged through
some of your stuff 
i hope you don t mind 
it s fine  it s fine 
what s mine is yours 
i even have a certificate
from the state of illinois
to prove it 
yes  i found that 
it s in the lost years 
see  i started over here 
i found some family photos 
me when i was little 
stuff like that 
that was easy to put
into chronological order
because i remember
that stuff 
that s good  right 
yeah  yeah  i guess so 
but what i ve
been trying to do
is pinpoint
the last memory i had
before everything
just went blank 
how s that going 
i think i was
at the macaroni grill 
and i was asking them
if they had those special
toasted ravioli 
and i don t
remember the answer 
that s it  that s all 
that s my last memory
before i woke up
in a hospital 
oh  no 
how are we ever gonna know
if they had toasted ravioli 
god  this is
not happening 
it s okay 
this is not happening 
okay  no  no  no  no 
please don t do that 
come on 
what   
what are you doing 
i m sorry 
i m sorry  was that   
that was one of our things 
yeah  kind of  it   
i m sorry   
no  you don t have
to say it 
you don t  i get it 
it ll all come back 
we just have to keep
doing what we re doing 
let you fall back
into your life 
it ll
all sort itself out 
yeah 
about a dozen downtown
businesses were boarded up   
about a dozen downtown
businesses were boarded up   
glass littered sidewalks 
following two nights
of protests
over the police
shooting of an   
hey 
there were few people
on the street 
i think i m ready
to see my studio now 
will you show it to me 
yeah 
come on 
this is the first studio
you ve ever had to yourself 
it s a cool space  huh 
wow 
you weren t sure
you liked it at first 
though 
until you had this idea
to burn some smudge stick
that you bought from some guy
on the corner of diversey 
we lit this thing
and we started
waving it around
until we realized
that it was just some
old pieces of lettuce 
so  we re waving around
burning lettuce 
i don t know 
but it must ve done
the trick  though 
 cause after that 
i couldn t get you
out of here 
you would come in
and crank your music 
and you d get lost
in a project 
and i d have to
come and remind you
that it was night time 
this is one of your pieces
for the tribune tower series 
what is it
supposed to be 
i m not sure if
you even knew yet 
but come here 
i   
here 
just help it figure out
what it wants to be 
okay 
i don t   
i don t really know
how to use this thing 
sure you do 
wait  hold on 
that s better  come on 
just try it 
it might be fun 
can you just turn down
the music  please 
i swear you used
to listen to it
so much louder than this 
i never could understand
how you would just
be able to focus   
i have a clinically bad 
goddamn headache 
please turn down the music 
i m trying to help you 
but i am not
your punching bag 
we don t speak to
each other like this 
this is hard for me 
too  paige 
paige 
yeah 
hey 
hey 
i passed by that
little portuguese bakery
that you love
on the way home 
and i got us some   
is somebody here 
yeah 
leo 
hey 
my sister s just
up to her eyeballs
with this wedding stuff 
and we ve got
the engagement party
coming up 
and we all thought
paige could come home
and help her out 
it just seems like
the right thing to do 
to be there for gwen 
okay  but what
about your life here 
what about all the work
that you haven t finished 
i talked to the people
at the tribune 
and they were
really understanding
about the accident 
and dad s gonna
loan me the money
to pay back
their advance  so   
i don t know 
i just    i can t do it 
you just come out
when you re ready  honey 
okay  thanks  dad 
i m sorry  it s just
until after the wedding 
i just want you to
be careful  okay 
well  i m not
joining a cult 
i m just going to
stay with my family 
i know  but   
but what 
can i at least give you
an awkward hug 
so  how are you feeling 
mmm  i feel fine 
yeah  no dizziness 
disorientation  sleepiness 
nope 
great 
well  i m very happy 
and your ct scan
looks excellent 
oh 
what a relief  well   
so  your memory recall 
anything 
not really 
no  huh 
that s not normal  is it 
listen  when it comes
to the brain 
nothing is normal 
because
no two brain injuries
are the same 
paige seems
perfectly herself again 
it s wonderful 
mrs  thornton  could
i just talk to paige alone
for a moment  please 
it s okay  mom 
i m    i m good 
all right 
thanks 
paige  do you want
to regain your memory 
yes 
because
some patients fear
that when their memory
comes back 
so will the memory
of the trauma 
but mercifully
that s rarely the case 
oh  no  that s not it 
i m    i m   
i m not afraid
of the accident 
so  what are you afraid of 
i guess i just   
i don t know  it s   
i mean  what if i don t
like the life that i had 
or what if
i like it too much 
i   
i just don t know 
i only did
one psych rotation 
so this may be
terrible advice 
but i think you have to
try and fill the holes 
you can still decide
you want a different life 
but if you don t
at least
open yourself up
to remembering 
i m afraid you re
gonna live in fear
of your own past 
hey  i m here 
these guys are 
knife skillz  with a z 
right 
okay  mikey  sounds amazing 
let s just go for it 
i am going for it 
the bass line
is one note 
just one note 
okay  cool 
take two 
wow 
you look different 
yeah  going for
a kanye kind of thing 
i m gonna say
more michael bublé 
but  whatever 
it s still good 
hmm 
so    i m gonna be
in and out for a while 
sounds really good 
mikey 
let s just take it from
the top or the middle
or wherever 
you know what 
people come here to
work with you  okay 
i mean  i m doing my best 
but you gotta be here 
i know 
but if paige is
in lake forest
with her family 
that s where i gotta be 
i gotta make my wife
fall in love with me again 
  oh  you found each other 
  hi 
hi 
let s see it 
it s good to see you 
all right  take it easy 
the countdown s on  man 
hey  man 
one week left of
your former life 
how you feeling 
i feel pretty good 
actually 
i mean 
i do get a little dizzy
if i think about it
for too long  but   
what 
no  honey  it s like
a good dizzy  it s like   
it s like panic
or excitement 
well  panic and excitement
are different 
honey  there s gonna
be 400 people there 
right 
hey  do you also
have a little tingling
in your fingers 
yeah  is that bad 
do you listen
to radiohead 
uh huh 
thom yorke  he talks about
dizzy spells all the time 
he says when
his fingers tingle 
that s how he knows
that he s creating
something genius 
and then he gets
so amped up playing
that he almost passes out 
ryan  it sounds to me
like you re on
the verge of genius 
that s cool  man 
cheers 
ooh  ryan  i have someone
i want you to meet 
mom  you listen
to radiohead 
yeah  why wouldn t i 
so  is that true 
mmm hmm 
paige 
hey  leo 
what 
your hair 
it looks so different 
you look beautiful 
thank you 
okay  look  so i ve been
thinking about something 
okay 
what s your favorite book 
it s probably not
what you remember 
that s fine 
that s not the point 
okay  the beach house
by james patterson 
no  really 
yeah 
okay  the beach house 
okay  if it was great 
you probably loaned it
to somebody  right 
yeah  gwen  i think 
okay  and you probably
said to yourself 
 god  i wish
i was the person
that hadn t read it 
 so that i could
experience it
all over again  
yeah  i guess so 
that s how i think
we should look at this 
what 
you can t remember how we met 
mmm hmm 
and you can t remember
how we fell in love 
and in a way 
yeah  that sucks 
but it was
the greatest time of my life 
i just thought
how cool it would be
to get to experience it
all over again 
like reading your favorite
book for the first time 
exactly 
got you 
which is why i want to
ask you out on a date 
a date 
like two people that are just
meeting for the first time 
jeremy   
yeah  i m sorry 
well  i don t know 
i mean  you know 
we ve got
the wedding coming up 
but if we go out
before then 
you might still be able
to take me as your date 
i can t promise anything 
but i ll put in
a good word for you 
all right 
yeah 
a date 
so  i have an idea 
but it involves
going into the city 
you okay with that 
yeah  that s fine 
i just have to be back
by 10 00 in the morning 
oh  my god 
what 
first date
and you re already
inviting yourself
to stay the night 
i m just a little
scandalized is all 
no  i just meant   
don t worry 
i ll have you back tonight 
if you wanna
stay the night  that s   
i mean  it s   
if you want   
you wanna just see
how it goes  all right 
  you can love me foolishly
  love me foolish like
  well  i wake
  in the morning and dress  
should we get out 
we don t have to 
is this the part of the date
where i find out
you re not
actually my husband
but some crazy stalker 
and you re gonna strangle me
with my purse 
no  this is
the exact parking spot
where we first met 
oh 
i m gonna take you on
a little retrospective of us 
mmm 
that is so good 
you ready for dessert 
dessert 
hmm 
we just had waffles 
mmm mmm 
this is dinner 
these are dessert 
well  how do you know
what flavors they all are 
it s like a chocolate
russian roulette 
it s part of the fun 
we d be surprised
by the ones we liked
and the ones we didn t 
okay 
and   
you don t like it 
i do not like that one 
here  try this one 
i think you d
like this one 
oh 
mmm 
told you 
okay 
your turn 
are we going
shot for shot 
wait till you try
their hot chocolate 
we would come here
whenever it snowed 
are you trying to make me
diabetic or just fat 
no  i   
you got a   
it s still in your hair 
so  we come
down here at night
and look at the lake 
that s not
exactly what we do 
i    i m not   
i don t   
no  no  it s not that 
we said we d go in
once a month every month 
and we haven t
done april yet 
we started in july 
why  why would we do that 
we were at
this spaghetti place 
and we had this waiter
and he said he did it 
and he was  like  80 
so we thought we could 
yeah 
now  we said
no wetsuits  but   
you re serious 
   for you  i guess
i ll make an exception 
all right  turn around 
turn around 
okay 
wait  no wetsuit 
we said no wetsuits  right 
yeah 
oh  no 
no  no  no  no 
come on 
thank you 
heat  heat 
my left eyelid s
frozen shut 
i can t feel my fingers 
i can t feel them 
i don t know
what your paige
did on a first date 
but with me  you re
only getting to first base 
okay 
i m sorry 
i can do better 
my    my lips
are still numb 
it s nice 
second base  tops 
this is perfect 
thank you for coming out
with me tonight 
i had a really nice time 
i ve missed you 
i miss our life together 
i miss being with you 
i love you 
i should
probably get inside 
good night 
good night 
hey 
hey  i didn t know
you were gonna be here 
were you out
with jeremy 
no 
i was with leo 
i like him 
yeah 
me  too 
are you okay 
paige  i ve never seen
you like this before 
i mean  is this
crying thing the new you 
because it s bizarre 
i don t know 
i don t know what s me 
i have a tattoo 
and i m a vegetarian  too 
look  it was just
like it used to be 
it was better  actually 
everything that
i fell in love with
about paige
is still there 
you know  to you 
i m sure it seemed
like a confirmation
of your love
or your marriage  right 
but to her 
it probably seemed more
like a really good
first date 
exactly  which is why
i think you ve gotta wait
the requisite three days
before you call 
i gotta wait three days
to call after a date
with my own wife 
at least 
this is a unique case 
maybe longer 
it can t be longer 
i m gonna see her
on saturday at the wedding 
i m telling you 
it was so obvious 
even with all this crazy shit
going on around us 
we still belong together 
obvious to her
or to you 
to both of us 
  oh  oh  paige 
  yeah 
we have to start writing out
those place cards
after we eat 
yes 
before you start on that 
i have a little surprise
for you  paige 
oh 
you know ray porter 
right 
he taught constitutional law
at northwestern 
he and i were on
law review together 
we ve known each other
1 000 years 
he is the dean of
the law school now 
okay 
and they re gonna
let you back in 
what 
well   
i didn t even apply 
i took care of it 
this is crazy 
i feel like i m getting
a free do over in life 
you look like
you could use a drink 
i ve already had several 
but you haven t had this 
all right 
i m glad we re
having a moment alone 
i haven t gotten a chance
to really talk to you  leo 
yeah 
yeah  cool 
congratulations 
that s nice 
yes  it is 
i ve been thinking 
and i think that
it s probably time to
let us take it from here 
take what 
things with paige 
look  i know she didn t have
health insurance because
you chose to live
in a certain way 
and i know you must
be drowning in debt 
but i also know
a way out of this 
what s that 
divorce her 
the bills have
only just begun  leo 
mr  thornton  i don t think
this is the time
or the place to discuss this 
fine  if you don t care
about losing your business 
which  clearly  you don t 
what about paige 
what about doing
what is obviously
the right thing for her 
and you know
what s right for her 
as a matter of fact  i do 
you re such a hypocrite 
what did you say 
if you re such
a family man  how come i   
i never once saw
you come and try
to put things back
together with paige 
you re such a coward 
hey  can i introduce
you around a little bit 
can t feel good to
be the odd man out 
i m not the odd man out 
all right 
if you say so 
you just seem a little creepy
over here all by yourself 
i m just waiting
for paige  man 
all right  well 
best of luck with that 
you like this  right 
i m sorry  like what 
paige leaves you behind 
she goes and has
this life without you 
with some guy
that no one gets 
and now you get to
see her reject all that 
i mean  i like it
a little bit 
yeah 
well  let me
tell you what i like 
i like the fact
that paige told me
everything about you 
jeremy 
okay 
she told me that
when she was with you 
she would wake up
at night in a panic 
thinking 
 is this all there is  
wow 
she told you
everything  huh 
mmm hmm 
did she tell you
that she threw herself
at me the other day 
did she tell you that 
or did she stop
telling you everything
when she forgot
who the hell you were 
look  i get why
you re being such a dick 
you obviously love her 
and you think you re
gonna get her back 
but the thing is 
she outgrew you 
what makes you think
that won t happen again 
thank you for that advice 
i will mull it over while
i m in bed with your wife 
leo 
paige  wait 
what the hell
were you thinking 
i don t know  that s
a really good question 
because i have been
driving myself insane 
making a complete ass
of myself 
literally trying
everything possible
to try to save
what we have 
and you ve been
throwing yourself
at jeremy 
that s not fair 
it s not fair 
i see the way
you look at him 
i know 
because you used to
look at me that way 
leo  i   
no  i think we need to
start being realistic 
your memory s
not coming back 
the fact is that
i m still just a stranger 
i m not trying
to hurt you 
but i m just   
i m so tired of
disappointing you 
i know 
i m so sorry 
i ll apologize
to gwen and ryan 
oh  god  no  it s fine 
wedding disasters
have a way of turning
into great stories 
eventually 
how do you look at
the girl you love
and tell yourself
it s time to walk away 
leo 
i hope one day i can love
the way that you love me 
you figured it out once 
you ll do it again 
shit 
you re here  not there 
are you okay 
i m done 
it s over  i give up 
no  you never give up  leo 
no  if we were
meant to be together 
we would be together 
i was just thinking
about the first time
that we went to
that greek restaurant
on the corner 
there was
this big banner saying
 now serving soup  
and i just started to
go on and on
about all the obstacles
that the owner
must have overcome
to achieve his lifelong dream
of serving soup 
and then   
and when i was finished   
she didn t say anything
for a few seconds
and she just   
she just sort of exhaled it 
it was almost to herself 
 i love you  
and it just hung there 
it was the first time
she had said it 
and i didn t
even wanna respond 
i just wanted to
keep hearing it 
that was two weeks
after we met 
it only took her two weeks
to fall in love
with me before 
she doesn t love me 
sign here  please 
come here 
little buddy 
diane 
hey 
how are you 
listen   
i know it s been years 
i was away for a while 
i never had a chance
to apologize 
i was just going through
a really weird time 
but your dad ended it
as soon as your mother
confronted him about us 
and i just always
wanted you to know that 
i don t mean to
open old wounds  but   
i just really needed
to say that i m sorry 
no  i m really glad
that you said something 
you were always
a really good friend 
i just wish i could ve
returned the favor 
the lilies were bad 
so i got sunflowers instead 
i wanted to tell you 
you knew 
you knew the whole time 
i m sorry 
don t talk to me 
paige  paige  paige 
hey  where have you
been all day  stranger 
hmm 
paige 
i ran into diane chain
at the store 
that s why i left  isn t it 
because i found out 
mom  i barely
even know who i am 
and then it turns out
you re lying to me 
and you ve used my accident
to rewrite the past 
i couldn t bear the thought
of losing you again 
do you have any idea
how betrayed i feel
right now 
i m sorry  paige 
we were happier than
we d been in years 
oh  mom 
we finally
had you back again 
back on your terms 
no 
yes  as usual 
paige 
he cheated on you
with my friend 
how could you
stay with him 
i   
i was going to leave 
i was 
i was all ready to leave 
and then one afternoon 
i was all alone
in the house 
and i started looking at
all the photographs of you
and your   
and your sister 
and the house seemed
so full of all of us 
we were a family  paige 
and i realized
in that moment that
that was
the most important thing
in the world for me 
and i couldn t 
i couldn t 
i could not go 
so  you just
wasped it away 
no 
i chose to stay with him
for all the things
that he had done right
and not to leave him
for the one thing
that he had done wrong 
i chose to forgive him 
maybe leo was right 
maybe i can t
figure out who i am
and be around all of you 
i still feel
a little chilly  i don t
care what you say 
that s fine 
paige 
i m sorry 
is everything okay 
look  you two
obviously need to talk 
so i m just   
okay 
talk to you later 
all right  bye 
i m    i m sorry 
what happened 
can i ask you something 
yeah 
you can always
ask me anything 
did you know
about my dad s affair 
yeah 
i knew 
why didn t you tell me 
there were so many times
that i almost did 
but to drive you away
from your family again 
that just felt wrong 
i wanted your love  i   
just not like that 
i wanted to earn it 
i just don t think
i can afford to
lose them right now 
so don t 
certain parties
have sought to nullify
various congressional acts 
claiming that
repeated extensions
of copyright protection
constitute
a perpetual copyright
of the sort the drafters
of the constitution
would have rejected 
the united states
supreme court 
in the 2003 case
of eldred v  ashcroft   
thanks for lunch 
actually  there s something
that i wanted to tell you 
okay 
things are over
with rose 
i ended it  paige 
no  why did you do that 
i thought you were
getting engaged   
we were 
but that was before you 
no  that was after me 
okay  it was after you 
but it was before this you 
it was before
the old you came back 
jeremy  i m not the old me 
i m just me 
i m just the me that s trying
to figure it out still 
i understand 
but  whichever it is 
the old you or the new you 
i don t care 
i know you remember
what we were like together 
i know you do 
this is our chance
to get that back 
what we had was wonderful 
those were wonderful memories 
but those were   
those are my only memories 
everything
after you is erased 
i   
i have to discover
what it s like to be
without you  on my own 
are you sure
you don t remember
breaking up with me
the first time 
why 
 cause it sounded
a hell of a lot like that 
let s go 
hey 
i was looking all over 
i was worried
when i didn t see you
outside the library 
so   
how s that intellectual
property class going 
actually  i wanna
talk to you about that 
i ve decided to
leave law school 
and i m gonna get
an apartment in the city 
it s happening
all over again  isn t it 
damn it  paige 
i ve made a lot
of mistakes 
dad  this isn t about you
or anything you ve done 
this is about me 
who i want to be  who i am 
just tell me what to say 
so i don t lose you again 
you won t 
a moment of impact 
a moment of impact
whose potential for change
has ripple effects
far beyond what
we can predict 
sending some particles
crashing together
making them
closer than before 
while sending
others spinning off
into great ventures
landing where
you never thought
you d find them 
you see  that s the thing
about moments like these 
you can t 
no matter how hard you try 
control how
they re gonna affect you 
you just gotta let
the colliding particles
land where they may
and wait until
the next collision 
i vow to
help you love life 
to always hold you
with tenderness 
and to have the patience
that love demands 
to speak when
words are needed
and to share the silence
when they re not 
to agree to disagree
on red velvet cake 
and to live within
the warmth of your heart
and always call it home 
hi 
hi 
i hope you didn t
come all the way
into the city
for hot chocolate 
actually  i moved
back here six months ago 
i m over in rogers park 
really  that   
that s great 
i m actually back
at the art institute 
what 
are you kidding me 
mmm mmm 
that s amazing 
yeah  i mean 
i m sitting in
on a few classes 
and it s crazy
what my hands remember
that my  you know 
that my mind forgot 
yeah 
so  thank you 
i didn t do anything 
you did everything 
you accepted me for who i am 
and not for
what you wanted me to be 
i just wanted you
to be happy 
that s all 
isn t there some
cuban place around here
where we used to go
when this place was closed 
yeah  it s    wait 
you remember 
no  no 
i wish 
no  the memory stuff
hasn t come back  but i ve   
sonia and i have been
hanging out a little bit 
and i ve been
asking her about us 
really 
and what has she been saying 
that she doesn t think you re
seeing anyone right now 
she just happens
to be right 
you  are you seeing anyone 
that s good 
so  do you wanna go
to the cuban place 
with me 
okay 
okay 
what would you say
to trying someplace
that we haven t
been to before 
someplace new 
i d like that 
after you 
  i ve been looking so long
at these pictures of you
  that i almost believe
that they re real
  i ve been living so long
with my pictures of you
  that i almost believe
  that the pictures are
  all i can feel
  remembering you
standing quiet in the rain
  as i ran to your heart
to be near
  and we kissed
as the sky fell in
  holding you close
  how i always held close
in your fear
  remembering you
running soft through the night
  you were bigger and brighter
and wider than snow
  and screamed
at the make believe
  screamed at the sky
  and you finally found
all your courage
  to let it all go
  remembering you
fallen into my arms
  crying for the death
of your heart
  you were stone white
so delicate
  lost in the cold
  you were always
so lost in the dark
  remembering you
how you used to be
  slow drowned
you were angels
  so much more
than everything
  hold for the last time
then slip away quietly
  open my eyes
but i never see anything
  if only i d thought
of the right words
  i could have held on
to your heart
  if only i d thought
of the right words
  i wouldn t be
breaking apart
  all my pictures of you
  looking so long
at these pictures of you
  but i never hold on
to your heart
  there was nothing
in the world
  that i ever wanted more
  than to feel you
deep in my heart
  there was nothing
