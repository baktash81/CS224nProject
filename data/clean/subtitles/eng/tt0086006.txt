 y bi   nights could be long and sweet
 y bi   the message is clear
 y bi   like nothing i ve ever known
 y bi   but from all that i hear
 y bi   forget about long range plans
 y bi   cos this man s got his own
 y bi   to get mixed up with
 y bi a man who says never
 y bi   may be big trouble  but then
 y bi   i just could be the woman to take you
 y bi   and make you never say never again
 y bi   never  never say never again
 y bi   never  never say never again
 y bi   never  never say never again
 y bi   never  never say never again
 y bi   you ve got all the moves
 y bi   ah  but baby i got  em too
 y bi   no matter your attitude or your mood
 y bi   i ll come through
 y bi   the touch of your voice
 y bi   the feel of your eyes on me
 y bi   you leave me no choice
 y bi   though i know there s danger there
 y bi   i don t care  let it be
 y bi   to get in bed with
 y bi a man who says never
 y bi   may have no future  but then
 y bi   i just could be the woman to reach you
 y bi   and teach you to never say never again
 y bi   i ll bet you  i ll get you
 y bi   i ll reach you  i ll teach you
 y bi   i ll take you  i ll make you
one minute  47 seconds  sir 
  not too shabby  sir 
  but dead  007  dead 
you should have studied
the plot more carefully 
fanatical revolutionaries
kidnap a millionaire s daughter 
of course she could have been
brainwashed  could have turned 
  evidently she did 
  with due respect  sir 
i played for two weeks
and i only got killed once 
twice  the land mine
on the black sea beach 
correction  sir 
i lost both legs  i did not die 
you were immobilised 
it can never be the same
playing with blanks 
it is somewhat different in the field 
with your life on the line  you   
well  your adrenaline gives you an edge 
is your edge sharp  that s the difference
between a double 0 and a corpse 
since you took over  sir 
you ve had little use for the double 0s 
i ve spent most of my time teaching 
  not doing 
  oh  i ll make you no secret 
i hold your methods in much less regard
than my illustrious predecessor did 
but my duty is to keep you up to par 
too many free radicals 
that s your problem 
  free radicals  sir 
  toxins that destroy the body and brain 
caused by eating too much red meat and
white bread  and too many dry martinis 
  then i shall cut out the white bread  sir 
  you ll do more than that  007 
from now on  you will be suffering
a strict regimen of diet and exercise 
we shall purge those toxins from you 
  shrublands 
  you ve got it 
  have you got an assignment  james 
  yes  yes  moneypenny 
i m to eliminate all free radicals 
do be careful 
  welcome to shrublands  sir 
  thank you 
my word  they don t make them
like this any more 
  it s still in pretty good shape 
  this way  sir 
your body s got enough
scar tissue for an entire regiment 
  right    but it s still in pretty good shape 
  we ll be the judge of that  mr bond 
our job is not just to rehabilitate you 
it s to re educate you 
i want to open your mind to the virtues
of nutrition  proper exercise  meditation
and  hopefully  spiritual enlightenment 
i d like you to see the iridologist at four 
have a colonic at five
and then you can cut along to the
light dining room for a cup of parsley tea 
mr bond  i need a urine sample 
if you could fill this beaker for me   
from here 
 y bi bonjour 
  box 274 and quickly  please 
 y bi   ah  oui  suivez moi 
we have invested extensively in
the middle east and central america
to promote insurgency and revolution 
fortunately our capital outlay
has been handsomely offset
by the resultant sales
of armaments and missiles 
you will note that we have supplied
both rebels and government forces
on an equal basis 
in matters of death 
spectre is strictly impartial 
now for the future  spectre s
most audacious enterprise of any 
next to which our previous
ventures are inconsequential 
our esteemed number one is in
complete charge of the entire operation 
which will henceforth
be called  the tears of allah  
he will now join us 
according to plans 
an american air force officer
has been introduced
to a cruel mistress  heroin 
i understand he is now
our willing and obedient servant 
 y bi a surgical operation
 y bi has been performed on him 
 y bi as a result of a corneal implant 
 y bi his right eye print is an exact replica of
 y bi that of the president of the united states 
 y bi he will soon be moved to
 y bi a convalescent clinic near london 
 y bi i have chosen number 12
 y bi to have the responsibility
 y bi of taking the most tenderloving care
 y bi of captain jack petachi 
i beg your pardon 
is there no speed limit here 
she s not staff  she must be
one of those private nurses 
my name is bond 
oh  you re mr bond

ok  now just relax 
yes  there are slight lesions
of the thoracic vertebrae 
now  if you just hold still   
yes  some sacroiliac strain
at the base of the spine 
there is a more beneficial
therapy for a man s lower back 
  oh  really 
  mm 
and what might that be 
i thought i d    surprise you  james 
well  you have  come in 
no  no  i can t come in  you know if they
found me here they d fire me on the spot 
i won t let anyone find you  don t worry 
i have my reputation to think of 
i don t think you got your reputation
by living on a diet of wild rice  so   
lentil delight  dandelion salad 
goat s cheese 
beluga caviar  quail s eggs  vodka 
foie gras 
strasbourg 
 y bi in question time
 y bi at the house of commons 
 y bi the minister said that local authorities
 y bi should be given far wider   
jack s been smoking again 
jack was ordered not to smoke 
smoking is dirty 
it gets into jack s eye 
jack must do as he s told if he wants
his fast cars and his pretty clothes 
  and if he wants to keep his sister alive   
  you leave domino out of this 
mmm  james

good morning  mr bond  miss fearing

oh  yes 
but i must say  you re looking
a bit peaked this morning 
  i was up all night 
  don t overdo it 
a herbal enema should fix you up 
thank you    sounds terrific 
i ll be done in a minute 
heavy  mr bond 
let s try again 
 y bi through the defensive walls   
 y bi he shoots    it s there 
you lunatics 
i send you to a health farm to get yourself
in shape  instead you demolish it 
i ve had to notify the local police  pull out
the special branch  muzzle the press
and allocate a large chunk of my meagre
budget to renovating the establishment 
  a man did try to kill me  sir 
  caught you seducing his wife  did he 
no  sir  not at all  but i lost four pounds
and god knows how many free radicals 
that is the kind of attitude
that tempts me to suspend you  007 
this test assesses distance and accuracy
of cruise missile release
from the support country 
these alcms  with dummy warheads 
will go from terrain following to inertial
guidance  over water  toward the target 
  we hope 
 y bi   stand by 
 y bi countdown is go for dummy warhead
 y bi loading and b 1 flight 
 y bi let s hope we never
 y bi have to use the real thing 
all right  men  this is it 
let s make it a good one 
 y bi mr president  please stand by
 y bi while authority for this procedure
 y bi is confirmed by eye print check 
 y bi if confirmation is not authenticated within
 y bi eight seconds  the base will be sealed 
 y bi eight    seven   
 y bi   six    five   
  come on 
 y bi   four    three    two   
  come on 
 y bi one  thank you 
 y bi presidential authority is confirmed
 y bi for change of test procedure 
 y bi dummy warheads will be replaced
 y bi by w 80 thermonuclear device 
 y bi have a nice day 
jack 
bravo 
no  no 
ooh  my poor angel 
my sweet baby 
mr kovacs  how much longer 
they re coming  they re almost in range 
 y bi safety officer to base  radar confirms
 y bi both missiles on descent trajectory 
what the hell s going on here 
they ve got maximum thrust 
 y bi about to cross minimum cruise height 
 y bi   descending below minimum height   
  damn  we ve lost  em 
we ve got them 
 y bi   well  kovacs 
  the fish are netted 
put them on ice 
i am supreme commander of spectre 
the special executive
for counterintelligence 
terrorism  revenge and extortion 
 y bi yesterday morning the american air force
 y bi launched two cruise missiles
 y bi from swadley airbase in great britain 
 y bi through the ingenuity of spectre 
 y bi the dummy warheads they carried
 y bi were replaced with
 y bi live nuclear warheads 
 y bi your weapons of destruction
 y bi are now safely in our possession
 y bi and will be moved to two secret targets 
 y bi please note the serial numbers of
 y bi the missiles  they will confirm the truth 
 y bi your weapons of deterrence
 y bi did not deter us from our objective 
 y bi a terrible catastrophe now confronts you 
 y bi however  it can be avoided by
 y bi paying a tribute to our organisation 
 y bi amounting to 25  of your respective
 y bi countries  annual oil purchases 
 y bi we have accomplished two of the
 y bi functions the name spectre embodies 
 y bi terror and extortion 
 y bi if our demands are not met within seven
 y bi days  we shall ruthlessly deploy the third 
 y bi revenge 
that would be  25 billion a year 
order 
this would destabilise
the monetary system 
i call this meeting to order 
the foreign secretary wishes
to address you  lord ambrose 
gentlemen  we are faced
with the ultimate nightmare 
the abduction of nuclear warheads 
but how is this possible 
up to now  our procedures
relating to nuclear hardware
have been absolutely foolproof 
i hope the american government realises
its awesome responsibility in this matter 
nato has a joint responsibility
to solve this problem 
but if this gets out 
it will cause worldwide panic 
how well has this information
been contained 
apart from those present in this room 
the information resides only with
the cia and british lntelligence 
wonderful  that means
by now it s all over the kremlin 
i know your feelings  m 
but i insist you reactivate the double 0s 
as you wish  sir 
 y bi maximillian largo  born bucharest  1945 
 y bi industrialist and philanthropist 
 y bi resident nassau  bahamas 
 y bi no known criminal associations 
you still here  moneypenny 
you should be in bed 
james  we both should be 
instead i m looking everywhere for you 
forget that  m wants to see you right now 
it s panic stations upstairs 
he s been with the prime minister all day 
i think you re back in business  james 
  morning  gentlemen 
  morning 
  the latest reports  everything ok 
  yes  sir 
  morning 
  morning  charles 
in secret  the americans are
trying to trace the missile
on their eastern seaboard 
the other allegedly threatens
the oilfields of the middle east 
how well protected are they from the air 
everyone s collaborating 
the americans  nato  the japanese   
they re putting up an air screen
a mosquito couldn t get through 
our concern is that the warhead
may already be in position 
the worst devastation would result
from a subterranean explosion 
you see  the oil bearing strata
in the area   
interconnected by
a surprisingly delicate structure 
it would be a sort of ripple effect 
what s the americans  story
on how the damn things were stolen 
the release of alcms
has to come from the president 
even that has safeguards  it can only be
authorised after a scan of his right eye 
the only irregularity is that
a communications officer
unofficially left the base at the time
of launch  a certain captain jack petachi 
if this petachi was involved 
is it conceivable that
he could have used a false eye 
oh  do come along  bond 
let s think of a more
logical explanation  shall we 
 y bi ok  let s run through
 y bi that routine from yesterday 
  let s go again 
  ok 
four  five  six  seven  down 
max 
as usual  i have left you
alone too long  i know 
but i brought you a gift 
i don t want any more gifts 
i just want you  that s all i want 
i know  but this is different 
  look  look 
  oh  max 
  what is it 
  it s very old 
oh 
  what s the inscription 
  arabic   the tears of allah  
the story is that the prophet wept
for the barrenness of the desert
  and his tears made a well 
  mmm 
it s a legend  of course 
but like all great legends 
it is also the truth 
it is the most valuable thing   
i have ever possessed 
except you 
hmmm 
  and you trust me to wear it 
  a safer place i couldn t imagine 
and what if i ever leave you 
no  really 
then i cut your throat 
nice to know even old q can surprise
one of you double 0s occasionally 
algernon 
not quite perfected yet 
you could write a very
binding contract with this 
yeah  i wish i had a new contract 
they ve slashed my budget 
you can t get the spare parts  and when
you can  some strike stops delivery 
and look at this place 
they keep it bloody freezing down here 
plays havoc with my sinuses 
we re both humble servants of the crown 
if the cia made me an offer 
i d be off like a shot 
unlimited resources  air conditioning 
28 flavours of ice cream in the restaurant 
it s a motorbike toy  if i can get the thing
to work properly  i ll ship it out to you 
wait a minute  i ve got something
in here that could be useful 
the prototype came from a kgb defector 
bit of a whiz kid in their technical section 
not a bad chap  though like
all defectors  prone to melancholy 
i suppose it s all that vodka
and english weather 
ah 
rather tasty  this is 
it looks like a watch  but it s really a laser 
  keeps perfect time 
  but for how long 
at least your lifetime 
good to see you  mr bond 
things have been awfully dull round here 
bureaucrats running the place 
things done by the book 
can t make a decision unless
the computer gives you the go ahead 
now you re on this  i hope we re going to
have some gratuitous sex and violence 
i certainly hope so too  what is this for 
i ll show you  you unscrew it 
then stick it up your nose 
  it s for my sinus 
  well  i won t need one where i m going 
where s that 
or are you not allowed to say 
  the bahamas 
  lucky bloody you 
  oh  sorry 
  that s perfectly all right 
  what are you hoping to catch 
  something about 6 2   190lb 
  with brown eyes 
  well  why bother going to sea 
  let me help you 
  mr bond 
  i say  mr bond 
  catch you later  perhaps 
right 
nigel small fawcett 
british embassy  nassau 
  how do you do  nigel 
  sorry i m late 
as you re an undercover johnny  i took
the precaution of not being followed 
that s why you shouted
my name across the harbour 
oh  god  did l  oh  i m sorry 
damn  damn 
sorry  i m rather new to all this 
  what s the score with largo 
  he s highly visible here 
enormously wealthy 
owns the biggest boat in the caribbean 
spends a lot of his time
at a place called bluebeard reef 
marine archaeology  i gather 
  you ve met him 
  oh  yes  he s charming 
i mean    foreign 
but charming nonetheless 
he donates a lot of money to worthy
causes  he built a maritime museum
  and a new wing for the orphanage 
  i m sure he s very kind to his mother 
don t know his mother 
you re not going to make
any trouble  are you 
let s face it 
your reputation has preceded you 
  do i look like i would make trouble 
  well  yes  frankly 
you ll jeopardise the tourist trade
if you go around killing people 
nigel  please  just go back to your desk 
find out where largo s boat is at the
moment  call me later  i ll be at my hotel 
jolly good  i ll get onto that at once 
and take full advantage
of the natural cover

 y bi   oui  mademoiselle 
 y bi monsieur 
wait a minute  you there 
i shouldn t have the fish 
you must have an unreasonable fear of
gatecrashers to carry this heavy artillery 
this bomb has a tiny gyroscope inside 
any lateral movement on your part
and you could be served in an egg cup 
if you understand what s being
explained to you  nod gently 
good boy  stay 
hello again  i do owe you an explanation 
my name is bond  james bond 
may i offer you a drink 
  hard or soft 
  soft 
a double bloody mary with
plenty of worcestershire sauce 
i hate to think what you mean
by hard  vodka on the rocks 
i think you have lost her 
do you imagine that i could lose a woman
to an underpaid british agent  ja 
ja  and i warn you 
if he s not executed at once 
he ll have your domino turned over 
is it possible that you have bungled
your attempts because you want him   
for yourself  hm 
maximillian  why torture yourself
over that kind of woman 
maybe one day
you have to kill her  fatima 
your sense of humour is delicious 
what s your brother up to these days 
he s on his way here 
oh  i can t wait to see him 
  how do you know my brother 
  hello 
you must be mr james bond  right 
monsieur largo 
yes  right 
are you a man who enjoys games 
it depends with whom i m playing 
ja  shall we 
join us 
these are my friends  they honoured me
by coming from all over the world
to give money to my favourite charity 
  and what might that be 
  orphan children 
so    here we are 
the game is called domination 
i designed it myself 
but my problem is  i ve never
yet found a worthy adversary 
no doubt i shall disappoint you too 
we ll see 
darling 
this game has one objective  power 
we will be fighting for countries 
chosen at random by the machine 
but for this demonstration
i will choose france 
target areas will light up on the map 
whoever hits them first with
his laser beam will score points 
but there is another way to win 
with the left hand 
you control two nuclear missiles 
with the right hand  you control
a shield to block my missiles 
but if you fail    boom  i win the game 
you will be red  i will be blue 
are you ready 
yes 
begin 
 y bi thank you  gentlemen  eternal battle
 y bi for the domination of the world begins 
  we play for dollars 
 y bi   random target selection  spain 
 y bi value   9 000 
 y bi play 
 y bi blue wins  9 000 
  it gave me a shock 
  oh  i m sorry  i forgot 
unlike armchair generals 
we will share the pain of our soldiers 
in the form of electric shocks 
one last point  if you let go
of the controls  you forfeit the game 
as you were unaware of this 
we will begin again 
 y bi reset  thank you 
 y bi random target selection  japan 
 y bi value   16 000 
 y bi   play 
  excuse me  excuse me 
 y bi blue wins  16 000 
a lucky move on my part 
perhaps i didn t explain 
as the stakes increase 
so does the level of pain 
rather like life  we continue 
of course 
good 
 y bi eternal battle for
 y bi the domination of the world begins 
 y bi random target selection

but i m going to need your help 
  what do you want me to do 
  i m going to kiss you 
i want you to respond as if you liked it 
i m doing this for two very good reasons 
one  because i m hoping
to provoke a reaction 
and the other one 
because i always wanted to 
 y bi false alarm  false alarm 
 y bi all crew return to stations 
we ve had a message from one of our
ships in the med  i think it s from bond 
  about time

so   
 y bi ciao  bello 
  largo 
  bond 
in that case 
where did you hide the bombs 
you still think of escape 
i must say  i admire your spirit 
well   
bomb number one is
right under the president s feet   
in washington dc 
and number two 
you were a very good secret agent 
really 
bye 
i m sure this will amuse you 
goodbye  domino 
cover it up 
  hold on 
  whoa  what are you doing 
james 
  you re a hard man to keep up with 
  clear the line to washington  felix 
that s where the first bomb is 
it was never like this
when i was in the navy 
here we are 
what s the matter 
you re going back after largo  aren t you 
well  i have to 
i want him as much as you do 
probably more 
i can understand you hating him 
well  maybe    maybe i don t hate him
enough to risk losing you 
but i don t want to risk losing me  either 
 y bi commander bond 
 y bi the washington bomb has been defused 
 y bi now  sir  from london 
 y bi your chief wants to speak to you 
 y bi this is m  we ve cracked the code
 y bi for disarming the warheads 
 y bi but we ve only got five hours
 y bi to find the second bomb 
 y bi now  as you perfectly well know 
 y bi i have absolute confidence in you  and i   
  that s what kept me going  sir 
 y bi   all right  then  i ll be brief with you 
 y bi i know you ve got your hands full 
 y bi if you should come through
 y bi this fearful ordeal unscathed 
 y bi i d like to offer you
 y bi lunch at my club  over 
that s a thrilling prospect  sir 
but if i do get through this 
i may have other plans 
  steady at 300 
  steady at 300 
there she is  sir 
  what s she reading 
  seven fathoms  sir 
no way we can get in there 
the water s too shallow 
nothing  nothing moving on board 
awac surveillance reports
no sightings on shore 
now why did largo anchor here 
your pendant  give it to me 
this is  the tears of allah  
the story goes that the prophet wept
and his tears made a well 
the contours are the same 
the diamond must mark a place 
that would be about here 
right where the oilfields begin 
sir  there is underwater
activity in the area 
check the area for underwater caves 
sonar signals do indicate a cavity
below sea level at 015 degrees 
there s an underground river there 
commander pederson 
are you equipped with the new xt 7bs 
that s top secret 
how do you know about them 
from a russian translation
of one of your service manuals 
sorry about that 
 y bi ports open 
 y bi fire one 
 y bi fire two 
 y bi cut track 
be careful of the housing 
watch it 
i ve got to go in 
we don t have much time 
give the sub our position
and get some help 
kovacs  kovacs  come 
here  look 
well done  dr kovacs 
 y bi go ahead  go ahead 
when the warhead is ready for
its final voyage  we will drink a toast 
there is nothing
that can stop us any more 
the guide rope  keep the tension 
the tears of allah 
sweet  like money 
for years  it has been
a monument to power 
but nothing like what we
now possess  huh  kovacs 
everybody stay undercover 
you  get up there 
leiter  stay down 
what took you so long  hold up on
the heavy stuff  bond is still in there 
it s armed 
largo got away with the warhead 
call down a chopper 
i m going to try the oasis  good luck 
bond s clear  we re movin  in 
ah  there you are 
i always have a martini at five 
you ll never give up
your old habits  james 
no  you re wrong  those days are over 
ah 
oh  no 
i m sorry  mr bond 
obviously caught you at a bad moment 
  m sent you 
  only to plead for your return  sir 
m says without you in the service
he fears for the security
of the civilised world 
  never again 
  never 
 y bi   never  never say never again
 y bi   never  never say never again
 y bi   you walk in a room
 y bi   a woman can feel the heat
 y bi   one look is a guarantee
 y bi   nights could be long and sweet
 y bi   the message is clear
 y bi   like nothing i ve ever known
 y bi   but from all that i hear
 y bi   forget about long range plans
 y bi   cos this man s got his own
 y bi   to get mixed up with
 y bi a man who says never
 y bi   may be big trouble  but then
 y bi   i just could be the woman to take you
 y bi   and make you never say never again
 y bi   never  never say never again
 y bi   never  never say never again
 y bi   never  never say never again
 y bi   never  never say never again
 y bi   you ve got all the moves
 y bi   ah  but baby i got  em too
 y bi   no matter your attitude or your mood
 y bi   i ll come through
 y bi   the touch of your voice
 y bi   the feel of your eyes on me
 y bi   you leave me no choice
 y bi   though i know there s danger there
 y bi   i don t care  let it be
 y bi   to get in bed with
 y bi a man who says never
 y bi   may have no future  but then
 y bi   i just could be the woman to reach you
