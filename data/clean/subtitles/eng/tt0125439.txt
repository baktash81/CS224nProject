      piano  
    man continues  indistinct  
 9 
  she may be the face
i can t forget  
 10 
  a trace of pleasure or regret  
 11 
  may be my treasure or the price  
 12 
  i have to pay  
 13 
  she may be the mirror  
 14 
  of my dream  
 15 
  a smile reflected in a stream  
 16 
  she may not be what she may seem  
 17 
  inside her shell  
 18 
  she who always seems
so happy in a crowd  
 19 
  whose eyes can be
so private and so proud  
 20 
  no one s allowed
to see them when they cry  
 21 
  she may be the love
that cannot hope to last  
 22 
  may come to me
from shadows of the past  
 23 
  that i ll remember till the day  
 24 
  i die  
 25 
  she may be the reason i survive  
 26 
  the why and wherefore i m alive  
 27 
  the one i ll care for
through the rough  
 28 
  and ready years  
 29 
  me  i ll take her laughter
and her tears  
 30 
  and make them all my souvenirs  
 31 
  for where she goes i ve got to be  
 32 
  the meaning of my life is  
 33 
  she  
 34 
  she  
 35 
  oh  she  
 36 
  man narrating  
of course i ve seen her films   
 37 
  man narrating  
of course i ve seen her films   
 38 
and always thought
she was  well  fabulous 
 39 
but  you know  a million  million miles
from the world i live in   
 40 
which is here  notting hill 
my favorite bit of london 
 41 
there s the market on weekdays selling
every fruit and vegetable known to man 
 42 
rock hard bananas 
five for a pound 
 43 
the tattoo parlor
with a guy outside who got drunk   
 44 
and now can t remember
why he chose  i love ken  
 45 
the radical hairdressers
where everyone comes out
looking like the cookie monster 
 46 
whether they want to or not 
 47 
and then  suddenly 
it s the weekend 
 48 
and from break of day hundreds
of stalls appear out of nowhere 
 49 
filling portobello road 
right up to notting hill gate 
 50 
and wherever you look thousands of
people are buying millions of antiques 
 51 
some genuine and some   
not quite so genuine 
 52 
and what s great is that lots of friends
have ended up in this part of london 
 53 
that s tony  for example 
architect turned chef 
 54 
who recently invested all the money
he ever earned in a new restaurant 
 55 
and so  this is where
i spend my days and years   
 56 
in this small village in the middle of
the city in a house with a blue door   
 57 
that my wife and i bought together
before she left me for a man   
 58 
who looked exactly like harrison ford 
 59 
and where i lead a strange half life
with a lodger called  
 60 
spike 
 61 
you couldn t help me with an incredible
important decision  could you 
 62 
is this important in comparison to 
let s say  whether they should cancel
third world debt 
 63 
that s right  i am at last going out
on a date with the great janine 
 64 
and i just wanna be sure
i ve picked the right t shirt 
 65 
  what are the choices 
  well  wait for it 
 66 
first there s this one 
  growls   cool  huh 
 67 
yeah  it might make it hard
to strike a really romantic note 
 68 
point taken 
don t despair 
 69 
if it s romance we re looking for 
i believe i have just the thing 
 70 
yeah  well  there again  she might not
think you had true love on your mind 
 71 
right 
just one more 
 72 
true love here i come 
 73 
well  yeah  yeah  that s  
that s  um  perfect 
 74 
great  thanks 
 75 
  wish me luck 
  good luck 
 76 
  narrating   and so it was
just another hopeless wednesday 
 77 
as i walked the thousand yards
through the market to work 
 78 
never suspecting that this was the day
that was gonna change my life forever 
 79 
this is work  by the way 
my little travel bookshop 
 80 
  morning  martin 
  morning  monsignor 
 81 
which  um  well  sells travel books 
 82 
and to be frank with you 
doesn t always sell many of those 
 83 
classic 
profit from major sales push 
 84 
minus 347 pounds 
 85 
shall l  uh 
go and get you a cappuccino 
 86 
  you know  ease the pain a bit 
  yeah  yeah 
 87 
better make it a half 
all i can afford 
 88 
get your logic 
demi cappu coming right up 
 89 
  doorbell dings  
 90 
um  can i help you at all 
 91 
no  thanks 
i ll just    look around 
 92 
fine 
 93 
uh  that book s really not great 
 94 
just in case  you know  browsing turned
to buying  you d be wasting your money 
 95 
but if it s turkey
you re interested in 
 96 
um  this one  on the other hand 
is very good 
 97 
um  i think the man who wrote it has
actually been to turkey  which helps 
 98 
um  there s also
a very amusing incident with a kebab 
 99 
um  which is one
of many amusing incidents 
 100 
thanks 
i ll think about it 
 101 
or  in the bigger hardback variety 
there s  
 102 
i m sorry 
can you just give me a second 
 103 
excuse me 
 104 
  yes 
  bad news 
 105 
what 
 106 
we ve got a security camera
in this bit of the shop 
 107 
so 
 108 
so i saw you put that book
down your trousers 
 109 
  what book 
  the one down your trousers 
 110 
i don t have a book
down my trousers 
 111 
right 
 112 
i tell you what 
um  i ll call the police  and  um 
 113 
if i m wrong about the whole
 book down the trousers  scenario 
 114 
i really apologize 
 115 
okay  what if    i did
have a book down my trousers 
 116 
well  ideally 
when i went back to the desk 
 117 
you d remove the cadogan guide
to bali from your trousers   
 118 
and either wipe it
and put it back or buy it 
 119 
i ll see you in a sec 
 120 
i m sorry about that 
 121 
no  it s fine 
 122 
i was gonna steal one 
but now i ve changed my mind 
 123 
oh  signed by the author 
i see 
 124 
um  yeah  couldn t stop him 
 125 
if you can find an unsigned one 
it s worth an absolute fortune 
 126 
    chuckles  
  excuse me 
 127 
  yes 
  can i have your autograph 
 128 
uh  sure 
 129 
  uh  
  here 
 130 
  what s your name 
  rufus 
 131 
what does it say 
 132 
that s my signature  and above it  it
says   dear rufus  you belong in jail  
 133 
good one 
 134 
  do you want my phone number 
  tempting 
 135 
but    no 
thank you 
 136 
i will take this one 
 137 
oh  right  right 
so  uh  
 138 
well  on second thoughts 
um  maybe it s not that bad after all 
 139 
actually  it s a sort
of a classic  really 
 140 
none of those childish kebab stories
you find in so many books these days 
 141 
and  um  i tell you what 
 142 
i ll throw in
one of those for free 
 143 
useful for  uh  lighting fires 
 144 
wrapping fish 
that sort of thing 
 145 
  thanks 
  pleasure 
 146 
  door closes  
 147 
cappuccino  as ordered 
 148 
thanks 
 149 
i don t think you ll believe
who was just in here 
 150 
who 
was it someone famous 
 151 
  no  no  no 
  no 
 152 
would be exciting  though 
wouldn t it  if someone famous
came into the shop  hmm 
 153 
do you know  
and this is pretty amazing  actually  
 154 
but i once saw ringo starr 
 155 
  where was that 
  kensington high street 
 156 
at least i think it was ringo 
 157 
it might have been that man
from fiddler on the roof 
 158 
  you know  toppy 
  topol 
 159 
yes  that s right 
topol 
 160 
mm hmm 
 161 
actually  ringo starr doesn t  
doesn t look at all like  uh  topol 
 162 
yeah  but he was  
he was quite a long way away from me 
 163 
so actually it could ve
been neither of them 
 164 
yes  i suppose so  yes 
 165 
  it s not a classic anecdote  is it 
  not a classic  no  no 
 166 
  another one 
    sighs   yes  no 
 167 
let s go crazy 
i ll have an orange juice 
 168 
  people chattering  
 169 
  okay  thanks  bye bye 
  see you later 
 170 
  oh 
  oh  shit 
 171 
  oh  my god 
  bugger  i m so sorry  i m so sorry 
 172 
  here  let me  
  get your hands off 
 173 
i m really sorry 
i   i live just over the street 
 174 
i have  um  water and soap 
you can get cleaned up 
 175 
no  thank you 
i just need to get my car back 
 176 
i also have a phone 
i m confident that in five minutes   
 177 
we could have you spick and span
and back on the street again 
 178 
in the non prostitute sense 
obviously 
 179 
all right  well   what do you mean 
 just over the street  
 180 
  give it to me in yards 
  uh  18 yards 
 181 
  give it to me in yards 
  uh  18 yards 
 182 
that s my house there
with the blue front door 
 183 
come on in 
i ll just   i ll just  
 184 
um  right  right 
come in 
 185 
it s  um  not quite as tidy
as it normally is  i fear 
 186 
but  um  
the bathroom s on the top floor 
 187 
and the telephone s just  
just up here 
 188 
here 
let   let me  um  
 189 
um  round the corner 
straight on   straight on up 
 190 
bugger 
 191 
  groans  
 192 
uh oh 
 193 
uh 
 194 
would you like a cup of tea
before you go 
 195 
  no 
  coffee 
 196 
  no 
  orange juice 
 197 
probably not 
um  something else cold 
 198 
uh  
 199 
    bottles rattling  
  coke  water 
 200 
some disgusting sugary drink   
 201 
pretending to have something to do
with fruits of the forest 
 202 
  no 
  would you like something to eat 
 203 
uh  something to nibble 
 204 
um  apricots soaked in honey 
 205 
quite why  no one knows  because
it stops them tasting of apricots   
 206 
and makes them taste like honey 
 207 
and if you wanted honey  you d just
buy honey instead of    apricots 
 208 
um  but nevertheless 
there we go there 
 209 
they re yours if you want them 
 210 
no 
 211 
do you always say  no 
to everything 
 212

 215

that terrible book 
 219 
you re certainly not going
to be coming back to the shop 
 220 
thank you 
 221 
yeah

 222

 223 
it was nice to meet you

 225

  people chattering outside  
 227

 233 
  disaster 
  that s okay 
 234 
i thought the apricot and honey thing

 235 
    chuckles  
    doorknob rattling  
 236 
oh  my god 
my flatmate 
 237

to the size of raisins 
 242

not to tell anyone about this 
 243

no one 
 244 
i mean  i ll tell myself sometimes 
 245 
but don t worry 
i won t believe it 
 246

 273 
      continues  
  hey 
 274 
hi 
 275 
    once in a lifetime  
  just  um  incidentally 
 276 
uh  why   
are you wearing that 
 277 
combination of factors really 
uh  no clean clothes 
 278 
there never will be  you know 
unless you actually clean your clothes 
 279 
right 
vicious circle 
 280 
and i was  like 
rooting around in your things   
 281 
and i found this 
and i thought  cool  
 282 
kinda    spacey 
 283 
there s something wrong
with the goggles  though 
 284 
no  they were  um  prescription 
 285 
 groovy 
 so i could see all the fishes properly 
 286 
you should do more
of this stuff 
 287 
  so  look  any messages today 
  yeah  i wrote a couple down 
 288 
so there were two 
there were two messages  right 
 289 
you want me to write down
all your messages 
 290 
okay  who are the ones
that you didn t write down from 
 291 
  sighs  
 292 
no  gone completely 
 293 
oh  no 
there was one from your mum 
 294 
she said don t forget lunch 
and her leg s hurting again 
 295 
  no one else 
  absolutely no one else 
 296 
though if we re going for this obsessive
writing down all the message thing 
 297 
some american girl called anna
called a few days ago 
 298 
  what did she say 
  well  it was genuinely bizarre 
 299 
she said   hi  it s anna  
then she said   call me at the ritz    
 300 
and then gave herself
a completely different name 
 301 
  which was 
  absolutely no idea 
 302 
remembering one name s hard enough 
 303 
no  i   i know that 
she   she said that 
 304 
um  i know she s using another name 
 305 
the problem is
she left the message with my flatmate   
 306 
which was a very serious mistake 
 307 
um  i don t know  imagine  if you will 
the stupidest person you ve ever met 
 308 
  are you doing that 
  yes  sir  i have him in my mind 
 309 
and now double it 
and that is the  um   what can i say  
 310 
the git that i am living with 
 311 
and he can t remember  
 312 
  try flintstone 
  i m sorry  what 
 313 
i think she said
her name was flintstone 
 314 
i don t   i don t suppose  um 
flintstone rings any bells  does it 
 315 
  oh  i ll put you right through  sir 
  oh  my god 
 316 
hello  hi

anything cool in my entire life 
 323 
my flatmate  who ll i ll stab to death
later  never gave me the message 
 324 
i don t know 
perhaps  um 
 325 
i could drop round
for tea later or something 
 326 
  things are pretty busy here 
i might be free around 4 00

i always pick a    cartoon character 
 373

more  uh  horses in it 
 387 
  clears throat  
 388 
uh  well  we would have liked to 
 389

 391 
i m so sorry 
i arrived outside 
 392 
they thrust this thing
into my hand  
 393 
no  it s my fault 
i thought this would all be over by now 
 394 
i just wanted to sort of apologize

so  uh  tell me 
um  anna  what do you do 
 550 
  i m an actress 
  oh  splendid 
 551 
what do you do 
 552 
i m actually in the stock market myself 
so  uh  not really similar fields 
 553 
though  um   um  i have done
the odd bit of amateur stuff 
 554 
um   uh  p  g  wodehouse 
farce  all that  you know 
 555 
 careful there  vicar  
 556 
always imagined it s a pretty tough job 
though  acting 
 557 
  the wages are a scandal  aren t they 
  they can be 
 558 
i see friends from university  
clever chaps 
 559 
been in the business longer than you 
 560 
they re scraping by on seven 
eight thousand a year 
 561 
you know  it s no life 
 562 
  what sort of acting do you do 
  films  mainly 
 563 
oh  splendid  oh  well done 
how s the pay in movies 
 564 
i mean  last film you did 
what did you get paid 
 565 
fifteen million dollars 
 566 
right 
 567 
so that s  well  fairly good 
 568 
right  i think we re ready 
 569 
  ooh 
  okay 
 570 
bella  can you tell me
where i can find  
 571 
oh  sorry 
it s down the corridor on the right 
 572 
i ll show you 
 573 
  whispering   quickly  quickly 
talk very  very quickly 
 574 
what are you doing here
with anna scott 
 575 
  anna scott 
  yes  shut up 
 576 
  what  the film star 
  shh 
 577 
  oh  god 
  what 
 578 
  oh  god  oh  goddy god 
  what did you say to her 
 579 
i don t believe it 
i actually walked into the loo with her 
 580 
i was still chatting
when she started unbuttoning her jeans 
 581 
  she had to ask me to leave 
  oh  god 
 582 
    laughing  
  so you knew who she was 
 583 
of course i did  but he didn t 
 584 
well  not instantly  but i   i  
i got away with it 
 585 
  all chattering  
 586 
  what do you think of the guinea fowl 
  i m a vegetarian 
 587 
oh  god 
 588 
so  how s the guinea fowl 
 589 
best guinea fowl
i ve ever tasted 
 590 
  it s amazing how you  
 591 
    can speak right to my heart  
    all chattering  
 592 
  without saying a word  
 593 
  you can light up the dark  
 594 
    hands clapping  
    try as i may  i can never explain  
 595 
    what i hear when you
don t say a thing  
    party poppers popping  
 596 
having you here  anna  firmly
establishes what i ve long suspected  
 597 
that we really are the most
desperate lot of underachievers 
 598 
    bernie   shame 
  i m not saying it s a bad thing 
 599 
in fact  i think it s something
we should take pride in 
 600 
i m gonna give the last brownie
as a prize   
 601 
to the saddest act here 
 602 
  uh oh 
  bern 
 603 
yeah  all right 
well  obviously  it s me  isn t it 
 604 
i mean  i work in the city in a job
i don t understand 
 605 
and everyone keeps
getting promoted above me 
 606 
i haven t had a girlfriend since  
well  since puberty 
 607 
and    nobody fancies me 
 608 
and if these cheeks get any chubbier 
they never will 
 609 
  nonsense  i fancy you 
  really 
 610 
yeah  or i did
before you got so fat 
 611 
  max   you see 
and unless i m much mistaken 
 612 
your job still pays you
rather a lot of money   
 613 
whilst honey here
earns 20 pence a week   
 614 
flogging her guts out
in london s worst record store 
 615 
yes  and i haven t got hair 
i ve got feathers 
 616 
and i ve got funny goggly eyes 
and i m attracted to cruel men 
 617 
and  actually 
no one will marry me   
 618 
because  um  my boosies
have actually started shrinking 
 619 
    max   you see  it s incredibly sad 
  but on the other hand 
 620 
her best friend is anna scott 
 621 
that s true  i can t deny it 
she needs me  what can i say 
 622 
and most of her limbs work  whereas
i m stuck in this thing day and night 
 623 
in a house full of ramps 
 624 
and to add insult
to serious injury 
 625 
i ve totally given up smoking 
my favorite thing 
 626 
and  um  well  the truth is 
 627 
we can t have a baby 
 628 
oh  belle 
 629 
c est la vie 
 630 
still  um  we re lucky in lots of ways 
 631 
but surely that s worth a brownie 
  chuckling  
 632 
well  i don t know 
look at william 
 633 
  very unsuccessful professionally 
  that s true 
 634 
divorced  used to be handsome 
now kind of squidgy round the edges 
 635 
and absolutely certain never
to hear from anna again   
 636 
  once she s heard that his
nickname at school was  
  floppy 
 637 
you did 
i can t believe it  you did 
 638 
thanks very much  thank you 
well  at least i get the last brownie 
 639 
  max  
i think so  yes 
 640 
well  wait 
what about me 
 641 
i m sorry 
you think you deserve the brownie 
 642 
  chuckles  
well  a shot at it at least  huh 
 643 
you ll have to prove it 
this is a very  very good brownie 
 644 
i m gonna fight for it 
 645 
i ve been on a diet
every day since i was 19 
 646 
which basically means
i ve been hungry for a decade 
 647 
  all laughing  
 648 
i ve had a series of not nice
boyfriends  one of whom hit me 
 649 
uh  and every time
i get my heart broken 
 650 
the newspapers splash it about
as though it s entertainment 
 651 
and    it s taken two rather painful 
um  operations   
 652 
to get me looking like this 
 653 
  really 
  really 
 654 
and one day not long from now 
my looks will go 
 655 
they will discover i can t act 
 656 
and i will become
some sad  middle aged woman   
 657 
who    looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while 
 658 
no  nice try  gorgeous 
but you don t fool anyone 
 659 
    all laughing  
  no 
 660 
pathetic effort
to hog the brownie 
 661 
  thank you for such a terrific time 
  i m delighted 
 662 
  that s a great tie 
  now you re lying 
 663 
okay  it s true 
i told you i was bad at acting 
 664 
  it was lovely to meet you 
  yeah  and you  and you 
 665 
i ll wait until you ve gone
before i tell him you re a vegetarian 
 666 
  no 
    chuckling   oh 
 667 
  good night 
  i m so sorry about the loo thing 
 668 
i meant to leave 
i just     chuckles  
 669 
ring me if you want someone
to go shopping with 
 670

 671

 672 
  happy birthday  you re my style guru 
  thank you 
 673

 678

 679 
  william

 680 
  screaming  shouting  
 681 
  screaming  shouting continue  
 682 
sorry  they always do that
when i leave the house 
 683 
it s a stupid thing 
i hate it 
 684 
   floppy   huh 
  it s the hair 
 685 
  mm hmm 
  it s to do with the hair 
 686 
why is she in a wheelchair 
 687 
uh  because she had an accident
about 18 months ago 
 688 
and the pregnancy thing 
is that to do with the accident 
 689 
you know  i m not sure 
 690 
i don t think they tried for kids
before  as fate would have it 
 691 
do you want to  um  
 692 
my place is just  um  
 693 
too complicated 
 694 
that s fine 
 695 
  chuckles  
 696 
busy tomorrow 
 697 
  i thought you were leaving tomorrow 
  i was 
 698 
all these streets round here
have these mysterious communal gardens
in the middle of them 
 699 
  they re like little villages 
  let s go in 
 700 
ah  no  that s the point 
they re private villages 
 701 
only the people who live round the edges
are allowed in 
 702 
oh  you abide by rules like that 
 703 
i don t  no  no 
but others do 
 704 
i just do what i want 
  shakes railing  
 705 
um   right 
 706 
  whoopsidaisies 
    laughing  
 707 
what did you say 
 708 
  nothing 
  yes  you did 
 709 
  no  i didn t 
  you said   whoopsidaisies  
 710 
no one says   whoopsidaisies   do they 
i mean  unless they re  
 711 
there is no  unless   because no one
has said  whoopsidaisies  for 50 years 
 712 
and even then it was   it was just
little girls with blonde ringlets 
 713 
exactly  right 
so here we go again 
 714 
  oh  oh  whoopsidaisies 
    laughing  
 715 
yeah  well  it s a disease 
it s a clinical thing 
 716 
i m taking pills and having injections 
and i m told it won t last long 
 717 
  okay  stand aside 
  i don t think that s a good idea 
 718 
really  it s quite  um  tricky 
anna 
 719 
anna  don t  it s harder than it  
no  it s not  it s easy 
 720 
  birds chirping  
 721 
come on  flopsy 
 722 
right 
 723 
all right 
 724 
  grunts  
oh  bugger 
 725 
oh  god 
this could be very unpleasant 
 726 
ay 
bugger  bugger 
 727 
now what in the world in this garden
could make that ordeal worthwhile 
 728 
  it s amazing how you  
 729 
  can speak right to my heart  
 730 
nice garden 
 731 
  without saying a word  
 732 
  you can light up the dark  
 733 
    anna laughs  
    try as i may  i can never explain  
 734 
  what i hear
when you don t say a thing  
 735 
    you say it best  
    you say it best  
 736 
  when you say nothing at all  
 737 
 for june who loved this garden 
 738 
from joseph who always sat beside her  
 739 
some people do spend
their whole lives together 
 740 
  all day long i can hear  
 741 
  people talking out loud  
 742 
    but when you hold me near  
    when you hold me near  
 743 
    you drown out the crowd  
    out the crowd  
 744 
    try as they may
they can never define  
  come and sit with me 
 745 
  what s been said
between your heart and mine  
 746 
  the smile on your face
lets me know that you need me  
 747 
  there s a truth in your eyes  
 748 
    saying you ll never leave me  
  bollocks  bollocks 
 749 
  have you seen my glasses 
  no  afraid not 
 750 
big  big bollocks 
average day  my glasses are everywhere 
 751 
everywhere i look
there s a pair of glasses 
 752 
but when i want to go to the cinema 
they ve vanished 
 753 
it s one of life s real cruelties 
 754 
that s compared to  like 
earthquakes in the far east
or testicular cancer  is it 
 755 
oh  shit 
is that the time 
 756 
      continues  
  thanks for all your help
on the glasses thing 
 757 
oh  you re welcome 
did you find them 
 758 
  sort of 
  great 
 759 
  oh  the smile on your face
lets me know that you need me  
 760 
  there s a truth in your eyes  
 761 
  saying you ll never leave me  
 762 
  the touch of your hand says
you ll catch me wherever i fall  
 763 
so who left who 
 764 
  uh  she left me 
  why 
 765 
  she saw through me 
  uh oh 
 766 
that s not good 
 767 
that s not good 
 768 
you can give me
anna scott any day 
 769 
i didn t like her last film  fell asleep
as soon as the lights went down 
 770 
i don t really care
what the film s like 
 771 
any film with her in 
it s fine by me 
 772 
  men laughing  
 773 
she s not my type at all 
i prefer the other one 
 774 
you know  blonde  sweet looking 
 775 
you know  what s her name 
 776 
has an orgasm every time
you take her out for a cup of coffee 
 777 
meg ryan 
 778 
no  she s too wholesome 
the point about miss scott is   
 779 
she s got that twinkle in her eyes 
 780 
probably drug induced 
spends most of her life in bloody rehab 
 781 
well  whatever 
she s so clearly up for it 
 782 
you see  most girls  they re all like 
 stay away  chum  
 783 
but anna 
she is absolutely gagging for it 
 784 
  men laughing  
 785 
do you know that in over 50 
of the languages 
 786 
the word for  actress  is
the same as the word for  prostitute  
 787 
    men laughing  
  where did you get that from 
 788 
and anna is your definitive actress 
 789 
someone really filthy
you can just flip over and start again 
 790 
  right  that s it  sorry 
  no  no  there s really no point 
 791

 794

your conversation  but i did 
 795 
and  um  i just think  you know 
 796 
the person you re talking about
is a real person 
 797 
and i think she probably deserves
a little bit more consideration   
 798 
rather than having jerks like you
drooling over her 
 799 
oh  sod off  mate

 800 
  snickering  laughing  
 801

she works in the contracts department 
 916 
the hair  i admit 
is unfashionably frizzy 
 917 
but she s bright as a button and kisses
like a nymphomaniac on death row 
 918 
  apparently 
    others laughing  
 919 
  doorbell ringing  
 920 
now    try 
 921

 933 
keziah 
 934 
  some woodcock 
  no  thank you  i m a fruitarian 
 935 
ah 
 936 
what is a fruitarian  exactly 
 937 
we believe that
fruits and vegetables have feelings 
 938 
so we think cooking is cruel 
 939 
we only eat things that have actually
fallen from the tree or bush 
 940 
that are  in fact  dead already 
 941 
ah  oh  right 
 942 
right 
 943 
so  um  these carrots 
 944 
  have been murdered  yes 
  murdered 
 945 
poor old carrots 
that s  
 946 
that s beastly 
 947 
delicious coffee 
 948 
  i m sorry about the lamb 
    laughing  
 949 
no  i thought it was   
really  you know  interesting 
 950 
interesting means inedible 
 951 
  really inedible  yes  you re right 
    max  bella laughing  
 952 
well  maybe we ll meet again 
 953 
yeah  yeah

 955 
bye 
 956 
well 
 957 
perfect 
 958 
absolutely perfect 
 959 
and 
 960 
i think you ve forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have 
 961 
to find someone you actually    love 
who ll love you 
 962 
the chances are always minuscule 
 963 
look at me 
 964 
apart from the american  i ve only
loved two girls  both total disasters 
 965 
  that s not fair 
  one of them marries me 
then leaves me   
 966 
faster than you can say
 indiana jones  
 967 
and the other   who seriously
ought to have known better  
 968 
casually marries my best friend 
 969 
  she still loves you  though 
  in a depressingly asexual way 
 970 
  i never fancied you much  actually 
    chuckling  
 971 
  oh  god 
    laughing  
 972 
i loved you 
you were terribly funny  but   
 973 
all that kissing my ears 
 974 
i don t believe it 
this is just getting worse 
 975 
i shall find myself 30 years from now
still sitting on this sofa 
 976 
  do you wanna stay 
  yeah  why not 
 977 
all that awaits me at home
is a masturbating welshman 
 978 
here we go 
 979 
  good night 
  night 
 980 
  chattering  laughing  
 981 
  see you 
  right 
 982 
guilty 
very  very guilty 
 983 
so it seems 
 984 
  dog barking  
 985 
  doorbell rings  
 986 
hi 
 987 
can i come in 
 988 
come in 
 989 
they were taken years ago 
 990 
i know it was  
 991 
but i was poor and  
it happens a lot 
 992 
that s not an excuse 
i just  
 993 
but to make matters worse 
 994 
it now appears as though   
 995 
someone was filming me as well 
 996 
so what was a stupid
photo shoot   
 997 
now looks like a porn film 
 998 
the pictures have been sold
and they re just   
 999 
everywhere 
 1000 
i didn t know where to go 
 1001

 1004 
thank you 
 1005 
i m just in london   
 1006 
for two days 
but what with your papers 
 1007

  sniffling  
 1008 
these pictures are just so horrible 
and they re so grainy 
 1009 
it makes me look like  
 1010 
don t think about it

 1026

if he was ever gonna fly in again 
 1027 
it s not often one
has the opportunity to adios   
 1028 
the plates of
a major hollywood film star 
 1029 
it was  um  
it was thrilling for me 
 1030 
so how is he 
 1031 
i don t know 
 1032 
it just got to the point   
 1033 
where i couldn t remember
any of the reasons why we were together 
 1034 
and you and love 
 1035 
oh  well  there s a question  um 
 1036 
without an interesting answer 
 1037 
i have thought about you 
 1038 
  oh 
  it s just that   
 1039 
anytime i ve tried to keep   
 1040 
anything normal
with a person that was   
 1041 
normal 
it s just been a disaster 
 1042 
listen  i appreciate that 
absolutely 
 1043 
so what is that 
a film you re doing 
 1044 
um  start in l a  on tuesday 
 1045 
would you like me to
take you through your lines 
 1046 
would you 
 cause it s all talk  talk  talk 
 1047 
hand it over 
 1048 
right 
um  basic plot 
 1049 
i m a difficult but brilliant
junior officer   
 1050 
who in about 20 minutes is gonna
save the world from nuclear disaster 
 1051 
mm hmm  okay 
well done  you 
 1052 
 message from command  would you
like them to send in the h k s  
 1053 
no  turn over four t r s s
and tell them we need radar feedback   
 1054 
before the k f t s return at 1900 
 1055 
then inform the pentagon we ll need
black star cover from 1000 through 1215 
 1056 
and if you say one word about how many
mistakes i made in that speech 
i ll pelt you with olives 
 1057 
  very well  captain 
i ll pass that on straightaway 
  thank you 
 1058 
  how many mistakes did i make 
  eleven 
 1059 
  damn it  and wainwright  
  cartwright 
 1060 
cartwright  wainwright 
whatever your name is 
 1061 
i promised little jimmy
i d be home for his birthday 
 1062 
so could you get a message to him
that i may be late 
 1063 
certainly 
and  uh  little johnny 
 1064 
  my son s name is johnny 
  yep 
 1065 
  then get a message to him too 
  i ll do what i can  captain 
 1066 
but i can t promise anything 
 1067 
  and cartwright goes 
    exhales  
 1068 
  what do you think 
  gripping  it s not jane austen 
 1069 
it s not henry james 
but it s    gripping 
 1070 
  think i should do henry james instead 
  you would be brilliant 
 1071 
but this writer   writers  
they re pretty damn good too 
 1072 
you never get anyone
on wings of the dove saying 
 1073 
 inform the pentagon
we need black star cover  
 1074 
for me the book is the poorer for it 
 1075 
i can t believe you have that picture 
 1076 
you like chagall 
 1077 
i do  it feels like
how love should be  
 1078 
floating through a dark blue sky 
 1079 
with a goat  playing a violin 
 1080 
well  yes 
 1081 
happiness isn t happiness
without a violin playing goat 
 1082

about men with big feet 
 1085 
no 
what s that 
 1086 
uh  big feet 
 1087 
large    shoes 
 1088 
the thing that is so irritating   
 1089 
is that now i m so fierce
when it comes to nudity clauses 
 1090 
you actually have    clauses
in your contract about nudity 
 1091 
definitely 
 1092 
 you may show the dent of the top of the
artist s buttocks  but neither cheek  
 1093 
or if there s
a stunt bottom being used   
 1094 
 artist must have full consultation  
 1095 
  you have a stunt bottom 
  i could have a stunt bottom  yes 
 1096 
are people tempted to go
for better bottoms than their own 
 1097 
yeah    chuckling   i would 
this is important stuff 
 1098 
it s one hell of a job  isn t it 
what do you put on your passport 
 1099

 1103

 1203 
your furry friend thought he d make
a buck telling the papers where i was 
 1204 
  that s not true 
  really 
 1205 
the entire british press
got up this morning and thought 
 i know where anna scott is 
 1206

in notting hill  
 1207 
then you go out

 1210 
  i m so sorry 
  this is such an unbelievable mess 
 1211 
i come to you to protect myself
against more crappy gossip 
 1212 
and now i ve landed in it
all over again 
 1213 
for god s sake  i ve got a boyfriend 
 1214

  as far as they re concerned i do 
 1215

pictures of you in every newspaper
from here to timbuktu 
 1216 
i know that  but   
just let s stay calm 
 1217 
you stay calm  this is a perfect
situation for you  isn t it 
 1218 
minimum input  maximum publicity 
 1219 
everywhere you go  people will say 
 well done  you 
 1220 
you slept with that actress 
we saw the pictures  
 1221 
  that is spectacularly unfair 
  that s yours 
 1222 
maybe it ll even help business 
 1223 
buy a boring book about egypt
from the guy that screwed anna scott 
 1224 
stop  stop  i beg you 
 1225 
calm down 
how about a cup of tea 
 1226

    doorbell rings  
 1228 
spike  see who that is 
and put some clothes on  for god s sake 
 1229 
    clamoring  
  looks like a chauffeur to me 
 1230 
spike owes you
an expensive dinner or holiday 
 1231 
depending who s got the brains
to get the going rate on betrayal 
 1232 
that is not true 
wait a minute 
 1233 
this is crazy behavior 
 1234 
can t we just
laugh about all this 
 1235 
seriously  in the huge sweep of things 
this stuff doesn t matter 
 1236 
what he s gonna say next is
there s people starving in the sudan 
 1237 
well  there are  and we don t
have to go anywhere near that far 
 1238 
my best friend slipped down stairs 
cracked her back   
 1239 
and she s in a wheelchair
for the rest of her life 
 1240 
all i m asking for is
a normal amount of perspective 
 1241 
you re right 
of course  you re right 
 1242 
it s just that i ve dealt
with this garbage for ten years 
 1243 
you ve had it for ten minutes 
 1244 
our perspectives are very different 
 1245 
today s newspapers will be lining
tomorrow s wastepaper bin 
 1246 
  excuse me 
  you know 
 1247 
it s just one day 
 1248 
tomorrow  today s papers
will all have been thrown out 
 1249 
you really don t get it 
 1250 
this story will be filed 
 1251 
every time anyone writes anything
about me  they ll dig up these photos 
 1252 
newspapers last forever 
 1253 
i ll regret this forever 
 1254 
right 
 1255 
right 
 1256 
i will feel the opposite 
 1257 
if that s okay by you  and  uh 
 1258 
always be glad that you   
came to stay 
 1259 
but  um  you re probably right 
 1260

 1261 
  doorbell rings  
 1262 
  clamoring

 1290 
  blimey  what is it 
    sighing  
 1291

in london   
 1292

 1293

the time  now you can ring her 
 1294 
yeah  brilliant  thanks 
 1295 
i ll see you tonight 
hey  marty  ooh  sexy cardi 
 1296 
  tapping on glass  
 1297 
shh  hello 
i have a little speech to make 
 1298 
i won t stand up because
i can t    be bothered 
 1299 
exactly a year ago today  this man here
started the finest restaurant in london 
 1300 
  hear  hear 
  thank you very much 
 1301 
unfortunately 
no one ever came to eat here 
 1302 
  it s a tiny hiccup 
    laughing  
 1303 
and so we have to face the fact
that from next week 
 1304 
we must find somewhere new to eat 
 1305 
i just want to say to tony   
don t take it personally 
 1306 
the more i think about things  the more
i see no rhyme or reason in life 
 1307 
no one knows why some things work out
and some things don t 
 1308 
why some of us get lucky   
 1309 
  and some of us  
  get fired 
 1310 
  what 
  no 
 1311 
yeah  well  it seems
they re shifting the whole outfit   
 1312 
much more towards
the emerging markets 
 1313 
and  of course  well 
i was total crap  so  
 1314 
a toast to bernie   the worst
stockbroker in the whole world 
 1315 
i thank you 
and tony  the worst restauranteur 
 1316 
  tony and bernie  both crap   
  the terrible two 
 1317 
in their own special ways 
 1318 
  chattering  
 1319 
since it s an evening
of announcements 
 1320 
uh  i ve also got one 
 1321 
um  i ve decided to get engaged 
 1322 
i ve found myself a nice 
slightly odd looking bloke   
 1323 
who i know is gonna make me happy
for the rest of my life 
 1324 
wait a sec  i mean  i  
 1325 
i m your brother  i don t know
anything about this  is he  
 1326 
  is he financially viable 
    chuckling  
 1327 
he s an artist   
with brilliant prospects 
 1328 
  this is a secret
you ve been keeping from me 
    bella   no  i swear 
 1329 
  whispering  
by the way  it s you 
 1330 
  me 
  what do you think 
 1331 
well  yeah 
 1332 
groovy 
 1333 
excuse me 
are there any more announcements 
 1334 
well  actually  yes 
 1335 
i feel i should
apologize to everyone   
 1336 
for my behavior
over the last six months 
 1337 
i have  as you know 
been somewhat down in the mouth 
 1338 
there s an understatement 
there are dead people on better form 
 1339 
but i just wish to make it clear
that i ve turned a corner 
 1340 
and  um  henceforward intend
to be impressively happy 
 1341 
    piano  
 1342 
  without a love of my own  
 1343 
    blue moon  
    ba boom  ba boom  
 1344 
  you knew just what i was there for  
 1345 
oh  god  i m horribly drunk 
 1346 
  you heard me saying a prayer for  
 1347 
  come here 
    ba boom  ba boom  
 1348 
  someone i really could care for  
 1349 
  so you ve laid the ghost 
    wah  wah  wah  wah  
 1350 
i believe i have 
 1351 
don t give a damn
about the famous girl 
 1352 
no 
 1353 
no  i don t think i do 
 1354 
which means you won t be distracted
by the fact that she s back in london   
 1355 
grasping her oscar   
 1356 
and currently to be found filming 
most days  on hampstead heath 
 1357 
oh  god  no 
 1358 
so not over her  in fact 
 1359 
  laughter  
 1360 
  can i help you 
  yeah  i m  um  
 1361 
  i m looking for anna scott 
  does she know you re coming 
 1362 
no  no  uh  she doesn t 
 1363 
  i m afraid i can t let you through 
  right 
 1364 
i mean  i am actually a friend 
i m not a lunatic  but  
 1365 
  no  you basically  er  
  can t let you through  sir 
 1366 
well  this is  uh  
 1367 
i only found out
you were here yesterday 
 1368 
  i was going to call  but i  
    woman   uh  anna 
 1369 
yes  um  
 1370 
things aren t going very well 
and it s our last day 
 1371

 1372 
but if   if you could wait 
 1373 
there are    things to say 
 1374

i have to be in new york on thursday 
 1386 
oh  stop showing off 
god  that s an enormous ass 
 1387 
  i m not listening 
  but seriously  it s not fair 
 1388 
so many tragic young teenagers
with anorexia   
 1389 
and that girl has an ass
she could perfectly well share around   
 1390 
with at least ten other women
and still be big bottomed 
 1391 
i would think  looking at
something nice like that 
 1392 
you and your   
bony little excuse for an arse   
 1393 
would be well advised to keep quiet 
 1394 
now down to business 
the end of the scene 
 1395 
now down to business 
the end of the scene 
 1396 
um  i ask you when you re
telling everyone  and you say  
 1397 
um  tomorrow will be soon enough 
 1398 
and then i   right  okay 
 1399 
say  who was that rather diffident chap
i saw you talking to round the back 
 1400 
no one 
 1401 
just some guy from the past  i  
 1402 
it s a bit of an awkward situation 
i don t know what he s doing here 
 1403 
 course 
 1404 
thanks  i ve got to  um  
 1405 
any time 
 1406 
  man   ladies and gentlemen 
can we have you on your first marks 
 1407 
on your first marks 
 1408

whilst you re cooking the books 
 1409 
but  uh  there s a delivery for you 
 1410 
martin  really 
can t you just do it yourself 
 1411 
but you see  this is not for the shop 
this is for you 
 1412 
right  okay 
 1413

 1414 
hi

hello 
 1416 
you disappeared 
 1417 
yeah  yeah  um  
 1418

i didn t want to disturb 
 1419 
  how have you been 
  fine  fine  everything much the same 
 1420 
when they change the law 
spike and i will marry immediately 
 1421 
whereas you  i ve watched in wonder 
 1422 
  awards  glory 
  oh  no 
 1423 
it s   it s all nonsense  believe me 
 1424 
i d no idea how much nonsense
it was  but   
 1425 
nonsense it all is 
 1426 
well  um  
 1427 
yesterday was our last day of filming 
so    i m leaving 
 1428 
but  um  
 1429 
i brought this for you from home 
 1430 
so i thought i d give it to you 
 1431 
thank you 
 1432 
shall i  
 1433 
oh  no  don t open it now 
i ll be embarrassed 
 1434 
well  thank you  i don t know
what it s for  but thanks anyway 
 1435 
actually  i had it in my apartment 
and i thought you d  
 1436 
but when it came to it 
i didn t know how to call 
 1437 
having behaved so badly 
 1438 
twice 
 1439 
so it s just been
sitting in the hotel 
 1440 
then you came and    i figured  
 1441 
the thing is  
 1442 
the thing is  
 1443 
what  what is the thing 
 1444 
don t even think about it 
go away immediately 
 1445 
  go away 
  right 
 1446 
sorry 
 1447 
you were saying 
 1448 
yes 
 1449 
i have to go away today  but l   
 1450 
wondered if i didn t   
 1451 
whether you might
let me see you a little 
 1452 
or    a lot  maybe 
 1453 
see if you could like me again 
 1454 
but yesterday
that actor asked you who i was 
 1455 
and you just
dismissed me out of hand 
 1456 
i heard 
 1457 
you had a microphone 
i had headphones 
 1458 
you expect me
to tell the truth about my life   
 1459 
to the most indiscreet man
in england 
 1460 
uh  excuse me 
 1461 
it s your mother on the phone 
 1462 
will you tell her
i ll ring her back 
 1463 
i ve actually tried that tack  but
she said you ve said that once before 
 1464 
and it s now been about 24 hours   
 1465 
and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in color and  
 1466 
right  right  yeah 
perfect timing  as ever 
 1467 
martin  hold the fort a second 
 1468 
uh  yes  all right 
 1469 
um  could i just say  
 1470 
  chuckles   i thought ghost
was the most wonderful film 
 1471 
  is that right 
  oh  yes 
 1472 
  chuckles  
 1473 
um  i ve always wondered   
 1474 
what patrick swayze s like
in   in   in real life 
 1475 
i can t say that i know patrick
all that well 
 1476 
he wasn t that friendly during filming 
 1477 
well  i m sure he was friendly to
demi moore who acted with him in ghost 
 1478 
oh  oh  right 
 1479 
sorry 
  nervous chuckle  
 1480 
always been a bit of an ass 
  chuckling  
 1481 
um  anyway   um  
 1482 
well  it was lovely to meet you 
 1483 
i m a huge  huge fan of yours 
 1484 
and demi s  of course 
 1485 
sorry 
 1486 
that s fine 
 1487 
there s always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict 
 1488 
anna  look  um  
 1489 
i m a fairly levelheaded bloke 
 1490 
not often in and out of love 
 1491 
but  uh  
 1492 
can i just say no to your   
 1493 
kind request and  uh  leave it at that 
 1494 
yes 
 1495 
fine  of course  i  
 1496 
of course 
 1497 
i ll just be going  then 
it was nice to see you 
 1498 
the thing is 
 1499 
with you i m in real    danger 
 1500 
it seems like a    perfect situation 
 1501 
apart from that
foul temper of yours  but   
 1502 
my relatively inexperienced heart
would  i fear  not   
 1503 
recover  uh  if i was   
 1504 
once again cast aside 
as i would absolutely expect to be 
 1505 
there are just too many pictures of you 
too many films 
 1506 
you d go and i d be  uh 
 1507 
well  buggered  basically 
 1508 
that really is a real no  isn t it 
 1509 
i live in notting hill 
you live in    beverly hills 
 1510 
everyone in the world
knows who you are 
 1511 
my mother has trouble
remembering my name 
 1512 
fine 
 1513 
fine  good decision 
good decision 
 1514 
the fame thing isn t really real 
you know 
 1515 
and don t forget i m  
 1516 
i m also just a girl   
 1517 
standing in front of a boy   
 1518

 1519

some cellulite down there

 1544 
so she can    deliver a line  but  um 
 1545

as famous as she can be 
 1546 
but also that she was   
 1547 
just a girl   
 1548 
standing in front of a boy   
 1549 
asking him    to love her

i leave tonight 
 1643 
which is why we have to round things
up now  so final questions  please 
 1644 
yes  lady there 
 1645 
is your decision to take
a year off anything to do   
 1646 
with the rumors about jeff
and his present leading lady 
 1647 
  absolutely not 
  do you believe the rumors 
 1648 
well  it s really
not my business anymore 
 1649 
though i will say  from my experience 
rumors about jeff do tend to be true 
 1650 
  laughter  
 1651 
yeah  the last time you were here  there
were some fairly graphic photographs   
 1652 
taken of you
with a young english guy 
 1653 
so  uh  what happened there 
 1654 
he was just a friend 
we re still friends  i think 
 1655 
    reporters clamoring  
  right  um  
 1656 
yes  gentleman in the pink shirt 
 1657 
yes  miss scott 
 1658 
are there any circumstances in which   
 1659 
the two of you   
 1660 
might be more than just good friends 
 1661 
i hoped there would be  but no 
i m    assured there aren t 
 1662 
  but what would you say if  
  sorry  just the one question  please 
 1663 
no  it s all right 
you were saying 
 1664 
i was just wondering if  uh 
 1665 
it turned out that this person  uh  
 1666 
  man  3  
thacker  his name was thacker 
 1667 
  thanks  thanks 
    laughter  
 1668 
i just wondered whether if   
 1669 
mr  thacker realized he d been
a daft prick   
 1670 
  reporters chattering  
 1671 
and got down on his knees and   
begged you to reconsider 
 1672 
whether you would  in fact  then   
 1673 
reconsider 
 1674 
  yes  i believe i would 
    reporters chattering  
 1675 
that s very good news 
um  
 1676 
the readers of horse   hound
will be absolutely delighted 
 1677 
  laughter  
 1678 
right  uh  dominic  if you d
like to ask your question again 
 1679 
yeah  anna  how long are you
intending to stay here in britain 
 1680 
indefinitely 
 1681 
  she may be the face i can t forget  
 1682 
  the trace of pleasure or regret  
 1683 
  may be my treasure
or the price i have to pay  
 1684 
    she may be the song that  
  what happened 
 1685 
    summer sings  
  it was good 
 1686 
  may be the chill the autumn brings  
 1687 
  may be a hundred different things  
 1688 
  within the measure of a day  
 1689 
  she may be the beauty or the beast  
 1690 
  may be the famine or the feast  
 1691 
  may turn each day
into a heaven or a hell  
 1692 
  she may be the mirror of my dream  
 1693 
  the smile reflected in a stream  
 1694 
  she may not be what she may seems  
 1695 
  inside her shell  
 1696 
  crowd cheering  shouting  
 1697 
  she who always seems
so happy in a crowd  
 1698 
  whose eyes can be
so private and so proud  
 1699 
  no one s allowed to see them  
 1700 
  when they cry  
 1701 
  she may be the love
that cannot hope to last  
 1702 
  may come to me
from shadows of the past  
 1703 
  that i remember till the day i die  
 1704 
  she may be the reason i survive  
 1705 
  the why and wherefore i m alive  
 1706 
  the one i ll care for
through the rough  
 1707 
  and ready years  
 1708 
  me  i ll take her laughter
and her tears  
 1709 
  and make them all my souvenirs  
 1710 
  for where she goes i ve got to be  
 1711 
  the meaning of my life is
