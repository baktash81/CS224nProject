piano
man continues indistinct

piano
man continues indistinct
9
she may be the face
i cant forget
10
a trace of pleasure or regret
11
may be my treasure or the price
12
i have to pay
13
she may be the mirror
14
of my dream
15
a smile reflected in a stream
16
she may not be what she may seem
17
inside her shell
18
she who always seems
so happy in a crowd
19
whose eyes can be
so private and so proud
20
no ones allowed
to see them when they cry
21
she may be the love
that cannot hope to last
22
may come to me
from shadows of the past
23
that ill remember till the day
24
i die
25
she may be the reason i survive
26
the why and wherefore im alive
27
the one ill care for
through the rough
28
and ready years
29
me ill take her laughter
and her tears
30
and make them all my souvenirs
31
for where she goes ive got to be
32
the meaning of my life is
33
she
34
she
35
oh she
36
man narrating
of course ive seen her films
37
man narrating
of course ive seen her films
38
and always thought
she was well fabulous
39
but you know a million million miles
from the world i live in
40
which is here notting hill
my favorite bit of london
41
theres the market on weekdays selling
every fruit and vegetable known to man
42
rock hard bananas
five for a pound
43
the tattoo parlor
with a guy outside who got drunk
44
and now cant remember
why he chose i love ken
45
the radical hairdressers
where everyone comes out
looking like the cookie monster
46
whether they want to or not
47
and then suddenly
its the weekend
48
and from break of day hundreds
of stalls appear out of nowhere
49
filling portobello road
right up to notting hill gate
50
and wherever you look thousands of
people are buying millions of antiques
51
some genuine and some
not quite so genuine
52
and whats great is that lots of friends
have ended up in this part of london
53
thats tony for example
architect turned chef
54
who recently invested all the money
he ever earned in a new restaurant
55
and so this is where
i spend my days and years
56
in this small village in the middle of
the city in a house with a blue door
57
that my wife and i bought together
before she left me for a man
58
who looked exactly like harrison ford
59
and where i lead a strange halflife
with a lodger called
60
spike
61
you couldnt help me with an incredible
important decision could you
62
is this important in comparison to
lets say whether they should cancel
third world debt
63
thats right i am at last going out
on a date with the great janine
64
and i just wanna be sure
ive picked the right tshirt
65
what are the choices
well wait for it
66
first theres this one
growls  cool huh
67
yeah it might make it hard
to strike a really romantic note
68
point taken
dont despair
69
if its romance were looking for
i believe i have just the thing
70
yeah well there again she might not
think you had true love on your mind
71
right
just one more
72
true love here i come
73
well yeah yeah thats
thats um perfect
74
great thanks
75
wish me luck
good luck
76
narrating  and so it was
just another hopeless wednesday
77
as i walked the thousand yards
through the market to work
78
never suspecting that this was the day
that was gonna change my life forever
79
this is work by the way
my little travel bookshop
80
morning martin
morning monsignor
81
which um well sells travel books
82
and to be frank with you
doesnt always sell many of those
83
classic
profit from major sales push
84
minus 347 pounds
85
shall l uh
go and get you a cappuccino
86
you know ease the pain a bit
yeah yeah
87
better make it a half
all i can afford
88
get your logic
demicappu coming right up
89
doorbell dings
90
um can i help you at all
91
no thanks
ill just look around
92
fine
93
uh that books really not great
94
just in case you know browsing turned
to buying youd be wasting your money
95
but if its turkey
youre interested in
96
um this one on the other hand
is very good
97
um i think the man who wrote it has
actually been to turkey which helps
98
um theres also
a very amusing incident with a kebab
99
um which is one
of many amusing incidents
100
thanks
ill think about it
101
or in the bigger hardback variety
theres
102
im sorry
can you just give me a second
103
excuse me
104
yes
bad news
105
what
106
weve got a security camera
in this bit of the shop
107
so
108
so i saw you put that book
down your trousers
109
what book
the one down your trousers
110
i dont have a book
down my trousers
111
right
112
i tell you what
um ill call the police and um
113
if im wrong about the whole
book down the trousers scenario
114
i really apologize
115
okay what if i did
have a book down my trousers
116
well ideally
when i went back to the desk
117
youd remove the cadogan guide
to bali from your trousers
118
and either wipe it
and put it back or buy it
119
ill see you in a sec
120
im sorry about that
121
no its fine
122
i was gonna steal one
but now ive changed my mind
123
oh signed by the author
i see
124
um yeah couldnt stop him
125
if you can find an unsigned one
its worth an absolute fortune
126
chuckles
excuse me
127
yes
can i have your autograph
128
uh sure
129
uh
here
130
whats your name

tempting
135
but no
thank you
136
i will take this one
137
oh right right
so uh
138
well on second thoughts
um maybe its not that bad after all
139
actually its a sort
of a classic really
140
none of those childish kebab stories
you find in so many books these days
141
and um i tell you what
142
ill throw in
one of those for free
143
useful for uh lighting fires
144
wrapping fish
that sort of thing
145
thanks
pleasure
146
door closes
147
cappuccino as ordered
148
thanks
149
i dont think youll believe
who was just in here
150
who
was it someone famous
151
no no no
no
152
would be exciting though
wouldnt it if someone famous
came into the shop hmm
153
do you know
and this is pretty amazing actually
154
but i once saw ringo starr
155
where was that
kensington high street
156
at least i think it was ringo
157
it might have been that man
from fiddler on the roof
158
you know toppy
topol
159
yes thats right
topol
160
mmhmm
161
actually ringo starr doesnt
doesnt look at all like uh topol
162
yeah but he was
he was quite a long way away from me
163
so actually it couldve
been neither of them
164
yes i suppose so yes
165
its not a classic anecdote is it
not a classic no no
166
another one
sighs  yes no
167
lets go crazy
ill have an orange juice
168
people chattering

175
no thank you
i just need to get my car back
176
i also have a phone
im confident that in five minutes
177
we could have you spickandspan
and back on the street again
178
in the nonprostitute sense
obviously
179
all right well what do you mean
just over the street
180
give it to me in yards
uh 18 yards
181
give it to me in yards
uh 18 yards
182
thats my house there
with the blue front door
183
come on in
ill just ill just
184
um right right
come in
185
its um not quite as tidy
as it normally is i fear
186
but um
the bathrooms on the top floor
187
and the telephones just
just up here
188
here
let let me um
189
um round the corner
straight on straight on up
190
bugger
191

192
uhoh
193
uh
194
would you like a cup of tea
before you go
195
no
coffee
196
no
orange juice
197
probably not
um something else cold
198
uh
199
bottles rattling
coke water
200
some disgusting sugary drink
201
pretending to have something to do
with fruits of the forest
202
no
would you like something to eat
203
uh something to nibble
204
um apricots soaked in honey
205
quite why no one knows because
it stops them tasting of apricots
206
and makes them taste like honey
207
and if you wanted honey youd just
buy honey instead of apricots
208
um but nevertheless
there we go there
209
theyre yours if you want them
210
no
211
do you always say no
to everything

kinda spacey
283
theres something wrong
with the goggles though

though if were going for this obsessive
writing down all the message thing
297
some american girl called anna

what did she say
well it was genuinely bizarre
299
she said hi its anna
then she said call me at the ritz
300
and then gave herself
a completely different name
301
which was
absolutely no idea
302
remembering one names hard enough
303
no i i know that
she she said that
304
um i know shes using another name
305
the problem is
she left the message with my flatmate

the stupidest person youve ever met
308

413

i was still chatting
when she started unbuttoning her jeans
581
she had to ask me to leave
oh god
582
laughing

can speak right to my heart
all chattering
592
without saying a word
593
you can light up the dark
594
hands clapping
try as i may i can never explain
595
what i hear when you
dont say a thing
party poppers popping
596
having you here anna firmly
establishes what ive long suspected
597
that we really are the most
desperate lot of underachievers
598
bernie  shame
im not saying its a bad thing
599
in fact i think its something
we should take pride in
600
im gonna give the last brownie
as a prize
601
to the saddest act here
602
uhoh
bern
603
yeah all right
well obviously its me isnt it
604
i mean i work in the city in a job
i dont understand
605
and everyone keeps
getting promoted above me
606
i havent had a girlfriend since
well since puberty
607
and nobody fancies me
608
and if these cheeks get any chubbier
they never will
609
nonsense i fancy you
really
610
yeah or i did
before you got so fat
611
max  you see
and unless im much mistaken
612
your job still pays you
rather a lot of money
613
whilst honey here
earns 20 pence a week
614
flogging her guts out
in londons worst record store
615
yes and i havent got hair
ive got feathers
616
and ive got funny goggly eyes
and im attracted to cruel men
617
and actually
no one will marry me
618
because um my boosies
have actually started shrinking
619
max  you see its incredibly sad
but on the other hand
620
her best friend is anna scott
621
thats true i cant deny it
she needs me what can i say
622
and most of her limbs work whereas
im stuck in this thing day and night
623
in a house full of ramps
624
and to add insult
to serious injury
625
ive totally given up smoking
my favorite thing
626
and um well the truth is
627
we cant have a baby
628
oh belle
629
cest la vie
630
still um were lucky in lots of ways
631
but surely thats worth a brownie
chuckling
632
well i dont know
look at william
633
very unsuccessful professionally
thats true
634
divorced used to be handsome
now kind of squidgy round the edges
635
and absolutely certain never
to hear from anna again
636
once shes heard that his
nickname at school was
floppy
637
you did
i cant believe it you did
638
thanks very much thank you
well at least i get the last brownie
639
max
i think so yes
640
well wait
what about me
641
im sorry
you think you deserve the brownie
642
chuckles
well a shot at it at least huh
643
youll have to prove it
this is a very very good brownie
644
im gonna fight for it
645
ive been on a diet
every day since i was 19
646
which basically means
ive been hungry for a decade
647
all laughing
648
ive had a series of notnice
boyfriends one of whom hit me
649
uh and every time
i get my heart broken
650
the newspapers splash it about
as though its entertainment
651
and its taken two rather painful
um operations
652
to get me looking like this
653
really
really
654
and one day not long from now
my looks will go
655
they will discover i cant act
656
and i will become
some sad middleaged woman
657
who looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while
658
no nice try gorgeous
but you dont fool anyone
659
all laughing
no
660
pathetic effort
to hog the brownie
661
thank you for such a terrific time
im delighted
662
thats a great tie
now youre lying
663
okay its true
i told you i was bad at acting
664

when i leave the house
683

i hate it
684
floppy huh
its the hair
685
mmhmm
its to do with the hair
686
why is she in a wheelchair
687
uh because she had an accident
about 18 months ago
688
and the pregnancy thing
is that to do with the accident
689
you know im not sure
690
i dont think they tried for kids
before as fate would have it
691
do you want to um
692
my place is just um
693
too complicated
694
thats fine
695
chuckles
696
busy tomorrow
697
i thought you were leaving tomorrow
i was
698
all these streets round here
have these mysterious communal gardens
in the middle of them
699
theyre like little villages
lets go in
700
ah no thats the point
theyre private villages
701
only the people who live round the edges
are allowed in
702
oh you abide by rules like that
703
i dont no no
but others do
704
i just do what i want

laughing
707

708
nothing
yes you did
709
no i didnt
you said whoopsidaisies
710
no one says whoopsidaisies do they
i mean unless theyre
711
there is no unless because no one
has said whoopsidaisies for 50 years
712
and even then it was it was just
little girls with blonde ringlets
713
exactly right
so here we go again
714
oh oh whoopsidaisies
laughing
715
yeah well its a disease
its a clinical thing
716
im taking pills and having injections
and im told it wont last long
717

718
really its quite um tricky
anna
719

720
birds chirping

could make that ordeal worthwhile
728
its amazing how you
729
can speak right to my heart
730
nice garden
731
without saying a word
732
you can light up the dark
733
anna laughs
try as i may i can never explain
734
what i hear
when you dont say a thing
735
you say it best
you say it best
736
when you say nothing at all
737
for june who loved this garden
738
from joseph who always sat beside her
739
some people do spend
their whole lives together
740
all day long i can hear
741
people talking out loud
742
but when you hold me near
when you hold me near
743
you drown out the crowd
out the crowd
744
try as they may
they can never define
come and sit with me
745
whats been said
between your heart and mine
746
the smile on your face
lets me know that you need me
747
theres a truth in your eyes
748
saying youll never leave me
bollocks bollocks
749
have you seen my glasses
no afraid not
750
big big bollocks
average day my glasses are everywhere
751
everywhere i look
theres a pair of glasses
752
but when i want to go to the cinema
theyve vanished
753
its one of lifes real cruelties
754
thats compared to like
earthquakes in the far east
or testicular cancer is it
755
oh shit
is that the time
756
continues
thanks for all your help
on the glasses thing
757
oh youre welcome
did you find them
758
sort of
great
759
oh the smile on your face
lets me know that you need me
760
theres a truth in your eyes
761
saying youll never leave me
762
the touch of your hand says
youll catch me wherever i fall
763
so who left who
764
uh she left me
why
765
she saw through me
uhoh
766
thats not good
767
thats not good
768
you can give me
anna scott any day
769
i didnt like her last film fell asleep
as soon as the lights went down
770
i dont really care
what the films like
771
any film with her in
its fine by me
772
men laughing
773
shes not my type at all
i prefer the other one
774
you know blonde sweetlooking
775
you know whatshername
776
has an orgasm every time
you take her out for a cup of coffee
777
meg ryan
778
no shes too wholesome
the point about miss scott is
779
shes got that twinkle in her eyes
780
probably druginduced
spends most of her life in bloody rehab
781
well whatever
shes so clearly up for it
782
you see most girls theyre all like
stay away chum
783
but anna
she is absolutely gagging for it
784
men laughing
785
do you know that in over 50
of the languages
786
the word for actress is
the same as the word for prostitute
787
men laughing
where did you get that from
788
and anna is your definitive actress
789
someone really filthy
you can just flip over and start again
790
right thats it sorry
no no theres really no point
791
all laughing
792
um sorry
sorry to disturb you guys
793
but um
can i help
794
well yeah i wish i hadnt overheard
your conversation but i did
795
and um i just think you know
796
the person youre talking about
is a real person
797
and i think she probably deserves
a little bit more consideration
798
rather than having jerks like you
drooling over her
799
oh sod off mate
what are you her dad
800
snickering laughing
801

ah
936
what is a fruitarian exactly
937
we believe that
fruits and vegetables have feelings

we only eat things that have actually
fallen from the tree or bush
940
that are in fact dead already

absolutely perfect
959
and
960
i think youve forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have
961
to find someone you actually love
wholl love you
962
the chances are always minuscule
963
look at me
964
apart from the american ive only
loved two girls both total disasters
965
thats not fair
one of them marries me
then leaves me
966
faster than you can say
indiana jones
967
and the other who seriously
ought to have known better
968
casually marries my best friend
969
she still loves you though
in a depressingly asexual way
970
i never fancied you much actually
chuckling
971
oh god
laughing
972
i loved you
you were terribly funny but
973
all that kissing my ears
974
i dont believe it
this is just getting worse
975
i shall find myself 30 years from now
still sitting on this sofa
976
do you wanna stay
yeah why not
977
all that awaits me at home
is a masturbating welshman
978
here we go

1089
is that now im so fierce
when it comes to nudity clauses
1090
you actually have clauses
in your contract about nudity
1091
definitely
1092
you may show the dent of the top of the
artists buttocks but neither cheek
1093
or if theres
a stunt bottom being used
1094
artist must have full consultation
1095
you have a stunt bottom
i could have a stunt bottom yes
1096
are people tempted to go
for better bottoms than their own
1097

1304
we must find somewhere new to eat
1305
i just want to say to tony
dont take it personally
1306
the more i think about things the more
i see no rhyme or reason in life
1307
no one knows why some things work out
and some things dont
1308
why some of us get lucky
1309
and some of us
get fired
1310
what
no
1311

theyre shifting the whole outfit
1312
much more towards
the emerging markets
1313

i was total crap so
1314
a toast to bernie the worst
stockbroker in the whole world
1315
i thank you
and tony the worst restauranteur
1316
tony and bernie both crap
the terrible two

over the last six months
1337
i have as you know
been somewhat down in the mouth
1338
theres an understatement
there are dead people on better form
1339
but i just wish to make it clear
that ive turned a corner
1340
and um henceforward intend
to be impressively happy
1341
piano

1343
blue moon

about the famous girl

1388
so many tragic young teenagers
with anorexia
1389
and that girl has an ass
she could perfectly well share around
1390
with at least ten other women
and still be bigbottomed
1391
i would think looking at
something nice like that
1392
you and your
bony little excuse for an arse
1393
would be well advised to keep quiet
1394
now down to business
the end of the scene
1395
now down to business
the end of the scene
1396
um i ask you when youre
telling everyone and you say

i saw you talking to round the back
1400

yesterday was our last day of filming

and i thought youd
1436
but when it came to it
i didnt know how to call
1437
having behaved so badly
1438
twice
1439
so its just been
sitting in the hotel
1440
then you came and i figured
1441
the thing is
1442
the thing is
1443
what what is the thing
1444
dont even think about it
go away immediately
1445
go away
right
1446
sorry
1447
you were saying
1448
yes
1449
i have to go away today but l
1450
wondered if i didnt
1451
whether you might
let me see you a little
1452
or a lot maybe
1453
see if you could like me again
1454
but yesterday
that actor asked you who i was
1455
and you just
dismissed me out of hand
1456
i heard
1457
you had a microphone
i had headphones
1458
you expect me
to tell the truth about my life
1459
to the most indiscreet man
in england
1460
uh excuse me
1461
its your mother on the phone
1462
will you tell her
ill ring her back
1463
ive actually tried that tack but
she said youve said that once before
1464
and its now been about 24 hours
1465
and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in color and
1466
right right yeah
perfect timing as ever
1467
martin hold the fort a second
1468
uh yes all right
1469
um could i just say
1470
chuckles  i thought ghost
was the most wonderful film
1471
is that right
oh yes
1472
chuckles
1473
um ive always wondered
1474
what patrick swayzes like
in in in real life
1475
i cant say that i know patrick
all that well
1476
he wasnt that friendly during filming
1477
well im sure he was friendly to
demi moore who acted with him in ghost
1478
oh oh right
1479
sorry
nervous chuckle
1480
always been a bit of an ass
chuckling
1481
um anyway um
1482
well it was lovely to meet you
1483
im a huge huge fan of yours
1484
and demis of course
1485
sorry
1486
thats fine
1487
theres always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict
1488
anna look um
1489
im a fairly levelheaded bloke
1490
not often in and out of love
1491
but uh
1492
can i just say no to your
1493
kind request and uh leave it at that
1494
yes
1495
fine of course i
1496
of course
1497
ill just be going then
it was nice to see you
1498
the thing is
1499
with you im in real danger
1500
it seems like a perfect situation
1501
apart from that
foul temper of yours but
1502

yeah the last time you were here there

1680
indefinitely
1681
she may be the face i cant forget
1682
the trace of pleasure or regret
1683
may be my treasure
or the price i have to pay
1684
she may be the song that
what happened
1685
summer sings
it was good
1686
may be the chill the autumn brings
1687
may be a hundred different things
1688
within the measure of a day
1689
she may be the beauty or the beast
1690
may be the famine or the feast
1691
may turn each day
into a heaven or a hell
1692
she may be the mirror of my dream
1693
the smile reflected in a stream
1694
she may not be what she may seems
1695
inside her shell
1696
crowd cheering shouting
1697
she who always seems
so happy in a crowd
1698
whose eyes can be
so private and so proud
1699
no ones allowed to see them
1700
when they cry
1701
she may be the love
that cannot hope to last
1702
may come to me
from shadows of the past
1703
that i remember till the day i die
1704
she may be the reason i survive
1705
the why and wherefore im alive
1706

through the rough
1707
and ready years
