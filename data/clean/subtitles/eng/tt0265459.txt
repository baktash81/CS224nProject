what was it about william
yorkin that upset you so
i mean what did he do
to provoke all of this
children laughing
family photos depict smiling faces
births
weddings
holidays
happy birthday
childrens birthday parties
people take pictures of the
happy moments in their lives
someone looking through our photo album
would conclude that we had led
a joyous leisurely existence
free of tragedy
no one ever takes a photograph
of something they want to forget

mrs levitt has a problem

alright
ive been doing pos minilab
work for over 20 years now
i consider it an important job
when houses are on fire
whats the first thing they save after
their pets and loved ones are safe
the family photos
some people think that
this is a job for a clerk
they actually believe that any idiot
attending a twoday seminar
can master the art of making
beautiful prints in less than an hour
but of course like most things
theres far more to it than meets the eye
ive seen the prints they fob off
on people at the rexall or fotek
milky washed out prints
too dark prints
theres no sense of reverence for
the service theyre providing people
i process these photos
as if they were my own
i see someone had quite a birthday party
i did them 5 by 7 for you
oh
i wanted them 4 by 6
erm
the larger ones are better i
didnt charge you extra for them
okay its okay i guess
how much do i owe you sy
3006 but lets call it an even 30

oh jake
i really feel bad for him
but jake
we dont know that sy is sad
we really dont know that
much about him you know
i mean he might even have a lot of friends
and he probably has a girlfriend and
a mummy and a daddy who love him
i dont think he does
that is so sweet of you to think of
somebody else like that you know
listen jake
not everybody is as lucky as we are
you know
but maybe if we send them good thoughts
itll make them feel better
why dont we close our eyes
and send sy some good thoughts

i bet next time we see sy
he wont seem so sad
okay

their pictures on weekends

only takes pictures of her cats
ive never seen a picture of
a human being just the cats
two copies please mr parrish
theres mr siskind mr siskind

big part of our  business
new parents go photo crazy

cindy a nurse from a nearby cosmetic
surgery clinic is a regular customer

thanks for your precision work
christmas music plays
sy
what the hell you doing
excuse me
what was the deal with
you and the agfa guy
bill im trying to preserve a minimal
level of quality for my customers
your customers
he seems to think that a plus 3 shift
to cyan is insignificant its massive
sy let me try and explain
something to you one more time
you need to look again at
your place on the food chain
these arent your customers
theyre savmarts customers
if you havent noticed
this isnt neiman marcus
people just want to come in here
with their kids have a good time
and to save a few pennies
on paper towels and socks
if they wanted to see yelling and
screaming theyd stay at home
it was wrong of me to create a
scene in front of all those customers
bill it wont happen again
sy dont you have some
vacation time saved up
i guess i probably do
you should take some time
off go down to a club med
you know relax lay
in the sun enjoy life

i told you not to talk to strangers
im sure my customers
never think about it
but these snapshots are their
little stands against the flow of time
the shutter is clicked
the flash goes off
and theyve stopped time
if just for the blink of an eye
and if these pictures have anything
important to say to future generations
its this
i was here
i existed
i was young i was happy
and someone cared enough
about me in this world
to take my picture
how much for this one
most people dont take
snapshots of the little things
the used bandaid
the guy at the gas station
the wasp on the jello
but these are the things that
make up the true picture of our lives
people dont take pictures of these things
jaki you really have to
tidy up your room pal

lets face it i was fat
i was sick all the time
kept coming down with mono and hepatitis
then i broke my collarbone
and i had to wear a weird cast
i kept my arm up like this all winter
i wasnt exactly the most popular kid
howd you break your collarbone
i fell out of a tree
hows your dad doing
good
does he come to see the games
yeah sometimes
does he come to any games
hes really busy at work i
dont know hes busy all the time
sounds like an important guy
i guess he owns a
company and everything
probably wants you and your
mum to have nice things you want
like that cool bike
and those soccer shoes
those things cost money
hed be here if he could
i guess
i got something for you
wanna guess what it is

thats right youve been doing
our pictures for a long time
you know i almost feel like uncle sy
giggles
well ive got some
serious shopping to do sy
oh sure
take care
oh my god
what
its so weird i im reading
that exact book right now
youre kidding
no i cant believe that
youd be reading that book
he writes a lot about noticing
coincidence doesnt he
yeah he does
that thing he says about fear
the things we fear the most
have already happened to us
wow
i had no idea you were
such a deep thinker sy
i wouldnt say that
do you have any children sy

a day without taking a picture something
lucky for us
okay bye sy
bye
sy parrish please see the manager
sy to the managers office
immediately please
whats with the getup sy
its wednesday bill
i was doing the srs
sy theres been some
discrepancies in the click count
oh thats probably yoshi
his math skills are weak
i told you that when you
moved him over from audio
all the discrepancies are on
logs you initialled
they are
yeah
i guess sometimes at the end
of the week you get a little tired
were not talking a few
innocent math errors sy
the netclicks all zero out
they always zero out
the problem is the shutdown
clicks dont correspond at all
they dont even come close to matching
the amount of prints that weve sold
then its probably the reorder counter
well i asked larry about that
what did he say
well he looked at the counter
and said that it checked out
he also said in 14 years of servicing
hes never seen a faulty
counter on an agfa unit
really
so the question is sy where did all
those unaccounted for prints go
whats the discrepancy are
we talking about bill
were talking hundreds of prints sy
ha
thats not possible bill
oh ive done the math
the pos confirm it too
i dont know anything about it
well i think you do sy
well i dont bill
look sy ive got a family
im not losing my job over this
im letting you go
no
oh
these log discrepancies would be
enough but youre spacing out on
taking 90 minute lunch breaks
creating scenes in front of customers
giving away free merchandise
what
free disposable cameras to
customers on their birthday
that must have been your bright
idea sure as shit isnt company policy
you cant do this
its done sy
i talked to sims at district  now finish
out the week and clear out your locker
if you do something like fuck
up the todays prints
i havent fucked up a
customers prints in 11 years

ah
according to the oxford
english dictionary
the word snapshot was first used in 1808
by an english sportsman by
the name of sir andrew hawker
he noted in his diary that almost
every bird he shot that day
was taken by snapshot
meaning a hurried shot
taken without deliberate aim
snapshot then was
originally a hunting term
camera begins clicking
can i help you sy
just dropping off some
film just a customer
i can still shop here cant i bill
no sy you cant still shop here
i believe i can bill
theres no law that says i cant
shop here because i was fired
check it out sy theres thousands
other places to do photos
theres no reason to come
down here and to fuck with me
a very good reason
i calibrated that machine personally
its the best minilab in the state
alright sy
just this one time
but find another place to do your film
i do not want you back in here
thanks bill
what is it you cant just
leave your station unmanned

what we got there is it
the anal sex fiend again
mother fucker
what was mr parrishs
demeanour when he came in
demeanour
yeah
how did he seem did he seem
upset or agitated in any way
i dont know he seemed fine
sy and i had some words
when he came into the store
under the circumstances
i was surprised to
see him and asked him
what he was doing here
i suggested in strong language he
bring his pictures somewhere else
i gonna need xerox copies of this
can you show me where i get that done
yeah
mr owens why dont you grab a
seat and try to calm down
your wife and child theyre
somewhere safe now
theyre at my mothers
im sorry im a little upset
no no no no i understand
its understandable
so how did he take to being fired
i fire a lot of people people
get upset when they get fired
and he got pretty upset
he knew mr araki would show
the photos to you and that youd call us
i think its just a warning
but you have to take it seriously
we take it very seriously
your childs life was indirectly
threatened we take no chances
theres an apb on him
officers are en rout to his home
with a search warrant
i have officers inside the store and out
he may come back and pick up
his photos he may not
its hard to say i doubt he will
you really think thats a good idea
i mean this place is wall to wall family
if hes stupid enough to come back here
hell never make it inside the store

dad
are you married detective
you have any children
ill be the one asking
the questions here sy
just one question
detective are you a family man
thats none of your business sy
youre right it isnt
it is none of my business but
im guessing by your answer and
that ring on your finger that you are
and that makes you a very fortunate man
i can also tell by the
way youve treated me
and the way you carry out your job
youre a good man a good
husband and father a man
who appreciates his good fortune
youre not the type of father
whod cheat on his wife
hurt his family betray their trust
you would never neglect
and abuse your children
make horrible demands of your children
you would never ask
you would never ask
your children to do things
things that children shouldnt do
you would never take disgusting
sick degrading pictures
of your children doing these things
you would never treat
your children like animals
will yorkin had it all
and he threw it all away
he is not a good father
well i er
i think i understand now sy
thank you for answering
my questions so candidly
youre welcome
