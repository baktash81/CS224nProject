to provoke all of this 
 children laughing 
family photos depict smiling faces 
births 
weddings 
holidays
happy birthday 
children s birthday parties 
people take pictures of the
happy moments in their lives 
someone looking through our photo album
would conclude that we had led
a joyous leisurely existence 
free of tragedy 
no one ever takes a photograph
of something they want to forget

mrs levitt has a problem

alright 
i ve been doing p o s mini lab
work for over 20 years now 
i consider it an important job 
when houses are on fire 
what s the first thing they save after
their pets and loved ones are safe 
the family photos 
some people think that
this is a job for a clerk 
they actually believe that any idiot
attending a two day seminar
can master the art of making
beautiful prints in less than an hour 
but of course like most things 
there s far more to it than meets the eye 
i ve seen the prints they fob off
on people at the rexall or fotek 
milky washed out prints 
too dark prints 
there s no sense of reverence for
the service they re providing people 
i process these photos
as if they were my own 
i see someone had quite a birthday party 
  i did them 5 by 7 for you 
  oh 
i wanted them 4 by 6 
erm 
the larger ones are better i
didn t charge you extra for them 
okay  it s okay i guess 
  how much do i owe you sy 
  30 06 but let s call it an even 30

what 
i feel bad for someone 
somebody at school

what do you mean you feel bad 
when someone seems sad 
they don t have any friends
and people make fun of them 
that makes me feel bad for them 
who is sad and doesn t have any friends 
 sy 
 sy 
  the photo guy at the one hour place 
  yeah 
  oh jake 
  i really feel bad for him 
but jake 
we don t know that sy is sad 
we really don t know that
much about him you know 
i mean he might even have a lot of friends 
and he probably has a girlfriend and
a mummy and a daddy who love him 
i don t think he does 
that is so sweet of you to think of
somebody else like that  you know 
listen jake 
not everybody is as lucky as we are 
you know 
but maybe if we send them good thoughts 
it ll make them feel better 
why don t we close our eyes
and send sy some good thoughts 
  okay 
  okay  alright 
  ready 
  yeah

i bet next time we see sy

level of quality for my customers 
your customers

to cyan is insignificant  it s massive

something to you one more time 
you need to look again at
your place on the food chain

they re sav mart s customers 
if you haven t noticed 
this isn t neiman marcus 
people just want to come in here
with their kids  have a good time 
and to save a few pennies
on paper towels and socks 
if they wanted to see yelling and
screaming they d stay at home 
it was wrong of me to create a
scene in front of all those customers
bill  it won t happen again

never think about it 
but these snapshots are their
little stands against the flow of time 
the shutter is clicked 
the flash goes off 
and they ve stopped time 
if just for the blink of an eye 
and if these pictures have anything
important to say to future generations 
it s this 
 i was here 
 i existed 
 i was young  i was happy 
 and someone cared enough
about me in this world 
 to take my picture 
how much for this one 
most people don t take
snapshots of the little things 
the used band aid 
the guy at the gas station 
the wasp on the jell o 
but these are the things that
make up the true picture of our lives 
people don t take pictures of these things

company and everything 
probably wants you and your
mum to have nice things you want

i got something for you

after all you d think we d run

why do you live around here 
i live down town

you know i almost feel like uncle sy 
 giggles 
well i ve got some
serious shopping to do sy 
oh sure 
take care 
  oh my god 
  what 
it s so weird i    i m reading

you re kidding 
no  i can t believe that
you d be reading that book 
he writes a lot about noticing
coincidence  doesn t he 
yeah  he does 
that thing he says about fear 
 the things we fear the most
have already happened to us 
wow 
i had no idea you were
such a deep thinker sy 
i wouldn t say that 
  do you have any children sy 
  me  no  no  i m not married 
  no girlfriend 
  no 
i have a snapshot of my mother though

a day without taking a picture something 
lucky for us 
  okay bye sy 
  bye 
sy parrish please see the manager 
sy to the manager s office
immediately please 
what s with the getup sy 
it s wednesday bill 
i was doing the srs 
sy there s been some
discrepancies in the click count 
oh that s probably yoshi 
his math skills are weak 
i told you that when you
moved him over from audio 
all the discrepancies are on
 logs you initialled 
  they are 
  yeah 
i guess sometimes at the end
of the week  you get a little tired   
we re not talking a few
innocent math errors sy 
the net clicks all zero out 
they always zero out 
the problem is the shut down
clicks don t correspond at all 
they don t even come close to matching
the amount of prints that we ve sold 
then it s probably the reorder counter 
  well i asked larry about that 
  what did he say 
well he looked at the counter
and said that it checked out 
he also said in 14 years of servicing 
he s never seen a faulty
counter on an agfa unit 
really 
so the question is sy where did all
those unaccounted for prints go 
what s the discrepancy are
we talking about bill 
we re talking hundreds of prints sy 
ha 
that s not possible bill 
oh i ve done the math 
the p o  s confirm it too 
i don t know anything about it 
well i think you do sy 
well i don t bill 
look sy  i ve got a family 
i m not losing my job over this 
i m letting you go 
no 
oh 
these log discrepancies would be
enough but you re spacing out on   
taking 90 minute lunch breaks 
creating scenes in front of customers 
 giving away free merchandise 
  what 
free disposable cameras to
customers on their birthday 
that must have been your bright
idea  sure as shit isn t company policy 
  you can t do this 
  it s done sy 
i talked to sims at district   now finish
out the week and clear out your locker 
if you do something like fuck
up the todays prints 
i haven t fucked up a
customer s prints in 11 years 
just get back out there

tv is on  the universe

it is no concern of ours how
 you run your own planet

ah 
according to the oxford
english dictionary 
the word  snapshot  was first used in 1808 
by an english sportsman by
the name of sir andrew hawker 
he noted in his diary that almost
every bird he shot that day
was taken by snapshot 
meaning a hurried shot 
taken without deliberate aim 
 snapshot  then  was
originally a hunting term 
 camera begins clicking 
can i help you sy 
just dropping off some
film  just a customer 
  i can still shop here can t i bill 
  no sy you can t still shop here 
i believe i can bill 
there s no law that says i can t
shop here because i was fired 
check it out sy there s thousands
other places to do photos 
there s no reason to come
down here and to fuck with me 
a very good reason 
i calibrated that machine personally 
it s the best mini lab in the state 
alright sy 
just this one time 
but find another place to do your film 
i do not want you back in here 
thanks bill 
what is it  you can t just
leave your station unmanned 
i think you need to see these sir 
what we got there  is it
the anal sex fiend again  
mother fucker 
what was mr parrish s
demeanour when he came in 
demeanour 
yeah 
how did he seem  did he seem
upset or agitated in any way 
i don t know  he seemed fine 
sy and i had some words
when he came into the store 
under the circumstances
i was surprised to
see him  and asked him
what he was doing here 
i suggested in strong language he
bring his pictures somewhere else 
i gonna need xerox copies of this 
can you show me where i get that done 
yeah 
mr owens why don t you grab a
seat and try to calm down 
your wife and child they re
somewhere safe now 
they re at my mother s 
i m sorry i m a little upset 
no  no  no  no  i understand
it s understandable 
so how did he take to being fired 
i fire a lot of people  people
get upset when they get fired 
and he got pretty upset 
he knew mr araki would show
the photos to you and that you d call us 
i think it s just a warning 
  but you have to take it seriously 
  we take it very seriously 
your child s life was indirectly
threatened  we take no chances 
there s an apb on him 
officers are en rout to his home
with a search warrant 
i have officers inside the store and out 
he may come back and pick up
his photos  he may not 
it s hard to say  i doubt he will 
you really think that s a good idea 
i mean this place is wall to wall family 
if he s stupid enough to come back here 
he ll never make it inside the store 
mr parrish  this is the police

detective are you a family man 
that s none of your business sy 
you re right it isn t 
it is none of my business  but
i m guessing by your answer and
that ring on your finger that you are 
and that makes you a very fortunate man 
i can also tell by the
way you ve treated me
and the way you carry out your job 
you re a good man  a good
husband and father  a man
who appreciates his good fortune 
you re not the type of father
who d cheat on his wife 
hurt his family  betray their trust 
you would never neglect
and abuse your children 
make horrible demands of your children 
you would never ask   
you would never ask
your children to do things   
things that children shouldn t do 
you would never take disgusting 
sick  degrading pictures
of your children doing these things 
you would never treat
your children like animals
