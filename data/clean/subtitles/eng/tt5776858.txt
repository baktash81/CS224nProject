what do you mean 
you can sew almost anything
into the canvas of a coat 
secrets 
coins 
words  little messages 
when i was a boy  i
started to hide things
in the linings of the garments 
things that only i
knew were there 
and over my breast  i have a
lock of my mother s hair 
to keep her close to me always 
she was quite a remarkable woman 
she taught me my trade 
so i try to never be without her 
you must love her very much 
hello 
this is alma  say hello to alma 
hello 
this is alma  come
say hello to alma 
  come on  come on 
  hello 
shall we show her the house  lads 
i made this dress for her
when i was 16 years old 
it s beautiful 
 twas for her second
husband  for the wedding 
my father had died
many years before 
our nanny  the evil
miss blackwood   
black death  we used to call her 
because of superstition  she
refused to help me sew the dress 
as she believed it would
bring her bad fortune 
to never be a bride 
not that anyone
would have had her 
and she seemed ancient to
us  i have no idea how
old she actually was 
and monstrously ugly 
so   
i worked alone for
months and months 
hunched over 
sewing and sweating and sewing 
and the black death
never married anyway 
all the help i could
have had from her 
 twas my sister  cyril  came
to my rescue in the end 
there are endless superstitions
when making a wedding dress 
young girls afraid they ll
never marry if they touch one 
or models afraid they ll
marry only bald men
if they put one on 
and where s the dress now 
i have no idea what
happened to it 
no idea 
most probably turned
to ashes by now 
fallen to pieces 
and your sister 
what 
did she ever marry 
no 
c mon  boys  let s have a fire 
if you want to have a staring
contest with me  you will lose 
you re a very handsome man 
you must be around
many beautiful women 
yes 
so  why are you not married 
i make dresses 
you cannot be married
when you make dresses 
i m certain i was
never meant to marry 
i m a confirmed bachelor 
i m incurable 
marriage would make me deceitful
and i don t ever want that 
you sound so sure about things 
i m sure about that 
i think you re only acting strong 
no  i am strong 
for who  not for me  i hope 
i think it s the expectations
and assumptions of others
that cause heartache 
would you help me with something 
  yes 
  come on 
good  just jump up
on the box for me 
i think we re going to try and
pull this back for you 
pretty good 
one moment 
we ll save that one
for another time 
quite nice 
but   
bit serious 
this one 
do you like it 
  yes 
  it s very good 
that s it 
let s get that off you  and then
i d like to take your
measurements  is that all right 
and who s this lovely creature
making the house smell so nice 
hello  i m alma

six and a half 
twenty five

would you try something
else for me 
yes 
you have the ideal shape 
i do 
he likes a little belly 
i never really liked myself 
i thought my
shoulders were too wide 
my neck was skinny like a bird 
that i had no breasts 
i felt my hips were
larger than needed 
and my arms too strong 
i feel as if i ve been looking
for you for a very long time 
you found me 
whatever you do 
do it carefully 
but in his work  i become perfect 
and i feel just right 
good evening  mr woodcock  sir 
maybe that s how all women
feel in his clothes 
you look beautiful  really 
very beautiful 
you re making me extremely hungry 
  thank you 
  i ordered you a steak tartare 
oh  perfect  thank you 
my little carnivore 
i ve just been on the telephone

sometimes
we wake up at 4 00 in the morning 
after we ve gone to
bed at midnight 
and then he s ready
to start again 
and i can stand endlessly 
no one can stand as long as i can 
what is it  alma 
what are you looking
so forlorn about 
i don t know  i   
i think i don t like
the fabric so much 
well  alma  this fabric is adored
by the women who wear our design 
it s perfect for this dress 
cyril is right 
cyril is always right 
it s not because the
fabric is adored
by the clients that
cyril is right 
it s right because it s right 
because it s beautiful 
maybe one day you ll
change your taste  alma 
maybe not 
maybe you have no taste 
maybe i like my own taste 
yes  just enough to
get you into trouble 
  perhaps i m looking for trouble 
  stop 
you know  at the big races
and the derby and  those   
  yes 
  excuse me  mr woodcock 
i would like to say
that i hope one
day i could wear one
of your dresses 
oh  thank you 
if that s your wish  i hope
it comes true for you 
she really means it 
she told me she wants to be
buried in a dress that you make 
thank you

good night

maybe you pay too
much attention to it 
it s hard to ignore 
it s as if you just rode
a horse across the room 
this is too much movement 
it is entirely too much
movement at breakfast 
perhaps you should take
your breakfast after him 
or in your room 
i think he s being too fussy 
his routine  when he s in
it  is best not shaken 
  well   
  this is a quiet time 
not to be misused 
if breakfast isn t right 
it s very hard for him to recover
for the rest of the day 
i didn t know that 
no  of course you didn t 
but you do now 
still i think he s too fussy 
well  that s as may be 
this is flemish bobbin

that i want to 
well  if you re looking

inappropriate time to

him in my own way

a sculpture of some kind 
so will you make her
a wedding gown 
i have made her baptism 
her first communion and
confirmation dresses 
i made the dress for her
presentation at court

usually  you always
tell me what you think 
what is this 
you re lying 
as i think you know  alma 
i prefer my asparagus
with oil and salt 
and knowing this  you ve prepared
the asparagus with butter 
now  i can imagine in
certain circumstances
being able to pretend that
i like it made this way 
right now  i m just
admiring my own gallantry
for eating it the way
you ve prepared it 
i don t know what i m doing here 
i don t know what i m doing here 
i m just waiting around
like an idiot for you 
this was an ambush 
alma  to what purpose 
this is not   
i know it s not going
as i expected 
i didn t mean these
things to come out 
i m sorry  but it was
meant to be nice

i wanted time with you  i
wanted to have you to myself 
  you have me all the time

there are always people around 
and if not  then there s
something between us 
  something between us 
  yes 
  what 
  some   
  what 
  distance 
when did this happen 
what happened to make
you behave like this 
is it because you think
i don t need you 
  yes 
  i don t 
well  that s very
predictable of you 
don t act so tough 
i know you are not 
yeah  that s right  that s
right  if i don t protect myself
somebody will come in
the middle of the night
and take over my
corner of the room
and ask me about their
fucking asparagus 
don t be a bully 
you re being a bully 
there are other things i d like
to do with my time  it s my time

an idiot waiting for you 
  waiting for what 
  waiting for you 
waiting for what 
waiting for you to get rid of me 
to tell me to leave 
so tell me 
so i don t stand around

asparagus  is this all
about your asparagus 
  no  it s not about asparagus

to you in every respect 
why don t you just fuck off

slow down his steps a little 
would you like me to
ask alma to leave

than when you last saw me 
  really 
  yes 
thank you very much indeed 
it s fallen off me 
ooh  i m so sorry 
there are secrets nobody tells 
your wife has got that gorgeous
glow you get with
a first marriage 
how long will you be here for 
seems my godson s rather
enjoying that glow as well 
so  what are your plans
for new year s eve 
oh   
we don t have any 
well  you should come out for
the chelsea arts club ball 
  i don t know what that is 
  it s not something i d suggest
if i didn t think you d
have a wonderful time 
it s really something to be seen 
i ll pass it on to my husband 
but i think we ll stay in 
change your mind 
or get him to change his
mind  or whatever it takes 
now  please come  i promise
you the time of your life 
how do you know how
my life has been 
i don t

and truly shaken now

go back to the bar
where you belong 
oh  sorry 
let s not start cheating
at this stage  alma 
i m not cheating  i
don t need to cheat 
oh  good  you do need to be able
to count  on the other hand 
backgammon  by the way 
i get treble the score
because you haven t gotten
any checkers off the board 
oh 
stupid game anyway 
well  maybe it seems stupid to you
now as you re currently losing 
but i dare say if you
were victorious 
i m confident you d see
it in a different light 
now  they need your chair
for my next opponent  next 
me  please 
what  what are you
so cranky about 
have fun with your next opponent 
why  i think i will  a lot
more than i did with you 
gosh  she s really
very rude  isn t she 
my heart breaks for you 
oh  really 
being married to a toddler 
i don t want to be racist 
but  i mean  is there some sort of
custom at this time of the night
in her country  where   
  i mean  what s she doing 
  where what 
i don t know  i don t know
if she s up stealing things
or attacking people  i mean   
i want to go dancing 
when 
right now 
  you re joking 
  no  i m not 
it s new year s eve 
well  i m not going dancing 
there s a party at the devonshire
hall to celebrate the new year
and i want to go 
we need to go dancing 
so what are you going
to do about it 
i m going to stay right
here and i m going to work

are you ready to welcome in our
lovely  glorious  happy new year

well  i think it
feels a little big 
shall we just take
it in on the waist 
we can take it in a
little on the waist 
  yes 
  yes  okay  just take it out 
how s that feeling  i
think that s better 
would you excuse me for a
minute  please  mrs vaughan 
where has henrietta harding been 
  she s been to another house 
  which one 
  why didn t you tell me 
  because i didn t want to 
is there something i m unaware of 
because as far as i can remember 
all i have done is to
dress her beautifully 
i don t think that
matters to some people 
i think they want what
is fashionable and chic 
chic  oh  don t you start using
that filthy little word   chic  
whoever invented that ought to
be spanked in public  i don t   
i don t even know
what that word means 
what is that word  fucking  chic  
they should be hung  drawn and
quartered  fucking  chic  
it shouldn t concern
you  it does concern me 
it concerns me very much  cyril 
because it s hurt my feelings 
it s hurt my feelings 
so  what s all this moaning about 
i am not moaning 
i do not like to be
turned away from 
nobody does 
but i don t want to hear it
because it hurts my ears 
i ve made a terrible mistake in
my life  cyril  i ve made a   
i ve made a terrible mistake 
i need you to help me 
what do you want me to do 
i can t work  i can t concentrate 
i have no confidence 
she does not fit in this house 
we built this house 
the two of us 
now  she s turning the whole
bloody place upside down 
she s turning me inside out 
she s turning you and
me against each other 
her arrival has cast a
very long shadow  cyril 
mrs vaughan is satisfied
with the dress 
no one gives a
tinker s fucking curse
about mrs vaughan s satisfaction 
thank you  alma 
not at all 
what a model of
politeness you two are 
there is an air of quiet
death in this house
and i do not like
the way it smells 
would you like a glass of wine 
no  thank you 
can i make you a martini 
nothing for me  thanks 
water 
i want you flat on your back 
helpless 
tender 
open 
with only me to help 
and then i want you strong again 
you re not going to die 
you might wish you were going to
die  but you re not going to 
you need to settle down a little 
kiss me  my girl  before i m sick 
i think  perhaps  you
should telephone
that boy doctor of
yours  just in case 
you don t trust me 
no  i do trust you  it s just   
if you wish 
but i will make you well again 
i will 
i love you 
i love you  too 
and i think  perhaps  you
should leave the room 
  close the door behind you 
  yes 
i ll be right outside 
if he didn t wake up from this 
if he wasn t here tomorrow 
no matter 
for i know he d be waiting
for me in the afterlife 
or some safe  celestial place
in this life and the next
and the next one after 
and for whatever there is on the
road that follows from here 
it would only require my patience
to get to him again 
you see  to be in love with him
makes life no great mystery 
say   ah  
very good 
you can put your robe back on 
sometimes i jump ahead
in our life together 
and i see a time near the end 
i can predict the future and
everything has settled 
and all our lovers and
children and friends
come back and are welcome 
and we have large gatherings
where everyone is laughing
and playing games 
i am older and i see
things differently 
and i finally understand you 
and i take care of your dresses
