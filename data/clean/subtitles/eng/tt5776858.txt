i like to see who im talking to
here

do you have a photograph
yes
would you let me see it
not here at home
carry it with you
always carry her with you
wheres yours
your mother
shes here in the canvas
what do you mean
you can sew almost anything
into the canvas of a coat
secrets
coins
words little messages
when i was a boy i
started to hide things
in the linings of the garments
things that only i
knew were there
and over my breast i have a
lock of my mothers hair
to keep her close to me always
she was quite a remarkable woman
she taught me my trade
so i try to never be without her
you must love her very much
hello
this is alma say hello to alma
hello
this is alma come
say hello to alma
come on come on
hello
shall we show her the house lads
i made this dress for her
when i was 16 years old
its beautiful
twas for her second
husband for the wedding
my father had died
many years before
our nanny the evil
miss blackwood
black death we used to call her
because of superstition she
refused to help me sew the dress
as she believed it would
bring her bad fortune
to never be a bride
not that anyone
would have had her
and she seemed ancient to
us i have no idea how
old she actually was
and monstrously ugly
so
i worked alone for
months and months
hunched over
sewing and sweating and sewing
and the black death
never married anyway
all the help i could
have had from her
twas my sister cyril came
to my rescue in the end
there are endless superstitions
when making a wedding dress
young girls afraid theyll
never marry if they touch one
or models afraid theyll
marry only bald men
if they put one on
and wheres the dress now
i have no idea what
happened to it
no idea
most probably turned
to ashes by now
fallen to pieces
and your sister
what
did she ever marry
no
cmon boys lets have a fire
if you want to have a staring
contest with me you will lose
youre a very handsome man
you must be around
many beautiful women
yes
so why are you not married
i make dresses
you cannot be married
when you make dresses
im certain i was
never meant to marry
im a confirmed bachelor
im incurable
marriage would make me deceitful
and i dont ever want that
you sound so sure about things
im sure about that
i think youre only acting strong
no i am strong
for who not for me i hope
i think its the expectations
and assumptions of others
that cause heartache
would you help me with something
yes
come on
good just jump up
on the box for me
i think were going to try and
pull this back for you
pretty good
one moment
well save that one
for another time
quite nice
but
bit serious
this one
do you like it
yes
its very good
thats it
lets get that off you and then
id like to take your
measurements is that all right
and whos this lovely creature
making the house smell so nice

he likes a little belly
i never really liked myself
i thought my
shoulders were too wide
my neck was skinny like a bird
that i had no breasts
i felt my hips were
larger than needed
and my arms too strong
i feel as if ive been looking
for you for a very long time
you found me
whatever you do
do it carefully
but in his work i become perfect
and i feel just right
good evening mr woodcock sir
maybe thats how all women
feel in his clothes
you look beautiful really
very beautiful
youre making me extremely hungry
thank you
i ordered you a steak tartare
oh perfect thank you
my little carnivore

and i can stand endlessly
no one can stand as long as i can
what is it alma
what are you looking
so forlorn about
i dont know i
i think i dont like
the fabric so much
well alma this fabric is adored
by the women who wear our design
its perfect for this dress
cyril is right
cyril is always right
its not because the
fabric is adored
by the clients that
cyril is right
its right because its right
because its beautiful
maybe one day youll
change your taste alma
maybe not
maybe you have no taste
maybe i like my own taste
yes just enough to
get you into trouble
perhaps im looking for trouble
stop
you know at the big races
and the derby and those
yes
excuse me mr woodcock
i would like to say
that i hope one
day i could wear one
of your dresses
oh thank you
if thats your wish i hope
it comes true for you

buried in a dress that you make
thank you
thank you ladies

you seem thirsty
morning reynolds
morning cyril
please dont move so much alma
im buttering my toast
im not moving too much
well its too much
its a distraction
its very distracting
maybe you pay too
much attention to it
its hard to ignore
its as if you just rode
a horse across the room
this is too much movement
it is entirely too much
movement at breakfast
perhaps you should take
your breakfast after him
or in your room
i think hes being too fussy
his routine when hes in
it is best not shaken
well
this is a quiet time
not to be misused
if breakfast isnt right
its very hard for him to recover
for the rest of the day
i didnt know that
no of course you didnt
but you do now
still i think hes too fussy
well thats as may be
this is flemish bobbin
lace from the late 1600s

one will be there but me
ill be waiting for him
i will surprise him and we
can have dinner together

why
because he doesnt like surprises
he does
well he wont like this one
im trying to surprise him
and love him the way
that i want to
well if youre looking
for something kind to do
perhaps you could think
of something else

could be a more
inappropriate time to
try something new
this is what i want to do
and i think it will be very nice
i respect your advice cyril

him in my own way
and this is what i
want to do for him

youre lying
as i think you know alma
i prefer my asparagus
with oil and salt
and knowing this youve prepared
the asparagus with butter

admiring my own gallantry
for eating it the way
youve prepared it
i dont know what im doing here
i dont know what im doing here
im just waiting around

predictable of you

right if i dont protect myself
somebody will come in
the middle of the night

would you excuse me for a
minute please mrs vaughan
where has henrietta harding been
shes been to another house
which one
why didnt you tell me
because i didnt want to
is there something im unaware of
because as far as i can remember
all i have done is to
dress her beautifully
i dont think that
matters to some people
i think they want what
is fashionable and chic
chic oh dont you start using
that filthy little word chic
whoever invented that ought to
be spanked in public i dont
i dont even know
what that word means
what is that word fucking chic
they should be hung drawn and
quartered fucking chic
it shouldnt concern
you it does concern me
it concerns me very much cyril
because its hurt my feelings
its hurt my feelings
so whats all this moaning about
i am not moaning
i do not like to be
turned away from
nobody does
but i dont want to hear it
because it hurts my ears
ive made a terrible mistake in
my life cyril ive made a
ive made a terrible mistake
i need you to help me
what do you want me to do
i cant work i cant concentrate
i have no confidence
she does not fit in this house
we built this house
the two of us
now shes turning the whole
bloody place upside down
shes turning me inside out
shes turning you and
me against each other
her arrival has cast a
very long shadow cyril
mrs vaughan is satisfied
with the dress
no one gives a
tinkers fucking curse
about mrs vaughans satisfaction
thank you alma
not at all
what a model of
politeness you two are
there is an air of quiet
death in this house
and i do not like
the way it smells
would you like a glass of wine
no thank you
can i make you a martini
nothing for me thanks
water
i want you flat on your back
helpless
tender
open
with only me to help
and then i want you strong again
youre not going to die
you might wish you were going to
die but youre not going to
you need to settle down a little
kiss me my girl before im sick
i think perhaps you
should telephone
that boy doctor of
yours just in case
you dont trust me
no i do trust you its just
if you wish
but i will make you well again
i will
i love you
i love you too
and i think perhaps you
should leave the room
close the door behind you
yes
ill be right outside
if he didnt wake up from this
if he wasnt here tomorrow
no matter
for i know hed be waiting
for me in the afterlife
or some safe celestial place
in this life and the next
and the next one after
and for whatever there is on the
road that follows from here
it would only require my patience
to get to him again
you see to be in love with him
makes life no great mystery
say ah
very good
you can put your robe back on
sometimes i jump ahead
in our life together
and i see a time near the end
i can predict the future and
everything has settled
and all our lovers and
children and friends
come back and are welcome
and we have large gatherings
where everyone is laughing
and playing games
i am older and i see
things differently
and i finally understand you
and i take care of your dresses
