the most destructive kind  
  yesterday  when i was young
  the taste of life was sweet  
  as rain upon my tongue  
  i d teased at life  
  as if it were a foolish game  
  the way the evening breeze  
  may tease a candle flame  
  the thousand dreams
i dreamed  
  the splendid things
i planned  
  i always built to last
on weak and shifting sand  
  i lived by night
  and shunned the naked light
of day  
  and only now i see
how the time ran away  
  yesterday  when i was young  
  so many lovers  songs  
  were waiting to be sung  
  so many wild pleasures
lay in store for me  
  and so much pain
my eyes refused to see  
  there are so many songs in me
that won t be sung  
  i feel a bitter taste of tears
upon my tongue  
  the time has come  
  for me to pay for yesterday
it s not my fault
you make me think bad thoughts 
oh  right 
you re so innocent 
i m totally leading you
down a dark path of corruption 
you re right 
if i crash and burn
on my test today 
that s on you 
oh  yeah 
i forgot
you have your psats today 
are you ready 
how can i be ready
with you taking up
all my study time 
ha ha 
you re gonna do awesome 
then maybe we can
celebrate tonight 
can you get away
from the parental units 
i ll have
to make something up 
but you know
how creative i can be 
mom says to get
your ass out of bed 
jesus  knock  please 
oh  my god  i will kill you 
   several
reports of police staying
near the walmart
on grounds mountain
and also near cornell street 
witnesses tell us
the driver calmly exited
the vehicle
just moments before the impact
that police say
killed the child instantly 
and reports that the woman
was in fact the child s mother
could not be verified 
good lord  really 
before breakfast

when you say that 
amazing  i mean 
everything just revolves
around you  doesn t it 
doesn t everyone s world
revolve around themselves 
who else
should it revolve around 
well 
you re part of a family  carly 
and that means
that you love each other
even when
you can t stand each other 
and that you give a shit
even when you don t really give
a shit 
yeah  that makes
a lot of sense  mom 
take your aunt jeannie 
for instance 
i mean  you could have
a new cousin today 
that is a big deal 
and all you can think about is  
you know 
i don t even know
what you re thinking about

we are so over 
 i m dying 
 why do we do it 
killing ourselves
to hold back father time
for what  a few more months 
why do anything  i don t know 
be healthy  i guess 
be healthy  my ass 
it s not about being healthy 
it s about being hot 
and hot  skinny bitch 
is in our rear view mirror 
speak for yourself 
i mean 
don t get me wrong 
look at you 
you re amazing 
but that s not what
keeps your hubby
from chasing
after 17 year olds 
it s state divorce law
that does that shit 
yeah  if it weren t for that
juicy hunk of asada
in the front row 
i would not be keeping up
with this torture 
okay  you know he could
sue you for sexual harassment
for shoving your business
in his face 
are you kidding me 
he is making his way
through that class
like a stomach flu 
i m just hoping
he gets to my row
before i have a massive coronary
and peace out  yo 
your sister 
she s gonna pop one out  huh 
yeah  good luck with that 
god  i need a real drink 
i saw riley changing in front
of the mirror the other day 
and i started to hate her
a little 
she s my daughter 
i should be proud 
but all i could think was 
 one day 
those tits are gonna drop 
you little whore  
 is that wrong 
 that s funny 
 i could have sworn  
 what 
that i got 100
from the atm yesterday 
oh  don t worry
about it  i got this 
yeah 
no  it s just weird 
i don t know
what i could have done with it 
i don t know
about your little angels 
but mine steals from me
every chance she gets 
 no 
 she s a bitch 
does anybody know
what this means 
anyone  bueller  no 
it refers to products designed
with a predetermined 
limited life span 
products that are
literally built to die 
that is  to become unfashionable
or nonfunctional
in a certain amount of time 
 see exhibit a 
 excuse me 
that s actually
the new one 
you are dexterously
missing my point 
and making it at exactly
the same time 
see  the idea is to manipulate
the consumer   
   to constantly want to buy
 the new one 
 yeah  duh 
of course  there s
an argument to be made
in favor of  
what s this  what is it 
  planned obsolescence 
  planned obsolescence 
that s right 
without getting rid of the old 
you might never embrace the new 
the need
to continuously replace 
it forces us
to accelerate progress 
the same thing
can happen in nature 
hold that thought 
yep 
sure 
pe√±a  you need to go
to the office 
where was i 
you were saying how we were
the new and improved version
of last year s class

look  look  at this time 
the last thing we want to do
is disseminate any information
that may not be accurate 
and compound the problem 
is it true
that the murderers
and the victims are related 
can you at least  
some of that information
may be correct  but   
fuck 
come on  dad 
do you have kids  sir 
do you know where they are 
i do 
and i can assure you 
i intend to see them very soon

well  look at you 
look at you 
 two kids 
 i know  ugh  hard to believe 
and you have
 none 
 can t wrap my head around it 
look  you either die single 
or you live long enough
to see yourself become a clich√© 
stupid 
ugh  so it s the best  huh 
it is  but they need you less
and less   
and   
that s sort of
why i m here today 
remember how you said
if ever i want to get back in   
oh  kendall  that was  what 
like  15 years ago 
uh  yeah 
that s the  ever  part 
look 
kendall  you are always
a rock star to me 
but this isn t something you can
just jump back into 
i get it  you re going crazy 
kids 
crazy  wow 
maybe take some classes 
 classes 
 yeah  something fun 
tell me 
oh  my god 
are you sure 
okay  okay 
i ll meet you at the hospital 
yep 
god damn it 
yeah 
like he s gonna stop 
i don t know  we re supposed
to be in class  aren t we 
world war z just broke out
at our school  i m pretty sure
nobody s gonna care
that we left early 
where s the remote  we gotta
find out what s going on 
yo  shit was
fucking retarded 
oh  man  i need to light up 
what we had prayed   
found it 
   was an isolated incident
is apparently far from it 
as multiple reports
are now coming in
of similar attacks
across the country 
we can hardly believe
what we are reporting to you
based on the videos
that are flooding in 
and we want to warn you 
this footage is very graphic 
fucking needed that 
 hey  you want a drink  bitch 
 yeah 
i mean  fuck no 
dude  get in here 
but what we know is this 
 what the fuck 
 multiple incidents
are being reported
of parents attacking   
and  in many cases 
murdering their own children 
riley 
mom 
are you okay 
i spilled my drink 
i m sure
many viewers are unfamiliar
with a phenomenon
known as  savaging  
it s actually somewhat common
in the animal kingdom 
for instance 
in a domestic pig population 
as anyone involved in raising
livestock will tell you  
excuse me 
you are talking about pigs 
there are children dying 
and you re talking about pigs 
well  yes  in fact 
around 50 percent
of the piglet fatalities seen
is due to the mother attacking
or crushing
the newborn pre weaned babies 
and no one can say
exactly why they do it 
again  we have
to emphasize  we have no idea
what set off the incidents 
and authorities
have so far refused
to issue any statement 
all we know is what we are   
riley 
riley  i swear to god 
if you re messing with me 
i ll kill you 
hey  kiddo 
dr  torres 
please dial   
all right 
but isn t it a fact
that we still have no real idea
what is causing this 
it could be
a natural phenomenon 
but let s just postulate
someone wants to wipe us out 
so they create
a biological weapon
or a neurotoxin which attacks
a very hard wired human impulse 
which is to protect our young 
any parent would rush out
in front of a speeding car 
or an oncoming train
or even a wild animal
to save their child 
but if you could take
that natural human impulse
and reverse it 
you wouldn t have
to wipe us out 
because at that point 
we ourselves
would be wiping out
our own future 
kendall 
oh  jeannie 
it s about time  woman 
 damn 
 are you the father 
 no  i m the  
 no  he s the boyfriend 
it s complicated  dan the man

i know this hurts  mama 
but trust me 
the second you see
that beautiful baby
and hear that voice 
everything will just disappear 
it s some kind of magic 
okay  trust me 
it will go away 
it s probably
just the drugs kicking in 
no  no  jeannie 
it s something else 
it s   it s love kicking in 
okay  so just let it come 
and push

bright future  everything
in the world to look forward to 
i mean  i was gonna grab
the world by the balls
and squeeze  boy 
god damn it  i remember
that kid i used to be
like it was
four fucking minutes ago 
my feet barely touched
the ground back then 
my kill ratio
was nine out of ten 
it was 100 percent sex 
but that guy  in a million years
could never have pictured
this tired motherfucker
he turned out to be 
flat on his ass 
fat  bald 
cottage cheese fucking ass 
blue bonnet butter
waistline 
with hair coming out
of my ears  my nose 
and my salary went
from 145 000 dollars
to 45 000 dollars 
yeah  building
a fucking man cave 
that s right 
you re right 
i mean 
does any of this make any sense
to you at all 
of course it does 
i mean   
it s not that   
as a woman   
you don t have   
career dreams 
relationship dreams 
i did  i had all that   
but there s this bigger thing 
all your life 
you know it s coming 
and there s this mix
of anxiety and   
secret excitement   
and terror   
because you know that one day   
inevitably   
you ll create this life 
the hugeness of it 
the importance of it   
everything is building
to that moment 
and then   
it happens 
and no matter what you thought
it would be   
it s not like that 
i mean  it s intense 
it s fucking bat shit 
but it s not   
it doesn t   
anyways  it is what it is 
just something that happens 
and then it s   
then it s over 
yeah 
i know this is the way
things are supposed to be 
i   i know we re doing it right 
it s just hard to get
my head around  you know 
i mean  i used to be brent   
and you used to be kendall   
and now we re just   
mom and dad

the origin of threat
is still being determined 
but what we are being told
by authorities
is that we are under attack 
to anyone
in earshot of this broadcast 
the message is  you are going
to want to go to them 
it s your natural instinct
in the middle of a crisis 
is to protect them 
but do not go

right off the line 
used his v a  settlement 
man  that car was his baby 
when i was little 
i used to watch him
polish it on the front lawn
every weekend 
and by the time i turned
into a dumb 
horny  pimple faced
high school kid
just like you re gonna be 
it was officially a classic 
so long story short 
i stole the keys 
picked up my girlfriend

this is before i met your mom 
took it out for a little spin 
pretty much totaled
the motherfucker

well  mel didn t think so 
i thought
he was gonna crush my skull 
but you know what he did 
he sold it to me 
and it wasn t cheap either 
i d have to pay him back
every dime he put into it 
and if i wanted
to drive my senior year 
i better learn how to fix a car 
so i did 
i spent the whole summer
working two jobs 
paid back my dad 
 here s ten dollars  dad 
here s 20 dollars  dad 
here s 100 dollars  dad  
by the end of the summer 
i had that bad boy cherried out
from the ground up 
now  you talk
about a pussy magnet 
  dad

your mom keeps telling me
to sell it 
but i just can t bear
to let her go

because of the accident
