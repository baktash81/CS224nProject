the most destructive kind
yesterday when i was young
the taste of life was sweet
as rain upon my tongue
id teased at life
as if it were a foolish game
the way the evening breeze
may tease a candle flame
the thousand dreams
i dreamed
the splendid things
i planned
i always built to last
on weak and shifting sand
i lived by night
and shunned the naked light
of day
and only now i see
how the time ran away
yesterday when i was young
so many lovers songs
were waiting to be sung
so many wild pleasures
lay in store for me
and so much pain
my eyes refused to see
there are so many songs in me
that wont be sung
i feel a bitter taste of tears
upon my tongue
the time has come
for me to pay for yesterday
its not my fault
you make me think bad thoughts
oh right
youre so innocent
im totally leading you
down a dark path of corruption
youre right
if i crash and burn
on my test today
thats on you
oh yeah
i forgot
you have your psats today
are you ready
how can i be ready
with you taking up
all my study time
haha

celebrate tonight

from the parental units

to make something up
but you know
how creative i can be
mom says to get
your ass out of bed
jesus knock please
oh my god i will kill you
several
reports of police staying
near the walmart
on grounds mountain
and also near cornell street
witnesses tell us
the driver calmly exited
the vehicle
just moments before the impact
that police say
killed the child instantly
and reports that the woman
was in fact the childs mother
could not be verified
good lord really
before breakfast
oh sorry ms ryan

before i have a massive coronary
and peace out yo

yeah good luck with that
god i need a real drink
i saw riley changing in front

thats funny
i could have sworn
what
that i got 100
from the atm yesterday

i dont know
what i could have done with it
i dont know
about your little angels
but mine steals from me
every chance she gets
no
shes a bitch
does anybody know
what this means
anyone bueller no
it refers to products designed
with a predetermined
limited life span
products that are
literally built to die
that is to become unfashionable
or nonfunctional
in a certain amount of time
see exhibit a
excuse me
thats actually
the new one
you are dexterously
missing my point
and making it at exactly
the same time
see the idea is to manipulate
the consumer
to constantly want to buy
the new one
yeah duh
of course theres
an argument to be made
in favor of
whats this what is it
planned obsolescence
planned obsolescence
thats right
without getting rid of the old
you might never embrace the new
the need
to continuously replace
it forces us
to accelerate progress
the same thing
can happen in nature
hold that thought
yep
sure
peña you need to go
to the office
where was i
you were saying how we were
the new and improved version
of last years class

yep
god damn it
yeah
like hes gonna stop
i dont know were supposed
to be in class arent we
world war z just broke out
at our school im pretty sure
nobodys gonna care
that we left early
wheres the remote we gotta
find out whats going on
yo shit was
fucking retarded
oh man i need to light up
what we had prayed
found it
was an isolated incident
is apparently far from it
as multiple reports
are now coming in
of similar attacks
across the country
we can hardly believe
what we are reporting to you
based on the videos
that are flooding in
and we want to warn you
this footage is very graphic
fucking needed that
hey you want a drink bitch
yeah
i mean fuck no
dude get in here
but what we know is this
what the fuck
multiple incidents
are being reported
of parents attacking
and in many cases
murdering their own children
riley
mom
are you okay
i spilled my drink
im sure
many viewers are unfamiliar
with a phenomenon
known as savaging
its actually somewhat common
in the animal kingdom
for instance
in a domestic pig population
as anyone involved in raising
livestock will tell you
excuse me
you are talking about pigs
there are children dying
and youre talking about pigs
well yes in fact
around 50 percent
of the piglet fatalities seen
is due to the mother attacking
or crushing
the newborn preweaned babies
and no one can say
exactly why they do it
again we have
to emphasize we have no idea
what set off the incidents
and authorities
have so far refused
to issue any statement
all we know is what we are
riley
riley i swear to god
if youre messing with me
ill kill you
hey kiddo
dr torres
please dial
all right
but isnt it a fact
that we still have no real idea
what is causing this
it could be
a natural phenomenon
but lets just postulate
someone wants to wipe us out
so they create
a biological weapon
or a neurotoxin which attacks
a very hardwired human impulse
which is to protect our young
any parent would rush out
in front of a speeding car
or an oncoming train
or even a wild animal
to save their child
but if you could take
that natural human impulse
and reverse it
you wouldnt have
to wipe us out
because at that point
we ourselves
would be wiping out
our own future
kendall
oh jeannie
its about time woman
damn
are you the father
no im the
no hes the boyfriend
its complicated dan the man
i hope you remembered
to bring your camera
motherfucker
i cant do this i cant

80 percent dilated

the second you see
that beautiful baby
and hear that voice
everything will just disappear
its some kind of magic
okay trust me
it will go away
its probably
just the drugs kicking in
no no jeannie
its something else
its its love kicking in
okay so just let it come
and push
do you mind do you mind
are you getting this
get this
good job mama

jesus christ
why do you sneak up on me
like that
you bought a pool table
yeah so
you dont even like pool
can i ask how much this cost
dont worry about it
i kind of have to worry
about it
i mean
christmas is coming up
do you really think
this is the right time
to start building a man cave
in the basement
its not a man cave kendall
jesus
i just thought you know
like like a family room
the whole house
is a family room
okay you see i got a problem
with that one right there
because i bust my ass six days
a week
trying to pay this place down
and its like
a fucking obstacle course
trying to get out
the fucking front door
i mean one of these days
im gonna trip over
one of joshs toys
and take a nose dive
straight to the emergency room
what are you saying
im saying that maybe we need
to have boundaries
im saying that
maybe there needs to be
a fucking grownup zone
and a fucking kid zone
brent honey
you think i want to be the one
to piss all over
your family room
do you think
i want to be the one
who has to build
a fucking family room
perfect yeah
okay well
let me see if i can take care
of this for you sweetheart
yeah i think i have something
i have just the right thing
oh yeah
you put your right foot in
you take your right foot out
you do the hokeypokey
and you fuckin
work it all out
brent stop
and you do the hokeypokey
and you turn yourself around
thats what its all about
there you go
problem solved
youre right honey
i hate pool
not a big fan
of machinepart sales either
trying to hit quotas
down there be a big man
not exactly what i had in mind
as a young dude you know
bright future everything
in the world to look forward to
i mean i was gonna grab
the world by the balls
and squeeze boy
god damn it i remember
that kid i used to be
like it was
four fucking minutes ago
my feet barely touched
the ground back then
my kill ratio
was nine out of ten
it was 100 percent sex
but that guy in a million years
could never have pictured
this tired motherfucker
he turned out to be
flat on his ass
fat bald
cottagecheese fucking ass
blue bonnet butter
waistline
with hair coming out
of my ears my nose
and my salary went
from 145000 dollars
to 45000 dollars
yeah building
a fucking man cave
thats right
youre right
i mean
does any of this make any sense
to you at all
of course it does
i mean
its not that
as a woman
you dont have
career dreams
relationship dreams
i did i had all that
but theres this bigger thing
all your life
you know its coming
and theres this mix
of anxiety and
secret excitement
and terror
because you know that one day
inevitably
youll create this life
the hugeness of it
the importance of it
everything is building
to that moment
and then
it happens
and no matter what you thought
it would be
its not like that
i mean its intense
its fucking batshit
but its not
it doesnt
anyways it is what it is
just something that happens
and then its
then its over
yeah
i know this is the way
things are supposed to be
i i know were doing it right
its just hard to get
my head around you know
i mean i used to be brent
and you used to be kendall
and now were just
mom and dad
fuck
come on
the origin of threat
is still being determined
but what we are being told
by authorities
is that we are under attack
to anyone
in earshot of this broadcast
the message is you are going
to want to go to them
its your natural instinct
in the middle of a crisis
is to protect them
but do not go
near your children
