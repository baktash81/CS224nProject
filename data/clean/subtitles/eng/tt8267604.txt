then i got pregnant
and i left
you got what
i got pregnant and left
you speak arabic well
you understand what im saying
yes i understand
so no need for a translator
no
so you left so the lady
wouldnt find out
i was scared of police
theyd take my son and expel me
i was scared
so i didnt tell anyone
so youd leave yonas with zain
when you came home
he had taken good care of him
you never imagined
he could hurt him
maybe the first 2 days
but afterwards
i started to trust him
did you expect zain
to do what he did
never
they were like brothers
i never blamed zain
because i know aspro
who is aspro

how old was she when you married
11
11 years old
is an 11 year old of age to marry
she knows what marriage means
from what i know
yes she can
i mean she had ripened
really
didnt know she was a tomato
or potato to become ripe
zain calm down
i didnt know she could die from it
many girls here marry at that age
even my stepmother
married at that age
shes here still alive
when did she get pregnant
2 or 3 months after
everything was normal
at first i didnt notice anything wrong
then she started to bleed
she bled a lot
what happened next
they brought her to hospital
with her parents
she died at the entrance
we couldnt get her admitted
why did they refuse to admit her
because she has no papers
thats enough youre
besieging her with questions
ive been a slave all my life
and you dare question me
how dare you judge me
have you walked in my shoes
have you lived what ive lived
no never
youll never have to go through it
not even in your worst nightmares
in my place
you would have hung yourself
imagine feeding your kids sugar water
because you have nothing else
id commit 100 crimes
to keep my children alive
theyre my children
nobody has a right to judge me
i am my own judge
the flesh of my flesh
do you hear me
the syrian hussein
the egyptian mohammad
could we have your attention
were here with the priest
to get to know you
to have some good times with you
to help pick up your spirits
lets sing a song

and report to the office

on your television set
ive watched your show
for a while now

congratulations your mourning is over
no longer wearing black
i brought you candy to munch on

why do you hate me so much
im powerless
i couldnt do anything
she was my daughter
its my pain
why are you here
when god takes something
he offers something in return
what did he offer you
im pregnant
youll have a brother or sister
i feel sick
i hope its a girl
well name her zahar
your words pierce my heart
when you get out
shell be walking and playing
i no longer want to see you
youre heartless
leave me alone i want to leave
since my father died
i havent smiled
this report on injustices
against children
has deeply touched
our audience

i want to make a complaint
against my parents
hey boys
zain is on television
zain youre on live
what would you like to say
id want adults to listen to me
i want adults who cant
raise kids not to have any
what will i remember
violence insults or beatings
hit with chains pipes or a belt
the kindest words i heard
were get out son of a whore
bug off piece of garbage
life is a pile of shit
not worth more than my shoe
i live in hell here
i burn like rotting meat
how are you
life is a bitch
i thought wed become good people
loved by all
but god doesnt
want that for us
hed rather we be washrags for others
the child youre carrying
will be like i am
zain what do you want
from you parents
i want them to stop having kids
louder
i want them to stop having kids
you want them to stop having kids
yes
i dont think theyll have more kids
and the one in her tummy

weve discovered a depot
where 15 people were sequestered
toes on the line

but this is my right
and this is my left
lift your chin
look straight ahead
smile
smile zain
