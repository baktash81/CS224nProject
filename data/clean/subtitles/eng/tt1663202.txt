amen 
when the morning was clear    
amen 
ready 
do not move 
where did you learn that 
my father was a doctor 
  bridger    captain we
a small group following us    
    waiting to finish the job 
  hold there 
  if 
tell me you have some kind of plan 
glass 
the missouri is not good 
there is still water running in it 
we must get off this boat    
do you want to get off the boat 
and what are we going to do 
we furs    
    and we sat there on the tail 
like a bunch of damn dogs 
the safest thing to do
is charting a new course    
    back to earth 
prepare the trip 
best sinking now 
being caught those idiots 
already they have eyes on you
right now  son 
i say we follow in the pot 
put the course heading to fort    
    and risk for water 
glass knows the territory better
the rest of us together 
their job is to bring them safely home 
  take me home safely 
  if 
should i remind you and
we lost 32 men 
33 already 
they were my men
fitzgerald  is how many lost 
we do what we said glass  order this 
we must release the boat 
if we track  what
hallaran the end of the river 
the best course is
scalar field    
    to fort kahowa 
  come on 
  insurance 
a week before arriving there 
unless we change
something for horses 
i know a place
where you can do that 
well  captain 
losing the boat  it is a damn error 
besides the red indians are not stupid    
if we keep it  we can
down across the peaks 
you act like you know of
which you speak fitzgerald 
nobody s talking to you 
they do not listen anyway 
i can not believe i have
to put this shit    
everything i say    
    there is a camp road    
and we can hang in there 
we walk 
yeah  sure we will 
demons can not believe there
know how to do their job of captain 
this is what we do now    
hide packages in
rocks when we    
      pick 
  be sure to mark the place 
we left a fortune on these rocks 
no more room here  we
move to the hills 
glass  charts a course    
the narrowest possible
take us near the stream 
yes sir 
this is not ok 
we all know that this forest does not
it will be here when we return 
there is no way we can
take them all the way    
    back to the fort 
not the way we go 
    it is also a great risk    
    we are in their territory 
we ll want your hands free 
i try to tell him
i will not lose these pelts 
you want to stay with
pelts or your life 
life 
what life is this  i have no life 
i have just as freedom and
get is with these pelts 
damn 
jala 
no way  i m going home    
i ve been breaking my 6 months
as mule back 
ripeltg my neck    
    men dying and why 
almost we lose everything 
the work was
fucked from the start 
we are well screwed 
and you guys want
leave it here    
    because mr  glass here 
it is supposed to
fix the damn things 
  because he knows a lot of hills 
  you know more than us 
if 
and that thing 
he brought his son    
and it looks like a wild 
if you ask me 
he leaves his son alone 
just saying 
they are wild wild        
hey glass 
is it true what they say 
they shot a lieutenant    
    while living among savages 
fitzgerald 
21 dead soldiers and
most others in indian    
    but you and your son were the
unique to walk out alive 
it s like a miracle  is not it 
shut fitzgerald 
is that you 
to shoot one of your own
to save this dog here 
  shut 
  you want to fight child 
you were playing with the boy s mother 
  fitzgerald

hours that remain light 
we must keep these pelts

 survive keep closed

we could not continue down the river 
we had flanked 
if we continue east on

the time comes  he earned 
it is understood 
 can you hear the wind  father

 wind mother used to say  
 the wind can not beat 
 to a tree with strong roots  
 you still breathe     
 the strange lot  
 i ll be right here     
 i m right here  
 while you can still hold 
 a breath  still fighting  
 breathe  keep breathing  
 when there is a storm     
 and you re standing in front of a tree 
 if you see the branches  
 you swear to be down     
 but if you see the trunk  
you notice stability  
  300 is something not negligible    
i will go to texas  buy a
decent piece of land    
    and i will begin to urinate into the wild 
i leave this godforsaken place 
are the reds you do that 
i only ask

  i do not know

they put some order around here 
these indians are never
as dead as you think

we have horses here 
come on 
we have horses 
we must catch them    
go down the side kid 
you want to die son 
you are in the right place 
i suppose 
  i can not help but think if we    
  do not 
no place to ask 
the good lord puts us in the
way  so not have chosen 
my father was a religious man you  you know 
he could grow it 
kill or eat    
    and just it made it without believing
and nothing was all 
and once  he was
hunting hills 
hunting hills    
he met with friends
texans and went hunting 
it was routine  had
done hundreds of times before 
they were three days of slaughter  but the
saturday ended screwed    
somehow at night
he had lost his friends    
    and apart from all    
comanche them    
stolen horses    
   i was hungry 
delirious   
    and he crawled in the mud    
    in a group of trees
in the middle of nowhere    
    gotten into that ocean
shitty   
    and then he found religion 
in that moment   
   he told me   
    who found god 
result   
   what god    
    it was a squirrel 
yes  she met him once    
i found god  he would say 
he sat and talked about    
    his glory and his sublime mercy    
and i shot that son of a bitch    
boy you want to close my eyes 
 i m hurt  
 what happened to you  
 a bear  
a grizzly 
 my men     i left him for dead  
 they killed my son  
 lost my family too  
 the sioux killed my people  
 go south to find more pawnee  
 my heart bleeds     
 but revenge is 
 in the hands of the creator  
 will travel with me     
 your body is rotten  
 you need to heal  
 could die  
if 
there it is 
we did it 
you should be proud of you boy 
yes 
we follow orders    
just we omit the part of the funeral 
do not go down there with problems
of conscience  right 
only we shopped both
we finish hanged 
now  we did what we had to do 
 we had an extra day  so 
 we dig a little deeper     
    put rocks above 
for wild    
    i did nothing to the body 
he was well buried 
  mr   
  the truth is that   
when hawk disappeared was
worried about the savages 
he was ready to go     immediately 
bridger here  asked to stay 
he asked to remain until his death    
    he built at least
the cross with something    
    and he puts it over the grave
glass  and gave him what he wanted    
  that s what we did 
  happy to stay mr  bridger 
i know he would 
more importantly captain  this
man here is my partner 
all right 
should i assume that our
treatment has not changed 
to my fortune not 
thank you 
for his courage  honor    
      and services 
  if 
deal or no deal with mr bridger

thank you 
the boy has torn all the way 
we all saw the way it was
glass  could not do more  right

we all saw 
why you not make it 
immediately 
it comes at a time 
 when there is a storm     
 and you re standing in front of a tree     
 if you see the branches  
 swear to be down     
 but if you see the trunk  
 notice stability  
 wild are all 
 there are traces of a camp     
 there are traces of a camp     
 where 
 entering the forest moon  
 maybe two days 
 away  they move to the east  
 tell other  
 move fast

you pay per carry 
the pelts we collect
they are still out there

i hope captain leavenworth
arrives with his army    
and then have the
enough men    
    to get back out there and
show civilization    
    those damn reds 
and restore our pelt 
well well 
and now when it
that supposed to happen 
i do not know but   
    until then nobody gets paid 
listen  okay 
it was hard to get    
we all worked hard    
as i see it    
it has a safe 
  full of money 
  you signed a contract 
to protect your head and
the ownership of your head 
and in my safe it is no longer full 
  300 falls short

according to my
cash registers    
with what you missed in the expedition

  fitzgerald lied    
    he was only following orders 
he was not there when fitzgerald
stabbed to kill my son 
that was what happened  he killed hawk 
i need a horse and a gun 
no  you need to rest and something to eat 
  i m going after him 
  you don t 
  you will not find him without me 
  i do not expect him escaped till dawn 
he will not 
afraid 
you know how far i came 
with fear  he believes he ll be fine 
in the forest   
i ll catch him there  just    
  he does not know yet 
  how can you be so sure 
i have nothing to lose 
all i had was that guy    
    and he he took me 
i can not let you go back out there 
  not again 
  do not 
now i m not afraid of dying anymore 
already did 
i m with you 
they are horse trails  yes 
there is no way to continue overnight 
how far ahead 
  middle maximum day 
  could be the reds 
if not him  we lose 
it is realistic and
will justify killing again 
his fingerprints are right here 
come on 
 i can t remember the face of my wife  
 last week it was still with me  
 now is not  
i do worry not to recognize 
when i come back home 
is it true that you killed an officer 
i just killed a man
he tried to kill my son 
  smoke 
  how close 
no more kilometer
means that route 
i ll go west and you see the east    
  we ll see if we find some traces 
  what if the reds are 
if you are the reds  you turn
immediately to be here 
listen 
i did not expect to see a
man of his status    
fort     so far  when    
    so cold this morning
captain  are you lost 
i m here to take
back to fort kahowa 
where you will be taken to
murder trial 
yes sir 
i m not crazy plan 
also  i have one of your own 
glass had a deal 
i tried to tell your kid  if 
try telling what happened 
but he did not listen    
and still he is screaming 
he would draw all 
you and i   
    had a deal 
i do not know what happened out there 
but i owe my soul to the lord 
lord knows what happened out there 
no deal 
you killed my son 
maybe you should have
raised a man    
    instead of a small screaming bitch 
dammit 
you came all this way
just for your revenge 
is the enjoyed glass
