today president clinton voiced concerns
at the deteriorating situation in sarajevo    
when people ask me  good listeners 
why do i hate all the tutsi 
i say   read our history  
the tutsi were collaborators
for the belgian colonists 
they stole our hutu land 
they whipped us 
now they have come back 
these tutsi rebels 
they are cockroaches 
they are murderers 
rwanda is our hutu land 
we are the majority 
they are a minority of traitors
and invaders 
we will squash the infestation 
we will wipe out the rpf rebels 
this is rtlm  hutu power radio

  what 
  there are soldiers 
  where 
  on the street 
i ll go see what s happening 
it s all right 
  we know you are tutsi 
  please  sir  this is my husband 
  he s just a gardener 
  he s been spying for the rebels 
  no  we do not know any rebels 
  you will come with us 
no  we are telling the truth 
we do not know any    
  what is it 
  shut up 
tatiana  go back in the house 
you must go back 
  you mustn t be out here 
  it s victor 
it s not me  it s not me 
captain  captain 
why are you taking him away 
please  please 
  i know  i know  but it s not me 
  you tutsi fuckers 
no  no 
we must do something 
  do what 
  call someone 
i m not going  i m not going 
no 
get him in the truck  now 
we must do something 
please help him 
oh  victor 
victor 
there is nothing we can do 
  you must stay the night  thomas 
  yes 
no 
why would they arrest victor 
he has no politics 
  he s a gardener 
  who knows  tatsi 
who knows 
someone who didn t like him
denounced him as a rebel spy 
happens all the time now 
maybe you could call
one of your contacts in the army 
it wouldn t help 
you could ask as a favour 
no  i could not 
tatsi  all day long i work
to please this officer 
that diplomat  some tourist 
to store up favours
so if there is a time
when we need help 
i have powerful people
i can call upon 
but victor was a good neighbor 
he is not family 
family is all that matters 
please  please 
leave these things to my good judgment 
this assignment is bullshit 
come on  a few days in a nice hotel 
no one shooting at us 
gentlemen  welcome
to the mille collines 
i am paul rusesabagina 
the house manager 
  how you doing 
  nice to meet you 
anything that you need 
please find me 
  thank you 
  certainly 
so  what is the actual difference
between a hutu and a tutsi 
according to the belgian colonists 
the tutsis are taller and more elegant 
it was the belgians
that created the division 
how 
they picked people 
those with thinner noses  lighter skin 
they used to measure
the width of people s noses 
the belgians used the tutsis
to run the country 
then when they left 
they left the power to the hutus 
and of course the hutus
took revenge
on the elite tutsis
for years of repression 
am i telling the truth  paul 
yes  unfortunately 
please take this to the general 
benedict is our finest journalist
in kigali  an expert on the subject 
so what are you  paul 
i am hutu 
gentlemen 
  more champagne 
  more champagne would be nice 
excuse me  honey 
can i ask you a personal question 
  are you a hutu or a tutsi 
  i am tutsi 
  and your friend  tutsi 
  no  i am hutu 
they could be twins 
get the camera 
the general s going to give us an interview 
okay 
i m in room 22  i d love
to finish up this conversation 
senior u n  officers claim that
the rwandan army is secretly training
and arming the hutu militia
called the interahamwe 
i put this claim to the head
of the armed forces  gereral bizimungu 
no  no  we have not been
training the militia 
the u n  are mistaken
in this accusation 
do you support your president s
agreement to make peace with the rebels 
the president has
the full support of the army 
that peace agreement will
be signed today in tanzania
between tutsi rebel forces
and president habyanimara 
this is a great day for rwanda
and for all of africa 
negotiation has replaced confrontation    
paul  have a drink 
friendship has replaced fear 
ladies and gentlemen 
we have a live feed
to the signing
of the peace agreement 
to our president 
may he find peace 
may we all find peace 
let us all dedicate ourselves
to nurturing this hard earned accord 
to peace 
peace

the house manager 
i met you on your last visit here 
mr  tillens 
ah  yes  paul  i remember 
how are things there 
the situation is difficult  sir 
some of our directors believe
we should close the mille collines
until this unrest is over 
i m not sure about that  paul 
what do you think 
sir  that would be
very bad for our reputation 
the mille collines is an oasis of calm
for all our loyal customers 
what would they think
if sabena deserted them now 
i assure you  the united nations
have everything under control  sir 
very well  paul 
very well 
but if this thing gets worse 
we must close 
if there is anything
i can do  please call 
sir  yes  there is one thing i m going
to be needing from you right away 
let me tell you  it was an embarrassment
for me to have to ask for this 
most of us in this room have known each
other and worked together for many years 
is it really necessary
for me to get a letter from belgium
for you to perform your duties 
in fact  forget this letter 
if you don t want to work for me and would
rather be out there  then leave now 
please  everyone  back to work 
paul  thank you for coming 
the air conditioner s on the blink  is
there any way you can have a look at it 
  i m just on a deadline 
  certainly 
fred  let me know when you
get the satellite feed  thanks 
mr  fleming  i brought you
some tea as well  sir 
thank you  paul 
you re an oasis in the desert 
    the elements of
the government and army
are following the example of what
happened to the americans in somalia 
i think they intend to intimidate us 
try to attack us  and    
hope that the west
will pull all its troops out 
  do you think they ll succeed 
  no  they won t 
the u n  s here to stay 
what about
the outbreak of violence
since the shooting down
of the president s plane 
what the hell
do you think you re doing 
i m responsible
for the safety of this crew 
what is this 
  where did you get this 
  half a mile down the road 
fred  it s david 
i ve got incredible footage 
it s a massacre 
dead bodies  machetes 
if i get this through right away 
can you make the evening news 
yeah 
you have to lead with this 
i point at you  you do a shot 
and you ll get a total double
and see if all the drinking    
  excuse me  mr  daglish 
  hey  paul 
listen  sorry about earlier 
if i d known you were in there 
i wouldn t have    
i am glad that you have shot this footage
and that the world will see it 
it is the only way we have
a chance that people might intervene 
yeah  and if no one intervenes 
is it still a good thing to show 
how can they not intervene
when they witness such atrocities 
i think if people see this footage    
    they ll say   oh  my god 
that s horrible  
and then go on
eating their dinners 
what the hell do i know 
listen  you wanna just relax 
i have more work to do 
i thank you for your offer 
please enjoy your evening 
mr  daglish

i ll remember you 
i ll remember you 
  let s go 
  come on  we re leaving 
they ve gone 
paul  paul 
i was afraid for you 
sir  the president of sabena
is on the phone for you 
i must talk with this man 
  mr  tillens 
  paul  what s going on 
they left  thank you  sir 
what did you do 
i got through to the french
president s office 
well  thank you 
you have saved our lives 
i pleaded with the french and
the belgians to go back and get you all 
i am afraid this is not
going to happen 
they re cowards  paul 
rwanda is not worth
a single vote to any of them 
the french  the british 
the americans 
i am sorry  paul 
thank you 
there will be no rescue    
    no intervention for us 
we can only save ourselves 
many of you know
influential people abroad 
you must call these people 
please  fax this
to this number  thank you 
you must tell them
what will happen to us 
say good bye 
but when you say good bye 
say it as though you are reaching
through the phone and holding their hand 
let them know that
if they let go of that hand    
    you will die 
we must shame them
into sending help 
most importantly 
this cannot be a refugee camp 
the interahamwe believe that the
mille collines is a four star sabena hotel 
that is the only thing
that is keeping us alive 
have you printed the bills 
thank you 
now please erase the register

here is your bill for the last week 
if you cannot pay
or think you will not be able to pay 
please go to the banquet room and
dube will take care of you  thank you 
does the state department
have a view
as to whether on not
what is happening could be genocide 
we have every reason to believe
that acts of genocide have occurred 
how many acts of genocide
does it take to make genocide 
alan  that s just not a question
that i m in a position to answer 
is it true that you
have specific guidance
not to use the word  genocide 
in isolation 
but always to preface it
with this word  acts of  
i have guidance
which i try to use as best as i can 
i have    
there are formulations
that we are using
that we are trying to be
consistent in our use of    
i m sorry it is not glenmorangie 
as long as it is scotch 
your white friends
have abandoned you 
  so it would seem 
  well  don t worry 
  i will take care of you 
  i m glad to hear that
because i was wondering if perhaps
you could spare us a few policemen 
to protect us  sir 
  the police are very busy  paul 
  yes  i m aware of this 
but when i last spoke
to the president of sabena 
he assured me that anyone
who helped protect belgian property
would be well rewarded 
i will see what i can do 
excuse me momentarily  sir 
where has all our beer gone 
sir  gregoire has been taking beer 
how much beer 
many 
    come down to the reception 
and then he says to me 
 how do you want the girls

general    
i m glad you came by 
i overheard something
that i think you should know about 
what did you overhear 
it was a discussion between a u n  colonel
and an american embassy official 
and what did they say 
the american assured the colonel
that they would watch everything 
how  they have gone  paul 
with their spies  satellites 
americans 
oh  gregoire

how do you keep command
of your men amid such madness

a little tip  my friend 
our generals in army say

or they will send
the belgian soldiers back here  
but soon those generals will
have gone and we will be in charge 
it s time to butcher that fat cow
of yours for the meat 
let s go 
maybe you could help us  paul

traitors at that hotel
