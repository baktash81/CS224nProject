this place can be
the promised land for us
and as long as that so aint nothing
i wont do to see it through
you tell them
trudy citizens of redwood
a new day is dawning
as by now you have doubtless learned
the territory will officially
open up for settlement
now they say everything we own
is gonna stay our own
but you know as well as i do
how much thats worth
see your land
your businesses your homes
has all been promised
to the highest bidders
by your onetime sheriff wiley escoe
now mr buck can prevent this
from happening
but in order for us to do that
its necessary that we levy a tax
crowd muttering
at what cost to us
man ooh
you could scrape every penny
from every living soul in this town
and it wouldnt come near to that
you got us between a rock
and a hard place
how long you been alive in this country
a rock and a hard place
is what we call monday
ive heard of rufus buck
how bad a man he is
but he got himself
thrown in jail once before
and i reckon
hell be back there again soon enough
when he is
maybe ill come back to this town
cause i aint paying shit
you think i made redwood for myself
to what end
redwood aint a hiding place
cause i dont hide
it aint a dream
i dont dream
you know what it is

trudy stagecoach mary
ghastly gertrude smith
i prefer treacherous trudy myself
but ill take it
what brings you to my town
i heard rufus buck was back
news travels fast
man chuckles
i have an offer he might wanna hear about
well any offer you got
you can make it to me
chuckles
i dont do business with the help
give me that shit
lead the way treacherous trudy
piano playing
woman singing
mondays child is ever smiling
tuesdays child will play inside
wednesday comes with a gun
thursdays tears have just begun
fridays ships are filled with crying
monday seems so far away now
tuesday was not bad at all
wednesday came with a flame
thursday never be the same
fridays ships are not returning
mondays child is torn asunder
tuesdays child is thrown in chains
wednesdays child used to smile
thursdays tears are now a nile
fridays child is ever burning
singer humming
speak your piece
i assume you know who i am
i assume you know who i used to run with
chuckles
those days are over for me anyhow
but i didnt get to be
stagecoach mary fields
without having my ears to the ground
and my ears tell me you just lost
25 thou that was coming your way
trudy i hope your proposal
rivals your nerve
allow me the latitude of completion
my saloon in douglas is boomin
bought me another one in the elks
and i got a restaurant in cascade too
for the sum of all that
i could take this one off your hands
laughs
the mere mention of my name
brings forth good business
to any establishment attached whereas
with all due respect
but the name rufus buck instils fear
we know who you are
you walkin into my town
with that proposal is risky
the kind of risk a woman such as yourself
wouldnt tie herself to
unless there was
a whole lot more at stake
see i dont believe in coincidence
like you just gonna walk in here
right after the crimson hoods
get ambushed with my money
what are you thinking
mary grunts
man oops
you must have forgot
whose name is on the door
man chuckles
another round
we havin a party yall come on
nat humming
away with the wind she goes
nat all right mary
all right
so you still sayin
you dont know nothin about that money
and you done come here alone
thats right
you done rode all the way over here
to get yourself killed
and for what
for love
love is the only thing worth dying for
but you wouldnt know anything about that
you know
i had a sister named mary
she was pretty strongwilled like you
she died of polio when i was 11
always was in pain
but shed never let me see her cry
mmm
theres this girl called hope lived by us
big fat kid
always picking on the smaller kids
obviously out of jealousy
but she aint never fuck with me though
she hated mary with a passion
always teasing her
about how thin and frail she was
then one day
hope walkin by our house
apple in one hand blade in the other
she decided to throw the apple
across the street at mary
and it hit my sister in the head
and knocked her out of balance
she fell down the steps
broke her ankle
and now that
that was the first and only time
i physically seen my sister cry
and there was hope standing there
laughin her ugly fuckin face off
my daddy
he got home
he took off his belt and he beat me
for not protecting my sister
he lashed me
until my whole body went numb
then
he went to hope house
to do the same thing to her
when he got there he saw her whole family
standin on the side of the house
all of em screamin and cryin
and there was hope
lyin on the floor in a pool of blood
somebody had slit her throat
killed her with her own knife
daddy was speechless
he aint said a word to me
when he came home
the next day
he sent me to live with my grandparents
and then the next time i seen my sister
she was laying in a coffin
disease had killed her
im sorry your sister had to suffer
i admire her bravery
but you get no words from me
you know
i actually admire your bravery
but im afraid the outcome
is still the outcome
hope
must die
mary continues struggling
but not yet
gasping
coughing
breathing heavily
mary grunts
leave her out here in the street
so everybody can see her
no one come to collect her fore sunup
put a bullet in her head
man yes maam

have to wait that long

seems we had a different upbringing
i dont care how you was raised
now pick up your guns and turn around
i used to watch my father
beat my mother to a pulp
if she overcooked his food
he cut her up real good
if she undercooked it too
one day i decided to intervene
and he turned his wrath on me
my father was not a good man
not a good man he was an outlaw
robbin banks
he liked to drink
my mother took a bottle
and cut him to protect me
he lashed back at her
and just like that she was gone
then like the coward he is
he took everything we had and left
leaving me with my
my mother
i was ten years old you know
about the same age you was
when i gave you that scar
i had to fend for myself
but i became who i am
just like you
as i did all i could ever think about is
wanting my father to pay for what he did
i searched for him for years and years
and i could never find him
its like he disappeared
off the face of the earth
i aint stop though i kept looking
until i did find him
one day
lo and behold
there he was
my father
a new man
he was clean now
