 rufus  how do i look 
 trudy  all right 
everybody out there 
just about 
 rufus exhales 
how could you do it 
leave all of this to wiley 
if you were runnin  redwood 
who woulda kept the operation goin  
who else woulda kept
all them gangs in line 
look  i know that wiley got his ways 
but he was loyal once 
loyalty is a virtue  rufus 
till it ain t 
you loyal to me 
see these folk here 
either they can t see it
or they don t want to 
but i believe in what you re doing 
this place can be
the promised land for us 
and as long as that so  ain t nothing
i won t do to see it through 
you tell them 
 trudy  citizens of redwood 
a new day is dawning 
as by now you have doubtless learned 
the territory will officially
open up for settlement 
now they say everything we own
is gonna stay our own 
but you know as well as i do
how much that s worth 
see  your land 
your businesses  your homes
has all been promised
to the highest bidders
by your one time sheriff  wiley escoe 
now  mr  buck can prevent this
from happening 
but in order for us to do that 
it s necessary that we levy a tax 
  crowd muttering 
 at what cost to us 
  50 000 
  man  ooh 
you could scrape every penny
from every living soul in this town 
and it wouldn t come near to that 
you got us between a rock
and a hard place 
how long you been alive in this country 
a rock and a hard place
is what we call monday 
i ve heard of rufus buck 
how bad a man he is 
but he got himself
thrown in jail once before 
and i reckon
he ll be back there again soon enough 
when he is 
maybe i ll come back to this town 
 cause i ain t paying shit 
you think i made redwood for myself 
to what end 
redwood ain t a hiding place 
 cause i don t hide 
it ain t a dream 
i don t dream 
you know what it is 
it s an example 
it s an example 
for others to follow 
and you 
you are an enemy of progress 
 crowd murmuring 
please  please 
 i got a family 
 what s your name 
james 
 crowd gasps 
 body thuds 
 menacing orchestral music playing 
 rufus  rest in peace  james 
 breathes deeply 
now  how much 
how much can be gathered 
ten thousand 
maybe 15 
if every last cent can be squeezed 
 rufus  mmm hmm 
ain t nobody leave town
until we collect it all 
and if you fail to comply 
you and everything you love will burn

rufus came with 12 and took six of mine 
who knows how many he got by now 
i don t believe a thing this man sayin

i say we kill him 
and we take the rest of them teeth 
you ever shot a sheriff  boy 
a mayor 
little harder than shootin  regular folk 
and i m both 
 bass  you both alive and dead
 cause rufus don t like loose ends 
law don t find a man like rufus buck
unless you got inside information 
ain t that right  wiley 
if i had my way  you d be right up
under the jail next to rufus 
but you cut yourself a deal 
wound up wearing a badge instead 
you got your reasons
you want rufus gone  and i got mine 
ain t the enemy of my enemy my friend 
rufus tryin  to save redwood 
but for that  he need money 
and that s one thing he ain t have 
all right  look here 
you made a deal with the devil 
now he come to collect 
you rest up 
but be gone before sunup

 gentle guitar music playing

i assume you know who i used to run with 
 chuckles 
those days are over for me anyhow 
but i didn t get to be
stagecoach mary fields
without having my ears to the ground
and my ears tell me you just lost
25 thou that was coming your way 
 trudy  i hope your proposal
rivals your nerve  
allow me the latitude of completion 
my saloon in douglas is boomin  
bought me another one in the elks 
and i got a restaurant in cascade too 
for the sum of all that 
i could take this one off your hands 
 laughs 
the mere mention of my name
brings forth good business
to any establishment attached  whereas 
with all due respect 
but the name rufus buck instils fear 
we know who you are 
you walkin  into my town
with that proposal is risky 
the kind of risk a woman such as yourself
wouldn t tie herself to
unless there was
a whole lot more at stake 
see  i don t believe in coincidence 
like you just gonna walk in here
right after the crimson hoods
get ambushed with my money 
what are you thinking 
 mary grunts 
 man  oops 
you must have forgot
whose name is on the door 
 man chuckles 
another round 
we havin  a party  y all  come on 
 nat humming
 away with the wind she goes  
 nat  all right  mary 
all right 
so you still sayin 
you don t know nothin  about that money
and you done come here alone 
that s right 
you done rode all the way over here
to get yourself killed 
and for what 
for love 
love is the only thing worth dying for 
but you wouldn t know anything about that 
you know 
i had a sister named mary 
she was pretty  strong willed  like you 
she died of polio when i was 11 
always was in pain 
but she d never let me see her cry 
mmm 
there s this girl called hope lived by us 
big fat kid 
always picking on the smaller kids 
obviously out of jealousy 
but she ain t never fuck with me though 
she hated mary with a passion 
always teasing her
about how thin and frail she was 
then one day 
hope walkin  by our house 
apple in one hand  blade in the other 
she decided to throw the apple
across the street at mary 
and it hit my sister in the head
and knocked her out of balance 
she fell down the steps 
broke her ankle 
and now that 
that was the first and only time
i physically seen my sister cry 
and there was hope standing there
laughin  her ugly fuckin  face off 
my daddy 
he got home 
he took off his belt  and he beat me
for not protecting my sister 
he lashed me
until my whole body went numb 
then
he went to hope house
to do the same thing to her 
when he got there  he saw her whole family
standin  on the side of the house 
all of  em screamin  and cryin  
and there was hope 
lyin  on the floor in a pool of blood 
somebody had slit her throat 
killed her with her own knife 
daddy was speechless 
he ain t said a word to me
when he came home 
the next day 
he sent me to live with my grandparents 
and then the next time i seen my sister 
she was laying in a coffin 
disease had killed her 
i m sorry your sister had to suffer 
i admire her bravery 
but you get no words from me 
you know 
i actually admire your bravery 
but i m afraid the outcome
is still the outcome 
hope
must die 
 mary continues struggling 
but not yet 
 gasping 
 coughing 
 breathing heavily 
 mary grunts 
leave her out here in the street
so everybody can see her 
no one come to collect her  fore sunup 
put a bullet in her head 
 man  yes  ma am 
looks like we don t
have to wait that long 
 dub music playing

now  what kind of dumbass saying is that 
you two trying to get shot out here 
nat love  how predictable 
you predict my friend bill pickett
aiming at your bowler cap 
you ll be dead
before your boys get their aim 
and you die right after

 body thuds 
he didn t even have a chance 
you son of a bitch 
 loading gun 
 gun clicks 
you gonna shoot me in the back too 
or cheat the count 
 gunshot 
  blackskin mile  playing 
 gasps 
 cherokee bill coughing 
  i lost my shadow in violent sin  
  never knew the search would be within  
beckwourth was faster 
  drew a picture of my only desire  
  take me back to blackskin mile  
  i thought my karma would be my fate  
  never saw the sun
until it was too late  
  and  oh  
  drew my loneliness
chasing every last high  
  take me back to blackskin mile  
  i never met a madman s soul  
  that i didn t see reflections
of that which i own  
  but i know
there s something better outside  
  so won t you
take me back to blackskin mile   
look after my friend 
 bass  nat 
don t miss 
 song ends 
pick up your guns 
 rufus  i know what it is now 
it s the eyes 
pick  em up  i said 
 breathing shakily 
 rufus  your father 
he was a good man 
he was 
and my mother was a good woman
before you cut  em down 
seems we had a different upbringing 
i don t care how you was raised 
now pick up your guns and turn around 
i used to watch my father
beat my mother to a pulp
if she overcooked his food 
he cut her up real good
if she undercooked it too 
one day  i decided to intervene 
and he turned his wrath on me 
my father was not a good man 
not a good man  he was an outlaw 
robbin  banks 
he liked to drink 
my mother took a bottle
and cut him to protect me 
he lashed back at her 
and just like that  she was gone 
then  like the coward he is 
he took everything we had and left 
leaving me with my 
my mother 
i was ten years old  you know 
about the same age you was 
when i gave you that scar 
i had to fend for myself 
but i became who i am 
just like you 
as i did  all i could ever think about is
wanting my father to pay for what he did 
i searched for him for years and years 
and i could never find him 
it s like he disappeared
off the face of the earth 
i ain t stop though  i kept looking 
until i did find him 
one day 
lo and behold 
there he was 
my father 
a new man 
he was clean now 
 emotional piano music playing 
sober 
man of god 
had a church 
he had a pretty little wife 
and he had a son 
about the age of ten years old 
whose eyes blazed like mine 
 cocks gun 
you re lyin  
you re lyin  
  three and thirty years  opera   playing 
killing our father was retribution  but  
my father 
my mother 
but it weren t enough 
letting you live 
that was the true revenge 
every sin you made  every bank you robbed 
everybody you killed 
i mean  look at you 
you everything he tried to run away from 
buck 
changed his name to  love  
 inhales shakily 
you a buck 
you lyin  
just like me 
 breathes deeply 
just like him 
but you better 
you gonna surpass even me because 
i couldn t kill my brother 
yet here you are about to kill yours 
 sighs  it s time to take your revenge 
nathaniel buck
