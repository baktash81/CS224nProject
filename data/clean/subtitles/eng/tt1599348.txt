we re working to get you
that answer right now 
meaning you don t know

we re looking into it 
the guy goes rogue 
he spends nine years
selling out the agency
to all takers 
to russia  china  iran 
you name it 
the guy is just not
going to prance
into an american consulate
without good reason 
all right  listen up 
everybody off the phone 
tobin frost has
just waltzed his way
into a u s  consulate
in cape town  south africa 
now this man  without question 
is one of the most notorious
traders that we ve got 
errington  call up
his background profile 
tobin frost was
recruited into the agency in 1984 
he tested off the charts in aptitude
for psychological field work 
his first assignment was in
lebanon  in january  1985 
three months later 
he captured and flipped
a high ranking
hezbollah leader 
over the next several years 
frost successfully questioned and
recruited many high value individuals 
he became known as an expert
manipulator of human assets 
and he literally rewrote agency
interrogation protocols 
frost served
in many active theaters 
including libya
from 1995 to 1998 
jordan  1998 to 2000 
during his tenure in jordan 
frost was suspected of leaking
information to mossad 
but nothing was confirmed 
ten years ago  frost went off
the reservation completely 
he currently has no allegiances
and is wanted for espionage
on four continents 
his last known sighting
is hamburg  germany  in 2011 
you know  harlan  we should
interrogate frost now 
sweat him for
everything he s got 
once he s stateside 
we have fewer options 
i have an interrogator in yemen 
can be there in eight hours 
i already have a team in jo burg
that can be there in two 
we ll take frost to the safe
house  interrogate him there 
my people are fully
capable of handling this 
this is tobin frost 
we ll go with jo burg 
okay

anything in play 
yeah  i have assets in
egypt  but they re in deep 
if i pull them out  that would
compromise two years  worth of work 
i can scramble a team
from europe or asia 
but it s going to
take at least 18 hours 
at this point 
weston is all we got 
i need to find out who this
matt weston is  right now 
matthew james weston 
born 02 24 82 to
terry and madeline weston
in port washington  new york 
an assault arrest 
one month after
both parents and
a younger sister
were killed in
a traffic accident
in which his
father s blood alcohol
was twice the legal limit 
yale  degree in economics 
recruited out of yale law 
high marks in analytics
and linguistics at the farm 
excellent in tradecraft skills 
his girlfriend  ana moreau 
is a french national 
he reported them as having
 close and continuing contact  
she s a second year resident in the
oncology department at groote schuur 
get in that car 
she accepted a
position with hotel dieu hospital
in paris  starts in two weeks 
no known political
affiliations  she s clean 
i want you to post a car
outside their apartment 
use back channels 
and get nsa to cross check their telephone
records and their e mails  please 
yes  ma am 
you know  it would be easier
if i knew where we were going 
you just drive  all right 
just drive  middle lane 
all right 
hey  what are you doing 
middle lane 
just drive around 
all right 
i m driving 
nice to know who you re talking to 
what s your name 
you crushed my windpipe 
well  you locked me
in the trunk 
come on  you re not noc  you re
here under your real name 
what is it 
weston  matt 
all right 
how long you been
a safe house keeper 
twelve months 
happy birthday 
cape town 
that s low level detail 
you should have been
out of here by now 
maybe i requested
the assignment 
or maybe langley doesn t trust
you with anything else 
so  what s your plan 
oh  let me guess 
follow protocol 
protocol states that
if your house is crashed 
you do an sdr to make sure
no one s following you 
activate your gps in your go bag 
select another safe house 
you think i m going to
let you just take me in 
i think you need to shut up 
i think you need to consider how your
house was attacked in the first place 
have you done that  matt 
they followed kiefer  they
followed him from the consulate 
and that s how they
found the safe house 
come on  you don t really
believe that  do you 
how did they know i was near the
consulate in the first place 
hmm 
but i like this  you know 
you and me  figuring shit out 
like the hardy boys 
that house was
a secure location 
whoever crashed it
didn t stop by a gas station and ask for
directions to the nearest safe house 
they were invited  someone
told them  matthew 
think about it 
someone you know 
so you better ask yourself 
can you trust your landlord 
go ahead  you re not
going to get in my head 
i already am in your head 
they re going to
isolate you  matt 
they re going to be real
nice to you at first 
they re going to put their arm
around you and tell you things like 
 you did a decent job  son
we ll take it from here  
that s when you know
you re screwed 
forget about me  they re
going to focus on you 
they re going to try and make a
connection between you and i 
so that if this all goes wrong 
they ll have something
to fall back on
in their little
senate hearings 
i m not your
only enemy tonight 
so  it s someone in house 
it s the only way this
thing could ve happened 
we were completely buttoned up 
i want a list of everyone
who knew about this 
backgrounds  affiliations 
particularly any
connections with frost 
every movement right
up until this operation 
your extraction team  how
long had they been together 
my team had been together
six months  why 
well  i m just trying to
get my head around this 
that will do  thank you 
hello

can you do me a favor  can you go
over to the window for a second

can you just take a quick
look out the window 
i want you to see if
there s anyone out there 
are there any cars
that don t belong 
anyone hanging
around out front 
there s a police car 
what s going on 
i m sorry about this 
i know this is a lot 
but we felt like
it would be best
if we didn t go home
as a precaution 
and i agree with him 
i know there s nothing to worry
about  but i agree with him 
i think you should just go to
dena s for a little while 
just for a few hours  and i ll

for a living 
the girl on the phone

maybe it was a guy 
i don t know 
i don t judge 
you can t expect to have a real
relationship in our line of work  matthew 
don t worry  she s not
going to leave you 
see  what happens is  you try
to protect her with lies 
and then it starts to add up 
at the safe house you said that
they d kill me to get to you 
after a while 
even the truth   
why     starts to
sound like a lie 
you have something  you got something
that they want  what is it 
is she a local 
don t worry about her 
what is it 
oh  it is a girl 
you ll keep covering your
tracks  she ll keep believing

sir  we have a thread on what frost
might be doing in cape town 
can you bring up   
alec wade 
fifteen year noc at mi6 
sabotage  counter ambush 
counter ied tactics 
until he blew up an op
in lisbon four years ago
and was put on a desk 
pushing papers 
cape town police found him
shot through the head 
high powered rifle  14
blocks from the consulate 
witnesses placed someone
fitting frost s description
in the car at the time
of the shooting 
and we think  what  that
they were working together 
they ran joint operations
in hamburg in the mid  80s 
frost s last sighting
was in hamburg  2011 
and what are the brits
saying about wade 
officially 
they re saying nothing 
unofficially 
he s been the subject of a
five month internal investigation 
they think he s
been trading intel 
hmm 
so what the hell
did wade leak to frost
that was so important it was
worth killing six of our men 
i want more details from mi6 
call in every chit you got 
yes  sir

an internal investigation
into daniel kiefer

i returned fire
in self defense 
the fact of the matter is 
frost is on the loose 
i ve spent the last

that could lead me to him 
you are to stand down

frost will be gone 
i ve spent 12
months researching
every square inch of this town

him with one of their own 
and crashed a gulf stream

matt 
hey 
how you doing 
i m proud of you 
and what you pulled off 
you re going to make
a hell of a case officer 
where s frost 
he s gone 
place is a wreck 
blood everywhere 
was he injured or   
i guess you know
he killed keller 
no 
i killed keller 
frost killed keller 
he killed linklater  too 
did he talk about anything 
anything he was after 
anything he might have had 
the file 
the file 
the file that you re on 
along with a lot
of other people 
important people 
listen to me 
what would you do
if someone is
watching your every move 
some maybe you re not proud of 
and you will have some you re
not proud of  believe me 
and then tries to
use it against you 
you would do
what you have to do 
you would do
what you have to do 
where s the file 
matt  the file 
where is the file 
you re a dead man 
yeah  a long time now 
frost is here 
let s go 
we got him 
a hell of a job 
you smell that 
pinotage  it s a good grape 
great wine 
local grape 
pinotage is great   
i don t want you
losing this one 
it s worth a lot of money 
you re a good boy  matty 
you know what you are 
hey 
i know what you re not 
you re better than me 
no  it s okay 
just be better than me 
you promise me 
yeah 
well  let s   
let s go 
i just got to get up 
i need to get up 
stay 
stay 
hey   
that s exactly as it happened 
obviously  this situation needs
to be handled with a
certain amount of finesse 
has anybody else
seen this report 
no  sir  not yet 
matt  i m sure this
comes as no surprise 
but parts of this report are going to
have to be altered for national security 
which parts  sir 
well   
david barlow can t
be held responsible
for what happened
to the safe house 
we just don t need the scandal 
but  sir  you and i both know
that  that is just not the truth 
people don t want
the truth any more  matt 
it s too messy 
keeps them up nights 
i ll tell you what i am
willing to do  though 
i think the agency has
grossly underestimated you 
and i m recommending you for a
senior case officer position 
provided you still want it 
that s a generous offer  sir 
there s just one thing you
need to clarify for me 
of course 
frost may have been
carrying some vital intel 
a file 
i m not seeing that
anywhere in this report 
what was on the file  sir 
something that  quite frankly 
could be very damaging
to the agency
and to our allies 
i don t see why frost would even
mention something like that to me 
no  i suppose he wouldn t 
would he 
you realize  though 
that if that file did leak 
what would happen
to the person responsible 
that person would
be arrested  sir 
he d be risking everything 
he d have enemies in every
intelligence agency in the world 
in the eyes of the cia  he d
be just like tobin frost 
frost didn t say anything
about a file  sir 
all right  son 
take a few days off 
we ll get you
started next week 
thank you 
and think about our
conversation  would you 
will do 
i ll take it from here  sir 
   and other media outlets
received a controversial file
from an anonymous source 
the international intelligence
community is still reeling
from the release of so many
highly classified documents
and the revelations of widespread
corruption and criminal activity
at the cia  the bnd  and mi6 
   is in
an uproar over the lack
of oversight given to
british intelligence 
demanding accountability
of the rogue agents 
officials at mi6
are fully cooperating 
chancellor
merkel insists that the bnd
has already identified
the corrupt agents
and contained
the intelligence breach 
she has ensured her
international counterparts   
indictments are
now expected within the week 
and congress has demanded that
deputy director harlan whitford
testify before
a senate subcommittee
