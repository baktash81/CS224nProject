the guy is just not

into an american consulate
without good reason
all right listen up
everybody off the phone
tobin frost has
just waltzed his way
into a us consulate
in cape town south africa
now this man without question
is one of the most notorious
traders that weve got
errington call up
his background profile
tobin frost was
recruited into the agency in 1984
he tested off the charts in aptitude
for psychological field work
his first assignment was in
lebanon in january 1985
three months later
he captured and flipped
a highranking
hezbollah leader
over the next several years
frost successfully questioned and
recruited many highvalue individuals
he became known as an expert
manipulator of human assets
and he literally rewrote agency
interrogation protocols
frost served
in many active theaters
including libya
from 1995 to 1998
jordan 1998 to 2000
during his tenure in jordan
frost was suspected of leaking
information to mossad
but nothing was confirmed
ten years ago frost went off
the reservation completely
he currently has no allegiances
and is wanted for espionage
on four continents
his last known sighting
is hamburg germany in 2011
you know harlan we should
interrogate frost now
sweat him for
everything hes got
once hes stateside
we have fewer options
i have an interrogator in yemen
can be there in eight hours
i already have a team in joburg
that can be there in two
well take frost to the safe
house interrogate him there

capable of handling this

nice to know who youre talking to
whats your name

come on youre not noc youre
here under your real name
what is it
weston matt
all right
how long you been
a safe house keeper
twelve months
happy birthday
cape town
thats lowlevel detail
you should have been
out of here by now
maybe i requested
the assignment
or maybe langley doesnt trust
you with anything else
so whats your plan
oh let me guess
follow protocol
protocol states that
if your house is crashed
you do an sdr to make sure
no ones following you
activate your gps in your gobag
select another safe house
you think im going to
let you just take me in
i think you need to shut up
i think you need to consider how your
house was attacked in the first place
have you done that matt
they followed kiefer they
followed him from the consulate
and thats how they
found the safe house
come on you dont really
believe that do you
how did they know i was near the
consulate in the first place
hmm
but i like this you know
you and me figuring shit out
like the hardy boys
that house was
a secure location
whoever crashed it
didnt stop by a gas station and ask for
directions to the nearest safe house
they were invited someone
told them matthew
think about it
someone you know
so you better ask yourself
can you trust your landlord
go ahead youre not
going to get in my head
i already am in your head
theyre going to
isolate you matt
theyre going to be real
nice to you at first
theyre going to put their arm
around you and tell you things like
you did a decent job son
well take it from here
thats when you know
youre screwed
forget about me theyre
going to focus on you
theyre going to try and make a
connection between you and i
so that if this all goes wrong
theyll have something
to fall back on
in their little
senate hearings
im not your
only enemy tonight
so its someone inhouse
its the only way this
thing couldve happened
we were completely buttoned up
i want a list of everyone
who knew about this
backgrounds affiliations
particularly any
connections with frost
every movement right
up until this operation
your extraction team how
long had they been together
my team had been together
six months why

relationship in our line of work matthew
dont worry shes not
going to leave you
see what happens is you try
to protect her with lies

counteried tactics
until he blew up an op
in lisbon four years ago
and was put on a desk
pushing papers
cape town police found him
shot through the head
highpowered rifle 14
blocks from the consulate
witnesses placed someone
fitting frosts description
in the car at the time
of the shooting
and we think what that
they were working together
they ran joint operations
in hamburg in the mid80s
frosts last sighting
was in hamburg 2011
and what are the brits
saying about wade
officially
theyre saying nothing
unofficially
hes been the subject of a
fivemonth internal investigation
they think hes
been trading intel
hmm
so what the hell
did wade leak to frost
that was so important it was
worth killing six of our men
i want more details from mi6

stopping him from
testifying about wet works
to a congressional hearing

well lets
lets go
i just got to get up
i need to get up
stay
stay
hey
thats exactly as it happened
obviously this situation needs
to be handled with a
certain amount of finesse
has anybody else
seen this report
no sir not yet
matt im sure this
comes as no surprise
but parts of this report are going to
have to be altered for national security
which parts sir
well
david barlow cant
be held responsible
for what happened
to the safe house
we just dont need the scandal
but sir you and i both know
that that is just not the truth
people dont want
the truth any more matt
its too messy
keeps them up nights
ill tell you what i am
willing to do though
i think the agency has
grossly underestimated you
and im recommending you for a
senior case officer position
provided you still want it
thats a generous offer sir
theres just one thing you
need to clarify for me
of course
frost may have been
carrying some vital intel
a file
im not seeing that
anywhere in this report
what was on the file sir
something that quite frankly
could be very damaging
to the agency
and to our allies
i dont see why frost would even
mention something like that to me
no i suppose he wouldnt
would he
you realize though
that if that file did leak
what would happen
to the person responsible
that person would
be arrested sir
hed be risking everything
hed have enemies in every
intelligence agency in the world
in the eyes of the cia hed
be just like tobin frost
frost didnt say anything
about a file sir
all right son
take a few days off
well get you
started next week
thank you
and think about our
conversation would you
will do
ill take it from here sir
and other media outlets
received a controversial file
from an anonymous source
the international intelligence
community is still reeling
from the release of so many
highly classified documents
and the revelations of widespread
corruption and criminal activity
at the cia the bnd and mi6
is in
an uproar over the lack
of oversight given to
british intelligence
demanding accountability
of the rogue agents
officials at mi6
are fully cooperating
chancellor
merkel insists that the bnd
has already identified
the corrupt agents
and contained
the intelligence breach
she has ensured her
international counterparts
indictments are
now expected within the week
and congress has demanded that
deputy director harlan whitford
testify before
a senate subcommittee
