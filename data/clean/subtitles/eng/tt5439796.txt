the asset in this scenario
its not dayton white right
and the simple fact is id
be driving that car myself
if my day job wasnt running
a billion dollar company
you know and by the way it was my
understanding that this is america people
so them trying to muzzle the company
that i created in america
is a violation
of my free speech

kidney to begin with
so why isnt

charlotte motor speedway
the speedway
jimmy its one of the busiest
sports venues in the country
just last year
they had over 300 events
its the official home
of nascar of course
thats all run on
that main track
but that place right there
aint just about racing
this place is like a city
a few years ago they built
condos for people who wanted
to live above the track all year long
they sold out in less than 24 hours
they even got their own
police force and jail
for people carryin on
and getting out of hand
clyde do you hear the words
comin out your mouth
they have their
own police force
im midway
through my presentation
so you can just not interrupt
me and let me get it out
how many times have i listened to that
logan family curse thing of yours
thank you
now as you very well know
the speedway has got a big
problem on its hands right now
a 40yearold pipe burst and since
the whole things built on landfill
its turnin to mush
which causin
all these sinkholes
sinkholes
thats right
the sinkholes in the infield
now they want to fix this thing
up right so what did they do
whatd they do
they called a bunch of us
who used to work
down in them mines

but you were just fired
i was let go for liability
reasons involvin insurance

each concession has its own rig
when a register

mellie well we got a lot
of road to cover so yeah

clyde gunning for 100
in a neon blue car
that probably aint
even on the market yet

for to be pulled over
sunday on a holiday weekend
police department
hit by budget cuts
theres only one musker patrolling the
whole highway for the next 40 miles

i dont have time for this
sighs
step out of the vehicle maam
i am not going to ask you again
this is ridiculous
what did i do
i need you to comply maam
i need your license
your registration
you seen that
seen what
i need you to focus here
this woman needs containing
mike joy its a beautiful day
for racing in the queen city
welcome to the
cocacola 600
this is nascars
greatest distance
and stock car
racings longest night
itll take 400 laps
to complete 600 miles
darrell waltrip
and mike you know
one of the stories
were all gonna be watching is
this guy dayton white as he returns
to racing after a twoyear break
and jeff you certainly know what its
like to get back behind the wheel
after some time off
can we really expect
this guy to run up front
well that truly is
the question dw
and yeah
it is extremely tough
so much has changed since the
last time he was in the car
the cars have changed
the setups have changed
the competitions changed
and you know
you just cant underestimate
the mental focus
and endurance needed
to get back behind the wheel
after this long of a break
well focus
endurance and discipline
could well describe
daytons offtrack routine
we caught up with
him as he prepared
for this highly
anticipated return to racing
dayton theres a team of
people looking after my car
making sure everything
is operating at full capacity
so it makes sense that i do
that for my physical self
because im not just a driver
im an athlete
once i began sourcing
really clean software
i noticed a total difference
in my clarity and performance
softwares what i call my food
because
when you think about it
your body is your
operating system
so when your os may
feel like its working fine
a problem with software can make
your computer not perform properly
even crash
inhaling and exhaling
so eating only clean software
making sure my os
is working at an optimum level
and all this will help me win
indistinct shouting
speed up the drops well
figure the numbers out later
no energy drink on the market
comes in a magnum right
but i had 10 cases of these
babies made just for today
ill have a little now before
the race some during the race
and come lap 600
and that checkered flag
i think were all gonna be finishing
these puppies off in victory huh
you got us all in the shot
me and the car
so ive got this racing suit and
ive got my helmet right here
just want to make sure
you can see that huh
ive been carefully monitoring
my glucose levels
so im really in a sweet spot
right now for sustained energy
youre the to the max driver
you got to drink chuckles
maybe you should think about
those four years of back taxes
that this drink
is paying for huh
man yeah go on
go on
man 2 come on
chuckles lets
drink m
man 3 come on
man 4 come on
drink drink drink
all shouting
man 5 ready boy beware
yeah
all whooping
okay im gonna need some cash
what for
supplies for the job
i thought jimmy
and your brothers
were bringing
everything you needed
yeah no they did i just
need a little contingency
well it looks like
my brothers was successful
you thirsty
no no way
just one come on
no no
we got time come on
hey gorgeous give me one
of those beers will you
you want a second
one for just 10 more
well of course i do
and baby doll

of those gummy bears
warden burns
this is the warden
all right
now i got your
napkin of demands here
of what you want for
peaceful surrender
and the safe release
of my guards
youre holding captive
as warden i can uh
approve buying a copy of
a dance with dragons
for the prison library
to go up on
the game of thrones shelf
all cheering now the
only problem is that uh
the winds of winter and a dream of
spring have yet to be published
so those arent available
all sighing
well i cant do anything
about what i cant control
that is total bullshit
george rr martin was supposed
to deliver the winds of winter
to his publisher
over two years ago
warden burns i know that was
the original deadline
thats what it says here
but pm reading to you
from the wikipedia page
it also says that martin
had a grueling promotion schedule
or something and its interfered
with his writing schedule hes failed
to complete the winds of winter
that dont make no sense
those two guys who transferred
in from federal last month
knew about all the new stuff with
the hot chick and her dragons
warden burns no
im telling you
i believe those two inmates
had that information
from watching the tv series
again im reading to you
the series has jumped ahead
its no longer
following the books
leann rimes singing
o beautiful
for patriot dream
that sees beyond the years
thine alabaster
cities gleam
undimmed by human tears
america
america
god shed
his grace on thee
and crown thy good
with brotherhood
from sea to
shining
sea
cheering and applause
lets blow this thing
mike the pace car is in
and were ready to race
darrell mike its an honor
to be able to start
this 600mile race
here on memorial day
engines roaring
boogity boogity boogity
lets go racing for those
who made
the ultimate sacrifice boys
joe dws talking about you
chuckling
what jimmy leave us
some sort of door key
for us to meet up
something like that
just remember one thing
roll dont hesitate just roll
what are you talking about
whats down there
remember to roll
joe what the fuck
oh come on

tube

bleach pens
fake salt and gummy bears
thats our bomb
dont call it a bomb
now how many yards
away is the vault
about 20 yards
i dont know maybe 30
is it 20 or is it 30
we are dealing
with science here
i guess when i saw
that gummy bears
is our secret
ingredient to our bo
our explosive device
that i wasnt
thinking about science
now you said yourself
we couldnt bring in
normal explosives
cause of the security
now to make our bang
we need potassium chlorate
bleach pens is
pure sodium hypochlorite
combined with the potassium
chloride in the salt substitute
we have created
an equal exchange of ions
sugar plus potassium chlorate
yields
two gasses and
a solid
now you throw in some heat
you get energy
energy means light explosion
or as i like to call it
the joe bang
what you thought
i was going to use
a stick of dynamite
or something
well yeah i kinda did
yeah me too
i just figured youd use
a lot to blow through
the thick steel walls
we dont need to
blow through the wall
them tubes in the
venting system is our in

moved everything around
this whole job
changed dramastically

sam you knew the terms
for our participating
mmmhmm
we needed a moral reason
to pull this job with you
now we was fine with you wanting
to get back at that store
for messing
with your hot sister
but you did a whole 360 on everything
when you moved up the date
and nascar
aint done nothing to nobody
nascar is a beautiful thing

report er on tv authorities have
confirmed they have recovered the money
stolen from
the charlotte motor speedway
in what some are calling
the hillbilly heist
sources say an anonymous caller
led police to this gas station
where they discovered an abandoned
truck containing bags of cash
that have been positively linked
to the robbery over the weekend
police spokesperson the truck
was reported stolen last week
our forensic team
is at work on the scene
and were certain
that they will find
why go to all
the trouble to rob a place
if you dont have the guts
to keep the money
woman
he mustve chickened out
newscaster well we are joined
now by a resident daredevil
at little victory
family shelter
this is josh morrison thank
you for joining us today
right he comes
on about you know
he used to come on a lot on
midday for pet of the week
so hes joining us to talk
about a new adoption challenge
at the shelter for little victories
we do have to talk about the
cal well we brought everyone
in at 600 this morning
couldnt work all weekend you know
cause of the race obviously
but everything was just like
we left it on friday
how many men
do you have working today
well 40 or so
i guess were on
a bit of a tight deadline
cause theyre trying to
get everything shored up
since the seasons starting
well be wrapping
out of here this week
im gonna need prints
from all your guys
well sure but all the workers
have to wear protective
gloves at all times
thats
well its a union rule
union rules
yep
great
agent grayson
local pd got a call from someone
claiming to be an eyewitness
swears they saw the robbers
can definitely identify em
yeah i saw em
i know who they are too
grayson why dont we
start at the beginning
whered you see them
in a tunnel
leading from the track back
to the shower
room and the lockers
man on tv theres
a saying in our business
set it up and shut up
so ill shut up
max on tv
what the hell was that
you call yourself a driver
what youve never been
boxed in a turn before
dayton i told you i didnt
want to drink your poison
i thought i was having
a heart attack
max that poison
hey hey
cant one of you hit mute
im trying to give my
statement to the fbi here
there was two of em right
now one of em was a bartender
from that place out off
of i17 got one arm
the guy with him
i dont know who he was
and you know the bartender from
max a while back
i got in a fight at the bar
with the bartender
max no with his brother
did the brother
have one arm or two
the brothers got both
grayson
and the fight was about
i cant remember
grayson and you won
that fight at the bar
hell yeah i won it
so you saw
the bartender with one arm
and an unknown male companion
in the tunnel during the race
and they were
well they was just walking
but it was suspiciouslike
grayson suspicious how
they shouldnt have been down there
that was suspicious
but you didnt think to mention
this encounter to anyone
until you saw the news on the
television about the robbery
the docs had to set
my nose all right
ive been in recovery
so all these
injuries are the result
of your latest
fight with the brothers
max bartender brother
hes the one that
punched me in the tunnel
the onearm
yeah look just ask
my driver dayton white
right he was with me
when all this went down
hell back up my story
yes when you called in
your tip you mentioned
that hed be able
to corroborate your story
we spoke with
dayton white earlier today
he stated he was never in the
tunnel with you during the race
never saw two suspicious men
and has no idea
what youre talking about
did you talk to him
i think you knows better
mellie i stopped by the
trailer when he wasnt home
i think i got
most of your stuff
you sure love your books
and theres some
mail there too
grayson visitation logs
indicate that jimmy logan
an employee
recently fired
from the speedway
came with his brother clyde
to see joseph bang here
on april 15th
they returned two days later
for a second visit
now we only have video
of this meeting no audio
so we have no idea
what they discussed
but the following week
clyde logan drives through the
window of a corner save mart
and ends up being sentenced
to 90 days here
you seem to have a lot of information
in your fbi folders there
and so
you dont think thats
an incredible coincidence
no not really
i mean if youre asking me am i shocked
that the criminals locked up in here
are friends with other criminals
no im not
so clyde logan and joseph bang
were incarcerated here
at your prison on may the 28th
and you had no problems
no issues of any kind
at your prison on that day
is that right
no we didnt have any problems
right cause monroe
county fire department
said they
dispatched multiple units
around 830 pm that night
there was a small kitchen fire
but thats not a problem
in the context of this prison
i mean its
standard operating procedure
for them to
dispatch multiple units
any time theres
a fire at the prison
that was no big deal it was
out within a few minutes
youre certain
that these two inmates
couldnt have
broken out of here
robbed the speedway and then
broken back into your prison
without you knowing about it
wow chuckles
no
agent grayson ive been warden here for
nine years and i can tell you this
we dont have
an escape problem at monroe
reporter on tv what do you
think of the robbery
woman 1 well i heard that theyre
calling it oceans 7eleven
cause they found that truck with the
money behind a convenience store
woman 2 uh heard that theyre
calling em the redneck robbers
cause they think the guys
who did this whole thing
are from around here
i hope they never catch em
reporter where does
this investigation stand
man well
let me tell you this
even though the crime was
committed in charlotte
the fact that
the money was recovered here
makes it a very serious matter
were involving all
of our local state
you have a problem
with the food here inmate
no no no warden
no problem
reckon your stomachs
not been bothering you lately
no warden no
thank
thank you for asking me
tray clatters
you best be
cleaning up your mess
guard now
sir clears throat
huh
joe grunts
whatd you say to me inmate
go on
thank you
grayson what about the
disgruntled fired employee
the brother of
the onearmed bartender
jimmy logan was fired
six weeks before the robbery
his brother clyde is
the onearmed bartender
max chilblain claims to
have seen during the race
but we know theres
no way clyde logan
could have been in
that underground walkway
because he was serving time at
the monroe correctional facility
on the day of the robbery
hmm
i hate airtight alibis
where did jimmy
logans cell phone
tell us he was during the race
jimmy logan doesnt
have a cell phone
shut off three months
ago for nonpayment
he also drives
a 1983 ford f150
so no gps
no email no social media
we did get a few
hits on his name
on other social media accounts
which place him at valley view
high school during the race
his daughter was competing in the
miss pretty west virginia pageant
and apparently she won
country song
playing on speakers
hows your brother
i wouldnt know
you havent talked to him
nope
not once
nope
scoffs
well it seems
strange you know
you two being so close and all
last i heard he moved south
to be closer to his daughter
exhales
how far south
lynchburg
guess his ex moved down there
when her husband
opened a new car lot
well
if you do speak to him
tell him id
like to talk to him
i doubt ill be talking to him
he never told you why

in our rearview mirror

thank you again
i do have one last question
sure
you just said you received a
payout from your insurance company
for the money that
wasnt recovered
yes thats right
hmm
we were here with forensic
accountants for weeks
poring over the register
logs and receipts
no one here was ever able
to give us an exact accounting
of how much money
was actually stolen
right um its
well its very complex
the algorithm and whatnot
yeah we heard about
the complicated algorithms
so how did you arrive
at the number to ask for
if you didnt know
how much was stolen
im not an accountant so uh i
wasnt in there for those discussions
but as far as all of us here at
charlotte motor speedway are concerned
the matter has been resolved
to our satisfaction

thats why it has
such a silky texture
