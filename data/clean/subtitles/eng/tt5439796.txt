christmas time in 1970 
his opening act was
this husband and wife duo

to go on back to the house
and have a little jam session 
on the way

and john denver 
he broke his thumb 
and when they finally
got back to the house 
and bill and taffy played him 
played john denver this song
they d been working on 
he flipped for it  man 
and they worked on
that thing till dawn 
screwdriver 
flat head or phillips 
flat 
so that s why you like the song 
well  i like the song
because of the song 
i mean  i guess i also like it
 cause it s got
a story behind it 
you know 
bill danoff later said that
he ain t never even
been to west virginia 
well  i like the song  too 
but i don t really think
it ll work for the pageant 
pliers 
regular or needle nose 
needle 
so you comin  to my rehearsal 
yeah  i m gonna pick
you up right after work 
just so you know  i asked mommy
if she and moody would
pay for your cell phone 
she said even if they did 
you wouldn t take it

so 
my leg ain t got nothin  to do

big office  they feel different 
and they said you didn t
list it on your paperwork

no 
they are callin  it
a  pre existing condition 
and that it is
a liability issue 
okay  this big then  what
is that  two to three feet 
this big and you let me drive my
truck around the track tonight

my husband  the major 
when he was still alive 
he loved lsu football 
whenever they d show the games

of course for me 
it was all about the uniforms

striking shade of purple 
purple

royal colors 
yeah  i got off early 
so i figured i d take sadie
on over to her dance thing 
so you didn t have to drive her 
well  that s great and all 
you wanting to see your
daughter dance and everything 
but it was yesterday 
 sighs  shit

charleston  then  duh 
you get on the 85 to danville 
then the i 19
to charleston  54 miles 
but  bein  4 00 p m  
i knew not the best time
of day to be on the road 
and they re still doing
all that shoulder
work on the i 19 
plus  then you got
the sun right in your eyes
for that whole
stretch outside of julian 
so  yeah 
i took the 85 to danville 
but then i hopped onto the 3 
so instead of goin  up and over 
i m goin  over and then up 
and after that it was a straight
shot on the daniel boone parkway
all the way to marmet 
purple lady  well  sure sounds

 music continues 
 door opens 
max  see 
the dirty big secret is
that i am
the asset in this scenario 
it s not dayton white  right 
and the simple fact is i d
be driving that car myself 
if my day job wasn t running
a billion dollar company 
you know  and by the way  it was my
understanding that this is america  people 
so them trying to muzzle the company
that i created  in america 
is a violation
of my free speech 
and plus  plus 
two of those kids
only had one
kidney to begin with 
so  why isn t
anybody writin  about that 
right  it s total b s 
clyde  what do you like

 cauliflower  plans 
my life of crime is over 
but you did make
breakfast this morning 
even burned
the bacon like i like

i also saw you have some
sort of robbery  to do  list 
now  i know this attempt to be
organized is a big step for you 
so go 
charlotte motor speedway 
the speedway 
jimmy  it s one of the busiest
sports venues in the country 
just last year 
they had over 300 events 
it s the official home
of nascar  of course 
that s all run on
that main track 
but that place right there
ain t just about racing 
this place is like a city 
a few years ago  they built
condos for people who wanted
to live above the track all year long 
they sold out in less than 24 hours 
they even got their own
police force and jail
for people carryin  on
and getting out of hand 
clyde  do you hear the words
comin  out your mouth 
 they have their
own police force  
i m midway
through my presentation 
so you can just not interrupt
me and let me get it out 
how many times have i listened to that
logan family curse thing of yours 
thank you 
now  as you very well know 
the speedway has got a big
problem on its hands right now 
a 40 year old pipe burst and since
the whole thing s built on landfill 
it s turnin  to mush 
which causin 
all these sinkholes 
sinkholes 
that s right 
the sinkholes in the infield 
now  they want to fix this thing
up right  so what did they do 
what d they do 
they called a bunch of us
who used to work
down in them mines 
 cause we know the work 
and you do good work 
we do good work 
but you were just fired 
i was let go for liability
reasons involvin  insurance

why you think you can do this

what them  they gas lines 
pneumatic tube transport 
each concession has its own rig 
when a register
starts to fill up 
they can do a money
dump through the ptt 
easy to do  and it don t
interfere with the beer selling 
plus  heck of a lot more secure than
tryin  to pick up cash during a race 
so all them pipes they  what 
they just run right into the   
bobo  to the main vault 
the whole thing is
like a cash highway 
jimmy  i even know

reckless endangerment 
destruction of private property 
i d take your

an accident  that your foot slipped 
these are serious charges 
your previous run ins
with the law were back
when you were
classified as a juvenile
and  of course  in determining
your sentencing   
i m taking into
account your service
and the great sacrifice
you ve made for our country

chance of it breaking down 
earl  you want a camper coverin  the
bed of the truck  or just empty

 engine revving 
 tires screeching

nice 
shut up 
mellie  there s clothes

and  clyde  i put something
special in there for you 
thanks  mel 
you re going pretty fast 
mellie  well  we got a lot
of road to cover so  yeah 
there will be speeding 
clyde  gunning for 100
in a neon blue car
that probably ain t
even on the market yet 
don t you think you re asking
for to be pulled over 
sunday on a holiday weekend 
police department
hit by budget cuts 
there s only one musker patrolling the
whole highway for the next 40 miles 
clyde  but that s
still one musker 
it s been handled 
joe  mellie 
i m about to get naked
back here  so no peeking 
 scoffs 
joe  i said no peeking

 laughing 
jimmy  yes  sir

 sighs 
step out of the vehicle  ma am 
i am not going to ask you again 
this is ridiculous 
what did i do 
i need you to comply  ma am 
i need your license 
your registration   
you seen that 
seen what 
i need you to focus here 
this woman needs containing 
mike joy  it s a beautiful day
for racing in the queen city 
welcome to the
coca cola 600 
this is nascar s
greatest distance
and stock car
racing s longest night 
it ll take 400 laps
to complete 600 miles 
darrell waltrip 
and mike  you know 
one of the stories
we re all gonna be watching is
this guy dayton white  as he returns
to racing after a two year break 
and jeff  you certainly know what it s
like to get back behind the wheel 
after some time off 
can we really expect
this guy to run up front 
well  that truly is
the question  d w 
and  yeah 
it is extremely tough 
so much has changed since the
last time he was in the car 
the cars have changed 
the setups have changed 
the competition s changed 
and you know 
you just can t underestimate
the mental focus
and endurance needed
to get back behind the wheel
after this long of a break 
well  focus 
endurance and discipline
could well describe
dayton s off track routine 
we caught up with
him as he prepared
for this highly
anticipated return to racing 
dayton  there s a team of
people looking after my car 
making sure everything
is operating at full capacity 
so it makes sense that i do
that for my physical self 
because i m not just a driver 
i m an athlete 
once i began sourcing
really clean software 
i noticed a total difference
in my clarity and performance 
software s what i call my food 
because 
when you think about it 
your body is your
operating system 
so when your os may
feel like it s working fine 
a problem with software can make
your computer not perform properly 
even crash 
 inhaling and exhaling 
so eating only clean software 
making sure my os
is working at an optimum level
and all this will help me win 
 indistinct shouting 
speed up the drops  we ll
figure the numbers out later 
no energy drink on the market
comes in a magnum  right 
but i had 10 cases of these
babies made just for today 
i ll have a little now  before
the race  some during the race 
and come lap 600
and that checkered flag 
i think we re all gonna be finishing
these puppies off in victory  huh 
you got us all in the shot 
me and the car 
so i ve got this racing suit and
i ve got my helmet right here 
just want to make sure
you can see that  huh 
i ve been carefully monitoring
my glucose levels 
so i m really in a sweet spot
right now for sustained energy 
you re the to the max driver 
you got to drink   chuckles 
maybe you should think about
those four years of back taxes
that this drink
is paying for  huh 
man  yeah  go on 
go on 
man 2  come on 
 chuckles  let s   
drink m 
man 3  come on 
man 4  come on 
drink  drink  drink 
 all shouting 
man 5  ready  boy  beware 
yeah 
 all whooping 
okay  i m gonna need some cash 
what for 
supplies  for the job 
i thought jimmy
and your brothers
were bringing
everything you needed 
yeah  no  they did  i just
need a little contingency 
well  it looks like
my brothers was successful 
you thirsty 
no  no way 
just one  come on 
no  no 
we got time  come on 
hey  gorgeous  give me one
of those beers  will you 
you want a second
one for just  10 more 
well  of course i do 
and  baby doll 
give me two packs
of those gummy bears 
warden burns 
this is the warden 
all right 
now i got your
napkin of demands here
of what you want for
peaceful surrender
and the safe release
of my guards
you re holding captive 
as warden  i can  uh 
approve buying a copy of
a dance with dragons
for the prison library 
to go up on
the game of thrones shelf 
 all cheering  now  the
only problem is that  uh 
the winds of winter and a dream of
spring have yet to be published 
so those aren t available 
 all sighing 
well  i can t do anything
about what i can t control 
that is total bullshit 
george r r  martin was supposed
to deliver the winds of winter
to his publisher
over two years ago 
warden burns  i know that was
the original deadline 
that s what it says here 
but pm reading to you
from the wikipedia page 
it also says that martin
had a grueling promotion schedule
or something  and it s interfered
with his writing schedule  he s failed
to complete the winds of winter 
that don t make no sense 
those two guys who transferred
in from federal last month
knew about all the new stuff with
the hot chick and her dragons 
warden burns  no 
i m telling you 
i believe those two inmates
had that information
from watching the tv series 
again  i m reading to you 
the series has jumped ahead 
it s no longer
following the books 
leann rimes   singing 
o beautiful
for patriot dream
that sees beyond the years
thine alabaster
cities gleam
undimmed by human tears
america
america
god shed
his grace on thee
and crown thy good
with brotherhood
from sea to
shining
sea
 cheering and applause 
let s blow this thing 
mike  the pace car is in
and we re ready to race 
darrell  mike  it s an honor
to be able to start
this 600 mile race
here on memorial day 
 engines roaring 
boogity  boogity  boogity 
let s go racing for those
who made
the ultimate sacrifice  boys 
joe  d w  s talking about you 
 chuckling 
what  jimmy leave us
some sort of door key
for us to meet up 
something like that 
just remember one thing 
roll  don t hesitate  just roll 
what are you talking about 
what s down there 
remember to roll 
joe  what the fuck 
oh  come on

 joe grunts 
now you didn t tell me
about no garbage chute 
you re right 
jimmy  hey  hey 
it s about time  come on 
joe  yeah  blow me 
jimmy  aw  come on  joe  we
couldn t tell you everything now 
joe  yeah  no  no  no 
screw you both 
a garbage chute 
this is what i get
for doing business
with a couple of unlucky logans 
them s my bleach pens 
two bleach pens and a
plastic bag  as requested 
 exhales 
give me the tube 
hold on  that s it 
we re supposed to believe
that that s the thing 
tube 
now  are you ready 
no  no  hold on  that s it 
that s a plastic bag 
bleach pens 
fake salt and gummy bears 
that s our bomb 
don t call it a bomb 
now  how many yards
away is the vault 
about 20 yards 
i don t know  maybe 30 
is it 20 or is it 30 
we are dealing
with science here 
i guess when i saw
that gummy bears
is our secret
ingredient to our bo   
our explosive device 
that i wasn t
thinking about science 
now  you said yourself
we couldn t bring in
normal explosives
 cause of the security 
now  to make our bang 
we need potassium chlorate 
bleach pens is
pure sodium hypochlorite 
combined with the potassium
chloride in the salt substitute 
we have created
an equal exchange of ions 
sugar  plus potassium chlorate
yields   
two gasses and
a solid 
now  you throw in some heat 
you get energy 
energy means light  explosion 
or  as i like to call it   
the joe bang 
what  you thought
i was going to use
a stick of dynamite
or something 
well  yeah  i kinda did 
yeah  me  too 
i just figured you d use
a lot to blow through
the thick steel walls 
we don t need to
blow through the wall

fish  of course he s with us 
the whole thing was his idea 
sam  yeah 
fish  except he probably

blowed off in iraq was all his fault 
sam  everybody knows
you never would have gone
and joined up to fight if your big
brother wasn t the football star 
well  that s true 
sam  yeah 
he was gonna be hot shit 
he was gonna play for the nfl

you were gonna be just another
white trash coal miner

pulling an attitude here  it s us

moved everything around 
this whole job
changed dramastically 
we had to change the date 
sam  you knew the terms
for our participating 
mmm hmm 
we needed a moral reason
to pull this job with you 
now  we was fine with you wanting
to get back at that store
for messing
with your hot sister 
but you did a whole 360 on everything
when you moved up the date 
and nascar
ain t done nothing to nobody 
nascar is a beautiful thing 
nascar s like america 
it s like you re
making us hurt america 
so moving up that date was a vagrant
fliolation of our morality clause 
i ll show you  vagrant

report er   on tv  authorities have
confirmed they have recovered the money
stolen from
the charlotte motor speedway
in what some are calling
the  hillbilly heist  
sources say an anonymous caller
led police to this gas station
where they discovered an abandoned
truck containing bags of cash
that have been positively linked
to the robbery over the weekend 
police spokesperson  the truck
was reported stolen last week 
our forensic team
is at work on the scene 
and we re certain
that they will find   
why go to all
the trouble to rob a place
if you don t have the guts
to keep the money 
woman 
he must ve chickened out 
newscaster  well  we are joined
now by a resident daredevil 
at little victory
family shelter 
this is josh morrison  thank
you for joining us today 
right  he comes
on about  you know   
he used to come on a lot on
midday  for pet of the week 
so he s joining us to talk
about a new adoption challenge
at the shelter for little victories 
we do have to talk about the   
cal  well  we brought everyone
in at 6 00 this morning 
couldn t work all weekend  you know 
 cause of the race  obviously 
but everything was just like
we left it on friday 
how many men
do you have working today 
well  40 or so 
i guess we re on
a bit of a tight deadline
 cause they re trying to
get everything shored up 
since the season s starting 
we ll be wrapping
out of here this week 
i m gonna need prints
from all your guys 
well  sure  but all the workers
have to wear protective
gloves at all times 
that s   
well  it s a union rule 
union rules 
yep 
great 
agent grayson 
local pd got a call from someone
claiming to be an eyewitness 
swears they saw the robbers 
can definitely identify  em 
yeah  i saw  em 
i know who they are  too 
grayson  why don t we
start at the beginning 
where d you see them 
in a tunnel 
leading from the track back
to the shower
room and the lockers 
man   on tv  there s
a saying in our business 
 set it up and shut up  
so i ll shut up 
max   on tv 
what the hell was that 
you call yourself a driver 
what  you ve never been
boxed in a turn before 
dayton  i told you i didn t
want to drink your poison 
i thought i was having
a heart attack 
max  that poison   
hey  hey 
can t one of you hit mute 
i m trying to give my
statement to the fbi here 
there was two of  em  right 
now one of  em was a bartender
from that place out off
of i 17  got one arm 
the guy with him 
i don t know who he was 
and you know the bartender from 
max  a while back 
i got in a fight at the bar 
with the bartender 
max  no  with his brother 
did the brother
have one arm or two 
the brother s got both 
grayson 
and the fight was about 
i can t remember 
grayson  and you won
that fight at the bar 
hell  yeah  i won it 
so you saw
the bartender with one arm
and an unknown male companion
in the tunnel during the race 
and they were 
well  they was just walking 
but it was suspicious like 
grayson  suspicious how 
they shouldn t have been down there 
that was suspicious 
but you didn t think to mention
this encounter to anyone
until you saw the news on the
television about the robbery 
the docs had to set
my nose  all right 
i ve been in recovery 
so all these
injuries are the result
of your latest
fight with the brothers 
max  bartender brother 
he s the one that
punched me in the tunnel 
the one arm 
yeah  look  just ask
my driver  dayton white 
right  he was with me
when all this went down 
he ll back up my story 
yes  when you called in
your tip  you mentioned
that he d be able
to corroborate your story 
we spoke with
dayton white earlier today 
he stated he was never in the
tunnel with you during the race 
never saw two suspicious men 
and has no idea
what you re talking about 
did you talk to him 
i think you knows better 
mellie  i stopped by the
trailer when he wasn t home 
i think i got
most of your stuff 
you sure love your books 
and there s some
mail there  too 
grayson  visitation logs
indicate that jimmy logan 
an employee
recently fired
from the speedway 
came with his brother clyde
to see joseph bang here 
on april 15th 
they returned two days later
for a second visit 
now  we only have video
of this meeting  no audio 
so we have no idea
what they discussed 
but the following week 
clyde logan drives through the
window of a corner save mart
and ends up being sentenced
to 90 days here 
you seem to have a lot of information
in your fbi folders there 
and so 
you don t think that s
an incredible coincidence 
no  not really 
i mean  if you re asking me  am i shocked
that the criminals locked up in here
are friends with other criminals 
no  i m not 
so clyde logan and joseph bang
were incarcerated here
at your prison on may the 28th 
and you had no problems 
no issues of any kind
at your prison on that day 
is that right 
no  we didn t have any problems 
right   cause monroe
county fire department
said they
dispatched multiple units
around 8 30 p m  that night 
there was a small kitchen fire 
but that s not a problem
in the context of this prison 
i mean  it s
standard operating procedure
for them to
dispatch multiple units
any time there s
a fire at the prison 
that was no big deal  it was
out within a few minutes 
you re certain
that these two inmates
couldn t have
broken out of here 
robbed the speedway and then
broken back into your prison
without you knowing about it 
wow   chuckles 
no 
agent grayson  i ve been warden here for
nine years and i can tell you this 
we don t have
an escape problem at monroe 
reporter   on tv  what do you
think of the robbery 
woman 1  well  i heard that they re
calling it  ocean s 7 eleven  
 cause they found that truck with the
money behind a convenience store 
woman 2  uh   heard that they re
calling  em the redneck robbers 
 cause they think the guys
who did this whole thing
are from around here 
i hope they never catch  em 
reporter  where does
this investigation stand 
man  well 
let me tell you this 
even though the crime was
committed in charlotte 
the fact that
the money was recovered here
makes it a very serious matter 
we re involving all
of our local  state   
you have a problem
with the food here  inmate 
no  no  no  warden 
no problem 
reckon your stomach s
not been bothering you lately 
no  warden  no 
thank   
thank you for asking me 
 tray clatters 
you best be
cleaning up your mess 
guard  now 
sir   clears throat 
huh 
 joe grunts 
what d you say to me  inmate 
go on 
thank you 
grayson  what about the
disgruntled fired employee 
the brother of
the one armed bartender 
jimmy logan was fired
six weeks before the robbery 
his brother  clyde  is
the one armed bartender
max chilblain claims to
have seen during the race 
but we know there s
no way clyde logan
could have been in
that underground walkway
because he was serving time at
the monroe correctional facility
on the day of the robbery 
hmm 
i hate airtight alibis 
where did jimmy
logan s cell phone
tell us he was during the race 
jimmy logan doesn t
have a cell phone 
shut off three months
ago for non payment 
he also drives
a 1983 ford f 150 
so no gps 
no email  no social media 
we did get a few
hits on his name
on other social media accounts 
which place him at valley view
high school during the race 
his daughter was competing in the
miss pretty west virginia pageant 
and apparently she won 
 country song
playing on speakers 
how s your brother 
i wouldn t know 
you haven t talked to him 
nope 
not once 
nope 
 scoffs 
well  it seems
strange  you know 
you two being so close and all 
last i heard  he moved south
to be closer to his daughter 
 exhales 
how far south 
lynchburg 
guess his ex moved down there
when her husband
opened a new car lot 
well 
if you do speak to him   
tell him i d
like to talk to him 
i doubt i ll be talking to him 
he never told you why
he gave all that money back 
on the house 
generous 
you ve had your six months 
and you made no arrests 
meanwhile  the locals
talk about these thieves
like they re some type
of hee haw heroes 
so  we would like
to move forward
and put this entire incident
in our rearview mirror 
if you will 
okay 
thank you again 
i do have one last question 
sure 
you just said you received a
payout from your insurance company
for the money that
wasn t recovered 
yes  that s right 
hmm 
we were here with forensic
accountants for weeks
poring over the register
logs and receipts 
no one here was ever able
to give us an exact accounting
of how much money
was actually stolen 
right  um    it s   
well  it s very complex 
the algorithm and whatnot 
yeah  we heard about
the complicated algorithms 
so how did you arrive
at the number to ask for 
if you didn t know
how much was stolen 
i m not an accountant  so  uh  i
wasn t in there for those discussions 
but as far as all of us here at
charlotte motor speedway are concerned 
the matter has been resolved
to our satisfaction 
 joe clears throat 
 loud knocking on door 
assholes 
 sighs 
 people cheering 
you seriously want to trust
these two with our lives 
they re gonna know
what we want  em to know 
all right 
but we can get two more 
what s rule eight 
 don t get greedy  
all right  you re done here  come on 
you got to get the car anyway  go 
yeah  you re right there  you re right
on top of it  just dig in there 
driver  mr  naaman 
oh  this one s addressed to you 
came in through
the donation box 
it s heavy 
but don t get excited 
it s got to be from a crazy  written
with crayon  know what i mean 
 gasps 
where to  mr  naaman 
 chuckles 
 laughs 
hey 
hi 
new job 
yeah  it s just seasonal 
i hope they keep me on  though 
it s nice being close to home 
you want to come in 
no  no  i ll just wait 
daddy 
hey  what s up  ma  
 grunts  body slam 
what time you want her back 
whatever time
works best for you 
we re just around 
all right 
don t wait up 
all right  so i was
thinking putt putt golf 
they got those new
go karts down there 
sure  as long as
we get gelato after 
gelato 
yeah 
ain t that like fancy ice cream 
i thought you couldn t do that
 cause of your pageants 
sadie  oh  i m over
all that stuff 
i ve been really getting into
the culinary arts lately 
 chuckles 
oh  cum what  
cooking  i ve been
watching a lot of top chef 
really 
yeah 
i ve been learning a lot  like how
gelato isn t just fancy ice cream 
it s made at a slower
churn rate than ice cream 
so less air gets mixed in 
that s why it has
such a silky texture 
jimmy  a churn rate  huh 
yeah  a churn rate  how fast the
paddle in the machine moves 
sometimes the paddle
is called a dasher 
oh  yeah  no 
i know what that is  a dasher 
it s kinda like
dasher and dancer and vixen 
no  daddy 
i know exactly what that is 
no  it s not that 
i didn t know that
reindeer made ice cream 
sadie  they don t 
you funny 
jimmy  you funny 
you funny looking 
 country song
playing on speakers 
you never told me how you
knew the coast was clear
and we could go get the money 
well  you know how
that phone company
that give you about 60 days
to pay that phone bill 
yeah  well  you go one day over
and they shut your phone off 
so 
 jimmy chuckles 
i ain t paid the bill out at the
trailer in like six months 
so 
i figured long as they was tapping
my phone  they d keep it on 
about a week ago 
it finally went dead 
that s pretty good 
yeah 
you came up with
that on your own 
yes  i did 
well  that s a lot of thinking for a logan 
 jimmy chuckles 
hey  jimmy 
 chuckles  hey 
what you doing 
so  mellie   
 clears throat 
 exhales 
what do you make of all
this logan curse stuff 
well  that s clyde s thing  i never
really gave it that much thought 
what about you  you think we re
destined to repeat the past 
no 
i m all about the future 
oh  shoot  sorry about that 
another especial for the lady 
grayson  yeah 
i missed out on the toast 
you know they say it s bad luck
to toast with an empty glass 
they do say that 
it s also bad luck
to toast alone  so 
why don t you pour
yourself one on me 
so you don t jinx me 
clyde  i would have remembered if
you d ever been in the bar before 
are you just passing through 
grayson  yeah  passing through 
but i m hoping to stay a while 
well  then
