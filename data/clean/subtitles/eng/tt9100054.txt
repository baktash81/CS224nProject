yeah
how old are you

oh right between my daughters
i heard youre a professor
i think the correct response
is sounds like fun
what
its a rude joke
will sandwich yeah
uh i teach yeah
yeah comp lit
italian literature really
all right
but im skiving off
right right ahem yeah
comparative literature
mmm yeah
i saw you know a lot of languages
i dont know anything very well
i also wasted a lot of time
do you wanna have dinner with me
yeah i should go shower and change and
no youre fine as you are
i dont have my wallet
uh im inviting you come on
okay
that was so funny
vassili is callies husband
oh i thought he was married
to the older heavyset woman
oh come on
what
shes fat
no but thats callies aunt i think
and lyle who looks after my place
he works for them
oh
mmm
and ninas husband is
toni
toni
yeah
yeah he um comes up the weekends
he has investments in kalamata
sounds dodgy
yeah mmm
and then they all rent
one of these huge villas by the cliffs
its pink
its pink
yeah
they rent the same one every year
wow its like talking about a film i saw
in a language i didnt quite understand
you watch movies
in languages you dont know
yeah
without subtitles
yeah
and you were saying that
um your kids are my age
yeah 25 and 23 bianca and martha
hmm and do they look like you
i dont know its hard to say
if im honest they probably do
oh
because youre beautiful
youre a very smart boy
my mother was very beautiful
and um when i was about marthas age
i felt like she hadnt shared it
like in creating me
shed separated herself
like pushing a plate away
if the foods repulsive
hmm
hmm
but bianca and martha its funny
what i find most interesting
are the secret resemblances
hmm
you know
so what makes bianca seductive
and martha not and vice versa
well they blame me
like when i was younger
i had small breasts
and then as soon as i gave birth
big breasts
and bianca has big breasts
and martha has almost none like a boy
and she doesnt realize
how beautiful she is
and she wears a padded bra
and it sort of humiliates her
and she thinks
ive given the best of myself to bianca
she feels deprived
and um i do understand and like
long time ago
at some point i considered
only half seriously
considered having implants
but um they come from nowhere
so what are they worth
you know
but bianca is completely different
and she would never
let herself feel deprived
she sucks everything out of me
all my secret skills
she pointed out
im finicky about peeling fruit
hmm
i dont like it when the peel breaks
i like when it comes off
in one long whatsit
string
string
yeah very very uptight
yeah
didnt even know that about myself
yeah of course i understand
the problem for me is why did they
schedule them so close together
baby babe
huh

could i order up some wine please
oh no just a just a glass
thank you
actually have you got any champagne
oh right no thats fine uh
how much is a bottle actually
im celebrating
hi
hi leda
this is the paper im giving
im not sure its persuasive
camus posits
that the ontological emptiness
of the universe
chafes against
the intrinsically human desire
for metaphysical meaning
consequently it is jarring
that esslins theatre of the absurd
bourdieu
bourdieus mistake is that he often forgot
the first part of his own name
im sorry walter
walter is sensitive where is he
thats terrible
but what i really want to consider
and i promise
im gonna bring this back to auden
is that which is
not only ineffable
but unthought
ive been really turned on
by ricÅurs recent thinking
on linguistic hospitality and
how about his name ricÅur
gosh i should really
lean into that second syllable
because god he comes from the heart
um
the apple
an object
oh im reading the most astounding piece
on audens the crisis by leda caruso
and it seems to me
that she has anticipated
ricÅurs recent thinking
on linguistic hospitality
for her
hospitality comes
in holding ones attention
even in crisis
as simone weil says
attention is the rarest
and purest form of generosity
suddenly he was
just saying my name and it was
it was crazy
he was no he was talking
about the auden publication
he was saying that um
he was saying that i had anticipated
ricÅurs work on translation and
that yeah that i had anticipated
ricÅurs work on translation
and it was just
i mean it was
wild
and cole looked like
his eyes were going to
he turned around in slow motion
he was absolutely raging
leda caruso is inside
audens private mythology
thank god because whenever
one tries to suppress doubt
there is tyranny
shes got chicken pox
thats crazy she just had a little cold
does she have a fever
oh
thats not really a fever
no
i havent i havent even
i havent even read his recent work
it was all my own thinking
yeah yeah yeah put her on the phone
hi sweetheart
hi is it itchy
aw i know
its not very nice
did daddy give you a dvd
yeah well just dont forget
it gets a little bit scary when the
um can you just hang on
one minute sweetheart
