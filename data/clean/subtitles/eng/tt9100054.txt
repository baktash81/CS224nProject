what are you studying 
  business 
  in greek 
no  no  i m studying in dublin 
and i just work here
for the summers  but  uh 
yeah  i m a bit behind at college 
you know  i wasted a lot of time 
  yeah 
  how old are you 
  twenty four 
  oh  right between my daughters 
i heard you re a professor 
i think the correct response
is   sounds like fun  
  what 
  it s a rude joke 
will sandwich  yeah 
uh  i teach  yeah 
yeah  comp lit 
italian literature  really 
  all right 
  but i m skiving off 
right  right  ahem  yeah 
comparative literature 
mmm  yeah 
  i saw you know a lot of languages 
  i don t know anything very well 
i also wasted a lot of time 
do you wanna have dinner with me 
yeah  i should go shower and change and  
no  you re fine as you are 
  i don t have my wallet 
  uh  i m inviting you  come on 
okay 
that was so funny 
vassili is callie s husband 
oh  i thought he was married
to the older  heavyset woman 
  oh  come on 
  what 
she s fat 
no  but that s callie s aunt  i think 
  and lyle  who looks after my place 
  he works for them 
  oh 
  mmm 
  and nina s husband is 
  toni 
  toni 
  yeah 
yeah  he  um  comes up the weekends 
he has investments in kalamata 
  sounds dodgy 
  yeah  mmm 
and then they all rent
one of these huge villas by the cliffs 
it s pink 
  it s pink 
  yeah 
they rent the same one every year 
wow  it s like talking about a film i saw
in a language i didn t quite understand 
you watch movies
in languages you don t know 
  yeah 
  without subtitles 
yeah 
and you were saying that 
um  your kids are my age 
yeah  25 and 23  bianca and martha 
hmm  and do they look like you 
i don t know  it s hard to say 
if i m honest  they probably do 
oh 
because you re beautiful 
you re a very smart boy 
my mother was very beautiful 
and  um  when i was about martha s age 
i felt like she hadn t shared it 
like  in creating me
she d separated herself 
like pushing a plate away
if the food s repulsive 
  hmm 
  hmm 
but bianca and martha  it s funny 
what i find most interesting
are the secret resemblances 
  hmm 
  you know 
so what makes bianca seductive
and martha not  and vice versa 
well  they blame me 
like  when i was younger 
i had small breasts 
and then as soon as i gave birth 
big breasts 
and bianca has big breasts 
and martha has almost none  like a boy 
and she doesn t realize
how beautiful she is 
and she wears a padded bra
and it sort of humiliates her 
and she thinks
i ve given the best of myself to bianca 
she feels deprived 
and  um  i do understand  and  like 
long time ago 
at some point  i considered 
only half seriously 
considered having implants 
but  um  they come from nowhere 
so what are they worth 
you know 
but bianca is completely different 
and she would never
let herself feel deprived 
she sucks everything out of me 
all my secret skills 
she pointed out
i m finicky about peeling fruit 
hmm 
i don t like it when the peel breaks 
i like when it comes off
in one long whatsit 
  string 
  string 
  yeah  very  very uptight 
  yeah 
didn t even know that about myself 
yeah  of course i understand 
the problem for me is why did they
schedule them so close together 
baby  babe 
huh 
it s sunday  you re on 
it s columbia 
i m working 
i m suffocating 
  please  can you kiss it 
  yeah  sit down 
  mama  please  can you kiss it 
  sit down 
what did you do that for 
i wanted to peel it
like a snake like you do 
please  please  can you kiss it 
it really hurts 
mama 
kiss it 
please 
please 
i can t leave you alone
for one minute

i did soak some black beans 
but didn t get a chance to  do you cook 
  mm hmm 
  i ve left the recipe on the fridge  easy 
just don t want them to go bad 
hi  um 
could i order up some wine  please 
oh  no  just a   just a glass 
thank you 
actually  have you got any champagne 
oh  right  no  that s fine  uh 
how much is a bottle  actually 
i m celebrating 
  hi 
  hi  leda 
this is the paper i m giving 
i m not sure it s persuasive 
camus posits
that the ontological emptiness
of the universe
chafes against
the intrinsically human desire
for metaphysical meaning 
consequently  it is jarring
that esslin s theatre of the absurd 
bourdieu 
bourdieu s mistake is that he often forgot
the first part of his own name 
i m sorry  walter 
walter is sensitive  where is he 
that s terrible 
but what i really want to consider 
and i promise
i m gonna bring this back to auden 
is that which is
not only ineffable
but unthought 
i ve been really turned on
by ricœur s recent thinking
on linguistic hospitality and 
how about his name  ricœur 
gosh  i should really
lean into that second syllable 
because  god  he comes from the heart 
um 
the apple 
an object 
oh  i m reading the most astounding piece
on auden s  the crisis  by leda caruso 
and it seems to me
that she has anticipated
ricœur s recent thinking
on linguistic hospitality 
for her 
hospitality comes
in holding one s attention 
even in crisis 
as simone weil says 
 attention is the rarest
and purest form of generosity  
suddenly he was
just saying my name  and it was 
it was crazy 
he was  no  he was talking
about the auden publication 
he was saying that  um 
he was saying that i had anticipated
ricœur s work on translation and 
that  yeah  that i had anticipated
ricœur s work on translation 
and it was just 
i mean  it was 
 wild 
and cole looked like
his eyes were going to 
he turned around in slow motion 
he was absolutely raging 
leda caruso is inside
auden s private mythology 
thank god  because whenever
one tries to suppress doubt 
there is tyranny 
she s got chicken pox 
that s crazy  she just had a little cold 
does she have a fever 
oh 
that s not really a fever 
no 
i haven t  i haven t even 
i haven t even read his recent work 
it was all my own thinking 
yeah  yeah  yeah  put her on the phone 
hi  sweetheart 
hi  is it itchy 
aw  i know 
it s not very nice 
did daddy give you a dvd 
yeah  well  just don t forget
it gets a little bit scary when the
