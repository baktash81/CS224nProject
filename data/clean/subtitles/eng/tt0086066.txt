natures first green is gold
her hardest hue to hold
her early leafs a flower

then leaf subsides to leaf
so eden sank to grief
so dawn goes down to day
nothing gold can stay

robert frost wrote it
i always remembered it cause
i never quite knew what he meant by it
i never noticed colors clouds and stuff
until you kept reminding me about them
its like they were never there before
i dont think i could ever tell steve
or twobit
or darry about the clouds and sunset

right out of our neighborhood
its useless
fighting aint no good
theyre still writing editorials in the papers
about you being a hero
we are all proud of you
its gonna be all right

so this is what you get for helping people
you punk

bastards
youre not allowed here
im allowed anywhere i want
youre out of your mind
why do you help people
it doesnt do any good
what do you think soda
do you think it makes me look tough
it makes you look different
that guy had sharp teeth
what do you mean by different
you got a hole in your mouth

i asked the nurse to give you this book
so you could finish it
it was worth saving those kids because
their lives are worth more than mine
they have more to live for
tell dally i think its worth it
im gonna miss you guys
ive been thinking about it and that poem
that guy that wrote it
he meant youre gold when youre a kid
like green
when youre a kid everythings new

like the way you dig sunsets thats gold
keep it that way its a good way to be
i want you to ask dally to look at one
i dont think hes ever seen a sunset
theres still lots of good in the world
