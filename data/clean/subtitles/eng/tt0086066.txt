 johnny  are you awake 
 yeah 
there s a monster outside 
what 
we re gonna be okay 
 lying in the pit of the sun 
shoulder to shoulder  head to feet   
    were hundreds of wounded men
lying in the tracks  the sidewalks   
    stretched out in endless rows 
under the car shed 
 some lay stiff and still 
but many withered in the hot sun 
 everywhere swarms of flies
hovered over the men   
    crawling and buzzing in their faces  
that s gross 
 everywhere was blood 
dirty bandages  groans   
    screamed curses of pain  
get him 
come back here 
watch your smoke  johnny 
 y i  one morning i woke up earlier than usual 
 y i  the church was colder than ever  
that was sure pretty 
yeah 
the mist is what s pretty 
all gold and silver 
too bad it can t stay like that all the time 
 y i nothing gold can stay 
 nature s first green is gold 
 her hardest hue to hold 
 her early leaf s a flower 
 but only so an hour 
 then leaf subsides to leaf 
 so eden sank to grief 
 so dawn goes down to day 
 nothing gold can stay  
where did you learn that 
that s what i meant 
robert frost wrote it 
i always remembered it  cause
i never quite knew what he meant by it 
i never noticed colors  clouds and stuff
until you kept reminding me about them 
it s like they were never there before 
i don t think i could ever tell steve
or two bit   
   or darry about the clouds and sunset 
just you and sodapop 
maybe cherry valance 
i guess we re different 
 maybe they are 
 maybe you re right

drop it 
it s not loaded  don t 
stop 
not dally  too 
he s just a kid 
pony 
 i asked the nurse to give you this book 
so you could finish it 
 it was worth saving those kids because
their lives are worth more than mine 
 they have more to live for 
tell dally i think it s worth it 
 i m gonna miss you guys 
 i ve been thinking about it  and that poem 
that guy that wrote it 
 he meant you re gold when you re a kid 
like green 
 when you re a kid everything s new 
dawn 
 like the way you dig sunsets  that s gold 
 keep it that way  it s a good way to be 
 i want you to ask dally to look at one 
i don t think he s ever seen a sunset 
 there s still lots of good in the world
