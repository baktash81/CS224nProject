my grandfather was a lawman 
father too 
me and him was sheriffs at the same
time  him up in plano and me out here 
i think he s pretty proud of that 
i know i was 
some of the old time sheriffs
never even wore a gun 
folks find that hard to believe 
jim scarborough never carried one 
that s the younger jim 
gaston boykins wouldn t wear one
up in comanche county 
i always liked to hear
about the old timers 
never missed a chance to do so 
you can t help but compare yourself
against the old timers 
can t help but wonder
how they d have operated these times 
there s this boy i sent to the electric
chair at huntsville here a while back 
my arrest and my testimony 
he killed a 14 year old girl 
paper said it was a crime of passion 
but he told me there
wasn t any passion to it 
told me he d planned to kill somebody
for as long as he could remember 
said if they turned him out 
he d do it again 
said he knew he was going to hell 
be there in about 15 minutes 
i don t know what to make of that 
i sure do don t 
the crime you see now 
it s hard to even take its measure 
it s not that i m afraid of it 
i always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job 
but i don t want to push
my chips forward and go out
and meet something i don t understand 
a man would have
to put his soul at hazard 
he d have to say   ok 
i ll be part of this world   
yes  sir  i just walked in the door 
he had some sort of thing on him 
like a oxygen tank
for emphysema or something 
and a hose that run down his sleeve 
oxygen tank 
what the hell s he got that for 
you got me  well 
you can look at it when you get in 
  i ll be down there in a bit 
  yes  sir  i got it under control

médico   
   porfavor 
wait up 
   and i had a 44 inch waist 
my diet specialist got a hold of me 
and that first week 
i lost seven pounds 
looking back on the diet  it was
relatively easy to lose the weight 
though it did have moments  sometimes 
it looked as if i gained weight
instead of lost it 
the most difficult part is still ahead 
keeping weight off
now that we ve lost it 
it s natural
for you to gain a few pounds 
but as soon as you do 
make sure you go on   
here are a few points to remember 
first of all  weigh in every day 
any word on those vehicles yet 
sheriff  i found out
everything there was to find 
those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people 
the owner of that bronco s
been dead 20 years 
want me to find out
about the mexican ones 
no  lord  no 
there s this month s checks 
that dea agent called again 
you don t wanna talk to him 
gonna try to keep from it much as i can 
going back  wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him 
that s cordial of him 
can i get you to call loretta 
tell her i m going to odessa
to see carla jean moss 
  yes  sheriff 
  i ll call her when i get there 
i d call now  but if she
want me to come home  i might 
do you want me to wait
till you quit the building 
uh huh  don t wanna lie without
what it s absolutely necessary 
what is it torbert says
about truth and justice 
oh  we dedicate ourselves daily anew 
something like that 
i m gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily 
might come to three before it s over 
what the hell 
sheriff 
you looked at your load lately 
  that is a damn outrage 
  one of those tie downs worked loose 
  how many bodies did you leave with 
  i ain t lost none of  em  sheriff 
couldn t y all have
taken a van out there 
we didn t have no van
with four wheel drive 
you gonna write me up
for improperly secured load 
you get your ass outta here 
buenos días 
i m guessing this isn t the future
you had pictured for yourself
when you first clapped eyes
on that money 
don t worry 
i m not the man who s after you 
i know that 
i ve seen him 
you ve seen him 
and you re not dead 
huh 
what s this guy supposed to be 
the ultimate badass 
don t think that s how i d describe him 
how would you describe him 
i guess i d say
he doesn t have a sense of humor 
  his name s chigurh 
  sugar 
chigurh  anton chigurh 
  you know how he found you 
  yeah  i know how he found me 
  it s called a transponder 
  i know what it s called 
  he won t find me again 
  not that way 
  not any way 
  took me about three hours 
  yeah  well  i been immobile 
  no  you don t understand 
  what do you do 
  i m retired 
  what did you do 
  welder 
  acetylene  mig  tig 
  any of it 
  if it can be welded  i can weld it 
  cast iron 
  yeah 
  i don t mean braze 
  i didn t say braze 
  pot metal 
what did i say 
  were you in  nam 
  yeah  i was  nam 
so was i 
so  what does that make me  your buddy 
look  you gotta give me this money 
i got no other reason to protect you 
it s too late  i spent it 
a million and a half
on whores and whiskey 
and the rest of it 
i just sorta blew it in 
how do you know he s not
on his way to odessa 
  why would he go to odessa 
  kill your wife 
maybe he s the one
that needs to be worried    about me 
he isn t 
yeah  you re not cut out for this 
you re just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles 
i m across the river at the hotel eagle 
carson wells 
call me when you ve had enough 
i can even let you keep
a little of the money 
if i was into cutting deals 
why wouldn t i deal with sugar 
no  no  you don t understand 
you can t make a deal with him 
even if you gave him the money  he d
still kill you for inconveniencing him 
he s a peculiar man 
might even say he has principles 
principles that transcend money or drugs
or anything like that  not like you 
yeah  he s not even like me 
no  he don t talk as much as you 
i give him points for that 
carla jean  thank you for coming 
don t know why i did 
i told you  i don t know where he is 
  you haven t heard from him 
  no  i ain t 
  nothing 
  not word one 
  would you tell me if you had 
  well  i don t know 
  he don t need any trouble from you 
  it ain t me he s in trouble with 
  who s he in trouble with then 
  some pretty bad people 
these people will kill him  carla jean 
they won t quit 
he won t neither  he never has 
he can take all comers 
you know charlie walser s
got that place out east of sanderson 
you know how he used to slaughter
beeves  hit  em right there with a maul 
truss  em and slit their throats 
charlie s got one all trussed up 
all set to drain him
and the beef comes to 
thrashing around 
six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock 
you ll excuse the    well   
charlie grabs a gun 
shoot the thing in the head 
but with the swinging and thrashing 
it s a glance shot 
ricochets  hits charlie in the shoulder 
you go see charlie  he still can t
pick up his right hand for his hat 
the point being  that even in
the contest between man and steer 
the issue is not certain 
when llewelyn calls 
just tell him i can make him safe 
 course  they slaughter
steers a lot different these days 
use a air gun  shoots out a little rod
about that far under the brain 
sucks right back in 
animal never knows what hit him 
  why are you telling me that  sheriff 
  i don t know 
my mind wanders 
hello  carson 
let s go to your room 
you don t have to do this 
i m a day trader

i think i lost it 
second one  it was like we

and i was a horseback 
going through the mountains of a night 
going through this pass
in the mountains 
it was cold 
and there was snow on the ground 
and he rode past me and kept on going 
never said nothing going by 
just rode on past 
he had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down 
when he rode past 
i seen he was carrying fire in a horn 
the way people used to do  and i   
i could see the horn
from the light inside of it 
 bout the color of the moon 
and  in the dream  i knew that he was   
   going on ahead
