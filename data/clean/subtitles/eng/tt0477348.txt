my grandfather was a lawman
father too
me and him was sheriffs at the same
time him up in plano and me out here
i think hes pretty proud of that
i know i was
some of the oldtime sheriffs
never even wore a gun
folks find that hard to believe
jim scarborough never carried one
thats the younger jim
gaston boykins wouldnt wear one
up in comanche county
i always liked to hear
about the oldtimers
never missed a chance to do so
you cant help but compare yourself
against the oldtimers
cant help but wonder
how theyd have operated these times
theres this boy i sent to the electric
chair at huntsville here a while back
my arrest and my testimony
he killed a 14yearold girl
paper said it was a crime of passion
but he told me there
wasnt any passion to it
told me hed planned to kill somebody
for as long as he could remember
said if they turned him out
hed do it again
said he knew he was going to hell
be there in about 15 minutes
i dont know what to make of that
i sure do dont
the crime you see now
its hard to even take its measure
its not that im afraid of it
i always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job
but i dont want to push
my chips forward and go out
and meet something i dont understand
a man would have
to put his soul at hazard
hed have to say ok
ill be part of this world

ah
médico
porfavor
wait up
and i had a 44 inch waist
my diet specialist got a hold of me
and that first week
i lost seven pounds
looking back on the diet it was
relatively easy to lose the weight
though it did have moments sometimes
it looked as if i gained weight
instead of lost it
the most difficult part is still ahead
keeping weight off
now that weve lost it
its natural
for you to gain a few pounds
but as soon as you do
make sure you go on
here are a few points to remember
first of all weigh in every day
any word on those vehicles yet
sheriff i found out
everything there was to find
those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people
the owner of that broncos
been dead 20 years
want me to find out
about the mexican ones
no lord no
theres this months checks
that dea agent called again
you dont wanna talk to him
gonna try to keep from it much as i can
going back wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him
thats cordial of him
can i get you to call loretta
tell her im going to odessa
to see carla jean moss
yes sheriff
ill call her when i get there
id call now but if she
want me to come home i might
do you want me to wait
till you quit the building
uhhuh dont wanna lie without
what its absolutely necessary
what is it torbert says
about truth and justice
oh we dedicate ourselves daily anew
something like that
im gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily
might come to three before its over
what the hell
sheriff
you looked at your load lately
that is a damn outrage
one of those tiedowns worked loose
how many bodies did you leave with
i aint lost none of em sheriff
couldnt yall have
taken a van out there
we didnt have no van
with fourwheel drive
you gonna write me up
for improperly secured load
you get your ass outta here
buenos días
im guessing this isnt the future
you had pictured for yourself
when you first clapped eyes
on that money
dont worry
im not the man whos after you
i know that
ive seen him
youve seen him
and youre not dead
huh
whats this guy supposed to be
the ultimate badass
dont think thats how id describe him
how would you describe him
i guess id say
he doesnt have a sense of humor
his names chigurh
sugar
chigurh anton chigurh
you know how he found you
yeah i know how he found me
its called a transponder
i know what its called
he wont find me again
not that way
not any way
took me about three hours
yeah well i been immobile
no you dont understand
what do you do
im retired
what did you do
welder
acetylene mig tig
any of it
if it can be welded i can weld it
cast iron
yeah
i dont mean braze
i didnt say braze
pot metal
what did i say
were you in nam
yeah i was nam
so was i
so what does that make me your buddy
look you gotta give me this money
i got no other reason to protect you
its too late i spent it
a million and a half
on whores and whiskey
and the rest of it
i just sorta blew it in
how do you know hes not
on his way to odessa
why would he go to odessa
kill your wife
maybe hes the one
that needs to be worried about me
he isnt
yeah youre not cut out for this
youre just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles
im across the river at the hotel eagle
carson wells
call me when youve had enough
i can even let you keep
a little of the money
if i was into cutting deals
why wouldnt i deal with sugar
no no you dont understand
you cant make a deal with him
even if you gave him the money hed
still kill you for inconveniencing him
hes a peculiar man
might even say he has principles
principles that transcend money or drugs
or anything like that not like you
yeah hes not even like me
no he dont talk as much as you
i give him points for that
carla jean thank you for coming
dont know why i did
i told you i dont know where he is
you havent heard from him
no i aint
nothing
not word one
would you tell me if you had
well i dont know
he dont need any trouble from you
it aint me hes in trouble with
whos he in trouble with then
some pretty bad people
these people will kill him carla jean
they wont quit
he wont neither he never has
he can take all comers
you know charlie walsers
got that place out east of sanderson
you know how he used to slaughter
beeves hit em right there with a maul
truss em and slit their throats
charlies got one all trussed up
all set to drain him
and the beef comes to
thrashing around
six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock
youll excuse the well
charlie grabs a gun
shoot the thing in the head
but with the swinging and thrashing
its a glance shot
ricochets hits charlie in the shoulder
you go see charlie he still cant
pick up his right hand for his hat
the point being that even in
the contest between man and steer
the issue is not certain
when llewelyn calls
just tell him i can make him safe
course they slaughter
steers a lot different these days
use a air gun shoots out a little rod
about that far under the brain
sucks right back in
animal never knows what hit him
why are you telling me that sheriff
i dont know
my mind wanders
hello carson
lets go to your room
you dont have to do this
im a day trader
i could just go home
you could
make it worth your while
take you to an atm
theres 14 grand in it
and everybody just walks away
an atm
i know where the satchel is
if you knew you would have it with you
i can find it from the river bank

and placed at my feet
you dont know to a certainty
in 20 minutes it could be here

never said nothing going by
just rode on past
he had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down
when he rode past
i seen he was carrying fire in a horn
the way people used to do and i
i could see the horn
from the light inside of it
bout the color of the moon
and in the dream i knew that he was
going on ahead
