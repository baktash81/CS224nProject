mr devr eaux
the average apartment at
the tower costs 56 million
its the most expensive real
estate in north america
we have the best views
the most advanced security system
keyless entry
24hour video vibration detection
but you know what these
people are really buying
white neighbors
us the staff
they pay for our full and undivided
attention seven days a week
so theres no
cell phones iphones
blackberries
texting tweeting
they had a rule at the bk
no sex in the storage room
same as your
phone rule right
no not the same
because your dick
has to come with you
to work mr devr eaux
but your phone
can stay at home
so dont hide it in your pocket
or tuck it into your sock
dont tape it under your
balls or stick it up your ass
because eventually

me at merrill lynch
mr fitzhugh you know this
apartment is now owned by the bank
theyd like you to
vacate immediately
we told the kids that we
were turning the apartment
into a park
going green
thats how we explained
all the furniture
being sold and the tents in the living room
luckily my children arent very bright
so they bought it
but they have smart friends and
those friends are catching on
sir the bank will be
here tomorrow morning
i went to yale 20 years ago
and now im a squatter
cant wait for their reunion
hello nice to see you i squat

so you see
i have to stay here
because we have
nowhere else to go
its illegal for you to be here
youre committing a crime
i understand that
but we might be doing some
elevator maintenance tomorrow
im thinking that the elevators will be shut down
and those people from the bank will
just have to come back another time
because
its like you go down one

thats arthur shaw
he lives in the tower
he was bringing his laundry down
they kidnapped him
this was not a kidnapping
it was an attempt to flee
what
arrest him and get him out of here
josh do me a favor
turn off the heater and cover the pool
i hate to waste money
wall street kingpin
arthur shaw
number 138 on
the forbes 400 last year
was arrested today in manhattan
while trying to flee the city
sources have confirmed
that hell be charged
with several counts
of securities fraud
and an immediate asset freeze of mr
shaws holdings has been ordered
shaws lawyers
have called the arrest
another example of the wall street witchhunt
but sources at the sec
believe the fraud
in this case could be
of epic proportions
in this country youre
innocent until proven guilty
so no matter what you hear about mr
shaw being a liar and a cheat
or his entire business being
some sort of elaborate scam
we simply dont
know the truth yet
ive got shoes
to polish mr k
what does this
got to do with us
for the last six years mr
shaw was on the board of the tower
so we have to find
a new board member
no
several years ago at
one of the meetings
he was asked to
do a favor for us
he was asked to manage
all of your pensions
pensions
and he did
he took us on even though
it was a small account
he agreed to handle it
who asked him
to do that
i did rose
i asked him
mr k whats left
in the pension
kwan all this just happened
so theres no way of knowing
and by the way
this could be a mistake
how much josh
tell us
right now theyre
saying that anyone who
invested with mr shaw
has been defrauded
and that more than likely
its all gone
there is no pension
wait wait
wait a minute im sorry
how did this happen
the guy is the best
in new york
and he promised he could triple our portfolio
so theyre going
to get our money
the guy had billions
of dollars right
of course
its just a matter of time
so we have to stay patient and be positive
because it has to be there
i heard on the news
when they arrested shaw
that he only had 600
in his checking account
look some of you may need
some time to process this
if anyone wants
to go home
i will call in a temp crew
for the rest of the day
im sure that this will all be cleared up tomorrow
can i ask you
something mr k
yeah
did he get your money too
yeah odessa
for the record
i never asked anyone
to triple my portfolio
just an hour ago
a federal judge released arthur
shaw on 10 million bail
on condition he remain under house
arrest at his penthouse apartment
on central park west
mr shaw i need
a statement from you
you need to back off
can i get a comment

you need to back off
excuse me
here over here come on shaw
right here shaw
shaw can we get a picture

were taking shaw and his
attorney up to the penthouse
i need mr shaws
personal security code
that was my street address on steinway
boulevard in astoria when i was a kid
my client would like
access to the gym on 43
even serial killers get 15
minutes of exercise a day
he has my permission
to jump out the window
the rules of mr shaws
house arrest are simple
kovaks no visitors without
prior permission from the fbi
all incoming and outgoing
mail gets vetted by my office
all food deliveries
packages
cleaning repairs
all that has to be cleared by the agent on duty
you tell your staff
that this penthouse is now
a maximum security prison
and it will be guarded as such
the fbi is in control of
the elevator and this floor
what the hell is this
agent denham
that is a 1963 ferrari 250 gt lusso
owned and raced by the coolest
cat who ever lived steve mcqueen
this was his baby
and now its my baby
you got steve mcqueens car
parked in your living room
and here i thought
you were an asshole
i paid a million
for it 10 years ago
i wouldnt sell it
for 10 times that
were 65 stories up
how do we get it out of here
you dont
this car was taken
apart piece by piece
and reassembled
inside this room
this car will eventually
be sold at auction
with the rest of
your belongings
only if im guilty
agent denham which im not
if you leave this apartment for
any reason without my say so
and youll be remanded into federal custody
and forfeit
10 million bail
you have yourself
a nice day mr shaw
kovaks will you
come with me
josh do me
a favor will you
yes sir mr shaw
make sure you handle
all my food deliveries
youre smart enough
to know im innocent
i dont want the help
to spit in my coffee
they wouldnt do that sir
yeah but you
get it right
do it as a favor to me
sorry we dont accept tips at the tower
right im sorry
sometimes i forget the rules
why did you let him
get away with that
when he made that crack about
the help spitting in his coffee
you wanted to hurt him
hell i wanted to hurt him
sometimes residents say things
they dont mean it doesnt faze me
either that or
you got no balls
what
im out of line
im sorry
i have balls
all right
im sure you got
big balls whatever
i dont have to
defend my balls to you
im just saying the guy stole from
everyone who works in your building
and it looked like you
gave him a free pass
maybe next time ill
rip out his larynx
but today i chose to do my job
as manager of this building
okay my mistake kovaks
just that most guys from your block in astoria
cant control
themselves
and most girls from forest
hills dont end up in the fbi
thats where
youre from right
here
this is where most whitecollar
crimes are solved the garbage
when do you think you will
be getting the money back
im not really allowed to
discuss the case with you
but youre allowed
to clothesline me
i was apprehending
a fugitive
hes only a fugitive
if hes guilty right
oh
arent you
the loyal friend
i never said
we were friends
you play chess together
youre the one who asked
him to invest the pension
i get his mail
i open his car door
i buy his cheese
were not friends
let me ask you something
kovaks
if hes innocent
wheres the money

supposed to tell my staff
is that too much to ask

lester tried to step in front
of a subway train tonight
an offduty
traffic cop was there
and pulled him back
at the last second
they have him on
a 48hour hold
where is he
if you wanted a sick day
all you had to do was ask

im going to tell the doctor
somebody pushed you
it was a misunderstanding
okay
i gave it to him josh
all my money
i asked him to
invest it for me
shaw

thats 29 years
of opening doors
73000 and change
and i gave him every penny
in a few months i wont have money for rent

all those years of opening doors
year after year
truth is people can
open their own doors

hey charlie
hey josh
hey
so theyre evicting me this morning
my wife already took the kids
wants a divorce
so if you need me
ill be living in this box
can i ask you a question
youre a wall street guy
when did shaw realize
that it was over for him
ten months
maybe a year
i heard he was interviewing
lawyers over the summer
so if he took someones
money a few months ago
probably needed the cash
to keep up appearances
throw his famous labor day party at the beach
at a certain point
it isnt about securities fraud
its about catering
drop mr fitzhugh on 59
im going to the penthouse
wow this is
going to be good

lester stepped in front of a subway train
oh jesus

josh you need to listen to me
the fbi is lying to you
josh put down the club
christs sake

investing money is a gamble
it doesnt always pay off
mr shaw do you care
josh come on
no really
do you feel any responsibility
for what happened to lester
of course i feel badly
i had no idea he was going to lose everything
lester has been a part of
my life for over a decade
then why havent you asked
me whether hes alive or dead
josh this car

barred from ever entering again

one wall standing
dead center in the middle of the apartment

whats with the police
josh arthur shaw
is gonna walk
what
the judge is gonna dismiss the
case next week at his hearing
theyre acting
like hes untouchable
thats it he just
gets away with it
thats not it
hes threatening to press charges against you
he wants you to
answer for the ferrari
so theyre here
to arrest me
he says hell drop the whole
thing if you apologize
a sincere apology
thats what shaw wants
and if i dont do it
then these gentlemen
will read you your rights
you know whats considered the greatest
move in the history of chess josh
a man named
frank james marshall
was losing to a man
named levitsky in 1912
world championship
in helsinki
and it looked like marshall had no
chance until he moved 23 queen g3
he deliberately
sacrificed his queen
and the move was so shocking and surprising
that levitsky
never got over it
he lost the game
two moves later
and the move became known in the
annals of chess as the marshall swindle
im a very good chess player
but im no swindler
what you did to my ferrari
was the move of a small man
but now its my move
and im not sure how i want to play this
all id like
to say mr shaw
is someday im gonna find
a way to make things right
i dont care
what i have to do
i will find
a way to pay you back
for everything
that has been done
good because i know how
difficult it must be for you
to lose a service job
like this at your age
and one day when all this is ancient history
i hope you can come back
maybe not as a building
manager at first
but somewhere where you can start over
earn our trust
a doorman
for instance
now go home and practice your chess game
ill study the marshall swindle sir
anybody can sacrifice
their queen josh
