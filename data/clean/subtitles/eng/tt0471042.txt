and i m ready for
the big leagues 
bk  what is that 
a building downtown 
no  it s a burger king
in times square 
all right  walk with me 
mr  dev r eaux 
the average apartment at
the tower costs  5 6 million 
it s the most expensive real
estate in north america 
we have the best views 
the most advanced security system 
keyless entry 
24 hour video vibration detection 
but you know what these
people are really buying 
white neighbors 
us  the staff 
they pay for our full and undivided
attention seven days a week 
so there s no
cell phones  iphones 
blackberries 
texting  tweeting   
they had a rule at the bk 
no sex in the storage room 
same as your
phone rule  right 
no  not the same 
because your dick
has to come with you
to work  mr  dev r eaux 
but your phone
can stay at home 
so don t hide it in your pocket
or tuck it into your sock 
don t tape it under your
balls or stick it up your ass 
because  eventually 
i will find it 
they never checked
my balls at the bk

this is your
responsibility  josh 
the bank comes in the morning

yeah 
hey  did you see what
the market did today 
went up 106 points

why 
i don t know 
but i used to know 
that s why they hired
me at merrill lynch 
mr  fitzhugh  you know this
apartment is now owned by the bank 
they d like you to
vacate immediately 
we told the kids that we
were turning the apartment
into a park 
going green 
that s how we explained
all the furniture
being sold and the tents in the living room 
luckily  my children aren t very bright 
so they bought it 
but they have smart friends and
those friends are catching on 
sir  the bank will be
here tomorrow morning

 hello  nice to see you  i squat  
what about family 
no  i invested all their money 
they won t return my calls 
i d sleep in my car 
but they repossessed it three months ago 
so  you see 
i have to stay here 
because we have
nowhere else to go 
it s illegal for you to be here 
you re committing a crime 
i understand that 
but we might be doing some
elevator maintenance tomorrow 
i m thinking that the elevators will be shut down
and those people from the bank will
just have to come back another time 
because 
it s like you go down one 
hey  mr  kovaks 
mr  shaw  i see you met mr 
dev r eaux

lester  it s 9 15  why is mr 
shaw s car still here 
maybe he s sick 
that black sedan has been
parked there for two days 
why no boot or ticket 
i called
the cops twice 
do you remember
that morning robbery
at the international
last year 
i want you to slowly lock the
door and clear the lobby 
stay calm 
lock it down 
code black on all doors and elevators 
repeat  code black 
what s code black 
are you serious 
we talked about it at the meeting last month 
let me see the outside
of the building 
i think we re
about to be robbed 
there were four guys
out there with guns 
where did they go 
let me see the garage 
why is stillman here 
laundry pick up was yesterday 
mr  shaw asked us
to call him 
someone spilled wine
on his tablecloth 
he s bringing it
down right now 
wait a second 
those are not the stillman brothers 
oh  my god 
they re taking shaw 
this isn t a robbery 
it s a kidnapping 
it s a kidnapping 
call 911 
yes  sir

get your hands
in the air 
fbi  show me your hands 
  let s go 
  okay  all right 
put them behind your back 
take it easy 
no  get off him 
he s the victim 
that s arthur shaw 
he lives in the tower 
he was bringing his laundry down 
they kidnapped him 
this was not a kidnapping 
it was an attempt to flee 
what 
arrest him and get him out of here 
josh  do me a favor 
turn off the heater and cover the pool 
i hate to waste money 
wall street kingpin
arthur shaw 
number 138 on
the forbes 400 last year 
was arrested today in manhattan
while trying to flee the city 
sources have confirmed
that he ll be charged
with several counts
of securities fraud
and an immediate asset freeze of mr 
shaw s holdings has been ordered 
shaw s lawyers
have called the arrest
 another example of the wall street witch hunt  
but sources at the sec
believe the fraud
in this case could be
of epic proportions 
in this country you re
innocent until proven guilty 
so no matter what you hear about mr 
shaw being a liar and a cheat 
or his entire business being
some sort of elaborate scam 
we simply don t
know the truth yet 
i ve got shoes
to polish  mr  k 
what does this
got to do with us 
for the last six years  mr 
shaw was on the board of the tower 
so we have to find
a new board member 
no 
several years ago at
one of the meetings 
he was asked to
do a favor for us 
he was asked to manage
all of your pensions 
pensions 
and he did 
he took us on even though
it was a small account 
he agreed to handle it 
who asked him
to do that 
i did  rose 
i asked him 
mr  k  what s left
in the pension 
kwan  all this just happened 
so there s no way of knowing 
and by the way 
this could be a mistake 
how much  josh 
tell us 
right now  they re
saying that anyone who
invested with mr  shaw
has been defrauded 
and that more than likely 
it s all gone 
there is no pension 
wait  wait 
wait a minute  i m sorry 
how did this happen 
the guy is the best
in new york
and he promised he could triple our portfolio 
so they re going
to get our money 
the guy had billions
of dollars  right 
of course 
it s just a matter of time 
so we have to stay patient and be positive 
because it has to be there 
i heard on the news
when they arrested shaw
that he only had  600
in his checking account 
look  some of you may need
some time to process this 
if anyone wants
to go home 
i will call in a temp crew
for the rest of the day 
i m sure that this will all be cleared up tomorrow 
can i ask you
something  mr  k 
yeah 
did he get your money  too 
yeah  odessa 
for the record 
i never asked anyone
to triple my portfolio 
just an hour ago 
a federal judge released arthur
shaw on  10 million bail 
on condition he remain under house
arrest at his penthouse apartment
on central park west 
mr  shaw  i need
a statement from you 
you need to back off 
can i get a comment
please  mr  shaw 
you need to back off 
excuse me 
here  over here  come on  shaw 
right here  shaw 
shaw  can we get a picture 
over here  mr  shaw 
we re taking shaw and his
attorney up to the penthouse 
i need mr  shaw s
personal security code 
24719 
that was my street address on steinway
boulevard in astoria when i was a kid 
my client would like
access to the gym on 43 
even serial killers get 15
minutes of exercise a day 
he has my permission
to jump out the window 
the rules of mr  shaw s
house arrest are simple 
kovaks  no visitors without
prior permission from the fbi 
all incoming and outgoing
mail gets vetted by my office 
all food deliveries 
packages 
cleaning  repairs 
all that has to be cleared by the agent on duty 
you tell your staff
that this penthouse is now
a maximum security prison
and it will be guarded as such 
the fbi is in control of
the elevator and this floor 
what the hell is this 
agent denham 
that is a 1963 ferrari 250 gt lusso 
owned and raced by the coolest
cat who ever lived  steve mcqueen 
this was his baby 
and now it s my baby 
you got steve mcqueen s car
parked in your living room 
and here i thought
you were an asshole 
i paid a million
for it 10 years ago 
i wouldn t sell it
for 10 times that 
we re 65 stories up 
how do we get it out of here 
you don t 
this car was taken
apart piece by piece
and reassembled
inside this room 
this car will eventually
be sold at auction
with the rest of
your belongings 
only if i m guilty 
agent denham  which i m not 
if you leave this apartment for
any reason without my say so 
and you ll be remanded into federal custody
and forfeit
 10 million bail 
you have yourself
a nice day  mr  shaw 
kovaks  will you
come with me 
josh  do me
a favor  will you 
yes  sir  mr  shaw 
make sure you handle
all my food deliveries 
you re smart enough
to know i m innocent 
i don t want the help
to spit in my coffee 
they wouldn t do that  sir 
yeah  but you
get it  right 
do it as a favor to me 
sorry  we don t accept tips at the tower 
right  i m sorry 
sometimes i forget the rules 
why did you let him
get away with that 
when he made that crack about
the help spitting in his coffee 
you wanted to hurt him 
hell  i wanted to hurt him 
sometimes residents say things
they don t mean  it doesn t faze me 
either that or
you got no balls 
what 
i m out of line 
i m sorry 
i have balls 
all right 
i m sure you got
big balls  whatever 
i don t have to
defend my balls to you 
i m just saying the guy stole from
everyone who works in your building
and it looked like you
gave him a free pass 
maybe next time i ll
rip out his larynx 
but today i chose to do my job
as manager of this building 
okay  my mistake  kovaks 
just that most guys from your block in astoria
can t control
themselves 
and most girls from forest
hills don t end up in the fbi 
that s where
you re from  right 
here 
this is where most white collar
crimes are solved  the garbage 
when do you think you will
be getting the money back 
i m not really allowed to
discuss the case with you 
but you re allowed
to clothesline me 
i was apprehending
a fugitive 
he s only a fugitive
if he s guilty  right 
oh 
aren t you
the loyal friend 
i never said
we were friends 
you play chess together 
you re the one who asked
him to invest the pension 
i get his mail 
i open his car door 
i buy his cheese 
we re not friends 
let me ask you something 
kovaks 
if he s innocent 
where s the money 
how should i know 
the same way you knew
i was from forest hills 
you pay attention 
i just want to know what i m
supposed to tell my staff 
is that too much to ask 
tell them he s guilty 
get on the car 
hey  hey  hey 
come on 
put your hands behind your back 
come on  man 
what s this about 
this is bullshit  shit 
that s police brutality  yo 
come on now 
man in the suit

her teeth fixed 
come on now

ladies and gentlemen 
the next brooklyn bound
local train is now arriving

from the platform edge 
especially when trains are
entering and leaving the station 
hello 
dr  carr  dial 118  please

lester tried to step in front
of a subway train tonight 
an off duty
traffic cop was there
and pulled him back
at the last second 
they have him on
a 48 hour hold 
where is he 
if you wanted a sick day 
all you had to do was ask 
seriously  i need you back at work 
i m going to tell the doctor
somebody pushed you 
it was a misunderstanding 
okay 
i gave it to him  josh 
all my money 
i asked him to
invest it for me 
shaw 
yeah 
a couple of months ago 
i gave him everything i had  my life savings 
six years
working the back door
at the waldorf 
nine at the carlyle 
three at the pierre 
11 with you at the tower 
that s 29 years
of opening doors 
 73 000 and change 
and i gave him every penny 
in a few months i won t have money for rent 
i can t retire now 
all those years of opening doors 
year after year 
truth is  people can
open their own doors 
not the way you do it 
lester  he s going to pay you back every penny 
i promise 
josh  please calm down 
hold the elevator 
you can t go up there 
you re acting like a vigilante

hey  charlie 
hey  josh

so  they re evicting me this morning 
my wife already took the kids

so  if you need me 
i ll be living in this box 
can i ask you a question 
you re a wall street guy 
when did shaw realize
that it was over for him 
ten months 
maybe a year 
i heard he was interviewing
lawyers over the summer 
so if he took someone s
money a few months ago 
probably needed the cash
to keep up appearances 
throw his famous labor day party at the beach 
at a certain point 
it isn t about securities fraud 
it s about catering 
drop mr  fitzhugh on 59 
i m going to the penthouse 
wow  this is
going to be good 
don t get up  whoa 
where do you think you re going 
we re just going
to get the trash 
and the breakfast order 
go ahead

good morning  josh  charlie  enrique 
how are you doing 
how was your labor day party this year 
mr  shaw

a shit about my tone 
what are you 
some kind of tone master 
josh  come on 
i m going to ask you one time  okay

here we go 
what are you doing 
josh  you need to listen to me 
the fbi is lying to you 
josh  put down the club 
christ s sake

investing money is a gamble 
it doesn t always pay off 
mr  shaw  do you care 
josh  come on 
no  really 
do you feel any responsibility
for what happened to lester 
of course i feel badly 
i had no idea he was going to lose everything 
lester has been a part of
my life for over a decade

destruction of property
and civil rights charges
right down our throats 
now  i don t care
what shaw did
or how much money
he s accused of stealing 
and you know damn well i got
murdered by that son of a bitch

and a gang of vigilantes
will not be tolerated
at the tower

thanks for getting me fired 
hey 
hey  thank you
for coming down 
yeah  no problem 
you got something for me

because it violates
everything i believe in 
mmm hmm 
we still haven t
found shaw s safety net 
all these guys  they keep some cash
close by in case they have to run 
shaw clears out all of his
accounts three months ago 
20 million and change 
but when we bust him 
the money isn t on him 
wait 
 20 million 
there s a chance we ll
get lucky and find it 
and if we get lucky 
maybe you can get lucky 
i m not lucky 
you just have
to be patient 
i don t really have
time to be patient 
well  if you re
tired of waiting around 
you can always try
the old school approach 
what s that 
grab some pitchforks and a couple
of guys and storm the castle 
they d never
see you coming 
i have to pee 
ooh  i m gonna   
i have to go 
whoa  whoa 
you can t drive 
i m gonna get a crab 
crab

three federal laws
when you beat up
shaw s ferrari

bureau want to buy you a drink 
and so do i 
bye 
goodbye 
manuel

sasha told me
you took a job 
oh  yeah  i m using all the skills
you taught me as a concierge 
thank you very much 
hey  no spitting  blue shirt 
suck it 
douche bag 
it s not a bad job 
only problem is
i need 40 hours to
get on the insurance 
it s hard to get shifts 
but if i don t get on the insurance 
it s probably gonna end up costing us
around  20 000
to have the baby 
so we ll probably
have to sell it 
i need your help 
so you re saying you wanna rob
 20 million from arthur shaw 
which you think he s
hidden in a secret wall safe
inside his
penthouse apartment 
an apartment which he s not allowed to leave
and is guarded by three fbi agents 
24 hours a day 
two 
and you wanna do all of this in a building
with the most
advanced security
and surveillance
system in the world 
a building which we ve all been
barred from ever entering again 
yes  how do you
guys feel about that 
well  i ve really
enjoyed myself 
thanks for the crackers 
mr 
fitzhugh  i know the money is in that safe 
how do you know 
because in 2003 
shaw remodeled 
he spent like 10 million to blow out the kitchen 
move the living room 
he even brought in
some guy from china
to do a whole
feng shui thing 
but he left
one wall standing 
dead center in the middle of the apartment 
that s where
he put the safe 
maybe it s
a load bearing wall 
no  no  it isn t 
we have the same
wall in my place 
we took it down
when we first moved in 
the fbi can t find the money 
because he hid it in the wall 
i know it 
so you guys

hey  agent denham  what a surprise 
what s with the police 
josh  arthur shaw
is gonna walk 
what 
the judge is gonna dismiss the
case next week at his hearing 
they re acting
like he s untouchable 
that s it  he just
gets away with it 
that s not it 
he s threatening to press charges against you 
he wants you to
answer for the ferrari 
so they re here
to arrest me 
he says he ll drop the whole
thing if you apologize 
a sincere apology 
that s what shaw wants 
and if i don t do it 
then these gentlemen
will read you your rights 
you know what s considered the greatest
move in the history of chess  josh 
a man named
frank james marshall
was losing to a man
named levitsky in 1912 
world championship
in helsinki 
and it looked like marshall had no
chance until he moved 23 queen g 3 
he deliberately
sacrificed his queen
and the move was so shocking and surprising
that levitsky
never got over it 
he lost the game
two moves later 
and the move became known in the
annals of chess as the  marshall swindle  
i m a very good chess player 
but i m no swindler 
what you did to my ferrari
was the move of a small man 
but now it s my move 
and i m not sure how i want to play this 
all i d like
to say  mr  shaw 
is someday i m gonna find
a way to make things right 
i don t care
what i have to do 
i will find
a way to pay you back
for everything
that has been done 
good  because i know how
difficult it must be for you
to lose a service job
like this at your age 
and one day when all this is ancient history 
i hope you can come back 
maybe not as a building
manager at first 
but somewhere where you can start over 
earn our trust 
a doorman 
for instance 
now go home and practice your chess game 
i ll study the  marshall swindle   sir 
anybody can sacrifice
their queen  josh
