of communication
safety security comfort
all in the gentle caress
of a finger
or the brush of lips
on a soft cheek
it connects us
when were happy
bolsters us in times of fear
excites us
in times of passion
and love
we need that touch
from the one we love
almost as much
as we need air to breathe
but i never understood
the importance of touch
his touch
until i couldnt have it

the tan lines
might be incredible

cover half your boob

procuring your room
for your guests
you rent by the hour or what
so that was you
lurking in the hall
mmm i dont lurk
and you followed me here
i wanted to introduce myself
but that little attitude
of yours
let me guess
youre the kind of guy
that ignores the rules
cause it makes you feel
in control am i right
youre not wrong
you think thats cute
do you think its cute
letting your friends
borrow your room for sex
is disgusting so no
you dont like sex
no i like
sex i like sex
sex is fine
fine isnt exactly
a ringing endorsement
but ill take some common
ground where i can get it
we have nothing in common
ooh thats cold
what
what are you doing up here
six feet at all times
you both know the rules
will get back to your room
there you go
a little name for
your psychological profile
im will newman
and you are
deaf
stella thank you
for putting your mask back on
stella
you need to lighten up
its just life
itll be over
before you know it
so hes a cfer
b cepacia
part of a new drug trial
for cevaflomalin
you contract that
and you can
you can kiss the possibility
of new lungs goodbye
theres no coming back
from that bacteria
stay away
hello world
okay afflovest
for 30 more minutes
then youre all set
you need anything else
before i hit the road
chocolate pudding for two
oh so what
im room service now
gotta take
advantage of the perks
all right
good girl good girl
all right good
right
right sweetie
ill see you tomorrow
bye barb
okay
like
all kids with cystic fibrosis
i was born terminal
which doesnt necessarily mean
im gonna die tomorrow
but i could die tomorrow
anyone could die tomorrow
i just have
a little bit less time
than everyone else
my lungs are at about
50 function right now
so at this rate
dr hamid says
that ill need a transplant
by the time
im a junior in high school
thatll be fun
hi guys shh
were at the nicu
because im obsessed
with babies
and barb
the beautiful barb
is giving me permission
to come in here by myself now
cystic fibrosis as you know
is a genetic disease
that basically makes my body
produce a shit ton of mucus
fun fact i have to be
extremely careful
around other people with cf
the rule is that were not
supposed to get
within six feet
because we could end up
catching
each others bacteria
a lot of people
dont realize that new lungs
generally only last
about five years
which is okay actually
because most of us
are just trying to stay alive
long enough
for a new treatment
to come out
just chilling here
in my new afflovest
which is really cool
because now i dont have to be
hooked up to the wall
which obviously im not
because im hanging
upside down on my bed
this is actually good
for getting the mucus up
and stuff
i know cute right
dang girl
you look worn
who is he
is it anyone i know
whatd you get
what
are those truffles
howd you get truffles
oh you gotta
bring them with sister
wow
look at how spicy
that food cart is
im impressed
all right
lets talk about me
im single
you broke up with michael
maybe he broke up with me
did he
it was mutual
no it wasnt
why you actually
really liked him
and i thought
he was gonna be the one
he obviously isnt
screw him anyway right
at least you got to do that
poe
poe
poe you okay
choking 310
im sorry julie
my leg hit the call button
you scared us poe
yeah try chewing next time
here stella
enjoy your truffles asshole
and please be careful
i love you stella

some kind of
savetheworld hero complex

out of it
these meds are not optional
yeah thats probably why
they keep shoving them
down my throat
youre making me crazy
hey
stella come on
six feet
i need you
to follow your regimen
strictly and completely
please
why dont
why dont you tell me
whats going on actually

any jokes or laugh

and i know that youre
not doing your treatments
and its really
really messing me up
okay i wanna help you

i dont even know how to do
what youre asking me to
thats bullshit
thats bullshit
all cfers know
how to administer
their own treatments

yes
all right
ill help you
but if i do
whats in it for me

stella nothing is going to
save our lives
were breathing borrowed air
enjoy it

youre gonna do
is get a med cart

im poe
b cepacia
damn thats rough
yeah
so no lung transplant for me
when did you contract it
about eight months ago now
it colonized so quickly
i was on the transplant list
one minute and then
im sure that attitude
is whats giving stella fits
yeah whats up with that
she told me that she has
control issues or something
call it what you want
shes got her shit together
she definitely keeps me
in line
so uh
have you two
no
no no no
ive known that girl
since i was like seven
i dont know man
sounds like you love her
of course i love her
so why havent you done
anything about it
because
shes not a he
dont worry
i dont like white boys
dr hamid said
that you suddenly
wanna be responsible
for your own regimen
dont make me regret this
did you wipe everything down
yes this wasnt
my idea you know
are we still clear
yes hurry up
im almost done
okay your med carts
all set up
i built an app
for chronic illnesses
itll alert you when to do
your treatments
and take your pills
built an app
like you built it
surprise
its pretty simple
you should be able
to figure it out
okay stella
dont tell me that
the one time youre interested
in some guy hes a cfer
i just helped him set up
his med cart
that thats it
thats all
i know you stella
organizing a med cart
is like foreplay
theyre called manners

im halfnaked
youre supposed to be doing
your afflovest right now
and did you take your creon
are those the suppositories
okay

you and tim you and rick
you and michael
dont go there
they knew you were sick

you were the one who ran

who should i put that on
michael or my family
its my sickness
its my problem
maybe we can get will
to marry you
hes loaded
hes not picky
he likes you
i am sorry
about you and will
stella
what
stella
hello
there is something
a little bit different
i want to talk about today
burkholderia cepacia
the risks the restrictions
and the rules of engagement
b cepacia
is a hardy bacteria
okay it is so adaptive
that it literally feeds
on penicillin
so our first line
of defense is
cal stat a hospitalgrade
hand sterilizer
apply liberally and often
next is
good oldfashioned latex
triedandtrue
used for protection
in all types of activities
b cepacia thrives best
in saliva or phlegm
fun fact
a cough can travel six feet
a sneeze can travel
up to 200 miles per hour
but the no saliva thing
also means no kissing
ever
so our best defense
is distance
six feet at all times
tada
heres a pool cue
it measures
approximately five feet
five feet
ive given a lot of thought
to foot number six
and you know what
it made me mad
when you have cystic fibrosis
so much is taken from you
you live
every day of your life
according to treatments
and pills and schedules
most of us
cant have children
a lot of us
dont even live long enough
to try to have children
shit its complicated
to try to explain
but its even hard
to fall in love
so after all that
cf has stolen from me
from us
i dont mind stealing
a little something back
one foot
one fucking foot
of space of distance
of length or whatever
you wanna call it
i dont mind
stealing that back
because cf
youre not the thief anymore
im the thief now
five feet apart
deal
are you in
im so in
atrium 900
why didnt i pack
anything nice
oh cause you always pack
for a hot hospital romance
is this seethrough
dont even think about it ho
hi
hi
he cut and ran
when i was born
i guess having a sick kid
wasnt part of his plan
what about your mom
shes beautiful and driven
and smart
shes just focused on me
and me alone
so starting tomorrow
when im 18
i will be making the decisions
for myself
wait wait wait wait
tomorrows your birthday
you could have told me that
i dont have
a present for you
how about you just promise to
stick around for the next one
come on
im getting out of here
there is this one theory
i like
that says to understand death
you have to look at birth
so like
while were in the womb
were living that existence
not knowing
that our next existence
is just an inch away
so maybe its the same
with death
maybe death is just
the next life
but an inch away
or maybe its just
a big sleep baby
lights out
done and done
no
theres no way
that abby just blinked out
i refuse to believe it
what happened with abby
she was cliff diving
in california
she landed wrong
broke her neck and drowned
they said
she didnt feel any pain
but how would they know
if she felt pain
i was supposed to be there
with her but i got sick
like i always do
i just keep imagining it
over and over again
what she was feeling
without knowing that
she just never stops dying
stella
even if you were there
you still wouldnt know
but i wasnt there
she died alone
isnt that how
were gonna die
drowning
just without the water
our own fluids
doing the dirty work
i think about
that last breath a lot
gasping for air
not getting any
no air
just black
but thats only on mondays
otherwise
i dont dwell on it
theres that smile
god youre beautiful
and brave
i wish i could touch you
i lied
when we met
ive never had sex
ive never wanted anyone
to see me
the scars uh
the tube
nothing about its sexy
everything about you is sexy
i think youre perfect
good morning
see those lights out there
abby and i would
call them stars
and we would make wishes
shed never tell me
what her wish was
but i knew she wished
for new lungs for me
i hope she gets her wish
yeah me too

i just dont know
if i can walk away
if youre still looking at me
please
i love you
so much
he left this for you
human touch
our first form
of communication
safety security comfort
all in the gentle caress
of a finger
or at the brush of lips
on a soft cheek
hey stella
you cant record that no
it connects us
when were happy
abby no
bolsters us
in times of fear
can you turn that off
excites us
in times of passion
ah no stella no
stop
and love
we need that touch
from the one we love
almost as much
as we need air to breathe
but i never understood
the importance of touch
his touch
until i couldnt have it
so if youre watching this
and youre able
