of communication 
safety  security  comfort 
all in the gentle caress
of a finger 
or the brush of lips
on a soft cheek 
it connects us
when we re happy 
bolsters us in times of fear 
excites us
in times of passion
and love 
we need that touch
from the one we love
almost as much
as we need air to breathe 
but i never understood
the importance of touch 
his touch 
until i couldn t have it 
oh 
oh  yeah 
oh  yeah  this one s perfect 
actually  though 
the tan lines
might be incredible 
oh  my gosh  that doesn t even
cover half your boob 
this is actually cute 
that s actually really cute

you rent by the hour or what 
so  that was you
lurking in the hall 
mmm  i don t lurk 
and you followed me here 
i wanted to introduce myself 
but that little attitude
of yours   
let me guess 
you re the kind of guy
that ignores the rules
 cause it makes you feel
in control  am i right 
you re not wrong 
you think that s cute 
do you think it s cute 
letting your friends
borrow your room for sex
is disgusting  so  no 
you don t like sex 
no  i like
sex  i like sex 
sex is fine 
fine isn t exactly
a ringing endorsement 
but i ll take some common
ground where i can get it 
we have nothing in common 
ooh  that s cold 
what   
what are you doing up here 
six feet at all times 
you both know the rules 
will  get back to your room 
there you go 
a little name for
your psychological profile 
i m will newman 
and you are 
deaf 
stella  thank you
for putting your mask back on 
stella 
you need to lighten up 
it s just life 
it ll be over
before you know it 
so  he s a cfer 
b  cepacia 
part of a new drug trial
for cevaflomalin 
you contract that
and you can   
you can kiss the possibility
of new lungs goodbye 
there s no coming back
from that bacteria 
stay away 
hello  world 
okay  afflovest
for 30 more minutes 
then you re all set 
you need anything else
before i hit the road 
chocolate pudding for two 
oh  so  what 
i m room service now 
gotta take
advantage of the perks 
all right 
good girl  good girl 
all right  good 
right 
right  sweetie 
i ll see you tomorrow 
bye  barb 
okay 
like
all kids with cystic fibrosis 
i was born terminal 
which doesn t necessarily mean
i m gonna die tomorrow 
but i could die tomorrow 
anyone could die tomorrow 
i just have
a little bit less time
than everyone else 
my lungs are at about
50  function right now 
so at this rate 
dr  hamid says
that i ll need a transplant
by the time
i m a junior in high school 
that ll be fun 
hi  guys  shh 
we re at the nicu
because i m obsessed
with babies 
and barb   
the beautiful barb
is giving me permission
to come in here by myself now 
cystic fibrosis  as you know 
is a genetic disease
that basically makes my body
produce a shit ton of mucus 
fun fact  i have to be
extremely careful
around other people with cf 
the rule is that we re not
supposed to get
within six feet
because we could end up
catching
each other s bacteria 
a lot of people
don t realize that new lungs
generally only last
about five years 
which is okay actually
because most of us
are just trying to stay alive
long enough
for a new treatment
to come out 
just chilling here
in my new afflovest 
which is really cool
because now i don t have to be
hooked up to the wall 
which obviously i m not
because i m hanging
upside down on my bed 
this is actually good
for getting the mucus up
and stuff 
i know  cute  right 
dang  girl 
you look worn 
who is he 
is it anyone i know 
what d you get 
what 
are those truffles 
how d you get truffles 
oh  you gotta
bring them with  sister 
wow 
look at how spicy
that food cart is 
i m impressed 
all right 
let s talk about me 
i m single 
you broke up with michael 
maybe he broke up with me 
did he 
it was mutual 
no  it wasn t 
why  you actually
really liked him 
and i thought
he was gonna be the one 
he obviously isn t 
screw him anyway  right 
at least you got to do that 
poe 
poe 
poe  you okay 
choking  310 
i m sorry  julie 
my leg hit the call button 
you scared us  poe 
yeah  try chewing next time 
here  stella 
enjoy your truffles  asshole 
and please be careful 
i love you  stella 
phase one clinical trials

uh    not that it s
any of your business   
is this    what 
why would   
is this what an aneurysm
looks like 
why  ugh 
look  i get that you have
some kind of
save the world hero complex
going on 
but can you leave me
out of it 
these meds are not optional 
yeah  that s probably why
they keep shoving them
down my throat 
you re making me crazy 
hey 
stella  come on 
six feet 
i need you
to follow your regimen
strictly and completely 
please 
why don t   
why don t you tell me
what s going on  actually

any jokes or laugh 
i have control issues 
and i need to know
that things are in order 
and i know that you re
not doing your treatments
and it s really 
really messing me up 
okay  i wanna help you 
i do 
i don t even know how to do
what you re asking me to 
that s bullshit 
that s bullshit 
all cfers know
how to administer
their own treatments 
we re practically doctors
by the time we re 12 
are you serious 
am i actually messing you up 
yes 
all right 
i ll help you 
but if i do 
what s in it for me 
no  not like   
i    i wanna draw you 
no 
why not  i m serious 
no 
okay 
then no deal 
you really can t practice just
a little bit of discipline
even to save your own life 
stella  nothing is going to
save our lives 
we re breathing borrowed air 
enjoy it 
fine 
but i m not posing
for hours on end 
and your regimen 
we re doing it my way 
okay  the first thing
you re gonna do
is get a med cart
in your room  deal 
deal 
shake on it 
funny 
shit 
oh  god  no  no  no 
hey 
you missed the show 
yeah 
you doing stunts in there 
well  there s no better place
to break a leg 
that s fair 
i m will 
i m poe 
b  cepacia 
damn  that s rough 
yeah 
so  no lung transplant for me 
when did you contract it 
about eight months ago now 
it colonized so quickly 
i was on the transplant list
one minute and then   
i m sure that attitude
is what s giving stella fits 
yeah  what s up with that 
she told me that she has
control issues or something 
call it what you want 
she s got her shit together 
she definitely keeps me
in line 
so  uh 
have you two   
no 
no  no  no 
i ve known that girl
since i was  like  seven 
i don t know  man 
sounds like you love her 
of course  i love her 
so  why haven t you done
anything about it 
because
she s not a he 
don t worry 
i don t like white boys 
dr  hamid said
that you suddenly
wanna be responsible
for your own regimen 
don t make me regret this 
did you wipe everything down 
yes  this wasn t
my idea  you know 
are we still clear 
yes  hurry up 
i m almost done 
okay  your med cart s
all set up 
i built an app
for chronic illnesses 
it ll alert you when to do
your treatments 
and take your pills   
built an app 
like you built it 
surprise 
it s pretty simple 
you should be able
to figure it out 
okay  stella 
don t tell me that
the one time you re interested
in some guy  he s a cfer 
i just helped him set up
his med cart 
that    that s it 
that s all 
i know you  stella 
organizing a med cart
is like foreplay 
they re called manners 
are you doing your afflovest 
yeah

i can t 
i m half naked 
you re supposed to be doing
your afflovest right now 
and did you take your creon

trevor von

trevor von and amy presley

that s afraid to take risks 
what about you and your life
and your relationships 
you and tim  you and rick 
you and michael 
don t go there 
they knew you were sick
and they loved you 
you were the one who ran 
every time  you ran 
you don t know
what you re talking about 
you ruined every chance
you ve ever had at love 
so just keep your advice
to yourself 
bitch 
asshole 
you know  you re right 
i am afraid 
you know what someone gets
for loving me 
they get to pay
for all my care 
and then
they get to watch me die 
deductibles  meds 
hospital stays  surgeries 
when i turn 18 
there s no more full coverage 
who should i put that on 
michael or my family 
it s my sickness 
it s my problem 
maybe we can get will
to marry you 
he s loaded 
he s not picky 
he likes you 
i am sorry
about you and will 
stella 
what 
stella 
hello 
there is something
a little bit different
i want to talk about today 
burkholderia cepacia 
the risks  the restrictions
and the rules of engagement 
b  cepacia
is a hardy bacteria 
okay  it is so adaptive
that it literally feeds
on penicillin 
so  our first line
of defense is
cal stat  a hospital grade
hand sterilizer 
apply liberally and often 
next is
good old fashioned latex 
tried and true 
used for protection
in all types of activities 
b  cepacia thrives best
in saliva or phlegm 
fun fact 
a cough can travel six feet 
a sneeze can travel
up to 200 miles per hour 
but the  no saliva  thing
also means no kissing 
ever 
so  our best defense
is distance 
six feet at all times 
ta da 
here s a pool cue 
it measures
approximately five feet 
five feet 
i ve given a lot of thought
to foot number six 
and you know what 
it made me mad 
when you have cystic fibrosis 
so much is taken from you 
you live
every day of your life
according to treatments 
and pills  and schedules 
most of us
can t have children 
a lot of us
don t even live long enough
to try to have children 
shit  it s complicated
to try to explain 
but it s even hard
to fall in love 
so  after all that
cf has stolen from me 
from us 
i don t mind stealing
a little something back 
one foot 
one fucking foot
of space  of distance 
of length  or whatever
you wanna call it 
i don t mind
stealing that back 
because cf   
you re not the thief anymore 
i m the thief now 
five feet apart 
deal 
are you in 
i m so in 
atrium  9 00 
why didn t i pack
anything nice 
oh   cause you always pack
for a hot hospital romance 
is this see through 
don t even think about it  ho 
hi 
hi 
he cut and ran
when i was born 
i guess having a sick kid
wasn t part of his plan 
what about your mom 
she s beautiful and driven
and smart 
she s just focused on me
and me alone 
so  starting tomorrow 
when i m 18 
i will be making the decisions
for myself 
wait  wait  wait  wait 
tomorrow s your birthday 
you could have told me that 
i don t have
a present for you 
how about you just promise to
stick around for the next one 
come on 
i m getting out of here 
there is this one theory
i like
that says   to understand death 
you have to look at birth  
so  like 
while we re in the womb 
we re living that existence
not knowing
that our next existence
is just an inch away 
so  maybe it s the same
with death 
maybe death is just
the next life 
but an inch away 
or maybe it s just
a big sleep  baby 
lights out 
done and done 
no 
there s no way
that abby just blinked out 
i refuse to believe it 
what happened with abby 
she was cliff diving
in california 
she landed wrong 
broke her neck and drowned 
they said
she didn t feel any pain 
but how would they know
if she felt pain 
i was supposed to be there
with her  but i got sick 
like i always do 
i just keep imagining it
over and over again 
what she was feeling 
without knowing that 
she just never stops dying 
stella 
even if you were there 
you still wouldn t know 
but i wasn t there 
she died alone 
isn t that how
we re gonna die 
drowning 
just without the water 
our own fluids
doing the dirty work 
i think about
that last breath a lot 
gasping for air 
not getting any 
no air 
just black 
but that s only on mondays 
otherwise 
i don t dwell on it 
there s that smile 
god  you re beautiful 
and brave 
i wish i could touch you 
i lied
when we met 
i ve never had sex 
i ve never wanted anyone
to see me 
the scars  uh 
the tube 
nothing about it s sexy 
everything about you is sexy 
i think you re perfect 
good morning 
see those lights out there 
abby and i would
call them stars
and we would make wishes 
she d never tell me
what her wish was 
but i knew she wished
for new lungs for me 
i hope she gets her wish 
yeah  me too

what that book of yours says 
that the soul knows no time 
my drug trial s not working 
i want you to know
that this past month
will last forever for me 
my only regret is that
you didn t get to see
your lights 
i finally got you speechless 
you know  people are always
saying if you love something 
you have to learn
to let it go 
i thought
that was such bullshit 
till i watched you almost die 
in that moment  stella 
nothing mattered to me 
except you 
i m sorry 
i don t wanna go

i can t 
i need you to be safe

could you close your eyes 
i just don t know
if i can walk away
if you re still looking at me 
please 
i love you
so much 
he left this for you 
human touch 
our first form
of communication 
safety  security  comfort 
all in the gentle caress
of a finger 
or at the brush of lips
on a soft cheek 
hey  stella 
you can t record that  no 
it connects us
when we re happy   
abby  no 
   bolsters us
in times of fear   
can you turn that off 
   excites us
in times of passion   
ah  no  stella  no 
stop 
   and love 
we need that touch
from the one we love
almost as much
as we need air to breathe 
but i never understood
the importance of touch 
his touch 
until i couldn t have it 
so  if you re watching this
and you re able
