  bobby 
  boss 
i ll have a pint
and a pickled egg 
coming straight up 
if you wish to be
the king of the jungle 
it s not enough
to act like a king 
you must be the king 
and there can be no doubt 
because doubt causes chaos
and one s own demise 
hello  my love 
it s date night tonight 
nine o clock 
you and i  river cafe 
who s there 
ros  who s there 
chink  chink 
fletcher 
buenas tardes  raymondo 
i should stab you with
that fucking rolling pin 
oh  don t be cunty  i was just hoping we
could have a cozy little drink together 
so  i ve got a meeting on saturday
at your favorite newspaper 
as the best private investigator
in this smoky little town   
good evening 
ladies and gentlemen   
they are ready to put 150 grand in
my pocket to give them some filth 
good for me  that 
but in this case   
it s bad for you 
so big dave 
editor extraordinaire 
has developed a terrible
antipathy for your boss
and his liquorish assortment
of tasty mates 
he s out to destroy him and all those
that cozy up to him  front cover  bosh 
there will be blood and fucking
feathers everywhere  my darling 
get to it  fletcher 
i m starting to itch 
now  we both know that your boss has
very  very deep pockets 
and i would like to invite him just
to have a teeny rummage in them 
what the fuck
are you talking about 
if you would be so kind
as to furnish me with
20 million british pounds 
i will give you everything   
memory cards  contact sheets 
recordings  the lot 
and a modest little screenplay
i wrote all by myself 
hold on 
we just went from  150 000
to 20 million 
that s a steep rise
in 30 seconds 
yeah  but i would argue that you re
lucky  because that is nothing
compared to what i could 
and perhaps should  be asking 
oh  well  thank god
you re not greedy  fletcher 
you deluded 
shit eating cunt 
i quite like it
when you talk dirty to me 
i can feel myself engorging 
come on  have a drink with me 
it s really yummy 
i looked it up  app ed it 
1500 quid 
i didn t know you could spend
that much on a bottle of scotch 
i m gonna tell you a story to
demonstrate why my quote is my quote 
will you play a game
with me  ray 
i don t wanna play a game 
  please 
  no 
i said play a fucking game
with me  ray 
right 
lovely 
now  i want you
to imagine a character 
a dramatic character 
like in a book or a play or a film 
but not digital 
not on a memory stick 
analog  chemical process 
 keep the grain in the picture   i say 
old school  35 mill 
now  i m seeing this
through a lens  i am 
and i m not talking about
the small screen 
it s not tv  raymond 
as i said 
old school cinema format 
it s what we in the business called
anamorphic  or ratio 2 35 to 1 
and i want you to join me
on this cinematic journey 
 cause it is cinema  ray 
it s beautiful 
beautiful cinema 
now  roll camera 
enter our protagonist 
he s good looking 
he s gorgeous 
he s golden age 
he s a proper handsome cunt 
his name is mickey pearson 
unique background
has our mickey 
american born  rhodes scholar 
so he s born clever but poor 
now  that s quite a leap from
a trailer park in americana
to the thousand year old
university in old angleterre 
where he studies
the dark art of horticulture 
but he never finished his education 
never went home  because   
he found his vocation 
a naughty vocation 
he s a bad boy 
he starts dealing
the dirty wonder weed
to his rich  british 
upper class uni pals
and realizes
he s rather good at it 
he s clear and objective
about ambition
and he can surf the echelons
of our complicated culture 
he knew how to take advantage
of his advantage 
he was a hungry animal 
you see 
he was powerful and ruthless 
cunning and quick 
charismatic and smart  but   
he had to do some naughty
things to get where he got 
to establish his position 
to show he wasn t just
teeth  tits and tan 
well  he wasn t
fucking hollow  was he 
he had an engine
under his hood
and a gun in his holster 
so  he s not exactly clean 
our mickey 
he has come up the hard way 
he s earned his position 
shall we say 
well  that was the early days 
and he cracked on with
his new world pioneer spirit 
what s he worth today 
100  200  500 million 
but now the plot
begins to thicken 
he has reached
a crossroads in his life 
the middle class and the middle
age  they ve got to him 
they ve corrupted his appetite
for the horrors  he s gone soft 
he wanted to cash in his chips
and get out of the game 
and he seems to have found
the perfect customer 
smash cut  please   
to interior  a gala dinner 
just a few words to say
thank you to michael pearson
for his limitless generosity
and time 
now  mickey has been cultivating
a special relationship
with the erudite  learned and
broad minded matthew berger 
yes  raymond  i do know about
the jewish billionaire cowboy 
another slice of americana
creating drama in angleterre 
and finally to matthew berger
blindsiding us with his donation
to build the entire cognitive
behavioral therapy unit 
so these two have met before 
fuck knows where 
presumably at the annual international
drug dealers convention in las vegas 
and they ve done
some small deals together 
but now they re ready
for the big one 
well  that was unexpected 
matthew 
now i understand why you re
seated at the head of the table 
snuck that one right by me  didn t
you  you naughty little girl 
making a splash
with the gentry 
oh  i like to make a splash
whenever possible 
well  you also seem to understand
the significance of a proper attire 
indeed i do 
i believe
a sense of ownership
is vital
in every aspect of life 
perhaps never more so than
when it comes to wardrobe 
for every look there is a season 
and for every season a strategy 
now starts the alpha dance 
they re not really talking
about clothes  raymond 
oh  fucking no 
they re like
a pair of old doggies
sniffing round one another s
intellectual assholes 
it s a good old fashioned
cock off  raymond 
michael  i m looking forward
to doing business together 
  may we excuse ourselves 
  yes  please 
we should say good night
to our host 
so what do you think 
i m not sure 
your grace 
he s a fox 
and foxes
have a predictable nature 
trust this jew
about that jew 
if you let him
in the henhouse 
you can expect blood
and feathers everywhere 
fresh from
a farmyard pheasant shoot 
these two are starting
to like each other 
it s looking good  ray 
it s looking fucking good 
i m impressed with what you ve done with your enterprise 
you see  try as i might 
i can t work out how you do it 
and bush is my game 
how does anyone grow
50 tons of super skunk
without letting anyone else
know how they do it 
i m flattered to hear that
from you  matthew 
i imagine that big brain of yours
is sweating a stream of tears
just trying
to figure it out 
brilliance
should be acknowledged 
mm 
run the numbers
by me again 
200 million gross p a  
100 million net 
but your people
know this already 
they ve swept the numbers
for months now 
the bottom line is i ll sell
it to you for 400 million 
but you knew that already 
hop in 
now  i can t be specific
about the heroes and zeros 
but there was a lot of money
hanging in the balance 
question  what would it be
worth to have the power
to be able to pull the plug
on an operation like that 
answer  a greedy man would
want half the sale price 
but a smart man would know
that 20 million pounds
was just about uncomfortable enough
to make everyone feel comfortable 
you re a cunning and creative
toad  aren t you  fletcher 
coming up
with a plan like this 
yeah  but i didn t really
come up with it  did i 
it was big dave 
he commissioned me
to do a job on mickey 
you know  sniff about 
keep an eye on him 
go through his bins 
reveal his sins 
mickey pearson  the odious yankee gangster 
we re gonna bury him 
because it seems he s got himself
a new friend  lord pressfield 
question 
is that the lord pressfield 
his grace  the duke 
yeah  once fourth in line
to the throne 
apparently mickey pearson
has squeaked his way
into the crack
of his fat  posh ass 
this is yours  fletcher  i need a man
with your creativity  with your nose 
now  you know
you re my favorite bloodhound 
i just think it s really
important to remember
who you re talking to  dave 
of course i remember 
fletcher 
so just make absolutely sure the
check doesn t disappoint this time 
the number is 150 000 
he wants to ruin him 
but i am here
to do you a favor 
and it s not like you re not
getting something for your money 
you could even turn that script
into a feature film  raymond 
we could make it together 
we could be partners 
i have learned off you lot 
you gotta look after number
one  and now it s my turn 
the sun is not going up
for me  ray  it s going down 
so why has big dave
got it in for my boss 
two months ago 
your man mickey
made my man dave feel
like a right fucking idiot 
henry  mickey 
how did he do that 
didn t accept his hand 
  dave  daily print 
  yes 
no  editor
of the daily print 
turns out dave had
gone after one of mickey s lords 
did a proper tabloid job
on him 
it would appear that his
lordship had had a quick spin
on one of
his attractive young footmen 
after the splash  shares
crashed  job went  wife followed 
and even his kids
disowned him 
well  that dave
can t half be a cunt 
but no one
will pull him on it 
too fucking scared that dave
will do a feature on them 
but your mickey  he s got
a fabulous set of balls 
so he snubbed him in front of a crowd
that dave could only wish he belonged to 
you know  lords and ladies  the sort that
mickey feels very comfortable in front of 
men  excuse us 
well  he might just as
well have pulled dave s cock off 
i do believe that was a bit
of a fuck off  dave 
 cause he just
fizzled like a party balloon 
that s no reason
to go after a fella 
well  i don t know what to tell you 
he wants mickey s blood 
and he would be getting it
too  if it wasn t for   
you re a filthy fantasist 
and now it s time to leave 
oh  don t be silly 
i m only just lubing you up 
now  there is a reason why matthew 
or anyone else for that matter 
cannot work out
how mickey does what he does 
how does he grow 50 tons of white
widow super cheese every year 
everyone knows
that needs a lot of space 
so where is the space and how
come he s kept it under wraps 
you can t just dig a hole in the ground
and drop 200 shipping containers in there 
oh  no  my love 
that will not work 
no  you have to be creative 
you need an angle 
the problem with land in this
country is there s not much of it   
and there s public access even
when it s supposed to be private 
and the public have rights 
dog walkers   
yes  jog on 
   footpaths  right to roam 
bimblers  ramblers 
badger lovers   
   and any other busy cunt
with enough time on his hands
to sniff
the green tweed of england 
good morning 
and they have groups 
forums  meetings 
social media 
and they love
a good chat and a hiss
about anyone who s decided to
mow his lawn without a license 
and then there s the helicopters 
drones  google earth 
heritage sites 
parish councils 
and the beat goes on 
and that s before you even think
about getting power in here 
so what is
mickey s unique method 
i tip my cap at the cheek 
at the elegance  at the class 
and what would
that method be exactly 
you have to understand
a culture to understand a man 
toffs  aristocrats 
dukes  duchesses 
lords and ladies 
lots of land
and fuck all dough 
houses to keep  damp to
keep out  silver to polish 
you must remember
that cash is very persuasive
to the class that got spanked by
angry lefties and death duties 
and every time you inherit a
fortune  you lose half to the state 
so this is my moment to swoop in
like a guardian fucking angel
and offer my services so they
can keep their houses in order 
and they re not too bothered
about what i do 
as long as that cash
keeps rolling in each year 
it s good to get a lord  yes 
but it s not easy 
it takes work 
wine  women and disco 
twelve sites  twelve farms 
one thousand of these estates
in the great uk 
bonne chance
trying to find them all 
that s it  my infrastructure 
and that  sir  is  with my
blessing  what you are paying for 
if it s as discreet and as
lucrative as you claim it is 
i ll buy the whole business 
but enough foreplay  michael 
i wanna see your plant 
i ve gone to great lengths
to make my operation
as invisible as possible 
matthew 
if you were standing on my
bush  you wouldn t know it 
as a matter of fact 
you are standing on my bush 
it s a spectacular business 
michael 
such a shame it will go
bankrupt in ten years
when things go legal
in the great uk 
and you want me
to pay top dollar for it 
a nugget under half a yard 
that is the price 
now step inside and i ll show
you what half a yard gets you 
ooh  a delightful tool shed
for 400 million dollars 
is the ball peen hammer
included 
course it is 
now let me show you the nails 
watch your head 
carry on  chaps 
england s
green and pleasant land 
those are some nails 
location  staff  technology 
see  you re buying the substructure
for the superstructure to come 
and with purchase you will
inherit the best sites available 
the finest botanists and herb
sommeliers in the world 
as well as the most innovative
marijuana technology on the planet 
and when this little piggy
goes to legal market
and the demand
way outpaces the supply   
these locations 
these green fingered botanical boys 
as well as
my superior technology 
will be at a premium 
and you would own them all 
did you know it took 15 years after
alcohol prohibition ended back home
for the legal market
to scratch that itch 
fifteen years 
and that s if
you do nothing with it 
yes  it s a win win 
no matter how you look at it 
and i m not greedy 
you and i both know
that 400 million is a
fair to generous asking price 
especially considering
that once this game s kosher 
it s going to be worth
somewhere between 200 billion
and  well 
half a trillion pounds 
annually 
weed 
bush 
skunk amola 
white widow super cheese 
it s the new gold rush 
this is the thin end
of a very fat wedge  sir 
if it s such a fat wedge 
why don t you keep it 
you see  i ve developed a reputation
as a man who came up the hard way 
you could say that there s blood
on these pretty white hands 
but in the new business 
once legal and under the jurisdiction
of the respectable umbrella
of ministerial legitimacy 
an enterprise like this will
need a face with a clean past 
which sadly i do not possess 
retirement
doesn t sound so bad 
long walks in the countryside 
pruning roses with my better half 
raising some cubs 
i ve earned it 
look  we both know growing
is only 50  of the business 
i need
your european connections 
i ve seen
how the sausage is made 
now tell me
about the butcher shops 
well  that comes later 
matthew 
when the money s in escrow 
now that we ve established
the dilemma of our protagonist 
let us turn to our antagonist 
many miles away 
across the open plains 
another beautiful feral beast
lopes his way to a watering hole 
who are you talking about
now 
i talk  raymondo  of dry eye 
oh  dry eye 
what is he 
chinese  japanese  pekingese 
get on your fucking knees 
dirty dragon filth 
  yellow is the color
gambling is the game  
he explodes on the scene like a millennial
fucking firecracker  bang  bang  bang 
you chee bye motherfuckers 
i m gonna have to
stop you right there  fletcher 
that doesn t sound like
the dry eye i know 
just making sure you re
paying attention  raymond 
so let s cut instead
to a somewhat anticlimactic
but suave and debonair
dry eye 
like a chinese james bond 
 ricense  to kill 
  open them up 
  yes  boss 
good lord 
hose them down  load them up
and fuck them off 
  let me have a look at 432 
  yes  boss  it s just right here 
there s 120 rims  uh 
32 ls engines  60 custom   
all right  pay the man 
sorry  chaps  i quoted you for
a 20 when it s a 40 footer 
it s gonna be double bubble 
double bubble 
a gentleman s quote
is a gentleman s word 
now  either you or your family are
gonna have to pay for that lesson 
do we have an understanding 
yes  boss 
give the soppy prick
his money 
anyway 
let s put a pin in dry eye
and turn again to mickey 
if you re thinking
of smoking that in here   
don t 
i find that confusing 
do you mean don t smoke
or don t think 
oh   
oh  all right  all right 
it s going out 
i think the time has come
for me to introduce you to our queen 
harold  bag 
a cockney cleopatra
to mickey s cowboy caesar 
the only weak link in his
otherwise impregnable armor
is his devotion  his passion 
some would say his obsession
with his beauteous lady wife 
i m trying to do you
a favor here  mike 
but every time i do you a favor 
it ends up costing me too 
  now  come on  ros   
  why is miss kova still here 
that range was supposed
to be finished this morning 
  i m not talking to you  mike 
  sorry  boss  rodge is on the range 
how many times have i told you 
i don t want roger up front 
this is a sanctuary
for the ladies  where is he 
he s up in your office
with your husband 
misha  darling  i ll have you
out of here in 20 minutes 
rosalind  i ve got a spin
class in half an hour 
twenty minutes
and no charge 
lisa  champagne 
  mike  are you still there 
  of course i m still fucking here 
right  well  if you re still there 
who s ordering the fucking parts 
so what do you think 
ringing the bell 
but not too loud 
dipped in honey 
that s on the money 
but you always could make
a good cup of tea  mickey 
very nice 
hello  ros 
what the fuck
is going on in here 
i should have known
it was you behind this 
rodge is supposed to be
working down there
and you re up here
blowing his brains out 
  i m on it  boss 
  you wanna be 
don t blame the dodge 
dear 
you know he s got
a special nose
and he s doing
this old dog a favor 
dodge  get down there
and earn your money 
gone 
what you doing here anyway 
thought i d come by to have
a cup of tea with my wife 
well  go on  then 
put the kettle on 
looks like
the deal s gone through 
  second thoughts 
  no second thoughts 
i like middle age 
i like gentrification 
private schools  fine wines
and a spoonful of caviar
to help my medicine go down 
but most importantly  i m looking
forward to spending more time with you 
course you are 
look  i don t want you
knocking around here
feeling all unemployed
and lost with yourself 
well  fuck me 
most wives would beg
their other halves
to get out
of this game  but not you 
that s because
i know you  darling 
look  you ll have to
do this elegantly  love 
if word spreads that you re getting
out  that could read as weakness 
and if you smell smoke 
it s  cause there s a fire 
and that could
get expensive 
so you re gonna have to stamp that
out without any gentrification 
but not you  love 
don t you do anything messy 
that s why you ve
got people  remember 
i fucking love you  babe 
course you do 
any chance 
no  you can wait 
i ve got a red hot russki
with her finger on the trigger 
  gotta deal with it 
  i don t mind the two of yous 
go on  fuck off 
fletcher   
why are you
wasting our time 
i know what happens in my
world and what doesn t 
what i fail to recognize is
why michael should be motivated
to write you
a check for 20 million 
i find you very impatient  raymond 
i am a storyteller 
as they say in the film game 
i m laying pipe 
well  you d better put
something through it soon 
so what is that 
is that a barbecue as well 
  yes  it is  fletcher 
  i love a barbie 
that is a useful bit of plant 
then  isn t it 
so that heats up your knees
and cooks at the same time 
you gotta show me
how to get one of them 
well  you can take it with
you if you fuck off now 
ray 
is there any chance
of a steak 
yeah  all right  got a bit of
wagyu in the freezer as it happens 
  i ve never had wagyu 
  yeah  well  it ll be wasted on you  but it s all i ve got 
  i ll get it  mate 
  oh  no  you re all right 
  just stay right there 
  oh 
ow  fuck me 
it s hot 
he s a sly fox 
that fletcher 
night night  aslan 
32 ls engines 
you got all these parts
on a 40 foot container 
yeah 
how d you get
your hands on that 
ask no questions 
hear no lies 
hence the price 
  so how much 
  oh  no charge 
okay  so what s the price 
a meeting with your husband 
oh  fuck off 
that s not gonna happen 
it s in his interest 
tell you what  keep the parts 
consider it a gesture of goodwill 
you know
how to get hold of me 
well  i can t
promise anything 
dry eye  he got his little
sit down with michael  didn t he 
bold move  that 
coming in heavy 
sanctioned or unsanctioned   
by the dragon head himself 
lord george 
well  he s a naughty boy 
that george 
but dry eye 
oh  he s next generation 
and them chinamen  they upgrade
quicker than i fucking phones 
is he making moves 
is he breaking out on his own 
big man plans
behind lord george s back 
to be fair  it was very nicely played
with 100 grand s worth of free car parts 
because everyone knows that the way
to a man s heart is through his wife 
you d make a lovely wife 
raymond 
thank you for taking the time
to see me  michael 
lord george sends his best 
i only took this meeting
because ros asked me to 
make sure to never approach
her like that again 
i meant no disrespect 
how can i help 
i understand
you re getting out 
getting out 
getting out of what 
bed  my head 
the closet 
don t flirt with me  dry eye 
i m a busy man 
i hear you re
getting out of the game 
and i would like you
to consider an offer 
look  i m gonna stop you
right there
so you don t waste any more of
your precious breath  young man 
this is not a discussion
for the two of us 
unlike the salt and pepper 
it s not on the table 
this is a big number 
cash 
i am not for sale 
and even if i was 
you re several zeros short 
now  you may be able to buy
your man s sausage for that 
but to me it just looks
rude at breakfast 
you re out of touch 
you re forgetting the laws of the
jungle  looking down on me 
now  when the silverback s
got more silver than back   
he best move on   
before he gets moved on 
it s not dignified 
it s beneath you  michael 
trying to do you a favor 
this is a big fucking number 
and this 
this is a big fucking gun 
eyes not so dry now  are they 
hurts  does it 
you looking for your balls
or a hole in the wall 
  fuck 
  where the fuck do you think you re going 
because you re not going out the way you
came in  you deluded duck eating cunt 
talking to me about the laws of the jungle 
what was it  something
about being beneath me 
silver on back 
there s only one rule
in this fucking jungle 
when the lion s hungry 
he eats 
you re wrong  fletcher 
that s not how michael works 
yeah  i know  i know  i was
just having a bit of fun 
every movie needs
a bit of action  doesn t it 
and it s not like michael
doesn t have a reputation 
had a reputation 
he s been gentrified 
   big fucking number 
i know how you lot love fables 
so let me share a little fable with you 
there once was
a young and foolish dragon
who came to ask
a wise and cunning lion
about acquiring
his territory 
now  the lion  he wasn t interested 
so he told the little dragon to fuck off 
but the dragon couldn t
understand what  fuck off  meant 
so he persisted and
continued to ask the lion
about acquiring
his territory 
so the lion took
the little dragon for a walk
and put five bullets
in his little dragon head 
end of story 
now  allegedly
there s a message in there 
i don t know what it is 
but you re a clever boy  dry eye 
maybe you can
explain it to me 
i think your time s up 
chaps 
michael  you should recons   
just marinade on it 
in the meantime  fuck off 
oh  i bet mickey was pleased he
took that meeting  wasn t he 
yes  it went very well 
  yeah 
  do you want the top or the bottom 
the bottom  please  darling 
now  things started to unravel
after that meeting 
didn t mickey get a rat
infestation at one of his farms 
come on 
stealth  stealth 
go 
ballys down 
let s move  go  go  go  go 
shit

i ve gotta say 
i was impressed 
the way they fought 
they re on point  guvnor 
whoever trained them
knows what he s doing 
thank you 
that s enough 
  well  i m just saying 
  well  quit saying 
okay  thank you 
no sooner do i entertain
matthew s offer to buy me out
and reject dry eye s offer
does one of my farms
get raided 
first time ever 
doesn t feel like
a coincidence  does it 
it isn t 
there s fuckery afoot 
  how did they find it 
  i don t know 
i m making inquiries 
what about matthew 
he s gonna need reassuring
before he parts
with 400 big ones 
so many questions
unanswered  ray 
i mean  who d be smart enough
to find one of mickey s farms 
apart from me  of course 
and who would be bold enough
to make such a move 
especially to film it all
and then post it all online 
because that is really rubbing
your face in it  isn t it 
i m here to help  michael 
i m your friend  your ally 
your santa claus
for all seasons 
and i d like you to know my team
of elves can be very persuasive 
persuasive  and why
would i need persuasive 
well  i hear you might have
had a little trouble 
now  you helped me before
when my source ran dry 
so i m just returning
the favor and reminding you
i have effectual friends 
elves 
elves 
  yes  you said elves 
  did i 
mm 
no trouble over here  matthew 
no trouble at all 
so we brought you
a token 
you did 
and what might this be 
it s a paperweight to keep down all
the paper i m about to give you 
  well  it looks like a gun 
  and it s a paperweight 
seeing how in this country 
unlike in our homeland  they re illegal 
so is riding your bicycle
at night without lights 
laws are there
as a guideline 
in france  it s illegal
to call a pig napoleon 
but just try and stop me 
i quite like it 
you re very kind 
  thank you 
  hands across the sea 
mickey calmed down the jew
and it seems the deal
is still going ahead 
but bad timing  jeopardizing
deals  shutting down farms 
it could be an expensive disaster if
mickey doesn t get this cleaned up 
should i be scared 
i don t think so 
but i like to err on the side of caution 
what does that mean 
it means i m going to
have to close shop 
shut this farm down
and make it disappear 
you might see
a couple of trucks around here
over the next few days 
but that s it 
well  i m not gonna pretend
that missing out
on a million pounds commission a
year isn t going to hurt somewhat 
the pain is being shared 
stolen product 
loss of earnings meantime 
the cost of shutting down 
the expense of setting up elsewhere 
it s funny  really  but
it couldn t be worse timing 
how so 
i ve   
i ve just learned we need
a whole new roof apparently 
as i say  i m as upset
about this as you are 
  henry 
  mickey 
the toffs look after mickey 
now mickey looks after the toffs 
but there s a lot of toffs
to look after 
  henry 
  and when it rains   
let me take care of the roof 
   it fucking pours 
now  there s only one thing that
needs more looking after than a toff 
and that is
a toff s offspring 
which brings me neatly back
to big dave s story 
the very reason i m sitting
here sipping whiskey with you
in the first fucking place 
this is how big dave
is gonna bring mickey down 
by using and abusing lord
pressfield s much beloved child 
lord pressfield s daughter  the famous and
talented laura  all self hate and harm 
has fallen for this power
noel s smacked out dark charm 
and i want the lot of them 
especially that
slimy little jam rag pearson 
in bed with a skint 
discredited toff 
and supplying gear to young
and reckless rock star royals 
royals unbridled
by distracted parents
too busy skiing
on the swiss alps to notice
and too fucking stupid
to care 
i like it 
you re good at this  boss 
yeah  i know what i m good at 
hammy  fuck off 
aristocratic  junkie  bulimic 
auto tuned singing daughter
shacked up with some smacked out 
once upon a time pop star 
and all looked after
by mickey pearson 
i like it 
you know  i like it a lot 
we wrapped her
in cotton wool 
but she was
our little lor la 
charlie called her that because
she couldn t say laura at first 
we miss her terribly  mickey 
i ve failed as a parent 
you mustn t keep
beating yourself up  dear 
anne s right  charles 
you mustn t blame yourselves 
it sounds as though laura
fell in with the wrong crowd
at a time when she was
particularly vulnerable 
what more
could we do 
it s happened
to so many of our friends 
it s a curse 
  do you mind if i look into it 
  so you ll help us 
let me see what i can do 
you should get yourself
one of these  boss 
well  that s the plan 
everything all right 
you remember
their daughter 
yeah  laura 
nice girl  good voice 
teeny sort of spunk funk fuck pop 
shame about the habit 
she s gone missing  they ve asked
us to find her  bring her home 
mm hmm 
is that a problem 
well  i had a feeling
you might ask me this  boss 
so i did some due diligence 
i know where she is
and i don t like it 
  i d rather we didn t get involved 
  why not 
she s on
a south london council estate 
  so 
  it s out of our jurisdiction 
there s too many moving parts 
parts that we can t control 
what if she doesn t wanna come 
it s gonna get messy 
well  that may be true 
but you re still doing it 
i accept that 
but can t you
send frazier instead 
no  i can t
send frazier instead

  he can t do that  that s racist 
but  you are black and you are a
cunt  ernie  those are the facts 
i don t think primetime cares
what race you run in 
the fact that i m black has nothing
to do with the fact i m a cunt 
he didn t say black people
were cunts  ernie 
he was being specific to you 
one has nothing to do with the other 
and i d go a step further 
if i m not mistaken 
and say it was a term
of familiar affection 
primetime s a gypsy 
i wouldn t call him a pikey cunt 
why not  he might be
very understanding 
only if it comes from
a place of love  of course 
now  back to

face of a violent and expensive debt 
i m here
to see your boss 
feel free to talk 
i gather you re the
consigliere of the outfit
that my boys were stupid
enough to fuck around with 
on that note  i d like to extend
my apologies on their behalf 
my boys  they re naive 
they ve had hard lives and they re
just starting to come good 
but they re my lads 
my responsibility 
so it s me that should be
accountable for their actions 
now  i can return your goods 
but i can t return the inconvenience 
the time 
the fucking headache 
and so i offer you my loyalty 
my word  my time 
until that debt is settled 
i ll make amends 
but just leave me lads alone 
first of all  i m gonna need to know
how your lads got the information
about where our farm
was sited 
 cause that s not
common knowledge 
once we ve overcome that little
challenge  then we can talk 
well  i can do
better than that 
his name is phuc  but it s spelled with
a  ph   so it sounds like  fu uck  
so it s phu uc 
what 
yeah  something like that 
anyway  he s the kid that gave us
the skunk farm job  do you know him

lord george 
mr  pearson 
and to what do i owe 
what you watching 
i m watching the telly 
what you watching
on the telly 
i m watching
the horse racing 
live satellite
from hong kong 
my only vice 
well  that s not
strictly true  is it 
meaning 
meaning i ve always taken vice
to be the definition
of any criminal activity
or wicked behavior
involving prostitution 
pornography or drugs 
so  no   
racing is definitely not
your only vice  your lordship 
i d say you re eyebrows deep
in every vice known to man 
  there is a difference 
  being 
i facilitate  i don t participate
in any of the aforementioned vices 
what about tea 
what about tea 
well  that too is a vice 
caffeine is a drug 
don t you know 
so is that what you re here
to talk to me about  tea 
sweet mary jane is my vice
of choice  as you well know 
of course  i m addicted to
selling it  not consuming it 
i specifically chose
to deal in marijuana 
sure  i could see
there was more to be made
in shifting the white or the brown
powder  as you so chose 
but  you see  my jam 
it doesn t kill anyone 
and i like that 
while your poison   
is and always has been
a destroyer of worlds 
so  yes  your facilitation is
most definitely participation 
but i m not here to give you a
sermon on situational ethics 
so why the fuck
are you here 
you re starting a war
with me  george 
and i m trying to moonwalk
with elegance here 
but i m finding it
very fucking difficult 
laura 
i don t fuck around with puff 
you send your man dry eye
around my place
to see if he can buy
my business for a few beans 
laura 
you didn t
think i d find out 
having me followed
for months 
yeah  you crossed the line 
and that comes
with a price 
you raided
one of my locations 
you know the rules 
george 
what the fuck
were you thinking 
you raided one of
my locations 
what the fuck
were you thinking 
what the fuck
were you thinking  george 
should you
try and undermine me 
or should you attempt
to threaten my position again 
i will be forced to accept
your call to arms 
do you understand 
good 
now  i can see you re feeling
somewhat under the weather 
that s because
i spiked your tea
with a nasty little parasitic
genus called shigella 
left unattended  you will shit yourself
to death before the sun doth set 
i suggest taking
two of these fizzy biscuits 
you ll be fine
in an hour or two 
long enough to consider
your past indiscretions 
and  george  if i can get to
you in your own kitchen   
i can get to you anywhere 
  did you do it 
  do what 
did you raid
mickey pearson s farm 
  no 
  so you re telling me that phuc did this behind your back 
well  let s just say this 
he didn t do it in front of it 
he did it
without my blessing 
but you did go behind my back
and offer to buy his business 
yeah  yeah  i did 
now  let me warn you
the way you warn me 
there comes a point where
the young succeed the old 
don t push me 
there are some things
i don t know about 
something between dry eye
and lord george 
now  whatever it was 
someone killed lord george 
anyone else might think
that was you or mickey 
shall we continue
with our little story 
does that arouse
your interest  raymond 
so matthew knows dry eye 
  so what 
  well  yes  i agree 
perhaps they were
just meeting up
to talk about holidaying
in the maldives
or the long term implications
of leaving the eu 
but i filmed it  had it lip read 
translated and transcribed 
rather like the classic
1974 film the conversation 
starring gene hackman
and john cazale 
you know  coppola slipped that
one out between the godfathers 
it wasn t really for me 
it s a bit boring  to be honest 
now  can i just say  that matthew 
he s quite something  isn t he 
he s not
your average american 
he s a mr  international 
even speaks a bit of cantonese 
come here  you play dry eye
and i shall be matthew 
come on 
all right 
try and get it in time
with his lips  all right 
  yeah  yeah 
  ready 
roll camera  action 
there was an incident 
lord george   
fuck s sake  raymond 
it s a bit fucking wooden 
put something into it 
you know  a bit of welly 
and action 
there was an incident 
lord george
didn t come through it 
didn t come through it 
the last thing you need to do
is attract any octopus 
octopus 
what does that mean 
it s not a very good translation 
no  there s nothing wrong
with the translation 
matthew s not that fluent 
and it s cantonese 
just go with it
and fill in the blanks 
and action 
it s all on michael 
he s to blame 
that is not a smart move 
don t tell me
what a smart move is 
i beg for your pardon 
you heard me
perfectly well 
there will be repercussions
for michael s actions 
you think you re
running things  do you 
don t stroke my mouse hair 
  what does  mouse hair  mean 
  yeah  i think what he means is don t jeopardize my deal 
but i admit that one s
a bit of a googly 
then matthew loses it a bit
and his translation goes
completely out of the window 
something about springtime
and sweaters 
i think what he means
is he s upset 
and then dry eye
says something 
but some cunt
moved in front of me 
so i didn t get that
either 
your cantonese
is dog shit 
so i m gonna say this
in english
and i m gonna say it once 
so listen to me 
rubenstein 
this is how
it s gonna play out 
you re gonna
back the fuck off   
and i m gonna
take it all 
and you will pay me
my respect 
and there you have it 
that s all i ve got 
sorry  show s over 
but i think
it s quite clear
that they re not just
mah jongg partners  are they 
mm 
not all of that
was clear  fletcher 
i mean 
according to you 
we already know matthew
wants to buy michael out 
  so why is that news 
  oh  don t you worry  my darling 
we are gonna
come to the news 
i m approaching my climax 
dry eye 
i trust you will make
michael pearson pay for this 
you are
the dragon head now 
solidify your position 
it will be done  uncle 
so dry eye got the upgrade
he was after  didn t he  raymond 
the question is 
what was he gonna do with it
now that he s
billy big bollocks 
give me ten minutes 
ray 
boss 
hello  ros 
it s date night tonight 
9 00 p m   you and i 
river cafe 
nine o clock  i ll be there 
we re closed 
hang up 
no 
hang the fucking phone up 
who s there 
ros  who s there 
what you doing here 
dry eye 
it s warming up now 
isn t it 
at this point  i m guessing
that you didn t even know
that lord george
was dead yet 
let alone
what dry eye was up to 
hello  dry eye 
what do you want 
fancy a boiled sweet 
  no 
  suit yourself 
who the fuck was he 
i m not exactly
sure what happened next 
because you two managed
to give me the slip 
they got rosalind 
call roger 
oh  goody  another bottle 
hold on  you were there 
yeah 
of course i was there 
he s not picking up  maybe you
should put your seat belt on 
yeah  let me call rosalind 
let me do it 
i got it 
just watch the road 
now  rosalind  don t be alarmed 
but you re gonna
come with me
until i can resolve all these
issues with your husband 
i m not going anywhere 
she s not picking up 
it s just ringing 
  fuck 
  we could just slow down a little bit 
fuck 
you know how it works 
you either come with me or tony
here is gonna make you come with me 
you re in my office
under my roof 
it s not your position
for tony to do anything
other than to fuck off back
from whence he came 
tony 
what s that 
is that a paperweight 
funny you should say that  turns out
anything with weight can be a paperweight 
  what are you gonna do with it 
  well  that s up to you  isn t it 
either you do as i tell
you to and use the door 
or i m gonna shoot fat tony
right between the eyes 
you see  this gun s
only got two bullets 
so i m not gonna fuck about
illustrating its significance 
you re gonna have to
trust me on that 
the alternative
is a little bit absolute 
i m gonna have
to check your grammar on that 
it can t be
just a little bit absolute 
it either is or it isn t 
whatever it is 
i ve lost my patience 
i m telling you  i will squeeze this
trigger and tony will be no more 
tony 
listen to me  cunt 
you take one step forward 
it ll be the last fucking
step you ever take 
tony  get on it 
i fucking dare you 
just calm down 
i m leaving 
i guess that s
your two bullets  eh 
rosalind 
rosalind 
stay fucking still 
hello  babe 
hello  love 
so you re
basing your whole crescendo
on a figment
of your imagination 
i m basing my whole crescendo
on the sum of its parts 
a few minor details aside 
i wouldn t have any trouble at all
selling this juicy peach
of a drama to big dave 
he d cream
his fucking panties 
you re too smart to be
blackmailing us  fletcher 
yes  yes  and obviously i ve
taken precautionary measures 
you can do all kinds of
horrible things to me if you want 
i might even enjoy them 
but you d have to leave the
country and never come back 
so is that the story over
now  fletcher 
all this  this whole buildup 
was leading to this next part 
this is the news that
you were asking about before 
ready 
matthew 
he s gonna need some people
to run his business here
when he buys it
from michael  right 
he s gonna need a reliable pair of
hands  someone like you 
hmm  so why didn t he
ask you  raymond 
i don t know 
it s none of my business 
because  i ll tell you 
he already had someone
earmarked for the role 
dry eye 
he promised dry eye the job 
but only if dry eye helped drive
down the price of mickey s business 
you see  it was matthew who told dry
eye the location of mickey s farm 
so he could steal
his white widow super cheese
to cause ripples
and reduce the market value 
and that is why phuc 
in turn 
got those juice swilling 
acne backed muscle marys to do the job 
it was matthew
who set this whole
train of events off 
but what he did not
plan on  you see   
fuck you 
you old cunt 
i ll piss on your grave 
   was dry eye   
killing lord george 
now  dry eye does not want to be
subservient to matthew anymore 
doesn t wanna be
subservient to anyone 
this is how
it s gonna play out 
you re gonna
back the fuck off
and i m gonna
take it all 
dry eye likes the smell of
power and does not like matthew 
so  the little dragon needed a gentle
reminder of who was really running things 
you ve been in this paddling
pool for two minutes 
i ve been swimming in the ocean
with the sharks for 20 years 
i ll tell you
how this plays out 
you will drown   
and then my mossad crabs
will eat you 
and this  my love  is why i want
my hard earned 20 million pounds 
because not only do i know exactly
how mickey s business operates 
but i also know that the very
man he s trying to sell it to
is trying to force him
into selling it on the cheap
and has indirectly
started a war 
so  you see  i think you should be
calling me your trusted consigliere 
or your spy
behind the lines 
your intellectual
reconnaissance  if you prefer 
i m impressed 
you certainly know
more than i do 
i m impressed not only
by your information 
but by your imagination 
thank you very much 
so you ve got 72 hours 
and i would just reiterate
that if anything happens to me 
i do have my insurance policy
in place 
everything will go to big dave 
and from him to the public 
and you  my love 
will go to mars 
so  strong recommendation 
just pay up
and watch me recede into the
sunset blowing kisses  yes 
well  then  time to use the
door  you black bastard 
well  that s just silly  isn t
it   cause i m not black 
no  but your fucking soul is 
you dark cunt 
now  out of my house 
 cause i m going to bed 
can i come with you 
no  but you can go smoke the exhaust
pipe in the back of your hearse 
i might come anyway 
you ll just hear me
scratching about in the dark 
wanking into a hanky 
all right  so  20 million 
you ve got 72 hours 
starting now 
ticktock  ticktock 
and i m gone 
ticktock 
ticktock 
he s just left 
he thinks he s very clever 
start with big dave 
now  you keep this
between you and me  hammy 
but fletcher s been in touch 
he says he s got what we need 
careful  boss  fletcher s ass
belongs to the highest bidder 
yeah 
he says he wants 150 grand 
but if it s proper  it s worth
a whole week s exclusive 
well  what does he
have exactly 
he was just
tickling me nuts 
but he says
he wants to meet saturday 
so keep it free 
yeah  pronto 
oi  you can t park there

i just need
to get back to work 
if you let me go 
i ll just forget all about it 
i ll have you back to work
in short order  my friend 
now  i believe
you re a reporter 
and there s something
i wanna report to you 
now  it seems for
this brief moment in time
i ve found my way
into the film business 
and last night i made a film with
an impressively sized farmyard pig 
morning  sir 
two cups of tea 
one with sugar  one without 
all right  lads 
go on  give us a minute 
there are some wet
wipes there over your shoulder 
your clothes are neatly folded
there on the bench 
now  in due course  you re gonna
press the space bar on this computer
and you re gonna witness your
participation in said film 
now  that little drug we
gave you last night really   
loosened up
your inhibitions  man 
the only thing you ll need to do to
stop this little creative expression
from becoming
a social media sensation
is lose any interest you have
in the future of mickey pearson 
i m gonna leave you now
to clean yourself up 
space bar  yeah 
have a hot drink as well 
it might make you feel
a little bit better 
it was a fucking rough night
for you 
enjoy the show 
  old
macdonald had a farm  e i e i o  
  and on that farm he had a pig     
  how s your man  then  coach 
  ah  he ll survive 
wouldn t have been the pig i would have chosen  though 
we know what bit that is 
let me tickle that belly 
you are so naughty 
  good lord 
  i was there and i m still shocked 
squeal for me  piggy 
  is that who i think it is 
  yeah  it certainly is 
and that s your doing 
where is that applesauce 
you can t unsee it
once you ve seen it  can you 
no  you can t unsee it 
it s nightmare fuel 
that will be with me forever 
that story
won t be running 
right  i ve got one more
thing i need you to do 
ah  look 
before you continue  ray 
i train lads to be good lads 
i m not a fucking gangster 
now  i ve been forced to do some
gangster things  that s okay 
but i m not the gift
that keeps on giving 
so with the greatest respect 
i ll do this one last thing for you
and then that s it 
no más 
three strikes and i m out 
  everything all right  coach 
  no  ernie  it isn t 
you need to understand the
severity of your actions 
dave  an hour 
okay  boss 
thank you
for the grand tour 
i m a believer 
thank you  chaps 
now  are we ready
to finalize the numbers 
we already have 
mm   
the situation s changed 
michael 
  the market s changed 
  how so 
the exit value of your business
needs to be recalculated 
please  be specific 
oh  i will be 
you re asking 400 for 12 locations
and a distribution network 
which was a fair valuation
at the time 
but when one of those
locations was compromised 
the value of all those
locations were compromised
and this obviously
affects the price 
your skunk farm was a fucking viral
sensation on youtube  michael 
and when johnny law starts
sniffing  which he will 
all of those locations
will have to cease production
for  i d say  at least 12 months
at a cost of 100 million net p a  
before marking down the loss of
staff  relocation and site rentals 
  you still with me 
  yes  i m following 
it will take
at least three years
to get your supply  distribution
and demand back to full capacity 
your staffing costs are 25  of
your 100 million operational cost 
so that s 25 million per annum
for three annums 
and location rental
at 15 million a year 
that s a 120 gbp bite
right there 
your unit economics
have taken a hit 
and forecasting out your top line growth
margin in the current inimical climate 
i calculate what was worth
400 million a month ago
must now be valued
at an anemic  mm    130 
you see  it s not about the
first domino that fell  michael 
it s about the last 
please 
i like you  michael 
you re a good chap 
and if you want me to help you out of
this hole you ve found yourself in 
i can pay you
100 million dollars today 
it s a good offer
and it s real 
and i ll do this
because i m your friend 
my accountant can transfer
the fee within the hour 
i like your domino analogy 
the question i ask is 
who tumbled the first domino 
i m afraid that s not my
concern or my business  michael 
at the risk
of contradicting you 
it is very much your business 
and certainly your concern 
only you made one mistake 
that being 
you seem to have mistaken me
for some kind of a cunt 
let me introduce you
to the first domino 
it s a tad dramatic  isn t it 
corpses in freezers  who is this man 
what s he got to do with
anything that i m talking about 
i take it with that statement
you are in denial
of so said relationship
with this frozen chinaman 
well  of course
i m in denial of it 
i don t have relationships
with dead  frozen chinamen 
best not to be glib at this time
in the proceedings  matthew 
don t bother looking
for your mossad crabs 
this is a fish market 
they have found a home 
to be clear 
i do not know that man 
i ll tell you
how this plays out 
you will drown and then
my mossad crabs will eat you 
so while you were discussing
who would take over my business
after you fucked it 
you somehow mistook so said
chinaman for someone else 
business is business  michael 
it s nothing personal 
while i am not emotional
about the money 
there is a price indebted to me for
the blood i ve gotten on my hands
restoring order to the
untidiness that you created 
and that price 
according to you   
400 minus 130   
is 270 million dollars 
and i m keeping
the business 
while you are
getting in the freezer 
and you will make that transaction if
you want to get out of the freezer 
it is 25 below zero in there 
so i assume you ll last about an hour 
that said 
i wouldn t fuck about 
because frostbite is very
expensive on the fingers and toes 
so i would type as quickly as possible
while you have the use of them 
  uh   
  after you ve attended to that indiscretion 
you can then deal with the next
consequence of your shortsightedness 
as stated 
i am not emotional about the money 
but i am emotional about the fact that
someone laid their hands on my wife 
my wife 
no amount of money on god s green earth
can pay for that transgression  matthew 
no  for that   
i want a pound of flesh 
a pound of flesh 
it matters not to me
where on your anatomy
it is withdrawn from 
if you don t have the stomach
to take it for yourself 
big bunny here
is very adept with a knife 
and  as you can see 
he s dressed for the weather 
but a penny short
or a gram shy   
and that freezer door
does not open 
am i clear 
good 
  bunny 
  incoming 
what  is it wagyu again
for breakfast  raymond 
aren t you gonna introduce me to your
mysterious and slightly menacing friend 
what s that for 
is that for my money 
where s my money  raymond 
there s your payment 
go on  take a look 
thank you 
mysterious stranger 
well  that s disappointing   cause that
doesn t look like 20 million pounds 
it s more interesting than that 
your insurance policy 
all the photos  all the bodies 
all the skeletons  all the filth 
it s not the only one 
darling  i m not a mong 
what do you think s in that 
you fucking eejit 
of course we were
aware of what matthew was up to 
we re not complete
fucking idiots 
i ve been onto you
for a long time  fletcher 
i knew you d been following michael 
they re very similar 
our jobs 
only i m better at it
than you are 
i knew when you came over that night that
you d only be there for half an hour   
buenas tardes  raymondo 
   to tell me how clever you
are and try to blackmail us 
i ve got some very important
information to impart to you  raymond 
i also knew you couldn t
resist a  1500 single malt 
an  80 wagyu steak and a
state of the art smokeless barbie
  that even keeps your feet warm 
  i love a barbie 
i promise you  you will regret
this if you don t hear it 
and when the scotch
got into your cold veins 
you lost the benefit
of your sharp instincts 
oh  goody  another bottle 
can you tell the mysterious
gentleman to relax 
because i promise you  you will regret it
if you don t hear this  sit down  my love 
see  i kept you there  cause i needed
to know about matthew and dry eye 
took us a while to find
your insurance policies 
 cause you re
a naughty squirrel  fletcher 
fletcher  shoes off inside 
yes  mommy 
but it was made a lot easier after
i planted a tracker in your shoe 
you re never gonna be
a predator with us  fletcher 
you re always
gonna be prey 
so that s it  three strikes 
we re good  right 
  i ll see you around 
  with the greatest respect  i hope not 
now  fletcher 
what were you saying 
it wasn t
lord george that was after mickey 
or dry eye  or matthew 
do you wanna know who it was 
i ve got photos 
right 
you ve got 30 seconds 
thank you  darling 
fuck 
primetime 
what is it  son 
coach  we re gonna take
care of this for you 
ernie s got a plan 
what the fuck
are you talking about 
the michael situation 
we re gonna sort it 
primetime  listen    prime   
jesus 
now  you
remember aslan  don t you 
the young gentleman
you kept in the freezer 
well  this is aslan senior 
russian oligarch 
ex kgb  made all
his money in gas pipes 
and he s extremely sad that his
one and only son fell out of a window 
oh  shit 
and i fear that where
they failed before  raymond 
they re not gonna fail again 
and how do you know
all this 
because someone told them everything
they want to know about michael 
and that someone is me 
go on 
so i said i d tell them
where michael was for a price 
but that money was pending till
after  you know  the deed was done 
and then when they
messed up the first time 
i had a little rethink and came
up with my version 2 0 plan 
which is
when i came to see you 
you see  get my 20 mils
off michael first
and then  after the event 
get paid again  double bubble 
but you and your mysterious friend
put paid to that  so well done  you 
why did you just
look at your watch 
well  it s like i say 
the russians are gonna clean house 
and you are part of
that house  raymond 
they re gonna get michael when he comes
out of his meeting at the fish market 
and they are coming here 
so you see what i ve done there 
by telling you 
i ve saved your lives 
which i think in turn
saves mine  doesn t it 
don t fucking move 
dave 
dave 
no dave 
fuck 
fuck 
fuck 
so the toddlers
spray the car with bullets 
killing the russians 
the car rolls to a stop 
smash cut to black  titles 
so  what happened
to michael 
i need an ending 
no  no  no  my darling 
what you need   
is a sequel 
think it over  have a read 
you know my fee 
i m off to la la
to talk to the competition 
think about that 
got a plane to catch  and i m gone 
good afternoon

buenas tardes 
fletcher mondo 
raymond  well  well  well

aren t you 
now  i want you to play
a game with me  fletcher 
he s got fletcher 
if you wish to be
the king of the jungle 
it s not enough
to act like a king 
you must be the king 
and there can be no doubt
