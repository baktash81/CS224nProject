bobby
boss
ill have a pint
and a pickled egg
coming straight up
if you wish to be
the king of the jungle
its not enough
to act like a king
you must be the king
and there can be no doubt
because doubt causes chaos
and ones own demise
hello my love
its date night tonight
nine oclock
you and i river cafe
whos there
ros whos there
chink chink
fletcher
buenas tardes raymondo
i should stab you with
that fucking rolling pin
oh dont be cunty i was just hoping we
could have a cozy little drink together
so ive got a meeting on saturday
at your favorite newspaper
as the best private investigator
in this smoky little town
good evening
ladies and gentlemen
they are ready to put 150 grand in
my pocket to give them some filth
good for me that
but in this case
its bad for you
so big dave
editor extraordinaire
has developed a terrible
antipathy for your boss
and his liquorish assortment
of tasty mates
hes out to destroy him and all those
that cozy up to him front cover bosh
there will be blood and fucking
feathers everywhere my darling
get to it fletcher
im starting to itch
now we both know that your boss has
very very deep pockets
and i would like to invite him just
to have a teeny rummage in them
what the fuck
are you talking about
if you would be so kind
as to furnish me with
20 million british pounds
i will give you everything
memory cards contact sheets
recordings the lot
and a modest little screenplay
i wrote all by myself
hold on
we just went from 150000
to 20 million
thats a steep rise
in 30 seconds
yeah but i would argue that youre
lucky because that is nothing
compared to what i could
and perhaps should be asking
oh well thank god
youre not greedy fletcher
you deluded
shiteating cunt
i quite like it
when you talk dirty to me
i can feel myself engorging
come on have a drink with me
its really yummy
i looked it up apped it
1500 quid
i didnt know you could spend
that much on a bottle of scotch
im gonna tell you a story to
demonstrate why my quote is my quote
will you play a game
with me ray
i dont wanna play a game
please
no
i said play a fucking game
with me ray
right
lovely
now i want you
to imagine a character
a dramatic character
like in a book or a play or a film
but not digital
not on a memory stick
analog chemical process
keep the grain in the picture i say
oldschool 35 mill
now im seeing this
through a lens i am
and im not talking about
the small screen
its not tv raymond
as i said
oldschool cinema format
its what we in the business called
anamorphic or ratio 235 to 1
and i want you to join me
on this cinematic journey
cause it is cinema ray
its beautiful
beautiful cinema
now roll camera
enter our protagonist
hes goodlooking
hes gorgeous
hes golden age
hes a proper handsome cunt
his name is mickey pearson
unique background
has our mickey
american born rhodes scholar
so hes born clever but poor
now thats quite a leap from
a trailer park in americana
to the thousandyearold
university in old angleterre
where he studies
the dark art of horticulture
but he never finished his education
never went home because
he found his vocation
a naughty vocation
hes a bad boy
he starts dealing
the dirty wonder weed
to his rich british
upperclass uni pals
and realizes
hes rather good at it
hes clear and objective
about ambition
and he can surf the echelons
of our complicated culture
he knew how to take advantage
of his advantage
he was a hungry animal
you see
he was powerful and ruthless
cunning and quick
charismatic and smart but
he had to do some naughty
things to get where he got
to establish his position
to show he wasnt just
teeth tits and tan
well he wasnt
fucking hollow was he
he had an engine
under his hood
and a gun in his holster
so hes not exactly clean
our mickey
he has come up the hard way
hes earned his position
shall we say
well that was the early days
and he cracked on with
his new world pioneer spirit
whats he worth today
100 200 500 million
but now the plot
begins to thicken
he has reached
a crossroads in his life
the middle class and the middle
age theyve got to him
theyve corrupted his appetite
for the horrors hes gone soft
he wanted to cash in his chips
and get out of the game
and he seems to have found
the perfect customer
smash cut please
to interior a gala dinner
just a few words to say
thank you to michael pearson
for his limitless generosity
and time
now mickey has been cultivating
a special relationship
with the erudite learned and
broadminded matthew berger
yes raymond i do know about
the jewish billionaire cowboy
another slice of americana
creating drama in angleterre
and finally to matthew berger
blindsiding us with his donation
to build the entire cognitive
behavioral therapy unit
so these two have met before
fuck knows where
presumably at the annual international
drug dealers convention in las vegas
and theyve done
some small deals together
but now theyre ready
for the big one
well that was unexpected
matthew
now i understand why youre
seated at the head of the table
snuck that one right by me didnt
you you naughty little girl
making a splash
with the gentry
oh i like to make a splash
whenever possible
well you also seem to understand
the significance of a proper attire
indeed i do
i believe
a sense of ownership
is vital
in every aspect of life
perhaps never more so than
when it comes to wardrobe
for every look there is a season
and for every season a strategy
now starts the alpha dance
theyre not really talking
about clothes raymond
oh fucking no
theyre like
a pair of old doggies
sniffing round one anothers
intellectual assholes
its a good oldfashioned
cockoff raymond
michael im looking forward
to doing business together
may we excuse ourselves
yes please
we should say good night
to our host
so what do you think
im not sure
your grace
hes a fox
and foxes
have a predictable nature
trust this jew
about that jew
if you let him
in the henhouse
you can expect blood
and feathers everywhere
fresh from
a farmyard pheasant shoot
these two are starting
to like each other
its looking good ray
its looking fucking good
im impressed with what youve done with your enterprise
you see try as i might
i cant work out how you do it
and bush is my game
how does anyone grow
50 tons of super skunk
without letting anyone else
know how they do it
im flattered to hear that
from you matthew
i imagine that big brain of yours
is sweating a stream of tears
just trying
to figure it out
brilliance
should be acknowledged
mm
run the numbers
by me again
200 million gross pa
100 million net
but your people
know this already
theyve swept the numbers
for months now
the bottom line is ill sell
it to you for 400 million
but you knew that already
hop in
now i cant be specific
about the heroes and zeros
but there was a lot of money
hanging in the balance
question what would it be
worth to have the power
to be able to pull the plug
on an operation like that
answer a greedy man would
want half the sale price
but a smart man would know
that 20 million pounds
was just about uncomfortable enough
to make everyone feel comfortable
youre a cunning and creative
toad arent you fletcher
coming up
with a plan like this
yeah but i didnt really
come up with it did i
it was big dave
he commissioned me
to do a job on mickey
you know sniff about
keep an eye on him
go through his bins
reveal his sins
mickey pearson the odious yankee gangster
were gonna bury him
because it seems hes got himself
a new friend lord pressfield
question
is that the lord pressfield
his grace the duke
yeah once fourth in line
to the throne
apparently mickey pearson
has squeaked his way
into the crack
of his fat posh ass
this is yours fletcher i need a man
with your creativity with your nose
now you know
youre my favorite bloodhound
i just think its really
important to remember
who youre talking to dave
of course i remember
fletcher
so just make absolutely sure the
check doesnt disappoint this time
the number is 150000
he wants to ruin him
but i am here
to do you a favor
and its not like youre not
getting something for your money
you could even turn that script
into a feature film raymond
we could make it together
we could be partners
i have learned off you lot
you gotta look after number
one and now its my turn
the sun is not going up
for me ray its going down
so why has big dave
got it in for my boss
two months ago
your man mickey
made my man dave feel
like a right fucking idiot
henry mickey
how did he do that
didnt accept his hand
dave daily print
yes
no editor
of the daily print
turns out dave had
gone after one of mickeys lords
did a proper tabloid job
on him
it would appear that his
lordship had had a quick spin
on one of
his attractive young footmen
after the splash shares
crashed job went wife followed
and even his kids
disowned him
well that dave
cant half be a cunt
but no one
will pull him on it
too fucking scared that dave
will do a feature on them
but your mickey hes got
a fabulous set of balls
so he snubbed him in front of a crowd
that dave could only wish he belonged to
you know lords and ladies the sort that
mickey feels very comfortable in front of
men excuse us
well he might just as
well have pulled daves cock off
i do believe that was a bit
of a fuck off dave
cause he just
fizzled like a party balloon
thats no reason
to go after a fella
well i dont know what to tell you
he wants mickeys blood
and he would be getting it
too if it wasnt for
youre a filthy fantasist
and now its time to leave
oh dont be silly
im only just lubing you up
now there is a reason why matthew
or anyone else for that matter
cannot work out
how mickey does what he does
how does he grow 50 tons of white
widow super cheese every year
everyone knows
that needs a lot of space
so where is the space and how
come hes kept it under wraps
you cant just dig a hole in the ground
and drop 200 shipping containers in there
oh no my love
that will not work
no you have to be creative
you need an angle
the problem with land in this
country is theres not much of it
and theres public access even
when its supposed to be private
and the public have rights
dog walkers
yes jog on
footpaths right to roam
bimblers ramblers
badger lovers
and any other busy cunt
with enough time on his hands
to sniff
the green tweed of england
good morning
and they have groups
forums meetings
social media
and they love
a good chat and a hiss
about anyone whos decided to
mow his lawn without a license
and then theres the helicopters
drones google earth
heritage sites
parish councils
and the beat goes on
and thats before you even think
about getting power in here
so what is
mickeys unique method
i tip my cap at the cheek
at the elegance at the class
and what would
that method be exactly
you have to understand
a culture to understand a man
toffs aristocrats
dukes duchesses
lords and ladies
lots of land
and fuck all dough
houses to keep damp to
keep out silver to polish
you must remember
that cash is very persuasive
to the class that got spanked by
angry lefties and death duties
and every time you inherit a
fortune you lose half to the state
so this is my moment to swoop in
like a guardian fucking angel
and offer my services so they
can keep their houses in order
and theyre not too bothered
about what i do
as long as that cash
keeps rolling in each year
its good to get a lord yes
but its not easy
it takes work
wine women and disco
twelve sites twelve farms
one thousand of these estates
in the great uk
bonne chance
trying to find them all
thats it my infrastructure
and that sir is with my
blessing what you are paying for
if its as discreet and as
lucrative as you claim it is
ill buy the whole business
but enough foreplay michael
i wanna see your plant
ive gone to great lengths
to make my operation
as invisible as possible
matthew
if you were standing on my
bush you wouldnt know it
as a matter of fact
you are standing on my bush
its a spectacular business
michael
such a shame it will go
bankrupt in ten years
when things go legal
in the great uk
and you want me
to pay top dollar for it
a nugget under half a yard
that is the price
now step inside and ill show
you what half a yard gets you
ooh a delightful tool shed
for 400 million dollars
is the ballpeen hammer
included
course it is
now let me show you the nails
watch your head
carry on chaps
englands
green and pleasant land
those are some nails
location staff technology
see youre buying the substructure
for the superstructure to come
and with purchase you will
inherit the best sites available
the finest botanists and herb
sommeliers in the world
as well as the most innovative
marijuana technology on the planet
and when this little piggy
goes to legal market
and the demand
way outpaces the supply
these locations
these greenfingered botanical boys
as well as
my superior technology
will be at a premium
and you would own them all
did you know it took 15 years after
alcohol prohibition ended back home
for the legal market
to scratch that itch
fifteen years
and thats if
you do nothing with it
yes its a winwin
no matter how you look at it
and im not greedy
you and i both know
that 400 million is a
fairtogenerous asking price
especially considering
that once this games kosher
its going to be worth
somewhere between 200 billion
and well
half a trillion pounds
annually
weed
bush
skunkamola
white widow super cheese
its the new gold rush
this is the thin end
of a very fat wedge sir
if its such a fat wedge
why dont you keep it
you see ive developed a reputation
as a man who came up the hard way
you could say that theres blood
on these pretty white hands
but in the new business
once legal and under the jurisdiction
of the respectable umbrella
of ministerial legitimacy
an enterprise like this will
need a face with a clean past
which sadly i do not possess
retirement
doesnt sound so bad
long walks in the countryside
pruning roses with my better half
raising some cubs
ive earned it
look we both know growing
is only 50 of the business
i need
your european connections
ive seen
how the sausage is made
now tell me
about the butcher shops
well that comes later
matthew
when the moneys in escrow
now that weve established
the dilemma of our protagonist
let us turn to our antagonist
many miles away
across the open plains
another beautiful feral beast
lopes his way to a watering hole
who are you talking about
now
i talk raymondo of dry eye
oh dry eye
what is he
chinese japanese pekingese
get on your fucking knees
dirty dragon filth
yellow is the color
gambling is the game
he explodes on the scene like a millennial
fucking firecracker bang bang bang
you cheebye motherfuckers
im gonna have to
stop you right there fletcher
that doesnt sound like
the dry eye i know
just making sure youre
paying attention raymond
so lets cut instead
to a somewhat anticlimactic
but suave and debonair
dry eye
like a chinese james bond
ricense to kill
open them up
yes boss
good lord
hose them down load them up
and fuck them off
let me have a look at 432
yes boss its just right here
theres 120 rims uh
32 ls engines 60 custom
all right pay the man
sorry chaps i quoted you for
a 20 when its a 40footer
its gonna be double bubble
double bubble
a gentlemans quote
is a gentlemans word
now either you or your family are
gonna have to pay for that lesson
do we have an understanding
yes boss
give the soppy prick
his money
anyway
lets put a pin in dry eye
and turn again to mickey
if youre thinking
of smoking that in here
dont
i find that confusing
do you mean dont smoke
or dont think
oh
oh all right all right
its going out
i think the time has come
for me to introduce you to our queen
harold bag
a cockney cleopatra
to mickeys cowboy caesar
the only weak link in his
otherwise impregnable armor
is his devotion his passion
some would say his obsession
with his beauteous lady wife
im trying to do you
a favor here mike
but every time i do you a favor
it ends up costing me too
now come on ros
why is miss kova still here
that range was supposed
to be finished this morning
im not talking to you mike
sorry boss rodge is on the range
how many times have i told you
i dont want roger up front
this is a sanctuary
for the ladies where is he
hes up in your office
with your husband
misha darling ill have you
out of here in 20 minutes
rosalind ive got a spin
class in half an hour
twenty minutes
and no charge
lisa champagne
mike are you still there
of course im still fucking here
right well if youre still there
whos ordering the fucking parts
so what do you think
ringing the bell
but not too loud
dipped in honey
thats on the money
but you always could make
a good cup of tea mickey
very nice
hello ros
what the fuck
is going on in here
i should have known
it was you behind this
rodge is supposed to be
working down there
and youre up here
blowing his brains out
im on it boss
you wanna be
dont blame the dodge
dear
you know hes got
a special nose
and hes doing
this old dog a favor
dodge get down there
and earn your money
gone
what you doing here anyway
thought id come by to have
a cup of tea with my wife
well go on then
put the kettle on
looks like
the deals gone through
second thoughts
no second thoughts
i like middle age
i like gentrification
private schools fine wines
and a spoonful of caviar
to help my medicine go down
but most importantly im looking
forward to spending more time with you
course you are
look i dont want you
knocking around here
feeling all unemployed
and lost with yourself
well fuck me
most wives would beg
their other halves
to get out
of this game but not you
thats because
i know you darling
look youll have to
do this elegantly love
if word spreads that youre getting
out that could read as weakness
and if you smell smoke
its cause theres a fire
and that could
get expensive
so youre gonna have to stamp that
out without any gentrification
but not you love
dont you do anything messy
thats why youve
got people remember
i fucking love you babe
course you do
any chance
no you can wait
ive got a redhot russki
with her finger on the trigger
gotta deal with it
i dont mind the two of yous
go on fuck off
fletcher
why are you
wasting our time
i know what happens in my
world and what doesnt
what i fail to recognize is
why michael should be motivated
to write you
a check for 20 million
i find you very impatient raymond
i am a storyteller
as they say in the film game
im laying pipe
well youd better put
something through it soon
so what is that
is that a barbecue as well
yes it is fletcher
i love a barbie
that is a useful bit of plant
then isnt it
so that heats up your knees
and cooks at the same time
you gotta show me
how to get one of them
well you can take it with
you if you fuck off now
ray
is there any chance
of a steak
yeah all right got a bit of
wagyu in the freezer as it happens
ive never had wagyu
yeah well itll be wasted on you but its all ive got
ill get it mate
oh no youre all right
just stay right there
oh
ow fuck me

hes a sly fox
that fletcher
nightnight aslan
32 ls engines
you got all these parts
on a 40foot container
yeah
howd you get
your hands on that
ask no questions
hear no lies
hence the price
so how much
oh no charge
okay so whats the price
a meeting with your husband
oh fuck off
thats not gonna happen
its in his interest
tell you what keep the parts
consider it a gesture of goodwill
you know
how to get hold of me
well i cant
promise anything
dry eye he got his little
sitdown with michael didnt he
bold move that
coming in heavy
sanctioned or unsanctioned
by the dragon head himself
lord george
well hes a naughty boy
that george
but dry eye
oh hes next generation
and them chinamen they upgrade
quicker than ifuckingphones
is he making moves
is he breaking out on his own
big man plans
behind lord georges back
to be fair it was very nicely played
with 100 grands worth of free car parts
because everyone knows that the way
to a mans heart is through his wife
youd make a lovely wife
raymond
thank you for taking the time
to see me michael
lord george sends his best
i only took this meeting
because ros asked me to
make sure to never approach
her like that again
i meant no disrespect
how can i help
i understand
youre getting out
getting out
getting out of what
bed my head
the closet
dont flirt with me dry eye
im a busy man
i hear youre
getting out of the game
and i would like you
to consider an offer
look im gonna stop you
right there
so you dont waste any more of
your precious breath young man
this is not a discussion
for the two of us
unlike the salt and pepper
its not on the table
this is a big number
cash
i am not for sale
and even if i was
youre several zeros short
now you may be able to buy
your mans sausage for that
but to me it just looks
rude at breakfast
youre out of touch
youre forgetting the laws of the
jungle looking down on me
now when the silverbacks
got more silver than back
he best move on
before he gets moved on
its not dignified
its beneath you michael
trying to do you a favor
this is a big fucking number
and this
this is a big fucking gun
eyes not so dry now are they
hurts does it
you looking for your balls
or a hole in the wall
fuck
where the fuck do you think youre going
because youre not going out the way you
came in you deluded duckeating cunt
talking to me about the laws of the jungle
what was it something
about being beneath me
silver on back
theres only one rule
in this fucking jungle
when the lions hungry
he eats
youre wrong fletcher
thats not how michael works
yeah i know i know i was
just having a bit of fun
every movie needs
a bit of action doesnt it
and its not like michael
doesnt have a reputation
had a reputation
hes been gentrified
big fucking number
i know how you lot love fables
so let me share a little fable with you
there once was
a young and foolish dragon
who came to ask
a wise and cunning lion
about acquiring
his territory
now the lion he wasnt interested
so he told the little dragon to fuck off
but the dragon couldnt
understand what fuck off meant
so he persisted and
continued to ask the lion
about acquiring
his territory
so the lion took
the little dragon for a walk
and put five bullets
in his little dragon head
end of story
now allegedly
theres a message in there
i dont know what it is
but youre a clever boy dry eye
maybe you can
explain it to me
i think your times up
chaps
michael you should recons
just marinade on it
in the meantime fuck off
oh i bet mickey was pleased he
took that meeting wasnt he
yes it went very well

well quit saying
okay thank you
no sooner do i entertain
matthews offer to buy me out
and reject dry eyes offer
does one of my farms
get raided
first time ever
doesnt feel like
a coincidence does it
it isnt
theres fuckery afoot
how did they find it
i dont know
im making inquiries
what about matthew
hes gonna need reassuring
before he parts
with 400 big ones
so many questions
unanswered ray
i mean whod be smart enough
to find one of mickeys farms
apart from me of course
and who would be bold enough
to make such a move
especially to film it all
and then post it all online
because that is really rubbing
your face in it isnt it
im here to help michael
im your friend your ally
your santa claus
for all seasons
and id like you to know my team
of elves can be very persuasive
persuasive and why
would i need persuasive
well i hear you might have
had a little trouble
now you helped me before
when my source ran dry
so im just returning
the favor and reminding you
i have effectual friends
elves
elves
yes you said elves
did i
mm
no trouble over here matthew
no trouble at all
so we brought you
a token
you did
and what might this be
its a paperweight to keep down all
the paper im about to give you
well it looks like a gun
and its a paperweight
seeing how in this country
unlike in our homeland theyre illegal
so is riding your bicycle
at night without lights
laws are there
as a guideline
in france its illegal
to call a pig napoleon
but just try and stop me
i quite like it
youre very kind
thank you
hands across the sea
mickey calmed down the jew
and it seems the deal
is still going ahead
but bad timing jeopardizing
deals shutting down farms
it could be an expensive disaster if
mickey doesnt get this cleaned up
should i be scared
i dont think so
but i like to err on the side of caution
what does that mean
it means im going to
have to close shop
shut this farm down
and make it disappear
you might see
a couple of trucks around here
over the next few days
but thats it
well im not gonna pretend
that missing out
on a million pounds commission a
year isnt going to hurt somewhat
the pain is being shared
stolen product
loss of earnings meantime
the cost of shutting down
the expense of setting up elsewhere
its funny really but
it couldnt be worse timing
how so
ive
ive just learned we need
a whole new roof apparently
as i say im as upset
about this as you are
henry
mickey
the toffs look after mickey
now mickey looks after the toffs
but theres a lot of toffs
to look after
henry
and when it rains
let me take care of the roof
it fucking pours
now theres only one thing that
needs more looking after than a toff
and that is
a toffs offspring
which brings me neatly back
to big daves story
the very reason im sitting
here sipping whiskey with you
in the first fucking place
this is how big dave
is gonna bring mickey down
by using and abusing lord
pressfields muchbeloved child
lord pressfields daughter the famous and
talented laura all selfhate and harm
has fallen for this power
noels smackedout dark charm
and i want the lot of them
especially that
slimy little jam rag pearson
in bed with a skint
discredited toff
and supplying gear to young
and reckless rockstar royals
royals unbridled
by distracted parents
too busy skiing
on the swiss alps to notice
and too fucking stupid
to care
i like it
youre good at this boss
yeah i know what im good at
hammy fuck off
aristocratic junkie bulimic
autotuned singing daughter
shacked up with some smackedout
onceuponatime pop star
and all looked after
by mickey pearson
i like it
you know i like it a lot
we wrapped her
in cotton wool
but she was
our little lorla
charlie called her that because
she couldnt say laura at first
we miss her terribly mickey
ive failed as a parent
you mustnt keep
beating yourself up dear
annes right charles
you mustnt blame yourselves
it sounds as though laura
fell in with the wrong crowd
at a time when she was
particularly vulnerable
what more
could we do
its happened
to so many of our friends
its a curse
do you mind if i look into it
so youll help us
let me see what i can do
you should get yourself
one of these boss
well thats the plan
everything all right
you remember
their daughter
yeah laura
nice girl good voice
teeny sort of spunkfunk fuck pop
shame about the habit
shes gone missing theyve asked
us to find her bring her home
mmhmm
is that a problem
well i had a feeling
you might ask me this boss
so i did some due diligence
i know where she is
and i dont like it
id rather we didnt get involved
why not
shes on
a south london council estate
so
its out of our jurisdiction
theres too many moving parts
parts that we cant control
what if she doesnt wanna come
its gonna get messy
well that may be true
but youre still doing it
i accept that
but cant you
send frazier instead
no i cant
send frazier instead
youre my best man
i want you
its just that
i dont like smackies
its the filth and the grime
and the grub in the tub
im not asking your ocd to spend
the weekend with them ray

did he just call me
a black cunt
yes he did
he cant do that thats racist
but you are black and you are a
cunt ernie those are the facts
i dont think primetime cares
what race you run in
the fact that im black has nothing
to do with the fact im a cunt
he didnt say black people
were cunts ernie
he was being specific to you
one has nothing to do with the other
and id go a step further
if im not mistaken
and say it was a term
of familiar affection
primetimes a gypsy
i wouldnt call him a pikey cunt
why not he might be
very understanding
only if it comes from
a place of love of course
now back to
the issue at hand
i need that chinese
geezers address okay
youll have it
by the morning coach
good lad
and coach

the fucking time
to keep your cards
close to your chest
just tell me his name
isnt mickey pearson
blimey coach
are you a gypsy too
you been reading tea leaves
got a crystal ball
that is not good news
ernie
mickey pearson is terrible news in the
face of a violent and expensive debt
im here
to see your boss
feel free to talk
i gather youre the
consigliere of the outfit
that my boys were stupid
enough to fuck around with
on that note id like to extend
my apologies on their behalf
my boys theyre naive
theyve had hard lives and theyre
just starting to come good
but theyre my lads
my responsibility
so its me that should be
accountable for their actions
now i can return your goods
but i cant return the inconvenience
the time
the fucking headache
and so i offer you my loyalty
my word my time
until that debt is settled
ill make amends
but just leave me lads alone
first of all im gonna need to know
how your lads got the information
about where our farm
was sited
cause thats not
common knowledge
once weve overcome that little
challenge then we can talk
well i can do
better than that
his name is phuc but its spelled with
a ph so it sounds like fuuck
so its phuuc
what
yeah something like that
anyway hes the kid that gave us
the skunk farm job do you know him
yeah weve met before
havent we phuuc phuc
thats the one
phuuc
phuc
phuc
all right
dont do anything stupid now
son right
how did you know
the location
i need my inhaler
yeah in a minute
i need you to tell me how you
knew the location of our farm
ive been trailing you for months
dry eye was given the address
i cant breathe
i need it please
all right phuc
calm the fuuck down
right here steady yourself
for fucks sake
sort him out
all right
here here look at me
you all right
yeah
wheres your inhaler
there
right here take a blim
now good boy there you go son
you all right
fuck
no stop dont
fucks sake ray you need
to invest in some parachutes
theres a pattern
emerging here
im sorry boss
and whos this
jumping phuc boy anyway
its dry eyes man
you mean lord georges man
it could just be dry eyes doing
hes been getting bold lately
yeah well
they still all work for lord george
im gonna take care
of this one myself
lord george
mr pearson
and to what do i owe
what you watching
im watching the telly
what you watching
on the telly
im watching
the horse racing
live satellite
from hong kong
my only vice
well thats not
strictly true is it
meaning
meaning ive always taken vice
to be the definition
of any criminal activity
or wicked behavior
involving prostitution
pornography or drugs
so no
racing is definitely not
your only vice your lordship
id say youre eyebrows deep
in every vice known to man
there is a difference
being
i facilitate i dont participate
in any of the aforementioned vices
what about tea
what about tea
well that too is a vice
caffeine is a drug
dont you know
so is that what youre here
to talk to me about tea
sweet mary jane is my vice
of choice as you well know
of course im addicted to
selling it not consuming it
i specifically chose
to deal in marijuana
sure i could see
there was more to be made
in shifting the white or the brown
powder as you so chose
but you see my jam
it doesnt kill anyone
and i like that
while your poison
is and always has been
a destroyer of worlds
so yes your facilitation is
most definitely participation
but im not here to give you a
sermon on situational ethics
so why the fuck
are you here
youre starting a war
with me george
and im trying to moonwalk
with elegance here
but im finding it
very fucking difficult
laura
i dont fuck around with puff
you send your man dry eye
around my place
to see if he can buy
my business for a few beans
laura
you didnt
think id find out
having me followed
for months
yeah you crossed the line
and that comes
with a price
you raided
one of my locations
you know the rules
george
what the fuck
were you thinking
you raided one of
my locations
what the fuck
were you thinking
what the fuck
were you thinking george
should you
try and undermine me
or should you attempt
to threaten my position again
i will be forced to accept
your call to arms
do you understand
good
now i can see youre feeling
somewhat under the weather
thats because
i spiked your tea
with a nasty little parasitic
genus called shigella
left unattended you will shit yourself
to death before the sun doth set
i suggest taking
two of these fizzy biscuits
youll be fine
in an hour or two
long enough to consider
your past indiscretions
and george if i can get to
you in your own kitchen
i can get to you anywhere
did you do it
do what
did you raid
mickey pearsons farm
no
so youre telling me that phuc did this behind your back
well lets just say this
he didnt do it in front of it
he did it
without my blessing
but you did go behind my back
and offer to buy his business
yeah yeah i did
now let me warn you
the way you warn me
there comes a point where
the young succeed the old
dont push me
there are some things
i dont know about
something between dry eye
and lord george
now whatever it was
someone killed lord george
anyone else might think
that was you or mickey
shall we continue
with our little story
does that arouse
your interest raymond
so matthew knows dry eye
so what
well yes i agree
perhaps they were
just meeting up
to talk about holidaying
in the maldives
or the longterm implications
of leaving the eu
but i filmed it had it lipread
translated and transcribed
rather like the classic
1974 film the conversation
starring gene hackman
and john cazale
you know coppola slipped that
one out between the godfathers
it wasnt really for me
its a bit boring to be honest
now can i just say that matthew
hes quite something isnt he
hes not
your average american
hes a mr international
even speaks a bit of cantonese
come here you play dry eye
and i shall be matthew
come on
all right
try and get it in time
with his lips all right
yeah yeah
ready
roll camera action
there was an incident
lord george
fucks sake raymond
its a bit fucking wooden
put something into it
you know a bit of welly
and action
there was an incident
lord george
didnt come through it
didnt come through it
the last thing you need to do
is attract any octopus
octopus
what does that mean
its not a very good translation
no theres nothing wrong
with the translation
matthews not that fluent
and its cantonese
just go with it
and fill in the blanks
and action
its all on michael
hes to blame
that is not a smart move
dont tell me
what a smart move is
i beg for your pardon
you heard me
perfectly well
there will be repercussions
for michaels actions
you think youre
running things do you
dont stroke my mouse hair
what does mouse hair mean
yeah i think what he means is dont jeopardize my deal
but i admit that ones
a bit of a googly
then matthew loses it a bit
and his translation goes
completely out of the window
something about springtime
and sweaters
i think what he means
is hes upset
and then dry eye
says something
but some cunt
moved in front of me
so i didnt get that
either
your cantonese
is dog shit
so im gonna say this
in english
and im gonna say it once
so listen to me
rubenstein
this is how
its gonna play out
youre gonna
back the fuck off
and im gonna
take it all
and you will pay me
my respect
and there you have it
thats all ive got
sorry shows over
but i think
its quite clear
that theyre not just
mahjongg partners are they
mm
not all of that
was clear fletcher
i mean
according to you
we already know matthew
wants to buy michael out
so why is that news
oh dont you worry my darling
we are gonna
come to the news
im approaching my climax
dry eye
i trust you will make
michael pearson pay for this
you are
the dragon head now
solidify your position
it will be done uncle
so dry eye got the upgrade
he was after didnt he raymond
the question is
what was he gonna do with it
now that hes
billy big bollocks
give me ten minutes
ray
boss
hello ros
its date night tonight
900 pm you and i
river cafe
nine oclock ill be there
were closed
hang up
no
hang the fucking phone up
whos there
ros whos there
what you doing here
dry eye
its warming up now
isnt it
at this point im guessing
that you didnt even know
that lord george
was dead yet
let alone
what dry eye was up to
hello dry eye
what do you want
fancy a boiled sweet
no
suit yourself
who the fuck was he
im not exactly
sure what happened next
because you two managed
to give me the slip
they got rosalind
call roger
oh goody another bottle
hold on you were there
yeah
of course i was there
hes not picking up maybe you
should put your seat belt on
yeah let me call rosalind
let me do it
i got it
just watch the road
now rosalind dont be alarmed
but youre gonna
come with me
until i can resolve all these
issues with your husband
im not going anywhere
shes not picking up
its just ringing
fuck
we could just slow down a little bit
fuck
you know how it works
you either come with me or tony
here is gonna make you come with me
youre in my office
under my roof
its not your position
for tony to do anything
other than to fuck off back
from whence he came
tony
whats that
is that a paperweight
funny you should say that turns out
anything with weight can be a paperweight
what are you gonna do with it
well thats up to you isnt it
either you do as i tell
you to and use the door
or im gonna shoot fat tony
right between the eyes
you see this guns
only got two bullets
so im not gonna fuck about
illustrating its significance
youre gonna have to
trust me on that
the alternative
is a little bit absolute
im gonna have
to check your grammar on that
it cant be
just a little bit absolute
it either is or it isnt
whatever it is
ive lost my patience
im telling you i will squeeze this
trigger and tony will be no more
tony
listen to me cunt
you take one step forward
itll be the last fucking
step you ever take
tony get on it
i fucking dare you
just calm down
im leaving
i guess thats
your two bullets eh
rosalind
rosalind
stay fucking still
hello babe
hello love
so youre
basing your whole crescendo
on a figment
of your imagination
im basing my whole crescendo
on the sum of its parts
a few minor details aside
i wouldnt have any trouble at all
selling this juicy peach
of a drama to big dave
hed cream
his fucking panties
youre too smart to be
blackmailing us fletcher
yes yes and obviously ive
taken precautionary measures
you can do all kinds of
horrible things to me if you want
i might even enjoy them
but youd have to leave the
country and never come back
so is that the story over
now fletcher
all this this whole buildup
was leading to this next part
this is the news that
you were asking about before
ready
matthew
hes gonna need some people
to run his business here
when he buys it
from michael right
hes gonna need a reliable pair of
hands someone like you
hmm so why didnt he
ask you raymond
i dont know
its none of my business
because ill tell you
he already had someone
earmarked for the role
dry eye
he promised dry eye the job
but only if dry eye helped drive
down the price of mickeys business
you see it was matthew who told dry
eye the location of mickeys farm
so he could steal
his white widow super cheese
to cause ripples
and reduce the market value
and that is why phuc
in turn
got those juiceswilling
acnebacked muscle marys to do the job
it was matthew
who set this whole
train of events off
but what he did not
plan on you see
fuck you
you old cunt
ill piss on your grave
was dry eye
killing lord george
now dry eye does not want to be
subservient to matthew anymore
doesnt wanna be
subservient to anyone
this is how
its gonna play out
youre gonna
back the fuck off
and im gonna
take it all
dry eye likes the smell of
power and does not like matthew
so the little dragon needed a gentle
reminder of who was really running things
youve been in this paddling
pool for two minutes
ive been swimming in the ocean
with the sharks for 20 years
ill tell you
how this plays out
you will drown
and then my mossad crabs
will eat you
and this my love is why i want
my hardearned 20 million pounds
because not only do i know exactly
how mickeys business operates
but i also know that the very
man hes trying to sell it to
is trying to force him
into selling it on the cheap
and has indirectly
started a war
so you see i think you should be
calling me your trusted consigliere
or your spy
behind the lines
your intellectual
reconnaissance if you prefer
im impressed
you certainly know
more than i do
im impressed not only
by your information
but by your imagination
thank you very much
so youve got 72 hours
and i would just reiterate
that if anything happens to me
i do have my insurance policy
in place

in short order my friend
now i believe
youre a reporter
and theres something
i wanna report to you
now it seems for
this brief moment in time
ive found my way
into the film business
and last night i made a film with
an impressively sized farmyard pig
morning sir
two cups of tea
one with sugar one without
all right lads
go on give us a minute
there are some wet
wipes there over your shoulder
your clothes are neatly folded
there on the bench
now in due course youre gonna
press the space bar on this computer
and youre gonna witness your
participation in said film
now that little drug we
gave you last night really
loosened up
your inhibitions man
the only thing youll need to do to
stop this little creative expression
from becoming
a social media sensation
is lose any interest you have
in the future of mickey pearson
im gonna leave you now
to clean yourself up
space bar yeah
have a hot drink as well
it might make you feel
a little bit better
it was a fucking rough night
for you
enjoy the show
old
macdonald had a farm eieio
and on that farm he had a pig
hows your man then coach
ah hell survive
wouldnt have been the pig i would have chosen though
we know what bit that is
let me tickle that belly
you are so naughty
good lord
i was there and im still shocked
squeal for me piggy
is that who i think it is
yeah it certainly is
and thats your doing
where is that applesauce
you cant unsee it
once youve seen it can you
no you cant unsee it
its nightmare fuel
that will be with me forever
that story
wont be running
right ive got one more
thing i need you to do
ah look
before you continue ray
i train lads to be good lads
im not a fucking gangster
now ive been forced to do some
gangster things thats okay
but im not the gift
that keeps on giving
so with the greatest respect
ill do this one last thing for you
and then thats it
no más
three strikes and im out
everything all right coach
no ernie it isnt
you need to understand the
severity of your actions
dave an hour
okay boss
thank you
for the grand tour
im a believer
thank you chaps
now are we ready
to finalize the numbers
we already have
mm
the situations changed
michael
the markets changed
how so
the exit value of your business
needs to be recalculated
please be specific
oh i will be
youre asking 400 for 12 locations
and a distribution network
which was a fair valuation
at the time
but when one of those
locations was compromised
the value of all those
locations were compromised
and this obviously
affects the price
your skunk farm was a fucking viral
sensation on youtube michael
and when johnny law starts
sniffing which he will
all of those locations
will have to cease production
for id say at least 12 months
at a cost of 100 million net pa
before marking down the loss of
staff relocation and site rentals
you still with me
yes im following
it will take
at least three years
to get your supply distribution
and demand back to full capacity
your staffing costs are 25 of
your 100 million operational cost
so thats 25 million per annum
for three annums
and location rental
at 15 million a year
thats a 120 gbp bite
right there
your unit economics
have taken a hit
and forecasting out your topline growth
margin in the current inimical climate
i calculate what was worth
400 million a month ago
must now be valued
at an anemic mm 130
you see its not about the
first domino that fell michael
its about the last
please
i like you michael
youre a good chap
and if you want me to help you out of
this hole youve found yourself in
i can pay you
100 million dollars today
its a good offer
and its real
and ill do this
because im your friend
my accountant can transfer
the fee within the hour
i like your domino analogy
the question i ask is
who tumbled the first domino
im afraid thats not my
concern or my business michael
at the risk
of contradicting you
it is very much your business
and certainly your concern
only you made one mistake
that being
you seem to have mistaken me
for some kind of a cunt
let me introduce you
to the first domino
its a tad dramatic isnt it
corpses in freezers who is this man
whats he got to do with
anything that im talking about
i take it with that statement
you are in denial
of sosaid relationship
with this frozen chinaman
well of course
im in denial of it
i dont have relationships
with dead frozen chinamen
best not to be glib at this time
in the proceedings matthew
dont bother looking
for your mossad crabs
this is a fish market
they have found a home
to be clear
i do not know that man
ill tell you
how this plays out
you will drown and then
my mossad crabs will eat you
so while you were discussing
who would take over my business
after you fucked it
you somehow mistook sosaid
chinaman for someone else
business is business michael
its nothing personal
while i am not emotional
about the money
there is a price indebted to me for
the blood ive gotten on my hands
restoring order to the
untidiness that you created
and that price
according to you
400 minus 130
is 270 million dollars
and im keeping
the business
while you are
getting in the freezer
and you will make that transaction if
you want to get out of the freezer
it is 25 below zero in there
so i assume youll last about an hour
that said
i wouldnt fuck about
because frostbite is very
expensive on the fingers and toes
so i would type as quickly as possible
while you have the use of them
uh
after youve attended to that indiscretion
you can then deal with the next
consequence of your shortsightedness
as stated
i am not emotional about the money
but i am emotional about the fact that
someone laid their hands on my wife
my wife
no amount of money on gods green earth
can pay for that transgression matthew
no for that
i want a pound of flesh
a pound of flesh
it matters not to me
where on your anatomy
it is withdrawn from
if you dont have the stomach
to take it for yourself
big bunny here
is very adept with a knife
and as you can see
hes dressed for the weather
but a penny short
or a gram shy
and that freezer door
does not open
am i clear
good
bunny
incoming
what is it wagyu again
for breakfast raymond
arent you gonna introduce me to your
mysterious and slightly menacing friend
whats that for
is that for my money
wheres my money raymond
theres your payment
go on take a look
thank you
mysterious stranger
well thats disappointing cause that
doesnt look like 20 million pounds
its more interesting than that
your insurance policy
all the photos all the bodies
all the skeletons all the filth
its not the only one
darling im not a mong
what do you thinks in that
you fucking eejit
of course we were
aware of what matthew was up to
were not complete
fucking idiots
ive been onto you
for a long time fletcher
i knew youd been following michael
theyre very similar
our jobs
only im better at it
than you are
i knew when you came over that night that
youd only be there for half an hour
buenas tardes raymondo
to tell me how clever you
are and try to blackmail us
ive got some very important
information to impart to you raymond
i also knew you couldnt
resist a 1500 single malt
an 80 wagyu steak and a
stateoftheart smokeless barbie
that even keeps your feet warm
i love a barbie
i promise you you will regret
this if you dont hear it
and when the scotch
got into your cold veins
you lost the benefit
of your sharp instincts
oh goody another bottle
can you tell the mysterious
gentleman to relax
because i promise you you will regret it
if you dont hear this sit down my love
see i kept you there cause i needed
to know about matthew and dry eye
took us a while to find
your insurance policies
cause youre
a naughty squirrel fletcher
fletcher shoes off inside
yes mommy
but it was made a lot easier after
i planted a tracker in your shoe
youre never gonna be
a predator with us fletcher
youre always
gonna be prey
so thats it three strikes
were good right
ill see you around
with the greatest respect i hope not
now fletcher
what were you saying
it wasnt
lord george that was after mickey
or dry eye or matthew
do you wanna know who it was
ive got photos
right
youve got 30 seconds
thank you darling
fuck
primetime
what is it son
coach were gonna take
care of this for you
ernies got a plan
what the fuck
are you talking about
the michael situation
were gonna sort it
primetime listen prime
jesus
now you
remember aslan dont you
the young gentleman
you kept in the freezer
well this is aslan senior
russian oligarch
exkgb made all
his money in gas pipes
and hes extremely sad that his
oneandonly son fell out of a window
oh shit
and i fear that where
they failed before raymond
theyre not gonna fail again
and how do you know
all this
because someone told them everything
they want to know about michael
and that someone is me
go on
so i said id tell them
where michael was for a price
but that money was pending till
after you know the deed was done
and then when they
messed up the first time
i had a little rethink and came
up with my version 20 plan
which is
when i came to see you
you see get my 20 mils
off michael first
and then after the event
get paid again double bubble
but you and your mysterious friend
put paid to that so well done you
why did you just
look at your watch
well its like i say
the russians are gonna clean house
and you are part of
that house raymond
theyre gonna get michael when he comes
out of his meeting at the fish market
and they are coming here
so you see what ive done there
by telling you
ive saved your lives
which i think in turn
saves mine doesnt it
dont fucking move
dave
dave
no dave
fuck
fuck

so the toddlers
spray the car with bullets
killing the russians
the car rolls to a stop
smash cut to black titles
