i just thought it would be nice to have
a bottle handy in case we had guests

john nice to meet you

i never get tired of watching
these kids enjoy the party
it really is im so sorry
we didnt do this sooner
dont be its a big leap
adopting an older child
is not an easy decision to make
johns in the bathroom
think hell find us
do you wanna go look for him
where did you get the idea for this one
my paintings always tell stories
this ones about a sad mother lion
who cant find her cubs
shes smiling
shes dreaming about her babies
its the only thing
that makes her happy
i hope she finds them
she will look
they were lost in the jungle
and they were so scared
because they didnt have a mother
just when they thought
theyd be alone forever
they found their mother asleep
under this tree
now when she wakes up
her dream will have come true
shell have her family again
amazing you came up with that story

i guess
its really boring here
its boring here
if youre so bored
why arent you down at the party
ive never really seen the point of it
nobodys ever talked to me before
i guess im different
theres nothing wrong
with being different
well you two have a lot in common
i think people should always
try to take the bad things
that happen to them
and turn them into something good
dont you
yeah
absolutely
shes originally from russia but
its amazing how strong her english is
shes only been in the country
a few years
you get children from other countries
its rare but when we do
its sometimes difficult to place them
the family that brought her to america
died in a house fire
in a fire
my god
esther barely got out
shes been through a lot
but this is an extraordinary little girl
shes very bright
shes very mature for her age
and shes very wellmannered
shes a bit of a princess actually
she wears those ribbons on her wrists
and her neck all the time
mine too
we had trouble with her
when we tried to take them off
how does she get along
with other kids
oh when she has to interact
shes great
babe

we have to talk about last night
do we

see there are certain things
that grownups do
that children arent supposed to see
and that was one of them
esther listen to me
when grownups love each other
very very much
they wanna show each other
that love express it
i know they fuck
she couldve picked it up anywhere
probably at school
this wasnt something she overheard
i mean she knew what it meant
huh
and babe
the way she said it is
i dont even think she expected
to get in trouble over it
well well talk to her about it tonight
fine
well what did you have in mind
no i thought we could take her
to dr browning
i dont think we need to take her
to the shrink quite yet
well you know
we just dont know that much about her
the family she stayed with
couldve been like
pass the fucking potatoes
at dinnertime you know
if shes saying it to my face what
is she saying when were not there
i dont want her exerting
that kind of influence over max
anyway i just dont want to make
a big deal out of one little dirty word
fine fucking spend some time
with her then
all right bitch
lets have a snow fight
come on no throwing snowballs
hey neighbor
hey
havent seen you around lately
ive been pretty busy
has the homeowners association
been soldiering on without me
its not the same
um actually i had a favor to ask
i have a chair
that i need moved upstairs
and i was hoping you could come by
and help me with that sometime
yeah
yeah sure
good
maybe kate and i could help you out
just let us know
ill call you
lets go honey
okay im watching you
brendas father says
that you pushed her
thats not true
we were just playing
i swear
okay
and did you see what happened
what mom whats she saying
she wants you to pass the bread
and butter
wasnt asking you
hey now
can you eat normal
i am eating normal
yeah maybe in transylvania
or whatever country youre from
incidentally im from russia
transylvania isnt even a country
its a part of romania
you are such a freak
hey
hey danny
i dont want any more talk like that
but why does she have to act
like that
all my friends make fun of me
because of her
maybe you need different friends
maybe you should send her back
to the retard camp
daniel
daniel
apologize to your sister
shes not my fucking sister
i got it
okay
thats me
you get the key back
when you say youre sorry
is there anything special
you want me to make tonight
you have any favorites
hello
well how are you
hi were great were doing good
how is she
shes here hold on
hey sister abigail
do you wanna say hello
come on esther just quickly say hi
i said no
you know what do you mind darling
can you get five apples for me
sorry she got shy all of a sudden
its all right
im just calling to remind you
that im gonna need her medical
and dental charts
for my supervision report
shes not thrilled about the dentist
how is everyone doing
is she opening up to you
i guess you can say that she dropped
the fbomb on me a few weeks ago
i guess shes finally
coming out of her shell
yeah
any other glitches i should know of
we had a big one recently
its a girl named brenda at school
they were at the playground
there was a slide well she fell off
esther may have pushed her down
im not getting the story straight
but she got hurt
is she all right
luckily she broke her ankle
and had something like six stitches
that doesnt sound too lucky
well shes lucky
she didnt break her neck
you told me
you didnt know how to play
no i didnt
yes you did
you offered to teach me
and i accepted
okay so then you were
just pretending this whole time
i thought
you would enjoy teaching me
it must be frustrating for someone
who loves music as much as you
to have a son who isnt interested
and a daughter who cant even hear
wait wait wait
i walk in on her playing tchaikovsky
without a mistake
i mean shes been lying to me
this whole time
she just wants to spend time
with you its hardly a lie
you wouldnt know
you wouldnt
shes on her best behavior with you
shes completely different with me
so what are you saying
i dont know
she threw a fit at school
she pushed brenda at the playground
now youre saying that was her fault
i dont know honey i dont know
i wasnt there
you were watching them
oh come on it was an accident
okay lets not blame her
for anything fine
ill take her word for everything
should i just believe what she said
about you and joyce too
what did she say
she says that you were hitting on her
what
oh come on she mustve
misunderstood it was like
did she invite you over
she asked me
to help her move a chair
she did
yeah i blew her off
oh god
why didnt you tell me
i
we couldve laughed about it
no i knew how
you were hiding it
honey i knew how youd react
kate kate
you cant get jealous of every woman
that i talk to right
its been like 10 years
what does that mean
you say that
like it actually means something
its only been two years
since you told me
you know how sorry i am i just feel
like ive earned a little trust here
i gave you a second chance
thats not fair thats not fair
let me get this straight we can talk
about my mistakes not yours
i was sick you were an asshole
who wanted to fuck somebody else
you put our childs life in danger
i couldve walked away months ago
nobody wouldve blamed me
oh thats sharp thats sharp where
did you get that from your mother
danny turn that crap down please
i gotta work
fine
thank you
ill get it
hello esther
what are you doing here
may i come in
im afraid i may have made a mistake
there could be something wrong
with esther
what
what you told us that youd never
had any trouble with her
i didnt but trouble does have a way
of finding her
what kind of trouble
two girls get into a fight there she is
someone gets caught stealing
there she is again
so does that mean
just let her finish
after you told me about the girl in
the playground i called her old school
while she was there
there was a boy
who fell with scissors in his hand
and accidentally stabbed himself
through the jaw
and esther was there again
i dont understand
he accidentally stabbed himself
but the most troubling thing
is the sullivan house fire
i checked into it further it was arson
they have never found the person
who did it
what are you suggesting here
that she had anything to do
with any of this
its ridiculous
that a child could commit such crimes
it flies in the face
of everything i believe
well yeah
theres a mean lady here
shes come to take me away
will you help me
weve had
some behavioral problems but
yeah nothing like that i mean right
yes we have
really hon think about it
ive tried to reach the russian
orphanage where she was raised
i think we need to know
what were dealing with
well ill tell you
what were dealing with
no you know what
stop it listen
were dealing with a 9yearold girl
whos an orphan okay
were taking her to dr browning
we can take her to dr browning
do you want to play
ill call you
as soon as i find anything else out
right take care
okay thank you very much
maybe later
its going to be fine
well scare her so bad
shell never come back here
here she comes
wave your arms and make her stop
max go
you all right max
max
you okay
stop crying
grab a foot
and help me get her off the road
now
help me hide her
that doesnt matter
theyll send you to jail
just for helping me hide her
i had to kill her
because she was going to tell on me
youre not going to tell on me
are you
dont worry
youre my little sister
i wont let anything happen to you
i love you
tell me what you saw
what are you doing
what did you see
i saw you and max in the tree house
what else
what do you mean
what else did you see
i didnt see anything i swear
did you tell anyone
no
i didnt tell anyone
please
if i find out that youre lying
ill cut your hairless little prick off
before you even figure out
what its for
do you understand me
yes
you pissed yourself
it was nice talking to you alice
i hope we can be friends
id like that
well be right out honey
you can come on in
my initial instinct is that
theres not a deeplyrooted problem
in esthers past
so theres nothing wrong with her
no
its not all good news
i think what needs to be examined
is esthers relationship
with those around her
specifically with you kate
it seems she feels theres been some
real tension between the two of you
okay
shes doing her best to please you
but youre blocking her attempts
to bond
thats not true thats not true at all
ive done everything
right
just let her finish
somethings happening
to cause esther to feel this way
perhaps its your guilt about drinking
or what happened to max
maybe some of your feelings
of inadequacy as a mother
are manifesting themselves
in your relationship with esther
i dont feel inadequate
what did she tell you
she didnt see she doesnt know
shes so stupid
esthers a very shy reserved
sensitive little girl going through
an extremely difficult time
shes exceptionally bright
and highly articulate
she just needs a little patience
and understanding
thanks for your support back there
that was your idea
kate wait wait wait
im not a psychiatrist
but a lot of what she said made sense
do you wanna get that
hello
hello is this mrs coleman
yes whos this
this is sister judith
from st marianas
im sorry to bother you
but i need to know
if sister abigail
made it to her appointment with you
yes why
she hasnt returned since yesterday
and im just starting
to get really worried
charlie 24
you wanna hold them there
hey
okay i think were done
detective do you have any leads
or suspects
no not yet
i just dont understand
this kind of thing
who would do this its
awful
you think of anything else
you give us a call
yes absolutely
lets go
this is what sister abigail
was talking about look
characterdisturbed children
look at the symptoms
superficially charming difficulty
at making and keeping friends
im not sure this is what she meant
she couldve told dr browning
whatever she wanted to hear look
they are adroit manipulators
oftentimes playing people off
one another to get what they want
well you gonna show this
to dr browning
im not showing her anything
im not seeing her anymore
when did you decide that
when do you think
youre gonna discount dr browning
why does everyone get the benefit
of the doubt from you except for me
if you need help with the kids
we can arrange that
i dont need help
i just wanna know more about her
i wanna know where she came from
and i wanna know who she is
what if sister abigail was right
i mean if someone was in danger
our own children
wouldnt you wanna know
of course i would
ill contact the orphanage she came from
in russia all right
i mean its a start
what
hey
fine
i was wondering if youd heard from
anyone at the sludyanka shelter
sister abigail had mentioned
that she would
oh you did
i dont understand how can they have
no record of her being there
yes please
could you just call me as soon as
you know anything please thank you
esther we gotta go
esther
esther
you got me
what
i dont want to go to the dentist
why not
i just dont want to go
what are you scared
no
were gonna reschedule though
tell you what ill let you play hooky
if you want to come and draw with me
all right
wait daniel
how are you two getting along
with esther
fine i guess
yeah
yeah mom
but has she ever made you feel
i dont know uncomfortable
or has she done anything
that shes not supposed to do
no
like has she ever hurt any of you
no
you sure
okay all right
i like it when its just the two of us
you dont know how long ive waited
for a daddy just like you
mommy too right
i dont think
mommy likes me very much
hey
that is not true mommy loves you
its all right
it must be hard to love an adopted child
as much as your own
sweetheart youre just as much a part
of this family as danny and max okay
do something nice for mommy
show her how much you love her
thats a wonderful idea
i have a special surprise
for you mommy

i picked these flowers just for you
esther what did you do god

why did you do this
daddy my arm
john
hey
what did you do
hey stop stop

in almost a year
we wanna help you
but theres nothing we can do
until you stop lying to yourself
im not lying i wanted to drink it
you have no fucking idea how badly
i wanted to drink it but i didnt
i didnt drink it
if max had gotten hurt
what happened this morning
has nothing to do with this
i find that hard to believe
the only reason that im sober
is because of max and daniel
i think about what would have happened
had you not been there
and it makes me wanna kill myself
i would never do anything
to let something like that
ever happen again i wouldnt
that is so manipulative
i know i havent given you reason
to believe me i know i havent
i lied to you
i should have told you about this
ill go to therapy ill go to fucking aa
if thats what you want
but you have to believe me
i dont
you have to believe me
john you have to trust me on this

moms gonna come in the afternoon
all right im willing to do this
im willing to try and figure this out
but its up to you
ill shoot mommy if you tell
max max are you okay

whats wrong with you
kate its too late its your own fault
you took your family for granted
what do you mean

the picture i sent you
is of our adopted daughter
and shes 9 years old
no shes not
she has a rare hormone disorder
its called hypopituitarism
it causes proportional dwarfism
she only looks like a child
according to our records
leena klammer was born in 1976
shes 33 years old
this cant be this is a mistake
i hope so for your sake
does she have the scars
what i dont know what scars
leena was one
of our most violent patients
when she was here
she was kept in a straitjacket
to stop her from hurting our staff
she was constantly fighting
to get out
it cut into her skin and left her
with scars around her wrists and neck
there is no way
you could not have seen them
why was she at your hospital
shes dangerously ill violent
she killed seven people that we know of
oh my god how could she fool us
she has been passing herself off
as a little girl for most of her life
she tricked a family here in estonia
into adopting her
when she couldnt seduce the father
she killed him and his whole family
then she burned the house down
yes how did you know
she disappeared a year ago
and we lost track of her
if its really leena
you dont have much time
