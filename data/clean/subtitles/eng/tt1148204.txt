congratulations  mrs  coleman 
it s a girl 
yes  kate  your dreams can be
a manifestation of your emotions 
it s your body and mind s way
of dealing   
   with the stress and grief
of what happened 
what if this has nothing to do
with the stillbirth 
what do you think it s about 
we re seeing kids
for the first time this weekend 
and maybe the nightmares   
maybe i m just not ready to adopt yet 
i drove by the wine shop
on the way home the other night 
did you stop 
no  wanted to  the thought
went through my brain  you know 
it wasn t for myself  it wasn t   
i just thought it would be nice to have
a bottle handy  in case we had guests 
but you didn t go in 
mm mm 
the key  to me   
   is not that you had the urge   
   but that you resisted it 
you wouldn t have made it through
the home study if you weren t ready 
but  ultimately   
   you have to decide 
hi 
honey  hello

it s a beautiful butterfly

  they re remarkable 
thank you 
my name is esther  what s yours 
john  nice to meet you 
  can i take a seat 
  of course 
i never get tired of watching
these kids enjoy the party 
it really is  i m so sorry
we didn t do this sooner 
don t be  it s a big leap 
adopting an older child
is not an easy decision to make 
john s in the bathroom 
think he ll find us 
do you wanna go look for him 
  where did you get the idea for this one 
  my paintings always tell stories 
this one s about a sad mother lion
who can t find her cubs 
  she s smiling 
  she s dreaming about her babies 
it s the only thing
that makes her happy 
  i hope she finds them 
  she will  look 
they were lost in the jungle 
and they were so scared   
   because they didn t have a mother 
just when they thought
they d be alone forever   
   they found their mother asleep
under this tree 
now when she wakes up 
her dream will have come true 
  she ll have her family again 
  amazing  you came up with that story 
  i think i hear his voice down here 
  yes 
hey  i want to introduce you 
this is my wife  kate 
kate  this is esther 
hello 
how are you  nice to meet you 
she painted all these 
  really 
  yeah 
these are fantastic 
these are really wonderful 
  thank you 
  where did you learn how to do this 
i ve just had lots of time to practice 
i guess 
it s really boring here 
it s boring here 
if you re so bored 
why aren t you down at the party 
i ve never really seen the point of it 
nobody s ever talked to me before 
i guess i m different 
there s nothing wrong
with being different 
well  you two have a lot in common 
i think people should always   
   try to take the bad things
that happen to them   
   and turn them into something good 
  don t you 
  yeah 
absolutely 
she s originally from russia  but
it s amazing how strong her english is 
she s only been in the country
a few years 
you get children from other countries 
it s rare  but when we do 
it s sometimes difficult to place them 
the family that brought her to america
died in a house fire 
in a fire 
my god 
esther barely got out 
she s been through a lot 
but this is an extraordinary little girl 
she s very bright 
she s very mature for her age 
and she s very well mannered 
she s a bit of a princess  actually 
she wears those ribbons on her wrists
and her neck all the time 
mine too 
we had trouble with her
when we tried to take them off 
how does she get along
with other kids 
oh  when she has to interact 
she s great 
babe 
  she really did seem to open up with us 
  yeah 
i thought she more
than opened up with you 
you seem to have made
quite a connection 
i could get the paperwork together
and see you back here in three weeks

esther 
we have to talk about last night 
  do we 
  yes  we do 
see  there are certain things
that grown ups do   
   that children aren t supposed to see 
and that was one of them 
esther  listen to me 
when grown ups love each other
very  very much   
   they wanna show each other
that love  express it 
i know  they fuck 
she could ve picked it up anywhere 
probably at school 
this wasn t something she overheard 
i mean  she knew what it meant 
huh 
and  babe 
the way she said it is   
i don t even think she expected
to get in trouble over it 
well  we ll talk to her about it tonight 
fine 
well  what did you have in mind 
no  i thought we could take her
to dr  browning 
i don t think we need to take her
to the shrink quite yet 
well  you know 
we just don t know that much about her 
the family she stayed with
could ve been like 
 pass the fucking potatoes 
at dinnertime  you know 
if she s saying it to my face  what
is she saying when we re not there 
i don t want her exerting
that kind of influence over max 
anyway  i just don t want to make
a big deal out of one little dirty word 
fine  fucking spend some time
with her  then 
all right  bitch 
let s have a snow fight 
come on  no throwing snowballs 
hey  neighbor 
  hey 
  haven t seen you around lately 
i ve been pretty busy 
has the homeowners  association
been soldiering on without me 
it s not the same 
um  actually  i had a favor to ask 
i have a chair
that i need moved upstairs   
   and i was hoping you could come by
and help me with that sometime 
yeah 
  yeah  sure 
  good 
maybe kate and i could help you out 
just let us know 
i ll call you 
let s go  honey 
okay  i m watching you 
brenda s father says
that you pushed her 
that s not true 
we were just playing 
i swear 
  okay 
  and did you see what happened 
what  mom  what s she saying 
she wants you to pass the bread
and butter 
  wasn t asking you 
  hey  now 
can you eat normal 
i am eating normal 
yeah  maybe in transylvania 
or whatever country you re from 
incidentally  i m from russia 
transylvania isn t even a country 
it s a part of romania 
you are such a freak 
  hey 
  hey  danny 
i don t want any more talk like that 
but why does she have to act
like that 
all my friends make fun of me
because of her 
maybe you need different friends 
maybe you should send her back
to the retard camp 
  daniel 
  daniel 
apologize to your sister 
she s not my fucking sister 
i got it 
okay 
that s me 
you get the key back
when you say you re sorry 
is there anything special
you want me to make tonight 
you have any favorites 
hello 
  well  how are you 
  hi  we re great  we re doing good 
  how is she 
  she s here  hold on 
hey  sister abigail 
do you wanna say hello 
  come on  esther  just quickly say hi 
  i said  no 
you know what  do you mind  darling 
can you get five apples for me 
sorry  she got shy all of a sudden 
it s all right 
i m just calling to remind you   
   that i m gonna need her medical   
   and dental charts
for my supervision report 
she s not thrilled about the dentist 
how is everyone doing 
is she opening up to you 
i guess you can say that  she dropped
the f bomb on me a few weeks ago 
i guess she s finally
coming out of her shell 
yeah 
any other glitches i should know of 
we had a big one recently 
it s a girl named brenda at school 
they were at the playground 
there was a slide  well  she fell off 
esther may have pushed her down 
i m not getting the story straight 
but she got hurt 
is she all right 
luckily  she broke her ankle
and had something like six stitches 
that doesn t sound too lucky 
well  she s lucky
she didn t break her neck 
you told me
you didn t know how to play 
  no  i didn t 
  yes  you did 
you offered to teach me
and i accepted 
okay  so then you were
just pretending this whole time 
i thought
you would enjoy teaching me 
it must be frustrating for someone
who loves music as much as you   
   to have a son who isn t interested
and a daughter who can t even hear 
wait  wait  wait 
i walk in on her playing tchaikovsky
without a mistake 
i mean  she s been lying to me
this whole time 
she just wants to spend time
with you  it s hardly a lie 
you wouldn t know 
you wouldn t 
she s on her best behavior with you 
she s completely different with me 
so  what are you saying 
i don t know 
she threw a fit at school 
she pushed brenda at the playground 
  now you re saying that was her fault 
  i don t know  honey  i don t know 
i wasn t there 
you were watching them 
oh  come on  it was an accident 
okay  let s not blame her
for anything  fine 
i ll take her word for everything 
should i just believe what she said
about you and joyce too 
what did she say 
  she says that you were hitting on her 
  what 
oh  come on  she must ve
misunderstood  it was  like   
did she invite you over 
she asked me
to help her move a chair 
  she did 
  yeah  i blew her off 
oh  god 
why didn t you tell me 
  i   
  we could ve laughed about it 
  no  i knew how   
  you were hiding it 
honey  i knew how you d react 
kate  kate 
you can t get jealous of every woman
that i talk to  right 
  it s been like 10 years 
  what does that mean 
you say that
like it actually means something 
it s only been two years
since you told me 
you know how sorry i am  i just feel
like i ve earned a little trust here 
  i gave you a second chance 
  that s not fair  that s not fair 
let me get this straight  we can talk
about my mistakes  not yours 
i was sick  you were an asshole
who wanted to fuck somebody else 
you put our child s life in danger 
i could ve walked away months ago 
nobody would ve blamed me 
oh  that s sharp  that s sharp  where
did you get that from  your mother 
danny  turn that crap down  please 
i gotta work 
  fine 
  thank you 
i ll get it 
  hello  esther 
  what are you doing here 
may i come in 
i m afraid i may have made a mistake 
there could be something wrong
with esther 
what 
what  you told us that you d never
had any trouble with her 
i didn t  but trouble does have a way
of finding her 
what kind of trouble 
two girls get into a fight  there she is 
someone gets caught stealing 
there she is again 
  so  does that mean    
  just let her finish 
after you told me about the girl in
the playground  i called her old school 
while she was there 
there was a boy   
   who fell with scissors in his hand   
   and accidentally stabbed himself
through the jaw 
and esther was there again 
i don t understand 
he accidentally stabbed himself 
but the most troubling thing
is the sullivan house fire 
i checked into it further  it was arson 
they have never found the person
who did it 
what are you suggesting here 
that she had anything to do
with any of this 
it s ridiculous 
that a child could commit such crimes   
   it flies in the face
of everything i believe 
well  yeah 
there s a mean lady here 
she s come to take me away 
will you help me 
we ve had
some behavioral problems  but   
yeah  nothing like that  i mean  right 
  yes  we have 
  really  hon  think about it 
i ve tried to reach the russian
orphanage where she was raised 
i think we need to know
what we re dealing with 
well  i ll tell you
what we re dealing with 
  no  you know what 
  stop it  listen 
we re dealing with a 9 year old girl
who s an orphan  okay 
  we re taking her to dr  browning 
  we can take her to dr  browning 
do you want to play 
i ll call you
as soon as i find anything else out 
  right  take care 
  okay  thank you very much 
maybe later 
it s going to be fine 
we ll scare her so bad
she ll never come back here 
here she comes 
wave your arms and make her stop 
max  go 
you all right  max 
max 
you okay 
stop crying 
grab a foot
and help me get her off the road 
now 
help me hide her 
that doesn t matter 
they ll send you to jail
just for helping me hide her 
i had to kill her
because she was going to tell on me 
you re not going to tell on me 
are you 
don t worry 
you re my little sister 
i won t let anything happen to you 
i love you 
tell me what you saw 
  what are you doing 
  what did you see 
i saw you and max in the tree house 
what else 
  what do you mean 
  what else did you see 
i didn t see anything  i swear 
  did you tell anyone 
  no 
i didn t tell anyone 
please   
if i find out that you re lying 
i ll cut your hairless little prick off   
   before you even figure out
what it s for 
  do you understand me 
  yes 
you pissed yourself 
it was nice talking to you  alice 
i hope we can be friends 
i d like that 
  we ll be right out  honey 
  you can come on in 
my initial instinct is that   
   there s not a deeply rooted problem
in esther s past 
  so there s nothing wrong with her 
  no 
it s not all good news 
i think what needs to be examined   
   is esther s relationship
with those around her 
specifically with you  kate 
it seems she feels there s been some
real tension between the two of you 
  okay 
  she s doing her best to please you   
   but you re blocking her attempts
to bond 
that s not true  that s not true at all 
i ve done everything 
  right 
  just let her finish 
something s happening
to cause esther to feel this way 
perhaps it s your guilt about drinking
or what happened to max 
maybe some of your feelings
of inadequacy as a mother   
   are manifesting themselves
in your relationship with esther 
i don t feel inadequate 
what did she tell you 
she didn t see  she doesn t know 
she s so stupid 
esther s a very shy  reserved   
   sensitive little girl going through
an extremely difficult time 
she s exceptionally bright
and highly articulate 
she just needs a little patience
and understanding 
thanks for your support back there 
that was your idea 
kate  wait  wait  wait 
i m not a psychiatrist 
but a lot of what she said made sense 
do you wanna get that 
  hello 
  hello  is this mrs  coleman 
yes  who s this 
this is sister judith
from st  mariana s 
i m sorry to bother you 
but i need to know   
   if sister abigail
made it to her appointment with you 
yes  why 
she hasn t returned since yesterday   
    and i m just starting
to get really worried 
charlie 24 
you wanna hold them there 
hey 
okay  i think we re done 
detective  do you have any leads
or suspects 
  no  not yet 
  i just don t understand   
   this kind of thing 
who would do this  it s   
awful 
you think of anything else 
you give us a call 
yes  absolutely 
let s go 
this is what sister abigail
was talking about  look 
 character disturbed children  
look at the symptoms 
 superficially charming  difficulty
at making and keeping friends  
i m not sure this is what she meant 
she could ve told dr  browning
whatever she wanted to hear  look 
they  are adroit manipulators   
   oftentimes playing people off
one another to get what they want  
well  you gonna show this
to dr  browning 
i m not showing her anything 
i m not seeing her anymore 
  when did you decide that 
  when do you think 
you re gonna discount dr  browning 
why does everyone get the benefit
of the doubt from you except for me 
if you need help with the kids 
we can arrange that 
i don t need help 
i just wanna know more about her 
i wanna know where she came from 
and i wanna know who she is 
what if sister abigail was right

for a daddy just like you 
mommy too  right 
i don t think
mommy likes me very much 
hey

  it s all right 
it must be hard to love an adopted child
as much as your own 
sweetheart  you re just as much a part
of this family as danny and max  okay 
do something nice for mommy 
show her how much you love her 
that s a wonderful idea

it also wouldn t be the first time
you blamed esther for your own mistake 
you know what 
i want her out of this house

i bought two bottles 
i poured one of them down the sink 
  but not this one

john  i haven t had a drink
in almost a year 
we wanna help you 
but there s nothing we can do   
   until you stop lying to yourself 
  i m not lying  i wanted to drink it 
you have no fucking idea how badly
i wanted to drink it  but i didn t 
  i didn t drink it 
  if max had gotten hurt   
what happened this morning
has nothing to do with this 
i find that hard to believe 
the only reason that i m sober
is because of max and daniel 
i think about what would have happened
had you not been there   
   and it makes me wanna kill myself 
i would never do anything   
   to let something like that
ever happen again  i wouldn t 
that is so manipulative 
i know i haven t given you reason
to believe me  i know i haven t 
i lied to you 
i should have told you about this 
i ll go to therapy  i ll go to fucking a a 
if that s what you want   
   but you have to believe me

esther 
  hello 
  is this katherine coleman 
  hello 
  yeah  this is she 
my name is dr  värava 
i m calling from the saarne institute 
  i ve just seen the picture you e mailed 
  and do you recognize her 
where is she right now  is she
someplace where she can hear you 
no  she s not with me 
she s with my husband at home 
call your husband right now  and tell him
to get your family out of the house 
  and then call the police 
  he won t listen to me  but why 
then tell him the little girl in the picture
is not really a little girl 
  she s a grown woman 
  what 
what are you talking about 
the picture i sent you   
    is of our adopted daughter 
and she s 9 years old 
no  she s not 
she has a rare hormone disorder 
it s called hypopituitarism 
it causes proportional dwarfism 
she only looks like a child 
according to our records 
leena klammer was born in 1976 
she s 33 years old 
this can t be  this is a mistake 
i hope so  for your sake 
does she have the scars 
what  i don t know  what scars 
leena was one
of our most violent patients 
when she was here 
she was kept in a straitjacket   
    to stop her from hurting our staff 
she was constantly fighting
to get out 
it cut into her skin and left her
with scars around her wrists and neck 
there is no way
you could not have seen them 
why was she at your hospital 
she s dangerously ill  violent 
she killed seven people that we know of 
oh  my god  how could she fool us 
she has been passing herself off
as a little girl for most of her life 
she tricked a family here in estonia
into adopting her 
when she couldn t seduce the father 
she killed him and his whole family 
  then she burned the house down 
  yes  how did you know 
she disappeared a year ago
and we lost track of her 
if it s really leena 
you don t have much time 
esther
