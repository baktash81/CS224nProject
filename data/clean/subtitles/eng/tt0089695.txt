  i hope you don t get into any trouble 
  don t worry about me  i can handle 
no retreat 
no surrender 
r j 
later 
who s there 
r j  is that you 
you know  you asked me to come 
i asked you 
sensei lee 
  lee da ge you call me  shall we begin 
  begin 
  begin what 
  your training  you asked me to help 
  i m ready  i ve studied alone 
  and 
  and i haven t been the best of students 
  i know you can do better 
utilize what s up here   
as your way 
that s how you win 
come over here 
this 
it s your beginning 
you must to be like the sword 
we call it martial arts 
the character  wu  is made up of  qua  
which means violence or force 
plus this character ji  meaning stop 
we practice how to stop violence 
what you learn from me
is for defense only and should not be misused 
that s the idea 
it is your move 
you don t want to listen then  bye 
i don t wish revenge 
i only want to learn 
you empty  the cup first 
pardon 
this cup as you 
represents your knowledge 
this cup is what i offer 
the cup of my knowledge   
is more than your cup holds 
no  lee da ge 
then  the cup now is clean 
you understand 
yes 
hao  get in a stance 
punch and power punch 
no 
this hand  no power 
now  hit here 
stand up 
what was the mistake 
punch wasn t fast enough 
easy to defend against 
are you asking or telling me 
now say that to me again 
not fast enough 
easy to defend against 
hao  show me where to improve it 
show you 
listen to the warrior inside 
move and i ll counter 
think of your technique 
a strike 
now my technique is a long move 
see which is first 
again 
hao 
know why you ve been getting hit 
no  lee da ge 
you lead with the shoulder 
and when your shoulder moves  i see it 
you d be quick and direct 
utilizing  chi  
the result is power 
 chi     power 
never can succeed without a surprise 
your training begins tomorrow 
what s wrong 
i m not sure lee da ge 
think of what you are doing 
and if you want to improve yourself 
you must concentrate 
that s your strength 
i just don t feel natural 
now  was that natural enough for you 
sure 
that s because you didn t think about it 
you just reacted 
from now on  be spontaneous 
now  come on 
handling multiple strikes requires timing 
are you ready 
now why are you being hit 
i don t know  but i m standing here   
lee da ge 
all these sand bags are your adversaries 
stay in the center 
how 
ready 
to fight effectively 
you must empty all yourself 
your eyes   
must see  in all directions 
your ears   
shall be aware of all sounds 
and you must learn to feel every movement
before it occurs 
and be ready to react 
try again 
how s that lee da ge 
thanks to you 
is that right lee da ge 
hey  are you crazy 
faster 
c mon jace  man  it s gotta
be faster than that 
c mon  keep moving 
let s go 
faster 
kick me 
what now 
this time i ll kick you 
you weren t ready 
unexpected moves are hard to counter 
so they present worse danger 
pretend my arms trapped this leg 
that s your adversary 
kick 
  hey  get me another beer  hurry it up 
  coming right up 
no  no  no 
bring it over here 
come on 
come on

if you think that it is impossible
