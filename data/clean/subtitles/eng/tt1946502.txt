hello old friend
llou
they know each other
he just said llou
keep up
lou
have you seen my bangs
moxy
i think its an improvement
nervous laughter
hi ready for tomorrow
gasps oh my doll
we we thought
wed give pretty a try
if im being honest
i think you all
kinda look great
just the way you are
well before all of this
look
if youre gonna do this
can i do it for you
at least
first
well pluck a little here
ow
then well tuck
a little there
hey
laughs
then well cut
a little loose
and apply a little mousse
to what seems
to be your hair
then well do a little tweeze
ow
then well do a little more
oh
then well wax
and then well bleach
till youre smoother
than a peach
or at least
a little smoother
than you were before
to me you look okay
coughing
but if you truly
want me to
well sculpt and mold
and change
and fix you anyway
hey
were gettin all dolled up
going with the flow
and looking so appealing
hey cause when
youre all dolled up
no one has to know just
how flawed youre feelin
and if you can hide
whats shining through
theyll see
a whole new you
so well try a little mask
itll open up your pores
whats a pore
then well rub
some lotion in
and well soften up
your skin
so it doesnt look
like yours
then well moisten up
your lips
buff your toenails to a t
and well powder up
your nose
or in your case i suppose
well just put
a little powder
where your nose should be
hey
were getting all dolled up
blendin with the crowd
like we know weve got to
hey cause when
youre all dolled up
thats when youre allowed
to pretend youre not you
and once you conceal
whats real and true
youll see a whole new you
everyone choose your weapons
step one find
the trendiest of outfits
step two pick
the one that just about fits
step three
this is absolutely key
choose it not for you
but for who you wanna be
and then once you know
which look youre into
say when and i guess
we can begin to squeeze
and stretch
and stuff and squish
until we nail
the whole display
song pauses
crickets chirping
song resumes
hey
hey
were getting all dolled up
feelin fresh and free
and lookin ohsojuicy
hey cause when
youre all dolled up
people only see
what you want them to see
and once who you are

no amount of makeup
or fancy new clothes
or dollscaping
excuse you

that deep down
you are uglydolls
theres no changing that
uglydolls can never

moxy
ox wait
you wont believe this

what
come on ox relieve the poor
creatures of their confusion
why dont you start
at the beginning
whats he talking about
moxy all i wanted to do was
protect you but lous right
youre never gonna get
to the big world
let me try to explain
it all began
in the doll factory
i dont know how
but i ended up here at the institute
lou welcomed me
and we became close friends
and after i begged and begged
he even let me train
i even felt like i might
have a shot at the big world
i was messing it up for the others
and they started to turn on me
i was scared
it was only lou who saved me
by showing me a way out
i wandered into the dark
and thats when i discovered
the ugly truth
about who we are
and where we came from
we uglydolls
are nothing but rubbish
the humans found us unlovable
and threw us away
i blocked the way
to recycling
so that outcast dolls
would be diverted to our cove
we are rejects
uglydolls gasp
no
ox we belong in uglyville
where reject dolls
can live safe
and free
of anyone elses judgment
sniffling
oh moxy look at you
this is what ive been trying
to protect you from
but i realized youd need to
hear it from your oldest friend
you dont belong
in the big world
you dont belong anywhere
you shouldnt even exist
moxy
im so sorry i lied
so theres
no big world for us
no kid waiting
im so sorry everyone
this is all my fault
i should never
sobs
moxy wait wait
now ox im an amazingly magnanimous
guy so ill tell you what
go back to uglyville
live your little ugly lives
never come back here
and if you do
its recycling for everyone
i bet theyll be back
that little pink one never gives up
yes well neither do i
extra extra people of
uglyville are revealed to be
rejects
whod have thunk
we heard it straight
from oxs mouth

uglyville may be crushed
