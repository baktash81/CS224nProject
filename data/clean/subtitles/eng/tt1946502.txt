 lucky bat  moxy  thanks for accepting
my random yet urgent invitation 
  how are things 
   moxy  well

6  9  25 
18  36  41

the wisest doll in town 
you re so right 
i have to believe in myself 
uh    sure 
so how do i do that 
specifically 
uh  well 
a wiser doll than me would say
you should stop listening
to what others tell you 
but all i have
to offer you now is some   
satisfaction guaran tea 
oh  you want to read
my tea leaves  of course 
um  you know 
reading tea leaves is not   
it s not really my thing 
but i can tell you that your
forehead looks nice and bright

so take that good luck
and believe in yourself
from the comfort
of your own home 
what do you see 
uh   
  you   
   you  
oh  you mean me 
it s not what you see 
but what i see

moxy 
what are you talking about 
 kitty 
kidnapping should be a crime 
 lydia

 ox 
good points on both sides 
maybe we should stop the
kidnapping until we settle this 
 tuesday 
no way  he s expecting us 
and i want him to see my
bangs  they re side swept now 
 lydia  he s not gonna care
about your bangs 
 tuesday  you guys
are being haters lately 
 ox grunts 
 ox  let me out 
where am i 
who s in charge here 
huh 
hello  old friend 
l lou 
they know each other 
he just said   l lou  
keep up 
lou 
have you seen my bangs 
 moxy 
i think it s an improvement 
 nervous laughter 
hi  ready for tomorrow 
 gasps  oh  my doll 
we    we thought
we d give pretty a try 
if i m being honest 
i think you all
kinda look great
just the way you are 
well  before all of this 
look 
if you re gonna do this 
can i do it for you
at least 
  first
we ll pluck a little here  
ow 
  then we ll tuck
a little there  
  hey 
   laughs 
  then we ll cut
a little loose  
  and apply a little mousse  
  to what seems
to be your hair  
    then we ll do a little tweeze  
  ow 
    then we ll do a little more  
  oh 
  then we ll wax
and then we ll bleach  
  till you re smoother
than a peach  
  or at least
a little smoother  
  than you were before  
  to me  you look okay  
 coughing 
  but if you truly
want me to  
  we ll sculpt and mold  
  and change
and fix you anyway  
  hey
we re gettin  all dolled up  
  going with the flow
and looking so appealing  
  hey   cause when
you re all dolled up  
  no one has to know just
how flawed you re feelin   
  and if you can hide
what s shining through  
  they ll see
a whole new you  
  so we ll try a little mask  
    it ll open up your pores  
  what s a pore 
  then we ll rub
some lotion in  
  and we ll soften up
your skin  
  so it doesn t look
like yours  
  then we ll moisten up
your lips  
  buff your toenails to a t  
  and we ll powder up
your nose  
  or in your case  i suppose  
  we ll just put
a little powder  
  where your nose should be  
  hey
we re getting all dolled up  
  blendin  with the crowd
like we know we ve got to  
  hey   cause when
you re all dolled up  
  that s when you re allowed
to pretend you re not you  
  and once you conceal
what s real and true  
  you ll see a whole new you  
everyone  choose your weapons 
  step one  find
the trendiest of outfits  
  step two  pick
the one that just about fits  
  step three
this is absolutely key  
  choose it not for you
but for who you wanna be  
  and then once you know
which look you re into  
  say when and i guess
we can begin to squeeze  
  and stretch  
  and stuff and squish  
  until we nail
the whole display  
 song pauses 
 crickets chirping 
 song resumes 
  hey 
    hey  
  we re getting all dolled up  
  feelin  fresh and free  
  and lookin  oh so juicy  
  hey   cause when
you re all dolled up  
  people only see
what you want them to see  
  and once who you are
is hidden from view  
  you ll be a whole new you  
check us out 
  you ll be a whole new you  
we are ugly licious 
  you ll be a whole new you  
wow  thank you  mandy

hard work has been for nothing 
what do you mean 
no amount of makeup
or fancy new clothes
or dollscaping   
excuse you 
   can take away the fact
that deep down 
you are uglydolls 
there s no changing that 
uglydolls can never
pass the gauntlet

i suspected as much 
but maybe you ll believe him 
   uglydolls gasp 
   tuesday gasps 
hello  we kidnapped him 
oh  yeah 
ox  i    i don t understand 
  moxy 
  ox  wait

creatures of their confusion 
why don t you start
at the beginning 
what s he talking about 
moxy  all i wanted to do was
protect you  but lou s right 
you re never gonna get
to the big world 
let me try to explain 
it all began
in the doll factory 
i don t know how 
but i ended up here at the institute 
lou welcomed me
and we became close friends 
and after i begged and begged 
he even let me train 
i even felt like i might
have a shot at the big world 
i was messing it up for the others 
and they started to turn on me 
i was scared 
it was only lou who saved me
by showing me a way out 
i wandered into the dark 
and that s when i discovered
the ugly truth
about who we are
and where we came from 
we uglydolls
are nothing but rubbish 
the humans found us unlovable
and threw us away 
i blocked the way
to recycling
so that outcast dolls
would be diverted to our cove 
we are rejects 
   uglydolls gasp 
  no 
 ox  we belong in uglyville
where reject dolls
can live safe
and free
of anyone else s judgment 
 sniffling 
oh  moxy  look at you 
this is what i ve been trying
to protect you from 
but i realized you d need to
hear it from your oldest friend 
you don t belong
in the big world 
you don t belong anywhere 
you shouldn t even exist 
moxy 
i m so sorry i lied 
so there s
no big world for us 
no kid waiting 
i m so sorry  everyone 
this is all my fault 
i should never   
 sobs 
moxy  wait  wait 
now  ox  i m an amazingly magnanimous
guy  so i ll tell you what 
go back to uglyville 
live your little ugly lives 
never come back here 
and if you do 
it s recycling for everyone 
i bet they ll be back 
that little pink one never gives up 
yes  well  neither do i 
extra  extra  people of
uglyville are revealed to be   
 rejects  
who d have thunk

the courage to come here

uglyville may be crushed 
but we both know
moxy will never give up 
without you around 
the rest of them will stay away forever 
the only reason i let you
stay in perfection
was to keep up appearances

do you know how long i ve
worked for that adulation 
those pretty dolls 
they re mine 
they hang on my every word

it all started
with the tea leaves 
my tea leaves

to talk to her out of it 
i thought it was
a great idea all along 
 scoffs  don t drag me
into your little pity party 
  hmph
