i have no words i can rely on
because my tongue was designed
long and flat
and is therefore
an ineffective tool
for making complicated
polysyllabic sounds
and that is why im here now
waiting for denny
to come home
lying in a puddle
of my own making
keys jingling
door unlocks
denny yo enz
door closes
footsteps approaching
enzo
enzo i hear the worry
in his voice
denny what happened pal
oh enz
enzo
i can smell the day on him
motor oil and gasoline
and roast chicken
denny can you get up bud
im here buddy
denny im right here
okay
enzo if only i could speak
i would tell him not to worry
i saw a documentary
about mongolia on tv once
in mongolia
they believe that when a dog
has finished living
his lifetimes as a dog
his next incarnation
will be as a man
im right here bud
there he is
enzo i realize this would mean
losing all my memories
my experiences
but i have a plan
i will try to imprint
what i know on my soul
carry it so deeply
in the pockets of my existence
that when i open my eyes
and look down at my new hands
i will already know
denny theres my enzo
enzo i will be ready
i will remember
puppies whimpering
enzo he picked me
out of a pile of pups
a tangled mass
of paws and tails
hed stopped at the farm
on his way home
from the speedway at yakima
denny hey
enzo even back then i knew
i was different than other dogs
my soul just felt more human
this one
chuckles definitely this one
the pick of the litter
enzo she always said that
mr spangle
well just a minute now
we were thinking of
keeping that one
enzo he always said that too
hey
how much
enzo and so
i had my first glimpse
at the rest of my life
music playing on radio
squeals
young enzo barks
music continues playing
indistinct chatter
tony dennys here
tony heyhey

enzo denny seemed
unusually interested
in my bathroom habits
go on go ahead
urinating
denny oh sighs

chuckles

its time to turn in
big day tomorrow at the race
so just be a good boy
get some sleep okay
whimpering
denny groans
young enzo barking
sighs
okay
all right
okay
sniffles
indistinct chatter on tv
sighs okay
of course just rub that in
loud bang
car honks
enzo id later learn
it was called a television
and in time it would teach me
much about human behavior
but that night
it felt like a window
into a whole new world
oh you like that huh
enzo like it
no i loved it
car engines whirring on tv
denny right foot on the gas
ease into the turn
barks
chuckles
indistinct chatter
enzo and even better was
when he took me
to the race itself
man denny
oh look
oh its a puppy
enzo dennys apartment
was home but this
this was where i truly belonged
indistinct shouting
indistinct announcement
over pa
enzo it was more thrilling
than i couldve imagined
car engines roaring
what do you think enzo
enzo i
thought it was heaven on earth
wright whatd you say
his name is again
denny swift
kitch number 96 car
kitch he teaches for me
from time to time
when he needs cash
but you trust me
this kids a diamond
in the rough
crew chief copy that
indistinct chatter
enzo
the heat coming off the track
the breathless speed
and precision of the pit crew
i was in awe of it all
whirring
he did a year in formula three
got picked up
by zip simones audi program
started making a name
for himself
but then zippy went bankrupt
then he lost his ride
engine revving
clear
all applauding
kitch you really serious
about starting your own team
theres your man right there
hes been down almost
a full lap this whole stint
its not about
whos got the heavier foot
its about the feel
thunder rumbling
denny was the first
to make the call
to switch to rain tires
crowd clamoring
step over here
hey watch this
in all my years of racing
ive never seen anyone
like denny in the wet
reminds me what they
used to say about senna
when it rains
it doesnt rain on him
tires screeching
cheering whooping
enzo and when he won
enzo
i felt like id witnessed
true greatness
all cheering
denny yeah
first race huh
whatd you think boy
you like it
did you like it
hey kid you got a minute
hey
i want you to meet sean wright
hey denny swift
he sold his tech company
for some obscene amount of money
and now hes determined
to waste it all racing gts
yeah
i think ive read about you
that was some win today
you think you could drive
that way for him
try me
enzo
my first year went by in a blur
wait let me see
enzo i realize nobody
has a perfect childhood
but id contend
that mine came fairly close
denny began racing
for wright fulltime
and took me with him
whenever he could
like a fourlegged member
of the pit crew
indistinct chatter
denny hey enz you good
enzo i was better than good
crewman go clear
engine revving
tires squeal
enzo
call it fate call it luck
all i knew was
i was meant to be his dog
man cheering
enzo denny always said
the best drivers
focus only on the present
never dwelling on the past
never committing to the future
man shouting indistinctly
go get it
whoo
enzo reflection must come
at a later time
which is why drivers
compulsively record
their every move
with their incar cameras
denny i got to turn earlier
get a better run on that corner
enzo i learned so much
from him about balance
anticipation patience
car goes where your eyes go
enz
enzo and i would fantasize
that one day i too
might actually race
reporter congratulations
on a spectacular win today
not an easy race
by any stretch
well you know
im a risk taker
man that win was all you
this guy hasnt even
mentioned you once
youre way too good
for this guy denny
you got to start getting
your own sponsors
yeah maybe
my drivers look to me
as their leader
turn this clown off
put on the mariners
enzo theres an old saying
id often hear denny repeat
no race was ever won
in the first corner
but many have been lost there
just you and me enz
always you and me
and then accelerating
through
enzo nothing was more
important to us than racing
i knew it was
only a matter of time
before denny reached his goal
of racing formula one in europe
denny whistles come on
enzo barking
enzo and the whole world
would see him the way i did
good boy
enzo hed be adored
by fans everywhere
his victories
the stuff of legend
his name inscribed alongside
the very best
our sport has ever known
chuckles softly
car engines whirring on tv
enzo but for now
he was my champion alone
indistinct chatter
and then she showed up
indistinct
eve that was great
denny yeah
hey
denny enzo this is eve
eve hi enzo
how you doing
enzo my first impression of eve
was as complicated
as the scents in the air
im not really
much of a dog person
enzo a m√©lange of produce
shampoo and pheromones
yeah well
hes more person than dog
enzo denny was clearly taken
with her grooming
she probably bathed every day
for all i knew
does he always stare at people
like this laughs
if he likes them
so are you a chef or something
no i teach english
as a second language
and one of my students is thai
and she made this curry
that was incredible
but it looks like
you have to go
i dont know
whats gotten into him
it was nice to meet you
come here come on
hey uh eve
my uh my friends
they play in a band
and theyre playing a show
at nemos tonight
i thought you know
if you didnt have plans
head injury
yeah theyre seattles
third most popular
soundgarden tribute band
yeah i mean
according to them laughs
eve that sounds like fun
denny it does
mmmhmm
yeah yeah no well
well make it fun
all right ill see you then
denny cool
eve bye
denny come on
i thought you guys rocked
see mike
he was freaking out because
we skipped a verse on spoonman
mike oh we skipped a verse
now imagine this
all throughout high school
so which song was
your favorite
the secondtolast one
the one with
the 12minute guitar solo
yeah that was the best part
laughs denny marry this girl
chuckles uh
do you want another
no thanks
could i have some water
yeah sure mike
mike yep
so uh you two just met huh
eve yeah
and
dude
chuckles and i think
hes really nice
wait till you see him race
then youll really fall in love
dude
what i was just
chuckles
so when do i get
to see you race
laughter
enzo as if denny
would ever fall for that
woman shouting
yes
enzo she knew almost nothing
about racing
but for some reason
denny didnt seem to mind
i assumed she would soon
be in our rearview mirror
but by spring it was clear
eve wasnt going anywhere
all cheering
enzo ill admit i envied the
attention he lavished on her
with her
laughs
opposable thumbs
and plump buttocks
eve in his regular car yes
well what does he know
about teaching english
yeah my point exactly
enzo and her taste
in television programs
left something to be desired
eve will you stop
enzo denny never tired
of pleasing her
all for his reward
which usually meant lots
of stroking and
nuzzling
how was your class
it was good
enzo did i envy
her engaging smile
her effortless laugh
perhaps i did
eve and denny laughing
enzo for she was a person
unlike me
denny mmmhmm kissing
ill go make us some breakfast
gasps really
denny yeah
okay thanks
eve sighs
hey enzo
you dont mind
if i love him too do you
enzo as if i had a say
in the matter
enzo they were married
at a magnificent palace
with its very own ocean
the kind of place i had assumed
only existed on television
i tried my best to be helpful
indistinct chatter
i minded my manners
resisted snacking on the trays
of exquisite appetizers
and made sure to do my business
in the flowerbed farthest
from the festivities
the place belonged
to eves parents
trish and maxwell
who i confess i first mistook
for twins
indistinct chatter
would the bearer please
bring the rings forward
aww
guests chuckling
enzo when the time came
i did as i was instructed
for dennys sake
man chuckles
good boy
come on enz come here bud
denny hey
good boy
denny with this ring
i thee wed
eve
eve with this ring
i thee wed
chuckles
all cheering
enzo and so we became
a family
to varying degrees
of enthusiasm
think he couldve shaved
for his own wedding
maxwell
maxwell what
its just an observation
oh please
no ones good enough for her
in your eyes
i like him i do
but i love my daughter
and the man races cars
for a living
you dont think
im within my rights
to be a little concerned
no not if eve isnt
enzo ive learned
that people will say
just about anything
in front of me
as i am only a dumb dog
i put a call in
to andy neuberger last week
he said a driver whos been
on the circuit
as long as denny has
if it was gonna break for him
most likely wouldve happened
by now
but eve says hes been
doing great lately
i knew id find you two in here
come on its cake time
trish daddy was making
his drink
both laugh
enzo after the wedding came
the move
grunts
enzo i was of two minds
about it
i now had room to roam
but the old apartment was ours
denny and me
indistinct chatter
both laughing
enzo i tried to communicate
my feelings
eve what was that
it was enzo hes just excited
enzo but my gestures
were inevitably misinterpreted
kissing
moreover there was
a mysterious new aura
about eve that for some reason
prevented me from maintaining
any resentment toward her
denny its watkins glen
which i usually do
really well at
eve and thats in new york
right
yeah yeah
you could take a couple days off
and we could
get out there early
im pregnant
wait what
you freaked out
no no im not
wait are you freaked out
a little yeah
chuckles
denny laughing
did you know about this
barks
denny laughs
enzo i never really grasped
the concept of money
and why humans always
seemed to be in need of it
but denny became more and more
preoccupied with it
all right
engine revving
enzo he began to train harder
than ever
he took
on extra teaching sessions
competed in every race he could
ill miss you
enzo this meant
my spending more
and more time alone with eve
come on enz come on
car door closes
enzo to be honest
i still didnt share
dennys overt affection for her
hey buddy thank you so much
groans
enzo but we developed
a rhythm of our own
thats very nice sighs
enzo at times she even
reminded me of my own mother
when she would sigh
and shrug herself
into a prone position
groans oh god
enzo it must be amazing
to have a body
that can carry
an entire creature inside
i mean other than a tapeworm
which ive had
do you want to know
what it feels like
good boy
gasps did you feel that
did you feel that kick
oh sweet boy come here
its okay come here
thats okay
enzo i couldnt imagine
what was going on
inside eves magic sack
where the baby
was being assembled
i just hoped it would look
like me
paper rustling
denny enzo slow down
its your only one
eve its cozy
denny i love it
it probably looks exactly
like the last one
i got you but
laughing
do you like it
i got it from pike place
its 100 percent handmade
chuckles its uh
your favorite shade of pink

chuckles
exhales

groaning and screaming
enzo i didnt know a human

eve screaming
enzo denny missed it

as he was driving through
the night at daytona
announcer on tv
denny swift in the 22 car

a tremendous performance
considering the team was
in 10th place

kisses
zo√´ coos
eve i still dont understand
denny we lost
its no big deal
we were leading by a lap
going into the last stint
and i told murph
i felt up to finishing but
the sponsors were pressuring him
to go with this
wonder kid from california
whod been doing
a bunch of press lately
ten minutes in
the kid hit the wall
totaled the car
but you drove well
yeah it doesnt really mean
a whole lot
if your team doesnt finish
its okay
really
theres gonna be other races
yeah
yeah
oh zo√´ you okay
where is she
its been too long
both laughing
enzo the twins
who rarely visited
now stopped by frequently
to clutter our home
with garish gifts
denny pretended not to mind
but something about the zebra
put me ill at ease
look at those pretty eyes
hello baby girl
dad she needs a change
oh ill do it
eve yeah
trish chuckling
yeah grandmas got you
denny

thanks
i watched some of that race

i wont
you cant promise that
yes i can
i promise you
that i will always provide
for eve and zo√´
no matter what
and i swear to you
that i will put my safety first
even if that means
losing every race that i enter
trish bye bye honey
love you
door closes
enzo it amazed me
the power exerted
by a creature as tiny
as our little zo√´
a power she wielded
over me as well
with no more effort
than the earth
does the moon in its orbit
indistinct chattering
zo√´ cooing and laughing
enzo i was an integral figure
in her entertainment
leaping after tennis balls
and scrambling back
to catch them
then dancing
like a fourlegged clown
to catch them again
run
enzo barks
denny whoa
eve laughing
you ready birthday girl
giggling
okay here we go
enzo i was so immersed
in her world
that id lose count
of the weeks and months
denny and eve
ready steady
go
zo√´ inhales sharply
all cheering
enzo and when she would
tell her playmates
that i was her big brother
my heart would swell with pride
hot potato
eve whoa
zo√´ laughing
ahh
stinky drawers
denny oh shes coming in
go shes coming in hot
good boy
zo√´ giggling
denny laughing
zo√´ everyone has to wait
their turn for a snack
even zebras
right teacher
daddy
hi
grunts
hey im sorry i missed
your dance recital
mommy told me all about it
did you win
no sweet pea not this one
zo√´ better
chuckles
you have no idea
giggles
grunts
thanks for taking care
of our girls enz
okay so what do we got here
zo√´ well this is
my secondgrade class
denny feels like im always
at the track
or getting on a plane
eve feels that way
for me too sometimes
pills clatter
itll get easier
you okay
just a headache
i was up late grading papers
it wasnt supposed
to take this long you know
dreams always been formula one
but it feels
like im just kind
of treading water
hey
no race was ever won
on the first corner
chuckles softly yeah
you still love it dont you
yeah of course yeah
maybe thats not enough
i dont know
apex offered me a seat
at laguna seca for next weekend
i told them i needed to think
about it
youre just tired
yeah
enzo i spent a sleepless night
contemplating
what denny had said
quit racing
he was a racecar driver
the way i was a dog
it was his nature
his destiny
man on tv according
to mongolian folklore
the dogs are able to see
into the spirit world
eve zo√´ honey dinners ready
i want to wait for daddy
eve daddys teaching tonight
five more minutes
eve ugh
okay enzo dinner
yes
enzo and then all my worries
about denny were eclipsed
by a smell
an odor coming from her ears
and sinuses like
decay
like rotting wood
given a facile tongue
i could have warned her
dont give me
a hard time too buddy
enzo instead all i could do
was watch and feel empty inside
because there was nothing
i could do to help her
in the zebras mute stare
i could sense it mocking
my predicament
eve had assigned me
to protect zo√´
exhales softly
but no one had been
assigned to protect eve
car door opens and closes
barking
hey hey shh
youre gonna wake up zo√´
come on
car revving on tv
since when do you
watch my incars
how come you go through
the turns
so much faster than
the other cars
well
most drivers are afraid
of the rain
because its
an unpredictable element
theyre forced to react to it
and if theyre reacting
at speed
then theyre probably too late
so they should be afraid of it
well im afraid
just watching it
yeah but if you intentionally
make the car do something
you dont have to predict
you control the outcome
so you skid the car
before it skids itself
yeah
yeah
when im in a racecar
im the creator
of my own destiny
that which you manifest
is before you
create your own conditions
and rain is just rain
denny chuckles softly
tomorrow morning youre gonna
call the folks at apex
and youre gonna tell them
that youll see them
in laguna seca
and you cant give up not ever
not for us
not for anyone
eve promise me
i promise
enzo at that moment
i finally understood
dennys love for eve
and why for so long
i had been afraid
to love her myself
she was
my unpredictable element
she was my rain
announcer its looking
to be a beautiful day here
at laguna seca raceway
in salinas california
we have a deep field
of 43 gt cars
and an impressive roster
of drivers
object clatters
eve retching
sniffling
clears throat
continues retching
mommy
eve go pack your bag
were gonna
to grandma and grandpas
for a few days
until daddy gets home okay
are you feeling sick
i just really need to rest
eve please
groaning
retching
coughs
come on
enzo it all happened so fast
door lock clicks
in five minutes they were gone
but i wasnt gone
i was still there
denny always said panics
a drivers worst enemy
so i did not panic
i did not overcorrect or freeze
even though i knew
denny wouldnt be home
for at least another two days
but im a dog
and when god denied dogs
the use of thumbs
he gave us the ability
to survive
without food
for extended periods
so although a thumb
wouldve been very helpful
allowing me to turn a doorknob
for instance
my secondbest tool
was my ability
to go without food
the longer
my isolation continued
the more anxious i became
what if denny never returned
indistinct chatter on tv
with only a limited supply
of drinking water
i had no way of knowing
how long id have
to make it last
i sustained myself
with the odd stray cheerio
zo√´ had dropped
and suffered the indignity
of relieving myself
on the mat
waiting for my ordeal to end
car door closes
barking
thunder rumbling
enzo it was roughly 40 hours
into my solitude
when i think
i began to hallucinate
id just discovered
some remnants of spilled yogurt
when i heard a noise
thudding
rock music playing
it was the zebra
barks and growls
i stalked the creature
as it performed
its brutal burlesque
not sure how much more
i could abide
toy squeaks
barks and growls
fabric rips
laughs
growling
snarling
laughs mockingly
enzo i ran out hoping what
i had seen was only in my mind
a demonic vision
driven by lack of glucose
thunder rumbling
but somehow
i knew that it was true
and that something terrible
had happened
tv playing in background
keys jingle
anyone home
enz hey
what are you doing come here
enzo grunts softly
denny enzo come here
whines
come here bud hey
what happened
where is everyone
eve
are eve and zo√´ still there
can i talk to her
yeah im at the house
enzo is here
wait eve wait hold
hes been here the whole time
denny i thought you took him
with you
no i got to go
i got to take care of him
the mat was the only place
you used huh
come here bud
there you go
zo√´ daddy i missed you
denny oh i missed you too
zo√´ can i say hi to my animals
denny yeah go up
im just trying to understand
ugh i felt so sick
i wasnt thinking
the doctor thinks
its maybe something viral
hi buddy hi
enz im so sorry
im so sorry
zo√´ screams
gasps zo√´
zo√´ something happened
to my animals
zo√´ crying
denny this is a mess
i dont understand
why hed do this
zo√´ stop crying
im gonna go find him
get over here
get over here
whines
bad dog come on
look what you did
look what you did
denny you see that
why would you do that
denny bad dog
you stupid dog
denny stop
eve what are you doing
enzo i had only one thought
the zebra must have
reassembled itself
and attacked the remaining
animals after i left
i shouldve destroyed the demon
when i had the chance
i shouldve eaten it
even if it killed me
zo√´ sobbing
im so sorry enz
i promise ill never do
that again
denny youre a tough old dog
come on
come on
i won by the way
like first in class
first overall
gasping
plus a permanent seat
in the apex prototype
eve oh my god denny
oh my god
laughs they want me down
in sonoma
to start training
with the team right away
im so proud of you
i was thinking
we could all go on the road
yes
maybe at least for the summer
yeah go to all the races
and everything
enzo in racing your car goes
where your eyes go
a driver who cannot tear
his gaze from the wall
will inevitably meet that wall
but the driver
who looks down the track
as he feels
his tires break free
that driver
will maintain control
of his car and his destiny
i realized this was
what denny had done
he had manifested a win
because he knew we needed one
indistinct chatter
eve keys
okay ill call you tonight
okay
bye bud hey kiddo
i need that
chuckles lets see
thank you thank you
have fun

sighs
exhales sharply
breathing heavily

when the urge to speak

enzo continues barking
sirens wailing

enzo i would have done
anything to stay with him
but being a dog
i was not allowed
into the hospital
to hear the diagnosis
or the options being discussed
i was almost ten years old
but no one confided in me
or expected anything except
that i control my barking
and do my business outside
indistinct chatter
somewhere the zebra was dancing
i thought about escaping
i wanted to push everyone away
and run off to live
with my ancestors
on the high desert plains
of mongolia
i might have too
if not for my absolute faith
in dennys ability
to make things right again
indistinct chatter
shes out of surgery
now we just wait and
see how she responds
hey pal
enzo a transmission gear snaps
the clutch fails
brakes go soft from overheating
the poor driver will crash
the average driver will quit
but the great driver
will drive through the problem

enzo the people who cared
about denny
made special accommodations
mike got him some parttime
work at the garage
and looked after me
whenever denny asked
ow
enzo and there were
other skills
he was forced to master
zo√´ youre hurting me
denny okay
im sorry
enzo zo√´ spent
the hot summer days
at a kids camp
over by green lake
hi sweetheart
enzo and the occasional
night with the twins
trish bye
here we go
enzo on those nights
denny would stay late
at the hospital with eve
when wed come home
he would be very quiet
sighs
enzo and then it would fall
to me to provide what he needed
exhales
enzo by autumn
wed come to resemble
something like
a seasoned pit crew
anticipating adjusting
correcting
wait sweetheart here

bye
bye
bye enzo
bye
what do you say enz
youre gonna like this one
you ready
hey zo√´

chuckles oh
no fair
its the red cars fault
denny well yes and no
see youve got to be in charge
of your position on the track
thats what
the red car was doing
at some point in every race
you got to take a risk
if you want to win
in singsong
slow hands in the fast stuff
fast hands in the slow stuff
chuckles oh my god
your mom is gonna kill me
enzo that night
denny got the call
the doctors were finally
allowing eve to come home
only she wouldnt be coming home
to us
why cant mommy stay with us
denny well she will soon
but we thought since
your grandparents
are home all the time
itd be best if she just stayed
with them
just for now
mommys here
chuckling
oh zo√´
eve thats fine mom
eve oh my baby
ive been waiting for this
me too
enzo whines
its still her boy
chuckles
eve mmm
zo√´ and it was snowing
on a squirrel
it was snowing on a beaver
and it was snowing on everyone
but then he said
oh look just as we thought
and boggan said whishhhh
charles wrote his wish
on a piece of paper
denny i dont understand
what exactly are you asking
maxwell and i think zo√´
should stay here with us
at least until
until what
are we just assuming now
that shes not gonna make it
maxwell were all praying
for the best
but you heard
what her doctor said
this might be the only time
zo√´ has with her mother
trish i can drive her to
and from school
or you can
trish whatever you want
and youre welcome
to stay here too
we just didnt think that you
its really up to you

enzo it must be so difficult
being a person
sometimes i doubt my ability
to interact on such a level
but i know its required
if im to become the human
i hope to be
take care of our girls enzo
enzo i stayed awake
all that night
and many others that followed
the demon was coming for eve
but he would have
to get through me first
only once the others awoke
did i dare relinquish
my guard duties
lazy dog
enzo on some nights
denny kept watch with me
but he couldnt rest
in the morning
grunting
i got it i got it okay
he had to stay strong for zo√´
tugowar what about this one

enzo and when eves parents
doted on zo√´ he let them
he understood this was their way
of pushing out of their minds
what was happening
to their own daughter
indistinct chattering
enzo a task that was
of course impossible
denny hey im back
where are you guys
barking
music playing on stereo
hi
surprise
denny laughs
whats the surprise
just come
eve we decided to have a party
were having a party
i think
im a little underdressed
you look incredibly handsome
are you sure youre up for this
i want to come home
i want you home
so bad you have no idea
music continues playing
do you see
eve do you
im not afraid of it anymore
because i know its not the end
but you knew that didnt you
you know everything
enzo not everything no
eve exhales deeply
enzo but i know this
eves last breath
freed her soul
i saw it leave myself
released to continue
its journey elsewhere
denny sniffles
exhales
denny thats nice
thats a baby game
i have to be a grownup now
sighs deeply
trish just fixed zo√´ something
to eat
thank you
sighs all those people
all her old friends
students of hers
yeah everyone loved her
i thought id be ready
you know
i mean
i knew it was coming but
i wasnt ready
not at all
well to be honest
denny thats
whats concerning us a little
that you havent made
any preparations
you dont seem to have
a plan in place
plan i dont
zo√´s eating an egg
and some toast
we just started
oh i thought
im sorry started what
can one of you tell me
what exactly is going on here
um
maxwell
and i have been talking and
we were wondering if maybe
the best situation
for all of us involved
might be if zo√´ continued
to live here with us
scoffs what
maxwell
she needs stability right now
and frankly we dont think
youre in a position
to provide that
maxwell not if youre
gonna return to racing
are you gonna go back to racing
of course yeah
not right away but
and when you do
whos gonna take care
of zo√´ then
i will
like you did eve
maxwell
what the hell is that supposed
to mean
denny please
none of us has the heart
to argue about this right now
maybe if youd been around more
youd have noticed
something was wrong
maybe it couldve been caught
in time
trish thats not true
hes upset denny
hes just upset
you dont think
that i asked the doctors
that question a thousand times
we all know theres nothing
anybody couldve done
thats not what this is about
zo√´ is coming home with me
end of discussion
we just want to consider
whats best for zo√´
whats best for zo√´
is that she is with her father
and if you want to have
any relationship with her
i suggest you stop pushing
this issue right now
see whatd i tell you
but you could still be
in her life
just as much as you want to
we have the time and the money
to care for her
the way eve would have wanted
you can continue to pursue
your racing fulltime
im done
im done listening to this
youre giving us
no other choice
maxwell
you promised me you wouldnt
stammers
denny are you kidding me
i just buried my wife
and youre suing me
for custody of my daughter
sobs denny im so sorry
this is not at all
what we thought
zo√´ finished my egg
sweetheart go inside
and pack your things
were gonna go home right now
everythings fine honey
your dad has some things
to take care of
so youll stay with us for now
zo√´ go and get your stuff
were leaving
who the hell
do you think you are
maxwell you cant do this alone
and you know it
what happens when
youre back to disappearing
for days on end
at those races of yours
youre on a plane every weekend
you missed her birth
for christ sakes
youre not taking her
grunts
oh my god
groaning
are you
im fine
i said im fine
denny please let her stay
just for now
the lawyers could come up
with a compromise
denny zo√´
well come back later
for your dolls okay
okay
get in the car sweetheart
youre making a big mistake
enzo get in
not now enzo
scoffs
what okay
chatter on tv
enzo i didnt know what was on
i only knew he needed
a distraction
it was something eve used to do
when denny was down
okay you crazy dog
enzo it turned out to be
the 1989 luxembourg grand prix
in which the irish driver
kevin finnerty york
finished victorious
while driving the final 20 laps
with only two gears
a true champion
can accomplish things
a normal person
would consider impossible
denny just needed
to remember that
denny thanks for taking
my call at home mark
youre the only lawyer
that i know
and youre the only mechanic
i trust
chuckles
mark relax denny
from what you told me
on the phone
this is openandshut
where is your daughter now
she wanted to go to school
should i have kept her at home
no thats good
youre responding to her needs
theyre trying to claim
youre an unfit parent
because of the intrinsic
dangers of your occupation
maxwell
its a totally bogus suit
cant imagine why they
even bothered to file it
ill demand a summary judgment
and thatll be that
youre saying
theres not even a chance
this is washington state
the child is always awarded
to the biological parent
no question
breathes deeply
afternoon officers
you dennis swift
ill just check if hes still
in the back
im denny swift
would you step out
from behind the counter sir
okay
we have a warrant
for your arrest
denny some kind of joke
place your hands on the counter
and spread your legs
okay
enzo barking
hey buddy its okay
denny can you tell me
how long this will take
you have the right
to remain silent
i need to pick my daughter
up from school
denny
i can pick her up for you
no call mark finn
hell know what to do
do you understand your rights
yeah i understand
this way please
call mark finn
stay
tony what are you
arresting him for
enzo id only felt
such helplessness once before
the day eve collapsed
in the woods
mark coffee tomorrow morning
830 sharp
well go over everything then
all right
all right
we tried picking zo√´ up
from school but
i know her grandparents got
to her first
they timed this thing
on purpose man
come on
thanks mike
mark fourthdegree assault
is a gross misdemeanor
so its unlikely
youll see any real jail time
but we both know
thats not what this is about
theres almost no chance
youll be awarded custody
if youre convicted
scoffs
now because
of the criminal charges
the judge granted
a temporary restraining order
that means youre looking
at 90 days
before you can see zo√´ again
no
denny no i cant not see
mark youre gonna have to
eves parents already filed
a motion
to terminate your rights
mark this is crazy
he grabbed me
any witnesses
trish i guess
but her back was to us
denny i can talk to her
no do not speak to either
of them i mean it
youll jeopardize
your entire case
now to explain your absence
to zo√´
we have agreed to invent a story
about you driving
for a team in europe
i also managed to negotiate
a letter exchange
ninety days
enzo the injustice
was unbearable
first denny lost eve
and now he would be deprived
of zo√´ too
denny struggled
as the weeks passed
chuckles softly
enzo while i very much wish
to be human
there is one advantage to being
a dog that i will miss
what do you think enz
barks
enzo it is this
a dog can power down his psyche
and slow his metabolism
he can sit for hours on end
with no effort
a dog can change
the tempo of the world
but people are at its mercy
phone ringing
hello
mark on phone
whats the deal with the dog
huh
mark the dog
zo√´s been asking
her grandparents to see the dog
of course she can see enzo
tell her hes been staying
at mikes
and i can have mike
drop enzo off this weekend
mark okay ill float it
okay
thanks mark
mark listen my secretary says
we sent you an invoice
yeah i paid that
mark that was
your prior invoice
i realize you cant leave
the state
so racing is not an option
but i have people working
on this
paralegals support staff
yeah i know mark ill
find a way to pay you
sniffles
enzo it was hard to comprehend
this turn our lives had taken
zo√´ giggles
come here enz
make sure you wipe his paws off
before he comes in
grandma just had
the carpets cleaned
okay giggling
singing hey little enzo
so nice to see you
i miss daddy dont you
enzo for the first time
in my life
i was glad i couldnt talk
i wouldnt know
what to tell her
chuckling
enzo after zo√´ went to sleep
i took the opportunity
to spy on the twins
the man put me on the ground
i cracked a rib for gods sake
you saw what happened
the lawyer said
the whole case hinges
on you corroborating
my statement
you need to testify
enzo inside me
a darkness was brewing
just remember
who were doing this for okay
our granddaughter
thats all that matters
enzo and i was not above
using the tools of my dogness
to exact justice
what
you like pepper
maxwell
enzo i knew that pepper
was bad for me
but i ate it anyway
good huh
enzo after all
im just a stupid dog
its the second longest
bull market weve ever seen
potential sellers
have not bailed out
enzo i watched and i waited
enzos stomach growling
as in my stomach
a foul concoction steeped
enzo farting
sniffing
maxwell come on
we got to go outside come on
stomach growling
come on lets go
lets get busy come on
come on lets go
lets get busy
oh no no no
no no no no
defecating
maxwell trish get down here
the dog just took a liquid dump
on the carpet
maxwell wheres the bucket
ohhh god
maxwell trish

enzo you get busy mister
your eyes are already forward
looking at that next turn
mmmhmm

mike yeah
from what i understand
enzo wasnt exactly
the ideal houseguest
okay well
were almost finished up here
enzo itd been years
since these old eyes
had seen a live track
i didnt realize
just how much id missed it
i even felt the tug
of my old dream
of driving in a real racecar
alongside him
kitch all right
lets checker the session
clear the track
all the students
to the grandstand
nobody head home yet
hey denny got a minute
denny give me a second

engine revving
people whooping cheering

thank you mr pantoni but

that keep me from leaving
the country right now
don explained to me
all about your troubles
but if your situation
should change
my phone is on the card
it was a pleasure
denny thank you sir
come on
engine revving
hes asked
about you over the years
when i told him what you
went through with eve
he said he wanted to hire you
huh
all i know is he respects
how youre fighting
for your daughter
and what if i dont win
kitch theres no dishonor
in losing the race
theres only dishonor
in not racing
because youre afraid to lose
now go find your students
get back on the track
thats where you belong
clicks tongue come on
enzo ninety days seemed
an eternity even for me
but at long last
day 90 arrived
hey
daddy
denny oh
hi chuckles
enzo
enzo barking
mark ill be back
for her by six
denny okay
take care
thanks
chuckling
mmm missed you
zo√´ missed you
come on i made something
special for dinner
utensils clattering
daddy
are you gonna go back
to europe soon
no not yet sweetheart
yay
but zo you need to stay
with your grandparents
for just a little while longer
okay
no i want to come home
i know you do
and i want you to
more than anything but
the lawyers still need
to make a decision
about where its best
for you to live
okay thats just part
of what happens
when someones mommy dies
just tell them
tell them i want to live
back home with you and enzo
denny okay
ill tell them
bye daddy
bye baby
denny sighs
youll get her every other
weekend until the trial
after that
its all or nothing
tapping on glass
look denny
i know this isnt what you
want to hear right now
but their attorney
made it clear to me
the suit the criminal charges
it can all go away tomorrow
if you dropped
your custody claim to zo√´
now i have an obligation
to make sure you understand
we have leverage now
im talking visitation
privileges
things were gonna have
a much harder time securing
if youre found guilty
of assault
and zo√´s grandparents
are awarded custody
leverage
im not saying we cant win
we might
but we could also lose big
cant lose mark
denny anyone can lose
you of all people
should know that
look just
just give it some thought
car door closes
car engine starts
enzo i knew
what denny was thinking
if he just had
a steering wheel to hold onto
his hands wouldnt shake
just you and me enzo
thats what hed always say
when wed take our night runs
come on enz lets go
enzo but not that night
we were together but alone
i began to devise a plan
wed drive
to zo√´s school one day
pick her up unannounced
and then head straight
for montreal
where they host
a grand prix every summer
enz
enzo stay where you are
enzo no
enzo whimpers
denny gasps
oh god
i i didnt see him
its not your fault
enzo it was mine stupid
is he okay
denny hes still breathing
um
enzo im so stupid
lets get him in your car
panting
enzo your car goes
where your eyes go
how could i forget
ayrton senna did not have
to die at imola
thats what i was thinking
on the way to the hospital
he struck the concrete barrier
at the tamburello corner
at 190 miles an hour
but by all accounts
he wouldve survived
if not for a small piece
of suspension
that managed
to penetrate his helmet
straight to the back
enzo but i know the truth
senna died that day
because his body
had served its purpose
his soul had learned
what it came here to learn
and i knew that
if i had already learned
what i was meant to
i too would be gone
but apparently
i still had work to do
doctor fair amount
of internal bleeding
also some renal damage
he is very lucky
it could have been far worse
i have to be honest
with you mr swift
an old dog like yours
this kind of injurys often
the beginning of the end
xrays sedative pain meds
and nighttime emergency fee
comes to 812
thank you
machine beeps
nurse im sorry
your card was declined
oh
okay um heres my debit
machine beeps
uh it says insufficient funds
is there a problem
uh i deposited my paycheck
today so it
probably just needs to clear
i do have some cash i have
i can go to the bank
first thing in the morning
and bring the rest by then
its fine these things happen
write a receipt for the 300
leave a note for susan
to invoice
the balance in the morning
actually
are you okay
if i keep just twenty of it
thank you
denny you ready to go home
huh pal
enzo the medication kept me
in a nearconstant dream state
for weeks
which i confess came
as a relief
audience cheering faintly
anything to replace that look
id seen on dennys face
mark its not for me to say
whether its the right decision
or not
but for what its worth
i support you
on this a hundred percent
me too
youre doing
what you have to do
zo√´ will understand
when shes older
the visitation schedule
will be as we discussed
plus three weeks in the summer
a week at christmas
and the april school break
but what about the charges
mark theyll be dropped
immediately
like i said denny
we had leverage
enzo a sharp panic rose
in my throat
i need a pen
enzo was i still dreaming
who was this person
this imposter
what had he done with denny
sorry only one i could find
enzo and then all was revealed
mmm it wasnt denny
it was the zebra
id been in a position
to prevent the demon
from destroying zo√´s toys
and id failed
i knew i had to stop it
but how
enzo give me those papers
come here
tony whered he go
mike out the window
tony laughing
denny enzo
you give me those papers
its not funny tony
enzo drop it no
mike laughing
i mean its kind of funny
okay you made your point
you made your point
mike and tony laughing
call their lawyers
tell em well see em in court
denny im with enzo
on this one
youre sure
i made eve a promise
im not quitting
man i got to get me a dog
all chuckling
indistinct chatter
enzo denny was prepared
to risk everything
lose the case
and he would lose zo√´
his breathing that morning
struck me as unusual
exhales sharply
enzo deep inhalations
quick exhalations
it was a sound i recognized
it was the way he breathed
just before a race
this is it enz
doorbell ringing
its tony
hey man thanks for coming by
i wouldve brought him
by the shop
but he hasnt been doing
too good lately
tony yeah poor little guy
denny hey enz
look whos here its tony
hey enz buddy
how you doing hmm
good luck den
thanks man yeah
you want to watch tv
barks softly
enzo dogs are not allowed
in court
so i was forced to imagine
what was happening across town
i invented whole scenes
in my head
fueled by dennys nightly
retelling of the days events
as well as my own admittedly
melodramatic sensibility
objection your honor
enzo perhaps it was
my advanced age
but i found my imagination
increasingly prone to wandering
no sir
i most definitely did not
enzo until
phone ringing
man 1 on tv isnt it
possible at some point
you decided to speed up
barking
man 2 your honor i object
asked and answered
man 1 how
sighs
yeah clears throat
man 1 on tv you dont even
remember killing
um im on my way
tony somethings happened bud
you want to come
barks
whats going on den
enzo with some effort
i was able to decipher
what had happened
so help me god
enzo today was the day
trish had testified
can you please tell the court
about the alleged assault
trish it happened the way
my husband said it did
prosecutor so you personally
witnessed dennis swift
throw your husband
a man 20 years his senior
o the ground
fracturing a rib
and very nearly his wrist
yes
prosecutor thank you
no further questions
sighs
you can step down now
judge im going to suggest
that we take a brief recess here
while i review all of
the testimony and materials
stutters i cant
people murmuring
excuse me
i cant
stutters i cant do this
i thought i could but i just
i didnt see anything
im only saying
what you told me to say
im sorry
but i cant do this anymore
i know that denny
loved eve too much
to ever hurt her father
objection the witness
is clearly speculating
its your witness counselor
mark they dropped the charges
all of it tossed out
both laugh
you did it denny
its over man
all laughing
barks
enzo hed done it
dennys risk had paid off
if a driver has the courage
to create his own conditions
then the rain is simply rain
daddy
i missed you
denny oh i missed you
enzo barking
