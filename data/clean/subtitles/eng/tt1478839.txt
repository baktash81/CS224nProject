i have no words i can rely on 
because my tongue was designed
long and flat
and is therefore
an ineffective tool
for making complicated
polysyllabic sounds 
and that is why i m here now   
waiting for denny
to come home   
lying in a puddle
of my own making 
 keys jingling 
door unlocks 
denny  yo  enz 
 door closes 
 footsteps approaching 
enzo 
enzo  i hear the worry
in his voice 
denny  what happened  pal 
oh  enz 
enzo 
i can smell the day on him 
motor oil and gasoline
and roast chicken 
denny  can you get up  bud 
i m here  buddy 
denny  i m right here 
okay 
enzo  if only i could speak   
i would tell him not to worry 
i saw a documentary
about mongolia on tv once 
in mongolia 
they believe that when a dog
has finished living
his lifetimes as a dog 
his next incarnation
will be as a man 
i m right here  bud 
there he is 
enzo  i realize this would mean
losing all my memories 
my experiences 
but i have a plan 
i will try to imprint
what i know on my soul 
carry it so deeply
in the pockets of my existence
that when i open my eyes
and look down at my new hands 
i will already know 
denny  there s my enzo 
enzo  i will be ready 
i will remember 
 puppies whimpering 
enzo  he picked me
out of a pile of pups 
a tangled mass
of paws and tails 
he d stopped at the farm
on his way home
  from the speedway at yakima 
  denny  hey 
enzo  even back then  i knew
i was different than other dogs 
my soul just felt more    human 
this one 
 chuckles  definitely this one 
  the pick of the litter 
  enzo  she always said that 
mr  spangle 
well  just a minute now 
we were thinking of
keeping that one 
enzo  he always said that  too 
hey 
how much 
enzo  and so 
i had my first glimpse
at the rest of my life 
 music playing on radio 
 squeals 
 young enzo barks 
 music continues playing 
 indistinct chatter 
tony  denny s here 
tony  hey hey 
denny  ah  just wait for it 
i didn t know
you were getting a puppy 
denny  neither did i 
saw a sign on the road and 
i don t know

 enzo   you mean like ferrari 
that s rad 
you can t look after a dog 
you re never home 
oh  you re gonna ruin

on the road with me 
he can be my good luck charm 
tony  hey  you coming

the scoffs at the dive 
oh  no  he can t  he s got
a new puppy to look after

i got the call this morning 
they need an extra driver 
yeah  sure  yeah  i ll  uh 
leave you a pass at the gate 
okay  two passes 
who is this guy again 
that s right 
  enzo  i liked my new home 
   sniffing 
it only lacked for grass 
but i figured i could make do 
  enzo  no 
   whines 
don  i got to call you back 
and    go ahead 
okay  bud  fire away 
enzo  denny seemed
unusually interested
in my bathroom habits 
go on  go ahead 
 urinating 
denny  oh     sighs 
of course  you did 
 chuckles 
okay  pal   
it s time to turn in 
big day tomorrow at the race 
so just be a good boy 
get some sleep  okay 
 whimpering 
 denny groans 
   young enzo barking 
   sighs 
okay 
all right 
okay 
 sniffles 
 indistinct chatter on tv 
 sighs  okay 
of course  just rub that in   
   loud bang 
   car honks 
enzo  i d later learn
it was called a television 
and  in time  it would teach me
much about human behavior 
but that night 
it felt like a window
into a whole new world 
oh  you like that  huh 
enzo  like it 
no  i loved it 
 car engines whirring on tv 
denny  right foot on the gas 
ease into the turn 
 barks 
 chuckles 
 indistinct chatter 
enzo  and even better was
when he took me
to the race itself 
man  denny 
  oh  look 
  oh  it s a puppy 
enzo  denny s apartment
was home  but this   
this was where i truly belonged 
 indistinct shouting 
 indistinct announcement
over pa 
enzo  it was more thrilling
than i could ve imagined 
 car engines roaring 
what do you think  enzo 
enzo  i
thought it was heaven on earth 
wright  what d you say
his name is again 
denny swift 
kitch  number 96 car 
kitch  he teaches for me
from time to time
when he needs cash 
but you trust me 
this kid s a diamond
in the rough 
crew chief  copy that 
 indistinct chatter 
enzo 
the heat coming off the track 
the breathless speed
and precision of the pit crew   
i was in awe of it all 
 whirring 
he did a year in formula three 
got picked up
by zip simone s audi program 
started making a name
for himself 
but then zippy went bankrupt 
then he lost his ride 
 engine revving 
clear 
 all applauding 
kitch  you really serious
about starting your own team 
there s your man right there 
he s been down almost
a full lap this whole stint 
it s not about
who s got the heavier foot 
it s about the feel 
 thunder rumbling 
denny was the first
to make the call
to switch to rain tires 
 crowd clamoring 
step over here 
hey  watch this 
in all my years of racing 
i ve never seen anyone
like denny in the wet 
reminds me what they
used to say about senna 
 when it rains 
it doesn t rain on him  
 tires screeching 
 cheering  whooping 
  enzo  and when he won   
  enzo 
   i felt like i d witnessed
true greatness 
 all cheering 
denny  yeah 
first race  huh 
what d you think  boy 
you like it 
did you like it 
  hey  kid  you got a minute 
  hey 
i want you to meet sean wright 
hey  denny swift 
he sold his tech company
for some obscene amount of money
and now he s determined
to waste it all racing gts 
yeah 
i think i ve read about you 
that was some win today 
you think you could drive
that way for him 
try me 
enzo 
my first year went by in a blur 
wait  let me see 
enzo  i realize nobody
has a perfect childhood 
but i d contend
that mine came fairly close 
denny began racing
for wright full time
and took me with him
whenever he could 
like a four legged member
of the pit crew 
 indistinct chatter 
denny  hey  enz  you good 
enzo  i was better than good 
crewman  go  clear 
   engine revving 
   tires squeal 
enzo 
call it fate  call it luck 
all i knew was
i was meant to be his dog 
 man cheering 
enzo  denny always said
the best drivers
focus only on the present 
never dwelling on the past 
never committing to the future 
 man shouting indistinctly 
  go get it 
  whoo 
enzo  reflection must come
at a later time 
which is why drivers
compulsively record
their every move
with their in car cameras 
denny  i got to turn earlier 
get a better run on that corner 
enzo  i learned so much
from him about balance 
anticipation  patience 
car goes where your eyes go 
enz 
enzo  and i would fantasize
that one day i  too 
might actually race 
reporter  congratulations
on a spectacular win today 
not an easy race 
by any stretch 
well  you know 
i m a risk taker 
man  that win was all you 
this guy hasn t even
mentioned you once 
you re way too good
for this guy  denny 
you got to start getting
your own sponsors 
yeah  maybe 
my drivers look to me
as their leader   
turn this clown off 
put on the mariners 
enzo  there s an old saying
i d often hear denny repeat 
 no race was ever won
in the first corner
but many have been lost there  
just you and me  enz 
always you and me 
   and then accelerating
through 
enzo  nothing was more
important to us than racing 
i knew it was
only a matter of time
before denny reached his goal
of racing formula one in europe 
  denny   whistles  come on 
   enzo barking 
enzo  and the whole world
would see him the way i did 
good boy 
enzo  he d be adored
by fans everywhere 
his victories
the stuff of legend 
his name inscribed alongside
the very best
our sport has ever known 
 chuckles softly 
 car engines whirring on tv 
enzo  but for now 
he was my champion alone 
 indistinct chatter 
and then she showed up 
 indistinct 
  eve  that was great 
  denny  yeah 
hey 
denny  enzo  this is eve 
eve  hi  enzo 
how you doing 
enzo  my first impression of eve
was as complicated
as the scents in the air 
i m not really
much of a dog person 
enzo  a mélange of produce 
shampoo and pheromones 
yeah  well 
he s more person than dog 
enzo  denny was clearly taken
with her grooming 
she probably bathed every day 
for all i knew 
does he always stare at people
like this   laughs 
if he likes them 
so  are you a chef or something 
no  i teach english
as a second language 
and one of my students is thai 
and she made this curry
that was incredible 
but it looks like
you have to go 
i don t know
what s gotten into him 
it was nice to meet you 
come here  come on 
hey  uh  eve 
my  uh    my friends 
they play in a band
and they re playing a show
at nemo s tonight 
i thought  you know 
if you didn t have plans   
 head injury  
yeah  they re seattle s
third most popular   
 soundgarden tribute band  
yeah  i mean 
according to them   laughs 
eve  that sounds like fun 
  denny  it does 
  mmm hmm 
yeah  yeah  no  we ll   
we ll make it fun 
  all right  i ll see you then 
  denny  cool 
eve  bye 
denny  come on 
  i thought you guys rocked 
  see  mike 
he was freaking out because
we skipped a verse on spoonman 
mike  oh  we skipped a verse 
now imagine this
all throughout high school 
so  which song was
your favorite 
the    second to last one 
the one with
the 12 minute guitar solo 
yeah  that was the best part 
 laughs  denny  marry this girl 
 chuckles  uh 
do you want another 
no  thanks 
could i have some water 
  yeah  sure  mike 
  mike  yep 
so  uh    you two just met  huh 
eve  yeah 
  and 
  dude 
 chuckles  and i think
he s really nice 
wait till you see him race 
then you ll really fall in love 
dude 
  what  i was just   
   chuckles 
so  when do i get
to see you race 
 laughter 
enzo  as if denny
would ever fall for that 
   woman shouting 
  yes 
enzo  she knew almost nothing
about racing 
but for some reason 
denny didn t seem to mind 
i assumed she would soon
be in our rearview mirror 
but by spring  it was clear
eve wasn t going anywhere 
 all cheering 
enzo  i ll admit i envied the
attention he lavished on her 
  with her   
   laughs 
   opposable thumbs
and plump buttocks 
eve  in his regular car  yes 
well  what does he know
about teaching english 
yeah  my point exactly 
enzo  and her taste
in television programs
left something to be desired 
eve  will you stop 
enzo  denny never tired
of pleasing her 
all for his reward 
which usually meant lots
of stroking and   
nuzzling 
  how was your class 
  it was good 
enzo  did i envy
her engaging smile 
her effortless laugh 
perhaps i did 
 eve and denny laughing 
enzo  for she was a person 
unlike me 
denny  mmm hmm   kissing 
i ll go make us some breakfast 
   gasps  really 
  denny  yeah 
okay  thanks 
 eve sighs 
hey  enzo 
you don t mind
if i love him too  do you 
enzo  as if i had a say
in the matter 
enzo  they were married
at a magnificent palace
with its very own ocean 
the kind of place i had assumed
only existed on television 
i tried my best to be helpful 
 indistinct chatter 
i minded my manners 
resisted snacking on the trays
of exquisite appetizers
and made sure to do my business
in the flowerbed farthest
from the festivities 
the place belonged
to eve s parents 
trish and maxwell   
who i confess i first mistook
for twins 
 indistinct chatter 
would the bearer please
bring the rings forward 
aww 
 guests chuckling 
enzo  when the time came 
i did as i was instructed 
for denny s sake 
 man chuckles 
  good boy 
  come on  enz  come here  bud 
denny  hey 
good boy 
denny  with this ring 
i thee wed 
eve 
eve  with this ring 
i thee wed 
 chuckles 
 all cheering 
enzo  and so  we became
a family   
to varying degrees
of enthusiasm 
think he could ve shaved
for his own wedding 
  maxwell 
  maxwell  what 
it s just an observation 
oh  please 
no one s good enough for her
in your eyes 
i like him  i do 
but i love my daughter
and the man races cars
for a living 
you don t think
i m within my rights
  to be a little concerned 
  no  not if eve isn t 
enzo  i ve learned
that people will say
just about anything
in front of me 
as i am only a dumb dog 
i put a call in
to andy neuberger last week 
he said a driver who s been
on the circuit
as long as denny has 
if it was gonna break for him 
most likely would ve happened
by now 
but eve says he s been
doing great lately 
i knew i d find you two in here 
come on  it s cake time 
trish  daddy was making
his drink 
 both laugh 
enzo  after the wedding came
the move 
 grunts 
enzo  i was of two minds
about it 
i now had room to roam 
but the old apartment was ours 
denny and me 
 indistinct chatter 
 both laughing 
enzo  i tried to communicate
my feelings 
  eve  what was that 
  it was enzo  he s just excited 
enzo  but my gestures
were inevitably misinterpreted 
 kissing 
moreover  there was
a mysterious new aura
about eve that  for some reason 
prevented me from maintaining
any resentment toward her 
denny  it s watkins glen 
which i usually do
really well at 
eve  and that s in new york 
right 
yeah  yeah 
you could take a couple days off
and we could
get out there early 
i m pregnant 
wait  what 
you freaked out 
no  no  i m not 
wait  are you freaked out 
a little  yeah 
 chuckles 
 denny laughing 
did you know about this 
   barks 
   denny laughs 
enzo  i never really grasped
the concept of money
and why humans always
seemed to be in need of it 
but denny became more and more
preoccupied with it 
  all right 
   engine revving 
enzo  he began to train harder
than ever 
he took
on extra teaching sessions 
competed in every race he could 
i ll miss you 
enzo  this meant
my spending more
and more time alone with eve 
  come on  enz  come on 
   car door closes 
enzo  to be honest 
i still didn t share
denny s overt affection for her 
hey  buddy  thank you so much 
 groans 
enzo  but we developed
a rhythm of our own 
that s very nice   sighs 
enzo  at times  she even
reminded me of my own mother
when she would sigh
and shrug herself
  into a prone position 
   groans  oh  god 
enzo  it must be amazing
to have a body
that can carry
an entire creature inside 
i mean  other than a tapeworm 
which i ve had 
do you want to know
what it feels like 
good boy 
 gasps  did you feel that 
did you feel that kick 
oh  sweet boy  come here 
it s okay  come here 
that s okay 
enzo  i couldn t imagine
what was going on
inside eve s magic sack
where the baby
was being assembled 
i just hoped it would look
like me 
 paper rustling 
denny  enzo    slow down 
it s your only one 
  eve  it s cozy 
  denny  i love it 
it probably looks exactly
like the last one
  i got you  but   
   laughing 
do you like it 
i got it from pike place 
it s 100 percent handmade 
 chuckles  it s  uh   
your favorite shade of pink

about timing    at all 
when have you known me
to be early for anything 
 groaning and screaming 
enzo  i didn t know a human
could make such sounds 
 eve screaming 
enzo  denny missed it
all however 
as he was driving through
the night at daytona 
announcer   on tv 
denny swift in the  22 car
putting in
a tremendous performance 
considering the team was
in 10th place

to make
this perfect little thing 
   kisses 
   zoë coos 
eve  i still don t understand 
denny  we lost 
it s no big deal 
we were leading by a lap
going into the last stint 
and    i told murph
i felt up to finishing  but   
the sponsors were pressuring him
to go with this
wonder kid from california
who d been doing
a bunch of press lately 
ten minutes in 
the kid hit the wall 
totaled the car 
but you drove well 
yeah  it doesn t really mean
a whole lot
if your team doesn t finish 
it s okay 
really 
there s gonna be other races 
  yeah 
  yeah 
oh  zoë  you okay 
where is she 
it s been too long 
 both laughing 
enzo  the twins 
who rarely visited 
now stopped by frequently
to clutter our home
with garish gifts 
denny pretended not to mind 
but something about the zebra
put me ill at ease 
look at those pretty eyes 
hello  baby girl 
  dad  she needs a change 
  oh  i ll do it 
  eve  yeah 
   trish chuckling 
yeah  grandma s got you

no matter what 
and i swear to you
that i will put my safety first 
even if that means
losing every race that i enter 
trish  bye  bye  honey 
love you 
 door closes 
enzo  it amazed me 
the power exerted
by a creature as tiny
as our little zoë 
a power she wielded
over me as well   
with no more effort
than the earth
does the moon in its orbit 
 indistinct chattering 
 zoë cooing and laughing 
enzo  i was an integral figure
in her entertainment 
leaping after tennis balls
and scrambling back
to catch them
then dancing
like a four legged clown
to catch them again 
  run 
   enzo barks 
denny  whoa 
 eve laughing 
  you ready  birthday girl 
   giggling 
okay  here we go 
enzo  i was so immersed
in her world
that i d lose count
of the weeks and months 
denny and eve 
ready  steady   
  go 
   zoë inhales sharply 
 all cheering 
enzo  and when she would
tell her playmates
that i was her big brother 
my heart would swell with pride 
hot potato 
  eve  whoa 
   zoë laughing 
  ahh 
  stinky drawers 
denny  oh  she s coming in 
go  she s coming in hot 
good boy 
 zoë giggling 
 denny laughing 
zoë  everyone has to wait
their turn for a snack 
even zebras 
right  teacher 
  daddy 
  hi 
 grunts 
hey  i m sorry i missed
your dance recital 
mommy told me all about it 
  did you win 
  no  sweet pea  not this one 
  zoë  better 
   chuckles 
  you have no idea 
   giggles 
 grunts 
thanks for taking care
of our girls  enz 
okay  so what do we got here 
zoë  well  this is
my second grade class 
denny  feels like i m always
at the track
or getting on a plane 
eve  feels that way
for me too sometimes 
 pills clatter 
it ll get easier 
you okay 
just a headache 
i was up late grading papers 
it wasn t supposed
to take this long  you know 
dream s always been formula one 
but it feels   
like i m just kind
of treading water 
hey   
no race was ever won
on the first corner 
 chuckles softly  yeah 
you still love it  don t you 
yeah  of course  yeah 
maybe that s not enough 
i don t know 
apex offered me a seat
at laguna seca for next weekend 
i told them i needed to think
about it 
you re just tired 
yeah 
enzo  i spent a sleepless night
contemplating
what denny had said 
quit racing 
he was a racecar driver
the way i was a dog 
it was his nature 
his destiny 
man   on tv  according
to mongolian folklore 
the dogs are able to see
into the spirit world   
eve  zoë  honey  dinner s ready 
i want to wait for daddy 
eve  daddy s teaching tonight 
  five more minutes 
  eve  ugh 
okay  enzo  dinner 
yes 
enzo  and then all my worries
about denny were eclipsed
by a smell 
an odor coming from her ears
and sinuses like   
decay 
like rotting wood 
given a facile tongue 
i could have warned her 
don t give me
a hard time  too  buddy 
enzo  instead  all i could do
was watch and feel empty inside
because there was nothing
i could do to help her 
in the zebra s mute stare 
i could sense it mocking
my predicament 
eve had assigned me
to protect zoë 
 exhales softly 
but no one had been
assigned to protect eve 
 car door opens and closes 
 barking 
hey  hey  shh 
you re gonna wake up zoë 
come on 
 car revving on tv 
since when do you
watch my in cars 
how come you go through
the turns
so much faster than
the other cars 
well   
most drivers are afraid
of the rain 
because it s
an unpredictable element 
they re forced to react to it 
and if they re reacting
at speed   
then they re probably too late 
so they should be afraid of it 
well  i m afraid
just watching it 
yeah  but if you intentionally
make the car do something 
you don t have to predict 
you control the outcome 
so  you skid the car
before it skids itself 
yeah 
yeah 
when i m in a racecar 
i m the creator
of my own destiny 
 that which you manifest
is before you  
create your own conditions
and rain is just rain 
 denny chuckles softly 
tomorrow morning you re gonna
call the folks at apex
and you re gonna tell them
that you ll see them
in laguna seca 
and you can t give up  not ever 
not for us 
not for anyone 
eve  promise me 
i promise 
enzo  at that moment 
i finally understood
denny s love for eve
and why for so long
i had been afraid
to love her myself 
she was
my unpredictable element 
she was my rain 
announcer  it s looking
to be a beautiful day here
at laguna seca raceway
in salinas  california 
we have a deep field
of 43 gt cars
and an impressive roster
  of drivers 
   object clatters 
 eve retching 
 sniffling 
 clears throat 
 continues retching 
  mommy 
  eve  go pack your bag 
we re gonna
to grandma and grandpa s
for a few days
until daddy gets home  okay 
are you feeling sick 
i just really need to rest 
eve  please 
 groaning 
 retching 
 coughs 
come on 
enzo  it all happened so fast 
 door lock clicks 
in five minutes they were gone 
but i wasn t gone 
i was still there 
denny always said panic s
a driver s worst enemy 
so  i did not panic 
i did not overcorrect or freeze 
even though i knew
denny wouldn t be home
for at least another two days 
but i m a dog 
and when god denied dogs
the use of thumbs 
he gave us the ability
to survive
without food
for extended periods 
so  although a thumb
would ve been very helpful 
allowing me to turn a doorknob 
for instance 
my second best tool
was my ability
to go without food 
the longer
my isolation continued 
the more anxious i became 
  what if denny never returned 
   indistinct chatter on tv 
with only a limited supply
of drinking water 
i had no way of knowing
how long i d have
to make it last 
i sustained myself
with the odd stray cheerio
zoë had dropped   
and suffered the indignity
of relieving myself
on the mat   
waiting for my ordeal to end 
 car door closes 
 barking 
 thunder rumbling 
enzo  it was roughly 40 hours
into my solitude
when i think
i began to hallucinate 
i d just discovered
some remnants of spilled yogurt
when i heard a noise 
 thudding 
 rock music playing 
it was the zebra 
 barks and growls 
i stalked the creature
as it performed
its brutal burlesque
not sure how much more
  i could abide 
   toy squeaks 
 barks and growls 
 fabric rips 
 laughs 
 growling 
 snarling 
 laughs mockingly 
enzo  i ran out  hoping what
i had seen was only in my mind 
a demonic vision
driven by lack of glucose 
 thunder rumbling 
but somehow 
i knew that it was true
and that something terrible
had happened 
 tv playing in background 
 keys jingle 
anyone home 
enz  hey 
what are you doing  come here 
 enzo grunts softly 
denny  enzo  come here 
 whines 
come here  bud  hey 
what happened 
where is everyone 
eve 
are eve and zoë still there 
can i talk to her 
yeah  i m at the house 
enzo is here 
wait  eve  wait  hold   
he s been here the whole time 
denny  i thought you took him
with you 
no  i got to go 
i got to take care of him 
the mat was the only place
you used  huh 
come here  bud 
there you go 
  zoë  daddy  i missed you 
  denny  oh  i missed you  too 
zoë  can i say hi to my animals 
denny  yeah  go up 
i m just trying to understand 
ugh  i felt so sick
i wasn t thinking 
the doctor thinks
it s maybe something viral 
hi  buddy  hi 
enz  i m so sorry 
  i m so sorry 
   zoë screams 
 gasps  zoë 
zoë  something happened
to my animals 
   zoë crying 
  denny  this is a mess 
i don t understand
why he d do this 
zoë  stop crying 
i m gonna go find him 
get over here 
  get over here 
   whines 
bad dog  come on 
look what you did 
look what you did 
denny  you see that 
why would you do that 
denny  bad dog 
  you stupid dog 
  denny  stop 
eve  what are you doing 
enzo  i had only one thought 
the zebra must have
reassembled itself
and attacked the remaining
animals after i left 
i should ve destroyed the demon
when i had the chance 
i should ve eaten it 
even if it killed me 
 zoë sobbing 
i m so sorry  enz 
i promise i ll never do
that again 
denny  you re a tough old dog 
come on 
come on 
i won  by the way 
like first in class 
first overall 
   gasping 
  plus  a permanent seat
in the apex prototype 
eve  oh  my god  denny 
oh  my god 
 laughs  they want me down
in sonoma
to start training
with the team right away 
i m so proud of you 
i was thinking
we could all go on the road 
  yes 
  maybe at least for the summer 
yeah  go to all the races
and everything 
enzo  in racing  your car goes
where your eyes go 
a driver who cannot tear
his gaze from the wall
will inevitably meet that wall 
but the driver
who looks down the track
as he feels
his tires break free 
that driver
will maintain control
of his car and his destiny 
i realized this was
what denny had done 
he had manifested a win
because he knew we needed one 
 indistinct chatter 
eve  keys 
  okay  i ll call you tonight 
  okay 
bye  bud  hey  kiddo 
i need that 
 chuckles  let s see 
thank you  thank you 
  have fun

  bye 
 sighs 
 exhales sharply 
 breathing heavily 
it s okay 
i m okay 
 barking 
enzo  there are moments
when the urge to speak
is truly maddening 
 enzo continues barking 
 sirens wailing 
woman  there s a number 
enzo  sometimes i hate
what i am 
denny  hey  come on 
come here 
yeah    she s gonna be okay 
  appreciate this  mike 
  mike  no problem  man 
they re talking about
not even doing a biopsy 
just go in and get it   
malignant or not 
mike  you  um

i have to be here 
okay  enzo  you re gonna bunk
with uncle mike tonight 
what do you say about that 
you be good for mike  okay 
see you in a couple days 
enzo  i would have done
anything to stay with him 
but being a dog 
i was not allowed
into the hospital
to hear the diagnosis
or the options being discussed 
i was almost ten years old
but no one confided in me 
or expected anything except
that i control my barking
and do my business outside 
 indistinct chatter 
somewhere the zebra was dancing 
i thought about escaping 
i wanted to push everyone away
and run off to live
with my ancestors
on the high desert plains
of mongolia 
i might have  too 
if not for my absolute faith
in denny s ability
to make things right again 
 indistinct chatter 
she s out of surgery 
now we just wait and   
see how she responds 
hey  pal 
enzo  a transmission gear snaps
the clutch fails 
brakes go soft from overheating 
the poor driver will crash 
the average driver will quit 
but the great driver
will drive through the problem 
hey  listen 
i have to teach tomorrow 
so you re gonna go to
caroline s house after school
and i ll pick you up at six 
okay 
okay 
daddy 
yeah 
when s mommy gonna come home 
i don t know  pal 
soon  i hope 
enzo  the great driver finds
a way to keep racing 
good night  daddy 
  love you 
  love you  too 
 exhales 
 indistinct chatter 
oh  what s the matter 
you like grilled cheese 
but it s gonna be cold
by lunchtime 
give your dad a break 
denny  i m kinda learning
on the job here  kiddo 
your wife works too  huh 
my mommy s in the hospital 
her brain got sick 
denny  okay  so i m gonna

but today s tuesday 
i have an extended day 
okay  so what time is that over 
ask mommy  she knows 
  bye  sweetheart

zoë  hi  mommy 
enzo  days became weeks 
and still eve did not come
home from the hospital 
you re gonna be okay 
zoë  everything s gonna be okay 
maybe you should sit down now 
enzo  the people who cared
about denny
made special accommodations 
mike got him some part time
work at the garage
and looked after me
whenever denny asked 
ow 
enzo  and there were
other skills
he was forced to master 
  zoë  you re hurting me 
  denny  okay 
i m sorry 
enzo  zoë spent
the hot summer days
at a kids  camp
over by green lake   
hi  sweetheart 
enzo     and the occasional
night with the twins 
trish  bye 
here we go 
enzo  on those nights 
denny would stay late
at the hospital with eve 
when we d come home 
he would be very quiet 
 sighs 
enzo  and then it would fall
to me to provide what he needed 
 exhales 
enzo  by autumn 
we d come to resemble
something like
a seasoned pit crew 
anticipating  adjusting 
correcting 
wait  sweetheart  here 
here s your lunch 
  thanks  daddy 
  okay  see you later 
  bye 
  bye 
bye  enzo 
bye 
what do you say  enz 
you re gonna like this one 
you ready 
hey  zoë 
dinner 
announcer   on tv  benjamin
is going around the outside 
  and it s wilson and neal 
   chuckles  oh 
no fair 
it s the red car s fault 
denny  well  yes and no 
see  you ve got to be in charge
of your position on the track 
that s what
the red car was doing 
at some point  in every race
you got to take a risk
if you want to win 
 in sing song 
 slow hands in the fast stuff 
fast hands in the slow stuff  
 chuckles  oh  my god 
your mom is gonna kill me 
enzo  that night 
denny got the call 
the doctors were finally
allowing eve to come home 
only she wouldn t be coming home
to us 
why can t mommy stay with us 
denny  well  she will soon 
but we thought since
your grandparents
are home all the time 
it d be best if she just stayed
with them 
just for now 
mommy s here 
 chuckling 
  oh  zoë   
  eve  that s fine  mom 
eve  oh  my baby 
i ve been waiting for this 
me  too 
 enzo whines 
it s still her  boy 
 chuckles 
eve  mmm 
zoë   and it was snowing
on a squirrel 
it was snowing on a beaver
and it was snowing on everyone 
but then he said 
 oh  look  just as we thought  
and boggan said   whishhhh  
charles wrote his wish
on a piece of paper  
denny  i don t understand 
what exactly are you asking 
maxwell and i think zoë
should stay here with us 
at least until   
until what 
are we just assuming now
that she s not gonna make it 
maxwell  we re all praying
for the best 
but you heard
what her doctor said 
this might be the only time
zoë has with her mother 
trish  i can drive her to
and from school 
or you can 
trish  whatever you want 
and you re welcome
to stay here  too 
we just didn t think that you   
it s really up to you 
i ll talk about it with eve 
denny  come on 
they just want to help us 
denny 
i know 
what matters is what you want 
i want my old life back 
has my dad been any better
with you 
he promised he would be 
yeah  he s fine 
we re fine  really  you just   
you just keep focused on you 
okay 
knock wood  in a few weeks
i ll get some strength back
and we can both come home again 
right 
right 
i want you
to start racing again 
you ve been away
from it for too long 
we ll see 
i can t be the reason
that you quit 
you promised me
that you wouldn t quit 
denny  i won t 
i won t 
get some sleep   
okay 
i love you 
i love you so much 
enzo  it must be so difficult
being a person 
sometimes i doubt my ability
to interact on such a level 
but i know it s required
if i m to become the human
i hope to be 
take care of our girls  enzo 
enzo  i stayed awake
all that night
and many others that followed 
the demon was coming for eve 
but he would have
to get through me first 
only once the others awoke
did i dare relinquish
my guard duties 
lazy dog 
enzo  on some nights 
denny kept watch with me 
but he couldn t rest
in the morning 
 grunting 
  i got it  i got it  okay 
  he had to stay strong for zoë 
tug o war  what about this one 
 both laughing 
denny  we ve got a tug o war 
denny  which one s he gonna get 
which one s he gonna get 
 enzo barking 
 denny grunting 
here it goes  i got it 
it s over there 
enz  come here 
good boy 
  trish  remember 
  zoë  yeah 
enzo  his endurance
knew no limits 
denny  ah  hey   
  a tennis racket 
  trish  yeah 
trish  and grandpa got you
lessons at our club
on wednesday afternoons 
won t that be fun 
actually  wednesday s
not that good for me 
i m at the garage all day 
that s all right 
we can drive you  zoë  right 
  yeah 
  yeah 
enzo  and when eve s parents
doted on zoë  he let them 
he understood this was their way
of pushing out of their minds
what was happening
to their own daughter 
 indistinct chattering 
enzo  a task that was 
of course  impossible 
denny  hey  i m back 
where are you guys 
 barking 
 music playing on stereo 
  hi 
  surprise 
denny   laughs 
what s the surprise 
just come 
eve  we decided to have a party 
we re having a party 
i think
i m a little underdressed 
you look incredibly handsome 
are you sure you re up for this 
i want to come home 
i want you home 
so bad  you have no idea 
 music continues playing 
do you see 
eve  do you 
i m not afraid of it anymore 
because i know it s not the end 
but you knew that  didn t you 
you know everything 
enzo  not everything  no 
 eve exhales deeply 
enzo  but i know this 
eve s last breath
freed her soul 
i saw it leave  myself 
released to continue
its journey elsewhere 
 denny sniffles 
 exhales 
denny  that s nice 
that s a baby game 
i have to be a grownup now 
 sighs deeply 
trish just fixed zoë something
to eat 
thank you 
 sighs  all those people 
all her old friends 
students of hers 
yeah  everyone loved her 
i thought i d be ready 
you know 
i mean 
i knew it was coming  but   
i wasn t ready 
not at all 
well  to be honest 
denny  that s   
what s concerning us a little 
that you haven t made
any preparations 
you don t seem to have
a plan in place 
plan  i don t   
zoë s eating an egg
and some toast 
we just started 
oh  i thought   
i m sorry  started what 
can one of you tell me
what exactly is going on here 
um   
maxwell
and i have been talking  and   
we were wondering if maybe
the best situation
for all of us involved
might be if zoë continued
to live here with us 
 scoffs  what 
maxwell 
she needs stability right now 
and  frankly  we don t think
you re in a position
to provide that 
maxwell  not if you re
gonna return to racing 
are you gonna go back to racing 
of course  yeah 
  not right away  but   
  and when you do 
who s gonna take care
of zoë then 
i will 
  like you did eve 
  maxwell 
what the hell is that supposed
to mean 
denny  please 
none of us has the heart
to argue about this right now 
maybe if you d been around more 
you d have noticed
something was wrong 
maybe it could ve been caught
in time 
trish  that s not true 
he s upset  denny 
he s just upset 
you don t think
that i asked the doctors
that question a thousand times 
we all know there s nothing
anybody could ve done 
that s not what this is about 
zoë is coming home with me 
end of discussion 
we just want to consider
what s best for zoë 
what s best for zoë
is that she is with her father 
and if you want to have
any relationship with her 
i suggest you stop pushing
this issue right now 
see  what d i tell you 
but you could still be
in her life 
just as much as you want to 
we have the time and the money
to care for her
the way eve would have wanted 
you can continue to pursue
your racing full time 
i m done 
i m done listening to this 
you re giving us
no other choice 
maxwell 
you promised me you wouldn t 
 stammers 
denny  are you kidding me 
i just buried my wife
and you re suing me
for custody of my daughter  
 sobs  denny  i m so sorry 
this is not at all
what we thought   
zoë  finished my egg 
sweetheart  go inside
and pack your things 
we re gonna go home right now 
everything s fine  honey 
your dad has some things
to take care of 
so you ll stay with us for now 
zoë  go and get your stuff 
we re leaving 
who the hell
do you think you are 
maxwell  you can t do this alone
and you know it 
what happens when
you re back to disappearing
for days on end
at those races of yours 
you re on a plane every weekend 
you missed her birth 
for christ sakes 
you re not taking her 
   grunts 
  oh  my god 
 groaning 
  are you   
  i m fine 
i said i m fine 
denny  please let her stay 
just for now 
the lawyers could come up
with a compromise 
denny  zoë 
we ll come back later
for your dolls  okay 
okay 
get in the car  sweetheart 
you re making a big mistake 
enzo  get in 
not now  enzo 
 scoffs 
what  okay 
 chatter on tv 
enzo  i didn t know what was on 
i only knew he needed
a distraction 
it was something eve used to do
when denny was down 
okay  you crazy dog 
enzo  it turned out to be
the 1989 luxembourg grand prix
in which the irish driver
kevin finnerty york
finished victorious
while driving the final 20 laps
with only two gears 
a true champion
can accomplish things
a normal person
would consider impossible 
denny just needed
to remember that 
denny  thanks for taking
my call at home  mark 
you re the only lawyer
that i know 
and you re the only mechanic
i trust 
 chuckles 
mark  relax  denny 
from what you told me
on the phone 
this is open and shut 
  where is your daughter now 
  she wanted to go to school 
  should i have kept her at home 
  no  that s good 
you re responding to her needs 
they re trying to claim
you re an unfit parent
because of the intrinsic
dangers of your occupation 
maxwell 
it s a totally bogus suit 
can t imagine why they
even bothered to file it 
i ll demand a summary judgment
and that ll be that 
you re saying
there s not even a chance 
this is washington state 
the child is always awarded
to the biological parent 
  no question 
   breathes deeply 
  afternoon  officers 
  you dennis swift 
i ll just check if he s still
in the back 
i m denny swift 
would you step out
from behind the counter  sir 
okay 
we have a warrant
for your arrest 
denny  some kind of joke 
place your hands on the counter
and spread your legs 
  okay 
   enzo barking 
hey  buddy  it s okay 
denny  can you tell me
how long this will take 
you have the right
to remain silent   
i need to pick my daughter
up from school 
denny 
i can pick her up for you 
no  call mark finn 
  he ll know what to do 
  do you understand your rights 
  yeah  i understand 
  this way  please 
call mark finn 
stay 
tony  what are you
arresting him for 
enzo  i d only felt
such helplessness once before 
the day eve collapsed
in the woods 
mark  coffee tomorrow morning 
8 30 sharp 
we ll go over everything then 
all right 
all right 
we tried picking zoë up
from school  but   
i know  her grandparents got
to her first 
they timed this thing
on purpose  man 
come on 
thanks  mike 
mark  fourth degree assault
is a gross misdemeanor 
so it s unlikely
you ll see any real jail time 
but we both know
that s not what this is about 
there s almost no chance
you ll be awarded custody
  if you re convicted 
   scoffs 
now  because
of the criminal charges 
the judge granted
a temporary restraining order 
that means you re looking
at 90 days
before you can see zoë again 
no 
denny  no  i can t not see   
mark  you re gonna have to 
eve s parents already filed
a motion
to terminate your rights 
mark  this is crazy 
he grabbed me 
any witnesses 
trish  i guess 
but her back was to us 
denny  i can talk to her 
no  do not speak to either
of them  i mean it 
you ll jeopardize
your entire case 
now  to explain your absence
to zoë
we have agreed to invent a story
about you driving
for a team in europe 
i also managed to negotiate
a letter exchange 
ninety days 
enzo  the injustice
was unbearable 
first  denny lost eve 
and now he would be deprived
of zoë  too 
denny struggled
as the weeks passed 
 chuckles softly 
enzo  while i very much wish
to be human 
there is one advantage to being
a dog that i will miss 
what do you think  enz 
 barks 
enzo  it is this 
a dog can power down his psyche
and slow his metabolism 
he can sit for hours on end
with no effort 
a dog can change
the tempo of the world 
but people are at its mercy 
 phone ringing 
hello 
mark   on phone 
what s the deal with the dog 
  huh 
  mark  the dog 
zoë s been asking
her grandparents to see the dog 
of course  she can see enzo 
tell her he s been staying
at mike s
and i can have mike
drop enzo off this weekend 
  mark  okay  i ll float it 
  okay 
thanks  mark 
mark  listen  my secretary says
we sent you an invoice 
yeah  i paid that 
mark  that was
your prior invoice 
i realize you can t leave
the state 
so racing is not an option 
but i have people working
on this   
paralegals  support staff 
yeah  i know  mark  i ll   
find a way to pay you 
 sniffles 
enzo  it was hard to comprehend
this turn our lives had taken 
 zoë giggles 
come here  enz 
make sure you wipe his paws off
before he comes in 
grandma just had
the carpets cleaned 
okay   giggling 
 singing  hey  little enzo
so nice to see you   
i miss daddy  don t you 
enzo  for the first time
in my life 
i was glad i couldn t talk 
i wouldn t know
what to tell her 
 chuckling 
enzo  after zoë went to sleep 
i took the opportunity
to spy on the twins 
the man put me on the ground 
i cracked a rib  for god s sake 
you saw what happened 
the lawyer said
the whole case hinges
on you corroborating
my statement 
you need to testify 
enzo  inside me
a darkness was brewing 
just remember
who we re doing this for  okay 
our granddaughter 
that s all that matters 
enzo  and i was not above
using the tools of my dogness
to exact justice 
what 
you like pepper 
maxwell 
enzo  i knew that pepper
was bad for me 
but i ate it anyway 
good  huh 
enzo  after all 
i m just a stupid dog 
it s the second longest
bull market we ve ever seen 
potential sellers
have not bailed out 
enzo  i watched and i waited   
 enzo s stomach growling 
   as in my stomach
a foul concoction steeped 
 enzo farting 
 sniffing 
maxwell  come on 
we got to go outside  come on 
 stomach growling 
come on  let s go 
let s get busy  come on 
come on  let s go 
let s get busy 
oh  no  no  no 
  no  no  no  no 
   defecating 
maxwell  trish  get down here 
the dog just took a liquid dump
on the carpet 
maxwell  where s the bucket 
ohhh  god 
maxwell  trish 
can you get down here 
enzo  you get busy  mister 
your eyes are already forward 
looking at that next turn 
  mmm hmm 
  give me a second  okay 
what happened 
i thought they were keeping him
until tonight

that keep me from leaving
the country right now 
don explained to me
all about your troubles 
but if your situation

my phone is on the card 
it was a pleasure 
denny  thank you  sir 
come on 
 engine revving 
he s asked
about you over the years 
when i told him what you
went through with eve 
  he said he wanted to hire you 
  huh 
all i know is  he respects
how you re fighting
for your daughter 
and what if i don t win 
kitch  there s no dishonor
in losing the race

in not racing
because you re afraid to lose 
now go find your students

 clicks tongue  come on 
enzo  ninety days seemed
an eternity  even for me 
but at long last 
day 90 arrived 
  hey 
  daddy 
denny  oh 
hi   chuckles 
  enzo 
   enzo barking 
mark  i ll be back
for her by six 
denny  okay 
  take care 
  thanks 
 chuckling 
  mmm  missed you 
  zoë  missed you 
come on  i made something
special for dinner 
 utensils clattering 
daddy 
are you gonna go back
to europe soon 
  no  not yet  sweetheart 
  yay 
but  zo  you need to stay
with your grandparents
for just a little while longer 
okay 
no  i want to come home 
i know you do 
and i want you to
more than anything  but   
the lawyers still need
to make a decision
about where it s best
for you to live 
okay  that s just part
of what happens
when someone s mommy dies 
just tell them 
tell them i want to live
back home with you and enzo 
denny  okay 
i ll tell them 
  bye  daddy 
  bye  baby 
 denny sighs 
you ll get her every other
weekend until the trial 
after that   
it s all or nothing 
 tapping on glass 
look  denny   
i know this isn t what you
want to hear right now   
but their attorney
made it clear to me 
the suit  the criminal charges 
it can all go away tomorrow 
if you dropped
your custody claim to zoë 
now  i have an obligation
to make sure you understand   
we have leverage now 
i m talking visitation 
privileges 
things we re gonna have
a much harder time securing 
if you re found guilty
of assault
and zoë s grandparents
are awarded custody 
leverage 
i m not saying we can t win 
we might 
but we could also lose  big 
can t lose  mark 
denny  anyone can lose 
you  of all people 
should know that 
look  just   
just give it some thought 
 car door closes 
 car engine starts 
enzo  i knew
what denny was thinking 
if he just had
a steering wheel to hold onto 
his hands wouldn t shake 
 just you and me  enzo  
that s what he d always say
when we d take our night runs 
come on  enz  let s go 
enzo  but not that night 
we were together  but alone 
i began to devise a plan 
we d drive
to zoë s school one day 
pick her up unannounced
and then head straight
for montreal 
where they host
a grand prix every summer 
enz 
enzo  stay where you are 
enzo  no 
   enzo whimpers 
   denny gasps 
oh  god 
  i    i didn t see him 
  it s not your fault 
enzo  it was mine  stupid 
  is he okay 
  denny  he s still breathing 
  um   
  enzo  i m so stupid 
let s get him in your car 
 panting 
enzo  your car goes
where your eyes go 
how could i forget 
ayrton senna did not have
to die at imola 
that s what i was thinking
on the way to the hospital 
he struck the concrete barrier
at the tamburello corner
at 190 miles an hour 
but  by all accounts 
he would ve survived
if not for a small piece
of suspension
that managed
to penetrate his helmet 
straight to the back 
enzo  but i know the truth 
senna died that day
because his body
had served its purpose 
his soul had learned
what it came here to learn 
and i knew that
if i had already learned
what i was meant to   
i too would be gone 
but apparently 
i still had work to do 
doctor  fair amount
of internal bleeding 
also  some renal damage 
he is very lucky 
it could have been far worse 
i have to be honest
with you  mr  swift 
an old dog like yours 
this kind of injury s often
the beginning of the end 
x rays  sedative  pain meds
and nighttime emergency fee
comes to  812 
thank you 
 machine beeps 
nurse  i m sorry 
your card was declined 
oh 
okay  um    here s my debit 
 machine beeps 
uh  it says insufficient funds 
is there a problem 
uh  i deposited my paycheck
today  so it   
probably just needs to clear 
i do have some cash  i have   
 300 
i can go to the bank
first thing in the morning
and bring the rest by then 
it s fine  these things happen 
write a receipt for the  300 
leave a note for susan
to invoice
the balance in the morning 
actually   
are you okay
if i keep just twenty of it 
thank you 
denny  you ready to go home 
huh  pal 
enzo  the medication kept me
in a near constant dream state
for weeks
which i confess came
as a relief 
 audience cheering faintly 
anything to replace that look
i d seen on denny s face 
mark  it s not for me to say
whether it s the right decision
or not 
but  for what it s worth 
i support you
on this a hundred percent 
me  too 
you re doing
what you have to do 
zoë will understand
when she s older 
the visitation schedule
will be as we discussed 
plus  three weeks in the summer 
a week at christmas 
and the april school break 
but what about the charges 
mark  they ll be dropped
immediately 
like i said  denny 
we had leverage 
enzo  a sharp panic rose
in my throat 
  i need a pen 
  enzo  was i still dreaming 
who was this person 
this imposter 
what had he done with denny 
sorry  only one i could find 
enzo  and then all was revealed 
mmm  it wasn t denny 
it was the zebra 
i d been in a position
to prevent the demon
from destroying zoë s toys
and i d failed 
i knew i had to stop it 
but how 
enzo  give me those papers 
come here 
  tony  where d he go 
  mike  out the window 
 tony laughing 
denny  enzo 
you give me those papers 
it s not funny  tony 
enzo  drop it  no 
 mike laughing 
i mean  it s kind of funny 
okay  you made your point 
you made your point 
 mike and tony laughing 
call their lawyers 
tell  em we ll see  em in court 
denny  i m with enzo
on this one 
you re sure 
i made eve a promise 
i m not quitting 
man  i got to get me a dog 
 all chuckling 
 indistinct chatter 
enzo  denny was prepared
to risk everything 
lose the case
and he would lose zoë 
his breathing that morning
struck me as unusual 
 exhales sharply 
enzo  deep inhalations 
quick exhalations 
it was a sound i recognized 
it was the way he breathed
just before a race 
this is it  enz 
 doorbell ringing 
it s tony 
hey  man  thanks for coming by 
i would ve brought him
by the shop 
but he hasn t been doing
too good lately 
tony  yeah  poor little guy 
denny  hey  enz 
look who s here  it s tony 
hey  enz  buddy 
how you doing  hmm 
  good luck  den 
  thanks  man  yeah 
  you want to watch tv 
   barks softly 
enzo  dogs are not allowed
in court 
so i was forced to imagine
what was happening across town 
i invented whole scenes
in my head
fueled by denny s nightly
retelling of the day s events
as well as my own admittedly
melodramatic sensibility 
objection  your honor 
enzo  perhaps it was
my advanced age
but i found my imagination
increasingly prone to wandering 
no  sir 
i most definitely did not 
enzo  until   
 phone ringing 
man 1   on tv  isn t it
possible at some point
  you decided to speed up 
   barking 
man 2  your honor  i object 
asked and answered 
man 1  how  
 sighs 
yeah   clears throat 
man 1   on tv  you don t even
remember killing   
um  i m on my way 
tony  something s happened  bud 
  you want to come 
   barks 
what s going on  den 
enzo  with some effort 
i was able to decipher
what had happened 
so help me god 
enzo  today was the day
trish had testified 
can you please tell the court
about the alleged assault 
trish  it happened the way
my husband said it did 
prosecutor  so  you personally
witnessed dennis swift
throw your husband 
a man 20 years his senior 
o the ground
fracturing a rib
and very nearly his wrist 
yes 
prosecutor  thank you 
no further questions 
 sighs 
you can step down now 
judge  i m going to suggest
that we take a brief recess here
while i review all of
the testimony and materials 
 stutters  i can t 
 people murmuring 
excuse me 
i can t 
 stutters  i can t do this 
i thought i could  but i just   
i didn t see anything 
i m only saying
what you told me to say 
i m sorry 
but i can t do this anymore 
i know that denny
loved eve too much
to ever hurt her father 
objection  the witness
is clearly speculating 
it s your witness  counselor 
mark  they dropped the charges 
all of it  tossed out 
 both laugh 
you did it  denny 
it s over  man 
   all laughing 
   barks 
enzo  he d done it 
denny s risk had paid off 
if a driver has the courage
to create his own conditions   
then the rain is simply rain 
daddy 
  i missed you 
  denny  oh  i missed you 
 enzo barking 
enzo  zoë was ours again 
denny had won her back 
and it was a victory
for the ages 
 phone ringing 
denny  this is luca pantoni
returning your call 
luca  yes  hi 
thank you for calling me back 
i wanted to let you know
that the   
issues keeping me in the states
have been resolved 
enzo  i could just picture him
on the terrace
of some magnificent villa 
i can tell by your voice
they were resolved
to your satisfaction 
denny  yes  sir

that you d offered me earlier

when a dog dies 
he is buried high in the hills 
so people cannot walk
on his grave 
denny  i m here  buddy

enzo  his master whispers
into the dog s ears
his wishes that in his next life
the dog will return as a man 
not all dogs return as men
