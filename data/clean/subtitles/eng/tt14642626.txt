the basement is calling 
what s in the basement 
 upbeat music 
 music continues 
so back home  we have all of
these strawberry patches  right 
so you can basically pick
your own strawberries
and then pay by the basket 
it s real nice 
so  my aunt libby s
sister in law s cousin
has a niece who knew this lady
who pulled over
to pick some strawberries 
and she had her newborn baby
in her car with her  right 
so she gets out of the car
and she leaves the baby in the
car seat with her milk bottle
and leaves the door open 
so she can hear the
baby cries or anything 
well  the mom 
she s picking berries 
time goes by 
and then it occurs to her
that the baby
hasn t made a sound 
so she goes to check and
you know what she finds 
she finds a snake in
the baby s mouth 
what  oh  god 
dj  yeah  and the mom
freaks out 
and so she pulling the snake 
but she doesn t realize
how far down the baby s throat
the snake has crawled 
so when she pulls the snake out 
the baby s insides come with it 
baby intestines
were everywhere   
oh  my god 
that s so fucking gross 
true story  swear to god 
yeah  that s anatomically
impossible 
dj  no   cause   cause   
i don t think a snake can crawl
into a baby s mouth  right 
well  hold on  no 
that s not true 
 cause the    the baby
just had milk  right 
and snakes are attracted
to milk 
and my aunt libby is a christian
who doesn t lie 
miri  okay  um   
hate to break it to you  but
aunt libby s story is
an old urban legend
that migrated from europe
which derived
from a folktale called
the  bosom serpent  
dj  well  miri
