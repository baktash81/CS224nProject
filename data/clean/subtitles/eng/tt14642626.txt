the basement is calling
whats in the basement
upbeat music
music continues
so back home we have all of
these strawberry patches right
so you can basically pick
your own strawberries
and then pay by the basket
its real nice
so my aunt libbys
sisterinlaws cousin
has a niece who knew this lady
who pulled over
to pick some strawberries
and she had her newborn baby
in her car with her right
so she gets out of the car
and she leaves the baby in the
car seat with her milk bottle
and leaves the door open
so she can hear the
baby cries or anything
well the mom
shes picking berries
time goes by
and then it occurs to her
that the baby
hasnt made a sound
so she goes to check and
you know what she finds
she finds a snake in
the babys mouth
what oh god
dj yeah and the mom
freaks out
and so she pulling the snake
but she doesnt realize
how far down the babys throat
the snake has crawled
so when she pulls the snake out
the babys insides come with it
baby intestines
were everywhere
oh my god
thats so fucking gross
true story swear to god
yeah thats anatomically
impossible
dj no cause cause
i dont think a snake can crawl
into a babys mouth right
well hold on no
thats not true
cause the the baby
just had milk right
and snakes are attracted
to milk
and my aunt libby is a christian
who doesnt lie
miri okay um
hate to break it to you but
aunt libbys story is
an old urban legend
that migrated from europe
which derived
from a folktale called
the bosom serpent
dj well miri

ruined a perfectly good time
