fair size 
take a man on a good horse
all summer to cover it 
it s beautiful 
no place on god s earth more beautiful 
i can see why you left texas
and came here 
well  that wasn t exactly the reason 
i know  mother told me all about it 
about how hard things were in texas
after the war 
she talked about you a lot 
how you gambled everything
on a cattle drive
to some wild  faraway place
called new mexico 
it was a gamble  all right 
and it was wild 
but there was land here
for the taking and keeping 
if you were willing to fight 
rustlers  disease 
the land itself  the indians   
one indian in particular 
comanche chief named white buffalo 
the bravest man i ever knew 
  is he dead now 
  might as well be 
he s penned up on a piece of desert
the government calls a reservation 
that was the end of his way of life 
pretty good way  too 
you sound as if you re sorry for him 
your enemy 
i respect him  we re brothers 
as close as your father and i were 
maybe even closer 
  i don t understand 
  i didn t expect you to 
i wonder what s keeping supper 
sallie  that s mother and dad s
wedding picture 
yeah 
north wind 
tahnimara  the comanches call it 
  lonely wind 
  lonely wind 
you had to be lonely out here
all these years 
you never married 
well  it wasn t because there weren t
women that stirred my blood 
there were 
but this was no place to bring a woman
in those days 
raise a family 
things are different now 
uncle john

thank you for the help 
mr  garrett  was it 
pat garrett 
  texas 
  texas 
  looking for a job

i d appreciate
the loan of a horse  though 
take your choice and keep it 
  thank you 
  you hungry 
no  but i didn t get a chance
to finish that cup of coffee 
coffee 
i think we can do better than that

sallie  i want you to meet pat garrett 
  this is my niece  miss chisum 
  how do you do 
oh  and  uh 
pat garrett  meet billy bonney 
hello 
i ve heard of you 
wasn t rustling 
just out riding 
and his men started shooting at us 
yeah  just out for a moonlight ride
on my land  who was with you 
i got nothing more to say 
don t worry  mr  chisum 
we ll get to the bottom of this 
yes  sheriff 
we will get to the bottom of this 
one of my men is dead  i ve sent for
judge wilson over in mesilla 
there s gonna be a murder trial 
riker  i ought to have a doctor 
  i bled some 
  not enough 
pat  the sheriff s charming 
yeah  well  there s a lot of
charming people hereabouts  pat 
if you change your mind about that job 
let me know 
sounds good enough 
you got time for a drink 
  well   
  bourbon 
just one 
 both laugh 
mcsween  it s a big move for sue and me 
you don t have any idea how big 
i ve only been out here for a short time 
but  well  alex  i m putting together
an organization
that s bigger than anything
the west has ever seen 
land  mining  cattle 
freighting  speculation 
well  that does sound big  and it sounds
like it ll take a lot of doing 
well  you ll find that
i m pretty well connected out here 
here  look at this 
i may be able to show you a shortcut
to the whole proposition  chisum 
call him the king of the pecos 
he got here first  he holds the key 
the pecos river
runs right through the middle of his land 
so 
well  you see  he lets the water flow
to all the ranches  big and small 
now  if another man  with more appetite 
owned that land 
he d control a territory bigger than most
states and bigger than some countries 
  yeah  but another man doesn t 
  i know  not yet 
but you see  that s not just a map 
that s a chessboard 
and if another man makes the right moves 
well  there might just be
a new king of the pecos 
oh  gentlemen  come in 
sheriff brady  jess evans 
this is alex mcsween 
he s part of the family 
  howdy 
  what does he do 
well  he used to be a storekeeper 
and now he s my lawyer 
i prefer storekeepers 
then don t ever get arrested 
i don t intend to 
neither did riker 
  lawrence   
  okay 
yeah  all right  sheriff 
listen  alex 
would you excuse us for a minute 
certainly 
lawrence  first it was neemo  then riker 
now chisum s sent for judge wilson 
  what are we gonna do 
  have some wanted posters printed up 
  on who 
  riker 
  what for 
  your prisoner s going to escape 
  he is 
  he is 
tell him to wait in the line shack
up on bony ridge
until the good judge
gets tired of waiting around 
  how much 
  how much what 
  how much reward   100  or   
  no 
well  don t be a piker  man 
what   200    nobody s gonna collect it 
why get in a frazzle over chisum 
you turn me loose on him 
there ll be a sudden funeral
right here in lincoln 
uh huh 
yours 
how s that 
  do you play chess 
  chess 
now  what the hell has that
got to do with chisum 
everything  you just leave him alone 
i ll take care of mr  chisum 
  that ain t gonna be easy 
  you re right 
but  see  there s a fundamental difference
between mr  chisum and me 
yeah  what s that 
mr  chisum is a man who respects the law 
around here  i m the man who owns it 
dolan  get out of here  you miserable   
 gunshot firing 
next one goes in your gut 
tunstall  put the gun away  william 
  what s the trouble  juan 
  no trouble 
this greaser was just trying to tell me
how to run my business 
and just how did he go about that 
they have nearly doubled the prices 
we can t pay what they ask 
you don t like it  go somewhere else 
maybe they will 
juan  there is no place within 100 miles 
about those prices  mr  murphy 
well  prices are always going up 
sign of a healthy economy 
or a healthier profit 
if he needs some money 
he can always arrange a loan at the bank 
the bank d be happy
to carry a mortgage on his spread 
maybe that s what we need around here 
another bank 
you plan on starting one  mr  chisum 
why not  all it takes is money 
tunstall  yes  we might even
start up a store  too 
just in the spirit of healthy competition 
of course 
talk to you later  henry 
righto  john 
   qué tal  juan 
  regular 
  billy  gracias 
  de nada 
billy 
i see you re still pretty handy
with that six killer 
oh  i hit where i aim 
 bugle plays military cadence 
officer  company  halt 
 officer exclaims 
  well  what else 
  nothing else  colonel 
we brought enough beef
for white buffalo s people to get by 
i ll deliver the rest at the weekend 
if it s all right with you
and with white buffalo 
chisum s word 
colonel  i am not interested in your
opinion of mr  chisum s word 
now  sir  i understand your problem 
but you have to understand mine 
would you mind explaining 
there are many problems attendant to
running a territory as large as this one 
i don t propose to dwell on them
here and now 
well  what do you propose
to do here and now 
i ve already done it 
when i heard what happened to your cattle 
i made arrangements for the delivery
of another herd at a very good price 
didn t take you very long 
i have to do what i feel is right
for the army and for the territory 
all right  colonel  you don t have to
put it in triplicate  i get the idea 
white buffalo 
sergeant braddock will escort you
back to the reservation 
that is all  white buffalo 
  sergeant 
  yes  sir 
  straightaway 
  all right  follow me 
chisum 
into the wagon  into the wagon 
hey  indian 
chisum  this change nothing between us 
you heard the colonel  blanket head 
straightaway 
just a minute  sergeant 
  you know who you re talking to 
  looks like an indian to me 
he s a prince of the comanche nation 
i don t care if he s the king of romania 
the colonel said   straightaway  
let s move it 
hold on  sergeant  have a cigar 
uh 
  have a cigar 
  don t mind 
one other thing
you ought to know  sergeant 
you touch white buffalo again
and i ll kill you

officer  count  em at fours  forward  ho 
all  forward  ho 
well  nathan 
looks like we re in business 
lawrence  look  are you sure
you can provide that much beef 
oh  don t worry  army ll get its beef 
and a lot cheaper than from chisum 
you re in charge of this territory 
not him 
and then  after you ve
served your tour of duty 
you ll be an officer
in the l g  murphy bank 
  your family will like that 
  now  wait a minute 
your bank has nothing to do with this 
i m in the army 
i wouldn t do anything that would   
and i wouldn t ask you to 
i ll take care of the details 
and i wouldn t do anything
to insult your integrity 
pepper  look 
pepper  yup  that s ol  tropadero 
he s led us on many a cattle drive 
he brought your uncle s herd here 
all the way from texas 
you and uncle john have come
a long way together  haven t you 
a long way 
over there s
an old comanche burying ground 
 the lord said unto cain 
 why art thou wroth 
  and why is thy countenance fallen 
  if thou doesn t well 
shalt thou not be accepted 
  and if thou doesn t not well 
  sin lieth at the door  
 and cain talked with abel  his brother 
 and it came to pass 
when they were in the field
 that cain rose up
against his brother and    
slew him 
howdy 
do you always greet people
with so much fanfare 
um  no  ma am 
truth is  i was just   
just what 
well  mr  tunstall loaned me his bible
here so i could practice my reading 
looks like that ain t all
you were practicing 
  which part were you reading  billy

sure has been a passel of  em since then 
there sure has 
so long  bonney 
  keep practicing  billy 
  yes  ma am

it may be a chess game to murphy 
but i don t like his methods 
and i can t go along with him 
well  it s very kind of you
to tell me  alex 
but i m a pretty good chess player myself 
if i were you  mr  chisum

and what would you two want me to do 
stand around and watch   
john  i don t propose we stand around

i ll tell him everything that s going on 
justice wilson will be here
from mesilla soon 
  now  you said he was a good man 
  yes  he is 
well  don t do anything
that ll make it harder for him 
that s true  we wouldn t want him
to have to try you for shooting somebody 
might be a pleasure 
meanwhile  we ll open up
the store and the bank 
and we ll hit murphy where it hurts 
legally  without any more gunfire 
right will prevail  john  i know it will 
yes  henry  right will prevail 
one way or another

i ll leave just as soon as we put

jess

  thank you 
  how s the patient  sallie 
  a little impatient  i m afraid 
  he s getting bored 
  i m just fine  mr  tunstall 
a little buzzing in my head 
but other than that   
 groans softly 
 chuckles 
there is a little hurt when i move 
other than that  he s just fine 
william  i stopped by to say goodbye 
billy  goodbye 
yes  i m going to santa fe for a bit 
to take care of some business 
yeah 
as soon as i m able  i got some business
to take care of in lincoln
with murphy and evans 
william  you are not going to do anything 
from now on 
we do everything according to the law 
  mr  chisum go along with that 
  he does 
now  you ve made a fresh start here 
and you ve got a good future 
and i want you to promise me
that you won t do anything
to jeopardize that future 
you re gonna make me swear on the bible 
no  lad  your word s
always been good enough for me 
no  i thought perhaps you d like to
practice your reading some more
  while i m gone 
  well  thanks  i would 
i ll see you soon  laddie 
  mr  tunstall 
  yeah 
i promise 
oh  uh   
i ve written a little inscription
on the inside 
 to william bonney 
 february 18  1878 
 prepare your heart
to seek the law of the lord 
 and to live by it 
 j  henry tunstall  
pepper  good trip  mr  tunstall 
tunstall  thank you  pepper 
john  i want to thank you
for taking care of william 
not me  sallie 
she s a wonderful girl 
and he s a worthwhile lad 
yeah  henry  according to you 
everybody s worthwhile 
god s children  john 
but william reminds me of someone 
a black sheep in the family  no doubt 
no  a young chap i never even talked to 
years ago in england 
this young man  very much like william 
killed a man in some senseless brawl 
and i watched that young man
walk to the gallows 
and i saw him hanged 
ghastly sight 
there was nothing i could do
to help that young lad  well   
  i hope your way works  henry 
  it will  john  it will 
would you like to listen to my opinion 
mr  john simpson chisum 
nope 
well  my opinion is all this speechifying 
store keeping  prayer meeting
don t amount to a spit in the river 
there s only one thing
gonna make this territory know
who s the bull of the woods 
and sometime or sooner 
it s gonna happen  and you know it 
  do i 
  you do 
it s just gonna be you and murphy 
head to head  and horn to horn 
and one hell of a fight 
but one of you has got to lose 
so  the other one walks away
with the herd and the whole shebang 
now  that s my opinion 
 mooing 
 laughing 
what s so funny 
well  that s the first time i ever put
somebody else s brand on our own cows 
 laughs 
 mooing 
there s your proof  sheriff 
no good cow thief
putting his brand on my cattle 
i expect we ought to do something
about that 
yeah  i expect we ought to 
and you d better hurry  he s leaving town 
all right  you two  go fetch him 
hold tunstall in jail until i get back 
  where are you going 
  santa fe 
i    i ve got to see a friend 
hello 
say  tunstall 
you re a hard man to track down 
  thought you could get away  is that it 
  get away with what 
we re deputy sheriffs  you know 
duly appointed 
my congratulations 
but what s that got to do with me 
got to do with your rustling
mr  murphy s cattle 
gentlemen  in the first place 
the origin of mr  murphy s magic herd
is somewhat dubious 
and in the second place   
in the second place  don t give us any of
that fancy foreign talk  mr  fancy pants 
you re talkin  to the law  and the law
says you re going back to lincoln 
look here  i m going to roswell 
i ve got a stage to catch 
   tunstall grunts 
   horse nickering 
  he didn t even have a gun 
  he had a gun 
and he tried to use it 
preacher   and he opened his mouth 
and taught them  saying 
  blessed are the poor in spirit 
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven 
  blessed are they that mourn 
for they shall be comforted 
  blessed are the meek 
for they shall inherit the earth 
  blessed are they which do hunger
and thirst after righteousness 
  for they shall be filled 
  blessed are the merciful 
for they shall experience mercy 
  blessed are the pure in heart 
for they shall see god 
  blessed are the peacemakers  for they
shall be called the children of the lord 
  blessed are the persecuted
for righteousness  sake 
  for they shall inherit heaven 
  rejoice and be doubly blessed
  for your reward in heaven is great  
 the lord giveth 
and the lord taketh away 
 blessed be the name of the lord  
amen

whatever he does  it ll be legal 
governor  that s hard to believe 
jess evans rode up
right after the shooting 
the man is a thief  he stole my cattle 
we have the hides to prove it 
it s hard to believe about henry tunstall 
yes  and it s hard to believe
he carried a gun  but he did 
he pulled one  resisted arrest 
the deputies were defending themselves 
they had no choice 
that s too bad 
  it s just too bad

and believe me  you re in the firing line 
and you better do something about it
before president hayes decides
that you can t handle this territory 
what do you suggest that i do 
first of all  justice wilson
is a friend of chisum s 
so revoke his powers 
you ve got plenty of grounds 
all right 
i ll do that 
what else 
and you good people witnessed
the cowardly and cold blooded murder
of our beloved sheriff brady by
billy  the kid  bonney  right over there 
governor axtell has appointed
a new sheriff  dan nodeen 
he s offered a  200 reward for the kid 
and i m adding a further reward of  1 000 
dead or alive 
the sheriff here has formed his posse 
have you got anything
you want to add to that  sheriff 
just this 
i m gonna bring bonney in 
you people can either help me 
or stay the hell out of my way 
 tense instrumental music 
john  since governor axtell

there s nothing more i can help you with 
so i ll heading back to mesilla
first thing in the morning 
all right  j  b 
i m writing president hayes a letter
asking for an impartial investigation   
by that time it happens  if it happens 
murphy ll have his name on everything
between arizona and texas 
mr  murphy 
just how much of lincoln county
are you after 
well  mr  chisum came out here
several years ago 
put his name on everything he could 
i ve only been here a little while 
just getting started 
you have anything to say to that 
mr  chisum 
well  i don t favor talking to vermin 
but i ll talk to you just this once 
you re not just getting started 
the line s been drawn 
what billy did balanced the books so far 
but if one of your men cross my land 
or even touch one of my cows 
or do anything to that store 
i m not going to the sheriff 
the governor 
or the president of the united states 
i m coming to see you 
hmm 
mr  chisum  that sounds like a threat 
 murphy grunts 
wrong word  fact 
 clinking 
billy  why did you come back here 
all of lincoln county s looking for you 
they ain t gonna find me 
leastways till i find murphy and evans 
you killed those men 
mr  tunstall was the first man ever
to treat me decent 
he never hurt nobody 
i m gonna get anybody
who had anything to do with it 
  they ll kill you 
  they ll try 
sallie  pat  what are you doing 
maybe he wants the reward 
you know pat garrett better than that 
 breathing

but don t go pulling a gun on me 
get mr  chisum  sallie 
chisum  put it down  pat 
you two walk away 
come on in here  billy 
i know how you feel  but   
you ve gone about it the wrong way 
it s what you d have done 25 years ago 
billy  all you ve done is
bollix things up 
the governor s appointed
another murphy man sheriff 
so 
you can t go around
killing all the sheriffs 
i can t 
you know how this thing s gonna end 
it s my life 
but you re affecting the lives
of a lot of other people 
are you talking about a lot of people 
or sallie 
maybe it funnels down to her  too 
she reminds me of   
there was a girl once back in texas 
a long time ago 
and i knew that the best thing for me
to do was to turn my back 
let her marry a man that d make her happy 
you re talking about garrett now 
i m talking about a man
that could make her happy 
i get your meaning  mr  chisum 
i m not gonna turn you in  billy 
but i m telling you this 
don t ever show up on my land again 
all right  mr  chisum 
i ll ride 
i didn t intend that you should hear that 
i m glad i did 
helps me understand a lot of things 
  your father was a good man 
  yes  he was 
and i know you did what you thought
was right for all of you 
and that s what you re doing now 
maybe you should have let mother
make her own choice 
she did 
she made the right choice 
so will i 
i know you will  sallie 
don t lie to me  you pepper gut 
but i swear to you  señor 
we haven t seen him 
he hasn t been here at all 
well  if he comes here  or rides by

middleton s all right 
and while you re visiting the bank

dolan  i got 500 head of prime cattle

murphy  well  that s what we need

comanches call it tahnimara 
lonely wind 
 chuckles  i wonder where you heard that 
you know  pat 
there have been a lot of stories
about john chisum 
about how wild he was 
now  those were wild times 
i think  in some ways 
the two of them are a lot alike 
who 
uncle john  billy bonney 
don t you think they are 
don t you 
not in the important things 
like what 
well  mr  chisum s changed with the times 
he doesn t like to let on  but he cares 
about the people here and in town 
about the indians and the territory 
he s independent
and he likes to do things his own way 
but he cares 
and billy doesn t 
i guess he can t help it 
but you heard him 
all he cares about is getting those men 
in a way  doesn t it amount
to the same thing 
no 
billy wants revenge 
mr  chisum wants justice 
there s a big difference 
and there s a big difference
between love and infatuation 
what about pat garrett 
pat garrett hasn t talked so much
since sunday school recitation 
 soft chuckle
