rebecca 
  what s going on 
  we re going home 
no  no 
rebecca  please 
i m sorry  mom 
okay 
here we are 
you can take the bed 
or the couch if you want 
no 
this is good 
okay 
cool 
my god 
this your idea 
  what do you mean 
  bring the kid here 
yeah  he s not safe there 
so  you called the lady
at the school 
that s what cps is for 
 child protective services 
exactly this 
  he s my brother 
  and she s his mother 
so 
are you doing this to help him
or to hurt her 
you should leave now 
i know it s a little past dinner time 
so we can call this a midnight snack 
do you want
crust or no crust 
um   
yeah  crust is fine 
can you make them triangles 
yeah 
you re just like your big sister 
i used to think love that  already 
here we go 
okay 
that s good  it s not even   
oh 
sorry  you had a knot 
rebecca 
yeah 
if mom s crazy 
does it mean we re crazy too 
nope 
martin 
hey 
what are you doing down there 
you have to turn the light switch
or   
  did you take martin 
  uh    what 
who is it 
you can t do this 
she s unstable  it s not   
it s not a safe environment for him 
  where is he 
  he s in there getting dress for school 
okay 
  think about what you want to do 
  yeah  i did and i brought him here 
i m not talking about
some knee jerk reaction 
he can t stay here 
he   
sure  he can 
not with   
rebecca  come on 
you know why i m here 
she called me 
so child services takes orders
from nut jobs now 
i stopped by in person to make sure
she was lucid and she was 
but you know what 
that s that s not how this works 
why not 
sophie s his birth mother 
his legal guardian 
to get martin from her custody requires
you to file charges against her 
take her to court 
now that s a long
painful process 
and that s only the first half 
to keep martin from
being placed in foster care
requires you to prove yourself and
your home as an appropriate surrogate 
that s 2 major choices
for you to make 
declaring war on your mother and   
transforming yourself into a
responsible guardian for him 
you ready to do that 
i can be a responsible guardian 
it s okay 
i got some sleep 
i ll be better tonight 
hey 
i got your text  what s up 
  can you take me to my mom s 
  really 
  really 
  hey 
  with this whole thing again 
  what 
no  i ll tell you about it in the car 
what are you doing 
  i think we should talk about last night 
  what 
yeah  how you kicked me out
for being honest with you 
oh 
um 
yeah  i just   
i m sorry 
you were right 
i was using martin to get to mom 
thank you for pointing that out 
  can we    
  mm mm 
you should apologize to martin 
not like that 
but you should still apologize 
okay  i got to
find out about diana 
the bitch is real

and she is sometimes 
but  let me tell you  when things

  what are you doing 
  it s okay  it s alright 
look at me 
trust me  okay 
  i m going to tell you a story 
  mom  please  please 
shhh  baby 
it was a long time ago 
and i had a friend named diana 
she was so different  so special 
and   
look at me 
and later i found out something
really bad happened to her 
but the news  the news
had it wrong  you see 
and she was she was still there 
and she finally came back 
mom  please 
please let go 
no  listen to me 
see    see   
i left her alone for so many years 
i abandoned her 
but now 
she s going to stay  okay 
as long as i keep my head clear
and you keep the lights out 
  no 
  martin 
martin  don t turn on the lights 
diana doesn t know any better 
no  diana 
he doesn t understand 
he didn t mean it 
martin  she didn t mean it 
please don t do this 
wait 
so your mother was in a mental
institution when she was younger 
yeah 
yeah  it looks that way 
you just never talked about it  that s all 
neither did she 
i guess it s not really something
that you talk about 
how about i just listen 
because i m still don t know
who diana is 
she s   
it getting worse 
we need to go shopping  babe 
right 
can you run to the store 
okay 
copy that 
see you in a while 
you want to talk about it now 
i know you don t believe me 
but diana is real 
  she touched my hair 
  hey  hey  hey 
listen to me 
i m going to tell you something   
that nobody ever told me 
i believe you 
  i don t know what she is 
  she doesn t like the light 
okay 
come with me 
okay 
so 
it turns out that your dad was doing a lot
of research into mom and diana s past 
diana was found in a basement
locked away when she was 13 years old  
and her father had killed himself 
 she is in my head
she had a very strange skin disorder 
there were stories about her 
people used to say that
she was evil 
and that she could get inside people s heads 
changed them 
she was taken to
mulberry hill psychiatric hospital
where she met mom 
and i think she got
inside mom s head   
and made her think that
they were friends 
  but they weren t 
  no 
diana only comes around
when mom is at her worst 
i went through it too
when i was your age 
when your dad left 
yeah 
so  what happened to diana 
the doctors tried an experimental treatment
on her and something went wrong 
and she died 
but   
if she s dead   
how could she be
doing this to us 
i don t know 
but i think that mom is the only
connection diana has to this world 
you know  i think if
we can get mom better 
get her mind strong again   
then we can maybe
break that connection 
no 
diana won t let that happen 
why do you say that 
because that s what
my dad was trying to do 
okay  it s the food 
hey 
bret 
stay there 
rebecca 
oh 
oh god 
mom  we need to talk 
what 
can you tell us about diana 
what are you talking about 
your friend  diana 
martin said that
she was here an hour ago 
yes 
she s my friend 
is this your friend  diana 
is this her 
where did you get this 
  answer my question 
  no  you answer mine 
you met diana at mulberry hill
when you were taken there
for your depression 
  am i right 
  what does it matter   
  am i right 
      when we met 
what does it matter
when we met 
because she died 
  she died a year after this photo 
  that is a lie  that is a lie  that is a lie 
i don t know what
you are saying  okay 
  it s the truth  mom  it s the truth 
  okay  stop 
stop 
okay  i understand 
you are trying to take
him away from me again 
you re trying to take my
son away from me again
so you re making up
these wild stories 
i found her obituary  mom 
  explain that 
  you know  those things can be faked 
they can be faked 
you sound crazy 
  listen to her 
  me 
i know  i know 
this all sounds a little crazy 
there s a dead woman
in this house 
and you let her in  mom 
you let her stay 
i know  i see 
i get it 
you came because you feel
bad about leaving me 
am i right 
i didn t hear from you 
you didn t come see me like most people 
do you know how
much that hurt me 
and now   
as it turns out
i ve shutting diana out
the same way all this time 
and i m not going to be the kind
of person that does that to a friend 
a friend 
mom  we re talking about
a dead person 
oh  sweetie
