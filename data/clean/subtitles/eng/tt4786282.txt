were going home
no no
rebecca please
im sorry mom
okay
here we are
you can take the bed
or the couch if you want
no
this is good
okay
cool
my god
this your idea
what do you mean
bring the kid here
yeah hes not safe there
so you called the lady
at the school
thats what cps is for
child protective services
exactly this
hes my brother
and shes his mother
so
are you doing this to help him
or to hurt her
you should leave now
i know its a little past dinner time
so we can call this a midnight snack
do you want
crust or no crust
um
yeah crust is fine
can you make them triangles
yeah
youre just like your big sister
i used to think love that already
here we go
okay
thats good its not even
oh
sorry you had a knot
rebecca
yeah
if moms crazy
does it mean were crazy too
nope
martin
hey
what are you doing down there
you have to turn the light switch
or
did you take martin
uh what
who is it
you cant do this
shes unstable its not
its not a safe environment for him
where is he
hes in there getting dress for school
okay
think about what you want to do
yeah i did and i brought him here
im not talking about
some kneejerk reaction
he cant stay here
he
sure he can
not with
rebecca come on
you know why im here
she called me
so child services takes orders
from nut jobs now
i stopped by in person to make sure
she was lucid and she was
but you know what
thatsthats not how this works
why not
sophies his birth mother
his legal guardian
to get martin from her custody requires
you to file charges against her
take her to court
now thats a long
painful process
and thats only the first half
to keep martin from
being placed in foster care
requires you to prove yourself and
your home as an appropriate surrogate
thats 2 major choices
for you to make
declaring war on your mother and
transforming yourself into a
responsible guardian for him
you ready to do that
i can be a responsible guardian
its okay
i got some sleep
ill be better tonight
hey
i got your text whats up
can you take me to my moms
really
really
hey
with this whole thing again
what
no ill tell you about it in the car
what are you doing
i think we should talk about last night
what
yeah how you kicked me out
for being honest with you
oh
um
yeah i just
im sorry
you were right
i was using martin to get to mom
thank you for pointing that out
can we

i think i need to feel those things
sometimes you know
i think you do too
im okay
rebeccas strong
uh rebecca acts like shes strong
and she is sometimes
but let me tell you when things
got tough she abandoned me
and i dont want that
to happen to you
sometimes the strongest thing to do
is just to face your fears
thats what emma told me
yeah
i think you might be right
ill be back
mom
hey hey hey its all right
its okay love
what are you doing
its okay its alright
look at me
trust me okay
im going to tell you a story
mom please please
shhh baby
it was a long time ago
and i had a friend named diana
she was so different so special
and
look at me
and later i found out something
really bad happened to her
but the news the news
had it wrong you see
and she wasshe was still there
and she finally came back
mom please
please let go
no listen to me
see see
i left her alone for so many years
i abandoned her
but now
shes going to stay okay
as long as i keep my head clear
and you keep the lights out
no
martin
martin dont turn on the lights
diana doesnt know any better
no diana
he doesnt understand
he didnt mean it
martin she didnt mean it
please dont do this
wait
so your mother was in a mental
institution when she was younger
yeah
yeah it looks that way
you just never talked about it thats all
neither did she
i guess its not really something
that you talk about
how about i just listen
because im still dont know
who diana is
shes
it getting worse
we need to go shopping babe
right
can you run to the store
okay
copy that
see you in a while
you want to talk about it now
i know you dont believe me
but diana is real
she touched my hair
hey hey hey
listen to me
im going to tell you something
that nobody ever told me
i believe you
i dont know what she is
she doesnt like the light
okay
come with me
okay
so
it turns out that your dad was doing a lot
of research into mom and dianas past
diana was found in a basement
locked away when she was 13 years old
and her father had killed himself
she is in my head
she had a very strange skin disorder
there were stories about her
people used to say that
she was evil
and that she could get inside peoples heads
changed them
she was taken to
mulberry hill psychiatric hospital
where she met mom
and i think she got
inside moms head
and made her think that
they were friends
but they werent
no
diana only comes around
when mom is at her worst
i went through it too
when i was your age
when your dad left
yeah
so what happened to diana
the doctors tried an experimental treatment
on her and something went wrong
and she died
but
if shes dead
how could she be
doing this to us
i dont know
but i think that mom is the only
connection diana has to this world
you know i think if
we can get mom better
get her mind strong again
then we can maybe
break that connection
no
diana wont let that happen
why do you say that
because thats what
my dad was trying to do
okay its the food
hey
bret
stay there
rebecca
oh
oh god
mom we need to talk
what
can you tell us about diana
what are you talking about
your friend diana
martin said that
she was here an hour ago
yes
shes my friend
is this your friend diana
is this her
where did you get this
answer my question
no you answer mine
you met diana at mulberry hill
when you were taken there
for your depression
am i right
what does it matter
am i right
when we met
what does it matter
when we met
because she died
she died a year after this photo
that is a lie that is a lie that is a lie
i dont know what
you are saying okay
its the truth mom its the truth
okay stop
stop
okay i understand
you are trying to take
him away from me again
youre trying to take my
son away from me again
so youre making up
these wild stories
i found her obituary mom
explain that
you know those things can be faked
they can be faked
you sound crazy
listen to her
me
i know i know
this all sounds a little crazy
theres a dead woman
in this house
and you let her in mom
you let her stay
i know i see
i get it
you came because you feel
bad about leaving me
am i right
i didnt hear from you
you didnt come see me like most people
do you know how
much that hurt me
and now
as it turns out
ive shutting diana out
the same way all this time
and im not going to be the kind
of person that does that to a friend
a friend
mom were talking about
a dead person
oh sweetie
ghosts arent real
then what is she
then what is she
you can sleep over again
at my place tonight
