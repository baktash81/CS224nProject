position 16 16 south  176 47 west 
do you read me  over 
john 
john 
i thought i saw something
between here and the boat 
what is it  a turtle 
no  it s bigger 
  you see anything 
  not yet  hold on 
there it is 
it s a dinghy 
adrift 
no  there s a man in it 
save it  we ll drop down to you 
you hear me  ship your oars 
get the fender  darling 
stand off 
take it easy 
get him some water  darling 
not too much 
  here you are 
  thanks 
my name is hughie warriner 
john ingram  my wife  rae 
i m 32 days outward bound from papeete 
i m heading for fiji 
i only bought her about three months ago 
my plan had been to cruise around
the pacific  to sail around the pacific 
who would have thought  right 
what s your trouble 
trouble is she s going down 
that s the trouble 
she s not gonna last the morning 
are you sure 
yeah  she opened up all over 
has the water hit your engine 
my engine   
   the radio  the fucking bulkhead  galleys 
everything 
my only chance was to try to reach you
in the dinghy 
see what mr  warriner needs  darling 
and get him to bed 
all right 
where are you going 
well  i ought to get over there 
how many people onboard 
nobody  i m alone  i m it 
you tried to take her across the pacific
on your own 
no 
there were six of us 
the others died 10 days ago 
one by one 
it all happened in a day 
what happened 
have you ever thought about how life
can hinge on the smallest thing 
i mean  ever since i was a kid 
i thought salmon was for cats 
was it canned salmon 
yeah 
at first we thought
it was the tourist trots   
   until chantal looked at her hand
and said   
   picasso should have painted it 
it had seven fingers 
double vision  huh 
sounds like botulism 
what s that 
it s a lethal form of food poisoning 
it hits the nervous system 
yeah  well  i tried everything 
there s no treatment 
not on a small boat there s not 
not 1 200 miles from land 
when you re ready  mr  warriner 
we better go and salvage your gear 
my gear  you re looking at it 
there s nothing to salvage 
everything was ruined by the water 
there must be something 
give me a break 
i mean  you know what i had to do 
i can guess 
they ve been dead for days 
you know what that does to a body 
you ve gotta try and stop thinking about it 
i mean  i   
fuck  i can t go back  all right 
i can t go back there right now 
ever 
that s all right  i understand 
why don t you go to bed
and get as much sleep as you can 
thank you 
look  i m really sorry to ruin your day 
  here 
  yeah  straight ahead 
you all right 
yeah

   i just can t swallow it 
any reason 
not really  just 25 years at sea

what have you done to him 
nothing 
he went onboard her 
we ve gotta go back 
he s only got himself to blame  right 
i mean  he should ve trusted me 
but that s always been my problem 
  don t you understand 
  please don t shout 
that s always been one of my problems 
i can never tell people s motives
until it s too late 
let s just turn the boat around 
where shall we go 
  turn around 
  look  you re being very aggressive 
that could be a problem on this small boat 
i ve seen it happen before  it doesn t work 
i was watching you
when you were sleeping 
and i gotta tell you
that your face fascinates me 
even when you re 80  rae 
you ll still be a beautiful woman 
i studied art   
   for a time 
i found that painters 
when they approach their subjects   
   they always look at the face from behind 
from the back  to see what s holding it up 
and you ve got magnificent bone structure 
 magnificent  
shit  that sounds like something   
   you d say at a cocktail party 
should have given you my card 
i just knew we d get along  didn t you 
what s wrong 
would you just tell me one thing 
sure 
i just need to know if that boat is sinking 
sinking 
well  past tense would do 
but  yeah  yes  it is 
why  don t you believe me

  that s why we ve gotta go back 
  back 
  to get john 
  you mean  back there

that s over  so let s erase that one
from memory and start again

all of them 
nobody wants to kill you   
what 
repeat that 
  i said  nobody   
  say the words  come on 
you mean i just imagined it

do you understand
