thanks
my name is hughie warriner
john ingram my wife rae
im 32 days outward bound from papeete
im heading for fiji
i only bought her about three months ago
my plan had been to cruise around
the pacific to sail around the pacific
who would have thought right
whats your trouble
trouble is shes going down
thats the trouble
shes not gonna last the morning
are you sure
yeah she opened up all over
has the water hit your engine
my engine
the radio the fucking bulkhead galleys
everything
my only chance was to try to reach you
in the dinghy
see what mr warriner needs darling
and get him to bed
all right
where are you going
well i ought to get over there
how many people onboard
nobody im alone im it
you tried to take her across the pacific
on your own
no
there were six of us
the others died 10 days ago
one by one
it all happened in a day
what happened
have you ever thought about how life
can hinge on the smallest thing
i mean ever since i was a kid
i thought salmon was for cats
was it canned salmon
yeah
at first we thought
it was the tourist trots
until chantal looked at her hand
and said
picasso should have painted it
it had seven fingers
double vision huh
sounds like botulism
whats that
its a lethal form of food poisoning
it hits the nervous system
yeah well i tried everything
theres no treatment
not on a small boat theres not
not 1200 miles from land
when youre ready mr warriner
we better go and salvage your gear
my gear youre looking at it
theres nothing to salvage
everything was ruined by the water
there must be something
give me a break
i mean you know what i had to do
i can guess
theyve been dead for days
you know what that does to a body
youve gotta try and stop thinking about it
