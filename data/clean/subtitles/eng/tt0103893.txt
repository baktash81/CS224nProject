god  what s your damage

my name is merrick 
and you have been chosen  buffy 
chosen to go to the graveyard  why don t
you just take the first runner up  ok 
everything depends on you  buffy  you must
come to the graveyard while there s still time 
  time to do what 
  time to stop the killing 
  to stop the vampires 
  all right  let me get this straight  ok 
you want me to go
to the graveyard with you   
   because i m the chosen one
and there are vampires 
yes 
does elvis talk to you 
does he tell you to do things 
do you see spots 
spots  yes  of course 
that s your proof  spots 
you bear the mark 
you bear the mark of the coven 
what  that big old hairy mole 
ew  i had that thing removed 
you knowing about my big old mole
doesn t prove anything   
   except for it s way past
medication time for you  buddy 
  why don t you just stay away from me 
  ever dream you were someone else 
  everybody does 
  someone in the past 
someone real 
a magyar peasant girl  perhaps 
an indian princess 
a slave 
  i was a slave 
  in virginia 
i don t know  there was  like 
this big farm or something 
there was this one where
there were these knights  and i am a   
a servant girl  a barmaid 
oh  my god 
oh  my god  i never told anybody about this 
there s one where there s this man 
i think he s a man 
he s in my dreams sometimes 
i m fighting him 
always fighting him  but he s so strong 
his name is lothos 
how do you know all this 
because it is your birthright
and i am a part of it 
you come with me to the graveyard 
and i will show you 
i can t believe i m doing this  i can t believe
i m in a graveyard with a strange man   
   hunting for vampires on a school night 
ew 
why did you never
tell anyone about your dreams 
right  tell everybody i m crazy  beauty idea 
ow 
  cramps 
  none of your business  god 
this is it 
robert berman was killed three days ago

buffy

now  buffy  you go to school
tomorrow and act normally

what s happening  this is important 
because once the vampires find out who you
are  you won t be hunting them any more 
you understand 
they mustn t know your name 
all right 
meet me at this address
tomorrow after school 
  i have cheerleading practice  ok 
  well  you re going to have to skip it 
they can t come in
unless you invite them in  is that true 
  that s true  mm hm 
  good

  around ten 
  i knew this thing was slow 
you pay a fortune for something   
honey  come on  we re gonna be late 
wake up  sweetie  you ll be late for school

  oh  hi  wow  you re late 
  i m gonna practise 
  cool  see you out there 
  ok  bye 
oh  god  what are you doing here 
this is a naked place 
you were supposed to meet me an hour ago 
  i told you that i have practice 
  and i told you to skip it 
listen  i think there s been
a big mistake  all right 
i appreciate there are real vampires
and you re on this big holy mission   
   but obviously somebody read
their tea leaves wrong  cos i m not your girl 
and i don t think i m up to it  and  just
between you and me  neither do you 
it is true 
you have missed years of training 
  see 
  and you are undisciplined 
  frivolous 
  don t i know it 
quite probably
the most vacuous choice in my entire   
ok  ok  i think we both get the point 
right  well  i don t think
there s anything more for us to say 
i guess not 
good luck an  all 
oh  yes 
there is    one thing 
  what 
  this 
bravo 
  you threw a knife at my head 
  yes  i had to show you 
but    you threw a knife at my head 
and you caught it 
only the chosen one could have caught it 
don t you get it 
i don t want to be the chosen one 
i don t wanna spend the rest of my life
chasing after vampires 
all i want to do is graduate from high school 
go to europe  marry christian slater and die 
it may not sound too exciting to
a sconehead like you  but i think it s swell 
you come and tell me i m in the hairy mole
club so you can throw things at me 
buffy  it was necessary 
last night you knew i was
sitting on a fresh grave  didn t you 
yes  because i had to make
you aware of the implica   
oh  wow 
i never hit anybody before 
really  well  you did it perfectly 
i didn t even break a nail 
  yeah
    yeah
    i admit you got the biggest brown eyes
  and you know how
to bite your lips and tantalise
  sure
    yeah
    you can get any girl you want going
  how do you do it 
and don t say you don t know cos you do
  well  baby  i ain t gonna
eat out my heart any more

so when do i meet this guy lothos 
i don t know  when he comes to you
in your dreams  what does he do to you 
how does he make you feel 
he  uh    he scares me 
well  i think we can safely say that
there s something going on with you  buffy 
now  there s nothing to be nervous about 
you re not in any kind of trouble 
don t think of me
as gary murray  administrator 
no  think of me as gary murray  party guy 
happenin  dude who can talk to the young 
  so tell me  it s   
it s drugs  isn t it 
hey  i know where you re coming from 
believe me  i ve had my drug experiences 
oh  yeah  yeah  i did a lot   
well  some acid in the  60s 
  see  i was at a   
i was at a doobie brothers concert 
and i could see the music flowing in 
it was flowing into me 
it was bright red and electric 
and i felt like i was a big toaster  you know 
and i thought  well  maybe
i am a toaster  and we re all molecules  
my friend melissa 
her head looked like a big party balloon 
and that    boy  that scared me  and   
and then i    i started to freak out 
you said you d have the part by two o clock 
christ  it s almost dark 
what nasty bug crawled up your bungus 
where the hell are you goin  
i m leavin   man  i m bailin  town 
this place has gotten way too hairy 
where do i find a mechanic
stupid enough to work for my money 
  seen benny lately 
  no 
hey  what  you want me
to give him a message 
you should think about leaving too  man 
sell this place  there s something going
on here  i don t know  something real weird 
hey  what do you want me
to do if i see benny 
run 
nice night for a walk 
god  it s cold 
dark 
  feelings
  whoa  whoa  whoa  feelings
  boy  i m feeling really helpless
oh  god 
wait 
hello 
toaster caked him 
it was a trap  get it  i led him in 
it was a blind alley  get it  if there d been any
more of them  you would be dead by now 
you must never forget
the cardinal rule  buffy 
one vampire is a lot easier to kill than ten 
does the word  duh  mean anything to you 
you felt sick  didn t you  you had cramps 
nice conversationalist 
yeah  i felt them a little 
but i m not due for a couple of weeks 
since you re so hot on the subject 
no  of course you re not  it was
a natural reaction on the part of a slayer 
a reaction to their unnaturalness 
and you re going to be able
to use that to track them 
great  my secret weapon is pms 
that s just terrific  thanks for telling me 
it s not a weapon  it s an alert system 
well  aren t we kung fu  i don t see
you out there killing any vampires 
i play my part 
you can play with your part all you want 
but it s my neck on the block 
i m out there risking my life 
i m risking my life
and you re not doing anything 
i train girls to be slayers 
i have done so for a hundred lives
and i shall continue to do so 
i am born each time with the knowledge
that my purpose is to prepare the   
   chosen one for her battle 
i am not a slayer 
and i must not interfere  even if i want to 
even if i think that this time
the girl    is truly exceptional 
so   
what do you do  i mean  you just keep on
living the same old life over and over 
  yes  yes  until   
  what  till there aren t any more vampires 
  then what 
  then maybe i ll go to heaven 
or maybe you ll just get ajob 
oh  ajob  i would have been
a wonderful boot maker 
that is so dull  i m going to be a buyer 
  of what 
  i don t know  it s just ajob i heard of 
sounded pretty cool  you know 
buying  buyer  to buy  i like that 
  we should go to work 
  yeah 
quick  before anybody has any fun 
merrick  i m not gonna croak that easily 
i have something the other girls didn t have 
and what might that be  pray 
my keen fashion sense 
vampires of the world  beware

  and i will exhale a primal shout
you know  buffy  you re not like other girls

this is a good thing 
  we close our eyes
  we close our eyes and dream
  and the world has turned around again
  when everybody is running in the big race
  and having a good time
  who am i to cast a shadow 
  who am i 
  i looked death in the face last night   
    and laid siege  if you will 
to the hemery senior dance 
they had fangs  they were biting people 
they had this look in their eyes 
totally cold  animal 
i think they were young republicans 
it was like a nightmare in there 
of course  i had to keep my head  but   
    l ve been there  you know 
yeah  i saw a lot of action in nam 
well  i saw  platoon  
i m very happy to accept this honour   
    and i will try very hard to fulfil
my needs as your next miss america 
i do think the students learned
a valuable lesson about safety 
except the dead ones 
i mean  of course  well  they learned it 
but they really didn t have time
to implement it  you know  and   
are we live 
well  i felt something was wrong 
so we really got outta there before   
i mean  i heard stuff 
we were nearby  we heard   
i can t believe i let you do that to me
