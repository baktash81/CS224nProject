buffy
youre one of those skanky old men that
attacks little girls right well forget you

chosen to go to the graveyard why dont
you just take the first runnerup ok
everything depends on you buffy you must
come to the graveyard while theres still time
time to do what
time to stop the killing
to stop the vampires
all right let me get this straight ok
you want me to go
to the graveyard with you
because im the chosen one
and there are vampires
yes
does elvis talk to you
does he tell you to do things
do you see spots
spots yes of course
thats your proof spots
you bear the mark
you bear the mark of the coven
what that big old hairy mole
ew i had that thing removed
you knowing about my big old mole
doesnt prove anything
except for its way past
medication time for you buddy
why dont you just stay away from me
ever dream you were someone else
everybody does
someone in the past
someone real
a magyar peasant girl perhaps
an indian princess
a slave
i was a slave
in virginia
i dont know there was like
this big farm or something
there was this one where
there were these knights and i am a
a servant girl a barmaid
oh my god
oh my god i never told anybody about this
theres one where theres this man
i think hes a man
hes in my dreams sometimes
im fighting him
always fighting him but hes so strong
his name is lothos
how do you know all this
because it is your birthright
and i am a part of it
you come with me to the graveyard
and i will show you
i cant believe im doing this i cant believe
im in a graveyard with a strange man
hunting for vampires on a school night
ew
why did you never
tell anyone about your dreams
right tell everybody im crazy beauty idea
ow
cramps
none of your business god
this is it
robert berman was killed three days ago
his body was found
in the bushes by the canal
extensive tissue damage
tearing at the neck and shoulders
take these
wait a minute
no no you wont have to do anything
theyre just for your protection sit there
i just need you to watch
all right what do we do now
we wait for robert berman to wake up

tomorrow after school
i have cheerleading practice ok
well youre going to have to skip it

ok bye
oh god what are you doing here
this is a naked place
you were supposed to meet me an hour ago
i told you that i have practice
and i told you to skip it
listen i think theres been
a big mistake all right
i appreciate there are real vampires
and youre on this big holy mission
but obviously somebody read
their tea leaves wrong cos im not your girl
and i dont think im up to it and just
between you and me neither do you
it is true
you have missed years of training
see
and you are undisciplined
frivolous
dont i know it
quite probably
the most vacuous choice in my entire
ok ok i think we both get the point
right well i dont think
theres anything more for us to say
i guess not
good luck an all
oh yes
there is one thing
what
this
bravo
you threw a knife at my head
yes i had to show you
but you threw a knife at my head
and you caught it
only the chosen one could have caught it
dont you get it
i dont want to be the chosen one
i dont wanna spend the rest of my life
chasing after vampires
all i want to do is graduate from high school
go to europe marry christian slater and die
it may not sound too exciting to
a sconehead like you but i think its swell
you come and tell me im in the hairymole
club so you can throw things at me
buffy it was necessary
last night you knew i was
sitting on a fresh grave didnt you
yes because i had to make
you aware of the implica
oh wow
i never hit anybody before
really well you did it perfectly
i didnt even break a nail
yeah
yeah
i admit you got the biggest brown eyes
and you know how
to bite your lips and tantalise
sure
yeah
you can get any girl you want going
how do you do it
and dont say you dont know cos you do
well baby i aint gonna
eat out my heart any more
i aint gonna eat out my heart any more
i aint gonna eat out
my heart any more so quit it
i love you i love you i do boy
but you aint gonna cheat on me
i need you i need you i do boy
chooses a tyranny
chooses it here on me
yeah
just cos i am saying boy
you still think the same
about what ive been saying
yeah
youd better watch your step
or boy youre gonna lose
the best thing you ever had
and i aint gonna eat out my heart any more
i aint gonna eat out my heart any more
i aint gonna eat out
my heart any more so quit it
the heart remember
so when do i meet this guy lothos
i dont know when he comes to you
in your dreams what does he do to you
how does he make you feel
he uh he scares me
well i think we can safely say that
theres something going on with you buffy
now theres nothing to be nervous about
youre not in any kind of trouble
dont think of me
as gary murray administrator
no think of me as gary murray party guy
happenin dude who can talk to the young
so tell me its
its drugs isnt it
hey i know where youre coming from
believe me ive had my drug experiences
oh yeah yeah i did a lot
well some acid in the 60s
see i was at a
i was at a doobie brothers concert
and i could see the music flowing in
it was flowing into me
it was bright red and electric
and i felt like i was a big toaster you know
and i thought well maybe
i am a toaster and were all molecules
my friend melissa
her head looked like a big party balloon
and that boy that scared me and
and then i i started to freak out
you said youd have the part by two oclock
christ its almost dark
what nasty bug crawled up your bungus
where the hell are you goin
im leavin man im bailin town
this place has gotten way too hairy
where do i find a mechanic
stupid enough to work for my money
seen benny lately
no
hey what you want me
to give him a message
you should think about leaving too man
sell this place theres something going
on here i dont know something real weird
hey what do you want me
to do if i see benny
run
nice night for a walk
god its cold
dark
feelings
whoa whoa whoa feelings
boy im feeling really helpless
oh god
wait
hello
toastercaked him
it was a trap get it i led him in
it was a blind alley get it if thered been any
more of them you would be dead by now
you must never forget
the cardinal rule buffy
one vampire is a lot easier to kill than ten
does the word duh mean anything to you
you felt sick didnt you you had cramps
nice conversationalist
yeah i felt them a little
but im not due for a couple of weeks
since youre so hot on the subject
no of course youre not it was
a natural reaction on the part of a slayer
a reaction to their unnaturalness
and youre going to be able
to use that to track them
great my secret weapon is pms
thats just terrific thanks for telling me
its not a weapon its an alert system
well arent we kung fu i dont see
you out there killing any vampires
i play my part
you can play with your part all you want
but its my neck on the block
im out there risking my life
im risking my life
and youre not doing anything
i train girls to be slayers
i have done so for a hundred lives
and i shall continue to do so
i am born each time with the knowledge
that my purpose is to prepare the
chosen one for her battle
i am not a slayer
and i must not interfere even if i want to
even if i think that this time
the girl is truly exceptional
so
what do you do i mean you just keep on
living the same old life over and over
yes yes until
what till there arent any more vampires
then what
then maybe ill go to heaven
or maybe youll just get ajob
oh ajob i would have been
a wonderful bootmaker
that is so dull im going to be a buyer
of what
i dont know its just ajob i heard of
sounded pretty cool you know
buying buyer to buy i like that
we should go to work
yeah
quick before anybody has any fun
merrick im not gonna croak that easily
i have something the other girls didnt have
and what might that be pray
my keen fashion sense
vampires of the world beware
merrick you made ajoke

i looked death in the face last night
and laid siege if you will
to the hemery senior dance
they had fangs they were biting people
they had this look in their eyes
totally cold animal
i think they were young republicans
it was like a nightmare in there
of course i had to keep my head but
lve been there you know
yeah i saw a lot of action in nam
well i saw platoon
im very happy to accept this honour
and i will try very hard to fulfil
my needs as your next miss america
i do think the students learned
a valuable lesson about safety
except the dead ones
i mean of course well they learned it
but they really didnt have time
to implement it you know and
are we live
well i felt something was wrong
so we really got outta there before
i mean i heard stuff
we were nearby we heard
i cant believe i let you do that to me
