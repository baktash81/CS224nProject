kim jahyun s body was found
deeply stabbed in the neck
seeing that it was a cold blooded murder
with nothing valuable stolen
police suspect that the
motive was out of hatred
her husband who disappeared
a year ago is a prime suspect
according to witnesses
her husband  oh daesu
drank often causing
trouble with his wife
and neighbors said
they fought frequently
blood samples found at the scene
matched oh daesu s
fingerprints found on a cup
also matched oh daesu s
it was confirmed by sources that
oh daesu visited his wife recently
the stolen family album
also backs their theories
after three years
many wrinkles have formed on his face

you need the best tools
if you stand aimlessly
at a phone booth on a rainy day
and meet a man whose face is
covered by a violet umbrella 
i d suggest that you get close to the tv

it s your school  home
church  friend
and lover

my lover s song
is too short
this morning around 7 30 the top 50m of
the sungsoo bridge in seoul
suddenly collapsed in the middle   
i wrote down all the people
whom i fought with  bothered  and hurt
this was both my prison journal
and autobiography of my evil deeds
i thought i had lived an average life
but i ve sinned too much
all i thought about at that moment
was that the guy next door
probably ate with one chopstick
but   
but
who would ve imprisoned me 
was it yoo heung sam 
lee so young or kang changsuk 
whoever it was  just wait
wait a bit more
i ll rip your whole body apart
and no one will be able
to find your body anywhere
because i m going to chew it all down
one line for one year
i have to sew six lines
at first
i guess next year will be easier
the more the tattoos
the shorter the chopstick
the shorter the chopstick the
bigger the wall s hole gets

i don t know all the 260 names
of your women s husbands

who cries over nothing
joo hwan
did i
really talk too much 
my friend 
i d like for you
to find that criminal
among people you re close to
congratulations
your case was automatically
dismissed yesterday
but remember this by all means
open quote
like a gazelle from the
hand of the hunter   
like a bird from the
snare of the fowler   
free yourself
close quote who are you 
what about you you rotten bastard 
i made up my mind when i was imprisoned
that i won t trust anyone if i get out
if there s anyone who i find suspicious
then i ll create a secret that
person and i will only know
that id  monster  is a trap
that i made to catch you
you lead a stranger to your
place who the hell are you 
who s evergreen 
i tracked down that evergreen
id and found the owner s name
ready to jot it down 
it s su daeoh  that s
a strange rare surname
address  in eungam
saewoon apartments building 7  room 407
i m not doing fine within
life in a bigger prison   
 evergreen 
 who are you  
you meant to ask this  right 
you must find out on your
own come on  it s a game
first  who  then  why 
if you figure it out come see me anytime
i ll raise your score
you have until july 5th
oh no  only five days left
too short 
hang in there if you succeed
i ll kill myself and not mido
that s right  mido
i m going to kill every woman
you love until you die
well  you re notorious
for not protecting your women
wow  you re strong mr  monster
yes  you are the very monster i created
but you won t find out
the  why   if you do this
15 years of being curious
would go to waste so
is that okay with you 
sit down there
oh  the famous teeth torture
you won t have enough time to torture me
since i have a weak heart i
have a pacemaker in my chest
when it was put in
know what i asked the doctor 
doctor hopkins give me a remote control
to turn that motor off
pardon  why 
so that i can kill
myself easily at anytime
i ll give you  100 000 more
oh  what will you do 
you want to kill me right away
but you won t know
why you were imprisoned
you want to torture me but
i say i ll kill myself first
do you seek revenge or
do you find the truth 
oh  you re in a tough spot
i ve been watching over you for 15 years
i faired well thanks to you
i wasn t bored or lonely
seeking revenge is the best
cure for someone who got hurt
try it
the loss of 15 years the pain of losing
your wife and child
you can forget all this
once again revenge is
good for your health
but    what happens after
you ve revenged yourself 
i bet that hidden pain will
probably come back again
are you there  daesu 
daesu 
long time no see
hasn t she been tied up for too long 
i think you also left the door open
please save me
but i could die first
rudolph the red nosed reindeer

they have an imagination
so do not imagine
you ll become brave as hell
now  here comes the real thing
