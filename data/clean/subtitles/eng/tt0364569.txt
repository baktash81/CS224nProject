kim jahyuns body was found
deeply stabbed in the neck
seeing that it was a cold blooded murder
with nothing valuable stolen
police suspect that the
motive was out of hatred
her husband who disappeared
a year ago is a prime suspect
according to witnesses
her husband oh daesu
drank often causing
trouble with his wife
and neighbors said
they fought frequently
blood samples found at the scene
matched oh daesus
fingerprints found on a cup
also matched oh daesus
it was confirmed by sources that
oh daesu visited his wife recently
the stolen family album
also backs their theories
after three years
many wrinkles have formed on his face
ah that is around 8
million wons 8 million wons
for a knife 8 million wons
of course for a sushi master
you need the best tools
if you stand aimlessly
at a phone booth on a rainy day
and meet a man whose face is
covered by a violet umbrella
id suggest that you get close to the tv
the television is both
a clock and calendar
its your school home
church friend
and lover
but
but
my lovers song
is too short
this morning around 730 the top 50m of
the sungsoo bridge in seoul
suddenly collapsed in the middle
i wrote down all the people
whom i fought with bothered and hurt
this was both my prison journal
and autobiography of my evil deeds
i thought i had lived an average life
but ive sinned too much
all i thought about at that moment
was that the guy next door
probably ate with one chopstick
but
but
who wouldve imprisoned me
was it yoo heung sam
lee so young or kang changsuk
whoever it was just wait
wait a bit more
ill rip your whole body apart
and no one will be able
to find your body anywhere
because im going to chew it all down
one line for one year
i have to sew six lines
at first
i guess next year will be easier
the more the tattoos
the shorter the chopstick
the shorter the chopstick the
bigger the walls hole gets
anyway
time passes well

my friend
id like for you
to find that criminal
among people youre close to
congratulations
your case was automatically
dismissed yesterday
but remember this by all means
open quote
like a gazelle from the
hand of the hunter
like a bird from the
snare of the fowler
free yourself
close quote who are you
what about you you rotten bastard
i made up my mind when i was imprisoned
that i wont trust anyone if i get out
if theres anyone who i find suspicious
then ill create a secret that
person and i will only know
that id monster is a trap
that i made to catch you
you lead a stranger to your
place who the hell are you
whos evergreen
i tracked down that evergreen
id and found the owners name
ready to jot it down
its su daeoh thats
a strange rare surname
address in eungam
saewoon apartments building 7 room 407
im not doing fine within
life in a bigger prison
evergreen
who are you
you meant to ask this right
you must find out on your
own come on its a game
first who then why
if you figure it out come see me anytime
ill raise your score
you have until july 5th
oh no only five days left
too short
hang in there if you succeed
ill kill myself and not mido
thats right mido
im going to kill every woman
you love until you die
well youre notorious
for not protecting your women
wow youre strong mr monster
yes you are the very monster i created
but you wont find out
the why if you do this
15 years of being curious
would go to waste so
is that okay with you
sit down there
oh the famous teeth torture
you wont have enough time to torture me
since i have a weak heart i
have a pacemaker in my chest
when it was put in
know what i asked the doctor
doctor hopkins give me a remote control
to turn that motor off
pardon why
so that i can kill
myself easily at anytime
ill give you 100000 more
oh what will you do
you want to kill me right away
but you wont know
why you were imprisoned
you want to torture me but
i say ill kill myself first
do you seek revenge or
do you find the truth
oh youre in a tough spot
ive been watching over you for 15 years
i faired well thanks to you
i wasnt bored or lonely
seeking revenge is the best
cure for someone who got hurt
try it
the loss of 15 years the pain of losing
your wife and child
you can forget all this
once again revenge is
good for your health
but what happens after
youve revenged yourself
i bet that hidden pain will
probably come back again
are you there daesu
daesu
long time no see
hasnt she been tied up for too long
i think you also left the door open
please save me
but i could die first
rudolph the red nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose
this dentist is really good
dont move
dont move
whats with you
now
here we go
you see
they say that people
shrivel up because
they have an imagination
so do not imagine
youll become brave as hell
now here comes the real thing
