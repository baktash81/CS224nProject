but i ll call you
when we get settled  ok 
when i have a better
indication of what s going on 
mommy 
jellybean 
daddy and i have
a last minute business trip   
so  rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days 
no  i don t want you to go 
it s gonna be so boring 
i won t be able to keep my   
eyes   
goodbye  sweetheart 
alright  we ll see you soon 
ok 
janet  we got to go 
i wish we could have
put down our bags 
tucked you back into your bed 
but too many lives were at stake 
oh  my god 
they ve already launched 
we have to stop it 
come on 
to disarm the missile 
we had to get inside it 
but the plating was too thick 
the only way in was to shrink
between the molecules 
i can t get through 
hank 
we both knew
that if you go that small   
there is no coming back 
it should have been me 
but my regulator was damaged 
your mother s wasn t 
tell hope i love her 
she turned it off 
janet  no 
she went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb 
your mother saved
thousands of lives that day 
knowing she d be lost
in the quantum realm 
alone 
afraid 
gone forever 
telling you that she wasn t
coming home 
was the hardest thing
that i ever had to do 
but then scott showed up 
or should i say  broke into our house 
and when he went
to the quantum realm   
and came back 
everything changed 
i started to wonder 
could your mother still be alive 
so  i dusted off some old plans 
dad  what are you saying 
i think it s possible to bring her back 
ok  we re in 
this place is a maze 
where s that map 
we re definitely close 
you ready 
i m ready  daddy 
are you sure 
because once we re inside 
you show any hesitation or fear 
we re done 
i eat fear for breakfast 
that is super cool 
come on 
look  it s anton 
he ll show us the way 
anton  which way do we go 
anton  which way do we go 
thanks  anton 
look  the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility 
oh no  lasers 
i think i got lased 
the secret vault 
tell me you brought the contact lens 
yup 
perfect  right there 
there  it s the micro treasure 
my trophy 
it looks like treasure 
oh it is to me 
i want to take it to show and tell 
oh no  you can t do that 
you can t 
it never leaves the house 
it s too important 
this is the best birthday
present you ever got me 
i m so touched you think i m
the world s greatest grandma 
it was the only one they had 
it makes me want
to knit you a sweater 
oh no  the fuzz 
hey scotty 
i was looking at the schematics
for the karapetyan buildings 
and i think we have way too many
security cameras  don t we 
no  no  not at all 
i mean  because it s a lot
of security cameras 
i know what he needs 
who s the security expert
in our business 
you are  but i m running
the company  right 
and if we overquote him
he s gonna go somewhere else 
i mean  we got to land this bird 
he aingt going anywhere 
and the expression is land this fish 
no  it s land the bird 
just like you land the plane 
you got to land the plane
to be in business 
i know it s silly to get hung up on
these kinds of things  but i do 
how am i gonna land a fish 
it can t walk 
and if it swam up on shore 
and it battled a hawk 
who s gonna win 
you ve really turned me around
on this thing 
it s ok 
we re gonna land karapetyan 
now  if you just excuse me 
i m in the middle of trying to
steal something with my daughter 
i m gonna go recheck it 
to the escape ant 
let s bounce
before the po po come back 
the po po 
how do you even know that 
let s fly  antoinette 
let s fly 
crash landing 
i wish we could shrink for real 
that is pretty cool 
hey  i m headed to the office  scotty 
and sorry about freaking out earlier 
you know 
but i feel like i m way better 
my heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff 
and my hands are shaking 
but i think it s unrelated  you know 
it s gonna be great  luis 
you got nothing to worry about 
yeah  yeah  i m the boss 
i m the boss 
i m the boss 
yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah 
daddy 
come on 
i ve got three days left 
why would i try to escape 
sorry scott  but rules are rules 
you trip the perimeter alarm 
we search the place 
keel to stern  soup to nuts 
thank you 
it was an accident 
my foot went through the fence 
our flying ant crashed 
hey  you try and entertain
a 10 year old 
you can t leave the house 
you know the lengths
that i ve gone to 
close up magic 
i learned that 
why can t you just leave
my daddy alone 
cassie 
this must all seem like a bunch
of confusing grown up stuff to you 
well  think of it this way 
your school has rules  right 
like  you can t draw on the walls 
well  your daddy went to germany
and drew on the walls
with captain america 
and that was a violation of article 16 
paragraph three
of the sokovia accords 
now  as a part of his joint plea
deal with homeland security
and the german government 
he was allowed to return to the u s
provided he serve two years
under house arrest
followed by three years of probation 
and avoid any unauthorized
activities  technology 
or contact with any former
associates who were 
or currently are in violation
of said accords 
or any related statutes 
ok sweetie 
you re really great with kids 
thanks 
i m also a youth pastor 
anyway  not to be a johnny ask a lot 
but you haven t had any contact
with hank pym or hope van dyne 
have you 
no 
you sure 
because it s only a matter
of time before we get them 
it was their tech 
so they violated the accords  too 
and associating with them
breaks your deal 
and  i don t need to remind you that 
any violation of your agreement
means 20 years in prison 
minimum 
i haven t talked to hank
or hope in forever 
they hate his guts 
thanks  peanut 
how d you do it  scott 
do what 
the card trick 
seriously 
oh my god 
you people can t just show up here
whenever you want
and search the place 
actually  they can 
you need a warrant 
actually  they don t 
really 
did you pack your soccer shoes 
yeah 
alright 
next time i see you
will be on the outside 
alright 
get on the inside of this 
hey  three days  seriously
i m proud of you  bud 
thank you 
you know what 
give me another one 
me too  gosh 
freedom 
new business 
i am sensing greatness 
i had a fun weekend  daddy 
me too  peanut 
but just wait till next weekend 
once i m outta here you and i
are gonna go paint this town red 
we ll have so much ice cream 
we ll never stop puking 
you re getting good at that 
how d you do that 
bye  daddy 
bye 
bye 
bye 
three days 
easy peasy 
snap your fingers 
that gets them to look over there 
and that is misdirection 
  we had a dream  
  we d go traveling together  
  we d spread a little loving  
  then we d keep moving on  
easy peasy 
where are you 
everything that you know
lost
in the quantum realm 
what 
i m gonna find you  jellybean 
i found you 
you always find me  mommy 
what the hell 
hey  hank 
it s been a while 
i don t even know if this is your number   
anymore 
and i m probably the last person
you wanna hear from  but   
i just had a really weird dream 
and i know that doesn t   
sound like an emergency
or anything but   
it just felt   
very real 
i was back in the quantum realm and   
i   
think i saw your wife 
and then i was your wife 
i mean  not in a weird way or anything 
you know 
hearing this out loud  i m thinking   
it s not an emergency 
i m sorry to bother you 
i m sorry for a lot of things 
that means  one tiny atom
in my fingernail
could be one  little  tiny universe 
hope 
is this another dream 
do you think it was a dream
or is it possible
that you really saw
my mom down there 
i m not sure 
i can t be here 
i can t be here 
i m under house arrest 
they won t open while
the system s engaged  scott 
you have to take me home 
they could show up any second 
relax  as far as your nanny cops
know you re still at home 
scotty 
he s programmed
to replicate your daily routine 
nine hours in bed 
five hours in front of the tv 
two hours in the bathroom 
whatever that s about 
that s totally inaccurate 
and how do you know
about my daily routine 
are you spying on me 
we keep tabs on all
security threats  alright 
and so far the biggest one
we ve had is you 
i m sorry about germany 
they just showed up 
they said  it was a matter
of national security 
that cap needed help  so
cap 
tain america  captain 
cap 
it s what we call him 
if you re a friend 
i m not saying i m a friend of
a little  i know him 
he s nice  whatever 
i m sorry  alright 
i  i didn t think i d get caught 
you didn t think about a lot of things 
how s hank 
we re still running 
the house is gone  so is our freedom 
how do you think he is 
i m sorry  i know you re mad 
i m not looking for an apology  scott 
the only reason
why we re even talking is 
because we need what s in your head 
is this where you re living 
if   
you need help or money
or something  maybe i can
we re fine 
hey  hank 
look  i just wanna   
save it 
can we start 
yeah 
so  while you were relaxing at home 
we were building this 
it s a tunnel 
to the quantum realm 
to my mom 
we think she might still be down there 
we just don t know where 
what 
if we can pinpoint my mom s location 
then the pod can take me down
to get her 
you built all this
and you don t even know
if she s alive 
it s called a hypothesis 
last night  we powered up
the tunnel for the first time 
it was overloaded and it shut down 
but for a split second 
the doorway to the quantum realm 
was opened 
and 
and five minutes later you called 
talking about mom 
we think when you were down there 
you may have entangled with her 
hank  i would never do that 
i respect you too much 
quantum entanglement  scott 
we think she might have put some
kind of a message in your head 
hopefully a location 
and opening the tunnel triggered it 
your mom put a message in my head 
come on 
that s insane 
no  scott 
insane 
is going to germany without telling us 
and fighting the avengers 
just tell me you weren t lying
about the suit you took 
tell me you really destroyed it 
i did  i destroyed it  i swear 
i can t believe you destroyed my suit 
that was my life s work 
what was i supposed to do 
you were supposed to not
take my suit 
i m sorry  hank 
i m sorry i took the suit 
i m sorry that i called last night 
i  i   i don t remember
seeing janet down there 
i wish that i did 
i just had a dream about her
playing hide and seek with a little girl 
what 
you    i had a dream 
she was playing
hide and seek with a   
little   
girl  cassie and i do it all the time 
doesn t mean anything 
but was it cassie in the dream 
no 
where was she hiding 
what 
the little girl 
where was she hiding 
was it in a wardrobe 
no  it was in a tall dresser 
you mean a wardrobe 
is that what that s called 
what color was it 
red 
were there horses on it 
boy 
it s where i hid
every time that we played 
it doesn t sound like
you really got the gist of the game 
she s alive 
i knew it 
i knew it 
we need to get that part 
ok 
the sooner we get the tunnel working
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head 
does burch have it 
yeah  let s go 
what part 
who s burch 
wait  what s happening 
we need a component to stop
the tunnel from overloading again 
i grabbed your clothes 
you might want to change 
look  i d really like to help you
but if i m not at home when they
come to take off my ankle monitor
then i m going away forever 
once we get the component
and power up the tunnel
we ll get the message 
and have you home by lunch 
we have to hurry 
the entanglement won t last 
you owe us 
alright  fine 
but can i just wait inside 
because i m not supposed
to be out here 
let s go 
we good 
yeah 
i ll be right back 
can i have one of these 
no 
susan 
welcome to oui 
sonny 
oui is french for yes 
as in yes to farm to table 
yes to locally sourced 
and yes to planet before profit 
well  let s hope it also means yes
to do you have the component
i ordered 
you know  i have always loved
your sense of humor  susan 
have a seat 
no  i m good  thank you 
who is this guy 
sonny burch 
he traffics in black market technology 
he s been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel 
could i just have one
no 
you know  i have   
a special friend at the fbi 
and i say special because   
well he tells me things
that i didn t previously know 
for example   
your name isn t susan 
it s hope van dyne 
and your unseen associate 
that s your father  hank pym 
that s not good  hank 
no shit 
what do you want 
relationships are built on trust  hope 
and i want our relationship
to have a strong foundation 
our relationship 
my business landscape
has been shifting  hope 
hell  s h i e i d  and hydra don t even
exist anymore but now  hank pym
hank pym is a real opportunity 
do you have a point 
you think that i don t know
what you ve been building 
with all this 
quantum technology 
now  you can forget nanotech  forget   
ai  forget cryptocurrency 
quantum energy is the future 
it s the next gold rush 
is that so 
i want in  hope 
so  as a gesture of good will 
i have taken the liberty 
of arranging some buyers
for your lab 
starting bid 
one billion dollars 
thank you  sonny really 
but my father and i have something
slightly more pressing
than starting a business 
so i ll just take
the component as arranged 
my buyers don t take no
for an answer 
so  we are either in business together 
or we aren t in business together 
then i guess we aren t 
you can go 
but i m afraid your money s
gonna have to remain 
let s call it compensation
for my injured feelings 
listen  sonny 
this is gonna be
so much easier on everybody
if you just give me that component 
darling  the only thing
you re taking from here 
is my heart 
but it will mend in time 
ok 
so  now what 
you ll see 
she said her and her daddy
had something pressing 
i want to know what it is
because if they re not working
with us 
they re working with somebody 
so find out 
i want some names
hold on  you gave her wings 
get her 
not my turn of the century chandelier 
stop firing 
stop 
alright  take this  go 
go  go  go  go  go 
go 
wings and blasters 
so i take it you didn t have
that tech available for me 
no  i did 
it was a pleasure doing
business with you  sonny 
our business isn t finished yet  hope 
i can assure you of that 
what in the hell is that 
dad  are you seeing this 
hope  get out of there 
i got to do something 
wait 
it is still a work in progress 
you taught me that kick 
remember 
yeah  great form 
those were the days 
whatever happened to us 
not the time  scott 
damn it  where d it go 
i ve lost it 
i m not seeing anything
on the ant cams 
try looking
dad 
give me that 
now 
are you ok 
no 
he got the lab 
no 
come on 
what was that 
i don t know 
but we need to find somewhere
to regroup
and figure out where the lab is 
so  where to now 
how about my house 
i m supposed to be there anyway 
and woo could walk in any second 
exactly why we re not going
to your house 
what about your house 
sorry 
well  there is one place i can think of 
no 
no  no  no  no 
no 
dr  pym 
like  like who would have thought that 
once again 
in your hour of need that 
you would turn to us  you know 
not me 
help yourself 
hey  what s up with the fancy pastry 
we got to keep the food budget down 
well  what are we supposed
to have for breakfast 
the oatmeal packets 
oatmeal packets 
it s insult 
why is it an insult 
because it tastes like sand 
you know why 
it s because it s organic 
it s not organic  it s sand 
it s the most important meal
of the day 
hey you know what 
you can get creative with it 
break teeth 
put a little brown sugar on it 
you can put some cinnamon 
put a little honey 
whatever you want
guys  guys  guys  guys  guys 
come on  man 
we got bigger fish to fry 
is that my desk 
yeah 
what 
why do i have such a small desk 
because you weren t there
when we were choosing desks 
you snooze  you lose 
well  i was under house arrest 
yeah 
you know what  this isn t even a desk 
this is garbage 
you found this outside
amongst garbage 
i got it at a rummage sale 
so  you save money on my desk 
guys 
hope  please 
we need to focus  alright 
we got to find that lab already 
jeez 
you know what  i heard stories 
like what happened to you 
like this crazy  creepy cat 
who walks through walls and stuff 
like  like a ghost 
like baba yaga 
baba yaga  the witch 
they tell stories to children
to frighten them 
you know baba yaga 
whoever stole it 
we need to find it 
you don t find someone like that 
they find you 
like baba yaga 
dr  pym  you re the smartest
genius i know 
didn t you put some kind
of lojack on your lab 
because if you didn t 
we have a variety of affordable options 
of course i did  luis 
it was disabled 
whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing 
they also looked like
they were phasing 
phasing 
quantum phasing 
when an object moves
through different states of matter 
yeah  that s what i was thinking 
the lab emits radiation 
can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it 
that could work yes  but all
my equipment is in the lab 
where else can
we find that equipment 
well  there is one person 
bill foster 
great 
who s bill foster 
he s an old colleague of
my dad s  from s h i e i d 
they had a falling out years ago 
you seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people 
it s probably just a waste of time 
hey  i m risking everything
by being here 
don t you think we should check 
we need to find out who took the lab 
guys  it s not a good idea
to be out in the open like this 
relax  no one s gonna recognize us 
what  because of hats and sunglasses 
that s not a disguise  hank 
we look like ourselves
at a baseball game 
in an isolated system 
particles co exist 
in a stable phase relationship 
if the system is interfered with 
that stability becomes chaos 
unpredictable 
dangerous 
beautiful 
isolated completely a quantum system
would revert back
to separate states of matter
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment 
in other words 
the object in question would be
both in and out of phase 
with multiple parallel realities 
speaking of being out of phase
with reality 
i am noticing an unusually high number
of glazed eyes out there among you 
so  why don t we call it
a few minutes early 
that ll be enough for today 
thank you  ladies
and gentlemen  you may go 
it s incredible 
you re linked to janet 
it s quantum entanglement 
between the quantum states of
posner molecules in your brains 
yeah  that s what i was thinking 
do you guys just put the word
quantum in front of everything 
doctor  we need to find our lab 
hope  i d love to help you but
i don t have anything like the
equipment you re describing 
i told you this is a waste of time 
come on  let s go 
don t condescend  hank 
you re the one
who s on the run from the fbi 
all because you had to grow to a size
that finally fit your ego 
that wasn t me in germany 
it was this idiot 
really 
going that big 
it must ve been exhausting 
i slept for three days straight 
you have no idea 
actually  i do 
back in the day i was 
hank s partner
on a project called goliath 
excuse me 
you were my partner 
the only thing more tiring
than going that big 
is putting up with hank s bullshit 
right
i don t know 
how big did you get 
my record 
21 feet 
not bad 
you 
i don t
no  really  i m curious 
65 feet 
yeah 
huge 
65 
if you two are finished comparing sizes
we need to figure out
a way to track down 
the lab 
and the great hank pym hasn t
figured that one out yet 
strange 
you had all the answers
back in the day 
that s why i left the project 
left 
i fired you 
best decision i ever made 
hank was a terrible partner 
temperamental 
stubborn  impatient 
sooner or later 
he just pushed everyone away 
just the mediocrities 
janet was the only one
who could endure him
and chose to stick it out 
watch it  bill 
she paid the price  though didn t she 
you son of a bitch 
i didn t come here
to listen to you two squabble 
i m trying to save my mother 
now  which office would you say 
it s woo 
someone must have seen me 
relax  if this is about you 
they d be in your house by now 
what are you  15 
come on 
we got to go right now 
wait 
you might be able
to improvise that tracker 
if you modify the diffraction units
on one of your regulators 
that could work 
i don t know what that means 
thank you 
thank you 
but doctor 
campus police says
they id d both pym and van dyne 
i don t know what to tell you  agent 
i haven t talked to hank in 30 years 
i can assure you i m the last person
he would want to visit 
come on  you expect us to   
hey  hey 
why is that 
simple 
we hate each other s guts 
so i m a terrible partner 
foster  he hasn t had one good idea
in his unremarkable career 
but his idea about
the diffractors could work  right 
fine  one decent idea 
except  i eliminated the diffractors
when i upgraded the suits 
so  if we had an old suit 
we might be able
to track down the lab 
yes  but we don t 
what if we did 
what do you mean 
i mean   
life s funny 
oh my god 
you didn t destroy the suit 
what 
well  it was your life s work  hank 
i couldn t destroy that 
before i turned myself in 
i shrunk it down and mailed it to luis 
you sent my suit through the mail 
hey  the postal service is very reliable 
you know 
they do tracking numbers now 
like ups 
where is it 
it s in a very safe place  alright 
don t worry 
what  the trophy 
no  it s not here 
what do you mean it s not there 
where could it be 
i looked everywhere 
it s not here 
hey  get away from the plant 
but i put it back after cassie and i   
show and tell 
scotty 
no  stop 
well  the good news is
i know where it is 
whenever you go back to school
isn t everything supposed
to look so much smaller 
this place seems huge 
what is it 
it s the new regulator 
hank  what s going on with this suit 
how much of a work
in progress is this 
no  no  no 
what are you  laughing 
please  could you just
ok  ok 
what do you see 
the sizing coils are malfunctioning 
just let me
sorry 
it s alright 
ok 
alright 
try that 
sorry 
what 
awesome 
if only cap could see you now 
hilarious 
what are we gonna do 
hey 
where s your hall pass 
hey  i m talking to you 
hey 
hey 
you can do it 
you almost got it 
peanut 
ok  let s go 
hiya champ  how was school today 
alright  get your jokes out now 
can you fix the suit 
so cranky 
you want a juice box
and some string cheese 
do you really have that 
let s see if foster was right 
this has got to be the lab 
let s go get it 
yeah 
this seems right 
look at us 
teaming up twice in one day 
makes you think 
about what 
germany 
what do you mean 
we were working together 
training together and   
other stuffing together 
if i had asked you 
would you have come 
i guess we ll never know 
but i do know one thing 
what 
if i had  you d have never been caught 
hey  scott 
you think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter
long enough to get my lab 
yes  sir 
thank you 
ok  you re transmitting 
what took you so long 
sorry  i had to come
up with a name for my ant 
i m thinking ulysses s  gr ant 
you like it 
hilarious 
i m not getting anything
on the monitors 
some kind of   
electronic disturbance 
be careful 
you know me  hank 
i m always care   
it s ok 
it s just the suit 
how do you know 
look 
that s ghost 
what is she doing 
do you think that suit is how she
goes through walls and stuff 
let s just get outta here
before she wakes up 
hope  look 
there s the lab 
now  we re sure
this is our shrunken building
and not somebody else s  right 
just take it  scott 
come on  we got to be fast 
i ll get it 
shit
hope  hope  hank 
guys 
i don t think they can hear you 
hi 
i m ava 
scott 
so   
you don t need the suit to   
you know   
go through things 
no 
it just
helps me control it 
and the pain 
supposedly 
you re not gonna reach into my chest
and crush my heart  are you 
you re funny 
i m not gonna hurt you  scott 
unless i have to 
i need   
what s in your head 
let s wake up the rest of the gang
and get this over with  shall we 
get up 
come on 
dad 
don t ever touch him again 
now  now  hope 
i think i m being rather gentle with
your father  all things considered 
what the hell are you talking about 
another casualty of hank pym s ego 
bill 
what have you done 
it s what you ve done  dr  pym 
you re with her 
man  i thought you were cool 
what the hell is going on here 
i doubt hank has
ever mentioned my father 
why would he 
elihas starr 
they were colleagues at s h i e i d 
quantum research 
until my father dare disagree
with the great hank pym 
you had him fired 
and discredited for good measure 
my father tried to continue
his research on his own 
desperate to restore his name 
so he took risks 
no  no  no 
too many 
until something went wrong 
he told us to run 
elihas  what s happening 
just go  go 
daddy  daddy 
i could tell he was scared 
daddy 
ava  no 
i didn t want him to be alone 
no  no 
when i woke up 
my parents were dead 
i wasn t so lucky 
they call it molecular disequilibrium 
a rather dull name  i think 
doesn t quite do justice
to what it means 
every cell in my body is torn apart
and stitched back together 
over and over 
every day 
i was still at s h i e i d 
when i got the call about a   
quantum anomaly in argentina 
hello  ava 
my name s bill 
i was a friend of your father s 
i brought you something 
it s alright 
try again 
that s it 
dr  foster did his best
to keep me safe 
but others at s h i e i d 
saw an opportunity in my affliction 
they built me a containment suit 
so i could control my phasing 
and trained me to be
a stealth operative 
they weaponized me 
i stole for them 
spied for them 
killed for them 
and in exchange for my soul 
they were going to cure me 
they lied 
when s h i e i d  collapsed 
i took ava in 
i built the chamber to slow her decay 
but her condition was progressive 
i didn t know how to cure it 
she wanted to kill you hank 
but i told her no 
and that she should watch
you instead 
and sure enough 
she discovered that you
were building the tunnel 
then  she told me about lang 
and the message from janet
inside his head 
that s when i   
christ s sake 
that s me  i m sorry 
look  can you tell me
who s texting me 
cassie  911 
that s my daughter 
i need to text her back 
no  that s not happening 
what  it s 911 
that means it s an emergency 
you re not making
demands here  lang 
you re not appreciating
the gravity of the   
ok  look  she s trying
to video chat me now 
something might be wrong 
let me talk to her  please 
cassie  are you ok 
what s the emergency 
i can t find my soccer shoes 
what 
i have a game tomorrow 
hey scott  i know that they re there 
can you just walk the phone
around the house 
no  i can t do that right now 
why not 
because i m sick 
hey  can you just maybe look around
later then and call me back 
please  thank you 
bye  daddy 
bye  peanut 
feel better 
feel better  buddy 
i m sorry 
it said emergency 
ava  i want to help you 
she doesn t need your help 
i know how to save her 
really  how 
janet 
for the last 30 years  she s been
down there absorbing quantum energy 
we can extract that energy 
we can use it to repair
ava s molecular structure
extract it 
yes 
are you insane 
that would rip janet apart 
you don t know that 
i m gonna fire up your tunnel 
when janet s location pops into
lang s head  he s gonna give it to me
or i m gonna turn him over to the fbi 
what 
you are gonna stay here 
just in case i need your help 
like hell i would help you 
you ll do whatever i say 
you re gonna kill janet 
i d be more worried about yourself  hank 
goddamn it  bill 
dad 
calm down  hank 
so help me god 
the pills 
it s his heart 
he needs his pills 
please  dr  foster 
they re in the tin  please 
he could die 
come on 
help him 
dad  just hang on  alright 
just keep breathing 
stay calm 
help him  man  come on 
the altoid tin 
wait 
thanks  guys 
hank 
bill is filling that girl s head with lies 
elihas starr was a traitor 
he stole my plans 
now  bring it down 
alright  lock it in 
no  no  no 
the bolt is on the other side 
tighten that one down 
then bring it down one notch 
good job 
it ll work 
foster  he could have fried
the entire system 
look  we ll adjust the relays
while you go reprogram
the settings  alright 
it s going to be fine 
so  this is it 
yeah 
you d think with all this time
to prepare i d be more ready 
going subatomic isn t
something you can prepare for 
it kind of melts your mind 
i mean seeing my mom again 
what if she s a completely
different person 
yeah  like  george washington 
i m serious  scott 
or george jefferson 
what if she s forgotten about me 
when i was in prison 
the only thing that got me
through was cassie 
i could have been locked up
for 100 years 
i never would have forgotten her 
i know your mom
is counting the minutes
until she can see you again 
thank you 
hey 
we got a big problem 
you forgot the motion sensor lights
on the back of the building 
no 
and they re on the proposal 
and karapetyan
asked for them specifically 
yeah  look  it s been a little crazy 
look  maybe i could stop
by tomorrow  take a look at it 
no  no  no  no  no 
the meeting is first thing
in the morning 
you got to come right now and fix it 
i can t  i wish i could  but i can t leave 
you know what  i m coming to you 
i ll just bring the plans 
they re on the laptop 
and you can fix them there 
just tell me where you are  ok 
it s complicated 
what do you mean it s complicated 
as you can see  sir 
this system is state of the art 
security of tomorrow  today 
that s so good 
and i love the lean in  bro 
keep practicing 
hey  i just got to drive up to scotty s 
so we can fix the plans 
but don t worry  i ll be back
in plenty of time 
as you can see 
tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning 
down to the undercarriage  baby 
you sprung for
the undercarriage wash 
well  you said get the works 
that s a scam  bro 
we live in california  not minnesota 
he s right 
the undercarriage wash 
that s for cleaning off road salt 
laid down in our more
snow laden sister states 
who are you and why do you know
so much about car wash protocol 
well  my name is sonny burch 
and i do my research  luis 
to wit  i have learned
from a friend of mine 
at the fbi that you are
a known associate of scott lang 
a known associate of hank pym 
who i ve also learned 
has a portable shrinking laboratory 
filled with all kinds of juicy tech 
and you re gonna tell me where it is 
well  i hate to break it to you but   
i don t know what you re talking about 
well  i sense a resistance in you  luis 
and i have promised results
to some dangerous people 
so  i m gonna introduce you 
to my good friend  uzman 
now 
uzman is a master 
at extracting information from the
unwilling through psychoactive means 
is that truth serum 
there s no such thing as truth serum 
that s just nonsense from tv 
well  what is it then 
it s a little concoction 
that he s been perfecting
since his days with the s i s 
it makes you suggestible
and highly responsive 
well  dude  that s truth serum 
no  it s not 
no offensing 
but they sound like truth serum to me 
right 
it s not a truth serum 
ok  hey  i believe you 
it s not a truth serum 
i mean  if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks
the truth serum 
well  i have a lot of allergies so   
you might wanna think about that 
we ve got to get that lab back 
what 
the chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore 
how long have i got 
a couple of weeks  maybe 
well  then we ll make them
bring the lab back 
how 
lang  he has a daughter  right 
you can t mean that 
ava 
i tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there
but i won t be a part of anything like that 
you re not the one who s about
to fade away into nothing  bill 
i am 
you said you could fix me 
you promised 
i know  i will 
but not like that 
you lay one finger on that little girl   
i won t help you 
and we re done 
fine 
there are other options 
you know what  you re right 
this isn t truth serum 
because i don t feel anything 
that was a lie 
i do feel something 
this is truth serum 
there s no such thing 
ok 
ok  ok 
now  i m gonna make this
real easy for you  luis 
ok 
where is scott lang 
well see  that s complicated 
because when i first met scotty 
he was in a bad place 
and i m not talking about cell block d 
his wife had just filed for divorce 
and i was like damn  homie 
she dumped you when you re on lockup 
and he was like  yeah i know 
i thought i was gonna be
with her forever  
but now i m all alone 
and i was like  damn homie 
you know what 
you got to chin up 
because you ll find a new partner 
but you know what  i m luis 
and he says  you know what 
i m scotty and we re gonna be
best friends 
ok  hold on  hold on 
i like a good story
as much as the next person
but what in the hell
does this have to do
with where scott lang is 
i m getting there 
i m getting there 
you put a dime in him 
you got to let the whole song play out 
he like human jukebox 
my abuelita had a jukebox
in the restaurant 
yeah  only played morrissey 
and if anybody ever complained 
she d be like 
oh   no te gusta moz 
you know chicanos 
we call him moz 
then adios 
what can i say  we relate to his
melancholy ballads  you know 
lang 
right  right  right  right  right 
so anyway  scotty gets out of jail 
and he starts working for hank 
that s when he met hope 
and hope s all like 
i want nothing to do with you 
look at my hairdo  i m all business 
and then scotty s like 
you know what  girl 
my heart is all broken 
and i ll probably never find love again 
but damn if i want to kiss you 
but then you fast forward and
they re all into each other  right 
and then scotty s  like 
you know what 
i can t tell you this
but i m gonna go trash an
airport with captain america 
and then she said  i can t
believe you split like that 
smell you later  dummy 
so  scotty goes on house arrest 
and he won t admit it 
but his heart is all like 
damn  i thought hope coulda been
my new true partner  but i blew it 
but fate brought them back together 
and then hope s heart is all
i m worried that i can t trust him
and he s gonna screw up
again  and ruin everything 
and then my heart is all like 
that fancy raspberry filling
represents the company s red
and we re days away from
going out of business 
out of business 
days away 
damn truth serum 
and you know 
i was trying to protect you guys 
i swear to god 
and you know  i was trying to be
a good boss but we re broke 
and the karapetyan s our last hope 
and if we don t show up  we re done 
that s terrible bossing 
damn  bro 
that s on me  that s on me 
hey 
enough 
i m gonna ask you one more time 
where is scott lang 
i ve been trying to tell you  he s in
a tricky spot  emotionally speaking 
emotionally speaking 
well  where is scott lang 
literally speaking 
the woods 
the woods 
baba yaga 
what do you mean  the woods 
the muir woods  the second fire road
off the panoramic highway 
for god s sake 
  baba yaga  come at night  
  little children  sleepy tight  
damn it 
if that freak gets pym s tech
i m never gonna see it 
so  what do we do now 
it s easier to steal it from the feds
than from the boogeyman 
hey  it s me 
how d you like to get a promotion 
i got the location on pym 
van dyne and lang 
but you gonna have
to take them down now 
because they aingt gonna be
there for long 
and when you do 
you gonna get me that lab 
understood 
good news  gentlemen 
feds are gonna do
the hard work for us 
what are you looking at 
change my tires 
right 
sir 
can you knock 
sorry  sir 
but i just got a lead 
i love leads 
system s in the green 
priming the coils 
full charge 
as soon as the tunnel s open
let us know if you get anything
that could be a part of her message 
yeah  yeah  i will 
ok  then 
here it goes 
we did it 
you got anything 
nothing 
well  just give it a minute 
because it could
no 
no  no  no  no 
what s happening 
it s shutting down 
maybe our vectors are off 
we ve gone over them a million
times  i know they re right 
then what else could it be 
i don t know 
scott  what are you doing 
scott  get away from that 
scott  you can t   
i m sorry  i don t know
how much time i have 
i need to fix the algorithm 
trust me  after 30 years down here 
i ve thought about it a lot 
janet 
hi  honey 
jellybean 
mom 
it s not the reunion i d imagined 
it s all so rushed 
you two have done such great work 
you just need a little   
nudge 
janet  how is this possible 
it wasn t a message you put
in scott s head 
it was an antenna 
clever girl 
i m so proud of you 
honey  tell us where you are 
tell us how to find you 
no  the probability fields
are too complex 
that s why i needed to talk to you 
you have to follow my voice 
of course 
like tracing a call back to its source 
i m tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies 
between point two and point nine 
i d narrow it to four and six 
that s too tight 
we could miss you 
look at us squabbling again 
fine  alright  between three and seven 
our first fight in decades 
and it s over just like that 
bullseye 
source lock 
it s you 
we got it 
you have to meet me
at these exact coordinates 
in the wasteland 
beyond the quantum void 
it s very dangerous 
especially on the human mind 
so be careful 
time and space work very
differently down here 
you have two hours 
after that  the probability fields will
shift and it ll be another century
before they align like this again 
we ll find you 
i know you will  jellybean 
nope 
nothing  i got nothing 
no sign of janet 
perfect 
how did we get up here 
alright  first you re gonna see
all kinds of lights 
and it s gonna get really trippy 
but then it s gonna turn
black and silent 
really silent 
scott  i ll be fine 
i m just saying
because i ve been down there 
yeah  so you ve mentioned 
sorry 
i have to take this 
hey  man  you coming 
no  i m not  but you know what 
ghost is 
and you know what  the feds 
they know where you are 
what 
i m sorry  i m sorry 
they gave me some truth serum 
and then all of a sudden
i started talking all honestly 
like  i hate the way
that you load the dishwasher 
i hate it  i hate it 
but you need to go home 
because the feds
are probably going there now 
and by the way  who puts the
plates on the top rack  ok 
they don t go there 
i feel like such a jerk 
you re gonna be really mad 
we got to go now 
what 
ghost knows where we are 
so does the fbi 
how 
i told luis where we are 
you what 
i told him to come here
so i could help him
with the karapetyan proposal 
oh  my god 
look  we need to land that account 
otherwise  we lose the business 
do you know hard it is for ex cons
to find work these days 
jesus  scott 
shit 
90 seconds to close the aperture 
you have to depolarize the coils first 
i know 
i m really sorry but the   
fbi is coming to my place so   
i have to go 
can i borrow the suit 
gyroscopic stabilizers 
powering on 
i m just gonna borrow the suit 
i ll come back 
just tell me where you ll be 
don t bother 
what 
we ll come and get the suit from you 
as soon as we ve found my mom 
hope
scott  just go 
scott 
daddy 
it s us  buddy 
we re here for cassie s shoes 
he must be resting 
honey  why don t you go upstairs
and look under your bed 
daddy  you upstairs 
daddy 
what the   
he really lives like a pig these days 
daddy 
spread out 
again 
you people have no shame 
the monitor says
that he s in the bathroom 
yeah  i m not buying it 
cassie  let the man get by 
but daddy s super sick 
i ll see about that 
he says he doesn t want
anyone else to get sick 
well  i ll take my chances sweetie 
he barfed  like a lot 
young lady  i m a federal agent 
i ve seen worse things than vomit 
like  a lot a lot 
yes 
forget it  move aside 
no 
what are you doing here 
scott 
sor    i m sorry  i m just really sick 
i told you 
excuse me 
sometimes you got to just get it out 
you know 
sorry 
i ll start the van 
you get the lab 
freeze 
you re surrounded 
don t move 
hank pym 
hope van dyne 
you re under arrest 
this is harassment 
actually  it s not 
what does the fbi even stand for
forever bothering individuals 
his monitor check out 
of course it does 
damn it 
looks like i just got fed
a bowl of malarkey 
we got them sir 
pym and van dyne are in custody 
seriously  yes 
i m sorry  scott 
they re your friends 
that s insensitive 
i just really needed a win  you know 
anyway  i ll be back later
for the official end of your sentence 
sorry for misjudging you  pal 
you should feel great about yourself 
what is it 
we have a man down 
and pym s lab is gone 
hey 
thanks for covering for me 
sure 
so   
how long have you been
ant man again 
not long 
it just sort of happened 
i m sorry for lying to you 
and i m sorry for risking everything 
daddy  it s ok 
it s not 
i do some dumb things 
and the people that i love
the most pay the price 
mainly you 
trying to help people isn t dumb 
well 
i screw it up just about every time 
so  maybe you just need
someone watching your back 
like a partner 
well  she s made it clear
that s about the last thing she wants 
who 
hope 
wait  who did you think 
me 
you 
don t laugh 
i d be a great partner 
peanut 
you would be awesome 
and if i let you 
i would be a terrible dad 
fine 
then have hope be your partner 
she s smart 
she reminds me of you 
you gonna go help her 
i think you should help her 
i wish i could but   
i don t know how i could help her
without hurting you 
you can do it 
you can do anything 
you are the world s greatest grandma 
agent woo will see you in an hour 
an hour 
we don t have an hour 
you got somewhere else to be 
now  that s my girl 
alright  what s our plan 
to shrink that wall 
it looks load bearing 
the ceiling could collapse 
then we run like hell 
now  i estimate 15 20 agents
on the floor 
roughly five times that
in the building at large 
they re all heavily armed 
not great odds 
you got any better ideas 
nope 
and i m not giving up on mom 
she d be so proud of you 
ok 
one 
two 
scott 
what re you two
just standing around for 
we got to go find that lab 
what about me 
perfect 
hurry up and get dressed 
we don t have much time 
ok  now what 
you re asking me 
get in 
hi 
hi 
excuse me  are we planning
on leaving soon
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other 
until they start shooting at us 
yeah 
hey  burch 
yeah 
yeah  they re out 
i m on my way 
her suit is missing and so is the van 
how could this happen 
i mean  what the dickens 
thank you 
you re welcome 
so  how do we find the lab 
after we lost it the first time 
i put on a new tracker   
of sorts 
that ll work 
is it ready or not 
we can begin
the extraction process now 
listen  ava 
this whole thing
could be very dangerous 
maybe  maybe we should
maybe we should what 
wait 
i ve got days until i m dead 
we re doing this bill 
now 
energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet 
we don t have much time before
mom s location shifts and we lose her 
yeah  and we have
a lot to do before then 
you know  my pep pep always said 
if you want to do something
right  you make a list 
so  we should do that 
one  we have to break into that lab 
two  we have to kick out
foster and ghost 
three  we re gonna have
to fight ghost 
that seems like it should be part of 2 
2 a  alright 
let s call it 2 a 
fight ghost  2 a 
also  we have to make sure
that the lab
is fully grown for you to come back 
otherwise  we re screwed 
scott 
you want me to start again 
i ll start again 
i m going to dive 
the only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here 
together 
protecting the tunnel 
let me do this  hope  please 
let me get her 
i think he s right 
whassup 
you don t remember 
that beloved commercial 
whassup 
i had him follow us 
i thought we could use some help 
alright 
i m in position 
the ants are headed in 
copy that 
keep your eyes peeled  scotty 
do you want pez 
no 
cassie gave me this for my birthday 
by the way  i love that suit 
thanks  man 
i wish i had a suit 
i would even  i would even like 
a suit with minimal powers  you know 
or maybe even just a suit 
with no powers 
what is it 
don t know 
it s them 
they can t be far 
hank  hank 
dad  what s your status 
foster s taken care of 
suiting up now 
i just wanted to save ava 
she s facing death
or something far more terrible 
she s afraid 
i ll help you find a cure when i get back 
i promise 
together  we ll figure something out 
good luck  hank 
thanks  bill 
now  i m gonna need you to step back 
time remaining  15 minutes 
hank s in  scott 
any sign of her 
no  nothing yet 
ava 
call off the ants  scott 
boy 
can i get a status report 
because i got some
serious ghost problems here

don t 
don t say that 
i can t lose you too 
i love you hope 
guys  everything s bad over here  please

meet us at the rendezvous point 
ok  on my way 
no 
really 
this guy again 
who 
i told you our business wasn t over 
change of plans 
hang on 
i want that lab  boys 
whatever it takes 
hold on

they got bigger problems 
hope  what re you doing 
you re heading away
from the rendezvous point 
don t worry  i m taking these
guys on the scenic route 
wait  what re you   
oh  my god  oh  my god 
we re gonna die 
we re gonna die 
signal lost 
what the hell are they doing up there 
recalibrating 
recalibrating 
you never said it was so beautiful  scott 
recalibrating 
ok  any time now 
recalibrating 
recalibrating 
come on 
signal restored 
bikes  it s all you 
take the wheel 
what  wait 
well  the 60 s were fun 
but now i m paying for it 
be careful up there 
hey  give me a break 
i haven t driven in two years 
you got pezed 
up here 
that s not good 
hope 
no 
no 
there it is  right there 
get the lab 
get    get  get the lab 
i ve got her 
westbound on fremont 
hope  wait 
hey  what about me 
we got you now  ava 
not again 
piece of junk 
yes 
go  go  go  go  go

work in progress  my ass
scott  where are you 
i ve got burch in my sights 
hurry 
i m coming  i m coming  i m coming 
we re running out of time 
warning  approaching quantum void 
i m coming to you  honey 
guys 
don t you need the remote to the lab 
i just found it 
we can t grow the lab without it 
get it to us fast 
yeah  but the van is busted 
use the hot wheels rally case 
what 
i love you  dr  pym 
the remote 
we re missing the remote 
you got to check the van 
awesome 
hey  i m going down pacific 
burch s boys are all over me 
i m on my way 
luis  i ll get the lab 
hi 
that s badass 
nice 
doink 
come here  you little weasel 
no  you don t 
i guess maybe you do 
come on 
anyone see a southern
gentleman carrying a building
