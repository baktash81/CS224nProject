but ill call you
when we get settled ok
when i have a better
indication of whats going on
mommy
jellybean
daddy and i have
a lastminute business trip
so rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days
no i dont want you to go
its gonna be so boring
i wont be able to keep my
eyes
goodbye sweetheart
alright well see you soon
ok
janet we got to go
i wish we could have
put down our bags
tucked you back into your bed
but too many lives were at stake
oh my god
theyve already launched
we have to stop it
come on
to disarm the missile
we had to get inside it
but the plating was too thick
the only way in was to shrink
between the molecules
i cant get through
hank
we both knew
that if you go that small
there is no coming back
it should have been me
but my regulator was damaged
your mothers wasnt
tell hope i love her
she turned it off
janet no
she went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb
your mother saved
thousands of lives that day
knowing shed be lost
in the quantum realm
alone
afraid
gone forever
telling you that she wasnt
coming home
was the hardest thing
that i ever had to do
but then scott showed up
or should i say broke into our house
and when he went
to the quantum realm
and came back
everything changed
i started to wonder
could your mother still be alive
so i dusted off some old plans
dad what are you saying
i think its possible to bring her back
ok were in
this place is a maze
wheres that map
were definitely close
you ready
im ready daddy
are you sure
because once were inside
you show any hesitation or fear
were done
i eat fear for breakfast
that is super cool
come on
look its anton
hell show us the way
anton which way do we go
anton which way do we go
thanks anton
look the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility
oh no lasers
i think i got lased
the secret vault
tell me you brought the contact lens
yup
perfect right there
there its the microtreasure
my trophy
it looks like treasure
oh it is to me
i want to take it to showandtell
oh no you cant do that
you cant
it never leaves the house
its too important
this is the best birthday
present you ever got me
im so touched you think im
the worlds greatest grandma
it was the only one they had
it makes me want
to knit you a sweater
oh no the fuzz
hey scotty
i was looking at the schematics
for the karapetyan buildings
and i think we have way too many
security cameras dont we
no no not at all
i mean because its a lot
of security cameras
i know what he needs
whos the security expert
in our business
you are but im running
the company right
and if we overquote him
hes gonna go somewhere else
i mean we got to land this bird
he aingt going anywhere
and the expression is land this fish
no its land the bird
just like you land the plane
you got to land the plane
to be in business
i know its silly to get hung up on
these kinds of things but i do
how am i gonna land a fish
it cant walk
and if it swam up on shore
and it battled a hawk
whos gonna win
youve really turned me around
on this thing
its ok
were gonna land karapetyan
now if you just excuse me
im in the middle of trying to
steal something with my daughter
im gonna go recheck it
to the escape ant
lets bounce
before the popo come back
the popo
how do you even know that
lets fly antoinette
lets fly
crash landing
i wish we could shrink for real
that is pretty cool
hey im headed to the office scotty
and sorry about freaking out earlier
you know
but i feel like im way better
my heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff
and my hands are shaking
but i think its unrelated you know
its gonna be great luis
you got nothing to worry about
yeah yeah im the boss
im the boss
im the boss
yeah yeah yeah yeah
daddy
come on
ive got three days left
why would i try to escape
sorry scott but rules are rules
you trip the perimeter alarm
we search the place
keel to stern soup to nuts
thank you
it was an accident
my foot went through the fence
our flying ant crashed
hey you try and entertain
a 10 year old
you cant leave the house
you know the lengths
that ive gone to
closeup magic
i learned that
why cant you just leave
my daddy alone
cassie
this must all seem like a bunch
of confusing grownup stuff to you
well think of it this way
your school has rules right
like you cant draw on the walls
well your daddy went to germany
and drew on the walls
with captain america
and that was a violation of article 16
paragraph three
of the sokovia accords
now as a part of his joint plea
deal with homeland security
and the german government
he was allowed to return to the us
provided he serve two years
under house arrest
followed by three years of probation
and avoid any unauthorized
activities technology
or contact with any former
associates who were
or currently are in violation
of said accords
or any related statutes
ok sweetie
youre really great with kids
thanks
im also a youth pastor
anyway not to be a johnny askalot
but you havent had any contact
with hank pym or hope van dyne
have you
no
you sure
because its only a matter
of time before we get them
it was their tech
so they violated the accords too
and associating with them
breaks your deal
and i dont need to remind you that
any violation of your agreement
means 20 years in prison
minimum
i havent talked to hank
or hope in forever
they hate his guts
thanks peanut
howd you do it scott
do what
the card trick
seriously
oh my god
you people cant just show up here
whenever you want
and search the place
actually they can
you need a warrant
actually they dont
really
did you pack your soccer shoes
yeah
alright
next time i see you
will be on the outside
alright
get on the inside of this
hey three days seriously
im proud of you bud
thank you
you know what
give me another one
me too gosh
freedom
new business
i am sensing greatness
i had a fun weekend daddy
me too peanut
but just wait till next weekend
once im outta here you and i
are gonna go paint this town red
well have so much ice cream
well never stop puking
youre getting good at that
howd you do that
bye daddy
bye
bye
bye
three days
easypeasy
snap your fingers
that gets them to look over there
and that is misdirection
we had a dream
wed go traveling together
wed spread a little loving
then wed keep moving on
easypeasy
where are you
everything that you know
lost
in the quantum realm
what
im gonna find you jellybean
i found you
you always find me mommy
what the hell
hey hank
its been a while
i dont even know if this is your number
anymore
and im probably the last person
you wanna hear from but
i just had a really weird dream
and i know that doesnt
sound like an emergency
or anything but
it just felt
very real
i was back in the quantum realm and
i
think i saw your wife
and then i was your wife
i mean not in a weird way or anything
you know
hearing this out loud im thinking
its not an emergency
im sorry to bother you
im sorry for a lot of things
that means one tiny atom
in my fingernail
could be one little tiny universe
hope
is this another dream
do you think it was a dream
or is it possible
that you really saw
my mom down there
im not sure
i cant be here
i cant be here
im under house arrest
they wont open while
the systems engaged scott
you have to take me home
they could show up any second
relax as far as your nanny cops
know youre still at home
scotty
hes programmed
to replicate your daily routine
nine hours in bed
five hours in front of the tv
two hours in the bathroom
whatever thats about
thats totally inaccurate
and how do you know
about my daily routine
are you spying on me
we keep tabs on all
security threats alright
and so far the biggest one
weve had is you
im sorry about germany
they just showed up
they said it was a matter
of national security
that cap needed help so
cap
tain america captain
cap
its what we call him
if youre a friend
im not saying im a friend of
a little i know him
hes nice whatever
im sorry alright
i i didnt think id get caught
you didnt think about a lot of things
hows hank
were still running
the house is gone so is our freedom
how do you think he is
im sorry i know youre mad
im not looking for an apology scott
the only reason
why were even talking is
because we need whats in your head
is this where youre living
if
you need help or money
or something maybe i can
were fine
hey hank
look i just wanna
save it
can we start
yeah
so while you were relaxing at home
we were building this
its a tunnel
to the quantum realm
to my mom
we think she might still be down there
we just dont know where
what
if we can pinpoint my moms location
then the pod can take me down
to get her
you built all this
and you dont even know
if shes alive
its called a hypothesis
last night we powered up
the tunnel for the first time
it was overloaded and it shut down
but for a split second
the doorway to the quantum realm
was opened
and
and five minutes later you called
talking about mom
we think when you were down there
you may have entangled with her
hank i would never do that
i respect you too much
quantum entanglement scott
we think she might have put some
kind of a message in your head
hopefully a location
and opening the tunnel triggered it
your mom put a message in my head
come on
thats insane
no scott
insane
is going to germany without telling us
and fighting the avengers
just tell me you werent lying
about the suit you took
tell me you really destroyed it
i did i destroyed it i swear
i cant believe you destroyed my suit
that was my lifes work
what was i supposed to do
you were supposed to not
take my suit
im sorry hank
im sorry i took the suit
im sorry that i called last night
i i i dont remember
seeing janet down there
i wish that i did
i just had a dream about her
playing hideandseek with a little girl
what
you i had a dream
she was playing
hideandseek with a
little
girl cassie and i do it all the time
doesnt mean anything
but was it cassie in the dream
no
where was she hiding
what
the little girl
where was she hiding
was it in a wardrobe
no it was in a tall dresser
you mean a wardrobe
is that what thats called
what color was it
red
were there horses on it
boy
its where i hid
every time that we played
it doesnt sound like
you really got the gist of the game
shes alive
i knew it
i knew it
we need to get that part
ok
the sooner we get the tunnel working
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head
does burch have it
yeah lets go
what part
whos burch
wait whats happening
we need a component to stop
the tunnel from overloading again
i grabbed your clothes
you might want to change
look id really like to help you
but if im not at home when they
come to take off my ankle monitor
then im going away forever
once we get the component
and power up the tunnel
well get the message
and have you home by lunch
we have to hurry
the entanglement wont last
you owe us
alright fine
but can i just wait inside
because im not supposed
to be out here
lets go
we good
yeah
ill be right back
can i have one of these
no
susan
welcome to oui
sonny
oui is french for yes
as in yes to farmtotable
yes to locally sourced
and yes to planet before profit
well lets hope it also means yes
to do you have the component
i ordered
you know i have always loved
your sense of humor susan
have a seat
no im good thank you
who is this guy
sonny burch
he traffics in black market technology
hes been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel
could i just have one
no
you know i have
a special friend at the fbi
and i say special because
well he tells me things
that i didnt previously know
for example
your name isnt susan
its hope van dyne
and your unseen associate
thats your father hank pym
thats not good hank
no shit
what do you want
relationships are built on trust hope
and i want our relationship
to have a strong foundation
our relationship
my business landscape
has been shifting hope
hell shieid and hydra dont even
exist anymore but now hank pym
hank pym is a real opportunity
do you have a point
you think that i dont know
what youve been building
with all this
quantum technology
now you can forget nanotech forget
ai forget cryptocurrency
quantum energy is the future
its the next gold rush
is that so
i want in hope
so as a gesture of good will
i have taken the liberty
of arranging some buyers
for your lab
starting bid
one billion dollars
thank you sonny really
but my father and i have something
slightly more pressing
than starting a business
so ill just take
the component as arranged
my buyers dont take no
for an answer
so we are either in business together
or we arent in business together
then i guess we arent
you can go
but im afraid your moneys
gonna have to remain
lets call it compensation
for my injured feelings
listen sonny
this is gonna be
so much easier on everybody
if you just give me that component
darling the only thing
youre taking from here
is my heart
but it will mend in time
ok
so now what
youll see
she said her and her daddy
had something pressing
i want to know what it is
because if theyre not working
with us
theyre working with somebody
so find out
i want some names
hold on you gave her wings
get her
not my turnofthecentury chandelier
stop firing
stop
alright take this go
go go go go go
go
wings and blasters
so i take it you didnt have
that tech available for me
no i did
it was a pleasure doing
business with you sonny
our business isnt finished yet hope
i can assure you of that
what in the hell is that
dad are you seeing this
hope get out of there
i got to do something
wait
it is still a work in progress
you taught me that kick
remember
yeah great form
those were the days
whatever happened to us
not the time scott
damn it whered it go
ive lost it
im not seeing anything
on the ant cams
try looking
dad
give me that
now
are you ok
no
he got the lab
no
come on
what was that
i dont know
but we need to find somewhere
to regroup
and figure out where the lab is
so where to now
how about my house
im supposed to be there anyway
and woo could walk in any second
exactly why were not going
to your house
what about your house
sorry
well there is one place i can think of
no
no no no no
no
dr pym
like like who would have thought that
once again
in your hour of need that
you would turn to us you know
not me
help yourself
hey whats up with the fancy pastry
we got to keep the food budget down
well what are we supposed
to have for breakfast
the oatmeal packets
oatmeal packets
its insult
why is it an insult
because it tastes like sand
you know why
its because its organic
its not organic its sand
its the most important meal
of the day
hey you know what
you can get creative with it
break teeth
put a little brown sugar on it
you can put some cinnamon
put a little honey
whatever you want
guys guys guys guys guys
come on man
we got bigger fish to fry
is that my desk
yeah
what
why do i have such a small desk
because you werent there
when we were choosing desks
you snooze you lose
well i was under house arrest
yeah
you know what this isnt even a desk
this is garbage
you found this outside
amongst garbage
i got it at a rummage sale
so you save money on my desk
guys
hope please
we need to focus alright
we got to find that lab already
jeez
you know what i heard stories
like what happened to you
like this crazy creepy cat
who walks through walls and stuff
like like a ghost
like baba yaga
baba yaga the witch
they tell stories to children
to frighten them
you know baba yaga
whoever stole it
we need to find it
you dont find someone like that
they find you
like baba yaga
dr pym youre the smartest
genius i know
didnt you put some kind
of lojack on your lab
because if you didnt
we have a variety of affordable options
of course i did luis
it was disabled
whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing
they also looked like
they were phasing
phasing
quantum phasing
when an object moves
through different states of matter
yeah thats what i was thinking
the lab emits radiation
can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it
that could work yes but all
my equipment is in the lab
where else can
we find that equipment
well there is one person
bill foster
great
whos bill foster
hes an old colleague of
my dads from shieid
they had a falling out years ago
you seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people
its probably just a waste of time
hey im risking everything
by being here
dont you think we should check
we need to find out who took the lab
guys its not a good idea
to be out in the open like this
relax no ones gonna recognize us
what because of hats and sunglasses
thats not a disguise hank
we look like ourselves
at a baseball game
in an isolated system
particles coexist
in a stable phase relationship
if the system is interfered with
that stability becomes chaos
unpredictable
dangerous
beautiful
isolated completely a quantum system
would revert back
to separate states of matter
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment
in other words
the object in question would be
both in and out of phase
with multiple parallel realities
speaking of being out of phase
with reality
i am noticing an unusually high number
of glazed eyes out there among you
so why dont we call it
a few minutes early
thatll be enough for today
thank you ladies
and gentlemen you may go
its incredible
youre linked to janet
its quantum entanglement
between the quantum states of
posner molecules in your brains
yeah thats what i was thinking
do you guys just put the word
quantum in front of everything
doctor we need to find our lab
hope id love to help you but
i dont have anything like the
equipment youre describing
i told you this is a waste of time
come on lets go
dont condescend hank
youre the one
whos on the run from the fbi
all because you had to grow to a size
that finally fit your ego
that wasnt me in germany
it was this idiot
really
going that big
it mustve been exhausting
i slept for three days straight
you have no idea
actually i do
back in the day i was
hanks partner
on a project called goliath
excuse me
you were my partner
the only thing more tiring
than going that big
is putting up with hanks bullshit
right
i dont know
how big did you get
my record
21 feet
not bad
you
i dont
no really im curious
65 feet
yeah
huge
if you two are finished comparing sizes
we need to figure out
a way to track down
the lab
and the great hank pym hasnt
figured that one out yet
strange
you had all the answers
back in the day
thats why i left the project
left
i fired you
best decision i ever made
hank was a terrible partner
temperamental
stubborn impatient
sooner or later
he just pushed everyone away
just the mediocrities
janet was the only one
who could endure him
and chose to stick it out
watch it bill
she paid the price though didnt she
you son of a bitch
i didnt come here
to listen to you two squabble
im trying to save my mother
now which office would you say
its woo
someone must have seen me
relax if this is about you
theyd be in your house by now
what are you 15
come on
we got to go right now
wait
you might be able
to improvise that tracker
if you modify the diffraction units
on one of your regulators
that could work
i dont know what that means
thank you
thank you
but doctor
campus police says
they idd both pym and van dyne
i dont know what to tell you agent
i havent talked to hank in 30 years
i can assure you im the last person
he would want to visit
come on you expect us to
hey hey
why is that
simple
we hate each others guts
so im a terrible partner
foster he hasnt had one good idea
in his unremarkable career
but his idea about
the diffractors could work right
fine one decent idea
except i eliminated the diffractors
when i upgraded the suits
so if we had an old suit
we might be able
to track down the lab
yes but we dont
what if we did
what do you mean
i mean
lifes funny
oh my god
you didnt destroy the suit
what
well it was your lifes work hank
i couldnt destroy that
before i turned myself in
i shrunk it down and mailed it to luis
you sent my suit through the mail
hey the postal service is very reliable
you know
they do tracking numbers now
like ups
where is it
its in a very safe place alright
dont worry
what the trophy
no its not here
what do you mean its not there
where could it be
i looked everywhere
its not here
hey get away from the plant
but i put it back after cassie and i
showandtell
scotty
no stop
well the good news is
i know where it is
whenever you go back to school
isnt everything supposed
to look so much smaller
this place seems huge
what is it
its the new regulator
hank whats going on with this suit
how much of a work
in progress is this
no no no
what are you laughing
please could you just
ok ok
what do you see
the sizing coils are malfunctioning
just let me
sorry
its alright
ok
alright
try that
sorry
what
awesome
if only cap could see you now
hilarious
what are we gonna do
hey
wheres your hall pass
hey im talking to you
hey
hey
you can do it
you almost got it
peanut
ok lets go
hiya champ how was school today
alright get your jokes out now
can you fix the suit
so cranky
you want a juice box
and some string cheese
do you really have that
lets see if foster was right
this has got to be the lab
lets go get it
yeah
this seems right
look at us
teaming up twice in one day
makes you think
about what
germany
what do you mean
we were working together
training together and
other stuffing together
if i had asked you
would you have come
i guess well never know
but i do know one thing
what
if i had youd have never been caught
hey scott
you think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter
long enough to get my lab
yes sir
thank you
ok youre transmitting
what took you so long
sorry i had to come
up with a name for my ant
im thinking ulysses s grant
you like it
hilarious
im not getting anything
on the monitors
some kind of
electronic disturbance
be careful
you know me hank
im always care
its ok
its just the suit
how do you know
look
thats ghost
what is she doing
do you think that suit is how she
goes through walls and stuff
lets just get outta here
before she wakes up
hope look
theres the lab
now were sure
this is our shrunken building
and not somebody elses right
just take it scott
come on we got to be fast
ill get it
shit
hope hope hank
guys
i dont think they can hear you
hi
im ava
scott
so
you dont need the suit to
you know
go through things
no
it just
helps me control it
and the pain
supposedly
youre not gonna reach into my chest
and crush my heart are you
youre funny
im not gonna hurt you scott
unless i have to
i need
whats in your head
lets wake up the rest of the gang
and get this over with shall we
get up
come on
dad
dont ever touch him again
now now hope
i think im being rather gentle with
your father all things considered
what the hell are you talking about
another casualty of hank pyms ego
bill
what have you done
its what youve done dr pym
youre with her
man i thought you were cool
what the hell is going on here
i doubt hank has
ever mentioned my father
why would he
elihas starr
they were colleagues at shieid
quantum research
until my father dare disagree
with the great hank pym
you had him fired
and discredited for good measure
my father tried to continue
his research on his own
desperate to restore his name
so he took risks
no no no
too many
until something went wrong
he told us to run
elihas whats happening
just go go
daddy daddy
i could tell he was scared
daddy
ava no
i didnt want him to be alone
no no
when i woke up
my parents were dead
i wasnt so lucky
they call it molecular disequilibrium
a rather dull name i think
doesnt quite do justice
to what it means
every cell in my body is torn apart
and stitched back together
over and over
every day
i was still at shieid
when i got the call about a
quantum anomaly in argentina
hello ava
my names bill
i was a friend of your fathers
i brought you something
its alright
try again
thats it
dr foster did his best
to keep me safe
but others at shieid
saw an opportunity in my affliction
they built me a containment suit
so i could control my phasing
and trained me to be
a stealth operative
they weaponized me
i stole for them
spied for them
killed for them
and in exchange for my soul
they were going to cure me
they lied
when shieid collapsed
i took ava in
i built the chamber to slow her decay
but her condition was progressive
i didnt know how to cure it
she wanted to kill you hank
but i told her no
and that she should watch
you instead
and sure enough
she discovered that you
were building the tunnel
then she told me about lang
and the message from janet
inside his head
thats when i
christs sake
thats me im sorry
look can you tell me
whos texting me
cassie 911
thats my daughter
i need to text her back
no thats not happening
what its 911
that means its an emergency
youre not making
demands here lang
youre not appreciating
the gravity of the
ok look shes trying
to video chat me now
something might be wrong
let me talk to her please
cassie are you ok
whats the emergency
i cant find my soccer shoes
what
i have a game tomorrow
hey scott i know that theyre there
can you just walk the phone
around the house
no i cant do that right now
why not
because im sick
hey can you just maybe look around
later then and call me back
please thank you
bye daddy
bye peanut
feel better
feel better buddy
im sorry
it said emergency
ava i want to help you
she doesnt need your help
i know how to save her
really how
janet
for the last 30 years shes been
down there absorbing quantum energy
we can extract that energy
we can use it to repair
avas molecular structure
extract it
yes
are you insane
that would rip janet apart
you dont know that
im gonna fire up your tunnel
when janets location pops into
langs head hes gonna give it to me
or im gonna turn him over to the fbi
what
you are gonna stay here
just in case i need your help
like hell i would help you
youll do whatever i say
youre gonna kill janet
id be more worried about yourself hank
goddamn it bill
dad
calm down hank
so help me god
the pills
its his heart
he needs his pills
please dr foster
theyre in the tin please
he could die
come on
help him
dad just hang on alright
just keep breathing
stay calm
help him man come on
the altoid tin
wait
thanks guys
hank
bill is filling that girls head with lies
elihas starr was a traitor
he stole my plans
now bring it down
alright lock it in
no no no
the bolt is on the other side
tighten that one down
then bring it down one notch
good job
itll work
foster he could have fried
the entire system
look well adjust the relays
while you go reprogram
the settings alright
its going to be fine
so this is it
yeah
youd think with all this time
to prepare id be more ready
going subatomic isnt
something you can prepare for
it kind of melts your mind
i mean seeing my mom again
what if shes a completely
different person
yeah like george washington
im serious scott
or george jefferson
what if shes forgotten about me
when i was in prison
the only thing that got me
through was cassie
i could have been locked up
for 100 years
i never would have forgotten her
i know your mom
is counting the minutes
until she can see you again
thank you
hey
we got a big problem
you forgot the motion sensor lights
on the back of the building
no
and theyre on the proposal
and karapetyan
asked for them specifically
yeah look its been a little crazy
look maybe i could stop
by tomorrow take a look at it
no no no no no
the meeting is first thing
in the morning
you got to come right now and fix it
i cant i wish i could but i cant leave
you know what im coming to you
ill just bring the plans
theyre on the laptop
and you can fix them there
just tell me where you are ok
its complicated
what do you mean its complicated
as you can see sir
this system is state of the art
security of tomorrow today
thats so good
and i love the leanin bro
keep practicing
hey i just got to drive up to scottys
so we can fix the plans
but dont worry ill be back
in plenty of time
as you can see
tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning
down to the undercarriage baby
you sprung for
the undercarriage wash
well you said get the works
thats a scam bro
we live in california not minnesota
hes right
the undercarriage wash
thats for cleaning off road salt
laid down in our more
snowladen sister states
who are you and why do you know
so much about car wash protocol
well my name is sonny burch
and i do my research luis
to wit i have learned
from a friend of mine
at the fbi that you are
a known associate of scott lang
a known associate of hank pym
who ive also learned
has a portable shrinking laboratory
filled with all kinds of juicy tech
and youre gonna tell me where it is
well i hate to break it to you but
i dont know what youre talking about
well i sense a resistance in you luis
and i have promised results
to some dangerous people
so im gonna introduce you
to my good friend uzman
now
uzman is a master
at extracting information from the
unwilling through psychoactive means
is that truth serum
theres no such thing as truth serum
thats just nonsense from tv
well what is it then
its a little concoction
that hes been perfecting
since his days with the sis
it makes you suggestible
and highly responsive
well dude thats truth serum
no its not
no offensing
but they sound like truth serum to me
right
its not a truth serum
ok hey i believe you
its not a truth serum
i mean if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks
the truth serum
well i have a lot of allergies so
you might wanna think about that
weve got to get that lab back
what
the chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore
how long have i got
a couple of weeks maybe
well then well make them
bring the lab back
how
lang he has a daughter right
you cant mean that
ava
i tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there
but i wont be a part of anything like that
youre not the one whos about
to fade away into nothing bill
i am
you said you could fix me
you promised
i know i will
but not like that
you lay one finger on that little girl
i wont help you
and were done
fine
there are other options
you know what youre right
this isnt truth serum
because i dont feel anything
that was a lie
i do feel something
this is truth serum
theres no such thing
ok
ok ok
now im gonna make this
real easy for you luis
ok
where is scott lang
well see thats complicated
because when i first met scotty
he was in a bad place
and im not talking about cell block d
his wife had just filed for divorce
and i was like damn homie
she dumped you when youre on lockup
and he was like yeah i know
i thought i was gonna be
with her forever
but now im all alone
and i was like damn homie
you know what
you got to chin up
because youll find a new partner
but you know what im luis
and he says you know what
im scotty and were gonna be
best friends
ok hold on hold on
i like a good story
as much as the next person
but what in the hell
does this have to do
with where scott lang is
im getting there
im getting there
you put a dime in him
you got to let the whole song play out
he like human jukebox
my abuelita had a jukebox
in the restaurant
yeah only played morrissey
and if anybody ever complained
shed be like
oh no te gusta moz
you know chicanos
we call him moz
then adios
what can i say we relate to his
melancholy ballads you know
lang
right right right right right
so anyway scotty gets out of jail
and he starts working for hank
thats when he met hope
and hopes all like
i want nothing to do with you
look at my hairdo im all business
and then scottys like
you know what girl
my heart is all broken
and ill probably never find love again
but damn if i want to kiss you
but then you fast forward and
theyre all into each other right
and then scottys like
you know what
i cant tell you this
but im gonna go trash an
airport with captain america
and then she said i cant
believe you split like that
smell you later dummy
so scotty goes on house arrest
and he wont admit it
but his heart is all like
damn i thought hope coulda been
my new true partner but i blew it
but fate brought them back together
and then hopes heart is all
im worried that i cant trust him
and hes gonna screw up
again and ruin everything
and then my heart is all like
that fancy raspberry filling
represents the companys red
and were days away from
going out of business
out of business
days away
damn truth serum
and you know
i was trying to protect you guys
i swear to god
and you know i was trying to be
a good boss but were broke
and the karapetyans our last hope
and if we dont show up were done
thats terrible bossing
damn bro
thats on me thats on me
hey
enough
im gonna ask you one more time
where is scott lang
ive been trying to tell you hes in
a tricky spot emotionally speaking
emotionally speaking
well where is scott lang
literally speaking
the woods
the woods
baba yaga
what do you mean the woods
the muir woods the second fire road
off the panoramic highway
for gods sake
baba yaga come at night
little children sleepy tight
damn it
if that freak gets pyms tech
im never gonna see it
so what do we do now
its easier to steal it from the feds
than from the boogeyman
hey its me
howd you like to get a promotion
i got the location on pym
van dyne and lang
but you gonna have
to take them down now
because they aingt gonna be
there for long
and when you do
you gonna get me that lab
understood
good news gentlemen
feds are gonna do
the hard work for us
what are you looking at
change my tires
right
sir
can you knock
sorry sir
but i just got a lead
i love leads
systems in the green
priming the coils
full charge
as soon as the tunnels open
let us know if you get anything
that could be a part of her message
yeah yeah i will
ok then
here it goes
we did it
you got anything
nothing
well just give it a minute
because it could
no
no no no no
whats happening
its shutting down
maybe our vectors are off
weve gone over them a million
times i know theyre right
then what else could it be
i dont know
scott what are you doing
scott get away from that
scott you cant
im sorry i dont know
how much time i have
i need to fix the algorithm
trust me after 30 years down here
ive thought about it a lot
janet
hi honey
jellybean
mom
its not the reunion id imagined
its all so rushed
you two have done such great work
you just need a little
nudge
janet how is this possible
it wasnt a message you put
in scotts head
it was an antenna
clever girl
im so proud of you
honey tell us where you are
tell us how to find you
no the probability fields
are too complex
thats why i needed to talk to you
you have to follow my voice
of course
like tracing a call back to its source
im tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies
between point two and point nine
id narrow it to four and six
thats too tight
we could miss you
look at us squabbling again
fine alright between three and seven
our first fight in decades
and its over just like that
bullseye
source lock
its you
we got it
you have to meet me
at these exact coordinates
in the wasteland
beyond the quantum void
its very dangerous
especially on the human mind
so be careful
time and space work very
differently down here
you have two hours
after that the probability fields will
shift and itll be another century
before they align like this again
well find you
i know you will jellybean
nope
nothing i got nothing
no sign of janet
perfect
how did we get up here
alright first youre gonna see
all kinds of lights
and its gonna get really trippy
but then its gonna turn
black and silent
really silent
scott ill be fine
im just saying
because ive been down there
yeah so youve mentioned
sorry
i have to take this
hey man you coming
no im not but you know what
ghost is
and you know what the feds
they know where you are
what
im sorry im sorry
they gave me some truth serum
and then all of a sudden
i started talking all honestly
like i hate the way
that you load the dishwasher
i hate it i hate it
but you need to go home
because the feds
are probably going there now
and by the way who puts the
plates on the top rack ok
they dont go there
i feel like such a jerk
youre gonna be really mad
we got to go now
what
ghost knows where we are
so does the fbi
how
i told luis where we are
you what
i told him to come here
so i could help him
with the karapetyan proposal
oh my god
look we need to land that account
otherwise we lose the business
do you know hard it is for excons
to find work these days
jesus scott
shit
90 seconds to close the aperture
you have to depolarize the coils first
i know
im really sorry but the
fbi is coming to my place so
i have to go
can i borrow the suit
gyroscopic stabilizers
powering on
im just gonna borrow the suit
ill come back
just tell me where youll be
dont bother
what
well come and get the suit from you
as soon as weve found my mom
hope
scott just go
scott
daddy
its us buddy
were here for cassies shoes
he must be resting
honey why dont you go upstairs
and look under your bed
daddy you upstairs
daddy
what the
he really lives like a pig these days
daddy
spread out
again
you people have no shame
the monitor says
that hes in the bathroom
yeah im not buying it
cassie let the man get by
but daddys super sick
ill see about that
he says he doesnt want
anyone else to get sick
well ill take my chances sweetie
he barfed like a lot
young lady im a federal agent
ive seen worse things than vomit
like a lot a lot
yes
forget it move aside
no
what are you doing here
scott
sor im sorry im just really sick
i told you
excuse me
sometimes you got to just get it out
you know
sorry
ill start the van
you get the lab
freeze
youre surrounded
dont move
hank pym
hope van dyne
youre under arrest
this is harassment
actually its not
what does the fbi even stand for
forever bothering individuals
his monitor check out
of course it does
damn it
looks like i just got fed
a bowl of malarkey
we got them sir
pym and van dyne are in custody
seriously yes
im sorry scott
theyre your friends
thats insensitive
i just really needed a win you know
anyway ill be back later
for the official end of your sentence
sorry for misjudging you pal
you should feel great about yourself
what is it
we have a man down
and pyms lab is gone
hey
thanks for covering for me
sure
so
how long have you been
antman again
not long
it just sort of happened
im sorry for lying to you
and im sorry for risking everything
daddy its ok
its not
i do some dumb things
and the people that i love
the most pay the price
mainly you
trying to help people isnt dumb
well
i screw it up just about every time
so maybe you just need
someone watching your back
like a partner
well shes made it clear
thats about the last thing she wants
who
hope
wait who did you think
me
you
dont laugh
id be a great partner
peanut
you would be awesome
and if i let you
i would be a terrible dad
fine
then have hope be your partner
shes smart
she reminds me of you
you gonna go help her
i think you should help her
i wish i could but
i dont know how i could help her
without hurting you
you can do it
you can do anything
you are the worlds greatest grandma
agent woo will see you in an hour
an hour
we dont have an hour
you got somewhere else to be
now thats my girl
alright whats our plan
to shrink that wall
it looks loadbearing
the ceiling could collapse
then we run like hell
now i estimate 1520 agents
on the floor
roughly five times that
in the building at large
theyre all heavily armed
not great odds
you got any better ideas
nope
and im not giving up on mom
shed be so proud of you
ok
one
two
scott
whatre you two
just standing around for
we got to go find that lab
what about me
perfect
hurry up and get dressed
we dont have much time
ok now what
youre asking me

hi
hi
excuse me are we planning
on leaving soon
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other

yeah
hey burch
yeah
yeah theyre out
im on my way
her suit is missing and so is the van
how could this happen
i mean what the dickens
thank you
youre welcome
so how do we find the lab
after we lost it the first time
i put on a new tracker
of sorts
thatll work
is it ready or not
we can begin
the extraction process now
listen ava
this whole thing
could be very dangerous
maybe maybe we should
maybe we should what
wait
ive got days until im dead
were doing this bill
now
energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet
we dont have much time before
moms location shifts and we lose her
yeah and we have
a lot to do before then
you know my peppep always said
if you want to do something
right you make a list
so we should do that
one we have to break into that lab
two we have to kick out
foster and ghost
three were gonna have
to fight ghost
that seems like it should be part of 2
2a alright
lets call it 2a
fight ghost 2a
also we have to make sure
that the lab
is fully grown for you to come back
otherwise were screwed
scott
you want me to start again
ill start again
im going to dive
the only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here
together
protecting the tunnel
let me do this hope please
let me get her
i think hes right
whassup
you dont remember
that beloved commercial
whassup
i had him follow us
i thought we could use some help
alright
im in position

i used to be a respected scientist
i had my name
on the sides of buildings
now i got this
well you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel
this is
smaller
sorry
my bad
i think it has flair
alright controls online
the collection unit activates
when you decouple it
it should automatically start
absorbing quantum healing particles
also make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields
theyre cute but theyll eat you
and dont get sucked into a time vortex
we wont be able to save you
ok
going subatomic in five
four

alright scott this is a mic check
mic check one two

scott we read you
i just wanna make sure
