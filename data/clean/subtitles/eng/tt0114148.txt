lt s glory  god and gold
and the virginia company
steady as the beating drum
singing to the cedar flute
seasons go and seasons come
bring the corn and bear the fruit
by the waters sweet and clean
where the mighty sturgeon lives
plant the squash and reapa the bean
all the earth our mother gives
oh  great spirit  hear our song
helpa us keepa the ancient ways
keepa the sacred fire strong
walk in balance all our days
seasons go and seasons come
steady as the beating drum
plum to seed to bud to palum
steady as the beating drum
it s good to be home 
the massawomecks are defeated 
with the help of our brothers 
our villages are safe again 
your return has brought much joy to the village 
look at all the smiling faces 
yes  but there s one smiling face i don t see 
  where is my daughter 
  you know pocahontas 
she has her mother s spirit 
she goes wherever the wind takes her 
pocahontas 
your father s back 
come down here 
he s back  flit 
come on  meeko 
no  not that way 
show off 
uh oh 
pocahontas 
pocahontas  are you all right 
well  you better be all right
because i m not coming in after you 
don t you think we re getting a  
a little old for these games 
help me turn this thing over 
  what were you doing up there 
  thinking 
  meeko 
  about the dream again  have you figured it out yet 
i know it means something 
i just don t know what 
you should ask your father about it 
maybe i should 
come on  flit 
quit playing around 
we have to get back 
   faced a determined enemy 
the battle lasted from the rising of the sun
until the evening shadows fell 
our warriors fought with courage  but none
as bravely as kocoum   
for he attacked with the fierce strength of the bear 
  he has proven himself to be the greatest of warriors   
  oh  he is so handsome 
  and the finest among us   
  hmph  i especially love his smile 
destroying every enemy in his path 
tonight we will feast in his honour 
  my daughter 
  wing gapa o  father 
seeing you gives me great joy 
i m so glad you ve come home safely 
come with me 
we have much to talk about 
i want to hear everything you ve been doing 
father  for many nights now
i ve been having a very strange dream 
i think it s telling me something s about to happen 
something exciting 
yes  something exciting is about to happen 
  really  what is it 
  kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage 
marry kocoum 
i told him it would make my heart soar 
but he s so serious 
my daughter  kocoum will make a fine husband 
he is loyal and strong and will build you a good house
with sturdy walls 
with him  you will be safe from harm 
father  i think my dream is pointing me down another path 
 this is the right path for you 
 but why can t i choose  
pocahontas  come with me 
you are the daughter of the chief 
it is time to take your place among our people 
even the wild mountain stream   
must someday join the big river 
as the river cuts his paath
though the river s paroud and strong
he will choose the smoothest course
that s why rivers live so long 
they re steady
as the steady beating drum
your mother wore this for our wedding 
it was her dream to see you
wear it at your own 
it suits you 
he wants me to be steady
like the river 
but it s not steady at all 
what i love most about rivers
is you can t stepa in the same river twice
the water s always changing
always flowing
but people  i guess can t live like that
we all must pay a price
to be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing
what s around the river bend
waiting just around the river bend
i look once more just around the river bend
beyond the shore where the gulls fly free
don t know what for
what i dream the day might send
just around the river bend
for me
coming for me
i feel it there beyond those trees or right
behind these waterfalls
can i ignore that sound of distant drumming
for a handsome sturdy husband who builds
handsome  sturdy walls
and never dreams that something might be coming
just around the river bend
just around the river bend
i look once more just around the river bend
beyond the shore
somewhere past the sea
don t know what for
why do all my dreams extend
just around the river bend
just around the river bend
should i choose the smoothest course
steady as the beating drum
should i marry kocoum
is all my dreaming at an end
or do you still
wait for me
dream giver
just around the river
bend
is that my pocahontas 
grandmother willow 
i need to talk to you 
good morning  child 
i was hoping you d visit today 
oh  why  your mother s necklace 
that s what i wanted to talk to you about 
my father wants me to marry kocoum 
kocoum  but he s so serious 
i know  my father thinks it s the right path for me 
but lately  i ve been having
this dream and i think it s  
oh  a dream 
let s hear all about it 
quiet 
quiet 
now  child  you were saying 
well  i m running through the woods   
and then  right there in front of me  is an arrow 
as i look at it  it starts to spin 
a spinning arrow 
how unusual 
yes  it spins faster and faster and faster
until suddenly it stops 
hmm  well  it seems to me   
this spinning arrow is pointing you down your path 
but  grandmother willow  what is my path 
how am i ever going to find it 
your mother asked me the very same question 
she did  what did you tell her 
i told her to listen 
all around you are spirits  child 
they live in the earth  the water  the sky 
if you listen  they will guide you 
  i hear the wind 
  yes 
what is it telling you 
i don t understand 
you will understand
listen with your heart
you will understand
let it break upon you
like a wave upon the sand
it s saying something s coming 
strange clouds 
listen with your heart
  you will understand
  you will understand
what do you see 
clouds  strange clouds 
look at it  wiggins 
an entire new world chock full of gold   
just waiting for me 
and scores of adventures waiting for us 
right  percy 
  do you think we ll meet some savages 
  if we do  we shall be sure   
  to give them a proper english greeting 
  ooh  gift baskets 
oh  no  and he came so highly recommended 
it s perfect  governor  the water s deep enough 
we can pull right up to shore 
hey there  percy 
  very well  then  give the order 
  already done  sir 
i ve got a crew assembled
and they re ready to go 
about the natives  i m counting on you   
to make sure those filthy heathens
don t disrupt our mission 
well  if they re anything like the savages
i ve fought before  it s nothing i can t handle 
right  that ll be all  smith 
there s a good man 
see you  percy 
the men like smith  don t they 
  i ve never been a popular man 
  i like you 
and don t think i don t know what those
back stabbers at court say about me 
oh  yes  all that talk about being a pathetic
social climber who s failed at everything   
  he s tried 
  i m very well aware that this is my last chance for glory 
but mark my words  wiggins  when king james
sees the gold these peasants unearth   
success will be mine at last 
  wake up  shake a leg 
  top off the yardarm 
  it s incredible 
  and it s all ours  i ve never seen anything like it 
it could look like ratcliffe s
knickers  for all i care   
just as long as i get off  this stinkin  boat 
come on  men  we didn t come
all this way just to look at it 
keep it taut  lads 
keep it taut 
  steady  steady 
  hold up  that s far enough 
all right  now  tie her off 
here john  tie off this end 
john  john 
  what are you doing up there 
  getting a better look 
hey 
well  you re a
strange looking fellow 
are you hungry 
here you go

john  you better get down here 
the governor s coming ashore

i m leaving 
did you see their skin 
they have hair on their faces like dogs 
my brothers  we must know more
about these visitors 
kekata  what do you see 
these are not men like us   
but strange beasts with bodies
that shine like the sun   
and weapons that spout fire and thunder 
they prowl the earth
like ravenous wolves   
consuming everything in their path 
great powhatan  i will lead our
warriors to the river and attack 
we will destroy these invaders
the way we destroyed the massawomecks 
kocoum  in that battle
we knew how to fight our enemy 
but these pale visitors
are strange to us 
take some men to the river
to observe them 
let us hope they do not intend to stay 
i hereby claim this land
and all its riches   
in the name of his majesty
king james the first   
and do so name this settlement jamestown 
bravo  bravo 
beautifully spoken  sir 
hurry now  percy  we must be all
squeaky clean for the new world 
captain smith  it appears i ve selected the
perfect location  eh  not a savage in sight 
just because we don t see them
doesn t mean they re not out there  sir 
well  then perhaps you should venture forth
and determine their whereabouts  hmm 
if there are any indians
out there  i ll find them 
 now  gentlemen  to work  you men  get the ship unloaded 
 right  sir 
you men  build the fort 
the rest of you  break out the shovels

found when they came to the new world 
gold  mountains of it 
why  for years they ve been
ravaging the new world   
of its most precious resources

 we re going to build them here 
we ll show your people how to use this
land properly  how to make the most of it 
  make the most of it

  we ll build roads and decent houses and  
  our houses are fine 
you think that only because
you don t know any better 
w wait a minute 
don t take it tha   hey  hey 
wait  wa wait 
there s so much we can teach you 
  we ve improved the lives of savages
all over the world 
  savages 
uh  not that you re a savage 
 just my people 
  no  listen  that s not what
i meant  let me explain  uh  
  let go 
  no  i m not letting you leave 
look  don t do this 
savage is just a word  uh  you know 
  a term for people who are uncivilized 
  like me 
well  when i say uncivilized  what i mean is  is  
what you mean is  not like you 
you think i m an ignorant savage
and you ve been so many palaces
i guess it must be so
but still i cannot see
if the savage one is me
how can there be so much that you don t know
you don t know
you think you own whatever land you land on
the earth is just a dead thing you can claim
but i know every rock and tree and creature
has a life  has a spirit
has a name
you think the only people who are people
are the people who look
and think like you
but if you walk the footstepas
of a stranger
you ll learn things
you never knew you never knew
have you ever heard the wolf cry
to the blue corn moon
or asked the grinning bobcat
why he grinned
can you sing with all the voices
of the mountain
can you paint
with all the colours of the wind
can you paint
with all the colours
of the wind
come run the hidden paine trails
of the forest
come taste the sun sweet berries
of the earth
come roll in all the riches
all around you
and for once never wonder
what they re worth
the rainstorm and the river
are my brothers
the heron and the otter
are my friends
and we are all connected
to each other
in a circle
in a hoop that never ends
how high does the sycamore grow
if you cut it down then you ll never know
and you ll never hear the wolf
cry to the blue corn moon
for whether we are white or copapaer skinned
we need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
we need to paint with all the colours of the wind
you can own the earth and still
all you ll own is earth until
you can paint
with all the colours
of the wind
what is it 
the drums 
they mean trouble  i shouldn t be here 
  i want to see you again 
  i can t 
  please  don t leave 
  i m sorry 
i have to go 
all right 
this one s ready to hoist 
  two on each side 
  ready now  push

  come on  lads  it s only a little picket fence 
  steady  steady 
  there you go 
that ll keep everything out  eh john

last time  eh  mates

oh  sure  we re having loads of fun  right 
look at us  no gold  no food 
while ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day 
happy as a clam 
i am doomed 
i should be wallowing in riches by now and i haven t
found as much as a speck 
think  think 
it s got to be around here somewhere 
where could it be 
i ve mined the forests and the hills and the swamps 
and nothing 
why can t i find it 
what am i overlooking 
i   i  
i made it myself 
take that silly  
of course  the indians 
wiggins  why do you think those
insolent heathens attacked us 
because we invaded their land and cut down
their trees and dug up their earth 
it s the gold  they have it and they don t
want us to take it from them 
well  i ll just have to take it
by force  then  won t i 
you there 
where s captain smith 
well  he s gone 
aye  your singing must have scared them off 
  well  then go get him  for heaven s sake 
  what if we run into the indians 
that s what guns are for 
now arm yourselves and get moving 
pocahontas 
you should be inside the village 
  we ll be all right 
  we re gathering food for when the warriors arrive 
  don t go far  now is not the time to be running off 
  yes  father 
when i see you wear that necklace   
you look just like your mother 
  i miss her 
  but she is still with us 
whenever the wind moves through the trees 
i feel her presence 
our people looked to her for wisdom and strength 
someday  they will look to you as well 
i would be honoured by that 
you shouldn t be out here alone 
i ll send for kocoum 
  all right  what is it 
  what 
  you re hiding something 
  i m not hiding anything 
pocahontas  you can tell me

excitement in 200 years 
what am i doing  i shouldn t be seeing him again 
i mean  i want to see him again 
who wouldn t 
i want to see him again 
but still  something inside is telling me
it s the right thing 
  perhaps it s your dream 
  my dream 
do you think he s the one the
spinning arrow was pointing to 
hmm 
the warriors are here 
pocahontas  are you crazy 
what were you doing with one of them 
  there you are

we will defeat this enemy 
  father  i need to speak with you 
  not now  my daughter 
  the council is gathering 
  we don t have to fight them 
there must be a better way 
sometimes our paths are chosen for us 
  but maybe we should try talking to them 
  they do not want to talk 
but if one of them did want to talk  you would
listen to him  wouldn t you 
  pocahontas 
  wouldn t you 
of course i would  but it is not that simple 
nothing is simple any more 
easy  thomas  it s me 
oh john  i could ve killed you 
not aiming like that  you couldn t 
keep both eyes open when you shoot 
you ll see twice as well 
  smith  there you are 
  we were looking all over for you 
smith  where have you been 
i was out scouting the terrain  sir 
excellent  then you must know
the indians  whereabouts 
  we ll need that information for the battle 
  what battle 
we will eliminate these savages once and for all 
no  you can t do that 
oh  can t i 
look  we don t have to fight them 
  john  what s gotten into you 
  i met one of them 
  you what 
  a savage 
they re not savages 
they can help us 
they know the land 
they know how to navigate the rivers 
  and look  it s food 
  what is it 
  it s better than hardtack and gruel  that s for sure 
  i like gruel 
they don t want to feed us  you ninnies 
they want to kill us  all of us 
they ve got our gold  and they ll do anything
to keep it 
  but there is no gold 
  no gold 
and i suppose your little
indian friend told you this 
  yes 
  lies  lies  all of it 
murderous thieves 
there s no room for their kind in civilized society 
  but this is their land 
  this is my land  i make the laws here 
and i say anyone who so much
as looks at an indian   
without killing him on sight
will be tried for treason   
and hanged 
  pocahontas 
  nakoma 
don t go out there 
i lied for you once 
  don t ask me to do it again 
  i have to do this 
  he s one of them 
  you don t know him 
if you go out there  you ll be turning your back
on your own people 
i m trying to help my people 
pocahontas  please 
you re my best friend 
  i don t want you to get hurt 
  i won t 
  i know what i m doing 
  pocahontas  no  
ratcliffe wouldn t take us
halfway around the world for nothin  
but what if smith is right 
what if there is no gold 
if you ask me  ratcliffe s been lying to us
since we left london 
listen to you  ya bunch of idiots 
those savages didn t attack us for nothin  
they re hidin  somethin  
if they do have the gold 
i reckon we ll have to fight  em 
  not me 
  either too hot or too cool 
i haven t been comfortable since we got here 
oh  i know 
i ve been itching a lot 
  follow him 
  yes  governor 
  i want to know where he s sneaking off to 
  yes  sir 
and if you happen to see any indians  shoot them 
oh  and thomas  you ve been a slipshod sailor and
a poor excuse for a soldier 
don t disappoint me again 
  kocoum

  it s pocahontas 
  what s wrong  is she all right 
i think she s in trouble 
the earth is trembling  child 
what s happened 
  the warriors are here 
  pocahontas 
john 
listen to me  my men are
planning to attack your people 
  you ve got to warn them 
  maybe it s not too late to stop this 
you have to come with me
and talk to my father 
pocahontas  talking isn t
going to do any good 
i already tried talking to my men  but
everything about this land has them spooked 
that s the strangest creature
i ve ever seen 
percy 
  easy  percy  come here 
  meeko  come back 
you see what i mean 
once two sides want to fight  nothing can stop them 
  come   come here  both of you 
  it s all right  it s all right  he s a friend 
bad  bad dog  sit 
  what are you doing  meeko 
  percy  get back here 
  what are you doing  stop that 
  all right  that s enough 
it s enough to make your sap boil 
now then  there s something
i want to show you  look 
  the ripples 
  what about them 
so small at first  then look how they grow 
but someone has to start them 
they re not going to listen to us 
young man  sometimes the right
path is not the easiest one 
don t you see 
only when the fighting stops can you be together 
all right  let s go talk to your father 
no 
kocoum  no 
kocoum 
leave him alone 
kocoum  stop 
both eyes open 
thomas 
  is he  
  you killed him 
  i thought that  
  get away from him 
  pocahontas  it won t help  he was only  
  he killed him 
thomas  get out of here 
get out of here 
  who did this 
  pocahontas was out in the woods 
kocoum went to find her
and this white man attacked him 
your weapons are strong 
but now our anger is stronger 
  at sunrise he will be the first to die 
  but  father  
i told you to stay in the village 
you disobeyed me  you have shamed your father 
i was only trying to help 
because of your foolishness 
kocoum is dead 
take him away 
kocoum was just coming to protect me 
pocahontas  i sent kocoum after you 
i was worried about you 
i i thought i was doing the right thing 
all this happened because of me 
and now i ll never see john smith again 
come with me 
pocahontas wants to look into the eyes
of the man who killed kocoum 
be quick 
pocahontas 
  i m so sorry 
  for what  this 
i ve gotten out of worse scrapes than this 
can t think of any right now  but  
it would ve been better if we d never met 
none of this would ve happened 
pocahontas  look at me 
i d rather die tomorrow   
than live a hundred years without knowing you 
pocahontas 
  i can t leave you 
  you never will 
no matter what happens to me 
i ll always be with you  forever 
help  somebody help 
help  help

  who got him 
  the savages 
  savages 
  they captured him  dragged him off 
  where d they take him 
  they headed north 
  how many were there 
  i don t know  at least a dozen 
  filthy beasts 
  ratcliffe was right 
it s perfect  wiggins 
i couldn t have planned this better myself 
the gold is as good as mine 
we ve got to save him 
he d do the same for any of us 
  thomas is right  we ve got to do somethin  
  and so we shall 
  i told you those savages couldn t be trusted 
  that s right 
smith tried to befriend them 
and look what they ve done to him 
  yeah  that s right 
  but now i say it s time to rescue our courageous comrade 
at daybreak  we attack 
what can you expect from filthy little heathens
  here s what you get when races are diverse

their skins are hellish red
they re only good when dead
they re vermin  as i said and worse

which means they must be evil
we must sound the drums of war
they re savages  savages
dirty shrieking devils
now we sound the drums of war
this is what we feared
the paleface is a demon
the only thing they feel at all is greed
beneath that milky hide there s empatiness inside
i wonder if they even bleed
  they re savages  savages
  barely even human
  savages  savages
  killers at the core
they re different from us
which means they can t be trusted
we must sound the drums of war

father  what will yours be 
my daughter speaks with
a wisdom beyond her years 
we have all come here with anger in our hearts   
but she comes with courage and understanding 
from this day forward 
if there is to be more killing   
it will not start with me

  good luck  lad 
  godspeed john 
  the crew a ready 
  aye  sir 
set the mainsails 
weigh anchor 
  let go of the topgallants 
  aye  sir 
lf i never knew you
lf i never felt this love
i would have no inkling of
how precious life can be
and i m so grateful to you
i d have lived my whole life through
lost forever
lf i never knew you
lf i never knew you
i d be safe but half as real
never knowing i could feel
a love so strong and true
  oh  if i never knew you
  there s no moment i d regret
  lf i never knew your love
  since the moment that we met
  i would have no inkling of
  lf our time has gone too fast
  how precious life can be
  i ve lived at last
yeah  yeah
i thought our love would be so beautiful
so beautiful
somehow we d make the whole world bright
i thought our love would be so beautiful
we d turn the darkness into light
and still my heart is saying we were right
we were right
  and if i never knew you
  lf i never knew you
i d have lived my whole life through
empty as the sky
never knowing why
lost forever
if i never knew
you
yeah
you think you own whatever land you land on
the earth is just a dead thing you can claim
but i know every rock and tree and creature
has a life  has a spirit
has a name
you think the only people
who are people
are the people who look
and think like you
but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
you ll learn things you never knew you never knew
have you ever heard the wolf cry
to the blue corn moon
or let the eagle tell you where he s been
can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
can you paint with all the colours of the wind
can you paint with all the colours of the wind
how high does the sycamore grow
lf you cut it down
then you ll never know
and you ll never hear the wolf cry
to the blue corn moon
for whether we are white or copapaer skinned
we need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
we need to paint with all the colours of the wind
you can own the earth and still
