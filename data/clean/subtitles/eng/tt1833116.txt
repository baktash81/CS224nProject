he would take advantage
of such polite exit 
i i was trying to avoid
bigger problems for vojtech 
an nypd cop just got killed
in new york

  you re fucked  koslow 
  wait  who the fuck is he 
   he s my boss  
we tried to close the case
on the general
and bury this whole mess 
but washington labelled
the case as weak
and took the embassy
off the table 
w w with all due respect  sir 
what the fuck you talkin 
about taking the embassy
off the table 
you just watched me
smuggle a dozen ki s
through polish diplomatic
pouches 
deal was to give you enough
evidence so you could
indict the general 
which i have fuckin 
over delivered at this point 
 look  i ve done my part  
i i want out 
agent wilcox here has a plan
to keep your status alive 
you should listen to her
and hope i like it
 cause in my book 
you re old news  my friend 
 wilcox   pete 
i think there s a way out of this  
we go along with
the general s plan 
evidence of fentanyl being
methodically distributed
inside a state prison
buries ryszard klimek for good 
and if that happens 
you re a free man 
 intense music 
the fuck you talking about 
go back to prison 
that was never part of the plan 
and where is the part
of the plan where you become
an accessory to the murder
of an undercover policeman 
how am i an accessory
when i try to help him 
i mean  it s all on the tape 
and you guys put me there 
if i inform the nypd
that i m working with a witness
to officer daniel gomez s murder
you will be exposed 
if you re exposed 
general s case falls apart 
if i say no 
prosecutor will have
you serve the remaining
twelve years of your sentence
and then tack on
whatever the nypd pins on you 
 music continues 
 scoffs 
some fuckin  bullshit 
i tried to help him 
you re a convicted felon who was
present when one of their own
was nearly beheaded 
you should think
of your family  pete 
look  once you re in charge
like the general wants
you just build a list
of all the inmates
and cos distributing for him 
 everyone s a potential nail
to crucify 
 that son of a bitch  
i need to know you re in 
 music continues 
and let me guess 
if i fuck up and bail
then i m alone  right 
don t fuck up 
 scoffs

peter koslow 
 decorated vet

fast tracked almost smells
like a bogus parole violation 
back into bale hill 
same prison he was serving
20 years for murder
before somebody pulled him out
pending the investigation
of new evidence 
anyway  i want to know
why your subordinate s name
keeps popping up around
this admittedly suspicious
motherfuckin  file 
i m sure that  uh 
agent wilcox s name pops up
on a number of case files 
detective 
you should check with the dea 
they just sent me here 
 wilcox   look  if i was involved
in the kind of pro active operation 
that you are suggesting 
i would be intimately acquainted
with  uh  peter 
what was his name again 
koslow

professional courtesy we can 
there s koslow
right after gomez was killed

 that s y all leaving
the scene

i went from being the wife
of a great father
