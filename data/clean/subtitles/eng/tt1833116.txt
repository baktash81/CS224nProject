the buyer was a cop
earlier in the conversation

you thought by kicking
and pushing him to the ground
he would take advantage
of such polite exit
ii was trying to avoid
bigger problems for vojtech
an nypd cop just got killed
in new york
do you know
what that means piotr
bad business
they will shut down
all illegal activities
until they find
their cop killer
now stazek
doesnt have documents

we tried to close the case
on the general
and bury this whole mess
but washington labelled
the case as weak
and took the embassy
off the table
wwwith all due respect sir
what the fuck you talkin
about taking the embassy
off the table
you just watched me
smuggle a dozen kis
through polish diplomatic
pouches
deal was to give you enough
evidence so you could
indict the general
which i have fuckin
overdelivered at this point
look ive done my part
ii want out
agent wilcox here has a plan
to keep your status alive
you should listen to her
and hope i like it
cause in my book
youre old news my friend
wilcox pete
i think theres a way out of this
we go along with
the generals plan
evidence of fentanyl being
methodically distributed
inside a state prison
buries ryszard klimek for good
and if that happens
youre a free man
intense music
the fuck you talking about
go back to prison
that was never part of the plan
and where is the part
of the plan where you become
an accessory to the murder
of an undercover policeman
how am i an accessory
when i try to help him
i mean its all on the tape
and you guys put me there
if i inform the nypd
that im working with a witness
to officer daniel gomezs murder
you will be exposed
if youre exposed
generals case falls apart
if i say no
prosecutor will have
you serve the remaining
twelve years of your sentence
and then tack on
whatever the nypd pins on you
music continues
scoffs
some fuckin bullshit
i tried to help him
youre a convicted felon who was
present when one of their own
was nearly beheaded
you should think
of your family pete

like the general wants
you just build a list
of all the inmates
and cos distributing for him
everyones a potential nail
to crucify
that son of a bitch
