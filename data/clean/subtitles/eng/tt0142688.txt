theyre no use to father not anymore
not since hes been this way
his library was his whole world
now its just a painful memory
unbearably painful
i understand
well at a rough preliminary estimate
you have a collection here
worth around 600000
six hundred thousand
yes or thereabouts
ive picked out one or two volumes
that merit special attention
this persiles for example is important
id hang on to that
it will never depreciate
its a good investment
valuable
very valuable
as for this hypnerotomachia di poliphili
by colonna venice 1545
im sure i could find you a buyer
but i wouldnt let the rest go
for less than 500000
under any circumstances
it may take a month to place them
in the meantime
i advise you to be patient
a month
yes a month or two
it depends on how much
of a hurry youre in
you see more hurry less money
of course
well thats my advice anyway
im sure you wouldnt
want to rush things
but please feel free
to consult another expert
if you have any questions
you know where to reach me
incidentally this fourvolume edition
of don quixote is quite nice
but not particularly valuable
now i could take it off your hands
right away
how much were you thinking of
i couldnt go more
than 4000 4200 tops
fine
you here
hello witkin
you didnt waste much time
theres a small fortune in there
help yourself
youre a vulture corso a vulture
who isnt in our business
youd stoop to anything
for a quixote by ybarra
you bet i would
unscrupulous
thoroughly unscrupulous
happy hunting
i just got off the phone with witkin
hes spitting blood
really whats his problem
he said youre a doubledealing
moneygrubbing bastard
thought he had that deal sewed up
he said you queered his pitch
well he shouldve been
quicker off the mark
may i
sure and he said your evaluation
was way over the top
got those people coming out in a rash
now theyre asking twice
what those books are worth
lets face it you screwed him
thats what its called
yes
he also said
that you snatched the don qui
ybarra don quixote 1780
all four volumes
son of a bitch
fantastic
fantastic you are the best
that client of yours the swiss
you think hed still be interested in this
i have witkin on my ass i told him
i had no part of this operation
except 10 percent
20 percent the swiss was my client
no deal
fifteen for my childrens sake
you dont have any children
im still young give me time
ten
hey man how you doing
how about a couple of bucks
not today not today
hey
and earlier in 1580
in de la demonomanie des sorciers
by the frenchman jean bodin
bodin was probably the first
to attempt to establish a system
if the term system may be applied
to the middle ages
for classifying
the contemporary perceptions of evil
in bodin we find one of the first definitions
of the word witch
and i quote
a witch is a person who
though cognizant of the laws of god
endeavors to act through
the medium of a pact with the devil
to assist them in their work
many witches kept familiars
that is to say
creatures such as cats or toads
in which supernatural spirits or demons
were thought to reside
for those of you ladies and gentlemen
who wish to delve more deeply
into the controversial subject
of witchcraft
a great deal of relevant information
may be found in the following works
nicolas remes demonolattia libri
and compendium maleficarum
by francesco maria guazzo
i see you were stimulated
by my little talk mr corso
did i snore
well its nice of you to ask
no not that i noticed
shall we go
dont you sleep nights
like a baby
strange
id have bet a brace
of gutenberg bibles
you spend half the night
with your eyes peeled
youre one of those lean
hungry restless types
that put the wind up julius caesar
men who stab their friends in the back
not i suspect that you have many friends
do you mr corso
your kind seldom does
that makes woo of us
youre right of course
your friendships dont concern me
in the least
our relations have always been strictly
commercial and thats the way i like it
the professional and the personal
should be mutually exclusive
listen i came here to do some business
not shoot the breeze
if you wanna expound
your personal philosophies
write another book
you dont like me do you
i dont have to like you
youre a client and you pay well
youre privileged mr corso
very few people ever set foot in here
this is my private collection
some bibliophiles specialize
in gothic novels
others in books of hours
all my own rare editions
have the same protagonist
the devil
may i take a look
yes
its why i brought you here
beautiful arent they
the soft sheen the superb gilding
not to mention the centuries of wisdom
they contain
i know people who would kill
for a collection like this
the ars diavoli
youll never see as many books
on the subject anywhere else in the world
theyre the rarest
the choicest editions in existence
its taken me a lifetime
to assemble them
only the supreme masterpiece
was missing
come
the nine gates
of the kingdom of shadows
youre familiar with it
yes
venice 1666
the author and printer aristide torchia
was burned by the holy lnquisition
together with all his works
only three copies survived
one
catalog lists three copies surviving
in private ownership
fargas the kessler and the telfer
its true
you know your business
but youre mistaken nonetheless
according to my own research
only one is authentic
well three are known
thats the trouble
whered you get it
i bought it from telfer
telfer
yes he finally sold it to me
the day before he killed himself
its good timing
silence is golden
precisely
ever heard of the delomelanicon
ive heard of it yes its a myth isnt it
a book reputed to have been written
by satan himself
no myth
that book existed
torchia actually acquired it
the engravings you are now admiring
were adapted
by torchia from the delomelanicon
they form a kind of satanic riddle
correctly interpreted
with the aid of the original text
and sufficient inside information
theyre reputed to conjure up
the prince of darkness in person
you dont say
are you a religious man mr corso
i mean do you believe
in the supernatural
i believe in my percentage
dont you get dizzy standing there
what is it that you want
from me balkan
i want you to go to europe
and investigate
the other two copies are
in portugal and france
i want you to find some way
of comparing them with mine
every page every engraving
the binding everything
im convinced only one is authentic
i wanna know which
that could be an expensive trip
thats to get you started
spend what you need
what if i find that your copys a forgery
its quite possible
really
it doesnt appear to be
even the paper sounds kosher
even so
theres something wrong
you mean the devil wont show up
if all three copies turn out to be bogus
or incomplete your work will be done
if on the other hand
one of them turns out to be genuine
ill finance you further
i want you to get it for me
at all costs never mind how
never mind how sounds illegal
wouldnt be the first time
youve done something illegal
not that illegal
hence the size of the check
do a good job ill double it
gotta be something wrong with it
if youre letting it out of your hands
i have the utmost faith in you
mr corso
nothing more reliable than a man whose
loyalty can be bought for hard cash
good morning im dean corso
im terribly sorry to disturb you
at a time like this
it would be very helpful maam
if you could tell me what you know
about this book
isnt this one of my husbands books
right
it was in his collection until very recently
he sold it to a client of mine
im trying to authenticate it
he sold it you say
strange this was one of
his most treasured possessions
he never mentioned the sale
no
its news to me
who bought it
a private collector
may i know his name
im afraid thats confidential
i suppose he has a bill of sale
no problem there
is this your job
authenticating rare books
and tracking them down yes
youre a book detective
kind of
do you recall when and where
your husband acquired this book
in spain
we were vacationing at toledo
andrew got very excited
he paid a great deal of money for it
he was a fanatical collector
so i gather
ill show you
its impressive
andrew used to spend many hours
in here
too many
did he ever try it out
i dont understand
the book
did he ever use it to perform
some kind of ritual
intended to produce
a supernatural effect
are you serious
yes absolutely
andrew was a trifle eccentric
mr corso
but he wasnt insane
its true hed been acting
strangely those last few days
he shut himself up in here
he seldom emerged except for meals
that morning i was awoken
by the screams of the maid
hed hanged himself
whatever he was up to
i certainly cant see him chanting
mumbo jumbo or trying to raise the dead
the devil mrs telfer
this book is designed to raise the devil
thus let the light shine
son of a bitch where did you get this
balkan
wants me to research it
balkan owns a nine gates
recently acquired
from the late lamented andrew telfer
trust balkan
what does he need you for
i dont suppose he plans to sell it
he wants me to compare it
with the two surviving copies
which are in portugal and france
so im off to europe
compare it
yeah only one of threes authentic
he says
well this looks genuine enough
christ its gotta be worth a million
take care of it
thats why im here
i need you to stash it for me
because im starting to see things
like what
uninvited visitors unfamiliar faces
i dont trust anyone not even balkan
come to think of it
im not even sure i trust you
you know i wouldnt screw you
unless there was a good reason
money women business
other than that you can relax
ill pick it up on my way to the airport
sure
these engravings are terrific
or horrific whichever
sensational absolutely sensational
may i come in
please sit down
ive come to talk business
yesterday when you came to see me
about that book
i was too surprised to react
as i shouldve done
i mean it really was one
of andrews favorites
so you said
id like to get it back
that could be a problem
not necessarily it all depends
on what
on you
i dont understand mrs telfer
the book is not mine to dispose of
you work for money i take it
what else
i have a great deal of money
im very happy for you
you could stage a theft
i imagine your client is well insured
im a professional maam
a professional mercenary
mercenaries work for the highest bidder
i make a living
i could throw in a bonus
this has happened before someplace
i know in the movies
and she had an automatic
in her stocking
no automatic
would you like a drink
why not
okay where is it
wheres what
dont fuck with me
i thought i already did
wait no no wait wait wait

jesus christ

mr corso what have you got for me
more than i bargained for
what do you mean

you never let me down before

ornstein
yeah
the dealer

because of the book
what else
well i never said it would be easy
if its a question of money
it isnt the money i want out
this matter means a great deal to me
mr corso
im not an ungenerous man
you know that
proceed as arranged and you can
tack another zero onto your fee
final call for passengers
traveling to paris
hey where are you balkan
balkan
do you speak english
yes i do
i would like to get your opinion on this
what a habit for a bookbinder
the nine gates superb edition
very rare the telfer copy
yes you used to own it right
we used to yes
sold it
we sold it when the opportunity
presented itself
it was too good to
too good to miss
an excellent sale
an excellent buy
impeccable condition
impeccable
are you the present owner
no a client of mine
i would never have believed
she would part with it never
she
mrs telfer
i understood that it was
mr telfer that had bought it
he paid for it
it was mrs telfer who made him buy it
he didnt seem particularly
interested
an exceptional specimen
do you think it could be a forgery
forgery
you hear that pablo
i took you for a professional
you speak too lightly of forgeries
far too lightly
forging a book is very expensive
paper of the period right inks
too expensive to be profitable
still it can be done
of course
requires a great skill
but yes it can be done
do you think
that could be the case here
what makes you ask
my client wishes to satisfy himself
on the books authenticity
his name is balkan
boris balkan of new york
all books have a destiny of their own
and a life of their own
mr balkan is a celebrated collector
hes no fool
he must know this book
is authentic
we know it
so must he
we had this book for years
many years
and ample opportunity
to study it thoroughly
the printing the binding
are magnificent examples
of 17th century
venetian craftsmanship
finest rag paper
resistant to the passage of time
none of your modern wood pulp
watermarks ink typefaces
if this is a forgery
or a copy with missing pages restored
its the work of a master
a master
yes
have you studied the engravings
they seem to have
some underlying significance
but of course here for example
this one could be interpreted
as a warning
venture too far it seems to say and
danger will descend on you from above
these type of books
often contain little puzzles
especially in the case
of such an illustrious collaborator
collaborator
you could not have proceeded
very far in your research señor
here look close
now you see
only six of the nine engravings
were signed by aristide torchia
yes and the other three
this is one of them
lcf
whos lcf
think
lucifer
very perceptive of you señor
torchia was burned alive
because he wrote this book
in collaboration with someone else
come on you cant honestly believe
the man who wrote this book
did so in alliance with the devil
and went to the stake for it
even hell has its heroes señor
ive seen you before
have you
yes
are you traveling in this car
the next one
the sleeper
i travel on the cheap
youre a student
something like that
i like trains
trains im on
just trains
whats your name
guess
green eyes
thatll do
whats yours
corso
strange name
italian it means run
you dont look like a runner to me
more the quiet type
well give my regards to balkan
tell him im doing my best
balkan
never mind
see you around
maybe
i wouldnt be surprised
yes dean corso mr fargas
corso oh yes please come in
thank you
please
home sweet home
you wont say no to a brandy i take it
thank you very much
thank you
what handsome glasses
theyre the only ones i have left
thanks
mustve been a beautiful place
it was
but old families
are like ancient civilizations
they wither and die
there they are 834 our of them
a pity you didnt see them
in better times
i used to have 5000
but these are the survivors
so this is the fargas collection
not quite as i imagined it i must say
cest la vie my friend
but i keep them in perfect condition
safe from damp light heat rats
i dust and air them every day
these are the occult
what do you think
not bad
not bad indeed
at least 10 of them are extremely rare
here
plancys dictionnaire infernal
first edition 1844
leonardo fioravantis
compendio de secreti 1571
and there it is
in perfect condition
it has traveled the
world for three and a half centuries
yet it mightve been printed yesterday
is it in order i mean you havent
detected anything unusual
unusual no
the text is complete the engravings too
nine plus the title page
just as the catalog states
just like kessler in paris
and telfer in new york
yes it isnt the telfer anymore
telfer killed himself
but he sold his copy
to boris balkan first
balkan
if he sets his heart on a book
no price is too high
not that i would ever sell this one
not at any price
its
its strange that he
shouldve sent you here
if he already had
you have it here
may i see it
superb
beautiful
identical
two of the only three
to escape the flames
reunited for the first time
in over three centuries
yes
look at this slight imperfection here
the damaged s
the same type the same impression
incredible
you see
if it werent for this slight discoloration
on the back of your copy
no one could tell them apart
if you dont mind id like to stay for a while
and examine them in detail
what are you looking for mr corso
im not quite sure
some books are dangerous
not to be opened with impunity
thats very true
ill be damned
hello again
you didnt say you were bound for sintra
neither did you
what are you doing here
reading
i can see that
and bumping into people
unexpectedly
yes unexpectedly is right
are you on a business trip
is that why you always carry
that thing around
is this part of your course
my course
winning friends and influencing people
you said you were a student
did i
so i am in a way
i like books
do you
have you been traveling long
a while
i dont suppose you
ever travel by motorbike
excuse me señor
for me youre sure
the phone sir
yes
mr corso
my god howd you find me
made any progress
progress yeah you could call it that
well
i cant talk here im in the lobby
let me call you back where are you
never mind that get them
to transfer it to your room ill wait
all right
señor pardon me could you
send this up to my room please
yes
thank you
still there
yes
all right
ive examined the fargas copy
its authentic enough
at least it looks that way
its like yours
but there are discrepancies
discrepancies
the engravings theyre not identical
its like keys in different hands
doorways open in one copy
and bricked up in the other
and theres another thing
yes
yes go on
ones that differ arent signed torchia
theyre signed lcf
still there
lcf
listen where are you anyway
i must have that copy mr corso
get it for me
the old man wouldnt sell it
to save his life he said as much
did he
hello
just a minute
yeah
what time is it
early but you have to go
go go where
the fargas place
ive already seen fargas
i think you should see him again
what is this some kind of practical joke
who are you
what do you know about fargas
get dressed ill wait for you outside
dont bother he isnt there
oh really then where is he
over there
god almighty
wanna get inside
i had thought about it yes
you wait here
shit
well did you find it
you know its come to my attention
that you know too goddamn much
why do you keep following me around
youre wasting time asking questions
better get out of here theres
a flight from lisbon to paris at noon
we should just make it
whats with the we
there are two of us arent there
what happened back there
the old man caught someone stealing
i guess
what do you guess happened to him
he drowned
with a little help from who
hes dead who cares
i do
i could easily wind up the same way
not with me around to look after you
oh i see
youre my guardian angel then
if you say so
someones playing a game with me
of course youre a part of it
and youre getting to like it
hello gruber
hello mr corso
delighted to see you again
we dont have any vacancies
but im sure ill be able
to organize something
thank you very much
thank you
good afternoon
im dean corso i have an appointment
with baroness kessler
this way
you have 30 minutes
yes
monsieur corso
oh yes mr corso come in
ive heard a great deal about you
nothing good i hope
you hope right
well im reassured baroness
because in my trade
to be spoken well of
can be professionally disastrous
my god
yes there it is
the kessler collection
i know your catalog almost by heart
strange we havent met before
your name is a byword
among dealers and collectors
but i imagine you know
your own reputation better than i do
yes well it does keep the wolf
from the door so to speak
sorry were you
in the middle of something
my latest work the devil history
and myth a kind of biography
it will be published early next year
why the devil
i saw him one day
i was 15 years old
and i saw him as plain as i see you now
it was love at first sight
you know 300 years ago
youd have been burned at the stake
for saying something like that
i wouldnt have said it
nor would i have made
a million by writing about it
yeah
what is it you wish to discuss
mr corso
theres a book in your collection
id like to examine if possible
the nine gates
of the kingdom of shadows
the nine gates an interesting work
everyones been asking me
about it lately
is that so
follow me
do you truly believe
in the devil baroness
enough to devote my life
and my library to him
not to mention many years of work
dont you
almost
this book demands
a certain amount of faith
im afraid my faith
is in short supply these days
i know this work extremely well
ive studied it for years
do you have any doubts
about its authenticity
none whatsoever
youre sure
my knowledge of this book is profound
i wrote a biography of its author
yes ive read it
aristide torchia
the devils apprentice excellent work
a courageous man
he died for the sake
of this very book in 1667
while studying the black arts in prague
he acquired a copy
of the dread delomelanicon
this is torchias adaptation of that work
which was written by lucifer himself
after they burned him at the stake
a secret society was founded
to perpetuate its memory
and preserve its secrets
the order of the silver serpent
a sect
a kind of witches coven
for centuries
they have met to read from this book
and worship the prince of darkness
today they have degenerated
into a social club
for bored millionaires and celebrities
who use its meetings
as an excuse to indulge
their jaded sexual appetites
i myself belonged to the order
years ago
but time is too precious at my age
besides my orgy days are over
i told them to go to the devil
you mean its all about sex or
of course not
they are under the illusion
that they owe their money and success
to membership in the order
do they still meet
every year
on the anniversary of torchias death
theyll be meeting very soon now
and you say they read from this book
not this one
i took mine back when liana telfer
acquired the one in toledo
victor fargas is a nonbeliever
hes always refused to participate
so naturally they use the telfer copy
not that it has ever worked
did andrew telfer ever take part
telfer
no no
that creature liana
married him for his money
she comes of an old
and aristocratic french family
the saint martins
but they were penniless
so liana used his dollars
to restore her chateau
and buy the nine gates
if he ever finds out what his wife
gets up to at these gatherings
hell probably kill himself
funny you should say that baroness
he hanged himself last week
who exactly
are you working for mr corso
my clients name is irrelevant baroness
im simply trying to authenticate his copy
the one that telfer sold him
before he died
how stupid of me
i should have guessed
youve outstayed your welcome
mr corso
i was hoping to examine
your copy in detail
certainly not
tell your client
who can only be boris balkan
to come and examine it himself
if he dares
tell him not to send any more
wolves in sheeps clothing
now kindly leave
im sorry if i have troubled you
thank you very much for your time
you dont know what youre
getting yourself into mr corso
get out before its too late
im afraid it already is baroness
good day
theyre broken
you should be more careful
i need a favor gruber
certainly mr corso
liana telfer
maiden name de saint martin
40ish brunette dishy
probably accompanied by
a black gentleman with closely cropped
platinum blond hair and a mustache
i wanna know if theyre staying
at some hotel here
take a little time
yes of course
start with the fivestars
thats your best bet
very well sir
all right
are you feeling all right
ive felt better gruber thanks
let me know if you locate them
put this against the back of your neck
you were really great down there
by the river
i havent thanked you for that
all right look
i think its about time you told me
whats going on here
someones after your book
no kidding
and you where do you fit into it
yeah
theres a call for you
may i take it in reception please
all right ill be right down
yes
anything new
oh his masters voice again
no not much aside from the fact
that someones tried to take my life
a couple of times
oh yes fargas has been murdered
murdered how do you know
i saw him and his copy
or what was left of it anyway
someone had snatched the engravings
and tried to burn the rest
what do you make of it
thats tragic its tragic
what about baroness kessler
how did you get on today
where exactly are you
what about her copy
no why do i get the impression
that youve been
down my neck the entire time
youre an investment of mine mr corso
im merely looking after it
the old woman swears
her copys authentic
but i didnt get a chance
to examine it closely
she threw me out as soon as she
guessed that you were behind my visit
you arent exactly in her good books
if you know what i mean
you must see her again
what are you kidding
have you seen her secretary
try the lunch break
hello
do you have a photocopy machine
back there
oh yes monsieur
may i use it
of course monsieur
yes hello baroness its me
the wolf in sheeps clothing
i thought i made myself quite clear
mr corso
well ive got something
for you baroness
a kind of peace offering
will you allow me to give it to you
please
first let me apologize
i shouldve told you right away
that im working for boris balkan
it was foolish of me to think that i could
deceive someone as astute as yourself
so please forgive me
flattery will get you nowhere mr corso
get on with it
right
these
are for you
what is this
what is this supposed to be
you said that your knowledge
of the nine gates was extensive
but did you ever compare your copy
with the other two
no
why
well you should
these are copies of the engravings
in balkans book
youll find that some of them differ
from yours
differ
so you question my books authenticity
do you
if thats your peace offering
you can take it and go
my nine gates is absolutely genuine
i dont dispute that baroness
in my opinion
all three copies are genuine
but the fact remains
they display variations
variations
if that were true
it would be a revelation
what makes you so sure
ive already compared these
with the fargas engravings
and in his book
the keys were in the other hand
here the doorway wasnt bricked up
and in this one
the man was hanging by the other leg
well
well what
look closely baroness
the turrets
three in yours
four in balkans
amazing
im convinced therell be a third one
in here somewhere
three variations in three copies
makes nine
coincidence or something more
maybe torchia hid the secret
of the ninth gate in three books not one
i must admit im impressed
this puts an entirely different complexion
on the matter
you have my permission
to investigate further mr corso
take as long as you need
my permission did not extend
to that mr corso
nobody smokes in my library
baroness
excuse me theres something missing
from my room
has anyone been up there
while i was out
only your wife monsieur
my wife i dont have a wife
excuse me monsieur
for you sir
yes
what news
news
let me see
well
yes the good news is that i got to
examine the old womans book
and three of her engravings
were signed lcf
the bad news is that someone strangled
her and made a bonfire of her collection
now thats tragic wouldnt you say
you took the words out my mouth
yes its the fargas story all over again
im of the mind
that they tore out the engravings
before they torched the place
that makes two sets theyve got
and my copy
well i learned my lesson fortunately
i dont carry it around with me anymore
otherwise it mightve gone up
in smoke
excellent good thinking
well with two copies gone
that seems to conclude
your assignment
it only remains for you
to return my book
im staying at the ritz you can
pick up your check at the same time
shall we say in half an hour

the book you stole from my room
that book is mine

you stay here and cover me
im going down
whos that
mumbo jumbo mumbo jumbo
mumbo jumbo
look around you all of you
what do you see
a bunch of buffoons in fancy dress
think the prince of darkness
would actually deign to manifest himself
before the likes of you
he never has and he never will
never
you read from his book
but you have no conception
of its true power
i alone have grasped its secret
i alone have fathomed
the masters grand design
i alone am worthy to enjoy the fruits
of that discovery
absolute power
to determine my own destiny
youre insane boris
give it back to me
you liana de saint martin
youre even guiltier than the rest
of this pathetic rabble
you have at least some idea of what
this book can do in the right hands
yet you lend yourself
to these farcical proceedings
these orgies of aging flesh
conducted in the masters name
youre a charlatan
dont corso dont
let it be
what is it with you
he just murdered someone in public
youre off the hook
for the other killings
you should be grateful
im ecstatic
youre out of a job its over
what more do you want
you know what
not taking me for a ride
you were working for him all along
funny i thought you were
shit
yes
thats it
precisely
all is in readiness
one
four
three six seven
five eight woo nine
the enigma is solved at last
to travel in silence
by a long and circuitous route
to brave the arrows of misfortune
and fear neither noose nor fire
to play the greatest of all games
and win foregoing no expense
is to mock the vicissitudes of fate
and gain at last the key
that will unlock
the ninth gate
corso
what were you expecting
an apparition
youre not wanted here mr corso
leave
im the only apparition
youll see tonight
youll find a check waiting
at my new york office
payment in full
you killed for those
theyre worth more than money
infinitely more
but they happen to be mine
not yours
you know something corso
in spite of our differences
i have a soft spot for you
im touched
we have something in common
we share the same passion
youve developed the same obsession
havent you
unfortunately for you
only one of us is destined to fulfill it
youre out of your depth kindly go
im not leaving here emptyhanded
dont even think about it
stand aside
i credited you with more finesse
you heard me stand back
put that away its not your style
it seems youve found your proper niche
at last
i like that
now
you can watch
im entering uncharted territory
taking the road that leads to equality
with god
you cant come with me
i must travel alone
but you may look on
and marvel
thats very kind of you
indeed it is
there have been men
who have been burned alive
or disemboweled
for just a glimpse
of what you are about to witness
i give you my allegiance master
i pledge myself to you body and soul
let me fear neither noose
nor fire nor poison
erase me from the book of life
inscribe me
in the black book of death
admit me to the ninth gate
let it be so
let it be so now
yes
i feel the power surge through me
like an electric current
rendering me capable of any feat
of mind or body
im invulnerable
im invincible
i could float on air
i could walk on water
behold
i plunge my hands in fire
i feel no heat
thats just great give us another one
its miraculous
i feel nothing nothing at all
is that it
is the game over
for balkan yes
not for you
why didnt it work for balkan
the ninth engraving was a forgery
wheres the real one
