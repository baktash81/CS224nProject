  they re no use to father  not anymore 
not since he s been this way 
his library was his whole world 
now it s just a painful memory 
unbearably painful 
i understand 
well  at a rough preliminary estimate 
you have a collection here   
   worth around  600 000 
six hundred thousand 
yes  or thereabouts 
i ve picked out one or two volumes
that merit special attention 
this persiles  for example  is important 
i d hang on to that 
it will never depreciate 
it s a good investment 
  valuable 
  very valuable 
as for this hypnerotomachia di poliphili
by colonna  venice 1545   
   i m sure i could find you a buyer 
but i wouldn t let the rest go
for less than  500 000   
   under any circumstances 
it may take a month to place them 
in the meantime 
i advise you to be patient 
  a month 
  yes  a month or two 
it depends on how much
of a hurry you re in 
you see  more hurry  less money 
  of course 
  well  that s my advice anyway 
i m sure you wouldn t
want to rush things   
   but please feel free
to consult another expert 
if you have any questions 
you know where to reach me 
incidentally  this four volume edition
of don quixote is quite nice   
   but not particularly valuable 
now  i could take it off your hands   
   right away 
how much were you thinking of 
i couldn t go more
than 4000  4200  tops 
fine 
  you here 
  hello  witkin 
you didn t waste much time 
there s a small fortune in there 
help yourself 
you re a vulture  corso  a vulture 
who isn t  in our business 
you d stoop to anything 
for a quixote by ybarra 
you bet i would 
unscrupulous 
thoroughly unscrupulous 
happy hunting 
i just got off the phone with witkin 
he s spitting blood 
really  what s his problem 
he said you re a double dealing 
money grubbing bastard 
thought he had that deal sewed up 
he said you queered his pitch 
well  he should ve been
quicker off the mark 
may i 
sure  and he said your evaluation
was way over the top 
got those people coming out in a rash 
now they re asking twice
what those books are worth 
let s face it  you screwed him 
  that s what it s called 
  yes 
he also said
that you snatched the don qui   
ybarra  don quixote  1780 
all four volumes 
son of a bitch 
fantastic 
fantastic  you are the best 
that client of yours  the swiss 
you think he d still be interested in this 
i have witkin on my ass  i told him
i had no part of this operation 
except 10 percent 
20 percent  the swiss was my client 
  no deal 
  fifteen  for my children s sake 
  you don t have any children 
  i m still young  give me time 
ten 
hey  man  how you doing 
how about a couple of bucks 
not today  not today 
hey 
and earlier  in 1580 
in de la demonomanie des sorciers   
   by the frenchman  jean bodin 
bodin was probably the first
to attempt to establish a system   
   if the term  system  may be applied
to the middle ages   
   for classifying
the contemporary perceptions of evil 
in bodin  we find one of the first definitions
of the word  witch  
and i quote 
 a witch is a person who 
though cognizant of the laws of god   
   endeavors to act through
the medium of a pact with the devil  
to assist them in their work 
many witches kept familiars 
that is to say 
creatures such as cats or toads   
   in which supernatural spirits or demons
were thought to reside 
for those of you ladies and gentlemen
who wish to delve more deeply   
   into the controversial subject
of witchcraft   
   a great deal of relevant information
may be found in the following works 
nicolas remes  demonolattia libri   
   and compendium maleficarum
by francesco maria guazzo 
i see you were stimulated
by my little talk  mr  corso 
  did i snore 
  well  it s nice of you to ask 
no  not that i noticed 
shall we go 
don t you sleep nights 
  like a baby 
  strange 
i d have bet a brace
of gutenberg bibles   
   you spend half the night
with your eyes peeled 
you re one of those lean 
hungry  restless types   
   that put the wind up julius caesar 
men who stab their friends in the back 
not  i suspect  that you have many friends 
do you  mr  corso 
your kind seldom does 
that makes woo of us 
you re right  of course 
your friendships don t concern me
in the least 
our relations have always been strictly
commercial and that s the way i like it 
the professional and the personal
should be mutually exclusive 
listen  i came here to do some business 
not shoot the breeze 
if you wanna expound
your personal philosophies   
   write another book 
  you don t like me  do you 
  i don t have to like you 
you re a client and you pay well 
you re privileged  mr  corso 
very few people ever set foot in here 
this is my private collection 
some bibliophiles specialize
in gothic novels   
   others in books of hours 
all my own rare editions
have the same protagonist 
the devil 
  may i take a look 
  yes 
it s why i brought you here 
beautiful  aren t they 
the soft sheen  the superb gilding 
not to mention the centuries of wisdom
they contain 
i know people who would kill
for a collection like this 
the ars diavoli 
you ll never see as many books
on the subject anywhere else in the world 
they re the rarest 
the choicest editions in existence 
it s taken me a lifetime
to assemble them 
only the supreme masterpiece
was missing 
come 
the nine gates
of the kingdom of shadows 
  you re familiar with it 
  yes 
venice  1666 
the author and printer  aristide torchia 
was burned by the holy lnquisition   
   together with all his works 
only three copies survived 
one 
catalog lists three copies surviving
in private ownership 
  fargas  the kessler and the telfer 
  it s true 
you know your business 
but you re mistaken nonetheless 
according to my own research 
only one is authentic 
well  three are known 
that s the trouble 
where d you get it 
i bought it from telfer 
  telfer 
  yes  he finally sold it to me 
the day before he killed himself 
it s good timing 
  silence is golden 
  precisely 
ever heard of the delomelanicon 
i ve heard of it  yes  it s a myth  isn t it 
a book reputed to have been written
by satan himself 
no myth 
that book existed 
torchia actually acquired it 
the engravings you are now admiring
were adapted   
   by torchia from the delomelanicon 
they form a kind of satanic riddle 
correctly interpreted
with the aid of the original text   
   and sufficient inside information   
   they re reputed to conjure up
the prince of darkness in person 
you don t say 
are you a religious man  mr  corso 
i mean  do you believe
in the supernatural 
i believe in my percentage 
don t you get dizzy standing there 
what is it that you want
from me  balkan 
i want you to go to europe
and investigate 
the other two copies are
in portugal and france 
i want you to find some way
of comparing them with mine 
every page  every engraving 
the binding  everything 
i m convinced only one is authentic 
i wanna know which 
that could be an expensive trip 
that s to get you started 
spend what you need 
what if i find that your copy s a forgery 
it s quite possible 
really 
it doesn t appear to be 
  even the paper sounds kosher 
  even so 
  there s something wrong 
  you mean the devil won t show up 
if all three copies turn out to be bogus
or incomplete  your work will be done 
if  on the other hand 
one of them turns out to be genuine   
   i ll finance you further 
i want you to get it for me 
at all costs  never mind how 
   never mind how  sounds illegal 
  wouldn t be the first time   
   you ve done something illegal 
  not that illegal 
  hence the size of the check 
do a good job  i ll double it 
gotta be something wrong with it
if you re letting it out of your hands 
i have the utmost faith in you 
mr  corso 
nothing more reliable than a man whose
loyalty can be bought for hard cash 
good morning  i m dean corso 
i m terribly sorry to disturb you
at a time like this 
it would be very helpful  ma am 
if you could tell me what you know   
   about this book 
  isn t this one of my husband s books 
  right 
it was in his collection until very recently 
he sold it to a client of mine 
i m trying to authenticate it 
he sold it  you say 
strange  this was one of
his most treasured possessions 
  he never mentioned the sale 
  no 
it s news to me 
who bought it 
a private collector 
may i know his name 
i m afraid that s confidential 
i suppose he has a bill of sale 
  no problem there 
  is this your job 
authenticating rare books 
and tracking them down  yes 
you re a book detective 
kind of 
do you recall when and where
your husband acquired this book 
in spain 
we were vacationing at toledo 
andrew got very excited 
he paid a great deal of money for it 
he was a fanatical collector 
so i gather 
i ll show you 
it s impressive 
andrew used to spend many hours
in here 
too many 
did he ever try it out 
i don t understand 
the book 
did he ever use it to perform
some kind of ritual   
   intended to produce
a supernatural effect 
are you serious 
yes  absolutely 
andrew was a trifle eccentric 
mr  corso   
   but he wasn t insane 
it s true he d been acting   
   strangely those last few days 
he shut himself up in here 
he seldom emerged except for meals 
that morning  i was awoken   
   by the screams of the maid 
he d hanged himself 
whatever he was up to   
   i certainly can t see him chanting
mumbo jumbo or trying to raise the dead 
the devil  mrs  telfer 
this book is designed to raise the devil 
thus let the light shine 
son of a bitch  where did you get this 
balkan 
wants me to research it 
balkan owns a nine gates 
recently acquired
from the late lamented andrew telfer 
trust balkan 
what does he need you for 
i don t suppose he plans to sell it 
he wants me to compare it
with the two surviving copies   
   which are in portugal and france 
  so i m off to europe 
  compare it 
yeah  only one of three s authentic 
he says 
well  this looks genuine enough 
christ  it s gotta be worth a million 
  take care of it 
  that s why i m here 
i need you to stash it for me 
  because i m starting to see things 
  like what 
uninvited visitors  unfamiliar faces 
i don t trust anyone  not even balkan 
come to think of it 
i m not even sure i trust you 
you know i wouldn t screw you
unless there was a good reason 
money  women  business 
other than that  you can relax 
  i ll pick it up on my way to the airport 
  sure 
these engravings are terrific 
or horrific  whichever 
sensational  absolutely sensational 
may i come in 
please  sit down 
i ve come to talk business 
yesterday  when you came to see me
about that book   
   i was too surprised to react
as i should ve done 
i mean  it really was one
of andrew s favorites 
so you said 
i d like to get it back 
  that could be a problem 
  not necessarily  it all depends 
  on what 
  on you 
i don t understand  mrs  telfer 
the book is not mine to dispose of 
you work for money  i take it 
  what else 
  i have a great deal of money 
  i m very happy for you 
  you could stage a theft 
i imagine your client is well insured 
  i m a professional  ma am 
  a professional mercenary 
  mercenaries work for the highest bidder 
  i make a living 
i could throw in a bonus 
  this has happened before someplace 
  i know  in the movies 
and she had an automatic
in her stocking 
no automatic 
  would you like a drink 
  why not 
okay  where is it 
where s what 
don t fuck with me 
i thought i already did 
wait  no  no  wait  wait  wait 
take it easy  wait 
you have reached
bernie s rare books

after the beep 
bernie  you there

bernie

one moment 
  jesus christ

  i ll patch you through 
mr  corso  what have you got for me 
  more than i bargained for 
  what do you mean 
i mean i quit  i wanna return the book 
where are you 
i m disappointed in you  mr  corso 
you never let me down before 
well  this is different 
  you remember bernie ornstein 
  ornstein 
  yeah 
  the dealer 
i gave him your book to stash for me 
and now he s dead  murdered 
because of the book 
what else 
well  i never said it would be easy 
if it s a question of money   
it isn t the money  i want out 
this matter means a great deal to me 
mr  corso 
i m not an ungenerous man 
you know that 
proceed as arranged and you can
tack another zero onto your fee 
final call for passengers
traveling to paris   
hey  where are you  balkan 
balkan 
  do you speak english 
  yes  i do 
i would like to get your opinion on this 
what a habit for a bookbinder 
the nine gates  superb edition 
very rare  the telfer copy 
yes  you used to own it  right 
  we used to  yes 
  sold it 
we sold it when the opportunity
presented itself 
  it was too good to   
  too good to miss 
  an excellent sale 
  an excellent buy 
  impeccable condition 
  impeccable 
  are you the present owner 
  no  a client of mine 
i would never have believed
she would part with it  never 
  she 
  mrs  telfer 
i understood that it was
mr  telfer that had bought it 
he paid for it 
it was mrs  telfer who made him buy it 
  he didn t seem particularly   
  interested 
an exceptional specimen 
  do you think it could be a forgery 
  forgery 
  you hear that  pablo 
  i took you for a professional 
  you speak too lightly of forgeries 
  far too lightly 
forging a book is very expensive 
paper of the period  right inks 
too expensive to be profitable 
  still  it can be done 
  of course 
requires a great skill 
but  yes  it can be done 
do you think
that could be the case here 
what makes you ask 
my client wishes to satisfy himself
on the book s authenticity 
his name is balkan 
boris balkan of new york 
  all books have a destiny of their own 
  and a life of their own 
mr  balkan is a celebrated collector 
he s no fool 
he must know this book
is authentic 
  we know it 
  so must he 
  we had this book for years 
  many years 
and ample opportunity
to study it thoroughly 
the printing  the binding
are magnificent examples   
   of 17th century
venetian craftsmanship 
finest rag paper 
resistant to the passage of time 
none of your modern wood pulp 
watermarks  ink  typefaces 
if this is a forgery 
or a copy with missing pages restored   
   it s the work of a master 
  a master 
  yes 
have you studied the engravings 
they seem to have
some underlying significance 
but of course  here  for example 
this one could be interpreted
as a warning 
 venture too far   it seems to say   and
danger will descend on you from above  
these type of books
often contain little puzzles 
especially in the case
of such an illustrious collaborator 
collaborator 
you could not have proceeded
very far in your research  señor 
here  look close 
now  you see 
only six of the nine engravings   
   were signed by aristide torchia 
yes  and the other three 
this is one of them 
 lcf  
  who s lcf 
  think 
lucifer 
very perceptive of you  señor 
torchia was burned alive
because he wrote this book   
   in collaboration with someone else 
come on  you can t honestly believe   
the man who wrote this book
did so in alliance with the devil   
   and went to the stake for it 
even hell has its heroes  señor 
i ve seen you before 
  have you 
  yes 
are you traveling in this car 
  the next one 
  the sleeper 
i travel on the cheap 
you re a student 
something like that 
  i like trains 
  trains i m on 
just trains 
what s your name 
guess 
  green eyes   
  that ll do 
  what s yours 
  corso 
strange name 
italian  it means  run  
you don t look like a runner to me 
more the quiet type 
well  give my regards to balkan 
  tell him i m doing my best 
  balkan 
never mind 
see you around 
maybe 
i wouldn t be surprised 
yes  dean corso  mr  fargas 
corso  oh  yes  please  come in 
thank you 
please 
home  sweet home 
you won t say no to a brandy  i take it 
thank you very much 
thank you 
what handsome glasses 
they re the only ones i have left 
thanks 
  must ve been a beautiful place 
  it was 
but old families
are like ancient civilizations   
   they wither and die 
there they are  834 our of them 
a pity you didn t see them
in better times 
i used to have 5000 
but these are the survivors 
so this is the fargas collection 
not quite as i imagined it  i must say 
c est la vie  my friend 
but i keep them in perfect condition 
safe from damp  light  heat  rats 
i dust and air them every day 
these are the occult 
what do you think 
  not bad 
  not bad indeed 
at least 10 of them are extremely rare 
here 
plancy s dictionnaire infernal 
first edition  1844 
leonardo fioravanti s
compendio de secreti  1571 
and there it is 
in perfect condition 
it has traveled the
world for three and a half centuries   
   yet it might ve been printed yesterday 
is it in order  i mean  you haven t
detected anything unusual 
unusual  no 
the text is complete  the engravings too 
nine  plus the title page 
just as the catalog states   
   just like kessler in paris
and telfer in new york 
yes  it isn t the telfer anymore 
telfer killed himself 
but he sold his copy
to boris balkan first 
balkan 
if he sets his heart on a book 
no price is too high 
not that i would ever sell this one 
not at any price 
it s   
it s strange that he
should ve sent you here   
   if he already had   
you have it here 
may i see it 
superb 
beautiful 
identical 
two of the only three
to escape the flames   
   reunited for the first time
in over three centuries 
yes 
look at this slight imperfection here 
the damaged s 
the same type  the same impression 
incredible 
you see 
if it weren t for this slight discoloration   
   on the back of your copy 
no one could tell them apart 
if you don t mind  i d like to stay for a while
and examine them in detail 
what are you looking for  mr  corso 
i m not quite sure 
some books are dangerous 
not to be opened with impunity 
that s very true 
i ll be damned 
hello again 
  you didn t say you were bound for sintra 
  neither did you 
  what are you doing here 
  reading 
  i can see that 
  and bumping into people 
unexpectedly 
yes  unexpectedly is right 
are you on a business trip 
is that why you always carry
that thing around 
  is this part of your course 
  my course 
winning friends and influencing people 
  you said you were a student 
  did i 
so i am  in a way 
i like books 
do you 
  have you been traveling long 
  a while 
i don t suppose you
ever travel by motorbike 
excuse me  señor 
for me  you re sure 
the phone  sir 
  yes 
  mr  corso 
my god  how d you find me 
made any progress 
progress  yeah  you could call it that 
well 
i can t talk here  i m in the lobby 
let me call you back  where are you 
never mind that  get them
to transfer it to your room  i ll wait 
all right 
señor  pardon me  could you
send this up to my room  please 
  yes 
  thank you 
  still there 
  yes 
all right 
i ve examined the fargas copy 
it s authentic enough 
at least it looks that way 
it s like yours 
but there are discrepancies 
discrepancies 
the engravings  they re not identical 
it s  like  keys in different hands   
   doorways open in one copy
and bricked up in the other 
  and there s another thing 
  yes 
yes  go on 
ones that differ aren t signed  torchia  
they re signed  lcf  
  still there 
  lcf 
listen  where are you  anyway 
i must have that copy  mr  corso 
get it for me 
the old man wouldn t sell it
to save his life  he said as much 
did he 
hello 
just a minute 
yeah 
  what time is it 
  early  but you have to go 
  go  go where 
  the fargas place 
i ve already seen fargas 
i think you should see him again 
what is this  some kind of practical joke 
who are you 
  what do you know about fargas 
  get dressed  i ll wait for you outside 
don t bother  he isn t there 
oh  really  then where is he 
over there 
god almighty 
wanna get inside 
i had thought about it  yes 
you wait here 
shit 
well  did you find it 
you know  it s come to my attention
that you know too goddamn much 
  why do you keep following me around 
  you re wasting time asking questions 
better get out of here  there s
a flight from lisbon to paris at noon 
  we should just make it 
  what s with the  we  
there are two of us  aren t there 
what happened back there 
the old man caught someone stealing 
i guess 
  what do you guess happened to him 
  he drowned 
  with a little help from who 
  he s dead  who cares 
i do 
i could easily wind up the same way 
not with me around to look after you 
oh  i see 
you re my guardian angel then 
if you say so 
  someone s playing a game with me 
  of course  you re a part of it 
and you re getting to like it 
  hello  gruber 
  hello  mr  corso 
delighted to see you again 
we don t have any vacancies   
   but i m sure i ll be able
to organize something 
  thank you very much 
  thank you 
good afternoon 
i m dean corso  i have an appointment
with baroness kessler 
this way 
you have 30 minutes 
  yes 
  monsieur corso 
oh  yes  mr  corso  come in 
i ve heard a great deal about you 
  nothing good  i hope 
  you hope right 
well  i m reassured  baroness 
because in my trade   
   to be spoken well of
can be professionally disastrous 
  my god 
  yes  there it is 
the kessler collection 
i know your catalog almost by heart 
strange we haven t met before 
your name is a byword
among dealers and collectors 
but i imagine you know
your own reputation better than i do 
yes  well  it does keep the wolf
from the door  so to speak 
sorry  were you
in the middle of something 
my latest work  the devil  history
and myth  a kind of biography 
it will be published early next year 
  why the devil 
  i saw him one day 
i was 15 years old
and i saw him as plain as i see you now 
it was love at first sight 
you know  300 years ago 
you d have been burned at the stake   
     for saying something like that 
  i wouldn t have said it 
nor would i have made
a million by writing about it 
yeah 
what is it you wish to discuss 
mr  corso 
there s a book in your collection
i d like to examine  if possible 
the nine gates
of the kingdom of shadows 
the nine gates  an interesting work 
everyone s been asking me
about it lately 
  is that so 
  follow me 
do you truly believe
in the devil  baroness 
enough to devote my life
and my library to him 
not to mention many years of work 
don t you 
almost 
this book demands
a certain amount of faith 
i m afraid my faith
is in short supply these days 
i know this work extremely well 
i ve studied it for years 
do you have any doubts
about its authenticity 
  none whatsoever 
  you re sure 
my knowledge of this book is profound 
  i wrote a biography of its author 
  yes  i ve read it 
aristide torchia 
the devil s apprentice  excellent work 
a courageous man 
he died for the sake
of this very book in 1667 
while studying the black arts in prague 
he acquired a copy   
   of the dread delomelanicon 
this is torchia s adaptation of that work
which was written by lucifer himself 
after they burned him at the stake 
a secret society was founded   
   to perpetuate its memory
and preserve its secrets 
the order of the silver serpent 
  a sect 
  a kind of witches  coven 
for centuries 
they have met to read from this book   
   and worship the prince of darkness 
today  they have degenerated
into a social club   
   for bored millionaires and celebrities
who use its meetings   
   as an excuse to indulge
their jaded sexual appetites 
i  myself  belonged to the order 
years ago 
but time is too precious at my age 
besides  my orgy days are over 
i told them to go to the devil 
you mean it s all about sex or   
of course not 
they are under the illusion
that they owe their money and success   
   to membership in the order 
do they still meet 
every year
on the anniversary of torchia s death 
they ll be meeting very soon now 
  and you say they read from this book 
  not this one 
i took mine back when liana telfer
acquired the one in toledo 
victor fargas is a nonbeliever 
he s always refused to participate 
so naturally  they use the telfer copy 
not that it has ever worked 
  did andrew telfer ever take part 
  telfer 
no  no 
that creature  liana 
married him for his money 
she comes of an old
and aristocratic french family   
   the saint martins 
but they were penniless   
   so liana used his dollars
to restore her chateau   
   and buy the nine gates 
if he ever finds out what his wife
gets up to at these gatherings   
   he ll probably kill himself 
funny you should say that  baroness 
he hanged himself last week 
who  exactly 
are you working for  mr  corso 
my client s name is irrelevant  baroness 
i m simply trying to authenticate his copy 
the one that telfer sold him
before he died 
how stupid of me 
i should have guessed 
you ve outstayed your welcome 
mr  corso 
i was hoping to examine
your copy in detail 
certainly not 
tell your client 
who can only be boris balkan   
   to come and examine it himself 
if he dares 
tell him not to send any more
wolves in sheep s clothing 
now  kindly leave 
i m sorry if i have troubled you 
thank you very much for your time 
you don t know what you re
getting yourself into  mr  corso 
get out  before it s too late 
i m afraid it already is  baroness 
good day 
they re broken 
you should be more careful 
  i need a favor  gruber 
  certainly  mr  corso 
liana telfer 
maiden name de saint martin 
40ish  brunette  dishy 
probably accompanied by   
   a black gentleman with closely cropped
platinum blond hair and a mustache 
i wanna know if they re staying
at some hotel here 
  take a little time 
  yes  of course 
start with the five stars 
that s your best bet 
  very well  sir 
  all right 
are you feeling all right 
i ve felt better  gruber  thanks 
let me know if you locate them 
put this against the back of your neck 
you were really great down there
by the river 
i haven t thanked you for that 
all right  look 
i think it s about time you told me
what s going on here 
  someone s after your book 
  no kidding 
and you  where do you fit into it 
yeah 
there s a call for you 
may i take it in reception  please 
all right  i ll be right down 
  yes 
  anything new 
oh  his master s voice again 
no  not much aside from the fact   
   that someone s tried to take my life
a couple of times 
oh  yes  fargas has been murdered 
murdered  how do you know 
i saw him  and his copy 
or what was left of it  anyway 
someone had snatched the engravings
and tried to burn the rest 
  what do you make of it 
  that s tragic  it s tragic 
what about baroness kessler 
how did you get on today 
  where exactly are you 
  what about her copy 
no  why do i get the impression   
   that you ve been
down my neck the entire time 
you re an investment of mine  mr  corso 
i m merely looking after it 
the old woman swears
her copy s authentic   
   but i didn t get a chance
to examine it closely 
she threw me out as soon as she
guessed that you were behind my visit 
you aren t exactly in her good books 
if you know what i mean 
  you must see her again 
  what  are you kidding 
  have you seen her secretary 
  try the lunch break 
hello 
do you have a photocopy machine
back there 
oh  yes  monsieur 
  may i use it 
  of course  monsieur 
yes  hello  baroness  it s me 
the wolf in sheep s clothing 
i thought i made myself quite clear 
mr  corso 
well  i ve got something
for you  baroness 
a kind of peace offering 
will you allow me to give it to you 
please 
first  let me apologize 
i should ve told you right away
that i m working for boris balkan 
it was foolish of me to think that i could
deceive someone as astute as yourself 
  so please forgive me 
  flattery will get you nowhere  mr  corso 
get on with it 
right 
these   
   are for you 
what is this 
what is this supposed to be 
you said that your knowledge
of the nine gates was extensive   
   but did you ever compare your copy
with the other two 
no 
  why 
  well  you should 
these are copies of the engravings
in balkan s book 
you ll find that some of them differ
from yours 
differ 
so you question my book s authenticity 
do you 
if that s your peace offering 
you can take it and go 
my nine gates is absolutely genuine 
i don t dispute that  baroness 
in my opinion 
all three copies are genuine 
but the fact remains 
they display variations 
variations 
if that were true 
it would be a revelation 
what makes you so sure 
i ve already compared these
with the fargas engravings 
and in his book   
   the keys were in the other hand 
here  the doorway wasn t bricked up 
and in this one   
   the man was hanging by the other leg 
  well 
  well  what 
look closely  baroness 
the turrets 
three in yours   
   four in balkan s 
amazing 
i m convinced there ll be a third one
in here somewhere 
three variations in three copies
makes nine 
coincidence  or something more 
maybe torchia hid the secret
of the ninth gate in three books  not one 
i must admit i m impressed 
this puts an entirely different complexion
on the matter 
you have my permission
to investigate further  mr  corso 
take as long as you need 
my permission did not extend
to that  mr  corso 
nobody smokes in my library 
baroness 
excuse me  there s something missing
from my room 
has anyone been up there
while i was out 
only your wife  monsieur 
my wife  i don t have a wife 
excuse me  monsieur 
for you  sir 
  yes 
  what news 
news 
let me see 
well   
yes  the good news is that i got to
examine the old woman s book   
   and three of her engravings
were signed  lcf  
the bad news is that someone strangled
her and made a bonfire of her collection 
  now  that s tragic  wouldn t you say 
  you took the words out my mouth 
yes  it s the fargas story all over again 
i m of the mind
that they tore out the engravings   
   before they torched the place 
that makes two sets they ve got 
and my copy 
well  i learned my lesson  fortunately 
i don t carry it around with me anymore 
otherwise  it might ve gone up
in smoke 
excellent  good thinking 
well  with two copies gone   
   that seems to conclude
your assignment 
it only remains for you
to return my book 
i m staying at the ritz  you can
pick up your check at the same time 
shall we say in half an hour 
there s more bad news 
  i don t have it 
  you don t have it 
someone lifted it from my room 
listen to me very carefully  mr  corso 
i think you may already have
some idea   
   of the lengths to which i am prepared
to go when i want something 
unless you recover my property
in double quick time   
   you ll discover
just how far that can be 
  where is it 
  where s what 
the book  where is it 
would i be here if i took it 
you should know better by now 
i must apologize for my young colleague 
mr  corso   
   that was unpardonable of him 
is that her 
no  monsieur 
she was tall  dark hair 
very chic  very elegant 
which reminds me  sir 
i have the information you wanted 
the lady and gentleman
you mentioned   
   they are staying
at the plaza athénée hotel   
   suite 209  211 
thank you very much  gruber 
i owe you one 
i need a taxi  quick 
send this to mr  balkan at the ritz 
that s b a l k a n 
  fax it  immediately 
  certainly  sir 
always a pleasure to be of service 
you coming 
what do you plan to do
if you see them 
probably hide behind you 
whoa  that s them  that s them 
we should grab a taxi
before they take off 
let s go 
they re going 
coming 
couldn t you pick something
less conspicuous 
don t be so picky 
some people would give their eyeteeth
for a ride in this 
listen  we can t sit on their tail forever 
they re bound to smell a rat 
how do i look 
you look ridiculous 
sit tight 
take your pick 
no  you 
  you know everything 
  if you say so 
we lost them 
well  not at this speed 
must ve gone the other way 
you mean 
i don t know everything after all 
turn around 
30ish  brunette  dishy 
  what was her name again 
  telfer  liana telfer 
no  her maiden name 
  saint martin 
  look 
the chateau  i knew it 
keep going 
see them anywhere 
no 
  sorry to intrude on you like this 
  what are you doing here 
i just dropped by to pick up
the book you stole from my room 
  that book is mine 
  we ve been through all this before 
my husband gave it to me 
  well   
  it wasn t his to sell 
sold it to get back at you 
what happened 
  catch you with that albino 
  how dare you 
keep an eye on her 
don t 
be careful  she bites 
hi 
don t move 
either one of you 
get the book 
don t kill them up here 
you ll make a mess 
take them downstairs 
you  go first 
and you 
down 
open the door 
watch out 
i didn t know you had it in you 
you stay here and cover me 
i m going down 
who s that 
mumbo jumbo  mumbo jumbo 
mumbo jumbo 
look around you  all of you 
what do you see 
a bunch of buffoons  in fancy dress 
think the prince of darkness
would actually deign to manifest himself   
   before the likes of you 
he never has  and he never will 
never 
you read from his book   
   but you have no conception
of its true power 
i  alone  have grasped its secret 
i  alone  have fathomed
the master s grand design 
i  alone  am worthy to enjoy the fruits
of that discovery 
absolute power
to determine my own destiny 
you re insane  boris 
give it back to me 
you  liana de saint martin   
   you re even guiltier than the rest
of this pathetic rabble 
you have at least some idea of what
this book can do in the right hands 
yet  you lend yourself
to these farcical proceedings   
   these orgies of aging flesh
conducted in the master s name 
you re a charlatan 
don t  corso  don t 
let it be 
  what is it with you 
  he just murdered someone in public 
you re off the hook   
   for the other killings 
  you should be grateful 
  i m ecstatic 
you re out of a job  it s over 
what more do you want 
you know what 
not taking me for a ride 
  you were working for him all along 
  funny  i thought you were 
shit 
yes 
that s it 
precisely 
all is in readiness 
one   
   four   
   three  six  seven   
   five  eight  woo  nine 
the enigma is solved at last 
to travel in silence   
   by a long and circuitous route   
   to brave the arrows of misfortune
and fear neither noose  nor fire 
to play the greatest of all games
and win  foregoing no expense   
   is to mock the vicissitudes of fate
and gain at last the key   
   that will unlock   
   the ninth gate 
corso 
what were you expecting 
an apparition 
you re not wanted here  mr  corso 
leave 
i m the only apparition
you ll see tonight 
you ll find a check waiting
at my new york office 
payment in full 
you killed for those 
  they re worth more than money 
  infinitely more 
but they happen to be mine 
not yours 
you know something  corso 
in spite of our differences   
   i have a soft spot for you 
  i m touched 
  we have something in common 
we share the same passion 
you ve developed the same obsession 
haven t you 
unfortunately for you 
only one of us is destined to fulfill it 
you re out of your depth  kindly go 
i m not leaving here empty handed 
don t even think about it 
stand aside 
i credited you with more finesse 
  you heard me  stand back 
  put that away  it s not your style 
it seems you ve found your proper niche
at last 
i like that 
now   
   you can watch 
i m entering uncharted territory 
taking the road that leads to equality
with god 
you can t come with me 
i must travel alone 
but you may look on   
   and marvel 
  that s very kind of you 
  indeed it is 
there have been men
who have been burned alive   
   or disemboweled
for just a glimpse   
   of what you are about to witness 
i give you my allegiance  master 
i pledge myself to you  body and soul 
let me fear neither noose 
nor fire  nor poison 
erase me from the book of life   
   inscribe me
in the black book of death 
admit me to the ninth gate 
let it be so 
let it be so now 
yes 
i feel the power surge through me
like an electric current   
   rendering me capable of any feat
of mind or body 
i m invulnerable 
i m invincible 
i could float on air 
i could walk on water 
behold 
i plunge my hands in fire 
i feel no heat 
that s just great  give us another one 
it s miraculous 
i feel nothing  nothing at all 
is that it 
is the game over 
for balkan  yes 
not for you 
why didn t it work for balkan 
the ninth engraving was a forgery 
where s the real one
