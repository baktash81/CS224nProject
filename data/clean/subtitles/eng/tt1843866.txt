romanoff missed the
rendezvous point cap
hostiles are still in play
natasha batrocs on the move
circle back to rumlow and
protect the hostages
natasha
i thought you were more
than just a shield
lets see
well this is awkward
what are you doing
backing up the hard drive
its a good habit to get into
rumlow needed your help
what the hell are
you doing here
youre saving shield
intel
whatever i can get my hands on
our mission is to
rescue hostages
no thats your mission
and youve done it beautifully
you just jeopardized
this whole operation
i think thats
overstating things
okay
that ones on me
youre damn right
you just cant stop yourself
from lying can you
i didnt lie
agent romanoff had a different
mission than yours
which you didnt feel
obliged to share
im not obliged to do anything
those hostages could
have died nick
i sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didnt happen
soldiers trust each other
thats what makes it an army
not a bunch of guys running
around shooting guns
last time i trusted
someone i lost an eye
look i didnt want you doing anything
you werent comfortable with
agent romanoff is comfortable
with everything
i cant lead a mission
when the people im leading
have missions of their own
its called
compartmentalization
nobody spills the secrets
because nobody knows them all
except you
youre wrong about me
i do share
im nice like that
insight bay
captain rogers does not have
clearance for project insight
director override
fury nicholas j
confirmed
you know they used
to play music
yeah
my grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years
granddad worked in
a nice building
got good tips
hed walk home every night a roll
of ones stuffed in his lunch bag
hed say hi
people would say hi back
time went on the
neighborhood got rougher
hed say hi
theyd say keep on steppin
granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter
did he ever get mugged
every week some punk would
say whats in the bag
what would he do
hed show them
bunch of crumpled ones
and a loaded 22 magnum
yeah granddad loved people
but he didnt trust
them very much
yeah i know
theyre a little bit
bigger than a 22
this is project insight
three nextgeneration
helicarriers
synced to a network of
targeting satellites
launched from the lemurian star
once we get them in the air
they never need to come down
continuous suborbital flight
courtesy of our new repulsor engines
stark
he had a few suggestions
once he got an upclose
look at our old turbines
these new longrange
precision guns
can eliminate 1000
hostiles a minute
the satellites can read a terrorists dna
before he steps outside his spider hole
were gonna neutralize a lot of
threats before they even happen
thought the punishment usually
came after the crime
we cant afford to
wait that long
whos we
after new york i convinced
the world security council
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis
for once were way
ahead of the curve
by holding a gun to everyone on
earth and calling it protection
you know i read
those ssr files
greatest generation
you guys did some nasty stuff
yeah we compromised
sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well
but we did it so that
people could be free
this isnt freedom
this is fear
shield takes the world as
it is not as wed like it to be
and its getting damn near past time
for you to get with that program cap
dont hold your breath
welcome to the smithsonian
visitor information booths are
available on the second level
a symbol to the nation
a hero to the world
the story of captain america is one
of honor bravery and sacrifice
denied enlistment
due to poor health
steven rogers was
chosen for a program
unique in the annals
of american warfare
one that would transform him into
the worlds first supersoldier
in this rare footage
everyones favorite war
hero captain america
battle tested
captain america
and his howling commandos
quickly earned their stripes
their mission
taking down hydra the nazi
rogue science division
best friends since childhood
bucky barnes and steven
rogers were inseparable
on both schoolyard
and battlefield
barnes is the only howling
commando to give his life
in service of his country
that was a difficult winter
a blizzard had trapped half our
battalion behind the german line
steve captain rogers
he fought his way through
a hydra blockade
that had pinned our
allies down for months
he saved over 1000 men
including the man who would
who would become my
husband as it turned out
even after he died steve
was still changing my life
you should be proud
of yourself peggy
i have lived a life
my only regret is that you
didnt get to live yours
what is it
for as long as i can remember i
just wanted to do what was right
i guess im not quite sure
what that is anymore
and i thought i could throw
myself back in and follow orders
serve
its just not the same
youre always so dramatic
look you saved the world
we rather mucked it up
you didnt
knowing that you helped found shield
is half the reason i stay
hey
the world has changed and
none of us can go back
all we can do is our best
and sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over
peggy
steve
yeah
youre alive
you came back
yeah peggy
its been so long
so long
well i couldnt
leave my best girl
not when she owes me a dance

fury nicholas j
world security council
confirmed
if nick fury thinks he can
get his costumed thugs
and strike commandos to mop
up his mess hes sadly mistaken
this failure is unacceptable
considering this
attack took place
one mile from my countrys
sovereign waters
its a bit more than that i
move for immediate hearing
we dont need hearings
we need action
its this councils duty
to oversee shield
a breach like this raises
serious questions
like how the hell
did a french pirate
manage to hijack a covert shield
vessel in broad daylight
for the record councilman
hes algerian
i can draw a map if itd help
i appreciate your wit
secretary pierce
but this council takes things like
international piracy fairly seriously
really i dont
i dont care about one boat
i care about the fleet
if this council is going
to fall to rancor
every time someone pushes
us on the playing field
maybe we need someone
to oversee us
mr secretary nobody
is suggesting
excuse me
more trouble mr secretary
depends on your definition
i work 40 floors away and it takes
a hijacking for you to visit
a nuclear war would do it too
you busy in there
nothing some earmarks cant fix
im here to ask a favor
i want you to call for a vote
project insight has
to be delayed
nick thats not a favor
thats a subcommittee hearing
along one
it could be nothing it
probably is nothing
i just need time to
make sure its nothing
but if its something
then well both be damn glad those
helicarriers arent in the air
fine
but you got to get iron man to
stop by my nieces birthday party
thank you sir
and not just a flyby
hes got to mingle
the thing is
i think its getting worse
a cop pulled me over last week
he thought i was drunk
i swerved to miss a plastic bag
i thought it was an ied
some stuff you leave there
other stuff you bring back
its our job to figure
out how to carry it
is it gonna be in a big suitcase
or in a little manpurse
its up to you
ill see you next week
definitely
look who it is the running man
caught the last few minutes
its pretty intense
yeah brother we all
got the same problems
guilt
regret
you lose someone
my wingman riley
flying a night mission
standard pj rescue op
nothing we hadnt done
1000 times before

there just to watch
im sorry
after that
i had a really hard time finding a
reason for being over there you know
but youre happy now
back in the world
the number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero
so hell yeah

about getting out
no
i dont know

why was fury in your apartment
i dont know
cap they want you
back at shield
yeah give me a second
they want you now
okay
youre a terrible liar
strike team
escort captain rogers
back to shield
immediately for questioning
i told him
lets go
yeah
strike move it out
captain rogers
neighbor
captain
im alexander pierce
sir its an honor
the honors mine captain
my father served in the 101st
come on in
that photo was taken five
years after nick and i met
when i was at state
department in bogota
eln rebels took the embassy
and security got me out but
the rebels took hostages
nick was deputy chief of the shield
station there
and he comes to me with a plan
he wants to storm the
building through the sewers
i said no well negotiate
turned out the eln didnt negotiate
so they put out a kill order
they stormed the basement
and what do they find
they find it empty
nick had ignored
my direct order
and carried out an unauthorized
military operation on foreign soil
and saved the lives of a
dozen political officers
including my daughter
so you gave him a promotion
ive never had any
cause to regret it
captain why was nick in
your apartment last night
i dont know
did you know it was bugged
i did because nick told me
did he tell you he was
the one who bugged it
i want you to see something
who hired you batroc
is that live
yeah they picked him up last night
in a notsosafe house in algiers
are you saying hes a suspect
assassination isnt batrocs line
no no its more
complicated than that
batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the lemurian star
and he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer
and then the money was run
through 17 fictitious accounts
the last one going
to a holding company
that was registered
to a jacob veech
am i supposed to
know who that is
not likely veech
died six years ago
his last address was
1435 elmhurst drive
when i first met nick his
mother lived at 1437
are you saying fury
hired the pirates why
the prevailing theory
was that the hijacking was a
cover for the acquisition
and sale of classified
intelligence
the sale went sour and
that led to nicks death
if you really knew nick fury
youd know thats not true
why do you think were talking
see i took a seat on the council
not because i wanted to
but because nick asked me to
because we were both realists
we knew that despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric
to build a really better world
sometimes means having to
tear the old one down
and that makes enemies
those people that call you
dirty because you got the guts
to stick your hands in the mud and
try to build something better
and the idea that those
people could be happy today
makes me really really angry
captain you were the last
one to see nick alive
i dont think
thats an accident
and i dont think
you do either
so im gonna ask again
why was he there
he told me not to trust anyone
i wonder if that included him
im sorry
those were his last words
excuse me
captain
somebody murdered my friend
and im gonna find out why
anyone gets in my way
theyre gonna regret it
anyone
understood
operations control
confirmed
keep all strike
personnel on site
understood
yes sir
forensics
confirmed
cap
rumlow
evidence response found some fibers
on the roof they want us to see
you want me to get
the tac team ready
no lets wait and see
what it is first
right
whats the status so far
administrations level
confirmed
excuse me
im sorry about what
happened with fury
its messed up what
happened to him
thank you
records
confirmed
before we get started
does anyone want to get out
mobilize strike
units 25th floor
whoa big guy
i just want you to know
cap this isnt personal
it kind of feels personal
drop the shield and put
your hands in the air
give it up rogers
get that door open
you have nowhere to go
are you kidding me
hes headed for the garage
lock down the bridge
stand down captain rogers
stand down
repeat stand down
eyes here
whatever your op is bury it
this is level one
contact dot
all traffic lights in
the district go red
shut all runways at bwi
iad and reagan
all security cameras in the city go
through this monitor right here
scan all open sources
phones computers
pdas whatever
if someone tweets
about this guy
i want to know about it
with all due respect if shield
is conducting
a manhunt for captain america
we deserve to know why
because he lied to us
captain rogers has information
regarding the death of director fury
he refused to share it
as difficult as
this is to accept
captain america is a
fugitive from shield
where is it
safe
do better
where did you get it
why would i tell you
fury gave it to you why
whats on it
i dont know
stop lying
i only act like i know
everything rogers
i bet you knew fury hired
the pirates didnt you
well it makes sense the ship was
dirty fury needed a way in so do you
im not gonna ask you again
i know who killed fury
most of the intelligence community
doesnt believe he exists
the ones that do call
him the winter soldier
hes credited with over
two dozen assassinations
in the last 50 years
so hes a ghost story
five years ago i was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of iran
somebody shot out my
tires near odessa
we lost control went
straight over a cliff
i pulled us out
but the winter
soldier was there
i was covering my
engineer so he shot him
straight through me
soviet slug
no rifling byebye bikinis
yeah i bet you look
terrible in them now
going after him is a dead end
i know ive tried
like you said hes
a ghost story
well lets find out
what the ghost wants
nick fury was murdered
in cold blood
to any reasonable person
that would make him a
martyr not a traitor
you know what makes
him a traitor
hiring a mercenary to
hijack his own ship
nick fury used your friendship
to coerce this council into
delaying project insight
a project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations
at best he lied to you
at worst
are you calling for
my resignation
ive got a pen and
paper right here
that discussion can be
tabled for a later time
but you do want to
have a discussion
weve already had it mr
secretary
this council moves to immediately
reactivate project insight
if you want to say something
snappy now would be a good time
first rule of going on the
run is dont run walk
if i run in these shoes
theyre gonna fall off
the drive has a level six homing
program so as soon as we boot up
shield will know
exactly where we are
how much time will we have
about nine minutes from
now
fury was right about that ship
somebodys trying
to hide something
this drive is protected
by some sort of ai
it keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands
can you override it
the person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me
slightly
im gonna try running a tracer
this is a program that shield
developed
to track hostile malware
so if we cant read the file
maybe we can find out
where it came from
can i help you guys
with anything
no my fiancé was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations
right were getting married
congratulations where are you
guys thinking about going
new jersey
i have the exact same glasses
wow you two are
practically twins
yeah i wish
specimen
if you guys need anything
ive been aaron
thank you
you said nine minutes come on
relax
got it
you know it
i used to lets go
standard tac team
two behind two across
and two coming straight at us
if they make us ill engage you hit
the south escalator to the metro
shut up and put your arm around me
laugh at something i said
what
do it
negative at the source
give me a floor rundown
negative on three
negative on two
snake the upper levels
work down to me
kiss me
what
public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable
yes they do
you still uncomfortable
its not exactly the
word i would use
where did captain america
learn how to steal a car
nazi germany
and were borrowing take
your feet off the dash
all right i have a question for you
which you do not have to answer
i feel like if you
dont answer it though
youre kind of answering it you know
what
was that your first
kiss since 1945
that bad huh
i didnt say that
well it kind of sounds like
thats what youre saying
no i didnt
i just wondered how much
practice youve had
you dont need practice
everybody needs practice
it was not my first
kiss since 1945
im 95 im not dead
nobody special though
believe it or not
its kind of hard
to find someone with
shared life experience
well thats all right you
just make something up
what like you
i dont know
the truth is a matter
of circumstance
its not all things to all
people all the time
neither am i
thats a tough way to live
its a good way not
to die though
you know its kind of
hard to trust someone
when you dont know who
that someone really is
yeah
who do you want me to be
how about a friend
well theres a chance you might
be in the wrong business rogers
this is it
the file came from
these coordinates
so did i
this camp is where
i was trained
change much
a little
pick up the pace ladies
lets go lets go
double time
come on rogers move it
come on fall in
rogers
i said fall in
this is a dead end
zero heat signatures zero
waves not even radio
whoever wrote the file must have
used a router to throw people off
what is it
army regulations forbid
storing munitions
within 500 yards
of the barracks
this building is in
the wrong place
this is shield
maybe where it started
and theres starks father
howard
whos the girl
if youre already working
in a secret office
why do you need to
hide the elevator
this cant be the data point
this technology is ancient
yes spells yes
shall we play a game
its from a movie that was really
i know i saw it
rogers steven
born 1918
romanoff natalia alianovna
born 1984
its some kind of recording
i am not a recording fraulein
i may not be the man i was
when the captain took
me prisoner in 1945
but i am
you know this thing
arnim zola was a german scientist
who worked for the red skull
hes been dead for years
first correction i am swiss
second look around you
i have never been more alive
in 1972 i received a
terminal diagnosis
science could not save my body
my mind however that
was worth saving
on 200000 feet of databanks
you are standing in my brain
how did you get here
invited
it was operation paperclip
after world war ii
shield recruited german
scientists with strategic value
they thought i could
help their cause
i also helped my own
hydra died with the red skull
cut off one head two more
shall take its place
prove it
accessing archive
hydra was founded on the
belief that humanity
could not be trusted
with its own freedom
what we did not realize
was that if you try
to take that freedom
they resist
the war taught us much
humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly
after the war shield
was founded
and i was recruited
the new hydra grew
a beautiful parasite
inside shield
for 70 years
hydra has been secretly
feeding crisis reaping war
and when history
did not cooperate
history was changed
thats impossible shield
would have stopped you
accidents will happen
hydra created a world so chaotic
that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom
to gain its security
once a purification
process is complete
hydras new world
order will arise
we won captain
your death amounts to
the same as your life
a zero sum
as i was saying
whats on this drive
project insight
requires insight
so i wrote an algorithm
what kind of algorithm
what does it do
the answer to your
question is fascinating
unfortunately you shall
be too dead to hear it
steve we got a bogey
short range ballistic
30 seconds tops
who fired it
shield
i am afraid i have been
stalling captain
admit it
its better this way
we are both of us
out of time
call in the asset
im going to go mr pierce
you need anything
before i leave
no its fine renata
you can go home
okay nightnight
good night
want some milk
the timetable has moved
our window is limited
two targets level six
they already cost me zola
i want confirmed
death in 10 hours
sorry mr pierce i
i forgot my
phone
renata i wish you
would have knocked
hey man
im sorry about this we
need a place to lay low
everyone we know is
trying to kill us
not everyone
you okay
yeah
whats going on
when i first joined shield
i thought i was going straight
but i guess i just traded
in the kgb for hydra
i thought i knew whose
lies i was telling
but i guess i cant tell
the difference anymore
theres a chance you might
be in the wrong business
i owe you
its okay
if it was the other way around
and it was down to me
to save your life
now you be honest with me
would you trust me to do it
i would now
and im always honest
well you seem pretty chipper
for someone who just found
out they died for nothing
well guess i just like
to know who im fighting
i made breakfast
if you guys eat
that sort of thing
so the question is
who at shield could launch
a domestic missile strike
pierce
who happens to be sitting on top of the
most secure building in the world
but hes not working alone
zolas algorithm was
on the lemurian star
so was jasper sitwell
so the real question is how
do the two most wanted people
in washington kidnap a shield
officer in broad daylight
the answer is you dont
whats this
call it a résumé
is this bakhmala
the khalid khandil
mission that was you
you didnt say he
was a pararescue
is this riley
yeah
i heard they couldnt bring in the
choppers because of the rpgs
what did you use
a stealth chute
no
these
i thought you said
you were a pilot
i never said pilot
i cant ask you to do this sam
you got out for a good reason
dude captain america
needs my help
theres no better
reason to get back in
where can we get our hands
on one of these things
the last one is at fort meade
behind three guarded gates
and a 12inch steel wall
shouldnt be a problem
listen i got to
fly home tonight
because i got some
constituency problem
and i got to press the flesh
any constituent in particular mr
senator
no not really
twentythree kind of hot
real hot you know
wants to be a reporter i think
i dont know
who listens at that point
doesnt sound like much
of a problem to me
really because shes
killing my back
but this isnt the place
to talk about it
this is a nice pin
thank you
come here
hail hydra
see its right there
yeah i just saw that
should i get it checked
i think you should
i need a minute
bring the car around
yes sir
agent sitwell how was lunch
i hear the crab cakes
here are delicious
who is this
the goodlooking guy in the
sunglasses your 10 oclock
your other 10 oclock
there you go
what do you want
youre gonna go around the
corner to your right
theres a gray car
two spaces down
you and i are gonna take a ride
and why would i do that
because that tie looks
really expensive
and id hate to mess it up
tell me about zolas algorithm
never heard of it
what were you doing
on the lemurian star
i was throwing up
i get seasick
is this little display meant to insinuate
that youre gonna throw me off the roof
because its really not
your style rogers
youre right
its not
its hers
wait what about that girl
from accounting laura
lillian lip piercing right
yeah shes cute
yeah im not ready for that
zolas algorithm is a program
for choosing
insights targets
what targets
you
a tv anchor in cairo the
under secretary of defense
a high school valedictorian
in iowa city
bruce banner stephen strange
anyone whos a threat
to hydra
now or in the future
in the future how
could it know
how could it not
the 21st century
is a digital book
zola taught hydra
how to read it
your bank records
medical histories
voting patterns
emails phone calls
your damn sat scores
zolas algorithm
evaluates peoples past
to predict their future
and what then
oh my god pierce
is gonna kill me
what then
then the insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list
a few million at a time
hydra doesnt like leaks
then why dont you try
sticking a cork in it
insights launching in 16 hours
were cutting it a
little bit close here
i know well use him
to bypass the dna scans
and access the
helicarriers directly
what are you crazy
that is a terrible
terrible idea
shit
hang on
i have her find him
go i got this
taking fire above and
below expressway
civilians threatened repeat
civilians threatened
i make an lz 2300 block
of virginia avenue
rendezvous two minutes
get out of the way
stay out of the way
bucky
who the hell is bucky
drop the shield cap
get on your knees
get on your knees
get down get down
get on your knees
down
dont move
put the gun down
not here not here
it was him
he looked right at me like
he didnt even know me
how is that even possible
it was like 70 years ago
zola
buckys whole unit
was captured in 43
zola experimented on him
whatever he did helped
bucky survive the fall
they must have found him and
none of thats
your fault steve
even when i had
nothing i had bucky
we need to get a doctor here
if we dont put
pressure on that wound
shes gonna bleed out
here in the truck
that thing was
squeezing my brain
who is this guy
three holes start digging
gsw shes lost at least a pint
maybe two
let me take her
shell want to see him first
about damn time
lacerated spinal column
cracked sternum
shattered collarbone
perforated liver
and one hell of a headache
dont forget your
collapsed lung
lets not forget that
otherwise im good
they cut you open
your heart stopped
tetrodotoxin b
slows the pulse to
one beat a minute
banner developed it for stress
didnt work so great for him
but we found a use for it
why all the secrecy
why not just tell us
any attempt on the directors
life had to look successful
cant kill you if
youre already dead
besides
i wasnt sure who to trust
sergeant barnes
bucky no
the procedure has
already started
you are to be the
new fist of hydra
put him on ice
sir
hes unstable
erratic
mission report
mission report now
the man on the bridge
who was he
you met him earlier this
week on another assignment
i knew him
your work has been
a gift to mankind
you shaped the century
and i need you to do
it one more time
societys at a tipping point
between order and chaos
and tomorrow morning were
gonna give it a push
but if you dont do your
part i cant do mine
and hydra cant give the world
the freedom it deserves
but i knew him
prep him
hes been out of cryo
freeze too long
then wipe him and start over
this man declined the
nobel peace prize
he said peace wasnt
an achievement
it was a responsibility
see its stuff like this
that gives me trust issues
we have to stop the launch
i dont think the councils
accepting my calls anymore
whats that
once the helicarriers
reach 3000 feet
theyll triangulate with insight
satellites becoming fully weaponized
we need to breach those carriers
and replace their targeting
blades with our own
one or two wont cut it
we need to link all three
carriers for this to work
because if even one of those
ships remains operational
a whole lot of people
are gonna die
we have to assume everyone
aboard those carriers is hydra
we have to get past them
insert these server blades
and maybe just maybe we
can salvage whats left
were not salvaging anything
were not just taking
down the carriers nick
were taking down shield
shield had nothing
to do with this
you gave me this mission
this is how it ends
shields been compromised
you said so yourself
hydra grew right under your
nose and nobody noticed
why do you think were meeting
in this cave i noticed
how many paid the
price before you did
look i didnt
know about barnes
even if you had would
you have told me
or would you have
compartmentalized that too
shield hydra
it all goes
hes right
dont look at me
i do what he does just slower
well
it looks like youre giving
the orders now captain
we looked for you after
my folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery
i know im sorry i just
kind of wanted to be alone
how was it
it was okay
shes next to dad
i was gonna ask
i know what youre gonna say buck
i just
we can put the couch
cushions on the floor
like when we were kids
itll be fun all you got
to do is shine my shoes
maybe take out the trash
come on
thank you buck but i
can get by on my own
the thing is you dont have to
im with you to the
end of the line pal
hes gonna be there you know
i know
look whoever he used to
be and the guy he is now
i dont think hes
the kind you save
hes the kind you stop
i dont know if i can do that
well he might not
give you a choice
he doesnt know you
he will
gear up its time
you gonna wear that
no if youre gonna fight a
war you got to wear a uniform
oh man
i am so fired
we are in final launch sequence
we are go on guidance
all personnel to
launch stations
and how was your flight
lovely
the ride from the
airport less so
sadly shield cant
control everything
including captain america
this facility is
biometrically controlled
and these will give you
unrestricted access
ive been parking
there for two months
but its his spot
so wheres he been
i think afghanistan
negative dt six the
pattern is full
well he couldve
said something
must be the dish
ill check it out
triskelion command request we
clear the area for launch
excuse us
i know the road hasnt
exactly been smooth
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way
finally were here
and the world
should be grateful
attention all shield
agents
this is steve rogers
youve heard a lot about
me over the last few days
some of you were even
ordered to hunt me down
but i think its time
you know the truth
shield is not
what we thought it was
its been taken over by hydra
alexander pierce
is their leader
the strike and insight
crew are hydra as well
i dont know how many more
but i know theyre
in the building
they could be standing
right next to you
they almost have what they want
absolute control
they shot nick fury
and it wont end there
if you launch those
helicarriers today
hydra will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way
unless we stop them
i know im asking a lot
but the price of freedom is high
it always has been
and its a price im
willing to pay
and if im the only
one then so be it
but im willing to bet im not
did you write that down first or
was it off the top of your head
you smug son of a bitch
arrest him
i guess ive got the floor
preempt the launch sequence
send those ships up now
is there a problem
is there a problem
im sorry sir
im not gonna
launch those ships
captains orders
move away from your station
like he said
hold it right there
put the gun down
captains orders
you picked the
wrong side agent
depends on where
youre standing
close the bay door
close the bay door now
close the bay door
theyre initiating launch
hey cap how do we know the
good guys from the bad guys
if theyre shooting
at you theyre bad
hey cap
i found those bad guys
you were talking about
you okay
im not dead yet
let me ask you a question
what if pakistan marched
into mumbai tomorrow
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters
into a soccer stadium
for execution
and you could just stop it
with a flick of the switch
wouldnt you
wouldnt you all
not if it was your switch
im sorry
did i step on your moment
satellites in range
at 3000 feet
falcon status
engaging
all right cap im in
oh shit
eight minutes cap
working on it
what are you doing
shes disabling
security protocols
and dumping all the secrets
onto the internet
including hydras
and shields
if you do this
none of your past is
gonna remain hidden
are you sure youre ready
for the world to see you
as you really are
are you
alpha lock
falcon where are you now
i had to take a detour
oh yeah

bravo lock
two down one to go
all shield
pilots scramble

captain rogers has got
disabling the encryption
is an executive order
it takes two alpha
level members
dont worry companys coming
did you get my flowers
im glad youre here nick
really
because i thought
you had me killed
you know how the game works
so why make me head
of shield
because you were the best
and the most ruthless
person i ever met
i did what i did
to protect people
our enemies are
your enemies nick
disorder war
its just a matter of time before
a dirty bomb goes off in moscow
or an emp fries chicago
diplomacy
a holding action nick
a bandaid
and you know where i learned that
bogota
you didnt ask you just
did what had to be done
i can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people
by sacrificing 20 million
its the next step nick
if you have the
courage to take it
no i have the courage not to
retinal scanner active
you dont think weve wiped
your clearance from the system
i know you erased my password
probably deleted
my retinal scan
but if you want to stay ahead of me mr
secretary
you need to keep both eyes open
alpha level confirmed
encryption code accepted
safeguards removed
charlie carrier is 45

romanoff
natasha
natasha come on
those really do sting
hail hydra
youre out of your depth kid
son of a bitch
please tell me you got
that chopper in the air
sam where are you
41st floor northwest corner
were on it stay where you are
not an option
41st floor 41st
its not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building
hill wheres steve you
got a location on rogers
you know me
no i dont
bucky
youve known me your whole life
your name is james
buchanan barnes
shut up
im not gonna fight you
youre my friend
youre my mission
youre my mission
then finish it
because im with you to
the end of the line
on your left
do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
i do
why havent we yet heard
from captain rogers
i dont know what there
is left for him to say
i think the wreck in the
middle of the potomac
made his point
fairly eloquently
well he could explain how
this country is expected to
maintain its national security
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus
hydra was selling you
lies not intelligence
many of which you seemed to have
had a personal hand in telling
agent you should know
that there are some
on this committee
who feel given your
service record
both for this country
and against it
that you belong in
a penitentiary
not mouthing off
on capitol hill
youre not going to
put me in a prison
youre not going to put any of
us in a prison you know why
do enlighten us
because you need us
yes the world is a
vulnerable place
and yes we help
make it that way
but were also the ones best
qualified to defend it
so if you want to
arrest me arrest me
youll know where to find me
so youve experienced
this sort of thing before
you get used to it
weve been data
mining hydras files
looks like a lot of rats
didnt go down with the ship
im headed to europe tonight
wanted to ask if youd come
theres something i
got to do first
how about you wilson could
use a man with your abilities
im more of a
soldier than a spy
all right then
anybody asks for me tell them
they can find me right here
you should be honored thats
about as close as he gets
to saying thank you
not going with him
no
not staying here
nah
i blew all my covers i got
to go figure out a new one
that might take a while
im counting on it
that thing you asked for
i called in a few
favors from kiev
will you do me a favor
call that nurse
shes not a nurse
and youre not a shield
agent
what was her name again
sharon
shes nice
be careful steve
you might not want to
pull on that thread
youre going after him
you dont have to come with me
i know
when do we start
its over fury has released
everything to the public
everything he knows about
herr strucker if they get
word of our work here
if they find out
we serve hydra
hydra shield
two sides of a coin thats
no longer currency
what we have
is worth more than any
of them ever knew
weve only scratched the
surface and already
there are other facilities doing
hydras good work around the world
well feed them to captain america
and his colorful friends
and keep them off our scent
what about the volunteers
the dead will be buried so deep
their own ghosts wont
be able to find them
and the survivors
the twins
sooner or later they
will meet the twins
its not a world
of spies anymore
not even a world of heroes
