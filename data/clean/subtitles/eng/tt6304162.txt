good afternoon
good afternoon
215 roubles
hey in case the family status
of an employee of the company changes
will they realize it up there
sooner or later
during some teambuilding or company party
because everybody has to be
with a family with children
and why do you ask
just curious
during all this time ive been working here
ive never seen anybody divorce
thats because its our corporate policy
you know yourself
people divorce only due to
some natural reasons
death and so on
so you mean nobody ever got divorced
last new years corporate party
one of the it guys
brought a fake wife
with two daughters
no way
because he got divorced with his real wife
this is how he was overcoming the situation
wow
where he found a fake wife
i dont know
maybe hired
looks like nobody found out about it yet
he still works here
maybe he married one more time
i see
so if you divorce and then quickly remarry
you can get unnoticed
if your families arent too close friends
my family isnt
then who cares
well yeah
look and where from do you know about this it guy
well first of all
hes not an it guy
i said it on purpose
hes from a different department
dont ask from which
second of all
i know it from the source
well you got it
by the way
i havent talked to him for a long time
lack of time
just
saying hello to each other sometimes from afar
you wont tell anybody right
just like during a confession dont worry
what do you think
will there be the end of the world
for sure
will you hand me some material to work with
have anything
god said we must share
maybe ill get something in the evening
this will a mutual benefit dont worry
mhm
oh my
hes worrying a lot
good let him worry
hes suffering poor guy
good they all are masters at messing things up
how about cleaning things
you think hes worrying about the kid
yeah right
ha has loans from the bank hes afraid of getting fired
you know his boss is all so orthodox to the bone
a fundamentalist
mhm
has a huge beard while wearing a brionicostume
a glamorous guy
indeed
he started an orthodox shariah there
you get a job only if youre married
and baptized of course
and during our vacations we had a pilgrimage
all around the temples
yeah i remember on the other hand
its kind of cool exoticism
oh come on its so boring
bend your leg shall we
but he has a big salary for that
so as i see hes really getting nervous
you think he can really get fired
the hell i know
i really hope
and what about the alimony
ouch
are you kidding me
hey theres very little left relax
my friend told me once
that her boss is fond of extreme sports
really
yes
so hes taking them to parachute or to canoe
or to downhillski
downhillskiing is cool
well
the knee of my friend broke
so she had to wear a cast for half a year
goodbye the ligament
hardcore
so some of them started buying
certificates on the internet
about the heart condition
or the bloodpressure
and
got fired
if youre ill go to a hospital
holy crap
so the temples of yours
those prayers  all that is still bearable
turn over
well i dont know i think
vacations mean summer sunshine a beach
an allinclusive hotel
and what does your new boyfriend say about this
hes fine with it
hes so you know uptodate
well he has the money
hes healthy why not be uptodate
knock on the wood
dont worry im not a hoodoo
im not superstitious too it was just a reflex
so is he divorced any kids
yeah divorces 3 years ago
the daughter is grownup shes studying abroad
in portugal i think
and works there too
and how old is he
hes looking good
he does some chinese exercises
doesnt smoke almost doesnt drink
im even jealous
so i even it up
just a bit
and how does he feel about your boy
nothing particular
looks like this boy of mine hates me
hes just like his father
even starts to smell like him
secondary sexual characteristics
hes growing up
and did you want him to stay an angel
all the time
he may look like an angel
oh hi will you wait
but hes actually all so spiky
he almost tore me during childbirth
didnt want to get out
i was delivering almost 24hours
yeah the life is hard
just like my tyke
everytime i look at her i realize a sad fact
that shes just like her father
i hope he died there in his kapotnya
look
yeah
but you know she doesnt drink
i told her that ill kill her immediately
shes a girl of a character
but not like her father more like his mother
shes such a bitch
i forgot how old is your daughter
19 but shes real stupid
well no shes smart
she finished the school exams
but doesnt want to study anymore
no matter what you do
all she wants is to roam around
i tell her if you get pregnant your life is ruined
dont count on me
and she says i have safe sex
well at least that
i dont know how shell live further
no profession no desire whatsoever
i tell her who do you want to be
a member of parliament
i say study while you still have time
she says you dont need to study to be an mp
what can i say
so your daughter is clever
its because shes just like me
yes

zhenya
what
whats the matter
somethings wrong
voices in the background suggesting to have a drink
girls lets drink for love
for love
you my beauties
lets make a selfie
for love and selfie
hey
youre asleep
its not fair
i love you
do you hear
i never loved anyone
only my mother when i was a child
and she was so blunt with me
never caressed
never said a kind word
only the discipline the order the studying
wicked and lonely wretch
she is alive and well i hope
alive
and actually quite healthy
we dont talk much
every time i call we end up in a scandal
even later on i cannot understand why
who started it
only with you i realized what love is
i didnt love my husband
and before him i had no one
and even with him i got pregnant by mistake
he was so happy suggested to get married
everything is fine were together
but i didnt want that
i was so scared
i was afraid to do the abortion
i was afraid to keep it
didnt want it so much
when i was delivering i thought i was gonna die
they had me in critical care
and then when they brought him
i couldnt even look at him
like some kind of disgust
i even didnt have milk
later it somehow got better
some life started
some
unlove
you cant live in unlove
even now when i look at him or think about him
like right now
it seems like i have made
some unforgivable mistake
i blame him and i blame myself
how much do i want to be happy
im a bitch aint i
of course
youre the loveliest bitch in the world
you really love me
come to me
yeah hello
did you see alyosha yesterday evening
no i didnt come home last night why
the school called right now
they said he wasnt there
neither today not yesterday
what do you mean
and who called
the head teacher
the head teacher
and what did she say
that he wasnt there
neither today not yesterday are you deaf or what
had he been in at home
i dont know
i came yesterday at night
i thought hes sleeping
woke up late today
i thought hes already left as usually
his phone is off has he called you
no
dear god
stop panicking hell come back
what else will he do
we need to call that
the friend of his
i already have he hadnt seen him either
neither today not yesterday
i see
and where are you now
at home where else
and you fuckin cannot understand if he
had been home or not
i damn cannot
why
its easy
then come and see yourself
im at work in case you didnt know
we havent heard of him
for more than 24hours
do you get this or not
maybe hes in the elevator
right now for example
i think youre exaggerating
he must have done something
and is afraid now that
youll give him a beating
thats why hes roaming around somewhere
so im at fault now right
you even
you dont even know if he had been at home or not
he probably had
hello
hello
listen
im calling the police right now
and you can keep sitting at your work
and speculate what may had been
and what may not
got it
blockhead
dasha look
one office worker
says to another office worker
what car do you have
volkswagen passat
and i have volkswagen credit
so funny
look
one office worker
wait wait wait seryozha
it was funny
ive finished
good thank you
take that
wait for me in the car
we have one more call
okay
what can i say
i see no crime here
what crime
you know sometimes
the parents finish off their child
and then claim that the child got lost
you thought that way about me
thats the version we check the first
here we have a runner the usual case
12 years old a rebelheart
full of hormones
hell roam around for a couple of days
and will come back
well we can of course go to the department
spend a couple of hours filling a detailed form
and probably already not today
at least because your husband
must be present as well
and even then
i think this case wont go further
than the material checking
you say theres no crime
and what if he was kidnapped
cause i cant even imagine
where he can be now
he must be roaming somewhere around the block
he wont last long
hes used to the comfort and its right here
they come back to such families
that you couldnt even imagine
cause the street is not a home
no matter how shitty the latter is
and considering the kidnapping
this is how it goes
first theres the material checking it means
examining the parents relatives
friends possible witnesses and so on
we dont have enough staff for it
plus there are a lot of other cases
robberies murders burglaries thuggery
thus collecting materials can last
a couple of days
if by then the runner doesnt come back
the searching operations begin
and if during them we find reasons
ie factual evidence of murder or kidnapping
then criminal proceedings are initiated
but it is initiated by
the investigating committee
you know yourself how long can it take
the writing itself takes forever
during this time they usually
come back and run away again
so you wont do anything right
maam im explaining the real situation
we must react and we will
but in this particular case
we physically dont have time or staff
to keep chasing every teenager
i got it
the case will be thrown to a trashbin right
and what do i do
just sit and wait till he returns
and what if he doesnt return
facts are stubborn things
in most cases
the teenage runners come back
in a weeks time
in 10 days at most
what i can advise is
if you really want to start looking for him
go to the internet
to the webpage of the searchandrescue squad
call them give them all the information
theyll tell which information they need
they are volunteers not a government service
they work 24hours for free
without any bureaucracy
a welldeveloped highlyefficient
algorithm of actions
where do i know from
have been collaborating productively
look heres my card
your phone number
has already been written down
well stay in touch
is that it
for now yes
unreal
listen
if it were any other officer
it would have been
much harsher and less informative
and its not because im so kind
its because i save my time yours
and volunteers
who will start searching
the sooner you contact them
and they will find your fool
somewhere in the streets or in a mall
and most probably at some place of his friends
whose parents went away for a day or two
so that hes alone now
so take actions
or keep waiting its up to you
when have you spoken to him last time
i just saw him leaving for school
good afternoon
good afternoon
im sorry there are traffic jams
take a seat engage yourself
my names ivan
im the coordinator
of the searchandrescue squad
yes my wife told me on the phone
great then lets start i mean continue
so i say it one more time
so that there are fewer questions
now im going to carefully ask you
about your son alyosha
while other searchers are surveying
the neighbours possible witnesses
on the streets in the shops
everywhere where he could have been seen
yes lena
the neighbours got nothing
nothing at all
nobody has seen him neither yesterday not today
they cant remember
there are more of us now in the parking place
good
and we have the posters now
oh got printed good job
ill continue with the neighbours
keep surveying
right
depending on the results of the survey
well focus on particular objects and tasks
we finish with you now
and to to the police department
your detective officer promised
to help out with the security cam footage
its very important and it may help us a lot
next
since the night is coming
the guy needs to sleep somewhere
its not summer outside
well search the doorways
well ask the same officer for the doorcodes
hopefully he wont refuse
so from the very beginning

i could with you

you needed a family not i
i could have managed without it really
i just should have start
to live on my own somewhere

fox 1 doing the calling
aaalyoooshaaa
aaalyoooshaaa
aaalyoooshaaa
fox 1 the calling finished
lets go guys
this is it
can you do it one more time
hes not there on the other cameras
neither on the way to school not to the mall
to which they all go
as if theres a magnet there
well theres food and it looks nice
not on the way to the bus or the routetaxi
if he wanted to go towards the metro
and then to the train station for example
the options are
either he turned
where there are no street cameras
and there are a lot of such places
or he chose to walk so that he avoids them
which is unlikely
or he was taken
what do you mean taken
kidnapped
are you serious
you dont joke about such things
it is impossible
unfortunately sometimes it is
and what do you have
yesterdays survey was useless
it took a long time according to us
you should initiate a investigating case
maybe even a criminal one
excuse me
we handed out the posters
to emergencies and shops
to the kiosks
hello
darling i missed you
will you come tonight you promised
i dont think so i must take part in the search

without exceptions
any unidentified boy aged 1013
brought by the police or ambulance
no matter if he fits the description
is our case
and must be visually checked
if you find one
inform me immediately
preferably by sms ill send a group there
we can go there ourselves we have a car
great but inform me nevertheless
in any case there will be and experienced searcher
who knows how to behave in this situation
if there are multiple cases
its better is there are
more that one group
thats it i cannot talk anymore well be in touch
when did you see him last
well two days before yesterday i think
on the 9th
on tuesday
yeah
where
here at school
and what did you do after school
nothing we went home
and where do you hang out usually
in the courtyard i dont know
okay in the courtyard and where else
nowhere
oh come on
in the mall probably
no our parents dont let us go there
are you some babies do you stay in the courtyard
playing in a sandbox or something
why babies we play football
on a hockey playground
and do you have a bike
yes
so where do you usually go to with alyosha
well nowhere
in the block around the buildings
look young man
if you know where he is
but youre not telling because he asked you
fine dont tell
i understand it really
the main thing is that you are sure
that you friend is safe alive and well
we are the grownups
well run well search its not a problem
just like the hideandseek right
do you play a game with us
i really dont know where he is
okay i believe you
and where can he be
i know you have a camp
to be honest i dont know where it is
but i really know that it exists
you chatted about it on vkontakte
if you really dont know where alyosha is
but you assume he could be there
you have to tell us where this place is
because you friend might be in danger now
look bro well find him anyway
but it can be too late and it will be sad
whats more important for you
a friend or some place
youll find plenty of other places like that
and if you gave some oath
believe me you arent breaking it now
because youre saving your friend
and he really needs your help
its in the forest
the camp
okay good

in this case we search
all the complex of buildings and surroundings
i remind
mark dangerous strange places
inform about them but dont go inside
there are professionals for that
dont increase the suffering dont get hurt
if something like this happens
we stop the search
and focus our efforts
on helping the partner
first contact the coordinator
that is me
medical assistance is provided
by the doctor only hes there
until he comes
the runner in case hes physically restrained
stays untouched we talk to him
we comfort him verbally
wait for the doctor

grandpa pihto to ivan
came to the river no traces
how copy
acknowledged come back
roger
what about in the river
we dont look for the dead
its done by the police or the extreme measures
if there are reasons
crew go back
return to the base
fox 1 were going back
with regard to the absence of a positive result
in the search of a runner and
a sharp worsening of weather conditions
i make a decision
to change the status of the search
we start an intense informing of the public
about a child gone missing
we start the total poster putup
bus stops underground crossings
doorways light poles
benches information boards
fences shops if theres permission
of the administrator
as usually
now i need 2 groups of 5 people
to check the doorways
great well sort it out
the others get on the putup
okay lets go
