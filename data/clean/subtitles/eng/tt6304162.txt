  good afternoon 
  good afternoon 
 215 roubles 
  hey  in case the family status
of an employee of the company changes 
will they realize it up there 
  sooner or later 
during some team building or company party 
because everybody has to be
with a family  with children 
and why do you ask 
  just curious 
during all this time i ve been working here 
i ve never seen anybody divorce 
  that s because it s our corporate policy 
you know yourself 
people divorce only due to
some natural reasons 
death and so on 
  so you mean nobody ever got divorced 
last new year s corporate party
one of the it guys
brought a fake wife
with two daughters 
  no way 
  because he got divorced with his real wife 
this is how he was overcoming the situation 
  wow 
  where he found a fake wife  
i don t know 
maybe hired 
looks like nobody found out about it yet 
he still works here 
maybe he married one more time 
  i see 
so  if you divorce and then quickly remarry 
you can get unnoticed 
  if your families aren t too close friends 
  my family isn t 
  then who cares 
  well  yeah 
look  and where from do you know about this it guy 
  well  first of all 
he s not an it guy 
i said it on purpose 
he s from a different department 
don t ask from which 
second of all 
i know it from the source 
well  you got it 
by the way 
i haven t talked to him for a long time 
lack of time 
just
saying hello to each other  sometimes  from afar 
  you won t tell anybody  right 
  just like during a confession  don t worry 
  what do you think 
will there be the end of the world 
  for sure 
will you hand me some material to work with 
have anything 
god said we must share 
  maybe i ll get something in the evening 
  this will a mutual benefit  don t worry 
  mhm 
  oh my   
  he s worrying a lot 
  good  let him worry 
  he s suffering  poor guy 
  good  they all are masters at messing things up 
how about cleaning things 
  you think he s worrying about the kid 
yeah  right 
ha has loans from the bank  he s afraid of getting fired 
you know  his boss is all so orthodox  to the bone 
  a fundamentalist 
  mhm 
has a huge beard while wearing a brioni costume 
  a glamorous guy 
  indeed 
he started an orthodox shariah there 
you get a job only if you re married 
and baptized  of course 
and during our vacations we had a pilgrimage
all around the temples 
  yeah  i remember  on the other hand 
it s kind of cool  exoticism 
  oh come on  it s so boring 
  bend your leg  shall we 
  but he has a big salary for that 
so  as i see  he s really getting nervous 
  you think he can really get fired 
  the hell i know 
i really hope 
  and what about the alimony 
  ouch 
are you kidding me 
  hey  there s very little left  relax 
my friend told me once
that her boss is fond of extreme sports 
  really 
  yes 
so he s taking them to parachute or to canoe
or to downhill ski 
  downhill skiing is cool 
  well   
the knee of my friend broke 
so she had to wear a cast for half a year 
goodbye the ligament 
  hardcore   
  so some of them started buying
certificates on the internet
about the heart condition
or the blood pressure 
  and 
  got fired 
  if you re ill  go to a hospital 
  holy crap 
  so  the temples of yours 
those prayers   all that is still bearable 
turn over 
  well  i don t know  i think   
vacations mean summer  sunshine  a beach 
an all inclusive hotel   
  and what does your new boyfriend say about this 
  he s fine with it 
he s so  you know  up to date 
  well  he has the money 
he s healthy  why not be up to date 
  knock on the wood   
  don t worry  i m not a hoodoo 
  i m not superstitious  too  it was just a reflex 
  so  is he divorced  any kids 
  yeah  divorces 3 years ago 
the daughter is grown up  she s studying abroad 
in portugal  i think 
and works there  too 
  and how old is he 
 47 
  he s looking good 
  he does some chinese exercises 
doesn t smoke  almost doesn t drink 
  i m even jealous 
so  i even it up 
  just a bit 
  and how does he feel about your boy 
  nothing particular 
looks like this boy of mine hates me 
he s just like his father 
even starts to smell like him 
  secondary sexual characteristics 
he s growing up 
and did you want him to stay an angel
all the time 
  he may look like an angel 
  oh  hi  will you wait 
  but he s actually all so spiky 
he almost tore me during childbirth  
didn t want to get out 
i was delivering almost 24 hours 
  yeah  the life is hard   
just like my tyke 
everytime i look at her i realize a sad fact
that she s just like her father 
i hope he died there in his kapotnya 
  look 
  yeah   
but you know  she doesn t drink 
i told her that i ll kill her immediately 
she s a girl of a character 
but not like her father  more like his mother 
she s such a bitch 
  i forgot  how old is your daughter 
 19  but she s real stupid 
well no  she s smart 
she finished the school  exams 
but doesn t want to study anymore 
no matter what you do 
all she wants is to roam around 
i tell her   if you get pregnant  your life is ruined 
don t count on me  
and she says   i have safe sex  
  well  at least that 
  i don t know how she ll live further 
no profession  no desire whatsoever 
i tell her   who do you want to be  
 a member of parliament  
i say   study while you still have time  
she says   you don t need to study to be an mp  
what can i say 
  so your daughter is clever 
  it s because she s just like me 
  yes 
  zhenya  come downstairs  please 
  mhm 
  why you don t tell me anything 
  what do you mean 
  how did it go with the flat yesterday 
what did the buyers say 
  they said they ll think

i would have certainly told you

different story 
there was no one who made me feel so happy

  zhenya   
  what 
what s the matter 
something s wrong 
 voices in the background  suggesting to have a drink 
  girls  let s drink for love 
for love 
  you my beauties 
let s make a selfie 
  for love and selfie 
  hey 
you re asleep 
it s not fair 
i love you 
do you hear 
i never loved anyone 
only my mother when i was a child 
and she was so blunt with me 
never caressed 
never said a kind word 
only the discipline  the order  the studying 
wicked and lonely wretch 
  she is alive and well  i hope 
  alive 
and actually quite healthy 
we don t talk much 
every time i call we end up in a scandal 
even later on  i cannot understand why 
who started it 
only with you i realized what love is 
i didn t love my husband 
and before him i had no one 
and even with him  i got pregnant by mistake 
he was so happy  suggested to get married 
 everything is fine  we re together  
but i didn t want that 
i was so scared 
i was afraid to do the abortion 
i was afraid to keep it 
didn t want it so much 
when i was delivering i thought i was gonna die 
they had me in critical care 
and then  when they brought him 
i couldn t even look at him 
like some kind of disgust 
i even didn t have milk 
later it somehow got better 
some life started 
some 
  un love 
  you can t live in un love 
  even now  when i look at him or think about him 
like right now 
it seems like i have made
some unforgivable mistake 
i blame him and i blame myself 
how much do i want to be happy 
i m a bitch  ain t i 
  of course 
you re the loveliest bitch in the world 
  you really love me 
  come to me 
  yeah  hello 
  did you see alyosha yesterday evening 
  no  i didn t come home last night  why 
  the school called right now 
they said he wasn t there
neither today not yesterday 
  what do you mean 
and who called 
  the head teacher 
  the head teacher 
and what did she say 
  that he wasn t there 
neither today  not yesterday  are you deaf or what 
  had he been in at home 
  i don t know 
i came yesterday at night 
i thought he s sleeping 
woke up late today 
i thought he s already left  as usually 
his phone is off  has he called you 
  no 
  dear god   
  stop panicking  he ll come back 
what else will he do 
we need to call that   
the friend of his 
  i already have  he hadn t seen him either 
neither today  not yesterday 
  i see 
and where are you now 
  at home  where else 
  and you fuckin cannot understand if he
had been home or not 
  i damn cannot 
  why 
it s easy 
  then come and see yourself 
  i m at work  in case you didn t know 
  we haven t heard of him
for more than 24 hours 
do you get this or not 
  maybe he s in the elevator
right now  for example 
i think you re exaggerating 
he must have done something
and is afraid now that
you ll give him a beating 
that s why he s roaming around somewhere   
  so  i m at fault now  right 
  you even   
you don t even know if he had been at home or not 
he probably had 
hello 
hello 
  listen 
i m calling the police right now 
and you can keep sitting at your work
and speculate what may had been
and what may not 
got it 
blockhead 
  dasha  look 
one office worker
says to another office worker 
 what car do you have  
 volkswagen passat 
 and i have volkswagen credit 
  so funny 
  look 
one office worker   
  wait wait wait  seryozha   
  it was funny 
  i ve finished 
  good  thank you 
take that 
wait for me in the car 
we have one more call 
  okay 
  what can i say 
i see no crime here 
  what crime 
  you know  sometimes
the parents finish off their child
and then claim that the child got lost 
  you thought that way about me 
  that s the version we check the first 
here we have a  runner   the usual case 
12 years old  a rebel heart 
full of hormones 
he ll roam around for a couple of days
and will come back 
well  we can  of course  go to the department 
spend a couple of hours filling a detailed form  
and probably already not today 
at least because your husband
must be present as well 
and even then 
i think this case won t go further
than the material checking 
  you say there s no crime 
and what if he was kidnapped 
cause i can t even imagine
where he can be now 
  he must be roaming somewhere around the block 
he won t last long 
he s used to the comfort  and it s right here 
they come back to such families
that you couldn t even imagine 
cause the street is not a home 
no matter how shitty the latter is 
and considering the kidnapping 
this is how it goes 
first  there s the material checking  it means 
examining the parents  relatives 
friends  possible witnesses and so on 
we don t have enough staff for it 
plus  there are a lot of other cases  
robberies  murders  burglaries  thuggery 
thus  collecting materials can last
a couple of days 
if by then the  runner  doesn t come back 
the searching operations begin 
and if during them we find reasons 
i e  factual evidence of murder or kidnapping 
then criminal proceedings are initiated 
but it is initiated by
the investigating committee 
you know yourself  how long can it take 
the writing itself takes forever 
during this time they usually
come back and run away again 
  so  you won t do anything  right 
  ma am  i m explaining the real situation 
we must react and we will 
but in this particular case
we physically don t have time or staff
to keep chasing every teenager 
  i got it 
the case will be thrown to a trash bin  right 
and what do i do 
just sit and wait till he returns 
and what if he doesn t return 
  facts are stubborn things   
in most cases
the teenage  runners  come back
in a week s time 
in 10 days at most 
what i can advise is 
if you really want to start looking for him 
go to the internet 
to the web page of the search and rescue squad 
call them  give them all the information 
they ll tell which information they need 
they are volunteers  not a government service 
they work 24 hours  for free 
without any bureaucracy 
a well developed highly efficient
algorithm of actions 
where do i know from 
have been collaborating  productively 
look  here s my card 
your phone number
has already been written down 
we ll stay in touch 
  is that it 
  for now  yes 
  unreal 
  listen 
if it were any other officer 
it would have been
much harsher and less informative 
and it s not because i m so kind 
it s because i save my time  yours
and volunteers  
who will start searching
the sooner you contact them 
and they will find your fool
somewhere in the streets or in a mall 
and most probably  at some place of his friend s 
whose parents went away for a day or two
so that he s alone now 
so  take actions 
or keep waiting  it s up to you 
  when have you spoken to him last time 
  i just saw him leaving for school 
  good afternoon 
  good afternoon 
  i m sorry  there are traffic jams 
  take a seat  engage yourself 
my name s ivan 
i m the coordinator
of the search and rescue squad 
  yes  my wife told me on the phone 
  great  then  let s start  i mean  continue 
so  i say it one more time
so that there are fewer questions 
now i m going to carefully ask you
about your son  alyosha 
while other searchers are surveying
the neighbours  possible witnesses 
on the streets  in the shops 
everywhere where he could have been seen 
yes  lena 
  the neighbours got nothing 
  nothing at all 
  nobody has seen him  neither yesterday  not today 
they can t remember 
there are more of us now  in the parking place 
  good 
  and we have the posters now 
  oh  got printed  good job 
  i ll continue with the neighbours 
  keep surveying 
right 
depending on the results of the survey 
we ll focus on particular objects and tasks 
we finish with you now
and to to the police department 
your detective officer promised
to help out with the security cam footage 
it s very important and it may help us a lot 
next 
since the night is coming 
the guy needs to sleep somewhere 
it s not summer outside 
we ll search the doorways 
we ll ask the same officer for the door codes 
hopefully he won t refuse 
so  from the very beginning 
alyosha sleptsov 
12 years old

her paranoia is only progressing with time   
so much hate    it s crazy 
  you think you re full of love 
  why do you defend her 
  cause she s right 
  in what 
in saying that you can t wait till she dies 
  watch your tongue 
she s right in saying
that i shouldn t get involved with you 
shouldn t give birth  shouldn t be so foolish 
but i listened to you 
 everything s fine  we re together 
explain to me now 
how did it happen that you were promising love
and happiness 
and as a result i ve had
only pain and disappointment 
impenetrable ass full of shit 
i never even loved you 
i just couldn t live with her any longer 
and couldn t get unstuck from her either 
i could with you 
i used you 
as i thought 
in reality  you used me 
you needed a family  not i 
i could have managed without it  really 
i just should have start
to live on my own somewhere 
but i got pregnant 
that s when i got depressed 
i shouldn t have listened to you 
should have made an abortion 
  yeah  you should have 
it would have been better for all of us 
  oh really  and what would have changed 
would you have changed 
haven t you made big bellied another young fool 
with pulling her into your hell 
in 10 12 years  if you still get a boner

  this is it 
  can you do it one more time 
  he s not there on the other cameras 
neither on the way to school  not to the mall 
to which they all go
as if there s a magnet there 
  well  there s food and it looks nice 
  not on the way to the bus or the route taxi 
if he wanted to go towards the metro
and then to the train station  for example 
the options are 
either he turned
where there are no street cameras  
and there are a lot of such places  
or he chose to walk so that he avoids them 
which is unlikely 
or he was taken 
  what do you mean  taken 
  kidnapped 
  are you serious  
  you don t joke about such things 
  it is impossible 
  unfortunately  sometimes it is 
and what do you have 
  yesterday s survey was useless 
it took a long time  according to us 
you should initiate a investigating case 
maybe even a criminal one 
  excuse me 
  we handed out the posters 
to emergencies and shops 
to the kiosks   
  hello

i m sorry 
  yes  yes  i understand  just tell me
what i can do 
i cannot just sit here and wait
  take the phone
and start calling all the hospitals in the district 
without exceptions 
any unidentified boy aged 10 13 
brought by the police or ambulance 
no matter if he fits the description 
is our case
and must be visually checked 
if you find one 
inform me immediately 
preferably by sms  i ll send a group there 
  we can go there ourselves  we have a car 
  great  but inform me nevertheless 
in any case  there will be and experienced searcher
who knows how to behave in this situation 
if there are multiple cases 
it s better is there are
more that one group 
that s it  i cannot talk anymore  we ll be in touch 
when did you see him last 
  well  two days before yesterday  i think 
  on the 9th 
on tuesday 
  yeah 
  where 
  here  at school 
  and what did you do after school 
  nothing  we went home 
  and where do you hang out usually 
  in the courtyard  i don t know 
  okay  in the courtyard  and where else 
  nowhere 
  oh come on 
in the mall  probably 
  no  our parents don t let us go there 
  are you some babies  do you stay in the courtyard 
playing in a sand box  or something 
  why babies  we play football
on a hockey playground 
  and do you have a bike 
  yes 
  so  where do you usually go to with alyosha 
  well  nowhere 
in the block  around the buildings 
  look  young man 
if you know where he is
but you re not telling because he asked you  
fine  don t tell 
i understand it  really 
the main thing is that you are sure
that you friend is safe  alive and well 
we are the grown ups 
we ll run  we ll search  it s not a problem 
just like the hide and seek  right 
do you play a game with us 
  i really don t know where he is 
  okay  i believe you 
and where can he be 
i know  you have a camp 
to be honest  i don t know where it is 
but i really know that it exists 
you chatted about it on vkontakte 
if you really don t know where alyosha is 
but you assume he could be there 
you have to tell us where this place is 
because you friend might be in danger now 
look  bro  we ll find him anyway 
but it can be too late  and it will be sad 
what s more important for you 
a friend or some place 
you ll find plenty of other places like that 
and if you gave some oath 
believe me  you aren t breaking it now 
because you re saving your friend 
and he really needs your help 
  it s in the forest 
the camp 
  okay  good 
what is it  a dugout  a hut 
  no  it s an abandoned building 
it s in the basement 
  is it better to go there on foot or by bike

how copy

in this case we search
all the complex of buildings and surroundings 
i remind 
mark dangerous  strange places
inform about them but don t go inside 
there are professionals for that 
don t increase the suffering  don t get hurt 
if something like this happens
we stop the search
and focus our efforts
on helping the partner 
first  contact the coordinator 
that is  me 
medical assistance is provided
by the doctor only  he s there 
until he comes 
the  runner   in case he s physically restrained 
stays untouched  we talk to him 
we comfort him verbally 
wait for the doctor
