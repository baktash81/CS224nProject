that s about enough ofthat 
sorry 
i ve been an educator
for 31  3 years   
and in that time 
i ve seen a lot of bad eggs 
i say   eggs   because
at the elementary level   
we are not dealing
with fully developed individuals 
i see a bad egg
when i look at your niece 
she is a twiddler  a dreamer   
a silly heart
and she is a jabberbox 
and  frankly   
i don t think she takes a thing   
in her life or her career
as a student seriously 
she s only six 
that is not a valid excuse 
i hear that every day and i dismiss it 
i don t want to know a six year old
who isn t a dreamer or a silly heart 
i sure don t want to know one who
takes their student career seriously 
i don t have a college degree 
i don t even have a job 
does anyone have a special story
to tell about something that happened 
my uncle was microwaving my socks   
and the dog threw up on the couch
for about an hour 
honest  why was your uncle
microwaving your socks 
he can t get the goddamn
washing machine to work

but i really could use your advice
vis a vis chanice 
i ve been   
stringing her along
for about eight years now 
maybe you could fii gure out
what the hell is wrong with me 
i did such a greatjob earning

you fat sucker

you son ofa bitch

hey  i m not sorry  all right 
i ain t sorry for shit 
what do you see in that guy anyway 
i can t for the life of me
fii gure that one out 
don t answer  you don t have to 
i appreciate the confession 
thanks a lot 
but my problems with buck
go deeper   
than a misunderstanding
with a neighbor lady 
don t you think he loves you 
if he does  he d never say it 
what if he did 
then i would suspect
he needed a new set oftires 
seriously 
seriously  you re very sweet
to talk about this 
but you don t understand
the bigger picture 
buck s a charming man
who wants to remain a boy forever 
at my age  that doesn t make
for a lasting relationship 
i think he d make
a wonderful husband and father 
  you do 
  oh  yeah 
my sister and brother adore him 
he really has changed
since he s been here this week 
he really has changed 
he s responsible  caring   
loving   
and enthusiastic 
  energetic 
  and energetic and decent 
kind and  
and humble   
and honest and forthright 
sense of humor 
and he s really got
a great sense of humor 
did he put you up to this 
no 
no  i vejust gathered this
from my own observations 
  it sjust the way he is 
  really 
  really 
  oh  yeah 
so unlike him 
check this out 
hi  honey 
is the coffee ready 
a little thirsty 
by the way  i have told you
i loved you   
and it wasn t for tires  sweetheart 
it was for shocks  remember 
are they sweethearts or what 
this one s smart as a whip 
i m going to miss them like crazy 
they re beautiful children 
what happened to you 
recessive gene 
skips every nine generations 
i got it this time 
tragic 
it isn t so bad  is it 
what 
the house  the family  the kids 
oh  yeah  it was great 
this is great 
we should have done this
a long time ago  you and i 
they re here 
what are we doing 
your mother   
and your sister have to   
sort some things out 
so we re going to be very quiet
for them 
so why don t we put a button on it   
and a zipper like that   
and a lock 
i can t talk at all 
i throw the key away 
it s going to be real different 
i promise 
i love you 
shit 
  bye 
  bye  uncle buck 
could i get out the door  please 
  i m going 
  this is heavy 
bye  chanice 
thanks again  buck 
next time you re downtown 
maybe we can go out for a coffee 
we really had a good time 
i know it s ridiculous 
we did leave the house a little messy 
we tried  we re not so good at clean 
  what 
  we re going home  we re not dying 
i m saying good bye 
is that all right  nice guy 
tell the neighbors we re sorry about
having that parked in the driveway 
  he s getting a new company car monday 
  the hell i am 
  it s good for another 1 00 000 miles
