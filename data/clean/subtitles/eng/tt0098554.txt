takes their student career seriously

i appreciate the confession
thanks a lot

go deeper
than a misunderstanding
with a neighbor lady
dont you think he loves you
if he does hed never say it
what if he did
then i would suspect
he needed a new set oftires
seriously
seriously youre very sweet
to talk about this
but you dont understand
the bigger picture
bucks a charming man
who wants to remain a boy forever
at my age that doesnt make
for a lasting relationship
i think hed make
a wonderful husband and father

oh yeah
my sister and brother adore him
he really has changed
since hes been here this week
he really has changed
hes responsible caring
loving
and enthusiastic
energetic
and energetic and decent
kind and
and humble
and honest and forthright
sense of humor
and hes really got
a great sense of humor
did he put you up to this
no
no ivejust gathered this
from my own observations
itsjust the way he is
really
really
oh yeah
so unlike him

a long time ago you and i
theyre here
