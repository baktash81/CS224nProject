matter much money
oh mrs lincoln youre right
wealth offer advantage
however since ancestors founded gatlin
holdings give little leverage
example donate old mill
say drug rehabilitation center
oh god
land wayward dog motel stands
closure would cause little inconvenience
one two gentlemen
youd travel town see lady friends
wives believe
attending yet another meeting
american civil war reenactment society
might presume
matter comfortably laid rest
im afraid evil kind
god creator condemn hellfire
along terrorists atheists homosexuals
democrats liberals socialists
greenpeace unnatural abominations
dear mrs lincoln
would welcome kind fire
might give opportunity
burn unfortunate hat youre wearing
sarafine
