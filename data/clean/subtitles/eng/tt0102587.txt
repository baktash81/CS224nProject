began second taste country life
could yellow flower produce bright red
told sad tale old days
girls didnt gloves
bare hands would get pricked thorns
blood made red deep
could imagine resentment
mustve felt toward fancy city girls
make handful rouge took nearly lbs petals
rouge literally worth weight gold
petals washed trodden exposed air sun
petals oxidize gradually turn red
days
fermentation turns bright red become sticky
pounded wrung balls sundried finally become
basic ingredient rouge
liquid pressing wasnt wasted either
red pigment yellow broth
used dye fabric
lets go dye cloth
safflower best
cheer pretty color
village girls chance makeup kimonos
safflower dye brought color drab lives
yellow pigment dissolves water leaving clothes light pink
pretty
machines take away work
petals still need picking every day
rouge cakes soon mould flowers wait one
sooner done picking bloom
rains come work continues early hours
day flew
pleasantly tired thought flowerpickers old
couldve worked like child
school essays wouldve really interesting
