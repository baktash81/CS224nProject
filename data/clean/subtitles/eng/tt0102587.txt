yes  harvesting rice 
this year  i m picking safflower 
safflower 
thanks to you  i finally have family
in the countryside 
so  i m making the most of it 
give me a break 
rather than stay in that old house 
why not treat yourself
to a fancy hotel for once 
maybe you d meet a nice boy 
no way  you mean
a hotel like  onoya  
 onoya  
not that again 
you ve got to get over it 
let go of that baggage from the past 
my sisters  of course  would never
go to a place like atami 
grandma   
almost done 
let s go to another bath 
we just went 
only to the swan bath 
bored to tears  i went alone
to the brothers grimm bath
the mermaid bath  the lemon bath 
and the violet bath 
one after the other 
it s enormous 
when i got to the roman bath 
my head was spinning 
it s amazing   
and i fainted 
and with that  my trip was over 
followed by endless weeks of vacation 
the other day  my sisters and i
were reminiscing 
we couldn t stop laughing
as the memories came flooding back 
had one before 
no  it s my first time 
i m the one who asked for it 
yeah  we know 
where did you buy it 
senbikiya in ginza 
must have been expensive 
how do we eat it 
slice it into rings 
but how 
i don t know 
didn t you ask in the store 
we ll eat it next sunday 
why not now  
we don t know how 
i ll have a banana 
me too 
strange fruit they have
in those hot countries 
i m home 
i know how to eat the pineapple 
really 
i ll take that 
mind your fingers 
wouldn t a carving knife be best 
what a nice smell 
it smells so good 
i see 
get plates  quick 
okay 
let us eat 
it s hard 
it s not very good 
not so sweet 
nothing like the canned stuff 
live long enough and you see
lots of different things 
  you can have mine 
  mine too 
it s delicious   
don t force yourself 
you ll get a stomachache 
what a let down 
bananas taste much better 
you re so right 
bananas are still the king of fruits 
i ll have one now 
the king of fruit is   
the banana  after all 
the year i fainted at the baths and
had my first pineapple   
the beatles came to japan 
started the rock  n roll band
and electric guitar craze 
my sister nanako  a freshman in
art school  was up on all the trends 
yeah  the beatles lyrics are great 
when she wore a mini skirt  she d
cover her bottom going up the stairs 
my clever sister  yaeko  was crazy
about some takarazuka actress 
yaeko   
i told you to knock 
my sisters  memories are
mainly of fashion and pop trends 
for them  1966 is the
height of nostalgia 
whereas i was only ten years old 
my favorite band had yet to debut    
my only memories are the back and
forth between school and home 
   mine was pinned on the wall 
that s nice 
and it might be entered in
an essay contest 
so  teacher kept it 
  i d be so happy   
  you didn t finish lunch again 
why do you hide the pickles
inside the bread 
 cause i hate them 
i ve got to throw it away 
what a waste 
such a picky eater 
i d rather you were a good eater
than a good essay writer 
how can you drink that stuff 
milk s okay  it s onions i hate 
i m leaving carrots
so i ve got no choice 
who decided we can only
leave one thing 
shall i drink it 
would you 
you ll eat my onions next time 
  carrots 
  we re allowed one thing 
two bowls is gross 
people who run in the corridor   
   when the hall monitor says
stop  should be punished 
how are you gonna do that 
they shouldn t do it 
that s right 
you might bump into someone 
if i bumped into you
i d bounce a mile 
get lost 
running is no big deal 
i agree 
  let s change the rule 
  but we already decided 
raise your hand if you want to speak 
  here 
  miss tani 
the hall monitor
should chase the offender 
catch them and punish them 
mr  suzuki 
then the hall monitor should
be punished for running too 
he s right  he s right 
way to go 
he s right 
miss tani 
the hall monitor shouldn t
be punished because   
   it s like a policeman
chasing a speeding car 
any objections 
it makes sense   
no more running 
so  the hall monitor
can chase offenders 
any other issues 
miss tani 
  her again 
  busybody 
be quiet 
some people don t finish lunch 
i just read an article
on the vietnam war 
there are many
unfortunate people overseas 
we re very lucky 
lucky to have you near me 
we should be grateful for our food 
we re allowed to leave
one thing on our plates 
but i think it s wrong 
goody two shoes 
  it can t hurt to leave one thing 
  let s all leave milk   
  give it to someone else   
  of course 
  people hide leftovers in bread 
  that s cheating 
i hate school food 
if you want to speak 
raise your hand 
what a revolting situation 
that night in bed 
after chatting to my sisters
more memories from fifth grade
came rushing back 
our pet dog      school sports day   
being scared by gross
horror comics    
longing for an electric
pencil sharpener   
so many little details 
one after the other   
playing in my head like a movie 
almost overpowering me 
is there a miss okajima here 
that s her 
hirota in our class
says he likes you 
let s go 
we ll say we told you 
told you 
where is it 
over there 
shuji hirota and taeko oka jima
lt s true 
what s he like 
  no idea 
  me  neither 
taeko  you sure you don t know him 
no    of course not    not at all 
which one is hirota 
it s the girls from room 5 
hirota  they re looking for you 
i m here 
don t write silly things on the wall 
taeko told us to tell you 
i didn t write anything 
you said you liked
okajima in room 5 
you did 
so  we wrote it for you 
i love you so much    
but you re so far away    
like gazing up at   
goodbye 
a far distant star 
taeko 
we just went to see hirota 
we told him not to
write things on walls 
tsuneko 
ah  no running 
aren t you glad 
5th grade  room 4
over here 
see  that s him 
what  hirota likes taeko 
he s amazing  a real star 
you mean baseball 
only tono can hit his pitches 
really 
our team plays his
in the next game 
go  go  hirota 
go for it  tono 
hit it  tono

go for it  hirota 
taeko s watching you 
hit it  tono 
way to go  hirota 
strike him out 
don t you dare cheer their side 
of course not 
go  go  tono 
hiro  hiro  hirota 
hit it 
one leg stance 
wow 
way to go  hirota 
i knew nothing about baseball 
but even i could tell he was superb 
go  go  hirota 
what s up  taeko 
between the cold and the excitement 
i ran to the bathroom five times 
over here  over here 
game 
room 4 wins 
thank you for the game 
you were great hirota 
good job 
you were amazing 
it was all your fault 
how come 
you don t know anything 
if tono couldn t hit him 
how could we 
that s right 
you missed the throw and
three runs scored 
that s not true 
coach said he d buy us ice cream 
  really 
  great 
hirota  you should go see her 
yeah  you should 
i m going home 
what s the matter  taeko 
look  she left 
um   
   that stuff   
   on the wall   
rainy day or   
cloudy or sunny day   
which do you like 
cloudy 
me too 
rainy day or cloudy or sunny day 
which do you like 
me  too 
i didn t intend the ten year old me
to come on this trip 
but somehow  once she showed up
she wouldn t leave me alone 
but why me in the 5th grade 
second hour  all boys play baseball 
all girls to the gym 
how come 
baseball  great 
today i m going to talk about
something very important 
you ll leave grade school 
then junior school then high school 
then become grown ups and have babies 
a woman s body prepares
to have babies 
did you know 
really 
mom told me
when i was in fourth grade 
since i m an early developer 
early developer 
that s right 
she said tall girls or big girls
get their periods early 
i bet those other girls
already have theirs 
  are you gonna buy them 
  i am 
i knew it 
you ll buy them  too  right 
well    yeah 
i think you should 
nurse said
we all need them eventually 
that s true 
the girls are buying underpants
in the infirmary 
did you know 
no 
but why 
how come you re buying underpants 
it s because   
umm   
why is the school selling underpants 
are they for swimming 
you told nakayama 
why did you do that  
you shouldn t tell boys 
it s supposed to be our secret 
it s because she likes him   
did he ask you 
what s going on 
she told nakayama about periods 
no 
he ll tell everyone 
i said to keep it secret 
you trust him 
  oh no   
  boys are disgusting 
now they ll be looking up our skirts 
pervert 
looking up skirts was all the rage
and periods became an obsession 
you got your period 
cut it out 
second period break 
idiot 
ouch 
come here 
you ve got a period 
no  i don t 
it s all rie s fault 
i m sorry 
what for 
for telling nakayama 
it doesn t matter 
the nurse said it s very important 
i know 
i started when i was in fourth grade 
really 
that s why i skip p  e  sometimes 
you skip p  e  with a period 
mom said i should 
he even said he felt sorry for us 
you told him about skipping p  e  
he promised not to tell the others 
so  then they ll think
all girls who skip p  e  have periods 
you think so 
of course 
please excuse taeko from p  e 
because of her cold 
i m not missing p  e 
your cold will get worse 
then i ll stay home 
no  you don t have a fever 
then i ll do p  e 
fine  go ahead 
don t blame me if it gets worse 
see you later 
since when was she so fond of p  e  
you re bright red 
she s right 
are you okay 
i have a cold 
you have a fever 
you should skip p  e 
yeah  you should 
i ll go tell the teacher 
no  don t 
why not 
mom already wrote a note 
there s no problem then 
out of the way 
ouch 
i m missing p  e  too 
just like you 
lucky them 
i wish i could play  too 
do you   
   are you having a period 
yes 
i m not  i have a cold 
i know  you re sick 
just sick  that s all 
a period isn t a sickness 
i could still play   
i m gonna catch a period 
don t touch it  don t touch it 
that was close 
almost caught it   
over here  over here 
 catch a period  
what a silly thing to say 
it s no laughing matter 
taeko 
it s the period pair 
no  we re not 
stupid boys 
you re so calm about it 
mom said it s nothing
to be ashamed of 
i guess so  but   
like it or not 
a butterfly must first   
live as a caterpillar
before it can fly away 
maybe i remember those days because
i was going through the
caterpillar stage 
something definitely changed
when i started working 
at work and at play we girls were
livelier and more spirited than guys 
it was like
we d finally found our wings 
but looking back now 
maybe we were just
flexing them pointlessly 
perhaps the fifth grade me
was tagging along
with a message for me to reflect
and rethink my life 
anyway  i decided to sleep
the rest of the way 
ouch 
excuse me 
has the tokyo train gone 
was that your train 
no   
taeko okajima  right 
yes  that s correct   
thank goodness 
the car s this way 
excuse me  but who are you 
you don t remember 
of course you don t 
i m toshio  kazuo s second cousin 
oh  i see   
what s so funny 
nothing  sorry 
i thought you were trying
to steal my bag 
that s terrible 
didn t i ask your name 
yes  you did 
i just thought    sorry   
i beg your pardon 
no problem 
where s kazuo 
he asked me last night
to come pick you up
it s been raining 
yeah  but it ll clear today 
i should ve used my dad s car
but i like mine better 
it s a little tight 
may i leave it on 
sure 
this is unusual music 
it s a hungarian group 
hungarian 
you know a lot about it 
a little  it s farmer s music 
i like it because i m a farmer 
cool 
right 
remember last year s party
at the farmhouse 
a bunch of guys
turned up  right 
maybe you don t remember 
they came to check out
the girl from tokyo 
i was one of them 
watch out  jerk 
i heard you re picking safflower 
do you dye fabric 
just curious 
safflower s kind of unusual 
well  maybe not for you 
it s known as a famous
local product but
hardly anyone grows it 
  wasn t it big in the old days 
  for the merchants  sure 
they got rich  but for farmers 
it was just another crop 
do you know  in time whose skin
will it grace  this crimson flower 
the famous basho poem 
i read it before coming 
is that so 
i only learned it last night 
i also read that the flower pickers
couldn t afford to wear
the rouge they made 
is that where you had the barbeque 
there ll be another this year  too 
are market reforms making
agriculture difficult 
absolutely 
as things go  japanese farming
might just collapse 
all of sudden  one day 
but then again 
anything worth struggling for
will be hard work 
isn t it the same in the city 
yes 
but fewer people live for their work 
what about you 
me 
i don t live for my job
but i don t hate it either 
i could farm twenty four hours a day 
it s fascinating
to raise living things 
you have livestock 
not that  we ve got some animals 
but i m talking about rice  apples 
cherries  they re all living things 
if we take good care of them 
i feel like
they ll do their best for us 
listen to me preach 
not at all  i get what you mean 
to tell the truth  i used to
work in an office 
i only just started farming 
is that right 
that s why i m so enthusiastic 
it s very important 
i quit work and joined
my friend s organic farm 
people said i m nuts 
but i don t regret it 
organic farm 
 grown with no
artificial chemicals whatsoever  
just blood  sweat and tears 
we use all natural stuff 
no pesticides or anything 
i ve seen the labels 
 no chemicals used 
but it s not just that 
we bring out the plant s life force 
it s cool   
like lending nature a hand 
sounds easy  but it s damn hard work 
i was told to take you straight
to the fields 
yes  i m starting right away 
not going to rest 
don t you pick the flowers early
while the thorns are still soft 
that s right  but   
i m trying to become an early riser 
that s why i took the night train 
you re certainly eager 
there it is 
 morning  everyone 
great to have you back  taeko 
thanks for having me 
grandma  you re looking well 
welcome back dear 
aren t you tired 
no  not at all 
we made your bed just in case 
that s okay  look  i m raring to go 
wearing work pants too 
that s all i brought 
young people here don t wear
them any more 
you look like the real thing taeko 
that s right 
taeko 
don t 
and so began my second
taste of country life 
how could this yellow flower produce
such a bright red 
they told me a sad tale
from the old days 
the girls didn t have gloves 
and their bare hands
would get pricked by the thorns 
it was their blood that
made the red so deep 
i could imagine the resentment
they must ve felt
toward the fancy city girls 
to make a handful of rouge took
nearly 500 lbs of petals 
this rouge was literally worth
its weight in gold 
the petals are washed  trodden 
then exposed to the air and the sun 
as the petals oxidize 
they gradually turn red 
after a few more days 
fermentation turns them bright red
and they become sticky 
pounded  wrung into balls
and sun dried  they finally become
the basic ingredient of rouge 
the liquid from the pressing
wasn t wasted either 
the red pigment in the yellow broth
was used to dye fabric 
let s go dye our cloth 
safflower do your best 
cheer me up with
your pretty color 
for those village girls 
with no chance of make up or kimonos 
safflower dye brought color
into their drab lives 
the yellow pigment dissolves in water
leaving clothes a light pink 
so pretty 
machines now take away
some of the work 
but the petal s still need
picking every day 
rouge cakes soon mould 
and the flowers wait for no one 
no sooner are you done picking 
than they bloom again 
when the rains come 
work continues into the early hours 
each day flew by 
pleasantly tired  i thought about
the flower pickers of old 
if i could ve worked
like this as a child 
my school essays would ve been
really interesting 
mom  i need 5 000 yen 
5 000 yen  i can t give you that 
you said you d buy me new sneakers 
are they that much 
nonsense 
they re pumas 
  pumas 
  it s a brand 
i m not sure 
there must be cheaper ones 
how about the ones you ve got 
nobody wears them now 
everyone s getting pumas 
who s everyone 
kako  megu  yachan  nonchan 
that s only four people 
everyone s wearing them 
no  you never do your chores 
did you ask for a dress for
your barbie doll 
didn t you promise to ask only at
christmas and your birthday 
you always spoil her 
is that right  taeko 
all of a sudden 
the ten year old me was back 
but   
yaeko got a kimono and
it wasn t even her graduation 
it s for tea ceremony 
you keep asking for
lots of little stuff 
we get one or two big things 
right 
yep 
stop that 
always picky about food 
dad loves the onions  right 
anyway  that kimono will be
yours in the end 
always hand me downs 
  some people don t get anything 
  exactly 
then give me that enamel purse 
didn t you give it to her yet 
you re too old for that 
give it to her 
i don t want it 
keep the stupid purse 
then i won t give it to you 
i m not buying you a new one 
fine 
good  i actually really like it 
i hate it 
ready for dinner  take this away 
see  has to be thrown away 
what a waste 
don t throw it away  please mother 
it s your fault 
finish it yourself next time 
you three are so selfish 
father  buy me an enamel purse 
yaeko won t give me hers 
you said you didn t want it 
yeah  but   
you said it  you have to do it 
hurry up and get ready 
i ll wear these 
why is yaeko coming 
you said it was just the three of us 
because i finished my homework 
is that a problem 
it s chinese food 
the more the merrier 
grandma s not coming 
she doesn t eat oily food 
if you don t want to come  stay here 
we re going taeko 
come on slowpoke 
i don t have a purse 
lend her that enamel one 
here 
ouch 
let s go 
i m not going 
okay  let s go mother 
stay with grandma then 
not coming taeko 
no i m not 
we re off then 
i m coming too 
no shoes 
father please 
a button came off 
we didn t go out  of course 
my face was swollen and a cold towel
didn t stop the stinging 
that night i couldn t sleep
wondering why it was always me 
figuring i must ve been adopted
i cried myself to sleep 
was it the first time he hit you 
yes  the first and only time 
dad slaps me often    well  sometimes 
maybe that s easier 
when it s only once 
you can t stop thinking why 
it s hard to imagine you
a selfish brat 
a spoiled brat 
i wasn t just fussy about
onions  either 
now i don t feel like i m that bad 
wait a second 
your poor mom 
i shouldn t encourage you 
i m giving up on the pumas 
good girl 
maybe i ll slip you some pocket money 
hooray 
hey 
100 yen each 
taeko   
tomorrow   
let s go for a drive to zao 
  zao 
  yes 
you went to yamadera
last year  right 
the family said it was okay 
the views at zao were beautiful 
but zao had become famous
and touristy 
how come you re not married 
do you find that strange 
well  no  not really 
lots of women work now 
most of my friends are single 
oh  is that right 
that s right 
i see 
it s true 
right 
really  it s very common 
toshio 
in elementary school  could you
do fractions 
when they said reverse the numerator
and denominator  could you do it 
i don t remember 
i wasn t bad at math though 
i see 
lucky you 
i bet you don t remember
 cause it was easy 
maybe  why do you ask 
it seems that people who could do it
went on to have easy lives 
one girl  completely average
   not even good at math 
always could do it perfect right away 
she grew up really normal
and now has two kids 
i was no good at it 
not smart enough to know when to quit 
room 5  taeko okajima  25 points
before the test   
   we had art class 
and    um    we did blow pictures 
blow pictures 
yes  we drop paint on the paper   
and blow patterns in it 
and 
you blow like this 
really hard  right 
yes 
so  i got a headache 
from blowing so hard 
that s why you did so badly 
that s right 
i see 
do you know the answers now 
the correct answers 
well   
have yaeko help you with them 
yaeko  
that s right 
or nanako  whichever 
i ll ask nanako 
nanako s not back yet 
can i wait til after dinner 
i ll ask yaeko   
mother 
mother  mother 
what is this  
how on earth    
please teach her 
she doesn t seem to get it 
but this is beyond belief 
that s why i m asking you   
is she alright in the head 
just help her 
normally this is easy 
but that child s not normal 
taeko  your sister s going to help 
you had a headache from blowing 
didn t you 
sit 
say your times table from the top 
i know that 
i m in fif th grade already 
then why so many mistakes  
it s dividing fractions 
just flip the top
and the bottom and multiply 
they taught you that  right 
then why do you get it wrong 
yaeko  one step at a time 
what s dividing a fraction
by a fraction anyway 
two thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter means   
how would this divide
between four people  right 
so  it s one  two  three 
four  five  six   
one sixth each  right 
no  no  no  no  that s multiplication 
how come it s less when you multiply 
two thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter   
anyway 
forget about apples   
just remember to inverse and multiply 
is her sister in takarazuka 
no  s  k  d 
  she got  d  in math 
   d  
yes  and just barely 
if she got half right 
it d be worth scolding her 
right 
should you get her iq checked 
they said it was fine
when she started 
maybe she turned dumb 
remember she fell downstairs
as a baby 
right  in her walker 
i thought she was dead 
it was just a bump 
it s affecting her now 
that s it 
nonsense 
she s just no good at math 
she chats too much in class 
if she d just listen  
even an idiot can do it 
it s only two more years
until junior high 
two thirds of this apple 
divided by a quarter   
i can t even picture it 
two thirds of this 
into a quarter makes it   
even now  dividing fractions
is difficult 
we farmers give up too easily 
we just yield to the flow and
follow what they do in the cities 
let s rethink the real
meaning of prosperity 
return to the old ways of farming 
wow   
so  that explains the organic farming 
i m just quoting my friend 
but i agree with it 
it s great the way you hold onto
your memories of math class 
it wasn t meant to impress you 
people say you work
in a great place
but i could never give myself
up to it completely 
i really admire
your devotion to farming 
you re being sarcastic 
of course not 
there aren t many people like you 
farming s in total decline  right 
so we can t just carry on as normal 
we ve got to think about the future 
we help each other out 
cheer one another along 
otherwise we can t keep it up 
taeko do you ski 
i ve been with friends a few times 
come next winter  i ll teach you 
are you good 
no  but i m an instructor there 
an instructor  you must be great 
all my friends are too  it s nothing 
at last  we re in the
middle of nowhere 
 nowhere  huh 
sorry  i didn t mean it like that 
interesting point though 
city people see the trees and rivers
and are grateful for  nature  
but what you see here
is all made by man 
by man 
farmers 
  that wood 
  yes 
  those trees 
  yes 
  that stream 
  yes 
every bit has its history 
not just the fields and rice paddies 
someone s great great grandpa
planted it  or cleared it 
gathered firewood
or picked mushrooms there 
i see 
mankind battles nature
and receives from it 
they evolve together 
and create this scenery 
so without man  this wouldn t exist 
farmers can t exist without nature 
so they ve always taken great care
to give her a helping hand in return 
a collaboration between
man and nature   
that s the heart of country life 
that s why i feel so at home 
i didn t grow up here 
but somehow always felt   
my soul was at home here 
so that s it   
my back aches 
what s so great about organic farming 
only the theory  like i said   
giving nature a hand is hard work 
things haven t changed
in a hundred years 
no  even  organic  rice
uses weed killer 
there s not enough labor
to weed by hand 
you re really working hard 
how about some tea 
fantastic 
i felt like a break 
toshio let me try
a variety of things   
   until i felt i knew
all about country life 
that s great   
 behold  the crows fly home 
first one    
at last i can say this
in the right setting 
it was my line in a school play 
i was  village child a  
oh  i see 
i only ever had small roles too 
and you naoko 
only lead roles 
since there are so few of us 
these days people leave
and go to the cities 
and now there are fewer kids 
i see  but getting the big
roles must be fun 
not really  i prefer sports 
i m a pretty fast runner 
good for you 
i was always mediocre 
the sports version
of  village child a 
still  i ll never forget that line
as long as i live 
it was going to make me a star 
a star 
yes 
what kind of star 
that tiny role 
yes 
even though you weren t the lead 
yes 
because i was the most enthusiastic 
cause you were the cutest 
no  not that 
i rehearsed endlessly
in front of the mirror 
even for  village child a    
the line was so short 
i felt something missing 
 behold  the crows fly home 
first one    
i know  you made up more 
exactly 
look up there  the crows fly home 
  first one   
  then two   
  then three   
  then four   
farewell dear crows 
you take care now 
and your teacher loved it 
just the opposite 
very good everyone 
but let s stick to the script 
after all that 
it wasn t a good line 
so i didn t mind 
i wasn t discouraged at all 
i realized that i could act
even when there were no lines 
behold  the crows fly home 
  first one 
  then two 
  then three 
  then four 
that was all 
it was worth the effort 
 village child a  was a hit 
believe it or not 
people asked if i d had lessons 
teachers praised me   
then something amazing happened 
anyone home 
coming 
   and then the dynamite blew up
right in my face 
   right in my face 
what  our taeko 
we need a girl to star
in our college play 
as a service to the community 
please let your daughter perform 
a star 
we d rehearse saturday afternoons 
we wouldn t take too long 
well  but   
of course we d bring her
straight home 
i ll be in a real play 
not with a bunch of kids
but with real grown ups 
i ll be a star 
oh  oh  oh 
oh what a wonderful day
cock a doodle doo 
mother 
so  so 
a nice boy from the university
wants you in their drama 
you were so good
in the school play 
and  and 
he practically begged me 
wow that s great 
at least you re good at something 
she writes good essays too 
she s certainly better at that
than she is at math 
that s right  that s right 
i was lead in  the poor sparrow 
but no one came for me 
you see  you see 
are you going to do it 
this could lead to a career 
join the takarazuka theater 
start rehearsing now 
it s perfect timing 
acting is out 
show business people
are no good 
 show business    
don t exaggerate   
that s right  it s   
i said no 
dinner 
father s so stubborn 
why did you have to
mention a career 
  can i bathe first 
  sure 
or takarazuka    
or show business 
you know dad   
why did you say that nanako 
that s enough 
poor boy  poor boy 
don t you feel sorry for me 
we won t take much of her time 
i know but   
i beg you 
she s rather shy   
the timid type   
sorry you came so far for nothing 
poor boy  poor boy   
     such a long way from home   
poor boy
aoki s going to play the part instead 
i see 
she s boasting to everyone 
i see 
today her mom met her at school
to get her changed into a fancy dress 
a frilly thing out to here   
don t tell anyone
you got the first offer 
because that would hurt
aoki very much 
do you understand 
do you understand 
breaking through the waves
shooting through the clouds
where is it heading  hyokkori pumpkin
island  where will it take us 
something special waits for us 
just over the horizon
there  ll be hard times 
there  ll be sad times 
but we ll never lose heart
we hate to cry 
so let s laugh instead
let s go 
hyokkori pumpkin island 
poor you 
i joined the drama group
in high school 
i couldn t forget what had happened 
and then 
it was a lot of fun  acting and all   
but it wasn t for me 
as for becoming a star   
that was a joke 
but   
i guess dads are the same all over 
when i was in high school 
i so wanted to live in tokyo 
i even wrote to my cousin
about schools there 
did you really 
i gave up  but it annoyed me
to hear other guys
bragging about life in tokyo 
not anymore though 
i respect my dad   
he s an expert farmer 
but i know how you felt 
mine s just a funny story 
no it s the same  i understand 
but we ll never lose heart  we hate
to cry  so let s laugh instead 
i also watched
hyokkori pumpkin island 
really 
machine gun dandy was so cool 
he was my hero 
of course 
those songs were full
of encouragement 
what was that other one    
 if today s no good 
you ll have tomorrow 
 if tomorrow s no good 
you ll have the next day 
 if that s no good 
there ll be another 
 there s always a tomorrow 
what a weird song 
that song  about putting things off 
toshio took
in a positive  affirmative way 
i liked his approach to life 
you re going tomorrow 
thank you for having me for so long 
thank you  my dear 
do you like it here 
very much  i feel so at home 
glad to hear it 
i ve lived here all my life 
been to tokyo just once 
for your sister s wedding 
you think it s better than tokyo 
without a doubt 
tokyo s packed with cars  buildings   
people shouldn t live like that 
this is a different world 
you really like it here then 
yes  the nice surroundings 
the kind people   
taeko 
why don t you live here  with toshio 
since his brother moved to tokyo 
why don t you stay here
and marry toshio 
granny 
mother    you ve gone too far 
taeko s shocked 
please think it over 
don t pay any attention  she s joking 
joking  right  granny 
no  i m serious 
don t deny you wouldn t like it 
it s not a matter of what we d like   
of course we d love it 
but taeko s a city person 
of course 
but she loves it here 
she works so hard on the land 
it s a joy to watch 
there d be nothing better
than her marrying toshio 
you re being rude 
you re embarrasing her 
she s got a decent job in tokyo 
besides  she s older than him 
there are jobs in yamagata too 
please don t be angry 
most of the young wives
work these days  so   
what re you talking about 
she s only been here
twice on holiday 
suddenly bringing this up   
you re upsetting her 
so you re against it 
i didn t say that 
i said let s be realistic 
we don t even know
how toshio feels 
one look at him and it s obvious 
don t dismiss it before
we ve asked her 
taeko 
let her be 
see what you did 
you can t rush these things 
i don t think i was wrong 
i d never even thought
of being a farmer s wife 
i was strangely moved 
even imagining it might be possible 
if only i could ve replied 
 i d love to       like in a movie 
but i couldn t 
suddenly my love of the country 
and my play farming 
seemed so phony 
declaring my love for country life
based on a ten day vacation 
now felt so embarrassing 
then with no warning    
everyone seeing right through me 
it was unbearable 
i ain t shaking hands with you 
that shirt he wore today    
what about it 
tanaka  s old shirt 
don t tell anyone 
when it s his turn to feed the ducks 
he takes the bread home 
did you see his hands 
glad he s not sitting next to me 
poor taeko 
have him switch places 
he should sit with the boys 
right taeko 
i don t mind 
you shouldn t talk like that 
you don t mind 
don t be a goody goody 
don t you dare tell anyone
what we said 
i ll beat you up 
don t go 
what are you doing out here 
nothing  taking a walk 
you re getting wet  quick  get in 
a little souvenir 
some of mom s pickles 
please don t go back yet 
why not 
just drive    anywhere 
something wrong 
i knew a boy named abe 
he came from another school 
he sat next to me 
he once said 
 i ain t shaking hands with you  
his family was poor 
he never had sports gear 
always picking his nose
or wiping it on his sleeve   
and if i complained or
even dared frown at him 
he d threaten to hit me 
i hated it  i longed for
the end of the term 
so we could change seats 
i hated holding hands
in dance class 
hated having to lend him
my homework 
the girls gossiped
and called him names 
but i wouldn t join in 
i thought it was terrible
to talk behind his back 
but one day   
he was transferred in
the middle of the term 
the teacher made us all
shake hands and say goodbye 
a feeling of disgust swept the room 
his hands were filthy 
walking around 
shaking hands with us 
he looked so nervous 
back at his own desk 
only i was left 
when i held out my hand he said 
 i ain t shaking hands with you  
 i ain t shaking hands with you  
i hated him the most 
he knew that 
that s why he didn t shake my hand 
what happened at the farmhouse 
ever since i was little   
i just pretend to be nice 
nothing s changed 
you re strange  today 
not the usual you 
i don t know what happened  but   
it s nothing to do with that 
i m sorry 
i just feel bad about what happened 
i think that boy was stupid 
maybe he didn t shake your hand
because he liked you 
no  he liked the class president 
he was always acting tough with me 
hands in pockets  spitting 
swearing  swaggering along 
   showing off 
exactly 
i know how he feels 
when i was little 
i used to bully the girl i liked 
that s not it 
he shook hands with everyone but me 
there s the problem 
girls never understand how boys feel 
as if you know   
let me guess  then   
he wasn t that tough 
he couldn t bully any boys 
he had no friends 
you sat next to him  an easy target 
he needed you to be tough with 
no way he wanted
to shake hands with everyone 
he could only prove how
tough he was with you 
don t be filthy 
i felt so guilty and so sorry for him
that i began copying him 
too late though  huh 
i couldn t take back
the pain i caused him 
it s stopped raining 
oh  yes 
the moon s out 
sometimes at night
you see raccoons here 
shall we go back 
they must be worried about me 
this ll be the talk of the town 
i m sorry  you ve been so kind 
i wonder what happened
at the house  though 
please  for my sake 
don t ask anyone 
shall i play that music 
i began to think of
my feelings for him 
and of his feelings for me 
for the very first time 
how come he seemed to sort out
my mixed up thoughts 
how come i let him get so close 
somehow he seemed older than me 
he was the one i wanted
to shake hands with 
just shake hands 
what was this feeling 
my mind raced as i sat beside him 
have you got everything 
yes  i m fine 
we ll see you in the winter 
i ll do my farming homework 
what about skiing 
that just takes practice 
consider what i said  taeko 
what s that 
what 
that s our secret 
something was strange yesterday 
sorry  next time i ll be fine 
i ll leave the ten year old me 
at home 
wait for me 
take care naoko 
goodbye 
some say love  it is a river
that drowns the tender reed 
some say love  it is a razor
that leaves your soul to bleed 
some say love  it is a hunger 
an endless aching need 
i say love  it is a flower 
and you its only seed 
it s the heart  afraid of breaking 
that never learns to dance 
it s the dream  afraid of waking 
that never takes a chance 
it s the one who won t be taken 
who cannot seem to give 
and the soul  afraid of dyin  
that never learns to live 
when the night has been too ionely
and the road has been too long 
and you think that love is only
for the lucky and the strong 
just remember in the winter
far beneath the bitter snows 
lies the seed 
that with the sun s love 
in the spring becomes the rose
