i won t be happy
until i ve brought the murderers
of artemus bradford to justice 
ah  and i won t be happy

at some garage sale 
   kitten slurping 
  i want that case  sir 
well  i ll tell you 
the problem is the bradford case
requires real police work 
  and the fact is  you re not
a real police inspector 
   kitten belches  
you are not a real policeman 
you are just a publicity stunt
that we have to put up with

great way to bring the company together
