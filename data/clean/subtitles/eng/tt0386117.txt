thanks 
  my shoes took me down a crooked path  
hey 
  hi 
i could use a story 
sure 
there were some buildings 
there are these really tall buildings 
and they could walk 
then there were some vampires 
and one of the vampires bit
the tallest building 
and his fangs broke off 
then all his other teeth fell out 
then he started crying 
and then all the other vampires   
   said   
 why are you crying 
 aren t those just your baby teeth  
and   
he said 
 no  those are my grown up teeth   
and   
   the vampires knew that
he couldn t be a vampire anymore 
so they left him 
the end 
and the sun is the center of
our solar system 
it s the reason that
all the planets are here 
it  uh  it s warmth gives the sunlight 
makes our planet livable 
and of course the sun won t
always be here to keep us warm 
it  uh  like all things will die 
and when it does 
first it expands 
enveloping all the surrounding planets 
including earth   
   before consuming rapidly 
the sun  after all  is just fuel 
burning ferociously 
when it runs out of fuel  well 
it ll be gone 
well  after that the   
   solar system will go dark 
permanently 
i m sure by that time  the   
   human race will have fallen to
any numbers of calamities 
war  pollution  global warming 
   tsunamies   
   earthquakes  meteors   
hey  who knows  right

bigger than all of you 
one time they attacked me
in my ice fortress 
they tried to cave in the roof 
but i made it too strong 
i told them to be still 
but they didn t 
i conquered them 
i had to make their heads explode 
and then they realized   
   that i knew
all the secrets of the world 
and then you know what happened 
they made me their king 
  a king 
  you were a king 
i knew there was something
special about him  i ve told you  guys

oh  come on  our heads are bigger 
you can t explode big heads 
no  their heads were
bigger than yours  believe me 
  but you re so small

my powers are able to slip
right through the cracks 
and what if the cracks are closed up 
then i ve a re cracker
which goes right through that 
but what if there s some sort of material
that re crackers can t get through 
then i ve a double re cracker   
   which can get through anything
in this whole universe 
and that s end and there s nothing
more powerful after that ever 
period

that s ira s 
i mean  the tree is yours
but the hole is ira s 
but everything else is yours 
except that rock over there 
that s not yours 
that little rock next to the big rock 
but everything else in the kingdom 
except for that stick   
   that little stick right there 
that s not yours 
i want you to be king forever  max 
yeah    definitely 
this part of your kingdom
is not so good 
why 
well  look  this used to be all rock 
and now it s sand   
   and then one day
it s gonna be dust 
and then the whole island
will be dust and   
then i don t even know
what comes after dust 
carol 
  hm hmm 
did you know the sun
was gonna die 
what 
i ve never heard that 
oh  come on   
   that can t happen 
you re the king 
and look at me    i m big 
how could guys like us worry about
a tiny little thing like the sun  hm 
carol  what s that 
  oh  it s that dog 
don t feed it 
it ll just follow you around 
carol  wait up for me 
  hideaway  
  well they ll seat us in the sun  
  by the way  
  know you ve always been the one  
did you make this 
yeah  yeah 
it s very good 
we were gonna make
a whole world like this  but   
everyone used to come here   
but now  
do you know what it feels like
when all your teeth are   
   falling out really slowly and   
   you don t realize and
then you notice that   
   well  they re really far apart 
and then one day   
   you don t have any teeth anymore 
  yeah 
  well  it was like that 
alright  put   
put your head right here 
right here 
alright  now watch 
i wish i could live in there 
yeah 
it s gonna be a place where only
the things you want to have happen   
   would happen 
yeah 
i guess it does not gonna happen 
i ll just   
   probably end up eating my feet off 
carol  we can totally
build a place like that 
  really 
  we re gonna start with the perfect fort 
and then we re gonna
build the city around it 
because  we gotta be realistic 
i mean   
we need to start
with the perfect fort   
   and then we re gonna
build the underground complex 
   that s gonna tie everything together 
i like your brain  max 
hey  i m not gonna
eat off my feet anymore 
  why 
  max is gonna build a fortress 
yeah  it s gonna be as tall as
twelve of you and six of me 
and only we can get in 
we can make an ice cream parlor 
a swimming pool with a bottom
that s a trampoline 
hey  where were you 
we    we were just here 
and anyone who gets in there 
that we don t want there   
   will get their brains cut out 
  the building will do it automatically 
  how does it know which brains to cut off 
okay  so there will be a tree 
   but it s a fake tree 
that s a tunnel 
so anyways  it s not a tree 
it s a tunnel 
and it will lead you into the fort
through a compartment 
ira  do you wanna be
in charge of the tunnels 
  because you can make great holes 
  wow  wow 
  i don t want my brains cut out 
  this fort is already making me happy 
does anybody ever hear me 
we ll take care for each other 
and we ll all sleep together in a real pile 
what do you think 
i don t think anything like this
ever works  really 
  but if it did   
  fine 
i don t know  i don t know 
i don t know anything 
but i do like sleeping in a real pile 
carol  will you be
in charge of building it 
you should definitely be in charge  carol 
  you re the only one who can pull it off 
  yeah  well  you re right but  uh   
kw  don t you think that
carol should build it 
yeah  he s the only one who can 
i ll build it if he doesn t want 
  wow    you really want to do this 
  yeah 
  i think it s a perfect idea 
  well   
alright  if you want to do it then   
you want me   
i would be honored 
  judy  you would have been good too 
  yeah 
we gotta put the doorway up here 
a little more that way

one more up there   
   and then we can have
the other mark over there 
yeah  a little more this way 
that s five  carol 
and then seven douglases across
we ll have the other mark 
  what you ve been eating 
  rocks

about eating rocks 
  that s six 
  you re getting a little paunch 
i know 
hey  kw 
  hey  king 
how about here 
it needs seven douglas s 
no more and no less 
  seven chubby douglases 
  hey  carol 
it s gonna be part castle  part fort 
part mountain  and part ship 
we ll have a laboratory 
   so we could build robots
to do stuff for us 
our own detective agency 
and    and our own language 
and we ll make a machine
that can take our legs off   
   and that way we can float 
alright  carol
