thanks
my shoes took me down a crooked path
hey
hi
i could use a story
sure
there were some buildings
there are these really tall buildings
and they could walk
then there were some vampires
and one of the vampires bit
the tallest building
and his fangs broke off
then all his other teeth fell out
then he started crying
and then all the other vampires
said
why are you crying
arent those just your baby teeth
and
he said
no those are my grown up teeth
and
the vampires knew that
he couldnt be a vampire anymore
so they left him
the end
and the sun is the center of
our solar system
its the reason that
all the planets are here
it uh its warmth gives the sunlight
makes our planet livable
and of course the sun wont
always be here to keep us warm
it uh like all things will die
and when it does
first it expands
enveloping all the surrounding planets
including earth
before consuming rapidly
the sun after all is just fuel
burning ferociously
when it runs out of fuel well
itll be gone
well after that the
solar system will go dark
permanently
im sure by that time the
human race will have fallen to
any numbers of calamities
war pollution global warming
tsunamies
earthquakes meteors

bigger than yours believe me

small is good
my powers are able to slip
right through the cracks

which can get through anything
in this whole universe
and thats end and theres nothing
more powerful after that ever

to be some material somewhere

carol wait up for me
hideaway
well theyll seat us in the sun
by the way

did you make this
yeah yeah
its very good
we were gonna make
a whole world like this but
everyone used to come here
but now
do you know what it feels like
when all your teeth are
falling out really slowly and
you dont realize and
then you notice that
well theyre really far apart
and then one day
you dont have any teeth anymore
yeah
well it was like that
alright put
put your head right here
right here
alright now watch
i wish i could live in there
yeah
its gonna be a place where only
the things you want to have happen
would happen
yeah
i guess it does not gonna happen
ill just
probably end up eating my feet off
carol we can totally
build a place like that
really
were gonna start with the perfect fort
and then were gonna
build the city around it
because we gotta be realistic
i mean
we need to start
with the perfect fort
and then were gonna
build the underground complex
thats gonna tie everything together
i like your brain max
hey im not gonna
eat off my feet anymore
why
max is gonna build a fortress
yeah its gonna be as tall as
twelve of you and six of me
and only we can get in
we can make an ice cream parlor
a swimming pool with a bottom
thats a trampoline
hey where were you
we we were just here
and anyone who gets in there
that we dont want there
will get their brains cut out
the building will do it automatically
how does it know which brains to cut off
okay so there will be a tree
but its a fake tree
thats a tunnel
so anyways its not a tree
its a tunnel
and it will lead you into the fort
through a compartment
ira do you wanna be
in charge of the tunnels
because you can make great holes
wow wow
i dont want my brains cut out
this fort is already making me happy
does anybody ever hear me
well take care for each other
and well all sleep together in a real pile
what do you think
i dont think anything like this
ever works really
but if it did
fine
i dont know i dont know
i dont know anything
but i do like sleeping in a real pile
carol will you be
in charge of building it
you should definitely be in charge carol
youre the only one who can pull it off
yeah well youre right but uh
kw dont you think that
carol should build it
yeah hes the only one who can
ill build it if he doesnt want
wow you really want to do this
