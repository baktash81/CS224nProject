by my soul cried gilbert
arent thou the devil in blue
to shoot in that way
nay posed robin laughing
not quite so ill as that i trust
then he took up another shaft
are you okay honey
then he took up another shaft
and fitted it to the string
again he shot
again he smoathed the arrow
close beside the center
the third time he losed his bowstring
and dropped the arrow
just betwix the other two
and into the very center
so that the feathers of all three
were ruffled together
seeming from a distance
to be one big shaft
and now a low murmur
ran all along the great crowd
hey champ how are you doing
feeling better
go away im tired
oh okay
sure thing buddy
you just get some rest okay
dont stop reading mom
280 score shafts were shot in all
and so deftly were they sped
that when the shooting was done
each target looked like the
back of a hedgehog
when a farm dog snuffed at it

of quick questions for you
