then he took up another shaft 
and fitted it to the string 
again he shot 
again  he smoathed the arrow
close beside the center 
the third time  he losed his bowstring
and dropped the arrow
just betwix the other two 
and into the very center 
so that the feathers of all three
were ruffled together
seeming from a distance
to be one big shaft 
and now a low murmur
ran all along the great crowd 
hey champ  how are you doing 
feeling better 
go away  i m tired 
oh  okay 
sure thing  buddy 
you just get some rest  okay 
don t stop reading  mom 
280 score shafts were shot in all
and so deftly were they sped 
that when the shooting was done
each target looked like the
back of a hedgehog   
when a farm dog snuffed at it
