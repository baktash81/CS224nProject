and you blew it like a pimp 
  didn t teach you to be no pimp 
  what s up  i blew money before 
  no class grifter would ve done it 
  think my play is bad 
i think you re the best 
i wouldn t be getting out otherwise 
what are you talking about 
i m too old for this racket  hang on
too long  you embarrass yourself 
we just took the biggest score
we ever had 
it s nothing compared to the big con 
you played the big con  you said it was
a dumb game for mama s boys and flakes 
hell  i never played no big con 
i hung around
and picked up a few things 
ain t no rich boy s gonna trust
a hungry nigger enough to be conned 
but i tell you  i been lookin 
for this one all my life  johnny 
now i have a chance
to step out when i m ahead 
come on 
what would you do with yourself 
i have a brother down in kc 
runs a freight outlet 
i can go halfsies with him 
it ain t too exciting 
but it s mostly legal 
i got an old friend in chicago 
name of henry gondorff

  he ll teach you all you gotta know 
  to hell with that 
  i wanna work with you  luther 
  i m out  johnny 
yeah  sure 
if that s the way you want it 
that s the way i want it 
how do you like that  huh 
after five years 
it was the only thing to do 
he was holding you back 
if it weren t for luther 
i d still be hustling pinball 
  i don t need more than what i got 
  you gotta lay off games of chance 
  there s a depression on 
  there s always a depression 
  you should save a little bit 
  i like grifting 
  buy some things 
  what 
  clothes  a car 
  i got clothes  i can t drive 
  what else have you got to sell 
  forget it 
hey  hooker  come here  you   
hi  snyder  what s the matter 
things a little slow at the bunco
department  somebody lose the dominoes 
you scored blood money today 
you need a friend

you got the wrong guy  pal 
i been home with the  flu all day 
  stake out my toilet if you want 
  keep talkin  
tell you what you did  smart boy 
you tied in to a loaded mark
on 47th across from maxie s 
you and coleman played the switch for
him and blew him off to a cab on 49th 
if he hadn t been a numbers runner
for doyle lonnegan  it d be perfect 
you re crazy 
i ain t stupid enough
to play for no rackets money 
not intentionally  maybe 
that don t cut no ice with lonnegan 
  he ll swat you like a fly 
  yeah  well   
i ll square it with the fixer 
nobody can buy you a prayer
if i put the finger on you 
i figure your end of the score
was at least three gs 
  i want two  no matter what it was 
  my take was only one 
you re gonna have to come up
with another grand somewhere 
all right 
you re a smart egg  hooker 
no sense gettin  dead over two grand 
relax  erie  i ll bill you 
  i thought you blew all your money

giving him counterfeit money 
hey  wait up  where are you going 
why  you

if snyder puts the finger on you 
  it s suicide 
  what difference does it make 
if snyder knows  so does everybody 
he never gets anything first

i already know how to drink 
sorry about luther  he was
the best street worker i ever saw 
he had you down as a big timer 
what happened 
i conned a senator from florida
on a stock deal 
a real lop ear  thought he was
gonna take over general electric 
some chantoozie woke him  though 
and he put the feds on me 
you mean you blew it 
luther didn t tell me
you had a big mouth 
he didn t tell me
you was a screw up either 
you played any big cons since then 
i lammed around a bunch of bohunk towns 
one kick ahead of the g men 
would be still if billie
hadn t set me up here 
don t kid yourself  friend 
i still know how 
gonna stay for breakfast
or do you already know how to eat 
i picked up somethin  on the way 
is lonnegan after you too 
i don t know 
i ain t seen anybody

doyle

we just talked to chicago  they got one
of the grifters last night  a nigger 
  how about the other one 
  they re still looking for him 
  who did combs put on it 
  riley and cole 
they staked out the guy s place
but he never showed 
they figure maybe he skipped town 
you wanna keep after him 
see that fellow in the red sweater 
his name s danny mccoy 
works protection rackets for carnello
while waiting for something better 
danny and i have known each other
since we were six 
take a good look at that face  floyd 
because if he ever finds out
i can be beat by one lousy grifter 
i ll kill him and every other hood
who wants to muscle in
on my chicago operation 
  you follow 
  yes  sir 
good lad 
feelin  all right

man of war started rattling yesterday
and threw a kid on its head 
great little countess  that billie

you plan to spend
the rest of your life here 
i could do a lot worse 
am i gonna learn
to play the big con or not 
  what s your hurry 
  i wanna play for lonnegan 
you know anything about the guy 
yeah  he croaked luther 
anything else i gotta know 
all right   
runs a numbers racket on the south side 
owns a packing house  banks   
and half the politicians
in new york and chicago 
not a fix in this world
is gonna cool him out 
  i ll get him anyway 
  why 
cos i don t know enough
about killing to kill him 
you can t do it alone  takes a mob of
guys and money to make  em look good 
  i know guys 
  it ain t like playin  winos   
i never played for no winos 
you gotta keep his con 
he can t know you took him 
you re scared of him 
right down to my socks  buster 
a guy who d kill a grifter over money
that wouldn t support him for two days 
you re gonna go for him 
i don t want a hot head
looking to get even 
saying it ain t enough 
cos it s all we re gonna get 
can you get a mob together 
after what happened to luther 
i can t get more than 200 300 guys 
luther said you learn fast 
i hope he s right 
lonnegan gets most income
from the numbers 
but puts money into
his savings and loans business 
  moving out of the rackets 
  no 
he owns most of the stock  it s traded 
he s building a respectable image 
he came out of five points but tells
everybody he was born in forest hills 
he knows the market  i don t think
we can take him on a stocks deal 
  what about the numbers 
  run out of a packing house on 14th 
by a guy named combs 
lonnegan comes every
three weeks or so to check on it 
but stays away from the day to day stuff
in case it s raided 
two of combs s favourite torpedoes 
riley and cole 
ever seen them 
  no 
  they re the ones who hit luther 
they also got the numbers runner
you conned  named mottola 
found him in a quarry
with a knife in his eye 
lonnegan s had seven
or eight people rubbed 
his pattern s been
to get close to a racket boss 
learn the operation and move in on it 
he s done it to gorman 
o donnell  buchalman 
took the numbers from sharkey 
all four of these guys are dead 
he s vindictive as hell  henry 
kills for pride 
doesn t add up he let hooker
get away from him 
you see anything  kid  you let us know 
if they put you on the spot 
we fold the con 
  you got that 
  yeah 
  sure it s gonna be one of these two 
  no 
they re just the only ones we know of 
ok 
time 
set me up five more beers

  you the owner here 
  that s right 
lieutenant snyder  bunco 
that s a joliet badge  snyder 
don t cut much up here 
lookin  for a guy on the lam 
he might be here 
i know everyone here
and i always bounce the lamsters 
all right if i look around 
no  but you re welcome to a free beer
before you go 
i don t really need your permission 
i don t know what to do with this guy

smoke or chase dames 
grand knight of columbus 
only goes out to play faro 
plays 15 or 20 hours at a time 
just him against the house 
  roulette  crap 
  won t touch them 
the croupier at gilman s says
he never plays unless he can win 
  sports 
  likes to be seen with fighters
but he doesn t go to fights
or bet on them 
jesus  does he do anything
when he s not alone 
just poker 
and he cheats 
pretty good at it  too 
  where does he play 
  runs a game on the century limited
when he comes here from new york

  who told you this guy was in here 
  nobody 
i know what kind of woman he likes 
i m gonna check all the joy houses 
maybe i could help you
if you tell me his name 
i doubt it  which way are the rooms 
right through there  but i wouldn t
