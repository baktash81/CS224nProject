  how does a bastard  orphan  
  son of a whore and a scotsman  
  dropped in the middle of
a forgotten spot in the caribbean  
  by providence
impoverished  in squalor  
  grow up to be a hero and a scholar   
  the ten dollar founding father
without a father  
  got a lot farther  
  by working a lot harder  
  by being a lot smarter  
  by being a self starter  
  by 14  they placed him
in charge of a trading charter  
  and every day  while slaves
were being slaughtered  
  and carted away across the waves  
  he struggled and kept his guard up  
  inside  he was longing
for something to be a part of  
  the brother was ready to beg
steal  borrow or barter  
  then a hurricane came
and devastation reigned  
  our man saw his future
drip dripping down the drain  
  put a pencil to his temple
connected it to his brain  
  and he wrote his first refrain
a testament to his pain  
  well  the word got around
they said   this kid is insane  man   
  took up a collection
just to send him to the mainland  
  get your education
don t forget from whence you came  
  and the world s gonna know your name  
  what s your name  man   
  alexander hamilton

  when he was ten his father split
full of it  debt ridden  
  two years later
see alex and his mother bedridden  
  half dead  sittin  in their own sick  
  the scent thick and     
 company    alex got better
but his mother went quick  
  moved in with a cousin
the cousin committed suicide  
  left him with nothing but ruined pride
something new inside  
  a voice saying  
 with company 
   alex  you gotta fend for yourself   
 solo    he started retreatin  and readin 
every treatise on the shelf  
  there would ve been nothing left to do
for someone less astute  
  he would ve been dead or destitute
without a cent of restitution  
  started working
clerking for his late mother s landlord  
  tradin  sugarcane and rum
and all the things he can t afford  
  company    scammin   
   scammin  for every book  
  he can get his hands on  
  company    plannin   
   plannin  for the future  
  see him now as he stands on
the bow of a ship  
  headed for a new land

into a flame  
  but damn  it s getting dark
so let me spell out the name

   a l e x a n d e r  
  we are meant to be  
  a colony that runs independently  
  meanwhile  britain
keeps shittin  on us endlessly  
  essentially  they tax us relentlessly  
  then king george turns around
runs a spending spree  
  he ain t ever gonna
set his descendants free  
  so there will be a revolution
in this century  
   enter me  
   he says in parentheses  
  and don t be shocked
when your history book mentions me  
  i will lay down my life
if it sets us free  
  eventually you ll see my ascendancy

  until those in bondage

  geniuses  lower your voices

they surround our troops  
  as a kid in the caribbean
i wished for a war  
  i knew that i was poor
i knew it was the only way to rise up  
  if they tell my story  
  i am either gonna die
on the battlefield in glory  
   or rise up  
   rise up  
  we will fight for this land
but there s only one man  
  who can give us a command  
   so we can rise up  
   rise up  
  understand  it s the only way to rise up
rise up  
   here he comes  
   here comes the general  
   ladies and gentlemen  
   here comes the general   
   the moment you ve been waiting for

of a modern major general  
  the venerated virginian veteran  
  whose men are all lining up
to put me up on a pedestal  
  writing letters to relatives
embellishing my elegance and eloquence  
  but the elephant is in the room
the truth is in your face  
  when you hear
the british cannons go     
boom 
  any hope of success is fleeting  
  how can i keep leading when the people
i m leading keep retreating   
  we put a stop to the bleeding

i remember that    
  i remember that night  
  i just might regret that night
for the rest of my days  
  i remember those soldier boys tripping
over themselves to win our praise  
  i remember that dreamlike candlelight
like a dream that you can t quite place  
  but  alexander  i ll never forget
the first time i saw your face  
  i have never been the same  
  intelligent eyes
in a hunger pang frame  
  and when you said hi
i forgot my dang name  
  set my heart aflame  every part aflame
this is not a game  
  you strike me as a woman
who has never been satisfied  
  i m sure i don t know what you mean
you forget yourself  
  you re like me
i m never satisfied  
  is that right   
   i have never been satisfied  
  partygoers gasp 
  my name is angelica schuyler  
  alexander hamilton  
  where s your family from   
  unimportant
there s a million things i haven t done  
  but just you wait  just you wait     
  so  so  so  so this is
what it feels like to match wits  
  with someone at your level
what the hell is the catch   
  it s the feeling of freedom
of seeing the light  
  it s ben franklin with a key and a kite
you see it  right   
  the conversation lasted two minutes
maybe three minutes  
  everything we said in total agreement  
  it s a dream and it s a bit of a dance  
  a bit of a posture
it s a bit of a stance  
  he s a bit of a flirt
but i mma give it a chance  
  i asked about his family
did you see his answer   
  his hands started fidgeting
he looked askance  
  he s penniless
he s flying by the seat of his pants  
  handsome  boy  does he know it  
  peach fuzz  and he can t even grow it  
  i wanna take him
far away from this place  
  then i turn and see my sister s face
and she is     
  helpless  
  and i know she is     
  helpless  
  and her eyes are just     
  helpless  
  and i realize three fundamental truths
at the exact same time  
 where are you taking me 
 i m about to change your life 
then by all means  lead the way 
 company    number one  
  i m a girl in a world in which
my only job is to marry rich  
  my father has no sons  so i m the one
who has to social climb for one  
   cause i m the oldest and the wittiest  
  and the gossip in new york city
is insidious  
  and alexander is penniless  
  ha  that doesn t mean
i want him any less  
elizabeth schuyler 
it s a pleasure to meet you 
 schuyler 
 my sister 
 company    number two  
  he s after me
 cause i m a schuyler sister  
  that elevates his status  
  i d have to be naive to set that aside
maybe that is why  
  i introduced him to eliza
now that s his bride  
  nice going  angelica  he was right
you will never be satisfied  
thank you for all your service 
if it takes fighting a war for us to meet 
it will have been worth it 
i ll leave you to it 
 company    number three  
  i know my sister
like i know my own mind  
  you will never find
anyone as trusting or as kind  
  if i tell her that i love him
she d be silently resigned  
  he d be mine
she would say   i m fine   
   she d be lying  
   she d be lying  
  but when i fantasize at night
it s alexander s eyes  
  as i romanticize what might have been  
  if i hadn t sized him up so quickly  
  at least my dear eliza s his wife  
  at least i keep his eyes in my life  
   to the groom  
   to the groom  to the groom  
  to the groom  
   to the bride  
   to the bride  to the bride

   by your side  
   to your union  
   to the union  to the revolution  
   and the hope that you provide  
   you provide  you provide  
   may you always     
   always  
   be satisfied  
   be satisfied  
  satisfied  satisfied  
   and i know     
   be satisfied  
  be satisfied  be satisfied  
   she ll be happy as his bride  
   be satisfied  be satisfied

  he will never be satisfied

  charles lee was left behind
without a pot to piss in  
  he started saying this
to anybody who would listen  
 lee    washington cannot be left alone
to his devices  
  indecisive  from crisis to crisis  
  the best thing he could do
for the revolution  
  is turn and go back to planting tobacco
in mount vernon  
  ooh  
  don t do a thing
history will prove him wrong  
   but  sir    
   we have a war to fight

we both know that s absurd  sir

this war is hard enough

lee called you out 
 we called his bluff 
 you solve nothing 
you aggravate our allies to the south 
you re absolutely right 
john should have shot him in the mouth 
that would ve shut him up 
 son  
 i m not your son  
  watch your tone  
  i am not a maiden in need of defending  
   i am grown   
   charles lee  thomas conway  
  these men take your name
and they rake it through the mud  
  my name s been through a lot
i can take it  
  well  i don t have your name  
  i don t have your titles
i don t have your land  
   but if you    
   no  
  if you gave me command of a battalion
a group of men to lead  
  i could fly above my station
after the war  
or you could die  and we need you alive 
i am more than willing to die 
your wife needs you alive  son 
i need you alive 
call me son one more time 
go home  alexander 
that s an order from your commander 
sir

  look around  look around  
  at how lucky we are
to be alive right now  
  look around  look around  
  how long have you known   
   a month or so  
   eliza  
  you should have told me  
  i wrote to the general a month ago  
   no  
   i begged him to send you home  
  you should have told me  
  i m not sorry  
  i knew you d fight
until the war was won  
  the war s not done  
  but you deserve a chance
to meet your son  
  look around  look around  
  at how lucky we are
to be alive right now  
  will you relish
being a poor man s wife   
  unable to provide for your life  
  i relish being your wife  
  look around  look around  
  look at where you are  
  look at where you started  
  the fact that you re alive
is a miracle  
  just stay alive
that would be enough  
  and if this child  
  shares a fraction of your smile  
  or a fragment of your mind  
  look out  world  
  that would be enough  
  i don t pretend to know  
  the challenges you re facing  
  the worlds you keep erasing  
  and creating in your mind  
  but i m not afraid  
  i know who i married  
  so long as you come home
at the end of the day  
  that would be enough  
  we don t need a legacy  
  we don t need money  
  if i could grant you peace of mind  
  if you could let me inside your heart  
  oh  let me be a part of the narrative  
  in the story they will write someday  
  let this moment be the first chapter  
  where you decide to stay  
  and i could be enough  
  and we could be enough  
  that would be enough  
 audience cheering  applauding

on my feet  the enemy ahead of me  
  if this is the end of me
at least i have a friend with me  
  weapon in my hand
a command  and my men with me  
  then i remember

   we move undercover  
  and we move as one  
  through the night
we have one shot to live another day  
  we cannot let a stray gunshot
give us away  
  we will fight up close
seize the moment and stay in it

or meet the business end of a bayonet  
  the code word is  rochambeau   
   dig me   
   rochambeau

redefining bravery  
  we ll never be free
until we end slavery  
  when we finally drive the british away  
  lafayette is there waiting

  this colony s economy s
increasingly stalling  
  and honestly  that s why public service
seems to be calling me  
  he s just nonstop  
  i practiced the law
i practically perfected it  
  i ve seen injustice in the world
and i ve corrected it  
  now for a strong central democracy

 burr  you re a better lawyer than me

 the new us constitution 
 no   chuckles 
 hear me out 
no way 
  a series of essays
anonymously published  
  defending the document to the public  
 no one ll read it 
 i disagree 
 and if it fails 
 burr  that s why we need it 
 the constitution s a mess 
 so it needs amendments 
 it s full of contradictions 
 so is independence 
 we have to start somewhere 
 no  no way 
 you re making a mistake 
 good night 
hey  what are you waiting for 
what do you stall for 
 what 
 we won the war  what was it all for 
 do you support this constitution 
 of course 
 then defend it 
 what if you re backing the wrong horse 
  burr  we studied
and we fought and we killed  
  for the notion of a nation
we now get to build  
  for once in your life
take a stand with pride  
  i don t understand
how you stand to the side  
  i will keep all my plans
close to my chest  
  wait for it  wait for it  wait     
  i ll wait here
and see which way the wind will blow  
  i m taking my time  
  watching the afterbirth of a nation  
  watching the tension grow  
  i am sailing off to london  
  i m accompanied
by someone who always pays  
  i have found a wealthy husband  
  who will keep me in comfort
for all my days  
  he is not a lot of fun  
  but there s no one
who can match you for turn of phrase  
   my alexander  
   angelica  
  don t forget to write  
  look at where you are  
  look at where you started  
  the fact that you re alive
is a miracle  
  just stay alive
that would be enough  
  and if your wife could share
a fraction of your time  
  if i could grant you peace of mind  
  would that be enough

enterprising men quote  em  
  don t act surprised  you guys
 cause i wrote  em  
  ow  but hamilton forgets  
  his plan would have the government
assume states  debts  
  now  place your bets
as to who that benefits  
  the very seat of government
where hamilton sits  
   not true   
   ooh  if the shoe fits  wear it  
  if new york s in debt
why should virginia bear it   
  uh  our debts are paid  i m afraid  
  don t tax the south
 cause we got it made in the shade  
  in virginia we plant seeds in the ground
we create  
  you just wanna move our money around  
  this financial plan
is an outrageous demand  
  and it s too many damn pages
for any man to understand  
  stand with me in the land of the free  
  pray to god we never see
hamilton s candidacy  
  look  when britain taxed our tea
we got frisky  
  imagine what gon  happen
when you try to tax our whiskey  
 washington  thank you 
secretary jefferson   chuckles  oh 
 audience laughing  cheering 
 secretary hamilton  your response 
  female cabinet member  all right now 
  thomas  that was
a real nice declaration  
  welcome to the present
we re running a real nation  
  would you like to join us
or stay mellow  
  doin  whatever the hell it is
you do in monticello   
  if we assume the debts
the union gets  
  a new line of credit
a financial diuretic  
  how do you not get it   
  if we re aggressive and competitive
the union gets a boost  
  you d rather give it a sedative   
  a civics lesson from a slaver  
  hey  neighbor  your debts are paid
 cause you don t pay for labor  
   we plant seeds in the south
we create   
  yeah  keep ranting
we know who s really doing the planting  
 cabinet members murmuring 
  and another thing
mr  age of enlightenment  
  don t lecture me about the war
you didn t fight in it  
  you think i m frightened of you  man 
we almost died in a trench  
  while you were off getting high
with the french  
  thomas jefferson
always hesitant with the president  
 coughing 
  reticent
there isn t a plan he hasn t jettisoned  
  madison  you mad as a hatter  son
take your medicine  
  damn  you re in worse shape
than the national debt is in  
  sittin  there useless as two shits  
  hey  turn around  bend over
i ll show you where my shoe fits  
  cabinet members shouting  gasping 
  washington  excuse me 
madison  jefferson  take a walk 
hamilton  take a walk 
 chuckles 
we re gonna reconvene
after a brief recess   chuckles 
 hamilton 
 sir 
a word 
  you don t have the votes  
 madison  jefferson 
  you don t have the votes  
 laughs 
  you re gonna need congressional approval
and you don t have the votes  
  such a blunder  
  sometimes it makes me wonder
why i even bring the thunder  
  why he even brings the thunder  
 audience cheering  applauding 
you wanna pull yourself together 
i m sorry 
these virginians are birds of a feather 
young man  i m from virginia 
so  watch your mouth 
so we let congress
get held hostage by the south 
 you need the votes 
 no  we need bold strokes 
 we need this plan 
 no  you need to convince more folks 
well  james madison won t talk to me 
that s a nonstarter 
ah  winning was easy  young man 
governing s harder 
 they re being intransigent 
 you have to find a compromise 
they don t have a plan 
they just hate mine 
convince them otherwise 
and what happens
if i don t get congressional approval 
i imagine they ll call for your removal 
 sir 
 figure it out  alexander 
that s an order from your commander

 hamilton    i hadn t slept in a week
i was weak  i was awake  
  you ve never seen a bastard orphan
more in need of a break  
  longing for angelica  missing my wife  
  that s when miss maria reynolds
walked into my life  
  she said   
  i know you are a man of honor  
  i m so sorry to bother you at home  
  but i don t know where to go  
  and i came here all alone  
  she said   
  my husband s doin  me wrong  
  beatin  me  cheatin  me  
  mistreatin  me  
  suddenly he s up and gone  
  i don t have the means to go on  
  so i offered her a loan
i offered to walk her home  
  she said   
  you re too kind  sir  
  i gave her 30 bucks
that i had socked away  
  she lived a block away
she said   
  this one s mine  sir  
  then i said
 well  i should head back home   
  she turned red  she led me to her bed
let her legs spread and said   
  stay   
  hey

  that s when i began to pray  
  lord  show me how to say no to this

   we ought to give it a try  
  chuckles

   talk less  
  audience laughs

  to get my plan on the congress floor  
 burr    now madison and jefferson

 hamilton

 hamilton 
   i m sorry  burr  i gotta go  
oh  but  uh  
  decisions are happening over dinner  
  two virginians and an immigrant
walk into a room  
 with company 
  diametrically opposed  foes  
  they emerge with a compromise  
  having opened doors that were  
  with company    previously closed  
  company    bros  
  the immigrant emerges
with unprecedented financial power  
  a system he can shape however he wants  
  the virginians emerge
with the nation s capital  
  and here s the pièce de résistance  
  no one else was in the room
where it happened  
  the room where it happened
the room where it happened  
  no one else was in the room
where it happened  
  the room where it happened
the room where it happened  
  no one really knows
how the game is played  
  the art of the trade
how the sausage gets made  
  we just assume that it happens  
  but no one else is in the room
where it happens  
 company    thomas claims   
  alexander was on washington s doorstep
one day  in distress and disarray  
 company    thomas claims   
   alexander said   
   i have nowhere else to turn  
  and basically begged me
to join the fray  
 company    thomas claims   
  i approached madison and said   
   i know you hate him
but let s hear what he has to say   
 company    thomas claims   
  well  i arranged the meeting  
  i arranged the menu
the venue  the seating  
 burr    but no one else was in the room
where it happened  
  the room where it happened
the room where it happened  
  no one else was in the room
where it happened  
  the room where it happened
the room where it happened  
  no one really knows
how the parties get to yes  
  the pieces that are sacrificed
in every game of chess  
  we just assume that it happens  
  but no one else is in the room
where it happens  
  company    meanwhile  
   meanwhile madison is grappling  
  with the fact that not every issue
can be settled by committee  
   meanwhile  
   congress is fighting  
  over where to put the capital  
  overlapping screams 
 it isn t pretty 
  then jefferson approaches
with a dinner and invite  
  and madison responds
with virginian insight  
  maybe we can solve one problem
with another  
  and win a victory for the southerners  
   in other words  
   oh  ho  
   a quid pro quo  
   i suppose  
  wouldn t you like to work
a little closer to home   
  actually  i would  
   well  i propose the potomac  
   and you ll provide him his votes   
   well  we ll see how it goes  
   let s go  
  burr    no     
  company       one else was in  
  the room where it happened  
  the room where it happened
the room where it happened  
  no one else was in the room
where it happened  
  the room where it happened
the room where it happened  
  burr    my god   
  burr with company    in god we trust  
  but we ll never really know

  and no one else is in the room
where it happened  
 company    alexander hamilton  
 solo    what did they say to you  
  to get you to sell new york city
down the river   
 company    alexander hamilton  
 solo    did washington
know about the dinner  
  was there presidential pressure
to deliver   
 company    alexander hamilton  
 burr    or did you know even then  
  it doesn t matter
where you put the us capital   
   cause we ll have the banks
we re in the same spot  
   you got more than you gave  
   and i wanted what i got  
  when you got skin in the game
you stay in the game  
  but you don t get a win
unless you play in the game  
  oh  you get love for it
you get hate for it  
  you get nothing if you  
 with company 
  wait for it  wait for it  wait  
  god help and forgive me

 company 
  we want our leaders to save the day  
  but we don t get a say
in what they trade away

 audience cheering  applauding 
look  grandpa s in the paper

  grandpa just lost his seat
in the senate  
  sometimes that s how it goes  
  well  daddy s gonna find out
any minute  
  i m sure he already knows  
  further down  
 together    further down  
 philip     let s meet the newest senator
from new york   
 eliza    new york  
 eliza  philip    our senator  
  burr  since when are you
a democratic republican   
  since being one put me
on the up and up again  
  no one knows who you are
or what you do  
  hey  they don t need to know me
they don t like you  
   excuse me   
   oh  wall street thinks you re great  
  you ll always be adored
by the things you create  
   but upstate  
   wait  
  people think you re crooked  
  and schuyler s seat was up for grabs
so i took it  
  i ve always considered you a friend  
  i don t see why that has to end  
  you changed parties
to run against my father in law  
  i changed parties
to seize the opportunity i saw  
  i swear  your pride
will be the death of us all  
  beware  it goeth before the fall  
the issue on the table 
france is on the verge of war
with england 
now  do we commit money and aid to our
french allies  or do we stay out of it 
remember  my decision on this matter
is not subject to congressional approval 
the only one you have to convince is me 
secretary jefferson 
you have the floor  sir 
  when we were on death s door
when we were needy  
  we made a promise
we signed a treaty  
  we needed money and guns
and half a chance  
  uh  who provided those funds   
france 
  in return  they didn t ask for land  
  only a promise that we d lend a hand  
  and stand with them
if they fought against oppressors  
  and revolution is messy  
   but now is the time to stand  
  cabinet members cheer 
  stand with our brothers
as they fight against tyranny  
 cabinet members  uh huh 
  i know that alexander hamilton is here  
  and he would rather not
have this debate  
  i ll remind you
that he is not secretary of state  
  cabinet members  oh 
   he knows nothing of loyalty  
  smells like new money
dresses like fake royalty  
  desperate to rise above his station  
  everything he does betrays
the ideals of our nation  
 cabinet members murmuring 
  ay  and if you don t know
now you know  mr  president  
thank you  secretary jefferson 
secretary hamilton  your response 
 cabinet member  get him  boy 
 cabinet member 2  let him know right now 
  you must be outta your goddamn mind
if you think  
  the president is gonna
bring the nation to the brink  
  of meddling in the middle
of a military mess  
  a game of chess
where france is queen and king less  
  we signed a treaty with a king
whose head is now in a basket  
  would you like to take it out
and ask it   
   oh  should we honor our treaty
king louis s head    
   ah  do whatever you want
i m super dead   
  cabinet members murmur 
  washington    enough  enough  
   hamilton is right  
 mr  president  
  we re too fragile
to start another fight  
  sir  do we not fight for freedom   
  sure  when the french figure out
who s gonna lead  em  
  the people are leading  
  the people are rioting
there s a difference  
  frankly  it s a little disquieting  
  you would let your ideals
blind you to reality  
   hamilton   
   sir  
   draft a statement of neutrality  
   yes  sir  
  did you forget lafayette   
 what 
   have you an ounce of regret   
  you accumulate debt
you accumulate power  
  yet in their hour of need you forget  
  lafayette s a smart man
he ll be fine  
  and before he was your friend
he was mine  
  if we try to fight
in every revolution in the world  
  we never stop
where do we draw the line   
   so quick witted  
   alas  i admit it  
   i bet you were quite a lawyer  
   my defendants got acquitted  
yeah 
   well  someone ought to remind you  
   what   
  you re nothing
without washington behind you  
  washington  hamilton 
 daddy s calling 
  it must be nice  
  it must be nice  
  to have washington on your side  
  jefferson chuckles  scoffs 
   it must be nice  
  it must be nice  
  to have washington on your side  
  every action
has its equal opposite reaction  
  thanks to hamilton
our cabinet s fractured into factions  
  try not to crack under the stress
we re breaking down like fractions  
  we smack each other in the press
and we don t print retractions  
  i get no satisfaction
witnessing his fits of passion  
  the way he primps and preens
and dresses like the pits of fashion  
  our poorest citizens  our farmers
live ration to ration  
  as wall street robs  em blind
in search of chips to cash in  
  this prick is asking
for someone to bring him to task  
  somebody give me some dirt
on this vacuous mass  
  so we can at last unmask him  
  i ll pull the trigger on him  
  someone load the gun and cock it  
  while we were all watching
he got washington in his pocket  
 burr  jefferson    it must be nice  
  it must be nice  
  to have washington on your side  
  it must be nice  
  it must be nice  
  to have washington on your side

  to have washington on your side

  centralizing national credit
and making american credit competitive  
  if we don t stop it

  i have to resign  
  somebody has to stand up for the south  
  or somebody has to
stand up to his mouth  
  if there s a fire
you re trying to douse  
  you can t put it out
from inside the house  
  i m in the cabinet  i am complicit  
  in watching him grabbin  at power
and kiss it  
  if washington isn t gon  listen
to disciplined dissidents  
  this is the difference
this kid is out  
  oh  this immigrant
isn t somebody we chose  
  oh  this immigrant s
keeping us all on our toes  
  oh  let s show these federalists
who they re up against  
  oh  southern mother    
democratic republicans  
  oh  now follow the money
and see where it goes  
  oh  
  because every second
the treasury grows  
  oh  
  if we follow the money
and see where it leads  
  get in the weeds  look for the seeds
of hamilton s misdeeds  
  it must be nice  it must be nice  
  we follow the money
and see where it goes  
  it must be nice  it must be nice  
  the emperor has no clothes

  sir  with britain and france
on the verge of war  
  is this the best time    
  i want to warn
against partisan fighting  
  pick up a pen  start writing  
  i wanna talk about what i have learned  
  the hard won wisdom i have earned  
  as far as the people are concerned  
  you have to serve
you could continue to serve  
  no  one last time  
  the people will hear from me
one last time  
  and if we get this right  
  we re gonna teach  em
how to say goodbye  
  you and i  
  mr  president
they will say you re weak  
  no  they will see we re strong  
  your position is so unique  
  so i ll use it to move them along  
  why do you have to say goodbye   
  if i say goodbye  
  the nation learns to move on  
  it outlives me when i m gone  
  like the scripture says  
   everyone shall sit
under their own vine and fig tree  
  and no one shall make them afraid   
  they ll be safe in the nation
we ve made  
  i want to sit under my own vine
and fig tree  
  a moment alone in the shade  
  at home in this nation we ve made  
  one last time  
  one last time   
though  in reviewing the incidents
of my administration 
i am unconscious of intentional error 
i am nevertheless too sensible
of my defects
not to think it probable
that i may have committed many errors 
i shall also carry with me the hope
that my country will view them
with indulgence   
 together  and that after 45 years
of my life dedicated to its service 
with an upright zeal 
the faults of incompetent abilities
will be consigned to oblivion 
as i myself must soon be
to the mansions of rest 
i anticipate with pleasing expectation
that retreat   
  in which i promise myself to realize  
 both continue 
  the sweet enjoyment of partaking  
  in the midst of my fellow citizens  
  the benign influence of good laws
under a free government  
  the ever favorite object of my heart  
  and the happy reward as i trust  
  of our mutual cares  
  labors  
  and dangers  
  one last time

  adams fires hamilton

  hamilton publishes his response  
  sit down  john  you fat mother bleep    
 burr  hamilton s out of control 
this is great  he s out of power 
he holds no office 
and he just destroyed
president john adams 
the only other significant member
of his party 
hamilton is a host unto himself 
as long as he can hold a pen 
he s a threat 
let s let him know what we know 
mr  vice president 
 mr  madison 
  audience chuckling 
senator burr 
what is this 
  we have the check stubs
from separate accounts  
  almost a thousand dollars
paid in different amounts  
  to a mr  james reynolds
way back in 1791  
  is that what you have 
are you done   
  you are uniquely situated
by virtue of your position    
  though  virtue  is not a word
i d apply to this situation  
  to seek financial gain
to stray from your sacred mission  
  and the evidence suggests
you ve engaged in speculation  
  an immigrant embezzling
our government funds  
  i can almost see the headline
your career is done  
  i hope you saved some money
for your daughter and sons  
  you best g wan run back
where you come from  
  ha  you don t even know
what you re asking me to confess  
  confess  
  you have nothing
i don t have to tell you anything at all  
   unless     
   unless     
  if i can prove
that i never broke the law  
  do you promise not to tell
another soul what you saw   
  no one else was in the room
where it happened  
is that a yes 
 all  um  yes 
 audience chuckles 
   dear sir  i hope this letter
finds you in good health  
  and in a prosperous enough
position to put wealth  
  in the pockets of people like me
down on their luck  
  you see  that was my wife
who you decided to     
 what 
  audience laughs 
  she courted me  escorted me to bed  
  and when she had me in a corner
that s when reynolds extorted me  
  for a sordid fee  i paid him quarterly  
  i may have mortally wounded my prospects
but my papers are orderly  
  as you can see  i kept a record
of every check in my checkered history  
  check it again against your list
and see consistency  
  i never spent a cent that wasn t mine  
  you sent the dogs after my scent
that s fine  
  yes  i have reasons for shame  
  but i have not committed treason
and sullied my good name  
  as you can see  i have done nothing
to provoke legal action  
  are my answers to your satisfaction   
 my god 
  audience laughing 
gentlemen  let s go 
so 
 madison  jefferson 
  the people won t know what we know  
 hamilton  burr 
  how do i know
you won t use this against me  
  the next time we go toe to toe   
  alexander  rumors only grow  
  and we both know what we know  
 echoes    know  know  
  in the eye of a hurricane
there is quiet  
  for just a moment  
  a yellow sky  
  when i was 17
a hurricane destroyed my town  
  i didn t drown  
  i couldn t seem to die  
  i wrote my way out  
  wrote everything down
far as i could see  
  i wrote my way out  
  i looked up
and the town had its eyes on me  
  they passed a plate around  
  and total strangers  
  moved to kindness  
  by my story  
  raised enough for me to book passage
on a ship that was new york bound  
  i wrote my way out of hell
i wrote my way to revolution  
  i was louder
than the crack in the bell  
  i wrote eliza love letters
until she fell  
  i wrote about the constitution
and defended it well  
  and in the face
of ignorance and resistance  
  i wrote financial systems
into existence  
  and when my prayers to god
were met with indifference  
  i picked up a pen
i wrote my own deliverance  
  in the eye of a hurricane
there is quiet  
  for just a moment  
  a yellow sky  
  i was 12 when my mother died
she was holding me  
  we were sick and she was holding me  
  i couldn t seem to die  
 female company 
  wait for it  wait for it  wait for it  
   i ll write my way out  
   wait for it  wait for it  wait for it  
  write everything down far as i can see  
  wait for it  wait for it
wait for it  wait for it  
  i ll write my way out  
  overwhelm them with honesty  
  this is the eye of the hurricane  
  this is the only way
i can protect my legacy

wait

  and he wrote it down right there  
highlights 
   the charge against me is a connection

  i knew you were mine  
  you said you were mine  
  i thought you were mine  
  do you know what angelica said  
  when we saw your first letter arrive   
  she said
 be careful with that one  love  
  he will do what it takes to survive   
  you and your words flooded my senses  
  your sentences left me defenseless  
  you built me palaces out of paragraphs  
  you built cathedrals  
  i m rereading the letters you wrote me  
  i m searching and scanning for answers  
  in every line for some kind of sign  
  and when you were mine  
  the world seemed  
  to burn  
  burn  
  you published the letters
she wrote you  
  you told the whole world
how you brought this girl into our bed  
  in clearing your name  
  you have ruined our lives  
  do you know what angelica said  
  when she read what you d done   
  she said   you ve married an icarus  
  he s flown too close to the sun   
  you and your words
obsessed with your legacy  
  your sentences border on senseless  
  and you are paranoid
in every paragraph  
  how they perceive you  
  you  you  you  
  i m erasing myself from the narrative  
  let future historians wonder
how eliza reacted  
  when you broke her heart  
  you have torn it all apart  
  i m watching it burn  
  watching it burn  
  the world has no right to my heart  
  the world has no place in our bed  
  they don t get to know what i said  
  i m burning the memories  
  burning the letters
that might have redeemed you  
  you forfeit all rights to my heart  
  you forfeit the place in our bed  
  you ll sleep in your office instead  
  with only the memories  
  of when you were mine  
 sighs 
  i hope that you  
  burn

  but i toe the line  
  as i reckon with the effects  
  of your life on mine  
  i look back on where i failed

face to face  
  i have the honor to be  
  your obedient servant

  no one knows what you believe  
  i will not equivocate on my opinion  
  i have always worn it on my sleeve

a more specific grievance  
  here s an itemized list
of 30 years of disagreements  
 burr  sweet jesus

hey 
  best of wives and best of women  
 company    one  two  three  four
five  six  seven  eight  nine  
 burr    there are ten things
you need to know  
 company    number one  
 burr    we rode across the hudson
at dawn  
  my friend  william p  van ness
signed on  
   as my number two  
  company    number two  
 burr    hamilton arrived with his crew  
  nathaniel pendleton
and a doctor that he knew  
 company    number three  
 burr    i watched hamilton
examine the terrain  
  i wish i could tell you
what was happening in his brain  
  this man has poisoned
my political pursuits  
 company 
  most disputes die  and no one shoots  
  number four  
 burr    hamilton drew first position  
  looking  to the world
like a man on a mission  
  this is a soldier
with a marksman s ability  
  the doctor turned around
so he could have deniability  
 company    five  
  now  i didn t know this at the time
but we were  
   near the same spot your son died  
   near the same spot my son died  
   is that why  
  company    six  
 burr    he examined his gun
with such rigor   
  i watched as he methodically
fiddled with the trigger  
 company    seven  
 burr    confession time
here s what i got  
  my fellow soldiers ll tell you
i m a terrible shot  
 company    number eight  
 burr  hamilton 
  your last chance to negotiate  
  send in your seconds  
  see if they can
set the record straight  
 burr    they won t teach you this
in your classes  
  but look it up
hamilton was wearing his glasses  
  why  if not to take deadly aim   
  it s him or me
the world will never be the same  
  i had only one thought
before the slaughter  
  this man will not make
an orphan of my daughter  
 company    number nine  
 burr    look him in the eyes
aim no higher  
  summon all the courage you require  
  then count  
 company    one  two  three  four
five  six  seven  eight  nine  
  number ten paces  fire   
 gunshot 
 hamilton    i imagine death so much
it feels more like a memory  
  is this where it gets me  
  on my feet  several feet ahead of me   
  i see it coming  
  do i run or fire my gun or let it be   
  there is no beat  no melody  
  burr  my first friend  my enemy  
  maybe the last face i ever see  
  if i throw away my shot  
  is this how you remember me   
  what if this bullet is my legacy   
  legacy  
  what is a legacy   
  it s planting seeds in a garden
you never get to see  
  i wrote some notes  
  at the beginning of a song
someone will sing for me  
  america  you great unfinished symphony  
  you sent for me
you let me make a difference  
  a place where even orphan immigrants
can leave their fingerprints and rise up  
  i m running out of time
i m running and my time s up  
  wise up  eyes up  
  i catch a glimpse of the other side  
  laurens leads a soldiers  chorus
on the other side  
  my son is on the other side  
  he s with my mother on the other side  
  washington is watching
from the other side  
  teach me how to say goodbye  
rise up  rise up  rise up 
  eliza   
my love  take your time 
 breathes shakily 
i ll see you on the other side 
  raise a glass to freedom  
 company  he aims his pistol at the sky 
 wait 
  gunshot 
  i strike him right between his ribs  
  i walk towards him
but i am ushered away  
  they row him back across the hudson  
  i get a drink  
 company vocalizing 
  i hear wailing in the streets  
 vocalizing 
  somebody tells me   you d better hide   
 vocalizing 
  they say angelica and eliza  
  were both at his side when he died  
  death doesn t discriminate
between the sinners and the saints  
  it takes and it takes and it takes  
  history obliterates
in every picture it paints  
  it paints me in all my mistakes  
  when alexander aimed at the sky  
  he may have been the first one to die  
  but i m the one who paid for it  
  i survived  but i paid for it  
  now i m the villain in your history  
  i was too young and blind to see  
  i should ve known  i should ve known  
  the world was wide enough  
  for both hamilton and me  
  the world was wide enough  
  for both hamilton and me  
  let me tell you what i wish i d known  
  when i was young and dreamed of glory  
  you have no control  
 with company    who lives  who dies 
who tells your story   
president jefferson 
i ll give him this 
his financial system is a work of genius 
i couldn t undo it if i tried 
and i tried 
  who lives  who dies 
who tells your story   
president madison 
he took our country
from bankruptcy to prosperity 
i hate to admit it 
but he doesn t get enough credit
for all the credit that he gave us 
  who lives  who dies 
who tells your story   
  every other founding father s story
gets told  
  every other founding father
gets to grow old  
  and when you re gone
who remembers your name   
  who keeps your flame 
who tells your story   
 company    who tells your story 
who tells your story   
  eliza  
  i put myself back in the narrative  
  eliza  
  i stop wasting time on tears  
  i live another 50 years  
   it s not enough  
   eliza  
  i interview every soldier
who fought by your side  
  she tells our story  
  i try to make sense
of your thousands of pages of writings  
  you really do write
like you re running out of time  
   i rely on angelica  
   angelica  
  while she s alive  
   we tell your story  
   we tell your story  
  she is buried in trinity church  
   near you  
   near you  
  when i needed her most
she was right on time  
  and i m still not through  
  i ask myself   what would you do
if you had more time    
  the lord  in his kindness
he gives me what you always wanted  
  he gives me more time  
  i raise funds in dc
for the washington monument  
  she tells my story  
  i speak out against slavery  
  you could have done so much more
if you only had time  
  and when my time is up
have i done enough   
 with company 
  will they tell our story   
oh 
  can i show you what i m proudest of   
 company    the orphanage  
  i establish the first private orphanage
in new york city  
  the orphanage  
  i help to raise hundreds of children  
  i get to see them growing up  
  the orphanage  
  in their eyes i see you  alexander  
   i see you every time  
   time  
  and when my time is up
have i done enough   
   will they tell my story   
   will they tell your story   
  oh  i can t wait to see you again  
  it s only a matter of time  
  time  
   will they tell your story   
   time  
  who lives  who dies 
who tells your story   
  time  
   will they tell your story   
   time  
  who lives  who dies
