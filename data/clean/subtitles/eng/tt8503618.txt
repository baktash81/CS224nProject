how does a bastard orphan
son of a whore and a scotsman
dropped in the middle of
a forgotten spot in the caribbean
by providence
impoverished in squalor
grow up to be a hero and a scholar
the tendollar founding father
without a father
got a lot farther
by working a lot harder
by being a lot smarter
by being a selfstarter
by 14 they placed him
in charge of a trading charter
and every day while slaves
were being slaughtered
and carted away across the waves
he struggled and kept his guard up
inside he was longing
for something to be a part of
the brother was ready to beg
steal borrow or barter
then a hurricane came
and devastation reigned
our man saw his future
dripdripping down the drain
put a pencil to his temple
connected it to his brain
and he wrote his first refrain
a testament to his pain
well the word got around
they said this kid is insane man
took up a collection
just to send him to the mainland
get your education
dont forget from whence you came
and the worlds gonna know your name
whats your name man
alexander hamilton
my name is alexander hamilton
and theres a million things
i havent done
but just you wait
just you wait
when he was ten his father split
full of it debtridden
two years later
see alex and his mother bedridden
half dead sittin in their own sick
the scent thick and
company  alex got better
but his mother went quick
moved in with a cousin
the cousin committed suicide
left him with nothing but ruined pride
something new inside
a voice saying
with company
alex you gotta fend for yourself
solo  he started retreatin and readin
every treatise on the shelf
there wouldve been nothing left to do
for someone less astute
he wouldve been dead or destitute
without a cent of restitution
started working
clerking for his late mothers landlord
tradin sugarcane and rum
and all the things he cant afford
company  scammin
scammin for every book
he can get his hands on
company  plannin
plannin for the future
see him now as he stands on
the bow of a ship
headed for a new land
in new york you can be a new man
company
in new york you can be a new man
just you wait
in new york you can be a new man
just you wait
company
in new york you can be a new man
in new york new york

comin up from the bottom

a shiny piece of coal
tryin to reach my goal
my power of speech unimpeachable
only 19 but my mind is older
these new york city streets get colder
i shoulder every burden
every disadvantage
i have learned to manage
i dont have a gun to brandish
i walk these streets famished
the plan is to fan this spark
into a flame
but damn its getting dark
so let me spell out the name
i am the
alexander
we are meant to be
a colony that runs independently
meanwhile britain
keeps shittin on us endlessly
essentially they tax us relentlessly
then king george turns around
runs a spending spree
he aint ever gonna
set his descendants free
so there will be a revolution
in this century
enter me
he says in parentheses
and dont be shocked
when your history book mentions me
i will lay down my life
if it sets us free
eventually youll see my ascendancy
and i am not throwing away my shot

exclaims  anarchy
when i fight
i make the other side panicky
with my shot
yo im a tailors apprentice
and i got yall knuckleheads
in loco parentis
im joining the rebellion
cause i know its my chance
to socially advance
instead of sewin some pants
im gonna take a shot
shot
but well never be truly free
until those in bondage
have the same rights as you and me
you and i do or die
wait till i sally in on a stallion
with the first black battalion
have another shot
geniuses lower your voices
you keep out of trouble
and you double your choices
im with you
but the situation is fraught
youve got to be carefully taught
if you talk youre gonna get shot
burr check what we got
mr lafayette
hard rock like lancelot
i think your pants look hot
laurens i like you a lot
lets hatch a plot blacker
than the kettle callin the pot

i remember that dreamlike candlelight
like a dream that you cant quite place
but alexander ill never forget
the first time i saw your face
i have never been the same
intelligent eyes
in a hungerpang frame
and when you said hi
i forgot my dang name
set my heart aflame every part aflame
this is not a game
you strike me as a woman
who has never been satisfied
im sure i dont know what you mean
you forget yourself
youre like me
im never satisfied
is that right
i have never been satisfied
partygoers gasp
my name is angelica schuyler
alexander hamilton
wheres your family from
unimportant
theres a million things i havent done
but just you wait just you wait
so so so so this is
what it feels like to match wits
with someone at your level
what the hell is the catch
its the feeling of freedom
of seeing the light
its ben franklin with a key and a kite
you see it right
the conversation lasted two minutes
maybe three minutes
everything we said in total agreement
its a dream and its a bit of a dance
a bit of a posture
its a bit of a stance
hes a bit of a flirt
but imma give it a chance
i asked about his family
did you see his answer
his hands started fidgeting
he looked askance
hes penniless
hes flying by the seat of his pants
handsome boy does he know it
peach fuzz and he cant even grow it
i wanna take him
far away from this place
then i turn and see my sisters face
and she is
helpless
and i know she is
helpless
and her eyes are just
helpless
and i realize three fundamental truths
at the exact same time
where are you taking me
im about to change your life
then by all means lead the way
company  number one
im a girl in a world in which
my only job is to marry rich
my father has no sons so im the one
who has to social climb for one
cause im the oldest and the wittiest
and the gossip in new york city
is insidious
and alexander is penniless
ha that doesnt mean
i want him any less
elizabeth schuyler
its a pleasure to meet you
schuyler
my sister
company  number two
hes after me
cause im a schuyler sister
that elevates his status
id have to be naive to set that aside
maybe that is why
i introduced him to eliza
now thats his bride
nice going angelica he was right
you will never be satisfied
thank you for all your service
if it takes fighting a war for us to meet
it will have been worth it
ill leave you to it
company  number three
i know my sister
like i know my own mind
you will never find
anyone as trusting or as kind
if i tell her that i love him
shed be silently resigned
hed be mine
she would say im fine
shed be lying
shed be lying
but when i fantasize at night
its alexanders eyes
as i romanticize what might have been
if i hadnt sized him up so quickly
at least my dear elizas his wife
at least i keep his eyes in my life
to the groom
to the groom to the groom
to the groom
to the bride
to the bride to the bride
from your sister
angelica angelica angelica
whos always by your side
by your side
to your union
to the union to the revolution
and the hope that you provide
you provide you provide
may you always
always
be satisfied

hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
company  climb climb climb
he has something to prove
he has nothing to lose
company  lose lose lose lose
hamiltons pace is relentless
he wastes no time
time time time
what is it like in his shoes
hamilton doesnt hesitate
he exhibits no restraint
he takes and he takes and he takes
and he keeps winning anyway
changes the game
plays and he raises the stakes
and if theres a reason
he seems to thrive
when so few survive
then goddamn it
im willing to wait for it

life doesnt discriminate
between the sinners and the saints
it takes and it takes and it takes

local merchants

they only take british money
so sing a song of sixpence
cavalrys not coming

alex listen
theres only one way for us to win this
provoke outrage outright

he dismisses me out of hand
eliza  stay alive
instead of me he promotes
washington charles lee

im sorry is this not your speed
washington hamilton

yes sir
a thousand soldiers die
in 100degree heat
as we snatch a stalemate
from the jaws of defeat
charles lee was left behind
without a pot to piss in
he started saying this
to anybody who would listen
lee  washington cannot be left alone
to his devices
indecisive from crisis to crisis
the best thing he could do
for the revolution
is turn and go back to planting tobacco
in mount vernon
ooh
dont do a thing
history will prove him wrong
but sir
we have a war to fight
lets move along
strong words from lee
someone ought to hold him to it
i cant disobey direct orders
then ill do it
alexander
youre the closest friend ive got
laurens do not throw away your shot
company  one two three four
five six seven eight nine
its the ten duel commandments
its the ten duel commandments
number one
the challenge
demand satisfaction
if they apologize
no need for further action
number two
if they dont grab a friend
thats your second
your lieutenant
when theres reckoning to be reckoned
number three
have your seconds meet facetoface
burr  negotiate a peace
or negotiate a time and place
this is commonplace
especially between recruits
company
most disputes die and no one shoots
number four
if they dont reach a peace
thats all right
time to get some pistols
and a doctor on site
you pay him in advance
you treat him with civility
you have him turn around
so he can have deniability
five
duel before the sun is in the sky
company  pick a place to die
where its high and dry
number six
leave a note for your next of kin
tell em where you been
pray that hell or heaven lets you in
seven
lee  confess your sins
ready for the moment of adrenaline
when you finally face your opponent
company  number eight
your last chance to negotiate
send in your seconds
see if they can set the record straight
alexander
aaron burr sir
can we agree that duels
are dumb and immature
sure but your man has to answer
for his words burr
with his life
we both know thats absurd sir
hang on how many men died because
lee was inexperienced and ruinous
okay so were doing this
company  number nine
look em in the eye
aim no higher
summon all the courage you require
then count
company  one two three four
five six seven eight nine
number
ten paces
fire
gunshots
lee do you yield
you shot him in the side
yes he yields
im satisfied
yo we gotta clear the field
go we won
company  here comes the general
burr  this should be fun
what is the meaning of this
mr burr get a medic for the general
yes sir

but believe me
these young men dont speak for me
thank you for your service
lets ride
hamilton
sir
meet me inside
company
meet him inside meet him inside
meet him inside

son
dont call me son
this war is hard enough
without infighting
lee called you out
we called his bluff
you solve nothing
you aggravate our allies to the south
youre absolutely right
john should have shot him in the mouth
that wouldve shut him up
son
im not your son
watch your tone
i am not a maiden in need of defending
i am grown
charles lee thomas conway
these men take your name
and they rake it through the mud
my names been through a lot
i can take it
well i dont have your name
i dont have your titles
i dont have your land
but if you
no
if you gave me command of a battalion
a group of men to lead
i could fly above my station
after the war
or you could die and we need you alive
i am more than willing to die
your wife needs you alive son
i need you alive
call me son one more time
go home alexander
thats an order from your commander
sir
go home
look around look around
at how lucky we are
to be alive right now
look around look around
how long have you known
a month or so
eliza
you should have told me
i wrote to the general a month ago
no
i begged him to send you home
you should have told me
im not sorry
i knew youd fight
until the war was won
the wars not done
but you deserve a chance
to meet your son
look around look around
at how lucky we are
to be alive right now
will you relish
being a poor mans wife
unable to provide for your life
i relish being your wife
look around look around
look at where you are
look at where you started
the fact that youre alive
is a miracle
just stay alive
that would be enough
and if this child
shares a fraction of your smile
or a fragment of your mind
look out world
that would be enough
i dont pretend to know
the challenges youre facing
the worlds you keep erasing
and creating in your mind
but im not afraid
i know who i married
so long as you come home
at the end of the day
that would be enough
we dont need a legacy
we dont need money
if i could grant you peace of mind
if you could let me inside your heart
oh let me be a part of the narrative
in the story they will write someday
let this moment be the first chapter
where you decide to stay
and i could be enough
and we could be enough
that would be enough
audience cheering applauding
how does a ragtag volunteer army
in need of a shower
somehow defeat a global superpower
how do we emerge victorious
from the quagmire
leave the battlefield
waving betsy rosss flag higher
yo turns out we have a secret weapon
an immigrant you know and love
whos unafraid to step in
hes constantly confusing

this is where it gets me
on my feet the enemy ahead of me
if this is the end of me

weapon in my hand
a command and my men with me
then i remember
my elizas expecting me

take the bullets out your gun

we move undercover
and we move as one
through the night
we have one shot to live another day
we cannot let a stray gunshot
give us away
we will fight up close
seize the moment and stay in it
its either that
or meet the business end of a bayonet
the code word is rochambeau
dig me
rochambeau
you have your orders now
go men go
and so the american experiment begins
with my friends
all scattered to the winds
laurens is in south carolina
redefining bravery

throwing verbal rocks
at these mediocrities
hamilton

how you stand to the side
i will keep all my plans
close to my chest
wait for it wait for it wait
ill wait here
and see which way the wind will blow

watching the tension grow
i am sailing off to london
im accompanied

who will keep me in comfort
for all my days
he is not a lot of fun
but theres no one
who can match you for turn of phrase
my alexander
angelica
dont forget to write
look at where you are
look at where you started
the fact that youre alive
is a miracle
just stay alive
that would be enough
and if your wife could share
a fraction of your time
if i could grant you peace of mind
would that be enough
alexander joins forces
with james madison and john jay

the new united states constitution

to write a total of 25 essays
the work divided evenly
among the three men
in the end they wrote 85 essays
in the span of six months
john jay got sick after writing five
james madison wrote 29
hamilton wrote the other 51

in the world tonight
but youre here with us in new york city
are you ready for a cabinet meeting
audience cheering loudly
the issue on the table
secretary hamiltons plan to assume
state debt and establish a national bank
secretary jefferson
you have the floor sir
life liberty
and the pursuit of happiness
we fought for these ideals
we shouldnt settle for less
these are wise words
enterprising men quote em
dont act surprised you guys
cause i wrote em
ow but hamilton forgets
his plan would have the government
assume states debts
now place your bets
as to who that benefits
the very seat of government
where hamilton sits
not true
ooh if the shoe fits wear it
if new yorks in debt
why should virginia bear it
uh our debts are paid im afraid
dont tax the south
cause we got it made in the shade
in virginia we plant seeds in the ground
we create
you just wanna move our money around
this financial plan
is an outrageous demand
and its too many damn pages
for any man to understand
stand with me in the land of the free
pray to god we never see
hamiltons candidacy
look when britain taxed our tea
we got frisky
imagine what gon happen
when you try to tax our whiskey
washington thank you
secretary jefferson chuckles oh
audience laughing cheering
secretary hamilton your response
female cabinet member all right now
thomas that was
a real nice declaration
welcome to the present
were running a real nation
would you like to join us
or stay mellow
doin whatever the hell it is
you do in monticello
if we assume the debts
the union gets
a new line of credit
a financial diuretic
how do you not get it
if were aggressive and competitive
the union gets a boost
youd rather give it a sedative
a civics lesson from a slaver
hey neighbor your debts are paid
cause you dont pay for labor
we plant seeds in the south
we create
yeah keep ranting
we know whos really doing the planting
cabinet members murmuring
and another thing
mr age of enlightenment
dont lecture me about the war
you didnt fight in it
you think im frightened of you man
we almost died in a trench
while you were off getting high
with the french
thomas jefferson
always hesitant with the president
coughing
reticent
there isnt a plan he hasnt jettisoned
madison you mad as a hatter son
take your medicine
damn youre in worse shape
than the national debt is in
sittin there useless as two shits
hey turn around bend over
ill show you where my shoe fits
cabinet members shouting gasping
washington excuse me
madison jefferson take a walk

chuckles

after a brief recess chuckles
hamilton

you dont have the votes
madison jefferson
you dont have the votes
laughs
youre gonna need congressional approval
and you dont have the votes
such a blunder
sometimes it makes me wonder
why i even bring the thunder
why he even brings the thunder
audience cheering applauding
you wanna pull yourself together
im sorry
these virginians are birds of a feather
young man im from virginia
so watch your mouth
so we let congress
get held hostage by the south
you need the votes
no we need bold strokes
we need this plan
no you need to convince more folks
well james madison wont talk to me
thats a nonstarter
ah winning was easy young man
governings harder
theyre being intransigent
you have to find a compromise
they dont have a plan
they just hate mine
convince them otherwise
and what happens
if i dont get congressional approval
i imagine theyll call for your removal

hamilton
im sorry burr i gotta go
oh but uh
decisions are happening over dinner
two virginians and an immigrant
walk into a room
with company
diametrically opposed foes
they emerge with a compromise
having opened doors that were
with company  previously closed
company  bros
the immigrant emerges
with unprecedented financial power
a system he can shape however he wants
the virginians emerge
with the nations capital
and heres the pièce de résistance
no one else was in the room
where it happened
the room where it happened
the room where it happened
no one else was in the room
where it happened
the room where it happened
the room where it happened
no one really knows
how the game is played
the art of the trade
how the sausage gets made
we just assume that it happens
but no one else is in the room
where it happens
company  thomas claims
alexander was on washingtons doorstep
one day in distress and disarray
company  thomas claims
alexander said
i have nowhere else to turn
and basically begged me
to join the fray
company  thomas claims
i approached madison and said
i know you hate him
but lets hear what he has to say
company  thomas claims
well i arranged the meeting
i arranged the menu
the venue the seating
burr  but no one else was in the room
where it happened
the room where it happened
the room where it happened
no one else was in the room

the room where it happened
the room where it happened
no one really knows
how the parties get to yes
the pieces that are sacrificed
in every game of chess
we just assume that it happens
but no one else is in the room
where it happens
company  meanwhile
meanwhile madison is grappling
with the fact that not every issue
can be settled by committee
meanwhile
congress is fighting
over where to put the capital
overlapping screams
it isnt pretty
then jefferson approaches
with a dinner and invite
and madison responds
with virginian insight
maybe we can solve one problem
with another
and win a victory for the southerners
in other words
oh ho
a quid pro quo
i suppose
wouldnt you like to work
a little closer to home
actually i would
well i propose the potomac
and youll provide him his votes
well well see how it goes
lets go
burr  no

from new york
eliza  new york
eliza philip  our senator
burr since when are you
a democraticrepublican
since being one put me
on the upandup again
no one knows who you are
or what you do
hey they dont need to know me
they dont like you
excuse me
oh wall street thinks youre great
youll always be adored
by the things you create
but upstate
wait
people think youre crooked
and schuylers seat was up for grabs
so i took it
ive always considered you a friend
i dont see why that has to end
you changed parties
to run against my fatherinlaw
i changed parties
to seize the opportunity i saw
i swear your pride
will be the death of us all
beware it goeth before the fall
the issue on the table
france is on the verge of war
with england
now do we commit money and aid to our
french allies or do we stay out of it
remember my decision on this matter
is not subject to congressional approval
the only one you have to convince is me
secretary jefferson
you have the floor sir
when we were on deaths door
when we were needy
we made a promise
we signed a treaty
we needed money and guns
and half a chance
uh who provided those funds
france
in return they didnt ask for land
only a promise that wed lend a hand
and stand with them
if they fought against oppressors
and revolution is messy
but now is the time to stand
cabinet members cheer
stand with our brothers
as they fight against tyranny
cabinet members uhhuh
i know that alexander hamilton is here
and he would rather not
have this debate
ill remind you
that he is not secretary of state
cabinet members oh
he knows nothing of loyalty
smells like new money
dresses like fake royalty
desperate to rise above his station
everything he does betrays
the ideals of our nation
cabinet members murmuring
ay and if you dont know
now you know mr president
thank you secretary jefferson
secretary hamilton your response
cabinet member get him boy
cabinet member 2 let him know right now
you must be outta your goddamn mind
if you think
the president is gonna
bring the nation to the brink
of meddling in the middle
of a military mess
a game of chess
where france is queen and kingless
we signed a treaty with a king
whose head is now in a basket
would you like to take it out
and ask it
oh should we honor our treaty
king louiss head
ah do whatever you want
im super dead
cabinet members murmur
washington  enough enough
hamilton is right
mr president
were too fragile
to start another fight
sir do we not fight for freedom
sure when the french figure out
whos gonna lead em
the people are leading
the people are rioting
theres a difference
frankly its a little disquieting
you would let your ideals
blind you to reality
hamilton
sir
draft a statement of neutrality
yes sir
did you forget lafayette
what
have you an ounce of regret
you accumulate debt
you accumulate power
yet in their hour of need you forget
lafayettes a smart man
hell be fine
and before he was your friend
he was mine
if we try to fight
in every revolution in the world
we never stop
where do we draw the line
so quickwitted
alas i admit it
i bet you were quite a lawyer
my defendants got acquitted
yeah
well someone ought to remind you
what
youre nothing
without washington behind you
washington hamilton
daddys calling
it must be nice
it must be nice
to have washington on your side
jefferson chuckles scoffs
it must be nice
it must be nice
to have washington on your side
every action
has its equal opposite reaction
thanks to hamilton
our cabinets fractured into factions
try not to crack under the stress
were breaking down like fractions
we smack each other in the press
and we dont print retractions
i get no satisfaction
witnessing his fits of passion
the way he primps and preens
and dresses like the pits of fashion
our poorest citizens our farmers
live ration to ration
as wall street robs em blind
in search of chips to cash in
this prick is asking
for someone to bring him to task
somebody give me some dirt
on this vacuous mass
so we can at last unmask him
ill pull the trigger on him
someone load the gun and cock it
while we were all watching
he got washington in his pocket
burr jefferson  it must be nice
it must be nice
to have washington on your side
it must be nice
it must be nice
to have washington on your side
look back at the bill of rights
which i wrote
the ink hasnt dried
it must be nice it must be nice
to have washington on your side
so hes doubled
the size of the government
wasnt the trouble with much
of our previous government size
look in his eyes
see how he lies
follow the scent of his enterprise
centralizing national credit
and making american credit competitive
if we dont stop it
we aid and abet it
i have to resign
somebody has to stand up for the south
or somebody has to
stand up to his mouth
if theres a fire
youre trying to douse
you cant put it out
from inside the house
im in the cabinet i am complicit
in watching him grabbin at power
and kiss it
if washington isnt gon listen
to disciplined dissidents
this is the difference
this kid is out
oh this immigrant
isnt somebody we chose
oh this immigrants
keeping us all on our toes
oh lets show these federalists
who theyre up against
oh southern mother
democraticrepublicans
oh now follow the money
and see where it goes
oh
because every second
the treasury grows
oh
if we follow the money
and see where it leads
get in the weeds look for the seeds
of hamiltons misdeeds
it must be nice it must be nice
we follow the money
and see where it goes
it must be nice it must be nice
the emperor has no clothes
we wont be invisible
we wont be denied
still it must be nice
it must be nice
to have washington on your side
mr president you asked to see me
i know youre busy
what do you need sir sir
i wanna give you a word of warning
sir i dont know what you heard
but whatever it is jefferson started it
washington chuckles
audience laughing
thomas jefferson resigned this morning
youre kidding
i need a favor
whatever you say sir
jefferson will pay for his behavior
shh talk less
ill use the press
ill write under a pseudonym
youll see what i can do to him
i need you to draft an address
yes he resigned
you can finally speak your mind
no hes stepping down
so he can run for president
ha good luck defeating you sir
im stepping down
im not running for president
im sorry what
audience chuckling
one last time
relax have a drink with me
one last time
lets take a break tonight
and then well teach em
how to say goodbye
to say goodbye
you and i
no sir why
i want to talk about neutrality
sir with britain and france
on the verge of war
is this the best time
i want to warn
against partisan fighting
pick up a pen start writing
i wanna talk about what i have learned
the hardwon wisdom i have earned
as far as the people are concerned
you have to serve
you could continue to serve
no one last time
the people will hear from me
one last time
and if we get this right
were gonna teach em
how to say goodbye
you and i
mr president
they will say youre weak
no they will see were strong
your position is so unique
so ill use it to move them along
why do you have to say goodbye
if i say goodbye
the nation learns to move on
it outlives me when im gone
like the scripture says
everyone shall sit
under their own vine and fig tree
and no one shall make them afraid
theyll be safe in the nation
weve made
i want to sit under my own vine
and fig tree
a moment alone in the shade
at home in this nation weve made
one last time
one last time
though in reviewing the incidents
of my administration
i am unconscious of intentional error
i am nevertheless too sensible
of my defects
not to think it probable
that i may have committed many errors
i shall also carry with me the hope
that my country will view them
with indulgence
together and that after 45 years
of my life dedicated to its service
with an upright zeal
the faults of incompetent abilities
will be consigned to oblivion
as i myself must soon be
to the mansions of rest
i anticipate with pleasing expectation
that retreat
in which i promise myself to realize
both continue
the sweet enjoyment of partaking
in the midst of my fellow citizens
the benign influence of good laws
under a free government
the everfavorite object of my heart
and the happy reward as i trust
of our mutual cares
labors
and dangers
one last time
female company
george washingtons going home
teach em how to say goodbye
company
george washingtons going home
you and i
george washingtons going home
going home
george washingtons going home
history has its eyes on you

to say goodbye
say goodbye one last time
one last time
time
audience cheering applauding
audience laughing
they say
george washingtons yielding his power
and stepping away
is that true
i wasnt aware that was something
a person could do
audience laughing
im perplexed

replacing whoevers in charge
if so whos next
theres nobody else in their country
who looms quite as large
what
john adams
audience laughing
laughing continues
i know him
that cant be
thats that little guy who spoke to me
all those years ago

audience cheering applauding
how does hamilton the shorttempered
protean creator of the coast guard
founder of the new york post
audience laughing
ardently abuse his cabinet post
destroy his reputation
welcome folks
to the adams administration
jeffersons the runnerup
which makes him the vice president
washington cant help you now
no more mr nice president
adams fires hamilton
privately calls him creole bastard
in his taunts
say what
hamilton publishes his response
sit down john you fat motherbleep
burr hamiltons out of control
this is great hes out of power
he holds no office
and he just destroyed
president john adams
the only other significant member
of his party
hamilton is a host unto himself
as long as he can hold a pen
hes a threat
lets let him know what we know
mr vice president
mr madison
audience chuckling
senator burr
what is this
we have the check stubs
from separate accounts
almost a thousand dollars
paid in different amounts
to a mr james reynolds
way back in 1791
is that what you have
are you done
you are uniquely situated
by virtue of your position
though virtue is not a word
id apply to this situation
to seek financial gain
to stray from your sacred mission
and the evidence suggests
youve engaged in speculation
an immigrant embezzling
our government funds
i can almost see the headline
your career is done
i hope you saved some money
for your daughter and sons
you best gwan run back
where you come from
ha you dont even know
what youre asking me to confess
confess
you have nothing
i dont have to tell you anything at all
unless
unless
if i can prove
that i never broke the law
do you promise not to tell
another soul what you saw
no one else was in the room
where it happened
is that a yes
all um yes
audience chuckles
dear sir i hope this letter
finds you in good health
and in a prosperous enough
position to put wealth
in the pockets of people like me
down on their luck
you see that was my wife
who you decided to
what
audience laughs
she courted me escorted me to bed
and when she had me in a corner
thats when reynolds extorted me
for a sordid fee i paid him quarterly
i may have mortally wounded my prospects
but my papers are orderly
as you can see i kept a record
of every check in my checkered history
check it again against your list
and see consistency
i never spent a cent that wasnt mine
you sent the dogs after my scent
thats fine
yes i have reasons for shame
but i have not committed treason
and sullied my good name
as you can see i have done nothing
to provoke legal action
are my answers to your satisfaction
my god
audience laughing
gentlemen lets go
so
madison jefferson
the people wont know what we know
hamilton burr
how do i know
you wont use this against me
the next time we go toe to toe
alexander rumors only grow
and we both know what we know
echoes  know know
in the eye of a hurricane
there is quiet
for just a moment
a yellow sky
when i was 17
a hurricane destroyed my town
i didnt drown
i couldnt seem to die
i wrote my way out
wrote everything down
far as i could see
i wrote my way out
i looked up
and the town had its eyes on me
they passed a plate around
and total strangers
moved to kindness
by my story
raised enough for me to book passage
on a ship that was new yorkbound
i wrote my way out of hell
i wrote my way to revolution
i was louder
than the crack in the bell
i wrote eliza love letters
until she fell
i wrote about the constitution
and defended it well
and in the face
of ignorance and resistance
i wrote financial systems
into existence
and when my prayers to god
were met with indifference
i picked up a pen
i wrote my own deliverance
in the eye of a hurricane
there is quiet
for just a moment
a yellow sky
i was 12 when my mother died
she was holding me
we were sick and she was holding me
i couldnt seem to die
female company
wait for it wait for it wait for it
ill write my way out
wait for it wait for it wait for it
write everything down far as i can see
wait for it wait for it
wait for it wait for it
ill write my way out
overwhelm them with honesty
this is the eye of the hurricane
this is the only way
i can protect my legacy
wait for it wait for it wait for it
wait
the reynolds pamphlet
company
the reynolds pamphlet
have you read this
alexander hamilton had a torrid affair
and he wrote it down right there
highlights
the charge against me is a connection
with one james reynolds
for purposes of improper speculation
my real crime is an amorous connection
with his wife
for a considerable time
with his knowing consent
damn
i had frequent meetings with her
most of them at my own house
burr  at his own house
madison  at his own house
electronic voice damn

jefferson electronic voice
the reynolds pamphlet
jefferson electronic voice
have you read this
you ever see somebody
ruin their own life
his poor wife
i saved every letter you wrote me
from the moment i read them
i knew you were mine
you said you were mine
i thought you were mine
do you know what angelica said
when we saw your first letter arrive
she said
be careful with that one love
he will do what it takes to survive
you and your words flooded my senses
your sentences left me defenseless
you built me palaces out of paragraphs
you built cathedrals
im rereading the letters you wrote me
im searching and scanning for answers
in every line for some kind of sign
and when you were mine
the world seemed
to burn
burn
you published the letters
she wrote you
you told the whole world
how you brought this girl into our bed
in clearing your name
you have ruined our lives
do you know what angelica said
when she read what youd done
she said youve married an icarus
hes flown too close to the sun
you and your words
obsessed with your legacy
your sentences border on senseless
and you are paranoid
in every paragraph
how they perceive you
you you you
im erasing myself from the narrative
let future historians wonder
how eliza reacted
when you broke her heart
you have torn it all apart
im watching it burn
watching it burn
the world has no right to my heart
the world has no place in our bed
they dont get to know what i said
im burning the memories
burning the letters
that might have redeemed you
you forfeit all rights to my heart
you forfeit the place in our bed
youll sleep in your office instead
with only the memories
of when you were mine
sighs
i hope that you
burn
audience applauding cheering

there are moments
that the words dont reach
there is suffering
too terrible to name
you hold your child
as tight as you can
and push away the unimaginable
the moments when youre in so deep
it feels easier to just swim down
with company
the hamiltons move uptown
and learn to live
with the unimaginable
i spend hours in the garden
i walk alone to the store
and its quiet uptown
i never liked the quiet before
i take the children
to church on sunday
a sign of the cross at the door
and i pray
that never used to happen before
female company
if you see him in the street
walking by himself
talking to himself
have pity
philip you would like it uptown
its quiet uptown
female company
he is working through the unimaginable
male company
his hair has gone grey
he passes every day
they say he walks
the length of the city

i fall apart
full company

look at where we started
i know i dont deserve you eliza
but hear me out
that would be enough
if i could spare his life
if i could trade his life for mine

and you would smile
and that would be enough
i dont pretend to know
the challenges were facing
i know theres no replacing
what weve lost
and you need time
but im not afraid

so now im facing aaron burr
aaron burr
with his own faction
hes very attractive in the north
new yorkers like his chances
hes not very forthcoming
on any particular stances
ask him a question it glances off
he obfuscates he dances
and they say im a francophile
at least they know
i know where france is
thomas thats the problem see

just to keep me from winning
i wanna be in the room
where it happens
the room where it happens
the room where it happens
youve kept me from
the room where it happens
for the last time
dear alexander
i am slow to anger
but i toe the line
as i reckon with the effects
of your life on mine
i look back on where i failed
and in every place i checked
the only common thread
has been your disrespect
now you call me amoral
a dangerous disgrace
if youve got something to say
name a time and place
facetoface
i have the honor to be
your obedient servant
a dot burr
mr vice president
i am not the reason no one trusts you
no one knows what you believe
i will not equivocate on my opinion
i have always worn it on my sleeve
even if i said what you think i said
you would need to cite
a more specific grievance
heres an itemized list
of 30 years of disagreements
burr sweet jesus
hey i have not been shy
i am just a guy in the public eye
trying to do my best for our republic
i dont wanna fight
but i wont apologize
for doing whats right
i have the honor to be
your obedient servant
a dot ham
careful how you proceed good man
intemperate indeed good man
answer for the accusations
i lay at your feet
or prepare to bleed good man
burr your grievance is legitimate
i stand by what i said

you stand only for yourself
its what you do
i cant apologize because its true
then stand alexander

hamilton burr
i have the honor to be
your obedient servant
a dot ham
a dot burr
alexander come back to sleep
i have an early meeting out of town
its still dark outside

why do you write
like youre running out of time
shushes
come back to bed
that would be enough
ill be back before you know im gone
come back to sleep
this meetings at dawn
well im going back to sleep
hey
best of wives and best of women
company  one two three four
five six seven eight nine
burr  there are ten things
you need to know
company  number one
burr  we rode across the hudson
at dawn
my friend william p van ness
signed on
as my number two
company  number two
burr  hamilton arrived with his crew
nathaniel pendleton
and a doctor that he knew
company  number three
burr  i watched hamilton
examine the terrain
i wish i could tell you
what was happening in his brain
this man has poisoned
my political pursuits
company
most disputes die and no one shoots
number four
burr  hamilton drew first position
looking to the world
like a man on a mission
this is a soldier
with a marksmans ability
the doctor turned around
so he could have deniability
company  five
now i didnt know this at the time
but we were
near the same spot your son died
near the same spot my son died
is that why
company  six
burr  he examined his gun
with such rigor
i watched as he methodically
fiddled with the trigger
company  seven
burr  confession time
heres what i got
my fellow soldiersll tell you
im a terrible shot
company  number eight
burr hamilton
your last chance to negotiate
send in your seconds
see if they can
set the record straight
burr  they wont teach you this
in your classes
but look it up
hamilton was wearing his glasses
why if not to take deadly aim
its him or me
the world will never be the same
i had only one thought
before the slaughter
this man will not make
an orphan of my daughter
company  number nine
burr  look him in the eyes
aim no higher
summon all the courage you require
then count
company  one two three four
five six seven eight nine
number ten paces fire
gunshot
hamilton  i imagine death so much
it feels more like a memory
is this where it gets me
on my feet several feet ahead of me
i see it coming
do i run or fire my gun or let it be
there is no beat no melody
burr my first friend my enemy
maybe the last face i ever see
if i throw away my shot
is this how you remember me
what if this bullet is my legacy
legacy
what is a legacy
its planting seeds in a garden
you never get to see
i wrote some notes
at the beginning of a song
someone will sing for me
america you great unfinished symphony
you sent for me
you let me make a difference
a place where even orphan immigrants
can leave their fingerprints and rise up
im running out of time
im running and my times up
wise up eyes up
i catch a glimpse of the other side
laurens leads a soldiers chorus
on the other side
my son is on the other side
hes with my mother on the other side
washington is watching
from the other side
teach me how to say goodbye
rise up rise up rise up
eliza
my love take your time
breathes shakily
ill see you on the other side
raise a glass to freedom
company he aims his pistol at the sky
wait
gunshot
i strike him right between his ribs
i walk towards him
but i am ushered away
they row him back across the hudson
i get a drink
company vocalizing
i hear wailing in the streets
vocalizing
somebody tells me youd better hide
vocalizing
they say angelica and eliza
were both at his side when he died
death doesnt discriminate
between the sinners and the saints
it takes and it takes and it takes
history obliterates
in every picture it paints
it paints me in all my mistakes
when alexander aimed at the sky
he may have been the first one to die
but im the one who paid for it
i survived but i paid for it
now im the villain in your history
i was too young and blind to see
i shouldve known i shouldve known
the world was wide enough
for both hamilton and me
the world was wide enough
for both hamilton and me
let me tell you what i wish id known
when i was young and dreamed of glory
you have no control
with company  who lives who dies
who tells your story
president jefferson
ill give him this
his financial system is a work of genius
i couldnt undo it if i tried
and i tried
who lives who dies
who tells your story
president madison
he took our country
from bankruptcy to prosperity
i hate to admit it
but he doesnt get enough credit
for all the credit that he gave us
who lives who dies
who tells your story
every other founding fathers story
gets told
every other founding father
gets to grow old
and when youre gone
who remembers your name
who keeps your flame
who tells your story
company  who tells your story
who tells your story
eliza
i put myself back in the narrative
eliza
i stop wasting time on tears
i live another 50 years
its not enough
eliza
i interview every soldier
who fought by your side
she tells our story
i try to make sense
of your thousands of pages of writings
you really do write
like youre running out of time
i rely on angelica
angelica
while shes alive
we tell your story
we tell your story
she is buried in trinity church
near you
near you
when i needed her most
she was right on time
and im still not through
i ask myself what would you do
if you had more time
the lord in his kindness
he gives me what you always wanted
he gives me more time
i raise funds in dc
for the washington monument
she tells my story
i speak out against slavery
you could have done so much more
if you only had time
and when my time is up
have i done enough
with company
will they tell our story
oh
can i show you what im proudest of
company  the orphanage
i establish the first private orphanage
in new york city
the orphanage
i help to raise hundreds of children
i get to see them growing up
the orphanage
in their eyes i see you alexander
i see you every time
time
and when my time is up
have i done enough
will they tell my story
will they tell your story
oh i cant wait to see you again
