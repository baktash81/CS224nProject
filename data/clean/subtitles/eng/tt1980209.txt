 grunts 
 grunts 
i m hot 
i m big 
 sirens wailing 
fuck 
 sirens continue 
 officers yelling indistinctly 
 panting 
shit 
 in distinct radio chatter 
hey  where you going 
 inaudible 
daniel  my name is daniel lugo 
and i believe in fitness 
ed  the events you are about to see
took place
in miami  florida  between
october 1994 and june  95 
unfortunately  this is a true story 
daniel  we all start out equal 
little blobs of blood and muscle 
it s a setup of awesome potential 
most people never
develop that potential 
  i knew early on i was not most people 
 grunting 
there you go  there you go 
 laughing  yes 
come on  big man 
work it  baby  come on 
let s go 
because if you re willing to do the work 
you can have anything 
that s what makes the us of a great 
when it started 
america was just a handful
of scrawny colonies 
now  it s the most buff 
pumped up country on the planet 
  that s pretty rad 
 grunts 
that s it 
  work harder 
  shit 
 laughs  oh  adrian s on the juice 
  word up  dl 
most people say
they want to look better 
not everyone is willing
to do whatever it takes to achieve it 
all of my heroes are self made 
rocky  scarface 
all the guys from the godfather 
they all started out with nothing
and built their way to perfection 
the way to prove yourself
is to better yourself 
that s the american dream 
 panting 
i have no sympathy
for people who squander their gifts 
it s sickening 
it s worse than sickening 
it s unpatriotic 
greatest day of my life 
arnold fucking schwarzenegger 
am i right 
i was never a big fitness guy 
i know it s important 
but you know what
i really don t like about weights 
what s that 
they re so heavy 
 chuckles  am i right 
can you lift this 
 grunts 
i spot people for a living 
when you get right down to it 
gives the client security
and a little extra help
to push themselves harder 
 roaring 
to me  a cigarette boat was a thing
drug dealers had  you know 
but we got it anyway  cost a fortune 
named her puppy luv 
l u v  but when i m out on it 
depending on the day  i either fantasize
i m a drug smuggler eluding the dea 
or i m the dea
chasing after a drug smuggler 
 grunts  i m turning into a stud here 
you get any exercise currently 
eh    besides shtupping 
i got a three mil mcmansion
next to a private jogging path 
but it s all homos and housewives 
you spend most of your day at a desk 
you know that schlotzsky s deli
near the airport 
that s mine 
no kidding  oh  i like that place 
i never kid  yudo 
  lugo 
  yeah 
we make a nice sandwich  lugy 
you ever try our oven toasted
roast beef and cheese 
  give an anorexic an appetite 
  what else do you do 
do some stock trading  real estate 
own a few greyhounds for racing 
but for some crazy reason 
i m proudest of the sandwiches 
i hang at the house 
got a hot cuban housekeeper
makes a waffle don t
even need maple syrup 
i m a self made man  dennis 
and my self is not ashamed to
say it s made a lot of money 
maybe your self
ought to spend some of it on a salad 
you know who invented salad 
poor people 
daniel  this all began because
it was time to push myself harder 
to maximize results 
and i was tired of clients petting me 
shit  otherwise
i was looking at another 40 years
of wearing sweatpants to work 
barbara ann  and that was it 
he just dumped me by phone 
daniel  that s cold 
it makes you question
the whole relationship 
daniel  you set high goals for yourself
and nail every one 
but the hardest thing
about changing yourself
is changing how other people see you 
being a personal trainer
is just that  personal 
i m not going to lie 
when a client doesn t
feel the same way 
il  hurts 
what next 
well  i mean  if you wanted 
you know  if it seems
like it would be fun to you 
maybe we could go for a drink
or a dinner or a coffee or water 
i meant what exercise is next 
daniel  it really fucking hurts 
 laughing  i know that 
i was joking  come on 
daniel  i see you got some new meat 
what have i always said  john 
the key to repeat business   
ls new business  you cannot build
a muscle mecca without muscle 
 sniffs 
well  i want to turn this place
into an internationally renowned mecca 
  what do you bench 
  400 
  squat 
  more like five 
 sighs 
why should i hire you 
you have a lot of elderly members  sir 
i want to pump
some new blood into this place 
that pool s a very slippery surface
and that elderly woman
with the shower cap 
she looks like she s going to croak
right there in the pool  sir 
and gold s is going to crush you 
if i don t triple your membership
in three months  i will quit 
triple it in three months 
that s pretty ambitious 
i read a lot of biographies  sir 
and the one thing that unites great men
is their reach always
exceeds their grasp 
one thing   
i recently had some trouble with the law 
they call florida  god s waiting room  
all the half dead senior citizens
turning brown on the beach 
shit  you ask me  that s kind of mean 
i like older people 
they re very generous 
so  you really guarantee
i can triple
my investment in three months 
well  if i didn t  would i have
put my name on the company 
let me confer with my partner 
are they good 
  you re approved 
  wow   chuckles 
you know  i get so much joy
from making people money 
i m going to make
you guys a lot of money 
you have such beautiful hair 
look at those eyes  wow 
i  daniel lugo  hereby
acknowledge my guilt 
i know what i did was wrong
and there is no substitute for hard work 
and i am a hard worker 
and it will never happen again 
for i used my superior intelligence
for wrong actions to justify a good end 
and that was wrong 
and  if you let me 
i believe i can learn from my mistakes
and i believe i can help others
to realize that there is
no shortcut to the american dream 
this is america  land of the brave
and home of the second chances 
that s my one ask 
that you give me a second chance
and allow me to go free today 
judge  guilty 
i know i m guilty  that s what i said
in the beginning of my statement 
i said   i m guilty  
but what about my second chance 
 cell door rattling
and closing 
 scoffs 
that s nothing  welcome aboard 
thank you  sir  i will not disappoint you 
daniel  three weeks after i signed on 
sun gym did triple its membership 
i ma make you kobe beef  baby

of our entry point 
paul  danny was a mastermind 
we hit him in the house
as soon as possible 
bring him out
right through the front door 
through the bushes and back to the van 
delta force could do a mission
like this in probably 53 seconds 
but with our athletic superiority 
we should be able to do it
in about 40  all right 
one problem  he s got a live in maid 
so if she s there

adrian  i knew danny was

just bring him by tomorrow 
look  my friend 
he cannot come back  okay 
this is a very unique situation 
he s out there trying
to impact the world in a positive way 
no  that s the only reason for a notary 
is that i have to
witness the signing of the document 
otherwise  somebody
could just come in off the street 
forge somebody s signature
and take all their shit 
you know  i got a stamp 
can i borrow it 
no  you can t borrow my stamp 
that s sacred 
what the fuck are notaries  man

bring your daughter to work day 
don t you listen 
they forced chocolate liqueur down me 
the evil ninja weightlifters 
those are the guys 
you should cut
some of that fuzz out of your ears 
daniel lugo  write it down 
from what i hear 
mr  vic  pepe  kershaw 
they sell quite a bit
of drugs in colombia 
god  i can t believe this 
i m having some trouble with it myself 
you say you were bound  abused
and roughed up by
a group of bodybuilders 
was this a sex thing 
what 
one very large burnt dildo 
baseball sized anal beads found
in the back of your car 
not normal stuff 
we re finding it hard to believe
that no one reported you missing 
not one single person 
this could be a wake up call  buddy 
 stammering 
wait a second  is that all i get 
get back here 
  i don t believe a word he said 
  mmm mmm 
daniel  
we stack loaded 3 000 protein calories 
looking tough  feeling tough 
we were going to rock it 
we didn t find kershaw s obit 
we found him alive  at the hospital 
so we had some unfinished business 
oh  i m not going to make it 
i m not going to make it   
can you keep him quiet 
 groaning 
victor    oh  christ 
 seagulls cawing 
ed  being a cop for so long 
i ve learned that
people s lives are usually linear 
until they re not 
comes a day
for just about everyone when a
suddenly skips b
and careens to polka dot weird w
best move i ever made
was marrying cissy 
sweetie pie  are you deaf 
  the phone has rung  like  19 times 
 phone ringing 
twenty 
sorry  babe  i didn t hear it 
after i retired 
i reopened the detective agency
my old man used to own 
but after a few years 
cissy begged me to retire from that  too 
she said i d earned my relaxing years
with long  lazy days
full of golf and fishing 
except the only thing
i hate more than golf is fishing 
du bois investigators  inc 
is this ed du bois the second 
actually  it s ed the third 
i want ed the second 
he s dead  and i m retired 
i m guessing you re looking at
a hell of an old yellow pages  buddy 
everything s old in this frickin  hospital 
 toilet flushing 
  it just shot out of my ass 
  i couldn t help it 
nurse   gasps  oh 
oh  god 
he should be ejected from this facility 
nurse  oh  my god   
not you 
 stammering  i need your help 
i m a desperate man 
what did you say your name was 
 elevator dings 
daniel  the team explored
a number of infiltration procedures 
adrian even offered to stage
a diversionary fistfight in the hall 
we decided against that 
but i can t say that
what the police told you
is far from my own analysis 
i have to entertain
the possibility that you might be lying 
daniel  there was one major problem 
this fucking archaic
line directory system
throughout the whole entire hospital 
it took us an hour just to find the icu 
victor  please believe me 
it happened just the way i say it did 
yeah  well  i m sorry  mr  kershaw 
but i can t take the case 
i m a dead man 
a hospital is a very public place 
and anybody could gain
access to your room 
and if it were me  and some large men
were trying to re kill me 
and i wanted to stay un dead 
i d get the hell out of there  fast 
 disconnects 
daniel  in the end 
after reviewing our past performance 
we could come to only one conclusion 
we re so much better when we wing it 
 indistinct conversations 
doctor 
can i help you with something 
i m dr  lowenstein 
uh  mr  kershaw s
primary care physician 
he didn t mention anything 
oh  well  i m  uh   
i m over at miami general 
where is victor 
he checked himself out 
against my advice 
i think the visit
from the police scared him 
police  what did they want 
oh  accident investigation 
they didn t seem too thrilled
by mr  kershaw s account of events 
he claimed he d been tortured 
by bodybuilders 
  bodybuilders 
  yes 
this is a case of delusional
alcoholism  it s not uncommon 
you know  i warned him about that 
why are you dressed for
surgery in our hospital 
well  i like to be prepared for anything 
 dance music playing 
gentlemen

ed  victor  for god s sake 
he s right  ed  we fucked up 
the fact is  mr  kershaw  right now 
you re the only source of funding

he put all his eggs

under 24 hour watch 
lugo s gonna come up starving soon

manager

while i m here  right

authorizing us to freeze

hey  officer 
 groans 
 people scream 
where are they all 
he s a thief 
 tires screeching 
 people shouting 
daniel  son of a bitch 
sometimes god just fucks up your order
and you got to chow down
on that shitty shame sandwich 
 people clamoring 
look at you 
all fucked up 
it s kind of undignified
being all fucked up by a car 
isn t it  you silly turd 
  you all right 
victor    i m getting there 
you know  i could have
got you ripped  man 
you know what your problem is 
skinnyass quads 
you got no quads  man 
that was my problem 
i spent a lot of time
building these bad boys 
is this all for me 
yep  your own little party 
wow 
they re going
to want to know why you did it 
well   cause i m a do er 
ed  this was the longest and most
bizarre trial in dade county history 
prosecutor 
so  the central intelligence agency 
so you were a stripper and an agent 
or  as you call yourself 
a field operative 
lugo and i used to bang a lot 
but then he passed me to agent doyle 
miss you  sweetie 
but i m going to quit the whole cia thing
to become a movie star 
ed  they say truth
is stranger than fiction 
and no one tells the truth
like a pissed off wife 
sir  i officially divorced him last night 
that s why i can testify
against him today 
well  i ve been working
in the penis industry for 19 months 
i think he lifted weights
to try to compensate
for the fact that he had a very tiny penis 
it was bent on a 25 degree angle 
like a boomerang 
you see  erectile dysfunction
is nothing to be ashamed about
but being an unfaithful lying shit
who i know for a fact tried to finger bang
his paralegal in the interview room 
that s a little shamey 
but being in the medical profession 
i prefer not to judge 
but that lady s a whore 
  yeah  you  you fucking bitch 
  no further questions 
ed  the state was very thorough 
frankly  it had a lot to make up for 
we re going to walk on this 
they ain t got no proof 
at first  the evidence
was mostly circumstantial 
physical proof of the murders
being hard to come by 
eventually  they found
the barrels and bodies 
but no fingerprints 
and then  for the first time
in the history of the united states   
prosecutor  two 750 cc breast implants 
ed     they used the manufacturer s
unique serial numbers for identification 
paul doyle seemed to embrace
the concept of confession 
they kidnapped kershaw 
they tried to kill him 
i just want to go back to prison 
they used chainsaws to cut them up 
he said no one would get hun  
they hurt pepe 
they hurt him bad  they hun  my friend 
manipulator of manipulators 
paul  wow  that felt good 
all they got is testimony
from some fucking cokehead 
ed  in the end  though 
all justice really needed
to do was listen to
the right guy at the right time 
in light of his cooperation 
mr  doyle was given only 15 years 
a sentence for which
he seemed legitimately grateful 
i once was lost
but now i m found   
ed  daniel lugo and adrian doorbal
were found guilty
of double murder  racketeering 
attempted extortion  theft 
attempted murder  armed robbery 
burglary  money laundering and forgery 
in fact  the only thing
they weren t found guilty of
was the one thing
they were most guilty of 
being dumb stupid fucks 
it took the jury only 14 minutes
to sentence them both to death 
 sighs 
this seems like such a waste 
people s lives 
you know 
some people just don t
know a good thing
when it s staring them in the face 
 sighs 
ed  it really is the simple things in life 
daniel just wanted to be like everyone 
everyone that wants
the american dream 
daniel  all i ever wanted out of life
was what everyone else had 
not more 
just not the less i was used to 
well  i took a real swing for it 
you know 
and for a while  it was like
i always thought it would be 
i was one of you 
and it felt good 
people finally saw me like i saw myself
and you can t ask for more than that 
maybe i did  though 
maybe it got so i didn t want to
be  equal to  anymore 
i wanted to be  better than  
and that s a recipe for injury 
that doesn t mean you give up  though 
you rest  you heal and
you get back on that bench 
life is going to give me another set 
and i am going to rock it
