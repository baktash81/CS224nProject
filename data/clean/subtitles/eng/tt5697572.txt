you must have another 
another 
the naming of cats
is a difficult matter 
it isn t just
one of your holiday games 
you may think at first
i m as mad as a hatter
when i tell you a cat must
have three different names 
first of all 
there s the name
that the family use daily 
such as   
  peter 
  augustus 
  alonzo 
  or james 
but i tell you a cat needs
a name that s particular 
a name that s peculiar
and more dignified 
chorus  in unison  
else how can he keep up
his tail perpendicular 
or spread out his whiskers 
or cherish his pride 
but above and beyond 
there s still
one name left over 
and that is the name
that you never will guess 
the name that no human research
can discover 
but the cat herself knows
and will never confess 
when you notice a cat
in profound meditation 
the reason  i tell you 
is always the same 
her mind is engaged
in a rapt contemplation
of the thought 
of the thought  of the thought
of her name 
her ineffable 
effable 
effanineffable 
deep and inscrutable 
singular name  name 
name  name  name 
name  name  name  name

  jellicle cats
meet once a year  
  at the jellicle ball
where we all rejoice  
  and the jellicle leader
will soon appear  
  and make what is known
as the jellicle choice  
  when old deuteronomy
just before dawn  
  through a silence you feel
you could cut with a knife  
  announces the cat
who can now be reborn  
  and come back to
a different jellicle life  
  for waiting up there
is the heaviside layer  
  full of wonders
one jellicle only will see  
  and jellicles ask
because jellicles dare  
  who will it be   
chorus 
  who will it be   
the heaviside layer 
far  far up in the sky 
from where
the most deserving cat
will be reborn
into another life 
so they can be who they ve
always dreamed of being 
how will they be chosen 
by singing the song
of themselves  of course 
who they are and what they do 
come 
come and see a cat
who s competing
to be the jellicle choice
tonight 
  i have a gumbie cat in mind  
    her name is jennyanydots  
   yawns 
  her coat is
of the tabby kind  
  with tiger stripes
and leopard spots  
  all day she sits
upon the stair  
  or on the step  
   groaning 
    or on the mat  
  she sits and sits and sits  
  and sits  
  and that s what makes
a gumbie cat  
  that s what makes
a gumbie cat  
 jennyanydots grunting 
  but     
  when the day s
hustle and bustle is done  
  then the gumbie cat s work
is but hardly begun  
  and when all the family s
in bed and asleep  
  i tuck up my skirts
to the basement to creep  
  i am deeply concerned  
  with the ways of the mice  
  their behavior s not good  
  and their manners not nice  
  so when i have got them
lined up on the matting  
  i teach them music 
crocheting and tatting  
  diddly dup  diddly dup 
diddly dup wup boo  
  diddy dup  diddly dup  
  diddly dup wup boo  
  diddy dup  diddly dup 
diddly dup  
    wah  wah  
    a doo ba doo ba doo  
  ba doo ba biddly da doo da  
  waddly wah  waddly wah  
it s dinner and a show 
  wah wah  waddly wah  
  waddly wah 
waddly wah wah wah  
jennyanydots 
  a doo ba doo ba doo  
 scatting

munkustrap 
  i have a gumbie cat in mind  
    her name is jennyanydots  
  mice    jennyanydots  
  the curtain cord
she likes to wind  
  and tie it into  
    sailor knots  
   groaning    ooh 
  she sits upon
the windowsill  
  or anything
that s smooth and flat  
    she sits and sits  
   groans 
  and sits and sits  
 grunts 
  and that s what makes
a gumbie cat  
  that s what makes  
  a gumbie cat  
  but     
  when the day s
hustle and bustle is done  
  then the gumbie cat s work
is but hardly begun  
  i think that the cockroaches
need employment  
  to prevent them from idle
and wanton destroyment  
  so i formed from that lot
of disorderly louts  
  a troop of well disciplined 
helpful boy scouts  
  with a purpose in life
and a good deed to do  
  and i ve even created  
  a beetles tattoo  
 rhythmic drumbeat
and footsteps 
jennyanydots 
cockroaches  faces 
mm   grunts 
and now for
the icing on the cake 
why does she want
another jellicle life 
i can t keep being
in this kitchen 
don t get cocky 
 scoffs 
 laughs 
  so for old gumbie cats
let s now give three cheers  
  on whom well ordered
households depend  it appears  
  three cheers 
three cheers  three cheers  
  thank you  my dears

  if you put me in a flat

  remark the cat  
  who hesitates towards you  
  in the light of the door  
  which opens on her  
  like a grin  
  you see the border
of her coat  
  is torn  
  and stained with sand  
  and you see  
  the corner of her eye twist  
  like a crooked pin  
    and  
    she haunted  
  many a low resort  
  near the grimy road  
  of tottenham court  
  she flitted about  
  the no man s land  
  from the rising sun  
  to the friend at hand  
  and the postman sighed  
  as he scratched his head  
  you d really have thought  
  she d ought to be dead

  my visits are occasional

  for any one cat
to belong both to that  
  and the
joint superior schools

  for a similar reason 
when game is in season  
    i m found not at fox s but blimp s

  i am frequently seen  
  at the gay stage and screen  
  which is famous

  i m a 25 pounder
or i am a bounder  
  and i m putting on weight
every day

why don t you come inside 
    mungojerrie  
    and rumpelteazer  
  we re a notorious
couple of cats  
    as knockabout clowns  
    quick change comedians  
    tightrope walkers  
    and acrobats  
  we have
an extensive reputation  
  we make our home
in victoria grove  
  this is merely our center
of operation  
  for we are incurably
given to rove  
  we are very well known  
  in cornwall gardens 
in launceston place  
  and in kensington square  
  we have really
a little more reputation  
  than a couple of cats
can very well bear  
no photos  right 
  if the area window
is found ajar  
  and the bedroom
looks like a field of war  
  if a tile or two  
    comes loose on the roof  
   tile shatters 
  which presently fails  
    to be waterproof  
   tile shatters 
  if the drawers are pulled out
from the bedroom chest  
  and you can t find
one of your winter vests  
  or after supper
one of the girls  
  suddenly misses
her woolworth pearls  
  the family will say  
   it s that horrible cat   
  it was mungojerrie  
  or rumpelteazer  
  and most of the time
they leave it at that  
 laughing 
 laughs 
  mungojerrie
and rumpelteazer  
  have a very unusual
gift of the gab  
  we re highly efficient
cat burglars as well  
  and remarkably smart  
    at the smash and grab  
   glass shatters 
  we make our home
in victoria grove  
  we have no regular
occupation  
  we are plausible fellows
who like to engage  
  a friendly policeman
in conversation  
hello  police officer 
i bought these for her myself 
  you did what 
  wait 
  when the family assembles  
  for sunday dinner  
  their minds made up
that they won t get thinner  
  on argentine joint 
potatoes and greens  
  then the cook would appear
from behind the scenes  
  and say in a voice
that is broken with sorrow  
   i m afraid you must wait
and have dinner tomorrow  
  for the joint is gone
from the oven like that   
  then the family will say  
   it s that horrible cat   
  it was mungojerrie  
  or rumpelteazer  
  and most of the time
they leave it at that  
    mungojerrie  
    and rumpelteazer  
  have a wonderful way
of working together  
  and some of the time
you would  
    say it was luck  
   grunts  gasps 
  and some of the time  
  you would say
it was weather  
  we go through the house
like a hurricane  
  and no sober person
could take his oath  
  was it mungojerrie   
  or rumpelteazer   
  or could you have sworn
that it might have been both   
  and when you hear
a dining room smash  
  or up from the pantry
there comes a loud crash  
  or down from the library
there comes a loud ping  
  from a vase that was
commonly said to be ming  
  then the family will say  
   now  which was which cat    
  it was mungojerrie  
  and  
  rumpelteazer  
  and there s nothing at all
to be done about that   
 vase wobbling

  a long while before
queen victoria s accession  
  old deuteronomy s  
  lived many lives  
  you know 
i am tempted to say 99  
  and her numerous progeny  
  prospers and thrives  
  and the village
is proud of her  
  in her decline  
  at the sight of that placid
and bland physiognomy  
  when she sits in the sun  
  on the vicarage wall  
  oldest inhabitant croaks  
   well  of all things  
   can it be really   
   yes  no  ho  hi

  jellicles

  jellicle cats

  jellicle cats
are rather small  
  jellicle cats
are merry and bright  
  and pleasant to hear
when they caterwaul  
   yowls 
    jellicle cats  
  have cheerful faces  
  jellicle cats have
bright black eyes  
  we like to practice
our airs and graces  
  and wait for
the jellicle moon to rise  
    jellicle cats develop slowly  
   meowing 
  jellicle cats
are not too big  
  jellicle cats are roly poly  
  we know how to dance
a gavotte and a jig  
  until the jellicle moon
appears  
  we make our toilette
and take our repose  
  jellicles wash
behind their ears  
  jellicles dry
between their toes  
  jellicle cats
are white and black  
  jellicle cats
are of moderate size  
  jellicles jump
like a jumping jack  
  jellicle cats
have moonlit eyes  
  jellicle cats
are black and white  
  jellicle cats 
as we said  are small  
  if it happens to be
a stormy night  
  we ll practice
a caper or two in the hall  
  if it happens
the sun is shining bright  
  you would say we had
nothing to do at all  
  we are resting and saving
ourselves to be right  
  for the jellicle moon
and the jellicle ball  
  jellicle cats 
come out tonight  
  jellicle cats 
come one  come all  
  the jellicle moon
is shining bright  
  jellicles

   music speeds up 
   breathing continues faster 
   music ends 
   jellicles panting 
 panting 
  silence  
  not a sound
from the pavement  
  has the moon lost
her memory   
  she is smiling alone  
  in the lamplight  
  the withered leaves
collect at my feet  
  and the wind  
  begins to moan  
  every streetlamp  
  seems to beat  
  a fatalistic warning  
  someone mutters  
  and the streetlamp gutters  
  and soon it will be morning  
  memory  
  all alone in the moonlight  
  i can smile at the old days  
  i was beautiful then  
  i remember  
  the time i knew
what happiness was  
  let the memory live  
  again   
  follow me home  
  if you dare to  
  i wouldn t know  
  where to lead you  
  should i take chances  
  when no one
took chances on me   
  so i watch from the dark 
wait for my life to start  
  with no beauty in my memory  
  all that i wanted  
  was to be wanted  
  too young to wander
london streets  
  alone and haunted  
  born into nothing  
  at least you have something  
  something to cling to  
  visions of dazzling rooms  
  i ll never get let into  
  and the memories
were lost long ago  
  but at least you have
beautiful ghosts  
  and so maybe my home
isn t what i had known  
  what i thought it would be  
  but i feel so alive  
  with these
phantoms of night  
  and i know that
this life isn t safe  
  but it s wild and it s free  
  all that i wanted  
  was to be wanted  
  i ll never wander
london streets  
  alone and haunted  
  born into nothing  
  with them i have something  
  something to cling to  
  i never knew i d love
this world they let me into  
  and the memories
were lost long ago  
  so i ll dance with
these beautiful ghosts  
  the memories
were lost long ago  
  so i ll dance with
these beautiful  
  ghosts   
  the moments of happiness  
  we had the experience  
  but missed the meaning  
  and approach to the meaning  
  restores the experience  
  in a different form  
  beyond any meaning  
  we can assign to happiness  
  the past experience  
  revived in the meaning  
  is not the experience  
  of one life only  
  but of many generations  
  not forgetting  
  something that is
probably quite  
  ineffable   
are you all right  my dear 
we haven t met before  have we 
no 
i m not from round here 
i was abandoned 
oh  poor thing 
would you like to see me make
the jellicle choice 
  am i allowed 
  why wouldn t you be allowed 
i m not a jellicle 
not yet  perhaps 
come  we re about to begin 
 quiet lapping 
gus 
gus  it s your call 
 gus exhales sharply 
i just wanted to wish you   
  jolly good luck 
  oh 
i m a tremendous fan
of your work

  what s your name 
  mr  mistoffelees 
i m a magic cat  you see

oh 
  do you ever get nervous 
  no  no 
it s all practice 
practice  practice 
then nothing can go wrong

i ve never played

the theatre cat 
cross paws 
mm 
  gus is the cat  
  at the theater door  
  uh  my name  as i ought
to have told you before  
  is really asparagus  
  but that s such a fuss
to pronounce  
  that they usually
call me just gus  
mm 
  my coat s very shabby  
  i m thin as a rake  
  and i suffer from palsy
which makes my paws shake  
  yet i was  in my youth 
quite the smartest of cats  
  though no longer a terror
to mice or to rats  
  for i m not the cat
that i was in my prime  
  though my name was
quite famous  
  they say  in my time  
  and whenever i join
my friends at their club  
  which takes place at the back
of the neighboring pub  
  i love to regale them 
if someone else pays  
  with anecdotes drawn
from my palmiest days  
  for i once was a star
of the highest degree  
  i have acted with irving  
 chuckles  
  i ve acted with tree  
  and i like to recall
my success on the halls  
  when the gallery once gave me
seven catcalls  
  but my grandest creation  
  as i love to tell  
  was firefrorefiddle  
  the fiend of the fell  
 snarls 
 laughing 
   gus grunts 
   sighs 
  then if someone will give me
a toothful of gin  
  i will tell how i once played
a part in east lynne  
  in a shakespeare performance
i once walked on pat  
  when some actor suggested
the need for a cat  
  and i say now these kittens  
  they do not get trained  
  as we did in the days
when victoria reigned  
  they do not get drilled
in a regular troupe  
  and they think it is smart
just to jump through a hoop  
  and i say as i scratch myself
with my claws  
  well  the theater is
certainly not what it was  
  these modern productions
are all very well  
  but there s nothing
to equal  
  from what i hear tell  
  that moment of mystery  
  when i made history  
  as firefrorefiddle  
  the fiend of the fell     
 thunder crashing 
   song ends 
   thunder fades 
 applause  jellicles yowling 
i could do it again  you know 
 applause  yowling continue

bravo 
bravo  gus 
could i trouble you for
an au    an autograph  sir

to see firefrorefiddle

  skimbleshanks
the railway cat  
  the cat of
the railway train  
  there s a whisper
down the line at 11 39  
  when the night mail s
ready to depart  
  saying   skimble 
where is skimble   
   has he gone to hunt
the thimble   
  we must find him
or the train can t start   
  all the guards
and all the porters  
  and the stationmaster s
daughters  
  would be searching
high and low  
  saying   skimble 
where is skimble   
   for unless he s
very nimble  
  then the night mail
just can t go   
  at 11 42
with the signal overdue  
  and the passengers
all frantic to a man  
  that s when i would appear  
  and i d saunter to the rear  
  i d been busy
in the luggage van  
  then he gives one flash
of his glass green eyes  
  and the signal goes
 all clear   
  and we re off at last
for the northern part  
  of the northern hemisphere  
 blows whistle 
 rhythmic tapping 
 tapping continues faster

  the cat of
the railway train  
  you could say that
by and large  
  it was me who was in charge
of the sleeping car express  
  from the driver
and the guards  
  to the bagmen playing cards  
  i would supervise them all 
more or less  
  i will watch you
without winking  
  and i ll see
what you are thinking  
  and it s certain
that i wouldn t approve  
  of hilarity and riot  
  so the folk are very quiet  
  when skimble is about
and on the move  
  you can play no pranks
with skimbleshanks  
  i m a cat that
cannot be ignored  
  so nothing goes wrong
on the northern mail  
  when skimbleshanks
is aboard  
  oh  it s very pleasant  
  when you ve found your
little den with your name  
    written up on the door  
    whoo whoo   
  and the berth is very neat
with a newly folded sheet  
  and there s not a speck
of dust on the floor  
  then the guard
looks in politely  
  and will ask you
very brightly  
   do you like
your morning tea  
  weak or strong    
  but i was just behind him
and was ready to remind him  
  for skimble won t let
anything go wrong  
  when you creep into
your cozy berths  
  and pull up the counterpane  
  you ought to reflect
that it s very nice  
  to know that you won t be  
    bothered by mice  
   mouse squeaking 
  you can leave all that
to the railway cat  
  the cat of
the railway train  
  skimbleshanks
the railway cat  
  the cat of
the railway train  
  and he gives you a wave
of his long brown tail  
  which says
 i ll see you again   
  you will meet without fail
on the midnight mail

 macavity laughing 
macavity 
  macavity s a mystery cat  
  he s called the hidden paw  
  for he s
the master criminal  
  who can defy the law  
  he s the bafflement
of scotland yard  
    the flying squad s despair  
   sniffs  huffs 
  for when they reach
the scene of crime  
  macavity s not there  
 grunts 
  macavity  macavity  
  there s no one
like macavity  
  he s broken every human law  
  he breaks the law
of gravity  
  his powers of levitation  
  would make a fakir stare  
  but when they reach
the scene of crime  
  macavity s not there  
  macavity s a ginger cat  
  he s very tall and thin  
  you would know him
if you saw him  
  for his eyes are sunken in  
  his brow is deeply lined
with thought  
  his head is highly domed  
  his coat is dusty
from neglect  
  his whiskers are uncombed  
  he sways his head
from side to side  
  with movements like a snake  
  and when you think
he s half asleep  
  he s always  
  wide awake   
  macavity  macavity  
  there s no one
like macavity  
  for he s a fiend
in feline shape  
  a monster of depravity  
  you may meet him
in a bystreet  
  you may see him
in the square  
  but when a crime s
discovered  then  
  macavity s not there  
  he s outwardly respectable  
  i know he cheats at cards  
  and his footprints
are not found  
  in a any files  
  of scotland yard s  
  and when
the larder s looted  
  and the jewel case
is rifled  
  or when the milk is missing  
  or another peke s
been stifled  
  or the greenhouse glass
is broken  
 glass shatters 
  and the trellis past repair  
  there s the wonder
of the thing  
  macavity s not there  
  macavity  macavity  
  there s no one
like macavity  
  there never was
a cat of such  
  deceitfulness and suavity  
  he always has an alibi  
  and one or two to spare  
  whatever time
the deed took place  
  macavity wasn t there  
  and they say that
all the cats  
  whose wicked deeds
are widely known  
  i might mention mungojerrie  
  rumpelteazer  griddlebone  
  are nothing more
than agents  
  for the cat
who all the time  
  just controls
the operations

there was nobody shyer

on the roof  
  when i was curled up
by the fire  
  and i ve sometimes
been heard by the fire  
  when i was about
on the roof  
  at least they all heard
that somebody purred  
  which is
incontestable proof  
  of my singular
magical powers  
  and i ve known
the family to call  
  me in from the garden
for hours  
  when i was asleep
in the hall

  cat   
  you ve heard
of several kinds of cat  
  and my opinion now is that  
  you should need
no interpreter  
  to understand our character  
  you ve learned enough
to take the view  
  that cats are
very much like you  
  you ve seen us both
at work and games  
  and learnt about
our proper names  
  our habits and our habitat  
  but how would you
ad dress a cat   
  so first
your memory i ll jog  
  and say a cat is not  
  a dog  
  so first
your memory i ll jog  
  and say a cat is not  
  a dog  
  with cats  
  some say one rule is true  
  don t speak till you  
  are spoken to  
  myself  i do not
hold with that  
  i say you should
ad dress a cat  
  but always
bear in mind that he  
  resents familiarity  
  you bow  
  and taking off your hat  
  ad dress him in this form  
  o cat  
  o cat  
  before a cat
will condescend  
  to treat you
as a trusted friend  
  some little token of esteem  
  is needed 
like a dish of cream  
  or you might
now and then supply  
  some caviar
or strasbourg pie  
  some potted grouse
or salmon paste  
  he s sure to have
his personal taste  
  and so in time
you reach your aim  
  and call him  
  by his name  
  a cat s entitled to expect  
  these evidences of respect  
  so this is this  
  and that is that  
  and that s how you ad dress  
  a cat   
 birds chirping 
i believe you truly are
a jellicle cat 
a dear little cat

  beautiful ghosts 
by taylor swift playing 
  follow me home  
  if you dare to  
  i wouldn t know  
  where to lead you  
  should i take chances  
  when no one
took chances on me   
  so i watch from the dark 
wait for my life to start  
  with no beauty in my memory  
  all that i wanted  
  was to be wanted  
  too young to wander
london streets  
  alone and haunted  
  born into nothing  
  at least you have something  
  something to cling to  
  visions of dazzling rooms  
  i ll never get let into  
  and the memories
were lost long ago  
  but at least you have
beautiful ghosts  
  perilous night  
  their voices calling  
  a flicker of light  
  before the dawning  
  out here the wild ones  
  are taming the fear
within me  
  scared to call them
my friends  
  and be broken again  
  is this hope
just a mystical dream   
  all that i wanted  
  was to be wanted  
  too young to wander
london streets  
  alone and haunted  
  born into nothing  
  at least you have something  
  something to cling to  
  visions of dazzling rooms  
  i ll never get let into  
  and the memories
were lost long ago  
  but at least you have
beautiful ghosts  
  and so maybe my home  
  isn t what i had known  
  what i thought it would be  
  but i feel so alive  
  with these
phantoms of night  
  and i know that
this life isn t safe  
  but it s wild and it s free  
  all that i wanted  
  was to be wanted  
  i ll never wander
london streets  
  alone and haunted  
  born into nothing  
  with them i have something  
  something to cling to  
  i never knew i d love  
  this world
they ve let me into  
  and the memories
were lost long ago  
  so i ll dance with
these beautiful ghosts  
  and the memories
were lost long ago
