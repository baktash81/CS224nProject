of monetary damage

there were a total of six gators  sir 
the largest being four feet even   
the smallest being  uh    24 inches 
eh  probably just a bunch of kids
screwin  around 
well  that was my original assumption   
but with all due respect 
captain  i mean   
h how many kids do you know
that could handle a four foot alligator 
i think we re dealing
with  uh  you know   
with a maybe more
sophisticated syndicate   
you know  somebody that really has it in
for  uh  mother paula s   
you know  possibly a    a revenge type deal 
  revenge 
  yes 
like  you know  a    a rival pancake house 
that s a great piece of police work 
officer delinko 
and then also l   
hey  look  sherlock   
there are no other pancake houses
in coconut cove 
i got the mayor calling me about   
 coconut cove s economy
needs mother paula s  
so  go rub those two little brain cells
of yours together   
then get out there and catch the punks   
that are messin 
with that construction site 
no need to worry  sir  i am on the case 
i m all over it 
that s precisely what i m worried about 
nobody in the history
of trace middle school   
has ever hit a matherson before 
  you re a legend already 
  look   
look  i m glad i can
make my mark on history 
ok  look    iook  i wrote him a note

a note 
that s adorable 
what d you say 
 sorry i smoked you   
 please don t break every bone in my body 
 please leave me one good arm

those baby owls are toast 
yeah  yeah  i ve seen those owls 
wait  you have 
why don t they just
build somewhere else 
we tried to tell them about the nest   
but all we got back was this form letter
from this jerk named muckle   
saying they had all the permits
they needed to build 
they don t care about little birds 
my brother s been trying
to stall them ever since 
uhh   
hey  hey  you ok

uhh    i feel like a million bucks 
uhh   
hey  h    unh 
uhh  uhh 
let s get him to a hospital 
the central florida shrimping industry
has suffered major   
are you a big boy
with a big appetite 
you betcha  i am 
then come on down
to mother paula s   
for our famous all you can eat
pancake buffet 
  mother paula s  we cover the world  
huh 
  one flapjack at a     
what are you up to now 
uh   
uh   
uh 
aah 
this is bad  cowgirl 
really bad 
don t worry 
he s gonna be fine 
i m worried about him 
i ve never seen him act like this 
which one of you
is roy eberhardt 
  he is 
  he is 
  police officer 
  hi  there 
what s this about 
must be roy s parents 
i m officer delinko  c c p d 
  ok 
  hi 
anyhoo  i  uh 
i met roy the other day   
he got a flat 
i gave him a ride home 
so  when i heard over the radio
that he was in the hospital   
and they couldn t reach
his parents by the phone   
i figured i d just come by
and see if i could find y all 
  in the hospital 
  oh  my god 
  is he ok 
  oh  yeah  sorry 
no  he s   
he  uh  he got bit by a dog 
he s gonna be fine 
that s the word 
so  uh  you a police officer 
mr  eberhardt 
i m with the department of justice 
where s roy at 
oh  right  sorry 
he s um   
he s over in the hospital
on eighth street 
honey 
so  wow 
department of justice 
we oughta get together
and swap stories sometime 
i d  uh  take you over there myself 
but i m in this   
this  uh  smallish vehicle  and you ii   
probably get there before me 
let s go 
anyways 
i m in    this thing 
this    this   
tell me again what happened 
from the beginning 
all right 
a dog the size of a buick
attacked roy at soccer practice 
he came home all chewed up   
so we brought him here
as fast as we could 
it s true 
n no  i believe your brother
was attacked by a dog   
i just don t believe
that it happened today 
judging by how far
the infection has progressed   
i d estimate he was bitten   
eighteen to twenty four hours ago 
yeah  eighteen hours 
that sounds about right 
because he  um   
he  uh  right  he passed out
right after he got bit 
it wasn t until the next day
that beatrice called me and asked me   
if i d help get him to a hospital 
i see  and   
where are your parents 
  their parents   
  well   
their parents  they  uh 
they work on a crab boat 
and you are 
uh   
  ling ho 
  uh  ok 
here s what s going to happen 
i m going to go attend to roy 
and then the three of us
are gonna sit down   
and somebody s gonna
start telling me the truth 
ok 
ling ho 
ling ho 
you couldn t come up with anything
better than ling ho 
uh   
this is not gonna work  cowgirl 
once they figure out
that mullet s not you   
they re gonna put him in juvey   
or lana s gonna
ship him off somewhere   
where he can t run away 
don t worry 
we ll come up with something 
i bet you will  cowgirl 
but i gotta go 
but wait    wait 
where are you going 
to fix dinner for my dad 
i do it every night 
i ll be back in an hour 
i promise 
you re kidding  right 
hey  come on 
get that tin can outta the road 
we tried to get a hold of you 
but his friend said you were out at sea 
that you work on a crab boat 
what 
anyway  he was bitten by a dog 
so we ve got him on an antibiotic drip 
with a little rest  he should be just fine 
where s roy 
i just   
i mean  i really   
ahh 
i don t know 
you don t know  one minute there s
an injured boy in this bed   
the next minute  he just vanished 
and how can you lose the one
and only patient that you have 
mom  dad 
i m right here

no  of course it is 
guys  i didn t get bit 
it wasn t me 
ahh  excuse me  folks

roy  who was in that bed 
and where did he go 
and i wanna know now 
i don t know his real name 
and i don t know where he went 
i m sorry 
but that s the truth 
let me explain  all he was
trying to do was save the owls 
if the mother paula s
people bulldoze that lot   
they ll bury all the dens 
owls ll be gone 
roy  it s their property 
but it doesn t mean that it s right  dad 
those owls can t
fight for themselves 
somebody s gotta stick up for them 
that s all he was trying to do 
ahh 
you re just getting settled here  roy 
why you wanna get mixed up in all this 
i wasn t looking for it 
it just happened 
what just happened 
some pirate kid hassling
a construction site 
i didn t do anything
to that construction site 
i m not finished 
roy  you broke a kid s nose 
you got    you got  uh 
suspended from the school bus

you know what i mean 
you re saying it s a lost cause  right 
hey  come on  tex

you were hurt 
you crossed the line   cause you cared
about what happened to me 
hey  come on

  reflections  not just replays  
  takin  time to escape the maze  
what is that 
  lookin  for better days  
  looking to the left  
  looking to the right  
  looking to the stars
to shed some light  
  hoping for a breath  
  hoping for break  
  hopin  for the give without the take

mom and dad realized they liked florida
just as much as i did   
and they decided to stay here
and make this our home 
for good 
after all the bad publicity 
the pancake company   
couldn t back off the promises
made that day by mother paula 
they ended up donating the land
as a wildlife preserve 
the owls are still there   
and you could see them
if you re real quiet 
beatrice and i became best of friends
and i never missed a soccer game 
attendance was mandatory 
left  right

and got his first
unmarked patrol car

backed it off a fishing pier 
while serving his ninety days
of community service   
chuck muckle was hit in the head
by a falling coconut 
the judge gave him another thirty days
for lying down on the job 
curly brannit quit his job

of letting me know
